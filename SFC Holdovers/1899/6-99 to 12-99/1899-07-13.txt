OREGON VOLUNTEERS SAIL THROUGH THE GOLDEN GATE
â 3 HE Second Oregon Volunteer
Regiment. Colonel Owen Sum
mers, commanding, minus only
Jj, those who fell ln battle or died
in the hospitals at Manila, ar
rived In port yesterday on the army
transports Newport and Ohio, after an
uneventful voyage of twenty-seven
days on summer seas, all fairly well
on board. The reception they received
could not have been warmer had they
been the best beloved sons of Califor
nia.
The transports were sighted at 2
o'clock in the afternoon off Point Reyes
and reported to the city by telephone.
In less than half an hour afterward,
the water, front from Meiggs Wharf to
the Folsom-street pier was alive with
humanity, awaiting the chance to yell
itself hoarse, to cheer and to wave its
myriad handkerchiefs \in greeting to
the home-coming boys ln brown. Flags
were shot out on the city's poles and
bunting was spread on every craft on
the bay; whistles tooted and tooted in
the hope that some echo of their inhar
monious concert might reach the home
ward bound; small craft and large craft,
whitehalls, yachts, tugs, launches and
ferry boats, crowded with people, be
gan moving to and fro in the vicinity
of the ferry depot, impatient for the
meeting. Crowds upon crowds lined the
edge of the water front, thronged the
piers and swarmed all over tne gaily
decorated ships moored alongside. The
wooden boundaries of the bay were ob
scured by walls of people eager to tes
tify their joy at the return of the Ore
gonlans and to add to the welcome the
Governor of the northern State and his
party had come to give their soldier
boys.
Governor Geer and his staff, in full
uniform, were at the Presidio with
Major General Shafter and staff,
lunching with Colonel Freeman, the
commandant of the post, when they
learned the news. They hastened at
once to the berth of the State tug. Gov
ernor Irwin, next to the transport dock
at Howard street. They were compell- \
< d to push their way through a big
crowd. On the dock they were met by
Adjutant General Seamans, N. G. C,
and staff. Harbor Commissioners Har
ney and Herold and officers of the
_u_val militia.
At 4 o'clock, its whistle tooting and
flags and bunting flying, the Governor
Irwin steamed out into the stream,
amid shrieking of whistles, turning
eastward by direction of the adjutant
general, to pass the Marion at Folsom-
Ftreet Wharf. The party on the Irwin
consisted of: ,
Governor Geer, Adjutant General
Tuttle and wife. Colonel Davige M.
Dunn and wife. Major A. B. Gillis, Mrs.
Jorgensen, Colonel S. C. Spencer and
wife, Major J. Mel. Wood, Captain E.
C. Mears, Mrs. M. B. Jackson, Misses
Nellie and Katie Flavel.
General Shatter, accompanied by
Lieutenant Colonel Plummer of the
Thirty-fifth Infantry, Major R. H.
Noble, Captain William H. McKittrick,
U. S. A., and R. D. Clark of New York.
With Adjutant General W. H. Sea
mans were Colonel J. F. Bergin, Lieu
tenant Colonels F. E. Beck, J. R. How
ell, J. S. Young, W. B. Sanborn, Assist
ant Adjutant General Thomas Cluff,
Major L.' F. Schmidt, Lieutenant
Colonel and Engineer Officer of Di
vision Charles L. Murphy and Captain
Hewes of the Signal Corps.
Captain Lewis H. Turner, Lieutenant
Commander Nierney and Lieutenant
Harlow of the Naval Battalion.
Colonel Jackson, retired, of the Sec
ond United States Cavalry, now in
spector general of Governor Geer's
staff, Surgeon General Greenleaf, U. S.
A., Dr. Pethers and Dr. O'Brien were
also on board.
As the bow of the Irwin shot into
view of the watchers the first shot of a
seventeen-gun salute was fired in honor
of Governor Geer, shot after shot fol
lowing until the tug had passed the
Naval Battalion boat and was turning
westward again to meet the incoming
transports. The tooting of the whistles
of the 'lrwin was notice to the other
vessels in the harbor that the chorus
could come in, and for the space of two
minutes one could not hear oneself
think so great was the din. The walls
of humanity along the front became
wildly animated and waved hats, hands
and handkerchiefs in the effort to con
vert themselves into human sema
phores to wigwag a godspeed to the
Gubernatorial party.
From every pier there darted out to
follow in the wake of the Oregonian
party gayly decorated craft laden with
sightseers, and long before the Irwin
had puffed abreast of Meiggs wharf
there was a beautiful naval parade.
The day was ideal for such a purpose.
The breeze was blowing in stiffly from
the ocean, fluttering out the flags, the
salty bay water was spraying in the
sunlight and the parading boats were
laden with beautiful, women and offi
cers in full regimentals.
Meiggs wharf, marking the end of the
city's water front, presented a beauti
ful sight. Several thousand people,
waving flags and head wear and white
kerchiefs, cheered as the welcoming
party passed, and the many flags on
the barge office caught just then an
extra blast of the breeze that dipped
them as if in salute.
Every rye was strained ahead for a
first glimpse of the transports. Gov
ernor Geer and the members of his
party took the stern of the boat for it,
with General Shatter and his staff,
where the spray could not reach them.
The San Francisco Call.
The Governor of Their State and His Military JStaff
Welcome Them on the Bay. a la/B,
From time to time hands shaded eyes
that peered out into the sunlit waste
of waters, but so strong was the glare
through the Gate that it was not until
the Governor Irwin was off the Fair
water lots that the smoke of the first
transport was seen to rise through the
haze.
"It's the Newport," was the cry, fol
lowed immediately by shrill blasts of
every "whistleable" thing in sight.
Sure enough, it was the Newport,
steam up and smoking like a furnace,
just entering the Gate. The Ohio could
not be made out, however, until some
five minutes afterward, when her com
ing was heralded by another cloud of
smoke a short distance behind. More
blowing of whistles greeted her com- |
ing, and the Jaunty quarantine launch
shot out from Meiggs wharf and the j
crowds on the small craft began j
wondering whether or not the yellow j
flag she was flying meant that the re- :
turning volunteers would be tied up in
a heart-breaking quarantine.

other small fry headed out, and nearer |

and nearer they t came to the Newport, I
until it was easy to distinguish the fig- j
ures of men moving about the decks. !
Then Captain Hewes of the, Signal j
Corps of the California National Guard i
get out his little wigwag flag and made
motions which signified to the men on I
the transport that the Governor of Ore
gon was aboard the tug. A faint cheer j
could be heard coming across the ;
waters, and Governor Geer moved for- I
ward, climbed on the top of' the pilot j
house and' stood to welcome the regi- j
ment. The ladies of the Oregon party !
also moved, forward and several; of
them climbed the ladder to stand along- 1
side the Governor to get a first glimpse !
of the boys. ,_ .
Op the other tug the usual manifesta
tions of joy were being made. The eter
nal whistle was kept a- tooting, the pas
sengers shouted and shrieked and 'â 
shrilled their Joy. and, on the Sea j
Queen, the band started up "Home, |
Sweet Home," following it up with the !
suggestive lilt, "When Johnnie Comes j
Marching Home."
By this time the Newport was well i
inside and very close to the oncomir g j
tugs, so that the cheers .of the soldiers j
on the one and their wellwishers "on the j
other mingled in unison. The big trans- [

port began to slow up and to sound Its
whistle. The men on board could be
distinguished very plainly and It was
but a few seconds before their voices
could be heard in one cry:
"Frisco! Frisco! Muster us out in
Frisco!"
Cheers greeted this yell from every
welcoming boat and from none louder
than the Governor Irwin, where the gu-
bernatorial party was of the mind that
the wishes of the boys were the views
of their friends. *
And the band on the Sea, Queen
played, the soldier boys cheered and
their friends cheered back the faint
echoes of cheers could be heard from j
the wharves, whistles were blowing on j
the bay and on shore, but regularly '
above it all could be heard the strong I
soldier chorus:
"Frisco! Frisco! Muster us out at I
Frisco!" .
By this time the transport and the
State tug had come close together and
hoys from Manila were given a sight
of the Governor' who had succeeded ,
Governor Lord, by whom they were I

sent away. The tail figure of Governor
Geer was sharply outlined agalnct the
clear sky- as he stood bareheaaed on
the pilot house, waving his hat to the
cheers that were hurled at him.
"Hello, Governor, how's things at
home?", .was the most frequent greet
ing that fell on his ears, being sand
wiched in often between the steady
cries of "Frisco! Frisco! Muster us
out in Frisco!"
The Newport slowed to a stop at last,
the quarantine officers boarded her and
the Governor Irwin and other tugs went
alongside and there followed for the
next fifteen minutes such a flinging back
and forth of questions and answers as
has never before been heard on the
bay. Bundles, of newspapers were
tossed \ to the men on . board and
eagerly scrambled for. Scraps of in
formation to the effect that Jeff was
the champion, or that Fitz had been
knocked out by the Californlan were
eagerly devoured. Between the Gover
nor and . members of his party and the
officers and men on board the transport
there was a continued cross-fire of
questions. Away up on the bridge, the
white-headed figure 'of Brevet Briga
dier General Summers waved a greet
ing to the crowds in the boats below.
"How are you, Governor?" he cried
out. .
"I'm all right," said Governor Geer.
"How are all the boys?"
"Fine as silk," came the cheery an
swer, and the appearance of the men on
the Newport confirmed \ the, statement
and the rumor that' had floated around
in one way or another that the health
on board was good and that the" voy-
SCENES ATTENDING THE RETURN OF THE OREGON VOLUNTEERS
age up had been on a millpond. The
information was soon gleaned that the
few wounded aboard were on the rapid
road to recovery, that the- volunteers
had a perfect menagerie aboard, con
taining everything from a Chinese
"choo" dog to the wildest kind of a
monkey and ' the most agile Filipino
goat. Two ex-Spanish soldiers, it was
also explained, had been brought up,
perfectly satisfied with their new du
ties as company cooks. The head of a
young Filipino sticking out of one of
the portholes was the . signal for con
siderable inquiry, which was met with
the response that he had been captured
in a raid on one of Aguinaldo's bands
and was quite contented with his posi
tion as "kicker" for Captain Heath of
Company H. His . name is Manuel
Robles and he has succeeded In acquir
ing sufficient of the English .tongue on
his voyage to carry him for the ; rest
of his life.
Greetings having been exchanged all
along the line of the Newport^ the Gov
ernor's party, was headed far the Ohio,
which was rapidly nearing, its' whistles
blowing and its men cheering. Through
an : oversight, the- band } having been
placed on the Sea, Queen, the two bat
talions on the Ohio gained the impres
sion- that the Oregonian party which
they expected --was on that tug. \ The
consequence was that all craned their
necks in the direction ' of the Queen,
and despite the most faithful wigwag
ging of Captain Hewes they persisted
In believing that their Governor was'
anywhere else than on the Irwin.' â â 
"This Is the. Governor of Oiegon!
This is the Governor of Oregon!" time
after time shouted the officers on the
Irwin, but the boys on. the Ohio were
set in their notions and kept on cheer
ing and shouting toward the Sea Queen
the refrain started by their brothers on
the Newport, "Frisco! Frisco! Muster
us out in Frisco!" â¢
At last they, too, slowed up. â¢ and a
similar scene to the one enacted a few
minutes before on and around the New
port was. repeated. The Governor, lo-
cated at last, was cheered lustily, and
responded ' by waving his hands and
bowing. In time the Irwin ran alongside
the second transport; and the same,
questions were asked and the same.
answers were given- as had been ex
changed a few minutes before. The
same whistlings and greetings and
cheerings were given again, and again
the information was* obtained that all
was well on board, the wounded im
proving splendidly and only one case
of sickness, that of Hotchkiss of H
Company, who was on the road to re
covery after having passed the ecu*.*;
stage of pneumonia.
Back again to the Newport the Irwin
steamed and there were more greet
ings, a plank was stretched across
and the Governor and the members of
his staff and the ladies of the party
went aboard. The wife of Colonel Sum
mers, who had awaited as patiently, as
possible the meeting with her. husband,
flew to the arms of the handsome colo
nel and for a full minute they hugged
each other, both being visibly affected
to tears.
That portion of the bay about the
brats was as animated as one could
wish, gay with color, alive with motion
and .vibrant with joyous sounds of
greeting. Tugs and launches [ were
thick as bees about the transport and
the bands on the transport Newport
and on the Sea Queen kept up a friend
ly rivalry that was beautiful; to f see.

efforts of which the tug had been se
cured, came up just as it- was five feet
from the wharf, but he refused to take
a chance. '-.*'â¢ '
The tug was decorated with an Amer
ican flag on the stern and the bear flag,
emblem of the order, at the bow. An
other string of bear flags ran from the
bow to the' top of the smoke stack.
Allen's Iroquois band, which had
been engaged by Mayor Phelan for the
occasion, accompanied the party, arid
the music was a feature which excited
the soldiers on the incoming transports
to a high pitch of enthusiasm. ,
On the Sea Queen .were Colonel Wil
liam P. Sullivan, who represented
Mayor Phelan ; Harbor Commissioners
Herold, Harney and Kilburn; Secretary
William D. English, Chief Engineer
Howard Holmes, Chief ; , Wharfinger
Percy Henderson, 'Assistant Chief

Sons' committee, consisting of Sheriff
Henry S. Martin. William D. Shea, Su
perior Judge Frank H. Dunne, F. H.
Mills, Grand Secretary Henry Lun
stedt and James P. Dockery.
The Sea Queen, after greeting, the
men on the Newport,' followed in the
wake of the Ohio, and when the band
struck up "The Star-spangled Banner"
every man on the transport took off his
hat and listened. .They stood bare
headed in a wind that ; played fantastic
tricks with their flowing locks, and
when the band finished there were
more cheers. "Some o>.' the Oregon boys
in their enthusiasm danced about the
decks when "Yankee Doodle" was
played, and the irrepressible man with

the camera was in evidence on the
transport.
At this time the tug Fearless went
alongside of the Ohio, and on board
were Captain A. Barnason, marine su
perintendent, and Captain N. P.
Bateheldor, assistant quartermaster.
The tug John H. Redmond came up
with Supervisor Bymgton. who had
missed the Sea Queen by ten seconds.
With him were Advisory Expert to the
Supervisors A. G. Piatt, Mark Devine
and ethers, who braved the choppy sea
and the attendant moisture in their
zeal to help in giving the incoming sol
diers a royal welcome.
Aftei a good view had been obtained
by the Interested sp.ctators of the Ohio
and its precious human freight the tug
turned back to the 1-ewport again. The
steamers Ukiah and S-usalito came up
also with crowds of passengers, and
when the band commenced to play
"Annie Laurie" hearty cheers again
resounded across the blue waters. The
United States steamer Gulden Gate
came alongside with the quarantine
officers and some of them boarded the
transport.
The Oregon party on the Irwin lin
gered latest at the side of the Newport
and the Governor, by a personal visit
among the boys on board, satisfied him
self that the cry of "Frisco! Frisco!
Muster Us Out at Frisco!" was the
unanimous sentiment of the men.
' The men had heard from the first
boat they met coming in through the
Golden . Gate, which happened to be
the tug Reliance, Captain Gilbert Bro
kaw, that they were to go on to As
toria. The information fell like a wet
blanket upon them, which they imme
diately raised by the spontaneous cry
that they wanted to be mustered out
in San Francisco. The Reliance tooted
her whistle in' reply and unrolled The
Call flag and flew the signal "Wel
come."
They wanted their first welcome ln
'Sari*. Francisco," and they took no pains
to conceal their desire. The Governor
was officially informed of. it by Colonel
Summers, who said: "The boys are
unanimous that they should be mus
tered, out here. It means $35,000 travel
pay sirid ration allowance to them and
they need the money. I am in favor of
mustering them out here. The Gov
ernor was of the same opinion, and
most of the members of his party, only
one or two thinking it would be better
for the men to be taken in the trans
ports to Oregon.
" 'Frisco! 'Frisco! Muster us out at
'Frisco!" the cry continued to go up as
if the very voicing of the desire would
compel the granting of the wish. An
official call on the captains of . the
transports for information concerning
their coal and provisions elicited the
replies that they had enough to take
them north, with the exception of
water for their bpilers. This informa
tion was hailed with delight by the
men who heard it. They knew it
meant some delay, and delay meant
the chance of a change in the orders.
Governor Geer and the members of
his party held a hasty consultation and
decided to send a telegram to Washing
ton asking that the wish o~" the men be
gratified. They also agreed to send
telegrams to Portland to raise a sub
scription to charter a train and take
the regiment up intact in case it should
be mustered out at this city. A whisper
of this got to the boys and they cheered
again and again, changing their song
to "Frisco! Frisco! They'll muster us
out at Frisco!"
Greetings were over at last, the cap
tains of the transports got their or
ders to haul in anchor and sail to a
mooring off Folsom-street wharf, the
Irwin steamed up and was off. the men
giving the Governor j and his party a
rousing cheer at leaving. In a few
minutes the transports were under way
and the whistles of the city started up
as they moved, drawing more thous
ands down to the army transport
wharf, where they gave the soldier
boys of the north a genuine: welcome.
A few of the officers of the regiment.
Colonel Su rimers among: others, came
ashore during the evening and register
ed at the Occidental, where they stated
as their opinion that the Government
would listen to the voice of the men
and muster them out here.
A dispatch was sent to the adjutant
general at Washington arid his reply is
expected to-day. Until he decides the
men must remain, on the transports.
If they ever do come ashore to be mus
tered out it is certain that even their
own Portland will not give them half
the welcome San Francisco is ready to
add to the greeting of yesterday.

Colonel Summers Speaks of
the Bravery of His
Men.
Early last evening Governor Geer
and Colonel Summers consulted as to
what was best to be done, what plans
had best be agreed upon for the muster
ing out of the Oregon Regiment. First
it -was decided to communicate with the
department at Washington, and this
telegram was forwarded to the adjutant
general: â¢; :

port, July 12, 1599.

ton. P. C. : Oregon troops just arrived;

Colonel Commanding Second Oregon Reg
iment.
Governor Geer sent the accompanying
telegram indorsing Colonel Summers'
request:
In deference to the unanimous wish of
the Oregon regiment, I indorse Colonel
Summers' request for mustering out in
San Francisco. T. T. GEER,
Governor of Oregon.
Word was next sent to Mr. Scott of
the Portland Oregonian informing him
of the plan decided upon, and word j
came back that -the people of Oregon j
favored the wish of the volunteers be- I
ing carried out, and then the dis
tinguished party retired to await word
from headquarters.
"Of the conditions in the Philippines i
I can say but little," said Colonel Sum
mers, "but if 1 had time I could say
much of the conduct, the bravery and j
the fortitude of the boys from Oregon. j
A general idea of our labors during th
campaigns may be gained through j
â¢knowledge of the fact that In twenty
eight days we had twenty-two engage- \
ments. We had forty-two engage- ;
ments in all during the five campaigns j
in which the regiment took part. The j
Ore-gonians had the distinction of con
stituting the only two flying brigades
in the field. Stripped to the undershirt
of blue and carrying nothing but. cut
guns and ammunition we made rapid
time and rendered, as we have been
told and know valuable service.
"Our hardest battle was at Malabon, |
where forty-seven of the regiment were j
wounded and nine killed. The total
number of our killed was sixty-two,
wounded eighty-six. A fact to be re
gretted is that we could not bring back |
the bodies of the boys who fell in bat- I
tle. It was found that the embalming !
process was a failure, and consequently j
the bodies must lie in their graves for ,
six months, after which time they will
be taken up, hermetically sealed and
returned, perhaps on a separate trans
port.
"In conclusion I will say this much
of the conditions in the Philippines.
While it is true that Lawton has suc
ceeded in breaking up the last of the :
large bodies under command of Aguin
aldo, there are still thousands of rebels |
in the field, and time alone will con
quer them. It will require a large
body of troops in order that captured j
territory may be held and cities evacu- |
ated by the Filipinos garrisoned to in- j
sure against their return.
"The death of General Luna was ac- ;
cepted favorably by all who heard it.
Doubtless he was the most dar.gerous
man in the rebel army, and his passing
was but little regretted. Just how
the noncombatants among the Filipinos
look upon the rebel forces it is hard to
tell. Whether they believe them to be j
martyrs or professional insurrectionists
is not known. The large majority of
Filipinos do but little thinking, and
have come to accept war as a natural
condition, but all have learned to know ;
and respect at least one thingâ the
fighting capacity of the American sol- j
dier."
"This is a proud day for me," said j
Governor Geer, "for I feel that our I
boys are coming home covered with
glory. The people of Oregon will ever I
honor thtir brave sons who enlisted at i
the first call and sailed away to Manila
to do their share of the fighting. 1 hey
will be royally received when they re
turn to their homes. At present all are
uncertain as to just how the muster
ing out of the regiment will be con
ducted or where. Until we hear from ;
the adjutant general at Washington
regarding the communication we have
forwarded no further plans will be
made. The talked-of plan of mustering
out in this city and calling upon the
people of Oregon to subscribe sufficient
funds with which to charter a train to ;
carry the boys to their homes has been
temporarily dropped, but in the event
of adverse news from Washington |
something must be done, and it is not j
improbable that this plan will be
adopted. AH we can do now is to await
developments."

When the big transport Newport was

fact that a number of stowaways were
aboard. A general search, was then in

THE HISTORY OF THE REGIMENT.
If ""T"" HE State of Oregon was called upon by President McKinley |J
I to furnish her quota of troops on April 25, 1898. Five days -m
â¢m I later Governor Lord made his appointment of officers and con- _
*L solidated the companies of the Oregon National Guard into _?
a the Second Regiment, Oregon Volunteers. Colonel O. Summers of ]g
J the First Regiment, O. N. G., was appointed colonel, taking com- -m
-m mand of the camp, relieving Colonel Gantenbein.
*" On. May 11 the First Battalion, consisting of Companies A, B, m
V C and D, in command of Major C. U. Gantenbein, under orders from J
it the War Department, broke camp and at 4:30 p. m. left for San -m
_. Francisco. The - battalion arrived here three days later. On their **
_5 arrival at the ferry the members of the battalion were royally B
~g treated by the Red Cross ladies of San Francisco. After they had J
iar been bedecked with flowers and warmed with coffee and edibles they -m
â  were marched to the Presidio through cheering crowds.
* The Second and Third Battalions broke camp' on May 16 and m
]Â» left Portland for this city in command of Colonel Summers. A jg
similar reception was accorded them here. The battalions joined
_* the camp of their fellow-soldiers and remained there, drilling and m
Jj preparing for their journey to the seat of war. |f

â " city. After four days the regiment re-embarked and continued on to â "
_f Guam. The honor of receiving the surrender of the Spanish garrison m

" The regiment remained in the latter place until after the sur- **

LOSES MONEY ON
FAKE FOOTRACE
Livermore Merchant Is
Bunkoed.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
STOCKTON, July 12.â A. Bistorious, a
merchant of Livermore, turned over $1000
to a trio of sharpers to-day. He parted
with his money on the ancient footrace
fake. Bistorious has strict business ideas,
but does not object to picking up a few
dollars on clean sport. Recently he met
a man giving the name of Gibson, at
Livermore, and soon became convinced
that he had made the acquaintance of
the greatest sprinter of the coast. Gib
son made â¢ a match which was to have
been pulled off at Livermore to-day, and
so confident was the merchant of his/
man's speed that he willingly put up
$1000 in. gold coin against a much less
amount offered by a man who was ' in
on the game."
All the parties met at Lathrop to-day.
A railroad man named Smith, said to be
from Livermore, was selected for referee,
and a Mr. Southwell of Lathrop became
stakeholder. Two men named Harrison
and Sampson also officiated in the affair.
The agreement was that the referee
should count three and then fire a re
volver as a signal for the start.
He fired the pistol but did no counting.
Bistorious' man pretended to be confused
and before he made up his mind to go his
opponent was far in the lead and won out.
The referee promptly declared that Gib
son had lost, and in spite of the mer
chant's spirited protest Stakeholder
Southwell gave the $1000 to the other man..
The men came to town and are having
a good time, while Bistorious is seeking
some way to reach them by law as he
declares the- fake was too apparent. .

SANTA CRUZ. July 12.â This has been a

visiting comrades, yet we cannot but rejoice
that at the head of our Government there Is a
comrade of our arms, tried and true; and. at
the time &i the appointment and confirmation
of another comrade in arms, Hon. H. Clay
, Evans, to the head of the Bureau of Pensions,
we. In common with all the veterans of the
United States, believed that we had further and
! additional cause to rejoice;
"Whereas, The said Bureau of Pensions has
' more intimately to do with the old soldier,
and especially the old soldier battle-scarred in
defense of his country, or disabled by the hand
of time, than any other department of the Gov
ernment, and as a consequence upon the ap
pointment to the control of that bureau one
who should know and appreciate the hardships
undergone, the sufferings endured and the needs
of the old soldier, we believed we had as such
i bureau head one who would, while exactly and
' Impartially administering his department, sym
pathize with and enter Into the feelings and
â  conditions of the veterans; and .
Whereas We have been grievously disap-
I pointed In 'such head of such bureau, occasioned
by his unjust; unfair and unfriendly treatment
Of the veterans who have been compelled to
! come in contact with his office; and
Whereas. The said head of said bureau has
by inconsiderate and harsh rules, by per
versions of the laws, as shown by the resolu
tions of the national Grand Army of the Re
public encampment. September 2S, 1898. by un
necessary delays in administration as to the
claims of the sick, disabled and needy old Mi
dlers their widows and children, by prescrib
ing rules and methods onerous and unneces
sary and by a course of conduct tending to
annoy, harass and vex applicants to his bureau
I without the betterment of the service, and has
by every means In his power shown himself out
of touch and without sympathy for and un
appreelative of the old soldiers, and himself to
he an autocrat; he It .
Resolved That we. the old soldiers aforesaid.
In meeting assembled, desire to and hereby ex
-1 press our strongest condemnation of the course
pursued by said Hon. H. Clay Evans, as head
of sad bureau, and respectfully petition the
pr-esldent to. remove him from a position of
which he has no appreciation, and ln which he
neither honors the country, the veterans nor
the administration. -
Resolved. That a copy hereof be forwarded
to the President and the same be published In
the press.
The programme which followed was in
' charge of and given by Los Gatos talent.
It opened with all singing "Tenting on the

SLIDING ICE
City of Topeka's Narrow
Escape While Passing
Muir Glacier.
AVALANCIIEDESCENDS
â * â
Immense Wave Caused by the Slide
Threatens the Vessel With
destruction..
. TACOMA,- July Juneau advices
received to-day contain a thrilling ac
count of a narrow escape from destruc
tion "---the steamship City of Topeka
and all her passengers on the last trip
Ito Alaska. For some reason, probably
i to avoid frightening prospective tour
[ ists, the steamship's officers and others
who were aboard the Topeka have re
! framed from making public the details.^
The Topeka was close to the face of*
j Muir glacier, when suddenly and with
â  ' out any warning an immense mountain
J of ice broke off from the glacier's face
; and tumbled into the bay. Thousands
of tons of white and blue ice were con
; tamed in this vast mass. The splash
was so tremendous that it seemed as if
i half the glacier had fallen. To make
i the occurrence still more startling, this
j vast iceberg was set in motion by its
fall and floated in a straight line to
ward the Topeka and her 200 passen
gers. Faces whitened and hearts beat
fast at the sight of what appeared to
be an approaching catastrophe. It was
instantly realized that the ship would
I be wrecked and probably sunk if the
: iceberg hit her. Still another element
i of danger was presented by the on
i rushing of the . tidal wave, caused by
the tremendous splash.
The Topeka's captain had signaled
for full steam ahead almost before the
iceberg broke. The big excursion
steamer was got under way so
quickly that she got away from both
wave and iceberg before they reached
| her. This was accomplished not a mo
ment too soon, for the Immense swell
broke over the Topeka's stern, causing
every one aboard to rush to the center
! and forward parts of her deck. One of
; the Topeka's officers is quoted in tl_e
' Juneau Mining Record as having said:
"I have faced danger in many forms,
I but none that for suddenness and ap
palling possibilities surpassed, this. If
that wave had struck us fairly the In
dians would be telling this tale, and
not I."
Some of the passengers did not realize
their great danger and were inclined
to treat the matter in a Joking light, but
the gravity of the situation became ap
parent when they saw the white and
serious faces of the ship's officers. A
peculiar and weird feature of the occur
rence is the fact that the Topeka's
whistle was blown loudly just as the
I glacier broke, and it seemed as if the
j echo had caused the breaking of the ice
mass. Hereafter none of the steamers
of the Pacific Coast Steamship Com
pany will be allowed to approach so
near to the face of Muir glacier.

RANKS OF VOLUNTEERS
TERRIBLY THINNED
MANILA, July 11.â The volunteers are
greatly debilitated in consequence of their
hard campaigning through three months
of tropic weather. Since the middle of
May no volunteer regiment has had a
sick list of less than 20 per cent- Most
of them at the present date have 25 per
cent ill, and a few regiments have less
than one-third of their number on duty.
The Nebraska Regiment has suffered
the worst. It came in from San Fernando
a few days ago with less than two hun
dred men in the ranks. Some of its com
panies has only two sets of fours. The
South Dakota followed yesterday with
275 men on duty. The Montana and Kan
sas regiments at San Fernando have not
more than 2SO available men each. The
morning after the Washington troops
took Morong, a week ago, only 263 men
responded to roll call.
The Washington men have been engaged
since March 12 in preventing the in:ur
gent armies of the north and south from
forming a junction in the region of La
cuna de Bal, often being engaged at the
same time with the enemy in opposite
directions. Twenty-four of the Nebraska
officers are on the sick list, and the Mon
tana Kansas, Washington and South Da
kota regiments show twenty or more of
ficers in the hospitals or sick in their
quarter* These regiments have borne the
blunt of the fighting. Their losses in
killed and wounded range from 160 in the
Montana regiment to 2SO Nebraska men.
The loss of the Kansas regiment is sec
ond to that of Nebraska. The Washing
ton and South Dakota men follow close
ly each with losses of about 200. The
Oregon regiment also suffered severely.
Of the regulars the Third Artillery is thÂ©
heaviest loser, its â¢ killed and wounded
numbering 123.

LOS ANGELES. July 12.â The last ot
the specials from the East bringing
delegates to the Rational Educa
tional Association Convention ar
rived this morning and the full
quota of visitors is now on hand.
The incident of the day in National Ed
ucational Association circles was the sud
den resignation of I. C. McNeill of West
Superior, Wis., who has been active treas
urer for six years. McNeill neither de-
Fired a renomination nor to remain In of
fice.
The nominating committee, before which
is placed the names of all candidates, mcl
at a late hour this afternoon. The follow
ing comprise the Western division: Mon
tana, J. P. Hendricks; Wyoming, Miss
Estella Reel; Colorado, Aaron Gove; New
Mexico, C. M. Light; Arizona, F. X.
Cooler; Utah. J. M. Tanner; Nevada,
Thomas F. Brown; Idaho. Miss Dorris
McMasters: Washington, R. S. Bingham;
Oregon, Frank Rigler; California, J. W.
MeClemonds.
As- stated in these dispatches, a dignified
campaign was waged for the office of
president. When the names of Foshay,
Brown and Webster of California wore
presented these candidates were with
drawn as a graceful compliment to the
other candidates, as the convention this
year was being held in the Golden State.
This left the contest between Professor
Jordon of Minneapolis, L. D. Harvey cf
Wisconsin and O. T. Corson, ex-School
Commissioner of Ohio. The reports of
the geographical sections were favorable
to Corson, which again shows it is a good
thing to come from Ohio. The committee
will report Corson's name to the conven
tion to-morrow for balloting, and as that
body seldom disregards the report of the
committee it can be taken for granted
that the Buckeye man will be the Na
tional Educational Association president
for 19-1900.
McNeill's resignation forced the filling
of that office. The friends of Professor
L. C. Greenlee of Denver and those of C.
G. Pearse of Omaha labored diligently
for a few hours. The committee will rec
cii'.menJ Pearse of Omaha.
The question where the next convention
shall be held will to-morrow be decided.
The contest has narrowed down to
Charleston and Montreal. Cincinnati will
not make a bid for the honor, as that
State has secured the presidency in Cor
son. It is said to-night that the 100 boom
ers from Cincinnati held the convention
city card up fhelr sleeves to play against
the field for the presidency. Charleston
is still In the lead, and unless unfore
seen contingencies appear will carry off
the prize.
When President E. O. Lyte called to
order the general session of the National
Educational Convention this morning
there sat before him such an audience as
Was seen but once before in this city. The
crowd in Hazards' Pavilion was not as
great as the one that packed the Audi
torium yesterday afternoon. The fact
that the programme to-day was of a more
technical character had much to do with
reducing the size of the audience, though
the pleasant weather and the innumera
ble counter attractions hereabouts had
something to do with it. The audience
was composed principally of women, their
bright "flower garden" hats and pretty
summer gowns throwing completely Into
the shade the delegates of the sterner sex.
It was an intellectual audience. It was
attentive, appreciative and. needless to
say, more decorous. The bright faces and
pretty creations of art of milliners and
modistes seemed suited to the aesthetic
environments of the decorations that had
transformed the great Auditorium into a
bower of beauty. The addresses were lis
tened to with attention, the auditors
seemingly being determined to absorb all
th'j Instructive thoughts that were uttered
by the authors of the papers.
"Fundamentals In Teaching" was the
subject of a paper by L. D. Harvey, Su
perintendent of Public Instruction for
Wisconsin. Mr. Harvey said:
The following Is suggested as furnishing a
basis for the development of the method of de
termining what is to be done for and in any
given recitation.
The teacher must have in mind a definite
purpose or purposes to be realized in the next
recitation.
2â The teacher must have in mind the things
which must be known or done in order that
the purposes may be realized.
3 The teacher must determine what of the
things falling under No. 2 the pupil now knows
or can now do.
4 â He must determine what of the things
enumerated in No. 2 the pupil still has to learn
or to do. and the order In which they should
be known or done.
When these four things have been deter
mined the teacher Is ready to consider the
question of how these things shall be taught
or learned, and until these four things are
determined any consideration of the how is
a putting of the cart before the horse. Other
things being equal, the best teaching Is al
ways done when this order of procedure is fol
lowed by the teacher, either consciously or un
consciously, perhaps best when unconsciously
followed.
Mrs. Helen Grenfell, State Superinten
dent of Public Instruction of Colorado,
delivered an. address entitled "Quo Vadi
mus." She said in part:
Some parents have believed that the educat
ing or failing to educate their children was
a matter for their sole decision, but the con
ception of the state seems to me that the child
does not exist entirely for the parents' good,
but for the good of all. Compulsory education
is apparently an infringement of parents'
rights, although certainly a necessity at pres
ent. â¢
"The Average Scholarship of the Aver
ago Pupil," was the topic of a paper
read by Professor Frank Rlgler, Super
intendent of Schools at Portland, Ore.
The sneaker drew attention to the neces
sity for arranging the course of study
to suit the peculiar needs of each child.
He said that under the present system
each child was expected to do as much
as his fellow student and that his spe
cial ability along any one line did not re
ceive sufficient recognition. A system
whereby the child could have one class
teacher, but at the same time be allowed
to take studies in other grades, for which
his ability fitted him, was advocated.
A brief talk by Professor J. H. Hine
mon of Pine Bluff. Ark., who represented
the Southern Educational Association,
was listened to with interest. He said
in part:
More than thirty years ago a little less, than
4,000,000 of slaves in the South were suddenly
emancipated, and shortly thereafter they were
endowed with all the rights of American citi
zenship. This imposed on the whites of the
South the gravest problem that has ever con
fronted the Anglo-Saxon race. Right heroi
cally aid the Southern whites set themselves to

BRILLIANT ADDRESSES BY MEN AND
WOMEN OF LEARNING,
that have followed they have been slowly but
surely and steadily solving the peculiar and
perplexing question of equitable adjustment of
rights, property and education or two races
which had so long associated together as slave
and master, but which now stand with equal
rights an.) powers under the laws of the land.
In working out these difficulties we have felt
that we had the earnest sympathy of the edu
cational leaders of the other sections of our
country.
Professor W. S. Morse of the State
Normal School at Winfield, Mass., fol
lowed with an address on "Fatigue
Among Children." Said he:
Under the strains and exhausting callings
of modern civilized life the power of endurance
is continually rising in Importance, and. ac
cording to Sir Francis Galton. men and women
have nowadays to act rapidly for many hours
and to act exceptionally well. It seems, there
fore, reasonable that teachers should direct
their attention to some proper way of deter
mining the power of endurance among school
children. Educators are beginning to feel a
measure of their responsibility in ascertaining
the causes which condition mental fatigue.
During the past twenty years no subject ln
pedagogy has been more carefully studied than
that of school fatigue, and the problem Is not
to eliminate normal fatigue hut to prevent ex
treme forms of exhaustion, for It is the latter
which is so detrimental to efficient mental
work.
The paper that aroused the widest com
ment at the evening session of the con
vention was the one read by Professor
Elmer E. Brown. University of Califor
nia, upon the subject of "Art in Educa
tion." Professor Brown said a "culti
vated'! person was one who- is not only
learned, but whose learning was touched
with a certain fineness of quality which
rendered it peculiarly significant and hu
man. In the sense of the beautiful, and
whatever gave it strength and clearness,
there was a subtle and pervasive sort of
culture which went with its possessor
wherever he might go; It pervaded and
invigorated and vitalized a man's
thought. He continued:
There has been a marked tendency In recent
thought to get nearer to the heart of moral
character: to Judge It somewhat less by out
ward and conventional signs. At the same time
our painters and sculptors have been showing
us the beauty hidden in the common things of
nature and human life. We have learned to
turn away from pink Venuses and pretty
Cupids to find a deeper pleasure in studies of
sand dunes and fishermen and laborers In the
field. So our ideas of beauty and of righteous
ness, by getting deeper, are getting rearer to-
ether. These are changes of vast significance
In the history of human culture. We are
slowly working toward a true appreciation of
the "beauty of holiness," and this. I take it.
Is the ultimate object of all esthetic culture.
GIVING SHAPE TO
THE YOUNG IDEA
Suggestions Offered by Per
sons Experienced in Kin-
dergarte'n Work.
LOS ANGELES, July 12.â Mrs. Marie
Kraus-Boelte of New York City presided
in the kindergarten department to-day,
and Dr. N. Murray Butler presented a
paper which attracted especial attention.
He applied himself to an examination of
some of the failings of kindergarten
methods, pointing out some of the weak
nesses of them and offering suggestions
for remedying the defects. Dr. Butler's
paper was entitled "Some Criticisms of
the Kindergarten."
"It is possible to have too much* for
little hands," said he. "Young minds
must be nurtured and developed. Noth
ing is harmful when tempered with jus
tice, but overcrowding, overdoing and
overworking may form conditions that
can later form well-springs of evil."
"Character Study in the Kindergarten,"
was the topic discussed by Thomas P.
Bailey of the University of California,
Said he:
We are able to understand the kindergarten
child only on the supposition that he Is not a
strange species, but a human animal like unto
the rest of us, neither an angel nor a beast.
We do not care to discuss either the angelio
kindergarten or the neuromuscular kinder
garten. The little child Is neither a bundle of
habits nor a mystic dreamer about eternity
and Infinity. If we want to compare him with
the savage, let the comparison be- with the
child savage, not the adult; with the healthy
and developing rather than with the degener
ate.
What are the generic traits of character we
need to develop, nurture and train ln this young
human animal? The habits ought to be trained;
the instincts ought to be nurtured; the talents
ought to be developed. The most generic hab
its are the psychical, the sympathetic and the
self-assertive. Individual differences will in
large measure determine the amount of stress
to be laid on one rather than another habitude.
But the tendency in the average kindergarten Is
to emphasize some one of the habitudes, and
to neglect the others. Even when all are
trained they are often not organically related.
If the kindergarten Is to become indispensable
to the community, it must base Its practice
upon a comprehensive science of character.
"In What Relation Stands Imitation to
Originality and Consequent Freedom,"
was answered by Miss Mary F. Ledyard,
Supervisor of Kindergartens of Los An
geles. She said:
Our civilization of to-day Is but a product of
all that has gone before. The few great men
who have through Imitation first caught the
spirit of the achievements of the past and
assimilated them to such a degree that they
could build thereon fine new adjustments and
bring forth products that open new windows,
letting in floods of light upon the world. Such
are freed men.
THE HIGH SCHOOL
AND ITS MISSION
Puts the Pupil Into Full Posses
sion of His Executive
Powers.
. LOS ANGELES, July 12.â suggestive
paper on "the subject, "Do Our High
Schools Prepare for College and for Life
THE SAN FB AN CISCO CALL,, THURSDAY, JULY 13, 1899.
in Accordance "With the Requirements of
Both?" was read by G. B. Morrison, prin
cipal of the Manual Training High School
of Kansas City, in the department of
secondary education. He enunciated it as
an axiomatic truth that the objects of life
were happiness, contentment and useful
ness to others, and that education con
sisted of thought and its expression. He
ventured to say that the high schools
failed to prepare for life to the extent
that they treat language as anything
else than a vehicle for thought, drawing
as anything hut a sort of universal lan
guage and mathematics as other than a
device for measuring quantity. In the
opinion of the speaker the thought side
in the schools should be strengthened by
using fewer books and more laboratories;
the expression side by the constant prac
tice of portraying dally experiences by
words, drawings and figures. In brief,
schools would be Improved if they taught
more labor and less discussion of the
question of labor. As It was the tendency
of much of the training Is toward non
productiveness, caste, militarism, social
ism, politics and laziness.
Professor E. P. Cubberly, Stanford Uni
versity, led the discussion that followed
the reading of the paper, and then J. W.
Crabtree, inspector of accredited schools
for the University of Nebraska, dealt
with the subject, - "Should Arithmetic,
English Grammar, History and Geog
raphy be Reviewed in the High School?"
He said a half year of good, thorough
work on these branches in the twelfth
year was worth two years on the same
at the beginning of the high school.
Whether the question was viewed from
the university or high school standpoint,
the answer must be the same. Whether
the student was to continue in school or
stop out, no school work was more valu
able to him than a knowledge of theso
common-school branches. It did not mat
ter whether the review is bunched at the
last end of the course or extended through
the year, occupying one hour a day. It
was Important to give the review. No
work in the high school was of more prac
tical value or of more culture value

said, "Ev'ry hoss c'n do a thing better 'n

In discussion that followed Miss Eda
Parrish, supervisor of drawing of San
Bernardino, took' the most prominent part.
Said she:
I believe there Is danger ln giving too many
incidental statements about pictures, of thrust
ing the picture between the child and nature.
The child should look at pictures and study
nature. The child should be led to look at pic
tures studiously, earnestly, honestly, but the
fact should be constantly emphasized that pic
tures, books, theories, will not give him a prac
tical knowledge of art, but If he would thor
oughly know art he must study It in the orig
inal tongue, and not through Interpreters.

"Anthropometric Studies in Nebraska"
was the subject of a paper by W. TV.
Hastings of Lincoln, Nebr. Twenty-fivo
hundred children have been examined at
Lincoln and 10.000 at Omaha. Fifteen dif
ferent physical qualities were taken by
observers; the same number of accessory
items as to nationality, occupation, dis
eases, etc., were elicited by question
blanks sent to parents. The calculated re
sults compare favorably with those ob
tained at Boston by Dr. Bowditch, at St.
Louis by- Dr. Porter, with those of Rob
erts and of Quetelet. They were given by
Professor Hastings as follows:
1. Nebraska children take a medium place as
regards weight; they are superior to any others
in height.
2. Children of American parentage are pre
vailingly superior to foreigners.
3. Girls are heavier and taller than boys dur
ing the thirteenth and fourteenth years. Dur
ing the twelfth and fifteenth years also they
exceed boys in height but not in weight.
4. The physical basis of mental efficiency Is
clearly demonstrated by the fact that the
height, weight and other physical qualities
of children of the same age correspond to
school grades.. .;

D. C, delivered an able address, dealing
with matters of special interest. G. W.
Brown, president of Brown's Business
College at Jacksonville, 111., went at some
length into a consideration of "Schooling
versus Education." The speaker was
able to distinguish a decided difference
between schooling and education. His

phases of practical education not touched
on by previous papers.
J. M. Meban occupied a few minutes in
directing the thoughts of the assembled
teachers to the matter of "An. Adequate
Course of Study for Business Colleges."
This paper was deliberated upon by sev
eral of the educators, A. V. Felght of the
Oakland Polytechnic Business College
leading the discussion.
"How I Conduct a Business School" was
the subject of a paper by C. E. Howard,
president of the San Francisco Business
College.- Said he:
Our students begin with business community,
or actual business at once, as I believe the way
to teach a boy to do a thing Is to teach him to
do It. not to study about It.
Each student receives a â¢ capital of $5000 and
deposits it in the college bank, ' and at once
enters upon a course of transactions - with
other students. Every transaction la real and
has two actual parties. In this way the Indi
viduality of every student is brought out. and
each account in the books becomes an actual.
living reality to him.
Each student Is furnished with a carefully
graded outline of transactions, containing all
the principles of accounts. He actually per
forms each transaction, and then records the
results of that transaction in his books. Thus
he never loses sight of the connection between
the transaction and the entry, and Is able to
see the reason for every entry. The outline is
so graded that the student passes step by step
from the simple to the complex â the
known to the unknown. This grading is a most
important element In the success of any plain
teaching.
CHICAGO TEACHERS
WITH A MISSION
Will Attempt to Organize a
National Federation of
Instructors.
LOS ANGELES, July 12.â Chicago
Teachers' Federation and the Chicago
Teachers' Club, numbering 200, announced
their arrival in Los Angeles in that char
acteristic and energetic style that has.
made â¢ the Windy City famous. These
women come with an object. They are
imbued with an ambition and their slo
gan is:

Are we In It?
I should smile.

A good long while.
Go, go, go.
But don't go slow,
We are the people
From Chi-caw-go.
That tells the whole story- These women
are the advance guard of a new organi- -
zation that will to-morrow spring into
being. The travel-stained pedagogues
were taken in hand shortly after 6:30 this
morning by the fruit, flower and reception
committee and .were given a royal wel
come by the branch of their federation in
Los Angeles. The party was much dis
concerted when told that its living apart
ments had been given to the New Yorkers,
but Miss Catherine Goggin, the president,
gave thanks that the splendidly appointed
headquarters had not been confiscated,
and Miss Helen B. Eastman, the corre
sponding secretary, procured the register
and ink pot and amid the copfusion and
bubble of scores of female voices compla
cently proceeded to business. This was
confined to sending out hundreds of Invi
tations to prominent educators that are in
attendance upon the convention.
These invitations recite that the federa
tion has had practical illustration in Chi
cago of the bejiefits derived from organi
zation among teachers and they hope that
the recipient will respond, that a national
organization of teachers may be one of
the results of this year's National Educa
tional Association meeting. This meeting
will be held to-morrow afternoon in the
federation's headquarters. The federation,
unfortunately, was delayed twenty-four
hours and that destroyed the value of its
programme. The leaders come imbued
with- the intention of presenting a peti

they become one of the departments. The
leaders to-night say that they will organ

touched upon by the previous speaker. A
brief general discussion followed.
- "The Educational Value of Metal Work
ing" was the subject of a paper presented
by Principal Vinton A. Paesseler of the
Barlow School of Industry. He spoke as
follows: :;'-.;
Skill and art in metal working has always
been so necessary to human existence that it
is imrjossible to discover when the metallic
thread befcan to be woven Into the web of
progress. " -,'
History credits metal working with ' having
the first recorded teacher, and the invention of
the process of smelting Iron ore as being the
beginning of civilization. Our condition with
out the use of metal would be most pitiable.
The Industry of the world would i perish for
lack of tools with which to do the work. The
wheels of progress would cease to turn. The
school house would fail. â  The telegraph and
cable and steamboat would be unknown. The
microscope and telescopic worlds would be
hidden from us.

AUTOMOBILE TO START
WESTWARD TO-DAY
FOB THE RUN ACROSS CONTINENT
A telegram received
by The Call yesterday
announced that the
start in the attempt
to cross the continent
from New York to San
Francisco in an auto
mobile will be made
from the New York
Herald building at II
o'clock this morning.
The dispatch states
further that owners of
motor carriages in
New York are invited
to be present in their
vehicles and to act as
escortup Fiftnavenue
and out of New York
on the road to Albany.
NEW YORK, July 12.â Mr. and
Mrs. John D. Davis, who have
planned to be the first auto
mobilists to make the run from
this city to the Pacific Coast,
called at the Herald building in their
touring cart to-day and announced
that they- were ready to start on their
long journey. Their carriage had just
been completed by the National Motor
Company, and has been made
especially strong to enable it to with
stand the shaking up it is bound to get
on the roads between here and San
Francifcco. The distance by' the short
est railroad is 3250 miles, and by the
wagon roads which Mr. Davis will use
close to 3700 lies will have to be cov
ered.
In France, where automobilism is
claimed to have made greater advances
than in this country, the longest run
recorded is 1000 kilometers or 621 miles,
and French roads are equal to the best
parkways in the United States.
Bicyclists have made runs from the
Atlantic to the Pacific coasts, but have
followed the railroad tracks through
the mountains. An automobile must
take the old stage routes from Denver
west, and difficulties will be encoun
tered in the Rocky Mountains and be
yond that would appall the average
tourist.
Mr. Davis is determined to get
through, no matter how rough the road
or how steep the grades he finds in the
West. He Bays he will drive the auto
mobile through or over every obstacle
and land it in front of the San Fran
cisco Call building.
A run even from New York to
Chicago Is not without its difficulties.
There are hills to climb and roads to
pas?, that are deep in sand, while
others are made of clay that turns to
mud at the slightest fall of rain.
Starting, as he does, with a motor fresh
from the factory and without the time
for thorough testing, it will not be at
all surprising if Mr. Davis has break
downs on the road.

START ACROSS â¢
THE CONTINENT
Mr. and Mrs. John D. Davis will
leave in their automobile at 11
o'clock this morning from Herald
square. New York, for The Call
building, San Francisco.
Mrs. Davis, who has pluckily decided
to accompany her husband, is an at
tractive young woman, who has never
laid eyes on bounding prairies. She
comes from New Haven, Conn. Mr.
Davis hats spent several years on the
plains, and is more or less familiar
with the country between Denver and
San Francisco. Their automobile is a
handsome affair, and while It bears a
strong resemblance to the road phae
ton, one may see at a glance that It
was not built for horse propulsion. The
wheels are of the bicyclist type with
steel spokes and pneumatic tires. The
back is built high for comfort and well
cushioned, and a buggy top, which may
be lowered at will, covers the vehicle.
The driver sits on the left side, with
his right hand on a nickel-plated steer
ing lever. Two shorter levers are with
in reach of his left hand. These con
trol the speed gears, one of them, mov
ed forward, gives a speed up to ten
miles and when moved backward
throws in the reverse gear, which is
for backing, and also acts as a brake.
The second lever is used for the inter
mediate gear when in a forward, posi
tion, and when to the back it throws
in the high gear which gives a speed
up to thirty-five miles an hour. The
gasoline motor is concealed in a box
beneath the seat. Except for levers
for guilding and regulating the speed,
and the belt box that extends to rear
axle, no signs of mechanism are visible.
Mr. Davis made the run in the auto
moble from Stamford. : Connecticut,
where it was built, to this city without
accident. When the vehicle arrived in
Herald Square it attracted crowds. Mr.
Davis was accompanied by his wife,
and the two were at once recognized as
the long-distance voyagers. Mr. Davis
moved the automobile forward and
backward through the crowd* and in
and out among electric cars, trucks
and delivery wagons with ease. It
seemed to be under perfect control. Mr.
Davis was obliged to ring his bell re
peatedly and to slow up frequently to
prevent running down small boys who
persisted in getting in front of the ma
chine. Horses in the city paid little
attention to the odd-looking vehicle,
but Mr. Davis said that on his way
from Stamford teams of country horses
showed signs of fright as he passed
them. Mr. Davis said that he expected
to lose considerable time on the jour
ney by slowing down and stopping to
avoid causing runaways.
Half a dozen automobiles of differ
ent styles of manufacture are expected
to rendezvous to-morrow (Thursday)
in Herald Square shortly before 11
o'clock to see the strrt. Mr. Davis will
have the right of way with his car
riage. The route will be through
Thirty-fifth street to Fifth avenue, up
Fifth avenue to One Hundred and Six
teenth street, west to Seventh avenue
and north to Central Bridge.
Only a moderate speed will be made
within the city limits. The owners of
escorting vehicles may drop out at
Central Park or may continue on to
the Harlem River or farther. Mr. Da
vis will take. Sedgewick avenue to
Kings Bridge, where he will turn to the
left, crossing the tracks of the New
York Central and New York and Put
nam roads to Broadway, which will give
him a good road to Yonkers.
The route to Albany will closely fol
low the east bank of the Hudson River.
From Albany the road runs west
through the Mohawk Valley, passing
through Utlca, Syracuse and Roches
ter. At- Buffalo the route turns south
and leads along the shore of Lake Erie,
through Cleveland and Toledo, and
across Indiana to South Bend and
thence to Chicago.
The route from Chicago to the Pacific
Coast lies through Dcs Moines. Omaha.
Denver, Ogden and Sacramento. Mr.
Davis has studied the good roads maps
of .the League of American Wheelmen
and other available Information bear
ing upon the- roads through States
which he must cross. He planned his
route with. care. He will collect, data
as to the condition of roads and grades
he has to climb and descend, and other
matters of interest to automobilists.
cyclists and persons who favor the bet
terment of American roads.
It is Mr. Davis' plan after the first
day to make early morning starts, rest
in the middle of the day, and run again
late in the afternoon and in the early
evening. He aims to put in ten hours
a day on the road, and expects to make
an average of fifteen miles an hour.
Daily bulletins of the runs made will
be printed in the Herald and The Call.
Mr. and Mrs. Davis were naturally
impatient at the delay caused by the
manufacturers' failure to complete the
motor cairiage at the stipulated time.

especially to the feminine readers of
The Call, to see a list of the articles
the automobllists will take with them,
and this was best learned from Mrs.
Davis herself, when seen at her reslÂ»
dence in Madison avenue to-night. She
said to The Call correspondent:
"It will not take long to tell The Call's
readers what we will take with us. I
wanted to take a dress suit case so I
could at least have an evening gown
upon arrival in San Francisco, but Mr.
Davis could only allow room for one
small trunk, which will be strapped on
behind the automobile like baggage on
old-fashioned stage coaches. It is a
'boot,' I think, is it not, or is the rub
ber curtain that reaches up to your
chin to keep the rain out of the buggy
i called a 'boot'? Anyhow, we are to
have one of the litter also. I fancy it
will be snug in the automobile when *t
rains; our trunk behind will be covered
with a water -proof tarpaulin. I am so
sorry I cannot take an evening gown
with me, not because I expect San
Francisco people will make social lions
of us and give us receptions and all
that, for honestly we hope they will
not. I dread any spectacular demon
stration, and sincerely hope that when
we start from the Herald building to
morrow morning there will be no big
crowd and no 'hurrah.' I am told,
though, that some enthusiastic auto
mobllists will escort us through New-
York streets to the Harlem River. My,
If I just had a reception gown to wear
in San Francisco, for I know I will look
shabby after such a long trip! I am
going to take only a street dress be
sides the one I shall wear on the trip.
My traveling dress will be of military
blue, with skirts reaching to my tan
shoe tops. My hat will be a broad
brimmed felt or 'sombrero' as you
would say out West. I will have a
quill in it, that is the fashion now, you
know, and it is no conceit of mine to
look like an Indian squaw. Besides the
garments named I shall take two or
three shirt waists and some other ap
parel. Goodness knows how or when I
will have them laundered, for, you
know, we will travel all day and ex
pect to sleep at night at the towns we
happen to strike at nightfall. But
doubtless I can manage to have some
washing done. We will, of course, take
a medicine chest with us, filled with
arnica, extract, salve, quinine, alcohol
and various kinds of pellets needless
to mention, and some glycerine and
cold cream. Yes, a lot of cold cream,
for I Just know I shall look a fright
when we get to San Francisco. We
will have to cross that horrid old
American desert, and I have heard that
the alkali makes your skin as harsh
and dry as parchment. I will use cold
cream and glycerine for that and am
monia to soften water for my hair.
"Would you believe that we have re
ceived hundreds of letters from all sorts
of enterprising patent medicine venders
offering to supply us with everything
from pills to dollars in consideration of
the free advertising we might be able
to give them? We have been offered no
end of good things by New York mer
chants, too, who are anxious to get
their names in print. I wish to goodness
some enterprising fur house would of
fer me a sealskin wrap to wear over the
summits c-f the Rocky and Sierra Ne
vada mountains. Say, really, now, is
it true that at Truckee we shall have
to plow through snow ten or twenty
feet deep? How ever shall we do it?
I am told, too, that often we shall have
to travel perhaps a whole day without
ever a sight of a habitation. Is It so?
We shall, of course, have some bottled
water to drink and enough to eat, but
Just think of traveling all day through
an alkali desert. But there Is one good
thing, it is level ground in these deserts
and our machine can then speed thirty
five miles an hour. By riding ten hours
a day we ought to get through the
worst part in a few days. Of course,
the mountain passes will be hard to
climb.
"Our machine only weighs 1250 pounds
with both of us in it, and can be light

Just fancy our pushing the thing up
the mountain canyons. Say, now,
really, do you think we will be able to
make it? Mr. Davis says, 'Yes, of
course, we will; we will get there If it
takes all summer,' though he really
expects to get through in forty-five
days. We have received a lot of dis
couraging letters from all parts of the
country. Some say we are a pair of
venturesome young fools to attempt
such a journey, but these letters only

make us all the more determined to get
through. We have just got to do it,
that's all. We have received some en
couraging letters, also, but one of the
most comfort to us was from an old
forty-niner who now lives in Brooklyn.
He called to see us and wanted to go
along and show us the trail he crossed
fifty years ago, and was so anxious to
accompany us. What a pity we had
no seat for him, besides what could we
do with an old man 80 years old?
Wouldn't it be romantic, though, to
ride with us in the new-fangled ma
chine, a poor old forty-niner who cross
ed in an ox team half a century ago. I
am afraid I'm sentimental; it almost
makes me cry to think how hard that
old man pleaded to go with us.
"Well, good-by. Tell The Call we are
grateful for its encouragement, but ex
pect to thank Its editors personally for
the interest they have taken in our en
terprise."
Mr. Davis says that In coming down
to New York from Stamford, Conn., the
machine behaved beautifully and its
performance exceeded his expectation,
both as to power and facility- of ..ma
nipulation. He says Eastern automo
bile factories have more orders than
they can fill are working day and
night, and orders pile up faster than
they can turn out carriages. Bonuses
are being paid for carriages and intend
ing purchasers are" using every means
to hasten completion of their automo
biles.
The transcontinental touring cart was
delayed in completion, owing to the
fact that there was no pattern for a car
riage of this class. It was necessary
to have a vehicle of such strength and
build as to withstand all sorts of
weather.
GREAT INTEREST
AROUSED IN WEST
OMAHA, July 12.â The proposition of
the Herald and the San Francisco Call
to send an automobile across the con
tinent has provoked extraordinary in
terest through this section of the west,
and not a little curiosity among many
people in the interior of Nebraska, who
never saw such a machine and have
very vague ideas as to what it looks
like.
From the day the first announcement
of the plan was made the daily papers
of this section have been full of in
quiries from persons in various sec
tions of the State as to what . route
would be taken from Omaha west, the
time of arrival of the automobile at
the Missouri River, and the possible
rate of speed the machine .would" travel
in passing through the State,
When the flier arrives at the Missouri
River a very elaborate reception will
be tendered those aboard. The two
cities of Omaha and Council Bluffs will
unite to greet the visitors. The World-
Herald has arranged for a brass band
to meet them at Council Bluffs and es
cort them across the Missouri River,
where an informal banquet will be
served, provided their time will permit
of anything of the kind. From Omaha
it is supposed the machine will be
driven over the famous overland trail
and the most feasible route from the
Missouri River to Denver. This means
that the route will be practically with
the Union Pacific Railroad all the way
across the State and into Denver. That
will carry the machine over one of the
prettiest race courses in the world for
a distance of over 300 miles, or until
the sands of Western .Nebraska and
Eastern Colorado are encountered.
Passing out of Omaha, the route will
be over a slightly hilly but perfectly
fine driving road for a distance of
thirty miles. This will carry the auto
mobile out of the hills and upon the fine
table land that stretches practlcally
across the State. From Fremont, Neb.,
to North Platte, a distance of 200 miles,
the road will be as level and firm as the
packed black soil can make it. From the
Colorado eastern line the automobile is
liable to encounter some rough'travel
ing, as compared to the Nebraska
roads. If plenty of rain has fallen a
few days prior to the trip the ground
will be found well caked with sand. If
no rain has fallen for several weeks
about six inches of sand will close over
the wheels of the machine the entire
distance of 200 miles to Denver. This
sand is white and full of grit and al
most as light as prairie dust.
Across the State of lowa the machine
ought to make excellent time. If any
thing, the roads in lowa at this time of
the" year are better than in Nebraska,
and that means an. ideal condition for
outdoor traveling. One hundred miles a
day could easily be made across that
State, if it is desired to drive the ma
chine to its full speed capacity.
THE VAST DEMAND
FOR AUTOMOBILES
NEW YORK, July 12.â Isaac L. Rice,
president of the Electric Vehicle Com
pany, said to-day that he has placed
orders for automobiles amounting to
$8,000,000. The orders are for 4200 new

â * â
Idaho Authorities Having a Hard
Time to Connect Corcoran With
Cheyne's Murder.
â â
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WALLACE, Idaho, July 12.â During
the trial of the Corcoran case to-day
Judge Stewart ordered a witness con
fined in jail on a diet of bread and
water.
L. G. Johnson, a Scandinavian, was
called by the prosecution. Johnson has
been confined in i the "bull pen," and
was brought to Wallace to testify. As
soon as he came into court it was seen
he was very much excited. While be
ing sworn he attempted to address the
Judge in unintelligible English. Attor
ney Hawley undertook to interrogate
the witness, who did not answer. Haw
ley claimed the witness was able to un
derstand if he desired to. The court
then took' the witness in hand, but was
unable to elicit anything satisfactory
from him.
"Mr. Sheriff, take this man to Jail
and confine him upon bread and water
until such time as the court advises to
bring him back here," said the Judge.
Johnson's stolid countenance under
went not the slightest- change, and he
walked out accompanied by a deputy,
indifferent to, if he understood, the or
der.
The witnesses called by the State are
evidently proving unsatisfactory, for
its attorneys have already attempted
to impeach two of their own witnesses.
Save in the testimony of Clark, re
ferred to yesterday, no attempt has
been made to connect Corcoran with
the crime with which he is charged.
The evidence has been directed toward
proving the conspiracy, which the
prosecution claims resulted in the
death of Cheyne.
The witnesses to-day were all resi
dents of Wardner, and told how em
ployes of the Bunker Hill Company
had been stopped on their way to work
by union men on April 23. The inci
dents of the ttrike and the difficulties
existing ,at that * ; me between the com
pany and its employes were detailed,
and it was shown that men had been
threatened by armed strikers, who fol
lowed them to their boarding houses,
and there used considerable . violence.
During the following week matters
quieted down, and the non-union men
were allowed to return to their work
so that on the day of the riot the com
pany had nearly a full force.
â¢ Attorney Reddy severely criticised
what he termed the unfair and out
rageous attitude of the attorneys for
the. State in withholding from the de
fense the testimony given before the
Coroner's Jury. The law requires the
Coroner, to reduce to writing and file
with, the County Clerk the. testimony
taken before him. This has not been
done, and Attorney Forney stated that
the inquest had not been concluded.
Reddy denounced this statement as a
mere subterfuge and said the Coro
ner's jury had not been in session for
weeks and that the testimony was be
ing withheld for the purpose of ham
pering the defense and of convicting
the defendant without a fair trial. In
support of his assertion he stated that
the testimony was in the hands of the
attorneys for the State, who used it
whenever they desired to contradict
witnesses, but that the defense had no
access to it. The court refused to or
der the testimony filed, saying that it
was a matter entirely with the Coro
ner.
The story that masked men had vis
ited employes of the Standard Com
pany and threatened them with death
if they did not leave the country turns
out to be a hoax concocted by a Mis
sourian named Hudson, who success
fully imposed it upon a reporter. It
was denied by both the State authori
ties and miners from the first, and the
originator of it has now acknowledged
that it was not true.

Nicolaus Ranch Employe. Wounds a

MARYSVILLE, July 12.â At Nicolaus,
twelve miles south of here, to-day Fred
Griesler, employed on the ranch of G.
Splnden.-made a desperate but Ineffectual
attempt to kill Maggie Breitback, a 17
--year-old servant girl. Believing he had
accomplished his purpose he committed
suicide by blowing the top of his head off
with a shotgun he had used in his attack
on the young woman.
Griesler, who was considered. eccentric,
worked on farms in the vicinity of Nlcho
laus for three years. This morning he
frightened the girl away from the house
by his peculiar actions, and as she fled
across a field toward Nlcholaus he fired
four shots from - the shotgun, two of the
charges taking effect, one in her shoulder
and one In her back. The wounds are not
serious, as she managed to keep a safe dis
tance from her pursuer. The NlcolauS
officers hastened to the farm to arrest
Griesler and found that he had killed him

Â© SALINAS, July 12.â repor.t comes by telephone from San Lucas Â£
Â© that Bert Harris, the six-year-old son of B. A. Harris, a prominent Mon- Â©
$ terey County rancher, was burned alive at his home near that town,
i$ and that considerable mystery surrounds the little fellow's death. The g

GALLINGER AND
CHANDLER CLASH
Senators Almost Come
- to Blows.
â â
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CONCORD, N. H.. July 12.â The hear
ing in connection with charges of the
violation of the civil service against Sen
ator Jacob H. Gallinger, preferred by
former Governor Charles A. Busie' , was
continued to-day. Only two witnesses re
sponded to the invitation of the commis
sioners to be present at to-day's session.
They were Postmasters Henry Robinson
of Concord and H. A. Spauldlng of Nash
ua. Their testimony was to the effect
that campaign circulars asking for as
sessments for campaign purposes had
been sent out as alleged In the charges.
Before any witnesses were, heard Sen
ator Gallinger asked permission to make
a personal statement, in wuich he called
! attention to alleged untruthful state-
I ments made in the editorials of a Con-
cord paper and dispatches from Concord
to a New York paper.
The statements referred to by Senator
Gallinger were that the present charges
were based upon the finding of a letter
In Concord addressed to a man in Rye,
N. H., containing a check for $100 and
instructions to use the sum "circumspect
ly" among the indifferent voters of Rye.
It was also claimed that the cheek was
signed by Senator Gallinger. This the
Senator denied. The incident is not con
nected with this hearing and Senator
Gallinger's statement was not made a
part of the record.
Following- this the witnesses were
called. Postmaster Robinson stated that
he recelevd one of the assessment circu
lars. He produced the circular and gave
it to the commissioners, who filed it
away. This Incident caused considerable
surprise. -. .-.;'. , . ,
Mr. Robinson then said that he had
mentioned the fact of receiving the cir
cular to Senator Chandler, and upon the
advice of that -gentleman had sealed it
up and he had shown It to no one until
this time. He was asked to contribute
$10Â«, and he wrote to the Civil Service
Commission, asking them as to his ability
to contribute under the law. He was In
formed that he could not contribute. Cop
ies of the correspondence between Mr.
Robinson and the commission were in
troduced as part of the evidence, and Mr.
Robinson closed his testimony by stating
that he did not contribute.
Postmaster Spalding was chairman of
the Republican State Committee in 1896.
He stated that he received one of the
circulars on which the charges in this
case are based, but that he did not con
tribute. When chairman of the State
Committee, he said that he personally
signed the assessment circulars which
were sent out, but none were sent to
Federal office holders, except to Senators,
Congressmen and Judges of the Federal
courts. At the conclusion of Mr. Spald
ing's testimony a recess was taken.
The afternoon session brought out a
warm colloquy between Senators Gallin
ger and Chandler. Before the adjourn
ment was taken they had passed the lie
and Senator Chandler and Commissioner
: Brewer had become involved in a dispute
I which the Senator says will lead him to
ask President McKinley for the removal
of Mr. Brewer from the Civil Service
Commission. No early witnesses were on
hand when the afternoon session was
called to order, and by direction of Mr.
Brewer Special Agent Wales read corre
spondence between the commission and
William S. Thayer, treasu.-er of the Re
publican State Committee in 1898, whose
name was signed to the assessment cir
cular. The commission, it appeared, had
asked Mr. Thayer whether Senator Gal
linger, as chairman of the State Commit
tee had directed or requested the treas
urer to send out the assessment circular.
Mr Thayer said that neither Senator
Gallinger nor the State Committee made
any- suggestions about the circular, but
knew about its being sent to Federal of
ficers. The letter from Louis V. Hoye,
j secretary of the Republican State Com
' mittee,- contained a statement of Mr.
i Thayer and a letter from Senator Gallin
l ger in reply to the same statement that
i the matter of assessing was never dis
| cussed and only acted upon by the com-
mlttee. ... . _ _ Â_
The Senator's letter informed the com
mission that the charges against him
were concocted by evil-minded, malicious
persons and that the complaints were not
made in good faith, but for the purpose
of revenge, and were not worthy the at
tention which the commission seemed to
be giving them. A further letter from
Senator Gallinger stated that he person
ally "did not at any time discuss with
Mr. Thayer or suggest to him the names
of those to whom the assessment circu
lars should be sent."
After an exchange of opinion as to the
opening and closing of the case and the
admission' of evidence after the close of
the hearing, arguments and brief, Senator
Chandler remarked: "The commission
seems to have found out everything con
nected with this Investigation except who
wrote the assessment penned to the office
holders, who fixed the. sums to be as
sessed who directed the inventories and
who sent them out. The essential things
have not been ascertained. It Is for the
commission to do this and find these
men _" Here he was interrupted by Mr.
Brewer. - , .
"I object to these things being taken
Senator Chandlerâ Very well; I will say
it without having it taken down.
Mr. Brewerâ Not in this room. This is
my room, and I pay for it.
â¢ Senator Chandlerâ l am not to be muz
zled ln this room. I have my rights.
Mr. Brewerâ You have no rights except
those of a gentleman. 1,-: <
After a further colloquy, In which, by
implication, each said the other was not
a gentleman. Senator Chandler proceeded
to say that the man most wanted in con-
Curious Custom.
In China It Is the custom for guests at din
ners to run around between the courses. This
is supposed to keep the diner's digestion In
good condition, but the nervous, hustling
American needs something else, and there Is
nothing better than Hostetter's Stomach Bit
ters. If a man or woman is suffering with
constipation, indigestion or any stomach
trouble, it's their fault If they don't get well.
Hostetter's Stomach Bitters will cure them.

nection with the Investigation did not
happen to be present.
"Mr. Thayer is in this city to-day, and
I believe he has been kept away by Sen
ator Gallinger,", said Mr. Chandler.
Senator Gallinger and his counsel. Attor
ney General Eastman, at once shouted:
"That Is absolutely false: It Is not true."
Mr. Eastman continued calling Chand
ler a liar, and said: "I do not care If you
are a United States Senator."
Senator Chandler retorted: "And I do
not care if you are Attorney General.
You are defending criminals when you
should be prosecuting them."
Senator Gallinger appealed to the chair.
Senator Chandler said: "Men who call
other men liars do not need protection. I
repeat, 1 believe Senator Gallinger has
kept Mr. Thayer away."
Senator Gallinger shouted: "You don't
dare to come outside tils room and say
that."
"I will go outside and say it," replied
Afr. Chandler, starting for the door.
Friends restrained both men. and after
a few minutes of confusion the hearing
went on.
Senator Gallinger read a prepared state
ment showing the case against him to be
utterly collapsed and protesting against
its further continuance. He then left the
room, and his counsel, Mr. Eastman,
spoke with a view of softening the harsh
words he had used to Senator Chandler.
The latter made a similar concession to
Attorney General Eastman, and under
such happy auspices the meeting ad
journed, probably never to resume.
The commissioners will not leave town
until to-morrow, but there is little likeli
hood of any further action being taken.
Senator Chandler made a statement to
night, declaring that Commissioner
Brewer "prejudiced the case and con
ducted It in a partial manner; that he
showed great discourtesy to the com
plainants and made it Impossible for the
case to be fairly and fully represented."
It is understood that Senator Chandler
will ask President McKlnley for the re
moval of Mr. Brewer on these charges.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
TRINIDAD, Colo., July 12.â Southbound
passenger train No. 1 on the Colorado and
Southern Railway was robbed by four
men at a point five miles south of Folsom,
N. Mex.
The hold-up occurred at 10:30 o'clock
last night at the same point as the pas
senger train was held up last September.
After the tra-n had been brought to a
standstill and the train crew had been li:
--tirmduffl iv guns the robbers used dyna
mite with good effect, blowing open the
sides of the express car.
Superintendent Webb and the Wells-
Fargo Express agent. Glover, both state
positively that nothing was secured by
the robbers.
Superintendent Webb left for the scene
of the hold-up on a special train, accom
panied by officers with horses. He is con
fident-he will be able to overtake the rob
bers. ,
There were but few passengers on the
train and they were not molested.
As soon as the robbers had searched the
express car they mounted horses, which
were hitched near by, and firing a few
shots to alarm the train men and passen
gers fled, without any attempt to go
through the mail car.
Parties here who claim to know say that
there was a large amount of money ln the
express safe, as well as valuable express
matter. '
ADVERTISEMENTS.
A horse in the lead pulls in vain when
the wheel horse lays back in the breeching.
A man's body is a good deal like a team of
horses, and must work harmoniously. The
head may want to work, and strive ever so
hard to work, but if the body is balky and
sick the head will make no progress.
The man who is out of condition physical-
ly may as well give up try rag" to work men-
tally. He will not be able to do good work,
or satisfactory work, and in the endeavor to
do so will only do himself further harm.
The reason that men have nervous exhaus-
tion and prostration is that they try to work
the brain when the body is balky. The
right thing for a man to do when he finds
he is out of sorts physically is to give the
mind a little rest, and promptly resort to
the right remedy for his physical ailments.
Dr. Pierces Golden Medical Discovery is
the best of all medicines for a balky body.
When the head aches, the appetite is poor,
the sleep is restless, the nerves are shaky
and both body and brain suffer from dull
ness and lassitude, it is time to resort to
this great remedy. It restores the appetite,
corrects all disorders of the digestion,
makes assimilation perfect, invigorates the
liver and purifies and nourishes the blood.
It is the great blood -maker and flesh-
builder. It is the best of nerve tonics and
restoratives It makes both body and brain
alert and active. Medicine dealers have
nothing "just as good." â¢ .'
"I suffered five years with an ulcer and the
doctor here could not do me any good." writes
Mr. John Jenkins, of Haywood". Madison Co..
Va. "I took twelve bottles of Dr. Pierces
Golden Medical Discovery and 1 am well. I
â would have been in my grave' if it had not been
for your medicine."
For constipation and indigestion, Dr.
Pierces Pleasant Pellets are the most nat-
ural and perfect cure ever devised. They
act gently but surely, and effect a. perma-
nent cure. -, V-"

COVELO, July 12.â The finding, of beau- I
tiful Hattie Waltham in a lonely canyon j
eighteen miles from her home, bruised,
scratched, barefooted and unconscious,
but alive, was the welcome news brought
to the affrighted parents by one of the
rescuing party from the mountains to
day. Hattie was found this morning be
fore daybreak, lying exhausted from ex
posure and hunger. The searching party
headed by Samuel Make has the glory of
the rescue. The unconscious girl was
borne out of the mountains on a hurriedly
improvised stretcher constructed of pines j
and evergreens. When she had revived i
she told the following, story of her adven- ;
tures: \:..: â¢. -,
"I could not easily have been made to
realize the awfulness of being lost with
out this experience, and I hope that it
will prove a warning to others, especially
just now, when there are so many camp
ing parties hereabouts. Without a thought
of danger I started out on Monday after
noon with my sketching outfit. I climbed
slowly to the top of a hill and there sat
down to rest. I fell asleep, and when I
awoke it was dark. I became bewildered
and knew not which way to turn.
"My first impulse, which i obeyed, was
to run down the hill, and it brought m
into serious trouble at once. The farther
I went the darker and more densely
wooded the canyon became. My clothing
became torn and my hands and feet were
cut and brulr-ed, but the physical horror
of the situation was as nothing to the
mental. At every rustle of tho leave
I Imagined I had Invaded some rattle
snake's den, and every panther and bear
story I had ever heard came vividly to
my recollection. I hurried on, weeping
and praying by turns, until I reached a
stream of water. Then I knew that I was
on the wrong road. Throughout that
night, the next day and the following
night I still stumbled on, for forty-five,
mortal hours noticing neither dawn nor .
dusk. My mind became a blank and the
last I can recall Is the welcome sight of
the rescuing party. Then I gave way, and !
I suppose I fainted. .Upon regaining my
senses I found myself being tenderly j
cared for by friends, and I pray God that
I may never be lost again."

Preparations are being made by
the American troops in the cam
paign against the Filipinos.
Preparations are being made bq
the Ordnance Department to
supply General Otis with six
Sims-Dudley dynamite pneu
matic weapons. The tests made
at the Sandy ' Hook proving
grounds yesterday of a gun of
this type proved very satisfac
tory.
A gun of the same make was
used by the Cuban insurgents in
their operations, and General
Garcia declared that several
towns were made to surrender
as a result of the use of this
weapon.
Besides the dynamite guns,
Gatling guns will probably be
sent to Otis, and the army trans
ports are to be armed with 6
pounder rapid-fire guns to pre
vent any possible attack by the
insurgents.
.MANILA, July 12.â A copy of the In
dependencia has reached Manila con
taining the speech which Aguinaldo
made during the recent celebration at
Tarlac of the annual anniversary of
the proclamation of Filipino inde
pendence. In substance it is as fol
lows:
Filipinoâ Beloved daughter of the ardent
) sun of the tropics, commended by provi
dence to the care of noble Spain, be not
! ungrateful to her salute who warmed you
I with the breath of her own culture and
1 civilization. It is true she â  "sought to
crush the aspiration for independence as
I a loving mother opposes separation for
ever from the daughter of her bosom.
This but proves the excess of love and
affection Spain feels for the Filipino.
Delicate flower of the east, scarcely
eight months weaned from the breast of ;
thy mother, thou hast dared to brave a
great and powerful nation such as is the
United States, after barely organizing and
; disciplining thy little army. Yet we reply .
I we will be slaves to none, nor allow our
selves to be deceived by soft words. Let ;
us continue to defend our fatherland un- ;
til Independence is assured, for this is
justice. We shall see at last that the
great American nation will acknowledge .
the right whicl> is on our side. That doc
trine of the great Monroe, that America is
for Americans, is not forgotten, just as
i we affirm that the Philippines are for the
Filipinos. Some States of the American
Union have arisen in our favor. Especially
is the Democratic party convinced that
both victors and vanquished will lose
precious lives. Thus many of the people
and many statesmen censure President
McKinley as inhuman for having ordered
his military representatives. at Manila to
i seek means to bring about hostilities with
| the Filipinos. __â¢â¢__ , , ,* ,âl
Tiiese facts prove that they wished to i
1 try us to see if we were able to live up
i to the second color of our banner, which i
' signifies courage, heroism and martyr
dom Therefore we should not resent this :
i struggle with the Americans. In spite of |
this expressed desire to dominate all the
Philippines, well convinced are they that ;
i we fight with justice and right on our side
and that autonomy is all a show of de
ceit, only having to save a certain accum
ulated wealth. â  We have never concealed
our aspirations: that we aspire but to in
dependence; that we will struggle on to
obtain it, perhaps from those who arc j
now our enemies and to-morrow will be
our allies, as they were for the overthrow
of the power of Spain.
We might well accept this autonomy
America offers, but what can we do with
ft if our ambition is independence, and if
we are tc accept it only to later over
throw by force of arms the sovereignty
of America? As. l believe It is the inten
tion of the autonomists to make use of
treachery and deceit we cannot accept j
such a procedure. We do not wish to be
traitors afterward. We wish to show our :
character of frankness and sincerity and
nothing more. Let us avoid the example '
of those natives who, having at one tin-.''
been colonists, accepted autonomy to en- !
able them to make their work surer once i
everything was prepared. History has |
given us an example of this in recent :
events. Let us persist, in our idea, which j
Is only the legitimate "and noble aspira- '-â 
tion of a people which is desirous at all i
cost to preserve Its national honor spot- ,
less and as pure as a crystal.
Thus, then, there will not be a single
Filipino autonomist. Those who are so !
are, in the eyes of the- people, but time
servers, fearful of losing their riches,
threatened by risks of war. Filipinos, let
us be constant! constant! Let us
strengthen the bonds of our union.
Aguinaldo concluded with calling for
cheers for independence, the union of j
the Filipinos and for the liberating
army.

the definite postponement of the discus
sions of the Anglo-American high joint
commission appointed to consider matters
in dispute between the United States and
Canada.
Sir James Winter, the Premier, does not
expect to be summoned to Quebec before
the new year in any event.
Rear Admiral Sir Frederick Bedford will
have nine British warships under his com
mand when he arrives here next week. He
will reorganize the whoje arrangements

WASHINGTON, July 12.â advance
has been made during the past few days
toward the arrangement of a modus
Vivendi fixing temporarily . the Alaskan
boundary line. Meanwhile the 2d of
August draws near and It will become
necessary for our Government to make
formal arrangements with the British
Government for a postponement of the
meeting of the joint high commission.
When the commission adjourned here last
winter It was under a formal order to re
assemble in Quebec on that date. As It is
now realized that owing to the failure of
the Governments of the United States and
Great Britain to settle by direct nego
tiations the Alaskan boundary question,
the commission' could not proceed with
its work, even if it should meet August
2; steps must be taken to vacate the order.
Senator Fairbanks, president of the Amer
ican commission, has notified Secretary
Hay that he will be in Washington within
ten days to report upon his recent visit

FESTIVE KISSING BUG
DISARRANGES HIS FACE
Stockton Man Has a Brief and Pain
ful Interview With the
Melanolestes.
STOCKTON, July 12.â Frank !>tubbs be
lieves that he Is the victim of the festive
kissing bug, and offers his enlarged face
In evidence. He is a cook at John Her
man's place and was out at an early hour
this morning looking for a soothing lotion
for his rapidly, expanding face. One eye
was entirely closed and his face had as
sumed a pealike outline. His familar
features were nowhere discernible. The
face was not discolored at all. With the
exception of a whitish-blue spot where
the. affectionate insect gave him Its sting
and the swelling there was nothing to in
dicate the presence of poison.
"I have been smacked by one of those
kissers," laconically explained Stubbs. "I
sleep in the rear of the resort. About 3
o'clock in the morning I was wakened by
a sharp stinging sensation .on my cheek.
It was very painful, and I lost no time
getting out. I thought at first it might
be a spider sting.' but they tell me the
poison does not act like that of a spider."
After twelve hours the man's face Is
still swollen out of all proportion, but no
acute symptoms have developed to indi
cate that he is in any danger.

HOME FROM THE WORS.
OREGON'S volunteers have returned from the
wars in the far-off Philippines and are now
safe in our harbor. Should the Government
see fit to disembark them here they will receive as
they march through the city the joyous ovation which
a proud people, animated by a spirit of patriotism,
delights to bestow on the heroic brave. Even should
it be determined to renew their voyage and take them
in the transports to Portland to be mustered out, they
will nevertheless have received while in our waters
an evidence of the popular joy over their return and
a manifestation of the honor in which they are held
by their fellow countrymen.
The campaign from which the volunteers have.re
turned has been one which imposed a heavy stress
and strain upon the discipline, the valor and the en
durance of men raised in the temperate zone and ac
customed to the comforts and the freedom of Ameri
can life. Incessant skirmishing, long marches in the
swamps and among the rice fields under a tropic sun,
exposure and the continuous danger of pestilence,
have put their manhood to the supreme test, and they
have borne the trial with such success as to add a
new honor to the glorious record of their State, and
to confirm the confidence of the republic in the trust
worthiness of her volunteer soldiery.
While comparatively few Californians are among
the troops brought back by the transports, the joy
over their safe arrival will be hardly less in this city
than in Oregon. The heroes are our fellow country
men, they are our boys. They have fought in our
war and for our flag. It is to be hoped they will dis
embark here to be mustered out, so that they may re
ceive full proof of our admiration for their valor and
their patriotism. Be that as it may, however, we bid
them welcome back to the shores of the United
States, to their homes and to those who love them.
THE RIGHT COURSE TAKEN.
WITH commendable deference to public senti
ment and the wishes of the rank and file of the
party, the Republican County Committee has
withdrawn the petition asking for the conduct of the
primary election of the party by. a blanket ticket. The
Election Commissioners have granted the committee
until Saturday to file an amended petition, under
which, in accord with the popular will, the elections
will be held by Assembly districts.
By this prompt action the committee has avoided
what threatened to be a disastrous blunder. It has
proven its willingness to act in harmony with the
party as a whole instead of following the lead of a
few would-be bosses. It is now on the right track,
and has only to continue in the same way to assure
Republican success in the coming elections.
The next step is that of providing a strong ticket
of thoroughly representative men in each Assembly
district to be voted for as delegates to the county
convention. Owing to the deep interest taken in the
municipal contest this year it will not be difficult to
get good men to serve as delegates. The convention
therefore ought- to be composed of men who have
the best interests of the party and the city at heart,
and who will nominate worthy men for the high duty
cf organizing the government of the municipality
under the new charter.
There are now good reasons for the expectation
that all will go well with the party. The first blunder
has been corrected and proof given that the voice of
genuine Republicanism is dominant in the party
councils. Republicans are to be congratulated on the
outlook, and the committee merits warm approval
for the course it has taken.
It may be, as reported, that the State Department
will never locate the resting-place of John Paul
Jones, but Americans can always put their fingers on
the place their country's earliest naval hero holds in
history.
The returned Oregonians know a good thing when
they see it. From Colonel Summers down they are
unanimous in their desire to be mustered out at San
Francisco- . . '" lv '" ~; -w- .
A HOLY WAR.
IT is one of the curiosities of the human mind that
whenever war is upon the world, and carnage is
rampant, and the pride and courage of men urge
them on to acts of signal bravery, all the slaughter is
glorified by calling it a holy war.
When Alexander marched from the /Egean to
the Ganges he carried in his headquarters equipment
the sumptuous religious establishment of his country,
and each morning before he ate paid obeisance to the
priests and sought the augurs to learn the will of the
gods. From that day to this the hallowing of war
has been a habit of the people who suffer from it.
But these days are different days. There is in the
world a larger guild of thinkers, of philosophers, of
men who look behind action to its motive. These are
more and more influencing the world's opinions.
They are more and more impressing history with the
truth. They are more and more promoting the
thought that sin in the individual cannot become sin
less in the many individuals who compose a nation.
In the end the influences propagated by such men
prevail, when the tumult of passion and the agitation
of bidders for passing popular favor have passed
away.
One reading a majority of the Fourth of July ora
tions is struck by the lack of thought, of consistency,
of truth, in most of them. In his oration at Metro
politan Temple on that day Mayor Phelan said of the
undeclared war against the Filipinos: "No word of
mine can add to the glory of our soldiers and sailors
who have laid down their lives in the most sacred
war of history."
Such extravagance . of expression is not needed to
perpetuate the worthy memory of the brave dead, nor
to secure adequate recognition of the valor of those
who have survived the rigors of tropical warfare.
Dead and living, they have done their duty, and if
the nature of' it shall impress the people with an
aversion to war and with the love of peace a two
fold benefit will follow their deeds. There is a wide
zone between the cause in which soldiers may fight
and the bravery they show in battle. \
Nearly thirty years ago Holland concluded to
"pacify" Acheen, inhabited by the same race as
Luzon. She is still at it. In that long war the Dutch
soldiers have shown the greatest bravery. While
investing an Acheen stronghold, where the native
flag fluttered from a tall staff,, one day a Dutch sol
dier was seen to run from his own lines into those of
the enemy, and the cry of "Traitor" and some shots
followed him from the ranks he had left. Im
mediately he was seen climbing the Acheen flagstaff
and when he reached the top he tore down the
native colors and put in their place the tricolor of
Holland. As he slid down the staff he was cut into
shreds by the kreeses of a thousand Malays. In the
war against the hill tribes of the Chitral the English
soldiers added to the history of heroism most brilliant
chapters, telling the story of individual bravery. The
Scotch piper, Johnny Findletter, shot through both
feet, squatted on. his bleeding stumps and, without
missing a note, played to the end "The Cock of the
North," the pibroch of the Highland regiment. In
that rough country the British soldiers cut through
ambushes, dodged bullets and bowlders rained on
them from mountain tops, and acquitted themselves
bravely and well.
In Luzon our troops have equaled any of these
deeds of courage, and their countrymen will not for
get them nor history fail to perpetuate their memory.
But reckless bravery in Acheen does not make the
Dutch war holy. The poor hill people of the Chitral
had never harmed England. National policy required
British domination of the poor land where they fed
their flocks in peace, and British statesmen an
nounced" that the Chitral was in rebellion and the
traitors must be punished, though the tribes had
never been â¢ under British subjection and therefore
could not be rebels against it. Their country was
needed as a buffer for the Indian frontier, and their
humble huts were burned, their flocks scattered and
their braves were slaughtered for defending their
homes. The bravery of the British soldiers did not
make such a war holy. It planted in every just
heart a regret that such brave men should be ordered
to death by their country in such a cowardly cause.
Behind the Philippine war is the motive, but it is
distinct from the courage and sacrifice and suffering
of our soldiers, who know their first duty is obe
dience. What harm had the Filipinos done to us?
The cause of human freedom and the upward trend
of humanity have never been served by offensive
wars. The rise of man and the progress of the
world have been in' the keeping of those driven to
war defensively. â¢ When men defend their homes
against invasion they have developed the genius of
self-government. If a war against those who defend
their homes is "sacred," then Mayor Phelan is right.
If it is God's purpose to punish every people who
aspire to independence, or who resent invasion,
Mayor Phelan is a correct : interpreter of the divine
will. If it is sacred, then the Mayor is a worthy fol
lower of Rev. Mr. Henson, who in his pulpit said that
cur Declaration of Independence is "as damnable a
lie" as the devil ever invented, and of Whitelaw Reid,
who says it is "an absurdity."
On the same occasion Judge Cooney said of our
undeclared war against the Filipinos: "Though" it
looks like oppression, this war in the Orient is not.
It is but a lesson to teach the natives in the Eastern
isles the true wortk of liberty."
That is what Cromwell said when his troopers
passed the Pale to pacify Ireland. It looked like
oppression when the Roundheads carried the pierced
bodies of babies on their pikes and left the mothers
groveling and deflowered behind them. The differ
ence between the physical force of the Irish and
Cromwellians was about the same as between the
Filipinos and us. The Irish were overrun, their
lands confiscated, their huts leveled, their crops
tramped into the sod. But from the Cromwellian
standpoint it was all to teach them the true worth
of liberty. They have been slow to learn, but now that
they have the Filipinos for company, and England
and this republic stand shoulder to shoulder, gun in
hand, administering lessons in the true worth of lib
erty, we hope the Judge will apologize for his past
protests against Great Britain's rule in Ireland and
will do justice to the memory of Cromwell and the
holy war he carried into Ireland.
NO. TAMPERING WITH THE MAILS.
SENTIMENTS have , been attributed to the
Postmaster of San Francisco in a. published
interview that require some explanation and
for which no warrant can be found in any official
utterance of President McKinley or of any membei
of his Cabinet. It is claimed that he had expressed
his willingness to inspect articles opposed to. the ex
pansion policy that may be' circulated through the
mail service and to unite with the Postal Inspector
in "having them thrown out." . 'â  â¢

tyranny. It has been condemned by wise and pa
i triotic journalists even as a temporary expedient, in.
the Philippines. It has been roundly denounced as
i it was established by State and by military author
ity combined in Idaho. But a press censorship
j at the Golden Gate would not be endured for a single
hour. The fact that it has been even mentioned
shows the insidiousness and the danger of the impe
rialistic tendencies of the times. '
The Call is an independent American newspaper,
i Republican in politics and devoted to the mainte
nance of our constitutional system of government in
all its integrity. It has no special affection for Mr.
- John J. Valentine, the president of Wells, Fargo &
j Co., whose contributions to anti-imperialistic litera
ture were the immediate occasion of the declarations
; charged to Mr. Montague. But, like every other
j citizen of the United States, and subject to consti
i tutional provisions and to statutes that are an ample
| protection to the public, he has a legal right to ex
j press and to circulate his sentiments upon all sub
'< jects, including the policy of retaining the Philippines.
; Any denial of this right is un American. Any actual
'â  interference with its free exercise would be the act of
i
1 a despot.
The Republican party originated in the assertion of
the rights of free speech and of a free press. It owes
its existence and its prestige to the fact that it up
held these fundamental principles' of free govern
i ment against all opposition and brought the theory
: and the practice of the country into correspondence.
; Talk of a censorship of the press, under a Republican
! administration, is simply nonsense, and only deserves
| attention on .account of the prominence of the indi

ciation at Los Angeles is an event of marked
significance. Since the days of Thomas Arnold
of Rugby, who was pronounced "the greatest school
master who ' ever lived," pedagogy: has become a
science, depending as much upon principles and rules
as upon men and women. - It has been found that 'in
education, as in all other characteristics of modern
civilization, no permanent success can be solely based
upon personal capacity, and that law and system,
which are the noiseless order of the universe, are
also the potential energies through which alone hu
man intelligence can be raised and fitted for the
higher functions of self-government.
There were two incidents in the first day's pro
ceedings of this great association that to some ex
tent affected the symmetry, if they did not mar the
harmony, of the occasion. In receiving the mass of
educators, representing the highest intelligence,
training and refinement that our national institutions
have produced, the Governor of this State, with his
usual lack of tact and with his usual
coarse disregard of fact, referred to our Cali
fornia pioneers as merely the physical agents of
American progress â wielding the ax, the shovel, the
pick and the plow, and rudely preparing a virgin ter
ritory for the higher cultivation that has come to us
at last. In that assemblage there were many dis
tinguished men who could have told a different story.
In the entire history of the world, ancient and mod
ern, no such movement of elevated humanity is re
corded as the migration to California in 1849- Schol
ars, statesmen, jurists, scientists, men who repre
sented the best strains of blood and the finest educa
tional opportunities of the age, were the represen
tatives of the Union and of the world who entered
into the possession of the territorial acquisition that
extended the American republic to the Pacific. The
convention that framed our original constitution was
; the inspiring power of the compromise measures of
j 1850, which were the crowning glory of our national
life as it then existed. The common school system
of this State leaped into comparative perfection when
the long contest ended, and without preliminary tute
lage, California was received into the Union. During
our entire history both private and public education
has flourished with almost- unexampled vigor. Our
two universities, with all their accessories, stand as
monuments to the intelligent grasp, to the sagacity
and to the deep-seated patriotism of the California
pioneers.
The address of Dr. W. T. Harris, United States
Commissioner of Education, was of a different com
plexion. It was pervaded by deep thought and elo-i
quently phrased. But it was stamped by some views
on the question of expansion that will attract com
ment and can hardly be expected to command the
assent of the Government. He used this language:
"The United States can uplift whole nations. Is not
this better than to build a Chinese wall about our
liberties?" The United States has endeavored to
guard the prosperity of its citizens by the policy
of protection and its racial purity by the exclusion
laws. It has been considered for a hundred and
twenty-five years or thereabouts that this continent
was a sufficient field for the exercise of our develop
ing qualities, and that- our national occupation was
the production and the maintenance of a Caucasian
republic. It is only lately that, under a variety of
pretexts, it has been proposed that we should form
a partnership with Great Britain for the enforced ex
tension of our civilization to the inferior races of
Asia and of the Antilles. The development of impe
rialistic ideas, under humanitarian disguises, has al
ready threatened our constitutional system, into
which it is the special function of the American com
mon school system to indoctrinate American youth.
It is an undesirable element in advancing cultivation
to have the theory and the practice of our country
reversed and sentiments avowed and inculcated that
are inconsistent with the special mission that has so
far separated the United States from the monarchy
and from the imperialism of Europe.
Dr. Harris is admirable for his capacity, but we
sincerely trust that, before the association adjourns,
there may be some modification of views that we can
not accept as sound, and that have a tendency to alter
the currents of American patriotism.
There is a disposition on the part of the Southern
Pacific Company to censure the engineer and the
station agent for the train tragedy at Newman. This
will be startling news to the people of .California, who
have been educated by the Southern Pacific to believe
that responsibility , for death on .the rails â¢ is at ' the
door of those killed, because of their criminal
negligence in using Southern Pacific trains. â

"LORD AND LADY
ALG," A RARE
GOOD COMEDY.
A SEASON of the Miller company, in
Carton's refreshing comedy would
make of us all thorough going"
sports, if one night in their society
is a criterion to judge by. We rise to a
man at the fall of the curtain and swag- >
ger out ready "to back any handy jockey
for a place," call our friends "duffers"
and tell, them their choice "has . . no
earthly," that we're not "keen" about
taking their tips and that if we're "given
our head" we're "game" enough to keep
well "Inside the rails." We want to learn
to "take in the points of a horse," -we
want to "have a bit on Flickameroo,"
we'll stake our all with Lady Algy, dia
monds included, and if we lose we'll
"wear paste and begin again." But above
all, we want to "smoke Egyptians!" We're
oyer the mood a little by morning, and
feel more safely conservative, but we
want to see the comedy again at the
earliest opportunity. We come to this
sporty feeling slowly and somewhat tedi
ously, for with restless rapidity the Mar
quis of Quarmby and the Honorable Tud
way fly from subject to subject, avoiding
the one that is nearest their hearts and
closer to the plot of the play, and when
Lord Algy frankly says "I don't see the
point," we echo his sentiments and hope
for speedy light. Nevertheless, this is art,
for in real life, when .we are about to ask
for something we much do yearn for and
have but a slim chance of getting, we
feel our way just as haltingly and
stupidly, staving off a crash as long as
possible. When they finally come to an
understanding the charm begins to work
and we are "with" Lady Algy to the end.
The quiet climaxes in the play are
charming. There is never a bid for a cur
tain call, yet it follows inevitably. The
lines are very cleverâ some instances
better than clever, for their point is
gained in situation and thus action and
speech go hand in hand to success. In
the last act, when Lord Algy leads Mrs.
Tudway, by off-hand persuasion, back to
mediocre respectability, the play is remin
escent of "The Liars." At times, too, we
recall "The Moth and the Flame," but
with the charm of the comedy upon us
we find these impressions but fugitive.
Lord Algy is a man of three grievances.
He wanders through the first act trying
vainly to get some one to enjoy the hos
pitality of his decanters, through the
second on a tipsy search for Mrs. Tud
way, and through all three in search of
happiness and a place to anchor. In the
hands of Mr. Miller Lord Algy so com
pletely wins our sympathy and approval
that if madame had not in the end "come
back to stay" we should have followed
her behind the scenes to undertake her
reformation. That he could hold t-he in
terest of the audience through so long a
tipsy scene as the second act requires,
with but little in the ensemble to strength
en and support it, is, without words
of mine, a sufficient tribute to his ability.
We do not understand the key in which
the second act is pitched. The scene is
too quiet. At fancy dress balls our society
register runs higher. As a nation we love
noise, and when crowds assemble a babel
of voices is indispensable. Mr. Tudway
Is the only real excitement, and he, with
his brigand make-up and "scoundrel, vil
lain, blackguard!" speeches is impossible
and absurd. But I would sit through '
three such acts to see Mr. Miller "take
a header" downstairs .and Miss Anglin
dash across the stage to 'the rescue of poor
tipsy Lord Algy, to hear her sa-y, "Come
along, dear old fellow; I'll get you a cab."
What a touch of nature and what an
artist Miss Anglin is to make the action
seem womanly and refined! I wonder
when we shall decide what role we like
her best in? In hands less skilled we
might find Lady Algy a little Impossible.
The role of the Marquis of Quarmby
was well sustained by Mr. Standing, but
why does he not articulate more distinct
ly? In fact (and let me say it gently, for
when a company is so thoroughly good
It seems carping to pick minor flaws),
several men In Mr. Miller's company will
"never make the blind see with their
ears." The Mawley of young Mr. Whiffen
was exceedingly good. If his face has the
regulation - fifty-five muscles to write the
feelings and passions and emotions with
in, we would never suspect itâ never. Cap
tain Standig*?, the Duke of Droneborough,
Swepson' and Jethro are not new types.
We learn to depend upon them as part
of our regular theatrical income, but we
don't often find the roles as well handled
as they are' in "Lord and Lady Algy."
Swepson is especially good. Mrs. Whiffen
is interesting chiefly as scenery, for the
reason that she has a very stupid, un
grateful part to play. Her costume, after
and a long way behind Reynolds, Is a
stroke of genius. Miss Burton's work is
not good. She is too studied and too fond
of gesture. She does; not seem to have
learned. that thought stills the body and
feeling makes it active. The first set, with
its panels in Flemish oak and touches of
heliotrope and reseda, is, as Mrs. Tudway
says, soothing and restful. In the last
act, when the lights are on, it all takes
on a tone of 'half-mournin^ in beautiful
harmony with the dejected entrance of
Mv Lord, the unlucky, whose tips would
break the Bank of England. In spite of
lts'second act, "Lord and Lady Algy" is
a rare good comedy, and not to see it
twice is hot to know it. â

C. P. Huntington Runs Against a
Snag in the Place He Least
Expected to Find
One. >;->^V
When C. P. Huntington, entering upon
the role of a reformer, proposed doing
away with the saloons along the line of
his road he evidently expected some oppo
sition or protest from the outside. Other
wise he would have signed the order him
self instead of making a catspaw out of
S. N. Foster. But that his action in cut
ting out the booze would cause friction
among the Southern Pacific directors
themselves was a contingency which,
possibly, he did not count upon.
Yet his action has caused friction.^and
lots of it. At the last meeting of the
board the matter, together with the pro
tests filed by the wholesale liquor mer
chants and others interested, was brought
up, and the result was a red-hot meeting
and a head-on collision between the Hunt
ington push on the board and those other
members who were disposed to take a
more equitable view of the matter.
When the order was first issued it was
intended to embrace all the saloons along
the line without any distinction. But this
raised such a howl from the big liquor
houses by whom they are supplied and
from the saloon-keepers themselves, many
of whom the road cannot afford to ignore,
that it was decided to modify the order.
Here is where the clash occurred.
The Huntington supporters decided that
the proper thing to do was to close some
of the saloons and allow others to run
wide open, the discrimination being left
to the judgment of Manager Krutschnitt,
who is body and soul a Huntington man
and knows whom to favor and whom to
deal out severity to.
Those of the board who could see neither
the logic nor justice of such a proceed
ing violently opposed it. They argued that
If one saloon should be closed so should
another, and if the good of the company's
employes demanded that all the. places
along the line shut up, why, then, it
should mean the banishment of liquor
from the dining and buffet cars as well.
For it is just as easy for a trainman to
get liquor on board a car as it is for him
to get off at a station to buy a drink.
They furthermore characterized the or
der as an absurdity in whatever light it
is viewed. It would be impossible for the
road to banish liquor altogether. The
traveling public would not stand it. And,
even if it were possible, it would not pre
vent drinking by the train hands, as noth
ing would be. easier than for a brakeman.
conductor or engineer to carry liquor
along with him secretly, if he so desired.
This opposition, coupled with remarks
which were not entirely complimentary to
their chief's wisdom, greatly angered the
Huntington faction and some pretty
warm talk was Indulged in by both sides.
The meeting finally adjourned without
any definite agreement being arrived at,
the Huntington people declaring that the
matter would go through in the way they
had decided upon and If the others did not
like it and objected to the proposed dis
crimination they could look on, smile and
seem pleased.
The others say that, notwithstanding
the reputation Huntington has for being
a smooth manipulator, they will buck
against him and to such good purpose that
he will find that he has come to a ditch
too wide to be cleared at a bound.
When seen last week, shortly after the
meeting, Vice-President Stubbs, Manager
Krutschnitt and others of the Huntington
followers who were present in attendance
denied that the liquor matter had come
up officially or that any serious discus
sion pertaining thereto had arisen. Vet,
even though "discussion" and "officially"
may not be the proper words, the matter
did come up and provoked enough talk to
be dignified by the word "quarrel" all

Charles Lutz, Driver of a Delivery
Wagon, Imperils the Life of
Tiny Laura Allen.
Through the recklessness of a driver
Laura H. Allen, a child of 4 years, was
run over on Kearny and Sutter streets
yesterday. The child, accompanied by
her mother, had left a Kearny street car
when L. Lutz drove up. Before his vic
tim could escape she was struck down,
both wheels passing over her chest.
Her mother, almost crazed by the acci
dent to her child, hurried her to a near
by drugstore, where she was attended
by a physician. She was suffering from
the shock, but there were no external
evidences of Injury. She was removed to
her home, 306 Laurel avenue, in a car-
rlage.
Lutz was arrested by Officer Caples.
He was first taken to the California
street station and thence to Central sta
tion at the City Hall. After hearing his
statement of the occurrence Judge Mogan
released him on his own recognizance.

many friends; just a warm, hearty hand
shake, a radiant smile and the California
star disappeared to report to the man
ager she adores and fearsâ T. Daniel,
once Tim Frawley.
As the three-sheet posters have already
announced, our Blanche is the same old
Blanche. Happy, merry, absorbed in her
work, unaffected by the great successes
she has achieved and first and foremost
eager to show local theatergoers just
what she can do. Of her Eastern tri
umphs the girl that went out from the
"West to electrify the East speaks reserv
edly. "It was only a step," she said.
"It was not a case of New York ap
plauding but of New York surprised.
They were so astonished that some one
had developed even a little bit without
their knowledge andâ consent.
"To please New Yorkr-that I do not
consider fame. When T.ondon and St..
Petersburg approve of me, then and then
only shall 1 consider myself famous."
Although Miss Bates is modest, she has
dreams. Dreams of a universal art.
where tongues will cut no figure, and
Russia'- capitalâ she is pieased to
consider the center of all high artâ will
applaud an English-speaking actress,
maintaining they need not understand a
word, provided only she speak to them
in the broad language of art.
The petty annoyances that sent Miss
Bates from out the artistic atmosphere
of the great Daly Theater are now nearly
forgotten and altogether forgiven. The
death of the foremost of Americas man
agers, according to the woman who is
probably destined to be the foremost of
American actresses, has wiped out all his
petty traits. "He was a great artist,
she said, "and art is first and foremost.
The people in his company represented to
him only so many stepping stones to one
glorious artistic ensemble. He did not
look upon them as people but as things
to be ordered about in the name and pur
suit of art. ; - -;â 'â  ;
"To me I believe, he took an Instant
dislike, for no other purpose than because
Miss Kenan liked me and was extremely
kind to me. He would allow no individ
uality. When I suggested a" bit of busi
ness that the emotions inspired by my role
prompted he objected. 'You are to feel
nothing,' he said. 'You are simply to be
my reflex artistic Image.' That is the
decree that caused our separation."
Miss Bates finds it impossible to speak
of her progress and success without tender
grateful words for the man who, accord
ing to herself, "made her." "I can never
do enough for Mr. Frawley," she said.
"I owe everything to him. Who would
have ever given me the chances he has?
Who would have worked with me as he
has? Talk of Belasco and his hair-pulling
course of instruction! What about Fraw
ley at rehearsal? He has sent me home
In disgrace. He has made me repeat and
repeat and again repeat. And, oh, more
stinging of all, he has questioned my In
telligence." -
When Miss Bates finished the recital of
her suffering at Frawley's hands she
sighed | and then laughed merrily. The
manager himself, who was standing by,
smiled down upon her with admiring eyes
and said. "Yes, I have been your most
severe critic." Then Frawley laughed
and Miss Bates laughed, and star and
manager exchanged a quick, warm glance
and clasped hands.
The repertoire for Miss Bates' engage
ment Is full of good things, and, further,
contains one great surprise. "London As
surance" will be presented, costumed in
the period In which It was written. Miss
Bates will make her Initial appearance in
"The Last Word," and will appear in the
surpriseâ a new play written especially
for her.
A Vacation's Sad Ending.
The body of little Corlnna Splivalo,

CAPTAIN TURNER BLAMED.
United States Inspectors Bolles and
Bulger Suspend His License for
Sixty Days.
United States Local Inspectors Bolles
and Bulger filed an opinion yesterday sus
pending for sixty days the license of Cap
tain John Turner of the fishing steamer
Henrietta. The Henrietta ran upon Dux
bury Reef on June 15 in a thick fog and
was slightly damaged. In rendering their
opinion the inspectors say:
After a careful consideration of the testi
mony in this case we are of the opinion that
Captain John Turner was negligent and un
skillful ln navigating the steamer Henrietta
at full speed in a thick fog and not sounding
at short intervals when he had no definite de
parture. Had he used his lead Instead of trust
ing, as he testified he did, to get his position
by hearing the whistling buoy off Dux bury
reef he would have discovered that the vessel
was in shoal water, and he could have avoided
striking the reef. â¢ â "â â â â¢' -'" â  ,\. â  ; .\
For reason of such negligence and unsklllful
ness we have this day suspended Captain Tur
ner's license as master and pilot of steam ves
sels for Â£0 days.
MYSTERIOUS SHOT
STARTLES J. CLAUSSEN
HE SUSPECTS W. DASSMANN JR.
OF FIRING IT.
Thinks That an Attempt Was Made
to Murder Him by the Son
of a Rival Grocer.
John Claussen. a grocer, doing business
at the corner of Howard and Thirteenth
streets, believes that an attempt was
made to murder him a few days ago.
He was standing behind his counter, when
he was startled by the shattering of his
j show window. On investigating he found
j that a bullet had pierced two panes of
! glass and a five-gallon can of coal oil.
The telephone is a foot away from the
I point where the bullet entered, and it is
i fortunate that no one was using it at the i
i time, as he would have undoubtedly re- j
I ceived the bullet in his head or face.
Claussen strongly suspects that William
Dassmann Jr., son of a rival grocer on the [
I opposite side of the street, fired the shot, j
He draws his conclusion from the fact !
that the positions of the two bullet holes I
in the panes of glass are such that the j
shot was "fired -from the inside of Days- i
man's store. The boy, who is 17 years of [
age, has been in the habit of using a 22
--caliber air rifle to shoot birds with in the I
neighborhood and the bullet found by I
Claussen in the coal oil can is a No. 22.
Claussen says that Dassmann Sr. has
borne him ill will ever since he moved out !
of Dassmann's premises. His five-year
lease expired three years ago and Dass
mann refused to renew it except at a
much higher rate, so Claussen moved j
across the street. Dassmann started up a !
grocery store on his own premises.
Officer Potter Investigated the case, but !
the Dassmann boy strenuously denied that
he fired the shot and no arrests have been
made. Some time ago the boy broke a
pane of glass with his air gun in a bakery ;
near by, but his father settled the dam
ages. :'. - -:.;:;;â¢,

Four of the crew of the steamer Caro
line were poisoned yesterday and only re
covered after suffering excruciating
agony. The vessel had been over to the
quarantine station to bring back the
steerage passengers of the Nippon. After
landing the Chinese at the Mail dock the
Caroline went back to Clay street wharf
and tied up. The men then had their
breakfast, and shortly after that were
taken violently sick. Four of the men-
Oscar- Anderson, mate; P. Guerrero,
Charles Veilbaum and Ed Abbott, deck
handsâ were so bad that they had to be
removed to the Harbor Hospital, where
they were attended by Dr. Morrison. The
coffee for breakfast had been made in an
old pot and an examination of this uten
sil showed that there was some verdigris
in it. This was what caused the poison
ing. Veilbaum was very sick and could
not be removed from the hospital, but
the others after being treated were as
well as ever.
The transport City of Para will get
away for Manila to-day with companies
A, F, H and X, Twenty-fourth Infantry,
and troops D and X, Fourth Cavalry.
Colonel Gilbert S. Carpenter and Colonel
William H. Bisbee and Assistant Sur
geons S. Chase de Kraft, E. C. Schultze,

The steam collier Washtenaw and the
schooner Free Trade were in collision off
Point Bonita last Tuesday night. The
schooner's main boom was smashed and
one of her crew hurt, so Captain Thor
son came back for repairs. The Washte
naw proceeded.
Some people seem to have a grudge
against the steamer Cottage City and
every chance they get start a rumor that
some accident has happened to the vessel.
About a month ago they had her ashore
and racing with the Humboldt. There
was not a word of truth in either state
ment. Yesterday another story to the ef
fect that she had struck on a rock while
en route to Dyea was put in circulation,
when the fact of the matter is the vessel
is alongside the wharf at Seattle, being
overhauled. Such stories are malicious
and should be stopped, as the vessel car
ries a big crew and crowds of passengers
and their friends quickly hear the stories
and are scared nearly to death in conse-
quence.
The steamer Umatilla sails for the I
sound next Saturday and will connect '
at Seattle with the Roanoke for St. Mich
ael and Cape Nome. The Umatilla is one
of the largest and finest steamers on the
coast, and intending gold hunters are go
ing up on her in dozens. At Seattle the
miners will join the ex-transport Roan
oke and will go almost direct to the Cape
Nome fields, as only a short stop will
be made at St. Michael.
Captain Gielow has taken command of
the steamer Santa Cruz, as Captain Ol
sen has gone north to take command of
the Orizaba. The latter steamer is go
ing to make a special trip to Alaska with
dynamite and combustibles.
The battleship Wisconsin will go on
Hunters Point drydock next week to
have her propeller put on. All the bar
bette armor is in place on the battleship,
but her side armor may not be here for
months. When the latter has been put
on the Wisconsin will be unable to dock
here, and that is why she is having her
wheel put in now. â¢ There Is a possibility
of the Wisconsin having her trial trip
on Puget Sound. She will not be ready
for her government test until the first of
next year, and by that time she will be
ready'for drydocking again. With all her
armor on the only dock that will be able
to accommodate her will be Port Orchard,
and if she has to go there she will re
main on the sound and have her govern
ment test there instead of on the Santa
Barbara channel. â¢ ,
The" fine American steel ship Aryan is
causing her owners some anxiety these
days. She is now out twenty-six days
from Honolulu and the Irmgard, Stand
ard Bendixsen and Mohican are out from
twenty-six to thirty-one days. Still, if the
Aryan came along everybody would be
pleased, while no fears are entertained for
the other vessels. When the Aryan came
here five years ago on her maiden voy
age there was a leak somewhere that
could not be located. That leak has kept
on getting worse, until it <*ot so bad while
the vessel was in Honolulu that her char
ter had to he canceled (she was to load
sugar for New York). A diver was sent
down and everything possible done to lo
cate the leak, but all efforts failed, and
the Aryan is coming to San Francisco to
go on the drvdoek. That is why her own
ers will be glad to hear of her arrival.
The chances are that the American ship
George Curtis, now at Honolulu, will come
to San Francisco and be added to the
sugar fleet. The vessel is for sale, and
an offer for her by a San Francisco house
went down on the last steamer. The offer
will probably be accepted, and the Curtis
will in that event come here instead of go
ing to New York. .... --.'â¢â 'â â  --?*â â â  Â« / â :

VALLEY ROAD ELECTIONS.
Annual Meeting of the Directors,
Which Is Set for Tuesday
Next. .
On Tuesday next the directors of the
Valley road will hold their regular annual
meeting for the purpose of going over in
a general way the business of the year
just passed and of electing officers for the
year to come.
Owing to the absorption of the Valley
road by the Santa Fe system it is proba
ble that E. P. Ripley of the Santa Fe will
be elected to fill the vacancy which will
be created by the resignation of Claus
Spreckels from the presidency of the road.
Aside from this it Is not expected that
the present executive staff will be very
materially altered, though in some of the
minor positions many changes may take
place.

this port this year.
Mail will leave Seattle for St. Michael
and Yukon River points, including Daw
son City, on July 20 and August 20. Mat
ter for these trips should be deposited in
the San Francisco Postoffice at least
three days earlier. Mail for St. Michael
will be shipped whenever received, but
the postoffice authorities will not guar
antee that any mail will go up the Yu

But if You Have Kidney or Bladder
Trouble It Will Bo Found Just
the Remedy You Need.
Kidney trouble preys upon the mind,
discourages and lessens ambition:
beauty, vigor and cheerfulness soon
disappear when the kidneys are out of
order or diseased.
Kidney â¢; trouble has become so preva-
lent that it is not uncommon for a
child to be born afflicted with weak kid-
neys. If the child urinates too often,
if the urine scalds the flesh, or if, when
the child reaches an age when it should
be able to control the passage, and it
is yet afflicted with bed-wetting, de-
pend upon .it, the cause of the difficulty
Is kidney trouble, and the first step
should be toward the treatment of these
important organs. This unpleasant
trouble is due to a diseased condition
of the kidneys and bladder and not to
a habit as most people suppose.
So we find that women as well as
men are made miserable with kidney
and bladder trouble and both need the
same remedy. The mild and the im-
mediate effect of Swamp-Root is soon
realized. It is Bold by druggists, in

SOUTHAMPTON, July 12.â A1l sorts of
delusive reports are current here. In de
fault of news concerning the. reasons for
the Shamrock being docked, and wanting
a sensation at any price, some of the
press representatives dish up the worst of
reports, with a little sauce dlable of their
own.
This particular sensational proclivity Is
stia further aggravated by the absolute
reticence of all persons connected with
the Shamrock. Truth naturally cannot be
so interesting as fiction, but the truth is,
that the docking of the Shamrock- was
merely owing to the fact that certain
calking -wa* found necessary. It was not
cwing, as has been stated, to a plate giv
ing way, but in a general way. as" might
be expected in a new yacht. Sir Thomas
I.'^ton naturally denies the leakage story.
One of the principal reasons for the
decking was that there is plenty of time
now, and there will not be time when the
yacht gets to Clyde. Docking her for only
slight defects is a luxury which Sir Thom
as tan afford.
The yacht has now been in the water
nearly three weeks, and the designer and
captains were unanimous in the opinion
that a general overhauling and inspection,
with a tut recaiking and polishing of her
bronze bottom, would be of much practi
cal value.
tiir Thomas jpton's big yacht Erin re
mains cJut in the waters of Hythe, look
ing lonesome without the gay-colored
Shamrock. Owing to the fact that the
tailing spin between the Shamrock and
Britannia will not be possible before July
lb the situation is somewhat altered.
First, then will probably be only time
for one sail; second, matters will have to
be hurried up in the north to get her
litted out in time.
Sir Thomas, I hear, wishes absolutely
that she should start out on her voyage
from Clyde during the first week of Au
gust, and by the end of that week at the
latest. You may now take it that she will
leave here as soon as possible after
July 18.
The Britannia as I saw her yesterday
at Cowes. after having left Fay's yard,
appears as though she were new, with
fresh, copper, new keel, boom and gaff.
Marvin of Cowes is busy cleaning her
Hpars; she has been recalked and has new
bulwarks and taffrail. besides which lots
of new work has been put In her below.
She has been upholstered afresh.
The Satanlta, her old rival, is being
scrubbed. She has been docked at Fay's
yard and is nearly ready for Cowes' great
yachting week. The Meteor remains at
anchor off Hythe, waiting, it is said, for

LAUNCH OF THE NEW CUP CHALLENGER, THE SHAMROCK.
From a Photograph.
T'l "\ ENSE mystery' surrounded the Shamrock, the challenger for the American cup, up to the time that she slid into the?
til water from the ways at Fife's shipyard. Details concerning her are still kept secret to the greatest possible extent. 4
y I I but the shrewd observers who have seen her in the water are able to describe her. with sufficient exactness toi
â¦ II satisfy any one except an expert in the technicalities of yacht building. The Shamrock is supposed to draw over 20 '
<$, â  J feet of water, which fact was indicated by her grounding at a place where the water is said to be 20 feet deep. She!
+ has a mainsail that weighs a ton, and 26 men were required recently to roll It up. It Is the largest cutter mainsailf
/that has ever been bent In England. The total length' of the Shamrock is 125 feet. One report^,
ihas it that her draught is 18 feet 6 inches. This is probably a mistake. The canvas alone in the mainsail'
f weighs near about 2400 pounds. The Shamrock will be commanded in the great race by "Archie" Hogarth,, .who formerlyT
manded the famous Isolde. Second in command when the Shamrock meets the Columbia will be Robert Wringe, whoT
â¦ haÂ« won reputation as commander of the Allsa and also as master of the Duke of Abr;:z_i's Bona. The Shamrock s crcwj
â¢iwlll consist of thirty men who have been selected with great care, the selection being baaed upon their experience as racing
â¦ yachtsmen in British waters. Before the Shamrock meets the Columbia there will be trial spins against British yachti,'*
and the Prince o.* Wales will probably sail the Shamrock on at least one occasion against his yacht, the Britannia. The a

The championship race of the California
Baseball League is developing into quite
a struggle, and it looks certainly hard to
; select the winner. A month ago indica-
I tions pointed to a ding-dong finish be-
I tween the Santa Cruz and Friscos for
' leading honors, but since then the per
! centage of the leaders has taken quite a
tumble and Sacramento and San Jose
have improved their positions consider
ably. It is not expected that either Oak
land or Watsonvllle will make a bid for
the top of the heap, and It seems as if
these two clubs are destined to fight It
out for tail-end honors. Between Sacra
mento, San Francisco and San- Jose con
ditions arc beginning to shape /so that it
will be extremely difficult to select a win
ner. At the present writing Santa Cruz
leads the Friscos by a small fraction of a
game. Frisco leads San Jose by a game
and a halt and San Jose leads Sacramento
by but one. game, so it can be seen from
these figures that each of these clubs
has an equal chance to win out. Follow

to strengthen their weak spots and tele
grams are being sent all over. the country

substantia] inducements to join the Wat
sonviUes. â¢
Shea has been released by the Oaklands
and Is seeking a position as pitcher.
Kelly, who pitched the game for Wat
sonvllfe last Sunday morning, is the left
handed twlrler of the Santa Clara College
team. He pitched a fair game, although
it would be hard to judge his abilities
from this game, as the team gave him
very poor support.
The Sacramentos expect to have a new
first baseman for this week's series. His
name is O'Connor and he hails from the
Texas League. He Is reputed to be a
good one and a very aggressive player.
Tebeau Is playing Donlin at first In
daily practice. He Is much pleased with
bin work, and he says it is only a ques
tion of a short time when he will be the
permanent guardian of the initial bag for
the St. Louis team.
The new batting order of the Friscos
seems to work beneficially, judging by re

The San Jose team has been cutting
quite a "swath" among the leaders. This
is due In a great measure to Andrews'
splendid pitching, and if Borchers will get
in line and pitch up to his standard there
Is no telling where the crack club will
stop.
The game Iberg won last Sunday morn
ing was the first the locals have taken in
which he pitched for a month.
Oakland seems to be prolific of first
basemen, as they have a new guardian
of that bag every game they play. This
has been a peculiarly weak spot of the
Athenians all season.
It was feared that Pace, the hatchet
man of the â¢"Sandcrabs," might cause
trouble with the umpire In last Saturday's
game, but Pace was a good boy and al
lowed Jeffries to give his decisions with
out any forcible resistance. He prcba-
bly sized the champion up and thought
discretion the better part of valor. Pace
was suspended for thirty days, but the
management and he have patched up
some sort of a truce and he has been re-
Instated. Pace has been a trouble maker
and dlsorganlzer ever since the season
opened.
"Jay" Hughes won every game he
pitched In May and June. Phil Knell is
doing great work for Hartford: He is
pitching in old-time form and winning
games for his team. Loekhead is playing
a wonderful game for Cleveland. "Rab

COMMANDS A SPLENDID
MILITARY ORGANIZATION
COLONEL WILLIAM P. SULLIVAN JR.
Colonel Sullivan is at the head of the League of the Cross Cadets.
THE one thought in the minds of the members of the League of the
Cross Cadets at the present moment is their annual encampment
which is to commence on Saturday. The various companies in tne
famous organization are planning to outdo each other In the wa: or
entertainment and decoration. For months past the cadets have Been
dreaming of the camp and as joys and hardships, and now that tneir
dreams are to be realized the young soldiers are waiting anxiously to oegiu
1 e Although the young men are happy in the belief that they are going
have a delightful time, yet, they know the trip to Santa Cruz is not alone
for pleasure. Strict military rule will be enforced at the camp: " tru^"Â°"
In the art of maneuvering will be given them and discipline will be enrorcea
throughout the eight days they are living under canvas. .
Lieutenant Mahoney will to-day escort an advance guard to the city Dy
the sea and under his supervision numberless tents will be pitched ready ior
occupancy on the arrival of the regiment. On Saturday afternoon the regi
ment, preceded by its excellent band, will march down Market street to tne
ferry and take the narrow-gauge train for the place of encampment. Colonel
Sullivan is confident that nearly five hundred men will be in attendance.
, On Sunday last Colonel W. P. Sullivan Jr.. Lieutenant Colonel T.-\
Ryan Major D. G. McGloin. Major D. C. Deasy, Major William H. McCarthy,
Captain J. P. Duffy, Lieutenant Harry Mahoney, Lieutenant J. A. Watts.
Thomas H. Fallon, in honor of whom the camp is named, and M. Abrahams
visited Santa Cruz and laid out the plan of encampment. It was decided to
pitch the tents east of the baseball grounds so that the camp will border on
the beach. This location was chosen as there is a fine drill ground close by.
Military mass will be celebrated on both Sundays during the encampment
by Father O'Rvan. The services will be held In the Dolphin bathhouse.
Bishop Montgomery, who is beloved by the regiment, has been Invited to
become an honored guest of the camp.
The social features of Camp Falion will afford much enjoyment to the
cadets and the residents of Santa Cruz. On the night of the arrival of the
young soldiers the regimental band will give a concert. Monday evening will
be devoted to dancing and Tuesday night to a concert on the beach. On
Wednesday night the members of the Young Ladles' Institute will tender the
regiment a reception in the armory of the Naval Reserve. A dance will be
held on Thursday night and on Friday night the cadets will give a minstrel
show for the benefit of Father McNamee's new school. A baseball game has
been arranged for the next day between a nine from the regiment and a pro
fessional team composed of Santa Cruz players.
Colonel William P. Sullivan, who commands the regiment, is very popular
with the boys. He has been at their head for many years. He is a thor
ough soldier, having obtained his military education in the National Guard
and at school. He Is secretary to Mayor Phelan and as such has rendered the
city's chief executive valuable assistance during the past three years.

TEMPORARY RELIEF GRANTED

CASH SET ASIDE FOR ONLY ONE
MONTH'S EXPENSES.
â â Â«
The Board Adopts a Resolution Al
lowing' Comraissioners 59100, but
Postpones Further Action Until
Phelan's Return.
The woes of the Fire Department are
quieted for a month; the Supervisors
have shifted Their load of worry Over the
"dollar limit"; downtown merchants and
out of town improvement clubs may
cease their clamor against the threatened
abbreviation of their fire protectionâ and
the buck has been duly passed to Mayor
Phelan. I
The Board of Supervisors has granted
thirty days' relief to the Fire Department
ln the shape of $9100 out of the urgent
necessity fund, and it will devolve upon
the superior wisdom of the Mayor In
things municipal to devise ways and
means to keep the engines steaming and
salaries paid after the month is up.
Notwithstanding this action by the
board, petitions and protests from mer
chants and residents of the different dis- |
tricts from which the Commissioners I
have threatened to remove tire engines I
continue to pour in to Clerk Russell's of- I
fice. They arc. however, not of the char- I
acter that it was calculated the Commis- I
sioners' bluff would bring forth. They
one and all object to any of the tire com
panies being disbanded, but for the most
part they also state that in the belief of
the signers there would be no necessity to
lessen fire protection if the business of
that department were properly adminis
tered.
The Finance Committee of the board
was not to have given further considera- |
tion to the matter until 2 o'clock yester
day afternoon, but when the members !
gathered yesterday morning to continue
with their equalizing of Assessor Dodge's j
assessments they found time to take it j
up and settle it out of hand. The com-.
mittee came to an agreement shortly be
fore the board met. and then offered a
resolution which provided that the sum I
of $0100 should be transferred from the
urgent necessity to the Are fund to pro
vide for the general expenses of the de- ]
partment for the month of July. Chair
man Perrault moved the adoption of the j
resolution, and when It came to a vote j
there was no voice in dissent.
The Fire Commissioners bad billed their ;
meeting for 10 in the morning, but upon
the suggestion of Supervisor Perrault, j
made on Tuesday evening, had postponed
It to 2 o'clock this afternoon. They were j
at once informed of the board's sudden
action, but after some discussion decided
that they would make no change in the
plan as it stood.
The resolution adopted by the board
upon Perrault's motion was as follows:
Resolved, That the board hereby
adds to the estimates made by reso
lution No. 3148 (fourth series) the sum
of $9100 for the purpose of paying the
necessary expenses if the several fire
companies now organized for the
month of July, IK??.
Resolved, That further action will
be taken on his Honor the Mayor's
return to corn the said estimate, so
that suitable provision be made for
the maintenance of said department.
Resolved, That the attention of the
Auditor and Treasurer be and hereby
is called to the provisions of this reso
lution.
CHARGED WITH FRAUD. i
Ernest Lang Is Made Defendant in ;
Two Lawsuits.
Ernest Lang of 2821% Mission street was
made defendant in two suits filed in the !
Superior Court yesterday, one for $3000 j
damages for malicious prosecution, the I
other to recover possession of property !
valued at $0000, the deed to which is al
leged to have been procured by the de- j
fendant through fraud and duress.
The damage suit prew out of that in
stituted for the recovery of the property.
From the complaint it appears that P. C.
Trusseau ar.d his wife, Catherine, who
is Lang's mother, resided at 2S2ltÂ£ Mission
street up to May last. Mrs. TruSÃ.au died
on May 22, and in her will Robert King
-was named as executor. During the course
of administration upon the estate King
discovered that the family resilience at
the address given had been deeded to
Lang. On investigation, M c executor al
leges, he found that Lang went to the
house of his mother accompanied by a
woman named Mrs. Ingelhart and abused
Mr. Trusseau roundly, and then forced
Mrs. Trusseau to deed her property to'
him. It is also asserted that Lang was
supported by Notary Public A. K. Dag
gett, who is made a party defendant in
the suit brought to declare the deed null
and void.
After this trouble Trusseau retained At
torney N. B. Melville to prosecute the
suit for the recovery of the property, and
fine day while the attorney and client
were in consultation Lang caused the ar
rest of Melville on a charge of disturbing
the peace. Melville was promptly acquit
ted by acting Police Judge Groezinger,
and with the suit to set aside the deed in
question filed another against Lang ask
ing for damages in the sum of $3000 for
malicious prosecution. Melville claims
that through his arrest his character and
business have suffered in the sum sued

QUESTIONING A FRIEND.
If one takes the trouble to carefully
question a person that has been using
Grape-Nuts food for two or three
weeks the facts will be brought out
that gradually there comes over the
body a feeling of Increased strength,
particularly of mental strength and
ability.
The mind works clearer and more ac-
tively when It plays upon a brain that
Is refreshed, rebuilt and properly con-
structed by the food elements intended
by Nature for such work.
This is a profound fact regarding
Grape-Nuts. The food contains Just the
kind of material Nature must have to
unite with albumen, from which to re-
build the gray matter in the brain and
nerve centers throughout the body.
Therefore the user can expect and ob-
tain a definite result from the regular
use of Grape-Nuts. Price 15 cents per

YEE YEM FORGOTTEN
TEN MONTHS IN JAIL
YUNG YEE YEM has been supported for the last ten months in the
County Jail at the' expense of the Government, and nobody except
the Sheriff and the man at the sub-treasury who pays the bills .or
Uncle Sam seemed to be aware of Yem's existence.
Yem could not have been more completely buried and forgotten In
tho old French bastile for that length of time than he was in the San Fran
cisco Jail. He could have been taken out at any time and his case could
have been disposed of in fifteen minutes, as it was yesterday, if the business
of the Government had been transacted in the Appraiser's building as sys
tematically as private business is conducted in a mercantile establishment.
The District Attorney's office, which was supposed to attend to his prose
cution did not discover Yem's existence until a day or two ago. The United
States' Marshal's office, which is supposed to know Its prisoners, received a
letter from Yem announcing his fatigue and requesting an examination. The
Marshal's deputies say that they notified the District Attorney's office of the
plaint of Yem. Â».__., _, . _
United States Attorney Coombs has been Installed but recently, ana he
had no means of knowing that Yem was neglected or that there was such a
person as Yem. He proposes, in order to prevent a repetition of the blunder,
to require the Sheriff to file each month with his demands against the United
States treasury for the keeping of prisoners a complete list of all United States
prisoners in his charge, with the date of the admission of each into tho
County Jail. . _ _ .
Yem ten months ago was discharged from San Quentin, having served a
term of one year and ten months for larceny committed in Los Angeles. He
was placed in the constructive custody of the United States Marshal to be
examined for deportation, because he was without a certificate of registra
-1 Yesterday Yem was taken before United States Commissioner Heacock
and the original certificate was found in the revenue office. He will be dis
charged to-day.
SHE WANTED
TO SCARE KOPP,
THAT WAS ALL
Accused Wife Tells a
Pitiful Tale.
â â
There were tears and sobs in Judge Con
lan's court yesterday morning. The usual
Police Court audience, hardened to the
tale of misdoing and suffering, listened
i with wet eyes and labored breathing when
i Mrs. Kopp told of her life with the
'â  husband she murdered. Mrs. Bertha Mon
! ti, the woman at the bottom of all the
i trouble, was an interested spectator. Trim
! and 'neat in her widow's weeds, she heard
! the accused woman tell how she had
i wrecked her heme and taken from her In
| her hour of suffering the husband who
! should have been her support and com
! fort.
Mrs. Kopp spoke In strained whispers.
I The Judge, her counsel, the prosecuting
â  attorney and court *â¢ stenographer were
! obliged to gather close to her to catch
: her trembling words. When, however, she
! told how she had gone to Mrs. Monti and
on bended knees had begged her to give
! her her husband back the intensity of her
emotion lent volume and strength to the
weakened tones. Her pitiful cry of Give
me back my husband. I have not long to
live. Let him stay by me to comfort
me." was heard all over the courtroom,
; and if there were any dry eyes when she
fell back exhausted ln her chair they were
the shining, pitiless eyes of Mrs. Monti.
The examination of Mrs. Kopp conclud
ed the preliminary examination. Judge
Ferral led the defendant to the witness
stand. Owing to the weakened condition
of the woman it was decided to have the
examination concluded as quickly as pos
sible. No promptings were necessary to
make Mrs. Kopp tell of her troubles and
the killing of her husband. She told her
story in a straightforward, honest man
ner, striving neither to conceal anything
nor shield herself. Now and then sobs
choked her utterance, and again the hack
ing cough made speech impossible.
Mrs. Kopp's recital bore out in detail the
same tales of cruelty and abuse brought
forward by the other witnesses during the
trial. The only points that she threw any
light upon were the purchase of the pistol
and the actual killing. '.'- : ~'7.
"I went to Mrs. Monti, said the ac
cused woman, "and begged her on my
knees to give my husband back to me.
'I have not many months to live,' I told
her; 'let me have him these last few
days to love and to comfort me.'
"Mrs. Monti denied that my husband
either came to see her or cared for her.
After I pleaded with the woman I went
to Kopp. He mocked me, beat me and
caught me by the throat and choked me.
'I will go with Mrs. Monti as much as I
like,' he said, 'and don't think you can
boss me.' - .
"My husband," went on the unhappy
woman, "grew to be so cruel and threat
ening that I felt I needed protection. I
had a bolt put on my door so I could
lock myself in when I was in the house
alone with him, and I bought a pistol,
thinking I would show it to him and scare
him. 1 had it for two weeks, hid away
in the closet and not loaded. Then he
began to choke me and threaten violence
and I loaded the pistol.
"On the day I met him in the restau
rant with Mrs. Monti, when he came
home he was abusive in the extreme. He
had caught our little child by the throat.
He demanded of me a card a lady had
left, and while I went to get It I heard
him go to the knifebox in the kitchen.
He was cursing. I was afraid and put
mv pistol in my pocket. When I went
toward him he made an attempt to grab
me. I drew my pistol from ray pocket.
I must have fired. He fell, and I knelt
down beside his form.''
Judge Conlan decided he would like to
1 hear argument in the case, although
I Judge Ferral, attorney for the accused
; woman, was willing to at once submit it
jto his Honor. Accordingly it was ar
i ranged that Judge Low. for the people,
i and Judge .Ferral. for Mrs. Kopp argue
, the case Friday morning at 11. In the
meantime Judge Conlan will read over
the testimony and may be ready to ren
der his decision on Friday morning.
ECHOES OF THE FOURTH.
Committee Is Obliged to Scale Down j
Some of the Bills.
The Fourth of July committee 13 con
fronted with a problem which It may And
difficult to solve to the satisfaction of all
concerned. It appears that the auditing
committee audited a number of bills, but j
i omitted two important items in its cal- !
! culations which created a deficiency and j
will necessitate the scaling down of ,
claims which yet remain to be paid. The j
two items are $134 for Cassasa's band
and $27 50 for the San Francisco Drum j
Among those who will have to be satis
fled with less money than they antici- |
pated receiving is Miss Rose Vldaver, as- i
! slstant secretary, who put In a claim for ;
$150 for services. This will be cut down j
to $100, and considering that the lady Is I
employed in the office of City and County j
Attorney Lane at a salary of $(5 a month <
is considered by the committee as suffi
cient remuneration for her work. Miss
Hopkins, the stenographer, who expected
to receive $75 for three weeks' typewrit
ing will have to content herself with $50.
Chairman George Fletcher and Treas
urer James Devlin will sign the checks
this morning and will make reductions in
other claims in order to make up the
$26150 omitted in the original list of au
dited accounts. â  â¢ â 
There Is one claim that"will not be al
lowed and that Is the one calling for $20
for lunches served to Miss Vldaver. At
the request of one of the members of
the committee. John Fay of the Grand
â Hotel bar provided eatables for Miss Vld
aver but the bill will not be paid out of
the finances allowed for the celebration.
The bill of $8 for damages to a buggy
driven by Secretary Robert Dennis will
be settled by the committee.
All bills will be paid this morning at I
320 Sansome street between 9 and 11 :
o'clock. â  . â¢

nickel-in-the-slot machine in hie saloon,
32 Second street. The decision affects
sixteen others who were arrested at the
same time, about six months ago. x
The machine was one that disgorged
checks payable by drinks or cigars at the
bar The Judge said that he was not only
of the opinion but firmly convinced that
no living mortal had a chance to win at
such a game against the owner of the ma
chine and that such machines and similar
gambling devices should not be tolerated
in any civilized community. After a care
ful investigation of the machine he found
that it had connecting wires run by elec
tricity which prevented ; the winning of
any high numbers, and it was lucky if
the player got out of the game without
losing his head.
In other States of the Union the mere
possession of these machines was made a
felony by the statutes, punishable by im
prisonment in the State prison for a term
of years, because it was not only obtain
ing money by a -fraudulent gaming device
but it was also obtaining money by means
of trick and false pretenses. For these
reasons the defendant was found guilty
and was ordered to appear for sentence
this morning.

CROP BULLETIN.
A. G. McAdle, section director United States
Weather Bureau, for the California Crop Bulle
tin, week ended July 10, Issues the following:
Normal temperatures have prevailed through
out the State during the week, and no precipi
tation was reported. Grain harvesting contin
ues, and threshing has commenced in some sec
tions. The yield of wheat in the northern and
central portions Is very - heavy, and the quality
generally good. Barley is proving better in
some localities than had been anticipated, but
the yield and quality are not quite up to the
average. Deciduous fruits are ripening rapidly,
and are being shipped and dried. Peaches are
the chief crop, and the yield is enormous; other
fruits with the exception of apricots and
prunes, are yielding fairly well. The red spider
has appeared ln some orchards, the thrips have
attacked vineyards, but no material damage
has been reported. Watermelons are in market.
At present the outlook is good for corn, sugar
beets, beans, potatoes and all vegetables, The
second crop of hay Is being harvested. Pas
turage continues good In most sections. In por
tions of the extreme south, artesian wells have
ceased flowing, and the water supply Is low.

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK. July 12.â stock market
showed continued strength and buying by pro
fessional operators was on a large scale. There
was a good demand from outsiders through
commission houses at the opening, encouraged
by the rise In prices yesterday and yesterday's
professional buyers were "free sellers to realize
while this lasted. The market then came to
the customary halt after such a p.ocess before
taking up an advance. An eager demand de
veloped for Missouri Pacific and affected nearly
all the Gould Southwestern group ln sympathy.
Not the stocks alone, but the securities of
this group of railroads were affected. Missouri
Pacific held the leadership of the market
throughout the day and made a late advance to
48%â an extreme rise of 2 points. The motive
of this buying was the Wall street rumors of
plans for merging the various railroad proper
ties in the Southwest in which the Goulds are
Interested. Good buying set In early for the
grangers, Pacifies and Atchison preferred, and
after midday New York Central was suddenly
pushed up an extreme 2%. Large buying of
Pennsylvania at an advance of 1% seemed to
be associated with the New York Central
movement, but later an attempt was made to
connect the latter with Union Pacific and
Northwestern by manipulating the price of
those two stocks. All of the Northwestern'
gain was subsequently lost. The manner ln
which the buying demand progressed through
the railroad list. together with the upward
tendency in sugar, prompted the professionals
to attempt a movement In the industrial stocks.
Leather preferred, Federal Steel, Tin Plate and
General Electric were bid up between 1 and 2
points, and New York Air Brake made a char
acteristic upward dash of 19 points.
Mexican Central rose quite conspicuously 2%
per cent under the sentimental influence of
the opening in New York of subscriptions for
the new Mexican refunding loan. Sugar. Man
hattan and Brooklyn Transit dropped sharply
from top figures and many of the gains in the
Industrials were practically wiped out. Prices
of the railroads sagged considerably from the
top and the closing of the market was de
cidedly heavy, net gains being only partly re
tained. The money market was easier to-day
and confidence is felt that the supply will be
come still more abundant at a very early date.
Total sales bonds, par value, $3,365,000.

the 3s registered %, while the old 4s registered

THE LONDON MARKET.
NEW YORK, July 12.â Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram says:
The markets here were Inactive to-day. They
opened dull, but Improved later on a spurt of
11-16 ln consols. The recent weakness in them
Is attributed to sales by discount brokers who
were unwllllnsr to pay the stiff loan rates de
manded by the banks. It Is rumored that the
proposal to extend postoffice savings bank in
vestments beyond consols has been abandoned.
A more hopeful view of the Transvaal situa
tion also prevailed. Money was harder. There
Is talk of an advance ln the bank rate to
morrow, but I think such action improbable.
Americans were buoyant, closing at the best.
New York bought freely and London is en
couraged by the crop reports, the St. Paul traf
fic and the news that grain rates are to be ad
vanced on August 1. Tlntos, 54%; Utahs, 8%;

good deal of buying from ' shorts, ' and support
from that source was â¢ permanent throughout

classes of traders to play for a rise from the
decline of the past three weeks. The demand
for wheat was taken up by those who sold calls
last night and by noon September was selling
at 73%Â®73%c. Crop reports were conflicting.
Nebraska reported 10.6 per cent of the crop in
that State worthless on account of the weeds,

HAY AND FEEDSTUFFS.
Arrivals of Hay were fair, but the demand
was active and sales were made at full prices.
Feedstuffa were unchanged.
The circular of Somers & Co. says of Hay:
"The market now shows some Indications of
the heavy receipts that, could be naturally ex
pected after the Fourth of July, although there
is yet a scarcity of men in the country to en
able shippers to bale their crop as they' wish.
This, together with the fact that many farm
ers are still busy with their grain, is keeping
much hay back that will probably be marketed
as soon as possible. We are Inclined to be
lieve, therefore, that toward the end of the
present month and during August, we may
reasonably expect very free shipments of hay
to this market Reports from our various
agents prove that there is a large amount of
hay throughout the country where there are
no storage facilities, thus necessitating the
marketing of much hay before the rainy sea
son sets in.
"Unless some unusual market Is developed
for our surplus, the future of the hay market
will be a very discouraging one. although we
may reasonably expect hay to advance dur
ing the winter months enough to pay for cost
of storing and insuring same.
"There is considerable discussion at the
present time as to the probable effects of the
Introduction of automobiles on the Pacific
Coast. If the horse is to be superseded by
these inventions, most raisers of hay will have
to enter a new line of produce raising. The
progress of the world seems to point toward
this Innovation, but the more conservative
think that It will prove but a passing fad or
fancy. In all probability two or three years
will solve the problem, although If this radi
cal change is to take place we will begin to
feel its effects very shortly."

AT AN ASYLUM
Doings at Agnews Are
Being Proved.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE. July 12.â Investigation
Into affairs at the Agnews Insane Asy
lum, arising out of the delicate condi
tion of Mrs. Wilhelmina Chaffers, an
Inmate, began this morning before the
State Lunacy Commission, sitting with
the local board of managers. There
ivere present Daniel Kevane. secretary
.if the State Board of Examiners, who
In the absence of the Governor is the
latter's representative; Assistant At
torney General Post; Dr. F. W. Hatch,
general superintendent of the State in-'
sane asylums; Charles F. Curry, Secre
tary of State; Major John F. Carrere,
secretary of the State Lunacy Com
mission. Or* the local board of managers
there were present Messrs. Hale, Up
lam, White, Greeninger and Curnow.
Aside from half a dozen newspaper
representatives there were no specta
tors. No new facts were developed in
the case. The testimony showed a
looseness in the method of canduc ing
the institution.
The first witness examined was Dr.
1.. E. Stocking, the first assistant phy
sician of the Institution. He testified
that Alexander 11. Underwood, the
basement man, had reported to him
about the 22d of October that an inmate
had seen Mrs. Chaffers helped through
the basement â¢ window by an inmate
employed ln his department named
Cooper. Dr. Sponogle was away at the
time, and when the medical director re
turned he reported the matter to him.
Dr. Chrystal followed with similar
testimony. Dr. F. W. Hatch told what
he had found out by questioning pa
tients.
Mrs. L. Bambauer, the matron,
gave testimony similar to Underwood.
Mrs. Z. B. White, in charge of the ward
svhere Mrs. Chaffers was confined, said
Mrs. Breemen had told her that Cooper
had helped Mrs. Chaffers into the base
ment and had also seen Cooper acting
rather free with Mrs. Chaffers.
Medical Director Sponogle was the
last witness of the day. He was ab
sent from the asylum between October
.'2 and 30 last. On his return home he
was informed of the discovery of Mrs.
Chaffers' visits to the basement to see
Cooper. He took no credence in the
story, but investigated the matter. A
month or so later a similar report, was
made to him. Although he placed no
credence in the story at that time he
Is now convinced that Cooper is re
sponsible for Mrs. Chaffers' condition.
He stated Cooper's mania was an alco
holic one and when sober he was per
fectly sane.
The Lunacy Commission held a short
executive session. Cooper was exam
ined privately and he denied the charge
In toto. Mrs. Oliver, sister of Bessie
Bailey, and several other inmates were
also examined. This closed the work
for the day, and the commission ad
journed until to-morrow morning at 0
o'clock, when more testimony will be
taken. The commission will undoubt
edly finish the work to-morrow-. Their
decision will probably be reserved for
some time.
Several stories smacking of politics
were afloat at the asylum to-day. One
is that Governor Gage intends to de
capitate Medical Director Sponogle and
make a place for a friend of Burns.
This is borne out some by questioning
Kevane, who is the personal represen- ,
tative of | the Governor. ..At several ;
times the 'questions were pointed.
One story is that Dr. Stocking will be
promoted to medical director, Dr.
Chrystal advanced to first assistant
and Dr. G. D. Marvin of Humboldt
County given third place. Marvin was
D the Assembly at the last Legislature
and ardently supported Grant for
United States Senator until the Sat
urday before adjourning, when he flop
ped to Burns. Now he is to be re
warded for this latter act. There are
also rumors that Stocking must go- be
cause of his connection with the Bessie
Bailey case.
DEWEY AND HIS MEN
QUARANTINED AT SUEZ
The Admiral and All Aboard the
Olympia Are in Good Health
and Spirits.
- SUEZ, July 12.â United States
cruiser Olympia from Colombo. Ceylon,
June 28. has been sighted.
Admiral Dewey said he was in very good
health. He appeared to be in excellent
condition, which was also the case with
his officers and men. Most of them have
suffered from malarial fever, but have
now quite recovered.
The Olympia has been quarantined, no
direct communication with the shore be
ing allowed. Consequently the represen
tative here of the Associated Press was
only able to converse with the admiral
from a launch alongside the cruiser. After
passing through the canal the Olympia
will .ill at Trieste. Thereafter the ad
miral's plans are uncertain. Possibly he
will go to Gibraltar and thence to New
York. _ ._ i
The Olympia has entered the canal.
LIVED ON BUT THREE
CRACKERS A DAY
SAN DIEGO, July 12.â Among the ar- i
rivals this morning on the steamer St. j
Denis from Ensenada were six passen
gers who left San Rogue Bay on the yacht
Rambler of San Pedro on June 25, and
who for fourteen days had been buffeted
about in midocean with only six days'
provisions to start with.
â¢ "We had calms and blows and head
winds and fogs," said one of the passen
gers "We left San RoquaÂ» with eleven
passengers and a crew of, three men un
der Captain Crosby, and had on board
provisions for six days.. We Intended to
make Ensenada, where we had to call
to get our -boat's clearance papers, or
otherwise we would not have been al
lowed to land in San Diego or at San Pe
dro, where the Rambler belongs.
"But the weather went wrong entirely.
For days we stood still. Then We were
hustled away out of our course by strong
but contrary winds. After a week had
passed our provisions ran short, and some
of us began to feel ugly. At last we
were reduced to three crackers a day.
Finch McKinney of Demon Grove was
among the passengers on the Rambler,
and his story of their experience is as
follows:
"Eleven passengers left San Rogue on
the Rambler," said Mr. McKlnney, "and
acting on the advice of Captain Crosby
we only took grub enough for five or .six
days, as he was certain we would reach I
Ensenada comfortably within that time.
All went well enough until we had been
nut six days and our provisions were al
most exhausted, and that day we sighted
land. The yacht's bow was turned in that
direction, but when the captain found it
was San Quintin Bay ho refused to go in,
but headed the vessel up the coast.
"He assured us we would reach Ensen
ada the same day, but It was the night of
July 9 before we again sighted land. The
vessel was run close in ,and then we dis
covered we were at D-scans- Bay, about
twelve miles -south of. the Mexican line.
For five days our only sustenance was
onions and water, and nearly all on board I
were suffering from starvation. The cap- |
tain seemed dazed as to what to do, and |
finally the passengers took charge of the
vessel and as the wind was favorable we â¢
returned to Ensenada," -:;â ,

the reports that he is about to resign
from the Cabinet. When asked as to the
truth of the rumors, the Secretary said:
"There is nothing in these reports but,
air " replied the Secretary. "I shall not
ret re this year, certainly, and cannot say
as to the future. My private business
and the state of my health will govern
my future course.
"These constant assaults and repeated
baseless reports are, of .course very an

to "my famllv; but I have never retired

so now Nothing that I have ever heard
of or known of has been- so cruel as the

have done that I ought not to have done,
or that I have not done that I should have
done-, I shall be very glad to surrender
my present official duties."

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JULY 13, 1899.
PRICE RETIRED
ON A PENSION
AT HIS REQUEST
The Disrated Sergeant
Gives Up His Star.
The Police Commissioners last night de
cided to retire Sergeant Price on a pension
at his own request.
Price was formerly a lieutenant of po- j
lice and was placed in charge of the J
Chinatown squad. Some time ago the I
Commissioners received information that |
he was not attending strictly to business, ;
and he was also accused of corruption.
After a lengthy Investigation the Com- !
missioners decided to disrate him, cvi- j
dently convinced that there was some j
foundation for the charges.
Price has been connected with the' de- j
partment for over twenty years: During j
that time he made a number of brilliant
captures. After being reduced to sergeant !
by the Commissioners he brooded over it, I
and frequently threatened to resign from
the department. He stoutly maintained |
his innocence and declared that not even ;
his bitterest enemies could prove that he j
had ever accepted a cent. while acting as :
head oft the Chinatown squad. Since he ;
was disrated he has been doing special I
duty for the Seventeenth Street Station.
Realizing that he is physically unable
to further perform the duties of police
man. Price last night sent in a written
request to the Police Commissioners ask
ing them to retire him on a pension. Chief
Lees, after the request had been read,
spoke of the excellent work done by
Price, both in Chinatown and in. the Mis
sion, and moved that he be pensioned, j
The Commissioners had no objection and â 
he was retired. !
When seen after the meeting Price said j
that he had asked to be retired as he did I
not feel that his position would allow- him i
to further continue as a member of the j
department. "-'- i- "â 
"It is not true that I was forced to re
tire," he said, "although I am satisfied j
that Commissioner Gunst and Lieutenant I
Esola have been striving to get rid of
me. Gunst is opposed to me simply for
the reason that I arrested one of his
friends some time ago. Esola has no use ;
for me because I refused to do his bid- |
ding in Chinatown. I. have served the
city for over twenty years and am glad
of "the opportunity to be retired on a pen- j
sion."
PRISONERS TORTURED TO
EXTRACT A CONFESSION
Six Suspects in Hungary Terribly
Abused Under Orders of the
District Judge.
NEW YORK, July 12.â A Sun cable
from Vienna says; Much attention has
been attracted by charges against local
officials at Mocsa. Hungary, accused of
torturing three men and three women
to extort confessions that they robbed
the communal treasury, a charge of
which they have since been proved in
nocent. The terrible details were not
revealed until now.
When the robbery was discovered the
District Judge ordered twelve ar
rests upon the most trifling suspicion.
One of the prisoners, Stephen Ko-vacs,
upon declaring his innocence, was or
dered to be tortured. His hands were
tied backward to his feet and the com
munal secretary, Melnar, thrashed him
on the abdomen and soles of his feet
until the cane he used was split, and
then the Judge trampled on him with
his spurred boots. Kovacs not confess
ing under this treatment, Melnar ig
nited some spirits and poured the burn
ing liquid over the prisoner's swollen
feet. '
The Judge struck him about the ears
until the unfortunate prisoner fainted.
When he came to, dreading further tor
ture, he said that he had taken the
money and buried it under a tree. A
search of the place designated by Ko
vacs did not reveal the money, where
upon his hands were tied behind his
back and he was hung up by his hands.
He a-ain became unconscious, but was
revived and again thrashed. Then Mel
nar thrust the blade of a penknife un
der his finger nails, causing him to lose
consciousness again. Subsequently,
he was kept without food or drink for
four days. y 9
Other suspects were, similarly treated.
Eventually a blacksmith named Todt.
who had not been arrested, confessed
that he was the thief and restored the
money. In the Hungarian Diet to-day
Deputy Pichler demanded that the Dis
trict Judge be thrashed to death.

Depreciation in Values the Most Fre

The Board of Supervisors sitting as a
Board of Equalization goes right along
listening to hard luck stories and grant

reason given for requests for reductions
is depreciation of property values and

ALAMEDA COUNTY NEWS.
IT MUST CARRY
THE COLORS OF
THE SANTA FE
*
The Streetcar System
Changes Hands.
. â Â» â
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, July 12.
The Santa Fe Railroad controls the vast
electric street railway system of Oakland.
j This statement was made to-day posi- j
lively by a person in authority to apeak. j
It settles the greatest question that has i
been agitated in this city for ten year* I
and insures a development for Oakland
which could never be obtained so long as
but one railroad company controls the
city.
' The recent visit to the coast of W. A.
Bissell. traffic manager of the Santa Fe,
brought out the fact that his road has al
ready considered the purchase of the little
California and Nevada road, which na_ a
valuable franchise from Bryants in Con
tra Costa County to Emeryville. The
Santa Fe, knowing that this road would
be of no value to any other -corporation,
has caused it to be known that it will not
purchase the little, road and carry the
bonds for several months yet.
The latest order of the Santa Fe au
thorities bearing out the statement that
they control the syndicate railroads lias j
1 just been sent out. It is ordered that all \
the cars owned by the syndicate shall be I
painted the same bright yellow color as
is used upon every passenger car of tho i
Santa Fe system from Mojave east.
When It was known that all the street I
cars of the live systems gathered in by
the syndicate were all to be painted the j
same color there was much dissatisfac- \
tion expressed by the people who use
them. The order, however, is unaltera- i
ble, and all cars must conform to the
Santa Fe pattern. So imperative is the :
order that many cars of the Piedmont
system, which had just been painted their
I old blue color, arc now being changed,
I and as soon as possible hundreds of yellow
cars will run all over the city.
Some New York financiers have been
identified with the syndicate ever .since
Banker Henshaw went East two years j
ago to lay the foundation for the con- j
solidation of the various systems then ,
existing separately. The consolidation was )
part of the plan to put the roads on such ;
a financial basis that they could be hand- |
led by the great railroad corporation
which has acquired the Valley Railroad I
1 and which will undoubtedly as soon as -
j possible connect its Point Richmond ttr- I
minus with its street system in Oakland. '
The Realty Syndicate, which also has
long had a New York end to it. has for i
three years been acquiring vast tracts of
land around Emeryville, where six years i
ago Frank M. Smith, the borax magnate '
and president of the syndicate, "built a
i very extensive pier, which- was to have
been the beginning of a ferry system to
San Francisco. Contracts were let at that
time for the construction of the ferry
boats, but the great financial depression
coming along at that time tied up F. M.
Smith and almost led to the bankruptcy
of the Santa Fe. These difficulties have
i long since been overcome, and now every
thing is in perfect shape for the carrying ;
| out of the great plan which was arranged
many years ago.
In view of all that is now known there :
| ran be little doubt that the Santa Fe will
j have a pasenger terminus at Emeryville
and that its vast system of street rail- I
roads will also be so handled as to cen
tralize traffic at that point, rather than
on Seventh street, where the Southern Pa
cific takes up all its passengers to San .
Francisco.

A Victory for Mills Seminary. i
OAKLAND, July 12.â Mills Seminary
has won a victory. Recently the old
Hotel Fontaineblcau In the hills near the
seminary was remodeled and changed its
name to the Hotel Stanton. Then It â¢
found a willing lessee in Joseph Bernard, '
a liquor dealer of Alameda, who Imme
diately petitioned the Board of Supervi
sors for a license to conduct a first-class
saloon at the Stanton. No sooner had
the ladies of Mills Seminary learned of
this than they set to work opposing the
granting of the license. As a result Ber
nard has been unable to secure the re
quired number of signatures to his ap- ,
plication, and now he declares he will
withdraw the same.

ROASTED TO A CRISP
IN A HAYRICK FIRE
HORRIBLE SUICIDE OF AN UNKNOWN
v N unknown man was roasted to death early yesterday morning in a
A hayrick fire on the Piedmont grounds. The Are was of his own making,
and from the material evidences was caused by the firing of a pistol a
hayrick fire on the Piedmont grounds. The Are was of his own making,
and from the material evldenct-s was caused by the firing of a pistol ln
' r~\ the hand of deceased. The haystack contained about twenty tons of
JL JL hay. all of which was consumed about the body of the unknown, burn
ing him to an Irrecognizable crisp.
The flames, which' lighted up the heavens for miles around, were first no
ticed hv Deputy* Sheriff Hitchcock, who was making his rounds on horseback,
at 2:30 a. m. He rode post haste to the scene of the conflagration, but not no
ticing that a human being was perched on one end of â¢ the straw pile, he
sought the aid of Charles Irwin, who lives In the neighborhood, to whom he
thought the hay belonged. Together with Irwin he returned to the sizzling
and crackling hay stack, and the two, assisted by a few others who had col
lected from the neighboring residences, attempted to cut short the mad career
of the devouring flames. They then saw the body of a man in the very midst
of the flames on one corner. of the stack. Hope for the unfortunate was. at this
time out of the question, for he was already a charred and shriveled corpse.
The pile of hay was burned to the ground. In the ashes were found a
scorched pistol, the frame of a pocketbook. a knife of good manufacture, a
bunch of four keys' and pieces of a stone liquor jug. Two of the cartridges in
the cylinder of the pistol showed the indentation of the hammer, and it is pre
sumed that they were fired with a suicidal intent. Three shots were heard just
before the fire was discovered. Miss Booth, the daughter of E. â. Booth, who
resides a few hundred yards from the location of the stack, heard three dis
tinct pistol shots, followed by the sound of crackling flames. All the cart
ridges were exploded, but there are hammer marks'on but two of them.
The body of the deceased was so completely destroyed that it was impossi
ble to discover whether or not any of the pistol shots had been effective In
producing death. The hay was the property of the Realty Syndicate. The
â¢geieral presumption is that the unidentiled climbed up the rick, set fire to It
with suicidal intent and then, to make assurance doubly sure, turned his pis
tol: upon himself. '

YOUNG LADY
KNOCKS OUT
RECTOR'S PLAN
Miss Brunker Is Not
Seeking Favors.
â Â« â
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway. July 12.
John J. Valentine is not yet free of the
Church of the Advent. The vestrymen
have refused to accept his resignation as
senior warden and are to make an effort
to have him reconsider. This was agreed
upon at the regular meeting of the vestry,
when many other amusing and intricate
problems came up for discussion.
It is a very hard thing to get rid of an
Episcopal rector when he is not willing
to be gotten rid of. Rev. Marshall Law,
although on a vacation with the under
standing that he must resign, and in con
sideration of the payment of $463 60 is still
the head of the church.
One of his parting schemes has been
frustrated by a young; lady. Miss Brunker
has formally stated that she will not ac
cept the rector's parting favor. She will
not attempt to succeed Air. Stalder as cus
todian of the Sunday-school funds. An
other little piece of Dr. Law's policy has
also been upset by the vestry. They have
refused to have Miss Stalder removed as
a Sunday-school teacher because she has
not been confirmed. Her father. Dr.
Stalder,' Is one of the vestrymen and the
rector thought to humiliate the father by
removing his daughter.
Then there are Dr. Law's debts. The
vestry discussed these very earnestly and
some one suggested that a little notice
disclaiming responsibility should be pub
lished, but this was voted down, although
the purport of it was communicated to
the rector's wife.
Another amusing Incident, very typical
of the rector, came to ligfif at the meet
ing. Three weeks ago The Call published
a eulogy from Choir and Nave written by
Dr. Law about himself, and it is now
known that five hundred extra copies of
this self-praise were printed and freely
distributed throughout the East. The bill
came in to the church last night and the
vestrymen declare they will not pay it.
They also passed a resolution declaring
that Choir and Nave does not represent
the church, that they will have nothing to
do with it and neither will they pay bills
for printing it.
The rector is now on his way East and
the last number of his magazine stated
that he would continue to write for it
during his "vacation.'' It is expected that
the next number will contain something
very vitriolic. .'â¢/'*> :! : .--
And all this petty politics and scandal
in the once . fashionable and wealthy
church which was proud to call John J.
Valentine its senior warden, and in which
John J. Valentine used to sit and read the
loud praises of himself sung by Rector
Law in Choir and Nave.'
Attempted Suicide.
Tom Dalton, a book agent who spends
his occasional hours of sobriety in ped
dling family Bibles, attempted suicide at
the City Prison last evening.
â¢ He was arrested "on Saturday on a mis
demeanor charge, and upon being taken
to the station was found to be suffering
from alcoholism. He was taken to the Re
ceiving Hospital and yesterday returned
to the jail. Last night as Turnkey Hlckey
was making his rounds he discovered Dal
ton jabbing himself in the neck with a dull
penknife. He had made several nasty
cuts, but failed to find his jugular. Hlckey
took the knife away and sent him to the
Receiving Hospital, where he was stitched
up. lie gave as his reason for his attempt
upon his life that he was tired of living
and disgusted with his Inability to refrain
from drink.

HAYWARDS MERCHANTS
WANT TO KEEP TRADE
OAKLAND, July 12.â merchants
of Haywards are determined to or
ganize an opposition to the system
being followed by Oakland merchants
to draw the trade of the interior
of the county to this city. A meeting
of the merchants of Haywards will be
held this week to consider the proposi
tion of organizing a local Board of Trade
for the purpose of taking steps to keep
their trade at home.
' The system to which the Haywards
merchants object came into vogue about
two years ago. It consists of charter
ing special cars on the electric road and
of bringing passengers into Oakland free.
The passengers are supplied with tickets
which -are redeemed at cost by the mer
chants with whom the passengers deal.
These excursion trains result in bringing
a large number of people Into Oakland
who undoubtedly spend much money at
the special sales. The Oakland merchants
declare that the people would come and
trade with them in any event, and that
it is not taking any more trade from the
outlying towns than has been coming
here since the electric road opened.
The Haywards merchants have been
discussing the matter for some weeks,
and while most of them are opposed to
it there are a few who say that the cus
tomers who go to Oakland are only those
who are not loyal enough to .their own
town to spend their money at home.

! twenty miles through the principal busi- ,
ness and residence streets of Woodland,:
thence to two or three of the largest vine- \

S M. Emery of Montana thanked the cit
izens of Yuba Cfty and Marysvllle for
their lavish hospitality.
President Stubbs of the association said
to-day: _, .
"Our tour of Inspection has so far been
beyond anything we had even dreamed of.
Not only have we had our first knowledge
of the true and limitless resources of Cali
fornia, but we have simply been over
whelmed with kindness and hospitality by
the people. To thank them for what they
have done for us is impossible. As a re
sult of this investigation I know Cali
fornia will feel a perceptible benefit in five
years and inside of ten years It will mean
millions to the State. The way we are
being treated by . the people shows that
they realize this. As a result of this In
spection the agricultural association will,
within the time I have specified, have
been the means of directing to California
thousands of people, who will come here â 
to make their homes and help upbuild the j
State For the first, time in the State s j
history California has unfolded to the |
representative men of every other State j
in the Union the true condition and re- i
sources of her limitless possibilities.'

SAN QUENTIN PRISON. July 12.â
While Warden Aguirre has been in office
i only twelve days he has exercised so much
I diligence in dealing with the opium traf
i fie that the result is a famine in that drug
' inside the walls. In order to make the
quantity the convicts now possess last as
I long as possible they have been driven to
I the expedient of using the narcotic by
i hypodermic injections, instead of eating
I it. The method employed by the '"fiends"
! Is remarkable on account of the fact that
iit entails bodily mutilation and severe
! physical suffering on the part of the user.
. Last night two guards whom Aguirre
\ had especially detailed to watch certain
| prisoners suspected of having opium in
their possession made a ! discovery that
; caused them to open their eyes in aston
-1 ishment. Two convicts in one cell were
i found busily engaged in preparing to use
I the narcotic, and their actions were such
1 as to cause the guards to keep quiet and
! watch proceedings. First. the opium, or
"hasheesh," as the variety used here is
I called, was mixed with water and placed
in a teaspoon. Then a lighted match was
i held under the spoon until the mixture
â  was warmed. Taking a small knife, on.'
'< of the convicts ba d his arm and, grit
: ting his teeth, thrust the sharp blade un
! der the skin, causing the blood to flow. A
I small instrument was then placed, in the
mixture in the teaspoon and filled, after
1 which the point of the instrument was
I inserted in the cut and discharged of its
: contents. This operation was repeated by
! the other prisoner, each holding a thumb
! over the cut until the drug had time to
i enter the circulation. '.
At this juncture the guards . surprised
! the "fiends" and captured the apparatus
l used to inject the drug. It proved to be
a small glass tube with a rubber cap on
! the endâ the kind used in filling a foun
i tain pen. The tip of this instrument had
been ground down until It was as sharp
!as a needle. The men confessed that they
I endured such suffering because they had
Ito husband their supply of opium. It is
! known that whatever quantity of opium
i an opium eater may use as a dose, just
I one-half that much is sufficient when used
1 hvpodermically. ___Â _*..'â¼'__
I The two men, George Wilson and Jack
i Ross, both serving terms for burglary,
were thrown into the dungeon, and their
cases will come up before the Prison
Board next Saturday.
POLICE OFFICER WARD
CHASED BY A BULL
RUNS INTO A HOUSE AND IS
MISTAKEN FOR A BURGLAR.
With Drawn Revolvers, . His Fellow-
Officers Charge Upon Him,
Only to Realize Their
Grave Blunder.
Policeman Edward Ward ot the South
ern Station is being congratulated by his
fellow officers that he is not occupying a
slab in the Morgue. Ward is one of the
most fearless men in the department, but
hereafter, so he says, he will not let his
courage, lead him into danger, particular
ly when a mad bull is on his trail.'
The other evening Ward, who was
chaperoning an attractive looking servant
girl across Brannan street, espied a vic
ious bull making for him. 5 - i
With a parting cry to his female com
panion Ward, who is not â¢ noted for his
fleetness, relieved himself of the extra
weight of his club and straightway made
for the doorway of a house on the oppo
site side of the street. As the maddened
animal headed for him Ward quickly
opened the door of the house and rushed
upstairs. One of the occupants of the
house an old womanâ he was a
desperate burglar, bent on killing her,
raised the window and lustily screamed
for "help. Another woman who was in
the house becoming alarmed over the
noise occasioned by the policeman falling
down stairs in his effort to escape from
the bull, procured a police whistle and
poking her head out of the window vigor
ously blew for assistance.
Several police officers who were at
tracted to the scene by the blowing of
the whistle, entered the house at this
juncture, prepared to make the battle of
their lives, if necessary, to land the blood
thirsty burglar. With drawn revolvers
they silently stole up stairs, momentarily
thinking that the desperate crook would
open fire on them. - â¢
As they crept along the hallway one of
the vigilant peace guardians heard a
noise in one of the rear rooms and con
cluding that he had discovered the burg
lar he signaled his comrades. With their
revolvers ready for action the policemen
threw open the door, determined to get
the bold house-breaker dead or alive.
Rushing into the room the officers dis
covered Ward seated in a chair, vainly
endeavoring to mop the perspiration from
his brow. _______
"Where's the burglar? asked the anx
ious policemen in chorus.
"What burglar?" inquired Ward, using
his helmet in the excitement for a hand
kerchief. â  * _.'__.__.__. .â¢"'*â *â 
"Didn't you hear about it?" again asked
the officers. . ' ... Â»..
"Say, are you guys getting crazy?'
angrily inquired Ward. "There is no
burglar here." - . ." - :
Ward then explained that he had been
chased by the bull and after rushing Into
the house forgot to tell the occupants
fhat he was a policeman in search of pro
tection. - -â¢
"I guess It's on us," chorused the gang
of disappointed "cops." "Let's adjourn
to the nearest brewery and talk it over."
And they did.

The amended petition will be filed by
the officers of the County Committee be
fore next Saturday.
The County Committee last night
adopted a plan of organizing district
clubs. The plan was prepared at a three
hours' session of the executive commit
tee yesterday afternoon. It will be noted
that five members are to be elected from
each club to constitute a central or ad
visory body. The advocates of the plan
to establish a central or governing club
maintain that the County Committee's
â work will be lessened by this form of or
ganization. It is further claimed that dis
satisfied Republicans, who may fanci-

that their grievances will not be heard
by the county committeemen represent
ing the Assembly districts, may get a
hearing and proper redress through the
advisory club.
Shortly after 8 o'clock T. L. Riordan,
chairman of the executive committee, en
tered the hall and Chairman Al Raisch
immediately called the committee to or
der. Thirty-eight members answered the
. rollcall, and after Committeeman Savage,
the restless spirit of the gathering, had
sought and received information upon a
few irrelevant points Mr. Riordan took
the floor and read the resolution agreed
upon by the committee on the new appor
tionment of the districts, which is as fol
lows:
Whereas, The Republican County Commit
tee here assembled Is representative of the
Republican party in the city and county of
San Francisco, and desirous of advancing in
fullest measure possible the best interests
of said party organization; and
Whereas, Said County Committee, in good
faith and tn full reliance of what appears
to be a legal right under the so-called
primary election law of California, did pre
sent to the Roard of Election Commissioners
of said city and county a form of ballot for
delegates to the Republican convention, to
â¢ be voted at the primary election, called for
August 8, 1899; and
Whereas, The said Election Commission
has so construed the provision of said law
as not to permit the voting of a ticket in
the form presented by this committee, while
holding that the only form of ticket per
â¢ missible under the provisions of said law Is
a ticket by Assembly districts based upon
the Republican vote cast in each of said
districts at the last general election; there
fore, be It
Resolved. That the Republican County
Committee does hereby cheerfully acquiesce
in the decision of said Election Commission,
and stands ready and willing to conform in
all particulars to the construction this day
placed upon said law by the legally consti
tuted Election Commission of the city ond
county of San Francisco; and be it further

Resolved. That the County Committee of
the Republican party do amend the petition
heretofore filed with said Election Commis
sion so as to provide for an apportionment
by districts of the 306 delegates provided
for by said petition according to the average
vote cast for the Republican candidates in

and be It further
Resolved. That the duly constituted offi

are hereby authorized and directed to file
with the Election Commission aforesaid an
amendment of the petition of said com
mittee heretofore presented, which will con
form in all respects to the declaration herein
expressed and to the decision and declara
tion of opinion this day made by said Board
of Election Commissioners.
All seemed to be favorably impressed
With the plan explained in the resolution,
and when it came to the vote it passed
with but one. dissenting voice, that of the
Irrepressible ' Savage. After, explaining
that he was "pretty well out of the gam<V"
Savage made a savage attack on what lie
pleased to style the manner in which the
committee was being driven, "driven like
dogs." he said. Chairman Raisch prompt
ly fell on Savage with a few sarcastic
warnings and Savage subsided. Work
was then proceeded with. Mr. Riordan
next read a resolution prepared by the
executive committee regarding the or
ganization of district clubs, which is as
follows:
The Republican party of the city and
county of San Francisco-, as here represent
ed hy Its legally constituted County Com
mittee, recognizes the necessity and pro
priety of uniting all elements of the party
in organized form for the advancement of
the party interest, and whereas a primary
election Is close at hand as preliminary to
the holding of the party convention and
the nomination of a ticket to be voted at an
election to be held pursuant to the pro
visions of the charter of the city and
county of San Francisco, and whereas the
Republican County Committee is charged
with the responsibility for the management
and direction of the affairs of said party;
therefore, be It
Resolved, That in the view of said County
.Committee it Is wise and proper that an
organization of the voters of said party
should at once be formed in each and all
of the Assembly districts .of said cltv ami
county, to the end that in the formation
of a ticket or tickets to be voted at said
primary election all elements of the party
may be consulted and a convention obtained
which will be fully representative" of the
wishes of the Republican voters of San
Francisco: and be it further
Resolved, -That in pursuance of this con
vention said committee does hereby call
for the organization in each Assembly dis
trict of said city and county of a district
Republican club to be representative of the
sentiment and wishes of the voters In each
of said districts; and be it further
Resolved. That each of the cluhs In the
various districts shall be formed at a meet
ing to be held in each of the districts of
said city and county on Friday, July 21,
1899, at 8 p. m. ; and further be It
Resolved, That . a general call for such
meetings shall be issued forthwith' by this
committee.' the meetings to be held in each
district at a convenient, point, to be des
ignated by the committeemen therein; and
further be it
Resolved. That the meeting in each dis
trict shall be called to order by the county
committeemen of said district, and at such
preliminary meeting permanent organization
shall be effected by the election of a presi
dent, secretary and an enrolling commit
tee of five members.
The roll of each, of said clubs shall be kept
open at a convenient place for six conse
cutive days succeeding said organization
during the hours of S and 10 p. m.
A second meeting of said clubs shall be
held on Friday. July 2*. ISM, at 8 p. m.,
and at such meeting each of said clubs
shall- elect five delegates to an advisory
central club, which shall be representative
of the district organization of the Repub
lican party of the city and county of San
Francisco, the term of such delegates to be
for one year following the date of the
election: and further be it
Resolved, That the delegates to said cen
tral club shall meet and .organize on
Wednesday. August 2. 1899. at 8 p. m.. such
.organization to he effected by the election
'of permanent officers, and the adoption of
such by-laws, rules and regulations as may
be necessary for the permanent maintenance
and government of said organization, as
representative of the organized masses of
the Republican party, in and for the city
and county of San Francisco.
A vote on the resolution showed not a
voice against ft and eulogies were in or
der. A. Ruef took the floor and after giv
ing his opinion that the blanket ticket
was legal and could bo forced upon the
â Election Commission It the committee saw
fit .aid he believed that as a matter of
policy the- scheme of apportionment 1.3
set forth in the resolution was a good one
and he approved of the plan. Committee
man Raisch spoke on the same lines, after
THE SAN FRAISCISCO CALL, ; THUKSPAY. JULY 13, 1899.
which it was agreed to notify each mem
ber of the committee by printed circular
the times and places the various clubs
would be organized. After this had been
agreed upon Savage requested that he be
furnished a Catling gun with which to
subjugate his party followers in his dis
trict under the lines laid down by the ex
ecutive committee. He was again quietly
turned down and the motion to adjourn
to the call of the chair prevailed.
BLANKET TICKET DEAD.
Kelly and Crimmins Turned
Down by the Election
Commissioners.
The Board of Election Commissioners
has unanimously rejected the Kelly-Crim
mins "blanket ticket" scheme and for the
gang which is attempting to dominate the
Republican County Central Committee
has laid down the one course of procedure
which is within the law and which will
be permitted to obtain at the coming
primaries.
Concisely, the commission has said that
delegates to the 'next convention shall not
be elected at large, but chosen upon tne
proportion of representation in each
Assembly district; that each district shall
have, and know, its own representatives,
and that the Western Addition shall not
be represented by the Mower of Brannan
street or North Beach heelers.
Furthermore, the commission has given
the County Central Committee, the Peo
ple's party and the Socialist Labor party
until Saturday to lose their "blanket
ticket" dreams and conform to the new
order of things in fresh petitions for
places on the ticket. â :,"-'
Messrs. Kelly and Crimmins did not give
up their gratt without a tight. It had
been conceded for two or three days that
the scheme was a dead one, but notwith
standing Al Raisch and Pat Prendergast,
to whom the light had been delegated,
worked on the commissioners from an
early hour yesterday morning - until
the time the meeting was called
in an effort to get them into
line. They were discouraged early in the
game and made a last desperate effort to
start things going their way when they
approached Commissioners ells and
Sheehan with a proposition to withdraw
the blanket ticket scheme if the board
would consent to allow the committee to
have seventeen delegates from each dis
trict without regard to party representa
tion at the polls. .
Wells and Sheehan were non-committal
on the scheme, as was Commissioner Til
ton, who was also approached, but Raisch
felt secure enough in the premises to.
make his proposition in open meeting
after the board had come together. He
let his gold brick lie on the table just
long enough to deliver a nice little speech
of withdrawal and another taking it all
back. . Tnen he picked it up and reverted
to the original propositionâ the blanket
ticket. The board went into executive ses
sion to consider.
Chairman Lane opened the meeting. with
a simple announcement of the reason for
it. Then he invited Mr. Raisch, to speak.
"When the Republican County Central
Committs- offered its petition tor the to
called - blanket ticket," said he. "it did
so in absolute good faith and for what it
considered the best Interests of the party.
"Since it was made public," continued
Mr. Raisch, "there has been so much crit
icism and censure; the press has objected
so strongly to the plan, that in order to
satisfy all the factions of the party we
now desire to recede from our position
and fall back on the alternative. We will
be satisfied with seventeen delegates, se
lected from each Assembly district."
That's where Mr. Raisch handed out
his gold brick. -' ââ_ 'â  ,
"That will give you the same 30b dele
gates; but do you mean to say that you
would give the Twenty-eighth District,
with 1000 votes, the same number of dele
gates that you would give the Forty-sec
ond, with 5000 votes?" inquired Lane.
Raisch replied that was precisely the
proposition, to which Lane retorted that
if he were a Republican he would not con
sider the scheme good politics.
That Raisch had merely put his propo
sition out- as a feeler became evident when
he discovered that the commission was
waxing not at all enthusiastic.
Attorney Archibald Barnard and Pat
Prendergast came to his assistance and
Barnard attempted to explain the rather
complicated figures by which their unique
table of representation had been arrived
at, but it was no go with the board. Lane
asked if they preferred that plan to pro
portional representation and. they said
they did. Lane said it was not witnin the
provisions of the law and asked if tne
committee would abide in the matter by
the decision of the board.
"We didn't say so," retorted Raisch,
and then he gathered in his brick again.
"Of course, it you gentlemen will not
grant the a'ternative pla_n we will not
withdraw our original petition. We want |
one or the other. We are willing to let
the 'blanket ticket' slide if you will con
sent to the modification we offer. If not |
we want it understood that we have not |
withdrawn our original petition."
Lane said he was not sure that the ,
board would accept either the original or
the modification, upon which Prendergast
came to his feet with the statement that i
"the members of the board had come to a
private understanding with him and had
agreed to the modification.
The only reply to this was a motion by
Auditor Wells to go into executive session..
Lyman Kinne of the People's party -and
Collins Gersford for the Socialist-Labor ,
party backed their petitions for blanket !
tickets, but the action of the board in
executive session pointed the way all of
them will be compelled to travel. The
resolution adopted unanimously was as
follows: :-'y.'-'>y.
Whereas Under the provisions of the pri
mary election law the Board of Election
Commissioners is required to pass upon pe
titions presented by various political par
ties for place upon the official ballot- to be â¢
voted at the primary election to be held :
in this city and county on Tuesday, August
8 1899; and whereas, under the law the ap
portionment of delegates for any territory
shall be upon the basis numerically of the
average vote cast for the candidates of the
respective petitioning political parties at
the last pre.edlng general election; and
whereas, any apportionment made in ac
cordance with the provisions of the law
must cot be to or the election by territory
not Included in the same Assembly district.
Therefore be it _.___.
Resolved. That all petitions presented by
political parties that do not conform to the
provisions of the law be rejected.
Resolved, That it is the decision of this
commission that the apportionment for each
territorial division shall be upon the basis
numerically of the average vote cast for the .
candidates of the respective petitioning po
litical parties at the last preceding gen
eral election, and the said apportionment
shall be in proportion to the number of votes
cast In said territorial division, which shall
not be larger than an Assembly district.
Resolved, That all parties which have not
complied with the law in the above respects '
shall be given until Saturday, July 15, at
11 a. m., in which to present said appor
tionment as they may desire in accordance
with the law. ... .' ; .-: :v -. v .'
Which is to say that the law Is to be
abided by and that the push that is doing
the embroiders' work for the Crimmins
and Kelly layout' has been given until
Saturday to do so. Under the provisions
of the plan laid down by the board if the
County Committee decides to stay by its
proposition of one delegate to every eighty
voters the number of delegates from each
district will be as found in the following
table: yW-^.

The Continental League, at a meeting
held last night at Saratoga Hall, 814
jeary street, Frank 'D. Worth In the
chair and Hamilton J. Rigglns secretary,
placed" Itself squarely on record as being
opposed. to the bosses.
Amos Currier, chairman of the execu
tive committee, offered a resolution in-.
SHE DIED FOR LOVE
THAT WAS SLIGHTED
Pretty Anita Byrne Ends Her
Troubles With Poison.
Brooding Over a Possible Dark Future Caused
Her to Seek Solace in the Great
Unknown.
er N a moment of desperation, due to the
threat of her lover that he was about
to desert her for another, Anita Byrne,
__ chief operator in the telephone office
at Sutter and Hyde streets, committed
suicide yesterday by swallowing the con
tents of a phial of carbolic acid.
Her mother discovered her lying en.-i
bale of hay in a barn in the rear of their
home at 16 Bourbon place. She was still
alive, but her condition indicated that she
could not possibly survive the fatal
draught. .Summoning a neighbor her
mother had her removed to the house. Dr.
C. C. Mohun was at once sent for, but
despite his efforts she breathed her last
several hours later. ''--.>
The man for whom the unfortunate
woman killed herself, so it is claimed, is
Frank Seaver, a switchboard attendant
in the main office. Seaver met Miss
Byrne about two years ago, while he was
acting as manager of the telephone office
at Sutter and Hyde streets. She fell des
perately in love with him and he seemed
to reciprocate ..her affections. Frequently
they were seen together, and among the
.other telephone girls it was whispered
that they were engaged to be married.
Tuesday evening Seaver met the mis
guided woman by appointment and they
went to Oakland. They returned to this
city about 10 o'clock and repaired to the
Byrne residence on Bourbon place. The
family had already retired tnd the couple
sat in the parlor for about an hour.
Seaver then took his departure, after
promising to sec Miss Byrne "in the near
future," as he expressed it. _Â; â ..-_...
Shortly afterward the unhappy woman
visited the room occupied by her mother
and. kissed her good night. It is pre
sumed she returned to the parlor, and
after brooding over her troubles deter
mined to end her existence.
Shortly before 6 o'clock yesterday morn
ing her mother awakened from her slum
bers and went to her daughter's room, In
tending to arouse her so that she would
not be late at work, as she was due at the
telephone office at 7 o'clock. After enter
ing the room she was surprised to find
it empty and the bed undisturbed.
After vainly searching the house for
her mis-sing daughter Mrs. Byrne, sus
pecting something had happened to her,
went to the barn, determined to make a
thorough investigation. As she threw
back the door she was horrified to see
her daughter lying on a bale of hay. fully
dressed and unconscious.
By her side was a half empty phial that
had contained carbolic acid. The usual
farewell message was not in evidence.
dorsing the action of the Election Com-
I missioners in discarding the bosses blan-
I ket ticket and providing for district rep
resentation at the coming primaries, by
which the Republican party can be fairly
represented in its selection of delegates
to the convention. : r :
To further show its hostility to the gang
that makes politics unclean. Dawson
Mayer offered a resolution setting forth
that the Continental League now as here
tofore, is opposed to bosses, and it will
do all that lies in its power to aid and
assist the Republican party to place good,
reliable men on the various tickets at the
coming elections, both for delegates to the
convention and for the various municipal
elective offices to be held under the new
charter. ; '- . ~
.Acting on the invitation of the Central
Republican League, President Frank D.
Worth and Secretary Hamilton J. Riggins
were elected as delegates to represent the
Continental League at the meeting of the
former league, which will be held- to
night at the Grand Hotel.
At the next meeting on August 1 a de
bate will be held as to the advisability
of San Francisco owning Its own gas and
electric lights and also waterworks. The
question will be discussed by Congress-

I the foolish woman evidently concluding'
I to die without acquainting the world with
the perfidy of her lover.
After learning the facts in the case Cor
oner Hill visited police headquarters and
invoked the aid of Captain of Detectives
Bohen in finding Seaver. He said he had
visited the telephone office, where he is
employed, but could get- no trace of him.
His object in asking the assistance of the
police in locating him was to hold him
until the inquest on the' body was held.
Coroner Hill Is of the opinion that
Seaver had jilted the unfortunate woman
and after brooding over his perfidy she
determined to die. r-io.?-
Mrs. Byrne, the mother of the young
woman, said last night that her daugh
ter had been enjoying a few weeks' va
cation from her labors in the telephone
office when she took the fatal dose.
"She seemed to regret that she had to
return to work," tearfully remarked her
fond parent, "as she feared that she
might lose her position for some reason.
She frequently spoke of the recent dis
missal of several of her chums from the
employ of the company and lived in fear
that she would be similarly treated. I
know she held Seaver in high esteem, but
it did not dawn upon me that she .was
in love with him." â .-'.' .*...-
The bottle of carbolic acid, the contents
of which the .woman drank, was pur
chased in Oakland.
Seaver was seen last night at the
Beresford Hotel, where he is stonpln- -
He had not heard of the' sad event and
was much affected when lnioimed-oi n-e
case. "Why, I left her last night at her
house," he said, "and there wasn't the
lease indication of anything wrong with
Miss Byrne. I am simply dumfounded: it
seems so impossible. We spent a pleas
ant evening in the company of her sisters,
and when I left her house at 11 o'clock I j
went directly home.
"My relations with Miss Byrne have al
ways been pure and honest. I liked her
exceedingly and we were more as brother
and sister. Now that this has happened \
I recall something her sister said to me
last night. During the evening in the
midst of a general conversation she told
me that Anita seemed blue; that she no
ticed her crying at times, refusing to ex
plain the cause. Last night Anita re
ceived a telephohne message from the of
fice, saying that she was to report to
day at 12. Whether it was this or some
thing else that worried her I do not
know. â '' â â ".'
"I can't understand for a moment why
she committed suicide," iterated young
Seaver. "We were always the best of
friends, and this is a deep- shock to me.
I swear that my relations with her were
none other than the most honorable in
the world." ';â¢; .:â¢â :; .';;.

envelope a page of a weekly paper con

president of the Wells-Fargo Express
Company, giving his opinions as to the

Mr. Munro had been asked on the pre

to the postoffice to be forwarded to United

had replied that so-called treasonable

that it was the province of the adminis

considered treasonable. . He had no juris
diction, he said, over articles criticizing
the Government, unless specially in
structed by the authorities at Washing
ton, and he bad received no instructions
on the subject. â¢ .. ;
Mr. Munro said yesterday that no one,
not even the Postmaster, had a right to ,
open a package. of first-class mail matter
and examine it to ascertain whether or
not. its contents were treasonable. Mail
matter of the first classâ that is, mail pre
paid with letter postage and sealed so
that its contents cannot be examined
without breaking the sealâ is immune
from molestation. All that Mr. Valentine
would have to do would be to ' seal his
articles in an envelope, put letter postage
on and address the letters to any one he
chose, and the local postal authorities
would be powerless to interfere. Even if
they knew that Mr. Valentine was the
author, they could not break open the
letters. All that could be done would, be
to hold the suspected letters in case the
postoffice authorities at . Washington
should so direct. - r
"Now that Mr. Valentine's article has
been sent to me." added Mr. Munro. "I
shall report to Washington for instruc
tions. I can do nothing of my own mo
tion."
Postmaster Montague said that if he
knew that articles of the kind mentioned
were being mailed he would take the re
sponsibility on himself and prevent them
reaching their destination. He would pre
fer, however, that the postal inspectors
should take the Initiative.
Going to Lake Tahoe To-MorrowP
The Friday to Monday Tahoe excur
sion tickets recently put on sale by the
Southern Pacific afford residents of
Sari Francisco, - Oakland, Alameda and
Berkeley an unparalleled opportunity
for an enjoyable and diversified outing.
Two days at that famous mountain
resort and a steamer trip around the
lake at the small cost of $10 80 is an
opportunity which the traveling public
should not- fail to take advantage of.
Remember the train leaves San Fran
cisco at 6 p. m. on Fridays and returns
on Mondays.
