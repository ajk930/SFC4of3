Venezuelan revolutionists under Castro are now marching toward the capital, where there is considerable excitement
and apprehension.
CARACAS, Venezuela, Sept. 17.â
President Andrade has returned
to this city after his disastrous
defeat at the hands of the revolu
tionary army under Cipriano
Castro. The latter continues his victo
rious advance, and has reached Mara
cay.
The Cabinet is doing everything pos
sible to prevent bloodshed in Caracas.
There is great excitement. The Eng

CLOUDS OF WAR AGAIN
HOVER OVER TRANSVAAL
LOXDON. Sept. 18.â All dispatches
from South Africa this morning
talk of the imminence of hostili
ties and the preparations for
them. In Johannesburg it seems
to be taken for granted that the Orange
Free State has approved President
Kruger*s not and promised active as
ristance in the event of war.
An official telegram posted at Volks
rust says that the Transvaal, with the
assent of the Orange Free State, repu
diates British suzerainty and adheres
to the seven years' franchise.
At Cape Town it is reported that Mr.
Hofmeyer, the Afrikander leader, sent
a communication to President Steyn of
the Orange Free State, entreating him
to do his utmost to preserve peace, but
that he received in answer the words:
"Too late."
All military men agree that it is out
of the question to begin hostile opera
tions before the middle of next month,
no rain having fallen and the veldt be
ing still bare.
It is supposed that the next move
contemplated by the Transvaal is an
appeal to the powers, begging them to
recommend arbitration on the lines of
the conference at The Hague.
There was a serious* disturbance in
the market square of Johannesbure on
Saturday afternoon, a. meeting called
by a labor agitator named Bain to con
demn the British policy and to enroll
volunteers to flf*Â»t for tho Hoprs led to
serious fights with the police, lasting a
couple of hours. Many persons were
injured, among them the recently noto
rious Dr. Matthews, whn made a charge
against a mounted policeman. An im
mense crowd, singing "Rule Britan
nia," accompanied him to the police
office.
LONDON PRESS THINKS
BOERS MEAN TO FIGHT
LONDON, Sept. 18.â The Morning
Post says: "The Boers mean to fight.
That is the plain English of it."
The Standard says: "The Transvaal
note is unsatisfactory, and, indeed, a
dangerous composition. It might be go
ing too far to say that the last hope of
peace has vanished or that diplomacy
has said its final word, but it idle to
deny that the rulers of the Transvaal
have brought their country very close
to the brink of a disaster, which the
British Government has done its best
to avert."
The Dally Mail says: "President
Kruger's defiance ha 3 terminated a
long period of unrest and uncertainty
in South Africa, for, whatever may be
the issue of the present situation, one
thing 1b certain that dualism in South
Alrica will en<t- forever."

The Daily Chronicle says: "We re
gret that the Boers, by rejecting a
fair offer made in fair language, have
taken a line giving fresh points to the
argument of their enemies that Presi
dent Kruger is a shifty and imprac
ticable politician, fit only to be spoken
to across a line of bayonets." '
These extracts fairly represent press
opinion in London. All the papers
characterize the attempt to represent
Conyngham Greene as suggesting the
Transvaal's former proposals as mere
shifty prevarications.
The Pretoria correspondent of the
Morning Post in his summary of the
Transvaal's reply, says the Transvaal
I repudiates suzerainty and the right of
I interference, and denies that either
State Attorney "Smuts or the Govern
ment offered a five years' franchise

adds: "The reply anticipates a final
alternative of a British note by saying
that further suggestions on the line in

The Cape Town corespondent of the
! Daily Mail says: "Afrikanderbund cir

Commissioner, in reply to a correspond

; Orange Free State which would justify
hostile action on the latter's part, and
expressed the opinion that it would be
equally contrary to international law to

j manding British subjects to guard the
i Basutoland border."
EVASIVE REPLY OF
BOERS TO GREAT BRITAIN
LONDON, Sept. 18.â The reply of the
Transvaal to Mr. Chamberlain's latest
note is said to cover nine pages. It is
eminently of the "negative and inclu
sive" character which Mr. Chamber
lain declared would compel the imperial
government to consider the situation
afresh. It practically repudiates suze
rainty, reverts to the seven years'
franchise and declines to give equality
to the Dutch and English languages in
the Volksraad.
In short, it is politely negative and
defiant. The full text may not be
available for a day or two, but It will
not change the aspects of affairs. The
Cabinet will probably meet on Wednes

PRETORIA, Sept. 17.â The reply of
the Government of the South African
republic to the latest dispatch, dated
September 12, of the British Secretary
of State for the Colonies, Joseph Cham
berlain, after acknowledging the re
ceipt of the British note, proceeds in
part as follows:
The Government deeply regrets the
withdrawal, as the Government under
stands it, of the invitation contained in
the British dispatch of August 23 and tha
substitution in place thereof of an en
tirely new proposal.
The proposals, now fallen through
contained in the Transvaal dispatch of
August 19 and August 21, were elicited
from this Government by suggestions
made by the British diplomatic agent in
Pretoria (Conyngham Greene) to the
Transvaal State Secretary <I<\ W. Reitz),
suggestions which this Government acted
upon in good faith and after specially
ascertaining whether they would be likely
to prove acceptable to the British Gov
ernment. This Government had by no
means an intention to raise again "need
lessly the question of its political status,
but acted with the sole object of en
deavoring by the aid of the local British
agent to put an end to the strained con
dition of affairs.
This was done in the shape of a pro
posal which this Government deems, both
as regards its spirit and form, to be *:>
worded as relying upon Intimations to thia
Government would satisfy Her Majesty's
Government. This Government saw a dif
ficulty as to the acceptance of these pro
posals by the people and legislature of the
Transvaal and also on account of a sin
cere desire to secure peace and because
assured by Mr. Chamberlain that such
proposals would not be deemed a refusal
of his proposals, but would be settled on
their merits.
As regards the joint commission, the
Transvaal adheres to me acceptance of
the invitation thereunto given by Her
Majesty's Government and cannot under
stand why such commission which before
was deemed necessary to explain the com
plicated details of the seven years' law
should now be deemed unnecessary and
why it should now, without much in
quiry, be thought possible to declare this
law inadequate.
Further, there must be a misappre
hension if it be assumed that this Govern
ment was prepared to lay proposals for a
five years' franchise on a quarter repre
sentation of the new population before the
Volksraad for unconditional acceptance
As to the language, this Government
never made any offer such as Is referred
to, considering, as it did, such a measure
both unnecessary and undesirable.
The proposed conference, as opposed to
the joint commission of inquiry, this Gov
ernment is likewise not unwilling to enter
upon, but the difficulty is that an accept
ance thereof is made dependent upon the
acceptance, on the side of the TranÂ«vaal
of precedent conditions which this Gov
ernment does not feel as liberty to submit
to the Volksraad and. moreover, the sub
jects to be discussed at the conference re
main undefined. This Government
ardently desires and gladly accepts arbi
tration, as its firs intention is to adhere
to the terms of the London convention of
1884.
The dispatch concludes by trusting
that the British Government on recon
sideration may not deem it fU to make
more onerous or new proposals, but will
"adhere to Great Britain's proposals for
a joint commission of Inquiry as pre
viously explained by the Secretary of
State for the Colonies to the Imperial
Parliament."

I Cartervllle was the scene of a
I bloody riot between white and ne
y^j gro miners to-day. Six negroes
were killed and one other mortal
ly wounded. Company C, Fourth Regi
ment, I. N. G., arrivtd here late this
evening and will endeavor to preserve
order. Forty miners from the Ilerrin
mines left that place for this city this
evening armed with Krag-Jorgensen
rifles, determined to assist the white
miners should their services be re
quired.
Trouble has been brewli. ; ever since
the militia was recalled by Governor
Tanner last Monday. sine* which time
the white miners have refused to allow
the negro miners to come into town.
To-day thirteen negroes marched into
the town and opened fire on a crowd of
whites. The whites returned the fire
promptly :.nd a running tight ensued.
The negroes, closely followed by the
whites, scattered, some running up the
main street and the remainder starting
down the railroad track. Here the
worst execution was done. After the
' fight was over four dead bodies were
| picked up and another mortally wound
i cd. They were taken to the City Hall,
where the wounded man was given
medical treatment and an inquest was
held over the dead ones. Later, near
the brush mines in another part of the
city two other dead bodies were found.
The killed:
R2V. O. T. J. FLOYD.

JOHN BLACK.
HENRY BRA NUM.
TWO UNIDENTIFIED.
Mortally wounded: Sim Cummings.
The Mayor has taken every precau
tion to prevent further troubles and
none will occur unless the negroes
make an attack.
Superintendent Donnelly of the Brush
mines, where the negroes reside, re
ports that the negroes are worked up
into a frenzy and that while he is do
ing all in his power to hold them in
check he expects further trouble.
Late to-night Governor Tanner re
ceived the following telegram from
Sheriff Gray of Carterville:
Company C has reported to me. The
situation is critical. There are many
armed men in Carterville and in the vicin
ity of the Brush mine. The military com
pany is not sufficient to disperse the mob.
Governor T_nner telegraphed Sheriff
Gray as follows: "You sha.. have all the
force necessary to enforce the law and
b Ing the guilty parties to justice."
MURPHYSBOKO, 111., Sept. 17.â One
of the t".ead negroes at Carterville is a
preacher, the others are laborers. One
of the negroes when first shot started
to run. He was shot again and fell.
One of the white men then ran up and
shot him through the head with a rifle.
The shooting took place immediately
in front of Mayor Zimmerman's house
and in full view of several ladies seated
jon t"..e porch. Before the noise of the
first shots had died away the streets
began to fill with excited, armed men.
After the crowd of negroes had been
killed and scattered it was the evident
intention of the infuriated miners to
gc to Gre'^ville, where the big non
union negro camp is located, and finish
the worl-. All the afternoon an anery
crowd of men patrolled the streets.
Later the projected trip to Greenville
was apparenti called off.
SPRINGFIELD, 111., Sept. 17.âGov
ernor Tanner has ordered two compa
nies of the Fourth Regiment, under
command o" Colonel Bennett, to Car
terville. The Governor gave out the fol
lowing statement to-night:
I received a message from Captain
Brush, owner and manager of the mine at
Carterville, stating that a mob had at
tacked and killed five of the negro miners
while waiting at the Illinois Central de
po'. for a train; that the Sheriff was un
able to control the situation and was
powerless to arrest the parties, asking me
to order troops to Carterville, and that he
had ordered his men to stay on his
ground.
In response to this message, knowing
some of the conditions of that place and
without waiting to hear from the Sh-riff
I ordered Lieutenant Lowden of Company
C of Carbomiale to proceed at once to
Carterville, preparing a special if neces
sary, and when reaching Carterville to
suppress the riot and protect litV and
property, but report to the Sheriff of
Williamson County for orders, in the
event that the Sheriff was on the gmuni-l
I also ordered Captain Hersh of Coin
\ pany B of Newton to proceed with his
1 company by the quickest route to Carter
ville, and to report to Colonel Bennett for
riot duty. At the same time I ordered
Colonel Bennett of the Fourth Regiment
who lives at Greenville, to proceed to
Cartervlle at once and take charge of the
troops. I also directed the commandinK
officer of Company F of Mount Vernon to
prepare to be in readiness to move on
short notice.
At 4 o'clock, two hours from the time
I received the message mentioned from
Captain Brush, I received a message from
Lieutenant Lowden, of Company C, of
Carbondale, stating that he would leave
on a special train for Carterville at 4
o'clock this afternoon. Later I received
a meÃsage from Captain Brush stating
that later reports showed that six of his
men were killed and two injured and that
a large armed mob of men was between
Carterville and his mine and that one
company was not sufficient.
This 13 a blot on the fair name of the
commonwealth or' unrnli and will be a
disgrace to. the community of Williamson
County, unless quic. and vigorous action
is taken by the county authorities. The
good and law-abiding citizens of William
son County should rise to the situation
and support the officers in restoring peace
and order and in the arrest and eonvic
i tion of the guilty parties. I hope that the
Newton Company will reach Cartervilie
before morning and before any conflict oc
curs, but I do not believe and .5,,a1l not
believe until it happens, that the strikers
will attack the National Guard or at
tempt to oppose it in doing its duty.
JUSTICE THROTTLED
BY A BIASED JUDGE
Magistrate Rodden, Caught at His Game,
Attempts to Destroy Evidence Against
Himself,
SAN RAFAEL, Sept. 17.â Justice
of V.:p. Peace G. Rodden is making
an effo: . to use his office to pun
- * ish those with whom he has had
personal differences. If this mag
istrate were given a free rein no man
who engendered his displeasure would
be safe. In his hands the machinery
of a court of law is a dangerous weapon
with which it appears he would not
hesitate to punish the innocent ormulct
the defenseless. The measure by which
this Judge deals out law to the unfor
tunates whosj unlucky star leads them
to his court is the quesion of friend or
foe. And woe to the foe who falls into
the clutches of Justice of the Peace
Rodden. To such the wheels of his
court machinery turns to grind their
very bones. No quarter is shown.
They are enemies of the Judge and Jus
tice is not for them.
The Call has caught this tyrant in
the very act of condemning a defendant
who had not been given a hearing; of
preparing to punish a man who in the
eyes of the law is innocent of crime,
because he has not been proven guilty;
of sealing the fate of this man, so far
as lay within his power, before he had
been given an opportunity to be heard
in court.
Citizens of Marin County, how does
such a picture strike you? Those of you
who are lovers of liberty and upholders
of the law, how do you fancy the idea
of liberty and law being throttled by
an unscrupulous, venomous person who
has wormed himself into office upon the
pmmise that he would deal out justice?
| Those of you who take pride in your
j county, can you look your fellows
squarely in the face when the proof
goes forth that no man's peace or hap
piness is safe in your midst who has
caused the displeasure <- " your town

Caught at his work this man

fangs and deprived of its venom, and
then sought to cover up his tracks by
a clumsy effort to mutilate the records

from a document that proved his unfit
ness to preside in a court of justice; to
conceal the evidence which showed him

is concerned in is that Perkins is
charged with a crime before a court
where all the laws of the land, where
the princioles that form the founda

to expect justice and the distinction of
being considered as innocent of crime
as the unborn babe until his guilt is

Perkins has not been tried. No evi

It is well to note that the name of
John D. Spreckels is not mentioned in
the Rodden decree. Rodden had no
acquaintance? with Mr. Spreckels and
they have had no personal differences. [
Rortden wrote the words quoted
above. When cornered he confessed i
that .the indorsement of .Perkins' pre
sumed guilt was a little premature,
and then blurted out like a spanked
schoolboy that Perkins had not treated
him fairly; that he had caused to be
printed things that pricked the thin
Rodden hide. He admitted his ani
mus. This was the reason he had
jumped at the opportunity to try th 3
Perkins case. It was his chance to get
revenge on a presumed enemy, and it
appears that this is the Judge's highest
idea of the purpose of his court.
Driven into a corner this person took
refuge toehind the childish explanation
that he had written the telltale words
before he realized that Perkins had not
been held, and claimed that they were
of no force and did not foreshadow his
final decision br ause he had not ap
pended his signature..

When representatives of The Call in
timated to him *hat it was the inten

matter, Rodden ran his pencil through
the writing, and later when tha news
paper men were absent he made an in
effectual attempt to erase the inscrip
tion.
Two Call reporters and a photog

ing: and requested permission to in
spect the complaint. It had been in-
I spected previously, without the knowl
edge or consent of the Judge, and a
I copy made of the inscription that was
to condemn Perkins to the Rodden
punishment.
The Judge was docile until the words
that show his bias were turned to.
As the newspaper representatives in
spected them closely he was visibly
agitated. He turned pale and began
to tremble like a man with the palsey.
From appearances he fully appreciated
that he had been trapped.
"We would like to photograph this,
Judge."
Heavens! That was too much. Pho
tograph it! Never! Negatives do not
lie. Rodden grabbed the document from
one of the reporters and held on to it as
though it were a priceless treasure
that was about to be wrested from him
by the unfeeling newspaper men. No
amount of argument could turn him
from his determination to conceal from
the public the evidence of his incapa
bility an< of the fact that his official
head should be unceremoniously sev
ered from the rest of his being.
He claimed that his office was closed
on Sunday and that therefore the pa-
per was not a â nubli^ document and
could not be inspected any further.

BURGLAR CAPTURED
BY A PLUCKY GIRL
Miss Lucy Frank Levels a Pistol at a Ma
rauder and Holds Him at Bay
Until Aid Arrives.
liRAfS VALLEY, Bept IT. â Nevada County has a heroine of whom j
it may well be proud in the person of M!ps Lucy Frank, the pretty 18- J
year-oW daughter of John Frank, an industrious farmer of Rough and â 
Ready. !
About midnight last night the young lady was awakened by the \
barking of dogs and listening intently thought she heard footsteps. !
Then all was quiet until about 2 o'clock, when -he was again awakened i
by the dogs barking. She got up and looked out and heard a noise like |
the drawing of nails. Concluding that there was a thief in the corral, '
the brave girl called her father to accompany her, and arming herself ;
with a revolver, started toward the corral, her father following her. i
They heard a great sputter among the fowls and upon examination !
found a hole where boards had been torn from the chicken house. The !
fearless young lady stepped into the building and leveling her gun at the '
thief told him to surrender or she would shoot. !
The burglar, realizing that to move would be to meet his fate, threw j
up his hands. Mr. Frank then procured a rope and the marauder was
bound hand and foot. While the girl watched her prisoner Mr. Frank j
got a neighbor to come to this city for an officer. j
Constable Townsend arrived about daylight and brought the man to <
jail. The prisoner is an Austrian by birth and gave the name of Louis j
Reinsta4ler. j
The Call people that I do not want to
try this case any more. I will not ob
ject to having It transferred to any
other court. I don't like it any more
no, really I don't. Tell themâ tell
them that I will not feel put nut a bit
if they ask for a chance <>f venue. Do
me the justice to tell thorn that." The
pleadings of the aged Judge, caught at
last in his prostitution of justice, was
pitiful. He fairly whined himself into
tears, but steadfastly refused to allow
a. photograph to be taken of the docu
ment.
"I might do this for any one else but
The Call," he continued, "but that pa
per has not treated me right. It has
printed things about me that I did not
like and I do not think that I owe it
any courtesies."
Again the Judge showed by his own
words and actions that his personal
feelings were the only power that
moved the machinery of his court. It
â was explained to him that The Call
did not ask for any special favors or
anything that the law did not give it a
right to demand.
While this conversation was going on
the Judge spread the complaint before
him, and carefully ran his pencil
through the writing that was by this
time giving him so much uneasiness.
Even though it was Sunday and his
court closed, according to his idea, he
did not hesitate to alter the records.
"There, now." said he, when he had
finished the job, '"that settles it. You
see I have rubbed it out and that ought
to satisfy every one concerned." And
this with a look of innocence
that would have made an angel blush.
He thought that the faint waving
lines would obliterate his bias in the
eyes of the public.
Rodden finally sparred for a little
time to catch his breath. Rumor in
Fan Rafael has it that the Judge ad
mires and fears the clans Coehrane,
and visions of their displeasure prob
ably flitted across his troubled mind.
"I will consult an attorney," said he,
"and in two hours I will let you know
if the document can be photographed."
This was the first surrender, but h^e
fore the day was done the Judge had
made many.
Jumping into his buggy Rodden
drove out on to the Petaluma road in
the direction of the fochrane domi
cile. One of the clan Â«is an attorney, j
His brother is the complaining wit
ness in the libel case against Perkins.
If any further explanation is necessary
The Call is ready to make it.
The Judge returned to his office be
fore the appointed time. He improved
the occasion before the newspaper men
arrived to still further mutilate the
complaint. The faint pencil lines were
Increased to huge black marks that al- j
most blotted out the entire writing, i
With the writing hidden beneath his
Inartistic daubing the Judge felt that
he had baffled the camera.
Willingly he permitted the photo
grapher to get a focus on the front of
the document. When the camera was
turned on the Judge's inscription his
heart failed and he ran a mighty and a
desperate bluff. He grabbed the paper
again.
"You fellows can't bulldoze me," and
he feigned anger while the tremor !n
his voice indicated fear. "You can't
photograph that. I have marked it out
and it is no longer a part of the record.
"What do you want it for, any how?"
"Judge," was the reply, "we charge
you with altering and mutilating a
public record. That is why we want
the photograph. You attempted to de
stroy evidence against yourself when
you ran your pencil through that writ
ing this morning. That is all we desire

PEOPLE ARE STARVING
TO DEATH IN PONCE
Belief Sent by the Government, but
Temporary and Commercial
Conditions Must Change.
Corrpspondence of the Associated Press.
PONCE. Porto Rico, Sept. 11.â People
are starving to death almost every day
In the city of Ponce, anil while this sad
state of affairs exists there Is a failure
to afford commercial relief, which Is the
only true and lasting relief. Unless a per
manent government is established, unless
the status of the island is determined, un
less the policy to be followed here in the
future is soon outlined, existing conditions
â will be aggravated, and it will soon be
necessary to feed the whole population
through relief agents.
What Porto Rico wants, however, is not
charity but rather the development of
her commercial and agricultural Inter
ests, and while the present distribution
of relief Is necessary that necessity would
soon disappear if these interests were
properly cared for. Great difficulty has
been encountered in transporting the sup
plies to the inland towns, largely due to
disappearance of the bridges. More than
this, when the Panther arrived In the
harbor of Ponce the sea was rough and a
great quantity of the provisions brought
by the steamer dropped into the" sea in
stead of reaching the lighters. Fifty per
cent of -what was originally landed was
damaged by water and had to be thrown
away.

Subterranean Fac-Simile of the Stable

Other Points Excellently
Shown.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Sept. 17.â One of the
most remarkahle religious Institutions in
the country, the Monagtry and College
of the Holy Land, established by the*
Franciscan friars of the Holy Land, was
dedicated to-day with imposing- cere
monies, in which Cardinal Gibbons. Mgr.
Martinelli. Bishop Hlenk of Porto Rico,
Mgr. Stephan. head of the Indian mis
sions in this country, Mgr. Sbnrettl. Audi- j
tor of the papal delegation in WasHing- j
ton. and many other prominent figures of
the Catholic Church participated. During
the afternoon a flag-raising gave a na
tional and patriotic phase to this exten
sive undertaking. The institution is situ- .
attd near the Catljollc University on an
eminence commanding a view of the
beautiful university grounds.
A special branch of the Franciscan
order for centuries has devoted its entire
attention to the preservation and pro
tection of the tomb of the Savior, the
stables of Bethlehem and othor sacred i
relict oi the life of Christ. As many j
American* are Joining the pilgrimages to
the holy relics it has been deemed advis
able lo establish in this country a college
which will prepare those who will j
carry forward the work of pre-
Bervation. To this end a com
missariat of the Holy Land .for
th*' Tnited States was located in New
York In 1880, and out of this has grown
the magnificent structure dedicated to
day with it? subterranean reproductions
of "the stable at Bethlehem, the home of
the holy family at Nazareth, the holy
sepulcher and other monuments of
Palestine. These- have been executed
under the direction of the foremost
ecclesiastical architect of Rome. Slgnor
LJanori, who visited Bethlehem. Nazareth
and other sacred spots, making measure
ments and laking note of Btone and
structure in order to make a taithful
counterpart of the precious relics. The i
work has proceeded with the special i
favor of the Pope.
One of the grottoes, representing the in
ner ami outer sepulcher of Christ, has a 1
. ... of actual Btone of the sepulcher, j
brought from Palestine by special dispen
sation. At another of the subterranean;
shrines the remains of St. Benedigaa will |
be deposited. They are being brought ;
bj one of the friars of the order,:
and will find a final resting place in a
glass catafalque, after the manner adopt- j
ed in Europe to permit the observation of l
holy relics.
The reproduction of the stable at Beth
lehem is perfect in every detail, with the
small Btone manger in which the Christ
child was born and the defacement which
modern vandalism has wrought. In the j
reproduction of the holy sepulcher both j
the outei sepulcher, where the angel sat, j
and the inner sepulcher. from which the
aiiKt-1 rolled back the stone, are shown.
The inner tomb shows the great marble
slab placed there to keep the Turks from
desecrating the tomb, and the slab bears |
even the irregular crack of the original.
The main work of the friars is carried
on in the monastery, a space separated â 
from the shrines and chapel and devoted |
entirely to the members of the comma- ,
nity. "On the lower floor are cobbler .
shops, tailor shops, laundries, etc., con- j
ducted by the friars, who make every- ;
thing needful for their simple manner of '
living. The upper part of the building is |
used for living quarters, each member of j
the community having a cell with the
plainest and simplest furnishings. It is i
considered the most austere of the active
orders.
The church connected with the mon
astery is a massive structure in the
Bhape of a five-fold cross, with many
altars and chapels. The European meth- |
od has been adopted in the interior of
the church, so that those who come to i
worship will stand or kneel, as there are
no seats. The interior is bo. vast that it j
is expected to celebrate mass at several ,
altars simultaneously, and the devotion
of the sacrament will be practically con
tinuous up to midday.
The order of exercises began with
solemn dedication at 10 o'clock this
morning. Cardinal Gibbons conducted the
ceremony. There was a procession of sev
eral hundred members of the clergy, re
ligious students and friars. At 10:30 pon
tifical high mass was celebrated by Most
Rev S. Martelli. the apostolic delegate to
the United States. The sermon was
preached by Very Rev. L. F. Kearney,
provincial of the Dominican Order of
Columbus. Ohio. At 3 o'clock solemn
pontifical vespers were celebrated In the
alverno chapel. At 4 o'clock the patriotic
exercises closed the day's ceremony.
The institution begins its work with
about fifty friars in attendance, most of
them from this country, although a few
come direct from the Holy Land.
HARSH PUNISHMENT
INFLICTED BY OTIS
Imprisons a Private Merely Because
the Latter Wrote a Letter to
the General.
SPRINGFIELD, Ohio. Sept. 17.â Through
Governor Bushnell the harsh and unusual
punishment, wholly contrary to the spirit
of American institutions, inflicted on
Lawrence Hoon of Belle Centre, a town
twenty-live miles north of here, and not a
private in the Fourth United States Vol
unteers in Manila, is up before President
McKinley for action.
The treatment accorded Hoon, who is an
exemplary young man, has aroused a
wave of "indignation all over the State.
His offense, for which he has been dis
honorably discharged and sentenced to
one yCBJ in BiUbld prison, consists of
having addressed a letter to Commander
in-Chief Otis, asking for permission to
try an examination for a lieutenant's
commission.
Hoon did not know that, according to
the military code in force in Manila, it
was a crime for a private to address the
commanding general without the permis
sion of somr intermediate officer.
Hoon's father is dying and the disgrace
heaped upon his son. whose crime was
ambition to serve his country well, has
affected him seriously. Governor Bush
nell, who has written President McKinley,
expressed himself to-night in the most
vigorous language about the matter.

Will Afford.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Sept. 17.â Speculators
declare that the prices of seats for the
Dewey land parade will be higher than
they are now quoted, despite the fact
that almost fabulous prices are .being
paid for windows and small rooms on
the line of parade.
This is specially true of Fifth avenue,
where it will cost a party of six up
ward of $100 to witness the demonstra
tion from a private window. There are
not many vacant places in the vicinity
of the Dewey arch in Madison square,
and the prices demanded and received
for available accommodations are said
to be record-breakers.
Among the leases that have been an
nounced is one for a room in the
vicinity of Fifth avenue and Twenty
sixth street large enough to accom
modate a party of twenty for which
$500 lias been paid. Within a few doors
of this location another room, having
but one window on Fifth avenue and
large enough to accommodate fifteen
to twenty persons, has been rented for
$800. Ordinary single windows on Fifth
avenue near Madison square are selling
for $50 each, and it is said that one
firm of speculators has offered the
owner of a Fifth-avenue building $3000
for window privileges. This building
is four stories high.
Three of Fifth avenue's most notable
landmarks are being turned into sight
seeing spots for the celebration. The
old Delmonico building at Fifth avenue
and Twenty-sixth street, the Alexander
T. Stewart mansion at Fifth avenue
and Thirty-fourth street and Sherry's
old place at ' Fifth avenue and Thirty
seventh street all have been turned
over to speculators. No stands have
been erected in front of Delmonico's
old place, but the Stewart mansion is
being inclosed with stands and a large
stand "has been erected in front of
Sherry's old place.
Sousa says he will get together the
greatest and best body of musicians
ever assembled.

point to one of the most successful meet- 'â 
ings of recent years. Six clays' excel- â

the pavilion show is one of the best ever
placed in the big building, where so many
excellent displays have been made.
The city begins to look like it did in
the old fair times when farmers had
plenty of money and spent it freely. In
one sense the town has been thrown
"wide open." Hunter Square, just oppo-
Bite the C'vurt House, Is covered with
fakir shows and the sportive characters
who drop in will not have to look far to
find a game to their liking. There has
been no objection yet against the loosen

eral feeling seems to be that so long as
the law is not brought into open disrepute
considerable latitude will be allowed.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON. Sept. 17.- Notwith
standing repeated denials, rumors of an
extra session of Congress are persistent
ly circulated. Public men who are
closest to the President declare that he
has no thought of calling Congress to
gether before the regular time for its
assembling on the first Monday in De
cember. Mr. McKinley hopes that by
the time Congress meets in regular ses
sion he will be enabled to announce some
substantial progress in the Philippine
campaign and hold out hopes of an early
settlement of affairs in those islands.
As General Otis will not have a greatly
increased force at jiis disposal before the
latter part of October, it is not expected
that he will be able to accomplish much
in the way of subduing the Filipinos he
fore the middle of November. The Presi
dent hopes, however, that by the Ist of
December he will be able to report to
Congress a marked Improvement in the
situation.
EIGHT KILLED BY
A FALLING ROOF
Adobe House, Weakened by Bains,
Collapses at Moran, New
Mexico.
LAS VEGAS, N. M., Sept. 17.â An adobe
house five wiles from Moran, N. M., col
lapsed last night, killing Manuel Cordova
and his wife and six children. It had
been raining in that vicinity for several
days, and the dirt roof of the house hav
ing become saturated, it fell upon the In
mates, crushing them. Only one member
of the family, a boy of 10 years, escaped,
he being outside the house when the acci
dent occurred.
MANY MINERS IDLE.
Scarcity of Water in Tuolumne River
Causes Hardship.
JAMESTOWN, Sept. 17.â Over 500 men
have been laid off during the past ten
days by mining companies in Tuolumne
County on account of the Tuolumne
County Water Company's supply giving
014. The Jumper Company has laid off
145. the Consolidated 130 and the Eagle
Shawmut 100.
While these big companies still retain
a considerable force developing new
ground, many of the smaller mines have
closed down entirely. Local comment is
excited by this annual closing down,
which has a depressing effect on busi
ness throughout the county, and people
are unable to understand why capitalists
do not construct a reservoir in the higher
Sierras of sufficient capacity to insure
water for mining purposes the year
round. On Friday the electric power
company closed down its plant, and
Sonora. Jamestown and Stent again use
coal-oil lamps instead of electric lights.

Mrs. Angle La Rue and Engineer
;W right, who lost their lives in the ter
rible wreck on tile Southern Pacific at
Famoeo station, cwecty miles north of
here, ca the night of September 13.
Quite a l.umber of spectators were
present in the courtroom to witness
the proceedings and catch the details
iof the horrible affair as they dropped
from the sober Upa of the train crews
that were in the wreck. These people
are dissatisfied at the result. They do
not think aH the facts were brought
â¦out to properly place the blame of the
'â¢destruction of four lives. The Coro
ner and District Attorney are held re
sponsible for this apparent negligence.
Some are so radical as to say the jury
â¢wao "packed" in the interest of some
oody. Dissatisfaction *-aa precipitated
at the failure to have the agent at Fa
inoso present to tell what he knows of
what happen**! just preceding the
â wreck. It was to him Conductor W. A.
Kessier of the Fortervilie train applied
for orders as soon as his train reached
Famosa station, and it was he who toid
Kessier that passenger No. 3 had orders
on reaching Famoso; at I 1) o'clock, to
wait for an easxiwund extra freight to
pass.
It is also the agent's duty to handle
the semaphore, which the Porterville
crew claimed showed a red light and
the passenger crew claimed showed a
white light. Red means to stop and
white means to go on.
Conductor Kessier asked that this
agent be brought co testify, and also a
witness who hud Srtn Engineer Wright
stupid from drink the afternoon before
the wreck. This witness is T. A. Schee
-1-r, a San Francisco drummer. Schce
ler, Kessier sa.ys. saw Wright that aft- I
ernoon at his hotel seated on a chair J
lookiz-g like a drunken man, in Kern, j
Scaeeler was '-in the wrecked passenger j
train. Coroner Buckreus informed i
K-ssler that it was too late; that he j
should have seen that his witnesses i
-were summoned before. The Coroner '
finally left the matter to the jury, and
it decided that neither the station
agent at Famosa nor Scheeler's evi
dence was necessary to enable them to
reach a verdict. The verdict was then
rendered.
For some reason District Attorney
Ahem was not present. He left the
case in the hands of his deputy, Mr.
Dorsey, an inexperienced and very
young man. This was a subject of
While Mr. Dorsey interrogated the
witnesses a Mr. Eiagby from the South
ern Pacific claims department sat by
ijlr. Dorsev and whispered questions to
jhim to propound to the witnesses. J.
:F. Ford, a Porterville attorney, was
â  rres-rnt to re-present the Interests of a
'friend of the dead women.
Drs. Snook and Taggart. surgeons,
â who were called to the wreck, were
'first to testify. They told of the con
'dftian in which they found the dead
and injured. Charles Heman and Un
â  dertaker McCabe of Porterville identi
?Sed the dead women. Then Conductor
- "W. A. Kessier of the Porterville train
-crew took the stand. Conductor Kess
â  Ur said his train, consisting of nine cars
i and a caboose, arrived at Famoso sta~
rtlon at 3:20 en the evening of the wreck.
: He stopped on the main line and went
into the depot to report au * get orders.
He inquired if No. 8 was on time. The
?a:rÂ°nt replied: "It is late and has orders
;to wait here at 10 o'clock for an extra
-eastboun-i freight to pas;." Kessier
ithen went out. The train was put on
:the house track an., the engine was
'taken to the water tank and to the
ftum table.
On returning the switch was thrown
,at the north end and the caboose
â¢-"kicked on to the main line, just far
'enough to clear the switch where it

pared watches and it was then i:4o. ;
According' to the time table No. 3 was :
due at 5:42.
"When the caboose was kicked on to I
the main line," said Kessier, "I looked j
and saw the headlight of No. 3. I j
started to riag it and saw my brake- \
man, Mr. Buck, running down the
track to do the Sagging. The semap
hore board was red. I thought they
would stop and went to my caboose :
and started to get on. Something at- j
tracted my attention and I turned and
saw No. 3 right en me. I plainly heard :
the engine exhaust. It was only about
fifty feet away. The engine was ap- j
parently in wide open, forward motion.
I just barely had time to get out of j
the away when the caboose was struck, j
After the wreck I met Conductor Cul- ;
linghani of No. S and asked him if he :
had orders to wait at Famosa for the j
extra east freight. He said he had not. j
I asked why Wright did not see the sig- i
nals. "You know Ed can't see,' was his
reply. I asked my brakemena if Wright â 
had room to stop. He said he had.
" 'How do you account for him not j
stopping?" I askjpLl He replied: 'I
guess it was a cas*Bt boose or bowling â¢
up.' When Buck began to nag. in my |
Judgment. No. 3 was two miles down i
the track. He went about 1000 feet I
from the caboose. It is customary to !
work under the agent in the yard lim- j
its. We were doing this. Then his :
orders are superior to regular rules. !
and an inferior is supposed to clear the i
track ten minutes before the coming ;
of superior trains. At the time the ca- ;
boose was struck we were on the main !
line six minutes over the regular pas- ;
senger time."
Engineer Elwood of the Porterville
train." who has run an engine for eight- â¢
een years, testified that the Porterville !
train reached Famosa at 9:25 , five mm- j
utes earlier than Conductor Kessier j
=aid it arrived.
Aside from this his testimony cor- j
roborated Kessler's as to other d-taiis. |
Brakeman K. B. Buck of the Porter- |
rfHe train corroborated the rest of the j
witnesses. He toid how he tried to flag j
No. 8 and how the semaphore light was â 
red and that he had no other idea but j
that he could stop No. 3. He was the ;
first to see the headlight and at once 1
w-?nt to Hag the passenger. He be-
Ueved had Engineer Wright seen the I
signals hÂ» could have stopped the train. j
There was no whistle for the station, i
Rear Brakeman Thurman of Porterville â¢
told of putting lights on the rear ca- I
boose and about the three women and ;
the trackwalker getting on the caboose. !
He heard the orders about No. S being j
late. Ke saw the semaphore red light j
up.
Conductor James Cullingham of No. j.
3 swore that at Kern he only got two j
orders. One was to wait there till two ,
freights arrived and the ocher to side- !
track at Jew^tta station, midway be- i
tween Kern and Famosa. and allow No. j
3 to pass. This they did. When leav- !
Ing Jewetta they were about thirteen i
minutes behind and made rapid time \
to catch up. The train whistled for Fa- ;
mesa.
"We had nothing to stop for." he said. ;
'â¢Famosa is a flag station and we do
not stop,unles? we have orders. When
the train whistled it began to slow j
down. I saw the semaphore was white, j
I toid Conductor Kessier that Wright j
could not see well. I don't think Wright ;
was drunk. We were running about j
forty miles an hour when the wreck I
occured."
Fireman Keller, who was with En- j
gineer Wrizht when the wreck oo- I
curred and who saved himself by-
Jumping through the side window as
the engine went over, testitied that they ;
never saw any signals. They whistled
for the station and when he first saw
the semaphore it was red, but just be- ;
fore reaching it the white light dropped :
i and the red disappeared. The train â 
was going about fifty miles an hour. !
It slowed up a little when the whistle j
! sounded. Ke saw the tail lights on the ;
1 caboose.
Brakemen Bunger and Ki^ger of the !
passenger train heard the train whis- j
tie and felt it slow down considerably, j
1 It was running at the rate of twenty- :
i eight or thirty miles an hour when it 'â¢
struck the caboose. Eunger saw the
semaphore white and saw no signals. I
Mr. Bagby, the Southern Pacific j
j claims agent, was heard to reply in [
answer to a remark that the wreck |
would cost the Southern Pacific Com- i
| pany considerable, "Oh. they were old I
! people and not worth much."
Just before the jury was left alone j
to make up the verdict Conductor !
Kep.sler was seen talking with one of,
them. The jurymen told Kessier not j
|to worry about the agent's testimony â j
he would be treated fairly; and Kess- j
: ler's saddened face looked brighter, i
â  Outside a citizen was heard upbraiding j
; a juror for not seeking more facts and !
thereby have a clearer investigation.
The Juror replied: "Oh, we did not |
want to fasten the blame on any one i
in particular; we did not know what \
â¢ to do."

The Consul said he attributed the
whole ' trouble to the fact that the
present squad was not w*jll posted in

by those from whom they received in
fo rmaticn.
The matter will be officially laid before
Chief Lees and he will be requested to
have it investigated and the trouble to

The orations were of the historical â *

president of the day. Mr. Truman â *
spoke very briefly, pointing out the les- -â¢

quartet sang sweetly "Lead Kindly â *

pronounced the eulogy upon Gartieid. <
"So long," said Mr. Kahn, "as the |
people of this land keep alive the idea

ATTORNEY LANE`S BRIEF.
Response in the Charter Election Suit
to the Claims of M. F. Fragley.
Franklin K. Lane. City and County
Attorney, will file his brief to-day in. the
Supreme Court In the case of M. F.
Fragiey va. James D. Phelan et al. The
appellant seeks to enjoin the Board of
Election Commissioners from calling or
holding an election in accordance â with
the provisions of the new charter, on the
ground that the election of December ST,
IS3T. when a Board of Freeholders was
chosen, and the election of May >". 1898.
when the proposed charter for the city
and count; was approved, were invalid
and void because of certain irregularities
in holding- the -.true.
Mr. Lane makes these contentions:
The vote at either election would have
been the same had all things been done
the omission cf which are criticized; no
voter was misled by the Election Ccm
missicners or other officials â . 5 to the
time of election or place fixed for vot
ing: every elector having 1 had an op
portunity to vote, that fact validates the
charter elections: voters received proper
notice that the election would take place:
there is no allegation that every qualified
elector did not have a chance to vote,
nor is It alleged that a single vote was
refused; or that ire was not a sufl
ciency of polling- places; the election hav
ing been free and fair.
A mistake made by the Election Com
missioners as to the law under which the
election should be held does not dis
franchise the voters: if the voter can
not rely upon the acts at the Election
Commissioners there would be no se
curity in the ballot; polling places were
fixed by the proper board, due notice was
given, and the voters voted thereat only;
there were sufficient election S3 Era to
do the necessary work: if called by
proper authority an election held, in
conformity with the provisions of an un
constitutional law is not necessarily
void: it is now too late to attock the
validity of the elections mentioned in
the foregoing, because the charter has
now become law by act of the Legisla
tare, and the steps leading thereto are
no longer open to question. Equity will
not be' blind to the hardship of an ad
verse decree, the people having acted
throughout in good faith.

STILL BUYING RIGHT AND LEFT.
ATTENTION ha? been frequently called of late,
to the surprise <n' commercial authorities, that the
general and sometimes slurp advance in prices
the United States has in no wise checked
the demand Buying in all sections is reported as
lively as ever and the advance in quotations has thus
far produced no effect whatever. Evidently the pur
chasing limit of the people has not yet been reached
and the fears of the aforesaid commercial authorities
not been realized.
\ good illustrai the enormous volume
in August, according to the monthly statistics
just received: "Exports were $20 ,082,815 larger than
ever before in August and exceeded imports by $37,
--partly because exports of staples were $9,366,
--978 larger than last year, but also because exports of
Other products, mainly manufactures, were $10,349,000
larger than those of last year, and larger than in any
: of any year." In fact, the business of the
country this year has never been equaled.
Of course, there must be a pause some time, for this
enormous purchasing of merchandise cannot go on
forever without cessation, and when that pause will
come and in what shape is a question now bothering
the heads of financiers. The great staples continue
highly profitable point, both to the producer
nufacturer, if we except wheat, which remains
comparatively low in consequence of good crop pros
pects. Purchases of wool are large, but somewhat
stive. The iron trade is still exerting itself to
fill all orders, but finds it impossible, and many are
perforce refused. Woolen poods are strong, but man
rs are complaining that the advance in the raw
material has outstripped that in the manufactured
t, thereby cutting down profits. Coal oil has
made several advances of late, largely on account of
the rise in tin, and hides and leather are enjoying a
kf-en and continuous demand at very firm quotations.
in gone up at several centers and the
is seemingly as sharp as ever. Cotton has
I off a fraction, owing to good crop prospects,
r the refusal of spinners to believe otherwise.
I ) sh<nv the effects of overproduction
is brick, though it would seem that lumber and brick
to go hand in hand to a considerable extent.
tics, on which financiers base their
views on the state of trade, continue encouraging. The
country's bank cleafings last week were 28.7 per cent
larger than for the corresponding week in 1808, and
not a single city of importance in the whole country
showed a decrease. The failures were 149, against 174
last year, both records being small.
The local situation stands about the same, being
characterized by a fine home demand for all sorts of
goods and a demand for export which cannot wholly
be filled, as it is in excess of the tonnage available to
take the merchandise away. The call is general and
embraces lumber, groceries, canned and dried fruit,
beef and pork and their products, clothing, etc. The
vineyardists are smiling over a sharp advance in wine
grapes to $20*023 per ton here, which means $17 50(0)
20 in the country, though the admitted shortness of
the crop will cut down the gross proceeds materially.
P.nyers are scouring the country for grapes at the
high prices. The output of canned fruits has unfor
tunately been cut down about 25 per cent by the recent
scarcity of tin, but even with this drawback the fruit
grower has nothing to complain of this year. Unless
present conditions be overturned by some now unfore
seen commercial check the current fall trade will be
the largest for many years, if not, indeed, the largest
ever known.
Sir Thomas Lipton is to decorate his yacht with
i electric lamps upon the occasion of Dewey's re
turn. Even these will not afford a strong enough
light to enable him to find the cup.
It is admitted in the dispatches that there are a good
many "amis" at the Chicago trust conference. It
will undoubtedly develop later that there are also a
many grannies.
The people of San Domingo have money to burn
since the success of Jimenes as a revolutionist. Mer
chants there refuse to take paper currency.
STAND BY THE PLEDGE.
TO-DAY is the day set by law for the Board ot
Supervisors to fix the rate of the tax levy. The
Mayor, the Board of Supervisors and the Mer
chants" Association will all have something to say in
the matter, and it is expected that whatever is done
will be for the best interests of the whole city.
For months the question has been discussed, not
| alone by the officials directly interested but by every
[ head of department and every taxpayer in the city.
\ The amounts which should be given to the various
' departments have been adjusted and readjusted, and
1 there has been a constant difference of opinion regard
, ing the most equitable distribution, and following this
divergence there has always been the paramount ques
â  tion of whether or no the city of San Francisco can be
run on a $i rate on the $100 with a total vaulation of
$300,000,000.
Both political parties in convention said that it could
be done, and the candidates of those conventions were
; pledged to see to it that the dollar limit was not ex
; ceeded. The Mayor and the various speakers of both
parties on the platform during the campaign preached
the doctrine of a dollar limit, and in every instance the
candidates pledged themselves before the people to
maintain it.
; It is now time for the question to be officially set
j tied. The city departments may suffer because of a
! shortage of funds, but it is the duty of the Supervisors
!to stand by their pledges. A majority of the board IS
! Republican, and The Call calls upon those members to
i stand by their party's pledges and let it be shown
\it this city can be run on the dollar limit. Every
i member of the board should stand by the pledge, and
j at the same time deal fairly with every department, in
: such manner that the adjustment will not bring hurt
] to the city.
The Call has reason to believe that the members of
! the Board of Supervisors will stand by their pre-elec-
I tion pledges, and the people will then have an oppor
tunity of knowing just what will be the result of an
: attempt to bring the levy down to an arbitrary point. ,
The Republican members especially have a duty to
perform to-day, and it will not do for them to heed
the cries of poverty and raise the assessment, thus
I giving the Democrats an opportunity of saying that
; had they been in control the dollar limit would have
been adhered to. If any member of the Board of Su
pervisors now goes back on his pledge he will do so
'. at the risk of bringing down upon his head the con
! demnation of those who were cajoled into voting for
him by his pre-election pledges.

A BOSTON VIEW OF IT
V reason of the fact that New England ha? cer-
Btain large interests which can be promoted by
Canadian concessions the press of that section
is inclined to favor the pretensions of Canada on the
Pacific Coast. Indeed, some of the leading New Eng
land papers seem disposed to grant whatever the Ca
i nadian Government may ask in Alaska, provided it
yield in return what New England desires.
An illustration of this peculiar way of looking at the
issues at stake between the two countries is afforded
i by the comments of the Boston Herald on the Alaskan
boundary controversy. It begins by saying the Cana
dian authorities have a reasonable desire to obtain an
: ocean port for their Northwest Territory; that if we
j occupied the position of Canada we should make
most urgent demands for accommodations of that
kind, and that "on the ground of international comity
! it can be fairly urged that this is a concession on our
part which can be reasonably asked for and reason-
I ably accorded." It then adds: "The ground for ob
! jection on this side of the border is based almost
] wholly on the selfish interests of three or four Pacific
! ports that now have a species of monopoly in the out
\ fitting of miners going into the British Northwest
: Territory."
Having laid down those propositions the Herald
; goes on to say:
"The question of our relations with Canada should
I be treated not by the desires of local or special inter
': ests, but on the ground of broad national considera
tions. The Canadians have a great market, the larger
part of which we now possess, and which we not only
want to keep but to materially increase in the future."
There will be no objection to the statement that our
! relations with Canada should be treated on broad na
tional considerations, but few people outside of New
i England will deem the retention of our Alaskan pos
| sessions unimpaired a local issue. If there be any
I such thing as a national policy, it surely must be that
j of protecting and maintaining the boundaries of the
! republic. The local interests in the case are those
i vhich New England would like to advance at the ex
j pense of surrendering a part of Alaska to the Cana
| dians.
Such selfishness as appears in the argument is not
!on the side of the Pacific Coast. The demand of the
! Canadians for an Alaskan port appears to our Boston
i contemporary quite reasonable, but what would it
I think if Canada should desire a port on the coast of
! New England?
THE ARMY IS NOT FRANCE.
LOUD was the outburst of popular indignation in
this country over the second condemnation of
Dreyfus and for a time it seemed we were about
to act against a whole nation with as much prejudice
as the French are said to have acted against the ac
cused. In Chicago one large establishment dis
charged all of its employes of French birth, and from
one end of the Union to the other there arose a wild
demand that the French exposition be boycotted. The
passion of the day, however, has already passed and
the people look at the issue with a better understand
ing and a more reasonable judgment.
It was in fact a foregone conclusion that the clamor
against all France and all Frenchmen would not long
continue. The American people may not be by nature
more just than other people, but by reason of the fact
that nearly all great questions are in some manner sub
mitted to their judgment they have become accus
tomed to act from reflection rather than impulse and
to look at things in the light of common sense. They
are hard-headed, practical business people and excite
ments do not carry them off their feet nor last long.
Thus it has come about that they have revised their
first passionate judgment of the case and are now pre
pared to give to the French people that justice they
demand for Dreyfus.
The conviction of Dreyfus was brought about by a

few officers of the army, and not by the French peo
ple. It is not the army that is going to hold the expo
sition, nor is it the army that is going to profit by it.
The Parisian mobs that clamored for the conviction
of the Semite do not represent all Paris. Labori, De
mange, Zola, Picquart, Jaures and other supporters
of Dreyfus are representatives of a strong element of
the French people, and they have stood out bravely
for justice. It is clearly foolish to condemn a whole
nation on an issue of such a kind under such circum
stances. Our sympathies will be with the brave band
of truth-speakers in France who have so long fought
for justice against prejudice, and we will not by de
nouncing the whole nation make their task harder by
giving to them the appearance of acting with for
eigners against their own country.
COLMA is to be congratulated upon the victory
achieved by her business men and taxpayers
over the gamblers who have been seeking to
incorporate the district for the purpose of making it a
place where their poolrooms could be run wide open.
The plans of the gamblers were cunningly devised,
and but for the exposure of them by The Call and the
earnestness with which the genuine residents of the
district opposed them they would have been successful,
and that attractive suburb would have been converted
into a resort for all the rabble of touts and toughs
that follow in the wake of gamblers.
The benefit accruing to San Francisco from the
resolute action of the good people of Colma is hardly
less than that which has been obtained for Colma
itself. The establishment of a wide-open gambling
center so near to the city would have been almost as
pernicious as was the notorious gambling carried on
at Ingleside. The temptations to the unwary, which
were so strong before, would have been renewed, and
we should have had repetitions of the old stories of
women as well as men led to ruin by the evil influ
ences of the poolrooms.
Now that the victory has been gained it behooves
the people of Colma to be careful lest the beaten en
emy steal a march while no one expects it. The profits
which would accrue from a gambling place of the kind
which was designed for Colma are large, and will be a
continual temptation to gamblers. They will not give
up trying so long as a chance for victory remains.
They may next turn their attention to some other dis
trict of San Mateo. In any event, the people must
continue watchful and wary.
TAXATION IN WASHINGTON CITY.
rOR years past the cost of maintaining the ad
ministration of Washington City has been
borne equally by the citizens and by Congress â
that is to say by the taxpayers of the rest of the United
States. At the last session of Congress it was pro
posed to compel the city itself to bear the whole bur
den of the cost of opening and improving the streets
when extended into the suburbs. Against that plan
a vigorous protest has been issued by the Washington
Board of Trade and in. the argument of the protest a
good deal of interesting information has been given
concerning the economic conditions of the city.
It appears in the first place that hardly more than
half of the property in Washington is subject to as
sessment, nevertheless so high is the assessment that
in 1890, the census year, when the count showed that
the taxes fell upon a population of less than iÃg,ooD,
the assessed valuation exceeded the combined assess
ments of Cleveland, Ohio; Portland, Or.; Dcs Moines.
Iowa; Kansas City, Kans. ; Sioux Falls, S. D.; Chey
enne, Wyo. ; Fargo, N. D.; Tucson, Ariz., and Vir
ginia City, New, with an aggregate population of 437,
--339 â between two and three times as large as that of
Washington.
In San Francisco we 'demand the dollar limit and
consider our tax burdens intolerable when that
sum is exceeded to any considerable amount, but
the people of Washington, in addition to their high
assessment, have an invariable tax rate of $i 50 on
every $100. It is further noted that in matters of tax
ation Washington is at a disadvantage with other
cities, inasmuch as thousands of persons who own
real estate there and live there claim residence else
where, and whatever personal taxes they pay are paid
where they technically reside. This state of things
grows out of the peculiar status of Washington as a
political and not a business city. A very large propor
tion of her population go there to serve the Gov
ernment in some way, and this gives them a right,
under existing law, to claim their old homes still as
their residences. They cling to the right because it
is the only condition of their having a vote.
The fact that so large a proportion of the inhabit
ants of the capital claim residence elsewhere has -a
political as well as economic effect on the city. It
is that more than anything else which deprives the
community of the advantages of self-government, for,
as it is said, since so many of the intelligent citizens
would have no right to vote there, the political control
of the district would pass at once into the hands of the
irresponsible class if popular government by ballot
were established.
One of the leading men of the capital is quoted as
saying it would be possible to get rid of both the
disfranchisement of the District and many of the evils
of the spoils system by the simple device of a law re
quiring every person accepting employment under the
Federal Government in Washington to become a resi
dent of the District pro tempore. According to hi 3
argument, if every Government employe in Washing
ton became a voter there, self-government could be
provided for the District at once.
The political question is, however, but a side issue
at present. The main point on which Washington in
sists is that Congress should continue to pay half the
expense of her government, and inasmuch as the na
tion owns and exempts from taxation about half of all
I the property in the city it would appear the claim is a
just one.
Effusions of some of the English correspondents
give evidence that the silly season is still on in Lon
don. One of them cables from London that "Presi
dent Kruger's rumored refusal of the latest franchise
demands has lost him many friends in London." Kru
ger probably had it all figured out that he could not
depend upon any of these so-called friends to shoulder
any guns in his behalf.
Germans in this country cannot fail to be pleased
at the latest utterance of Emperor William. He says
they sing better than the Germans at home. The same
old story of the songster that has liberty and the one
that has not.
Transvaal delegates to the Agricultural Union
which has just concluded its sitting at Cape Town,
were greatly impressed when Cecil Rhodes presented
them with a lion. They are lucky it was not a white
elephant.
Sir Thomas Lipton seems never to have heard
about "carrying coals to Newcastle." The other day,
at any rate, he sailed with his salts to New Rochelle.

THE VICTORY AT COLMA
A WEEK IN THE MINING FIELD.
"The Quartz-crowned Empress of the
Sierra" is going to do the right thing by
the members of the American Institute
of Mining Engineers when they call on
that distinguished member of the Amer
ican Order of Gold Mining Districts.
That, of course, is Grass Valley, where
California quartz mining began, where
phenomenal veins lure men downward.
and to which Nevada County largely owes
yet Its primacy among the gold pro
ducing counties of the State. Leading
citizens met in the City Hall the other
evening to consider the entertainment of
the institute on its visit there next week
after the annual meeting beginning in
San Francisco next Monday, and the
Daily Morning Union of Grass Valley
says: "The American Institute of Min
ing Engineers, when it visits Grass Val
ley the latter part of the month, will re
ceive such a whole-souled welcome that
the members will vote it one of the
pleasantest features of their lives." !Mter
speeches and resolutions and provision
lor various committees, a resolution of
lorrnai invitation was adopted. Suc
ceeding the preamble, the resolution was:
"Resolved, By the citizens of Grass
valley, assembled in mass-meeting this
Juth day of September, that we extend
greeting to the Institute of Mining En
gineers and invite them to visit our city
and pledge them a cordial reception by
the Quartz-crowned Empress of the
bferra and a true miner's welcome and
entertainment."
These proceedings are given here main
ly to illustrate the spirit and method of
the preparations lor the occasion
throughout the State. Of course many
other communities are making similar
preparations in a similar spirit, as is
Grass Valley's neighbor, Nevada City.
Many organized parties have come to
California before and have been enter*
tamed and shown California resources by
local communities during junketing trips
aboul the State, but in the past these
visits have always been to the prune and
orange orchards', the big trees, the fine
valleys, the flower gardens, etc. Now,
for the first time, comes an association
of people who, though they like nice Cal
ifornia prunes as well as anybody, are
interested in what is under the ground
and in the raising of or.'S rattier than
oranges, The bill tribes now, for once,
have a chance to show off the moun
tains of California and their riches, and
the Grass Valieyans are only prominent
among them.
A suit of exceptional interest to mmmg 1
men and involving a novel issue was de
cided by Judge Bennett in the Superior
Court of El Dorado County last week. In
Northern Xl norado County is a series of
peculiar formations, usually of hornblend
slate, much decomposed near the sur
face, composing bolts, in places several
hundred feet wide and being traversed in
ail directions and at all angles by many
veins, or starns, which are of varying
width and which carry gold and frequent
ly develop pockets. They are called
'â¢seam belts." These deposits have been
worked since early days, and most ex
tensively north of Georgetown, near the
Georgia Slide, which is generally taken
as the northern terminus of the mother
lode.
They have been worked a good deal by
reducing everything in stamp mills and as
pocket mines by tunneling along the
seams in the usual way, but mainly by
the hydraulic process, which gave rise to
the issue. The slates are soft and de
composed, and with a shattering of the
formation it has been piped away through
sluices like a gravel deposit. In the
Cranes Gulch mine, on the Georgetown
st am belt, this plan was adopted In early
days, and when operations were suspend
â¢ '1, in 189 L there was a pit 360 feet long,
t wide am! 160 feet deep. This was
in the Cranes Gulch mine, which was pat
ented ::s a placer mine in 1x72. The patent
was supposed, "I' course, t>> convey linal
title. Under tne law the patent to the
','placer claim" conveyed also all lodes of
mineral deposits in place thereafter dis
covered, but excepted valuable lodes then
known to exist.
A year or more ago Joseph Scherrer ana
others located some of the exposed veins
in the patented property as lode claims,
on the theory that they were valuable
lodes, known to the patentee to be such
when patent was applied for. The Crane s
Gulch Mining Company brought suit in
ejectment. The question before the court
was, of course. Were, these veins, or
"seams," or the formation carrying them,
"lodes"? Was this a placer or a lode
min<? The formation had been worked
in both ways in that region. The lawyers
brought out a lot of geology but no deci
sions. Plaintiff argued the formation to
â  â '.logically "joint seams" and "stock
work." There was no reasonable contin
uity of ore or accompanying mineral mat
ter'occupying a well-defined main channel
of mineralization. The defendants argued
that the gold came from veins of quartz
"in place"; that it was not diffused
through the mass; that the law did not
designate the length of a lode or vein,
and that these veins were lodes within
the meaning of the statute.
The court took the plaintiff's view that
this was a placer mine and bore no lodes,
and gave judgment against the defend
ants, with costs. The case will be ap
pealed.
Many old-tlxners will romPitilifr Bpn?on
vllle. In early days a busy mining village
a half mile below what is now Columbia,
Tuolumne County. It disappeared, like
many other little mining towns have done,
burned, torn down and blown awayâdis
appeared, all but one old cabin. There
Matthew Burns, one of the pioneer gold
diggers, lived alone for forty years, mak
ing enough from year to year by washing
old gravel and creviclng around to pro
vide beans and- bacon for all that was
left of lionsonville. He and his cabin
were familiar features of the highway
crossing there. Not long ago the fiat was
bought, with the idea of reworking the
ground that yielded fortunes long ago.
According to the Mother Lode Magnet,
Matthew Burns got drunk In town re
cently and died from accidental Injuries.
Then another old, wornout miner moved
into the cabin to eke out a living as
Burns had done, but the owners wanted
all the gold there was left, and so tore
down the cabin, and the last of Benson
vllle has passed into history.
Mono County chips in with Its little
mining excitement, according to the
Bridgvport Chronicle-Union, which says:
"This week has been a busy one for some
of our prospectors, and those anxious to
get rich in a hurry. The first of the week
Mr. Page, who is at the Arnot mine,
came to town with some very rich speci
mens from a new find on the extension
of the Arnot ledge on Green Creek, and
created quite an excitement, and Wednes
day a number of our citizens quietly left
town and have been locating claims on
the extension and vicinity, several hav
ing been filed with the County Clerk. We
hear this morning that a body of rich
copper has been strruck In the Copper
Mountain mine at Jordan. Mono County
will soon be In the swim again."
The Alcatrnz Asphalt Company, at Its
Sisquoc mines, has been making rather
unusual developments In the industrial
applications of electricity, says the Santa
Barbara Press. A novel use to which they
have just put electricity is in operating
a regular naval' searchlight for the illu
mination of their asphalt mine at night.
This mine, being an open cut Jn the moun
tain side, offers a very natural field for
the use of this light. Outside of the city
of Santa Barbara no place in the county
has such a complete electric plant as is
found tucked away in these mines. The
complete equipment of an electric station
has been installed. In addition to a high
speed and torpedo boat style of electric
light generator, the company has just
completed putting into operation a large
power engine and generator to supply the
electric current for use solely for power
machines, as electric pumps, shop motors
and their huge electric crane or excavator
This last machine is in itself quite an
electric novelty, being nothing less than
a large dredger, but applied to asphalt
digging. Us current is supplied by an
overhead trolley line over a hundred feet
high in the air, and is stretched from one
mountain spur to another, and directly
over the mine. The mines are now in op
eration and eating into their mountain
of asphalt, the mill being in regular run
ning order and asphalt being transmitted
through its twenty-mile pipe line to the
sea at Gaviota.
The shortage of water in the mountains
is the talk of most mining men who have
been there recently, says the Stockton In
dependent. The Tuolumne Water Com
pany is having trouble with Its dams, and
on that account many of the mines are
being worked with reduced forces or have
to shut down their mills altogpuier. Most
of the mines are running, however, and
the ore is being stored for such time as
water enough can be secured for turning
the mills and operating the stamps. Some
new mills are being put up, and many
more will be built early in the spring.
An issue concerning a quartz ledge on
a patented placer claim slightly similar
to that in which the Cranes Gulch mine
of El Dorado C<sunty is involved has just
been ruled on by the Interior Depart
ment. The decision is probably of inter
est, and if It had been given ten days
earlier it would have saved the life of
"Jake" Randall. The property over
which the issue arose was composed of
two quartz claims and one placer
claim within the townsite of Keswiek,
Shasta County. Joseph A. Kahny ap
plied for patent to the three claims, in
which quartz and placer propositions
were mixed in some way not clearly ex
plained in existing accounts. One of the
claims was Jumped, and the General
Land Commissioner sustained the jump
ers. Now the Secretary of the Interior
has reversed the decision on grounds not
made clear in the brief reports received.
Randall had located a claim overlapping
the one in dispute between Kahny ana
the claim jumpers, and was killed wnne
asserting his right to possession. A full
account of the case would probably pre
sent some interesting points In mining
law.
In several counties of the State both
talk and experiment concerning the use
of oil on highways to reduce both dust
and the impediment of sand to traction
is going on. It is possible that this use
of oil will yet add a good deal to the
home demand for crude petroleum. In
Modesto County Supervisor George W.
Abbott recently put 100 gallons of crude
oil on l?, 0 yards of sand road, under un
favorable conditions making it dustless
and the draft on horses more than one
third less. In Los Angeles oil would now
cost 5 cents a gallon in tank car lots.
Our mines are all busy getting out ore,
and the mills have to run night and nay
to keep up with the mines. The Butte
mine is running three shifts. The Ken
Dog mill, at Johannesburg, is running
full tilt, and averages from 300 to 400 tons
per month.â Randsburg Miner.
Even Placer County has a gold-areng
ing enterprise in view. R. G. Hantorrt
of San Francisco has secured 1600 acres or
land two miles from Lincoln, which will
be prospected with the view of -working
the gravel with a dredge. ,
Another electric proposition Is tnat
which has recently been floated under
the name of the Sierra Water Power
and Light Company. Its power plant is
to be located somewhere near ( a,rtfc'rs,
and its projectors propose to supply an
of the east belt nnd part of the mother
lode with light and power. The water
power is to be obtained on one or tne
forks of the Tuolumne River.â Stockton

There are thirty-seven gold-producing
counties in the 156,000 square miles or
California's area. San Francisco has
hern investing money in mines for fifty
years and Is to-day more heavily inter
ested in mines in California and else
where than ever before. In one county in
California San Francisco has put over
$5,000,000 In the last three years. There are
fewmining districts in an; part of the west
half of America in which San Francisco
capital is not invested, but ten San Fran
ciscofl could not furnish the requisite
amount of money necessary to develop
the multitude of deserving mining pro
jects daily brought to its attention. Since
the discovery of gold in California this
one State has produced gold to the value
of over $1,300,000,000. There are now over
17.000 undeveloped mines in California
awaiting capital to become profitable pro
ducers.âMining and Scientific Press.

after the keel was laid. This would be a
pretty good record for a British yard and
the tendency in all countries, even in

of building. The Garibaldi had 3000 tons
of material in her hull when launched and
she is of .6840 tons displacement, her di

chains were attached to each side of
the vessel. The strain was too great for
the hull to stand this pull and portions of
the upper part of the hull were ripped off

Good Worit of the State Fair Club.
Breeder and SDortsman.
An example has been set by the citizens
of Sacramento this year that can be emu
lated with profit by the residents of other
cities where annual fairs are held. Realiz
ing the fact that the fair was an immense
benefit to the capital city and that it de
served their hearty support, a number of
the leading business men organized
themselves into a State Fair Club and be
gan an energetic and concerted move
ment to boom the State"s exposition and
show the visitors from abroad that Sac
ramentans were alive to its value and
appreciated the benefits derived from
having- it located permanently in their
city. Knowing that the racing end of the
fair would take care of itself, the State
Fair Club centered its energies on the pa
vilion exhibit, and raised a fund which
was expended in decorating- the building,
aiding exhibitors, providing amusements
and attracting visitors. The result has
exceeded the expectations of the most
enthusiastic among them, and has not
only tilled the pavilion nightly with the
largest crowds ever seen within its walls,
but has attracted the attention of the
State to the fair, and brought to Sacra
mento people from all parts of the Pa
cific Coast.
What has been done by the State Fair
Club of Sacramento can be accomplished
by similar organizations in the towns
w"here district fairs are held. It only
needs concerted action on the part of
the citizens of each district to make the
California circuit of fairs a great fea
ture of the State's summer season, and
attract not only the attendance of thou
sands of visitors, but result in an actual
financial benefit to the towns where the
fairs are held. Nothing that the citizens
of any California community can do will
bring their locality into notice more gen
erally than the organization of a District
Fair" Club that will have for its object
the securing of a first-class exhibit of
all products of the district at a fair to
be held next year. The State Fair Club
has furnished an object-lesson of what
organization and energy will accomplish.
It can be studied with profit by the cit
izens of every district in California-

INTO THE OCEAN
A SUCCESSION of pisantic waves
swept without warning about 10
o'clock yesterday morning over
the Olympic Bait Water Com
pany's pier near the Cliff House,
carrying an unknown boy to his death
in the ocean, knocking down and
bruising two others and thoroughly
drenching the other men and boys on
the structure.
The boy that was drowned was
not more than 14 years old. He had
gone to the end of the pier some
time before the first wave struck with
1 >tto Barth, aged IT. residing at 210
Fourteenth street, and G. F. Beards
ley, aged 10, of 546 Fourth street.
They walked to the extreme end,
when tiny threw in their lines and
began to tish. They were unacquaint
ed with one another. They had fished
in silence for about fifteen minutes
and the unknown was In the act of

ed up by a wave and thrown a little
distance, though not into the water.
When the warning- was given the
unknown boy did not seem to realize
the danger which was close at hand.
He stood transfixed, and made no ef
fort whatever to secure him self .When
the wave struck him he waA lifted
on its bosom and carried into Hie b< a.
For a while he swam heroically, and
had almost reached a pile when a
second wave dashed up and took him
beyond the reach of help. There was
a crowd on the pier a short distance
off, ami nearly everybody who com
: more or less of a
drenching. It did not take thr m<n
long, however, to recovei thema

tli<? wharf cose to me, .t>3 i pur my
left hand through it and clasped ,n*
wrist with the other hand. When
the wave struck me it seemed to come
as fast as a train of cars, and it
caught me with force enough to
break my hold and toss me quite a
distance up the pier, where I landed
flat on my face. I managed to grab
the plank walk that runs to the end
of the wharf and held on until the
second wave passed over me. I then
ran for the shore, but had to stop
.md hold on to the rail, as there were
other big waves following meâ some
six or seven in all. There was a crowd
of people near the shore end of the
wharf, and from there they watched
the poor boy drown.
"I ran to the life-saving station and
notified them of the accident, and
they put out a boat at once, but
could not find the boy. They succeeded
only in rinding two hats. " Mine was
lost.
"When I yelled for the others to
look out for the big wave, the boy
who was drowned had Just landed a
fish and was baiting his hook, and
when he saw the wave coming he
seemed to be paralyzed with fear, as
he made no effort to save himself,
but stood there as if transfixed.
"When I saw him after the first wave
had washed him overboard he was
only a few feet from the wharf and
seemed to be swimming easily, and I
thought that, with another stroke or
two, he would have reached the
wharf. Just then the second wave
struck him and when I saw him again
he was at least twenty yards away.
It was while I was running to the
station that I last saw him. He had
".hen quit swimming and was making
his last struggle."
The fate of the unknown lad is
similar to that of more than a dozen
others on the same pier. The com
pany has posted a notice forbidding
persons from walking out on the
bridge, but nevertheless thousands
of people climb upon the structure
every Sunday. The drowned boy
wore a checkered suit of clothes,
knee pants, and had a soft gray hat
on. He is said to have been about 14
years of age. It was reported that
he resided on the 400 block on
Xatoma street, but inquiry in that
neighborhood failed to discover his
identity.

SKILLED LABOR
NOW IN DEMAND
ON TRANSPORTS
Workmen Control the
Situation.
TROUBLE ON OVERTIME PAY
GENERAL STRIKE MAY COME
AT ANY TIME NOW.
Uncle Sam Has Seventeen Troopships
That He Wants to Get Away by-
First Week in October
If Possible.
Skilled labor is in demand on the water |
I front. The fleet of transports now in port
; has created an immense amount of work, i
and in consequence machinists, boiler
makers, carpenters and painters are
' working night and day, Sundays and holi
days. This state of affairs has raised
some very fine points in the various
I unions.
Directly a steamer has the red, white
I and blue stripes painted on her funnel, j
i the men look upon her as a Government j
I transport, and in consequence claim eight
I hours as a day's work. This state of af-
I fairs has given rise to a number of con
-1 ferences between masters and men, and
the latter have invariably shown a de
sire to be reasonable.
Tilings have now come to a stage, how
i ever, that will result in some material
changes this week, or else there will be !
a general strike. The bollermakers have j
I hitherto been working nine hours on ship j
; work and getting paid for ten hours. Now j
they demand an eight-hour day with ten
hours' pay. Under the old rules, for
eleven hours' night work they got twenty-
I two hours' pay, but now they insist upon
I twenty-six hours' pay for .oe same
amount of work. As an example of the
manner in which the new schedule will
work, one of the boilennakers received for
' his last week's work sixteen and a half
. aays' pay at $3 50 a day.
The machinists are asking for an eight
< hour day and double time tor night work
I and Sunday and holiday work.
The painters have organized a union and
will ask that no man be employed on a
Government transport who does not know |
how to mix paint. An eight-hour day will |
also be insisted upon, and the pay is to
i be raised to $3 a day. The carpenters will
I be satisfied with an eight-hour day and
i double pay for overtime.
Such was the condition of affairs yes
i terday on the Government vessels. On
I the bhe*idan the boilermakers will not
; go to work to-day unless their demands
. are complied with. The Fulton Iron
Works, which has the job, shows no signs
,of yielding. On the Grant and Sherman
! the boilennakers are nearly through with
the job. The demands of the machinists
working on them have been granted. On
i the Centennial the men are getting what
they asked.
On the Tacoma there is considerable
â  work to be done to-day, and unless the
men's demands are granted there will be
a strike on her as well as on the Sheri
; dan. The Glenogle is to be fitted out, the
: Valencia. Zealandia, Olympia, Lennox and
Victoria are all expected here within a
week and will have to be overhauled,
: while the City of Peking is to be taken
for a transport as soon as she arrives
from China, and will require considerable
work done on her. Skilled labor will there
fore be kept going night and day right
along, and as the supply is limited it
looks as though the men will get what
they ask for. Uncle Sam has said that
! eight hours shall constitute a day's work,
â¢ and the men think it only fair that he
I should practice what he preaches.
In the case of the painters there is like
ly to be some friction. The Government
â¢ officials may look with favor on an eight
i hour day, but they will not pay any $3 for
it. "There will be no advance in wages,"
' said a member of the quartermaster's de
partment yesterday. "Any old sailor can
paint a ship, and if it comes to a show
down we will make a requisition for a
regiment of men from the Presidio and
will set them to work painting the ships.
Half a dozen men can mix enough paint
i to keep a regiment going, and we'll see
that they do it."
Everything was quiet on the transport
j wharf yesterday, but it remains to be
I seen what the next twenty-four hours will
i bring forth. â¢ Â :.r

AERONAUT FALLS
FROM PARACHUTE
ROBERT EARI-STON, an aeronaut,
fell yesterday afternoon from a
parachute that he had cut loose
from a balloon at Glen Park, and
went down like a rocket, a distance of
thirty feet, striking upon his head on a
pile of loose dirt and rocks. A thousand
spectators witnessed the thrilling sight.
Earlston went up a distance of 1000 feet
with the balloon. When he left the
ground he had hold with his teeth of a
rope attached to the bar of the para
chute. He at once set to work to give
an exhibition of his skill and performed
a number of tricks in midair. At thtÂ»
height of about 1000 feet he cut loose.
The parachute opened promptly and he
began to journey downward, holding
on to the parachute bar. As he came
down, not any faster than usual, the bar
of the parachute struck against one of
the new Mission street road's trolley
wires. That threw the aeronaut.
Down went Earlston, striking on his
head. A crowd of people ran to him.
He had good nerve and managed to get
upon his feet and walked a step or two.
Then he was carried to the theater.
After a while he was put on a car and
went to the City and County Hospital by
himself. It was found he had a slight

CARRERA IN TROUBLE.
Cashier of the Union Pacific Salt Com-
pany Short in His Accounts.
When Edward G. Carrera, cashier of the
Union Pacific Salt Company, closed his
handsome residence at 3363 Washington
street and departed on what was supposed
to be his summer vacation about two
weeks ago, his friends were unaware that
he was under a cloud, and they did not
know that Mrs. Carrera, Instead of leav
fracture of the skull and was also cut
about the head. Earlston insisted on
walking from the hospital to a street
car and went home to his lodging seem
ingly not seriously the worse for his
fall."
Earlston is well known among aero
nauts and has been touring the Pacific
Coast towns recently, giving exhibitions.
He weighs fully 170 pounds and has had
previous falls from ballons, being lame
as the result of a previous accident.
ing the city with her husband, went to
the home of her father, Hugo Herzer,
where she now is. Neither did they know
that before taking his departure from the
city, Carrera deeded his fine residence to
the First National Bank, to protect that
institution from possible loss through his
peculiar financial operations.
It appears that Carrera, in addition to
being the cashier of the salt company,
also acted as the confidential clerk of the
president of the corporation, John Barton.
Mr. Barton trusted Carrera implicitly
and when he expected to be absent from
his place of business for a day was in
the habit of signing a number of blank
checks and leaving them with his clerk
to fill out and use in the payment of bills.
. Carrera filled out these checks so indus
triously that President Barton's balance
in the First National Bank was quickly
exhausted. It was not until aggregating
overdrafts a goodly sum had accumulated,
however, that one of the notices sent out
by the bank officials informing him of the
conditions of his account, escaped tne
vigilance of Carrera and caught Barton's
eye. Upon receiving this notice Barton
called on President Wilson of the bank
and at the latter's suggestion sent for
Carrera and demanded an explanation.
The result was the deeding by Carrera of
his property to the bank and his sudden
departure for parts unknown. Carrera's
alleged peculations are said to amount to
at least $5000 and may reach double that
amount. His residence is valued at $17,000
and is mortgaged for $6,500.
Mr. Barton has placed the entire matter
in the hands of the bank officials and de
clines to be interviewed on the subject.
Mr. Herzer and Mrs. Carrera say they do
not know where Carrera is, nor why he
went away.

[LETTER -TO MRS. PINXRAM WO. 92,649!
M I feel it my duty to write and thank
you for what your Vegetable Com-
pound has done for me. It is the only
medicine I have found that has done
me any good. Before taking your medi-
cine, I was all run down, tired all the
time, no appetite, pains in my back and
bearing down pains and a great suf-
ferer during- menstruation. After tak-
ing two bottles of Lydia E. Pinkham's
Vegetable Compound I felt like a new
woman. lam now on my fourth bottle
and all my pains have left me. I feel
belter than 1 have felt for three years
and would recommend your Compound
to every suffering woman. I hope this
letter will help others m find a cure
for their troubles." â Mrs. Uella
Remicker, Eensselaeb, Lnd.

pain and ache has a cause, and the
warning they give should not be disre-
garded.
Mrs. Pinkham understands these
troubles better than any local phy-
sician and will give every woman free
advico who is puzzled about her
health. Mrs. Pinkham's address is
Lynn, Mass. Pon't put off writing until

IS CAPTURED
BY METALLIC
Pasha Kennels' Greyhound
Shows High-Class Form
at Union Park,
Pasha Kennels' imported greyhound
Metallic showed yesterday that she was
rapidly rouhdlng into her true form by
defeating a strong Held of dogs at Union
Coursing' Park. Her early trials were not
of the best but ns she worked her way I
down toward the final she showed im- ;
proved form. In the final, where she met
K. E. de B. Lopez' Mineola, she led by
four lengths, having unlimited speed, and
bhut out her opponent pointless.
The most interesting: course of the day
was between Connemara and Firm
Friend. The latter, as true, and as game
a greyhound as ever went to slips, was
running In grand form all day. The first
trial was an "undecided," each scoring
two points. The next time out Firm
Friend led from slips and, after a long |
course, won by a score of sixteen to ,
eleven points. " "Con" had possession of
tho hare for a time and worked it well, I
but Firm Friend proved' too much for .
him. The long course told on Firm !
Friend, for, when he met Minneola In the
succeeding round, he retired from the i
stake.
Young America was defeated by Isora â¢
after an "undecided" In which each
scored two points. .Nora then won de
cisively, scoring live points to one. In
the opening round when Swedish met j
Crawford .Braes, the latter was favorite
In the betting at ten to one. To the sur
prise of the bettors, Swedish won by a
score of Fix to four. Johnny R put Lord
Byron out, the score being nine to seven.
Minneola and Wait A Little ran a "no
go," each scoring three points. In the
run off, Minneola won, seven to five. Me
tallic defeated Mora In the third round,
scoring seven to nothing for the black
greyhound.
The consolation of the California Pro
duce stake was won by J. H. Perigo's
Lady Davenport. The same owner's Bohe
was* favorite for the stake, but was re-,
tired by "Warrior, who was one to ten I
in the betting. The score was eight to six. j
In the morning isarcissus defeated Aga
memnon, scoring llfty-four to nothing. ]
In the final Sweet Emma was a pro
nounced favorite, the prevailing odds
being seven to one. She led up and se- ]
cured one turn and then ceased trying.
Lady Davenport then took three turns !
and killed, winning the stake.
The attendance was large and the cours- \
ing of high class tnrouehout the day. The j
fortunes of the draw brought the best!
dogs together, rnus leaving a wide range j
of speculation as to the ultimate winner.

McLAUGHLIN
THREE TIMES
RIFLE "KING"
Scores Made on the First Day
of the California Schuetzen
Club's Annual Shoot.
D. W. MeLaughlin is a thrice crowned
"king." By the Blender margin of ono
point gained in 200 shots, the veteran
marksman proved his superiority over all
| opponents at Schuetzen Park yesterday,
! and for another year will be looked upon
j as the "biggest gun" of them all.
I So closely was Mclaughlin crowded for
the honors of "kingship" by A. Strecker
that it took the official count to determine
I who was entitled to the position, while
! F. E. Mason was only two points In the
rear of Strecker. Friends of the latter
declare that "if visions of sausage and
sauerkraut had not disturbed the
serenity of his mind" there would to-day
be a new king in rifle land, while the
partisans of John Utschlg, whoso rifle
harked to the tune of fourth, was handi
capped by the nervousness resulting from
controlling a desire to slaughter a car
toonist.
Although the first day of thr fall prize
shooting of the California Schuetzen CUib
is past, the prizes for the members' coji-
tost, the prize judge contest and the preps
Bhoot will not occur until to-day. The
bullseye shooting was finished and a com
plete list of scores made out.
Twenty-five cash prizes will l>e awarded
for th>' most points and twenty-five for
the best centers. Jn premium.-' for fla^s
$500 is to he awarded, while Jewelry, bH
verware and a number of other articles
aggregating (1000 in value will he district
uted to winners on the honorary targets.
On the point targets the twelve-inch black
lias been divided into three points, the
markers showing a white flag for one
point, a blue for two and a red for three.
Prizes on the honorary target were won
. yesterday by the following: John Meyer,
72: Chris Meyer, 70; C. J. Walden, 67; ;Â«..

BOXER GEORGE GREEN
LEAVES FOR DENVER
George Greon. the clever welter-weight
boxer, left fur Denver last night to place
himself in readiness to meet the winner of
the Purtell-Goft fight, which is to be heM
the latter port of this month. Green re
ceived a personal message from "Bat"
Maaterson to start immediately for the
battleground, nrs he desired him to referee
a number of bouts to be held during the
boxing carnival and also prepare himself
for a contest.
Since his defeat at the hands of the
Californlan, Ooff has been more thnn
anxious for a return match in the hope
of retrieving his lost laurels. Green has
always been willing to accommodate the
lanky protege of Billy Madden and if
<i"ff is Bilccessful in his light with Pur
tell a match will be made immediately and
be held before Masterson's Club. Green
said yesterday that he was confident of
"doing the trick" in less time than he
took nt. Woodward's Pavilion.

DUDES TAKE
TWO GAMES
FROM LOCALS
A Fistic Aftermath Resulted
From the Morning;
Game.
Onkland 3, San Francisco O.
Wlth thrir consciences all twisted for
having given their I'ncle so much heart
pain, the locals went to their own funeral
yesterday afternoon and Hank Harris
walked slowly behind. It was a mighty
crowd that saw the tail-enders rub
prickly defeat into the skins of San Fran
cisco's diamond artistsâ next to the larg
est Of the season md that is what made
the medicine more bitter.
Sau Francisco went the full nine in
nings without worrying the boy on the |
score-board. The Dudes were not
so kind, however. They opened his
eyes at the end of the fifth, when two
clangs caused wild excitement in the
Oakland bleachers and in the bar b*>low. |
Oakland had cracked the ice. unraveled |
some of the knots of Fireman Fitz's de
livery and sot the anxious crowd into a j
flutter of emotion. The fifth inning, at
least Oakland's part of it, wan just the j
kind of ball the Sunday enthusiasts crave.
From the first to the fifth the game
belonged to the pitchers, Fltzpatrlck and
Michael Angelo Steffani. There was an
occasional hit and some pretty fielding,
bu( none of the Interest which comes
from filled bases and long drives at ex- !
pectant moments.
Lange started the fun in the fifth With
a hit to left. Sthmeer took up the stick
after him and tipped the ball along the
line from third to home. Swindells,
Riley and Fltzpatrlck were after it, but ,
they waited for the ball to roll foul which '
it did hot and Bchmeer was safe, while
Lange went to Becond. Moskiman jogged
to first on four bad ones, all bags being
then mounted. Michael Augelo Steffani
was then called into action and he i
whispered to the ball in Greek. This had
the effect of placing a hot grounder in
Riley's hands and Lange was frozen out
of the game. Hutchlnson with an evil â 
eye smote the spheroid to Sullivan, who
Juggled, allowing Schmeer to score, Hutch i
taking first in safety. Hammond wanted
to make himself famous by knocking out ;
a homer, but he went out on a foul to |
Sullivan far over by the fence. "Flash- i
light" Hardie received four balls and this
forced Moskiman over the plate. The
agony was ended when Franks hit to
Kiley, who threw him out at first.
In the sixth Lange scored on a hit to |
center which gave him first base, a steal
placed him at the middle station, a sacri
fice of Schmeer's advanced him to the
third bag and a hit by Moskiman sent
him over the rubber. This made the third j
run for the Dudes and there they stopped.
Several times during the game the locals
acted as if they were about to score, but
that was th. net result of their labors.
Hits were few and scattered; errors for
the Dudes there were none, but a quar
tet blackens the last column of the
Wasps' score. In the fifth inning a man
by the name of I. Hockey sitting in a
box was caught between the eyes by a
foul and his face is now in mourning.

MORNING GAME.
Oakland 6, San Francisco 2.
There is no love in the heart of the Dude
for the wearers of the yellow and black
uniforms. Uncle Harris knows this too
well, and the very next time he sends his
men into the cyclonic rush of an Oakland
crowd he will arm them with several
kinds of steel plating. All this is due to
the aftermath of the morning game, in
which the Brummols made the best of the
eighth inning and piled up a heap of foui
runs when two men had been presented
with tombstones. That Is why there is
no joy on Stockton street.
The game promised to be a duplicate of
the Saturday afternoon contest until the
eventful eighth, when Iberg's undiscover-
I ables were found by a section of Dudes,
and then fireworks that rivaled the Bel
redere night in Venice, were shot all over
the urban ball tossers. San Francisco had
.scored two runs in the sixth. Oakland one
in the same inning and another in the fol
lowing, tying the score in a manner that
persuaded Cal Ewlng that he was still
alive. The Wasps came to the hat in the
eighth with a goodly array of stick talent,
but three outs without a run and only a
single hit was all they got. Then it was
the time fur Oakland to throw the calcium
upon itself and it was most successful.
Five hits and four runs was their portion.
A hit by Hammond that wont through
Ih^rg's hands gave Mr. Borchers, the
model, the opportunity to score and he
started the game of runs. Altogether,
fourteen hits came from Iberg's delivery.
The fun did not stop with the game.

his fist shot out.

UNION SERVICES OF
BAPTIST CHURCHES
The second day J s celebration of the fif
tieth anniversary of the First Baptist
Church drew yesterday large audiences,
both in the morning and afternoon. It
la the first time in many years that th<s
various Baptist churches have joined . â -
gether In one edince and last evening the
services were of a highly interesting
character on that account.
In the Eonurg the exercises consisted
of an>4>rgaÃ prelude by Organist H. K.
Mitchell; prayer and response by the
quartet. Messrs. TVilliarns. Marcuda.
Crane and McCorrle; soprano solo by ili^s
Fanny L. Deimy. The anniversary sÂ«r
nos was delivered by Pastor E. A. Wood?.
In the evening the union services of the
Baptist churches attracttfd the larsest
congregation of the celebration. Ad
dresses were delivered bygvartous clergy
men on the progress of th<Hr work in their
respective pastorates and a musieai pro
gramme had been specially prepared for
the occasion: M!ss Nellie Shipley played a
cornet Â«oio at the offertory; 11. Williams
sang the hymn. "Ninety and Nine," ani
Mrs. Gallahorn *ang a solo.
The first address or the evening was de
livered by Rev. Robert WbtttaJcer. who
spoke for Brother Duncan, a colored Bap
tist! who organized a church in this city
In 1552. He was followed by R^v. Charles
Paina of the Swedish Baptist church, who
has labored zealously among the foreign
population. Rev. Henry A. Fisk spoke of
the Institutional Church on Hyde street
which he has organized.
Rev. W. C. Jenkins told of the splendid
results obtained by the individual
churches nnd was followed by Lee To. in
charse of the Chinese Baptist church. He
told of the establishment of the church
among his people in this city thirty years
ago. whereby thousands of his country
men had been brought into the faith.
â  I hope the time is not far distant,"'
saii he. "when China will be called a
Christian land and God will surely reward
you for your good work in our behalf."
PONTIUS PILATE AND
THE COURT AT RENNES
Rev. Wiliam Rader of the Third Conge
ra'ional Church delivered a sermon last
nizht on "Pontius Pilate in France." The
Â«"Â«?aker took Munkacsy's famous paint
ing of "Christ Before Pilate" and pointed
out the difference in character between
the Savior and the Roman ruler. 1- part
te said:
Pilate was unstable, vacillating and
untrue. He is rememberd in history
as on- 1 of the world's worst coco. KÂ»
waÂ« also false to his convictions.
Portius Pi:ate has been in Rome, In
Paris Toulon and San Francisco. H*
is the dangero-us man of the world.
His spirit sat in judgment upon
Dreyfus. the Jew. at K-ennea. It waa
Pilate who broke his sword. It was
Piuite who disgraced him before the
world. But several things he did not
acÂ« among them the expres3:o-n of in
ternational sympathy which btad3 the
nations witS something more tangiole
than a steel 1 cable under the seaa.
That the world's *ense of justice
should be recovered in one moment
demonstrates the hold that righteous
ness has upon the human heart, it
would ixs a foolhardy move for any
country to boycott the Parts Exposi
tion or for President McKinley to take
official action In this matter. It is
sufficient that the waves of the
world* indignation break over the
armyiof France and the court at
Rennes. It must be remembered,
too that the nations stand by the Jew
not' because the man is a Jew. but be
<"iuÂ«e the Jew fa a man. This outourst
of patriotic brotherho.M is an eloquent
assault upon race prejudice.

HOW HAPPINESS
CAN BE GAINED
JamÂ«Â« H. GrtfTes lectured before the
rr.'.versal Brett erhood in the Academy of
Sciences Hall last evening on "Personal
Salvation." He said tft-re wa3 no such
Ch'ng as a salvation of self apart from
the salvation of the race and that the
cry of self for a personal happiness was
the apotheosis of selfishness and largely
responsible for the defection of so many
thoughtful nÂ»n and women from the
â¢reeiis which have based their claim upon
the public to their power to bestow a
personal salvation as a thing apart from
the salvation of the race as a whole.
Continuing he said:
Happiness can only be obtained T>y
forgetting self, by losinj? self In un
â¢emsh effort for the whole. Modern
economic writers have foretold the
salvation and perpetuation of this
civilization because it possesses the
faculty of altruism, or unselfishness.
This is thÂ« purpose of the Universal
Brotherhood and Thecsophieal Society.
To spread abroad the doctrine of al
truism and give tt an Intelligent and

The Pearl of Parables
Rev. E. N'elander of the Flr3t English
Lntheran Chw delivered a sermon last
night on "ThÂ« Pearl of Parables." In
' part be said:
The story of the prodigal son con
tains a "plot" of surpassing interest. It
will never be superannuated. Inasmuch
aj it tÂ« true to every age and iikelv to

THE SAX FEA>~CISâ¬O CALL, MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 18. 1899.
BERKELEY WILL
SOON POSSESS A
NEW TOWN HALL
D. J. Tobin Seils a
Site to the City.
BERKELEY. Sept. 17.â much
vexed mutation of a new town ha . for
this city ia at last settled. The old
structure standing midway between East
and West Berkeley will soon be a thing of
the past. It ia far enough away from the
eastern and western portion of the town
to be not readily -accessible to either. The
new situation has at ieast the merits of a
good central location, and will stand not
far from the center of the business por
tion of the city.
The Board cf Trustees have been con
sidering the proposition for some time
past, but the worst ha 3 been carried on
by a committee and was not generally
known. That the decision * haa b*en
reached so auietiy will come as a surprise
even to those who knew that the negotia
tions were going on. The board disposed
of the matter at a special meeting held
in the old town hall la-st night.
Two sites were offered. One was a por
tion of the Snattuck estate on the west
side of Shaxtuck avenue, tendered by Mrs.
F. K. Shattuck. "Ine otfler lies in the M _â -
Gee tract, also on the west side of Shat
tuck avenue, and was offered by D. J.
Tobin a.} representative of the McGee
property. The board chose the latter.
There are many advantages In the Mc-
Gee property, aside from the difference in
price, which induced the Trustees to make
the selection they did. The new piece of
land lies between Grove street. Allston
way, Mary street and Strawberry Creel
Two of the streets passing it are already
graded and 3idewalka laid. The presence
of Strawberry Creek will serve to set off
the new municipal building, by preventing
the building of other structures near it.
The consideration named in the sale i 3
S3OOO. The time in which it is to be paid
is three years.

Re\". Mr. L'lrich was assigned to the Rich

here from Kentucky, where he has been

SUNDAY AT THE PARK.
Unusually Large Crowds Enjoy an
Outing â Inn at Sutro's Baths.
Many thousands of - â  pie enjoy I an
outing at the park yesterday. Around
ibe baad stand a crowd of unusual pro
portions gathered, and there was a great
concourse at the Gartield atatue to wit
ness the memorial services. The many
resorts were crowded to the gates. No
accidents were reported. At the Chutes
fully Tf.xiO people passed the gates and re
mained throughout the day, witnessing
the anal feature, tte high-diving exhibi
tion-v//.
Sutra's Baths also entertained a large
proportion of the pleasure-seekers. The
results of .the aquatic contests follow:

The park band stopped playing for more
than an hour yesterday afternoon for no
appa/ent cause, and rumors were rife

to begin the contest then and there. It
appears, however, that the playing was

FAREWELL LETTER
OF THOMAS B. REED
To the Bepublicans of the First Maine
District He Expresses Publicly
His Thanks.
PORTLAND, Me.. Sept- 17.â The Press
will print to-morrow ..he following-:
To the i.epublicans of the First
Maine District: While I am naturally
reluctant to obtrude myself again upon
public attention, even here at home, I
am sure no one would expect me to
leave the First Maine District after
so long a service without some words
expressing to you my appreciation of
your friendship and my gratitude for
your generous treatment. Words
alone are quite inadequate ami I must
appeal to your memories. During
three and twenty year 3of political
life, not always peaceful, you have
never questioned a single public act of
mine. Other men have had to look
after their districts.' My district ha 3
looked after me. This, in tae place
where I --was born, where you know
my shortcomings as well as ] do my
self, gives me a right to be proud of
my relations with you. So honors are
ever quite" like those which come from
home. It would not be just for me
to withhold my thanks from those
Democrats who have so often given
me their votes. This friendship I can
acknowledge with all propriety even
In ,1 tetter to Republicans, for both
they and you know that I have never
trimmed a sail to catch the passing
breeze or ever flown a doubtful flag.
Office, as a ribbon to stick in your
coat, is worth nobody's consideration.
Office, as opportunity, is worth all con
sideration.
That opportunity you have given me
untramir.- in the fullest and
amplest measure and I return your
sincerest thanks: if I have deserved
any praise it belongs of right to you.
Whatever may happen. I am sure that
the First Maine District will always
be true to the principles of liberrv,
self -government and the risrtit of man.
THOMAS B. REED.

SMALLPOX REPORTED
AMONG VOLUNTEERS
A Case Developed in the Thirty-
First Regiment
Isolated at Once, With a Surgeon and Four
Men of the Hospital Corps Who Offered
Themselves for the Service.
THAT there are as brave men as have
gone to the war or are going to It,
is being proved out in the quaran
tine hospital at the Presidio. A sur
geon and four men of the Hospital
Corps have gone out on the hill with
a suspected smallpox patient, and alone
they will fight against the disease. There
will be no one allowed near them; they
will be cut off for weeks from their friends
and comrades, but they went willingly
when the call came and they hesitated no
longer than It took to say good-by.
The caso developed in the general hospi
tal, the patient being John C. White of
Company M of the Thirty-first Infantry.
Whito was sent to the hospital Saturday
evening. He showed signs of fever, but
beyond that there was nothing alarming
in hia condition until yesterday morning,
when he commenced to show symptoms of
smallpox. It is not absolutely certain that
the man has the disease, but the hospital
authorities are taking no chances, ami at
onoe White was ordered into quarantine.
He was sent out to the "quarantine" hos
pital, a small camp near the fortifications
on the hill back of the fort, and with him
went a surgeon, three men of the Hospital
< Jorpa and a cook. Everything in the
ward where White slept â bedding, cur
tains and the clothes of the patientsâ was
bundled out and taken to the formal
dehyde room, where it was given a thor

FLOODED THE
STATE WITH
BOGUS MONEY
Horton and Gray Are
Identified.
United States Marshal Shine regards
the capture of the counterfeiting outfit
â¢which waa found in the room of FrM
Gray, alias Woods, ' and George Mills,
alias Horton, as told in yesterday's Call,
as one of the moat important that has
been made for some time. The trunk,
containing the plant of the men, waa yes
terday removed to the office of the Mar
shal in the Appraisers' building.
Satisfied that he had at last run to
tnrth two of the most dangerous coun
terfeiters that ever operated in the State,
Marshal Shine lost no timti in telephon
ing to Captain Seymour, instructing him
to hold Mills and Gray. Mills Is now in
the Receiving Hospital suffering from a
gunshot wound in the foot, inflicted, by
John McCallum, a former paL
Gray was arrested at the time of the
shooting and Is being held as a witness
against McCallum. To-day formal
charges of counterfeiting and having
counterfeiter's tools in their possession
will be preferred against the men.
Mills, according to tiie police, Is one of
the worst crooks on this side of the con
tinent. His true name Is George Horton.
He is a brother of Sam Horton, a mem
ber of the reportorial staff of the Evening
Post. About five years ago Horton, alias
Mills, committed a series of burglaries in
this city, securing booty valued at over
$5000. J" it as the detectives were about
to arrefiL him he went to Alameda, whero
he was caught In the act of looting a
private residence. He was convicted
after a short trial and sent to Folson for
several years.
On his release from the penitentiary in
the latter part of August Horton went
to Sacramento, where he met Gray, who
was then engaged in flooding the northern
portion of the State with counterfeit dol
lars and half-dollars. Gray had his
"plant" with him, but acting on the ad
vice of Horton he shipped it to this city.
A day later the pair arrived here and
rented a room in a lodging-house on Grant
avenue. Suspecting that their movements
were being watched, Horton and Gray
had the counterfeiting outfit removed to
the house on Natoma street, where it was
discovered through the efforts of The
Call. They represented to tne landlady
that they were mining men from Mon-t
ough fumigation. Then every man and
woman In the hospital was ordered vac
cinated, and the order was carried out at
once upon everybody but the typhoid
fever patients. It was deemed best not
to risk complicating their cases.
Word was sent over to the camp of the
Thirty-first Regiment and steps to pre
vent possible infection were taken at once.
The tent ."White and others occupied was
j torn down and destroyed. The property
! of the sick man and of all his ten mates
was destroyed, and every one who has
been closely associated with him either in
the tent or in camp, was isolated.
The question as to wno should go out
i to the quarantine hospital with the pa
j tient was a serious one. Colonel Girard,
chief surgeon In charge of the general
hospital, did not wish to order any man
j to go out, so he called for voluntei rs.
I There was : a response at once, and he se
i looted Private Walter Doherty, nurse;
I'rivate August Zerbin, nurse; Private
Patrick Burka, orderly, and William
Banfleld, cook. Dr. John M. Wil
liams offered himself as the surgeon to
be placed in charge, but Colonel Oirani
preferred to have the matter decided by
lot. Lots were drawn among the offi
cers, and the l"t f>4l to the man who had
volunteered, Dr. Williams.
The surgeon and his four men gathered
I together what clothes they would nerd
j in their seclusion, and, making their pa
Colonel Edmund Rice, Major Ed
ward D. Anderson, Major Frank A.
Cook, Major Joseph T. Dickman,
Major Charles F. Mason, surgeon;

Captain F. A. Washburn, assistant
surgeon; First. Lieutenant R. S. Grta-
WOld, assistant surgeon; Captain
Reuben A. Whlpple. quartermaster;
First Lieutenant Frank E. Edward?;,
commissary.
The regiment has been well treated
on its way out here, and more than
one demonstration of welcome enliv
ened the journey. In Boston the men
turned out before an enthusiastic
crowd that blocked the principal
streets and the greeting the troops re
ceived was a heartfelt one, for a good
half of the regiment is made up of
men from the old Bay State.
When they reached here yesterday
tana, but intended to make this city their
home. Afu-r Inspecting: several rooms In
the house the counterfeiters finally Belect
ed the most commodious one, and' at once
proceeded to turn out bogus money.
It happened that Mrs. McCallum, the
wife of the man who shot Horton, learned
where the latter was stopping 1 , and she
concluded to pay him a visit, "just to
make her husband .iealous." as she ox
pressed It. She remainf-d only a short
time, and as she was leaving she was met
by McÂ«'.'illum. who demanded an explana
tion. The woman rather proudly boasted
that she had visited Horton and defied .
her husband to prevent her from visiting |
him whenever she saw fit. McCallum I
swore to be avenged, and aftnr lying in
wait for Horton shot him twice as he was j
walking along Sixth street.
The landlady of the bouse where the
counterfeiters lived is greatly pleased
over their arrest.
"At first I thought they were respect
able men." she remarked last night, "and
did not hesitate to rive them a room.
The following day I Became suspicious of
their actions, but did not think they were
engaged in the business of counterfeiting. â 
The woman, who is mown as Mis. Mc-
Callum, called on them several times, but
as Cray told me that she was a relative.
of Horton I paiv. no attention to hei !
visits.
"The night before the shooting T was
disturbed by a row in the room occupied
by the men, and saw the woman being
thrown into the street. I then told them
that they would have to leave my house '
and they promised to do so the next day. !
Suspecting that they were opium fiends
I secretly entered their room and found :
TRIO OF CROOKS WHO ARE ACCUSED OF VARIOUS CRIMES.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 18, 1899.
tient ready for the trip over the hills,
they left the general hospital with him.
There was no band playing as they left;
there were no cheering crowds; there
was none of the pomp and excitement of
parade. They went quietly away, like
men who know their duty and are fear
less in the face of it. In all the volun
teers there are none braver than these
men, lighting alone for the life of a
stranger comrade, and willing, for duty's
sake, to risk their lives beside him.
The going away of the Thirty-first Reg
iment may be delayed by the presence
of disease among its people so near
to the time sot for its departure. The
regiment was to have sailed on the Grant
to-day, but now she will remain here un
til the medical officers are satisfied that
the health of the regiment is perfect and
the commanding officer is willing to risk
a trip across the ocean.
The sailing of the Grant would have
been delayed over her scheduled time
anyway, as her refrigerators are not yet
ready, nor will they be ready until late
this evening or to-morrow. By that
time General Shatter will have decided
whether or not the regiment may go.
Every precaution for the safety of the
men has been taken; vaccination has been
made compulsory and every one exposed
to infection even in the slightest degree,
and the surgeon and his virus quill are
all powerful. But it may not be deemed
advisable to let the regiment start upon
a journey of such a distance until there
is no posible chance of harm to the men,
and so the Thirty-first Regiment may
have to give place to some other. It
will be hard on the men, for they were
the first here and they are more than
eager to be away, but the department is
taking no risks.
The Thirty-first came here at the end
of August from Fort Thomas, Kentucky.
ft was recruited in the Middle States and
rendezvoused at the Kentucky post, where
it remained some days before starting
westward. There was some talk of dis
ease at Fort Thomas before the regiment
gathered there, but no trace of it ever
bho wed itself among the men. Where
White caught the infection is not known,
but it is certain it was not at the Presidio
camps. He was absent without leave
for several days, and the theory of the
regimental officers is that he exposed
himself to infection somewhere in the
city. There are no ca.Â«es in the city un
known to the health authorities and not
isolated, so It is hard to see how the
infection could have taken place here.
The general opinion is that the disease
was contracted on the cars on the way to
this coast, if not at Fort Thomas itself.
Soldier Seized With Syncope.
George Morgan of Battery A, Third Ar
tillery, visited Fort Point yesterday
morning â with two friends. On their way
back to the city Morgan complained of
feeling sick. A passenger on the car of
fered him a powder to relieve his head
ache ami he swallowed it. When they
reached O'FarrelJ street and Grant ave
n'ut Morgan suddenly fell to the ground in
an unconscious condition. He was taken
m the Receiving Hospital in the patrol
wagon and after two or throe hours re
covered. Pr. Hopper's diagnosis of the
case w;is that the powder had acted upun
a weak heart and caused syncope.
morning they were dressed for the %
tropics, and their uniform included a -â¦
novelty for the troops hereâa brown '
pith helmet. Every man in the regi-

The police do not believe that jealousy

SUPERVISORS WILL
NOT BREAK PLEDGES
Tax Levy Will Be Kept Within
the Dollar Limit
Board Must Fix the Rate and Apportion
the Funds To-Dayâ Finance Commit
tee's Figures Will Be Accepted
Without Material Change,
THE Board of Supervisors will
meet to-day and adopt a tax levy
for the ensuing fiscal year. It will
be strictly within the dollar lim
it. The Supervisors freely admit
that they have their doubts of the prac
ticability of attempting to operate the
municipality on a dollar basis, but
since the people exacted pledges from
them not to exceed that amount they
do not propose to stultify themselves,
but will do as they agreed. The ap
portionment made by the Finance Com
mittee in its report submitted to the
board on August 7 has proved very
unsatisfactory, and has been subject
ed to a vast amount of criticism, but
all attempts to eliminate its objection
able features and at the same time keep
within the dollar limit have thus far
been futile. Every arrangement that
has been suggested has had the fault
of robbing one fund to satisfy the de
mands of another and the only result
apparently has been to prove that the
city cannot be run on the dollar limit
of taxation.
The figures submitted by the Finance
Committee on August 7 will be those
adopted by the board to-day, with pos
sibly a few minor changes. That they
will not be adapted without consider
able wrangling is certain, but the
amendments that will be submitted
will all contain the fatal defect of ex
ceeding the limit fixed by the people.
One such amendment will be proposed
by Supervisor Holland, but it has ab
solutely no chance of being adopted,
because it provides a tax rate of $1 10
or more. It is characterized by the fol
lowing increasej over the Finance Com
mittee's figures:
Repaying accepted streets, $105,000;
Golden Gate Park, $70,000; public
schools, $70,000; Board of Health,
$70,00.0; City and County Hospital
(ne^l $50,000; improving old hospital,
$11X000; smallpox hospital, $5000; Fire
Department, $50,000; election expenses,
$30,000; park panhandle, $SO00; Board
of Public Works, $6iioo; bond elections.
$6000.
This amendment probably will re
ceive the votes of Holland, Aigeltlnger,
Black and Phelps, but they know it
will be defeated and their only object
in voting for it will be to emphasize
their belief in the impossibility of
carrying on the city government on a
dollar limit. Having satisfied their
consciences by casting their votes for
this amendment, they will thereafter
insist on the limit being observed to the
letter.
Mayor Phelan, Supervisor Perrault
and Expert Williams tried to fix up a
levy yesterday, but after struggling
with figures all the afternoon they
found they had, notwithstanding" all
their pains, exceeded the limit. Here
is the result of their efforts:
PROPOSED CHANGES IN TAX LEVY OF 1599-1900
Total levy J5.169.fi7R
Receipts other than taxation 1.43R.578
$3, 731. 100
Outside the pledge deficiency.... sl27,ooo
Judgments 3.700
Election <-xpc-nses 75.000
Interest and sinking funds 25,400 $231,100
$3,,vt0,00fl
Levy J3.731.infl at 99.5 c on J375.0n0.000
Levy 3,731.100 at $1,066 on 3ri0.000.000
After studying these figures last
night. Supervisor Aigeltinger declared
they would not be acceptable to the
majority of the board.
"If we are going to exceed the dollar
limit, we might just as well make a
levy that will give us what we need,"
he said. "I will vote for the Holland
amendment because it comes nearer
my views than anything else so far
proposed, but the amendment will un
doubtedly be defeated and then we will
adopt a dollar limit levy, as proposed by
the Finance Committee. However, I
think that If, instead of voting bonds
for improvements, we fixed the rate of
taxation at $1 10 we would have money
eno-ugh to pave our streets, run the
city government and save the interest
on the bonds."
The committee on Fire Department of
the Board of Underwriters of the Pa
cific, consisting of William J. Dutton,
Charles D. Haven, Charles A. I^aton,
Rudolph Herold, Rolla V. Watt and
Isidor Gutte, has forwarded a petition
to "the Supervisors, protesting against
the proposed curtailment of the Fire
Department appropriation, and strong
ly urging that the appropriation be not
less than $600,000. The petition calls
attention to the fact that within the
past year the Fire Underwriters have
reduced rates so as to make a saving
j of several hundred thousand dollars a
year to the citizens of San Francisco,
â  in anticipation of the fully paid Fire
Department required under the new
charter, but that these reductions can
not be maintained without loss to the
underwriters unless the present equip
ment of the Fire Department is main
tained.
OFF FOR THE SOUTH.

tiamen Awaiting Instruction.

for tho south coast of California,
where she will take the three southern
divisions of the naval militia for a prac
tice cruise.

HIS DECISION CONTESTED
Jerome Bassity Referees a Black and
White Cakewalk.
A parti-colored oakewalk concluded
the first annual picnic of the "Wash
ington-square Athletic Club. It was
Jerome Bassity, the luckless announcer
of the decision of the judges in favor of
Tom Beattie and his sister Kitty, who
had spiritedly and successfully contested
tor the cake againsi Mr. Stewart and
Mary Jane Seattle, who precipitated the
trouble.
Mr. Stewart, a colored gentleman of
high social standing in Washington-
square, made considerable demur to the
derision. He thoupht that hp and his fair
partner were entitled to the cake, and
proceeded to make himself heard to that
effect. The trouble was soon settled, but
Bassity is not looking for another job of
that kind.
Crushed by a Car.
Albert Hemppl, a 12-year-old lad living
