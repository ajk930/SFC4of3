GREAT BRITAIN WILL SEND

But the Prospect of a Peaceable Settlement of the Con

Brighter.

LONDON, Sept. B.â The Anglo-
Transvaal situation wears to-day
a more peaceful aspect. The As
sociated Press account of the
decisions taken at the . Cabinet
Council Friday is confirmed from the
best sources of information. In adai
tion to the troops from India a brigade
of four battalions of infantry is under
orders to start for South Africa imme
diately, one from home and three from
Mediterranean stations. The sailing :
â¢if the Castle liner Harleeh Castle has
teen, canceled and the steamer will
probably be employed to transport Brit
ish troops.
A semi-official statement comes from
Pretoria through Cape Town to the
C'lTect that the Transvaal Government
has explained to the British diplomatic
agent. Mr. Conyngham Greene, that its
last dispatch was meant as an accept
ance of the proposed joint inquiry into
the franchise question. It appears
that the negotiations had become so in
volved that the Transvaal Government
itself had become confused or, perhaps
for its own purposes, wished to ap
pear so.
The Cape Town correspondent of the
Daily Chronicle says:
"It was the Transvaal attitude re
garding the suzerainty question that
caused the Afrikander leaders in Cape
Colony and the Orange Free State to
col off promptly. The Transvaal has
row resumed a practical tone and the
Afrikanders are exerting a supreme efÂ»
fort to expedite a settlement."
The Daily Chronicle avers that Lord
Salisbury's moderating influence was
felt throughout the council. This is ex
ceedingly probable, but in any case the
Cabinet was unanimous In favor of .Mr.
Chamberlain sending a strong dispatch
demanding a categorical answer to the
proposals Sir Alfred Mil her submitted
to the Bloemfontein conference.
The Times thinks "something more
than this might have been demanded,
but the Cabinet's decision meets with
universal approval; and pending devel
opments nothing further will be done."
PRETORIA, Sept ?,.â (Midnight)
The Government has issued a formal
announcement that its last dispatch

Joint inquiry. The mistaken interpre

ideas.

PRUDENCE URGED
BY THE VOLKSRAAD
PRETORIA, Sept. 8.- In the First
Raad this morning debate was resum-
Ed "ii the interpellation of th^ Govern
ment respecting the concentration of
British troops "n the border and the
stoppage of ammunition consigned to
' the Transvaal. The House adjourned
: shortly before noon, after adopting
unanimously the following resolution:
The Volksraa'd, having considered that
friendlj correspondence is still passing be
tween the Governments, that the concen
tration of troopa In great numbers near
the border has a detrimental and restless
eff< d on the inhabitants <>f the State and
, that the Transvaal lias lived In frlend-
I Bhip and peace with all nations and de
; sires to continue to live in such friendship
and peace, now declares its regrel at the
facl concentration and expresses the
opinion thai in the case of eventualities
which might lead to enmity or war be
tween t lit- two Governments the cause
would no! li<- with the republic. As re
gards the stoppage of ammunition at Del
agoa Bay, the volksraad trusts that the
I Government â will act according to circum
stances. Thf Raad further resolves to
drop the matter of the concentration of
troops on the border for the present until
tli-' Government shall sunnly further mi

S mation obtained is unsatisfactory. Never

IT IS NOW PREDICTED
THAT DREYFUS WILL BE CONVICTED
But the Officer Accused of
Treason Is Confident of
Being Found Innocent.
Demange Makes a Telling
Plea.
RENNES, Sept. 8. â Dreyfus and
his wife are confident that the verdict
wili be acquittal. Acquittal is to
them a matter of course. They are
already discussing plans for their de
parture. As for Mme. Dreyfus, she
came from the prison earlier than
usual this afternoon, calmly talking
to her brother-in-law Mathieu. No
traces of tears were on her face nor
emotion in her manner.
RENNES, September 8. â That
Captain Dreyfus will be con
demned is the almost universal
opinion heard in Rennes to
night. Hitherto there had al
ways been a divergence, but now both
camps, the Dreyfusards and the anti-
Dreyfusards. seem unanimous in the
conviction that the verdict will go
against him.
Upon just what this is based and the
precise reason for the conclusion are a
I mystt y, but there is no disguising the
fact that from M. Labori down to the
numerous Dreyfusards who crowd the
hotels and cafes and who last night
were still hopeful that Dreyfus would
be saved, all seem now to agree that
his last chance is gone.
The one source of hope is M. Labori
himself, who. said this evening to the
correspondent of the Associated Press:
"We fear Captain Dreyfus will be
condemend, but we do not intend to
throw up the sponge. We shall go on
fighting for him."
M. Jaures, the Socialist leader, and
other prominent Dreyfusards expressed
a similar opinion. Excitement is at a
fever heat and nothing is discussed but
the verdict of to-morrow.
The military precautions are of the
most elaborate character and no at
tempt at disorder is likely to have the
slightest success. Orders have been is
sud to repress the first symptom of
trouble with an iron hand.
A small anti-Semitic meeting was
held here this evening and the complete
calm that attended it is an indication
lof a quiet day to-morrow. A strong
force of gendarmes guarded the ap
proaches to the building where the
meeting was held and their orders were
to arrest the first man who raised a
seditious cry. Nothing, however, oc
curred. Indeed, the inhabitants of the
town seem indifferent and the neigh
borhood of the Lycee and the prison is
deserted, save for a few gendarmes.
The news of the publication of Count
yon Bulow's speech in the Reich
sanzeiger reached Hermes to-day and
is considered very important on the eve
of a verdict, which, in some quarters,
it is thought, will be regarded as a
slight by Germany if it be a condemna
tion, as being tantamount to a public
refusal to take the word of Empemr
William, as his Minister is merely his
mouthpiece.
According to the latest report, the
verdict may be delivered between 3
and 4 o'clock to-morrow afternoon, the
court adjoining after M. Demange's
speech until 3 o'clock.
There is some criticism of M. Labori's
decision noi to speak, the friends of M.
Demange thinking it his object to
escape bis share <>f the responsibility
in the event nf a verdict of condemna
tion. M. Demango. having once seen
Dreyfus conde~ined under his ad
vocacy, would naturally like M. Labori
to share the criticism this time, espe
cially as M. Labori has assumed- such
a prominent part in \h^ proceedings.
DEMANGE'S POWERFUL
PLEA FOR DREYFUS
RENNBS, Sept. B.â The hall nf the Ly
cee was crowded this morning at the
opening nf the fifth day of the fifth week
of the second trial by court-martial of
Captain Alfred Dreyfus of the artillery,
Charged with treason. Thr-re \v;:s a large
attendance (if ladies and newspaper writ
ers, who sat up all night in order to se
cure front places. At an early hour a
long line was formed of people awaiting
admission. Standing room at the hack of
the court now commands 15 and 20 francs,
and the demand is increasing as the trial
approaches its end.
Among Ihe privileged spectators to-day
was Baron Russell of Kilo ween, Lord
Chief Justice of England, who was con
ducted to a seat by General Chamoin and
M. Paleologueof the French Foreign Office.
The Lord Chief Justice was seated at the
back of the Judges' table. He came here
from Paris, where he waÂ» attending the
session of the Anglo- Venezuelan bound
ary arbitration commission, In order to
see something of the trial.
Maitre Detnange at once opened his
speech for the defense. In eloquent terms
and with Impressive delivery he. brought
out strong evidence against Esterhaxy.
During the oourse of his remarks he
cried .
"Do you think if Dreyfus and Ester
hazy had been before the court-martial of
1894 that the court would have condemned
Captain Dreyfus?"
As he asked this question counsel point
ed to the prisoner sitting by him and
added "No!"
"However .solemn the occasion may be. '
SaM Demange. "I must at the outset pro
test with all my soul against the allega
tion which one of the witnesses did not
shrink from uttering. This witness did
not hesitate to declare that whoever ad
vocated the revision of this case â that is
to say, whoever believed in the innocence
of I)rcyfus--was working against the
army and against the country. I here de

these statements were true. Let me tell
you simply this: The day on which, amid
the shock of furious political passions, I
saw let lonsi over our country this ter
n of madness, when I saw everything
had learned to revere and love since
childhood imperiled. I. a Frenchman, the
son .of a soldier, endured every torture.
When I turn my eyes toward Devils

from the bottom of my heart I believed
to be a martyr, I began to wonder if di

then I have recovered. 1 have hearkened
M. DEMANGE ADDRESSES THE COURT.
Most eloquent was the plea made by this note. 1 , champion of Dreyfus at
Rennes yesterday. M. Labori, chief counsel for the accused artillery captain,
has refused to address the court-martial.
to the voice of my conscience and pursued
an undeviating course, free from anger
and passion, not heeding hatred or preju
dice. I have done my duty. You will do
yours, which is to mete out justice.
Continuing. M. Demange said he wished
to clearly define the prisoner's position,
saying:
"When the case of the revision began
| Dreyfus was a convict and serious pre
! sumptions of his innocence- were neces- j
j sary before the case could be taken up j
!by "the Court of Ca&sation. To-day it is |
for the public prosecutor to prove his j
guilt. I>et no one hlamÂ« us. therefore. \
1 if we have not proved the innocence of
our client The task was not incumbent
upon us. It is for the Government com
missioner to show that he is guilty of
the abominahle crime imputed to him."
M. Demange then protested against the i
suggestion that It had been attempted to i
put Esterhazy on trial, explaining that I
all the defense desired was that the inno- i
cence of Dreyfus should appear, dazzling '
and complete, and that the court-martial
should proclaim it. Counsel was satis
fied that the judges of 1594 were honest,
like the present judges. But if the for
mer h,id seen Esterhazy's handwriting [
they would have pronounced a different j
verdict. M. Demange dilated upon the
prisoner's increasing protestations of in- \
nocence and his touching letters to his ;
family, exclaiming: "In them you see j
his soul, which speaks. Alone in his
tomb he communes with himself. He
cherished the hope of seeing his inno- i
cence acknowledged."
Among the letters of Dreyfus read hy i
M. Demange was nn^ in which, after
asserting his innocence and declaring be
always served the tri-color with devo
tion and honor, the prisoner complainedJ
that he was treated on Devils Island like
an ordinary convict. It concluded with !
the words "I wish to live."
"That is a soldier's soul!" exclaimed M. !
Demange, "and it is that man you call I
a traitor. It is that man who in your
presence restrained his sobs and his <
emotion. Ah. gentlemen. 1 would rather j
defend guilty men who are clever dissem
blers than an innocent man who is too
sincere."
' Other letters of the prisoner were read,
all breathing the same desire, to live to
see his honor disclosed, though the writer
was broken down in health and spirit
One letter, written in 1897, appeals to Gen
eral de Boisdeffre to lend his generous
aid in securing for the writer restoration
to the liberty of which he had been i
robbed.
Writing to his brother the prisoner said:
"While one or more scoundrels are walk

me to die. but it would be a disgra<

In this letter the writer urged his !

"Is not that the cry of an innocent

Concluding his examinations of the I

that he felt compelled to refer to tl
documents emanating from foreigners, as
General Mereier relied upon them to sup

will now take up the circumstantial evi
dence."
A brief adjournment of the court was
here announced.
Counsel was warmly applauded as he
took his seat. .: ; : â -'
On the resumption of the session M.
Demange discussed the circumstantial ev
idence adduced in 1894. He said the per
turbation of Dreyfus at the dictation
scene had nothing to do with producing
the idea of guilt in the minds of those
present. Colonel Dv Paty de Clam, M.
Cochefort and M. Gribelin were all con
vinced beforehand of his guilt, as a re
sult of his evidence, which they consid
ered unimpeachable, so much so that they
wished Dreyfus to blow out his brains,
but Dreyfus declined because he was in
nocent. -;'â¢'.
M Demange successfully showed, the
hollow ness Â«â : the stories of Mathieu Drey
fus' attempt to corrupt Colonel Sandherr,
the late Lieutenant Colonel Henry's the
atrical denunciation of Dreyfus as a
traitor at the court-martial of 1894 and the
reports of the detectives. He pointed out
how the prosecution had advanced as
proof the alleged statements of Individ
uals who were not in any War Office, but
whom they carefully abstained from pro
ducing for examination, especially in the
welling up on Henry's statement in 1894,
which has since been admitted to be false,
thai a certain War Office employe in
formed him that Dreyfus was the culprit.
M. Bemange then showed the emptiness
of the gambling and libertine charges
against the prisoner and said the simplest
act of Dreyfus was misconstrued, even his
legitimate desire to obtain knowledge be
ing Imputed as a crime. "Could a spy
have maintained the haughty demeanor
Dreyfus always wed toward his com
rades?" asked Demange.
After demonstrating the falsity of the evi
dence of M. Beaurepaire's witnesses- Muel
ler. Dubrieul. Villon and Cernuschi â counsel
said the only proof left was the bordereau.
Who could "have sent it? Who wrote it?
Complete light could only be shed on it
by the production of the notes enumerated
in the bordereau. This had been said by
General Zurlinden himself. But counsel
asked the court to remember that the ref
erence to those notes that all General de
Love could say was that it was not im
possible that Dreyfus might have pos
sessed them. This was all he could say
when it was a question of high treason.
M. Demange added: "You will not find
this phrase in the mouth of a witness en
titled to your respect, and it is on the
strength of such a statement that Dreyfus

to obtain such light on documents, but
since theories have been promulgated I
will suggest one. I will seek to show that
you must even put aside technical value

prosecution. I will seek to combat the cir

At the reouest of M. Demange the court

The announcement was made this after
noon that the verdict of the court-martial
will be rendered to-morrow. M. T.ibori
foregoes the right to speak for the defense
lest by doing so he irritate the judges and

The court therefore will deliberate on
the conclusion of M. Demange's speech
and judgment will probably be delivered

Bryan came down on tofnight's Virginia j

crrning to-day's press dispatch from Sim- â

"I have not had time to read the. dis

as I understand it the people of India ,

authenticity of the report and a copy of

"If it is true it simply goes to Illustrate

"What will be the effect of this

"It will affect the price of silver," he
replied.
"What effect will it have on the silver

"if it has any effect it ought to be to

When asked If it would not make it

EXCITING SCENES AT
INDUSTRIAL COMMISSION
Chairman Phillips and an Official of
the Standard Oil Company
Nearly Pass the Lie.
WASHINGTON, Sept. B.â At to-day's
session of the Industrial Commission an
animated controversy occurred between
Chairman Phlllipps of the commission and
J. D. Archbold of New York, vice presi
dent of the Standard Oil Company. Mr.
Archbolr 1 . was on the stand replying to
statements â¢ made by J. D. Lee of the
United Pipe Company and other Indepen
dent companies. Referring to Mr. Lee's
statement that the Standard had made
advances to the Pipe Line Company with
a view to buying it out, Mr. Archbold
said:
"Any approaches on that line have come
from the other side," and he proceeded
to say that such advances had been made
not only by Lee, but by others connected
with the Independent lines, Including Mr.
Phillips.
"We have declined their offers." he said,
"because we considered them illegal; and,
: furthermore, because of our lack of faith
in the men from whom the proposition
came, having had previous experience
with them.".
In reply to Mr. Phillips he Bald he did
not claim that the propositions were "un
fair or unjust, but illegal." V-
Mr. Phillips attempted to make a state
: ment* at this point, but was cut off by the
| commission on the ground that he could
at any time take the stand in his own
behalf.
This special incident cloÂ«ed here. Mr.
Archbold several times used the expres
sion, referring to Mr. Lee, who was pres
i ent in the commission's room, "the state
j ment is false, and you know It."

FREE TRADE
RUNS AGROUND
Washed In by the Tide
at Netarts Bay.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
ASTORIA. Sept. B.â News reached this
city to-day that the schooner Free Trad-'.
owned in S;m Francisco, is ashore at
Xi tarts Bay, about forty miles south of
the miiuth of the Columbia River. The
information was brought by the steamer |
E'.more. which arrived this afternoon)
from Tillamook.
Captain Schrader reports that the Free
Trade went ashore while being towed out
of the harbor by the tug Maggie. The
weather was quite calm at the time, but
the tide set In strongly toward shore and
both tug and schooner were carried onto
the beach.
As the Elmore passed the scene of the
accident an effort was being made to float
the vessels, but it had proved unsuccess
ful. It is thought, however, that both
vessels will be floated without damage.
IMPROVEMENTS AT
PEARL HARBOR, HAWAII
WASHINGTON, Sept. B.â Admiral Brad
ford, chief of the Bureau of Equipment,
and General Wilson, chief of engineers,
have been consulting respecting the im
provement of Pearl harbor, Hawaii, with
a view to the establishment of a naval
station there, as directed by Congress.
An unexpected and Bej_ous obstacle to the
execution of the project has been encoun
tered In the shape of refractory real estate
holders. Having exhausted all other
proper methods, the officials have deter
mined now to proceed to acquire the
necessary lands through condemnation
proceedings, having satisfied themselves
that this can bo accomplished through
the Hawaiian laws aa they stand to-day.
The Navy Department has Just received
the detailed survey of Pearl harbor, made
laHt year by the Bennlngton. It Is far
morn complete than anything before un
dertaken, and one result of a study of this
survey has been to satisfy the engineer
officers that a good deal of unforeseen
work must be done In strengthening the
channels connecting the harbor with the

SESSION OF
THE FILIPINO
CONGRESS
Extraordinary Meeting of the
Body Called by President
Aguinaldo.
CHOSE NEW OFFICERS
Decree Is Issued Compelling All
Foreigners Within the Territory
to Be Registered.
Special Cable in The Cull ami New York Her
ald. Copyrighted, 1890, by James Gordon
Bennett.
MANILA, Sept. s.â A Filipino who has
arrived her*- from Tarlac says an extra
ordinary session of the revolutionary
congress took place at Tarlac on August
24. Aguinaldo presided and cljose Ma
bini as president of the Supreme Court
and Gonzaga as Attorney General. They
both represent the most conservative and
temperate element.
Mabini, who recently resigned the I< or
eign Secretaryship, is the ablest man con
nected with the revolution. Gonzaga was
president of the last peace commission. â 
The proceedings of the congress dis
proved the report that Aguinaldo had de
clared himself dictator. A decree has been
issued by the Filipinos compelling the reg
istration of all foreigners in Filipino ter
ritory.- The Chinese, who are a large
fraction of the population, are considered
foreigners, including those born in the
Philippine Islands. Application must be
made on stamped paper, which figures
largely in all the business of the insur
rectionary government. This seems to
be largely a scheme to tax Chinamen.

cruit. The station was opened August
29. in charge of Private Baldwin, and in
two days seventeen applicants had been
examined and five accepted. Mr. Murphy
went up yesterday to swear the men in.
but none appeared and Baldwin went out
and brought them to the office. They re
fused to take the oath.
One of them said: "Mj friends have
been talking to me and tHlin^ me the
Americans oughi not to have anything to
do with the war over there In the Phil
ippines. They told me those fellows
ought to be given a chance to be their
own bosses, and this country is not
ing them a square deal in fighting them.
All the folks here foel that way, and it
will Ro hard with US fellows if we go
into the army to ro over to the Philip
pines. A lot of my friends tell me it" I
go people here won't have anything more
to do with me. and f guess [ won't po."

CABINET DISCUSSES
THE PHILIPPINES
WASHINGTON. Sept. B.â The Cabinet
meeting to-day whs devoted almost en
tirely to a discussion of the local govern
ment which will be ePtabllsht-d in the
Philippines on the cessation of hostllltU-s.
Secretary Root has given the matter
much thought, .mil his views as exprf-s^ed
at the meeting to-day wen- received with
approval by .-ill of the members present.
H~ pointed out that a system of govern
ment wlilih wmild be suited to the people
of Luzon would hardly do for some of the
other Islands, where the inhabitants were
far less advanced, A member of the Cab
inet, in speaking of the matter, said that
Secretary Root displayed a broad states
manship and a knowledge of the economic
;iii'i Bocial conditions of the islands. Post
master General Smith spoke briefly to the
effect that there was an increasing de
mand in Cube and Porto Rico for money
order facilities and a surprising growth
in the receipts of the Postal Department,
which was expected to mean n rapid Im
provement in business through the island.
RAPID FIRE GUNS TO BE
SENT TO THE PHILIPPINES
WASHINGTON, Sept. B.â Some months
ago General Miles recommended the pur
chase of a number of rapid-fire guns for
use In the Philippines. His recommen
dation was as Presideni of the Hoard of
Ordnanc* and Fortifications. General
Buffiugton, Chief of Ordnance, disap
proved the recommendation.
One reason for the visit of Secretary
Root to Sandy Hook was to see this gun
tested and decide upon its merits. Secre
tary Root, it is said, has decided that
the r?un should be used. It is not known
how many will be sent to the Philip
pines.

CAPE HAYTIEN. Sept. B.â
The town of Monte Christo, in
San Domingo, has surrendered
to the insurgents. Richards left
this morning with an armed
escort for Santiago de Los
Caballero*, San Domingo, to con
sult with Jimenes.
M<Â»('.\. Fan Domingro, Sept. B.âGen
eral Jimenes arrived this afternoon at
Moca with an escort of 500 cavalry,
largely augmented by armed horsemen
from the villages along the route.
Everywhere the utmost enthusiasm
is displayed.
It was here that the late President
Heureaux was killed by Ramon
Caceres, who is now the idol of the
President and the Minister of War in
the provisional government. The con
spirators claim that they have secured
a list of persons whom Heureaux had
designated for execution.
General Jimenes has received a dis
patch from a Parisian banking house
promising to furnish all the funds ne
cessary to establish the government,
the French interests being second only
to the American. He will proceed to
La Vega to-night.
KIXCSTOX, Jamaica, Sept. B.âDo
minican mail advices just received
here say that the apparently en
thusiastic and ostensibly national dem
onstration prepared in San Doming"
for Juan Isidro Jimenes, the leader of
the revolution in that country, by Gen
eral Imber and the leaders of Jimenes'
immediate political faction, is alto
gether representative of the real pop
ular sentiment. It is now beginning to
appear that while the whole nation ac
cepted the revolution on the tacit un
derstanding that the intolerable in
cubus of party politics would be per
manently removed by securing an
American protectorate, Jimenes' party
were finally working for his personal
interests, to the establishment of which
they now purpose utilizing the victory
if they can compass his constitutional
election.
In spitp of the growing popularity of
General Horacio Vasquez. the pro
visional vice president, who war- the
real leader of the revolution and is the
real hero of the hour, the advices add
that unless the person elected either
adopts the popular aspirations, or. as
an alternative, succeeds in giving the
country immediately an administra
tion combining sovereign independence
with that financial stability, industrial
progress and complete international
political freedom to which it has so
long been a stranger, and which the
people are fully determined to secure
at any cost of bloodshed or even a par
tial surrender of sovereignty, another
revolution is sure to follow.
In conclusion the advices say thÃt
the foreign interests in San Domingo
are watching the developments with
the keenest anxiety.

INDIA CHANGES
MONEY STANDARD
Gold to Be Made Legal

Special OaMe to Thp Call and New York Her
ai.J. Copyrighted, 1599. by James (jordon
I'onneti.
SIMLA. Sept. s.â At yesterday's session
of the Indian Council the Viceroy, Baron
Curznnoi' Kaddlestoni concurring in the
statement of Clinton Dawkins, the finan
cial member who introduced the currency
bill; said that in the absence of the. mint
proclamation from England it had been
decided to make 50... the legal tender im
mediately. In the conviction that no other
measure would save India from disastrous
embarrassment and fresh taxation, re
marking that; thanks to the sagacity and
the common sense of the committee, the
ability of the chairman, the strength of
the cape for the p<>l<! standard, and the
remarkable consensus of opinion, a con
clusion of u.e fiercely disputed matter had
been reached. For twenty years the pol
icy of the Government hail been the de
fense of India from the inevitable conse
quences of a decline in the value of the
rupee, namely, fresh taxation.
ThÂ«^ adoption c,f a gold standard would
enable India to embark in competition
with foreign powers am! enter the field on
equal terms. Since gold began to enter last
year Â£2.620.000 nad arrived. A fixed value
must lend stability and confidence to for
eign trade. He did not Indulge in chimer
ical dr-ams of me future or pretend to
op-n an Asiatic Klondike. He firmly be
lieved und hoped the present action wou.d
Invest the financial horoscope of India
with the security which it had hitherto
lacked, and which it was the duty of the
Government to utilize in the efforts of the
Indian people. ,
The Pope is one of the world's million
aires. The gold objects stored In the Vat
ican are estimated by weight alone to be
worth $25.000,000. â^â .

England builds her docks for eternity,
while we build for time."
Following are some of the innovations
Mr. Foss will advocate, and several of |
them are likely to be embodied in bills
to be presented to Congress next winter:
A naval policy board, to formulate a |
harmonious plan of naval construction, to
run through a series of years; a great
system of national naval reserves;
new naval administration for navy
yards; naval barracks for seamen ashore; j
new system of rewards for deeds of hero
ism, perhaps by awards of medals, similar
to foreign decorations; a system of stone
docks.
"Our navy Is in its infancy." explained
Mr. Foss. "It is being built piecemeal
and without any defined programme. The
plan of one year may be changed by Con- i
gress next year. There should â¢â >â¢ a board !
of naval expert to determine what kind
of navy the United States should have,
and formulate a plan of construction that
should extend over a number of years.
Such a system would give a navy built
for specific ends and on harmonious, well
balanced lines, with due proportions of
various tt-nes of war vessels. The recom
mendations of such a board would com
mand the confidence of Congress and
would save that body much experimenting
and blundering. 1 would like to see Ad
miral Dewey a; the head of such a board.
I have become convinced that the Amer
ican people want a groat navy and that
they will give money freely to build one,
but we should not go on in our old hap
hazard way. x.ii. is the time for a well
defined system. European nations have
greater experience than we because they
have larger navies ..." we can easily get
the benefit of their tests and their mis
takes ant! trliirrmns."

ANOTHER GLIMPSE OF

Mysterious Vessel Sighted Off Cape
Flattery by the Steamer
Warrimoo.
VICTORIA. B. C, Sept. S.â The sup
posed derelict which is wandering- up and
down the west coast has again been
sighted. The steamer Warrimoo reports
seeing a barkentine at !> p. m. yesterday
150 miles southwest by west of Cape Flat
tery, and when a description was fur
nished some of the steamer's officers de
clared her to be the same wanderer seen
on the coast last at Hesquolt *on Au
gust 20.
She is a wooden bark and was running
in a northeasterly direction. The purser
nports that her fore and main top gallant
masts were gone, but other officers, who
an- inclined to doubt that the vessel seen
was the derelict, say the masts were
probably lowered because of the light
prevailing winds. If it was the vagrant
ship seen at Clayoquot and Hesquoit she
has traveled southwesterly for a consider
able distance since she was last seen
eighteen days ago.

"THIS ACCURSED WAR
SHOULD BE STOPPED"
Sentiment Expressed by Major General Lawton
in an Interview With Rev. Peter
Maoqueen. _
NEW YORK, Sept. S.â Rev. Peter Mac
queen, now in the Philippines, has writ
ten for the Congregationallist an Interest-
Ing review of the religious situation in the
islands, and in this review he quotes Gen
eral Lawton as declaring that "what we
â want is to stop this accursed war," and
that it is time for diplomacy and mutual
understandings. From General Otis Rev.
Mr. Macqueen obtained an interview, in
which the general said:
"As far as the present state of religious
progress among the natives is concerned
the people have gained more from the
work of priests and friars than is usually
supposed. There are many abuses among
the friars, I have no doubt. They hold
land to-day much of which has been ac
quired contrary to the decree of the Coun
cil of Trent and the rules of the Catholic
Church in Spain. Holy orders own half
the real estate in Manila and nearly all
the property in the region of Laguna de
Bai.
"They do not allow Filipino priests to
be settled over parishes. This causi
end of friction. They have had complete
control of education. It is nut so bad an
educational system as it might be. They
want their schools re-established, and a
delegation is waiting just n Â»w for me in
regard to th.-ir schools. J must look out
for them."
In regard to :'n>- establishment of Prot
estant missions in these Islands hej will
have hard and stony ground. Filipinos
are all earnest Catholics and an:, attempt
at proselyting ihem would stir in, their
anger against Americans, who they would
accuse of trying to take away their re
ligion as well us their liberty. I think in
time Protestantirm will be good for such
of them as rare to worship that way,
but as things are now it would only stir
up their animosity."
Rev. Mr. Macqueen had a long interview
with General Lawton, wi;<> praised the
Filipinos as a "very fine set of soldiers,"
and far better than Indians.
"Taking everything into consideration,"
said Genera] Lawton. "tht- few facilities
they have and the many drawbacks, they
are a very ingenious and artistic race.
And taking intu account the disadvan
tages they have to fight against in arms,
equipment and military discipline, with
out artillery, short of ammunition, their
PACKERS OFFER GOOD
PRICE FOR SALMON
' Two Cents the Rate Named, but There
Are Prospects of an
Increase.
ASTORIA. Sept. B.â At a meeting of rep
resentatives of the several local salmon
packing concerns. Including the packers"
trust, last night the price of fall salmon
was fixed at 2 cents a pound. The under
standing between the packers was that
this figure should prevail ;>i th.- opening
of the season, and it is effective only so
long: as the canners wish to pay it.
This price is the highest voluntarily
offered fishermen for years. Lasi year
1 cent was paid for a time, but the price
dropped later to three-quarters of a cent.
The - cents offered this season is for
silverside salmon and the- best quality of
chinook fish, inferior salmon bringing a
lower price. Fishermen art- elated and
look forward to a prosperous season.
The high offer of the packers is another
result Of the advent of cold-storage estab
lishments. These concerns wilh offer a
â  tritle more than the canners. -just enough
! to insure them a goodly supply, so the
! price may go up still further as the sea

PATENT ON THE PLAN
OF USING OIL ON ROADS
! F. W. Mattern Will File Suit Against
the Supervisors of Santa
Barbara.
.SANTA BARBARA, Sept. B.â F. W.
Mattern, the man who has a patent for
sprinkling streets with old, no matter how
it is done, is in Santa Barbara and ready
to begin injunction proceedings against
the Board of Supervisors, enjoining them
I from the further use of oil on the county
\ roads.
Several weeks ago Mattern came here
' and made similar threats, but the Super
visors took no notice of them, and were
i afterward informed by the Assistant
i United States Roads Commissioner that
1 no such patent had been obtained, nor
i had any one attempted to get any. He
! said that in his opinion a patent on oiling
i the streets could no more be obtained than
i one could patent the waters of the Poto
i mac. Now it appears that Mattern has
i been collecting toll from all companies,
: cities or individuals who have been using
i oil for this purpose all over the United
States.
A. P. Greeley, the Assistant Commis
sioner, has written again that he was
I mistaken, and that Mattern got his patent
! in April. ISPS. Mattern will sue the county
| for the right to use his patent, and, fur
thermore, he will sue for damages. He is
backed up by the Philadelphia Dustless
Roads Company. It is said that several

"Filipinos arf not military by nature.
They are rather domestic in tastes and
habits, peace loving and industrious.
Nine-tenths of the people of the islands
; will strongly favor peace, even at the ex
pense of some of their theories, wishes
and hopes.
"1 believe that with a liberal govern
ment, such as the United States can and
will establish, they will be a peaceful,
thrifty, bappy people. I believe it was
: a greal misfortune that we were not able
! !<â  give them a chance to sample our
! government before hostilities opened. The.
: only thing we have to fear is from ambi
tious youths, who want to obtain control
for financial reasons, that they may prac
tice what th.- Spanish have taught them.
"Among the Filipinos there are many
cultured people who would ornament i â

studied and traveled; men who have

GROWING BELIEF THAT
LANDIS WAS MURDERED
Bullet Found in the Ceiling Was i
Not Fired From His
Pistol.
LINCOLN. Sept. B.â There is now no!
doubt that Frank Landis. the young Lin
coln merchant who was found dead In the ;
luck room of his store on August 'j, met |
with foul play. The case has been under !
investigation by Pinkerton detectives j
! hired by the citizens to unravel the mys- !
it-ry, and their findings point unmistak
ably to murder.
i''Â«ng Ldtidis was killed by a bullet
from a. 38-caliber revolver*, and thÂ£rfact 'â 
th.it his own pistol of the same T^ilmt :
was found within six rV.-t of Ins body lent '
color to the suicide theory. A 38-caliher :
bull-'t was found in the stairway above '
the body, and it was the opinion of the i
countj officers ihni Land is iir.-d it from
hia pistol to avert suspicion of suicide; re- |
loaded his weapon and discharged a sec- I
end bullet into his heart.
It has now been discovered that the bul- !
let found in the stairway; although a &>- i
c;;h'ber. c<>u! ( ] not have been nred by I
Landis' revolver. It belonged to a cheaper
weapon and was evidently used by a'see-i
ond party. A lamp which Is r usually
lighted In the store at night was seen
burning at 9:30 on the evening of the mur
der, but at 10:37 several people noticed
that it was extinguished. This was before
Landis entered the store. Two parties j

that of falling packing boxes in the rear!

$ Four years ago he had typhoid fever. Since then he has not spoken a Â©

O He wandered away from home a few weeks ago and when the policemen O
â¦ saw him he ran like a deer. When caught he said never a word. The â¦
5 police tried to frighten him by remarking that they believed he was %

TROUBLE OVER
OLAA LANDS
â¦ 7
Squatters Will Fight for
Possession.
â¦â 
Special Dispatch to The Call.
VICTORIA, B. C, Sept. B.â According
to news received from Honolulu by the
Warrimoo, a public sale of Government
lands shortly to be held there. Will be pro
ductive of no small amount of trouble.
The Olaa squatters, a band of settlers
who have squatted on some rich fertile
Government land on Hawaii, have formed
an association and will light to the bitter
j end to retain the land they have seized.
j The association, which has been named
"The American Settlers' Association," is
i running an advertisement in the Honolulu
: papers giving notice to any who intend
j purchasing the land settled on by them
] of prior claims to it. and that a title to
! the land from the Hawaiian Government
, will, be disputed by them.
The lands under dispute are recently
i surveyed lands In the district of Olaa,
on the island of Hawaii. The Govern
ment intended to open them up to home
steaders under the Hawaiian land laws.
The squatters claim that by the New
lands resolution all public lands of Ha
waii became public lands of the United
! States and do disposition can be made of
'â  them except by act of Congress. The
! sale will not be held until the Washing
ton authorities can be communicated
with.
The squatters hold 'that a judgment
] given by Assistant Attorney General Van
j Deventer, on July 26, â ' supports their con
: tention. The claim of would-be settlers
in a nutshell is, that when they came on
1 the lands they were unoccupied Govern
| ment lands and they have taken them as
I such and made the improvements called
for under the United States laws in this
regard, intending, as soon as the United
States land laws are enforced in the isl
ands, to complete their title. The land in
volved consists of between 6000 . and "COO
acros, which is said to be worth from one
to two hundred dollars per acre, so. that
the amount Involved taking the valuation
of the land at an average figure will not
be far short of. a million dollars.

HARRY SAMUELS AND
META ASHER CONCERT
The musical season was opened under
the most auspicious circumstances at
Rherman-Clay Hall on Thursday, when
Miss Meta Asher and Harry Samuels
made their initial bow after their return
fn.m abroad, where they spent several
years in study with some of the foremost
masters. Every available space was oc- j
1. which was a compliment to the |
Lgerial ability of Sir Henry Heyman, .
under whose direction the concert was j
given. It was a most flattering tribute to
the young, artists that the audience con
sisted of San Francisco's foremost music
lovers ajid included many members of thu |
"swell" set. Both young musicians have
reason to feel proud of the cordial re
ception accorded them.
The playing of the beneficiaries soon
showed that they were fully entitled to
ration bestowed upon them. Harry
Bamuels demonstrnfil that he had not I
. . ;i remarkably flueni technique and a j
iind sure attack, but that he lists an i
c temperameni which manifests It
effective and intelligent execution,
i tone Is large and commanding and
I is legato and staccato passages are ;
ered with refreshing accuracy. While |
idered every number In a highly |
.ible. manner, it will not be a mistake
I >'lect the "Faust" fantasia as his
achievement, for herein the tech
intricacles and emphatic sentiment
. manded the skill of the artist as well
as the phenomenal memory of the genius.
Any one willing to give credit to those;
who deserve it will not be unwilling to ,
acknowledge- the urti-tic superiority of j
Harry Samuels as a violinist. It reflects j
much credit upon Sir Henry Heyman |
that this yi/ung man was his pupil, and i
touched off a bunch or red fire and the
parade started. It marched as follows:

Not less than 2000 men were in line â
maybe more. Down .Mason to Market
it marched, headed by a wagon t-pout
ing red fire, and down Market to the
ferry, crowds on both sides of the
street cheering as. they passed. Cali
fornia Parlor, the banner parlor of the
organization, which had the honor of
furnishing tho grand marshal for the
parade, led the way for the other na
tives. For one reason and another it
made a small turnout, hardly exceeding
in number the band preceding it with
its drums and its dozen pair of lungs
announcing- the now familiar "Hot
Time." In spite of lack of numbers,
however, it marched jauntily with the
knowledge that It would be reinforced
to-day in such numbers as to make far
from a poor showing In the big Admis
sion day parade.
Mission Parlor No. 3t5, which followed
next, was strong in number, its mem
bers beautifully badged for the occa
sion. Immediately on their heels came
the band of the First California Vol
- Regiment, leading the members
af Golden Gate Parlor No. 29. who car-
he must fppl nrmifl to find him returr
from his studies abroad endowed with
such talent ami efficiency.
Miss Meta Asher lias acquired a splen
did control <>f the technical difficulties
demanded by the advanced pianist. Bar
ring a little nervousness, which always
ereÂ« ps into the first pieces of a pro
gramme, th^ young lady did not by any
means disappoint those of her admirera
who expected to find her a splendidly
equipped musician. She takf-s= proat paina
In coloring her recital and she seems en
dowed with a natural p"Â»-tic t.-mperament
which assists her greatly In Interpi
hrr pieces with musiclanly taste. Her
ition is <-lt-an and Intellectual. Her
attack is firm and yet Boft, ilÂ«-r Chopin
â¢ions were no doubt her best work of
thÂ« evening.

CANTEEN BILLS.
One of the things brought back by the
First California Regiment from the
islands Is a debt on the canteen account.
which the officers of the command are
now trying to adjust. When the rai
ment was In Manila flÃhr of the com
panies went into a canteen scheme. The
plan was all right as a scheme, but not
as a business proposition, and when the
regiment was ordered to Negros the can
teen was somewhere near Si'oo in debt.
First one battalion was ordered away and
then another, and in ihf hurry of depar
ture find the general mixup incident to
the separation of the companies the ac
counts of th<Â» canteen got In a bad tangle.
The canteen was run by a board of ofll
cers consisting of Captain O'Xell, Cap
tain Connolly and Lieutenant McGurren.
Lieutenant McGurren was the canteen
officer and he did all the purchasing.
When the regiment came together again,
one of the principal matters it partially
settled up was tho canteen account, but
when it left Manila there was still due
to the American Commercial Company
$900 Mexican, or less than $5'XÂ» in coin of
this realm.
There have been several officers meet
ings to decide in what way this money
shall be made good, but in it all there
Is no preposition to place the blame upon
Lieutenant McGurren.
The money will have to be raised by
assessment or some similar way, but that
it Will be secured is certain. The regi
ment lias had the benefit of all money Â« x
nended and all supplies purchased. There
are some outstanding accounts and some
of the property of the canteen was lost.
Both of these items are included in the
bill outstanding. The matter will be set
tled before the regiment has been mus
tered, out. ,

CHINESE GAMBLERS RAIDED.
Twenty-Nine Wily Celestials Are
Taken Into Custody by the
Chinatown Squad.
While Sergeant Puke -was absent from
his district in Chinatown last night tele
phoning nice things about himself to a
morning newspaper th<- squad he is sup
posed to lead raided Tie Gow's fan-tan
gam.- at 819 Washington street.
As a result of the raid twenty-nine
gamblers were captured along with their
complete paraphernalia an<3 $68 in coin.
Tie Cows place is known as the I'nion
League Club of Chinatown a.!"! has given
the police trouble for a long time on ac
count of the i !< verness in which Its man
agers and members have eluded arrest.
It has been the custom of the players
to place their gambling outfit in a safe
the moment the bluecoats were spotted
by the lookout, thus leaving no evidence
in sight by which they could be taken
Into court. This trick w:is repeated last
night by the wily Chinese, but this time
it did not work, for the reason that one
of the officers had had the forethought
to provide himself with a search warrant.
By virtue of this, the safe was opened
and the paraphernalia secured. The cap
tured Chinese were escorted to the Cali
fornia-street station.
Husband Lost in the Klondike
Two years ago J. Brown, a laborer,
went to the Klondike in the hope of Im
proving his worldly condition. For a while
he wrote and sent money to his wife and
little ones, now living at 713^ Minna
street. He stated that he was doing fairly
well. Finally the letters and remittances
ceased to come, and the family is now in
destitute circumstances. Mrs. Brown has
requested Secretary Beanson of the Eu
reka Society for the Protection of Chil
dren to help her ascertain if the husband
and father is dead or alive. Mrs. Beanson
lias written to the police of Dawson for
information.
Must Pay the Judgment.
William Belycft and J. C. Rodgers en
tered into a written contract with Mrs. L.
M. Bigelow to construct a building of
eight Hats for her on Bush street. The
work was sub-contracted to C. A. Ma
comber, John Tuttle and J. C. Reid, who
furnished the material and performed the
labor. The latter filed mechanics' lien." on
the property, consolidated their suits and
received judgment for the amount due.
The case was appealed to the Supreme
Court, and yesterday an opinion was
handed down affirming the Judgment of
the lower court.
HEADED FOR
SANTA CRUZ
RAWHIDE MINE SUIT.
The Owners Win â Sale by George M.
Pinney Set Aside.
News comes from Boston that yesterday
the. Supreme Court of Massachusetts up
held the judgment rendered by the lower
court in favor of Nevilla, Martin and Bal
lard, the owners of the Rawhide mine,
and against Norton, Pinney and associ
ates, the opinion holding that the sale of
the mine which George M. Pinney pre
tended to make to one Norton was illegal
and void.
The facts as shown on the trial of the
case are that some four or five years ago
George M. Pinney, who is not entirely
unknown In this State, induced the own
ers of the Rawhide mine to give him a
letter of attorney to sell their stock on
the Boston Mining Board upon certain
terms and conditions, one of which wa.s
that all sales of the stock should be for
cash and the money be turned into a
bank in Boston for the owners, it being
agreed that this bank should hold the
stock until it was sold. Pinney was a
mere broker to find customers and was
not Intrusted with the stock or the money
coming from the sales. Not long after
this arrangement there was a big im
provement in the mine, and Pinney, as
suming to act for the owners, made an
agreement with Norton to sell him the
whole stock upon eight or nine months'
lime. Th<Â» owners promptly repudiated
this transaction, claiming that Norton was
a man of straw and that the whole busi
ness had been concocted by Pinney and
his confederates, including one Pierre
Humbert Jr., to cheat and defraud his
principals. Suit wa.s thereupon brought
against the owners for damages on ac
count of refusing to carry out this Illegal
snle, which has now been finally dvclaed
against Norton and his associates.

contest become the property of the uni-
I versity Regents, but what disposition will
be made of them has not as yet been defi
nitely decided. The Benard plans, which

KENVILLE IS ACQUITTED.
Policeman Frank Kenville. who was
charged with having fractured the "kull
of little Willie Lynch, on the evening of
September : V M last in front of Wood
ward's Pavilion, was acquitted \esterday
by a jury in Judge Cook"s court He was
charged with .in a?sauit to comnit mur
der, but the Jury decided that he was un
justly accused, and sot him free.
On the night of the assault charged.
Willie Lynch, with a number of
companions, was playing in the vicinity
of the pavilion. Kcnville ordered them
away, and as they did not obey he hurled
his club among: them. Willie Lynch was
picked up In an unconscious condition and
examination disclosed the fact that he
had sustained a fracture of the skull.
Citizens who saw the boy fall took- the
stand during the trial of Kenville and
swore that he threw the club that injured
the boy for life. On the other hand, the
defense proved that some stones had been
thrown into the crowd during the even-
Ing and that if the wound was not caused
by one of the stones they claimed that
the lad received his hurts by failing to

ROSENBERG COMPLAINS.
Seeks the Arrest of the Managers of
the Union Iron Works.
Secretary Rosenberg of the Federated i
Trades Council called at the office ofj
United States Attorney Coombs yester- I
day and asked that a complaint be drawn
against the managers of the Union Iron
Works for violating the Federal eight
hour law. He said that men working en
the Government transport Hancock were
obliged to labor ton hours each day.
Assistant United States Attorney Ban
ning, to whom the complaint was made,
requested Mr. Rosenberg to call on Mon
day, as he df sired to occupy the interven-
Ing period in examining authorities as to
whether the Federal eight-hour law ap
plied to work on Government transports
In time of war. The statutp prohibits the 'â 
employment of laborers and mechanics on
Government work for more than eight
hours per day, "except in cases of extra
ordinary emergency."
Mr. Banning has written a letter to the
managers of the Union Iron "Works noti

C. Cardella. a blacksmith, and William

rests, showed that Sunday evening the
defendants were In a dog cart and that
they drcve over the railroad crossing at
Twenty-ninth street at a fast gait, which ;
was against the law. They chased them

in massing itself in such numbers as

II took nearly twenty minutes for the

the ferry depot, with every step

As the head of the line crossed East
I street numerous whistles nn the watr-r

Ten minutes were left in which to

I natives made things hum in the ferry

that they accomplished their purpose.

SANTA ORFZ, Sept. 9. 12:15 a. m.â The

rived at 12:10 this morning. Two other
trains followed. They were received by
the local parior with a band. A proces

morning the streets wore crowded.
FRENNA HELD TO ANSWER.
Judge Graham Decides Ha Must Be
Tried for the Turner
Killing.
Joseph Frenna was held to answer for
the murder of James F. Turner yester
day by Judge Graham. The court had the
matter under advisement for several days
and when the case was called yesterday
said that after reviewing the evidence
he had concluded that the crime of mur
der had been committed and that there
was sufficient testimony to warrant the
belief that the defendant was guilty
thereof. Bail was fixed in the sum of
ISOOO.
Attorney George D. Collins objected
strenuously to admitting the defendant
to bail, and at once filed an affidavit be
fore Superior Judge Daingerfield upon
which a writ of certiorari was issued, re
turnable before Judge Lawler at 8 o'clock
last evening. At that time Attorney John
A. Hosmer attempted to file a demurrer
to the writ, but Attorney Collins object
ed, and after lengthy argument the court
refused to allow the respondent to in
terpose the demurrer. The case went
over until next Monday afternoon at 4
o'clock. In the meantime Frenna will
have to remain in jail, although he has
bondsmen ready to qualify in the sum
fixed by Judge Graham.
Dameron Will Contested.
Mar}' E. Morgan yesterday filed a con
teat to the will of James M. Dameron,
who died in Stockton February 4, 1599,
The contestant avers that when the de
ceased executed the testament he was . f
unsound mind, and <i!.=c that m illegal
trust is established. Dameron prove*
the language of his will thai he \\a^ i -
centric. He asked that his body b? cre
mated and the ashes spread on the flower
beds of the park, as they would make the
flowers grow.
These manifestations of eccentricity are
declared to be evidence of insanity of
such degTee as to incapacitate him from
making a legal- testament, and hence tne
contest was filed by a disinherited heir.

"THE REAL HAWAII."
L T NDER the above title Lieutenant Young of the ,
I navy lias pubiished a book which he wrote
' some time ago. He was on the Boston at
rionolulu with Captain VViltse when the landing
jarty from that ship was sent ashore to effect a revo
â¢ution against a government with which ours was :ti
:
The book is a defense of Minister Stevens and
VViltse. An officer of the navy cann* it
Â»sh without consent of the department, and this was
vithheld from Lieutenant Young during the Cieve
and administration, and for the honor of the service
md the country the prohibition should have been
jermanent.
That Minister Steve:i = was for nearly a year con
ipiring to bring about the revolution of 1893 is proved
Â»y his own official correspondence, to be in the
Btate Department at Washington. He reported that
;ix months before the outbreak he had persuade 1 the
slanters not to demand the full two cents a pound
county on their sugar when annexed to the United
states, but to accept less. The Boston was present
n Honolulu harbor for the purpose she fulfilled when
he blow was struck. With Honolulu in the hands of
he conspirators and the lawful government their

rith Gatlings "'to protect American interests!"
\gainst whom? There was no bre.ich of the peace
:xcept what Nfinister Stevens had pb.nned, and there
vere no disturbers of the peace except the conspira
ors who had overthrown the government. Lieuten
int Y'<nng may write many books; the facts of bis
on,' will remain unchanged. His present effort,
lowever. doe? not derive its singular infamy from its
ittempt to miswrite public history. It is boasted by
lim and his friends that it is "a bitter book." It
ittacks the private life of the ex-Queen and of all the
nembers of the royal family. It is said that "in these
he author speaks of things he has seen with his own
tyes, and affirms them on the honor of an officer and
. gentleman." Of an officer, perhaps; but of a gen
leman, no. A gentleman could have had no means
tf knowing the truth of some things he tells. Men
tho are not gentlemen may have knowledge j
â¢f that kind, and the evidence that they are not gen
lemen is their publication of it. To this rule we
hink there is no exception.
The book attacks the native Hawaiian? en masse,
without discrimination. Those people have been de
poiled of their birthright, their country taken from
hem, and the Christian civilization carried to them
md trustingly accepted by them has proved the most j
teartless robber that ever violated the rights of the j
teak. Why not let them alone? Is it any mark of
rallantry in a naval officer to assail them in their
orrow and add to the forcible seizure of their coun
ry and their treatment as aliens on their native soil
he abuse of a gossiper whose ideas of right and
rrong are as confused as his conception of what con
titutes the honor of a gentleman?
This country will be glad to forget the final result
if the missionary civilization in Hawaii. It will be
;lad to close its eyes to the spectacle of a people who
ccepted Christianity and with it its parasitic vices
hat destroy faster than it can save. And it will be
[lad to dismiss from memory the scene of that peo
ile pitifully quoting the Golden Rule and the Deca-
Dgue while they were the helpless victims of the
â¢iolation of both at the hands of the very men from
rhom they had learned them. Lieutenant Young's
ook should have remained suppressed.
A wave of morality has swept over San Rafael. The
iood citizens of the little town intend to keep sober
ftcr 11 o'clock at night. At the next meeting of
he Board of Trustees a resolution making the sale
i liquor after that hour a misdemeanor will be sub
litted for adoption.
While from this side of the world it appears as if
he Boers and the British are making ready for war,
hey insist that they are only "preparing for even
aalities."
The search of the local Democratic committee for
len willing to run on the "Jasper" ticket for Super
isors seems to be all moonshine. At any rate it
t a still hunt.
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 0. 1599.
BRYAN AS A SHOW.
IT is becoming less easy to avoid seeing the hu
morous side of Colonel Bryan's itinerant and
oratorical chase tor the Presidency. In 1896,
when he was in the enemy's country for the purpose
of being told that he was a nominee for the Presi
dency, it was reported that he encountered a small
company of villagers 0:1 the banks of the Hudson
and immediately proceeded to make a speech. After
explaining who he was he told them that whenever he
saw two or three people gathered together the temp
tation to make a speech to them was irresistible.
There is something exquisitely funny in this desire
to declaim on all occasions. The country knows
?\lr. Bryan only as posing before an audience of "fel
'â¢ w citizens" and gesticulating in time to his voice
of warning. The late Mrs. Jeremiah Cruncher's
tendency to "flop" was nothing to Mr. Bryan's spell
binding habit. On emerging from the Yosemite the
other day his vice overtook him at Wawona. He
had not had a relapse after leaving Stockton on the
way up. and three days' abstinence had made it
necessary for him to utter himself.
The reception committee appointed to escort him
was there, acting as pall-bearers. These and the
cooks, waiters and chambermaids, hostlers and
drivers, who are necessary to the administration of
Washburn's Hotel and stage line, made a company
â¢ brought on an oratorical fit, and Bryan had to
â¢:â  Cunningham was there listening
a critic's ear and reminded, by the hour and a
half of word.-, that in selling onions to foreign tour
ist 1 ; for the Lady Washington Lily bulbs he is not the
only faker on the road.
Uncle Jim Lawrence was aiso in the audience,
blind of an eye. but able to see the holes in a ladder.
Mr. Bryan announced his subject to be "The Beau
ties of the Yosemite, and Observations on Politics."
The reporters who were present have preserved
of it. but contented themselves with intimating
that he held his audience spellbound.
The speech, therefore, seems to have been like the
most of those delivered by Mr. Bryan. There was no
thought in it that sticks and stays. It is a remark
able testimony to his physical endurance that he has
fip.ee 1896 been almost ceaselessly talking, and has
said nothing that is remembered, nothing that has
sunk into the public mind and memory to be readily
recalled and quoted by his followers. He has given
his mind a long rest and has taken an intellectual
vacation by talking. The professional orator has no
immortality unless he has a message to deliver, an
idea to clothe in proper verbiage. The country can
recall the ideas of Sumner, Blame, Edward Everett,
Conkling, Injjersoll, Wendell Phillips and Lincoln in
the phrase that expressed them. They impressed a
cotemporary generation and passed into folklore
and popular tradition. Mr. Bryan is exceedingly
cotemporary with this present generation. He is ex
tremely convenient and chronically in evidence. lie
has talked more and said less than any present or
past jobster at oratory, and the transitory mark he
has made is evidenced by the few "remains" he has
left in the public- memory. He lacks in originality.
As an adapter he has some skill. He adapted his
free silver ideas from poor Dirk Bland, and by
veneering them with some vocal soapsuds took from
Bland a Presidential nomination to which he was
fairly entitled. He has. in like manner, adapted John
Sherman's ideas on trusts, and those of Hoar, Bout
well, Edmunds and Johnson on imperialism, and it
must be confessed he has ensmalled them all to ac
commodate them to the caliber of his oratory.
A close study of Mr. Bryan reveals him as an actor.
He is a born thespian. He approaches every ques
tion with a view to stage effect. His faculty of
adaptation of the ideas of others and his fondness for
dramatic exits and entrances are all the characters
tics of a player. His tendency to begin making a
speech to any crowd he sees marks him a natural
born barnstormer.
The impression he leaves is exactly that produced
by a show. In his progress through the country in
1896 the crowd": that heard him were larger than had
ever listened before to a stump speaker, but where hi?
audiences were largest his vote was the smallest. The
people had gone to a show. They wanted to hear a
"boy orator" aged 40. They heard him. applauded '
him even, went home and voted the other ticket. To
them it was a circus, a passing show. The same
crowds go to "the unparalleled aggregation of bi
ological wonders and agglomeration of mental and
muscular masters of magic and mystery-" but they
don't remember the clown's songs nor take the ring
master' 5 advice in their public or domestic affairs.
So. rising from the circus to the stage, the audience
weeps over Desdemona, though it knows she is not
smothered, and it goes to the tomb in tears with
Juliet, knowing that she will be at her mutton broth
and beer when the play is over.
Mr. Bryan excites just that sort of interest and no
other.
The feeling for him in his audiences is perfectly
sincere of its kind. He is playing a part, does it
fairly well, and earns applause and something more
substantial, and gets both, and there the impression |
ends.
After his next defeat for the Presidency he should
follow his trend and talents and take to the stage. I
His age would be no bar, for his political career has
really been a course of study and practice for the i
sock and buskin. He would get large audiences and
make the fortune of his manager and his own.
There is some hope that the Dunham nightmare |
will soon resolve itself into a disagreeable memory of
a horrifying crime. The search for the Santa Clara !
murderer has sunk to the purposeless seeking for a
skeleton.
THE MINING ENGINEERS.
rROM the assembling in this city of the conven
tion of the American Institute of Mining En
gineers, which is to take place on the 25th of
this month, California has. much to expect. The
men who are to meet on that occasion are the
representatives of the scientific and technical side of
the mining industry, and are among the foremost in
the world in their profession. It is upon their judg
ment capitalists rely in making mining investments.
It is upon their skill mine operators depend for the
solution of the difficult problems of the work.
It is inevitable that when they come to California
these engineers will take a warmer interest in the
mining industries of the State than ever before, and
as a result they will obtain a completer knowledge.
They will go from the State with a fuller and a
clearer idea of the possibilities of California mining
than they had when they came, and it is a foregone
conclusion the reports they make of the prospects of
the mining counties will go far toward attracting to
them the attention of mining capitalists not only in
this country but in Europe.
The institute holds its convention in this State ?.t
the invitation of the California Miners' Association,
and during the time the engineers are in the State
they will be in a certain sense the guests of the asso
ciation. There has been arranged for them a wel
come on the large and liberal scale with which the
California miner has the habit of doing things.
After the three days' session of the convention in the
city the visitors are to be taken on a tour of the min
ing districts of the State from north to south. Two
weeks are to be spent on the trip, which will be at
once an occasion of holiday and of study. Men so
learned and skilled in mines and mining will quickly
understand the meaning of all they see, and there
fore after their inspection they will be fairly wc'l
posted on the conditions and the possibilities of our
mineral industries.
The engineers come to us at a time which is pro
pitious to our hopes of good results from their com
ing. The disturbances in the Transvaal, which
threaten war at any moment and may involve the
destruction of the mines in that state by the enraged
Boers, will naturally force mining capitalists to look
elsewhere for investments until that trouble is over.
Under such circumstances renewed attention will be
given to California, and the meeting here of the lead
ing mining experts of the country will be made the
occasion of something more than a cursory study of
our undeveloped mineral resources. There are good
reasons for believing California still offers better in
ducements for mining investments than any other
legion of the earth, and the visit of the engineers
will help to make tho^e inducements known.
Prince Henry recently went to an important
Korean seaport town, entertained extravagantly, ami
then politely asked for a railway concession that
would have worked serious harm to Korea. He was
as politely refused. Prince Henry must have thought
that he was dealing with some French army officers.
COLMA INCORPORATION SCHEME
1 ZZJ VER since the Supervisors in response to popu
lar demand closed up the gambling which
under the pretense of racing had been carried j
on at Ingleside Park, the gamblers, with all their fol- j
lowing, have been seeking a means to resume their I
nefarious but profitable trade at some point near j
enough to San Francisco to enable them to drain the ;
pockets of dupes in the future as in the past.
An effort was made to obtain from the Supervisors
of San Mateo licenses for poolrooms to be run in
connection with a racetrack in that county, but the ef
fort failed. A bolder scheme has now been undertaken.
It is the purpose of the gamblers and their Sausalito i
allies to bring about, if possible, the incorporation of j
Colma as a town, their expectation being that the j
government would be in the hands of their too!?, i
and that all license for gambling they desire would j
be readily granted them within the town limits.
For the purpose of bringing about the incorpora
tion a good deal of canvassing has been done among
the residents, and strong inducements have been of
fered them to favor the scheme. One or two meet
ings have been held to consider the issue, and to-night
another is to be held, at which time there will be sub
mitted for signatures a petition requesting the Super
visors to provide for a special election on the ques- I
tion.
It goes without saying if such an election be held j
the gamblers will carry it and the residents of the j
vicinity will be snowed under. A considerable num- j
her of men are already employed, and it will :
be an easy ta?k for the promoters of the gam
bling scheme to increase the number until it is suffi
cient to overcome the votes of the genuine residents
of the locality. The touts, the toughs and all the
gang that hangs round fake racing parks and pool
rooms will be very willing to assist the scheme for i
making a gambling hell out of Colma, and the elec
tion would be hardly more than a farce.
The Supervisors of San Mateo can hardly be ig
norant of the effects of the poolrooms in I
Sausalito and of the kind of racing that was j
carried on at Ingleside Park just before public indig- j
nation compelled its suppression. The gambling
was of the most pernicious kind, and its corrupting
influence affected all classes, the young as well is
adults, and women as well as men. To the evil '
effects of the track can be traced robberies, embez- |
zlements, forgeries, divorces, ruined homes, disgraced
families and suicides. So deadly was the curse and :
so far-reaching were its blighting effects that the
press almost without exception, pastors of churches
of all creeds, men of all panic?, united in the crusade
against it.
San Mateo will do well to profit by the experience
of San Francisco and Sausalito. That county is the
suburban home of many of our best people. Its lai ' \
are valuable and the community prosperous because it i
attracts to itself families of wealth and culture. If it
become a resort for gamblers and their following it
will lose its attractiveness to good citizens, and
Colma, which now may fairly expect to become one
of the most delightful centers of suburban life, will
sink to the condition of a resort of blacklegs and
other types of depraved humanity.
It is estimated by some ambitious statistician that
the United States paid $2 apiece for the Filipinos, ff
the estimate be correct Uncle Sam could announce
a bargain and discount sale and be assured of a sub
stantial profit.
IMPERIAL HEDGING.
THE Chronicle is positive that the form of gov
ernment provided for the Philippines will be
Territorial and not colonial. It has been ap
parent recently that the imperialists were beginning
to -hedge on that subject. Now the Chronicle says:
"We have no room in our political system for colo
nies and no inclination to make room."
The Territorial system is a declaration that all
these tropical acquisitions are intended for statehood
and their people for citizenship and a voice in the
politics and control of this country. As, all told,
they number 15,000,000, with 3,000.000 of voters, the
threat to make them citizens is as menacing to our
welfare as holding them as colonies is to theirs. We
would like to know the mind of our returned volun
teers as to making full American citizens of the Fili
pinos. As far as it has been expressed they are \
shown to be against it.
To run away from a colonial policy and into ulti
mate statehood is a mere exchange of the frying-pan
for the fire. If those tropical people are fit for ulti
mate citizenship in the United States they are fit for
ultimate independence, and should have it. We do
not need their help as citizens of this country. They
bring nothing into such a partnership that is of profit
or importance to us. As our race cannot thrive
where they do. the institutions we have created will
be exported and expected to flourish without our j
presence to watch and tend them.
The American people do not want fellow citizenship
with those tropical races, and, not wanting it, they !
know that the way to prevent it is to prevent the ;
first step toward it. That step is the proposed Ter- !
ritorial organization, which should be resisted by
every man who does not wish American citizenship !
to be cheapened, diluted and polluted.
The revolutionists of San Domingo have forced
themselves into the unique position of insisting that \
they shall be governed by nobody, not even them
selves.
THE MOST CURIOUS BOAT IN THE WORLD.
A NEWARK yachtsman has Invented a boat run by a windmill. It will make
- â  - right n; the face of the wind, and the harder the gale blows the
will go. Western New York sailors are exceeding in
terested in the paradoxical boat, an I wh< â  â  - 5 r it is put into the water
trial trip the crowd lines the wharf at Sodua Bay. where the little
craft is housed.
Tb*Â» boat was built as the result of an argument, which was followed by a bet.
Thoi a yachtsman of Newark, put up $100 to back his claim that John
ice commodore of the Sodus Bay Yacht Club, could not construct a
h would be able to make progress in the teeth of the wind. The bet was
â â¢ in the sprint:. Vice Commodore Sheffield began to think ail day long:.
Last Sunday he announced that he had constructed a bruit according to specifica
tions and was ready to try it In order that his point might be proved and his
money won.
The vice commodore put into the water a skiff like boat three feet lone. Di
rectly under the bow was a d.'ep keel. From the stern rose a lone vane, like
those seen on country barns to show the direction of the wind. Right above the
Low was a shaft with a windmill ten inches in diameter on the end.
The shaft inclined aft and ran through what would have been the sternpost
until it struck below the water line. A five-inch propeller was attached to this end
of It. It was such an absurd looking craft that everybody laughed when its builder
put the unwieldy thing into the water.
A strong west wind was blowing. The queer boat wavered for a second as It
sm:<-k the water, then slowly but steadily came to the wind. The windmill caught
the force of the gale and began to revolve. Little by little the boat forged ahead.
The harder the wind blew the more rapidly it gathered headway. The forward
keel and the after weather vane kept It dead in the wind.
The absurd little vessi Isl d out from the dock until its owner had to get in
a rowboat to capture it. Everybody cheered, and the wager was -declared won. It
is quite probable that Vice Commodore Sheffield will build a boat on the same
principle big enough to carry him and a friend or two. The little model has cre
ated no end of talk along the lake shore from Oswego to Rochester.
COMMENTS ON NEWS EVENTS BY THE PRESS
SPRECKELS' MAMMOTH SUGAR FACTORY.
San Francisco Outpost.
Claus Spreckels' mnmmoth sugar factory at Salinas began operations last
Thursday. This is the largest beet sugar factory in the world, and it marks a
â eh in the history of Salinas Valley. Some time ago the Outpost com
mented upon the id. al farming In the Salinas Valley made possible by the wealth
and enterprise of Claus Spreckels. With irrigation a beet crop is a certainty;
the price of beets is a certainty: the bf-et farmer cultivates a comparatively
small area and lives in a community: there la no isolation and dreary loneliness
for the families of these farmers. Mr. Spreckels has not endowed any colleges,
but he spends his wealth in California, in enterprises that add to the wealth of
the State and give remunerative employment directly and indirectly to thou
sands. He has made hundreds of happy homes and is a public benefactor.
CALIFORNIAS VOLUNTEERS.
Lake County Bee.
San Francisco did herself proud in the entertainment of the California volun
s who returned from Manila last Thursday. A fund of nearly JQO.OOO was
raised f"r the celebration, about half of which was spent in jollification; the
other half will be given to needy soldiers.
For three days tl\e city was so crowded that lodgings could not be had for
love or money. Hundreds of people, including women and children, had to spend
the night on the streets. It was one of the biggest affairs ever attempted on
this coast.
Th>- Call made a hip scoop by having a boat anchored ten miles outside the
Heads, from which a message was sent by wireless telegraphy as soon as the
Sherman was -;::1 ;â¢ .1. This enabled The Call to give out the news before it had

Dear Sir: Referring to the well-written

remarks concerning same in the kindliest

For thirty-four year*, under, I think,
twelve differeni administrations of vari

sacriflt Ing devotion to the best Interests
of the State and of the unfortunates com

The result has been that the institution
is the pride of the State; that ite reputa

cupies a fr'mt rank anvmg similar insti

In all these years scandal has not

These conditions continue up to this

prediction that interference by any board

DEWEYON THE PHILIPPINES.
From Life.
THE opinions of Admiral Dewey
about the war in the- Philippines,
as recently reported by the London
Daily News, anil up to the time of
this -writing not denied by the ad
miral, are of the highest interest and im
portance. The News correspondent asked
if the Philippines were likely to be paci
lied soon. lie says that the admiral re- !
plied:
"I have the question of the Philippines
more at heart than has any other Ameri
can, because I know the Filipinos inti
inauly, and they know I am their friend.
The recent insurrection is the fruit of the
anarchy which has so long reigned in the
islands, but the Insurgents will have to
submit themselves to the law, after being
accustomed to no law at all. i believe and
affirm, nevertheless, that the Philippine
question will be very shortly solved.
"The Filipinos are capable of governing 1
themselves: they have all qualifications
for it. It is a question of time, but the
only way to settlo the insurrection and
assure prosperity to the archipelago is
to concede self-government to the inhabi
tants. That would be a solution of many
questions, and would satisfy all. especi
ally the Filipinos, who believe themselves
worthy of it, and are so.
"I have never been in favor of violence
toward the Filipinos. The islands are at
this moment blockaded by a Meet, and
war reigns in the interior. This abnor- j
mal state of things should cease. I j
should like to see autonomy first conced- I
ed, and then annexation might be talked I
about. This is my opinion. I should like !
to see violence at once put a stop to. j
According to my view, the concession of ' .
self-government ought to be the most ! .
just and most logical solution."
If these are the admiral's opinions and j '
he has expressed them, they afford In j
themselves good reason for the hope that !
the Philippine question will soon be â  .
solved. They are the identical opinions ! â¢
that the extreme expansionists have ridi- 1
culed and berated.

There is- a nice little tempest in a tea
pot aboard the United States transport
Sheridan. ThVee officers of the South
Dakota Regiment are under arrest for
"conduct unbecoming an officer and a
gentleman," while the rank and rile of
both the South Dakotas and Minnesotas
are almost in a state of mutiny because
they were forced to scrub decks and do
the work of scullions during the voyage.
They made ineffectual kicks against doing
the work, but Colonel Frost put 110 men
on guard duty and compelled the soldiers
to clean up the ship. Almost from the
time the transport left Manila this guard
was on duty and when the vessel reached
port the men were almost ripe for an
outbreak.
The men under arrest are: Lieutenant
Colonel Lee Stover. Surgeon Major Warne
and Lieutenant Horace C. Bates. It ap

criticizing the conduct of their superiors.
Major Warae stigmatized Colonel Frost
as "a coward ana a cur" in a letter to

Colonel Frost is a graduate of the In
fantry and cavalry school at Fort Leav
enworth. Kans. He enlisted in the Twen
ty-third Infantry in the earl eighties,
and rose from the ranks to a first lieu
tenancy. He has been instructor in mili
tary' science and tactics In the South Da
kota Agricultural College, but was recent
. iy detailed as military secretary to Gov
ernor Lee of South Dakota. When war
was declared he went to Chickamauga
and rejoined his regiment, but the people
of South Dakota Bent a petition to the
Secretary of War and he whs allowed to
return and assume command of the South
Dakota Regiment.
Colonel Frost, on assuming command of
the volunteers at once organized the
strictest kind of military rule. His men
grumbled because they were not given the
. same liberties as other volunteers but it
| did them no good. On the firing line in
I the Philippines he worked his men very
< hard, and then when his officers took ; i
i dislike to him there was trouble all
: around.
. When the Sheridan was fitted out and
I the South Dakota and Minnesota regi
! mpnts aboard Colonel Frost assumed
i command as ranking officer. It was then
that the deck scrubbing and scullion bri
gade was formed and guard, a hun
red strong, had to be called out The
regulars who came up in the Sheridan are
of the opinion that both arrests and mi
i subordination are the result of politics
and that once the regiments get home the.
1 whole matter will be settled
In the case of the Mlnnesotas that regi
ment is also at outs with its colonel. The
men assert that he got '"cold feet" in the
Philippines and came home. He has been
in San Francisco about two months and
yesterday went out to visit his regiment
He received a very cold welcome. Many
of the officers of the regiment turned
their backs on him, and this action
brought the tears Into Mrs. Ames' eyes.
The sight of her tears moved the Minne
sota boys, and they gave three cheers for
their colonel. Some of the men of the
regiment are very stout defenders of Colo
nel Ames. They assert that he was not m
his right mind when he left Manila, and
has not even now fully recovered from his
campaign in the Philippines. Be that as
it may, all hands wi.i settle their differ
ences when they go into camp to-day.
There was one stowaway on the Sheri
dan who nearly ended his days in the ves
sel's hold. Yesterday he was taken in
charge by Mrs. Arthur Coddlngton of the
Red Cross Society and removed to St
Luke's Hospital, but it is feared by the
transport surgeon that his uavs are num
bered. The man's name Is Arthur Sawyer
and he went from the States to Manila to
make a fortune. He became stranded and
sick and, disgusted, stowed himself away
on the Sheridan. The soldiers kept him
alive during the trip, and yesterday he
tried to make hi? escape. The unfortunate
fellow was only able to totter to the gang
way, and there he fell in a heap more
dead than alive. He was picked up un
conscious and carried to a berth The
Red Cross people were notified, and Mr*
Coddington at once went out on the State
tug Governor Markham and brought him
ashore. He was still unconscious and in
a high fever when the Ambulance started
with him for St. Luke's.
The transport Columbia sailed for Man
ila last night, and the Sheridnn takes her
berth at b olsom-street wharf at 10 o'clock
this morning. The soldiers will be landed
after breakfast, and about 9 o'clock will
tart on tneir march to the Presidio

THE SA^ FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 9, 1899.
THREE MAJORS TO
EVERY REGIMENT
OF VOLUNTEERS
One Vexing Point Well
Settled.
The expected commissions for majors in
the First California Regiment were pre
] sented to the lucky men yesterday, and
j with them came the promotion right
j down the line. Captain O'Neil and Cap
tain Cunningham are the new majors,
but there Is a chance yet for Captain
Connolly, who lias been acting as major
j since last spring, and in his chance lies
an interesting question for the volunteers.
When Major Tilden was discharged and
j Major Sime was given a commission in
j the Eleventh Cavalry, Captain Cunning-
I ham and Captain Connolly were made the
acting majors. Captain O'Neil was the
' senior captain, but he declined the pr >-
motion. An attempt was made to pro
mote Major Boxton to be lieutenant colo
i nel and to appoint three majors, ,he orig
-1 inal complement of the regiment, but his'
â  was not allowed by trie authorities at Ma
; nila. It was declared that the regiment
: was governed by the old army bill, not
the reorganization measure, and there
, fore the lieutenant colonel would have to
command the Brst battalion and. two
i majors were oil the regiment would be al
lowed. As a consequence no promotions
: were made. The regiment got along with
no lieutenant colonel, Boxton as the only
! major, and Captain Cunningham "tiu
j Captain Connolly as acting majors.
' Yesterday the tide suddenly turn! and
I all on account of Principal Musician
I Julian Ait ken. It was found he held a
j position under the old law, which provid
ed for two principal musicians, and the
mustering officers declared they could not
muster him out as a principal musician.
Th.> reorganization bill allows but one
principal musician, and he would have to
ne reduced.
It looked bad for Aitken for a while.
but it was suggested that if the law
worked one way, it should also work an
! other, and if the reorganization bill pro
vided for but one principal musician, it
also provided for several band sergeants
â  and corporals, a quartermaster of the
rank of enptatn and a commissary officer
of \he ranK of first lieutenant, besides
three majors. And furtner, If the regiment
! could not be mustered out except under
â  the reorganization bill, it was entitled to
! all the reorganization bill allowed. Hence,
the third major, and the recommend
of Captain Connolly.
The recommendation of Connolly was
made out at â â â  "â  and was sent to the ad
jutant general of the Sum-. At the same
time there was forwarded an application
for the promotion of First Lieutenant
Otto Si '. â â¢â  rdtfegei . regimental quarter
master, to be captain, and the appoint
ment of Commissary Sergeant Clirrord to
!be first lieutenant md commissary. Ait
ken, the cause of it all, was not forgot
ten. He was reduced from principal mu
sician to private of the band, and was
â  then raised to v sergeant of the band.
: He is the regimental trumpeter.
There Is every Indication that the posi
tion taken by colonel Duboce will be up
held, as there v no doubt about the mus
tering out of the regiment under the re
organization bill, it is a matter that
should greatly interest the volunteer remi
ments to be mustered out and those just
formed. . .
The list of promotions announced to the
regiment yesterday wen as follows:
To bo maji rsâ Curtain Thomas F. â¢ Nell,

The First California Regiment is pre
pared to pay all honors to the bodies
of those of its comrades which came home
on the transport Sheridan. The bodies
of Captain Rhelnhold Rlchter, First Ser
geant M. Justh and John V. Dun more will
i,. burled in the National Cemetery at
the Presidio, 'ihat of Edwin A. O'Neil
will be burled in Holy Cross Cemetery.
There will be a suitable escort from the
regiment at the funeral of each, but as
the men of the First have given up their
arms there may not be a tiring squad. It
I Is possible that arms may be borrowed,
I but that is a matter for future arrange
! ment. The funerals of those to be buried
i in the National Cemetery will not take
I place before Tuesday next.
There was a delicate attention paid to
Lieutenant Frank Willard yesterday by
the men of his command, Battery D of
the California Artillery. He was called
before the battery yesterday afternoon
and was presented with a Â»aber as a
token of the esteem in which he is held
by hi? men. Lieutenant Wlllard is one
of the recent promotions from the ranks
made since the artillery battalion re
turned from Manila. lie was the first
sergeant of Battery D all through Its
service in the Philippines, and he earned
for himself the kindliest feelings of both
officers and men.
The Colorado men have been mustered
out and great it; their" rejoicing thereat.
They have served faithfully and there is
no regiment that brings home a military
record that can better theirs. They have
been soldiers when the time came and
they have been gentlemen whenever the
occasion required. There has been no
trouble with the men, they have had no
prisoners and no broaches of. discipline
or of law to report, and they leave the
service with a clean bill of military
health and leave a vacancy It will take
a good regiment to nil. Their command
j ing officer, Colonel McCoy, is a quiet, un-
I assuming man. trained in the National
Guard and willing to admit he is not a
soldier by profession, and to him is due
the credit for the enviable reputation the
regiment has made for itself. If another
war should come there will be at least one
good regiment to report from Colorado
The regiment was paid off yesterday
each man getting three months' pay and
as much of his clothing allowance as he
had left for himself, besides his travel
pay. amounting to between $50 and JGO a
man. In the morning before the first
man had been discharged Colonel McCoy
issued the following order:

ance; nor will it be settled until 'his
morning. It has been the custom for the
last in to dine tho latest comer, hut in
the case of the Minnesota men it was the
announced intention of the California men
to wade in op to the limit and return, if
possible, some of the courtesies the Min
nesota men showed them when they were
nearly as far away from home. The <"ill
fornia command has been rather demor
alized, however, by the brilliancy of the
reception which has been off. ted itself,
and it has left the men with minds some
what i oc fused and no time to spare; they
are allowed the fullest liberty from camp
and it is not easy to get them together
on the'ppur of the moment, and it looks
iif. if the courtesies to be extended to the
Minnesota men will have to be tendered
after they have become settled in camp.
That there will be something done Is as
sured, but men home have more excuses
for lapses of hospitality than those only
on the way.

1 T. H. Arnold of the Western Golfer, pub
lished at Chicago, has recently been vis
iting the links of Southern California. He
pronounced the new grounds of the Los
Angeles Country Club as equal to any In
the Western States. They are pretty and
of natural rolling land, admirably adapted
to the game, the excellent management
of the greens forcing members to play
genuine golf. The earth-bunkers are pre
ferred to the barbed-wire fences common
on Easteyn links. The putting-grounds of
sand instead of green turf are disappoint
ing at first, but once players get accus
tomed to them, they find them attractive.
The sand putting-ground requires steady
nerve and excellent judgment, on account
of the roll of the ball, and so demands
. expert^ pJay^^Mr.^ Arnold_thlnkÂ» tijat.
THE SA!N FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 9. 1899.
trtere is a lack of the genuine St. An
drew's golfing spirit here: the people play
good American golf, hut they have for
the most pur; been their own teachers,
and their play lacks the beauty and thor
oughness of the simon-pure St. Andrew's
golf.
TO PROTECT THE
TRUCKEE TROUT
Nevada Officials Will Co-operate
With the . Calif orn a Fish
Commission.
The officials of Nevada have at last
awakened to the importance of seconding
the efforts of the California State Fish
Commission in preserving, the trout in
1 Truckee River. This trout stream, pro
nounced the finest on the coast, is chiefly
in Nevada. In the past the tish have not
; been protected in that State and the ef
forts of the California officials on their
I side of the line have been nullified. Fish
and Game Commissioner Vogelsang made
' a special trip there a few days since and
! held several conferences with the Nevada
officials.
As a result they adopted resolutions i
reciting the necessity of protecting fish
in the close season, the building and main- â¢
: tenance of fish ladders and the prevention :
â of rnillmen dumping sawdust Into the
river. The resolution directs the District
Attorney, Sheriff and Constables to exert
every effort to protect the fish.
A "new fishladder has been erected re
i cently near Reno and three more a.re to
be added. One is in course of construction
near Verdi. The Fish Commissioners hope
1 to take spawn on the Truckee next spring
and will then stock it to its fullest ca
pacity.
The next meeting of the San Francisco
Fly Casting Club will be held at Jules on
Tuesday evening. Archie J. Treat will en
tertain the members with an illustrated
, lecture on the mountain lakes most fre
â  quented by the anglers. The musical por
tion of the programme is being prepared
by Charles F. Stone. President Walter
D. Mansfield leaves for Verdi, on the |
i Truckee River, to-day, and will endeavor ;
: to return with sufficient trout for the
dinner.
F. G. Sanborn and Frank McLennan
have returned from Pelican Bay, where
I they spent two weeks shooting and fish
| ing. They fished both the Williamson
and the Sprague rivers, as well as Pelican
Bay. The latter Is providing the best
i sport of the season, but not so sensational
!as last year. The snipe and duck shoot
i ing is remarkably good. On Monday they
i killed thirty-seven snipe on the marsh in
i front of the lodge. They, also secured
I good bags of canvasbacks and mallard.
: The season opened on the Ist inst.
I They spent one day in quest of deer, but
saw no signs of them.
The enthusiasts who went across the
bay or. Sunday to fish the estuary for
striped bass returned practically empty
! handed. Among the well-known rod
wielders were: Turner, Brotherton. "Doc"
"Watt Christlanson, Wilson and Babcock.
The net result for the day was three or
four small fish.
F. H. Reed fished the Truckee River
i near Boca last Saturday and Sunday and
had good sport.
John Butler, John Salmi and John Lem
-1 mer leave on -Monday for their annual
pilgrimage to Eel River for the steelhead
: fishing. They are the advance guard of a
I large number of fishermen who will go
, north for the splendid sport offered there.
1 John Gallagher went up some days since
and his first essay on the river netted him
two large steelheads and seventeen small
i ones. The fishing is pronounced remark
able for so early in the season.
Colonel Kelihor and C. G. Young are i
still at Boca, where they have been for !
three weeks.
â¢ J. "W. Orear of Oakland goes to "Webber
Lake and Meadow Lake to-day for the
fishing and grouse-shooting.
A party of 100 fishermen went to the
Farallones on the steamer Point Arena j
last Saturday. W. R. Borlinl caught the
prize fish, a thirty-two-pound cod. Dr.
ieberst and S. V. Costello were also sue-'
I cessful, if what they say is true.

STRIVING FOR BLUE RIBBONS.
The Becond annual horse show of the
Burllngame Country <'lul> was opened <>n
the club grounds yesterday. It will be
concluded to-day, when a large attendance
iis expected, the entire affair being thrown
open to the public. An immense amphi
theater has been prepared Immediately in
I front of the clubhouse, from which the
competition is watched by the members
| and their guests.
SCULLERS MEET
IN CONVENTION
Will Discuss the Government of
Boat Racing on This Coast.
Around the Clubs.
A notice has bi-en sent by the secretary
of the Pacific Coast Amateur Athletic
Union to the representatives of the vart
j ous clubs included In the association, in
forming them that the annual convention
of the association will be held on Monday
evening, the 18th inst., in the parlors of
the Olympic Club. Delegates are request
ed to bring with them proper credentials
certifying to their appointment as repre
sentatives. The following amendment to
the constitution, which was approved by
the board of managers on April 14, will
be presented for final adoption or rejec
tion:
The association shall have Jurisdiction
over the following athletic sports: Basket
ball, billiards, boxing, baseball Undoor and
outdoor), gymnastics. handball, hunlle
racing, jumping, lacrosse, footliall, pole
vaulting, wrestling, running, swimming,
rowing, tugs-of-war, walking, putting the
shot, throwing the discus, hammer and
Wrights.
The important point in the proposed
amendment is the inclusion of rowing in
the list of sports to be controlled by the
Pacific Association, though the Amateur
Athletic Union, of which the association
is a member, exercises no jurisdiction over
oarsmen, leaving their affairs to the Na
tional Association of Amateur Oarsmen.
There Is, however, little doubt that the
amendment will pass, the matter having
been thoroughly thrashed out some
months ago.
Last Sunday there was a large attend
ance of members at the South End boat
house, and several went out in skiffs or
barges. For the present the recently com
pleted handball court is attracting much
attention. The "Irish" barge crew is ex
pected to return from Manila by the next
transport. The Acme Club has promised
to pay $10 per month to the South Ends
as compensation for the loss of the barge
Qarfleld, which was burned In 1895 while
in the keeping of the Acme Club. A new
junior barge crew has been formed. It is
mado up of two skiffmen, a handball
player and an oarsman â J. Foley and Dr.
C. C. Dennis, Al Hampton and Emii
Blumlein. They are all hard workers,
however, and will give the junior crews
of thp other dubs a hard rub. -- â¢.â
Leashmen to Course for $3000
Thirty- Foot Yachts to Compete
Swift Carrier Pigeons to Race
The Mameda Boat Club intends within
the oominfc three weeks to give a regatta
on the estuary. There will be a barge
relay race in which a packet will he car
ried, a pie-eating contest in yawls, ana
short dashes of an eighth, a quarter and a
half mile in outrigged skiffs.
QUAIL ARE SAID
TO BE PLENTIFUL
Promise Good Sport for the Gun-
men in the Field When
the Season Opens.
With Ihp waning of the deer and the
dove season the sportsmen are preparing
against the rapidly approaching- day when
they will divide their attention between
Hiiail and ducks on marsh and upland.
In Elumboldt County mountain quail are
in abundance, while no valley quail are in
sij. r ht. The opposite is the case down
Salinas way, where valley quail are nu
merous. The sason will be hue in
Fresno County as no shooting is allowed
until November 1. The sport will be ai
its best throughout tho State at that date,
as a month earlipr there is a lingering
touch of summer in the atmosphere that
is :it;aii!St a man exerting himself in the
field.
The Empire Gun Club will promote one
of the most ambitious shoots at blue
rocks to-day and to-morrow ever held on
this coast. The meeting will be held on
the club grounds, Alameda Point, and
will be made a festive occasion. There
will be a merchandise shoot each day,
the gunmen being divided into twelve
classes, according to their merit. It must
be an inexperienced man who cannot win
something out of the hundreds of prizes

Juanlta, Thetis and Catherine. The Cyg
nus and Thetis raced home to Sausalito.

but towing three boats, while the latter
towed a skift and carried a canoe on
board. The Thetis passed the Cygnus.
but the moorings of both boats were
picked up almost simultaneously.
l^ast night Commodore Hill, followed by
three or four of the San Francisco fleet,
which has no entries in to-day's regatta,
started for Vallejo, where he anchored
for the night. To-day the yachts will sail
up N'apa Creek to Napa City, and will
anchor close to the bridge. To-night the

rp HE third renewal of the California
Produce stake will be run at Union
Produce stake will be run at Union
I Coursing Park to-day and to-morrow.
â *â  This is on*, of the richest stakes of
the year, the iotal prize money being
11350. A commbtep made up of men rep
resented in the stake decided to withhold
$450 of this amount for a consolation
stake to be run one week from to-mor
row.
The value of the prizes at Union Park
has spurred the Ingleside management on
to great efforts with the result that $1005
Is offered at that park to-day, making a
total of $3105 for which the dogs will run.
The most attractive feature of the
card is the Champion stake. In this are
such popular flyers as Connemara, Luxor,
Cavalier. Soubrette, Thornhill. Wild
Tralee, Kid McCoy, Jessamy, lwin City
Girl, Flyaway and Lawrence. In addi
tion to the big stake there is one for
non-winners, dogs that have not finished
better than third at either park during
the past six months. '
In addition to the Produce stake at
Union Park there will be an open stake,
for which $750 is offered in prizes. This
of itself would prove a good card under
ordinary conditions. When taken in con
junction with the big stake it makes a
marvelous programme. The dogs were
placed well in the draw, thus insuring
good sport throughout the various rounds
of the stake. Both stakes have a partic
ularly open look, it being a brave man
who "would attempt to pick the ultimate
winner. The Produce stake will attract
the attention of breeders the world over,
curiosity being excited as to what blood
lines will produce the greatest grey
hounds.
"Tom" Fitz of Merced will be a factor
in the local coursing from this time forth.
He has Thomas Mclnerney's great dogs
Johnny R. Rosie R, Norah, Regina and
Tommy Rex in his string. Some of these
have many stakes to their credit.
Three of D. J. Healey's dogs became
engaged in a fight while being exercised
recently. As a result Day Spring was
killed and Grenada sustained a broken
leg. The other nine dogs of the string
dragged their trainer along in an effort
to get into the tight.
Miller's Robbie has whelped seven pup
pies to For Freedom. The For Freedom-
Sly Girl youngsters are doing well. One
ot these will be the first of the great
English dogs progeny to run. It will be
run as a sapling, the others being saved
until they have attained their full growth
as they are too valuable to risk injury
to them. J
The annual plains meeting of the Inter
state Coursing Club will b< held at Mer
ced early in November.

Exciting Tennis Matches at Del Monte
Close Finishes at Sacramento
Big Pacers Coming to California
EASTERN MEN
GAIN TENNIS
CHAMPIONSHIP
Braley and Bell, Southern Califor
nia Players, Create Surprise
by Excellent Showing.
Prwla! Dispatch to ThÂ» Call.
DEL MONTE., Cal., Sept. B.â Whitman
and Wright are the winners of the Pacific
Coast all-comers' doubles tournament,
i and as such will play the Hardy brothers
to-morrow afternoon for the champion
ship of the Pacific Coast. â *"â¢
The Easterners engaged in two matches
to-day, in the morning: with .Braley and
Bell, champions of Southern California,
and in the afternoon with the Whitney
freres, winning both without much exten
sion or effort, although Braley and Bell
gave tin- Easterners the hardest battle
of the tournament. The first-class dou
bles teams of California are no longer
summed up in the names of Hardy and
Whitney; Braley and Bell Is the latest
addition, and it is a strong one.
Wherever you go on the Del Monte
grounds you strike some sort of a tennis
champion, even if it is of a village school.
There never was such a collection of
racket celebrities before. The day after
to-morrow it will be all over, and these
would-be champions will have lost the
denominations which carried them to Del
Monte to light with the men of the East.
The surprise of the day was the splen
did showing that Braley and Bell made.
This team came all the way from L,os
Angeles to wear out rubber soles on hard
asphalt in a vain light against Whitman
and Wright, but their work was easily
the best of the tournament. It was cer
tainly of a superior order when compared
with the playing of the doubles champions
of America, Ward and Davis. The first
sel played was won easily by the southern
team. Whitman and Wright secured but
three games.
The three sets following were won by
Whitman and Wright. 6â3. 6âl, Gâ 4. The
last set was not an easy one for them,
every point being contested and hard
fought. '- V
In the afternoon the largest crowd that
has yet gathered at the tournament filled
the stands and awaited the coining of the
four who were to play off the finals.
Whitman and Wright were first on the
scene of the racket struggle. George
Whitney was an Immediate follower, but
"Brother Bob" was late by some ten
minutes. The "clouting" he has received
during the last few days has left him
spiritless and he now thinks of taking
up golf or possibly croquet.
The first match of this contest was won
by Whitney and Whitney. "Brother Bob"
smiled and George pattered to the other
side of the net, happier than he has been
In four da vs. With a swish and bang
the terribles began their "clouting" again
and the Whitney treres were triturated
on the asphalt. Robert Whitney, with a
diabolic inspiration, thought it wise to
drive everything that came within his
rise. He wanted to be a "clouter." but
all that was accomplished by his swish
banging was a rent or two in the net and
removed sections of w<ie fence. Robert
X Whitney is now known as "Clouter 1-4
Socond." George Whitney played a steady
game, the best he has done since .the be
ginning of the tournament.
In the second set the Whitney? started
out well, winning the first two games.
The third game was taken by Whitman
and Wright, and they tied the score at
the end of the sixth game. Four gam'-s
were won by the local men in this set.
"Clouter the Second" had sided and
was feeling the ball. The third sot was
easy labor for the Easterners, the Whit
â  .'â¢-.> taking but a single game to con
sole them li v.< â  contemplation of the
many ''clouts" received at the hands of
the visitors. The tournament ended with
a quadruplicate handshake Just as Pro
fessor Joseph Dailey announced the win
ners.
The ladies' championship singles tour
nament was to be played to-morrow
morning, but the only lady players on
th.> theater of action are Miss Bee Hooper
and Miss Button of Southern California.
\ handsome silver toilet set ornaments
the office hall at the hotel and will be an
easily won reward if the tournament is
played, as Miss Jones, the present cham
pion, Is in the far East.
To-morrow afternoon the Hardys will
meet Whitman and Wright for the cham
pionship of the Pacific Coast. There are
many tennis omniscients at Del Monte
who "are willing to wager cigarettes that
it will be a fizzle match.
The scores of to-day's play:
Braley an.l Bell beat Fatjo and Warburton.

gala affair of the week. In the forenoon
at the park two nines, composed of
knights Of the grip, engaged in a game
of ' baseball, in which the Sacramento
team carried away the honors before an
audience composed largely of the fair
sex.
This afternoon they held a levee in the
betting ring and there got away with the
coin. The weather was sweltering hot,
which the harness brigade seemed to en
joy. Bee Bee and Panamint were the
only winning choices.
The Sunny Slope stake for two-year-old
fillies fell to the favorite Bee Bee, ridden
by Thorpe. A field of but /five young
misses went into the hands of the starter,
with Mldity a strongly backed second
choice. Thorpe, on the first choice, man
aged to get a running start, while the sec

standing flat-footed as the rubber snapped.
Bee Bee, never headed, won by over two
lengths In 1:02. Mldlty ran through her
field, easily securing the place from Flush

FANS LOOK FOR
GREAT BALL IN
TO-DAY'S GAME
Gilt Edoes and San Franciscos to
0
Cross Bats.
Local Nine Vow to Shake Off the
Hoodco Which Hoy rs Over
Their Heads.
With seven straight defeats charged up
against them the ball tossers of the home
club will enter the coming series with a
firm resolve to shake off the hoodoo. The
team has undoubtedly encountered much
hard luck, but Manager Harris concedes
that superior playing was responsible for
a few of the Sacramento victories, and in
deference to the demands of the fans he
has endeavored to strengthen his aggre
gation. Inability to connect with the ball
has been largely responsible for the com
paratively poor showing of the team and
Harris has sought to remedy that defect,
and he surely has made an improvement
in substituting Brockhoff for O'Neil and
Courtney for Muller.
Two good hitters having taken the
places of two weak ones the effect ought
to be felt in the coming series. Besides
that, there has been a complete reorgan
ization of the team and Captain Sullivan
expects to get better team work out of
the men. The series will no doubt attract
another large crowd of "fans" and en
thusiasts, for it is now well known that
when Sacramento and San Francisco
meet on the diamond the contests are
bound to be productive of exciting epi
sodes and close scores. The Sacramento
aggregation has a good lead, but if the
Friscoes win a majority of the series they
will be within easy winning distance. The
line-up for to-day's game follows:
Sacramento. Positions. San Francisco.

GWEN ZEIGLER
DEFEATS HIS
OLD OPPONENT
Special Digpatfh to The Call.
NKW YORK, Sept. S.â Owen Zeigler,
formerly of Philadelphia, but now of
Bath Eeach, N. V. . turned what
to be an inevitable defeat ir.to a vict< ry
to-night before the Broadway Athletic
Club, where he met and whipped hi* old
time opponent. Charles Burns, of Cincin
nati. The men had previously fought
twenty rounds to a draw. They met at
catch weights. Burns hud at least tesi
pounds advantage in weight and was very
Btrong arid aggressive.
In the opening- rounds Burns was tho
aggressor, and in the fourth round Zcig
ler '.vent down twice, in the following
round Zeigler looked worried and both
men seemed tired. Science was cast to
the wind completely and they simply
slugged each other. In the seventh both
fell in a clinch. Burns after hitting Zeig
ler rather low in the body, extended his
right hand as if to apologize, but Zeig
ler merely hit his opponent on the law.
This er raged Burns and in a wild dash
he threw Zeigler heavily on the ropes.
Burns then sent his left to the jaw arm
Zeigler fell through the ropes into the
arms ot his Beconds, who shoved him
back into the ring at the clang of the
bell. In the eighth Zeigler received a l"t
of punishment in the face, Burns forcing
him all over the ring. Burns kept forcing
in the tenth and had Zeizler on the ropes
toward the end of the round, in a very
weak condition.
To the surprise of everybody, Burns
particularly. Zeigler In the next round
sent a succession of right smashes to
the Western man's head and face. Burns
showed signs uf weariness and became de
cidedly groggy. A swing of Zeigler puc
Burns down on his back, and he remained
there for nine seconds, and the bell saved
him from a knockout.
Coming lip for the twelfth round Burns
was almost as good as whipped, an<s Z<m^
ler rushed him. shooting rights and left .
forcing a terrilic pace. A left to the chin
from Zeigler was follow, ,1 hy a right un
der the heart arid Burns tumbled to the
floor. Mf was SO nearly knocked out that

Kansas and Texas preferred and Norfolk pre

movement to cover short contracts when au

i Bradstrcct's Financial Review.
Â« _ . *
NEW YORK. Sept. B.â Bradstreet's Financial
Review to-morrow will say: While by no
means a broad market, the speculation of the
past week has been of a very intfrestine: de-
BCriptl in. It was. as has been the case for
rel weeks, largely of a professional kind,
thouch the erratic performances of some of
the stocks, which have been subjected to
manipulation by bull pools, attracted a certaia
measure of public buying. Toward the end of
the week the market, in tact, has assumed an
rght appearance, and Inclined to give
way under the pressure Induced by a stiffening
In the rates for money and the more threaten
ing aspect in the Transvaal question abroad. In
tion it may be noted that
while London has increased its speculative
h ildings on American securities, there are not
believed t 1 be any very large amounts of such
holdings t 1 be thrown on our market in case of
ii 'ute trouble.
It Is held that the foreiKii markets have been
warned so lons ahead that should war super
. â  â¢ the London m iney market or
on prices there would be Blight. In spite, how
ever, of the situation bavins thus bt-en par
tially die unted, II has created nervousness
In International banking circles, and was re
ulative market here by an
sed unwillinsness to take any decided
position. The advance in the rate for call
money I :â â  â â¢ i â¢â¢: ceni seems to be the natural
: rptlon of money in
Ivity. Last Saturday's bank state
hecause it
showed a smaller decrease In the surplus re
serves thfin had been anticipated. The belief
Is however, that the banks have been steady
losers In cash this week, both to the treasury
and the Interior, and that to-day's bank state
ment may be a positively bad one. The rise in
call loan rates was accordingly a factor In pro
ducing the mod, -rate concessions that the list
generally exhibited the last two .lays. Not a
link- confidence was shown in the temper and
n. y of speculation, based on the fact thai
the crops are now safe and that general busi
ness Is In such a favorable and profitable con
dition. Above all. the "boom" in the iron In
dustry and the large profits which concerns
engaged In it are now ma.lune has stimulated
â  tive movement in securities ol that

Btadstrect's on Trade.
NEW YORK, Sept. 8.- -Bradstreefa to-mor
row will say: Strength of staple prices, activity
i,. fall demand, large railroad earnings, re
ports of heavy lake traffic and of activity in
leading industries are the features, none of
them necessarily new. but still presenting
themselves In the trade situation this week.
Expansion in fall demand is perhaps most
notable at the leading Western and North
western markets, but advices from Eastern
markets furnish evidence that active inter
est is manifested at those centers. The price
situation is one of notable strength, the events
1 of. the week. in fact, having been to accen
tuate in many cases the advances shown dur
ing August. Cereals are generally higher and
' trading has been within rather narrow limits.
! the advance in wheat having been mainly due
to short coverings, induced by more bullish
' foreign cables and Increased export demand.
The hot weather In the West is responsible
for a further shading in exuberant estimates
of the corn crop and of the slight strengthen
ing in prices shown therein. The only changes
' in the iron and steel situation are in an up
i ward direction as to prices. Complaints of
behind hand supplies and scarcity of ma- j
terlal are still made. Work has in many in
stances notably In ship-building, been de- |
layed by backward deliveries of steel. Borne i
Improvement in the position of anthracite coal !
is reported and prices obtained at the East are i
claimed to be nearer the scale, while recent |
advances at the West are maintained. The
I production tor August was fully 12 per rent
I larger than In the same month a year ago
C.ood demand has evidently had the effect of
strengthening raw wool prices, which are firm j
I as a whole and slightly higher for the finer I
grades Crop damage reports have been again !
I the Important feature in cotton this week and
! prices are higher as a result In face of very
heavy receipts at most Southern points,
claimed to be due, however, to premature
ripening In some cases. Further strength is
! to Iâ¢â  noted In dairy products this week. Early
â  dry weather conditions still affect butter
' prices, while good foreign and home demand
has strengthened quotations in cheese. A con
i scpicuous exception to the strength displayed
i by most staples, however. Is found in coffee,
i which this week reached the lowest price ever
recorded, thus reflecting enormous stocks <~ 1
Brazilian grades and a possible heavy crop the j
current season. Wheat, including flour, ship- |
1 ments for the week aggregate 4.353,906 bushels,
against 3.618.444 bushels last â  week, 3,200,208
bushels in the corresponding week of 189S,
5 461 08 bushels In 1897, 3,759,14 l bushels in \\:Â«\
and 1.810,039 bushels in LS9S.
Since July 1, this season, the exports of
wheat aggregate 37,476.246 bushels, against 32,
--793,800 bushels last year and 34,312,752 bushels
In 1897 98.
Business failures for the week number only
123 against 131 last week. 142 in this week a
year ago, 173 in 1897, 308 In ISSG and 213 in
1895.
Business failures in the Dominion of Canada

Dun's Review of Trade.
Â« _ â Â»
NEW YORK, Sept. 7.â R. G. Dun & Co.s
weekly review of trade will say to-morrow:
The sky Is still cloudless and no disquiet-
Ing change has come during the week. In
spite of more warlike news about South Africa,
, the Bank Of England behaves as If the worst
possibly had been fully provided for. and this
country has no reason to fear trouble from
! that source unless English markets have so
â  ' overloaded as to need help. The marketing of,
I I domestic products, both form and manufac
tured, continues surprisingly large for the
season. The new possessions, taken together,
are returning In revenue already more than It
cost to .lean and govern them. The West
anil South still behave as if it would be im
pertinent for New York to offer money for
crop moving, and are still bidding for com
' mercial loans here. Failures are few, strikes
scarce and readily settled and the passage of
September 4 without pressure means reason
able safety for months ahead.
Cotton lias risen 3-16 c since annual reports,
regardless of these and owing to bad accounts
from Texas. The market for goods Is re
markably strong this Week and previous prices
are fully maintained.
After a sharp decline wheat has risen Vie
this week, with Atlantic exports 2,900,906 j
bushels. flour included. asainpt 2,326,100
bushels last year and Pacific exports 364 i 2J6
bushels, against 163.192 bushels last ynr.
Torn has also taken a start upward, rising
He, with exports of 3,051.669 bushels, against
2,431,085 bushels last year. So great demand
for both grains deserves notice, but so do
Western receipts, 5.495.697 bushels wheat,
apainst 6. 774. '11 l bushels last year, and of corn
5, '.<23. 447 bushels, against â¢4.2W,4",2 bushels last
year. There is no hesitancy in selling or in
shipping; with extraordinary foreign de
mands for the season farmers are sending for
ward at remarkable low prices extraordinary
quantities of grain.
Neither philosophical explanations of the rise
in iron anl steel, nor constant addition to the
numher of furnace** producing, checks the ad
vance, which has made Bessemer pig sell for
$2r; at Plttsburg, cray forge for $19 7f> there.
anthracite No. 1 for $3 00 at Phlledalphia and
local coke for 12160 at Chicago. With the
whole output of its furnaces sold ahead for
the year the valley association demand $23 6.'.
at Pittaburg on future contracts and Chicago
is selling mainly for delivery next year. Fin
ished products are advanced in some cases $5
per ton at a time without chocking the de
mand, as for sheets at Pittsburg. with plates
advanced $2 md wire nails $3 per ton.
Large enntracts even at these prices are re
ported, many running into next year, in Chi
cago and Pittsburg in bars, and in plates at
all points, with 3000 tons Western and lari;^
Eastern hrldgo contracts taken by works f"ur
to five months behind already and inquiry for
twenty-two mil"s of pipe in South Africa
pending.
Tin is str.-ing at 32Vic for spot, with 1256 tons
decrease in all visible supply. L,nke copper Is
ptf-ady at 18', 2 0, with heavy buying for elec
trical use. and lead is i,uiet at $Â» fiO.
Preparations for other woolen combinations
affect the market for goods somewhat, which is
nevertheless Btrong, although some irregularl
tiÂ»s have developed in worsteds. The wool
market is much less active than of late, with
sal^s of only 9.225.200 pounds at the chief mar
kets, mostly Territory, and while prices are
still stlfT manufacturers are buying only for
immediate needs.
Quotations for the week are unchanged, but
holders are confidently looking for a large ad
vance to result from the London sales.
Failures for the first week in September have
been $715,560, against 51. 111. 593 last year: manu
facturing *212.r,\ against $224,Gf12 last year, and
trading $4Â«6,313, apalnst $7<J3.P91 last year.
Failures for the week have been 132 In the
United States, against 164 last year, and 30 in
Canada, against 16 last year.

Chicago Grain Market.
! CHirwOO, Sept. R.-Heavy receipt? in the
I Northwest nitd Indifference of foreign buyers
I were influences nt the cpening in wheat which
caused an initial decline of 'iffSc and which
! resulted in a heavy market throughout the en
| tire session. Early Liverpool cables showed
about '/id decline and reported a very slack
cash demand there. Heavy receipts at Russian
P<>rtr were also reported and Argentine ship
ments were liberal. The fact that the Trann-
I vaal situation did not improve the foreign de-
I mand apiiarently brought traders back to the
old basis of supply and demand and the con
tinued large receipts at primary points and the
small cash demand here resulted in more or less
liquidation by longs in all the deterred futures.
September, however, was in good demand from
elevator people. At times there was brisk com
petition from that source, and prices were
steadily maintained. Shortly before noon a
more rosy aspect was given the gjtuation by re
ports of good engagements at New York ana
. d.v the more serious tone of Transvaal advices.
This resulted in a contraction of the selling
movement and induced some covering by shorts,
a slight rally in prices resulting, but by noon
the market had fallen back Into its old rut anil
the slight advantage was soon lost. The real
feature of trading was its extreme narrowness.
: Prices all day kept within half a cent range, |
: and trading was almost entirely professional.
i The market for quite long periods- was abso- j
: lutely at a standstill. Heaviness prevailed to
I the end. During the latter part of the session
about the only support the market received was
buying against puts, which were touched early
in the day. December opened %@%c lower at
Tl'.j'an-'Nio. declined to 71<g71 l ( c. reacted to 71%e
I and declined again to 71&@71%c, where it
closed; September closed unchanged at 70% c.
I Corn was weak and lower. The breaking 01
( the drought throughout the corn belt and cooler
weather helped the bears and brought consid
i erable long corn Into the market. December
closed %c lower.
! Oats acted independent of other grain mar
; kets. Some easiness was shown, but deferred
i futures were steady and in good demand. De
! cember closed a shade lower and September
lost %c.
Provisions were slow and weak. There was
steadiness early on the firm hug market and on
the continued cash demand, but later In the
session there was quite general realizing, and |
prices declined. October pork declined 15c, lard
7%c and ribs 6@7%c.

Family Retail Market.
The tendency in Butter and Eggs in the
wholesale markets is toward lower prices, but
the retail quotations remain about the same.
Supplies of both have been rather larger of
late.
The Poultry market is kept well supplied by
the continued large arrivals from the East, an.l
prices accordingly keep low. Grouse and Moun
tain Quail are now in market, but they are be
yond the reach of the ordinary purse.
Fruits have passed their zenith for this sea
son, and Peaches, Plums and Bartlett Pears
are now in lighter supply. Grapes are the
leading fruit at the moment, and are in their
usual abundance.
There are still large quantities of Vegetables
on the market at the usual low prices. Toma
toes and Green Corn have been particularly
plentiful of late.
Salmon goes out of season to-day.

ALASKAN COAST
ON THE WARPATH
Schooner Kate and
Anna Attacked.
REPULSED BY THE CREW
â¦
GOOD. HARD FIGHTING FOR
HALF AN HOUR.
Hnd It Not Been for the Captain' 3
Presence of Mind Everybody
Aboard Would Have
Been Killed.
The well-known sealing schooner Kate
and Anna', which made a $10,000 catch in
the Santa Barbara Channel during the
early part of the season, reached port :
yesterday afternoon after a most excit
ing: cruise along the coast of Alaska. The
weather was so bad that there was only
q few days during the entire voyage that
a boat could be lowered. In consequence,
not a seal was taken and only one sea
otter was killed.
Near Icy Cape a band of Indians with
their war paint on attacked the schooner.
Tlfey were in their canoes and "armed |
to the teeth." The sails and topsails of
the Kate and Anna bear witness to the I
fusillade that the natives poured into her, :
and had it not been for the presence of
mind of Captain Anderson there might j
now be another sealing schooner "posted
as missing."
"We have had hard luck ever since we
left port on this cruise," said Captain
Anderson yesterday. "After doing so
well '.n the early part of the season we
all made sure that Dame Fortune was '
our friend, but the jade turned us down, j
We had the worst kind of luck. For
weeks at a time we never saw a seal
and when we did get a glimpse of them j
it was too rough to lower a boat.
'â¢Finally I gave it up in despair and
decided to run for San Francisco We
v ere then off Kodiak, on the mainland, '
ana I started down the coast, Just be- !
fore reaching Icy Cape the vessel was
becalmed, and that night I noticed a fire
burning on the beach. The next lay a
canoe with three Indians in it came "out
from the shore and boarded the schooner
They belonged to the Yakutat tribe and I
had their war paint on, lighting feathers i
in their hair and were armed to the |
teeth. Tho leader had a gun over his
shoulder, a pistol in his belt and another ;
in his hip pocket.
"I asked them what they wanted and
their leader asked me what I was doing j
there. He talked fairly good tinglis and
gave me to understand that he meant
business I told him that we were not
doing anything; but that we were on our
way to San Francisco, and were omy
awaiting a breeze to carry us homeward.
Then he wanted to know if we were otter ;
hunting, and again I told him we were
r.ot.
"The three Indians kept looking over
their shoulders toward the shore while
they were talking and I soon saw their
reason for so doing. Nine canoes were
being launched and each canoe contained
three armed Indians. There were four
teen of us all told on the schooner and
] signaled the hunters to get their rifles.
Had the Indians on the deck of the
schooner not waited for their companions
to embark, but ordered our hands up |
they would have had us at their mercy. I
As it was the hunters got their guns and j
I then ordered the Indians into their I
canoe. They at first refused, saying their !
companions, who were then racing toward i
us, had a present for me. The sight of !
a leveled Winchester made them enter thÂ» '
canoe and at that moment the prayed-for I
breeze came along. It was very light, !
but it carried the vessel through the
[â water at a fair speed. |
"By this time the entire crew was j
armed and I had just time to order them ;
to lie down behind the bulwarks when j
the Indians in the canoes let fly a volley |
at us. Some, of the shots went through I
the sails, many of them lodged in the j
hull and one of them went through tho j
rook's galley and spoiled our only coffee
l>ot. We gave them a volley in return i
;Â»nd maybe there wasn't a scattering !
among that ftotilla. They were brave
though and at once returned to the at
tack and there was a fusillade there for ]
a time that would have passed for a
Filipino night attack. We tired over 200
rounds of ammunition and I don't know |
how many shots the Indians sent after I
us, but I'm certain there are a few
pounds of lead in the hull of the Kate
and Anna.
"The breeze began to freshen and
â¢"nallv we drew away from the canoes I
and 'the firing ceased. I don't know :
whether we killed any of the Indians or j
r.ot. I don't think we did. Anyhow it j
was a case of our lives or theirs.
There are several hunters on the Kate
and Anna who are credited with being
able to put a bullet into a seal's eye at â¢
one hundred yards. It therefore seems
more than probable that some of thos*
Indians were at least hit. However, no
tody aboard the schooner will admit that
he lied an Indian, so the matter rests
there The run down the coast was un
eventful after that and the Kate and
.Anna will now lie up for the winter.
Captain Anderson reports the other â â¢
eels of the fleet with the following catch
of sea otter: Rattler, 6: Pearl, 13; Hun- ;
ter. 10; Olga, 8; Lydia, 3; Lettitia and St.
Paul, clean.
ORGANIZED LABOR DOINGS.
Oakland Hod-Carriers Strike Because
Non-Union Lathers Are Em
ployed.
Reports from various labor organiza
tions were received by the Building
Trades Council at Its meeting Thursday
the principal Hem of Importance being a
btrike in Oakland by the hodcarrlers, this
union having declined to carry material
on buildings where non-union lathers were
at work. A complaint was also received
from Business Agent Harry M. Saunders
of the Building Trades Council regard
ing Contractors Campbell & Pettus, who
have the Government work on Goat Isl
and and who have advertised broadcast
all over the State for bricklayers and
metal roofers. In the advertisement sent
out the wages were stated to be $3 DO for
bricklayers. whereas the men who
came to work only received S3, and out
of this U a week was deducted for board.
"With the metal roofers, who were sup
posed to set $3 a day, only â *- 50 was paid
with the same deduction for board.
By pursuing this line of deceit, the
Building Trades Council claim, the city
Is being flooded with non-union mechan
ics, . ho have been brought here by false
representations of the contractors.
<*Â.. business of less importance was
disposed of by the council, among which
was the report that the delegates from
the marblecutters would be seated at
the next meeting. The paperhangers re
quested the aid of the organizing commit
tee to assist it in reorganizing : their union.
A letter of condolence was ordered sent
to the relatives of A. 11. Gibons of the
Painters' Union; who was killed yester
day at. Clay and Walnut streets. The
Painters' Union reported that the new
suale of wages was being accepted
throughout the city.
At a meeting of the Labor Com last
night a communication was received from
Secretary W. M. i" â â  _â â  of the Building
Trades Council calling the attention of
the Labor Council to the fact thai, the
electric work on the Belgian King, a
transport, was being done by "scab"
workmen;
Quite a discussion â¢â¢â¢.a* had regarding the
hours of labor which men are compelled
to observe in the Union Iron Work!',
but nothing definite was done. The Na
tive Sons came In for a gentle roast for.
their attitude in engaging non-union mu
sicians for their parade last night. The
day which the natives love to celebrate
was sarcastically termed "scab day, fol
lowing on Labor day." '. Â
The Council declined to amend its con
stitution in regard to delegated who re
ceive nominations- from political parties
holding delegates' seats In the Council.

He Is Alarmed at the Prospect of Not

Auditor Wells expressed himself yester

having money to run the city government
in the Immediate future, and is :â 
that the tax levy, as already fixed by the

EXTRA CLERKS.
Auditor Wells Will Employ Them to
Compute Taxes.
Auditor Wells will employ one hundred
additional clerks, commencing from the
19th of this month, to compute the taxes
i of the last fiscal year on the assessment
1 roll. Several weeks ago Mr. Wells pre
pared a list of clerks whom he desired to
â  employ. Before they were appointed, how
ever, they had to pass an examination in
; arithmetic and penmanship, and in this
! way only competent people have been em
ployed.
Seventy-five members of the force will
be men and the rest women. They will
be given three weeks' employment at $4 33
a day. The assessment roll fund will
probably be sufficient for the amount of
work to be done, and the Auditor states
that should the fund become exhausted
he will immediately Stop all work unless
; more money is provided by the Supervi
sors. , m
There is not enough office room in the
Auditor's quarters to accommodate the
i army of clerks who will begin their dv
' ties "on the 19th of this month, nlesa
the Supervisors provide room in the City
. all where the work can be done, Mr.
Wells Intends to rent quarters on the out
side.
Nettie R. Craven's Claim.
A demurrer to the petition filed by Mrs.
â  Nettie R. Craven askins that the decree
; of partial distribution heretofore made of
I properties of tin- estate of the late Janvs
1 G. Fair be set aside and vacated, was
partly heard by Judge Troutt yesterday.
; ft is "claimed by counsel for Mrs. Craven
that the decree of partial distribution
' should not have been made until the filing
' and settlement of the final account of th
i executors of the will, and that .Mrs. i 'ra
ven may now come in by virtue of her pe
tition and establish tieirship to the wid
ow's portion of the estate
On the other hand it is claimed that
; section 1664 of the Code of Civil Procedure
has been erroneously invoked by the j
claimant; that this section simply pro
vides the remedy for the establishment of ,
the status of heirs, and under its provi- '
slon action cannot be brought to deter- I
mine heirship. Further argument will be |
heard on the IStli inst. ]
ALAMEDA COUNTY NEWS.
TOO GALLANT
TO DENY THAT
HE PROMISED
Miss Hattie Isaacs Is
Sure He Did.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway. September 8.
Rudolph JYnnien will have to stan>l a
trial In the Superior Court fur break-
Ing his promises to Miss Hattie I-
He would not talu- the stand in his own
I- half and sw< ar that he had never urom
sed to marry his prosecutor.
Miss Isaacs made â â < very good witness
for herself, and testified that Permian had
i very positively promised to make her his
i wife on several occasions. Many wit
nesses wee produced by the defense w!r>
â  ided in Bhowing thai Mist H
conduct was such on various occi
that there might easily be a mistake aa
Ito who had promised to marry her. Bvl
â  dently during the past twelve months the
prosecuting witness has enjoyed lif ( -
was a frequent attendant at dances and
balls, and on one occasion essayed a part
in an amateur cakewalk. in spite of all
this testimony and much more incidental
thereto. Miss Hattie could not be shaken
In her statement that she would never
have prosecuted Permien htfd he not
made a distinct promise to marry her.
The defense did not put Rudolph Per
mien on the stand. Had he not been so
gallant as not to desire to contradict the
lady's testimony his troubles might now
; have been ended. His witnesses did suc
ceed in attai kins some -what the reputa
tion of the young lady, but the < !
adduced no direct contradiction of the
testimony regarding tht promise.
Judge Smith briefly summed up the sit
â¢ uation and said that the testimony before
the court alleging a promise to marry
was uncontradlctcd, and that therefore
the defendant must answer to the Su
perior Court for bis behavior.
POET'S TORRID WORDS
TO WOMAN SUFFRAGISTS
OAKLAND. Sept. B.â Mary Lambert,
the author of several clever poem: and
books, has undertaken the task of reply
ing to sonif ladies who have been publicly
â¢ xpre&ding their admiration for the gen
t-rally accepted theories of woman suf
frage. Miss Lambert, who is as w< 11
known as any lady in Alameda County
In semi-public life, evidently has n<> pa
tience and much !e=s sympathy with wo
man suffrage, so-called. In her publi hed
statement she says that woman will till
the place sne is competent i" fill and
fitted to till just as surely as man will.
Miss Lambert's vitriolic philippic is Â»li
rected against the recently published
statement of Mrs. M. L. W. Curtis, a
State leader of the suffrage movement,
and it is the most forceful essay on the
subject ever printed in Alameda County.
"When woman has progressed beyond
the sphere s!i> j i~ In," Bays Miss Lambert,
"a broader .one will come. Let her stay
where she is needed and re.-isr to fritter
her time away on thiiu,"* that need her
not. Is she needed in politics? I think
not. Wiil she better politics? I believe
not. Dear Mrs. Curtis, why don't you
married women who know al! about hand
ling men just coax and wheedle this
precious gift from the dear fellows, just
as v<i coax your sealskins, new bonnets
anil jewels? Hut what of tin- ma: sless
females? Why don't you suffragists take
up this point? It is not ridiculous for a
man t.> do a woman's work, nor woman
a man's when such is necessary. Man
proves himself lit to be the governing
power because he doeÃ his own work well
an.! because "f the added burden that
woman's incompetency and negligence
puts upon him. "

Fell Fifteen Feet on His Head.
OAKLAND. Sept. S.â John ( allahan. a
laborer, residing at 722 Second street.
while employed at the coal bunkers of
J. P. Taylor & Co. at the foot of Franklin
street to-day, fill from a ship's beam
head foremost into the hold, his head
landing upon a lump of coal. He had
fallen about fifteen feet, and was ren
dered unconscious. He was carried to the
Receiving Hospital, and it was thought
that his skull was fractured and his neck
broken, but Dr. Dukes found his injuries
to consist of several deep and ugly gashes
on the scalp, for which he was treated.
He was later taken to his home.
HIGH DIVER HARMON
RETURNS TO HIS HOME
Harry Harmon, the world-renowned
high diver, is once more on his native
beatb and greeting old friends. While he
has been away from home he has added
fame to his came as being the most dar
ing swimmer of the world. High bridges
have been "peaches and cream" to Har
mon. He has dived from their heights
turning somersaults and risking his neck
for th>' edification of onlookers or for
monetary rewards.
\ week ago he startled the residents of
Ft Louis by jumping fr.>m the F.a.ls
bridge, a distance of ninety feet, without
divesting himself of his clothe?. His dive
on that occasion was witnessed by a ear
] iad â¢â¢:' passengers, many Â°i" whom were
nol aware of Harmon's Intention. Ac
cording to accounts the daring Californlan
avoided the bridge watchman and also a
police officer who was detailed to watch
H-irmon and prevent him from endanger
ing his life. Another feat accomplished
by Harmon was to dive off a bridge at
Winona, Minn., a distance of 12S feet from
r .,j| to the water. This is the worlds
record for high diving, and Harmon con
fidently believes that it will never be
eaualed by any one. He has also lumped
from twelve bridges In two weeks' time,
ell of them not less than ninety feet from
the wafer.
In making these dives Mr. Harmon uses
what he calls the "layout" somersault.
};,. poises for a moment on his dizzy
height with bis back to the water, and.
falling off makes a dead drop, and while
in midair makes a complete revolution,
striking the water feet first. He has been
engaged In the dangerous business for the
p a |, Tin... n years without accident.
H-un-on is accompanied to the cit> by
S Forest Seabury. another famous high
diver Both men' are to give exhibitions
at the Chutes, and as their work is of a
sensational character they should be great
drawing cards.
The Surplus Funds.
â â¢What shall the citizens committee do
with the surplus funds lefi in Its hands?"
is the last pertinent question anent the
reception of the California Volunteers.
The committee will have nearly $40,000
after it has settled every bill, and what
to do with this money is a problem more
serious than appears at first glance, it
has been contributed by everybody and
its' expenditure must please everybody,
so' the problem grows as the necessity for
its solution becomes move apparent.
There have been several suggestions,
but they have not so far exceeded the
dignity of suggestions. "The teachers
have use for It," comes from one side,
and "the lights on the City Hall tower
bbo" on the ferry building tower should
be kept up" comes from another. I here
are also a few who have viewed the re
cent celebration with tear-dimmed eyes;
mothers who might have had sons in the
lines of blue and brown; wives woo might
have had husbands; children who might
have had fathers, if only the bullets had
not sped so truly. They might have some
suggestions as to what might be done
with the money. Tt rests with the com
mittee however, and it is certain nothing
will be done about the matter until it is
evident the right thing has been decided
upon.
Hibernians to Picnic.
Division No. -. A. o. n.. win give its
thirty-first annual picnic to-day at Har

this coast. A larger number of gate and
game prizes will be given out than ever
before, all of which are valuable.

Boat Capsized in tne Lake.
OAKLAND, Sept. x. -A party composed
of Miss JoEle Curtis, Misa Maud Good,
Albert Keyes and Charles Blaiteman,
while rowing on Laki Merritt last Mon
day evening, came to grief. Their boat
capsized and the Ladies were rescued by
thoir escorts, who proved themselves
heroes. No one was injured and the mat
ter had been kept a secret until to-day,
when it leaked out.
A WILD RUNAWAY
CAUSED A STAMPEDE
A horse attached to a covered wagon
belonging to John F. Snow & Co. dashed
down Market street yesterday afternoon
and caused a great deal of excitement
and some damage. Len Wiggins, th<
driver, left the horse standing outside a
store on Market Btreet, near Powell. The
horse became frightened and ran down
the main thoroughfare, gaining speed at
every bound. Pedestrians and drivers ol
vehicles were warned by the shouts ol
people on the sidewalk am! managed to
st.tr clear of th-- runaway. At Fourth
and Market street? Officer McNamara
made a valiant attempt to catch the
frightened animal, but it swerved and
continued down the street. When oppo-
Bite the Phelan building the swaying ve
hicle collided with a cart, breaking a hub
and spring. The collision did not In
the runaway, but turned it toward the
show windows of Nolan's shoestore. Th*
sidewalk was crowded at the time and
women and men ran screaming for p
of safety. Fortunately for the owners of
the shoestore the wheels of the vehicle
struck a heavy post at the curb, whirh
stopped its course.
The post was torn from its fastening
by the impact. But for Its presence the
horse would have crashed into the heavy
olateglass windows and done great dam
age and probably killed itself. A horse
attached to a buggy belonging to Mr.
Nolan was struck by the wagon as it
swung toward the sidewalk and brought
to its knees.

Arlington's Nemesis
Is Now Free.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
9 8 Broadway, Sept. 8.
Justice has once more smiled upon Mrs.
Minnie M. Smith, the woman who dared

arch bunko* r and hypnotist. Arthur Ar

man H. Smith, and the custody of the
minor child, over whom a most bitter
contest had been promised, was also
awarded to the plaintiff.
The divorce suit was riled several
19 ago, shortly after Mr?. Smith
had been robbed by Arlington, and at the
time a picture was published showing the
woman seated in Arlington's lap. The
husband lit came apprised of this rather
compromising incident and hastened West
from his home In Wisconsin to wage a
r legal battle over the divorce and
custody of the child. His threat was
backed by his sudden appearance In Oak

charge of robbing the wife was in prog-
No Booner had Arlington heen con

and offered no further contest In the di
vorce suit, which was Drought on the
ground of extreme cruelty.
The case came up for trial before Judge
;:;isv. i . and tr< m the testimony
of Mrs. Smith and her sisi r, Mrs. Alice
s. Ibert, the defendant husband was made
out a prince of home tyrants.
"We were married In Duluth, Minn., in
1893," said Mrs. Smith on the witness
stand, "and for a year or so got along
nicely. We had enough to wear and fon.i
to eat, as I bad some money when I mar-
Smith. Later we moved to
Madii in, Wis. My baby was six months
old and the house for several weeks after
i arrived there had no roof and no win
dows in it. J had to beg water from a
a mile away. Then we got a cow
and chickens, i>u t my husband would
spoil the milk so we couldn't use it. and
with the eggs he would bombard the
house. He would cut holes in my cloth
ing so 1 had luit one dress, and finally he
drew a revolver, threatening to kill me
and the child. I fled to a neighbor's houEC
a mile away and tried to get a warrant
for hi â¢ but was persuaded to re
turn to him.
"Lai r I went to live with my "ister at
Los Vi â  ' - Boon he followed me th< n .

we had n-i food in the house nor a nickel
to buy any. A cooked dinner was sent
by his mother's cousin, and my husband
poured coal oil over the chicken, so we
couldn't eat it."
Then followed similar acts Â«>f cruelty

the abused woman came to Oakland.
where she filed her suit.

IMPORTERS ARE GLAD
BECAUSE OF A RULING
MAY WITHDRAW FROM BOND
FOR EXPORTATION.
Borne weeks ago Customs Collector
Jackson, at the request of P. W. Bell
ingall, sent to the Secretary of the Treas
ury a letter asking that merchandise
may be allowed to be withdrawn from
! bond for exportation before liquidation.
A reply In the affirmative was received
yesterday, with the following letter in
closed and addressed to Secretary Gage
from G. K. Bidwell, Customs Collector of
the port of New York:
I have received a letter signed by the Col
lector of Customs at San Francisco, Cal.,
dated July 20, 1899, addressed to the Hon.
Secretary of the Treasury, respecting the
practice at thla port in regard to with
drawals from bond for exportation before
liquidation, which letter was referred to this
ofilce for report and return by department
Indorsement, dated the 29th ult., O. L.
lldillgr, Assistant. Secretary, A. J.
In reply 1 have to state that, the practice
at this port for many years in the matter
of withdrawals for export from an un
liquidated warehouse bond of merchandise,
paying a specific rate of duty has been to
note on the warehouse entry the words,
"Closed as entered for export only," which
may refer to the entire quantity covered by
the entry or to so much thereof as may be
desired.
In the case of merchandise paying an ad
valorem rate of duty the Appraiser's report
on Invoice Is required before permitting:
withdrawals for export. If no advance in
value or portion change of rate is made by
him the warehouse entry may then be closed
as entered, or as much thereof as may be
desired, and withdrawals for export per
mitted before the liquidation.
This method has been productive of no
| complication*, has proved perfectly satis
: factory in operation and has occasioned no
loss to the revenue. It is manifestly im
( practicable to frame a regulation to suit
every possible emergency, but it is.suggest
â¢ ed that the possibility of irregularity under
; this system is reduced to a minimum, if not
j entirely precluded, by the exercise of proper
care and Judgment in permitting with
drawals for export from unliquidated ware
, house bond of merchandise, paying a spe
cific rate of duty.
OFFICER WAGNER DEAD
Patrolman Rainsbury Has Been
Chosen to Succeed Him.
Police Officer August H. Wagner died
suddenly in a drugstore at the corner of

o'clock last evening. So far as can be
ascertained death was the result of
aneurism of the aorta. The body was
removed to the officer's home at 595 Noe
street, where an autopsy will be per
formi d.
Officer Wagner was appointed to the po
lice force on June 11. 189 L II. â¢ ha> Blnce
done corridor duty in the City Hall, and
was considered a most efficient and popu
lar officer. Yesterday afternoon he was
taken ill. and wis treated by Dr. Rlctfi
in the Treasurer's office. For* a tinif be
recover- il sufficiently to be taken to his
home, and when be started he was accom

he had another sinking spell, and was
taken to a drugstore, where he died. De

SAN MATEO FIGHTING

vice and gambling.
The agitation which this craftily
planned scheme has aroused is without
parallel in San Mateo County. From
t the county to the other ve
il pri tests are being made. San

Colma in fighting the rascals who are

â . Icious purposes dictate.
The struggle has now reached a crit

fluence to induce the Supervisors of San
Mateo to adopt a resolution prohibiting
gambling on horse races, except within
a racing inclosure, In the county.
This victory has now proved to be a
boomerang for Buckley and his follow
ers now want to do the very thing
which they prevented the other gamb
lens from doing. In the face of impend
ing disaster to all their interests they
have united and have secured control
of tha new coursing park near Colma.
The land is owned by John D. Daly and
ex-Sheriff Kenney. They have leased
it to Henry Schwartz, who has as
sociated with him Chris Buckley. Billy
Harrison, Sam Newman and K. E. de
B. Lopez.
These men do not want the park for
coursing, except as a blind. They want
it simply as a gambling hell for wagers
on the Eastern races. They want it as
an establishment for all sorts of gamb
ling, but under the law of San Mateo
they cannot use it for that purpose.
When Henry Schwartz wanted to erect
a gambling pavilion in San Mateo
County he offered to pay a license of
$3000 a year. Now he has a coursing
park with $600 a year license and the
law's barrier.
Buckley's fertile brain reasoned that
there was but one way out of the dif
ficulty and that was to incorporate
Colma as a town of the fifth class, giv
ing it all the rights of gambling. So
the plan was hatched. Touts were sent
to Colma to encourage the scheme and
to delude the citizens into its accept
ance. It was said that after the lit
tle town was incorporated a revenue of
between $30,000 and $40,000 would flow
into its coffers. The promoters of the
scheme did not say, however, that this
sum would be handled by officers
chosen and controlled by the gamblers.
They showed how every carriage pass
ing through the town could be com
pelled to pay a tax of $6 a year, but
they did not show that this tax would
be filtered into the hands of extrava- I
gant town officers.
But the people of the town of Colma i
.vere not deceived. They refused to
ittend the first meeting which the touts
lad arranged. Colma's citizens knew
:hat they would have no voice in the i
meeting and even if they did they ,
A-ould have no material part to play in
:he proposed election. They knew that
the floating vote of employes at the
c-emeteries and a mob of roustabouts
would be imported to carry the
-amblers into power. The little town
vvould be absolutely at the mercy of the i
â¢ascals from San Francisco.
Notwithstanding 1 the opposition of the :
leopie of Colma the gamblers are de
ermined to win. They have taken the
natter into their own hands entirely
since the citizens of Colma could not be
leludod into co-operation and to-night
hey propose to ask the Supervisors for
he privilege of a special election. The
iroposed area of the gamblers' town
a ill be between Holy Cross Cemetery
md the ocean and the northern line of
he county. If the Supervisors permit
he election to be held they will do so
i gainst the earnest protest of every de
â¢nt element in the entire county.

citizens ol isan Mateo Denounce
the Outrageous Scheme in
Unmeasured Terms.
REDWOOD city. Sept. B.â Chris Buck
ley, the "blind white devil," and his
henchmen will not get through his scheme
for the incorporation of Colma and the
loading up of San Mateo County with all
. imbler? and thugs that other coun
ties have unloaded, if the opinion of the
people of San Mateo County can influence
the Board of Supervisors. "Damnable,"
said niie prominent citizen of Redwood
City to-day.
"What is too bad for San Francisco,"
said Rev. Father Conlan of the Catholic
church, with fine sarcasm, "surely can
not be good enough for San Mateo Coun
ty. Incorporate Colma and so put tho
gamblers into power? It is outrageous!"
"1 wish," said Rev. Mr. Maar of the
Congregational church, "that thoro could
be some neutral place like the midd!.- ol
the sea, where these gamblers coul.i be
taken to and dumped in all together. It
would be infamous for the Supervisors of
this county to act in any way that can
help the gamblers to locate themselves in
our county to commit their nefarious acts.
1 do not believe that they will dare to do
it."
Still, there Is a feeling manifested gen
erally of apprehension, of fear that the
Hoard of Supervisory may aid in the In
corporation of Colma; and there are no
two opinions concerning the purpose of
the proposed incorporation, which is sole
ly to give the gambl-rs who have been
driven out of the. other counties around
the bay full swing in this county. There
are no members of the Board of Super
visors residing here. The full list of
mnmliers of the board and their resi
.:â  es are herewith given, and It may je
well for the public to bear the list in

important matter.
Scores of representative citizens of Red- 1
WOOd City were interviewed to-day. Not
one waf found who would say that he
thought ttyat it would be a good thing to
Intrench the gamblers at Coima by the
dodge of incorporation. One or two were
found who said that perhaps the people
Ol Colma were the best Judges of their
own interest in the matter of incorpora
tion. They did not know or wholly ig
nored the fact that if incorporation could
be brought about. Buckley, Schwartz
Harrison and their gang would surely
own the trustees and license all the
gambling games. Not one of these who
said that perhaps Colma could best judge
I for Itself was willing to go on record to
! say that it would be a good thing to have
gamblfrs and blacklegs in control of one
end of the county. Every one recognized
the fact that there was danger.

WHY MARK THALL
WONT GO TO PARIS
| -â  r ARK THALL and Fred Belaseo
' l\/l have been shaking dice. Al
* I VI though to those who know
', -L"-i- the gentlemen in question this
may not seem a very surprising state
â¢ ment, there are circumstances sur
? rounding this particular episode which
% add to it a special flavor of Interest.
âº In the first place, both the actors In
$ the little drama, though ea.cn is gifted
âº with a vivid imagination, tell the
8 same story regarding It; and in the
> second place, the result means that
' Fred Belasco Is to take a glorious trip
1 to Paris, revel in the delights of the
jj* exposition and, visiting London on his
j way bark, bring home .with him a
> quartet of English dramatic lights to
add luster to the Alcazar stock com
pany.
The shaking of the dice was Belas
co's own idea. It was he who evolved
the dual plan of business and pleasure
and proposed It to Thall, who, being
ordinarily the traveling member of
the firm, assented to it with alacrity.
"It Is an excellent Idea." he said,
"and I will bring home some actors
who will make the Alcazar falrly
scintillate. likewise. I will bring you
a necktie from Paris, Fred, picked
out with an eye single to your own
peculiar but irresistible style of
beauty."
"I prefer to buy my own neckties,
returned Belasco, with acerbity, "and
besides vou'vo already been to New
York. It's my turn tn travel now,
and I'm willing to sacrifice myself for
the good of the theater and endure all
the miseries of mal de mer while you
are safe and happy right here at
home."
"1 ain't homesick." declared Mark,
tersely. "Maybe you think you can
play <">ff my trip to that superheated
furnace of a great metropolis as a
picnic, but you can't. That was a
first installment of purgatory, and
now I want something different. The
theater pays the bills, so it can't mat
ter to you; and I'm the walking dele
gate of this association, anyway."
The dispute waxed so loud that peo
ple on the outside thought Belasco
was training a new soubrette, but
Anally a bright idea occurred to the
proposer of the expedition.
"Say. Mark." lie suggested, "don't
let's quarrel about a measly thing like
a trip to Parisâ let's shake for the
"All right." returned Thall, who is
usually particularly fortunate when
he and Belasco go out together and
shake for icecream sodas, root beer,
ginger ale, pink lemonade and such
things; and so the two got the "mus
cot" die which has long been pre
served among their valuable curios
and proceeded to settle the matter
then and there. Each was to throw
the die twelve times in succession,
and the one who camo out ahead on
the dozen throws should be the one to
make the pilgrimage to Paris.
Thall confident of victory, started
the game and threw four, three, .sir

"Telephone down to the trunk fac

Deputy Coroner Claude Fox said that
there was no question that giving the
ramblers what they seek at Colma,
trough the trick of incorporation, would
I arm San Mateo County. No good could
"ome of it. Some more business might be
made for the Coroner, but that was not
what is sought for by the public. He Is
strongly opposed to incorporation.
Dr J I-< Ross, president of the Bank
of San Mateo County, said that he could
not favor any move that would lead to
the establishment of gambling games.

ing He had no doubt that a victory for
the gamblers at Colma would have a bad
effect The Colma movement surely would
not be favored by the good people of

SC "There is this about It." said Judge
Hannon, and all honest people in Colma
who pay taxes will find food for reflec-
on in considering his words, "the people
up there â  will . have to pay much larger
taxes If incorporation goes through. They
will still have the State and county taxes
to pay and also a town tax: to that
would also have to be added the expense
of paving local officials." Judge Hannon
was one of the very. few who expressed
the opinion that Colma people were the
best ones to settle what they would do.
Rev Mr Maar of the Redwood Con
gregational church did not Â harbor any
delusion that the honest people of Colma
reaJlv desire to be saddled with the bur
den of gambling games. He was satisfied
that the gamblers were . back of the
scheme on foot. "I wish there was some
neutral place." said the Rev. Mr. Maar
"where gamblers could be taken out and
dropped into the middle of the sea. Ttou
need have no doubt where I stand. The
gamblers should not be allowed to get
'"it i?Â°rsÂ»iied as a matter of history at
this point that when the gamblers were
running some games in San Mateo County
something more than a year ago Rev.
Mr?Maarand Rev. Mr. Hester the pastor
of the Methodist church of Redwood, pre
sented a petition asking that the pest
should be abated. That was not the pres
ent but the preceding Board of Supervi
sors The evil was then in a much less
aggravated shape than is now threatened
Nevertheless, only two members stood
squarely up for the suppression of the
evil at first; two others hung back but
came in. But the representative of Â« olma
would not vote. The petition had quite a
list of names attached to it. but nothing
like what could have been secured with a
little longer time. â¢
Here are some extracts from the peti
tion which have their significance once
more as showing the attitude of the good
t.eoDle of this section concerning the es
tablishment of gambling In the county:
'â¢In and near Colma. in the county of
San Mateo there is at present maintained
and conducted the lowest and most vicious
form of gambling, known as 'pool-selling
on foreign horse races': that these so
called 'pool sellers' conduct establish
ments where men, women and children are
enticed In to gamble in small amounts on
horse races tnat are supposed to be de
cided in Eastern cities.
"These poolrooms are the primary
an ace, and Belasco began to sit up
and take notice. Then came a four,
then another four, and Belasco rolled
his eyes heavenward toward the pic
tures of the stage beauties which
adorn the managerial waJls, and
steeled his heart to suffer. An ace
followed, and Belasco smiled again,
but stopped abruptly when a five
stared him out of countenance.
"What kind of a necktie would you
really prefer, Fred 9 " asked Mark,
kindly, but he desisted from his in
quiries when an ace marie Its unwel
come appearance, closely followed by
a deuce. In all he had" made thirty
seven, and Fred started in on his star
engagement with a trepidation which
he valiantly concealed.
"Now watch me." he said courage
ously, "and I'll give you pointers how
to play this little game"; and then he
showed up a five, six. deuce and four,
one after the other.
"Say, Bob," he said to the lone spec
tator, "just telephone down to that
factory again and get 'em to change
those initials on that trunk to F. 8.,
and add a grip and a dress-suit case
to the order for luck."
"Don't hurry. Bob." interposed
Mark as an ace and two trays ap
peared; "let my order stand with
Fred's additions, and send to my
tailor to start in on the swellest
steamer togs he ever dreamed of."
Another ace and a deuce met Be
lasoo's disgusted eyes, then an Inad
equate and apologetic tray. Ten of
those dozen throws were gone, and he
was seven behind the smiling and
confident Mark.
"Be particular to feed the cats
while I am away, Fred," continued
the prospective winner; "the white
one can't eat anything hut raw liver,
you know, because he's delicate; and
the other â "
"Bother take your cats!" interrupt
ed Belasco. "Say. Mark"âlngratiat
inglyâ"l'm sure to beat you, anyway,
for I've only eight to make; but to
save your feelings I'll give you $100
and call It square."
"What's $10fi to a trip to the exposi
tion with all the expenses paid?' re
turned Mark. "I'm satisfied with the
show I'm getting; go ahead."
"Five twenties," pleaded Belascoâ
"nice, new shiny ones, just from the
mint. I'll see to It personally; 'pon
my word I will."
"Go ahead!" commanded Thall in-
exorably, blindly trusting fickle for- 4
tune. "I'll get more than $100 worth
of fun on my trip just thinking how Â«
you are enjoying my good luck. <.â¢
Hurry up, Fred." a'
Fred hurried obediently, and turned m
up a trey. Mark fairly crowed. 4
â¢Everybody who is anybody is going ~
to the exposition." he declared! 'v â¢
shall cross the continent In a private â¦
car filled with flowers, and all the Al- S8
cazar company will go to the station â¦
to bid me farewell." rÂ»
Belasco made no reply, but gathered \
himself for a linal effort. Once, twice cÂ»
he raised his hand above the table â¢
and then tossed the fateful cube. *
"I guess I'll cancel all those other *"
dates, Mark." he said quietly the next â¦
instant, "for I've concluded to star by i*
my lonely and make my season iii â¦
fashion's giddy capital. That hundred ;Â»
you didn't want, my hoy. will help +
me out wonderfully In extras." <â¢

evi table result of which is that in a few
years the Innocent youth is graduated a
hardened criminal, who, disgraced and
dishonest, an outcast of society, is ban

1 ho Followers uf the noolrooms are the
vicious, the weak and the immoral and
they contaminate where they are tol
erated.
"The city of Kan Francisco, considering
poolrooms ulcerous .sores, which were
spreading contamination throughout the
city, and the good citizens, encouraged by
the pulpit and the press, soon had pro
hibitory legislation passed which ban
isned them from the confines of the city
and county. It seems that tho evil which
San Francisco forbade i* now finding en
couragement In San Mateo County which
has always been considered socially the
first county In tho State."
The final clause of that petition, which
was approved by a former Board of Su
pervisors 01 San Mateo County serves
well for the present occasion to express
public sentiment here, which the present
Board of Supervisors must heed, and it is
therefore given in full as follows:
"We believe that you, gentlemen, con
scious of your duty and the trust reposed
in yon, will sustain our protest against
San Mateo County being made the dump
ing ground of the State for all the evil
that the State contains, and will perma
nently prohibit all gambling on horse rac-
Intr or evils of liko nature."
That Is the essence of public opinion
hero, compact and direct.
The petition was read In two churches.
The people signed it. Then the two cler
gymen before named, Rev. Mr. Maar and
Rev. Mr. Hester, appeared before the
Board of Supervisors and added burning
words of protest orally to the protesta
tions made In writing.
The Board of Supervisors will not meet
again until the third Monday in Septem
ber. A mooting was held last Tuesday,
but the I'oima matter was not then
brought tip. It Is not certain when Buck
ley and his pals will see fit to put the
matter to a vote before che Supervisors.
The shape in which the proposition will
be put Is a petition asking tho Supervisors
to call a special election at Colma, a dis
trict of which tho boundaries are a lint-
between Holy Cross Cemetery and th<>
ocean, and from there to the northern
county line, on incorporation. No petition
for the special election has yet been filed

ITALIAN SCHOOL
IS DIVIDED BY A
PEDAGOGIC ROW
Old Teacher Starts a
Rival Class.
The board of directors that controls the
destinies of the Italian Government
School hcis dismissed from its staff Mrs.
I Margherita Mosca, who for nine years
officiated as principal of the institution.
As a direct result of the dismissal the
school mourns the loss of over one hun
dred pay pupils, while the Italian colony
lM,;,sts another school established under
the direction of the discharged instructor.
The Italian school flourishes after the
regulation daily school hours in the Le
Coiite Primary School building on Powell
street, between Jackson and Washington.
I An annuity of $bw provided by the Italian
I Government sutftces to cover the regular
I expenses of the school, which up to sev
| eral weeks ago was presided over oy a
principal and a staff of three teachers.
Now the newly elected president of the
board. G. Almagia, adds to his many du
ties that of principal, and the staff has
pained in the addition of a new teacher.
The fact that the board of directors rec
j ognized the old saying that "teachers are
j born, not made" is accountable for the
whole trouble in the Italian school.
Mrs. Mosca is a graduate of a renowned
Italian university. Mrs. Theretse Ghl
; bandl does not even possess a teacher's
I certificate. However, the result of Mrs.
| Ghibandi's labors has been so won
drously satisfactory that the__ilirectors
suw fit to conipiend her above the princi
pal. When the board began to eompli
nit nt the work of Mrs. Ghibandi Mrs.
Mosca began to find fault with the lady,
! and the result was a series of petty rows
: thru became so offensive to the directors
that Mrs. Mosca's dismissal was ordered.
When Mrs. Mosca found herself school
lf-ss she looked around for other worlds to
conquer and decided to establish a rival
Italian school in Washington-square Hall
in the Bersaglieri building on Stockton
street. No charge for tuition is demanded
at the Government School, and a monthly
I foe is optional. Mrs. Mosca fixed the tui
tion at her school at 50 cents per month.
One hundred of her old pupils joined the
school of the dismissed teacher and the
1 result is the Mosca School has all the pay
: pupils, the Government school 150 pupils
that enjoy the generosity of the good
Italian King. When Mrs, Mosca was re
nioved from the Government School Mrs.
Julfa Bossi. who hnd been dismissed by
1 the lady, was reinstated, and she, with
Mrs Therese Ghibandi. the innocent cause
of all the trouble; Miss Catherine Bonglo
vanni. and Mrs. M. Marza, now consti
tutes the entire staff of the school. The
board of directors of the Government
School are: G. Almngia. A. L. Bacigalupi,
! S. Paganini. G. Ertola, G. B. Cavaglia, U
â¢ Torre, A. Ferromarlaro. E. Scodr-letti. N.

BUILDING THE MAN TO SEE.
When the delegates to the Democratic
I Nominating Convention were chosen there
was great rejoicing over the announce
ment that independent, untrammeled anti
boss citizens would take the reins of the j
party and nominate a clean ticket. At
the organization of the convention anti
: boss declarations were greeted with ap
plause.. When the applause subsided the ;
delegates meekly accepted the typewrit- j
; ten programme prepared by Gavin Me-
Nab and adjourned to the call of the j
chairman.
There lias been no session of the nomin- j
ating body since the adjournment three |
weeks ago, but the work of preparing a I
Democratic ticket has been going right j
along all the time at the Mills building
Without the assistance of delegates. The
clever programme which Boss McNab
prepared practically takes the selection of
candidates for Supervisors from the dele
gates and transfers the duty to a com
mittee of seven.
It must be clear by this time to the
boss-ridden Democratic Convention that j
Gavin McNab and Mayor Phelan sug
gested to Jasper McDonald the propriety
of appointing K. V. Whiting, John F. 'â 
Renault, Maurice Lowenstein, John H.
Grady, Louis de F. Bartlett, P. H. .Mc-
Carthy and A. W. Thompson a committee
to find eighteen acceptable candidates for
the Bjard of Supervisors. It is well
; known to insiders and outsiders that nor
n! inees tor Mayor and Assessor are slated. j
I To the insiders it is known that nominees
for Sheriff and District Attorney are al-
I ready on the slate. The rest of the pro
i gramme will be furnished to the conven- I
tion in installments- from the Mills build- |
ing. The well posted disciples of reform
Democracy go no higher than the seventh
floor to reach the source of nominating
I inspiration. , , ..
The delegates to the convention placed
I the lever controlling the Democratic party
machine in the hands of Gavin McNab
when they adopted a resolution giving 1
I Jasper McDonald, chairman, the power to <
appoint forty members of the County !
Committee. The delegates then surren- ,
dered themselves to McNab's dictation !
and must now take what he offers. As a
> boss he is inflexible. He will interpret the
articles of capitulation to suit himself.
Much sympathy is extended to unsophis
ticated aspirants for office who are going
I around soliciting the favor of del- ;
', egates to obtain nomination. The
trained politicians who have had ex
perience in political campaigns view the
spectacle with a sense of humor. The
aspirants, with the exception of a few
"rookies," are posted and therefore invite
signals of approval from "Me" in the
Mills building. The uninitiated may Infer
that Jasper McDonald is the proper one ;
to see, but The Call, not desiring to mis
lead good citizens who are about to offer
their services to the public, takes this oc
casion to Indicate that Gavin McNab is
the proper one to address. All those hav
i ing business with the Democratic local
convention should apply to him for infor- .
i mation. He is the real, true name-blown
: in-the-bottle boss. What be says goes.

How to Learn Spanish in Six Weeks.
At the Y. M. C. A. this afternoon at 4:30,
and this evening at S o'clock, Professor
W. F. Hall will give a free lecture illus
trating his natural method, a method
which has made it possible for busy men
and women to gain a practical working
knowledge of the essentials of Spanish in
a remarkably short time. Professor Halls
groat success is due largely to the skillful
manner In which he makes his meaning
clear without the use of English, thus
making the learner think Spanish and
apeak Spanish from the start. â¢

THE SHRINERS'
WELCOME GUESTS
Red Fez Aglow in
Islam Temple.
Hundreds of nobles of the Ancient Ara
bic Order of the Nobles of the Mystic
Shrine assembled last night in the hall of
Islam Temple, on Sutter street, for the
double purpose of tendering a grand wel
come to Colonel Victor D. Duboce, the
recorder of the temple, who returned
from Manila with the First California,
and to several other warriors who re
turned at the same time, and to help
sixty-seven novices in their journey
across the "hot sands" of the desert.
The temple's camel, faithful Old Ben,
who has served the temple since ISS3 and
during that time has carried a great
number of nobles and novices, and a num- j
ber of frisky young camels, were trotted
out to form a gorgeous procession along
the pathway of the devotees in their en
deavor to solve Oriental mysteries. The J
animals, after three months' rest, were i
quite frisky, and the novices began to
think that they were sure-enough rough
riders.
The advice to those who were anxious to
become nobles of the Mystic Shrine waa
that if they hud a will to make they
should do so before going through the
ceremony of initiation; that if they did
not have mantelpieces at home they had
better provide themselves with those use- :
ful ornaments in their respective homes, ]
as they would find them very desirable ;
as dining-tables tor some time to come;
that if tney could neither sing nor dance :
they would have to notify Charles L,. ;
Field, the potentate, or Theo trolich, the
acting noole recorder, and that they
should be satislied with the assurance j
that there would be nothing in the digni- ;
lied and elevating cen mony of induction ;
into the mysteries of the temple that tn.y
would not cheerfully recommend to their ;
friends with the possible exception ot the
â¢'hot sands," and that only when they be- â 
came overheated. Tney were also advised |
that if they themselves got a little too
much caloric they would only have to tell
the director, who wiAild order the Nubian i
slaves to scatter cracked ice under their j
feet to reduce the temperature.
The ceremony ot initiation was wit- |
nesaed by 333 nobles, all wearing red tez \
caps. All the spectators declared that it
was a grand Bight and that the camels j
were unusually lively, an assertion that
was not disputed by the novices.
The ceremony being over there were a
few words of welcome to the noble re
corder, Colonel Victor O. Duboce, and the
other nobles who returned from the I nil- <
lpplnes. Then there was a march to the |
main assembly hall, where there were ar- j
ranged several rows ot tables, which
groaned under the weight of good things
which had been deftly and artistically
placed upon them. There were seats tor
400 and every seat was occupied. The
hail was artistically decorated in a man
ner that gave the place a decidedly Ori
ental air. and when all were seated the I
Â«cene presented was one that was "a
thing of beauty and a joy" while the fun
lasted, and it can be stated that it was
not until long after 1 o'clock in the morn
ing that the fun ceased. The special
guests were at the head of the table in j
military uniforms, the nobles wore their |
fez caps and the novices or newly ere- j
ated nobles were at their places in full
dress suits.
True to the traditions of Islam, neither
the members of the temple nor the
stranger? within their gates were allowed
to depart until th.Mr appetites were ap
peased, for they were bidden to partake
freely of the food and drink that was
placed before them. The menu was an
elaborate one. and each and every
shriner did ample justice to the mysteries
prepared by the chefs.
Past Imperial Potentate Charles Fields
and at present potentate of the temple
presided in the capacity of toastrmister,
and as there was no set programme he
called for responses to toasts as the spirit
moved him. Those who responded were
