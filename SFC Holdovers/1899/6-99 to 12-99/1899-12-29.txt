1 / famous story of the Tichborr.e
l/ claimant Is revived by advices
y brought from Australia on the
rteamer Aorangi. The Govern
ment of Now South Wales is so impressed
with the probability that an inmutc of the
Farramatta Insane Asylum, known as
William CretwelU may be Sir Roger Tlch
borno that It has appointed a commission
to Inquire int>> the antecedents of Cres
wcll and to investigate the circumstances
connected with the Incarceration. Prrpu
iar opinion In Sydney is favorable to the
claim that Creswell Is really Tichborne.
and some members of the commission are
strongly cf the same belief.
The report of Drs. Plckhurn and Devlin,
who were deputed to examine William
Creswell with a view of deciding whether
lie bore marks known to have been on the.
body of Sir Roger Tichborne. has been
jirrjÂ«entfi to the Parliament <>f Now South
Wales. Twenty-two physical marks of
the real Knp. r Tichborne wore enumer
ated for the benefit of the examining phy
sicians, ard these two doctors found that
Oreswll possessed i)ract!cally all of these
marks and characteristics.
There are only two circumstances In
which Creswell fails to correspond with
the evidence of the doctors to signs which
are admitted to bo borne by the missing
TVhborne. oil" of thet^e is that there are
no marks as of bleeding cuts on Crcs
weirÂ« ankles. Ilut the cxumlning physi
cians iK'lnt out that such marks might
warily have been obliterated on the legs
after long years. The other and appa

while recently there have been
skirmishes in the neighborhood
of [nhlawe Mountain.
From Ladysmhh comes the
news that the town has been
shelled. We are not told
whether the Boer shells are
bursting better here than else
where, but the fists of casualties,
which of late have been longer,
lend countenance to the suppo
sition.
A Chteveley telegram of
Wednesday's date reports the
sound of heavy bombardment h
the direction of Ladysmith, and
the Boers are probably re
doubling their efforts to render
General White's position unten
able.
The Boer force at Magersfon
tein had a false alarm on Tuesday
night, suddenly opening a very
heavy tire. The British cavalry
have reconnoitered to the north
east, while other reconnpissances
have been carried out near Ens
lin.
There have been reports of
Boer detachments near General
Methuen's line of communica
tion. Of course action in this di
rection by the Boers was antici
pated, but Genera] Methuen
seems confident of holding his
own and keeping the line to his
rear open. After all he is on the
spot and the best judge of what
is expedient, but it is obvious
that he is in a very exposed posi
tion.
The Kinihcrlfv garrison con
tinues active. On Sunday last a
ceconnoissance was made with
| mounted troops, and three of
the enemy's guns were located.
A similar reconnaissance on the
Wednesday preceding by mount
ed troops, assisted by an artillery
i force, advanced into Free State
territory. The Roers were met
with some artillery, and firing
'ensued. The Kimberlev force
[ ultimately retired, as the ]) -
were strongly intrenched. These
\ sallies serve to keep the Boers at
a respectable distance and also
determine the position of their
guns and outposts.
The War Office is now recog
nizing more and more the im
portance of mounted troops. The
Government first accepted 3000
volunteers and yeomanry, and
last night it asked Lord ( iresh-
am's committee to furnish 10,000
yeomanry to he used as mounted
infantry. The first Latch of
1000 will probably sail in the
second week of January.

HONOLULU, Dec. IR.-Honolulu has

visited with a touch of the bubonic

with which President Henry 11 Cooper of

has prevented a calamity.
The first case w:ts reported on the 32th.

no deaths from the plague since Tuesday,
the 12th. Chinatown, the seat of tne
trouble, is now undergoing a thorough
cleaning and it is believed the BCOQrge

The ifixih Artillery has quarantined

Post Honolulu. They are confined strictly
to camp and not allowed to vit.lt any other
place. The National tJ"3ard ha* instruc

Colonel Deck of the transport Warren

STORY OF THE TREATY
WITH PORTUGAL DENIED
RERLIN. TVv. 2*.â Regarding th* state
ment by the I.,okfil AnzclÃer that a secret
AngKÂ»-German-Portuguese treaty exists
tor the division of the Portuguese colo
nies In Fouth Aft lea, the correspondent of
the Associated Press is nble to assert on
the highest authority that the story is a
pure fiction. The high official who author
izes this denial made the following decla
ration:
"There is no objection to statlnz that
the understanding had by Great Britain.
Germany and Portugal refers only to
Africa and leaves Asia wholly out of the
account. It Is quite certain, however,
that Germany under no consideration
would conclude, such a bargain with
Portugal as thÂ«- Ix>kal Ar.rclgor nets forth.
Any one with the slightest political sense
ought to see that tht-se tiny enclaves In
thr midst of British India are the last
colonial possessions Germany would
dream of."
LONDON. Dec. 2?.â Tho Standard says
that no rre-dlt should be piven to the ru
mor from Ilrrlin of a Fe-cret Anglo-Ger
man-Pnrtupufso troaty for the partition
of tho colonies of Portugal.
The Standard further says: "Lord Salis
bury would be reluctant to bring pressure
to bear uj>on Portugal except In a case of
urgent necessity. Great Britain would
prefer not to place herself in the invidious
position of using fnrcÂ«Â» toward another
petty country, and there is no temptation
to raise any further international ques
tions."
WASHINGTON. Dec. a.â Nothing Is
known here of the reported intention of
Great Britain and Gcsqiany to partition
Portuguese Kant Africa between them.
Great Britain taking the country around
IVlagna Bay and southward and Germany
tho northern half of the territory, which
adjoins the German But African posses
rlons. ThÂ«Â» officials here attach no cre
dence to the story, because, us they point
out. a movement of this kind, disturbing
the balance of power in Africa, would load
nlmnst certainly to serious complications
between the principals and tho other pow
ers of Europe. More'ovor. the old rumor
of a nocret troaty between England and
Portugal, whereby the former might for
a proper consideration possess itself of
IVlagoa Bay whenever the place is needed
for military purposes, has always bven
credited to somÂ«> extent here, and If such
treaty really exists there would be no
need for Germany's participation, as re

CONGRESSMAN BOUTELLE
IS RESTING EASILY
Relative Announces That His Trouble
Is Congestion of the Brain,
Due to Overwork.
BOSTON. Dec 28.â While the officials
of th<Â» McLean Hospital are extremely
reticent in the matter of giving details as
to the condition of Congressman C. A.
Boutelle of Maine, it was stated in re-
FiKinbe to an Inquiry to-night that Mr.
lioutelle had passed a very comfortable
day and that he was not considered In
any immediate danger.
A relative of Mr. lioutelle is quoted as
Faying that the latter' trouble is conges
tion" of the brain, the. result of continued
strain and overwork in connection with
his official duties. His condition previous
to the removal to the hospital was such
that at times he became delirious and It
was difficult to keep him under "Control.
It was deemed best under the circum
stances to place him in an Institution
where he could receive the best possible
treatment, and the McLean Hospital at
Waverley was selected as such a place.
The relative above mentioned expresses
confidence that the patient will quickly
recover and be able In the near future to
resume his duties at Washington.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, DECEMBER 29, 1899.
HAVOC WROUGHT BY THE RECENT
EARTHQUAKE IN SAN JACINTO
Riverside County Hospital.
THE accompanying photograph?,
made especially for The Call, serve
to illustrate the terrible havoc
wrought in Ban Jacinto early
Christmas morning by the most se
vere earthquake felt In the south
ern portion of the State in many years.
Although almost every building in the
city was ruined by the seismic disturbance,
the loss of life was, fortunately, very
small. An adobe building in which a num
ber of aged squaws were holding a Christ
mas celebration collapsed. Six were killed
outright and many injured. Of those, two
died on the following day. This was the
only loss of life. /
The loss of property, however, was very
great. Heavy timbers. and tons of loose
plaster ruined the stcck in almost 'every
Store in the city, and prosperous mer
chants find themselves almost pennlles*.
The wooden buildings, as usual, resisted
the strain better than the brick struct-.
ures, but the majority of these are hope
lessly sprung. Tthe brick buildings pre
sent a sorry sight. All are cracked from
top to bottom, and in most cases the wa ||
spread so much that the roofs fell in.
A special providence seemed to watch
over the patients In the County Hospital
in South San Jacinlo. The build ss
ruined and must be torn down, but not one
of the helples invalids was Injured. Their
escape is considered almost miraculous.

OF INTEREST TO
THE PACIFIC COAST
Colonel H. B. Freeman at the Pre
sidio Is Slated for a Brig-adier
Generalcy.
WASHINGTON. Dee. â .â Colonel Vyee
man of the Twenty-fourth Infantry will
reUrr January 17, IStt, and there is every
probability that he will reach the grade
of brigadier general long: before that
date. The policy adopted by the War De
partment since the advent of Secretary
Root at its head has been to give the
highest possible rank to army officers
who have distinguished themselves before
their retirement. A large number of ofll
een are to be retired soon, and opportuni
ties will be afforded to live Colonel Free
man a star. His long and faithful service
i~ recognized by the department, and at
the tirpt opportunity he will be rewarded,
but promotions are made now in order of
precedence and Colonel Freeman will
doubtless come in his turn.
The death of General Lawton has made
a vacancy in the regular establishment,
which will be filled soon. The officer pro
moted will retire within a short time and
create a new vacancy. it li the policy of
the department to advance officers who
have come up from the line, as has Colo
nel Freeman. He entered the army as a
private in 1855, and is not a West Pointer.
This record will commend him to Secre
tary Root, who looks at merit and not the
source from which a soldier comes. He
will also receive the indorsement or Gen
eral Miles, who Is himself a product of
the ranks and not of West Point. <
The omnibus claims bills introduced by
Senator Teller, v which include claims
of California for $3,951,915 and of Oregon
for $335,152, will probably be among the
first to be considered by the Senate. This
bill would have passed last Congress had
Delegations from the coast been unani
mously favorable, but lack of unanimity
caused its failure in the House. Senators
White and Perkins succeeded In passing
the bill through the Senate.
Senator Perkins is confident that the
claim will pass the Senate and there la
hardly any doubt but that the House will
allow the matter to go before the Court of
Claims. Representative Neednam is a
member of this committee and is giving
the matter his full attention.
The following Pacific Coast claims are
also among Items in Teller's bill:
To Frank and Susan F. de la Torre,
heirs of Peter de la Torre, deceased, late
District Attorney for the Northern Dis
trict of California, $10,000 for extraordi

DEED THAT STIRRED
THE AMERICAN NATION
Destruction of the Maine, the Notatle
Events That Followed, Closing With
the Last Honors to the Departed
Heroes Yesterday.
YESTERDAY was a day of mourn
ing for the nation, for in the
national cemetery of Arlington ih.
bodies of the murdered sailors of
the Maine were interred in ever
lasting rest. The sad and solemn rites
performed by a sorrowing nation over its
dead possessed a d*ep and worthy mean
ing to every man woman and child In the
I'nited States. Millions of people saw in
sympathy of thought and In mental pic
ture the sad procession that made its way
through the avenues of Arlington. Millions
of American dtxens again felt the horror
of the tragedy. that, by war and destruc
tion and death to American sroldierÃ. is
Still a living dread, and not a memory of
national sadness.
In countless homes, where war has
brought the sorrows of death, the eero
monies yesterday meant the closing scene
of a national tragedy that was to become
the beginning of â :â â :â  saddest trials.
Poantlers thousands of Americans Knr-w
ycrterday. with sadder meaning than they
feared on February 16. IS^S. what th.- de
struction of the Maine would cost in lives
and money and national dignity; for many
thourands of lives have been lost and the
sacrifice is not yet over. Millions of dol
lars have been spent and the expenditure
Is not yet ended. National dignity has
been defended, but it has not yet been
won
The burial of the saiiors at Arlington,
therefore, was something far more deeply
significant than a proof that America hon
ors and respects its dead. It taught more
than one object lesson in national life ar.d
policy, and recalled many scenes that
have stirred the people of two nations.
When President McKlnley. in his annual
rm-ssage in December, ISItT. declared *bat
the butchery of Cuban reconeentrados by
Spanish soldiers must stop, the wisest in
the nation could not foresee the Issue.
The war in Cuba bad degenerated into
savage slaughter of human beings. Amer
icans had been excited nnd angered into
sympathy for the oppressed Cubans, but
few believed thnt the United States would
take* up arms nÂ«ainst the oppressor.
When the President Issued a call to
Americans to aid the stnrvlnff reconeen

TARIFF TREATY
WITH ARGENTINE
Its Effect Upon the Wool
Trade.
Bpeelal Dispatch to Th# Call.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 2S.â The following
official statement of facts respecting: the
Argentine convention Is given out for
public Information and to correct many
misapprehensions In respect to the effect
of the treaty on the wool Interest:
The Argentine tariff system Involves not only
a fixed and high rate of duties on Imports, but
also provides for an aforo, or valuation, which
is to be fixed from time to time by executive
authority. By this . system duties are often
effectually increased without any new legisla
tion, and at the will of executive officers.
The object of the United States was, there
fore, to obtain reductions of th.- tariff on our
exports as tar as poaotble, and to reduce the
aforo, or else to establish a valuation beyond
which they could not go as the basis for assess
ing duties.
The convention, for example, not only secures
to Untted States exporters a reduction on Ore
gon pine lumber and Southern lumber. In fact
all kinds of undressed â  lumber, but fixed the
af.'t.j and. on Oregon and yellow pine reduces
It over Â»0 per cent. The duty on cotton-seed
oil Is reduced about 60 per cent. On bacon and
many food products It Is reduced by 20 pel cent.
On paraffin. â¢ wax (largely In demand there) the
charges were prohibitive and the duty Is now
reduced 00 per cent and the aforo reduced by
52Vi per cent. On canned salmon and other
canned goods the reduction of duty Ik 60 per
cent and the aforo is reduced by varying per
crntaires from M to 60 per cent. On windmills
(largely used there) there In a reduction of duty
of M per cent and of aforo 60 per cent. On
dried or evaporated fruits (apples, etc., etc.)
the duty is reduced 60 per cent: on cotton duck
ing, white or colored, the aforo Is reduced
33 1-3 per cent. On sail twine and cotton rope
the duty Is reduced 20 per cent and the aforo
33 1-3 per cent.
On the other hand the Argentine Government
demanded reciprocal concessions on the few ar
ticles she vends to this market. Among these
was wool and American wool growers have ex
pressed fears that this would prove injurious to
the domestic interest.
The total Import of wool Into the United State*
for In9'.< from all countries was 76,673,000 pounds.
Of this from Argentine came only 7,957.000
pounds, which is a very small portion of our
aggregate importation. It appears that our
woolen factories require, notwithstanding high
duties, a certain amount of foreign wool to sup
plement the domestic product. There is no
proposal for any reduction of wool duties in
favor of any other foreign country. It is evi
dent that the proposed reduction of Argentine
wools alone can have no effect on our market
prices. The majority of the wool Is of the
â¢â¢oarsest class (for carpets, etc.), which Is not

This concesaton on Argentine wool was made
not because of Its effect upon our amount of

the free markets of Europe, but becauw it was
one of the only three articles of Argentine ex
port of which reciprocal relations could be
made, and one without which that republic
would not consent to the convention.

PROSPECTS FOR
THE CANAL GOOD
Senator Morpan Speaks
on the Subject.
Special Dlapatch to ThÂ» rail.
WASHINGTON. Dec. -Senator Mor
gan, who as chairman of the Senate
Committee of Intcroccanlc Canals, has
played a most Important part In the agl
tatlon and advocacy of the Nicaragua ca
nal construction In former Congresses, de
clined to express an opinion upon tho
Americanization of the Panama Canal
Company through articles of incorpora
tion granted In New Jersey.
"The Senate committees." he explained.
were announced Just befon; recess and
the committee of which I am chairman
had no meeting. Of course all work, so
far as we are concerned, begins unew
with the new Congress. Several bills
looking to canal construction have been
Introduced, and the of us who hav.j
worked for canal legislation In the pa*t
hope to see substantial steps toward that
end taken by this Congress.
â "The eofflmlwkn trf â whirh Arfnttrat
Walker Is chairman Is about to make .1
personal Inspection of the different
routes. We have been promised the re
port of the former commission of three,
of which Admiral Walker was also chair
man. That former commission was au
thorized to Inspect and make estimates
on the Nicaragua route alone, while thÂ«
one created by the last Congress la to
report on them all. Congress appropri
ated $1,000,000 to defray the expenses of
this work."
Senator Morgan does not understand
that the Maritime Canal Company, which
has heretofore figured as a concessionaire
controlling the Nicaragua route, ac
knowledges Itself to have been supersed
ed, as Indicated by the claims of Mr.
Grace and Mr Eyre In to-day's dis
patches. While the Maritime Company
is making no effort to have Itself men
tioned In the legislation on the subject
before the present Congress. It asserts
that Its concession Is still alive.
It is the opinion of Senators and Rep
resentatives here that there will be no at
tempt to take further steps toward ca
nal legislation until after the Walker
Commission submits Its report on the
different routes, which will not be within
a year.

REFORMS SUGGESTED IN
HIGH SCHOOL TRAINING
Benjamin Ide Wheeler Holds That the Studies
There Should Be Practical Rather Than
Preparatory.
Three of the Officers Elected by the Educators.
SACRAMENTO. Dec. 2S.â The State
Teachers' Association this after
noon heard papers on teachers' in
stitutes, the administration of city
school systems jind California
school laws, and listened to an ad
dress by Benjamin Ide Wheeler on "The
Relation Between the University and the
, Schools." This address was clearly the
feature of the day's session and was re
ceived with â  great deul of Interest by
the association.
President Wheeler took a radical stand
on a number of questions connected with
the subject treated by him and left no
; doubt as to his meaning. He said the
frrowth of attendance at the State Uni
versity had been SoO.per cent In the last
ten years, while the Income had increased
[ but 717 1 per cent. He did not know what
â¢ would be the result If trie attendance kept
on increasing In anything like the pres
ent ratio, and declared that the problem
was a most pt-rious one. In this con
nection he paid a flattering tribute to
California by saying that it seemed to
him likely that California Is gulnc to de
mand a higher education for a larK- t
proportion of her population than any
other State in the Union. One reason he
attributed for this was that there was no
lower class in California, and that all the
people were more or less prosperous.
He expressed the hope that the schools
and the universities would get together
ln a common understanding. There was
not. as many seemed to think, a break
between the high schools and the uni
versities, but the one led naturally Into
the other, and every curriculum adopted
should respect the fact that education is
a continuous thing. The Idea that any
! particular subjects are necessary to be
taught is led or should be based upon
the fact that it is necessary to feed that
! sort of Intellectual food which will en
able the mind to grow. The child's mind
' is peculiarly receptive on the side of the
humanities and myths and stories. Watch
a child as it tries to adjust concepts to
bits of spe.ch and you will see It in the
process of its development into a member

VETERANS ARE OPPOSED
TO CIVIL SERVICE LAWS
Veterans of the Civil War Associa
tion met last night at their head
quarters. 123 Eddy street. In an address
to the members President Martin Murray
stated that It was the intention of the or
ganization to continue the meetings until
the eyes Of every veteran from Califor
nia to Washington are opened to the
hypocrisy of the civil-service law as it
is carried out by the heads of the various
departments. He said that the latest
move of the administration la to keep un
skilled labor under civil service.

In connection With the complaint that
high schools are used as preparatory to
tbo universities, President Wheeler con
ceded the fact und said while he had been
particej - crimlnla in preparing questions
for ex tmination he did not believe in the
plan, but thought the high school should
perform Its function In the education of
the pupil and not with the view to a uni
versity course.
He spoke in favor of the establishment
of various halting places throughout the
entire school course. saying that these
werf nects^ary to enable the student to
ascertain that for which he was best
adapted. In high school work he can de
term!! c at the halting place whether he
will go into college or not. In college he
can determine at the halting place
whether or not he will specialize his work.
President .Wheeler declared against en
trance examinations, saying thoy were a
bad thing. Ixeauso they make the school
dependencies of the colleges and because
the pupil is compelled to cram not for the
purpose of acquiring knowledge of the
eubjf<-t that will benefit him but solely
for the purpose of acquiring knowledge
that will fit him for a test. As the high
school 16 a course In the development of
personality, a culture course. its mission
should not be to get students into the uni
versity. Colleges should accept students
who have taken a high school course and
should arrange matters accordingly. In
this connection he advanced th-; radical
doctrine that It was not undignified in
colleges to teach the eginnlngs of stud
ies. He thought that Greek. German.
French and other stÂ« lea might well be
taught In their beginnings in college, thus
cnabliDg the higher institutions of learn
ing to meet the high schools half way,
and thus weed out from the high school
curriculum mitny studies unnecessary to
the student who docs not Intend taking a
college course. He did not believe that a
college student should be allowed an un
bridled use of the right of election, but
thought he should be compelled to group
his studies with a view to a purpose.

officer Coleraan. obedient to Instruc
tions, went to the otllces of Jake Kauer
last night, where he found Stone and took
him to police headquarters. lie was
closely interrogated us to his connection
with the two tires, and was only allowed
his liberty on promising that he would
' return to the chief's office this morning.
Stone stated yesterday afternoon that
Bibero Maximo, a Filipino who was de
ported by the authorities, set fire to the
Bush-street Theater out of revenge.
Stone claimed that Maximo had, shortly
before leaving for the Philippines, admit
ted to him that ho had urea the build
ing.
Members of the Filipino troupe, who are
now quartered at 75$ Howard street, laugh
at their manager's assertion. A number
of them boldly stated that the colonel was
I crazy and that the charge he makes
against Maximo Is one of his hazy no
i tion*.. They are tired of living In this
, country and express a hope that they
will be shortly sent back to their native
land.
The colonel would not have been Incon
venienced but for a fire that was discov
ered Wednesday afternoon at 510 Jones
street. It was discovered by Brendon
Clark, chief usher at the Alcazar Theater,
who lives at 506 Jones street, and who
turned in an alarm from box 46. He in
, formed Officer Dan Sylvester and also
; Fire Marshal Towe that he had seen
Stone leave the premises five minutes
I before the fire was discovered. Coupled
to his statement was that of Mrs. A. M
Mlkkleson of Berkeley, the owner of the
* building. She Informed the officers that
the Filipinos' manager had threatened to
be revenged on her for being ejected from
the premises for not paying rent. Fire
Marshal Towc has been working on the
case for the past two dayÂ« and will not
permit Stone to leave the city until he has
made a thorough Investigation.
THE NATURE OF MICE.
It Is Somewhat of a Puzzle to the
Human Mind Until You
Understand It
Fpw people understand the mystery of
mice. I think I can, without immodesty,
claim to understand mic>\ for I have
made them a ptudy for many yearn. I
v.âii to think that nature supplied mice
wherever there seemed to be any call for
thÂ«-m. For example, if you live in a house
whin- th<-re B.re n<> mice and in a raah

I tran or set up a cat. mice will immedi
ately make their appearance. To the
, superficial observer this looks as If na
ture, perceiving that you have a mouse
trap. prOceeda ro supply mice for it, or
noticing that you have a cat sends mice
enough to satisfy the animal. But thin
is not the truo explanation. In order to
Understand mice you must prasp the fact
' that the mouse is an animal with a keen
of humor and a love of excitement
Wi'h this key in your possession you can
readily unloon the mystery "f mice.
That thÂ»' mouse has a sense of humor
Is conspicuously shown hy the way in

In the East, said President Wheeler, the
normal schools are attempting to usurp
the functions of a high school. This was
bad, he said, for many reasons. The nor
mal school should, he thought, accept no
pupils except'those who are graduates of
a high school. In this way th.- tone of the
graduating teacher is raised by having a
course In high-school work as well as a
course In pedagogy, and if any time the
pupil felt that ne should attend a college
he could do so upon his high-school cer
tificate.
Harr "Wagner of San Francisco road a
paper on teachers" institutes. in which he
advocated giving full pay in attendance
on these, and that the attendance should
be compulsory; that salaries should be
paid teachers twelve months In a year. In
order that they could devote their vaca
tions to study and healthful recreation;
that the State Normal schools should hold
summer sessions, and that the State Su

have the power to certificate teachers of
institutes.
C. W. Mark of San Francisco, in a pa
per on practical problems in the admin

that a solution of the difficulties would
be brought about by the Introduction or
proper civil service reform.

School read a paper on "The Spirit of
California School Law." in which he ad
vocated changes that would enable teach
ers to be selected on merit alone and
which would give to country schoolteach

SOMETHING ABOUT GIANTS.
Tallest Men of Our Day Compared
With Those of Ancient Times.
Old chroniclers tell wonderful stories of
the giants that used to walk the earth
even as we read in the Bible of Goliath'
who was slain by the young David In
later days perhaps the most Interesting
book on giants was written by a French
scholar named Henrion In 171 S. This hnnir
asserted that Adam, the tint man was m
feet nine inches tall, and that Eve wm
only five feet shorter. After Adam man
began to lose height rapidly. Noah <Â£?â *

Abraham measured not more than 2')

four feet long, and others In pronortinn
Many other similar skeletons wVr found
one in Sicily that measured thirty feet in

It has been shown that these' skeletons

Patrick Cotter O'Brien, who was born at

feet three Inches tall, and was the ere-it

is the skeleton of a giant named Magrath
who was seven feet eight Inches high
It is an interesting fact that giants a's a
rule are both weak of body and of mind
while dwarfs are usually keenwitted and
healthy. A story Is told that the Empress
of Austria in the seventeenth century had
all the giants and dwarfs of the Germanic
empire assembled at Vienna. They were
quartered together, and fear was express
ed that the giants would terrify the
dwarfs. The contrary proved to â¢be the
case. The. dwarfs tormented and robbed
the giants to the extent that with tears
in their eyes the giants begged to be pro
tected from them.
The usual circus and museum giants of
to-day are rarely over seven feet In
height, but they wear high heeled boots
and high hats that add a foot or more in
height to their appearance.â Chicago

the monopoly laughed, then sneered, then began

who had -invested their money In the new
enterprise wer* compelled to gunrantÂ»-e
each i>atron against any loss from any
such source. It may be a Mrnnte coinci

who profeas to !>e exreedlngly timorous about

properties of good manure for keeping tfca
blossoms alive.
At night put the blossoms away In a
cool. dark place; It Is not good, either for
the flowers or the household, that they
should remain In the living, room.
To revive flowers put them into warm
salt water, to which has been added a
few drops of sulphate of ammonia.
To keep a spray cf arranged flowers
fresh place them on damp cotton under
a basin; this keeps the air always moist
and preserves their freshness. It Is espe
cially good for maidenhair fern.

Wife Would Die.
WOMAN MAY YET RECOVER
DOSE OF CARBOLIC ACID FI
NALLY ENDED HIS LIFE.
Injured Woman Says That Crock
well's Father Also Killed His
Wife and Then Com
mitted Suicide.
Special Dl.Â«ratch to The Call.
HALFMOON BAY. Dec. 28-Fred
Crockwell, the farmer who murderously
assaulted his wife at their home In Blen
heim, about six tulles from this place, on
Tuesday morning 1 , died at 2 o'clock this
morning. Mrs. < "ruck well has a chance to
recover.
The trouble was over a small amount of
money Mrs. Crockwell had saved from
the sale'of the farm produce and which
she refused to turn over to her husband. i
Words led to blows. and Crockwell pro- ;
cured a small ax and struck his wife, a
blow on the temple, cutting a deep gash
three inches long. The blow forced the ax
bead from the handle and he struck her
With the handle, knocking her down, and
then rushed into the kitchen, where he ,
secured a marline spike. He returned and ;
again assaulted his wife. Lifting her
from the iloor by the ear. he showered
blow after blow upon her, breaking three
of her ribs en the left side and tearing
away the ear by which he held her. The
weapon flew from his band and out of the j
Window. He left the house to recover It,
and Mrs. Crockwell, although seriously
wounded, escaped to a neighbor's house
and told of the affray.
After the departure of his wife Crock
well went to the barn and drank a portion
of the contents of an eight-ounce bottle of
Carbolic acid. He was found there In an
unconscious condition when the authori
ties arrived and was taken to the house
for medical treatment. He regained con
sciousness later In the day and when told
that his wife was dead said: "I am glad
she Is; i Intended to finish her for good."
Mrs. Crockwell gave the Information
that her husband's father killed his wife |
some twenty-six years ago and then com- I
mitted suicide. i
Crockwell served six months In thÂ«Â»
County Jail here for beating his wife
some eight years aero. The aged couple
were in straightened clrcumstanes. the
products of their little thlrteen-acro farm
belnp the sole source of livelihood. The
property was mort&uged for 51200. They
had no children.
CHINESE MURDERER
EMBRACES CHRISTIANITY
After Conversation With Albert Hoi?
He Decides to Become a Romnn
Catholic.
SAX QIIEXTIN PRISON. Dee. 2S.â No
longer will the great jos3 be invoked by
Ho See, the Chinese murderer of Tuiare,
who will be executed on January 5. Ho
See has embraced Catholicism. And.
strange to say. Albert lion*, the murderer
of Mrs. (lute, Is the moving spirit in the
religious fervor which has placed a veil
between the Chinaman's past and present.
With death staring him In the face the
Bavarian murden-r's thoughts have
turned to the religion of his childhood,
nnd when In his dally hour of exercise h*
met the Chinese homicide the conversa
tion which panned between the two was
chiefly on the subject of the consolations
offered to repentant sinners by the Cath
olic church.
About a week ago Ho See, desiring to
become confirmed in the faith of whose
truth Hoff had convinced him, sent for
Father Sullivan, the spiritual adviser of
California's criminals, who in a few days
will baptize the Oriental.
Ho See Is convicted of a peculiarly
brutal murder, committed early in the
year and on one of his own nation.
Father Sullivan states that he an un
usually bright and Intelligent man. He
shows no trace of fear and will probably
meet hi* death with the phlegmatic In
difference which characterizes his race
If*- will be the tlrst to meet the death
penalty under Warden lire's regime.
Ysabel Molina, the. Bakersflel I murderer,
who will expiate his crime exactly one
week afterward, has also been constantly
attended by Father Sullivan, and the rev
erend gentleman states that the Mexican
feels truly repentant and has confessed
the Justice of the penalty he Is to pay.
Father Sullivan Is greatly interested In
the work of conversion among the prison
ers and Is unceasing in his efforts to
spread the doctrines of his creed among
the tenants of the gloomy pile which con
stitutes San Quentin penitentiary.

COLE WARRANTS
Friends Confident That
He Is Innocent.
Pperl.il Dispatch to The Call.
L.OS ANGELES. Dec. 2S.â The warrant
and other legal documents that have been
pent from Boston for the arrest of former
President Charles 11. Cole, of the wrecked
Globe Bank, who has been under sur
veillance of United States officers during
the week, were to-day expected, but the
wrecking of the Santa Fe train east of
San Bernardino has delayed the delivery
of mall. Should the papers arrive to
morrow. Cole will be formally placed
under arrest and taken before the United
States Commissioner for examination.
Cole does not exhibit a disturbed demean
or, but expresses a willingness to return
to Boston.
Judge Hunsaker. counsel for Cole, dons
not breatho an Intimation as to what
course he will take In behalf of his client,
brushing aside all attempts at Interviews
with the statement that h<Â« will abide his
time until the Eastern documents are
fully examined.
From friends of Cole It Is learned that
there is no contradiction of the fact that
the banker made considerable overloans.
and it Is alleged that a portion of these
were to the copper companies In which
he was Interested, but these friends also
point out that he turned over cash and
securities valued at J1.G00.000. and they as
sort that even at the low value on copper
stocks, under ordinary . circumstances
these would more than cover the over
loans. It Is also indicated that Cole re
ceived what amounted to a clearance, so
far as he was concerned, of the Indebted
ness. There Is every Indication at least
that he will be able to make a strong
legal battle.
Cole's friends do not hesitate to declare
that the failure of the bank was not due
to a shrinkage of the bank's securities,
hut to a lisht made hy the Stumlurd Oii
Company against the Independent copper
companies. In one of which Cole was
largely Interested.

BANKS AS VAMPIRES.
Tmancc
to prove
We asked for an instance in which a bank had
sought j>rofit by the ruin of its debtors, effected by
locking up money to depress prices. In answer the
emergency bond sale by President Cleveland is
quoted. That, however, was a transaction that bears
ro resemblance to the process which the Chronicle
fears banks may indulge in to enrich themselves by
the ruin of tin community. The rapid drain of gold
from the treasury had brought the reserve to the
danger line. Unless it were replenished it was a mat
ter perhaps of hours for the treasury to go broke,
specie payments suspend and the public credit get a
blow that would cripple it indefinitely. Congress
sullenly refused to come to the rescue of the Govern
ment when all the facts were .calmly and frankly laid
before it by the President. It was actuated by the
same stubborn and destructive spirit that is in the
opposition to current measures of financial reform.
The President had no time to appeal to the country,
to advertise bonds for the competition of bidders.
On one side was the immediate prospect of an insol
vent treasury, on the other an ignorant and hostile
Congress. To meet the emergency the contract was
made for gold on the bc*t terms at which the large
amount required could "be had in the short time left
to the President to save the public credit. No
bankers were locking up money to depress the pre
mium on bonds; the Government was a desperate
borrower.
When the last bond i'-sue for the purpose of replen
ishing the gold reserve was made by that administra
tion the President did not wait until an emergency

This opportunity to lock up money, lower prices
and take a cinch out of the Government wat not im
proved, though according to the Chronicle's idea it
â¦vas ju<-t <uch a situation as tempts banks to play
vampire. As no other evidence of such sordid policy
on the part of banks is offered, and this evidence is
inapplicable, we consider the charge withdrawn be

out all other forms of currency in its possession

bills, or should destroy its bills to prevent their cir

SCh|URMAN'S VIEWS.
A recent writer 1. -ed regret that wherever
Russia appears i autocratic government is
.bt under Muscovite do
minion find that they have onlj exchanged Oriental
lental despotism, and that the exotic article
rorse than the indigenous. Americans may find
themselves regretting that our advent into Asia is in
. the aspect of a conqueror, denying to a people the ful
fillment of their dream of republican self-government
This country would have enriched its place in history
if it had respected Aguinaldo's honest devotion to
' the principles of our government and. acting as a
friend instead of a conqueror, it had been the means
of setting up an Asiatic republic, independent and
telf governing, as a new light of Asia to spread re
ican principle* by example. As Mr. Schurman
- the people they have the qualities which
! have made such a government possible. When
he turn" to the religion- aspect of the problem his
%<â¢:â¢> if it indicate* difficulties of the gravest
uature. The millions of Christians in the islands are
people in whose breasts we have apparently
planted the nir:- â ry of harshness and injustice. To
the non-Christian Mahometans only have we gone as
nd. We have recognized and affirmed among
them polygamy and slavery, and instead of killing
them and destroying their property we are paying
their ruler- salaries and agree to protect their reli
and t'nir institutions.
Tl â¢ ins are universally Catholics. After all
it speaks well f<T Spanish policy that, with all its
the people who were brought under it cm
i with fervor and devotion the religion of Spain.
Mr Schurman is very anxious to introduce Pr â â 
antism into the islands as the religion of the new
I the people, but he makes the impo
â¢ n that only one Protestant sect shall enter
that P.eld. because in each of our sectarian div
tl.r people will see only a different and antagoni~t : -
If made a working policy this means that
our civil power shall nominate the Protestant sect
â¢. ho*e keeping shall he put the salvation and
tual interests of the natives. Only the exercise
h power can keep the rival sects from that
rk which each insists upon organizing
and i â  . among distant people-.
Great Britain can do such a thing, and when the
power exists in the Government of the conqueror it
i- undoubtedly a wise policy. When Kitchener de
ed the Dervish power in the Soudan he was
able to stipulate that all Christian missionaries should
â  :luded from the country, and. recognizing Ma
â  :ani<m as the be^t spiritual thought for the pco
he immediately secured an endowment for a
great Mahometan university at Khartoum or Om
durman, in which Islam is to be taught to the people
â¢ power and purity.
But where iiinÂ«-t we go to find authority for our
judge between the sects and, selecting
â  â lie. to repudiate ail others? It i<- easy to >cc that if
<-uch power be asserted, if authority to exclude all
â¢ant sect be found, it necessarily im
plies the right to exclude all. and the Catholic hier
archy will claim, with a strong color of right, that all
should be forbidden to enter, and that our Govern
ment shall introduce there an American priesthood
â¢ill further intrench the church in a field that it
has occupied for three centuries.
It will be seen that wherever we touch the issue of
our conquest the most afflicting problems arise. Their
nature is such that their effects cannot be confined
the inlands themselves, hut they are
immediately n k upon our domestic polity
liridc our own people upon line^ that will se
riously concern the social welfare at home.
If we had chosen another course in the Philippines
id led them in the path of independence and
. ivernmcnt which they longed to follow, all tlie-c
piritnal and civil, would have been left
t" them to solve. The ?trupple for their solution
roold have been in the nature of discipline in gov
ernment.
How idle it i 1i 1 - to talk of devoting ourselves to the
spiritual and civil welfare of ten millions of alieni i
tar away, when in the midst of us arc thirteen millions
<>f nn â  â  M alien race, whose civil rights. J?uar
' -\ by our constitution. are universally disrespected
and whose efF< ritual advancement arc more
commonly the subject of jest and sneer than of help
ful effort and sympathy.
It that what Â«i peoplr will not do at
thrir own doOfl they will not <lo far away.
This is not a harsh judgment of the American
character. It is 'imply rewriting the trtith of our his
â¢<ry We have never anywhere shown the capacity
c fli-pn<;ition to deal fairly with any race hut our
own. The mighty energies which have upraised it.

THE SAN FRAN CISCO CALL. FRIDAY, DECEMBER 29, 1899.
F\ FTER the splendid vote cast for park extension
/ \ on Wednesday it hardly seems needful to urge
upon the attention of voters the importance of
the issues at stake in the elections to-day. Still there
ib always danger that the feeling produced by a
-.\tt;.!iiK victory may incline many of the victors to
become over-sanguine and neglectful of the strength
of the opposition. The men who carried the day for
progress on Wednesday should be sure, therefore, to
ro to the polls to-day and make another victory cer
tain.
As there has been little or no open opposition to
the proposal for issuing bonds for the purpose oi
providing for the completion of a good sewer system,
the construction of a city and county hospital and
the enction of seventeen new schoolhouses.many of
the advocates of progress may regard the result as
already assured and deem it a matter of no moment
whether they go to the polls or not. All such feel-!
ings should be set aside. Even if there were no an
tagonist at all in sight it would still be worth while 1
for every public-spirited citizen to vote in order that
the vote cast for progress may be sufficiently large to
â¢ the widespread popular demand for it.
It is not to be doubted that the various improve
ments contemplated in the issues of the election are
of the highest importance to the community. The
health of the city has been due in the past mainly to
the natural advantages of the locality. As the city
increases in size, however, and the density of the
population becomes greater, the need of an adequate
sewer system becomes more urgent. As for the
schoolhouses it is well known that they are veritable
necessities. We have so far outgrown our school
edifices that at present the deficiency in that provision
for public education has become something of a mu
nicipal disgrace. Much the same can be said of the
proposed city and county hospital. It is a necessity
of the community and should be provided promptly
in the interests of charity and humanity.
Once morr, therefore, the progressive citizens
should go to the polls to cast their votes for a greater
and better San Francisco. They should be resolve-l
to repeat to-day the triumph of Wednesday. We have
begun the forward movement and it should be kept
moving. There should be no slackening of popular
energy jo long as anything remains to be done.
MANKIND GROWING BETTER.
\A AX NORDAU and hi> followers have set
/ \ forth many reasons for their creed that civil
* i/ed man is degenerating mentally, morally
and physically. They have pointed to the grind of
factory labor, to the strain of life in crowded cities
and tv the u-<e of impure foods as conditions which
tend to sap the vitality of the race and render it un
duly nervous, excitable and irritable. As evidences
of this alleged degeneration they assert that men
have been compelled to resort to tea, coffee, liquor-,
tobacco and all sorts of stimulants to fit them for the
intense struggle of life, and that these stimulants in
turn have tended to weaken their nerves and their
mental and moral fiber.
That is the view of the philosopher reasoning upon
<!ata collected from divorce courts, police courts,
prisons and insane asylums. Scientists collecting
their evidence from the records < f the past as well as
of the present, and from the health instead of the dis
ci~r~ of life, have a very different conclusion. From
their studies they draw the verified conviction that
civilized man is improving in every respect and is
better in this age than ever before.
Professor W. J. McGec of the Bureau of Eth
nology, in a recent interview with the Boston Globe,
stated that the teachings of those who believe in the
degeneration of civilized man are without scientific
foundation. Even Paris, he is quoted as saying, the
alleged scat of sensuality, the capital of crime, grows
no worse as the tide of tine sweeps on. And the re
mainder of the world is growing better. The human
race is progressing. Men are growing healthier,
stronger, brainier: they are larger, more fleet of foot
and strong of limb, more quick to think and to do:
they know more, work more, accomplish more and
are better for the life that they lead to-day. Con
trary to a widespread and general impression, they
are less given to the excessive use of liquors and of
tobacco than they once .vere; they are more moral
and more religious.
In stating the evidence upon which these conclu
sions are based, the f>rofeÂ«-or
"One of the best indications of the strength of a
race, all things considered, is the longevity of its
people. Recently there have been exhumed from
the ruins of Pompeii a number of actuaries' tables.
In these the ancient Italian insurance agents had
worked out carefully the expectation of life for the
jP'.ple with whom they did business. When the
Italian actuaries' tables were compared with the
actuaries' tables of the insurance companies now
doing business in the United States it was discovered
that the expectation of life of the American citizen
exceeds by eleven years the expectation of the an
cient Italian. Another impottant factor which must
be considered with the question of the improvement
of mankind is that of stature. It is a fact that the
average American of to-day i< a taller man than the
average founder of this country. By way of com
parison it may be remarked that the American is an
inch taller than the Englishman, while the English
man in turn is an inch taller than the average Con
tinental."
Concerning the oft-repeated criticism of Europeans
that Americans work too hard and live too fast, Pro
fessor McGee said:
"I would lay it down as a general rule that people
on the avenge do what they are able to do, and that
what they actually do is the safest and truest
measure of what they can do. In Berlin the average
man walks at the rate of two and a half miles per
hour; in London, three: in New York, three and a
quarter, and in Chicago. San Francisco and Denver
the latter pace is exceeded. The average length of
life in America exceeds the average in England, and
the proportion of our population that is confine.!
within uylnnu for the insane is considerably less
than in either Fnpland. France or Germany. In this
connection I will -ay that I believe that the greater
amount of labor that the American is able to stand is
due in considerable part to a single cause. The
American is the break la-t eater of the world. He in
variably commences the day with a good meal of
stroncr. steam-producing food. Consequently work is
no drag on him and he can surpass easily in results
the European who commences the day with little but
a roll and a cup of chocolate."
The judgment iriven in favor of a heavy breakfast
may lead to some differences of opinion, but the
general fact? stated by the professor are beyond dis
pute. The world is growing better and the improve
ment has reached its highest mark in the west. The
Califontian rush iÂ«s a sign not of nervous excitement
but of abounding vigor.
Great Britain has found that the effort to take up
the white man's burden in South Africa is a good deal
like trying to take up a redhot stove.

The foregoing list is not absolutely authentic, and is subject to changes
at the last moment: but from observations taken from time to time, and
from conversations had with divers persons supposed to know whereof
they speak, it is candidly believed that the list presents a large number
of winners. Many of them have already intimated that they do not sec
their way clear to refuse the honors about to be thrust upon them, and
are perfectly willing to make a little sacrifice on behalf of the public,
while others will no doubt be surprised at the good fortune which hai
befallen them. D. J. SLOAN 12.

LITTLE SISTERS' SHELTER.
A Number of Youngsters See a Santa
Claus Who Was Behind Time.
There was a happy lot of little chil
dren yesterday afternoon in the Little
Sisters' Infant Shelter on Minna street,
near Sixth, for it was the visit of Santa
Claus to that institution, a little late, it
is true, but the youngsters welcomed old
| Kris Kr â¢ fie Just as much as If he had
' been on time, for he came Into the room
I In which sovonty-five boys and plrls were
' assembled and had something for each.
| It was the ttrst time ln the history of
J that Institution that a Santa < 'lavs In
I the traditional fur-lined clothes and
I sr.ow-whlte whiskers had appeared, and
! all, from thÂ« smallest to the oldest, who
j was under 13 years, were anxiously await
â¢ ing the entrance of the mysterious per-
I t>onape.
There were present the officers and
j about <â â¢â .â¢ of the patronesses of the
i shelter, and for their edilicatlon there was
a phort programme by the children, a few
addresses by the oflicers and -the distri
bution of Rifts to the children from an
j immense troe ln the parlor.
There are now about seventy-five chll
' dren In the shelter, about thirty of the
j number beir.R the little ones of parents
who are forced to be at work during the
day and leave them ni the shelter for
protection and instruction. The others
are steady boarders. Those under a cer
tain axe are taught in the kindergarten,
wlillo tho others are sent to the nearest
public school. Those â¢% no are too young
to be ln the kindergarten re kept In the
nursery. This Institution, which does not

PHILIPPINES
War Secretary Writes
About Hemp.
Special Dispatch to ThÂ« Can.
WASHINGTON, Dec. â .â Assistant Sac
retary Melklejohn of the War Department
has written a letter to Representative
I Long of Kansas defining the policy of the
department regarding the commerce of
the Philippines, with special reference to
the opening of ports for the exportation
of hemp. Mr. Long had transmitted a let
ter of a constituent stating that there Is
so little hemp In the country now that the
price wan 14 to IS cents a pound, as against
a normal price of 5 or 6 cents, while only
2000 bales a week have been shipped to
this country since the war began, instead
of 25,000 bales per week, as formerly.
Premising his explanation with the
statement that General Otis has been in
structed to open the hemp ports as soon
as he had proper garrisons, which should
be early In January, Mr. Meiklejohn goes
on to show that the correspondent has an
erroneous Idea as to the effect of the war
on the hemp shipments. He says that the
largest hemp exportation from the islands
In any one year was in 1597. when the ex
ports averaged 17.300 bales per month.
During thÂ»Â» ten months of 1893 the Imports
of hemp Into the United States amounted
to 46,475 tons, which shows, he odds, that
there never hap been a year when so much
entered the United States as In this year,
while its value has been $41 per ton less
than In I^'.' or IS9I.
Mr. Ifelklejohn indicates that the- cor
â¢ dent pickf d out certain years of ag
rlcultural depression In the wheat Kt.".t'-s
as the basis of his exceedingly low quota
tions of past prices of hemp. He declares
that the communications recelv< l by the
department from manufacturers and brolc
i tr" indicate that there in no trust <â â 
! bine controlling the hemp market, as
feared by the farmers, and he concluded
bis letter as follows:
' Th* War Department Is doing everything
,' compatible with the requirements of the mili
tary situation to develop the trade of the
lElands. and Is confident that the, so-called
hemp ports will be open to trade in ample
time for any accumulation of hemp therein
contained to reach this country and he man
â  factored before the next wi-.Â»at harvest. In
asmuch as the combination at low freight
' rates and hlch prices of fibre will tend to
bring the shipments by steamer In lieu of 6all
inn vesrrlfi. &s they ri-qulre only three months
' for the trip and an additional month will suf
fice to place the article in the hands cf farm-
I ers. shipments leaving Manila In March would
be available for the harvest* in lowa, Ne
braska and other Western States.
CANNERY COMBINE RUMORS.
Story That New Concern Will Start
in Oakland Benied. but Other
Reports Are Afloat.
There was â  story In circulation on the
street yesterday that Frederick Tillmann
Jr. was ;.l<out to build a new cannery In
I d. The basis of this story was that
Mr. Tillmann has purchased land on the
i 'akbmd water front bounded by Wood
and Willow and Twentieth and Twenty
second streets. Mr. Tillmann is a director
in the tanneries combine, and this gave
color to the rumor, for with it traveled
p that the move Indicated a break In
the combine. Mr. Tillmann denied that
there \%.is anything In the story; so did
Mr Pontana, the manager of the com
bined companies. The latt<?r said he had
tood thai the land was purchased
by Mr. Tillmann i-ome time ago. but the
transaction had only Just been put on
recrd. Mr. Tillmann formerly might
have had an intention of building an Inde
nt cannery, but he was not going to
do it.
People Interested In the canneries had
another piece of new â  day to talk
about. Frank Johnson has concluded his
business in the East and stnrteil yester
â  r the coast, but he will stop one day
at Chicago and may not be home before
next Wednesday. What truth there is In
the stories concerning the large condi
tional deal he has made for the purchase
and consolidation of canneries outside of
the combine will then be made known.
Tetters have been received this week In
which the positive assertion was made
that the deal was ready If the terms to be
proposed were patisfactory to the own
ers of the outside concerns.
Artistic Posters That Are Worth
Having.
The poster collecting craze Is Just as
strong as ever. Often high prices have
been paid for those of exceptional merit.
The same also holds true of calendars for
1900; everybody wants one, and the more
artistic it Is the better. The Call in Its
Sunday magazine of December 31 will pre
sent to Its readers a remarkably swell
poster, drawn by Mr. Cahlll and printed
upon heavy paper in specially selected col
or. Further, there will appear a calen
dar for li*W that will b" most artistic and
unique, also in appropriate color, and one
that you will want for the coming year.
Wagon Drivers Fight.
Two wagons collided on Taylor street,
near O'Farrell, yesterday morning and
the drlvr-rs accused each other of rxÂ»ing
to blame. One wagon was driven by Fred
Grath. employed by Max Abrams, a cater
er, and the other by J. Newall, a butcher
< ir.it h struck Newall on the face with
the butt end of his whip, knocking him
down. Newall staggered to his feet and
-:ain knocked down and kicked on
the face. Bystanders interfered and both
men were held nil the police arrived
They were taken to the I a and
charged with battery.

SECRET SERVICE
AGENTS CAPTURE
AN EX-CONVICT
Clever Bunko Game
Blocked.
PRISONER DETAILS HIS PLAN
>
GOADDELLO PRETENBiTD TO BE
A GREAT COUNTERFEITER.
â¦
He Was in the Act of Substituting
Genuine Gold Pieces for Those
of His Own Manufacture
When Caught.
Bltero Goadello, alias Guadello, alias
Lustavo. an ex-convict, was arrested yes
terday by Secret Service Agent Hazen and
Operator Cronin on a charge- of manu
facturing molds for the making of coun
terfeit nve-dollar pieces.
The detection and capture were a clever
bit of detective work. United States
Marshal Shine ascertained that Goadello
was trying to bunko a man named Louis
Zeigler, a pastry cook. He notified tho
special agent and Messrs. Hazen and
Cronin went on the watch. They learned
that Goadello had changed a genuine five
dollar piece last Wednesday at a grocery
on the corner of Hush and Powell streets.
The change was furnished by the driver
of a brewery wagon, from whom the de
tectives afterward received the coin,
which bore the scars of acid. They also
succeeded in tracking Goadello and Zeig
ler to a room on Stockton street and se
creted themselves in a bathroom adjoin
ing that occupied by Zelgler. Through a
hole in the wall they could observe all
that was going on. They saw Goadello
make two molds and when Zelgler stepped
from tho room to get water to cool the
molds Hazen and Cronin ran in with re
volvers leveled and commanded them to
throw up their hands.
Goadello was taken before United States
Commissioner Heacock and held for ex
amination with bonds fixed at $3000. He
admitted to his captors that he was
working a scheme to bunko Zeigler. He
said he had told Zeigler that he possessed
the secret of a metallic composition that
could not be distinguished from gold and
that if Zelgler would advance $200 he,
Goadello, would buy ten pounds of the
composition and make live-dollar pieces
out of it, which they could easily pass,
realizing 12500 out of the speculation. In
order to convince his Intended victim that
he could do as he said Goadello made a
plaster of paris mold In the presence of
Zelgler and When ZeigUr turned his back
to get water to cool the mold Goadello
put the mold into his pocket and sub
stituted one with a real live-dollar piece
in it coated with a preparation of the
color of silver. This piece be held over
a gas Jet and evaporated the silvery sub
stance disclosing a bright gold coin. It
was this piece of money that Goadello
changed at the grocery to assure Zelgler
that he would have no trouble in passing
the coin.
Zelgler will be used as a witness on be
half of the Government.
Oil Company Secures Land.
The directors of the Del Sable Oil Com
pany held a meeting at their office yester
day afternoon and were quite enthusiastic
over their prospects. They have secured
160 acres of land adjoining the Kreyen

The directors hare decided to
dispose of only a limited amount of the

taken up by the present shareholders
themselves. A number of exarrts and

the market. Preparation* have already

Board of Health for new schools, sewers and hospitals to correct the
t prevalence of different diseases in the various districts of the
city should admonish all citizens not to accept the park and panhandle
victory as a foregone conclusion that these measures will be carried to
morrow without their vote.
In Eureka out of IN votes m votes defeated the bond election for new
schools because only 201 voted In favor and li*tf favorable voters did not deem
It r.ecessary to cast their ballot.
There la strong antagonism against the schools and the other sanitary
improvements that must be overcome, so let every progressive citizen be
sura to cast his ballot for these absolute sanitary necessities for our new

Mayor Fears Indifference
"This la no timÂ© to rest." said Mayor
Phelan yesterday. "One great improve
ment has been decided upon, but there is
another battle to be fought Friday. It can
be depended upon that all those who op
pose bonds on general principles, or from
general lack of principles, will be or. hand
to register their kick against progress,
and we must bear in mind that it needs
two progressive voters to overcome the
power In the booth of one opponent.
"The vast majority of the voters are
in favor of all these propositions, and they
should carry by a vote of at least four to
one. The only danger lies in the inclina
tion of so many voters to stay at home
ar.d let the other fellows do their voting
for them. I do not have any Idea that
there will be even as many votes against
schools, sewers and the hospital as there
were against parks, but we should not
take .ny chances, and I hope none will
be taken.
"1 believe that If the campaign In the
Interest of extending the panhandle and
acquiring parks had lasted a week longer
the adverse vote would have been
cut in two. Education was all that was
needed, ai.fi the opposition to the parks
was twice as -â¢â¢at when we started a.- It
was last Wednesday. I cannot conceive
how any worklngman or any merchant
who does business with worklngmen can
commit such n. suicidal act a* to vote
ugalnst bonds."

therance of the bond issues. Every effort
was made to interest contractors an j
builders in the bond issue, and the most
favorable results followed. In many case*
contractors allowed their men ample time
for voting and displayed unwonted zeal in
behalf of the new measure.
F-very Vote U Needed To-Day.
Unless every voter who favors new
schools, sewers and a hospital attends the
polls to-day there la danger that these
very necessary measures may be defeated.
There is a possibility that after the signal
victory yesterday many of the progres
live element will take It for granted that
tho bonds for luxuries having carried,
those for necessaries will certainly go I
through with a more decided majority, and !
will stay at home. It is certain that the i
anti-bondttes will be out In force and will i
try, if possible, to retrieve, In some meas- I
ure, the lost fortunes of Wednesday.
"There can be no solid argument raised
against the propositions to be submitted
to the voters on Friday.*' said Andrea
Sbarboro, "for every dollar means work. ;
There is no land to be acquired, but seve
ral years of work for our worklngmen is
assured If the bonds carry, as I am con-
Bdent they will. No <Â«re doubts the ne
cessity of a new hospital. As the Mayor
has so often said the present structure la
a positive menace to the health of all who
are in it. This one project means over a
quarter of a million dollars for labor
alone. The need of a new and Intelligent
sewer system cannot be doubt, The
building of sewers also means work, and J
the same Is true of the seventeen n*>w ,

The eleven will be in good condition

be a little ragged on account of the lack

substitutes In the line.

MAHER MAY

OVER McCOY
Thus Far the Betting on the
Fight Is at Even
Money.
.Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Dec. 2S.â Although "all
wagers made on the <'"}â¢-. M:> her con
test up to date have been placed at even
money. It is quite probable the Irishman
will enter the ring favorite. This belief
Is due to the fact that several large com
missions have been received by local
sporting men from Westerners, asking
them to place the money on Maher, even
if odds are asked by McCoy men. Joe
Vendlg said to-day that he has a commis
sion of $2500 to place on Peter. George
Consldlne has a commission of J2"00 to bet
â¢n Maher.
"Honest" John Kelly, the well-known
referee and sporting man. has J2SOU he
would like to place on the Irish cham
pion. Kelly believes that Mah^r's great
strength will give him the victory over the
Kid.
George E. Smith, better known as
"PlttsDurg Phil." will visit Maher's quar
ters to-morrow. Smith is a great admirer
of the Irishman, but he has not as yet
placed a bet on Peter against McCoy. He
.-aid that if Ma! â¢ condition la up to the
standard of excellence necessary to win
in a ring contest he would place a large
commission on the Irishman.
"McCoy." said Smith, "is a very shifty
fellow, and, to tell the truth, 1 would
rather see Maher fight Sharkey or Jef
fries than the Kid.
"It Is very hard to hit a man right on
the point of the jaw who is clever with
hi- hands and shifty on his fed and I
think l'eter will have to work hard to get
the winner's share of the pur.Â»e. Still. I
think he will reach McCoy In the course
of the contest, and when he does It will
be all over."

PUBLIC PARK ON
THE SUMMIT OF
TELEGRAPH HILL
Further Destruction to
Be Stopped.
IMPROVEMENT CLUBS ACT
WILL ASK THE CTTY TO BUY
THE PROPERTY.
Ladies of the California Club Take
the Initiative and Are Determined
to Preserve the Old Land
mark.
A united effort Is being made by the
public-spirited men and women of the city
to save Telegraph Hill from further de
struction. Not only are those Interested
In the undertaking determined to preserve
what li left of the hill, but they have In
view a beautiful public park on Its sum
mitâa i>lfusure resort from which the
people may view the Golden Gate, the
bay and the surrounding shores and al.Â«o
get a beautitful panoramic scene of the
city.
Mayor Phelan's address before th<* Cal
ifornia Club on the occasion of Jts re
ception to the teacher* of th<> city Is
what gave birth to the Idea. The Mayor
at that time was making a campaign for
the panhandle and took advantage of the
opportunity to instill a few public im
provement Ideas into his audience. Ms
BUtcgf-stlons bore immediate fruit, for the
ladUs of the civic section of the club
undertook without delay to save Tele
graph Hill. .
Contractors have torn the hill -away
with blasting powder close up to the stone
fence ... surrounds the old observatory.
ThÂ«>ir intention to go still further was
evidenced when they secured an option
on the observatory property, owned by
Charles Sutro. Adjoining this the city
owns four lots. A man named Mac
donald purchased the?-* many years ago
for $10 ."00 and presented them to San
Francisco for a public park. The lots
are there yet. but a long time ago they
were given over to tin rans and the goats
<hat have made the hill famous.
The ladles of the California Club. in
conjunction with the North Beach Im
provement Club, Central Improvement
and the Western Addition Improvement
clubs, have decided tÂ» petition the nÂ«-w
Board of Bbpervlsors to purchase the
two lots adjoining the city's prop
erty 'making a block in all) and Oray
Bros.' option on the observatory prop
erty. In the event of the latter r*>fuslnjr
to sell it has been determined to ask the
authorities to brine condemnation pro
ceeding, or at least a:: injunction suit
to prevent the contractors from further
work toward the destruction of the hill.
A general meeting of those interested in
the matter is to b* h*>M January S. wh*>n
a dennlte campaign will be mapped out.
Following are tho members of the com
mittee appointed to take charge of the
matter and the names of the organiza

SCHOOL CONTRACTORS
WANT THEIR MONEY
THEY FILE CXAIMS AGAINST
THE DEPARTMENT.
Contend That Desks and Other Sup
plies Have Been Distributed
and Used.
Anotlu-r claim for $1400 was filod yoater
daj with the Board of Kducatlon by
W eber A r>>. for tarnples of furni
ture, valued at $6000, which the tlrm fur
oished the School Department a few
months agu. This claim lias never been
paid because the contract wad awarded
â  iry i" Hi- rules of the bourd.
It has been the custom for samples of
goods to remain in the storeroom of the
department so that comparisons could be
made when the supplies were furnished!
The contention in this instance is raised
by the llrm that the desks, etc., furnished
as samples have been distributed among
various schools and have been Used by
the department for some months. The
contractors, believing that they will never
be paid for the original claim of $GUOO.
now present a bill for the samples in the
hope that they will receive at least a part
of hat they regard as due them.
Chairman Holbruok of the finance
committee of the Board of Education
visited Auditor Wells yesterday morning
regarding the payment of other miscel
laneous claims to the amount of |MM>,
which were incurred la Juno of the last
fiscal year and never paid Mr. Holbrook
stated that there would be a surplus of
at least $4000 in the school funds which
might be applied to the payment of these
claims. The Auditor could not see his
way clear to sign the demands as the
law specifically provides that if there is
a surplus in one Jiscal year it must be car
ried over until the next, so the matter
will remain In abeyance.

TARTAR NEARLY
WENT DOWN IN
A BIG CYCLONE
Narrow Escape of the
Transport.
CENTENNIAL IS STILL HELD
RATS ABOARD ARE BEING
HUNTED TO DEATH.
United States Quarantine Officer Kin
youn Afraid That the Rodents
Might Bring the Bubonic
Plague Here.
Three more transports will bo turned
over to their owners in a few days. The
Centennial, Newport and Tar-tar are all
in from the Philippine! and as soon as
they can be examined and their damages
assessed they will cease to be transports.
The Centennial Is still In quarantine.
The bubonic plague scare from Honolulu
has set Quarantine Office Klnyoun guess
ing and he Is not taking any chances.
There is no trace of the disease on the
vessel and, as has been demonstrated,
no likelihood of the plague finding lodg
ment here, but still there are many Ha
waiian rats that have made a home on
the steamer and they have all to be
caught and sacrificed before the vessel
will be allowed to dock.
Hats are said to be the most prolific
means of spreading the plague. ThÂ«
carry the germs from port to port and
in this way the dread disease reaches the
most can-fully guarded harbors. There is
no fear that the ruts on the Centennial
will carry any plague into Ban Francisco,
as every one Of the rodents will be ex
terminated. This operation is expected to
be performed thoroughly by to-day and
the transport will come to the wharf some
time this afternoon.
The Tartar very nearly went to the
bottom with all hands during the voy
age from San Francisco to Manila. When
on the meridian she was caught in a cy
clone that nearly wrecked all her upper
works. Th* after house was stove in,
two of the lifeboats were washed away
and two more were smashed Into kindling
wood; skylights were stove in, cabins
flooded, starboard bulwarks carried away
and the after steering gear smashed. All
In all, the transport had a close call.
The remains of four persons came up
on the Tartar. They were those of James
Williams. Company F, Twenty-eighth In
fantry; Sam Davis, Company Q. and
James Wigs, Company F. Twenty-eighth
Infantry, and Richard Ball, an army
butcher. Two stowaways also came back
on the vessel. They were Frank A. Byrne.
who made his way down on thÂ© George
W. Elder, and Charley Homer, who went
down with Captain Hastings of the Twen
ty-second regiment. Both lads were sent
home by General Otis.
The remains of Lieutenant Keyes came
home on the Newport. There were five
Passengers on the transport. Captain Z.
W. Torrey and F. B. Jones have come
back to America to act as recruiting of
tlcers for the army. Lieutenant Louis R.
Burgess of the Fifth Artillery also came
home. He is on ?lck leave, having been
wounded at Imus.
Mrs. Gallagher in Court.
Mrs. M. A. Gallagher, wife of Attorney
Walter GalTaÃher, appeared yesterday In
Judge Graham's court OH the change of
manslaughter. It belxu charged that she
caused the death of Mrs. Marcella Caleb.
The case was continued till January 3,
pending the result of the Coroner's In
quest.
DE PACHMANN AGAIN
CHARMS HIS AUDITORS
Dn PACHMANN*B second recital at
the California yesterday afternoon
dr<-w another larve audience. It is
not generally considered necessary
that one should soÂ© a musician ai wpl!
~t htm. nnd therefore thf women in
a concert audience take unto themselves
the satisfaction of Ignoring the in^h hat
ordinance and placidly obstruct the vision
of those wh-> arc so unfortunate as to
Fit behind them. This Is not a mntter of
very t;reat moment at most musical enter
tainments, and at some might he account
ed a boon, but one's enjoyment of De
Pachmann Is materially enhanced by a
vlnual observation of his methods. Ills
digital facility Is as interesting as that
of any virtuoso, although his lingering Is
not modern. De Pachmann not being a
disciple of the new pianlsm; It Is rather
the fantastic character of his expression
and pose that attracts and amuses.
De Pachinann'a peculiarities were strik
ingly exemplified yesterday In the Schu
mann G minor Sonata. In the second
movement (andantlno) he wan all rapt
eeatacy. and In the scherzo that followed
the embodiment of Jocose humor. In a
nocturne he dreams. In an etude n* dem
onstrates, and If It were possible he would
dance, to his own playing of a mazurka.
Th<Â» programme began In an unorthodox
manner with Beethoven's melodious "C
Major Sonata, Op. 53." The second Item.
"Seventeen Variations Serialises" (Men
delssohn-Bartholdl), a set of variations
within variations, was Interesting as an
example of musical complexity and came
to a solendid climax In the tlnal *xpres
hlon of the theme. The number was In
terrupted at the thirteenth variation by
untimely applause. I do not think the
unlucky integer had anything to do with
It. but rather the unreason of the, avi
flionco, or a part thereof, which was re
sponsible for a loss of the final" In several
numbers. The American public has not
been educated to applaud with propriety,
and hence w^ find artists compelled to ac
knowledge not only nfter every number
on the programme, but after every move
ment of suite, sonata or symphony. De
Pachmann did not seem satisfied with the
programme, winch he scanned from time
to time, nnd played Chopin's "Etude No.
5" with apparent reluctance.
It wu.s his encore number at the first
rÂ«-< ital and In order that his auditors
should not suffer for the want nf some
thing fresh he inserted the other O flit
"Etude" with marked success. 11.- brought
to the "lfasurka Dp. <." a ?>prlghtliiieÂ«<s
that was Inspiriting. Tho .1 tiK-inK qual
ity could not be more delightfully ren
dered. The sam<- If true of Weber's "In
vitation a la Danse." which ended thÂ»> pro
gramme, but with which he took many
technical liberties. He read Chopin's
"Third Ballade" with much originality
though his use of syncopation was apo
cryphal, but one can forgive I>e Pach
mann much for the sureness of his oh. inn
The last recital will take place this after
iwion at 3:15 o'clock.

2. As a Finance Minister to the President
from ISOI to 1Â«.13.

("ihÂ»-nt In >mi. and ;i?> an
ami Kns!ur,.l
Of these three distinct periods of i
tin's lif..- nil btogTapher, John Austin Sto
vens. says:
By his political life Mr dallatla acquired an
American reputation: by his manaupincnl of
th* finances .if toe l"nlt<Â»d States h<; placed him
self among th* first of political economists of
the day, an.l by his masterly conduct of the
treaty of Ohent he showed himself the e<jual of
the best Kuropean statesmen on their own pe
culiar ground of diplomacy.
A few words as to the life of our states
man before his entrance upon the arena
of national politics. Gallatln was educated
at the University of Geneva, where he
graduated In 1779. In 17S0 he emigrated to
the United States, He engaged In trade
for a fear In Maine, and for two years he
taught the French language in Harvard
AI.BKRT OAI LATIN.
University. In 17*4 he Fettled In Western
Pennsylvania. Here he soon began to tf ke
an Interest In politics, and in IT s *? and 17jsS,
as an anti-Federalist, he opposed the
adoption of the constitution. In 1790 he
was elected to the Pennsylvania Legisla
ture, and in 1793 he was elected, strange
to say, by a Federalist Legislature to the
United States Senate. He served In the
Senate two months, and then by a strict
party vote he was declared to be ineligi
ble and was deprived of his seat on the
ground that at the time of his election he
had been a. citizen of the United States
only eight years, having taken the oath
of allegiance in October, 17SS. In 1794 lie
used his tact and ability and his great in
fluence with the people of Western Penn
sylvania to alloy the whisky insurrection.
He was in sympathy with his Scotch-Irish
constituents as remonstrants and protest
ants against the excise and the Interfer
ence of Government, but he would not
lend them nor follow them as Insurrection
ists.
Gallatin in House of Representatives.
Gallatin took his seat In Congress in
December, 1795, and thus began his nation
al career. He became a follower of Madi
son, the floor leader of the Republican
opposition. He was a ke. n and compe
tent critic of Hamilton's financial policy.
He believed In asserting and maintaining
the power and prerogative of the House
as the dominant popular branch of The
Government, and it was at his suggestion
that the Committee of Ways and Means
was first made a separate committee in
that body.
That which most dlstlngulshesOallntin's
career in the House was his record upaa
Jay's treaty. He was the leader of be
opposition to that treaty and In the course
of the discussion he charged Jay with
having puslllanlmously surrendered the
honor and Interests of his country. The
fierce opposition with which the treaty
was received when its terms were made
known to the public is well known. This
opposition van ably represented In Con
gress. There had yet to be established
the rule and precedent as to the partici
pation of the House In the treaty-making
power. The parliamentary struggle be
gan between the administration an 1 the
popular branch of Congress on March J.
179ti. when President Washington pro
claimed the treaty the law of the land
and communicated it to the House In or
der that ilie necessary appropriations
might be made to carry the treaty It to
effect. Edward Livingston of New York
offered a resolution calling on the Presi
dent for Jay's Instruction** and Other pa
pers relating to the treaty. The flrst of
the two great debates in th" House on the
"British treaty" occurred on this resolu
tion. ThÂ« ditcusslon had little to do with
the merits and demerits of the treaty,
but It dealt with the question whether
the House might rightfully participate !n
giving a .treaty Its effect.
It was understood that the Jay treaty
contained previsions known to he In oppo
sition to the will of the House, whose In
sertion In the treaty had been recom
mended by Hamlltor with the express .le
sign of making laws by the more conven
ient combination of President and Sen
ate Instead of President and Congress.
Gallatin held that the House had a rignt
to prevent tMs and under his leadership
his party majority passed he Livingston
resolution. Washington refused to sub
mit the papers called for and the House
fell back upon a resolution that while It
claimed no agency In the making of
treaties, as a part of Congress It did <-i-|rn
the right cf deliberation and deciding
upon the expediency of carrying Into ef
fect a treaty that dealt with subject*â
like the regulation of commerceâ given by
the constitution to the control of Con
gress. A second great debate arose on this
subject a few weeks later on a Federalist
resolution that the necessary laws should
be passed to carry the treaty Into effect
This discussion touched the merits of and
expediency of the treaty. Gallatln'3 pow
erful arraignment of the treaty called out
two days later the great talents of Fisher
Ames In its defense. Here was a conflict
of great minds In one of the greatest of
Congressional debates.
Oallatln as Secretary of the Treasury.
Before Gallatin left the House he had
become the Republican leader of that
body. and it was largely owlnv to
his talents and leadership that the
JefTcrioiiian Republicans triumphed In
ISW. With the beginning of Jef
fensun s administration in liul Uul
latm became the Secretary of the
lieastry, a position which lit- held COn

iialiutint) jioiay U\ the treasury may bo
summed up in two word*â debt pu>iiiÃ
and tax r. auction, It may be paradoxical
that v nuance minister should expect to
accomplish both these ends at once. l*et
us lea what political si^ninc-ance attaches
â  â  Le . policy and how it was accom
plished. in atudyinn GaJlatin ua a tinan
cicr one is led unavoidably to comparo
him with Hamilton. To the Kepubltcan*
Hamilton was a dangtrou.-* enemy to lib
erty. They charged hlr with looklntf
upon a national debt as v national bless
ing, lhe accusation was not just; but It
was a fact that Hamilton had put tho
I n.ttd Hiates under a good deal of debt,
and Â«_â¢ manifested no great anxiety to
provide for Its Immediate discharge. His
political purpose was to attach to the new
uovernment tho rich and well-to-do, tho
banking and the commercial classes. Ho
eld not feel euro that men would support
the Government unless It was to their
pecuniary Interest to do so. Hut (Jallatln,
representing the lU-publicans. looked upon
a national debt .is a means and bulwark
of corruption. He would lift its burden
from the people as soon as possible and
let them be free to work out their own
destiny and to pursue their own way
without Interference or patronage from
government. He believed that men had
a natural desire to serve the state. Ham

Chicago Grain Market.
CHICAGO. Dec. 2S.â Wheat weakened over
night, opening Me to He under yesterday's
close, at Ctoi^W^c. In the face of the advance
here the previous session at Liverpool showed
a loss. The flour business was reported any
thing but satisfactory, and such crop news as
was favorable was not enough the other way to
buoy up the bull position. The pit was dull
and llftless throughout, the price clinging
around pat figures, a condition which naturally
encouraged some buying. This, with a little
covering by shorts, saved the market from fur
ther lose, even adding a shade to initial figures
toward the end of the season. May closing :Â»c: Â»c
to Uc lower, at 63-Vc.
Corn was rather eteady, especially for May,
this option closing with pome appearance of
firmness. May closed a shade up. at 32 i#32%e.
Oats were lifeless. Prices slipped oft a trifle
but recovervd. May closed a shade up, at 23 sl ,

Provisions were steady, though duller than
yesterday. Small receipts and better prices at
the yards strengthened the market. May pork

The story of her mntrlmonial experience
with Samut 1 Pag* 1 in stranger than fiction,
as it was related thif ufu-rnoon by hcr
â elf.
â  '"Samud Pago was an eccentric rancher,
j,pÂ«<l 75 yÂ«afÃ, who possessed peculiar re

We were married last February by Jus

STONE HIGH SCHOOL
MAY BE DEMANDED
BBRKBLBT, Dee, tt.â With the pur
chase of ;i new site f.. r a High School
building by the BoarU of Kducation hn.s
arisen the Question as to whether or not
the new structure shall be ere, ted of
wood or of stone.
It seems likely that the members of
the board, having to face an already too
large deficit in the School Department
finances, will be inclined to publish bids
for the putting up of a wooden building.
Should that course be adopted several of
the prominent residents of the town have
expressed themselves as ready to oppose
I such a move. They are prepared to In
sist that the needs of the community re
quire a stone structure modeled after the
new high school buildings which are go-
Ing up In different cities throughout the
State. They urge. that a wooden building
would have to do service for many years
and before long would be out of date.
Should the board Insist upon Its present
intention it will doubtless be met with
I visforous protests and petitions from alt
Bides.

properly fed or sheltered. Jerry Phelps.
an old horse trainer, expr-Â«srd similar
opinions. Mr. Phelps explained carefully
that he was the man who had taught Mr.
Nusl>aumer t.. ride in the early daya
when Mr. Nusbaumer's father owned most
of the country around what is now Plea.s
anton and the "Nusbaumer" Indians
wen in that locality.
"I used to borrow all the horm I
wanted from hiÂ» father." paid Jerry with
a wave of his hand toward Mr. Nusbau
mer. "In those days we used to feed them
or. nsphiiltum hay." Further arguments
upon this brand of hay wÂ«-re postponed
until the session resumed its ordinary so
briety.
When C. A. Harlow. the bookkeeper for
Anson Barstow, said that a bale of hay
had been delivered to the horse on No
vember 24 and another on December 25
Mr. Nusbaumer and his confrere. Hart
North, wanted a dismissal. Judge Smith
wanted some more testimony upon the
Question of shelter and Supervisor W. H.
Church was moved up In support of the
Woolsey position.
"I was a farmer," said Mr. Church,
"and we always turned horses out to pas
ture without shelter." City Veterinarian
Pierce thought that the shelter was suf
ficient and that the horse was In better
health than when it was turned out. John
M. English, one of the "Ole Bills," said
the .me thing and then General Wool-
Bey delivered a broadside himself.
"A horse that Is out at pasture will not
go in a shed. They will not even stay
under a tree and artists know this, for In
all the great animal pictures a horse Is
always out In the open, even In a storm.
I had a shed on that lot once, but It wa.
I toJen, board by board, by boy.s. When I
pot this telephone message, I'll tell It
mildly. Mr. Kennedy said that he would
go and see the horse. He had not seen
it yet; and I'll swear thatâ well, three
or four times over."
Dr. /Woolsey put the safety valve on
hard. "He Bald that the horse had some
thing the matter with his kidneys and
when I asked him If he was a kidney
doctor he Bald he wasn't, but he was bred
in old Kentucky. He came around and
.-.ii.i that I would better Join the society,
and 1 opened the door and saidâ well, 1
bald, 'Not on your life' "
The safety valve was put on for a mo
ment, but the explosion came.
"That was only blackmail, mid he knew
It. ' said Dr. Woolsey.
"Defendant discharged," said Judge
Smith, and Generals WOOlaey and Nu.-
baumer had captured the works.

Peculiar Tale of a

ALAMEDA. Dec. 28.â A peculiar hold-up
story was reported to the police last night

Kaufman claims that he was on horse

point near the water tank that stands at
the junction of Pacific avenue and Web

Kaufman refused the. request, and tbe
man commanded him to throw up his
nai/!s, at the ham.- time giving a short,
sharp whistle, Immediately two other
men pprnnc-fraro thoir-hkUng jHaie.i nrrrl
the three attempted to surround Kaufman,
who says he endeavored to ride over the
footpad*, but his horse was tripped by a
number of wires that the highwaymen
had placed across the roadway.
The horse was thrown completely off Its
feet and the rider landed several feet off
In the roadway. The animal, however, re
covered his equilibrium and Kaufman
managed to remount him and ride away
before the desperadoes could harm him.
Kaufman bears no marks to show that
he was in an;' way scratched or Injured
In his fall, and says the robbers did not
attempt to shoot him or the horse, but is
persistent In his statement that the trio
meant to rob him. Police Officer Ladrence
was Immediately sent to Investigate the
matter, but could find no traces of the
footpads, nor was there any evidence to
show that wires had been stretched across
the road where Kaufman says they were.
The police place little credence" In the
story. Kaufman, however, declares his
story to be true and describes the three
men In detail Two of them were tall and
wore slouch hats pulled down over their
eyes. The other was of medium build
and wore a white shirt. He had no coat
on.

FOR TWO YEARS
A WIFE FEARED
BEING MURDERED
Hammond West Sent
to an Asylum.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, Dec. 2S.
Hammond West, the carpenter who.
after bidding his wife and Bister good-by
yesterday, secured his brother-in-law:*
gun, intending to commit suicide, and who
was afterward accidentally shot during
a struggle In which the brother-in-law,
Clark Watson, tried to disarm him, was
committed to tho Insane asylum at Ag
news to-day by Superior Judge Ogden.
West's constitution and ability to with
stand pain proved marvelous. Last night,
while he was lying on a cot In the Re
ceiving Hospital, he tried to tear open the
two ugly wounds on his breast which the
doctors had sewed up; and the charge
made by his wife that he has been insane
for some months proved true. Ha ex
pressed fear to sleep In a room without a
light, and it developed at the examination
to-day before the 1-unacy Commissioners
that he had several times threatened to
kill his wife and ten children and then
himself.
West admitted that he had made tho
threats against life and of self-destruc
tion, but claimed he was only talking dur
ing fits of nervous prostration. It ap
pears that two years ago he experienced
a heavy fall, since which time his actions
have not i>Â»-Â»n those of a sane man.
Mrs. Weal testified that during the past
two years she has been living in constant
fear of being killed. At night the husband
would keep the family awake by walk-
Ing the floor, bemoaning his misfortune,
and though sickness had made him weak
he would frequently go down into the cel
lar and saw wood all night.
He seemed quite calm to-day, and not
withstanding his serious wound he looked
better than for some time past and
seemed resolved to take his fate philo
sophically. The doctors believe that with
proper treatment West's reason may be
restored.

An Acquaintance of Irving'g.
Sir Henry Irving, says the St. Louis Re
public, once told a coterie of friends the
following story:
â When ouite a young man he made the
acquaintance of a certain Joe Robins, who i
had left a good business becar.se he liked '
the stage. He never became â  great actor,
and would undoubtedly have found him- '
self in want now and then if he had not
had his savings to rely upon. Hefore he
made the leap from an orderly existence
into Bohemianlsm he supplied himself
with plenty of clothes, which supply soon
became scattered among his friends, who
were always borrowing from his surplus.
On i day. shortly before Christmas, he had
a part in the annual pantomime, and
dressed himself, with his colleagues, in
the common dressing room. A young fel
low attracted his attention. The young
man siiivered with cold, for he had no
shirt to protect him.
A few days afterward Joe invited his
friends to a little Christmas spread. All
wnom he had invited appeared, glad to
get a good, warm meal at somebody's ex

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway. Dec. .â¢
The foregoing telegram, which was sent
to-day, is a pood index of the sentiment
of the people of Oakland. The success of
the bond election in San Francisco la
taken by the business men of Oakland to
be a forerunner of a similar success In
this city. As the time fur calling the elec
tion draws near enthusiasm over tha
bonds increases, and it now appears that,
unless too many Improvements are ut
tempted. the bonds can rnÂ»tly be carried.
It Hccms to be the prevailing sentiment
among all classes of people that now n
the time for civic progress, and the num
ber of improvements suggested, which uUI
assist the poor man and furnish â¢:mploy.
merit. makes th' bond proposition a popu
lar one.
One of the principal Improvements sug
gested Is tho construction of an Intercept
ing sewer, at a coat of about $430,000. aii<l
a new City 1 1. ill, new wharves and school
houses are also favored. In speaking of
the matter to-day. Mayor It. W. Snow, an
enthusiastic Bupporttr of the bond propo
sition, Â»aid:
"The success achieved by San Franclnco
will certainly help th bond election h-.Tf.
We have not dared to face tho prejudice
of a few by advocating a park bond elec
tion first, but we will soon be re* to
vote for sewers, schoolhouses. commercial
facilities and better streets. We will kÂ»Â»ep
up the. hunt for municipal water and buy
It when ire find It. A park system for
Oakland Is sure to follow. I de3lre to con
gratulate Mayor Phelan. the press, the
Improvement clubs and every progressive
ctllzen of San Francisco upon the sueces*
of yesterday, and we may also congratu
late ourselves. The vote for progress In
San Francisco is the lull of years of
courage on the part of a few, and we bavo
Just such men in Oakland."
Mayor Snow I* not th.Â» only one who !s
encouraged by the San Francisco elec
tion. The members of the City Council,
A. S. McDonald. E. C. Sessions. It. H.
Chamberlain. City Auditor Ureed, Assist
ant City Attorney Condon. John Conant.
E. A. Heron. W. G. Hcnshaw and V.'. W.
Garthwalte have all expressed themselves
in a similar strain, and all seemed highly
pleased at San Francisco's success.

pense. Among them was the shivering
young fellow. As he entered his hoas
called him aside and took him to his bed*
room.
Silently Mr. Robins pointed to some new
underwear and a suit of clothes on the
bed.
Just what this young fellow ate after
he had donned the new^and comfortable
clothes he probably never knew, for ho
had not been so well treated in many
moons.
"You seem to sympathize with the
young fellow. Sir Henry," remarked onÂ«
of the actor's friends, when the latter had
finished his story.
"I do." answered Irving with a hearty
â mile, "for I was th. -hlvertng young fel
low In the pantomime."

developments showed that he and his
companions boarded a freight train short
ly after the commission of the murder,
intending t<i pet out of the county. Not
withstanding thai an excellent descrip
tion of Haywonh was ser.t to every Chief
â¢if Police in the United States the mur
derer managed to avoid arrest.
About a month ago, after he had about
riven up all hop.- of ever ratchlnir Hay
worth. Sheriff Abbott received word that
his man was in Sacramento. He at onca
communicated with the. San Francisco
police. Informing th^m that Hayworth
was badly wanted and asking them to
send nn efflrrr there to arrest him. De
tective Fitzgerald was dispatched to the
capital city, but by the time he reached
there Hayworth had flown. From .i ]â â¢ -
liable source, however, Fitzgerald learned
that the much-wanted murderer, after
leaving; Sacramento, traveled by easy
stages to this city.
Sheriff Abbott, after satisfying himself
that he was on the track of Hayworth,
also came here. Intending to spare no ef
fort in running the murderer to earth.
Through the Instrumentality of the Ills
sion detective Abbott located Hayworth
!n a gypsy camp on the Ban Bruno road.
He contided to one of the gypsies that he
had murdered a man In Utah and thought
that the police wore on his track. Fitz
gerald and the Utah Sheriff lost no time
in visiting the camp, but wore disappoint
ed in not finding their man. H. had be
come suspicious of the actions of the
gypsy band and skipped out under cover
of darkness.
From another source Fitzgerald learned
that Hayworth was heading for Oregon
and would probably stop at The Dalles.
Satisfied that the Information was eor
r.'Ct Sheriff Abb took the first train for
Oregon. While at The Dalles looking for
the murderer he received a telegram from
Fitzgerald saying that Hayworth was
working in a lumber camp on the Hood
River.
The Sheriff nt ence went to the camp
and. reenpnizlng the man for whom he
had traveled hundreds of miles, started to
place him under arrest. worth
leached for his revolver, but before he
could shoot he was seized and hand
cuffed.
Ahl-ott will leave for Utah to-day ac- !
companied by his prisoner.
Now that Hayworth has been safely I
landed In Jail Sheriff Abbott thinks he
will have little trouble in locating Steph
ens and Reavls. The latter is supposed
to be in this State working as a farm
hand.
For his cleverness In locating the mueh
wanted murderer Detective Fitzgerald

Finance Committee

MINORITY MEMBERS IGNORED
The Incoming Board of Supervisors held
an open caucus last night in the board
rooms at the City Hall and elected Super
visor Thomas Jennings chairman of the
Finance Committee and Supervisors
Tobln and (totaling as his coworkers in
that body. Victor Duboee, the nominee of
tho minority, was turned down cold and
got only the three Republican votes. The
creation of the remaining committees was
delegated to Mayor Phelan and he, in
accepting the charge, said he would make
known his selections at the first regular
meeting of the board on January 8.
The little business transacted had been
programmed before the meeting opened
ana went through without bitch. The
board oisplayed a gratifying unanimity
and an enthusiasm which called forth the
heartiest commendation of the Mayor,
who was called upon to open the meet
ing. This lie did with a snort outline of
what the duties of the board under the
charter were to be. In mentioning the
numerous committees, he Bald the License
and Order Committee would have consid
erable work before It, as the charter re
mitted the license now charged upon tho
merchants and a deficiency of $ltÂ«,OOu per
annum would result. He suggested mat
there. were many ways of making that
amount up and even Increasing the rev
enue of the city from licenses and that ft
would devolve upon the committee to de
vise .ways, and means to that end. 11.
also said that a Civil Service Committee
should be created and further that, in his
opinion, every department In the city gov
ernment should be represented by a com
mittee on the Hoard of Supervisors.
* Mayor" Phelan gave way to Dr. d'An
cona, who was elected chairman of the
meeting. James IV Booth "was made tem
porary secretary. Supervisor Tobln sug
gested that the selection of the Finance
Committee be made, IK> placed Thomas
Jennings' name before the board. There
were no other nominations and the secre
tary cast the ballot. Supervisors Hotting
and Tobin were then named. Supervisor
Sanderson nominated Colonel Duboee as
the minority candidate. In doing so he
made a demand for minority recognition
and stated that the charter Use); was
pregnant with the spirit of non-partisan
ship and thai it was the custom of all
legislative bodies to grant the recognition
he demanded. The vote gave Ilotallntr 18
T< i. in 13 and Duboce 3. *
A discussion of committees followed and
in speaking of a committee on Improve*
mer.ts of streets and the water front,
which was suggested by Supervisor
O'Connor.- the Mayor said that the State
at present had control of the harbor
front, but that the merchants had al
ready started a movement looking to the
reinvestment of the city with that" prop
erty. He said It was the policy of the
party to bring that consummation about.
Adjournment was taken to 2 o'clock on
the afternoon of January S.
GAGE HAS DECIDED TO
CALL EXTRA SESSION
Proclamation to Be Issued Early
in January.
Arrangements to Be Perfected To-Day at
a Conference to be Held in
Sacramento.
GOVERNOR GAGE has resolved to
call an extra session of the Lcgls
lature. He was In the city last
Wednesday, and while In town
conferred with politicians of the
Burns and Herrln ' following.
Shortly after his return to the capital
he wired to several men a message re
questing them to meet members of the
Legislature, at Sacramento on December
29. â¢to discuss men and measures re
specting expenditure on the mother
lode."
it a words "mother lode" In the Gover
nor's telegram probably signify "extra
session of the Legislature." The trustees
and officers of the State Mining Bureau
are not apprised of any immediate de
sign upon the part of the Governor or
the bureau to exploit the mother lode.
Possibly topics connected with mining
may be discussed in a . era! way.
Lieutenant Governor Jacob Neff receiv
ed one of these notices from the Gover
nor, but it did not state where the meet
ing was to take place. On Wednesday
Mr. Neff heard that the Governor was at
the Palace and hurried there to see him.
A long conference ensued, but when seen
later Mr. Neff declined to say what topics
were most discussed, although he admit- :
ted to two members of the Assembly that
the extra session proposition had entered
largely into the conversation. Mr. Neff,
It Is said, will go to Sacramento this I
morning.
The Legislature at the last regular ses
sion placed in the general appropriation
bill, contrary to the constitution, a pro
vision authorizing the Governor to ap
point mining experts to survey the
mother lode, but the legislation has no '
force or effect, because the subject mat
ter was not expressed In the title of the
bill. Furthermore, it was provided that
the Governor should nx the compensa
tion of the experts, and no reference j
: thereto was made In the title.
The Inference can be readily drawn that
the suggestion of mining expenditure! Is
; a clumsy blind to conceal the real de
sign of the proposed conference at Sacra
mento to-day.
The Call's information derived from va
rious sources leads to the belief that the :
proclamation convening the extra session
will be Issued next month. It has been
represented to the Governor that public
i Interests demanded that the Senatorial
question shall be eliminated from State
politics before the agitation begins for
the selection of delegates to the National
Republican Convention. It Is contended
that California will have two State con
vent lons for each political party in the
year 1900. The first Republican conven
tion will probably assemble In May to
elect delegates to the national convention
at Philadelphia. it is also claimed that
candidates for Presidential electors and
members of Congress must be chosen un
der the provisions of the primary elec
tion law, as provision Is made In the Po
litical Code of California for the election
of such officers. A primary election can
not be held under the law before August
2, hence the second Republican State con
vention cannot assemble until the latter
part of August or early in September.
No extra expense, however, will be re
quired, as the primary election must bo
helil on Annum 2 to elect delegate* to a
convention to nominate Judicial officers
and members of the Legislature.
In view of the Impending political agi
tation In April, springing from the crea
1 tion of local conventions, to elect dele
gates to a State convention In May. the
advocates of an extra session contend
that the Governor should either appoint a
Senator or convene the Legislature to
elect one without further delay.
POODLE DOG MEETING
A REGRETTABLE ERROR
County Organization Takes Up the
Question of Patronage in
Executive Session.
A special meeting of the Republican
County Committee was held in the Shiels
building last night. Chairman Alfred Itou
vler presiding for the purpose of rÂ»- -elv
inÃ the report of the sub-committeo ap
pointed to investigate the conduct of the
recent municipal campaign. The report was
a complete vindication of the party man
agers, so far us their honesty of purpose
was concerned, in connection with the
much-discussed conference in the old Poo
dle Dor restaurant, declaring that that
conference had been arranged only after
deliberate confederation and consultation
with men of the highest standing in the
party. Continuing, the report says:
"It is believed that this unfortunate
affair was a serious mistake on the part
of the management, but that while disas
trous to the interests of the party. If was
committed under circumstances that were
extenuating and which certainly rendered
it pardonable. The meeting in the Poodle
Dog was undoubtedly planned for the pur
pose of trapping prominent representa
tives of the Republican party, and the
scheme was laid by adepts In the art of
political intrigue, who counted, not un
wisely, on the inexperience of those whose
assent was necessary to bring the matter
to a successful culmination."
In conclusion the report recommended
that the management be commended for
the earnest and energy with which It
had conducted the campaign and that the
incident of the conference be considered
closed. The report was adopted without
objection and the committee then went
into executive session. By a vote of 26 to
17 '/.. U. Dodge was invited to attend the
executive session and all future executive
sessions of the committee.
Chairman Alfred Bouvler and Secretary
J. E. Wilson, who had been appointed
a special committee to interview the Re
publican office-holders on the subject of
appointments, reported that Sherir
Lackmanp had agreed to recognize the or
ganization in making his appointments;
that County Clerk Deane was not pre
pared to declare his intentions; that Aud
itor Wells did not contemplate any
changes in his. office force, but would
recognize the organization in the matter
of extra clerk hire, and that J. 11. Scott,
Tax Collector-elect, had signified his in
tention to apportion his appointments as
far as possible among the various districts
without pledging himself to accept the
recommendations of the organization.
Several of the commltteemen announced
that Scott had refused to listen to their
claims, and that he showed an inclina
tion to Ignore .the organisation. It was
finally decided to invite I.ncktnani. Wells.
Deane and Scott to meet with the com
mittee next Tuesday night and Inform It
as to their Intentions. An adjournment
until that date was then taken.
In the Divorce Court.
Decrees of divorce have been granted
Downing W. Graves from Alice A.
Graves on the ground of extreme cruelty,
and John C. Hayes from Lizzie Hayes
fordcsertlon. Suits for divorce have been
filed by Joseph Ttothkopf against Albert
8. Bi thkopf for cruelty. Theresa S. S!m*
against Edward V Sims for cruelty, and
Manuel D. Rczendes against Maria L.
Rezendes for desertion.

Died While Praying.
Miss Julia Cummerford, a seamstress,
aged C 3 years, died yesterday evening at
her home. 71" Natoma street. The lady
had complained of heart trouble for BOOM
time, and last evening was on her knees
saying her prayers with her sister, when
she became seriously ill. and expired a
short time afterward. The cause of death
i* supposed to have been heart disease.

cret was let out at a recent conference 'Â»â¢.<>
had with the Governor. Mr. Sonntag says
that he, personally, has no Interest In tliÂ»Â»
Senatorial fight, and that his desire to
have an extra session called Is solely fir
the purpose of benefiting the water front.
M l am almost positive that an extra ses

said Mr. Sonntag last night. "My In

close to the Governor, and I believe that
It can be relied upon. The necessity of
Improving the water front will he the
basis for the call. The Governor Is con
vinced that lone action In that direction
Is Imperative and that It will be of benefit
to the whole State. Consequently he feels
that It Is his duty to convene thÂ«* Legisla
