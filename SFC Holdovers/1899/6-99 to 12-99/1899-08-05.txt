THAT SOUTH AMERICAN
ALLIANCE IS DOUBTED
The Presidents of Argentina and Uraguay, Who Are Said to Be
Planning to Unite Their States With Chili and Brazil in an
Alliance Against the United States as an Offset to the Im
perialistic Policy of the Latter.
WASHINGTON*. Aug. 4.â There is no anxiety among officials at the State Department over the report that
South American republics may form an alliance against the United States. The rumors are said to be of
English. Italian and Spanish origin and inspired by traders of those countries for the purpose of influ
encing trade. The wish is father to the thought, but the State Department has the best of assurances
Â«f South American friendship and has no fear of an alliance against this country.
It Is true that f. -r Borne years there has been an unfriendly feeling inChile and Argentine, which is easily
explained and quite natural. President Harrison had to give < "hile a lesson in manners, and Argentine is controlled
by British and Italians, who think they are our rivals. But the feeling in these countries is growing better, and it
has no Influence upon other South American republics. An official of the State Department whose business it is
to keep posted on Smith American affairs and conditions said to-day concerning tho reported alliance:
â¢You can rely upon it there Is nothing serious in it. It is an old rumor revived* We had it when President
Cleveland Bent the Venezuela message to Congress. "We had it again when the protocol was signed for the suspen
sion of hostilities with Spain, and now we have it because of some fancied supposition that we intend to get hold
of .Fan Domingo. It is the British, Italians, Spanish and Germans in South America who are raising the cry for
commercial purposes. I have read all the South American papers closely and cannot find that such sentiments by
South Americans have really any existence among them. I see President Roca of Argentine intends to visit Brazil
and presumably will solicit Brazil to enter the alliance which he is- projecting. It is inconceivable that Brazil should
give any heed to such a movement. Brazil has always been on terms of greatest friendship with us, and for good
MANCHESTER. Mass., Aug. 4. â Senor Aspiroz. Mexican Embassador to the United States, who is spending
the summer here 'was much interested in the dispatches which reported the departure of President Roca of
the \rgentine Republic with the Minister of Foreign Affairs and thirty Senators from Buenos Ayres for Brazil.
Senor Aspiroz said he had not learned of such a movement. He gave it as his. opinion there could be no founda
tion in fact for the report that an alliance was contemplated between the South American republics against the
United States and to bear him out in his opinion referred to the movement started by Brazil, with a contribution
of $250 000 for' the purpose of establishing a steamer line between that country and the United States, Nicaragua
and "Honduras, he asserted, intended to contract an alliance between themselves, but the Embassador holds that
to be insignificant.

WILL SOON PROCLAIM
HIMSELF PRESIDENT
Jiminez Says He Is All Ready for the
Invasion of San Domingo,
Expects That After Landing on the Island With
a Party of Weil-Armed Americans the
People Will Flock to His Standard.
Special Cable to The Call and New York Herald. Copyrighted, 1899, by
James Gordon Bennett.
HAVANA, Aug. 4.â ln an interview
,v Jiminez stated that two of the
men who were connected with the as
sassination of President Heureaux of
San Domingo were confidential agents
of his. They were also in the good
s of Heureaux, who had deputed
them to assassinate Jiminez. They
Informed Jiminez's friends of the plot
and a counterplot was successfully or
ganized by them for the assassination
of Heureaux.
Jiminez displayed a cipher cablegram
which he received from an agent in
San Domingo this morning which reads
a<= follows:
"Revolution commences to-day in
Da.iabon. Send definite answer when
you will arrive. Must be as early as
possible. FRANCO."
Jiminez has replied: "Be there by
last of monjh with party. Delay so
as to avoid bloodshed. Think present
Government will retire before then."
Jiminez declared that he has 30,000
stands of arms in Cuba ready to be
used, and part of the filibusters in the
United States are prepared to sail at
once.
Wh^n asked if he did not think the
T'nited States would stop his expedi
tion, he smiled and said: "Has the
T'nited States enough vessels to guard
the entire coast of Cuba and the Isle
of Pines that can be spared? Never
fear; we will have no trouble in sail
ing, and we will sail soon."
Jiminez is said to be backed by Go
mez and other prominent Cuban army
officers, i. -. plan is to land a party of
Americans on the coast with a Quantity
of arms and ammunition, and then
proclaim himself President. He ex
pects that the people will flock to his
standard.
WARSHIPS TO WATCH
FOR THE FILIBUSTERS
WASHINGTON, Aug. 4. â Affairs
continue quiot in San Domingo, ac
cording to all official advices receiver!
here. A dispatch to the Navy Depart-
SAN FRANCISCO, SATURDAY, AUGUST 5, 1899.
I ment announced the arrival of the
New Orleans at San Pomlngo. Her
â¢< ommanding officer found no change in
; the situation. The New < >neans will
\ remain at San Domingo City, while
j the Machias will make a tour of the
! island, putting in at principal ports.
The policy will be to keep warships
in the waters of San Dom'.ngo and
Hayti for some time to come, though
it is probable that a smaller vessel
than the New Orleans or Machias will
be assigned to this duty.
The authorities place little credence
in the boasts of Jiminez that he is
coming to the United States to fit out
an expedition against the Government
of San Domingo. If he really contem
plated anything of the sort, they as
sume that he would not let the public
know of his intentions..
As a precautionary measure, how
ever, the authorities in Cuba have been
directed to keep watch on his move
ments, and naval vessels in Do
minican waters will be on the lookout
for any filibustering expeditions.

Sensational Theory of M.
Del Casse's Mission to

WANTS tTaBDICATE
It Is Said That Nicholas Has De
cided to Retire on the Occa
sion of His Visit to
Darmstadt.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
r^T. PETERSBURG, Aug. 4.
M. del Casse, French Minis
ter of Foreign Ait airs, ar
rived heir to-day from Paris to re
turn the recent visit of Count Mu
ravieff, Russian Minister of For
eign Affairs. This afternoon he
was received by Count Muravieff,
with whom he will dine to-morrow.
Count Louis dc Mountbclle,
French Flmbassador to Russia, will
return the honor Sunday. M. del
Cassc will remain in St. Peters
burg.
LONDON, Aug. 5.âM. de Blo
witz, the Paris correspondent of the
Times, gives an extraordinary cx
\ planation of M. del Casse's present
mission. He asserts that it was de
cided upon quite suddenly "for a
reason which admitted of no de
lay," and then gives the story,
which says he lias it from "a source
â  to which 1 am bound to attach im
' portancc."
This is the explanation: "Em
peror Nicholas is disappointed and
tired of the thro.ne. The absence of
an heir excites his superstitious
feeling and he connects himself
7K-itli a Russian legend, according to
which an heirless Czar is to be suc
ceeded by a Czar Michael, predes
tined to occupy Constantinople. The
death of the Czarozvich and the
failure of the conference at The
Hague led him to decide to abdicate
on the occasion of his coming visit
to Darmstadt. On this becoming
kno7vn in Paris M. del Casse was
sent in hot haste to dissuade him
from carrying out this intention."
DRYBROUGH, THE
POLO-PLAYER, KILLED
LONDON. Aug. 4.â J. W. Drybrough,
one of the b '. polo players in England,
died this morning as the result of an ac
cident yesterday during a polo tourna
ment at Rugby. He had been playing in
the semi-final game only a few minutes
when he and an American named Mackey
collided. Both ponies fell and rolled over.
Mr. Mackey was unhurt, but Drybrough's
skull was fractured and he expired to
day without having recovered conscious
ness.
Mr. Mackry is a native of Wisconsin.
He was formerly a member of the Chi
cago Board of Trade and has been living
near Leamington for a number of years.
He is well known in hunting and polo
circles.

ROOT FAVORS SENDING
OUT A LARGER FORCE
New War Secretary Believes More Troops
Are Needed in the Philippines.
When the Campaign Is Resumed in the Fall Gen
eral Lawton Will Have Charge of the
Active Military Operations.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, WEL
LINGTON HOTEL, WASHINGTON,
Aug. 4.â Secretary Root's short expe
rience in the War Department has al
ready convinced him that the views of
military commanders, subordinate to
General Otis, who favor a larger mili
tary force than recommended by that
officer, are worthy of serious considera
tion. There are reasons to believe he
will recommend that the force be fur
ther augmented.
Secretary Root and General Corbin
will visit Lake Champlain on August
12 to remain several days, and the
whole Philippine situation will be thor
oughly discussed with the President.
I understand the plan of operations
for the fall campaign contemplates the
division of the islands into several mil
itary departments, and General Law
ton will have command of the one in
which cavalry troops will operate.
It is probable that General Wheeler
will be given" command of a brigade of
cavalry in General Lawton's depart
ment. The boundary line of Lawton's
department will embrace the territory
in which there will probably be the
heaviest fighting, so that Lawton will
be in direct charge of the most impor
tant forces in the field, and in this way
General Otis, while not being officially
"turned down." will be relieved of
much responsibility in connection with
the conduct of the war, and will be
left free to perform the duty of mili
tary Governor. '
Secretary Root is in accord with the
programme for increasing the force in
the Philippines, and with the general
plan outlined by General Otis for the
fall campaign, which has been ap
proved by the President. The Secretary
has seen many communications favor
ing a larger force, however, and if
there is not a decided improvement in
I the situation it is understood he will
advocate the sending of several addi
tional regiments in time for the au
tumn operations.
Secretary Root favors an effective
fighting force of about fifty thousand
in the Philippines. With the provis
ional nrmy of fifteen thousand already
organizing, thirty thousand regulars
already in the island, three volunteer
regiments organizing there, and non
combatants of the Signal and Hospital
Corps, a total of about 50,000 has al
ready been provided for, but the Sec
retary would like to see this number
still further increased by several regi
PLANS FOR RECEPTION
OF DEWEY AT NEW YORK
Imposing Structure in Madison Square, New York, Under Which
Will Pass the Great Land Parade in Honor of the Hero of
Manila Bay. This Triumphal Arch Will Be Erected at
Fifth Avenue and Twenty-fourth Street.
NETV YORK, Aufc. 4. â The Dewey reception commission has received a telegram from Adjutant Henry of
Mississippi, asking if the number of troops from outside States invited to take part in the parade is limited.
Secretary Foster replied that the committee would entertain all the soldiers that came. Requests from pa
triotic societies asking for places in the land parade have been received and accepted.
Admiral Dewey, with President McKinley, Governor Roosevelt, Mayor Van Wyck and the officials and
guests who will take part in the celebration of the admiral's return, will review the land parade in his honor at
Fifth avenue and Twenty-fourth street, where a triumphal arch will be erected for the occasion. Plans for this
arch have been made and accepted, and between twenty and thirty sculptors of the National Sculpture Society
have volunteered to devote their entire time to its completion. Triumphal columns on either side of Fifth avenue
from Twenty-third street to Twenty-fifth will flank the arch and form an imposing approach. The structure fol
lows in general style the famous arch of Titus. The great piers en each side of its central opening will carry
masses of sculptural adornment. Each pier will allegorically symbolize one phase of the war. One will
typify patriotism or the call to arms, another war with vessels and troops in action, the home-coming of the vic
tors will be represented in the third, and the fourth will show the volunteers returning to their peaceful pursuits.
Above these groups and serving as finials for the four columns will be portrait figures of admirals and naval offi
cers famous in American history.
MESSINA, Aug. 4.â An American warship, presumably the Olympia, passed north to-.day.
PARIS, Aug. 5.â A dispatch to the Libre Parole from St. Pierre-et-Miquelon says Governor Dachin Sibour has
been recalled. The reason is not given. The same paper says that the Austrian Government asked Admiral Dewey
to explain the statement said to have been made by him that the next war of the United States would be with
Germany and that the United States would be supported by England. To this request, Libre Parole says, Ad
miral Dewey replied that he would deny nothing. He thereupon advanced the date of his departure from Trieste
ments of regulars. There seems to be
no intention to call for any more vol
unteers.
General Lawton, It is understood, is
anxious for more cavalry troops, and
this request will probably be complied
with.
General Otis is already organizing
one additional regiment to be known as
the Eleventh Cavalry. The Fourth
Cavalry is now in the Philippines and
eight troops of the Third are under
orders to go. The Sixth Cavalry at
Fort Riley will doubtless be among any
additional regiments ordered to rein
force General Otis.
FILIPINO JUNTA
ESTABLISHED IN MANILA
NEW YORK, Aug. 4.â A World
cable from Hongkong says Aguinaldo
has an advisory council right in Ma
nila. Hongkong 1 having been made too
hot for the Filipino junta, through the
efforts of United States Consul General
Wildman, the rebels decided to attempt
to establish their headquarters in Ma
nila. They were encouraged to try this
daring experiment by the fact that un
der a recent decree of Governor Gen
eral Otis the Philippine courts are now
conducted by natives.
So Crisanto Lichancho, the treasurer
of the junta, went boldly to Manila and
professed friendship for General Otis.
The scheme worked so well that the
delighted junta has celebrated its vic
tory with a grand ball.
The British residents are disgusted
at the weakness of the American au
thorities at Manila and at the unhappy
result of Consul General Wildman's
long fight here against the rebels.
OTIS MADE ERROR

Otis to-day cabled the following: "Ma

l ington: Error in cable yesterday. Min
nesota and South Dakota take trans
port, not Montana. OTIS."
The cable of yesterday caused con
siderable dissatisfaction in Minnesota,
as it had previously been announced
' that the Minnesota Regiment was to
i sail next. Inquiries from the War De
-1 partment developed the error.

SOUTHERN PACIFIC
SHOWS ITS GREED
Seeking- to Monopolize
San Pedro.
Special Dispatch to The- Call.
I. OS ANGELES, Aug. 4.â The citizens of
San Pedro are opposed to granting to the
Southern Pacific any further rights. Par
ticularly does this apply to ferry conces
{ slons. This opposition Is the outgrowth
j of proceedings on the part of the Southern j
I Pacific by which the road obtained posses- |
I sion of lands belonging to the Terminal j
! Island Yacht Club.
At a mass-meeting resolutions condemn
: ing the course of the railroad were adopt
i cd. The resolutions declare the Terminal
j line has been a champion of the people
] in their fight for a free harbor, and that j
j the Southern Pacific Company, their re
j lentless opponent, is Inspired by a selfish
I desire to monopolize the harbor which the i
! Government proposes to construct for the
I benefit of Los Angeles County and South- ;
i crn California.
The resolutions declare that it appears |
' that John A. Muir. superintendent of the s
i Southern Pacific Company, is applying for
: a ferry franchise on San Pedro bay,
â  which is intended not for the benefit of
j the public but entirely to enable the j
I Southern Pacific to injure the Terminal <
! Company. Continuing, the resolutions
\ read:
People nf San Pedro with the p*"'! l of Los
! Angeles realize that In this effort to secure
'. the proposed ferry the Southern Pacific is at
: tempting to use the Board of Supervisors ns an â 
j Instrument: therefore the people of San Pedro I
deprecate and denounce this selfish effort of |
' the Southern Pacific Company, which attempted ;
j to prevent the Government building San Pedro ;
! harboi. We lo most earnestly protest to the
| Board of Supervisors against permitting them
i selves to be UMd, as public officials of the
i county of Lcs Angeles, for the purpose of ac- |
| complishlng the Southern Paciflc'B selfish and
| sinister designs.

HAWAII NEEDS
A GOVERNMENT
Liliuokalani Deplores
Present Conditions.
I S;.or!al Disp&tefa to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 4.â The Post
to-morrow will print an interview with
Liliuokalani, ex-Queen of the Hawaiian
Islands, who is icsiding here. The
former (Jueen receives many letters
' from home and says what the people
i need there is some head to the Govern
ment. She adds:
"Reports to the contrary notwith
standing, the islands are in a state of
practical anarchy. Weâ l say we, be
cause I count myself one of my peo
ple â have no laws but those which ob
tained for many years and a few which
I have been foisted upon us by the Ha
waiian republic.
"There is no such thins as real jus
tice. The native has not the same
standing when he goes to law with the
white man and even some of the for
i eigners find that they cannot obtain
i their dues. Laws are administered in
! a careless fashion. The Government is
an oligarchy instead of a republic. Ca
price dictates the administration of
affairs. I speak with no bitterness
i whatever. I am merely endeavoring to
I give a correct picture of the conditions.
The inhabitants of the islands know
i nothing whatever of their fate, or what
1 sort of government will be placed over
them."
Liliuokalani expresses every confi
\ dence in the honorable intentions of
! America and hopes when a decision is
' made as to a form of government for
, the islands that the officials will be ap-
I pointed from this country.

HANNA LOOKS FOR
GOLD LEGISLATION
The Silver Majority in the Senate, He
Says, Has Delayed the
Work.
INDIANAPOLIS, Aug. 4.â 11. H. Hanna,
chairman of the executive committee of
the monetary convention, has returned
from a sojourn in the East, a part of
which was spent in consultation with
members of the Senate Finance Commit
tee at Narragansett Pier. Mr. Hanna ix
pressed himself as entirely satisfied with
the prospects for financial legislation at
the next session.
"The bill agreed upon, said he, hy the
caucus committee of the House at Atlan
tic City is wisely conservative and I am
sufficiently familiar with the general prin
ciples upon which the Senate committee
Is working to express great satisfaction
over the outlook for very important gold
standard legislation during the next ses
sion of Congress. I have excellent ground
to believe that the majority in both
houses will agree in shaping and enacting
a law consistent in a broad and cour
ageous way with the pledge offered to ihe
people in the money plank in the St. Louis
platform. Those who advocated and
worked for sound money then have neen
compelled by the existing conditions in
Congress with the silver majority in the
Senate to wait long for the fruition of
their labors, but I am sure they will be
greatly pleased with what we all believe
to be the first and most important step
In the revision of our money laws.
"Those who believe in the good faith of
the St. Louis declaration will not be dis
appointed. I am confident that we shall
have a law establishing the gold stand
ard with such Hiipplementary legislation
as is necessary to maintain the parity of
all our forms of money."

Statement of Americans
in Cuba.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
HAVANA, Aug. 4. â Considerable com
ment was caused here this afternoon by
the publication of a dispatch from the
United States embodying the charge made
by a New York newspaper that Governor
General Brooke, Brigadier General Lud
low, military governor of Havana; Col
lector Tasker Bliss and Major Davis, san
itary officer at Havana, have been receiv
ing extra allowances out of the Cuban
revenues to maintain themselves in lux
ury. The fee-ling among Americans in
Havana is that this charge is based upon
a serious misapprehension of the facts of
the case.
The suggestion of luxurious living per
plexed the Cubans, who are in a position
to contrast tht- democratic way in which
the men nolding the high ranks of Gen
erals Brooke and Ludlow conduct their
establishments with the prodigal habits
of the old Spanish regime.
As to the charge that General Brooke
has expended money in repairing the
palace, the Americans reply that this oid
and historic structure had either to be
repaired and remodeled or to be palled
down and consequently about JIiiO.OOO has j
been expended on it. But, it is pointed j
out, Instead of being us heretofore the pri
vate residence of the Governor General,
the palace is now a veritable network of i
public offices, including one large wing |
devoted to the Mayor and municipal of
ficials. General Brooke's private offices
are unequal to what would be allowed |
him at any station in tin- United States, j
Aside from the general reception room, j
his apartments art- only nmrlestly fur- j
nished. As to the Governor General's car- !
riitK' 1 and horses, the fact is that the â¢
necessary expenditure in this directtion j
does not come out of the insular funds, ;
but Is met by the United States. General j
Brooke's coachman is paid in the same
way. As to the members of his staff, it
is hardly to be expected that an official
of General Brookes military and admin- j
lstrative status would pay his own trans
portation expenses.
The same answer to the charge can be
made in the case of General Ludlow, who
has only a few rooms and is liberally sur
rounded with officers. lie has very tew
servants. Not many men of equal rank
and means in . the United States would
be content with what satisfies General
Ludlow.
Brigadier Genera! Lee lives in a house
which he rents, and Generals Wilson and j
Wood, the military governors of the de- ;
partments of Matanzas-Santa Clara and
Santiago, live most democratically.
As for Colonel Bliss and Major Davis, I
army officers of their rank who hold high j
administrative offices, the opinion is gen
t-rally expressed that it is only fair to
make them a reasonable allowance to
cover what is necessary.
MANIAC THREATENS TO
MURDER AN OFFICER
Outwitted and Relieved of the Pistol
With Which He Sought to
Take Life.
STOCKTON, Aug. 4.â Deputy Sheriff
Smith faced death at the hands of a
maniac this morning. A telephone mes
sage took him and Constable Grant to
the Mullen place on Sharps lane, four
miles south of Stockton. Mrs. Mullen
and her child had been driven from their
i home by a demented man armed with a
! pistol, and were crouching in the weeds
by the road, afraid to come from under
cover. When the officers arrived the
crazy man was seated on :i pile "f sacks,
and as Smith went around the house he
ran into a pistol muzzle The fellow
aimed straight at his body and dartd tne
officer to arr< st him.
Smith was unarmed and started in to
parley with the man. telling him he had
come t" levy an attachment. He knocked
at the dour and pretended to get an
answer from inside, not molesting the
maYiiac. who had him covered all the
time. The maniac was finally outwitted
and lowered his weapon. Grant seized
the revolver and the fellow was put into
the carriage and brought to Stockton.
At the courthouse he made a desper
ate fight, and it required three men to
hold him. He gave th* name of Jim
Budd. The man is about 3u years old.
He lived at Miller's San Joaquin House
here.

MISCELLANEOUS.
WONDERFUL
CURE OF HON.
WM. MITCHELL
Suffered for Twenty Years
With Catarrh, Stomach,
Sore Eyes and Lung
Troubles.
Was Instantly Relieved by Dr.
Aborn, the Spxiaiist, at
554 Suiter Street.
WELL KNOWN JUDGE OF OREGON
He Testifies in Strong Language to
ths Lffichncy o His Treatment
by Dr. Aborn.
Dr. Aborn'f< excellent work as a special-
ist in tin- treatment of obstinate and
chronic diseases of the stomach, lungs,
eye and ear, and all catarrhal and bron-
chial affections is evidenced by the ac-
companying testimonial by Hon. William
Mil. hell, County Judge of Morrow Coun-
ty Oregon, and residing at Heppner. in
the county named. Dr. Aborn is the spe-
cialist in diseases of the eye, ear, throat
and lungs:
THIS IS TO CERTIFY
That for twenty years I was afflicted
with catarrh of the head,, and also
was suffering from granulated sore
eyes; my throat and bronchial tubes
and lungs were also affected, caus-
ing affection of the stomach, which re-
sulted in indigestion and sour stomach,
caused by the catarrhal secretions drop-
ping down from my head into the throat
and passing into the stomach. In fact.
I was afflicted from the crown of my head
down. 1 had tried almost all catarrhm
remedies without being cured, and as the
disease was so SERIOUSLY AFFECT-
ING my THROAT, STOMACH and
LUNGS, I BECAME ALARMED, for I
knew the disease would soon TERM IN -
| ATE IN CONFIRMED CONSUMPTION.
i I had the measles thirty odd years ago,
I and my eyes have been affected since that
time. My ears also became affected,
caused by the catarrh, so that I was quite
: hard of hearing. It will be seen by the
statement of my case that my ailments
were quite complicated, and I have had
as many complications of ailments as any
j one man could well endure. In this pain-
ful and distressing condition I placed my-
self under the treatment of Dr. Aborn,
â  and I am most happy to state that Dr.
I Aborn has displayed a masterly hand over
mv complication of diseases, and GAVK
j ME INSTANTANEOUS RELIEF.
My catarrhal affection, throat and
I stomach, and my eyes have also improved
! as by magic under his treatment in five
â¢ days' time. He has also improved my
hearing. I now return to my home at
Heppner, Morrow County, Oregon, where
; I am County Judge. I am a pioneer set-
i tier of Umatilla and Morrow counties.
1 having located in Umatilla County in 1 V 59
: and I am well known throughout Eastern
Oregon. From the speedy relief I have
received from the skillful and scientific
treatment at the hands of Dr. Aborn I
can cheerfully and conscientiously recom-
; mend all similarly afflicted to apply to
Dr Aborn with the utmost confidence
that he understands the SUCCESSFUL
TREATMENT OF THESE OBSTINATE
ANH CHRONIC COMPLAINTS. Very
truly, WM. MITCHELL,
County Judge. Morrow County, Oregon.
Residence, Heppner, Oregon.
Thirty years of Dr. Aborn's successful
practice have been devoted to the treat-
ment of diseases of the eye, ear, catarrh
of the head, asthma and all affections of
tli.- lungs, heart, liver, kidneys and diges-
tive organs. Sufferers from these com-
plaints would do well to call upon him
for free consultation. Dr. Aborn's office
hours are from 9:30 a. m. to-,12 m. and 2
t,. 4 p. m. His treatment revitalizes the
1 system and builds up the impaired con-
! stltutlon.

Murder in a Tuolumne
Town.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
STOCKTON, Aug. 4.â William Mitch
ell shot and killed John Sheehan at
eland, a small town on the Yo-
Valley road in Tuolumne Coun
ty, this morning at about 10 o'clock.
The cause of the tragedy is said to
have been the attentions Sheehan had
â  paying to Mitchell's wife. Though
Mitchell protested, friends claim they
been expecting a tragedy for
some weeks.
The men met in front of the Grove
land postoffice and Mitchell immediate
ly opened fire. Four shots were fired
by him, and all of them took effect.
â¢r of them, it is said, would have
produced fatal results, as Mitchell is
such a good shot that he placed them
in vital spots. Sheehan did not return !
the fire but sank to the ground and
expired ab-ut twenty-five minutes aft-;
erward, when he was removed to a
house near by.
The murderer escaped during the
confusion and obtained quite a lead
before the authorities started after
him He was a Deputy Sheriff and
Constable and is familiar with the
mountain country and will not be eas
ily arrested He is a middle-aged man,
with a young and pretty wife. Shee- j
han was single and had been residing
Groveland for some time past.
Mrs. Mitchell is visiting friends at Liv
ingston.

There were no new cases and only
i one death at the home to-day, accord
! ing to a report Dr. Vickery, the surgeon
at the institution, st-nt to the Surgeon
General to-night. Dr. Vickery ex
pressed the opinion that the immune
help on their way there should be suf
ficient, as the epidemic seems to be
checked. The cordon around the home !
and the immediate adjoining village of;
Phoebus. Surgeon White says, is as
tight as he ever saw it at any place.
The Postoffice Department reports
that the mails are non being dis
patched into the quarantined points on
the Virginia peninsula twice daily, and

oughly fumigated.
.\i;\VPORT NEWS, Aug. 4.â No new j

Woodfin claims that one of the deaths
was due to consumption and not to yel
low fever.
SEATTLE, Aug. 4.â William Thomas
of Columbia City, Wash., who, it was
stated in yesterday's dispatches was
thought by Marine Hospital officials at
Hampton to have introduced yellow
fever in the Soldiers' Home there, said
to-day that there was no foundation
for the statement.
He was an inmate of the home for a
while, as represented, but was not sick
while there, neither has he had any
symptoms of yellow or other kind of

SERIOUS RIOT AT
FORT MTHERSON
Eight Injured in a Fracas Between
Volunteers and Regu
lars.
CHICAGO, Aup. 4.â A special to the
Tribune from Atlanta, Ga.. says: A riot
between the regular and volunteer forces
stationed at Port McPherson yesterday
afternoon resulted in the wounding of
eight soldiers.
The recruits of the Twenty-ninth Vol
unteers had just received their pay and
coming Into town spent most of it for
liquor. On returning to the fort some of
the volunteers became engaged in a con
troversy with the regulars and they began
to flgrht with bayonets and revolvers. So
lif-rco was the fracas that the services of
a company of regulars with fixed bayo
nets were required before order could be
restored. As a result of the riot eight
men occupy bunks at the post hospital to
day and it is feared some will die. The
officers refuse to divulge names or par
ticulars.

UNEXPECTED DELAY OF
SAMOAN COMMISSION
WASHINGTON, An?. 4.â The non-arri
val of the Sanroan commission Is begin
ning to attract comment in ottVial circles,
as it is thought some new- complication
may have arisen in Samoa to keep the
commission there.
The la*t report was that the party
would leave Apia on July IS and if this
had been cairied out the commission
would have been in San Francisco before
the present time. As the bulk of the na
tives were disarmed there is little pros
pect that they could cause serious disor
der, vet in case of renewing trouble be

FITZPATRICK WAS
COOLLY RECEIVED
Canadians Rejected His
Invitations.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 4.â W. P. Fitz
patrick of the Treasury Department has
just returned to Washington from Ot
tawa, where he went at the instance of
i the committee of citizens of Chicago in
: charge of the ceremonies of laying the
' cornerstone of that city's postoffice build-
I ing next October by President McKinley
to arrange for the formal invitation and
i expected acceptance of an invitation from
Chicago's citizens to the Governor Gen
eral and Cabinet of Canada to participate
in these festivities. Mr. Fitzpatrick la
the Assistant United States Architect for
the Chicago building.
To an Associated Press representative
he admitted that his official reception was
Blightly chilly, Sir Wilfrid Laurier can
didly telling him that under the present
conditions it would be impossible for him
to accept or even to consider any special
invitation to this side of the border..
Mr Fitzpatrick says that in substance
1 Sir Wilfrid's voluntary statements and
answers to queries were as follows: 'As
a friend in whom I am deeply interested
I am very glad to see you. but, frankly,
as a. representative of the Federal or any
local government in the United States
your visit could not have been more un
timely When I received your first letter
I took up the matter with his Excellency
i the Governor General, and he expressed a
sincere desire to visit Chicago and seemed
I as anxious to accept the invitation as I
i was. We would have been delighted to go
and were looking forward to the day with
much anticipation. But since then the
tone of your press has become so harsh
aling with the Alaskan boundary
question, such misrepresentations have
been made about our Government and
particularly about me that it would be
undignified for us to visit you, and I can
not advise his Excellency to go."
Mr. Fitzpatrick said that Sir Wilfrid
Laurier intimated that in the present
siat.- of public feeling in the United States
dicated in the press it would not be
' entirely safe for the Governor General and
i himseif to visit Chicago, as he feared that
they mifcht, in the great gathering of
such a character as the Chicago cere
mony, be subjected to some unpleasant
ness or Indignity by thoughtless persons.
Sir Wilfrid expressed himself as strongly
â in favor of arbitrating the Alaskan
j boundary dispute.
TWO-TEN TROT WON
BY TOMMY BRITTON
Result of the First Race at Colum
bus a Surprise to the
Talent.
COLUMBUS, 0., Aug. 4.â Rain again
interfered with the races at the Columbus
Driving Park to-day. After the 2:10 trot
had been finis. .cd and four heats trotted
in the 2:14 class a thunderstorm came up,
and before the rain had ceased the track
was soaked. It was hoped, however, that
the racing mignt be resumed, and the
crowd was held until very late, when it
became evident that the horses could not
start, and the races were postponed until
to-morrow.
There were four events on the card to
day, including the 2:10 trot postponed from
Thursday. This was the first started,
and it proved a surprise to the talent.
Tommy Britton winning in straight heats
without being urged. Elloree was favorite
in the betting on the strength .of her
showing at Cleveland, but she was not a
factor In the race. Cresceus, although not
fast enough to press Tommy Britton, beal
Elloree out for second money easily.
Pour heats were trotted in the 2:14 class.
There were ten starters in the race, but
tho contest lay between Surpola. Success
and Charley Herr. Surpola was the fa
vorite, but Success sold almost equally
well in the pools, and Charley Herr had
many backers. Surpola trotted the first
beat without a break and won easily by
two lengths. The gray mare acted badly
in every heat after that. In the second
1 heat Surpola went off her feet after pass
ing the three-quarters, and was beaten
out by both Charley Herr and Success.
In the third heat the mare broke at the
half and fell back so far that she could
not fill the gap between the leaders, and
wan beaten out by the same horses in re
verse order. Success taking the heat. In
the fourth heat Curry, who had driven Sur
pola, gave way to Hutchings, but the
change didn't prove a fortunate one. Com
ing down the homestretch Surpola and
Success were neck and neck when the
former broke and Hutchings allowed the
mare to run. She found her gait before
the wire was reached, however, and won
out by half a length, but was set back
to second place, the heat being given to
Success. This race and the 2:21 pace and
the 2:20 trot were postponed to to-morrow.

OIL DERRICK OWNERS
DEFY THE CITIZENS
Determined to Continue the Attempt
to Deface the Santa Barbara
Beach.
SANTA BARBARA, Aug. 4. âJ. C.
French, H. J. Nelson, J. A. Cody and
George- Tuttle, the owners of the oil der
rick and machinery a party of citizens
destroyed because they defaced the beach,
will commence suit against the citizens
to-morrow. They have given notice that
they will begin work immediately to erect
the derrick on the spot on which it was
torn down, and say that should an at
tempt be made to tear it down a second
time they will defend their property with
their lives.
Public sentiment is very strong against
the men who are attempting to obstruct
the beach front, and it is thought that
should another attempt be made to erect a
derrick scores of citizens will assist in
wrecking it. The citizens of Santa Bar
hara are determined not to have the
beauty of the beach marred by the un
sightly oil derricks.

PERJURY TRIED
IN TRANSVAAL
Krugrer's Son Wanted
False Evidence.
Sr>Â«c!al Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, Aug. 6.â The Johannes
burg correspondent of the Times, who
furnishes evidence of the attempt of
the Transvaal Government agents in
the recent conspiracy case to manufac
ture testimony implicating the British
Government and the South African
League, says:
President Kruger's son, who is the
head of the Secret Service Department,
tried to induce one of the witnesses for
the prosecution to do his utmost to
prove the case to be one of conspiracy
on the part of the British Government,
as that would strengthen Mr. Kruger's
hands. This was on the very eve of
the Bloemfontein conference.
The Berlin correspondent of the Daily
Mail say 3: I learn that the real rea
son why Empemr William did not go
to Cowes was the acute state of the
Transvaal question. The letter deliv
ered yesterday to the Queen at Os
borne House by Lieutenant Freiherr
â¼on -Strombeck explains thfs, repeats
the Emperor's regrets and contains a
promise to visit her Majesty during
the autumn.
There is some talk of a previous
meeting between the Prince of Wales
and Emperor William at Empress
Frederick's castle near Homburg.
PRETORIA, Aug. 4.â Herr Fischer,
the special agent of the Oiange Free
State, has arrived here to confer with
the Transvaal Government, presumabiy
with the view of the altered situation
resulting from the message nf the Brit
ish Secretary of State for the Colonies,
Joseph Chamberlain, regarding the ap
pointment of a joint commission to in- '
quire into the effect which the net
franchise proposals of the Transvaal
Government will have on the position
of the Outlanders.
Mr. Fischer has conferred with Presi
dent Kruger, and the former's peace
ful views inspire confidence.
The Volksraad has postponed consid
eration of the report of the dynamite
commission in order to permit the com
mission to consult its European direc
tors.
CAPE TOWN, Aug. 4.â ln the House
of Assembly to-day Cecil Rhodes ex
pressed a belief that the Transvaal
difficulty "would be overcome in a few
months and without a shot being fired,
owing to the moderation displayed." |
He predicted .that capital would then
flow freely.

GRAND JURY MAY BE
CONVENED AT ONCE
Marin Officials Investigating the Use
of Money in 'the Case of
Harvey.
SAN RAFAEL. Aug. 4.â The publication
of Mrs. J. P. Roberts' story in regard to
I the alleged bribing of jurors at the trial j
of Joseph Harvey on a charge of conduct- |
ing a banking game in his poolroom at |
| Sausalito has produced consternation j
â  among gambling cohorts. This uneasiness
1 was increased to-day when It was learned
! that if Sheriff Taylor and District Attor
ney Mclsaac succeeded in obtaining j
enough evidence to indict the principals ,
to the affair Judge Angellotti will not wait !
until the Grand Jury holds its regular
! session next October but will call that
body together at once.
The part ascribed to R. M. Donne in the
affair is the only material element of Mrs.
Roberts' tale discredited. It is not be
lleved the woman is misrepresenting the
facts as stated to her, but that her hus
i band erred either intentionally or other
! wise. Donne is a prominent merchant of
the community and has always enjoyed i
an excellent reputation for honesty and
Integrity. The interview published in a |
morning paper in which he is said to have j
admitted that Roberts approached him on i
a ferryboat and demanded his share of j
â¢ the "swag" is vigorously denied by Donne, j
"I told the representative of this paper
what I have told the others," said Donne ;
to-day. "I explained to him that I did
i not know whether or not money had been j
expended in securing an acquittal, but I
that if it was I hadnothing to do with it.
I said furthermore that I had never seen
Roberts since the jury acquitted Harvey j
to talk with him alone. Why I should
have been misrepresented in this matter I
I am at a loss to explain."

in a striped suit, a black fedora hat, kid
gloves, tight fitting trousers and good
shoes. Across the chest of the figure was
a sign two by four feet with this legend:
"Astor. the traitor."

tried to make a speech, but the police
ordered him on. Up Sixth avenue to
Longacre went the wagon. There Dr.
Crowe planted the barrel on the asphalt,
poured over it two quarts of oil and ap
plied a match. The flames crackled and
licked up the figure. A big hole was
burned in the asphalt pavement. The
police arrived too late to find the doctor.
He had disappeared in the crowd. His
driver was arrested, but released at the
station house. The police are looking for
Dr. Crowe.
Dr. Crowe has been much interested in
the reports about Mr. Astor taking the
oath of allecriance to Queen Victoria. The
more he read the madder he grew. For
some days he has talked of little else,
and his act to-night was no surprise to
his neighbors.

just come to light that Lucius F. Mellen,

into the shop by a boy, who called tc two
men within that he had lidden on a

years a leader of national fame in church
and charitable work.

DOGS NEEDED
IN THE QUEST

Such Is the Opinion of Sports

The first flurry among the sportsmen
which always marks the opening of the
shooting season is over and they ari set
tling down to a quiet ijoyment of the
sport. Many prepare elaborately for the
shooting, but a few days in the field sat
isfies them and they are content to hear
of the experiences oi their friends in the
lield. The genuine sportsmen, on the other
hand, are just getting seasoned for the
hardships of the chase and enjoy each
week end on the trail of deer. These have
by no means been killed off, but from all
directions comes word that dogs are a
necessity, still-hunting being pronounced
a falluir wherever tried.

PREPARING FOR FOOTBALL
In another week the University of Cal
ifornia will begin its fall semester and
the football season will open with a pre
lude, for no sooner do the college men
foregather than the work of discovery and
the search for material beging. The great
Kelly, Princeton's wonderful halfback,
will reach thia coast about the first week
in September and will begin work where
Garrett Cochran left off. Cochran will
arrive some two weeks later and the two
Kasterners will then co-operate for a
month, at the end of which time Cochran
will return to his mines in New Mexico,
where he will remain until the last month
of the season. He will be with the blue
and gold athletes during the finishing
weeks and map out the pian of battle in
the big intercollegiate event.
Coach Chamberlain of Vale will con
duct the football operations at Stanford.
He has a reputation that is aJmost the
equal of Cochran. and is a man of great
personal magnitude. He will not arrive
until the middle of September, but will
find hiH team fairly well organized at
that time as the Stanford men will be
gin , rellminary work as soon as the col
l"ro opens. The football season this year
v.-ill be the most interesting of any up
to date. Stanford will fight for lost
laurels and the university will battle to
retain a single but a glorious victory.
The new Berkeley president will ba a
factor in football athletics at the Uni
vernity of California. It is eaid that he
v.-11l stir" up a dopth of enthusiasm that
knows no measurement.
The college teams hayÂ« a strong eleven
to light in the preliminary games. Olym

T. L. Miller of the Corinthians a chal
lenge for the San Francisco challenge cup,
which was deeded by J. M. Macdor.ough
in 1595 to the yachtsmen of the I'acilic
Coast as a perpetual trophy. It was lirst
presented to the Encinal Yacht Club in
trust, and was retained for that olub by
J. A. Leonard's sloop El Sueno, which de
feated the San Francisco yacht Queen,
and later by the sloop Fawn, whicn won
from the Catherine. Then the Corinthians
challenged with the sloop Aeolus, which
defeated the Fawn, and has held the cup
ever since.
In his challenge Secretary Bartlvti said
that the challenger is the sloop Gadder;
owned by Matthew Turner, anu that her
general dimensions are 30 feet ovi i all
and 25 feet on the load water line. The j
exact sailing length he promised to give
later. A meeting of the board of direc
tors of the Corinthian yacht Club was
held on Thursday night, at which time
after careful consideration it was decided
to return the challenge on the ground
that it doea not comply with the terms
of the deed of gift under which th-3 cup
Is held by the ciub.
The Corinthians are ready to accept a
challenge regular in form, but do not
think they would be justified in accept
ing one which does not give the sailing
length of the challenger within a fraction
of a foot at least. The Gadder is to have
a house put on, as the conditions require
the challenger to be a cabin yacht. She
will also have a fin keel added, and her
sail plan enlarged. The Corinthians are
desirous of having the excitement of a
cup race, and so soon as the dimensions
of the challenger are given will readily
accept the challenge. They wish to have
time in which to prepare their defender,
make necessary alterations and put her
in the pink of condition. The contest
must take place not less than thirty nor
more than sixty days after the date or
the challenge, and must be sailed between
May l and- September 30.
The Corinthians, as matters stand at
present, do not know what yacht to ae
fend with, as the defender must be within
10 per cent qf the sailing length ot the
challenger, according to the rules of the
Seawannaka-Corinthian Yacht Clud.
The ocean yacht race that will form a
part of the carnival of sports at Mon
terev will take place on Sunday. August !
27 so as to give as large a number of
persona as possible an opportunity of tvit
nessing it. The entries will be the pilot
boat Bonlta, E. A. Wiltsee's schoonor
Aggie, J. D. Spreckels" schooner Lurline,
H. R. Simpkins" yawl Tramontane and
one or two other large craft.

GOLFERS WILL
MEET ON DEL
MONTE LINKS
Sharp Competition Expected for
the Crocker Cup.
A Team of Six Southern Ca'ifornians
Will Do Batcle Against Local
Hoot Mons
It has been stated recently that little j
golf is being played at present in the j
neighborhood of San Francisco. As re
gards San Rafael nothing could be fur
ther from the truth. Play is constantly
going on at the links not only on Satur
days and Sundays but also throughout the
week. The bathhouses are in use and
many players take a plunge after coming
in from a round of the course. The rest
aurant in the clubhouse has lately been
the scene of several reunions in the even
ing, dinner parties having been given
there by Mr. and Mrs. Runyon, Mr. and
Mrs. F. H. Green, Mr. and Mrs. F. S.
Johnson, Baron J. H. yon Schroeder and
Carter P. Pomeroy. Last Saturday the
San Rafael Hunt Club, many of the mem
bers of which also belong to the golf
club, finished their run within a quarter
of a mile of the links and came in to the
clubhouse for tea. The nine-nole course
is being used, but work will soon begin
on the remaining nine greens. The com
plete eighteen-hole course will be ready
in the fall and will be the prettiest and
best appointed links in the State. The
club is increasing its members and is in
excellent financial condition.
Golf will form an important feature of
the carnival of sports to be held at Del
I Monte from August 19 to 27. Indeed. Sa
urday, August 19, has been added to th
week within which it was originally in
tended the sports should take place
accommodate the golfers. As the Court
at Del Monte is only a nine-hole one it
not possible to complete a competition s
quickly fts on an eiglTteen-hole links. Th
arrangements for the golf tournamen
Ebeen made by a committee cmisis
f S. L. Abbott Jr. of the San Krai
Golf Club; W. P. Johnson. Oaklai
Club; J. Lawson. Burlingame Coun
lub (who has recently returned fro
. Britain) and Carter P. Pomero
in of the San Rafael Golf Club. O
ay. August 21. the Qualifying comp
for ladles who wish to contend fo
ieorge Crocker cup will be held. I
will be at eighteen holes, medal play, am
the sixteen ladles who hand In the be
Is will be entitled to enter the cv
petition on the following day. Th
competition will be at eighteen hole
:h play. On Wednesday the qualif.
competition for the Del Monte cup for
will take place at eighteen holes,
fil play. The sixteen players making
best scores will be entitled to enter
final competition, which will take
c on Thursday and Friday. On Sat
ty, August 28, the match between
is of six men representing North and
:h California will take place. The
local team will Include E. R. Folger gf
Oakland. J. Lawson of Burlingame, S. L.
Abbott Jr. and E. J. McCutchen of the
San Francisco club and two others not
yet chosen. C. E. Maud, president of the
Riverside Polo and Golf Club, will captain
the southern team, which will include E.
Conde Jones, E. B. Tufts, W. Cosby and
J. F. Sartori of the LÂ«os Angeles Country
Club and W. H. Young of Santa Monica.
C. K. Maud won the men's championship
at the Santa Catalina Island golf tourna
ment on June IT with a score of 166, E.
Conde Jones being second with a score of
167 for thirty-six holes. These are all
strong players, with plenty of experience
in open tournament play, and will take
a good deal of beating. Tournaments are
much more frequent In the south than
around San Francisco, the clubs at Los
Angeles, Santa Monica and Santa Cata
lina being particularly active in promot
ing open competitions.
CYCLERS TO DISCUSS RACING
The regular monthly meeting of Califor
nia Associated Cycling Clubs will be held
this evening at room 582 Parrott building.
Among other business to be considered
will be the election of a second vice pres
ident, the present holder of the office, T.
D. Whitman of the Acme Club, having
resigned. Arrangements for the twenty
mile race In September and the ten-mile
race in October will also have to be dis-
cussed.
The Bay City Wheelmen will hold two
tournaments, one of pool, the other of
whist, this even^g at tbe clubhouse, 4ji
Golden Gate avenue. The winners and
losers will be suitably rewarded, and light
refreshments will be served during the
evening. The Bay Citys' run to the Sal
awir farm will be held early in Septem
ber.
The great relay race between teams
from Reno and Carson will take place ai
Carson on August 13. Considerable inter
est is manifested in the event here, as
both teams are being handled by San
Francisco trainers and many of the riders
are well known here. This is the third
annual event 01 its kind, each club having
won one of the previous races.
TENNIS CLAIMS MANY
OF THE OLD DEVOTEES
With two tournaments in immediate
prospect, tennis is a live pastime at pres
ent. The eyes of the racket wielders are
turned toward the shady courts of De!
Mont-, for in less than two weeks the
handicap doubles tournament will be
played there. It is over two years since
a tournament of any consequence has
1 een played at this beautiful seaside re-
, Fort and there will be more than the usual
interest displayed for this reason.
Besides the young and advancing tennis
players, the old-timers who have won
cups and prizes galore yean back will
take part. The tournament precedes the
great week of sport, and many of the
polo players, gentlemen riders and crack
Shots will lie at the hotel while the tennis
matches are in progress. It is likely they
will take a racket in hand and fight on
the asphalt once again.
The teams have not yet been organized,
but one has only to drop in at the Cali
fornia, Oakland and Alanuda courts to
note the preparations. It is all doubles.
The best teams on the coast will not par
ticipate for a number of reasons. The
Whitnt vs. do not favor handicap affairs
and the Hardy team will not be together
on the ISth and 19th, as Sumner will play
in Santa Monica at that time. Sam will
double up with some Oakland man, but
the Whitneys will not play at allâ that N,
together. George may give an exhibition
with Joe Daily or his brother, Robert N.
At a recent meeting of the Pacific States
Lawn T< nnls Association George Whitney
was elected a member of the board and
was placed on the executive committee.
The question of the scene of the cham
pionship doubles in singles was discusst â¢!
and for the first time in three yean
Rafael was counted out of the race. The
tournament will be held rither at Del
Mo'Ote or at the Venrtcme, San Jose. The
latter place is the choice of the Oakland
contingent, while the California Club men
favor the former. There is no Opposition
to the Vendome on either side, so it is
likely the championship doubles will be
held at San Jose.
The Whitneys have announced them
selves as competitors in this tournament.
Robert N. Whitney has returned from a
camping trip; both he and his brother
George have determined to play in
doubles. They have begun practicing for
the championship and will work Bteadll)
from now until the 9th of September. th'Â»
day of the tournament. With, the Hardy
and the Whitney brothers once more lii
the field, doubles will be a game not for
children but experts.
There was quite an active week at the
California Tennis Club. Most of the play
ers have returned from their vacations
and taken up their favorite sport once
again, Weihe. Root. Bliven, the Whitneys
nnd several of the lady players have been

R. McArthur, Captain, Is Barred as
an Amateur.
University of California Boys Stiil Seek
a Fast Barge for the North
ern Regatta.
The South End Boat Club's senior
barge crew has been broken up by tho
decision of the registration committrp of
the Pacific Association that Robert M â â -
Arthur professionalized himself when
he accepted a fee for his services as ref-
eree of a boxing contest. This is for
many reasons to be regretted, as the
"Midgets" were as good a crew as ever
rowed here, and R. McArthur is an ex
cellent coach and captain. A strict con
struction of the , rules of the Amateur
Athletic Uninn may have left the regis
tration committee without any alterna
tive, but the less stringent English rule
in such matters seems more reasonable.
There a professional in one sport may be
an amateur in another if he engages in
that other in a genuinely amateur spirit.
A man may get his living by his skill in
cricket, just as he may by his knowl
edge of law or medicine; but he is not
therefore a professional oarsman, foot
ball player or golfer. The Henley regatta
is one of the most purely amateur meet
ings in the world, yet even there the
rules would not exclude professionals in
other sports than rowing, unless they
were obnoxious to the manual labor
clause. The South End men feel hurt
at the decision of the registration com
mittee and will try to have McArthur
reinstated. The registration commis
sioners, H. A. Widemann, A. P. Roth
kopf and George James, decided against
McArthur by a vote of 2 to 1.
The arrangements in this city for the
Astoria regatta are progressing and it
is known what crews and scullers will
go there. The South Ends have no barge
crew, but Dr. C. C. Dennis and J. Foley
are practicing regularly and will rep
resent the club in the skiff and shell
races. The Alameda senior barge crew
will be in better condition than last year
and will make a hard struggle to retain
itsÂ«position. The club will send a skiff
as well as a barge, and F. Avers will
probably enter the outrigged skiff race.
It is likely that C. H. Smith, president of
the Alameda Boat Club, will accom
pany the crew, and 9. J. Pembroke will
be the guest of the carnival committee.
The Pioneers, having no suitable barge
to row in, will not enter the regatta.
The University of California crew Is
practicing on Oakland Creek in pair
oars and will row with Tracy as stroke.
Ray Fryer, who lives at Pomona, has
been telegraphed for and will be here
to-day. J. Hopper will probably go up
to-day to Stockton in the hope of per
suading the directors of the Stockton
Athletic Association to loan their fa*t
barge to the university crew. J. E. Budd,
on behalf of the Stockton Athletic Asso
ciation, has offered the use of the barge
Patterson, in which the university crew
rowed in a regatta on Oakland Creek
two years ago, but says that the direct
ors are unwilling to allow the new barge
to be taken away as it Is an Eastern
built boat and they are of opinion that
damage done to it could not be repaired
on this coast. The Patterson is not
quite so quick on the turn as the new
bargfl and the university crew Is anxious
not to be in any way handii apped by its
boat. If the new Stockton burge can
not be secured George James of the
Olympic Club will endeavor to get the
Olympic barge for -them.

Sport in Variety.
Directors Present an Illuminated Ad'
dress to Herman Oilrichs, Pa
tron of Box ng.
There was boxing in variety in thÂ«
arena of the Olympic Athletic Club last
night The three bouts which had been
arranged by the directors went th_- full
limit of ten rounds each, the referee call
ing for two extra rounds in the one be
tween Vickers and Baker. The victors
were George Baker, Charles Thurston and
F. Ast.
The bout between Ast and Woods was
by far the best of the evening and one of
the best ever seen in the club. Both men.
were clean hitters and aggressive, and at
times the end seemed close at hand. For
the first two rounds the boxers feinted,
each trying to draw the other's tire. In.
the third round they came together ami
gave blow for blow. Ast was vicious,
landing right and left and then jabbing
with tne left. Woods came back with,
some effective left swings, but was in dis.
tr< bb at the end of the round.
Ast went at his opponent from the
sound of the bell in the next round, but
Woods proved game, and when he s-eenru'd.
about done for he came back and foujrht
Ast to a standstill. The fifth round waa
full of action, and the men both showed
signs of distress. They then slowed down
considerably until the tenth round, when
each tried his best to get a commanding
lead. For a time it did not seem possible
for Woods to last until the gong would
sound for hostilities to cease.
He suddenly turned on Ast. however,
and, raining blows on him, soon had him
in difficulty. Both men were fighting at
the end of the round. George Kckhardt.
the referee, awarded the bout to Ast. It
was announced that Wood broke his right
hand in the fourth round.
The spectators disagreed with Referee
Eckhardt when he awarded the second
bout to Thurston. The friends of George
Simpson, the Acme boxer, believed t:->

THE TURNER RIFLEMEN.
The prize shooting of the Turners at

that the rifle contests took place in a gal*
of wind that swept down through the

holding and shooting out of tho question.

Cleo Hill, a young woman whose heart

old companions. Cocktails and other

asserted themselves.
She then visited a lady friend on O'Far

hours before starting home. Several of
her friends met her and to them she
shouted in ribald mirth that she intended
to end her life.
Early In the afternoon Mrs. Hill was
found on Powell street in a most precari

CORPORAL FRED ROCKPELLAR,
Company Mâ The physical conditions ex
isting in the Philippines are excellent â
for the natives. A white man can neither
make money nor be happy there. The
land, 'tis true, is fertile and its products
are numerous; but a white man can't
compete with the negroes. Of course, if
a white man wanted to live there real bad
1 guess be could get along, but he would,
in my judgment, have to stay there fully
two years and become thoroughly accli
mated before he would be worth anything.
If he was a laborer he would have to
work for almost nothing. Labor is cheap
there and the natives are accustomed to
manual labor from childhood. If a man
goes Into a store and buys anything there
arc a dozen little negroes scarcely over
6 years of age waiting outside to pack
the bundle for a small coin. The Filipinos
can pack more on their backs than a
white man. They do all their own dray
ing right on their backs. The introduction
of American agricultural methods in their
farming would enrich the valuation of
the occupation and perhaps better the
products, but I think it out of the ques
tion for a white man to attempt to make
money down in that country by farming.
Wheat cannot he raised there. They have
large corn and rice tields, but for my part
the Filipinos can have them. I am op
posed to making them citizens of our
country.

CONTRACTS ARE
NOW READY FOR
GRAPE GROWERS
H. J. Crocker Backs
Up His Offer.
THIRTY DAYS' TIME TO ACCEPT
THE DOCUMENT APPEARS TO BE
QUITE FAIR.
Values Based on Saccharine Strength
of the Grapes on Delivery â In
terested Parties May De
feat the Enterprise.
The contract proposed to the grape
growers and winemakers of the State hy
Henry J. Crocker, in which he offered $14
per ton for the best grapes and $12 for
the second quality, was completed yester
day and will be sent out at once. The
value is based on the saccharine strength
of the grapes on delivery and the stipula
tions appear to be fair. Whether or not
Mr. Crocker will secure the necessary
80 per cent of the crop of dry wine grapes
for the term of seven years remains to be
seen. However, the enthusiastic indorse
ment of the proposition by the growers
of Sonoma, Santa Clara and other coun
ties augurs well for the success of the
plan.
While to the layman the contract ap
pears to be unnecessarily technical and
capable of manipulation, to the practical
winemaker it is entirely plain. It fixes
the prices as follows: .
For ripe, sound, merchantable wine
grapea (except Malvasia and Mission), con
taining; not less than twenty-two (22) de-'
grees sugar, according to Balling's scale,
at sixty ( 60) degrees Fahrenheit, crusher
te3t, fourteen (14) dollars per ton, at point
of delivery-
Fore ripe Malvasia and Mission grapes of
the same standard, twelve (12) dollars per
ton. - i '-''.
For grapes falling below twenty-two (22)
degrees, the price to be reduced fifty (50)
cents per ton for each degree or fraction
of a degree of sugar below twenty-two
(22) degrees (Balling) and down to and mi
i eluding twenty (20) degrees.
For grapes falling below twenty (20) de
grees sugar (Balling), the price to be re
duced one (1) dollar per ton -for each de
gree or fraction of a degree of sugar below
twenty (20) degrees (Balling) down to and
Including nineteen (19) degrees.
For grapes below nineteen (19) degrees
sugar (Balling), the price shall be fifty (50)
cents per ton for each full degree of sugar
contained therein, according to Balling's
scale.
For second crop wine grapes the price
shall be seventy-five (75) per cent of the
foregoing scale for first crop grapes.
For damaged grapea, not sound or mer
chantable, or such as will not make good
wine, but suitable for distilling, seven (7)
dollars per ton.
An important stipulation in connection
with the contract provides that at any
time the party of the second part shall
have the right to terminate the contract
â whenever he shall under similar con-Â«
tracts with other grape-growers be un
able, without litigation, to secure in any
year within the term, at least 80 per cent
of the grapes grown in the State. In such
an event the party of the second part
may upon thirty days' notice in writing
terminate the compact.
In a letter accompanying the document
Mr. Crocker announces that he has se

sume the Filipinos find farming a profit- '
able business, but I am sure a white in la
would not. It would be a disgrace to even
suggest that the natives should be made
citizens of this country.
CORPORAL BOYNTON, Company Mâ
The opportunities for securing land in the
Philippines, 1 should judge, are limited.
Most of it is owned by the church or peo
ple connected with it. Under existing
conditions, however, it is a poor place for
a laboring man to go. The quality of
their productions is good. The introduc
tion of improved farming implements
would improve the country Immensely,
but at that I don't think anybody but a
Filipino or a Chinaman could grow rich ]
there. Their labor standard is extremely
low. You can get a nigger to perform al
most any service for a quarter. They live I
on ric - and can afford to work much .
cheaper than a white man. No, I think
it quite impossible to introduce our labor
system. In fact. I believe it out of the i
question. Whether or not the Philippines
will ultimately prove a benefit to this
country I do not care to discuss. I am '
opposed to making the natives citizens of :
thia country under any circumstances.
They are extremely ignorant, and the ma
jority of them are low-bred creatures.
SERGEANT ARTHUR TODD. Company
M â The. islands are no place for a white '
man. They are thickly populated with
negroes who are a decidedly low class of
people. Amencan agricultural methods
could be introduced there successfully,
but the natives only would profit by it.
You see the tabor standard is so low thnt
it is impossible to attempt to raise it. The
heat there is enervating. In the heat of
day they close the stores and business
is suspended. A white man can stand
the climate, but the chances would be
against him. If anybody has an idea that
the Philippines are going to prove a gold
mine for our country let them lose it.
Capital will realize whatever benefit
might accrue â not labor. As for making
the natives citizens of our country 1 think
the idea is outrageous.
SERGEANT FRANK BAKER, Com- I
i pany Mâ The population is unusually
large tor a country its size, but its na
tives are a crude race. In Manila there â 
) are many educated Filipinos. Some of
: thun live well and drÂ»ss exceedingly
! neat. A white man can live there if he
i has to, but for his own choosing it is a .
! poor country to live in. The idea of in- '
j troducing American labor customs is ridic
ulously absurd. They have their own
customs-, and it would take years to raise
their standard. The country itself is rich
; and productive, but at that I don't think
it would enrich a white man enough to
compensate for the inconvenience and
hardships he would have to endure on
account of the country's peculiar weather
conditions. In the daytime it is everlast
ingly hot, so hot in fact that the natives
do much of their running around at night
and early in the morning. They do most
of their packing on their backs. Of courne
if horses and modern farming implements
: were imported there the work would be
much easier. I don't think the islands
will benefit the masses financially. It
may prove a gold mine for capitalists.
SERGEANT F. L. HULL. Company M
âThe inlands are thickly populated and
most of the land is cultivated. In fact :
every bit that we came across was laid
out in corn fields or sugar cane or ric*
patches. The opportunities for obtaining
land I know nothing about. I presume
a man could buy, land there, hut I don't
think there is much desirable land there :
now that is not under cultivation. The
priests own much of the land. Labor is
cheap and the introduction of our labor

asserts his belief that the grape-grower
and wfnemak'T will be benefited by enter
ing into the contract and says that he
lihs the hearty indorsement of all
branches of the industry in his enter
prise. His only doubt is that th*Â» wine
maker and dealer may fear that their
business will be hurt and that they m.iy
use their influence t<"> prevent producers
from signing. In concluding his letter Mr.
Crocker says:
'"1 have been the best friend of the
wlnemaker for the last two and a h.ilf
years, and I know of no reason why I
cannot deal with him as snon as I am
assured of enough grapes to make it
worth while taking up that part of the
details."
Producers who desire to do business
with Mr. <'ro>-kpr are given until the 9th
day pf September to sign and execute the
contract. Those best posted on the pres
ent condition and prospects of the indus
try are extremely anxious that th<* plan
should succeed, the theory being that
with the failure of the Winemakers" Cor
poration to reorganize and the rejection
of Mr. Crocker's proposition price cutting
would be inaugurated and the old days of

THE DOLLAR LIMIT.
LT POX all issues involved in the tax levy, whether
direct or indirect, there is but one course for
the Supervisors to take. They have pledged
themselves to the people to confine municipal ex
.tures within a revenue derived from a tax levy
not exceeding $l upon the $100 of an assessment of
$350,000,000 That pledge must be kept. No other
course can be taken that will be either expedient or
honest.
The pledge was not carelessly nor inconsiderately
given. Mayor Phelan had insistently maintained that
the city government could be efficiently supported on
revenues derived from taxation within the dollar
limit. A considerable body of citizens were convinced
by his arguments and it was in response to the popu
lar demand that both parties at the last municipal
election pledged their candidates to fix the tax levy
within that limit. The people rejected the Democratic
candidates and elected an overwhelming majority of
Republicans to the Board of Supervisors. The public
confidence thus shown in Republican fidelity must
not be betrayed.
The Finance Committee of the Supervisors has re
ported an estimate of appropriations for the year
which will be within the limit. That estimate has been
revised by the Merchants' Association and by Mayor
Phelan. The various estimates differ widely in many
respects, but all are within the limit. Out of the sug
gestions thus submitted the Supervisors must make
the best choice possible for the general good. It is
not demanded that either of them shall be adopted as
reported, but it is demanded that the point on which
they all agree, the dollar limit, shall be observed.
The Board of Supervisors which preceded the pres
ent one was dominated by a strong Democratic ma
jority. That majority was faithless to every pledge
and to every expectation of the people. As a conse
quence the voters turned to the Republicans at the
next election. The warning is therefore plain. If
the Republicans who now control the Board of Su
pervisors break faith with the people and prove false
to solemn pledges the party will suffer. If they stand
true and faithful Republicanism will once more have
proven its right to popular confidence.
The issue is not to be evaded. The people demanded
a dollar limit upon taxation, the Mayor recommended
it, the Merchants' Association indorsed it, the candi
dates for office were pledged to it. It must now be
given a full and fair trial. If a revenue so raised be
sufficient for all needs, it is time the people should
know it If it be insufficient, it will be well to have
that fact made known. Whatever the result may be
the Supervisors will stand blameless if they keep their
pledge, and will have the honor due to those who are
faithful to their promises to the people.

SOME PERSONALITIES.
BRIQADIER GENERAL HARRISON GRAY
OTIS of Los Angeles falls to calling names and
applies several epithets derived from the infre
: quent cesspools of the English language to The Call
j and its proprietor.
General Otis makes the mistake that is usual with
men of small caliber of thinking that a name changes
that to which it is applied. He has practiced this
upon himself. When he was gallivanting in the Phil
ippines, dressed in white clothes and a red sash and
other varieties, he thought that calling a thunder
: shower creek "the Rubicon" made him a Caesar when
! his horse waded it. In his mind's eye he saw rise
i around him all the pomp and circumstance that fol
; lowed the great Julius when he turned his back on
; his own province and led his legions upon Rome.
i But the resemblance between him and Caesar was no
! closer than that between a tailless tabby cat and a
j royal Bengal tiger.
His Rubicon dispatch was all that was heard of him
I as a soldier, and he soon followed it across the seas
to put of? his shining war harness and point to ele
: g&nt locations on his ample anatomy for scars that he
failed to get in battle. He has settled down to his
usual uncivil part in civil life and demands that all
men shall agree with him. or take a squirt from his
pen which does as little harm as a thrust from his
sword.
He has discovered that the owner of The Call has
"sugar interests" that will be destroyed by our perma
nent occupancy of the Philippines. He refers thereby
I to the manufacture of beet sugar in California, and the
size of his head is measured exactly by his rejoicing
that its destruction will injure The Call's owner. In
that he is mistaken, except that to destroy the beet
sugar industry by taking the Philippines will greatly
harm thousands- of farmers and incidentally hurt
everybody in the State, including this tin scrap Caesar
himself.
His jocund admission that this great and growing
interest is to be destroyed by the Philippine policy is
a substantial addition to the reasons why California !
should carefully consider that policy before indorsing
it. The Call has only tried to promote this examina
tion by its readers and the people whom it reaches and ]
iuiuences.
Perhaps the tin scrap Caesar of Los Angeles will
submit a statement of the compensating advantages
to the farmers of California which will follow the de
struction of the sugar-beet industry, out of the con
quest of the Philippines. What will the thousands of
. workingmen, thrown out of employment, find to do
, when the beet fields are not planted and the sugar
I mills grind no more? To what equally profitable
variation in their crops will farmers devote their |
land?? What equally profitable means of distributing \
the wages of labor among the merchants will be found
1 to take the place of what our Rubicon forder boasts j
' wil! be destroyed here by conquesting the Philippines? !
We can be amused by the perk and swagger of this |
strutting imperialist. He begs to assure us that "the
punishment of the Filipinos will continue as long as
a native is in open rebellion."
If the punishment were of the kind administered by
this pompous brigadier, the Filipinos would be a good
' risk in any life insurance company. His mere pres
ence in Luzon was the only offensive thing about
him, and as Los Angeles has to endure that the pun
â  ishment inflicted by him upon the people of the two
; places is just the same. His bellow citizens have a
. right to inquire why they are thus put on a level with
I the dusky skulkers who sniggered in their trenches
when- the waters of the Rubicon rose to the fetlocks
of his snorting charger. He says The Call is "gener
ally offensive, " which is more than he was as a soldier.
; He was then generally harmless and inoffensive. But
I when it comes to offensiveness as a man, it is best to
; get to windward of him.
Commenting on the funeral honors paid recently
at Trieste to Isaac Rusk, a jacky on the Olympi.i,
who died on the voyage home from Manila, the Aus
trian press agrees that no one in the Austrian navy
under the rank of a commander would have been
given such a send-off. The Austrian press seems to
forget that Dewey has a way of his own of doing
things.
THE COLLAPSE OF DEMOCRACY.
JAMES H. ECKELS, Comptroller of the Cur
rency during the second Cleveland administra
tion, has recently reviewed the effects of the
leadership of the free silver men upon the Democratic
party, and set forth the results in a manner sufficiently
terse and impressive to be of general interest. He
sums up in this way:
"First â The party given over to socialism in prin
ciples, leadership and following, with the consequent
result of loss in both leadership and following of ail
the business and independent elements of the country.
"Second â The falling away of the organization as
a national one, and the making of it almost wholly a
local one bent only on obtaining local standing and
local offices.
"Third â The elimination of it as a force in the
North and the lessening of its importance in the
South.
'"Fourth â The repudiation by it of all Democratic
principles, history and teaching concerning the money
question, the tariff, the country's courts and the pub
lic service.
"Fifth â The publicly making it the 'lying-in' asylum
of every element of discontent in the country, and the
making possible for political bastardy to claim Dem
ocratic parentage.
"Sixth â The depriving the country of the beneficent
effects of a strong, intellectual, conservative opposi
tion party at a time when grave questions of public
polity, far reaching in their effects, are being dealt
with by the party in power, without the restraining
influence that would follow if the Democratic party
stood for something more than mere agitation an-1
opposition."
No thoughtful and truthful student of American
politics will dispute the essential accuracy of that
summary. Under the leadership of Bryan, Democ
racy has achieved a complete political revolution
within itself, changing from a conservative party ro
one of the most extreme radicalism. Should it come
into power and undertake to carry out the wild theo
ries of its present leaders, it would produce a revolu
tion in the country. A Bryan administration would
be not four years of constitutional government, but
a socialistic experiment through four years of disas
ter, discord and turbulence.
So far as Northern Democracy is concerned, Mr.
Eckels sees no hope. The party in that section of the
country is hopelessly discredited and its abler leaders
have been forced into retirement. To the conserva
tism of Southern men, however, he turns with expec
tation. "It is within the power," he says, "of the
Democrats of the South to prevent a further abomina
tion of the party. If for no other reason than self
preservation they ought to step in and put an end to
the reign of .the socialist and Populist in the party
councils, for the continuation of it means finally their
own elimination, for a Democratic party of influence.
THE SAN FHAISCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, AUGUST 5, 189!).
purpose and character cannot exist in the South with
out an organization of the party of equal virility in the
North."
Mr. Eckels is not the only Northern Democrat
who has turned to the South for aid in the struggle
against Bryanism. but up to this time no such aid has
been forthcoming. Some oT the more influential pa
pers in the Southern States have indeed denounced
Bryanism, and a considerable number of influential
men have supported them, but the mass of Southern
Democrats appear to be as devoted to Bryan as ever.
From the present outlook it is not at all likely any
one will be able to prevent his renomination in 1900.
By its foolish and often corrupt alliances with Popu
lism, Democracy has been infected with socialism
and the virus must run its course to the end.
According to press dispatches, Champion Jim Jef
fries and Banker Isidore Wormser had numerous
heart-to-heart talks on the qualities that win success
during their voyage from New York to Southampton.
The dispatches are probably incorrect. Poker, not
hearts, was the game.
THE COURT-MARTIAL (\T RENNES.
BY all odds the most extraordinary feature of the
Dreyfus case is the convolution of mystery
within mystery that surrounds it. There have
been mistakes of justice before. There is not a laud
on earth where some innocent man has not been un
justly convicted of crime either by the machinations
of enemies, the mistakes of juries or the mischance of
circumstantial evidence. In the case of Dreyfus, how
ever, we have had all sorts of attendant sensations
involving the central wrong. There have been false
witness, forgeries, suicides, and even suggestions of
murder done in military prisons.
This characteristic of the case continues to mark
with mystery the approaching court-martial at
Rennes. The case submitted to that court by the
Court of Cassation is a very simple one, being limited
to the question of the authenticity of the famous bor
derau and the delivery to a foreign power of the docu
ments therein specified. If the court-martial confine
itself to those issues the proceedings need not be
complex nor long. Evidence submitted to the Court
of Cassation convinced that august body of? Judges j
that Dreyfus did not write the one and therefore could
not have delivered the documents. The court-martial
has, therefore, an opportunity to close the matter
promptly, flo justice to Dreyfus and husn the scandal.
For some mysterious reason, however, it seems
probable the court-martial will not take the easy way
out provided for it by the Court of Cassation. Re
ports from Paris imply the military judges will push
the investigations to the limit and reopen the whole
case. If this were done in an open trial, the course i
would be commendable, but it appears likely the court
will be secret and the results of the examinations will |
be known only to the judges. Is it any wonder that
under such circumstances the case should continue to
be not only a Parisian sensation, but a matter of pro
found interest to the whole civilized world?
General Mercier is quoted as having said recently: ;
"Certainly Dreyfus will be convicted again. Either j
he is guilty or I am; and. I shall prove him to be a
traitor." From that statement, it is argued, Mercier j
will claim to have confidential information of the guilt
of Dreyfus and will demand a secret investigation.
It is even said he will involve the German 1 Govern
ment in the affair, and thus force the court-martial to
secrecy for the purpose of avoiding an international
controversy. Such are reported to be the tactics of
the military ring, and the delay in holding the court
at Rennes goes far to confirm the report.
It is to be noted, however, there is a strong ele
ment in France that is desirous of settling the issue
by the simplest and promptest method. The Paris
Herald says:
"If the Court of Cassation, a? it was entitled to do
by statute, had returned a verdict of annulation sans
renvoi, the Dreyfus affair would by this time have
been simply a matter of 'ancient history,' and, in like '
manner, if the Rennes court-martial, avoiding danger
ous ambitions, confines its investigations within the
limits prescribed by the Court of Cassation, the ap- j
peasement, which seems to recede the more the matter !
is investigated, may shortly become an accomplished
fact. There can be no doubt that the Waldeck-Rous
seau Ministry- desires nothing so much as 'appease
ment and reconciliation,' and if, in carrying out its
cwn views, it emancipates the country from the tyr
anny of a certain press it will have deserved well of
the nation and the republic."
General Mercier, France's former Minister of War,
says: ''Either Dreyfus is guilty or I am." The world
at large will have no difficulty in picking the male
factor.
A COMMERCIAL MUSEUM.
Â» 'ROM the movement undertaken by the Mer
chants' Association to establish in this citya Com
mercial Museum along the lines of that which
lias proven so successful in Philadelphia much good is
to be expected. The association has accomplished so
much in the past there can be little doubt of its ability
to achieve the new undertaking if it find anything like
a sufficient responsiveness from the general public.
The value of such museums has been tested by the
experiment in Philadelphia, and the results have been
gratifying to the promoters. It must be borne in
mind, however, that such a venture cannot be widely
useful if undertaken on a small scale. To build up
her museum Philadelphia has sent agents to every
country in the world to gather up articles illustrating
the industrial needs of various peoples. Thus a manu
facturer can go to the museum in Philadelphia and
learn what kind of machinery, implements, clothing,
luxuries or other articles are in demand in any notable
commercial center of the globe.
A similar museum in San Francisco should include
in its scope at least an exhibit of the commercial needs
of all countries fronting upon the Pacific Ocean. It
should show what species of articles and what varieties
of them are in demand along the Pacific coast of
America, throughout the islands of Australasia and
among the swarming populations of the Orient.
Energetic agents will have to be kept at work and
considerable sums of money will be required to main
tain the exhibits up to date, but the amount will be
more than repaid by the profits resulting to manu
facturers, to merchants and to the community gen
erally.
It is stated the museum suggested for this city will
be aided by the co-operation of that in Philadelphia.
It is quite probable the aid thus given will increase
with the increasing expansion and activity of the two,
for they will be in no sense rivals. Each can accom
plish much more by working together than by work
ing separately, and with a greater economy. Thus the
prospect not only of present help but of the continued
co-operation of the great institution in Philadelphia
is well assured, and that fact, taken together with the
confidence so justly reposed in the enterprises of the
Merchants' Association, ought to sufficiently encour
age the public as to render the establishment of the
museum a matter of but a comparatively short time.
FACTS ABOUT WAR CORRESPONDENTS.
Editor of The Call: The San Francisco
Chronicle for July 27, 1599, contains an
editorial entitled "Generals and Corre
spondents" which contains more mistakes
and mischievous falsehoods per square
inch than can often- be found in any
respectaÃle newspaper.
It begins with saying that the Ameri
can people are being misled by war cor
respondents who want to make reputa
tions. Here are two misstatements of
alleged facts. The people are not misled.
The American people are not easily mis
ledânever are, as a whole, long at a
timeâ and speedily sift the facts from a
mass of falsehoods.
Next, the correspondents alluded to are
not troubled about their reputations.
These were established in nearly every
instance before they were sent to Ma
nila, and the men were selected because
of their well earned reputations.
Next "censorship has been established
and maintained â¢ * * ever since war
correspondence was invented. During tne
Civil War General Sherman threatened
to hang Whltelaw Reid, correspondent of
the New York Tribune, and turned Murat
Halstead out of camp in the most sum
mary manner."
Whitelaw Reid was never in thÂ» army
as a correspondent of the New lork
Tribune under any commander. At the
battle of Shiloh he was the correspondent
of the Cincinnati Gazette over ; the sig
nature of "Agate," and got into such dis
favor for telling the truth about certain
regiments and regimental commanders
(and these chiefly from his own State)
that he never cared to return to that dep
artment. The Gazette sent him to
Washington city. His last army corre
spondence was, I think, from the field of
Gettysburg. He always took very high
rank as a truthful correspondent. The
Chronicle dare not deny this.
Again: "He (Sherman) turned Murat
Halstead out of camp in. the most sum
mary manner." There is not a single
word of truth in this statement. Hal-
Btead was editor and proprietor of the
Cincinnati Commercial, confined closely
at home, was never a war correspondent
for any paper in the Civil War. He may
have visited army lines once or twice
and sent home some editorial notes, prior
to the fall of 1862, but he was never at
Grant's or Sherman's headquarters after
that date to my certain knowledge. He
was actively intriguing for Grant's re
moval from command down to and in
cluding the siege of Vicksburg. This I
will prove if any one denies it.
Again: "General Grant also made an
example of another famous correspond
ent. In each case where the presence
of a newspaper writer was tolerated his
letters and telegrams were rigidly super
vised."
Here are two or three falsehoods in a
single Dtence. General Grant never
sent but one correspondent from his
command. This one was a brother-in
law to Wilbur F. Storey, the great editor
of the Chicago Times, who had been re
peatedly warned as to sending contra
band news of war. General Grant never
assumed, or sought to exercise, the
slightest censorship over letters or tele
grams from the army from Cairo to
Appomattox and Raleigh. He took the
only defensible ground for an army com
mander in the very outset. He pro
claimed scores of times that he had
neither time nor inclination to exercise
any censorship. He notified all corre
spondents who approached him on that
subject that they had his full permis
ANTELOPES TRAINED TO BEAT TROTTING RECORDS.
ANEW YORK sportsman is at present training a pair of antelopes in trotting
harness which he expects will considerably lower the world's best trotting
record. The antelope has never before been considered seriously as a
racing machine, but those familiar with them b.elieve that they can be
controlled by careful training as well as a horse, and are capable of won
derful bursts of speed. '
The owner of the first team of racing antelopes is Donald Burns, who is fa
mous as an animal trainer of wide experience. Mr. Burns is at present running
his trained antelopes on a track n?ar his home at Babylon, L. 1., and expects to
have them in condition to take part in regular track racing events some time thi3
fall When Mr. Burns was seen last week he expressed himself as confident that
his strange racers would better the world's trotting record of 2:03 by from tuur to
six seconds. ,
It has been found in training this pair of antelopes that their peculiar nervous
ness or wildnesa gives them an immense amount of life or spirit on the race
course The average antelope, if its training be commenced early enough, ran oe
brought to mind the whip and rein when about two years old, and their racing
life after that is about the same as ihat of a horse. They run very low, as the
expression goes, the body falling several inches when they move at their besf
speed while their long, thin legs move with great regularity and evenness.
Their stride is somewhat different from that of a trotting horse, the step be
ing slightly longer, but it is sufficiently like to allow them to enter a regular
trotting race. Another peculiarity of antelopes is that they can only travel at
their best pace for comparatively short distances. In their natural wild state
they cannot sustain one of their spurts of speed for more than a half to three
quarters of a mile, and it is only by careful training that they can be made to
cover a mile.
This is due to the fact that they are naturally very short-winded, and their
muscles are too slight to withstand any long exertion. Their speediness is due
to the fact that they weigh from three to five hundred pounds less than a
horse, while their legs, with comparatively the same reach of stride, are lighter
and more nimble.
' The sight of a pair of antelopes with their slender bodies and long horns
trotting peacefully about the country has naturally attracted a great deal of at
tention. The residents of Babylon, L. I. have decided that this curious means
of conveyance is merely the freak of some rich man, and the fact that they are
actually training to beat a world's record with much promise of success has
been kept secret.â Philadelphia Times.

The Other Side of the Story.
Sacramento Record-Union.
And now- it turns out, after all the hys

It is an admitted fact that the efficiency
of an army depends more upon us intel
ligence than its physical development.
Tho press is a great educational factor
among soldiers. Our soldiers are news
paper readers. An army of American
citiz.-ns would be damaged more in its
morale by withholding daily newspapers
tilled with army newa than by being
placed on half rations in the fac? of a
victorious enemy.
It may be considered a certainty that
our citizen soldiers will soon rebel against
any constituted authority which shuts
from them sources of public information.
The highest interest of any administra
tion of any republican Government,
namely self-preservation, must therefore
always embrace the widest diffusion of
news and information affecting its wel
fare. In prolonged wars the existence of
any Government comes to depend upon
the loyalty nf troops and people to the
national cause. S. CADWALLADER.

The list of nnmes for positions on the

that 'or the primary election there is no I

their services, though those serving at i

at the general election.
The Republicans are still short a few j
names and the Democrats are probably (
100 short. Mayor Phelan, it is said, is j
using his utmost endeavors to have the i
vacancies filled by Monday night with j
good, willing Democrats.
It is somewhat surprising that there
should be so many vacancies in the Demo
cratic list at the present time. The Mayor ,
ought to do some hustling around to-day
and send in before sundown the names j
of good, capable Democrats to supply the
existing vacancies. Further delay might. j

Friends of Gavin McNab and Jasper Mc-
Donald were roaring against the Examiner |
yesterday because that papiar opened Its
coluair.s to Sam Rainey's man, George
Gallagher of the Thirty-eighth District.
The followers of the Committee of One
Hundred assert that Gallagher is no
friend of Phelan; but on the contrary is
an enemy who withdrew from the first \
convention that minated Phelan for ,
Mayor and joined in a movement to defeat
Jimmie at the pulls. It is further held
up linst Gallagher that he gave aid and j
comfort to the Supervisors who were
ousted from office by Judgi Wallai â¢ and
restored to power by the Supreme Court.
The further assertion is made by the I
: llowers of Gavin McNab and Jasper Mc-
Donald that Gallagher is now to the front
for the purpose of beating thÂ« daylights
out of a ticket which parades such men
as ex-Judge William T. Wallace, Clarence ;
McKinstr; . Colonel Thomas K. Barry, P.
F. Butler and Bert Schleslnger. . The \
friends of McNab and' McDonald do not
hesitate to declare that the Examiner is \
at heart an enemy of the Mayor, and only I
awaits the signal to knife him.
The Democrats who are beginning to
appreciate the fact that the Examiner is
not a success in boosting Phelan were |
told by The Call some time ago that
Hearst's regard for Phelan was too Insig- ;
nificant to be measured, and that Phelan s
contempt for Hearst was bigger than the
Examiner's istimated circulation.
The publican clubs which were or- ;
ganized under the auspices of the Repub
lican County Committee have finished
their work of lecting delegate tickets to
be voted for at the primary election. Many
Â»od men have been brought forward. At <
County < 'ommi headquarters last :
night "the prediction was made that the I
tickets so selected would win at the polls
next Tuesday. The regular organization
claims an enrollment of 11,000 Republican \
voters.
The Phelan mass-meeting under the j

When Mayor Phelan. Judge Wallace and !
Jasper McDonald filed in from the rear i
and took th< Ir assigned places on the plat- I
form the band played "We Won't Go
Home Till Morning." Despite the threat '.
of the music many of the people present
did go home before the meeting was over. ,
Democrats who went to the temple to
hear Phelan and Wallace no doubt ex- â¢
pected that the old-time bosses, Buckley !
and Ralney, would be Hayed alive; but i
the advertised stalwarts never as much !
as mentioned a boss by name. Reference i
was made to Canada, and the Impression !
was conveyed to the audience that the !
speaker had In mind the flight of Rainey I
or Buckley to that country. The allusion j
was so mild and remote that the Demo
cratic friends of Ralney and Buckley were
not offended.

There was a full attendance of Republi

put the minority report to Cne house. It'
was claimed that he did not give the men
who advocated the majority report a ;

DISCUSSED THE STATE
FORESTRY QUESTION
DR. PINCHOT, DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE.
A SMALL and informal meeting of those interested in the forestry
question was held in the rooms of 'he Press Club last evening for the
purpose of meeting Dr. Pinchot, head of the Division of
Forestry of th< Department of Agriculture of the United States,
who arrived in the city yesterday from Oregon.
Those present were: Congressman Julius K.-.hn. Professor C. H. Shinn of the
University of California. Professor Charles Emory Smith of Stanford Uni
versity; J A. Fllcher. secretary of thi State Board of Trade; E. A. Denicke.
president of the Mechanics 1 Instant.: Surveyor General J. A. Gleaves and
W. \V. Fowler of Fresno.
Secretary Filcher Introduced Dr. Pinchot, who spoke for a few minutes
Âr the object of his mission to this coast. He said that though ho had been
some time on the coast he had just begun to realize the magnitude of the
work before him. The forestry question was one winch excited more tnter
â¢st In this state than anywhere else in the Union with the possible exception
of the State of New York. At present he had one man In the Sierras studying
the timber question there, but such was the size of our State that it would
take a number of men several years to properly set the forestry question well
in hand and prepare comprehensive maps ..f the entire country which could
be used as matters of absolute refer*
Connected with the forestry question, Dr. Pinchot said, were the ques
tions of sheep grazing, forest tires, destruction of the forests by ill-advised
cutting and the Irrigation question. All of these matters would require care
ful looking into and would probably result in the Department of Agriculture
: idviÃing Congress to take some step that would result in our trees being
1 effectually protected from utter demolition. Dr. Pinohot closed by saying that
I resent the division of whirh he Is the head is seriously handicapped- by a
lack of sufficient funds to enable it to properly carry out the work it has
mapped out for Itself.
Dr Pli hot came Professor Shinn, who presented the synopsis
of a bill which would be put into the hands of our Congressional delegation
next fall It provides for ihe appropriation ol 12300 annually to five differ
' colleges in the United States to be utilized by said colleges for th: fur
thering of th- study of forestry in their curriculum. The colleges to receive
the donation will be decided upon Dy the Department of Agriculture and it
is expected that the Legislature of the States to which the appropriations
will go will supplement the appropriation by a like one out of their own
Following Professor Shinn Congressman Kahn, Professor Smith and the
other gentlemen present spoke, each adding some opinion to the matter under
discussion. The meeting was purely an informal one and got up merely to
allow those interested in the forestry of our State an opportunity to meet
Dr. Pinchot.

support and maintain. He also upheld
it because it did away with bosses.
Tht speaker set the ball a-rolling by
eulogizing Mr. Phelan. He considered
that all should be happy that a gentleman
has been found who is ready to devote .
his talents, youth, ability ami life to the
utrbuiMing of the municipality. liv said
he was sure that Mr. Phelan would be

with a fund of anecdote, puns and eulo

he had endeavored to abide by th<s plat

he stepped down at .the end of his term |
it would be with the consolation t.ir.t he
had at least done his duty. This state
ment found merit in the minds of hiÂ« is
teners and they loudly applauded -him.
Colonel T. F. Barry followed with a |
lengthy oration on the party, the charter. :
the. Mayor and the other Democratic
members seated on the platform. The
speech proved too lengthy, and time wa3
called on him by many who were anxious
to hear the Mayor.
Assessor Washington Dodge was given
an ovation when introduced. He modestly
spoke of his own services to the city,
dwelt on good government, highly praised
the charter, and concluded by saying that j
with it In operation and James D. Phelan
at the helm of the ship of state this city
would have the finest government it has
1 ever had in its history. He paid a beau- :
: tiful tribute to Franklin K. Lane, the
City and County Attorney, and introduced I
him to the audience as one who has ren- J
dered untold good for the city. ;
Mr Lane's speech was necessarily short i
but was said to be the best of the evening. |
He advised his hearers what their duties !
were as citizens, and his strong points
struck home, Judging by the applause
which punctuated the speech.
Supervisor Deasy gracefully withdrew in

Honor the Mayor.
A. tremendous shout rilled the building
when he stepped forward to deliver his
address. Almost half the audience arose
to its feet and cheered him and waved
hats and canes in his honor. The cheer- ;
ing lasted nearly five minutes, and when
it subsided Mr. Phelan began his address.
He spoke rapidly, as he knew his audi- ;
ence was tired. In quick, sharp, rounded |
sentences he gave advice and warning to j
his audience. He felicitated it on the i
large attendance at the outset, and hav
ing ingratiated himself into the good feel- i

' Company was raised and that the differ- j
ent capitalists were induced to put their \
money in the enterprise. It was he who
brought the necessity of such a water
way atroiigly before the American people,
and it is to his influence and energy that I
is due the passage of the Nicaragua canal
bill twice through the Senate.
When seen in his apartments at the
j Palace last night the Senator said:
â¢'The necessity for a short water route
from the Atlantic to the Pacific is greater
to-day than ever it was. Not only from
a commercial standpoint has this . fact
I been demonstrated, but from a strategic ,
j standpoint as well. Had the United States j
i owned such a thing as a Nicaragua canal !
i during the last war with Spain they I
would have â  considered the $150,000,000 j
j spent in its construction as a piece of
very great economy. The administration
, is in favor of such an undertaking being
: put through with all possible speed, and |
: the great majority of the American peo
ple are of the same mind. Twice has ,
the bill passed the Senate, but each time I
â  has it failed to pass the House because
I of the efforts of the opposition and the '
influence that those opposed to the canal j
wielded with the Speaker. Could the bill !
I ever have got before the House it would I
i have passed by an easy three-fourths.
But it wati never allowed a day upon
: which to come up. Every time it wav
j brought forward it was denied a hearing ,
!by tne autocratic Speaker, and conse- j
] quently the wishes of the administration, !
; the benate and the people went for
1 naught.
â¢â¢'i his opposition, which, though small
In numbers, is very powerful in influence,
is composed of those who got from ten
: to twelve millions out of the clutche* of ;
the thieves of Paris uncl sunk it a<ai:i in
the same scheme that those rascals made
their money out ofâ the Panama canal.
! They now went to get their money back
from ihe Government of this country,
and will devote every energy to the de
l feat of the Nicaragua canal project until
this end is accomplished.
! "Then again, they are aided and abetted '
! by C. P. Huntington, who sees in the j
project a loss of power over this country
which he now holds at his mercy and a !
tremendous reduction of the freight, rates
that have made him wealthy at rhe. ex
; pense of the fruit raisers and farmers of
i the Pacific Coast.
"Why, we have a bigger population in
the State of New YorK than you have i
contained in the whole Pacific Coast from
Central America to the Alaskan line. )
What is the reason of this? Why, simply I
that while your country is the most fcr- i
I tile and fecund on earth you cannot make
! a decent living out of your lands for the
I simple reason that all your profits are ;
! eaten up .by the rates you are forced to
j pay In order to market your goods. San
I Francisco li farther away from the tr.ar
i kr>ts ol the world than uny Other civilized
' city on the face of the glohe.
"The Nicaragua canal will surely some
I day become an accomplished tact. It may .
i not be when you or I am alive, but it will
surely be sooner or later. I have spent
tea years of my life In furthering the I
project. 1 have spent much money, made !
many spÂ«Â»eoh*Â»*Â». written ihousanis ot
woids and traveled thousands of miles in
Its Interests. The Government s.iid It
wanted to construct It Itself.
; A- to the Philippines', I think mu-h of
the present trouble ' o<njld have been
i avolned if the proper diplomacy had br-en
used at tirst. Bf> that ns it may, we have
now acquired them and we must keep
them at least until we have established
some sort of law and order In them. The
treatment that Otis accorded Agiiinaido l
1 and his follower* was surely prompted
by the >rders he received from the Gov
ernment at home. There are mauv peo
ple in the East that deplore the mistakes
that have brought about the present sit
uation. But since they have been made
the sentiment of the country is over- I
whelmlngly In favor of living up to them.
That what was done was done with the ,
best possible intent, no one doubts tur an :
i Instant. In public a? well as in private I
â  concerns the aftersicht Is sometimes b*t
; ter thnn the foresight."

days. before leaving for his home.

TRIED TO HAVE
CASES AGAINST
THEM QUASHED
McPherson Gang to
Be Tried.
A strong but unsuccessful effort wan
made yesterday by the "Brick" McPher
son gang of alleged conspirators to nave
tne proceedings atainst them riuashe:!
when their cases came up for trial before
Judge Treadwell. The effort, however,
failed of its purpose, as the Judge ordered
the ca*es against Smoot, McPheraon,
Clisham and '.Davis" to be taken up next
week.
When the cases of McPhersun and (.lis
hani were called Isaac N. Thorne, who
had sworn to thu original conipiaims
against them, liled an affidavit stating
that he Leiieved the conviction of the de
fendants impossible under the law, and
he desired to withdraw his complaints,
whieli he said were prepared under the
common law of England. Section 11 1.0 or
the Penal Codo provides that tnÂ« oe
lendants cannot be convicted if the raise
pretense was expressed in language un
accompanied by a laise token or writing
subscribed to by tne delendants unless)
the pretense be proved by two witnesses
or that of one witness and corroborating
circumstances." Thorne said he was un
able to comply with these provisions.
Judge Treadwell recognized % tne fact
that the law as stated was correct, hut
he did not deem it his duty to dismiss tnÂ»i
case and wanted the case to bo un im
mediately, but finally postponed the hear
ing of McPheraon and Clisnam uni.il Mon
day morning. Attorney Wilson attempted
to have McPherson's bail reduced, but
Judge Treartwell was obdurate, i-a'.er in
the day \\ Uson sued out a writ of nb.beas
corpus, which was made returnable this
morning before Judge Dunne.
The next move by the defendants also
met with a signal setback. Mrs. Carroll
also refused to sign her complaint against
E N Smoot, and his attorney asked that
he he released. The motion was aenlcd
by Judge Treadwell, who set the bearing
for next Wednesday, and took xjcasion
to say : "
"Mrs Carroll must come to this court
and testify in this case. I want to see
what kind of work is going on. Mis.
Carroll came to me and insisted that
Smoot be arrested. I desire to investigate
the matter." ...
The case of Thomas R. Clisham, jointly
accused with McPheraon, also went j)ver
until next Wednesday. Attorney Mack
asktd that Clishani be allowed to Â»o back
to Portland, saying that the prosecution
had no intention of pressing the chaises
against him, but simply wanted to, use
him as a witness. Clisham, he said,
would voluntarily return to testify.
The case of the mythical "Thomas R.
Davis," charged with embeulemenl, will
also be heard Wednesday.
Auld Arrested.
R. L, Auld of the Auld-Cook Company,
318 Pine street, was arrested yesterday
afu-rnoon on a warrant, but wus immedi
ately released on his own recognizance.
The Auld-Cook Company's affaird have
been badly mixed. The corporation was
urbanized about two years ago fur the
purpose of carrying on a general stock
brokerage business. Cook and Auld were
formerly in the employ of the late C. P
Harris who failed for over $100. "n) ir. 1895
and was prosecuted criminally by credit
ors up to the time fif his death.
It 'vill be rtmembered that Harris was
1., pleged in his office hy a lot of women
armed with hatpins and brickbat 3.
A Ferry-Boat as a Dam.
The hull of the old ferry boat Alameda >
is to 1 c used as a dam to restrain the How I
<,f the tide, which, washing through, the >
old slough at the end of the lon* Hlrli ;
street trestle in Alameda. has time and ;
again caused the roadbed to sink and
leave the rails suspended in the air. En
gineer Curtia of the Southern Pacific, in
an effort to prevent this, is going 'o try |
the experiment of filling the hull of tho t
old boat with stone and sinking it at the
entrace of the slr.ugh. He thinks this |
will In a great measure remedy the I
trouble by placing an obstruction to the

EASTERN MARKETS
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, Aug. 4.â To-day's stock mar
ket was largely devoted to dealings in a few
industrial specialties. Under cover of the
â trength in a few industrials there was a
nark- : tendency to realize in the railroad
list, but the selling pressure there was not
heavy and offers decreased as prices declined.
Union Pacific was subjeot to pressure by un
oonfirmed rumors of a strike on its line. The
stnek broke 14 points on rather liberal, offer
ings and closed at a net loss of a point. The
preferred declined \- The chief movement of
the day was* in Tobacco st ks and Tennessee
Coal. American Tobacco gained an extreme
1 pointÃ, Continental Tobacco 3%, the preferred
hKi and Tennessee Coal 2%. Late in the day
prices of t!;.-s.' were suddenly let down from
I'd to 24 points, apparently with the purpose
ot shaking off weak followers of the bull
movement- The rumor of a great combination
of coal and iron interests in the South was
added to those recently current to explain the
Tennessee Coal ovement. The vigorous ad
vance of this stock begot some sympathetic
strength in other stocks on the same indus
try. Colorado Fuel. Federal Steel, American
Pmeiting and a number of other stocks ad
vanced from a fraction to over a point.
Sugar was heavy most of the day on account
of the shading of prices in some grades of
refined sugar. The local traction stocks
ehowed weakness throughout, and Consolidated
Gas lost 34 per cent net. Rock Island's June
statement showing an increase in the surplus
after charges of nearly $97,000 compared with
last June failed to hold up the grangers. The
reported large demand for grain for export
was equally ineffective, and this group and
Atchison preferred drifted downward. Some
depression wa-s reflected here from London on
account of the outlook for dearer money there,
and there were some eporta of money trouhlPh
in Berlin. The coming holiday in London and
expected dullness In New York prompted the
closing up of many accounts. To-day's spec
ulative leaders closed feverish and unsettled,
but the general tone was firm at the last.
Kansas City, I'ittshurg and Gulf firsts rose 34
per cent. ' "
There was some activity In mortgages of
Southwestern railroads and In Rope and Twine
Incomes at mixed changes. Total sales,
$1,808,000.
United States 4s advanced M and the 5s VÂ»

: BRADSTREET'S FINANCIAL REVIEW.
I NEW YORK, Aug. 4.- Bradstreefs financial j
review to-morrow will say: ;
\ At the beginning of the present week thÂ»re
1 was an apparent accession of fresh outside I
: ! speculative buying, but as the week progressed j
i this fell off again and the market reverted to
1 I Its former condition of dullness. The profes
' j sional interests which are responsible for the \
i greater part of transactions generally seemed :
, inclined to bull the market, but this attitude :
was in a certain degree modified by the con
-1 ' tinued firmness of the money market, which
I holds Its recent advance and gives no sign of
; enlarged supplies or a renewal of its former ex
-1 I treme ease. There has been, indeed, no strin- I
: gency and fears that the needs of the crop
1 I moving season, together with the activity of j
' general business, may result In decided scar
i city of funds, are not seriously considered. It
' â  is however, admitted that extremely low rates
1 1 for money with which to carry securities is at
'â  jan end. and the 44 per cent rate . for time j
'â  I money, which has taken the place of the re
: I cent figure of 3 per cent or less for such accom- I
! modations causes conservatism In regard to
! speculative buying of securities, which al
-1 j ready sell at higher prices. The break in for- i
1 eign exchange this week. indicating that this I
'â  country retains its position as a creditor nation :
I and that gold may be expected to come this j
' i way from Europe in the autumn, was regard
' ! ed with favor, but had no practical effect on
! I speculative sentiment or activity. The very !
1 I favorable character of the June statements of
1 several large railroad systems and the con
tlnuance of increases in the gross earnings of I
1 ' their current weeks keep up the confidence j
of holders In the granger and other properties,
checking any tendency to liquidate. There haa, \
1 however, been much less disposition to manipu- 1
I late properties of this kind in the face of 1
1 ! higher money and th<s attentions of like nature i
, j have been again directed to the Industrial
: stocks and specialties, though the success of â 
I efforts to once more attract public interest in j
i them is as yet not succeeding. The principal j
: I bear factor outside of the money market sltu
â  i ation was the appearance of yellow fever at a
, i Southern port. This led to some selling of
, =hares on railroads considered likely to suffer i
. from the outbreak of a genuine epidemic, but
I the needlessness of fear on this score soon be- I
, came apparent and deprived the matter of
much influence. The subsidence of the recent '
t strikes and the comparative freedom from â 
j ! symptoms of further labor troubles .has been ;
3 : noticed by the "street" as a favorable sign.
i ' London took little part in this maTket, though I
! at the beginning of the week there was some 'â 
â . buying of our stocks there, said to be on or
j j rier from this side. It iÂ« noted that recent
, 1 large shipments of American securities from '
\ London to New York were partly due to the ;
, Imposition of new am! increased stamp duties |
1 ! by the British Government upen transfers of i
: stock.
' I BRADSTREETS' ON TRADE CONDITIONS.
1 NEW YORK, Aug. 4.â Bradstreefs to-mor
â¢ row will say:
' All conditions indicate the maintenance of
â¢ general trade and industry in an unprecedent
ed midsummer volume. Especially Indicative
â¢ of this are the continued very heavy bank
clearing returns, largely increased railroad
earnings, reflecting a traffic in grain and mer
! chandise generally far in excess of a. year
Â£ I ago; reports of activity in numerous lines of
I manufacturing: industry, notably in all
i branches of iron and steel and kindred lineo,
woolen g<-.ods, boots and shoes and cotton
I goods and advices from leading markets of a
j satisfactory opening of the regular fall de
i ! mand. with heavy shipments of goods on or
i ders. â¢ ..
With the exception of good products, the
i price situation is generally one of maintained
, strength, advanoea being most numerous In the
THE SAN FRANCISCO CAI/L, SATURDAY, AUGUST 5, 1899.
line of manufactured goods or In" raw ma
terials for manufacturing industry. Cereals
are all lower on the week, reflecting the gen
[ erally favorable crop outlook and also some
indifference as regards foreign buying of
wheat, though the export demand for corn has
been apparently stimulated by recent price re
actions. All classes of Iron and steel are
either firmly held or tending upward, notable
in this respect being all grades of pig iron
and .steel rails, structural material and bar
iron and steel. Other metals are rather quiet
er, and tin shows some reaction from the
high price reached last week. Wool is' still
moving upward in sympathy with improved
demand for the manufactured article, but buy
ing is more closely confined to manufacturers,
speculative dealing being apparently less no
ticeable. Cotton is steady pending further de
velopments in the crop situation. The an
| thracite coal trade appears, to be well under
control and advances are reported maintained. :
Western and Northwestern trade advices tell
Of expanding fall trade. Shipments on fall ac
! count rrom Minneapolis tax the facilities of
i the jobbing houses. Lumber is firm and scarce
at that center, and advices as to crop condi
tions point to stories of damage by storms and
hot winds being in some respects exaggerated
Increased demand is noted at Chicago and
business with jobbers Is reported never better
at this season of the year. The price of bar
i and pig iron Is up. as are all steel plates

DUN'S REVIEW OF TRADE.
NEW YORK. Aug. 4.-R. O. Dun & Co. In
! their weekly review of trade, will say: July
i failures have been smaller than In any month
of which there is record, excepting May. and
trading failures smaller than in any other
month. Surprising contrasts are shown by
i comparison of small with large failures in dlf
. fer-nt years, and in no class of business wtth
out some large failures not attributabl- to
present Influences does the aggregate equal the
financial nower
of this â¢ wntry. The Hank of England vir
tually admits that it cannot draw from New
York the gold it needs; exchange moves to the
importing point; over $1,000,000 "arts from
: Sydney to San Francisco; London's net buj lng
of stocks has been 40.000 shares and bills against
produce to be shipped are very heavy. _ Âo t
. This describes a revolution in finances cot
unlike that in Industries. Europe searching for
1 wool here at 50c scoured and for pigiron at *J>
a ton. with a vast demand for both materials,
: haÂ« fallen upon the commercial world, wnlcn
this country alone appears able to meet for its
own needs. Wool shipments from Australia
have been surprisingly little below those of last
year but Europe talks of a wool famine while
thiÂ« country has on hand a year's consumption
or more besides this year's clip, and prices
are not yet as high as they were in February
of laÂ«t year, when stocks were many million
pounds larger. Scarcity of Bessemer pig has
caused two steel works at Plttsburg to stop a
day or two and $21 25 to $21 75 has been paid
for 30 000 tons, with $17 75 for gray forge and a
rise of 50c In local coke at Chicago. It is no
' longer a question whether enough can be had
after a while; the trouble is about early sup
plies Orders for plates and structural work
are refused at most points, mills having work
far ahead and for sheets also at Philadelphia,
though new and large mills make things easier
iin plates at Plttsburg. liar iron is in great
i demand instead of steel, being $3 to $4 cheaper,
and new Eastern mills set all the business
they want. The magnitude of the demand, in
spite of high prices, is everywhere a surprise.
Once more Connellsvllle eclips.es itself, with
only 550 ovens idle and 191.541 tons of coke pro
duced for the week. Tin was raised by London
to the breaking point. 33c here being followed
by 31% c. but copper was llrm at lSVic for lake,
though the London visible supply reached 33.800
tons, the largest pince 1597. Lead was quiet
at ?4 60.
\\ hf at weakens, yielding lc. with the aston
ishing receipts at the West of 4.734.363 bushels

potent in that regard is the shipment of 4,003.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO. Aug. 4.â The Liverpool market
was the guiding star of wheat traders to-day.
' A real surprise came from the English mar
j ket, quotations there being about '/id higher, a
condition not looked for in view of the de
cline here yesterday. This was afterward ex- \
. plained on the ground of advanced, ocean â ,
I freight rates, but it had its effect on opening
prices here. September starting at 69Â»ic, an
i advance of V c. A momentary dip to t>9',ic. fol- ,
i lowed, but good buying by short?, mostly lo- |
I cal, resulted in a gradual advance to MXÂ® \
' 69T4C, the highest point reached during the 1
session. Besides the strength shown by Liver
pool prospective buyers were encouraged by
I continued crop damage reports from the North- j
! west and by Snow's crop summary, which made ;
j he condition of spring wheat 85 per cent, or
â  five points less than June 1. This indicated a ;
! total crop of about 275,000,000 bushels, but in- â 
i terest in the market soon died out. The cash
'. demand was almost nothing and only a moder
ate demand was reported from the seaboard. j
The Northwest, which was a seller In this
j market, reported the flour trade quiet and the ;
I first rush of winter wheat apparently over. :
1 The buying demand dwindled to almost noth
i Ing during the middle of the session, and at- |
tempts to realize on early purchases were at- j
. tended with considerable difficulty. Septem-
I ber slowly declined to 69Â®69Hc and hung
', nr.nind that price until about noon, when the |
1 sudden strength of corn put some life into :
! wheat and resulted in a steady advance, j
j which was continued to the close. September t
â  advanced to 69%@69\c and closed at 69% c, an j
j advance of ',4c.
Corn was fairly active. At the opening the
, market was firm and higher on continued hot
: weather damage, reports. The cash demand
was excellent. Near the close the shorts went
to cover, bidding the market up rapidly. Sep
tember closed with a net gain of VÂ«V'
j Oats were quiet and fairly steady with other
' grains. September closed a shade higher.
Provisions were strong and active. The yel- ;
! low fever situation was more favorable, but j
i the strength was mostly from a sharp advance j
{in hog prices. Buying of all products was ;
I general and prices advanced steadily, the 1
i close being at about the top. At the close
September pork was 20c higher, lard 124 c and :
] ribs 15c higher.

I Harrison's circular says: "During the week
' there have been five arrivals of coal from
Washington, with 13.980 tons; one from British
Columbia 4442 tons, and two from Swansea,
5363 tons; tontal. 23,783 tons. There has been
j a much larger amount delivered to consumers â¢
i this week than has been received, so that
: stocks in yard have been eaten into somewhat.
; Shipments from the northern coast are light,
' as coal-carriers are unprocurable even at in
creased rates of freight; three-fourths of pur
locally owned colliers are temporarily away in
' Australia' and China carrying lumber, for '
which extreme raU-s are being paid. The War
Department is diverting a number of our coast
steamers which were formerly utilized for
transporting coal. A new departure will take
! place this month: the Wellington Coal Company :
1 will load the Colorado, now converted into a j
barge (the masts, etc., have been taken out),
! and will use one of their tugboats to tow her
; down This may he feasible at this season of
': the year; later on it will be a precarious ven
i ture
"Honolulu is still an active coal buyer, both i
: from British Columbia and Australia at ex
treme figures Charters have recently been
made from the north, which will make the
j landing cost at Honolulu fully $7 50 per ton.
1 and the outlook is high _ prices will rule for
i several months to come."

TENNIS EXPERTS IN
CHAMPIONSHIP GAMES
SOUTHAMPTON, L. 1., Aug. 4.â The i
semi-final matches In the championship j
singles of the Lung Island Tennis
tournament were . played on the
courts of the Meadow Club this !
morning. Whitman was unable to
work havoc against his opponent by
using his famous twist service. The Yule ;
champion had evidently made a stud of
how to successfully meet this stroke, and â¢'
he landed his racket fairly on the ball ai
most every time. In the majority of the
games the scores see-sawed between
ueuce and vantage before the national I
champion was able to pull them out.
After his clever work this morning
there an be no doubt that Allen excels
at side-line passing. He had his oppo- j
nent on the run from oue side of the court |
to the other trying to return the ball? j
that went cutting down the lines. Most i
of his points were scored by this sort cf j
play. In the final game of the match
there was a most brilliant rally by botn I
men, and the ball crossed the net more I
ihan twenty times before Whitman I
counted the' point by driving deep into
the Yale man's court. i
The match between Ware and Davis j
was a long one. Davis was very ragged j
in his net play, at which he Is famous, â¢
and he sent the easiest kinds of shots j
Into the net.
Whitman's victory over Davjs will
bring Whitman and Ware together for
the final and championship to-mo
The two old-time champio Henry Slo
cum and Howard Taylor, were defeated
in thf doubles by Winslow and Cod man,
the Longwood experts, who were paired
against them. The veterans were buc
cessful in taking the second set, hovr
ever, and felt that they had done wonders :
by scoring against the agst< rs. Wins- 'â 
low and Codman were very speedy and!
banged the ball over the net in t way
that bewildered the veterans and they
werp frequently unable to return. Tay
lor was much bett< r In his play than was .
Slooum, the tter being faulty to a de
gree. His most flagrant offense was his
inability to get his returns over the net.
The doubles are now finished up to the
semi-final round. The semi-final match
for doubles between Allen and McKit
trii k and Davis and Ward was well con
tested. McKittrick made repeated
"double faults" in his service and In
changing Bides with Allen during the I
play he seriously interfered with him and :
allowed the Harvard men to score four
straight games in the third set, after
which they pulled out. The match oc
cupied four houre of playing time and
the quartet of players are badly used up
to-night. Summary:

Archie Permien. Jakey's second.
Musa Bryam of Zanzibar, principal.
â Dalton, second to Bryam.
These four prize-fighters are in the City
Prison, and all but Dalton have confessed
that they took part in the brutal prize
fight in the basement of Fred Gatter's
shaving parlor last night.
Many prominent merchants, professional
men and not a few county officials and
others connected with the Sheriff's depart
ment are also in fear and trembling that
their names may be on the list now being
prepared by Chief of Police Hodgkins,
and for each of which a warrant will be
.sworn out for attending the fight.
The details of this brutal exhibition
were told exclusively in The Call this
morning. As soon as it was generally
known that such a violation of the law
ha.l taken place great indignation was ex
pressed, and as soon as the papers were
on tl<> streel officers were searching for
the principals and seconds. The first to
be arrested was Jtikey Baumgarten, the
winner of the fight. At the City Prison
he broke down entirely, shed tears copi
ously and told Captain Peterson a detailed
story "f the incident. Jakey wilingly ad
mitted that the prize light had been pre
pared by a number of sports on Broad
way, who had hung up the magnilicent
purse of $9 for the winner. He acknowl
edged that it was a contest for blood
and that they started it with the intention
of fighting to a mar. -- That Musa was not
NOT FIFTEEN, YET
A SLICK LITTLE THIEF
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, Aug. 4.
Josephine King, the clever little bunko
woman, who has carried out several petty
jobs around the bay during the past four
months, was arrested this morning. She
was sitting on a bench at Frnltvafe wait
ing fur an electric car when the officers
who were searching for her told her she
was wanted at the City Prison.
Josephine did not express any surprise
and admitted that some of the Jewelry
she was wearing was part of that stolen
from the house of Mrs. C. I* Frank. Al
though she had given Mrs. Frank the
name of Viola Clinton she did not hesi
tate to tell the police her true name and
admit that she had several others.
Though under sixteen years of age the
girl has had a lively experience. She has
frequently procured employment at
houses as a nurse girl and after remain- i
ing sufficiently long to become acquainted
with the locution of valuables she would
watch her opportunity. Bteal the jewelry'
and disappear. The last place at which
she carried out her scheme was Mrs.
Frank's on Webster street. She took from
there jewelry valued at $IT>O. and for sev
eral days baffled the detectives. She might
not have been discovered had not she
been keeping company with a young fel- j
low who was known to the police. A i
watch was set on him and this partly
led to the girl's arrest.
To Chief Hodgklns Josephine told her
story, which does not differ greatly from
the stories told by hundreds of other I
young girls who land in jail. Last
April she ran away from her home in
San Francisco and has been keeping com
pany with young men whose Influence
was not for the best. It is believed that j
one of these acquaintances induced her
to commit the robberies and was a sharer
in the proceeds.
The girl when arrested wore a dress
belonging to Mrs. Frank and at the City-
Prison she was permitted to change it and
the stolen garment was handed to its
owner. Josephine had just secured em
ployment near the Hermitage and her
employers were very much surprised to
| learn from the detectives this afternoon
that they had in' their house such a clever
little confidence operator. When Sergeant
Green arrested her she took him to the
house and showed him much stolen prop
erty, stating at the same time that the
rest of the plunder was at a house in
Alameda. ________________
STUFFERS' NAMES ARE OFF.
The Register Purged of Illegal Pri-
Mary Voters.
"Brick" Dolan, proprietor of the Crystal
House, at 673 Howard street, and his
seventeen lodgers who were suspected of
false registration, did not appear when
their names were called yesterday morn
ing at the meeting of the Board of Elec
tion Commissioners. The lodgers had been
cited to appear to prove their residence
in Dolan's district. On motion of Com
missioner Sheehan Registrar Steppacher I
was Instructed to strike their names from I
the register if they should not show up j
during the .day. None of them turned up.
Seven other names from a house at 107 ;
New Montgomery street were also or
dered stricken off. A resolution was I
adopted by the board granting permission
to Mr. Steppacher to hire all the deputies j
he might need on election day and during ;
the week following. He was also em
powered to examine all persons suspected
of fraudulent registration. The board ad
journed to meet again on Monday morn
ing at 10 o'clock.
In the Divorce Court.
Decrees of divorce on the ground of
desertion have been granted by Judge
Bahrs to Fritze Ellis from Hyman Ellis,
Frank M Affleck from Julia Affleck and
Joseph H. Hecht from Christina Hecht.
Suits for divorce on the ground of failure

For the Medal Fund.
Eight hundred dollars was subscribed
yesterday for the medal fund for the re
turning California Regiment by the cus
toms employes. More are to be heard
from and it is expected that $1500 In all
â¢will 6e obtained from this source-
killed when he fell heavily on the cement
basement lloor is regarded as somewhat
of a miracle, and his freedom from a se
vere accident is explained by himself in
the fact i hat his head is harder than the
usual heud.
A couple of hours later Musa was
brought in and also charged with a felony.
Then Archie Permien and Dalton, a col
ored man, were arrested for acting as
seconds, though Dalton denies that he of
ficiated in any such capacity.
The basement in wnien the fight war,
held was crowded with the men wno had
arranged the match and who had sub
scribed on an average 10 cents apiece to
.-â¢'. two youths batter each other. There
was no science in the combat and appa
rently no one to see that the ordinary
rules of fighting were enforced. No one
will admit being referee, and the report
that a prominent doctor acted in that
capacity was denied this afternoon by
the Chief of Police. The youths Hew at
each other for a couple of minuce.-, and
whether the blow that felled Mu.sa was
foul or not cannot be learned, fur no one
will admit being a witness to the bloody
affair. There was considerable talk th.it
Musa had been seriously injured, and he
did not revive until one of the bystanders
tbtew a bucket â <( tcewater over Mm.
Chief Hodgkins is compiling a list of all
the spectators and when he is satisfied
that he has it about complete he will have
warrants Issued for their arrest. Already
he has about twenty names, and it in
cludes a few officials who are supposed to
do all in their power to prevent such ex
hibitions as that of last night.
This afternoon Judge Smith fixed the
ball of the prisoners at $2, r Â»0 cash or $500
bonds. Thp spectators will be charged
with misdemeanor and $30 cash bail and
a fictitious name will save them from
undue publicity.
Some of Baumgarten's friends fur
nished a bond and he was released this
evening.
DUTRA MUST DEED
BACK ALL HIS PROPERTY
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Aug. 4.
Doeds to some property and the transfer
of a life Insurance policy are now pre
venting ttie reconciliation of Frank Dutra,
the wealthy farmer of Eden Township,
and his pretty young wife, Wha eloped a
few days ;:l.'o With a farmhand.
It has been reported that the Dutras
were reconciled, but such is not the case,
and the friends of Mrs. Dutra are wry
anxious to correct what they declare Ja a
false impression regarding her actions.
They deny forcibly that there was any
real elopement. Mrs. Dutra merely
walked away from her home and came to
Oakland with a gentleman friend, who,
they assert, returned to San Leandro
later the Fame evening.
Al Vargas has prepared a signed state
ment of this sensation that has shocked
the Portuguese colony in the township.
He says that Mrs. Dutra and young
ITorst did not elope. "The lady found Mr.
Forst in the San Leandro Creek, and they
sat down near the road and indulged in a
conversation. Here the husband found
them and then he went into town ml de
nounced them. The same evening Forst
ttvok the wife to Oakland and retuine.l to
San Leandro with her later, going tc the
home of her brother-in-law. The follow
ing day the husband went to his brother's
bouse asking him to put her out. Throe
days later Dutra repented and was very
anxious for a reconciliation, but in t!n>
interval her husband had transferred his
property and also his life insurance pol
icy to other parties. The young wife's
friends advised her not to consent to a
reconciliation until her husband put the
property and the policy of the U. P. E. C.
in their own names.
"Mrs. Dutra says she will return to him
when he has done this. He frequently
goes to see her, but refuses to o'come
reconciled to her except such reconcilia
tion be entirely without conditions."
This story differs materially from that
told by Mrs. Dutra's sister, who said a
few days ago that her sister had deliber
ately decided to leave her husband and
even took her personal effects with her.
In the meantime the whole Portuguese
colony is discussing the troubles cf the
Dutras, the farmer being a leader among
them. __________
Attacked by a Spaniard.
OAKLAND. Aug. 4.â Thomas Woods, a
colored man, was attacked at Melrose
early to-night by a Spaniard armed with
a knife and revolver, who swore that he
would kill him, Mrs. Woods or any con
stable threatening to interfere. Deputy
Sheriff Quinian arrested the desperado
before he had inflicted any serious injury
on Woods and booked him under the name
of John Doc at the County Jail for as
sault with a deadly weapon. The Spaniard
had been drinking and refused to divulge
his name.

INSANE SEAL
HUNTER PUZZLES
OAKLAND POLICE
William Little Is a Man
of Mystery.
Oakland office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Aug. 4.
William Little, aged 29 years and sup
posed to be a seal hunter lately from Vic
toria, B. C, is Oakland's latest mystery.
The police authorities and the Commis
sioners of Lunacy are considerably puz
zled over the stranger, and the belief
prevails among some that the young man
is wanted in British Columbia for some
crime which in his efforts to hide has un
hinged his mind.
Little's advent into this city became
known last night when he was found
prowling about the buildings in the rail
road yards at the foot of Peralta street.
He was apparently searching for some
thing with the aid of two lanterns he had
helped himself to. Night Watchman 1.
H. Brown, observing the stranger, ap
proached him and inquired what he was
after. Apparently taken by surprise. Lit
tle answered: "Don't you see them?
Don't you hear them groaning? 1 fixed
them plenty."
Brown immediately summoned the po
lice and had the trespasser taken to the
receiving hospital for insane. At the hos
pital the young man, after being informed
of his arrest and giving his name, age and
occupation, refused to divulge any other
facts that might lead to his identity or
antecedents, loafer he became violent
and made an attack on Steward Borchert.
who he said was a sea lion which must
be killed. It was necessary to strap him
down.
When eamined this afternoon by Drs.
W. F. B. Wakefleld and A. H. Pratt noth
ing in the way of information could be
drawn out of him except an intimation
that he has a brother in an asylum in
Utah. . ,
His pockets were searched, and in them
was found a bankbook showing a deposit
of $75 in the Victoria branch of the Bank
of British Columbia, also two baggage
checks stamped by the Pacific Coast
Steamship Company. In his purse he had
$fj 15, also some English coins and a bogus
dollar. He was fairly well dressed and
curried a Waltham gold watch with plain
chain.
On a slip of paper was found an ad
dress, "Third and Howard streets, S. F.
Detective Herbert with this clew hurried
to the metropolis and learned that Little
had been stopping a day or so at a hotel
at the address given.
Late this afternoon Little was taken be
fore Judge Hall and committed to the in
sane asylum at Stockton.
An effort will be made to secure Little a
trunk or baggage, and District Attorney
Allen will in a few days apply for letters
of guardianship on the estate.
ALMOST ENDED IN A
COLD-BLOODED MURDER
OAKLAND, Aug. 4.â A cold-blooded \
murder was narrowly averted at the cigar ;
store of Henry C. Poole, corner of Sev- J
enth and Pine streets, early this evening. !
As it is, S. J. Drew, a brakeman in the
employ of the Southern Pacific Com
pany, is lying at his home, RB3 Bay street, j
where a physician is treating him for nu- i
merous ugly wounds inflicted with a large j
pocket knife.
His assailant, Wm. Connelly, aged 20 j
years, is booked at the City Prison for j
an assault with a deadly weapon. Dennis
Connelly, a brother one year younger,
over whom the trouble arose, is also a
prisoner, charged with disturbing the j
peace. Bad blood has existed between j
the younger Connelly and Drew for some
time. When they met this evening in
.West Oakland the former addressed a vile ;
epithet to the hraKeman. The latter re- |
b< nt. il and a mix-up followed in which '
Connelly was felled to the ground. His j
friends picked him up and an hour later*
he and his brother hunted up Drew,
whom they found seated in front of j
Poole' s cigar store.
To avoid a renewal of hostilities Drew
stepped into the store, but William Con- â 
nolly followed him. and whipping out a !
large pocket knife declared he would "fix
him." at the same time calling him a vile
name and lunging his weapon at Drew's ;
face. The first blow cut a gash across j
Drew's nose, another inflicted a wound I
near the mouth, the third grazed the :
brakeman's chest, cutting through his
vest and the fourth gashed Drew's hand.
But for the timely interference of by
standers a murder seemed inevitable. Of
ilcer McKeegan was summoned and ar
rested the Connolly boys.
William Connolly was arrested about
three months ago in connection with the !
bras* robberies at the West Oakland rail
road yards. The charge was reduced to
petty larceny, and Police Judge Smith at
the time suspended sentence.
FOND HUSBAND HIT
HER WITH A SPADE
OAKLAND. Aug. 4.â Bloodshed marked
the latest chapter In the matrimonial
troubles of Mr. and Mrs. J. Hays at their
home on Second street to-day. Margaret
Hays who is a corpulent person of 62
years, presented herself at the Receiving
Hospital this afternoon to be treated for
an ugly though not serious incised wound
on the right side of her head. When
asked by Steward Borchert in what man
ner rhe'wound, from which blood flowed
copiously, had been inflicted the injured
wife replied: "I was hit with a spade by
my fond husband, who is a native of
Dunne Gall, near the County of Mayo,
Ireland; but he'll be sorry yet." The pa
tient vigorously objected to having the
wound stitched with the physician's
needle, which she termed a "bogie in
strument." The wound was therefore
given simply an antiseptic dressing,
tapped off with a coat of healing powder,
which gave It the appearance of high
priced strawberry shortcake, as the stew
ard facetiously put it. Mrs. Hays hus
band, it is understood, took offense at
the remark made by his wife that ' he
didn't come from her town."

THROUGH FRAUD
AND DECEIT SHE
LOST HER LOTS
Berkeley Woman Says
She Was Bunkoed.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway. Aug. 4.
If the charges of fraud and deception
alleged by Marie B. Samouillet in a rather
sensational complaint filed in the Superior
Court this afternoon are true, she has
been victimized out of her property in
Berkeley in a manner that has few equals.
The suit iB directed against Thomas F.
Gregory and Patrick J. Marron. though
the Pacific States Savings, Loan and
Building Company and several others ot
fictitious names are joined as defendants.
According to Mrs. Samouillet's com
plaint, prepared by Attorneys Whitwortlx
and Shurtleff of San Francisco, plaintiff
on July 11 last was the owner of three
valuable lots on Addison street, near
Milvia. Berkeley, together with the tene
ments and hereditaments thortuntu be-
longing.
'â¢On the said last namrf date." recites
the complaint, "the plaintiff was by the
above named defendants. Thomas F.
Gregory and Patrick .1. Marron. induced
to agree to Â«ell and convey the said prop
erty to them for the price of $3500 in
fnited State? sold coin, to be paid an>l
which they affreed to pay as follows, viz.:
$500 cash at the time of conveyance or
delivery r.f deed and the balance thereofâ
to wit, $::000â within â years thereafter,
to be evidenced and secured by promis
sory note secured by a first mortgage
upon the property."
Continuing, the complaint recites that
nn the same day plaintiff was induced by
defendants to sign, acknowledge and de
liver to them a deed to the property, with
the understanding that they would forth
with pay hpr $310 and deliver to her the
$3000 promissory note, together with a first
mortgage. After paying plaintiff but $400
defendants bad the deed recorded and
have since fraudulently and falsely rep
resented to the public, so says the com
plaint, and to persons to whom they have
tried to sell that they owned the three
lots. Plaintiff alleges further that the
Pacific States Savings and Loan Company;
now asserts some claim to thr> property.
Mrs. Samouillet asks that the court de
cree that the conveyance was obtained
by fraud and deceit and that ownership
be restored to her. or that defendants be
ordered to pay her the balance as origin
ally agreed upon.
THRASHED THE MAN WHO
HAD INSULTED HER
RUSSELL PARISER LEARNS A
LESSON ON GARBULITY.
I ALAMEDA, Aug. 4.â Russell Parlser. a
young- man employed by the Southern Pa-
I cific Company, was thrashed on Park
! street last night by Florence Smith, a
; girl well known about the city. Sergeant
I Kamp of the police force looked on while
I the beating was being administered but
made no effort to protect the youth who
had been made the object of Miss Smith's
| wrath.
Parlser, whose home Is on Central aye-
I nue, near Oak street, associates with a
â  crowd of youthful sports who congregate
i nightly in front of the cigar stores <n
; Park street and have made a practice of
applying insulting remarks to ladie3 or
young girls who happened to pass them.
Several evenings ago the Smith girl ac
costed Parlser and a companion with
i whom she happened to be acquainted. ...he
j said something to the companion that did
not suit Pariser's fancy, and he told the
girl to "shut up her mouth." She retorted
I by telling him that she would "smash hia
i face" as soon as the opportunity present-
I ed Itself. Pariser told her that Mrs. PreÂ»
--| cott, agent of the Society for the Suppr.es
sion of Vice, was looking for her. This
, riled the young woman, and she pro-
I ceeded to carry out her threat to smash
faces there and then, but Parlser made his
I escape. He kept off Park street after
' that experience until last night, when ho
again appeared at his usual haunts.
Miss Smith was on the lookout for him
She met Sergeant Kamp on the street and
I complained to him that Pariser had in
sulted her. Kamp stepped up to the young
man to caution him against such action
in the future under penalty of arrest.
While he was talking to him Miss Smith
walked up and, with the remark, "You
. dirty pup!" hit Pariser over the right eye
with her clinched fist. The blow was a
stinging one and dazed the young man
l Before he recovered from the shock he re
i ceived another whack on the side of his
i face. The second blow was evidently more
painful than the first, for Pariser' began
to cry. and begged the policeman to pro
tect him. The officer seemed to enjoy the
fun, and did not interfere, and Pariser fled
into a nearby cigar store to escape Mies
! Smith's wrath.
The young snorts who congregate on
' Park street at night have been a source of
| much annoyance, and Miss Smiths action
â  in taking the law into her own hands has
! been commended. The police are falling 1
: in for a deal of criticism in making no
attempt to reprimand the "statues."
Will Sell the Yacht Whirlwind.
OAKLAND. Aug. 4.â Superior Judge
Hall to-day issued an order authorizing 1
A. W. yon Schmidt, administrator of the
estate of the late E. A. yon Schmidt, to
sell the yacht "Whirlwind at public or pri
vate sale. The yacht is now lying in the
mud of the estuary, fast deteriorating

JUDGE CONLAN'S LOSS.
His Only Son Dies From Pneumonia
at Walnut Creek,
Ju<lgÂ« Conlan suffered an Irreparable
loss yesterday morning by the death of
his only son, Charles W. Conlan, a bright
boy 3 years and 8 months old. The boy
had been ailing for norae time and was
sent to friends at "Walnut Creek, where
he might find strength and health on
their ranch. He appeared to improve, but
a day or two ago he took a severe cold,
which developed into pneumonia. ThÂ«
Judge and his wife and Dr. Conlan were
summoned to Walnut Creek and were
with him when he passed away. The
Judge lost his mother last March and this
double bereavement will prove a sad blow
to him.

THE STOCK MARKET.
Securities continued quiet on the morning
session, and the only noteworthy change was
an advance in Giant Powder to $73 73.
Inthe afternoon Hawaiian Commercial de
clined to $96 62% and Giant fell back to $72 50.
Mining stocks were again strong, and moat
of them made a material advance. The tele
gram from the pump said: "At 6:30 thlsmorning
the water was down eighteen feet two inches
below the 19.10-foot level station, the -water
having risen and fallen during the past twen
ty-four hours, while the elevator waa working
continuously."
The Savage Mining Company has levied an
assessment of 19 cents per chare, delinquent
September 6.
The Union Consolidated Mining Company has
levied an assessment of 15 cents per share, de
linquent September 6. .
The Comstock mining companies are to pay
$v per horse power per month under the terms
of the contract with the Truckee River General
Electric Company for 5000 horse power. For
1500 horse power and below that the charge
will be $8 per horse power per month. There
will be a proportionate less charge for amounts
over 1500 horse power and up to 5000 horse
power.
The Standard Consolidated Mining Company
of Bodle has declared a dividend of 10 cents
per share. For the week ending July 29, very
little exploratory work was done in the mine.
Itals* 2, east vein, 150 level, showed six inches
of ore in the top, value not stated. Raise 4,
Security vein. 31S level, had pay ore in the top.
Raises 2 and 7. No. 10 vein, 318 level, had
respectively IS and 14 inches of fair ore in the
tops. There was no change in the other open
ings. The stopes in the Moyle, No. 10, Ma
guire, Fortuna and other ledges yielded a
small amount of fair to good ore. The stopes
were doing fairly well. Some very rich scale
was being taken from the footwall in No. 6
south stope In C vein on the 270 level. Opera
tions at the mine and mill were stopped six
days during the week, pending repair* on the
pipe line at Green Creek. The quantity of
ore crushed was, therefore, only fifty-six tons;
average assay vanner tailings $12 04; concen
trates produced half a ton, assay value not
given: amalgam produced 520% ounces, value,
per ounce, $3 49. Tailings plant No. 1 treated

SAN FRANCISCO AWAITS THE COMING
OF THE CALIFORNIA VOLUNTEERS
Checks Drop Unsolicited Into the
Fund for Reception.
The Citizens' Committee Considers Steps to Be
Taken to Secure Employment for
Returning Soldiers.
IF money talks, as they say it does, I
enough has been said already to
assure the success of San Francis
co's reception to the home-coming
California Volunteers. Fifty thou
sand dollars is the sum upon which
the Citizens' Committee has set its i
heart, and yesterday, without the j
least bit of " solicitation, more than j
$2000 went rolling into the treas
ury. Monday morning the business
and professional men of the city will j
start out each in the district mapped j
cut for him. Before nightfall it is j
expected the snowy fall of checks and !
the merry jingling of dropping dol
lars will remind one of a jolly sleigh
ing party on an Eastern winter day. 'â 
The manner in which well-known
citizens responded yesterday to the j
invitation of the finance committee j
shows that no one is daunted at the j
idea of raising the money necessary. j
No one asked the question "How will j
we get it?'' It was always, "When do j
we commence?" The answer came at
once in the shape of letters contain
ing checks for the following amounts:
San Francisco Brewers' Asso
ciation $1000 i
Stock and Bond Exchange .. . 250
London, Paris and American
Bank 250 j
Merchants' Exchange 100 j
Loyal Legion 50
Goldberg, Bowen & Co. ... 50
"With the balance left from the j
moneys collected for the reception i
heretofore held, amounting to ,
5347 76. this makes a starter of
52047 76. Not so bad.
In addition to this commencement,
the attention of the newly formed
citizens' finance committee has been
called to the necessity of steps to se
cure employment, either old or new,
for returning volunteers. The senti- |
ment seemed to be unanimous that j
there would be no difficulty on this
head.
The theatrical managers, who have
set themselves the task of raising
SSOOO of the necessary amount, are
hard at work and will leave no stone
unturned to make the benefit a
golden-lined, artistic success. The
managers, like the members of the j
citizens' executive and finance com- l
mittees. have received proffers of all
kinds of assistance free from various
sources.
The auction sale of boxes and
choice seats for the big benefit will be
held at the Orpheum next Thursday,
beginning at noon. Mayor Phelan i
will make a speech and Actresses
Edna Wallace Hopper, Miss Anglin,
Juliet Crosby, Alice Neilsen and num
erous beauteous others will smile on
prospective purchasers.
The executive committee meets
this morning at 11 o'clock at the
Chronicle building. The decoration
committee meets this afternoon at 3
o'clock at the Union Trust building.
CITIZENS WILL
SOLICIT FUNDS
Large Subscriptions Are Sent
in Without Ask
ing.
In response to invitation half a hundred
representative business and professional
men of the city met yesterday afternoon
in Superior Judge Carroll Cook's court
room at the City Hall to organize a citi
zens' finance committee to operate with
a like body, of which M. 11. de Young is
chairman, appointed by the executive re
ception committee.
M. H. de Young- called the meeting to
order and stated the purpose to be the or
ganization of a citizen body to collect sub
scriptions to a fund for the reception of,
lirst, the returning Californians, and then
of other volunteer soldiers from the Phil
ippines. He said that in addition to the
money the committoemen might subscribe
themselves their time was needed to so
licit. The city was so districted by the
executive committee, he continued, and
all the machinery' for collecting was In
such shape that it would not take more
than two or three mornings to clear, up
â¢. i >rk.
i irganization was perfected by the elec
tion of Colonel George H. Pippy as secre
tary, and the meeting proceeded to busi
ness, the following answering rollcall:
Mayor James D. Phelan, Charles L. Patton
William A. lieane, A. G. Booth. F. W. Dohr

Kahn. F. C. Masteller, Rudolph Herold, Chlff

and Major W. B. Hooper.
The edge of the sorrow of the meet-
Ing at the reading of letters from various
gentlemen r> Â«r<tting their inability to be
present was taken off by the Indosure
of checks for the cause. C. Altschul,
manager of the London, I'aris and Amer
ican Bank, inclosed a check for $250 as
the contribution of that institution;
Henry Schwartz, secretary of the San
Francisco Stock and Bond Exchange',
Biade apology for his absence with a
check for a similar amount as the sub
on ''1" the Exchange; Hermann Ep
pinger, president of the Merchants' Ex
change, Inclosed a check for $100; Hugo
D. Kelt's absence was atoned for by a
letter Inclosing Goldberg, Bowen & Co.'s
check for $60. Ben Cohen, hatter, at 330
Kearny street, offered to the committee
as his contribution 50 per cent of the
Bales of his store on Monday, August 7.
He asked that the committee send a
cashier to look after the sales, he hav
ing inclosed a check for So to pay such
cashier's salary. Roche & Hoeber's let
ter informed the committee that the
printing establishment of Francis, Val
entine & Co., of which they are proprie
tor.-, would do all poster work and print
ing required free of charge.
The applause that greeted these checks
and offers had hardly died down before
It broke out afresh and louder at the
announcement of the chair that C. B.
Stone, on behalf of the San Francisco
Brewers' Association, had left with the
committee a check for $1000. E. A.
Denicke reported that the Ix>yal Legion
had voted $50 to the reception committee.
With regard to the matter of collect
ing funds for the reception. Congressman
Kahn, who was secretary of the finance
committee of Midwinter Fair, said that
the plan inaugurated at that time of
cutting up the city into 6mall collection
districts would suit admirably the pres
â¢nl purpise. With the assurance from
the chnir that such was the Intention
he offered the following resolution: J
That the chairman appoint nine members of
this body to be known as the flnam-e commit
tee's executive council. The chairman and
secretary shall also be members of this com
mittee. That the powers and duties of this
council shall be to make assignments for the
different collection districts and to fill vacan
cies where members fail to do their duty. That
all members of the committee shall report to
the executive council. The council will see that
a thorough canvass is made for funds, and
further they shall meet daily at an hour to be
fixed : y themselves at the headquarters of the
finance committee.
"Is it understood," asked Mr. Sonntag,
"that the citizens of San Francisco are
getting up this reception, or is it a State
affair? It seems to me that a great many
of the soldiers that weni to Manila are
residents of other sections of the State.
"Every man in the First Regiment,' re
plied Henry T. Scott, "belongs to this
*" Chairman de Young said that it was not
the Intention to â¢ scpend all of the money
on the reception to the California boys,
but to use som< part of it for the recep
tion of other returning recruits.
"The committee," continued Mr. de
Young, "invited a number of Oakland
men to the meeting to-day, but not one
of them has responded."
The resolution offered by Congressman
Kahn was carried and the chair named
the committee as follows: Julius Kahn,
C. B. Stone, Charles L. Patton, Grove P.
Ayers, A. J. Raisch, Paris Kilburn, Henry
Sonntag A. H. Vail and John P. Jackson.
The chair announced that since the
appointment of the committee subscrip
tions had been received and disburse
ments made for the ption to the Ore
gon volunteers. He called for the partial
report of Treasurer Dohrmann, as fol
lows:

Chairman de Young announced that the
committee was in receipt of a letter upon
which he thought some action should be
taken in the meeting. It referred to the
reinstatement in their old places of em
ployment of the returning volunteers. He
said there ought to be an organization of
citizens to procure employment for the
returned volunteers who are not able to
get their former places. The letter was
read as follows:
SAX FRANCISCO, Auk. 4..1599.
M. H. de Youngâ My Dear Sir: 1 am in re
ceipt of your letter of even date Inviting me
to be present at the council chambers of the.
Board of Supervisors in the City Hall at 3
o'clock this day to consider <iuestions relative
to the reception of our California boys and
other soldiers returning from the Philippines, i
I would say in reply that 1 have no doubt as
to the character of the reception that our boys
will get when they reach h..me; that will be
all right. My anxiety about the boys com
mences at the date of their discharge.
I think one of the most useful committees
that could be appointed would be one whose
duties would be to ascertain by whom each
of these boys was employed before going
away, and, if possible, to get a pledge that
every one should have his old place open to him
when he returns. Four splendid young fellows
left our house to go to the war; one died at
Manila. The others can all have their old
places immediately after they return. In doing
this none of our present employes will be dis
charged.
If a similar promise could be obtained from
other employers whose boys left to go to the
war I am sure that more permanent good
would come from such pledges than any other
work that can or will be done by the com
mittee having these matters in charge. If we
did our whole duty now, not only to prepare
a hearty and royal welcome when thÂ«>sp boys
arrive, but to secure them steady, honest em
ployment after they return. San Francisco ne< d
never have a soldier on the street, late from
the Philippines, who, by nrglect, has been
driven to be a tramp or a bum.
We have also one representative in Colonel
Summers' regiment, now at the Presidio, and
have written our Portland manager to reinstate
him as soon as the Oregonlans reach home.
Yours very truly, A. H. VAIL.
"The executive committee, in its head
quarters tent." said Mayor Phelan, "has
fitted up a place for a secretary and for a
great register upon which may be in
scribed the names of the boys returning,
and I think the committee could make
efforts to secure employment for any that
are unable to do so.
"Right here," he continued. "I would
like to correct the impression that we are
providing only for the reception of the
First California, We are endeavoring to
provide for all who showed a disposition
to and did enlist. The Native Sons' Com
mittee has found at least 9000 men who
enlisted in California, A large number of
these, through no fault of their own, were
compelled to remain at home. I think
we should take care of them as the Native
Sons have. It will interest the State in
our work. When there is a reunion, as
there undoubtedly will be, all Californians
who enlisted will come here and be re
ceived as soldiers."
"I do not think," said Henry T.
Scott, "there will be any trouble
about the California boys getting back
their old places. So far as the Union Iron
Works is concerned they will. They had
that promise before they left, and 1 think
other employers in the city feel the same
way. I will say, too, for the Union Iron
Works that after our own volunteers are
back at work, if there are any good me
chanics among the other volunteers look
ing for work, we'll give them jobs."
Fire Commissioner Bohen said the men
who enlisted from the Fire Department
would get back their places. Captain Nel
son added that if there was a scarcity of
Jobs in the city for returning volunteers
there was plenty of opportunity in the
lumber woods of Humboldt County, to
which he would be glad to give them
transportation.
The meetirtg then adjourned, with the
understanding that the executive council
was to meet this morning at 11 o'clock at
the Chronicle building.

PROVIDING FOR
THE VOLUNTEERS
A Suggestion for Use of Part
of the Reception
Moneys.
The following communication Is in Hne
with the sentiments expressed yesterday
in the letter of A. H. Vail of Sanborn,
CAUGHT WITH COUNTERFEIT
COIN IN THEIR POSSESSION
AGENT CRONIN of the United States Secret Service Division made a
clever capture yesterday afternoon of a man and a woman who are
suspected of having been engaged in the manufacture of counterfeit
dollars, halves and dimes for a long time past. The man and a male
confederate had Just passed a counterfeit dollar on a saloon-keeper at the
corner of I/arkin and McAllister streets. The confederate escaped, but Karl
Kristensen and Mrs. Mary Terry, alias Mrs. Kristensen, alias Nellie Brown,
were arrested in the vicinity.
Kristensen and the woman occupied a suite of three rooms at 511 cMdy
street, and had been living together since last April. The pair were taken to
the City Prison and searched. All that was found was a dollar and two dimes,
all counterfeit. Secret Service Agents Hazen and Crontn then searched the
rooms of the prisoners and foun-1 a complete outfit of molds, together with a
quantity of tin and lead, out of v)nch the counterfeit money had been made.
They also found a quantity of half-finished coins.
The woman came from Lansing. Mich., about two years ago. She gave the
name of Nellie Brown to the detectives, but they ascertained her real name
and her past history, which is ?ald to be far from savory.
Kristensen said that he kept a restaurant at the Manchester House on
Sixth street five or six years ago and that he returned from the Klondike
about six months ago. He admitted having coined the money, but said
that he had no intention of passing the pieces. He had read about. the cap
ture of some counterfeiters in San l^uis Obispo County and he wondered how
bogus money was made, and simply for pastime he made some plaster molds
and a few pieces out of tin and lead. He carried three of the dollar pieces
around with him in his pockets because he did not like to have any one ttlink
that he was "broke." His friend, whjse name he refused to divulge, had
asked htm. for one of the dollars, and he had given it to him upon his prom
ise not to attempt to passs It.
The secret service men had boen watching Kristensen for some time. Com
plaints had been made that counterfeit coins had been passed upon pool
sellers and others at the racetrack, and Kristensen was found to be a fre
quent attendant at the races. This fact, reinforced by the information
gained afterward that Kristensen had no visible means of support, led to a
watch being placed upon him and the woman.
Vail & Co. to the citizens' finance com
mittee. It goes a little further, however,
planning, in addition to the employment
of the returning volunteers, some mone
tary provision for those unable to get
their former positions. The letter reads:
SAN FRANCISCO, Aug. 3, 1899.
To the Kditor of The Callâ Dear Sir: I have
pbserved with pleasure the. grand preparations
for the reception of our boys of the First Cali
fornia Kegimeiy: on their return home. It
BhOWS not only patriotism, but an affection
â which again verifies the old adage that "blood |
is thicker than water." ..-.;"
I hope to live to be one of those who join
in . the ovation, for I had a boy with Dewey
who served on the Baltimore during the bat- |
tle of Manila Bay, and he is yet in the service. (
Therefore, I trust you will indulge me in the ;
expression of an idea which I deem of some
importance. It is this: When our boys of
the First left here they wore taken from every
walk of lifeâ lawyers, doctors, mechanics, ar- j
tisans, clerks and laborers. Many were taken
from the â  customs, postal, railway mail and
other services of Uncle Ham of a more peace- j
ful character. They were promised that, if
they brought back their flag with honor and ,
glory thej v would be reinstated; at least such !
of them as survived, of course.
Will those promises be kept? I am not a
pessimist, but there is a trite old saying to
this effert: '.'The white man is mighty un- I
sartin and niggers will run away."
In view of this fact, would it not be well to j
place some of the money now being raised as
a reserve fund for the purpose of relieving
those who may not get back their jobs so as â¢
to enable them to live respectably until they ,
obtain employment? Would this not be better
than to serve the "fatted calf" all at once and
heave them to an aftermath of hunger and
dependence which will more than probably
occur In many Instances? J
Hoping this will meet with your approval, I ;
remain your obedient servant,
JAMES W. COL.L.INB.
54 Sixth street.
RELATIVES PREPARE
TO GREET THE BOYS
Big Banquet Already Assured
of Success.
The Parents' and Relatives' Association
of the First California Volunteers held
j an enthusiastic meetng last nght at Ar- j
mory Hall and made further arrange
ments for the banquet which they intend !
j giving their brave boys at the ferry build- I
ing on the morning of their arrival. C.
A Moores occupied the chair. He report
! Ed that the sums turned in by the ladies
! for the banquet amounted to $775 75. On
j motion of T. A. Farless it was decided
to set aside enough money to entertain I
on their arrival here those boys who were
unfortunate enough to be left behind.
The following additions were made to
the executive committee: Mrs. Lieuten
; ant Jordan. Company E: Mrs. Captain j
McCreagh, Company D; Mrs. J. P. Gray. |
Battery A.<'alifornia Heavy Artillery : and
Mrs. Joyner. Battery D, California Heavy j
; Artillery. The executive committee will >
I meet this afternoon at the armory at 3]
o'clock.
Chairman Moores announced that the j
committee having in charge the purchase
of badges had ordered two thousand,
: which will be sold to the relatives of the
boys for '< cents apiece. The subject of |
the distribution of badges developed quite i
a spirited discussion. Many members as- :
Berted that the ferry building was not ,
large erough to hold the crowd. It was
suggested that only one member of every i
family attend while the boys are being !
banqueted. Badges can be had by the ;
relatives by applying to the committee
representatives of each company. Mr. >
Farless. summed up the situation in a I
very few words, and judging from the ap- i
plause his remarks received the rest of
the relatives present concurred in his sen
timents on the matter.
"I have a boy down there." said Mr.
Farless, "and 1 intend to get a badge
I simply as a souvenir and let his mother
go down to the ferry building and see
him first."
A special finance committee was ap
pointed consisting of T. A. Farless and
J. P. Young. Another name will be
added to the committee to-day.
Mrs. Russell Basset t, chairman of the
di eoiation committee, reported that the
committee had secured a banner five
yards long on which was Inscribed "Wel
come to Our Heroes." The cloth was do
nated by \V. G. Sterret and the lettering
w.is done gratis by Swan. Mrs. Bassett
also stated that the committee has se
cured flags from the Emporium, Will &
Finck, Albert Son and the California Fire
works Company.
The secretary was instructed to for
ward a vote of thanks to the Harbor
Commissioners and the Letter Carriers'
Hand, who have kindly volunteered to
furnish music with fifty pieces gratis.
Harry I. Fischer, secretary of the
Native Sons' committee-, was present and
made brief remarks concerning general
matters pertaining to the reception. The
association will meet again next Friday
night.

Red Men and Chosen Friends
The proposition for the Improved Order
of Red Men to take part in the Native
Sons' and Daughters' parade was dis
cussed in the Great Council yesterday and
it was the unanimous sense of the repre
sentatives that the order should welcome

be done a dispensation permitting the
tribes to parade was adopted.
Golden Gate Council of the Order of
Chosen Friends took the initiative last
night by appointing a committee of three
to request a like committee from each
of the other local councils to meet with
it next Friday to determine what shall
be done toward, the reception.
High Chief Ranger Boehm has called
a meeting of representatives of the
Ancient Order of Foresters for next Tues
day night to arrange fur the parade. It
is expected that this organization will
turn out more than a thousand members.

William Holmesinthe
Hospital.
WOUNDED IN THE ABDOMEN
ARRANGEMENTS FOR FUNERAL
OF COLONEL HAWKINS.
Chaplain Hunter of the Tenth
Pennsylvania Regiment Will
Accompany the Body
East.
William Holmes of Company F of the
casual detachment at the Presidio was
stabbed with a bayonet by J. Farrei. a
sentry on duty at the recruit camp.
Thursday night. Holmes is now in the
general hospital at the Presidio. The sur
geons will not say how serious the wound
is, but its location, in the abdomen, makes
it a dangerous one.
The sentry who did the stabbing is con
fined in the stockade at the recruit camp.
The officer of the day at that place
who is responsible for all prisoners did
not know the man had been arrested; he
did not know the name of the sentry, nor
did he know the name of the man wound
ed: and as to the assault he knew only
that such a thing he had heard had hap
pened. It had not been reported to the
adjutant of the casual detachment. Cap
tain Hardin, for be said he knew nothing
about the matter at all. He did not know
where it had happened nor did he know
who could tell anything about it. The
only thing certain about the whole case
is that the wounded man is at the gen
eral hospital and he may die.
Holmes says the whole thing was an ac
cident. He ia a cook, and with another
COOk lip was going down toward the com
pany kitchens when he was halted by a
sentry. He says he told the sentry he was
a cook and thought it would be all right,
but the sentry still refused to let him
pass. Then, be says, he tried to pass any
way and the sentry thrust his bayonet
at him and it entered his abdomen just
under the stomach.
The other side of the story is that the
two cooks were going down toward the
kitchens when thi> sentry stopped 'them.
They insisted on passing and he arrested
them. They were, released soon after and
then went down to the sentry's beat,
w ere they lay for him .to thrash him.
He saw tnem as they jumped at him and
thrust his rifle at them, wounding
Hollies.
Fra ik Drivall, Company F. First Col
orado Volunteers: Chris Raus, Company
H. First Wyoming Volunteers, and Wil

down Market street to the ferry, the pa
rade starting at 4 o'clock from the temple.

good seats and plenty to drink and smoke.
Waiters took their orders at every inter
mission, and in every way they were
made to feel as if they were at home.
There was a good deal of enthusiasm of
the martial kind and the various military
favorites were cheered. The Orpheum
and San Francisco came in for their share
of applause, but as usual Otis' name met
only derision.
