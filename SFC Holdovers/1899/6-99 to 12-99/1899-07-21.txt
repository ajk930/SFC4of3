POWERFUL INFLUENCES

His Behalf.
NEW" YORK. July 20.â A World special'
from Washing-ton says : A secret of great
mystery, involving: the Carter case and
the de=ire of the President to shield the
guilty parties, is directly traceable to the
folio wing interests: The New* York Cen
tra! Railroad, the Pennsylvania Railroad,
Senator T. C. Piatt of New York. Senator
Chaur.cey M. Depew*. Senator "A*. J. Sewa'l
of Nev.- Jersey, former Senator James
f rr.ith of New Jersey. R. F. Westcott. the
millionaire expressman of New" York;
John F. Gayr.cr. tormer treasurer of the
New York State Democratic Committee,
nnd E. D. Greene, a wealthy contractor
of New York.
Not less than twenty of the most prom
ir.cr.t Democratic and Republican Sen
ators and Representatives are directly in
terested in preventing an exposure of the
methods pursued by Captain Carter in his
misappropriation of more than $1,000,000 of
Government funds.
It i* to prevent the civil trial of these
conspirators that such powerful- influence
has been brought to hear to postpone ac
tion. Alsrer's dismissal was a heavy blow
to '"arter.

WELLINGTON HOTEL,
WASHINGTON, July 20.-â
"New York is entitled to recog-
nition. The War Department, by
reason of the many legal ques
tions which will come up in con
nection with our new dependen
cies, should have at its head one
of the best available lawyers in
the country."
President McKinley has made this
statement so many times of late that
it has come tc being accepted in all
quarters here as definitely settled that
a lawyer, rather than a soldier, is to be
placed at the head of the War De- .
partment. Of the available New York
lawyers, the President has spoken of
Elihu Root to several friends to-day in
a manner which indicates that he is be
ins more strongly considered in con
nection with the War Department port
folio at the present time than any other
man. At the same time, the President
has declared that he has not fully
mad*- up his mind and thai he will not
do so for several days. He has assumed
a listening attitude. He wants to hear
what the country has to say about
various men who ay be suggested as
available timber, and to consult with
| the arty leaders before reaching a de
cision.
It was reported here to-day that
Governor Roosevelt nd Senator Piatt
have indicated General F. V. Greene
of New Fork as* their soldier candidate,
and Mr. Root as .their, first choic**
among New York lawyers. Since the
President has declared that the matter
is still open, there is an earnest wish
among many public men here that he
will finally recognize the necessity of
having a man of quick and vigorous
action at the head of the War Depart- j
ment, and will meet the country's de- !
mand for the appointment cf Governor
Roosevelt. They fear, however, that
he is so wedded to the idea of having
a lawyer instead of a soldier as his
War Secretary that it will be impos
sible to change his opinion upon this
point.
In further explanation of his desire i
to have a trained lawyer, Mr. McKinley !
stated to-day that the War Depart- I
ment would for the next- two or three!
years be the most important legal |
branch of the Government. Questions i
of policy in regard to the new civil
governments for the colonies will have
to be considered and plans outlined for 1
Congressional legislation. There are
also many important legal questions in
connection with river and harbor im
provements which always require the
attention of a good legal mind.
As to the conduct of the war.
the President feels that he already
has that ' subject well in hand.
The new provisional army Is rapidly
organizing. and the plan of campaign
for the- fall is pretty well defined. With
the assistance of Adjutant General
Corbin and General Miles, who is to
be the new factor ln the future mili
tary work of the War Department,
now that the disturbing element has
been removed, the President feels that
he, as commander in chief of the army,
will be able to carry the Philippine
war to a successful conclusion, leaving
the new Secretary of "War free for the
administrative and legal work of the
Department.
Secretary Alger will probably leave
Washington early next week, severing
his official connection with the War
Department on Monday, when he ex
pects to turn over his office to Assist
ant Secretary Meiklejohn, who will
reach here on Saturday, and act as
Secretary of War until a permanent
secretary assumes the office. Secre
tary Alger will spend the remaining
days of his service in closing up a
number of matter with which he is es
pecially familiar, including some knot
ty bridge and engineering projects. He
maintained silence' to-day respecting
his resignation and the causes which
led to its tender, and it is understood
that if he takes the public at all into
his confidence, ' it will not be until he
is entirely out of office.

NEW YORK STRIKERS
BATTLE WITH POLICE
Men Attempt to Wreck a Car
on Eighth Avenue, but
Are Prevented,
Officials of the Companies in Brooklyn and
Manhattan Claim to Have Control
of the Situation.
NEW YORK, July 20. -A marvel- 1
ous change has come over the
strike aspect from one end of j
Second avenue to the other. j
There was promise too. by Gen- j
eral Master Workman Parsons of a
complete tie-up of the trolley lines in j
Manhattan, with its consequent in
spiring effect upon the Brooklyn strik- J
ers. A general tie-up has not come by I
any means in New York. There was j
little or no rioting on Second avenue
to-day or to-night. The cars on that j
line ran throughout the day almost as j
they had run previous to the strike.
The Eighth avenue, which the strike
officials last night promised would be j
dead to-day, was moving right on time j
with only a hitch now and then, far j
up in Harlem, where a few roughs had
a clear field to run.
There is no strike on the Madison
avenue line, a scheduled meeting of the
car men of that line have fizzled out
to-night. Practically no trolley line in
New York City is affected save the
Second avenue.
A crowd of striking motormen of the
Eighth avenue line late this afternoon
attempted to wreck a car at One Hun
dred and Thirtieth street and Eighth
avenue, after driving the motorrnan
from the "platform. An Immense crowd
gathered and a bicycle policeman went
to the rescue. Other policemen arriv
ed about the same time. They broke
through the crowd and attacked the
strikers, arresting several of them. A
great crowd followed, jeering and
threatening the policemen, but were
driven off by the policemen who came
to the assistance of the roundsman and

abled car was nushed along to the
car barns and laid up for repairs.
The cars on the Eighth-avenue line
moved along with perfect regularity
after dark to-night.
In Brooklyn the Rapid Transit Com
pany put on several hundred new men
or have them ready, for duty, and in a
general way the cars on the affected
lines in that borough ran on good time
with what seemed to be a fair increase
in passenger traffic.
The strike, according to a statement
made by President Rossiter, has so far
cost the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Com
pany $55,000, or an average of $11,000 a
day, since it was started last Sunday
morning. About 90 per cent of the cars
ran regularly to-day on the main lines
and a little over 55 per cent on the
Nassau system. The De Kalb avenue
cars as well as the "L" roads are
carrying the greater part of the traffic
between Brooklyn and Manhattan.
A few cars were run under very slow
headway on. Many avenue, but they
were taken off at night. Cars were not
run on the Ocean avenue, Hicks street
and Graham avenue lines, And until
matters are settled cars will not be
run at night on the Fifth and Seventh
avenue, Flatbush and Green Point
lines although several cars were run
ning to-day under slow headway.
About 500 men have been taken on by
the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company.
They came from Chicago, Philadelphia
and Boston. â¢ About 800 more men are
required for the full complement of
cars, the company requiring, when run
ing full strength, 1597 cars and 3194

RIOTOUS STRIKERS HOLD
STREETS OF CLEVELAND
CLEVELAND, July 20. â Several
small riots occurred to-day. A crowd
of 300 attacked a car in South Brook
lyn, where the track had been ob
structed. The conductor with a re
volver held the mob at bay while the
motorrnan removed the obstruction,
and the car proceeded. Another car
was stoned at the same place later.
Another mob attacked a car near the
Petrie-street bridge. The windows were
smashed, but nobody was hurt.
About 9 o'clock -night a dynamite
cartridge was exploded under the
wheels of a Euclid-avenue car at Erie
and Prospect streets. The wheels of
the car were destroyed by the explo
sion, and one woman, a passen
ger, fainted, but nobody was in
jured. There was no crowd in the vi
cinity, nor was anybody seen to place
the cartridge. Earlier in the evening
a mob attacked a crosstown car on
Wilson avenue near the corner of Lex
ington avenue. Stones were thrown,
and the non-union conductor and mo
torman fired several shots at the crowd
irom their revolvers. It is stated that
_l -nan was shot through the wrist,
but the police deny this.
About the same time all the avail
able police on duty in the downtown
districts were called to the Humboldt
street -viaduct, on the Broadway line.
where a riot was in progress. A crowd
of 1000 men and boys were engaged in
piling obstructions on the track 3.
Ropes were -thrown over the trolley
wires in the attempt to pull them
down. Only one policeman was on duty
at the viaduct. He was stoned and
driven from the scene, and a girl was
hit with a stone and seriously hurt.
Three patrol wagon loads of police re
sponded to the call, and the mob was
dispersed. It is feared that more dam
age will be done before morning. The
company is getting new men daily. Be
tween fifty and seventy-five men ar
rived from Chicago and St. Louis.
These men are boarded at the barns.

FALLON". SANTA CRUZ, July C".
Mayor Phelan arrived in Santa Cruz
at 6:05 this evening, and as the train
pulled into the station he was greeted by
the entire regiment with upraised swords.
As he stepped down from the platform
Colonel Sullivan grasped him heartily by
the and and escorted him to his car
riage, which stood in the line Just behind
the colors.
On his entrance to the mess tent at
the dinner hour, the Mayor was greeted
with loud cheers by both officers and pri
vates, In answer to the tumultuous cries
for a speech, he mounted a bench and
made a few appropriate remarks, con
cluding with an invitation to the cadets
to be his guests at his country home to
morrow.
At the dinner table the boys accepted
the "Mayor as one of their own number,
and hardly had the first course been
served when the somewhat impertinent
query. "How do you like the stew,
Jimmy?" came in a noisy chorus from
one end of the table, while whatever re
ply, his Honor might have made was
drowned in a tumult of boyish laughter.
This informal reception startled him for
a moment, but he fell into the spirit of
the occasion, and his genial smile told
that whatever his opinion of camp Stew
might- be, he was in hearty accord with
the temperament of his hosts.
This evening the regiment lined up for
dress parade in front of the St. George
Hotel. .The street was crowded with spec
tators and every vantage point about the
hotel from the veranda to the roof was
taken. As the boys countermarched In
front of the reviewing stand a burst of
applause from the hundreds of onlookers
almost drowned the noise, clatter of
drums and the blare of the bugles. After
the parade had been dismissed, the band

CRATER IN ACTIVE
OPERATION

molten lava were Issuing from the
sides of the crater, one of which is
down the Kau siCe and another toward
Hilo over the old flow of 1881 which
reached Waiakea, and which the legend
states was stopped by Princess Ruth
and her Bible. This, however, is mere
conjecture, for up to the present writ
ing no news from the crater itself has
reached Hilo. Still from Hilo a lava
flow is plainly visible, but which direc
tion it will take when it reaches the
tableland between the two mountains
remains to be seen. Early on Wednes
day morning many of the Hilo leisure
class left for the Volcano House, and
expeditions to the crater are being
formed in Hilo."
Another account is taken from the
Hllo Tribune, which says: "The erup
tion was first noticed at the Volcano
House, when early on the morning of
July 4 Mr. Waldron and the guests of
the hotel were wakened by an explosion
and on making their way to the ver
anda witnessed one of the grandest and
most elaborate displays of Pele's dis
pleasure ever yet seen. The outbreak
occurred on the side of Mauna Loa at
an elevation of about 10,000 feet and in
about the same place as where issued
the flow of 1880-81. Two immense
fountains of lava were forced in the air
to an elevation of many hundred feet,
and from these and the constant over
flow from the mountain were rapidly
formed the three lava flows which are
now steadily,, making their way down
the mountain side and toward the sea.
"These streams of lava- have each
taken different directions, and the
rapidity of their movements is de
pendent on the obstructions and de
pressions of the country through which
they pass. The smaller -flow is in the
direction of Kllauea, and is about
twenty miles distant from the hotel
(Volcano House.) What is apparently
the second flow ln size on the Hllo
side, as nearly â¢as can be estimated,
will take about the same course as the
Wailuku River. The third flow, which
has taken its way toward the Kau side
is, to all appearances, the largest lava
flow yet witnessed on the Island, and
seems to be making rapid progress in
its path of destruction. As yet sufficient
time has not elapsed to obtain correct
measurements and speed of these dif
ferent flows, but men have been sent to
the scene of activity by Julian Mont
sarrat and W. H. Shipman, and will
probably be returning within the next
two or three days. The erruption
shows no signs Of abatement and the

Santa Cruz society and the elite from
surrounding towns was well represented
at the grand ball and reception tendered
the League of the Cross Cadets by the
Young Ladies' Institute of this city last
evening, In the language of an old resi
dent. It was the "swellest" function given
in the city by the sea In years. From 9
o'clock, when the grand march was in
augurated, until midnight the hall was a

good floor made dancing a pleasure, and
judging by the happy -Repressions on the
faces of those present everybody had a
delightful time.
Captain P. L. Bannon was officer of the
day: Lieutenant L. A. McCrystle, officer
of the guard, and Lieutenant T. Branson,
supernumerary officer.
Supervisor Deasy and ex-State Senator
J. C. Gorman were spectators at the
skirmish drill this morning. The charge
proved a little too realistic as two mem
bers of the first and second battalions

one of Its men being the first to make an
imprint on the fence with a sword. The
rlvalrv between the companies to reach
the fence first was extremely keen and
the victory of Captain Hopper's company
was only won by a narrow margin.
Captain Hopper, Lieutenant Steele and
Father Dempsey drove to Capitola yester
day. They were accompanied by the band
and on the arrival of the party the mu
sicians entertained the guests at the hotel
with music. Through the courtesy of
Manager Smith the musicians and visitors
went In swimming and later were the
guests of the hotel at luncheon. After
eating music was resumed in the dance
hall and the summer boarders tripped the
light fantastic. -
After "the reception tendered by the !
1 sight by night and the early morning
hours is one of unusual grandeur and
brilliancy. At the Volcano House,
which is probably some twenty-five
! miles from the outbreak, lights are not
j required throughout the night, and the
I country for many miles around the
, mountain is brilliantly illuminated."
The steamer Upolu arrived from Ha
waii yesterday and brought a letter
! from Sheriff Andrews of Hilo to At
' torney General Cooper, dated July 10,
j from which the following extracts are
taken:
"The lava from the. eruption near the
summit of Mauna Loa continues to flow
with apparently undiminished force.
As far as we can" learn, and we are
taking particular pains to inform our
selves of everything in connection with
the flow, It is still uncertain what
I course the flow will take. It may go
1 to Kau, Olaa, Hilo, by way of the 1881
flow, or Kiholo, by way of the 1859 flow.
i If it takes the first or last of these
courses, it will of course mean little or
no damage to Hilo. Past history shows
: that flows from near the summit are
both large and long; for instance, the
; flow of 1881. tftftf
"Laterâ l have just learned by tele
! phone from a police officer at Waimea
S that the flow has reached a point near
; or below Kalaeeha hills, the main sta-
I tion of the Humuula sheep station.
1 This information was gleaned by the
| police officer from a native who had
I just come down from the. place, and is
no doubt authentic. If this is the case,
the course must be direct to Hllo, and
not Kiholo. The easiest route to the
scene of action is by way of Waimea,
taking from there the wagon road to
Kalaeeha." *. â¢
Circuit Judge Gardner K. Wilder of
Hllo indorses the letter.
The Upolu also brought the news that
there had been another outbreak on
! the Kona side of Mauna Loa at about
i the same altitude as the ones on the
Hilo side.
It may here be said for the informa
tion of those not familiar with Hawai
ian topography that Mokuaweoweo is
the summit crater of Mauna Loa, on
the island of Hawaii. Its technical di
mensions are: Area, 3.70 square miles,
or 2370 acres; its circumference. 50.000
feet, or 9.47 miles; its length. 19.500 feet,
or 3.7 miles; its width, 9200 feet, or 1.74
miles, and its elevation, 13,675 feet
above sea level.
Kilauea, the largest active volcano in
the world, is also on the same island
of Hawaii. Its dimensions are: Area,
4.14 square miles; circumference, 7.85
miles; extreme width. 10,300 feet; ex
treme length, 15.500 feet, and elevation
at the Volcano House, 4040 feet.
It may be interesting to those cu
rious in the legendary lore of a people
to know that Hawaii is rich in tradi
tions in regard to Pele and her sisters.
I will give one which depicts her dou
ble character. In the ancient days, be
fore the arrival of the good mission
aries, whenever Pele desired to give
preliminary notice of a display of fire
works at either of her three homesteads
of Mokuaweoweo, Haleakala or Kl
lauea, she invariably presented herself
upon this earthly paradise as a female
of most fascinating beauty. Having
captured her adoring swain, she led
him in wreaths of spiral clouds to the
crater's mouth. He vanished there and
she, transformed into an indescribably
hideous hag. disrobed in the. first pillar
of fire that rushed to the heavens with
a noise as discordant as a broadside
from the Olympla' guns.

Special Correspondence of The Call.
HONOLULU, July 13.â 0n the morning
of July 7 news was received of the death
by poison of a comparative stranger, who
had attracted considerable passing atten
tion by her great beauty and the fact that
her "husband," one of the "late arrivals,"
had earned a popular reputation as a
good business man and good fellOw among
a certain class. "- 1 -
H. N. Almy, manager of the Washington
Light Company of this city, states that
I the deceased, Edith "Almy" (whose real
| name was not disclosed, but who is said
j to be a niece of John Baird, a well-known
jeweler of. San Francisco) lived with him
! here as his wife. He had known her in
i San Francisco and furnished her with
money. She. came here on the 11th of
! JUne and rejoined him.
Almy's story, as told to the deputy mar-
I shal, is that he and the woman had been
i drinking together heavily. This was in
I part confirmed by the condition in which
Almy was found early in the morning, be
ing fast asleep by the Bide of the corpse.
His story in brief is that, meeting* on
I Hotel street, they took a hired carnage
! to their home on Young street, had some
refreshments and later on in the evening
i took a drive, finally at a late hour bring-
I ing up at a private resortV where wine Is
I illicitly sold. Here they drank two bot
i tles of champagne, and reached home
| about 10 o'clock in the morning. The
I woman, he says, left him to visit other
I apartments in the house, and shortly after
I returning complained of feeling sick and
I being * in great pain. Although Almy
! thought there was nothing serious, he tel
! ephoned'to Dr. Miner, but telling him that
; he thought there was nothing much amiss.
In a few minutes, however, he became
; alarmed and telephoned again to the doc
tor to hurry. Dr. Miner responded at 2
\ o'clock, as promptly as possible, but the
; woman was already dead.
During his investigations Dr. Miner dis
covered a bottle which had contained the
poisonâ lysol; similar somewhat in its ef
fects to carbolic acid or creosote, which
had undoubtedly been the cause of the
death to judge from the scalded condition
of the eyes, mouth and throat of the de
ceased.
A Coroner's jury held an inquest and
after three hours returned the following
verdict: ' â  .' - tf:
"That Mrs. E. Almy came to her death
in Honolulu on the 7th day of July, 1889,
by taking poison administered by her own
hand." Â'..: â¢''"â â¢-_''
Street comments are unkind, and the
Independent has practically demanded an
; investigation by the Attorney General's
department, since neither the Marshal nor
the Coroner evinced any disposition to
i probe beyond the evidence offered the
j jury by Almy, the doctor and the hack
i driver.
It has leaked out that the police version
' or theory is the following: That Almy has
an undivorced wife in New York, unknown
to the deceased, whom he had promised to
marry. She came here, to induce him to
carry out that promise, and on the even-
I ing in question he started out with her
! with the Intention of being privately mar-
I ried. The sudden fear of the conse
] quences of a bigamous marriage led him
Ito again defer. Recriminations and prom
ises then led to the debauch and the death
! of the victim in despair.
The real name of the woman is be
' lieved to be Mrs. Edith Fuller. She went
i to Honolulu from this city in the brig
: William <*. Irwin, arriving there on the
j 10th of June. She and Almy were 7*ous

MOUNTAIN LION KILLED.
It Had Been Committing Depreda
tions on Carmel Ranches.
MONTEREY, July 20. -News has Just
been received here from Carmel of the
killing of one of the largest .mountain
lions ever seen In this section. The lion
had been committing depredations in tne
country around the Carmel Valley for
some time past, carrying off calves and
young pigs and greatly annoying ranchers
as well as causing alarm among the wo
men and children of the vicinity.
On Sunday night last the animal car
ried off a fine calf from the Pacific Im- .
provement Company's Laurellas rancho
and the next morning John Y. Hebbron,
superintendent of the ranch,' organized a
hunt party and taking a number of dogs
followed the trail of the lion. The trail
led up into a rocky cave-like place from
which as soon as the dogs entered
came ugly growlings. The attack of tne
dogs Infuriated the beast and he rushed
out of his den upon the hunters only to
be received with a volley of shots from
their guns. Ono shot struck him in a
vital spot and with a leap into the air
he fell over dead.
One of the dogs was killed and several
others badly injured during the fight in
side the den. The lion was skinned and
his pelt brought to town to be cured. It
ls a splendid specimen and Mr. Hebbron
I is very proud of his exploit.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, July 20.â The theo
retical and sentimental ideas of forest
preservation were to-day combated
by a practical and matter-of-fact prop
osition at the session of the American
Forestry Convention, being 'held in
this city.
Abbott Kinney, first vice-president
for California, presided. Upon the
desk before the chairman and on the
table of Secretaries George W. Whit
tlesey and W. H. Knight, were large
bouquets of eucalyptus blossoms in
many varieties of red, white, yellow
and green, notable exhibits of one
branch of the local association.
S. H. Woodbridge, Ph. D., read a
paper on "Water Conservation in
Soils." The speaker related the result
of his own experiments to show that
some varieties of soil absorb moisture
much more rapidly than do others, and
the natural mold of an old forest is th
best in every respect. The object of
the paper was to show the absolute
necessity of preserving forests that
protect the absorbent soil which serves
such a useful purpose in storing water.
The principal address of the sessions
was made-- by Ellwood Mead, formerly-
State engineer of Wyoming.- recently
appointed irrigation expert for the De
partment of Agriculture, on "The Fu
ture Policy for Irrigation in the West.
He prefaced his remarks by saying. he
had intended making his address ap
plicable to conditions here, but found
that he could do that only after mak
ing a personal investigation. The tenor
of the address was an unqualified in
dorsement of a proposal to lease for
grazing purposes all the public lands
and to use the money thus obtained in
the construction of storage reservoirs
and irrigating canals. He argued that
in regions where high freight rates
prevail it is folly to expect private en
terprise to engage in the great work of
storage reservoirs and Irrigation sys
tems. , , .
The morning session was opened by
the paper of A. Campbell Johnson on
"A Forest Experiment Station." read
by Secretary Whittlesey. The author
of this paper urged the establishment
of experimental stations and the sys
tematic planting of trees.
H. Hawgood, a well-known civil en
gineer, followed with a paper, "En
gineering Problems in Forestry and
Water Stor-vge." ; tftf-:.- ..;*"â¢
Wallace W. Everett, associate editor
of Wood and Iron, a San Francisco
publication, presented a paper on 'The

At the afternoon meeting John Mc-
Laren, spoke on "Reclamation of Drift

and showed how those erratic despoil
ers of landscape gardening were
brought into subjection by skillful
management, which could be as suc
cessful in other localities where unfer
tile sand predominates. .7 ;-:

LEADERS AT CHICAGO.
HARRISON
FACTION IS
VICTORIOUS
= -:*.-__: _H_ Dâ Â» The Call.
CHICAGO. July CO.â No friction de- '
veloped at the meeting of the Demo
cratic National Committee -day. ;
ar.d the men who made such bellig
erent assertions last night failed to make
them good to-day. Not a single warlike
note was sounded and no defiances were
uttered either by the men who demanded j
that "18 to 1" shall be the rallying cry j
In the next campaign or by those who op- j
pose its adoption.
The only movement made by the silver
men looking toward recognition by the
National Committee was during the after- ;
rt )oh, when the Ohio Valley Bimetallic
League was admitted to the committee- j
rooms, and James P. Tan-in of Kentucky,
acting as spokesman, read the resolutions
adopted by the committee earlier in the j
day at the Palmer House. These resolu- j
tions demanded that there be inserted in
the next Democratic national platform
planks opposing trusts and imperialism
and adhering to the silver ratio of 16 to L
"And along these lines we offer you our
a:d," said Mr. Tarvin. There was a de
fiant accent on the word "these" that
seemed to Imply that the support of the
bimetallists could be secured along no
other iir.es than those marked out, OUt Of
this the committee took no notice.
The Ohio Valley Bimetallic League was
courteously thanked for its proffer of as
sistance and assured that it would be
called upon at such times as the Na
tional Committee felt in need of its as
sistance. That was the beginning and end
of the silver episode.
The fight against P. J. Devlin, editor of
the Press Bureau of the National Com
mittee, was brought to a finish, the Har
rison faction of Illinois securing his de
position for the part taken by him as an
orhcer of the National Committee In the
last mayoralty election in Chicago.
Beyond making several changes in the
rules governing the committee, nothing
else was done during the day. Section 1
cf the rules, which prescribes the forma
tion of the National Committee, was so
amended as to permit the election of a
vice chairman, to act when the chairman
is unabie to be present. Upon the mo
tion of Mr. Clayton of Alabama, sections
2. S, 4, 5. .. 7. S. 9 and 10 of the rules were
stricken out. Section 2 provides for the
majority election of officers of the com
mittee.
Section 3 gave the chairman power to
appoint subordinate officers of the com
mittee with the concurrence of the ex
ecutive committee. Sections 4, 5 and 6
declared that the chairman, secretary and
treasurer of the committee, respectively,
should perform the duties of their posi
tions. Section 7 covered the formation of
the new National Committee and the re
lations that should exist between the in
coming and going organizations. Sec

tion â¢ empowered the chairman to call
meetings whenever he deemed it for they
best interests of the party. Section 9 pro
vided that the chairman shall cail a me> j t-
Ing upon the receipt of a written request
by one-fourth of the members of the com
mittee. Section 10 provided that the ses
sions cf the committee shall be governed
by general parliamentary law, and that
the committee shall adopt any standing
rule for the disposition of business coming
before it.
The fight bet*** the Illinois factions ;
began as soon as Mr. Bryan arrived in the
city, which was at S o'clock in the morn
ing. He was immedtateiy beset by men
of both sides, the Altgeld faction asking
him to be at the meeting without fail and ;
the Harrison men asking that he remain
away from the Auditorium altogether.
Mr. Br* an was in a dilemma and for a
long time would not declare himself as
being in favor of the meeting or not He
said he had accepted the invitation for
the meeting and there was no apparent
reason why be shouid decline at the last
moment at the demand of a politics :
faction host to that which had invited ,
him to the city. At the same time he ex
pressed himself as being anxious to avoid
anything that would create further fric
tion and as a remedy proposed that the
Altgeld people turn over the control of j
the meeting to the National Committee.
Mr. Altge" I was personally willing that
this should be done, but the majority of
his adherents, who are bitter against the
Harrison men, opposed it. and when the
alter heard that there was opposition to
the plan in the Altgeld camp they openly
championed the passing of the meeting
under the control of the National Com
mittee.
The arguments on both sides were hot
and fierce for several hours and there
seemed to be no chance of a settlement.
The large majority of the members of :
the National Committee declared them
selves as being opposed to having any
thins to do with the meeting in any way.
They maintained that they had a fight
before the committee at that moment
born of the outraged feelings of the Har
rison faction because it believed that the
National Committee had taken part In a
local matter without good reason, and
they were disposed to keep their hands
out of the present fight.
Finally Mr. Altgeld sent word to Mr.
Bryan that lf he considered that his at- i
tendance at the meeting would embarrass
him he could feel at perfect liberty to
remain away. The meeting could get
along without him. This message was ;
declared by the Altgeld people to bo one
of simple courtesy to Mr. "Bryan, but the
Harrison men declared that it was a mes- j
sage of sarcasm which meant that if Mr.
Bryan was afraid to keep his word to
j address the meeting it would be a sue- j
cess without his presence.
It was late ln the afternoon before Mr. j
; Bryan made up his mind to attend the ;
\ meeting. The Harrison people, who were j
; in good humor over the defeat of Devlin .
before the committee, finally announced
that he might attend the meeting with
out causing any hostility to himself in the I
Harrison camp. This message, however, j
had nothing to do with the conclusion
reached by Mr. Bryan regarding the j
meeting for he had decided to attend
before it reached him.
When the National Committee came to j
; order in the club room of the Sherman j
i House at 12 o'clock all the States were j
j represented either by proxy or by their j
j regular committeemen, with the excep- :
j tion of North Dakota, Oregon, Texas. |
Utah, Vermont. West Virginia and Ari
zona. Mr. Bryan held proxies for Michi- :
gan and South Dakota, and he was pres- :
ent throughout the meetings of the com
mittee although he did not take an active
part in the proceedings.
Ex-Governor Altgeld was offered the
firoxy of Committeeman White of Wash
ngton, but declined it. and Willis J. Ab
bott of New York acted for that State.
Mayor Harrison held the proxy for Alas
ka, but did not attend either session of the
committee.
As soon as Vie* Chairman Stone had
called the meeting to order Congressman
Ferguson of New Mexico was elected to
fill the vacancy from that Territory caused
by the resignation of F. A. Manxai
The chair then announced that it would
be in order to consider the question of ad
mitting the new member from Massachu
setts, Commit-- - Corcoran, a gold
: Democrat of that State, having protested
i against his removal to make room for
George Fred Williams. The matter was
settled in favor of the latter, who retained

The matter of rules was then taken up.
and Senator TP.im.an of South Carolina
moved an adjournment, as not all the
members of the committee were provided
with copies of the rules, and he objected
to further proceedings until they were
suDpiled.
Tne meeting then adjourned until 3:_o
oVinck. a recess of one and a half hours.
When the meeting reconvened Mayor
Rose of Milwaukee addressed the com
mittee inviting th* members to make a
visit to Milwaukee, and Wiley O. Cox. the
head of the delegation which is endeavor
ing- to secure the next Democratic con
vention for Kansas City, made a short
SDeech. setting forth the advantages of
Kansas Citj- as a convention city. No
action was taken by the committee re
garding the talk of Mr. Cox, as it had
been determined before the meeting was
called to order that the committee should
not at the present meeting rider any
thing relating to- the location of the next
convention.
Committeeman Norton of Ohio, who was
acting for Mr. McLean, the regular mem
ber from that State, then announced thai
the members of the Ohio Bimetallic
League were at the door and moved that
they be invited to enter and that Mr.
Tarvin of Kentucky, their chairman, be
asked to address the committee. The
motion was passed and the members of
the league were admitted.
Four thousand people crowded Into the
Auditorium to-night, despite the ------
ing heat, to attend the political meeting
given under the auspices of the Chicago
platform Democrats. It was from first to
last a silver meeting, an Altgeld meeting.
an anti-trust and an anti-expansion meet-
Ing. All cf the speakers save ex -Governor
Stone of Missouri, who was ill and talked
for less than two minutes, declared in
favor of 16 to 1 and against the war in the
Philippine Islands.
The speech of Mr. Bryan evoked great
enthusiasm among his hearers, especially
when he declared that the American Gov
ernment should pursue In Luzon the same
policy as was pursued in Cuba. The Phil
ippines, he said, came into our hands by
accident of war. and, being there, they
should have been treated on American
principles, and not on those practiced by-
European governments. The policy of the
United States, he claimed, should have
been to create a republic In the Philip
pines and ay to all the world, "Hands off,
and let that republic live. ' Mr. Bryan
also repeated his views on the silver ques
tion.
Among other speakers were Clarence S.
Darrow. James P. Tarv Senator Till

rowly escaped total destruction 'by a fire
fiend at midnight last --.* The blaze
originated In the Covelo feed and livery
stable, recently filled with hay and grain,
and in a few minutes it was beyond con
trol. When the hope of saving the stable
was abandoned the department devoted
all its efforts toward saving the adjoin
ing buildings. A hurriedly improvised
bucket brigade was brought Into play and
did heroic work. It was found necessary
to demolish two dwellings to prove* - fur
ther spreading of the fire. The chief
losses were: Frank Youree. owner of the
destroyed Youree block, insured in the
Norw-ich Union of London for JISOO, valued
at $+Â»'. the Covelo feed and livery- stable,
i also owned by Youree, insured In the Nor
wich Union; T. B. Henry, two dwellings.
covered with insurance in the Fireman's
Fund of San Francisco.
City Marshal Redwine has arrested Jo
seph Bradburn, a sheepherder and all
round tough cowboy, on a warrant charg
ing him with arson. Bradburn asserts his
innocence vigorously, but the authorities
claim they have strong evidence to sup
port the warrant. Bradburn is a "vindic
tive man. and while intoxicated yesterday
was refused whisky by Youree. and there
and then declared his intention of being
avenged. He is now confined in Jail and
shows apparently no fears of the outcome.
He prides himself upon his kin-hip with
JeÂ«3e James, the deceased outlaw. The
hearing comes up to-morrow.

NEW WHEELS PUT ON
â â¦ â
So the Journey Across the Conti
nent Will Be Resumed From
Utica This Morning.
BY JOHN D. DAVIS
UTICA. July 20.â We have repaired
everything here at the Weston-Mott
Factory^ which was placed at my dis
posal. The new rear wheels with
three-inch tires are on. and we lay
over to-night to permit the cement on
them to harden. We start at 4 a. m..
and will make as many miles as pos
sible, continuing all day. This morn
ing we ran up from Little Falls, twen
ty-flve miles, in two hours, with a
temporary wheel in place. All along
we were greeted by large crowds, and
farmers had Quit work in anticipation
of our coming.
To-night all Utica was out to see us
come from the factory down to the
hotel, and intense Interest has been
manifested by the best class of people.
GREAT INTEREST TAKEN
IN ONE SHORT RUN
UTTCA. July 20.â automobile which
is making a tour across the continent in
charge of John D. Davis arrived In Utica
this noon. Mr. Davis went to Little Falls
this morning at 7 o'clock, taking with
him a new wheel, which had been made
by the Weston-Mott Company of this city.
Davis was accompanied by Mrs. Davis
and F. G. Mott of the Weston-Mott Com
pany. On arriving in Little Falls the new
wheel was adjusted and as soon as_ pos
sible the start was commenced for Utica.
A crowd of fully 200 people gathered about
the Girvan House to see the automobile
start At S:so all was ready and Mr. and
Mrs. Davis and Mr. Mott in the '"â
began the run for Utica. The automobile
was accompanied by an expert machinist,
who rode alongside on a bicycle with his
eves and ears open for any trouble in the
working parts. The run between Little
Falls and Herkimer was made without
accident or event. The new wheel worked
perfectly and the motor acted better than
in several days. There was no, trouble
with heated pistons, as on Monday. The
party arrived in Herkimer at 20 minutes
to 10. A stop of half an hour was taken
to look over the machinery and to inflate
the tires. One of the wheels which re
ceived injury in the breakdown on Tues
day was found to have a defective tire.
The crack ln the rim had produced a
strain In the rubber and the tire leaked
badly, necessitating frequent blowing up.
At a quarter after 10 al! was in readiness
again and the trip was resumed. The
roads between Herkimer and Frankfort
were found in bad condition, as in fact all
the roads in this sect were. Davis said
the little hills did not bother him so much,
but the roadbeds were rough and full of
mudholes. At Frankfort it was found nec
essary to again stop a few minutes and in
flate the tires, after which no further in
convenience was experienced before arriv
ing in Utica. w nen Mr. Davis passed the
Masonic Home the. carriage was moving
along at about eight or nine miles an
hour. The carriage was the object of con
siderable attention. The automobile was
taken to the Weston-Mott Works and the
new set of rear wheels which had been
manufactured according to Mr. Davis' di
rection were adjusted. This operation con
sumed much more time than was expected.
Mr. and Mrs. Davis started to leave
Utica this afternoon, but were obliged to
return because the cement on the new
tires had not been hardened enough. He
will positively leave to-morrow morning at
i o'clock. He expects to reach Syracuse
in the forenoon. On their arrival in
Cleveland the carriage will be fitted with
an entire new. set of wheels specially de
signed to meet the demands of Eastern
roads.

ELTRINGHAM TO
STAND TRIAL FOR
CLARK'S MURDER
Public Sympathy Is With Him, as
Many Consider the Deed
Justifiable.
SAN* ANDREAS. July 20.â Henry Eltringham will be tried for murder, or.^ at
least, he will have a. preliminary examination on that charge. La-*- Monaay
morning Eitrir.gham killed John W. Clark, claiming that the mart had
drugged his wife with morphine and assaulted her. The testimony given at
the inquest Monday was to the effect that Eltrlngham had fired two shots from
a Winchester rifle a: Clark just as the latter turned the corner of the buildmg in
his rush to escape the infuriated miner. The body was found lying in acorat.
or the fence some distal from the house, on Its left ride The ball entered the
right side, shattering the heart and going out at a point directly over J>r
*__**. It Is claimed that with such a wound death must have been instantaneous
and that the mar. could not have run the distance to where his body was fount
It is now said also that Clark and Mrs. Eltringham were seen in company at
Angels Camp during the celebration on July 4 and those who are fond of build
ing theories say the woman at that time gave the ex-volunteer soldier en.our
-1 *_.. to visit her at Valleclto. It will be remembered that Joseph Ba.to and
John Bat* the father and brother of Mrs. Eltringham. were by a preconcerted ar
rangement present at the killing. Both were armed, though they afterward said
they had no thought of killing the man. The three men-Eltringham. and the
Santos-approached the house the morning of the shooting from three -separate
directions Â«f No one besides _Â« men and Mrs. Eltringham witnessed the snoot
ing and the four stories do not exactly harmonize. Another startling theory - 3
that Clark knew Mrs. Eltringham prior to her marriage to I ' .ham. Some
words Â£ fall by the woman during her examination at the Coroner's Inquest
would seem to make this theory possible. _Â.ââ
At the Dreliminary examination next week It may be charged that Eltring
ham was determined "to kill Clark and " '-'- his father-in-law and brother-in- aw
conspired with him to this end. Whatever be the facts adduced public s>m
plthv is now with the Eltringhams. The majority of the people openly express
th. opinion that Eltringham could have been justified in laying a trap and killing
'"â¢' deliberately if the .--.- really drugged and assaulted the woman or even
Sokadvar.l_e of her weak-minded condition to accomplish his purpose. Of the
Â£tt_. _aÂ« -Tleast. there is very little doubt. It is probable that Mrs. Eltring
ham win be nlaced in an asylum, her condition since the shooting being one of
to__ mental irresponsibility. She was for a while an inmate of the Stockton
Asylum before her marriage.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW TORK. July 20.â A Washing
ton special to the Herald says: An im
portant exchange of notes relating to
the establishment of a modus Vivendi
temporarily defining the Alaskan
boundary line took place between the
British and American. Governments to
day.
While the secrecy observed by the of
ficials makes it impossible to obtain ex
act Information regarding th contents
of the notes, it can be stated authori
tatively that the communication from
Lord Salisbury is the answer of Great
Britain to* a proposition advanced by
the United States four weeks ago. that
the line, be placed two miles north of
Kluckwan.
The British Government does not ac
cept the proposition, but has submitted
further proposals for the consideration
of this Government.
Late this afternoon Mr. Tower, who
has charge of the British Embassy
here called at the State Department
and had a conference with Secretary
Hay. Upon its conclusion I was in
formed that a formal answer had_ been
made to the British proposals, and that
the United States is Tying out the
decision reached some days ago,
strengthened -'.- the report of senator
Fairbanks, chairman of the American
representation on the high Joint com
mission, and had declined to withdraw
from the line it has established as that
which is fair to both countries.
As a result of the exchange of notes
to-day the authorities are most hopeful
that an agreement establishing a tem
porary boundary line will be reached.
The failure of the British Government
to answer the administration's .pro
posal caused the authorities to believe
that negotiations were at an end and
the communication from Lord Salis
bury, which is said to be more satis
factory- than any preceding It. revives
the hope that something may yet be
done. Negotiations are in a very deli
cate stage, but Secretary Hay is hand
ling them carefully. It is believed he
will ultimately be able to bring about
a settlement of the matter.
The Secretary was again in confer
ence with Senator Fairbanks regarding
the boundary question and the work of
the commission. In view of the Sec
retary's acquaintance with the views
of other members of the commission
regarding pending questions, it has
been decided that It will be unneces
sary- for the entire American represen
tation to meet. After the Cabinet
meeting to-morrow it is expected that
the Secretary and the Senator will con
fer relative to the advisability of post
poning indefinitely the date of the re
assembling of the commission, or of
fixing a definite date when it shall re

Shortly After the Pair Were
Seen to Go Into the
Place,
__$_Â£_ "Dispatch, to The Call.
PORTLAND. July 20.â Clara Fitch,
the handsome IS-year-old daughter of
George A. Fitch, living at Grand ave
nue and East Irving streets, was stran
gled to death last night in a little park
on the East side, known as Cycle Park.
Frank McDaniel. a truck driver, whose
father lives at Santa Barbara, Cal., is
under arrest for the crime.
Late this afternoon a young man
passing in the direction of the park,
which is really a large clump of trees,
found the body. It lay face downward
in a secluded opening. Broken fern and
trampled grass indicated a struggle.
There were no marks of violence on the
body, though the tongue protruded.
Absence of marks of violence la ac
counted for by the fact that the girl,
the evening being cool, wore a high
thick velvet "choker." which neck cov
ering is fashionable now.
The identity of the dead girl was not
established until several hours after the
body was brought to the Morgue.
Detectives were set to work and soon
learned that Miss Fitch had been keep
ing company with McDaniel, but his
presence in her home had been forbid
den by her parents. It was soon learned
that she met him by appointment one
block from her home about dark last
night and they walked together in the
direction of Cycle Park, about a mile
distant.
McDaniel after his arrest freely ad
mitted having met her and walked
with her to the park, but asserted that
he escorted her back to within a block
of her home, where he left her about
11 o'clock. The manner of telling his
story left little doubt in the minds of
the detectives that he is guilty. A
woman living near the park heard a
scream from the direction where the
body was found about 10 o'clock last
night, but as it was not repeated she
paid no further attention to it.
The physicians began an autopsy at
10 o'clock this evening, but the result of
their investigation will be withheld
frorn^ the public till to-morrow. The
post-mortem had not been finished at
12:30 a. m. It is given out that there
is evidence of assault before the mur
der was committed The girl's father
is a locomotive engineer on the South
ern Pacific and will be in on his run
to-morrow morning. The mother was
prostrated to-day on account of her
daughter's absence from home last
night, and the news of the murder, by
the physician's order, has not been
communicated to her.
FARMERS SUFFER FROM
GOVERNMENT'S NEGLECT
The Sacramento River Becomes
Choked and Navigation Is
Impeded.
RED BLUFF, July 20.â Neglect of
the Government In having work done
on the Sacramento River has resulted
in a great loss to farmers of Tehama
County because of the foul condition of
the stream. The Sacramento Trans
portation Company has notified the
people that It will not be able to run
its boats north of the town of Tehama
until after a rise in the river. Through
the efforts of Congressman Geary, sev
eral years ago, the channel was cleacred
of snags and deepened on the riffles,
which resulted in the river being navi
gated and freight rates to Red Bluff
being greatly reduced. Since that time,
although the Seizer has lair, at the
wharf at Sacramento for many months
at a time, nothing has been done to
keep, the river open, and now farmers
of Tehama County must suffer the
penalty for the gleet of the Govern
ment in protecting their Interest.
Cooley's Odd Will.
SANTA ROSA, July 20.â "1 desire to be

drawers and socks and interred in a
casket costing not to exceed $40. to be
buried by the Masonic fraternity from the
house ln which I may die. and that my
grave be dug in Riverside Cemetery so
that the box in which the casket is placed
may touch that In which my dear wife
was interred." The above paragraph is
the first of the last will and testament of
the late Charles H. Cooley, the well
known Cloverdale pioneer, which was
filed for probate here this afternoon. The
estate disposed of is a large on* and
through the entire will the same attention
to detail has been observed. William T.
Brush. Conrad Hall and T. B. Wilson are
named as appraisers and the salary* to
be allowed them is fixed at i' per day.
J. B. Cooley and A. E. Copley are named
as executors. The will fixes their com
pensation at $2 50 per day and no more.
Explicit Instructions concerning the erec

the wording to be placed on the shaft.

JONES IS BUSTLED OUT OF
THE RING BY JEFFORDS.
.
Stays Down Ten Seconds in the Fifth
Round and a Burlesque Bout
Is Awarded the White
Man-
George Green defeated Charley Goff in
the nineteenth round of their light in the
arena of the National Athletic Club,
"Woodward's Pavilion, last night. The
end came unexpectedly, Green himself
for just an Instant being as surprised ns
the spectators. The beginning of the end
was scented by those in attendance in tile
eighteenth round. Green swung his left
and, landing, knocked Goff to his knees.
He staved down the limit and upon ris
ing was again knocked down. The bell
saved him, as Green was full of fight.
When the gong clanged for the nine
teenth round Golf's brain had not cleared
sufficiently and Green soon broke down
his guard. He rained a perfect torrent of
blows upon Goff, but none touched a vul
nerable spot. Goff clinched to avoid pun
ishment and the men struggled all over
the ring. The spectators were in a perfect
frenzy of excitement, all being on their
feet and yelling encouragement to the
tired boxers. In one of the rushes across
the ring Green stumbled it the rope and
pitched headlong out of the ring to the
tloor. Goff at the same time fell to his
knees from exhaustion.
Willing hands fairly tossed Green into
the ring and the men went at it again,
exchanging blow for low . At this time
each seemed to have a chance to win.
Both were tired and clinched again. Green
being wrestled to the ropes. When they
broke Goff backed away, Green following.
Green swung his left and although Goff
seemed just out or inge the glove
reached the delicate nerve center at the
front of the chin. Goff's hands dropped
to his side, his nerves seemed paralyzed
iind refused to support his swaying body.
Green was lick to see his advantage
and stepping in, placed a crushing rignt
oil the jaw.
Goff dropped like a log and lay uncon
scious on the canvas door of the ring.
The counting of ten. seconds was a mere
formality, as the defeated man did not
move a muscle. When Goff fell Green
took one look at him and then walked
away, knowing he would be returned the
victor. When Goff had been counted out,
Green went to his assistance and helped
to lift him from the door. The van
quished man did not revive readily, and
it was some time before he could leave
tne ring.
There were several periods of the light
when Green looked a certain loser. Goff
dazed him, but did not follow up his ad
vantage, thus giving Green a much
needed opportunity to collect his scattered
thoughts. Green was aggressive through
out, playing aim entirely tor the body,
working his left hand unceasingly on
Golf's stomach. Goff's blows at times
lacked direction, his vicious right and left
swings going wide of their mark.
Green hadj a load at rst, but this was
overcome by Goff, who in turn had the
advantage. The men hit In th, clinches
and the epeetators took sides as to which
man was doing the alleged fouling. Ac
cording to the rules the men could hit
with one arm free. This they did through
out, neither having any the better of the
arrangement.
Green was attended by Bob McArthur,
Frank Foster and "Danny" Needham;
while "Billy" Madden and "Jimmy" Law
lor cared for Goff. 11. B. Cook made nia
reappearance as referee. He wore a
long Prince Albert coat, the clerical ap
pearance of which, was offset by a rakish
cap. Billy Jordan did not act ai announc
er, his place being taken by D. V. Denehy.
The lirst attraction was a burlesque. It
was billed as a twenty-round bout be
tween Jim Jeffords of Sonora, who wanted
to stay four rounds with Champion Jim
Jeffries recently, and Bob Jones, a colored
"phenom" from lx>s Angeles.
Both men ere willing enough and In
good condition, but neither apparently had
a good punch in him, and Jones put' him
self out in the fifth by a fall over the
ropes.
In what fighting was done Jeffords led
from the start save in the fourth round,
when the colored man did most of the
mixing.
Jeffords opened the first with a pair of
wild swings at head and ribs; he missed
both but the colored man retired to a post
and with his head under his arm permit
ted the Sonora man to hammer him wild
ly until the bell signaled the end of the
round.
Jones undoubled for a moment in the
second with a swing for the jaw and Jef
fords replied with a misdirected upper
cut and then put his right and left on the
Los Angeleno's ribs and jaw. Jones ma
behind the post again, while Jeffords re
sumed his tattoo on the ribs.
Not more than one blow in half a dozen
found anything more substantial than the
smoky atmosphere. Jeffords time "and
again had his man at his mercy, but could
not land on him. The drubbing he did
get the darky took good-hum â¢ but
made little effort to get back until the
fourth round, when he unlimbered his
right for two jabs on the heart and a
vicious swing on the point of the jaw. He
found the heart again and Jeffords inter
rupted matters with an awkward clinch,
which Jones broke with the right and left
twice on the head. Jeffords closed the
round with a fierce straight on the chin.
The fifth round put the crowd in too
good humor to jeer. Jeffords opened It
with a series of â â 'â¢ lid swings hat resulted
In nothing more serious than a laugh from
the crowd; he followed it with others like
It, and Jones made a run for his post.
Jeffords rooted him out with a bunch of
nestling swats on the ribs and the terrified
Jones fled for the opposite corner. The

Special Dispatch to The Call.
SOUTHAMPTON. July 20.â Thomas
Lipton, owner of the Shamrock, was in
terviewed to-day regarding the damage, if
any, sustained by the Shamrock in
grounding off South Sea at the conclusion
of yesterday's trial race with the Britan
nia. Sir Thomas said:
"We are so convinced that yesterday's
grounding of the Shamrock was perfect
ly harmless that we are not even going
to have tlie yacht examined.
"The Shamrock will forthwith be rigged
for her trans-Atlantic voyage, upon which
she will sail as soon as possible, I hope by
the end of this month. After the trial
races this week both Mr. Fife and myself
were convinced that the Shamrock is a
magnificent vessel and the fastest ever
seen on this side of the ocean. The way
in which she ran away from the Britannia
proves that she is not merely the better
boat, but an except) fine racer. you
must ember she was not seen at her
best either day. Tuesday she did not
carry as much canvas as the Britannia,
while yesterday she had a smaller main
sail than It is Intended she shall carry.
We can set a much larger mainsail In the
coming contests if ii should be deemed
advisable. We are satisfied that If yes
terday's race had been completed the
challenger would have won by half an
hour. The Shamrock has realized Mr.
Fife's fullest anticipations, and I myself
am mere than satisfied.
"Of course, l cannot show how the Sham
rock compares with the Columbia, but we
are satisfied that we have a game boat,
and calculating by her performances
against the Britannia and the latter's
against the Vigilant and the Valkyrie, we
expect to make at least a good showing."
Sir Thomas Lipton added: "I would like
to reiterate through the Associated Press
my heartiest appreciation of the manner
in which the Americans have conducted
all negotiations. They have acted
throughout ilk, sportsmen, and If 1 had
made all the arrangements myself I could
not have drawn up more satisfactory reg
ulations. As the Prince of Wales said
with emphasis after Tuesday's contest
when expressing the highest admiration
of the Shamrock at dinner on board th(
Erin, 'I hope the best boat may .but
In any case I know, Sir Thomas, that you ]
will be sure of meeting fail play from our
American friends and that the contest for
the America's cup will be can out on
both sides in the true sporting spirit, with
love of justice.'
"In reply 1 assured the Prince of Wales
that the support he had given and the i
keen Interest he had manifested in tho
challenger had been the greatest stimulus
and the greatest encouragement in view
of the peculiar circumstances of the chal- i
lenge." tftf'
It appears that the Prince of Wales ex
perienced much trouble in boarding the
Britannia yesterday morning. A choppy
sc-a was running at the time and waves
surged up between the Britannia an the
launch carrying the Prince, drenching his
Royal Highness to the skin. He persist
in his purpose, however, and finally board
ed the yacht, though his attendants were
most anxious; as they feared that he
might again sprain his knee, which is still
weak, in jumping aboard.
It is report",! that the New York Yacht
Club has consented to tlie Shamrock be
ing towed by the Erin in the event of be
ing becalm In crossing the Atlantic.
Two strong hawsers are being made at
Cowes for use ill this event.
The Shamrock is a mere shell and quito
empty below her deck. When the Prince
of Wales boar her and went below he
found himself in a vessel destitute -en of
ordinary partitions, and, looking from end
to end, he said In a surprised way: "Why,
she's like a street, perfectly empty."
The correspondent of the Associate*!
Press had an Interview to-day with Cap
tain Carter, who besides Bailing the Brit
annia commanded the Qenesta when suc
cessful in American waters. When told
that Sir Thomas Lip ton would have won
by half an hour yesterday Captain Carter
replied: "Yes, I believe she would. She
is a splendid boat, With regard to the
criticism that she did not sail so well as
mignt have been expected before the wind,
it must be remembered that she carried
only her small topsail. Nobody will be
more pleased than myself to see the
Shamrock win. The Prince of Wales was
undoubtedly delighted to have the Sham
rock prove such a flyer, as we want to
capture the America's cup if we can.
Without the slightest doubt the Shamrock
is magnificent in beating to windward. '
Captain Carter, who has no sympathy
with the policy of enveloping the Sham
rock in a fog of mystery", said that the
Americans have shown that they have
nothing to learn from Great Britain in the
building of racing yachts. "There was no
need to wrap up the Shamrock In petti
coats. The Americans probably know as
much about her as they desire."
The Shamrock sailed for the Clyde this
afternoon.
Sonoran held him up half way. adminis
tered another series of vicious misses and
shoved him through the ropes.
He landed on his Dack at the edge of the
platform, started to get up, but thought
better of it, and lav down again until
counted out. The decision was given to
Jeffords. <

Pictures of Volunteers.
The Wasp this week contains a number
of very handsome illustrations of the re
ception of the Oregon volunteers. The
society racing at Burlingame is also de
pleted. The quarrel between the Federal
quarantine authorities and the State of
ficials and the Agnewa Asylum scandal
furnish material for strong cartoons. The
theaters are written up in breezy style
and the doings of the financial world
tersely reviewed. One of the most amus
ing things in this week's number is a
satire on .the enterprise of the alleged
monarch of the dailies in claiming credit
for having rescued the marooned egg
hunters on the Faraliones. The stories,
editorials, etc., In the Wasp are, as usual,
very bright and readable.

SOME MAGNIFICENT RACING
AT DETROIT.

In the First Heat of the 2:08 Trot
The Abbot Lowers the Season's
Record From 2:10
to 2:07 1-2.
Speclal Dispatch to The Call.
DETROIT, Mich., July 20.â Again the
unexpected happened in the Merchants'
and Manufacturers' $10, trotting stake.
This afternoon Royal Baron, a compara
tive outsider, became the winner of the
rich prize. Bui it was not won without
effort, for never was there a finer struggle
In a horse race than the one put up by
King Mond, who, won two of the heats |
and finished second in the other five. '
SIDE LIGHTS AT THE NATIONAL ATHLETIC CLUB BOXING.
The meeting of George Green and Charley Goff at Woodward's Pavilion last night resulted in a victory for the Call
fornlan. In the nineteen rounds which the bout lasted there was a lot of stiff punching, the tide of battle"" favoring each
in turn. The preliminary between Jeffords and Jones was a burlesque, neither displaying any science. The colored man
was wrestled to the floor in the fifth round and remained down until counted out. â¢ ,;::
Royal Baron is a six-year-old bay horse,
bred by Colonel Stoner of Kentucky, and
is tie property of N. W. Hubinger of
New Haven. He was nominated for the
race by A. J. Hans of Johnstown, Pa,,
deceased, from whose estate Mr. Hub
inger purchased him. Up to yesterday
when he won one M. and M. heat in - : 14*
his best mark was 2:23 V
To top off an afternoon of magnificent
racing in the first heat of the 2:08 trot
The Abbot lowered the season's trotting
record from 2:10, made by Surpol on Tues
day, to 2:o7'^.
The first money won by Royal Baron
amounts to 15460. A $2000 consolation will
be trotted Saturday.
When the Merchants' and Manufactur- j
ers' stake was called at 12:35 o'clock the ,
four heat winners of yesterday and three !
I less fortunate horses faced Starter Ilayt.
After scoring for the fifth time they were j
; given the word and King Mond went out
in front and stayed there, winning all the
way, although Success was always close
enough to be dangerous. Before the next
heat all but the four heat winners were
withdrawn. Just as they were sent away
King Mond broke and before he got down
the others obtained a good lead. The
j Queen cut out the going until thee turned
Into the last quarter, when Royal Baron
came with a rush, took the lead and held
it, finishing a half-length in front of King .
Mond, who had again caught the bunch.
Despite his. having broken, King Mond
kept In front in the final heat from the I
' first eighth to the three-quarters, when
Royal Baron's rush again came Into cvi
! dence and landed him under the wire a
head to the good. Amid the cheers of
more than 8000 people present the winner
was led away covered with a beautiful
blanket of flowers.
The final heat of the 2:07 class pace, un- ;
finished last night, was won in the fast |
time of 2:07*4 by Sherman Clay. Bel Esprit
in the 2:07 trot had no trouble in winning.
Edith W lost the first heat of the 2:12
; pace to Fanny Dillard, but after that she j
was not In danger.
The Abbot was favorite In the fast trot
| ting class, and Justified his selection.
Geers captured the first heat with one of
! his famous drives In the stretch. When
1 The Abbot broke before the tlrst eighth
. in the next heat it put him out for the
'< time being, but in the last two he was as
â  steady as clockwork and won both. Geers
afterward explained that Kentucky
Union's Bulky had bumped into him.
After three heats of the 2:15 pace had
1 gone to three different horses the Judges
I postponed it until to-morrow on account
lof darkness. Summaries:

DID THIS MAN
COMMIT SUICIDE.
Â£-_-_*, HE police have the mysterious
disappearance of a resident of
Santa Barbara on their hands
( J, and up to the present all their
efforts to obtain a trace of him
have been futile. The man is Albert
A. Van Voorhies, a nickel-in-the-slot
machine agent.
About a week ago Chief Dees re
ceived a tetter frm A an Voorhies' wife.
in which she wrote that her husband
left Santa Barbara on the' night of
June 15 on ' the steamer Corona for
Astoria, Or., taking with him six or
seven machines. He was a sick man,
being troubled with his head and was
not able to do laborious work. He was
last heard from a few days after he
left, having written the following let
ter from fort Harford on Juno 16:
"Darling Wife: The Corona stays
here til! 11 a. m. The Santa Rosa Is
lying on the north side of the dock
It is very dark and foggy here. I coulc
not tell you by word, love, but 3-ot
must know. It's over, all over. Yot
are free. I am no more. Good-by anc
God bless you. Yours till we meet or
high. Your husband, Albert A. Var
Voorhies, has gone, that's all."
On receipt of this startling letter
Mrs. Van Voorhies made Inquiry at the office of the steamship company, but
her husband's name was not on the passenger list, and she came to the con
clusion that for some reason he had given an assumed name. She felt sure
he had not deserted her. as a kinder man never lived. She and his mother
thought he might have come to this city and committed suicide or been
taken suddenly ill and dying for want of proper attendance. He baa an un
cle in Sacramento of the same name. He weighs about 160 pounds, ls 5 feet
8 Inches tall, rather light hair, mustache and brown eyes.
Z The police at once started an investigation, but could find no trace of
the missing man either along the water front or in any of the city hos
pitals. Three of tfie slot machines came here on the steamer Corona, but as
no one claimed them, they were stored with the Pacific Transfer Company.
ROOD DOBLE, THE
NOTED REINSMAN,
IN A NEW ROLE
Will Develop Cali
fornia Horses.
â Â« â
TO BE SOLD IN THE EAST
â â¦ â
ESTABLISHES HEADQUARTERS
AT GILROY TRACK.
â¦
Twenty-Eight Trotters and Pacers,
Purchased From A. B. Spreckels,
the Material Upon Which
He Will Work.
Budd Doble, the most widely known
trottlng-horse driver in the world, has
embarked in a venture which will be
â¢watched with interest hy all persons in
terested in horses, and especially by all
Californians. He lias purchased from A.
B. Spreckels twenty-eight lead of horses,
Including trotters and pacers.
These he will develop according to his
own methods and will fit them for the
Eastern market. The best will naturally
find their way to the tracks, while the
others will make excellent road horses
for the gentlemen drivers. The breeding
is all that can be desired. Nine are by
Cupid, fourteen by Aptos Wilkes, four
by Dexter Prince and one by Wildnut.
As to ages, twelve are three-year-olds,
twelve four-year-olds, while four are five
year-olds. Their dams were all carefully
selected, some being by Speculation, oth
ers by Dexter Prince and the remainder
by Abbotsford.
They have all been broken to harness
and then turned out without further han
dling, so that Doble will have the oppor
tunity of forming their habits. The vet
eran relnsman has selected the Gilroy
racetrack as headquarters and all the
work on the horses will be done there.
"I feel proud of the horses," said Mr.
Doble last night. "'ln all my experience
I never saw a higher class of horses bred
by one owner. Mr. Spreckels has used
excellent judgment in his selection of
sires, not hesitating to go outside his own
farm in order to blend some great speed
line with those of the horses on his own
farm."
The name of Budd Doble la Inseparably
linked with the story of the development
of the American trotter. Ten times he
has driven a horse in record time for the
mile, the standard of speed in trotters.
Dexter, Goldsmith Maid and Nancy
Hanks were the equine stars with which
he accomplished the feat. In all Mr.
Ddble has spent the working days of
thirty-four years in the sulky, in which
time he has sat behind the most famous
trotters in 'he world.
J. D. Redding Arrives.
Joseph D. Redding arrived in the city
from New York night before last and
went to Meeker's Grove yesterday to at
tend the midsummer high jinks of the
Bohemian Club. He will sojourn In Cali

AWARDING OF THE PRIZES
MR. FITHIAN'S GENEROUS ACT
TO COMPETITORS.
Visiting Members of the National
Educational Association Take
Great Interest in the
Exhibition.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SANTA BARBARA, July 20.â Such a
dog show as the one now in progress has
probably never been witnessed. It cer
tainly Is unprecedented on this coast. It
Is ostensibly a dog show, but In reality
it is an adjourned meeting of the National
Educational Association Convention.
The corridors of the Arlington Hotel,
which is the headquarters of the exhibi
tors, are crowded all day long with school
teachers learning canine lore from the
dog men. It is quite a unique experience
for the habitues of the bench shows to
hear talk about haws, couplings, briskets
and flanks tailing glibly from the mouths
of fair pedagogues, who seem as enthusi
astic as the exhibitors themselves.
The judging of the regular prizes was
concluded to-day and to-morrow the ex
hibition will terminate with the bestowal
of the special prizes.
In connection with these one very
sportsmanlike act is worthy of special
mention. R. B. Flthian, who offered a
very handsome silver cup for the best ter
rier owned in Santa Barbara County, won
the special himself, and then offered it
for the best terrier in the show. It was
awarded to G. L. Waiting's Sweet William
amid th,- plaudits of the spectators at
Mr. Fithian's generous and thoroughly
sportsmanlike action.
Quite a sensation was caused by the ap
pearance In the Judging ring of William
ooth, Chihuahua dog. It is by Don
Juan de Chihuahua, out of Juanita. The
"monster" weighed 28*4 ounces and was
entirely covered from view when held in
his proud owner's hand.

WILL RACE FROM
BURLINGAME TO
PALACE HOTEL
Novel Contest of Gen
tlemen Riders.
â â â¦ â
A STRANGE SPORTING MATCH
â â¦ â
DAN MURPHY OFFERS A VAL
UABLE SILVER TROPHY.
â¦
Each Rider Will Enter Four Horses,
and Lots Will Then Be Drawn
to Determine Who Will
Use Them.
As an outcome of a discussion among 1
j a group of Burlingame Country Club men
a novel race has been arranged which
promises to be one of the most remark
able ever held here. The route will be
from the cluhhouse at Burlingame to the
courtyard of the Palace Hotel In this city,
a distance of twenty miles. The clever
amateur horsemen already involved in
the good-natured controversy are:
Walter S. Hobart. Harry SimÂ©ki_B.
Charles "Dunphy. Joe Tobln Jr.
Pete-r Martin. F. J- Carolan.
Ollie Tobln. Richard Tobln.
Joseph S. Tobln.
The race itself will be a memorable one,
but the conditions under which it will be
run add to its novelty. In the first place
Dan Murphy, who is a patron of all gen
tlemanly sports, has offered a valuable
cup for the person who finishes first. In
addition to this the winner will receive
all the entrance money, which is expect
ed to total $1000. These sporting matches
i are common in Europe, where all manner
of odd conditions are imposed upon the
competitors.
It is the novel conditions in this in
stance which will add to the interest of
i the race. If the competitors used what
; ever horses they chose to enter a few of
them could draw upon the racetrack for
their steeds and Interest in the race would
be lost. It has been determined, in order
to obviate this, that each contestant shall
enter four horses, each to go five miles.
These -.-.ill all be named and slips bearing
the names will be placed in a hat. The
riders will then put their fate to the test,
each drawing four slips.
In order to add to the excitement some
blanks will l""' included among the names
of the tried horses. These so-called
blanks will. In reality represent mules
and coach horses, quadrupeds not really
ridden under saddle. Alter the draw each

ANDERSON CRITICIZES
PHILIPPINE CAMPAIGN
Says He Could Have Finished the
War With His Own Divi
sion.
CHICAGO, July 20.â special to the
Tribune from Cincinnati says: Briga
dier General Thomas M. Anderson,
who is at the St. Nicholas, said to-day:
I believe that if we had not been
held back I could have finished the war
with my own division and General
Lawton, who relieved me, is of the
same opinion.
The trouble is that we fellows went
over there to fight, while there werÂ«
others who attended to the politics and
diplomacy.
The only time that General Otis and
myself disagreed was on this point. 1
held that the war should be pushed ta
completion, while his policy was still
that of conciliation.

A warrant issued In Oakland yesterday

torney, says he has been the legal adviser !
of McPherson for two years, and oil hat j
ground refuses to discuss thy enterprises
concerned in the large amount of m -,[â¢-.'' i
sued for by his client. The fact is that
McPherson is suspected to have once I
projected :_i extensive scheme for the im- I
portation of unstamped opium here, and
it is known that he interested several
well-known gentlemen in his enterprise
and induced them to put up large sums of
money to assist it. And there is the poa -
sibility that the present warrant has been !
issued against a fictitious personage for
no less a purpose lan to compel the !
prominent federates of the astute
â¢'Brick" to show further confidence in
the opium venture by assisting him to -
maintain himself until the first cargo of '
"dope" arrives and is successfully land-,
cd. For up to date "Brick's" opium im
portations have been purely "nip--- 'â 
dreams" within his own active fancy,
and the shareholders have not received
any dividends on their Investments
"Brick" ems to have exercised a hyp
notic influence over several well-known
merchants and professional men who
while disclaiming any interest in his al
leged ilk-gal enterprise, have advanced
him large sums of me- ey within the past
few years for purpos. which they prac
tic-ally decline to tine.
Meanwhile tbere is no person living in i
Oakland named Thomas R. Davis, and no
arrest has been made. The real intent of
the warrant remains to be seen. "Brick"
refuses to discuss it, and when an at- :
tempt was made to see him last evening
he committed the paradox of declaring
in stentorian tones that "he was out."
Although extremely' shrewd and gener
ally working his victims into complica
tions where exposure of one would result
in exposure of all. "Brick" was once sent
across the bay for one year. The little
game which made him a gentleman of
leisure for twelve months was worked on
Marcel maris. McPherson convince. 1
Demaris that he had a large stock of fur
niture, obtained from the School Depart
ment. The stock, he claimed, was worth
Sl2.ooo.fbut it was necessary that he first
make a payment thereon of S2OO. De
maris. on a promise of a share in the
profits, advanced the $200, hut as the wait :
for the proilts seemed long, he began to
investigate and found that th- stock ln j
(â ucsTicn was but one of the mind and the
owner thereof the possessor of an itch
ing palm. In consequence, - maris laid i
information against "Brick." He was
convicted and sent to San Quentin for
the term named. .
In Mai of IS!. McPherson was dis
charged from the penitentiary', but it soon
became general rumor that his confine-" j
ment had failed to reform him. In the |
letter part of 1895 he made himself con- j
si icuous by taking a shot at himself in i
Pis home on Filbert street, near Jones.
The bullet ripped a furrow through his
skull! but his scheming brain was left
intact. During his necessary confinement j
pending the healing of the wound it was
made known to him that there were a !
few gullible persons left In town who â 
were yearning for his acquaintance. 'mis
settled his thoughts of a narrow bed be
neath the sod. He organized new schemes
and. as stated, interested well-known peo
ple in them. j
But, strangely enough, these alleged vic
tims hesitate to announce themselves as
such and yet protest that they have noth
ing to do with any wicked designs upon
the Federal revenue, which, according to
a thriving rumor. "Brick" is said to have
entertained.
Among the stanch friends of the ex
convict is Harvey Brown, the attorney.
He was seen last night with reference to
a published statement that he had been
victimized by "Brick."
At first he declined to talk at all be
cause he is McPhers. attorney. Finally
he decided to talk a little.
"I have been Mr. Mcpherson's attorney
for several years." he said. "In that
time I advanced him about $5000. He
never told me .- hat he wanted the money
:for. I never asked him for a receipt or
for security, but I wish you would not
state that fact. I relied upon his honor
to pay it hack. I haven't received the
money yet. but I ope to and I have
every confidence in his honor. I must de
cline to. discuss the character of his busi
ness. I don't remember that he ever told
me what it was. I do not desire to answer
whether his business is Or has beet! legiti
mate or otherwise. I don't think the pub
lic lias any right to know anything about
it. 71 never had anything to do with any
of his ventures. 1 loaned him the money
because 1 had reason to think that the
result of his enterprises would more than
pay me back, I have confidence in him
and think l will be paid."

Pherson's ways Is Attorney Isaac N. I

THE Pension Department at
Washington, D. ('.. has an
nounced the appointment of
|i Drs. Joseph G. Crawford and
Joseph H. Soper to be pension
examining surgeons in this city. They
were appointed to succeed Drs. Joseph
Peseta and Max Magnus; and together
with Dr. Denis F. Ragan, who holds
over, will constitute the board, whose
duty will be to pass upon the merits
of all applicants for pensions from the
I'nited States Government.
Dr. Crawford was born in Newark,
N. J., in 1842. After an elementary
education in the public schools he en
tered the College of Physicians and
Burgeons In New York City, and there
graduated in 1878. Previous to that he
had been an apothecary and was in
the. "United States service during the
Civil War in that capacity for two
years. He was connected with the
medical department in the Atlantic
the event all was not honestly conducted
In a deal in which he is associated with
McPherson. The tales of McPherson s
past life that have just come to light,
heretofore unknown to Mr. Thome, have
placed him on the anxious seat.
"As far as McPherson ever having been
mixed up in various transactions con
cocted with the intention of defrauding
the Government. I am totally ignorant,
said Mr. Thome last night. 'It is not
true that he has bunkoed me out of some
$3000. but it is true that 1 am at present
associated with him in a business matter
of a private nature, but as yet the matter
has not reached definite shape. I' has
been suggested that McPherson exercises
some sort of hypnotic Influence over those
whom he wishes to relieve of their wealth.
As far as this is concerned I know noth
ing. I never felt any strange sensations
while In his company, nor did he ever
manifest any feverish desire to acquire
mv wealth by other than legitimate
means. The deal in which we are now in
terested is a legitimate one. but just how
it will turn nut for me as yet I cannot
say."
Although denying that he had been bun
koed by McPherson: Mr. Thorn*-, when
asked if it were not true that he was so
involved in the transaction in question
that he would lose the amount named if
"Brick" chose to adopt his usual methods
of doing business, admitted that such was
the case. He also added that the stories
regarding the character of his associate
had caused his awak â  and in the fu
ture he would be a little cautious when
listening to the varnished tales of the
notorious manipulator. Mr. Thorne seems
to believe in the mythical Davis, for he
says that a short time ago McPherson in
troduced him to a "Mr. Davis" and he
thinks he ls the man ' crick now
charges with the diversion of tn. neat
sum of $100,000.
A few years â "-<< A. W. Fink, the prod
uce dealer, became involved it; a lit:;.- deal
with "Brick." the "importation" of silks
, with assurances of large fronts bell the
bait of the trap, in which he lost $15,000.
Mr. Fink is among the reticent people of
the city and is averse to discussing the
matter" refusing to either deny or atllrm
the rumor, hut in the practice of tne law
such a refusal is accepted as an afflrma-
McPherson barricaded himself behind
j the doors of his home. 324 Hayes street,
last evening- and refused to admit the
I strangers at the gate. In answer to an
inquiry he first said. "McPherson don't
; live here." Instantly he forgot that he
had thus spoken, admitted his identity.
' but said that as his wife was ill he would
| not open the door, as it might chill the
! residence. In the meantime the heaths
j tones of his wife's voice commanded from
! the top of the stairs that the door remain
j closed, and "Brick" obeyed, mounting the
stairs and just pausing long enough at the
top to toss out a little "work." Then he
! retired to dream of past deeds and
I scheme up deeds for the days to come.

Moreover, he has discovered that an at

throughout the State from the Eastern
head offices, This movement is not con
fined to th.- American companies. Sev

given up their big offices here, so that it
i- impossible for the Commissioner to se
cure a statement of tie- business done
each year throughout the State without

that the companies wish to evade a law

The German steamer Tai Fu is ashore at
Cape Zamok. a rocky headland on the
Siberian coast, and may be a total, loss.
She was here a couple of months ago, but
went to Portland, where she loaded 20.000
barrels of flour, valued at $58,000,, for
Vladivostok. She sailed from the Colum
bia River on June IS and must have gone
ashore several days ago, as the tel
egram to the Merchants' Exchange
telling of the disaster is dated July
19. Cape Zamok is about 96 miles from
Vladivostok, and Captain Schuldt must
nave sent a boat's crew to that place to
carry the news. The general impression
among shipping men is that the strong
northerly current must have, carried the
Tai Km out of her course and piled her up
on Cape Zamok or the small island lying
a short distance off shore. The Tai _ v is
owned by the. Asiatische Kustenfahrt Ges
of Hambur- and was built two sears ago
at Host., She is 224 feet 2 inches long,

and then the schooner will be headed for

a little over $4' m ' a skin. They have not

Prompt Action of Federal Authori

Precautionary Measures.
The Japanese steamship America Maru j
was released from quarantine yesterday
and her cabin passengers were landed last |
evening about 7 o'clock. The Chinese and
Japanese steerage passengers, seventy-six
in number, are still detained at Angel Isl
and, but will be brought over soon. The
vessel itself has been thoroughly fumi
gated and will be towed to the Pacific
Mail Steamship Company's dock early
this morning.
The passengers were happy at their
early release and were glad to get on
shore. The Federal quarantine officer,
Dr. Kinyoun, made a careful microscopic
examination of the blood of the Japanese
passenger who was taken ill on July 7. as
a precautionary measure. Satisfied that
it was simply a case of pneumonia, he
gave the directions by which the passen
gers were permitted to land.
Among those who boarded the vessel
early in the day were Assistant Surveyor
of the Port Chauncey St. John and six
customs inspectors. Detectives Ellis and
Gibson were at the dock when the Caro
line, which brought the passengers over,
landed, in hopes of catching the man who

TRIED TO END HER LIFE. I
Mrs. Wiemann, While Despondent,
Attempts to Commit Suicide.
Marie Wiemann, the wife of Henry
Wiemann, a laborer, living in the rear
of m:' Harrison street, attempted to end
her existence last evening by swallowing
a small quantity of laudanum. She was
found lying on the floor of the kitchen
of her home by her 12-year-old son, who
quickly summoned a neighbor. Realizing
that she had taken poison, he summoned
the ambulance and the woman was hur- :
riedly driven to the Receiving Hospital,
in the bosom of her dress was found the
following note, written in German:
"I cannot stand it any longer. Good-by -
my child. I will never see you again. Be
a good boy and never steal.
. â¢-YOUR MOTHER."
Young Wiemann accompanied his
mother to the hospital and attempted to |
explain that his parent had not tried to
commit suicide, but had taken the poi- :
son in mistake. He claimed that she is '
a sufferer from heart disease, but always |
appeared contented with her lot. Dr. i
Dray, who attended her, says she will
recover.

THE POLITICAL SITUATION.
THE Examiner of yesterday, in parade dress,
faces its ostentatious connection with low party
management, and in a column of large type pre
sents a euphemistic view of the Democratic situa
tion. If it ever had possessed any substantial reputa
tion for independence and for political decency, its
existing association with Rainey and the nominal an
tagonism between that political figurehead and the
resuscitated Chris Buckley would disabuse the pub
lic mind of any such fallacy. Whether Rainey or
Buckley wins in the primary election, the fusion
Democracy is in the hands of a polluted boss, and
Mayor Phelan, with his immeasurable pretensions,
contradicted by his practice, has perched himself in
the fusion saddle, with his author, his designer and
his finisher in front.
In national politics the fusion Democracy occupies
a position that excites the derision of the American
people. W. J. Bryan is still the pet of the fusion
masses and still feebly repeats the cry of free silver at
the ratio of 16 to i, but the other leaders of the mon
grel organization, with few exceptions, are deter-
mined to relegate him to private life. The quarrel as
it stands is at once discreditable and interesting, for
it exhibits the pettiest rivalries among fusionists who
aspire to be statesmen, while it almost concedes the
certainty of Republican success. The free silver ques
tion is dead, even in Japan and in India, and impe
rialism will be cared for within the Republican ranks
and cannot be used as a. dividing line between the
conflicting parti
But in the municipal contest, now so imminent, the
broad and long and large typed crows of the Ex
aminer are supremely absurd. Every visible indica
tion is in favor of a Republican triumph, which ought
to be assured, not merely from the logic of the situa
tion, but from common gratitude. The Republican
Legislature, instead of making "gross mistakes."
thoroughly vindicated Republican integrity. The
Board of Supervisors, as it turned out, had no "solid
seven" following the Democratic boodling prece
dents, but defeated every scheme that had been pro
jected and systematized to plunder the municipality,
held up the weak and shaking knees of Mayor Phelan
and removed the inequalities in assessments for which
the Democratic Assessor was responsible. There has
been no year in the history of California when mon
opoly, corruption and every form of treachery to. the
public interests have been so sternly and so effec
tively rebuked, and for this practical advancement
toward political reform the Republican party is clearly
entitled to the credit.
When the preparations already made for the muni
cipal campaign are considered, the prolonged brag
of the Examiner sounds like the bray of an ante
diluvian ass. The local Democratic organization is
in the hands of an oligarchy, controlled by bosses,
once repudiated and now held in an inextricable em
brace by the fusion organ. On the other hand, the
Republican corruptionists have been already beaten,
and a primary election has been arranged in which
thousands of the best men in San Francisco will par
ticipate. There is every reason to believe that the
Republican party will produce a municipal ticket not
a man of whom would voluntarily place his nostrils
where they would encounter the odor of the
Examiner-Rainey-Buckley combination, even with
the large-hatted Mayor Phelan skulking in the rear.
This is not. a Democratic but a Republican year.
The Call does not believe that the magnificent oppor
tunity that fusion corruption has offered will be
thrown away, and it does believe that the new char
ter will be safely inaugurated by a Republican admin
istration.
Forbearance is a virtue extensively practiced in the
office of the Examiner. For instance, in an article
telling of its efforts to overcoat Oregon Volunteers,
whether or no. its modesty was so excessive as to
prevent it mentioning its own name more than sixty
nine times. This is a remarkable record even for the
remarkable Examiner.
The present decade has witnessed the introduction
of horseless carriages, . smokeless powder, painless
bullets and senseless generals, but it remained for
the Examiner to spring costless charity.
SENATOR PLATT'S MANIFESTO.
AS The Call has repeatedly proved, up to this
date the administration in its relation to the
Philippine situation has required no defenders.
So long as military and naval operations against the
Filipinos are being conducted it is the duty ot the
Government, through its proper departments, and
under the control of the President, who virtute
officii is commander in chief, to furnish men and sup
plies and to exercise its usual functions for the sup
port of the army and of the navy. But these matters
of mine involve no extraordinary' proceedings and
are so completely within the range of stereotyped
officialism as, without any deficiency in average ca
pacity or in the knowledge of details, to invite no
criticism, nor even comment.
The administration has not invited nor required any
support in the Philippine campaign. But the pro
moters of imperialism, among whom Senator Piatt
of New York is to be signally included, have per
sisted in attributing to President McKinley and his
Cabinet a policy they have never announced, and in
volunteering a defense based upon imaginary propo
sitions. Again and again The Call has attracted pub
lic attention to the fact that, in no official or personal
declaration; has any representative of the adminis
tration even suggested the permanent retention of the
Philippines, either as national territory or as i de
pendency or colony. The entire argument' of the
gambling speculators, the thirsty aspirants for mili
tary glory and the intoxicated enthusiasts of the
country has rested upon a succession of assumptions,
of fallacies and of absurdities.
The manifesto of Senator Piatt, therefore, published
in our local columns yesterday, was purely volun
teered. President McKinley needed no vindication at
his hands, whether they be clean or unclean. There
has been no factious censure of the military opera
tions in the Philippines except from the hysterical
press, filled with the virus of fusion. There is no re
lation between the New York Senator and the Gov
enment that authorized him to pose as an attorney in
fact or an attorney at law. His "defense" is without
authority and merely presumptuous.
On the merits of the manifesto, apart from the as-
I sumptions that produced it, severe criticism is pos-
I sible. The central objection is that Senator Piatt de
signedly intermixes the military and political situa
tions, and undertakes to make a specious argument,
wholly disconnected from the Government itself, in
favor of Asiatic expansion. He designates the Fili
pinos as "rebels." If they are in this attitude toward
the United States what was the attitude of the makers
of this republic toward King George? He attempts
to cauterize the opponents of a revolutionary theory
'. which, inadvertently at least, he attributes to the ad
ministration, as lending aid and comfort to the 'Fili
pinos, and he unites in the unconstitutional attempt,
developed in other quarters, to prevent the clear and
honest expression of opinion by individuals and by
the press. He assumes that the nature and the fea
tures of this Government are unknown to the Fili
â¢ ' * i i i i 11 ii
pinos, and that they have been led to believe that the
political and the constitutional discussion of the Phil
ippine question in the United States would operate as
an obstruction to military and naval movements in
Asia.
It is marvelous that an American Senator should
thus vituperatively assail the constitution of his
country and the fundamental rights of every citizen it
contain"". It is equally astonishing that he should
have underestimated the intelligence and the educa
cation of the Filipino leaders, who, in man}* docu
ments, have shown that they comprehend the distinc
tion between military and political questions and the
theory and the detailed organization of our Govern
ment better than the learned and experienced Sena
tor from New York. There has been no document
published that more perfectly illustrates the necessity
for stern and uncompromising adherence to the prin
ciples and to the practice of our republican system.

THE STfITE PAIR.
UNLESS all signs are deceptive, the Stale Fair
will this year approach nearer the accomplish
ment of a comprehensive exhibit of all the in
dustries of California than has been attained in any
previous year, and consequently will be of more value
both to the visitors and to the exhibitors. The di
rectors are making earnest efforts to bring about such
a result, and the prospects are their work will be
crowned with success.
It is desirable that every county in the State should
have a good exhibit. The people of all the counties
are taxed to provide the appropriation for the fair,
and therefore all of them should take advantage of it
to make their resources and their industries known
throughout the commonwealth. Certainly they will
have only themselves to blame if they do not, for a
special appeal has been made to them to profit by the
exceptional advantages provided for such exhibits this
The opportunity ought not to be overlooked by the
manufacturers and the merchants of San Francisco.
The fair will be attended by thousands of visitors
from all parts of the State and from most of the
States and Territories of the coast. Whatever is ex
hibited at the fair in a striking and attractive way will
fix the attention of visitors and lead many of them
to give due consideration to its value. In that way
there will be gained for the products of the city a large
patronage now given to Eastern goods solely because
the articles of home manufacture are not generally
known.
The fair ought to be made this year something like
a dress rehearsal of the exhibit Californians are to
provide at Paris next year, and the directors have
given ample evidence of an intention to make it so.
The inducements they have offered to all counties and
all forms of industry are notably attractive. The pro
gressive counties will of course take full advantage
of them, and San Francisco should be among those
that do so. When the fair is open and the thousands
of visitors are thronging its halls and its grounds it
will be absurd if the exhibit of the metropolitan
county is eclipsed by that from any other in the com
monwealth or from any other part of the coast.
TrIE EASTERN VIEW OF IT.
ONE of the satisfactory features of the discus
sion concerning the condition and the pros
pects of the wine industry in California is the
amount of interest displayed in it by the East. The
issue is watched in that part of the Union with no
little attention, and has been extensively commented
on by many of the more influential papers in the
larger cities.
A short time ago we called attention to a review
of the subject by a correspondent of the New York
Times, who maintained that the depression is due
solely to the faults of those engaged in the wine in
dustry. As a proof of the correctness of his view the
writer stated that the wine industry in the East is in
a flourishing condition, and that while the output
amounts to hardly more than one-fifth of that of
California, it yields more money.
A somewhat similar view of the subject is taken by
THE SAN FRANCISCO CAI_I_, FRIDAY, JULY 21, 1899.
the Milwaukee Wisconsin. That journal maintains
that- more California wine would be consumed and
better profits would be made by the producers if the
dealers did not undertake to derive such a huge
profit. It says that while the producer in California
receives as low as io cents a gallon for his wine, the
consumer in 'the East is required to pay from 50
cents to $1 a bottle for it.
Summing up the issue the Wisconsin says: "Cali
fornia is now making wine that compares favorably
with many of the wines that are made abroad; in
deed, it is probably true that thousands of gallons of
California wine are annually consumed from bottles
and casks bearing foreign labels. All that is neces
sary to stimulate the wine business of the State is to
convince wine consumers that the domestic product
is as good if not better than many foreign wines.
The purchases of California wine would then increase;
and if the wine dealers would sell to consumers at' a
fair business profit the volume of their business would
be rapidly augmented." . .
While these Eastern comments may not be of any
assistance to California wine men "* in solving the
problems of the trade, they serve to advertise our
wine industry, and to show that Eastern sentiment is
favorably inclined to our wines. It is clear, therefore,
that our wine men have only to act with a fair degree
of business sagacity to obtain a good market there.
REGULATIONS FOR AUTOMOBILES.
A PETITION is now before the Supervisors
from a dairyman requesting permission to run
a milk-wagon with a gasoline motor. The
question of rules and regulations for the' coming
automobile fs therefore fairly before the authorities of
San Francisco, as it has been for some time before
those of the East.
A rule of the Park Commissioners of Chicago for
bidding the use of automobiles in the parks or along
the boulevards of that city was promptly declared in
valid by the courts, on the ground that the authorities
had no right under the law to discriminate against
such vehicles by name. It is the duty of the Commis
sioners, said the Judge, to enact and enforce regula
tions governing the use of any and all kinds of ve
hicles in the public pleasure-grounds, but they can
not forbid the use of an automobile any more than
they can forbid the use of bicycles or ordinary car
riages.
The issue is one which cannot be postponed. The
, Â . . . ...
automobile is coming into general use with much
greater rapidity than most people suppose. In every
large city the authorities arc considering how to ar
range rules for their use in such a way as to protect
the public from danger and at the same time safeguard
the rights of the progressive people who desire to
profit by the advantages of the new machine.
The New York Tribune, in discussing the problem
as it appears in that city, after pointing out that the
number of automobiles in use is steadily increasing,
and that they can now be seen everywhere on the
streets and in the parks, says: "Without attempting
to pass upon the merits of any particular plan, it may
be said unhesitatingly- that some special rules for the
regulation of the use of such vehicles would be en
tirely legitimate, and may well be necessary- To make
such rules would not be to discriminate against them,
but merely to recognize the fact that they are different
from horse vehicles and must be treated differently."
It is to be borne in mind, moreover, that not only
are automobiles different from other vehicles, but they
differ widely from one another. One type of the ma
chine might be safely permitted, while another would
be a cause of danger or a nuisance. What form of
motor car the petitioning dairyman wishes to run
through the streets as a milk-wagon we do not know.
It may be harmless, or it may be objectionable. It
has served the purpose of bringing to our authorities
the issue that is perplexing the East. The problem is
not one to be solved without much consideration, and
perhaps the safer plan will be not to adopt any gen
eral rule at all, but deal with each machine on its
merits until the East, with its greater experience, has
given us better ideas of how to deal with them all.
TRANSCONTINENTAL TELEPHONING.
REPORTS from Denver are to the effect that the
people of that city will soon have the advantage
of communication with New York by long
distance telephone. The authority for the report is
said to be E. B. Field, manager of the Colorado
Telephone Company, who has just returned from the
East, and who announces that after a full discussion
of the feasibility of the project a favorable decision
was reached and arrangements made for undertak
ing it.
The westward movement and extension of long
distance telephoning will not stop at Denver. In
fact, Mr. Field himself is quoted as saying the man
agers of the system have already cast their eyes upon
Salt Lake City and San Francisco. It is worth noting
that the Salt Lake Herald, in commenting upon the
Denver reports, says the news "is of deep local in
terest at this time, from the fact that telephonic com
munication between Salt Lake and Denver is among
the early. probabilities, and lines are being constructed
now that will eventually form a part of this system."
The long-distance telephone now reaches as far
west as Omaha. It is ho longer an experiment. It.
feasibility and its commercial value for communica
tion between widely separated points have been amply
proven. The extension of the system across the con
tinent is a mere matter of money and enterprise. The
managers are now considering the extension to Den
ver, and when once that has been accomplished a
further extension to San Francisco, will be a natural
and inevitable result.
The westward progress of the enterprise will be
watched on this coast with no little interest, and the
arrival of the new line will be hailed with welcome.
Modern ingenuity, profiting by the natural forces re
vealed by science, has worked many things that would
have appeared as miracles in -a former age, but noth
ing more wonderful has been accomplished than what
is now promised in a telephone communication across
the breadth of the continent.
Mr. Fillmore of the Southern Pacific complains
that he cannot get men to work in the country. Mr.
Herri- of the Southern Pacific had the trouble of
something the same kind, we believe, at Sacramento
last winter. This independence of the citizen is really
becoming most reprehensible. After a while, no

NEW MAGDALEN
AT THE ALCAZAR
THE New Magdalen"' is certainly the
most absurd mixture of pathos and
melodrama, of tragedy and uninten
tional humor that ever -rained and
rewarded the Interest of a theater
going public. Serious talk there was be
fore the rise of the curtain on Monday
night of withdrawing the play on Thurs
day and running "Camile" the rest of the
week. With standing room well occupied
and advance sales taking giant strides
and running leaps to Sunday, the inten
tion becomes a dead issue. Verily, wno
can feel the public pulse and prescribe
the necessary dose? There is but one line
in the play written for a- laugh, and yet
many of the serious speeches come up
against such opposite, situations that in
evitably they eventuate in merriment.
The mummers experienced a mild surprise
and the audience complacently feels that
it has rewarded a bid for a laugh to the
complete satisfaction of the bidder. . lis
the ne plus ultra of the unexpected.
Fancy a playwright giving a surgeon
a long, feverish melodramatic speech to
deliver while he performs a critical oper
ation upon the brain of a -woman nine
tenths along the road to Paradise apd j
making him when the bullet is extracted j
step to the foot of the couch and tell j
the audience and the "Master of all good I
workmen" how proud he is of the job.
The episode recalls little Jack Homer,
who "put in his thumb and pulled out a
plum and said 'What a good boy am I!' '
Mr. Webster- outdoes the intentions of
the author in demonstration and enthu
siasm, and we long to rush to the rescue
of poor helpless Grace Roseberry, with
a roll of antiseptic gauze and an hour of
quiet. Seldom is a worse part written |
than the one of Grace Roseberry.
How could such speeches ever find !
their way from the heart to the lips
of a woman of gentle birth? Miss Nan
nery plays the part according to her '
light about as well as it deserves to be i
played, but her light does not shine like i
"a good deed Ln a naughty world," and j
Grace gropes on melodramatically to her |
destiny. And yet in spite of absurdity j
we are interested to the end.
The part of Mercy Merrick has been
played by almost every emotional actress,
good and bad, since the days of Ada Caw
endish, who created the role years agcf
: in London, but never have we seen it done
in the quiet, earnest, thoughtful way of
Miss Roberts, who makes us feel it is
right. She does not whine through four |
nets in search of consolation and pity, j
i but, convinced that the common course of i
things is in favor of â âhappiness, she j
strikes for the one chance of redemption, |
straightens a bend where she can and In I
the end faces what seems the inevitable
with a single sob. The subdued tone of |
the early acts gives the one great speech \
in the fourth an added value, and Miss
Roberts gives a climax here such as only
the most intelligent sense of the true emo- >
tional could dictate. Julian Gray is a I
unique figure of a clergyman, a right good j
fellow, in fact. He is made to say in the
course of the dialogue: "I obtrude my
profession on no one." In sooth, how \
could he when his first entrance, in the '
solemn "cloth," rushes him headlong to '
thÂ© wine bottle, with "My aunt's claret is
worthy of my aunt. Vive la France," j
upon his lips. And, let me tell you, this is ;
mild when compared with the original, in
which Julian is given a half-page apos- ;
trophe to mirth, pleasure and the joys of
the town. A medieval swashbuckler ;
would not be given a jollier speech.
It serves, however, to put us en rapport
With the human side of his nature, and we
follow him with comfortable assurance
that he will guide without preaching, and j
love when he meets his fate with all the j
ardor of his lay brethren. Mr. Whittlesey I
gives an admirable performance of the i
role, meeting Miss Roberts' mood with j
one equally quiet and convincing. One of
the most conspicuous virtues of this actor â 
is that he never overacts. Miss Howe
does excellent work as Lady Janet Roy, I
"all the years" of whose life "have been
wasted in longing for something to love." j
The other roles are creditably sustained i
by the members of the Alcazar stock
company, and the play, with all its incon
gruities, has never a dull spot. Next
week we shall with regret bid farewell to
Mr. Morrison, who returns to play for the
last time his old beloved part of Faust.

gagement at the Columbia Theater will be

is certainly capable of winning favor fn
the greatest of the classics and his ap
pearance in "Hamlet" will be pleasantly
awaited.
Next week will be the farewell week of
Lewis Morrison at the Alcazar. Miss
Florence Roberts will remain several
weeks in a repertoire of several standard
emotional dramas.
"Romeo and Juliet," with Florence Rob
erts in the role of Juliet, will follow
"Faust" at the Alcazar.
"The Lady of Lyons" will be an early
date production at the Alcazar with Miss
Roberts in the leading role.
Never' before during the history of the
California Theater has that house done
such a business for its lessees as it is
now doing with the Frawley company on
the boards. From the Thursday night
that Miss Bates first opened in "The Last
Word" up to last night, when she ap
peared in "The Dancing Girl," not only
has every seat been sold, but hundreds
who have appeared at the box office have
been forced to turn away disappointed
simply because there was no place inside
to put them.
One of the greatest of the Tivoll's suc
cesses, the comic opera "Wang" has been
selected for production for next week to.
mark the close of the twentieth season
of the theater and the last appearances
at the house of the popular comedian. Ed
win Stevens. The- opera is well known in
this city, having been played at the Tiv
oli and also presented by De Wolf Hopper,
the original Wang. Although Mr. Ste
vens has a long list of "hits" in his stage
career none is greater than the one of the
Regent of Slam, which he â  plays next
week.
One* week from Monday the Tivoli will
begin a season of grand opera in En
glish, German and Italian, which will In
clude all the standard operas and many
which have never been rendered here.

famous lyric artists, notably. Fraulein
Ella Prosnitz, Mary Link. Signor Aveda
no, Baron Berthold. Signor Sallasa. Wil
liam Martens. Vlncen_b Fonerarl, William
Schuster and Inez Dean.
"Olivette" has been played to large
houses all the week. It will be followed
on Monday by "Faust," elaborately staged
and sung in English.
The Orpheum presents an unusually
good bill this week. George Wilson, Min
nie Palmer, the Rixfords and Hayes and
Litton are retained and new and clever
people fill the places of those who are
gone.
The vaudeville . performance .at the
Chutes is replete with bright things this
week and a good bill is announced to
follow, In the Zoo are to be seen the old
man kangaroo and other rare specimens
of the animal kingdom. *-

COMMUNICATIONS
IMPERIALISM.
By Daniel Gilbert.
It is refreshing in these days of blind
partisanlsm to find a journal of such wide
Influence and circulation as The Call ad
vocating the cause of truth and righteous
ness fearlessly. There is no doubt the
time is near at hand when your position,
so nobly taken, will be commended and
accepted by all loyal Americans regard
less of party name. I felt it my duty as
an Abraham Lincoln Republican to write
you this open letter and encourage if pos
sible your patriotic work.
Many utterances from pulpit and plat
form at this anniversary time of our na
tional independence must cause all can
did, liberty loving people to stop and re
flect as to their meaning. Is it possible
that we. have been celebrating in spirit
and in truth" our national birthday? If
our words accord with the Declaration
o*f Independence, then we have surely
been celebrating the day In the same
â¢spirit as intended by "the fathers.;* But,
strange to say, there are some who have
been "set apart to preach the gospel of
peace" who had no comforting words of
the Lord and Master to offer, but instead
breathing of. "the sword and slaughter."
To be more explicit; p. body of minis
ters met in San Francisco on July 3, 1599,
and proclaimed themselves in favor of
"bloody imperialism"â one of the number
going so far as to even applaud "our
noble Callfornian, James Jeffries": an
other member of the meeting said that
"the Lord Jesus Chrbst is behind the bay
onet." A prominent member of society,
not a church member, after reading the
account of the meeting, said to the
writer: "Can you wonder the churches
are growing lean and poor when such
enunciations come from clergymen?"
And then ho said: "I could never be In
duced to join a church with a pastor who
could preach such a damnable doctrine
as these men profess to believe. Christ
nowhere taught such a doctrine as that."
The speaker was correct, for Christ no
where taught such . a doctrine as pro
claimed by this Monday meeting of min
isters. There is a terrible responsibility
resting upon men who are supposed to
proclaim the gospel of Christ.
On Sunday, July 2, many pulpits took
up "Expansion and Imperialism," some
of them In strong terms favoring the
idea. One speaker is reported to have
said, "America is destined ere long to
rule the world; God speed the day," etc.
On the Fourth of July some orators up
held extreme views of imperialism even
to extended conquests in Asia, etc.
Can it be that we are living in the land
of Washington, Jefferson and Lincoln?
Can it be that we as a people. have for
gotten and desire to forever forget the
Declaration of Independence? (As one
imperialist said on the Fourth of July,
"it is a musty old document and should
be placed on the retired list.") Win it be
that we are ready to trample the Bible
under foot and try to blot out Christ and
his teachings? I do not believe it. I
believe that when the heat of an unholy
and unpatriotic impulse has spent itself
'"the great majority" will see the dangers
of such a course and reason and right will
assert sway. I cannot believe that the
masses have gone crazy and are ready to
fight for conquest and power. No! no! It
cannot be. This isâ this must be liberty
loving America, the land of the free and
the home of the brave, in that we desire
the happiness, freedom and well being of
other peoplesâ those who ask for and are
able to sustain a free government of their
own.
. To the churches comes the question of
serious importance: Do you expect to
carry the sword in one hand and the Bible
in the other and convert a people to
Christ? With homes burned, a land de
vastated, thousands of fathers and sons
slain, can that appeal to the living Fili
pino that we are a humane and Christian
people and that through us they can find
help and salvation worth having? Would
It not be cruel mockery in the ears of a
people to listen to missionaries from such
a nation? "Stop and think on these
things."

IS CORONER HILL
SUPERIOR
TO THE LAW?
-vORONER HILL and the laws made
I for his guidance do not seem to
I hitch. He has his own free and
\^ easy ideas concerning the conduct
>of affairs at the Morgue.
Strange as it may appear, the statutes
in such case made and provided do not
seem to conform to these ideas.
So much the worse for the statutes!
When that mountain of fleshâ Hill, rath
erâplants his brogans on a poor statute,
God help it! It's all day with it."
It becomes a dead letter,. indeed, and,
as such, a fit subject for the Coroner!
Time and again within a very short pe
riod has Coroner Hill shown a reckless
disregard for the . laws enacted for the
government of his office. This was be
lieved at first by those that knew him to
be due to native ignorance or carelessness
at the worst. His acquaintances have
had another guess, and they guess that
he hadâ well, reasons.
His most recent actions cannot be ex
plained else. -;'- â ;â . .-.:'â¢'â¢ . _Â
Take, for instance, the case of Florence
Parker. She. was found dead in her bed
Saturday morning last. One of Hill's
deputies, Gately, was informed by Dr.
-Levison, the Parker family physician,
that the girl had committed suicide.
The law provides what shall be done
in such a case. It reads: -'Whenever any
â¢ Coroner shall receive notice that any per
son has been slain, or has committed sui
cide, or has died suddenly, or has been
found dead under such circumstances as
to require an inquisition, it shall be his
duty to go to the place where such per
son shall be â¦ * * and shall forthwith
summon Â» * * jurors to appear beforo
him forthwith and make inquisition con
cerning such death."
Of course, for his own purposes, Coro
ner Hill contends that Florence Parker
did not commit suicide: but he certainly
will not contradict the statement that she
died suddenly. Taken for granted the
testimony of all parties concerned that
she died suddenly and not insisting that
she committed suicide, what was Coroner
Hill's duty under the circumstances?
The law provided it. It said he must
go to the place of death, summon jurors
and begin an inquisition into all the cir
cumstances attending such death.
Did Coroner Hill obey this law in the
case of Florence Parker, who, whether
she committed suicide or died, suddenly.
was a subject for inquisition?
Not much. He disregarded the law in
letter and in spirit. He went to the place,
but he summoned no jurors and he began
no inquisition. * . ...
Ho did one thing, however, and. like
several other things he has done, was
absolutely illegal. He called in a physi
cian and caused him to perform an au
topsy
In this Coroner Hill violated the law
made for him and every other coroner.
The law governing autopsies specially
provides that "the Coroner shall appoint
a competent physician, whose duty it shall
be to perform autopsies upon the bodies
of all deceased persons WHEN IN
QUESTS ARE HELD."
Will Coroner Hill have the temerity to
say he held an inquest on the body of
Florence Parker? Who can tell!
He went to the house in person, it is
true, but he did not summon any jurors
to view the body or hear testimony con
cerning the circumstances attending the
girl's death. There is no record at the
Morgue, as required by law when one is
held that there was an inquest. Under
what right, then, did ho order an au
topsy? Why?
Read Coroner Hill's report to the Super
visors:
I have adopted a plan of holding inquests at
J the homes of deceased persons and find that
| It gives a great deal of satisfaction to bereaved
I relatives and. friends.
That autopsy, God save the mark, was
Intended to prove nothing and allowed to
prove nothing that did not give "a great
deal of satisfaction." to the bereaved rela
tives and friend- of Florence Parker.
It was not allowed to proceed far
enough to determine beyond question, as
the law contemplates, the cause of death:
But what is the law to Coroner Hill!
All Greek, apparently, or some other de
ceased letter, to be thrown on a slab at
the Morgue and autopsied to determine
what ailed it.
But the day of retribution is coming.
In the great morgue of public opinion a
jury of the public will sit on the political
corpse of Coroner Hill to return a verdict
of suicide at the polls. He will be borne
ii(. Salt River to tho dumps and planted.
A double cross will mark the spot. On
it will be the legend, "Here Lies a Stiff."

TO BUY CIGARETTES
â¦TWO SMALL BOYS WHO STARTED EARLY IN CRIME.
c? AWRENCE FORRESTER and James McDermott are cigarette
1 "fiends" and petty larceny thieves. Lawrence- is 9 years of age and
lives with his parents on Stanley street, and James McDermott is two
/tf sj ears older and lives on Harriet street. They work together, and
eighteen months ago were arrested for stealing hats from a freight
car on Townsend street. Owing to their youth, they were sent home. About
three months ago they were arrested for stealing brass from Southern Pa
cific cars and Judge Graham gave them another chance.
Yesterday afternoon they visited the depot <*t Third and Townsend streets
and turned their attention to a Salvation Army poorbox. McDermott had
a knife and forced open the lid of the box, taking $1 03 from it.- A woman
who is employed in a restaurant at the depot observed them and compelled
McDermott â¢>> return the money to the box. He returned 93 cents, being
shrewd enough to deftly place two nickels in his mouth. The boys broke
away from the woman, who sounded an alarm, and Special Officer Robin
son and Policeman O'Connor gave chase. They captured Lawrence, but Mc-
Dermott escaped. Lawrence was taken to the City Prison and charged with
petty larceny. O'Connor later swore to a complaint for McDermott's ar
rest in Judge Treadwell's court.
Lawrence when seen In the prison acknowledged his share of the theft!
He said he and McDermol went to the depot to look around and when
they saw the â . box they could not resist the temptation of robbing it.
They wanted money to buy cigarettes, and the first request he marie was for
one, as he said he was lying for a smoke. He saw McDermott put the two
nickels in his mouth and when he asked him for one he would not give up,
which made him angry, He does not seem to realize that he has done wrong
in stealing. â¢

VERY FEW AVAIL THEMSELVES
OF THE PRIVILEGE.

The Examiner's Hundreds of Over
coats Have Dwindled Down to
Eight. Which Arrived Yes
terday Morning.
The Oregon regiment will parade this
afternoonâ the first dress parade sine--*
it returned to this country. The regiment
will form on the Infantry parade ground
at the Presidio at i o'clock. it will make
a fine showing, for the Oregon troop
were well known for their drill and dis
cipline while at Manila, and they have
forgotten none of what they learned. The
regiment will be reviewed by General
Summer's and probably by Colonel Free
man, commandant at the post.
The Issue of extra clothing was obtain
ed yesterday, but it di.i not go far, for
there was some hitch in the overcoat gup
ply. The Examiner's promised invoice of
hundreds of overcoats fell down to eigat.
Just eight overcoats were .received, and
these were issued. It has always been
that way with Examiner promises. As
for : blanket;*, the regiment had enough
to supply all who asked for them. And
those who asked for extra clothing were
not numerous. Two companies declined
to call for anythingâ neither blankets nor
overcoats. Od-j company called for'olan
kets, but no overcoats, and two mora
called tor one overcoat apiece. The mem
orandum held by the regimental Quarter
insÂ»Mer, Lieutenant Knapp, is as follows:
Company A, no blankets and no over
coats; Company 13, seven blankets, one
overcoat; Company C, thirteen blankets,
no overcoats; Company D, live blankets
and five overcoats; Company E, no blan
kets and no overcoats; Company )â ", thir
teen blankets, twenty-four overcoats;
(ompany G. twenty-one blankets, seven
overcoats; Company 11, thirty blankets,
two overcoats; Company 1, no blankets
and no overcoats; Company K. nineteen
blankets, twenty overcoats;' Company L,
lifteen blankets, no overcoats; Company
M,- fifteen blankets, two overcoats.
The Red Cross Society gave thirty over
coats. These have all been issued, Eight
more arrived yesterday morning. These,
too. were issued. General Warfield will
probably come to the relief of the Ex
aminer with a few more to-day, and these
will lie issued until the requisitions re
ferred to shall have been filled out.
There are over 1200 men In the regiment,
all shivering with cold, according to tha
Examiner, but out of thai number all
tlie overcoats applied for amount to a
total of seventy-one, and all the blankets
to 138. It was a great victory tor tne
Examiner and its advertising bureau.

IDAHO MINING TROUBLES.
I An Imported Miner Writes That They j

I Wallace, a returned soldier at Manila I
! who received an honorable discharge and j
! Went to the Cdeur d' Alette country, where {
i the recent miners' troubles have at- .
tracted considerable attention. Wallace i
I secured work in the mines and says that '
I the conditions in that country are not as j
j they have been represented to i.e.
"There are still upward of 300 men in j
i the 'bull pen,'" writes Wallace, "and as ,
jwo passed along the road toward the J
; mines, the wives of the men whom we
replaced taunted us with being 'scabs,' \
: and after we got settled in our little :
cabin, a little girl came in and said we j
had come to take her papa's place. You !

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JULY 21, 1899.
MORE OF THE SAN JOSE
BANK BLUNDERS FOUND
MRS. WRIGHT'S POOR CHANCE
TO RECOVER MONEY.
Directors' Deed for Security Is Null
and Voidâ Others Who Made
Loans Are in the Same Fix.
According to an opinion by Assistant
Attorney General Sturtevant Mrs. Myra
! B. Wright of. San Jose is liable to have
trouble in recovering (60,000 loaned by her
to the Union Savings Bank of San Jose.
The opinion was in response to an in
] quiry by the State Bank Commissioners.
I In IS9B and the. early part of this year
; W. H. Wright was one of the directors
! of the bank, which is now in liquidation.
! His wife advanced the $*iO.OOO to the bank
j and to secure the payment of the loan the
: bank directors gave the lady a deed on
| the bank property. At the same time Mrs.
I Wrlgnt executed a contract agreeing to
I reconvey the property to the Institution
' upon the repayment of the $60,000.
Mr. Sturtevant in bis opinion states
that the Union Savings Bank of San Jose
'< was originally a savings bank and had
| been conducting a savings bank business.
| The statutes under which it was incor
porated and operating clearly show that
â  It is beyond the power of the corporation
! to do a' commercial banking business and
: its directors had no right to borrow the
money from Mrs. Wright, and that the
j contract under which it borrowed the
, money from her and issued the deed to
the bank .premises, as well as the lady's
i contract to reconvey the property upon
! repayment of the money, were all null
; and void. Mr. Sturtevant advises the
! Bank Commissioners to inform the offi-
c ials now in charge of the bank that the
Wright contracts are worthless.
It seems that at different times during
' the past two years the board of directors
iof this bank have borrowed sums of
, monov from different persons for which
I they gave as pledges the securities of the
| batik. Mr, Sturtevant writes that the
same rules apply to these cases as to that
of the transactions between the directors
I and Mrs. Wright.
MR. SPEAR'S PERIL.
How He Bravely Captured a Young
Melanolestes Picipes in the
Custom House.
Customs Surveyor Spear is thankful
hat he escaped being inoculated with the
juice of the kissing hug. and he has the
bug on exhibition in a small whisky flask.
ill- encounter happened yesterday. Time,
forenoon; place, the Surveyor's desk in
'he Custom-house.
The Surveyor was conversing with a
broker, when something landed on his
mustache near the corner of his nose on
the port side. Before the something,
which was the -tig, could gel his diamond
drill and vacuum pump into operation
Mr. Spear dashed his bugship senseless
upon the desk and captured him, using a
wad of newspaper as a guard for his
fingers. The unwelcome visitor was then
placed in a bottle, where he came to his
senses after a while and astonished the
brokers with an exhibition of agility.
The bug has six legs and two feelers.
The legs are spidery and covered with
Miff bristles like those of the tarantula
and the ends of the feelers are curled in
wardly like the tendrils of a vine. The
eyes of the bug are jet black and shiny
and bulge out as prominently as shoe
buttons. The muzzle is sharp and the
head, viewed through a magnifying glass,
resembles that of a horse. There are two
slender, gauzy wings standing out at
right angles from the body when the In
sect is traveling.
It was pronounced to be a young speci
men of the melanolestes picipes, or as
sassin bug.
LUCK OF A CONFIDENTIAL CLERK,
Gained Wealth on a Small Invest
ment.
J. J. Seneca l, confidential clerk of Ar
mani! Cailleau, 114-116 Kearny street,
San Francisco, invested $1 in the June '
22 drawing of the Lottery Beneflcencia
Publica of the City of Mexico, pur
chasing one-fourth of the ticket 70,859
which won $60,000, his share being
$15.000, which amount was promptly
paid to him.
The lottery of the P.enificencia Pub
li.ii of the City of Mexico is very
popular on this coast because many of
the. capital prizes have been won here
and payments made promptly.
The lottery of the Reneficencia Pub
lica of the City of Mexico is the only
one that is guaranteed and protected
by the Mexican National Government,
and all drawings are held in public
under the immediate supervision of
Federal officers. !.*, .
The Mexican National Government
appointed Hon. Antonio Perez to act
for the Treasury Department and
Senator Apolinar Castillo acts as In
tervener, therefore every one is as
sured of the honest dealings of the old
reliable lottery of the Beneflcencia
Publica of the City of Mexico, which is
under the able management of U. Bas
setti.

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, July To-day's stock market
continued narrow and professional, but there
was an improvement in the tone of speculation.
In the iate market a rather active buying j
movement set in and prices rose to the top â¢
level of the- day. gaining a point or over as ;
compared with last night's price in many cases.
There was an early reaction, which was en
couraged by the violent slump of 22 points in !
New York Air BraJ<e and an extreme decline of j
5 points in Consult*, ited Gas. There seen to |
be an entire absence of commission house buy- i
ing. and London, although prices of American j
had been advanced there, trained from oper
ating here. The course of the foreign ex
change market with reference to easier money |
conditions abroad was closely watched, and {
when sight sterling and cables were seen to be I
yielding it afforded considerable relief from :
apprehension of gold exports. The fact that ]
the Bank of England refrained from advancing
Its rate -of discount, was taken a? evidence that !
the threatened money stringency Is about over I
there. Money worked easier in New York, but
continued above the rates prevailing at interior
points. There was some growth of a convic
-tion that money was not to become cheap for
a considerable period yet owing to the needs I
of the very active trade and the coming move- '
ments of the crops. The heavy Increases 'â¢:'
banking deposits at some of the large financial j
centers of the country are now understood to
be due to the great combinations of industries
and the resulting readjustments In business
methods which have, it is believed, reduced I
resources at some smaller points in a decree j
corresponding to the Increase at the great cen- |
ters. There was some continued uneasiness j
also over evidences of unrest among wage earn- |
ers. The strength of the local traction stocks j
helped to dissipate this* selling. Brooklyn
Rapid Transit and Manhattan gained about a
point net nd cash sales of Metropolitan were i
made at 3"* over last night. This stock also 1
sold ex-rights of subscription to new stock at
a uniform level of 13 points below the cash
sales Consolidated las recovered all of it?
earlier loss and New York Air Brake all but 2
points. The early strength was not held in j
some of the. Industrials, notably Continental
Tobacco and the steel stocks. Pittsburg C |
('. & St. Louis was marked up 5 points on the |
June return of earnings and an upward move- I
ment in Chesapeake and Ohio, Missouri Pacific '
and Cleveland, C. C. & St. Louis, spread to
other railroad stocks, including the grangers,
westerns, New York Central, Union Pa
cific and Atchison preferred. The average I
gains of these approximated a point. Chicago
Great Western debentures lost 1% from the last
sale. Leather preferred was in good demand.
The closing was dull but firm.

slipped off to 70% c. The decline was checked
by reports of damage to the spring crop by a
hot wave in the Dakotas, closely followed by
heavy rains. The bears tried to get back
former holdings, and as competition was keen
September rose quickly to 71%e. Realizing dur
ing the last hour, however, caused a decline
to 71c at the close. An estimate by Beerbi
of this year's yield in Roumanla of only 25,000,
--' 000 bushels, compared with 56,000,000 bushels
last year, helped to sustain the market.
Corn was moderately active but somewhat
depressed by continued liquidation, induced
largely by fine weather and an excellent crop
report. September closed a shade higher.
An early drive by scalpers caused a slump
In Oats, but the loss was fully regained on

The official letter from the Justice mine for
the week ending July 18 says: On the 370-foot
level, west crosscut No. 1 from the station
was advanced 15 feet since last report, making
its total distance 237 feet, passing through
porphyry with streaks of quartz; some of which
gave low assays. During the week we put In
a blower and air pipe, which greatly facilitated
work in the face. The winze in the south drift,
opposite the north drift, is down 16 feet. The
bottom continues in low grade quartz.
The official report from the Belcher mine for
the pa,st week states that on the 1000-foot level
an east drift from the station was commenced
and is now in 8 feet. The face is in porphyry.
On the 1000-foot level the east crosscut from the
main north lateral drift Is- now. out 199 feet,
having been advanced 6 feet during the past
week. The face shows porphyry. On the 1100
--foot level general repairs to the Belcher. Crown
Point and Yellow Jacket Joint north lateral
drift are still being continued. On the 1200-foot
level the raise from east crosscut No. 1 is up
52. feet, 10 feet having been made during the
week. This raise Is now connected with the
i winze from the 1100-foot level, and by this con
nection a good circulation of air has been ob
tamed. There have been hoisted during the
week and stored in the ore house at the mine 20
mining carloads of ore, the average top car
sample of which shows an assay value of $12 45
per ton. â¢

CORONER THREATENS
TO JAIL BALDWIN
Dr. Mehrmann Says a Felony Mas
Been Compounded,
Undertaker McCarthy May Bring Suit fcr Twenty
Thousand Dollars for Breach of That
Secret Morgue Contract,
is a certain little man in this town who, if he takes
THERE is a certain little man in this town who. if he takes
a. my advice, will keep his mouth shut, or else he will soon find
himself under arrest for compounding a felony. â [Statement of
Coroner Mehrmann this afternoon.]
There is no doubt as to who the "little man" is, for in the
Coroner's celebrated 10.000 word speech before the Supervisors
he is*"- the following language: ''While Coroner this little man
drew down all that, there was legitimate in the office, and, following
the new rule recently prescribed by Expert Bullock, it has even
been hinted by the late Coronei 's enemies that in his rapacity and
greed for gain he attempted to exact from an employe a division of
the latter's earnings, but of course such an insinuation would be
scorned by the doctor's friends."
The â¢*latÂ£* Coroner" was Dr. B. 0. Baldwin.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, July 20.
And Dr. Baldwin calmly refuses to say
a single word. Up to date Dr. Baldwin ;
certainly carries the belt for discretionâ
if silence be discreetâ for he has stead
fastly refused to open his mouth except j
to ask his interviewers what brand of
cigars they would like to sample.
The year ISSiI will go down in the poli- |
tical history of Alameda County as the I
year of gold bricks. This traffic has by j
r.o means been confined to the City Hall,
for the county political family has been j
doing a land office business in the gilded
article among its own members.
It is now very plain that Mr. Tobln?
when he resigned as steward of the Re
ceiving Hospital to become Deputy . ;oro- j
ncr, was cherishing a gold brick. James
McCarthy; the undertaker, certainly got j
one of the articles, and if Dr. Mehrmann |
be sincere in his desire for <>. public j
Morgue Albert Brown has probably got I
the most carefully . gilded brick in the!
whole fabrication.
Supervisor Roeth was not to be caught j
ln this little deal over the county's dead.
Dr. Mehrmann says that Mr. Roeth was
the Supervisor who was approached by ;
Messrs. Clark and Blair to take up their j
.end of the deal when McCarthy drew out. !
Roeth was far too shrewd to get mixed
up in any such proposition and washed his j
hands of the whole affair, and he is now I
congratulating himself that he did.
The most interesting point is the im- '
plied criminality behind Dr. Mehrmann's I
threats that if the "little man" in the j
mix-up does not behave himself he will
possibly have to answer a charge of j
felony. The Coroner will say no more and
Dr. Baldwin will not say as much, and
it is believed that this is the thirteen-Inch
gun which Dr. "Mehrmann declares he- has j
loaded and which he will fire when the j
proper opportunity presents itself;
It is not at all unlikely that the matter
will be taken before the Grand Jury, but j
although the old scandal is disgraceful
and reilects discredit on nearly every
body concerned In it, there has not so far i
been anything developed which can be!
called criminal. The locating of the I
Morgue and the natural profit resulting
therefrom are all legitimate from a noli- !
tical standpoint and are made possible by j
the failure of Alameda County to own its
own Morgue. When the contract was
made the Coroner presumably did not
guarantee to the undertakers that there
would be anything received from the con
duct of the Morgue in the way of fees
that was not. properly earned an.l legally;
payable by the county. This being the
case; the Coroner is at perfect liberty to
make any deal he likes for the distribu
. s he j
WOMAN WITH THE AX

OAKLAND. July 20.-Irvine Britton, the
housecleaner, who was assaulted by his
wife with an ax last Saturday night, ap
plied to the police to-day for a search
warrant to obtain possession of his clothes
from his residence on Linden street. He
declares that his wife would not let him

DEATH OF WILLIAM CRAIB.
OAKLAND. July 20.â William Craib,
who died at San Diego this morning, left
this city si_ weeks ago with a party of
prospectors for the newly discovered
placer mines ... Pintnda, Lower Califor
nia. The party met with disappointment,
end returning stopped it San Diego,
wnere Mr. Craib became afflicted with
asthma. His death Is attributed to heart
failure produced by exposure and bard
ships of the trip. '
Deceased was a pioneer and one of the
best known mining men on the Pacific
coast. He was a native of Sorel, province
of Quebec, Lower Canada, aged 65 years.
He leaves a widow and three daughters,
Mrs. Lottie tib-Parsoi of this city.
Miss Lovell Craib, who is leading lady
with Davis & Kenough's dramatic com
pany, and Miss . trace < 'rail), a writer,
now" engaged on a New York paper.
Deceased was identified with tl.-<- Mason
ic and Odd Fellows orders in this city.
Suit Over Estate of Insane.
OAKLAND, July 20.â 8. C. Hawes, as
administrator of the estate of Anna Schu
macher, an incompetent, who died at the
County Infirmary last March, to-day filed
suit against Frank G. Andrews, as exe
cutor of the .state of Thomas A. Smith,
deceased, who was guardian of Mrs.
Schumacher's estate and person, for an
account of the administration had by
Smith upon the estate of Mrs. Schu
macher. Public Administrator Hawes also
asks that the account be settled and that
defendant be required to pay to plaintiff
till moneys belonging to the Schumacher
estate.
Policemen Under Investigation.
OAKLAND. July 20.â Chief of Police
Hodgkins is investigating the conduct of
Officers William McCloud and Peter Gar
rity regarding the encounter between the
two officers at Seventh and Market streets
yesterday. As yet the Chief has not de
cided whether or not charges shall be
brought against the two men before me
Police Commissioners at the meeting next
Wednesday. Both men, however, are sus
; <nded pending the investigation.
Hardy-Lathrop Nuptials.
OAKLAND, July 20.â Miss Marie Louise
Lathrop and Tracy Sherman Hardy were
married at noon to-day at the home of
the ride's father. S. Lathrop, 1206 Frank
lin street, Rev. Charles R. Brown of the
First Congregational Church officiating.
Miss Florence White was the bridesmaid
and Charles G. Hardy, brother of the
groom, acted as best man. On returning
from their honeymoon the young couple
will make their home on Prospect avenue.
Reliance Wins Championship.
OAKLAND, July 20â Although the Re
liance club was one game ahead the hand
ball games at Its quarters last night be
tween th. Reliance team and that of the
Olympics to settle the amateur champion
tÃhip of the coast resulted In another vic
tory, the Reliance scoring 51 against the
Olympics 12. The tournament commenced
â  i
says is all that was done and he cares not
for the petty quarrels and incriminating
statements being made up by rival under
takers.
Dr. Mehrmann throughout admits that
sume of his charges are in excess of what !
the law allows him. but he always justi
fies his claim by stating that he "took the
bills of the last Coroner for his guide and
as they were allowed him (Dr. Baldwin) '
he sees no reason why the same Board of
Supervisors should not allow them to the
present Coroner.
In his statement to the Supervisors Dr. |
Mehrmann refers to an alleged attempt
of his predecessor. Dr. twin, to ex
act a portion of the legitimate salary of
an employe for his own personal gain.
The only two employes of the Cor.-." are
his deputy and the stenographer. The
deputy is Henry Quellin, who is still
deputy under Mehrmann, and policy
forces him to keep quiet; the stenog- t
rapher. Eugene Van Court, being em
ployed as official stenographer of the \
Police Court, is far too wise to take any
hand in the row and consequently Dr. .
nann's hint may probably never be
explained; unless he sees h*t totdo it him- !
self.
The whole of the unpleasantness Is due
not to any overcharges that the Coroner
may have made, but to politics. Dr. Mehr
mann. new to the business, would proh- :
i ably have been better off had he not fired 1
I that ten-thousand word excoriation at the '.
J Supervisors. He is no match in the game
! of politics for those wise old politicians
hat have manipulated the county govern--';
ment for a generation. The man against
whom Mehrmann directed most of his j
thunder was Supervisor Will Church, and j
when asked to-day for some idea regard- i
ing the situation Church simply replied! â¢
"I am not in politics. you can quote that
as my sentiment."
"When th( smoke clears away," said j
Colonel Bullock, the county expert, whose
action in cutting down the claims cf the I
Coroner proved the nucleus around which j
the Morgue sensation was finally ex
ploded. "1 will be on top. Coroner Mehr
mann shall never hear a word of sarcasm
from me. Because I performed my duty
in pointing but overcharges In his claims
he has hurled a page and a half of vitu
peration at me through his answer to the
Supervisors. Of course 1 snail have a re
ply to make, but this will be wholly based
on facts. I have saved this county nearly
$7.> X* since my appointment as county ex- I
pert last Octoberâ all representing over- '
charges in bills put in by claimants !
.-'gainst this county.
"1 can 'now see that the animus under- j
lying Mehrmann's attack on me is solely!
the fact that the Supervisors recently
passed solutions curtailing th. emolu
ments of the Coroner by allowing him
the charges of $5 for the removal of dead |
bodies and $2 for interments only in cases i
of indigents." j
ral months ago, but the final game
several months ago. but the final game
had been postponed from time to time for
various reasons. Last night'S victory re
: moves all doubts as to the championship.
Joined the JFruit Trust.
OAKLAND, July 20. -Another fruit
preserving company lias been absorbed
by the California Fruit Canners' Asso
!'elation. A deed was placed on record to
! day whereby tlie Oakland Preserving
j Company conveys to he association its
! plant at the foot of Myrtle street and all
| its property in this city, the revenue
, stamps indicating th. consideration to be
i about $51,000. Only a few days ago the
i King-Morse Canning Company of San
i Leandro transferred Its property to the
i association.
Nosebleed Caused Death.
OAKLAND, July 20. â The death of
Frank Medina, aged 7 years, which oc
curred at the home of his parents on
Fruitvale avenue Last Tuesday night, was
the result of his nose bleeding severely
for several days. The usual household
remedies giving no relief, physicians were
called, but by the time the bleeding
ceased the child was so weak that death
followed shortly.
Consolidation Now Confirmed.
OAKLAND, July 20.â The stockholders
of the Contra Costa Water Company held
a special meeting to-day a**'! straightened
out certain Informalities that had been
discovered in the consolidation of that
company with the Oakland Water Com
pany, confirmed the details of the consoli
dation and guaranteed the $1,500,000 issued
by the company. The meeting was well
attended, 2.8,350 shares out of the 30,000
shares being represented. Later this after
noon a certificate increasing the bonded
Indebtedness of the company $1,500,000 was
filed with County Clerk Jordan.
SUIT AGAINST SCALPERS,
It appears that the various "ticket
scalpers" throughout the State have been
reaping a harvest during the Educational
Association Convention at Los Angeles
and yesterday suit was filed to enjoin
further dealing on their part. In the
action the Southern Pacific Company ap
pears as plaintiff and A. OtHnger, S. N.
Newman, W. H. Harrison, C. a. Buckley.
Michael Welsh; Charles Conklin and a
number of fictitious persons appear as
defendants. In th.- complaint It Is set
forth that the scalpers have been induc

BEADS ON THE STAGE
Nance O'Neill Retributes Her London
Success to Father ballu's Qift.
OAKLAND July Rev. Father John Lally of Haywards has re
\ ceived an invitation from Nance O'Neill to be present at her appear
! ance at a London theater upon the occasion of her presentation of
"The Jewess." _,â_,-
Behind this invitation is a pretty little story which commenced man*.
vÂ«r_-__o when the celebrated actress, then a little girl, was a friend of
Father lallv After going on the stage the friendship was preserved, and
when Miss O'Neill appeared at the Haywards Opera-house some months ago
Father Lally was one of the first to congratulate her on her su c< ss In pre
senting "The Jewess," a set of beads figures conspicuously. Miss i ' Neil used
ar-ronertv set for the occasion, and this becoming known to her reverend
friend he presented her with a fine mother-of-pearl set of rosary beads
on the occasion of her giving a benefit at Haywards for the parish. Miss
O'Neill is like her father, a Protestant, hut she highly prizes the beads and
regards them somewhat in the nature of a charm. No matter in what play
she is "taking part she always takes the beads on the â¢â '*-*â â¢ with her. and al
though not superstitious, she attributes to this little gift all the powers of
a 'whea'she made her appearance before the British critics in London she
used Father Lady's gift, and has written to her reverend friend saying that
when she returns to America she will spend one night at Haywards for the
benefit of her old friend.
BRIDE WAS OR
FIRE WITHIN
HER BOUDOIR
Miss Hobart Delayed
the Ceremony.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
908 Broadway, Jul- 20.
Little did the guests gathered at th. Ho
bart residence last night know that while
they were being kept waiting for the ap
pearance of the bride she was struggling
with flames in her boudoir.
Miss Susan Caroline Hobart was mar
ried last night at her parents' residency
to Samuel Porter Lovett, a well-known
newspaper man of San Francisco.. While
preparing to enter the drawing room
where the guests and minister were watt
ing, some of the bride's Huffy garments
caught fire from a candelabrum in the
room. In an Instant her bridal veil was
on fire, and as a bridal costume is gener
ally of a very Inflammable nature, there
was much consternation on the part of
her maid for a few moments. The bride,
however, retained her self-composure, and
with remarkable presence of mind sub
dued th.- flames by sacrificing part of her
veil The puff above the coiffure had
burned before it could be extinguished,
but Miss Hobart quickly improvised a new
puff with as much calmness as though she
were going for a walk instead of going be
fore the altar to be wedded.
It required about fifteen minutes to re
pair the damage done and restore the
bridal veil, after which Miss Hobart. even
without a bridesmaid, walked into the
hall, where she was met by her father
and was escorted under the bridal bower.
There was nothing in her manner to in
dicate that she had just passed through a
very exciting experience, and not until the
ceremony was over did the guests know
the cause of the delay.
Rev. E. S. Chapman, D.D., performed
the ceremony at the Hobart residence, 1168
East Nineteenth street. There were no
bridesmaids and Miss Bessie Hobart, the
bride's sister, played the wedding march
and sang a few favorite ballads. Mr. I.ov
en has Tong been employed In newspaper
work in San Francisco, and his bride is a
well-known elocutionist. Mr. and Mrs.
Lovett have gone to Southern California,
and on their return will reside in East
Oakland.
DIED AT THE BUSS HOUSE.
Benjamin S. Litle, a Wealthy Capi
talist From Eureka, Passes
Away.
Benjamin S. Litle, a wealthy capitalist
of Eureka, Humboldt. County, died early
yesterday morning at the Russ House in
this city. Litle had just returned from a
trip in 'the East, when he was taken ill
with a stomach complaint which resulted
in his death. He is reputed to have been
worth about $200,000, and was well known
in San Francisco, where he had many bus-
mess interests. : . . _**;â ',
On July 14 Litle registered at the hotel.
He was troubled with a stomach com
plaint, and fruit which he had eaten after
arriving In this city brought on a severe
attack. A physician was called, but noth
ing serious was apprehended until
Wednesday morning, when his condition
became alarmingly worse. Dr. Sydney
Rogers was sent for, but could give the
sufferer little aid from the fact that he
was well along in years and had but little
vitality. A nurse was secured and the
doctor remained in almost constant at
tendance until the hour ..of Litle's death,
which occurred at 4 o'clock yesterday
morning. , , ,
Litle was known as a money lender, and
held many mortgages on property in the
northern part of the State. His brother,
who was a well-known horseman, died
about a year ago, leaving Benjamin an
estate amounting to over $100,000. It was
this estate which the deceased was set
tling up when he made his trip to the
East. Litle was 71 years of age. The
body will be taken to his home on Sunday.

ETHEL HORNICK
WILL RETURN
WITH HONORS
Oakland Girl Wins
Stage Laurels.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway,' Jul 20.
When Daniel Frohman brings West
early next year his Lyceum stock com- j
pany for the production of "Trelawney of
the Wells," which has been played in the I
ETHEL HORNICK.
East with such marked success, there will
be in the cast one of Oakland's most tal
ented and beautiful young women. Miss
Ethel Hornick, who this year is support
ing Miss Mary Mannering in "Trelaw
ney" and "Ingenfleld."
Miss Hornick was born and raised In
Oakland, and even now, after several
â  years' absence, calls It her home. When
i It was seen several years ago that she
| gave promise of much histrionic ability
1 she was sent to Boston to study. Progress
was so rapid and Miss Hornick did bo
very well that she soon became an in
structor, and later was signed for an en
gagement with Miss Ada Rehan's com
pany. Several very encouraging appear
ances in Boston and New York were fol
lowed by a trip to England, where Miss
Hornick made her European debut tn
Shakespeare at the Memorial Theater,
ford-on- Avon.
' Miss Hornick la tall, slender and grace.
A_i. â¢
ful. She has a most charming personality
and is a social as well as a stage favorite
wherever she appears. Last summer while
on a visit to her mother Miss HornlcK
was the recipient of many, favors from
society. Mis.-- Mary Barker and Mrs. Jack
Wilson, among others, giving luncheons
in her honor. She is visiting her uncle
John Hornick, at present at his beautiful
town house in Sioux City, lowa, and has
been the guest of honor lately at several
dinners and teas. --â â â¢â -.
In casting "Trelawney" Mr. Frohman
gave -Miss Hornick the part of Miss Tra
falgar Gowar, an old maid. Miss Hornick
accepted it and has made it one of the
most attractive and important of the play.
In powder and hoops and -owned in a
quaint creation of flower-besprinkled silk
and old lace, she seems to have stepped
from some old frame, so dainty and
artistic is she. Her friends are looking
forward with much interest to her ar
rival in California, and she will doubtless
be given a flattering reception, for it will
be her first appearance in the West as one
of a company. Heretofore she has been
seen solely in dramatic work.

MAY RECOVER FROM
THE TERRIBLE WOUNDS
Mrs. Fred Lederer, the Victim of Her
Husband, Has a Chance for
Life.
WOODLAND, July 20.â Mrs. Fred Leder
er, the victim of her husband's homicidal
mania, may recover, notwithstanding the
twenty or more wounds inflicted Wednes
day. That is the hopeful report made by
Dr. Voissard this morning. Wednesday
afternoon she was apparently in a state of
hopeless collapse. The physician did not
believe that she had one chance in a hun
dred to recover. She was so weak from
loss of blood, her nervous prostration was
so complete, her mutilation was so hor
rible and her ghastly wounds so numerous
and many of them so serious that recov
ery seemed to be quite out of the question.
Lederer shows no remorse of conscience.
The recollection of his awful deed does not
affect his appetite and did not disturb his
slumbers Wednesday night. This morning
Under Sheriff Brown, with a view of in
ducing him to make some statement, told
him his wife was dead. The information
was apparently very gratifying, but he de
clined to make any statement further
than to admit that he did the cutting and
with intent to kill.
Lederer has a very unsavory record, but
his quarrels and violent outbursts of pas
sion have been confined to the family cir
cle.
TRIAL OF CORCORAN.
All the Testimony for the Defense
Before the Jury.
WALLACE.. Idaho, July 20.â This
evening the attorneys for Paul Cor
coran, on trail for the murder of James
j Cheyne, announced that they rested.
Mrs. Corcoran, who was on the wlt
i ess stand to-day, said her husband
left home just before 7 o'clock and re
turned shortly after noon on April 29.
He remained until nearly 3 p. m. and
she did not see him again until 9 p. m.
L. J. Simpkins was called to impeach
Superintendent Burch of the Bunker
Hill Company. He was positive that
four soldiers guarded him during the
intervals, but Hurt testimony was
that only one soldier was present. All
questions asked Simpkins were objected
to by the State, and the objections were
generally sustained.
\ The defense asked for the recall of A.
, M. St. Clair, but the court would not
â  allow it. He was then called as de
! fendant's witness. The fact was elicit
jed that he had served a term in the
penitentiary at Deer Lodge, Mont., for
assault with a deadly weapon. This
was the witness who swore to seeing
Corcoran on the train, both when leav
i ing and returning.
Eight witnesses then swore to Cor
coran's good reputation as a law-abid

BLACK JACK BAND
HAS REORGANIZED
Believed That an Attack on the Over-
land Express is Contem
plated.
AUSTIN. July 20.â The Federal authori
ties of the Western District of Texas have
received reliable information of the re
organization of the Black Jack band of
train robbers and its present rendezvous
is the Chispa Mountains in Presidio Coun
ty. It is expected that an attack on the
Southern Pacific overland express is con
templated by the robbers. The express
company's officials have been notified of
the situation.
This desperate band of robbers has been
operating in West Texas, New Mexico
and Arizona for several years. The pho
tographs of several members of the band
are in the hands of the I'nited States
Marshals of the districts in which the'
bold robberies and other offenses have
been committed, but as they seldom enter
a town their recognition and arrest is dif- :
ficult. Over a year ago the band was
driven out of Arizona and they sought !
refuge in the mountains of the State of!
Chihuahua, Mexico. They made. a raid on .
a small settlement and were pursued by
a posse of Mormon colonists and a small
force of rural* s. The robbers were over- \
taken and a fight took place, resulting in j
the killing of two members of the band. '
It was reported at the time that one of \
the men killed was the original Black |
Jack, the leader, but this statement is i
disputed by the authorities, who assert
that he is still alive.
BEARDED WOMAN WITH
A STRANGF DISEASE
Head and Hands Swollen to More
j Than Twice Their Normal
! Size.
! NEW YORK. July 20.â Swollen to enor-
I mous proportions, Mary Fogarty, who is
| more than six feet in height and who has
1 a heavy beard and mustache, was taken
; to the Believue Hospital this evening suf
i fering from a rare disease, known as
i acromegaly. Excitement marked her ar
j rival at Believue among both patients and
I physicians when she was carried into the
i reception office. It was found that the
| patient's head was twice as large as that
of an average man. Her nose was three
times its normal size and her hands twice
as targe as they should be.
As she is more than six feet in height
and has a beard and mustache and gray
hair, her appearance was extraordinary
to a degree. The physicians decided that
the disease had reached a stage so ad
vanced that she can scarcely recover.
News that the peculiar case had been
admitted soon spread throughout the in
stitution, and all hurried to be present.
Few of them had ever seen a patient suf
fering from acromegaly. The general
opinion was that death from exhaustion
would occur in a short time.
BENNETT ON TRIAL.
Accused of Swindling Dairymen in
and About Qilroy.
GILROY, July 20.â The trial of Charles
Bennett, the San Francisco commission
merchant, who is accused of swindling
several prominent dairymen out of hun
dreds of dollars, was heard before Justice
of the Peace Howard Will.;.- to-day. The
prosecution was represented by Deputy
District Attorney Jarman Of San Jose, as
sisted by E. D. Crawford of Gllroy. and
the defense by Alien & Allen of San Fran
cisco. Several witnesses were placed on
the stand to show that Bennett had mis
represented his business by means of bus
iness cards bearing the name of the West
ern Dairymen's Association, at 22S Clay
street, San Francisco. Bennett made a
trip to Gilroy last May and contracted
with Messrs. Eschenburg. Braeme, Carey,
"A'ilkin and others for the shipment of
cheese to him at this address at an ad
vance over the market price. The cheese
was shipped, but the money never ma
terialized. â¢ tf'.tftf
Matthew McCurrie of San Francisco,
who was employed by Kschenburg and
Braeme to find Bennett, gave testimony.
The case has excited much interest in
this locality. tftf â 'â

WILL NOT DISPUTE
THE CLAIM OF JAPAN
The United States Does Not Need
Marcus Island for a Cable
Station.
WASHINGTON, July 20.â au
thorities have known since May of the
intention of Japan to take possession of
Marcus Island. While there is no in
tention of accusing Japan of occupying
the island because she thought the
United States wanted it, it is neverthe
less a fact that cable instructions to the
commanding officer of the collier Nero,
which is making a survey for the Pa
cific cable, contemplated a route in
which Marcus Island was to enter as a
cable station. These instructions have
since been modified because of the de
sire that the cable should touch Amer
ican soil. The route which the ship ls
I now surveying contemplates the laying
tof a cable between Hawaii, Midway
Island and Guam.
Marcus Island, before its occupation
by Japan, was considered American be
i cause of its occupancy by American cit
izens. It is a rocky, precipitous piece of
: land, of little value, without a good
harbor; but this Government has never
' considered it American territory. Ac
cording to an official with whom I
' talked to-night it is not proposed to dis
i pute Japan's claim to its possession.

At the Occidental there registered yes
terday A. Carleton of Washington, D. C.
Mr. Carieton is special agent of the De
partment of Agriculture of the United
States exhibit at the Paris Exposition.
Mr. Carleton speaks with the highest
praise of the way California is proceeding
with her exposition matters. He compli
ments the local commission, which he
says is the only State organization of the
kind that he has cognizance of, and it he
finds so capable to perform the duties in
trusted to its charge that he --.ill leave
all matters pertaining to the agricultural
display of this State entirely in its hands,
as he feels that nowhere else could the
Interests of California be so well pro
tected.
Among the arrivals on the Portland the
other day was "Billy" O'Connor, son of
the well-known mining man. As soon as
Billy landed he went to the Palace and,
getting the where thai, started out to
procure those delights to which his
long sojourn among the desolate ice
| bergs of the north so well entitles him.
j A few minutes afterward the clerk at the
| desk was approached by a couple of mm
I ing men who had not seen civilization for
! years. "Have you seen anything of Mr.
| O'Connor?" they asked. The clerk an-
I swered that he had just left. "Well, we
j must find him," they remarked. "He is
j a good boy and we don't want him to get
the worst of it in this big city." And they
hurried away on their quest. Those who
know young Mr. O'Connor will appreciate
j the humor of this little occurrence. That
was two days ago. Billy is at home and
â  happy. Friends of the mining men have
private detectives out looking for them.
Miss Mould and Miss Van Buren Of the
Frawley Company are having troubles of
their own. Some days ago Miss Mould
remarked that she thought she was a lit
; tle too slender and Miss Van Buren said
1 she thought she herself was something
! like twenty pounds" over weight. A re
i porter, basely taking advantage of these
j maidenly confidences, published the in-
I teresting though delicate facts, and ever
i since the story came out there has been
I nothing but patent medicine men, mas-
I sage artists and physical culture special
j ists thronging the corridors of the Cali
fornia and sending their cards up to the
i two unfortunate actresses, in the hope of
I reaping a little money and a great deal
of advertisement. The two ladies finally
hit on the plan of having Hope Ross re
ceive all visitors. â¢ Miss Ross has a figure
that is as near perfection as anything the
: divinity ever bestowed upon a mortal.
â¢ She impersonates the others. The agent
sends up his card, is admitted to an audi

I cannot improve and retires defeated and

REINCARNATION OF A
BUSH-STREET BOSS
Sara Rainey Is High in the Favor
of the Examiner
scheme to Send Hearst to the U. S. Senateâ Phelan a
Rival â Assembly District Meetings To-Night
to Organize Republican Clubs,
Sam Rainey, once the despised boss
of the Fan Francisco Democratic polit
ical machine. is now the trusted ally
of the Examiner. Gavin McNab, whose
praises were sung by the Examiner, is
no longer exalted as an apostle of pu
rity and reform.
Committeemen belonging to Jasper
McDonald's band of one hundred, the
five score whose authority to boss the
party in San Francisco was derived
from the Democratic Stat-' Central
Committee, cannot understand why
Gavin Mcl Stab gets the cold shoulder
and Rainey the confidence of. the Ex
aminer.
To account for the change of front
and the reappearanoe of Rainey as con
fidential adviser of the Examiner, the
story is told that "A*. R. Hearst desires
to be elected United States Senator from
California. The insiders know . that
Hearst entertains no admiration for
Mayor Phelan, and both the outsiders
and insiders know that the Mayor's re
gard for Hear.-- is too slight for calcu
lation. I: is obvious to all who care
to study the drift of politics under the
â¢surface that Mayor Phelan is in train
ing for the United States Senate. He
expects that the Democratic party will
come day be restored to power in Cali
fornia, and that during the restoration
a Senator may be chosen.
Phelan has lungs, money and ambi
tion. He is not destitute of brains or
lacking In self-esteem. As an all
around talker and a liner-up he can
hold his own with the hardiest of the
rounders. Hearst does not care to in
vite a controversy with a young man
possessing all these accomplishments,
He add prefer to see Phelan destroy
himself by getting on a high horse and
riding rough shod over the regular or
ganization of the party. A sagacious
politician affirms that this is the mean
ing of the Itainey-Examiner combine.
Phelan is to be puffed up, lauded and
heralded as a leader above the party.
In the fullness of his pride he will de
mand the right to name the tick of
the regular convention, and failing to
obtain this prerogative will head an in
dependent movement.
Hearst would be highly pleas- at
th,- sight of Phelan bolting th.- conven
tion and joining th independents. A
candidate for United States Senator
must show a clean record of fidelity to
the party. Bolters seldom win the Sen
atorial prize. Even Republicans who
often treat the party lash with scorn
do not forget hat D. M. Burns Joined
the N. n-Partisans, and that his treach
ery gave to the Democrats the Legis
lature which elected Stephen M. White
to the United States Senate.
If Phelan could be forced into the at
titude of a bolter through the smooth
work of Rainey and the Examiner,
Hearst would consider that a great
point had been gained. It is well un
derstood that Hearst expects the Ex
aminer to secure for him a pliable dele
gation from California to the next
Democratic national convention. Ru
mor has reached the Committee of One
Hundred that Hearst wants a delega
tion that can be used by Boss I broker.
The alliance of Rainey and the Ex
aminer is the leading topic of discussion

in the ranks of the Democratic push:
Only eleven months ago the Examiner
exhausted its resources of display type
to proclaim that Rainey, the infamous,
was politically dead for all time. There
was more glee in the Examiner office
over the political death of Rainey than
the birds exhibited over the killing of
Cock Robin.
In big bold letters across a page of
seven columns the Examiner pro
claimed
â¢"RAINEY IS MAKING HIS
DEATH STRUGGLE AT SACRA
MENTO."
"M'NAB WILL HEAD THE
FORCES AGAINST HIM."
Again in big type running across two
pages the Examiner announced:
"BOSS RAINEY. CREATURE
OF THE RAILROAD AND SUGAR
TRUST, FIERCELY FIGHTING
AGAINST A CLEAN TICKET."
In the Examiner of August 20, 1898,
Rainey's political obituary was thus
published:
THE PASSING
OF SAM RAINEY,
ONCE THE BOSS
Sam Rainey has passed into politi
cal history. High up on the scroll of
those on whom the Democracy of Cal
ifornia has stamped the mark of dis
honor his name *is inscribed. The peo
ple have kicked him into the outer
darkness. He has joined his old part
ner, Buckley, in the colony of polit
ical pariahs from which no man re
turneth.
The Examiner has fought Rainey
ism ever since the boss of the Bush
street stable tried to put on the man
tle which had been torn from the
shoulders of Buckley. It took years
to overthrow that chief among* polit
ical bosses . Buckley was infamous
but able; his successor was simply
infamous.'"
The foregoing is but a sample of a
! big lot of P-ainey roasts in the Exami-
I ncr of last August. This man Rainey,
i who is now the ally and confidential
| adviser of the Examiner, is the same
i old boss of the Bush street stable, who
had tlje infamy but not the ability of
Buckley. His hand is in the politics of
j every Assembly district of San Fran
! Cisco, and no name is placed on the
1 Examiner slate without the advice and
i consent of the resurrected and saintly
Sam. There is no question as to the
identity of the boss. He is not, how
ever, doing politics at the old stand.
He has moved from the Bush street
stables to the Examiner office.
MEETINGS TO-NIGHT.
A Republican Club to Be Or-
ganized in Each As-
sembly District.
To-night In each of the eighteen As- I
sembly districts of San Francisco there
will be a meeting to organize a club un- i
der the auspices of the Republican Coun- :
ty Committee. The meeting will be cal 1 id
to-order in each district at 8 o'clock by \
the committeemen representing *.he dis
trict. It Is proposed that a permanent
organization shall be effected by the elec
tion of a preside) I and secretary and an
enrolling committee of five members The
roll of each club will be kept open at a
convenient place between the hours of 8
and 10 p. m. for six successive days sue- j
ceeding the organization.
Friday evening, July 28, each club will I
meet to elect five delegates to an advisory !
central club, which shall be representa
tive of the district organization. The del
egates to said central club will meet and
organize Wednesday, August 2, at 8 p. m.
It Is the duty of every good Repub
lican of San Francisco to enroll his nam.
on the regular Republican Club of his I
district. A special effort should be made 1
by Republicans to attend the meeting
this evening and take part in the pre*
liminary organization. Good government
can be obtained if 'he citizens will give
time to the consideration of public af
fairs. Plainly, therefore, it is the 'duty j
of Republicans who desire that the city
shall be honestly and efficiently governed -
to attend the meeting in their respective
districts. If they remain at home, round- :
ers, heelers and place seekers may gain
a position of advantage at the outset of
the municipal campaign.
The following places of meeting have
been designated by the Republican Coun
ty Committee:

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL., FRIDAY, JULY 21, 1899.
CALL'S GUESTS SPEND
A DAY IN FAIRYLAND
<j-j C 7 EARI.Y 7<W) school children ac-
NEARLY The Call's invitation to
cepted The Call's Invitation to
attend the cakewalk carnival
|^ [[ matinee given in their honor
yesterday afternoon, and for
three solid hours sat entranced with
the brilliant spectacle that passed and
repassed before their wandering eyes.
It was as. though they had been ad
mitted to the abode of the fairies for
a brief peep at the wonderful things
they had been told about but never
dared hope to Bee. The changing
scenes, with all their gorgeous color
ing! was like a panorama and held
their attention as though they had
been put under hypnotic influence,
but not altogether so; for at Intervals
the spell was broken and the moving
figures of the floor, blazing with gold
and tinsel, wen greeted with sponta
neous bursts of applause, all the more
complimentary because sincerely
given. It was a great day for the lit
tle folks who were being entertained
as the guests of The Call, and it was
a great day for the juvenile artist:.
who contributed to the entertain
ment as well as the grown-up pi . -
fessionals.
The carnival management was pre
pared to receive a big crowd, but it
failed to realize the magnitude of the
task it had been asked to assume.
There was an early gathering in the
street in front of the Pavilion long
fore the hour for the opening of the
doors, and the moment the portals
were swung upon their hinges a rush
was made for the interior that con
tinued until long after 2 o'clock. The
half-dozen ticket takers on duty work
ed as they never worked before and
as they hope never to have to work
again. It seemed to them as though
every child in the city had swooped
down upon them armed with a Call
coupon, and all clamorous for admis
sion to wonderland.
They came' in hordes, some accom
panied by their mammas and others
by their papas or elder sisters, and
-ora" apparently alone, but fully con
fident of their ability to take care of
themselves. By some unexplained
miracle the management finally suc
ceeded In finding seats for all by the
time the signal for the entry of the
grand opening pageant was given
Led by Miss Pearl Hickman, the chief
drum major, attired in her glittering
uniform and carrying a staff as a
symbol of her authority, the proces
sion moved out upon the floor and
the hypnotizing process was well un
der way. The king and queen in their
chariot drawn by half a dozen har
lequins satisfied all doubters that
they were really viewing a fairy spec
tacle, and they proceeded to settle
down to a full enjoyment of the feast.
Tn the center of the floor, near the
entrance to the Pavilion and in full
view of the audience, a large inclosure
had been arranged for the competitors
in the Chinese- baby show and their
parents, and from the tiers of seats by
which they were surrounded the group
of Orientals presented a peculiarly
gorgeous appearance. The little Chi
nese abies had been carefully pre
pared for the beauty test and looked
as handsome and pretty as paint and
cosmetics, together with splendid be-
Jeweled headdresses and beautiful silk
en garments, could make them. Next
were the Juvenile cakewalkers and
fancy dancers. They were the center
of attraction, and after the judges had
made their awards the little Celestial
beauties were surrounded by an admlr

League Democrats Meet
The Democratic Municipal League Club
of the Thirty-first Assembly District held

received from the precinct branches of

Thirty-Second District.
The Phelan Democratic Club of the
Thirtv-sÂ»cond Assembly District met in
the hall at Eighteenth and Florida streets
m, r.ieht to listen to an address by
Charles A. Sweigert. The president, Ed
Lawton. Introduced the speaker, who
made an attach upon corporations, which,
he Mil "stab and bleed the people at the
Sfstol's point." He denounced the Buck-
Invites as political pirates, and warned
true Democrats not to enter into. a com
bination with corruption During his pero
ration, referring to the city, he said.
"where the morning glories dwell on the
hills of twilight." He was tendered a vote
of thanks and the club disposed of some
routine business.
South Side Democrats Meet.
The Twenty-ninth District Democratic
Club held its regular weekly meeting last
night at Baker's Hall. Addresses were
made by K. Porter Ashe, Oscar Hocks
and Colonel Thomas Barry. In opening
his remarks Ashe stated that oefore com-
InK to the meeting he received a note in
forming him that if he Bpoke at Braun
hart's meeting the rival Democratic club
would get sore. The Senator said that
only politeness prevented him from re
turning the note.
Monument -League Active.
A sub-committee of the Lincoln Monu
ment League met last night at. the office
of Judge M. Cooney and ueclded to invoke
the aid of the various Improvement clubs
throughout the city in raising subscrip
tions for the erection of the monument.
CHINESE BABY PRIZE WINNERS.
ing throng of ladies from the audience,
an intermission being announced to
afford an opportunity for a closer In
spection of the gayly bedecked midgets.
The Chinese mammas and papas were
inordinately proud of the attentions
showered upon their offspring, and the
parents of the prize winners made no
effort to conceal their delight. Six
prizes were awarded, three for boys
and three for girls. In addition sev
eral of the babies were selected as
worthy of honorable mention. The
winners of first prizes were given gold
medals made in Chinatown, the suc
cessful contestants being i/oul Tow
and Yung Wing. The second and third
prizes consisted of jeweled headdresses
for girls and Chinese caps for the
boys.
The juveniles were in their glory and
fairly outdid themselves. Frankie

laurels, while Blanche Trelease and

Harry Kispert, a Jeweler, ' Charged
With Robbing His Employer.
. Harry Kispert, a manufacturing jeweler
employe- by Shreve& C 0.," wholesale deal
ers at Market and Fremont streets, was
arrested last night by Detective Graham
and charged at the City Prison with petty
larceny.' .';' :' J ~-'-
For some time past Shreve & Co. have I
been missing small- quantities of gold, and
suspecting that Kispert was the culprit
they decided to place a watch on him.
Yesterday, It is claimed, he was seen to)
appropriate three small pieces of gold, and :
was immediately .taken to task. Kispert j
flrst claimed that he had taken the gold,
intending to make it Into a ring, but \
finally admitted his guilt. On being told j
that he was to be punished for the al- j
leged theft Kispert asked permission to
wash his hands. During the temporary
absence of the men who had detected him
Kispert secretly left the place. Last even
ing he was found at his home in South
San Francisco and taken Into custody. 1
Kispert says the arrest is all a -mistake,
and claims he will be able to establish
his Innocence when the case is heard In
the Police Court.
Social Council's Officers.
Last evening Deputy Taylor, assisted by
Grand Recorder Wall Is as grand marshal, ]
installed the following officers of Social
Council No. 46 .in Coloma Hall. Native
Sons' building, for the current term- of
six months: Miss K. I. Goodell, past
councilor; W. M. Sullivan, councilor; '
George W. Smith, vice councilor; Mrs. K.
A. Adams, Instructor; W. F. Gibson, sec
retary; A. G. Baker, assistant secretary;
F. Ushaus, treasurer; Mrs. J. S. Cog-gins,
prelate; Mrs. Alice Goodall. marshal; Mrs. !
J. Hanley, warden; Mrs. Minnie Drossell,
guard; Mrs. S. Crouch, sentry; R. T. ,
Baccus, F. C. Adams and W. J.
O'Shaughnessy, trustees. After the cere
monies there was an adjournment to the
banquet hall, where a collation was
served and there were music, songs and
speeches.
Rag-Time Hayes and Tamales
At Kapp & Street's Tamale Grotto nightly. â¢
Harry Mangels gave an exhibition that
was applauded to the echo. Irene
Davis' Castanet dance, Lena Hall's co
covianne dance, Irene Wilson's skirt
dance. Alma l'â  wen's contortion dance,
Edna Honn's specialty dance, the Cu
pid dance by Daisy Belle Kormal and
the Highland "fling by Adele Nelson
were all enthusiastically applauded, as
were others too numerous to mention.
The usual professional, society and
amateur cakewalks were put on and
contributed their full share to the en
tertainment.
Altogether The Call has every reason
to' feel well satisfied with the result of
its effort to afford an afternoon's en
tertainment for the school children of
San Francisco, and that the latter
were satisfied was amply evidenced by
their actions.
The evening programme was un
usually elaborate; in fact, the carnival
improves, like good wine, with age.
Of course, the feature of the show was
the electric cake-- alk. which appears
to have made a decided hit, and the
three thousand people who composed
the audience last night applauded it
enthusiastically. It is a novelty and
some fears were at first expressed that
the wires which supply the currents
for the lights might become detached
while the dancers were going through
their evolutions and spoil the effect,
and tins did happen for a moment on
Wednesday night but Al White, the
electrician, has succeeded In arrang
ing tin batteries so that this diffi
culty has been entirely obviated. The
three figures flitting gracefully across
the floor ablaze with electric lights
is a treat to all who admire the beau
tiful. Miss Hickman, Miss I.a Salle
and Mr. Barr have received many com
mendations for the success of their
latest novelty.
The delsartian cakewalk and artis
tic poslngs, under the direction of Mrs.
L. Honn, also caught the fancy of a
large majority of the spectators, many
of whom appear to i.,- just beginning
to realize that a delsartian cakewalk
is slightly different from a plantation
cakewalk.
Last evening marked the beginning
of the contests for the prizes to be
awarded by the carnival management,
The contests are being judged by J. M.
Cumming of this city, Harry C. Blair
of Sacramento and L. C. Foster of
Portland, Or., and the last two at
least are preparing to take the first
train out of town as soon as the final
decisions are announced, as there are
sure to be a number of bitterly disap
pointed contestants. The professionals
went through the- preliminary "heat."
and the judges selected live couples to
compete in tie- finals to-night as fol
lows, the others being dropped: J.
Walker Cole and Georgie Brown, A. F.
Williams and .Miss Rosseau, Everett
Brown and Miss Simmons. F. G. Till
man and lady, and Mr. McMahon and
Annie Kelly. The juveniles and the
society cakewalkers also had their pre
liminaries and will go on again to
night, the finals to be decided Saturday
evening.
This afternoon there will be another
matinee for the children, the special
features being a congress of juvenile
cakewalkers and fancy dancers in ad
dition to the regular programme. This
evening the Compaions of the Forest,
twelve circles, will be in attendance
and in addition to the â  championship
contests the electric cakewalk and
other special features will be put on.
THE GREAT EXCURSION TO

reports that the public interest in the!
Santa Cruz excursion next Sunday con- I
tinues unabated, the encampment of the
League . of the Cross Cadets being the
chief attraction. Excursionists will

The season at Santa Cruz is now at its
height, and no more interesting spec
tacle can be witnessed than to watch
the throngs of pleasure-seekers at the
bathing pavilions. At this time of the
year the weather at Santa Cruz is de
lightful and the event of next Sunday
affords a splendid opportunity for the
people of this locality to escape for
one day at least the prevailing winds
and fogs. Excursionists will have five
hours at their disposal after their ar
rival at Santa Cruz. ;.: v
Round-trip tickets ($2) are now on
sale at the Grand Hotel ticket office,

tained at the ferry ticket office on the
morning of the excursion.
Trains leave ferry landing, foot of
Market street, at 7:4.". a. m. Returning
arrive in San Francisco at 8:06 p. m.
For the information of would-be ex
cursionists it can be understood that
the sink near Alameda has been re
paired and trains are now running on
regular time.
Drunken Small Boys.
Matthew Brady, Joseph .Toy and Charles
Carston, small boys, were arrested yester
day-morning by Policeman McNamara on
Brannan street, near Fifth, in a drunken
stupor. When they recovered their senses
in the City Prison they said they got the
liquor from a saloon-keeper on Bryant
street, but. refused to give his name. The

BAG DEALERS FORM

about fourteen of the large Â»n-P?rte"Â£JJ

It is a well-known fact that the. bag
market has been in a demoralized cond.
tion ever since last year, when on account
of the shortage in crops the dealers lost
vast amounts of money and were left
with large quantities of bags on their
i hands. The price this year has been as
low as 5 cents, which, it is claimed, is
I lower than the importing price, that is,
I including interest, long storage and insur
i ance This price recently advanced to
'5% cents and slowly stiffened to 5% and
I oi 4 cents. The dealers say it is to guard
; themselves against loss this season that
i they have agreed to "lock up' over 5.000.
--1 000 ' bags â¢by temporarily withdraw
! them from sale. They disclaim any inten-
I tion of forming a trust to force prices up,
, but say they have simply combined as a
; measure of precaution, One large im
: porter in discussing the situation said:
1 "We have not combined to force prices
i up, but only to guard against future
i losses. Something has to be done, and
I it was decided that the best way out of
i the difficulty was to remove a certain
j number of bags from the possibility of :
I sale If there was any combination to I
! raise the price bags would be selling at 10
i cents each to-day."

With the sound of hammering fists and J
the splashing of gore the Lung divorce
Milt, as far as the evidence is concerned, j
ram- to a fitting end yesterday. From
the beginning the divorce scandal of the j
navy has developed dramatic scenes. A
few days ago Mrs. Lung hurled herself
Into the corridor outside Judge Murasky's
courtroom and proceeded to batter Hen ;
True, a witness in the case. Then she pro
ceeded to enact a scene which caused an j
adjournment of court. Yesterday it was
not the principals in the scandal but the i
lawyers who made things howl, and out
of it all but one lesson has been learned. |
Crittenden Thornton has been made aware
that it is expensive to attack opposing
counsel; also that it is not safe to strike
a smaller man, even though he may be |
seated at the time. " â¢' \ 'â â¢'â .-_ .
The cross-examination of Mrs. Lung by
Mr Thornton was the cause of the diffi
culty Mrs. Lung had testified that dur-
Ing a visit at a certain hotel she had been
Insulted on two occasions by one of the
guests and said that her husband had
avenged her by slapping his face. "Don't
you know." said Thornton, "that the -lif- .
Acuity at the hotel is simply the result of
your imaginative brain?" Attorney
George D. Collins, who represents Mrs.
Lung objected to the questionâ that it
was uncalled for and ungentlemanly.
"What's that?" said Thornton.
"The reporter will read my objection,"
said Mr. Collins. The reporter read the
objection, and then Thornton, who was on
ids feet, made a rush" at Collins, who
was seated at the bar. Thornton swung
a vicious blow at Collins' head, but Col
lins ducked, and the fist of his assailant
just grazed his cheek. At the same time
Collins' fist swung around and it crunched
Into the Ups of Thornton. Thornton's
head went back from the force of the
blow, the blood spurted from his lips and
they clinched. Over they went, the chair
in which Collins was seated crushing un
der the weight of the combatants.
At this point Bailiff Cooper sailed into
the fight. He made a reach for Thorn
ton's collar, â¢ but the frenzied lawyer I
launched out from the rear and landed
one of his heels on the bailiff's right
ankle. It stopped Cooper but an instant,
however, and then he lifted Thornton
back Into his seat, and' the battle was
over judge Murasky, who had sprung
from his seat at the opening of hostilities,
Immediately adjudged Thornton guilty of
contempt of court. Mr. Collins then arose
and said that he hoped the court would'
be lenient with Mr. Thornton, as he evi
dently had been actuated by uncontrolla
ble impulse.
â¢â¢J don't want any excuses made for me
bj Mr. Collins." said Thornton. "What I
did I did with deliberation and am willing
to take the consequences."
Thereupon Judge Murasky. fined Thorn
ton $50, but as he did. not have the amount
in his 'pocket the court granted him five
days in which to procure the necessary j
coin. A minute order of the action of the â¢
court was made, and the cross-examina- I
tion of Mrs. Lung continued. This con
cluded the case was submitted on briefs, j
All matters of fact being clear to the
court, but one thing remains to be set- |
tledâthe matter of Dr. Lung's residence.
Should it be found that under the law he
has no residence In this city and county
his case will fall and he will have to at
tain a residence before he can wage sue- j
cessful litigation against his wife Eliza;
beth for a divorce, "a vincule matrimoni.
Private Windrow Must Stay.
Richard Windrow, a 20-year-old private
in the Thirty-fifth United States Volun
teers, was brought before United States
District Judge de Haven yesterday and
discharged from the army by order of the
court. Windrow's guardian had him
brought up on habeas corpus, and the
youth has lost the opportunity of visiting
the Philippines.
there 'in? been no appreciable advance ln
prices so far, there is no telling what
will happen when all the "free" bags, or
those not bound by the agreement, will
have been sold. There is no doubt that
the farmer will be called upon to pay a
higher rate than he is paying now.
Another circumstance that is affecting
the. market to a considerable extent is
the fact thai four or five million bags
are on the British ship Macduff, now 162
days from Calcutta. Her destination is
Portland, Or., where the demand for hags
is bout to begin. No uneasiness, how
ever, is felt at her non-appearance as
yet. and only 20 per cent reinsurance has
been offered. The average trip is about
125 days, and should the vessel fail to
materialize the bag .situation would be
further complicated. A large per cent of
her cargo has also been pledged by the
dealers as not being for sale until all
other bags are disposed of.
It will require about "5.000.000 bags to
move the barley and wheat crops in this
State. Oregon, Washington and the con
tiguous territories, and should the Mac
duff never arrive it would mean the tak
ing up of all bags no-* on hand or in
process of manufacture, with hardly
enough to go around. It the Macduff does
not come in two weeks, the price will
certainly jump to 6 cents or higher. So
says one of the importers who lias sub
scribed to the agreement. This he ar
gues, will place the handling of bags on
a paying basis.
Another feature of the bag situation is
the fact that signers of the agreement
are selling bags, not pledged, to outsid
ers and it is said that the latter are buy
ing them on a speculation, seeing that
the price is bound to go higher, when
the combine is left with the bass cov
ered by the contract. One of the biggest
importers denied that there was any bag
trust in the deal. . Â
"It is not our Intention, said tie, to
raise bags to any unreasonable price. "Ac
simply have come to the conclusion that
we must stop selling at a loss. Ihe ar
rival of the Macduff *-"â  â¢ a eÂ»' e . th *L.Tf}" 0
affair, and with her cargo there will be
bags enough to supply the demand. I
am certain that the prices will not ma
fertalH- advance. We do not want the idea
to go out that we are trying to squeeze
he farmers for that is not. our Inten
tion Ban sold at a further losses
â :, ad it is to prevent further
that we have subscribed to the agree
ment."
SULLIVAN IS NOT THE MAN.
I Mrs. Lecari's Recollection Was Not
Good as to the Masked, Would-Be
Robber.
Captain Gillin and Detectives Graham
and Fitzgerald, after a earetul "vvesn^
gation of all the facts surrounding the
arrest of Daniel, alias "Pop" Sullivan,
as being on- of the masked men who or
dered "all hands up" and did the shoot
ing at the store of Lecari on the san
Kruno road on last Monday night, were
compelled to turn him loose last evening.
The Mission Police Department, in order
to give Lecari and his wife a fair chance
to identify Sullivan, had him placed
among five of the trustees at the Central
station yesterday. They at once identified
him as being one of the masked men who
entered the store. Not quite satisfied
with this proof Captain Gillin instructed
his detectives to make a further investi
gation of Sullivan's whereabouts on the
night of the hold-up. _
Acting on these instructions Graham
' and Fitzgerald ascertained from reliable
persons that Sullivan was elsewhere on
' the night in question. With this informa
tion at hand Captain Gillin ordered, the
j discharge of Sullivan from custody.
Kirn Oy Is Under Age.
Judge Lawlor rendered a decision yes
terday in the case of Kirn Oy, the young
girl who was rescued from a life of shame
in Spofford alley a few weeks ago. Ah
'Sgun, who alleges that she is- the girl's
mother swore out a writ of habeas cor
pus. After the hearing yesterday Judge
Lawlor dismissed the writ and remanded
the girl to the custody of the Methodist
Mission. The court said that during the
hearing of the writ he had been forced to
listen to the most infamous perjury mi
the part of the alleged mother in his ex
perience. Such perjury is seldom pre
sented in a court, he said, and if the
proofs can be found the woman should
be prosecuted for her crime. The decision
rendered, the alleged mother set up a
howl and a wail that made the corridors
ring. She was finally dragged downstairs,
however, placed in a hack and sent to her
home.
