LONDON, June 8.- The I^>n
don Filipino junta asserts the
Pope has foi o Wash
ington the protesi against the
Bses of Americans In the
Philippines, which his
received from the religious or
ders in Manila.
LONDON. June B.â A special dis
patch from Manila to-day says it
is reported to-day that. Ag'uinaldo has
dissolved the Filipino Congress and
has proclaimed himself dictator.
WASHINGTON, June S. â Officials
here are in doubt as to whether Aguln
ald". in. declaring his dictatorship, is
animated by a desire to rid himself of
hi? refractory generals, Pilar and Luna,
or whether he aims to consolidate in hi.*
own hands the power to make terms oT
peace. It is known from "the reports
of President Bchurman of the American
Philippine Commission ifcat these two
generals owe only faint allegiance to
â¢'aid". and their attitude toward
the peace negotiations has made these
negotiations ineffectual, the civilian
members of the Filipino side of the
joint commission being 1 completely
overawed and dominated by the
military element controlled by these
generals. It is believed here if Aguin
aldo can bend these men to his will and
assume supreme control he will at
once make terms for peace, being able
to secure better terms for himself than
he would otherwise.

The Second Oregon Infantry is pre
paring to sail for home, but departure

The rumor that Aguinaldo has estab- j

in favor of an autonomous form of
government is credited by leading Fili

General Luna while on their way to

captured commissioner, has challenged
Luna to fight a duel on account of the

FIGHTING TO CONTINUE
DURING THE WET SEASON
NEW YORK. June 8. The Herald's
Washington correspondent sends th"
following: Secretary Hay has received
from civilian members of the Philip
pine Commission their individual views
reeardlng the war Bituation. In the
main these are encouraging, showing,
according to an official with whom J
talked, that the Insurgent force j s rp _
Buced to 10.000 men: thai Aguinaldb is
hesitating as lo what his future line of
conduct will he, and that most () f the
natives owning property in the archi
pelago favor the enforcement By the
United States of sovereignty over the
.slands. The oonfmlssii â¢ inited
Dn the following propositions, instruc
tions in accordance with which were
lent to General Otis and President
Schurman several days ago:
Firstâ That the .natives appreciate
the military superiority of the Ameri
can troops, and that it is desirable to
rontinue to use it In such manner dur
ing the rainy season as to keep alive
the fear which the operations of Otis'
command have created.
Secondâ That it is desired in the in
terest of the early establishment of
peace that no opportunity should be
oat to educate the natives, as the com
mission has done in the past, in order
that they may understand the benefi
cent intentions of this Government.
While the commission is to continue
its negotiations with the insurgents,
recent advices show that it will not be
very active in this direction for some
time.
General Otis will continue his opera
tions and continued success on the part
it the American troops during the
rainy season will, the officials believe,
have the effect of making the insur
gents too tired and apprehensive to
withstand the vigorous assaults which
will be made when the dry season be-

DISHONESTY
OF STANDARD
OIL TRUST
Eight Grades Taken From
Two Tanks, the Faucet
Being Neatly Juggled.
COMPETIIION KILLED
All Kinds of Prices Charged and
Mean Practices to Force Out
Its Rivals.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, June B.â The Indus
trial Commission resumed it:' Investi
gation ol trusts, the Standard oil Com
pany receiving especial attention. W.
H. Clark of Ohio, who until last Febru
ary was employed by the Standard Oil
Company in various towns In that
State, but was then suspended, testified
that while employed at Marietta, the
Standard had ousted other companies
from the business by competition and
then put up the price of oil.
â¢Mark said that eight nominal grades
of oil were sold nut of only two tanks,
the faucet being turned in different di
rections for different grades. This was
he said, under instructions from
the managers of the Standard Com
pany, Messrs. Matthews and Hollings
worth. <Mnrk also said that tho com
pany bought :ind sold turpentine, but
before selling it would put six <<r seven
gallons of gasoline in each barrel of
turpentine.
At Columbus Clark was the cashier of
ih<* Standard Oil Company. At that
poim he said much oil was adulterated.
For instance, miners' nil was made by
mixing in a little cottonseed oil. Here
the Standard Company started with
what is called the Shoemaker Oil Com
pany. This was a purely Standard es
tablishment, he testified, its men being
paid by the Standard Company, but it
was mnrif to appear to be an indepen
dent concern and was used as a blind.
At Springfield Clark said he was a
wagon salesman, and the instructions
there were to get trade regardless of
the price. Some refined oil was sold as
low as 4 cents, and here also as many
as four nominal grades of oil were
taken from one tank. Rebates were
made when necessary. When he had
spoken to the management of the dis
honesty of these practices he had been
told that it was not for him to say
about such matters, but to do what he
was told.
At T'rbana, he said, he was manager
for the standard Company. Here a
competitor was driven out by a threat
to force the price down to 1 cent a gal
lon. The competitor afterward went to
th> Poorhouse. Witness for a time wafe
manager in Newark. Here thÂ« work
was very hard because of the great
range of prices. There wen twenty
five different figures used there. One

The witness testified that at Newark
the company bought a building from

competitive business, and Clark, with
other men. went into the buildinp In
the absence of the competitor, loaded
the building on carts and carried it
away. For this he ( Clark > was com

SACRAMENTO AND YOLO
COUNTIES MAY BATTLE
Good Prospect of a Merry War Unless
a Peace Conference Is Called
to Fix Matters.
SACRAMENTO. June B.â There is a
prospect for a war between th>- counties
of Volo and Sacramento unless ,-i peace
conference is called to patch up existing
differences. Yolb and Sacramento have
not dwelt in very close brotherhood fir
some time, owing- to the habit of the
Sacramentaiis to build l<?vees a little hJtrli
er th;,n their Yolo neighbors across tlie
river, thereby offering to the dwellers !n
the tule belt g surer prospect of being
drowned out a* regular Intervals.
Since the erection of the Elkhorn ease.
ment conslueraahle of this aggravation
has been removed, but the Yolo residents
along the river have a new hone of con
tention. There is a ferry at Frcepor-,
r-ljrht miles down the river, connecting
FOIO with Sacramento County. The ferry
is Downed by John Soto. Every t'me. a
farmer living on the Yolo side deslr.d to
cross over to the Sacramento shore nÂ»- bad
to pay the ferryman's tribute. Finally,
after this ruftnm had been followed for
years, the farmers on the Yolo ski" and
several on the Sacramento side, reinforced
by Sacramento merchants, petitioned the
Supervisors of this county for a fr.^e ferry
at Free port Meanwhile Soto applied to
the Supervisors for a renewal of the
franchise, and the petitioners employed
counsel and fought against it. However
the Hoard of Supervisors yesterday form
ally renewed the franchise held by flito.
and in effect reminded the Yolo residents
that if they wanted to come to Sacramen
to they should make their Supervisors
build them good roads that would take
them to this city by way of the Volo
bridge. The resident's of the locality in
terested in the ferry, however, have not
taken kindly to this friendly advice, but
instead have started a petition addressed
to the Roard of Supervisors of Yolo Coun
ty nsking it to impose a license of $50 per
month upon every grocer, butcher, baiter
and other supply dealer who drives nvt-r
from Sacramento County to transact busi

NEW york, June B.â ln a private
letter received by the Herald to-day
from a distinguished Cuban, now resi
dent of the T'nitPii Stairs, is ;i most
sensational statement about the plans
of thr> irreconcilable Cubatl leaders
The writer Is conservative, and is in
a position to know what is groins on at
present in Cuba. The information is
as follows:
"The latest story from Cuba, whirh
I have every reason to bplleve, having
b.>en told me by a prominent Cuban
whoso intimacy with the leaders in Ha

is that the former revolutionary ele

necessity and gracefully, to outward
appearances, accept American inter
vention.
"At the end of two years, however,
if Cuban independence is not acknowl
edged and the government transferred
to the Cubans, the torch is to be ap
plied from one end .of the island to the
other, by which means all foreign in
vestments will lie destroyed.
"When it is considered that the
wealth of Cuba Is dependent on its
agricultural development, chiefly cane
and tobacco, and that a firebrand
maliciously applied in a dry cane field
would cause the destruction of thou
sands of dollars of valuo in a single
night, the enormity of the plot becomes
apparent."

NEW EVIDENCE
AGAINST DIER
IS UNEARTHED
Chain of Circumstances
Tighten About Suspected
Slayer of Lorraine.
THEY HAD QUARRELS
Marin County Officials Believe That
the Missing Wojdchoppsr's Body
Will Soon Be Found.
Special Dispatch to ThÂ» Call.
The authorities of Marin Coun
ty unraveling the mystery of the
disappearance of Peter Lorraine,
have made visible progress in that j
they have discovered a motive for
the possible killing of Lorraine by
Dier, the suspect now in jail. It
is true the motive is puerile. A
quarrel, nevertheless, over the most
trivial matter has more than once
led to homicide.
SAN RAFAEL; June B.â Evidence of
a startling nature, tending to in
crease the suspicions of the au
thorities against Suspect James
Dier. was unearthed to-day at
. Carson Canyon by Sheriff Taylor and
| Detective Ed Gibson. Both officials are
I now absolutely convinced that Peter
Lorraine, the aged woodehopper of
Marin County's "Black Hole*" has been
! ruthlessly murdered by a bloodthirsty
assassin, and they have secured evi
dence that they believe will be suffi
: cient to send the ' prisoner, who lan
i guishes here in the County Jail, to the
1 gallows if the missing woodchopper's
body is found hidden in the tangled
: underbrush close to his lone hut.
Runyon Sabrinus. an aged inhabit
i ant of Carson Canyon, who had been
' the missing woodchopper's boon com
panion, and his brother, Charley Sa
' brinus, an employe or John Enos' lum-
I her camp, made revelations to Sheriff
Taylor and Detective Gibson this after
j noon which tightened- th" tins of
guilt which the. authorities are leaving
no stone- unturned to forge about their
prisoner. Runyon Sabrinus has sup
plied the only tangible information
which furnishes a motive for the al-
I leged murder.
A day or so before Lorraine disap
j peared he became Involved in a heated
; quarrel with Dier over the killing of
one of the former's pet cats. According
: to the story which Sabrinus related in
detail to Sheriff Taylor and Detective
I Gibson to-day, Lorraine accused Dier
! of having killed, the cat, and while the
â  two woodchoppers were angrily dis
i cussing the matter he was passing the
i cabin, and, fearing that Dier, who was
] much younger and stronger than Lor
raine, would attempt violence. Sabrinus
remained within hearing distance. They
did not come to blows, but Sabrinus
claims. that .Dier was acutely agitated,
j and from his threatening attitude he
I judges in the light of subsequent events
that the quarrel was serious enough to
end in bloodshed!
Detective Gibson and Sheriff Taylor
agree with Sabrinus in this opinion, and
they had little hesitancy in stating to
night, after having a lengthy interview
with the suspect, that If "Pete" Lor
raine has been murdered they have the
right man in custody. Charley Sabrinus
volunteered statements to-day which
increased the suspicions of the officials
against their prisoner.
The day after Lorraine mysteriously
dropped out of sight Dier was so vis
ibly perturbed that he could not work.
Sabrinus, who was chopping wood with
a fellow workman, on the side of the
cnnyon, says he saw Dier pacing rest
lessly up and down the road with his
ax on his shoulder. Later in the day
Sabrinus came face to face with Dier
on the road. In telling his story to De
tective Gibson to-day Sabrinus stated
that Dier was so unusually excited
when they met on that day on the road
that he feared Dier would attempt to
strike him with the ax. Sabrinus' rela
tions with the prisoner had always been
extremely friendly, but he stated that
Dier's actions on that day were so pe
culiar that he feared the prisoner might
do him violence.
Another suspicious circumstance was
revealed, which Dier and his fellow
woodchoppers failed to mention when
he was placed under arrest. A few
days after Lorraine's disappearance
Dier left the camp, so- Sabrinus states,
and did not return for several days. He
said before leaving, as he told one
woodchopper, that he was going to San
Francisco, and another that he was
only going down the road a short dis
tance. .
Sheriff Taylor and District Attorney
Mclsaac left here early this morning in
a double team and drove to Carson
Canyon. They were joined later by De
tective Gibson, whom Chief Lees had
detailed to assist the authorities of
Marin in unraveling the mystery. Gib
son surveyed the situation carefully and
I was not long In forming the opinion
that the body of "French Pete" lies
hidden close to his lonely abode. They
beat the underbrush close to the cabin
for a short time, but as both Gibson
and Taylor were particularly anxious
to secure whatever evidence they might
| be able to find against the suspect, the
search for the body was quickly aban
doned. 'â¢â¢-.' -
The officers will leave here early to
morrow morning, and when they arrive
at the lumber camp they will commence
a systematic search for Lorraine's
body. In the hunt for the missing wood
chopper's body they will be assisted by

ST. LOUIS. Juno 8. â A dispatch from Lebanon. Mo., says: Congressman
Richard P. Bland at 4 o"clock this afternoon was growing steadily worse.
He was unconscious and his death might be looked for at almost any

LEBANON. Mo., June 8. â At 10 p. m. Mr. Bland appeared somewhat

(in returning from Carson Canyon
this evening Detective Gibson and
Sheriff Taylor closeted themselves with
Dter in his roll for over two hour?. He
sti!! protested his innocence, but when
Gibson cross-questioned him he made
Several contradictory statements. When
told of the important evidence which
they had amassed Dier almost broke
down, lie was extremely nervous and
shifted from one end of his cot to the
other. His replies were spasmodic, and
when pressed for .in answer which
might incriminate him Dier reminded
his inquisitors that he was not com
pelled to make any statement before
his preliminary examination. He in
quired particularly as to the attitude
of the public toward him. and when
told that the entire country was in
tensely excited over Lorraine's disap-
pearance he said:
"Well. I guess the whole world is
against me now." When Gibson and
Taylor left the prisoner he was on the
verge of collapse. The following signed
statement of Sheriff Taylor is self
explanatory:
1 am convinced that if Lorraine has
been murdered we have the right man. ;
The evidence against him is pretty strong!
nnd his demeanor is that of wp who re- |
alizes his position tn be pretty bar). De
tective Gibson is of the same opinion. The :
most absurd thing in connection, with the
whole affair is the slush printed about
Miss Bertha Stedman. in which she is i
represented as a female Gahoriau or.
Sherlock Holmes. To the best of my |
knowledge the girl never was in ("arson
Canyon until to-day. She did not no- |
tify me of the circumstances at all; and
her letter was sent to the Marin Journal I
three days after John F.nos told me of j
Lorraine's disappearance.

WHOM HE CAPTURED
Special Police Officer Carroll of Sac

Wound.
SACRAMENTO, June 8.-W. A. Carroll,
a special police officer, who patrols a beat
in the southeastern part of the city, was
shot l>y a burglar about 2 o'clock this
morning and seriously wounded. The bul
let entered the officer's neck. Carroll h:xd

PRICE FIVE CENTS.
KRUGER MAY
NOW GET AN
ULTIMATUM
Utter Failure of the Recent
Conlerence Between Mil
ner and Oom Paul.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOXDOX, June B.â The advices re
ceived here to-day from South Africa,
emai.ating from British sources, show
more completely the utter failure, of the
recent conference at Bloemfontein be
tween President Kruger and the Brit
ish High Commissioner. Sir Alfred Mil
ner.
A- dispatch from Matjesfonceio. sn:s
Sir Alfred Milner's proposals included
granting the I'itlanders additional
s.ars in the Rand district, and that
President Kruger, under pressure,
linally offered three additional seats.
The British High Commissioner there
upon pointed out the inadequacy of the
President's proposal, adding that he
had come to the conference in the hope
of being able to inform her Majesty's
Government that the President of the
Transvaal Government was able to af
ford such liberal measures of reform
as would enable the T'itlaiiders to help
themselves and relieve the Government
of the obligations to intervene in order
to redress particular grievances.
Throughout, it is added. President
Kruger sought to use the franchise pro
posals as the means of obtaining a
promise to settle the differences under
the convention hy arbitration, but the
British Commissioner refused to treat
the two subjects as interdependent,
taking the ground that international
reform in the Transvaal was necessary
in any case in order to preserve the in
dependence of the republic and as re
gards arbitration there were certain
questions upon which it cou4d not he
admitted, while on other questions ar
bitration was possibly admissible pro
vided a suitable tribunal was suggested
not involving the introduction of a for
eign povjer, which the governments
would never allow.
The morning: papers are beginning to
talk seriously nf the possibility of war
in South Africa. Mr. Chamberlain, Sec
retary of State for the Colonies, in his
speech in the House of Commons yes
terday, announced that his reply to the
petition of I'itlanders, which had been
held back pending 1 the result of the con
ference at Bloemfontein, wouTd now be
presented to the Transvaal.
This reply is semi-officially described
as "explicit but conciliatory," but it ia
believed to be in the nature of a prac
tical ultimatum. The resources of di
plomacy are regarded as exhausted
with the failure of the conference.2

Judge Budd Renders an Interesting
Decision at Stockton.
STOCKTON. June B.â An important de
cision was rendered by Judge Budd to-day
in the cast- of P. Maggiori against Ernest
Rifi. on appeal from Justice Parker's
court. The case was one in which the
plaintiff, who had been hired by six men,
the defendant one of them, had brought

Parker decided that the defendant was
not liable, and the plaintiff's attorneys

could not have prevented it any more
than you. could dam up Niagara."
When asked If the sentiment of the
convention was directed against any
paiticular trust, as, for instance, the
Standard Oil Company, Mr. Hanna
said:
"No, the Standard Oil Company has
done more for the State of Ohio than
any other corporation doing business
within its borders."
"When asked what was the secret of
ex-Mayor McKisson's opposition to
him the Senator said slowly and. sav
agely: "He is a d d, cold-blooded
scoundrel. He is ambitious for office.
I had to fiaht in this State men like
him, be well as the Democrats. The
people of th State know what kind of
man I am. They know I have spent
my time and money freely; that I have
sacrificed more for the party than any
other man in it, and that's why they
stood by me in these campaigns. Mc-
Kisson and his kind are double-dyed
scoundrels."

the Hanna Interview published in the

"If Mr. Hanna is correctly reported,
his ignorance and amazing effrontery
are simply appalling. That he should

is one of considerable moment to work

MINISTER STORER
HAS BEEN FOUND
NEW YORK, June B.â Washington special to the Hei*fi4|*Â«j^:, Bel
lamy Storer, Minister of the United States to Spain, su\.ri*dÃ+iMm a % Se
bastian to-day for Madrid. Mr. Storer will reach MadfidJUÃ KiP'rug
was expected there. It was the original intention tliatPP^Wjiuuuw'be. :\'
ceived by the Queen Regent about the same time that theHlHic d'Arcos yras
received by President McKinley, and the general date fixed was this week.
The Duke arrived in Washington, however, last week, and the President
and Secretary Hay decided there was no reason why they should wait for
the arrival of Mr. Storer in Madrid. This is the explanation of Mr. Storer's
apparent disappearance, nothing being heard from him since he left Paris,
and it was not known until to-day that he was at San Sebastian.
WASHINGTON, June S.â The State Department having located Bellamy
Storer, our Minister to Madrid now wants it to appear that 'the officials
have known of his whereabouts all along. They claim he was on leave, but
the truth is that yesterday they did not know where he was. A telegram
received says the tardy Minister is at San Sebastian, a summer resort on
the southern coast of Spain, patronized by the Spanish court and the fash
ionable world generally during the warm season. It was also learned that
the Queen Regent of Spain has been there for several days. Word has
been received here that the Queen and her suite, as well as Minister Storer,
nre about to go to Madrid, and it is a fair inference that the trip is made
principally for the purpose of receiving the new United States Minister at
court. It is therefore more than likely that the presentation of Mr. Storer
will take place within a day or two, thus completing the last formality in the
formal resumption of negotiations between Spain and the United States.

Trial of George Puttman for the
Murder of John Showers at

Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO. June B.â The convicts
who witnessed the killing of John Show
ers by George Puttman at Folaom a few
weks ago arc not going to let a chance
go by to enjoy a junket outside the prison
walls, and at the same time probably es
cape from their captors. With the excep
tion of one, the witnesses for the defense
who were called up.on fur depositions de
clined to furnish them, stating that they
would nut testify units;; allowed to come
to Sacramento for the purpose. When
Oppenheimer was tried in Sacramento
some months ago for the murder of a fel
low-convict a number of fellow-prisoner?
were brought down from Folsom to testify
in the case. From the moment they left
the prison until aft< r the usual delays
they were returned thereto the convrcts
were ;: constant source of worry to those
who were resporslhle for their custody.
The opinion has been publicly expressed
here that the convicts at the prisons in
somf manner received tips as to the time
of the occurrence of a murder in order
that they- might be around to witness it
and have an opportunity for a trip to
town.
Be this as it may. when Puttman's case
came up in the Superior Court JudÂ£e
Hughes appointed' "Warren E. Doan. offi

to go to Folsom with the attorneys and
obtain the depositions of the convict wit

prisoners who said they would not tes

Most Sensational Case
Now on Trial.
THE STORY OF STOLEN BONDS
'â¢RED CHRIS" STREEK POSES AS
A SCAPEGOAT.
"Sleepy" Burke, the Once Famous
Safe-Blower, Who Turned
State's Evidence, on the
Witness Stand.
Special Dispatch to Thf> Call.
CHICAGO. June B.â What promises to
be one of the must sensational cases
in the criminal annals of Cook County
was resumed in Judge Gary's court
room to-day, "Red Chris" Streek be
ing on trial charged with complicity
in the Schrage bond robbery of three
years ago. For a long time the per
petrators eluded capture and it was
openly charged that prominent police
officials were implicated in hushing tb*
affair up and assisting the criminals!
to escape.
In his opening address to the jury.
Attorney James T. Brady, for the de
fense, asserted that sensational evi
dence would be offered by Streek, that
his client was the scapegoat of th>
police to suffer the penalty that b< -
longed elsewhere, and that "Sleepy"
Burke was the ringleader of the hand
of robbers, and that when he saw th
doors of the penitentiary opening to
receive him, he conceived the idea of
turning State's evidence and laying th
charge upon an innocent man, to which,
in order to shield themselves, the police
readily assented.
"Sleepy" Burke was the first witness
called b->- the State, and the famous ex
safe blower took the stand. He told oÂ£
going to Schrage's house with "Red
Chris," Gordon, Baker, Hunt and James
Muldoon.
Burke said that after the old man
was bound and gagged the bonds and
money, aggregating $45,500, were taken
and divided among the band. The
bonds, he said, were subsequently
turned over to "Red Chris," who said
that all that was necessary to receive
dollar for dollar for the bonds whs a
little patient waiting.
"Sleepy" Burke, the former burglar,
who now lives in New York, presented
a strange- spectacle on the witness
stand. Hp was well dressed and pros
perous looking, but his testimony was
given in a halting manner. He is
afflicted with St. Vitus' dance, and his
features became strongly contorted and
often he was unable to continue, during
which time the proceedings had to be
stopped.
Ex-Chief of Police Badenoch was on
hand to testify, as were numerous other
witnesses.
The stolen bonds were presented in
evidence by the State, many of them
being dirty and greasy from their long
hiding in ash cans and under the coun
ters of saloons.
DROWNED MEN
With Good Boots on Not Found
Every Day.
"Good strong pair of boots you've got
there," remarked the longshoreman to
the ferry hand, as they stood half-way
up to their knees in slush.
"Yep," assented the other, looking com
placently down at his feet. "You're right;
they're good boots. Best I ever had. Got
'em" off a drowned man that I picked up
last summer."
His friend expressed no surprise, mere
ly observing that it was "lucky they were
a" fit."
"Oh, as far as that goes." said the ferry
hand in a spirit of cheerful economy,
"anything that I don't have to pay for is
a good fit for me."
"Well. I've had bad luck with boots.
said the longshoreman, gloomily. "Last
pair I had got so poor lookin' in a little
while that I had ter sell 'em to a blind
man up on Broadway. Wish I could
come across a pair like yours. "
"Well, drowned men with good rubber
boots of> ain't found every day," said the
ferry hand, grinniner: "but ef I see any
more comin" my way I'll save 'em for
yer Jack. So long." and in response to
the starter's whistle he slammed the
gate merrily in front of two trucks, to the
eloquent wVath of their drivers.â New

THE POLICE
NOT LIKELY
TO INTERFERE
Chief Devery Has a Change
of Heart at the Last
Moment.
Dispatch t . The i\v.i.
NEW YORK, June There is now
little doubt that Fttzslmmons and Jef
fries will light to a finish to-morrow
right at the Coney Island Athletic Club,
and that lovers of sport will see the
great heavyweight battle. The marked
(change in the attitude of Chief of Police
Devery, which was foreshadowed in to
day's Call, became more apparent this
afternoon and It is now most probable
that the police will be able to watch
,V c bout at Coney Island with the same
"y. ijuanimity which marked their view of
the several heavyweight finish fights
fit the Lenox and Broadway Athletic
ciubs quite recently.
And, barring the police, evidence mul
tiplies that the fight will be a fair en
counter from all standpoints. Outside
of the purse being divided, as it may
be in one proposition or another, Fitz
simmons has a reputation to hold or to
lose, and thai reputation is his for
tune. The Californian. too. has a for
tune to win if he beats Fitzsimmons
and. more than that, Julian and Brady
must keep faith with the public, which
has bought nearly $30,000 worth of seats
lin advance, or all. ii looks promising
Thus, all in all. it looks promising
from the standpoint of the ring patron.
From early morning a more confident
tone was noticeable among sporting
men generally. The uncertainty fol
lowing Devery's stiff announcement of
his intention to stop the fight if there
was a knockdown or a hard blow waned
hour by hour until â¢ -night the men
who will thmng the ringside expressed
The utmost confidence in the managers'
ability to pull oft" the bout without
trouble. The worst that they feared was
that the Chief of Police would attempt
to make gocd his threat, not by stop
ping the contest in the first or one of
the early rounds, but perhaps after one
of the contestants had become groggy
and without wail for an absolute
. knockout. But Chief Devery himself,
discussing the matter to-day, acknowl
edged that a knockout was probable
and vhat it might occur before inter
ference was possible. And. any way. it
is clear that if one of the big fellows
has the other gome the swing of a list
rr.ay finish it all before the police can
move hand or foot.
Betting showed a marked Impetus to
day, and the arrival of sporting' men
from the South and West lent an air
of great activity to the resorts in
Broadway. If thing, Fitzsimmons
went back somewhat in the betting,
but while some professional experts
â were quick to say that they thought
2 to 1 a false price, the shman
was clearly the favorite and will go
into the ring quoted at about that fig
ure.
Referee Siler. Jeffries. Fitzsimmons.
Brady and Julian will meet at the
Coney Island Cl'ih to-morrow after
noon and go over the rules in detail.
In Order to avoid all possible misunder
standing when the men begin mixing it
up. As th.- referee's talk with the prin- !
clpals on Wednesday showed, there was
no important point of difference In their
interpretation of the conditions agreed
upon, and it is probable the conference
will be marked by smooth sailing.
There was great confidence in both
camps to-day, such confidence as one
used to hear of in the days just before
some opponent of the great Sullivan
went into the ring weighted down with
a fortune in backing and lost, like his
* predecessors. Men talked in one
I.reath to-day of Fitzsimmons' age and
Jfffries' youth and strength, and in the
next of 'Fitzsimmons' skill as a ring
general and hitter and of Jeffries' in
experience. Thf-se were the principal
things they talked about in arguing
over the fighters' chances.
The change in the attitude of the
Police Department was generally cred
ited to the interference of Hugh Me
-1 aughlin Brooklyn's boss, in behalf of
the Coney Island Club. It was gossip
that he had been appealed to. and that
he in turn, had used his influence with
high Manhattan Democrats to call off
the proposed interference, as was done
before when the Coney Island Club
sought a license. This explanation of
the case was denied most emphatically
by-Chief Devery. and in denying it he
-aid some curious things, which tended
to show that a change had come over
thp spirit of his dream.
â I have nothing more to say about
the matter," he said, when asked if his
I attitude was the same as it was on
Wednesday.
When asked about the report that
Mcl aughlin's influence had caused an
alteration of his plans he said: "I will
gay Mr. McLaughlin has not interfered
in "this matter In any way."
'â¢ \nd his friends have not.
"His friends have done nothing. 1
"Then the situation is just the same
as it was on Wednesday?"
"About the same."
"About the same?"
"Yes." . - â,
"There will be no slugging, then?
"No slugging; certainly not."
"You will not allow a knockout?
w The Chief smiled wearily. "You can't
.* always prevent a knockout," he said.
"You see, a man might go out from
cheer weakness. In this hot weather a
man might be overcome and might fall
from a light blow or while making a
side step to get out of the way. The
heat might finish him."
"But these men are trained to the
hour."
"Yes but In such weather as this a
man might easily be overcome after
great exertion."
"Then it is just as you left it yes
terday?"
"Well, that's all I have to say about
it The law will be observed."
I Betting was lively in "Jim" Corbett's
place to-night and there was a big
.sporting "push" on hand. Corbett had
some interesting things to say when
asked about the fighters on the eve of
J "Where does Fitzsimmons come in to
have the betting two to one in his
favor?" he asked. "I call that a false
price Mind you. he is an aggressive
I lighter and can take punishment and
wait his chances, but this Jeffries is
very big and he's aggressive, too. it
wouldn't surprise me a great deal if
mmons won in a round, but then,
why shouldn't the other fellow do the
name? Of course Fitzsimmons has an
advantage in his experience. He will
go coolly to work. The other man may
have a bit of a stage fright at first.
but if he stays a few rounds he will
b" more at ease and then he may jus
tify nil that has been said of him.
VVitzsimmons is not the crafty man they
Aiay he is. I hit him more easily than
I hit several other men I've fought.

The writer may be wrong; he has erred
before in his prognostications] yet he does
not accord the Los Angeles boiler maker
so much as a look in at Coney Island.
This deduction has no basic prejudiced
The conclusion thai Fitzsimm ms cannot
lose and i hat Jeffries cannot win is born
of as strong a "form" line as ever in
duced a handicapper in the assignment of
weights. This, too after due allowance
is made for weight, height, age and other
natural advantages.
Fiizsimmons may have gone back: Jef
fries possibly has come forward. There
is no possible ratio, however, by which
one could have overcome the other. In
other words, Fitzsimmons cannot possi
bly have gone back far enough to meet
the oncoming strides of Jeffries. The
writer will be frank enough to admit he :
has seen the boiler maker in action but i
once. Then it was in a friendly combat
with his sparring partner, but it sufficed
to demonstrate that the Los Angeles man
is both shoulder and muscle bound Fair
ly ileet of foot for one of his weight, he
was. nevertheless, painfully slow with his
arms and practically bereft of a straight
hitting left. A man who swishes his right
and left bout in windmill fashion has
little or no chance against a lignter of the
Fitzsimmi school. Fitzsimmons never
gets far enough away from his man to
permit of the effective landing of a swing
ing blow. It would take an adept at the
short-range game to encompass tne down
fall of the red-headed man from Cornwall. :
A few of Jeffries' rights, which Indicate
how futile his ehiJKri *to championship is,
are here apjH-i^gf.
Knocked out (P"v.r> Baker, nine round?
I 'raw with â ;â !> Ruhlii twenty rounds.
Draw with Joe Choynski, twenty rounds
\\ on from Tom .Sharkey. twenty rounds.
Won from Bob Armstrong, ten rounds.
Of these five contests four of them
make Fitzsimmons what should be a sure
winner. A fighter who in the prime of his
pugilistic career allows poor, asthmatic
Henry Baker to remain on his pins twen
ty-seven minutes cannot lick Tommy
Kyan. tor the welterweight champion dis
posed of the same job in two rounds,
while Dick Moore, who recently lost in
two rounds to Jack Root, won from Baker
on a knockout in seven rounds.
Take the twenty-round draw with Gus !
Ruhlin. for example, as a line. Poor, de
crepit Yank Kenney I eat Ruhlin in six
teen rounds. Yet nobody will argue that
Kenney has a ghost of a chance with
Fitzsimmons. Again, Bob Armstrong
whipped Kenney. Armstrong was twice
whipped by Childs, a cheap third-rater
and Byers, a mediocre middleweight, beat
Childs to pulp. Once again it was all Ruh
lin could do to win over Steve O'Donnell
in twenty rounds (mind you, Ruhlin
fought a draw with Jeffries). and every
body knows that on two occasions Peter
Maher disposed of Steve O'Donnell. prac
tically In as many punches. Fitzsimmons
licked Maher once in twelve rounds and
again in a minute and twenty-five sec
onds.
Jeffries drew with Joe Choynski In
twenty rounds about eighteen months ago.
This after Joe had begun his descent of
the pugilistic ladder, without referring to
the engagement between Fitzslmmons and
Choynski. which was interfered with by
the police in the fifth round for the good
and sufficient reason that the Californian
was in danger of being killed at the hands
of Fitzsimmons. and which performance
is therefore a bit clouded. For form pur
poses take Choynski's fight with Peter
Maher. The Irishman knocked the He
brew out in six rounds.
Is It necessary to revert again to
Manor's two disastrous engagements with
Immons?
In a hairbreadth finish Jim Jeffries
gained a decision over Tom Sharkey in
twenty rounds of milling. No matter
what the records say nor yet what in
duced Wyatt Earp to render a contrary
decision, Tom Sharkey was completely,
decisively and cleverly whipped by Fitz
simmons in eight rounds.
Jeffries' last performance in the ring
(hi.- light with Bob Armstrong) is another
black spot in his record. There is nothing
in this to entitle Jeffrie? to any serious
consideration. He engaged to knock Arm
strong out in ten rounds and failed. Ex
perts who saw this contest contend if
there was such a thing as a "shade"
either way it was in favor of the big
black.
There is nothing to Indicate that the
battle of to-morrow night will not be an
honest one. If a coup was in view the
returns would come most heavily on the
defeat of Fitzsimmons. With George Siler
In the ring Fitzsimmons would have to be
a party to the "throw-down." This is im
probable. It Is not Impossible, however.
Fitzsimmons' self-confessed fake with Jim
Hall will ever stand out as a menace to
speculators who fancy his chances but are
fearful of his honesty.
l for one shall ever esteem the integrity
of to-morrow night's battle as assailable
should Jeffries win.
M. L. HOUSEMAN.
The only direct wire com
ing to any newspaper on

The story will be told by

fistic expert in the country.
I assured him I wouldn't hurt him.
We I, I guve him an opening after
awhile and hÂ«- pave me a thump on the
jaw which dazed me. I didn't let him
know it. I was shifty until I felt all
right again. That's where experience
comes in, and that's when- Fitzsim
mons has an advantage over Jeffries.
But Jeffries is a giant, and I can't see
how two to one is a right price.
"Most of the men who've been in my

matter most of th>-m say so simply ;*s
a man who doesn't know horsea will

knowledge which is admirable Is that

tlies.- men would divide the purse.
There was talk of that, and I simply
argued that even if tne purse were di
vided before the fight the contest would
nevertheless be "on the level,' because
the winner would get the big end of it

FIGHTING
MACHINE
Special r'isrntrJi to The Call.
NEW YORK, June 8. â Charley White,
one of the most capable and popular
referees that ever stepped ii.to a ring,
and who has been identified with pugil
ism for many years, having trained and
handled such mÂ«n as Bob Fitzsimmons,
Jim Ccrbett, Kid McCoy and Tommy
Ryan, had this to say to-day regarding
the abilities of Fitzsimmons and Jef
fries:
In tnv opinion Fitzsimmons is one of
the marvels of the fighting world and has
no pe<*r as an athlete in that particular
line. He has an advantage which no other
fighter possesses, :hat of having his
weight above the hips. He carries his
driving power directly behind his shoul
(iet blades, wl Ich la the Becrel of his great
bitting. He has, with his great length of
reach, a remarkable fur. -arm. two of the
! . .-: hands ever givan to a fighter and an
extraordinary knowledge of how to use
them. He can deliver a blow from any
1,1 sitlton of his. body. He has a variety
oi blows which, delivered from any posi
tic n. are knock-out o:i< s if landed. He is
the most tricky man .vith his feet and his
\>y>. which arc small. Fitz is also a cool,
calculating lighter and has an active
brain. He can see advantages quicker
than most men can. arid he has. the knack
of trying In one round what he Intends to
dv a few rounds later, such as some little
feint or sidestep, which is only a "feeler 1
for a heavy fusillade of blows later on.
Ho never becomes disheartened, never
takes his eyes oil '-.is opponent while In
the ring, and is alw.t. weaving in and out
looking for an opportunity to get in a
knock-out Mow.
Jeffries is an unknown quality in the
pugilistic world to-day. The critics are all
at sea as to his abilities. He is just the
man to have a great chance to become the
n< xt champion. (>n account Of his im
mense bulk of weight, people would natur
ally think he was slow. On the contrary.
Ik- is a remarkably fast man for one of
bin build and physiaue. He is really no
i'<.vice. and he has had considerable ex
perience, having se i>red victories over
Joe Goddard and Peter Jackson. Any man
that can tight Tom Sharkey for twenty
rounds must be a gr-tt fighter. He is ten
\ â¢ ars younger than liif champion, has an
advantage of forty pounds in weight and
i< longer in the reach and taller. These
advantages to any man would be of biÂ«
).. cefli to him if they can be used prop
erly. He is thoroughly game, and should
i.. able to stand a great amount of pun
ishment.
Jeffries' showing at the Lenox Athletic
Club with Bob Armstrong should not be
taken a? a criterion of his form. I have
r. en him work better while helping to
train Corbett at Carson City. He has an
immense amount of strength, which will
bt- a great help to him in this fight. If he
has improved any it will make him a very
dangerous opponent, but he must have
speed. He has been carefully coached and
trained and can be depended on to go into
the ring In the best possible condition.
Jeffries in order to win will have to use
ell the advantages ne has at his com
niand.
The Call will be the only
paper on the Pacific Coast
which will have a direct
wire from the ringside at
the big fight this evening,.

FITZSIMMONS'
WIFE TO SEE
THE BATTLE
Special T>iFr >f it' n h to The Call.
NEW YORK. June S.â Mrs. Robert
Fftzstmmone is building her hopes upon
seeing her husband tight Jeffries from a
secluded balcony. The woman who sat
by the ringside at Carson and cheered
her husband on to the world* champion
ship has determined to see him defend his
title. Though women are excluded from
the fight on Friday night, a woman's ac
umen will in all probability set at naught
the well laid plans of the managers of
the fight.
Fitzsimmons is so confident of carrying
off the honors that he does not mind his
wife's presence in the least, but Billy
Brady doesn't think it the proper thing.
However, the champion has something to
say in the matter, and Mrs. Fitzsimmons
may, after all, witness the great con
test.
At Carson City women were admitted to
seats near the arena, and several of the
fair sex were among the spectators. Mrs.
Fitzsimmons does not see any harm In
watching her husband in battle. She does
not wish to bo at the ringside to advise
him, as has been reported. It has been
suggested that a balcony be erected in a
secluded purt of the building, where she
jean look on without attraction attention^

JEFFRIES
CONFIDENT
OF SUCCESS
Special Dispatch to The Call.
ASBX'RY PARK. N. J.. June S.â His last
day before the fight found Jeffries on a
keen edge, as his trainers expressed it,
and they said they had no apprehension
as to the outcome of itie battle. Over and
over again to-day, in answer to ques
tlcns, "Billy" Delaney said: "How can
he lose when he has youth, strength and
science? With these elements he will
win."
It was us hot as ever to-day, and the
effects of the weather were felt keenly at
Jeffries' camp. The big boiler-maker was
satisfied with an hour's -work this morn
ing At 3 o'clock in the afternoon he took
a sea bath, and on returning to his train
ing quarters lay down in a hammock and
siept for an hour or more. He woke up
feeling much refreshed. When r> o'clock
came. Jeffries, his brother Jack and Koss
O'Neill went out for some road exercise.
The sky was partly clouded and the heat
was not as severe as it had been earlier
i-i the day.
"J< ft" jogged almost four miles. Re
turning home he indulged in several
sprints, and O'Neill and brother "Jack"
Jeffries on their bicycles were obliged to
pedal hard to keep even with him. After
a rub-down Jeff ate a hearty supper and
was ready for bed at 9 o'clock.
George Siler. who will referee the con
test, was a visitor at Jeffries' camp this
afternoon anrl remained until 4 o'clock.
Siler was accompanied by his wife. De
laney and Siler talked over old tim<s. and
comparatively little was said about to
morrow's light. Siler had visited Fiu-
BimmonÃ, and he said he thought he ought
to call on J> ffritH. Mrs. Siler is a firm
believer in Jeffries' ability to whip Fitz
simmons, and she has bet a pair of gloveu
on the result. When word was received
from N>w York this afternoon that nearly
all the seats had been sold there was con
siderable joy in Jeffries' camp. It has
been settled that the party will leave As
bury Park to-morrow morning at ten
minutes past 9 o'clock. At Jersey City
they will be met by Rrady and will go
immediately to Coney Island. Many
w.uild think that on the eve of such ah
important fight Jeffries would be more or
!<-hs nervous and >-xeited. He is calm and
self-possessed. He will say little about the
fight, although It is clear that he is do
ing a lot of thinking.
The Call's bulletin board
will tell the story of the
fight between Fitzsimmons
and Jeffries. The only
direct wire from the ring
side and the best expert
writer on pugilism will give
the news ahead of and
better than any competi
tor.
"I think." said Mrs. Fitzsimmons to
day, "that my husband will win in a
few rounds, and that there, will be no
brutality displayed in the contest. I have
often seen more brutal exhibitions in the
street that have ever taken place in the
ring. Women attend boxing exhibitions
given by our athletic clubs, and I can see
no difference in exhibitions held else
where when they are decided under the
,satug rule*." ,

IS A WINNER
Sees the Champion Work
and Note 3No Reversal
in Form.
BY KID McGOY.
NEW YORK, June B.â On reaching
"Bob" Fitzslmmons' home this afternoon
I found the champion reclining- quietly in
bed. with apparently not the least thought
of the great battle so close at hand. There
was no trace of fear or worry in his
countenance, and to my hurried glance \
he looked the picture of health and confi- j
dence.
"Fitz," I said, "you seem to be worried
to death."
"Yes, I am," he replied, with a negative
smile.
"How are you feeling?" I queried, after
an exchange of greetings.
"I could not wish to be more contented
and never felt better in my life." â 
Then in came Mrs. Fitzsimmons, all
smiles and as pleasant as though Bob
had the long end of the purse already in
his pocket. Continuing. Bob said:
"This is to be my last fight if I win. I
have not thought of losing. Should that
be the case it will, of course, make a
difference; but I have truly never given
the idea of defeat a thought. I do not see
how I can miss Jeffries, he is so big. I
do not think his weight will have time to
tell in this battle."
Fitz said that he weighed 157 pounds.
"What are your intentions in case you
win?" I asked.
"I think I will go to Australia and see
my dear mother. Father died recently,
and she certainly feels lonely. I will not
remain away from the United States long.
as 1 must get back and earn some money.
You know that 1 am under big expenses
and cannot afford to remain idle very
long. 1 am getting along in years and
want to quit the ring without being de
feated. I have fought and defeated everj .
man they have put against me. and I have
conceded weight to tnem all.
Warming, the champion vouchsafed the
following advice: "Now, Kid, take my
advice and get a clear title to the mid
ale-weight championship hrst, and then
when you get stronger you can tackle
lh "YeL Bob?'that is my plan." 1 replied.
"I have just deposited $lUÂ«J with George
Siler as a forfeit in support of ,my chal
lenge to fight you for the middle-weight
title apart from the result of the battle
W "Welf," was the reply. "I may give you
the chance when I return from Australia.
I do not like to leave the ring when there
are such big purses In sight.
"The Colorado Athletic Association has
offered a purse of $25,000 for you and me,
the tight to take place in Denver inside of
six months," 1 suggested. ..
Mrs Fitzsimmons here said: 'I would
not like to see you get beaten. Mr. Me- ;
Coy, but that is what Bob would have to
do if you fought him. You lived with us:
when you were a little boy. and I always
thought so much of you. but, oh: how
you have grown. Just look, you are al-
Tsafd Hwo a ulKk'e to meet Bob before
he is too old, and that it was only a mat
ter of business with me. 1 added that I
was surprised to Â«c Bob i*>uvaiÂ»g â -â ' Â»prj
and young, and that he looked as thou^n
he was destined to be a young fellow tor
ten years vet. The hostler then put in
an appearance and announced that the
"Skrun 8 Julian took the ribbons, whilo

the scene of the impending battle. 1- it/,
is a popular hero. A large crowd was in
our wake the whole journey, but only the
champion and his party were admitted to
the clubhouse. Proceeding to the dress
ing room Bob prepared for a bout with
his partner, "Yank" Kenney. Bob
wanted to test the ring and his footing.
The pair put on the gloves, while Julian
held the watch, and they went at it.
Whoever labors under the impression
that Fitz has lost . any of his old-time
dash and cleverness is wrong. "Bob held
himself and boxed with all his old-time
form, as 1 so well remember it, and
which has brought the money home in all
his contests. Three lively rounds ana
Kenney was done, while Bob had hardly
got up a sweat. He went to the dressing
room, where Jack Everhardt and Dan
Hickey gave him the usual rub, and then
a bucket of cold water and another brisk
rub. We walked to a hotel a short dis
tance from the club, where a crowd gave
the champion a great reception, which he
acknowledged by raising his hat. As we
drove away the crowd had increased to
Bee the greatest fistic hero of the day,
and cheered as though he had just won.
1 made a careful study of Bob Fitzsim
mons the whole time I was with him, and
in all sincerity I hold the opinion that he
will win to-morrow night, with all due
regard for the capabilities of Jim Jeffries.
After calling on Fitz to-day I was in
troduced to Jim Jeffries, but I could not
have much talk with him by reason of
the many visitors at bis quarters.
The most prominent was George Siler.
Who will referee the light. I paid special
attention to Jeffries' manners, and I must
admit a favorable impression at first
sight. He is a tine, strapping, lively
locking fellow and is in the best possible
condition, in my opinion. He is particu
larly confident, too, as are all in his camp.
He refrained from any work while I was
present, and I am inclined to think that
he has finished all preparations and is
now waiting his meeting with Fitzsim
mons, with an inborn confidence of being
returned a sure winner.
For a man of his size he is remarkably
quick and active, and apart from the out
come of his battle with Fitzsimmons, I am
certain that the sturdy and ambitious
CaHfornian* will cut mite a figure in the
pugilistic world in the time to come. I
am reluctant to give my opinion about
Jeffries' chances, but am induced to be
sincere with the public and say that 1
think he will suffer defeat at the hands
of Fitz to-night.
HEAVY WAGERING HERE.
Nearly One Hundred Thousand Dol
lars Will Change Hands on the
Outcome of the Fight.
The meeting of Fitzsimmons and Jef
fries in the Coney Island Athletic
Club ring for the championship of
the world seemed the sole topic of oon
venatioa on the street last night. Not
withstanding all the discussion, the sup
porters of each man remain steadfast in
their opinions and refuse to have tluir
faith shaken. This is reflected in the
betting, the odds remaining unchanged
throughout the day.
The small bettors pin their faith to the
Californian. the bulk of the wagering on
Jeffries being in small amounts. Fitz
simmons, on the other hand. Is being
backed chiefly by the men who buy thrir
tickets in bunches, few of the Individual
bets being under $100. It does not follow
that all the big bettors favor the Cor
nishman. Johnny Coleman. the book
maker, bet $700 against $1000, taking tiie
Jeffries end.
The betting was steady at Corbett's all
the evening. In the parts mutuels a total
of 2234 dollar tickets had been sold.
Fitzsimmons was favorite on all but two
lines. On one of these Jeffries found one
more supporter than Fitzsimmons did.

ARE TRAINED
TO THE HOUR
There Will Not Be Such a
Vast Disparity in Weight
Either.
Sr^cia! Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK. June 8. â To-morrow
night, between 9 and 10 o'clock. Robert
Fitzsimmons, champion pugilist of the
world, and James Jeffries, the gigantic
Californian, will meet in the ring of
the Coney Island Sporting: Club and set
tle their differences according to Mar
quis of Queensberry rules.
In spite of the taik that the battle
will be stopped by Chief of Police Dev
ery, it was confidently asserted to-day
by some of the big guns In Brooklyn
political matters that Referee Siler
would be the only official to put a stop
to it. As the Brooklynites all say:
"We do not interfere with Tim Sulli
van's boxing clubs in New York, con
sequently we demand similar rights
and privileges. If ( 'hief Devery lets
rights proceed unmolested at the Lenox
and Broadway dubs, there is no good
reason why he should not follow the
same policy toward the Coney Island
Club, which has complied with the re
quirements of the law and is in just as
good standing as any other boxing club
in the State."
With confidence expressed that there
will be no interference with the mill,
the army of sporting men naturally
have turned their attention to the prin
cipals, who have trained well and faith
fully. To most men it looks like a vic
tory for Fitzsimmons, chiefly because
of his wonderful record in the*ring, and
especially since coming to this country
from the Antipodes.
The fact that Fitz has won most of
his fights, too, with one terrilic punch
landed on a vital spot is not overlooked.
The champion is much older than Jef
fries, and will enter the ring at least
thirty-five pounds lighter. Jeffries will
tip the sca^ at about pounds, which
is the lowest he has trained to in his
career.
In spite of the talk that Fitzsimmons
will be over 158 pounds, it is learned
from a must trustworthy source that
when the champion got upon the scales
on Wednesday he weighed 170% pounds.
He has been building himself up in
training, and yet he is not the posses
sor of surplus fat. In fact, there is
not an ounce of flesh in his magnificent
physique which is superfluous, for
he has made himself as hard as nails,
and at the same- Tim- has retained the
speed and hitting power which have
made him the conqueror he is. In con
dition, therefore, Fitzsimmons is rug
ged, powerful, fast and capable of
standing any roughing he may receive
from his ponderous antagonist. He is
confident he will win quickly, and by
no fluke. Fitzsimmons d >es not say
h'-"- hv inf-ii-i.- to right jenxies, despite
statements to the contrary, nut he has
done no end of experimenting with big
Kenney, his sparring partner, who is
almost as weighty as Jeffries.
Fitzsimmons has no equal as a ring
general and schemer. He is quick
witted, -shrewd and full of tricks. For
this reason, Jeffries will have to fight
him warily until he believes he has the
Cornishman's measure. Fitzsimmons
has never faced a man of Jeffries' build
and makeup. He has in the past had
th- advantage with his phenomenal
reach, but in this instance he is out
classed. Jeffries has such a tremend
ous reach it .will not be at all surpris
ing to see him fight Fitzsimmons with
left hand Jabs from the start, reserv
ing right hand swings until later on.
The boilermaker has been practicing
defensive tactics more than attack, and
believes he can keep Fitzsimmons off.
The latter is expected to force the
fighting from the start. In such an
event it is believed Jeffries wili stand
away and try to "jab his block off."
as the talent puts it. If successful in
this method for half a dozen rounds or
80, it is thought in the Jeffries camp
he will have a fine chance to win, as
his strength and stamina are expected
to assist him wonderfully.
If, on the other hand. Jeffries should
decide to rush at once and mix it. it
is the impression among critics that
Fitzsimmons will get a chance to land
one of his deadly hooks, all of which,
in recent fights, have been delivered at
short range. Jeffries not only stood
the very aggressive Shnrkey off in
twenty rounds, but also beat him on
points. This achievement is the basis

How to Fill a Lamp.
An excellent point in connection with
the refilling of an oil lamp is furnished
py a lamp salesman. Practically all the
kerosene lamps on the market to-day
have â¢packed" reservoirs, that I?, oil re
ceptacles packed with cotton! When fill
ing a lamp it is best to turn the wick up
so that nearly all of it is above the
burner and not turn it down again until
arter tne wick and burner section have
been screwed Into the body of the lamp
The reason for this is that if the longer
part of the wick is shoved into the reser
voir so as to come into contact with the
cotton filling, and then the burner top is
screwed down into place, the cotton is a;>t
to become twisted about the wick, so that
it is ineffectual, because of the cotton ac
crued in the cours.. of the wick's turning

Many persons, according to reports re

came.
The situation at Manardville is even
more serious. A small town located to

prey to the rasing torrents. Seventeen

there and there may be others. Of |
those drowned, two were young white i

The ( thers were all negroes, who were j
living in cabins close to the river front
and were caught in the Hood before
they could make their way to safety,
owing- to thÂ«- darkness of the night.

TROUBLES OF THE RICH
Extremes to Which the Swells Are
Driven for Novelty.
Tho power to possess that which any
one else has nr may have is not satisfy
ing even to the multi-millionaire, who has
but to sign his name to a check and call
thi treasures of the world at his com
mand. After the tirst expert* nee of new
ly acquired wealth there comes satietyâ
' â¢ which attacks with subtle under
force the castle of contentment
and makes novelty appear a more desir
able prize than the accumulated Indlca
money's power, as exemplified in
his art treasures, his g irgeous raiment
uid his rare entertainments.
Otl ts ar< able to secure the gold just
as much as he possesses, for what money
, has bought money may buy. but the vein
riginallty, the peculiar out-of-the-or
; dinary quality is what it cannot achieve
iul the aid of mental force directed
in new lines of thought. Thus the mil-
Ire, having run the gamut of gorge
ness and exclusiveness, Bighs for some
thing absolutely novel, and In his desire
for such goes to extremes that make tho
hoi pollol gasp and the average mortal
have doubts of his sanity.
Th( latest ebullition prompted by this
cr LYing Is tho society Cakewalk. Years
the fantastic steps, the physical py
ratlons and the conscious smirk were
oevi r s< en beyond the environment of the
plantation. Dusky belles and tin ir part
ners walked for th.- cake in the true"st
spirit 'if competition and little dreamed
that later on the stage would give their
diversion Its recognition which to-day
ty encores and in which it partici
pates.
: The fair-skinned damesls of the four
Ired have nrou.iint their superior in
â  ipon this form of en
tertainment and the steps taken in a
Louis Quatorze ballroom are much more
Intricate and graceful than those that
were wonl to win applause In a lo^- cabin
in the "quarters." The vaudeville show
brought Into the homes of the wealthy is
also an Indication of this zest for the'un
;. while to eai beefsteak in one's fin
grimy dungeon pleases society's
for the momr-nt far more than to 'sit
down i" the most daintily appointed ta
ble. "Novelty, novelty, give us novelty."
Is the cry, and whether in securing it the
votaries of excitement are called upon to
le the slums or wrest the honors
from the cheapest song and dance artists
matters not, so long as the new not is
struck, without which the harmonies of a
! millionaire's life are- to him dull and tune
( less.
Blankets on the Outer Wall.
Probably in no other civilized city of
the world do people air their bedding and
table linen out of the front windows as
| they do in Chicago. Not so much is this
barbarous custom practiced in the resl
â¢!. nee part of the city as It is down town,
I and the nearer to the center of the city
i one gets the more bedding he sees hanging
\ from the windows. Along Wabash avenue,
: beginning at Harrison street, blankets,
sheets, bed quilts, pillows and even the
â  mattresses are hung out, held securely to
the window sill by having {he sash pulled
down hard on top of them.
Along Washington street the blankets
and other bedding wave Jauntily, to the
I brpf-ze, and on the day of the great jubl
lee parade an extra quantity seemed to
! have been put forth. Sometimes a sheet
or blanket will fall to the street below,
enveloping some pedestrian in its folds
and furnishing amusement for the crowds
I of people who are always on the street,
and they .stand about and laugh until the
, owner of the piece of bedding comes
| laughingly forward and rescues It from
the person in whose hands it has fallen.
Tobacco Exports to Japan.
"In the part of North Carolina I live
in," remarked a man from that State re
cently, "the thirst bright tobacco In the

England and some to Australia. The

Wanted Heavier Revolvers.
After the capture of Suakim it was al
leged In the House of Commons that the
lances served out were totally unfit for
use, bending directly they were put to
the trial. And now, as the result of the
experience of the recent campaign, the
Mauser revolver is being severely criti
cized. Other declare that in many cases
the revolver was absolutely useless, and
rather than lean on a broken reed they
preferred to discard the pistol altogether,
for it is a serious affair to discover that
you have been relying upon a weapon
which is useless for its purpose. The same
verdict comes from the northwest fron
tier of India. What seems to be wanted
is an effective "man-stopping" revolver
which will stand the test of a campaign.
It Is suggested that too much has been
sacrificed for the sake of lightness. Of
course weight is an important considera
tion, but officers would not mind a little
heavier pistol, provided it was additional
ly reliable.â Naval and Military Record.

DEFENDANT LEE
TELLS HIS STORY
Says He Did Not Slay
the Fountains.
HIS OWN LIFE THREATENED
MOB VIOLENCE ADVOCATED AND
SHOTS FIRED AT HIM.
The Accused Calmly Narrates the Pur
suit of Officers and Admits
That He Killed One of
Them, Kearney.
Fr>eelal Dlaratch to The Call.
HTLLSBORO, N. Mex.. June B.â The de
fens* in the Fountain murder trial
strengthened the alibi this morning, when
Albert Blevin, a Texas and Pacific fire
man, who worked near Dog Canyon, testi
fied that he was with Lee and' Gi'lliland
at Lee's ranch, sixty miles from the mur
der scene, during the very time Colonel
Fountain and his son are said to have
been killed. Blevin arrived there ai 1'
p. m. on Saturday. February 1, and re
mained until Monday. Maxwell was also
there. The latter had said the defendants
were not there. The witness also said
the cattle the prosecution claimed to have
been used to obliterate the trails were
under contract to be delivered and that
I>ee was with him the day he met the
herd. He refuted the statements of sus
picious actions in the presence of the
searchers.
The prosecution held the witness nearly
three hours, vainly trying to confuse him.
The defense has discharged half its wit
nesses, as they are not considered neces
sary.
Mrs. Lee, the widowed mother of the
defendant Lee, told a straightforward
story of the presence of her son at the
home at the time Colonel Fountain and
his son are supposed to have been mur
dered.
Oliver Lee repeated the defense's story
of his whereabout* at that time and said
that he ilrst heard he was Buspected sev
eral days later. He than went to Las
Cruces and found a warrant had been
Issued. He offered to surrender and stand
trial then but was refused. An extra
issue of a Las Cruces paper suggested
mob law and openly accused him of the
Fountain murder. He learned that a posse
was searching for him and that among
its members was Ben Williams, who was
said to have a mania -jfor murder, and
others known to X- his jflien^ifs. Then he
returned to his ranclv ,/'
The prosecution objected to the intro
duction of the newspaper as evidence. In
the argument Attorney Fall said he could
print to the man who wrote the article,
and he was not the editor. The prosecu
tion contended that newspaper editorials
ere simply statements of editors and not
public opinion. The court admitted the
comments, but no statements of alleged
facts.
Continuing, the witness said that, fear
ing the officers would kill him. with a
warrant as an excuse, he hurried home,
but visited Las Cruces several times
afterward and learned the warrant had
been withdrawn. The matter was espe
cially rife at election lime. When the last
warrant was issued he did not surrender
b< cause of mob talk and of information
that certain persons had said they would
do him violence if he fame in. Subse
quently he agreed with Judge Parker, who
is now trying the case, to surrender on
condition that he be not committed to
jail, and did so. Regarding the killing of
Deputy Kearney last July, he saiij he
slept on the roof because he feared he
would be killed by threatening parties.
"I was fired upon when asleep." said the
witness. "Kearney fired twice and <iar
rett also fired before I fired, r heard no
command of hands up, but Oarrett was
talking while shooting. I killed Kearney.

in other means that is no argument against it, for nine out of ten of its cures were made
after all else had failed. It pours vitality into the nerves and muscles, restoring the
wasted power, and it must cure.

EXCAVATORS BURIED
BY BIG LANDSLIDE.
Twenty-Eight Railroad Laborers
filled in ar> Arkansas
Disaster.
LITTLE ROCK, Ark., June B.â It is reported here to-night that a
landslide occurred at Ross Hollow and engulfed twenty-eight men, all of
whom are supposed to have been killed. Ross Hollow is a pass between
two small mountain ranges, about twenty-eight miles west of Little
Rock, on the line of the Choctaw and Memphis Railway, now undor con
struction from Little Rock to Howtit. A large force cf graders has been
engaged in grading the road through the pass, and. according to the re
port, it was a part of this force of men that were caught under the fall
ing earth.
The report cannot be confirmed to-night. None of the officials of the
road nor any of the contractors who are at present in this city have re
ceived news of the accident. The report was brought in by farmers
traveling from the locality. The scene of the accident is twenty-eight
miles from here, over a rough stretch of country, and it is impossible to
get news from there to-night. According to the farmers bringing the
news a large force of men were engaged in excavating in a deep cut,
when the earth above, which had been loosened by heavy rain, suddenly
came down upon them, burying twenty-eight men in tons of earth.
"We took care of him and made him as
rcmfortable as possible while dying. I
made Garrett's party ride away, but
agreed to surrender on condition that he
would tell the truth. T was waiting for a
new Sheriff in Dona Ana County before
surrendering. We were at Dog- Canyon al
most every day after Fountain's disap
pearance, and no one sought us there."
Lee was still on the stand when a recess

NO DANGER OF THE PLAGUE.
The Disease Cannot Thrive in the
United States.
WASHINGTON, June R.â The spread of
the. bubonic plague throughout the far
East and the fact that it is attacking Ku
rcpe, has caused considerable comment in
medical circles here. Surgeon General
W. K. Van Reypen of the navy is an au
thority on this disease. In discussing the
probability of its reaching San Francisco,
he said:
"The climatic conditions of the United
States preclude the possibility of the
plague ever getting within this country.
It Is â¢â : disease peculiar to the Orient, and
seldom, if ever, attacks Europeans. The
bubonic plague with reference to the
United States Is like- beri beri. A Japa
nese vetasel once brought a number of
cases of this disease to New York. Those
afflicted were Isolated and soon recover* d.
M here is absolutely no danger of the
plague ever getting here."
The acting surgeon general of the army,
Colonel Charles H. Alden, said: '-The
Oi arantine service is <=<j^^ficie:it that the
bubonic plague could siof^fcobtain a foot
hold in the United States, even though the
conditions wore favorable. I don't know
of a single case of plague in the United
States. It is a disease which flourish! >
only where there is dirt and filth."
MUST WAIT FOR THE BADGER.
California Naval Militia Cannot
Cruise at Present.
WASHINGTON, June B.â Unless the
auxiliary cruiser Badger returns from Sa
moa within a short time, the practice
cruise of the California Naval Militia may
bo indefinitely delayed this year. Lieu
tenant W. H. 11. Southerland. in charge
of the naval militia of the various
States, said to-day that at the present
time there was no vessel on the Pacific
Coast which could be utitlized for tin's
cruise. No requests have been received
from the California Naval Militia to be
permitted to take their annual cruise, and
until the Hanger returns no action will
be taken by the Navy Department.
Lieutenant Southerland stated that he
was hopeful that the work of the Sa
moan Joint Hi.uti Commission would be
concluded ai an early date, and that Im
mediately upon the I the Badger

It would be Impossible, he stated, t<
another vessel from the Atlantic station

the naval militia to sea.
LARGER THAN MAMMOTH
CAVE OF KENTUCKY
Burial Cavern of the Maoris Found
by a Scientist In New
Zealand.
VICTORIA, ,Jun.> B.â The Mammoth)
Cave of Kentucky, which has held tha
record heretofore as the world's greatest
cav<rn, must hereafter give precedence
greater cave of New Zealand, dis
covered on the 27th of April by Horace
Johnstone near Port Waikato and but
ten or twelve miles from the city "f
Wellington. The cave is in limestone and
is supposed to be the gTeat burial cave of
the Maoris, described in all the legends of
that race. Johnstone's description of his
find upon his return to Wellington to re
plenish his stock of candles and guidance
< ord is very Interesting. He says:
"I had laid aside my scientific investi
gations for the nonce and taking my
gun, determined upon a day of unaJ
amusement, and I had just shot a j
which had fallen into a gully. i
lowed it and on the side of the hill 1 saw
a large opening some twenty feet wide by
about fifteen In height. The roof, E
should judge, is from 100 I ibove
the irregular floor. Procuring candles and
guidance cord to insure myself ag
being lost. 1 followed the main chamber
for a distance of two miles, at which
point it appeared to open rather than
contract. The roof there I could not see
it was lost in the shadows of my poor
candles. Midway between that point atvl
the entrance were numerous cvi
openings. I approached one. and. looking
in, saw amid the darkness white shining
columns, which glistened and shone as I
moved, whilst 1 could hear the drip, drip
of water in the distance.
"Oniighting wax matches and exploring
as far as my limited supply of light
would permit, I found innumerable col
umns of stalactiti s and stalagmites,show
ing every shade of color. The main cav
ern is undoubtedly miles in length. From
its burial urns and other evidenci
sepulture, I believe ir Is the great Maori
burial cave at last revealed."
A large exploration party has been or
ganized under Mr. Johnstone's direction
and was to have started for the cave on

THE PROPERTY FAMOUS
HOW A PHILADELPHIA BANK
BECAME INTERESTED.
i
I Comptroller of the Currency Refused
to Confirm the First Sale of the
Propertyâ A Very Low
Figure.
The Bunker Hill and Mayflower gold
mines in Amador County were sold at
, auction yesterday morning in front of the
I Appraiser's building by order of the ref
eree. The bidding started at $20,000 ami
the property was knocked down for $30,
--500 to c. R. Downs, representing a min
ing syndicate of Sutter Creek, Amador
County.
There is an interesting story connected
with the sale of this mining property.
The Bunker Hill is a famous mine, with
a record of producing $1,000,000. It was
; discovered In ISSO. In the process of mm]
] Ing developments all over this State, one
Bet of managers having control of the
! Hunker Hill, fancied that it would be a
â  good plan to permit Philadelphia capi
| talists to join in the work of bringing
I the treasure of the earth to the surface.
â  The suggestion was favorably received in
j the Quaker City and money to the amount
of $300,000 was advanced by the Spring
Garden National Bank of Philadelphia.
' The .Bunker Hill and Mayflower mines
| were taken by the bank to secure th
money loaned.
I Some years ago the Spring Garden Rank
suspended payment and the Comptroller
I of the Currency took charge of the institu
tion. A receiver was appointed and mea
sures were taken to convert the assets
, of the bank into cash to pay the deposi
. tors.
The receiver held undisputed possession
1 of the mining property tor six years. A
short time ago the property was sold for
i $20,000, but one of the depositors Mr.
Cheney, objected to the confirmation of
the sale on the ground that the mine was
1 worth more than that sum of money, and
the Comptroller refused to confirm the
i | transaction.
j The second sale was advertised in New
i i York. Boston.* Chicago, St. Louis Den
ver and San Francisco. "William A: Lam
t son of the Treasury Department was as-
M signed to the duty of conducting the pro
ceedings. To remove all doubts as to
i title the Treasury Department wired Mr.
Lamson as follows:
' . WASHINGTON, D. C, June 6. ISM.
William A. I^int-nn. San Francisco: The sale
i of the Hunker Hill and Mayflower mines, an
asset of the Spring Garden National, waj not

I was Inadequate. The title In the receiver, and
i ! which he will convey by quitclaim deed, has
â  never been attacked or even uueÃtloned either

DEATH CAME WHILE
HE WAS SLEEPING
James Scouler, Pioneer and One of
the Founders of St. Andrew's
Society, Is No More.
JAMBS SCOULER. a '49er and one of the founders of the Pi. Andrew's
Bociety, passed away at his home, 830 Vallejo strop), yesterday aftcr
nnnn. For a man of his years he had passed th< three score and ten
limit- in- enjoyed remarkably good health, ami yesterday morning went
'â â¢lit for his usual walk. He returned home aboul noontime and sat
down on tin- lounge and picked mi a paper i" read. When on- 1 of the
sons called at the hdiis>- to pay his customary Thursday visit to his father
ho found tho o!<1 gentleman with th> paper still in his hands, his glasses
in position on his nose, apparently asleep, (t was the sleep that knows no
waking. Without a struggle he had passed away.
James Scouler was born in Glasgow, Scotland, in 1824. and when 23 ypars
oi<i went to South America to seek his fortune. When gold was discovered
in California he was in Valparaiso, and from that place ho came to San
Francisco in the ship Cornelius Grinnell, arriving here in January, 1849. In
stead of going to the mines he wont to work for tho Pacific Mail <"ompany
anr] built the first offices tist d by that concern. After finishing that job he
went ;â â  the mines, but was one of the many who failed to find a fortune in
delving for gold. He came back to San Francisco and. in company with a
number of other disgusted miners, set up bachelor quarters on what is now
the corner of Stockton and Jackson streets.
In the summer of 1856 he went hack to Scotland, and on his return his
sister, now Mrs. A. Walcott, accompanied him. In September, 1%Â«, he. was
married to Miss .Lyiiia A. Wolfe, who survives him. He leaves four sons
and four daughters. Of the sons, James K. (Ralph) and Edwin are with
HirscJl & Kaiser; Benjamin is. with the Williams-Marvin Company and
Robert is with Pattosien & Co.
When the St. Andrew's Society was formed in San Francisco Mr. Scouler
became one of the charter members. He had been a regular attendant at the
Monday night meetings ever since, and in forty years he had not missed half
that number of regular sessions. lie will be buried next Sunday under the
auspices of the society.
! Llndley was there as counsel for the sue
, cessful bidder. Shalnwald <fc Buckbe*
1 managpd the transaction. The depositor
, who objected to the ronrirmatinn of the
â  sale for $20,000 was one of the bidders.
and his final offer for the property was
, $30,460. C. R. Downs, however, offered
$30,500. Here was a long pause, but no
other offers were made.
Mr. Downs, the successful bidder, was
the representative of several well-known
i mining men, among them ex-Senator E.
C. Voorheia and W. F. Detert.
The Bunker Hill mine is near Slitter
Creek, Amador County. The syndicate
purchasing the property is largely In

COURTS DEATH AGAIN.
Sing Lee Quong, a Murderous Chi
nese. Makes Another Attempt
at Suicide in His Cell.
Sing Lee Quong. a Chinaman confined
1 in the Broadway jail on a charge of as
sault to commit murder, attempted sui
j cide last night by hanging himself in his
; cell.
A few weeks ago Sing was arrested for
assaulting with a knife two Chinese un
dertakers who had given him a bed for
: the night in their office. Although the
' men were badly cut. both have recovered
, from the wounds inflicted by their mur
derous countryman.
The morning Sing was to appear In
' court two Chinese asked permission to
visit him. It was granted, and while the
| guard's bead was turned for a moment
I a small packet of "yen she," or opium
ashes, was passed to Sing. He swal
lowed about two ounces of the deadly
drug and was soon after hurried from
I the Police Court to the Receiving Hos
pital. After he had fully recovered from
the effects of the dose he stood his trial
and was sentenced to a term in the State
Prison. While awaiting transportation he
has been of a moody temperament, re
fusing to talk and feigning Bleep when
guard or visitors appeared.
. Last night the guard of the corridor in
' which he was held was aroused by a pro
longed tapping on the iron door of cell 3S.
He hurried to investigate, and found Sing
Lee Quong's crippled cellmate standing
I with his face pressed close against the
shutters. On being asked what was the
[ matter he said: "Sing been standing long
time in one place. Think sometings
i s'tnaFla." The door was immediately
opened, and it was found that Sing Lee
Quong had made a rope of his cardigan
jacket and a towel and hanged himself
from the top of the cell. Jailer Phillips
jat once cut him down. There was no
pulse noticeable and but a faint fluttering
of the heart. .Artificial respiration was
employed and Sing was soon found to be
out of danger.
The Chinese are known to be fatalists,
and in Chinatown it has often been said
that Sing would die by his own hand be
fore he would serve out his. term.

WAS WEARY OF THE
BURDEN OF LIFE
MRS. ALMA LINDO SWALLOWS
"ROUGH ON RATS."
Deserted by Her Husband, the Un
fortunate Woman Strives Hard
to End Her Existence.
Mrs. Alma Undo was taken from a
lodging house at Til Stockton Btreet yes
terday afternoon by Officer I. A. Peshi n
and sent to the Receiving Hospital to be
treated for poisoning:, "the woman had
while in a despondent state brought
about by the desertion of her huÂ«sl md
Bwallowed a quantity of "rough on rats "
Fortunately the landlady, Mrs. Mary
Kelly, was present when she attempted
to end her existence and grabbed the l><>.<
of poison away from her. Fearing that
Mrs. Lindo might die she notified the of
ticer and he hurriedly sent the woman to
the hospital. After her sufferings had
been relieved the unfortunate woman and
her two-year-old baby were taken in
charge by the matron, who did every
thing in her power- to soothe the patient.
It was learned that Mrs. Lindo is the
wife of Lawrence Lindo, who is employed
at the Popular restaurant. The couple
had been living together for th>' n,i~;
three years, and as a result a child was
bom in the hospital in which she had
hoped to die. About a month ap<> â¢..â¢â¢
were united and immediately atter the
marriage ceremony uindo lett her. The
desertion of her husband preyed on ber
.mind, and when she discovered letters
that disclosed her husband's infidelity stiÂ«
decided to end her life. Finding: a" box
of poison in the house she prepar i to
die. tier actions aroused the suspicion of
Mrs. Kelly and she carefully watched her,
with the result that sht saved the
woman's life
Secretary McMurray of the SociPty fir
the Prevention of Cruelty to Children v ill
be notified to-day of the woman's condi- '
tion. and it is probable he will arrest Hie '
unkind husband for his cruel desertion.
Th^ mother, 'who is a neat and comely
looking woman, aroused the eympathj of
the hospital attendants when they heard
her sml story.
Mrs. I.indo says her husband earns a
good salary, and th<\v lived in compara
tive happiness until hi became acquainted
with a Mis. Tilmas, with whom, sht- says,
he is now living at 117 Leavenwqrth str>-<t
Since Lindo deserted hi* wife for Mrs.
Tilmas he has contributed only $;i ;| month
toward the support of his family.
The poor woman's excited the ,ive
ly sympathy of Matron Rose Kan. and
she sent a frtf-nd to interview Lindo The
latter w,ns found at the restaurant where
he is employed, and when remonstrate d
with for his heartless neglect Âf his wil !
and baby he terminated the interview
with a gruff "Go to â â . I know OIV busi
ness."
Mrs. Lindo sppnt the night at the Kf
ceiying Hospital, and to-day measured
will he taken to compel Lindo to make
adequate provision for his wife and child ;
Teamster Goes Insane.
C. A. Askins. a teamster, was arrested
at the St. Davld'.a House, on Howard
street, last night by Officers Reach and
Chase of the Southern station for threat
| enir.g to kill his wife. He was violently
insane, and it took four men to hold him
; until the officers arrived. Askins has
been acting queerly for some time, and
Wednesday he was taken into custody by
Officer MrNamara at the request of his
: wifÂ«\ A night in the cell in th<Â» Insane
ward of the Receiving Hospital had a
! quitting effect on him and yesterday he
| was discharged, but soon developed more
violent symptoms than ever. He will
i probably he examined by the Insanity

AGRICULTURAL SCIENTISTS.
ONE i the events of the summer for which we
must make due and ample preparation is the
convention of representatives of American
lieges and experiment stations, which
mble in this city on July 5. The meeting
will bring to California many of the most eminent
agricultural scientists in the country, and their study
le rural industries of our State cannot fail to be
of great value not only to themselves but to us.
The days when agriculture consisted wholly in the
applicatioi â¢to the soil have long gone by. At
the present tin ther occupation of man engages
luch scientific research and experiment. Every
thing connected with rural industry has become more
or less a subject of keenest investigation. The soil
submitted to chemical analysis, and the na
ture lant is analyzed to determine what kind
iil ;- best adapted to it ai . â â¢'..â¢ fertilizers are
.red in particular localities to enable it to thrive.
From the ground up. therefore, to the highest accom
â nent in the cultivation cf trees and vines, the
whole scheme of agriculture has been revised and
reordered in the light of scie-
The member- of the Association of American Agri
cultural Colleges represent the highest skill the world
yet attained in the study of science as applied to
the cultivation of the soil. Much in the way of ex
tent and investigation has of course been carried
on in European countries, and great results have been
ned there, but in no other land has so much study
and such extensive experiment been made as in the
United State-. With us not only has every State its
ultural college and experimental farm, but our
farming population is more intelligent, more progres
than that of any other nation, and as a conse-
is now far in advance of the
re<t of the world.
The rural industries of California have been built
â¢ y men from all States in the Union and from
nearly all nation?. We have learned something not
, the science of Germany and France, but
the patient toil of China and Japan. N'everthe
nains much to learn, and from the ob
servation- and criticisms of trained experts from all
the Union we may derive lessons which will
be of vast benefil to us, if we rightly heed them and
make use of them.
It is gratifying to learn that it is the intention of
iving in charge the reception of the coining
tors to show them something at least of all the
different sections of the State. They are to be enabled
to see how widely varied are the resources and rural
tries of California, and to have opportunities to
study our fruit districts, vine districts, wheat dis
tricts, suprar beet districts and grazing districts. To
. ';. prepare for such extensive visits it will
be to provide ample funds, and all
of the State where visits arc to be made
of course be expected to assist in providing
them. To raise the required fund is now the imme
diate duty of all who are interested in our rural in
dustry and in our reputation for hospitality, and the
duty should be responded to with promptness and
with liberality.
After all the Democratic feasts and powwows not a
single idea has been put forward to point out how
harmony can be arranged between the warring fac
tions. There has been wind enough and to spare at
every meeting, but not a straw to show the way it
b'.ows.
The small boy with the toy pistol is the evangel of
the newspaper announcement. "Didn't Know ft Was
Loaded." Twenty-six of him have been disarmed re
cently by the police of this city, and a nervous public
breathes once more.
The death of Supervisor Aver makes a big vacancy
in the government of Santa Clara County, but it is
Â«afe to say that in appointing a successor Governor
( iHRe can be relied upon to make a blunder big
enough to fill it.
Paris should consult some authority on nerves.
With its Dreyfus, Marchand and a dozen other nerve
t xcitcrs the great city seems to be bearing the burden
of a serious siege of national hysteria.
The Chinese and the Germans, the Japanese and
the Russians, have clashed in deadly conflict. The
time is opportune for the Czar to suggest a few more
ideas for his peace conference.
CORPORATE AGGRESSIONS CHECKED.
IN The Call of May 26. 1899, attention was directed
to the decision of the Supreme Court of the United
States in the case of the San Diego Land and
Town Company vs. National City and others, in
which a decree of Judge Ross in the Circuit Court of
the United States at Los Angeles had been affirmed.
It was then pointed out that both in the lower
and in the higher courts the rights of municipalities
as against corporations that furnished water or
other public utilities had been trenchantly enforced,
and that the rule established by the decision covered
the pretension of the railroad in the grain rate case
!to the effect that practically the Federal tr'rbunal
I would usurp the functions of the Railroad Commis-
I sion and determine what reasonable and just freight
and passenger charges ought to be.
Feeling the pinching effect of the latest expression
from the highest source on this important question,
railroad organs have industriously sought to misrep
resent the opinion, written by Mr. Justice Harlan, in
the case to which we have referred, as in other re
! spects they have dishonestly endeavored to attribute
jtc Judge Morrow opinions which, if he entertains
them, he has never expressed. It is a common rail
road trick to pretend that in some respect the law has
been declared in conformity with its aggressive at
tacks upon the public or to minimize the influence of
a hostile ruling by assuming that it is merely the ex
| pression of some doctrine from which there has been
no dissent. For example, even the railroad would
concede, as an abstract proposition, that the limit of
: judicial interference with rates established by State
I authority is to ascertain whether they are reasonable
; and just. But, in the practical application of the
I proposition its constant effort for years has been to
: induce the Federal courts to hold and to assume that
i they had held, not that they would look into a record
I merely to see whether a Railroad Commission had
â  exercised some intelligent discretion and had not ar-
I bitrarily formulated rates that were obviously unfair,
i but that, in the performance of this duty, they would
i virtually base their conclusions upon their own judg- i
1 ment of the facts.
The full text of the opinion of the Supreme Court
of the United States is more drastic than the tele
graphic synopsis had indicated. It is unusually full,
concise and explicit. It reviews and clarifies former de
; cisions in respect to freights and fares that had been
misinterpreted, and, citing the case of Spring Valley
Water Works vs. San Francisco ($2 California
Reports, 286-315), holds that no State constitu
tion or State law which requires the exercise
1 of discretion and judgment in fixing water or railroad
; rates can be impugned as violating the Federal con
stitution, and that before action of this character can
be successfully assailed, in the language of our own
Supreme Court: "There must be actual fraud in fix
ing the rates or they must be so palpably and grossly
unreasonable and unjust as to amount to the same
thing." In other words, whether the judgment of a
board in establishing rates for corporations exercis
ing franchises derived from the public be regarded as
judicial, legislative or administrative, or as a mixture
of the three classes of powers, it can only be ques
tioned when its'effect is confiscation. '"Judicial inter
ference should never occur unless the case presents,
clearly and beyond all doubt, such a flagrant attack
upon the rights of property under the guise of regu
lations as to compel the courts to say that the rates
prescribed will necessarily have the effect to deny !
just compensation for private property taken for the
public use." And. in words that are exceptionally
pertinent and important in this State and in this
municipality, the court adds: "But the rights of the
public would be ignored if rates for the transportation
of persons or property on a railroad are exacted with
out reference to the FAIR value of the property
used for the public or the FAIR value of the ser
vices rendered, but in order simply that the corporation
may meet operating expenses, pay the interest o.n its
obligations and declare a dividend to stockholders.
IF A RAILROAD CORPORATION HAS
I BONDED ITS PROPERTY FOR AN AMOUNT
THAT EXCEEDS ITS FAIR VALUE, OR IF ITS
CAPITALIZATION IS LARGELY FICTITIOUS,
IT MAY NOT IMPOSE UPON THE PUBLIC
THE BURDEN OF SUCH INCREASED RATES
AS MAY BE REQUIRED FOR THE PURPOSE
OF REALIZING PROFITS UPON SUCH EX
CESSIVE VALUATION OR FICTITIOUS CAP
ITALIZATION." These propositions are em-,
phasized and summarized in the declaration: "What
the company is entitled to demand 1 in order that it
have just compensation is a FAIR return upon
the reasonable value of the property AT THE TIME
IT IS BEING USED FOR THE PUBLIC." â 
These extracts, sustained by the most irrefragable
argument and by numerous authorities, practically
settle the main issues between the railroad and the
State and between the municipality and the water and
gas monopolies. If the temporarily suppressed ques
tions in the grain rate case are revived, as they un
questionably will be when Railroad Commissioners
Blackstock and Laumeister are superseded by repre
sentatives of the people, Mr. Huntington will ascer
tain that his grip upon productive industry has been
relaxed.
A WAIL FROM PORTO RICO.
OUR colonial responsibilities are like misfor
tunes in one respect at least; they have hot
come singly. While our attention is mainly
directed to the righting Filipinos we are now and then
called upon to give some heed to the discontents in
Cuba, the demand of Hawaii for a permanent form
of government and cry of the people of Porto Rico
for what they call justice.
The Filipino and the Cuban desire independence.
The one is fighting for it and the other is waiting
patiently for us to give it to him. The Hawaiian
desires to have the immigration question settled so
that he may know whether to import more coolies or
to set about the task of deluding white men to come
to his plantation. The Porto Rican asks neither for
independence nor a solution of a labor problem. He
asks only to be recognized as an American citizen.
In a recent statement of the situation in the island
the Porto Rican commissioners at Washington said:
"The people are rot governed by the laws of the
United States, but are under the sword of a military
governor, whose dictum is absolute and without ap
peal. The islanders are denied the rights of citizen
ship, and having broken with Spain and not yet being
recognized as citizens of the United States are a peo
ple without a country. Even the Spaniards on the
island have more rights and privileges. They can take
out papers and become American citizens, a privilege
not accorded to the Porto Ricans. Instead of abso
lute free trade between the United States and Porto
Rico, as on interstate and interterritorial principles, a
high tariff is kept up, unlawfully and without mercy,
impoverishing the island, for when the customs are
paid all the profit? are gone."
The imperialist who holds the most despotic view
of our right to govern our subjects as we please can
hardly deny the justice of the Porto Rican claim.
Military rule is objectionable even to the people of
I the old world, and why should we impose it upon a
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JUNE 9, 1899.
people of this hemisphere? The Porto Ricans have
done us no wrong. They have shown themselves
willing to accept our government loyally and are
eager to be identified with us. They ask of us nothing
except fair trade and a government less arbitrary
than that of a barrack yard. We cannot deny such
claims without denying the principles of the consti
tution and of the Declaration of Independence, and
it is certainly not worth our while to deny so much
for the sake of imposing a tyranny upon a friendly
island.
The evil is likely to become even greater than at
present. As the commissioners have asserted, the
people of the island hailed the advent of their deliv
erers from the Spanish yoke with joy and gratitude,
but they now feel deeply aggrieved and enraged at the
manner in which the Government has abused their
rights and privileges, and are ready to adopt any
means whatsoever for self-protection and the ame
lioration of their condition, even to a claim for abso
lute independence.
Such is the situation. We can overrun and conquer
the Porto Ricans, of course, but such conquest would
entail upon Us another petty war with guerrillas, in
which we would be forced to carry fire and the sword
where we ought to carry the plow, the schoolbook
and the Bible. Already we have learned that impe
rialism has its dark side, and now we see it has a
tendency to go from bad to worse.
CONDITIONAL IMPERIALISM.
THERE are a few conditions under which The
Call, which has always stood by the navy, the j
army and the flag, would abandon its loyalty to j
< the American Government, cease to be Republican j
| and convert itself into a vigorous advocate of for- j
! cible expansion wherever our national power could j
; reach.
These conditions are definite and intelligible.
Some imperialistic lawyer must discover consti
| tutional objections to the Declaration of Indepen- j
; dence and secure a favorable decision by an American j
; court of the highest jurisdiction. He must also ob- ;
: tain a judicial determination that sedition consists of j
rigid adherence to American institutions. Some !
i authoritative teacher of the moral code must collate '
the scriptural texts, especially in the New Testament. ;
! that enforce upon civilized nations the duty of pound- â 
I ing the principles of fraternity into unwilling and re- ,
; sisting barbarians. Some astute statesman must ;
demonstrate the necessity of establishing the suprem- j
acy of military power both at home and abroad and j
of coercing rebellious "subjects" of alien races, who;
i assert their own individuality and decline to acknowl
' edge the fact that the Almighty denied them the per- !
; rp.anent occupancy of their native soil and the right of ;
â¢ self-government but granted them a temporary pos
session for a few thousand years until a republic had '
been specially erected to purchase and enforce their
; allegiance. Some accredited historian must recon- j
; struct the history of Rome and prove that the Roman '
! republic was perpetuated by imperial colonization.
Some invincible philosopher must demonstrate the
j absurdity of governmental systems that accept man as >
J a political entity or treat him as an individualized in- !
| teger in civilization. Some learned apologist must j
j successfully explain to Great Britain our deep regret
i that our predecessors denied her authority or claimed
, that taxation and representation were correlative or
' that the thirteen colonies had any rights, provisional
'â â  or inalienable, that the House of Brunswick was
bound to respect. Some modern biographer must
rewrite the lives of Washington, Jefferson, Adams, ;
, Madison and /Other deluded founders and expositors \
I of. our institutions and clarify the mystery of their
failure to realize their own imbecility. Some com
prehensive jurist must show that our Civil War had
no connection with the constitution and the Federal
Union, but was an anticipatory development of a
policy of subjugation. Some original Republican j
j must correct our political records by conclusive proof
that, before, during and after the Civil War, Repub- !
lican platforms were shams, that the constitutional j
| amendment abolishing slavery was a series of typo- j
j graphical errors and that the later amendments were
i spurious interpolations. Some preserved filibuster i
| must justify the attempted invasions of Nicaragua
and of Cuba by official authorization from the Gov- ;
; ernment archives. Every strictly American expres-
I sion in favor of liberty and independence, under con- :
j stitutional safeguards, must be expurgated from the
I works of Webster, Clay, Calhoun, Benton, Douglas
j-and the host of Federal Senators who led down to
i Dan Burns. Every decision of American tribunals, ;
I every declaration of the law, fundamental or derived, â 
, by institutional or constitutional writers, n,ot based
! upon an imperialistic precedent or direction, must be
j eliminated. The messages and other state papers of
! our Presidents, from Washington to McKinley, the i
I opinions of our Attorney Generals, the diplomatic i
j utterances of the Department of State and of our
! representatives in foreign parts, must be destroyed, as
any attempt to harmonize any part of them with the
doctrines of the expansionists would be futile. The
American common school system and all American ;
| textbooks of a historical impression, together with the
I entire mass of colonial and national annals, must be
obliterated. Our national anniversary, with all its
memories and all its associations, must finally be dis
carded. Columbia must assume the costume' and wear
the tiara of an Empress and Uncle Sam must be ar- i
rayed in the uniform of a Czar.
When all these transformations have been effected, |
our associated commonwealths and our national
Union recast in the moid of British imperialism, and
the metamorphosis accepted by seventy millions of
Americans, with their own sovereignty yielded and i
with their own training, their own character and their j
own ideals revolutionized; when the American eagle
has made a new eyrie on the peaks of other and dis- j
tant lands; when the Atlantic and the Pacific beat j
J a perpetual dirge on the shores of a flead continental
j republic and the genius of humanity vainly searches
for its lost inheritance â then, but not before then,
The Call will join the ranks of the intolerant ex
pansionists and confess that the American experiment
is ended.
When that concatenation of events is perfected Mr. j
Iluntington will be apotheosized as a statesman, a
patriot and a philanthropist, and Governor Gage and
Dan Burns will have herded the American people into i
the paradise over which these heavenly twins affec
tionately preside.
It is* announced that a recent trip to Los Angeles |
had the startling effect of changing the opinions of ;
Governor Gage on the political situation. There may
be some consolation in the fact that his Excellency's ;
j opinions could not change for the worse.
There is such a thing as an "Ohio Valley Bimetal- !
lip League," and since it has recently acted as if it
were the whole people of the United States, there
can be no doubt that it really represents a portion at
least of Ohio sentiment.
Recent events show that Paris can no longer wag
France as it could in former times. The republic has
become bigger than the capital, and the boulevards
can no longer cause a revolution without consulting
. the provinces.
SURGEON GENERAL
STERNBERG WILL
VISIT THIS CITY
Colonel Forwood Pre
paring for Him.
MEDICAL OFFICERS EXCITED
â _^ â
MAJOR GIRARD FOR THE NEW
HOSPITAL.
â¦
The First California Will Arrive by
the Ist pf August and Probably
Sooner â Second Oregon
Starts Monday.
â â¢â¦ â
The approaching arrival of Brigadier
General George M. Sternberg. surgeon
general of the army, has caused a flurry
of excitement and anticipation among the
medical officers of this department. Col
or el William H. Fo'rwood, chief surg i
of the department, has begun to issue or
ders right and left and the surgeons and
assistant surgeons are kept on the jump
getting everything in ship-shape order
for the arrival of the surgeon general.
Colonel Forwood is determined that his
superior shall find the affairs of his de
partment up to date.
General Sternberg. with his wife, is ex
pected here two weeks from next Sunday.
He is combining business and pleasure
upon his trip and will be here some little
time. The medical affairs of this depart
ment have assumed such magnitude that
General Sternberg. who is noted for the
persona] care he gives to all matters per
taining to his department of the army,
has decided to come here in order to have
a look at things for Himself.
The new general hospital at the Presidio
is to be turned over to the medical depart
ment on July i, and General Sternberg will
be here and make an inspection of the
buildings before the medical officers take
charge. Major Alfred C. Girard has been
selected to have charge of the new hospi
tal. He is an officer of long experience i
and has a brilliant record as a surgeon.
During the recent war he was a lieutenant
colonel of volunteers, and was the chief
surgeon in charge of Camps Alger and
Meade. Major Matthews, who has been!
ir. command of the general hospital at the â¢
Presidio, will no doubt be under Major
Girard at the new hospital. General Stern
berg will make an inspection of the post
hospital at the Presidio and also the old .
general hosppital, and he will in all prob- i
ability visit the other posts in the depart
ment for .the purpose oi inspecting the va
rious hospitals. General Sternberg left I
Washington last Monday, and it is hi 3 in
tention to stop over at a number of the
army posts before arriving here.
Major Matthews, who was summoned |
Kast on Monday to appear as a witness in :
f. case, is expected back in a week. Dur
ing his absence Captain Shaw, assistant
surgeon, is in command of the general
hospital at the Presidio.
The instructions received by Thomas J.
Ford, superintendent of mails at the main
office in this city, from the Postmaster
General that airmail for the California.,
Oregon and Nebraska regiments, be held
here has again started speculation as to
when the First will reach San Francisco.
The officers at department headquarters
know nothing beyond the dispatches re
ceived from Waship.von, but it is now !
certain that the California will not be the â 
first rf-giment to leave the Philippines, al- i
though it was promised that the regi
ments were to be returned in the order in
which they left. The Second Oregon will
sail for Portland on Monday and will be
followed by the First Nebraska, which
regiment did not leav3 Camp Merritt until
the First California had landed at Manila.
This, ii is said, is not a broach of faith
v.pon the part of the War Department, but
by force of circumstances it is impossible I
tot the California boys to be the first to
leave. The Californians are at Negros.
and they cannot relinquish that post until j
they are relieved by the Sixteenth Infan- !
try some time next week. Judging from I
this, the First should get away from Ma
tfla certainly by the last of this month,
which will bring thr-m home by the rirst
of August. Some of the officers are in
clined to think that the First California
may arrive here by the middle of July
but hardly before that. If they should
get away by that time it will take a
month for the voyage, so that at the !
earliest calculation tlie men of the regi
ment can not be mustered out before the
middle of September, and it may be the
last of that month before they again don
the garb of citizens.
Major General Shafter, who has been at
Bakersfield for the past few days, will be
at department headquarters again to-day.
He is expected to reach the city at "9
o'clock this morning.
Leave of absence for one month, with
permission to go beyond the limits of this
department and to apply for an. extension
of one month, has been granted Fir;;
Lieutenant John C. F..x, First South Da
kota Volunteer Infantry.
Private Otto S. Erlebach, Company G
First California, and Private George
Gourlay. Company I, First Colorado, who
are at the general hospital at the Presidio,
have been ordered sent to their respective
homes to await the rinal disposition of
their cases by the War Department.

SEAMEN SCORE
VICTORY OVER
SHIPMASTERS
Captain Nelson Takes
Union Men.
THEY WILL MAN ALL HIS SHIPS
A HARD BLOW FOR THE SHIP
OWNERS' ASSOCIATION.
Twenty-Seven Sailing Vessels and
Five Steamers Fly the House
Flag of the Wealthy
Lumber Dealers.
The Seamen's Union of the Pacific has
won a great victory over the Shipowners'
Association. It has brought over to its
side one of the association's vice presi
dents and strongest supporters and there
is in consequence jubilation in the union
camp. This latest addition to the em
ployers of union labor owns twenty->> v< a
sidling- vessels and five steamers, so there
ia good cause for the joy felt by the mem
bers of the Seamen's Union.
The schooner Metha Nelson sailed for
Tacoma last Wednesday. She went into
commission in 1896, and last Wednesday
was the first time in her history that she
sailed with a full union crew. At dif
) ferent times union men have formed part
of her crew, but on this occasion the
men were secured 'in a body from the
| union shipping office. The owner of the
! Metha Nelson is Captain Charles Nelson,
i the well-known shipowner and lumber
dealer. He owns the steamers Centen
nial, Charles Nelson, Cleveland, Laknn>
and North Fork and about twenty-live
sailing vessels, among which are the
barks Colusa, John C. Potter and Edward
May and schooners Olga, Ottillie Fjord,
Mary Buhne and Mary Dodge. Ail "if
i these vessels will now, according to the
: union, be manned with sailors supplied
â  from its shipping office.
When the Coast Seamen's Union was at
I the height of. its power on the coast it
made a demand for an increase in wages
> that made the shipowners fight back, the
rt-sult being the Shipowners' Association.
1 This was composed of nearly all the big
; employers of seamen on the coastâ A. M.
t Simpson. Charles Nelson and "W . B.
i Mighell being at its head. This combina- '
I tion struck a blow at the Sailors' Union '
from which it has never recovered. The
shipowners from that day regulated 1
j wages and the sailor had to take what j
\ was offered. The owners were invaria- '
; bly fair in the matter, advancing wages*
I in the spring and summer when busi
\ ness was good and cutting them down i
i when business dropped off and freights
| were low.
I About two months ago another fight be
gan. At that time The Call gave exelu
| sively both sides of the case. The ship
owners made an advance in wages which
the union did not think was fair and
equitable. Men were scarce and frietrhis
were advancing every day, and the saii
ors demanded $5 a month more than the
| shipowners were willing to pay. From
: That time on there has been more or less
: friction and not one of the Shipowners'
Association vessels have got away on
time. Some of them have been held two
I days and some a week In the stream
1 awaiting a crew and the expense v.
i consequence very heavy.
The fight has been a very bitter one
! and at times it looked as though the un
; ion would surely be beaten again. Si
i times its members resorted to violence
â¢ and a number of arrests were madt-, but
the great body of the men stuck to the
; preventing of association vessels from
getting crews, und in this they were in
a measure successful.
The trouble with the Shipowners' As
j soeiation is that it cannot secure sailors.
i So far it has been able to man all the
I vessels belonging to its members, but in
| order to do so valuable ttme has
I wasted, and then half the men were
i "green hands" who had never been to
; sea before. It is no wonder, then that
! one of the owners has decided to kick
! over the traces and take Onion men.

MEETING CALLED FOR TO-DAY
MANY ASPIRANTS FOR THIS
POSITION.
AuditGr Wells and Treasurer Truman
Are Agreed â The Patronage
of the Office Will Be
Divided.
At neon to-day Mayor Phelan, Auditor
Wells and Treasurer Truman will meet
and nominate Frederick W. Lees for the
position of License Collector, to succeed
Theodore F. Bonnet, the incumbent,
whose term has expired. Lees will receive
the votes of Wells and Truman, the Re

Mayor Phelan will vote for Bonnet.
There are many candidates for the posi
tion, the list including the names of Lees,
James, W. Easton, P. Tiffany, Oscar
Tolie, John Martin and Mr. Doane, late
of the firm of Doane & Henshelwood. All
have brought more or less pressure to
bear on the Republican members of the
commission, and some have even received
assurances that their names would be fa
vorably considered. Lees, however, has
the indorsement of the Republican organ
ization and yesterday was given to under
stand that he would receive the votes nec
essary to secure the nomination. He in
return has given a pledge that he will not
levy tribute upon any of the attaches of
the office in the event that his nomination
is confirmed by the Board of Supervisors.
It is said that Lees has received assur
ances from ten members of the board that
his nomination will be Confirmed. In re
turn for this each member is to be given
one place in the License Collector's of
fice. The balance of the patronage, which
consists of twenty-six places, will be di
vided between Auditor Wells. Treasurer
Truman and the Republican organization.
Wells and Truman will get four places
each, leaving eight places to be filled by
those who direct the local affairs of the
party.

Like a pair of gray ghosts Ben Bolt and ;
Olympus seemed to fly over the field at
Union Coursing Park last evening in the
final of the experimental reserve stake.
Ben Bolt, which won, was an almost pro- i
hlbltive favorite throughout at odds of 4
to 1. The covirse was a punishing one, the j
hare twisting and turning until it finally ;
reached the escape which meant another
y tso of .fe.
4 For one brief moment during the run
' :;ing of the final the hopes of the short- i
< nders were raised as they saw the fa- !
vorite snap at the hare and, missing, roll j
over and over. He shook himself together
and was soon In the running again, se
curing the flag finally by a saie margin.
The coursing yesterday was an experi- I
mrnt and proved a marked success. The j
attendance was large and the betting >
steady throughout the day. The favorites i
ran true to form, there Ing compara- i
lively few upsets. Among i hose that lost

WHOLESALERS' ANNUAL
FROLIC AT EL CAMPO
An Odd Programme of Games Has
Been Arranged for the
Picnic.
The annual frolic of the wholesale trade
of the city at El Campo on Saturday
promises to be jollier than ever before. A
list of games has been prepared odd
enough to interest Ihe most staid of mor
tals, and the programme will include
something for every one who attends.
The wholesale merchant will be expect
ed to lay aside his dignity and. with the
brokers and retail merchants who may be
there, join in a game of throwing hoops,
in which the men with steadiest nerve and
surest eye will win. The commercial trav
elers, bookkeepers and desk clerks will be
boys again, and their prizes will go to the
most skillful in a game of marbles.
Obstruction races have been planned for
boys, in which the prizes will not neces
sarily go to the speediest sprinters. For
the little girls there will be an odd race,
in which cakes of fancy toilet soap will
be placed at Intervals "about the track,
and the prizes will be given to the girls
picking up the most cakes of soap. The
best of this race will be that each little
girl will keep all the soap she picks up.
There will also be four boat races, one
for girls under 15, another for ladies over
that age. a third for boys under 16 and a
fourth for men. An attempt will be made
to confine the entries in these races to
persons connected with trade in Sin Fran
cisco.
The fat men and fat women will be re
membered. The babies will have their
sport in a candy distribution, in which
each will get a bag of sweeties. Then
those who like to dance will have Blanch
ard's band to entertain them, and the en
tire picnic will have a chance at the 300
presents which the wholesale merchants
have contributed as pate prizes.-
Many wholesale houses have put up the
sign. "This store closes on Saturday, June
10. for the merchants' picnic." For those
who can spend the day at El Camno there
Is a boat that leaves the Tiburon ferry at
9:30 o'clock. There will be another boat
at 1 o'clock for those who have only a half
day to spare.
As the tickets for the round trip are 50
cents, and there is absolutely no expense
to the picnic management for prizes,
there will undoubtedly be a large surplus
for the Children's Hospital, which is to
receive whatever is left over of the picnic
funds after the expenses are paid.

captain and all of the starboard watch
were nearly washed overboard and then,
when right off port, she ran into a north
wester that Lasted two days.
In his report Captain Cutler said: "We
had more than our share of light and
variable winds the first part of the voy
age. On one occasion we were becalmed
for fourteen days. We rounded Cape
Horn on March 29, and then our troubles
began. We had a succession of gales,
which culminated in a hurricane on April
12 in latitude 53 degrees 23 minutes south,
longitude ''I degrees west. There was a
very high cross sea and the waves broke
clear over the vessel] filling the decks to
the rail. It was impossible to move about
and two of the crew who made the at

the bulwarks and severely injun I
"That storm had no sooner died down
than another came up. On April 20, in
latitude 37 degrees south, longitude '.'7 de

the southwest. There was a heavy head
sea running, and as 1 it broke aboard it
ewept the ship fore and aft. A wave that
broke aboard over the stern carried me

up to June B we had the usual weather, '
but in latitude 36 degrees north, longitude '
127 degrees west, on the date mentioned,
we ran into a northwester that lasted two
days. That was the last of our bad luck
and we made port without any more mis

OLD CLUB IN NEW QUARTERS
Richmond's Representative Citizens
Entertain Their Friends With a
House- Wanning.
President George R. Fletcher of the
Point Loboa Improvement Club never felt
better than he did las,t Tuesday evening
when presiding over the club which he
organised seventeen years ago, when the
Richmond district was a howling wilder
ness. The cause of his good feeling was
the fact that the club had moved Into Its
new quarters in Richmond Hall, on Clem
ent street and Fourth avenue, and in ad
dition to the change of quarters it was the
eighteenth anniversary of the club's ex
istence. The two facts brought together
a large representation of the 'very t.Â«y t
solid citizens of the Eavored Richmond.
A resume of the club's active work for
the betterment of the district could nut
be more tersely expressed than in the
words of J. M. Wilkins of the Cliff House,
who is chairman of the executive com
mittee of the Point LobOÃ Improvement
Club, when he said, in addressing the
club on the night of its anniversary; "At
the time I moved out to the Cliff House
seventeen years ago the Richmond district
had three houses and one roadwayâ Point
Loboa aveflue. Since then, through the
exertions of the club, one of the very best
systems of sewerage in the city has been
perfected, streets have been opened.
paved and put in proper condition: and,
still better, the place ihat was the home
of gophers and jackrabbits has become
the favored habitation of happy, thrift;.
and Industrious" families. .Mure money
has been spent by the property owners In
improvements In Richmond during the
past twelve years than in any other por
tion of the eitv of equal area.
"These are the reasons why I come In
from the cliff House every night that the
club meets. I recognize that it If through
th. work of this club and its president,
George R. Fletcher, that so much has
been accomplished for the extreme west
en, portion of San Francisco."
Other speakers followed in a similar
strain, all attesting to the great good
work done by the club and its officers,
principally President Fletcher, who has
Deen the mainstay of the club ever since
Its Mrih.
Among other questions brought before
the meeting was the Geary-street fran
chise. President Fletcher. In speaking on
the subject, gave It as his opinion that
there was (jttle use in spreading resolu
tions on the book for the mere effect of
gi Ing or. record In opposition to a ques
tion that is practically dead.
In order that the attitude of the club
and its president might not be misunder
stood by the public, Secretary W. i' â¢'â  hn
son Introduced b series of resolutions
drawing attention to the fact that the
club's president. George K. Fletcher. wa.Â«
the first person, years back, to call at
tention to the Intended steal of the Geary
street franchise and that due credit be
given to him. It was moved and unani
mously carried that the resolution be
placed" In the hands of the executive com
mittee consisting of James M. Wilkins
and John J. Cassidy. secretary, with
power to act. It was further brought to
the attention of the club that in 1897 it
was Mayor Phelan. A. B. Magulre and
President Fletcher who put their hands
in their pockets to meet the expense of
fighting the matter in the city courts.
The club expressed its indignation at the
reception its delegatfs had received at the
hands of the. Board of Education whet:
they presented themselves before that
body to request it to petition that a suit
able amount be provided in the tax levy
for a school building for the Point Lobos
district It was represented that the com
mittee of which the president wjw chair
man was kept waiting for three hours to
be called before the board. It was then
allowed five minutes to present its plea
and then curtly informed that the board
had too many demands to meet to rive
attention to the Richmnrfd district. The
sense of the club was taken, and at the
suggestion of C. Hansen it was consid
ered advisable that all interested in the
proposed school, both men and women,
ne present on Friday at 3:30 p. m. to call
the matter to the attention of the Board
of Supervisors.
\fter the business meeting an adjourn

nrosperity of the Richmond d. strict and
the welfare of the club were toasted.

PALACE HOTEL WILL
HAVE ITS THEATER
MANAGER KIRKPATRICX HAS
ASKED FOR ESTIMATES.
He Returned Last Evening After
Having Inspected the Big Play
Houses of the East.
The Palace. Hotel theater is to be a
thing of the Immediate future. So pays
Colonel John <_'. Kfrkpatrick, manager C
the Sharon estate, who returned last
evening after a month spe:it In visiting
the big hotels and theaters of the Eastern
States. *
"From the way matters look at pres
ent," said he, "I think I may say the
theater will bo built and it will be one of
the finest in the land. While in the Ka.-t
I called unon several prominent archi
tects and they became mon- enthusiastic
than I myself after I had described the
hotel and its possibilities from an archi
tectural standpoint.
I requested two of these architects-
one in Chicago and one in New Yorkâ to
prepare estimates for me as booh as they
possibly could, and I expect them out here
within six weeks," continued Mr. Kirk
patrick. "We will have 'â â¢ â o T
measurements for them out here ajid this
we will do at once.
"The theater will be built in the Jessie
street end of the hotel and will require
all that end of the building. There will
tie an entrance from Jessie street, another
from New Montgomery and one through
the hotel from the court. We have every
thing here to make one of the finest th' -
a â  rs in this country and at much less
expense than I at first thought. 1 confess
1 have come back metre enthusiastic than
when I left."
Colonel Klrkpatrick could not say how
soon work would be begun, hut thought
not long after the receipt bere of the
estimates he has requested.

JOIN HANDS TO AID
THE DEWEY MONUMENT
W' HEN the Dewey monument committee meets to-day the various sub
committees -will have some highly important reports to make regard
ing the progress of the movement. The most important matter just at
present is the raising of funds, and the amount of subscriptions received
up to date promises to surprise even the individual members them
( selves. Some handsome, subscriptions have been turned in to Treasurer Pond
I during the -week, but the members of the committee have carefully guanleil
the result of their individual canvtss for funds, preferring to make it pub
lic at to-day's meeting of the general body.
â¢ President Phelan and Secretary Fletcher have finished sending out circu
) lar letters to the Mayors of all the important Cities and towns in the State
> setting forth the object of the movement and requesting them to enlist thu
aid of their townspeople and arrange for the thorough canvass of their re
-1 spective municipalities. These letters are expected to have the most benen
) cial results. Every Mayor addressed will at once appoint a general com
i mittee to take charge of the work and collect funds.
[ Letters continue to pour in upon the local committee from all quarters.
' Many of them contain subscriptions to the fund, and all testify to the immensa
> popularity of the movement. Everybody feels that the interest throughout the
I East in the California plan to honor Admiral Dewey and his men has pl-iced
. the people of the Golden State upon their mettle and there must be no lag
ging until the great shaft has been finally dedicated.
> The discussion over the location continues with unabated interest, and

the matter of woodyards in hand.
It was also decided to establish a cen
tral medical bureau where the district
nurses and physicians may co-operate.

Maclean Hospital made application to
; Mayor Phelan. Auditor Wells, Supervisor '
i Holland and the members of the Board of
i Health yesterday for financial assistance
in lighting the smallpox disease that has j
broken out in the hospital. At present
there are seven persons suffering from the
disease in the institution. Inasmuch as
the hospital Is under strict quarantine and- :
no one is permitted to enter or leave the
place, the hospital physicians insist that
i the city provide immune nurses and take
i such other steps as will aid in the reeov- !
cry of the patients already infected and at
the same time assist in stamping out the
disease
The petitioners were given every assur
ance that their wishes will be complied
with, and the officials of the Health De
partment were instructed to take such
steps as to them seem necessary in thr>
premises. The new Pr-sthouse will be â 
| ready for occupancy by Saturday night ,
! and will be utilized for the receptio-n of '
I smallpox cases should any new cases be
reported.

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK. June B.â The market took on
the appearance of vitality and strength which
are associated .with a bull market at one period
dining the lay. but the Inevitable professional
realizing seemed to take the snaj out of the
market, and when the bears perceived that the
buying was not r?ne\MÂ»d with any eagerness,
even after the realizing offerings had ceased,
they attacked the market In the last half hour
and worked some very material recessions In
prices. Sugar. Metropolitan and Brooklyn
Transit close*! more than - points below the
high lÂ»vel. though retaining still good net ad
vances in price. A number â â¢'. the specialties
and prominent railroads also had a poll or
over taken lrom ton prices. The pi ntng of
the market was surprisingly tranquil consid
ering the amount of business that was being
aone. A long list of important stock opened
at unchanged prices and no sux-k In the list
showed a change of as much as a point in the
early transactions. It was evident that there
was a large bear part) in Sugar still uncon
vinced by yesterday's dividend declarations.
anJ they undertook to force down the price of
that very uncertain security. By the time 11
had fallen 2 points, however, the decline met
resistance of a kind which it was not in the
power of the bears to overcome. The experi
ence during the remainder of the day was not
an agreeable one and the heavy blocks ab
sorbed ai the hish level was convincing evi
dence of tt'.eir distres?. The advance In price
ct refined sugars, which was acquiesced In by
all Interests in the trade, seemed to bring home
to the bears that the competition could not be
of a v.-ry destructive character and mat the
opposing interests might be fairly regarded as
in.stille.i lr. the rositlon of insiders regarding
stock market maneuvers. The very buoyant
ton- of Brooklyn Transit, Metropolitan Street
Railway and Manhattan added to the discom
fiture of the bears. Later In the day tlie To
bacco stcck* took up the advance, yesterday's
dividend declaration on Atchlson preferred had
a very s-tnnulaUns effect on that stock, as well
iis on all the gram-carrying roads. The West
ern and Southwestern Mocks nearly all rose
over 0 point and pretty much the wholi rail
road list responded In sympathy, the only lag
gards t.eing a tew Southern roads which were
affected by selling for London account. Th.
announcement of a further shipment of 51,00(T.
--000 gold on Saturday, making a total of 13.500,
--000 <Â»n the movement, was without Influence In
thÂ» market. This outward movement of gold is
now generally understood to be due to special
Inducements offered by the Bank of England to
f-ecure a replenishment of Its reserve. There
are Intimations of similar pressure from Rus
sia and other Continental points, though no au
thoritative Information .an be secured on the
â 
The iron and steel stocks were conspicuously
heavy ill day, with .-no or two exceptions
though they did not suffer materially in the
later decline. Large gains were shown by a
number of railroad stocks seldom traded in,
including lowa Central preferred, Minneapolis'
St. Paul and Sault Ste. Marie common and
preferred. Hocking Valley. "Evansvllle and
rerre Haute and Dcs Molnes and Fort Dodge
preferred. The tone at the close was decidedly
weak. J
The market for bonds showed improved
strength â¢ and ar. increased volume of dealings
as the day progressed. Total sales $2,520.000

! CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, July S.â Only for a Bhort time
j following the opening in wheat was that mar
j ket governed by the influences usually con- !
| trolling The opening was rather weak. Juiy i
; starting at 7.'.V' â " i<\ compared with yester- !
I day's closing price of 75U,'f/75*,,c. Traders cvi- ,
, dently had in mind the greatly improved tone |
of domestic crop advices, especially as regards ;
j spring wheat, and considerable long whÂ»at was !
; thrown on the market during the first few i
! mn lutes' trading. This depressed July to 74* c, 'â 
: where a strong react resulted from tree ;
I covering by shorts and some investment buy- I
â  ing. following the posting of some European !
i crop reports, showing the condition in Rou
j mania and Ruse to be fully as serious as '
previously claimed. Before 11 o'clock the mar- j
ket had advanced to 7.V i/754e, the high point !
of the day. The beef was quite general that i
the forthcoming Government crop report would |
lie decidedly bearish. As the session wore on, I
this gradually overshadowed everything else,
longs were unwilling to hold wheat pending I
i the report, but found a great deal of difficulty j
! In disposing of the holdings, and the market !
! during the afternoon was a decidedly weak '
! one. July sold as low as 74 : -v and closed
at - ;7>.
Corn was rather slow, but steady, though I
not holding the best prices. July closed with i
a gain of â¢-' VÂ«c. '
Oats were slow and barely steady, July !
closing 'Â«â ' lower.
: Provisions were dull and declined slightly all I
I around In consequence of lack of support. Hog i
j prices were lower and packers offer. moderate-
I ly. hut the demand was almost entirely lack
| Ing. At tue close July perk was 7V> cents !

WHEAT AND OTHER GRAINS.
WHEAT News was less bullish yesterday.
The weather was reported seasonable for grow
ing crops." Winter Wheat maintained Its con
dition and the spring outlook was more assur
ing. The condition of Indiana was placed at
50, with an estimated crop of 19,400,000 bushels.
Though there was not much Wheat pressing
Bt Chicago the crowd was bearish. Liverpool
and the Continent accepted offers of the day
before and bid for more. Later In the day
Cudahy and Dobson became large sellers, which
caused a break. The expected Government re
port made holders liquidate. The French crop
was reported only moderate, and the Russian
crop outlook was said to be disheartening.
I^oca] futures fell back, but afterward re
covered. Spot prices were unchanged

COFFEE circular of c. E. Bickford
gives the receipts at this port thus far this
year at 133,7)39 bags, against 99,235 during the
same tlmp last year. The sales from first hands
weie 75,579 bags, against 68,220. The stock in
first hands June l was 58.546 bags, again I 32,
--149 last year. The world's visible supply June
1 was 6,261,1 : bags, against 5, 475,022. The cir
cular says: "The extraordinarily heavy ar
rivals', 44,707 bags .since May 13, have naturally
had a depressing effect, and prices are lower
for all Coffees. The decline has not been an
: even one. In unwashed Salvador and the cheap
est qualities of other kinds, the drop hat been
fractional only â say from '^'iV. In fair to good
washed from Vi^l'". while higher grades have
sold so sparingly, and the sales show so much !
irregularity, comparing price with quality, that
It is impossible to furnish accurate quotations
It is sal â  to say. however, the decline in these
will prove relatively greater, possibly from l@2c
per pound In all. Recent large deliveries of
unwashed Salvador, sold in advance of arrival
as noted In the appended list, have completely
supplied the temporary requirements of Jobber?
and quotations are nominally steady at "Vi .
7%c, but without business. Taking Into con
sideration the deliveries on contracts made 'to.
arrive." business has been of full proportions
during the month, and dealers still seprn will
ing to buy freely of the lowest priced sorts,
often in advance of legitimate needs. Brazil
Coffees in New York have again turned easier,
being 140% C lower than on May 7. To-day's
first hand stock consists of 10.152 bags Costa

THE STOCK MARKET.
About the only changes In securities on \.he
morning session were an advance in Hawaiian
Commercial to $100 and In Market Street Rail
way to $Â«l.
On the afternoon call Kilauea Plantation ad
vanced to $30 75 ' and Giant Powder to. $75 50.
Business was not over brisk.
.There was no particular change in mining
stocks, though there was a weaker feeling
owing to the demand of the Miners" Union that
the electricians working underground on the
Comstock become members of the union. The
Pumping Association has invited a committee
of the union to meet It in. this city and discuss
the matter. The telegram from the pump said:
"We shut down the elevator for three hours
last night and found that' the Water rose very
'rapidly. Started the elevator again and it is
now running continuously. The water I.* 25
feet below the 1950-foot level. A large stream
of water Is still running from the 1950-foot
level Into the shaft."
The Reddlk Gravel Mining Company of Ne
vada County has levied an assessment of 5 i
cents per share, delinquent June 13.
The letter from the Justice mine says: On
the 370-foot level the upraise from the old west
crosscut is advanced 14 feet, following the ore
mentioned in the last weekly report. This
streak continues of the same width and assay
value as at the date of that- report. West
crosscut No. 1, from the station, was advanced
j 13 feet,- making its total distance 171 feet from
i the station. The face is In porphyry. During
I the week we milled 13] tons and 1850 pounds of
ore. The average car sample assay of the ore
I sent to the mill was: Gold, $12 2S; silver, 5.5
ounces: total. $15 57 per ton.
Further mining dividends for June are as fol
lows: Charleston, S. C, $20,000. June 1; Osceola
Copper of Michigan, $279,000, June 15: Republic
of Washington. $31,250, June 15; Tamarack Cop
per of Michigan, $240,000, June 27. The Golden
Star mine of Ontario, Canada, will pay a divi
j dend of $11,000 on July 1, making $41,000 to that
date, all for this year.

but that Supervisor Roeth wanted to
make it a condition that certain other
changes be made, to which the other
members would not consent. One of these
other changes fostered by Mr. Roeth Is
presumably the removal of Matron Mc-
Donald, for Mr. Roeth has on two occa

moval, but each time the majority of the
hoard declined to entertain the proposi
tion.
It was rumored to-night that the three
Supervisors, Church, Wells and Roeth,

succeed Keating as warden of the insane;
Miss Nlckerson, a protege of Roeth, is
to succeed Miss Mac Donald as matron,

FORDERER MAY RESIGN.
Uncongenial Associates and Poor
Health, Prompt His Action.
AL'AMEDA; June B.â Joseph Forderer,
for some years president of the Board of
City Trustees and who was re-elected a
member of that body at the last election,
will retire temporarily from active par
ticipation in public affairs and may resign
his office.
The strain of the last campaignâ of
the most heated in Alameda's historyâ
and the worry over municipal matters
have completely undermined Mi Forder
er's health. Two weeks ago he was
stricken with congestion of th- brain and
for a time his condition was critical.
Upon his recovery ..is physician advised
him that he would have to withdraw from
public life if he expected to retain his
health.
Mr. FordÂ« r has not been in harmony
with all the new members of the board
and his position was not the most con
genial. This fact, in connection with his
failing health, determined him to resign
his position.
Several of the city officials heard of Mr.
Fordtrer's intention and prevailed upon
him to reconsider his idea of resigning-.
He has decided, however, to ask for an
indefinite leave of absence. He will go
into the country for a rest, and if at the
expiration of several months he feels able
to resume his duties as a public official
lie will do so; otherwl.se he will present
hif> resignation.

THE COUNTY BOARD.
School Examinations Were Not at All
Satisfactory When Conducted
by Teachers.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,

V. M. Fisher, principal of the Central
School, makr-s public a statement that
â¢ from county school teachers

without merit and that its criticisms of

"The results last year," said Mr. Fisher,
"were far from satisfactory. There was
ierable criticism of the methods of

that most of this criticism came from
rival teachers, who did not approve of
th<> methods of the others.
"This year ti decided to take
charge of the examinations. The
results are quite apparent. It shows a
rrmny of the pupils supposed to be
ready to enter the high schools to be
poorly prepared.
"The questions given were not more
than ordinarily difficult. The board has
always prepared the questions, but Tiaa
left the teachers to conduct the examina
tions. This year we had personal super
vision of the examinations. The result is
that while there were some very bright
s there were a great number who
; to come up to the mark. It either
means that the students were exception
ally dull or that the teachers were in
capable, it seems to me to cast serious
reflections upon the teachers whose class

OAKLAND'S SMALLPOX SCARE
Ma*ny Were Exposed to the Disease
by Visiting Miss Olsen.
OAKLAND, June B.â Health Officer
Todd has taken vigorous measures to
: prevent any spread of smallpox. Consid
\ erable alarm is felt over the case of Miss
Lillie Olsen of 1913 Magnolia street, par
ticularly from the fact that as soon as
, she was removed from the Maclean Hos
-1 pital to her horn* in this city many of her
friends visited her and became exposed.
The health authorities therefore expect
that other cases of smallpox may be re
ported from almost any section of the
city.
"Fortunately the danger of contagion
in the early stages of the disease," said
Dr. Todd to-day, "is not so great as in the
j later stages. If the people who visited
I Miss Olsen will get vaccinated at once it
| will be well for all concerned. By vac
cination they can In a large measure pre
vent the spread of the disease, and even
should they take it, the disease would be
much milder. In the meantime, we are
using every precaution. The case of Miss
I Olsen is quarantined."

ASSESSMENTS
MAY BE VERY
LARGELY CUT
Dalton Is Using His
Hatchet.
COUNCIL IS IN DESPAIR
MAY BE FORCED TO MAKE A
BIG TAX LEVY.
It Is Feared That Five Millions May
Be Taken From the Values of
the Assessor Made Last
Year.
Oakland Office Pan Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, June 8.
Much consternation has been caused
amnng the City Counoilmen by the fear
that tin- assessment of the city of Oak
land will be reduced about $5,000.0tK) when
Assessor Dal ton has figured up his total.-..
Should tlsi reduction prove asÂ« great as
is anticipated, It will \v>rk havoc with all
the cherished plans <>f the new city gov
ernment, and will make it absolutely im
possible to restrict the tax levy to $1,
whiih was promised during the cam
paign.
Tho city's assessment fs about $46,000,
--000, and should it be reduced to $41. ' """
it will mean a reduction In tho taxes re
ceived of just $50,01)1 provided the tax is
fixed at $1. it will bo Impossible to run
the city along the lino contemplated with
any such reduction, even if all the salaries
which were rec< ntly cut for tho purpose
of staving off bankruptcy should be kept
after June 30 at their present figures.
The largest reductions have heen made
on improvements, although realty has
been cut to some extent. The assessment
of the whole county will probably be
nearly the sam< as last year, but the city
kland will be materially reduced.
Assessor Dalton said to-day that he run
not tell exactly what will be the total of
the assessment, but he is making heavy
reductions In property in the renter of
Ity. He has reduced Franklin street
from Fourteenth to the water front,
Broadway from Eleventh street and
Washington from Eighth. "It is very ap
parent t" everybody," he said, "that
property In these localities is not worth
what it was two years ago, and there is
no use in assessing it higher than is legit
imate. In some other places reductions
have been made, but taking; the whole
. the fig ires will probably be very
nearly those of last year."
The figures "f the County Assessor are
always used by the City of Oakland, sub
â  course to changes in individual as
si nts where such changes are made
by the Council sitting as a Board <>f
liza'tion. I Miring the recent cam
paign It was presumed that the assess
ment of the city would remain about the
same, and the candidates promised to run
thi city on $1. Should Mr. Dalton d
that the city has decreased In value to
such an exteni as the Council fears, it
will necessitate the reorganization of all

City Hall. '
COURSING AS VIEWED BY
SAN FRANCISCO WOMEN
THEIR VERDICT IS THAT IT IS A
CRUEL SPORT.
Boycott Will Be Employed to Compel
Tradespeople to Be Kind to
Domestic Animals.
According to the reports of the ladies
who iire organizing the bands of m< rcy
in this city the number of the bands and
the members of same arc Increasing rap
idly. The promoters of thin w.>rk are the
lady members of the Society for the Pre
vention of Cruelty to Animals, and at
their regular meeting yesterday the at
tendance was larger than usual. Mrs.
M. E. Holbruok presided.
At the previous gathering a committee
was appointed to investigate the charges !
<>f cruelty to animals made against those
! who are in charge of the coursing parks.
Mrs. Whiting stated that she had wit
nessed the coursing recently and had
; come to the conclusion that the hounds
nre more cruelly treated than the hares,
although the very manner of Wiling rab
bits by running to death and in shipping '
them to this city from great distances
are cruel acts.
The lady told with some feeling of see
ing hares tern to pieces by the hounds,
but she could not say but what the bun
!<.i< s were killed instantly. During, her j
investigation she was told that "the â 
trainers of the hounds stimulate the
ilugs by using Strychnine and cocaine,
from which drugs the animals suffer great
pain as soon as the excitement of the
chase is over." The verdict of the ladies
; of the committee was that "coursing is I
1 a wantonly cruel amusement and none I
: but the most degraded find any pleasure
in it. Furthermore, they were anything
but pleased with the appearance of the
frequenters of the coursing park.
Mrs. Clara Foltz delivered an interest-
Ing discourse upon the work of educating i
the children to be merciful to dumb ani
mals, and pointed out that the efforts of
the ladies in t. aching humanity in the i
public schools were Beed sown in a fertile â 
soil. A general discussion took place as
to an effective way of compelling a large
: number of ix-'iple to be kind to their mp
' mals. One lady stated that for a long
time she has dismissed her grocers, coal i
; dealers, butchers, laundrymen and other
; tradespeople whose drivers were guilty of
unnecessary severity in the handling of
the delivery horses. As a result more
than one cruel driver had been discharged
; and a more humane one engaged in his
stead by tradesmen who wished to hold
her patronage.
The ladiep thought it was a good plan, ]
and henceforth the boycott will be exer
cise.] in the interests Of mercy. At future
meetings notes will be compared and all
! tradespeople whose livestock Is not treat
jed properly will go upon tho society's
black list until such time as they ure
brought to their senses by the loss of
custom.

POSED FOR HER

MINER'S KNEE
Arlington Adds to a
Romantic Tale.
THE LADY NOT A WIDOW
MORE DUPES OF A SMOOTH
SWINDLER APPEAR.
One Victim Refuses to Swear Out
a Warrant, but Begs Him to
Return Her Mother's
Ring.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, June 8.
A little English woman called at the
County J;ill to-day to see Arthur Arling
ton, the man of many aliases, whose spe
cialty is playing- confidence games mi wo
men. She told a very earnest story, but
j would pive the jailer neither name nor
; address. She also is a victim of Arling
ton's wiles. Sl.'o says she has no desire
to prosecute him. but she is very anxious
to recover a ring which he took from her.
This ring w:is given her by her mother
and she holds it to be priceless. While
Arlington w;is preying upon her confi
dence, he became possessed of the ring
and she has never been able to re
j cover It.
He will give her no satisfaction as to
j whether he has it in his possession or
j whether he has pawned it. although she
i has made several visits to try to induce
him tn aid her in recovering the heirloom.
Arlington is a practiced schemer. He
evidently studies nut his plan to tne end
before he embarks upon it. One of his
victims, Mrs. Minnie Smith, told her story
yesterday. To-day Arlington continued
' the narrative where Mrs. Smith left off.
, Tne lady cut her story off abruptly at
I Piedmont Springs when the "wealthy
i miner ' who had engaged her as his
housekeeper snatched her purse contain
ing $214 85 and refused to return it.
Arlington says that his account is as
necessary to a compli te understanding of
the situation as that of Mrs. Smith. After
taking her purse he saya that he and the
lady remained in friendly conversation
1 and actually went to a photographer's
and were photographed in a rn.>st loving
attitude. ]n the picture Mrs. Smith sits
on the kn t the aged, wealthy miner
and their arms are locked around each
other's waists. This picture will foim
part of the case for the defense. Ac
| cording to Arlington, the pair then went
! to San Francisco, enjoyed a luxurious
1 dinner, took a hack ride and returned to
I Oakland, Arlington paying the joint <>x
pi uses out of the money he found in the
' lady's purse. He says that he only took
SI" at the springs and that Mrs. Smith
gave him $3Â«> in gti i tracks in San Fran
cis, -.i to be used for their joint amuse
ment.
Mrs. Smith, it is said, confided to Ar
lingUjn that she is not a widow, as *is
generally supposed, but has a husband
i in tho East from whom she is separate,!.
\ and that she is now living here with a
little daughter a sufficient length of time
to acquire a residence, so that she may
legally sue for a divorce. The friends of
the victim are not inclined to believe Ar
lington's story.

1 sent to this paper by Dr. John M. Will
iamson, chairman of the Board of Health,
and Dr. A. P. O'Brien, Health Officer, re
garding the precautions that should be
taken by residents of this city to prevent
the entrance and spread of infectious dis
eases. It is not intended to alarm the
community, but simply as a few words of
advice to lessen the possible danger. The
! letter is as follows:
sax FRANCISCO, June 8, 1599.
To The Call: Kindly call to the attention of
the public the following facts:
The recently increased Influx of passpneers
\ from Asiatic port*, particularly soldiers return
ing from the Philippines, renders the city
liable to the entrance and spread of infectious
diseases, as is evidenced by the appearance of
i several cases of smallpox within the past few
i weeks. We therefore feel it Incumbent upon
1 us to sound a note of warning to the residents
of this city In order that all necessary pre
cautions against an epidemic may be instituted.
Particular attention should be paid by house
holders and others to cleanliness of premises.
All garbage and refuse should be burned or
I speedily carted away, and chloride of lime and
whitewash used in liberal quantities. Persons
! who have not been Taccinated within a year I
; should, for' their own safety, attend to this
precaution at once.
Within the next few days the Health Depart
! ment will Institute a house to house inspection,
with the aid and co-operation of the Police De
partment, and cleanliness of yards, basements
j and outbuildings will he rigidly insisted upon.
This communication is not Intended as an
' alarmist measure, but merely as a few words
I of advice, which, If followed, will do much
; toward lessening the danger of a future epi
demic. JOHN M. WILLIAMSON, M. D.,

GRACE GORDAN'S DEATH.
Bits of Hair Found in Her Stomach
May Have Been the Cause.
An examination of the body of Grace
Gordon was made yesterday afternoon by
: Autopsy Surgeon Zabala, who found that
death had been caused by peritonitis,
superinduced by inflammation of the
stomach.
Miss Gordon nte dinner with her mother
last Wednesday evening In a cheap
i French restaurant on Stockton street and
partook heartily of boiled mussels. After
reaching home she complained of severe
pains in the abdomen. The pains In
creased in Intensity and frequency, and
Dr. Herrlngton was called in, but he was
unable to give any relief and the young
woman died. The physician diagnosed
j the case a? one of ptomaine poisoning
caused by some irritant, probably a de
cayed mussel, in the stomach of the de
ceased, He maintained this position after
the autopsy.
Dr. Zabala found seeds, bits of what he
believed to be human hair and other in
digestible substances in the intestines of
the dead woman. He gave, the opinion
that the inflammation had been caused
by some Irritating substance. He found
the young woman to have been In a very
weak condition and anaemic, so that an
exciting cause that would have no effect
upon a healthy and strong person would
be fatal to her.
It is probable that the deceased swal
lowed some of the mussel beards or pieces
of broken shell.

From Pintada.

VERY POOR WAGES.
From Fifty Cents to Two Dollars a

Fields.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN DIEGO, June B.â The steamer St.
Denis, which arriveu at Ensenada to-day
from San Rn<|ue, the landing of the Si
err;i Pintada placers, brings a very dis
couraging report, calculated to put a
stop to the rush of men to that section,
though several practical miners said the
reports would not deter them from mak
ing the trip to the diggings, where they
will prospect not for placer gold but for
rich quartz ledges which are believed to
exist near the placers. A special dis
patch received to-night by the Union
from its correspondent, who is returning
from a week's stay in the diggings, con
tains the following details:
Kxperienced American miners (not (tender
feet), who carefully prospected many miles of
the Sierra Pintada placers, aeree that there Is
nothing there worth while for Americans â not
even wages. ThÂ«> dally earnings per man is
I>!a''Cd at from 50 cents to $2 .'â¢0 American
money. The placers are extensive, gold ex
isting in small quantities In hundreds of
gulches, but it Is quickly worked out. The
present dlpÃinps are comparatively exhausted.
nn.i no claims have been located or considered
worth locating by Americans or Mexicans, po
far as oould be learned. The camp Is well sup
plied with Mexican dry washers, which (io the
best work. Nearly all miners have some gold
carrier! In cartridge shells, averaping from 50
cents to $2 iÂ»er man. Any ri.ch strikes made
have not been heard of In camp. Kmiliano
Ibarra stated to me positively that this Is no
Klondike; there is no bonanza at the Sierra
Pintada placers. Any American who has come
down here expecting to get rich by (ilsKins
Kold had better go home at once. Ibarra said
a liberal estimate of the earnings of the camp
would be- from $4 to $T> In Mexican money per
man dally. Franciscn Salorio, the customs In
spector, denieil to me that he said Mexicans
were getting gold by throwing dirt on blankets.
He saya he only said that Mexicans had told
him that they were making 1 what were to them
satisfactory wages. I am reliably informed that
Salorlo's report, as sent out from here, was
obtained hy him from a one night's visit to the
Water hole, eighteen miles from the placers.
Andres Strickroth of lbs & <'0., merchants
at Ensenada, returned on the Pt. Denis with
me and others. He went there expecting to
open a store, but quickly decided that the Meld
is not a good one and that the excitement will
so in subside. He said he was advised that the
total clean up of the camp for the past three
months was not more than $*>i>V), which is enn-
I a liberal allowance, and no considerable
amount of gold has been shipped from the dig
gings to Mazatlan or any other point. Some of
the passengers en route to the placers on the
schooners Negus, Acme, Alta and others
changed their minis here upon hearing the
news from the St. Denis, ami are returning on
the steamer to-night to Pan IM^gn.
Many miners are left at the placers.
and a telegram received late to-night
from Ensenada states that there is prounrl
for many of the previous reports Â°ent
out. There is gr>lr] in the digging's, but
many of the men returning on the St.
penis have found it "mixed with dirt"
and were discouraged. More favorable
reports than those received to-night are
expected later.

. eside the assembled loveliness oi
the fair young misses whose school days
aro now "over.
The programme was a more than usual
ly good one. Tho graduates furnished the
niuslcal end and President P. A. Bergerot
of. the Board of Education, Mayor Phe
lan; Superintendent Webster and Princi
pal Brooks lent their oratory for the liter
ary features*.
President Berber it's address was a
happy mingling of sage advice and a
tribute to the higher txiucation as pre- |
eented by the" fair young graduates. Ihe
speaker said in part:
This Is Indeed ft happy day, a blissful event
for you all. Ji will form an epoch In ycur
young lives worthy to be singled out "with a ;
white stone." To some of you it will mean j
the termination of your career as students and j
the signal for you to make your debut on the
stage of life. To others thes.* commencement I
exercises and your graduation from this school |
â nil! serve but aa a prelude for your admission
Into some higher institution of learning:, where
you may prosecute your studies in order to at
tain some definite purpose or goal. To all of
you it represents a period of three years which
jour instructors have faithfully devoted to
cultivating jour minds and hearts for the re- I
ceptlon of stores of useful knowledge and !
ennobling principles.
It is a trite saying, young ladies, that knowl
edge Is power. A liberal education, as far as
It; goes, is also power. The mental training
and discipline which it gives enable a person
to take a practical hold of life or to enter into :
almost any avocation or occupation not re
quiring special preparation. It transforms the
uneducated laborer or artisan from the auto
maton or machine that he often is into a :
rational, thinking. Intelligent Individual!* It
makes a better citizen of a man by broadening
his views of life and thincs and men. It. en
larges his sympathies and qualifies him for
moral or Intellectual leadership among his fel
lows. It (fives its possessor confidence in his j
own abilities. Educated men and women gen- ;
erally know what to do in any emergency,
when to do it and how to do it right.
It is not true, young lies, as announced
a few weeks afro in a p<Â«n-prandlal speech by I
one of the greatest capitalists, that there is I
prevalent in this country a tendency to over- ;
educate the masses. Such a statement, in the I
first place, implies a contradiction in terms.
There can he no turn a thing as over-education, j
It is universally conceded by liberal minds that ;
education is nn excellent thins, and. if It be j
an excellent thine for the wealthy class of our i
people, all the mÂ«>re is it an excellent boon for j
our less favored fellow, citizens. To say that
the Increase of higher education among the
people is a fact to be deplored is to admit
that education is a curse and not a blessing.
It is a libel upon human nature to utter such |
sentiments on the eve of the twentieth cen- !
tury. It is nothing more or less than a plea for |
the return of the dark ages, when learning |
was the privilege of the few. and when the
masses were In a statÂ«' of abject serfdom by j
reason of their abject ignorance and benighted i
condition.
No form of honest labor or work is degrading
to prince or pauper. Dr. Jordan tells us that
a boy fir girl can have no nobler ancestors than
those who have worked for a living. This |
truth may be extended by saying that the best
way to honor or venerate the memory of such
ancestors is to imitate their good example.
Labor If elevating. It is man's noblest orna
ment. Every form of excellence in the me
chanical, commercial, moral or intellectual
world arises from and Is traceable to labor. â 
Genius Is labor and labor is gÂ«xlllness.
young In.:. you are now ab vi to go out
into the world to accomplish your destinies in
your chosen spheres of action.
Life and existence and the world appear to !
you to-day as things of sweetness and loveli- j
ness. Your dreams 'I lans and air castles
are suffused with a roseate tinge that Is sooth
ing to the mental eye and which fills your
hearts with hope and inspiration. I, tor one,
on such an occasion as this, would not utter a
single thought that might mar your happy dis
position to look on the brightest side of things.
After all, your Ideals are not altogether an
Illusion. The searchlight of reality, as you
elbow your fellow creatures in the walks of
life, may perchance dispel some of the glamour
which now surrounds you: but, if you are prop- ,
erly constituted, II you have properly assimi
lated the learning which your teachers have
sought to instill into your minds, your ideals
Fhould survive and resist all attacks upon the
outer world.
Like everything that is mortal, you will re
ceive your proportionate share of those neees

never suffer any ills or reverses to depress
your hearts or to weaken your fixity of pur

silver lining.

The Lodi Hisrh School.
The Legislature of 1895 passed a law by
which high school districts could be es
tablished in localities of 1000 inhabitants,
and the population of Ixidl, San Joaquin
County, has the required number of in
habitants. Accordingly a high school dis
trict was formed and" a schoolhouse was
built. Reuben Pixley, n. taxpayer there,
; resisted the improvement, and by leave
: of the Attorney General brought action
against the district school trustees to pre
vent them from exercising the functions
as such. He claimed that his property
was being confiscated without due pro
cess of law in this: That the Superin
tendent of Schools made the estimate for
the improvement and the lavy was made
by the Board of Supervisors. His con
! tention was that the County Auditor, if
any one, should have made the estimate;
and further, that the law under which
the officials operated was a special law.
The case went to the Supreme Court on
appeal and the Justices decided that the
Legislature had the right to make the
law, ;us a high school is a preparatory in
stitution of learning and not like a col
!â¢!-'<; also that the law is in no way spe
cial.

DISCUSS PLANS FOR A
FOURTH OF JULY PARADE
ESTIMATED THAT TEN THOU
SAND WILL MARCH.
Grand Marshal Costello Selects A. A.
Borlini Jr. to Act as His Chief
of Staff.
Preparations for the big 4th of July
-ltion arc progressing rapidly, and
the members of thn various committees
are more than satisfied with the outlook.
A meeting of the parade committee, pre
sided over by A. A. Borllnl, was held lnst
evening and the details of thp parade
were discussed. It is estimated thero
will be fully K>.floo people in line on the
morning: of the 4th. The -Kxv> recruits at
the Presidio have been invited to partici
pate, as well as the Twenty-fourth col
ored Infantry, and it Is thought both in
vitations will be accepted. Tho recently
reorganized Fjfth California will also be
in line, and the regiment of Nebraska
volunteers, now en route to this port from
the Philippines, will also be here and will
be invited to march.
A sub-committee, consisting of Grand
Marshal S. V. Costello, Benjamin Davis
and I. Schwartz, was appointed to Inter
view the Western Meat Company and the
Butchers' Board of Trade to induce them
free to the closing of all meat mar
to ts on the 4th. Other storekeepers will
also be asked to close. A committee con
sisting of T. H. Robinson and Benjamin
]">avis was also appointed to consult mer
chant captains and naval officers of the
United States vessels in port on the sub
ject of decorating the ships on that day.
The regatta committee also met, and
â or Henderson was detailed to ar
range for *he decoration of all the ships
in the harbor. It Is also proposed to have
a yai ht race for the schooner class on the
afternoon of the 4th.
Grand Marshal Costello has appointed
A. A. Borlini. who was grand marshal of
last year's parade, as his chief of staff.
The other members will probably b
locted from among thj? officers now in the
city who served In the Philippines and in
Cuba during the late war.
DALY'S BODY WILL
BE BROUGHT ACROSS
Mourning in London Over the Un
timely Demise of the Greafc
Manager.
LONDON. Juno V-Th.' flags on Daly's
Theater were half-masted to-day on ac
count of the death of Augustin Daly, and
among the large colony of American act
ors and actresses here his demise Is the :
subject of groat regret.
Charles Frohman said: "I regard Sir
Henry Irving arid Mr. Daly as having
done more for the elevation of the Btage
in their respective countries than
managers of the time, ami America's loss
in this respect is Irreparable."
Mr. Daly left London on Saturday, hav
ing apparently fully regained his health.
and insisted on a little outing in Paris.
He expressed the fullest confidence in the
st;e<<ss of the suit against George Ed-.
wards (growing out of a dispute as to the
division of profits of Daly's Theater. Lon
<!mt!. of which Edwards is the owner ami
Daly the- lessee), which was to be called
on June 20, when Mr. Daly expected to
regain control of the theater. The Hon.
Mrs. Eric Harrington, a great friend of
the. late Mr. Daly, and Ada Kehan went
to Paris to-day with some friends in or- j
dor to console Mrs. Daly in her bereave
ment.
Mr. Daly's body will bo taken to the
United States for interment.
EXTENSION OXNARD
BRANCH OF RAILROAD
Work Will Be Completed in Sixty-
Days in Order to Handle the
Sugar Beet Crop.
OXNABD, Juno 8. â A party of surveyors
has boon at work for several weeks under
the direction of Construction Engineer
George E. Boschke on the linn of the
extension of the Oxnard branch of the
Southern Pacific, to Chatsworth Park,
where it will connect with the short line
running out from Burbank mi tho main
line lessening the distance to Los Angeles
about twenty miles. The total distance
fmm here to Chatsworth Park is thirty
four miles. This will ultimately form "a
par; of tho coast line from Los Angeles to
Ban Kranoisco. as tho distance j s shorter
and tho grades and curves easier than on
tho present route via Saugus.
James Cassian of Grant Brothers, who
are building the branch, arrived yesterday
with seventy-five men, ten cars of mate
rial and l 1 horses to commence work on
tho first eighteen miles to Somis, and
ground was. brokon just oast of
this place at 10 a. m. to-day. This
section of tho road is to bo completed
within sixty days, in accordance with the
agreement with the American Beet Sugar
Company to have the road in operation
as far as Somis in time to handle the beet
crop for the com Ins season.
PADEREWSKI'S MARRIAGE.

Miss Helen Rosen wore married at the

Wednesday, May 3. The pianist came to

NKW YORK, June Bâ On May 31 a spe
cial cable dispatch to the Herald from
Paris denied the rumor that Paderewski
had married Mme. Gerskl last December,
who, it was explained, was in reality his
own sister and had been the wife of Lad
islas Gerski. the violinist. It now seems
â  that there was truth in the rumor of the
marriage itself of M. Paderewski. The
pianist was unfortunate in his first mar

early 'age, with the care devolving on him
; of an invalid child.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CAT.L,, FRIDAY, JXJ^TE 9, 1899.
SHOT HIMSELF
WHILE CRAZED
THROUGH DRINK
Attempted Suicide of
Guy H. Borland.
BULLET IN THE ABDOMEN
WALKED THE STREETS HOURS,
THOUGH WOUNDED.
The Unfortunate Youth Well Known
About Town and Is the Son of
a Prominent Businear
Man.
Temporarily crazed by liquor, young
Guy H. .Borland, one of the best known
of the very young set who tread the
primrose path, sent a bullet into his body
last Tuesday afternoon and is now lying
in the Waldeck Hospital. The would-be
suicide is a son of James 11. Borland,
general agent of the National Surety
i ompany, with offices at 308 and 309 Claus
Spreckels building. Besides being a no
tary public, young Borland has been
clerking for his father, and it was in the
private office of the company that the
desperate youth lired the bullet that
narrowly missed a fatal course.
The elder Borland is at present in the
East and Guy has been traveling ihe
downward path for some time. Although
only a year or two pa^t his majority, he
has been a familiar ligure in the tender
loin for many months.
For the past two or three weeks, how
ever, his friends say he has been drink
ing to an unusual extent, and had de
veioped an appetite for absinthe, which he
consumed in large quantities.
The Inevitable woman in i lie case ap
pears in the person of a commanding
blonde, who has been an almost daily
Visitor at young Borland's office of late.
A tVw days ago the young man intro
duced her to an acquaintance as his wife.
The friend was surprised, as the woman
appeared to be Borland's senior by sev
eral years. To other friends Borland
spoke of her a-s his wife, and said he had
married her only a few days ago.
Tuesday afternoon Borland entered the
outer oltice, where two young lady sten
ographers were at work. He appeared to
nsiderably under the Influence of
liquor, but aside from that there was
nothing unusual in his appearance. Bor
land passed into the private office, locking
the door behind him. It was then about
3:30 o'clock.
The two stenographers thought nothing
of this and continued with their work,
when they were startled by the report ii
a pistol coming from the private office.
They summoned assistance from some ol
the adjacent offices, but it was impossible
to effect an entrance, as the door opening
into the hall was bolted a~ well as
other one. The janitor was sent for, and
|usi as he was about to force an entrance
the door opening Into the hall swung open
and young Borland walked out.
"Jt s all right," he exclaimed. No
body's hurt," and he entered the elevator
and went up Into the cafe. He was ii.ih-r
than usual and his vest was considerably
burned by powder, but he walked erect
bowed no sign of being woun< I.
â \ft.r a time Borland wern down stairs,
accompanied by the colored office boy. He
stopped In thi lobby of the building and
spoke to the janitor, who advised urn lo
ome fresh air and he would feel bet-
In the meantime, after Borland opened
the office door and went up to th.
the room was searched and an ola-rasn-
Loned derringer, carrying an unusually
bullet, was found. This was the
weapon the desperate youth had turned
on himself.
After passing into the street nothing
more was Been of Borland until about 3
o'clock that night, when he went to the
Wai. leek, and summoning the attending
physician opened bis vest and exposed a
wound In the abdomen.
"Can you fix that up?" hr- asked the
doctor without manifesting the least con-
Borland was taken in charge and an at
tempi was mad- to extract the bullet,
hut without success, as it was though! to
have lodged in the back. There had been
.-ome internal hemorrhage, and the doctor
was amazed at Borland's strength and
vitality in walking about for so long a
tune after receiving such a wound.
Yesterday the patient was placed under
an X ray. and it is hoped the bullet can
ated by that means. The attending
physician says that Borland's Strength
is simply marvelous. But he is in no Im
mediate danger and will entirely recover
if be takes proper care of himself.
His immediate relatives only are. al
lowed to Bee the patient and they will
make no statement whatever. In fact,
every effort was made to hush up the af
fair entirely, with the result that It did
not leak out for twenty-four hours after
the shooting. The colored office boy, who
left the building with Borland, has dis
appeared; the two stenographers will not
admit that they even heard the shot, and
those who were called in had nothing
whatever to say about it. .
Shortly after the shooting tho blonde
lady called at the office, and on being In
formed of the shooting hurried away and
has not since been seen.

According 1 to advices brought by the
steamship Tacoma from the Orient, the
bark Hesper, which sailed from this port
March 9, lumber laden, for Kiaochau.
came near being numbered among the
missing. On April 28, when in the neigh

was encountered causing her deckload to
shift and throwing the vessel on her beam
ends.
The main rail stanchions and bulwarks

eight points to port. In that condition
the vessel sailed nearly 1000 miles. One
hundred and twenty miles from Nagasaki

MRS. FRANCES BROOME
AGAIN UNDER ARREST
Attempts to Build a Board Fence
WhexÂ« the Obstructive Hedge
Was Removed.
SANTA BARBARA. Juno B.â Mrs. Fran
ces Broome, the woman who some time j
ago caused considerable disturbance when
the City Marshal attempted to remove a
hedge which was on the street in front of
her property In Michel torena street, whose
arrest caused much comment, was again
arrested this morning. Her trial is now
pending in the Superior Court and has
be.-n s.-t for August 1. This morning she
instructed workmen to build a board fence
where the hedge had stood and she her
seif superintended its construction. The
city authorities ascertained this and ; # n
mediately, by the advice of City Attorney
McNulta and Mayor Burke, the Marshal
s-et several men to work tearing down thy,
fence.
Mrs. Broomo attempted to interfere, but
was Immediately pui under arrest. She I
was taken before Police Judge Price and \
pleaded not guilty. Her trial was set for ]
the 20th inst.
Mrs. Broome promised not to attempt to (
put up another fence or to obstruct the
street In front of her property until after
her trial. Mrs. Broome returned from San

gone to secure counsel to defend her in
her case before the Superior Court, in
which shf> was charged with resisting an '
officer. She stated that she feared that \

BANK REFUSES TO
GIVE INFORMATION
Obstacles Placed in the Way of As-
Bessor Ortman <9Â£ San Joaquin
County.
STOCKTON. June B.â County Assessor
Ortman has met temporary defeat in his
initial effort to enforce the provisions of
the law passed by the last Legislature
providing for the assessment of national
bank Stocks. The Assessor cited H. H.
Hewlett, president of the First National
Bank, to appear before him for an ex
amination touching the value of the stock
in the institution he represented. Mr.
Ortman wanted a statement of thp as
sets of the bank in order to get at the true
value of the stock. Mr. Hewlett readily
gave the list of stockholders and their
holdings, but on the advice of Attorney
J. D. Nicol, by whom he was accom
panied, he declined to give any informa
tion concerning the assets of the bank,
the Stock's actual value, bills receivable
or loans.
The position taken by" the banker is that
under the Federal laws he is not required
to furnish any statement and that the
State law under which the Assessor
.'aims to be acting did not g<> Into effect
until after the first Monday of last March,
the day on which all property is made
assessable for State and county purposi s.
Assessor Ortman is a fighter, and the
matter probably will be taken by him into
court for a decision.

LESSONS FROM
MOSAIC CODE
Dr. Sanderson's Lecture
on Health.
CLEANLINESS IS A REQUISITE
SECRET OF THE SIMPLE LIFE OF
CHILDREN OF ISRAEL.
Modern D 5 leases Due to an Exhaus
tion of Vitality and a Failure
to Live as the Lord
Prescribed.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
STOCKTON, June B.â At the Adventist
gathering this morning Dr. A. J. Sander
son of St. Helena spoke of the conditions
of health as he Bald were revealed in the
Mosaic sanitary code. Special attention
was devoted to the principles which un
derlie those requirements by which the
children of Israel were distinguished from
all other nations. The principle of hav
ing fresh food, he said, is one that lies
at the foundation of perfect health, and
it is one of the principles by which the
children of Israel maintained their life
and health. Their food was only kept
over night on the sixth dayâ the food
prepared for the Sabbath. They cooked
their food sufficiently, the proper time,
and kept it in the proper condition. The
only meat that was allowed to be e*aten !
in the camp was that prepared by the ]
priests, eat<-n on the first day it was !
killed, or might possibly be eaten on the j
second day, but on the third day what- â 
ever remained was to be burned. The j
principle of cleanliness was also very
marked, fhose who ministered in the
sanctuary were obliged tp bathe daily
very frequently. They we*e obliged to
keep their clothes perfectly clean. When- !
ever the children of Israel were assem
bled before the Lord on special occasions
one of the first requirements was that
they should wash their clothes and be ;
perfectly clean. Their free, open life in
the wilderness;* their camp life with the
tents in perfect order and the system
which characterized all of the details of
their encampment, were all designed to i
educate them in the habits of careful-;
ii< ss and thoroughness.
Moses, qoI being able to enter the prom- ;
Ised land itself, and viewing the situation. :
unpleasant as it was, set himself about
to tiring out and to teach the people the
sanitary code, that was the best thing
that could be given them under the con
ditions that would surround them. He
saw that leproÃy would come in because
of their departing from the simple life
which they would forsake and the warm
climate of that region. The classes of dis
ease which he gave directions concerning
were comprehended under the heading of
leprosy and of what were called "issues."
Under his classification all diseases from
which any discharge resulted were placed
under that head and regulations made
accordingly. The priest was to be the
physician of the people. For the curing
of disease they depended entirely upon
the simple life which they were instructed
in live. If the disease was contagious
they were to be kept by themselves.
There would be no ground for the fear
of contagious diseases which we now
have if the ordinary sanitary precautions
which were required at that time were
in general use. The only method of puri
fication under the sanitary code of Mosea
was simply washing with pure water and
exposing to the sunlight for a sufficient
length of time, or exposure to the open
air. Whatever of itself was found to be
unclean was destroyed by Ore without
the camp. These fires were continually
burning.
"As a people," he continued, "we are
not here Buffering from the terrible epi
demics which are sweeping over the so
called heathen nations, but we are as a
people suffering from nervous disorders ,
which arc assuming alarming proportions.
Look at the thousands of nervous wrecks I
all around you; look at the thousands of
people who are coining down with con
sumptionânot because the germs of con
sumption arc so prevalent in all the coun- j
try, iiut simply because the health of the!
people, the resistance of the people has
been undermined and destroyed by the or
dinary methods of living. The use ofiÂ»to
bacco, the free use of tea and coffee, of
imat. the lack of confidence in God, lack
of rest fulness in the people, the lack of
trust in the power of God are all factors
in weakening our constitutions so that j
under certain climatic conditions and sur- I
roundings w< suffer 1 from the colds and
diseases which affect others. What is
true In being able to resist these light
epidemics and all other things from which
people suffer is also true of nervous pros
tration and to lack of â¢vitality and all
those things which weaken us as a people
and weaken every individual. The Lord i
wants his people to have perfect health. !
not because he gives them a miraculous |
store of health, but because they are so
wise iii understanding that they live in
accordance with the simple- rules of !
health, and as a result do not suffer from
disease. Common sense should be exer
cised in everything in life, whether in eat
ing or drinking, in working or sleeping or
r< sting. If we frdlow in those ways we !
are at liberty, as were the children of
Israel, to enter into covenant relation
ship with God, and there shall not be a
feeble one in our midst."

Federation of Democratic Primary
Clubs Commends the Stand
Taken by the Mayor.
At a meeting of the executive commit
tee of the Mission Federation of Demo
cratic Primary Clubs held last night at
Anderson's Hall on Twenty-third street
that body expressed itself In no unmis
takable language regarding the city of
ficials who have joined hands to defeat
the new charter. The following pointed
resolution was adopted:
Resolved. By the Mission Federation of
Democratic Primary Clubs, that the official;-,
who are seeking to overthrow th.> new charter
should be condemned as unworthy of confi
dence and not entitled to further support from
the voters of San Francisco.
Resolved. That these men who were elected to
office entered into an agreement by which they
were to .hold their office for only one year; and
they %vere so voted for by the people and paid
small assessments to their political parties on
thai understanding:. We consider that they are
noting in bad faith, and this ration will
ever hold these faithless officials in contempt.
After thus flaying the men who are en
gaged in nursing corrupt Democratic pol
itics several addresses on the new pri
mary okotlon law were delivered by
prominent speakers, among whom were
Major B. McKinne and A. S. I. illi-. J.

William Allen of Troop R, Fourth
Cavalry, Wednesday nipht. When
the bugle summoned all to rest
on this particular evening tho sol

self-inflicted bullet-hole thruugh hl3
head. Why lir took his own life is yet
a mattei of conjecture, lint t h<^ fact
thai he drank heavily and quarreled
with his comrades a short 'im>- before
gives strength to the opinion thai he
obeyed the impulse of a crazed and
despond* m brain.
The suicide was the subject of f- r''n
eral conversation at the Presidio yes
terday, where it occurred. Allen was
a favorite amon^ his fellow-troopers,
and, while it is acknowledged that he
was reckless when Intoxicated, th- >â 
all feel keenly his sad end. Accord-
Ing to the story of thi soldiers he had
been frequently indulging In liquor for
the past several days. <>n Wednesday
he sobered up during the day. tÂ»tn im
bibed again freely during the early
evening at the canteen. As he b<
drunker he picked a number of quar

The dead body of the soldier present
ed .1 horrible appearance. Bracing a
30-caliber cavalry carbine between his
knees he had seated himself on his
hunk, placed the muzzle In his mouth
and pulled the trigger. The face was
torn beyond recognition and a split ex

the far northern country. An expedi
tion sent up some months ago by the
War Department has been laying: out,
in co-operation with a United States
Postal Inspector, a mail route to be
known as the American route, in con
tradistinction to that hitherto used hi
conjunction with the Canadian Gov
ernment, from Skaguay over Chilkoot
Pass and the lakes to Dawson and
Upper Yukon points. This American
route as laid out starts at Valdez,
runs via Copper, Center and thence
goes overland to Eagle postoffice,

seve?al people. Sergeants Adams and

a revolver. They ordered it taken
away from him. The crowd then went
outside ;m<l the dispute -continued.
Many of his companions felt that Al
len was a dangerous man when intox
icated, as he had been arrested sev
eral months ago for having discharged
his revolver In the camp kitchen when
ii,t- cook refused to feed him after
hours, and iried to pacify him. in
stead of listening to their advice he
struck off In the direction of the cav

intention of securing another gun. On
the way he mci Private Schneider, a
mounted guard, and requested the
loan of his pistol, but was refused and
told to go i" bed. Schneider says that
tins was about 10 o'clock, and it was
the last time Allen was seen alive.
A shot was heard shortly afterward
by a number of soldiers on the reser

Such reports are frequent around mili

paid to them. An hour later the body
was discovered.
Allen enlisted in Kansas as an artil

five years ago and came to San Fran
cisco Three years ago he was trans
ferred to the troop of cavalry. He was
aboul 26 years of age, and is said to
have been a cowboy before he entered
army service. He was one of a very
large family, and Is said to have a sis

MAYOR AND MINORITY
WILL MEET GAS MEN.
A Conference Agreed Upon to
Discuss Differences.
If a Compromise Is Reached the Vexed
Rate Question May Be Settled
Next Monday.
MAYOR PHELAN, the mem
bers of the minority of the
Board of Supervisors and
representatives of both local
gas companies will meet at j
1 o'clock 'this afternoon in the Mayor's ,
office to discuss the differences at pres
ent complicating the lighting problem
in this city. Tin- conference was agreed
upon yesterday as the result of a sug
gestion from the gas company agents, .
who had called on the May that n
might be possible to effect some ad
justment of the matters in dispute.
It was agreed on all sides that th"
present state of affairs was unsatis- j
factory all around and that some
means should be taken to end it. The
Pacific Gas Improvement Company and
the San Francisco Gas and Electric
Company are dissatisfied that, by rea- !
son of the differences, they cannot col
lect moneys due them from the city;
citizens are disgruntled because they
are being forced to pay the $1 75 rate,
with an indorsement on their receipts
that they will get a rebate if the courts
dcide that the $1 10 rate recently
adopted by the Supervisors is declared
legal; the Mayor, the minority and the
majority of the Supervisors are, re
spectively, disappointed by the uncer
tainty that has attended the promulga
tion of that rate. The gas company,
it is said, is willing to come down to
a Hat rate of $1 60 to private consum- ;
ers; some members of the minority are
said to view a ?1 35 rate with ravor and
some members of tin- majority, It is re
ported, v. oujd be willing to compromise
on a $1 50 rate. As matters stand.
however, with the present differencea
between the minority and majority
wings of the Supervisors, it is Impossi
ble to arrive at any rate-or hit upon
any plan before the end of the fiscal
year for the payment to th'^ gas c >m
pany of any bills at any rate at all.
The gas companies are feeling the
pinch Just at pr< s.-nt more than any
other Interest concerned. In a com
munication addressed to the Mayor
and the Supervisors the Pacific iias
[mproverhent Company states the case 1
clearly and makes a covert threat to
turn off the light. The portion of its
communication dealing with these mat
ters reads:
The company once before was unable to
collect the bills for gas furnished the pub- \
lie buildings of San Francisco and lost its
bills for the months of March, April, May
and June. 1893, amounting to $775776. The
company would be willing to continue to
supply will: gas public buildings now
lighted by it and wait a reasonable time j
for the payment of its bills if it were
not that It knows that long before a legal
decision can be rendered as to the va
lidity of Its bills the general fund, from j
which these bills must be paid, will have
been exhausted.
The city now ewes the company for
furnished from December I, w.'V to May
27, 1899, 19759 75, and tho bill for June will
probably amount to more than $i:?n>. The
company respectfully represents that al
though "there exists a difference between
this honorable board and tins comp
as to what Is the proper rate to charge
private consumers for nas supplied, it is \
nevertheless entitled to payment for the
gas which it has furnished the city for
its public buildings at the rate fixed by
your honorable board on April IT. l v .<:<. and
which is the same rate contained In the
contract that was ratified and approved
on the :!d day of June, 1898, by his Honor
the Mayor.
Your honorable body must, certainly ad
mit that no gas company can serve gas
Indefinitely without compensation. There
fore this company respectfully requests
that without delay you authorize the pay
ment of its bills thai are due anil that
you assure it that Its bills becoming due
i'or gas supplied by it to the public build
ings will be paid, as it does not wish to ;
continue furnishing gas under existing >
circumstanci s.
In another portion of its communica
tion the gas company calls attention to
.the fact that the Supervisors adopted
resolutions and the Mayor approved
them authorizing both gas companies ;
to furnish gas for certain public build
ings at the rate of $1 50 per thousand, .
for the period of two years from June. :
1898; and that in the face of this ap
proval, although advised by the City
and County Attorney that the Supervis
ors had the power to authorize the pay
ment of the gas company's bills, neither
the Mayor nor Supervisors have taken
any steps to arrange for their payment.
On the heels of this communication
came the visit yesterday to the Mayor
of the gas company representatives,
and the result will be the conferen< c
this afternoon, from which bc-th sides,
or as many sides as there are. expect I
much good. As, the matter stands, it is
asserted that the Mayor is determined
that, unless some compromise can be
effected, he will refuse to call together
the Hoard of Supervltors next Monday.
It is certain, toe. thai the majority of
the Board oi Supervisors, now satisfied
that the resolution under which they ;
held their meeting last Monday is legal.
will meet aeain next Monday, pursuant
to adjournment, ready to transact
whatever business may come before
them.
Providing the stand they take is tho
legal one, it will make little difference
tn the majority whether or not tho
Mayor calls a meeting of the board i'ny
next Monday. There are seven of them
â â i quorum for the transaction of busi
ness. It does, however, make a great
deal of difference to the Mayor and the
minority. If. as stated hefore, the reso
lution dug up last Monday is of legal
font-, meetings held under it and busi
ness transacted at such meetings are
binding. As a consequence, if the
Mayor and the minority remain away,
their absence will be taken up willful
and they must take the consequent
These consequences, as lias been
pointed out to the Mayor by more than
one member of the minority, will be ap
parent, if by his absence and the ab
sence of the minority it is made possi
ble for the majority to transact, with
out a protest, business which may be
prejudicial to the puhlic interest. It
is pretty generally understood that the
majority of the Supervisors are in favor
of arriving at some settlement with
the gas companies. Their action in vot
ing for a $1 60 gas rate shows that their
Views as to recompense very nearly
meet those of the gas companies. Their
public utterances since that time indi
cate that they are ready thÂ» moment
the way is clear to put their views into
resolutions which will become binding
on the city and its rate payers.
If there is no opposition manifested
at the meeting next Monday, it will
be held- against the Mayor and the
minority that, had they been present
Iheir protest might have been effective j
in securing a lower rate than was put
through. The Mayor and the minority
realize this position, and, partly for this
reason, the conference set this after
noon was agreed upon. At it the ques
tion of the payment of the bills of the
gas company will be aiscussed, and, if
a compromise is effected, it is almost
certain that the full board will he called
to meet next Monday, with the belief
that the vexed gas rate question will
lie settled on a basis satisfactory to all
until such time as competition and not

companies' rates to the level of the
