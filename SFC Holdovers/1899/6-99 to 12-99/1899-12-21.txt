STANFORD T'NIVKRSITY. Dec. 20.â
ThÂ« Stanford University gee and man

a result thÂ« re may b*Â» no vacation trip

GREAT BRITAIN HAS THE WAR FEVER
AND A VAST ARMY WILL
SOON BE LANDED IN SOUTH AFRICA.
NEW YORK, Dec. 20,â A special to the World from the British camp at Chieveley, Natal, dated December 16, says: There was
heavy firing this morning at Ladysmith. Colonel G. M. Bullock of the First Devonshires, three of his officers and forty men were taken
prisoners by Boers while flying a flag of truce and looking for their wounded.
LONDON, Dec. 20. â There is no fresh news from General Giitacre. but the latest telegrams at the War Office report that on Mon
tk'tv General French engaged the enemy near Jasl'ontein fÂ»rm. The I s ew Zcalanders occupied the farm and adjacent hill unopposed. The
Boers advanced to the attack, but General French, having made *i reconno ssance to the north of their position, retired his force. The
New Zealanders are reported as having been most steady under a hot Boer fire at short range.
The Daily .News has the following dispatch from Cape Town, dated Saturday, December 16:
â¢The Boers intend to make a big stand at Stormberg, and are massing a great force at the abandoned British camp. One com
mando of 2000 consists chiefly of rebel Dutch."

LONDON, Dec. 2i â
Ominous silence continues j
regarding Generals Buller
and Methuen. Some interesting
details of the battle of Colenso
have been received to the effect
that the fight was a drawn bat
tle and that British troops are
keeping an eye on the aban
doned guns, while one tele
gram records their recovery by a
party of volunteers. But there
was no confirmation of these re
ports. The names of 137 non
commissioned officers and men '.
who were killed have been for
warded instead of 117 as at first
reported.
There was no fresh news from
; General Gatacrc.
General French had another
encounter with the Boers on
Tuesday, when the New Zealand-
I ers distinguished themselves un
der a heavy fire.
The latest dispatch of Saturday
I from M odder River refers to an
exchange of shots between the â 
I Boers and General Methuen's
outposts. The Boers still hold
their position at Magersfontein.
The town of Jacobsdal is also in
; their hands.
But little credence is placed in
the report that the guns lost by
the British were not captured by
the Boers. Had the story been
true General Buller must have
referred to it. Buller's artillery
cannot now muster much more
than thirty guns, while the cap
tured British weapons have no
doubt been mounted in the Boer
lines and can be used, since the
ammunition wagons seem to
have been lost with them.
Remarkable, indeed, were the
scenes in Pall Mall yesterday.
Of late at the War Office we
have grown accustomed to see
ladies in magnificent toilets,
wives, mothers and sisters of offi
cers at the front, and modestly
clad relations of soldiers elbow
ing each other, all with the same
anxiety depicted in their faces
and the same heaviness of heart.
It was in the center hall and out
side in the streets that the scene
yesterday was quite -new. In
stead of the usual war news
, seekers bands of stalwart, ath
i letic, big-boned young men were

assembled. They were of a'
build which showed them do be <Â»i
a race accustomed to live an out
door life. They had healthy
looking color in their cheeks.
All of them were well dressed,
most of them affecting a jaunty
colored waistcoat, sporting hunt
ing cravat, leather gaiters and
boots which looked more like
those made for a day's -hooting
than those which are generally
seen in swell Pall Mall. They
came in crowds; they were eager,
talked much and kept darting in
and out of the doors and pas
sages of the War Office. Many
(of them saluted Lord Chcsham
and Lord Lonsdale, who each re
mained for a considerable period.
All of these able-bodied,
sportsman-like youths differed
I from the usual crowd, inasmuch
as they were not there with the
usual question. "What new-:"
nor were their faces anxious.
Their expression was eager.
What they wanted to find out.
what they were there for, was to
know how they could get to the
war â how they could be em
bodied in England's citizen army
of irregular troops.
According to the War Office
during the day from throughout
the country came offers of ser
vice from 100,000 of yeomanry
and volunteers, all prepared to
equip themselves under the
terms of broad latitude of the rule
as to clothing, which really only
restricts them to neutral colors,
so as not to be too conspicuous
targets for Boer sharpshooters.

BIG MEN BEHIND THE
PRO-BOER MOVEMENT
CHICAGO, Dec. 20.â Peter Van Shaack, ex-president of the Holland So
ciety of Chicago, said to-day that he knows of forty-eight men who are go
ing from this city to join the Boer forces in the field, and that he expects
the movement to grow until there will be an exodus of Dutch sympathizers
from New York and other ports to South Africa. He said: "The pro-Boer
movement in this country has some big men behind itâ such men as Mayor
Van Wyck and Robert Roosevelt of New York. Of course Mayor Van Wyck
is compelled to work carefully because of his official position, but he is
nevertheless active."
vice were coming , so fast
yesterday alternoon that it was
impossible to attend to them.
They came by post, by telegraph
wire and cables from the east
and the west, Australia, Canada.
Malta and the Cape, and from al
most every region where the
British colonies flourish.
Everywhere the war fever is
visible. People thought the war
fever was great when war was de
clared, but it was nothing to
what on even- side is witnessed
to-day, and what was most re
markable is that women are just
as keen as men. Almost every
woman, be she a star in society
or on the stage, tells you with
deep yearning that she wants to
be a nurse. If men and women
were to be allowed to have their
own way just now Great Britain
would very speedily be depopu
lated and find its populace on
African soil.
The wave of enthusiasm which
is rolling all over the country is
being fanned by all public speak
ers and newspapers.
Last evening Sir Richard Tem
ple talked of an army of 175,000
men.
The War Office to-night con
siders that it can get all the men
and horses it wants. Lord
Wolseley, who has been openly
severely attacked, has completely
changed his views, and is now for
all the cavalry that can be mus
tered.
Officials in the artillery- depots
and manufactories are working
double gangs, night and day, in
strenuous efforts to get fresh
batteries to replace those taken,
while the manufacture of lyddite
shells is being rushed to its ut
most capacity.
At the army clothing depot I
the staff has been nearly doubled |
and works night and day, like all '
other departments, in getting!
khaki uniforms completed and
packed for the front.
People are really almost for
getting Christmas in the absorb- |
ing enthusiasm of war. Trades
people would be hard hit were it
not that they manage to recoup
in money spent for the enormous
number of presents to be sent out
to South Africa for officers and
men.
But altogether from to-day on
we might easily imagine that
England had commenced a new
war, much larger and more inter
esting than the first. Such is the
dominating note among the Eng
lish people this day. All say for
ward; none say enough.
The announcement that the
men of Section D of the army re
serve are to be recalled to the
colors is significant of the strain
which the present situation has
imposed upon the resources of
the regular army. The whole
army reserve consists of four
classes of sections, A, B, C and D.
Section A is a small reserve of
5000 men. Section B consists of
men who have completed their
color service and are working out
in the reserve the remainder of
their engagement. Section C
comprises men who for various
reasons have been transferred to
the reserve before completing the
normal period of service with the
colors.
Section Dis a supplemental
reserve consisting of men who on
completion of their first period of
engagement are enlisted to r*erve
for a further period of four years
in reserve, and are not liable to
be called out until after the rest
of the reserves.
The calling up of Section D is
therefore an indication t that other
sections are or very shortly will
be used up.
The total strength of the re
serves, according to the latest re
turns, was 82,005 m en. The
army in South Africa will in the
immediate future, according to
the War Office plans, be in
creased fully 50 per cent. Three
full divisions of the regular army
are now in process of arrival at
the Cape, on their way thither or
under sailing orders. Large
drafts to bring regiments already
at the front up to full war
strength to replace the wastage
caused by casualties are being
sent out.
The great force of volunteers
and yeomanry which is to be or
ganized will still further swell the
number. The total of reinforce
ments already arranged for fol
lows: Volunteers, 7000; yeo
manry, 3000; fifth division, 11,
000 (about 6000 already landed
at the Cape); sixth division, 11,
000; seventh divisic&, 11.000;
cavalry brigade. 1200; reinforc
ing drafts, 12.000; Canadians and
Australians. 2000. Total. 58.200.
Deducting casualties, these re
inforcements will bring the Brit
ish forces in South Africa to 1
000, not including the colonial
and irregular troops of Cape
Colony and Xatal, which prob
ably will number 30,000.
The action of the city of Lon
don, through the Lord Mayor
and Corporation, in resolving to
pay the entire cost of equipment
of 1000 city volunteers, entailing
an expenditure of about 100.000
pounds sterling ($500,000), is but
typical of the feeling prevailing
in England at present. From all
sections come enthusiastic replies
to the call for volunteers.

MAN! â  Pec. 3>.-Th# circum
stances surrounding the heroic
death of Major General Lawton
at San Mateo. at D o" clock Tues
day morning, show the nobility of
hi- character.
When Captain Ethelbert L. D. Hrerk
enrldge wan shot General I^iwton assisted
in taking the young officer to a small de
pression, which. It was thought, offered
sufllcient protection.
Bullets rain..! about the tall form of
General IÂ«awton as he exposed himself
above the embankment. Officers abotit
him railed the general's attention to the
fact that Filipino sharpshooters were aim-
Ing at him. They beicged him to be careful.
General Lawton resolutely replied: "I
must sÂ»Â»e what Is K>>ltiK on In the flrlnit
line." Hi then started off and had tra
versed about tifty feet, when he met bin
aids. Kin* and Fuller, returning. As they
approached him General r.awton suddenly
paled and clenched his hands.
"What Is the matter, general!" ex-
claimed King.
"I am shot through the lungs." replied
General Lawton. He pitched forward
with blood gushing from his mouth. He
did not speak again, for he was dead.
General Lawton's staff officers were
grief-strlckcn. Their sorrow is so great
that they cannot talk.
Manley Lawton, the 12-year-old son of
the general, who accompanied his father
in the entire northern campaign, stood
outside the gate of his Manila home to
night, waiting for the arrival of the body.
'â¢How I dread to xee my father dead 1 '
he exclaimed. The t was nvcr
nÂ«m*Â» with icrief when the ambulance with
a bIK (i.alr. Mai ri thundered down the
â tnet and came into view.
Mrs. Lawton wan packing up In a dazed
way. getting ready to return home with
her dead husband. Kvery one Is fearful
of thÂ» result if she breaks down.
General Otis says he feels as If by Gen
eral Law ton's death he has lost his right
arm.
BODY OF THE DEAD
GENERAL REACHES MANILA
MANILA. Dec. 3).â Major General Law
ton'* body was brought from Snn Mateo
to Manila this afternoon, his staff and a
squadron of cavalry acting as escort. It
was found necessary to bridge the river.
The funeral will take place from his
late residence here, a mansion formerly
occupied by a Spanish general. Th- body
has been placed temporarily In a vault in
El Paco cemetery, where many of the
American soldiers have been Interned, and
a guard of honor will be maintained.
When Mrs. Lawton and her four chil
dren shall have completed their arrange
ments for returning to the United State*
the remains will be taken on a transport
with an escort of officers for final Inter
ment, as it Is thought probable here. In
Arlington Cemetery.
General Lawton's death has caused uni
versal sorrow in Manila. No American
ofllcer had greater popularity among all
ranks, and in his dealings with the na-
tives he commanded their respect and
confidence to a remarkable degree. The
Mayors whom he installed In the neigh
boring towns are arranging to attend the
funeral In a body.
To Lawton's executive ability and per
sonal leadership Is chiefly due thÂ« bril
liant execution of the plan of campaign
in North Luzon, which has scattered the
insurgents from San Isiilro to the Gulf
of Lingayen. Thai section of the Island,
which had to be traversed during the very
worst season of the year, presented dif
ficulties considered by all acquainted with
It to be almost Insurmountable, but Gen
eral Lawton thoroughly covered the pro
gramme assigned him. When he reached
Tayug and found that the other division
had not arrived, he went through to Dag
upan on his own responsibility. Although
he Imposed great hardships upon his men,
he Invariably shared their lot cheerfully.
Thirteen Americans, including threÂ«
officers, were wounded In the engagemenT
at San Mateo, where General Lawton
was killed. Captain Breckenridge's
wound Is not considered dangerous, al
though the bullet penetrated his arm
and side. â¢
It is estimated that the insurgents num
bered COO, and that half of them were
armed with rifles. The Americans num
bered 1300. but the command had been
much depleted by sickness.
The wagon train found the roads Im
passable and was obliged to return.
The Insurgents retreated to the. north
east, leaving six fiend. They have other
forces near Taytay. This region al
though close to Manila, has proved the
most difficult from which to dislodge the,
enemy. It Is now reported that the In
surgents Intend to concentrate at Santa
Cruz. I^aguna province, and In the dis
trict east of Laguna de Dal.
The American secret service reports
that Agulnaldo has Joined the Mart-turn*
force.

where General Lawton met his death, has
frince the outbreak of hostilities been a
thorn in the side of the American gen

northeastward of Manila, It is a point of
Important strategical value as controlling
the head of San Mateo Valley and the en
trances to Morontr Peninsula. Us occupa
tion by the insurgents is a constant men
ace to the city's water supply, which is
obtained from San Mateo River at a
pumping station about six miles nearer to
Manila. From the pumping station runs
a pipe line eight miles into the city. The
necessity for proper and complete patrol
ling and protection of this aqueduct has
been the cause of many of the important
military movements near Manila. Its
pafety has been threatened by small
bodies of the enemy several times since
February 4. when the occupation of its
entire length was effected by a brilliant
march of the First Tennessee Regiment.
Tho flank of the body of troops guarding
the line has been frequently threatened
by the presence of insurgents in Ban Ma
teo, Marlqulna and Novatlshes. Marlquina
up to October 15 had been captured, and
as soon abandoned, eight times. San Ma
teo had been captured, the insurgents
( driven out and the place abandoned twice.
The ilrst expedition against San Mate.)
last June resulted in a severe light and
: the death of Captain Gregg, Fourth In
fantry, and several enlisted men. As re
inforcements came and tho necessary
troops could I"- spared those places were
being garrisoned. Novallchos and Morong
. were garrisoned early in September. In
October a strong force had been placed in
Mariquina, and Tuesday's movement of
General Lawton was to complete the oc
cupation of those towns, forming a pro
tective semicircle to the source of Ma
nila's water supply.

PIETERMARITZBURQ. Saturday. Dec.
16.â An eye-witness of the battle at Co
lenso states that the ammunition colu.nn
thrice attempted to get to the abandoned
field guns, but the fire was too hot. An
armored train also made an unsuccessful
attempt. A prominent feature of the
fighting was the marvelous rapidity with
which the Boers moved their heavy guns
from point to point.
BRITISH AGENTS HIRE
VETERANS IN GERMANY
BERLIN. Dec. 20.â Despite repeated Brit
ish denials, it. '-cems to be a fact that British
agents are busy In many of the rural dis
tricts in Germany hiring veterans for ser
vice in South Africa. Several well-au
thenticated cases have been reported this
week, but the following incident seems
conclusive: The District Court of Ham
burg has Just issued an order for the ar
rest of a British agent named York for
hiring a number of German peasants In
the neighborhood for military service.
Which under the imperial laws is a crim
inal offense. There is nothing, however,
to Interfere with Herr Krupp in the
manufacture of steel shells for the British
army. A local paper announces that 25,000
such shells are being made on a "rush"
order and that the men are working night
and day.

TRAIN ROBBERS GET
BUT LITTLE BOOTY
Missouri Pacific Passengers Succeed
in Secreting Their Val
uables.
OMAHA. Neb., Dec. 20.â Passengers and
trainmen who arrived on the Missouri
train, which was held up last night Just
out of Kansas City, have some thrilling
stories to tell of their experiences. ThÂ«
only ones who were robbed were tho oc
cupants of the Pullman, and they do not
think the job netted the robbers over
$150 and several gold watches and other
Jewelry.
There were three robbers, two of whom
wore masks, while the third, who ap
peared to be the leader, was unmasked.
They stood the trainmen up by them
selves and refused to take anything from
them. One man saved $150 by slipping; his
roll down Inside the waist of his little boy.
Many other passengers secreted their
valuables and money.
When the Job waa completed the robbers
compelled the porter of the ear to pull the
air brake and stop the train. As they
left the car they warned the passenger*
not to get off or open tho windows, "for,"
said, one of the robbers, "we would hate
to be forced to kill anybody for the small
amount we got."
The robbers remarked that they did not
see how so poor a lot of passengers
could afford to ride in a sleeping-car. As
soon as the train stopped the robbers dis
appeared in the darkness.

Special Dispatch to Tt.- Can.
SAN* RAFAEL. Dec 20.â 1f the allega
tions made by his children and the neigh

living about five miles north of town on
the Petaluma road who would cut a
rather graceful figure as farmer for the
State, with credits tor good behavior ln-
Ete&d of ducats. The name of the man
who is alleged to have treated his off
spring fo Inhumanly that a daughter Is
now suffering from nervous prostration Is
John Hoffman, and If the threats lately
made by those who have become familiar
with his acts are carried out that name
will in a few days ornament a volume of
record kept by the Marin County Society
lor the I'revontion of Cruelty to Children.
Nine years ago Hoffman's wife was con
firmed to an Insane asylum, whero she
died bhortly afterward. When tho oldest
boy. liernurd, was asked if the lather's
treatment was not responsible for his
mother's sad end ho hung his hood and
remained silent. On the b^ubject of the
wrongs done himself and his brother and
flsler he was not co reticent, and related
a few Incidents that :;:..>!â¢.; his hearers
bhudder.
"Father ha* been In the habit of drink
ing a tjoixl deal," he said, "and when he
came homo intoxicated would beat us all
with anything he could lay hiÂ« hands on.
A few nvnths ago he came home and be
cause his <Mnr.er was not ready he grasped
my plsier Emma and. dragging her to the
Hove, thrust her head Into the oven. Th*
hair was burm*<fc off the toy of her head
and hus never grown Mnee then.
"About fix weeks ago he chased Emma
around the hou.*Â©. and when he caught
her he slashed her across" the wrists with
a tuK-ket-knife. Both are now scarred
wlxto they camo in contact with the
knl re.
"My plater finally became a sufferer
from nervous prostration and we had to
*end her to my aunt. Mrs. Cart Schenck.
who lives at 1677 Twelfth street, Oakland.
Fhe returned a few days ago, and would
bÂ« all rlÃht if it were not for father
i.appinjf ut her all the time. He was so
Kcarod when she became, sick after he cut
her with the knife that ho has not a?aln
laid hands on her.
â¢'Father used to beat me. and my
ynun*?er brother, Kmlle. every day, but
we have grown too larce for him to
hundlo us now. Two yoars afro he was
thrown out of a busffv while drunk and
broke his leg in two places. 1 would like
to ru to Fome place lo work or send my
brother, for one of us will have, to stay
and look after father. Yea, he has treated
us pretty roughly, but still he. Is our
father, njid I dnnt want to desert him In
his old ace. I am afraid, thouÃh, that we
will ha\Â« to send Km ma back to Oak
land."

Two features of the celebration are Bat
tery C. Third Artillery, and the Nevada
State Band. Hattery C Is an historic bat
tery, having ligured In the Mexican war.
At liuena Vista its arrival turned what
seemed to be defeat into victory. Later
It whs known as Brake's Battery. The
Nevada Band gave a concert this after
noon from the porch of the representa
tion of the Urst State Capitol erected for
the Jubilee.
A â  liter of attraction Is the State Cap

adorned the original building.
To-morrow morning the grand street
parade will take place. In the evening
there will be another entertainment at the
Auditorium. Friday night there will be
a grand ball at the Courthouse.
The ceremonies opened with the plant
ing of a young gipantea sequoia in the
City Hall Park. The Fifth Regiment
Band marched to the place, followed by
several hundred people, most of whom
were pioneers and Mexican veterans. The
â pot where the tree was planted is but
a short distance from where the first
State Capitol stood.
Mayor Martin and Major Sherman, fol
lowed by some fifty Mexican war veter
ans, Including ex-Governor Bidwell,
gathered around the tree. A selection by
the band was played while the tree was
being placed in position. Mayor Martin
then read the following address:

Three cheers for the Jubilee and Mayor
Martin were then given. A Email parcel
of earth gathered from Bunker Hill. Lex
ington, Mount Vernon and other historic
epots was passed around among the vet
erans and each deposited some of the dust
around the tree.
Professor Charles H. Allen read an orig
inal poem entitled "The Sequoia." as fol
lows .
More centuries at â > than man can tell
liish on a mountain in this western land
A little seed came, fluttering as It fell.
And soon was burled In the shifting sand.
Wakened to life by Â«unshtxie and by ahower.
Its roots crew downward, deep In Mother
Earth.
The atÂ«tn s(>rang upward, as by ma(1o power â
Thus our Sequoia, the r&utea. bad Us birth.
Nursed by Dame Nature's ever fostering hand.
The tender shoot tuok on a tree-like form.
Developing a strength that could withstand
The blasts Of winter, the tierce mountain
storm.
Its pray-green foliage from each passing cloud
Condensed the moisture lor the thirsty
sround. â¢
The summer breezes through its branches
soughed.
And here a genial home for upward growth
It. found.
Long cycles passed. Its growth not yet com
plete.
It stretched yet upward toward the source
of llsht.
The fin and pines teemed pigmies at Its feet,
AÂ» thus It stood In i!iajÂ«-nt> and might.
Fruitage at length ;ifi"-*Â»"'i upon each bough.
JJy winds its seeds were scattered far aud
wide.
These found a boOM on mountain u>p and brow.
And struKgliriK, made their Way a-down its
lUCKed sides.
But when the Ice King reigned the glacier's
. path
Bwcpt 'round the summits, leaving there
alone
The groat Sequoias; and the Storm King's
wrath
Disturbed them not. high on their mountain
throne.
This tree Is California'sâ s Its fame.
Its only native horn* upon our fhore.
Two nations claimed the honor of Its nassÂ«,
But Wellington and Wusninsiun un ..* jrd
no more.
Our sixth decade of Statehood has begun;
We plant, to-day, this fair Sequoia tree,
Memorial and symbol, both in one
Of what our State has been and what shall
be.
Around Its roots, gathered with patient care
Earths have been strewn from - many a field
of fame;
Nature' grand alchemy shall these prepare
To make one mighty tree. It brooks not
whence they came.
Aril thus our State, peopled from many lands.
Shall, Ilkâ the tree, be unified and strong.

A salute by Battery C, Third Artillery,

SIGNBOARDS GONE
FROM ROSS VALLEY
Guerrilla Methods of Warfare Soon
Force an Advertising Firm
to Capitulate.
SAN ANSELMO. Dec. 20.â residents
of the region embracing this place and
Ross Valley have won their fight against
the advertisers who persisted In erecting
unsightly signboards along the line of the
railway, where they stared passengers) In
the face until their dreams were troubled
with visions of ghosts garbed In yellow,
red. purple and green. The battle was
bitter, though brief, and the victory Is
decisive.
Six weeks ago somebody took a noc
turnal ramble along the line of these signs
and cut partly through the braces with
a saw. When the Ilr.it heavy wind blew
the signs were "dead- ones." Agents of
Slebo & Green visited the region and put
the signs in place again, but a few nights
ago the braced were again cut and failed
to stand against the gales that sweep
down the valley at this time of the year.
Then the enemy capitulated, realizing
that It would take an expensive patrol
system to conduct the war against such
guerrilla methods. It Is stated that the
advertising firm was paid well to remove
the signs, but In any event they have been
carted away.
Ross Valley and San AnseJmo form one
of the most popular suburban residence
regions In the State, from which all signs
of the busy marts of trade are strictly pre
cluded. The signboards were an eyesore
and had to go. though none there be who
will admit having a hand In the incidents
that led to the victory.
CARTRIDGES IN THE FIRE.

later a deafening explosion followed, tear

senseless. The doors, windows and some
furniture were damaged. There must
have been several cartridges* In the fire.
Mr Requa was shot three times In the
head and face and his wife wa.i struck
by shot In the body. The wounds are
very painful, but not necessarily danger
ous. The cartridges were probably j;irr. 1

SUPPORTS SAMOAJf TREATY.
Senate Committee Authorizes a Fa
vorable Report.
WASHINGTON. Dec 20lâ The Senate
Committee on. Foreign Relations to-day
authorized a favorable report u?on the
two treaties negotiate with Great Brit
ain and Germany for the dissolution of the
tripartite a*?rÂ»-Â«-ment for the control of the
Samoan Islands. Senator Bacon, ode of
the new Democratic members of the com
mittee, was the only opponent of the
treaty, and he did not seek to delay the
reporting at it. to the Senate. His oppo
iltlon was directed toward the acquisition
by this country of the island of Tutulla
and was based upon the contention that
the consent of the islanders should be
first secured. He V lift met en thlt propo
::j >t. with the statement that the natlve3
WtX* nothing more than wandering trtbea.
and trith the argument that the Unlte.j
State* could not afford to forego the cp-
IÂ»ortunity to secure complete control of
Pago Pago harbor, which this treaty
gave. ".

THE PAN FRANCISCO CALL. THURSDAY. DECEMBER 21. 1899.
DISTINGUISHED DISCIPLE OF
THE LATE HENRY GEORGE
TOM L. JI.H>SON.
THE PalacÂ« Hotel has a distlnsraished guest in the person of Tom L.
Johnson, the famous single-tax advocate. wh& arrived there yesterday
with his wife and family fron: Cleveland. Ohio.
Mr. Johnson's tr.p to the-^cas! Is merely one cf ...
â*> will depend larg-ely on the as.. cf amusement and rest this State
has to offer -..m.
Mr. Jch.-.son's career reads like a romance. Millionaire, statesman, poli
tician and philanthropist, he has achieved in all â¢â -.-.. dissimilar
pursuits a reputation that places him among the really remarkable men of
the century.
About forty years ag-> Mr. Johnson gathered up his bag of savings and.
moving frcm his Kentucky hcmeÂ«tead in the country, bought a male street
car line in a Kentucky town. The road prospered and the young financier
sc'.d it at a profit and moved to Ir.d:ar-apolis, .---.. his capital
In the same way on a mere pretentious scale. The second venture was as
good as the â -" and be eventually sold cut to a syndicate of Chicago cap
italists at a profit that made him a fairly well-to-do man.
Frcm Ir.dlanapo'.ls Mr. Johnson wer.t to C!ev-lard. where he engaged asTUn
in the etreet railway tu^iness ar.4 soon amassed a fortune that needed" six
figures to carry it on the commercial register.
In Cleveland he became converted to the thecry of single tax f'cm read
ing seme works cf Henry George and entered politics on the principles !â¢!
cnlcated by that famous writer. H* was tendered the nomination for the
Governorship of Ohio on the Democratic ticket, but declined running late- fn-
Ccrgresi In a district almost moasly Republican and beating out* Or
lando J. Hodre. or.c. ef the strongest men that the P.epubUcan party could
put cgairst him. '
Mr. Jchnson tome time ag 0 decided to retire from active commercial It's
and to devote himself to the propagation of the doctrines of Henry George
He has continued true to his determination, but the immense interests ne
control* and his numerous charities take up about all the time he has to
spare frcm his missionary work.
FRANCE APPROVES
OF NEW TREATY
Says It Is an Evidence of
Friendship.
EpecUl Dlspwch to The Call.
PARIS. Dec Bft.â A bill submitting the
Franco- American reciprocity treaty to the
approval cf the French Parliament was
introduced to-day in the Chamber of Dep
uties. The Government, in an elaborate
preamble, makes a point of setting forth
the "kindly disposition of the American
Government, which has enabled the nego
tiations to be brought to a successful con
clusion." expatiates upon the great stimu
homm the treaty will give to commerce be
tween the two countries.
The preamble goes on to explain that the
treaty is the result of two years' work.
It sayÂ» that, while pressed to retaliate
against the restrictions of the DingUy
tariff, the Government deemed a resort to
diplomacy preferable. In view of "our
traditional sympathies for the republic of
the United States and due consideration
for our economic interests."
It then recapitulates the main points of
the provisional arrangement of May 5.
W, which opened the way for further ne
gotiations, as French Imports Into the
United States relieved from the tariff. in
creased yj per cent.
Such American productions as castlroa.
leather articles and machine tools "in
which American manufacturers possess a
distinct superiority ... . which constitute
a danger to French industry." -.ire. thÂ«
preamble points out still excluded from
the minimum tariff Moreover, agricul
tural and cattle products are similarly ex
cluded "in order to protect the French
from- formidable American competition."
â¢This resuit," says the preamble, "Is all
the more important because. Mr. Kasson
made pressing demands on behalf of
American agriculture. The French Em
: *--.. .â¢ r was not only abie to resist them.
but even obtained useful reductions in
favor of French agricultural products ex
ported to the United States, such as olive
oil and preserved vegetables." ..-. â 
After pointing out that France under
the treaty ootains the unique concession
of favored nation treatment, and describ
ing this as a ''peculiarly gracious conces
sion." the preamble compares the re
spective advantages obtained by the con
tracting parties, saying: "Only 4 per cent
ol American products, value 25.CÂ«>j.UÂ»
francs, benefit, the American gain being
1,077,41) francs annually, while over 53 per
cent of French products, value 155,&40,CÂ«JQ
francs, benefit, the French gain being
*,Z&2*\ francs annually."
After particularly calling attention to
the important fact that the concessions
obtained by France are exclusive and
should tremendously increase French ex
ports, while, at the same time the treaty
Is so arranged as to prevent an American
invasion of French markets, the preamble
concludes as follows:
"The Government at th* White House.
in signing with us this treaty, has shown
their desire to reserve to French com
merce the first fruits of the tariff conces
sions which the Dingley bill authorized
to be granted to foreign powers.
"This action gives the treaty a value
it would be impossible to misunderstand
and makes this document a work which
should draw closer at the same time the
economic relations of the two peoples and
the political affinities of the two repub
lics.

JURY INDICTS
MRS. MANSFIELD
Arrested on Three Libel
Charges.
Siweial D4Â«r*teh to Tb* C*a.
HOLLISTER. Dec S).-The Grand Jury
to-day returned three Indictment! or {
criminal libel ââ _â -â :â :--:: Mans- Â»
field. based upon three anonymous letters j
written during the year attacking the ,
chastity of Mrs. E. E. Conrad, noble ;
rrand of Rebekah Lodge of Holilster. |
One letter was written to --?â  Agr.-w.
cc to Mrs. H. XT. Scott and one to Mrs.
jC Tonn. Mrs. Mansfield denied the au
thorship of the letters, but evidence, of '
Experts KyUca and Ames affected the
Jury agi!r.!t her. Jud*e Docllng fixed
bonds at CCCO. which were furnished, and
the arraignment was set for Saturday aft
ernoon.
The trial lr bound to bÂ« sensational and
nasty. The parties have been neighbors f
for fourteen years. About five years ago I
the receipt of anonymous letters assailing
the ciiajstity of his wife and accusing his
children of theft caused another neighbor ;
named Schlll to ahoot one. KaUni>wsky.;
then Â«>rrip4nyÂ»d by Conrad, whom be gus-1
p*cted of wrltinp thÂ© letters.
--ScsiU then t<x-k a dose of x>ol?on and
er.dwT his troubles. - "
Since then Mrs. Conrad has b*er i -
slstently vlHSed by the anonymous writer,
who sent letters to about every prominent j
lady In HolUster. Seme time aco Mrs. '
Maasfl*!d. II Is alleged, commenced to
write letters to herself to divert suspi
cion arid these were secured by District
Attorney Hudner and by the experts pro
nounced Identical with the other*. An r.
â¢an* Jealousy at the prosperity of Uie-
Conrads seems to be at the bottom of the
matter.
Mrs. Mansfield scoff* at her accuser and
Is cool and Indifferent in court. Her nus
bard believes in her innocence and an- I
nounces that he will spend every dollar
be has in her defense. Society In Hollls
ter is much torn u^ over the scandal that
Is bound 10 come to the surface.
QUAY'S FRIENDS APPEAL
TO M'KINLEY FOR AID
Attempting to Enlist the Support of
the Administration on Behalf
of the Senator.
WASHINGTON. Dec Â».â Senator Pen
rose" and Representative i'.lr.^ham called
upon President McKinley to-day, and It
is generally understood their mission was
to enlist the services of the administration
in behalf of ex-cenator Quay. This is a
manifest indication of weakness, as the
friends of Quay have persistently assert
ed that they were assured of sufficient
votes to seat .m.
While it Is known that the President is
friendly to Quay, it cannot be stated to
what extent the executive will exert suffi
cient influence to have him seated in the
Senate.
Postmaster General Smith was a visitor
at the White House to-day and there Is
reason to r resume that the Pennsylvania
Senatorial contest was discussed.
There Is a rumor to-night that the Sen
ate Committee on Privileges and Elec
tions will withhold its report until it is
quite definitely ascertained how the Sen
ate as a whole will vote on Quay's case
Quay is confident of being seated, but his
opponents are just as sanguine of his de
feat. .

MC ALarket at.. Room 1. 1
|
Guatemala with his bride, a San Fran
cisco luuy, about twenty yearn ago and
engaged in coffee planting- iiÂ« was suc
cesstui in ills business ventures and
sought an investment for the surplus
earnings of his plantation. Remembering
his Id friend lates, he sent him from
time to time various sums to Invest In
California real estate. In all some 120,000
was remitted. Among Lambert's papers
there wus nothing to snow tliat Yatt had â 
ever rt-eeived a cent of the money or that
the deceased had any interests in this
city.
After his death in San Francisco last
January his will was offered for probate
ii. the Guatemalan courts. In the mean
time his brother in this city applied for
letters testamentary on the estate, and in
his petition set forth that the only prop
erty owned by the deceased within the
Jurisdiction of the California courts were
a few personal effects of tall value.
During the progress of probating the es- \
tate in Central America a letter was re- ,
ceived from C. M. Fates announcing that
he had invested a fortune In real estate
for the deceased in the vicinity of San
Francisco and that he desired to turn It
over to the proper parties designated by
the court. To the widow and her attorney
the news came as a complete surprise.
The estate in Guatemala was heavily in
cumbered, and when the debts were paid
little would have been left, but the infor
mation from Yates made the estate a
valuable one.
Tlure was nothing to prevent Mr. Yates
from retaining possession of the property.
It was not mentioned In Lambert's will, i
! and among his effect* there was nothing ,
to show â  ..it he bad ever made Invest
ments here. All of the deeds were in the
name of Yates. The property consists of
valuable possessions on Seventh street in
this city and several farms in the most ,
fertile sections of the State.
The story that Lambert had led a dual
life that was exposed by the provisions
of his will Is not borne out by the facts.
, The woman who accompanied him to this
; city last January was not his wife. She Is
Josephine Marina, who was his reputed
mistress, and Is at present In Paris with
her two children, whom Lambert ac
knowledges in his will.
Mrs. Lumb'Tt Is in Guatemala manag
ing her late husband's coffee plantations.
CALIFORNIA BANKS SAFE.
No Danger of Feeling the Eastern
Money Market Troubles.
Rank Commissioner Barrm states that
the presom flurry and money excitement
in thÂ« Kast has not one chance. in .1 thou
sand of bdng felt In this State. The re
cent call for statments of the business ol
the banks has brought forth reports that
Bhow that the financial standing of the
hanklnr; establishments of California is
liettor than It has been for years.. In
truth, one of the complaints of the bank
ers Is that they have too much money on
hand. In other words, money is cheap.
At the last reports there was about $32.
tion.o<>o in cash rÂ»n hand, against about
1256,000.000 of deposits. Since that report
the Increase has been very material, the
majority of the banks of the State car
rying over 40 per cent cash. Besides cash.
Commissioner Barrett says that the banks
have plenty of collateral and no end of
securities of the best kind, large blocks of
Government bonds being among the secur
ities. Whatever may result from the
financial Hurry and uncertainty in the
Eastern money market there is no danger
of it being felt hero.

elers who make California their home,
will defy Friday next week by holding
their annual meeting on Friday. De
cember 29. A call is out for the meeting,
, which will take place in Balboa Hall,
Native Sons" building. The annual rfporta
, will be submitted and officers will be
elected for the. ensuing: year. in connec
tion with the. rail for th.' annual meeting
notice ims been sent to the I1'*)I I *) members

John Jay Baunsartner.
In addition to the officers at the annual
1 meeting there will be elected a board of
directors and committees on railroad and

ThÂ«- past year has presented some new
considerations to the travelers. The con
solidation of business. Interests in the
East had the effect to throw out of em
ployment many men who had been long
on the road. Probably all matters of in
terest to the travelers will be discussed at
the annual meeting. The showing to bo
made as to numbers Is that there has
been a gain of about 2000 members In the
past year in the national association.
Th< annual banquet Is under the direc
tion of Harry E. Diggles, E. J. Warnecke
and D. Edwards. The programme has
not bÂ«-en fully made up yet. There will

MESSENGER BOYS AS
VAUDEVILLE ACTORS
ENTERTAINMENT OF THE STAN-
FORD SOCIAL CLUB.
Nothing Slow About the Lads When
It Came to Furnishing Amuse
ment for Their iFriends.
Th*rÂ« was nothing slow about the
:n I'nion Telegraph messenger
boys last evening, at least among those
who form the Stanford Social Club. This
orpanizatlon is composed of those who
during the most of the time wear the
uniforms of the telegraph company. A
V<-ur ago they decided to organize a so
cial body, with the laudable aim and ob
ject of promoting sociability and in
tellectual Improvement lit their ranks.
In casting about for a name, they remem
bered the kindness of Mrs. Jane Stan
ford, who had previously shown her re-
card for the messenger boys of this city
l>y taking them into her home and giving
them a banquet such as might have
tempted the highest in the land. The
lady readily pave her permission for her
young friends to use her name for the
club. Once a year the lads "turn them
selves loose" for a good time, in a digni
fied manner, of course, and both socials
have been a success.
The entertainment last evening held
in Union-squaro Hall, was all' that
COtgd b^ desired. The hÂ«U was writ fitted
with the members of the fraternity and
their friends, and none went away with
out a word 01 prasle for the masterly
manner In which the long, programme of
music, song*, recitations, fancy dancing
and cakewalks was carried out. While
the majority of the performers were
amateurs, there were- several profes
sionals on the boards and not a few of
the members of the service. One of the
principal events of the evening was a
one-act sketch entitled "Anything Goes "
the production of Leoni Frankhardt, 'a

HOMES OF THREE
FAMILIES THROWN
IN DEADLY PERIL
Dastardly Work of an
Incendiary.
FRAME BUILDING SET ON FIRE
Fire Marshal Towe and the Police
Endeavoring to Get a Clew to
the Fiend, With Small
Hope of Success.
The dastardly work of an incendiary in
attempting to burn down a two-story
frame building on the northeast corner of
Fifth and Clara streets was brought to
the attention of Fire Marshal Towe yes
terday and he at once placed himself in
communication with the police to get
their aid in obtaining a clew to the per
petrator of the crime.
The building ib an old one. The ground
floor Is occupied as a butcher shop, and in
the upper floors the families of Mrs. En
wright, Mrs. O'Leary and Mrs. Smith
live. â¢ There is only one means of egress
and Ingress to. the three families by a
stairway leading irom Fifth street. At
Hi'- bottom ill- i hi* stairway tnero is a
ooor opening on to the sidewalk.
About - 0 clock last baturuay morning
a passtr-by noticed smoke issuing
ihrougn the bottom of me door. lie
opened the door, and when lie saw the
stairway on nre he ran into the middle of
the street and yelled "Fire, tin-." His
t-houts awakened James Uiley. who rooms
with Mrs. Enwrlght, and he rushed from
his bedroom to the top of the stairway.
He aroused the other inmates, and with
the use of several bucketful* of water the
flames were extinguished.
An Investigation showed that some one
had placed a large wooden box filled with
wood and paper and saturated with coal
oil at the foot of the stairway and had set
it on fire, the door hiding him from the
observation of any stray pedestrian. What
object the incendiary could have is a mys
tery, as the building Is not Insured. The
Fire Marshal Is Inclined to think that it
was the work of S. crank, as he has had
experience with that class on several pre
vious occasions.
If the lire had got any headway the
stairs would have been destroyed, cutting
off the only mode of escape for the in
mates, who were all asleep at the time.
Their lives wjt.- unquestionably saved by
the opportune discovery of the smoke by
the passer-by. Every effort will be made
I to find the llend. although there is now
small hope of doing so. If the Fire â .-
i shal bad been notified earlier the chance
of detection would have been all the
greater.
ELIZA MILLER HAS
FILED HER ACCOUNT
MORE ESTATE IS RAPIDLY
BEING SETTLED.
Early Next Month Judge Coffey Will
Hear an Application for Dis
tribution and Will Set
tle the Claims.
Mrs Eliza M. Miller, administratrix of
the estate of the late A. P. More, filed
her final account In Judge Coffey's court
yesterday. An application for distribu
tion of the. estate has been made, but Mrs.
Millers attorney said that in his opinion
the estate could not be distributed until
the claim of 11. Clifford More for $13,670
had been settled. Judge Coflfey said that
he did not see anything to delay distribu
tion, as Lrf-land Stanford's estate had been
distributed while there was still outstand
ing v contingent liability of $200,000. He
did not think the plea sufficient and on
January 4 the petition will be heard and
tho account tiled settled.
In her account Mr.-*. Miller sets forth
that the cash on hand at the date of
the second annual account amounted to
$35,241 37. Since that time this amount has
dwindled, owing to many payments for
labor and expense of maintaining Im
provements on Santa Kona Island. In ad
dition to these expense! Mrs. Miller's fees
as administratrix amount to $'.C 4" and At
torneys J. B. Mhoon an>l ('. A. Storke
have been awarded $7<Â«Â«i attorneys' fees.
Continuing the administratrix says that
she has now on band all of the property
contained in thÂ«- Inventory, apprais.-i at
$74i,":<Â» S, except M>me fencing, valued at
$500, which has l><-eii sold; some livestock,
worth $1-0; 10S1 hales of wool, appraised at
j.'C-mj 08, and -*:> hales, appraised at
J'.IM Sl The claim of the estate against
John P. More for $76,000 has been com
promised by the transfer by John V.
M..r- t.> th.t administratrix all of hla In
â¢rest In the estate of A. P. More, which
was appraised at $M'.34n. All of the real
property, valued at $511,202 79, Is In good

THRASHED BY WAITERS.
John Riley, a Sailor, Made a Mistake
in Trying to Clean Out a Jap
anese Restaurant.
John Riley. a sailor with his head cov
ered with a red handkerchief and several
contusions on his face, appeared Id Judge
MogAll'fl court yesterday on a charge of
dl.-uirbing the peace, and Nino Kichl, a
Japanese waiter, also appeared on a
charge of battery upon Riley.
Riley went into the Oriental restaurant,
1."4 S.oond street, Tuesday night about 6
o'clock, where all meals^are marked at 10
cents. He* ordered soup, and afttr tinish
ing it he ordered another plateful. Then
he ordered two soft boiled eggs. He ten
dered a dime at the counter, but was
asked for 5 cents more for the extra plate
ful of Houp. He refused to pay and of
fered to light the whole establishment.
Six waiters attacked him with soup tu
reens and other weapons and ho was
thrown out. During the struggle two
panes of glass in the door, valued at $2 50.
Wen broken. Police whistles wt-re blown
and a crowd gathered. Riley harangued
the crowd and secured their sympathy.
and If Policemen Say and Beach had not
appeared the Japanese restaurant would
pmbably have been wrecked.
Riley told the Judge that he did not
order "the second plate of soup, and be
sides, he did not like the way his mtal
was served, as it was rushed at him, his
f-n^s having been thrown into his soup.
Miss* Yuna Yanagisana, the daughter of
tin- proprietor of Xhe restaurant, testified
that Kiley when in th<> restaurant al
ways wanted to show off his pugilistic
ability and started In to beat everybody.
Be did order the two plates of soup and
would not pay for them. The two offi
cers also testified that Riley was a nuis
ance in the restaurant.
Riley agreed to pay the extra nickel
and $1 toward paying for the broken
panes, and the Judge dismissed both
cases.

INTERVENTION PRECEDENTS.
See of the Boers, though
using only one-third of their military resources,
* â * there is a growing feeling that England will
p.iir. by accepting intervention now, before things get
worse. Of course the Erithh feeling of conquest is
stubborn and the prize of a wholly British South
Africa is a large one. The empire pleads the preser
vation of its interests by building the Cape to Cairo
railroad on its own soil, and that plea makes an im
pression u;;on the world's commercial instincts. But
England has di>rcgardcd similar pleas made by others.
The far sight of Bonaparte detected the ultimate
policy of Russia, and he dreaded the development of
power that would follow the appearance of Russia
in an open seaport. After Moscow he said that Eng
land would some day regret his failure to confine
Russia to winter frozen waters. When the last
Russo-Turkish war ended in the Ottoman defeat
tftcr the Balkan campaign and Constantinople was
at the mercy of "Adam Zad, the bear," England se
cured a concert of the powers, rescued Turkey and
drove Ru'^ia back upon the ice. The commercial
and political interests of Russia required that she
should realize the fruits of her victory, that she
should have the Sea of Marmora and equal rights in
the Mediterranean. But as this was opposed to Brit
ish pofrcy it was denied by the treaty of Berlin, and
England defeated Russia without righting her. Then
Russia resumed that laborious pressure eastward
which has ended by her emergence in Manchuria and
the possession 01 a coast that makes upon open
water. Now, granting that England can whip the
Boers finally, a concert of the Continental power has
exactly the fame pretext for intervention between her
and the fruit* of her victory that she had for curbing
Russia. Any access of her power in Africa is th;
strengthening of her power everywhere, and as her
presence everywhere is I menace to her rivals, it is
difficult to find grounds for objection to a final con
cert, which will in^t that she must deny herself the
enjoyment of her South African prey.
The sentiment of the world is with the Boers, for a
variety of reasons. The American people support
them because we should stand with unbroken front
against the destruction of republics by monarchies.
Other nations support them because of opposition to
the general policy of Great Britain, and it will be
attributed to cowardice if the world permits the for
cible annexation of the two republics. This being all
admitted, the friendliest act toward Great Britain will
be such timely intervention as will prevent a fruitless
conquest and return the whole issue between her and
the republics to diplomatic discussion and ultimate
arbitration. It may be laid with force that the Mon
roe doctrine restrains the United States from inter
ference But our own thirst for conquest has so frac
tured that doctrine that to plead it against an effort
to save republican government in South Africa would
excite derision. We say without hesitation, though
it may be merely en the plane of selfishness, that the
administration at Washington would make a good
stroke in domestic politics if it would cancel
the bad effect of Mr. Choatc's too flamboyant ora-
Tory toy offering just such intervention. It might
make no friendi I r.t in England, but
it would add greatly to the list in America.
We have other self-interests to plead. Recent
everts in the financial world are a flashlight on the
fiscal situation. The monetary' difficulties of England
put upon New York a streÂ«s that was eased only by
the pouring of $21,000,000 into Wall street. Berlin
the jar, and hardly a bourse in Europe escaped.
If these bad signs are set in the financial sky by an
I weeks' war, the effect of a protracted cam
paign may well rouse the most somber anticipations.
The interests of the financial and commercial world
require peace, not war. Therefore England has not
â¢ -If alone to consider, but must think of the wider
interests of mankind.

THE SACRIFICE OF LfIWTON.
THE death of General Lawton while leading his
troops is a blow that is felt throughout the
country. He had become the central fighting
in the I : -:â¢â¢ In his disregard
of danger, and the stubborn pluck and courage with
which he marched and fought in the midst of ch
-stacles that were more formidable
than the human enemy, he renewed the best traci
rrny and presented a character that was
or. the high and s '.t-vel of Sheridan and
G-ister. His career had refreshed that confidence al
nen that the occasion would

â  ". I - .-r: stances nor how dangerous the
a culd appear equal to them all.
To the crrr.y :::* death is a calamity, to the country a

Then, referring to the Philippine?, he said: "I

i we extend our sovereignty over remote
â¢ries and alien peoples? I answer that th-.
liable object of such expansion is the establish

the elevation of its people in civilization and the
og of them in progressive self-government with
a vie â¢ â¢ ..ate independence, whether by partner
ship in or separation from the sovereign state."
.y's experience adds to the necessity for de
â¢licy for the Philippines. We have
proceeded so far on military lines of conquest alone,
at a great ccÂ«t in treasure.and a greater cost in lives,
crowned by this last high sacrifice. Every step that
Â»c ha has ad'ied to the animosities which
make ;ke steps necessary, with like results.
Along this course no end is in sight but ultimate ex
termination, which will besom from the islands all
who manifest the spirit of self-government in the
courage of despair with which they fight for it. At
the distant end of this policy there rises the prospect
of a surviving population that has felt no aspiration
â  . eminent and has no intellectual impres
sion of the need of preparation for it. Those who as
1 being dead, slain, as it will appear to the rest,
their aspirations, the process of educating the
dull and cowardly becomes a gloomy prospect
The death of Lawton and the events in Negro? and
Cebu bring into more decided focus a temperate,
â¢ie and wise discussion of the policy that is cost
price. The people will ask if an au
thoritative dec' n the lines of Schurman's
conclusions, will not stop the conflict by impn
the natives not merely with the hopelessness of re
â¢ c but with the hopefulness of a willing and
friendly co-operation to secure practically all that
ire fighting for. It will be observed that Schur
nian contemplates as an alternative their incorpora
tion into the republic aÂ« citizens and the erection of
their country into a State We do not think that the
â¢ican people will ever consent to this. There is
left, then, military subjugation and endless govern
ment by the strong hand or a promise of ultimate in
dependence.
Lawton's death seems to have no bright and con
solir.. -i it. But if some sane policy issue
from the awful sacrifice his fame will shine the
brighter.
The dismissal of the cases against the sure-thing

IRRIGfITION AND Th|E CENSUS.
pi; ROM the Director of the Census information
has been received that special effort wilUbe made
by the Division of Agriculture of the Twelfth
Census of the United States to collect and tabulate
important 4ata relating to irrigation in the arid and
semi-humid regions of the United States. A prelimin
ary schedule has been prepared and will soon be sent
out to obtain the names of corporations and indi
viduals owning irrigating canals or ditches. This is
one of the essential steps for securing desired infor
mation regarding the extent and value of such irri
gation works and their sources of water supply.
In the preliminary schedule a request is made for
the names of the principal canals or ditches in their
order downstream. Request is also made for the
name and postofficc address of some person who can
give detailed information concerning each ditch.
The principal schedule, now in course of preparation,
will be mailed to the addresses thus obtained calling
for further- data, which will be supplemented by de
tailed statistics gathered by the census enumerators.
It 6houfd be noted by all interested in the subject
that these various inquiries of the Census Office in no
way conflict with or duplicate the work with refer
ence to irrigation which is being conducted by any
other department of state. The most nearly related

of Mr. F. H. Xewell, the special agent for irrigation
in the Eleventh Census and hydographer of the
Geological Survey.
The subject is one of vast interest to California,
and it is gratifying to know that the Census Bureau
is preparing to gather comprehensive statistics of the
subject. The information thus obtained will mate
rially aid the more particular work which has b#en
begun under the supervision of Elwood Mead. It
will be readily apparent that the volume and value
of these statistics will depend very largely upon the
attention and interest shown therein by those engaged
in irrigation, and it is earnestly hoped that all to
whom the schedules are addressed will appreciate the
importance of the request and make prompt and care
ful reply. In this way only will it be possible to
make the information concerning irrigation full and
complete.
If some of the British reports of operations in
South Africa are to be taken in sober earnest there
is reason to believe that nature has made a strange
compact with the Boers and is no mean fighting com
panion. It is said that a British flying column has
been stopped in its flight by a river.
ROADSIDE FRUIT IN EUROPE.
ONE of the most interesting papers in the cur
rent number of Consular Reports is that con
taining an account by Hilary S. Brunot,
United States Consul at St. Etienne. concerning the
success which has attended the experiments of various
European Governments in planting fruit or nut trees
: the country roads. The movement began in
c, but has been followed elsewhere, until now
there are a considerable number of districts in Ger
many and in the Duchy of Luxemburg and Belgium
where quite a revenue is derived from these roadside
orchards.
In Wurtemberg the crop in 1878 yielded an income
valued at $200,000. but since that time the number
of additional trees coming into bearing has increased
the revenue more than threefold. In Saxony the an
nual income derived from fruit trees along the na
tional roads rose from $9000 in 1880 to $42,000 in
1892, amounting to a total income of $340,000 for the
thirteen years. Belgian statistics show that up to the
year 1894 there had been planted along the highway?
of that kingdom 741,571 fruit trees, which furnished
I c " ad fund with a revenue amounting to $.2,000,000.
All that has been done in other countries, however,
is but a trifle in comparison with what has been ac
complished in France, where the production of the
roadside trees is estimated at $60,000,000.
For the purpose of providing proper care for the
tiees the road supervisors and employes are care
tructed in "horticulture. The kinds of trees
planted vary with the different districts. In Southern
France the roads are planted with a species of wild
cherry, the fruit of which is used for making wine,
alcohol and a peculiar species of preserves. In
Tourainc plum trees prevail, in Limagne the walnut,
in Auvergne the chestnut and iji Normandy the apple
tree.
It is to be noted that these state economics, so far
from being denounced as an unfair governmental
competition with private enterprise, were brough:
about in France mainly by a demand of the orchard
ists themselves. Consul Brunot says: "Some twenty
years ago the picturesque roads of Northeastern
France were lined with stately poplars, but, although
ornamental, their roots went far and wide, rendering
the adjacent fields sterile, and plows were continually
stopped by offshoots lying almost on the surface of
the soil. The farmers appealed in such strong terms
that the communes decided the fall of the poplar and
the roads vtre cleared of these trees in favor of the
humble but more useful mirabelle (a small plum),
and thousands of baskets of this fruit are shipped to
Paris daily."
Another interesting point is that the increase of the
output of fruit of this kind, so far from injuring the
orchard-owners, led to the development of a new
industry, for when the crops of mirabelles proved too
large to be handled in the ordinary way French in
genuity was set to work to find a new method of
handling them, with the result that large quantities
are now distilled, and the alcohol, slightly perfumed,
finds an increasing sale at increasing price. Five or
six years ago the product was sold in Paris for from
20 to 30 cents a quart, but now it cannot be obtained
for less than 50 cents, and the finer grades bring $1
a quart.
The facts are mainly interesting as illustrations of
the extent to which economies are being practiced in
the heavily taxed countries of Europe. The income
derived by the communes from the trees is an im
portant addition to the road funds. The vast urban
populations afford a market for an almost unlimited
quantity of fruit, and hence the success of the under
taking wherever it baa been tried.
There may be some satisfaction in the fact that a
has been struck by local authorities at the
traffic and profit in misery. The inglorious end of
the Eureka Home is an indication that child torture
has not yet become locally popular.
A Santa Cruz gambler has been convicted for ope
rating a sure-thing proposition which he shrewdly
dubbed "Klondike." His victims probably realize
that they were at the wrong end of the game to feel
the full significance of the new term.
Mayor Snow of Oakland says that the greatest evil
against which the town must fight is that it is too
near to San Francisco. As far as any on e is informed
there is absolutely nothing to deprive Mr. Snow of
the privilege of moving.
The triumph of Uncle Sam's colored troops has
been won. They have conquered the Filipinos with
a cakewalk, and late dispatches show that the con
quered natives are everywhere- feting and entertaining
their black conquerors.
The British War Office, it is said, has awakened
to the necessity of a vigorous campaign in South
Africa. One would think that the affair had already
been speedy enough even to suit the fire-eaters of old
England.

THE CALL'S
Christmas Edition
COMPLIMENTED
Vallejo Times.
The San Francisco Call's Christmas
edition issued Sunday attracted much at
] tention. The cover of the paper was an
artistic triumph.
â¢ . â¢
Woodland Democrat.
The Christmas number of The Call was
a notable publication. It was n<f; remark
able for its size so much as for the ex
cellence of its selection of miscellany and
for the manner in which it was Illus
trated. It contained many choice stories
and sketches, appropriate to the season,
written by eminent literary people, and
the artists who contributed to the pic
torial beauty of its pages are recognised
as among the most talented on the coast.
â¢ â¢ â¢
California Demokrat, Dec. 13.
The Christmas number of the San Fran- :
Cisco Call must be classed as one of the
heretofore unexcelled performances in the
newspaper line in our city. It is not so
much in the large number of pages (52) as
in the artistic make-up and its literary
merit. The colored plates of the supple
ment are- of exquisite beauty and an ar
tistic handling of the subjects which we
had never before had presented to OS.
This Christmas number, practical as It Is.
is so grand that every one should send
copies to friends In the East and In
Europe. The technique as well as the edi
torial work is such that the The Call has
reason to be proud of its performance of
yesterday.

THE MINT-L. A.. City. The positions
in the United State* Mint are controlled
by the Civil Service Commission of the
United States and are in no way affected
by the Civil Service Commission under
the city* new charter. The United States
Civil Service Commission says: "There
Is no need of seekrng the aid of any prom
inent or presumably Influential person to
secure an application blank or an appli
cation, and no recommendation other than
those provided for In the application
blank should be forwarded to the com
mission, as the rules forbid the riling of
any such letters with th- application."
In other words no one can obtain a posi
tion In the Mint or In any other depart
ment without taking an examination.
Examinations are held In the spring and
fall of the year and applicants should
place themselves in communication with
the department In which to take an ex
amination. Under the new charter In
San Francisco women will not be barred
from examination for any position they
can fill, but they will have to take the
; civil service examination. As soon as the
charter goes into operation heads of de
: partments may make temporary appoint
ments, not to hold for more than sixty
days, and It is claimed that after that
all persona will have to take the civil
service examination. For the positions
in Insurance companies asked about, make
application to any Insurance company.

EAST THE SCENE OF ACTION
SIGNIFICANCE OF A HURRIED
TRIP TO NEW YORK.
H K. Huntlngton and General Manager
Kruttschnlu of the Southern Pacilic Com
pany left the city last evening on a hur
ried trip to New York. The fact that they
went to New York Is nothing In Itself,
but. taken with all its attendant circum
stances, It is pregnant with possibilities
of great changes soon to take place in the
official personnel of the great corporation.
It means that th.- effect of the with
drawal of the Crocker Interest from the
company Is soon to bo made manifest in â 
change In the executive staff which will.
In a measure,, extend throughout all the
different departments of the big concern,
touching those In more subordinate posi
tions as well as those high In authority.
Mr. Kruttschnltt has only been back
from his last visit to the metropolis of
the East a little over ten days and Mr.
Huntlngton's return to this city was but
a short time ahead of that of the general
manager. :'.;â 'â 
Yesterday both of these gentlemen re
ceived orders from C P. Huntlngton com
manding then to proceed to New York
at once. The orders were for their Imme
diate departure and they left last night
observing so much secrecy about their
going mat there are a number of
Southern I'acillc employes who will learn
this morning for the first time of the ab
sence of their chiefs from their desks.
When teen last evening Mr. Krutt
schnilt admitted that he was about to go
Hast, but he laid that ho had no Idea
what was the reason of his being sum
moned; he was told to go and lie was
merely obeying the- order.
His opinion was that, as he was one of
the directors of the road, his presence
was required at a meeting that is to take
place in New York about the latter end
of this month. It is customary for the
meetings of the board of directors to be
held In the city that Is the most conveni
ent. Judged from Its proximity to the
greatest number of directors. As all of
the directors necessary to a quorum are
now In the East, with the exception of tho
two who left last night. it was more con
venient for them to go on there than to
have the others come on here.
This i- .ill very true. It Is also true
that Mr. Efuntlngton Is not in the habit
of requiring the attendance of: his sub
ordinates from across the continent unless
he has some very good reason for wishing
to see them, particularly at n season of
the year when they desire to be with their
families nnd when they have only just
returned from a like trip.
The fact of the matter Is that at the
meeting so soon to be held the new vice
president will bÂ»Â» appointed or provision
will be made' for his appointment as soon
as George Crocker's resignation Is re
ceived.
The resignations of Wilson. I^ithrop
and W. H. Crocker arc already In New
York, and George Crocker Is only waiting
for Speyer to pay over the purchase
money for the stock when his resignation
as second vice president will also be pre- I
sented. â¢- â .â¢â¢ . v
The general opinion of those In a posi
tion to know Is that the deal will be closed
by the Orst of the year and before the
new century is a month old George

ST. JOSEPH'Sâ
On Christmas day, following will be the order
of services at St. Joseph's Church, comer of
Howard and Tenth streets.
Masses on Christmas day will be at the
following noun &:W>. 6:30, 7:00, 7:30 8:00,
8:30. 9:00. ?;30 and 10:30 and at 9:00 In the
hall The 5 o'clock mass will be a high

"Kyrle" and "Gloria." by Mercadante and
General); "Credo." "Sanctus" and "Agnus,"
by Caullero, and at the offertory a Christ
mas anthem. "Hac Nocte Est." trio and
chorus. l>y Cagllero. and "Adeste Fldeles."
At 10:30 there will be a solemn high mass.
<"r"ker will have ceased to be an officer
of the Southern l'acluc.
With George Crocker out of the way It
will be necessary to at once appoint some
one to succeed him. and it is to decide on
that some one that the present meeting
i!Â« called.
Persistent rumor has designated H. E.
Huntlngton as the man who is to till the
place. Hut those on the Inside say that
rumor in this case will prove to be In
error. They say that as assistant to the
president 11. E. liuntington already oc
cupies .i place that can have no dignity
added to it by the title of second vice
president and that as he now la he rep
resents his uncle as fully a3 he possibly
could. Moreover, the place under discus
sion calls for one who is In thorough
touch with every detail of the operating
department, and Kruttschnitt Is the man
whose past experience most fully fits him
for such a post.
With the installation of the new officer
every vestige of Crocker and Stanford
patronage will disappear, a new order of
things will prevail and many of tho ad
herents of the old dynasty will find that
with a new king on the throne they will
be lucky to retain such places as they
have without seeking for advancement.

the n â¢ 'i I ..<! signed -he articles binding
themselves to liKi-.t on or about the IStn
of September, 1900, Mr. Tobln offered on
behulf of a syndicate of sporting men in
this cily a purse of IM.4M.
\V. A. Brady; manager of Jeffries, and
G< orge F. Conildlne, â i ting in like capa
eitv lor Corbett. accepted the bid. Before
rattling themselves legally they
changed tneir minds and determine*! to
await further offers in which greater In
ducements might be hÂ»'ld out to them.
There was talk of v meeting in Paris dur
ing the exposition and other proj>ositlons
were advanced, but apparently were all
abandoned. Mr. Tobln did not despair,
and according to his statements yesterday
he finally secured an option on the tight
i and was allowed sixty days In which to
post a satisfactory deposit indicating his
ability to carry out his part of the con
tract.
IWore the time expires he will have ful
filled his part of the agreement, he says,
and will then lay plans for the holding of
the championship battle. According to
Mr. Tobtn it will be held in this city, but
whether Indoors at night or out of doors
In the daytime ha.- not been derided. If
Indoors Mechanics' Pavilion la the only
available building approaching the size
necewary. Even this would be too small
I and enormous prices would have to i"
exacted in order to meet expenses, If
I held lit one of the tracetracln or the Velo
drome, where there is a natural amphi
theater, a vast throng of people could bÂ«
accommodated and a moderate admission
fee charged. As it In anticipated the city
will bÂ« overflowing 1 with visitors on Ad
mission day. 1900. an attendance of 100.000
spectators Is estimated if the fight be held
at that time.
All reports received from New York in
dicate that Corbett Is in deadly earnest in
â¢ his desire to regain his lost laurels. He
Is said to be taking excellent care of him
m if and Â«s doing regular gymnasium work
to prepare for the more vigorous demands
â  which active training for so important an
engagement will entail. For the moment
Jeffries has dropped out of Bight and is
n^t in the public eye.
If carried to a successful outcome th*
bout would attract worldwide Intel to
this city.

INDIAN FOOTBALL MEN
EXPECTED THIS EVENING
TWO FAMOUS CARLISLE BACKS.
Â«
FROM Pennsylvania to the Pacino. ThP Carilsle Indian?, football i>l:iy
ers that have mad* the tiitj <Âll^^o trams of the Kast strain th.-ir ut
naoal to i>rÂ»vent defeat, will arrlv.- in this city this evening on the Cen
tral overland. While in San Vranctaco awaiting the Chrlatmaa flay
pamo with the victorious California Â«Â»lÂ»-v. n they will stop at the Palace Hotel
That the red me n will attract the attention of the general puMlr i- certain
for they are to-day the most conÂ«pi< -uoiis body of amateur athletes In
America.
The trip undertaken by the Indians will establish a proro<J.>nt on this
â¢ oast. For many years the two biR CoUegei of California have beÂ«ri trying ti)
bring out one of the strong eleven* of the Ka.st, but until this aeaaoii failure
h;rf- attended their efforts. The Carlisle kickers wh.. will play here Christmas
day have â  national reJuUtlon, and the fall eleven will be aeen face 1
with the University of California team. Metoxen, the plunging fullback' Mil
ler and Seneca, halves, that start like lightning; Hudson, the famoua'fleld
goal kicker, and linesmen who play with a dash and vigor that stand for the
acme Âf football, will be with the team. On Friday and Saturday the Indiana
will practice on the gridiron which la to be the â cene of the battle They will
re.-t (.11 Sunday, the day preceding the engagement of Kast and West.
All indications point to a hi* attendance at the game. Tickets have been
<>n sale since the beginning of the week and already â uffldent money baa
Pâ ed over the counter to defray the expenses Incurred Â»>y California in
bringing out the Indians. Something like â  Thanksgiving crowd win be
present al the ciime, but Instead of red and blue and gold th<- latter colon win
predominate. California's coaches are sanguine that the Blue ami Sold team
tflll make a great showing, and defeat would surprise them. The Califor
nia* men are working hard tryiriK to roach condition. All football enthusiasts
anticipate the greatest game ever seen on the coast, and are now preparing
for a lung-exercising combat.
ICICLES ON
THE TALENT
AT OAKLAND
Five Sharp Favorites Snowed
Inâ Owner and Rider of
Loving Cup Suspended.
The shady condition of the atmosphere
froze up five of the six favorites at Oak
land yesterday -and they are no doubt
still undergoing thÂ« thawing- cut process.
It was a most disastrous running for the
talent and the majority of the bookmak
ers suffered from expansion of the bank
roll, a turf disease attended by no 111 After
effects.
Faveraham, In the second, was the
first clnchy favorite to ko by the board.
The ring liÂ»-lÂ«l the black horse an 11 to 10
chance, iin<l after he had been Jostled by
Ilullman, on Stuttgart, opposite the pad
dock, ran unplaced. "Iceman" Spencer
made a QUiet sneak along the rail â with
Whaleback, setting the decision from
Stuttgart by a neck. The "rough bouse"
tactics of Bullman were not appreciated
by the stand and his mount was disqual
ified, which cave Anchored second and
thÂ« favorite third place.
Later on. In the tlfth event, this was
followed by the downfall of Loving Cup,
another "pipe." Four to five was consid
ered a good price by the smart ones. Dis
playing an indifferent turn of speed the
Eastern mare finished third. February,
with Vlttitoe in the saddle and l. > tJ 1.
won almost easily from the 6<J to 1 shot,
Grand Sachem.
The outsider captured the opening sell-
Ing scramble for three-year-olds. Jingle
Jingle, with anywhere from 15 to 25 to l
against her chances, drew away from her
field in the stretch, beating out White
Fern four lengths. Synia. a good thing
from the stable of Dr. Howell, played
from 8 to l.( to 5 favoritism, got away
from the post badly and was never prom
inent.
' After delaying the start for many min
utes. Meddler, a l to 2 favorite, broke
away in front, and the third number
proved easy for him. Alaska finished
well, leading out Don Luis for the place.
At th.- weights, It looked as if Dr. Her
nays could do the trick In the mile and
a quarter run. decided under selling con
ditions, and he ruled a strong favorite.
T. Walsh stole away In the lead with
Dare, the second choice, and at the wire
the favorite was just about two strides
late, losing the verdict by a head in 2:07
flat. Iforse landed Dr. Marks, a 75 to l
shot. In the show.
Twelve two-year-olds started In the
six-furlong dash, with The Lady, an even
money choice. She Is naturally a slow
beginner, and getting away badly never
got near the front. Bullman rushed off
In the lead with Bamboulla, and the
Spreckels entry won galloping from
Ailenna. Gllssando, a 50 to 1 shot, took
show honors.
Track Notes.
The card this afternoon is about the
best one offered this season, some of the
fastest hurt's In training being down to
appear.
The yearlings and horses In training
from Sonoma stock farm will be sold at
Occidental Horse Kxehange this evening.
Some superbly bred ones will be led into
the ring.
After his display of obstinacy at the
post the Judges ordered the entry of Med
dler refused at Oakland.
Bullman'a overanxtoty and rough work
on Stuttgart were rather expensive. a.s the
judges set him down on the ground f..r
the balance of the meeting. Barney
Srhreiber seems to be having more than
hi* share of hard Hick.
Georg.- W. Miller, owner of Loving Cup,
and Jockey Joe Welior were suspended
pending aii investigation into the mure*
rac*-.
The ring laid 8 and 10 to 1 about Dr.
Marks to shew.
Both <'roker and Synla were hot tips
for the opening dash.
Being unal.lt- to secure one of the high
priced riders. W. R. l,arzalere placed but
$80 on the chances of his filly Jingle
Jingle, overlooking a chance for a "kill
ing." T. Walsh rode hÂ« r to perfection.
This same lad put up a nice ride later in
the day on Dare 11.
After winning his race Meddler was bid
up $K>o over the entered selling price of
$200 by some stranger, evidently not fa
miliar with the ways of selling conditions.
He quit after making the one bid, sur
prised that the horse was not knocked
down to him. #
Both Dr. Hernays and Dr. Marks, sec
ond and third respectively in the fourth
event, were formerly owned by Barney
Schrelber.
Bamboulia was heavily played to win,
and the ring laid away little over the de
feat of The I>ady.

SERIES OF
SIX GAMES
ARRANGED
Sacramento and All-California
Will Wind Up the
Season.
Nine hits in one inning and a bunch of
bewhlskered errors have taken some of
tho conceit out of the Ail-California nlno
that has been meeting tho teams of
the California League the past few
weeks. It was the sttckworlc of
the Dudes, Coupled with tne ragged
playing of the All-Callfon max
did the trick. On account of their over
whelming defeat tetter ball la promised
for the series of six games between Sae
ramentos and the* All-Callforrtlas.
'lli- games will be played on Saturday.
Sunday and Christmas day. the following
Saturday and Sunday and New Years
day. Then baseball In San Francisco will
ceaM until the opening of the season in
the latter part of March. Sacramento will
plHy its regular team. Harvey and Doyla
being mi. l In the box. Since the game
last) Sunday the All-Callfornlas realise
that without Hugh*-* they are no stronger
than the local teams, so every effort will
be made to have Hughes here for Sun
day's game.
A very lamÂ© shoulder Is tho excusa
Knell gives for the devastation on Ms
curves.
Van Haltren. the old-time wonder of
California, will be seen in the box durintf
the next season. He pitched a Â»cam- In
the big league last season against W.iah
ington and th- New Yorkers won out.
Hulin will play third for the .UI-<'alifor
nlas against Sacramento.
When the league magnate* get together
early next month the managers of thÂ«
country teams will have to give a guar
antee that their clubs will not b#> thrown
on the. league on account of poor manac>
m- nt So far Santa Cru2. San Jose. Sac
ramento. San Kranrlsco and Oakland ar*
talking about entering teams.
Doyle'H franchise will probably M

HERR MOST PREDICTED WAR.
Ilerr Most. the. anarchist, spoke to an
audience of several hundred at Metropoli
tan Hall last evening. Ha m Intro
duced by T. K. Simpson, who made a few
preliminary remarks. In which ho gave
assurance that the anarchists were lnÂ»
safest people on earth t.i be .mi":..: not
withstanding the foolish talk of Ignorant
persons who Inferred that an anarchist
was always loaded up with bombs and
assorted explosives that he longed to flro
off. The choir of the Socialist MaennÂ«-r
chor HanÃ. and H.-rr Most spoke. Ho
wore a Prime Albert â¢â â¢.it. which WM
well Riled. He was In poor voice, he Bald,
but he managed to keep his hearer*
laughing much of the time by his method
of presenting and arranging his state
ments. He predicted that there would bo
a world-wide war between thÂ« poor nvn
of the earth and the capitalists. It
might be In a year or six months, or ten
years. It was his duty to put the peopl.i
on their guard, that they might bÂ« In
readiness. After the war there would bo
anarchy, which he denned ns a condi
tion of affairs where there would be no
governments, but all people would work
For the. common Interest. His talk was
mild for the most part. He denounced thÂ»
campaign of the Hrltlsh In South Af
rica and the Americans In the Philip
pine Islands. Capitalists committed mur
der day by day. because men were no
cheap. Anarchism would finally maka
wars Impossible. There would be, no
peace, no harmony In the world until pri
vate authority, private property ami
priesthood were all abolished. Capitalists
were robbers. Mankind existed hundred*
of thousands of years lief ore they In-
Vented "damnable civilisation." Then
they were free. They were not free now.
Capitalists: were trying to get a great
army and a great navy for the Uniteil
States. That was the real meaning of
the operations In the Philippines. In thÂ»Â»
end free, speech and free press would bÂ«Â»
Impossible. There were Sou kings In th*
United* States. The only difference be
tween the United States and a European
monarchy was In the name. Society could
not be changed by peaceful means. What
could be done? Nothing was left to ha
done but an uprising of the poor peonl.j
all over the globe. War would be de
clared In all the world. One tin day
there would be an army of proletarian*
in the field with the mi flag flying nvÂ«-r
them and tyrants would be swept from
the face of the globe. His final utter
ance was: "To hell with capitalists and
priests and politicians! We want the
earth which we have cultivated."

OPPOSITION ANSWERED.
Mayor Phelan Resents Inspired At
tack of a Railroad Organ.
In the heart of the Mayor's precinct
was held last night a rousing meeting
In favor of bonds. It was called under
the auspices of the Central Association
of Improvement Clubs and the Federation
of Mission Improvement Clubs and was
very largely attended
Mayor Phelan confined his remarks al
most entirely to the opposition to tho
bonds that has been shown by the South
ern Pacific Company through Its news
paper organs.
. "This evening," said the Mayor, "1 read
an editorial in an evening paper attack
ing the bond question and questioning the
sincerity of its promoters. As we all
know, the paper is the mouthpiece of the
railroad company, and during the past
three or four years everything that has
been attacked by Its editors dim been
favored by the people. 1 think, therefore,
that we ought to welcome the opposition
of the railroad company because its in
spiration is bo plain. It does not wan: the
park brought closer to the people because
It wants forever to colk-ct all the nickels
possible for carrying people to and from
Golden Gate Park. Should we vote to
issue these bondr. the railroad people will
have to pay their share of the taxes and
it is never pleasant to th. Southern Pa
cific Company to pay out taxes. Hence it
declares that there is no necessity for
improvements and it emits a wail that
San Francisco should be so progressive
as to want to do anything that may keep
a few dollars from its receptive trt-asury.
"It has also been said that the bond
Issue is being fought- by the pioneers.
This Is not fo. Tne men who are opposing
It are merely a handful of Silurians who
are walking about to save funeral ' ex
penses. Many of the sturdiest of our
pioneers can be seen nightly on our plat
forms doing all in their power to help
along a new era of progress and wake
fulness."

They spoke strongly in favor of all of the
bond propositions. The meeting closed,
however, with Senator Braunhart still
speaking.
Panhandle Popular With Work
ingmen.
Employes of the Union Iron Works lis
tened attentively yesterday afternoon to
arguments in favor of the panhandle ex
tension and bonding the city for new
Echoolhouses, an up-to-date sewer system
and a habitable hospital. The working
men were greatly Interested in the sub
ject, and from the applause that greeted
the speakers it may be Inferred that a ma
jority of them are favorable to the pro
posed public Improvements.
â  The principal speaker was Mayor Phe
lan. lie said that the contemplated im
provements appealed with the greatest
force to the working Classen. "The ex- I
penditure of vast sums of money on pub
lic works in a city the charter of which
provides that none but those who havw
resided here for at least a year shall bo
employed on such work Is bound to bene
fit the workingmen now here." said the
Mayor. "There can be no escape from
that conclusion, and the argument that
the extension of the park panhandle and
other public Improvements will nil the city
with unemployed men is folly." He de
clared that the greater part of the $11,000 -
030 that It is proposed to expend will go
among the laboring classes and most of it
will remain in San Francisco. Prolonged
cheers greeted the Mayor at the conclu
sion of his argument.

Soon after he had been granted the con

a corporation which was called the Scenic

Killlcan was accordingly summoned to ap
pear before the board and explain the
matter.
Besides McKilllcan there were present
yesterday C E. Snook. J. W. FKwfcai Jr.

IfcKillican said that he had transferred

far as the ('ominisnloners could ascertain

asked that his permit be canceled. This
was done by the board. It Is understood
that an application for similar privileges
will now be put in by the corporation.

Superintendent of Tugs and Dredgeri are

The contract for repairing Clay street
wharf was let to Darby LÂ«aydon & Co. for
$1017 '<0. Chief Engineer Holmes reported
to the board that the fishermen Â«er*Â«
well satisfied with the new quarters that
are to be built for them near Black Point.
It is proposed to build a miniature sea
wall from section B out as far m Leaven
worth street. This will give the fisher
men a space that will extend as far* back
as Jefferson street. A committee appoint
ed by the fishermen went over the ground
with Chief Engineer Holmes and all par
ties are now satisfied as to the necessary
work to be done. In about a month's
time the commission will be ready to be
gin work and early in the now year thÂ«
fishermen will move, bag and basrsraee,
from their present quarters to North
Beach. This will entail quite an exodus
of Italian, Greek and Slavonian fisher
men from one side of Telegraph Hill to
the other.
The Forty-eighth Regiment came over
from Angel Inland yesterday on the
steamers Sea Queen and General McDow
ell and were placed on the transport
Grant. Their baggage was eonveyetf on
the steamer Caroline, but as there was
over EM tons of it the sailing of the
steamer was considerably delayed in or
der to get it aboard. The men are fine,
strapping fellows and took their removal
from the detention- camp direct to the
transport as a matter of course. The col
ored boys -had no chance to form any ac
quaintances here, as they were only a few
days at the â¢ Presidio before smallpox
broke out among them and they had to
go Into quarantine. In consequence there
were very few people down to see the
transport away.
The Forty-eighth is the last regiment
that will go to the war. General Otis will
have all the troops the Government in
tends sending to the Philippines as soon
as the Grant arrives, but Judging from
the way the war Is going there will not be
much for the Forty-eighth to do on its
arrival.
Freight Is being rushed. aboard the Kob
mos steamer Tanls and she will go away
from here a full ship. In fact, the agents
are now beginning to . refuse . shipment*
for South American ports. The Pacific
Mall has lost no time in getting into the
fight, and a cut of $1 50 a ton on flour has
been announced on the steamer sailing on
the 2Sth. -This Is a new departure for th*Â»
Mall Company." Hitherto It has confined
its cutting to rebates and In that way l kept
the rate to the general public at the old
figure. Recognizing, however, that the

VIII. AS YOU LIKE IT.
Critical Comments.- â¢ â¢
Professor Dowdcn. one of the most
genial and appreciative of critics', aptly ]
Mill As You Like It" the Vswe<?tc.st and j
happiest of. Shakespeare's comedies," and
Dr. Furnivall, another of the best living t
commentators, groups *it with "Much
Ado" and. â¢.'Twelfth. Night,"', which' we're
written at about the same, time as "the
three sunny or â¢ sweet-time comedies!"
As I have said, I like to think It. a* Dow
den does, the first of â¢ the three, written
when the author had Just completed the
regular series of English historical plays,
and perhaps as a rest for his imagination j
âthe recreation that is got by taking up '
an entirely different kind of literary I
work. History was for the time for- |
gotten and free scope was given to fancy, i
amid the scenes of a purely ideal lifeâ j
an Arcadia where they "fleet the time i
carelessly as they did in the golden
world." The result Is a pastoral- drama
in which we have almost unbroken sun- !
shine, no more of shadow being intro
duced than serves to give variety to the
scene. It is not the "shadow that fore
bodes the coming of night or of tempest, i
but rather like that of a passing summer
cloud, or like that of the green canopy ,
of a pleasant wood, falling, flecked with (
sunlight sifted through the leaves,. upon <
the velvet sward below.
The story of the play is a tissue of im
probabilities. We might perhaps go as :
far as a certain critic does in calling it
"childish and absurd," and yet, as he |
adds, "it has been for 300 years the
groundwork of perhaps the most con
stantly delightful and popular comedy in
the English language." This is partly
due to the subtle effect of the "charmed
air" of that Forest of Arden. In which we ,
forget to be critical. We can sympathize
.with the poet Campbell, who, when he
first detected some of the Incongruities In
the play, after having been blind to them
for many years, shut his eyes to the fault
because of his love for the comedyâ
love, as be said, "Is willfully blind."
"Away with your best-proved Improb
abilities when the heart has been touched
and fancy fascinated!"
But it was not the scene and the atmo
sphere that made himâ that makes usâ
love the play, but the fact that the lead-
Ing characters are. not mere puppets, a*
â¢we might expert them to be in M crude a
story, but living men and women. We â¢
cannot help loving them and following
their fortunes with the keenest Interest
and sympathy. Shakespeare's characters
become so real to us that we keep up our
interest In them after the curtain has
fallen upon their fortunes. We speculate I
as to their subsequent behavior and wel
fare and dispute as to their probable fate.
We enjoy going back to the beginning of
the drama. an Mary Oowden-Clarke has
done in her "Glrlhuod of Shakespeare' '
Heroines," and Lady Martin In some of
her delightful studies ol the characters
she had personated on the stage. The
questions they suggest have a perennial
fascination.
Rosalind must be . reckoned one of the
most charming of Shakespeure'a women. |
â¢Perhaps -she remind* us more of Beatrice ]
than any other of them, and yet Â»he is
not wholly like her. She i.- as witty, as
piquant, n.s vivacious, but she has a love
liness and a fascination all her own. In
her disguise, though she wean* It natural
ly and easilyâ quit unlike Viola, for in
stance, who is never entirely at ease in
Itâ she does not lose her feminine sweet
ness and delicacy.
She has a singularly healthy natureâ
mentally and morally no less than physi
cally. She is sound and sweet in heart,
; as she is fair of face. How admirably she
Ruts to flight the melancholy Jaques with
his self-potted sentimentality, his traveled
affectation and conceit. How witty and
how womanly her snubbing of the pert
little Phebe when the shepherdess laughs
at the Idea that she can ever suffer from
"love's keen arrows," as Sylvius does.
Rosalind comes forward and addresses
the pitiless coquette: .
And why. I pray you? Who might bÂ« your
mother.
' That you Insult, exult, and all at once, ! ;
Over the wretched? â¢ â¢. â¢

Never did silly girl get better school-
Ing than thatâ and from a girl, we may

Orlando is her manly counterpartâ
her a thoroughly healthy nature. I know
no better word to describe htm briefly. 1
Once, for a moment, when the sky is very
dark, he gives way to despondency:
' nut. poor old man, thou prun'nt a rotten true,
That cannot so much as a blossom yield
In lieu of all thy pains and husbandry;
but with the very next breath he takes :
heart again:
But come thy ways; we'll go along together.
And ere we have thy youthful wages spent.
V. â¢ II light upon some settled low content.
He has tenfold more cause to be melan
choly than the affected Jaqucs, but when
the latter, In the forest, asks, "Will ye sit
down with me. and we two will rail,
against our mistreats, the world and all â 
our misery?" note his reply: "I will chide
no breather in the world but myself,
against whom I know most faults." No
wonder that Jaques slinks away after a â 
few brief attempts at sneering repartee.
Jaquts. by the way, is the great enigma
of the play, and the critic* differ widely
In their estimate of him. I had something
to say about him, but the limits. assigned*
me compel its omission. I commend Dow- ,
den's comments upon him to the student,

Dowden's comparison of Jaques- to Sterna
seems to mo a peculiarly happy one.
Not- to refer even briefly to the othÂ«r
characters, let us (of a moment consider
the question. What la the "fundamental
Idea" of the play, as the Germans like to
call It? Two critics, one a man, tho other
a woman. agree well In stating It. Mr.
Nell. In his Introduction to- the play. s-i> .-:
"When wo read thin drama "we see. that it
recognize* . love â¢ as- the pivot' and center
of activity and Joy. the very core of life.
â¢ â¢ â¢ When we observe that all the colls
In the play originate In the" neglect of tho
royal law of life,' 'Thou shait love thy
neighbor as thyselfâ how selfishness com

It not be that *As You LJka It' is a dlvlno

("Morality"' -is here used in the old dra

moral truth or. lesson.) i

the herolne-of the , play la a manner to

said;

Selected Critical Studies.
"Sweet are the uses of adversity." mor
alizes the banished Duke, anil external,
mcterlol adversity has come to him. to
Rosalind and to Orlando; but If fortune
is harsh, natureâ both external nature and
human characterâ ls sound and .sweet, and
of real suffering there Is none In the play.
All thai Is evil remains In the soctetv
which the denizens of the forest have left
behind; and both seriously. In the charac
ters of the usurping Duke and Oliver, and
playfully, through Touchstone's mockery
of court follies, a criticism on what Is
evil and artificial in society Is suggested.
In contrast with the woodland life; yet
Shakespvare never falls Into the conven
tional pastoral manner. Orlando Is an
Ideal of youthful strength, beauty and
noble Innocence of heart, and Rosalind.*
.bright, tender womanhood seems to grow
more exquisitely feminine In the mat* at
tire which she has nssumed In self-de
fense. Her feelings are almost as quick
and fine as those of Imogen (she has not.
like Imogen, known fear ard sorrow). an<l
she uses her wit and bright play of Intel
lect oa a protection against her own eagt-r

lighted consciousness of power to confer
happiness, she can dally with disguises
and-make what Is most serious to her at
the same' time possess the charm of an
exquisite frolicâ Edward Dowden.

brings out the more fully his consum

Rosalind ii created for the situation, and
the situation for Rosalind. "Hho is wit
and womanliness/ as Mr. Verity says.
"in equal Ltoportlons." and It is precisely
this romolnatlon that makers Rosalind.
Beatrice is as witty, and Imogen morn

of Shakespeare's women are tho two qual

Orlando Is near and loves her that fancy
catches tire from feeling and rises In
brilliant coruscation. This li the pecu
liar quality of her wit. It la neither bois
terous nor personal. She does not "speak
poniards," like Beatrice, but deals in
bright generalities, "that Rive d* light and
hurt not." ' When she wishes to wound
it is not irony that she uses. Her gayety
Is the flower of youth and of v brave and
high spiritâ a part of her inheritance of
noble birth which sustains her in adver
sity and Is never forgotten In her mÂ»i*
quera.de. Shakespeare has disdained for
her saka the obvious farcical opportunities
which the situation offers and snma of
which he has worked out in "Twe'fth,

dependent kind, to which a little ridicule
Is not fatal. It may be thought that she
keeps Orlando too long In suspense, bi'i it
must be renumbered that till their second

two cousins. Beatrice and Hern, in the
play Shakespeare had Just finished. Rosa

In their victorious wit. Yet th differenco
between them is very great; Shakespeare,
never repeats himself. Tho wit of Bea
trice is aggressive and challenging:
we see. as it were, the gleam of a rapter
in it. Rosalind's wit is gayety without a
sting; the gleam in It is of "that aw.-, t
radiance" which Oehlenschlager attri
buted to Frela; her sportive nature masks
the depth of her love. Beatrice can b<j
brought to lore because she is a woman,
and stands in no respect apart from her
sex. but she Is not of an amatory nature.
Rosalind Is seized with a passion for Or

NHW YORK. D*c. "0.-The stock market
rave, a demonstration Of improved tone and
nerve in the spirit with which it accepted
a Mump of isÂ«i |.oints In Brooklyn Transit, ac
companied by sympathetic weaknehs j n other
Hooks allied to it. It cannot be said that
this violent decline was viewed with Indif
ference, for It effectually checked the advanc
ing tendency In the genera! market and worked
a reaction extending Â«Â»vÂ«r 2 |>olntiÂ» In a num.
l*r of standard rallrt.od stocks and from 4 to
7 point* In some of the Industrials. Thanks
to the earlier rise in the market, however, and
the rally following the slump net losses are
in nearly all c**Â«-Â» small and Â«omc substantial
Â»Â»Â«-t calns arc hhown by lmj.ortant Mocks. The
Im-ak in Brooklyn Transit wan attributed to
the force-d liquidation of a large Inside ac
count, concerning which many unfavorable
rumors of Monday were revived In full force
and exaggentti-d by the bears with a view to
breaking the niarkt-t. At this time last year.
after a notable advance, the stock â  >id at
arÂ«ut 72. and by April of this year It touched
the high level at li 7 without ever having paid
a dividend. In the demoralization which .1
lowed the sudden death of ex-Governor Flower
the organized efforts to support and save the
markÂ» â  convericed ui>on the stock and kent It
above r.af. There was that to bÂ« accomplished
to-day and it pursued Its course, but was not
allowed to unsettle and demoralize the whole
market as was the case on Monday. The tone
of the market during the r-arly hours was
nearly normal except that trading was active
and fluctuations rather wide. Prices had ad
vanced and received an additional Impulse up
ward with the announcement of the Increase
Jn New York Central's dividend rate, that
rtock rising to 3504. Hxtreme declines from
the high level In other than Brooklyn Transit
were: Sugar. 74; Federal Steel. 6; People's
Gas, Manhattan and Tennessee Coal about 6
and Tobacco and MetrojÂ«olltan 4 The weak
ness in railroad stocks which showed the larg
est declines could be traced In part to the
*aroe sources as those which were responsible
for the break In Brooklyn Transit. The de
cline* extended to ] points only in Rock Island
Atchlson preferred, Burlington, St. Paul and
X.*iulÂ»vll!e. In Brooklyn Transit. Sugar Fed
rral Ktcel. Tennessee Coal and Peoples Gas
the recovery reached S to 64 points and it
â mounted from 1 to : points all through the
list. Its vicissitudes rlnce then have been
many and various, and transactions In it alone
have Â«one to make up the bulk of trading
on the Stock Exchange on many days. There
have been single Â«.-.,.â . when the total trans
actions in this stock exceeded several fold Its
total capital issue and it hss been the favorite
of the highly speculative clars. who delight
in manipulation and mystery. Previous to this
week Its low price for this year had been 7T>4 ;
On Monday it touched C 4 In the icenerai
demoralization. To-day It touched 61 and re
bounded 64. This review of the course of a
single stock Is fertile in suggestion of ex
planation of the whole series of events in this
week"* mar.- During the day when Brook
lyn Transit was showing most acute weakness
thÂ» rate for call money was 4 pr rent and
was in plentiful rupply. The rate at no time
rose above â¢ per cent and In th- late dealings
fell to 2 per cent, or yesterday's low level
During thÂ» day an engagement of told for
shipment to London was announced and ru
mors were current at further heavy engage,
menta to go out on S&turday. The announce
ment and the prospect Â»eemcÂ»d to have no
effect on the local money market. The anomoly
of a I per cent money rate and gold being
allowed to r.i out while stocks are forced to
liquidation at haajry sacrifices warrants no
other conclusion than that the security offered
for loans to carry stocks In Home Instances Is
unsatisfactory. Such is known to he the case.
Yesterday's measures of protection and relief
were etlll in fore* to-day ThÂ« market closed
strong at the rally at mixed net changes.
The bond market was active and ehow*Â»d later
reactions from the early strength, making the
tone Irregular. Total sale*, par value. {3.150.-

London Market.
NEW YORK. Dec. 20.â The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablÂ«Â»cram says:
The market was weak this morning except for
American shares. All other stocks were offered
plentifully and liquidation was geneial. But la
the afternoon the wreckaee was absorbed and a
better tone developed, especially for Austra
lians, which had been badly hit.
"Hie opinion of the street now is that the
bank rate- will not be raised, and It Is hoped
that all trouble will be avoided over the set
tlement. The arrangements for that have been
completed. Consols were SSTÂ». Americans ad
var.ced above parity, then half an hour after
1 the start there was liquidation. All the Ameri
, cans were steadily sold until well below parity.
I New York accepted our Drices and the close,
well below the best as well as above the worst,
too. They hardened on the street afterward.
Sranlsh fours' were 64H; T!ntoÂ«. 42%. Ana
condas. 7 S-16. The bank bought Â£27.000 of
French cold/ Â£IR.OCO In bars. The inflow of
the week has been Â£410.000. Call loans were
easy to get at a low point. 44 per cent. The
bank did a bit: business in bills.

eased â¢IT to the end, dull throughout. The war
scare holdings were let out and the price sank
to a shade over the normal plane It occupied

a potent bullish factor. May closed \c under

when a quiet business Is always expected. It
being a holiday and stock taking period. The
tight money market ooald not have come at a
better time for the wool trade, as their oblica
tions matured last November. Their wool has
been largely sold and turned Into caah and the
members of the trade are not borrowers to-day.
The demand for wool U now running more to
the coarser grades. Fine wools have reached
such a high point that manufacturers are try
ing more and more to substitute medium wools
for them. Sales of the past w*-ek have been
made at the top prices of the year. The sales
of the week in Boston amounted to 2.9J6.000
pounds domestic and 425.000 pounds foreign.
making a total of 3.3C5.C00 pounds, against a
I total of 6,0;4.ooo pounds for the previous week,

"AUTOTYPED.'
Not Dictated, When You Typewrite
Your Own Letters.
A few business men. who are old-fash-
ioned as well as elderly, still view the
typewriting machine as an offensive Inno-
vation, but In the vast majority of com-
mercial transactions the pen Is now used
only for the production of signatures, and
enormous has been the consequent econ-
omy of time, temper and eyes. In private
correspondence, however, the pen still
preteitds to scorn th- competition of the
machine, and anybody who ventures to
break the general rule must be prepared
for cold disdain or angry expostulation.
The reason for this, probably. Is the fact
that once it could fairly be assumed that
every typewritten letter was a dictated
letter, and of course everybody wants the
transmission of his or her friend's* thought
to be as direct as possible. But nowadnys
a large number of people besides profes-
sional secretaries have learned the mys-
tery of typewriting, and for them It would
be a huge convenience if the last Impor-
tant prejudice against typewritten letters
as such, could be dissipated. Would It
not be possible to effect the desired changa
by Inventing a word to be used as "Dic-
tated" Is by the business world* "Autr>-
typed" would do If it had not already been
burdened with several other signification*
"Self- written" Is clumsy and inaccuKS*
and "Unassisted" would be too vagu.' " ,
Some one of our ingenious correspondents '
can doubtless solve the problem, and win
the gratitude of folks who have come
find the pen a nuisance, but who deÂ«lr*
to retain their refutation for the ordinary
courtesy.-New York Times. - vrJUD^'TOOK CARBOLIC

secretary of the fund and there are yet
about twenty pchools to be htard from.
As soon as the money Is all collected It
will bÂ« added to $250 now in the paving's

manner do away with further collections.
In this connection it 1? noteworthy that
the pupils of the Columbia Grammar

TRAIN STOPPED IN TIME.
Narrow Escape of a Woman From a
Frightful Death.
An accident which might have termin
ated fatally were It not for the quick ac
tion of James Stanley, an engineer on the
Southern Pacific local train, happened at
the Park street crossing at Alameda Mon
day afternoon and resulted in the serious
Injury of Mrs. Kline, wife of S. L. Kline,
a merchant of Portland, Oregon.
Mrs. Kline had been to see her daughter,
who attends Mills' College, and was on
her way home. When crossing the nar
row gauge track her foot caught In a frog
and she fell. The local train, which was
due at the time, was but a short distance
away and rapidly bearing down on the
prostrate woman. Luckily, the engineer
paw the accident and hurriedly applied
the brakes, but none too soon, as the en
gine was almost upon Mrs. Kline when It
came to a full stop. The releasing of
Mrs. Kline's foot from the trap was â 
matter of no little work and it required
the united strength of two men to extra
talc her from her perilous position. The
woman was placed on the train and ac
companied by her daughter, reached this
side of the bay. where she was placed in
a hack after much painful maneuvering
and removed to her home at 1630 Hayes
street. The physicians who are attend
ing Mrs. Kline have not yet determined
how seriously she has been injured,
though it i.- known that her spine is bad
ly wrenched, as Is also her wrist and
ankle.

THE ARRIVAL OF
DE PACHMANN
VLADIMIR DE PACHMANN. the
Russian pianist, who Is to give
three recitals here next week, ar
rived here last night on the South
ern Overland from Chicago. It Is eight
years since De Pachmann visited Pan
Francisco, and his reputation, which was
great at that time, particularly as an In
terpreter of Chopin, has been growing
steadily, until to-day he Is recognized as
one of that small group of the truly great
virtuosi.
It will be remembered by many bow
De Pachmann gave a series of Chopin re
citals, arid, while he created a deep Im
pression, he laid himself open to the
charge that he knew hU weakness m well
as his strength, and therefore did not
essay the work of other composers. It
was as a consequence of those innuendoes
that De Pachmann announced an addi
tional concert at which he rendered selec
tions from Schumann. Beethoven and
Liszt, and with such a masterful style
and might as to effectually put an end to
the assertion that he was merely a
Chopin soeciallst.
Mr de Pachmann went to the Palace
Hotel on his arrival. He will remain here
for ten days, when he proceed* to IxÂ»s
Angeles, returning again to San Francisco
and going finally to Portland, Or.

TIIE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, DECEMUER 21. 1899.
JAMES FERGUSON
USES HIS FISTS
ON A COLLECTOR
P. Mulligan Thrashed
by a Horseman.
FIGHT AT THE PALACE HOTEL.
DIRE RESULT OF TRYING TO
COLLECT A BILL.
Collectors are not popular with race
track people. Some time ago one of the
Qulnn boys met a representative of Col
lector Raver on a ferry-boat and present
ed him with a "bunch of fives" that he
will remember as long as he lives, and
last nlrht in the court of the Palace Ho
tel J. B. Ferguson, starter at the track,
handed a similar package to Pat Mulli
gan, who collects on commission. His fa
vorite plan Is to wait until hÂ« catches nls
man in the company of ladles and then
to request him to pay his debt*, relying
on the man pungllng up to cover his em
barrassment.
Borne time ago Mr. Ferguson contracted
a debt of $21 50 for some Jewelry pur
chased of the firm of Schumacher A: Co..
who do business under the Palace Hotel.
Schumacher assigned the debt to Mulli
gan, who started to collect It by his usual
methods. About a week ago he met Fer
guson In the hotel elevator. The horse
man was accompanied by tome ladles
and the collector took advantage of the
meeting to offensively request Ferguson
to settle. Some warm words passed, but
in consideration of the presence of the
ladies the matter was passed over by Fer
guson.
The horseman did not forgive the epi
sode ami waited for an opportunity which
would liml him freÂ»- to act without being
hami'<-rril. The opportunity <-.ime last
evening. Mr. F< rgu^or waa standing with
some Friends In the court <>f the hotel
when Mulligan approached and. In an of
fensive mn'.: â¢ r t- quested the starter to
settle his Indebtedness.
Ferguson did not answer but his strong
ran shot out and. catching the bill
r :i the left optic, raised a lump
the sire of a hen's egg. Before the Â«ur
us'irer could escape he received a
stinging lÂ»ft hook that cut his cheek in
the vicinity of the car. He ha<l gathered
himself together and. striking ineffectlve
lv at his iLss.iil.int. boat a hUITte 1 rÂ» -
treat, hut not before the athletic starter
had landed a couple of nwrt .stiff Jabs on
his already badly damaged frontispiece
Schumacher says h.- had nothing to do
with the matter. He assigned the bill to
Mulligan md the subsequent events WITS
entirely that pentlÂ«man's affair. Mulli
ivs he could have "wiped the floor
with Ferguson with one hanÂ«l." A war
rant for Ferguson's arrest for assault and
battery will probably be the outcome of
the difficulty.
CITY TO FINISH THE HALL.
Irritated at Bateman Brothers'
6istent Demands for Delay.
The Public Building Committee of the
, Board of Supervisors yesterday consid
j ered the proposition of taking away the
contract for finishing the Hall of Justice
I from Bateman Brothers, a* outlined In
i Wednesday's Call, and decided to refer
i the matter to the City and County Attor
ney for his opinion as to the powers of
the board to turn the building over to the
architects for completion. It is under
stood that the board at its meeting next
Tuesday will vote to take the latter
course, as the members are tired of the
dilatory tactics employed by the con
tractors.
Mayor Phelon was present and cate
chised Mr. Bateman as to his Intentions
regarding the self-locking and unlocking
: device for the Jail, but he could get no
satisfactory Information. Architect Shea
stated that considerable work remained
yet to be done In addition to that on the
Jail floor, and steps should be taken Im
! mediately to protect the building. The
request for an extension of fifty days
asked by the Batemans was not recom
mended for passage.
T. I. Bel-gin, president of the Hastings
Law College, appeared before the commit

IN CALIFORNIA'S INTERESTS
Manufacturers' Association Takes Ac
tion in Important '"Matters.
At a meeting of the Manufacturers' and
Producers' Association yesterday the di
rectors took up and discussed several
matters of more than passing moment.
One was that the decision of ttic Treasury
Department, which Is that all shipments
of merchandise In bond Intended for
transshipment by rail through Ihe United
States and thence by steamer from Pacific
Coast ports to foretell countries, must be
subjected 'o examination by United States
customs oflicials. ThÂ« directors ire of
the opinion that such restriction will re
sult as a rcstrnlnt of trade of ti"- Pacific
Coast ports and enforce thÂ« transfer of. .-ill
the business from United States railronds
and steamship linen to those of Cana.la.
A resolution mi passed that the Secre
tary of tfte Treasury be requested to re
consider the matter and Rive .1 more lib
eral construction to the laws governing
export matters.
Another resolution v.as pas-. .1 that tne
Secretary of War be requested to open to
commerce those ports In the Philippines
from which the world obtains Us main
supply of hemp. The present conditions
have seriously decreased th- 1 world's sup
ply. Another matter considered was ins
recent order of the Treasury Department
which compels samples of all tea com
: Ing" from foreign ports to be For wattled to
1 the tea examiner In New York. The dl
; rectors consider that this Is a discrimina
tion against this port and that the order
is entirely unwarranted. TIM Secretary
will be requested to reconsider the order
and restore to the Importers .if San Fran
: cisco the facilities of trade to which they
! are Justly entitled.
Manager Goodwin was Instructed to
I communicate with the Secrotrrv of me
Navy and Chief of the Bureau of 1 Â»<â >< ks
' and Yards urging that the dock at Mare
Island be constructed of stone nnd cement
I Instead of wood as contemplated. Tha
toward home.
"That Is all that I remember. I have
no recollection of having been hit.
have no recollection of meeting my
brother or of being taken home; and It
was not until to-day that I had any
recollection of what I did at the Pacific
Press that day.
"I don"t know whom to suspect, and
have no enemies that I know of. It
might have been robbery, for we are
paid on Monday. I brought my money
home at noon time, so my mother says,
and I had my watch when 1 got home.
There Is no one with whom I have
quarreled or with whom I have been
keeping steady company, so that I do
not kno.v whom to suspect."
Mrs Green and Walter Green fur
nish some additional facts that make
the case one of the most complete
mystery.
"I left the Pacific Press a few min
utes after 6 o'clock," said Mrs. Green.
"My daughter left at twenty-five min
utes past. and myson Walter left about
ten or fifteen minutes later. I reached
home and was preparing dinner when
Walter brought Lennl* home. There
was a groat rut on the back of her
head and she was covered with blood.
She did not know anything, though
she was able to walk and talk, yet her
conversation was without meaning.
Walter was on his way home when he
saw a woman leaning against the cop-
Ing that m rrounds the lot on the cor
ner. He walked up to her to see what
might be the matter, when she spoke
t > him and said. 'Is that you. Walter?'
Walter says that It was then so dark
that he could not recognize his sister
until she spoke, and she now says that
she has not the slightest recollection of
having met him. Walter brought her
home and they got Into the house at
exactly twelve minutes before 7.
"We sent for Dr Pratt and I^ennle
began to talk. She answered our ques
tions, and then when we would repeat
the question a moment later she would
say that she did not know. She did
not know that she had b*en hurt until
late yesterday, when she asked what
the doctor had been to the house f,,r.
At first her memory was completely
gone, but It has been slowly returning
to her. Dr. Pratt says that the brain
and the skull have not been Injured.
We think that robbery was the cause,
for we understand that there is a fang
of men at work in Oakland that would
shoot a man for 10 cents, and I^ennie
got paid on Monday, but brought her
money home at noon time."
The police discredit the robbery
theory and say that It was the work of
some jilted lover who wanted to be
revenged.

MOTORMAN GRAVES IS NOW REALLY
STEPSON-IN-LAW OF HIS FORMER WIFE
GEORGE GRAVES of Elmhurst is now stepfather to hi* own wife, an!
him former wife has become his mother-in-law, for tho tin move In the
Elmhurst matrimonial tangle occurred to-day when the divorced Mr*
Graves married William Rainier at Reno, Nev. It was only a week
ago when Graves was divorced from his wife and married Lillian Rainier, tha
daughter of the man whom he accused of taking from him the affections of
his first wife. This wedding took place In Reno. Nev., because of Graves' re
cent divorce. Now the divorced wife has followed the example of her former
husband and has pone to that western Gretna Oreen and married, a. was
predicted, the man whom Graves said had taken her affections.
Thin leaves the family relations of the party a little tangled. Graves'
present wife Is the stepdaughter of his first wife, .in.l Graves has beeorof the
ex-husband and the â¢n-ln-law of his first wife. while tn* woman who iuc
cceded the first Mrs. Graves and became Mr*. Graves No. 2 Is now the
stepdaughter of the woman whom she supplanted.
On the other hand, Graves becomes the son-in-law of the man who stole
the affections of his first wife, and his first wife becomes his mother-in
law. Whether she will be able to take advantage of the traditional mother
in-law tactics and make it unpleasant for her son-in-law and former husbaml
remains to be seen. As stepmother of the girl who married her former hus
band Mrs. Rainier, formerly Graves, might be expected to have something to
say about the family of her former husband, but It Is quitÂ© likely that the
revised couples will settle down In Klmhurst and be satisfied that Judge â¢ .<
den. who thinks that a husband could stay out nights If he so wished,
granted them the divorce that enabled this new matrimonial tangle.

Inquest on the Body of
Peter Lorraine.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
BAN RAFAEL. Dec. 20.â "The deceased
came to his death from causes unknown."
With thla verdict the Jury In the Inquest
held on the body of Peter Lorraine, in
Coroner Eden's office to-day, closed the
final chapter in tho Carson Canyon mys
tery.
The most Important testimony of the
day was that offered by Charley Mechi
ani, tho aged Frenchman whose frequent
quarrels with the deceased woodchopper
were, during the latter's lifetime, the talk
of tho while camp. He told of his last
meeting with suspect James Dler, in
which Dier, speaking of "French Pete's"
mysterious disappearance, had used the
significant words. "You had trouble with
him. too." Pier's quarrelsome and re
vengeful disposition waa brought out in
this witness' testimony.
Pedro Sals, tho Indian who found the
body, described its appearance at the time
of his discovery, and several other wit
nesses offered unimportant and meager
details of the deceased s life.
The general conviction among the wlt
.â¢â¢d to be that James Dler was
the man who had done Lorraine to death I
Dr. Jones, the county physician, stated'
that the remains were entirely devoid of
.'insisting merely of bones hold to
gether by the clothing and shreds of dried j
tendons. The clothea were discolored in j
; by what appeared to be blood
stains. There was a slash extending '
through the jumper, overshirt and under- j
garment, which might have been caused '
l'\ a. bullet, or by a knife thrust.
Sheriff Will P. Taylor advanced It as
his firm opinion that the deceased had j
met his death at the hands of Dler. He ;
al?o stated that descriptions and photo- I
graphs of the suspect had been scatter- I
ed broadcast orer the State and that I
every effort will be made to apprehend
him.
Tho Jurors who brought In the verdict
were :
S IC Augustine (foreman), L. A. Lan
cel. Dr. G. G. Vaiulerllp, F. L. Gray. ,
Charles Bhader. Prank Baptist, Jacob ;
Blum, G. W Whippier. W. H. Downing.

Â«-d and that the only opposition to his

i claimed as sure recruits. Efforts to as
j certain the names of the uncertain eleven
meet with no response.
From the yellow building the confiden
tial Information Is Imparted to political
workers In Los Angeles. San Diego,
Shasta and Humboldt counties that Burns
has gained fifteen supporters since the
Legislature adjourned, and that the orig
inal thirty, together with these fifteen,
will swing the caucus into line for the
railroad's candidate. The same old tac
tics of bluffing and claiming which were
resorted to last winter In order to cheer
up the desponding thirty are again
brought Into play.
It will be recollected that Burns' open
consent to become a candidate for Sena
tor was not announced until within a
few days of the time, for the Legislature
to assemble. It was openly proclaimed
that he was Ihe choice of the Southern
Pacific, but he withheld the personal dec
laration of his candidacy bo that mem
bers couid not be Instructed before leav
ing their homes to vote against him. He
conducted a dark lantern campaign with
the hope of corraling the Legislature bo
fore the people were apprised of the dan
ger.
Conditions have changed since the reg
ular session campaign opened. Burns Is
now an avowed candidate. Grant. Barnes
and Bulls are no longer In the field. The
Call understands that Thomas R. Bard.
Irving M Scott and John A. Barham are
| candidates. The extra session may not
be called for several weeks. There Is
ample time for Republican voters to come
together In the various Assembly districts
I and announce their choice of candidates.
I No doubt railroad agents are working In
the dark to secure signatures of Indorse
ment here and there for Burns; hence It
Is time for decent Republicans to be on
the alert.
Burns cannot put forward the claim at
the extra session that he is th.Â» candidate
of the Republican party. The Republican
State Central Committee will not ajraln
establish headquarters at Sacramento to
assist the colonel. Dibble will no! be
privileged to refer to Burns us the candi
date of the "organization."
McLaughiin since his dethronement
j from power has had a severe attack of
cold feet, and will not sound the horn of
the railroad in the corridors of the Cap
j itol.
Burns will simply be the railroad's can
didate, and Barham, Scott, Bard or some
' other reputable public man will be the
candidate of the Republican party. It Is
time now for Republicans throughout the
State to Instruct their representatives in
; the Legislature.

KEMP AND HIS
HENCHMEN HAVE
ANOTHER GAME
Substitutes to Be Put
on Regular List.
ENOUGH VOTES ARE CLAIMED
Plan to Create Regular Teachers
Abandoned, but by General Pro
motions Room Will Be
Made for Many More.
School Director William A. Kemp has
not given up hope or filling the School De
' partment crock full of new teachers. Al
, though bis latest schemes to that end
have failed he has proved himself equal
to the occasion and evolved another
which, he confidently claims, will go
i through with seven votes at the next
meeting of the Board of Education.
The plan of Kemp this time Is not to
I make now substitutes nor to increase the
unasslgned-llst. On the contrary he in
tends, with the votes he Claims, to make
each duly elected teacher of the twenty
five now on the substitute list regular ped
agogues in the department.
In this plan (.'onion and Colo are with
him and so also, he alleges. Is Dr. Gedge,
the contracting agent of the department.
Armstrong is a doubtful quantity, but
Kemp is figuring upon his vote and .says
if he does not get It there will be 'some
i thing doing" In the way of charges that
I will make the Armstrong hair stand on
1 end.
Two meetings ago Kemp offered to the
board a resolution doing away with sec
tions 165 to 169 of the rules. If his motion
had been adopted it would have resulted
In the unloading upon the department of
two teachers each for every member of
the solid seven. As It was fixed before
that meeting there was nothing to threat
en the success of the Job. but after Â«he
meeting was called to order President
Bergerot. who had previously agreed to
stand in. attempted to make a grand
stand play to the Mayor and his fellow
members by exposing the whole proposi
tion and refusing to vote as he had prom
ised. As a consequence Mr. Kemp's
teachers were not appointed.
Bergerot's play was a good one from a
politician's standpoint, but as president of
the board he overlooked one Important
parliamentary point. He declared Kemps
resolution out of order when. in fact it
was regularly introduced and entitled to
regular consideration. At the last meet
ing Director Head called the motion up
In order to defeat it. Kemp demurred with
the claim that the motion should not be
again called up until he saw fit. Bergerot
got off wrong again by declaring the mo
tion out of order, notwithstanding that
Head, not Kemp, the mover, had called It
up. and as a consequence Kemp and his
backers claim the resolution Is still a ive
before the board. .::, ":,,:â¢
However, they will not Insist upon its
consideration. Instead, at the next meet
ing. Kemp will ask permission to with
draw it and will offer Instead â  motion to
make all of the teachers now on the sub
stitute list regular teachers In the â¢de
partment at regular teachers' salaries
His motion will not meet with such dis
favor as lid his original resolution for the
reason that all of the substitutes now In
the department are employed In tilling 'he
positions of regular teachers who ire off
on leaves of absence and in such capacity
are really doing regular teachers' work
Owing to the gradual clean-up which Su
perintendent Webster has been making
there Is now no room in the department
for twenty-bix new teachers, either regu
lar or on the substitute list. It was Web
, ster s intention to. hold the appointment
!of them ever until the charter board
should como into office, but Kemp and his
crowd got hold of the matter and 1 are re
i solved to appoint the twenty-six them
selves if they can get the votes to do it
and It is this game they will try to work
through at the next meeting of the board
j and they claim to have the votes.

ATTACKED HIS
MOTHER-IN-LAW
WITH A PISTOL
A Murderous Act of
Fred Mead.
MRS. POWERS HIS ACCUSER
Deserted by His Wife, He Goes
Gunning for Her Parent
and Lands in
Jail.
Fred Mead, a young man who gives his
occupation as that of a machinist, was
arrested last night and charged with
threatening to kill his wife and Mrs. Pow
ers, his mother-in-law. About a week ago
Mrs. Mead left her husband on account
of his ill treatment and returned to her
mother's house at 42S Clementina street.
Suspecting that his mother-in-law had
Influenced his wife to leave him. Mead
swore to be revenged. Last Tuesday he
sent a note to his wife In which he said
that ho was In the City Prison, charged
with robbei and asking her to visit him.
Suspecting that the note was Bent as a
ruse to get the young: woman out of the
house, Mrs. Power* advised her daughter
not to see him. She Is firmly convinced
that Mead's object in trying to get an
Interview with his wife was to get her
away from the house and either kill her
or compel her to return to him.
Shortly after 9 o'clock last night Mead
stood In front of his mother-in-law's home,
flourishing a revolver and threatening to
murder the entire family. Mrs. Powers,
becoming alarmed bolted the door and
otherwise prepared to resist the threat
ened attack of her son-in-law. While she
was cogitating over the advisability of
summoning the police. Mead made an on
slaught on the door, but failed to force
it open. After roundly cursing the fright
ened Inmates, Mead thrust his revolver
through an aperture in the window, and
pointing it at Mrs. Powers started to pull
the trigger. With a wild scream of alarm
Mrs. Powers rushed to the rear and
lustily shouted for help. Mead, evidently
fearing arrest, hurriedly left the scene,
after threatening to return and wipe out
the entire family. As he walked down
the street Mrs. Powers, accompanied by
her two daughters, started after him. In
tending to turn him over to the first po
liceman they met. After following him
for a short distance they espied Officers
Esola and Owens, to whom they appealed
to arrest Mead. The latter, seeing that
he could not escape, threw his revolver
and a razor Into a vacant lot. The weap
ons were recovered by the officers and
booked as evidence against the irate son
in-law.
Mrs. Powers says that she will swear
out a warrant against Mead to-day,
charging him with an assault* with a
deadly weapon.

The County Hospital is not a Christmas
scene, there is nothing to indicate good
will toward men, and only such visits
as that made by the California Club pre
vent the inmates from feeling absolutely
forsaken. Many are M near their jour
ney's end that they will never receive an
other Christmas present and to them the
kind word, the bon bon and the few red
berries left at the foot of the bed were
priceless treasures.
In ward H is little Ruth, â  child of

within the last few months I paid Dack

confidence in the future, and was satisr:ed
that I would pull through in good shape.

life I find myself penniless and forced j
