WAR SAID TO HAVE BEEN BEGUN BY
THE BOERS IN NATAL.
KRUGER SENDS MESSAGE
THAT WAR IS CERTAIN
CHICAGO, Oct. ILâ The following cablegram was received to-night by
the Chicago Tribune from President Kxuger of the Transvaal Republic.
The cablegram was sent In answer to a message from the Tribune request
ing a statement of the position of the Transvaal in the present crisis. In
the cablegram, which follows, small words have been filled in In order to
make smoother reading:
PRETORIA, Oct. 11. Tribune, Chicago: Through the
Tribune -we -wish to thank our many American friends for sympa
thy in the present crisis of the republic. Last Monday -we gave
England forty-eight hours' notice 'within 'which to give assurance
that the dispute will be settled by arbitration or ether peaceful
means. The notice expires at 5 to-day. The British agent is recalled
and war is certain- This is the fitting end of the British policy of
force and fraud which has marked all South Africa with the blood of
Afrikanders. We must now make South Africa free or the white
man's grave. The republic's forces include -.1 nationalities, among
them a strong American corps, showing it is not a case of Boer
against TJitlander. but all nations against the English. We have
full faith in freedom and republicanism, in the righteousness -which
guides the destinies of nations. PRESIDENT KRUGER.
An answer cf ten words from the Tribune to President Kruger giving
the time of the receipt of the message in Chicago was prepaidâ the peo
ple In Pretoria being evidently somewhat apprehensive that the message
might not get through.
LI Ladysmith,
dated Wednesday, alone among the
specials received declares that war .
has been begun by the Boers in
Natal. The correspondent says:
"Free State burghers have seized a train |
at Harrysmith. which was the property
of the Natal Government. Last night a
mounted patrol was stoned by Boers, j
The men's orders were not to fire unless
they were fired upon."
The other dispatches only represent that
hostilities are imminent. '
CONYNGHAM GREENE.
LONDON, Oct. 11â It is rumored that Cor.yngham Greene, the British
diplomatic agent at Pretoria, has been assassinated there. The report, how
ever, is unconfirmed and is discredited at the Colonial Office.
A dispatch from Glencoa Camp dated
Wednesday noon says the burghers are
reported to be beyond the .President's
ccntrol and hostilities are expected. at
any moment.
A dispatch from Newcastle. Natal, says
that at a meeting held there in the in
terest of peace, a crowd of patriots in
vaded the hall, stormed the platform and
moved and carried a resolution to support
the Government In the war. The police
were called upon to restore order and
finally cleared the hall.
The Daily Mail's Berlin correspondent
says: "General Benjamin Harrison, for
mer President of the United States, de
clared to me to-day that he sighted
breakers ahead for the British ship of
state."
The military authorities In South Af
rica have Instituted a censorship over all
telegrams in order to prevent Informa
tion regarding British movements from
reaching the Boers.
DURBAN, Oct. 11â Authentic Informa
frcm Ladysmith confirms the report that
it is the intention of the Boers to occupy
Newcastle immediately.
CAPE TOWN, Oct. 11â The i respond -
ent at Sar.dspruit of the South African
News telegraphs late Tuesday evening as
follows: "Owing to Intelligence received
during the day war appears to be more
remote."
No precise Information is obtainable
here, but there is good reason to believe
that the correspondent's statement is
correct.
COMMUNICATION WITH
TRANSVAAL NOW CUT
LONDON. Oct. li.â Nothing since this
has been received from Pretoria, and
doubtless the telegraphic communication
with the Trar.svaai is now cut. The ab
sence of news from the Cape since early
morning is not due to an interruption of
the cable, but to the immense pressure
of work, the cables probably being nearly
monopolized by British Government dis
patches, which take precedence over all
others. Only two cables run to Cape
Town from Europe., and the one on the
eastern coast is very slow, so that prac
tically ail the work is thrown on one At
lantic cable,. which means that the pres
ent exasperating delay will recur repeat
edly during the progress of the war and
that the newspaper dispatches will prob
ably be very meager.
PREPARATIONS FOR
BULLER`S DEPARTURE
LONDON, Oct. 11â Great preparations'
The San Francisco Call.
are being made at Southampton for the
departure on Saturday of General Sir Red
vers Builer, and a great demonstration is
anticipated. The Duke of Connaught, the
Duke of York. Lord Lansdowne, General
Lord Wolseley and General Sir Evelyn
Wood are expected to accompany him to
Southampton from London. It Is an
nounced that the fleet of transports con
veying Sir Redvers Buller's army corps
will be escorted by warships, while fur
ther dispatch boats and gunboats will be
sent to South African waters.
The Government has already expended
Â£3.'Â» in naval and military prepara
tions, the orders placed with contractors
this week alone amounting to Â£300.000. The
authorities, anticipating a serious reduc
tion a the output of the South African
coal mines, have ordered 3000 tons of Eng
lish steam coal to be sent to the Cape
for the use of the warships.
The outbreak of war has sent up the
Price of English wheat, and on various
markets the farmers have refused to sen
wheat under 30 shillings per quarter, in
some cases even holding out for a still
higher price.
A dispatch from Kimberly says Cecil
Rhodes is expected there shortly. *
BRITISH STATESMEN PUT
BLAME ON THE BOERS
LONDON. Oct. 11â A flood of oratory

This --ace is near Dundee, and where the advanced British forces, 4000 strong, are stationed. It may be the scene of the first heavy fighting, when hostilities beg in in earnest.
SAN FRANCISCO. THURSDAY, OCTOBER 12, 1899.
NEW SOUTH WALES LANCERS WHO HAVE JUST SAILED FOR
SOUTH AFRICA. Â£i Â» â â - - -
on the Transvaal situation burst out to
night. A. J. Balfour, â¢ First Lord of the
Treasury; Henry Herbert Asqulth, former
Home Secretary, and others spoke In vari
ous parts of the country. Sir Michael
Hicks-Beach, Chancellor of the Ex
chequer, who was to have delivered an
address on the subject, is suffering from
an attack of bronchitis and was unable
to speak. Mr. Balfour, addressing the
Unionists of Haddington, said:
"The crisis In South Africa has now
reached the stage where diplomacy is put
aside, argument ceases to make further
place and appeal is made to arms. Peace
and good will among men, which it Is
our first business to cultivate in all of
Great Britain's vast possessions, has been
wantonly and gratuitously imperiled by
the rash policy of the Boer Government.
"A great change has taken place in the
past three months in the opinion of this
country regarding our South African
policy. There was not then the clear
conviction which now exists respecting
the true merits of the case which is now
to be decided by the arbitrament of force,
but the more the public has known of
what the Government has done and what
they aimed at the more they have come
around to the view that the Government,
If they have erred at all, have erred on
the side of patience. Those who supported
us can look back to the long, anxious
months with the conscientious conviction
that we earnestly desired peace, though
war was imminent, and that though at
the moment I am speaking war may
actually have begun, that war is none of
our seeking, none of our desire, but is
forced upon us by those who are not men
fighting for the freedom of their country,
but oligarchy, who fear that the hour of
their domination is at an end.
"Now that the prospects of peace are
finally destroyed, now that war with all
its consequences, all Its loss of life, all
Its destruction of property, all Its suffer
ings, is on us, we can say we have never
asked anything but justice, never desired
anything but freedom, all we longed for
was equality under the Transvaal re
public toward men of our race and speech,
which we freely gave to the men of the
Dutch race and speech In the neighboring
colonies, and if they think It worth while
to Imperil their future in order, to refuse
these rights, at all events the blame rests
on them and not on us. and we : can feel
that, whatever we may have to endure
before the war is brought to a final con
clusive and successful Issue, the sacrifices
we shall be called upon to make are
sacrifices In the Interests of the rights of
men and of civilization." (Prolonged
cheers.)
Mr. Balfour concluded his speech with
an expression of thanks to the audience
for their approval of the Government's
policy.
Mr. Asquith. speaking at the Dundee,
credited the Government with a sincere
and honest desire to avoid ,war. It
seemed Incredible, he said, that the other
should strike the first blow in a conflict
which could have but one issue. The
handling of the problem by the Boers was
such as no civilized country could permit
and the issue raised by the Transvaal's
ill-starred dispatch was one from which
Great Britain could not shrink, but was
bound to take up.
The vast majority of the British peo
ple, Mr. Asquith declared, contemplated
the war with reluctance and aversion, and
saw In it little or no prospect either of
advantage or military glory. It was not
with a light heart that they took up the
challenge, but now that it was forced
upon them, they would see it through.
â¢ Right Hon. William St. John Broderick,
Under Secretary of State for Foreign Af
fairs, announced In a speech at Guilford
that the Government had made the only
possible reply to the Transvaal, namely,
that "we are not prepared to discuss such
terms."
AMERICANS EXPRESS
SYMPATHY WITH BOERS
NEW YORK. Oct. 11.â great mass
meeting was held in Carnegie Hall to- j
night to express sympathy with the Boers !
In their controversy with Great Britain, j
The flag of the Transvaal republic hung '
side by side with the stars and stripes. !
The colors of the Orange Free State were !
also displayed. On the platform and in
the ampitheater were gathered men of all '
'hales of political faith. Many women
were present.
Augustus .Van Wyck, who was the Dem
ocratic candidate for Governor in oppo
sition to Roosevelt, presided. A number
of societies were represented, including
the Daughters of the American Revolu
tion, Sons of the Revolution, Society of
Colonial Dames. Order of the Loyal Le
gion. Holland Society, Holland Dames and
the United Irish Societies. Among those
present were General James R. O'Beirne,
who recently was appointed representa
tive of the Been in this country. The
long list of vice presidents Includes Gov
ernor Pingree of Michigan, Senator Mason
of Illinois. Senator Piatt of New York and
Senator Teller of Colorado..
Van -Wyck made a speech In which he
characterized the pending struggle as one
of the strong against the weak.
Bourke Cockran then took the platform
and was received with a tremendous ova
tion. He spoke for an hour, and while the
applause - was cyclonic at times, there
were a good many interruptions on the
part of several, hundred English sympa
thizers who occupied seats in the rear
of the uall and in the galleries. Mr.
Cockran went into detail on the relations
between the two contending nation,
spoke of England's rights In the making
of treaties with the Boers, and added:
"The United States has as much right
to intervene |to prevent aggression and
preserve peace as England has for the
gratification of greed and the spoliation
of territory. President Kruger was with
in his rights, and I believe stepped out
side his duty when he consented to dis
cuss the question of citizenship with any
person who should couple it with a
threat. The ostensible reasons assigned
for Mr. Chamberlain's policy are so inad
equate that we are compelled to look for
the real reasons elsewhere. Why is it
that the peace of the world Is endangered
on such a flimsy pretense?
"The answer is on the tongue of every
Englishman, but it suggests such reck
lessness, such heedless moral depravity,
that I would not undertake to formulate
it. Let an Englishman answer jit and it
proclaims the Infamy of their Govern
ment.

AMERICAN OFFICIALS HOPE
THAT WAR MAY BE AVERTED
CALL HEADQUARTERS. WELLINGTON HOTEL, WASHINGTON, Oct.
While prepared to protect British Interests in the South African Repub
lic as far as consistent with its policy of strict neutrality, the administra
tion Is hopeful that war may at the last moment be averted. Just how
this will be accomplished cannot be Indicated here, but officials cognizant of
the situation say the fact of Queen Victoria's opposition to war and of
the great pressure brought to bear on England both at home and abroad,
though not of a governmental character, may result in concessions. In dip
lomatic circles, however. it is apparent that Great Britain's simple acknowl
edgment of the Boer ultimatum indicates a purpose to place upon Kruger's
Government the responsibility of forcing hostilities, and foreign represent
atives here do not doubt that to-morrow morning's papers will record a posi
tive announcement of the Boer's advance.
As soon as war breaks out Cons Macrum will be instructed to notify
the Secretary of State for the Transvaal that the British Government has
requested the United States to protect its interests in South Africa: that it
is the purpose of the United States to be strictly neutral, and that if not
objectionable to the Transvaal Government this Government will act for
Great Britain. The British -Government has not formally requested the
President to act as indicated^ though Mr. Tower, the British Charge, had
another conference to-day with Acting Secretary of State Hill. The author
ities appreciate Great Britain's desire, -d the Salisbury administration un
derstands the intention of the United Rates to comply with it. Correspond
ence concerning the protection of Spanish subjects and interests In the
United States by diplomatic and consular officers of France and Austria-
Hungary during the war with Spain Indicates the policy which the admin
istration will pursue in protecting British Interests in the Transvaal. The
archives of British consulates will be turned over to Consul Macrum and his
commercial agents.
When John Sherman was Secretary of State he received from Embassa

notification that their Gov juts had been charged with the projection of
Spanish interests. To their :es he made this identical reply: "In reply I
beg to inform you that the Government of the United States c.dmits
your friendly action in assuming charge of the protection of Spanish sub
jects and interests In the United States. It is, of course, understood, in con
formity with international usage which obtains in circumstances like the
present, that the present arrangement contemplates only the friendly of
fices of yourself and your esteemed colleagues, as well as Consular represen
tatives of your respective nations, should occasion therefore arise with re
gard to Spanish subjects and inter- actually within the jurisdiction of the
United States and embraces no representative office by either of you on be
half of the Government of Spain, between which Government " and the
United States, a condition of war unhappily exists."
Advises just received from Consul Macrum show that he Is confident
that American interests will not become dangerously Involved, though both
he and the State Department appreciate that if an American or his in
terests should get in the path of hostilities damage Is hkelv to follow. The
Boers, notwithstanding the fact that they have a law which permits im
pressment of aliens to their army in the event of war. have announced that
Americans will not be commandered, which is naturally very gratifying to
this Government. In view of this comparative lack of danger to Americans
and their interests, and the purpose of this Government to impress upon the
Kruger Government its intention to be strictly neutral, the authorities recon
sidered to-day their intention to send the Montgomery to South Africa, and
she will be retained in American waters for the present.
shouted Mr. Cockran, "I defy any man to
find an Instance where war has been
based upon reasons as atrocious as this."
Mr. Cockran eulogized President Kru
ger, who was cheered.
."â "lt has been said." he continued, "that
while the President of the United States
sympathizes with the Transvaal, yet he

He declared his belief that if England
goes to war with the Transvaal the
United States will forcibly advance her
claims regarding the Alaskan boundary.
These resolutions were adopted:
"Resolved, That this meeting having
considered the difficulty which has arisen
between Great Britain and the South
African republic, and having examined
the relation of these two States, as de
fined by the convention of ISO and 1354, Is
of the opinion that Great Britain does not
possess any right of intervention in the
internal affairs of the South African re
public either by treaty or by international
law.
"Resolved, That this meeting is also of
the opinion that the South African re
public, although not bound to comply
with any of the demands of Great Brit

leges, and that, therefore, it is the duty
of Great Britain not to force a conflict
in South Africa, but either to accept the

"Resolved, That a copy of these reso
; lutions be transmitted to the Govern-
I ment of the United States, to the Gov
ernment of Great Britain and to the
Government of the South African repub
lic."
It had been rumored around the hall
that the meeting would break up in a
seething mass of people burning a
Union Jack. It was expected by the
plotters that pandemonium would reign.
At the end of the meeting a man in the
rear of the hall, with a few followers as
a bodyguard, seized a Union Jack that
was hoisted there and tore it to shreds.
Then he turned to run and was thrown
out of the hall by the police.
MEN OF MANY RACES
MAY FIGHT BRITONS
LONDON. Oct. 11- A telegram from
Pretoria timed 7:30 yesterday evening
says: The situation is becoming hourly
more critical. Numerous Americans,
Germans, French, Swedes, Belgians, Nor
wegians, Danes. Italians, ' Dutchmen,
Swiss and Cape Afrikanders have gone to
the border to fight for the Transvaal, al
though they are not burghers, while many
British residents also have taken the oath
of allegiance. The hope is expressed by
many that war will yet be averted.
LORD ROSEBERY ,JOW
EXPRESSES HIS VIEWS
LONDON, Oct. Lord Rosebery. the
former Premier and Liberal leader, has
finally declared his position relative to
the South African question. In a letter
under to-day's date he says:
"I have maintained silence because I am
loth to re-enter politics. To-day, how
ever, I can speak without touching poli
tics, for a situation has been created
which is. beyond party polemics. I think
there is ; much in the last three years of
our returns with the Government of the
Transvaal to criticize if not condemn, but
that is ' all over for the present. It is
needless to discuss how we could best
have attained our simple and reasonable
object of rescuing our fellow countrymen
in the Transvaal from intolerable condi
tlors of subjection and injustice and of
securing equal rights for the white races
in South Africa: for" an ultimatum has
been addressed to Great Britain by the
South African republic which is itself a
declaration of war.
"In the face of this attack upon the na
tion the people will undoubtedly close
their ranks and relegate party controver
sies to a more convenient season. There
Is one more word to be said. Without at
tempting to judge the policy which con
cluded a peace after the reverse at Ma
juba Hill, I am bound to state my pro
found conviction that there is no con
ceivable Government in this country
which could reseat it." <T -.~2
WARFARE OF THE PAST AND PRESENT
STORY OF THE LAST
BOER-BRITISH WAR
Conditions Have Changed and This Cam
paign Cannot Be So Easllij Won hg
Kruger's Forces,
THE Boers have little ground for hope that the war into which they are
Just now plunging will be so quickly terminated as when they last braved
and beat the British forces on their borders in 1881. Nor can they well ex
pect that the course and finish of the affair will be as favorable to them as
in that instance. Eighteen years have made many chancres In the situa
tion. The Transvaal Is no longer an almost Inaccessible country, ap
proachable from the nearest British seaport by but one difficult route over the
rugged Drakenberg Mountains. Now three railroad lines enter the country, one
from the Portuguese port at Delagoa Bay on the east, a second from the British
Tort Durban (Port Natal) on the southeast, and a third from points In Cape
Colony crosses the Orange Free State and enters the Transvaal from the south,
while still another, the Cape-Kimberly-Mafaeking-Bulawayo line, all in British
territory, skirts the whole length of the western border of the Boer country.
Except on the east, where. the Transvaal touches the Portuguese, the two Boer
states are entirely surrounded by British territory, more or less well settled and
as well fitted for fighting as the Boers themselves.
The last trouble began In December, 1880, and lasted but eight weeks, during
which the Boers, though generally far outnumbered, met and defeated some of
the very best veteran troops In the British army, and on March 21 dictated their
own terms to the British commander, Sir Evelyn Wood, at O'Neill's farm, be
tween Majuba Hill and Newcastle, as the price of the safety of his army.
The British flag had been raised and British sovereignty asserted In the
Transvaal by Sir Theophilus Shepstone, a British Commissioner, in 1877, and
ifter nearly three years of vain protests and pleas for the restoration of their
ights and Independence, guaranteed in solemn treaty and convention at Sand
River In 1864, the Boers broke out in open rebellion. . * .
Their opportunity came in 'he latter part of 1880, when there were com
paratively few British troops In the Transvaal, distributed as garrisons In the
more Important towns. On November 11 a number of Boers Interfered and pre
vented the execution of a magistrate's process at Potchefstrom and the trouble
was begun. British troops were sent to the scene and made an unsuccessful at
tempt to arrest the ringleaders of the affair. It was then seen that a col
lision was near at hand.
On December 13 a mass-meeting of Boers at Heidelberg proclaimed - the
Transvaal once more a republic, established a triumvirate government and pre
pared to defend their republic by force of arms.
This news aroused the Cape Government to the- seriousness of the situation
and troops were at once put in motion to crush the rebellion In the bud. On
December 20 Colonel Anstruther. with 250 men of the Ninety-fourth Regi
ment, on the way to reinforce the garrison at Pretoria, was attacked en route,
when two days' march beyond Ollphants River, and the whole party either
killed or captured. On a rising ground near Brankhorst Spruit an armed body
of Boers made their appearance ami a man galloped out from them with a flag
of truce, bearing a sealed dispatch for Colonel Anstruther. warning him that
the British advance would be considered a declaration of war. Anstruther re
plied that he was ordered to go to Pretoria and should do so. The Boer pal
loped back to his party and the fight, if fight it could be called, begun. The
Boers were good marksmen and on rising ground, behind trees and rocks, had
the British at their mercy. In ten minutes every officer had fallen, some forty
men were killed and nearly one hundred wounded. Colonel Anstruther. him
self bauly wounded, saw that he must surrender or lose every man and he
surrendered. . Â
The next fighting was across the Natal border, and on the same ground thai
will very likely be the scene of further battling in the next few weeks, in case
the British m â â 'â â¢ forward to the border. Sir George Collev was advancing with
a strong column of troops from Port Natal by way of Pietermaritzhurg ate; New
castle to th" border, when he encountered a force of Boers at Laings Neck on
February 1* and was badly defeated, with the loss of a large numb, of men.
including nearly every officer on the firing line, who were made especial marks
by the Boers. Falling back to Ingoyo River he was followed by the enemy and
again badly handled. Officer after officer went down before the unerring aim
of the enemy, while the British fire did little damage, and they could get no
opportunity to use the bayonet.
The last and worst defeat of all was vet to come to the Britishâ the disas
trous and humiliating affair of Majuba Hill. Sir Evelyn Wood had arrived at
Port Natal with reinforcements, and was hurrying them to the front when the
blow fell that forced him to sue for peace.
On the night of January 2s. 1881 . Sir George Colley, with the Gordon High
landers and some other troops, moved out from his camp at Prospect Hill and
occupied the summit of Majuba Hill, five miles beyond and some MOO feet above
the river bed. Early the next morning the enemy attacked his position. There
was some desultory firing, under the cover of which three storming parties of
Boers ascended the hill almost unseen by the British, who outflanked and sur
rounded were at once subjected to a deadly fire from all sides. The slaughter
was terrible. The officers were soon all shot down. Including Sir George Colley
himself, and the men broke and fled. Some escaped and a large number were
taken prisoners. Such a defeat has seldom fallen upon the British arms. The
war was over.
General Sir Evelyn "Wood came upon the scene soon after and proposed an
armistice, which was followed on March 21 by his signing a treaty of peace on
the basis proposed by Kruger and his colleagues.
Tt is said that the real object of Lord
Rosebery*s silence until to-day was to
lead President Kruger to believe that
Lord Rosebery and his followers might
come to the assistance of the Transvaal,
thus stiffening President Kruger's back
to resist British demands. According to
this explanation Lord Rosebery's fear has
been that President Kruger would yield,
which from his Lordship's point of view
would have been fatal, as he is fully con
vinced that the only road to permanent
peace is the defeat of the Boers.

footing, and was even titer; prepared to
consider a definite suggestion of the ter
mination of the crisis. In another dis- j
patch he says:
"My object In all communications since I
October 2 has been to leave nothing un- !
done to prevent such action on the part
of the Transvaal as Is calculated to make j
a pacific solution finally Impossible. I I
cannot, however, ask the imperial Govern
ment for a pledge, either regarding the
disposition of troops in British territory
in South Africa or their dispatch from
other parts of the empire."
President Steyn replied
"The reasons for arming the Transvaal
were the presence of an alien, hostile
population In its midst, which was always
stirring up hatred and endeavoring for
political or financl? ' reasons to undermine
the independence of the State. The Boers

GARRISON WELL ABLE
TO HOLD ITS OWN
CAPE TOWN. Oct. 11. -There is little
fear with regard to the possibility of a
successful Boer attack upon Cape Colony.
It is believed that the garrison is well able
to hold Its own. The fact is recalled that
in 1881, when the British were standing on
the defensive, they were almost invariably
successful.
In a debate in the Cape House of As
sembly last evening regarding the allega
tions of Boer maltreatment of refugees
from the Transvaal, the Premier, Mr.
Schreiner, implored the House not to be
lieve the newspapers In this particular.
"So far as I Know," he said, "there is
no truth in the statement that the Orange
Free State Railway officials have commit
ted brutal assaults on British passengers,
and officials deny these statements."
On the other hand, the reports of out
rages and insult are plentifully corrob
orated.
BIG GUN POSTED
ON THE NATAL BORDER
PRETORIA. Oct. 11. The German de

and almost inaccessible activity.
The Official Gazette to-day contains the
confiscation law, approved by the Volks
raad September 29, adopting the mining
article in the gold taw, enacted last year,
empowering the Government to confiscate
claims and mines belonging to persons
convicted of treason or conspiracy against

OTTAWA, Ontario, Oct. 11.â response
to intimations that the Canadian Govern
ment would furnish a military contingent
for service in the Transvaal a cablegram
has been received from the "War Office

Fruit-Pickers Scarce.
SALINAS, Oct. 11.â Fruit-packers in
this locality are much worried over their
Inability to got a sufficient number of
pickers. All .the orchardlsts have been
working short-handed this season. Al
though white labor has been given pref
erence, yet it is hard to procure. The

Car Derailed.
GILROY, Oct. 11.â A car loaded with
horses was derailed at the Gllroy station

paired.
THE SA.N FEAKCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, OCTOBER 12. 1899.
TORONTO, Ontâ Oct. 11.â Friends
of the Boers attempted about 10
o'clock to-night to burn down
that part of Toronto fort In
which Is stored the equipment for
Ontario and the western section of
the South African contingent. The
equipment was ready to hand out
at a moment's notice. An officer on
going the rounds saw a fire and
with help extinguished it just in
time, for in a few minutes the
interior would have been blazing.
An investigation showed that rags
and paper saturated with oil had
been piled 'up against the wood
work â¢ and fired. The police and
pickets are hunting for the incen
diaries suspected and quadruple
guards are now on duty. The Gov
ernment will offer a reward for the
discovery of the criminal.
MAY INVALIDATE
SAN RAFAEL ORDINANCES
Unique Contention Filed in an
Answer to a Suit for
Damages.
SAN RAFAEL, Oct. 11â answer to' a
suit for damages was filed In the Superior
Court to-day which, if the contentions
therein contained stand the test of the
law, will invalidate one-half the ordi
nances of the city. The suit in question
was filed by Helon Hardman and H. A. !
Hardman, her husband, against Millen
Griffith Jr. for damages in the sum of i
$5300 and costs of suit on account of In
juries alleged to have been received by a
bicycle ridden by the youthful defendant
in defiance of a town ordinance.
In the complaint, filed last May, it was
alleged that Millen Griffith had ridden a
wheel on the sidewalks of the city and that j
while so enjoying himself he carelessly
collided with plaintiff and caused injuries
of a nature which necessitated her taking
to her bed and being placed under the
care of a physician for some time. The â¢
effect of these Injuries was said to be j
such that Mrs. Hardman averred her
belief that she should be reimbursed for
what she paid for medical attendance and
should receive $6000 for damages.
The answer, tiled by Attorneys Page, :
1 Eels and McCutchenJ denies all the allega- i
tions In the complaint and puts forward ;
'< the claim that the ordinance against bi
cycle riding on sidewalks was adopted
'â â  while San Rafael was a municipal cor
poration of the .sixth class, whereas the i
accident occurred while the town was a :
municipal corporation of the fifth class.
If this contention holds good, all the
police and license ordinances of the town
: would be invalidated. Attorney James
W. Cochrane, representing the plaintiff,
declares the contention to be without
merit and says that it Is absurd to say
that a change In municipal class, which
depends simply upon the census, should .
! render it necessary to readopt any ordi- |
nance.
ATTORNEY TERRILL ON
TRIAL FOR FORGERY
Accused of Delivering Worthless
Deeds in Payment for
Money Due.
SAN JOSE, Oct. 11. -Samuel Is. Terrill,
1 the attorney who has defrauded Santa
Clara County people out of sums aggre
gating $20,000, is on trial before a jury in
: Judge Lorigan's department of the Supe
rior Court, Great Interest centers in the
case, as Terrill's victims number at least
i half a hundred. There are eight Grand
Jury indictments for forgery and embez
zlement hanging over him.
This is tile second trial of Terrill, the
first having resulted in a disagreement on
a charge of defrauding Mrs. Clara A.
Fread of Morgan Hill out of $300.
The offense he is now charged with is
forgery, by which he obtained $400 from
Richard J. Hawke of New Almaden. Ter
rill obtained the money lor the purported
â¢ purpose of loaning it to Conrad Mart.
I He pocketed it, however, and later gave
I Hawke a mortgage signed by Leon Mc-
I Abee and covering two lots In this city as
security. Investigation proved McAbee a
I myth and the instrument a forgery. On
i ins solemn promise to pay he was not
prosecuted. Later he also gave Hawke a
worthless deed to a mine in Tuolumne
; County to quiet him. Terrill also wrote
Hawke a letter acknowledging his guilt,
but begging for clemency.
This- was the substance of Hawke's tes
timony. D. T. Ames, handwriting expert,
testified that the signature Leon McAbee
was that of the same person (Terrill) who
drew up the mortgage.
The case will go on again to-morrow
I and will occupy several days.
TROUBLE OVER A LIBRARY.
Lively Squabble Among San Rafael
Trustees.
SAN RAFAEL. Oct. 11.â A squabble has
arisen among the members of the Board
of Free Library Trustees which threat
ens seriously to impair the usefulness of
that institution. The trouble is all caused
by a desire of Albert Boyen and Attorney
James W. Cochrane, a minority of the
board, to comply with a recent order
adopted by the town Trustees requiring
the library quarters to be removed to cer
tain apartments specially set apart for
that purpose in the new High School
building. These two gentlemen hay*.
the support of the town Trustees, and it
is probable that in the end they will
"win out," although considerable ani
mosity will doubtless be stirred up before
a final settlement is reached.
Owing to the straitened condition of the
city finances the Board of Town Trustees
was unable to appropriate more thai $500
to prepare the apartments in the High
School building for a library, but it Is con
tended both by that body and by Messrs.
Boyen and Cochrane that such a Bum is
ample for the purpose. At a meeting of
the library trustees held las'; evening
lengthy resolutions were presented by
Charles Fish, Attorney Vincent Neal and
Carter P. Pomeroy against moving the
library into the quarters prepared for it,
the principal objection being that at least
$1000 would be required to make the rooms
suitable for a library. They voted in fa
vor of the resolutions and Boyen and
Cochrane against them.
The rental of the rooms in which the
library is contained at present on Fourth
street, near D, is $30 a month, and it is
understood that if the library is not
moved the Town Trustees will refuse to
pay this rental any longer. In such case
the institution will either have to be re
moved or the rent paid by private sub
scription. As the sentiment generally is :
in favor of removal, the burden will in I
all likelihood fail upon the shoulders of
the obstructionists.

DENVER, Oct. 11.â James K. Stratton,
the mailbox robber and forger, has es

CONSUL GENERAL
WHITE DECLARES THE
TRANSVAAL WILL WIN
Scores Chamberlain fop His Folic], Closes
His Office In London and Leaves
for the Continent,
T ONDON, Oct. 11.â Montague White, Consul General of the South African
LONDON, In London, closed the consulate this afternoon and Immediately
Republic in London, closed the consulate this afternoon and immediately
| left for the Continent. 'Â;.'
8 j Mr. White's departure was not attended by any excitement. Before
leaving England he said: "The expected has happened. I only hope the
hellishness of this premeditated crushing out of a hardy republic is now ap
parent. Let me remind America that the onus of war lies not upon those who
fire the first shot, but upon those who compel It to be fired.
"Technically we have temporarily put ourselves In the attitude of an ag
gressor, but who would not have done so when he believed the existence of his
country was at stake? I think we must look far ahead to see the consequences
of this war. Instead of the pacification of South Africa, which Is the alleged
aim of England, we shall have perpetual unrest. These very people for whom
England is now fighting will turn against her rule as bitterly as they are now
protesting against ours.
"For weeks I had seen England's determination to force a hostile Issueâ
rather Mr. Chamberlain's. I am sure he Is the only member of the Cabinet
whose mind was thoroughly made up throughout all the negotiations. What his
intentions were is evident from the situation to-day. Had the franchise been
the chief grievance our five-year proposition would certainly have been accepted.
I have reason to believe that England enters upon her warlike course by no
means a unit. Opposition to Mr. Chamberlain's policy exists to a greater ex
tent than Is generally conceded.
"Our evident desire to conciliate has been much appreciated, and our refusal
to allow our affairs to be administered by another nation has not excited genuine
indignation here or in any quarter of the globe. However, Mr. Chamberlain has
accomplished his purpose and all hope is gone. I believe, nevertheless, that a
considerable reversal in British opinion would be effected by any serious defeat,
for most of those now supporting the Government are doing so with a light
heart and on general principles, not stopping to count the cost of war."
Mr. White cited the Isandlwhama massacre as an Instance of such a
change in British opinion. He then said:
"I suppose there can be only one ultimate result of the hostilities. As to the
duration of the war I am not able to guess. It seems to be a matter of the
greatest. uncertainty. I hear that Great Britain will not begin the wiping out
process until December. In the meantime we shall see what we shall see. I
have received no special instructions or news from the Transvaal during the
last forty-eight hours, and I expect none, having long ago received directions
as to what course for me to take when matters reached this stage. I shall re
main on the Continent, and if anything further can be done to the interest of
my Government, I shall, of course, endeavor to do it, although there seems
nothing left but to fight to the bitter end."
Mr. White seemed much distressed over the lupture, and evidently did not
entertain the least hope of Boer success. He said the Transvaal agency In
Brussels would be continued as the European headquarters of the Government.
Mr. White's reference to the Isandlwhama massacre Is an allusion to the
attack made on January 22, 1879, oy some 15,000 Znius upon the British camp
at Isandula or Isandlwhama, about ten miles from Rorke's Drift, on the
Tugela. Five companies of the Twenty-fourth Regiment with Colonel' Dunford,
Lieutenant Colonel Pulleine, and other officers, were massacred, the British
total loss being about 837. Two thousand Zulus are said to have been killed.
TITLE GAINED BY
SIMPLE PURCHASE
Philippines Not Won by
Conquest.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
COLUMBUS, Oct. 11.â The first public
utterance of Judge William R. Day, who
was president of the American Peace
Commission, concerning the deliberations
of the commissioners at Paris, is con
tained in a letter written to former Con
gressman D. K. Watson of this city and
read by him at a Republican meeting in
this city -night. Judge Day sets forth
the reasons which, in his mind, justified
the payment of $20,000,000 for the Philip
pint declaring that it was never con
tended by the American commissioners
that the United States had a right to the
Philippines as a matter of conquest.
In this letter, after reviewing at length
the long negotiations between the Spanish
and the American peace commissioners,
reciting the several propositions submitted
to the Spaniards for the cession of the
Philippines, and the final offer, for the
sake of securing an immediate peace, to
pay an indemnity of $20,000,000, Judge Day
says :
On the 2 th of November the Spanish Com
missioners accepted the terms offered by the
representatives of the United States. You will
observe that In making this proposal It is dis
tinctly said that it embodied the concessions
which for the sake of Immediate peace the
American Government was willing to make.
There were douhless other reasons actuating
the commissioners in making this proposal,
though I think the chief one is embodied in
the statement above written. It was not
claimed that the United States had a right
to the Philippines as a matter of conquest.
The United States has never undertaken, so
far as I know, to wrest from a foreign coun
try lands or possessions simply by right of con
quest. lit I we been disposed to do so it must
be remembered that we were in possession only
of the city, bay and harbor of Manila under
the protocol of August 12, 1898, providing the
United States should occupy and hold the
same pending the conclusion of a treaty of
peace. which should determine the control, dis
position and government of the Philippines.
The capture after the signing of the protocol,
by General .Y'-rrltt and his forces, whatever its
legal effect may have been, Included no more
territory than we were entitled to hold under
the protocol.
In addition to the hope of accomplishing im
! mediate peace, which. I need hardly say, was

of great importance at that time, there was a
strong desire to treat Spain with a decree of
magnanimity consistent with our national
honor and prestige, following our national pre
cedent in the treatment of Mexico for the ces
sion of territory at the close of the Mexican
war. By the cession for a consideration, we
Obtained an indisputable title which must be
respected by all other nations. It must be re

si!;. had consistently refused any of the
outstanding debts or obligations which Spain
had undertaken to fasten upon the Philippines.
Notwithstanding our offer to pay for pacific
improvements, Spain had not undertaken to
substantiate any claim upon that ground.
Of course, I speak only for myself, and I
write these views without opportunity to con
sult with my fellow commissioners. In my
Judgment the concession referred to was ef
fectual in bringing about an acceptance of our
proposals, which resulted in the making of the
treaty. ' ~- â â¢ *.-:.=
SENSATION SPRUNG
IN THE MILLS CASE
Deceased Left a Note in Which
He Stated That He Had
Eo Children.
REDWOOD CITY, Oct. 11.â The defense
sprung a sensation in the contest over the
estate of Robert Mills to-day. Mrs. Mi
randa E. Mills, wife of deceased, was the
most important witness examined. She
introduced a memorandum book kept by
her husband In which was written the
following statement:
"January 9, 1897.â Knowing that death Is
certain and often sudden, I write this
statement. I never had but one wife,
Miranda E. Mills, and I further state I
have no children. I leave no will. I wish
the distribution of my estate to be ac
cording to the laws of the State.
"ROBERT MILLS."
A similar statement was found in an
other book. The handwriting in both
cases had previously been passed upon by
Daniel T. Ames, the expert, and pro
nounced that of Robert Mills. At the
hour of adjourning Mrs. Mills was still on
the stand undergoing cross-examination.
WRIGHT WAS FOXY.
Cleverly Evadea" Deputy Sheriff
Lucas and His Writ.
LARKSPUR, Oct. Deputy Sheriff
John Lucas girded up his loins yesterday
and did the David and Goliah act, with
President C. W. Wright of the local water
company as his opponent, but Lucas got
badly fooled and the writ of mandate is
sued by Superior Judge Angellottl order
ing the company to supply water to Mrs.
Kate G. Record has not yet been served.
i Wright adopted a fin de Steele method to
avoid service of the writ that would have
| made Goliah ashamed of himself. He hid
! behind a water tank near the railroad,
and when Lucas got off the early train
from San Rafael with the intention of
either finding Wright or keeping him
penned in his house all day the astute
official slipped aboard the train and went
to San Francisco. The hour of his return
no man knoweth.
Attorney Mahony came to the rescue
and cut the Gordian knot in a manner
more forcible than legal perhaps. Ma
hony's flowers were suffering while water
in plenty was near, and he wouldn't
"stand for it." He simply opened his
meter box, turned on the water and then
nailed the cover down so tightly that a
crowbar would hardly have sufficed to
open It again. Water now flows in plenty
over the Mahony garden, but the writ still
ornaments Lucas' pocket.

SAUSALITO, Oct, 11.-The friends of

ploit in striking a young lady recently
brought him into prominence, while mak
ing no excuse for his action on one score,
assert that he has been done an injustice.
It is stated in behalf of Noble that^he
lost his head on. account of the girl in
question following him all around the
steamer San Rafael; and insulting him
in the presence of a number of auditors,
even going to the length of expectorating
in his face. On leaving the boat the girl
slapped him, when his anger caused. him

Almost everybody who reads the

i Swamp-Root, the great kidney remedy.
It is the great medical' triumph of the
I nineteenth century; discovered after
; years of scientific research by Dr. Kil-
mer, the eminent kidney and bladder
: specialist, and is wonderfully success-
i ful in promptly curing kidney, liver,
bladder and uric acid troubles.
Swamp-Root has been tested in so
many ways, in hospital work, in pri-
vate practice, among the helpless too
{ poor to purchase relief, and has proved
so successful in every case that a spe-
cial arrangement has been made by
which all readers of the San Francisco
Call who have not already tried it may
have a sample bottle sent free by mail;
also a book telling more about Swamp-
Root and how to find out if you have
kidney or bladder trouble. When writ-

J. STERLING MORTON.
Julius Sterling Morton was secretary or Agriculture under the second
C\^\ [ministration- He moved from New York to Nebraska In the
middle fifties ac 1 beiran to farm. He was the originator of the annual
arbor day, Dow ohserved in Western prairie States. In In5S he was elected
Sreiftry at State. and. soon. af;er was Acting Governor of the Territory of
Nebraska. Later he became a member of the Legislature. He has been"
president <>f a number of farmers' associations and societies. He ha-* al
ways taken a rr-'mlient part in State politics and has cut a prominent fig-
urrÂ» in the â¢â  mi [Is â¢â :' the Democratic party in the Middle West. He is cow
tried ' the gold standard wing- of the Democracy. His home is in
NEBRASKA CITY. Neb., Oct. 11. âIn iPSo William Jennings
Br.â.n became a candidate for the position of secretary of the Rail
way Comm-ssion in Nebraska. The salary attached to that offi:e
was about Siooo per annum. Many of the political and personal
friends of Bryan were active and persistent in pushing the late
Presidential candidate, then in pin feathers, for the place. Among those
endeavoring to help Bryan was J. Sterling Morton, whose periodical, the
Conservative, will to-morrow reproduce in fac-simile a letter of Mr. Bryan
in which he aver? that he seeks that office for the money that is in it and
net for honor. The Conservative publishes this electrotyped epistle be
cause Colonel Bryan, whom the Conservative quoted literally, even to his
bad grammar, positively denied having ever said that he wanted any office
for the money that was in it. Thus Colonel Bryan, who considers himself
invincible in pence, if by resignation he does become vincible in war, made
an issue of veracity with the Conservative and Mr. Morton.
The question how is: Did Bryan tell the truth when he denied Mor
ton's declaration, or did he tell the truth when he wrote Morton the letter
in which he "ays:
"I ASSURE YOU THAT IT IS THE MONEY THA.T IS IN" THE
OFFICE AND NOT THE HONOR THAT ATTRACT ME"?
Besides publishing the sworn statement of Henry G. Smith as to what
Colonel Bryan said in denying the allegation and quotation ot the Con
servative, that journal contains the following telegram. This telegram is
one reason, with other details and denunciations, for publication of the
startling letter:
LINCOLN. Neb.. Sept. 26, iSoo.
THE CONSERVATIVE. NEBRASKA CITY. NEB.:
In an interview to-day \V. J. Bryan flatly denied that he had
ever said or intimated in any way that he desired omce for the
money there was in it. He said that anything J. Sterling Mor
ton might say in that connection was false.
F. A. HARRISON.
The Conservative illustrates the position of Colonel Bryan now when
he is confronted by his own letter and also the amazement of his follow
ers, when they see and read it. thus:
"It was at a baptizing in the rural district. The colored parson was
carefully feeling his way to firm rock bottom. He was in waist deep, when
suddenly he keeled over, floundered, sputtered, and then disappeared under
the water. But in a moment his horrified congregation on terra firma. saw
him hob up serenely and make desperately for shore. They dragged
him, dripping, up the bank, when he muttered in a weak voice, 'Fo' God, I
neve- knowed dey wuz alligators in dat millponV "
The African anecdote rom the Atlanta Constitution may be read for
consolation by some of the epithet^ among the editorial and ora
torical friends of Colonel Bryan after they have perused his fac-simile let
ter in the Conservative to-day. Before plunging with athletic fervor into
the deep denial of the utterances of_the Conservative as to what Colonel
Bryan had said when first asking office in his "Beginning here" for "the
money in it rather than the honor." these zealots did not know "the alli
gator" was laying for them "in dat millpon.' "
The Conservative further remarks under the head cf "Tin Soldiers":
"There are a number of colonels in Nebraska whose warless records, gun
less valor and battieless renown make them almost equal in military
achievement to Colonel William Tennings Bryan himself."
The colonels to whom the Conservative alludes have declared the
Conservative I liar because it had literally quoted a3 published an extract
from the pen of Colonel Bryan saying, without regard to grammar, "I
assure yon that it is the money that is in the office and not the honor that
attract me."
The Conservative also quotes the following from Bryan's letter accept
ing the ' Presidential nomination and compares it with the assertion in the
letter to J. Sterling Morton: "The people of this nation sitting in a high
court must render judgment in the cause which greed is prosecuting."

Change of Visiting Day at Mark
Hopkins Institute Owing to
the Sabbath Not Proving
Popular.
At a recent meeting of the board of di
rectors of the San Francisco Art Asso
ciation it was decided to m.ike Friday the
day upon which the public will be ad
mitted to the Mark Hopkins Institute of
Art free of charge instead of Sunday,
as heretofore. When Mr. Searles deeded
the institute to the regents of the uni
versity for the use of the art associa
tion it was his wish that one day In each
month should be free to the public, leav
ing It to the board of directors to de
termine the day. Friday, was chosen and
maintained for several years, but at the
suggestion of a prominent local organiza
tion some nine months ago It was changed
to Sunday with the idea that more peo
pie would be able to avail themselves of j
the privilege on that day. As a matter
of fact, however, the number of visitors
has never averaged as great during the
day, while in the evening It has decreased
to a point scarcely warranting the ex
pense of lighting and attendance.
Arrangements rave been made by the
board of directors of the art association
for having the pupils of the sculpture
class In the school of design instructed
in the methods of making casts. It is
the intention to give students of model
ing an insight into the practical part of
the business of the sculptor. A compe
tent instructor will be employed under
the superintendence of Professor Douglas

ment in the school.

WILLIAM JENNINGS BRYAN.
COLONEL BRYAN Is the most conspicuous example in our history of
a man with no occupation but politics, with no estate nor invest
ments nor business except politics, making a living and perhaps a
fortune by being a standing candidate for the Presidency. He was
liberally educated, and had a thorough training for the bar. He prac
ticed law briefly in Jacksonville. 111., near the scene of his nativity and
his education, and there was involved In certain complications incident to
the practices rather than the practice of his profession, and soon withdrew,
retired and disappeared from that part of the country.
After an interregnum he appears in Lincoln, Nebr., as a member of a
law firm. In a field In which young men had succeeded and were suc
ceeding, in that profession, he made no progress. Poppleton. Manderson,
Meiklejohn, Lambertson and J. Sterling Morton had risen from the ranks,
as young attorneys, to first place in the law. McHugh. a man of Bryan's
age and contemporary with him in Nebraska, had read for his profession on
a "shoemaker's bench, and by sheer capacity and force of character took rank
bo high that Mr. Cleveland transferred him to the judicial bench as Fed
eral strict Judge. Others, all over Nebraska â at Lincoln, Hastings, Grand
Island "in the grow cities in the valley of the Blue River on the south
and In the valley of the Elkhorn on the north: at Columbus, North Platte,
Kearney and wherever the developed energies of that great State found
expression in a center of population, contemporary with Mr. Bryan, were
reaching prominence and fortune in the profession for which he was trained.
While ynuns men of his age, either immigrants or natives, were succeed
ing in Nebraska, as a generation before them had succeeded, the State was
sending out men produced on her soil to conquest fortune and win fame
rjeyoncfhfr borders. Conspicuous among these was Fred Lehman, now a
leader of the St. Louis bar, an orphan. left forlorn, raised as a cowboy and
Â«heepherder. whose horizon of promise was so narrow that his hands could
touch it. Tet he acquired for himself a fine academic training and a prep
aration for the bar which have made him one of its most honorable and
able members.
Immersed in this busy scene of Intellectual toll and mental activity Mr.
Bryan caught no inspiration from his surroundings. He had no push and
made no progress in his profession. To bench and jury he was a declaimer
merely, and lacked in that logical faculty of mind which, being the basis
of the power of statement, is the foundation of success. The things around
him made upon his mind precisely the impression that the text of a drama
makes uDon the mind of an actor. He trained his faculty of speech unem
barrassed by thought or ideas. He was in demand at church fairs to pre.
sent the ring cake that had been voted to the most beautiful young lady,
for the enrichment of the parish treasury. He welcomed the delegates of
the Fire Department to annual meetings and hailed oratorlcally the stated
assembly of the Grand Army. He and the brass band became inseparable
companions on those public occasions when busy people dropped their labor
for a day and sought social recreation.
The only red letter day in the calendar on which his voice was impossi
ble was circus day. The circus is an Institution so well established that
public opinion permits no rival, and when its spangled pleasures spread
under canvas Mr. Bryan had to see a crowd to which he could offer noth
ing, and it is remembered that on such days he seemed to be suffering the
agonies of undelivered speech.
In this condition of intellectual vagrancy, unfitted for the law and un
successful In Its practice through Incapacity to grasp its principles, with
no handicraft and giftless except a thespian memory and manner, he went
into politics as a profession. During his candidacy in IS9S it became pub
lic knowledge that his special train would not stop at a town until a sum
of money was guaranteed. He had become a show, and people were willing
to pay for him as a show, and his thespian instinct saw the opportunity to
gain pelf by taking advantage of the situation.
At last he was in a position where no circus could rival or shut him
up, and even the brass band had to pipe meekly in the presence of a greater
attraction.
When the fight of 159*5 was over there was no law practice to return to.
no calling, vocation nor bread-winning labor to which head or hand could
turn. He was the only public man who had reached prominence in all our
history who was absolutely without a calling or occupation by which to
support himself. So he took to the road again, gathering gate money as
he went. Public curiosity to see and hear him had not abated. He was
still the "boy orator" and "juvenile wonder." . ...; : :
In the three years since he ran for President he has addressed Chau
tauqua assemblies. State fairs, county fairs, conventions, meetings of all
kinds and for all purposes, and has done nothing else. He has taken no
fees as a lawyer, no salary as a journalist, no dividend as an investor, no
wages as a laborer. He is not classified and identified with any of the pro
ductive industries or gainful professions of the country.
Looking s)pon the singularly undignified spectacle presented by a Presi
dential candidate who lives on politics some months ago his fellow' v'ebras
kan. Hon. J. Sterling Morton of Nebraska City. ex-S> retary of Agricul
ture, a publicist of high standing and editor of the Conservative, a journal
of the highest thoughtful rank, declared that Bryan began his political ca
reer for the purpose of making a livelihood; that he never had any inten
tion of practicing a profession or sticking to any legitimate business, and
expected to make a living and perhaps a fortune out of politics. In fine,
the accusation was that he sought office for the money in it, and not for
the honor nor the opportunity of useful service, and used the notoriety of
having been a Presidential candidate as a means of making money.
This Bryan denied, declaring that he had never sought office for the
money in it. A reporter interviewed him and gave the result under oath
as we present it to-day. It Is evident from Bryan's anxiety to avoid pub
lication of his denial to the reporter that he flinched. He f^lt that in deal
ing with Mr. Morton he was in the hands of a man who never was known
to utter praise or blame that he could not substantiate with proof and rea
son. it-Jr';'-;/; :.ffi*Â£S ; I '.'TIK-fS-i :\ '-'â ? :'MPP:\
His instincts were correct, for Immediately Morton produces the letter

MILL VALLEY. Oct. 11. -While fighting
the flames which were raging fiercely on
the summit of Corte Madera ridge last
night and threatening to sweep down
Baltimore Canyon and destroy the towns
of Corte Madera and Larkspur. Thomas
Kerrigan of San Rafael had one of the
narrowest escapes from an awful death
that ever fell to the lot of man. Kerri
gan was burned so severely about the feet
that he had to be taken -to his heme at
San Rafael and riacei under the care of
a physician. 'That he was not roa-ste-i
alive is solely due to his own personal
bravery, coolness and experience :n lire
'"Kerrigan, who has filled the position of
guard both at Fcisora and San Quenttaj
was on* of the twenty men sent from san
Rafael by Station Agent Doody totflght
th.- flame's when it was seen that Lark
spur and the famous Baltimore- Canyon j
were endangered. He was working alone
in the work of backfiring on the summit
of the ridge; his nearest companions be
ing 100 feet away, when a gust 01 wind
carried a sheet of flame about 5*3 feet in
b-ss than ten seconds. In a trice the trees
and brush were blazing fiercely a.! around
Kerrigan' Â»nd his escape looked hopeless.
Without losing any time he stuffed ins
handkerchief into his mouth to avoid in
haling the flames, and made a dash tor
life through the raging element. He had
cleared half the space with no injury
other than singeing his hair, eyebrows
and mustache, when his foot struck a
stone that rolled under him and threw
him headlong. Not waiting to regain his
feet for frar he would be suffocated. Ker
rigan ro!L*d over and over until he found
himself out of the tire 100 feet below. . His
I shoes were nearly burned off his feet and
his feet and legs badly cooked. While
the Injuries thus received, and the sore
ness resulting from jolting over busnes
and rocks will confine him to his bed for
a few days, the injured man is sanguine
that he wlil soon "be "as good as new."
Kerrigan relinquished his position at San
Quentin to serve as a volunteer in Com
pany D, and was recently mustered out
of service.
The fire was completely extinguished by
the torrent of rain which fell last night
for an hour and a half, and to-day the
atmosphere is clear, with a light wind
blowing. A conservative estimate places
the damage done by the fire at not more
than no.ooo, as it is claimed that the red
wood timber, which was supposed to have
been totally destroyed, will be freshand
green again next year, the bark being
too thick md moist to permit of permanent
injury by the fire. Contrary to the re
port published in two morning . papers
that a trestle of the Scenic Railway had
been burned. Manager Louis L. Janes as
serts that hardly any damage was done
to the road, and in proof of his assertion
points to the fact that this morning
trains ran up and down the mountain as
usual. The company was crowded to the
utmost in finding sufficient rolling stock
to accommodate the crowds that came
over from San Francisco to view the
havoc wrought by the fire, and many had
to wait in tewn until the afternoon trains
passed over the road.
Considerable damage was done personal
effects, furniture and other portable.' arti
cles by the rain, as the county road near
Alto station and Ccrte Madera' was lit
tered with household goods . for three
miles. Every one of these who removed
their effects in order to avoid their de
struction by the flames was at work to
day replacing them in the vacated cot
tages, and express men have had a "good
thing." All the cattle driven off the va
rious ranches were herded together and
driven back this morning.
The cost of procuring fire fighters will
aggregate $1200. The most of this expense
wiU be borne by the North Pacific Coast
Railway Company and the remainder by
individual property owners,
SAX JOSE. Oct. 11. -It is believed that
last night's rain, which was heavy in the
Santa Cruz Mountains, has put a* stop to
the forest firr-s which have been prevailing
to such an alarming extent. While only
indefinite reports have been received from
the mountains this morning, all tell of
heavy rain and the quenching of the fire.
Reports which were s*nt out Monday
night from f^nta Cruz saying that Hub
hard & Carmichael's mill had been
burned are, fortunately, erroneous. The
firm has headquarters here, and state
that hard work stopped the fire short of
their property, so they suffered no loss
Their reports this morning indicate that
the rain put out the fire. Xumerous resi
dences and barns have b*en burned and
orchards and vineyards swept by
the fire. The rain comes as a great boon
for the alarmed people, many of whom
have lost their all and have been forced
to flee for their lives.
The latest estimates low that about
twenty houses were destroyed, and during
the high gale some cattle were caught and
suffocated by fire and smoke. It is prob
ably a conservative estimate to place the
loss at $200,000; with small insurance. This
does not cover the loss of timber, for no
one knows yet what this may be. As a
rule, it is believed that the fire" was fought
back from the redwood forest.
Before the rain came up last night a
terrible- fire was raging along Bear Creek
and near Loma Prieta. Reports this
morning tell of heavy rains last night at
both points. A message from Wrights
rays all the fire is out in Austin Gulch
find that there is little left at Loma
3'rieta. The largest scope of eountrv ever
swept over since this section was settled
is now black and desolate as a result of
the fire. Xo man can estimate what the

DEEPENING THE
ALVISO SLOUGH
Full Appropriation May
Be Expended.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAX JOSE, Oct, 11.â The business men
of San Jose and Santa Clara County are
deeply interested in the dredging and im
provements to be made by the Govern
ment at Alviso Slough and have appointed
a committee to watch the work and se
cure all possible good that can be had
out of the $18,000 appropriation made by
Congress for the work. The contract for
the improvement has been awarded to J
T. McCann for $12,600. This will leave
over $30,000 of the appropriation unused,
and an effort will be made to have the
Secretary of War. who has charge of the
matter, expend the balance in the work.
When the McCann contract is completed
there will be seven feet of water at the
lowest tide in Alviso Slough, and if the
other S3'i,OjO were expended the harbor
would be an excellent one and could ac
commodate the largest coastwise vessels.
At a meeting of prominent citizens at

Day Taken Up With Arguments on
Both Sides.
SUISTJN, Oct. 11.â Attorney John A.
Hosmer opened the argument for the
prosecution in the McKenzie case this
morning. He first explained his connec
tion with the case and touched on the
matter of personal feeling intimated by
the defense against District Attorney
Bell. Hosmer then began a minute dis
cussion of the evidence with an admo
nition to the jury to be extremely mindful
of tails.
He was followed by Attorney George
A. Lamont for the defense. Lamont se
verely criticized District Attorney Bell.
He contended that the prosecution bad
failed to establish the guilt of the de
fendant, and that Walters had shot Cook
.in self-defense. Lamont will conclude his
address to-morrow morning, and will be
followed by Grove L. Johnson, after
which District Attorney Bell will close
the argument for the prosecution. The
case will probably be submitted to the
jury to-morrow afternoon.

by the Recent Conflict
With Spain.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
EVANSYILLE. tad., Oct. 11.â President
MeKinley and his Cabinet came from
Chicago this morning to attend the na
tional reunion of the Blue and the Gray.
A heavy rain was falling, but. despite
this, 10,000 veterans and visitors thronged
about the railroad station, and the vet
erans in gray vied with the veterans in
blue in tendering a tremendous ovation
when the Presidential party arrived. The
party was at once escorted to the fair
grounds.
Mayor William M. Akin sided, and
C. A. de Bruler of Evansvilie welcomed
the distinguished guests nd veterans to
the city. Governor J. A. Mount followed
with an address of welcome on behalf of
the State and introduced President Me-
Kinley. The President said:
ify Fellow Citizens: It gives me very great
pleasure to participate with -you, men of the
North and men of the South, in this glad re
union of hearts. We are already unified. The
peace which Grant and Lee made at Appomat
tox has been kept by law and restraint, and,
we believe, fraternal regard. The talon to
day rests not en force which may fail, but
rests in the hearts of the peopleâ that Union
can never be severed.
I' I have been permitted in the slightest de
gree to help in the work of reconciliation and
unification. I will tsteem it the greatest honor
of my life. When I made the call for troops
to prosecute the Spanish war men of the
North and the South, without regard to polit
ical belief or religious creed, rallied to the
standard of the Union. The best of the South
came â the son 3of old Confederate soldiers. The
best men of the North came â the sons of the
old members of the Grand Army of the Re
public. All came together in -heart and hand
to follow the flag of their country wherever,
it might lead. We have been reconciledâ more
than reconciledâ for our reconciliation has been
baptized in the best blood of both sections of
our beloved country. If a Northern soldier put
the flag up at Santiago, a Sosthern soldier, the
gallant Brumby of Georgia, put it up over
Manila. It rests with us to look to the future.
putting the past behind. And this Government
relies upon the patriotism of the country.
North and South, to stand by the purposes of
the Government and follow in the pathway of
its destiny.
We come together not as we came a third of
a century ago, it), arms in our hands, but
we come with love for each other in our hearts.
Attorney-General Grigs-?, Secretary-
Gage and Secretary Long also spoke
briefly. The Presidential party departed
at noon for the north.
At Vincennes the President was greeted
by another crowd. He spoke as follows:
I thank you for this most warm and generous
welcome. We ought to be a very happy peo
ple. We are a very happy people. The bless
ings which have been showered upon us have
been almost boundless, and no nation In the
world has more to be thankful for than ours.
We have been blessed with good crops and
fair prices. Wages and employment have wait
ed upon labor and. differing from what it was
a few rears ago, labor is not ting on the
outside for wages. Our financial condition was
never better than now. We have' good money
and plenty of it circulating as our medium of
exchange. Banks may fail, fluctuation in'
prices come and go. but the money of the
country remains always good, and when you
have a dollar of It you knew that dollar is
worth one hundred cents, because back of it
is the Government of the United States.
Not only have we prosperity, but we have
tismâ and what more do we want? We
are at peace with all nations of the world and
were never on better terms and closer rela
tions with each and every one of them than
we are to-day. We have a little trouble in the
Philippines, but the gallantry of the brave
boys who have gone there will. I trust, soon
put down that rebellion against the sover
eignty of the United States.
CHICAGO Oct, 11.â The special train
bearing the Presidential party arrived in
Chicago this evening from Evansvilie,
lnd., and was at once started on the jour
ney north. St. Paul will be reached at
9 o'clock to-morrow morning. The day
and evening will be spent at Minneapolis
and St. Paul, and at midnight the de
parture will be made for Duluth.
The weather has continued wet and
gloomy throughout the day. The rain
detracted in some degree from the enjoy
ment of the exercises of the Blue and
Gray reunion at Evansvilie, in which the
President and the members of the Cabinet
participated, but nothing could altogether
dampen the ardor of the throng which
had gathered to greet the chief magis
trate. At every station between Evans
ville and Chicago the crowds were large
and enthusiastic, and at most of them
the President made brief remarks.
Among the first to greet the President at
Terre Haute was the venerable Richard
W. Thompson. Secretary of the Navy in
the Cabinet of President Hayes, and now
nearly M years of age. At Terre Haute
President McKinley made a brief talk,
referring particularly to the improved
conditions of the workingmen whom he
saw everywhere about him. Secretaries
Long. Gage. Hitchcock and Wilson and
Attorney General Griggs also .spoke at
Tern Haute, and in all of the speeches
there was much of a partisan nature.
At Danville, 111., the President was in
troduced to an enthusiastic crowd by
Congressman Joseph G. Cannon. In the
course of a speech there the President
said:
We are collecting Just now $1,000,000 for every
working day of the month on our internal reve
nue taxes and you don't seem to l*- very much
oppressed here on that account. We are col
lecting about $650,000 every working day of
every month from the tariff that we put on
foreign products that come into the United
State* from other countries and that does not

(Laughter.) That vast, amount of money re
ceived Into 'he treasury daily from internal
taxes and customs tariffs meets the ordinary
expenses of the Government, and Just now a
part of it is used to pay the soldiers and sailors
who are engaged in the distant Islands sup

PORTION OF BUTTE IS
SLIDING DOWN HILL
Large Buildings Are Cracked From Top
to Bottom and Mining Experts
Have Been Summoned.
BUTTE, Mont. Oct. 11.â A big portion of the city of Butte, which is built on
the side of a hill, is sliding down grade. Evidence of it has become apparent
during the past week and has alarmed the residents west of the central part
of the city. A little over a week ago the first evidence of a general slide
down hill was noticeable when the heavy inside brick walls of the county
courthouse fissured from the top to the bottom. The cracks have been grow
ing larger since. At the same time the handsome residence of United States
Senator W. A. Clark, a few blocks west of the courthouse, began to crack in
the middle from the roof to the ground and clear through from the east to
the west side, the crack at the foundation being over an inch wide.
The splendid edifice of the First Presbyterian Church and numerous resi
dences south and west of the courthouse have suffered similarly by the
southerly slide. Mining experts and geologists have been called to examine
the phenomenon and give it as their opinion that it is due to a cleavage In the
earth and that the buildings damaged are located exactly on the line of
separation.

not a dollar of it will go out except for honeEt
purposes while your distinguished representa
tive presides over the Committee of Appro

At Hopston, 111., President McKinley
said:
We have seen a great man people to-day;
we have been greeted by many, many thou
sands of our fellow citizens. From the appear
ance and cheerfulness of the people it has
seemed to me that all things must be going
fair.v well with you: that you have employ
ment at fair wages; that you have good crops
at fair prices, and that your great industry
here that of canning, is in e-very respect most
satisfactory and successful. I congratulate
you that you are now using American tin. for
that is now one of the great enterprises of the
country. (Great" applause.)
Referring here to the hostilities in the
Philippines the President said:
In our recent war with Spain not only your
State, but every State of the Union. North and
South, rushed forward by the hundreds of
thousands to serve their country, and they will
not abate their patriotism until every rebellion
everywhere and by whomsoever conducted shall
be put down. I? that what you want, men of
Illinois? (General cry of "Tea.") . That Is
what is being done and what will be done.
The last speech of the day was made at
Watseka. 111., where the President ad
dressed a large assemblage. Chicago was
reached at 9 p. m.

WRIGHT SUES
FOR A DIVORCE
Scandal in San Jose
Society Circies.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAX JOSE, Oct. 11.â For the past few
weeks society gossips have been whisper
ing of trouble in the domestic life of
Attorney C. D. Wright and his wife. It
has now leaked out that a divorce suit
was filed September 18, but the matter
has been closely guarded. The Wrights
have always moved in the upper ten of
society, and Mrs. C. D. Wright was. al
ways a leader in social affairs.
The complaint in the divorce proceed
ings Charges Mrs. Wright with being un
faithful to her husband, and several in
stances of this alleged infelicity are cited.
L. J. Ordway, a banjo player, who came
here several years ago from Honolulu, is
named a,s co-respondent.
Professor Ordway built up large music
classes here and socletv lionized him. He
boarded with the Wrights, and Mrs.
Wright was in his. company a great deal.
It is said that Wright finally ordered
Ordway from his home. A %-ear ago he
returned to Honolulu.
A brother of the musician, George H.
Ordway, made several trips here and be
came acquainted with Virginia McAran,
daughter of Mrs. Wright by her first hus
band. An engagement followed and last
May Miss McAran. accompanied by her
mother, went to Honolulu, where" Miss
McAran and Ordway were married. Mrs,
Wright remained in the islands until
about a month ago. Wright became sus
picious of his wife and had her watched
In Honolulu, with tne result that he ob
tained sufficient evidence of her and U.
J. Ord way's actions to warrant a suit for
divorce.
When Mrs. Wright returned her hus
band refused to have anything to do with
her. It is said she is now in San Fran
cisco, where she has secured attomevs
and will fight the divorce.
Mrs. Wright is a member of the old
Murphy family and was Moliie Murphy,
daughter of John M. Murphy. She mar

TO J. STERLING MORTON
Continued from Third Page.
of a livelihood. Morton had supposed his aspirations to be legitimate and
had befriended them.
In response to this encouragement Bryan wrote this remarkable letter,
in which he assured Mr. Morton that he wanted office for the money, and
not for the honor that was in it.
. That letter is the prospectus of his subsequent career, the preface to his
history.
It makes luminous that part of his character which has been ambushed
behind professions of regard for public interests.
It fits exactly into the mercenary attitude he has held since his candi
dacy in 1896.
It explains that phase in his career that displayed him in this State
loudly declaiming against the Southern Pacific Railroad while riding on its
pass free on all its trains, to fairs and Chautauquas, where he took most of
the gate money.
The purpose of his office seeking, avowed in that letter, has strength
ened with the success attending Its execution. He began with the hope of
getting money out of an office; he has learned how to coin candidacy for
office into money and how to sell his presence at a price.
This is now his only gainful occupation, and with this revelation it ap
pears as the deliberate purpose formed ten years ago.

/AUSTIN, Texas, Oct. 11.â A dispatch
from Chihuahua, Mexico, says that Col
onel Antonio Ramos Cadena and Lieuten
ant Colonel Hauro Candano of the Mexi
can awny have arrived there: eÂ»n their way
to take command of reinforcements that
are now being sent against the Yaqui
Indians. The two officers will join the
Mexican troops near Potamtt They say
the "War Department has issued orders
for the Immediate commencement***! a
decisive campaign against th* Indians,
and from now on there will be: no tem
porizing with the stubborn rebels.
About two weeks ago Genera! Torres
notified the warring members of the tribe
that a full and unconditional pardon
would be granted to all who surrendered
and laid down their arms within ten days.
This pardon embraced a restoration to
each Indian of his pro rata of land granted
the members of the tribe two years ago.
Thre were less than one hundred re
sponses to this notice and those who sur
rendered are nearly all old men who could
not stand the hardships of the severe
campaign that is before the rebels. It is
reliably reported the Mexican troops have:
received instructions from General Torre.;
to take no prisoners, and that it is to b-i
a war of extermination.
President Diaz has instructed the Mex.
can Consul at San Francisco to investi

from there by boat into the Yaqui country
by way of the Yaqui River. It Is certain
the Indians have recently come into pos

It is known the guns were not purchased
in Mexico. It is hinted a large mining
company now operating in the Yaqui
country undisturbed, although the war
ring Indians are all around them, has
had something to do with supplying the
Indians with arms and other supplies and
that they came consigned to them as
mining machinery. The officers of this

Hebrides,
VICTORIA, B. C, Oct. 11.â According to advices received in letters
which have reached here from the New Hebrides, two men-of-warâ
one British and one Frenchâ actling in concert, have been suppressing
bands of brigands which have been robbing and looting the native villages,
and in many cases the stores of the traders In the Southern Pacific archi
pelago.
A landing party, composed of men from either vessel pursued the pi
rates from point to point until they made a last stand at the top of a small
tableland, whore they had thrown up earthworks and constructed a fort.
This stand was of brief duration, for after firing a few desultory shots they
took to the jungle. Their camp was burned.
At Segon a band of escaped convicts from the French prison at New
Caledonia; who. since they escaped in a stolen schooner five months ago,
had been robbing and raiding, were annihilated and their camp destroyed.
They were slain to a man by the men-of-warsmen. Their number was not
learned, but it is said to have been about twelve or fifteen.
At Lepers Island, where the Governor was killed some time ago, the
two ships fired upon and destroyed the native villages, nothing being left
after they steamed away but a few smoldering thatches.
On one island was a camp of "beachcombers*' and white sailors of dif
ferent nationalities, the refuse of the various ports in the Southern Seas.
These men had carried away a number of native women from one of the
island villages. In revenge the natives seized a number of missionaries,
seven in all. five Catholics and two Protestants. The majority of the mis
sionaries were easily captured, but one made a vigorous fight and shot one
â¢ f the natives. Preparations had been made for the killing and eating of
the missionaries when the warships opportunely arrived and rescued
them.

OUTLOOK FOR A BREEZE
NOT VERY ENCOURAGING
To-Day Columbia and Shamrock Will Meet
Once More in an Attempt to Settle the
Question of Superiority.
LIGHT WINDS PREVAIL.
NEW YORK. Oct. 12.â Reports
from Sandy Hook and the Highlands
received at 4 o'clock this morning
were that a very light westerly wind
was prevailing, with a tendency to
decrease in velocity, and unless a
material change occurs there will be
no yacht race to-day. The local
weather forecast and that from
Washington indicate that only light
winds will prevail in this vicinity
to-day.
NEW YORK, Oct. 11.â outlook
\ for a race between the Shamrock
\ and the Columbia to-morrow is
* not of the best. Even the hitherto
optimistic Weather Bureau will
not promise a breeze. The revised
agreement calls for a â  start every
week day from this time on. so that there
is a possibility of the fate of the cup be
ing decided this week.
Looking as fine as two fiddles tuned up
to concert pitch, the Columbia and the
Shamrock lay quietly at their moorings
all day. with their tenders close a: hand
and tugs standing by for a call. Durin?
the early morning hours the fog was even
thicker than on Tuesday, but when the
sun came up toward noon the fog cleared
away under the Influence of a light breeze
from the south-southwest.
The cover was taken off the Columbia's
mainsail just before noon and the sail was
given a thorough overhauling and drying.
The new club topsail was also looked
after, and the running gear inspected fore
and aft. Speaking of the new topsail made
for the Columbia since the last race and
set on Tuesday for the first time, Mr. Ise
lin said:
"Yes. it is a larger sail than any of the
others, and I am pleased with the way it
sets. Whether it is larger thai any of
the Shamrock's I am not preoared to say.
You who see the boats under sail from a
distance ought to be able to tell that, for
I have not seen the sails of either boat
from a distance."
The utmost confidence in the American
yacht prevails ....... Many of
them have wagered a month's wages on
her. and all agree that she cannot be
beaten.
Weather -â â -.- at the Horseshoe.
where the fleet of yachts and tenders are
lying, were nearly as depressing to-day
as yesterday. The morning brought a fog
like that of the day before, although le-s
dense, which lifted slowly as the day ad
vanced. Not a breath of air was stirring
and there was no sign of a breeze until
the early afternoon, which was the drear
iest part of the day. On board the de
fender and challenger a close watch was
kept through the mist f.->r vessels, but
aside from this and the ordinary routine
there was little for the crÂ°w to do except
wait for the morrow and hope for a wind.
As the dark advanced the fog lifted, until
at noon it was hardly more than a haze
on the horizon.
M'MANUS ADHERES TO
HIS FORMER STORY
PHILADELPHIA. Oct. 11.â To-day's
proceedings in the trial of Ellery P. Ing
ham and Harvey K. New respectively
former United States District Attorney
and Assistant, on the charge of con
spiracy and bribery in connection witn
the Lancaster revenue stamp counterfeit
ing case, was particularly interesting.
Secret Service Operative McManus. who
swore yesterday that Newitt had on 'wo
occasions given him $500 to protect the
counterfeiters, was under Attorney
Shields' cross-examination fire, during
which the defense was outlined. Mr.
Shields showed by cross-questioning that
he wanted Mr. McManus to admit that he
had led Mr. Newitt into a trap, but he
was not very successful.
William M. Jacobs, the proprietor of
the Lancaster cigar factory, and the self
confessed originator and leader of the
daring nd far-reaching counterfeit
plot, was examined by the Government-
He said that in ISSB. Downey, the Internal
Revenue Collector for Lancaster, told him
the secret service men were watching the
witness and Kendig In their counterfeit
ing operations. A few days later the
witness and Kendig visited Ingham In
Philadelphia, and after inquiring of him
if the secret service men could be cor
rupted was told by Ingham that he
thought that they could if properly ap
proached, and that most people could be
"reached" by money. Cross-examination
failed to shake Jacobs' testimony.
Samuel B. Downey, ex-deputy internal
revenue collector, confessed on the stand
to having accepted money from Jacobs
for supplying him with the information
that the secret service agents were watch-
Ing him. The court then adjourned until
to-morrow

NEW YORK. Oct. 11.â Those who go down the bay to-morrow morning
with Signor Marconi on the Grand Duchesse will have an assurance that It
will be their privilege to see a race between Columbia and Shamrock. The
race may not come off. but It will in time, and the passengers on the Grand
Duchesse will be given weather checksâ "good for a race."
Signor Marconi will be there for the purpose of sending bulletins and
reports to the Herald and The Call, by means of wireless telegraphy. If the
wind fails again little can be done, bat with a breeze sufficient to take the
yachts over the coarse within the time limit reports more complete than
any yet sent will be handled by Marconi. Those ashore will be able to follow
the yachts more closely than was ever possible before.
Captain Norton, who is in charge of the Grand Duchesse excursion, has
made every arrangement for the pleasure of his patrons. The steamship will
leave her pier Just above Desbrosses ferry slip at half-past 5 o'clock. Just as
soon as she swings out into the river Signor Marconi will exchange signals
with the receiving stations at Naveslnk Highlands and the cableship
Mackay-Bennett. From that time until the passengers are landed on return
the system will be in constant operation.
Those who have made trips on the Grand Duchesse have been so eager for
souvenirs of the first use of the wireless telegraphy that the receiving tape
has been seized and cut Into short sections almost as soon as signals have
been printed upon it. About two miles of this tape has been distributed
among the excursionists, and if the races continue that amount will be more
than doubled.
About 1 o'clock the first breeze of the i
day came up from the south, light and
hardly more than enough to make a ripple
on the water. In the afternoon it in- i
creased, although It was never more than j
enough to move the smallest boats. The |
sail covers on the big yachts, taken off
at midday, were replaced about midafter
noon. Columbia's men being the first to i
do this. No work on sails or rigging was i
done on the American boat. On the Sham- i
rock none had be^n attempted on other I
days.
C. Oliver Iselln said the new club top- :
sail and the mainsail were both satisfac- !
tory, so far as he could tell, and no more
changes had been made in either. He '
said, further, that practically no changes i
had been made on Columbia. He denied
that any trouble had been experienced
with the bobstay and said the work on
that had been merely painting.
"This one is not galvanized," he said,
"and we have to paint it frequently. That
Is the reason for the work of the sailors
on it."
In response to a question. Mr. Tselin
said Designer Herreshoff would sail on the
Columbia in all of the cup races, as he
had sailed orx the trials already held, and
would add his experience and knowledge
MAUD ADAMS A
WINE ARTISTE
A good many actresses call a cham
pagne scene an opportunity. They con
sider that there is a charm In the tipsy
role which will lend itself to them,
whereas the audience is made to realize
that there must be much charm in them
to lend any to the tipsiness.
All of which is not a temperance lec
ture but a plain statement apropos of
Edith Mason's Girofle at the Grand.
Maud Adams can tipple, and that right
daintily and elfishly; but Maud Adams is
a wonder. The average actress finds the
straight and narrow path of sobriety a
safe one.
The fact that Mis 3 Mason attempts to
much is probably not her fault. The
opera was written with the chief scene
of the name part built around a bottle,
and she was cast for the part. Perhaps
Â«he knew beforehand that she was riot
tripoing and tinkling enough to succeed.
At any rate, she has discreetly resisted
the temptation to overdo, though the
temptation stalks boastfully before her
even unto the fall of the curtain. A be
coming calcium upon the ' See How It
Sparkles" song comes to the aid of her
own neat voice and spares her flat failure.
But Girofle was not written for Edith
Mason. , '.
The opera for the rest is a smooth
enough little affair. It leaves no marked
impressions, either good or bad. The ap
plause is mild; there are no real hits.
Thomas Persse can always make love to
the satisfaction of all concerned and not
concerned, and the part of Marasquln
gives him an opportunity after his own
heart San Franciscans know V- llliam
Wolff's lovableness too well to be , thor
oughly terrified by his interpretation of
Mourzouk, but he is a good Mourzouk for
all that,' and Arthur Wooley's tremors at
the furniture smashing chief are trem
ulous enough. ,
But the memory of the piece is not long
enough to turn the Third-street corner.
enougn to SARAH COMSTOCK.
A NEW CAMILLE.
Under ordinary circumstances a woman
like Camille would not be able to gain
the sympathy of the refined person. For
it is not likely that a woman who out
raged the moral laws of society would
be shown any respect, and sympathy is
one of the greatest signs of respect in
existence. But there is an intermediator
which could even intercede for one os
tracized by society, and that intermedia
tor is pity. If an actress succeeds in
creating a pity for her Camille, without
resorting to affectation or other artificial
means, she has succeeded in espousing the
cause of the fallen, for pity Is invariably
followed by sympathy.
There are in the recollection of the
writer many artists who have triedâ
very hard indeedâ to Infuse into Dumas'
exceptional heroine the realism with
which the author was careful to sur
round her. But every one of them failed,
because in their anxiety to be natural
they became unnatural. First of all It
seems to be the ambition of most Ca
millas to look particularly consumptive
and worn during the first acts. This con
ception is wrong, because It is not nat
ural that a strong, handsome fellow like
Armand Duval would fall in love with
of the boat to that of Captain Barr.
At the New York Stock Exchange to-day
offers of 10 to S on the Columbia to:. no
takers. There was no money backing the
Shamrock in the hands of commission
brokers. Money at the New York Yacht
Club and other clubs has found no Sham
rock takers, and Columbia seems to be
the favorite yet with American bettors.
Betting has been even, 10 to â¢ and It) to 8
to-day in Columbia circles, but no money
is ready from the opposition, and no bet
ting of account has been done. One 5 to 4
bet in hundreds was recorded at the Hoff
man House, but all the other centers nave
no reports of wagers.
In an interview former Commodore
James D. Smith of the New York Yacht
Club said:
"There is little difference between the
boats, if there is any. and from what I
have seen of their sailing qualities thus
far I should prefer Shamrock. While I
may be a subject for cavil from my fel
low-members of the New York Yacht
Club. I yet think that I am entitled to my
opinions. For several series of races -
have been chairman of the New York
Yacht Club America's cup .committee. I
asked to be excused from further duty in
this matter."
and man a sickly girl, especially when
he knows that the girl does not lean an
ideal life. But we want a beautifut,
healthy looking Camille, who wanes dur
ing the last half of the play, but whose
appearance Is striking in the beginning.
If ever Nance O'Neill proved that she
was entitled to a prominent position
among the constellations in the dramatic
firmament it was in her impersonation of
the "new" Camille. Unaffected, graceful
and handsome she met all requirements
of a lovable woman. She never became
too vulgar in her moments of rage, nor
did she adapt too simpering a mood in
her moments of sorrow. In short it was
a characterization of which any artist has
reason to feel proud, a characterization
which reveals a great future for this
woman who is gradually nearing the pin
nacle of dramatic art. That she did not
look the part in the last act cannot be
put to her discredit as an artist.
The play is a new version translated
ably by Barton Hill. But the novelty is
only apparent in the costumes, which are
taken from the period of 1840. It is a play
well worth seeing. A. M.
Th.- feature of the amateur performance

Concert for the Red Cross.
The band of the First California Volun

benefit of the Red Cross and a certain
percentage of the proceeds will be set
apart to purchase the uniforms and In
struments, of which the band is so much
in need. The aggregation will be under
the leadership of A. Nelson Adams, The

Preparing for the Barbecue.
The special committee appointed by the

DEWEY'S WELCOME
AT MONTPELIER
Greeted by an Immense
Crowd.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
MONTPELIER. VL, Oct. Admrral '
Dewey arrived here from Shelbume on a
special train at 5:25 o'clock this evening
and was greeted by an immense crowd j
which had assembled at the- depot. The, |
admiral was met by his two brothers, Ed- !
ward and William. As .he walked
through the streets of the city just at
dusk in company with his brothers he
bowed right and left and waved his hands
to his old friends as he recognized them. '
To-night rain has been failing and has i
dampened the ardor of the people to a '
great extent.
Dewey has had one of the quietest days
since he left the Olympia. He enjoyed a
pleasant night's rest at the Shelburne
farm, took an early morning walk,
and then, after breakfast, in company
with others in his party, he was driven
for miles over the great estates of his |
host, Dr. W. Seward Webb. Early in
the afternoon the departure was taken
for Montpelier. where the admiral once j
more resumed his place in the public at- !
tention as guest of the capital city of the ;
State.
At Burlington Admiral Dewey was
greeted by a large concourse of school
children, who cheered and sang. At Wil
liston station Admiral Dewey, Mr. Calla
â  way and Dr. Webb went Into the engine,
the admiral's flag being transferred to
i that portion of the train. The party re
mained in the cab during a run of tnirty
miles. the admiral alighting a: Montpelier
Junction and (turning to his coach.
At stations along the line the admiral
was cheered. People came out of their
farmhouses and waved flags.
The train backed up from the junction
| into Montpelier so that the admiral was
' the first person to be seen on the train aa
I he sat in the vestibule gazing out on fa
j miliar scenes.
a great shout went up. and when the
train stopped the people pressed forward
to the car. There arose a cry of
"Speech! Speech"' but the admiral
shook his head, saying, "I can't talk."
and. turning to his brother Edward,
said. "You make a few remarks." The
admiral and his brothers walked across
the platform, ignoring the carriage in
waiting, and continued to the main
street, a short distance away.
The admiral walked to the home of
Edward Dewey, stopping to greet an
old schoolmate, who extended him a
welcome. Then the three brothers went
into Edward Dewey's house, the front
door being closed to the crowd which
surged from the street into the yard
right up to the steps.
BODY OF WARDEN AULL
IS LAID TO REST
In Accordance With the "Wishes of j
the Deceased, the Services Were
Very Simple.
SACRAMENTO, Oct. 11.â Late this aft
ernoon the casket containing the body of
Warden Charles Aull of Folsom prison
was laid away in the Creed Hay:
vault at the City Cemetery, but not until
it had been completely covered with beau
tiful flowers, tokens of the remembrance '
of friends in all parts of the State. The I
body reached this city on a train from !
Folsom bearing a delegation of Masons
and those who had been present at the
funeral services earlier in the day.
These services, in deference to the wish i
often expressed by the dead Warden, were |
of extremely simple character. Professor [
A. M. Etston of Berkeley, a minister of I
the Christian church, officiated, preaching I
a short sermon, in which he FDOk" of the j
qualities that had given Warden Aull the j
fame he enjoyed throughout the United
States as a penologist. P. C. Conn of
Natoma Lodge, Free and Accepted
Masons, of Folsom. of which lodge " the j
Warden had been a past master and past j
representative, performed the usual Ma
sonic service.
The body lay in the center of a room
overlooking the grounds of the prison
which had for twelve years claim- : the
best endeavors of Warden Aull. Complete
silence pervaded the penitentiary, the
prisoners having all been locked in their
cells. But the silence on their part was
not sullenness. for the truth is that the
prisoners appeared to have been deeply
touched by the death of the man they
had learned to respect as well as fear,
and expressions of sorrow were uttered
by many of the convicts. The floral pieces
banked in such profusion against the
cofSn came from prominent civilians and
State officials and they were of most
beautiful design.

THE RIGHT SPIRIT.
PRESIDENT JORDAN in introducing Presi
dent Wheeler of Berkeley to the students at
Stanford said the coming of such a man to the
presidency of the State University is one of the "most
fortunate things that ever happened to^ California,
and the tone and tne spirit of the address which
President Wheeler mace to the Stanford men will go
far to incline ail thoughtful Californians to agree with
the sentiment.
The dominant thought of the speech is the su
preme duty of loyalty to the university, to the State,
to the nation, to the work in which men of education
are engaged. Between Berkeley and Stanford there
is and ought to be rivalry, but there should never be
antagonism. The work done at the one institution
stimulates effort at the other and thus improves the
work there. Nor was it of the two great universi
ties only that he spoke in terms of loyalty and re
spect. It is gratifying to note the earnest commen
dation he gave to the smaller colleges in saying:
"Just as much as I believe in the differentiation in
athletics and studies, I believe in the differentiation
among colleges. When men from the small col
leges come to me for graduate work I find they are
quite as well prepared as those from the larger uni
versities to carry on any advanced work. So I dis
like to hear any one disparage the small or denomi
national colleges. Many men would not be inter
ested in colleges at all if it had not been for their
relation through the churches."
We cannot have in California too much of that
kind of speaking. The antagonisms, the prejudices
and the sectionalisms which prevail here have been
too long the chief theme of the greater part of our
oratory and our journalism. Rapid as has been the
advance of the State in every phase of civilization,
it would have been far more rapid had there been
a more potent spirit of co-operation among the peo
ple and a fulier comprehension that loyalty to the
larger interests of the State would not imply any
lack of fidelity to local interests.
The man who comes to us to teach not the for
malisms of the philosophy of the closet but the true
philosophy of active life, and who sets the example
of giving just praise and commendation wherever it
be due, who does not hesitate to ask Stanford men
to teach and to help Berkeley, and who, speaking
as president of Berkeley, avows his warm interest in
Stanford, is indeed a valuable addition. to : the citi
zenship of the State. California needs such men
and has long needed them, and it is to be accounted
a gain to the commonwealth that in this instance we
obtain such a teacher in a position from which he
can speak not only with eloquence but with the
prestige of authority.
The Hongkong Daily Press, not content with de
nouncing in set terms the manner in which the
United States transport Tartar was overcrowded with
troops, published â also a clever bit of satirical de
scription of what it termed the "United States trans
port Sardine Box," and argued that the officers who
sent it forth deserve a premium for their ability in
packing soldiers. The subject is not appropriate for
jesting, but inasmuch as the affair turned out all
right we can afford to smile at the joke. It is not
often v.c get one from Hongkong.
Mayor Phelan is of opinion there is room in
municipal campaigns for Democratic national poli
tics, but not enough for Republican national poli
tics. He would have the Democrats vote a straight
ticket and the Republicans scatter; and yet there
are folks who do not believe he thinks himself a very
astute young man.
While Kipling and Swinburne are doing the war
singing for the British against the Boers Poet
Laureate Austin is doubtless trying to find a rhyme
for Kruger and consoling himself with the thought
that while "the shallows murmur the deeps are
dumb."
London dispatches agree that the London press
ij defiant in its attitude on the South African mud
dle. It is safe to say, even in the absence of des
patches from the Transvaal, that the London press
is not on the firing line.
Now that the rains have put out the forest fires in
the Santa Cruz Mountains the grape men are com
plaining because it injured some of. their grapes.
There is no such thing as satisfying a man who lives
in the mountains.
THE ULTIMATUM OF THE TRANSVAAL
AFTER negotiations so prolonged as to lead to
\ the conclusion that neither side was willing
i V to precipitate a war, the Transvaal Govern
: ] ment has sent an ultimatum to the British which
i puts an end to further discussion. The argument
lis ended; the appeal is to the sword. The best news
I from South Africa will probably be of battle, and
I thus will begin Â£ conflict which will determine the
j destinies of the whole southern part of thai conti
j nent.
The determination of President Kruger to risk a
j W2r at once is not so rash as it appears on the race
lof things. It is true that in comparison with the
j British empire the Transvaal is but a weak country,
\ but it is stronger now than it will ever be again ua
j iess British aggression can be stopped at once. The
I Boers increase but slowly either in population or in
â¢ the arts of civilization. On the other hand, the Brit
ish in South. Africa are increasing rapidly. Even'
;' year sets their number augmented at a ratio tar sur-
I passing that of the Boers, and moreover they in
; crease in the wealth that adds to military strength,
; Their railways are extended, their factories multiply
! with each succeeding year. The Transvaal has noth
; ing to gain, but everything to lose by delay. If,
j therefore, they are to defend their independence at
! the cost of war it is but prudence for the:: to bgin
l the war at once.
From the present situation it appears that ***
Boers have waited until this time before declaring
[war simply that they might rally to their support
! their kinsmen of Orange Free State and all the
i Dutch elements of South Africa. It was doubtless
â¢ for no other purpose than that of gaining time to
accomplish such alliance that Kruger has been pro
nging the negotiations. Ke has now won bis
\ point. The Dutch of South Africa are about as
I united as they can become so long as British domin
j ion holds there, and it is clearly time for them to
j strike, and strike hard.
This is not the first time the British nd the Dutch
\ have me: in war to fight out a question of suprem
] acy. During the seventeenth century their commer
j cial rivalries brought them into conflict and they en-
I tered upon a war for the empire oLihe seas. Under
â¢ the leadership of Tromp and Ruyter on the side of
{the Dutch and Blake and Monk on the side of Eng
j land, the conflict was waged with relentless deter
j mination. Admiral Tromp raised a broom to the
I masthead of his flagship as a sign that he intended
to sweep the British from the ocean, and in many
ja hard-fought fight he came near to the fulfillment
jof his boast.
Now after the lapse of centuries the descendants
I of the Dutch settlers in South Africa have once more
i raised a broom as a sign of a determination to sweep
| the British out of their way. Whatever may have
1 been the beginning of the present conflict, it has now
! become a war for the dominion of all South Africa.
i It is to decide whether that country 'hall be under
i British or Dutch rule for all time to come. The issue ,
jis as well understood in London as at Pretoria. It \
j has been well known to the statesmen of both coun- j
j tries that the conflict is no vulgar fight for gold;
i mines or for rights of franchise, but for an empire cf ]
vast proportions of golden prospects.
While the odds are strongly on the side of the ]
Brit: the hope of the Boers and their allies of the
Free State are by no means desperate. They are at
home, while the British will have to send their
troops across long distances of sea and land. More
! over, the Boers have in the beginning of the war a
I decided superiority. A writer for the London Fort
nightly Review recently gave the comparative mili
; tary strength of the two races in South Africa, as i
I follows:
British. Dutch.
Cap* Colony 17.000 50,000
Oranze Free State 1,000 18,000
Transvaal 3.000 22,000
Natal 6,000 1,500
British Beehuanaiand 1.00 500
Rhorif'Sia 2,000 300
Imperial troops now in South
Africa 10,000
Totals 39,500 92,300
It is doubtless the hope of Kruger to drive the
British virtually out of the country at the first rush,
or at least to win such successes as to compel the
acknowledgment of the independence not only of
the Transvaal, but of Orange Free State. The own
ers of the rich gold mines will of course urge the
war party in Great Britain to the utmost, and the
natural pugnacity of the race will not require much
urging to continue the war. Even in the old days
England fought the United Colonies eight years be
fore conceding their independence, and she has not
lost anything of her old persistency. It is likely to
be a long war, and at the present time there is no
calculating what developments may come of it before
it closes.
SWINBURNE'S SONNET.
IT is evident that British opinion needs some tonic
to stomach aggression on the Transvaal. Her
bert Spencer and John Morley have voiced the
thoughtful disapproval of that element in British so
ciety which, after all, has given to the Victorian era
greater glory than all its soldiers and its sailors.
They stand there in the same moral and political at
titude as the American anti-imperialists and are
taunted as "little Englishmen." But still they stand
for morality and principle and justice, as against
blood-lust and greed. To overcome their influence
it has been found necessary to discover and invest
some reason identified with patriotism and the lib
erty and the rights of man, which are dear to the
British heart.
Two years ago, when state policy required mur
der and outrage to protect the Indian frontier, and
the independent tribes of the Chitral had to be the
victims, British opinion was soothed by calling the
tribesmen rebels and traitors, though they had never
been under any sort of subjection to British jurisdic
tion. When they had been killed, their poor huts
burned and their hill country laid waste, the English
conscience was quieted by the announcement that
the traitors of the Chitral had been punished.
But now the case is different. The Transvaal
affair cannot be dumped into the hopper as part of
the "white man's burden," and murder and criminal
aggression cannot be made to appear- as a duty to
the black or brown man. The Boers are civilized,
of an older race and better blood than the British.
Their ancestors were fighting for liberty at the bat
tle of the Golden Spur when the British Isles were
not out of the troglodyte stages of progress." *
They carried civilization into Africa in advance of
Great Britain and had planted civil and religious in
stitutions there while England was so intent on rob
bing the treasure vaults of Hindoo Princes and de
spoiling the Great Mogul that she hardly knew there
was such a continent as Africa.. Therefore these ter
rible Boers must be lied about in verse and prose,
misrepresented and abused. Kipling has done his
share, to his discredit, and his war song, which fits
the wolf murdering the lamb for roiling his water
by drinking, downstream exactly as it fits England
for making war on the Boers because they injure her

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, OCTOBER 12, 1599.
business by minding their own, has inspired Swin
burne to crawl out of his retirement and put his pen
to a libel in the form of a sonnet, in which he calls
i the Boers "wolves" and "dogs," who when they pray
1 have foul tongues that "blacken God's dishonored
name." Upon reading it one reaches the conclusion
that the British appetite must be rather rank to be
satisfied with such intellectual swill. It is, written for
the jingoes, and as they seek a virtuous excuse for
every vice to which Government can turn it will
satisfy them while it revolts the conscience of Eng
land and the world. It is putting poetry to a bad
use when it lilts against the weak and righteous and
exalts the strong and unrighteous.
No country can long afford to go forward in a
course of oppression and injustice against the con
science of its people. Our Government and that of
Great Britain seem bent on doing this now, but soon
all the Swinburnes and the Kipiings trilling together
will not hide Â«the clamor for national morality and
justice that will be heard on both sides of the At

A PACIFIC COAST COMMISSIONER.
AMONG the objects which the newly formed
\ Traffic Association hopes to accomplish is
that of bringing about the appointment of a
member of the Interstate Commerce Commission to
represent the Pacific Coast. In some respects that
object is the most important it has yet announced.
The contest against the scheme of the St. Louis
association over freight rates is but a temporary
fight. The victory will be of but passing value to
either side, for the loser will be almost sure to re
new the struggle at the first opportunity, and all will
have to be done over again. If, however, we could
procure a representative of this coast upon the In
terstate Commission that would be a lasting gain of
great value in more ways than one.
It is well known that the Pacific Coast has not
been altogether fairly treated in governmental mat
ters. The unfairness has not been due to any an
tagonism to us or to our interests, but to the ignor
ance of Eastern people concerning the conditions of
this part of the Union and the inability of the aver
age official at Washington to understand that we
have interests which are not identical with those of
the East and which, therefore, deserve all the more
careful consideration.
Evidences of the wrong done us in that way
occur in all departments of governmental work.
The Commerce Commission is not alone to blame.
In the present tariff, for example, the clause which
permits the President to arrange reciprocity treaties
without further consent of the Senate puts in the
list of things on which he can grant concessions many
articles which are California products and not a
single staple article of Eastern production. So the
appropriation bills almost invariably show a far
greater consideration to small creeks in the East than
to rivers and harbors on this coast. It is so all
along the line.
We are ourselves much to blame in the matter be
cause we have never made strenuous and well di
rected efforts to protect ourselves or to have strong
representatives at the national capital. We have not
re-elected our Congressmen with anything like the
steadfastness that we should have done, and every
delegation has contained a considerable number of
new men inexperienced at Washington and conse
quently without influence there. The effort now
made to gain a representative on the Interstate Com
merce Commission may be something of a forlorn
hope, but it is worth trying, and it is to be hoped
the Traffic Association will find sufficient backing
to make that part of its fight earnest, persistent and
continuous until it is won.
ESTIMATES made by competent experts are to
the effect that the total revenues derived from
the orchards and vineyards of the State this
year will be in the neighborhood of $15,000,000,
being an increase over those of last year of upward
of $3,500,000. The estimate is based upon- a calcu
lation that the total output will be 1200 carloads of
peaches at $1200 per car; 4000 carloads of prunes at
$700 per car; 350 carloads of apricots, for which
$2000 would be a low average; 2500 carloads of rai
sins, averaging $1200 at least; pears, plums and nec
tarines and that sort of fruit, 150 carloads, averaging
$1500 per car; apples, perhaps 150 carloads, at $1500
per car.
A statement of that kind is gratifying. It shows
the increase going on in the fruit industry and the
vast magnitude which the output has already reached.
Still it is not wholly satisfactory. The great bulk
of our fruit, the finest in the world, is sent to market
either fresh, or dried, or packed in tins. Now, in
even the best of these forms the fruit amounts to
hardly more than raw material. In the meantime
there is a wide demand for the finer grades of jel
lies, marmalades, preserves and all the hundred kinds
of fruit conserves and confections. Moreover, our
Consuls tell us there is a large demand throughout
the Orient for fruits in glass, since neither dried nor
tinned fruits stand the climate. Why should we
ship nearly all our fruit as raw material when by
manufacturing it to its highest form at home we
could not only diversify our industry and give em
ployment to more labor but largely increase our
revenues? . ,
The Governor of Texas has called the capitalists
and the investors of the country to meet some two
thousand business men of Texas in a convention to
discuss the industrial development of that State. It
is the purpose of the Texans to show enterprising
business men of the North that raw material for
manufacturing can be had more cheaply in that State
than in any other part of the Union, and that the
facilities for shipping to all parts of the ' world are
excellent. â¢ Why should not. California direct atten
tion to the possibilities that lie before the men of
capital and energy who will work up all our fruit
into the forms in which it will command the best
prices in the best markets of the world? '. 'â¢"â¢;
According to the estimates there will be $15,000,000
worth of fruit sent out of the State this year, and it
is safe to say that a considerable percentage of -it
will be worked over again in the East or in Europe
and sold for three times what we get for it. It is
not improbable that some of it may actually come
back to us and be sold in our own groceries as
Scotch marmalade, London preserves or confections
from Paris. It is almost certain that much of it will
be packed in glass in England and sent around to
China and there sold under our very eyes for a big
ger profit than we make in selling it in sacks or in
tins. It is time for California to follow the example
of the Southern States. Let us make known to in
vestors the wealth of our raw material and the
greater wealth that awaits those who will manu
facture it into its most finished form. ~ --4.

Dear Sir: I recognize in the Home Study Circle which you have
established through The Call another valuable means for public ed-
ucation, that education which is required beyond and outside of
public schools and even of colleges. The adults, the masses, as
well as the children, continually need educating. The broad, com-
prehensive courses of study which you are thus offering should, and
1 believe will, attract many students. Very truly yours,

true that the Committee of One Hundred

At th* election last year, before the

DIRECTORS DID
NOT STAND FOR
CONLON`S BILLS
Demanded His Resig
nation Instead.
Althecgn they received no verbal cr
public eastfgatfen at the hands of their
confreres. School Directors Cordon and
Ged^e were last night deprived of all
authority in the Supplies and Braidings
and Gronnds committees, and hills
amounting to over JUI.C-CO contracted by
them without authorization were repudi
ated by the Finance Committee of the
Board of Education. In Cordons case the
committee went even further; it called
him into an executive session held imme
diately before the regular meeting was
begun and requested his resignation from
the chairmanship of the Suopiies Com
mittee. Condon, however, was* forewarned
and had determined to brazen it cut. The
committee's pointed request was refused.
The condemnation of Gedge and Cordon.
occurred during the executive session-
There was no- demonstration whatever in
open meeting, merely the submission of
tne motions and reports decided upon in
close conference. Chairman Hcdhrook
had charge of the manipulations and he
opened by moving to rescind a motion
made by him two meetings before order
ing paid aii July and August claims
against the department. He explained
that at that time there were claims out
standing of which the board had no offi
cial knowledge; and these the Finance
Committee wished time to investigate.
His motion was carried, and then he
moved the payment of another list which
he submitted, and which included also
legal claims for September.
Geilge got anxious, and wanted to know
if Ji*.ii was included in the list for Weber
& Co. HoFbrook replied that there was
not. but that he would provide for it.
With that understanding Gedge subsided
and the new list went through. It or
dered the payment of claims aggregating
about yg.Otai. but on its face did not indi
cate that all Â«Qt the bills contracted
by Coni.ir. and Gedge during their extrav
agant administration had been honored
by the board.
The truth of the matter was that the
CfiCtJ given Weber & Co. was all that that
nrrn got on claims stacking up nearly
jseuft. For the balance of their bill they
wiU either have to take back their goods
or bring suit. The Finance Committee
takes the stand that the goods were or
dered by Ccnlon and Gedge without the
authority of the board and are of a con
sequence Illegal. Weber Jt Co. disagree
with that opinion and refuse to move the
goods back to their storerooms. Besides
the Weber claims others of different firms
aggregating between SSTSKJ and Ih><Â» were
also repudiated â enough, in fact, to keep
the firm of GK<ise and Conlon explaining
to their friends, the contractors, for the
balance .... of ocice.
President Bergerot followed Ho!brook
with a resolution equally l- damaging to
tbe supplies committeemen as was the

KELLY ANXIOUS
TO GET EVEN
Angered at the City
Fathers.
Kelly and Crtmmius are -- In arms
against the Supervisors for their action
In turning the patrol wagons over to the
Police Department- For some time past
Chief" Lees has been anxious to get con
trol of the wagons, . it .: was not until
the recent meeting of the Supervisors
that he was able to do so.
As a pretense for taking possession of
the wagons Lees preferred charges
against a parrel wagon driver named
Hoitz. who refused to- do the bidding of
a. police officer. Holtr, in answer to the
charges, appeared at the meeting of the
Supervisors last Monday and was dis- 1
missed from the service. Captain Witt- j
man acted in the role of his accuser, and j
principally on his testimony Hoitz. who \
is considered one of the most expert |
drivers in the department, was told to
seek another job.
Wittman. after testifying to the alleged \
misdeeds of Kcltz. addressed the Super- |
visors en what he termed the necessity of j
turning the wagons over to the Police De- [
partment. He claimed that at times the
drivers were negligent, and could not be j'
found when wanted.
After listening to his statement the city \
fathers, by resolution, decided to dismiss
the present drivers, and authorised Cnief |
Lees to take charge of the wagons. A few j
minutes later another resolution 'was
passed empowering the Police Commis
sioners to appoint fourteen extra police
men to take the places of the dismissed
patrol wagon drivers.
As considerable patronage results from j
the patrol wagons. Kelly and Crimmius
were naturally "sore" when they learned
cf the action of the Supervisors, and they
determined to get even.
Knowing that they expected to appoint j
the men who were to drive the wagons, j
Kelly and Crirnmins decided to circum- i
vent them. Tuesday -_-â â â - visited j
police headquarters and had a long con- !
versation with Chief Lees relative to the |
new appointments. It is understood that !
Lees, who is obligated to Kelly for - 1 _.i - I
ins his son License Collector some time [
ago, promise! to ignore the Supervisors
in the selection of the men who are to i
drive the patrol wagons This means that ]
the Supervisors will have nothing to say i
about the appointments of the new ofs- I
cers.

BOXERS NOW
AWAIT THE
TIMER'S CALL
Weights Russell and
Van Euskirk Meet To-
Night.
Alter a ucciucti lUU in Uiixing lor aouio
months the National Athletic Club will
promote two bouts In the arena at Wood
ward's Pavilion to-night. Two men well
known here will meet two others who
have never performed here, but who come
with good reputations as boxers.
"P.ufe" Turner, the colored lightweight,
who meets "Jimmy" Reilly, ha made
quite a reputation In Stockton, where he
has met and vanquished many ambitious
boxers from this city. He enters the ring
to-night with the prestige of one victory
over his present opponent. For Reilly it
is claimed he was ill at the time and
should never have tried to keep his en
gagement. He was stopped In the third
round, nature (using to sustain him
further. Possibly taking a line on that
bout betting men have installed Turner
favorite at 10 to 7. He did all his training
at Stockton and came down here ester
day to rest until time to enter the ring.
Van Busktrk. on bis past performances,
has been made favorite over Russell, the
same odds prevailing as In the other bout.
The supporters of each man express the
utmost confidence In their representative,
and some of them must be disappointed.
Van -Kirk has been listed with hard
knocks in the ring and has made a cred
itable towing. He is pronounced in bet
ter condition now ban at any time In his
career as a boxer.
Russell's ability to withstand the buffet
ing he Is bound to receive in the ring la
the point to be- tested. He is credited
with great strength and has been develop
ing cleverness with great rapidity under
the mentorship of Alex Greggains, one of
the cleverest of the light heavy-weights.
Russell has aspirations as a boxer and
must Win quickly and cleverly to-night
In order to get a fair start toward the
elusive championship. He has youth.
strength, cleverness and other qualifica
tions. It will require an actual contest
to develop what qualifications he may
lack.
"Billy" Jordan, who has done duty
times without number as master of cere
monies, will be the referee for both bouts.

MAY W FLEW
AROUND THE
OVAL AGAIN
Dr. Sheppard Never Within
Hailing Distance Three
Choices Beaten.
Plying May W showed her dainty heels
to ,'i trio of entries again at Oakland yes
terday. She was held an odds-on choice In
the betting, and came home "on the bit"
in 1:42 Hat. over a track made slow by the
rainfall of the night before. The over
sanguine conceded Dr. Sheppard a chance
to overtake the Calgary mare, but it
looked like asking a great deal of the
doctor. Tie was second Into the stretch,
but at the paddock quit badly, losing the
place to peaked-faced Ringmaster, the
rank outsider of the quartet racing.
The afternoon sport resulted in the
overthrow of three pronounced choices in
My Gypsy, Negligence and Lodestar.
Their defeat was not accomplished with
out a struggle, at.d they were probably
downed on their merits.
Tall and spare Sam Merriweather
turned off another coup in the opening six
furlong sprint for maidens, with Loma
Marie. Jim Bozeman was railroaded back
from Fresno to ride the mare, whoso odds
were hammered down from 5 to 1 to 7 to
2. Bozeman waited in third position
with her to the stretch, and then grad
ually assuming the lead downed Alaska
half a length at the wire. The latter,
away poorly, was much the best. Lou
Key ran third.
The six-furlong dash for two-year-olds
fell to The Scot. The St. Andrew young
ster was said to be Buffering from a re
cently contracted cold, but he evidently
runs best that way. My Gypsy received
the select support and should have won.
Unfortunately though for her backers.
Coburn, on The Scot, beat the barrier
fully three lengths and last* I long enough
to lead the tirst choice out by a neck.
Ten lengths away Druldess took the show
from Palapa.
Negligence ha? shown such improved
form of late that the Montana horse was
made favorite over Mamie (1 to win the
selling affair at seven furlongs, fourth on
the programme. Blair did take him away
in the had. and a furlong from the stand
looked a possible winner. He tired per
ceptibly the las sixteenth, though, and
Mamie beat him without an effort. For
the first time out Imperious made a good
showing, even though being a distant
third at the finish.
In the hurry to get aboard Lodestar, the
odds-on favorite for the concluding mile
and a sixteenth run, decided under selling
conditions, the previous goo I efforts of
Petal were undoubtedly overlooked. Th
latter mare came from the far rear the
last quarter of a mile, and though Thorpe
on lodestar had ail sails set he was led
out a scant length by the outsider. The
winner closed at odds of ! to 1. 1 Â»onat r
also came from the wilderness, securing!
the show .
Track Notes,
Owners intending to race at the coming i
Los Angeles meeting are requested to
arrange with Juck Atkin for car room as
soon as possible.
From information gleaned it is said
Billy Bruen may wield the starter's Hag
at Tanforan Park in place of Caldwell.
According to recent advices, Adler-Cella,
Tllle's combination, which had in view
the building of a new racetrack at St.
Louis, has tripped up. Suitable arrange
ments could not be made with the car
companies and the deal is reported off.
Joseph A. Murphy, who will assume his
old position as presiding Judge in the
stand at Oakland, Is expected here on
Sunday next. Charles F. Price and Ed
Hopper will probably not arrive before
November 1. â "-.. . * , >
The Schorr string, in charge of John I- .
Schorr Jr., will leave Chicago for Cali
fornia on October 21. The stable will be
made up of the following shifty perform
ers: Meadowthorpe, Sea Lion, Jackan
apes, 'lime-maker and F. W. Brode. The
impression prevails that more good horses
will come here this winter than ever
before.
The booking at Oakland is so good that
Hughev Jones said he had written John
Coleman, who Is up the country fishing
to come to town and get In on the ground
On Tuesday Bit of Fashion was an odds
on favorite and ran absolutely last. Yes
terday Dr. Sheppard. also from the Burns
& Waterhouse stable, started, ruling sec
ond choice to May \V, and was beaten for
the ace by Ringmaster, an outsider. It
was the first start this season of each of
the horses mentioned, and on both occa
sions the stable had a good commission
down. After the Dr. Bheppard race
Trainer Mike Kelly was ordered by the
officials In the stand not to ...start any
more of his string unless heft was quite
positive they were up to a bruising race.
In extenuation of the doctor's race Kelly
said the hcrse had received sufficient work
and he felt confident his charge would
finish second, but hardly thought him
capable of beating the favorite. While
Bit of Fashion ran disappointingly, Kelly
says be doubts very much whether the
filly can beat Mldity at the difference In
weights carried In Tuesday's race.

ST. LOUIS SECURES
A LARGE ADVANTAGE
INTERSTATE COMMISSION TO
DELIBERATE THERE.
Coast Must Fight in the Territory of
the Enemy Next Month for Its
Trade.
The St. Louis jobbers have won an im
portant point. The Interstate Commerce
Commission has decided to meet in St.
Louis to hear the suit to make graded
rates from the Atlantic seaboard to St.
Louis, to do away with Pacific Coast
terminals and to abolish the differentia!
between carloads and less than carloads
to the Pacific Coast. News was received
here yesterday that the commission will
not hear the suit until November 13 in-
stead of upon October 30, as originally as- |
signed; also that the Washington meet
ing has been given up and the entire
hearing will take place In St. Louis.
In St. Louis every newspaper that the
Commissioners lake up will naturally take
the home view of the suit and will pour ;
hot shot Into the Pacific Coast Jobbers
who object to having their business taken j
away. In addition to this all the resources j
of the St. Louis and Chicago jobbers will i
be easily mustered, and at small expense
at St. Louis, so that the number of wit- j

nesses that the Middle West can muster
will be limited only by the willingness of
the Commissioners to listen.
On the other hand, the distance from
the Pacific Coast and the time that must
be expended by delegates to St. Louis will
both tend to limit the number of wit
nesses who can appear to make a case
for the coast, It is no secret that the
wholesalers and jobbers of the Pacific
Coast were pleased when they heard that
the hearing of the Commissioners would
be held In Washington, and for obvious
reasons. The disappointment at the
change is correspondingly keen.
The executive committee of the Pacific
Coast Traffic Association will probably
name an attorney to-day. The subcom
mittee has reported. Until it is known
whether the man they have named will
accept the appointment to go to St. Louis
the nomination will not be made public.
A decisive report may be made to-day.
At a meeting of the executive commit
tee yesterday Charles Holbrook and E.
R. Lilienthal were appointed a committee
to visit the banks of the city to collect
funds. This about completed the assign
ment of work for the collection commit
tees.
A communication has been received
from parties in Syracuse, N. V., who see
danger to the trade of the Atlantic coast
In the St. Louis programme. The whole
subject will be brought before the Syra
cuse Chamber of Commerce for action.
Additional communications from other
Atlantic coast points have been received,
among them New Haven, Conn.; Hayden
ville, Mass.; Houston, Tex.; New Brigh
ton, N. J.; Philadelphia and Winsted,
Conn. The outlook is fair for a delega
tion from the Atlantic coast cities at St.
Louis.

TIVOLI CELEBRATES
BIRTHDAY OF VERDI
LAUREL WREATHS PRESENTED
TO THE ARTISTS.
San Francisco's Musical Cult Attend
ed in a Body â Jessie Eos
ter's Recital a Success.
The management of the Tivoli Opera
house struck the right chord when it set
aside an evening of the present grand
opera season for the commemoration ot
Verdi's eighty-seventh birthday. If ever
any man was entitled to such honor it
Is "that grand old man who. despite his
age, is still treating some of the master
works of music. There is not one com
poser who can boast of the versatility
in composition and breadth of thought
which characterize the works of Verdi,
.and therefore his name will always be
inscribed in letters of gold upon the
pages of musical history. There was a
festive sentiment prevailing at the Tivoli
Tuesday night. The extremely large audi
ence gave evidence of its delight by gen
erous applause, the performers expressed
their satisfaction by singing and playing
even better than usual and the orches
tra did not fail to contribute its share
to the grand success of the evening.
The laurel wreath presented to Max
Hlrschfcld by Dr. Guldo Uaglierl was a
well merited testimonial of esteem and
an honestly earned sign of appreciation.
And it was also quite praiseworthy of
Mr. Hirschfeld to include in his speech
of thanks the artists, orchestra and
chorus, as prominent factors in the suc
cess of this season. But while the con
ductor was thoughtful enough to mention
Avedanc and Salassa, he should also have
included Anna Lichter, whose energy,
conscientiousness and talent were leading
features during the last few weeks.
Laurel wreaths were presented by the
Italian colony of this city to Salassa. Ave
dane and Anna Lichter. The programme
was a varied one. consisting of the over
ture "Nabucco" by the orchestra, act II
from "Aida," selection from "Rigoletto"
by the orchestra, euphonium solo from
"Macbeth" by W. H. Colvert and orches
tra, the second act from "Othello." the
trio from "Atilla" by Ada Palmer Wal
ker, Thomas Green and William Schus
ter, and the fourth act from "II Trova-
i tore."
The entire performance may be termed
>; an ovation to Avedane, Salassa and Miss
Lichter and. in fact, the whole Tivoli
1 staff, including orchestra chorus and all
artists. On such an occasion it would be
; out of place to criticize in detail. It was
'a festive occasion; let the festive senti
ment not be marred by hunting for dis
i crepancies. It was one of the evenings
1 upon which the Tivoli management may
well look hack with satisfaction.
While almost the whole of San Fran
cisco's musical cult was celebrating
; Verdi's birthday at the Tivoli. Miss Jes-
I sic Foster gave a song recital at Sher
man-Clay Hall. The lady certainly has
; a very high soprano, which she uses with
â  much intelligence and a good method.
While her execution may be rather
i classed among the purely technical qual
. ity, she succeeds frequently to give vent
i to her interpretative faculties. Her voice
i is steady and gives many signs of much
I experience. The vocalist was assisted by
! Arthur Weiss, cellist; Arthur Ficken
i scher, pianist, and Mrs. A. C. Lewis, ac
j companist. ALFRED METZGER.
Boilermakers for Judge Mogan.
The Boilermakers' Association at Its last
meeting passed a vote of thanks to Judge
K. P. Mogan of the Police Court tor the
stand he took in dismissing a case in
which one of its members was arrested
for distributing handbills in the Potrero
A committee, consisting of J. J. Ryan
George Lillie. Joseph Mitchell. J. Furlong'
F. Murphy, J. Kane and B. F. Hall, were
appointed to convey the resolution of
thanks to Judge Mogan. ,-:â¢-,-
NO CHANGE
IN RATING
OF TEAMS
Oakland Steadily Mounts the
Column and Will Give
Lobsters a Hard Race.
They have metâ the Senators and the
localsâ and still the same conditions ex
ist. All the diamond cranks In town an
ticipated a hot close fight between the
two leaders, and nothing but disappoint
ment is expressed on the result, for each
team took a game and the third was a tie.
Saturday's match gave promise of some
thing close on Sunday. The great expec
tations were unrealized. In the morning
San Francisco played a game of baseball
that was a travesty on the name. Error
after error was perpetrated on the public,
which rose early to see the leaders and
the seconds fight in hot competition. Both
teams must have enjoyed some sleep be
tween the lapse of the morning and after
noon games if the quality of the game
may be used as a basis of judgment. The
result of the series leaves San Francisco
and Sacramento in the same position in
the percentage column, and therefore the
games at Sacramento Saturday and Sun
day will be looked upon by the ultra-en
thusiasts with as much interest as the last
series.
The phenomenal burst of speed that the
Dudes have been developing in the past
two months bids fair to work ruin to the
aspirations of the leaders. Game after
game the Oaklanders have been plucking
from every team In the league. Sacra
mento managed to hold the surprise party
In check, but none of the other teams
seem able to do it. Dudes and Lobsters
meet in this city Saturday and Sunday,
and Cal Ewing keeps saying "there is
nothing to it." Should the Dudes win :.ll
games they will top Santa Cruz, and move
from a place which they have held exclu
sively for many months.
The standing of the teams is as follows:
In the game on this side Sunday morn
ing Brockhoff at short began to do some
high class juggling. A change was then
made, putting Krug short, Brockhoff third
and Reilly second. Several pretty double
plays after this change has persuaded
Harris to keep the new order of things.
McCarthy will be seen in a new position
with Santa Cruz.
Harvey was taken out of the box Sun
day when San Francisco began dropping
on his curves. Doyle replaced him. but
the fireworks that happened made Harris
happy.
SCINTILLANT IN FRONT.
First for the Czarewitch Stakes at
Newmarket.
LONDON. Oct. 11.â the second day's
racing of the Newmarket second October
meeting to-day the second October Nur
sery stakes were won by J. Relss" Risby.
E. Herbert's Brigadier finished second
and S. S. Scott's Lottie Hampton bay colt
was third. Sloan rode Lord Hare wood's
Free Companion, but was unplaced.
Eleven horses ran the Rous course (five
furlongs). The betting was 100 to S against
Free Companion.
The Czarewitch stakes were won by R
A. Oswald's Sclntillant. W. Wilson's" Er
clldoune and A. Wagg's Mitham were sec*
ond and third, respectively. All the
American jockeys who participated in the
event were unplaced.
Lutetia, with Sloan up. finished first in
the race for the Cheveley Park stakes.
The second and third horses were St. N> -
dia and Sonatura. respectively. Six ran.
The betting was 7 to 4 on Lutetia.
St. Paulus, ridden by L. Reiff. won a
maiden stake. Corceypheus. with Sloan
up. was unplaced in a field of twenty. The
betting was 5 to 2 against St. Paulus.
Sloan, on Sandy, was unplaced in a field
of eleven horses in the Autumn handicap.
Scarlpant was the- winner.
Cycling Handicap Entries.
Through the courtesy of Chairman W.
L. Loos of the California Associated Cy
cling Club's racing board, the entries for
the big ten-mile cycle handicap next
Sunday will not close until to-night. The
entry list already almost equals that of
last year, and Mr. Loos hopes by holding
it open another day to exceed the num
ber. The prizes this year will be in
keeping with those heretofore given and
a fine race is expected. The Olympic
Wheelmen, who had a team race on with
the Sacramento club on Sunday, have
postponed their visit to the capital city
one week, In order that their men may
not be deprived of riding in the ten mile.
Juniors Defeated.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Oct. 11.-
The seniors to-day won the first of the
series of interclass football games, beat
ing the juniors 6 to 0 in a hard-fought
struggle which was rife with fouls, er
rors and fumbles. From a scientific point
of view the match was a failure, as it de
veloped neither team work nor strong in
dividual playing. The freshmen and soph
omores meet to-morrow, and the final
game will be played Saturday.

FOR GOVERNOR
OF WASHINGTON
The Colonel Is Now
Ambitious.
â Â« â
CHARGES AGAINST WHOLLEY
CLAIM THAT POLITICS CAUSED
THE TROUBLE,
Officers and Men Aw.it the Ac
tion of a Committee That
Is Looking Into the
Matter.
As a result of the troubles among the
officers of the First Washington Volun
teers, during which numerous charges and
counter-charges have been made, the
matter has been left in the hands of a
committee, composed of General : ihton
and Judge Thomas 'Carroll of Washington
and Colonel Duboce of California, and it
is asserted that a determined effort will
be made to have Colonel Wholl. of the
Washington Regiment treed to retire
from the army. it is claimed that the
entire trouble Is due to Whollev's Jealousy
of Lieutenant Colonel Fife and to polities.
Shortly before the war broke out Fife,
who is a Republican and who was a
colonel on Governor Rogers' staff, secured
permission to go to Alaska. While In was
in the north war was declared, and it is
claimed that he received a letter from
Governor Rogers stating that Fife would
be made colonel of the regiment that was
being formed in Washington. Fife im
mediately returned to his State, expecting
to take command, but upon his arrival
there he was told that Wholley. who was
a lieutenant In the army, had been se
lected for th. place. Fife's friends
claimed that Rogers and Wholley are
both Populists and that Rogers gave
Wholley the place through fear of the
politicians. He gave Fife the second
place, however, and Fife admits that he
agreed to be the "bumping block between
the soldiers and the regular army, offi
cers."
The trouble occurred as soon as the
region reached Manila. Fife and a bat
talion went to the Philippines on the Va
lencia, and when they reached Manila
Captain Lane of the Valencia gave the
officers and musicians a "spread. Whol
ley followed on th.' next transport, and
upon lean of Fife's participation in
the "spread" had him court-martialed for
conduct unbecoming an officer, the speci
fications being that he. had allowed the
enlisted men to imbibe too freely and had
himself become Intoxicated. Fife claims
that he was found not guilty at the court
martial but that he was suspended for
thirty days in order to protect Wholley.
iHiring that thirty days he claims to have
shouldered a musket and fought beside
the men.
The officers and enlisted men of the
Washington Regiment are making some
grave charges against Colonel Wholley.
They say that his animosity toward Cap
tains Fortson and Otis resulted in the
former's death. One of the officers, In
speaking of this incident yesterday, said:
"Wholley had no outposts and '.vhen we
were attacked he sent Fortson and Otis
to the front with a handful of men. As
they started to obey the oder F"ortson
remarked to Otis that it was all over but.
the death struggle. rtson was killed
In the first charge, and it Is openly
charged by the men that the result would
have been different if Whollc had taken
only ordinary precautions. When the
fight was at its height Wholley took ref
uge in a church and allowed the men to
take care of themselves."
Lieutenant Colonel Fife is as popular
with the men an Colonel Wholley is 1111
--popular, and an effort will be made to
make him Governor of the State when he
returns Washington.

SCOW SCHOONER RESCUING ITALIAN FISHERMEN.
TWO FISHERMEN
PERISH IN LAST
TUESDAY'S GALE
Their Boat Capsized
in Mission Bay.
Two fishermen lost their lives in the
northwester that blew on the bay last
Tuesday afternoon, while two more were
rescued by the crew of a scow schooner
when in the last stage of exhaustion.
Early Tuesday morning Paolo Grasso, j
Valentine Feloso, Matteo M irtino and
Salvatore Lombardo started in the fishing j
smack Pisa for the Alameda mud tlats. j
About 11 a. m. It began to blow hard and
the fishermen decided to return to fisher- I
; men's wharf. The big rug sail was set
I and all went well until the boat was off
! Mission Rock. A heavy squall then struck
the boat and turned her over. Luckily
I the must snapped and the boat came back
''< on an even keel, but full of water.
All the fishermen managed to get back .
Into the boat, but Grasso was in such an
exhausted condition that he died In half
an hour. For an hour the three men held
on, but almost every wave would roll the ,
boat over and then they would have to
clamber aboard again. When the struggle j
had lasted an hour and a half Felos i gave
up and died before his companions' eyes.
Martino and Lombardo were thus left
alone and for three hours they continued
the struggle for life. The wind increased
in force and the waves swept over the j
boat more and more frequently. Just I
when the unfortunate fishermen had !
given up all hope a scow schooner hove
In sight and as soon as the captain saw i
their predicament he bore down toward
the swamped boat. The scow's dingey
was towing behind and in it one of the
crew of the schooner went to the assist-
I ance of the drowning men. Martino and
I Lombardo were picked up and landed at
, the Potrero. from which place they made
' their way home. Yesterday they were
I still suffering from the exposure ana it
! will be several days before they tin g>
; out fishing again.
The Pisa drifted about with the tide
and yesterday morning was picked up off
Point Blunt, on Angel Island, by me of
the river boats and towed back to fisher
i men's wharf. All the fittings and fishing
lines and nets were gone, which will
prove a heavy loss to the fishermen. All
four men were young and single. They
made their headquarters at 10 Union
' street, but yesterday had very lit: to
say about the terrible experience they
i had gone through.
Search parties were out yesterday look
it. for the body of Will Snow-, the Chron
icle marine reporter, who was drowned
from the launch Sybil Tuesday night. Not
: a trace of the remains could be found, and
; the chances are that the strong ebb tide
carried them out to sea. Snow was a
great favorite on the water front, and the
feeling of regret over his untimely end
was widespread.
There are now a dozen transports In
port and half a dozen more k are expected
during the next few days. Last month
the quartermaster's department got away
eighteen transports in seventeen days,
and It Is expected that the feat will be
repeated this month. In order to accom
plish such a task there must be splendid
organization, and Colonel Long and his
subordinates must work in perfect har
| mony to produce such a splendid result.
The transports now In port are the
Olympia, Victoria, Hen Mohr, Pennsyl
vania. Newport, Manuense, Tartar, City
of Peking, Leelanaw and Hancock.
The barkentlnes S. N. Castle and
â  Planter arrived from Honolulu yesterday.
! Both had very' heavy weather off the
' coast and lost several sails while trying
1 to make port.
Joseph Marino was stabbed by Frank J.
iM' traldo, an 18-year-old bootblack, yes
] terday. Marino was taken to the Harbor
Hospital, where Dr. Cherry attended to
his wound. Megaldo was charged with
assault with a deadly weapon at the
Harbor police station. Edward Farrell
was also treated at the Harbor Hospital.
j He fell down the elevator shaft at 410^
Mission street and sustained a severe
scalp wound and possible fracture of the
skull. He was treated by Drs. Thompson
and Cherry.
Captain Peterson and the crew of the
steamer Aberdeen are getting great credit
among seafaring men for their excellent
handling of the steamer Aberdeen during
Tuesday's northwester. Owing to the
masterly manner in which the vessel was
handled the bulk of the deckload was
paved and the Aberdeen reached port In
safety.
Harbor Commissioners' Session
At the regular weekly meeting of the
Harbor Commissioners yesterday after
noon. Chief Engineer Holmes submitted
plans and specifications for rebuilding the
south side of ferry 2, including the' spring
line and the backing thereto, also for a
new apron and hydraulic lift. Mr. Holmes
estimates that the lift will cost $2650 and
the apron spring line and backing 19500.
The piles will cost, if ereosoted, 16000, and
with an artificial covering $2200. The sec
rotary was Instructed to advertise for bids
on the contract for the work.
An application was received from J. H.
Payson, president of the Santa Fe Ter
minal Company of San Francisco, for
berth privileges on the Main-street wharf,
to be used in connection with the new car
ferry slip. The matter was referred to
the chief engineer and the understanding
is that the terminal company will be given
the wbOjrf and P. B. Cornwall, the present
occupant, transferred to the Beale-street
wharf.
Attorney Harold Wheeler appeared be
fore the board to urge the payment of the
claim of the estate of A. Page Brown,
amounting to $3700, for services rendered
by the late architect in preparing plans
and superintending the construction of
the ferry depot. As there is but $1500 re
maining in the depot fund there is a ques
tion as to the ability of the board to meet
the demand. In the meantime, however,
the claim was referred to the chief en
gineer to verify, and by next week it is
thought the question of payment will be
finally decided.

At a meeting of The Call local staff,
held yesterday afternoon, a committee
was appointed to draft resolutions of sor

In his prime In the pursuit of his profession,
the members of The Call editorial staff take
this occasion to testify their sorrow at the
death of Will A. Snow, late of the Chronicle,
drowned October 11 In the Bay of San Fran
cisco. To every one of them his loss is keenly
felt and strikingly brought home. Out of the
blackness of night the band of death has
reached Into their midst and pulled him down;
and, with their feeling of sorrow, is one of
the Inscrutability of that choice To every one
of them he was more than the fellow worker,
more than the occasional friend. A compara
tive recruit to the journalistic ranks, he had
already won more than passing praise for his
worth. Ills honor was unquestioned, his ability
an.', faithfulness and success ln his calling were
not only acknowledged, but commented upon.
His life was an open book In which there ap
peared to be many leaves still to be written.
That book has been closed. His soul has
winged Its way from the waters that may
never yield his body, but sorrow for his fate
will ever dwell in the hearts of those that
knew him.
To the bereaved parents, the members of Th"
Call editorial staff extend their sympathy: to
the collegians who loaned him to -Journalism
that he might become one of Its noblest work
ers, they give that unobtrusive clasp of the
hand that testifies deep grief. For themselves,
they bow their heads In his memory.

TROUBLE BREWS
IN THE DAVIE

HE PROBABLY WILL NOW RUN
IN OPPOSITION.
Â«
Old Concern Is to Be Incorporated
and Lively Fighting for Trade
Will Ensue â Davis Is Ac
cused of Sharp Practice.
There is trouble in the camp of the
Davie freight and express lino of
steamers that run between San Francisco
and Oakland In opposition to the South
ern Pacific. . John L. Davie Is out. The
other members of the concern say he was
discharged in October, and now Oakland's
ex-Mayor rxpects to make it interesting
for someone. â¢"';'. V-"
Incident Davie is going to establish
another ilne of steamers and In a few
days he promises to have the Emma run
ning in opposition to the Mount Eden. At
the same time he is making a bold bid
for everything belonging to the Davie
freight and express line he can lay his T
hands on.- Yesterday he sent men to the |
Clay-street bulkhead to put a telephone j
in the office in his name. He lays claim
to the berth used by the Mount Eden,
and George E. Roland, the principal
owner In the concern, was before the
Harbor Commissioners yesterday to lodge
a protest. He was told that Davie could
not have the berth, and that If he started
the Emma on the route another location
would be given him.
A few days ago Davie put a "scratch"
crew aboard the Emma and took a cargo
of cement from Mission-street wharf to
Oakland. The stuff was contracted for
by the Mount Eden, but Davie bundled
the 330 barrels aboard the Emma, carried
It to Its destination at Oakland and col
lected the freight on it.
The Davie freight and express line
was formed about six years ago by Cap
tain M.Andrews, then master of the Stock
ton steamer Dauntless, George E.Roland,
then chief engineer of the T. C. Walker,
and A. B. Dorell. then purser of the
steamer J. D. Peters. About that time
the Davie 5-cent ferry had collapsed for
want of sinews of war and John L. Davie
was deprived of his chief hobby. The
three gentlemen named wanted a name
for their new freight line, and thinking
Davie one to conjure by, got his consent j
to name it the Davie freight and ex
press line.
Davie had no interest in the venture
save that he was to get a commission on
any business he might send to the boat.
The steamer Emma was purchased and
lilt on the route. At first she did not
prove a paying venture, as the general '
public seemed to be tired of Davie and j
anything with which he was connected. :
Dorell and Andrews sold out. and Cap- '
tain P. A. Johnson and Frank Davie, a
brother of John L. Davie, bought in. The
ex-Mayor was made manager of the con
cern, and while he had no money invested
in the line, still he got the same pay as
Roland, who was engineer of the vessel,
and Johnson, the master.
Things ran along In this way for years
and the Davie freight and express line
grew and prospered. The Emma became
too small for the trade and the Mount
Eden was purchased. Roland put up all
the money and John L. Davie and Cap
tain Johnson were each given an option
on a third interest in the vessel. The
Emma was used as an extra boat, but a
short time ago there was a chance to
! sell her and after the sale was consum
-1 mated the trouble began.
"The Emma was not for sale," said
George L. Roland yesterday, "but Davie
came to us with a letter and said he had
a good offer for the old boat from Stock
ton parties. I did not want to let her
go at the figure, but Johnson and Frank
Davie thought it would be as well to let
her go and get a better boat. I gave in
and the money was paid over by Davie.
With his share Johnson paid for his in
terest in the Mount Eden, While Frank
Davie took his and retired. Soon after
this I heard rumors about another line
in opposition to ours, so I began to make
inquiries. I found that the Emma had
not gone to Stockton, and on looking up
the records in the Custom-house I found
she was in the name of John L. Davie.
Then I found that Davie was trying to
get our berth in Oakland Creek, so I
thought it was about time to act. I noti
fied Davie that his option on a third in
terest in the Mount Eden would be re
pudiated, and that his services as man
ager of the Davie freight and express
line were no longer required.
"Davie retaliated by telling me that he
would lay claim to our berth on the San
Francisco water front and to our office
in the Clay street bulkhead. Yesterday
he sent linemen down to put a telephone
In our freight office, but Captain John
son threw them out. Thinking he might
attempt to run the Emma Into our slip, I
went before the Harbor Commissioners
to-day and they told me Davie could not
have the Mount Eden's berth, but would
be accommodated elsewhere. We had a
contract to carry 336 barrels of cement
from San Francisco to Oakland, but Davie
took the stuff aboard the Emma and de
livered It. However, we will let that pass,
but Davie has now nothing whatever to
do with the Davie freight and express
line.
"Hugh S. Dimond now has an option
on the liii". and If the deal goes through
a new company will be Incorporated with
Mr. Dimond at the head of it. A larger
I and faster steamer will be added to the
I fleet, as the amount of business we are
I now doing demands it. Captain John
son and I will remain with the venture
and I don't think Davie's opposition will
do us much harm. He threatens us with
1 injunctions and all kinds of evil, but so
I far we have checkmated him and are sat
isfied."

Dried Fruit in New York.
The New York Commercial says:
"There Is increasing activity in all depart
ments and trade is certainly Improving.
Orders, for the most part, are for small
quantities, but they are numerous and In
creasing. No one variety has the call, with
th* possible exception of peaches, which are
doing much better than they have done here
tofore. Mall inquiries are increasing and the
conditions all indicate Improvement.
"Peaches are the mo.-" active sort on the
list and prices are up another fraction, with '
demand rood and pros] of a further in
crease promising. There is a scarc'ty or some
Sizes, and the discovery of the deficiency has
caused Increased firmness in all sizes and
grades.
"Prunes are steady, with prices tending up
ward on the four sizes, when all are obtain
able. Nineties are scarce and command a
premium, and most sales are of the three sizes,
rather than pay a premium for the nineties!
No heavy sales are reported, but the aggre
gate of the one and two caWnts make a fair
trade and tend to keep prices up. No new
figures have been given out on the crop, :
hence It Is assumed that previous statements
are substantially correct.
"Trade In raisins is quiet and conditions are
unchanged. Only small lots are being taken
by Individual buyers, but the total amount is
a large aggregate each day. The high prices
frighten buyers, and they are waiting for a
possible change in F.!tuation, but the Indica
tions are that none will occur for some time
yet. The only possible modification of pres
ent conditions Is the importation of foreign
goods, which can be laid down here at a lower
price than domestic goods can be bought."
The Hay Market.
The circular of Somers * Co. says:
"Comparatively speaking receipts of Hay
have been running rather light for the week
ending to-day, the total being about 3500 tons.
In comparison with 5000 tons for the seven
days preceding. In spite of this fact no im
provement can be noted in any way on the :
market here, but on the contrary a somewhat
slower feeling with some grades of Hay can :
be noted. It is true that the fields are grad- I
ually being cleaned out, but the light receipts
for the past few days have ,>een caused more
particularly by the inability to secure cars and
schooners to market the produce. There has
been a strong demand since the first of July
for transportation, and there Is still some
difficulty in securing accommodations, owing
to the continued pressure of heavy shipments.
"Alfalfa is becoming an especial drag on the ;
market at present, owing to the fact that ship
ments continue quite heavy and the demand <<, I
all but satisfied. Since Monday last there has
been fully 2000 tons of this particular grade
of Hay come to market by water, and for th<Â» !
last few days it has been seemingly impossible i
to dispose cf what Is arriving on the market i
here, it will probably be two or three months
before we will have any revival of the Alfalfa
trade.
"The quality of al! grades of Hay -Âv being
marketed is not such as to stimulate prices in
any way. The weatner has been dry and hot
all over the country, with the consequence
that the Hay is baling up light weight, of
rather indifferent color and quite short and
brittle. A car of choice Hay Is becoming a
rarity with us now." '*

EASTERN MARKETS
New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK, Oct. 11.â The stock fell flat
j again to-day. The dullness was made evident j
that yesterday's upward spurt was due almost
: entirely to covering by shorts, who to-day I
were inclined to regret their precipitance. The
warlike situation between England and the
Transvaal was almost without effect. In fact, ]
the London market seemed to feel rather en- j
couraged than otherwise over the termination I
of the uncertainty, and operators there were ,
inclined to bid up the prices of some of the )
American stocks in sympathy with the ad- :
vance of the Kafiirs stocks. The rise was
short-lived on this side anu the dragging
tendency of prices was not much changed at j
any time until the close of the market at j
prices below fast night's level all around. The *
money market was distinctly easier. The ac- j
tion of London has had the effect of allaying
apprehension in Wall street, but it is peroeived
n.j.l whatever relief is afforded is not likely
to furnish a supply of surplus funds for the
benefit o: stock speculators. Business in bonds '
was very well distributed and the tendency of j
prices was downward. Total sales par value, j

London Market.
NEW YORK. Oct. 11.â The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram says:
The ultimatum from the Transvaal Republic
created no excitement in the markets here to
day, having been received yesterday without
anxiety. There was a drooping tendency in
most departments, however, until near the
close, when a slightly better tone developed on
the disclosure of the smallness of the open po
sition. Consols were down a little from yes
terday's top price at 103 9-16. The opinion ex
pressed on the market here in, so far as mili
tary operations ln South Africa are concerned,
there -will be a deadlock practically until the
British army corps begins to advance In De-
cember. American securities opened firm and
developed strength, but In the absence of New
York support they sagged toward the close.
The Bank of England bought Â£ 176.000 gold in
bars and Â£16,000 in French coin.
Money was slack, little business in call loans.
Spanish fours were i.V\, Tlntos 47% and Ana

part of the time was 72% c. During the after
noon the market again became strong and
decidedly active on reports of big seaboard
engagements and an excellent cash demand at

fessional traders, who bad sold during tho
early part of the session, covered as best they
cculd. This and heavy buying for the long

Cotton Reporter will say to-morrow: The wool
market has been decidedly quieter during the
Inst' week, the volume of business being tha
smallest recorded for several months. This
quieting down of the trade is not unexpected,
however, after such an excessive activity as
had previously prevailed. The situation as far
as prices are concerned is unchanged.
The sales of the week In Boston amounted to
4.2'-V ! pounds domestic and 155.000 pounds
foreign, making a total of 4.446.000, against a
total of 6,897,000 for the previous week and a
total of 1. 190,000 for the corresponding week
last year. Sales since January 1. 1899, amount
to 230.954,000 pounds, against 88.112,000 pounds
last year at this time.

FOUR SPECIAL
MEN TO HUNT
UP BOXCARS
Railroad Unable to
Handle Traffic.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
SGS Broadway. Oct. 1L
This afternoon Superintendent Agler
held a little meeting in his office at the
pier, the recessity for which is the most
favorable criticism possible on the pros
perity which is now being enjoyed by this
portion of the State.
For many weeks "he Southern Pacific
Company has realized that its freighting
facilities are altogether inadequate to
handle the business of California. In
Alameda County fruit-growers and farm
ers of all descriptions have been materi
ally handicaped because of the shortage
of cars. Orders have been given for
hundreds of new cars, but at no time dur
ing the past three months has the rail
road company been ------
tne service that their business demands.
This afternoon four of the most ex
perienced conductors of the company
were taken from their regular runs and
were instructed by Mr. Agler for new
cutles which consist of going over tha
whole of the division and seeing that no
car is delayed a minute Innger than neces
sary, and to rush ail era] cars to the
depot.
The instructions given these conductors
were very definite, and they will have re
dentials which will give them much
authority over scores of station agents
through Superintendent Agler's division:
They are charged with the duty of in
specting every car in any depot, and If it
be loaded, and for an reason un
loading is being delayed, these apec-.al
agents have authority to order the im
mediate unloading into warehouses or
on the platform if no other place is
available.
One cf these agents was assigned to the
route from Oakland to San Jose to Tracy
and back via Martinez. The second
route starts at Tracy and takes in b-;th
sides of the San Joaquin Valley and
branches, to Fresno, and back to Sacra
mento. The third route commences at
Oakland and goes via Benicia to Sacra
mento, including all branches. The
fourth route will be to all stations on
this side ot the bay not included In the
other route. It is estimated that in about
a week several hundred cars now lying
Idle or being unnecessarily detained will
be made available for new shinmer.t.
The conluctcrs started on their special
mission this evening.

Honored
Oakland Office San Francisco Call
90S Broadway, Oct. 11.
The ladies who are working with Mrs.
L L. Requa preparing for the banquet to
the Montana soldiers next Saturday have
completed ail their arrangements and as
sure the executive committee that there
will be nothing lacking when the 2000
soldiers who are expected sit down at
the tables under the willows. The threat- I
ening weather of to-day and the sudden
shower of last night are causing a little
anxiety to those having tne supervision
of the ce'ebration. but there has always
been a stroke of good luck in this city
whenever it has attempted to do any
thing big. and with one exception, when
the naughtily inclined accepted a Mar- ,
day benefit from the racetrack people for
Fabiola Hospital, there baa always been
=upert> weather when specially desired. !
The ladies at their final meeting received
assurance that there would be no diffi
culty tn securing sufficient food, though
they are .still depending on the genercsity
of all those who on fi-raer occasions have
sent well-rilled baskets to assist pubile
banquets.
Xo food will be received after noon en !
Friday, as the committee will require all
Friday afternoon and night ir. which to j
arrange the eatables and prepare It for
removal to the willows, wnere the ban- j
quet is to be served.
At the tabernacle on Saturday evening
the medal fund committee has arranged
to present the medals to the returned
Alameda County volunteers. A street
parade will be one of the evening feat
ure. Company a of the National Guurd
and Company A of the Veteran Reserve
will act as escort to Companies F and G
of the old Eighth California Regiment
and the sixty or seventy men who saw
eervice in the Philippines with the various
regiments. The escort and the soldiers
will assemble at the armory at 7:15 o'clock
on Saturday evening and will march down
Broadway, up Washington street and
across to the Tabernacle, with the biggest
band that can be obtained. The plan of
presenting the certificates to the returned
volunteers at the same time has been
abandoned, as it would require more time
and labor arranging the certificates for
distribution than the public would care to
give.
After the Tabernacle demonstration
Company A will give a special banquet
to Privates Roy Petrey and W. H. Bur
re!!, two of its old members, who served
ln th? Philippines with the Fourteenth
Regulars. -v
The school children have all been as

SAYS THE DOCTOR
STOLE WIFE'S LOVE
OAKLAND. Oct. 11.â W. A. Boscow has begun proceedings to secure a di
vorce from his wife. A few months ago the romance of the Boscows
and the doctor was made public, but now it has taken that form where
all the secrets are likely to be revealed.
Dr. 11. L. Anderson less than a year ago was arrested for practic
ing medicine without a license. While in prison he told a queer tale.
He said that although he had been arrested ostensibly at the instigation of
the Health Officers, his real enemy was William Boscow. Anderson said that
Boscow was needlessly jealous cf his attentions to Mrs. Boscow. In fact, An
derson talked so much that Bo- Â« had to do some talking in public to square
himself. Boscow blames all his family troubles to Dr. Anderson. In the fall
of last year Dr. Anderson md his wife went to board with the Boscows. It
was while boarding there that Boscow saw enough of Dr. Anderson's practices,
medical and otherwise, to induce him to have the doctor arrested. But when
tried in the Police Court he was acquitted, and the doctor talked of having
Boscow arrested for misrepresentation, but over all their troubles hung the
cloud of the women In the affair, and nothing more was heard of it.
New Bescow claims that Dr. Anderson has alienated his wife's affections.
and in the suit there are some very interesting statements and suggestions.
Mrs. Boscow has also secured legal stance, and has promised that her
end of the fight shall not lack in activity or interest.
on Saturday. General Funston will lead
them. Governor Stanley ami his entire
staff will also come.

One of the most brilliant weddings of '
the season took piace this afternoon at 1 :
o'clock at Trinity Episcopal Church, when
Miss Martha Bell Mhoon and Frederick 'â 
English Magee were married in the pres- I
ence of a large and very fashionable audi- j
ence.
The church was made a perfect autumn
bower by the elaborate decorations of
autumnal foliage. The chancel was ar
tistic in tropical plants and gorgeous pink
chrysanthemums. The afternoon light
through the stained glass windows made
the scene extremely picturesque.
Long before the hour the church was
filled with the representative families of
the city, and promptly at 4 o'clock, to the
music of Lohengrin, the wedding party
; appeared. The best man was Walter Ma
! gee, and the ushers were Horace Miller,
! Sam Bell McKee, Samuel McKee Mhoon.
Vail Bake well, Sheffield Sanborn and
Frank King.
Following them were the bridesmaids,
the Misses Florence Dunham, Florence
Selby, Juliet Garber and Helen Boss.
After them came the maid of honor. Miss
Amy Marguerite McKee, and following l
her was the bride, leaning on the arm of
her father. Major John B. Mhoon.
i The costumes worn by the I ride and her |
: attendants were artistic and very elegant.
The bridesmaids wore gowns of pink I
crepe de chine, made over skirts of mous- i
seline de sole and elaborately trimmed :
with ruffles. They carried immense bou- !
quets of Caroline Testa roses. The brides- !
maids and the maid of honor wore bon
nets made of green leaves and pink roses,
so that when they were grouped in the
chancel the color scheme was very bright
and effective. Miss McKee wore a gown i
of white lace beautifully arranged over
white taffeta silk. She carried an immense I
bouquet of American Beauty roses and
wore a dainty bonnet made of them.
Miss Mhoon's gown was of white tulle
elaborately made over white taffeta. It
was trimmed with ruffles daintily edged
with lace, and the corsage was finished
with a trimming of superb Valenciennes
lace. Valenciennes lace was also most ar- :
tistically appliqued on the skirt. The bride
wore a long tulle wedding veil, and a
large bouquet of bride's roses completed a
very exquisite costume.
The ceremony was performed by the
Rev. Mr. Ritchie, assisted by the Rev. I
Mr. Bakewell, after which the wedding
I party and the immediate relatives were j
driven to the home of the bride, which |
was superbly decorated for the occasion, j
After an informal reception the wedding
supper was served. The bride's table was I
prettily -rated with pink. An immense
basket filled with La France roses was in
the center of the table, and the candela
bra were bright with pink shades. At the
bride's table were Mr. and Mrs. Frederick
English Magee, Miss Amy McKee. Samuel
McKee Mhoon, Florence Selby, James Mc- |
Kee. Carrie Haven, Horace Miller. Fanny |

left for San Francisco. The bride's going j
away gown was made of dark navy blue
cloth; with a navy blue traveling hat to
match.
There were many guests from San Fran
cisco, and the costumes were the most
elaborate seen at any social gathering this
season. The bride has been a very popu- '

Thomas H. Way, Who Taught San
Francisco's First School, Laid
to Rest.
ALAMEDA, Oct. 11.â The funeral of the
late Thomas H. Way took place at 11
o'clock this morning from the residence.
comer of Madison and Market streets.
Rev. W. W. Scudder officiated.
Deceased was a pioneer of the State,
having come to California during the first
rush for gold. He located in San Fran
cisco, and during the year 1*49 Mr. Way
and his wife taught the first school
opened In San Francisco and took the
first pupils to receive instruction in that
city.
Mr. and MrÂ«. Way were both born In
England, in which country they had both
been thoroughly educated. Mr. Way was
an accomplished Latin and Greek scholar,
and Mrs. Way. whose maiden name was
Maria Wheeler, was proficient in music
and French particularly. The young peo
ple both went to Sydney. Australia, and
there met and were married, fifty years
ago this month. They had decided to come
to San Francisco and open a school there,
and Mr. Way had a house ready built, in
sections, to take along. They embarked
for the new El Dorado at once, spending
their honeymoon on the ocean. Arriving
in San Francisco, they put their house
together and in due time put up a sign
that pupils would be taken, the first of
the kind in the then rapidly growing min
ing camp. The school prospered from the
start, and i; was not long before It oe
came necessary to seek larger quarters
A larger building was erected on Bryant
street, in the old South Park district, to
which the school was later on removed.
In the earlier days they received as high
as Â». X) per month for the tuition of a sin
gle pupil. The greater part of the couple's
active life was given up to their private
school. For a brief period they were em
ployed at the University of the Pacific,
he as a teacher of Latin and Greek and
she as a teacher of music. They contin
ued their residence in South Park, San
Francisco, until seven years ago, when
they came to this city to reside
Mr. Way was -in earnest Christian and
devoted a great deal of time to church
and mission work. For many years ue
was superintendent of the Chinese Sun
day school of the First Congregational
Church of San Francisco. He was also a
deacon of that church. Since his residence
in this city Mr. Way has been prominent
in the First Congregational Church here
and was greatly respected and esteemed'
by all who knew him. Mrs. Way survives
her husband.

LOG RAFTS A MENACE TO
SHIPS AND PASSENGERS
THOUSANDS OF LIVES ENDAN
GERED BY DERELICTS.
I The gigantic log rafts, whose tendency !
| to go off on cruises by themselves while
j being towed from port to port along the!
| Pacific Coast have rendered them a source
I of great danger to shipping, are doomed.
; Representatives of a number of influential
; organizations of San Francisco met in the :
ferry building last night and organized a
committee for the purpose of securing the
passage of a bill by Congress prohibiting
these unwieldy masses of lumber from en- I
tering or leaving any port on this coast.
Among those present were: Cap
tain H. Taylor (president), R. j
N. Pippey (secretary). Captain L. i
U. Harvey of the Masters' and Pilots'
Association, President Thomas McConneli I
' and John Hoyson of the Shipwrights As- I
1 sociation. Secretary A. Furuseth and W.
Macarthur of the Seamen's Union and j
Captain Thomas Wallace of the Pacific
Coast Steamship Company. Notice was
also received that James Tyson had been
I appointed to represent the Chamber of \
Commerce and H. Jacobson to represent
the Mutual Life Insurance Company. The
Calkers" Union and other organizations '
will also be represented on the commit
tee.
Captain Wallace voiced the sentiment <f
the meeting when he cieciareu uutc the
' log rafts were the most to be feared of
! ah dangers to sea navigation.
"Thousands of lives were endangered by '
'â  the raft of logs which has recently been
towed into this port after drifting about
for three weeks," he said. "Fully 20.1 M)
soldiers entered and left San Francisco
on the transports during that brief pc- i
! riod, in addition to the thousands of pas
: sengers on other vessels. If any of these |
; ships had struck that raft they would
have gone to the bottom, and enormous
i loss of life would have resulted. A dere
; lict raft is like a huge rock out in mid
: ocean with no signal lights to warn ap
; preaching vessels and no convenient shore ;
i to which passengers might escape after :
the wrecking of their ship."
On motion of Captain Wallace, the sec
< retary was instructed to compile a tabu
; lated statement of the number of ships
that arrived and departed from this port
while the â¢ derelict raft was adrift, to
gether with the number of passengers on
each and the value of the ships and their
cargoes. This statement will be attached
to a petition which will be sent to every
member of Congress, asking for an
amendment to the navigation laws pro
hibiting log rafts from entering or leav
ing a port on the Pacific Coast.
A bill of this kind was introduced at the
last session of Congress and passed by
the Senate, but failed to get through the
House owing to the pressure of other
business. This time it is proposed to keep
up the agitation until the measure is en
acted into law. An invitation was extend
ed to all other organizations to send rep
resentatives to co-operate with the com
mittee, and then an adjournment was
taken until next Wednesday night.
PROBABLY FATAL FALL.
I. J. Maccabe, Attorney, Has His
Skull Badly Fractured in a

is a friend of the sergeant, and while
Miller was preparing the- bouquet Mac
cabe fell and his head struck against the
counter. He was taken to the Receiving
Hospital in an unconscious condition and
Dr. Stephen found that his skull had been i
badly fractured and his chances for recov- i
cry were doubtful.
Maccabe came to this city from New
York about eight years ago and estab- ;
lished an office on Market street, giving
advice gratis. He is said to own mines â 
ln Colorado and to be worth about $50,000.
His friends say that before coming to
this country he was a Judge in England. \
He Is a man about 58 years of age and a
year ago was married to a much younger
woman. The union was not congenial and
after a few months she left him and is

AMERICAN MERCHANT MARINE
Interesting Data Furnished hy Secre
tary of Agriculture Wilson.
A letter was received by the Chamber of
Commerce from Secretary James Wilson
of the Department of Agriculture at
Washington in tesponse to a letter from
the Chamber relating to urging Congress
to promote a larger American merchant
marine. Mr. Wilson in his reply gives
some interesting figures, for he says:
I deeply sympathize â  with efforts
along this line, and will spare no pains
and neglect no opportunity to urge
upon the powers that be the wisdom
and necessity of such action. I am
well aware that this is just what you
need on the Pacific Coast. In looking
into the statistics of your commerce
after returning to Washington recently
I found that ten years ago your ex
ports from the Pacific Coast reached
J2C,000,000, while five years ago they had
grown to $42,000,000, and last year
reached $73,000,000.
This Department has now quite a
consignment of dairy products on the
Pacific Ocean going to six several
ports in the Orient, and had to wait
three weeks ln San Francisco for an
opportunity to dispatch the goods, and
finally had to ship them in a Japanese
vessel. We certainly need an Ameri
can merchant marine.
Â» â¦ Â«
Customs Watchmen.

on the wharves, the steamship compa
nies requested Customs Collector Jack
son to appoint the following named citi
zens as special customs watchmen with

H. Moore, Walter Parsons and Ed John
son.
Lombardâ John C. Lacey and Frank
Gallagher.
Spearâ W. P. Gallagher and A. Tedtsen.
A. E. Needham was appointed a cus
toms inspector to fill a temporary va
cancy.

FUNSTON SAYS ONE AGGRESSIVE
CAMPAIGN WILL END WAR BY MARCH
"Fighting Fred" and His Stanch
Kansas Boys Escorted to Camp
Amid Wild Enthusiasm.
IF tho winter campaign be properly I
conducted there is no reason why the |
Americans should not be sole masters
of the Philippines by March of next
year. This is the opinion of General
Funston of tho Kansas regiment, ex
pressed when he arrived at the home of
his wife in East Oakland last night.
"The situation ln the Islands," he said,
"has reached a stage where it is very
easy to see how to cope with It. There
must be no temporizing, no wasted sym
pathy, no foolish sentiment; It must be a
case of fight, fight, fight. The Filipinos
tire now In such a frame of mind that
they will not yield until they are thor
oughly thrashed and convinced that it is
useless to oppose American arms. I do
not say this unadvisedly. I have given
the matter many months of deep study,
and my knowledge of Spanish enables me
to converse freely with officers and pris
oners on the rebel side and also with the
peace envoys.
"We arrived at Manila last December,
which was two months before hostilities
broke out. During those two months the
officers of the Filipinos frequently came
within our line i, and I discussed with
them every phase of the situation. They
were very' high-minded, and gave me the
opinion that they thought they were well
able to look after themselves, and that it
was all very well for the Americans to
deliver them from the persecutions of
Spain, but that, having performed that
service, we should he satisfied and leave
them alone. The best among them are
ignorant. Occasionally I find a smatter
ing of education, but they are absolutely
an ignorant race and incapable of self
government. It is true that they. possess
much shrewdness and are cunning, but in
reality the chief trait in their character ls
treachery. It Is this which has enabled
them to make as good a showing as they
have made, but this is no argument, nor
can It be made so, that they are capable
of governing themselves.
"Supposing that they were to be left
alone, the islands would be a sceno of in
surrection without any possibility of re
storing peace. Only a strong power can
take hold of these islands, subdue the
various factions and place them on a solid
footing. I am convinced that the best
way to govern the islands ls to give them
a linn, stiff-necked colonial government,
molded on the same lines as the govern
ment of the colonies of Great Britain.
There should be a Governor General, who
should have absolute power over the civil
Government and also the command of the
"United States troops and any native
troops that it may be considered judicious
to organize. This may seem strange, but
I am convinced that as soon as the rebel
lion is crushed there will be an entire
change of heart among a large percentage
of the natives, and they will be quite
willing to carry arms under American of
ficers.
"With the 86,000 men now down there
and the additional 25,000 that will be on
the ground when the November campaign
opens there will be ample to walk through
the Islands. Sixty thousand troops will
teach those Filipinos the lesson they de
serve. But it must not be a campaign of
temporizing. It must be aggressive and
persistent from the start. There must be
no let-up. and no oportunity must be given
the rebels,, once routed, to recover."
General Funston was asked If he thought
General Otis' methods are best calculated
to secure the desired end.
"Being in the service," said he, " I
must refrain from criticizing my superior
officers."
"Do you think. General, that the same
tactics that have been employed during
the past eight months will Insure success
ln the winter campaign?"
"I do not. The winter campaigns must
be more forcible, and with the additional
men who will be there it can readily be
made so. There 1b not sufficient Judg
ment permitted to the various regimental
officers. Every officer as far along down
the line as a major in command of a regi
ment should be allowed much wider dis
cretion than has been allowed up to this
time. It is noteworthy that the most re
markable successes under arms have been
accomplished by small bodies of men.
Small bodies can move more quickly and
ere handler than larger bodies, and if
those in command of single regiments
were given only general orders and al
lowed to exercise the discretion which
they undoubtedly have, and which they
are well qualified to use, the campaign
will be more successful. I do not exactly
mean to say that there is too much red
tape ln use down there, but there is too
much concentration of power and too lit
tle opportunity to act Individually.
"The Filipinos are no match for the
Americans on the battlefield. In one in
stance, at Caloocan, where the Kansas
troops were engaged, we lost two men,
while I personally counted 112 dead Fili
pinos. This is, of course, not a fair com
parison, but the Americans are certainly

as much superior under arms to tho Fili
pinos as six to one.
"No criticism can be made, so far as I
can learn, on the Washington end of the
war. There everything seems to be work
ing along the lines which I should think
would most speedily accomplish the
desired end. Of course a great deal of
my Information on this point has
been derived from the newspapers,
but there is a general feeling in
the islands that the administration
fully intends to finish the war as soon as
possible, and that it does not intend to
permit any delay of any character.
"] must say that the newspapers nave
treated -.he news from the Philippine
Islands very fairly. I have carefully
watched tho . published news relating to
the Kansas Regiment, and it has been re
markably correct. Barring some very
complimentary references to myself, I
must say that I have seen no exaggera
tions either in regard to our side of the
question or the Filipino's side. I Bee no
reason why more fairness should have
been shown the Kansas Regiment than
any other, and therefore I must say that
there ls no complaint to be made on the
news sent out from the islands.
"The seat of all the trouble at this time
ls the Filipino junta at Hongkong. This
pernicious little body is keeping the war
alive. It is in communication with the
state, and it supplies Agulnaldo's army
with the hope upon which It lives. It
sends out leports of fearful disasters to
our troops that never occurred; It
Imagines all manner of friendly feeling
the world over toward the Filipinos; It
assures them of all kinds of outside sup
port, which ls entirely without founda
tion, and ln this manner keeps their
spirit alive. They are busiest Just now
circulating reports that the trend of
public opinion ln this country ls against
the American procedure in the islands.
They are informed by this junta that a
majority of all the States have already
pronounced against the policy of the ad
ministration and that they have only to
wait until the next general election,
when the United States will grant them
their independence and leave the islands
forever. Of course, such a policy would
be absolutely absurd because, as I have
said, the Filipinos are too ignorant and
are thoroughly incapable of self govern
ment. But still, this kind of campaign
ing has Its effect on the ignorant natives,
and they are induced to keep on their
campaign. ';?^"
"Agulnaldo himself is shrewd, but not
clever. To use slang, he Is a great 'con' !
worker. I know of no better term. He
circulates and corroborates all that the
Junta sends out and adds to It all that
Ids cunning Imagination can devise. With
him the campaign is a great confidence
game. I cannot see at present Just how
he will be benefited particularly, but I
know enough of his nature to be certain
that he is not working for nothing. He
is cruel, vindictive and selfish, and if his
people could only be persuaded to accept
tho truth of the situation they would de
sert him to-morrow.
"The very best that the Filipinos could
have done for themselves would have
been to accept the terms of the first
proclamation Issued by General Otis.
Those terms were broad and magnani
mous and were all that they could pos
sibly expect. Agulnaldo and the Junta
made such efforts to misrepresent this
proclamation that the natives were sus
picious of It and their great opportunity
was lost. But for the misrepresentations
of the Junta hostilities would never have
been commenced, but having been com
menced there Is but one way to finish
them. Â,- ;.-_â¢;
"So long as those fellows think they
have a ghost of a show of holding up
their end they will maintain the rebel
lion. But if the American army fight
them at every hand, drive them before
and completely convince them that it Is
absolutely useless to prolong a struggle
against such overwhelming odds then the
natives, I believe, will turn as a wholes

KANSAS MEN ASHORE.
March Through the Streets and
Are Greeted With
Cheers.
The Tartar docked early yesterday aft
ernoon and discharged its freight of Kan
cans on their native land.
In the expectation that the transport
â¢ would dock earlier in the day, the escort
i from the Presidio was at the dock long
! before noon, and it had to wait until near
i ly 2 o'clock before the volunteers were
j ready to march to the camp. There was
j no delay after the transport was made
fast, however. The men were rapidly
formed upon the wharf, which had been
j cleared by the police, and then the gates
were thrown open and they marched out
! into the cheering crowd, each man deco
! rated with the sunflower badge, em-
I blematic of the State flower of Kansas.
! General Funston and Governor Stanley

ings with the men. All the way up Mar
ket street traffic had to cease until the
boys in brown had passed by. The crowds
lined the curbs and blocked the sidewalks,
and every one had a cheer for the men
who fought so well.
The column passed up Market street to
Van Ness avenue, and then, when Its head
reached Bush street, the reviewing of
ficers, with Governor Stanley and General
Funston, turned out and watched the men
go by. They went no farther with the
regiment.
At the gates of the Presidio there was
another crowd, smaller but quite as en
thusiastic as any that had been passed by
on the street, which dropped in behind
the column and followed it noisily to its
place among the tents.
Then came an invitation to dine with
the men from Montana. The two com
mands are. old comrades in arms: they
fought side by side all the way from
Manila to San Fernando, and the Montana
men were among the most vociferous In
their welcomes. There was a fine meal
awaiting the Kansas men, and they were
not slow to make the most of it, for trans
port fare was no better on the Tartar
than on any of the other boats.
Last evening discipline of the strictly
military sort was not In evidence; the
] men were allowed to do about as they
: pleased. As they arrived at camp rather
I late In the day any one who wished was
i allowed to spend the night in the city,
i and many availed themselves of this priv
! ilege. The others made themselves as
comfortable as possible for the night, and
to-day they will settle themselves for the
three weeks that will elapse before they
shall be mustered out.
There was not much In the way of ef
! fusvle greetings on the way to the camp or
on the dock, for all the morning tugs and
launches laden with friends and relatives
had been going and coming to and from
the transport, and every one who knew
any one in the regiment had passed the
welcome before the ship came to â¢ the
wharf. i-;.;. â â >-â :â 
There is a month's pay coming to tho
Kansas men, and they will probably draw
this before they have been many days
ashore. The papers of the regiment have
been made all ready for the mustering out
officers, and there Is but little to do or .to
delay matters. The accounts must all go
back to Washington, however, and that
will take up the time while the regiment
ls waiting.

Monday next General Shafter will retire
from the regular army as a brigadier gen
eral, but It is still a question whether or
not he will remain as a major general of
volunteers, with the chances greatly iq
his favor. There Is nothing In the laws
governing volunteers which in any way
refers to retirement for age, and so it ls
quite within precedent to keep Shafter
ln harness until volunteer troops have
ceased to come and go through this de
partment. The care of the outgoing and
incoming volunteers has been a matter
much more serious than is generally Im
agined, and the fact that there has been
no trouble and no delays is due to the
fact that they have been well handled.
It is argued, therefore, that the Govern
ment will not relieve General Shafter
while there is so much work for which he
is eminently fitted to be done. Dispatches
from the East state that several of the
older colonels will be raised to the vacant
place as brigadier and then retired, their
promotion being in the nature of a reward
for faithful service and to enable them to
retire on the pay of a general instead of
that of a colonel, and that then the va
cancy will go either to Lawton or Mac-
Arthur, both staff colonels of regulars.
A board for the re-examination of con
tract surgeons, has been appointed to meet
at the Presidio. The members of the
board are Major P. F. Harvey, surgeon;
Captain Edward Evarts, assistant sur
geon . and Acting Assistant Surgeon A. J.
Pedlar. In orders the board is appointed
to re-examine Acting Assistant Surgeon
E.P. Howell, but it has power to exam
ine any others who may be ordered be
fore it.
MANILA LIBRARY.
Soldiers Will Be Able to Enjoy
a Variety of Good Literature.
The Red Cross ladies of San Francisco
met last evening in the rooms of Mrs. Gen
eral Greenleaf to prepare the preliminary
organization of a committee which will
labor to establish a free circulating li
brary In Manila for the use of American
soldiers and citizens. : ;y...
The proposition was discussed for two
hours, and in a few weeks the first prac
tical steps for the establishment of a Ma
nila library will be made. Already Mayor
Pheian. P. N. Lilienthal. Dr. Robert Mac
kenzie, Mr. and Mrs. John F. Merrill and
Hugh Craig have signified their intention
of taking an active part in the work. A
general committee will be nominated dur
ing the week, and on October 19 a meet
ing will be called. This committee on
Ways and Means will endeavor to enlist
the services of all patriotic men and
women to furnish literature for the Ma
nila library. The work will be directed
by. Mrs. Greenleaf, who leaves for Manila

Unwarranted and Malicious Suit
Against Citizens' Executive
Committee. â  â¢ â¢
John E. Talbot . . and . Edward E.
Reynolds, claiming to be members of the
First California Volunteer Regiment, and
W. A. Bourne, who avers that he was
a member of Battery A. have filed a suit
against the citizens' executive committee
and the finance committee of the volun
teer reception for an accounting of the
funds. The complaint alleges .hat up
ward of $60,000 was subscribed by the
citizens of San Francisco for the recep
tion of the volunteers and for the care
and maintenance of the sick and
wounded soldiers; that about $20,000 was
expended for the purpose, leaving a bal
ance of $40,000. It says that various
propositions for expenditure of the bal
ance have been made, other than that in
tended by the citizens. The plaintiffs
pray that the money be taken out of the
hands of the committees and given Into I
the custody of the soldiers, fur whose j
benefit, it alleges. It was raised.
The suit is looked upon as a malignant |
attack on the members of the committee i
Inspired by some designing person who |
is making a catspaw of the soldiers. The ;
committee is not contemplating the ex- i
i enditure of the money for any other I
purpose than that intended by those

THROWN FROM HIS HORSE
AND BADLY INJURED
WILLIAM G COWAN'S SKULL
' FRACTURED BY A FALL.
Surgeons Fear He May Die He Is
Believed to Be Well Connected
in the East.
William G. Cowan, who is believed to
be a member of a prominent Boston fam
ily, was thrown from a horse and per
haps fatally injured last evening on Mis
sion street, between Fourth and Fifth.
Cowan had evidently been horseback rid
ing all afternoon and as he was cantering
along Mission street his steed became
frightened by an approaching car and he
was thrown forcibly to the pavement.
The unfortunate rider landed on the
back of his head, sustaining a severe frac
ture of the skull. Cowan was picked up
in an unconscious condition and removed
to the Receiving Hospital, where Drs.
Dray and Starr removed a button of
bone from the injured man's skull.
After Cowan had been removed from
the operating room he developed symp
toms favorable for his recovery, but the
surgeons say his chances of life are ex
ceedingly small. Judging from private
papers and letters found on the injured
man's person it is evident that Cowan is
well connected in the East.
In his pocket was found an honorable
discharge from the United States army,
showing that Cowan served as sergeant
in Troop A of the Second Cavalry during
the late war. It was dated Jacksonville,
Fla., and was issued on October 24, ISS9S
Several personal letters postmarked
Brattleboro, Vt., and addressed to
Cowan at Denver and Lead ville, Colo.,
were also among his possessions, together
with an announcement from Attorney
Charles C. Bull. 50 Broadway. New York,
to the effect that the latter had forwarded
Cowan a telegraphic, money order for
$1500. â¢tw r -i
When Cowan was injured he was
dressed in a gray tweed riding suit with
leggings.

DEMOCRAT FOR
WARDEN AT THE
FOLSOM PRISON
Decision Reached by
Board of Directors.
The vacancy in the office of Warden,
! Folsom State prison, caused by the death
of Charles Aull. is engageing the atten
; tion of the office-seeking fraternity. The
i Board of Prison Directors held a meeting
iat Folsom day before yesterday and
! placed Captain Murphy temporarily at
; the head of affairs at the institution. The
! temporary appointment does not signify
! that Captain Murphy will be chosen to
1 permanently fill the vacancy.
On Saturday next the board will meet
again and at that time a new Warden
may be elected. At the last meeting the
'< directors discussed the subject, and while
! they did not agree to support any can
didate, did reach the definite decision to
appoint a Democrat to rill the vacancy.
Among the Republican aspirants for the
wardenship is Mark B. Ivory of Byron,
who was formerly Sheriff of Contra Costa
County. Mr. Ivory also served one term
as State Prison Director, succeeding
1 Charles Sonntag.
! The determination of the directors to
i appoint a Democrat to till the vacancy at
: Folsom will doubtless cause widespread
i commotion in Republican circles. The
I comment is made that Governor Gage
, may intervene and suggest the appoint
l ment of a Republican, There may be in
i Southern Cal rnia or elsewhere just
. such another man as Agulrre, who was
> elected to succeed Hale as Waraen at San
Quentln, but if there be one it is hoped
1 that Gage will not produce him as a can-
I didate. _ . _, __
Mark B. Ivory, who is mentioned as an
aspirant for the office, is highly spoken of
!by Assemblyman C. M. Belshaw. It is
said that Mr. Ivory made a first-class
: record as Sheriff of Contra Costa County.
I The information comes to The Call from
! an authentic source that the board has
: firmly resolved to select a Democrat. It
is not unusual for a Democratic Warden
! to hold office through a Republican ad
ministration of State affairs, and neither
is it unusual for a Republican Warden to
i hold under Democratic regime. The di
' rectors assert that a capable man will be
' chosen. __________________
Contract Not Binding.
A short time ago the new Labor Com
'â  missioner, F. V. Meyers, inquired of At
' torney General Tirey L. Ford relative to
! a contract made by the former Commis
i sioner. Fitzgerald. The latter in last No-
I vember leased rooms In the Clunle build
ing for a term of three years for the bu
reau. Meyers wanted to know if the con
i tract was' binding upon him. Mr. Ford's
answer was that such a contract is not
I binding upon the present Commissioner,
as a State officer cannot be bound, under
j such circumstances, by his predecessor's
: ; acts. â¢ --
