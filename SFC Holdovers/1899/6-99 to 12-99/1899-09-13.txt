1 stroke of paralysis. Mr. Van

lis wife and children. Gladys anc
Reginald. No physician was in
ittendance. The attack was very
;udderi and entirely unexpected,
md it was impossible to reach
my physician before death oc

,vho had been attending Mr
Vanderbilt. arrived at the house
ifter Mr. Yanderbilt's death had
>ccurred.
Many erroneous statement:
vere made concerning the cir
â¢umstances surrounding the
leath of Mr. Vanderbilt. and
Senator Chauncev M. Deoew
gave out the following statement
â  this afternoon:
"Mr. Vanderbilt left Newport
yesterday afternoon at i o'clock
for the purpose of attending a
meeting of the directors of the
New York Central and Hudson
River Road, which was to be
held to-day. He was feeling as
well as usual and had no
premonition of approaching
death. He reached this city al
!ock last night, was driven to
his home immediately and went
to bed about IO o "clock. He
woke up in the morning about 5
o'clock and complained of feeling
very ill. He called his wife and
immediately sent for a physi
cian. Mr. Vanderbilt died within
a few minutes and before any
physician arrived. T)r. Delafield,
who had been attending him.
when he arrived pronounced
the cause of death to be cerebral
hemorrhage. Because death was
idden the Coroner was noti
and there will be a formal in
quest
"The funeral will be held in St.
Bartholomew's Church, probably
next Friday, and Bishop Potter
and the rector. Rev. Dr. Greer,
will officiate. There will be a
meeting of the Vanderbilt lines
next Thursday to pass appro
priate resolutions of respect to
Mr. Vanderbilt. All the metn
rs of the family have either
called in person or sent telegrams
with the exception of his son Al
fred, who is now traveling some
where in China. A telegram was
sent to several points in China
and Japan informing him of the
death. Cornelius Vanderbilt Jr.
The San Francisco Call.
sent a telegram from Newport
stating that he was on his way."
The news of the death of the
railroad magnate soon spread
over the city. Messages were
sent to all the relatives and near
friends of the deceased and the
family. Chauncey M. Depew,
who was a near friend and busi
ness associate of the deceased,
heel the house at about 7:3 c
o'clock. He was visibly affected.
He remained a short while, and
when he came out there were
tears in his eyes.
William K. Vanderbilt Jr. and
his wife called early and remained
s- line time at the house. Then
William K. Vanderbilt Jr. went
for his father and brought him t< -
the house. The father was so much
affected when he caught sight of
the house where his brother lay
dead that he clasped his son in
his arms and kissed him. They |
walked together arm in arm into
the house, shedding tears.
Mrs. W. D. Sloane and Mr.
and Mrs. H. McK. Twombley
and others called at the house j
during the day. There were quite
a number of people in front of the
house all day watching the car
riages drive up and the people
enter and depart.
Mr^. Elliott Shepard. Presi
dent Calloway of the New York
Central, Dr. Shepard. and many
officials of the New York Cen
tral called during the day.
A Coroner's physician made
an inquest into the cause of
death and found that it wa^ due
to cerebral hemorrhage. The
Coroner also viewed the body
and indorsed this finding. Per
mission for burial was given and I
the body was embalmed.
A special detail of policemen
were dispatched to the Yander
bilt house and the police are on
duty there now.
SAN FEANCISCO, WEDNESDAY. SEPTEMBER 13, 1899.
THE LATE CORNELIUS YANDERBILT.
Cornelius Vanderbilt Jr. and
Harry Payne Whitney and his
: wife arrived at the Vanderbilt
mansion late in the afternoon.
Mrs. Cornelius Vanderbilt Jr. re
mained at Newport. To-night
all of Mr. Vanderbilt's children
were in the city with the excep
tion oi Alfred, and he will un
douhtedly come home.
The home-coming of Cornelius
Vanderbilt Jr. was an unusually
; sad one. The estrangement be
tween him and his father because
of his marriage with Miss Wilson
had never worn away. ()f the re
lations between father and son
Senator Depew says: "They
were on fair terms. I think it is
a week ago to-day that I saw
them together at Newport."
Mr. Depew stated to-night
that the funeral would take place

street to Staten Island. The
burial will be in Newdorp, where
the Yanderbilt mausoleum is,
and where lie several members of
the family, including Commo
dore Vanderbilt, the founder of
the great fortune.
STERLING CAREER OF
CORNELIUS VANDERBILT
Refused All Aid From Relatives and
Boldly Made His Way in the
World.
NEW YORK, Sept. 12.â Death has cut
down the h^ad of the Vanderbilt house
and the Vanderbilt fortune three times
in a little more than a score of years.
Cornelius Vanderbiit, who died to-day,
was the oldest of the third grenoration
and it was the wearing care of the
Vanderbilt millions that brought him
to a comparatively early grave.
Cornelius J. Vanderbilt, "old commo
dore," as he was called, and first of
the Vanderbilts to achieve prominence.
Called for Help \
in the Night. J
â n January 4, 1877, at the age of
ter a long; illness. He left a for
tune of about ninety millions.
Wiiliam H. Vanderbflt. son of the
commodore, expired suddenly on De
cember 8, 1885, less than nine years
later, at the ape of 64, and his wealth
was estimated at about two hundred \
millions. Cornelius Vanderbilt, grand
son and namesake of the commodore
and oldest son of William H., was aged
ITB, and while the Vanderbilt for
tune has possibly r.<rt doubled as it did
between the first and second genera
tions, it has eertal â '.. rccreased tre- i
mendously. To call one who inherited
between eighty and eighty-five millions
a self-made man seems a misnomer, yet |
Mr. Vanderbilt's early history bears a
resemblance to that of the boy
who, almost friendless and without ad
vantages of books, hews his fortune
with his own hand. He was the oldest
B n of William H. and Maria Louisa
Vanderbilt, and was burn at Newdorp,
Staten Island. November 27. 1543. His
mother had been Miss Maria Louisa
KiFsam, daughter of Rev. William Kis- .
sam of the Dutch Reform church. It \
was doubtless from his mother that
Cornelius Vanderbilt Inherited those i
traits which made his life stand for in- j
tegrity, piety and public-spirited kind
ness. William H. Vanderbilt, during
the boyhood of his oldest son, was a
farmer, and he had thp usual hard lot
Off a farmer. The old commodore was
still engaged in planting seeds for that
great fortune of the future. Himself
a self-made man, he left his children
and his children's children to shift for
themselves, so that they might show
what was in them.
Cornelius had a common school edu- !
cation, and when he was 16 years old \
he presented himself to John M. Crane,
then the president of the Shoe and
Leather Rank, and asked for employ- ;
ment, promising to do his best to j
please. Mr. Crane read the letter the
boy presented. "I pp* l yon are a Van
derbilt." he said. "Are you a relative
of the commodore?"
"He is my grandfather," was the re- i
ply
"Why don't you ask him to recom
mend you?" suggested Mr. Crane.
"Because I don't want to ask him
for anything." The young man ob- \
tamed a place.
When the grandfather heard of the â 
incident he was much pleased. He i
asked his grandson why he had not
applied to him and received the same
reply. Early and late the new clerk
toiled in the Shoe and Leather Bank,
boarding in the city and going home on
Saturday nierht to spend Sunday. Then
ami th^-re he formed those habits of
method and punctuality that became j
such a ruling characteristic in after
life.
He was thrifty, saved his money and
was not dependent on any one. His
grandfather had been watching the
course of his namesake, and one day
he offered to take him to Europe. Cor- |
nelius had never taken a vacation.
He wanted one. The trip to Europe
would have necessitated the loss of two |
months* salary at $60 a month.
"I can't afford to lose the wages," |
said Cornelius, and he rose still higher j
in the estimation of his grandfather.
In everything but years the boy was a
man.
There had been established in Wall
street by this time the banking house
of Kissam Bros., and to this firm early
in the sixties Cornelius was transferred |
when he was 20 years old. Here he
worked as diligently as ever. He j
scarcely ever knew an idle hour.
Commodore Vanderbilt had gone Into
the railroads and made one of those
brilliant strokes that mark the Van
derbilt genius. He bought Harlem
stock in Wall street at 6, and soon
thereafter astonished the world by
paying an 8 per cent dividend and
sending the stock kiting above par.
Cornelius was transferred from the
banking house to the office of the Har
lem Railroad. Here, with economy hia

SAMUEL BRAUNHART IS
CHARGED WITH PERJURY
Accused of Having Sworn Falsely Against Ex-
Senator W. J. Dunn in a Damage Suit.
Bart Burke and John F. McGovern Swear That the Port Warden
Deliberately Misrepresented Them on the Witness-Stand.
Other Prosecutions Will Follow.
SAMUEL BRAUNHART, Port War
den, politician, agitator and , re
former, self-styled, has been ac- i
cused of the serious charge of per- â¢
jury. Braunhart's predicament is !
the outcome of his own enthusiastic i
desire to turn a political trick and to |
throw discredit upon an opponent who i
was once a friend and adviser in Demo- j
cratic politics south of Market street. The j
accuser of Braunhart is ex-Senator Wil- j
Ham J. Dunn, whose reputation, it will be |
remembered, was recently a matter for j
judicial determination before Judge Hunt.
Several months ago the Examiner, with
its customary freedom with facts, pub
lished something which was n->t true in
reference to Dunn. The Examiner de
clared in one of its news items that Dunn
had acted as? referee of a particularly dis
gusting prize-fight.
Dunn is very frank to admit that he will |
attend prize-fights whenever the inclina
tion to do so seizes him. He will even
admit that he bets on prize-fights, but he
Insists? that he has conscientious scruples |
against acting as referee for the best two
pluguglies that over battered one another J
in the ring. And when the matter earne
before Judge Hunt ex-Senator Dunn
swore that he had not even attended the j
prize-fights to which the Examiner made
false reference. Dunn was awarded $500
as a soothing balm to his reputation.
During the trial Samuel Braunhart was
a witness against Dunn. The Port Warden
took the stand as an expert on reputations
In general and that of- Dunn in particular.
It was here that Braunhart laid the foun
dation for his undoing. He swore that the j
reputation of Dunn for truth, honesty and |
integrity was bad. He said he knew so
himself and others had told him that they
knew so. Whr-n pressed to give the names
of his informants he mentioned among
others ex-Senator Bart Burke of Santa
Cruz, and now of this city, and John F.
McGovern. It would have been wiser for
SAMUEL BRAUNHART, ACCUSED OF PERJURY.
Braunhart if he had forgot the names.
Dunn was shocked, or pretended to be.
at the testimony of Braunhart. The two
had long been close political and social
friends. They moved and had their being
upon the same, political plane. They
fought on the same .side together and
what one received the other shared. But
that was long ago when Braunhart was
familiarly and affectionately known as
'â¢Buggy-robe Sammy" in token of a
touching tribute which he had made to
Buckley.
But while politics makes strange bed
fellnws it also makes strange enemies and
Braunhart and Dunn became foes. "Bug
gy-robe Sammy" became a sobriquet of
contempt, and Dunn became one of the
push. This lasted for a while and then
another turn of the political wheel sent
Dunn and Braunhart flying into the same
bed together. Both were in the State
Senate when James H. Budd was elected
Governor. Budd was a reform Governor
and Sammy was a reformer. The sad epi
sode of the buggy-robe had been buried
among the forgotten mistakes of politi
cal history.
Braunhart wanted to be Registrar of
Voters for San Francisco. He considered
that a long anl profitable experience with
touthside ballot boxes qualified him for
the position, but in his own distinguished
self he did not possess the necessary in
fluence to obtain it. He sought, therefore,
and obtained the support of Senators
Dunn. Mitchell, Toner, Blggy and Hen
derson. They pleaded with Budd, showed
how thoroughly and persistently Braun
hart had worked in the cause of reform
and gave every assurance in the world
thai the buggy robe was only an ordinary
affair after all.
Pleading was in vain. Budd had chosen
some one else for the place and Dunn and
Braunharfs other champions were told
that the position of Port Warden would
be given to Braunhart if he would retire
from the fight for Registrar. He refused
to do so" until Hinton was appointed.
Then congratulating himself that he had
defeated Andy Clunie he said he wou'd
accept the position of Port Warden.
Dunn and the others again importuned
Budd and Braunhart got the place.
There was a look of sadness therefore
on the face of Dunn when he heard
Braunhart tell what- a bad man he is.
It was a blow from an old friend. Braun
hart left nothing to be desired In his tes
timony. He was eager, emphatic, preju
diced. He was positive and uncompro
mising-. There was no question about It;
Dunn was bad all over. Braunhart swore
that Dunn's general reputation in the
community for truth, honesty and integ
rity Is bad. He knew so himself, yet he
swore that he was unfriendly with Dunn.
The witness declared that he had heard
Dunn's reputation generally discussed
and all said it was bad.
In particular, and here Braunhart over
?Â«pp:ied the bounds of prudence, he said
that he had heard ex-Senator Bart Burke
and John F. McGovern give Dunn a bad
reputation. Both of these men have taken
an oath before the Superior Court tnat
they did nothing of the sort. They swear
that thc-y never spoke to Braunhart in
reference to Dunn and never mentioned
Dunn'? reputation, good or bad, to Braun
hart. Upon these affidavits, which make
the iffaii an extremely serious one for
Brau:ihart, the complaint of perjury has
been based by Dunn.
Braunhart gave his testimony the lat
ter part of last month and Dunn imme
diately began an investigation. He found
that Braunhart had used the names of
at lea-it two men without authority and
in doing so had not only trifled with the
Superior Court, but had made himself
liable for perjury.
The first man whom Dunn saw was ex-
Senator Bart Burke, who swore to the
following affidavit to prove that he had in
no way discussed Dunn's reputation with
Braunhart:
In the Superior Court of the City and
County of San Francisco, State of Cali
fornia.
William J. Dunn, plaintiff, vs. William
R. Hearst, defendant.
City and County of San Francisco, State
of California, ss.
Comes now Bart Burke and being first

never at any time stated to Samuel j
Braunhart or to any other person what- i
ever that the reputation of William J.
Dunn, plaintiff in the a"bove entitled ac

for other of said traits, was or is bad.

Hay, Secretary of State, makes this em
phatic statement regarding the alleged
secret alliance between England and the
United States:
"There is no alliance with England nor
with any power und^r the heaven except
thr'se known and published to the world,
the treaties of ordinary international
friendship for the purpose of business
and commerce. No treaty other than
those exists: none has been suggested on

CONFERENCE MAKES
ANNUAL CHANGES
OF PASTORATES
Long Discussion Over McKinley'^
Failure to Abolish the Army
Canteen,
Special Dispatch to The '"ill.
PACIFIC GROVE, Sept. 12â The closing
11 of the California Conference was
far the most Interesting to the general
public that has yet been held.
The greater portion of the morning ses
was occupied in considering resolu
bearing <>n the Dreyfus verdict. The
rence expressed its conviction that
Dreyftta is innocent of the charge, and
extended to him and his family its hearti
est sympathy.
The statement made by Dr. Chapman in
hi.s report at yesterday's session that
d< nt McKinley violated his oath of
bffice and is dilatory in allowing the
â¢'army canteen" to remain unabolishefl
was discussed at length. Several of the
mnst prominent members, among them
1 >r. Dille, unqualifiedly condemned the
lent In this partli ular while approv
ing otherwise of his policy. Dr. I'rmy
said that the conference should demand
of the President, "nipt as a man above
others, but as our servant," that he ex
er< Ise his authority as commander-in
chief of the army to abolish the canteen.
Dr. P. D. H.v.ird then arose and warmly
ded the chief Executive, saying that
if there is blame in this matter it lied
With Attorney General Griggs and not
with the President. His speech was
warmly loyal to McKinley as both man
and statesman, and at its close Dr. Carj
roll offered a resolution to strike out or
the report any such reference to Presi-
McKlnley. After further argument
the report was recommitted and finally
adopted with the objectionable clause al
tered.

During the session $1553 was subscribed
for tin univi rsity, and Dr. H. B. Heacock
was appointed financial agent of the insti
tution.
Resolutions of thanks to Bishop Xinde
for his wise and pleasant presidency over
this conference were passed unanimously
by a rising vote, and resolutions of
thanks to the press were also passed. Pa

CORNELIUS
VANDERBILT DIES
VERY SUDDENLY
Continued from First Vnec
watchword and conservatism his guid
ing star, ho worked for four years.
Then he became treasurer of the Har
-1-m Railroad.
It was about this time that Cornelius
Vanderbilt married. The Vanderbilts
for four generations have married
young, Cornelius was 23 years old
when he wedded Miss Alice Gwynne,
daughter of a Cincinnati lawyer. At
that time he was laying the foundation
f<>r a groat business career and for do
jnesti' happiness. He was also walking
In the path of charity and piety. He
was a member of the Protestant TCpis
' church, leader of a Sunday-school
and a member of the Young Men's
Christian Association. He established
a rule that no one was too poor to bo
helped, and in time the demands of
charity and philanthropic service took
almost as many of his hours as did the
rare of the vast property that eventu
ally fell to his direction. There was no
public-spirited movement in which he
did not take part; there was no great
charity in which he was not a partici
pant.
Few knew what he did in this field,
but now and then by accident 'he pub
lic got an insight into his doings in the
field of religion and relief. It was not a
mere coincidence that the day his father
was stricken the messenger summoning
him found Cornelius Vanderbilt attend
ing a meeting of the directors of the
Episcopal mission. Nor was it a co
incidence that he was sitting. with the
trustees of St. Luke's Hospital when
he was informed of the sudden death of
his brother-in-law, Colonel Elliott F.
Shepard.
Cornelius Vanderbilt, dying in 1877,
left a fortune estimated at $90,000,000 v
and by his will placed William H. Van
derbilt at the head of the Vanderbilt
system, which was already becoming
great. Cornelius Vanderbilt was then
43 years old, but he had been In busi
ness continuously for twenty-seven
years. William H. Vanderbilt became
president of the Harlem and New York
Central railroads, and Cornelius first
vice president.
Cornelius soon assumed financial con
trol of both properties. In time Wil
liam H. withdrew from the presidency
and created a board of control of thÂ»
reorganized system, and Cornelius be
(ame chairman of the boards of the
New York Central and Lake Shore and
Michigan Central railroads. This meant
that, subject to his father's direction,
he was ruler of these properties. He
had a salary of $50,000. To this may be
added the house that hau be#n gi\en
him and some stock that gave an In
come of $10,000 a year, but he was inde
pendent of this. Commodore Vanderbilt
had left him $5,000,000, and this he
doubled by speculation in Wall street.
Gradually, as befitting his enhanced
I merit for the exemption of church property
from taxation.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 13, 1899.
FARMERS VISIT
THE STATE FAIR
Grangers' Day a Bril
liant Success.
INCREASED GATE RECEIPTS
ALMOST DOUBLE THOSE OF !
LAST YEAR.
Supervisors of Sacramento County j
Officially Visit the Fair and Ex
press Their Approval of the
County Exhibit.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, Sept. 12.â The second .
! week of the State Fair promises to excel j
1 the first in all respects. Greater crowds j
j are arriving, and there are accommoda- j
' tions for all. Grangers' day to-day was
1 a great success. The farmers evidently |
came to criticize on all aides, and they
1 declare they are satisfied that the State
1 Fair la a great benefit to the State and
i ought to be availed of by every section.
j They made a heavy demand for books,
I statistics and documents that the law
j requires the State board to gather and
compile.
Never before has such a profound in- j
I terest been manifest by farmers In the i
fair. They take especial Interest in the j
' practical silo on exhibition, in the splen- |
! did herds at the park, in the meetings j
! and debates of the dairymen's conven
| tion, in the dairy processes and in the^
1 unexampled poultry exhibit.
They have, by inquiry to-day, been un
deceived as to the character of. the fair
j and find that racing is not its chief inter- j
est, but thai it is a source' of support to ;
1 the lair; that not a cent of the State's j
appropriation poos t<> make up purses, and
that the speed interests are cultivating a
splendid market for California bred ani- j
i mals. The stock grounds were thronged j
i all day by agriculturists intent on gain- i
: ing information and comparing notes. The i
attractions of the fair are being added to j
I constantly, and new entertainment is be
-1 iiije provided for the multitudes. j
Thursday is to be Governor's day and
i Sacramento day in one. A large number
of military and naval guests will then be
prest-nt from San Francisco, including
Major General Shatter and staff and Ad
miral Kautz and staff and prominent Na
; tional Guard officers. The art committee
is lmw at work and will distribute more
. than $1000 in cash premiums in encourage- !
ment of art. The week is full of pfomi.se
! for brilliant attractions.
It will be interesting to note the great
difference in the receipts at the park and
at the pavilion for the first week of the
present fair and tho rpceipts of the first
, week last year. Whis year the receipts ;
for tho first week at the park amounted
tn *:>IM 2.'. as against $3227 60 for 1898. The
receipts at the pavilion for the first week
â  of the present fair were $5672 75. as against
$1818 *.'. in 1898. The entire receipts at the
park for the two weeks in IW* amounted
to $91^7 and the pavilion to $54flS Sn. This
goes to show that more interest is being
1 taken all over the Stae in tho State Fair :
than In the past, and it is predicted that
no less amount of interest will be taken |
In the fairs of the future. The present
favorable condition <>f affairs is clue to the I
Indefatigable work of the Stato Agricul- j
tural Society, in conjunction with tho
work of the local Citizens' State Fair'
Club.
The Supervisors of Sacramento County
to-night officially visited the county ex- \
hibit and were loud in their praises of j
Messrs Read and Waite and Mrs. E. :
Shields, the committee in charge of it,
for the manner in which they have so far
conducted it. To-morrow afternoon the
children of the Protestant Orphan Asylum,
and Foundling Homo of this city will at
tend the fair by special invitation of tho j
directors. There will be special features j
1 provided for the little ones.
There was a spirited nail driving contest
i to-u!ght between livp lady members of the
different granges in the county. Bach par
ticipant drove fifteen nails, the basis of
the iudges" decision being rapidity of :
! speed and quality of work. Miss L. Col- :
i lier won the first prize in one minute and
! ten seconds; Miss C. SehJok. second, in
one minute and fifteen seconds; Miss T.. :
Walker third, in one minute and twenty
seconds.
There was a California poppy dancr- by
Miss Pearl Hlckman. an exhibition cake

: which was preceded by a cakewalk by ju
-1 veniles; a cornet solo by Irene Franklin;
' a euphonium solo by E. Klotz. and an

: To-morrow night's programme of special
; features will be similar to that of to- :
i night.
The Caledonians will celebrate to-mor

h PARIS, Sept. 12.â Dr. Pozzt. an

âº Dreyfus is a physical wreck. He
X is thin and worn; his muscles are
âºâ  atrophied. He Is 39 years of age

LONDON, Sept. 13.â The Paris cor
respondent of the Daily Chronicle
claims to have good authority for
the statement that Dreyfus will
be pardoned, although President
Loubet will not exercise his prerogative
until after the meeting of the council

He adds that Captain Beauvais and
Major Brecon were the only two mem
bers of the court-martial who voted for
acquittal, and it was Captain Parfalt

the extenuating circumstances.

As he role up to Forsythe's home he saw

EX-PREMIER FELIX JULES MELINE.
Leader of the Anti-Revision party who is seeking the overthrow
of the present Ministry.
M. Mellne Is fil years of age and has been prominent in French politics
slne*> IBfT6, when he \v;is elected to the Chamber of Deputies, where he be
came a recognized leader. He wa.s Minister of Agriculture In the Jules
Ferry Cabinet (1883-85) and president of the Chamber in ISS9. He Is a bimetal
list and such an ardent protectionist as to earn the sobriquet of the "French
McKlnley." On April 2S, ]S!*>, nx the request of President Faure. he formed
a Cabinet in place of that of M. Bourgeois, which enjoyed a longer existence
than any other Cabinet Blnce the organization of the Third Republic â two
years and one month -the average life of a French Cabinet being but nine
months. During its incumbency the Meline Cabinet is said to have stood
llh interpellations in the Chamber of Deputies. The spring elections of ]R9B
having bee.ii unfavorable to the Government and its candidate for the presi
dency of the Chamber receiving a majority of but one vote. M. Meiine, on
June IS, handed to President Faure the resignation of himself and colleagues,
a new Cabinet being formed on the 2Sth by M, Brisson.
In the lone light for revision of the Dreyfus case M. Meline has been one
of its most violent opponents. On the death of President Faure he was nomi
nated by the "Progressive Republicans" in opposition to M. Emilp Loubet.
The Vatican Influence was rumored to be in his favor, and in spite of the
fact that on tha day of the election he announced his withdrawal in favor of
M. Loubet, ho received 27.< fotes out of Â£12 in the one ballot cast.
M. Meline had commended himself to the "Nationalist" legislators and
a large section of the Monarchists by his antagonism to Dreyfus and the
revision of his ca.se. He is considered one of the ablest men In public life
In France to-day, but his probable triumph bodes no good to Dreyfus.
CABINET CONSIDERS
THE DREYFUS CASE
PARIS. Sept. 12.â At to-day s Cabinet
council the Premier, M. Waldeck-Rous-
Beau, informed his colleagues that he
had received reports from the prefects
of the various departments which
showed that the verdict <â¢( the Rennes
court-martial had been everywhere re
ceived quietly.
Th<- Jnurtial says the Duke of Or
leans will have cause to regret the part
he- has taken in the Dreyfus affair,
adding that the English royal family
declined to attend the marriage of the
son of the Duke of Chartres, that tin-
King of Belgium has requested the
Duke of Orleans not to stay in Belgium
and that the King of Italy has forbid
den his nephew, the Duke of Aosta,
whose wife is the sister of the Duke of
a large area of land situated in different
Bectloos of the county; also town proper
ty in Esparto and Rumsey and the R \V.
Stephens farm in Solano County. The
consideration named in the transfer Is
$99,219 71, but that floes not represent any
thing like the value of the property. It
is expected that through the agency of
this corporation several heavy real estate
transactions will be negotiated in a short
time.

MISS WELL
FOUND NEAR
HER HOME
! Wandered About for Nearly
Two Days in a Demented
Condition.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
COLFAX, Sept. -12.â Lander, a small
station three miles west of Colfax, was
j thrown Into a great excitement yester
i day by the mysterious disappearance of
i Miss Rhoda B. Howell, daughter of \
John G. Howell, proprietor of the well
known summer resort, Menopolla.
Miss Howell started out for a walk j
Sunday evening about fi:3o o'clock. She '
said she was going for a short walk I
and would return soon. In about an
hour it had grown dark, and the fam
! ily. wondering why she did not return,
j began to call her. Receiving no an
swer, they searched the premises, with
out finding any trace of her. The neigh
bors were notified and the search was
kept up all that night. In the morning
Mr. Howell came to Colfax and report
j cd.the disappearance to the authorities,
â¢ and a number of men were detailed to
hunt for the girl. They kept up the
| search all day Monday and Monday
night, without success. The Yuba ditch
was emptied, on the chance that she
! might have fallen into it and been
i drowned.
This morning the flrebell was rung in
Colfax to gather a crowd, and every
[â person who could possibly go started
ito search the hills. They met with suc
i cers, for shortly after 10 o'clock Miss
| liowell was found not a quarter of a
| mile from her home on the county road
in an almost demented condition. When
j found her hair, which is very long, was
; hanging loose and was matted. Her
I dress was torn to shreds, and her shoes
were almost cut to pieces, showing that
; she had been wandering night and day
since she was lost.
Miss Howell said this evening that
sli" started out for a short walk. She
hart not gone far when it began to
grow dark. She then turned toward
i her home, but lost the path. She says
I she had not gone far until she fell, and
j remembers nothing until she was found
this morning. Miss Howell is resting
easily, and has a chance of speedy re
covery if brain fever does not set in
from the shock. She Is a beautiful girl,
16 years of age, highly accomplished,
and Is the belle of Placer County. Ev
ery one is rejoicing at her recovery.

ENGLAND'S
NOTE LIKE
ULTIMATUM
Transvaal Consents to Con
ference and a Peaceful
Settlement Predicted.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, Sept. 13.â A special dis
patch from Pretoria says the British
note which was read in both Raads
j yesterday (Tuesday) Is regarded there
!as a virtual ultimatum. The corre
j spondent says: It proposes a flve
i years' franchise, a quarter representa
tion for the gold fields In the Volks
raad, equality for the British and
Dutch in the Volksraad and equality
for the old and new burghers in re
! gard to presidential and other elections.
If these conditions are accepted a
! conference between representatives of
j the two governments shall follow for
i the purpose of drafting the necessary
I measures and of avoiding the introduc-
I tion of unnecessary conditions by the
â  Transvaal Government or the possibil-
I ity of passage of any new bills calcu
â  la'ted to defeat the reforms.
"In view of the fact,"' the note goes
on to say, "that the present state of
affairs in Sout"h Africa cannot be pro
| longed the definite acceptance of this
j proposal is demanded without delay.
Otherwise her Majesty's Government
will immediately take the whole situa
tion under reconsideration and will act
so as to bring about a settlement."
CAPE TOWN, Sept. 12.â Various un
official reports that have been received
from Pretoria predict the Transvaal's
acceptance of the terms of the latest
dispatch, which was read in the Volks
raad this afternoon and is understood
to furnish a basis for negotiations
which will possibly lead to a peaceful
' settlement.
81-.OKMFONTTCIN. Orange Free
State. Sept. 12.â The Daily Friend says
it has excellent authority for predicting
that the Government of the South
African Republic will accept the sug
gested conference at Cape Town. The
delegates will probably be Commandant
General Joubert, Vice President of the
Transvaal; J. M. A. Wolmarand, one
of the two non-official members of the
Transvaal executive council, and Mr.
Fischer, who has figured prominently
in some of the recent negotiations as
thÂ«> special representative of the Orange
Free State.
JOHANNESBURG, Sept. 12.â The
T'ttlanders of the Rnxburg applied to
the burghers for permission to remain
neutral In the event of war, but were
refused on the ground that as Britons
remaining In the Transvaal and refus
ing to fight they must be regarded as
enemies. The miners are being offered
Â£25 to remain on duty until ordered to
leave.
PEACEFUL SOLUTION
NOW SEEMS PROBABLE
PRETORIA, Sept. 12.â The reading In
the Volksraad to-day of the reply of the
Uritlsh Secretary of State for the Colo
nies. Joseph Chamberlain, to the latest
Transvaal note, was greeted with silence
except for some Interruptions from Mr.
Tosen and other ultra-conservative mem
bers. Its terms, however, have produced
considerable excitement.
There Is no Indication as yet of the
views held regarding it in official circles.
The Yolksraad lias instructed the Gov
ernment to dismiss Mr. de Jonge. Secre
tary of Education, for writing a letter to
the "newspapers accusing the ministers of
tho I'nlted Dutch church of Jingoism be
cause they wanted more English educa
tion In the state schools.
LONDON, Sept. 12. -Owing to the un
derstanding that Mr. Chamberlain's note
is to be published simultaneously in
London and Pretoria, only an inadequate
summary has yet been telegraphed. The
Iyindnn papers are Inclined to withhold
comment until the text is available.
Despite the fact that the note is de
scribed as an ultimatum, the balance of
opinion tends to regard it as a rather
moderate document, since, apparently, it
does not fix a definite time limit, leaves
the real crux of the dispute for the pro
posed conference and does not raise the
question of suzerainty. In a word, the
note seems to leave the way open to
further negotiations.
The Times, which considers the sum
mary obviously important, says: "It Is
Incredible that all mention of suzerainty
and the other matters In controversy
have been passed over and ignored."
A special dispatch from Pietermaritz
burg, capital of Natal, says: "President
Kruger, It Is asserted in reliable quarters.
Is prepared to attend the proposed con
ference at Cape Town unconditionally,
provided he Is assured that Mr. Chamber
lain's latest dispatch represents all that
will be demanded by Grent Britain. A
peaceful solution, therefore, is highly
probable." ____^___________

BRITISH AUTHORITIES
DETAIN THE TARTAR
Transport Held at Hongkong on the
Ground of Being Overcrowded.
Special Cable to the Call and New York Herald. Copyrighted, 1599, by James Gordon Bennett.
HONGKONG, Sept. 12.â The British authorities here have d_etained the
United States transport Tartar on the ground that she is overcrowded. She
will not be permitted to sail unless she leaves 450 men behind under the
present ruling. American Consul General Wildman maintains that the Tar
tar, being an American troop ship, is not subject to British laws. The
British authorities are now considering the protest which Mr. Wildman has
filed.
Formal complaint has been lodged with the American Consul General by
discharged soldiers on board against the condition of the Tartar.
WASHINGTON, Sept. 12.â Secretary Root said this evening that he had
received no advices regarding the action of Hongkong authorities in de
taining the transport Tartar because of her alleged overcrowded condition.
Brigadier General Ludington. Quartermaster General, said this after
noon that the Tartar was loaded at Manila hy General Otis. She had 1230
men on board, and this number is not sufficient to overcrowd her. Even if
she were overcrowded, he said the British authorities could have no ground
for demanding that 450 men be removed from the ship, as she Is an Amer
ican naval vessel and subject to American jurisdiction only. If the Gov
ernor or Hongkong has detained the Tartar, representations will probably
be made to Great Britain on the subject.
The tribune of arbitration at Geneva held that "the privilege of extra
terrltorialty, accorded to vessels of war, had been admitted into the law of
nations," and under this provision the Tartar, which is a Government
transport, is amenable only to American laws.
No trouble is anticipated by the authorities in securing the release of the
Tartar with all men placed on board the ship at Manila, but when she ar
rives at San Francisco full reports will be expected from the officers on
board respecting the trouble they have had, and especially the reason for
proceeding to Hongkong instead of to Nagasaki.

IN ONE ROUND
McGOVERN WINS
FROM PALMER
Brooklyn Lad Defeats the Eng
lishman, Gaining a World's
Championship Thereby.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Sept. 12.â Terry McGov
crn .of Brooklyn whipped â¢Pedlar Palmer
of London thoroughly in less than one |
round in the arena of the Westchester
Club near Tuckahoe, X. T., this after
noon. With the victory went the title of
bantam champion of the world, although J
both contestants were actually In the
feather-weight class.
The Englishman, although forcing the
pace at the outset, was really never in it,
and McGovern simply battered his .oppo
nent Into partial insensibility. The Brook- i
lyn lad's arms worked llko piston-rods I
and the punishment which he meted out |
to Palmer was swift and terrible.
The battle did not last quite one round,
the actual time of fighting being exactly i
2 minutes 22 seconds, at the end of which
time Palmer was lying helpless though
half conscious on the floor of the ring.
Through an unlooked-for accident on the .
official timer's part, the lads were sep
arated by the gong when they had been
lighting one minute. Bach went to his
corner, but the error was rectified in less
than twelve seconds and the boys resumed
hostilities in the center of the ring im
mediately at the command of the referee,
George Siler. The ringing of the gong
was as purely accidental as it was un
looked for, and the Englishman's handlers
made no complaint on this score.
From the outset McGovern seemed to
have his man well In hand, but his most
sanguine admirers never Imagined that
Terry would win in such short order. It
was a case of a hurricane fighter pitted
against a clever boxer, and the fighter
won. McGovern Is a veritable fighting
machine and he went at his adversary j
with bulldog determination and lightning |
rapidity. His arms were never at rest
for a moment and he beat down Palmer's
guard with his sledgehammer blows. The
ring where the battle took place was
pitched in the center of a stockade, in
which seats were arranged for the ac
commodation of 10,000. The structure is
built on the same principle as that in
which Fitzsimmons and Corbett fought at
Carson City. The prices of admission ;
ranged from $3 to ?!.'. and seven-eighths
of the seating capacity of the inclosure
was occupied.
The purse for which the lads contested
was $10,000. 75 per cent of which went to
the winner and the remainder to the
loser. In addition to this both pugilists
are guaranteed an interest in the privf
leges ruing from the kinetoecope pic
tures of the tight.
A more representative crowd of snort
ing men than that which gathered at
Tucka this afternoon never watched
a pugilistic contest. Of course the pugil
istic element was largely represented,
every boxer of note, from the top-notch
ers in the heavy- weight division to the
paper-weights in the amateur ranks, be.
ing ">n hand. Among the big fellows at
the ringside were Tom Sharkey, Bob Kitz
simmons, Kid Mcoy and Jim Corbett.
Each of this Quartet met with a warm
reception, but when John L. Sullivan
walked down the aisle and took a seat
in a box at the ringside a mighty cheer
greeted him, and the big fellow bowed
his ackuowledgments with a hearty greet
ing. Sullivan went to McGuvern"s dress
ing-room and gave the little fellow some
sound advice, which undoubtedly bene
fited McGovern, as the subsequent events
proved. ']"..â  were hundreds of port*
ing men from all over the United States,
and a large number of the racetrack con
tingent was in evidence.
When the boys entered the ring a fair
estimate of the attendance would place
the number at 9000. McGovern was a
strong favorite in the betting, several
large wagers being made at odds of 100
to 80, and later on these odds were in
creased to 100 to 70, at which price all
of the British money in sight was picked
up. McGovern and his manager had sev
eral commissioners betting for them.
and they won about $8000 In the aggre
gate. McGovei weighed 116% and Palm
er 115% when they weighed in at 5 o'clock
yesterday morning. It was understood
that they would have to weigh in at 5
o'clock this morning again, but at the re
quest of Palmer's manager it was mu
tually agreed to have the lads meet at
catch weights without further weighing.
Both men were quartered in cottages
within a hundred yards of the ringside
from early morning, and at half-] 3
(â¢'clock they made their appearance in the
Inclosure. "When they reached the ring
side both were accorded a hearty wel
come. Palmer was the first to enter the
ring. He was accompanied by Manager
Bettinson, Sam Blakelock, Jim Ball and
Jeff Thome, all of England. One of them
carried a silk British flag, which he
waved over Palmer's head while the band
played "God Save the Queen." To offset
this McGovern's 12-year-old brother
perched himself on two stalwart men and
waved an American Hag, and the band
struck up "The Star-spangled Banner."
The action of the youngster cheated In
tense enthusiasm.
McGovern when he reached his corner
v,.:- accompanied by Sam Harris, his
manager; Al McMurray, Charles May
hood. Tim Kearns and Joe Fairburn. His
brother also accompanied him, carrying
the American flag, and another of his sec
onds, waving a small Irish flag. Young
McGovern, with the flag over his shoul
der, walked diagonally across the ring
and shook hands with his brother's oppo
nent amid the cheers of the spectators.
Referee George Siler handed he gloves
to the seconds, and the mits were soon
placed over the fists of the pugilists. Both
fads looked well and trained to the hour.
Palmer Raid he weighed 118 pounds, but
he certainly was three or four pounds
heavier than that, while McGovern looked
as If he would turn the scales at 120.
Very little time was lost In the prelim
inary arrangements, and when Referee
Siler called on them both lumped to the
center of the ring. Palmer fed off with his
left lightly on the head. Palmer, seem
ingly confident of success, forced matters
again: leading his left again with force,
but McGovern stepped back quickly, and
Palmer fell to his knees. When he arose
they got to work at close quarters, Terry
landing his right twice on the jaw and
then bringing it down to the stomach, at
the same time, keeping his head inside of
Palmer's swings Palmer landed a good
left on Terry's mouth, i,ut the Brooklyn
lad only shook his head and kept both
hands working on head and body. When
they had been fighting just one minute
Timekeeper Pollock accidentally rang the
gong at a moment when McGovern was
evidently getting the better of his oppo
nent. The principals broke quickly and
went to their corners, while '.he seconds
as well as the referee looked at the time
keeper in amazement. The referee, seeing
that a mistake had been made through
pure accident, called the boys together,
again, and they resumed hostilities after
a lapse of about twelve seconds. They
got to close quarters immediately, with
McGovern doing some heavy half-arm
work. Then he sent a left and a right to
the head, but Palmer countered on the

OPENING DAY
AT BROOKLYN
CLUB TRACK
Junior Champion Stakes for Two-
Year-Oids Is Won by Mes
merist in Good Time.
NEW YORK, Sept. 12.â There was a big
attendance at the Brooklyn Jockey Club
track to-day, it being the opening of the !
fall season and the rich Junior Champion i
stakes for two-year-olds being on the I
card. When the betting began there was
no question of the favorites, for nearly I
everybody wanted to back Mesmerist, so
the Bromley pair were backed as if it
was all over. Modrine, High Order and
the Madden pair were the only other ones
backed. The start was prompt and good
and Modrine was soon in front by a com
fortable margin, with Mesmerist at the
head of the bunch behind, none of them
being out of it. T'p to the backstretch
they flew, and although Mesmerist was
going easily in second place he was not
picking up any of tie distance that sep
arated him from the leader. As they i
rounded the upper turn, however, he j
gradually cut down Modrine' S lead and
when straightened out for .home was in
front.
In the meantime High Order and Ildrim
were very much in evidence, having come
up from behind, and at the last furlong
a blanket would have covered them. Then
High order began to falter, but stuck at
his work and finished gamely half a
length behind the favorite and a nock in
front of Ildrim. who in turn was a neck j
in front of Mml line. Imp was a hot fa- I
vorite for the first special, even money
being laid against her at post time, and
she won easily. Results:

to-day's racing at Hawthorne was the |
disqualification of Mocorito after he had i
won the second race In a rattling finish j
with Pacemaker. It was discovered that j
Mocorito carried six pounds less than

SAN TOMAS
IS WINNER OF
THE FUTURITY
Crack Two-Year-Old of the Burns
& Waterhouse Stable Comes
In at Sacramento Track.
SACRAMENTO. Sept. 12.â 1t was Gran
gers' day at Agricultural Park this after
noon and the visitors from the rural dis
tricts were among the early comers to the
track. Long before the gates were
opened the price of gold bricks had taken
an upward tendency, but the market was
dull with little doing. The patrons of
husbandry were attentive lookers-on, but
speculated little. The weather was warm
as usual and mosqirito-net clothing is still
in much demand.
Speculating on the harness events was
uncertain as usual. Dolly D won the 2:19
trot and it was hard telling whether or
not 3he was favorite. Dlawood at remu
nerative odds won the 2:12 class pace.
In the running events the talent fared
better, three choices scoring.
The rich Futurity stake for two-year
olds of the running division was the stel
lar event of the programme. Just a year
ago the stable of Burns & Waterhouse
carried off the prize with Bonibel, and
to-day repeated the turn with San Tomas,
a son of Imp. Brutus and Deception. The
winner, coupled in the betting with Bee
Bee, ruled odds on choice, the only other
starters being The Echo and Constella
tor. Bee Bee, with Charley Thorpe up.
could have won hands down, but was
! eased up at the finish to permit her stable
: companion to earn the laurels. The Echo
seemed possessed of no speed whatever
I and Constellator looked outclassed.
The 2:19 class trot, first decided, was
i captured by Dolly D. the Santa Rosa
j stock farm representative. In the open
ing heat the mare, a 1 second choice in the
betting, ended up in third position, owing
to a disastrous break early in the game.
Thereafter the daughter of Sidney Dillon
seemed to have her field at her mercy,
for she won hands clown. Athavls, han
dled by Dan Mizner, took the first heat
at odds of 8 to 1, thus cinching second
money. Twilight, guided by Dick Havey,
won third money.
Hoppled, distrusted and disgraced in
his last time out, Dlawood, a son of Di
ablo, downed his field like breaking sticks
in the 2:12 class pace. The books, not
[ noted for generosity, laid 8 to 1 against
the pacer for the opening heat, which he
i won easily from the favorite, Don. Beach
wood was also out for a "killing," but
after leading to the paddock stopped to
a walk. The latter was really the "good
thing" of the afternoon. In the second
heat Arthur W came from the bunch
with a fine turn of speed, but Diawood
developed no backing up propensities, |
taking the second heat and race from Ar
thur quite as easily as the first In 2:11. ,
I 1 this heat I Direct made a game effort,
finishing third, and with more racing luck ,
would have been a hardy contender at â 
' the end. It was perhaps fortunate for the j
winner that the conditions of the race |
did not call for heats three In five.
After the Futurity had been decided, a
seven furlong sprint, for which Manzanilla j
closed favorite, was called. Thorpe, who !
had the mount, rode one of his old-time â 
finishes, getting the verdict at the wire i
I by a short head from Meadow Lark, with
Mor?e up.
The three-cornered owners handicap,
with Libertine, Hohenzollern and Mount
McGregor as starters, was no doubt the
fiercest betting feature of the day. Mc-
Gregor, with Thorpe up, had the call, and
his superb saddle work undoubtedly won.
Assuming the '.cad almost from the jump,
he was hard pressed at the wire, but the
bay with roan markings hung on gamely,
heating Hohenzollern out over two
i lengths in 1:47*4. Had Morse on . the
latter, been given a whip the result
might have been different. Jack Ward,
astride Libertine, searched for all the
I pockets and found them. He . should re
turn to exercising again. . .-â¢
The final seven furlong dash, with a
! cheap band of platers lining up, went to
I Snips, a 5 to 1 shot, piloted by Mounce.
j Magnus, the 6 to 5 favorite, with Butler
; up ran third, beaten by Tenrica.

Corinthians have been the holders
since 1897, with ex-Commodore J. \V.

Truant measured slightly over twenty
nine feet in racing length, and so would
not have been ellgfble as a defender of the
| cup. the extreme permissible length of
! the defending boat being 25.05 feet, or 10
! per cent greater than the racing length
! of the challenger, the Gadder, of the San
j Francisco Yacht Club. In order to reduce
I her water-line length the Tj-uant has been
! lightened, considerably and in the heavy
: weather that prevailed during the regatta
jof September 9 she seemed somewhat
tender. But it may be expected that the
i winds will be lighter on September 23,

SILENT TOAST
IN MEMORY OF
HARRY EMERIC
San Francisco Flycasting Club
Listen to a Eulogy by Fish
Commissioner Vogelsang.
The members of San Francisco Flyeast
ing Club drank a silent toast to the mem
ory of Harry F. Emeric at their meeting
last night. Prior to this touching cere
mony the scene was an Impressive one
as the members listened intently to a
gracefully worded eulogy pronounced by
Fish Commissioner Vogelsang on the man
â¢who is 6aid to have done more in his
lifetime for fish and game interests in
California than any other individual. The
toast was drunk standing.
Archie J. Treat presented a series of
views of the trouting streams of the Lak.j
Tahoe and Glen Alpine district. They
seemed in effect to take the anglers iroiti
the wind swept streets of the city into
the mountains they all know so well.
With the aid of a stereopticon. operate â <!

their quest for the splendid trout wnlcn
is there in abundance. t
The majority of the views were from
photographs by Mr. Treat and showed the
most artistic bits of mountain scenery.
Mr Treat adds the accomplishment of an
gler to that of photographer and handled
his subject from the standpoint of the
former. He gave a clever running de
scription of the views, taking pains to
compliment the mc-mbers of the State
Fish Commission for the good work they
have done in storking the streams. TJjose

ALMOST RUN DOWN
THE YACHT SHAMROCK
Sir Thomas Lipton's Challenger
Nearly Fouled by a Scow That
Drifted in the Wind.
NEW YORK, Sept. 12.â Great peril be
set the Shamrock yesterday afternoon and
evening at the height of the easterly gale.
The scow Ulster, with the spare spars of
the challenger, dragged her anchor, and
was only prevented from drifting down
upon the yacht by the heroic efforts of
the combined crews of the Llpton fleet.
Three attempts were made by the men of
one of the launches before success
crowned their efforts. With heavy lines
fast the barge was slowly towed from her
dangerous proximity to the yacht. Then
lines were thrown to the Shamrock, and
with one around her steel mast near the
deck and another to her mooring buoy she
was dragged to a position of safety.
The Shamrock's topmast, which had
been housed, was sent up. Then the new
main sail was bent and when it was in
place it was readily seen what Sir Thomas
Lipton meant when he said he had sur
prises in store for American yachtsmen.
It is crosscut fashioned, after the biL?
sails turned out by the Herreshoffs. There
were a few rough places about it in need
of an hov.r or two of stretching.
The new boom was variously estimate'!
to be from 110 to 112 feet long, and the
metal gaff at from 69 to 71 feet. All in
all, the new sail is formidable, and. in the
words of naval experts, "lays all over
the Columbia's biggest in size."
Later in the afternoon the new club top
sail was sent up. Its size is also pro
digious. In fact, it is in reality a sky
scraping topsail and Its area is such as to
make all ordinary topsails look modest.

Over Eleven Thou
sand Quartered.
The records of the Presidio for yes
terday morning show that 11,553 men
are quartered within its boundaries â
enough to make an army. There were 330
recruits, 40 casuals, 57 in the regular gar
rison, approximately 5256 volunteer infan
try on the way to the Philippines and ap
proximately 5000 more returned from the
islands ar.d awaiting muster out.
In all this number there is but one case
of typhoid fever, and there is no case of
contagious disease that has been contract
ed in the camps. Every case now in the
hospital has en brought in with the
troops. The percentage of sick in the
camps shows a higher health average
than the city, while the death rate is far
below anything the city can bring for
ward. The sanitary arrangements of the
camps have not been equaled in the mili
tary history of the country, but it has
cost a great deal of money. As they now
stand the camps at the Presidio have cost
the Government $150,000, but there has been
no loss of life teat could have been pre
vented, and the investment was a g<x>d
one. Returning volunteers speaJk of the
camp as "home," when compared to those
in Manila, and they are pretty near being
correct.
Governor Lind of Minnesota spent the
afternoon at the Presidio. The $10 due
each man from the State was paid, and
tnen the regiment was formed In line and
was inspected by the Governor, and after
ward the men marched in review before
him.
To-morrow General Shaffer and his
staff will proceed to Sacramento to be
present -: "Governor's day" at the
State Fair. It is expected that Admiral
Kautz and his staff will also be of the
party. It will be a strictly full dress
affair, and the two dignitaries with the
accompanying officers will be given a
special Pullman.
To-day is the time set for the enter
tainment of the Minnesota. Regiment by
the men from California. While out in
Manila the Minnesota Regiment had the
California men over to a Thanksgiving
dinner, and the home boys have never
forgotten the time they had. The affair

they then received, and efforts will be

All the officers of the South Dakota Regiment save those under arrest
congregated at the depot to welcome their executive and accompanied him to
his hotel, where the excellent breakfast which had been prepared for him was
discussed with a gusto furnished by long travel on the part of the Governor
and long deprivation on the part of the officers who sat down to the table with
him.
After breakfast the Governor retired to his apartment?, where he had a long
conference with Colonel Frost, supposedly concerning the troubles that exist
between the commanding officer of the Daicota boys and some of his subor

Wong Hing. a San Jose murderer and
highbinder, took three shots at a couple
of coolie brethren yesterday afternoon
and narrowly escaped killing one of them,
>; at the same time hitting an inoffensive
workingman. who was seated in a store
in the neighborhood. The shooting took
* place on Spofford alley, between Clay and
" Washington streets, and grew out of the
> recent abduction of a Chinese woman
> from Waverly place.
About six weeks ago Wong Hing shot
' and killed Lee On? Poon in San Jose and
Â» also wounded Deputy Sheriff Mackey. who
attempted to arrest him. The trouble at
that time arose from a dispute over a
' woman who had been abducted from this
âº, city. Since the time of the murder, the
whereabouts of Hing has be^n unknown
' to the officers, and yesterday Deputy
s Sheriff Mackey brought two Chinamen.

they might make a search of Chinatown

> About 3 o'clock yesterday afternoon the
Chinamen were passing down Spofford

Miss Charlotte Beckwith, although not
playing exactly a prominent part, should
be encouraged. She has a natural dra

and if she would study more the art of
bringing her voice forward instead of
keeping it back there cannot be any doubt
that her success as an operatic singer
would be a great one.
Orchestra and chorus added luster to
the performance ar.d the bass solo in the

of Trade to assist in the matter of mak
ing a collection of the products of Cali
fornia that would excel anything that had
ever been placed before the public. Man
ager J. A. Filcher and his corps of assist
ants, at the instance of the directors, s^t
to work, and now the exhibit is well un
der way, but much still remains to be
done. So far the exhibits consist of fruit,
cereals and agricultural products.
Within the last few .lays the protests
of all civilized nations have gone up
against the verdict pronounced against
Captain Dreyfus of th<= French army, and
not a few of the influential bodies of
Europe and America have suggested that
the best way to express their contempt
power where such injustice
is to boycott the Paris exposition.
At the meeting of the board yesterday it
wws decided to wait until the State Leg
islature should take action. As a fact
the State Board of Tradr- stands as an
employe of the State Par-.s i 'ommission.
and has no say in what shall b*> done. Th>
collecting of the exhibits will go on until
the commission mentioned sriv-s the ord-'r
to stop. Should this order be given it is
likely that the fine exhibit already col
iP^r.^V', will be senr to thf> big national ex
position to be held in Buffalo. N. Y.

COLONEL O. F. LONG
HONORED BY COMRADES
ARMY AND NAVY UNION GAR
RISON NAMED AFTER HIM.
Ths Occasion Is Celebrated by a Re
cÂ«ption to the Popular Quarter
master of the Transport
Service.
Colonel Oscar F. Long of the United
States transport service was tendered a
splendid reception Ljy the garrison of the
Army and Navy which bears his name.
The garrison was formerly known as Cal
ifornia No. 101. but in honor of the many
courtesies extended to its members, and
by reason of his exceeding popularity as
a gentleman and a soldier, the name was
changed to the Colonel O. F. Long Garri
son.
The reception took place in the banquet
hall in the Alcazar building, and over 200
of his comrades gathered to do him
honor. These Included the members of
the garrison, delegations from the lowa
and iCarblebead and volunteers from the
various regiments now at the Presidio.
Commander J. F. Fitzgerald introduced
the guest of the evening In an appropriate
speech, and Colonel Long responded by
expressing his sincere appreciation of the
honor conferred on him. He also referred
to the co-operation of the Army and Navy
Union with the transport service, which
had dene much to bring it to its present
high state of efficiency.
speeches were also delivered by Captain
D. T. Geary of the heavy artillery. Past
Commander Frank Wisker. Honorary
Paymaster M. Remensperger, Captains n.
P. Batchelder and John Barnason of the
transport service, Quartermaster J. A.
Lansanderfer, Vice Commodore R. L.
peverell and Garrrison Inspector William
Gross.
The evening- was enjoyably spent in re
counting Incidents of the late and pres
ent wars. There were selections by the j
Third Artillery band and vocal selections ;
by several of the guests, and the enter
tainment concluded with three hearty
cheers for Colonel Long.
TROUBLE ON BOARD
TROOPSHIP PUEBLA
Negro Soldiers Accused of Cheating
at Craps Attacked by the
White Men.
HONOLULU. Sept. s.â Eighty-seven ne
gro soldiers on the transport City of
Puebla. which -rived from San Francisco
this morning, had a few moments of great
excitement and terror last Thursday in
mid-ocean. A quarrel arose between the
whites and the blacks, and only the timely
intervention of a provost guard prevented
a fight that would have ended badly for
th- colored troops.
The trouble arose over "shooting craps."
The negroes were accused of cheating
and stealing and soon a good deal of feel
ing was shown. Last Thursday morning
matters reached a climax. Several white
rs claimed to have been robbed
during the night and accused several of
the coiortd men of the robbery. The ne
groes stood by one another ar.d collected
together in the bow of the boat, ready
for an attack. Before the white men had
time to make an advance Captain Devere
learned of the situation. He sent a pro
vost guard to the scene and the guard
held the factions at bay. For the rest of
the trip the negroes kept together in the
bow and there was no more trouble.
COUGHRAN WILL BE
CHARGED WITH PERJURY
Mrs. Charles Smyth Will Swear to a
Warrant for His Arrest.
SAX RAFAEL. Sept. 12.â At the insti
â  M .ehran. a local bill collec
tor. Arthur Scott swore to a complaint to
day charging Attorney Charles Smyth of
San Francisco with obtaining money un
der false prtenses. It was alleged that
Smyth had drawn a worthless check on
the Columbian Bank for $15. Scott be
came convinced to-night that Coughran
had made of him a tool with which to
vent spite on an enemy, and had the case
dismissed after Mrs. Smyth had paid the
amount of the check before the warrant
could be served.
"In the guise of a friend this man
Coughran has been secretly hounding my
husband for months," said Mrs. Smyth
this evening. "He Is the correspondent for
an evening paper and has used its col
umns to grind his ax in a shameful man
ner. Coughran swore a short time ag >
he had served papers on me that were
never served, and after consulting with
my husband to-morrow. I intend to have
him arrested on a charge of perjury."

THE ANTI-TRUST CONVENTION.
GOVERNOR SAVERS of Texas, who issued
the invitation to the Governors and Attorneys j
General of the various States and Territories
to attend a convention in St. Louis for the purpose
of devising uniform legislation for the suppression of
trusts, is reported to be well pleased with the sup
port given to the movement. If such be the case the
Governor is easily pleased, for while the invitation
was sent out months ago and the time for holding
the 'convention is drawing near, the Governors of but
eleven States besides his own, and but seven Attorneys
General,' have promised to attend. It is true that ten
other Governors have expressed a willingness to be
present it their duties permit, but such expressions
are hardly more than polite methods of declining the
invitation. The convention therefore will fall a long
way short of representing all the States of the Union.
It is notable, moreover, that the Governors who
have promised to attend are nearly all of them
Democrats. The only Republicans of note among j
them are Pingree of Michigan and Tanner of Illinois, j
and neither of these is a representative of genuine
Republicanism. Pingree is something of a political
freak, having almost as many vagaries as a Popu- j
list and being a confirmed believer in many of the
doctrines of state socialism. Tanner is not much (
wiser, and certainly does not represent the conser
vative common sense of his State or of his party.
When the convention assembles it will find itself j
handicapped at the start, for the Governors and At- j
torneys General of twelve States and one or two
Territories cannot take action or adopt any policy <
that will be binding upon all the States. The meet- !
ing will hardly do more than give utterance to the
vague discontents existing among a considerable j
portion of the people concerning trusts. It may pos- :
sibly adopt a set of very strongly worded resolutions,
hut strong words will not stop the organization of
trusts nor even lead to any comprehensive legislation |
against them.
The futility of the proposed convention is inevit- '
a' -2 because of the lack at this time of sufficient ex
perience with trusts to determine wherein they are
good and wherein they are harmful. Until the true j
nature and the full, extent of the problems are known j
it will not be possible to determine even whether such
evils as exist can be best remedied by State legisla- :
tion or by action of the National Government.
At the recent meeting of the American Bar Asso
ciation Edward Q. Keasbey read a paper on "New !
Jersey and the Great Corporations," in the course of j
which he dealt with some of the evils of the huge .
trusts and combinations which have been lately in- !
corporated in that State. He pointed out that be- I
tween January I and August i of this year there have
been organized in New Jersey alone 1,336 corpora- j
tions having an authorized capital of over two thou- |
sand millions of dollars. After giving a strong ,
presentation of the evil of such combinations, many i
of which arc hardly more than huge gambling !
schemes, Mr. Keasbey virtually admitted that he did i
not know how the evil could be remedied.
The issue is one that must be dealt with in the near
future, but no safe guidance can be expected from an
anti-trust convention called by men who are preju- I
diced at the start and who meet with the avowed ob- j
ject of suppressing trusts altogether. From the Civic '
Federation Conference on the subject, to be held in j
Chicago, much good may be expected, but from the I
St. Louis meeting of a few Governors, most of whom i
are hardly more' than second rate politicians, it is i
not likely that anything will result of benefit to the i
country.
The massacre of the French mission by the savage j
African tribe of Tuaregs is rather convincing cvi- â 
dence that it takes more than a scratch of a pen now- !
adays for even the great powers to convert reluctant i
people to their way of thinking. The Tuaregs be- |
lieve, even if they are savage, that they have one or I
two privileges left.
Â«
It was entirely unnecessary for the New York cor
respondent that sent out the dispatch announcing the
loss of Lieutenant Peary's toes to add that the ex
plorer intended to proceed on a new basis.
Four hay cutters held up a train the other day in
Arizona. They are likely now to change their oc
cupation to hemp stretchers.
School Director Kemp admits that he ought to be
kicked. There is not a doubt about â and not for
his honesty, either. ,
THE SAW FRANCISCO CALL,, WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 13, 1899.
AN ISSUE OF FACT.
WE recently admonished the Portland Oregonian
that it was wronging itself by imagining vain
things about the Philippine situation. It is a
J very able paper and is not under the necessity of
! doing things in a sm^ll way. It chooses to advocate
imperialism and to submit reasons for our Philippine
policy which have no existence in fact, and to argue
from them as its premise.
Replying, that able paper says that The Call said:
i "The Filipinos had already conquered all of Luzon
! outside of Manila when the Americans appeared.
1 This, even if true, would be no answer to the Ore
| gonian's statement. Bandits, indeed, were largely in
control of the country outside Manila; but Aguin
j aldo, aware that national independence was hope
less, had sold out to the Spaniards for a heavy sum
and left the country, and Spain was increasing her
preparations to crush the bandits when the Americans
appeared."
We must again admonish the Oregonian that mis
icpresentation of what The Call said is an impro
priety that requires an apology, that a gen"r;.l
misrepresentation of the facts is a wrong policy,
which it should not pursue. We did not say that the
Filipinos hjid conquered Luzon outside of Manila
when the American? appeared. The facts, as we
stated them, arc historical, and we quoted one of
' Devvey's officers in their support.
The Filipino insurrection against Spain was ter
minated by a solemn treaty, in which Spain agreed to
ray an indemnity to Aguinaldq of $800,000 and to in
stitute the reforms in administration which the na
tives demanded. In his report to the State Depart
ment our Consul. Wildman, at Hongkong, says:
"There has been a systematic attempt to blacken the
name of Aguinaldo and his Cabinet on account of
the terms of their surrender to the Spanish. It has
been said that they sold their country for gold, but
this is conclusively disproved, not only by their own
1 statements but by the speech of the latt Governor
; General Rivera, in the Spanish Senate, Tune v, 1808.
He said that Aguinaldo undertook to submit if the
Spanish Government would give a certain sum to the
i widows and orphans of the insurgents. Rivera then
admits that only a part of the sum was given to
Aguinaldo, and that he (Rivera) did not find it ex
pedient to keep the other promises made."
Artacho, a follower of Aguinaldo, desired to divide
this money between the native leaders, but it is in
evidence that Aguinaldo refused, saying it was a trust
fund for his country and should be used to renew the
1 insurrection if Spain failed to keep the treaty and
institute the reforms which it promised. She did
fail, as Rivera admitted. The moment armed resis
tance ceased she violated her solemn promise.
Wildman's report continues that he opened nego
tiations with Aguinaldo's Cabinet after consultation
with Admiral Dewey, and that Aguinaldo was in
Singapore, where Consul Pratt was negotiating with
! Admiral Dewey for his return to Luzon. Wildman
i-ent him to Cavite on the McCulloch May 16. 189 S.
Wildman then says: "Immediately on the arrival of
Aguinaldo at Cavite he issued a proclamation, which
I had outlined for him before he left, forbidding pil
lage and making it a criminal offense to maltreat
â  neutrals. He of course organized a government of
which, he .was dictator, an absolutely necessary step if
he hoped to maintain control over the natives, and
from that date until the present time he has been
uninterruptedly successful in the field and dignified
and just at the head of his government. The insur
gents are fighting from freedom from Spanish rule
and rely on the well known sense of justice that con
trols all the actions of our Government as to their
future."
Following events in their chronological order, our
next witness is that ardent imperialist, ex-Minister
John Barrett, appointed to Siam from Oregon. In
I an address at Shanghai, China, last January, Mr. Bar
rett said: "I saw Aguinaldo put aboard a United
States dispatch boat in Hongkong harbor last May,
: by permission of Admiral Dewey and Consul General
i Wildman, for the direct purpose of going to Cavite
\ to organize an army and a temporary government to

â  nothing, which he has developed into a force of 30,000

: troubled with a country campaign. Moreover, he has
organized a government which has practically been

1 the American occupation of Manila, which was cer
; tainly better than the former (Spanish) administra
tion."
One of Dewey's officers, writing from Iloilo, says:
"Aguinaldo reached Cavite May 20. 1808, at which
! time there was no evidence, that we knew of, of x
; native organization. He created an army in a short
[time and immediately commenced to win victories.
j These were to us at the time astonishing, for he de
feated detachment after detachment of the Spanish.
â¢ army, took fort after fort, captured regiments with
i arms and ammunition, and in a few months had cap
j tured every Spanish soldier in the island of Luzon
jor had driven those not captured into Manila. Time
and again I have witnessed whole battalions of Span
' ish soldiers marched as prisoners into San Roquc.
Before August 13. 1808, these insurgents had actually
; captured the whole of Luzon, except Manila and
I Cavite. After taking all of Luzon, with the excep-
I tions named, they conquered the Spanish in the isl
ands of Negros and Cebu, and before we reached Iloilo
I they had this city and the whole island of Panay on
j which it is situated. Besides these there are hundreds
of smaller islands which are under the authority of
Aguinaldo's government at Malolos. More remark
: able to me than Aguinaldo's military actions has been
; the civil organization which he has perfected through
j out these islands, which now governs and rules them
' except in Manila nnd Cavite."
These, in their order, are the facts of history. We
i have named our witnesses and given their testimony.
I From it the fact is incontestably establ'-'hed that
Aguinaldo did not "sell out" to Spain; tha. .iis peo
! pie were not bandits; that he held $400,000 in trust
for his countrymen; that Spain violated her treaty
with him; that Consul Pratt went to seek him in
j Singapore, and. after negotiating with Wildman and
< Dewey. arranged for him to turn back to Cavite; that
Wildman wrote his proclamation by which his gov
! eminent was established and his army raised to co-
I operate against Spain with ours: that "the direct
J purpose" of his return, as arranged with Dewey and
the Consuls, was the organization of the government
which he formed, and that he, with his army, cap
tured, conquered and possessed the four islands of
Luzon, Cebu, Negros and Panay. except Manila and
Cavite, and that the surrender of Spanish sovereignty
over them was to him and not to us, and that under
the laws of nations and the laws of war his govern
ment and not Spain was the sovereign power there
when we bought his people of Spain for two dollars
a head. Yet, the Oregonian says: "In fighting qual
ity and all other qualities they (the Filipinos) are far
below our original North American Indians." But
i Consul General Wildman says officially: "In con
clusion I wish to put myself on record as stating that
the insurgent government of the Philippine Islands
cannot be dealt with as though they were North
American Indians willing to be removed from one
reservation to another at the whim of their masters.
Now will the Oregonian please to call its witnesses
and quote their testimony?
If there is anything in the Dreyfus case that
reaches the sublime it is perhaps the absurdity of
suggesting a boycott upon the Paris Exposition by
the Congress of the United States. While certain
Congressmen by breeding and education have the
unqualified right of making themselves ridiculous,
they should show some toleration for their fellows.
A CHANGE IN RURAL NEW ENGLAND.
SOME years ago the abandoned farms of New
England constituted a topic which engaged the
attention of the whole country. The number
of idle farms was so large in some localities that sev
eral States went to the expense of advertising them
at public cost lor the purpose of attracting settlers
and preventing what threatened to be a widespread
decay of the rural industries of that section of the
Union.
The advertising given to the lands has had its effect
and most of them have been taken up. There are no
longer any great bargains to be had in the way of
abandoned farms, and, according to a late report on
the subject, "One may travel far through even the
remote sections of New England without finding any
large number of farms that may properly be called
deserted. * * * In one way or another the list of
abandoned farms has been greatly reduced, until in
many sections the number is not greater than would
be expected under normal conditions."
The change has not been brought about, however,
by the reoccupation of the farms by a class of genuine
farmers, nor even by people retiring from the cities to
undertake farm work. We are told some have been
bought by wealthy and fashionable people and turned
into more or less elaborate summer places. Others
have been taken up by professional men of limited
means, drawn by the prospect of obtaining a vacation
home at small expense. A good many have passed
into the hands of owners of adjoining property, who
have at last come to see that, other things being equal,
a large farm is likely to be more profitable than a
small one. Some have been acquired for the timber
they bear, and a few have been bought for speculation.
The use of the farms for summer resorts, hunting
grounds, forest reserves and speculation does not on
the face of it give much promise of upbuilding the
mrual industries of a country, but it appears, never
theless, to have had that effect. The persons who have
purchased the farms have had money enough to im
prove them, and therefore have given the neighbor
hood an appearance of thrift and prosperity which has
had the effect of stimulating the residents to improve
their farms also. Moreover, a more scientific system
of farming has been introduced by the new comers,
and the old-fashioned farmers have profited by it.
Labor-saving machinery, scientific tillage, has become
the order of the day, and the value of stock and
orchards has advanced.
Along with all that there lias been a marked change
in the social conditions of rural New England. The
farms are passing into the hands of men who instead
of tilling the soil themselves hire others to do the
work. Thus the rate of fatfn wages is rising, and the
old-fashioned farmer finds it harder than ever to make
a living. Summing up the whole situation, a writer
for the New York Post says: "That the process will
eventually give us a type of alternating town and
country life, akin to that prevailing in England, is by
no means improbable, if, indeed, such a type is not
already established. The resident farmer, on the other
hand, has but two courses open to him if he wishes to
be assured a comfortable living. He may accept the
new conditions, and become himself a landed pro
prietor and agricultural entrepreneur on the new
scale, or he may resign his independence and become
a hired man. For there is going on quietly, in our
day, a social and industrial change likely, before many
years, to give the development of the farms of New-
England into the charge of men who themselves never
swung a scythe or held a plow."
OUR MINERAL PRODUCTION.
OWING to the great variety in the units of
measurement, says the official summary
of the mineral production of the United
States for 1898, the only factor common to all min
eral products and the only means by which the com
parative totals can be expressed is the value.
Taking that common measurement, the statistics
show that since 1880 the increase in the mineral pro
duction of the United States has been from an. output
valued at $369,319,000 to one valued at $697,880,002 in
1898, or nearly 90 per cent.
It is noted that the increase has been very irregu
lar. The average during the nineteen years under
J review has been an increase of $18,000,000 annually,
but from 1894 to 1895 the increase was nearly $100,
--000.000, while in the following year it was but little
more than $1,000,000. In the two years from 1892 to
1894 there was a decrease of over $121,000,000. From
1896 to 1897 the increase was about $8,000,000, while
from 1897 to 1808 it was $66,970,534. The output
of 1898 was the largest in our history, exceeding that
of 1892, the next largest, by nearly $50,000,000.
All the metals made large gains except nickel.
Copper, lead, zinc, aluminum and antimony reached
their maximum both in quantity and in value, but it is
notable that while the amount of pigiron produced
in' 1898 was greater than in any other year, yet the
value of the product was considerably less than in
1890 or 1892, though it increased $21,434,701 over the
value of the output of 1897.
The non-metallic products increased during the
year from $327,710,066 to $352,783,872, a gain of $25,
--072,906. The largest contributor to the gain was
bituminous coal, which increased from $119,567,224 in
1897 to $132,586,313 in 1898. The value of the out
i put of anthracite coal, on the 0 *ier hand, fell off
nearly $4,000,000. The other non-metallic products
showing important gains were stone, petroleum, nat
ural gas and mineral writers.
In the summary given of the output and value of
the precious metals it is noted the gold product con
tinued to increase, and in 1898 was valued at $64,463,
--000, as compared with $57,363,000 in 1897. In 1896
it was $53,088,000. The coining value of the silver
product in 189S was $70,384,485, while the commercial
value was but $32,118,420. In 1897 the coining value
was $60,637,172 and the commercial value $32,316,000.
This is an increase for the year of $747,313 in the
coining value and a decrease of $197,580 in the com
mercial value. The quantity of the production in
creased from 53,860,000 ounces in 1897 to 54.438.000
ounces in 1898. In 1806 the product was 58,834,800
ounces.
A cablegram from Marseilles contains the informa
tion that extensive fires are raging in that vicinity, at
least ten miles of forest being ablaze. If there is any
country on earth that seems just now to need puri
fication by fire it is France.

HERE is a coin-moving problem which can be introduced at any gathering
you may attend. A piece of paper with twenty squares marked on it will
do, care being taken to have the heavy marks in the right place. The idea
Is to get the nickels over to the penny side and the pennies to the nickel
side in the fewest moves possible.
Each move forwards two coins of the same kind, but each coin must move but
one space. The barriers, indicated by the heavy lines, cannot be crossed. Start
at either side. The numbers are used to define the spaces. As there are so many
ways of starting and moving, it will not be necessary to explain how your result
was reached. There is, however, a lower limit than some will discover.
UNHAPPY WIVES SEEK
FREEDOM IN DIVORCE
LYMAN I. MOWRY IS CHARGED
WITH CRUELTY.
Mrs. Emma Stierlen Accuses Her
Husband of Unfaithfulness and
Names Rose Scott as Co-
Respondent.
Elizabeth R. Mowry filed suit yesterday
against her husband, Lyraan I. Mowry,
the well-known attorney, for a divorce.
Cruelty la alleged as ground of action.
In her complaint Mrs. Mowry states
that she married her husband November
2, 18S7. As specific instances of cruelty
she alleges that notwithstanding that
she is a singer and has a tender
throat her husband insisted on smok
ing in the house. WVille they were
living at 316 Haight street, at 1719 Oak
and at the Berkshire, she says, he fre
quently remained out late at night, and
when expostulated with would use un
seemly epithets and threaten to kick
down the door. Her suffering was all
mental, she. admits, but sufficient to war
rant her a decree as prayed for.
Mrs. Emma Stierlen, the wife of George
Stterlen, a capitalist well known in this
city and Los Angeles, also filed suit
against her husband for divorce. She
alleges desertion and infidelity, naming
Rose Scott of Los Angeles as co
j respondent. Mrs. Stierlen alleges that her
husband is now living with Rose Scott
! and refuses to give any attention to her
pleas for aid. Hence she asks for a divi
sion of the community property, valued
at about ?50,000, and for $250 a month ali
mony.

AMUSEMENT
IN VARIETY AT
THE ORPHEUM
SINCE the advent of the American
Biograph at the Orpheum about
everybody stays to the end of the
programme, and they all feel glad
they do at the finish. If any particular
subject happens to be dull it is forgotten
in the interest of the others. The pic
tures seem to be the outcome of keen ob
servation and well chosen opportunity.
The attention of the most unappreciative
every-day mind is closely held and re
warded.
Of the new people. White and Harris,
the singing and dancing duo, were par
ticularly interesting to me up to a cer
tain point. The young woman sings
"My Ann Eliza" with such a rush of
spirits and dances with an abandon and
exuberance that leaves me Quite minus a
descriptive adjective. I never saw the
like. She reappears after her first exit
gowned like an inverted French poppy,
is never still a moment and never out of
breath. The other member of the team
puts in a few "falls" with her sixteen
summt-rs to the infinite amusement of the
onlooker, and does other rational things
very cleverly. T'ntil they begin their
burlesque acrobatic work they are ex
cellent. After that their act is just a lit
tle silly, but the orchestra plays so in
cessantly and steadily that you can't
think and you don't realize it until later.
It is like having a tooth extracted with
out pain. "Is he good afterwards?" said
young America at my right when Charley
Case was singing his first song. It was a
brutal question, but since he wasâ and
very goodâ it doesn't matter. He has a
little patent for humor all his ownâ an
after explanation of facts in themselves
simple and without interest. It takes a
deal of quiet thought to make such
things effective, and I don't believe he
has many idle hours. His song about
the press being represented everywhere
might be added to Indefinitely without
danger of wearying.
I wonder if Montrell ever handles
things rationally. I should hate to invite
him to dinner. He might take a notion to
juggle with the glassware and small
plates, and it would be an awful example
fo.r the. children. His spinning firebrands
are more beautiful at second view than
at first and his apparent lack of clever
intention half the battle of his success. It
seems a fitting close to tlie little chil
dren's engagement that they should sing
"Dinah." San Francisco first fell in love
with Arnold at the Tivoli in just that
song and Hazel makes a most effective
Dinah. They are both such. fresh looking
stage children. They seem to have just
wandered out from the cool and quiet of
a nursery and they both look thoroughly
happy. The Crawford sisters are quite
picturesque enough to be interesting, but
they have hardly force or experience
enough to be convincing and they should
not do coon songs. Coon songs are not
for all people. Their jockey dance was
very graceful and very clever and with
singular discretion they put it last, leav
ing a pleasant impression upon the audi
ence. The boys' band plays better this
week than last. Suppe's "Light Cavalry"
and the Strauss waltzes won well-deserv
ed encores. "The Bachelor Club Quartet"
finds favor chiefly through their songs.
They seem to me sort of prophets of a
new day. If some one will take their idea
and build upon it, he will make one of the
very best vaudeville attractions of the
future and find the amusement lover hun
gry for novelty rising up to call him
blessed. Finally, if I could not go to the
Orpheum once a week I should be much
hipped and out of humor.

SINGULAR CHANGE IN
NATIONAL GUARD LAW
NOVEL INTERPRETATION OS
THE WORD "CONSECUTIVE."
; To Be Out Ninety Bays Is to Be Con
sidered Faithful Consecutive
Service â Resignation Ac
cepted.
General orders No. 8, issued a short time I
since from superior headquarters, of |
which the following is an extract, have i
been the subject of considerable comment
in National Guard circles:
Former members of the National Guard who
have been honorably discharged for "expira- ]
tion of term of service" or on account of |
"removal" and have returned to the limits |
of their commands, and officers who have re
signed, been honorably discharged, or whose I
terms have expired, who re-enlist or re-enter
the guard within ninety days of the date of
their discharge or the expiration of the term
I of office, will be given credit for continuous
| service and the enlistment will be considered
consecutive.
This is an amendment of paragraph 360 [
of "The Rules and Regulations" govern
ing *he National Guard of this State.
Section 1941 of the Political Code says:
The commander In chief is authorized and j
< has power to establish and prescribe such I
rules and regulations, forms and precedents
! not inconsistent with the provisions of the
codes, as he may deem proper for the use,
government and instruction of the National
Guard, and to carry Into full effect the pro- !
visions of the codes relative thereto.
In section 1936 of the same code the- - e
is:
All officers, non-commlssloned officers and |
privates who have faithfully served in the (
| military service of this State for the -space I
' of seven consecutive years, and received the
: certificate of the adjutant general certif'-ing |
the same, are thereafter exempted from further
military and Jury duty except In time of v.-..r.
According to the code it must appear ;
' that there has been seven consecutive i
| years of faithful service before an officer, I
j non-commissioned officer or a private can [
> obtain a certificate of exemption. All tlu>
i authorities agree as to the meaning of !
! the word "consecutive," and the deflni- i
! tloris of that word are: "Following in a |
; train, succeeding one another in regular
order, successive, uninterrupted in course
or succession." The amendment places a
new construction on the word by saying ;
that a break of ninety days, during which
period the individual is in no way con
nected with the guard, is "continuous ser- j
vice," providing, of course, that at any <
time within those ninety days the honora- I
bly discharged individual shall re-enlist or j
n-.-entt-r the guard.
It is claimed that if there is authority j
to grant a leave of ninety days the tims i
can be extended to years. A man once dis
charged from the service of the State sev- ;
ers his connection therewith absolutely j
and the force of this is recognized in gen
eral orders. In which is:
"A man once discharged from the Na- \
tional Guard can become a member again
oniy by enlistment or commission as pro- j
\ :dad by law."
Certain rewards or privileges are often
allow* d in the United States army for re- :
enluiment, but whatever they are Is dis
tinctly stated in the law governing the ac- !
tion. 'such as section 12SU of the Revised j
Statutes of the United States, and other
sections, but there is nothing in the law '
governing the National Guard of Califor- j
n'a that gives power to any one to de- !
clare that any honorably discharged sol
flier who has been out of the guard for â 
ninety days may on the last day of that j
period re-enlist in or re-enter the guard '
and be given credit for continuous service
! from the date of his discharge.
I The purpose of this change is not under- ;
stood, unless it is to give any individual, I
who leels so inclined, an opportunity to !
serve, two or three days after enlistment, :
"remove" and be honorably discharged, j
| and then at the end of ninety days re-en- |
list, "remove" and continue re-enlisting i
and 'removing" until he has served "sev- '
en consecutive years faithfully" and
obtain his certificate of exemption with
out doing any military duty.
Brigadier-General Warfield has been
franted leave of absence for forty-five !
ays, with permission to absent himself |
from the State.
The new bids for new uniforms for tiie '
guard will be opened on the 7th of Octo
ber.

The State is entitled to all the land em

many of these were found to be within
Spanish or Mexican grants which had
been confirmed and were appropriated by
the giantees or their assigns the State has
authorized locations to be made upon

TAHICMIPI-W., Ornbaun, Cal. This
department has not been able after an
extensive research to discover any reason
for the change of name of the town in
Kern County from Tahichlpi, the original
Indian name, which means "valley of the
oaks," to Tehachapi. Prior to the rail
road accident, which happened near that
point many years ago, the original name
prevailed, and it was so down in the
guide as the Postofflce name, but after
that accident the name appeared in the
papers as "Tehachapi," and that spelling
has been folio-wed ever since, it even ap
pearing so in the Postal Guide. In the
gazetteers, latest issue, the name is given
as "Tahichipi" or "Tehachapi." If any or
the readers of this department can fur
nish an explanation for the change, tne
same will be published.
PRESS COMMENTS
"Yellow Journalism" of the Journal.
New York Herald.
PARIS, Sept. 2, 1899.
To thÂ« Editor of the Herald: The letter
published in the New York Journal of
August 13 was never written, dictated or
signed by me. HTACIJJTHE
(Pere Hyaclnthe).
It was unlikely that the great French
preacher would ever see a copy of the
Journal in which the alleged communica
tion from him was printed in big type,
with flaring headlines.
But the unexpected happened. Some
friend perhaps mailed him a copy. In
some way it was brought to his notice,
and in an outburst of indignation he wrote
the above note embodied in a special cable
dispatch from Paris to this morning's
Herald.
Recently the journal against which
Pere Hyacinthe now complains published
what purported to be a dispatch from the
eminent Parisian journalist. Francis de
Pressensc. When this gentleman's atten
tion was called to it he publicly, through
the columns of the Aurore, denounced It
as a forgery.
It is quite unnecessary to make any
comment on such facts. They speak for
themselves.

Women Who Lead in Philanthropy
Sacramento Bee.
Among the Abou Ben Adhems that have
arisen among 1 the women in this country
surely Mrs. Leland Stanford and Mrs.
Phebe Heaxst lead all the rest. In ster
ling philanthropy â that philanthropy
which does good with money while the
philanthropist is alive, and does not
hoard all the treasures until death, scat
tering them when the philanthropist could
not possibly do anything elseâ it is doubt
ful if the modern world has seen any
better examples than those furnished by
these two women of California.
What Mrs. Stanford has done at the Le
land Stanford Jr. University has been
rivaled by the magnificence of the dona
tion given by Mrs. Phebe Hearst to the
State University.
Together or separately these women
furnish shining examples of a philan
thropy which is the wonder and tne
admiration of the entire civilized world
to-day.

that gives inspiration to her hu

a plane with the general grandeur of
the commonwealth.
.-iicn magnitude is the conception
of Mrs. Phebe R. Hearst which brought
forth from the best technical minds of
the world the detail and ensemble of
what purp"s>-s t" be the grandest and
most Rrtistic grouping of subsidiary
buildings into one vast institution of
learning that the workl has ever Been.
The story of the contest, which stands
without parallel in the history "f the
world, has been fully set forth in the
papers during the past few weeks, but
all word painting and pictorial repre
sentation of the ideas advanced by
world-famed architects fall far short of
giving a complete understanding of the
magnitude and artistic beauty of the
idealization of California's future uni
versity.

â photographic reproduction of the gen-
eral idea of buildings as represented by j

that the mind begins to grasp the full
meaning of the competition which Mrs.

P'ime of the most artistic bits of the
future institution of learning which
will make California world renowned.
Mrs. Hearst, whose illness prevented
1 her presence, had joined the regents
! with a special invitation to those who
! have in the past profited by the uni
j versity to inspect the designs for the
' future seat of learning and become ac
! quainted with the men who have made
the selection out of the many present
ed, and it was expected that at this
meeting she would make the announce
ment of her intention to begin the ma
terialization of the scheme which Is
â¢now in the realms of the ideal.
It has been known for some time that
Mrs. Hearst contemplated the erection
of one or more buildings for the univer
sity, but it is now made public for the
first time that this desire on her part
was the inception of the idea to have a
competition of architects to design a,
magnificent university. While she
Wished to erect a building she wanted
that building to be in harmony with the
future growth of the university. Her
selection is to be erected as a memorial
to her husband, and as he was a min
ing man her choice was naturally the
mining building. This she will begin
the erection of immediately after the
acceptance of the plans by the regents,
and following closely upon this she
will erect another as a reminder of
herself. While her selection on this
point has not yet been made public, It
is understood that it will be the
women's building.
1 It is announced that Mayor James D.
Phelan and Miss Jennie Flood will each
erect a building, and it is expected that
several other of the wealthy alumni of
the institution will show their apprecia
tion of the possibilities of the future by
assisting in the consummation of the

present ideal; and while the magnitude!
of the conception is startling at first it j
is among the probabilities that the
present generation will see what is now
apparently but a dream become a beau
teous reality.
The plans will be on exhibition at the
ferry depot until next Saturday, when
they will be formally submitted to the
regents of the university; and should
they be accepted, of which there seems
no reason to doubt, the progress from
idealization to realization of the project
will be a mere question of time and in
clination of those who are most imme
diately interested in the future of this
great State.
Millions of dollars will be required to
bring the matter to a conclusion and
years of time will elapse before the
magnificent adornment of the Berkeley
hills is complete, but from the day
that word went, over the world that
California wanted designs for the most
complete institution of learning on the
globe, the fame of the State and the
munificence of Mrs. Phebe Hearst, who
made the idea a possibility, became
world wide. The jury of architects
have served faithfully and well and
their labors have given to California,
as much as those of the successful de
signer, the plans of a university that
the world itself will be proud of.
The labors of the jury are over and
the members will soon return to their
respective homes, undoubtedly carry-
Ing with them memories of the broad
hospitality of the State which called
them together. They have been feast
ed and feted by a grateful people who
have found time amid the rejoicing
over returning sons to give honor to
those who have done so much for the
future of the youth of the common
wealth.

ARREARS OF WORK BY
THE BOARD OF REGENTS
The Regents of the University of Cali
fornia met in regular session yesterday
afternoon, General Barnes presiding.
Nothing but routine business was trans
acted, the passing of bills and acting upon
recommendations from the various com
mittees.
Just before the meeting adjourned Re
gent Budd called for a vote upon th
amendment of article 365 of th
by-laws, a change which he had propoaa
I two months before and which would make
! the regular meeting days of the Regents
; the first Tuesdays in September. Decem
-1 ber. March and June and the day before
commencement. Regent Wallace objected
i to the amendment in strong and vigorous
language, contending that the university's
needs demanded that the Regents meet at
least once a month; but the majority of
! the Regents present voted for the amend
! ment.
Kx-Presiderit Kellogg, who Is now away
| on a vacation, asked the Regents for a
leave of absence and a continuance of his
salary. Regent Hallidie championed Pro
fessor Kellogg's cause, but Regent Foote
opposed it. The matter was laid on the
table awaiting the arrival of President
Wheeler.
New changes will be .made in the gym
i nasium, which will be enlarged so as to
serve as an auditorium witn a capacity of
1200 seats. This will cost $2000. An addition
will be made to the conservatory, and a
new laboratory will be added to the chem
ical building, the improvements aggregat
i ing $10,000. ,
Considerable discussion was indulged in
over the medal fund. At present the cost
of medals Cor the highest graduating
scholar is $125. but the annual income from
the fund reaches $237 60. It being a trust
fund, the Regents were in a quandary
what to do with the surplus, and as the
matter involved some legal technicalities
it was put upon the table for future con
sideration.
Professor Rising was allowed an assist
ant at $300 a year; J. A. Rowell. library

Dried Fruit in New York.
â  York Commercial says:
"The increased interest In dried fruits con
tinues, and negotiations are in progress look-
Ins toward heavy Bales In the near future..
There is no tfiiotable change in prices, but there
ib a firmer feeling on everything except
peaches. Dealers begin to expect a revival of
business, which will partially compensate for
the dullness that has characterized trade fur
the past few weeks.
"The prune situation is improving and prices
on Santa Claras tend upward, though so far
as known no actual advance has occurred,
compared with opening prices. The decision
of the growers not to sell below a specified fig
ure holds prices at about the opening price. It
is a fact, however, that some sales have been
made as low as 2%c for outside goods, and con
siderable blocks are reported to have gone out
at 2%C Santa Claras are held firmly at 3c. j
Growers Insist upon receiving their prices, bas
ing their demands upon a reduced output In
tliis country, compared with last year, and a
shortage abroad. Movement is expected to im
prove from now on till the bulk of the crop la
disposed of.
"Raisins on the spot axe firmer, and three
crowns are up He. The old goods have been
cleant-d up by sales to Western commission
houses and a few in Eastern markets. No
prices had bÂ«#en made on new goods yesterday,
and It is said that none were expected before
September 20. It is thought that prices havo
been pretty accurately foreshadowed, and that
the stocks most in demand will sell not far from
the price given. The market will be in a very
favorable position. Last year at the opening
of the season there were fully 1000 cars
of carry-over goods. This year the association
has disposed of all its holdings, and dealers are :
not heavily stocked. As the market is guar- |
anteed against decline, there will be little
chance for cut rates. It would appear.
"Peaches are the only variety of dried fruit
which are neglected. No one wants to buy
under present conditions, and holders are
forced to urge sales to do much from first
hands. It is said that peaches have been sold
In the interior of California for 4%c, but the
ranj;e generally quued Is s%'Â§'6c. A few sell
at fi%p, but not many. There Is no uniform
system of grading, anil choice means widely
varying qualities In different growing sections.
"Apricots are nearly all out of first hands.
and i-rices re held firm on all grades. Trading
Is small at present."

this event, though sudden, was not wholly un

of nupport. Late In the day, after loans had
either been readjusted or lid 'if.', there were

. liquidation of the last two days has undoubt- !

dition of the banks. The call loan rate, after |
rising to I per cent, fell away to 6, hut this !
was only after the day's demand had been sat- ;

Chicago Grain Market.
CHICAGO. Kept. 12 -At the Immediate opon
inp in wheat yesterday's bullish Government
j crop report did not have any appreciable effect
on pries. On the contrary the market was in
clined toward weakness, the bears taking for
their cue the he.avy Northwest receipts, offering
wheat in considerable quantities. The result,
was small declines in everything. It was evl-
I dent that the Governrm-nt report, which mdii
i cattd a total crop of something like 487,000,
--| 000 bushels, was not so lightly regarded in the
j country, for outside buying orders beuan to
stream in shortly after the opening. The buy
ing was so brisk in comparison with the recent
dullness that for the time being it took the
; breath away from the professional bears and
prices shot upward with considerable rapidity.
December opened a shade lower at 71^7ivic
nnd reached 71% c. before realizing became heavy
: enough to nnnsr a temporary setback. The
tone Of the flixir gradually became decidedly
bullish, the sentiment, being strengthened by
outside buflnt. and shorts covered freely.
! Prices kept on the up grade until within thirty
; minutes of the close, with the broadest business
lln weeks. December advanced to 71 7 ,fc<3>72c.
This was well above call figures, hut no re
action of importance took place until the post
ing of Uradstreefs llgures on the world's visi
ble, Bhowlng an increase of 4.935,000 bushels.
This was far beyond what the trade antici;>at>'<l
and had an immediate effect. In the meantime
shorts had covered generally and the selling
! movement which started found little opposi
tion. Prices dropped rapidly from that time
to the close, though September was given bet
! ter support than the more distant futures. De
i cember w.-Â«s the object of a determined raid by
professional bears, and at the close all of the
! earlier advance had disappeared. December de
clined to 71@T1V, and was bringing that price
at the close. September closed with a gain of
at 70% c.
Corn was fairly active and irresrular. The
market early felt the Government report, con
siderable outside buying being done, especially
In deferred futures. Later in the day the mar
ket became weak and all the advance was lost.
December closed a shade higher and Septem
ber a shade lower.
Oats were rlrm and higher, though not
maintaining best prices. The market was
steady at the close. December closed with a
gain of %c to y*c.
Provisions were weak all day and closed at
the bottom of a substantial decline. Hog
prices were lower and yellow fever news waa
disquieting. The strength of grain markets
probably prevented a larger decline. At the
close October pork was 10 cents lower, lard 5
cents lower and rlhs 5 to 7>4 cents lower.

DEFEATED BY THE PEOPLE
Judge Troutt Enters a Second
Judgment Against the
Corporation.
Its Efforts to Evade the Payment of the War
Revenue and Shift the Burden by Virtue
of a Court Judgment Without Avail.
FOR a second time Judge Treat* has
passed adverse Judgment on Wells.
Fareo & Co. for its refusal to bear
the revenue burden Imposed upon It
by the acts of Congress. Since the
dn&ctment of the war revenue law Wells,
Farg:- &. Co. have stubbornly opposed all
efforts to compel the corporation to obey
the law and Itself furnish and bear the
expense cf revenue stamps required to be
affixed to each bill cf lading or other
manifest issued as a memorandum of re
ceipt. In each legal battle before the
lower courts it has been defeated, but
again marshaled ita forces and "def-nd
e<i" actions brought to compel compliance
with the law. Yesterday, however. Judge
Troutt handed down an opinion from
which an appeal will be taken and final
Judgment passed by the Supreme Court.
This judgment on record. Attorney flan
eral Ford stands ready to enforce It, and
for each violation of its holdings the cor
poration must defend Itself In court If not
In an action brought to compel the forfeit
ure of its franchise.
The action decided yesterday was that
of the people against the corporation on
the relationship of the Assistant Attorney
General, in which the court was prayed to
issue a peremptory writ of mandate
against the company, compelling it to af
f.x. and bear the expense of revenue
stamps as required by the war expendi
tures act. Attorney General Ford pros
ecuted the case of the people, and his ar
gument left practicaliy out one hole.
through which the company sought to
crawl tn its effort to beat the people and
the Government, to which it owes its ex
istence. The corporation lawyers con
tended that inasmuch as the act in ques
tion dM not specifically state whether or
not the company or the consignor should
bear the burden cf the revenue law as re
lates to the afnxing of stamps to bills of
iading or other manifests, the matter
should fee left to the parties in interest,
and the matter of affixing the stamp, and
its attendant expense, left to agreement
reached by argument or barter between
the shipper and the carrier. While thus
presenting its case the company neglected
to mention its superior power over the or
dinary consignor, but the court doubtless
considered that i- left to agreement be
tween the consignor and the corporation
the latter would devise ways ana means
by which to escape the burden. The money
would be raised and the purpose of the
law subserved, but. as before, the people
would again be the carrier of a shifted
burden. Hence the ccurt did not consider
the defense of the company a sufficient
one. and on motion of the Attorney Gen
eral has entered judgment In favor of the
people and against the corporation on the
pleadings.

titled a- tot to i" "la ways and anÂ« to
meet war expenditures," and approved June
13, 1338.
The question as to whether Weils. Fargro &
Co. or thÂ« consignor should cay for such a
Wtnp as aforesaid was determined by this
court list October adversely to the company in
the case of Costley V 3. Wella, Fargo & Co.. on
apceal from the Justices' Court, and a writ
ten opinion was filed.
Coatley's action was brought to recover dam
ages suffered by reason of the company's refu
sal to receive and forward a certain package as
requested by him on hi 3 offer to pay the regular
charges The ground of such refusal waa Cost
ley's failure, on demand, to provide thÂ» com
pany witc a stajnr that the act of Congress
required should be attached to the memoran
dum of receipt, to which he w&j entitled, la
event cf the acceptance cf his package for
trar.srcrration. *
The facts of the case at bar place The defend
ant ia a similar attitude to that which It as
sumed in the aforesaid Costley .rase so far as
concerns the rround or its refusal to accept
the package tendered to it by the plaintiff
herein.
Defendant now. however, very earnestly
ure-es as a new point tiat the aforesaid act of
Congress did not impose the burden of provid
ing the aforesaid stamp exclusively upon the
defendant or the consignor but left it to the
parties themselves who should bear such bur
den, acd contends, therefore, that defendant
might properly refuse to accept goods for
transportation If the consignor refused to pro
vW* or pay for the stamp.
It appears from the pleadings and it la COO
cede-i by defendant's counsel that the con
signer offered to pay In advance a reasonable
compensation to defendant for its acceptance
and transportation, of the package in question.
We find that section 13 of the aforesaid act de
clares that any person who shali Issue any in
strument, document or paper mentioned In
schedule "A" cf the aforesaid act, without the
sase being duly stamped, shall te guilty of
a misdemeanor and be punished by fir.c or Im
priacnicent or both. In the discretion of the
ccurt; and that such instrument, document or
paper not being- stamped shall be deemed In
valid and of no effect.
By schedule "A" of the act !t Is declared
that It shall be the duty of the express com
pany to issue to the person from whom any
goods are accepted f:r transportation a bill
cf lading or other memorandum cf receipt,
and that there shall be duly attached to the
sinÂ« a stamp cf the value cf one cent; and
tha: ar.y failure t~> Issue each memorandum
shall subject the company to a realty of 150.
Tr.is court has not changed irs opinion as
expressM tn writing in the aforesaid Costley
case, but assuming, as defendant claims, that
the aforeaaM sot of Co-r.yress dees act declare
whether the express company or the consignor
shall provide the afcrÂ°Â«aM starrp, still I am
Eatfsfieii that under s^tiocs 2133 and 2173 of
our Civil Code the defendant, as a common
carrier. Is obliged to a^efpt and transport
sroods under the circumstances a? they here
appear. A.- the defendant upon accep:ar.ce of
the g-Â»ds would be obli*<vi under b<~th our
statute and the aforesaid act to tsrae a rcâ¬m
cran.'.um cf receipt, it follows that to avoid the
commission of a crime it would be obliged to
attach tb* stain to the memorandum, even
at Its own cost If the consignor refused to
pay for it.

vent peaching. The fishing season has
been closed ever since the mountain fires
of two or three years ago. T^ast leason

very rapidly. Next year fishermen may
have much sport- Until a few years ago

HIS FUME OF
LOVE FLICKERED
AT SEVENTY
Hodge-Nicholl Trial
Begun.
Oak' and Office San Francisco Call.
908 Broadway. Sept. 12.
The trial of Miss Jane Hodge's $50,000
breach of promise damage suit against
her aged uncle by affinity. John Nicholl,
the rich East Oakland capitalist, was be
gun in Judge Ogdec's court this after
noon.
Little time was consumed In selecting a
Jury. Among those challenged was A.
Bernal. -who vouched that he "could not
impartially try a case where a woman
sues for breach of promise, because." as i
he put It. "the woman surely ought to be
willing to take even chances with the !
man." The following jury was accepted
and sworn: Chris A. Mulvey, C. B. Har
mon. O. C. Hyatt, M. K. Houghton. Chris
Christensen. Richard Feige. B. F. Maloon.
Conrad Reigelhuth. J. H. Fensher. C. J.
Zobei. W. B." Bridge and Charles F.
Harper.
Miss Hodge, the spinster plaintiff, who
has herself passed fifty summers, was
present with her attorneys, W. W. Foots
and Reed & Nusbaumer. She was gowned
in black, and her white tresses, her Quiet
demeanor as she gazed through her gold
rimmed spectacles, precluded even the j
slightest excuse for any hint that an ad
venturess was scheming to mulct an aged
capitalist of 50.000 glittering dollars for
her lacerated affections.
The defendant. John Nicholl. who has
but recently passed his seventy-eighth
birthday anniversary. was also on hand
with his attorneys, Major John B. Mhoon
and Sam Bell Mcl^ee. But for the perfect
white "galloways" issuing from beneath
his chin, he would pass for a man of 30
years. His face is massive-featured and j
flushed with apparent health, not at ail
Indicative of blood that lags in its clr- j
culation or has cooled of its animal heat. |
Mazie and Heasifl Nlcholls, defendant's i
two daughters, who are saW by Miss
Hodge to have caused the engagement to J
be broken, were also in court, but were j
excluded while illss Hodge testified, J
which she did after Attorney Foote had j
made i brief though comprehensive open
ing statement to the jury.
Miss Hodge first related her advent in
California in 1554, and In Oakland in ". â¢â¢'
She- had frequently met Mr. Nicholl. and j
their relations had always been pleas- |
ant. On November 9, 1888, Mr. Nicholl
had spoken to her about her need of a j
life companion. The act day they had
gone riding, when the aged capitalist
popped the question.
â¢â¢He said." continued the witness, "that
he was going to marry me, and I told i
him I was willing. He told me to go to a â 
tailor next day and get my trousseau, and
offered me money, but I wouldn't ta.-ce j
It. I told him I had not much money, and ;
he said he would marry me 'if I didn't j
have a shoe on me.' 'You're the woman |
I want.' he said, and when I asked. *'W hat i
will the girls -say? 1 he said they said they
wanted it. Yes, and he embraced me j
passionately. I afterward told Mazie
about our ensraeement. and from Novem
ber 10 to December 13 he called on me
nearly every day. Then he ceased, and j
on December 2>> I wrote him a letter .and j
again one on the 38th, wherein I asked ;
him whether he waa willing that I should j
publish our engagement." The letter was ,
here introduced by Attorney Foote. In
it plaintiff had written that "the few
days you asked me to wait before going
further In our little matter have now de
veloped into three weeks, and as you
have not called on me during that time.
folks here are beginning to wonder what
we mean to do. Is it not beat that we
show them that we are both in earnest
as to our marriage?" The letter was
signed "Lovingly your promised wife,
Jane Hodge." , .
\ttorney Foote then wished to submit
John Nicholl' - reply to the foregoing
note. Nlcholl's reply was In the hand
writing of his daughter, Mazie, and some
thing was said by Mr. Foote about ad- j
mitting that the letter had not been writ- ,
ten by'Nichoil's attorney, to which Major j
Mhoon tersely retorted: "I hope. Mr.
Foote. you will not charge me with writ
ing so impolitic a letter." Mr. Foote then j
read the letter, as follows:

recent linen -â¢--*-,- it San Pablo
I received a type-written letter bearing the
ty*Â«Â»-wrttten signature Jane Hod??. I pre
sume the letter waa from you. When I re
tu-ned home I also found one of the same na
ture Uoth letters asked me this question.
"Are you willing I should publish our engage
ment?" in. answer to this question I will say I
that I never was aware of an engagement exist- j
in* between us but a. conditional agreement
rhat if the girls trny daughters, Made and
Hassle) did not object to your coming to th*
home established by me for them at 1351
Fourth aÂ«enue as my wife we were to be mar
ried. I never had any other intention toward :
you than marriage upon these conditions, and
they were fully understood and agreed upon by j
' You Informed both Masie and Hessie at dif- |
ferent times that such was the agreement, and '
that It was your wish to conform to the agree- j
ment upon those conditions.
You fully understood what led me to talk
with you upon the subject of marriage: that â 
it was my thought to relieve my daughters
from the close attentions upon the home, and
that you might be some relief to them if an ;
agreeable alliance could be made between us. !
You told me to tnlk with the girls on the sub- i
ject and If they were agreeable and would per- '
mit you to come to their home a3 my wife wÂ» j
were to be married; If not, then the marriage
"was off."
Maz-.* and IT* Ml* considered the matter very
carefully and consciously and finally decided
to 50 and ask you to ride and talk with you.
Then they could better conclude whether It
would be possible for them to permit you to :
become a member of the household. On that
ride yon at once assailed them for infiuenclng :
me again*t you and delaying mattersâ trytg
to break up our friendship. This I now want '
to emphatically deny and disabuse your mind
of any such wrong Impression. I simply could
net carry out my Intentions toward you on the '
grounds agreed â that we were to be mar- I
ried if I could brinj you to our home with the
girls' consent.
It never was my intention to marry you and
be obliged to seek any other place of abode,
nor was It my intention to marry you and '
bring you to our home contrary to the wishes
cf my daughters, who have always made this !
their home. This you fully understood and
agreed to.
On this same afternoon you told the girls
that you could put but two construction* upon
my actions either that I Intended to marry you
or that my Intentions were dishonorable. Now
my intentions toward you were always condi
tional, as you know.
The girls decided, from the attitude you
maintained toward them, that it would be im
possible for them to receive you Into their
home.
In one of the letters you ask this question
"What shall I tell my friends?" I see no need
of your telling them anything: but If you do
tell them the conditions upon which you agreed
to marry meâ that It the girls were willing
that I should bring you home as my wife we
were to. be married; If they were not willing.
then the agreement was null and void, or.- as
you expressed it. "ft was off." Kern I hope
that you will understand that the agreement
cannot be longer entertained and that you will
hereafter meet me and my family on the old
time friendly relations. Yours very sincerely.
JOHN NICHOLL.
When Mr. Foote resumed questioning
witness and Major Mhoon made some ob
jections, creating a doubt in witness's
mind as to whether to answer or not,
Foote kindly and facetiously advised Miss
Hodge that "the major ain't ruling on the
question." but that its admisslbility lay
with Judge Ugden.
Witness then continued to relate the
fact that a week after Nicholl had popped
the question, which caused her cheeks to
burn, she. Nicholl, Mrs. R. L. Boyd and
Mrs. Berry were seated at Mrs. Boyd'3
home when witness announced the en
gagement.
Mr. Foote here asked Miss Hodge, "Can
you tell what you expended for clothing?"
and Major Mhdon vigorously objected
when Mr. Foote peacefully withdrew the
question remarking. "We are not suing
for old clothes, that's true. We are after
something higher than that."
Then the witness told of a drive with
Mazie and Hesste. "Mazie asked me
whether I was to take their ma's place,
and Hesaie asked 'who waa to do the
housekeeping.' She asked me." contin
ued the aged maiden lady, "whether I

manner that ordinarily Indicates anger, it
is only their way of "amicably discuss

R:we.
Mr. Rows made a remarkable speech
last night. Nearly ail Mr. Rowe s
speeches are remarkable. During the
heat of a friendly discussion, Mr. Rowe
expressed the hope that the newspaper
men would not --â ret their actions as
those of quarrelsome men.
â¢â This is Just a friendly discussion, a
sort of family gathering," said he. "Every
body is at liberty to express his opinion.
We don't all think alike. We don't all
express ourselves alike. But it Is all right.
We are not quarreling, and I sincerely
hope that the newspapers will not give
out the impression that every time we
differ In the Council chamber we are hav
ing a fight." 'â â  .
A.nd the ten Councilmen nresent laughed
ten different kinds of laugh.

She said 76 years and I said even If he
was 170 years old I would marry him Just
the same. : - ,
"Mazie said to me when I told her of our
engagement and asked her what she
thought of it: 'Well, it is all right, but
with me it Is a purely financial matter.'
and she asked me if I would be satisfied
with a child's portion. I only looked at
her, and said no more. I never thought
of money at all." _
Asked by Mr. Foote what effect the
breach of contract had had on her. Miss
Hodge concluded: "It has ruined me for
life. Yes. my feeitriKS have been greatly
hurt. I have been humiliated, and am
worrying all the time." And the aged
spinster wiped away a few tears that
dimmed her eyes. â  ;
Perhaps the warmest article submitted
was Miss Hodge's reply to John Nichols'
letter. Mr. Foote read its contents In a
clear, forceful manner, and the jurors
appeared to relish It as much as the spec
tators who thronged the lobby. Follow
ing is the letter:
Lester avenue. East Oakland. Jan. T, 13M.
My Dear Mr. Nicboll: Have Just received
your letter. Am very sorry that you have al
lowed your lawyer to dictate to you and your
daughter to write such a letter to me. Only
my dear love for you and the girls ke*rw me
from feeling the anger and indignation such
an epistle deserves from one you have loved co
truly for years, towards whom you have always
hitherto acted In so kind and gentlemanly a
manner. That you love me still I know in
spite of lawyers sad daughters, and will yet
do me Justice.
You know tn your heart of hearts that the
assertion you make In your letter is untrue.
You are an honorable man. I still believe, and
you know that no honorable man could so
plainly show for years his passionate love for
a woman and then ruthlessly throw her aside
In this manner. When you asked me the ques
tion you would have a3ked me years before you
did had I eneourazed you to do so you askel
God to bless our union, and when I tearfully
said "You will be good to ie, I know." you
answered "God knows I will." I cannot allow
mysel' tr> break my sacred promise to you, and
I pray God to make you true to yourself and to
Him in keeping yours to me.
If you allow any meddilng lawyers, laugh
ters or Â«tster-in-law to stop this thing now by
greed of gain and Jealousy, you are not the
gentteman I have allowed to handle me and
fondle me as a passionate man would act to
ward hi* promised wife. â¢ â¢ â¢ You always
â¢aid "The girls an aD right; they want it:
they say, 'Jane is the one.' " â¢ â¢ â¢ ABout
a month ago when you told me how Lulu acted.
at this time I wanted to bid you good-by, as
I then thought It might be better for your
peace of mind, but you would not bid me good
by but took me tn your arms as usual and
merel? said. "Say nothing for a few days and
everything will come out all right." I have
allowed no one to dictate to m* what I shall
say to the man I love, for althoush I gave
you and others to think all along I cared noth
ing for you, it would have been supernatural
frr me to remain cold toward you when you
Â«howed so very plainly how much you cared
for me. You have called yourself my husband
while out with me. and before God you belong
to me in every way except In the one thing
a. vlrtueus woman cannot give a man until
the laws of the country make them one.
Must I believe that you would have even
taken this from me had I shown you that it
was at all poci"ible. txÂ»cauÂ«e you were afraid
to marry me under your daughters' displeas
ure.
God help us both If you make me conclude
this, for I cannot answer for myself if I am
convinced of it. Your* In very truth.

Interesting developments are looked for
from Mazie Nicholl when she is called.
She has been her father* a amanuensis for

adjournment that the defendant will also

Pope's Health Is Grocd.
ROME. Sept. 12.â Alarming rumors are
-t that the Pope is ill. but they are
ieclared to be without foundation.
late. For five months there have been lit
tle family differences In the Council, and
or. one memorable occasion some mem
bers accused other members of taking
snap Judgments ' and a retort was made
that "grumbling and growling" would not
help to fix the tax levy. It Is also on rec
ord that one member said he was able to
look out for himself, while another one
accused still another member of acting In
a cowardly manner.
All these little affairs, however, are
simply amicable methods of adjusting
family differences. Mr. Rowe said ao
officially.
Taking snap judgments, making little
threats about self-preservation ana other
little affairs, which have caused mem
bers to turn white or red in the face, do
not indicate hatred, malice, envy or un
charltableness; they are simply Oakland
esque. So say 3 President Rowe. and as
he has presided over all the delibera
tions of the City Council since it took
office he is competent to speak.
When Mr. Mott hints at silurianlsm in
regard to the opening of Washington
street, and suj?gests that some of his col
leagues are guided by sentiment more
than sense: when Mr. Cnrellier says that
some of the members are falling
on the municipal water plant proposition
and breaks his glasses as he says so:
when Mr. Stetson charges Girard with
ecaose Girard chides Stetson
for wasting the time of the Council in
trying to raise a relative's salary: when
Mr Row*'? feelings become so intense
that he does his talking without leaving
the chair; when Mr. Girard hints that
certain people have gone crazy over the
school, when all these or similar
things were done by the old Council a
name was readily found for them. But
now they are merely "friendly discus
sions" carried on in an amicable way as
at "a family gathering." Bo says M-
Rowe, and he also says that the news
papers are all wrong if they place dif
ferent constructions upon them. I

FERRY SUICIDE WASHED
ASHORE AT SAN PABLO
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
908 Broadway, Sept. 12.
There is no longer any mystery attached
to the identity of the young man who
jumped from the ferry boat on the even
ing of August 21. He was Andrew G.
Amland. residing at 1 Morrow place, San
Francisco.
Yesterday afternoon a body was washed
ashore north of San Pablo. It had been
in the water so long that identification
was impossible, but in the clothing was
found a card bearing the name and ad
dress given. Coroner Curry took charge
of the body and is communicating with
the deceased's relatives in San Francisco.
The floating ashore of the remains of
young Amland bears out the truth fti his
brother's surmise the day after trie sui
cide was reported. When young Amland
lumped from the steamer Oakland the
ferry boat's crew attempt to rescue
him but only succeeded in finding his
hat ' Am!and's brother Charles, fearing
that Andrew had taken his life, carefully
inspected the hat and declared it to be
that of Andrew. : V"Â»; â  Â.
The identification of the suicide also
clears up a romantic story which orig
inated with MrÂ». Clarence Avery, living
on the San Leandro road. Mrs. Avery
was on the boat from which Amland
jumped, and as her husband had left her
a week previously to go East the story
was circulated that the suicide might be
Mr. Avery.

MURDERER HUNT
PROVES TO BE
A DEGENERATE
insane Behavior at
the Inquest.
Robert L. Hunt laughed heartily yes
terday forenoon when witnesses at the
Coroner's inquest described how he shot
and killed George Elliott and seriously
wou:. -keeper E. R. Knippen
berg on Steuart street last. Saturday.
Hunt sat in a corner of the room near
the witness stand and "enjoyed" the pro
ceedings as thqugh they were a farce got
up for his amusement. Several times he
assisted the memory of the witnesses
when they halted in their recital of the
threats made by himself, and was Quick
to prompt them, notwithstanding" the pro
tests of Coroner Hill. Thus, when one of
the witnesses was telling about Hunt hav
ing threatened to murder Mr. Simpson,
Hunt corrected him by giving the initials
as well as the name "A. M. Simpson."
When Hunt was asked whether he
wished to take the stand in his own behalf ;
he said that he did, and took the witness'
chair with cheerful alacrity as though
he were going to tell a funny story. He
declared unhesitatingly that he had done
the shooting and that the soul of Mrs.
Emily Russell had entered into possession
of him and had prompted him to do the
deed. He said that she was known as
Mrs. Delamore and that she had in his
company visited saloons up north and
drank champagne with him. He vus
proud of being obsessed by "the h>ly
spirit of the woman," as he called It, end
did not for an Instant exhibit remorse or
shame. It became apparent that Hunt
was a degenerate and that that fact bad
more to do with his insanity than s'ny
Injury that he might have received upon
the hoad by the fall of a portion of a roof
upon him several years ago, as stated by
his friends. .
Coroner Hill, suspecting this to be the
case, put a question to test Hunt on this
point, and Hunt Immediately became so
obscene in word and action that the ma
tron fled from the room in horror and the !
policeman In charge was obliged to use
force to make the murderer desist. The
Jury returned a verdict charging Hunt
with the murder of Elliott.
Hunt was arraigned in Judge Mogan's
court in the morning on the charge of
assault to murder the saloon-keeper at
1122 euart street and the case was con
tinued until Friday.

ROSENGERE'S DEMAND
Makes Another Application for a
Complaint Against the Union
Iron Works.
Secretary Rosenberg of the Foderate-1
rradi s Council oa-Ut-d yesterday upon As
sistant United States Attorney Banning
SEARCHING FOR THE DERELICT LOG RAFT.
and renewed his wemanci ror a compiami
itnd a warrant for the arrest of the man
agers of the Union Iron on a
! charge of violating the Federal eight-hour
I law by working more than eight hours per
day upon the Government transports get
ting them ready to carry soldiers and
supplies to Manila. Banning asked
I whether Rosenberg was -willing to swear
that the law had been violated since Ban
ning had written to the Union Iron Works
people with regard to the subject, and
whether he would swear that the work
was not one of emergency.
It appeared to Banning that the fitting
out of transports in time of w;ir *was a
matter of emergency, and that being the
case a prosecution would not hold.
Rosenberg left after promising to maite
the necessary investigation.
INTEREST IN LOCAL
POLITICS REVIVING
REPUBLICANS TALK OF SIDNEY
M. SMITH FOR MAYOR.
W. G. Doane Would Not Decline the
Nomination for Auditor â Demo
crats Are on Still Hunt for
Supervisors.
Among delegates to the Republican local
convention there is a good deal of talk
in favor of nominating for Mayor Sidney
M. Smith, president of the Cutting Paok-
Ing Company. Delegates who are advo
g his election assert that his ability
is unquestioned, that his character is
without a blemish and that his knowledge
of San Francisco affairs cannot be dis
puted.
Night before last the Thirty-ninth As
sembly District delegation of the Repub
lican convention held a meeting. The
â  tfs had the pleasure of listening
to a lalk from W. <~>. Doane, who would
not decline a nomination for Auditor. In
order to exercise Influence in the affairs
of the convention the delegates represent
ing the Thirty-ninth will endeavor to vote
as a unit.
This evening the committee of perma
nent organization and order of business
of the convention will meet at the Grand
Hotel. Friday next there will be a meet-
Ing of the executive committee of the
City Republican League. The chairman
of the committee, Sheldon (i. Kellogg,
Will probably receive a hint from th<> ex
t-cutive committee as to the proper time
for calling another session of the nom

Seven del< gates to the Democratic local
convention are still hunting for accept
able names to place on the ticket for
the Board of Supervisors.
The committee of seven met yesterday
in the law office of a. vv. Thompson. The
next session may take place- in Mr Whit
ings office. The Democrats who are anx
ious to get on the ticket can hardly keep
track of the wandering seven. A long lint
of names has been submitted to ti om
mittee, as each district was Invited to rec
ommend candidates, but only eighteen
names will bo presented to the convention.

EXAMINER HAS
TO TAKE ITS
OWN MEDICINE
Crawfishes on One of
Its Fakes.
APOLOGIZES TO OCCIDENTALS
SAYS THE LARKSPUR "ORGY"
WAS A PIPE DREAML
The Author of the Zolaesqne Fairy
Tale Hauled Over the Coals for
His Full-Page "Inadver
tence."
Persons picking up the Examiner this
morning and finding little news will
please excuse that paper. It hadn't time
to get any yesterday as it was so busy
apologizing to the people of Larkspur
for its attack on their characters and so
frantically endeavoring to take back all
it had published concerning the alleged
indulgence of Occidental campers in "bac
chanalian revels."
It was all an "inadvertence," says the
Examiner in explanation of its Zolaesque
portrayal of saturnalia that refused to
stay nailed. Of course the people of
Larkspur believe that statement. Look-
Ing through a pair of Examiner specta
cles they can readily see how an inad
vertence can be spread all over a page.
With the same eyeglasses they can con
jure up a camel doing a flipllap as he
passes through the eye of a needle. It's
all in the point of view, as some phil
osopher has said; all in the point of view.
Sunday morning last, viewed by F.
Bailey Millard. who had an ax to grind
and no water with which to grind it, the
point of view was different. He took up
almost a page of the now tearful Ex
aminer in telling what a bad lot were the
young men of Occidental camp. "Bac- '
chanalian satyrs," "Neroites of Baltl
more Canyon," "hoodlums rampant," j
etc., ad lib", were added to his book of i
synonyms as equivalents for the unsus
pecting campers, lie called their brand- I
new piano a hurdy-gurdy and a dilapi
dated music machine; he said their Dark
town <litties were ragtime dlableries;
andâ most wonderful of all in that
"truthful" descriptionâ he said that they i
swam in the "altogether" while enjoying
siestas!
As the Sunday editor of the Examiner
alone Millard was not satisfied to vent I
bifl spite on the campers. He unloaded
several columns on their devoted heads in
that capacity, but that was not enough.
He lowered himself on the newspaper lad
derâstooped to conquer, as it wereâ and.
ai "a reporter for the Examiner who vis- |
ited the scene yesterday," lashed into
I them for half a column. Even then his,
rage was at the boiling point and It was
i not until he had ripped the revelers up the
\ back as a "cottager" and ripped them
'â  down again as "a resident of Baltimore
> ctnyon who lives on the hillside just
above the camp grounds," that he stopped
I the as the Examiner calls Its "mad
I vc-rttnce."
I On numerous occasions during the week
! preceding the publication of the "lnadver
! tencc." Millard gloated publicly on the
i "package he was about to hand" the
! campers. He boasted to several employes
! of the North Pacific Coast Railroad Com
! pany that he had "a roast prepared that
| would peel the skin from the campers,"
I advising those to whom he spoke to watch
| for the following Sunday edition of the
Examiner.
Mr. Mlllard was busy explaining yester
day to the managing editor how the "In
advertence" ha/i been allowed to take on
| such large proportions. At a late hour
; last night the returns were not all in.
! The managing editor, however, was rest
| Ing somewhat easier than lie did the night
before while supervising the building of a
I retraction that might retract as little aa
< possible In his inside pocket the manag- ;
j ing e'litor of the Kxaminer had the letter
I written by Mlllard to Will Moore, business
manager of the Monitor and manager of
i iccldental camp. Moore "inadvertently"
loaned it to the managing editor, who in
timated he needed it in the business of
animadverting the Mlllard "inadvert
<â¢]](<*." Yesterday afternoon Mr. Moorp,
repenting the fact that he had given the
lotter to the managing editor, tried to get
it again. He was unable to see the man
aging editor, but was told by one of his
representatives that they wished to send
it to Mr. Hearst.
In writing the letter threatening the Oc
cidental campers with all sorts of terms
in Kan Quentin for their alleged felonies,
Mr. Milard had "inadvertently" used an
Examiner letterhead.
Twice again last night a representative
of Mr. Moore tried to secure an audience
with the. managing editor of the Exam
iner, so as to come at the letter, but each
tkne was informed that that functionary
was out. Mr. Moore begins to think that
not the managing editor but he himself
is outâ that letter.
Foster Assevedo, the lessee of the ground
upyn which the fake bacchanalian orgies
were alleged to have taken place, was In
this city yesterday in consultation with
an attorney, bent upon bringing an action
against the author of the defamatory
article in last Sunday's Examiner.
"It was nothing but lies," he said,
"from beginning to end. That man Mil- :
lard did it out of spite. The Occidental
boys are not the only ones from whom lie i
tried to collect money for water from
the spring I leose. When I allowed him
to connect his pipe with the spring I told
him that the fact that he paid $4 a year
rental would nor. warrant his interference
with any campers to whom I might rent
grounds. I made him understand distinct
ly that the campers were first as far as
that spring was concerned. How did he 1
live up to that agreement? Last season I
he allowed the owners of two houses, |
! Shultz and Kllllp, to tap his pipe and us* |
; my water, for which he charged them $21
a month apiece. He made the same deal j
with John Gormley. This year he tried It j
< n Gormley and when I heard of It I told i
Millard he was no gentleman."
James Shultz. one of the proprietors of !
the Larkspur baths, said yesterday that '
he intended to sue Mlllard because of the
false statement in the sensational story j
that campers of both sexes were in the |
habit of bathing together at his place
! without bathing suits.

FLEET OF TUGS
SEARCHING FOR
THE LOG RAFT
Insurance Men and
Owners Anxious.
The derelict lop raft is giving shipping
men and the local underwriters a great
deal of uneasiness. The big mass of piles
is somewhere right in the track of ves
sels bound up and down the coast, and is
therefore a serious menace to navigation.
There Is over fix million feet of lumber
in the structure and there is about $75,000
insurance on it. Hence the uneasiness of
the underwriters.
If the raft is to be picked up it should
be heard from within the next forty-eight
hours. The Fearless may have picked it
up, and if she has will bring it into port.
Early yesterday morning- the Czarina
went out again and later in the day she
was followed by the tugs Rescue and Sea
Que*n. The latter vensel will tow the
schooner Norma to Fort Bragg and as
soon as that job is accomplished she will
Join the Rescue, Fearless and (.."zarina in
the search for the- derelict. The steamer
President of the Alaska Packers' fleet
will probably go out to-day, ho that five
steamers will be searching for the raft
by this afternoon. A number of vessels
reached port yesterday, but none of them
saw a trace of the derelict. It is still
somewhere between Point Arena and
Point Reyes but no one has been able
positively to say that he saw it since the
ship Oriental bo nearly ran it down. Yes
terday the steamers Robert Adamson,
Noyo, State of California and Glenogle all
arrived from northern ports, but not one
of them caught sight of the raft.
Captain George Harvey went out in
command of the tug Sea Queen, as Cap
tain "Ike" Smith is confined to his home
With a serious Illness.
The cruiser Marblehead was towed to
Mare Island by the navy yard tug Una
dilla yesterday. She will go on the dry
dock for an overhauling and will come
out of retirement some time next month.
The Oceanic Steamship Company's mail
steamer Australia arrived from Honolulu
yesterday. She brought up a full cargo
and about fifty cabin passengers and over
100 in the steerage. The passage was a
very pleasant one and the run was made
in six days and twelve hours. The cabin
passengers were:
Mr and Mrs. Atwater, five children and
servant. Mr. and Mrs. J. B. Atherton, A.
Atherton. A. F. Afong, Mr. and Mrs. H.
G. Boswell and daughter, Mrs. E. Benner,
Miss Benner, Miss M. Burns, Thomas

L. F. Stone, Mr. Steinhart, Mrs. C. D.
AV right, Mrs. F. M. AVakefield, C. F.
Wall, Mr. Withers.
Ignatz Steinhart returns after a visit to
Honolulu in connection with the establish
ment of the First American Bank of Ha
waii. Mrs. AY. G. Irwin comes to San
Francisco in connection with the erection
of her palatial home on Pacific Heights
and also to look after the education of her
daughter, Miss Helene Irwin. A. F.
Afong, brother of Mrs. Captain Whiting
of the United States navy. Is going to
Yale to complete his studies.
Harry Nichols, a 13-year-old lad who
returned from Honolulu on the Australia,
has an ardent desire to get to Manila.
He left his home in Missouri over six
months ago and made his way to San
Francisco. When the transport Pennsyl
vania sailed Harry was aboard as a stow
away. AVhen discovered he was placed
under arrest, but before he could be hand-
I ed over to the United States Consul at
| Honolulu he made his escape. After the
Pennsylvania got away young Nichols
got work on the United States steamer
Iroquois and finally a passage back here
on the Australia was arranged for him.
AVhen Harry walked down the gangway
of the steamer yesterday morning he had
$1 7n in his pocket, but he says that is
enough to keep him until he can stow
away en another transport.
Three of the salmon fleet are making
long passages. The bark Coryphene is
now out 30 days, the Merom 24 days and
the ship W. H. Macy 31 days from Bristol
Bay. Head winds and calms have prob
ably delayed them, and to-day or to-mor
row they may show up off the heads In a
bunch.
The steamer Nippon Maru sailed for the
Orient yesterday with a valuable cargo
and a fair passenger list. There was the
usual crowd down to see her off.
The British tramp steamer Glenogle,
that has lately "been carrying merchandise
from china for the Pacific Mail and
Northern Pacific, arrived from Tacoma in
ballast yesterday. She is under charter
to the Government, and will be turned
into a transport as quickly as possible.
Joe Fountain, a newsboy, was treated at
the Harbor Hospital yesterday by Drs.
Robinson and Murphy for a serious cut in
the leg. He was sitting on a doorstep on
Stevenson street, between Second and
Third, when a band of young hoodlums
came along. Their leader was John Wel
don, and he had an open pocket-knife in
his hand. "Watch me make this guy
jump," he remarked to his companion,
and with that he stuck the blade of the
knife into Fountain's thigh. With that
the crowd ran away and Fountain was
taken to the Harbor Hospital. The police
are looking for AVeldon.
The San FYancisco owned ship Eclipse
is back in Sydney harbor, much the worse
for an encounter with a hurricane. She
Bailed from Newcastle. N. S. W., for Hon
olulu with a cargo of coal, and soon after
she got out a terrific storm came up. The
cargo shifted, the seams opened and at
one time it looked as though the vessel
would go down. AVhen the storm abated
she was leaking pretty badly, but the
crew finally managed to get her into Syd
ney.
There are only three disengaged vessels
in port, and they would not be idle a mo
ment if their owners would accept the
ruling charter rates. They are the Brit
ish ships British Isles, Cambrian Hills
and Claverdon. All of them are holding
out for 2s 6d a ton more than the offering
rate. At this time last year there were
over twenty disengaged vessels in port.
HOW ALFALFA LAND IS
ASSESSED IN MERCED
They assess valuable land very low
down in Merced County, and the State j
Board of Equalization does not know of I
it. Samuel O. Crittenden. a respectable
farmer whose place is near the thriving
hamlet of Ingomar, let the cat out of the
bag yesterday morning when giving tes
timony before United States Commission
er Iloarork in the matter of the San Joa
quin and Kings River Canal and Irriga
tion Company against the County of
Stanislaus, itn Board of Supervisors and
others. The Supervisors fixed the rates
j to be charged by the corporation at a flg-
I ure which the irrigation company declares
i virtually amounts to a confiscation of its
i property.
Mr. Crittenden corroborated the testi
mony of the other witnesses as to the al
falfa industry in that part of the country.
He told how it cost about $7 or $S per acre
to prepare the ground and put it in al
falfa, and 25 cents an acre to keep tho;
checks in ordor and put the water upon
the land, exclusive of the cost of the
water, and that for the first five years of
' cultivation the yield was from seven to
! eight tons of alfalfa hay per acre, the
hay bringing in the nearest market from
$4 to $4 50 per ton.
"What is the average value of land with
alfalfa on it in your neighborhood?" was
asked.
"About $100 per acre. I'd hate to have
to take $100 per acre for mine."
"What is your land assessed for?" was
the next question.
The witness blushed slightly as he re
plied "sl2 per acre."
The smile that went round the court
i'room was an indication that the land of
the other witnesses had been treated
equally as leniently by the Assessor as
Mr. Crittenden's.
The taking of further testimony in the
case will be continued during the next
two days.
