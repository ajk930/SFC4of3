in 1863 by the concern of Jar dine, Matheson & Co., but were sub
sequently included in ihe new concessions to Russia, the owners,
under the advice and protection of Mr. Hurst, the British Consul,
sent workmen to fence in the tract.
After the work was begun a dozen Cossacks from thf Russian
consulate appeared on the scene and forcibly ejected the workmen.
The captain of the British second-class gunboat JVoodlark,
especially designed for service on the river, after consulting with
Mr. Hurst, landed a party of bluejackets and moved the JVoodlark
within firing distance of the Russian consulate. For a time a fight
seemed imminent, but nothing further occurred. The bluejackets
arc now guarding the property.
The British third-class gunboat Esk has been dispatched to
Hankow from this port. Great Britain is evidently determined to
uphold British rights.

The Daily Telegraph calls the speech
"An informal ultimatum."

MANILA. Aug. 22, via Hongkong,
Aug. 27. â Recent events have
proved somewhat discouraging
to officials who are trying to
accompany war with a policy
of conciliation. Two new municipal
governments have collapsed through
the treachery of the Mayors.
To-day the Mayor of San Pedro Ma
. cate, who was. elected by the people
! under the direction of Professor Dean
Worcester of the united States Advis
ory Commission of the Philippines, was
brought to Manila and lodged in jail.
The United States officers at San Pe
dro Macate found that he was using his
office as a recruiting station for the
Philippine army. Four disguised in
surgent officers were helping him. The
Mayor of Baliuag was also arrested
and confined in the same prison. The
Americans caught him passing between
the line of the two armies with incrim
inating documents, which the authori
ties secured. Another prominent na
tive Mayor is under surveillance.
When the result of the election at
Imus, which General Lawton and Pro
fessor Worcester engineered, was
announced the Americans inquired
as to the whereabouts of the
people's choice and were in-
ciple, Aubron Herbert, who is versed
in the mind and beliefs of the master,
has spoken out regarding the question
In a letter issued to-day. He writes
quite in the vein of an American anti
imperialist, and says:
"We have come to this point that
the Government is looked on as the
owner of everything in a country, in
cluding the minds and consciences,
bodies and material possessions, and
with almost Eastern resignation we al
low it, unchallenged and unquestioned,
to do what it likes with us.
"Suppose the Government succeeds in
committing us to this war. Then when
we are engaged in shooting down a race
who have many real virtues, and whose
faults are chiefly the old-time faults
of narrowness, prejudice and that be
lief in privilege which has existed
everywhere in every nation from the
days of 'the Greeks, who rested their;
republic on slavery, up to our own day;
suppose it should gradually dawn upon
us that the shooting down of these men
was a bit of unnecessary murder, just
one more blood-stained blunder in the
game which our restless and unscrup
ulous politicians play?"

â
/p EN NES, Aug. 28âGen-
Jf\ eral Mercier was present
as usual in the front row of
witnesses' seats when the fourth
week of the court-martial trial of
Captain Dreyfus was begun this
morning. M. Ja fay-Laval, the
draughtsman whose testimony was
begun Saturday, continued with
the aid of a blackboard his refuta
tion of the argument of M. Ber
tillon.
RENNES. Aug. 27.â The Government
has decided to prosecute the Eclaire for
the publication of the â¢"Canaille de
D " documents, one of the docu
ments secretly communicated to the
Dreyfus court-martial of 1894. and whiph
has been shown not to refer to Captain
Dreyfus at all. The object of the Gov
ernment is to discover who communi
cated it to Eclaire. The assumption
is that the communication was made by
Colonel Dv Paty de Clam, or possibly
by General Gonse. The publication oc
jarred three years >, but under the
aw prosecution may be maintained at
any time during the following five
years. 'Â, , . - --..
The Government has issued orders
for the prosecution of a contributor to
the Eclaire and M. Hassard, director of
the Patrie. The former will be charged
with having printed a perversion of the
"Canaille de D " document as "that
beast of a Dreyfus is really becoming
too exacting."
A semi-official note issued this even
ing ' makes the following announce
ment:
"The statistical section of the general
staff bureau at the war office no longer
concerns itself with espionage ques
tions, which are now properly confined
to the detective service. The statistical
section is especially concerned with the
relations of the war office to French
military attaches abroad."
This evening it was rumored that the
Government has decided to arrest Gen
eral Mercier, but the rumor is not con
firmed.
Last evening a report was in circula-
I formed that he was in prison at Bill- I
bid, where the authorities had placed
him on suspicion cf being a revolution-
ist. He was released and installed as i
Mayor.
Such events and conditions tend to
give color to the assertions of foreign
residents acquainted with the native
character, .who insist that a great ma
jority of the natives sympathize with
the insurgents and elect officials whom
they know to be revolutionists.
For two weeks Manila has been po
liced at night with unusual vigilance.
Apparently the authorities are expect
inl, trouble.
The trend of affairs tends to make the
policy of leniency unpopular among the
Americans. When the Filipinos aban
doned Morong they burned the whole
town. Colonel Smith of the Twelfth In
fantry, who is in command at Angeles, I
is skeptical regarding Filipino friend- j
ship. Instead of allowing the natives
to return to the town as heretofore, he |
has ordered his troops to shoot all men â 
trying to pass the lines and to turn
back the women and children. He re- â¢
cently gave the amigos in the town an
opportunity to prove their professed '
friendship, putting them at. work dig
ging trenches and cleaning streets, but ;
this only displeased them.
The foremost citizen- of Angeles, a :
lawyer who had welcomed the Ameri
cans with a great show of cordiality,
was found communicating with the in
surgents. The Americans promptly
marched him off to San Fernando to
stand trial.
THORITE TO BE USED
AGAINST FILIPINOS
WASHINGTON. Aug. 27.â 50 satisfac
tory have been the results of experi
ments made with thorite, the new high
explosive, that it will be recommended
by the Board of Ordnance and Fortifica
tions for use in the Philippine campaign.
General Miles told me this afternoon it
probably would be so employed.
Being president of the board, the gen
eral has paid close attention to high ex
plosives and has given especial considera
tion to thorite. Up to this time it; has
successfully undergone the various trials
to which it has been subjected. It will
explode according to official reports, only
by means of a detonator, and then only
when confined. A quantity of thorite can
be distributed on a hard surface and
struck with a hammer and will not ex
plode It is not inflammable. If placed
upon a hot surface it will merely burn
into a crisp. A red-hot poker placed in
the "explosive will only burn the grains
with which it comes into contact and
the fire will not spread to the rest of the
substance. Two 10-inch shells _ loaded
with the explosive were fired . through a
5-inch plate and failed to explode.

tion that General Mercier ha" fled to j
the Island of Jersey, but this story ;
proved to be without foundation. Early
this morning the gendarmes were still
posted outside of the residence of Gen
eral St. Germain, military commander
of this district, "with whom General
Mercier has been staying during the
trial. Their presence indicated that he
was still there, and in reply to ques
tions they declare that they had not
seen him leave the grounds.
This afternoon he was undoubtedly
at home, although he declined to re
ceive callers. No one who has studied
his character and methods believes that
General Mercier would flee at the pros
pect of arrest. He has altogether too
much doggedness in his composition.'
General St. Germain's house is in one
of the suburbs of Rennes.

OF BERTILLON'S SYSTEM

i tend a private refutation of M. Bertillon's
i system, by which he claims to identify
t tonator the explosive is of the first
' order, breaking the steel walls of the
shell into small particles.
All of these advantages have caused
j the board to regard thorite with con
l siderable interest. When Secretary Root
visits the Sandy Hook proving grounds
[on Thursday he may witness another
trial of the explosive.
The great value of a high explosive
; which may be safely fired from high-
power guns has long been appreciated
by military- men. The twelve dynamite
guns which will be shipped this week to
Manila are excellent in their way, but
it is believed that, working in conjunc
tion with high-power guns throwing
thorite, the moral effect, not to mention
the death and destruction they will deal,
will have a salutary effect upon the Fili
j pinos.
OTIS IS MERCIFUL
TO CONDEMNED MEN
WASHINGTON. Aug. 27.â A report just
received by, the War Department from
General Otis gives details of the court-
martial proceedings In a number of
cases.
In one case three officers of the Span-
ish army in charge of the Presidio of Ma
nila were used of embezzling large
amounts. The commandant. of the Presi
| dio, Carlos Aymerich, was acquitted, but
Captain Zorita was found guilty of em
bezzling J10.54S and Adjutant Ruiz was
found guilty of embezzling a like
amount. They were sentenced to con-
finement at hard labor for three years,
but General Otis reduced the sentence to
six months, owing to the confinement
they had already served. one of the
Spanish prisoners of war, Rafael Albert,
was convicted of having brutally mur
dered another soldier and was sentenced
to be hanged. The sentence was disap
proved on technical grounds and the
Spanish soldier continues to be held a
prisoner of war. . â¢. v
One of the court-martial cases gives
the acquittal of* an American volunteer
officer and several soldiers on the charge
of having looted a house at Hollo and
taking furniture and crockery, silver
ware, jewelry, etc., at the time of the
occupation or the city. In another case
a Filipino native was found guilty of kill-
ing a Chinese and sentenced to be
hanged, but General Otis disapproved the
finding.
General Otis in general order No. 9 di-
rects that the troops give particular at-
tention to furnishing full protection to
the lives and property of all German in-
habitants of the islands. As the Consul
of Germany is looking to the security of
the Swiss, Austrian, Italian and Portu-
fuese residents, Injunction was given to
urnish similar protection to these peo
ple. *
- General Otis' desire to prevent disorder
within Manila is shown by frequent
orders. In one order the troops are
warned against the seizing of horses, car-
riages or other property. The burning of
houses is 1 strictly prohibited, unless the
same are used, to shelter the enemy or as
places <of r concealment for contraband of
war. General Otis states "the lives of the
inhabitants, natives and foreigners, will
be protected and they will be permitted
to pursue their ordinary" vocations with
out molestation or harm."

Th" man to demonstrate Bertillon's

afternoon astonished all present. By very
simple means he showed exactly and thor

Moreover, M. Bernard exposed the fact
that all of M. Bertillon's measures ap
plied to the bordereau have* been falsified.
all his calculations misinterpreted, all his
plates and photographic enlargements
slightly doctored in order that they may
fit certain arbitrary rules.
Nothing but the very fullest report can
give an idea of how thoroughly M. Ber
nard smashes M. Bertillon, Unless Gen
eral Mercier's arrest should come like a
thunderbolt to him, M. Bertillon will
surely fight with the fury of a maniac for
his hobby.
The duel between M. Bernard and M.

to-morrow, and from what I have seen
to-day the chances ar*? that the sitting
will be gay.*&|SÃÃl

CHILDREN PERISH IN
A BURNING CONVENT
Many Lives Known to Have Been Lost
During a Conflagration That Razed St.
Anne's at Sparkill, N. Y.
SPABKILL, N. V., Aug. 28.â this morning destroyed St.
Anne's Convent here, and it is reported that many children have
been burned to death. There were upward of 500 occupants in
the building when the fire broke out.
NEW YORK, Aug. 2S. â A special to the "World from Nyack says: Fire
was discovered in the large boys' and girls* orphan asylum connected with
St. Ann's Convent at Sparkill, Orange County, at 1 a. m. to-day (Mon
day), but not before the entire structure, a frame building, was wrapped
in flames. Many of the inmates (children) were burned or suffocated, it
was reported early this mor: The exact number of the dead could not
be told at 3:15 a. m., when the first dispatches reached this city.
George A. Martine of Sparkill, one of those who first discovered' the
fire, telephoned to Nyack for assistance. Mazeppa engine company respond
ed from that place. Eight doctors went to the asylum from Nyack.
A request for aid was telephoned to Piedmont. Empire Engine Com
pany was dispatched from Piedmont to the scene of the fire. Piedmont is this
side of Nyack and both engines with their complements of fire-fighters ar
rived at about the same time.
The asylum, which is conducted by the Sisters of Mercy, held about 1000
children. It was a long frame building, three stories high. The flames were
not discovered until the whole building was one mass of fire. The children
had a scant chance for escape.
The secens at the conflagration were heartrending. The children, clad in
their night robes, could be seen falling backward into the furnace of flame
and smoke, while the shrieks of the dying could be heard above the crackle
of the devouring flames. Some of the children were crippled for life by
Jumping from the windows. Many of the Sisters were injured, while others
lost their lives heroically while trying to rescue their charges.
Although the service of the fire apparatus from neighboring places had
been promptly rendered, the engines arrived too late to be effective in sav
ing life or property. The fire started oh the upper floor of the three-story
building. Nearly 300 of the occupants of the convent occupied rooms on this
floor and all the dormitories were lighted with kerosene lamps. There is
little doubt that the fire was caused by the explosion of one of these lamps.
The fire spread rapidly upward and burned through the shingle roof of the
building in two places.
At the time of discovery the fire had made such progress that the Sis
ters could not -awaken the hundreds of children under their care, mar
shal them in order and march them from the building, .as was their practice
in the fire drills. Many of the little victims were suffocated in their sleep.

from Paris says: Albert Clemenceau.
lawyer, politician, writer and brother of
Georges Clemenceau, said to-day:
"Thus far the trial has been used as a
vehicle for personal justifications. Ob
viously most of thg_ witnesses- -felt the
necessity of justifying themselves before
the public, and frequently in a vain effort
to do this have lost sight of the main
issue. /-.'.'â 
"Ip to the present the obvious Scotch
verdict 'not proven' applies to the case.
The only result thus far is to show the
weakness of the prosecution and perhaps
settle both parties more violently in their
respective attitudes.
"The court, being composed of laymen.
approaches the case In a different mental
state from lawyers. Laymen admit senti
ment to cases. Lawyers invariably ward
off all that is immaterial to the question
at issue. If this principle were applied
to the evidence adduced at Rennes a
microscope would be needed to find what
remains.
"If Dreyfus be fairly tried by the exist
ing legal machinery the trial should
satisfy all. Dreyfus is legally Innocent
until legally proven guilty. Thus far there
is no such proof. Should he be recon
demned the Court of Cassation can again
review the law of the case and decide if
there has been any legal Informality in
the trial." __^___^^^___

NEW YORK, Aug. 27.â 0n the New
YOrk division of the Pennsylvania Rail
road the automatic block signaling sys
tem was completed to-day by placing In
service the lp.st connecting link between
New Brunswick and Monmouth Junction.
N. J. Mechanics had been busily engaged
for months extending it. until the entire
New York division is now equipped.
The signal system is electric in its oper
ation, the current being supplied from
storage batteries placed at Intervals along
â¢the track and carried by means of the
rails. At intervals of a quarter of a mile
the tracks are spanned by a light frame
work, on which the signals are placed.
These consist of the usual semaphore sig
nals for daytime and lanterns for the
night. The signals are exactly like the
band-signaling system, the upper signal
being red and the one beneath it green.
When the blocks which they protect are
clear the arms are lowered, and at night
display a white light. As soon as a train
passes the signal bridge It completes an
electrical circuit, which operates the
mechanism so that signals are displayed
at .'.anger. When the first train passes
the next succeeding block the same
mechanism drops the first blade, mdi
eating that the block from which it has
just passed is clear. Tin- lower signal
standing indicates that the train is still
it*, the next block beyond. When the train
has left that block a gre-n arm is dropped,
and the engine driver of the next train
knows from the position of the semaphore ;
signals that there is nothing in the next
two blocks. The only danger is that the
system may get out of order, but every
precaution is taken to prevent this. When
out of â¢irvlr-r the signals display the red or
danger sign. At junction points the auto
matic. system is supplemented by hand
signaling. The new system does away
with many telegraph operators, and It Is j
contended that it Insures greater safety.
GRADERS UNCOVER A
RICH COPPER LEDGE
Lies Along the Canadian Pacific in
British Columbia and Assays
Very High.
TACOMA. Wash., Aug. 27.- While grad
ing the Canadian Pacific extensions in
British Columbia contractors McKensie
and Mann have uncovered three great
ledges of ore running high in copper, gold
and silver. While thoy are making gopd
profits on the railroad contract, present
indications are thai these mineral dis
coveries will pay them far better. A min
ing expert who has just come from British
Columbia says that one ledge alone will
make them millionaires.
This ledge was found near Cascade, a
new town on the Columbia and Western
Railroad which the Canadian Pacific Is
building from Rossland into the Boundary
Creek district Outcroppings were dis
covered some time ago. but it was only
ten days ago that the ledge itself was un
covered by the graders. It has not been
thoroughly explored. but has been
stripped sufficiently to show that it ex
ceeds 50 feet in width. Assays from near
the surface give values of $40 to $50 per
ton, making it practically certain that an
other Leroi or Republic mini has been
discovered. McKenzl and Mann tiled on
the property and will soon begin develop
ment. They have declined a large sum for
it. Two smaller ledges have been uncov
ered by their grading crews, both giving
promise of making good mines.

DEWEY'S SUGGESTIONS
TO PARADE COMMITTEE
IWould Be Gratified, He Says, if the
I Olympia's Battalion Leads
I the March. Â«
NEW YORK, Aug. 27.â The executive
committee of the Dewey reception com
; mittee has received two letters from Ad
! miral Dewey. In the first, dated Leg
i horn, August 16, he says:
j "I shall without fail reach the Lower
Bay on Friday. September 29, and shall
anchor there for the night to be ready
for the official arrival and naval parade
on the 'following morning. Saturday, the
80tH. While I should be gratified to meet
any of my friends in the navy and
especially the commanding officers of the
ships engaged at Manila May 1, 1898, I feel
that this matter of invitation should be
left entirely with the committee. I would
i suggest that at the end of the display of
! fireworks off the Battery the oivmpia
should return to North River and an-
chor off Twenty-sixth street. While your
letter seems to indicate that the bat-
talion Of the Olympia would lead In the
land parade, still lam In doubt. It would
be a gratification to me and the officers
and men of the Olympia should the
Olympia's battalion of about 250 men be
placed at the head of the -column. In
reference to the smoker it 1% proposed
to give for the men, that is a matter
that comes within the province of the
captain of the ship, but I have little
doubt that he would be pleased to accept
1 foi* them. I am much pleased for various
; reasons for eliminating a dinner from the
: programme, and thank yourself and the
' committee for the careful arrangements
made to spare me any unnecessary fa-
tigue."
In the second letter, written from Na
i pies, August 17, thq admiral asks that a
' "good large military band" be detailed
to lead the Olympia's battalion at the
j head of the land parade, tim Olympia's
small band being hardly equal to the oc
! casion.
Admiral Dewey has been notified that
â  all his requests will he carried out.

DARIEN, Ga.. Aug. 27.â There were no
hostilities between the blacks and the
military to-day. though the negroes re-
main armed. That the situation is Im
proved is evidenced by the fact that
Colonel Lawton, commanding the First
Regiment, has sent back to Savannah
eighty-six men and three officers, whose
services are. no longer needed. There re
main something more than WO soldiers
on duty. These will remain until after
the sitting of the special term of the

for the murder of Deputy Sheriff Town

' The, special term will also try Henry
Dejegall. the negro about whom the
trouble has all heen, and the thirty-five
black rioters who are now confined in the
Savannah jail. It is probable that a
special train and a military escort will
bring the rioters from Savannah for trial.
There are still several hundred armed
negroes In the swamp. A heavy rain has
fallen to-day which will do. much toward
dampening their ardor.
ATLANTA, Aug. 27.â Governor Candler
kept in close communication with Colonel
Lawton of the First Georgia Regiment
all day and expressed satisfaction at the
encouraging messages from the scene of
the trouble in Mcintosh County.

resistance on the part of the negroes.
This evening the Governor was notified
that half of the Savannah regiment had
left Darien for their homes.
The Liberty Independent Cavalry and
two companies of the First Georgia Regi

that he did not expect the negro mob to

physicians adjudged him insane. He was then liberated, but immediately T i
after rearrested, by order of Lady Mo, the power behind the throne of Â«> j
the kingdom. She being an alien, does not share the Korean superstition <& j
with regard to the sanctity of the weak minded, and decreed that Wang J^

DENVER, Aug. 27.â Forest fires, which
itis thought were caused by camp fires. are
raging on the foothills near the entrance
to Platte Canyon, about twenty miles
south of here. The fires started five miles
up the canyon and burned over the moun
tains on both sides of the canyon and are
now devastating the timber section along
j the foothills. " There are a number â¢of
i ranches in the vicinity, and several of
them have been slightly damaged by the
fires. At one time to-day they were
threatened with destruction.
The town of Deer Creek was also in
danger. But the wind changed its course
and drove the flames back to the hills.
To-night the fires were burning fiercely,
and the wind being slight, are gradually
creeping toward Deer Creek again. The
fires illuminate the sky and are plainly
visible from the outskirts "of Denver.
â¢ Millions of feet of timber have been
consumed and the loss will be consider-
able. There are reports of loss of life.

speech yesterday at the opening of At

Lord Kitchener, of Khartoum, said:
"The construction of this magnificent
bridge, . I think, may fairly be considered
a record achievement. So far as the fail
ure of the effort to place the construc
tion order In England Is concerned, I
think It demonstrates that the relations
between labor and capital there are not
sufficient to give confidence to the capi
talist and to induce him to take the risk
of establishing up-to-date workshops that
would enable Great Britain to maintain
her position as the first constructing na
tion In the world.
"But as Englishmen failed, I am de
lighted that our cousins across the*) Atla
ntic stepped in. This bridge is due to their
energy, ability and power to turn out
works of magnitude in less time than
anybody else. I congratulate the Ameri
cans on their success In the erection of a
bridge in the heart of Africa. They have

If the strike of the masons does

say everything Is ripe for a strike,
that would mean a general tie-up

SAN FRANCISCO, Aug. 24. 1599.
THIS IS TO CERTIFY that I had been
afflicted with my head and throat. With
cough and expectoration; my throat was
i so sore and inflamed that I could scarcely
swallow. I became alarmed of my con-
dition and came to San Francisco to con-
sult Dr. Aborn, at 554 Sutter street, and
placed myself under his treatment, and to
to my agreeable surprise he gave me in-
stant relief, and now. after two weeks'
treatment, I am entirely relieved of all
my illness, mv voice is fully restored and
I can eat and swallow as well as I ever
could. When I first applied to Dr. Aborn
I could scarcely speak above a whisper.
I am a miner and leave to-morrow for
home. JOHN WEHRLI.

that I have had my hearing restored in
i three days' treatment with Dr. Aborn, 554

[ FARE ; , MaEUCALYPTUS TREES AS
ANTI-MALARIAL AGENTS
I/Are Being Planted in Gvjba as an Experi
ment to Jest Their HealtKgiVing
Qualities.
*â¢ HAVANA, Aug. 27. â Owing to frequent recommendations to Governor #
. -fc General Brooke of the eucalyptus tree as an anti-malarial agent, some â Â¥â 
* investigations into the subject have been carried on under his orders. At- -fc
* tentlon has been called to the success obtained in cultivating the tree in â¦
the vast Campagna dl Roma, Italy, where eucalyptus is now recognized "*
! as rendering the whole territory much less unhealthy. The City of Mcx- *
i leo is cited as another instance, where the Vigo canal, the Boating gar-
; .fc dens and other malarial districts are now well stocked with young trees,
; -fc with the results that the places which -were once marshy and unh-alth- -fc
â fc ful, have been rendered dry and inocuous. -fc
I "fc One recommendation says that the camp of the British troops in -fc
* Jamaica, which was formerly malarial, has been planted with eucalyp- "fetus,
* * tvs, the outcome already being a steady disappearance of marshy spots. *
ijr The tree, which absorbs the moisture, grows very rapidly, often ten feet "\
_^ ln a year. The wood is valuable and honey bees seek the flowers. The
honey, it is said, contains important medicinal properties.
!-H The Tree Department at Santiago de Cuba, now knowing of the investi- fc
â  -fc gations in progress under General Brooke's direction, recently made a re- -fc
i "fc quest for several thousand eucalyptus slips, the requisition being strongly -fc
'"* Indorsed by General Leonard Wood. The officials in charge of the yellow "fc
"* fever hospital planted several slips some months ago and these are now *
* thriving. It is believed that great good will result from the investiga- *
Â»j tions.
' -^ Several years ago experiments with the eucalyptus tree were tried +__
fc here, the result being satisfactory for the first four years, after which, lt fc
-fc is said, the trees died, but the consensus of opinion among the medical fc
-fc authorities is favorable to a repetition of the experiment, which General -fc
â * Brooke will probably attempt at an early date on a large scale. fc

NEW YORK. Aug. 27.â 1t is learned on
excellent authority that the Northern Pa-
cific Railway Company some time ago dis-
posed of its entire holdings of Oregon
- Railway and Navigation Company stock
to a banking house in this city which Is
closely identified with Union Pacific in-
terest?: The Oregon Short Line, which
is controlled by the Union Pacific, is the
(.wner of practically all the common stock
of the Railway and Navigation Company.
The controlling interests in the preferred
ftock of the latter corporation nas been
owned jointly by the Cnion Pacific. North-
crn Pacific and Great Northern, the hold-
ings of the last two being equal in amount
but the Union Pacific holdings being much
larger than those of either of the others.
By the transfer of the Northern Pa-
cific's interest, it is understood, the Union
Pacific secures control of the preferred
â stock of the Oregon Railway and Navi
gation Company, the common stock of

could not be found, and she succeeded
thus in saving the lives of many.

TACOMA, Aug. 27.â A representative of
a Boston syndicate has just closed one of
the largest mining deals ever perfected in
the West;
The syndicate named, with a capital of
$3,500,030, becomes the owner of -22
placer mining claims in the Cover d'Alene
distil In Idaho. The claims are all lo
cated In Shoshone County along Prichard
and Eagle creeks and within the dis
trict where the recent miners' troubles
have attracted world wide attention.
Hiiliard and his associates have been
successful in securing several patented
claims held by operators and speculators
in and about Tacoma. The purchase of
these claims gives th, company control
of about 75 per cent of theiplacer diggings
In Idaho. The total investment is said to
be about $1,500
Arrangements are being perfected to
equip the property with a (750,000 dredg
ing and hydraulic plant. The most im
proved machinery and the latest methods
known to science will be employed in the
full development of all the properties.
Th, practical part of the work will be
under the management of B. Stanley
Revatt, a mining engineer who has long
been connected with the North American
sold Dredging Company of Colorado -and
the Continental Gold Dredging Company
n California. It was largely through his
recommendations, made after an ex
amination of Coeur d'Alene in .833 that
:he new company was formed and con
solidation made possible. For years these
ilaeer- mines were successfully worked,
md have been producing gold ever since.
The beginning of the new consolidation
was several months ago. when Hiiliard
aegan quietly to buy claims on Prichard
'rt-ek from Raven to the mouth of the
?reek. and on Eagle Creek. The whole of
this district, about twenty-three miles in
length, has been purchased and turned
over to the Boston syndicate.

home in Blackburn Gulch. In the early
days he was a sea captain and amassed
a considerable fortune. He was a native

the Valley road, and rested his head on
the track for a pillow. It Is claimed he
was drinking last night. He was 60 years
of age and an old employe of the road.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, AUGUST 28, 1899.
CRUISER BOSTON, SCARRED AND BLACKENED BY
MONTHS OF WAR
GENTLY tugging at the anchor that
holds her in her place amid the
placid waters of the bay rides a yes-
sel that has made history and helped
o change the map of the world. It is the
cruiser Boston, the vessel that opened the
May Hay festivities which signalized the
commencement of American power In the
Philippines. It is nearly four years now
since she was last seen in this harbor, and
she has greatly changed since then. When
she was here before she appeared to the
beholder as one of the most beautiful of
our modern ships of war, and she fairly
glistened with the paint and polish which
had been bestowed upon her to make her
look at her very best; and the square rig
ging which she carried aloft brought back
to mind the days when sailors fought
yardarm to yardarm with their enemies.
To-day, battered and soiled, she re
turned shorn of the delicate tracery of top
hamper and running gearâ a scarred old
veteran, soiled and ugly, but more be
loved than ever by the country whose flag
she flies.
Yesterday tugs were plying to and fro
from early morning until way into the
afternon carrying the great crowds of
visitors anxious to look at the guns that
had sent Montijo's ships to the bottom of
Manila Bay. The visitors were cordially
received by the men on board, and the
bluejackets seemed just as anxious to ex
hibit all there was of Interest as their
visitors were to behold and listen to the
stories of how the battle was won.
The objects which were lingered over
The objects which were lingered over
longest were the patches covering the
spots where Spanish shells had torn their
way through. There were live such places
altogether, one on the foremast, where a
shell had struck and then plunged onward
to explode over the side; one in the side.

The police are hopeful of connecting
Jack Casey, the Australian crook, with
the robbery of the specie room of the
j steamer Alameda.
Shortly after his arrest Saturday night
Detectives Gibson. Ellis and Sullivan.
who took him into custody, questioned
: him, but as he seemed dazed from the
effects of an overindulgence in liquor,
they decided to allow him to become
sober before putting him through the
! "sweating" process.
Yesterday morning he was taken before
Chief Lees and closely questioned. Casey
emphatically denied that he had a hand
in the Alameda robbery. He claimed he
! was in San Francisco at the time and
; that he did not leave the city until after
! tlie robbery was made public.
Casey also denied any participation in
the diabolical scheme to murder Million
i aire Green.
"If Howard put up the Job," he re
; marked with considerable emphasis, "I
know nothing about it. Howard, it is
I true, was my friend and I still regard
I him as such. So far as his dealings with
j Green were concerned I know nothing
I about them, as Howard was strangely
I uncommunicative even to his warmest
friends."
Casey, when asked about his partner,
I "Jimmie" Kelly, who is also suspected of
I being one of the Alameda robbers, de
! clared he had heard Kelly had died in
j New Orleans a short time ago. He ad
; mitted that after tae robbery was made
I known, thinking they were suspected, he
! and Kelly went East. He left i\.elly. so
he claimed, in New York, but expected to
! join him in New Orleans. On learning of
! Kelly's alleged death, he declared, he re
i turned to this city, intending to inform
the police that Kelly had "gone to a
higher court," as he expressed it.
Notwithstanding his statement the po
| lice are morally certain that Casey and
! Kelly, on learning that the detectives
were after them in connection with the
Alameda robbery, went to Howard and
were advised by him to leave the city.
From a reliable source the police have
learned that both Casey and Kelly were
in New Orleans and thinking tuat they
were being watched they agreed to sep
arate. Before leaving his companion in
crime Kelly concocted the scheme where-
by Casey was to circulate the story that
he was occupying six feet of earth in an
unmarked grave.
Casey returned to this city last Thurs-
day, but learning that the police were hot
on his trail he went into hiding. Late
Saturday night he ventured out and get-
ting gloriously full, he was picked up by
the detectives and taken to police head-
quarters.
The police think Kelly is also in this
â city, and every effort is being made to And
him. *;.*â â¢ .

sailors firmly attribute Dewey's victory.
the vessel is filled with parrots, monkeys,
birds of various sorts and a large assort

picked up at various ports or have been
born on board.
The vessel, which is under the com
mand of Lieutenant Commander Edward

til after Wednesday. Then she will go to
Mare Island, where she will be over

Labor Union Troubles.
SCRANTON, Pa., Aug. 27.â President
Parsons of the National Letter Carriers'
Association has protested to the local car
riers in permitting non-union carpenters
to build the arches and columns which
form the main features of the decorations
at the carriers' national convention, to be
held here next week.
He says that unless the mistake is rec
tified the big labor day parade is likely
to be disrupted, as the 1700 carriers from
New York City are disposed to refuse to
march under the arches. The local com
mittee has cent a reply to New York to
explain that the carpenter work was sub
let by an electrician who has the contract
for the decorations. _

Secret Work of the Com-
mission.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CHICAGO, Aug. 28.â special to
I the Tribune from Washington says: In
I spite of the apparent abandonment of
â  the negotiations with Canada, it is
j learned on the authority of an official
whose connection with the boundary
j question has been constant and confi
-1 dential that a secret agreement had
i been reached, as the result of which a
: temporary arrangement will be ac
\ complished before Congress meets in
! December.
As the result of negotiations conduct
ed in the utmost secrecy assurances
have been given the American Com
missioners, it is said, that if they will
allow matters to rest until after the
: Canadian elections in October a tempo
: rary agreement will be readily reached.
! It is suggested that the basis of the
I new modus Vivendi has been sketched
out and practically agreed upon by
! the American and Canadian Commis
sioners.
This temporary arrangement, or
! modus Vivendi, will provide, first, that
j the Canadians shall have the use of a
port on the Lynn Canal, Pyramid Har
bor being the most likely one. The ar
rangement will provide, however, by
means of a special protocol, a distinct
declaration that this temporary occu
pation of a port on the Lynn Canal by
British customs officers shall in no way
affect the final settlement of the bound-
ary question, but both British and
American interests and claims will be
fully reserved. The use of the port is
to be temporary until the question of
ownership of the disputed strip is final-
ly settled to the satisfaction of both
countries.
Under this temporary agreement also
Canadian white pine lumber, not dress

AMERICAN ON TRIAL
FOR MURDER IN JAPAN
YOKOHAMA. Aug. 11, via Victoria, B.
C. , Aug. 27.â The foreign community here
is watching with eager interest the first
murder trial of a foreigner in the Jap-
anese courts. Though there is no doubt
of the guilt of the accused; an American
named Miller, curiosity is greatly
strengthened by the opportunity thus
early given to note the rulings of the
Judge and the method of procedure. The
conduct of the trial has been exceedingly
dignified and fair, and in the opinion of a
leading foreign barrister will prove to be
far more efficient in securing a just ver
dict than could be possible under -the old
system. The promptness with which the
accused was brought to the bar and the
entire absence of any disposition to delay
the proceedings excites favorable com
ment and goes far toward allaying for
eign fears of Oriental dllatoriness.
Another assurance to the same effect
was given in the speedy trial and acquit
tal of the engineer of the United States
transport Sherman, arrested for larceny.
This case is notable as being the solitary
instance of police interference with any
one connected with the .American troops
passing through here. Five thousand
nave now come and gone, roaming through
the streets of Yokohama and Tokio for
an average of two days without causing a
ripple of disturbance.

Employer.
The police have been asked to find
I "Billy" McNess, who is wanted for the
j alleged embezzlement of about UOOO be
longing to Van Vliet, the pawnbroker, at
9 Grant avenue. McNess was a trusted
employe, and frequently handled large
sums of money belonging to the pawn
broker.
Some time ago he became infatuated
with a young woman whom he met at
the People's Palace and proposed
marriage to her. She readily accepted
the offer, but on account of the opposi
tion manifested by her parents, it was
agreed between them that they should
elope.
As 'McNess did not have the necessary
cash, it is claimed, he helped himself to
the funds "of his employer and then de-
parted with his sweetheart for Seattle.
As the girl insisted that they should be
married, McNess took her before a
Seattle Justice of the Peace, where they
were made man and wife.
Learning that Van Vliet has enlisted
the secvices of the police in apprehending
his former clerk, McNess, evidently fear-
ing arrest, went to Denver, but through
a letter which he wrote to a friend in
this city, the police located him and It is
expected that an officer will be sent to
bring him back.
McNess was a familiar figure on Market
street and was looked upon as a model
young man.
Louis Van Vliet is loth to communicate
anything in regard to the alleged defalca
tion .of his trusted clerk. He admitted
the robbery, but stated that he must see
his brother before giving any further in
formation.
"Did McNess rob you of $1000?" he was
asked last night. .
"No, not that much," he replied.
Van Vliet said he could not tell the
exact amount he had lost without con-
sulting his books. He stated that he had
never suspected that there was anything
wrong with McNess, but had trusted him
absolutely until his defalcation. He
would make no further statement con-
cerning the affair.

NOTHING EVER SEEN LIKE IT.
IT is a queer kind of prosperity that throws men
out of work, but such is the condition of things
in one or two lines of trade to-day. The demand
for finished iron products is so immense that the fur
naces have not been able to turn out the goods fast
enough to fill their orders, so in seveial branches of
the industry men have had to be laid off until suffi
cient supplies can be secured. In fact, nothing like the
present trade activity has ever been seen in this coun
try. It began a year or so ago, and was thought to be
the natural reaction after a long period of depression,
which would subside after a few months; but it still
continues, and is even more pronounced than last
year.
Current figures show this tremendous activity plain-
Current figures show this tremendous activity plain
ly. The tonnage movement from Chicago during the
past three weeks has been 80 per cent heavier than last
year, and 74.6 per cent heavier than in 1892, the year
preceding the panic. The bank clearings of the coun
try have exhibited a marked gain every week this
year, sometimes running up to 80 per cent over [898.
Every week, too, the failures have been smaller than
for the same week last year. The gratifying feature 'of
all this prosperity is that it is accompanied by very
little speculation, being, in fact, "the result of an enor
mous demand for goods all over the United States.
This demand is strikingly illustrated in the clothing
trade, leading clothiers reporting that the people are
not only buying more clothes than for a long time,
but are buying a more expensive class of fabrics.
There can be no better proof of widespread prosperity
than this.
The weekly commercial reports last week abounded
in illustrations of the unprecedented demand for mer
chandise of all descriptions. Iron and steel, notwith
standing the recent advances, continue 10 point up
ward under an inquiry fully as eager as at any time
during the past year, while lumber, wool, leather,
boots and shoes, cotton and most of the other staples
rule firm at full figures. Practically all the industries
are some months behind the requirements for actual
use. and in not a few the output for a year ahead has
been sold. The fall demand is showing remarkable
expansion, particularly in the Northwest, while the
great corn belt of the West is in high feather over an
enormous crop at fair prices. The only drawback at
present is a drought in the Southwestern cotton
States, notably Texas. The cattle raisers are in
clover, for present prices for beef have been equaled
in Chicago only five times in twenty-two years, and
there are 10,000,000 less beef cattle in the United
States than there were seven years ago. In fact, it
is said that there are fewer cattle in the country now
than since 1882. Certainly, it is long since prices for
beef and mutton have been as high as they are now,
while hogs keep up to 6c in the San Francisco mar
ket with a pertinacity which surprises the packers.
All these conditions tell the tale of the current pros
perity. We seem to be in one of these epochs familiar
to readers of history, when the land seems flowing
with milk" and honey. On this coast the principal
expression of the prevailing good times is the lack
of farm hands to harvest the grain and fruit crops.
This complaint has been heard ever since the harvest
began, and is something unique in agriculture.
Wages have advanced' in proportion, but the prices
of most farm products are now so good that the
farmer is making more money at the high labor rate
than he did when he was getting men for very low
pay. '.- .y
When business is so active, both in city and coun
try, it is difficult to point out' where the principal
activity lies. Suffice it to say that not for many years
has trade been in such satisfactory condition as now;
.md the best feature of it is that it is likely to continue
so indefinitely. . -:-
The hide of Holocaust, .the French horse that Tod
Sloan rode to its death in the English Derby, has been
tanned and will be made into boots for fashionable
London. It goes without saying that purchasers will
be found in the fast set.
A sound like unto that made by a cow drawing her
hoof out of the mud was heard plainly the other day
in Washington. Thomas Brackett Reed was pulling
cut of Congress.
BUSINESS SENSE IN THE SOUTH.
PERMANENT organization was recently effected
in Atlanta by an association of business men
known as the Southern Industrial League, the
| objects of which are to encourage the payment and
j collection of debts, to repeal statutes devised to hinder
j the collection of debts, to protect all forms of invested
; capital and to prevent the discounting of debts.
The organization of a league for such purposes
I throws a strong side light upon business conditions
j of the Southern States and reveal some of the causes
j why the South has been so backward in commercial
j and industrial development. In the wreck of the old
, slavcholding society in the South there fell upon that
section so much of disaster that discontent became the
dominant sentiment of the people, and the quack
legislators, who flourish everywhere in periods' of
popular discontent, obtained such power they were
enabled to fill the statute books with laws ostensibly
| designed to protect debtors, but which might be fairly
I termed acts to destroy credit. By making it difficult
j to collect debts these States have made it difficult for
: their people to borrow money, and as a consequence,
! while the rest of the Union has ample financial re-
sources to promote industry and trade, the South has
- been in a condition of chronic financial stringency.
The intelligent business men of the South now per-
ceive the evil that has been brought upon them by
this. "fool legislation"' and have organized to repeal it.
At the meeting at which the permanent organiza
; tion was effected the principal speaker was S. G. Mc-
Lendon of Thomasville, Georgia, and in the course
of his address he gave the South much good advice
in matters of national as well as of State legislation.
Commenting upon the support given to Bryan and
free silver he said:
"Congress never did. never will, and never can
| regulate the value of a single piece of money made
j out of metal or paper, except in payment of taxes and
executions. The unwritten laws of commerce regulate
these, and all other values. To reduce it down to a
unit, the buyer and the seller are the only people
on earth who are possessed of final and absolute power
I to regulate values, and Parliaments and Kings and
Congresses are utterly helpless in the presence
jof the power of these . two persons. ****â¢*â¢
When we of the South take our stand against our
own and the experience of other nations, and join in
1 an effort to uphold this ancient and exploded theory,
we assume a burden that reduces our credit, paralyzes
our resources and retards our development."
Equally pertinent was his condemnation of the pro-
posed indiscriminate legislation against trusts. On
I that question he said:
"I do not defend trusts, but I do insist that the peo
â  ple have a right to ask that the, criminal or evil trusts
be named and their crimes specified before they are
invited to an indiscriminate slaughter of all corpora-
tions created under State laws. The laws against re-
grating, forestalling and engrossing sleep calmly in
the statute books of many of our States, but how one
sovereign in forty-five is going to dictate the conduct
of another sovereign, or how the Federal Govern
| ment is going to acquire jurisdiction over franchises
. granted by the State, or over the States which grant
them, are questions upon which the anti-trust orators
and press have so far given out no information. Until
an intelligent indictment against offending trusts is
i framed and presented to the great assize of the people
no progress will be made toward the suppression of
an alleged evil."
Finally Mr. McLendon closed with a general coun
sel that will be profitably studied not only in the
: South but throughout the Union:
"In our haste for remedial legislation we often see
the wrong man hit. We are groaning to-day under
1 the heavy burden of statesmanship which introduces
' laws which can in no way be administered. Let the
people awake and scourge such men from public
office. Let them awake and suppress that school
which would teach that government can usurp the
< functions of the Almighty and create something out
of nothing. Let them awake and quit levying public
j taxes for private profit. Let them awake and require
j that only just and reasonable laws shall be enacted,
; and that these shall be promptly and impartially ad
! ministered by the courts. Let the people do these
things, and our burdens will be lifted, the idle hand
t and the idle dollar will meet under the banner of equal
: laws, and while giving employment to each other
will give prosperity to our country."
TRUST CONFERENCES.
SOME time ago Governor Sayers of Texas issued
a. call for a convention of Governors and At-
torneys General of the States and Territories
! to meet in St. Louis September 20, to devise a uni
; form system of laws for the regulation of trusts. A
j little later the Civic Federation of Chicago arranged
j for a conference on trusts to assemble in that city
1 September 13, and the Governors of the States have
i been requested to appoint delegates to attend it.
The two conferences will differ widely from one
another in the attitude they assume toward the subject
under consideration. That which meets in St. Louis
j has been called "to consider the effect which the for
-1 mation of trusts is having upon the country, and, if
! possible, to agree upon a character of legislation that
will not only force those now existing into dissolu
tion, but will also prevent their further creation."
The attitude of such a convention it will be seen is
one of hostility to trusts and its main object is to
devise a means for preventing their operation..
The Chicago conference, according to the call of
i the Civic Federation, is "to discuss combinations and
: trusts, their uses and abuses, embracing the subjects
of transportation, labor, industrial and commercial
j combinations.''' The object of this conference, there-
I fore, is purely educational; it will aim to present all
I sides of the issue impartially and will consider upon
its merits every problem involved.
After the Chicago conference. had been called the
committee of arrangements discovered that while
there has been much -discussion on the subject there
has been very little reliable data brought forward
upon which to base conclusions. To remedy that de
! feet the committee has issued blanks to upward of
1 20,000 persons, firms and corporations, more or less
1 affected by trusts, asking for replies to questions per
j tinent to the controversy. By means of these replies
j the committee expects to be able to compile a larger
; fund of information on the subject of trusts and their
i effects than has yet been furnished.
Of the two conferences, that at Chicago promises
jto be the more interesting. A considerable number
i of Governors and Attorneys General have accepted
' the invitation to the St. Louis meeting and it will
doubtless be well attended, but the results are not
! likely to be profitable. At the utmost it can only
; agree upon some declamatory resolutions denouncing
trusts, more useful for stump speakers in the cam
j paigns of the fall than for intelligent legislators seek-
ing to devise laws for the good of their common-
wealths.
From the Chicago conference, on the other hand.

may be needed to regulate them and guard against
abuses. In fact if the anti-trust Governors and At
torneys General who are going: to the convention st
St. Louis are wise, they will attend the Chicago con:
ference first and learn something of both sides of the

THE EAST AND THE WEST.
ACCORDING to a report from Washington,
; one of the most serious obstacles in the way
of procuring governmental aid for the irriga
tion of arid districts of the West is the opposition of
Eastern interests. It is said many people in that sec
tion of the Union regard the development of the West
as in some measure prejudicial to Eastern farmers
inasmuch as it will tend to diminish the value of farm
lands and the prices of farm products.
A prominent leader of one of the Eastern granges
is quoted as saying he could see nothing in the way
of results from irrigation under the supervision and
by the aid of the national Government but a local
benefit to the West, and that he did not think it right
for the people of the whole country to be taxed for
the purpose of helping a few sparsely settled arid
States.
It is of course inevitable that some sectional oppo-
I sition to the vast work of irrigation should develop.
1 It is true that the Eastern States do not need irriga-
I tion and that if the national Government undertake
the work of constructing great storage reservoirs,
the Eastern as well as the Western taxpayer will have
j tt. assist in defraying the cost. The issue is therefore
a sectional one, but it is not more so than any other
I wcrk of internal improvement. When the interior of
the country is taxed to provide revenues for the im
provement of harbors on the coast, the residents of.
the coast cities can easily perceive the improvement
I is for the general good, but when it is proposed to
I improve the interior of the country some Atlantic
Coast people see nothing in it but a movement for a
\ purely Western benefit.
Fortunately it is not likely. that merely sectional
considerations will have much weight in determining
the action of the Government on an issue of this kind.
It is true that almost every river and harbor bill and
every bill providing for the construction of post
offices is made up largely by an interchange of favors
between the members of Congress from the different
districts that are to be benefited, but in measures
dealing with large matters there is very little sectional
] ism displayed. When a comprehensive irrigation
{ policy has been given definite form and comes up for
action, the leaders of Congress, the directing states
men of the nation, will not give much heed to ob
j jections interposed on sectional grounds.
The fact that some sectional opposition exists
! ought, however, to arouse the people of the West to
the importance of making a united effort to bring
the issue fairly before the nation and to educate the
East upon the advantage which the whole people will
derive from the upbuilding of the semi-arid section
of the Union. The problems of irrigation on the vast
scale required to redeem the arid and semi-arid re
gions cannot be adequately dealt with by any power
less than that of the national Government, and he is
but a narrow-minded American who can see in such
i redemption nothing but a local benefit for the dis
tricts where the irrigation will be supplied.
A DEMOCRATIC ELI WANTED.
WHILE Bryan has been sweeping one Demo-
cratic State convention after another into the
old stampede for free silver, the conservative
Democrats are still puffing and panting in the race
after the wild crowd trying to get them back into the
old road. They are making the race with a persis
tency worthy of their cause, and loud are their shouts
to one another, "Get there, Eli, and head them
steers."
William F. Harrity. who has been for some time at
Saratoga talking politics with aristocratic Democrats
from all parts of the country, declares the prevailing
feeling among them is a desire to get rid of Bryan
and bring about a reunion of the party. He says:
"The uppermost thought in the minds of those whom
I casually met was the hope that the Democratic
National Convention of iooo would pursue such a
conservative course that all Democrats and citizens
generally of independent tendencies might cordially
and enthusiastically support the platform and the can
didate."
Similar expressions come from other sources. The
Nashville American recently said: "Mr. Bryan has
unquestionably lost strength with many thinking men
in the South, not only because free coinage has lost
prestige, but because of his indefinite position regard
ing expansion and his weak handling of the trust
question." '
The Philadelphia Times, an independent Democratic
paper, says: "Many of the Democratic leaders be
paper, says: "Many of the Democratic leaders be
lieve, or pretend to believe, that Mr. Bryan will be
lieve, or pretend to believe, that Mr. Bryan will be
renominated as the Democratic candidate for Presi
dent next year, but. fearful and suicidal as have been
the Democratic follies of the past, there is little like
the Democratic follies of the past, there is little like
lihood that the next Democratic National Convention
will select a candidate for President who would be
known from start to finish as the leader of an utterly
known from start to finish as the leader of an utterly
forlorn hope."
From East and West and North and South come
reports of that kind. There is a prevalent desire for
reports of that kind. There is a prevalent desire for
harmony among such Democrats as , can afford to

A WEEK'S TALES FROM
THE MINING FIELD
The attendance and enthusiasm at the
annual convention of the El Dorado
County Miners' Association at Placer
ville on Saturday evening shows that the
life and the enterprising spirit of the
mining regions are increasing with the
growing mining prosperity. Other county
conventions will early follow, and there
is every promise of Secretary Benjamin
of the California Miners' Association
meeting with great success in his efforts
to stimulate the increase of membership
in the county associations and so further
strengthen the State: association, which
is composed of these federated county
organizations.
A lucky tenderfoot has struck it rich in
the woods about six miles west of old
Fruitvale, Shasta County, in section 3,
township, 33 north, range 2 west, and ere-
ated a rush to the new diggings. A week
or two before James Wilson and wife of
Oakland struck out north for a health
vacation and wisely decided to go far
from the Southern Pacific and close to
nature. They traveled the Fall River
road tor twenty-five miles from Redding
to the old Ben Jenkins place and then
they followed the Ridge road for miles
until they found a deserted old cabin and
settled in it with joy and canned goods.
Mr. and Mrs. Wilson were not after gold,
they knew nothing about mining and no-
body knew anything- about gold being in
those parts. No experienced prospector
was ever fool enough to dig on section 3,
and the old miner who left the cabin long
ago used to strike out over a trail north
by northeast to hills worth exploring.
Wilson decided, however, to be a miner
for a few minutes as well as a fisherman
and child of nature, and took a pick and
shovel and told Mrs. Wilson that he was
going to be a prospector until supper was
ready. He went about 100 yards from the
cabin, keeping, in reach of the supper
voice, and went to digging in an easy
place. As the Redding Searchlight says:
"AÂ£ter working for a quarter of an hour
he struck a small boulder, and throwing
it out of the way, a bed of sparkling gold
I quartz was revealed. Then the novice
I miner, who had struck gold before he had
i started the perspiration, called his wife
j and an Impromptu celebration was held
! upon the spot. The gold stood out in little
clusters. Wilson proceeded to develop his
1 property and found the pocket, if such' it
is, to be extensive. On the day follow-
ing the discovery over $200 was taken
out. Mrs. Wilson brought specimens of
the quartz to Redding, and its unusual
richness is apparent at a glance. How
â  much gold she and her husband have
j taken out the lady did not state, but it
j has already reached a handsome sum.
"People living in the vicinity have
learned of the rich find, and all the
country thereabout is being plastered
with location notices. More than thirty
claims have been located in the vicinity
of the place where the Wilsons made
their strike. Indications of gold, silver
and copper are said to abound."
Many cemeteries here and there, in the
gold mining regions have seen the peace
of the dead disturbed by gold diggers.
Every mountain hamlet has Its little city
of the dead near by, and here and there
these consecrated acres contain gold
enough to pay for working. In some
cases hydraulic miners have come along
with their big flumes and giants and gone
to working the surrounding ground.
Sometimes the bones have been moved to
a patch of ground that could be better
spared to the departed miners by the
live ones, and in some cases the sur
j rounding ground has been sluiced away
! to the line of the cemetery fence, leaving
high and deep banks from which, with
the wear of weather and time, coffins
! would later stick out, overhanging the
i bedrock reached below. One of these au
riferous cemeteries so treated is at
Trinity Center on the upper Trinity
River, where the rest of the deep river
beach has been worked on all sides, leav-
ing a square block of ground thirty or
forty feet high that looms up with raw,
red sides from miles away. There are
others elsewhere that have been so let
alone. * '.-'"â¢
Other rich cemeteries have had other
troubles, and there Is one up at Colum
bia. Tuolumne County, that has just been
saved by Father Cuerin. who wants to
let the gold rest there under the dead
where the Almighty put it. It seems that
the bedrock in that Catholic cemetery
some distance below the marble crosses
is quite rich, the pay dirt in which the
dead are entombed going sometimes
several dollars to the pan. Joseph
Morris and James Hambleton, although
they had not yet acquired claims in the
burying ground, proceeded some time ago
to "run a tunnel drift out into the pay
dirt and were Stopped. Then they went
-to stealthily doing their tunneling at
night and kept it up for several nights
until their ghastly trespassing was dis-
covered and put a stop to last week by
the good priest in control of the ground.
In the past the adjoining ground was
worked so close to the cemetery that the
fence was undermined. The County Sur
veyor last week staked out the boundaries
of* the consecrated ground and gold dig-
gers will be kept out of it until they have
no more use for nuggets.
There is a little gold excitement in the
mountains in the # interior of Santa Bar
bara County, where there was one three
or four years ago. Last week the County
Recorder received four location notices
by mail from Guadalupe and recorded
them. As location notices are now an
important subject of discussion, the
form of one of these may be of interest.
It is as follows: -'-*- - -r
"Xi PUCK June 16 I*oo

There are a great number of mining
j men in Eos Angeles at the present
; time., says the Los Angeles Times. Many
i of them are here on business connected
i with Southern California properties,
; some buying supplies for their own prop-
erties, others on their way north or
south; others, again, are here with their
; families, taking advantage of the less in
tense heat as compared with that which
usually prevails in other sections at this
period of the year. The majority of them
express the desire to learn more of the
mineral resources of this part of Cali
fornia, and manifest surprise when told
of the number of mines that are being
worked and the value of the metals and
minerals taken out. -\i , 1 â

The volunteer souvenir edition of The San Francisco Call, which was issued
Thursday, is one of the prettiest pieces of newspaper work that has come to our
tables for a long time. The taste, ability and good sense displayed in getting lt up
does credit not only to The Call, but to Pacific Coast journalism. The horrible
mixture of dirty yellow and glaring red which is becoming a part of the special
editions of many of our metropolitan contemporaries was lacking, and although a
negative features it was one of the most praiseworthy connected with the effort.

which was announced the arrival of the First California heroes. The issue was
really a magnificent one and head and shoulders above anything from any of the
other metropolitan presses on that day.

The Lightner, says the Stockton Inde-
pendent, is the latest mine to attract at-
tention in the mountains near by, the sec-
ond twenty stamps having been started
a few days ago, making forty stamps to
pound up the big vein that is known to
hold out to a depth of nearly 500 feet.
Commencing September lst work will be
rushed on a contract to sink 200 feet deep-
er in the Lightner, and there is no fear
that the vein will not hold out as the
shaft is sunk. So far the mine has de-
veloped better as depth was reached, and
there Is reason to believe the property
will prove one of the best paying deep
mines of the mother lode section in Cal-
averas, barring only the Gwin.
A company is being formed for the pur-
pose of dredging the Tuolumne river be-
tween Roberts Ferry and La Grange for
gold. It is believed that the river channel
has fine gold in paying quantities, and
rights are being obtained for the purpose
of dredging the river. By the process
proposed the debris and gravel in the
river will be dredged and run through
flumes and re-emptied into the river. The
dredging will be done with buckets that
will raise a ton of slickens, which will be
run through a flume on the boat, which is
to be about 60 feet long, and then returned
to the river. Several of the rights have
already been secured and enough ground
will be reserved before the company start
in to justify the large outlay of money re-
quired to give the mining a thorough test.

$1000 was paid down by the bonders and
agreements were signed calling for the
payment of $1000 every six months until !

only about two miles from town. These
mines are on the footwall belt of the

nently mentioned by mining men for years
because of their location in respect of the

forts have been made by promoters and j

received $27,500 and the promoters of the

her speed, while it falls short of thirty
knots, as British boats of that class are

The new British battleship Ocean expe
rienced some difficulties before she was
able to proceed with her regular steam
trials. During a preliminary trial her
bearings became overheated and had to
be overhauled, and then her steering gear
was discovered to be out of order. On
August 2 the ship passed through the
first series of trials, with the following
results: Thirty hours under one-fifth
powerâsteam, 210 pounds; revolutions,
66.8; horsepower, 2767; speed, 11.4 knots:
coal consumption, at' the rate of 184
pounds, per - horsepower per hour. The
ship is fitted with twenty Belleville boilers
of the latest improvement, the tubes of
which are of solid drawn steel ranging
from 4% to 2% inches in diameter, and gal
vanized externally. The heating surface
is 35,715 square feet and the grate surface
1035 square feet. Under full power the
machinery is to develop 13.500 horsepow
er, giving a speed of 18% knots. The steam
trials include: First, a preliminary trial
at sea; second, thirty hours' continuous
steaming under one-fifth pressure; third,
thirty hours' steaming under three-fifths
power; fourth, eight hours under full
power.
London Engineering compares the Brit
ish armored cruiser Cressy, in course of
construction, with the Asama, of a similar
type, built at Elswick for the Japanese
navy. It would apear from a comparison
of the data as if the Elswick builders
manage to design highly efficient ships
upon displacements considerably less than
are required by the British admiralty. The
relative dimensions and other data of the
two ships are as follows:
~
â¢Quick firing.
The Cressy has a water line belt six
inches thick, which, however, does not ex
tend all around, while the Amasa's belt,
of seven-inch maximum thickness, ex
tends from stem to stern, tapering to
three inches at the ends. The Cressy's
citadel armor is six inches, the Amasa's
five Inches. Thus 0n.9700 tons Elswick
builds a faster and heavier aVmed ship
than the British admiralty produce on
12,000 tons. The discrepancy is so great
as to be accounted for only in the possible
fact that the supply of ammunition is
much greater to each gun in the British
ship than that allotted to the Japanese.

age a golden age better than any one has
ever hoped for, that will make the world

to be here."

SOUTHERN LYNCHINGS.
Rev. T. Brown Discusses the Negro
Outrages and Their Solution at
A. M. E. Zion Church.
Rev. T. Brown delivered a strong ser
mon on the recent outrages in the South
and the solution of the race question at
A. M. E. Zion Church last night. He said
in brief:
"Since there is no law by which the
lynchers of the land can be punished,
and since public sentiment has become
30 biased on the question of justice to all
American citizens, the question of the
law of necessity can legally be raised.
There is not a nationality on the face of
the civilized globe which does not In
some way indicate to the negro that they
are his superiors. Such is the outgrowth
of the greatest age in the world's his
tory-
"Lynching has become a mania with
the American people. Guilty or not guilty,
lynching must be done. My heart goes
out to all who suffer the fate of lynching
or other injustice. But another day will
come. Let us wait on the Lord and on
him alone."

yesterday morning. He said in part:
"Whoever understands well the para

not help admitting that among the many
gifts lavished by God's infinite goodness
on His Intelligent creatures here below
there is none more precious in its char

more beneficial in its results than the gift
of supernatural divine Catholic faith. In
fact, even in this nineteenth century of
ours, with all its progress of modern civ
ilization in every sphere of secular learn

what, I ask, should we know, for In

OUR GALLANT FIRST
EXTROLLED BY A
PATRIOTIC PULPIT
THE home-coming of the First Cali
fornia Regiment was the theme of
many eloquent discourses ln the
churches of San Francisco yesterday.
Pulpits resounded with tributes to the
valor of the volunteers and lessons were
. drawn from their eagerness to defend
I Old Glory. The magnificent spectacle
witnessed during the past week was
dwelt on at length, as was also the senti
ments which actuated the citizens of this
State to enter into such an elaborate re
; ception to the returning heroes. In many
i of the churches patriotic music waa ren
; dered in honor of the occasion.

DONE FOR, OUR BOYS
DO.NE FOR OUR BOYS
"The Home Coming of the Boys" was
' the subject of an able sermon yesterday
; morning by the Rev. Herbert N. Bevier.
\ In part he said:
California In general and the city ln parti
j cular has been mightily swayed by sentiment
during the past week. Sentiment has opened
hearts and purse strings. Sentiment has Illu
â¢ minated our Etreets -with bright lighting ; given
[ us an evening in Venice, and in so doing pro
duced some of the moat noble night pictures
j the land has ever seen. Sentiment has woven
garlands of holly and olive; turned thorough
fares into boulevards by borrowing of the firs
and the palms; made suppers and twined flow
ers and given the boys who went to war a
homecoming worthy of the uame. California
resolved that no State should outdo her in the
magnificence and splendor of her welcome and
has magnificently kept her resolve.
Sentiment has kept the whole State on the
tiptoe of expectancy for the arrival of a cer
tain ship. San Francisco has ships come and
go every hour of the day, yet this ship has
been so eagerly watched for that news of her
arrival by ordinary process could not answer
for our eagerness. No, we must send an elec
tric impulse from the heart of the ocean across
seven miles of boiling sea to tell our people
that the ship had been sighted, and. when
sighted, half the city most go to boats and the
other half to the hilltops to express their Joy.
Love of home and the homeland, gratitude and
gregation at St. Francis Church. The
pastor spoke on the "Consecration of
Christendom to the Sacred Heart." He
said:
To consecrate an object is to set lt apart and
devote it to some sacred purpose. When you
consecrate yourselves to the sacred heart of
our Lord you set apart, as lt were, and devote
yourself to Its love, homage and adoration.
Excellent music was rendered by the
choir, which consists of the following
members: Mrs. B. F. Sides, Miss Vlautln,
A. F. Woodbridge and T. G. Walsh.
In the evening Father McDonnell
preached to a crowded congregation on
"Devotion to the Sacred Heart."
AT THE PARK AND CLIFF.
Contrary to Expectations Soldiers
Were Not Much in Evidence.
Although the people were tired and full
of sightseeing after viewing the splendid
pageant in honor of California's boys
home from the Philippines, they gathered
again at the park and other recreation
places yesterday. Doubtless many of the
many crowds anticipated an opportunity
of seeing the boys out of parade and pos
sible opportunities of conversing with
them regarding their experiences on the
firing line, but they were disappointed.
The boys perhaps preferred to rest yes
terday. In any event they were not
much in evidence.
During the past week there were re
ceived at the Park Museum two splendid
models inVstucco of the giant octopus or
cuttlefish, made and presented by Pro
fessor Ward of Rochester, N. Y. These
models are life-size and caused consider
able interest and comment. Thomas
Hevdenfeldt of 1040 Post street has do
nated a collection of ethnological speci
mens made and used by the natives of
the Philippines. There are twenty-eight
pieces in the collection, and, owing to the
present war, the specimens attracted
considerable attention.
The usual interested crowd assembled
at the Chutes yesterday. The new illu
sion and the ever-entertaining Zoo,
coupled with the many other attractions,
served their purpose and the crowd en
joyed the day. Adgie and her lions are
on the bill for next week.
Many people watched the sport at
Sutro Baths. Following are the results
of the aquatic contests: 50-yard dash
(novice), F. Neal, Al Cook: 100-yard dash
(juvenile). H. Seebach, A. Smith; 100-yard ,

Victim of Ptomaine Poisoning In-
terred in Masonic Cemetery. .
The Interment of the remains of Mrs.
Jane L. Dunn, whose sudden death last
i Wednesday shocked a large circle of
i friends and prostrated the members of
[ her family, took place yesterday in Ma
sonic Cemetery. Mrs. Dunn's death was
caused by eating overripe muskmelon. in
which deadly ptomaines were found when
an examination was made after her de
mise, j . _ .
As president and one of the most popu
lar members of the Forum Society, Mrs.
Dunn wielded a wide influence. She was
a deep student in social affairs and a
i woman of many charities and numbered
! warm friends by, the score. These at
i tended the funeral services- yeserday,
I which were held at the family residence,
! 1218 Hyde street. The services were of
the simplest character. At the request of
the family there were no flowers, save
those which her fellow club members in-
sisted upon bringing.
The members of the Forum Club attend
ed in a body and accompanied the funeral
, cortege to the grave. MrÂ«. Dunn left a
| husband and two sons and one daughter
* to mourn her loss.
A. Chinawoman Commits Suicide.
Chew Deck, a Cninawoman residing at

day forenoon with a piece of cloth, which
she made fast to a board, tying the
other end about her neck. It was stated
to the Coroner's deputies that the woman
had for some time been sligthly dement
ed. Otherwise no cause appeared why
she should seek her own life. Her body
was removed to the Morgue.
He Did Not See the Procession.
August Shoenfeld, a grocer, residing at
18 Clara street, while making prepara
tions to take his family to see Saturday
night's procession, fell in a faint at his
store. He lingered until yesterday fore
noon, when he died. His death was re
ported to the Coroner's offlce and his
body removed to the Morgue. Deceased

SOLDIER'S PROMI.NE.NT
. PLJICE m .HISTORY
Rev. William Rader. pastor of the Third
Congregational Church, delivered an able
sermon last night on "The Soldier." His
text was Second Timothy iv:7â "I have
fought a good fight. I have finished my
course. I have kept the faith." He said:
The soldier occupies a prominent place ln
The soldier occupies a prominent place ln
history. In Rome Caesar is as great as Cicero:
in England Cromwell is as great as Beacons
field and In our own country no name in let
ters outshines the names of Grant and Dewey.
The Bible Is full of great soldiers. During the
past week our city has been profoundly stirred
by the return of the California Volunteers. The
greeting given this regiment equals that given
Napoleon on his return to Parts, the German
army in Berlin and the grand review In Wash
ington after the war. San Francisco made
history last week.
The speaker then developed the quali
| ties of the soldier as they apply to life.
â¢ and spoke upon sacrifice, obedience and
I courage, saying that the price of all vic
| tory, whether in the life of the nation or
! the individual, was battle.
SY.MPJn\HY FOR
WEEPIES MOTHERS
Rev. J. George Gibson of the Emmanuel
Baptist Church yesterday morning deliv
ered a sermon on "The Weeping Moth
ers," parts of which brought tears to the
eyes of his congregation. He chose his
text from Judges v:23â mother
looked out at a window and cried, "Why-
Is his chariot so long in coming?' " In
part he said:
A mother's love is the greatest thing In the
world. She loves her boy when he ls fighting
on the right side, and she still loves him when
in the estimation of others he fights on the
wrong side. Love is superior to political con
siderations. To-day while thousands are re
joicing It seems right that we should bow our
heads and whisper words of sympathy into the
ears of those fond mothers whose sons will
never return.
War is a terrible thing. Every victory brings
sorrow to some hearts. In San Francisco to
day and in Spain there are white faces watch
ing the Joyous procession and weary lips ask
ing, "Why does my boy not come back?" War
is a rough, rough way of putting things right,
a way of sorrow. The. mother love reminds us
that In human nature there is still much of
the divine. The mothers of our land and the
mothers of the other land bend over their dead
and love them because they were brave.
It ls woman's work to wait and be disap
pointed more than man's. It is easier to go
and fight than stay at home and watt. It re
quires less courage to go Into the busy world
and work than it does to step aside and wait.
Men work, women wait. I would rather work.
They are waiting for us ln the day time when
we return heme, and at night they wait on us
when we are sick. What wonder if the anx
ious look gets Into their faces.
And these waiting mothers amid all the Joys
SURPRISE AT
FIRST CHURCH
An Interesting Wedding to
Be Followed by a Ter
n Parting.
At the First Congregational Church last
evening Miss Lulu Snider, daughter of
Mrs. Andrew Snider and sister of Miss
Charlotte Beckwith, who is so delight-
fully associated with the Tivol Opera
Company in the minds of local theater
goers, became the bride of Spencer J.
Johnson Jr. The ceremony was performed
by the Rev. George C. Adams, ln the
presence of the entire congregation.
The announcement made by Mr. Adams
at the colse of the services last night that
he had been commissioned to invite the
congregation to remain and witness a
wedding was the first Intimation that
many of Miss Snider's friends had that
she had selected that as her wedding
day. The date was originally fixed for.
the 17th of September, but Air. Johnson,
l who Is inspector for the Continental In
surance Company, and who is prominent
in business circles in Chicago, received an
unexpected telegram last Friday sum-
moning him to that city. It was on. that
account that the wedding was hastened.
Miss Snider, who for the past few
months has occupied the position of lead-
ing soprano in the First Congregational
Church, was in her usual place In the or
gan loft last evening.
i After Mr. Adams' announcement she
I descended to the chancel rail, accom
panied by her bridesmaid, Miss Laura
Meigs. Here she was met by the groom,
attended by Dr. W. S. Porter, who acted
as best man. The bride was attired in a
gray "going away' gown, with velvet
toque to match.
Immediately after the service supper
was served at the home of the bride's
mother, 1317 Leavenworth street. The
house was tastefully decorated with red
roses, waving ferns and huckleberry
branches. In the dining room the na
! tional colors were prominent, two im
mense American flags forming a canopy
in the large bay window. The table was
trimmed with red carnations, placed there
by Miss Beckwh.i's loving hands, and at
each plate was a dainty favor of red,
white and blue.
Mr. Johnson will leave for the East to
night, where he will be Joined a month
later by his bride. Chicago will be their
future home. -.

are sad to-day. Their sons are not with the
returning heroes. The Golden Gate for them
was far away beyond the confines of earth.
They do not have the poor privilege of looking
on the upturned face and the folded hands.
And still they wait, unable to convince them
selves that their boys will never return.
"GOD BLESS YOU,
BRAVE SOLDIERS"
In closing his sermon on "The Enemies
of the Home," last evening Rev. Charles
Edward Locke of the Central Methodist
Episcopal Church said:
I cannot close this discussion on the home
j circle without assuring the noble boys of the
i California Regiment of our sincere delight in
j receiving them home, safe anil well. We have
been Justly proud of your patriotism, self-sacri
fice and valor and during these long months
you have been continually in our love and
prayers. As you have been welcomed into the
I State and city, so we welcome you into our
: temple and homes. May God bless you and
; make you brave citizens because of your ex-
I perience in real war. There are great battles
to be fought in these days at home and we
I ask you to help us in the conflicts of peace.

theme yesterday morning. His subject

part he said:
During the past year we have all been pro
foundly moved by national and international
Issues. No one that loved his country could
be disinterested. A sorry citizen is he whose
soul has not been stirred during the past week.
Patriotism is not only a civic virtue, it is
Christian duty. But is there, after all, any
current event to be compared with the tragedy
on Gol^atha? or any happening that can so
profoundly concern us as the revelation of
I God's mercy to our souls?

him, diagnosed his case as a temporary
rush of blood to the head.

Sick Women a. Advised to Seek

[LETTER TO MR3. PINKHAM NO. 94,863]
"I had inflammation and falling
I of the womb, and inflammation of
i ovaries, and was in great pain. I took
' medicine prescribed by a physician,
! but it did me no good. At last I heard
of Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Com-

am thankful to say I am a well women.
I I would advise all suffering women to
seek advice of Mrs. Pinkham." â Mrs.

" For several years my health was
V For several years my health was
miserable.' I suffered the most dread-
ful pains, and was almost on the verge
of insanity. I consulted one of the
best physicians in New York, and he
i pronounced my disease a fibroid tumor,
advising an operation without delay,
saying that it was my only chance for
life. Other doctors prescribed strong
and violent medicine, and one said I
was incurable, another told me my
only salvation was galvanic batteries,
which I tried, but nothing relieved me.
One day a friend called and begged me
to try Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable
Compound. I began its use and took
I several bottles. From the very first
i bottle there was a wonderful change
I for the better. The tumor has disap-
peared entirely and my old spirits have
returned. I heartily recommend your
i medicine to all suffering women." â

Oakland 4. Santa Cruz 1.
The mark'-t price ot lobsters !e again at a
gala at a
mi r.i mure. Swing's Dudes, tail-^r.ders and
tbe butt of baseball Jests, punished the
Crabs yesterday afterrioon Jn a way that
...
the good citizens of Santa Cruz will r.ot
â  -.
like. With Lange, one of Oakland's fifth
wheels, in. the box. the Crabs were able
to score but a single run. Tbey found
-
}.irn r.me times, but the hits were not
fruitful. The Dudes are a luckier lot of
1
ball tossers. With the same number of
biU tbey succeeded in gathering a col
lection of four runs, to the great sorrow
of the beach sleepers and the unconfinÂ«d â¢â 
Joy of EwJng, who will boy anybody a
. â  . i < â -â â â â  .'.r a
new hat that has the courago to ask
for it.
'
The game was very much of a hold- j
over from the r.igbt before. Processions, j
welcoming celebrations and pyrotechnics
-
acted as an exhaust upon the spirit and
â finr'-r of the eighteen baseball men who
cavorted on the Recreation Park dia
mond yesterday afternoon. Although j
there were few errors and enough stick
work to livf-n things up at rare intervals,
thÂ» game was listless and the crowd
rnrÂ»re so.
Daubenbia started the game for tbe
Crabs, who have lateiy beeo used in so
many varieties of shell-fish dishes that
s'irr.e Kr*-at restaurateur will make a
fortune by originating a new one. Haynes.
a. stalwart, heavily shouldered and big
nruscled diamond scraper, finished the
game whtn Daubenbis was retired.
-
Sehn'-'-r was ths first Dude to start the
fjccc-ssfu W'.rk for Oakland. Swatting an
hOnest tingle he made his second bag by
-
a Clean steal and coursed homeward or.
a two-bagger oy Moskiman, who after
ward scored on a hit which wasaccre^jte-d
to Hutchinson. This gave the I>ud*Â« a
- -
lead of two runs and would have b*-en
sufficient for the winning of the pam*- had
the eventful fifth been scratched off the
* *
â¢ -ri. wben they added another brace of
tillies to thÂ«-ir score. Dunleavy went jog
ging to first and Ur.p>; sent him to tr.e
second bag on a hit. A sacrifice by
Bchm<-*-r advanced both the base r_r.r,Â«*rs
a \**-v. when DÂ«-an. who was at the bat. |
â¢ - ight the spheroid right on the apple
and away it w^nt toward the i^p biue .
Th" ball landed in Drcnnan's hands.
but Dunleavy and Lange beat it in. and
thÂ» score was 4 to 1, in favor cf the j
Dudes.
The sole tally of the Crabs happened
'* -
this wise. Clark made the first bag on a
hit and scored on a beautiful double by
DrecnaA. Several tiroes ourinz the game ;
â - Lobsters ,were witbin an ace of scor- â 
but* it was not to be.
- -.: â  v* ry pretty f. elding work waa
Â»
cone by Drennan in d<-<**p renter and Dun
leavy at second. Tbe latter stopped % ,
bet grounder from Clark's bat in the '
eigbt innings, fel!. rolled over, but threw
HV:e a shot to second, shutting: out Streib.

Three Stakes Present Varied Sport
at Union Coursing: â Pre-
tender Suffers From a
Drugging.
t â 
Royal Flush, F. A. McComb's great black
Royal Flash, F. A. 24 - great black
greyhound, won his third successive stake
at Union Coursing Park yesterday. Men
; grown gray in the sport could not recall
where this had ever occurred before. Dogs
't have won more than three stakes, I at not
on successive coursing days. Flush was
I bred by McComb and comes by his speed
I naturally. He is by Skyrocket-Blackbird.
j His sire was a sensational performer, los
| ing but three stakes in a long career on
the field.
His hardest course yesterday was with
: Gladiator in the second round. Gladiator
j led nearly to the bare. Flush passing him
! and securing the first turn, the hare favor-
ing him a shade. Gladiator worked the
: hare for two turns, when Flush killed.
The spectators cheered the winning dog
I for his brilliant showing. He won the re-
maining courses cleverly, the final being
a splendid exhibition of speed, staying
â  qualities and working ability.
Lady Marion was drawn from the final
of the 'Consolation stake. In the previous ;
round she ran for over three minutes with
Magnesia.
In the Sapling stake Bona Fide, the ;
great Emm Pasha-Bona youngster, was
sick and did not run up to form.
' The mystery of the drugging of Van
Cloie on Saturday was not cleared up yes
terday, butl if anything was made deeper.
Pretender, a dog from the same kennel,
also developed unmistakable symptoms of
belladonna poisoning. He ran a bye in
the iirst round of the Consolation stake
and acted as though insane. The actions
of the dog were so peculiar that bets were
declared off in the succeeding round. This
proved a wise forethought. The dog re
fused to leave the slips, an almost unheard
of action among greyhounds. His eve?
were distended and other symptoms mdi- !
cated the presence of belladonna.
The park directors have commenced an
investigation in an attempt to fix the re- I
sponsibillty for the drugging. The owner i
and the trainer are above suspicion and '-
the investigators are looking elsewhere
for the culprit. The prompt and vigorous
action of the directors in the Koolawn
case is a guarantee that severe punish
ment will be meted out to the guilty per
son If he is apprehended.
James Grace handled the slips yester
day and gave general satisfaction in send
ing off the dogs. The detailed result* fol

Oakland OfT.ce .= - - Francisco Cali,
KÂ« Broadway, Aug. 27.
It is vary apparent that the City Coun-
cilmen would like to govern Oakland in
fact as well as ir. name. At present they
do not. In the most important particular
they have nothing to say, -.r.i that is In
the matter of fixing- a tax levy. It is true
they ga through the Routine performance
of declaring what the levy shall be and
how it shall be apportioned, but the
amount of taxation is determined for
them by the County Assessor. In other
words the County Assessor fixes the In-
-s tht In-
come for the city of Oakland ar.d this is
decidedly wrong. But pricr to this week
nobody seems to have made any com-
plaint.
But when the new charter is compiled.
:
as it will be ln a few months, there Is r.o
doubt that the section placed In the
present charter for the sake of economy
* * *
will t-e eliminated and one substituted
that will make it the duty of the City As-
- ;. a ; -
sessor to assess independently and not
merely to follow the f.gures of the County
!
Assessor.
The economical idea that has hitherto
prevailed is exploded, for nearly as much
is pa:i the County Assessor for a mere
copy of his dty assessment as wouid. if
â  - - *
added to the present salary of the City
Auditor, give the city an independent as-
sessment department. Should this be ar-
-
ranged ir. the new charter, there is not
much fear that it wili be combate<U>y the
County Assessor, for Mr. Dait(m has
â Â»r
always made a point of calling attention
to the: eeojromicai conduct of his office.
Although should this perquisite be taken
away from him, it will mean a loss of
*
about $7500 during a term less the actual
cost, Mr. Dalton Is not likely to fight it
-
on that account.
The movement to have a new charter
is having one effect: those interested in
-
the government of Oakland, as well as
those charged with conducting It. are
now looking into the oid charter to see
what it contains. One member cf the
Council said recently that he had been
-
four months in off.cc and he had not yet
completed the reading of the city charter,
which consists altogether of but eighty-
four moderate pages. They have dis-
co* ered many sections which are a sur-
prise to them. In view of ail the politi
cal pulling and manipulating in regard to
'â¢ . - -
patronage that disgraces every c:ty
govcmment it is surprising to read that
"no appointments or removals shall be
- -
made for political reasons, nor, shall any
removal be made except for cause es
tablished to the satisfaction of the
- * -
board." This was evidently brought to tee
attention of the old charter makers, for
at the very end of the charter tt was
somewhat qualified by this remarkable
section: "Competent and experienced em-
*
ployes in the several departments shall
not be unnecessarily removed." The
word "unnecessarily" must therefore be
responsible for ail the political rquabbles
-
regarding patronage that have been or
are now detrimental to good ar.d eco-
-
nomical government, ihe word "neces
sity" for removing a man admits of as
many constructions as there are political
faiths in the city governmentâ hence the
need cf a mere definite charter.
The greatest mistake ever made in gov
erning Oakland was the substitution of a
paid Board of Public Works and Police
Commissicr.ers for the honoary board that
the charter created. Under the old regime
before the amendment was passed, the
-
Board of Works consisted of three of the
most prominnent men in the city, who
were appointed one every two years by
-
the Mayor, each holding ofiice for six
years. The amendment made the City At
torney and the City Engineer elective of-
-
ficers, and they with the Mayor constitute
the Board of Works and the Police and
Fire Commission. Since this arrangement
went into practice the City Hail has been
a hotbed of politics and its government
has been characterized by Interminable
quarreling.
Prior to this monkeying with the char-
-
ter the City Engineer and City Attorney
were appointed by the Board of Works
and instead of dabbllnz in politics as they
are forced to do at present, they attended
to their business and were not forever
*
laying the foundation for perpetuating
themselves In office.
Ir. the c;d days the board met once a
week for the purpose of transacting busi
nes*. Since tnen boards have met nearly
every day of the week and have done al
most everything but attend solely to busi
ness. With the men who constituted the
eld board?, the appointment of a special
police officer or tne fact tbat one cf the
members differed from one of its employes
was not considered sufficient cause for
calling a special meeting and wastins
three or four hours doing politics and dis
crediting each other's motives. In those
days the City Engineer* attended to his
-
business because he had to. or some one
else would take his place. The same Is
true of the City Attorney. The chief pur
'
poses for which the Board of Works and
Police ar.d Fire Commision meet at this
.
time are tco well known to need any re
capitulation. It is sufficient to say "that
â  - *
a::y oid thing or reason Imaginary or real,
is surtic.'ent to Justify a cali for a special
meeting and to be the foundation of a lit
tle political squabble.
The manner in which the present char-
*
ter works is best illustrated by the fol
lowing incident: A property owner men
tionea to the Councilman from his ward
that a culvert should be constructed at a
*
tc-rtain street crossing. The Councilman
introduced into the Council a resolution of
intention to have the culvert built. Tho
matter was referred to the Street Com-
*
mittee. After a time it came back to the
Council with a recommendation tnat the
*
resolution he passed. The Board of
Works, of which the City Engineer is one.
was then authorized to perform tne work,
not to cost beyond a stipulated sum.
Sometime later :he Board of Works re
ceived the resolution and decided to dis
cuss /t in committee of the whole. When
I
the ' board heid the committee meeting
It decided that it would be a very good
thing to have a culvert at this point, and
they agreed to recommend to the Board
.
cf Works that such a culvert be con
structed. At the next meeting of the
Beard of Works the resolution waa re
formed tothe City Engineer, who is a mem
ber of the Board of Works, with instruc
t'ons to confer with the Streei Superin
tendent regarding the best manner of
bu'lding the cul\"ert and of the actual cost
cf the same. Some time later the En-
the Kn
s'-cer was ready to report to the board,
of"which he Is a third, regarding the cul-
- ? the cu;
vert^ and his report A as adopted and then
tnÂ« street Superintendent was ordered to
construct the culvert according to the
specifications laid down by the Board of
\<'orks. As soon as possible the Street
Superintendent proceeded to carry -it his
orders and found to his great surprise
t*at since the resolution of Intention was
first presented to the Council, a franchise
had been granted a street railroad to go
ovor thÂ» crossing where the culvert was
desired, and that therefore all the work
had to be gone over again, as the culvert
had to be constructed to go under the
tracks, and aiso the street railroad had to
be partly responsible for the payment of
its construction. . m_]P

It Is very unfortunate at this time that

j his ideas before the Board of Education
j and worked up that very conservative
1 body to such a high pitch of excitement
that language was used never before

j lier saw thing goc-d in the method of
' conducting the Oakland school system. He
credited the superintendent with -..:.? a

; drawn: that children were having their
I little minds distorted and distressed by
j being taught a lot of unnecessary stuff.
[ and finally concluded that somewhere in
i the neighborhood of one-half of the money
t allottee to the School Department
! was wasted. It was never ueflnltely set
i tied just how much truth there was in
i Mr. Cuvellier's arraignment, but there
jSs no doubt that he said altogether too
' much for a politician anxious to preserve
his standinc with certain elements. The
charges against the Board of Education
were never inquired Into and Mr. Cuveliler
must have been persuaded that they were
either untrue or impolitic or both, for the
.- j .
excitement cooled off as speedily as it
was created and since that â.-. Mr.

Mott's plan is simpie nd if anything sim

certainly should be considered. On the
other hand, lf Washington street be
opened quite straight it wiil necessitate
condemnation proceedings and will entail

would be entirely avoided by Mr. Mort' Â«
pian. The idea of having straight streets
:s a good one as a E*enefal principle. In
this stance it would work no benefit and
if insisted upon means that Washington
street will not be opened for years and
perhaps never. In the center of the city
a triangular block such as Mr. Mott's
scheme provides, would be no more ob
â¢ jectionable than a five-sided block with a
oorner cut off another one. sucn as would i

OAKLAND. Aug. Zl.â Some sensation
was created at the First Unitarian
Church," comer of Fourteenth and Grove
streets, yesterday morning by the pastor.
Rev. J. T. Sunderland, tendering nis
resignation. He assigned as his reason
the fact that the congregation was too
deepiv in debt. Some time ago a handsome
new edifice was erected and an indebted-
â 
re=s of $*2-j.-Â»} was thereby incurred, the
responsibilty of which the minister was
unwilling to bear.
Rev. Mr. Sunderland has been at the

Oakland is stiil coming home, and it has
now been proved beyond the perad%enture
of a doubt that the Athens of the Pa
cf a Athens oi . Pa
cific can be moved by a common im
pulse. The proof is the attendance of Oak
landers at the grand pageant and demon
stration tendered by San Francisco to the
returning First California Regiment.
The exodus for the metropolis began
when The Call announced by bulletins and
*
booming cannon the happy sighting of the
transport Sherman. Ever since then Oak
land has been moving across the bay,
ar.d now her people are coming home.
Fcr the last few evenings, and last
For rt few - - last
night in particular, the streets were de
serted as they never were before. Thou
sands of homes were temporarily bereft
of their occupants, yet last night the city
felt so safe that It spared a dozen or
more of its "Haesi." besides the Mayor
and nearly all the officials, for the great
parade. It would be foolish to speculate
as to when they came back. Numerous
disappearances were reported to-day, but
Chief of Police Hodzkins Is paying little
or no atention to these. He feels confi
dent that they will turn up when they
have had their surcease of the dazzling
splendor cf San Francisco hospitality.
Crossing the bay, however, carrfed with
. * Â«
it some unpleasantness bordering on the
humorous. The Southern Pacific, in its
effort to carry into effect Its declaration
-
that none of its ferry boats should carry
more than a reasonable and safe num
ber, had Its gatemen on the San Fran
cisco side shut their gates after punching
a certain quota of tickets for a good load.
and in this way many merry parties were
- i way i
split ut> ar.d many husbands and wives
were tStts temporarily and most involun
tarily separated rather unceremoniously.
The "ferry steamers and the trains on this
<de th" bay were running until nearly *>
o'clock this' morning, when the new day's
'-un began. Every trainâ and each con
tained more cars than ordinarilyâ was
crowded. It was certainly something tha;
bas rever befere been witnessed in the
history of Alameda and San Francisco

RAILROAD FRANCHISES
TO BE DISCUSSED
BERKELEY, Aug. 27.â 1t Is now a
month since the Southern PaclSc
Company made its first moxe toward
securing a monopoly of the street-car
traffic of the university town. To-morrow
night 't is expected that the *_oard of
Trustees, in their regular meeting, will
come to some decision in the matter.
The thing will not go through without
a vigorous protest. Property-owners on
Bancroft way are raising serious objec
tions to the use of that street for rail
way purposes, and the residents Of North
Berkeley are not likely to see their right
of free transportation into the central
part of town cut off without a struggle.
They will urge the board to take a longer
time to consider the matter, and thus
postpone for a month or more the final
granting of the monopoly to Uncle Collis.
Bids for the franchises close to-morrow
at noon. They are to be opened at 8 p. m..
when the Trustees are called to order. It
i â¢ understood .at the board will refuse
to accept a stated sum each year in con
sideration for the franchises, exacting in
stead, 3 per cent of the yearly receipts.

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Aug. Ti.
The police authorities are puzzled over
a burglary reported by Mrs. G. E. Bailey
as having been committed to-day at her
home. 2051 Linden street, and although but
little booty was secured the boldness and
daring outdoes In details the case reported
from the Blake block about two weeks
ago, wherein little. Ethel Roberts was
gagged by a burglar in her mother's room
In broad daylight.
The burglary at the Bailey residence
was committed this forenoon while Mr?.
Bailey, two at her daughters and a son
were atending church. Gladis. another
laughter aged I] years, had been left at
home to complete her toilet, which had
been delayed, and what occurred while
the girl was attending to these duties .8
tit by herself substantially as follows:
While standing before the mirror in her
mother's bedroom two apparently young
men, their faces partially hidden by black
masks, one with a brown mustache.
dressed In a gray coat and dark trousers
and Fedora hat, the other with a smooth
face, and in a dark suit wearing a gray
cap, entered the room, and -with revolvers
level- [ at her head threatened her with
instant death if she cried out. While one
of the intruders guarded her the other se
cured some clothesline rope and the girl
was then tied down in a chair, after which
a search was made for valuables. A purse
lying on the bureau, containing 11 15. was
about the only thing found worth taking.
The two burglars then untied the girl.
but before doing so secured some blacking
and blacked Gladis' face. Then they
locked her up In a closet off the kitchen.
They then made their exit through the
rear door. locking lt and placing the key
on the back porch.
When Mrs. Bailey and the other mem
bers of the family ....
the girl locked in the closet, and to them,
as well as to Detective Holland and Cap
tain Wilson of the police department,
Gladis related her story.
The girl declares she never saw the men
before. She says when they left one cf
them remarked, "You'll know me again
when ycu see me." the girl says she
dared not make an outcry for fear of be
ing murdered, so she calmly awaited the
return of her folks. The neighbor! is
a quiet one, not thickly settled and com
posed of churchgoing folk.
The police are Inclined to discredit the
girl's story, yet a thorough investigation
is to be conducted.

exhausted every one, and the city was
every r.o. and the dty was
inclined to stay at home and rest- The
decorations had, In a great measure, been
taken down, the palms had been torn
from their fastenings and the only things
left to remind one that a celebration had
taken place were the list of casualties
on the book of the 'P.-.- Hospital and
the bad painting on the front of the
Ferry buiidinsr.
Fortunately the Harbor Hospital had
little that was serious to report. There
was â -. lon* list of accidents chronicled,
but they amounted, with two exceptions.
to little more than bruised fingers r.i
fainting fits, though there were all sev
eral cases of those who bad drank not
wisely but too well.
The first of the two exceptions was
George Battorf, a young mar. employed in
the Sacramento Rolling Mills. He had
come down to the city to help along the
festivities. In order to properly fall In
with the spirit of the occasion he filled
up on the spirit? of East street. But his
plans miscarried. Instead .of falling in
with the occasion he fell into the bay
from the end of Mission wharf and was
fished out and taken to the hospital just
In time to save his life. He was dis
charged this morning and left for the in
terior, where, he says, he will re content
to remain In the future.
The second exception was Mrs. Nellie
Jacobson of j"4 Howard street, who took
exception to the amorous advances of a
casus stranger. Her rejection of the
compliment so offered the stranger that
he drew a knife and slashed her face.
The stranger is onw being eagerly sought
for along the water front
The only arrival of any importance
during the day was the Pacific Coast
Steamship ------ Curacao,
which came in yesterday morning after a
ten days' trip up the coast from Guay
mas. She brought no news of interest,
and her voyage was uneventful.
The Chief Wharfinger's office received
an order yesterday to keep steam up on
the Markham, so that she would be
ready to leave on a moment's notice and
go out to meet the transport Grant as
soon as that vessel is reported. -ry

Fritz W -- - : Un '..--
Frita Wolfert and Mrs. Lena Muheim
went boat riding on the bay yesterday,
and during* the progress oi a dispute be
tween them the boat was capsized. Noth
ing baa been heard cr seen of Wolfert
since, and Mrs. Muheim was rescued some
hours later by Hans Nelson, who found
her clinging to the upturneu boat.
All the parties live out on the San
Bruno road, beyond Silver avenue. Wol
fert Is, or was, a clam digger by occupa
tion and a boaster by profession. It was
his profession that was the indirect cause
of the accident Although he had a wife
and a grown bob, he spent much of his
time la the company of Mrs. Muheim,
who also has a husband living.
Wolfert had frequently boasted to Mrs.
Muheim that he was an expert with the
oars and could swim like a fish. On many
occasions he- bad offered to take rout
rowing, but always failed, on some pre
text or other, to keep his promise. Yes
terday morning Mrs. Muheim chided him
and told him that she believed he was
afraid of the water. That was too much.
Be went straight and secured a flat
bottom boat and invited Mrs. Muheim to
accompany him. She accepted the invita
tion, and they started about '. o'clcck in
the afternoon.
Mrs. Muheim states that they had no
sooner pulled away from the shore thai
she was sails that Wollert had never
been in a boat before. He handled the
oars awkwardly and finally lost one of
them overboard.
Mrs. Muheim's statements as to what
followed are somewhat foggy She told
Hans Nelson, who rescued her. that she
and Wolfert engaged in a row and during
the scrimmage the boat was capsized. To
the reporters she said that Wolfert at
tempted to light his pipe, lost his balance
and as he went overboard grabbed her
dress and pulled her in after him. She
remembers struggling in the water for
some time and finally reaching the boat.
She looked around for her companion,. but
he had disappeared. She says that she re
mained in the water, .... bot
tom of the boat, for more than an hour
before she was rescued.
The Coroner was notified, but no at
....... made to recover the body.

Close of the Triduum.
The triduum, or three days' devotion,
came to a close last nipht. This festival,
which is meant as a consecration of all
Catholics to our Lord, is held at different
times of the year in different parts of the
world. It is a final dedication of thanks-
Bivlnjf for blesslngs^and favors of the
past, and is intended to be a fitting spirit
ual close for the century. It has nothing
to do with the coming year. That is to
be signalized by the promulgation of a
jubilee. The trlduum has been observed
In the conventional establishments during
the past week, and In the churches during
the last three days, ending last night at
vespers with the act of solemn consecra
tion.

RECUPERATING FROM
THE CELEBRATION
A Quiet Day in Camp and a
Boisterous Crowd in the
City Streets. j
YESTERDAY was a quiet day at the
camp of the Californians, despite
the fact that the battalion streets
were full of people and every tent was
full of friends. So much excitement as
lias been given the volunteers finally be
comes hard work, and yesterday the boys
v.*. re tired.
Ten o'clock on Sunday was the warn
ing each man received as he left the
camp Saturday evening, and they did try
to return on time, but to err is human,
and the error in this case was still ap-Â«
parent at 12. , .
As was expected, it was visitors nay.
There were more people in camp than
the Presidio has seen in a long time, and
among them all there were few who did
not know at least one of the volunteers.
The boys held levy on tho steps of their
tents, upon their boxes and baggage in
side, along the sidewalks and in the
camp streets. ' A constant stream of peo-
*â "".".
ple passed up and down before the staff
otlicers' tents of both infantry and artil
lery, and a crowd was way- around the
piles of baggage still remaining to be
opened and Inspected. The baggage has
practically all been passed, but there is
a great deal still awaiting some one to
take possession. . .
Souvenirs were what many of the peo
ple wanted, and souvenirs were what
many who sought received. The soldiers
were good-humored, and anything went
from a brass button to a Spanish rifle.
Luckily, however, most of what souvenirs
the men brought home had already gone
to those for whom they were Intended.
otherwise under the genial influence of
the welcome the men might have become
too charitable.
The work of mustering out and the lib
erty of the men are the principal sources
of conversation. The work will com

mence to-day at 10 o'clock, and when the
in. were let go last evening they were
warned to return at that hour and no
later. The officers of the regiment and
the battalion will be taken in hand by the
mustering officers, and will be shown ex
actly what will be expected of them. As
for the liberty of the men, lt will rest ln
a great measure upon themselves. If they
return promptly upon th.*. expiration of
thoir leaves or, lacking passes, if they re
port promptly at reveille and retreat,
their liberty need not bother them much,
for they will get plenty. Hut if there is
any disposition to impose upon the mili
tary routine of **.c camp, under the pre
text of insistent friends or relatives,
there will be trouble at once, and the
men will have to stay in camp. Unless
the men attend to business the three
weeks quired for mustering out the
commands will run into a month or more,
and too much leisure -will prove a harm
instead of a benefit. *
An Invitation from the people of
Oakland, asking all volunteers who
are residents of Oakland, Alameda
and Berkeley to be over on the
7 o'clock broad pauge ferry to-morrow
evening, has been received and posted
upon the order boards. Colonel Duboce
says, .however, that he cannot be respon
sible for the picking out of the men. He
has given the invitation the fullest pub
licity, but unless the men come to him or
their friends send in the names he can
not undertake to find them. The work of
the officers is behind already, and it must
be delayed no longer, but If those of his
men who are entitled to the courtesy ex
tended will make the request he will
grant them furloughs for the occasion.
The welcome of the volunteers has not
been confined to the city, as telegrams
from all over the country will testify.
Colonel Duboce received three of which
lie is particularly proud. The first is
from Brigadier General Charles King,
who sent this from Milwaukee:
Commanding Officer First California Volun
teers: Welcome home to every man and to
honors richly deserved. CHARLES KING.
Colonel John R. Berry sent the follow
ing:
On behalf Seventh California I welcome you
and regiment to home, sweet home, and con
gratulate you upon regiment's honorable record
ln service* and luster it sheds upon California
and Its military organization. Absence from
means of communication prevented earlier ex
pression. JOHN R. BERRY.
Brigadier General C. F. A. Last of the
First Brigade sent this:
Welcome home. My con-pratulatlons to you
Welcome home. My congratulations to you
ill on the brilliant record you have made.
C. F. A. LAST, Brigadier General.
These telegrams have been put among
the regiment's records.
THE CITY RECUPERATING.
It Took a Day for the People
to Recover From the
Celebration.
San Francisco occupied its time yester
day recuperating. The usual Sunday
crowds were nowhere to be seen. The
streets looked lonesome and deserted.
The only evidence remaining of Cali
fornia's welcome to her soldier sons was
stray pieces of tattered bunting, ungainly
frames that were the night before gayly
decorated reviewing stands, ! and the
pieces of palm leaves that had done
service transforming Market street Into
a beautiful vista, but which yesterday
littered the roadway and the sidewalks
from the ferry depot to the City Hall.
The people did not go to bed until long
after daylight Sunday morning, and then
only because the dawn robbed their an
tics of much of the novelty and delight
that the darkness gave. When old Sol
peeped over the eastern hills, San Fran
cisco, her people and her guests pre
sented a sorry sight. They had indulged
in a night of the wildest revelry and
were experiencing the difference that Is
said to come -with the dawn of day.
Thousands whose homes were on the
other side of the bay, having failed to I
make connection with the last boat over,
sought rest and slumber on the streets,
in doorways, ln the vestibules of some of
the big Market-street buildings in fact any
place that afforded the slightest shelter
or surface upon which to repose their
weary bones. This condition was by no
means confined to the men. "Women,
babes in arms and little tots barely big
enough to toddle spent the night out
in the fog and dampness because they
had no alternative. Thete was not a room
nor a bed to be had in the city. Hotel
keepers, who have always claimed that
no San Francisco attraction could draw j
people in sufficient numbers to tax their !
accommodations to the limit, were as
tounded at the multitudes of strangers
that came to Join in the soldier boys'
welcome. In numbers the throng beat
anything in the city's history. The
hotels were crowded, and days before the
transport was sighted they were turning
away applicants by the hundred. That
is why people were forced to seek sleep
in the streets the night of the big
parade.
Few of them got much slumber. The
turmoil of the wild, unmanageable mob
that took possession of Market street
and its tributaries after the parade had i
passed made sleep impossible. One who
was not acquainted with the excuse for
all the latitude might reasonably have |
reached the conclusion that this was a
city of demons or inhabited by the sub
jects of an insane asylum. The night
mob was not composed of the same peo
ple who so good naturedly submitted to
the elbowing and crushing, the rough
handling and clubbing by the police while
they scrambled for places of vantage
from which to view the parade. It was a
different set altogether. The early even
ing crowd admired the evergreen decora
tions, took Its hat off to the display of
national colors and was imbued with a

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, AUGUST 28. 1899.
EAGER FOR THE CALL'S STORY OF
THE BOYS OF CALIFORNIA'S FIRST
Crowds Purchasing the Great Souvenir Edition of Last Thursday.
THAT the souvenir edition of The Call Issued last Thursday morning in honor of the return of the First Califor
nia Regiment, is thoroughly appreciated by the public is evidenced by the enormous sales of the paper. There
never was such a big demand for a special issue of a San Francisco paper. The first edition, which was
thought to V" large enough to meet all demands, was exhausted after the paper had been on sale two days. An
other large edition was run off yesterday and is melting away like snow in the rays of a summer sun. The news
boys in front of The Call office have been rushed from early morn until midnight attending to customers. Most of
the papers are being purchased to send away to friends. The mailing is done free by The Call and yesterday mail
sacks filled with the papers that had been sold during the day were piled high around the newsboys' tables. Many
people, appreciating the superiority of The Call's volunteers news, are purchasing in one wrapper Thursday, Fri
day, Saturday and Sunday papers and sendinr: them away. The souvenir edition is being disposed of so rapidly
that those who have not yet made their purchases had better send in their orders now and avoid disappointment.
THE DAY AFTER THE PARADE.
spirit of true patriotism -which ln turn
created legitimate enthusiasm.
The mob that followedâ that yelling,
screeching crowd that turned night into
a veritable bedlamâ on mischief bent.
It took advantage of the latitude allowed
by the police by res- jn of the event to
commit acts of vand ism that would not
have been tolerated on any other occa
sion. It stripped Market street of its
gala garb in a twinkle, and strewed the
thoroughfare with debris. It passed
down the line like a cyclone, leaving de
struction and dirt in its wake. Every
thing perishable the citizens had used to
emphasize the warmth of their welcome
was swept away before this mob of
furies, s. ~s Â.
A policeman at the corner of Stockton
A policeman at. the corner of Stockton
and Market streets, who had the hardi
hood to call a halt, was assaulted and
barely escaped with his life. Then who is
surprised that San Francisco breathed a
sigh of relief when the streaks of gray
in the eastern skies heralded the ap
proach of day? With that the crowds
separated and went to bed, and many of
them may be sleeping yet. '
The soldier boys have been welcomed
home as soldiers were never welcomed
before. The city and the State are satis
fied with the entertainment they pro
vided. Their enthusiasm has been given
vent; they are exhausted, and . now all
they hope for is that things may resume
their normal condition without delay.
The people are glad that the boys in
blue are home again, and they are glad
that they have made provision to care
for them and to provide for their future.
The welcome passes into history.
During the early morning excitement
yesterday a crowd got possession â¢of a
noisy gong that sounded like the bell on
a fire patrol. Starting from the corner
of Market and Third streets they made a
dash toward Montgomery, clanging the
gong and yelling "fire." Loiterers on the
sidewalks Joined in the cry and fol
lowed the crowd. The dreaded . alarm
awoke the guests of the hotels and
for a time a panic was threatened.
When that line of amusement lost Its
novelty the crowd returned to the start
ing point and undertook to clear the
sidewalks of the boxes and other obstruc-'
tions that had been used as seats from
which to view the parade. The boxes
were being hurled into the street when
some onlooker was struck. In a jiffy he
picked up a missile and cast it at the
crowd on the sidewalk. The fire was re
turned and in an instant the air was
filled with pieces of broken boxes and
cobble stones. Serious damage would
have been done had not a squad of police
been near by and dispersed the mob. Sev
eral of the men were hit by the flying
fragments, but while blood flowed freely
no one was apparently seriously hurt.
The fad of the frolickers was to slap
the face of every passer-by with a
piece of palmleaf torn from the street
decorations. The crowd was no re
specter of sex. for the women who ven
tured out at that time of the night were
treated to the same torment as the men
This trick precipitated several incipient
riots and a number of sanguinary con
flicts.
There waa a "hot time ln the old town."
The musical announcement of every band

time was hotter than the citizens antici
pated or wish to experience again. The

Hotelkeeper Says He Declared His
Intention of Killing Brown and
the Barnes Woman Because
the Barnes Woman Because
They Were No Good.
â â¦
" George Tanner, the saloonkeeper who
shot to death Deputy Sheriff James B.
Brown and Mrs. Fannie Barnes in the
St. Malo Hotel Saturday evening,. shows
little signs of remorse for his deed as he
languishes ln the City Prison. He talks
little about the affair, but still contends
that he killed a couple of bad people.
Louis Miller, proprietor of the hotel in
which the tragedy occurred, threw addi
tional light upon the affair yesterday, j
Miller claims that at about 3 o'clock on
Saturday afternoon Tanner visited him
and demanded his pistol which had been
in the hotel proprietor's keeping for
the past two months. When asked what
he desired the weapon for, Tanner re
plied that he was going to kill Brown and
his consort, as they were no good.
Upon Brown's arrival home two hours
later. Miller informed him of Tanner's
threat and admonished him to be
cautious. A few minutes afterward
Tanner himself appeared and went up to
Brown's room. The latter pushed Tanner
away from him and a scuffle ensued which
lasted several minutes, xirown finally
tossed Miller a bunch of keys, one of
which would open a police alarm box,
and asked him to call the patrol wagon.
Miller started out on his errand, but had
not gone very far when he heard the
shots, and returning found Tanner stand
ing over the two lifeless bodies, appar
ently gloating over his work.
"What did you do this for?" exclaimed
Miller. "You are a bad man."
"I didn't do any harm," was Tanner's
reply, "for they deserved it."
Police Officer Robert "Whittle has been
detailed by the authorities on the case.
He spent yesterday in gathering evidence
and in making a minute examination of
the premises on which the tragedy oc
curred. There is one bullet hole in the
wall of the hall, about three feet from the
floor. According to the officer, the loca
tion of the hole would indicate that Tan
ner was standing near the door when he
fired the shots.
The shooting was a surprise to detec
tives, who knew Brown as being a man
handy with his gun. He had been impli
cated in more than one shooting affray,
and one in particular was recalled. About
nine years ago Brown pretended to be
jealous of the attentions of John Coulter,
a policeman, to his wife. They met in a
saloon on Brannan street and Brown
opened fire on Coulter, who returned it.
The shots went wild and no one was in
jured. Brown compelled his wife to pre
fer charges against Coulter, and he was
dismissed from the force.
Brown deserted his wife shortly after.
He had treated her cruelly and she could
stand it.no longer. She got a divorce
from him and the custody' of their daugh
ter. She was an Englishwoman of good
education, but his. treatment of her drove
her to drink, and after her divorce she
became reckless of her reputation and
went down hill very fast.
Brown had been consorting with Mrs.
Barnes for some years. About four years
ago he got angry at Tanner's attentions to
her,' and procured a warrant in the late
Judge Campbell's court for Tanner's ar
rest-on the charge of grand larceny for
stealing her sealskin sack. The warrant
was only a bluff and it never was served.
HAYES STILL MISSING.
News was received . yesterday from
Sheriff Farley of Salinas that the where
abouts of Joseph Hayes.- the San Fran-
Msco saloon-keeper who disappeared
from Paraiso Springs some time ago, ls
still unknown. His first report received
yesterday by Mrs. Hayes in this city was
to the effect that a flock of buzzards
was seen to be hovering over a spot in
the canyon which is covered by a heavy
undergrowth. Investigation, however,
proved that the carcass of a horse was
the attraction for the buzzards, and that
Hayes' body was not in the vicinity.
The Sheriff requested Mrs. Hayes to offer
a reward, which she has done.
Snatched His Watch
Frank Soto, a miner, was. arrested last
evening by Police Officer Eastman and
charged with an atempt to commit grand
larceny. It is claimed that he snatched a
watch and chain from M. Anderson, a la
borer, while they .were engaged in a heat
ed dispute on Fourth street, near Mission

ENDED HIS AGONY.
Horse "With. Eyes Burned From the !
Sockets Ordered Shot.
"With his eyes burned from the sockets
and the roasted flesh hanging ln strips
from Its back, a valuable horse belonging
to Jacob Boss of 2274 Bush street escaped
from the fire on California street Satur
day night and made his way a distance of
seven or eight blocks to the Lennon sta
bles, 2609 Bush street, where he had been
formerly kept. The incident is remark
able from the fact that the animal was
sightless and terror stricken. The neigh
ing of the horse attracted the attention of
the liveryman, who took him into the
stable and made him as comfortable as
possible. The unfortunate beast was suf
fering frightful agony and its groans
could be heard for blocks. A veterinary
was summoned and afforded the horse
temporary relief. Yesterday the animal's
condition was such that the Society for
the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals |
ordered him shot.
The fire did more damage than was at
first supposed. Among those whose prop- |
erty suffered by water and smoke was I
Dr. Charles V. Cross, California and Fill
more streets, whose loss amounts to $1500
to his residence by the Fire Department
while playing its hose on the burning
stables. M. Goldsmith, a letter-carrier.
who resided next door to the stable, had
his home totally destroyed.
Fourteen valuable horses were roasted
to death and in addition several sets of
harness and some very valuable vehicles '
were destroyed. !
