TOXDON, Oct. 21.â The stirring devel- I
opments of the week form a vivid j
J 4 contrast to that wearisome period of
procrasti nation and suspense which
preceded the outbreak of the war, though
I'arliamer.t has quickly and dramatically
tanctioned the momentous action of the
Cabinet. The first battle worthy of the
name has been fought, and an army
corps", England's military effort in this
century, is now on the way, bent upon
sioministering an eternal quietus to South
African unrest.
The thrilling scene In the House of
Commons of a member of the Cabinet
making an impassioned defense of his own
honesty against the imputation of delib
erately involving England in war; the
far-reaching significance of the intima
tion by the cautious Prime Minister that j
England's rule throughout the whole of [
South Africa must be absolute, and many
other striking points in an epoch-making 1
week have been almost entirely obscured
by the overwhelming interest of the
ehnrp, meager bulletins bearing date at â :
Ladysmlth that tell of victory and of how â¢
many died to gain it. Historians may dis- j
miss as insignificant .the military opera- |
tions which have co far marked the prog
ress of the war; but for the people of j
England these and those of the immediate
future have transcontinental importance,
Glfncoe and Ladysmith irresistibly
rivet national attention; and â when the
nverage Britisher lauds the pluck that !
won Friday's battle and still keeps the ;
flag flying over Mafeking, he reverts to
the universal query, "What will White do |
r.ext?"
Sir Redvers Buller. last week's idol, has j
almost passed out of the popular mind. i
although that general, despite the fact
that he is in midocean and unaware of i
what befell the Boers at Glencoe, appears ;
to be the main factor In the situation. I
The Associated Press is reliably informed :
that his last act before leaving was to
cable Sir Stewart White forbidding any \
p,rit:.-h advance pending the arrival of
the army corps.
It is understood in army circles that
General White believed himself quite
Ftrong enough to advance through Laings i
Neck. Sir Redvers Buller's prohibition, if .
carried out, resolves all prognostication j
Into the simple statement that upon the !
extent of Boer aggressiveness depends I
the number and nature of the engage- '
ments that are to mark the next month's
fighting.
Probably the Boer movement was
curbed by the dofcat at Glencoe, but it .
peems reasonable to believe, judging from L
the determination and fanaticism of the j
Boer forces, that they will, sooner or j

the fioldâ return to the field with re
doubled aggressiveness in a desperate at
tempt to break the backbone of GÂ»-
White's forces, having previously en
deavored to weaken it by feint and flank
movements. Such a supposition regarding
plans is based upon the belief that
tandant General Joubert's main ob- ,
Jectlve Is to break up or rout General :
White's command before the British rein
ments arrive. But it is possible the
wily Boer general has carefully concealed
a strategy which he intends to carry out :
In an unexpected direction and that the
attack upon Genera! v ETrlday was
merely Intended to deceive the British as
to the main objective. Reliable news from
the Boers Is so hard to secure in London
that it is impossible to predict with any
certainty what the next few ,
weeks are likely to bring forth.
It is said that the plans of Sir RedvÂ«r<=
Buller, subject to finding on his arrival
that the complexion of the campaign is
not entirely changed, are to have four
divisions, each a little army In itself and
each capable of meeting the full strength
of the Boers. As his forces will exceed
men, this is regarded as feasible, j
With three armies he intends to invade '

Ing to criticize General Buller's admitted
military genius without knowledge of in- j
formation on which he has based his esti- ;
matlon of the Boers' strength, there is a j
growing feeling that the war will event- |
ually resolve itself into a guerrilla cam- :

this connection to the state of the Ameri- |
can forces In the Philippines.
ral Englishmen who have lived
; among the Boers, but are now In Eng
' land, assert that the Boers will nover
stick to their artillery, and there is a ;
: unanimous feeling among those who know
th<- Transvaal and its inhabitants that
the Boer artillery will cut only a small
figure after the first month. The explana
tion of this is two-fold. In the first place,
most (>t the Boers are unaccustomed to ;
fighting according to the methods re

{and, Beeondfy, most of them are armed

It is not believed that the Boors will
suffer so much by the loss of artillery as
might at first be thought Unencumbered
by puns they regain that mobility which,
in the previous war, proved such a thorn
in the side of the English organized
troops.
A splendid instance of the spontaneous
co-operation of the army and the navy is
given in the action of Captain Lambton,
commanding the British first-class pro
tected cruiser Powerful, while on the way
to the Cape. Calling at Mauritius, he
found a line regiment that has been or
dered to Durban unable to leave for want
â¢ransport. Without waiting instruc
tions he embarked the whole regiment on
board the Powerful and landed them at
Cape Town, making an extra quick
ige for th'-ir benefit.
PATHETIC SCENES
OUTSIDE WAR OFFICE
LONDON, Oct 21.â Outside the War
Office the scenes were pathetic enough
yesterday, when the news of the battle
of Glencoeâ lt is officially called the bat
tle of Dundeeâ got circulated, but to-day
they were infinitely more so. Anxiety
and feverish excitement were plainly de
picted on the faces of the crowd. All day
long, from an early hour in the morning,
the throngs eagerly waited. When bit
by bit the list was posted on the green
baize board, how eagerly the names were
scanned. When perhaps the list of casu
alties in one corps was complete, mingled
with the waitings and sobs of grief of
stricken mothers and young girls was
the lightsome laughter of others whose
boys were not among the slain or wound
ed. It was a heart-wringing scene.
When announcements were made of the
lities among the gallant King's
-. who suffered so terribly in their
grand - ip Dundee Hill, the inten
sity of pri^f displayed was pathetic.
Among the rich and poor, the proud
aristocrat and London's humblest citi
zens, there are many broken hearts to
night. And this is only the beginning.
ANXIETY FOR THE
EIGHTEENTH HUSSARS
LONDON, Oct. 21.-The War Office Is
still besieged to-night by anxious in
s, but the officials have no further
news from Glencoe. Some anxiety is oe
ginning to be felt for the Eighteenth
Hussars, whose return from their pursuit
the Boers has not yet been officially
notified to the War Office.
Lady Symons has heard that her hus
was slightly better.

meager, the wires being overloaded with
official dispatches.

Disquieting News of an Ocean Dis

the Transport Senator.
MINNEAPOLIS, Oft. 21.-The transport

Colonel Charles Denby and Professor
Dean Worcester, the remaining members
of the Philippine commission, who are re
turning post haste to Washington.
These men saw wreckage in the swell of
the typhoon that crossed the track of the
Senatur. They saw the glowering storm
and wire caught in the edge of It. Their
own boat, the Empress of Japan, a jhip
accounu.l fur staneher than the Senator,
suffered damage from the half-spent force
of its gale. The sailors said they believed
the Senator was in the midst of the ty
phoon.
The next day a lifeboat and a spar were
seen floating on the frothy sea over
which the typhoon had swept.

Thursday. A small body of Boers ap
proached Klmberley on Wednesday, and
Major Charaier made a sortie with a re
connoitering party and some guns on
board an armored train. After a few
shots had be.>n exchanged the burghers
fled precipitately. There were no casual
ties on the British side.
The police garrisons of fourteen streams
and towns have arrived at Kimberley.
Everything tends to confirm the statement
that Colonel B.ulen-Powell temporarily
worsted the Boers at Mafeking, and it ap
pears true that upward of 300 wounded
Boers have arrived at Johannesburg.
RETREAT OF BOERS
BECAME A ROUT
LONDON, Oct 21.â The early dis
patches regarding yesterday's battle near
Dundee conveyed the impression that the
whole affair was over in a couple of
hours, the British artillery silencing the
Boer guns and infantry and then simply
charging right over the hill. According
to the later advices, however, the battle
lasted eight hours, and nearly seven
hours elapsed before the last Boer gun
was put out of action. The Irish Fusi
liers and King's Rifles meanwhile had
advanced to the assault and were shoot
ing their way up the hill, driving the
Boers back from shelter to shelter until
the final rush of the British carried thorn
to the summit. A curious fact was that
several times a lull occurred in the firing
on both sides, the British Infantry ap
parently taking a breathing space in the
stiff climb, and the Boers also holding
back their fire.
The magnilic*"*it practice of the British
guns was an immense help, and the suc
cess of the assault was greatly due
thereto. Once the British bayonets
showed on the top of the kopje the Boers
retreated, and when on reaching the
other side they found a British battery
and cavalry outflanking them the re
treat became a rout. The British guns
followed, and, unllmbertng from time to
time, threw shells into the flying foe. A
heavy rain began falling during the after
noon, which naturally impeded artillery
operations. It was a coincidence that
yesterday was the anniversary of a sim
ilar feat of British arms in India, when
the Gordon Highlanders stormed the
heights. _
DEPARTING TROOPS
GIVEN A BIG SEND OFF
LONDON. Oct. 21.â London gave the
guards a grand farewell to-day on their
departure for Southampton, where they
embarked for the Cape. Three battalions
of the First Scots and Second Coldstreams
and Third Grenadiers left. Along the
whole route from the barracks to the
railway station the troops received an
ovation. Before many yards were cov

"but I am forced to admit that there is"
cause for some apprehension as to the
fate of the Senator. It would not be well
to say at this time that the transport is
lost, for that would perhaps cause need
less anguish to the friends and relatives
of those aboard it; but it is -well the
meager truth we know should be made
public."
The date of sailing from Yokohama was
set for October 6, but in the meantime
word was received from the Manila Ob
servatory that a typhoon was moving
northward and would pass near the Japa
nese coast. Many or the American colony
urged the captain not to sail the Senator
out of port that date, but he told them to
put away their fears and he slipped his
moorings and set out for home. The fol
lowing day the Empress of Japan sailed
out of Yokohama for Vancouver with
Colonel Denby and Professor Worcester
aboard. They left the Japanese port at
sunrise, and before sundown they were
being tossed by the rim of the typhoon.
The Empress of Japan shifted its course
and ran from tha typhoon. ;

There was a pleasing Incident to-day as
the Amr-rican steamer St. Louis passed
the British transport Gasgon, about to

liner cheered lustily, waving their hats
and handkerchiefs, and the soldiers re
led with three cheers for the Ameri
cans.

ENGLISH VERSION OF
FIRST DUNDEE BATTLE
LONDON. Get 21.â A correspondent in
Glencoe camp sends the following dis
pftt h under date of October 20, morning:
"Daybreak disclosed the Dutch all
around Dundee. As soon as they were In
position on the hill behind Vetersmlth's
house, where they posted a cannon, rifle
fire began generally and to wake up they
put several shots arid shells slap into the
camp, causing a speedy evacuation of the
tents and forming up of all the ranks
outside the camp. Our guns were soon in
action and replied with telling
The whizzing of the shots as they passed
over our heads had music in it; yet, be
yond a natural dodging of heads their
effect was not dl
"So effective was our artillery fire that
in ten minutes the guns of the Boers were
all silenced. I could see from my position
how telling it was. I could see members
of the staff going about their duties as
coolly as if the whole thing was a sham
battle. As soon as the Boer fire slack
ened our artillery, which had been beauti
fully served, trotted into town and posted
themselves. They soon compelled the ene
my to retire, but yet they appeared like
so many bees in groups at every place of
vantage which skirted the town, while
others were driven toward the coal fields.
"Our guns continued to play on Smiths
Hill, where beautiful practice was made.
Ac the shells burst the Dutchmen could
be seen scampering for cover. While our
guns were so engaged the Hussars de
ployed on the left flank. Soon the can
nonading ceased, and after five minutes'
sharp work all was over. This may be
put down as the first battle of Dundee.
"The battle was soon renewed with
great visor. At 7:30 a message arrived
telling the camp that 9000 Boers are
marching on us with the intention of at
tacking our rear. A heavy mist which
caps the surrounding hill obscures tlu-ir
approach and they may be upon us any
hour. The only casualties known on our
side are the wounding of a trumpeter and
a drummer in the Sixty-ninth Battery."
RHODES REFUSES
TO LEAVE KIMBERLEY
LONDON, Oct. 21.â A special dispatch
from Cape Town states that a message
has been received there from Kimberley
stating that Cecil Rhodes has been urged
to leave the town, but refuses to do it,
being determined to see the thing
through.
VIENNA, Oct. 21.â The victory of the
Uriiish at Glencoe came as a vast sur

army. The importance of the victory is
fully recognized as exercising a decisive
influence on the whole campaign.
PARIS, Oct. 21.â The news from Glen

LONDON, Oct. 21.â According to the

"GREED AND HUNGER
FOR LAND AND GOLD"
Unpleasant Comment of the Germans
on the War Waged hy England
in South Africa.
Copyrighted, 1599, by the Associated Press.
BERLIN, Oct. 21.â The German press is
Just as unanimously anti-British in the
Transvaal war as It was anti-American in
the war between the United States and
Spain. Even the liberal papers, although
politically and commercially they have all
along sought and found an ideal in Eng
land, now strongly disapprove of Eng
land's procedure in varied but never com
plimentary utterance. The speakers In
the British Parliament are charactprized
as "hypocritical," and the British people
and Government are described as "de
voured by land hunger," and "for greed
for Transvaal gold."
The Kreuz Zeitung says: "The peace
conference at The Hague accomplished at
least something; for. still more than the
verdict given by that international tri
bunal, the unanimous opinion of the whole
world is against the English proceeding
which is due to mammon worship alone.
Everywhere the verdict Is mat 'greed and
hunger for land and gold do not yet confer
the right to go to war.' "
The Frankfurter Zeitung says: "The
specious phrase, 'England is compelled to
begin war because the Boers will not
grant the same rights to the Outlsfaders
as to the burghers." is repeated over and
over again. It has. been used by the En
glish poet laureate, by Ministers in Parlia
ment and by the press, but that does not
make the phrase true."
To the complaint of the English press
that the entire press of Germany
with the Boers, the Deutsche Tage Zei
tung replies: "Quite so. We all wish and
hope that England may m>->et with de
feat; and this quite aside from our sym
pathies with the Boers. The whole oi
Germany thinks as we do."
The Lokal Anzeigex says: "The English
promptly prepare the second class cruis
ers Hlacin.fh, Highflyer. Juno and Charyb
d!s to join the special service squadron
about to be commissioned.
Loyal to the Queen.
LONDON, Oct. 21 âThe paramount
chief of the Basutos, according to a (Hs
patch from Cape Town, has asked per
mission to assemble the other Ba
chiefs with a view of inviting them to
pledge loyalty to the Queen. This is as
sumed tc be a forerunner of a Busuto
movement, and Orange Free State burgh
ers near the Basuto border are said to
be in a state of consternation.
A dispatch from Cape Town announces
that a British force with held guns landed
yesterday at Simonstown and took a
train for the north. The exact destination
has not been revealed.
Symons' Death Reported.
LONDON, Oct. 21.â A late edition of the
Pall Mall Gazette announces the death ol
General Symons, but this report has not
been contirmed.

BRITISH COST OF THE
CAPTURE OF DUNDEE HILL
LONDON, Oct. 21.â The "War Office announces that in the fighting yester
day between Glencoe and Dundee, in Natal, thirty-one non-commissioned
officers and men were killed and 151 wounded. The following is a lisr Âf
the casualties received from Sir George Stewart White, dated Ladyirmith,
October 21, 4:20 a. m. :
Divisional staffâ General Symons, mortally wounded; Colonel C. E. Beck
ett, assistant adjutant general, severely wounded; Major Frank Hammers
ley, department of assistant adjutant general, seriously wounded.
" Brigade staffâ Colonel John Scherston. department officer and brigade ma
jor, killed; Captain F. L. Adam, aid-de-camp, seriously wounded.
Leicestershire Regimentâ Lieutenant D. W. "Weldon. wounded slightly.
First Battalion Royal Dublin Fusil eersâ Lieutenant M. C. B. Barber and
Second Lieutenant A. H. M. Hill, killed: Major W. P. Davidson, wounded-
Captain F. H. B. Connor, wounded, since dead; Captan J. W. Pike, wounded'
Lieutenant C. C. Southey, wounded; Lieutenant H. C. W. Wortham, wounded'
Second Battalion Royal Dublin Fusileersâ Captain G. A. Welson, killed;
Captain M. Lowndtis, wounded; Captain A. Dibley, wounded; Lieutenant c!
N. Perring, wounded: Lieutenant C. G. J. Genge, wounded, since dead.
King's Royal Riflesâ Lieutenant Colonel R. H. Guning. killed; Captain H
K. Peehell. killed; Lieutenant J. Taylor, killed; Lieutenant R. C. Barnett.
killed; Lieutenant N. J. Hambro, Rilled: Major C. A. T. Doultbee, wounded'
Captain O. S. W. Nugent, wounded: Captain A. R. M. Stuart Wortley,
wounded; Lieutenant F. M. Crum, -wounded; Lieutenant R. Johnstone.'
wounded; Lieutenant G. H. Martin, wounded.
Eighteenth Hussarsâ Second Lieutenant H. A. Cape, wounded; Second
Lieutenant A. C. McLachlen, wounded; Second Lieutenant E. H. Bayford,
wounded.
The list of officers killed and wounded shows that while the British victory
was complete it was bought at a heavy price. This heavy loss among the
officers was due to their valiant conduct in sticking; to the traditions of the
British army and refusing to use the cover of which the men availed them
selves during the storming of the Boer position. In the rank and file the
Hussars had seven wounded, the artillery one killed and three wounded, the
Leicestershire Regiment one wounded, the King's Rifles eleven killed and
sixty-eight wounded, the Irish Fusileers fourteen killed and thirty wounded.

I doughty American, General Otis, in send
; ing out bulletins of victory in which he
I kills off seven times as many Filipinos as
i the whole insurgent army contains,
though he does not dare to go beyond the
vicinity of Manila."
The press censorship instituted In Natal
is characterized as "worse than Russian."
The Government, however, is determined
to preserve its neutrality. Dr. Leyds, the
representative of the Transvaal in Eu
rope was on the point of coming^ to Ber
lin this week to make an attempt to influ
ence Germany's policy. He notified Count
yon Bulow, the German Minister of For
eign Affairs, who, after conferring with
! the Emperor on Tuesday, telegraphed to
I Dr. Leyds a hint that a visit Just now
would be slightly pmbarrassing and that
his purpose would certainly not be fur
thered by it.
It is another question, however, whether
this attitude of strict neutrality is wise.
A member of the Russian Embassy said
to the Associated Press correspondent:
"The steps for the preservation of peace
undertaken by Russia are likely to mis
' carry because Germany just now adheres
:to her Anglophile policy- Germany's at-
I titude alone made Mr. Chamberlain's bold
advance possible. Germany is in a meas
ure responsible for the prospective subjec
tion of the Transvaal. She is on the point
of earning substantial rewards from Eng
land, and not only in Africa, but these
garhs will not counterbalance the losses
she will sustain elsewhere because of her
aid to England. It will be Germany's do
ing if England soon becomes all-powerful
in Africa and Germany will be the first to
feel the consequences."

NEW HOME FOR
DEWEY CHOSEN
Admiral Is Well Pleased
With It.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, WELLING
TON HOTEL, WASHINGTON, Oct. 21.â
Admiral Dewey will be at home next week
in the house presented to him by the
American people. As a result of his in
spection or more than fifty houses the
choice of the admiral has fallen upon the
handsome Fitch residence at 1747 Rhode
Island avenue, Northwest. The Dewey
home fund committee has perfected ar
rangements for the purchase of the house,
and when the check is drawn in favor of
James E. Fitch, a prominent real estate
owner of this city, it will call for the pay
ment to him of practically $50,iXK) f almost
the entire amount of subscriptions re
ceived. In anticipation of occupying the
house on Monday, Admiral Dewey has
bougiit the winter's coal bupply aJid his
marketing.
The admiral Is delighted with his new
home ami took great satisfaction in show
ing it to-day to his intimate friends, li
1b situated in the fashionable section of
Washington, within a square of Secretary
Root's home. Just around the corner on
Connecticut avenue are the British and
Italian embassies and the Brazilian Lega
tion, and only a few doors away on
Rhode Island avenue is the Austro-llun
garian Legation. The Metropolitan Club,
the admiral's lounging place, is only a few
squuies distant, it is altogether a de
lightful neighborhood, and the house is in
keÂ» ping with it.
Thf house, of brick construction, with
brownstone trimmings, was built twelve
years ago by Mr. Fitch, and has been oc
cupied by him continually, with the excep
tion of the past year, when it was leased
unfurnished to an acquaintance. It has
the frontage, unusually ample for a city
house, of 27 feet, and extends back 72 feet,
with a sweep of apartments that is un
broken from the front to the rear. It com
prises seventeen rooms and four bath
rooms. The iirst floor Is divided into three
large rooms, the parlor, library and dining
room. The parlor is furnished In white
ajid gold, the library is old nnk and the
dining room in mahogany. The rooms are
separated by wide folding doors. The two
upper floors are arranged as sleeping
apartments. There is a back yaru
feet deep which extends to an alley where
there is no building, but the admiral has
made arrangements for purchasing a sta
ble belonging to an adjoining house, in
which he will keep his horses. It is his
intention to devote considerable time to
riding.
The design of the house is quiet, but the
general effect is pleasing and dignified. A
wide plaza lies in front of the house,
formed by the junction of M street and
Rhode Isfand and Connecticut avenues.
The home fund committee has remaining
a couple of thousand dollars which will be
expended in the interior finishings. The
present furniture, with the exception of a
few old pieces, will be kept, it being in ex
cellent condition and pretentious in char
acter. The admiral is very well pleased
with it.
By advice of his physician Admiral
Dewey has canceled hi? proposed trips to
Philadelphia and Atlanta and will accept
no more Invitations before next spring.
RABBIT'S CARCASS
WAS HIS SALVATION
Ten- Year-Old Boy at Chileno Valley
Has a Narrow Escape From
Death.
SAX RAFAEL, Oct. 21.â Colonel Buirey
of the Marin County Toscin returned
from a professional trip throughout the
upper part of the county to-day and re
lates a thrilling tale, in which a panther
or California lion cuts a prominent fig
ure, and the 10-year-old Bon of Charles Ol
cutt of Chileno Valley took a leading
part.
While hunting on the Walker ranch
ycung Orcutt shot a jarkrabbit and was
tibout to bag his game when a large pan
ther bounded out of the brush and
pounced upon the dead rabbit.
Dropping his shotgun, the boy ran for
home, a half mile distant. The panther
delayed pursuing him to eat the rabbit
ana young Oroutt got near enoufrn to
heme to fall into the company of two
deer hounds belonging to his father. The
panther was then in pursuit, but slunk
avay when the dogs approached.
Pc.nthers seem to be numerous in cer
tain districts of Marin County at present,
as well as bears. A short time ago two
panthers had a terrific combat with a
seallon on Hog Island at the mouth of
Tarnales bay, and dairymen near Camp
Ta>lcr and Tocaloma have recently suf
fered from the depredations of a cinna
mon bear.
SLOT MACHINE TEST CASE.
Contention Made That Stockton Laws
Cannot Be Enforced.
STOCKTON, Oct. 21.â The slot machine
test case -was argued before Judge Jones
this morning on jULbeaa corpus proceed
ing's. The validity of the ordinance was
attacked upon the rather sensational
grounds that the charter of the city of
Stockton does not provide that the city
may fix the penalty of Imprisonment for
tho violation of any of the city ordin
ances. It is the only city charter In the
State that does not contain a clause to
that effect.
This contention came in the nature of
a surprise to both tho court and the at
torneys for the city and Judge Jones in
timated that while the contention might
be well founded public policy would be
better subserved should he decide the
point not well taken.
A decision on tills point favorable to
the contestant would mean that the city
Is without power to fix any penalties
other than a fine or forfeiture for the
violation of any of her laws. The con
tention of defendant's counsel was tb&t
the Legislature has no power by joint
resolution to create a pc-nal offense; that
the city of Stockton has not been given
power through its charter to create a
penal offense, and that if it has the
power it has not taken advantage of it
and made provision for the pun-ishment
by imprisonment of such an offense by
ordinance. The case was submitted this
afternoon and Judge Jones announced
that he would render a decision next
Monday morning at 9 o'clock.
GERMANY PROPOSES
DIVISION OF SAMOA
WASHINGTON, Oct. StLâ Propositions
for partitioning the Samoan Islands
among the three powers signatory to the
Berlin tre;ity have not come from tha
United States, as is announced in Berlin,
but from Germany. As stated this morn
ing the negotiations on this point are
only in the preliminary stage and the
policy of this Government has as yet
not been definitely determined. It is ap
parent, however, from what I have been
able to learn that the officials here do not
look unfavorably upon the suggestion
that this Government take Tutuila and
Manua, Germany Upolu and Great
Britain Savaii and Rose Island: though
in return for the withdrawal of the Uni
ted States from Upqlu it is stated that
some further concessions should be made
by Germany.
It ia evident from the feeling in Ger
man diplomatic circles that the German
Government is strongly supporting the
proposition for partitioning the islands,
it iM.-iu^ urged that this is the only solu
tion which will bring about a settled con
dition in the group. This Government is
tired of the constant turmoil prevailing
in the islands, with its constant embar
rassment, and, provided American Inter
ests are duly conserved, it sees no gÂ»od
i for remaining in t'polu. The peo
ple of the Island or' Tutuila are very
friendly to the American republic and are
peaceably tnclin* â¢!.
ler the direction of Rear Admiral
Bradford of the Bureau of Equipment
i- rable improvements have been
at Pago Pago, and, within a few
munths, an excellent coaling station, nat
urally well protected, will have been es
tablished. The fact of the establishment
of such a station makes the island ihe
natural property of the United States,
and it is this reason which has doubtless
led to the suggestion that the United
â  s occupy Tutuila permanently. It
is understood that like the United States,
Great Britain will claim compensation
from Germany in case it shall be deter
mined that the last-named power shall
take possession of Upolu, in addition to
the island Savaii and the little island
known as Rose Island, which is to the
eastward of Savaii. Just what the char
acter of this compensation will be Is a
matter to be determined when the three
Powers have formally agreed to forever
settle the Samoan question by partition
ing the islands between them.

SMITH WITS
NEW CANDIDATES
Plan to Solve the Sen
atorial Question.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
BAKERSFIELD, Oct. 21.-The Morning
Echo, Senator Smith's paper, on the sub
ject of the Senatorial question and call
ing an extra session of Legislature, will
say this morning, after some prelimi
naries:
Something must be done, to our mind. The
first thing is to clear the field of all candidates
who, up to the close ot" the legislative session,
wore being pressed for the place. If there is
an i-xtra session, and Mr. Grant's friends re
main faithful to him, they can expect nothing
lesfl from the adherents of Mr. Burns or Gen
eral Barnes, and vice versa. For more than
two months every effort was made to get ad
herents of these candidates to go over to the
standards of others, but scarcely a man moved.
What hope Is there that they would do so now?
But if all these candidates will withdraw, If
they will sacrifice "lor the present, at least,"
their personal ambitions for the good of the
country. State and party, this matter can be
settled In short order. Or, if any or all of
these candidates decline to retire, the members
ot th,Â» Legislature can accomplish the same
thing hy agreeing to withdraw their respective
allegiances on condition that all the others do
the same. By either route the same end will
be reached, namely, a new field with a chance
for new leaders. This is a course which will
tall for sacrifices on the part of former can
didates and members of the Legislature, but
as some must forego their preferences why
should not all do so and start again on an
equal footing?
The fairness of this proposition Is made clear
by remembering that none of the candidates be
came such in response to a demand from the
people. If our memnry serves us aright not a
county or district Instructed its nominee for
the Legislative office to support either Grant,
Barnes. Scott or Burns, tyrant and General
Barn<?6 announced their candidacy before elec
tion, and to th^e extent of their votes may
be said to have received some indorsement by
the people; but neither Scott nor Colonel Burns
caji claim that much. Pn It may be said that
all, practically, were self-made candidatesâ a
fact not to their discredit, but one which, at
this time, loosens their grip upon the honor.
The sacrifice will not be altogether on can
didates. ManY of the members of the Legis
lature and many citizens in private liiV will
feel keen disappointment attendant upon the
withdrawal of their favorite. But, as before
stated, the situation demands sacrifices, and
equity calls for equal sacrifices all along the
line.
If th? foregoing plans should be adopted and
acted ucon there is no reason to doubt that a
Senator would be elected without delay That
result would have followed during the" regular
session if the decks could have been cleared.
No bad feeling or prejudices would be engen
dered between the members of the Legisla
ture and they could sit down to a solution oi
the question with ease and good feeling. Un
der such circumstances the Govornor should,
call an extra session. He acts wisely In no*
calling it till he is well assured that an elec
tion will Â»peedlly follow.
SKIRMISH WITH YAQUIS.
ORTIZ, State of Sonora, Mexico, Oct. |
21.â The large force of troops commanded ;
by General Torres has advanced toward j
Bahuarlpa during the past week. A num- |
ber of skirmishes have taken place be- !
tween scouting parties and small bands '
of Yaqui Indians, but no report is made i
of the number of casualties. It is thought
frtta this that the main troops suffered
no losses.
The Indians still retain their strong po- <
sltion near Sahuaripa and are evidently !
prepared for the attack by General '
Torres' forces, which will probably be !
made next week. It is reported that one
regiment of reinforcements ha*s arrived
at the mouth of the Yaqui River from |
Mazatlan and that they will be marched ;
overland to join General Torres' men.

Press of the Empire Excited Over the
Intimation That Germany
May Withdraw From the
â¢ Islands.
Copyrighted, 1539, by the Associated Press.
BERLIN, Oct. 21.â The public really
has been more interested this week in the
Samoan question than in the war. The
interest taken in these small islands re
vives at the slightest bit of m\vs of an
insignificant change in the situation, and
the papers have devoted a great amount
of space to the subject.
Tho correspondent of the Associated
Press saw Baron yon Sternberg â â¢:;
Wednesday and understands that there
is no doubt that the negotiations pending
will soon lead to a satisfactory settle
ment. The correspondent also learns
from the Foreign Office that the Minister
of Foreign Affairs, Count yon Buelow,
adheres to his determination to secure
for Germany the islands, or the most
valuable part of them. The informant of
the correspondent added that in ho
out for this the Minister was mainly !'â :
lowing the almost unanimously expn
demands of the public. But, it is added,
it must not be understood that he would
not sanction, if the present wish wei â¢
found to be unrealizable, some other rea
son.
Andrew D. White, the United States
Embassador, tells the correspondent that
the full report of the great commit sii. a
shows that the present status of the isl
ands is untenable for any length of time,
though satisfactory at present. The ne
gotiations are only in their initial stage,
and months probably will be required to
bring about a satisfactory solution. The
three Governments are showing the best
spirit and no serious differences have yet
arisen. The solutions mentioned as feas
ible are the partition of the islands or the
retirement of either Great Britain or Ger
raany, with adequate compensation else
where.
The entire German press is greatly ex
cited at the mere mention of the possi
bility of Germany's retirement from Sa
moa and a number of the influential
papers are fairly in a rage, declaring it
is a point of honor for Germany t" hold
her ground and not yield up her i
1.. -ither Great Britain or the United
Btstes.
Emperor William's trio to Hamburg on
Weinesday sho.v.-i !mw popular he is
there. During his drive in the eveulng
through the streets he was enthusiast
ically greeted by enormous crowds of
pc >ple. His speech at the dinner is re
garded as belns one of the ilnest and
most powerful efforts of his Majesty.
and the impression it made can hardly
be overestimated. It will enormously
stimulate public sentiment in favor of a
big navy, which was doubtless the pur
if the speech, and it is expected an
other naval bill will soon be presented in
the Reichstag.
The correspondent of the Associated
Press learns what quite escaned the pub
lic, that the Emperor also made a brief
address to the crew and officers of the
Gorman warship Falke. recently in Sa
moan waters, in which his Majesty
praised their devotion to duty, and added:
"Lot us hope that the day may not be
distant when Germany will have larger,
more powerful ships and more of them
to send out on the far seas for the pro
tection of her interests and that all other
nations will respect her just wishes and
rights."

WE ARE
NOW BORING
FOR OIL!
If a company Is operating fn a
proven oil district â where oil wells
existâ and there are many wells ad-
joining its property, don't you
think these facts the best of evi-
dence that the company's chances
for "striking oil" are most excel-
lent?
These are claims on which this
company hope to interest intending
investors in oil stock; Lot us
prove to you that our claims are
true. We are now boring our first
well and stock will be sold until
further notice at $1 00 per share.

John R. Gentry Lowers the
Coast Record at Los
Angeles.
Special Dispar.-h to The Call.
LOS ANGELES. Oct. 21.â excite-,
ment of horse racing has "caught on" in
Los Angeles. When the bell rang this
afternoon, calling the horses for the first
race at Agricultural Park, 16,000 persona
were in attendance and a better natured
crowd never assembled on any track.
The weather was perfect, the track was
in excellent condition and the card fur
nished by the District Agricultural Asso
ciation Nib. 6 for Its first meeting this
season received deserved appreciation.
The feature of the day's sport was the
: free-for all pace, for a purse of $800u, the
â  gi.-ints of the pacing turf, Joe Patchen,
; John R. Gentry and Anaconda, being the
contestants. The race was for the best
i two in three heats. Patchen was the fa
vorite, but he finished no better than a
close third in each heat, both of which
were won by John K. Gentry in 2:05 and
2:04, respectively. This breaks the coast
record of 2:07, made by Sllkwood at Santa
Ana.
in the first heat Anaconda led from the
1 start to the stretch, Patchen being a
close second, with Gentry at his wheel:
Down the stretch Andrews urged Gentry
ahead and he finished the race a necK
ahead of Anaconda, Patchen being a
; sulky's length behind Anaconda. The
iiuurter in this heat was paced in 31% sec
onds, the half in l:02& the three-quarters
in 1:36 and the mile in 2:05.
In the second heat Gentry led from start
to nnish. Anaconda occupied second place
throughout and Patchen brougnt up in
the rear. It was a pretty contest and
appeared to be anybody's race, so close
were the horses bunched, but the sensa
tional spurt was maintained to the wire
and the great Bon of Ashland \Vilkes cut
another notch in his sulky. The time at
the quarter was 31%; at the half. 1:01%, at
the three-quarters 1:33% and the finish
In t A*. 2:20 class P ace Martha Whips, a
prohibitive favorite, won in straight
heats.
Judging from the odds, Burmah was
looked upon as the "lobster" In the hurdle
handicap, but ho won easily from P F

In the six-furlong event there were
twelve entries. In coming down the back
etretch three Jockeys were thrown, "Willis
on Beaumonde receiving serious Injuries
about the head. The other two jockeys
escaped with a severe shaking up.

WASHINGTON, Oct. 21.â The secretary
of the Navy received the following from
Admiral Watson at Manila to-day:
"On October 16 the insurgents surprised
a bum's cri W of four men from the gun
boat Mariveles, who, under a white flag,
wore landing non-combatants from the
captured proa at Sicogol Island. William
Barraschka, boatswain's mate, first class,
was captured. An armed crew of ten at

N. Hoar, landsman, was fatally wounded;
Frederick Anderson, apprentice, first
class, severely wounded in the groin, and
Nicholas Farre, cockswain, wounded m
the lefi leg. The Concord and Mariveles
will punish if possible."
General Otis has notified the War De
partmenl of the arrival at Manila of the
transports Sheridan and George W. Elder.
The former carried the Thirtieth Volun
- and some recruits. The latter had
on board nineteen officers and 388 enlisted
men. There were no casualties on either

PHILIPPINE COMMISSION
TO MEET M'KINLEY
WASHINGTON, Oct. 21.â Arrangements
have been perfected by the State Depart
ment for a meeting of the Philippine com
mission on either Monday or Tuesday, in
Washington. A telegram received by Sec
retary Hay announces thai Colonel Denby
and Professor Worcester will reach this
<ity on Monday. -Mr. Bchurman, the pres-
Ident of the commission, has been direct
ed to come and meet his colleagues and
tary 1.",!^ lias given orders t" Ad
miral Dewey assigning him to special
duty in connection with tne commission.
The only absentee, therefore, will be Gen
eral Otis, who has confided his views to
his associates and who doubtless will be
frequentlj communicated with by cable,
it Is expected the President will see
Colonel Denby and Professor Worcester
Immediately upon their arrival and learn
thecondition of affairs at the timeof their
departure. Of course cable advices have
been received, but they do not show that
important change in the situation
has taken place since the departure of
the two commissioners, with the execution
of the new military move made by Gen
eral Otis. Therefore, the news that Colo
nel I>et,by and Professor Worcester
brought will be fresh and doubtless will
be useful In connection with the work of
the commission.
The commission will recommend the
charai ivernment for the several
tribes in the archipelago and will report
exhaustively upon the sociological, indus
â¢ 'inic conditions prevailing
on the islands. The views of the com
mission will be useful to the President in
â¢reparation of his forthcoming mes
sage.
Admiral Dewey believes that the cam
paign which General Otis has begun north

"It i^ true," said he, "that a pootl many
churches have been looted and stripped.

NO OFFERS MADE FOR
AGRICULTURAL PARK
Futurity Stake to Be Changed to a
Stallion Nomination Stake
Open to All.
SACRAMENTO, Oct. 21.â A meeting of
the directors of the State Board of Agri
culture was held to-day, when a state
ment of the financial condition of affairs
vras submit toil, it showed a very ploas
ii's; result, owing to the groat success of
tho late State Fair. Bills amounting to
$11,000 were audited.
The committee on the sale of Agricul
tural Park reported thnt it had been un
able to get ft satisfactory bid for the
property, or to get an offer to exchange
a new Bite for the present one. The rec
ommendation was made thai the old park
be use* until :i satisfactory offer is ob
tained, and the probabilities are that the
society v.- ill continue to use the present
park for some time to come.
The directors decided to change the
Futurity stake heretofore offered by the
society to a stallion nomination stake,
open to all stallions. Nominations are to
be made before January 1, 1900. The
produce of mares bred in ISX9 are eligible
and must be named before January 1,
ISOL The colts are to race as two-year
olds at the fair in 1902. This is expected
to be one of the richest stakes ever run
in California, and a number of nomina
tions by Eastern breeders will be made.

DR. HYDE DIES AT
HIS HONOLULU HOME
Passing of the Ecclesiastic Who Assailed
the Memory of the Late Father
Damien.
THE LATE CHARLES McEWEN HYDE.
HONOLULU, Oct 14.â Rev. Charles McEwen Hyde, D.D., died at 8:30 o'clock
lust evening. II" was the son of Joseph Hyde and was born in New York
City in I^2. Ho graduated at Williams College, Massachusetts, and took
his theological course partly in Tnion Theological Seminary of New
York city ami partly at Princeton, New Jersey.
Tils lirst pastorate was at Brimfleld, Mass, where he met and married Miss
Mary Knight, a daughter of Dr. Knight, who survives him. His next pastorate
whs in the Center Congregational Church of Haverhill, Mass. In the summer of
1877 he was sent to Hawaii as a missionary of the American Board of Com
mis*i<'Tvrs :'.'!â¢ Foreign Missions, and since that time has been among the most
zealous and capable of the board's workers. He organized the North Pacific In
stitute and broadened the sphere of missionary labor.
To the world at large Dr. Hyde became known through his venomous at
tacks upon the memory of the late Father Damien, the martyr of Molokai, fol
lowed by the open letter of the late Robert Louis Stevenson in the controversy of
1889-90, which flayed him alive and then boiled him in oil.
The decea i â¢ ! was a man of great mental endowment, with a very wide range
of knowledge and power of thought. He had great executive ability but no prac
tical business capacity. Crafty and subtle, linn and determined, bigotedly re
ligious, he was a type of the men who lived and wielded power two or three
hundred : '^< l Puritans of Cromwell ami New Kngland and the Jesuits
who ruled France with the portfolios of State. His lifr> was one long adaptation
of the axiom, "the end justifies the means." He was the secret wirepuller behind
the Mole administration from the very inception of the annexation movement,
and his name was even mentioned for the first Presidency.
Few men have been so prominent In Hawaiian clerical life as the late Dr.
Hyde, for he bold trusteeships in most of our ecclesiastical, educational and
n>Nsionary institutions, and discharged his duty conscientiously, but his was a
stern character, that leaves but few pleasant memories behind, and he will not
be mourned ns affectionately as the worthy John Phillips, the plumber, whose
funeral to-morrow under Masonic and Governmental auspices will overshadow
thai of Pr. Hyde, although to the latter will flock all the missionary societies
of the city.

Work of Temperance
Union Convention.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SEATTLE, Wash., Oct. âIn consid
eration of three important amendments to
the constitution of the organization and in
celebrating the silver jubilee of the soci
ety, the delegates to the Women's Chris
tian Temperance Union Convention pabsed
the second day of the session. Two of
three amendments were adopted. One of
these removes the headquarters of the na
tional organization from Chicago, where
they have been located for many years,
to Evansville, 111., at Rest Cottage, the
late home ot Miss Frances E. Willaid.
The amendment was adopted after a long
and at limes heated debate, in which
much feeling was manifested. \\ hen the
vote was taken, shortly after noon It
stood 174 for the amendment and 22
against It. â_. . . ..
No little interest was manifested In the
debate over the amendment making na
tional organizers members of the execu
tive committee of the union. It was
voted down after considerable debate by
a two-thirds vote.
Another amendment making State sec
retaries of the Loyal Temperance Legion
ex-officlo delegates to national conven
tions was carried without opposition.
The afternoon programme was largely
given over to the celebration of the twen
ty-fifth anniversary of the formation of
the union.
Mrs Mary B. Reese of this city, who
nominated Miss Willard for president of
the union at the first convention (which
nomination she declined), spoke to the
convention. During the remainder of the
afternoon the convention listened to short
addresses from the State superintendents
and visitors. ,

LOS ANGELES, Oct. 21.â The weather
to-night is somewhat cloudy and indica
tions are favorable for rain at an early
hour to-morrow. Rain began falling this
evening at Santa Barbara with every in
dication of continuing through the night
and the storm appears to be moving
southward. While some damage resulted
from the recent rain, the benefits were
much greater; the water supply was in
creased; land put in condition for farm
ing operations, which are becoming ac
tive, and a tone of confidence Imparted
to business generally. Timely warnings
of the storm prevented damage to fruits
and raisins, where advantage was taken
of the information. Farmers and orch
ardists in Southern California are pre
pared for rain whenever it may arrive.
SANTA CRUZ, Oct, 21.â The rainfall
last night was unprecedented for Octo
ber and the fall lust night was more than
for the entire month of October for the
past fÂ»n years. The damage to the apple
and grape crops was heavy. The ungath
ered grape crop was almost entirely de
stroyed and grape owners are heavy los
rrs. as the rain will crack all the ripe
table grapes on the vines.
GILROT, Oct 21. -Rain began falling
gently about midnight, gradually increas
ing to a heavy downpour, and has fallen
Steadily all day and will probably con

The precipitation, here was ]25 inches

filled the rivers below. The rainfall for
the storm is 2.23 inches, for the season
3.75 inches. The same fall was registered
In 1894.
STOCKTON, Oct. 21.â The rainfall fir
the storm in Stockton up to this eveninr
measured 1.51 inches, making 2.35 lncho'
for the momh and 2.40 for the season
Last year :it this time the fall was 1.10
inches. The heavy storm has done con
siderable damage, because many farmers
had grain stacked and in sacks in their
fields and a large amount of hay was ex
posed. This is the heaviest October rain
fiill in many years and farmers were
wholly unprepared for it.
BUISUN, Oct 21.â The rainfall to date
for this season is 3.16 inches in this vicin

MILTON, Oct. 21.â A heavy rain fell

CUR AND A COWARD
Jackson Says Sacramento Will
Not Hold Them Both an! Offers
to Fight With Any Weapon.
SACRAMENTO. Oct. 21.â George W. |
Jackson, superintendent of the Capital j
Gas Company, met Dr. G. B. N. Clow, a '
local physician, near the Golden Eagle
Hotel to-day and shoving him against
the side of a building informed him that
the town was not big enough to hold
them both. Jackson Is one of the best
known and most respected citizens of
Sacramento. He is the present exalted I
ruler of the Lodge of Elks and ur. Clow j
is the past exalted ruler of the same [
! lodge.
The exciting episode of to-day gTows
out of an incident in the suit of Miss
Amanda Austin against the estate of Jef- j
ferson Wilcoxson, now pending in the '
Superior Court. Mrs. Jackson was a ;
strong witness In behalf of Miss Austin,
who sues for the recovery of $150,000 from
the Wilcoxson heirs. On Thursday bhe
filed an affidavit in court accusing Dr.
G. B. N. Clow of having visited her home
j and offered her a consideration if she
! should change her testimony so as to be
less favorable to Miss Austin. Dr. Clow,
so the affidavit sets forth, told her that
he had been sent by an Elk and that it
i was not unusual for cases to be adjusted
In that manner. Mrs. Jackson promptly
resented the offer and Informed her hus
band, who advised the course she subse
quently followed.
Dr. G. B. N. Clow, In an Interview In
last night's Bee, said that while he had
visited the Jackson residence it was to
see Mr. Jackson on lodge matters and
that while waiting for him he had con

LIKE A LOT
OF NOVICES
Oakland Saves Itself From
Defeat by "Horse-PJay" on

Cal Swing's collection of Dudes pave
! a very bad account of themselves in yea

tt at the hands of Uncle Honry's ag
i gregation staring them In the face they
suddenly became fearful that their pretty
uniforms would be damaged by a light
: shower and like small boys "would not
: play, nohow." I'mpire O'Connell, spurred
on by tho requests of a score of "fans,"
ordered the Athenians to play ball, but
they did so in such a listless way as to de
j lay the game long enough for a shower to
' fall and drive them to points of shelter.
â  According to the National League rules,
had the t'nme been stopped by rain after
j the fifth Innlnp, the side leading would
[be declared the winner?. Had Oakland
j permitted the game to take Its usual
\ course San Francisco would have had an
i other victory to add to Its percentage col
umn.
The day was not an auspicious one for
ball playing, but about 300 enthusiasts
journeyed to the park in the hope of see
ing a" game. They v/"re disappointed.

subjects, but that he had not tried to
influence her testimony nor had he *aid
he had been sent to see her by an Elk.
The mildest interpretation that could be
put upon the Interview was that Dr. Clow
considered Mrs. Jackson had made a mis
take.
Jackson and Clow met to-day as stated
for the first time since the interview ap
peared in the Bee. Mr. Jackson inus de
scribes what followed: "Clow approached
me with a smile on his face and was go
ing to speak to me. I put my fist under
his chin, pushed him back against the
wall and said: 'You dirty cur, you. You
contemptible coward. You come to me
with a smile on your face, you contempt
ible cur.' I then told him that he wat> a
coward and that I would fight him at any
time he said with guns or pistols or
knives. I told him that the town was not
big enough to hold us both and that
every time I met him I would talk to
him just as I was then doing, even if I
met him two or three times a day even'
day in the week. I then called him a cur
and a coward and I again declared that
I would repeat what I said every time I
saw him."
Judge Ellison has taken notice of the
affidavit sworn to by Mrs. Jackson by
Issuing a citation for Dr. Clow to appear
in court on November 6 and show cause
why he should, not be punished for con

a single to left. Krug singled also and
Brockhoff crossed the plate. Sullivan and
Courtney were easy outs.
Oakland did nothing when it came to
bat and in the third San Francisco added
two more to its seorp. making things look
blue for Oakland. Donovan saved his
team from a whitewash by knocking a
two-bagger and scoring Borchers, who
was permitted to walk to first.
A slight shower began to fall during the
next Inning and the "Dudes" did every
thing in their power to delay the playing.
Borchers was the ringleader in this con
spiracy. To the spectators It seemed that
he did not want a losing game to his
credit. Slow as he is in delivering the
ba.ll to the batter, yesterday he was fun
er< al in his work. O'Connell ordered him
to "play ball" time and again. Before
doing so every "Dude" trotted off the
Held to get his red sweater. A heavier
shower then pot in its work and O'Con
nell called the game for twenty minutes,
in the hope it would pass off. At the
expiration of the time limit he forced the
game. San Francisco, 1n Its attempt to
make it five Innings, simply fanned at the
hall. Seeing that the game was becom
ing a hippodrome the umpire postponed
hostilities.
Unsolicited the management gave the
spectators rain checks, which will entitle
them to seeing this afternoon's game. If
the weather holds good Sacramento and
Santa <'ruz will play at 10:30 this morn
ing at Recreation Park. In the afternoon
S;m Francisco and Oakland will again try
conclusions. The following Bcore will
show how the game was going when time

What your kidneys need is a gentle, healing, tonic influence)
that will soothe their irritability and gently regulate them.
The only thing that will do this is Dr. Kilmer's Swamp-Root,

all constitutional diseases have their beginning in the disorder of
these useful organs.
What more natural?
The Kidneys filter and purify the blood. \
When they don't your whole body
must suffer.
If you are sick, doctor your kidneys,
because as soon as they are well they
will help all the other organs to health.
The mild and extraordinary effect of
Dr. Kilmer's Swamp-Root, the great
kidney remedy, is soon realized. It
stands the highest for its wonderful
cures of the most distressing cases and
is sold by druggists in fifty-cent and
one-dollar bottles. Make a note of the

DIED IN A PRISON CELL.
Mrs. Pauline Hornech Succumbed to
a Violent Fit Brought on by-
Alcoholism.
Mrs. Pauline Hornech, wife of F. Hor
nech who lives In the rear of 230 Natoma
street, was taken to the City Prison Fri
day morning on a warrant sworn out by j
her husbanij, charging her with being a |
"common drunkard. 11 Shortly after two \
o'clock yesterday morning she was seized j
with a violent fit In her cell and Desk j
Sergeant Bidwell sent her to the Receiv
ing Hospital in the patrol wagon. Pr.
Starr, an Interne, treated her for alco
holism and dressed her nose, which had
been contused by her fall. He sent her
back to the prison.
Shortly before 6 o'clock she was seized !
with another violent fit and Sergeant Bid- j
well telephoned to the hospital and Dr. j
Starr called at the prison. The woman |
died in a few minutes. Her body was j
taken to the Morgue, and as there were
rumors that her husband had beaten her
from the fact that there were bruises on
her body. Detective Cody was detailed on
the case. The husband denied beating
her and the neighbors said that In her
drunken orgies she used to fall over the
furniture and injure herself. The autopsy
showed that her death was entirely due to
alcoholism and the bruises on the body
had nothing to do with it.
Captain Seymour was indignant at the
hospital attaches sending the woman
back to the prison Instead of giving her
a bed there and attend to her as her life
might have been saved. There is con
stant friction between the prison officials
and hospital attaches over such cases.
"When the woman was brought to the
hospital," said Dr. Starr last night, "she
was not in a dying condition. She walked
out of the patrol wagon and into the
operating room. T prescribed for her and j
suggested to the officer that she be al- j

The famous new discovery, Swamp-
Root, has been tested In so many ways,
in hospital work, in private practice,
among the helpless too poor to pur-
chase relief, and has proved so suc-

rangement has been made by which all
readers of The Call, who have not al-
ready tried it, may have a sample bot-
tle sent absolutely free by mail. Also
a book telling more about Swamp-Root
and containing some of the thousands
upon thousands of testimonial letters
received from men and women who owe
their good health, in fact, their very
lives, to the wonderful curative prop-

H. E. HUNTINGTON COMES
TO REASSUME HIS SWAY
THE NEPHEW OF THE PRESI
DENT AGAIN IN POWER.
Wise Ones Look Forward to Some
Important Changes Among
Southern Pacific Officials.
H E. Huntirgton, director of t..e
Southern Pacific Company and nephew |
of his uncle, arrived in the city yester- j
day from New York, where, as he puts
it, he has been for some time past, "en- j
joying a vacation." With him came his
motherland Miss Clara Huntington. The |
party was due to arrive on the train i
scheduled to arrive at 9:45 a. m., but, j
as usual, the cars rolled in so late as to
make it nearly evening before Mr. Hunt- j
ington reached his home on Jackson
Btreet.
When seen last night at his house Mr.
Huntington said he did not come out j
here to have anything to do with the !
Southern Pacific beyond the duties which ;
his position as director entailed. He did I
not know what had taken General Man
ager Kruttschnltt to Chicago nor could

himself or the "Discriminator" being ap
pointed to the second vice presidency
when Mr. Crocker shall leave that office
vacant. He did not even know that Mr.
Crocker had sold out his stock. He had
heard the report and believed it to bo
well founded, but he had no personal
knowledge of the transaction. He did
not know when C. P. Huntlngton would
favor the coast with a visit.
Mr. Huntington said that he would not
assume the position of assistant to the
president. He would, so he said, only
retain his connection with the company
through his present position as a direc
tor. Those who are generally considered
wise ones say otherwise, however.
According to these gentlemen Mr. Hunt
ington will soon be restored to either his
old place or be appointed to the second
vice presidency. For a while he may be
allowed to remain without any official
title, but that will not interfere with his
power. He has been sent out here to rep
resent his uncle and his place Is so well
established and his powers so thoroughly
I recognized that when he takes his place
at his desk to-morrow morning it w..l

building on Montgomery street, where the
balance of power will be concentrated.
These wise ones say also that Krutt
schnltt Ib soon to receive some signal
! mark of the consideration in which he is
held by Mr. Huntington. Kruttschnltt is
now in Chicago and will probably go on
to New York before he returns. There Is
nothing now doing which should carry
him so far afield and the knowing ones
say that when he returns he will carry
with him the promise of being made sec
ond ricÂ« president or of receiving gome
other elevation In rank even though it
should be necessary to create a brand
new office for his special benefit.
BITTEN BY WALLACE.
The Vicious Brute Attacks Frank
Kent, Its Keeper.
Frank Kent, who has charge of the
menagerie at the Chutes, attempted to
make friends with Wallace, the ferocious
Hon. Friday night and was severely bit
ten on the right hand. Kent approached
the brute and started to pet it. Instantly
Wallace charged on him, catching his
hand in his jaws.
Kent lustily screamed, which had the
effect of frightening off the lion. Had he
not screamed Kent believes that he would
have had his arm bitten off. As it was
his hand was severely cut by coming in
contact with the lion's teeth and he was
compelled to at once seek medical aid.
Dairyman Expires Suddenly.
George Michaelis, a dairyman residing
at 3117 Sacramento street, died suddenly
yesterday morning. Michaells was mak
ing preparations to accompany his wife
on a trip out of town, when he suddenly
keeled over and died in a few moments.
He had been suffering from heart failure
for some time, and to this ailment his
death is attributed. Deceased was a na
tive of Germany and 66 years . of age.
His widow and several children survive
him,

HEAD OF THE CHURCH.
Bishop Potter of New York Here En
Route to Honolulu.
Right Rev. H. C. Potter, Bishop of
New York and premier Episcopal prelate
of the United States, arrived in this city
last evening and registered at the Occi
dental, en route to Honolulu and thence
around the world, via Japan, China, In
dia and the Suez canal. Bishop Potter is
a gentleman of polished manner, great
affability and possessed of a personal
magnetism that makes Itself felt as soon
as one comes into his presence.
When seen last evening at his hotel
Bishop Potter said that his present trip
was taken with the twofold purpose of
preparing the way for the American
House of Bishops to take over the dio
cese of Hawaii and to consummate a trip
around the world that he has long had
In contemplation.
When the Hawaiian Islands were und^r
a government of their own the diocese
was presided over by an Anglican Bishop.
But now that they have become Unite*
States territory they will pass under the
authority of the American. Episcopal
church, and it is to prepare the way for
this change that the Bishop is now Jour
neying toward Honolulu.
From Honolulu Bishop Potter will jour
ney to Japan and around the world. Ho
is as yet undecided as to whether or not
he will visit Manila, but it is more than
Hkely that he will see something of the
island of Luzon, particularly as he is a
strong anti-expansionist and will natur
ally want to thoroughly inform himself
on all matters pertaining to Uncle Sam's
new acquisitions. While on his way out
to this coast Bishop Potter delivered an
address at St. Paul against imperialism
which created a sensation and gave a
blow to the politicians who see in the
Philippines an opportunity for gain,
which they will be some time in getting 1
ovr.
The Bishop will preach at this mnrn
lng"s service at Grace Episcopal Church,
and in the evening he will deliver an ad
dress at the Church of the Good Samari
tan, corner of Second and Folsom streets.
How loner the distinguished prelate will
remain in San Francisco has not yet beea
determined.
San Francisco Girls' Union.

â¢â is elected to Congress he was a
: r and his principal market
by enterprise and intelligence j
profitable export trade with that
try. In his busy life and many contacts he had
- rowing danger to American labor here
â ? coolie competition. He believed that a
the fate white labor was impending, j
He was not only a witness to its growing distress,
but he felt the pinch that hurt the white laborer. In
Congress he took a strong position in favor of Chi
nese exclusion. He was a pioneer in the measures
of national legislation for the relief of the white labor
of California from Chinese competition. His learn
ing, industry and character lifted the issue into '
.iner.ee and he devoted them all to indoctrinating i
tern sentiment with a sense of the nerd* of white j
labor here. We all know now how necessary was j
such education in the East Looking back we are
amazed at the total indifference felt there upon that
subject.
When Mr. Davi= took that position and stood for
the : â  hite labor immediately his export trade
struck at destructively by China. While he
ingly for the rights of labor he saw his
with China disappear and suffered the loss of
it- profit with no expression of regret, for it was sac
-1 to what he considered to be his duty to his
fellow man. He had inherited no fortune. He had
to begin winning one on the level with the masses
remembered the tirst stages of his
er and he saw others starting as he had handi
ped and thrown by the competition of Chinese
>r, and he Ifastly, while his export busi
ebbed away to nothing.
All this means that Horace Davis, who is nightly
. by Mr. Phelan of having no sympathy for
le, did in their behalf make a sacrifice at
â  men would hesitate. To him Chinese
n was a principle which must not be weighed
money losses. So he lost the money, in
â¢ids. and cheerfully abided by principle.
Mr. Phelan is among the people calling
Horace Davis "a traitor" to their interests.

FILIPINO INDUSTRY.
GENERAL FUNSTON, in one of his recent
talks, is reported as saying: "A Filipino is
chronically tired. He is born tired; he stays
I and he dies tired. It you hire him he will labor
a few days, and then he goes out of the work business
for about a week, while he attends a fiesta or two. It
n't matter how much or how little you pay him;
ilipino will work just as hard for 50 cents a week
. lor 50 cents a day."
h: that statement General Funston has found the
crux of the whole question. In the characteristics he
the Filipino he describes all the tropical race*
races that have tried migration to the tropics.
Man. everywhere, is subordinate to his physical en
ent. He has energy and accumulates wealth
only in such environment as presents a natural re
sistance winch energy may overcome. Civilization
and its great institutions have followed the temperate
zone around the world. In that zone haÂ« always been
the wealth of the world. No tropical country was
ever wealthy. That part of the globe that lies under
m has always been poor. As we approach
the equator the energy of man declines, and the
bounty of nature increases to an extent that supplies
the physical wants with but little human exertion.
â¢ General Fdnston observed marks the difference
between tinental and insular expansion. No
who opposed or who favored the Louisiana
and Florida purchase, the admission of Texas and the
: what came to us after the Mexican war,
unds. All of it was territory lying
in the temperate zone, fit for occupancy by a homo
geneous people, and with a physiography that re
quired exertion to produce the necessaries of life and
sustain existence. As its physical character did not
widely vary, the system of government required for its
civic administration esi I equality before the
r a people who are . with another, in
Â»c environment. Eqt me to be the rule
ernment because of these physical conditions
and the likeness of the people to each other. When
to the tropical inlands all this is changed. The
that people them arc not suited to our racial in
â¢ ns. As physical conditions are unequal, the
laws regulating the rights of person and property.
and the statutes that re'este to the hours and conditions
of labor, and the wages fixed by the standards of
life, applicable here, are inapplicable in the tropics.
ral Fonston has aided in inflaming the Ameri
by an alluring picture of the wealth
to be : the natural resources of the Philip
. s will equal Java and Ceylon.
That r. â¢ But as the Filipinos, un
. vertical sun. are born tired and
ng lin their energies and labor
there, I extracted from the natural rc
-. will have to be won by forcing
r under natural conditions that make voluntary
â  me. If we are to get the
riches that are waiting in the swamps and forests we
â  â  as the British planters in Ceylon and the
Dutch in Java have done, by instituting what Pro-
I . 1 calls "a benevolent despotism," either
exercised over the tired natives or by the use of
â  â¢ tract labor from China.
It is not wise to tell the American people, as in
iral Department has in an ofn
: rep â â *. that "the Philippines open up alluring
prospects lor the American home-seeker." Xor is it
wise to make it appear that the indisposition of
the natives to work is eradicable by any change in
Iheir form of government or religion or their method
of education. In each case these anticipations will not
be fulfilled, therefore it is unwise to encourage them.
Just in proportion as they are unjustifiably encour
the reaction be severe.
There is no place for the American home-seeker in
the islands, not only because of their present dense
population but by reason of a poison climate in which
the white home-Â«eeker cannot live and work.
In this business, then, it is well to start with no
illu ns that when dispelled will cause an afflicting
reaction. Xo temperate zone nation has ever secured
any profitable commerce out of its tropical posses
sions except by forced or servile labor. From the
Philippines we must look to China for the coolie labor
which will enrich the few Americans who can go with
capital to add to their wealth by employing a form
of labor repugnant to all American ideas and cus
toms. This will be our method there, and there will
be as little thought about the elevation of that kibor,
its education and training for an advance in the
standards of life as there is in California on the same
lines in regard to the Chinese coolies here. Neither
the labor laws, customs nor wages in the Philippines

not participate in them, btit will plod along in the
place and way fixed by nature.

THE CARE OF FORESTS.
[NNESOTA, having given considerable at
/ \ tention to the condition of her forests and
1 * having employed an expert to devise a plan
for reforesting large areas of laud on which the tim
ber has been destroyed, will, it is said, apply to Con
gress this winter for assistance in the work. The Gov
ernment will be asked to establish a national park
to include upward of a million acres of land in the
Leach Lake Indian reservation and to maintain on it
a forest under scientific cultivation.
Whether the Government accede to the desire of
Minnesota or not. the debate on the measure a ill
have the effect of bringing to the attention of Con
gress the vast importance of our forests and the im
perative need of devising some means of protecting
them. It is not at all likely, however, that Congress
will undertake that supervision as a part of the work
of the National Government. The conflict of inter
cuts would l>c too confusing. It is as much as Con
gress can do to handle a river and harbor bill with an
approach to fairness and economy. If all the States
v,ere to enter into a new rivalry to obtain grants and
appropriations for forest reserves Senators and Rep
resentatives would hardly have time for anything
else than log-rolling and making deals for appropria
tions.
Moreover, Congressional action, even if in the end
it should be taken, will be long delayed. It there
lore behooves the States to enter upon the work of
forest protection for themselves. Thus far Minne
sota has done well. She has made liberal appropria
tions for the protection of her timber and has em
ployed men of scientific eminence and expert knowl
edge to investigate and determine what is best to be
done to save the remnants of those mighty forests of
pine which were once declared to be inexhaustible.
That which she asks of the National Government will
be no more than supplementary to that which she is

doing for herself, and her claim will therefore have
rr.ore weight than would attach to a similar claim
froni a community which, like California, has done
little or nothing to protect itself.
The plan proposed for the Minnesota park appears
perfecly feasible. It is designed to permit the cut
ting of timber within its limits, but under govern
mental restriction. Such a system might well be ap
plied by the nation and by the States to nearly all the
timber lands that remain. It is said France derives
a revenue of $2 62 annually for each acre of its state
forests; the little duchy of Baden has an annual
net income of $667,000 from its 240,000 acres of public
forest; the Black Forest in Wurtemburg is made to
yield $2 50 an acre; the forests of Sweden, Switzer
land and other countries will compare favorably with
these, and in every caÂ«e the forest is preserved as in
violable capital, planting following cutting, and only
those trees that are fit for the ax being taken.
The forest fires that have been raging in so many
parts of California until the rain checked them at
test the urgent need of prompt action in this State to
protect the woods. It will be gratifying of course to
have the National Government give aid in the work,
but we should not wait for that aid. California is one
of the States of the Union whose people are suffi
ciently rich and intelligent to help themselves.

PACIFIC COAST INTERESTS.
BY all odds the most important part of the work
undertaken by the recently organized Traffic
Association is that of urging the appointment
of n representative of the Pacific Coast to the Inter
state Commerce Commission. Such an appointment
vould be a recognition of the rights of this section
of the Union and would place in a position of power
ard authority a guardian of those rights whenever
threatened.
Events now occurring manifest clearly the need of
such a representative. For some time past the ag
gressive merchants and manufacturers of St. Louis
and Chicago have-been seeking to induce the Inter
state Commerce Commission to so change freight
rateÂ« as to give to those cities and others in the same
region of the country a considerable advantage over
the cities of the sea coasts on both the Atlantic aivj
the Pacific side of the country. If the scheme be
carried out the merchants and the manufacturers of
the Pacific Coast will be so heavily handicapped that
many of them will be virtually crowded out of busi
ness.
The merchants of this city have taken active and
well considered steps to avert the danger. Ry the
organization of the Traffic Association they have not
only acquired a greater force than they could have
exerted by acting separately, but they have been able
to rally to their aid in the contest the more enter
prising citizens of other Pacific Coast cities. It i*
now certain that when the issue is joined with St.
Louis and Chicago before the Commerce Commis
sion San Francisco will not have to make the fight
alone. The whole Pacific Coast for once will be
united for the maintenance of its rights.
While the immediate point at issue is that of set
tling freight rates, it will be readily perceived that
even a complete victory for us on that score would
be of but temporary value, since the question could
and would probably be reopened at the next meeting
of the commission. So long as we have not in that
body a representative of our interests, so long will
there be danger of the establishment of rates which
will work material harm to our merchants and our
industries. The main point, therefore, which is now
at stake is that of obtaining such representation, and
to that end all the commercial and political influences
of the coast should be directed.
In an emergency of this kind it would be folly to
introduce State prejudices or antagonisms. The ob
ject of the movement is not to advance the fortunes
of some candidate in this State or in Oregon or in
Washington, but to bring about the selection of a
strong, able, resolute, sagacious man to represent the
whole Pacific Coast on the commission and to guard
its interests in all controversies over the regulation
of rates.
The time, therefore, has come for the exercise of
a genuine Pacific Coast patriotism. If there be divi
sions among ourselves there will be but a forlorn
hone of winning, but if the representatives of all the
coast cities can unite in urging the selection of some
man who will represent the whole coast, the much
desired object may be attained. The issue is one
whose importance cannot be ignored, and it is grati
fying to note that at present all prospects point to
the conclusion that the merchants of the coast are in
thorough accord on the subject and are going to
work together in harmony to the end.
A VOICE FROM THE TRANSVAAL
ACCORDING to the Mosquito, a satirical
weekly published in the English language at j
Johannesburg, South Africa, the dissensions
and controversies which have led up to the war be
tween the Boers and the British were not caused by
the Boers or by the Uitlanders who went to the I
Transvaal to work, or by the mining magnates of the
Rand, Each of those parties, says the Mosquito, has i
good reasons for desiring peace. The disturbance !
has been started and fomented by another class of
men altogether.
In a leader headed "Plain Speaking" the Mosquito J
says: "In the words of Zola, 'J'accuse' the Kimberley j
diamond bosses who tired of wandering in the wil- !
derness of charterland are, under the leadership of
their Moses, the arch conspirator. Rhodes, endeavor- I
ing to seize this land of promise. 'The Jameson raid â 
failed; the Cape Premiership was lost; the spoils j
which they have cajoled from the British public have
been squandered; so as a dernier ressort these auda
cicus conspirators are endeavoring to use the great '
British nation as a catspaw to attain their ends. The I
latest war cry is the supremacy of the English race
over the Dutch in South Africa, which certainly
sounds harsh from a conglomerate people whose
racial mixture is its strongest point."
This view of the situation which preceded the war
is interesting mainly because of the source from
which it comes. It makes evident the fact that a
proportion of the English speaking Uitlanders at
Johannesburg sufficiently strong to support a first
class weekly journal regard Rhodes as the cause of
all their troubles, and do not look upon Kruger as an
oppressor. The Mosquito quotes with approval the
saying of another English newspaper of the city: "We
came here to work, not to agitate, and we have the
moral courage of our opinions." It is a pity the voice
of such men had no weight in England. Rhodes has
had his way.

court the other day in the rear room of a saloon is

EDITORIAL VARIATIONS.
BY JOHN McNfIUGHT.
By courtesy of the author, Orlando J.
Smith, there has come to me a little vol
ume bearing the title. '-'A Short View of
Great Questions." The questions are
those the human mind is forever asking
concerning the nature of the soul and lts_
relations to the universe. The short'
view Is that the soul Is as eter
nal as the universe Itself. It was
not created, as the theologians say, nor
evolved through ages of development, as
the scientists say, but was and is and
shall be because it is itself a part of the
universe, and not subject to either crea
tion or annihilation.
The hook Is a presentation of the philos
ophy which underlies the doctrine of the
transmigration of souls, and comes well
recommended. Colonel RohÂ»rt G. Ingersoll,
who saw the advance sheets of the work,
wrote to the author: "You have stated
your ideas with great force and clearness.
You have made the best presentation that
I have read." John Clark Rldpath wrote:
"I can but regard your book as a per
manent contribution to literature. Your
work Is more than an Interesting addi
tion to polite letters; it Is a profound
study upon what I can but regard as the
greatest of all questionsâ the question of
human destiny. You have added to the
world of thought and hope, and that Is
far greater than to add to the world of
passing emotion."
That much of commendation Is suf
ficient to show how Tar we have pro
gressed in our intellectual development.
It is not so very long ago since in an
effort to break the will of a rich man
the fact that he believed In the transmi
gration of souls was submitted as evl
j dence of unsound mind, and the court ad
: netted it. Xow the same doctrine is re
ceived with approval, and an argument
in its favor Is hailed as a permanent con
i tributlon to literature. Thus do we grow
j in variety if not in wisdom, and produ c
new philosophers as well as new million
aires.
â¢ â¢ â¢
The "short view" argument Is simple.
It begins by asserting as a self-evident
proposition that the supreme law of the
universe is Justiceâ "Justice to the finest
degree, as exact as arithmetic, as the
| movements of the star:-." It then pro-
Is: "There are but three theories of
: man's origin and destiny. First, tl c
1 theory of materialism, that man's life
I egins with his birth and ends with
the death of his body; second, the theory
I of theology, that man is created at his
birth with an immortal soul which survives
! the death of his body; third, the theory
of reincarnation, sometimes called metem
psychosis, or the transmigration of souls,
that man has an immortal soul which
existed before his birth and survives the
death Of his b0.1y."
After that much has been set forth as
: utable, the rest is easy. It is said:
If God or nature has created one man
good and another man bad, then God or
nature has been unjust. Justice <
I lished only upon one theoryâ that
â ,i of man is pre-exlstent and after
( sclstent, Immortal and eternal. Man will
forever be what he makes himself. His
B and his vices are his own: his
| strength and goodness are his own. "Era
phasis," says the writer, "should be
! upon the fact that the theory of
â¢.on Is nothing more nor less
, than the doctrine of the complete Immor
tality of the soul. It is no new doctrine,
iw thought, no aew revelation. It Is
but the completion of the old belief which
, all men have held in nearly all
times."
All of which Is most excellent, but I
I would like to see the argument or the
! array of facts on which is based the as
' sumption that the supreme law of the
universe is justice. So far as is known to
me (here is not one Binirie fi>rce In the
universe that tends to justice save only
â the desire of the human Intellect,
'that force i? so easily swayed to contrary
courses by every promise of personal gain

worthiest men. Neither do I see much of
justice In the doctrine of reincan
i Why should a man's soul be

* * *
Elaborating his theory of justice, the
â¢her of the creed of reincarnation
pays: "The law of averages Indicates that
what is called luck !s only manifest In a
superficial or a temporary sense, and that
in the deeper and iiKÂ«re permanent sense
there Is no such thing as hazard In the
world." He goes on in another place to
say: "Man Is his own savior. Heaven
and hell are real. Hell is in the neglect
ing of opportunities. Heaven is in the
j improving of opportunities."
Were there justice in the world that
might be true, but as there is no justice
It Isn't true. Luck is one of the most
I potent factors in human life. It deter
mines the outcome of almost every yen
! ture. Many a man has seized an oppor
i tunlty only to tind that he has caught a
! hornet. Many a man lias neglected op
portunitles, and by doing so has had a
â¢ opportunity later on. Opportunity
is like a pretty woman. It is sometimes
of advantage to embrace her and f^m'
times of advantage to forego the bliss,
I but as to when the one time and not the
, othT is present no mortal wisdom can
i determine.
Two prospectors go up a mountain path
and reach a place where it can be pur
! sued no further; a turn must be made
either to the right or the left. One man
goes to the right and after dangers and
toils met with courage and perseverance
i leaves his bones In some lonely canyon.
i The other turns to the left and finds a
bonanza. What is it but luck?
One man makes a friend and the friend
betrays him, another makes an enemy and
the enemy serves him; one man marries
I his first love and wishes aftt-rward he had
i gone to Texas first, and another goes to
Texas and behold he finds an angel; one
man sends wheat to a famine land and
it gets there just after the market has
! been overstocked, another sends coal to
Newcastle and it roaches port just as a
i miners' strike occurs and he makes a
I fortune and gets a reputation as a finan-
I cier. The proverb of the people says, -'it

In the good old days of South Africa,
before the diamond fields wore discovered'
two Englishmen, James Searight and John
Owen Smith, were engaged In partnership
in doing a general trading business
through the country. When they deter
mined to dissolve the partnership and re
tire from trade they found among their
assets a certain tract containing 10,000
acres of land, but situated so far away on
the desolate plateaus of the interior of
the country that It was hardly worth any
thing at all. It was Impossible to put a
value on it. Neither of them would agree
to accept it as any part of his share of the
partnership capital. So they divided it
and then each went his way and thought
no more of It.
In the fullness of time a native of the
wilds found a pretty pebble which he sold
for a trifle and the buyer, taking it to
C;ipe Town, sold it for a fortune, for It
was one of the rarest diamonds on earth
It started a stream of enterprising ad
venturers to the diamond fields and out of
the rush came the founding of a new city
Now it so happened that in all South Af
rica there was no place so fitted for the
metropolis of the diamond diggings as
that particular tract of land which the
British merchants accounted valueless. So
they became speedily rich, enormously
rich. That was luck. Then It chanced the
discovery of the gems occurred just be
fore the formal boundary line between the
British and the Boer possessions was sur
veyed, so the British turned the line aside
and took the rich district for themselves
Thus Klmberley Is British as a result of
luck, but now tha.t the Boers are advanc

If any particular incident of luck be sep-
arated from the rest of life and regarded
by Itself alone, it would indeed appear to ;
be superficial and temporary. It Is. only
when its effects and consequences are not
ed that its importance in life becomes evi
dent Nothing Is so stimulating to en- :.
ergy, so strengthening to confidence, as
good luck, nor anything more depressing
to the heart and the brain than bad luck. |
Moreover, the fortune which good luck
brings, though it be trifling In itself, opens
a door to another fortune.
The doctrine of reincarnation may be (
true, but it is not to be proven by argu- :
ments based upon the Justice of the nat- \
ural order of things. Unless there be an
almighty creator whose purposes em
brace all the accidents of life and who
in his own way and in his own time In
tends to make them serve the cause of |
justice, then there is not nor ever will be â 
any Justice.
Meantime it Is but fair to say that "A
Short View of Great Questions" is an in- j
teresting contribution toward the solution j
of a problem which will forever engage
the thoughts of all earnest men and wo
men, and while it gives no answer that j
will be acceptable to the general run of
civilized men, It deserves a creditable
place among those attempts which a Bos
ton wit once described as efforts to "scrut i
the inscrutable and poss the impossible." j
Senator Hanna's statement, "It Is an in
sult to Admiral Dewey to speak of him
as a candidate for the Presidency," is a
hard saying. The office of President of
the United States is a very high office
indeed, and to be chosen chief magistrate
of this great republic Is about as exalted
an honor as can be conferred on mortal

It is this fact that makes every biog

There are some problems of government
so profound and so complex, we can
never too much admire the wisdom of the
officials who solved them. The Arabs
have a proverb that whenever Allah calls
a man to an office he provides him with
the wisdom to fill It. That must be as
true in the I'nited States as in the des
erts of Arabia.
Here is an illustration: In the Eastern
papers appeared an advertisement to this
effect: "On April 12. 1906, we will place
on a large sheet one quart of wheat.
Three Plymouth Rock hens, which have
been kept from feed for six hours, will
then be permitted to eat therefrom for
ten minutes, when the remaining kernels
will be taken up, counted and the number
eaten by tin? hens ascertained. To the
subscriber who estimates nearest the
number of kernels eaten by the hens we
will give 150."
The postoffice authorities were called
upon to decide whether the advertised
scheme was or was not a lottery. The
official to whom the problem was referred
evidently derived his brains from Allah,
to whom praise be given, for he has add
ed to the records of our governmental
wisdom this decision: "The eating pro
pensities of hpns, even though they be of
the same breed, undoubtedly vary, and
the number of kernels eaten by one trio
would be no criterion as to the number
that would be taken up by another at
a different time, although under precisely
the same conditions. In my opinion, this
scheme Is a lottery and all matter relat
ing to It is unmailable."

CINCINNATI, Oct. 21.â Music Hall
could not contain all wanting to hear
Governor Roosevelt and Senator Foraker
at the mass-meeting hore to-night. Qov
ernor Roosevelt arrived in the morning
and was entertained at a series of din
ners by Judge Tart of the Piccadilly Club
and others. This evening he was escort
ed from the St. Nicholas Hotel to Music
Hall by one of the largeat processions
ever seen In this city, including a bat
talion of 100 Rough Riders, ail veterans
of the Spanish war. In addition to the
torches and blazing illuminations along
the Hue of march there was a great dis
play of fireworks. The hall was filled
before the parade reached it. Governor
Bushnell and staff wero in the city for
the annual police Inspection and drill, but
were not at Musio Hall.
County Chairman Kushman opened tho
meeting and presented Senator Foraker,
the presiding officer. Senator Foraker
made a stirring address of an hour in
support of Judge Nash for Governor and
the indorsement of President McKinley.
Governor Roosevelt spoke as follows:
A rrlrn'.y oomlc feature of the present inter
national conspiracy against America and civ
ilization Is the way in which the adherents of
AffuinaJdo in the Philippines and his apologists
hero pat "one another on the bade, and another
striking feature Is the wild invective, the say- :
age and Incoherent violence of thÂ» language ,
employed by these apostles of peace.
Yet, after all, it is but natural. They are re- ;
peating prfcisÂ»tely the tactics of tho Copper- j
heads of the Civil war. Those of you who are j
old enough will remember that the Copperheads I
who denounced the Union army always de- |
nounced them In the name of the new gospel j
of peace. Their cry was "Peace, ' even "Peace
at any price," and it was these apostles of .
peace, who by their furious denunciation of
Abraham Lincoln and of the Northern people i
and their frantic Invectives against every ,
measure of the Government finally stirred, to
madness the dark and gloomy souls that are
alwayg to be found on tne outskirts of such a .
movement. In 1M the preachers of the doc- \
trine of cowardly peace were responsible for
the terrible ar.d bloody outbreaks in - "â 'â¢ York
City, which we now know by the name of the
draft riots. In I;'js these same craven preach
ers of peace were responsible for the murder of ,
Abraham Lincoln. Nowadays their succes
sors, who use their exact language in denounc
ing our conduct in the Philippines, have stained
their own souls with the biood of our soldiers
and of their Philippine foes.
Tho other day Ohio sent to New York as a
preacher of the new dispensation Congressman
Lenti, a fit and worthy successor of Vallandlg
ham. iv his speech in -New York Mr. Lenta
divided his time between eulogizing Angela,
the mar. who pardoned the anarchist bomb i
throwers; and eulogising Agulnalao, whose sue- ,
cess would mean and could only mean the j
slaughter of the American soldiers and the ,
dishonor of the 'American flag. He likened
Aeuinaldo to Patrick Henry, and called him ;
one of the heroes of the world, and he de- j
nounced the war which we are carrying on for | ]
the suppression of savages- as more brutal and | â¢
cowardly than â  at carried on by lÂ»eorÂ« 111 â  â 
againat "us. Ho took the position that Aguln- ,
aldo was a hero for killing our Eoldlers, but i
that If they slew him it would be murder. ,
While Mr. Lentz was thus preaching treason ,
\guinuldo was sending over a message, which
"has only the other day been published. He j
had evidently not heard of Mr. Lents, but be
had heard of some of the minor heroes of the ( (
anti-expansion (that is, anti-American and â  ;
anti-patriotic) movement, and he praised them
in terms which, if the men were capable of j â 
one thrill of American feeling, would make I
them shudder with horror of having won and ,
deserved such commendation from an enemy
of their country. Finally, with a simple Pin
cerity which Agulnaldo's party allies here would
do well to imitate the proclamation of the ;
Philippine chief continues in so many words
to state that his hope of successful resistance ,
to the authority of the United States is based
on the triumph of the Democratic party. Con
tinuing, he says: , . , i
"Therefore we must show our gratitude and i
maintain our position more resolutely than
ever We should pray to God that the great
Democratic party may win the next â¢Presiden
tial election and imperialism (that Is, the
American people) fall in its mad attempt to
Eubjugate us by force of arms."
In other words. Agulnaldo is fighting for the
Democratic party and the Democratic party
for m: the arms of his men who snoot down
our soldiers are nerved by the aid and encour
agement given them by the anti-expansionists
ol the United States, and he continues the
bloody war In the Philippines because he hopes
ultimately to win through their assistance. No
more burning indictment of the Democratic
party under Its present leadership and of the
preachers of treason who have taken the lead
In denouncing the course of the United States
could be framed by any American. Bear in
mind that this arraignment of the Democracy Is
unconsciously given by their friend Aguina do
thÂ» man who at present stands a, the typical
representative of savagery, the typical foe of â 
civilization and of the American people and
M the peculiar protege of the men who m the
United States In 1899 are repeating the arfru
ments of those who in IS6I and 1885 sought to
b K?erv S argument that can be made for the
Philippines could be made for the Apaches;
every word that can be said for AeulnaMo
couid be said for Sitting Bull As peace and
order and prosperity followed our expansion
war on the lands of the Indians so they will
follow us in the Philippines. If we hnd refused
to expand over the West, do you think that the
We Et would be peaceful now? If. Instead of
your forefathers settling here in Ohio you had |
left Ohio to the Indians, do you think the coun
try would have had pence? Indeed it would
not Just bo long as there was an Independent
Indian power on your borders you were ex
posed to the certainty of constantly recurring I
war If now the United States were to walk<
out of Alaska or out of any of our Indian reseN
rations, as our opponents wish us to walk out
of the Philippines, war would promptly ensueâ
war among the natives themselves or between
the natives and the white intruders; and if
we do not again step in and settle the matter,
why some other great nation would have to
undertake the work which we had proved our
selves too feeble or too foolish to perform.
I Last summer the United States had the
honor to take what was, on the whole, the lead
ing part in the Peace Conference at The Hague.
We were ablÂ» to play that part solely because
durin?" the preceding year we had fought to a
victorious conclusion the most righteous foreign
war in which any nation has been engaged for
half a century, Our power to furtner the
cause of | â¢ ace as among' the civilized nations
of the world has been immeasurably increased
becaui-e we have shown ourselves able and will-
Ing to do our part In policing the world, In
keeping order In the world's waste span-*. ,

inK preaches peace but little good results, but.
as was shown at The Hague last year, wnen a

immediately manifest. When throughout the

the fncts. our opponents have spoked as thouKli
this was unnecessary, as if it were now waged
fv iÂ»"oÂ«ident McKlnlÂ«y on bis own authority
and without the warrant of Congress. In the
OrVt nice, what we have donÂ« waa inevitable,
so" far as the administration and the American
r,VnÂ£ at lflrci* were concerned. There was
lust one chance of avoiding war. If the antl
iioanslonisti the p"".c<-at-any-price people
had not delayed the treaty in the Senate; if
v their loose invective they had not misled
the Tairals we should probably net have had
niiv war in'the Philippines. Asuinaldo's procla
mation proves beyond shadow of doubt that
the Insurgents have held CUI on the strength
of the hoped-for aid from the Democratic party
and from thÂ» anti-expansionists here in our
home Had those men not given the Impression ;
thrt 'the American people were divided; had |
they not worked for delay, there would proh
ablv have been no revolt and no bloodshed By
their clamor and by their obstructive tactics in :
the Senate they net only delayed the acceptance
of the treaty but Gave Agulnaldo and his people |
the Idea that they would receive moral support J
In a war against our flag; and. moreover, they
have actually given this support. They nre
primarily responsible for the war. We are the
true party of peace, for a lasting peace can
only come through the course of conduct we ,
advocate.
Remember that expansion 1b not only the
handmaid of greatness, but. above nil. It Is i
the handmaid of peace. Great civilized powers j

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, OCTOBER 22, 1899.
able to live in permanent peace with onÂ« an
other; but no civilized power is or ever haÂ§
been able permanently to keep peace with
savage, barbarous or semi-barbarous peoples,
because these latter are not able to so oon
duct themselves as to render peace possible.
The day when universal peace Is possible
can only come when the nations of the world
have grown civilized. In snme places this
state o* things can come about merely by
growth of civilisation In the state itself; else
where It has to come about by the expansion
of the great, orderly, peace-loving powers.
We of the United States are not In the slight
est danger of any trouble with the Canadians
of the north, nor with the Mexicans on the
south; It Is not conceivable that a difficulty
should arise with either that could not bÂ«
settled by peaceable methods. So In the Pa
ciflc, I most firmly believe that we ehall be
able to work hand In hand with England,
with Germany, with Japan, with every civil
! ized power that has Interests In that great
est of all oceans. With every orderly, peace
\ loving-, civilized country, great or small, we
Can work with perfect harmony. But with
savagery there can be no peace until we have
first made evident our strength.
The whole history of our century shows a
diminishing tendency to war between oivilized
powers, and shows also that the existence of
, a savage or barbarous state Inevitably means
! war sooner or later. Every expansion of a
civilized power Is a conquest for peace. Re
member that even this great country of ouru,
as well as all European countries, paid tribute
t" the Moorish pirates as late as 1830, and
piracy In its most abhorrent form was not
! abolished In the Mediterranean until the
I French expanded Into Algiers and the Turk
I was driven from Greece. Then peace came to
the Mediterranean. What the French have
I done in Algiers, the English have done in
i Egypt and the Soudan. While Egypt was un
' der Arabi Pasha and the Soudan under the
Mahdi, the two countries were sinking stead
ily back Into mere savagery: until they were
held by a strong and civilized race no ad
i vcnce was possible. Now peace and prosperity
i have come to both countries. Turkistan was
a mere chaos of murder and lawlessness until
] the wave of Russian expansion swept over the
j country, to the great good of mankind ar.d
â  brought peace In its train. Now Germany
, has the Carolines, and under her adminlstra
; tlon they will doubtless flourish In peace.
WTiat she has undertaken to do in the Caro
| lines, are we to shrink from doing In the
â  Philippines? Are we alono among the great
nations of the world to announce ourselves
' too weak to do our share of the task, too
â  timid to bear our part of the burden In ex
tending the reign of law, of order of peace,
i over the whole world? That Is what expan-
I slon means. It means not only the extension
I of American influence and power. It means the
extension of liberty and order and the bring
ing nearer by gigantic strides of the day when
peace shall come to the whole earth.
In view of this attitude of certain of our
! r r -'~Ple, the struggle was inevitable. When
l'owey smashed the Spanish fleet, it meant
I that the Islands would fall into chaos unless
! either the United States or some other strong
' power took possession; unless we were will
i ing to see the fleet of another power sail into
i the harbor as Dewcy's fleet sailed.
The treaty with Spain was finally ratified
I by the Senate, but it was not ratified by the
1 Spanish Government until a fortnight after
! Congress had adjourned, leaving the President
to act aa the nation's representative. The
lower House had, meanwhile, taken Its share
: in the ratification (the opposition was so small
; as to be Insignificant) by passing the appro
i prlntlon of $20,000,000, uk required by the treaty.
| The Islands thus, by the ratification of the
i treaty and by the action of thÂ« Senate and
j by the House of Representatives In passing
! the $20,000,000 appropriation bill, became part
! of the United Stntes; and it is Just as much
1 the President's duty to keep order in them
; by the use of the army, as it would be his
! duty to kepp order In Arizona by the use
I of the army in case of an Apache- outbreak.
Nor Is thiF all. In passlnc the army bill,
Congress explicitly recognized the fact that
there was a Philippine insurrection and that
it had to be put down by the use of our arm->d
forces. It provided for an army of over 60.000
regular and over 30,000 volunteers, especially
with a view of meeting the present exigencies;
it Is set forth that the army should be kept
up to these figures for two years. In other
words. Congress explicitly provided an army
of nearly 100,000 men for the purpose of carry
ins out the Philippine war. Under such cir
cumstances the talk of this war being un
authorized by Congress can be due only to
Ignorance or willful intention to suppress the
facts.
The taking of the Philippines was Inevitable.
The outbreak was rendered Inevitable by the
conduct of those who opposed the taklnu of
the Philippines and who gave moral aid and
comfort to Aguinaldo and his men. The Presi
dent has acted In the only way In which he
could act and remain loyal to his oath of of
fice and to the great trust delivered by thÂ«
people Into his hand?. We are doing but our
pimple duty in introducing the reign of law.
order an 1 peace Into the Philippines, and we
cannot shrink form It without shame and dis
honor. The path of expansion is a path of
rational honor, the path toward universal
peace. Tou, my countrymen, cannot refuse to
tread It unless you are willing to renounce
your claims to bo the heirs of the ages and to
abandon all pretense of following In the foot
steps of Washington, of Lincoln and of all tho
great Americana who have made our past his
tory mighty and glorious.

l fair, was a clever and spirited exhibjtion.
i and Us arrangement was due to a large
: number of racehorse men and followers
! being stormbound here after the annual
'â¢ race meet, who raised the purse of $bOO.
: The contest was billed as a fight to a fin
ish, and scats were sold for from $5 to 50
i cents each. The casualty, which looks
â  dubions for Hill's recovery, occurred in
1 the latter half of the sixth round. Hill,
althoush th- smaller man, showed up to
better advantage over his sturdy opponent
an,l punished Coxey unmercifully in each
round, and odds of 10 to 1 on Hill wont
, begging, and just before the knockout
blow was administered 20 to 1 found no
takers. The knockout blow la regarded
as purely accidental.
The doctor to-night pronounces Hills
'â  condition critical. Hill is a well-known
race follower. Coxey claims relationship
with "General" Coxey of the Coxey army
fame The authorities have detained
Coxey and the light promoters pending
the result of Hill's condition.

NEW HAVEN, Conn., Oct. 21.â Tho TJnl
! versity of Wisconsin football elerven had
their colors lowered by Yale hÂ«re this aft
ernoon in a contest, the final score of
which was Yale 6, Wisconsin 0, but the
I Yale men required nearly all of the- fifty
| minutes' play to secure the single touch
i down and goal which constituted her vlc
| tory over the young men who came from
the West to wage the battle. The gama
in many respects was the finest ever wlt
i nessed on the Yale gridlorn, for it was
! not until within the last five minutes of
the play that the Yale men wero able to
I cross the coveted goal lino. At that tho
play was of an extraordinary character,
and* the scoring came only after a thiill
ing run of sixty-five yards by Richards,
the Yale halfback, who was carried by
magnificent interference- past the Wis
consin's rush line, and then, being left to
his own resources, wiggled his way
through the entire Wisconsin back field,
eluding the four crack backs of the Bad
gers and ultimately planting the bail
squarely behind the goal posts.
Two twenty-five-minute halves were
played, and throughout the two periods
the Wisconsin men carried consternation
to the hearts of the Yale rooters by sam
ples of football which seemed to be in
! vincible. When nearly every spectator
I had concluded that the game would end
I In a tie at 0 to 0, Richards, a Yale half
back, who replaced Chadwlck In the sec
ond halt", was given the pigskin. He re
ceived it on Yale's forty-five-yard line and
In a trice pocketed himself In a bunch of
clever interference, which protected him
to the rush line.
Here matters became exciting and he
| broke away from his interference and
â  darted out into the open with the four
! Wisconsin backs converging upon him.
j The first one he dodged, the second he
i eluded with a clever foot movement, the
i third he bowled over with his free arm
and then proceeded to run around and
away from the last opponent, who went
tearing after him as the fleet runner sped
toward the line. He touched down and a
goal was kicked, rendering a score of 6.
The most striking feature of Wiscon
sin's play was found In the sole depend
ence of the Westerners upon Captain
O'Dea'a kicking ability. Not more than
a half-dozen times during the game did
the visitors undertake to advance the ball
by rushes, it being almost the invariable,
rule to send it back to ODea for a boot
i ing. This marvelous man displayed a
) kicking prowess which has nevÂ»r been
equaled on the Yale field, and the honors
were ail his way in this department of
the game. He was placet! at a disadvan
tage in the matter of drop kicking, for his
team seemed unable to get within strik
! ing distnnce. However, he made four at
tempts at goals from the field and all
were failures. Two of them were out-and
out misses, and twice his kicks were nice
i ly blocked by Yale men.
CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Oct. 21â Harvard,
j in defeating Frown TTniversfty eleven in
j to-duy's game ran up against its hard
â  est proposition thus tar, and it is to
Brown's credit that the crimson had to
i play a stiff game. Harvard's offensive
| and" defensive work were magnificent, but
i the team went against opponents who re
! sorted to combinations of trick plays and
i Quick runs around the ends.

THREE PARKS
ATTRACT THE
LEASHMEN
San Mateo Coursing Associa
tion Enters the Field â Jn
gleside and Union Park.
The gates of the Ban Mateo Coursing
Park .Association wore thrown open yes
terday to the public for the first time.
The attendance, made up almost entirely
of coursing enthusiasts, was good and the
sport exciting. The downpour of rain on
the previous day left portions of the
field heavy, thus equalizing the chances
of the dogs. Those with great speed were
apparently handicapped, for where they
should have led to the hare- by ten
lengths they were fortunate If they could
place two lengths of daylight between
themselves and their opponents.
The size of the ik-id Is deceptive. While
it appears small and criunpod, the num
ber of unusually long courses Indicates
plenty ol room with dogs and hares in
their "present condition. The hares are not
familiar with the escapes and ran a num
ber ot the dogs marly to death. Out of
the tlrst eight courses live consumed the
following amount of time: 3 minutes, 4:10,
5i;15, o:lu and 2AO respectively. St. Michael
beat For IVrsecution, both .jogs being: run
to an absolute standstill. Cash beat J. P.
Thrift's great uogr Brutus, the latter
finally stopping. Whitehead beat Young
America, the latter suffering from an af-
Xeeiion of the throat, which prevented him
from running- up to form. "Wild Tralee
und Beacon each had a "bye" and were
run together. Wild Tralee was beaten,
but it being a "bye" course la still in the
take*
The sport w<?nt smoothly â when It is
considered that all the held oincials as
sumed their duties without having had
recent practice at the gaane. The "slip
ping" ot Arthur Massey was excellent. C.
j. Jerome acted as judge, and in only one
course was his decision questioned by the
spectators. This was the course between
Hawker and Royal lush. Hawker led up
by f<.ur lengths, and, it is claimed, out
work Royal Flush during the greater
yÂ«art of the course, which lasted two min
utes and fifteen seconds. The decision
T.ent to Flush. Prince Hal ran a "bye"
course v.ith Sometime and by mistake
v.-ore the wrong colored collar. The judge
intended to sitrnal Prince Hal's victory,
but the flag went up for the other doer.
Jjt-ttors asked for on explanation and the
error was corrected before any harm was
dono.
The fog rolled in during the afternoon
find obscured sonr? of the sport, the dogs
Retting out of sight quickly. The run
down yesterday left the best dogs in
truining at the present time still in the
Etake. These will fight for the purses to
day. In addition sixteen of the dogs
beaten in tha first round will compete in
a consolation stake. A draw was held
for this last night and resulted as follows:
Royal Fan vs. I^idr Blanche; Benorlta vb
Gypsy; Beau l' r -\ vs. Sweet Emma; Lily of

STANFORD AND OLYMPICS PLAY A TIE GAME
ON A GRIDIRON KNEE DEEP IN PASTY MUD
Olympics 0, Stanford 0.
mUD, swamps, sloughs, bogs,
marshes and fens, with twen
ty-two canvas-.iacketed and
leather-helmeted football men
fn a slimy potpourri, was the football
garrm yesterday afternoon between
Stanford and the Olympics. Neither
side scored, but nobody seemed to care.
The amusement came from tho weath
er and the muddy Held, and football
was lost sight of In the comedy of
mucilaginous grime and mud-coated
athletes.
Before the game was called the field
was very heavy going, splotches of
rain puddles setting off the thick and
oozing gridiron. On the east side of
the Held was a miniature lake, but It
was unused, either for play or bathing
purposes. Hardly had the whistle that
starts the ball a-rolllng been heard
when tlie heavens loosened their
watery freight, and a none too gentle
rain began falling on players and spec
a.ike. First umbrellas were
sought, but the cloud shafts were too
tierce, and the crowd sought the pro
many escaping, -while tho relief dog was
released a number of times.
The puppies proved an exceptionally
good collection and showed line sport in
the majority of their courses. In the open
stake the most notable upset was the de
feat of Mountain Beauty by Nellie Bawn.
The Beauty was a 5 to 1 favorite. Merced
put out Forgive, which was favorite at
S% to 1.
The field was In excellent condition, of- j
fering a firm footing for the dogs and {
hares. There were a number of sharp \
Fhowers during the afternoon, but the i
coursing went on without Interruption. !
The attendance -was noticeably affected
by the oDenlng at the San Mateo Park.

tectlon of the nma.ll covered stand Rt
the south end of the field. Some there
were, the real enthusiasts, who
ecorned the rain and sat the game out
on the uncovered stands, their only
protection being an umbrella and a
coat.
As poon as the pame began the play
ers lost their Identity, As the song
goes, they all looked alike, and much
mud-scraping, face-waahing and dredg
ir.p were necessary to save personali
ties. Every time the opposing teams
came together there was a pwish, a
spurt and an eruption of mud. The
heaviest work of the day was after
the game, when the twenty-two ath
: â¢ weated In ablutionary labors.
Cadwallader, with an immaculate
suit and face, started the same with a
kick-off to Murphy. The ball dropped
in the Stanford back's hands twenty
five yards from the goal line, and
Sheehy dropped on Murphy. A:";< r a
few wallowing rushes Dinsmore was
forced to kick, and then the crowd

they wfre stopped, and the pigskin
changed Bides. But little ground was
gained by Stanford, and Murphy was
forced to punt. Dinsmore, the pritty
and Fiire-playlng half of the Olympics,
caught the ball and was downed in the
bog. TÂ»-n yards for ofl" side gave the
clubmen some ground, but they could
not advance It by "rushing, and the
punt was resorted to again. Stanford
kept gaining by those punts, and the
ball was dangerously n^.ir tho Olympic
goal, but In the hands of the clubmen.
Five yards from their own goal the
Olympics began to separate th< msrlves
from danger, until they reached the
fifteen-yard line, when the cardinal
dropped in tho mud three times and
the Olympics made no gain. Tho joy
on the Stanford face broke through
the cakes of mud, which fell to earth
as an accompaniment of "rah-rahs."
Just then the referee blew the whistle
and tho first half was over, Stanford
fifteen yards from a touchdown and
the ball In its possession.
The steaming athletes uncaked the
mud and restored their separate Identi
ties while waiting for tho. second half,

line stiffened and the mud froze. The

the ball passed to the college men.
Murphy punted to the twenty-yard

catch gave the ball to the cardinal

Murphy tried a drop kick for a goal,

BERKELEY VICTORIOUS.
League of the Cross Team Puts
Up a Good Football
Game.'
BERKELEY, October 21.â Rain and mud ;
made football a very slow affair upon the j
campus of the University of California j
this afternoon. It was a match game be
tween the League of the Cross Cadets and
Berkeley's varsity team. From the start
it was clear that the league men could
make but very little headway against the '
better trained veterans of the U. C. team,
but they showed commendable pluck from
start to finish. Time and time again the
varsity half backs went breaking tnrough
the line for ten and fifteen yards, but the
cadets rallied with spirit and faced their
opponents, only to have the onslaught re- I
peated.
Berkeley had the kiok-off and pent the I
ball well into the league's territory. The i
cadets got the ball, but failed to make the j
five yards. By continual bucking the var- i
sity forced their way down the field and
scored a touchdown in about ten minutes.
Kaarsberg kicked the goal. Berkeley got
the ball after it was in play again and
once more worked down the field for an
other touchdown. This time Kaarsberg
missod the goal and the scoro stood 11â0.
For the second half the Berkeley fresh- !
men changed places with the varsity, and '
Sasi
fenslve forces and worked down the
field yard by yard. It looked as if they
were going to score, but only for a
short time. Ten yards from the line
Stanford held the clubmen, and victory
was shut out from the Olympics, A
punt by Murphy for thirty yards
placed the pigskin out of danger.
Once more the Olympics tried to turn
the trick, and again they failed. This
time they worked their way to the
Stanford eight-yard line, and were
held when the double whistle ended
the game.

For Cure of Piles and Rectal Diseases
No Longer Necessary.
It has long been thought, not only by
some physicians but by people in general,
that the common, painful and exceeding
annoying trouble, piles, was Poetically in-
curable by any other means than a sur-
gical operation, and this belief has been
fhe cause of years of nee d less stiff er ing
because of the natural dread of surgical
operations. many salves, ointments and
There are many salves, ointments and
similar remedies on the market which
afford some relief in cases of piles, but
the Pyramid Pile Cure is the only prepa-
ration so far introduced that can be re-
liably depended upon to cure to stay
cured every form of itching, bleeding or
protruding piles. 'â ".'â¢ â "â '--- 'â  - , ,
Mrs. M. C. Hinkley of 601 Mississippi
street, Indianapolis, was told by her
physician that nothing but a surgical
operation, costing between seven and
eight hundred dollars, could cure her. as
she had suffered for fifteen years, yet
even in such a case as hers the Pyramid
Pile Cure accomplished a complete cure.
She says: "I knew an operation would
be death to me and tried the Pyramid
with very little hope, and it is not to be
wondered at that I am so enthusiastic in
its praise.' l
Major Dean of Columbus, Ohio, says ho
suffered for forty years from piles and
twenty years from itching piles, and in
his case two packages of the Pyramid
cured him. Â, ,
Mr. D. K. Reed of South Lyons, Mich.,
says: I would not take $500 and be placed
back where I was before I used the
Pyramid Pile Cure. I suffered for years
and it is now eighteen months since I
used it and not the slightest trace of tha
trouble has returned.
The Pyramid Pile Cure is sold by nearly
all druggists at 50 cents and $1 per pack-
age, and as it contains no opium, cocaine
or other poisonous drug it can be used
with perfect safety.
No one need suffer from piles in any
form who will give this excellent remedy
a trial. Made by the Pyramid Drug Co.,

Stuart's Dyspepsia Tab-
lets in All Stomach
Troubles.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are a dis-
covery of great value to the medical pro-
fession and the public. They are an un-
failing specific in all cases of dyspepsia
and disordered digestion.
Almost everybody's digestion is disord-
ered more or less, and the. commonest
thing they do for It is to take some one
| of the many so-called blood pu:
which in many cases are merely strong
cathartics. Such things are not needed.
If the organs are in a clogged condition.
they need only a little help and they will
right themselves. Cathartics irritate the
â¢ive linings of the 6tomach and
bowels and often do more harm than
good.
Purging is not what Is needed. The
thing to do is to put the food in condi-
tion to be readily digested and assimilat-
ed. Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets do this
perfectly. They partly digest what is
eaten and give the stomach just the. help
it needs. They stimulate the secretion
and excretion of the digestive fluids and
relieve the congested condition of the
glands and membranes. They put the
whole digestive system in condition to
do its work. When that is done, you
need take no more tablets, unless you
eat what does not agree with you. Then
take one, or two tabletsâ give them need-
ed kelp, and you will have no troi
It's a common sense medicine and a
common sense treatment and it will cure
every time. Not only cure the disease,
but cure the cause. Goes about it In a
perfectly sensible and scientific way.
We have testimonials enough to fill a
book, but we don't publish many of them.
Howeverâ
Mrs. E. M. Faith of Byrds Creek. Wis..
says: 1 have taken all the Tablets I got
of you and they have done their work
well in my case, for I feel lik" a different
person altogether. I don't doubt if I had
not got them I should have been at rest
by this time.
H. E. Willard. Onflow. la., says: Mr.
White of Canton was telling me of your
Dyspepsia Tablets curing him of dj
Bia. from which he had suffered for eigjit
years. As I am a sufferer myself! I wish
you to send me a package by return mail.
Phil. Brooks. Detroit, Mich says:
Your dyspepsia cure has worked wond-
ers in my case. I suffered for years from
dyspepsia, but am now entirely cured and
life as I never have before. I
gladly recommend them.
It will cost 50c to find out Just how
much Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets will
helj you. Try themâ that's the best way
to decide.
All drug-gists sell them. A little book
on Btomacn diseases will be mailed free
by addressing F. A. Stuart Co., Marshall,

The recently mustered out officers ana
men oi the First California Regiment are
considering the order from superior head
quarters to return into the guard on or
â¢ the 30th of next month and there
is considerable speculation as to the num
ber thai will avail themselves of the act
of March 21. which gives them the right
to re-enter the guard without loss of time
as to continuous service In the guard.
Rules and regulations submitted by
Colonel John P. Burgin, inspector general
of rifle practice for skirmish firing, have
been approved at superior headquarters
and lssu< d in orders.
The trophy, a silk flag, awarded In 1Â«97
mpany M, Seventh Regiment, will
again be competed for. The rules provide
that at least SO per cent of the members of
each company of Infantry should, on the
Completion of the course of practice at
rectangular targets, be exercised In skir
mish iiring.
The calculation of percentage will be
based as follows, viz.;
(a; At least 8u per cent of the total num
ber of this company should be present
and participate.
(b) If over SO per cent, percentage Is
based on men actually present, or num
ber of points made divided by highest
number of points possible to be made
with the number of men shooting.
(c) If under 80 per cent, percentage is
based as if 80 per cent of company were
present, or number of points made divid
ed by highest number of points possible
to make with ?0 per cent of the company.
The company making the highest per
centage shall be entitled to the trophy,
to be held until after the contest for the
next year, when it will be delivered to
the winning company for that year. The
trophy to become the property of the
company "winning it three years in suc
cession.
In case of a tie between two or more
companies the same will be shot off at
a time and under such conditions as may
be directed by the inspector general of
rifle practice.
Army Nurse Talks.
An attractive feature of the California
Regiment's band concert at the Alham
bra last night was the lecture delivered
by H. Waage, the Red Cross nurse. â¢â¢'
Mr. Waage entertained the house with
his campaign- experiences, humorous and
pathetic, and when he finished was called
back flye 'times to bow his acknowledg
ments. The soprano solos of Mrs. Eva
Tenny and the military busrle calls of
Trumpeter Henry Anderson filled an at
tractive programme of well-chosen num
bers. To-night the band will give its last
performance in this city, after which it
will play a. short road season through
the State. ;/.','â¢
A Campflre.
Lincoln Relief Corps No. 3, auxiliary to
the Grand Army of the Republic, will

B'nal B'rith Hall next Wednesday nl^ht.
Among the features will be O'Connor and

pointed George Banks as customs inspec

name was taken from the eligible list, and
he is one of the additional inspectors al
lowed upon the recommendation of Spe

TWO VOLUNTEER
REGIMENTS TO
GO THIS WEEK
Orders for Departure
Are Issued.
A new batch of orders was issued
yesterday in regard to the departure of
the two new volunteer regiments, the
Thirty-flrst and the Twenty-eighth, and
the order of sailing of the transports now
in port. There has also been a reassign
ment of the 350 recruits who have been
ordered to report to General Otis at Man
ila. According to the present arangement
the Manuense will sail to-morrow with
three companies of the, Thirty-first Vol
unteer Infantry, commanded by one field
officer, and 175 recruits, commanded by
Captain W. N. Hughes, Thirteenth Infan
try. The Pennsylvania will also sail to
morrow with 175 recruits, under the com
mand of Captain Edward T. Winston,
Nineteenth Infantry, and such other
troops as may be assigned to lt_ Although
it has not been so announced, the under
standing is that the Pennsylvania will go
from here to Portland and there embark
a portion of the Thirty-ninth Volunteer
Infantry. The remainder of that regi
ment and a portion of the Forty-fifth
Volunteer Infantry will sail from Port
land on the transport Olympia.
The transport Newport will sail abont
Tuesday or Wednesday, probably with a
portion of the Twenty-eighth Volunteer
Infantry, the remainder of the companies
composing that regiment sailing on the
Tartar a day or two later.
Nine companies of the Thirty-flrst Vol
unteer Infantry have received orders to
sail on the transport i.'ity of Peking,
which will get away about the middle of
the week.
Captain D. Niskern will go out on the
Newport as quartermaster, and First
Lieutenant H. L. Laubach will be on the
Pennsylvania in a similar capacity.
Captain James B. Hughes, Fourth Cav
alry, will go to Manila in charge of a
cargo of mules and horses. He will sail
from this port on the Centennial about
the middle of the week, and from there
jvill transship on another transport, not
yet designated, for Manila.
The animal transports Conemaugh and
Leenanaw will sail for the Philippines
some time next week with 600 mules.
A detachment, to consist of First Class
Sergeant Charles B. Meyers, Sergeant
Fred C. Flagg and Second Class Privates
Leo Browne, W. S. Chancey, A. W.
Crawford, H. J. Dornbusch, T. J. Pat
terson, w. T. Peyton and J. C. White of
the signal corps, now at Angel Island,
will sail on the Newport.
The departure of the Twenty-eighth
and Thirty-first regiments this week will
be closely followed by the mustering out
nt the Washington and Kansas volun
teers, the latter receiving their dis
charges on October 2S and the former on
November 1. By that time also additional
regiments of volunteers will begin to ar
rive from thr> recruiting camps in the
Bast, gome oil them being already on the
road, so that the tented cities on the
military reservation will at no time be
entirely deserted. The lowa and Ten
nessee regiments are also due to arrive
in the course of a week or ten days.
The trouble in the camp of the Wash
ington volunteers over the question of
transportation home has by no means
be*Mi settled, although, according to the
men, there is hut one way in which it can
be settled. They declare that they have
bad enough of transports and that they
propose to return to their homes by train.
Whether they go in a body as the guests
of the citizens of Seattle or as individ
uals. The citizens' committee, it Is un
derstood, are anxious for the boys to re
turn by transport In order that they may
be welcomed with a grand naval demon
stration on the Sound, as the Callfornians
were welcomed when they arrived in the
harbor of San Francisco. In view of the
stand taken by the soldiers, however, this
plan is hardly likely to be carried out.
The opposition of the volunteers was
briefly set forth by one of their number
lay as follows:
"( >nt of the entire regiment there are
at least "00 who arc going back to Wash
ington, find we are willing to go in a
body tn Seattle and parade because we
appreciate all that the people of that
tflty have done for us; but we do not
want to go on a transport, and we don't
intend to, even If we have to pay our
own fares by rail. Seven hundred men
cannot be given good accommodation*,
much less first class passage, on a trans
port. We have had a little experience In
that line, and now that we have got
cleaned up and straightened out after our
voyage from Manila we do not want any
more of it." ,
Colonel Evatt and Adjutant Long of the
Leicestershire Regiment, which cable re
ports name as having won distinction in
the victory over the Boers at Glencoe,
South Africa. Friday, are well known to
the officers and men of the California
Ropinient, to whom they showed many
attentions whom the latter were passing
through ITongkong en route to the Phil
ippines over a year ago. The two Brit
ish officers were afterward sent to Man
ila as military attaches and while there
were entertained In turn by the Callfor
nlans. Both Colonel Evatt and Captain
Long became very popular with the
Americans, to whom their good fortune
In battle will be welcome news.

HONGKONG MARU
IN HARBOR FROM
ORIENTAL PORTS
Mishaps on the Gipsy
and Townsend.
BOAT CAPSIZED IN THE BAY
SIX OF THE TRANSPORTS MAY
GET AWAY TO-MORROW.
The Toyo KisenKaisha's steamer Hong
kong Maru arrived from Hongkong, via
Yokohama and Honolulu, yesterday. She
was detained some time at the quarantine
station landing the Chinese passengers,
j and did not reach the Mall dock until
after 2 p. m. Her cabin passengers were:
C. P. Plunkett, B. Braham, W. Liebes,
Miss Marjorle Venton, A. Harrison, C. D.
j Lovejoy, Dr. A. Hartog, A. M. Hecks, J.
I B. Tenney, Mrs. E. T. Skidmore, Miss L.
I C. Kennan and L. Merle and wife.
As soon as the vessel docked Detective
Seymour went aboard and placed Miss
Marjorie Venton under arrest. She was
taken off the steamer at once and hurried
to the Central Police Station, much to the
I amazement of her fellow-passengers. Miss
I Venton is charged with being the accom
plice of Alba A. Kent, who swindled the
Union Trust Company out of $16,000 by
forging his father's name to drafts for
verious amounts.
The mail steamer was six days eleven
hours and twenty-seven minutes coming
up from Honolulu, so she did not make as
good time as the Moana, which made the
run to the Farallones in six days and five
hours. Captain Filmer reports bad
weather throughout the, voyage and a
heavy head sea from Honolulu to San
Francisco. Dr. Hartog is the physician
who left the Moana at Honolulu In order
to make a quick passage on the Hong
kong Maru, and Miss L. C. Kennan is the
young lady who was to have wed George
W. Woodbury on his return from Austra
lia. Her prospective husband died two
days after he reached Sydney, and his re
mains came back on the Moana.
The steamer Townsend sailed for St.
George Island yesterday with diverÃ and
wrecking appliances to get the steamer
Laurada oft the rocks, but after steaming
as far as the lightship had to return. John
Fitzsimmons, one of the oilers, got his
hand caught in an eccentric and four of
his lingers were cut off. The vessel was
at once put about, and on her arrival at
Melggs wharf the wounded man was
landed. Another oiler was procured and
the Townsend made another start.
Captain MeKenzie is in command of the
Townsend, but Captain Frank White of
the Laurada is in charge of the wrecking
crew and "Jack" Koach is the heaa
diver. The party is positive that the
Laurada will be got off the rocks, and
Captain White has taken along Martin
Flaherty to act as his chief officer as soon
as the wrecked steamer is afloat. The
Laurada has a cargo in her hold valued
at over $150, 000, and if the wreckers cannot
save the vessel they should get enough of
the cargo to more than pay the expenses
of sending the Townsend north.
The steamer Gipsy had to put back
again yesterday morning. She went out
Friday night, but the bar was too rough
and Captain Leland came back to Broad
way wharf. Yesterday another start was
made, and while the Bteamer was passing
OUt First Assistant Engineer John Green
was thrown against the machinery and
dislocated his shoulder. The Gipsy was
put about and the tirst assistant was land
ed at Melggs wharf. An engineer to till
his place was procured from the Marine
Engineers' Association and the vessel pro
ceeded to sea.
There was considerable speculation
along the front yesterday over a story
that came from Angel Island. The sol
diers on leave from the detention camp
say that a boat containing four persons
capsized off Point Blunt Friday after
noon. The boat disappeared into Raccoon
Straits, but no trace of the occupants was
seen afterward. The inference drawn by
the soldiers was that the people in the
boat were drowned. It appears that Bap
tiste Batsinzi, John Lauy, Frank de -Mar
tini and Eddie Sche*l secured a boat at
Lombard street wharf and went for a
sail. Off Angel Island they were cap-
Sized, but got on the bottom of the boat
and later were rescued by Oscar Lewis
and John Kerwin in a Whitehall. An at
tempt was made to tow the boat back to
Lombard street, but it failed. The four
boys wire nothing the, worse for their
ducking.
The transport Leelanaw came off the
drydock yesterday, where she has been
repaired, and the big ship Arthur Sewall
will take her place. The Sewall will be
the largest vessel that has ever gone on
the floating dork.
captain Storrs of the Leelanaw is going
out as master of the Matteawan and Chief
Officer Harding will take the Leelanaw
on hi r next voyage to Manila. Captain
Connor of the Matteawan is going- ]Â£ast
to take command of another of the com
pany's .vessels.
The transport Westminster is out in the
stream, and as a berth cannot be found
for her the quartermaster is not saying
very complimentary things about the
port. The fr< right for the vessel is all on
hand, but nothing can be done until she
can be got alongside one of the Wharves.
If the, weather permits the Manauense,
Tartar. Conemaugh. Olympia, Centennial
and Pennsylvania will get away to-mor
row. Stores and horses have to be put
aboard the different vessels, and if this
cannot be done it may be Wednesday be
fore any of them can depart. Chief Of
ficer Rickmers of the Conemaugh Is not
going out this trip. His place will be
taken by Second Officer Horton of the
Pennsylvania. Mr. Rickmers has been
for nine years in the. employ of the Em
pire Steamship Company and is held in

Captain Trtanor, late of the schooner
Manila, has almost completed arrange
ments for building a splendid four-masted
vessel for the coast trade. Captain
Treanor was part owner in the Manila,
and took her on her maiden voyage to
China with a load of lumber. After dis
charging he received instructions from
the managing owner to return to Puget
Sound in ballast. At that time of the
year it would be almost impossible to
make the great circle passage, so Captain
Treanor accepted a charter to load sul
phur at Hakodate for San Francisco, and
arrived here in due course. The manag
ing owner criticized the captain's action
so severely that he resigned, and Captain
Peterson, late of the steam schooner
Aberdeen, took command of the Manila.
The new schooner tor Captain Treanor
will be built by Matthew Turner at

current of dissatisfaction among the Ba

of the object of the commission. They
think that the commission was sent to
tho islands to give them a new govern
ment instead of to make investigations
which would form the basis of a report
to ha forwarded to tho three powers for
thorn to act upon.
"The natives cannot disassociate the
commission's limited powers from the
ability to actually substantiate a new
form of government for them, and conse
quently they have been looking for the
new order of things to commence ever

SIMPSON UNLOADING OIL
STOCK ON THE TEACHERS
School Board's Secretary Ac
cused of Double Dealing.
Accepted One Thousand Shares to Act as
Hidden Treasure Company's Agent
Among City Pedagogues.
JA. SIMPSON, secretary of the
Board of Education, Is making
0 use of his official Dosition and
the power that is in It to further
the interests of the Hidden Treasure Oil
Company, of which he was recently
elected president. As a grafter Secre
tary Simpson has transcended the dizzy
heights attained by the Gedge-Conlon-
Armstrong oomblnation and has got In on
a proposition that bids fair to make him
hundreds of dollars for every nickel that
was realized by those other worthies of
the School Department. Every fact In
the case the Board of Education Is in
formed of. Simpson himself, when con
fronted with proof of his double dealing
with the city, daxed make no denial, and
it Is probable that an investigation more
searching than that into the affairs of the
Supplies and Buildings and Grounds Com
mittee will be made.
Simpson does not need the paltry salary
he receives as secretary of the School
Board. He Is heir to the estate of Dr. J.
A. Simpson, and his wealth is estimated
at from $250,000 to $400,000, but he is an old
time lieutenant of Phil Crimmins and by
that political worthy was placed in office
In order that political manipulations
might be made the easier and more suc
cessful when they were connected with
the School Department. Secretary Simp
son himself was willing to take the Job,
as the history of previous school boards
had taught him that there is no more
richly dollar-strewn ground under the
control of the city and county govern
ment.
The Hidden Treasure Oil people were
as quick to see Simpson's commercial
value as he was to accept their subse
quent proposition, and they consequently
approached him through one of his warm
est friends, Bruce B. Kimmis of 201 Turk
street with a proposition to take the pres
idency of the company and 10"0 shares of
thÂ« capital stock for doing so.
Simpson demurred at Ilrst. School scan
dale were getting Into print pretty regu
j larly at that time and he had no stom
ach for anything of that sort; but it was
cleverly pointed out to him that with a
thousand shares of his own and 30,000 of
the company's he ought to make fair
money in unloading a considerable por
tion of it on the teachers at 50 cents a
share. Then he accepted and since that
time has fairly earned the presidential
honors which were thrust upon him.
The company was incorporated only two
weeks ago with J. A. Simpson appearing
on the papers a? president, R. W. Priot
vice president, Bruce B. Kimmis secre
tary and George Higgins, the oil expert,
and George Wiggens as directors. The

BUILDING ITS
CASE AGAINST
JOSEPH FRENNA
Turner Murderer Will
Soon Be Tried.
Preliminaries have been settled and the
prosecution Is ready to proceed with the
trial of Joseph P. Frenna, who shot J. F.
Turner in the Crocker building about two
months ago. Frenna's case Is on Judge
Cook's calendar for Tuesday morning, but
It Is probable that a continuance will be
granted, as another 'case precedes it.
During the several weeks that have
elapsed since Frenna sent five bullets Into
his victim's back a local detective agency
has been busy in an effort to obtain evi
dence to prove that Turner was a fighting
man, but with poor success, while, on the
other hand, the prosecution has succeeded
in a like effort regarding Frenna.
The prosecution Is convinced that the
motive which prompted Frenna to murder
Turner was to prevent his being arrested
on a charge of perjury, alleged to have
been committed during the trial of the
several charges against Turner instigated
by Frenna. It is said that Frenna pre
ferred risking trial for murder with Tur
ner out of the way, on the contention that
he acted In self-defense, rather than go
into court as a defendant charged with
perjury, with Turner living. In any
event, the prosecution Is satisfied that It
will be able to carry its case to a suc
cessful conclusion with the motive named
as the cause of the assassination. Frenna
will doubtless allege that he acted in self
defense, but in the event of this being
nullified by the testimony of witnesses
that Turner was shot in the back, Frenna
will set forth emotional insanity as a de
fense, said emotional Insanity being
caused by the action of the dead in rob
bing his slayer of several thousand dol
lars. In anticipation of such a defense,
the District Attorney Is prepared to show
that such a contention cannot have a
basis, as witnesses will testify that Fren
na not only acknowledged that he got
back all the money he loaned Turner, but
that he received as high as |50 a day in
terest on a loan of $3000.
The prosecution will prove that in Oc
tober of JS'Jo a settlement was effected
between the murderer and his victim.
Frenna receiving $6000, with Interest, and
rcconveying all the securities he held to
Turner, including a $24,000 mortgage and
valuable property in Modoc County. The
trouble between Frenna and Turner was
caused, the prosecution will further show,
by a statement made to Frenna by Laur
ence S. MeggiriHon that the securities re
ceived from Turner were valueless. At
that time Frenna threatened to kill Tur
ner. Additional .securities were given and
trouble was averted. Witnesses will tes
tify that Miss O'Donnell, Turner's sten
ographer, told them that Frenna would
kill Turner unless restrained, and this,
coupled with the testimony of a local
broker that Frenna acknowledged that he
was settled with Turner and refused to
make a statement of any debt, is, in the
mind of the District Attorney, sufficient
to secure a verdict against Frenna of
"guilty of murder in the first degree.**

its stock consists of 32S acres of land near
fepanlshtown in San Mateo County, upon
which, as in many other sections round
the bay, pronounced indications of oil
have been discovered. A derrick has been
moved on the ground and arrangements
are being made to begin boring within
the fortnight, but the members of the
company do not care to assumo all of the
risk that necessarily attaches to an oil
proposition. Consequently they have is
sued 100,000 shares of stock, par at a dol
lar, and placed 30,000 on the market at 50
cents. It is these 30,000 shares that Simp
son has been paid to unload upon the
hundreds of school teachers in the de
partment.
It was a clever business stroke that
placed Simpson at the head of the com
pany. It is a well-known fact that there
is no more frugal class of saJary-earners
in the city than the teachers in the pub
lic schools. There is hardly one of them
that has not anywhere from $100 to some
thing up in the thousands, saved up lor
sate investment or against a rainy day
and now that the oil fever has lilt the
town they are dragging out their shekles
to blow against a proposition tuat offers
a chance to make them $50 on $1, where
the average safe investment yields them
not over 6 or S per cent per annum.
The company took all these conditions
into consideration and also the fact that
no official of the School Department was
in a position to do the teachers more of
the favors that are vital to them and their
welfare than Simpson. After so figuring
they offered him 1000 shares of stock to
use this influence of his for his own and
their gain and Simpson is using it to the
Queen's taste. The deputies In his ottice
are performing the unprofitable routine
while he is out among the oedagogues
writing certificates. In fact, Simpson has
gone so far with his new proposition that
he yesterday gave orders to the depart
ment carpenter to erect in his office at
the City Hall a cabinet in which he pro
poses to display samples of oil taken from
the Hidden Treasure diggings.
When Simpson was confronted yester
day with proof of the fact that he was
using his position for his own personal
gain he did not deny the charge. ''Sup
pose I am unloading a little stock on the
teachers? said he. "I have got as much
right to do it as any one else and our
proposition is as good as that of any of
the companies that are floating stock on
the exchange. It is a bona fide proposi
tion; we have got our machinery and are
going ahead with our work; all we want
is money to do it with. Tnere is Plenty of
it in the School Department and if the
teachers want to take a chance with us
they have got a right to do it." With Mr.
Simpson's innocent view of his graft the
School Board, however, doÂ«s not agree
and it is possible that either Mr. Simpson
or the oil company will go out of business
in that neighborhood as soon as the Im
minent Investigation is finished.

race Davis won the respect of the
assembled voters by his manly and mode.-t
utterances. The policy for the betterment
of San Francisco which he outlined was
applauded. He did not dwell on his own
past services to the city and State and na
tion, but gave his views as to what should
be done for San Francisco's future under
the new charter. He acknowledged the
warmth of the ovation which the splendid
audience gave him in tones attesting the
sincerity of the acknowledgment. Every
one In the assemblage, and there were
many ladies â¢present, lending an influence
of refinement to the occasion, knew that
Horace Davis was sincere and honest In
his utterances. They knew that he was
rot a time-serving politician, employing
the arts of a demagogue to catch public
lavor for his own political gain.
Every seat In the main auditorium and
In the galleries was occupied before the
meeting was called to order. The first
outburst of applause, which throughout â 
the evening became so frequent, was j
â¢when Hon. Horace Davis stepped onto the
p'latforrn with the speakers. His appear
ance was the signal for a mighty and a
hearty cheer. Eugene F. Bert was the
chairman of the evening. In opening the j
proceedings he stated that he desired to
refer to what appeared to be a little an- j
cient history.
'I want to refer back to a week ago, In
this very hall, when we ratified the work
of our municipal convention. During the
week the Democrats have been circulating
the report that the meeting was sparsely
attended, that there was no enthusiasm
and that in reality there was no ratifica
tion at all. Now. I want this audience to
hurl back tho lie to them by cheering so
that they can hear all along the highways
and the byways that we are here in large
numbers and that we are full of confi
dence and enthusiasm." The cheers were
given with a will, and the hint given by
the chairman was followed out during the
entire evening. When the shouting ceased
Mr. Bert hurled defiance at the Demo
crats and closed his remarks by saying:
"If this is a cold audience, then let the
Democrats make the most of it."
Colonel T. B. Eddy led the list of speak- i
er.*. Hla address was on the bearing that :
national politics have on a municipal '
c impugn and of tht> absolute necessity
and propriety of bringing them into the
affairs of the city. He lid that he had
the privilege of occupying a seat in the
gallery ami watching the deliberationsâ [
he .stated that he used the word advisedly i
â of the late Democratic convention.
"I was astonished," said Colonel Eddy,
"to hear their standard-bearer say that
thf municipal election had nothing to do
with national Hairs. Is it that Phelan
wns afraid that when lines were drawn
â as they ought to be in this campaignâ
he and his colleagues would be buried out
of Fight? Bryan said at Denver, after
leaving here, that San Francisco would
fro Democratic and that would Indi

"I shall go back to Manila," said the
Â»Â«neral yesterday afternoon at the recep
It Is the paramount duty of Â©very Repub
lican to stand by his colors."
A selection by a male quartet followed,
and then Hon. Horace Davis, candidate
Mayor, stepped to the front of the
platform. No candidate for public office
: have wished for a more hearty
greeting than was accorded him by the
audience. Cheer upon cheer * rang
: through the building. For several miif
.he din was terrific, but gratifying.
As the cheers were dying away a small
buy high up in the gailery cried out,
"What's the matter with Davis?" The
I took that as a signal for another
of shouting and yelled until It waa
I to quit from pure exhaustion.
When things quieted down so that his
could be heard Mr. Davis said:
â¢'I appreciate a reception like this, be
causts it comes right from the hearts of
my ft ::ow citizens. I am here to-night
: our programme and what we
Be to do to carry out our promises.
In many material things the city has en
j tered upon a new era of prosperity. The
desire to improve and expand the city
has been born anew in the hearts of the
citizens. This same civic spirit cvim l
in a new form of life for the city
when we adopted the new charter. We
awh . out of our shell and we
are going out Into the world with more
determination to make our city the great
est municipality of the West.
"When the charter was presented to the
people its acceptance came from the Re
publican districts of the city. Every dis
; trkt that voted against it was Demo
cratic. I want you to make a note of
j this. If any special credit Is to be given
: for the charter tt certainly belongs to the
! Republican party, it is not necessary to
:re you that I am a friend of the
: charter. I was chairman of the charter
entlon and when It went before the
1 Legislature I used all of m>- Influence to
have It ratified.
"Municipal government Is a great busi
ness affair. A municipal corporation
j should be managed like any other corpor
ation â on strictly business methods and
principles. When we go before the peo
ple we must do so as advocates of that
i policy. It becomes like any other Insti
tution spending great amounts of money,
: and thÂ«= people are Interested in know
nig how and by whom it is handled.
! "I think that one of the first things
â¢â  that should be done when the new char
i ter goes into effect is to put the city in
; a sound sanitary condition. Next
, the hospitals. If I understand the re
i ports of the Grand Juries, the condition
! of the City and County Hospital is any
: thing but creditable to the city. It Is a
, spreader of disease ratner than a place
where cure is to be effected. These are
things that require immediate attention.
"And the schoolsâ we are ail proud of
j our public school system. 1:
: you know, is the cornerstone of the re
] public. I am assured by well informed
men that our schools are insufficient in
I number and In many cases dangerous and
i unhealthful. One of the first things to
!be done by the new city government
should be supplying the needs of the city
in that respect.
"The Merchants' Association has
adopted a very commendable platform,
:.g placing wires underground, con
tinuing the present street cleaning
tern, better street pavement ana salt
water for sewer flushing. 1 would go
further. I believe In the city acquiring
Its own wattr supply. We can wa.it un

public utilities, but so Interlaced with mu

D. E. McKlnlay was the next speaker,
and his remarks aroused the great audi
ence to the highest pitch of enthust
He said in part:
"1 feel very good to stand here to-night
and declare to you that I am now a citl

I will, without preliminaries, say that in
my 'pinion the coming election is one of

and county of San Francisco. To some It
may seem â to a few who have been tem
porarily blinded or led astray by the ex
travagant claims and equally extravagant
arguments of the Democratsâ that the is
sues of the present campaign are slightly
mixed. But there is nothing clearer to
those who will make intelligent use of
eyesight and of their reasoning fac
ulties than these same issues with which
the people of the city are now confronted.
The main issue, the issue which demands
the greatest consideration at our hands at
this time, is whether we shall place the
government of San Francisco undec the
barter in the hands of the Demo
crats or whether we shall place that re
â¢;. in the hands of the Repub

"I am not urging my husband to altor

little sadly, "for I don't think that that
would be right. He is answering as he
wishes. Though It will be harder to re
main at home, I believe, in suspense, than
it would be to go back to Manila and bear
the climate, for there I am able to at

that he is well, while here I shall be in

SAN FBANCISCO, SUNDAY. OCTOBER 22, 1899.
by Mr. Davis. I am â¢willing to give the
Democrats all the credit to which they
are entitled. The fact Is, and can easily
be substantiated, that the Republicans
had fully as much to do with the compila
tion of the charter as the Democrats, and
they had far more to do with its ratifica
tion and final approval by the Republican
Legislature and by a Republican Gov
ern or."
After another song or two by the Knick
erbocker Quartet, Chairman Bert intro
duced E. Myron Wolfe, who said, among
other things:
"It has been said that the election that
is now close at hand is the most import
ant in its bearing and probable effect upon
the future of San Francisco of any in
the history of the city. I am of the opin
ion that that is so. but I have no fear of
the result. Just so long as the people cast
their votes as their intelligence dictates,
just so sure am I that the glorious future
of the city is assured. A great deal has
[ been said about what the Democrats have
dons for the city and for the country;
but what have they done? What gTeat
policy, national or municipal, are they re
sponsible for? What great movement
that has resulted in good for the country
have they inaugurated? These questions
are unanswered, and they are unanswer
able. They are not backward In claiming
credit for everything: they are the cham
pion clalmers of the country, but their
claims cannot be substantiated."
Mr. Wolfe contrasted the recent Demo
cratic municipal convention, which was
i together Pimply for the purpose of
indorsing the nominees selected by two or
three men. and the Republican municipal
convention, which selected as its nominees
representative men of the entire Republ:
party of the city. He closed with a
glowing eulogy of the grand qualities of
the head and heart and the exceptional
administrative ability of Horace Davis.
"the next Mayor of San Francisco," a
tribute that received the uproarious ap
proval of the audience.
WARNED BY FRIENDLY SPIRITS
NOT TO EAT POISONED CANDY
Scenes and Actors in a Candy Comedy.
BY the timely warning of her guid
ing spirit Miss Judith B. Dwyer,
clairvoyant and medium, clams
that a plot to murder her was
frustrated. A small box of choc
olate candies in which were inserted
great chunks of bluestone was to have
been the agent 6t death. Miss Dwyer
very thoughtfully refrained from eating
of the candy. Had she swallowed the
sweets she might not have lived to tell
of the conspiracy. Physicians state that
the action of the drug on the human sys
tem is somewhat similar to that which
the rolling of the sad sea waves has on
a person inclined to become seasick. Miss
Dwyer insists that she never saw the box
of candy until it reached her .through
the mall and does not want the impres
sion to prevail that she put up the Job
on herself for advertising purposes.
Business jealousy, she says, is the only
motive any one could have for attempting
to send her to the other world by the
bluestone route. Miss Dwyer rooms at a
Market street boarding-house kept by
Mrs. Louisa Reed. Last Wednesday
morning the postman brought a small
parcel on which was pasted the address
of the medium, cut from one of her circu
lars. The package was handed to Miss
Dwyer by the landlady. She had not
opened It when Uia landlady's daughter,
I Lucius L. Solomons closed the evening
i with one of the most telling speeches de
i livered. Between the records of Hora< c
! Davis and Mr. Fhelan he drew a powerful
parallel, by which the "Mayor in per
petuity* suffered sadly. He unmercifully
grilled those Republicans whom the Phe
lanites claim elected their prophet at the
. last election, and boldly declared that the
! Republican who this year cast a Demo
cratic ballot would stamp himself a traitor
to his party. He was cheered to the echo,
and so bunched his telling points that at
times it was with difficulty he proceeded.
The meeting rinsed with ringing cheers
for the Repubiican standard-bearer and
for the party.
DEMOCRATS ARE
CULLED B Y A
POTRERO FROST
Phelan Gives a Mild
Rebuke.
By actual count fifty men, twenty
seven boys and three women attended
last night the Democratic mass meeting
of the Thirty-second Assembly District
in the Potrero Opera-house. A band
Miss Ella P. Reed, entered the room, re
marking that seme one had been kind
enough to send the spiritualist a present
of a box of candy. Miss Dwyer shook
the package and expressed the belief that
it contained samples of ore on which she
might exercise her occult powers in deter
mining the value of the mine from which
it had been taken
The rock theory was dispelled when the
wrapper was removed from the box. The
contents proved to be a badly disarranged
lot of ordinary chocolate creams. A,.^
Dwyer picked up one to taste it and so
did Miss Reed. They were simultaneous
ly struck with the thought that {he con
fectionery might be poisoned. Miss Dwyer
recalled the spiritual warning and visions
of the Botkin case flitted before the eyes
of Miss Reed. Thn process of tasting the
stuff was discontinued just as their lips
touched tlje chocolate.
Breaking open the candies chunks of
rocks of bluish tinge were discovered
floating about in the soft cream. "It is
bluestone," moaned Miss Dwyer. "Me
hated rival has been foiled by me faithful
spirit," and then both of the women
donned their best attire and > e nt to a
nearby drug store and passed the pack
age up to a chemist. "Sulphate of cop
per," he Bald, and the Intended victims of
the nauseating dose hastened away to the
Chief of Police. Detective McMann was
given the case.
Misa Dwyer claims that for several
weeks she uas been receiving anonymous
played for an hour, a bonfire blazed a
welcome, but no invitation was strong
enough to bring from their homes the
thousands of workingmen who are in the
district. The Democrats expected last
night to find a crowded hall. They spoke
in chagrin to empty benches. In the very
home of the workingmen the agitators
were unwelcome. No more significant cir
cumstance perhaps has cast its shadow
upon this campaign. There are between
and 8000 workingmen in the district.
Fifty made a chilly representation.
As might have been expected, the speak
ers were dispirited. They were hardly
themselves, as talking to the echo of
one's own voice is not particularly inspir
ing. The best of a bad situation was
accepted and R. P. Doolan was announced
as the first speaker. As far as the mu
nicipal campaign is concerned to him it
means simply the election of R. P. Doo
lan. He told what a splendid official he
will make if given a chance. Emile Pohli
was the next speaker, and with James P.
Booth divided the honors of the evening.
P.oth delivered good addresses, outlining
the principles of government they set k
to set in operation under the charter.
They asked a vote for the entire Super
visorial ticket, of which they are mem
bers.
Jerome Deasy was the next speaker,
advocating as usual his own candidacy.
Charles TVesley Reed told his tale of con
vention woe, denounced "the old squaws."
and asked his friends to stand with him
with even greater tenacity than before.
Mr. Reed held the platform longer than
!â¢â  wish. d. It was his awful duty to hold
the audience until the Mayor arrived.
About 9 o'clock the straJn was beginning
to tell upon the audience. Charles Wes
i ley's tale of woe was not entertaining and
one by ore his auditors were drifting into
the street. And then the Mayor came and
saved the day.
His Honor was cad. He said that he
letters threatening her with annihilation
unless she left the city in a specified num
ber of days. She says that she believes
when those who threatened her discov
ered that she was not to be intimidated
they determined to put her out of the
way by means of the poisoned candy.
Business rivalry is what she claims to be
the motive of the deed. Unfortunately
her guiding spirit did not advise her to
preserve the letters. The good spirit of
Miss Dwyer was guarding her carefully,
however, and wurned her at least a week
before the arrival of the bluestoned con
fectionery. According to the story told
by the woman yesterday to a representa
tive of The Call the warning came to her
one night just as she was about to retire.
"I felt a hand touch me on the shoulder,"
she said, "and distinctly heard the words,
'Beware, you are in danger.' Immediate
ly a vision appeared before me. At first
it was hazy, out as it became distinct
I saw myself as I expect to appear in
death, dressed in my funeral shroud. "
The chemist who examined the candies
says that the bluestone was placed in it
in such large chunks that it would have
been impossible for a person to have
swallowed it without detecting its pres
ence as soon as the sweets were placed in
the mouth. He further states that blue
stone acts as an emetic and that only in
exceptional cases could it produce death.
The police take no stock in the theory
that an attempt was made to murder the
medium.

had been greeted by large audiences all
over town, and really the people ought
to make some sacrifices. The Thirty
second District, he declared, had been
friendly to him in the past and he asked
for a renewal of the confidence which
had so often been asked and given. He
came to give, he added, on account of his
stewardship. Then a happy thought
struck him and he announced that the
wily postal authorities had conspired to
make the meeting a failure by not de
livering the postal cards of notification.
The only other new or significant part of
his address was a slur cast upon the con
vention which nominated him.
"The people at the primaries gave me
my nomination," he said; "I owe it to no
combination or convention and I am per
fectly free to act as I please."
When Mayor Phelan had finished half
of the small audience had left the hall.
Major Geary then repeated that thread
bare speech of his. He is still on the
firing line, sniffing gunpowder, and speaks
war. There is some thought of burning
red fire the next time he talks. The major
made a false play last night, but it was
not altogether his own fault. He should
have held the crowd until another spell
binder arrived, but he retired, leaving
only Joseph M. Gumming, who is con
fessedly not an orator, in the hall. Poor
Gumming talked like a steam whistle; he
looked nervously and anxiously toward
tho door. He shifted from one foot to the
other in desperation. He talked about
nothing in particular and heaved a sigh
of relief as Assessor Dodge entered the
hall.
A minute later the Assessor was dem
onstrating that wonderful fact of his. He
said he was particularly unfortunate in
reference to the Potrero. "Last year,"
he said, "I got here late and only ad
dressed a handful, and here I am late
again this year, but if you will wait a
few minutes I will show you some
charts." And then followed that dreary
chart exercise. The Assessor was fol
lowed by Lewis F. Byington, Osgood Put
nam, Patrick Boland and Dr. R. Beverly
Cole. It seemed an omen of disaster that
the nominees for Coroner and Public Ad
ministrator should close the meeting.
When the meeting adjourned seventeen
men and five boys were in the hall.
Maennerbund Hall, on Potrero avenue,
near Twenty-fourth street, was well tilled
when the chairman, Eugene Sullivan,
opened the meeting of the Thirty-third
Assembly District by introducing Lewis
F. Byington, candidate for District At
torney, who urged his own election be
cause be had kept his pledges. He asked
his hearers to support only those candi
dates who were friends of the charter,
and was followed by Patrick Boland, can
didate for Public Administrator; L. J.
Dwyer, candidate for Supervisor; Dr.
R. Beverly Cole, candidate for Coroner;
A. B. Maguire, candidate for Supervisor,
and Franklin K. Lane, candidate for City
Attorney. The latter was well received
and made a speech that, quite won his
hearers. Edmond Godchaux. candidate
for Recorder, amused the audience by re
ferring to his diminutive size, which ho
said, however, would not interfere with
the proper fullillment of his duties should
he be elected. Judge Mogan made a plea
for his re-election on the ground that he
would temper justice with mercy, and
H. U. Brandenstein, candidate for Super
visor; George H. Cabanis, candidate for
Police Judge; R. P. Doolan, candidate for
Tax Collector, and Peter J. Curtis, can
didate for Supervisor, all made pathetic
entreaties for the suffrage of their fel
low citizens.
Charles Wesley Reed was the next
speaker and was eloquently telling how
he and his colleagues, if elected, would
remove the City and County Hospital
from the Mission district, when a con
vivial individual in the audience shouted:
"Why, you fellows have been promising
that for the last ten years and you have
not done it yet."
The serg^ant-at-arms quieted the re
fractory individual, and the speechmaking
<>n without interruption. After James
P. Booth, candidate for Supervisor, had
made a facetious speech, which was well
received, Mayor Phelan entered the hall
and was given a rousing reception. He
practically repeated the speech he had de
livered earlier in the evening. While dis
claiming any intention of being boastful,
he proceeded to inform his hearers all
about what he and his Democratic breth
ren had accomplished. At the conclusion
of his remarks he was given three cheers.
J. Deasy. candidate for Sheriff; Al Fri:z.
candidate for Police Judge, and Assessor
Dodge also addressed the meeting.
Silk's Hall, on Mission street and Pre
cita avenue, where the meeting of the
Thirty-fifth Assembly District was held,
contained but half the original audience
when Mayor Phelan arrived at 10:30
o'clock. Some small boy proposed three
cheers when the Mayor entered the hall,
and they were given with a will. The
Mayor went over the same ground as he
had done earlier in the evening, and prom
ised to do all kinds of good things for the
Mission district, which, he said, had been
negated in the past, while the Western
Addition had been getting all the impr.^vi-
ments. When he concluded he was asked
a pointed question by one of his auditors
as to why the Thirty-fifth District hsd
not been "given a single nomination for
Supervisor, while the Thirty-third had re
ceived two. Phelan replied by saying that
the nominees had been selected without
reference to districts, with which small

YACHTSMEN MAKE MERRY.
Corinthians and San Franciscos Hold
Their Closing Entertainments.
Both the San Francisco and Corinthian
Yacht clubs gave the Closing entertain
ments of the season yesterday. At ti.e
San Francisco clubhouse, Sausallto, there
was a reception, dance and entertain
ment, beginning at 8 o'clock fn the even
ing, at which many of the members and
their friends were present. Refreshments
were served and a pleasant evening was
enjoyed. Most of the guests returned to
the city by the 10:50 boat.
At Tiburon, on the arrival of the 6:30
boat from San Francisco, the Corinthians
at once sat down to a bountiful supper
of the good old sort prepared under ti.e
direction of Port Captain John A. Keefe.
After the supper, at which several mem
bers of the California Yacht Club were
present, a jinks was given. No set pro
gramme had been prepared, but the per
firniprs sat in the front of the house and
contributed according to their varied tal
ents whenever called upon. Not only
were the regular Corinthian entertainers
present, but also several other well
known i>erformers, who are not so famil
iar to Tiburon audiences as Frank W.
Thompson, E. F. Sagar. W. Howe, H.
i Hawks. W. Crowell, "Jack" O'Brien and
F. H. Bushnell. Frank Coffin and J. Ep
pinger, tenors; J. MrÃride, basso; Nel
son H. Girard of the Tivoli. the Hawaiian
i trio. M. Kramer and C. Henley, pianists,
contributed to the impromptu jinks.
Toward midnight a launch left Tiburon
to bring back to the city those of the per
formers who must be here to-day.
This morning, whatever the weather
conditions may be. the Corinthians, ac
companied by some of the California
yachtsmen, will take the last cruise of
the season, under special orders from the
commodore. The San Franclscos will also
probably go out for a sail during the day.
The California^ will wind up the season
with an informal entertainment at their

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Oct. 21.
The board of lady managers of Fabiola
Hospital are planning a novel affair as a
benefit to their hospital fund, in the way
of a. "Madonna" exhibition. It is to be
given within a month and will be not
only a large and very fashionable func
tion, but at the same time one that will be
interesting and instructive. The plan is
to collect paintings, engravings and the
like of the Virgin and make of them an
artistic display. A number of very fine
canvases are owned by Oakland. Berke
ley and Alameda residents and these will
be borrowed. A short address will be de-*
llvered on the subject, and there will be
appropriate music, including the "Aye
Maria." The exhibition will be held at the
residence of Mrs. Edward M. Herrick on
Broadway. Mrs. John Yule will head the
reception committee, which will consist of
some of Oakland's most prominent society
and philanthropic ladies. The event is be

disgrace and that he would strongly
recommend the erection of a new building
of a size and finish in harmony with the
importance of San Francisco as a rev

He held many conferences with Col

California delegation were appealed to,
with the result that early in the coming
session of Congress Senator Perkins will
Introduce in the Senate a bill to appro
priate $2,500,000 for the construction and
equipment of a new Custom-house in this

shall be of three stories, somewhat after
the architectural style of the Custom

New York without funds, she replied that
she had a good voice and knew how to
use it. Sheriff Grlswold got possession of
: her trunks.
Shortly after she had been taken to the
prison Lieutenant Charles P. Plunkett. V
S. N . who fought at the battle of Manila
Bay and was a passenger on the steamer,
drove up in a hack carrying a bouquet of
violets, which he presented to her. He re
mained In the prison with her till she was
taken to the ferry by the Sheriff and Ser
geant Wolf, and ordered the hack driver
to follow them to the ferry, as he would
see her off on her journey by last even-
Ing's train to Jamestown. He said that
the American Consul had asked him to
look after her during the trip, and he had
done so.
Sheriff Griswold said that Miss Vlnton
had previously eloped with a married
man, but he was not familiar with the
particulars. He thought that was the rea
son why she came to live with her aunt
in Jamestown. She positively declined to
be seen by newspaper men.
In her purse wa3 found a clipping of the
following lines by Edwin Arnold, entitled
"Consummation," and she seems to nave
lived up to them:
Somewhere thoro waiteth In this world of ours
For one lone soul another lonely eoul.
Each chasing each through all the lonely hours.
And meetinK strangely at one sudden coal.
Then blend they like green leaves with golden
flowers
Into one beautiful and perfect whole;
And life's !onÂ«c nljht Is ended, and the way
I.irfs open onward to eternal day.
AN ORIGINAL DEVICE
Which Is Followed by a Still More
OHginal Device.
i To poorly Imitate show windows and
slrtis. have a store that looks In a super
ficial way like Charles Lyons', may at
times induce a stranger to make a mis- i
take, but he will find he Is not up against i
the real thing.
The Imitator may by suc.h devices ac- |
I cure a stray customer at times, but If he
cannot deliver the goods such artifices are
I of little avail with the public.
Charles Lyons' house does not depend
on show windows, etc.; his business is run
on the following lines:
He gives the fullest value for the money.
He has all his cloths specially manufac
; tured for him. and has his own exclusive
| patterns. He does an immense business
; and carries as large a stock as any whole
sale cloth house.
Lyons wishes to caution the public who
desire to do business with him that he has
I only one store on Market street, numbered
721, In the History building:, carried on
: under the name and style of Charles
Lyons, the London Tailor. He has noth
ing whatever to do with any other store
on Market street, but has a branch at 122
Kearny street. â¢
ChinesÂ© Club Raided,
Twenty-six fan-tan players were ar
! rested In the rooms of the San Fran-
I cisco Chinese Merchants' Association at
| 122 "Waverly place by the Chinatown
'â¢ squad last evening. The officers . have
i long experienced difficulty In landing the
| gamblers In this club behind the bars, but
I yesterday they fitted up a trap for the
i wily Cci eat lain and la addition, pa malt-
Ing the arrests secured complete evidence.
The Chinese were In the habit of throw-
Ing the evidence down a flue, the opening
in which was concealed behind a secret
p;inel. The bottom of the flue was tapped
by the officers, and as fast as the para
phernalia of the game were cast off by
the gamblers they were recovered by the
police.
Garfield League Social.
The Garfleld league gave an entertain
ment and ball at their hall, 507 Sutter
street, last night to the participants In
the Garfleld memorial exercises held re
cently. Musical and literary exercises
were participated in by E. M. Galvln.

THE GROWTH OF
THE OIL INDUSTRY
Causes an Association to Be Formed.
At Its Headquarters in the
Mills Building
THE PRODUCERS' OIL EXCHANGE
WLLL OPEN TO-MORROW.
California has had Its days of Gold,
Fruit and Farming, and now our lead-
Ing capitalists are opening up a new
era for Investment by the development
of the oil fit-Ids, and many companies
have been formed which have acquired
lands and are boring for oil. In con
sequence of the great activity and de
mand for oil stocks the Producers' Oil
Exchange has been organized by those
Interested In the oil fields, capitalists
and brokers. The public will thus have
the opportunity of seeing dally quota
tions of oil stocks and giving their or
ders to the brokers to buy or sell, as
they may require.
The Producers' Oil Exchange has
taken every precaution possible to ex
amine Into the standing of the various
oil companies before allowing such
companies to list their stocks, and
those buying and selling through the
brokers of the Exchange will thus have
the protection of the Exchange.
The first session of the Producers' Oil
Exchange will be held to-morrow
(Monday), the 23d., at 11 a. m.. in its
rooms on the ground floor of the Mills
building. Preparations have been made
to entertain a large number of people,
as every one is Invited to attend. Mr.
George W. Terrill, the president, will
open the session. Then the chairman,
Mr. Joseph I* King, will take his place
at the rostrum and give people a
chance to buy and sell oil shares
through the medium of the brokers.
Great excitement has been created
lately by the discovery of more oil wells
and doubtless this will stimulate the
trade at the first session of the Ex
change. Wt learn that the Producers'
oil Exchange is indorsed by nearly all
those interested in the production of
oil and thÂ» association is to be con
gratulated in having listed on its board
the best companies, not only those ope
rating: in the producing- Coalinga field,
but also In other sections of the State.
No companies are listed without the
payment of the regular listing fee of
$100.
Parties desiring to invest In oil
shares are recommended to visit the
Exchange, where they will find the
secretary ready to give general Infor
mation as to companies and the terri
tory In which they are operating. This
information Is derived from experts
employed by the association, who are
constantly in the various oil fields.

handsome compliment to one who during j

devoted a great deal of time to the order,

prominent of the lo<:al parlorss which has

Califorrda Commissioner Suggested.
Isider Jacobs has a suggestion inai ni.iy
be of interest to business people. He says
that he believes a California Commis
sioner, with headquarters at the national
capital, would be aWe to do much good
for California, in the making of reci
procity treaties in which harm is uninten
tionally done to the incTMstries of Califor
nia, and also in the? framing of modifica
tions of tariff laws, it would be of great
value to have a man at the capital who,
having expert knowledge of the various
interests of the Stsjte. could furnish ac
curate information. He would have tnÂ«
Commissioner weJl up in traffic mattprs
also. Very likely Mr. Jacobs will bring
the matter up Â±or consideration before
some one of the commercial bodies in

HEWITT GETS GRILLED
BY A POLICE JUDGE
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, Oct. 21
Attorney R. E. Hewitt, who was con
victed yesterday of violating: the city or
dinances requiring cyclists to equip their
bikes with a bell, was sentenced by Police
Judge Smith to-day to pay a fine of $20.
Hewitt had been corralled by the police
In a recent raid on cyclists and he warned
Officer Lynch that the latter "made a bie
mistake" In arresting him, and that "yon
will hear from this." He claimed he had
a whistle on his keyring and that ho was
in the habit of blowing it at all cros.sinjj.s
but the officer and other witnesses testi
fied he exhibited but two keys on the ring
For such violations cyclists have hereto
fore been fined $1 as an example and
warning, but in Hewitt's case the fine was
fixed at $20. and incidentally the Police
Judfre virtually accused the defendant of
perjury.
"There were three reputable witnesses
who testified to the same facts In this
case," said Judge Smith, "and you took
the stand, and, under oath to tell the
truth, denied their statements. You con
tradicted yourself on cross examination,
not only once, but at least a hajf dozen
times.
"You are an attorney at law and under
oath not to mislead any court by willful
mlsstatement of facts, which you have
done; and I believe, as was stated by the
Prosecuting Attorney, that you willfully
told what was not true on the witness
stand. Now, It is the Judgment of this
court that you pay a fine of $20, or in lieu
thereof spend one day in Jail for each $2
of the fine Imposed."
Hewitt Immediately gave notice of ap
peal and filed a bond, with H. L.. Sims, a
stationer, and W. T. Aahley, a grocer, as
sureties.

EBELL LADIES HONOR
THE RETURNED HERO
Oakland Office Ban Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Oct. 21.
BRIGADIER GENERAL AND
MRS. FREDERICK FUN
STON were tendered a recep
tion at Ebell Hall this after
noon, to which Oakland society, despite
the frownlngs of the clouds, turned out
en masse. The affair was the first large
function given by the Bbell Society
this season and waa extremely fash
ionable.
The hall, under the direction of the
Misses Crellln, was most beautifully
decorated for the occasion. , Mosses of
cosmos and ferns were employed to
brighten the scene, and flags lent a
patriotic and military tone-, the na
tional colors being draped about the
platform, while smaller standards
hung from the walla. The vari-colored
gowns of the ladles, contrasted with
the more somber dress of the many
gentlemen present to help welcome the
Kansas hero, made the scene most
brilliant. The hall was darkened and
the gas lighted.
At 3 o'clock, the hour for the begin
ning of the reception. General and
Mrs. Funston arrived, accompanied by
Mr. and Mrs. Otto Blankart and Mrs.
W. O. Cullen, the parents and sister
of Mrs. Funston. They were escorted
by Mrs. Roland P. Gleason, president
of Ebell, to a place near the platform,
where they were presented in turn to
the guests, the receiving party con
sisting of General and Mrs. Funeton,
Mrs. Cullen. Mrs. Gleason and Mrs.
Vernon Waldron.
The general reception committee for
the society consisted of Mrs. W. A.
Childs, Mrs. Kate A. Buckley, Mrs.
Franklin Bangs. Mrs. I* S. Burchard,
Mrs. J. W. McClymonds, Mrs. J. R.
Scupham, Mrs. John Russ, Mrs. C T.
Rodolph and Mrs. Beth Mann.

Ranch Won With Alicia at
10 to IâThree1 â Three Choices
in Front.
Threatening weather did not prevent a
large crowd of enthusiasts from traveling
across the bay to Oakland track yester
day. The track was muddy, which ac
counts, perhaps, for a reversal or two
and the downfall of three of the favorites
as well. The talent seemed to be in afflu
ent circumstances and the books enjoyed
the liveliest betting day of the season.
No doubt young Ranch, on the Oregon
mare Alicia, furnished the biggest sur
prise of the afternoon in the mile and a
sixteenth free handicap. She started ear
lier In the week with Buchanan up, but
that youngster was unable to make her
gallop. As pond as 10 to 1 was laid yes
terday and she led from start to finish.
k Morinel, the favorite, out four
lengths. Ward, on the latter, furnished
a wretched ride, losing half a dozen
lengths turning Into the stretch. New
Moon was also a disappointment, falling
to the rear before a mile had been cov
ered.
On Friday Dan Honlfc's Katie Gibbons
started In a race, wearing bar plates, and
showed no speed to amount to anything.
On that occasion she was ridden by fiac-
Closkey. In the opening event at seven
furlongs, the Buekmaster filly was asked

From 8 until 8 o'clock the gallant
â oldler and his bride greeted those
who had come to honor them. Gen
eral Ftinston, a little more grave, a
little more military than when he
sailed with his regiment from San
Francisco for the Philippines, was In
full uniform. Mrs. Funaton stood at
his right and was gowned In pink silk,
with a lace overdress. Her paleness,
acquired under a trying Oriental sun,
made her seem prettier though less
girlish than when she left for battle
ecenes to be near her fighting hus
band. Mrs. Cullen was In yellow silk,
and looked most charming. Mrs.
Gleason was In black silk; Mrs. Wal
dron In gray.
Refreshments were served at half
past 4 by a coterie of ladies under the
direction of Miss Josephine Klein.
They were Mrs. Milton Bulkier, Mrs.
Tyler Henshaw, Miss Catton and Miss
Jenkins of the State University; Miss
Pope and Miss Ethel Gage. The re
freshments consisted of frappe, coffee
and fancy cakes. While the guests
were enjoying the menu Alfred Wil
kle, the tenor, rendered "Amo" and as
an encore "The Sword of Bunker
HIM." Mr. "Wllkie's voice has re
gained Its past beauty and strength
since his very severe illness, and his
singing was greatly enjoyed.
Though It had been informally an
nounced that either General or Mrs.
Funston would speak for a few mo
ments during the reception neither
did so. The general, modest as he Is
brave, Is not overfond of speech-mak
ing and would rather face a Spanish
or Philippine battery than an assem
blage. Mrs. Funston was excused
also. She is very tired with the long
voyage and has been compelled since
her return to refuse many Invitations,
Colorado, a 3 to 5 favorite, and did It
most impressively. â¢â¢Peach" Honig de
cided to dispense with the bar plates, and
Katie won with Thorpe pulling up to a
walk The favorite led San Carlos out
eight lengths for the place. The winner
was heavily played shortly before post
Flvlng Magdalenes showed some of her
old-time speed in the five furlong spin
following, Just missing beating the 1 to 2
favorite Hlo Chlco. Songer had the mount
on Magdalenes, which was backed from 8
to 5 to 1. and when the barrier was releas
ed she shot to the front, opening a gap of
eight lengths between herself and the
field Tiring perceptibly as the wire was
nearefl, she began backing up, and Ruiz,
who bad ridden a very persevering race
on the favorite, earned the decision by a
scant half length. Billy A as usual had
speed, but failed to stay. There was a
well developed play on Sport McAllister
at short od.ls, but the veteran sprinter
seems to have soen his best days.
Garnet Ferguson's good St. Lee colt
Alee annexed the two-year-old dash with
out great effort. The youngster, with
M ounce in the saddle, closed a 4 to 5
choice and won all the way. Much was
expected of Gundara, the 6 to 'i second
choice, but after showing some early
speed the filly suddenly dropped out of it.
Giro piloted by Mike Bergen, cut <iuite
a dash out in front to the stretch, where
he began stopping and lost the place to
Jolly Briton.
Imperious, the bay son of Morello. cap
tured the six furlong handicap, after a
hard battle with Etta H and Sorrow.
With different rides both of the last
named mares might have beaten him.
Thorpe rode Etta H. which had a com
manding call In the ring, and he mad.' en
tirely too much early use of her. Chas
ing off after Negligence the first part of
it his mount began wobbling badly the
last furlong from the fast pace traveled
and was overhauled by Ward, with the
leg up on Imperious. About this time
Buchanan, astride Sorrow, came with a
ruÂ«h. compelling Ward to ride out hard
to win by three parts of a length. It was
the only pretty finish of the day.
The concluding mile selling run resulted
In the easiest sort of a victory for Lovdal,
only yielding In the present case be
cause of her deep Interest In both
Oakland, her old home, and her regard
for her friends and her desire to meet
them all and her wish to comply with
any request from the Ebell Society, of
which her sister. Mrs. Cullen, Is a
prominent member.
The fact of General Funston's op
tional orders for the Philippines, re
ceived to-day, was the only dampen
ing phase of the reception, for the
rain evidently deterred no one. Mrs.
Funston, however, pronounced the
showers most appropriate to the news,
for she will see her husband return to
Manila without her with deepest re
gret.

Track Notes.
Miles Finlen, the wealthy mlneowner
and horseman of Butte, Mont., was a
spectator at the track yesterday. Mr.
Finlen Is the owner of the useful per
former Lucky Star and over a year ago
was credited with cleaning up $20,000 when
that horse won at Chicago. C. Christy,
a mining man of Anaconda and a lover
of the horse, is also here on a brief so
journ.
When Rio Chlco won his race Willie
Sink had to stand a $200 raise. Entered
for $200 the gelding was boosted to $400 by
Johnny Cavanaugh, acting for Book
maker Phil Archibald. An old difference
in money matters caused the trouble. '
Dan Dennfson is expected almost any
day now at Oakland track from Montana
with the immense string of Marcus Daly.
After the sharp improvement in speed
shown by Katie Gibbons in yesterday's
race, over her noticeable lack of that rac
ing necessity "n the day previous, Trainer
"Peach" Honig and horses and Jockey
McCloskey were suspended pending an in
vestigation.
Trainer Fretl Edwards was also cau
tioned by the stand to be more careful
about starting horses not ready to race
In future. The improvement displayed by
M.iMialenes brought about the censure.
Ed. Powers, a very competent horseman
aa well as turf correspondent, has receiv
ed the appointment of patrol Judge for
Tanforan Park.
The conditions of the new California
Jockey Club Futurity will probably be a
revelation to the Western turf * world
when Issued in print. It was decided yes
terday by the management of the Oak
land Association to give the same amount
in added money as that in the great
Eastern Futurity, usually the richest
stake of the year. It will thus eclipse all
other stakes ever contested for in this
section of the country.
Negligence was oveVflowing with speed
yesterday. As he came out of the pad
dock the sprinter ran away the reverse
way of the track with Kellas, concluding
by jumping the fence near the six furlong
starting post. Both horse and rider es
caped injury.

ACTIVE CANVASS
FOR SHE FUNDS
Alameda Out With a
Challenge.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, Oct. 21.
Money for the purchase of a site upon
which to build the free library is coming
in very slowly. Up to date only $7200 has
been pledged, and the lowest amount con-
Bidered necessary is $30,00% For the past
two weeks nothing whatever has been
heard of the project. No meeting has
been called and nothing has been done
publicly.
G. Russell I,ukens. who took the initia
tive in organizing the site fund commit
tee, says that some of the members have
been out of town and that accounts for
the apparent lack of energy. They have
now returned and the matter is to be
taken up in earnest.
There is still an. opinion prevalent in
some quarters that it would be better to
place the library to be built with Mr
Carnegie's money on one of the public
squares. J. H. \V. Sohst, a director of
the Merchants" Exchange, has made pub
lic his reasons why the library should
be placed on l,ineoln square. Some of the
City Councilman also favor this idea
which seems to be advanced more be
cause it would do away with the neces
sity for raising money to purchase a site
than for any other reason.
It is about concluded that the matter
shall be left to the Board of Library
Trustees and they shall select a site and
approve the plans. When the matter was
first heard of much haste was shown in
every direction, but for the past month
little has been heard of the matter. Ala
meda, which has a site and has been prom
ised by Mr. Carnegie that he will give
the final $10,000 toward the erection of any
building they may decide upon, has pro
claimed that she will collect the neces
sary money before Oakland, which has
had two months' start, shall obtain the
money for her site. The manner in which
things are working at present has caused
Alamedans to declare that the odds are
now in their favor.
"The matter is going along all right."
Bald G. Russell Lukens. "and we shall as
soon as possible decide upon a plan of
canvassing that will include the whole
city. At present over $7000 hafl been prom
ised, mostly In large amounts. This Is
not a matter, however, which could be
attended to by a few people Everybody
should consider it a privilege to subscribe
toward a handsome free library, and the
work of obtaining subscriptions should be
so arranged that everybody would be
given an opportunity to subscribe. In
a few days this matter will be well un
der way. We are losing nothing by do
ing a little thinking as we proceed, and I
may say that many available sites have
already been thought about by those in
terested in the matter, though of course
nothing definite has been decided upon."
BODY FOUND FLOATING
NEAR OAKLAND MOLE
OAKLAND. Oct. 21.â The body of a
man, supposed to be G. Bergold, appar
ently about 45 years of age, was found
floating In the bay, just south of the Oak
land pier, this morning. The discovery
LADY SHOLTO DOUGLAS
IS BACK ON A VISIT
LADY SHOLTO DOUGLAS.
OAKLAND, Oct. 21.â Once again Lady Sholto Douglas Is In California.
Her ladyship arrived early this evening at the home of her mother,
Mrs. Margaret J. Mooney, 1419 Linden street, this city, direct from
Glasgow, Scotland, whence she sailed on the sth Instant. She is
accompanied by her little son Bruce Francisco, lord elect and heir
prospective to the Marquis of Queen sherry's estate.
Her ladyship returns with a decidedly English accent, yet a manner un
assuming and far from that which so frequently marks the transition from
the ranks of labor to wealth and title. The environments of Lord Sholto
Douglas' mansion at Cheltenham, the comforts and ease of a titled lady
with many servants at her command, and the necessary association and
mingling with lords and ladies of the Knglish aristocracy have not les
sened her love for the land of her birth or its people, or the comparatively
humble home of her mother and kin.
Before her ladyship married Into the family of the Marquis of Queens
berry she was Miss Loretta Addis-Moon^y. a music hall songstress of con
siderable talent and versatility. The story of how she first met Lord Sholto
Douglas at Bakersfleld, while she was there in a music hall; of how he met
an English rival In the attentions he lavished upon her, and how the young
lord's rival had hoped to accomplish a coup by having the lord arrested on
a charge of Insanity; f/ouglas' release and his victory and final marriage at
San Jose nearly five years ago, has all been exploited, and even now her
ladyship feels keenly the newspaper notoriety accorded her love affair at the
time.
Lady Douglas left California a little over three years ago and -went to
British Columbia, in accordance with the wish of the Marquis of Queens
berry, who desired that an heir to the family title should be born on British
soil. After the birth of little Viscount Bruce her ladyship and Lord Douglas
went to England.
There has been a little doubt as to how the Marauis and Marchioness
would receive the little California girl who was mother to the direct heir to
the house of Queensberry. In England there are many ideas regarding vau
deville artists and singers, but Lady Sholto soon convinced her august father
in-law and mother-in-law that if California does not produce titles It sends
out women with an Independence and womanliness that make them the peer
of British aristocracy. The old Marquis welcomed the little singer warmly,
and at once declared that little Bruce was a worthy scion of the line that is
6o closely identified with the world of sport.
Her ladyship was met at Benicla by her brother, Augustus J. Mooney;
her sister, Margie; her uncle, J. W. McNeil, and a small party of friends. She
was quite fatigued from the long Journey, but cheerfully assented to give
6ome of her impressions and views of domestic life among the English aris
tocracy.
"Oh, It Is so good to be back In America again, and particularly In Cali
fornia," said her ladyship. "But really, the past four years have been the
pleasantest in all my life. My husband is very pood, and I like our home at
Cheltenham very much, but we spend a great deal of our time at the Mar
quis' home In Cadogan place, London. I've been through England, France,
and Scotland, and I think England is delightful. I sallrd with baby Bruce
from Glasgow on the sth of this month, while Lord Sholto is hunting In Eng
land. We arrived in New York last Monday, but we stopped there only
about four hours and hastened right on to my old home in Oakland. We
both enjoyed the trip very much, but are quite fatigued. We are both
very well otherwise. Bruce had been suffering from a cold, but the ocean
voyage did him good, you know. And now I suppose you would like to know
how I was received in England. Well, I can only say that I got a very good
reception from all sides. Now, there you are, and if you misquote me, re
member it is going to be different from what it was last time, when so many
unkind and ridiculous things were printed about us. This time you'll hear
from England. Why. It was perfectly outrageous the way the papers went on
about us. Why, one woman writer said I had big feet and shoe-button eyes,
or something to that effect, and really I sometimes feel a little prejudiced
for the many unpleasant things said about us.
"But, after all, America is my home, and although I'm awfully fond of
England' and English people, there's no other country like America, and
particularly California. Indeed, I love America, where the people are good;
but, really, when they are bad they are very bad. And, don't you know, now
that I've been away several yearsâ away from all those reporters and news
paper people that do not run after you In England as they do hereâ it really
seems ridiculous. In England they don't fuss about whether you're going
to live or die; but here they're after you continually, particularly if your
name is adorned with some title.
"We Americans are an independent nation," she continued, "and don't
think anything about titles; yet they always run after people of title to
learn about their private affairs. They ask you is your husband delicate and
has your baby five fingers just like everybody else's baby. Oh, it's absurd!
The Americans pretend not to care for titles, yet they always gloat over the
visit of such as have titles. Really, of what importance am Ito the American
people? I'm just as much theirs as they are mine. I may have more servants
now and a larger and more beautiful home and every comfort in life, and I
may have attended many more social functions In London than here; yet I
am sure I will find it really more comfortable in the old home of my girl
hood."
The overland train carrying her ladyship and son was due in Oakland this
forenoon, but was nearly seven hours late. So greatly fatigued were the
travelers that almost immediately after Lady Sholto Douglas had been greet
ed' by her mother in her old home she retired and would be seen by no re-
P Â° r iler ladyship will sojourn in Oakland until about Christmas time, when
her husband is expected to arrive, who will accompany her on the Journey
Mrs Mooney is simply delighted with her little grandson. "He is thÂ© Jol
liest little baby in all the world," she said to-night, "and I'm proud of him,
as I am of his lordship, his father, who loves Loretta and who has always
been good to her, as well as to all of us."

LS3B.
Australian Gold.
The Moana brought up from Australia
11.1K.951 In English sovereigns, making $.12.-
T. 3.126 thus far this year and $50,539,001 since
the Influx began In August. 1897.
Barley and Oats.
The circular of George Morrow & Co. gays:
BARLEYâ Receipts for the -week. 118.933 ctls.
Despite this rains the deal In December Bar
ley goes merrily on. Good, heavy rains In
October are surely Indicative of a wet winter
and abundant harvests next rear. Possibly
Ihe heavy export movement this year may
â¢nable the holders of Barley to hold the mar
ket up, but with lots of Barley in sight and
still unsold they certainly have a heavy cor.
tract.
The local demand for Feed Barley contin
ues normal. Brewers are still in the field
for desirable lots and shippers willingly take
bright export Barley at current rates, but as
a. rule they make the rates.
OATS â Receipts for the week. 25. 560 ctls. Re
ceipts show an Increase over last week of
about Â£000 ctls. but the movement from the
north haa already begun. Of this week's re
ceipts the States of Oregon and Washington
contributed, say BSOO ctls. showing that Cali
fornia has by no means exhausted her own
supply of feed Oats.
Except for choice Oats the outlook Is not
bright and we rather look for lower prices
tor stained northern Oats. Good milling Oats,
either gray or white, are In good demand.
Strictly choice white Oats are In even better
Semand. owing to their ecarcltv. The market
for off-grade Oats Is dull and somewhat In
clined to weaken. Reds and blacks are firm.
but have not as yet advanced any to speak
of. The end of the present storm should bring
about a good demand for both reds and blacks
for seed.
Dried Fruit in New York.
The New Tork Commercial says: "The gen
eral conditions of the market are unchanged,
except that the firmness In some lines appears
to be Increasing. Buying Is principally of
small lots, though the aggregate amounts to
b large business. Spot Roods are moving
freely at full quotations and some shortage is
noticeable already, or at least some difficulty
in filling orders is experienced. Prices are
with advancing tendency and It Is prac
tically impossible to secure any concessions
from holders.
"Sales of Prunes are small, though negotia
tions for some fairly large blocks are reported.
So far there has been Tittle eu*culatlve buy
ing, and now speculators are not finding their
task easy, owing to the Impossibility of se
curing supplies of the four sizes. Sales are
principally of the three sizes of St. Claras at
Sc basis, f. ii.*-.. In bags. Four sizes are said
to command Tc Outside goods are a trifle
lower, but sales are not large. The supply will
bÂ» ample for all requirements, but up to the
present time holders have made no concessions.
It seems, however, that buyers are more will-
Ing to meet the views of sellers, and heavier
transactions are likely to result.
"Raisins are selling well at the present rate
of prices, and the prospect Is that there will
be an advance in the near future. Foreign
Raisins, especially Malagas, are in rood de
mand at full prices. The high prices of do
mestic Raisins have helped the foreign goods,
and the outlook Is that there will be further
increases in the near future.
"Peaches are firm, but trading la slow, be
cause the situation is becoming complicated.
"Western speculators axe holding a number of
hundred cars. It Is Impossible to say how
many, which are entirely out of the market
for the time. Added to th!Â» there are Increas
ing reports that the output will not be as
large as was expected. The result Is a hard
ening of the market, which promises higher
prices.
"Apricots are firm at full previous prices
Jobbers are the only holders, and they have
n<Â» supplies of Importance on hand. ThÂ»Â»y hold
everything firm, refusing to make concession
en large lots."

EASTERN MARKETS
New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK, Oct. 21. â The traders in atocks
wen unable to Induce any noticeable movement
In prices during the two hours of trading. The
bear? wer> unable to attack the industrial spe
cialties when it became evident that the bulla
were not In an aggressive mood. Sales for
spot account were in evidence In the apeclalties
Mn:e of which dropped off a point or over.
I'.^rillzinK was also manifest In Pullman and
New V' rk Central, but the decline In prices
brought out no large offerings of stocks and
the bears had Kenerally covered their contracts
the bunk statement appeared, bringing
prices back to about last nlpht 8 level. A nom
inal Increase In the surplus reserve was seized
upon by the bulls to rush up the price of sugar
In an attempt to indue* a following. They were
as unsuccessful at the bears, and realizing
caused a reactionary tendency in the whole
list, which was very narrow In its activity. Tho
closing, therefore, was easy at trivial net !
changes either way.
The main features of the bank statement
were a repetition of those of last week. There !
Is nothing in it to encourage an expectation of
easier money, but as last week's similar state
ment led to no renewal of money stringency,
the stock market was Inclined to the view that
this week's showing might lead to no worse re- |
suit. The uneasy and undecided movements of
professional stock operators have caused a con
fused and Irregular movement of. prices. As i
the professionals were still largely committed
to the short side, the closing up of accounts has '
resulted in higher prices. That the short inter- ;
est has been largely reduced as a result of the |
week's operations and the strength of stocks
thus technically weakened Is a safe assump- .
tion.
In the bond market there was quite a steady !
absorption of long term, well-secured bonds at <
or below par and of '. per cent denomination.
Indicating a pressure for investment for capi
tal contented with that rate of return in spite
of higher Interest rates on money prevailing.
This development in bonds gave a firm under- ;
tone to the stock market, and the level of j
prices In many cases at present rate of divi- |
j dends Is Inconsistent with the high Interest j
' rates ruling.
The official compilation of the September 7
reports of the whole country shows that the
loans which had been called in by. the New
York banks had been put out again by other \
banks in the progress of the country's business
expansion. The New York contraction from :
June 30 to September 7 of $46,000,000' represented
speculation and liquidation in the stock market,
while the increase in loans of outside banks of
$50,000,000 indicated industrial expansion. The ;
exhibit cannot be called unfavorable even from
a stock market standpoint, if intrinsic values I
are considered rather than speculative boom j
j values.

Associated Banks' Statement.
NEW YORK, Oct. 21.â The Financier says:
The associated banks of New York city lost
H.3TS,"SÂ«n cash as a result of the operations of
the week just elapsed, but the reduction of re
serve requirements to the extent of $1,642,000
enabled them to a<ld something over a quarter
of a million to the surplus, bringing the ex
cess cash up to $1741,025. The cash decrease
was due entirely to the movement of rands
to the interior, sub-treasury operations having
been In favur of the t.,uik.s.
Interesting feature of the statement lies
In the continued decrease in loans ana 1 6 â 
its over the summer and fall season. Since
:- i of June ihe banks have reduced their
outstanding loans no less- than ; "â¢ â  . while
ts have contracted over 1140,000,000. As
â¢ins the c;ius. >, operating to bring about
the shrinkage, it is worthy oV note tiiat one
Institution which transacts mrre i r less busi
ness with the treasury has contracted its de
about $33,000,000 from the high point In
as a whole held on .nine 24
and legal ten 'â 
- Qt tha amount now report
ed. Figures like these go to show tin- enor
mous decreases which the banks have sus
tained since the open] miner. How
long this liquidation Is to continue is a mat
ter of conjecture. It does seem that the tide
must turn n
Making allowances for higher prices and the i
requirement of an increased business at the
Interior points the fact remains that many
country banks are carrying more money than
I usual, and now that the crop season Is ending
i it Is only natural that the surplus coming Into
, these institutions should seek lodging places
in the larger financial centers. There are .
â¢ bankers who profess to believe the return vol
ume of money this fall will be smaller than
usual, owing- to changes in conditions yet
hardly appreciated. The easier condition In
money abroad is regarded as Important by
financiers, who read from the falling quota
tions a definite answer to the fears expressed
: only a few days since relative to possible ex
; ports of gold. ThÂ» outward movement of
grain and cereals may serve to hold exchange
. Quotations at a safe level.

Chicago Grain Market.
CHICAGO. Oct. 21.â Wheat opened weak and
for the first two hours cultivated further heavi
ness. Lower cables and" Indications of a heavy
inlcrease In the visible supply discouraged
longs, who began to liquidate freely from the
start. The harket showed considerable stub
bornness, however, yielding grudgingly, and
when finally the price grot a fraction below the
parity the buying became so widely spread that
a rally ensued, the opening: loss being- regained
But the Improvement was only temporary, as
the bulls lost confidence owing to a flood of
bearish statistics. Then liquidation and short
selling began to weigh the market down again
and It continued to slump until the end, closing
â¢weak at the bottom of the day's range. Decem

The circular of Scott & Magner says:
"Receipts of Hay for the week Just ended
nave been a great deal less than for some t!mÂ»
They have amounted to 2661 tons. . The rain
j has Interfered with the movement to market,
and the scarcity of both railroad cars and boats
has caused an Immense amount of Hay to be
come damaged that would have been moved
Into market before the rains. A large propor
tion of the Hay that Is arriving has been more
or less damaged. Such Hay Is selling; at some
what of a discount on our quoted prices. Hay
In order sells readily and Is a little firmer.
When the present rains are over it Is generally
expected the market will be found to be In bet
ter shape for the selling interests.
"Arrivals of Alfalfa Hay have not been as
heavy this week, although they have been
active enough for the present demand. A large
proportion of the Alfalfa Hay Is sold on arrival
to dairymen, and must be hauled quite a dis
tance to their dairies. The roads since the
â  rains are In poor condition, which makes sales
and deliveries slower. The market therefore is
dull and movement slow."

RTVAIrS DRIED FRUIT AMD
RAISIN CROP.
Tacts and Estimates Carefully Gath
ered From a Reliable Official
Source Concerning a Thriv
ing HornÂ© Industry.
Somo largo figures were recently pub
lished in The Call showing that the dried
iruit crup of the State will approximate
fla.OuO.OOo In value this year. According
*.o the best advices, the dairy products
will approach the value of the dried fruit*
und ndsiiis. A large amount of data has â 
been collected at the offices of the State !
iJairy Bureau on California street, from
Which the deduction is drawn that the
lotal valuo of the various dairy products
â will be fully 112,500,000 for the year ending
October 1, iSiiy. This is in excess of the
value for thu preceding year of $2,000,0U0. ;
Coupled with several other facts in
connection with the industrial and linan
cial conditions obtaining In the State at
this time, the statement cannot be other
wise than pleasing. Among the other j
facts are the enhanced value of the dried
fruits, and especially the raisins; the fact
That there are such offerings of business
this year that it la impossible to get cars
Â«=nough or ships enough to move the
freights out of the State promptly; also
iho fact, iirst mentioned in The Call, that ;
The deposits in the savings *tnd commer- ,
cial banks of the Stato are Increasing at j
the astonishing rate of $2,000,00 v per month
and that all deposits In the savings banks,
city and country inclusive, average over
siuu per capita for depositors.
The totals of dairy products, estimated
In dollars, last year, were as follows:
Value of 23.651.521 pounds of butter, $4,354,
--235; value of 6,14a, 372 pounds of cheese.
$0i3,43'j; value of milk and cream con
sumed, $4,T1i,250: value of calves from
dairy cows, $562,630; value of hogs pro
duced at creameries and dairies, J745,595.
The total of all items last year was $10,
--103,473.
William Vanderbllt, agent and secretary
of the titate Dairy Bureau, has received
a great number of reports from creamer
ies and individuals and dairies during the
past few weeks. His conclusion is that
me returns will very closely correspond
â¢with the returns for the year ending Octo
ber 1, I^7. The exact total for 1887 was
$12,461,363. In that year the butter pro
duced in the State amounted to the very
large total of 28,678,439 pounds, estimated
to be worth $5,573,617; and the cheese was
worth $569,666, the amount in pounds
being Col'O.&S. At the same time the milk
and cream consumed were worth $4,669,480.
The forthcoming report of the bureau
â¢will show that the dairy properties in the
San Joaquln Valley are still increasing.
iMuch dairy interest has been transferred
from the coa.st counties, where it was
formerly supposed to be placed for all
time. The drought Last year led to the
pale of a great number or dairy herds to
people in the San Joaquin Valley, who,
with irrig-atiun and alfalfa crops, were
able to lind feed for all the cattle they
bought. Five years at the San Joaquin
Valley bought all its dairy supplies from
the coast counties. Now there are nu
merous creameries in the valley. The
Fame is true of the Sacramento Valley to
some extent. There is one creamery at
("ourtland, Sacramento County, that will
show a total output of 406,600 pounds of
butter for the year. There are creameries
at Stockton, Lodi, Newman, L.athrop, Los
Eanos, Merced, Fresno, Porterville,
AVoodvilie, Tulare, Visalia and Bakers
liold. Thus the line extends from one end
<>f the valley to the other. The creamery
at Fresno has twenty sub-stations al
ready, and alms at a much larger number,
the sdm being to manufacture the dairy
products for the county.
There are 262,000 dairy cows in the State,
which, estimated at the very low valua
tion of $30 per head, are worth nearly
?5,000,000. The creameries are worth at
leapt half of that amount and tho land
used for dairying is roughly estimated to
be worth four times as much as the
dairy herds. Among the largest owners
r>f dairy cows are the following: Charles
â \Vebb Howard. 1,350; Shatter estate. 2200:
Novato Land Company, 900; Fhebe
Hearst, 1000.
PURGED OF CONTEMPT.
Xie-atenant-Colonel Leonard Makes a
Satisfactory Statement and the
Proceedings Against Him
Are Dropped.
Ldeutenant Colonel Robert "W. Leonard,
â commanding the Twenty-eighth Regi
ment, U. S. V., appeared in the United
States District Court at 9 o'clock yester
<lay morning with Charles Hook, the 17
--year-old boy who had enlisted. in Com
pany F of that regiment without tho con
tent of hi 3 mother. The lieutenant col
onel took the stand and declared that ho
TioA bad no Intention of treating the court
-with disrespect, but he had not under
stood that the order required him person
ally to briny the boy before the court.
As tho officer was evidently ignorant of
any law except that of court-martial, and
as It was clear from his statement and
appearance that no offense had been In
tended by him, he was declared purged of
contempt end the proceedings were dis
missed. The boy was discharged and
â placed !n the custody of his mother.

When baby comes to the home it will
bind the wife closer to the husband, or
it will gradually tend to cut her off from
his companship. A sickly mother loses
in physical charm, aud often in temper
and disposition. A fretful child is a
trial, even to loving parents. The use
ol Dr. Pierces Favorite Prescription
prepares the wife for motherhood. It
strengthens the body, and induces a
healthy condition of mind, free from
anxiety or fear. It makes the baby's
advent practically painless. The mother
being healthy her child is healthy, and
a healthy child is a happy child, a joy
to the parents, linking them together
with a new bond of affection.
There is no opium, cocaine or other
narcotic in " Favorite Prescription."
" I read what your medicine has done for
other people," writes MrÂ». Edwin H. Gardner,
of Beech wood, Norfolk Co.. Mass., Box 70, "so
thought I would try it, and I found It a blessing
to me and family. I took your medicine a
year when I had a ten pound girl. I had the
easiest time I ever had with any of my three
children, and I have been very well ever since.

RABBITS OFFICIALLY NOTICED.
Department of Agriculture Thinks
California Has a Source of
Wealth Undelveloped.
The Government of the United State*
has become interested in the subject of
jackrabbit fur in California. A letter has
been received from the Department of
I Agriculture by Herman Waldeck, which
was signed by T. S. Palmer, acting chief,
of the Biological Survey, in which is the
following passage; "i notice in the San
Francisco Call that you are about to
make an experiment In utilizing the skins
of jackrabbits. We shall be glad to hear
whether your experiment proves a suc
cess. I see no reason why It should not, in
view of the large Importation of Austra
lian rabbit skins, which is now necessary
to supply felt for manufacturing hats."
Mr. waldeck is naturally pleased at thÂ«
interest manifested by the Government.
He said yesterday that he had not yet
reached any satisfactory conclusion,
blnce hia Intention to try the experiment
he has had many communications from
people in various parts of the State. He
has instructed several persons concerning
what they will have to do to determine

ALASKA'S GREAT FUTURE.
Among the distinguished arrivals of the

bach, who has spent some time in the
pnowy fastnesses of the Upper Yukon.
The colonel is very enthusiastic concern-
Ing- the future of Dawson. and he pre
dicts great things for the entire territory. ;
He says, that nearly all of the Callfornians
Who went north to win fortune are doing
well and that some of them are progress
ing so rapidly that it will not be long be
fore they will be able to return to their
homes in civilization with enough to in-;
sure them against anything in the shape
of poverty for the rest of their natural
lives.
The colonel is one of the tK-st known
; men In the north, and though his head
quarters are at Dawson, he has interests
all over tho Territory and Is conversant
with tho affairs of all the mining camps
along the river. Speaking of the recently
eered diggings at Cape Nome he
said:
"We have been experiencing 1 quite an
exodus from Dawson for the new dig
gings, which are very rich, but I don't
think this exodus will do Dawson any
great harm. On the contrary, I believe It
will do the camp considerable gnod. The
miners who have gone down the river
will clear tho town of Its surplus popula
tion with the result that wages will pro
up and every one will have ail they can

NOT GOOD AS
LADY TEAZLE
The rain drenched drearily outside the
California, and within Nance O'Neil made
a dreary failure in "School for Scandal."
It was not a nice evening.
With her big, untamed beauty, marred
by the artificial dress of the play's period,
she was not even a "handsome Lady Tea
zle. Far sadder than this, she was not
a real one. There was no tripping', no
sparkling; there was dull and heavy
plodding, and a Lady Teazle that lagged
over Jines where she was meant to
twinkle.
Tempest-tossed Nance can never, never
do it. Give her a role where emotion Is
forbidden and she moves lifelessly. "The
School for Scandal" offers her one snatch
of a scene, where she can be herself, and
she makes the most of It. But Lady Tea
zle's serious moments are the rare mo
ments of her bewilderingly glinting career
and she and Nance O'Xeil were born to
disagree.
Mr. Edwin Mordant- did the best work

ing It. He seems to feel more at home

FORTUNE TELLER'S LUCK.
Alice Martin Creates a Sensation in
Judge Conlan's Court.
There was a scene of excitement In
Judge Conlan's court yesterday during
the testimony of Alice Martin. 1 Fifth
street, the complaining witness in the
case of Trixie Dillon, charged with grand
larceny in stealing two diamond rings
fnim her of the value of $100.
Alice testified that when she missed the
rings she at once accused Trixie, who de
nied taking them. "I told her," said Alice,
"that I had been to a fortune-teller a few
days ago and was told that I would be
robbed. I asked her to go with me to the
fortune-teller and we might find out who
stole the rings. She fit iiret refused, but
finally consented. When we reached the
place Trixie would not go inside and
walked away. The fortune-teller told me
that Trixie had stolen the rings. 1 '
There was instantly a general demand
fir the name of the fortune-teller. Judre
Oonlan said he would like to know if the
charter would be sustained or rejected.
Prosecuting Attorney I/>w said he would
like to know if he would be elected Police
Judge. Others expressed their desire to
(â â¢â¢liHiiit the fortune-teller, and the prob
ability is that she will do a rushing busl
ness fÂ«T the next few days.
The case for the prosecution was con
cluded and a continuance granted till next
Wednesday.

Good Hope is too well known to herÂ© re

has ever been one of his characteris
tics.
The ceding of the Cape to Great Brit
ain in ISI4 lor the sum of $30,000,000 and
â¢ome BpÂ«.clal considerations marked the
beginning of the trouble between the
Boers and the Kutllsh, which hua con
tinued until now.
The early administration was not well
managed. There was a most marked
Jealousy between the then free Dutch and
the English along" the lines of maritime
developmentâ a condition which demand
ed a mot-t liberal recognition, as well as
diplomatic manipulation. Rivalry became
friction; friction became hatred; hatred
expressed itself In dissunsiunâ until the
Boer became openly hostile; and an enemy
was created where better understanding
miKht have secured a friend.
Among the chief causes of rupture in
the early stage of Anglo-Dutch icultiea
was the sudden abolition of slavery and
the unsatisfactory way in which claims
were adJusted.VThe methods of the mis
elonariea were also vi.pleasing, as they
â¢xpected of the Boer a philanthropy
which he did not and cannot understand
The Boer had always felt himself superior
to the native. X the native was willing
to obey him: nil went well; if not the

the discussion terminated; the Boer taking
charge of his widows, which fact accounts
tor a largo part of th<; mixed population

The Boer looked upon the acts of the
missionaries a3 expressing the sentiment
of the British Government; and uncon

result.

criticisms, but was made necessary by
the old spirit of rebellion and Boer dia

period of prosperity, but Indifference and
criminal negligence provided the very en
vironment which Kruger and his com
panions desired, and which kept alive the
feeling of unrest and contempt of law
they hereditarily knew bo well how to
utilize. The Government agents were
simply anesthetized, while the crafty Boer
embodied his wacht-een-beetije (wait a

whon he seemed most prodigal of report,
and being most guilty of intrigue when
seemingly most anxious to be frank.
There was no fear of Oom Paul commenc

a trot and noisily announced our presence.
My companion and myself found our
selves about 800 yards from the kopje ab

a head. It seemed a miracle that we es

gradually our men worked into the firing

the volunteers and regulars fell, but the

double quick in the face of a heavy fire.
Ug went a white flag from the Boer po

asked me to accompany his orderly, one

and Hamblen's "We Win." Since the
novel was Invented, nearly every corner
of the human spirit has been explored for
subjects, and nearly every type of human
nature studied and tormented in the
manufacture of heroes. After historical
novels, local novels, class novels, problem
novels, we have "occupation novels."
Naturally it is the bolder occupation,
those which afford scope for heroism,
that have first been chosen for treatment.
The soldier and the sailor have, of course,
long been stock figures. Yet, even in the
sea novels ami the war novels the stories
wen .Menial. They dealt with the
humors and the romance of their sub
jects, but not with the real life of the
soldier and the sailor. Hero is Kipling's
originalityâ he has tried not to study
from without, but to create from within.
His method is often tediously technical,
his art rough, but his conception is a high
and will be a fruitful one. For the pres
ent his Influence upon most who have ta
ken suggestions from him has been In
many ways injurious. He encourages a
brutal realism of style and has helped to
confirm the delusion that the raw materi
al of a story \a a story. In the ideal talo
of occupation, character and action will
be colored through and through by the
occupation chosen, but the work will
never lose tlie s. tise of normal human life
and the true dignity of art. The circum
stances of the tale will be those of the
railroad, the lumber camp, the telegraph
company: the human nature will be uni
versal human nature displaying itself in
those circumstances.
In the three books, the names of which
are mentioned, each author has had a
different view of the problem of the rail
road story. Mr. Hill, In "Stories of the

In February added to our list o.f dead and
was noted for the gallant stand made by
the volunteers under 'a most galling fire.
The Boers crept up and captured an am
bulance which a native driver had fool
ishly driven into the tiring line. They
were most anxious to get a gun and ai
most succeeded, but the carbineers rode
in among them and drove them back, un
til the gun could be changed in position,
when it spoke for itself. We lost about
40 horses and 30 men killed and wounded,
the colonel and myself being among the
latter.
This was the last big fight. On the one
hundred and third day of the investment
a mounted man bearing a flag of truce
was reported by our yldettes. He brought
the news of Laings Neck and the still sad
der news of peace. It was to us a peace
that passed all comprehension. We could
scarcely believe that our blood had been
spilt so utterly in vain.

Captain Brady's "Tales of the Tele

author ha* really understood what he
undertook to do. Here the situations
grow out of the natural circumstances of
a telegrapher's occupation. No one but
a telegrapher could havo been placed as
his characters are; no one but a telegra
pher would have thought, acted an'i joked
like them. And yet they are n..t tele
graphic machines or oddities, but men,
most remarkably like you." Their lan

bore or puzzle thÂ« reader. In lest and
tragedy, in heroism and tenderness, these
little stories ere alive and true.
Captain Brady's weakness la a neglect

had particular reasons for not wishing to

solemnly promised that there should be

Jt has been said that that the feud com
menced when the first Hatflelda and Mc-
( 'oys were born, but the first time it ap
pears in authentic history was when citi-
Eens of Pike County, in the eastern part
of Kentucky, asked the Governor of the
State to provide them with arms and am
munition with which they might defend
themselves from an expected attack upon
the various members and friends of the
McCoy family, which was to be made by
an armed force consisting of nearly 100
of the Hatfleld family and adherents, who
were coming from West Virginia under
the leadership of "Devil" Anse Hatileld
and Cap Hatfield.
This contemplated expedition of the
Hatflelds lacked only Government sanc
tion to give it the title of war, for there
were as many men and as much method
in their preparations as In many of the
Government's military exploits during the
early history of our country.
It was the culmination of an election
fight that took place in-Pike County in
18S2, when a McCoy shot a Hatfleld, but
even back of this there seemed to be
faint shadows of beautiful faces and bold
hearts that loved not wisely, for like all
of the sons of Mars they were no lag
gards in love.
Law was laxly administered in that wild
mountain region, where the moonshiner
defies even the Government's most wily
secret service men and the power of the
military combined, so the Hatflelds, in
order to prevent any miscarriage of Jus
tice and also to give a salutary warning
to any other men who might be Inclined
to send bullets trespassing within their
anatomies, captured four members of
the McCoy family who had been con
o^rri'd in the disturbance and forcibly
carried them as prisoners to West Vir
ginia. With the prisoners once in their
power, however, it seemed to them that
to execute them in West Virginia was a
sort of "killing sheep too near home."
Besides the laws of West Virginia were
more actively enforced. So by secret
mountain trails and through wild forest
paths the unhappy prisoners were re
turned to their native State and shot by
their captors.
The Governor of Kentucky thereupon
made a requisition on the Governor of
West Virginia for some Hatfleldp. The
"West Virginia Governor was evidently
well acquainted with his citizens, and not
desiring to suddenly leave his office va
cant, firmly but politely refused the
request. This unusual proceeding caused
a storm of popular feeling. Large re
wards were offered for the Hatfields, and
the Sheriff of Pike County finally ex
tended his strong arm and his Jurisdic
tion Into the State of West Virginia until
It embraced three Hatflelds.
The Hatflelds now considered that not
only their own honor and feelings were
outraged, but also that their State had
been Insulted.
Another Hatfleld foray was organized
to raid the McCoy home In Pike County.
Again the Hatflelds crossed the border
and succeeded in attacking and burning
the McCoy house and killing while con
fined in the burning houÃe McCoy's wife,
daughter and son.
The elder McCoy escaped, persuaded
thirty of his relatives and friends to join
him, Invaded Logan County, West Vir
ginia, killed two Hatflelds and captured
six, whom they took back with them
and turned over to the authorities of
Pike County.
It was now the turn of the West Vir
ginia Governor to plead for the return
of his citizens, but the Governor of
Kentucky not only refused but under
the authority vested In him by law for
the suppression of crime offered a reward
of $5000 apiece for each and every one of
the West Virginia Hatflelds who had
been engaged in trespasses on Kentucky
soil.
The size of this reward made the Hat
fields much-sought-after people, and, de
siring to be somewhat more retiring and
exclusive than formerly, like all who at
tain prominence, they withdrew them
THE SUNDAY CALL.
selves from active circulation In society.
In order to secure their privacy they
commenced the construction of an Im
pregnable stone fortress on the top of a
thin cliff or wall of rock known as
"Devils Backbone," that Jutted out Into
the valley of the Tug River above Hun
tlngton, W. Va. Here for seven years
they defied law or McCoys to take them.
Tho fortress was entirely of stone, even
the roof being of that material.
It may seem strange that men could
exist practically In a state of Blege dur
ing that time, but It must be remembered
that the friends and neighbors do not
forget them, for there Is always some
thing attractive In assisting fugitives, and
again there are many ways of profitable
action open to those who have succeeded
in placing themselves seourely beyond the
reach of the law.
But confinement and lack of exercise
finally told upon the Hatflelds and they
longed for something more than a mere
defensive existence.
In November, 1896, "Old Cap" Hatfield
went down to Matewan to vote. Not that
he cared particularly, but there is no
nicer place to look for trouble than
around the polls. It is a tradition of the
race that leaders should be chosen by
force and the old spirit still feebly shows
when election day comes around.
It was not long before he was In a Oia
pute with Hutchinson, one of the men
whose family he had broken up in former
years, and who was a member of the Mo-
Coy side of the feud.
Hatfield had .0 flee for hla life, pursued
by a nephew of Hutchinson, who fired at
him repeatedly until "Cap" Hatfleld
turned and with his practiced aim
dropped the young man in his tracks.
The whole of Mlngo County was now
stirred as no war had ever excited it be
fore. Hatfield and twenty of his feudlsts
retired to their fort on Tug River and
one hundred more of his adherents pre
pared to go to the assistance of the
stronghold on the Devils Backbone to
prevent the arrest of Hatfleld.
Something had to be done by the legal
authorities if the power of the legal gov
ment was to be maintained. ThÂ«" fort
could not be taken, for it was only to be
reached by dizzy climbing single file. Ar
tillery could not be brought in to those
wild cliffs, so the Sheriff finally deter
mined on blowing up the whole promon
tory with nitro-glycerin. Tons of the ex
plosive were piled at Its base in a spot
sheltered by overhanging rocks from the
fire of the fort. The Blow match that was
to fire the mine was necessarily very long
In order to enable the Sheriff and his at
tacking forces to retire to a safe distance.
After lighting it, in their haste to get
away before the mountain fell, they ex
posed themselves to view of the Hat
fields and three of the posse were shot.
The besieged force now looked for the
cause of the ; close approach of â  the in
truders. They saw the smoke from the
burning fuses, recognized the peculiar
tarry sulphurous smell and knew at once
that some sort of an explosion was in
store for them, and that instant escape
only might save their lives. The re
mainder of the Sheriff's posse, having by
this time placed themselves in ambush,
began with their rifles to pick off the
Hatflelds : as â  they clambered in wild
frenzy down the cliff trail. Sure death
awaited every onÂ©, so they determined
to await the uncertain, rather than take
the certain death, and returned to the
top of the promontory to hurl vast
stones below in vain attempts to strike
and extinguish the torturingly slow fuses
that sputtered out their dense folds of
smoke.
Then came a burst of thunder sound,
the air was filled with rocks, trees and
blinding dust that filled the valley like a
fog. Before it had cleared away and
while the Sheriff was still looking for his
game, a rifle shot was heard up the val
ley and another, of the posse fell. That
was Hatfleld's farewell to the Sheriff.
The Invested forces had been missed by
the force of the explosion and the dust
of the explosion that was to have been
his death concealed his escape until safe
on the mountain above.
Hatfields and McCoys and their active
partisans were now scattered far and
wide, always shooting on sight, usually
killing and seldom suffering any penalty.
About six months after the destruction
of the fortress, Johnson Hatfield planned
a grand coup, by which the McCoys were
nearly exterminated. New Year's eve he
fired a McCoy house. Hatfields had been
posted all about the place. The McCoys,
not suspecting the cause of the fire, were
endeavoring to pack up and save some of
their possessions.
Beautiful Alifair McCoy ran out of the
house followed by her brother. Shots
were fired. He fell, and as she stooped
to lift him Johnson Hatfleld shot her
frail body through and through. The
rage of McCoy made him like a demon,
and in his fury the Hatfields, superior in
numbers, were routed with â¢ loss. The
trial of Johnson Hatfield did not occur
until the beginning of this year, and the
population of Prestonburg trembled at
the assemblage of Hatfields, who were
called out by their leaders but kept â¢in
submission by officers of the law.
For the present the feud is quiescent in
the East. The stone fort is destroyed
and the bodies of its defenders carry
many bullets that pain and call forth
curses as the moonshiner toils up stony
mountain trails. The McCoys sÂ«ek in
far away lands to live in peace and es
cape the bloody death that waits them,
â  but now under California's bright sun
and over her summer parched hills the
feudal bullets whistle and sing, 1 for when
the Thirty-first Infantry was discovered
to be smallpox infected and Bent into
quarantine on Angel Island,- the space
became too small to hold the two bellig
erent soldiers, whose traditions did not
allow them within forty miles of each
other. The detention camp at Angel Isl

the two feudatories used to the freedom
of their mountain life, and they met In
a furious quarrel before they had been
long confined and were wit"h difficulty
separated. A solemn warning was given
themâ for the commanders of the regi
ment are mainly West Pointers and the
discipline there is on the whole noticeably
good.
The trouble still smoldered bet-ween
the two men, and one day one of them
fancied that his life was in danger It
he/ did not protect it. With him fore
warned was forearmed indeed. To his
tent he rushed, and with malice afore
thought secured his gun and came out
to fire upon his fellow soldier.
At the first shot lhe victim was struck
in the arm. The second struck him in the
leg and crippled him hopelessly. No
chance for him to win glory now in the
wars. When his regiment sails he must
sadly stay hehind, and with the Thirtv
first that is the saddest thing in life
Once, when they were Kentucky volun
teers at Tampa, orders came for them to
sail. Great was their glee when the
transport steamed away for Cuba But
scarcely had she cleared the land when
after her came a flying arrow of a torpedo
boat to say that it was a mistake, and
that they should return. The rage of tne
regiment could scarcely yield ltseft io
discipline. To fight was their only ambi
tion, and to be pulled back was worse to
them than facing death.
Again, in San Francisco they were or
dered on board the Grant; their bag-gaga
was on board when the smallpox was dis
covered among the men, and away they
went to Camp Detention, at Angel island.
But while they sail away happy and free
to fight, the wounded man and his assail
ant will suffer more in being left behind
than from the wound or the punishment
inflicted for the crime.
But there will be an atonement. When
the snow comes again at the -old Ken
tucky home kind friends will redden It
with the blood of his enemy's family, to
make sorrowing women weep over a ilow
erless mound beneath the silent hemlocks.
So the patient nurses his wounds and bis
wrath.
"Serious but not necessarily fatal" lhÂ«
surgeon said. Not fatal to the wounded
man. But have a care, you innocent chil
dren, clambering on the barnyard gute
back there in old Kentucky. Somewhere,
somewhere there is a bullet, long and slim
like the stub of a lead pencil, and some
day from an ambush will come a nfle
crack and your golden curls will tumble
in the dust, and ere your mother can
wipe the blood from your foaming mouth
and close the whitening eyes her blood
will be mixing with yours in the little
pools In the hollows of the dust, and a
tall, quite serious-faced man will throw
another shell in his rifle, pass his hand

and values. It is said that one happy but

acceptance a fivo-cent nickel, laboring

Forest Fires
Tell
How the
Grim Enemy
May Be
Conquered,
OCTOBER has been a month
of most serious forest fires
for California. With the ex
ceptionally hot weather experienced
all over the State â so warm that even
San Francisco was reduced to the
melting pomt â fires seemed to burst
forth in the wooded localities as if
from spontaneous combustion.
In lie far-distant mountains, with
only the straggling sheepht^kier's hut
or the lone rancher's farm in jeop
ardy, the king of destroyers seems
not so all-powerful, but when he
comes to the forests and glades
wherein nestle the habitations of
thousands and where not only thou
sands of dollars of valuable homes
eeem destined to go up in smoke, but
the probable loss of many lives is
imminent â then is his terrible power
realized.
Mcst forcibly was this broug-ht
to us by the narrow escaps of
Marin County barely a few days ago.
The experience of the Sutro forest
fire on the outskirts of San Francisco
itself could hardly be classed under
the head of the real forest fire, but
that across the bay was entirely dif
ferent. There was no opportunity for
hook and ladder or hos; and engine
or the use of trained men â forest fires
do not run upon that plan â and with
a good start upon the part of grim
old King Fire there was abundant
fuel in sight to have lasted for
months and run the loss into millions
of dollars and many lives.
It certainly seemed that divine
Providence took a hand in send
the rain which checked the flai
and it is also interesting to consider
the f.\ct that many prayers were b?
ir.g offered up at that very time for
just that very thing to occur.
Even the rain would have availed
. however, had it not been for
the determined efforts of the men
under the direction of a fov.- master
minds trained by the experiences of
former fires, for almost impossible as
it may seem this most awful of all
scourges can be controlled and duell

of men if thsy work with understand

"When I arrived at Corte Madera Tues
day afternoon every one there said that
thtre was no danger, and two people who
bad Just been over to Mill Valley said the
fire was out, or nearly s-o, and that it
could not again get beyond control. It
was not more than two hours after this
when the lire had not only got beyond
control, but had burned its way from
nearly sea level to the top of Little Ta
malpais, ]W0 feet in height. Up we had
to go on the run. parking our tools and
iking our way through thick brush un
til we came to an open grass slope. This
was burning furiously, but was quickly
extinguished with redwood limbs, with
which we beat it out. From the edge of
the rasa we followed the fire into the
brush, but the unburned part was so thick
as to be a solid barrier, so we were com
pelled to follow In on thf part where the
lire had already burned and walk over the
smoking embers. This was hot work, but
while we blistered our feet and burned our
hands and faces, there was not the danger
of. roasting alive that there would have
been had we become entangled in the un
burned brush.
"With our shovels we pulled down the
burning brush, beat It out and covered
loose earth over the burning leaves. Often
when we had extinguished a long lino of
fire, the flames in front would work down
hill more rapidly and get away from us,
then work slowly around below the un
burned brush and come rushing up the hill
at -us. Of course it would stop when it
reached the burned part, but it would also
commence to run slowly along the hill
horizontally. Then we would have to rush
down through the smoking stubs of
branches and follow back up the line
again.
"There was probably not more than one
fjuarter of a mile of front left to the lire
when it was determined to make a bold
effort by cutting tnrough the brush low
to stop the whole thing at once, so we be
gan to marshal the available men and set
them to work in some order. Paths were
cut in front of the fire line, over a hun
dred willing hands aiding at the work, and
soon a chain of such clearings was made,
and as the roaring of the flames ncared
us, back fires were started from the paths
and went rushing up the sides of the hill
and met the down coming conflagration.
As the fir"s approached each other the
flames shot and leaped and Jumped at
each other like fire giants In a tussel of
death. And death it was, for neither fire
could cross the other, each having burned
â¢iff all of the combustible material, leav
ing the ground clean. Then the villages
seemed safe.
"Excitable persons who had removed
their belongings commenced to gather
them In. But forest fires are often in
their most dangerous stage when they
look the most harmless. Those who had
fought tire all day had scarcely finished
their suppers when darkness came on and
with it a ruddy glare of light reflecting
from Tamalpais, thrown there from some
unseen core of fir., behind the Little Ta
malpais range. The light grew and finally
the flames again came over the ridge
striking terror to the hearts of those, who
had imagined themselves secure.
"It seemed worse this time than be
fvive, for the flames were In impregnable
brush and the fierce &ale which was
blowing with stunning force was veering
around so as to drive the lire on the
towns. Darkness and impassably . brush
forbade a repetition of the work of the
day, on drove the fire and there was
nothing to bo done to save the town
from destruction. Acre after acre of
timber was being turned to barren waste
every minute and no help for it, when a
phenomenon occurred such as I nave
never before witnessed, rain began to fall
as it appeared out of an almost clear sky,
but after our first surprise was over we
examined the sky more carefully and
discovered a long, thin gauze-liÂ«ce cloud,
so thin that the stars could be seen
through it. yet the rain continued. Now
more and . darker clouds began to
raise and lend their aid to our first friend,
the filmy cloud that had thinned almost
to lmperceptibility. The rain as it in
creased in volume gained over . the fire,
and soon all that was left of two miles of
raging furnace was here and there a
deep red glow that looked like a blowhole

do not consider that there is any danger
to life In any of these fires, and as far
as experience has gone there has been
comparatively little toss on improved
property, such as dwellings.
"Our railroad has had much to do with
increasing the facilities for handling fire,
as it enables us. to land men fresh and

up hill with great rapidity because the

necessary to clear a path along parallel

think that going into a winding canyon
with burning trees falling on all sides
was one of the most ordinary things tnai

"and did not come out until the fire was

down through the thick red-woods, some
one set a back fire below him and he came

for my seeing it and sending a man up
on the hill to give him warning. Even
then he had to fight his way down

to walk through even when the brush

Â£""|^HERE !s a tale flitting over our land
I to the effect that love In a cottage is
I the only kind of love we have left.

I People are saying that the little
jl blind god squirms uncomfortably
when he is Introduced to tlmbales and
truflles, and that he never feels thorough
ly at homo except upon a diet of bread
and cheese and kisses. ' Have they for
gotten the romance of Prince Bernadotte,
who married against his father's wish
and thereby lost a kingdom? And of Mat
thew Borden, the Yale millionaire, who
took his girl wife from a life of poverty?
And the Yon Hatzfeldt story, and the
Hope story, and all the rest of them?
The romance of Miss Helen Moulton and
her Count resulted in one of the earliest of
our international marriages. It was in
1563 that the American girl was traveling
In Paris and met Count Paul yon Hatz
feldt. She was tall and dark-eyed and
olever, which inspired admiration, but
Count Paul did not stop at admiration.
They were both young and the upshot of
tlie matter was that they were man
the Bame year and Miss Helen Mouiton
became a Countess.
Eleven yc-ars later society was startled
at hearing of the same couple's divorce.
Parisian and Parisian visitors of 'OX from
all over Europe and the United States
could look back upon one of the most bril
liant weddings mat had ever taken place
at the French capital, and this rift in mo
lute was as ironical a matter as tha rest
of life is. Society remembered that it hod
paid confidently; "A love match-'J There
had been all tho orange blossoms and
white roses and Mendelssohn music and
"Worth gowns of the conventional wed
ding, but besides and above all these were
two really In love young people. So when
the news of 1574 came it deserved au
arched brow of surprise.
Back to American came the Count-less
Countess, bringing with her three little
Yon Hatzfeldts, whose duty was to for
get Europe and papa as fast as possible.
They made American mud pies and were
taught to like, only American dulls, and
they must needs ride. American hobby
horses. They learned their lesson like <ln
tiful children and they did not anticipate
mamma's renewed romance.
It did not come until 1559. Then she vis
it wi Europe again. ... .
It was at Baden Baden this time that
she met Count yon Hatzfeldt. Once more
he thought tier beautiful and ever She
discovered that she had grown tired of be
ing tired or' him. In September of the
Fame year society had still more to talk
about, when the wedding took place. Some
of the same friends who had heard the
long ago ceremony at Paris were at Baden
In ! i3 to see the same couple united again.
And so far there has been nothing but
harmony in the union, and the three little
Yon Hatzfeldts are quite as well content
with London life as with American.
Though they are not very little any more,
by the way, but quite eld enough to ap
preciate that it is a very proud thing to
nave a father who is German Embassador
to the Court of St. James.
There is a Swedish love story being
lived even now that runs something In
this wise. Once upon a time a little
Swedish maiden was made attendant of
the Queen. The girl was of good family,
but not nnble. She was patient in duty
end reserved 'n manner, and it may have
been her patience ar.d reserve that made
her charming, but more likely it was her
face, which was pretty in Its chilly north
ern way. ' There is no touch of warmth
In the Swedish type of beauty, but men
fall in love with it nil the same. And in
this romance, pretty soon along came the

have been lately photographed together
with a live-happy-ever-atier expression.
Balfour Kerr, the artist, met Miss Sigs
bee while she was studying art abroad.
She is the daughter of the famous Maine
captain. Her talent for painting and the
fact that she is her father's daughter both
distinguish her. But neither of these
counted for half as much to Mr, Kerr as
the fact that he was in love with her. lie
has nothing but his brush to depend upon
for a living, but he is going to keep that
brush very busy for the sake of the bride
he has won.
Miss Mary Ellen Slgsbee knew well
enough that her father would protest, if
nothing more, in case she confided her
love affair to him, so she made sure of
consent by marrying first and telling af
terward. The genial captain was wise
enough to be good-natured over what
could not be helped, and Mr. and Mrs.
Kerr are a happy couple.
The love story of Carlotta has gone into
the making of history.
She was a lonely little Belgian Princess
at first, a Princess In one of the most sol
emn courts of all Europe. She was al
lowed but four balls a year, and at those
she must dance with none but her broth
ers. The best of brothers grow stale at
times. No wonder that when handsome,
brave young Maximilian came to court
she found in him a new charm.
They were married and went to Italy for
their honeymoon. It is one of the most
famous of all the world's honeymoons. It
lasted on and on through long blue Italian
days, and it was without selfishness. Both
of the lovers went abroad doing good to
the poor and needy. All Italy was their
friend. The happy time lingered until Na
poleon's message came.
Then the Mexican colors went up above
the honeymoon castle of Minima r.
The King and Queen were sad In parting
from their beloved home, but they did not
realize that the parting was forever. They
looked back upon the towers, and then the
sight faded. It was ho! for the new land!
They entered upon the life and work
hopefully, bravely. But It was no use to
cling to courage. Troubles deepened and
at last came strife.
Carlotta put her shoulder under the
burden. She went back to Europe to
plead for her husband.
She. begged help, of Napoleon. She
pleaded in all the courts of Europe. . No
body listened.
Love would face anything, but the flesh
was weak. Health and nerves gave out.
She does not know that Maximilian lost
his life as bravely as he had lived it. She
Is the Mad Queen who understands noth
ing except that her room is very small
and holds one checked on every side, and
that he does. not come; he never comes.
In her padded chamber she awaits him,
day In and day out, and the years are
rung out in the waiting.
While the old Queen's sad story is being
lived out in Belgium, a little neighbor

own discovery. Eighteen-year-old Wil

The greatest of all

suela Vanderbilt, whose
$10,000,000 were united
with one of the longest and
oldest titles of all the British
nobility. Consuela / was so

V build up a pretty little romance about
' their marriage in spite of the worldly
wise cynics. . They are living happily in
Blenheim castle, the old family home, near
London. The course of true love has run
smooth from beginning to end in 'his
pretty heiress' cafe, for parental consent
smiled upon a happy union. The Vander

making a fairer home for a happy family.

tome to try New York gayety. To the
London suitor she has been as cold as she
Is beautiful. It is a matter of conjecture
whether any American can move her.
There is no doubt but some of our young
men will try.
The Russian Prince, Engalitcheff, found
his affinity in Chicago. She was Miss
Evelyn Partridge, an heiress. The Prince
had it ft his St. Petersburg home and was
on a tour around the world. Everything
went smoothly as far as Chicago; then a
chubby little fellow, armed with a bow
and arrow, confronted him and blocked
his path. He found it impossible to get
past love.
Miss Partridge became a Princess last
October. She wiil accompany her husband
soon to his Russian home. The Prince
says that his chief regret in returning is
that he will not have such good roads for
wheeling as in Chicago, where he learned
the use of the bicycle under the guidance

It is more than three years since the
marriage of Miss Grace Wilson gave so
ciety a fruitful topic of conversation. The
story of her marriage with Cornelius
Vanderbilt Jr. is another story of sac
rifice
Young Vanderbilt was the oldest heir to
the great Vanderbilt fortune. He was to
inherit $100,000,000 and to have charge or
the family estate. â¢ ,'- ; Â
But his father wanted to choose a wlra
for him. He was very much displeased
when Cornelius, then only out of college,
chose for himself. ; >
He loved and was loved by Miss Grace
Wilson. Why it was that his father op
posed the match was never known, to the
public at least. The only objection ever
made known was that the young lady was
almost 30 and her lover barely 21. When,
Mr. Vanderbiit Sr. mentioned this fact
young Cornelius replied that. age didn't
count.
She had all the wealth and position that
Mr. Vanderbilt might have been expected
to ask, but for some reason he took a
violent dislike to one of the most sunshiny
little persons that ever graced New York
society. He forbade the marriage on the
penalty of disinheritance. Young Corne
lius persisted and had his way.
And they are very happy. The father
died without forgiving his son, and with
never a word of kindness for her who
would have been a loving daughter. They
have large means from the families of
both, but the great fortune was sacrificed.
And it was done with full knowledge.
Another of the Wilson sisters was
married before, and she transferred her
romance to England. She loved and
married the Hon. Henry Herbert, and by
so doing made the Earl of Pembroke her
brother-in-law. She lives In a beautiful
English country place, quaint and home

love made the match.

of literature, much of It trivial and evan-(

form a very important link in the history (,
of those countries, and that with the sin-^
fie exception of coins and medals nothing '
rdthln the reach of every one so well il-(
lustrates the civil and political changes of
government. s
It may not be known to all readers of (
â The Call that the first postage stamps ]
were designed and used in England so re-(
cently as 1840. Before that time letters
were carried by the Postofflce Department, %
thÂ» fee for which was collected from tht (
(person to whom they were delivered, vary- '-
ing from 10 to 25 cents, though the sender '
couM prepay if ho chose, and the letter^
* r as then marked "paid," with the amount (
co received. About 18S7 Sir Rowland Hill /
gave the question of cheaper postage and
more prompt conveyance of the mails
close study. *
He believed by exacting prepayment on (
all letters the department would lose no /
fees, as was the case at that time, be- V
rause from the inefficiency of the service.
many letters were lost, and some personsi
refused to receive and pay the sum de-*
mar.ded. He therefore formulated a
scheme for a uniform rate of one penny
on all letters of a half-ounce or less, to
be prepaid in all cases. He believed that
the sma'ler fee would encourage the more
frequent use of the mails, and as the
losses would be practically eliminated,
the department would be able to give a
prompter service for the smaller sum.
The adoption of Sir Rowland Hill's plan
In 1840, its successful inauguration nnd
â¢rrowth since and the inestimable vaiue
to society and commerce fire matters of
history. To-day the Postofflce Depart
ment Is the most important, branch of the
public service in all civilized nations, and
its operations have been simplified to a
great degree by the Introduction of post
age stamps.
Is it any wonder then that the collec
tlon, preservation and study of these
little labels should have attracted young
and old many years ago? The intimate
aÃsoclation of stamps with letters, par-
ticularly letters from foreign countries
and llttle-heard-of places, Is a strong
factor In developing the collecting in-
stlnct. Except widely traveled persons,
THE ENORMUS COST OF YACHTING.
, > r TZ7 lE"W1 E"W branches of sport yield less In
â JT comparison with the sums lavished
on them than yachting, which of ne
cessity Is a monopoly of men with well-
Mined purses. The Initial cost of a yacht
''may range from $500 to $500,000, and the
Aannual outlay from $500 to $50,000.
f The man who buys a *80-ton yacht for
purposes alone, and without any
(of the added cost of racing:, must expect
'-'her tn cost him $2500 a year. For a 100-ton
\vacht he will have to disburse from $3600
/"to $5000 a year, without counting: depre
ciation or the interest on the $10,000 or
v 515,000 he has sunk in her purchase.
I When a man aspires to the luxury of a
"steam yacht of hundreds of tons he ought
to have the deep purse of a millionaire,
'â for he may well spend on his hobby the
(annual income of a Cabinet Minister of
the first rank; while the Interest alone on
A the money his Boating palace represents
would pay the annual stipend of a bishop.
\ These estimates, based on the evidence
!' an expert, are for pleasure yachts
)only, as distinguished from racing yachts;
for the owner of ;i racer must expect to
/add materially both to original outlay

It is estimated that the cost of building

BIG PRICES PAID FOR STAMPS.
"j-UE prince of stamp collectors, sayÃ
t! â¢ London Mail, is undoubtedly a
I Monsieur Ferrari of Paris. Virtually
priceless are the stamp collections
of this gentleman, and his devotion
to the hubby may be gauged
from the fact that he keeps
three s-.<rotaries especially to look
after the precious bits of colored paper,
are arranged and catalogued in lux
urious libraries.
M Ferrari possesses no fewer than eight
specimens of the famous â "Postofflce Mau
ritius," the rarest stamp in the world, of
which only fourteen copies are known to
exist. The anna: value of this stamp â

or those enraged In trade with the four
Quarters of the globe, most people look
upon a letter from a foreign country as
a curloalty, and the less the country Is
known or the more remote Its location
the greater Interest attaches. It is then
the most natural thing for the one re-
calving It to carefully preserve it, and
for this season alone cannot be much less
than $1,000,000.
The thirty-nine sailors on the Columbia
will receive $35 a month; so that for a
season of five months their wages alone
will absorb $6825. Their food will bring
this sum to at least $10,000, and to this
total for wages and food must be added
the skipper's salary of $4000.
These items, although they amount to
nearly $15,000, only represent a part of the
season's expenses. At least once a week
the yacht will have to be taken out of the
water to have her bottom polished. The
manganese bronze of which her hull Is
built accumulates seaweed rapidly and
this and all other accretions must be
cleared away at short intervals If her
speed is not to suffer.
To say that the Columbia will cost her
owner $25,000 for the season's racing is
probably an underestimate, while the cost
of racing the Shamrock will be greater.
If the Shamrock is successful in taking
back the cup to England the trophy will
cost her generous owner no less than
80 in addition t r > all other normal ex
penditure, for this Is the sum which will
be required to pay every member of the
winning crew the promised $5 a week for
life.
To race a yacht like the Britannia, the
face value â from the fact that it
bears the words "postoffice" instead of
the regulation "post, paid." It was issued
in 1547, and is bo very highly prized that
not long ago a wildly enthusiastic collec
tor advertised that he was willing to cor
respond, with a view to matrimony, with
a lady possessing a copy of "Postoglce
Mauritius, 1847."
The two-penny blue "post paid" Mauri
tius is another very valuable stamp, and
at an auction a copy of it actually realized
$700â the highest price ever paid for a
stamp sold in this way. This particular
specimen was unused, but even a canceled
copy has been sold for $460.
As a rule. African stamps seem to beat
the record for big prices. For example,
a one penny Capo of Good Hope has re
other example* which chance may throw
his way. until by comparison an Interest
Is awakened in the stamps of all coun
tries.
Stamp collecting, or, as Its more ad
vanoed devotees call It, "philately," Is
far more than a fad or craze. The fact
that many persons have pursued it for
Meteor or the Rainbow for a single sca-y
son cannot cost less than $15,000. apart >
from accidents and depreciation, while IfV
we consider the short racing life of one/
of ihese "greyhounds" and distribute h;r\
original cost over the few years of hero
life the annual price paid for the brief)
luxury of owning her must be Increased^
by many thousands a year. Â»
Certainly it is safe to say that no many
should think of owning a racing yacht of/
this class who is not prepared to spend y
$23,000 to $30,000 a year for the indulgence./
Even the gift of a $500 prize is largely')
removed by the extra expenses of vacingv
and winning. It is usual for the owner of)
a winning: yacht to pay her crew $5 each,*
In addition to their wages. On a boat like'
the Britannia this liberality would entail v ,
an extra cost of nearly $200 for the day.',,
To this item in the balance sheet must be/
added $50 gratuity for the skipper and a y
smaller fee for the pilot, together with/
another 525 for the provisions and bever- ,
ages. Thus, acrainst the prize of $500 musty
be set an additional charge for the day
of about $300. " v

$260 and a nine penny Natal has changed
hands at $130. A Cingalese four penny rose,
unused, was sold By our Informant for
$650 not long ago, while a sheet of twelve
West Indian six penny stamps went for
*T75, this being a record price.
Five hundred dollars apiece has been
realized at auction for a nve-cent Ameri
can "Brattleboro" stamp and a nine

green paper instead of on the official pink.
But some idea of the enormous trado

from the statement that the total sum

periods varying from ten to thirty years,
during which time they have carefully
noted the various postal and political
changes, proves its permanent Interest
and value to them as a study. The accu
mulation of a collection has kept them In
touch with current events, while their ap
preciation of art has been fostered, and
the pleasure of collecting has been one of
'their chief enjoyments. Every stamp or
1 series of stamps is associated in their
| minds with some important group of
events, and thus they speak to them from
i the pages of their albums.
Cultured people are naturally collectors
>â not in the sense of mere gatherers of
objects for their Intrinsic value, but
rather of articles which appeal to their
, sense of the beautiful, as pictures or stat
uary; or those which appeal to their ln
(telligence, as books. Postage stamps In
a moderate way appeal to both the lntel
) ligence and the imagination. The num
ber of persons who devote time and
) thought to their accumulation and study
vis already very large and constantly in
' creasing. In every large city and in
\many small towns there are persons who
have no other business than buying and
) selling stamps.
During the season from ten to thirty
) auction sales are held In New York, vary
ing in net proceeds from a thousand to
five thousand dollars. Their value as
) commodities is as well fixed and vary as
, little from year to year as books, pic
tures or coins. While the element of
y speculation and inflation sometimes ap
' pears, the event is never attended with a
\ complete slump in prices. Better class
stamps must always maintain their value
>for the very reason that through fire
water or other disintegrating influences
\ their number continually grows less, while
' the army of collectors who wish to pos
sess them is ever increasing.
' San Francisco has a society, known as
Kthe Pacilic Philatelic Society composed
/of a considerable number of enthusiastio
â¢ philatelists, and it has held regular
'monthly meetings for the past fifteen
years. It maintains a clubroom, where
its members meet, and a library of sev
eral hundred volumes of books and peri
odicals devoted exclusively to their pur
suit may be found.
To them stamp collecting Is not an Idle
craze, but a serious study, which demands
from them their best thought. At its
meetings papers are frequently read
which could not fail to interest any one
who gives a thought to current events.
New Issues are shown and discussed, new
facts about old issues may be brought up,
and everything pertaining to thÂ« postal
service is legitimate matter for notice.
Not alone the changes of the workings
of the Postofflce Department in the new
possessions of the United Statesâ Porto
Rico, the Philippine Inlands Guam and
the protectorate over Cubaâ but the con
stant changes in the continents of the old

IN San Francisco there lives and
works a man who by his own Individ

of their respective families over 1000
women and girls, and thus given them
a chance to tie the broken threads â
broken by accident, by mistake or by
sheer recklessnessâ and go on weaving
smoothly ever after, if they so choose, on
the loom of life*.
Detective Abraham Anthony of the San
Francisco Police Department Is the man
â who has dona this, and because of his ex
ploits in this particular line he Is known
to his brother officials in every large city
of the United States as the most success
ful "woman hunter" of our Western
world. For nearly nineteen years Detect
ive Anthony has devoted himself to the
task of looking- up feminine truants, who,
by their own volition or by some trick of
circumstance, have become lost to the
world that knew them before the black
curtain of mystery fell between them and
their former surroundings.
Detective Bainbridge says that " 'Tony,' 1
as the "woman hunter" is affectionately
called by his comrades, with all of whom
he Is a great favorite, is a "miracle" in
his own peculiar way.
"Tony can find and dig out of hiding a
girl or a woman as surely and almost ns
readily as the German truffle hounds can
unearth those epicurean treasures." Mr.
Eainbridge declares, "for if you put him
on the track of one he will find her or die
trying. It's a wonder how he does '. but
he has never been known to fail yet."
He doesn't look in the least like a
"sleuth," this quiet, slow-moving, slow
speaking 1 man,' who receives 'you In his
shirt sleeves when he is enjoying a restful
hour In his home, and in a comfortably
creased business suit when at "the of
fice." With his hat on. Tony appears very
much like a well-to-do rancher, but no
confidence man would ever try to "rope
him In" after one glance at the sharply
6hrewd. blue-gray eyes, which look out at
the world so keenly from under his well
marked eyebrows. For the rest, he has a
rather wide face, with high cheek bones,
a long, thin but by no means prominent
nose, a determined, narrow-lipped mouth,
a decidedly obstinate chin and .1 short but
Belf-assertive gray-blond mustache. It 19

normal, development of his forehead, and,
in fact, the entire cerebrum, which to a
believer in phrenology would perfectly ac
count for the "miracle" of his peculiar
mental capabilities. His speech is diver
sified by lingual reminiscences of Prussia
still, though he has been thirty-five years
in this country, spending thirty of those
years as a resident of San Francisco, and
nearly four of them - only a boy he was
thenâ in fighting gallantly for the Union,
which he had learned to love even In far
off Nakal, his birthplace.
It is difficult, Indeed, well nigh impos-
Bible, to persuade Anthony to talk of his
exploits, but there Is a certain over
grown, black-bound volume In which all
these things have hern made matters of
record, and here la found full substantia
tion of all the stories which his admiring
fellows tell of him.
And what heart-breaking stories they all
are, too, considered quite apart from De
tective Anthony's share in them! They
are, every one of them, histories of suffer
ing, wrong or misdoing: of foolishness
which Is wicked, or wickedness which is
foolish. And the moral, self-evident, if
never openly expressed, is the largest part
of them; but it will never, while great

Do you realize how many schoolgirls
have, during the past nineteen years, left
happy homes without warning or reason,
moved by childish whim orâ oh, the pity

driven to disgrace because their homes
were not happy? Do you ever think how
many wives desert their husbands each
year, and why? And what become* of
those to whom no kindly friend like De
tective Anthony appears, booing a mes
sage of forgiveness and hope? If you arÂ«
unaware of, or indifferent to, these
things this book of Detective Anthony's
will wake you to a sense of life's realities,

heart, I pray you do not seek to read it,

after her and bring her back. I remem
ber that the saucy, little thing kissed, her
hand to me in the courtroom when her
mother took her away," and he laughed
outright at the recollection.
"One of the oddest cases that I ever
knew of," he goes on, "was that of a
young girl find her stepmother who ran
away together from an almost palatial
home in Sacramento. The head of the
house was a rather stern man of 70 years
and his ideas of 'home rule' seemed very
arbitrary to his wife and child, who came
here and 'set up housekeeping 1 for them
selves, but were glad enough to return
when I found them, for their money was
giving out and neither of them knew how
to earn more."
" 'What was the queerest case I ever
knew of?' "âa brief season of retrospec
tion follows this question. "Well, that
one of Ella Wilson of Los Gatos lias
never been really explained. That girl
was lost for two weeks, and when she
wrs dug up in a Montgomery street lodg
ing house she was a sight to behold. She
had eaten and drank absolutely nothing
for five days and nights, although she
had plenty of money and a quantity of
valuable jewelry with her. She looked
like a living skeleton, and she claimed
that she had left her home- and come to
this city under the hypnotic influence of
a woman in Lob Gatos, whose name she
refused to tell, and that she had been
perfectly unconscious of her actions or
surroundings until just before htr restor
ation to home and friends. She had been
quite alone all of the time and no harm
came to her out of the affair except a
brief illness due to her self-imposed star
vation."
Will he tell me of some of the feminine
criminals whom he has captured or helped
to capture?
"The most remarkable one in the line of
thievery," he answers, "was the original
'Woman in Black,' who, ten years ago,
stole over $20,000 worth of jewelry and
other valuables here in fcan Francisco,
after serving a sentence in Sing Sing for
stealing $18,000 in government bonds from
a room in the St. Nicholas Hotel- in New
York city. Then there were the 'Noodle
Girls,' and Eva Doherty, known a year or
so ago as the 'toughest child in the city.*
"But the girl who has given me the most
trouble in that way is Annie Meyers, a
German girl, who for more than fifteen
years has been a constant source of an
noyance to the police. Annie began to
steal when she was 8 years old, her first
big exploit being to clear out all the
smaller treasures of her own home and
distribute them among her playmates. I
have arrested this girl over and over, and
as her favorite method of procedure is to
answer advertisements for domesticÃ and

mure and acquisitive, for only last year
when I arrested her down on Sixth street
she Jumped over the railing of a veranda
twenty-live feet from the ground and then,
climbed an eight-foot fence and ran sever
al blocks to get away from me."
"Did you jump after her?"
The detective shakes his head emphat
ically. "No. but I caught her all the
same. I've been pretty near getting killed,
though, several times since I went into
this work, the first time not quite two
months after getting my appointment.
John R. Samuels, then Deputy Sheriff of
Colusa County, tried to shoot me then,
and came very near doing it, too, but I
didn't really blame him much under tha
circumstances. You see, he sent his wlfa
here for a six months' visit for her health,
and she got in with a tough lot and went
to the bad. so that she was soon known a3
'drunken Frankie' all over the Barbary>
Coast. He didn't know a word of it, of
course, but when he came down to see her
she was in a snarl about a stolen cloak,
and when he came to me about it I, not
knowing that he was her husband, advised
him not to mix up with the woman at allj
because of her reputation, and he tried to'
kill me right there. It was a hard deal',
for the man all around, and I always felt |
sorry for him.
"Three years ago Kate Flood was nearly j
the death of me, too. I arrested her and
she begged so hard not to go up to the
City Hall in the patrol wagon that I took
her on a car instead, and Just as we got
to Leavenworth street slÂ»e Jumped off and
pulled me after her when I hung on to her
dress. We both fell flat, and I lay right
in front of another car and thought I was
a dead man for a minute, but I managed
to get out of the way just in time, and
keep my prisoner, too.
"Now, as to what makes so many run
away from homeâ sometimes ifs one thing
and sometimes it's another.
"Most people are too easy and careless
with their girls and let them run around
too much with other girls without any
older person to look after them. And then,

IT is Chambers place to those of the

It was the jaxgling bell of No. l that I
rangâ an old-fashioned pull-bell, like a
white doorknob. My formula was as fol
lows: "Find Mrs. Chambers, whose hus
hand was a multi-millionaire of pioneer
days She livs In poverty with two im
becile children." It was not a pretty form
ula.

that face upon the street squint their cur
tains tight against curiosity; which is
probably an idle thing to do, for curiosity

rooms and a porch, kitchen, highly col
ored kitten chasing a bail on the front

In the bedrooms, greasy table and rusty
Btove in the kitchen."
Then the door was opened and my pre
eumptions scampered any way they
might, not to be seen.
For from the sight of nil that is bleak
and brown and commonplace without, I
stepped into the most ivmarkable parlor â¢
that many and devious paths have ever
led me Into. Here Is luxury in the midst
of poverty, elegance where you would ex
pert elegance to lift disdainful skirts and
pick a hurried way past.
From the decaying wreck of a fortune
Mrs. Chambers has saved the gilt-mount
ed mirrors that tower to the celling of
their tiny quarters. The rugs have
etretched across the floors of a great
house. The polished walnut piano was a
grand Instrument In the days when two
attached candlos preceded piano lamps,
â end its soul Is the tinkling little soul that
<mcc responded to the notes of "Ben
Bolt" or "The Farmer's Life."
I never saw any woman live through
euch want as Mrs. Chambers has lived
-through and still cling to these beautiful
luxuries. But, then, I never saw any
"Woman like Mrs. Chambers.
I found her courteous with a fine cour
tesy and reserved with a fine reserve.
"Will you tell me something about your
husband and his career?"
"My husband was a pioneer. His pic
ture hangs beside the door."
This with the simplicity of grandeur.
Inquiry shriveled to Impudence. He was
a pioneer. There was his picture. Fur
ther than this what was there that con
cerned the great hulking, brutal world
that looks for a second, then laughs
coarsely and forgets?
It was like surgery to go on. Slowly
at first the story came, then faster, un
til it tumbled forth, a confused heap of
memories and tears and laughs and
dreams. It has taken me half a day's
mental sorting to get it in the least kind
of order, but the hurt of it all was clear
and sharp yesterday and is to-day and
â¢will be to-morrow.
It seems that her mother, Mrs. Wilson,
was a Quaker, and she inherits the
aristocracy of an old New York Dutch
â¢line from her father. So much for her
Btart in life.
She was only a. little girl and her
braids were still long and her frocks
â¢were short when doctrine split the fam
ily. Mr. Wilson had turned Baptist and
Mrs. Wilson had gone to the temper
ance platform as a prologue to the sepa
ration. Then the year of '49 arrived, and
Mrs. Will heard that vice stalked,
lonely, the ramshackle streets of Califor
nia, and she concluded that it would ap
preciate her better than Mr. Wilson did.
Bo she took the Sunday-school books she
had written and the temperance lectures
Bhe had prepared and the little girl, to
â¢whom rhe owed care and love and hap
j)lness, and she departed by the Panama
â route.
When Mrs. Wilson reached San Fran
cisco she found that her Sunday-school
"books and her temperance lectures were
not appreciated. People wanted women
to bake and stew for them, but they had
no time nor appetite for spiritual food.
Mrs. Wilson was grievously J dis
appointed. She had come with the best
of Intentions. People did .not care.
There was no way to be useful.
Bo she died.
This Itft one little girl alone In San
Franciscoâ the Han Francisco of the early
BO's. There happened to her Just
what happen? to story-book little girls:
Bhe fell into the hands of a d^af old rnald.
"Then, oh, my dear, my troubles com
menced In earnest. She kept me like a
prisoner and made me work hard. I
was only 12 years old. I was the most
unhappy child that ever lived."
Following close upon this experience
came a romance. She was a mite of a
thing to have a romance; but she was
motherless, and the same as fatherless,
and so there was nobody to shoo the ro
mance away. The guardian tried to, but
{ailed.
It was during Mrs. 'Wilson's life that a
friend. Mr. James Chambers, had res
cued mother and daughter from a burn-
Ing building. The fire broke out In a
Kearny-street house where the Wilsons
lived, and Mr. Chambers took them to
bis home, n"ar the ferry of these days.
"Was he a wealthy man at that time?"
"Oh, my dear, yes. He and Mr. Sharon
owned most of the water front. He was
very good to us.
"He went to Europe a little while after
thatâ while my mother still lived, you
understandâ and when he left he asked
me what he should send me for a present.
I was wild over my muslo lessons at that
time, so I said I wanted a piano. But
I did not really expect it. I was so sur
prised when It came. It was a thousand
dollar piano, a beautifully toned Instru
ment."
"But why did he not look after you

â¢â lie didâ but wait."
I Btood corrected. lr waa not my turn
tell the story.
"He stayed in Europe a long time and
when h-- i ame back I waa with the deaf
ii<i. He learned where I was and
he came to see me. but she locked me
in a hack room and told him that I had
gone away. Sh.- was bound to keep me.
I heard what went on and I resolved from
that day to find Mr. Chambers and tell
him how 1 was treated.
"I wrote him a letter on a Ion.? ribbon
: he only station, ry I could find.
1 pinned it in the front of my little low
ii. eked ilr'-ss. with the pfn on the out
side. 1 was waiting for a chance to send
it.
"See how things happen. The old maid
wanted a pin and she saw that one on the
front of my dress. She told me to give It
to her, and as I did so the paper slipped
and rustled and poked a corner out. She
was suspicious of the least thing, so she
clutched at the paper and 1 clutched too,
and 1 managed to bite off little bits of Jt
In the struggle. But there was enough
left for her to make out. and when she
knew what I was about she made matters
worse than ever fur me."
Tf I should see the wicked old maid
come upon the stage and happen to want
ft pin at the critical moment, and hap
pen to light upon the critical pin, I should
wax blase and I should snap at the
dramatist for a man of cheap device.
But if I can look into Mrs. Chambers'
wide eyes and doubt, then Is the moon
mnde of gn-. n cheese and the earth as
flat as a dinner plate.
< <:' cours( . he came and took you away
from her?" I pushed on, sniffing a fairy
prince ladder afar.
"No; I ran away instead. I took my
little dresses and the Polly and I escaped.
Then 1 managed to send Mr. Chambers
word, and lie soon took care of me. He
put me with a Mrs. Hates, who kept
house on the hill, and there I lived un
til I was 14 years; old.
"1 was very happy.
"When I was 14 Mr. Chambers and I
were married. He was 4:; years old, and
I only a child, but that never mattered
to me. He was always 1 i V; â¢ â¢ husband and
father both. We were so happy."
I watched my patent leather tip
dawdling with the tiger tall on the floor.
The questions stood abashed. I flirted
limply with the bisque serenader on the
shelf. The woman before me was strug
gling like mad with a jerking lower lip. I
would have slipped thankfully through
any loophole of escape, and the four
winds take the rest of the story.
Then relief came where 1 least looked
fur It. For with the majesty of her race
she drew a tight rein and went on.
"My husband lived almost eighteen
years after our marriage. His wealth,
which was great at the time I married
him. increased through the years, and we
lived in luxury. I had everything I
wanted before 1 had a chance to want it.
"Mr. Chambers owned property every
where and of all kinds. His buildings
were all over San Franciscoâ buildings
that you could not find a stone or a
shingle of now. The rentals from these
amounted to J4SSO a month. His ranch
lands stretched all around. There were
acres and acres in the San Joaquin Val
ley, and at one time the whole of what
was then the San Pablo ranch was his.
"He had mining stocks and water
sharesâ at the time when the water rate
was $30 per month. It was because of
this interest that Mr. Sharon managed
to get my water rate reduced after I was
left destitute.
"Did Mr. Chambers acquire all his
wealth in California?"
"Yes tht whole of It. He came here in
'49 with Mr. Parrottâ John Parrott. He
was without means then.

the fact that Japan is now a great power
that no extraterritorial clause hampers
the exercise of her laws, that her bor
ders are free to the entrance of all foreign
ers, evidences to us that this result is not
an accident but the attainment of a phase
of development which has been steadily
evolving. Japan, half a century ago con
sidered a pagan land, is to-day abreast of
the standard of nationsâ a giant in innate
possibilities, whose reserve power of
valor, intelligence and capability insures
a continuance of growth, presaging that
insidious approximation of relationship
which is of most deep portent to the peo
ples of the West. It means a quickening
and heralds a serious and prolonged ac
tivity on the part of the latter if they are
to successfully maintain existing tenets
and characteristics as the paramount
power, while far reaching influences will
mark the virile activity of Japanese
growth and ambition.
Will the coalition of Orient and Occident
result in a hybrid stock in which racial
characteristics will assume new generali
tiesâa new people unifiedâ or will it be a
coherence in which exists no bond save
that of mere contact â an agreed equality?

The youngest son Is a man of 30. He has

find work now, and so the last resort has
come. Mrs. Chambers is offering her en

thing of great intrinsic value left. It is
the sapphire of her girlish whim, chosen
when she was tired of diamonds. It has
been clung to and cherished and guarded,
and now its day has come.
In all of Mrs. Chambers' remarkable
history there was nothing which im
pressed me so much as the Instinctive
good taste and self-respect which have
led her to make her home what it Is.
The marvelous way in which the dreari
ness of poverty has been transformed Is
the strongest clew to her character that I
caw. The arrangement of furniture, pic
tures, ornaments, is old-fashioned but ex
quisite. The stooping corner of the white
washed back porch has been roofed with
cheap bits of glass by the carpenter's
skill, and it opens from the living room
in the guise of a conservatory, where
flappy-eared begonias grow and where
ferns sprawl in lazy warmth. She herself
Is neatly threadbare. Her face is no lest
than ugly with the scars of worry and
tears. It is the tone of her voice, the
ease of her language and the unconscious

The Correct Rjdflmg Habit.
THIS is the season of the year when
My I.ady goes a horseback-riding
in town. Which Is quite another
and more costly matter than cross
country riding.
tiive a horse of sure foot, a pair of leg
gins, bloomers, short skirt, shirtwaist,
sombrero and you have Mile. Vaquero
complete. She is your true modern Diana
uccoutered for the chase, be it grizzly
bear or jackrabbit. She rides astride,
and you please, takes the fences without
clutching the pommel, or pluckier yet,
does a good fifty miles a day and takes
her meals in the conventional manner on
the morrow.
But Diana of the boulevard and prome
nade, bien! She is another creature. Her
horse is a well groomed animal, small
of ankle and short of tail, with an aristo
cratic tilt of the head. He trots, as a
five-dollar-an-hour equine should trot,
nor shies at an automobile or any other
kind of wheel.
The habit of the city Diana 1* a match
for the steed. It Is horse and hÂ»rsÂ«
which is the better groomed. Good
hostlers seem to be more plentiful In San
Francisco than good hablt-raakerÃ, Judg
ing from the complaints of the fair
equf-strienr.es.
The habit which Mise Margaret DalÂ«
wears in these pictures was made In New
York with the "Lunnon" Beal of approral
and is "awfully good form, don't cher
know." Mies Dale is devoted tÂ« riding
and her faultless habit caused not a email
flutter among the ridere of the Ban Fran
cfpro Club, where the courtesies of the
ring and stable were extended to her
while ?he was tarrying among us.
If you would be absolutely correct in
every" detail, study these photographs and
prepare to wrangle with your tailor
should he suggest otherwise, for down to
the stitching on the gloves and the bind
ing on the Derby (pronounce Darby) It Is
comme 11 faut.
Sun Francisco girls may be a seam be
hind the times In the matter of ultra-fMfc
ionable habits, but as for their riding. bÂ«
It single-footer ot trotter, they can pao*
ail comers.
The list of rood riders is a long one. but
by general accord and Captain Dllhan's
consent Miss Rose Hooper Is placed at
the head of the local list. Miss Hooper
sits a horse as only a finished equestrienne
can, horse and rider moving as one. Her
mother. Mrs. Hooper. Is also a aplendld
rider and past grand mistress of all the
arts pertaining to the craft of horseman
ship.
Miss' Marie Wells and her cousin. Miss
Marie Oge, are enthusiastic riders, having
forsworn almost all other delights for
the beating of hoofs. The "Sweet Maries"
both ride well, and are connoisseurs In thÂ«
matter of thoroughbreds.
Miss Alice Mofnt is as much at home la
the saddle as on the golf links. She 1b a
rider who recks not or ditches nor fences.
Miss Mofflt will dare a mount that would
try the courage of most horsemen.
Miss Mabel MoDonald of Santa Rosa
is the best cross-country rider of them all.
The higher the fences the more she enjoy 3
th" leap. Breaking In horses 1b a favorite
pastime of this Diana.
Mrs. Walter Magee. assistant In the
gymnasium at. the University of Califor

A trip from Berkeley to the Tosemlte

put to blush by riders of any burg on

When Dewey was the executive officer
of the Colorado. Admiral Farragnt's flajj
ship. it happened that for some misde
meanor two sailors were confined in the
"hrip," as the ship's prison was called.
When Dewey was making- h!s regular tour
of inspection over the ship he heard one
of the prisoners say: "Anyway, I've got
some matches that were overlooked in mv
pocket, and I'll burn this Â©Id ship under
him."
Dewey said nothing-, but stepped on deck
and rang the lire bell. "Fire in the ship's
brig," said he, as the crew rushed up in
answer t.> the summons.
Instantly four streams of water were
pouring into the brig through the holes
in the door, and in a f< w moments the
two prisoners, alarmed ai i!<-' situation,
wore howling to be saved from drowning.
"When he thought they wore sufficiently

Perhaps you knew Mrs. BniÃiiiciv whfti

How did she do the willowy trans

Not L>y doing, them .now and then! but
every morning; and night of the week, and

for "dolce far niente" will slowly but

It's one tiling to have a beautiful figure,
nr.fi a more difficult thing to keep it.
Eternal vigilance is thÂ° price of more
things than libertyâ a beautiful figure, for
instance. t>o ye of forms divine takÂ«a an
ounce of prevention of these exercises-
for your less perfect sisters a pound of
cure, full measure. Is necessary.
While Mrs. Bruguiert: was waiting for
the photographer to readjust his camera
she j chatted about- the exercises. 'I'VO
Phown them to any number of the girls and
they just bubble over with enthusiasm
in the beginning: They go homo and try
to become sylphs in one nigh:. They get
up i:- the morning a bundle of aches and
pains and that lasts a week. They for
swear all exercises and shut their eyes
to flesh that creeps on apace.
"If you're really in earnest you must
use your intelligence In this as well as
any other matter. In the beginning a
few momenta are sufficient to lame ntlff
muscles. Begin gently if you v.-ouid lim
ber them painlessly and effectively.
"Just before going to bed at night mid
first thing in the morning lake your exer
cises. Wear a loose robe that allow? per

to make fun of such things. It Is hardly
h fueling of pity, probably not even .1

day boy common sense shows them tha
diiTerenoc In point of view.
But nt night :i!l is different. Then, whan
the children play, Stanley astounds them
by seeing what la in darkness to them
and his hide-ami-seek under these condi
