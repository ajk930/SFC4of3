CRITICS OF AMERICAN
SOLDIERS DENOUNCED
Chaplain McKinnon Excoriates Detractors of
Brigadier General Funston and of Himself.
The Lecturer Bitterly Rebukes the Monitor and Pays an Eloquent
Tribute to the Aimies in the Philippinesâ The Story
of the Looting of the Church at Caloocan.
A SENSATION was created last i
night at Metropolitan Hall when ;
i the Rev. Father William D. Me- '
// Kinnon Rave his contribution to '
The controversy which is now be- i
l:;g waged over the conduct of American
troops in reference to churches and !
church property In the Philippines.

Father McKlnnon devoted a very con
ri'lerable part of the evening to a general
discussion of the Philippines, outlining
inn Incidents of their occupation by the
Spaniards, tracing the events that fol
lowed the war with Spain and the Ameri
can seizure of Manila. He entered into
n minute discussion of the resources of
the Inlands and predicted that under a
liberal government the- new possessions
of the United States could be made Im
mensely profitable. Even In the natives
the reverend gentleman saw a great deal
to admire and very little to condemn.
ITaviTig given his hearers a tar but
frricf description of the peorle and oon.M
lions that the American soldiers met in
their campaign of progress, the reverend
*:< % mJeman described many of the battles
In "whirh the First California Regiment
rartldpated. All this proved, however.
lujt introductory to the main theme of the
evening, which was Brigadier General
FunFton and the charges which have been
made against him.
"I read this morning." said Father Mc-
KJnnon. "sorncthln;? that I never knew
Iwfore about the battle of Caloocan. I
T'-ad that Colonel Mctcalf had shot dead
in cold blood m, Filipino prisoner. I know
Colorel Metealf and know him to be a big-
Ix-arted. generous, wholesouled follow. I
raw all the prisoners at Caloocan and I
know that Colonel MetcaJf was not guilt
of the offense charged against him. And
row for the church at Caloocan. We have
l.card a great deal of it. and before you
leave to-night you will hear a great deal
more and learn something of the looting
tir.d desecration that Is laid si the doors
c>t the American soldiers. On October 3,
a year a^o. four months before the Fil
ipino* were in insurrection. I visited the
church at Caloocan and â¢â¢ was then a
Filipino ban-arks, from which everything
rncred had Im-Â« n taken. That was long
before the American occupation of the
church on February 7. and I can - ...
no desecration in the act of the American ,
troops in making of the church what it
had been made by the insurgents months
before â a barracks.
"And what I have said I will say again,
that there was the looting and desecration '
cif churches, the dp*;>ollment and robbery
cf their sacred vessels and vestments. I I
will f^adly admit that these precious ar- '
ticles had been carried by American sol
diers from the s<at of war. ! will not
deny this fact, but I emphatically Insist
that the American army is not In tho >
e lightest degn-e responsible for these out- !
rage*. During my twelve months' stay
In the Philippines 1 was with General I
I-awton. with General Wheaton. with
General King, wlih General Smith and
vith General Mac Arthur, and my eyes '
were otKfn and 1 had at heart as dearly
Â«.* any â¢â¢:â¢â â¢ United States the in
terest* of my church, and 1 say to-night
that I never naw the looting or the dese
cration of a church by un American sol-
CicT.
"And I say la reverend and Irreverent
BÂ«ntlcmÂ«*n, to misguided and foolish edi
tors, that this looting and desecration
vhlch we all deprecate was committed by
insurgents, by Chinese, nnd by them
alone. When the campaign began the
Btrlcteit orders In reference to the*e mat
ter* were tesued by General Anderson.
TjÂ«.Â»o orders were read again by Gcnerai
The San Francisco Call
Merritt and published broadcast by Gen
eral Otis.
"When In our march we entered a town
we would meet the Chinese loaded down
with these precious relics and sacred ar
ticles, and when after our entrance our
soldiers took command. I received from
the general in charpe strict orders to pro
tect the churches and all they contained.
CHAPLAIN McKIMNQN EXCORIATES HIS CRITICS.
j I was told that I would be held responsi
ble personally for the churches and wh.it
, belonged to them, and that I could have
| whatever guard I deemed necessary to
assist me In the work. I round that there
was very little to protect, but what there
| was I guarded. I recovered from the Chi
nese depredators scores of sacred articles
which I sent to the Archbishop of Ma
1 nlla, ( *oi: not oth^r American &oldjt-i.s
I have done the same and brought them
j home?
"Throughout the campaign the condi
tion of affairs was as I have represented
it. and If any American soldier looted or
robbed, despoiled or desecrated Philip.
Pine churches. I must have been blind.
If these gentlemen who are so anxious
to uphold the dignity of our church in
stead of Betking to cast opprobrium on i
American soldiers know that they
have but to go to the Presidio and if they
find any church property they have only
to report their discovery and the prop
erty will be confiscated and returned to
the rightful owners. l will speak now i
more particularly of but one man. Briga
dier General Funston.
"I speak of him because he is one who is
not of that class of bigots that hate the
name Catholic and all that it means. I
know him as a brave, generous, high
minded man and I feel grieved that
against one of the bravest, noblest, broad
est generals who fought in the war of the
Philippines such unjust, absurd and ma
lignant charges should be made. It seems
strange to me that the editors of some
of our papers should open their mouths
like ducks to suck in the lying testimony
of soreheads and accept their evidence
against that of four men who, above all
others, have a rig] to speakâ Father
Reaney. the chaplain of the Olympia;
Father Hart, Father Fitzgerald and my- ,
self, four priests whose lirst duty is to
their God and whose only obligation is to
tell the truth.
"Rather than accept the testimony of
these priests, these editors swallow the
words of me drunken scrub who was in
the guardhouse more than anywhere else,
who was sober only because be could not
get drunk. When the Reverend Father P.
C. forks was the editor of the San Fran
cisco Monitor that newspaper was a great j
power In our midst. We were proud to
see that Its light of Intelligent criticism I
threw bigots deeper into the darkness of
their own malice; that when religion '
needed a defender it was first to the
front; that when the good name of women
and the honor of men needed a champion
Father Torke and his pen were not found
wanting. We were glad to know that un
der the lashing scorn of Father Yorke and ;
the Monitor the pulpiteers, cheap editors
and scribblers sought their hole; but how
the Monitor has fallen from Its high es
tate.
"Its editor goes out of his way to in
sinuate against the honesty and the sin- '
cerity of Catholic chaplains. He follows
cringing In the wake of political sheets as
Insignificant as his own to brand Catholic
priests as hirelings of the administrationâ
as paid supporters of Urn Res ublicau car.

' have reached here that there v it
â  a pitched battle last night at Fort

between a company of the Ninth
i I U. S. Cavalry (colored), garrisoning tho
fort, and 7iW Citizens who attacked the
* ' post shortly after dark. Three thousand
â¢ shots were said to have been fired dur
> Ins the fight, but the casualties are not
, known here. It Is also said that all th*
i women and children have been Bent away
from Rio Grande City and that runners
are out after reinforcements for the citi
zens. The military authorities are occu
pying the telegraph wires and full reports
. cannot be obtained. That the affair Is a
; serious one Is Indicated by the activity in
military circles here.
Major Thompson, in command at Fort
Mclntosh, bought up all the Krag-Jor
gensen ammunition in Laredo to-day, and
is hurriedly loading a special train with
mules, baggage, etc., to take the avail
; able force here to the scene of the trouble
| and a special train Is en route here from
San Antonio with a company from Fort
Sam Houston to Rio Grande City.
AUSTIN. Texas, Nov. 21.â T0-day Gov
ernor Sayres was in receipt of a telegram
from the commanding officer of the
United States troops at San Antonio con
veying the Information that there was a
race riot at Rio Grande City last night
between the Federal troops stationed
there and the cltzens of that town. About
the same time another telegram came
from the County Judge at that place, and
the telegrams are somewhat confusing.
The military commander at San Antonio,
General ItcKibben, telegraphs that the
report he received from the commander
at Fort Rlnggold. near Rio Grande City,
states that all the troops were in the
garrison last night at 7 o'clock, whin
the citizens of that town advanced on the
fort and fired upon the guard. The guard
returned the fire and the entire garrison
was at once called to arms. The citzens
continued their firing u}Â«in '.he- fort, the
1 soldiers return- ii thÂ« fire "ami Anally had
to bring their Gatllng guns Into play to
disperse the attackers. The commander
states that he fears further trouble and
asks for more troops.
The telegram from the County Judge
states that the negro soldiers In the forts
there deployed in a ravine on the edge of
the town and Ured into the town for about
an hour and a half, shooting into a num
ber of house?, wounding one man, and
frightening th. women and children so
badly that a number of them had fled to
the surrounding ranches for safety; that
the. attack was entirely unprovoked and
that the community was highly incensed
and further trouble was looked lor at
once.
Upon receipt of these telegrams. Gov
ernor Sayres ordered Adjutant General
Scurry to the scene of action and he left
to-night for his destination. The Governor
also telegraphed to Washington to have a
full Investigation of the matter and to re
move the negro troops. The commander
at Ban Antonio sent a special detail of
officers to the scene at once to Investi
gate. All is quiet to-night.
This afternoon Governor Sayres sent the
following telegram to the Secretary of
War at Washington:
Please direct Immediate. Impartial and
searching Investigation into the conduct of
nrÂ»?ro solJiers at Fort Rlnggold. Starr County,
Texas, last nUM. Also issue orders for Imme
diate removal of troops.
Following telegram Just received from the
County Judge of Starr County: "Negro soldiers
at Kort Rianold deployed In a ravine at the
south edKe of town at 7 o'clock last night and
tired about 15C0 times into and over the town.
The fu.-'.11.i.1f tinned at intervals over one
hour and n half, one citizen was wounded
In his house. Houses all over town were jw?r
forated by bullets. Women and children fled
to the woods and ranches. The population Is
terrorized. I fear the people may decide to
avenge themselves for this dastardly act. The
civil authorities would iâ¢â  powerless to run
trol. I understand that l.i. lit.-' ant Rubottom,
commanding, directed this cowardly assault.
No cause for the act. Wire Washington and
San Antonio for searching Investigation and
removal of troops at once."
JOSEPH D. SAYKKS. Governor of Texas.
Governor Bayers received the following
official message from the commanding
general (McKlbben) In charge of Texas

for Laredo with a detachment of the
, Twenty-fifth Infantry to make an inves
tigation of the trouble at Fort Rlnggold
. and to make a full report to General Mr-
Klbben, the department commander. Gen
eral McKlbben has consulted with Gov
ernor Sayera on the subject and has been
asked by the Governor to take whatever
steps In his power to conciliate the citi
zens and the soldiers. Trouble between
the negro soldiers on the frontier posts
and the Mexican population has been
brewing for some time. a collision be
tween the police and negro soldiers 'at
i Laredo a few weeks ago has resulted in
i the abandoning of the post there, A
small-sized riot also occurred at Rio
Grande City last month, in which some
soldiers were phot nnd others were ar
rested and fined. Since then the Mexicans
and soldiers at Rio Grande City have been
at the bitterest enmity. w "

To the People of the United States: Garret Augustus Hobart. Vice President of the United State* died at his
home In Paterson. N. J.. at 6:30 o'clock this morning. In him the nation has lost one of It* most Illustrious citizens and
one of Its most faithful servants. His participation in the business life and the lawmaklng body of his native Stato
was marked by unswerving fidelity and by a high order of talents and attainments; and his too brief career a* Vice Pres
ident of the Lnlted States and President of the Senate exhibited the qualities of upright and sa . aclous statesmanship
In the world of affairs he had few equals in hi* contemporaries. His private character was penile and noble He will
long be mourned by his friends as a man of singular purity and attractiveness, whos* sweetness of disposition won all
hearts while his elevated purposes, his unbending integrity and whole-hearted deTotlon to the public good deserved and
acquired universal respect and esteem. , -r^
In sorrowing; testimony/of the loss which has fallen on the country. I direct that upon the day of the funeral the

NEW YORK. Nov. -Garret A.
Hobart, Vice President of the United
States, died at his home In Paterson,
N. J., at 8:30 o'clock this morning.
At his bedside were Mrs. Hobart and his
son. Garret A. Hobart Jr., together with
Dr. William K. Newton and his wife and
Private Secretary Evans.
Mr. Hobart's death had been expected
for some hours. Yesterday afternoon
there was a SUdden failure of the heart,
and from this attack Mr. Hobart never
rallied. He had been sick for a long time
and had suffered frequently from heart
failure, nd hi" rÂ»*n^t h iuul hcen under
mined. Gradually the failure .of the
heart's action became more apparent, and
soon after midnight last night Mr. Hobart
became unconscious. He remained In that
condition until his death.
Mr Hobart's death was due directly to,
angina pectorls, complicating myocarditis.
Owing to the prostration of Mrs. Hobart
the funeral arrangements will not be con
cluded until to-morrow. The only step
decided upon is that the services shall be.
held In the Church of the Redeemer at
Paterson and the interment in the family

daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Hobart was
burled six years ago. Rev. Dr. Magee will

, eager to attend the services it is ?uic
ge3ted that they be held in the armory,
which accommodates 10,000 person**. It is
known, however, that Mr?. Ilobart wishes
the funeral to bÂ« as quiet as possible and
there is little likelihood that the pro
grame will be changed.
The Mayor and Aldermen of Paterson
have suggested that the body lie in state
i at the City Hall on Friday or Saturday
morning, and this suggestion probably
will be carried out. . The pallbearers have
been selected, but their names will be
withheld until they have been notified and
have :irrppted I
Nearly all the representatives of foreign
nations In this country have sent m. â â â¢
sages of sympathy to Mrs. Hobart. One
of the tlrst to express his sorrow at the
death of the Vice President was President
McKlnley, who had bren notified by tele
! phone by Private Secretary Evans. At
torney General Griggs. who was in Wash
ington, telegraphed that he would return
to Paterson at the earliest possible mo

maladyâ dilated ripht heart, due to myo
cardlsâand he remarked:
"Well. If it must be that I am to pro, I
may as well bo rcslftned to my fate."
On the morning of October 31 It was
thought that the end had come, but the
patient rallied, and for more than a week
continued to improve and eat solid food
with a relish. Three days ago. however,
his appetite failed and he gradually grew
weaker and weaker. He realized a few
hours before he berame unconscious that
he was near to death, and he said to tho*e
about the bedside:
"I know that my time is nearly up. but
death Is welcome to me."
Mrs. Hobart remained In the r^

until she and hÂ«-r son. who was with her,

The last mange for the worse In the
Vice President's Illness occurred yester
day afternoon, when he was seized by a
weak spell. ' He had battled through sev
eral similar attacks and it was thought
for a time that he would come out of thin
one. He did. but he was very weak, and
It was plain to be seen that he was sink-

to be cheerful, but toward midnight hlÂ«
condition was beyond hope. Dr. Newton

All the Hags in Washington are half

city, where he was loved and honored.
The news was :r * 1 received at the White
House shortly before 9 o'clock in a
private message from Paterson. inÂ«
flag over the Executive Mansion was
hauled Immediately to half-mast and the
mansion closed to the public.

The President retired to his private
apartments. His close and Intimate re
lations with his colleague made him feel
the Mcc President's death as a personal
bereavement. Mrs. McKlnley was great
ly aflected. She gave way completely to
\K r r .5 riof and sobbed convulsively. Mrs
McKlnley ha* but few Intimates here and
among her most cherished friends were
the \ice President and Mrs. Hobart.
President McKlnley did all he could to
comfort his wife, and did not return to
his cmce until the members of the Cabi

The members of the Cabinet were made
acquainted with the sad news as soon as
the President himself was inform. by
moans of the telephones from the White
House.

the President, returned to the State De

sent a private message to Mrs. Hobart
expressing his sincere condolence, and
then gave his attention to the prepara

>!cuth of the Vice President to the people
of the Lnlted States. It was also neces
sary to convey the news to the nations
of the world.
Tbis was the regular Cabinet meeting
day and the members gathered at the
White House at 11 o'clock, but the death
of the \ ico Prt-Fldent overshadowed all
else, and public business was not men

especially Attorney General Grlggs,
I showed the emotion which they felt.
Attorney General Grins left for
Patr-rson# Immediately after the Cabi

Vice ProKident Hobart were probably
closer than any two men In public life
in this administration.
The flags over the public buildings wero

this t litre was no outward evidence of
mourning and no drapings, as â  law of

this period when it was necessary for him
to teach school and keep books !n the
evening to make his expenses. It is even
â aid that he knew what It was to go to
bed without supper and trust to some
friend for his breakfast. This struggle
lasted for about three years, after which
he became a full-fledged counselor md
clients became plenty. He began to dabÂ»
ble in small politics and for many years
held unimportant places. He was once
clerk to the grand juries, and about -his
time lost the political favor of his an
cestors for deserting their Democratic
traditions and becoming a Republican.
This was a fortunate move, for In April,
1871, he was elected City Counsel. Here
was the real beginning of his public iife.
The next year he became counsel to the
Hoard of Freeholders and was elected to
the State Assembly from the Third Pas
saic District by the largest vote Ihe dis
trict had ever given.
Mr. Hobart's record was that of an ac
tive, aggressive legislator. .He was so
able in this position i lint he was elected a
second time in 1573 and chosen Speaker.
His constituency promoted him .it the
next opportunity and he went back to the
capital to be chosen President of the
State Senate. He introduced more bills
than anybody else, and was during his
term In the lower house chairman of sev
eral Important committees. He i 6 the
author of some of the nÂ».>st important
measures bow upon the New Jersey
books. It was his Idea that the law was
enacted which provides for the summary
judicial investigation of the affairs of any
county upon the application of twenty
five freeholders, an ad which has been
used many times with splendid results.
Another measure of his was the statute
charring the sinking fund of the State
with the payment of all interest and part
of th. State debt yearly, reducing the or
dinary expenditures some $lw'.ooo annu
ally, which was the cause of the removal
of the State taxâ one of the facts upon
which New Jersey prlrfos itself more than
any other. He also drafted and secured
the passage of the bill calling for the ar
bitration of strikes and troubles between
labor and capital. There was a disposi
tion to give him more honor, and in ivs|
he was the choice cf the Joint caucus for
the United States Senate. The Assembly
was largely Democratic, and he was nat
urally 'â (â â .â â â  by John R. Mcl â â¢â¢ ( .n.
who was a lifelong Democrat.
This was tie end of his ofllceholding.
nnd he began a most remarkable business
career. He made money rapidly, and be
nfxt appeared In politics as one of tbe
managers and directors of the campaign
of Mr Rlame.
Law was his profession. He was want
ed In the si ness world, and in a few
rears he was so deeply in commerce that
he had no time for he practice. His
first place of Importance was the receiv
ership of the New Jersey Railroad. This
place called for the greatest financial
tact. He so managed the affairs of the
corporation that the road was *oon put
upon a substantial basis and started on
the way to subsequent success. He next
was placed In control of the Montclair
Railroad and the Jersey City and Albany
line, arid he repeated his successes. The
First National Bank of Newark failed.
Mr. Eiobart was asked to settle up the af
lairs. This he did so skillfully that with
in six months lie paid all depositors in
full. His, reputation ss a financial man
ager having been established, he was of
fered many places and his ndvlce whs
held at a premium all over the State. He
acepted many of them, and the top of bis
desk In his office bad a letter file with
twenty compartments In it. each devoted
to some corporation in which he was very
largely Interested.
All this, however, did not keep Hobart
busy. In ISSI he â ought a wider field of
politics. He was made chairman of the
New Jersey State Republican Committee.
He held this place for a year, resigning
to accept an election to the National Com
mittee. This honor he held without inter
ruption s<r.ce ISS4. He was one of the
managers of the Blame .campaign, â  and
worked with E'.kins and B. F. Jones. He
hns been on the Executive Committee and
ln the State ranked as a leader in the
class with Plait, Quay, Manley, Clarkson,
Fessenden and the others who know the
game of politics as other people do not.
He helped control the destinies of the
party until Mr. Hanna appeared In the
tield. This new leader called him to go
up higher, and Mr. Hobart was willing,
having picked out the place more than
two years before. It is related that this
ambition of his was formally declared at
a luncheon at the borne of William Bar
bour, at Monmouth Beach. General Har
rison was there at the time, and it was
before the general decided he would not
stand for re-election. Mr. Harbour at the
time called attention to the fact that Mr.
Hobart bad not announced himself as a
candidate for the Senatorship or the Gov
ernorship, and was free for some greater
honor. He predicted the ticket would be

Kinley buttons appeared four weeks be
fore the convention, and the McKinlev
papers in Ohio vere Riled with stories o"f
the life and doings of Carrot A. Hobart.
His nomination was settled, and there
was never a time when the combinations
against him could have been effective
Mr. Hoburt married the beautiful
daughter of his legal mentor. Miss Jennie
Tuttle. He did this in ISC9. when she was
a mere girl, and he but 23. There were
two children. Fannie and Garret. In

the daughter died. Mrs. Bart is still hi
mourning, and has not recovered from the
terrible -hock. Garret is a fine, mnnly

none if the beauty of her young days, and

FUNSTON CONTROVERSY
GROWING VERY WARM
Monitor Offers to Defend a Suit
in Lieu of a Bet.
Fox Reiterates His Old Charges and
Makes New Ones and Also Produces
Certificates of Services Rendered.
IN* response to the open communication
from General Funston published in yes
un!a\'s Call, the editor of the Monitor
U :it the following reply:
Editor of The Callâ Sir: I beg the
favor of space in your esteemed jour-
I nal to notice as far as it applies to
myself or to the Monitor Brigadier
General Junston's proposition with
reference to certain statements impli
cating him in the looting of Caloocau
church. The betting arrangement to
which General Funston has recourse,
in lieu of a threatened action for
libel, is a positive disappointment. It
is neither dignified nor conclusive. It
does not seem to me to be a becoming
mode of proc dure for the settlement
of such a question as the one in
volved. I should feel inclined to ac
commodate General Funston, how
ever, if it were not against my prin
ciples, personally, and against the
principles of the publication with
which I am responsibly connected, to
arbitrate questions of fact on a purely
gambling basis.
If General Funston has been libeled
by the Monitor he is not dependent
upon the friendly offices of Rabbi
Voorsanger or any number of amiable
and impartial friends of that gentle
man for redress. The courts are wide
open to him, as they are to less dis
tinguished citizens. As a defender of
our institution, it would be far more
in keeping with General Funston's
official position and character to take
up this matter regularly, in accord
ance with established forms of law
under those institutions. Should the
complainant lose his case in a libel
suit there is nothing, that I know of,
to prevent him forfeiting his SIOOO
to the lied Cross Society, if he saw
fit to do so. On behalf of the Monitor
I cheerfully promise to donate double
that sum to the same excellent organ
ization in the event of the verdict be
ing in his favor.
I have small respect for courage
which passes the lie at long range
from behind the safe shelter of a
newspaper communication. I may be
pardoned, I trust, for expressing the
opinion that that sort of thing corre
sponds admirably with the tinsel
glory with which General Funston
has been surrounded, as I understand,
through the industry of a careful,
personally conducted literary bureau.

THOMAS FOX.
When he referred to the scrub that was
oftener drunk than sober and longer in
the guardhouse than out of It there was
an angry retort from the gallery. Some
body was shouting an Incoherent protest.
It was Thomas Fox. the author of the
story of desecration !n the Philippines.
Mr. Fox suppressed himself and remained
quiet until tne lecture was over and he
reached the street. There for a moment
or two he held a few Idle listeners. The
strictures of the Monitor to which Father
McKlnnon referred are as follows:
Our esteemed contemporary, the Northwestern
Catholic, is Inclined to take a cheerful view of
Secretary Root's refusal to send additional
Catholic chaplain* to the Philippines For this
refusal. It declare*, Catholics may feel thank
ful to God. "The Catholic Church in America
ought to be completely Independent of the ad
ministration. If it la expected of Catholic chap
lains that they shall Junket arounrd the country
and do the unclean work which belongs to poli
ticians, then an army chaplaincy Is no place for
a Catholic priest. If our Catholic soldiers serv
ing In the imperial colonies are to receive the
ministrations of the church, let It economize In
the matter of great cathedrals and select for
the work a few prleats deemed above the
temptations of of nee and of salaries." There Is
some strange Infatuation In the "hideous and
damnable masracre" now proceeding in the
Philippines, avers the same journal, that turiu
the clerical mind from solicitude for souls to a
consuming anxiety for the salvation of the ad
ministration.
Under the caption "General Funston Cleared"
a Detroit daily newspaper gives, editorially
this version of the theft of the famous robÂ« or
the Caloocan statue: "Rev. W. H. I. Reaney.
chaplain of the Olympla. has completely dis
posed of the church desecration charges made
against General Finiston and the Kansas Vol
unteers. Father Reaney says that the church
at Caloocan hod been used by the Filipinos for
military purposes tome time before the United
States troops arrived. The church had been
thoroughly secularized and the natives had
stripped It of everything of value. After the
American troops occupied It somebody discov
ered a garment alleged to have been part of !
the raiment of a statue of the Virgin and pre
sented It to Mrs. Funston. Father McKlnnon

THE GREAT
DOCTORS.
Remarkable Cures Being Effected at
the State Electro-Medical -
Institute.
The Return of the Great Physicians
and Specialists Hailed With
Delight
By th 3 Weak, the Sick and Afflicted of the
Pac fie Coast
Fclence. fklll and knowledge Is abso-
lutely necessary for the successful
practice of medicine and surgery.
Those qualities, when coupled with fair
and honest business principles, are
bound to insure patisfaction to patients.
aiÂ« well as preat increase in practice.
The best evidence of the science and
eklll of the celebrated physicians and
specialists of the State Electro-Medical
Institute Is the success attained in
treating the sick, the weak and debili-
tated, the lame and the unfortunate of j
bcth texes, whose minds are all but
Â£one aa a result of thtir own follies.
CttrÂ«s which others might term mira-
cles are now being effected by these
great physicians. Unlike other special-
ists, the doctors demonstrate to the sat-
i>faction of the patient their ability to
cure by a treatment before entering
into an agreement to treat. It Is these
fair business methods, in conjunction
â with their science and skill in handling
! disease, which causes their rooms at
737 Market street to be thronged from
morning till late in the evening. It
dots not cost anything to consult the
â <3octors. No incurable cases are taken.
The electrical department of the in-
Ftltute is equipped with all kinds of
electrical appliances, including gal-
vanic, faradic and static electricity â all
known to possess remarkable curative
powers: and. whin coupled with spe-
cially prepared medicines under the
tkillful eyes of the physicians and spe-
cialists of the State Klectro-Medical In-
stitute, the effect on disease is like
throwing oil on troubled waters. This
le bring demonstrated dally â not In iso-
lated instances, but in dozens of cases.
Rheumatism, acute and chronic; lum-
bago, sciatica, etc., quickly succumbs
to the combined electro-medical treat-
ment of the celebrated specialists. The
effects of the treatment on such dis-
eases must be seen to be appreciated.
The cures are not only speedy and won-
derful, but really miraculous. There is
no longer need to suffer tortures from
attacks of the above dreaded com-
plaints.
Tbe great specialists cure all difficult
diseases of men and women, including
nervous df-bility and all its attending
ailments of young, middle-aged and old
men. The awful effects of indiscretion
In youth or excesses ln after life, and
the effects nf n*Â»gl^cted or improperly
tr*-atf-d cases, weak back and sexual
weakness.

HARDSHIPS ENDURED
BY OUR BRAVE TROOPS
MANILA. Nov 21.â The whereabouts of
Generals Lawton and Young is becoming
as mysterious as Aguinaldo's. The be
lief is beginning to grow at Manila that
General l^awton has struck the trail of i
the insurgent â¢"government" and is pur- I
suing the Ministers into the Binqua
Mountains. It has been his ambition to
capture the Filipino leaders, and he and
General Young believe that a cavalry
brigade living on the country could run '
them down to any part of tne island.
One vague report brought in by Spanish j
prtsoners is that Agulnaldo and others
were nearly surrounded by Americans !
soon after the Insurgent chief left Tar- i
lac. but he escaped through the lines in >
peasant's clothes.
Officers and soldiers arriving at Cab- j
alanuam among General Lawton's force !
describe the campaign as one of great j
hardship. Many men dropping out sick <
were left at various towns without ade- â¢
auate supplies and attendance, some of |
them making their way back across the
terrible roads. i
A number of horses were dying and
many of the soldiers and even some of
the officers were marching on. half naked,
their rlothes having bÂ»Â»en torn to pieces
In getting through the Jungles. Some of
them were reduced almost to breech
clouts and hundreds were barefooted.
th*>lr shoes b^lng worn out. and all were
living on any sort of provisions. Bread
was rare and rarabao meat and bananas
were the staples.
General Lawton foresaw that the cam
paign would involve such hardships, but
he considered It the quickest and cheapest
way of ending the war.

The second was from Colonel Baden-Powell, dated at Mafe

WHERE A BIG BATTLE
MAY NOW BE FOUGHT
LONDON. Nov. 22. -The eye.Â« of strate
gists are now fixed on the territory lying
wen Orange River, De Aar Junction.
Queenstown and Aliwal North. Here, it
is believed, will be fought the first battle
!on General Buller*! line of campaign.
I Reference to the map and the latest Â«ji-!
i patches will i how that the British have
| blocked the 80-Â»r advance along this line,
| and a few days are expected to bring
; news of the â tart of a movement to hurl
the invaders back. The Boers are In
force north of Hopotown and Orange
River, hut the British force at the latter
place prevents further advance in that
direction. The Boers are also in Colos
burg. but the British block the way
south of Nauwpoort. The Invaders at
Burshersdorp and Btormburg Junction
â¢ are held in check by General , Gatacrc's
division at Queenstown. Some experts be
lieve that Gatacre's llrst move will be
to reoccupy Stromberg.

it is eiperted that General IfafhMcn'u

their advance.
Some close observers are skeptical about
the published plan of thla advance. They
point out that If It was the intention to
relieve Kimberley via Relmont It Is hardly
probable thai the military censor would
allow the publication of the information.
A move In the direction of Bethu'.le
would catch thr Boers between the col

from Queenstown. and the garrison at

to have Iâ â¢ ra abandoned by the Hoers.

SHIFTLESS COOLIES LANDED
IMMIGRATION COMMISSIONER IS
POWERLESS
BfCMons Why tbe Secretary of the
Treasury Will Urge a Chang* in
th* Law Governing th"
Chinese Bureau.
The announcement In yesterday's Issue
of The Call that the Secretary of the
Treasury was considering the advisabil
ity of turning the management of the
Chinese Bureau Into the hands of the
local Immigration tuireau at this port
with United States Iromteratlnn CnmtnU
tJoner Hart North :is its head provoked
COSflldcrable comment in the Custom
house. Many of the oM timers approved
of the Idea and called attention to a point
on which the so-called exclusion act con-
UictÃ with the general immigration laws
and confers u;>on certain natives of China
privileges denied to thÂ«> natives of Great
Britain. Germany. France. Italy. Russia
and others of the European nations. This
is the privilege granted to Chinese pau
pers rflttTcrair-s^trd^Ttb^F Â«ndwlr-ahle per
sons of that nationality to land in ihe :
Vnlted States without having to pass the
scrutiny of tho lmniiÃiation ollirials.
Take, for instance, the ease of a Chi- !
nese laborer returning to this country on
his certificate of registration. If he !
hhnws that hÂ«> Is the person to whom the ]
<<Tti!irate had benn gr.int.Ml he is allowed
ti> land. 110 matter how much of a pau- i
jÂ«Â«-r lie may be. while* the Kurnpean la- ]
LnrÂ« r is dcnli-d a landing unless he can
â¢â¢how to the nat lsf action of the immlgra- I
tion officers that he is able and has the j
means with which to support himself.
This is a discrimination In favor of the
Chinese and against all other aliens, and
it is argued that it would he no more
than Just, even under the present condi
tion of things, that the Chinese laborer i
after having been landed by the Collec
tor of the- l'ort FhouJd bo turned over to
the immigration ollirials for them to as
certain whether he does or docs not come ;
under thÂ« head of ulUns not entitled 10 j
be landed.
It is argued also that the immigration
bureau is the logical body to deal with
the jirovisions of the exclusion act a^d to I
handle ail immigration, no matter of what j
race or kind. The immigration olllcers j
h:ive nothing else to do than to look after J
immigrants, and there is no logic in turn- i
ing Chlmse Immigrants over to the Col- I
lector of the l'ort instead of to the Com- t
missloner of Immigration.
Collector Jackson very justly complains
that the rrefsure of Chinese business 1
k< <ps him in his offlco until 6 o'clock >
every evening, and that even working ;
overtime he cannot keen up with the de- ;
m.tnd upon his time. The Collector, !â¢<*- 1
ing the only person who ran order the !
landing of a Chinese immigrant, it fol- !
lows that n" matter how many Chinese j
lnsjo'cTors there may be. the bulk of the
work falls upon him Just the same.
These are i-ai<l to be among the vital
reasons which hnve induced the Secre
tary of the Treasury to make prepara- 1
lions to lay before <"ongross the neces- I
pity of amending the <xciuslon act so that
the Hut. au of Immigration will have sole
control and relieve the Treasury Depart- |
tner.t from the burden and annoyance of
the yellow tltif.

advice of City Attorney Lane decided
not to recommend that the second assess
ment levied by Assessor Dodge on per
sonal property of the San Francisco and
San Mateo road was canceled. The rail
way company was represented by Judge
"W. B. Cope, who argued that it was an
injustice to the company, which had al
ready paid its taxes to the St;"- Con
troller on the assessment levi. .Â«>â¢ the
Hoard of Equalization, to pay a second
time.
Attorney I-ane stated that a test should
be made of the question whether the city
or State nad a right to assess the prop
erty of railway companies operating In two
counties. Judge Cope replied that be did
not think 4t fair that the company should
be made the scapegoat for a settlement
of a mooted question.
William Clayton, manager of the rail
road, supplemented the remarks of Judge
Cope by ttating that the assessment of
Assessor Dodge was an arbitrary one,
while the assessment levied by the
Equalization Hoard was based on a
voluntary statement of the company,
which had been done for six years past.
San Mat 00 County hn<l not assessed the
road and he denied the right ol San Fran
cisco to collect taxes after the taxes had
been paid once to the State. Attorney
Lane, however, was obdurate in the mat
ter and the committee refused to recom
mend the cancellation of the duplicate
assessment on his advice.
As a suit of the committee's action
the company tendered tho sum of VCi 81
to Tax Collector Sheehan a* taxes on its
real estate and refused to pay taxes on
$115.2^0 on Hacks, rolling stock, etc.. and
on JCO.'XM representing the franchise,
which it claims has already been as
sessed by the State ami tho taxes paid.
The Tax Collector refusal the offered
amount on the ground that he is obliged
to collect the full amount of taxes or
none at all. It Is likely that he will.
when the taxes become delinquent, pro
cÂ«*ed to sell the property to tlie State. in
which event tho State Controller will
probably ear.eel the county assessment
on the ground that it ha* already bien
paid.

Speculation is rife as to the purpose the
company has in view, and the rumor that
it it- the* ultimate intention to move the
Sacramento shops to West Oakland has
been revived. From railroad men who
are in a position to know it is learned
that the triangle will be the site of the
company's immense works as soon as
they *are moved.
The plan Is nut only one of concentra
tion but also ot economy. The railroad
managers have argued for a long time
that the shops now at Sacramento could
1,1 operated at far less cost if situated
where they were easy of access to ship
ping. A while back there was a rumor
that the shops were to be moved to the
â¢â¢Jill" along the narrow gauge mole, on
the Alameda de. but It apparently had
no foundation In fact. The extensive, im
provement that the company has under
taken along the Oakland mole and the
immense amount of money that will
necessarily be expended In Its completion
is not without a purpose and lends color
to the statement that a site is to be made
for the big shops now located at Sacra
mento.
One of the officials at the Oakland yards
made the following statement to-day
"The vast additions to the West Oakland
yards are the direct result of the big flre
last summer at Sacramento. When the
Sacramento shops were burned down not
a hit of work could be done for three
months. It was all done In Oakland and
in such a convÂ«nlÂ»-nt manner that the
company concluded It would be better to
keep a great portion of It here permanent
ly. It has been decided all the coachwork
for the whole of the coast division shall
be done here. This will necessitate the
construction of several new sheds, the
building of an addition to the mill and the
laying of much new track. It will add
a largo number of men to those now
steadily employed, besides requiring; the
temporary services of many more."

Ryan had a little one last Sunday morn

FOOTBALL SQUABBLES.
Quarterback Ellis on the Gridiron of

ii is all ov.r the quarter-back Â«>r the
team, BUia. WO! be play on Thanksgiv
ing day or not? That is what is troubling
their inind> at pr> ent.
At the last meeting of the Pacific Ama
tcur Association the question of Ellis*
amateur standing was brought up before
that body. and the conclusion was that
Ellis did not have the status of a good
amateur under the laws of the American
Athletic Union, and therefore could not
mingle with hln confreres without con
taminating their athletic constitutions.
When this was announced a shout went
up at Berkeley condemnatory of the coast
association and a counter peal at Palo
Alto which deified the actions of the ath
letic censors.
Ellis was formerly an Instructor of gym
nastics at the University of Nevada, and
this, as the Pacific Amateur Association
declares, unfits him for such a purely
amateur contest as the Intercollegiate
football game. In their eyes he Is a pro
fessional. The offense is, however, slight
and the Pacific Amateur Association nan
passed a counter resolution to its first,
which exonerates all those who may
play with or against Ellis from â  profes
sional conduct.
As the matter now stands It rests with
Manager Berry of Stanford to determine
whether Ellis will play or not. If he
withdraws his opposition California will
play Ellis. If be holds out against him
it Is very likely that Ellis will have to be
withdrawn.

Cod Liver Oil Emulsions are
designed to build up the system

be active and perform its proper
duty the emulsion should be
fresh. Should it stand for a

remedy for pulmonary diseases,

II Ik vÂ» F*or<Â» out a â warrant yestcr
''day in Police Court No. 1
eharjrinp her husband. Julius
H. Rialto. a theatrical painter, with
listurblni? her peace.
As mipht be Inferred from such a
proceeding, the Rlalto* are not in har
mony. In fact, they have been llvinff
apart for some months. Before the
reparation, however, they both made
their livelihood by the stage. Mrs.
Rialto Is a dancer and needs calcium
lights in her business. Rialto. in order
to keep as much ns possible of the sal
ary in the family, manipulated the
slides and worked the "Klim" <>n his
wife as she pllded through the ser
pentine or did poses plastl<jn<? in all
the colors of the theatrical rainbow.
Whether or not he objected to the
fact that his wife always had the
center of the stage is not known. They
disagreed, and Mrs. Rialto packed her
beloneir.KS and took up her residence
at SOCB Webster street. She told the
warrant clerh yesterday that she be
lieved her husband was Kettinff flighty
and In support of her statement re
could be until the winsome \\ Una crossed
the threshold. The husband fought her
company and neglected his wife. Miss
Hurd Is charged with t-ncouraging him
In his attentions and laughing at the pro
tests of Mrs. Monti.
Their love affair became so notorious
that the gossips of Ahuneda learned of
11 and for a time it proved one of the
most salacious morsels that they had to
roll about their tongues. Their comments
and the publicity that followed forced the
Monti family to move to this city, where
the wife hoped her husband would be
beyond the captivating Influence of his
Alameda love. For a while Mrs. Monti
congratulated herself upon winning back
her erring spouse and never suspected
that he and Miss Hurd were as thick as
ever until he was taken sick. And then
cajne the telltale letter. -â â 'â 
While Monti was being nursed back to
health by his devoted wife Miss Hurd
called at their home on Stockton street,
near Filbert. Sho did not see Montiâ she
made no request toâ but she left a note,
which act subsequently proved to be one
of the most disastrous of her fashionable
career. Monti read the epistle, smiled
when he thought his wife was not looking
and contemptuously curled up his lips
when he caught her glancing in his direc
on He tore the letter Into very small
pieces and cast them on the floor, but
thÂ»-y did not escape the vigilant eye of
the wife and her mother-in-law. whose
sympathies had gone out to her. When
tne room was swept the next day not a
piece of that letter was lost. A pastepot
and patience did the rest. Miss Hurd
had written words of burning love and
recalled pleasant moments she had
passed with Monti. If Miss Hurd had
written no more all might have been
passed over, hut her self-admiration got
the better of her Judgment and she said
pleasant things about herself and some
very unpleasant things about Mrs. Monti.
The husband was given no intimation
that his secret was Known until he re
covered and prepared to return to his
work. That morning his wife packed up
his belonglngÃ and carried them out on
the street. Then, backed by her mother- i
in-law, she told Monti to go and stay
gone.
That same morning Mrs. Monti crossed [
the bay to Alameda. There was fire in |
her eye and determination in her de
meanor. After nearly a day's search she
located the residence of the woman whom
nhe accuses of breaking uti her home.
The Interview was short but exciting. ,
Miss Hurd boldly but unwisely declared
that she was in love with Monti and that
his affection for her was stronger than It ,
was for his wife. Mrs. Monti does not put
up a scratching and hair-pulling fight.
She struck out from the shoulder, and tho
very firs; blow landed on one of Miss
Hurd's eyes and put the optic out of use
'or many days. This was followed by a
Â«mack on the cheek that brought the
>each color. From all accounts it is there
vet and all ti â¢ complexion that Mis*
Hurd has purchased has failed to oblit- I
â¢rate It For some minutes the fight was
'ast and furious and only stopped when \
he gay young Wllna took to her heels
md escaped the wrath of the wronged
vlfe.
Monti has moved to Alameda. presum
ibly to be near his Inamorata. Mrs. Monti ,

Hasty Marriage Will

Oakland Office San frandsoo Call,

Another hasty marriage has ttrmlnated
In sad disappointment and bitter separa

Butaatoo, wh<-> has brought suit against
Kveland P. E^glaston for an absolute

Charles ESSBieston'fl matrimonial ven

CARR ACCUSED OF
INHUMAN BRUTALITY
DENIED SLAPPING HIS DYING
WIFE'S FACE.
Judge Conlan Holds Him to Answer
Before the Superior Court on a
Charge of Manslaughter.
The preliminary examination of Thomas
J. Carr. laborer at the l'n!.Â»n Iron Works,
charged with manslaughter in connection
with the death of his wife, was concluded
before Judge Conlan yesterday, and hÂ«
was held to answer before the Superior
Court, his bonds belnj,' lixed in $3000.
Lieutenant Anderson testified that when
he went to the house. 13 Michigan street,
to arrest Carr he was in the kitchen He
was brought to his wife's bedside and he
â aid:
"Polly. If you tell the lieutenant not to
take me away I will go to bed."
She replied:
"Tom. I won't. I want you taken away
so that I can die In peace.*'
At that time Carr did not deny slapping
his wife's face. Policeman Lewis cor
roborated the lieutenant and the prosecu
tion rested.
Attorney Curtis moved for a dismissal,
but the Judge denied the motion.
Mrs. Josephine Schwartz, a sister of
Mrs. Carr. was called for the defense She
testified that Carr provided well for his
family and she never saw him slap his
wife face. She did not know that Can
had disposed of a bottle of medicine in
stead of giving it to his dying wife Mrs
Mary Daly, a next-door neighbor: Will
iam Carr. a brother of the defendant and
Andrew Coakley. a grocer, testified that
Carr was good to his family in the way
of nro\id!ns for them.
The defendant took the stand and de
nied slapping his wife's face. He said her
mind was not sound at times before s'ie
died. He did not get angry because she
left the property to their son and not to
him. The Judsre said:
"I cannot accept the responsibility of
dismissing the case, and it will have to go
before a jury. 1 don't know if a Jury will
convict him. but In my opinion his wife's
de.ith was hastened by his Inhuman bru
tality."

Testimony.
Two "mashers" were in the Police Court
yesterday to answer to the charttes of In
sulting yo-ir.g girls. Hoth were still suf
fering from the effects of sound thrash
ings administered by the fathers of their
victims. In addition one of the accused
was sentenced to ninety days In the Coun

fair way also to receive the full penalty of
the law.
Julius Rufus, a barber, was the first of
the tribe to feel the fist of the father
and the hand of the law. Edward Hun

Volunteer Infantry, naa yet to have his
Case 'li-termlned.
Rufus waa arrested on a warrant sworn

Judye Graham. The testimony
showed th:u Myrtle EL Baylor, wh>. :s a
pupil at the Polytechnic High School.
was waiting for hÂ»r sifter on the corner
of Bush and Stockton streets oti the after
noon of November 14. Just after school
had been dismissed, when Kutus came up
behind and jostled her.
"Hello:" w said, "are you waiting ior
me?"
The young girl, frightened at the "mash

'â â  inp nothing.
w.-ii. ain't you waiting for me?" he
asked again.
"No," she replied sharply, at the same
time starting across the street. Being an

-: that the "masher" did not follow.
: the girl stopped on the opposite corner
till Kufu.s began making si^ns to her,
when she left to report the matter to her
| father. He was not at the restaurant
when she K"t there, so Â«he toij her story
to one of the waiters, who at once put
on Ins c..at and hat and started for Bush
â¢ et, where he found Kufu.s. evidently
waiting for Bbme other s. hoolglrl upon
whom to practire his wiles.
The waiter taxed Rufus with his mts
deed, and the Mk>w acknowlec!Â»
saying as an excuse that he mistook Miss
Baylor for a girl of his acquaintance.
Mr. Baylor heard of the insult to
his daughter he be< ame very angry and
w.-r.t in search of the barber. He did not
find him until the next day. when Rufus
was pointed out to him by the waiter.
Savior promptly turned in and gave ttie
"masher" a erond thumping, following it

"Just cut me out of anything like that,"
retorted the e.mrt.
"He will not do it again," continued the
lawyer.
"Not for the next ninety days." said the

Rufus was then given in charge of the
bailiff to serve his ninety days.
K. H. Perry was the complaining wit

week while walking with his 15-year-. dd
dauphter up Hush street he noticed the
soldier accost several w-..men. but paid no ;
particular attention to It until, having oc

again to see Hansen trying to talk to his
daughter.
"What did you do then?" asked tne i
court.

The Jud^e asked Lyons why he did not

replied that he could not help It.
"Well." replied the Judge, "I want to

PHENOMENAL TAX SHIRKING-
*~1 HE decision of Judge Morrow of the Lnited
States Circuit Court lan week, by which he re
xr.anded to the State tribunals two cases brought
agrainst Wells, Far^o &. Co. in this city to compel
that corporation to pay its war taxes, substantially
proves that though the mills of the law grind slowly
they grind wr.h exceeding certainty. These actions
were commenced in October, 189 S. They followed
c!osÂ»ely upon the Co*t!cy case, in which Justice of the
"Peace Barry and Superior Judge Troutt successively
construed the law against the tax-shirking company.
rÂ«>r more than a year, however, the corporation his
delayed a tnal on various frivolous pretexts. The
cases v ere first taken to the Federal courts â¢on a
jurisdicticnal point. Judge Morrow promptly decided
that he could not consider them and sent them back
to the Justices' Court. Then the agile lawyers of the
tax-shirki:iK' company sued out a writ in the United
States Circuit Court on the theory that as a common
carrier it is collecting revenue for the Governmentâ a
laughable contentionâ and was. therefore, entitled to
the protection of the Federal judiciary. But Jud^e
>horrow could not be made to understand this. and
apain he remanded the cases to the cold and cheerless
jurisdiction of the State courts.

of that section has begun to express opinions
c subject. These opinions are what might have
been expected. The Eastern people, to a considerable
extent, at any rate. wi9 oppose all efforts to provide
for any comprehensive scheme of irrigation, and it
is clear we are to have a hard fight and probably a
long fight before we win.
The Baltimore American, in speaking of the plan,

made to .->. rament in modern times. The peo
ple who settled the East and made it blossom as a
rose never thought of asking the Government to grub
up the stumps or put up fencing or to do any other
thing that won bate to the profit or security
of farming, nor did the people who went from the
â¢ to settle the mighty Wen ask their Government
tn Â«rake them."
Such is the attitude of a large proportion of the
Eastern people toward the movement for national
irrigation. It is regarded there as a scheme to tax
the East for the benefit of the West. It will be seen
tliat we must at once undertake a campaign of edu
cation on the subject and prosecute it vigorously.
After all it may be found that it would be cheaper for
us in California to undertake water storage for our
selves rather than wait until the East has been
brought to, understand the enterprise and co-operate
with it.
GIFTS TO HEROES
A MOVEMENT is on foot to present Rear Ad
miral Schley a house. Other gifts to the
heroes of liie Spanish and Philippine wars are
contemplated. It is to be hoped that these projects
will be abandoned. As far as is known none of the
intended recipients are in want. As a rule the projects
originate in the desire of some one to achieve no
toriety on money gotten by appeals to patriotism
or to the ever-present sentiment of hero worship.
Men trained to arms enter with deliberation a pro
fession in which they are set apart from the masses
ot their countrymen, in order that in martial emer
ies they may do their duty. It is to them an
injustice to make it appear to the world that their
duty is done in the expectation of substantial pres
ents. The eight Boers who made a new Ther
'.ae on the blear veldt of South Africa, by stand
ing their ground as a target for British bullets in or
der to give a large body of their comrades in arms a
chance to reach safety in the hills, probably had no
other thought as they faced the guns of a brigade
than that they were doing their duty, and no hope
nor expectation of any after reward had place in their
thought. The approval of their heroic souls was all
they had and all they hoped for.
An American feels uneasy at the first results of the
giving of gifts. Admiral Dewey was given a ready
made house by his admiring countrymen. As he
quaintly said, he wanted a house all ready, where he
could go at once and hang up his hat. At that time
it was not known that there was a lady in the case,
who also had a hat to hang up. But there was, and
in a honeymoon exuberance the admiral has given
the house to his wife. The result is a most remarkable
reversal of public feeling that illustrates the exceeding
volatility of our people. Ten days ago every Ameri
can boy born into this world was marked to bear the
name of Dewey at his christening. That name to
conjure with was adopted into commerce as a trade
mark for many things. But now it is regarded with
a different feeling, and the hero's picture is hissed
when shown in the kinetoscope. Scores of sub
scribers to the fund are rather indelicately wor
the committee for a return of the money, and an ef
fervescent enthusiasm has been turned into the spirit
of carping and criticism. The event is calculated
tn subject Americans to ridicule and to take the fine
bloom off the feeling that pervaded the country and
(ion in the welcome given to the great
admiral. But it seems that the countr. Mr:,.
Dewey, a very rich woman, was not in need of a
house, and draws a distinction between giving him a
mansion in which his wife and family are sheltered
under his ownership and giving Mrs. Dewey a house
in which the admiral hangs up his hat on her suffer
ance. To put it squarely, the country seems to feel
that the lady had a large lot of luck in getting the
foremost man in the world for a husband, .
not have had a gift house thrown in. As a consola
tion to the any - who want their money back
we beg to that they may fir.! comfort in that
scripture which snith that it is more blessed to give
than receive. They gave the houÂ«e and grounds
and hatrack and pantry, and, we hope, a well-stocked
cellar, and have already received the blessing with
which they would part if their money were refunded.
In that respect they cannot eat their cake and keep
it. Then, really, it is unfair to demand that the com-
C give bick the money, for the only recourse
they have is to pay it out of their own pockets or to
ask Mrs. Dewey to sell her house and return the pric^
to them. We hope the donors will see how enihar
rassing this will be to the committee. It will be bet
ter to proceed now to raise the $100,000 required to
earn- out the proposition to have the Dewey Arch
in New York City made a permanent structure by
reproducing it in marble. That will perpetuate the
hero's memory, and, as he cannot deed the arch to
i:e, the country will pi"">s an inalienable me
morial of the battle of Manila Bay.
THE DEATH OF HOBART.
Q MERICAM sympathy will be profoundly
/ \ stirred by the announcement of the death of
L *â  Vice President Hobart. The feeling of sor
rnoreover, will be due wholly to personal respect
the man and for the family which he leaves to
mourn his
Mr. Hobart had but a small part in the politics of
the country. Before his nomination for the Vice
Presidency he had no national fame, and since his
election he has of course accomplished nothing in
the office affords no opportunities
for doing so. The reputation he has achieved in
office has been the re>tiit of his tact and courtesy in
life, in presiding over the Senate, and in the
deeds which made up the routine of life in official
station at Washington.
Few Vice Presidents have been more highly es
teemed or have more justly merited the honors con
ferred upon them. As a rule a Vice-President is for
gotten almost as soon as elected, and is recalled to
public attention only when there is some danger to
the life of the President. It has not been so \viÂ»h
Mr. rlobart. He did not live obscurely at the na
tional capital, but made himÂ«e;f felt there as a per
sonal influence which had to be counted as a potent
factor in social life and to some extent in the Senate.
Notwithstanding his success in the office he found
it uncongenial, and it is well known he would not
have been a candidate for re-election. He was vir
out of politics before his long illness began,
and his death, therefore, makes no change whatever
in the political situation. The nation mourns the loss
not of an office-holder but of a citizen of the highest
rank and the truest patriotism. Such duties, public
or private, a> devolved upon him were fulfilled with
a fidelity that entitles him to the honor of his coun
tiymcn. and it is with that feeling the people receive
the news of his death and extend their sympathies to
all who were near and de?r to him.
A veracious correspondent from the Philippines
says that the Sultan of Sulu has a deep-seated an
tipathy to Christian dogs. The Sultan evidently ob
jects to a change in his religion.
The operations of the loc.il "relipious" general,
who is at present under a police cloud, indicate that

The Prince of \Va!e? hag subscribed Â£262 to the

DEWEY'S SON NOW
GETS THE HOME
Second Transfer of the
Gift House.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Nov. âGeorge Good
win I 1I 1 â  if. Admiral Dewey's only son. is
now the owner of the residence pre
sented to the admiral by the American
people. Papers were prepared and
signed early to-day by which Mrs. Mil
dred McLean Dewey transferred all
rights and title to the property known as
1747 Rhode Island avenue, this city, to
George Goodwin Dewey. This is the
property which yesterday Admiral Dewey
transferred to Mrs. Dewey. The papers
making the new transfer probably will
be placed or. tile to-morrow morning.
In explanation of the transaction prac
tically completed to-day, a relative of the
Dewey family made this statement to the
Associated Press:
"Admiral and Mrs. Dewey have trans
ferred to the former's son. George Good
win Dewey. the title to the home pre
sented to the admiral by the people of
this country. It will continue- to be the
home of the admiral and Mrs. Dewey so
long as he may live.
"It may be desirable now to say that
It was the wish of both the admiral and
Mrs. Dewey to provide for a proper suc
cession to the property. The transfer of
to-day completes the transaction begun
yesterday and Is the carrying out only of
the original intention of both .he admiral
Â»:.<! Mrs. Dewey. By all those interested
in the matter the "method of transfer
made v.as considered the best and safest
that could have been adopted. It Is to
be considered naturally thai the trans
fer was to be the act of Mrs. Dpwey as
well as of the admiral. It was her de
sire that she should release any claim Â«he
mieht have to the property through her
marriage to the" admiral and to do this
the transfer was made through her to
the admiral's sen as Boon as was prac
ticable. Through the method adopttd
no dispute ever can arise over the dispo
sition of the property."

FUNNY SITUATIONS
AT ALCAZAR THEATER
The true significance of a funny situa
tion may only be appreciated when the
author of a play has solved the great
problem of presenting his ld*a without
literary frescoes. It is therefore often
apparent that a pantomlmfc Joke has far
more rapid effect than a Joke clothed in
fine literary apparel. The great secret
of the fun In "My Friend From India" la
not so much in the cleverness of the lines
(although there are a few exceedingly
comical dialogues) as in the silent humor

background of this play upon which seme

stronger in the delivery' of his lines tHan
in his characterization. In fact, with
Stockwell it is nearly all his looks, while
with Ormonde it is the execution which
is the most comical. Both are very
clever. Juliet Crosbj^does the female
comedy work and proves herself wry
efllclent. Truly Miss Crosby is a very
versatile actress. Any artiste who can
play one week the Queen of Franco in
"The Musketeers" and the following
week Tilly in "My Friend From India"
as M: Crosby has done, is entitle*! to
the highest indorsement. Such ver
satility is the evldenqp of artistic m
perament and inborn talent. Clarence
Montaine has not very much to do, but
that little he does with his well known
faithfulness to detail. Miss Gertrude
Foster f n the leading role makes a very
charming Marian Hayste. The beauty
about Miss Foster's work may be sought
in its unaffected quality. There is no
restraint about her acting and no desire
to overact. The manner in which she
imitates a society dame does not bear any
traces of affectation, but is exactly what
It ought to beâ a. humorous Imitation of
an existing human weakness. This bit
alone oujht to bring Miss Foster the ap
proval of her audiences.
Marie Howe Ts another character who
lends luster to the performance. Besides
her striking personality Miss Howe Is
always fetching. Her work never lacks
esprit and there is a certain air of dash
surrounding her action which one must
necessarily admire.

SECOND RECITAL OF
THE HOLMES QUARTET
The Holmes quartet gave its second
concert at Century Hall yesterday after
noon. The feature of the programme mi
Brahms" piano quintet in F minor, Arthur
Ftckenscher acting .â¢â  pianist. While I
believe Mr. Fickenschcr to be a soloist of
considerable abilityâ particularly in the
technical lineâ l hardly think he is lit Tor
ensemble work. His attack is too vigor
ous and the various ehadings are there
fore not brought cut strikingly enough.
Brahms requires delicacy and emotional
execution.whlch Mr. Ficker.scher unfortu
nately lacks. Ensemble work is a gift by
itself and must be inborn rather than ac
quired by practice. Henry Holmes him
self Is a splendid executant and seems to
discover the iptrlt of the composer. Thus
outside of the piano part this quartet re
ceived a good rendition, although at times
the ensemble work was not quite as clean
as it ought to have been.
But the quartet redeemed itself in tho
Beethoven quartet in C. The allegro
molto movement was executed with a
dash and power Inspiring in Its fervor.
This was. according to my idea. th*Â» best
work done by the quart- I so far. It did
not only show that the members of this
body are musicians but that they are
absorbing with effect the healthy ideas
of their leader. This last quartet alou*
established for this organization a posi
tion which will give It prominence in ths
musical field. The vocalists on this occa
sion were Misses Beulah George and
Zueletta Oeei and Fred Maurer acted
as accompanist. ALFRED METZGER.

weather all the way down the coast. The
South Portland. Empire and Arcsia wore
all bar-bound In Coos Hay for two days.
but on Saturday last they got a slant
and passed out over the bar nt noon.
"A heavy southeast gala was blowing,"
paid Captain Hall yesterday, "and after
about an hour of It the captain of the
Arcata yut back. The Empire still held
on, however, and the last time I saw rer
she was off Cape Arago. It came up
very thick for a few hours and when it
cleared the Empire was not in Bight. Up
to 10 p. m. yesterday it blew a hurricane
and then it moderated. All day Bun
day It blew fresh nnd there was a very
heavy sea. Sunday night It began to
rage again and all day Monday we
caught it. There were times when going
full speed we did not make three knots
an hour p.nd then again we would get
i a slant and come along at a fairly good
gait. Under the circumstances we did
very well indeed In making the run In
seventy hours.
The steamer State of California arrived
from the Columbia River yesterday after
noon. She wag ten hours behind time,
having taken fifty-three hou"rs to come
down from Astoria.
The steamer Townsend arrived In
Puget Sound yesterday and reports the
old I.aura.ia a total wreck on St. Georges
, Island. The Laurada was on her way to
Cape Nome, but was caught In a succes
sion of storm* and run ashore to save
life. The Townsend was fitted out .iere
with wrecking appliances and sent north
to salve the cargo and If possible save
the vessel. Much of the cargo was re
covered, but the old filibuster will never
be seen again.
Thf news also comes from Seattle to
the Merchants' Exchange that the wreck
of the whaling bark Mermaid was sold to
a Captain White for $400.
J. Daily, the popular chief clerk of the
Merchants' Exchange. Is back at his desk
after a two weeks' vacation spent In Yolo
County. Mr. Dally had not been In very
good health before he went away for his
holiday, but he Is now as well as erer.
He received a very warm welcome when
he appeared "on 'change" last Monday.
Mrs. Dally accompanied her husband
i during his wanderings in Yolo County.
There are not many transports left In
port after the exodus of Monday. The
Duke of Fife and thÂ« St. Paul got away
yesterday morning after going into the
stream Monday night. The Duke of Fife
was â¢lav.cl owing to the fact that *ome
of her life preservers and life rafts had
not been nut aboard, hut as soon as that
oven whs rectified she went to sea.
The transports Ohio and Indiana went
to Poisons-street wharf yesterday and
will probably get away to-morrow. The
Columbia was moved to Stuart street and
she and the Dalny Vostok are scheduled
to sail Saturday. The Warren Is still on
the Hunters Point drydock, having her
steering gear and rudder fixed up. She
will probably come to the Government
wharf on Thursday. She will not get
away until the end of the month.

LAST OF THE
VOLUNTEERS IN
PRESIDIO CAMPS
Arrival of the Forty-
Ninth Infantry.
ONE BATTALION IS MISSING
MORE TROUBLE IN THE TENNES-
SEE REGIMENT.
The State Will Not Put Up the Fare,
So Many of the Men Will
Go Home as They
Please.
The last of the volunteer regiments has '
arrived. Not all of it is In. but there Is
enough to warrant the speedy appearance j
of the remainder, and before this even
ing, unless there Is another smashup on
the Southern Pacific lines. The first two
I battalions of the Forty-ninth caught the
I rain as they left the cars at Fourth and
! Townsend street*, and they took it with
them out to the Presidio. The Forty-
I ninth Is camped In the tents of the Forty
1 fourth, to the right of the terminus of
the Union-street cars.
The regiment came West from Jeffer
son Barracks, Mo., in three sections and
a baggage train. As usual with troops
there was a wreck, but this time It af
fected the baggage train. One horse was
injured, but he will got well again, and
one car was so badly damaged that it
had to be sidetracked. Altogether five
cars were derailed. Following after
I the baggage train were two sections, each
carrying a battalion of the regiment.;
The third battalion Is somewhere on the j
way now, and it is hoped It will get in
to-day.
The Forty-ninth Is under command of
I Colonel Beck. Its lieutenant colonel
lls A. C. Ducat. formerly an aid
I on General Shafter's staff, who
j became well-known here in the
line of his official duties. He Is an In
fantry officer who has a record for gal
! lantry won In the Cuban campaigns.
Colonel Beck Is an officer of the Tenth
Cavalry, U. S. A., a colored mounted I
regiment.
There is more trouble over the home
goliig of the Tennessee Regiment. It has
been announced to the men that the State
will not pay their railroad fare back !
home, a position which is in strong con
trast to every other State whose volun
, teers have landed here in San Francisco.
They have all paid the fares of the men.
There is not a regiment of State volun- j
teers that has not gone home on a special
train hired by the State to wnich they
belonged, ana Tennessee is the first to |
ask the men to give up part of their last
pa] to xhe railroads. As a consequence !
there are a great many of the men who
have Joined with those who said they
would not go home as a body nor woflld
they take part In any State demonstra
tion in their behalf. It looks as though
there will be no more than 300 of the
Tennessee soldiers who will go home to
gether and parade at Nashville on their
1 arrival. The soldiers blame the Gov
ernor of the State for the condition of I
affairs.
Reports .rom the detention camp at
Angel Island, where the Forty-eighth

Reports from the detention camp at the
Presidio show two cases and one suspect.'
who Is more than probably affected with
the disease. \
The Ohio will clean the Presidio out of
recruits when she Balls, for there is an
order out that she shall take away four I
hundred and there Is not more than two
! hundred and fifty at the post now. This
i will leave the Presidio devoid of recruits
i for the first time since the war broke out.
Of these two hundred and fifty one
i hundred are ordered to the Indiana un- i
der command of Captain E. A. Fry,
â  Thirty-sixth Infantry, and Second Lieu- ;

DESK STUDIES FOR GIRLS: READING COURSES.

in. READING COURSES AND A
GIRLS LIBRARY.
The Reading of Novels.
No more common disease affects the
reading public than the love of novels.
If the intelligence of girls were In pro
portion to the amount of fiction they rc\.d.
the future would be bright. The indis
criminate selection of novels is what
makea the situation especially la 1 It Is
rot contended â¢â  I works of I
Should have no place in a gtrl's 111 I
On the contrary, tlctloii is â  department
Of literature which
re I>r. W. T Harris styles it
"the bait by which we create a 1
reading, and It should lead nut t<
reading, especially In the line of science
and history and philosophy." A child
should read much fiction, but the amount
should be lessened as the years go by. |
A girl of 10 may read live times as many
novels as works of poetry, biography,
science or history. When she has reached
to) her literary taste has been poorly culti
vated if fiction forms half of what she
reads. Ideals have their place no doubt ,
in the aspirations of youth. It Is not, J
therefore, surprising that children readily
read books that stimulate the love of the
Imaginative. Thousands of persons are
reached by the noveiist who are too young
to follow the essayist or the biographer
or to appreciate the dearer vision of the
poet. Undoubtedly the great writers of j
fiction have been valuable teachers of I
the masses. The good novel will cultl- |
vate the del re 1 â¢ KCeJ In what Is en- j
nobllng. A certain class of sentimental !
novels present serious dangers to the i
mtrnla of persons dissatisfied with their i
conditions. The 'works of Action perused'
should give a true and not a false view
of life. The novel has Its place because |
the imagination cannot be fully satisfied j
with history, biography, travel or even
poetry.
It Is the abuse and not the use of fic
tion that is at fault. The only pra
ble plan is to regulate ri"vi raiding.
There Is such an Ã¼bundance of gr.od Ac
tion that tb< re Is no excuse for spending
time with what Is only second or third
rate. Many a girl spends hours In
Ing books which no good Judge of litera
ture would ever add to tier library. It Is
not enough to avoid novels which stimu
late the passions, :Â«nore or mislead the
conscience or i
are fundamentally false and debasli |
read only :. novels is k
but this advice Is not enough. :
not the b.-st kind of literature f"t
men or women. 1
even good novels ar.- r.<>t always well In
are often very shal

ter. rhii'iren naturally like stories, but
surely a girl should not always remain a
child, icetrf-.-iin will cloy the appetite if
a m.-al Is begun with It.
It until the more substantial artlci
eaten. In Ilk'- manner, tiie first part of
one's lelsu: day might !
ployed in reading solid works of litera
ture.
If fiction were taken up as a recreation
Its advantages would be more lasting. It
is impossible for a girl to love Dickens
without becoming large hearted. If she
appreciates Thackeray she will receive
thoughts of value. The works of Mrs.
Mulock-Cralk, Miss Alcott and Black
have given many a girl In a rough and
poor home an Insight Into what develops
a higher womanhood. It is a mistake to
suppose a girl should read whatever Is
for the time popular.
How to Read.
To know how to read Is as important as
to know what to read. It la useless to

and moral faculties are cultivated. <iir!-<

11. ARITHMETIC OF THE OFFICE.
Lesson No. Iâ Proportion.
It Is taken for grantpd in these lessons
that the* student understands the ele
mentary rules of arithmetic, including
fractions.
The subject of proportion as It Is gen
erally set forth In arithmetic la best ex
plained by Illustrations:
Example a. If 7 yards of cloth cost 63
cents, tlnd the cost of 12 yards.
It 7 yards cost 63 cents 1 yard will
cost C 3-5-7, or 3 cents, and 12 yards will
cost 12X9, or $1 OS. Now 7 bears the same
relation (ratio) to 12 that til does to 10S.
These two ratios, when placed together,
axe called a proportion:
7 : 03 : : 12 : 108
7 : 12 : : 63 : 10S
Here we have two proportions. The 7
yards bears the same ratio to its price
that the 12 yards bears to Its price, and
the 7 yards bears the i uae relation to the
12 yards that the price in one instance
bears to the price in the other.
Example U. If 5 men can do a piece of
work In 12 days, in how many days can 6
men do the work?
If 5 men can do the work in 12 days 1
man can do the work in |> 12. or 60, days,
and 6 men can do it la one-sixth of the
time, or 10 days.
Example C. If 27 1 , yards of cloth cost
$10 23, what will 22& yards cost?
It Ib necessary to divide by 27' ito find
the cost of 1 yard, and to multiply the
quotient by :(."â¢.. in find the .
yards. The simplest way to do this is
by what is known in arithmetic as can
cellation.
This can be rcj : â  â¢â  ns follows:
To divide by n\t I*s equal to multiply
ing by 2 nnÂ«l dividing ' nd to mul
tipl>
and dividing by 2. B) cancellation the
labor is reduced, as shown below:
The same result Is obtained by multi
plying l"'-3 by 32> 2 ami dividing the prod
uct by IT 1 -. Here we divide 5 into 65
thirteen times and into 55 elev. n tin -
11 ilivi<]*-a IOCS nln. ty-thrt c times, ami J
cancels 2. The result is 1.1 times' I
The studi-nt will ni>w pro 06 id |o
iotva the following examples:
1. If T7', yards of cloth are worth 19
find the value of 1000 yards.
2. A certain article of merchandise Is
marked Jl 36 a dozen. Find the value of
43 such articles.
and a definite line followed. The read,
ing habits of some persona are largely
mechanical. A book to be useful must
be read in such a manner as to stimulate
the brain, enlarge the undemanding and
Inspire to noble purpose. It is foolish to
devour many books without some settled
plan. Unless reflection follows, it does
ilttle good to read. Elizabeth Uarrett
Browning gays: "We err by reading too
much and out of proportion to what wo
think." The gifted poetess has recom
mended concentration. Too often there
Ist no system In the selection of books, and
what is read dots not cultivate thought.
Many persons regard thinking- as hard
work. They forget that effort, self-con
trol and e\>n hard work may be needed
if mental growth is not to be stunted.
There may te real enjoyment with dis
cipline.
It is well to have regular hours for
reading. If possible a set time should b>
assigned for study. With many periona
this may be difficult. Every girl has,
however, some opportunity for self-Im
provement. Women have been known t.>
read while waiting for the kettle to boll
or while rocking the bale* to sleep. Mary
Somervllle. authoress of "The MechanUm
of the Heavens." did much valuable work
as a student, although she had also to
take care of her family. Devotion to thÂ»
customs of modern society should not bo
allowed to stand In the way of Intellec
tual progress. Better to decline attend
ing some of the "at homes" than to be
Ignorant of books. Conversation li en
joyable when there is something to tal!:
about. A girl who knows nothing Is
very poor company. An intelligent
young woman, if she has culture at tho
same time. Is nure to gain esteem.
So far as possible, a person's rea-ih g
should be by subjects. The subject
chosen should have sume bearing upuii
the duties of life. / Many girls .iave no
special course marked out for them
selves. They take up their time wltn
the first bookâ usually a novelâ that
comes to hand. Their 111 of far-> haÂ« no
reference to the kind of food which Is
needed to promote mental growth. At
tention to one., subject at a time aoes not
Imply that the reader should become ac
quainted with only one branch '.f knowl
edge. For the majority of girl- generil
information Is required. Of course, it a
young woman Is preparing herself fcr
some special calling, special reading will
be necessary. The ftiggestlor.s given In.
these papers have particularly In view
that numerous class of girls who do not
expect to follow professional pursuits.
The art of skipping Is a very (.eslrabla
one if wisely employed. For young per-
Eon.s it has its dangers, as It leads t >
puperflclal reading. A well-read student
can get at the pith fa paragraph wit**
out going through every line. One ho Is
familiar with the dally newspapers .'s
able, II Intelligent, to see at a gtanco th<Â»
facts and arguments of an article. The
art of skipping Is ally the art <f shun
ning what Is frivolous, misleading or for
eign to the ma n purpose. It ' evident
that this power of careful selection re
quires the keenest faculty of perception
and an eye that sweeps In everything n
Its range. Too many girls have a cer
tain habit of skipping whlrh Is harmful.
A-< a .e^ult their reading become*
scrappy and fragmentary. It lacks thor
oughness. Th*Â»y get probably what they
are seeking, but what they gather Is of
the lightest character possible.
Reading should not be continued when
the mind Is fatigued. Fo- the majority
of persons this advice Is unnecessary.
Apart from novel reading, there li not
much excessive attention to good litera
ture. Intellectual Idleness Is on? of tho
most prevalent diseases of the day. Some
Persons dream away two-thirds of llf*.
Indolent sentiment satisfies thÂ«Â» multi
rode, rather than the storm an.l bartls
of life. The star of hope above does
not guide as many as would be desirable.
At the same time. It must be acknowl
edged that some young women are un
mindful of health In their lam:ab!o ef
forts to gain knowledge. When thÂ«
mind Is exhausted books should ba la! 1
aside. To rob the mind or body rf
rest brings Its inevitable penalty. Great
readers should be gre.it thins Intel
ligent thought demands that the brain
have time to recuperate.

NEW YORK. Nov. - -The character of the

amrae ** yesterday, that Is. ln an attitude of
vuitlng. There w<r*> no signs of speculative
furore. ao4 no large organized buying wii
In fildence and such a market hfi* a natural
t<n>sÂ«-ney to gravitate downward. Selling pres
sure was not severe, however, hoiaers of stocks

an advance have been giving assertion* that
triocks <>T flt.UiO.ooo and even of 113.000.000 In
Gnvtrnment bonds were to be presented to the
tub-treaKury and the proceeds used to flood the
money market and force the rate down to a
r.nlnt of ease. There waa no stringency In the
Ki'.ney market to-day, but the money rate
Â»tllTÂ«-r.ra suggestively to 1Â« per cent ln the late
dr&llncs. a* if to Intimate 'hat the supply of

Chicago Grain Market.
CHICAGO, Nov. 21.â Statistics at the opening
In wheat were not of a pronounced character.
Initial prices were unchanged from yesterday's
j close, December W"4667c and May at 71@714c.
Export Inquiry was poor, the world's visible
was expected to Increase liberally and a local
trader recently returned from abroad announced
opinions decidedly bearish. This was sufficient
for the letting out of some long wheat and De
cember sold down to 66% ( 6T66\c, and May to
70 T ie. The strength of corn had a steadying
tendency, and at the decline the market fluctu
ated narrowly on the operations of scalpers. The
first Incentive to buyers came when New York
and Duluth reported a decided Improvement In
the foreign inquiry, and a better business tone. (
Meanwhile the visible had failed to come up to
predictions, showing an Increase of only 716,000
bushels. Shorts bought with considerable ani
mation. December advancing to 67>h4j<7Hc, and
May to 71Sc. The close was 'x'u-V- over yes
terday for both options, December at e74aÂ«7"Â»c
and May at 71* c.
Corn was strong throughout the session, a
condition directly attributable to the rains In
the corn-growing sections. County roads suf
fered and the movement from farms was of a
consequence interrupted. December closed SO
Â»ie higher at 32HÂ©32\c. May He higher
Oats were firm and trading fairly active
though business was largely the changing from
December to May contracts, or from corn to
cuts to take advantage of the spread. Decem
ber closed a shade higher at 23Vic and May
closed 4QKc higher at 224e.
Provisions were firm. Influenced chiefly by
the strength of com. holding In spite of consid
erable selling of December products. January
pork closed &c higher. January lard JV4c higher

disengaged. 7500 tons, against 25.500; on the

WHEATâ The Yolo takes for London 5138
ctls. valued at 13138.
Liverpool and Paris were both higher and
Liverpool showed surprising strength. Chicago
advanced slightly In consequence and reported
a much Improved demand, with New York
selling freely to exporters. One exporter re
ported purchases of thirteen loads. The shorts
bought Corn and this demand helped Wheat.
But large receipts In ' the Northwest and a
large Increase In spot stocks counterbalanced
the firmness of cables. It wu reported that
there were 20.n00.0n0 bushels of Wheat around
Chicago in all positions. The brokers raided
the market at the close on account of the re
ported failure of Mendel Freres at Antwerp
Duluth reported a good cash demand.
The local market sympathized with the
strength of the other markets and futures did
better, though spot quotations were unchanged

The appointment of Dan Gordon as Rep

j a certainty. Gordon has been chief dep

Supervisorial matters are in the same
chaotic state as in the beginning .v,

the customary caucus will not come off
until after the turn of Supervisor Jen

the board are of the opinion that they

from China to the t'nlted States goes
through the Suez canal, because it moves
cheaper that way. although the distance

II goods can be moved cheaper from New

That H. Howie, first lieutenant of the

owes lo his unsteady aim.
Bowie was walking up Stockton street
at abcut midnight last night, when be

and submitted t<> arrest. He was I k< .1
,at the California street station on a
charge of attempt to murder.
Att.r seeing some of his brother officers
he refused to make any statement. The'
