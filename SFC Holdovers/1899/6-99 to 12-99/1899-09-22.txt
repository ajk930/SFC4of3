THE WAR IS OVER FOR THE CALIFORNIA MEN;
THEY HAVE BEEN MUSTERED OUT OF SERVICE
LAST MILITARY DUTYâ VISITING THE PAYMASTER.
THE service of the California volun
teers la wer. The men have been
paid off and mustered out, and
each one has sought his home
with a sigh of relief and an in
-1 tention of staying there.- None of them
will re-enlistâ at least for a whileâ and
for sixty days the regiment will remain
j dormant. At the end of that time it will
I report for duty in the National Guard.
During all the service in the Philippines
there has been kept prominently before
the men of the command this one factâ
1 that they were the old First Regiment, N.
G. ("'.. and as soon as the war should end
the command would go back to the place
â  In the Guard which has been awaiting it.
i By act of the Legislature the men are al
lowed to report back within a certain
time, and within that time the regiment
will go on duty again. As a reward for
a prompt report for duty the Legislature
has decreed that for those who served
with the command and report back within
the time prescribed, service In the war
will count for service In the Guard: and
he who Is again ready for duty will be
credited with continuous service for the
State as well as what honors the war has
brought him. In view of this fact it is
certain that a great percentage of the
men of the regiment will report for duty
In the Guard, although it may be that

many of them will not remain there long.
There was no particular ceremony about
thÂ© proceedings yesterday. The men of
the artillery uattalion were the first to
go. They were lined up by batteries, and
the rolls were called, each man stepping
two paces to the front when his name
was called, the mustering- officer verifying
his records. Then the batteries were
marched up to the messroom, and while
the paymaster handod over their pay their
discharges were given them. That ended
It. They were free to go and do as they
pleased, and all the service they had ren
dered, all the work they had done, was
crystallized into a bit of paper, a few gold
pieces and a memory.
Before his men were mustered out Major
Rice issued a general order. The relations
between the men and officers of the artil
lery battalion have been particularly cor
dial, and Major Rice's order was more in
the nature of a good-by from a friend
than the words of a commander.
The mustering -out of the First Regi
ment was similar in every respect, except
that there were more men. Major Howell.
Major Gilbert and Major Curry, paymas
ters, handled the gold, each paying off a
battalion, and the work took but a short
time.
The property of the men had been drift
ing toward the city ever since the regi
ment arrived, and so when the final day
came there was little more to go. The
records had to be cared for. however, and
also the colors, and these were sent down
to the old armory in the city early in the
afternoon. Two color sergeants from
Company I. the color company, had been
appointed, and these will have charge of
the colors and will carry them whenever
the flags are paraded. They are Sergeant
Henry Lemeteyer and Sergeant Harry
Stolzenwald. They were mustered out as
color sergeants.
In all the First Regiment was paid close
to $150,000. Some of the officers responsible
for property were not paid, nor will they
be until their property returns have been
approved at Washington. One man. Cor
poral Clatanoff of Company G. was paid
nearly $1100. He was with the Eighteenth
T'nitcd States Infantry in Manila, and re
ceived his discharge there, getting travel
pay home. He enlisted in Manila in the
First California, and he was entitled to
travel pay back to the islands. This, with
his regular pay and his extra pay and the
travel pay he had deposited made his
dealings with the paymaster a matter for
envy.
As the California men were going out
the Thirty-second Regiment passed in to
the Presidio, its men every bit as enthusi
astic as those whose service was overâ
but for a different cause. The Thirty-sec
ond is bound for Manila. It will spend a
few weeks at the Presidio and then con
tinue on its way. Its men are eager to be
away from here and off to the trenches '
in the Philippines. Those who have been j
! home, and yet there are those in the
Thirty-second and in the other regiments
| now bound outward who served In Cuba â
1 a campaign as hard as any ever planned
|In .the islands. Perhaps some of those
i men now going home will tire of the
humdrum of a peaceful life and will again
seek adventure in the wars. The Thirty-
I second Is from Fort Leavenworth. Kans.,
ar.d.is composed of men from the interior
States.
Captain Walter F. Randall, Twenty
' seventh Infantry, has been granted a
! leave of absence for thirty days.
A board of officer?, consisting of Colonel
William H. Forwood. assistant surgeon
i general; Major Hugh J. Gallagher, com
missary of subsistence, and Captain Sedg
| wick Pratt, Third Artillery, has been ap
i pointed to examine applicants from the
' Minnesota regiment for commissions in
j the army.
Major Edward B. Moseley, formerly
, post surgeon at the Presidio, has been or

MAJOR RICE'S FAREWELL
TO HIS ARTILLERYMEN
TO THE OFFICERS AND MEN OF THE CALIFORNIA HEAVY AR
TILLERY: The signing of this order terminates the official relat^ns
that have for over sixteen months bound us together as a military or
ganization. For your patience, forbearance and fortitude under the
exercise by me of a discipline slightly less in degree than that usually
applied to troops forming a part of the regular establishment, I extend
to you my grateful appreciation and heartfelt thanks; and for such errors of
judgment as have characterized my administration of the battalion, I invoke
your charitable consideration as men of full age and discretion. The as
sociation with you as an organization has been to me one of the proudest,
and the termination of this relationship this day is one of the saddest, ex
periences of a lifetime. The best wishes of your battalion commander ac
company you one and all wherever the duties of your life may call you.

no Americans abroad who were in sym

inner circle that E. Burke Holladay. who
is now with C. P. Huntington at the lat
-.â¢:'!- country home. Oneida. New York,
will be appointed. Burke Holladay in tBBu
married Miss Carrie D. Huntington, niece
of C. P Huntington and daughter of the
late Solon Huntington. The wedding took
place at C. P. Huntington's Fifth-avenue 1
residence New York. Burke Holladay Is |
the son of Samuel W. Holladay. so well ;
and favorably known to the bar of san
Francisco. The young man is an especial
favorite of C. P. Hunttngton. He is able
and popular. "Glad Hand Me" and |
Burke Holladay, acting together, would
popularize the corporation and perhaps ,
promote traffic. .; : . , , >
Burke Holladav received his training in
a good law school In looking backward
he is not strained to quote:
"My only books were women's looki.
And Colly's all they taught me."
Should he become the head of the law
department he would go there with the
prestige of his uncle-in-law"s Power to
sustain him. He will be in San Francisco
again early in October.
Etecei t events indicate that the Hunt
ington power in the affairs of the corn- j
pan v will Increase henceforth rather than
diminish. He Is now recognized as the
moving spirit behind the syndicate which
Is conducting the negotiations to purchase
the Crocker Interests in the railroad.
"When Jinncs fryer was in San Francisco
last April much of the talk about his
presence being necessary to the reorgani
zation was mere pretenseâ a blind, me
Fieps for the acquisition of the Crocker
stock were then taken. There is no as- .
surance yet that the deal is finished, but
the Insiders are reasonably certain that
the Speyer syndicate is acting as the
agent of C. P. Huntington. The Jewish
capitalists who are supplying Huntington
with the sinews of wstr will demand repre
sentation in the board of directors of the
corporation.
When James Speyer came out her? last
April he was on a mission to appraise the
value of the railroad property of the
Southern Pacific system. After the ap
praisement was made the value of the
Crocker interest was ascertained by the
Bvndlcate and negotiations to purchase
were begun. The dockers agreed in writ
ing to sell at a certain figure. The option
wa* reported to the banking house of
Speyer & Co. It is not certain by any
means that the transaction is closed. The
Crockers agree to sell and the Speyers
propose to buy.
When H. E. Huntington was deposed
and George Crocker promoted to a prom
inent place in the direction of railway
affairs The Call predicted that Co Ills P.
Huntington was nursing a surprise for
the unwary. C. P. Huntington is a crafty
old fox. His ideas of higher education
may not command popular commendation,
but when it comes to the performance or
smooth tricks along the line of practical
education in dealing with the ambitions
and vanities of mankind he deserves to
rank as a professor. Perhaps Herrin
fooled him last winter, but he will fool
Krrrln before next summer.
Every one familiar with the inside his
tory and the ancient personal feuds of
the corporation knows that C. P. Hunt
ington entertains no fondness for the
Crocker*. From the Huntington stand- i
point Charles Crocker was endured and
the Crocker boys were tolerated. The
leopard does not change his spots, and the
Huntington does not forget his tricks.
George Crocker v.as not promoted in good
faith to pacify conflicting Interests or
promote tna popularity of the road, not
withstanding the people of California, who
cherish a filing of kindness rind respect
for the Crockers, welcomed the advance
ment of O<?oree Crocker to .i high place ;
in the councils of the corporation.
George and Will H. Crocker will not dis
cuss the reported transactions involving
the sale of the Crocker interests in the
railroad. Pending negotiations, the wis
dom of their silence on the subject is
obvious. When the transaction is closed
they may decide to break the j seal of
secrecy. The manner in which they refer

THE RAILROAD PLUM.
i Wide Speculation as to Who
May Succeed George
Crocker.
In spite of the reticence maintained by
! Speyer, Crocker and all those most in
timately concerned, the big deal in rail
road securities is taken as a fact and tis
the one absorbing topic of conversation
along Montgomery street and everywhere
else that -brokers and railroad men con
gregate. - ; : . ': ; Â'...'.
Notwithstanding the fact that not one
.-: they>rleipals'or their agents has as yet
s^aidf anything-; which could "possibly be
I construed into either an admission or a
denial' of the" truth of the report, the gen-'
I eral opinion seems to be that the big
transfer is now under way and that C. P.
Huntington is the power behind the pur
chasing throne. . â¢'."- . r,v
j This belief does not seem to be produc
j tive of /any great amount of jubilation.
It mean* that, the Huntington wishes will
be the undisputed policy of the Southern
Pacific-Company^ and those wishes have
been so often demonstrated in the past
I that 'the people of California know now
' little they have, to expect from any con
. cern In which the aged financier is the
dominant power.
The reasons which have led up to this
deal constitute a matter of considerable
- speculation. Some gay that George
Crocker has no taste for railroading, and
; as his opinions of the business are shared
â  by the, balance 91' the family they decided
â  to get out as soon as an opportunity pre
â  sented itself. Others say that C. P. Hunt
'â  ingtun has carried his animosity toward
the founder of the Crocker family past
, i the grave and has visited upon the chil
: dren the hate he had for their father to
! such an extent that the position of George
, | Crocker us second vice president has been
. i made as unpleasant as it well could be,
I ami he. finding that he whs little more
i than a. cipher when it came to the exer
i cisc of any of the prerogatives of his posl
i ! tion, decided to get out of a place which
â  was only a continual source of humilia
tion to him. â¢ . â¢ â¢ -Â»;>:.?.:>:
An it is generally conceded that liunt
', ington-is the man behind Bpeyer, curiosity
i ia rife to know Who will succeed to the
I ofllce of second vice president. Many
! seem to think that the robe will fall on
H. E. Huntington, who they say stands
; wtll with the head of the company and
i has been taking particular pains to tit
himself for some such place, when ques
> tioned about this matter yesterday Mr.
; Crocker refused to discuss it in any way
! whatever, and J. C. Stubbs was hardly
more communicative. Said Mr. Stubbs:
"If Mr. Crocker has sold out his stock,
and I don't know that he has, It does not
follow that he will resign his office in the
company. I suppose he has many other
I interests in the company besides those
represented by his shares, and it would
not be, surprising if he continued to be
1 associated with its management. In any
( Me it would not" be probable that a
change would occur before the next an
nual meeting of the directors, and that is
far enough off to give you newspaper
: sharps plenty of time in which to con
struct theories." '"'..*â â Â£.
This is all that the suave third vice
president would say.
There are some wise ones, however, who
generally know a thing or two, and they

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 22, 1899.
ORANGE FREE STATE
IN SYMPATHY WITH BOERS
President Steyn Makes a Most Sig=
nificant Speech at an Impor=
tant Session of the
Volksraad,
J President Steyn and Prominent Leaders of the Orange
â¦ Free State.
BL.OEMFONTEIN, Orange Free. ,
State, Sept. 21.â The Volksraad met to- I
day with a full attendance. President ;
Steyn read a carefully prepared speech.
After welcoming the Burghers he ex
pressed regret that the relations be
tween Great Britain and the Transvaal ;
. had become strained. The members,
he said, were aware of the meeting <>i
Sir Alfred Milner and President Kruger
at Bloemfontein when President Kru
ger made proposals, which, although
refused by the British commissioner
were unanimously considered through
out the Orange Free State to be ex- j
ceedingly fair.
Proceeding to review the negotiations
President Steyn said the Transvaal had
been decoyed by the British diplomatic .
agent at Pretoria, Conyngham Greene, j
and he "practically accused the impe
rial Government of a breach of faith.
He said he was disinclined to advise
the Transvaal Government to accept
the latest British demands. The.pres- j
ent critical Btate of affairs < ould not be
a matter of indifference to the Orange
Free State, which was bound by treaty
to afford assistance to. the Transvaal
and he had, therefore, convened the ;
Volksraad to decide what attitude i
should be taken.
"There is nothing," declared the
President, â¢'that warrants war or an j
attack on the Transvaal. Such differ- !
i ences as exist can be solved by arblua
j tion. War would be an insult to re- j
â  ligion and civilization."
In conclusion President Steyn said
I he would take this opportunity of lay
ing certain draft laws before the Volks
raad for consideration, praying God to
give the members strength to pass reso
lutions not only conducive to peace and
; prosperity, but also in the interest of
i their beloved State.
Immediately after the speech Presi
dent Steyn asked the Volksraad to k<>
into secret session, which was agreed
! to unanimously.
LONDON, Sept. 21.â While the Dre
cise result of the secret, session of the
Kaad of the Orange Free State is not
yet known here, President Steyn's
; speech at the opening of th' 1 session is
I regarded as an almost infallible indi
j cation of the attitude which the Free
' State will take.
Commenting from this point of view,
; the London morning papers are all tm
! pressed with the added gravity of the
i situation and murmurs are beginning
| to be heard regarding the dilatoriness
of the Government in getting troops
forward. The military men are said to
be impatient. They assert that every
, thing is ready and that they are only
| watting for orders.
It is recognized that the attitude of
the Orange Free State makes the orijr
' inal estimate* baÃed upon Dutch neu-
I trallty too small. Evidently a much
larger force will be required.
The Government is faced with some
thing like a dilemma. The leader of
I the opposition has publicly denounced
the precipitancy of the Colonial Office
; in forcing on a conflict. Therefore Mln
' isters are disinclined to convoke Par
i liament. If, on the other hand, so large
i an expenditure as the apparent atti
i tude of the Orange Free State would
: involve should become necessary, the
â  Government would be obliged to sum
mon Parliament in order to get ade
quate supplies. It is understood that
the money question accounts for the
dribbling manner in which the troops
i are being forwarded.
German military experts realizing the
1 seriousness of the campaign before
Great Britain are commenting with as
tonishment upon the fact that England
is so behind hand in her preparations.
i In Berlin it is also believed that Dr.
, Leyds is acting as President Kruger's
] evil genius and that he is leading him
I by reports that he is likely to get sym
pathy, if not assistance, from some of
the European powers.
No member of the Cape Cabinet was
! present at the meeting of the Afrikan
-1 der members of thrt Cape Parliament
j yesterday.
A dispatch from Pretoria announces
I that arms continue to be served to the
i burghers.
CAPE TOWN, Sept. 21.â Sir John
I Gordon Spriggs, leader of the opposi
! tion in the Cape House of Assembly.
! and former Premier and Treasurer of
Cape Colony, in an interview to-day
i said:
"I have no doubt that a portion of
the population of the colony would be
actively anti-British in the event of a
war with the Transvaal. I do not an
ticipate a rising, but some of the young
land impulsive Afrikanders would prob
ably show their sympathy by joining
the Boer forces. In my judgment the ;
proceedings at to-day's meeting of i
Afrikander members of the Cape Par- j
liaincnt were njost injudicious. No i
mention was made of any sympathy i
with those who would suffer while j
fighting on the British side. It is im- j
possible that those who are doing their
best to upheld British authority should
conceive anything in the nature of a
retirement fiorn the position adopted
by the imperial Government. Any stl*h
weakness would be fatal to the future
maintenance of British authority in
South Africa."
Inferring to the speech of Sir Wilt
liarn Vcniun Harrourt last evening in â¢
New Tredegar, England. Sir John said
tu> considered it "ill-advised" and "in
judicious," especially at the present
juncture. In his opinion, Harcourt'd
assertion that Great Britain could not
claim general sovereignty in the Trans
vaal when she had only partial suzer
ainty would do more than anything else
to encourage disaffection.
"I would remind the British public."
paid Sir John, 'that Sir "William Ver
non Harcourt was a mpmher of the
Government really responsible for all
the pit-sent troubles in South Africa
Blnce 1881."
PRETORIA, Sept. 21.â General Jou
bcrt, th" Boer oommander-in-ehief. Is
quoted a? savins in an interview:
"The situation is serious. Probably
the heaviest fighting: would occur on
the Natal border. The British are like
ly to attempt to invade the Transvaal
by way of the Van Relnan Pass."
Urgent messages are reaching the
Raad from members, who are demand
ing authority for the Boers to mass at
strategic points.

METHODISTS MEET
AT LOS ANGELES
Conference of Southern
District.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES. Sept. 21.â Bishop E. X.
Ninde presided at to-day's - .session of the
annual conference of the M. E church of
the southern district of California. He
was early commended for the rapidity
with whirh he executed the objects of the
session. The question of life insurance
caused a lively discussion.
The committee oh preachers' aid society
work recommended the following amend
ment to the constitution: "That the rate
of contribution by the preachers be
changed from one-half of one per cent to
one per cent of the salary received for the
current year, including- the rental of the
parsonage and receipts for the missionary
society.
"That the disbursement be to the claim
ants who have paid their assessments to
this society and In proportion to the num
ber of their annual payments.
"When a contributor ceases to be a
member of this conference he shall re
ceive back the whole amount of his pay
ment to this fund and shall not be longer
a claimant upon it."
It transpired that only sixteen members
of the conference arc paying into the an
nuity fund, which is distinct from other
funds handled by the aid society for tho
assistance of the superannuated ministers.
The report from the committee included
the following comments on the work of
the year:
"We point with satisfaction to our great
publishing houses. Our property Is secure.
Our credit is unquestioned. Every year
we issue millions of pages of religious lit
erature to help forward the kingdom of
Christ and distributf a handsome fortune
among the needy preachers of our church.
"The profits of the past year are not so
large as could be desired, yet they are
creditable.
"We regret to announce receipts of the
Episcopal fund for the beginning of the
year have been pxhaustcd and the year
closes wiih a defk-it of $3115 63.
"We earnestly urge upon the attention
of our annual conferences the duty of
meeting in full thflr obligations to this
claim. The apportionments continue at
the same rate as hitherto, namely, I'+ per
cent for the claim for ministerial support,
and under the law of the church the re
ceipts for Bishops, presiding elders and
pastors must be shared pro rata."

LOST MILLIONS
IN WHEAT DEAL
Failure of a Big Firm
in Chicago Causes a
Slight Panic.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CHICAGO. Sept. 21.â The firm of Bar
rett, Farnum & Co., a wealthy and influ
ential Board of Trade concern here, failed
to-day. It had heavily sold short during
the past three days, plunging in the ex
pectation that the New York stock panic
would result in a break in wheat. The
shortage of the firm Is variously esti
mate! at from 4,000,000 to 5,000,000 bushels
of the December option.
It was noticed yesterday that the com
pany was a heavy buyer of wheat '
In the local pit, taking about 1,000.000
in an effort to cover. The price held
firm, with a strength that puzzled the
theorists in view of the bearish tone of
news'. Again this morning the brokers
representing the firm were busy on the
curb and in the pit. but all efforts proved
of no avail. The crash came at 11 o'clock,
when the deals wont into the clearing
house. Barrett. Farnum & Co. in a has
tily scrawled notice announced the in
ability of fhe firm to fulfill its contracts.
Then the scene in the pit took on the
shape of a panic. The December option
had opened at 71? i to 71% c and the mar
ket slid quietly off under sales against
calls to ilUc. At this figure Barrett, Far
num & Co. renewed their efforts to re
cover. The price jumped fractionally
to 73c. Then came the announcement of
the abrogation of the firm's contracts,
and the scramble to get out from under.
December declined to 71^c without even
an effort at recovery.
Meanwhile Messrs. Barrett. Farnum &
Co. had closed their doors. James
Walker, manager of the concern, when
seen, declared that he was as much sur
prised as any one at the suspension, and
gave as his opinion that the firm would
be able to resume business, inasmuch as
the subsiding of the panic had left wheat
fluctuating narrowly.
"It is impossible to say just what the
liabilities are," said Mr. Walker, "or the
as&ets either, for that matter. But with
wheat at the present figure I believe that
thf ship is not at the bottem yet, but
just a little water-logged."
Frank Logan, a prominent broker, de
clared that the shortage could only be
approximated, but was probably 4,000,
--000 bushels of wheat.

ish sympathy in his behalf he wrung
the correspondent's hand and showed
the deepest emotion. His health, the
correspondent says, is far from satis
factory. He ate meat yesterday for the
first time.
At present he speaks little of past
events. He says: "I have forgiven, but
I cannot forget." and he intends to de
vote himself to proving his innocence.
When that has been accomplished he
will only ask to be allowed to spend the
remainder of his tiim- with his loved
ones, far from the busy world.
His delight at everything on the
journey was that of a man returning
from the dead to the world he loved.
The affection and solicitude of his
brother are touching to see. His phy

a few expressions of disappointment on
the part of the people who endeavored

WASHINGTON, Sept. 21.â The War
Department issued a general order in re
gard to th* examination of officers of the
volunteer army, an important provision
nf which is that vacancies of second

and its report will be forwarded with the
recommendation of the commanding gene
ral, for action by the President.
"Promotions " in the volunteer regi
ments will be made within each regi
ment and by seniority. All vacancies of
Becond lieutenants will be filled from the
ted men of th^ regiment on the rer

ANOTHER TANGLE IN
THE BATEMANS' AFFAIRS
AUDITOR WELLS WELL MAKE
NO MORE PAYMENTS.
Another entanglement, this one amount
ing to SI2.OCKi 79. has developed in
the already badly complicated affairs of
the new Hall of Justice. During the last
two weeks suits, injunctions and notices
of money due, against the Bateman
Bros., the contractors, have been piling
up on the desks of Auditor Wells and
Chief Clerk Russell of the Board of Su
pervisors, and neither of those officials
is quite clear as to the status of the case
at the present day.
Yesterday the Pacific Rolling Mills
Company sent Attorney W. S. Goodfel
low to the Auditor to notify him to
pay out no moneys to any of the credi
tors of the Katemans until its claim of
$12.000 79 had been satisfied. To back its
notification, Attorney Goodfellow dis
played an assignment made to the com
pany by the Batemans under date of
August 18, 1597, of all moneys due the con
tractors from the city up to the amount
of the contractors' bill with the company
for structural steel at frfa cents per pound.
That assignment apparently gives the
Pacific Rolling Mills first call on all the
cash the Bateman Bros, have coming,
and Auditor Wells will refuse to make
any payments until the matter has been
settled by the courts or by agreement
between the attorneys for the different
parties.
The claim of Cahlll & Hall for $13,400
for elevators, against the payment of
which Batsman Bros, enjoined the Audi
tor, was compromised, and yesterday Mr.
Wells made the first payment due,
amounting to $4500.

dence thfi Judge held him to answer be

It was shown in evidence that about a
years ago Kelly attempted to shoot his
wife while they lived in Alameda. but was
prevented by a neighbor. They separated,
and she went to her parents in Honolulu,
takinjr their child with her. Prior to
August 2<"i, the day of the shooting, Kelly
had Been her after her return two or
three times, demanding the custody of
the child.
He lay in wait for her on August 26,
and as she stepped off the car at Third
and Brannan streets, he rushed up behind
lxr, and placing the revolver against her
"'â 'â lf pulled the trigger. It snapped
twice, but the third shot entered her
neck. T. H. Tibbetts the molorman of
the car, jumped off and struck him on the
head with the controller bar, knocking
him out. Dr. Joseph W. Henry of St

ARRIVAL OF THE WIZARD
OF WIRELESS TELEGRAPH
Signor Marconi Comes to This Country to Su
perintend the Reporting of the Yacht
Races for The Call.
NEW YORK, Sept. 21.â Signor Mar
coni, who comes to this country for the
first time by arrangements with the
Herald and The Call to demonstrate by
actual working the practicability of
wireless telegraphy, arrived on the
Cunard steamer Aurania to-day.
When the passengers began filing:
down the gangway from the Aurania
few of the many who were on the pier
recognized in the youthful â almost
boyish-lookingâ man the bearer of the
name that has become distinguished in
electrical circles. Signor Marconi looks
like a student, and possesses a peculiar
semi-abstracted air that characterizes
men who devote their days to study
and scientific experiment. He was ac
companied by William Goodbody, one
of the London directors of. the Wireless
Telegraph Company, and' by Charles E.
Rickard, W. W. liradfleld and William
Densham. skilled operators who have
been engaged in experiments in the
English Channel and who will be In
charge of the instruments and send
messages to The Call and Herald dur
ing the yacht race.
On the Aurania also came the appar
atus which will be used, transmitters,
receivers, batteries, etc. â all the apDli
ances of a telegraph outfit with the ex
ception of wires.
Signor Marconi chatted very freely
about what had been done in the devel
opment of wirtless telegraphy and what
he hoped to accomplish in the future.
He was very enthusiastic over the idea
of reporting the yacht races, and his
confidence over the success of the work
is firrfL
"We will be able to send details of the
racing to New York as accurately and
almost as quickly as you could tele
phone them." he said. "The distance
involved is nothing, nor will hills or
buildings interfere with communiica
tion. In our experiments carried on In
England we sent messages over much
greater distances than we will have to
contend with in this case. I have con
ducted many tests from moving vessels
to stationary and moving receiving
points with complete satisfaction.
"The most remarkable, perhaps, were
made during the recent British naval
maneuvers. The Admiralty is very
deeply interested in the subject, and
asked me to install my system on board
three ships of the 'fleet that was en

THE LIGHTING BILLS.
Supervisor Perrault Notifies the Com
pany That the Provisions of the
One-Twelfth Act Will Be
Obeyed.
*-
After to-night San Francisco will be in
darkness for the remaining nights of the
; month. Chairman Perrault of the Super
i visors' Finance Committee received notice
to that effect yesterday, after he had sent
to the gas company a communication
setting forth the determination of that
committee to obey the provisions of the
one-twelfth act.
Under the new tax levy, the figures for
which were suggested by Mayor Phelan,
\ adopted by the Supervisors in conformity
| with their pledges to the people to keep
within the dollar limit, the appropriation
for street lighting for the fiscal year
which began July 1 last Is $240,000. The
one-twelfth act provides for an equal
division of every appropriation for each
| month in the year. This would make the
apppropriatlon for street lighting just
$20,000, a month.
In looking over, the bills for street
lighting, Chairman Perrault discovered
I that both in July and August they had
â  exceeded that amount. The bill for July
i was $23,057 78 and that for August $20,
--i 930 33. .He decided at once that it was
; time to notify the gas company that they
should trim their lamps accordingly.
He immediately sent a communication to
President J. B. Crockett of the San Fran
j cisco Gas and Electric Company that that
i company would have to get along this
! month with $16,01 i 89, as the difference
between that amount and the $20,000 that
could be rightfully appropriated for
September under the one-twelfth act was
necessary to pay for the excess of gas
used in July and August.
The receipt of this communication
! caused quite a flurry in the gas company's
! office. A number of men were set at the
task of figuring up the gas bill to date,
and toward evening their work was com
pleted and the figures submitted to Presi
dent Crockett. He found that the con
sumption of gas and electric light for
street purposes 'had, even at this, time in
the month, nearly burned up the sixteen
thousand odd dollars, and he so wrote, In
forming Chairman Perrault, adding that,
under existing conditions, the company
would shut oft' its supply for the present
month after to-night.
The reign of darkness will begin Satur
day night, and for seven nights there
after there will be darkness and fog, in
which, murder and arson can lurk, in
which thugs and crooks of every descrip
tion can operate -.ln safety, defying the
police. It is a state of affairs that has
long been threatened but has never been
really expected in the flourishing city of
San Francisco, so prosperous that it is im
possible just now to secure skilled labor
to do the work of business and manufac
ture on hand. People who go. on the
street after dark for the remaining nights
in September do so at -their own risk. In
the present unsettled condition of the
city, with Its thousands of strangers, the
danger cannot be magnified. It exists on
every hand. * "

WILL BE ASKED TO
CLOSE THE NYMPHIA
Chief of Police Lees to Be Visited

To-Day.
Father Oaraher, Father Redehan, Re\-s.
Drs. Slocum, I'rmy and Wilson will visit
the Chief of Police this mornins: and ap
peal to him to close the Hotel Nymphia.
They will base their request on the ver
dict of guilty found hy a jury in Judge
Gfaham's court against the directors of
the nefarious resort. Should the Chief of
the Police Department refuse to take ac
tion in the matter he will bring down on
his grey head the wrath of the residents
of the North Beach district.
John J. Barrett, who so ably repre
sented the residents of the North Beach
district, is of the opinion that the place
should have been immediately closed by
the police. His opinion is concurred in
by other lawyers and a great deal of sur
prise has been evinced by citizens Inter
gaged in defending the coast of Eng
land. The scouting cruiser Juno and
the flagship Alexandria were two of the
three equipped. I was on board* the
flagship, and during the cruise I did not
get much sleep. Scouts were directed
to report every vessel sighted and send
a description of her, which direction
she was steering and everything about
her. They also reported routine mat
ters to the admiral. Between midnight
and 6 o'clock in the morning we fre
quently transmitted as many as two
hundred messages. Except for these
reports the admiral had no definite idea
where his scouts were, nor would the
scouts have had of the fleet.
"The distance between the two. of
course, varied, but the system worked
well whether it wae short or long.
Prom the scout not a trace of the
smoke from the funnels of the thirty
warships of the fleet could be seen, yet
the instrument down in the stateroom
was clicking out orders from the ad
miral every few minutes.
"Finally the Juno sighted the vessels
she was looking for, and a message con
taining this information was sent by
the operator on board. Eighty miles
distant Sir Compton Domville. on the
Alexandria, received the news, which
enabled him to outmaneuver the
enemy's fleet, bring the convoy in safe
ly and win the mimic naval contest.
"You see, the same conditions which
obtained In these tests will prevail dur
ing the yacht races, with a decrease in
the distance to be covered. We can
follow the racers at full speed, and
messages sent out from the tall Dole
will find their way as swiftly as a flash
of lightning to the pole at the receiving
station. On the sending ship after the
message has been dispatched we would
receive a code word and know that it
was received properly and that it was
accurate. Then we would be ready to
send another message.
"Should the message be unintelligible
to the operator at the receiving instru
ment or should the Morse characters
be confused, instead of receiving the
code word to go ahead on the sending
ship we would get a query on the pre
vious message, which would be re
peated in whole or in part, as the case
might be.
"Another thing we have found out is
that mountains, high buildin.es, steel
masts, etc., do not stop communication.
We were able while in Bantry Bay to
talk with a ship lying many miles from
est<Â»d in its suppression that Chief Lees
has withheld action.
A mass meeting will be hpld by the cit
izens of the North Beach district on Mon
day evening next. Resolutions will be
passed commending the jury for its
honest and courageous action in declaring
the directors of the infamous place guilty
of the charge brought aealnst them.

Again, a very valuable point is that fog I

times the instruments have appeared to
work better in thick weather. The cur

counted. With a pole sufficiently high,
a message can practically be sent any

attempting to communicate between !
New York and Chicago, but I do not \
think I shall make that experiment. I ;
may, however, try it."
It is interesting to note that Signor
Marconi did not begin his experiments [
until 1895, when he began to erect poles â 
and endeavored to establish communi- :
cation between various parts of his
father's estate near Bologna in Itaiv. '
In 1896 he arrived in England and after
working- in conjunction with W. J.
Preece, then chief electrician of the
British Postoffice, he gave a demon
stration of the capabilities of the sys
tem during the volunteer evolutions on
Salisbury Plain, and also in the British
Channel.
A more ambitious experiment fol
lowed and wireless telegraphy became
a fact and not a theory only.
Captain George O. Squier of the
United States Signal Corps and Leon
ard Wildman of the United States Vol- :
unteer Signal Corps greeted Signor
Marconi upon his arrival. After the
yacht races are over the War and Navy j
departments intend to have Marconi
conduct experiments for them. '
The big steamer Ponce, upon which
Signor Marconi will direct the report
ing of the yacht races, is now at her
pier in Brooklyn. The wireless tele
graph apparatus will be installed in a
few days and tests made before the ,
races to insure perfect working.
On board the Grande Duchesse pre
parations for putting the instruments
and pole in place have been bc-gun un
der the direction of W. J. Clark. When
she arrives from Boston everything
will be in readiness. From both these
fast steamers as they follow the races
wireless telegraphy will flash the story
of the contest, and those on board, after
watching the races and seeing the ac
counts being sent over the wire can
experience again the pleasure and ex- I
citement of the struggle by reading the
accounts.

MAXWELL
TWEEDIE MILL
WAS A FAKE
Los Angeles Lad Wins, but
All Bets Are De
clared Off.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
STOCKTON, Sept. 21.â Lovers of ring
fighting were rudely shocked to-nignt
when Cocker Tweedle, the Australian,
was knocked out by Sammy Maxwell of
Los Angeles in the opening of the second
round. The audience, that only partly
. Hied the Avon Theater, cried "Fake!"
and so It looked to a large number.
Charley Oliver, one of the club man-
agers, was referee, and declared all beta
off on the ground that it was a fake.
[*weedie had his right hand up to his face
guarding when Maxwell got in a right
hook on the chin and the Australian went
down', but did rot fall as limply as "thÂ«
experts thought he should. When helped
to his corner he seemed dazed a bit, but j
with the exception of the San Francisco
fellows; who were backing Maxwell as j
one of their own, the decision was ac
cepted as right. Oliver' afterward an
nounced that the club would not pay
either end of the purse, and stuck to his
decision declaring bets Off.
Tim MeGrath, who trained Sharkey,
was second for Tweedie. and made pub
lic announcement thai if it was a fake he
did not know it. and regretted that he
came here, how. The affair has ex
cited sportdotn. but the majority who
paid for admission agree that it was a
fake.
The prelim inary was between Ben Max
well of Stockton and another colored man
from San Francisco named Henry Lewis.
The fight was easily won by the former.

SHAMROCK'S
OWNER WAS
NERVOUS
Because of a Rain the Yacht
Did Not Go Out
for a Spin.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Sept. 21.â Sir Thomas
Lipton is not availing himself of every
chance to test the Shamrock. She has
not been here since August 17. and dur
ing that time has had but nine trials at
sea, and even of this small number, only
four can be considered as fair tests.
There was an opportunity to-day when,
if she had sought the open, she could
have searched out any latent weakness
of spar or rigging. An eighteen- knot
breeze was smothering the sea with
white caps, and while not too heavy, the
wind was strong enough to have offered
an excellent test of strength. * ~
That the Shamm. k !a not without her
weaknesses w:.> -'. iwn a few days
when her metal ga.fl gave way in a
moderate wind. A wind such as waa
blowing yesterday might have carried
something else away, ami just that sort
of wind may be about when the races
r the <up are on. Some I - things
wen pointed oui to Sir Thomas on hoard
his yacht Krin. He listened with deep
attention, and showed a bit â  f n tvous
when it was recalled to him that
lolumbla had been given upward of
forty trials in all sorts .if weather, and
that those who are to sail the cup de
fender have been made by this practice
thoroughly familiar with the craft. Evi
dently realizing that Â»v""i time was being
lost, Sir Thomas sent a message to -Mr.
Fife, who was on board the anchored
Shamrock.
"The Shamrock will not go out to-day,"
was the reply thai <:uu<- back. Ii was
understood that th* reason for not going
out was because of the rain, which
would have wet the sails and might have
stretched them out of lit. But the Sham

are worth about 160,009. The mainsail in
use to-daj was lighter than yesterday's,
which has been taken apart at the Her
reshofl sail loft. There has been some
misunderstanding nbout the Columbia's

that the new steel mast could not be

ALLISON'S GROUSE CASE.
Game Commissioners Angry Oye,r a
Misrepresentation of Facts.
The Fish and Game Commissioners are
very much annoyed at the published mis
representation concerning the dismissal of
the case of D. E. Allison, who was arrest
ed for violating the game law by having
grouse ir. his possession out of season.
The statement complained .of .was that
L. M. .Lewi*, curator of the Academy of
Sciences, had testified that the birds were
not gTOUse,'. but sagehens. It is well
known that the sagehen is of the grouse
family, the same as a carrier pigeon is a
member of the pigeon family. Scientist
Lewis testified that the birds, offered as
evidence of the offense were grouse, no
matter what hunters called them.
The dismissal of the commission mer
chant, Allison, was made by Police Judge
Graham on the ground that the Accused
did not know the 'difference between
grouse and sagehens, buying the game for
the latter, and that there was an ab
sence of intent to do evil. The Game
Commissioners take the stand that ignor
ance of the law is no' excuse for the of
fense, 'â

THIS four-year-old prm of Bayswater Wilkes is one of the greatest green products cf the trotting track that ever

Tin- bay horse won again easily at Sacramento, but in the 2:15 pace at Stockton on Tuesday met defeat in a long

Illegal Fishers Caught
Word was received at the office of the
Fish and Game Commission yesterday
that Deputy Cross had captured two men
near Vallejo for catching undersized
striped bass. Although the bay is full of
fish of this kind welching over three
pounds, the minimum weig-ht. still the up
river fishermen persist in taking fish un
der size. Tons of these food fish have been,
confiscated this season, but the fishers
take chancos, well knowing 1 that to be
caught means punishment amounting to
more than the value of the fish.
McFARLANE,
WELL PLAYED,
LEFT AT POST
Many Inclined to Blame
Jockey Tullett for Not
Getting Away.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
STOCKTON, Sept. 2Kâ A card of five
running races and a trot brought out the
best crowd up to. date at the Stockton
Fair this afternoon. The grand stand
was filled and the lawn was.jammed with
people when the second heat of the trot
was called. The public was hungry for
running races and the people were given
some good sport but little chance of win
ning any money. Four out of five favor
ites, on which 2 to 3, 1 to 3. 1 to 4 and 1
to 5 were given by the syndicate book,
were returned winners, and as few put
down a bet on the successful horses at
such odds the bookmakers quit with
about all of the money. ?>:'â 'â â¢'..
There was a big roar because the
heavily played second choice, McFarlane,
was left at the post in the mile handicap
and many are not chary about asserting
that it was Tullett' fault, as he appeared
to make no effort to get the bay away.
An assistant lashed the horse, but the
boy held him so he could not even take
after the flying bunch. He turned him
around and came back to the start.
Hank was made favorite in the first
heat of the 2:13 trot, but Fanadma. won
so handily she was banked on for the
second and final trial and took .it in a
drive from Azalia. Tres Jolie and Ojai
v romped home in the two half-mile dashes,
while Alaria won the six-furlong event
under a double wrap. Twinkle Twink
took the mile handicap, after McFarlane
cut out of it, in very fast time for a

FOUNDER'S DAY AT
THE LICK SCHOOL
IT IS OBSERVED WITH APPRO
PRIATE EXERCISES.
Irving M. Scott Makes a Short Ad
dressâWilmerding School Will
Be Opened January 1.
Yesterday was founder's day at the
Lick School of Mechanical Arts, and the
occasion was celebrated in a manner that
would have met with the hearty approval
of the generous but practical philanthro
pist responsible for the existence of the
Institution had he been alive and present.
The exercises were exceedingly brief and
simple.
At 10 a. m. the regents' committee of the
Wllmerding School, consisting of E. A.
Denicke, Albert Miller and A. S. Hallidle
the latter being also a member of the
Lick board), made a thorough inspection
of th^ school. The board was accompa
nied on its rounds of the institution by
President Horace Davis, Secretary James
S. Bunnell. Trustee John O. Earl Princi
pal George A. Merrill of the Lick school.
Manager Schwartz of the Wilmerding
School and Irving M. Scott. Every pupil
was at his or her desk, bench, forge or
lathe and the visitors were given an ex
cellent opportunity to form a compre
hensive idea of the practical working of
the school.
As the visiting officials left the work
shops a blast of the whistle summoned
the pupils from their work, and they as
sembled in the lecture room, where the
formal exercises were to be held. Pres
ident Davis introduced I. M. Scott, and in
doing so paid the latter a neat tribute,
based on the marvelous performance of
that wonderful batth-ship. the Oregon.
Mr. Scott spoke briefly and earnestly. He
said the credit which had been earned by
the Oregon wa* due to the fact that the
men who built the ship had not only lived
up to their contract but had taken
a personal pride in their work, and
the praise was therefore due to them.
Mr Scott told of his first meeting with
James Lick. He found him eating his
frugal lunch, seated at the end of his
workbench in his shop at Alviso, the same
bench that is now one of the cherished
possessions of the school. The speaker
urged the pupils to emulate the example
of the life of their benefactor. This con
cluded the exercises, and the pupils re
turned at once to their work and studies.
Mr. Scott was enthusiastic over the
work of the youthful cabinet and pattern
makers, and told Foreman Dewitt that he
wanted two of the young men at the
Union Iron Works immediately.
The regents' committee of the Wilmerd
ing School held a short meeting in the
Lick School during the afternoon and de
cided to open the school on the ftr-st of
the coming year. The following list
of instructors submitted by Manager
Schwartz will be recommended for ap
pointment at the next meeting of the
board of regents: Wood carving, Daniel
M. Biggs; cabinet making, James A. Lin
dervllle; blacksmithing, Louis Llndeburg;
algebra, physics, etc., Arthur W. Gray,
assistant professor of physics at the
University of California; art work,
clay modeling, etc., Felix Peano of
the Lick School. The first two named
are foremen in the Davenport Brass
Works In East Cambridge, Mass.,
and had charge of the interior work in
the 11.000,000 Vanderbilt mansion in New
York. Mr. Schwartz says there will be
accommodations for 150 pupils when the
school opens, and 250 later on. The Wil
merding School will be devoted to the
teaching of the building trades, while the
Lick School will continue to turn out
machinists, etc.
Friends of Animals.
The regular monthly meeting of the
trustees of the San Francisco Society for
the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals was
held yesterday. The following is a synop
sis of Secretary' C. B. Holbrook's report:

ed, 251; prosecuted, 16; animals taken from

While big Ed Corrignn snarl? and growls
; like an enraged beast at bay, the om-e
\ mighty Western empire over which be
i formerly ruled with an iron hand ;.
--j rent asunder. Baffled in his attempt to
j corner the California racing same, he
i sought to play a trump card and have his
! most formidable rival, the Cali:

ganization is mm nosed of many of
the representative turfrren of the
Middle Western and Southern States,
among them betng Joseph A.

and Captain J. H. Rees, all well
! known to [oca! followers of the turf. Cor
rigan undoubtedly congratulated himself
that he would be "right at home." and
attended fully prepared to twist the lion's
tail until he was good.
At the close of the meeting yesterday
Thomas If. Wiiiiiims Jr.. president of the
Oakland association, was in receipt of a
telegram which stated that a motion had
been made before the members in session
M tp OUtiaw all Western tracks which com
menced winter racing before Novembi r

the telegram said, and a committee ap-

could be amicably settled.

j called "racetrack war."
CHICAGO. Sept. 21.â Discussion of rac
ing rules occupied the attention of the
delegates to the American Turf Congress
to-day and a number of important
changes were made. Rule IS, in whi^h.
any person or horse ruled off the track
by a running association, for fraud, was
ruled off the tracks of members of the
American Turf Association, was amended
to read as follows:
"Every person or horse expelled or ruled
off by any reputable running association
or by the American or National Trotting
Association shall stand ruled off the
courses of the members of this congress
during the continuance of such expulsion.
"Any association that shall knowingly
allow any ruled-off person or horse to
participate in its racing shall be out
lawed."
Another rule adopted by the congress
was that no person against whom there
are arrears shall be granted a license as
a trainer or jockey. A rule was adopted
by the congress that hereafter no em
ployer shall get tho money won by any
jockey bound to him by contract who
shall win riding outside mounts.
Much time- was devoted to the troubles
existing between the racing clubs of Cal
ifornia. The Pacific Coast Jockey Club
and the Western Turf Association have
been unable to agree on the dates for
holding thoir races. The congress
qided to allow the clubs to find a solution
of the problem.
The election of officers for the ensuing
year resulted as follows:
President, W. F. Schulte, Louisville;
vice president. James Howard, Chicago;
treasurer, O. L. Bradley, Lexington. Ky.;
secretary. K. C. Hopper, Covingtnn. Ky.
A permanent office of the congress will
be opened in Louisville and the next
meeting of the congress will be held in
that cfty.
HIS SKULL WAS BROKEN
William Carr Was Sent From the Be
ceiving Hospital as a Natural
Cause Case.
Autopsy Surgeon Zabala made an
autopsy yesterday upon the body of Wil
liam Carr, who died at the City Receiving
Hospital last Wednesday night, appar
ently of alcoholism, and found that < 'hit's
skull had been fractured. There is no
clew to the planner in which he was in
jured.
But the most surprising part of the af
fair is that there is no clew to the manner
in which the persons in charge of the Re
ceiving Hospital avoided discovering that
their patient was suffering from a frac
tured skull. It is true that Carr was
poorly dressed, and that he had been
drinking heavily, but if more care had
been shown in Ms treatment the fracture
would have been discovered and his lifts
might have been saved by a surgical
operation.
Auxiliary to the Veterans.
The wives and lady relatives of the
Veteran Volunteer Firemen's Associa
tion of this city have formed an auxiliary
society to the veterans for the purpns, of
assisting them in their social functions.
The new society was organized last Wed
nesday night with Mrs. G. Andrews as
president and Miss Amy Hughes as re
cording secretary. After the organiza
tion the members, some fifty in number,
adopted resolutions thanking the officials,
firemen and citizens (ladles and gentle
men) of Fresno for their courteous
reception of the veterans and the ladies
who accompanied them, and assuring
them that if any come to the veterans'
headquarters they will receive a hearty
welcome. Following the business meet
ing there was an informal dance in the
headquarters at 24 Fourth street.

ST. PAUL, September 21.â A serious ac

The injured, none fatally, are: George
Tew, engineer; John feomans, engineer,
and Thomas Merrill, fireman.
The Omaha special freight train was
standing on the bridge over the Des
Moines River near Windom at about 11:30
last night, when, under what Is supposed !
was a misapprehension of orders, it was j
crashed into by another freight train i
drawn by two engines and composed of
twenty-five heavily loaded cars.
The bridge went down, carrying the
engines and part of both trains, and as :
the water in the river was but four feet
deep, the debris caught fire and heavy
damage resulted, while four men met
death in awful form.
Conductor Williams of the train which
was struck fled after the accident, after
telling conflicting stories as to its cause.

RALLIES OF REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS
REPUBLICANS OF
NEBRASKA HOLD A
CONVENTION AT OMAHA
Curing the Harmonious Proceedings
Nominations ire Made for State
Officers-Administration
Indorsed.
OMAHA, Nebr., Sept. 21.â The Repub
lican State Convention was one of the
most harmonious gatherings ever held
by the party in the State. M. B. Reese
of Lincoln was nominated for Supreme
Judge on the first ballot. L. G. McGil
ton of Omaha and William B. Ely of
Ainsworth were both nominated for re
gents of the State University on the
first ballot. Judge Reese has served
six years on the Supreme bench, retir
ing six years ago to resume the practice
of his profession. Frank C. Reavis of
Jails City as temporary chairman ad
dressed the convention and upheld the
policy of the national administration.
After the preliminary matters were
disposed of. the temporary officers hav
ing been made permanent. Major Kil
lain of the First Nebraska, who was
in the house, was called for and on his
appearance was vociferously applaud
ed. He made an earnest speech in be
half of upholding the hands of the na
tional administration in the Philippines.
The applause which punctuated his
speech was even more hearty than that
which greeted his appearance.
Senator Thurston and several others
also made speeches, but the one which
set the delegates and spectators wild
was that of Chaplain Mailey of th-.^
First Nebraska. His opening sentence
started the pandemonium of cheering.
He said he had never voted a Repub
lican ticket in his life, but he intended
this fall to vote to uphold the hands
of the administration in the Philip
pines.
The committee on resolutions report
ed and the resolutions were promptly
adopted.
On the question of foreign policy the
platform states:
We heartily indorse the wise, conserva
tive and patriotic administration of Pres
ident McKinley and congratulate the
President upon his success in dealing
with the delicate and difficult problems
arising- from our war with Spain and we
repose implicit confidence in his ability
to cope with every issue that may pre
s-ent Itself for solution in the future.
"While we deplore the insurrection in the
Philippines, yet we recognize the duties
and obligations Imposed upon oar nation
by the victory of our navy and the match
less valor of our arms, resulting: in the
treaty of Paris, which imposed upon the
President the duty of maintaining the
authority of the United States over the
territory acquired thereby, and so long as
there Is one pun pointed at an American
soldier, bo long as there Is an armed
enemy assaulting our flag, so long must
patriotic and loyal Americans uphold our
President in effecting protection, tran
quillity and peace to all who recognize our
lawful occupation.
After paying a glowing tribute to the
valor of the First Nebraska Volunteers
in the Philippines the platform deals
witn the money question as follows:
We adhere unequivocally to the gold
standard and are unalterably opposed to
the free coinage of sliver. Gold has been
our standard since i 5.34 and is now the
â tandard of every civilised and important
country in the world. Arter more than
twenty years of harmful agitation and a
campaign of extraordinary earnestness
and full discussion, the people of the
United States, by a majority of more than
500,000, decided in favor of that standard.
Our experience and present prosperity in
the amplest and fullest measure demon
strates the wisdom of that decision.

THE GRAND ARMY
MAY PARADE
Roosevelt Takes Up
Their Fight in the
Dewey Fete.
*
?p*e!a! Dispatch to The Call
NEW YORK, Sept. 21.â At General
Roe's office to-day it was said the refusal
of the Grand Army of the Republic to
take part tn the Dewey land parade was
f:nai. General Roe is not disposed to re
cede an inch from his position.
Notwithstanding General Roe's positive
statement, however, there is a possibility
that the Grand Army veterans may par
ticipate in the parade. Governor Roose
velt has taken up the fight in their be
half. To-day, speaking at the Otsega
â¢y Fair, at Cooperate wn, N. 1.. he
said:
"I transacted one piece of business to
day that may be of interest to you of the
Grand Army. I see by the press a state
ment that there had be~n some hitch in
the arrangements of the parade to meet
Dowey and I telegraphed to the major
general commanding the National Guard
of this Btate that tne Grand Army is to
have the right of position or anything it
wants in ths parade. If I can bring it
about I am going to have the heroes of
the great war occupy the foremost posi
tion. '

superior officer, and the Grand Army will
probably march in the place of honor

BOSTON. Sept. 21.â The riotous
scenes and the bitter fights between the
two factions of the Democrats in this
State, which characterized the all
night session in Music Hall here in
1896 and that at Worcester the follow
ing year, were renewed with even
greater bitterness at the annual con
vention of the State Democracy in Me
chanics' Hall to-day. There was hardly
a moment after the speeches of the
temporary and permanent presiding of
ficers were concluded when there was
quiet and harmony in any degree. At
times the entire delegations were upon
their feet, the members standing on
chairs or tables, shouting in the heat
of passion some denunciatory remarks
at the chairman or the person who was
endeavoring to speak upon the plat
form.
At these times it seemed as though
even the force of one hundred police
men in the hall would be of no avail,
so impassioned were those upon the
floor, and the climax came when at the
request of the chairman the captain
of police apneared upon the platform
and placed his hand upon Congressman
John Fitzgerald in readiness to forcibly
remove him from the platform had he
nut subsided and allowed the chairman
to address and calm the excited as
semblage.
The cause of the tumult which raged
for .nearly three hours was the ques
ti n before the body of accepting the
action of the State committee in pre
senting a list of delegates to the na
tional convention.
It was claimed by those that opposed
the idea that it was against all pre
cedent and robbed the various districts
of their constitutional rights.
The personalities which were in
dulged in were directed as much
against Congressman Fitzgerald as
against Mr. Williams, the party leader,
and hard names were called on both
sides. The final result of ail the con
fusion and discord was the overwhelm
ing passage of every motion and report
which was made by the State commit
tee and the selection of a State ticket
headed by Robert T. Paine Jr. and
John H. Mack.
The committee appointed to select the
delegates to the national convention
made its report. The delegates-at-laree
are George Fr<rd Williams. Colonel A.
C. Drinkwater, William F. McNary and
Christopher T. Callahan.
There were several attempts at dis
turbance when the motion to acceDt the
report Of this committee was out. but
they were suppressed and the chairman
declared the report adopted, and the
list of delegates stands a.= announced.
The convention then adjourned.
CRACKER COMBINE
CONSUMMATED
Seven Coast Factories
Purchased.
Â«
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SEATTLE, Sept. 21.â The promoters of
the Pacific Coast Biscuit Company have
paid $200,006 in cash as the first payment
on the purchase of seven of the principal
cracker and candy factories on the Pa
cific ('oast.
Thi:? is the consummation of the cracker
combination which was formed last spr'ug
by Eastern investors, headed by C. W.
Warner of Syracuse, N. V.. and which
became abortive owirfg to the failure of
the purchasers to supply the cash de
mands as they fell due.
Since the former deal failed the promo
ters of the Pacific Coast Biscuit Company
have been working diligently to effect a
consolidation of cracker interests on the
coast and have now apparently succeeded.
The new company starts in business
with a capital of $4,000,000. The factories
purchased are as follows: Southern (^a\l
fornia Crackor Company of Los Angeles;
Portland Cracker Company, operating ;
two factories, one at Portland and the
"ther at Seattle; the Washington Cracker
Company of Spokane, the Oregon Cracker ',
Company of Portland. Seattle Cracker and i
Candy Company of Seattle and th^ Amer- â 
ican Biscuit Company of San Francisco. '
The larger factories take part cash and '
part stock in the new organization. A
considerable sum is set aside in the plans !
of the company f ->r improvements and ex
tension of trade.

GOVERNOR LOWNDES
AND WELLINGTON ARE
NOW AT LOGGERHEADS
Demand Made for the Retirement of
the Senator from the State
Central Committee Leads
to Senous Charges,
BALTIMORE. Sept. 21.â Governor
Lowndes, who is a candidate for re
election on the Republican State ticket,
has demanded the resignation of United
States Senator George L. Wellington
as chairman, of the Republican State
Central Committee. This step is the
outcome of the work of the State Cen
tral Committee yesterday in appointing
committees on finance and on the con
duct of the coming campaign, which
practically deprived the chairman of
the committee of most of his power and
usefulness.
Senator Wellington saya:
My ultimatum is that the committee muft
rescind its action or I will retire from it. I
will n"t turn a hand until they da this. No
headquarters will be opened, and I am jroir.g
to Cumberland to wait until I hear from them.
I think thai the ticket Is beaten beyond any
question. The committee has offended every
Maipterite and absolutely ignored the coloreÂ«l
voters. There is a day of reckoning coming
which they will not like to meet.
The Senator further charges Gover
nor Lowndes with having surrendered
control of the party to John K. Cowen
of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad,
and asserts that United States Senator
McComas is also controlled by the same
influence.
Governor Lowndes and Senator Wel
lington have been fast friends, the lat
ter at one time having filled a position
in the banking house of the Governor
in Cumberland. Md. Their political
fortunes have been closely allied and
much of the credit for the conduct of
the campaign which elected Governor
Lowndes four years ago has heretofore
been accorded to Senator Wellington,
who was at that time chairman of the
Republican State Central Committee.
ANTI-IMPERIALISTS'
STAND AS TO POLITICS
BOSTON. Sept 21.â The Anti-Impe
rialist League to-day issued the follow
ing:
Unauthorized statements having been
made as to the objects of the anti-imperial
conference in Chicago, October 17, it
should be said that there will be no at
tempt there at negotiation with any po
litical party. It is hoped that this con
ference may plan for a systematic effort
to establish anti-imperialist leag-ues and
committees throughout the country, with
the intention of developing and crystal
lizing the opposition to the Presidents
policy.
It ip true that in doing this the anti
imperialists must denounce _vlr. McKinley
individually because he unlawfully initi
ated the slaughter in the Philippines by
his declaration of war. December 21, 189^,
at a time when the United States was
soimenly bound by the protocol to pree-
Berve the status quo.
It simplifies our efforts, that because nf
this impregnable fact neither the country
nor any political party in it is responsible
for Mr. McKinley ? war or is in any way
bound to support it.
The anti-imperialists hope to arouse
their fellow-citizens to the gravity of the
issue which has been forced upon the peo
ple, so that no candidate for the next
Presidency ran expect success unless he
disavows rhe colonial and imperial acts
which have actuated Mr. McKinley and
his pernicious advisers.

tween various railroad interests for a

vising the San Pedro harbor work for

Special Dispatch to The <~*a.
NEW YORK. Sept. 21.-Corporatlon
Counsel Whalen, Justice Charles H.
Truix. President Silas B. Dutcher ami
Engineer Peter A. Nostrand. were the
witnesses put on the stand to-day at the
Mazpt investigation of the affairs of the
Ramapo Water Company. Corporation
Counsel Whalen, who was expected by
Counsel Moss tc appear before the com
mittee two days ago, made a point to
day of his willingness to appear and tats
appearance without a subpoena. The
corporation counsel stood by the Ramano
water contract, explaining that he had
trade some changes in the original copy
of a perfectly legal document by whica
the city's interests were well protected
The witness and Counsel Moss had some
argument on the nature of the questions
put to the witness and the corporation
counsel evaded many of the questions
rei using to reply in definite terms. Re
garding his opposition to the motion fur
a permanent injunction against the
Ramapo contract he merely said:
"1 had to oppose."
Justice Truix said he was a stockholder
in the Ramapo Company and that in a
conversation with Richard Croker about
two years ago he told Mr. Croker it was
a good thing. He stated also that some
of th<? amendments proposed to the origi
nal contract were made by him.
President Dutcher was called for the
purpose 01' ascertaining whether ne had
yet learned the whereabouts of the com
pany's secretary, in whose possession the
books of the company were said to be.
But ne had not so learned. He remained i
in the committee room for a few minutes !
aft.'r Knglneer Nostrand was called as a
â witness.
Mr. Nostrand had in his possession the
options of the Ramapo Company, but he 'â 
refused to surrender them to Mr. Mods j
without orders of the President of the !
Board of Trustees. Mr. Dutcher refused
to give the desired order. In the course
cf the argument that followed between !
Counsel Moss and the witness regarding i
the turning over to the Mazet committee
th* papers, President Dutcher left the \
rcom and Mr. Moss ordered that Prfsi- i
den: Dutcher's action be entered upon !
the record.
Other witnesses examined to-day had to j
do with the building codes commission.

DESIRELLO IS
NOT CONVICTED
Jury Fails to Agree and
Is Discharged by
the Judge.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
REDWOOD CITY, Sept. 21.â The trial
of Fred Desirello for the murder of young
James Johnston came to an end to-day.
The jury retired at 4 o'clock p. m. ar.'i
after having taken ten ballots announced
that they could not agree. They were
then discharged by the Judge. The vote
was nine for conviction ajid three for ac
quittal.
At the opening ot the court this morn
ing the defendant took the stand and
testified as to the shooting. He told a
straightforward story that could not he
shaken on cross-examination. Defendant
told about his visit to San Francisco
with his wife on the morning of the ISth
of March and of his return to the cours
ing park at Colma in the afternoon. After
the races business kept him at the park
until 6:3 i) or after. His wife met him there
and they proceeded together toward the
town. "On going a short distance they
separated, defendant going to the White
House. Here he met a man by the name
â  Â£ Murphy, with whom he had business,
and while talking to him in front cf the
bouse he heard the sounds of galloping
horses and the rattling of a wagon. When
they got opposite the house he ran Into
the mad <n front of the horses and threw
up his hands crying. "Halt, halt!" He
jumped to one side as the horses were al
most upon him and ran after the wagon
crying to the boys to stop. Thinking that
possibly they could not hear him on ac
count pi the great noise made by tne
wagon 'he drew his revolver while running
and fired directly up In the air. To this
the boys paid no attention and it was
then that he tired two shots at the horses,
one of which struck Johnston in the neck.
During all this time he was running as
hard as he could, reaching Bllli's store
about the same time as the wagon did.
He saw Johnston jump from the wag' in
and heard him say "I'm shot." As the
boy was about to fall to the porch of the
store he caught him and did all he could
for him. sending his wife for whisky,
calling for a light and ordering a doctor.
He remembered his wife saying: "My
God. Fred, what have you done?" to
which he replied: "It was an accident:
I thought the horses were running away.
I shot to kill the horses." He subse
quently sent for Constable Nevills and
gave himself up and was brought to Red
woo,] City.
District Attorney Bullock argued the
case for the people and E. F. Fitzpatrick
and H. W. Walker for the defendant.
Judge Buck then instructed the jury and
the case was submitted to them at 4
o'clock this afternoon.
BOUNDARY COMMISSION
TAKES A SHORT REST
Adjourns Until Monday After lis
tening to Argument of Ben
jamin Harrison.
PARIS, S^-pt. 21.â Continuing' his argu
ment in behalf of Venezuela before the
Anglo- Venezuelan Boundary Arbitration
Commission, ex-President Benjamin Har
rison said the issue of diplomatic corre
spondence showed that Great Britain had
never claimed more than the Dutch did.
He held that the legal and political de
partments of the British Foreign Office
did not seem to agree, the latter taking:
its inspiration from the surveyor. Sir
Robert Schombergk, while Sir Richard
Webster, the British Attorney General,
went further and claimed the extended
Schombergk line.
'Continuing. Mr. Harrison said he pro
posed to show that the Dutch rights of
>U were much smaller than those of
any line now suggested by Great Brit
ain, and that those lines were iww ex
tinct through the disputed territory. Any
extension, he asserted, of the original
lines could only be claimed through pre
scription or adverse holding, and that all
of the rest of the country belonged to
Venezuela. The commission adjourned
until Monday.
THOUSANDS OF TROUT DIE

JACKSON. Sept. 21.â Twenty-four thou
' sand young trout from the hatchery in
Northern California arrived in lone a few j
; days ago en route for Kirkwood's sta
tion in Alpine County, intended for the |
stocking of Caple Lake, near Klrkwoods. j
A team was hired to convey the fish from I
I lone to their destination, a distance of
ninety miles.
I The first day's journey brought the
I teamster to Pine Grove, a fourth of the '
total distance, where he remained for the ;
night. The next morning he found the ;
surface of the tanks covered with dead !
fish. Less than 500 of the total number :
remained alive. It was useless to con
tinue the trip, so the live fish were placed
in a pond at Pine Grove. Thus ended
the first attempt to stock the waters of i
! the high Sierras in this direction.

THE DREYFUS FINALE.
PSIDENT LOUBET and his Ministry have
d on the line we indicated as probable
I by the pardon of Dreyfus have ended the
of the incident. To the general
of the civilized world the punishment of. the un
r, twice convicted on testimony that
â¢ icient, was the revolting fea
ture of the tragedy. Caged on Devils Island or h
mured in a Corsica!. i Dreyfus appealed to I
infuriated imagination of many people?, lint pac
i. at liberty, reunited with his family,
he becomes the object of a less pitying personal in
terest, and France moves out of the fop US of furious
g which she occupied during the days that fol
lowed'the verdict at Kennes.
It is true that Dreyfus rests under the imputation
ly t honor, implied in military conviction
. but the world looks upon his pardon as a
vindication, since pardons in cn-c of undoubted trea
â¢ .: â  -t unknown. It is the highest crime
gnized by the state that can be committed againsf
d is lilted out of the rank of offenses committed
by individuals against each other. These the state
'. their punishment is often either com
muted or averted entirely by that means. But treason
i- against the state itself, aimed at its life, which in a
high sense is the life of all who exist under its sov
nty. When treason is proved beyond doubt, the
rarely arrests judgment. Now, in view of this
strict rule, and of the high necessity which enjoins it,
there is a feeling that conviction of the crime should
be upon trial in which the accused is given every op
portunity of defense, and in which the case' of the
state against him must rest upon direct evidence,
proving the overt act which constitutes the offense.
When the trial involves merely the charge against
him; and a vehement expression of the belief of wit
nesses that he is guilty., without proof of an act, and
me state is not required to prove his guilt but de
mands that he prove his innocence, a conviction loses
all moral force.
These features in the trial of Dreyfus fixed the -at
tention of the world, and outside of French army cir
cles there is no feeling that his conviction so pro
cured in any way tarnishes his honor.
A pardon, following conviction and sentence so
closely, greatly strengthens this confidence in his
military integrity and promotes the feeling that he was
selected as a victim, a scapegoat, for the offenses of
others.
His plaintive declaration, that liberty is to him
nothing without honor, strikes a sympathetic chord, I
but its vibrations are affected by the feeling that!
there rests but little stain upon that honor which he
â 
The world must credit France and President
â  t with wisdom in making the best e^it from
an embarrassing situation, and to Dreyfus himself is
to be ascribed a high degree of patriotic discretion
when he declares that it is to his country and his
countrymen that he will' seek vindication that will
leave his name stainless:
The finale is satisfactory: it restores the good
feeling that for a few days was interrupted, and the
just mind will look upon France as a nation willing
to do its utmost to correct its errors and mistakes.
( )nly a small minority of Frenchmen chatter about
prestige being lost by doing right. There is no wide
difference between the rules of conduct required of
an individual and of a nation. There is no community
so sodden and sunk in grossness and brutality as to
withdraw its respect from a man brave enough to
acknowledge his error and correct it. The world
-.the tribute of its respect to a nation brave
enougii to do like wise.
Stockton has the fair crowd this week, and the ex
hibition both as to the show and as to the visitors
promises to be a record-breaker. The success of the
Ftn.te Fair has given a boom to all such expositions,
and all will profit by it.
The French music hall singer who has pursued Tim
Teffries across the ocean will probably give him more
trouble than forty Sharkeys, and what is worse, hi

CONGRESS AND THE TAX-SHIRKERS.
SENATOR PERKINS and members of the
House of Representatives from this State have,
in response to an inquiry from The Call, de
clared themselves clearly and emphatically in favor of
so amending the war revenue law as to remove from
it any ambiguities by language which alford a pre
text for tax-shirking on the part of express compa
nies telegraph companies or other corporations.
The issue has been forced upon Congress by the
success with which such corporations as the \\ ell--
Fargo Company have shifted the burden of taxation
from themselves upon the public. The shirking has
been carried on persistently, notwithstanding the
plain intent of the law is that the companies shall
affix revenue stamps to receipts or bills of lading, and
notwithstanding the courts have repeatedly sustained
that intent.
In his reply to the inquiry of The Call Senator Per
kins said: "I know it was the intention of the Fi
nance Committee of the Senate that had the war
revenue bill before them for consideration,
a? well as the intention of the Senate
when the bill was passed, that the law should
apply to express and telegraph companies as
well as railroad, steamship and other transportation
companies giving receipts and bills of lading. There
fore if there is any ambiguity in the language of the
law which exempts express and telegraph companies
from paying their taxes. I shall consider it my duty
to vote for such an amendment as will remedy the
defect."
In that statement we hare an explicit 1 declaration
of the intent of the Senate in enacting the law and
an expressed doubt as to any ambiguity of the law.
As a matter of face it is not ambiguous. Any man
who reads it can understand the plain meaning that
express and telegraph companies should pay the
stamp taxes, and the coiirts have again and again de
clared that meaning. Still, the law is not enforced.
The express and telegraph companies continue to ex
tort the tax from the public and to set at defiance the
intent of Congress, the indignation of the people and
the decisions of the court?.
What is required in a case of this kind is an act of
Congress imposing -a heavy penalty for tax-shirking
and providing for a speedy means of bringing all dis
puted questions of taxation to a final decision by the
Supreme Court. It is well remembered that when
the great corporatidns of the country wished a
prompt settlement of the disputed validity of the in
come tax they obtained it within a few months. They
obtained it Inf. ire the first installment of the tax was
collected. Now the country demands that when the
people de-ire a tax question settled they shall be able
to obtain the settlement as promptly as did the cor
porations in the income tax cases.
The shirking of the war taxe< by Wells- Fargo Com
pany began by an utter to The Call, and presumably
to other large patrons, that the company would con
nive at a system of cheating the Government It was
proposed that The Call send its packages to the ex
press company by the wagon-load, and the company
would receipt for the whole load as one package, thus
requiring but one stamp. . Beginning in that way by
an effort to promote frauds, the abuses of the cor
poration have been carried to such an extent they
have now become a public scandal, rejecting dis
credit upon the Government itself.
The war revenue law will be revised at the next
session of Congress. That much is certain. It re
main^ to lie seen whether in the revision the shirking
corporations will have the power to still further de
feat the ends of law and justice. The California dele
gation we are now assured will stand firmly for the
people. So far as this State is concerned the issue
against the extortionate companies has been w<ui.
and there is every reason to believe an overwhelming
majority <>; both houses will stand with us in the fight
that is to come.
"Fighting Bob" Evans will direct the policing of
the course over which the great international yacht
race will be sailed. If he needed. any assistance San
Francisco would gladly "find him the loan" of the
only Michael Joseph Conboy, with the certainty that
there would be two good policemen on duty at the
worst.
The love of aged John Nicholl of Oakland for Miss
Hodge of that same city appears, from all the testi
mony, to have died of heart failuVe. The breach of
promi-e suit Hint followed may be said to have car
ried unpleasantness in its wake.
SALISBURY'S RESPONSIBILITY.
WHILE Lord Salisbury, said the British dis
patches of yesterday, "is quietly at home at
â Hatfield Huu^e. Mr. Chamberlain is buried in
work at the Colonial Office, and ftouble forces at the
Royal Arsenal and the dockyards are straining every
nerve to equip and transport troops to the Cape."
In that .statement we have another evidence of the
extent to which the aged Premier of Great Britain
has surrendered the direction of the empire in the
crisis that confronts it to the aggressive and domi
neering Secretary of State for the Colonies. The
situation is not a good one for the empire, for, de
spite his defects and his age, Salisbury is a wi-er
an than Chamberlain, and could he rouse and
exert himself would be much better fitted to con
duct the controversy with the Boers to a peaceable
conclusion.
Some of the more eminent Englishmen in depart
ments of effort having no connection with politics
are aware of the danger which is threatened by Salis
bury's seeming retirement from control and have by
public appeals endeavored to rouse him to action.
In a notable letter Frederic Harrison warns him that
he will be held responsible for whatever consequences
follow. ".You are," he said, "the chief of the Govern
ment and the accepted head of the most powerful
party known to recent times. No other living states
man can pretend to such experience in international
affairs, nor does any other possess in so eminent a
the confidence of the nation. It seems an un
natural thing that our country should be on the verge
of a formidable war while you are more or less in the
background * * * It is not the business of the
Colonial Office Jo embark this empire in a foreign
war. It is no duty of the .Minister for the Colonies
to make war, nor to render war inevitable."
Having emphasized the responsibility of the Pre
mier in the crisis. Mr. Harrison goes on to point out
that Great Britain has no further claims upon the
Transvaal than those which have been conceded, and
that the recent demands of Chamberlain have been
sc aggressive as to virtually amount to war. In the
course of his appeal he says:
''Measured by the compromises with foreign na
tions which you may justly claim to have brought to
a successful issue, the* concessions already accepted
bj the republic are indeed decisive. From nine years
to seven years, from seven to five years, from one
demand of the UitJanders to another,, the Boers have
given way. They have already, conceded the whole
of the original demand made upon them, and have
even added mori And at every fresh occasion Sir
Alfred Milner is instructed to make further demands,
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 22, 1899.
i until throughout the Transvaal, and we may well add
at home, the impression prevails that it is not conces
â  sion of claims which is sought from the republic, but
i submission, humiliation, and loss of independence. Is
! this how negotiations have been carried on when you,
I my Lord, as head of the Foreign Office, have dealt
I with Russia, Turkey, France or the United States?
; This is not negotiation. It is war â war of naked
;'gÂ»ressior. â war wherein the Boers will not yield
, without a desperate struggle and after bloody com
bats â a war which cannot be closed by a few vic
i tories nor the traces of it wiped out by a few prom-
I ises or proclamations â a war wherein many true and
! patriotic Englishmen devoutly trust that the Boers
| may not be ultimately crushed."
Salisbury is old and well nigh exhausted, but he
c;ui hardly be indifferent to such appeals if he be not
wholly incapacitated for his high office. He has been
all his life an advocate of peace, and his proudest
'<â  boasts have been in the diplomatic skill with which
he has avoided war. He may yet exert himself to
stay the aggressions of the ambitious Chamberlain,
and it is in that hope the conservative element and
juster portion of the British public are now watching
to hear of his return to London and active resump
tion of the duties of his office.
It is asserted that in his appeal to Victoria for a
1 peaceable settlement of the controversy between her
â  Government and his own President Kruger ad
: dressed her Majesty as "Dear Queen," and if the
i story be true it is but another proof that the stern.
I resolute old Boer cares little for the formalities of
i etiquette in diplomacy, and is mainly concerned
; about saying the right thing and having it understood
; by the right person.
i â 
SOME time ago a paper read before a Farmers'
Institute at Princeton contained the statement
that the number of chickens marketed in the
United States last year amounted to 3,350.000,000, and
lof eggs 13,000,000,000. The total value of chickens
and eggs produced was $290,000,000.
By way of showing the comparative importance of
the poultry industry it was further stated that the
value of our tobacco crop has rarely been as much as
$43,000,000. The value of our potato crop is less than
<50.000.000 on the average. The value of our barley
crop is not often as much as $30,000,000. An oat crop
worth $200,000,000 is unusual. Our annual output of
pigiron has rarely exceeded $130,000,000 in value.
Coal, by far the most valuable of our mineral prod
ucts, gives a total annual output of some $200,000,000.
While the authority for the high estimate of the
value of the poultry product was not given, the publi
cation of the figures directed a good deal of attention
to the subject. A careful study of the poultry business
in .Missouri by a writer for the St. Louis Globe-
Democrat shows such a production in that State as
to justify the large valuation put upon, the output of
the whole country. It is stated the poultry shipped
and sold in Missouri last year amounted to over
70,000,000 pounds. It realized the producers at first
price $4,000,000. The eggs shipped were 3.3.935.0Â°Â°
dozens, and they brought to the people who gathered
thorn from the nests $3,393,000. Poultry and eggs to
gether yielded to the farmers of Missouri, after their
own tables had been supplied, $8,298,000.
The writer notes that the two great items of live
tock production in Missouri last year, cattle and hogs,
yielded", respectively. $34,000,000 and $36,000,000 each,
only about four times what the poultry did. And
they consumed the corn crop of 190,000,000 bushels.
and kept a considerable proportion of the farmers of
the State doing chores from daylight to dark all
winter.
A curious fact is disclosed in the statement that in
the egg trade a broken egg is not lost to the market.
When in the course of the packing at the large houses
an egg is broken it is frozen and offered for sale in
that way. The writer says: "Frozen eggs in great
masses are not bad to look upon. They are not al
lowed to thaw until the time comes for use. Tiny
are shipped in refrigerated cars, and such consign
ments as go to Alaska for the gold regions are put
into cold storage on board of the steamships. The
Klondike demand does not begin to take all of the
frozen eggs. Missouri alone furnishes millions of
cracked eggs in the course of a year. Nine eggs will
average a pound. The frozen egg product is sold by
weight. With the large bakers and cracker makers
in the cities the frozen eggs are in demand. Some
restaurants also buy the big tin buckets of the frozen
article. Certain classes of restaurants serve scrambled
eggs and omelets in winter made from the frozen
. and patrons are none the wiser."
Poultry production is one of the few rural indus
tries of which California cannot boast a superiority
j over her sister States. So far from having egg-; to
! sell we are importers of eggs and not infrequently of
poultry. The amount of profit revealed by the statis
tics quoted shows it would be worth our while to give
more attention to the hen. She is something of a
bonanza, and doesn't cackle any more than she has a
right to.
Some notable instances lately have shown that
water is one of the most important factors in modern
warfare. The Boers are only waiting until it descends
I in the form of rain on the veldt until they begin hos
; tile operations against Great Britain; General Otis will
â¢ not move against the Filipinos until it quits raining;
and the firemen of Paris have just shown what a pow
erful agent it was in reducing Fort Chabrol. Guerin
no sooner saw the hose turned in his direction than
he quit.
The latest speculator on the future of England pre
dicts that after the Paris exposition is over France
and Germany will unite in an alliance for promoting
: expansion, the Germans to annex Holland and her
j colonies while the French will annex Belgium and
the Congo country in Africa. Great Britain and
Russia are expected to remain passive while the
spoliation is going on for fear of one another.
The first jury summoned to assist the provisional
court in Porto Rico has won the thanks of the Judge
by convicting the defendant in the case, and it is now
â¢ probable a good many of the honest natives will be
lieve that juries arc called just for the purpose of con
victing, and will deem it a matter of etiquette to return
a verdict of guilty every time.
The Klondike gold yield for the year is now esti
mated at about $8,000,000, which is fully a third less
than that of last year. The big developments that
were expected have not been realized and it looks
as if the country would have to diversify its indus
tries or lose nearly all of its present population.
The assertion of Dreyfus that he will demand a re
hearing of his case is but natural under the circum
stances, but it is to be hoped he will have a second
thought and think differently. The world has had as
much of the case as it cares for.
Since the sentiment of humanity has done so much
for Dreyfus it ought to be able to accomplish some
thing to stay the hand of Britain against the Boers,
and incidentally, too, for the Filipinos:
THE HEN AS A EONANZA.
FAMOUS " BLIND ADDRESS " READER
OF THE POSTOFFICE IS DEAD
WW, STONK, known throughout the United States as the "blind ad
dress" reader of the city Postofflce, died at his home, 502 Jefferson
avenue, Brooklyn, yesterday from heart failure. His success in sup
_ plying deficiencies in addresses was wonderful. His memory was re
' markable. Given the name of a small country postofflce in the United
States, he could name the State in which it was located or how many of a similar
name there were in the United States.
During his long service in the city Postoffice he became an expert in decipher
ing handwriting- which to others would have been illegible. Owing to this pro
ficiency he was promoted to be chief clerk in the office of "directory searches."
He v/as originally appointed to a clerkship in the Postoffice on June 13, ]>."5, and
servt-d continuously up to the time of his death.
Mr. Stone first began the study of deciphering bad addresses while a general
clerk. He carefully compiled a manuscript book of the names of all the streets
in the United States. He was several years in completing this volume. The
number? of the houses on the streets were indicated. The book was recognized
by the General Postoffice Department in ISBO and copies sent to all Postmasters.
This is an instance of how hi.s system worked: A letter was received from
Roumania addressed "Miss Maria Bellew, 10 Alphonso street, America.*' By re
ferring to his handbook Mr. Stone found that in the United States there were
two Alphonso struts, one in Oharlottesville, Va., the other in Providence, R. I.
He found, however, that the streets in Charlottesville, Va.. were not numbered,
but there was a No. 10 in Providence. The letter was sent there and it proved to
be the right address.
Some of the addresses submitted to him were worse than the Navy Depart
ment's cipher code. It is asserted by .iis fellow employes that out of 100 letters
supposed to bear illegible addresses, Mr. Stone could correctly readdress 95.
There is only one other clerk In the office who can carry on the work, O. G.
Manger, who will doubtless succeed Jiir. Stone as chief clerk. He has been In
the department for fifteen years and has been a close student of Mr. Stone's sys
tem. Mr. Stone was 66 years of age.

STATEMENT OF GENERAL
MANAGER KRUTTSCHNITT
DENIAL THAT THE SOUTH r/RN
PACIFIC SYSTEM IS GUILTY
OF CBJQETKTAL PARSI
MONY.
Citation of Experience of Other Sys
tems of American Hallways â De
cline of Accidents on the Southern
Pacific System, for the Past Eight
een Months.
The general manager of the Southern
Pacific system of railroads addresses
the public In the following star- i
of facts relating to th* mai -
Southern Pacific Company's
Recent articles in the daily papers
about accidents on the Southern Pa
cific lines are so unjust to Us c-rfloers
and employes and so inaccurate as to
: t some official statement seems
due the public in order that an impar
tial - â  may be formed.
Charges under the following head
ings have been ma.-
1. The system of train opera
defective and the r- - . ties placed
; yes by t: - era Pacific
greater than those placed
-
The Southern Pacific Company is run
ning- its trains under the American
Railway Association standard code of
train ruies in us? en all thÂ« important ;
systems in the United States. They j
embody the experience of tiie best tal
ent in railroad operating departments:
A management would be justly subject
to severe criticism for not using them.
The duties and responsibilities of train
men on Southern Pacific lines are no
greater and no less than those of the
trainmen of the Pennsylvania. New
York Central or Baltimore and Ohio.
2. Employes are discharged only when
accidents happen; no notice is taken
â¢when accidents do not occur, justifying
the Inference that discipline is lax.
It is true that employes are not dis
charged for every offense they commit.
There is no precedent in any code of
laws for inflicting- capital punishment
for all offenses. Discipline is rigidly
enforced according to a system that is
now in operation on most of the best
managed systems in America. Author
ities agree* that perfect discipline con
sists In noticing all shortcomings and
Inflicting adequate punishment, seeking
the general improvement of the men
and not their dismissal, which is re-
Eorted to in extreme cases only. It is
believed that the company has as faith
ful careful and efficient en as any
Eystem in the United States, and it is
unjust to brand them as Inefficient and
careless because a very small percent
age have recently, through their negli
gence, caused losses of life and prop
erty.
3. On great Eastern lines negligence
has bsen very nearly eliminated, and
one rarely hears of smashups on the
New York Central and Pennsylvania
Central lines, although each carries
twenty trains where the Southern Pa
cific carries one. etc.
The Southern Pacific does not fear
comparison with any other large sys
tem in the United States. The above
named great Eastern lines have not
eliminated accidents, although they
have double and even quadruple main
line tracks and block signals. The lists
of serious accidents reported monthly
In the technical papers show that, for
the last eight months and a half for
â¢which reports are available, the Penn
sylvania had thirty-three and th- New-
York Central twenty-one serious acci
dents. The Journal reporting these
wrecks details the serious ones only,
which amount to about one-fourth of
tt* total. As every accident, no mat
ter how trivial, that occurs on the
Southern Pacific line Is magnified out
of til proportion, the above figures
shou d be multiplied by about four for
comparative purposes. These lines do
not r..n twenty trains to the Southern
Pacific's one. The annual train mileage
of the Southern Pacific is exactly the
same at that of the New York Central,
and on!;- 39 per cent less than that of
the Pennsylvania, instead of one-twen
tieth as much as stated. It will occur
to a fair-ninded person that it 16 nat
ural they should not hear of smashups
In th- Sta-.es of New York and Penn
sylvania, s-ime three thousand miles
distant, an. it is also quite probable
that the Pennsylvania and New York
dailies do net give the prominence to
Southern Padflc accidents that is given
them by the tan Francisco press.
4 "ThÂ«; indi-tment of the Southern
Pacific rests oi a criminal parsimony:
the road alway< runs short-handed."
It is net true that the Southern Pa
cific runs short-ianded; to confirm this
it is â¢ â¢â â  mate th..t the Interstate Com
merce Commissions "Statistics of Rail
ways" are within reach of the public,
and those interest*.-} can verify the cor
rectness of this statement. The "Sta
tistics of Railways- for 1?99 shows, for
alllines west of th. Mississippi River,
as follows:

5. It is specifically stated <->f the wreck
[at Newman that it "was caused from
the fact that the engineer of the teach
â  ers' special was asieep at his post, ab
solutely unable to held up bia head by
reason of the fact that he was over
worked. â¢ * " There is only one
: theory that will account for nearly a
[ acore cf accidents that have occurred
along the line of the Southern Pacific
during the present year. * â¢ â¢ It is
that the policy of retrenchment In
augurated by the Southern Pacific
Company at the beginning of the year
is responsible for all the accidents in
that it compels engineers, firemen and
trainmen to work when they are nearly
dropping on their feet for want of
sleep, while it has cut down the force
of track-walkers to the danger point."
It is not true that a policy of re
trenchment -was Inaugurated at the be
r.g of the year; indeed, it is but
a short while since the management
â  -itieized in the press be
taust the expenses of the fiscal year
which closed on June 30 fwhlch em
braces the flrst six months of this
calendar year during- which the alleged
policy of retrenchment was inaugu
rated) were very gher than
md 11 - -ted this had caused
great dissatisfaction among the stock
.<=. Trainmen are r.<n paid by a
c day which can be stretched out
..1 to effect economies, but are paid
â¢ .- basis of miles or hours run. and.
putting aside ail feelings of humanity
or consideration foi its employes on the
part of the management, there is no
tive f â er -.rising the
the company cannot save one
r thereby. The accident at New
man was caused by an employe who
had been on duty only four hours after
having been off duty at a terminal sta
twelve h"'irs and thirty minutes.
His own statement as to acknowledg
ing signals, which is corroborated by
the testimony of nine other men. proves
conclusively that he was certainly not
â¢~p.
As no serious accident has beÂ«>n
caused by defect? it is not
: what is meant by the statement
that track-walkers force has been cut
to the danger point. Ther* is not
a foot of track orer which trains are
operated on the err ' the
company's system that* is not daily
properly and carefu "cd.
6. The statement is mad" a? to the
Farr, k that the engineer
up his life at his post "f duty
was drunk, that the equipment dam
aged in the wreck was poor and the
.- - car sills had been splic^i.
- â¢ to warrant
the charsr-' of drunkenness -igainst the
deaii - â¢ found. The no
bility and self- I of (he iast act
of his life should ted him
from such a charge unless well f i
cd. Th c at the si] -
the coach was unfounded also, as not
a sill in the car was broken. It was
-â - for any one to sÂ»e th^m, as
th^y were covered and none of the
covering was torn off in the accident.
It is a fact often noticed that acci
t dents seem to occur in cycles. A num
ber will occur close together and com
i paratively long periods of immunity
' will thereafter be enjoyed. Systems of
! discipline or methods of management
. cannot fairly be Judged by a small
; number of cases. Judgment should be
: predicated on statistics covering a rea
; sonably long period of time. Although
' it is customary to refer in a very flip
i pant way to the little concern given by
railroad managers to accidents. It
i should be remembered that they are re
! sponsible to the owners of the proper
i ties, and motives of self-interest, if no
! higher ones, force them' to take cog
: nizance of each and every accident that
i happens. The Interstate Commerce
i Commission requires reports of all ac
j cidents occurring on the roads of the
, United States, and we have a basis for
â  comparing the safety of operation and,
! Incidentally, the efficiency of discipline,
j on the Southern Pacific lines with a"ll
! lines of the United States. The reports
â  of the Interstate Commerce Commis
| sion furnish data which show that a
; passenger would have to travel about
j 181,000.000 miles over the roads of the
1 United States generally before being
: killed in a train accident, and that he
i would have to travel 10,420.000 miles be
; fore being injured in a train accident.
â¢ Similar data covering the operations of
; all the Southern Pacific lines show that
! during- the eighteen months ending
'â¢â  June 30, 1599, although 32,322,000 pas
| sengers were carried an average dis-
I tance of thirty-one miles each â equiva
! lent to. the Journey of a single pas
! senger of 1,000,000,000 miles â not one
! was killed in a train accident, and. be
j fore being injured In an accident, a
1 passenger would have to travel the
! average distance given below:
During six months ending June 30,
18SS, 16,290.000 miles.
During six months ending December
31. IS9S, 20,230,000 miles.
During six months ending June 30.
1839. 65.283.000 miles.
From the above the public can Judge
whether a system of discipline and
methods of management that have
shown a steady -Increase In the safety
of travel for three periods of six months
each is Inherently bad, as it has been
recently represented to be.

SAVERS' CONFERENCE
CONCLUDES ITS WORK
Resolutions Adopted Recommend
ing Legislation in Various States
fop-Proper Control and Reg
. ulation of Corporations.
ST. LOUIS, Sept. 21.â After two days
of speech-making the Governors. At
torneys General and other statesmen
who have been holding a conference
here by Invitation of Governor Savers
of Texas adopted a resolution outlining
the legislation needed to control the so
called trusts and combines and ad
journed Bine die. The resolutions em
bodied were agreed to after a long ses
sion of the committee. So widely di
vergent were the views presented for
Its consideration that It was after mid
night when the committee was able to
arrive at any conclusion. The whole
matter was then referred to a sub-com
mittee, composed of Governor McMlllin
of Tennessee and Attorneys General
fmith of Texas and Campbell of Colo
rado, to put into proper shape. The
conference was to have met at 9 o'clock,
but it was noon before It got down to
business, as the committee on resolu
tions was not ready to report until
then.
Governor McMillln. chairman of the
committee on resolutions, presented the
report of the committee as follows:
The committee on resolutions, to which
were referred several resolutions and
papers. In lieu of all of them submits the
following, with the recommendation that
tt be accepted by this conference:
That we believe the best present avail
able remedies lie along the following lines:
1. The enactment and enforcement by
the several States and the nation of legis
lation that shali adequately and fully
define as crimes any attempted monopo
lization or restraint of trade in any line of
, Industrial activity, with provisions for
adequate punishment, both of the indi
vidual or the corporation that shall be
found guilty thereof, punishment to the
corporation to the extent of dissolution.
2. The enactment by each of the States
of the Union of legislation for the ade
quate and proper control and regulation
of corporations chartered by that State,
and we recommend as efficacious a system
of reports to and examination by State
authority of the corporations organized
under Its laws, to the end that they be
brought to a fair observance of the laws
which they are created.
3. The enactment by each State of laws
that will prevent the entrance of any for
eign-created corporation into its limits for
any other purpose than Interstate com
merce except on terms that will put the
forelgf -created corporation on a basis of
equality with the domestic-created cor
poration of the State entered, and subject
to the same laws, rules and regulations of
the State that It enters, which are applic
able to the domestic corporations of that
Stat* and to this end we reccmmend
legislation that would make it mandatory
upon corporations seeking to engage in
business outside of the State of their crea
tion that they procure license* from the
foreign State as a condition precedent to
their entry Into such State: such license
to be granted on such terms and subject
to such restrictions as will place the cor
poration subject to the same control. In
spection, supervision and regulation as the
domestic corporation of that State, and

thereof are violated.
! 1. The enactment of State legislation
! declaring that a corporation created in
j one State to do business exclusively In
j other States than where created shall be
I prohibited from admission into any State.
j This proposition ts supported by decisions
: of the Supreme Courts of several States,
but we believe it should become legisla

States.
! o. That no corporation should be formed j

tlon.
6. That no corporation shall own or hold '
any stock in another corporation engaged '
in a similar or competitive business, and j
that no officer or director of a corpora- j
tlon shall be the officer or director or the ;
owner of stock in another corporation j
engaged in a similar competitive busi

be withheld when desired, we recommend j
as the sense of the conference that each S
State pass laws providing that no cor- {
poration which is a member of any pool j
or trust in that State or elsewhere can I
do business in that State.
Resolved. That it is the sense of this ;
conference that all the capital stock of !
private corporations should be fully paid,
either, first, in lawful money; or, second.
In property of the actual cash value of j
| the amount of capital stock; and that
i in all private corporations, with a capital
' stock Issued in excess of the amount aet
j ually paid up as above, provided, the
i shareholders shall be liable to the extent
! of twice the face value of the stock held
j by each.
Resolutions thanking: Governor Say-
I ers for his efforts in behalf of the con
i ference were adopted. Before declar
' ins the conference adjourned Governor
Sayers spoke briefly, saying in part:
Of course. It goes without saying that
i I feel very grateful to you not only for
! the manifestation of your recognition of
i the proper discharge of my duties as your
i presiding officer, but I want to express
; my sincere and earnest gratitude and ac
kr!i -Tv-lodgment, that upon the simple sug
gestion which I felt it my duty to make
to the Governors and Attorneys General
: of this Union, that twelve States re
i sponded. This has never before occurred
j in the history of our Government where
i-such questions as these were involved.
: I feel it to be my duty to say the idea
â¢ of inviting the Governors and Attorneys
General was not original to myself, but
< one for which I feel responsible to the
j people of this country. Some criticism
has been made upon my action, not here.
but elsewhere, but I think you will bear
me witness that nothing has been done
i to influence your action here. I have had
i requests to communicate In a private way
' with certain persons, but I have said
nothing nor have I written anything upon
trusts, except an article In an August
magazine upon the laws of the Texas
slsture. Nothing has been done in
the darkness or in a corner, but every
thing with the light thrown upon it by
the newspapers of the land.

TRIPLE TRAGEDY
IN WALLA WALLA
O. B. Byland Annihilates
His Family.
JEALOUS OF HIS WIFE
WOUNDED WOMAN BATTLES UN
TIL EXHAUSTED.
After the Killing of His Wife and
Brother He Deliberately Blow*
Out His Own
Brains.
Special Dispatch to The CaJL
WALLA WALLA. Wash.. Sept. ZLâ O.
B. Byland killed hia wife and his brother
I Grant and then committed suicide this
! afternoon. The tragedy occurred under
i the brow of the hill a few hundred yards
> from the State penitentiary. O. B. By
i land arrived here yesterday from Pome
| roy in search of his wife, who, at the
! instance of her mother. Mrs. Kilgore. de
' serted him. She came here several weeks
! ago, since which time she has been llv-
I ing with her mother and Grant Byland-, a
brother of O. B. Bylar.d.
The latter, through a fit of jealousy of
his wife and hatred for his mother-in
'â  law, determined to kill them all. He prg
cured a pistol and quietly stole to the
: house where his wife and brother were,
i Upon being refused entrance, he shot his
brother through the heart, and ha
dropped dead Just outside of the house.
Not finding Mrs. Kllgore. he turned on
his wife, whom he phased into a vacant
lot back of the house, and when a short
I distance behind her shot her in the back.
Although bleeding and weakened from
! the wound, she arose from the ground,
1 and a terrible struggle ensued between
; himself and wife. For several minutes
: they fought desperately, he shooting and
i striking, while she attempted to wrench
' the pistol from him. After becoming ex
hausted she again fell and the Infuriated
i husband ahot her in the face, mutilating
it beyond recognition.
He then lay down "beside his wife and
: shot himself, blowing the top of his head
off.
The bodies lay within a radius of
twenty feet from each other and pre
sented a terrible sight.
Byland and his wife lived at Pomeroy,
and from what can be learned they were
; favorably known in that locality.
A Coroner's Inquest will be held to
morrow morning. A long letter was found
' ; on Byland's body addressed to Coroner
' I Black. In part it says:
: "I got to kiss my wife for the last time,
: and now I am going to kill Grant By
i land and Mrs. Kilgore, and then I am
going to kill my wife, then kill myself
and put an end to us all. Frank Gustof
son of Pomeroy owes me about $40. Get
that to bury m.c and my darling wife.
So I will close. May the Lord God have
mercy on me."

ONE OF THE ATTRACTIVE FEATURES FOR THE
ODD FELLOWS' CELEBRATION NEXT MONTH
TEACHERS DENY
THAT THE LAW
REMOVES THEM
They Read the Code
to Bergerot.
Several of the most prominent and
popular educators in San Francisco's
school department were out yesterday
with a scalping knife and a brace of law
books apiece looking for President Berge
rot of the Board of Education, and his
authority for his statement that they
were holding their positions as teachers
in the high schools by false pretenses.
In announcing yesterday that the Board
of Education waa contemplating a re
grading of all the teachers in the de
partment, Mr. Bergerot took occasion to
say: "It has been discovered that there
are at least six teachers in the high
schools who hold only grammar grade
certificates. These credentials were
issued before life diplomas of the high
school grade were adopted and by some
are construed to < r.tit'e the holder to
teach in the BChools. There are also
many teachers in the grammar schools
who depend upon life diplomas on pri
mary certificates. The men- of the depart
ment demand that teachers have proper
diplomas, and a.s a consequence it Is
probable that we will huve to transfer
at least t^n teachers to positions to which
their credentials entitle them."
In other words Mr. Bergerot is of the
opinion that* life certificated granted
teachers under the old constitution! be
fore high school life diplomas were In
vogue, do not entitle their holders to life
certificates in the high schools of the
present day. In this belief Mr. Bergerot
is a pioneer. Ip to the present tlnv no
authority has agreed with him, or at
least has not had the hardihood to say
so. Even the several sections of the code
which regulate the matter do not bear
him out.
In the list of those whom he accuses
Of holding ["â - ' â  Which they are
nol entitled are such Veterans in the de
partment as Mrs. Prag, Miss X. M.
Thompson, Miss Nellie Owens, Miss Caro
line Hunt, Miss Kate Elliot and other
of those women whose position;- In San
Francisco's schools were established be
fore Mr. Bergerot wns eligible as a po
litical possibility. It was Mrs. Prag who
led the little indignation meeting yester
day in the offices of Secretary Simpson
at the City Hall. None of the ladies who
wÂ«Te jnts.iit was unable to understand
the evident animus of the president cif the
board, and they said 80, and finally
called him up by phone to ask him If he
vouched for the interview as quoted.
He replied that the proposition wjj.s ab
surd and that the positions of the
leachtis assembled could not be
questioned.
"I cannot understand it at all," said
Mrs. Prag. "Uur right to teach in the
high schools upon life certificates granted
under the old constitution has never
been questioned. The School Superin
tendents office ruled upon that question
In 1897 'that life diplomas Issued under
the old constitution are. in effect, hlgh-
Echool life diplomas, and the right of
teachers to teach In- high schools upon
them has never before been questioned.'
"Section 1754 of the Political Code says
practically the same thing, and section
1760 makes the further provision that
holders of diplomas from the State Nor
LADIES OF REBEKAH DRILL CORPS NO. 2.
mal School of that date are also eiiginie.
I, for one. have a Normal certificate, as
kt ll as my life certificate, and there are
others of us who have the same thing."
City and County Attorney Lane is pre
paring an opinion on the question which
he will submit at next Wedn< Bday's mpf-t
--ing of the board. What action is to re
sult will not develop until then.
The Finance Committee heiii a meeting
early yesterday afternoon to give some
further discussion to the question Of re
trenchment, and it was decided to scale
the employes in the repair and other de
partments down to the statutory posi
tions. Nine will be dropped from the re
pair department at once, and ten more
are to be cut off the payroll of the stores
department. It Is figured that by this re
duction a saving of $2000 monthly wi4l be
effected.
July and August claims to the amount
of $33,100 were brought before the com
mittee for passage, but Director Head
blocked matters by insisting that ' the
claims were contracted without author
ization by the board and should not be
paid. Further action along that line was
consequently dropped.
OTIS FAILS TO
BUY THEIR GUNS
Â»
Filipinos Refuse to Give
Up Arms for Cash
Consideration.
â¢
= r'f-lal Pisnnti-h to The Call
CALL HEADQUARTERS, WEL- ;
LINGTON HOTEL, WASHINGTON,
Sept. 21.â Word reaches tho War De
partment that General Otis has sought
to imitate the policy employed in Cuba
âthat of buying Filipino armsâ and
that his efforts have bfen unsuccessful. |
The native uorf given to understand
that upon the surrender of a. gun the
military authorities would pay the per
ton surrendering it $40 and guarantee
his immunity from arrest for previous !
armed opposition to the United States
and protection for the future.
Notwithstanding this offer not one !
bona fide surrender of a gun is re
ported. One native, it is said, appeared j
with a gnn in his hand and the military |
officers began congratulating them- |
selves that the end was in sight and
that when the rest of Aguinaldo's
troops learned of the good treatment
given this man they would follow his
example. A requisition was made on
the treasury for |40, but before the
money was received inventigation un- '
covered the fact that the native was '
acting as an agent for an American i
Boldier, who had captured the gun in I
action and wanted to dispose of it at
Government figures) to the military au- i
thoritles.
In view of the disinclination of the
natives to sell their guns it is evident
that the revolution is not so much con- !
fined to upper ranks as has been be- !
lieved. Were the soldiers not in gym
pathy with th'Mr superior officers it is i
said by army officers that they would !
certainly have surrendered at least in i
small numbers, as they have ample op- j
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 22, 1599.
A VOCALIST
OF ABILITY
The musical and social cult of San
Francisco was well represented at the
concert of Miss Clara Knlisher which
took place at Sherman-Clay Hall last
evening. It is not so often that a VOCal
student returns to us after having stud
ied with a French teacher, and It was
quite Interesting to note the various
phases of the art ss emphasized by the
French method. We find above all a
faultless diction. Miss Kalisher pro
nouflces every â¢ syllabi distinctly and
clearly. No matter in what language she
may sing her enunciation is always char
acteristic of a clear-cut pronunciation.
This is one great advantage to a vocalist. !
Another very important point that we
discover in the young lady's; recital is
exquisite phrasing. She understands re- j
markably well how to enhance the ro
mantic or dramatic character of her se
lections, and is careful to interpret as
much as possible the sentiment which the
composer and author intend to convey.
This is another sign of the refined artist.
Diction and technique may be taught,
but a natural taste for correct interpreta
tion must be inborn.
I would select as the gem of the even
ing the aria from "The Prophet." It in
was embodied the quintessence of dainty
coloring and a touch of colorature that
bespoke the artistic intelligence of the
Vocalist. While in the beginning Miss
Kalisher showed some si^ns of nervous
ness, such as little irregularities in the
lower register resembling a break, and
some heavy breathing here and there,
these results of stage-bright soon disap
peared, and when she arrived at the third
number the young lady had fully recov
ered. I then noticed a true contralto,
resonant and firm in the lower regist"r,
ringing and penetrating in the higher
passages. It is one of those firm voices
which are especially adapted for roman
tic music and which are so useful in
operatic work. Evidently Miss Kalisher
possesses a large circle of admirers, for
the floral tributes she received were as
magnificent as they were numerous.
Frank Coffin, whose snlendld lyric tenor
is so well known and liked on this coast
rendered a few selections by Sullivan and I
Gounod. He sings always with taste, and
as he Is about to leave for Europe, where
his voice will no doubt gain some more
body, it is safe to predict a prosperous
future for him. His farewell concert will j
surely be largely attended.

Injured by a Trolley. Car. I
Patrick J. Heeney. a dealer in hides
residing at 1414 Alabama Ptroet, while on
his way to his home last night with his
wagon, came in collision with car 1018 of
the Folsom-street line, at the Junction of
Twenty-sixth and Alabama streets. The
oar wiis on its way out the San Bruno
road at the time, and as it was dark
Hee&ey did not see the approaching
danger until it was too late t<> get out of
the way. The result was that the car
struck the wagon and threw Heeney out
injuring him severely. The injured man
was removed to the City and County Hos
pital, wheru it was found that he was
Buffering from a contusion of the head
and an abrasure on the nose and side of
the head.
He remained in an unconscious con
dition during the evening and showed
symptoms of being severely injured at
the base of the brain, hemorrhages
through the ears being present. The
wagon was completely wrecked.
BRAUNHART IS
NOW WAITING TO
KNOW HIS PATE
Judge Graham Will
Decide It Monday.
Â«
The case of Buggy Robe Braunhart,
charged with perjury, was left in the
hands of Judge Graham for decision yes
terday morning at the conclusion of two
solid hours of keen argument. Judge
Graham will announce his decision next
Monday morning.
Braunhart occupied a seat In front of
the prisoner's dock beside his attorney.
Garret McEnerney. He was nervous and
excited and the dire dread of the pos
sibility of being held to anower before a
higher court for the commission of his
alleged offense against the sacrednesa" of
the judicial oath stamped his features
with unmistakable signs of grave fear.
While Attorney McEnerney was making
an earnest plea In Braunhart's behalf
Sammy cracked several egotistical smiles.
When reference was made to his Sena
torial career by his own counsel Sammy's
chest swelled out so far that it would
have been no trick at all to break basalt
blocks on it. Sammy's airy bearing under
went a sad change when Attorney Frank
McGowan commenced to get into action.
Sammy made heroic efforts to bear up
under the trying ordeal, but when Sen
ator McGowan began to apply the. lash
unmercifully the Knight of the Buggy
Robe winced visibly and turned to his
counsel for consultation. Senator Mc-
Gowan pictured Braunhart as a scandal
monger who rolled everybody's reputation
under his glib tongue, a veritable wind
bag who would rather tear somebody's
character to pieces than do anything
else in the world. Senator McGowan por
trayed Sammy in â  the role of a trouble
maker shambling along the streets from
one listener to anpther, breathing
slanders 'against- Senator Dunn's reputa
tion and then electing himself to go on
the witness stand In a libel suit and b.ear
alleged false testimony against Senator
Dunn's character, dragging into the case
the names of Senator Bart Burke and J.
F. McGovern, both of whom denied that
they ever said that Senator Dunn's repu
tation was bad or that they had ever dis
cussed Senator Dunn's reputation with
Braunhart. '
In arguing the case Senator McGowan
paid the defendant the . courtesy :of re
ferring to him as "my friend here."
"Not my friend," said Braunhart, as
imperiously as if he was Com Paul In
stead of a defendant being tried for one
of the most revolting offenses on all the
black catalogue of crime.
"Thanks," retorted McGowan In a sat
isfied fashion: "I would feel humiliated
if I had to accept your friendship." .
Sammy's features took on a crestfallen
aspect and for the remainder. of the ar
gument he did not even lean over to
whisper to Attorney McEnerney. Sena
tor McGowan made a very able argu
ment, laying great stress on the fact that
Braunhart's counsel made \ herculean; ef
forts, to cloud the real issues In the case
by heaping uncalled for vituperation on
the head of Senator Dunn.
During his argument for the defense
Attorney McEnerney took advantage of
several technicalities In the law, by which
he hoped to clear Braunhart. I At the con
clusion of - his - argument - Attorney Me-
Enerney made a rather earnest plea to
dismiss the ease against Braunhart out |
of hand, but Judge Graham evidently had i
become convinced that the clime with I
which Braunhart was charged was of too
j serious an import to consider so lightly,
j Judge Graham announced that he would
decide Braunhart's fate next Monday
morning.
When Judge Grahnm took up the
BraUnhari matter yesterday morning At
| torney McEnerney asked to be allowed
Ito reopen the case. He was extremely
: anxious to air some testimony which he
I believed would bolster Braunhart's posi
tion. After considerable argument Judge
Graham decided to allow the defense to \
reel oss-examlne J. P. McGovern. He was
asked if he ever accepted money from
J;imes Cannon in return for a position
lin the Fire Department. McOovem em
' phatically denied that he had, and stated
1 that the only money he ever received
from that source Was in payment of gro
cery bills. _____________

LAID TO REST

Special DisDatch to The Call.
SALINAS, Sept. 21.â funeral of i
Sheriff Henry R. Farley, who was killed
on Monday night by George Suisser, was
held this morning.
All the stores, business houses, black
smith shops and even saloons closed their
doors from 9 to 12 o'clock, while on every
public building as well as on all hotels
find private residences flags were flying at
half mast. Never before has this county
seen such a large funeral. Excursions
were run from Gonzales. San Lucas and !â 
other points south and also from Men- [
terey and Pacific Grove, while all the i
country folk for miles around gathered j
to attend the funeral.
In consequence of the inadequateness of
the Presbyterian church, where the ser
vices were to be held, the use of the arm
ory was obtained, and before the hour for I
the ceremonies to commence the place was
crowded. The public schools were closed
for half a day and the children marched
in solemn procession behind the hearse.
The religious services at the armory were
conducted by Revs. George McCormick.
Philo Phelps and E. B. Hatch of this city
and Rev. E. S. Robertson of Gonzales. The
Odd Fellows had charge of the funeral,
while the Native Sons acted as escort.
Both county and city officials turned out.
Something never before seen in the his
tory of this place was the suspension of
business in Chinatown. All of the Chi
nese stores were closed during the fore
noon, and in the procession a great many
Chinese were to he seen. Several of the
'â¢'companies" sent floral tributes, while
some of the members even viewed the
remains as they lay in state at the ar- I
mory. One and all throughout the whole
county loved Sheriff Farley. Fully 3000
people attended the funeral, and the pro
cession was about an hour in passing a
given point.
Mrs. Farley,' the aged mother of the
deceased, tells of a touching scene that
took place yesterday. Mrs. Farley was
Informed that two little . boys wished to
see her. They appeared to be not over
9 years old. barefooted and poorly clad
looking as if they had no mother to care
for them. Each carried a tiny bouquet of
wild c flowers. One of them, who acted as
spokesman, said: "We liked Mr. Farley i
just as good as everybody. We got these I
little bunches of flowers. They ' ain't
much among all of them big bouquets and
things, but It's all we could get. Won't
you please take them and put them on
the grave for us?"
The story . told by the little fellows
deeply touched Mrs. Farley's heart. She '
told them that she greatly appreciated
their simple offering and would do as
they requested. They went away satis
fied, after taking a farewell look at their
friend. > 7 :
ELDER SUISSER ALSO
LODGED IN JAIL
SALINAS. Sept. 21.â Charles Suisser,
eldest son of Jacob Sulsser and brother
of the slayer of Sheriff Farley, was ar
rested this afternoon In Blanco, a small
town west of this city. He was brought
here on a charge of having threatened
the life of James Delaney, the man who
was assaulted by George Suisser on the
night of the murder.
Delaney, who is 75 years old, asserts
that both the Suisser boys have been his
enemies for a long time. He says the
whole trouble which eventually terminat
ed in the death of Farley began when the
Suisser boys stole a set of harness from
him. He says the elder Suisser was as
desperate a character as his brother, and
has almost as many offenses to answer
for. The man arrested to-day was
brought Into court and held under $2000
bonds.
Charles Suisser, it is asserted by those
who profess to know, has made the threat
thai if his hrother George is lynched he
will have revenge. The eldest Suisser boy
was implicated in a fight with his brother
some time ago and stabbed him, but still
both boys were great companions never
theless.

The Republican delegation of thÂ«
Thirty-fourth District met last evening- at
Native Sons' Hail, on Mission street. J.
Iv. C. Hobbs presided. The purpose of the
meeting was to listen to the report of a
committee of four named at the last meet
ing of the district to attend a meeting: of
the other Mission districts, which took
place last week; also to hear what candi
dates for office who might present them
selves might have to gay. The report of
the committee was taken up first there
being no candidates present. Chairman
liobbs reported that no one was pledged
at the meeting of the Mission districts.
The â¢wo candidates of the Thirty-fourth
IJistnct for Supervisors, Messrs. Martin
Jones and George T. Shaw, were named.
The district wanted to have these men
nominated by the convention, and also
would want something else. The commit
tee to confer with the other Mission dis
tricts consisted of George W. Elder, P.
Kresky F Weibel, C. Raycnester and J.
K. C. HobÃs.
George W. Elder reported also concern- i
Ips. the conference. The districts that !
had conferred were the Thirty-first,
Thirty-fifth, Thirty-sixth and Thirty- ;
seventh with the Thirty-fourth. It had !
been agreed upon, Mr. Elder said, that
all the Mission delegates would attend
a caucus to be held, when every Mission
district will name Its favorite sons for
Supervisors. The Mission will put in a
claim for six Supervisors, on the ground
that the Mission contains a third of the
â¢voting population of the city and county.
That much was agreed upon at the first
meeting of the Mission district delega
tions. Mr. Elder also reported for the
committee that the next meeting of the
Mission districts would take place next i
week upon the call of the chairman. The
report of the committee was accepted.
Later in the evening candidates for
nominations arrived and talked to the
delegates, among them being Harry Baehr,
who is a candidate tor the nomination
for Tax Collector, and W. S. Leyle, who
Is a candidate for the nomination for
Public Administrator.
The delegates elected to the Republican
Municipal Convention from the Thirty
sixth Assembly District met last night
at the residence of E. P. Mahoney, 1302
Castro street. The following aspirants
lor nomination addressed the delegates
and solicited their support: D. L. Farns
worth and C. U. pew for Supervisor,
John Farnham and John A. Drinkhouse
for Public Administrator, Wiibur G.
Doar.e for Auditor, Harry Baehr for Tar
Collector and James Nagle for Police

The members of the First California
Regiment, who were mustered out of the
service yesterday, have already taken up
the duties of citizenship and propose to

LOUISA SCHLEGEL DIED
FAR AWAY FROM HOME
EIGKrEI-^N-year-old Louisa Schlegel ml found lying- dead on the floor of
her room yesterday morning. She was a domestic In the home
of N K. Masten, 221S Clay street. Mr Miisten is president of the Mari
copa and "phoenix and Suit River Valley Railroad Company.. The body
Of th â¢â¢ dead girl was discovered by -Mary O'Farrell, a nurse In the fam
ily. J'iss O'Farrell went to Louisa's room to call her, she not having
made her appearance at the usual hour; and when the nurse entered the room
she found- th. body of Miss Schlegel lying on the floor, a few feet from
the door. The body was attired in a night gown, and the shoes and stockings
had not been :-iken off. Fumes of illuminating ges rendered the air of the
room Insupportable^ and Miss O'Farrell was obliged to retreat. A physician was
suminor.<:<l, and r.e at once pronounced the girl dead.
Attach..! to the gas fixtures was a patent lighting device operated with a
chain. The stop< ->ck v.-as turned partly on, and showed how the unfortunate
young viroman hai met her death. On a desk v.ere ink, pens and paper and
an unfinished letter written by Miss Schlcgci. It was to a friend In Kansas
named Maggie, ar.i contained a description of the trip made by the deceased
a little more than two months ago In coming fro.-o Eudora, Kans., to 'this
city. The letter wta in a cheerful vein, and the writer had mentioned that she
was so tired at nijht after the work of the day that she could hardly keep
her eyes open.
It is supposed that thÂ« girl had grown sleepy before she had finished copy
ing the letter on a e'ean sheet of paper, and that she hastily turned off the
gas and turned it on *},'am. hot knowing it. The deceased came to this city
from her parents' hoae in Kansas, and found employment at the homo of the
Hastens a month latei. They speak highly of her as a faithful and industrious
servant.
Mr. Masten has communicated with the mother of the deceased and has
taken charge of the futeral arrangements.
SHOT HIS FRIEND TO DEATH
OVER A TRIFLING DISPUTE
DECATJSE.of a quarrel over a tri
vial matter, Warren Main, bar-
II tender, shot and killed William
"^"^ Kennedy, a substitute fireman on
engine 10, In the Challenger saloon at
232 Third street yesterday afternoon.
The shooting 1 was unprovoked, and
the only extenuating circumstance is
that Main was under the Influence of
liquor at the time. Kennedy was sU'.n
without warning, and it Is believed
that the taking of his life was pre
meditated, as the trouble over which
the shooting took place began on the
previous night.
According to the statements given
to the police both men indulged In
word? Wednesday night. Main, r.'ok
narriod ."Tack" Main, was the night
bartender and was on duty. Kennedy,
otherwise known as "Spider," who had
previously been his friend, was Visit
ing in the saloon. One word brought
on another, and soon the dispute
warm. The proprietor of the
house finally quelled the disturbance.
Both men took drinks together and
parted apparently In a friendly man
ner. N
Main ar.d the man he killed had both
been drinking heavily on the evening
Of the trouble, and when they left the
place after a settlement they were ex
ceedingly drunk. Yesterday after
noon they returned to the saloon and
proceeded to regain the Intoxication
they had lost in sleep during the
-. During their stay In the
drinking house the dispute of the past
night was referred to and the quarrel
was renewed. Main finally drew a 3S
caliber bulldog revolver from his
pocket and, walking over to the end
of the bar, struck Kennedy on the
face with the butt of It. Kennedy,
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 22, 1899.
not thinking his assailant was in
st or sought his life, remarked:
"Tack, this has gone too far. What
are you doing that for? If you want
to use that thing kill me. I don't give
a d If I die right here."
Hardly had he finished the words
than the report of the pistol was
heard and Kennedy fell backward in
sensible to the floor. The bartender,
Hijgh Daugherty. sprang from behind
the bar and eeizir.g- Main took the pis
tol from him. The latter walked out
of the door and was not seen again
until two hours afterward, when he
was captured by the police. Officer
O'Callaghan, who heard the shot, was
n the scene and he hastily
summoned the ambulance from the
Central station and reported the es
cape of the murderer. When the of
ficer entered the saloon he found Ken
nedy unconscious ar.d bleeding from
the mouth. The bullet had entered
his body Immediately above the left
breast and probably perforated the
aorta. When the ambulance arrived
Kennedy was placed aboard, but he
died before the vs&gon reached Mis
sion street.
Meanwhile Main's room In the Cus
ter House was being searched, but
the shooter could not be apprehended.
It was reported that he would start
for San Jose, where his home Is, aÂ«d
detectives were sent to watch every
exit from the city. Sergeant McManus,
Detective Ryan and Special Officer
Con Kelly were detailed to the depot
at Third and Townsend streets. The
latter two officers were going to take
the next train to San Jose and watch
that city for their man. As the trio
were passing down Third street, near
Bryant, about 5 o'clock, the object of
their search came in sight and he was
Immediately placed under arrest. As
soon as the officers reached him he
Inquired if his man was dead, and on
being told that he was said, "Well, he
said he would kill me Inside of twenty
four hours."
Main was taken to the Central
Police Station and booked. Upon his
arrival there he was too intoxicated to
talk, except to repeat that he had
shot Kennedy because the latter had
threatened his life, and also to state
that after the shooting he had boarded
a Harrison street car going west.
About 8 o'clock last night he was seen
in his cell, but absolutely refused to
make any explanation of the crime. He
still -contended that Kennedy was go
ing to "do" him inside of twenty-four
hours, but refused to state when the
threat was made. The proprietor of
the saloon in which the trouble came
to its fatal termination says the
murderer Is a man who is very mo
rose, and that on three occasions he
attempted to take his life. The pro
prietor further stated that Main had
drawn a revolver on him several
times, but had never done any dam
age.
There were about three witnesses to
the shooting besides the bartender,
Daugherty. One of them, James Coin
ford, residing: at 1023 Montgomery
street, says that the shooting was un
provoked and that 'he heard the con
versation between the two men. Coin
ford states that Main deliberately
walked up to Kennedy and struck him
across the face. The latter did not
even make a motion to defend himself
but simply spoke to Main, telling him
that if he wished to use his gun, to
shoot, and Main instantly fired. All
parties agree that the two men had
been good friends previous to the little
dispute which ended in death, and at
tribute the murder to Main's intoxi
cated condition.
Kennedy lived at 217 1 * Tehama street
He was well liked by his associates
and acquaintances, and was a man
who never provoked trouble. He was
about M years of age, and leaves a
mother. At one time he was somewhat
of a celebrity as a local pugilist but
lately was appointed as a substitute on
Engine 10. His slayer is a sickly man,
about 30 years of age, weighing about
125 pounds. He has the appearance of
one addicted to the use of drugs His
features are drawn and his nose very
prominent. That he did not take his
life after having committed the deed
was a surprise to those who knew him,
and is due, perhaps, to the fact that he
was disarmed before he had a chance
to further any designs which he may
have had. "â¢:â â â¢*.â ;> "â  â â¢â¢ : -- â â -â 
SAVED FROM DISGRACE
BY HAND OF DEATH
ENSIGN COLEMAN, Whose Wayward Career Is Ended.
ENSIGN NOAH T. COLEMAN of the lowa is dead. The end cam*
yesterday morning at 1 o'clock at the McNutt Sanitarium. With thÂ«
passing of the young naval officer ends a career that in the begin
ning gave promise of being an honorable and a brilliant one. but hi!
history as an officer of Uncle Sam hn.i reached a point where dls
grace, complete and humiliating, confronted him. Death happily in
tervened to spare him the pain and the punishment which surely would hav>
been the fruit of his wayward career.
Some weeks ago. while awaiting court-martial. Coleman attempted tc
end his troubles by sending a bullet through his brain. His hand was un
steady and the leaden missile did not even draw blood. At the time thÂ«
young man's unhappy situation had weighed heavily on his mind and his
reason had almost fled. His brain became Affected. Hr pank gradually un
til his condition grew precarious and the Burgeons on the ship had hlrr
removed to the McNutt Sanitarium. This occurred about a week ago.
As though the fatea had taken compassion on the young officer in th<
hour of hie misfortune and would allow hl>= last hours to be passed in peace
the shade was drawn over the pages of his life that recorded his manx
mis-steps. The troubles that had driven him mad were obliterated from hiÂ«
mii.d. A loss of reason robbed the end of its bitterness. Coleman hac
passed into an unconscious condition some days before he was removed
to the sanitarium, and up to the time when death made its call he re
mained in a comatose state.
The relatives of Coleman live in Syracuse. N. T. His family fs one
of tho oldest in the Empire State. When it was almost certain that the
young man could not live, his father was advised of his condition by tele
graph and is now on his way to San Francisco. He is expected to arrive
here to-morrow. The remains have been removed to the Golden Gate under
taking parlors, 2121 Mission street, but no arrangements for the funeral will
be made until the fatru-r arrives.
Dr. Wiaslow Anderson, who had charge of the case at the sanitarium
pays that death was due to cerebral meningitis superinduced by the youns
man's excessvs and the fact that worry aver his pending court-martial had
aftected hi.Â« mind. Ihe pistol shot he aimed at himself had nothing to dc
with his doath. the doctor Bays, for the reason that the bullet did not even
graze the flesh and produced no wound whatever.
Coleman had no friends or relatives in this city, and no one went tc
visit him while he was on his deathbed at the hospital. He was about 27
years of age and a native of New York. He was sent to the Naval Acad
emy from that State. The first scandal in which he was Involved after join
ing the navy was in connection with the "blown" armor plates. His father
spent much of his fortune in defending his wayward son from the ugly
charges against him, growing out of that transaction. When the lowa was
BÂ«nt to the Pacific Coast Coleman came with her. At Seattle he heramf
involved in trouble with his superior officers and his case was reported to
Washington. The court-martial was set for trial on the Badger on the day
in which he attempted suicide. The trial took place later, but the findings
of the Judges were never made public.

No Change in Strike
of Boilermakers.
There was no change In the boilennak
ers' strike yesterday. The men will not
yield and the managers of the different
Iron works are not prepared to accept
eight hours as a day's work. The boiler
makers now assert that the demand will
be made to apply to all outside Jobs.
There will In consequence probably be a
general strike all along the front to-day.
i The men object to having their trouble
: with the bosses called a "strike"; they
assert that it is in reality a "lockout."
They assert that thpy are willing to go
back to work at a moment's notice. All j
| they want is what the contractors will I
not give themâ an eight-hour day with
pay for ten hours and double time for
overtime at the same ratio.

chances In the matter and all vessels

work done elsewhere or else they will

Moyune are coming here from the Orient,
but all the work on them will be done
in Hongkong. The Anglo Australian, now
In Austrlian waters, will probably be
overhauled In Sydney; and so it will be
with others. The "strike," or "lockout" |
âit matters not which it is calledâ has
begun to harm this port already, and this
1b only the beginning. The aooaer the
matter Is adjusted the better It will be
for all concerned.
No one here seems to know what Is
going to be done with the hospital ship
Relief. Yesterday she was to have sailed '
for Manila. During the morning word '
came from Washington to hold her here i
until the 2Cth inst. Later in the day an
other message came saying that noth- ;
ing at all was to be done with the yes- !
sel. pending instructions from the Secre- i
tary of War. The hospital ship will re
main tied up at the wharf for some time
to come.
Two new cases of smallpox broke out
at the camp of the Thirty-first Regiment
on Angel Island yesterday, and in con
sequence the transport Grant has been
ordered to the quarantine station to be ;
fumigated. She has all the belongings
of the men of the Thirty-first Regiment
aboard. These will be unloaded to the
quarantine hulk, and after being fumi
gated will be sent back to the quarter
master. The Grant will probably be re
leased to-day and will then come back
to the Government wharf, where another
regiment will be put aboard and she will
start for Manila.
The quartermaster's steamer General
McDowell is now engaged solely in car- â¢
rylng water and supplies to the deten- ;
tion camp. The tug Sea Queen In the
meantime Is making the McDowell's trips
to the army posts. A rigid quarantine
Is maintained at the detention camp, no
one from the outside being allowed nearer .
than the Government wharf.
The transport Senator sailed for Ma- '
nila yesterday with a portion of the lowa ' ;
regiment aboard. The boys should ar- j :
rive here about September 22. i

JOHN BARRETT
ADDRESSES THE
BUSINESS MEN
â¢
Problems of Oriental
Commerce.
Every seat In the Chamber of Com-
merce meeting hall was occupied yester
day by attentive iisteners, who had come
together to hear John Barrett, ex-United
States Minister to Siam, talk of the East,
trade conditions and commercial possi
bilities.
Preceding the address of the speaker of
the day George A. Newhall, who is vice
president of the association, sa!d a few
complimentary things about the guest i
and then introduced Mayor Phelan, who ;
likewise praised Mr. Barrett, commenting i
upon his views and the splendid opportu- l
nlties afforded him for the study of the i
trade question in the Orient. When the
applause which greeted the introduction
of Mr. Barrett by the Mayor had sub
sided the visitor arose and said in part:
I feel a little embarrassed after hearing- so
many complimentary things said about me, but
It Is true that I am a firm believer in the
future greatness of San Francisco. It Is not |
my purpose to indulge in a political or moral
argument. We are gathered here to consider
the material side of the question, to consider
the opportunities for the extension of our com
mercial relations with 500,000,000 people and a I
magnificent coast line that is almost unmeas
nimble. San Francisco Is directly opposite both, i
and as It grows out of the period of swaddling i
clothes it must feel the wonderful opportunities |
offered it. The great Interest of the Paoiiic j
Coast demands the attention of the entire
country, and I think to-day that people all
over the world are realizing that the Pacific
States have an Integral interest. At this time
there Is an imperative demand that the people !
of Oregon Washington and California must I
work together. If this State shall have the !
full Influence It should possess it must have '
its full quota of United States Senators The !
best Interests of thi? State demand another
Senator to work for the benefit of California.
Unless the people of the State have their full 1
quota tt will be crippled, as I believe this com- :
ing Congress will evolve a policy which will i
bear directly upon the interests of the coast, i
This coast must take the leadership In promul- j
gating the construction of a Nicaragua canal, !
a Pacific cable and trade relations with the j
Orlert.
All over the country the people are only too j
glad to listen to the development of commerce '
on the Pacific. That is why I say we should I
lead and show the great majority what the
true interests of the Pacific Coast are and how
k reaches them.
The great countries o? Europe are in every
way possible using their Influence to develop
Oriental commerce. The best men the big- Eu- ,
ropean cities have are being sent to the East
for the purpose of securing this trade. The
greatest opportunity of commerce In the Orient :
belongs to America, but it can only be won
by competition and energ-etic spirit. To-day i
we are proving that it is possible for us to i
compete with the world.
Mr. Barrett then considered the Ori- '
ental countries seriatim and spoke of the
great commercial possibilities presented
to Americans. In regard to the Philip
pines he found the same conditions exist
ing. Continuing he said:
No other country of the Orient has such a '
variety of products and it Is nothing more :
than reasonable to suppose that we should de- '
velop these resources. AH foreign houses m !
Manila are preparing- to double their invest- ;
ments. This is an index. With the develop-
EMnt of railroads will come development of
resources and trade.
I look forward to a co-operation between the
Pacific Coast and the Orient. I would have a I
Urge number of young- Filipinos corr.e to this â 
country, educate them and let them learn what
tbts country Intends with them. Upon their
return more would be done to satisfy the na- ;
tlves than years of colonizing. When you con- '
stder the Filipino's actions you must "consider
the years of tyranny under which he lived. I i
look forward to the time when the energy of :
Americans, without any Jingoism, will assert I
Itself and face their responsibility In the
Orient.
What you merchants must do is to send men,
strong agent 6, out there, and then you will i
find the greatest results. Send qualified agents :
and do not spare a few extra dollars in ex- ;
pense in getting the right men. There should
b-i established here an exchange museum
Which would show what the Orient and Its
products are. Tou muet have larger and faster '
ships to cross the Orient. Seattle, Tacoma <
and Portland are preparing to do it and you i
must. I would like to see San Francisco a
free port. Just as soon as possible the Pacific :
cable must be laid. Tour Senators and Con- ;
gressmen must demand it. Just as soon as ;
this is accomplished your trade will Jump with i
a mighty ieap.
As to the Nicaragua canal, unless you work i
for it you will never get it. Opposition In the i
East is working against it, ar.d It Is a strong
opposition.
Without any flattery the California Regiment
made a record for Itself. The men of the West ;
from California, performed their duties In a I
way that brought out the commendation of !
Admiral Dewey in no restricted terms They i
were always eager to reach the firing line and
never shirked the work marked out for them.
Mr. Barrett closed with a eulogy- of th*
California Regiment ard he was followed I
by Senator Carter of Montana, who spoke ;
at some length about American progres-
Bion, and the trend of history.
COFFEY NOT SATISFIED.
Wants More Affidavits From Attor
neys Hart and Fox.
Attorneys W. H. H. Hart and George
W. Fox must file additional affidavits be
fore they can convince Judge Coffey that
he is prejudiced against Laura, the al
eged contract widow of the late Charles
A. James or that he decided her contest
jnfavoraMy to her without due consider
ation of the evidence. Yesterday after
noon George D. Shadburne, who repre
sents the absent heirs in the James
;state, filed a counter affidavit in which
le contested the claim that Judge Coffey
Jailed to consider the opinion of Expert
Hopkins, who testified that in his opinion
:he signature on the alleged marriage
:ertificate was genuine. The affiant
jointed to the testimony of Guptav Falte,
uaying teller of the German Bank, and A.
K. Whittle of the San Francisco Savings
LJnion, both of whom pronounced the sig
lature a forgery. In conclusion Shad-
Durne says that he does not believe that
Hart is of the opinion that the court is
prejudiced.
When the hearing of the affidavits was
alien up the court was not satisfied with
he points made in the affidavits and gave
:he complainants until Wednesday in
ivhich to file additional statements re
garding his Honor's prejudice.
MRS. CRAVEN AGAIN LOSES.
Mrs. Nettle R. Craven, who claims to
je the widow of the late James G. Fair,
ws met defeat for a second time before
ludge Troutt on Important preliminary
â natters on which Ehe hoped to base her
Ight to prove her alleged relationship to
:he deceased. A few weeks ago the court
lecided that Mrs. Craven could not re
jover her costs expended In advertising
summons in her suit against the estate,
feeterday the court denied her motion to
racate the order of partial distribution of
.â¢state properties made April 13. IS'JT. Had
Sirs. Craven's motion been granted the
ieirs of the estate would have been de
prived of the income of the property,
vhich i? valued at several million dollars,
'or an indefinite period. Mrs. Craven's j
implication for JSOOO a month as a family ]
illowance from the estate will bo heard
his morning. The heirs are determined
ntest this application to the end. for
: Mrs. Craven was granted this allow
ince it would be an acknowledgment of
ler relationship to the deceased and his
â hildren are not anxious to aoknnw:
hat she is indeed their stepmother.

New York Money Market.
The New York circular of Henry Clews Bays:
"We cannot be certain that anything now
remains to our credit of the large balance I
arising from our extraordinary surplus of ex
ports over Imports; on the contrary, there are
Indications that the return of our securities
has about liquidated that balance, and we
have for some time been closely verging upon
the possibility of an outflow of gold to Eu- j
rope.
"While these external possibilities confront â 
ns. the condition of the home money market
la not assuring. The extraordinary revival of
business has caused a corresponding expan
sion of bank loans and has at the same tim&
Increased the demand for currency in the
retail circulation. With a banking system
that indirectly compels the banks to augment
their stocks of lawful money In proportion
as they extend their loans, we are brought
face to face with an acute scarcity in tlie
circulating medium. The universal employ
ment of the working classes at rising rates of
wages, the Increased holdings of cash among
country retailer?, and the rapid rise In the
prices of goods have conjointly produced a i
necessity for an expansion of the volume of
money; and this need makes Itself felt at ,
the moment when the banks of the Interior
are drawing their deposits from the metro- ;
politan banks In order to facilitate the mar
keting of large crops of cotton and cereals. !
â Unfortunately, we have no effective resource
for Increasing the amount of the money cir- j
culation in order to- satisfy these necessities;
and the result appears In a reduction of the
cash reserves of the New York banks to close j
upon the *Â«!ead line 1 at a point about mid- j
way, In the usual fall efflux of money to the
agricultural sections.
"This is not a promising situation. Un
expectedly, we are brought to a condition of
things In which the national prosperity threat
ens to be seriously crippled through the legal
restraints upon our banks and by the in
elasticity of our currency arrangements. Had
our laws relating to note circulation been
such as to admit 0$ an expansion of bank is
sues proportioned to the wants of the crop â¢
movement, there need have been none of the
draining of the lawful money reserves of the
metropolitan banks which is now In process;
and thÂ» compulsory contraction of loans, and
the stringency in money and the exhaustion
of the reserves would have been easily avoid
able. At Its coming session Congress may
find reason enough in the present situation
for far more thorough measures of currency
and banking reform than appear to be enter
tained by members claiming to be leaders in
financial reconstruction.
"What, however, most concerns Wall street
at the moment is not so much that we are
confronting a theoretically faulty system of
finance as that we stand face to face with
a delicate and difficult financial situation.
Two millions of surplus reserve and 8 to 9
per cent for call loans at the middle of Sep
tember are ugly and disquieting facts.- The
situation cornea so near to a deadlock that
there must be some yielding somewhere in
order to avert very unwelcome conditions. It
would be Indulging a frail hope to expect ef
fectual relief from Importations of gold. The
situation of the foreign exchanges hardly sug
gests such a probability. A fall in the prices
of securities, or cotton, or cereals might no
etimulate exports as to bring exchange to the
gold importing point: but who would desire to
nee gold procured at such a cost? and relief
could not come from such a source until It
â¢was too late to be of much service. Nor
Is It possible for the Secretary of the Treasury
to afford any help to the situation beyond
prepaying some $5,600,000 of Interest due of
the first of October; which, though a rela
tively small palliative, would be a valuable
aid under the circumstances. Much, however,
may be hoped from the resourceful expedients
of the banks, which were never stronger o.r
more effectively administered than to-day. ThÂ«
fledgling corporations which, pending the re
cent extreme ease in money, obtained a cer
tain recognition among lenders, must expect
to take care of themselves; and the relief from
that resource to borrowers more entitled to
consideration may prove to be quite lmport
"The situation calls for caution, but does
not warrant alarm."

EASTERN MARKETS
New York Stock Market.
I NTTW YORK, Sept. 31â The tone of the
trading In stocks was much quieter to-day
i than for some time past. No such pressure
of forced liquidation was observable as yes
terday and several preceding days. As a re
sult there was a very general and substantial
recovery In prices. There was a large demand
from the extensive outstanding short Interest
and probably this constituted a principal ele
ment in the recovery, but there was also a
very good absorption of some of the railroad
stocks, which had the appearance of coming
from large Interests who were satisfied to take
on stocks at the present level. Brooklyn Tran
sit continued to comprise a large proportion
of the dealings and the cessation of pres
sure against It and other members of Its
group had an Important Influence In the re
covery in prices. A revised Interpretation of
New York's new franchise bill, which would
beat less heavily on corporations than had
been expected, found general acceptance among
speculators. The enormous selling for some
time past of Brooklyn Transit gave color to
some current rumors that the control of the
property has changed to new and strong hands.
Those two influences were effective in reliev
ing the local traction stocks from the fierce
attacks to which they have been subjected
for many days past, and removed from the
situation the most potent element of depres
sion. The bears made some effort to contest
the advance and they found vulnerable spots
in People's Gas, Sugar, Tobacco and Tennes
see Coal. But their success in affecting the
general market was very moderate and their
efforts to cover in the very stocks which they
had attacked helped on the late advance. In
the railroad list aggressive buying first devel
oped In Southern Pacific, but an excellent de
mand spread to other points In the list, not
ably the grangers, which are all up from 1
to VJk on the day. There were notable move
ments in Pullman, which rose 8 7 and Ana
conda, which jumped *H points in the late
market on the declaration of a dividend. Chi
cago, Indianapolis and Louisville stocks gained ,
2% and 2% ' respectively. The Chicago Great
â Western stocks showed rather sensational de
clines, but later rose above yesterday's level,
except for debentures, which are off 4 points.
London was a seller In the early dealings
owing to anxiety over to-morrow's meeting
of the British Cabinet, and thus aided the
bears In the early part of the day. A favor
able effect was exercised by the reported pur
chase In London of $500,000 of gold in the open
market for shipment to New York. No trace
could be found of the destination of this
shipment, and foreign exchange houses main
tained that gold could not yet be imported at
a profit. Sterling exchange dropped a frac
tion nearer the gold Import point, but Is still
â¢well over one cent above that level. The
call loan rate in New York dropped late in
the day, after the day's demand for money
had been practically all met. But the con
dition of the local money market was not
materially changed. A drop In New York ex
change In Chicago indicated renewed pressure
from that source for funds. Saturday's bank
statement is now expected to show the New
York banks In a somewhat stronger position.
The bond market was firm In tone. Total
sales, par value. $1,256,000. .

Chicago Grain Market.
CHICAGO. Sept. 21.â Partly on account of
misunderstanding in regard to the Northwest
receipts and partly on the advance at Liver
pool, wheat opened strong and at a substantial
advance, December %c higher at 71%tf?71'sc
and September %c. higher at 72c. Duluth re
ceipts were placed at but 145 cars, and the to
tal at both Northwest points at 556 cars, which
induced considerable covering by shorts, the
falling off being totally unexpected. Minne
apolis figures were in error, however, and the
total was corrected to 884 cars, against 878 last
week and 931 a year ago. This amount was
heavy enough to induce some selling by the
early buyers and prices sagged for a time, De
cember declining to 71 cents. About an hour
after the opening the market, which in the
meantime had been gradually rising on heavy
buying by Barrett & Farnum, who were said
to be heavily short, was startled by the an
nouncement of their failure, atid in an Instant
the pit was In an uproar. It was reported the
suspended firm was short at least 5,000 k OOO
bushels, although heavy buying for their ac
count was done early In the session, and this
fact caused the December price to jump from
about 71'^c, to which point it had previously
advanced, to 73 cents, and then to 73% c, in an
exceedingly short time. For some time the
market ran wild. The price changed with great
rapidity under an enormous amount of trad
ing, December dropping to 72<4c, back to 72% c,
then to 72c, and up again' to 72% c. It was
estimated that about 3,000,000 busheVs were
bought for the account of the distressed firm
in about ten minutes. The skyward opening
brought all clanses of shorts into the market.
The flurry over the failure gradually subsided
and December settled back to 71 7 /Â»c. During the
latter part of the sesston wheat was almost at
a standstill and prices kept within an extreme
ly narrow range. During the bulge in Decem
ber September had advanced tr> 73% con a very
s-mall amount of business. Offers to sell about
25.000 bushels September later brought no bids
and the prices was forced down to 70%e. but it
later recovered to and closed at 72c. Decem
ber held firm at about 71T*c and closed at that
price.
Corn was slightly affected by the excitement
Incidental to the failure, and fair advances re
sult inp during the morning. The Interest of the
suspended firm was small In corn, however, and
later prices settled back. December closed a
shade higher, but September lost V*c.
Oats were also somewhat affected by the
wheat flurry and prices ruled higher all day,
December closing \Â»c up.
Provisions were about steady all day. with
little trading either way. The market started
firm. It weakened a little later on sales at
tributed to Barrett & Farnum, but later ral
lied and closed steady. The cash demand for
meats continued good. At the close January
pork was a shade lower and lard and ribs 2%c
higher each.

LONDON, Sept. 21.â The offerings at the
wool auction sales to-day amounted to 11,851
bales. France was less conservative and oper
ated freely In merinos, but the home trade se
cured the bulk of this grade. Prices hardened
all around, fcoured locks and pieces especially
bringing full figures. Crossbreds commanded
great attention, and the finest qualities were
heM at rates higher than the opening. Ger
many competed with the home trade for suit
able* pircels. Coarse wool sold quickly and
advanced in to 15 per cent above the July
average. Yorkshire was a strong buyer.
France secured moderate lines and Ainerlca
about 100 bags. Sllpes sold well at 7>^ per
cent advance and short coarse wools at barely
5 Cape of Good Hope and Natal was in
small supply and when offered brought out
strong competition. Most of the offerings con
sisted of scoured, and the price rose 10 to 15
per cent.

WOULD HAVE
SCRATCHED OUT
JANE'S EYES
Bitterness in Hodge-
Nxholi Suit
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway. Sept. 21.
It la likely that the $50,000 breach of
promise damage suit of Jane Hodge
against John Nicholl, the ag'Xl capital
ist, will go to the jury some time to-mor
row. The taking of testimony was con
cluded early this afternoon, and after
a recess Attorney Emll Xusbaumer of
counsel for the plaintiff began his argu
ment before the jury. He made .in elo
quent and forceful plea, picturing by
words the cruel manner in which the aged
"Duke of Richmond" had lacerated the
affections of his client by breaking the
engagement of marriage. When the at
torney reached that phase of the case
which treated of Mr. Nlclioll's feebleness
he gracefully warned the many women
who had thronged the courtroom that his
closing words of the day might not be
pleasing to them, and so they retired to
the corridors. To-morrow Mr. Xusbaumer
will close his argument, when Attorneys
Mhoon and McKee will argue for the de
fense. Colonel Foote will probably make
the closing argument.
During this morning's session Miss Ma
de Xicholl. daughter of defendant, was
recalled by the prosecution to take the
stand to tell how she came to write let
ters for her father to Miss Hodge. She
said that her father suggested she write
them from his dictation. She admitted
that before mailing these spicy epistles
they had been submitted to Attorney Ma
jor Mhoon, who had suggested a few
changes. She st .ed too that the first
mention she had ever made to her father
about having learned of the engagement
was on the first Monday in December.
Miss Hessie Xlcholl, another daughter
of the defendant was next called. She
too told what had taken place at Jane
Hodges home at the time the latter an
nounced the engagement to heL. "I asked
Jane when she was coming over to our
house." said Miss Hessie, "and then she
asked if Mazie had not told me of the
engagement, and 1 said 'yes.' Jane said:
"I hear you girls are mad at me.' 'Why?'
1 asked." She said: 'Because I am going
to marry your fatherâ didn't he tell you?
I said: "'No, he did not. You know, Jane.
v;e could never get along together. Do
you expect to com? Into our home?' She
said: 'Yes, I suppose so; but you know
your father would never turn you girls
but.' I said: 'I don't see why father
wants to get married," and she said: 'You
know how ardent he is.' I said:
'Jane, you know he is an old man and is
not responsible for what he does.' She
said: â He knew what he was doing when
he hugged and kissed me the way he did.'
I said: 'We girls are very much averse
to putting anybody In our dear mother's
place,' and she said: 'I d"n't blame you;
if I were in your place I would kick like
a steer.' " Â ,
Witness then went on to tell about the
ride with her sister and Jane, during
which "everything was declared oft." Her
testimony here was quite similar to that
of Mazie' Nlcholl's given yesterday. She
too had kept tab on all talks had with
Jilne Hodge. ' ' . â '_.
Mrs Wilson, a married daughter of the
defendant, was called. She was present
at i].. little episode at the home of Mrs.
X L Boyd, when the latter had told her
of the engagement. Mrs. Wilson testified
that Mr- Boyd on that occasion had said:
"It is shameful. It's a disgrace. How
did you keep from scratching Jane's eyes
out?" Had 1 been In your place 1 would
The deposition of Miss Hodge, taken
some time ago before a notary, was next
read by Attorney Mboon, who thereafter
recalled Miss Hodge in rebuttal of the
testimony of Mazie and Hessie. She tes
tified that she had "never said to them
that her engagement with Mr. Nicholl
was conditional on their decision.

A BIBLICAL TEXT NOT
JUSTIFIED BY EVENTS
Oakt a\D SeDt TLâ Fred A Poor. Secretary of the State of Maine As
sociatlon; Is perhaps justly Incensed that a bank of his native State
should ruthlessly repudiate a $5 bill of Its own issue of September 1. 1837,
which he recently sent there for collection.
The bill In Question was brought to light some time ago from among the
effects of a widowed lady who had passed to the great beyond. It was in per
fect condition, and though the Hank of Maine that bad tesued it sixty-two
veara ago had surrendered its charter under the State, the institution under
ihe same name is now doing business as a national bank. This fact to
gether with the superstitious hopefulness created by th*- fact that the bill had
been found In the old departed souls Bible-right In the midst of the Book
of Job and directly under it the verse which reads, "For T know that my
redeemer liveth." had induced those Int. rested In the estate to send the note
back to its birthplace for redemption. Their chagrin and Bad disappointment
can he surmised when in dxw course the following reply came back: In all
probability the bill is not genuine. We stopped redeeming genuine ones twen
ty-flve years since."

NEVADA ANXIOUS TO
COPE WITH BERKELEY
BERKELEY, Sept 21.â The prospects
are good for an intercollegate football
match this year between the University
of California and the State University of
Nevada, it will not be a game between
the Berkeley freshmen and thq Nevada
varsity team, as in previous years Til.
Nevadans, with a crack player from the
University of Pennsylvania to coach
them, are anxious to face Berkeley's big
team It has not been settled yet whether
the Berkeley men go to Nevada, cr
whether the players from the Sagebrush
State expeel to come to the university
town More lik.-ly the latter will be the
case as the University of California
team can hardly take the time for a trip
out of rhe State before the next Thanks
eiving game.
Manager Saxton of the Nevadans was
at college yesterday making arraokements
with Football Manager Irwin .1. Minna.
The datÂ« set is for either the second \\ e<i

PRISON SALARIES REDUCED
Folsom Directors Give Employes a
Painful Surprise.
The Board of State Prison Directors
paid a quiet visit to Folsom Prison last
Wednesday and held a brief session, par
tikiriK somewhat of thf> nature of a sur
prise party. Without any previous warn
ing to Hiiy of the Interested parties, the
heads of four guards fell into the political
basket ami the salaries of even.- officer at
the. prison, except those of Warden Anil
ami Clerk Brainerd Smith, were reduced
in sums ranging from ir> to $25.
This action of the board came as a great
surprise to everybody connected with the
priibn, the affair being transacted so sud
denly that not only was nobody present
in anticipation of any excitement, but the
inivs of what bad actually taken place
was not made public until yesterday. The
step was taken by the board for two rea
sons â because of the diminution in the ap

BISHOP MORELAND ON
CHRISTIAN SCIENCE
DELIVERS A LECTURE IN ST.
JOHNS GUILD HALL.
Occasion Is the Quarterly Social of
the Parishioners of the
Church.
Rt. Rev. William H. Moreland. Bishop
of Sacramento, delivered an Interesting
lecture nn t'liristinn Science at the
quarterly Lecture of the parishioners at
St. John's church in the Guild Hall, Fif
teenth Street and Julian avenue, last
Digbt.
Rev. Dr. Spaldlng. rector of St. John's,
preside!! and introduced the lecturer with
a few remarks.
Bishop Morelnnri prefaced his lecture
with the statement that the acknow
ledged sincerity of Christian Scientists is
no reason why they should be encouraged
nr followed, declaring that the Turk Is
sincere when slitting the throat of the
Armenian, the atheisi sincere In denying
God and the <'hlnaman sincere In
Worshiping hip joss. He dwelt at length
upon the good and true elements which
enter into their belief and showed how
they were originally derived from the old
Christian faith. He discoursed upon the
varied forms of mental healing which
have been practiced in all ages and at
tributed them to a form of 'suggestive
therapeutics which Bdenee recognizes
and the regular school of medicine prac
tices. He emphasized the evils which fol
low in the train of Christian Science.
naming fis such Insanity, denial of God,
rejection "f Christ and of the Bible as
God's word, eftieminacy of character and
cruelty to the suffering. He Btated that
the real question at slake is persistently
obscured by the followers of this new
cult. It in not whether some people are
now living who might have died but tor
Christian Science. It is whether there
are people now in their graves who might
be alive to-day had it not been for this
delusion. Tho point is not that it is
wr^np to admit mental healing to the
bedside of a patient, but whether it i*
right to refuse all other treatment and
to let patient me rather than adtnlt a
physician. The last is Christian Science,
falsely so called, and it is madness and
folly.
The Bishop quoted a "Prayer for a
Dyspeptic' taken from a text hook on
mind cure issued by the president of tho
"New York School of Primitive and Prac
tical Christian Science." Dr. Hazzard.
who states that his school is free from
eccentricity and fanaticism, to show the
absurdity of the teachings of Christian
Scientist's.

cause the right is on my side.
Bbc has had cat-o"-nine-tails up her
sleeve for two years, always carrying it ;
when she goes out, watching for a chance |
to use It. She has threatened my life, \
too, and 1 have been urged by my friends j
who know these things to put her under |
bonds to keep the peace, but I would
rather stand everything than take any
steps against her. I have stood about
everything.
"I allowed her to obtain a divorce from
me although we were never married,
just in order to protect her god name,
and especially that of her children by a
marriage that occurred long before 1
became acquainted with her. I was will
ing to accept the disgrace in order to
protect her, but I have not received
much thanks for it. I never men
tioned this fact until T was asked by
Judge Greene if we were ever married.
Then, the truth came out so suddenly
that the woman was not prepared to
kill me in the courtroom, as she had
sworn to me that she would do. She
happened to be without a gun.
"She is some fifteen years older than
I am, and frightfully Jealous. Why, she
shot the man to whom she was really
married, the father of her two children,
â \V. P. Barnesâ in a San Fnuu-isco
theater a number of years ago. rt l i â â¢
shot him in the face, hut did not kill
him. I do not know that it is safe to

wood, a member of the Leonard party,
arrived from Alaska on the steamer
Bertha. He came direct from Cape Nome,
where his brother Clarence is now lo
cated. Mr. Sherwood expects to return
there next spring. He says the reports
from the beach mines have not been ex
aggerated. Men have made from $30 to
floi) per day, but the pay streak has been
pretty well worked out. and at the time
he left there no pay dirt had been found
on other portions of the beach.
Mr. Sherwood advises people not to go
to tin- northern gold fields unless they
have had previous experience there or
know just what they are going to do
when they get there. He reports a num
ber <>f Alamedans as doing well at Cape
Nome. J. C. Muther of Alameda had
erected a two-story business block nnd
was doing a large general merchandise
business. Dr. J. G. Humphreys, in con
nection with the dentist profession, is
practicing medicine and running a drug
store. Clarence Sherwood, who is inter
est.d with his brother Lionel in a num
bei of mining claims, is making $15 an
evening playing the violin. The other
membars of the Leonard party were all
doing well when Mr. Sherwood left for
Alameda.

BLOW FROM A
FOOL BULL MAY
CAUSE DEATH
Little Eddie Dunn's
Life Despaired.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Sept. 21.
As a result of three serious mishaps â
one of which may yet terminate in deatli
âat the baseball game between the Welch
& O'Brtena of this city and the Clear
Bros, of Berkeley, played last Sunday on
the filled-lB West Oakland marsh at the
fool of Cypress street, between P^ight
eenth and Nineteenth, a petition is being
circulated urging tbat the grounds, if tho
same are to be used for baseball sport,
I be inclosed in a suitable fence.
The game last Sunday, it appears, wa3
; noted for its fouls. One boy whose nami
was not ascertained sustained a broken
leg; Andrew Perry, a bricklayer, aged 22
years and residing at 1953 Magnolia street,
! sustained a bruken jaw, and lastly and.
i most seriously Eddie Dunn, the seven
year-old son of Patrick Francis Dunn,
residing at Nineteenth and Durant streets,
was Struck near the left eye so violently
that his life .-yen to-day is In jeopardy.
Little Eddie Dunn is under the cara of
two physicians, Drs. Kerrigan. His con
dition is such that it baa b seu deemed
, inadvisable to remove him to his own
parents 1 home from the residence of his
aunt, Mrs. Mathew Mason. 1416 Sixteenth
j street, where he had been spending a
week >n a visit.
The bali struck the child noar the left
â¢ temple, causing an ugly lacerated wound.
1 -which required five Pitches, and so seri
ously Impairing the left eye that he may
yet 'not only lose its sight but the eye
i.all as well.
Twice to-day, while the suffering child
was seated in the sun to regain Its
i strength, he fainted away, and his con
dition is such that it is feared he may
die. He requires constant watching, and
' his weak condition is principally due to
i the gnat l<>^s of blood h.- suffered. The
child appeared almost delirious over the
game, and after emerging from a two
hours' operation under chloroform asked
j in his childish way. "Who won?"
Til. 1 i t 1 1 . fellow is a particularly bright
child and had been attending Father Mc-
Nally's parochial school in West Oakland.

DODGE IS PREPARING
TO DO THE BABY ACT
The Holiest of All Assessors Is
Up Against the Real Figures.
Mas Cost the Taxpayers Almost Seven Hundred
Thousand Dollars More Than His
Predecessor.
~ SSESSOR WASHINGTON DODGE,
S\ realizing that figures do not lie, la
r^j trying the next best thing. He la
i endeavoring to got behind the re
turns. His first effort was made
yesterday, after reading the article
in Tho Call In which his stuffed assess
ment rrtll was riddled with facts and fig
urea until it was the sorriest looking lot
of shreds and patches that ever came out
of an Assessor's office. As has been his
â wont, he lapsed into figures; and, as has
been his luck, thÂ© figures are against him.
In a letter to thÂ© editor of this paper ha
states:
It la further stated In the article In yes
terday's (meaning Thursday's) Issue that
the assessment roll for this year 1b not i
materially Increased, after deducting those
sums represent ing property on which the
collection or taxes Is doubtful. This la an j
error.
Over $25,000,000 remains on
the roll In excess of last year's
roll, on -which it is certain that
taxes WILL BE COLLECTED.
80, according to Dodge's own statement,
made In his own defense, the excess over
act year's roll, which he only claims now
â  more than $25.0Q0j000, is not represented ,
by taxes collected In thÂ© treasury. At
east, ho confidently at thatâ -taxes
in this $25,000,000 WILL BE collected.
Notice that WILL BE
Now. if ho has not collected on this â¢
(25,000,000 excess, he has done no better, :
except on poll tax, taken mostly from the
poor, for the reason that they greatly
exceed the well-to-do, than his prede
cessor.
If that Is not an outright confession on ;
the part of "Juggler" Dodge that his roll |
was stuffed, what Is it? NamÂ© It, and
. ou can nave it. . _
Another dip into Dodge's letter of- de
fense doe* Dot help him any. -It shows
that he is not as clever with the type
writer as some people thought hÂ» was
with chalk on a blackboard before they
:ricd him in office. In another paragraph
he says:
The large amount of personal property,
which apparently remains delinquent on
the tax rolls at this time. Is the dlreot
result of my attempt to assess that class
of proj.erty, which has heretofore always
rsraped taxation. The law holds me per
ponally liable for my failure to collect these
taxess, no matter how strenuously I should
â¢â¢mJeaivor to do bo. I have made the at
tempt to collect taxes on this class of
property, such as bank stock and franÂ«
chisfs. with the full knowledge of my per.
Bosial liability under the- law should I fall
in my attempt to make this class of prop
erty contribute toward ring Its share
of the ex;*nses of this municipality.
Remember, Assessor Dodge is now do-
Ing his celebrated Juggling act. Keep i
your eyes on the ores, for he has whis- !
kers to deceive you. He continues that
"of the $9,utiO.u(Hi of property which is de
linquent $7.^0,137 Is composed of national
bank stock."
RpmcnibtT also that the nine millions
tie speaks of are the millions for whioh
he is responsible' to the city in the sum
of $122,98204, fur which demand has been
made upon him. Watch him close now,
for h"'* trying to fool you. He adds:
"Then la also delinquent, and forming a
part of the whole delinquency of $9,000,
--iOO, the sum of $1.200.<XK) for franchises as
sessed to the Oakland and Contra Costa
Water companies."
That's the way he explains the state
of affairs shown up yesterday In The
Call. The explanation is as near right
as is the assumption that he is holler,
l.arrlng the poll tax, than his predeces
sors.
1. I.ik at the figures furnished less than
a week ago by Dodge himself and see
how the?- fit his statements that he has
attempted to collect taxes on bank stocks
and franchises, and that these stocks and
franchises will total just the nine mil
lions, the taxes for which he If Bhy at
rhe city treasury. In his BUDtXlernent to

In another portion of his letter Dodg
flies in the face of the Auditor's figured
Ho says that, notwithstanding the- lac
that the average yearly delinquency tin
der Slebo was $6400 and his (Dodge's) de
linquenoy this year Is 5122.952 04. "1
â¢will be seen that the oustomary delin
quency has been reduced this year to i
minimum amount." He probably arrive*
at the minimum In the same manner ii
which ho arrived at the maximum in hii
dummy roll, which under the law he mus
go Into court and confess i 6 illegal o:
void â in other words, stuffed for electloi
purposesâ before he can be released fron
responsibility for collection of taxes un
der It. That he Is preparing to do thli
another paragraph of his letter shows, Hi
cays:
As the law compels the District Attorney
to yearly bring a suit against the Assessor
for all amounts remaining uncollected, I
presume that, following precedent, such a.
suit will be brought against me, In fact,
the District Attorney Informed me a month
ago that he would bo oompelled to follow
the plain reading of the law in this regard.
Why such a law should incumber our stat
ute books, which practically tends to pun
ish a man for his zeal in endeavoring to
list all property subject to taxation, should
he fall to collect thereon. I could
never understand. These suite have, how
ever been commenced yearly against my
predecessors In the pant, but on thÂ« show-
Ing of the Assessor that he had used dua
diligence In his efforts to collect this un
secured personal property taxes have com
to naught.
It can be seen readily from a compari
son of the figures in Dr. Podge's letter of
defense that he evades the Issue raised
by the figures $122, 04. Not once in 11
does ha mention them, nor in any of his
reports. With him It Is "claim every
thing 1 and concede nothing." It's "I did
this, never "I did not do that" It Is the
familiar trick of the politician. Dr. Dodge
is forever crying, "1 nave reduced the
taxes on real estate." Let him prove it
if ha can. He does not refer once to the
fact that under his admirable dummy
assessment the taxpayers of the city of
San Francisco have paid Into the State
over seven hundred thousand dollars more
than they did last year. The figures speak
for themselves.
Siebe's roll for IS9S was $352,344,061,
State's share of taxation $1,719,439.
Dodge's "dummy" assessment for 1599
$405,111,615. State's Bhare of taxes $2,471,208.
Increase in States share, Dodge over
Siebe, $751,709.
In other words, the taxpayers of San
Francisco will be called upon to pay the
State more than $700,000 tor one year of
Dodge with all his delinquency. ' Would
you say the luxury was expensive? Think
It over.

late>r"ho repeated the crime In the post
office at Bel en, N. Mex., but was arrest^-d
a few days after and was confined in the
Jail at Albuquerque, On June 24 Collier
escaped from Jail and disappeared.
The discovery was made afterward that
the fugitive was headed West and he was
traced to San Francisco. On September 4
Inspectors Munro and Erwin of this city
received a dispatch from the Sheriff of
Albuquerque requesting them to keep a
lookout for Collior, as it was believed
that he was in this city awaiting a letter
and a remittance from a friend In New
Mexico. The inspector found that on Sep
tember 51 Collier had sent a boy to the
general delivery window for a letter for
his alias, "Charles E. Hall." while he
hlmsÂ»-lf remained on the sidewalk.
Inspectors Munro and Erwin traced the
fugitive to Los Angeles and a watch was
kept for him In that city. Yesterday he
resorted to the familiar trick of Bending
a boy to the general delivery window f<>r
his mail and he was at once plaxed under
arrest by Postal Inspector Flint.
The fellow is known as a desperate char
ai'tt-r. but he mado no resistance and was
locked up in the Los Angek-p Jail, where
he will be kept until removed to Albu
querque for trial.

PRIMARY SCHOOL CHILDREN
AT THE MECHANICS' FAIR
TWO THOt'SAXr* pupils from the
Stanford, Btarr Kins 1 , Whlttler
and Winflold Scott primary
schools, with forty-five of their
teachers, were guests yesterday at the
Mechanics' Fair. They came in hun
dreds from all directions, many of
them hardly taking time to lunch bo
eag^r were they for a ramble in the
fairyland within the big Pavilion.
Long before 1 o'clock they were every
where, voicing their approbation of
the wonderful show by the various ex
hibitors.
The Filipinos and the "Injuns" came
Jn. of course, for the greater share of
the attention of the youngsters. Ap
preciating the fact that such would bo
the case, the management had put in
extra attractions at both buildings.
White Chief Patrick Whiskers Healy,
the honorary bookworm of the To-ki-a
Indians, was in charge of affairs at
the reservation of the Bffendocino
Aborigines, and he had arranged that
they should furnish something novel
as well as instructive. The three men
of the village were set to work mak
HAD TO STRIKE
FOR MEAT AND
FRESH BREAD
Nurses at French
Hospital Hungry.
â â¦ â
GIZZARD STEW FOR DINNER
â â¦
SUPERINTENDENT APPROVES OF
BURNED RICK
Â«
The nurses out at the French Hospital
â¢are hungry. On }londay they openly re
volted at dinner table and summoned
Superintendent Gardet to hear their just
grievances and inspect their meal of giz
zard stew and burned rice. The result of
this incipient strike was for from satis
factory, and the table of the famished at
tendants knew no meat course until yes
terday, when each nurse plate was graced
by a solitary thin chop.
None of the other departments at the
hospital find aught to complain of in their
allotted rations. The patients' table and
the internes' table are excellent, and as
for the table where Superintendent Gar
det stays his famishing spirits, that is
above reproach.
The nurses are at a loss to understand
why they alone should suffer. ' If It is an
economy proposition, they argue, It Is a
poor policy to expect good services from
hungry attendants. If it is â¢ a sanitary
1 proposition,- they- declare they find no
i trace of it In the entire scope of materla
me/dica. Besides their limited food supply,
the French Hospital nurses find other
things to carp at. They are allowed but
i one hour for recreation, and that hour
, must be spent within the narrow confines
of their Individual apartments. They
are not permitted to go on the lawn and
' must not sit upon the benches. Above all
' things merriment is considered a serious
offense, and a nurse who laughs is re
; ported to the august superintendent.
"The whole trouble is, said a sweet
! faced, white-capped nurse yesterday,
"that the hospital committee consists for
the most part of narrow-minded men.
I Most of them -are saloon-keepers and
| laundrymen, and know absolutely nothing
I about a hospital. They deem to consider
I nurses a class apart, who are supposed to
I work at a very low salary and guaranteed
! to eat no more than a sparrow. Now we
have healthy California apetites, but
they do not seem to bo able to realize the
j fact."
"It's this way," chimed in another
' nurse, merry and plump. (She has been
; only two months in the hospital.) "The
committee mistakes quantity for quality.
i Every day there is an immense dish of
stew put upon our table, soupmeat
' warmed over with cabbage. There is
plenty of It, but it is not the kind of food
a nurse needs. Then there is another dish
: they are very fond of giving us hereâ a
i sort of ragout of brains and calf's head
1 and pig's feet. It may be very good. None
of us girls have had the courage to taste
! It." â¢ ;
"There is no trouble in remembering
| our daily menu," said another of the
I twenty-eight underfed nurses. "It is the
! same every day. Soup l call it dish
waterâ soupmeat and cabbage stew and
I that horrible brain and head and plgsfeet
! mess. As for dessert, I have never known
( such a thing. Never a bit of fresh fruit,
I unless it is a few apples or peaches or
I pears bought for the patients but too
i green for their delicate palates."
About four months ago the nurses also
indulged in a strike, with one beneficial
result. The committee substituted fresh
bread for the stale crust that constituted
the regular breakfast ration. There was
also a demand made for more butter, but
without success. The allowance of butter
still remains the sameâ four tiny flat
squares for a table that provides for four
teen nurses.
Legallet and Gardet, according to the
ing Indian monoy. Chief Jeff Dick,
whose picture in oil, done by Grace
Hudson, adorns the art gallery, went
to work on the larger denominations,
while Chief Jim, who is also the medi
cine man of the Yo-Kl-as, and Cap
tain Johnny Pinto O'Doherty, who is a
sure enough Indian for all of the sur
name, took the job of getting out the
subsidiary coin.
During the entire afternoon. In spite
of the many counter attractions, the
coiners of Indian money held large
audiences spellbound. Jeff Dick's work
was done on a large flat stone, on
which he rubbed pieces of pinkish.
rock into cylindrical shapes. One of
these pieces, I>-fs than two inches long,
with a diameter of about three-quar
ters of an Inch, through which a hole
had been bored lengthwise by the use
nf a primitive drill, wan valued at $10,
coin of smaller denominations being
graded accordingly. By actual count
Jeff Dick made something like t*ft in
Yo-Kl-a money during the afternoon.
The less valuable coins were made
from clam shell, ground and polished
nurses, are the mc*t cordially detested of
all thf committeemen, and Berge*. Char
trey, Pabrlque and Reiss are declared by
the young women to have exerted theni
selvea In their favor and to be "very de
cent fellows."
Gardet. on the day the nurse* rose In
Indignation and summoned him to view
and taste the gizzard stew, approved of
thf dish and the burned rice accompani
ment, and declared that of all things he
had a decided taste for the rag-out of
! gizzard. As to Its staying and nourishing
I qualities he refused to commit himself.
There are twenty-eight nurses at the
French Hospital, all In the training school.
Mrs. Klnney Is In charge as head nurse
and Is generally admired as a nurse, a
trainer and a companion. The nurses
serve two yf-ars at the hospital. During
the first eight months they receive a sal
ary of $S a month. $12 for the second eight
months and $18 for the conclud
ing eight months. Of this schedule four >
montliÃ' salaries are deducted for special i
training and probationship, and according j
to the spirit of economy which rules the <
committee, these four months' deduction
come from the last term's payments.
A POPULAR EXCURSION.
A VISIT TO THE RUSSIAN RIVER
AND TJKIAH VALLEYS WITH
IN REACH OF ALL.
Every Passenger Guaranteed a Com
fortable Seat and Abundant
Time to Visit Favorite
Resorts.
The most delightful time of the year
to visit the country surrounding San
Francisco is during the month of Sep
tember. For few years in the past has
the country been, more delightful than
the present month. The California
Northwestern Railway, recognizing
this, is offering for the benefit of the j
public an excursion to Uklah on Sun
day, September 24. Special trains will
carry the passengers through Marln,
Santa Rosa, Russian River and Uklah
valleys.
The comparatively cool summer
which -we have had has delayed the
ripening of the grapes, so that thou
sands of acres of vines laden with
grapes can be seen from the car win
dows. The Russian River, always pic
turesque, will be skirted for nearly five
miles.
Every ticket sold will guarantee a
seat. The best cars the company has,
including the new ones lately pur
chased, will be used on this occasion.
The time of departure from Tiburon
ferry, San Francisco, will be 8:30 a. m.,
Sunday, September 24. The special
train will run through from Tiburon
without stops, and also on the return
leave TTkiah at 6 p. m. This will give
the passengers nearly five hours in
Ukiah to visit Vichy Springs, ranch
erms, asylum, fish hatchery of the Cali
fornia Northwestern Railway, and nu
merous other points of interest. The
fare for the round trip will be only
$2; children $1.

Over at the Filipino village the
school children watched the latest ad

they have been accustomed to do in a

The water buffalo and the Filipino
chickens were sources of childish won
der. Upstairs the circus was crowded
and the youngsters were more than de
lighted.
All the afternoon the side shows
were crowded and everything in the
â way of frt'e samples, from coffee on
the half-shell to electric shocks, wa.s
partaken of by the primary young
sters. They filled up on popcorn and
Icecream, they listened to the band
and they went into ecstacies on the

time. No happier crowd has ever been

and none for which the displays had
such powers of attraction.
MUTINEERS IN
IRONS ON THE
JABEZ HOWES
The Mate Assaulted
by Four Sailors.
IT WAS A TROUBLOUS VOYAGE
THE LIGHTSHIP IS BADLY
NEEDED ON THE BAR.
The American ship Jabez Howes arrived
in port from Baltimore yesterday with
four of the crew in irons and the police
flag flying in the main rigging. The offi
cers and jntn have been at outs ever since
the ship left the East, and in consequence
there are charges and counter-charges.
The men say that as soon as they are
paid off they will have Captain Clapp and
Mate Rodgers arrested for "beating and
wounding on the high seas." The mate
retorts by saying that the men are a lot
of "green" hands and know more about
"back" talk than they do about reefing.
Several times they nearly mutinied and
last Tuesday they would have done so
had he not placed the ringleaders in irons,
The Jabez Howes made a good run here
from Baltimore and Captain Clapp was
very much pleased in consequence. The
vessel lias been sold to W. K. Mighell and
others of this city, and as booh as her
cargo of coal is discharged she will go
Into the coasting trade. On Tuesday last
the Jabez Howes was off the lightship,
but owing to the thick fog the captain
decided to stand off shore again. At 4
p m. the ship was off the North Faral
fones and then the trouble began. Male
Kodgera gave an order and Kmil Dorst,
one of the crew, refused to obey it. The
order was repeated and Durst made a
rush at the mate. A mix-up ensued and
Sam I'eeples, James Kelly and Hern Litz
went to Dorst's assistance. For a few
moments it looked as though there was
going to be a mutiny, but Captain Clapp
and the other officers, armed with pistols,
soon quelled the disturbance, and Dorst,
Peeples, Kelly and LJtz were placed in
As soon as the vessel came to an anchor
Sergeant Sieve Bunner and Officer W.
Ferguson of the Harbor police went
aboard and brought tho sailors ashore,
To-day they will be handed over to the
United States Marsha.l and will be charged
with mutiny.
There is great indignation among ship
ping men over the fact that the lightship
has been brought into port for repairs.
Captain Clapp of the Jabez Howes says
that had she been on her station he could
have made port yesterday. After making
the liÃlitship ho stood out to sea on ac
count of the fog, and while he was off the
North Farallones the lightship slipped
her cable and came into port. Next day
Captain Clapp started to sail in and tried
to pick up the lightship again and failed.
Naturally he thought he had miscalcu
lated atid tried all day to make out his
position. Yesterday he learned the facts
of the case and came in.
September and October are the two
worst months in the yeur for fog and
shipping men say it is a shame to bring
the lightship in for three weeks at this
time. Captains of coasters can neither
pick up Point Reyes nor the Farallones
nine times out of ten during this kind of
weather, and in consequence when they
have run up their distance they keep a
bright lookout for the lightship, and when
they find her set their course for San
Francisco with all confidence. Now they
have no lightship to guide them, the sub
stitute being a can buoy on which is
painted "Lightship mooring." It was
suggested yesterday that during the prev
alence of the fog and while the lightship
is being repaired the tender Madrone be
anchored out there to guide ships into

into the realms of matrimony.
Both the bride and groom are well
known in San Francisco, and their friends
have been awaiting this matrimonial ad
venture for some time. In order to avoid
the raillery of their friends the young
