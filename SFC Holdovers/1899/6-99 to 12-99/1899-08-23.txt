MERCIER IN A TRAP
Forced Into a Con
fession That May
Land Him in a
Prison Cell.
T~> EXNES, Aug. 22.â T0-day was
â¢ RENNES, Labori's day at the was
Maltre Labori's day at the Ly-
Ueee. where Captain Dreyfus Is
standing trial on a charge of
treason. Labor! was the central
figure of the scene. As the Dreyfus
drama unrolled before a crowded court
this afternoon his tall. Viking-like
form, draped in a long black gown, bor
dered with ermine, sitting in front of
the footlights, was the magnet which,
from the moment the curtain was run
up until it fell at noon, drew all re
gards, not merely glances of curiosity,
but the steady gaze of admiration. His
merp presence brought brightness into
thf courtroom and fresh light into the
proceedings.
Labor! did what people had ex
pected. He galvanized the dormant
defense into an active, living thing. M.
Demange is conciliatory. He has air
ways seemed to fear to tread on the
military corn. Labori i.= a gladiator
and always speaks to touch his foe to
the quick. Let there be the slightest ,
opening in his opponent's defense and
he thrusts home. To-day when â¢ M. De
mange found nothing to ask a witness
M. Labori's quick eye discovered weak
spots and he came forward with search- '
ing questions. He opened to-day with ;
aji â¢â¢â liui.uuiu speech and tie. .audience |
could have listened for an hour to his i
rich, melodious voice, modulated tones
and then impassioned outbursts, ac
companied by energetic and speaking
gestures.
Generals Roiret. Billot, Mercier and :
Boisdeffre, with the other military wit
nesses, gave one another anxious
glances and put their heads together to
exchange obviously disagreeable im
pressions as Labori plied the smaller
military fry who occupied the witness
stand successively to-day with discon
certing questions.
Labori cornered Mercier on the
Schneider letter, which the latter had
used in evidence and which Colonel
Schneider had repudiated as a forgery.
The general was surprised when Labori
suddenly demanded that M. Mercier be
recalled. ' Evidently he hoped the tri
bunal would support him In refusing
to explain how he got a copy of a let
ter which was of later date than his
incumbency as Minister of War.
But Labori was not to be denied. He
insisted that Mercier should give some
explanation. Then, after hesitating,
Mercier declared that he would assume
all the responsibility attaching to his
possession of the document. This, as
Labori Intended it should be, was a
demonstration of communication by
the general staff of part, at least, of
the' secret dossier to an ordinary sol
dier, such as Mercier became imme
diately on leaving the Ministry of War.
When Labor! had attained his object
end forced a confession of grave viola
tion of law on the part of General Mer
cier he gave a smile of grim satisfac
tion and then added significantly:
"I shall have other questions to put
to General Mercier."
The scene was highly dramatic and
made a profound impression upon all
the spectators. General Mercier must
now be spending a very miserable even
ing, for as the result of this admission,
and with the additional charge of com
municating secret documents to the
court-martial of 1594, he is liable to ar
rest at any moment. Indeed some peo
pie think it hot impossible that he will
be lying in the military prison adjoin
ing the cell of Captain Dreyfus before
the week is out.
Another series of questions put by M.
Labor) concerned Lajoux, a spy for
merly in the service of the French War
Office, but packed off to South Amer
ica, according to various military wit
nesses, because he proved a swindler.
Labori asked how it was if that were
bo that Lajoux was still receiving
monthly payments. Commandant Rol
!in. completely taken aback, replied
that a cessation of payments was under
consideration. The impression con
voyed by Labori's questions and the re
plies given was that Lajoux was being
paid by the War Office to keep out of
the way in the interest of Ksterhazy,
whom Lajoux, in a letter read in court
offering revelations In the Dreyfus af
fair, Indicated as the real traitor. M.
Labori's cross-examination in this mat
ter, therefore, was a distinct advantage
to the accused. Labori announced that
he intended to recall several witnesses.
Mercier, Boget and others will be put
to the test of a severe cross-examina
tion. To his friends Mr. Labori has ex
pressed himself confident of being able
to tear to pieces the evidence these gen
eral: Wavy given so confidently before
a sympathetic tribunal.
Captain Dreyfus to-day pursued the
attitude he took yesterday and replied
to the statements of hostile witnesses
with arguments and the presentation of
counteracts, only once giving way to
his feelings and offering a cry of pro
The San Francisco Call.

test. This was at the conclusion of |
Colonel Bertin's deposition, when, with
broken voice, the accused declared his
love of France and the army.
"Yes," he cried, "I love France and I ;
love my country, but it is with senti- I
ments different from those animating
they who come hen ta-day^ t" testify
against me."
M. Labori, if anything, was better
after his exertions than before them. '
The excitement under which he labored j
seemed to act as a stimulant, although |
many friends noticing his flushed face,
feared there might be a relapse. So far
from this being the case, however, he
was able to go for a drive with his
wife In an auto-car this afternoon and
on his return he held quite a recep
tion, afterward spending the time until
dinner in goinr over to-day's evidence
and preparing for to-morrow.
The scurrilous tactics of the anti-
Dreyfusard newspapers may be illus
trated by a paragraph appearing in
their organ here this evening, declaring
that the attack on Labori, which, it In
sinuates did very little harm, was made
solely to arouse the pity of the people
of Rennes for the lamentable lot of an :
escaped convict from Devil's Island.
COURT SPECTATORS
WARMLY GREET LABORI
Wounded Counsel Confuses Several
of the Witnesses Against the
Prisoner.
RENNES, Auc. 22.â Maitre T.abori,
leading counsel for the defense, who was
murderously assaulted August 14, was
present in court t liis morning at the be
ginning of the Becond day 'if the third
week of t lio Becond trial by court-martial
of Captain Alfred Dreyfus, of the artii
!' ry, charged with treason.
The arrival ol M. Laborl at the T.yee ,
was the signal fur Bce'nes of extraordin
ary enthusiasm. At 6:15 a. m. threÂ» car
riages, preceded by a number of bicycles, j
drove up. Th>- Rrsi carriage contained
M. Labor! /and his wife and physicians, j
The others contained friends of the law- |
yer and some police Inspectors, The
crowd about the Lycee building rushed up!
to M. Labofi's carriage and a numb, r of
others eagerly thrust their hands through
the windows to greet the distlngulsHed
lawyer. When M. Laborl descended he
was surrounded by friends and a him
dred hands pressed his, while he was as
sail<o wilh all sort of questions, to which
he smilingly replied:
"I am going on well, my friends, thank
you. thank you."
As ML Laborl, still accompanied by |
Ume. I.abori and a physician, entered â 
the courtroom, the audience greeted him
by standing up, and there was a general
roar of applause, accompanied by the
clapping of bands. Tears sprains '" the
ryes of the wounded man. who was evi
dently deeply affected by the warm wel
come accorded him. Among those who
greeted M. Labor! were Generals Billol
ami Merder, v.)io courteously inquired as
tii his condition. The lawyer looked very
well, considering his recent i sperlence.
He walked quite briskly, but held his left
arm close to his side, in order not t'> dis
turb the wound. Counsel was conducted
to a light. Well-cushioned armchair In
stead of the ordinary ranebottotn behind
the table set apart for thr lawyers.
Mme. Laborl. who entered the court
room ahead of her husband, also received
a hearty greeting- As she took a seat in
court she was surrounded by friends, who
overwhelmed her with congratulations On
her husband's recovery, to which she
smilingly responded. At titst the audi
ence seemed to be apprehensive that Col
onel Jouaust, president of the court.
might treat the applause of Mr. I,aborl
â¢â s a demonstration which would warrant
him in clearing the court. It began.
therefore, with a f<w timid claps of the
hind but was soon followed by gener.il
aoDla'use on the part of the whole audi
ence with the exception of a few standing
â¢it the back, of the courtroom.
As M Laborl shook hands with Gen
eriis Hillot and Mercier. who smilingly
.ongratulated him on being able to iv
aDDear In the case, the lawyer thanked
them for calling at his residence whllo
he was in bed.
DreyfuÃ entered the courtroom soon
after and, after having saluted the
judges turned to M. Labori with out
stretched hand, a smile of ke^n pleasure
lighting up his pale and. usually imp|s

, Blve features. The lawyer took the pris
oner's hand and shook it warmly, where
upon Dreyfus gave htm another look of
gratitude and took his seat in front of
counsel's table, with his back toward
them.
Colonel Jouaust next read an address to
M. Labori. the tone being quite sympa
thetic. The lawyer made an impassioned
reply. Mo was deeply affected ami his
whs â â¢Iciic. (hough -not so "strong" as
before he was shot. He was very nervous
and excited and swayed to and fro aS he
delivered his reply. His hearers were
profoundly impressed.
M. Labori's reply to the president con
siderably fatigued him. and he sat down
Hushed and holding his side. He after
ward once or twice nervously twitched
his fingers and an expression flitted over
his face as though he was suffering:.
Mine. Rejane, the celebrated actress,
was among those present in court to-day.
She made the trip to Rennes especially
to see the trial and return of M. Labon
into the case, and she was one of those
: who applauded the most heartily his en
try into the courtroom.
The'lirst witness to-day was M. Grenier,
the former Prefect of Belfort. His testi
mony was favorable to Dreyfus and dis
tinctly hostile to Esterhazy. :
Major Rollin of the intelligence depart
ment was asked by M. Labor! during the
course of the former's testimony how a
certain document of a later date than
Mercler's Ministry came into General
Mercler's possession. Rollin said It wa.s
not his business to explain, but counsel
insisted, asking whose business it was.
Finally M. Labor! asked Colonel Jouaust
to request Genera] Mercier to explain.
The general arose and said he declined to.
answer. M. Labor) Insisted, but Mercier
till refused to answer and Major Car
riere, the Government commissary, sup
ported him. on the ground that the ex
amination was entering upon a matter
Which ought not. in the interest of the
country, to be discussed publicly.
M. Labor! then declared in a loud voice
that he would reserve to himself the right
to -take the necessary measures to obtain
the desired information.
The next point was made by Dreyfus in
his reply to Major Rollin. The latter had
remarked' that all the prisoner's papers
were seized when his rooms were searched
in 1894, and Colonel Jouaust said that cer
tain papers from his textlvook. "The
School of War," were found missing. To
this the prisoner retorted, "Not in 1K94,
my colonel." This caused some sensation,
as the obvious interpretation was that the
pages were torn out at the War Office
arid then the fact was used against him
as an insinuation that he had communi
cated the missing pages to foreign agents.
M. Ferret, a former Secretary of the
War Office, next testified to having seen
Dreyfus prying into other officers' work
during their absence, and the prisoner re
plied excitedly that Ferret's statements
were concoctions by a former Minister of
War. which caused a sensation. Then in
a cooler manner the prisoner made a
statement explaining the difficulties in
the way of a civilian, such as Ferret, en
tering the offices of the general staff.
General Gonse thereupon presented two
letters to the effect that the writers, both
of whom were civilians, obtained easy ad
mittance to the offices.
Dreyfus retorted that the regulations
were very strict in this respect and that
'therefore some persons were utility of
gross breach of discipline, and M. De
mfingo scored by adding that if entry in
these offices was easy, why anybody could
procure the information Dreyfus was al
leged to have obtained so surreptitiously.
The next witness. Lieutenant Colonel
Kf-rtin. who was the head of Dreyfus' of
fice in 1894; showed himself to be a most
virulent enemy of the prisoner. Ho had
evidently learned his testimony by heart
and declaimed it in a strident, aggressive
tone, Which grated upon the ears of the
audience. Some of his remarks, particu
larly his declarations that he was con
vinced of Dreyfus' guilt by M. Bertillon's
chart and his introduction of Ksterhazy'3
statements against Dreyfus, elicited gen
eral smiles.
Following are the proceedings in detail:
The president of the court. Colonel
Jouaust. on taking his seat, turjied. to M.
Labor! and amid Impressive silence read
an address as follows:
Allow me, M. T,abnri, to express to you the
unanimous sentiment nt the court-martial at
the odious sentiment to which you nearly fell
a victim. This unspeakable act has excited
everywhere, and especially arvumc the mem
ber* of the court-martial, the keenest imlicna
tlon. (Applause.) We are Kind It dirt not have
frrave consequence to yon, onrt that the skillful
nivl devoted attention upon you permit you to
resume your duties to-day.. (Applause.)
In spite of the President's exhortation
not to fatigue him, M. Labor! replied:
In spite of the president's exhortation
not to fatigue himself M. Labor! replied:

my weakness and emotion, to say a word In
reply to those you have done me the honor to

It was for me a visitation of a particularly
painful nature to be struck down at the time
when this case was beginning to realize my
beautiful dream of the last few years, namely
to plead this case In all Its amplitude before a
tribunal of soldiers. That was my aspiration,
and that will explain to you my emotion and
sorrow, as well an my Joy to-day. I will not
revert to that, but I wish to thank all -friends

PARIS, Aug. 22.â Colonel Schneider,
the Austrian military attache,
arrived in Paris yesterday. He
writes to the Figaro confirming
his repudiation of the document
produced at Rennes, adding:
"On November 30, 1597, my opinion
was absolutely contrary to that ex
pressed in the document in question.
The addition of that date and my sig
nature to the text attributed to me
constitute a forgery, even if â what I
cannot say without it â the text ema
nated from me at different dates."
The change in the attitude of Captain
Dreyfus is attributed to the advice of
Maitre Mornard, now associated with
Maitres Labor! and Pemange in the
conduct of the defense, who told him
he must speak in his own behalf, as his
sullen silence would send him back to
Devils Island. â  Dreyfus now fights for
himself as energetically as does his
counsel.
The confusion into which the ranks
of the military witnesses are thrown by
anything approaching {a lively .cross
examination is due to the fact that
their cases are all prepared for them,
and,- in* some instances"^ av^h^wf it ton
out by M. Ployer. who pulls the string
for Paris in the interests of the mili
tary party. Hence the dismay spread
by the reappearance of M. Laborl..._ ._.
The spy, Lajoux. so prominent in to
day's evidence, was one of the least
reputable connected with the intelli
gence bureau. He was paid to leave
France and is still paid 200 francs a
month. He knows all about Caere, who
betrayed Germany's secrets to France,
and, among others, that a decorated
colonel of the â  general staff supplied
Germany with Important .mobilization
plans and other secrets. This was two
years after Dreyfus was condemned,
and the traitorous colonel was Henry.
When Picquart was investigating this
affair Henry got himself sent to Basle
to take the statements of Cuers and to
browbeat them into suppressing the
truth. Hush money is still being paid.
On one occasion Lajoux was thrust into
a lunatic asylum to prevent awkward
disclosures.
HAMBURG. Aug. 22. â The Ham
burgische Correspondent, discussing
the assertion that Germany should
publish certain documents proving the
innocence of Dreyfus, says: "The an
swer to this is that documents of this
nature cannot be produced, for the sim
ple reason that Germany never had
anything to do with Captain Dreyfus.'

I,*t us now continue the proceedings, in
which we have yet to pass through many
vicissitudes. Thanks to th" fullheFS of these
investigations, we shall see emerged from
them perfect truth and complete Justice mak
ing for peace.
In conclusion M. Labofi said that they
now had the right to hope and declared
that protests and recriminations after the
success of the work of the justice must
be regarded inadmissible and that It must
be known that "error has ever a larger
share in human affairs than treachery."
(Applause.) As the eminent lawyer, whoso
face showed fatigue and emotion, seated
himself there was prolonged handclap
ping.
M. Qrenler, former Prefect of Belfort,
was the first witness called. He Bald he
considered Esterhazy to be an Irrespon
sible personage. Esterhazy. he continued,
was the orderly of witness' father, who
always praised his fidelity and devotion,
bin "Esterhazy even then was a disap
pointed man.- He was always complain
ing of deception, grumbling at fate and
living in great style without means to up
hold it. He squandered successive lega
cies. The witness said he Introduced
Esterhazy to M. Jules Roche, reporter of
the Budget of the Minister of War, who
wanted an educated. intelligenj. officer,
capable of explaining military technicali
ties. ' No one, according to M. Qrenier,
was better qualilted for this than Ester
hazy. who spoke every European lan
guage and Was thoroughly posted on mil
itary science and the general and military
hist't ry of Europe. At Estt- rhazy's 'â â  -
que?t witness made numerous attempts to
get him into the Ministry of War, which
Esterhazy declared was necessary in or
der to enable him to pass for lieutenant
colonel.
M. Grenier continued that at the time
Esterhazy attributed the resistance
which he encountered to various people,
including the late Lieutenant Colonel
Henry, but when the witness .reassured
Esterhazy on this point he exclaimed:
"It. is the last thing 1 should expect for
Henry to be nasty." . . â¢

PROGRAMME FOR THE RECEPTION.
T~^ AR out to sea California gaces for the first sight of the transport bearing her zi'arlike sons
JL* from the Philippines. Enthroned on the hills of San Francisco she watches over the waters,
counting the minutes hours, the hours days that separate her from the embraces of her boys.
Her vigil is near to an end.
At noon to-morrozv, if all goes well â and there is no reason to expect otherwise â the Sher
man will be off the Faralloncs, the news will be rushed to the city, and from the dome of The Call
building a vast kite carrying the stars and stripes will shoot up into air, announcing the a)ixiously
awaited hour. A few hours afterward the transport will steam through the Golden Gate into the
landlocked harbor of San Francisco, with the guns on the battleship lowa and of Alcatraz island
booming in salute.
The reception that has been in preparation for weeks will begin, officially, with the naval
parade of the tugs and yachts of the ba\, under command of Commodore John D. Spreckcls. After
the signal announcing the arrival of the Sherman, the citizens of San Francisco will have a full
hour's time to board the boats on which their tickets call for passage. The tugs Fearless, Re
liance, Alert, Union and Millcn Griffith will start from Howard No. i. The Monarch, Sea King,
Sea Queen and Sea Witch will start from I 'alle jo-street wharf. An hour later the parade will be
formed.
It has been arranged that a letter will be handed by the boarding pilot to Captain J. C. Reid,
quartermaster in charge of the transport Sherman, requesting him not to enter the harbor before
j : 10 p. m., so that she may be met off Fort Point by the parading fleet of handsomely decorated
tugs and yachts in tow, which will steam tozcard her in two columns, circle around her stern and
come up the harbor abreast of her, one column on each side. Outside of these columns, to the north
east and rear, all other steam and sail vessels will take up their position. In this order the trans
port and escorting vessels will move to the bay off F olsom-street dock, where she will cast anchor.
After that an informal pandemonium of welcome will undoubtedly break out and continue,
even after the night illumination of the bay is inaugurated. No such spectacle has ever before been
attempted here.
Next morning â Friday â the boys. will disembark and breakfast at the ferry depot with
their parents and relatives, and at io:;o o'clock will march to the Presidio under an escort of the
Third Artillery, the Colorado Volunteers and the National Guard. The line of march zcill be up
Market to Van Ness azrnuc to the Presidio. After making camp at the Presidio the California
boys will be granted furloughs until io o'clock the following morning. In the evening the grand
electrical illumination will be displayed for the first time.
On Saturday morning military concerts will be given at it o'clock at Union square and
Columbia square. In the evening wiU be the great night parade, pyrotcchuical and electrical dis
play, followed by a banquet to the Calif ornians at the ferry depot.
The night parade will form on Van Ness avenue and streets leading into it, and will
march to Market street to the ferry, where the Californians will march to the banquet, the column
continuing on Market to Montgomery, to California, up California to Kcarny, Kcarny to Market,
out Market to Van Ness azrnuc.
Even this will not end the reception. At dates yet to be fixed the Fighting First will be
banqueted at the ferry depot by the Native Daughters, and, still later, will be decorated with
medals.
The transportation companies hazr announced their intention of running late trains and
boats on the night of the big parade to accommodate residents of Marin, Sonoma, Alamcda and
Santa Clara counties.
VOLUNTEER RECEPTION PARADE OFFICIALS.
CAPTAIN A. J. DUNUBAVY of the .
harbor police believes that it will
take the entire police force of San
Francisco to handle the crowd
that will congregate on East
street, between the Folsom-street wharf
an d the ferry depot on the morning tho
troops leave the transport. Acting with
the Parents" and Relatives' Association,
he appeared before the citizens' executive
committee yesterday and presented a
plan that would possibly discourage many
people from congregating on the water
front at the time of debarkation. The
proposition was to take the troops from
the Government wharf on a ferry-boat
and land them at the breakfast tables at
the depot, thus obviating the march
along East street.
The committee agreed with the plan, but
Captain Batchelder, representing the
officer in charge of the wharf, knocked
out the whole idea by announcing that
it was not feasible and would not be per
mitted. In passing, the captain informed
the committee as to who would -be al-^
lowed on the wharf. His list included
two representatives from each, of the San
Francisco- morning and evening papers,
the Governor and staff. Mayor Phelan
and members of the citizens' executive
committee, twenty-four members of the
executive committee of the Parents' and
Relatives' Association and a limited com
mittee representing the State Legislature.
At the request of the Red Cross Society
Mayor Phelan has sent' the following tel
egram to Governor Lee. Pierre, S. D. :

The acting Secretary of the Navy has
sent orders to the commanding officer of
the lowa to fire the national salute of
twenty-one guns when the transport
Sherman enters the port. Orders hava
also been received instructing the tars and

CROWDS CHEERED

A test was made last night of the elec

was turned oii about 8 o'clock and
the thousands of incandescent lamps that i
go to form the display sparkled for about
a minutes. When the street sud- j
denly burst into a Maze of glory, the
heavens apparently changing into a can-!
opy of fin . the crowds on the sidewalks
went wild anil cheer after cheer rent the i
air. The people rushed to the center of

THANKS EXTENDED

The decoration committee is deeply
grateful to the members of the Colorado
Regiment for their valuable aid in plac

its sincere thanks. The boys generously
offered tnelr services to the committee

j eyes of the delighted observer.
"Too much praise cannot be accorded to
the Colorado boys," said Chairman \Y. J.

GUERIN'S LARDER IS
ALMOST DEPLETED
Soon the Besieged Party Will Have
to Subsist on Potatoes
Alone.
PARIS, Aug. 22.â "At Guerin's strongholdâ Half a dozen boxes of
tinned food and fifty kilograms of potatoes," is the curt report on the
commissariat by the cook, who left the building last night, probably
because nothing is left to cook. The environs of the fortress show lit
tle change, except that the police and Republican Guards have been re
placed by soldiers of the line, the One Hundred and Thirty-fourth and
Seventy-fourth, Esterhazy's regiment, taking duty by turns. The pro
gramme is each night the same.
Up to midnight the police have some difficulty :n controlling the
mob that surges round the streets leading to the Grand Occident de
France. Every half-hour or so there is a change of police. Half a dozen
prisoners are taken and conducted with more energy than gentleness
by the Police Bureau near Rue de Chabrol. Bit by bit. however, the
crowd begins to disperse, and by midnight the street is deserted.
THE ENEMIES
OF DREYFUS
Continued from First Pase.
bad spy," whom it was found necessary
to suppress.
M. Labor! asked the witness where he
knew Lajouz had offered to make revela
tions in the Dreyfus affair, and the wit
ness replied that Lajouz wrote tv the
Minister of War asking for assistance
and referring to the Dreyfus rase.
The clerk of the court read a letter
in which, after dwelling upon his services,
Lajoux said it was in consequence of
Henry's exactions that the spy filers baa
become an enemy instead of an ally. He
also described a conversation with Cuers,
in which Cuers declared _ reyf us had
never been heard of at army headquarters
in Berlin, and that on the news of the
arrest of Dreyfus, General Count yon
Waldersee summoned all the German
military attaches in Europe to Berlin,
and then declared that not one of them
had ever had relations with Dreyfus.
Cuers said that he himself had never
heard of Dreyfus. Lajoux then com
plain, d of his abandonment by the head
quarters staff and the measures taken
against him by officers of the Ministry of
War. He spoke of the promises of
Colonel Sandherr and Henry, who gave
him credit for the most of the success of
their work in the Intelligence Depart
ment. , ,
After the reading of this letter M. La
bor! inquired: "Can Lieutenant Colonel
Rollln tell how a man, regarded as a
rogue and a bad egg, is now receiving a
pension of 200 francs monthly".'"
Witness replied: "It is no doubt in
recognition of his previous services.
( Laughter).
Then M. Labor! asked if the witness as
sumed responsibility for the report of
November 30, 18H7. which was attributed
to a former military attache.
The Government rummissary. Major
Carriere, protested against this question,
saying it referred to affairs of state and
should not be answered except behind
closed doors.
M Labori pointed out that he had not
named anybody, and Lieutenant Colonel
Kollin replied that he had no knowledge
regar ling the transaction of the docu
ment in question.
M Labori called the attention of the
witness to the cautious nature of his re
ply, and asked him how the document
came into the possession of General
Mercier. General Mercier thought the
witness was not Justified in answering.
But 'n reply to further questions. Mercier
declared he took full responsibility lor
the translations submitted to the court.
Thereupon M. Labori pointed out that
when the document was produced. Gene
ral Mercier was no longer Minister ot
War, and asked what right he had to
have in his possession a document whicn
was a state secret. Mercier did not re
ply. Counsel tnen asked what right had
General Mercier to retain possession of
all documents in the secret dossier. Gene
ral Mercier was silent.
M. Laboriâ l am asking for the official
responsibility and I make note of thÂ»i fact
that it is retuaed. 1 will reserve th-: nght
to take all the measures which 1 think
proper. (Sensation.)
Counsel added that he would later ask
Colonel Jouaust to recall General Mercier
and put numerous questions to him. 10
which, however, counsel added, he could
foresee Mercier would refute to reply.
(Prolonged sensation.)
Ferret a former secretary of the Minis
ter of War, who is alleged to have caught
Dreyfus prying into the work of some of
his fellow officers during their absence,
testified that toward the end of J893, on
returning from his lunch, at an hour the
officers were usually out, he found Drc-y
--fus in the Fourth Bureau, standing will; a
stranger, a civilian, at the table, consult
ing a document which seemed to the wit
ness to be connected with the transport
of troops.
M. Demangeâ Why did you not give this
evidence in 1594?
Witness said he regretted he had over
looked it. Besides, he added, it was not
his business to suspect his chiefs.
M. Demangeâ The court will form its
own opinions of this five years' silence.
M. Labori asked when the witness first
mentioned these facts.
Ferretâ l do not remember. (Murmurs.')
M. Laboriâ Try. It. would be interesting
to have an explanation.
Ferretâ lt was about a year ago.
The prisoner protested against such
statements which he said were nothing I
but "vile insinuations," collected by a
former Minister of War. (Great .sensa
tion.)
"I never went into my office," continued
Dreyfus, "at any other time than thf>
hours of duty. I declare it was impos
sible, or at least most difficult for a civil
ian to enter the office of the Ministry of
War."
At this juncture the clerk of the court
read a letter from M. Scheurer-Kestner,
excusing himself for being unable to at
tend the session of the court. The let
ter referred to the steps of Mathleu Drey
fus to secure the rehabilitation of his
brother, and described the writer's inves- \
tigations and how It was only when Es- j
terhazy's handwritfng was shown him !
that his hesitation ended. The letter also
described the moments of anguish the !
writer experienced during the course of j
the campaign and dwelt on the opinion ,
expressed in (he judgment of the Court of I
Cassation and the confessions of Ester- j
hazy that he was the writer of tho bor- I
dereau. In conclusion the letter said: :
"You will permit an old Alsatian, Mon
sleur Le President, to express the senti- !
ment that the hour of justice will soon j
strike in the Interest of the army and the i
country." (Great sensation.)
Replying to M. Demange, Bertin fur- I
ther explained his connection with
Scheurer-Kestner. At the maneuvers
that year witness .told General Billot of
the action M. Scheurer-Kestner was
talcing and the general replied: "Tell him !
not to do anything. I shall appeal to my j
old friend."
"I telegraphed to M. Scheurer-Kestner
accordingly," said Bertin, "for I could not
enter Alsace, the Germans having brti
tally forbidden me to go there."
M. Demange reminded the witness of a
remark he made to M. Ferdinand
Bcheurer-Kestner, namely: "There are
only tive of us' who know this terrible se
cret. One out of five must betray it be
fore you can know anything." Counsel
asked" if the secret was not that Dreyfus
was innocent.
M. Bertinâ Oh, no.
M. Demangeâ According to the terms of
the conversation?
Lieutenant Colonel Bertin, energetically
âNo, no, and I'll tell you- why. I never
concealed two things from the members
of the Scheurer-Kestner family. Firstly,
that M. Scheurer-Kestner would be doing
a great service if his efforts resulted in
establishing the innocence of a man who
has worn the uniform of a French officer.
Secondly, that I was convinced of the
guilt of Dreyfus. (Sensation.)
M. Demangeâ Did you not once make
the following remark: "This Jew was
thrust at headquarters and we had to get
rid of him?"
Lieutenant Colonel Bertinâ No, never; I
absolutely deny it. When I was in the
War Office the Jewish question was never
raised. Dreyfus was regarded as a com
rade. I confided all my secrets to him ana
gave him the password of my locker. A i
number of my official reports were here,
read, unanimously recognizing' Dreyfus as
a brilliant officer who was anxious to suc
ceed. The reports of the headquarters'
staff alone cast imputations upon the ,
prisoner's character.
M. Labor] asked the court's leave, with
the permission of Lieutenant Colonel Ber
tin. to question the witness on a delicate
subject. He referred, continued counsel,
to a remark made by Bertin at a dinner
at which M. Labor! was present at the
house of a mutual friend a fortnight after
the degradation of Dreyfus.
"I have absolute confidence in the good ;
faith of Lieutenant Colonel Bertin,"
added M. Laborl, "and 1 am convinced
that if his recollections are exact enough I
he will not hesitate to reply."
Bertin asked the lawyer to mention the
name of the mutual friend who gave the j
dinner. Labori whispered the name and
the witness nodded assent.
M. Laboriâ Do you remember that you
were among the first to suggest to me
belief in the innocence of Dreyfus?
Bertinâ No, no; it is impossible.
Laboriâ Does the witness remember that i
i during the course of the dinner he be- I
came excited in talking about Dreyfus?
The lieutenant colonel pointed out that j
the terms of intimacy which prevailed
at the dinner must be taken into account,
reminded M. Labori that he was an old
friend of his father and wondered whether
counsel was still the same man who,
taking the witness' hands* on the occasion
of the dinner, said, "I will never forget
what you have done for my father."
"I do not forget the words," said M.
Labori, his voice trembling at the recol
lections; "but I am referring specially to
the somewhat strong remarks you made
against Maitre Demange. I am not seek- I
ing to provoke a scene between Lieuten- i
ant Colonel Bertin and M. Demange. Did j
you not say to me when I spoke of Maitre
Demange's belief in the innocence of
Dreyfus: 'Demange, don't mention him.
He is counsel for the German embassy'?"
(Cries of "(>h. oh."j
"If I can remember I will reply. I am
here to tell the truth, and 1 will tell all |
I know. I am here for the truth, like i
you."
M. Laboriâ When I asked why you said I
that, you replied that M. Demange had
already defended other spies and that
he was an official defender.
Lieutenant Colonel Bertin admitted the j
truth of M. Laboris statements.
M. Laboriâ You should be sure regard-
Ing the intervention of Maitre Demange,
because a barrister of his standing is not
appointed officially unless there are im
portant reasons for it.
Counsel proceeded to relate how when
he left Lieutenant Colonel Bertin he dis
cussed the foregoing conversation with
his wife and wondered what security
could be found in the oath or judgment i
of men who believed things so ridiculous, i
"My belief in the innocence of Dreyfus," '
M. Labori added, "began that day. I give j
you my word of honor that Lieutenant
Colonel Bertin admitted he had a grudge
against M. Demange, saying it was be
cause he defended Dreyfus badly by per
sisting in making Dreyfus deny all the I
charges against him. Lieutenant Colonel ;
Bertin evidently thought Maitre Demange j
I ought to have joined with the others in
trying to convict Dreyfus."
Major Gondron was called to testify re
garding the Austrian woman, Mme. Deb/.
He said he had taken tea at her home on
a single occasion, and that he thereafter
confined himself to exchanging a few po
lite words with her when they m?t,
though the gallant officer asserted that
the lady urged his revisiting her house.
He thought that neither the age nor tho
beauty of the lady accounted for her I
stylish mode of dress, nor for the rays- |
tery of her existence, nor for the presence !
of her child, whose father was unkonvn
to all. This, it appears, told the witness \
that he was dealing with an adventuress, j
He heard that she had fine acquaintances. ;
including Dreyfus, and in view of the fact ;
I that in such companionship Dreyfus was
! liable to commit some imprudent action !
[ witness informed Lieutenant Colonel Ber- ;
| tin of his fears.
The last witness of the day. Captain
Maistre, read a letter from an officer now
at Nantes affirming that while he was on j
the general slaff as a probationer at the
same time as Dreyfus the latter told the
officer of his visit to Alsace-Lorraine, and j
!i< â¢;nited why he had followed the Ger
man maneuvers nn foot and on horse
back. This was intended to show Drey
fus was not telling the truth when he de
nied not having been present at any time
at the maneuvers at Alsace-Lorraine.
Another part of Captain Maistre's cvi- I
dence proved to be in favor of Dreyfus.
In contradiction of other witnesses who
declared that Dreyfus frequently staved
late in the office prying into other ofll
rets" duties Maistre declared that Dreyfus i
was disinclined to work and left often I
before the regular time.
Tho prisoner in the tone nf the calm
moderation which to-day distinguished
his utterances replied to Captain Malstre's
allegations and added with reference to
M. Beaurepaire's accusations that the hit
ter's immorality would ere long be dem
onstrated before the court-martial. The
court then rose for the daw

DERANGEMENTS OF
THE STOMACH
Dyspeptic and Catarrhal Affeo
tions Which Terminate in
Consumption
One of the most distressing ailments ta
which the human frame is subject Is dys-
pepsia. Creeping upon the victim silently
and scarcely without warning it soon
gains complete control, and after years of
unto'd agony the disorders generated
thereby develop into that most fatal of all
maladiesâ consumption.'
The failure of the stomach to digest
the food properly is the primary cause of
dyspepsia. Sick headaches, palpitations
of the heart, bilious attacks and other
disorders due to the impoverishment of
the blood then ensue. Lastly .come ca-
tarrhal, throat, bronchial and lung affec-
tions, which waste the frame, embitter
happiness and finally destroy life.
Dr." Tanner, the well-known English
author, says that "a dyspeptic stomach
is an .Unmistakable symptom of tubercu-
losis or consumption." It will be seen,
therefore, how necessary i; la to -combat
this terrible disease In its incipient stages
in order to avert the catastrophe which
follows neglect, no matter from what
cause.
In the treatment of catarrhal, throat,
bronchial and all Jung affections which
accompany dyspepsia Dr. Aborn is an
authority whose success has been phe-
nomenal. His practice now extends to
many States of the Union and numerous
cures accomplished by tneahi of corre-
spondence stand to his credit. It is only

PRESIDENT KRUGER AND HIS MARBLE LIONS.
' ihe linns that Barney Barnato presented to Mr. Kruger no doubt yield the President that dally reminder of
British might which Mr. Barnato probably intended. Anyway. Barney Barnato's gift contributes a pleasing irony to
the present situation."â Extract from the London Illustrated News
PRETORIA. Ausr. 22.â 1t is ascertained on the highest authority that no definite reply has been sent to the
osal of the British Secretary of State for the Colonies, Joseph Chamberlain, to submit to a joint commit
tee of inquiry the effect on the Outlanders of the recent franchise reforms. The precise situation is that, as
a result of tho pourparlers, a communication was dispatched yesterday to Sir Alfred Milner, British
High Commissioner in South Africa and Governor of Cape Colony, which embodies certain alternative pro
posals. For various reasons these are kept strictly confidential, but it is believed that they will admit of the con
n of a modus vivendi.
It is understood, from official sources of information, that the alternative proposals of the Transvaal Govern
ment are'for a' five years' franchise and one-fifth representation of the Outlanders in the first Raad, provided the
imperial Government does n>->t further interfere in the internal affairs of the Transvaal.
< >tTicial circles at present regard the situation as tending- to improve. The war ammunition consigned to the
South African republic is still detained by the Portuguese authorities in Delagoa Bay.
The Government of the Transvaal has received a communication from the Governor of Lourenzo Marques rela
tive to the stoppage of arms, to the effect that Portugal's obligations to all nations, including Great Britain, require
nforcement of the Transvaal-Portuguese treaty, and, as an unsatisfactory explanation existed as to the trans
ition of the arms, they were stopped at Delagoa Bay until the terms of the treaty are complied with, though
no doubt, the matter will ultimately be arranged satisfactorily. The Transval Government regards the communica
tion as "extremely vague."
LONDON, Augr. 22. â A Parliamentary paper dealing with the Transvaal crisis was issued to-day. It details
the efforts of the Boer Government during the past year to have the question of the suzerainty of Great Britain
submitted to arbitration and Great Britain's refusal to discuss this basic point. The document adds that Sir Al
fred Mflner. Governor of Cape Colony and High Commissioner of South Africa, writing to Mr. Chamberlain, the
Secretary of State for the Colonies, last June, said:
"The way in which the Secretary of State juggles with the convention of ISB4 Is rather irritating to a plain
man."
The final dispatch from Chamberlain, dated July 13, 1899. to Sir Alfred Milner, concurs with the latter*s views
as to the untenable Transvaal contention, adding that the British Government had no intention to continue to dis
cuss the question of suzerainty with the Transvaal.
The Johannesburg correspondent of the Daily Mail says: "The situation here is all the more alarming on ac
count of the great stagnation of trade, which causes acute distress to the small storekeepers and their employes."
CAPE TOWN, Aug. 22. â In the Cape Assembly to-day Cecil Rhodes, referring to the Transvaal question, said:
"No, there will be no bloodshed. President Kruger, like a sensible man, will climb down. The less the Cape
Colony is concerned in the quarrel the better."
'â  ntinuing, Mr. Rhodes said it was certain the Transvaal would become an English-speaking community,
and the Uitlanders, being in a vast majority, would form a government in keeping with their views. He expressed
the hope that the settlement would be fair, and that the Cape Colony would let the imperial Government deal
with the matter. It is rumored here also that the Boers intend to attempt a coup to obtain forcible possession of
the ammunition detained by the Portuguese.
JOHANNESBURG, Aug. 22.â The field cornets are busy distributing Mausers and ammunition to the burgh
ers. The exodus of miners continues.
KINGSTON, Jamaica, Aug. 22.â The Jamaican Government has offered a contingent of 300 native militia for
the support of the white troops ordered hence for service in the Transvaal. Wonderful enthusiasm has been
manifested in regard to enlistment for service in South Africa. When volunteers were called for an entire regiment

General Davis says: "Rations from I
Neuvitas may be unloaded in quaran

easier come from the States, the fear
of yellow fever from Cuba making ex
tra precautions necessary. The press |
reports that the Porto Ricans refused
to discharge relief supplies without
double pay are untrue. The MacPher-
B D arrived Saturday afternoon and un
loading proceeded Sunday morning.
The dock hands refused to work with
out the customary Sunday pay. The sol
diers of the Porto Rican Battalion vol
unteered to take their places, but the
longshoremen returned to work when
they learned the nature of the supplies
on board and unloading was completed
by them. Some refused any pay what- |
ever. Their original strike was due to i
a misapprehension. The stories that i
laborers in the interior refused to work |
because they are to be fed by the Gov
ernment is principally sensational talk ,
and hysterical. I can solve that mat- J
ter easily, as no issues will be made to j
those able to work unless they do so. |

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 23, 1899.
L. H. VAN SICKLEN
FIRED AT A DEER
Was Let Off With a Light
Fine.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAX RAFAEL. Aug. 22.â When it be
came known to-day that L,. H.Van Sick
len of the firm of Dodge. Sweeney &
Co., a wealthy member of the Country
Club, was arrested yesterday on a
charge of breaking the new Marln
County game ordinance, a sensation
was created. Not only was surprise
manifested on account of Van Sick
len's wealth and social position, but the
Country Club, of which he is a member,
was directly responsible for the enac
tion of the new game ordinance, and it
was hardly thought possible that an in
fluential member of that organization
would be among the first to violate the
law.
For some reason or other, the affair
is shrouded in mystery. The warrant
charging Van Sicklen with shooting at
a deer on the county roads was sworn
to by Thomas Irving, a deputy under
Game Warden Robertson", before Jus
tice George Rodden. Not an entry was
made in the Justice's docket, and When
questioned about it he flew into a fu
rious passion, even denying that the
warrant of arrest had been served. To
a friend Rodden admitted that Van
Sicklen had been fined the minimum i
penalty of $20, because he was a partic
ular friend.
Justice Rodden is of late being crit
icized in all quarters for imposing the
lightest fines in cases of cruelty to ani
mals for the alleged reason that he is
at outs with the society. Secretary
Case asserts that the Justice is serious
ly handicapping the society, and that
a meeting will be held In the near fu
ture to determine what course to pursue
in regard to his hostile attitude. The
method mapped out is to give all cases
of cruelty to animals to Recorder Gard
ner.

HARASS THE
AMERICANS
Four Hours' Combat in the
Intrenehments at
Angeles.
NEWSWMNSOREDj
! General Otis Prevented the Sending
of Detailed Accounts of the
Fighting. :
Special Dispatch to The Call.
MANILA, Aug. 19. via Hongkong i
Aug. 22.â The Filipino rebels
appear to retain much more of
a fighting spirit than might be
expected after their recent San I
Fernando experiences and General ,
Lawton's drubbings in the south. After ;
! giving up San Fernando with a feeble j
! struggle they intrenched themselves at j
Angeles, working for several days and
impressing non-combatants into the !
\ work, thus saving the armed men for j
the fighting. They engaged Lieutenant j
Colonel Smith's regiment and the artil- '<
â  lery warmly for four hours, making one !
of the most stubborn resistances of the '
: campaign. But the Americans are in
deb ted to the usual poor marksmanship
;of the Filipinos, as well as their own 'â 
', strategy, for their small losses.
In the province of Cavite, where it
was supposed the rebels had been scat
i tered and demoralized beyond recuper
i ation, they have assembled an army of
several thousand men, distributed
among the important towns from the
lake to the bay.
After the San Fernando engagement
the rebels attempted to deter the Amer- ;
icans from a further advance north
ward by menacing the railroad commu
nications. Several hundred of General j
Pio del Pilur's men crossed the Rio
Grande between the American outpost
towns and threatened Baluig, Quingui
and other places with small American
garrisons, while during Sunday and
Monday nights smaller bands tried to
tear up the railroad tracks at several
points between Bigam and Malolos. i
Reinforcements of American troops.
however, were I <-nt along the railroad
from Manila to San Fernando, while
the forces at Haluig and Quingui sal
lied out against General Pio del Pilar's
men and the rebels were easily driven
away.
In brushes between the Filipinos and j
the Americans during three days the '
Americans lost Beveral men, while the
Filipinos' loss was heavy.
<>f these operations the Associated
Press correspondents were permitted
only to send an inadequate dispatch,
dictated verbatim by Major General
Otis. The censor writes stereotyped of
ficial phrases and adjectives into the
dispatches, tending to magnify thd
American operations and to minimize
the opposition. General Otis pays the
newspapers are not public institutions j
but private enterprises, and the cor
respondents are only here on suffer
ance.
All reports from the rebel territory
agree that the .scarcity of food is in
creasing, and that the rebel com
manders at Aparty and other points
refused to obey Aguinaldo's orders in
regard to closing the ports held by the
rebels against American ships, and say
that any ship bringing stores will be
welcomed. Several ships from Manila j
are now at these ports.
Hundreds of people come into Manila !
daily and return to the rebel lines with
I food and other commodities. The
| guards stationed along the road re
! ported that 5000 persons passed
through the lines in three days, and
that forty-five tons <>f rice were car- '
ried out in small parcels on the same
road in ten days. Much of this un- j
doubtedly goes to aid the rebels, but
the authorities permit this traffic for
motives of charity toward the women
and children, who are undoubtedly
suffering.
General Mac Arthur is establishing
municipal governments in the villages !
north of Manial. The Mayor of Ba
luig, the first town where General '
Lawton established the same rule, who
was supposed to be one of the most
friendly and trustworthy of the na
tives, has been placed in jail, charged !
with arranging with the rebels for an
attack on the town.
The American troops have been with
drawn from all that part of the coun- j
try which was half cleared of rebels in 'â 
the expedition of the Americans in i
June last. The rebels have returned *o i
Pan Mateo, which was abarfdoned for >
the third time after its recent capture.
It is alleged that more than half the j
Howitzer ammunition used during the j
fight at Angeles was defective and
failed to explode.

in the ceremonies will doubtless be is- j
sued upon the return of Secretary Root
from Lake Champlain.
Just to what extent the participation
will be cannot be stated definitely by j
the department, but if troops should be \
desired for a parade, undoubtedly i
orders to bring about such participation
will be issued by General Merritt. It
will also be the duty of General Merritt
to give necessary instructions to the
commanding officers of forts along the I
bay to salute the admiral and the
Olympia as she comes toward the port
of New York and a salute in return will j
be fired by the warship.
No Information has been received j
from Admiral Sampson relative to the
programme he is preparing for the re
ception of the admiral, and Captain |
Evans has not as yet consulted with i
the admiral and the New York commit- !
tee, so far as known here, with refer- j
ence to the navy's participation in the j
ceremonies. The department expects to I
receive Admiral Sampson's recommen
dations and Captain Evans' report in
ample time to issue necessary orders.

WADE SENTENCED TO
LIFE IMPRISONMENT
Gillespie's Slayer Pleads Guilty to
Murder in the Second
Degree.
HONOLULU. Aug. 13.-George Wade,
the cook of the steamer Australia wnn
murdered William Gillespie, was allowed
to plead guilty on a charge of murder in
the second degree.
He was sentenced to serve a lire im
prisonment by Judge Stanley This was
a surprise to the defendant and his attor
ney as well as to the prosecution, for it
was thought the sentence would be for
twenty years only.
The court made a lengthy address in
delivering his sentence, reviewing the case
fully from beginning to end. He drew at
tention to the fact that Wade had Fhot
Gillespie a second time after he was down,
and had also tired at others, including Of
licer Harry Evans. The case was a par
ticularly provoking one arid called for the
greatest penalty the law could give.
Wade was taken at once from the court
room to Oahu Prison. During the reading
of the sentence Wade seemed cool, but
when the words "for life" were pro
nounced he evinced nervousness and al
most broke down.
Had the prisoner been given twenty
years commutation for good conduct
would have reduced his time to about
thirteen years.

made to improve the condition of the
councils. Santa Barbara Council did
not respond to the efforts made and
the council was suspended November
7, 189S, and was later dissolved by the
Supreme Council. Golden State Coun
cil No. 115 of Haywards has struggled
through adversities. Acting upon as
surances of the board of favorable ac
tion the council set to work in earnest
and gives promise of renewed and vig
orous life. A third council was organ
ized at Los Angeles on July 20. Efforts
to organize at Berkeley, Suisun, Wood
land and Auburn were ineffectual. At
the present time a movement toward
organization in the Richmond District,
San Francisco, and ' in St. Peter and
St. Paul parish, San Francisco, is being
fostered.
At the request of Supreme President
Kierce authorization was given for the
organization of detached councils in
Arizona, Utah and New Mexico. As a
result a detached council is now in ex
istence at Flagstaff, Ariz. Investiga
tions made as to conditions at Hanford,
Madera, Bakersfield and Porterville
show that while said localities should
in time offer opportunity for organiza
tion the present outlook is not such as
to promise success.
J. J. O'Toole, president of the lecture
bureau, reports that forty-five councils
have complied with the law in having
arranged and held their annual lec
tures.
At 5:30, after the adjournment of the
Grand Council, carriages were in wait-
Ing and the grand officers and the offi
cers of the local council enjoyed a drive
along the cliffs, through Twin Lakes to
the beautiful Catholic summer resort,
Santa Maria del Mar.
Here they were the guests at dinner
of Mrs. Margaret Deane, grand presi
dent of the Catholic Ladies' Aid So
ciety, and Miss Mary' Thompson, man
ager of the hotel for the Catholic
Ladies' Aid Society. The dinner was
an elaborate one and a social hour was
spent around the tables.
After dinner a social and informal
time was spent in the parlors of the
hotel with the guests, many of whom
are prominent officers and workers in ;
the Catholic Ladies' Aid Society and 'â 
the Young Ladies' Institute throughout
the State.
Officers will be elected Thursday and
the place of meeting for the next Grand
Council selected. The majority of the
delegates at present favor San Fran
cisco as the next meeting place.

FOUNDING A NEW
TOWN IN ALASKA
Claus Spreckels Buys a
Fishery.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
TACOMA, Aug. 22.â Ketchikan, Alas-
I ka, advices received to-day state that
thirty miles from there, on Prince of
Wales Island, there will soon be a new
town and one likely to be of some im
portance. Claus Spreckels has bought
the fishery at that point and has ar
rived with the first of the men and ma
terial which will lead to the building
of the town. The first step will be the
construction of large fish guano works,
similar, but on a far larger scale, to
those at Killisnoo. Two steamers have
! been engaged to carry the product di-
I rect to Hawaii, where there is a lucra
tive market for it.
Already an application has been made
for a Postoffice, the long distance and
; the rough passage to Ketchikan being !
a great inconvenience to a large num
ber of miners now working on the is
| land. One hears a great deal of Ketchi
| kan recently as a mining center, but
the fact is there are no mines there;
they are on Prince of Wales Island and
at Helm Bay. Marcus Daly's expert is
now at Ketchikan to look up rich cop
per propositions at those two points.
It is believed the next Congress will
I consent to open at least part of Annette
Island to mineral location. Missionary !
Duncan and his Indian settlers are !
making no use whatever of the exceed
ingly rich mineral deposits of the is
land and it is believed the right to lo
cate mining clams there may be fenced i
around with such restriction that it
will in no way interfere with mission
ary work.
The sole industry of the Indians is
comprised in the large cannery. It is
said a bill has already been drawn for
submission to Congress, to which Mr.
Duncan could take no possible excep
tion. In that case Mr. Spreckels' nt-w
town, as the center of a rich quartz '
mining district, is likely to grow sud
denly to a city of importance.

DIES IN LOS ANGELES
| Well-Known Liquor Salesman Sud

LOS ANGELES, Aug. 22.â Frank H.
I Taggart, one of the best known liquor
i salesmen in Southern* California, was
found dead in bed this morning at a
lodging-house, where he had been liv
ing since his return from Arizona about
a month ago. :â ;â¢â :â¢
Of late Taggart had been drinking
i heavily, but three or four days ago he !
I quit the use of liquor and said that. he i
â  intended to straighten up. Last night
! about 10 o'clock he was taken with a
j severe chill and asked the landlord to
j get him some . whisky and quinine, !
; which he did. After drinking the j
whisky, Taggart said he felt better and
was then left alone in his room.
Nothing was heard from Taggart
during the night, and this morning,
when he did not get up at his ( usual
time, the landlord made an investiga
tion and discovered the dead body. As \
i Taggart had always had more or less j
j trouble with his heart, it is supposed i
'â  that death resulted from that cause, i
: Taggart was 33 years of age. He leaves !

That's the universal verdict of

the oil fields of the world as a for-
tune : maker.
BECAUSE No. 2
The company is incorporated with
a capital stock sufficient to guaran-

BECAUSE No. 3
Sufficient stock has been placed in
the treasury of the company to off- "
set any possibility of assessments.
.The treasury stock to be sold from
time to time at the advancing prices
laid out by the Board of Directors
will give the company for develop-
ment purposes one hundred and
thirty-five thousand dollars. This
sum is sufficient to sink twenty-
five wells, each fifteen hundred feet
deep. As our experts predict oil on
our property at six hundred' feet it
would be almost beyond the range
of possibilities to expend this sum

UNIVERSALLY REACHED THAT
WEALTH IS NOT THE RESULT
OF HARD WORK. SELF DENIAL..

will undoubtedly bring hundreds,
and perhaps thousands, when oil is
struck. The oil fields of Pennsylva-

strated that fortunes can be made
quicker in oil stocks than any other
known investment entailing as
small an amount of risk. A rEW

Can you blame the hundreds who

University of California Crew Is De
feated After a Very Exciting
Race With Alameda
Spiders.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
ASTORIA. Or.. Aup. 22.â The weather
to-day was much better than yesterday
and the races were more Interesting.
The course was smooth in the morn
ing, but in tho afternoon the water was
rough and two of the shells filled. The
first event was the final heat in the out
rigger skiff race, the preliminaries of
which were run yesterday. There were
two contestants in the final, Ayres of
the Alamedas and Dennis nf the South
Ends. Ayres suffered from cramps in
both wrists during: the last quarter of B
mile, but had a good lead and finished
several lengths ahead of Dennis. This
event carried with it the Pacific Coast
championship. Ayres' time was 11:19.
Then the University senior crew went
against the Alameda Spiders. The
Btroke of the varsity four was ill and
his place was filled by Greenleaf,
trainer for the Alamedas. The college
men held the Spiders down until
within 150 yards of the finish, when the
Alamedas spurted and finished a length
ahead.
The double scull race betwe-en Alex
ander and Thompson, of Vancouver,
and Hart and Scott, of Portland, ended
in an unsatisfactory manner. The Brit
ishers led to the stake, in turning
which Alexander Lost his rowlock. The
Portlanders passed the Vancouver:?,
but, seeing the predicament of the-lat
ter, waited for them to come up so as
to make a race. Alexander rearranged
the rowlock and tried to row out the
race, but the lock soon got out of or
der again, and the Portlanders finished
ahead.
The four-oared shell race was parti
cipated in by a crew from the Alameda
club and one from Portland. The
Britishers, whose shell is frail, refused
to -nter, as the water was quite rough
and they were certain of losing their
boat. The Alameda shell filled before
the crew had gone a quarter of a mile.
For a time the men stayed with it, but
soon were compelled to swim. They
were pi ked up by a launch. The Port
land boat also shipped considerable
water, but although the shell was
nearly full the crew managed to finish.
The Britishers endeavored to secure
a postponement of this event, as they
were desirous of defeating the Port
landers, but the management refused
to do as requested. The Portland crew
went home to-night, several of the
oarsmen being members of the Naval
Reserve, which is to go "ii a cruise to
morrow, and Vancouver must await
another chance to settle matters.
The four-oared -barge race between
the Varsity crew and the Alamedas re
sulted in a victory for the latter. The
university crew put up a good race,
however, the Alamedas spurting and
! finishing a length ahead. The twenty
footer race was won by the Lark; time
1:29:20. In th" free-for-all sloop race

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 23, 1899.
J. REIFF, AMERICAN JOCKEY,
NOW WINNING IN ENGLAND
THE London Illustrated Sporting and Dramatic News in last week's issue
publishes the latest photograph of J. Reiff, the little American jockey, who
has in a measure Bupplanted Sloan. In passing, the paper also pays Ameri
can horses and also trainers a few compliments. What itt says follows:
"Times change and old tiling give place to now witlj ever-increasing
rapidity. There was a day when the British thoroughbred had no rival on any
r.' c course in the world. This is all changed now. and there never again will
be a raciiiK season in which many of our most important handicaps will not be
won by Australian and American bred racehorses. In the year 1599 are all
things American especially In evidence. The most successful trainer of the
day Is the American Huggins; the fashionable jockey of the season also hails
from thr States; the Yankee Democrat Is nearly the best two-yenr-old of the
year: the three-year-old Sibola. foaled on the other side, of the Atlantic, is the
best filly of her age. and the brothers Reiff, also born under the Stars and
Stripes, have already shown that if not so fortunate in their mounts as the fa
vorite of the hour. Sloan, they, too, can win races on English courses when their
horses are pood enough.
"The elder of those brothers is L. Reiff. who will be rermembered as riding
Mr. Wishard's horses in this country some years ago. and especially for being
on the back of the American horse Ramapo. who, owing to a smashed foot,
swerved all over the course and prevented Kilcock winning the Stewards'
Cup at Goodwood under 8 stone 4 pounds. It was hard lines for Captain Greer's
champion sprinter, who would otherwise have put in, a record performance, but
it was hardly the fault of Reiff, who is over here again this season riding for the
same owner. He cannot, however, go to scale at less than 8 stone 3 pounds,
whereas his younger brother, J. Reiff. whose portrait we give elsewhere, is one
of the smallest jockeys we have ever seen and can get up under <! stone. In
fact, he only weighs some 4 stone odd, and it is a fact that he is not big enough
to unsaddle his own horse.
"There was a terrible lot of dead weight under his saddle when he won the
New Biennial Stakes at Ascot on Bettyfleld, carrying 7 stone 3 pounds, and he
was quite unable to carry it all into the weighing room after unsaddling. He
adopts Sloan's style of riding to a certain extent, and it takes some looking to see
him at all as the horse he is riding comes up the course; but he rides a good
race, and in spite of his bodily weight, is much stronger than he appears to be.
His services are already in considerable request and are likely to be more so if
he continues to ride in this country. Moreover, he is a quiet, well-behaved lad,
â who is both popular among his fellow-horsemen and respected by his employ
ers. "

Their PermanentO.fi
cers Elected.
P. C. CURTIS FOR PRESIDENT
PREPARED FOR GRIEVANCES
WHICH MAY DEVELOP.
The New Organization of Coursing
Men Will Work Under the Rules
of the American Cours
ing Board.
The Greyhound Owners' and Trainers'
Protective Association of the Pacific
Coast became an acknowledged fact Wst
night. A permanent organization was ef
fected, the following officers being elected:
P. C. Curtis of San Jose, president ; Frank
Moran, first vice president; J. Keenan,
second vice president; W. C. Glasson, sec
retary; Hugh Lynch, treasurer; execu
tive committeeâ John Rocks, Joseph P.
Thrift, Walter Kay, L>. Toiand and James
K. Smith; membership committeeâCap
tain Clarkson, W. K. Thompson and A.
Johnson.
Constitution and by-laws were adopted.
The salient features of these are tha: the
executive committee shall stand between
the owners and the officials at parks
where they course their dogs and see they
are fairly and honestly dealt with. Pen
alties provided by the rules of the Ameri
can Coursing Board may be inflicted, but
no unjust punishment will be counte
nanced. Owners or trainers charged with
any offense shall be afforded every oppor
tunity to be heard in their own behalf.
The members of the association pledge
themselves not to enter their dugs at any
park where one of their organization has
been dealt with unjustly.
No stimulants other than those accept
ed as legitimate ones may be administered
to the dogs. No officials of coursing parks
can hold office in the association.
Frank Moran questioned that .section
of the constitution regarding grievances.
To his remarks Captain Clarkson replied
that the coursing- men have no set griev
ance at the present time, but were antici-'
pating the future. It was not a question
of grievance or of fighting the parks, but
they wanted to have an organization back
of them if anything did develop. The
only grievance at the present time, he
claimed, was that the nare corresponding
to the number drawn for a course was rot
always released.
Where rules of the American Coursing
Board do not apply in a case those of the
park are to be observed. The registra
tion of greyhounds by any club recog
nized by the American Coursing Board
will be accepted.
TALENT SURPRISED.
Favorite in the Grand Circuit Races
Loses to an Outsider.
READVILL.E, Mass., Aug. 22.â 1t was
practically straight heats in the grand
circuit races, an extra heat being required
in only an unfinished race of yesterday.
The track was fast. The great stake of
the day, the Blue. Hill, for the 2:30 trot
ters, was easy i for Kinpmond, the Ports
mouth horse being scarcely . pushed in
any of the three heats. The other events
passed off smoothly,, with Letah B taking
the unfinished 2:20 trot and Billy Andrews
the 2:25 pace. â¢ ,
It took two heats to finish the 2:20 trot,
which went over from yesterday, the
favorite, Letah S. breaking in the third
heat and coming in well behind. In the
fourth and deciding heat, however, she
took the lead at the start and was never
headed, winning easily.
The 2:25 pace was soon over, for the
favorite, Billy Andrews, led in every heat,
his driver pulling him up in the last one
to give the other horses a rating.
In both heats of the 2:16. trot Tessie S
pressed Rubber hard. In the first she fin
ished a neck behind,' but in the second
she broke just before the finish and Rub
ber came in three lengths ahead.
Hallie Rocket vied with Klngmond for
favoritism in the stake race, but the
mare went off her feet soon after the
start and the Portsmouth horse kept the
lead to the finish. Kingmond had a pretty
fight with Wilask in the second heat and
with Valpa in the third, but neither could
catch him. v*/^^
The 2:10 trot was a surprise, Bouncer
taking both heats and the race, while the
favorite, Battleton, did not seem to have
the speed. In the first heat the bay mare
kept the pole from the start, and although
closely pressed at the half by Captain
Jack, managed to hold the lead to the
wire. The time, 2:09. was the fastest of
the day. The second heat was almost a
repetition of the first, Bouncer never be
ing headed, although she showed signs of
distress in the stretch, and Belle J, com
ing strong, almost caught her at the wire.
Again the favorite, Battleton, finished
behind. Results:

of the executive committee of the Afro-
American Council a resolution was adopt
ed indorsing the anti-lynching bill pre
sented to the recent convention by Attor
ney Edward E.^Jrown of Boston. The bill

The series of boxing bouts at the Ob
servatory Athletic Club on the apex of
Telegraph Hill last night were practically
refereed by Lieutenant of Police Esola.
He occmpied a seat at the ringside and
cautioned the boxers whenever they re
sorted to rough tactics. In only one in
stance did he permit a bout to run its full
course. This was for six rounds, the con
testants being W. Condan and M. Mc-
Clure. The decision went to the forn*r.
and a negro. The latter was knocked
down several times in the third round,
when the police interfered. Charles* Re
vani and Harry Slmi were stopped in the
The opening bout was between J. Wise
second round, Siml being palpably out of
condition. The bout between "Kid" Daily
and William Vaccari was not allowed to
proceed, as one of the contestants was not
L'l years of age.
The last bout and the best on the pro
gramme was between Jack Dean, and Ed
die Foy. The latter had a slight lead
over his antagonist until the seventh
round. In this there was an exchange of
left swings, Foy being knocked to his
knees. He remained down eight seconds.
When they resumed boxing again Lieu- j
tenant Esola ordered the men from the
ring. The referee awarded the bout to
Dean. One of Foy's seconds tried to
make a speech, but was bustled over the
ropes and out of the ring by Esola.
There was a fair attendance, the occa
sion being a benefit for "Cocker" Tweedie,
the clever Australian boxer.

BRYAN DICTATES DEMOCRATIC
PLATFORM.
It Declares for Free Coinage of Sil

Special Dispatch to The Call.
OMAHA. Aug. Nebraska Democrat?,
Populists ajid Silver Republicans met in
this city to-lay and fused on nomina
tions for Judge of the Supreme Court and
two members of the Board of Regents of
the State University. . Former Governor
Silas A. Holcomb was minated for Su
preme Justice by the Populists and in
dorsed by the other two conventions.
Mr. Bryan dictated the platform of the
Democratic convention. This document
declared uncompromisingly for free coin
age of silver at the ratio of 16 to 1 and
indorses bodily the Chicago platform ol
IS&S. The platform of the Populist con
vention indorsed the platform of the Pop
ulist national convention of 1896 and ir
addition contained planks denouncing th^
policy of the administration in the Phil
ippines. The platform of the Silver P.*>
publicans was much the same and con
tained in addition a pianK declaring
against the use of railroad passes by pub
lic r.3ic:a!s.
Mr. Bryan addressed all three conven-
Uons ana sis emphatic tn his denuncia
tion of the administration's policy in Ctu
Philippines. He supported tree silver.
For Regents of the SÂ«.ate Cniversity thÂ«
convention nominated Edson Rich 01

On the question of trust! thÂ» platform
declares:
The industrial trusts, sprinsr-n? up on e^very

it. We denounce the failure of thÂ» adminis

;ruÂ«ts or to reoc-nmond new laws if the pres
ort law Is deemed ir.su ff.ciÂ»nt.
We are opposed tv the rrmcipie of monopoly
v-htrever it manifests itself. We demand the
enforcement of the present Federal law. the
enactment ct such nÂ«>w legislation is maybe ne
cessary, ar.d a constitutional amendment, if the
I resÂ«nt constitution is construed to protect
trusts, to the end that the monor-r.lization of
industry by private corporations may bÂ» abso
lutely prevented. Every trust r*sts upon a cor

of laws, and the law. SI â¢- and National,

ThÂ« platform praisÂ«?s Nebraska - idlers
for thtir part in the war in the Philip
pines, and goes on to say:
But while we cornrcerfd the soldiers for
ob^iience to all orders emanating from thÂ«
chief executive, we condemn the administra
tive r>:>iicy which ha^ converted a war for
humanity sake Into a war for conquest. WÂ«
believe the Filipinos should have received the
same treatment as the Cubans, and that as thÂ«
Cubans were assured of ultimate Independence
and protection, so the Filipinos should have
been assured in the beginning of our nation' i
intention to give them independence as soon
as a stable Kovemmen' should b* established
ar.d protection from outside interference. Such
aÂ«uran?e should be given now. If the Cuba.ns,

SIGNALS CARRIED BY
WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY
Test Made by Lighthouse Department
Between Staten Island and
New York.
NEW YORK. Aug. 22. â Experiments have been conducted in wireless
telegraphy for some timÂ» by the Lighthouse Department at Tompkins
vilie. Staten Island. Th experiments have been in charge of TV. J.
Clarke, general manager of the United States Electrical Supply Com
pany, and after some , preliminary work he has succeeded in signal
ing clearly and loudly between Tomkinsville and pier No. 5. East River.
clear across the Bay of New York. So greatly interested in the new
.telegraphy were the Government officials that Major Hoxy. secretary to
th? ohi-Â»f engineer of the Lighthouse Board, and Frank A. Vanderlip, As
sistant Secretary of the Treasury, decided to see the system in practical
operation; therefore a ianre Clarke transmitter was placed on thÂ» end
of the pier at Tompkinsville. This instrument consisted of specially
wound and insulated sparks, the. duration of which were controlled by
a specially constructed telegraph key.
As the boat left Tompkinsville pier and got well out into the mid
dle of the bay it was apparent to all that the Instrument was capable
of doing much more than had been thought, and to the surprise of the
entire party the vibrating bell continued ringing twice each half min
ute until the Mistletoe arrived at pier No. 5, East River, where the
receiver was disconnected, these signals being sent out regularly on a
transmitter by the man in charee of the apparatus at Tompkinsville.
Mr. Clarke predicts that there will be no difficulty whatever In ulti
mately transmitting to a distance of fifty miles or more. In fact, he con
tends that at present the electrical fraternity is working around in the
dark with some new subtle agency which none understand, and with
which it is impossible to say how much can be accomplished. Mr.
Clarke thinks, however, that ultimately the matter of distance will
mean absolutely nothing, and that It will be just as easy to converse
by telephone across the Atlantic Ocean as It Is to-day to transmit wire
less telegraphic signals a few miles.

ROSS NO LONGER
FOR FREE SILVER
Stanford Man's Change
of View.
Spec -' DtcjuOcfc to The Call.
PAL'"' ALTO, Aug. 22.â Professor E.
A. R'.-ss head of the department of
a returned to the university
y. aft<=T spending one year in
Europe. While abroad he devoted hi?
in the libraries of London and
Paris . g on a new book. In an
Interview he c) - himself freely
on the money question, imperialism
and the genera! situation in Europe.
Dr. Ross formerly was a bimetallist.
In resj â -â  | the question, '"In view
of the situation abroad do you think
that the United States should adopt
bimetallism 16 t" 1?" he replied:
"No. I think that the demand of 16
to 1 has ceased to be admissible."
"Have you not then changed your
es?"
The principle I hold is that
y should be as far as possible
stable in value. The free coinage of :
at 16 to 1 was merely a policy in
: to r<=-a!:z-:- thifl - I think
that free coinage at 16 to 1 no longer .
promises to realize this principle."
Why not?"
reasons. In the first
place the annual gold output has since
-hoi up from S. 0 to $300,
--0. The amazins production of
South Africa and the Yukon region is
thing that no one could foresee.
It '-^rtainly relieves the monetary
famine and has tended to reduce if not
entirely wipe out the annual apprecia- '
tlon of gold. In the second place,
three r r m^r^ yp^rp of debts have been
incurred under the gold standard and
nding mas- : | debt in- I
curred since the bimetallic standard
has been wiped out. In the third
place there was a likelihood in :â â â 
that certain other nations would follow
a bold step n n the part of thÂ« United
States, and thus independent action nn
our part might bring about interna
tional bimetallism. We have no longer
any ground for such a hope. For these ;
thr<>.Â» reasons a proposal which was
reasonable in IS% becomes extreme in
1899."
In regard to the question of imperial
ism he said:
"I am strongly opposed to the whole
colonial venture, not on humanitarian
grounds, but on account of the havoc
that imperialism will certainly work in
our political development. In order to
make fortunes for two or three thou
sand American business men the plain !
people will not only have to pay the big j
bills of imperialism, but will* see the
legislation they need sidetracked by a
clever manipulation of foreign ques
tions. The English oligarchy always '
keeps half a dozen smoldering wars
along the borders of the British empire
BO that one fan always be cnnveniently
fanned into flame if it becomes neces
sary to divert attention from honi"
matters. Does any one suppose that the
aggressions of railroads or trusts or
telegraph companies or subsidy hunting
steamship lines or protected interests
will be withstood when a vast tangle of
colonial and foreign business absorbs
thf attention of the public and of Con
gress
"The caf of England convinces me
that the autocratic government of rip
pendencies reacts upon and modifies
home government. For us to abandon
our principles of government by con
sent for the sake of trade and exporta
tion in the Philippines is to barter our
birthright for a mess of pottage."

Special Correspondence of The Call.
HONOLULU. Aug. 15.â The final chap
ter in the life of the ill-fated City of Co
lumbia may now be written. On Thurs
day last she sailed for Hongkong with a
crew of forty all told, with officers and
men. a:.<; yesterday nineteen of them re
turned with the report that she was foun
dering" off the coast of Kauai.
The tale as told by Chief Officer Carlson
and substantiated with variations in de
tail by the, other eighteen is that the
vessel started out well enough for Hong
kong and kept to a pace of about nine
knots an hour for some hours. Shortly
before daylight the next morning, when '
some seventy miles off the coast of Nil
hau. it was discovered that she was leak
ing heavily at the stern port chasing!
Pumps were unavailing,}- Bet to work, for
the water gained so rapidly that the fires
were extinguished within two or three
hours. With thÂ»Â» pumps working the water
gained nearly two feet in the hour.
Sails were hoisted, but the vessel merely
rolled like a log in the trough of the sea. i
The twice broken-backed steamer was a
wreck.
Captain Walker at once ordered the life- ;
boats out and dispatched two of them.
with Officer Carlson and the others re
ferred to, in search of aid, as the derelict
then had some say seven and others
eleven feet of water in her hold and was
rapidly settling by the tern. The men
landed* at Mar.a. Kauai, about 2 o'clock on
Saturday morning and were taken by â 
special train to Waimea.
The steamer James Makie was at Ka- |
paa and at once went to Walmea and
brought the shipwrecked men to Hono
lulu it being well known that Captain
Walker and the rest of the crew were in
boats waiting for the hoodoo's demise.
The United States steamship [roquois
was cot ready as rapidly as possible and *
sent to the scene of the disaster, and to- |
day the Hawaiian tug Glen was sent. â¢
The Iroquols returned this morning
from Waimea with Captain Walker and ,
the remainder of the crew of the Colum- !
bia, which foundered about eight hours
after the first two boats left her. No
lives were lost and the ship now sleeps in \
one of the deepest parts of the Pacific
OXNARD SUGAR FACTORY
IN FULL OPERATION
The First Day's Output of the
New Concern Eagerly-
Bought Up.
HUENEME, Aug. 22.â T0-day at
Oxnard the first sugar made in Yen- ;
tura County was turned out by the i
American Beet Sugar Company's far- j
tbry, the first beet sugar factory in j
the United States to begin operations '
thi= season. The sugar is the finest
pra'ie that has been seen in these parts
B extra bright and dry and of
t granulation.
Lehmann <k Waterman, the leading
merchants of the county, have se- â 
cured the first three carloads of to- |
day's output. Preparations had been i
made to open the campaign several
weeks ago, but owing to the newness
of the machinery and to several mis
haps which hav'.- occurred in different
parts of the factory, operations have '
been delayed. The output for the pres
ent will b* - - f sugar ] lay,
but it is the calculation to double this
in a few weeks. The factory will run |
continuously night and day for the |
:>-xt four months, when lnO.<w> tons <->f ;
beets will have been converted int..
sugar.
The town of Oxnard. wh^r* the fac
tory :s located, is the liveliest muni
cipality in the State. Buildings cannot
be erected fast enough to accommo
date prospective settlers, whil^ those
who wish to be on the ground and
watch the progress of this thriving
burg have pitched their tent? where.
with th^ir families, they will await
thÂ«ir turn in securing more substantial '
homes. The plat of th^ town was laid j
out in January. 1898, and the popula- j
tio n of Oxnard to-day is over 2000 and j
is increasing rapidly.

VILLAGE IN JAPAN
DESTROYED BY FIRE
One Hundred Dead Found in the
Ruins and Seven Are Reported
Missing.
VICTORIA. B. C., Aug. 22.â The
Japanese st-amer Kinshiu Maru brings
news oft a serious conflagration in
Araimachi prefecture, which wiped the
village of E< higo off the map. Four
hundred houses, mostly bamboo-buiit
structures, were destroyed and 120 Jap
anese lost their lives.
Tho fire originated in the home of one
of the villager?. A high wind was pre
vailing at the time and the flames
swept like a sea over the hamlet. The
Japanese Bremen, with their limited ap
paratus, were unable to do anthing
whatever to stay the flames and they
were left to burn themselves out. When
the embers cooled it was found that 120
were dead and seven were missing.
A.bout the same time as Echigo was
swept out by fire the villages of Mizo
nobe and Mura in Yamaeruta was swept

SOLDIERS AND
POLICE CLASH
Indiana's Men Cause
Trouble in Honolulu.
THEY RESENT AN ARREST
TRY TO TAKE A PRISONER FROM
THE POLICE.
Lieutenant and Fourteen Men De
mand the Return of a Man
Charged With Drunk
enness.
Special Correspondence of ThÂ» Call.
HONOLULU, Aug. 22.â The United
States transport Indiana arrived from
San Francisco on the 10th and after re
maining- thirty-six hours in port, sailed
again on the 11th. While the vessel was
in port there was a serious clash between
the police and soldiers.
The trouble started in a small way.
Two officers had a drunken soldier in
tow and were taking him to the station.
Three soldiers appeared, and on their re
quest the prisoner was turned over to
them with the understanding that they
would take their comrade to the vessel.
The four soldiers started down togeth
er, but had not gone far when the man
in liquor assaulted his companions and
a rough and tumble fight ensued. Finally
the intoxicated boy in blue broke away
and started to run up the street. He was
caught by the same policeman, and this
time the lieutenant insisted that he
should report to the deputy marshal at
the station.
Then a second complication arose. Some
th.rty stray soldiers who had gathered in
the street set about to rescue the man
from the police. One big fellow raised
his hat and gave the command to move
forward. A start was made, but the po
lice drew their clubs.
At this juncture a noise was heard up
Nuuanu street. Coming down on a run
was a second lieutenant and a platoon
of thirty-two men, all armed and looking
like business. The' troops moved in the
middle of the thoroughfare and cleared
the street as they went. Near the corner
of Merchant and Nuuanu streets the
troops came up with the police struggling
with the soldier.
Then came the serious part of the affair.
The troops were halted in line. Four men
stepped out with fixed bayonets and
marched with their lieutenant to Lieu
tenant Opunui and demanded th* release
of the soldier. The army officer was told
that his request would now have to be
made to the proper authority at the
station house. At this the army men be
came greatly excited and brought their
arms to a charge. The police, now in
creased to three men, drew their clubs
and defied the soldiers. In the meanwhile
they kept moving with their prisoner, and
in a few minutes landed him in jail.
While this was going on the stray
soldiers and those in the detachment had
become a howling mob. Those in ranks
broke and most of them fixed bayonets.
Their commander seemed to have no con
trol over them. In the full of the excite
ment the prisoner dealt Officer Poha
kupaa a heavy blow in the face and
knocked him down. The officer came
back immediately with a sweeping swing
and aid the soldier out. This proceed
ing got the mob simply furious. Withal
and through ail the police remained
cool, and continued to urge their prisoner
to the station. . .
When the man was safely landed in jail.
the army tenant turned to his men
and ordered them forward. The platoon
marched around the corner and drew up
In line in front of the station house. The
lieutenant went Inside to Interview
Deputy Marshal Chlllingswortb. That
officer heard the statements of Lieutenant
Opunui and also of the army men. Con
siderable heat was displayed by the lat
ter.
Chlllingsworth took the pains to ex
plain to the army officer what the custom
was with respect to soldiers. When a
man was arrested there was never ob
jection tc turning him over to the proper
authority by the proper authority. The
man could go on condition that the lieu
tenant would guarantee that he be taken
off the streets and safely landed aboard
ship. This was done.

THE DECORATION OF THE CITY.
WHILE the decorations of the streets along the
line of march" fixed for the grand parade of tin
returning volunteers will be the most artistic
and elaborate ever seen in this city, the people should
not rest content with the accomplishment of that
much. The whole city should be adorned with
streaming colors, living flags and banners bearing
legends of welcome to the heroes.
Of course the committee cannot undertake the gen
Â» era! decoration. It must be left to the patriotic im
pulses and the artistic taste of the householders.
During the outburst of popular patriotism that fol
lowed the declaration of war nearly every well-to-do
family in the city made a national flag a part of its
household ornaments and treasures. In the early days
of the war the city was radiant with banners from
morning to night. When the volunteers from the
other States arrived here they found the streets not
only downtown but in the residence districts so pro
fusely adorned with Hags and bunting that the whole
city appeared in festal array.
Now the time has conle to make use of all .those
flags arid to add to their number. From every office,
store, shop, hotel and home throughout the city the
starry banners should be flung to the breeze. Wher
ever the boys go on the way to their homes after dis
bandment they should find the streets made bright
and beautiful by the glow of the national colors, and
words of welcome should meet their eyes on all sides.
The departure of the volunteers for the war was
accompanied by the most ardent manifestations of
pride in their heroism and love for their loyalty.
Now let their home-coming be made as glorious as
their iprvirr.
THE MUNICIPAL CONVENTIONS.
NOTWITHSTANDING the prevailing interest in
the preparations lor the reception of the home
coming volunteers, it is the duty of citizens 1 â >
give close attention to the political work carried on
during the week by the county conventions of the
two parties. The Democratic convention assefnbled
last night, and the Republican convention meets this
evening. The i>^ueÂ» with which tiny will (leal are of
importance to every citizen, and a close watch should
be *ept up<m every step of the proceedings in both
bodies,
In the Democratic convention it is a foregone con
clusion the self-appointed committee of one hundred
guardians, trustees and directors of San Francisco
Democracy will have their own way and nominate
whom they please. The rc-ult will doubtless be a
ticket something like that which gave San Francisco
in the Board of Supervisor* preceding the present one
a municipal and county government of so outrageous
a kind that Mayor Phelan undertook to remove the
Supervisors by main force and did on one occasion
have them hauled out of the council chamber in the
City Hall by the police.
These things being so, it is to the Republican con
vention the better element of the city now looks for a
ticket whose election will assure good government.
The outlook promises well. The would-be bosses of
the partyâ Kelly, Crimrains and Bums, with all their
jnish â were defeated at the primaries and the rank
and file of the party representing true Republicanism
achieved a sweeping triumph. It is now to be seen
how far the delegates will fulfill the expectations of
those who voted for them.
The combined forces which will be arrayed against
the Republicans in this contest cannot be beaten by a
weak ticket, nor even by a strong ticket unless it be
supported by a strong and energetic county commit
tee, made up of men in whom not only Republicans
but independent voters have confidence. The selec
tion of good candidates and good committeenicn is
therefore the duty imposed upon the convention by
the responsibilities of the situation as -a ell as by the
expectations of the party.
Up to this point every step taken in the campaigu
has been in the direction of a triumph for honest Re
publicans. The attempts of the bosses to hold the
primary elections by a blanket ticket tvere beaten.
ThHr efforts to win out at the primaries under the
district system of electing candidates to the conven
tion were beaten. It remains now to defeat any
schemes they may device in the convention to put
their representatives as candidates on the ticket or as
members of the committee. Having thus purified it
self of boss control, the Republican party can com
plete the good work by defeating the Democratic
bosses at the polls and redeeming the city from boss
domination altogether. Such a consummation is well
worth working for in earnest and with tireless energy.
. Farmer? throughout California are reported to be
suffering from a sudden jump in rope. Judge Lynch
has had nothing to do with it, either. j
CALIFORNIA TEA.
T-JJE people of this State have long known its
possibilities and the variety of its resource.
Natifre favors the production of many things
j here. We arc so situated that we may draw upon two
i zones and gather, from the northward and the south
ward, plants that produce what man needs to supply
his necessities and comforts and luxuries. The ques
tion of labor enters into the economic production of
much that nature favors, (live us the labor fitted to
â â  it. in cost and application to detail, and we can pro
duce silk without limit. The mulberry flourishes here,
and the silkworm reduces it to liber. But the industry
requires a surplus of domestic labor or of hired labor
at a low wage. The care of the moth and worm and
the winding of cocoons, the primary processes in pro
duction, stand in the way of immediate development.
It is probable that when California has about triple
: her present population the surplus of domestic labor
: will enable silk culture on a significant scale. Then
may be found in a majority of country homes the
time and skill required to produce and fit the raw silk
for the manufacturer, and it may then become as com
mon as wool is now.
After his recent visit here the Secretary of Agricul
ture is quoted as saying: "One of my pet schemes
I has been tea culture in the United States. This
project I have nursed in my own mind for many
years. The department has been developing tea
plants at Washington in great quantities, and it pro
poses to distribute in favorable localities some four-
I teen million shrubs. < >ne of the chief purposes of my
/â trip across the Rocky Mountains was to find soil and
J climate that would be favorable to the culture of te:i.
i This I did find in California. Just where I cannot
i tell you at present. However. I am satisfied Calif or
j nia has the right soil and climate in abundance. The
Agricultural Department will push its experiments at
once."
The Secretary is right. If he had confided his pur
, pose to our people while here he could have been
shown tea plants, long growing and thrifty, in the
western foothills of the Sierra, and could have prob
: ably been furnished a cup of California tea.
The shrub was experimented with long ago. and the
capacity of our soil and climate to produce it is as
well established as their friendliness to silk culture.
At present the obstructing element is the same as in
silk. It is a question of the lack of abundant and
cheap labor. Rural families in the foothills have pro
duced tea for their own use, though its quality would
be improved by more knowledge of the processes of
picking, drying and preparing the leaf.
Tea-planting has also been tried successfully in
1 South Carolina, and in that State appears no natural
obstacle to its development. Before the abolition of
slavery it had come to be regarded as a possible in
dustry of great value. Since the substitution of free
for slave labor it is subjected to the same conditions as
| in California.
It is to be hoped that the Secretary will send -i
' generous portion of his tea plants here. If a few
ranchers in the foothills, who will treat them intelli
gently, can get them and get proper instruction in
picking and curing the leaf, there will be laid the
foundation for production in commercial quantities.
It is not to be expected that any one will devote the
; land and the capital required to put out at once i
i large commercial plantation of tea. But when a large
number of ranchers have by the use of an acre or two
shown the merit and profit of the industry, its enlarge
ment may be expected..
Tea grows in our latitudes in China and Japan, and
it is noteworthy that the industry began there by the
i production of tea for domestic use by the producer, j
I and never became of commercial importance until |
its use had been domesticated in Europe.
The next visit we have from the progressive Secre
tary of Agriculture he must be shown the tVa shrubs
i of California, which have long stood as witnesses to
I our capacity to supply a cup of American tea.

GOVERNMENT IN BUSINESS.
I
THE Democracy is no doubt just now under the
heavy thumb of two national bosses. Governor
Altgeld and Colonel Bryan. When the Ken
tucky bolters gathered in their convention they wired
i Altgeld for orders and he responded with his com
; mands. adding, "If you don't do this you would bet
ter adjourn." In the lowa convention Mr. Cato
Sells was the leading candidate for Governor. His
nomination was believed to be the only tiling nece 3 
' sary to unite the two factions of the party by cutting
' loose from the Populists. Colonel Bryan appeared in
: Dcs Moines. made two speeches, put his orders on the
I delegates, and Mr. Selis withdrew from the contest,
! declaring that it was by Colonel Bryan's dictation.
Such a situation never before appeared in a national
party. It i> evident that under this duplicate dictator
ship the platform of 1896 will be readopted and with
i additions that will be novel.
Altgeld, in his Chicago interview, said that it must
have a plank in favor of Government ownership of
all the leading business activities. He declared that
the growing tendency to municipal ownership was the
entering wedge to Federal ownership, and that mv
' nicipal ownership, wherever tried, had proved the
I wisdom of the scheme.
It i- well, in view of this surely impending policy,
to go back to the argument first used in this country
in favor of the Government going into business.
It began with the experience of the city of Glas
gow. It was widely published and is still current that
Ihe people of Glasgow pay no taxes, and that the
whole government is supported by the income of the
strtet railways and of the water and fms plants.
Recently Mr. Robert Watt of this city, one of the
i -.ve'l-kpown promoters of the Valley road, inquired
Â«.f a friend in Glasgow as to the facts touching the
frccdrm from taxation of the people of that ci'y.
The Oakland Enquirer has published the response.
The facts are found to be, first, that the basis of muni
cipal taxation in Glasgow, as in all other municipali
: tics in the British i?les, is the rental value of property.
Property is taxed upon a certain rate per pound ster
ling of its leasable value. Property with a rental
value of more than $50 per annum is taxed two
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 23, 1899.
shillings and twopence per pound sterling, or 52 cent.}
per pound, or eleven per cent of the income, and
property of a less rental value is taxed one shilling
and sixpence per pound, or seven and one half per
cent of its rental value. The Enquirer, comparing
this with taxation in Oakland, finds that in the latter
city the rate runs from ten to fifteen per cent of the
rental value of property, or an average but slightly
in excess of the average property tax for municipal
purposes paid by property in Glasgow. S<> far the
facts settle question of the levy and collection of
city taxes in Glasgow, and the very slight difference
between their amount and the taxes paid in Oakland.
Now. as to municipal ownership. Glasgow lias a
population of 800.000. in round numbers. Before that
j cit\ took ownership of the street railways they paid
tc it an annual rental of $13,000 for use of the streets.
The profit to the c-ity of operating the roads is now
$45,000 per year, or a gain in income over the former
street rentals of only $32,000. As the city issued in
terest bearing bonds to buy the roads, it would add
to the interest of the statement if their amount were
known and the annual interest charge and whether
the latter is first taken out before the net profit of
$32,000 is made to appear. Of course the presump
tion is that this is done, though it is not stated. The
wages paid to employes on the Glasgow street rail
ways average $5 25 per week of sixty hours. Here,
again, it would be interesting to know if this wage is
more or less under municipal than under corporate
ownership.
The charge for city gas in Glasgow is a fraction
above 50 cents per thousand cubic feet, but the gas
coal costs only $1 50 per ton, and the local market
takes the by-products of gas-making at a handsome
profit. The water rates do not seem to pay the cost
of supply, for there is a general levy of 12 cents on
every $5 of property value for water.
The Glasgow gentleman who furnishes the state
ment says that the story that the income of the street
railways supported the whole cost of the city govern
ment probably rose out of the fact that these railways
arc able to maintain themselves without an annual
deficiency to be met by the taxpayers.
While the facts as shown are of the greatest inter
est, they are by no means complete. In addition to
the lack already mentioned it would be interesting to
know how much taxable property was lost to the city
when it became owner of the roads. Its income from
such taxation should be set against its profit of
$32,000, and would probably show an actual deficit
lof a large amount as the result of. the change. As the
question of municipal ownership, originally set in mo
tion in this country by the mistake about Glasgow's
freedom from tax, is in agitation in this city, the ex
perience which bears upon it is of very great interest
to our people.
THE KAISER AND THE FRENCH.
KAISER WILLIAM has given the world another
evidence of his desire to win the- favor of the
French. He has followed his visit to a French
naval training ship and his complimentary address on
that occasion by unveiling on the battle-field of St.
Privat, near Metz, a statue designed to commemorate
the valor of the men of both armies.
His words were notably strong and clear. He is
reported to have said: "I desire that the meaning of
this figure be generally known. It stands on this field
as a guardian of all the brave soldiers of both armies,
French and German, who fell. The French soldiers j
who found a glorious grave at St. Privat also fought |
bravely and heroically for their Emperor and father
land. When our flags are lowered in greeting before
this bronze statue and flutter mournfully over the
graves of our dear comrades may they wave over the
tombs of our foes and whisper that we think sorrow
ing!}" of their brave dead. With deep thanks and an
upward glance to the Lord of Hosts for the guidance j
he so mercifully vouchsafed to our great Emperor. !
we will recall that the countless souls of all who once
stood face to face in hot encounter will look down ;
upon us tlii- day from where they stand around the i
throne of the Supreme Judge, united in eternal 'â 
peace.
There is in our language a mocking proverb which
declares, "Soft words butter no parsnips." but from
the wisdom of the ancients there comes a fuller truth
in the saying. "A soft answer turneth away wrath."
The course of the powerful Emperor of Germany in
persistently speaking conciliatory words is bound to !
have its effect upon the minds of the French. He may
not lead them to put away the dream of a victorious
war that will enable France to recover her lost prov
inces, but he will certainly allay irritation and antag
onism and thus check any desire on the part of the j
French to hasten the coming of that war.
According to a story which has been going the '
rounds for some time, the Kaiser is very eager to at
tend the exposition in Paris next year, and it has
been said all his kind speeches are designed merely
to enable him to accomplish that purpose. It is !
hardly likely, however, that the Kaiser has been j
moved by so slight a motive. It is more probable he j
desires to visit Paris for the purpose of conciliating I
the French than that he desires to conciliate the
French for the purpose of going to Paris.
All the great statesmen of Europe arc impressed
with the conviction that the balance of power on that
continent is in a state of instable equilibrium. An
outbreak in the Balkan States or in the Turkish em
pire may involve the Continent in a general war anJ
lead to a reconstruction of the political map. More
over, the whole structure of society is insecure. The
oppressive burden of immense standing armies is felt
everywhere, and socialism in one direction and
anarchy in another tend equally to undermine the
fabric of government.
Under such conditions it is not strange a wise
ruler should seek to allay old enmities and make
friends with his neighbors. There are reasons for be
lieving Russia, a power that is as much Asiatic as
European, has been playing fast and loose with Euro- j
pran alliances for a long time. The German Emperor |
may not have much fear of a Russian alliance with
France, but he can have as little confidence in Rus
sian friendship for Germany. In any case it is better j
for Germany to have the friendship of France, and the I
Emperor is doing all he can to attain it.

COMMUNICATIONS
WAR CORRESPONDENTS.
Editor of The Call: The San Francisco
Chronicle of July 27, lVift, contained an
editorial alleging the following' facts:
1. That the war correspondents at Ma- j
nila were misleading: the Amprican peo- |
pie and attempting to punish .General
Otis. r
2. That censorships, such is General
Otis was enforcing, had been maintained
ever since war correspondence was in
vented.
3. That "during the Civil War General
Sherman threatened to hang Whitelaw
Reid, correspondent of the New York
Tribune."
4. "'That he (General Sherman) turned
Murat Halstead out of the army in the
must summary fashion."
5. "That General Grant also made an
example of another famous correspon
dent. "In each case where the presence
of :i newspaper writer was tolerated his
letters and telegrams were rigidly super
vised."
My communication published in The < "all

ments to be untrue.
The Chronicle of August fi had an edi

ence to Sherman's threats against Reid
and refers me to the files of the New York
Independent for proofs of its statement
concerning Sherman and Halstead.
i have only to reiterate the statement
that both these latter charges against
General Sherman are false and to de
mand specific proof of their truthfulness.
It matters not what the Independent may
have published. I am safe in saying Sher
man never threatened in any public man
ner to hang Reid; nor did he run llal-<tÂ« ad
out or the army for articles written by
him as a war correspondent. When any
responsible person will furnish . reason
able proof over his own signature that
either is true I will apologize to all con
cerned or traverse the statement to the |
satisfaction of all concerned. Certainly !
neither Reid nor Halstead has ever made
such statements.
The Chronicle also refers me to Gen
eral Horace Porter's articles in the Cen
tury Magazine for proof of General
Grant's attitude toward war correspon
dents. I do- not need this reference, for I
am also safe In saying that Porter never
made any such statements as the Chroni
cle contained,
Will the Chronicle please producj them?
The Chronicle says triumphantly that
"it was expressly stated in recent tele
grams that the denial of a chance to
make names at the front in the Philip
pines was one of the grievances of the
signers of the round robin." Probably
recent telegrams did so state, but these
were Otis' telegrams.
The correspondents complained that I
they were not allowed to send the facts
because General Otis did not want the
people at home to be in possession of
them.
, These correspondents need no defense
from me. The people will decide between
their well tempered complaints. and Gen
eral Otis' censorship.
Nor dp I wish to. be misunderstood con- |
cerning General Sherman. He was the
Irreconcilable enemy .of all war corre- ,
spondents and never attempted conceal
ment of the fact.
General Grant treated all war corre
spondents fairly. The Chronicle's charges
against him in this regard are absolutely
untrue. My army acquaintance with him
antedates that of any person now living
so far as I know and was sufficiently
intimate to make me final authority in !
some particulars. General Porter and
General .lames Harrison Wilson, now
commanding the Departments of Ma
tanzas and Santa Clara. Cuba, will vouch
for this S. CADWALLADER.

in Judge Conlan's court yesterday, but ho
proved an absolute failuce, much to the
surprise of Prosecuting Attorney Low,
who had been notified of his proncivncy
in that particular line.
The case was that of J. Dalacucca. pro
prietor of a saloon and dance hall at r.^l
Montgomery avenue. He was accused of
permitting music to be played in his Dlaca

geant Christiansen and Policeman Duana
made the arrest and testilied that when
they entered the place about 2:30 o'ciocK
Monday morning they found several
couples duing a cakewalk to the music of
the piano.
Dalacucca testified in his own behaif
that several couples came to his placa
after he had locked up for the night, say

him some new tricks in eakewa'iking.

balked, returned to |he charge and asked
"What time wore they keeping?'

/SHOT HIMSELF WITH
A PAWNSHOP PISTOL
PATRICK H. CURRY, a boiler
maker in the employ of the Risdon

i> mined suicide in the pawnshop of
S. Goldstein. 231 Third street, yes
terday morning. Curry went into the
shop and on being handed a revolver
which lie asked for deliberately placed
the muzzle against his temple, tired the
revolver and fell to the tloor a corpse.
At first there was no clew to his iden
tity except the Initials "P. H. <â ..â¢' which
were tattooed on his arm. He was un
known to he owner pi the pawnshop and
was considerably under the Influence of
liquor when he committed the act. Pur
insr last evening a woman. Mrs. O. Kane.
who keeps a lodging-house at the corner
of Harrison and Fremont streets, called
at the Morgue and stated that she knew
the suicide. She threw an air of mystery
about The affair by refusing to divulge
either hÂ»r own or the name of the suicide.
On being ouestionod by Deputies Flan
nigan and La Combe, the woman said
that she would send the man's relatives
to the Coroner's office later and went
away. This last matter she failed to at
tend to. Last night about 11 o'clock, how
ever, other persons called at the Morgue
and gave not only the name of the de
ceased but that of the mysterious woman.
Curry was Jo -years of age and resided
with his wife and two sons at -412 Harri-
Eon street. He had been drinking consid
erably for the past few months and drink
is supposed to have been responsible for
his deed. r
Curry was first seen at the People's
Loan Office, at 668 Howard street, kept by
M. Harrison. He asked the clerk for a
six-shooter. He was handed a five
shooter, and he requested the clerk to put
In the cartridges.
"What do you want with the car
tridges?" asked the clerk: "you have not
even asked the price yet." The clerk
thereupon took the weapon out of the
man's hand, seeing that he was under the
influence of liquor, and the would-be pur
chaser went out of the shop.
The next place visited by the suicide
was the pawnshop of Mrs. A. Attell at 255
Third street. Charles Attell. a son of the
proprietor, waltf-d on him. but as Attell
had no cartridges the man went out. say-
Ing that he had no use for a pistol without
cartridges.

THE DEATH OF

! WAS IN PEARY'S EXPEDITION
ADMINISTRATION LETTERS ARE j
â¢ASKED BY HIS BROTHER.
' While Prospecting for Specimens on !
Greenland's Shores He Met
His Endâ Estates in
Probate.
I Within the next few days Judge Coffey
' will have proof of the death of John Me- i
| Kee Verhoeff. a member of the ill-fated
I Peary expedition, who, as far as can be
| ascertained, met his death in .the month ;
i of August, 1592, on -the bleak shores of
Greenland. Harry Verhoeff, a brother of
the dead explorer, yesterday made appli
cation for letters of administration upon
I his estate, which consists of personal ;
I property valued at $5000, the heirs being â¢
the petitioner and a sister. Martha Ver
hoeff. who resides In Louisville, Ky. He '.
' was a single man. and his parents pre- <
ceded him to the grave.
In the petition It is Bet forth that the i
dead explorer Was â â  m in Louisville. Ky..
| February IS, 1566. On January <;. 1891, he
i departed from New York City with the I
Peary expedition destined to explore the :
i region in the neighborhood of the north j
: pole. When near McCormick's Bay, in I
Greenland, he went ashore to prospect for 'â 
mineralogical specimens, ana was last
seen, on August 10, 1892, by Mr. Gibson, ;
! one of the members of the expedition, as \
Verhoeff was about to start on his pro
posed exploration, from which he never
returned; and though diligent search was
made no trace of him could be found. The
Peary expedition returned home, and the
following year Lieutenant Peary went
: again to the same region in Greenland
*and again searched for the deceased, but
: could find no trace or track of him. The
country in which he disappeared was un- !
inhabited and very cold, and there was
no place where the deceased could obtain
shelter or assistance. Lieutenant Peary
and his associates firmly believe that the
deceased lost his life shortly after ho j
was last Been' by Mr. Gibson. He has :
never been heard from since that date,
and seven years or more have passed :
since then, bo that there is but one con
clusion to reachâ that he gave up his life ;

It eve that the case should be reheard by
the Supreme Court in order to clear up
what may seem to many in the late deci
sion as a conflict with other well known
decisions. The main points in the petition
for a rehearing are summed up in the
concluding paragraph, which reads;
The charee of the trial court, an
given in this case, was well considered
by this court in the Cronin case, the
Morrow case, the Anthony case and
the Durrani case, hereinbefore cited.
and in view of the fact that .said
charge has stood so many years as <v:
mg the law of rhis State upon the
proposition and the further fact that
the point on which this case was re
â  â¢ rsed was not raised by appellants in
their brief herein, respondent never,
therefore, having been heard then.in.
we respectfully submit there are no
good reasons urged or given for tn^
overthrow of the principles laid down
in the instructions involved and that
a rehearing should be granted and the
judgment nf the lower court should be
affirmed.
Tii^ petition for rehearing will have to
be ruled upon before the 3lst of this

BEER WAS OVERWORKED
AND HAD COMPLAINED
TOLD THE DOCTOR THAT HE WAS
A GONER.
Witnesses Declared That His Death
Was the Result of an Accident
and' Was Not a Suicide.
.Coroner Hill held an Inquest yesterday
morning upon the body of Bernard Beer,
the San*ofrie-street commission merchant,
who was found la. Thursday morning
in the basement of his place of business
almost asphyxiated.
Louis Buchinam, the porter, testified that
he found the deceased lying unconscious
on a pile of banana leaves and the gas
escaping from the turned jet. Buchinani
did not rind the odor of gas very strong,
and he struck a match and lighted the
jet. Beer was removed to his home.
The widow of the deceased told how
Beer had recovered consciousness for a
moment and called her by name, but
was unable to say anything more. He
had not been despondent that she knew
of, and he surely would not have com
mittal suicide. A few nights before he
was 'found unconscious in his place of
business he complained that he was very
much worn out; that he was working
very hard. It had been his habit to leave
home about 3 o'clock every morning to
begin work at the store. He had never
threatened to commit suicide.
Dr. Charles Clark, the attending physi
cian, said that on Friday morning Beer
recovered consciousness and remarked
"that he was a goner," but made no state
ment as to whether his condition was due
to accident or design.
The jury returned a verdict of acci
dental death.

has been dull recently, but appears now to
be shaking oft its lethargy, and dealers are

down they generally amount to but very llt
t> R.^Cf-it sales, so far as can be determined,
have been limited to small lots, scarcely more
than two or three cars of any one variety.
â¢â¢Apricots are firmly held. 10 cents being the
ruling price on the coast in bags, with some
holders asking 10%gllc A lareer proportion,

but there seems to be a well-gr mnded opinion
that it Will be well up the rest r.f the s.-a-
Rnn It isn't so much a shortage of apri
cots as it is that shippers of green fruit and
canners have taken everything procurable,
leaving driers In some instances to search for
supplies.
P.aisiny continue steady. Mail advices from
California confirm, previous reports that the
crop Will be around 3000 cars. Estimates vary
- â  1700 cars to 3100 cars, but it is said that
a conservative statement is SOOO The carry
over will not be large, and opening prices are
paid to be contemplated 1 cent at least above

true or not remains to be determined.

at present are confined to small lots, scarcely

EASTERN MARKETS.
New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK. Auk. â A fierce conflict raged
all day to-day between opposing speculative in
terests on the Stock Exchange. The industrial
specialties were the chosen field of battle and
the" most violent contest raged about Brooklyn
Transit, as has been the case for many days
past. This stock showed evidence of support
at the opening of the stock market and got at
one time over a point above l*st night's closing
level.
In fare of this support and a rally in Inter
national Paper from its severe loss of yester
day the bears turned their attention to other
stocks which seemed for the moment to offer
a more vulnerable point of attack. Sugar drop
ped almost immediately 2Vi on account of the
cut of the price of relined sugar by the pom
-1 ...ny and the meeting of it by competing con
e -ms Steel and Wire Ir.st two points on the
â¢:(lure of the listing committee Of the Stock
Exchange tc art lavorably on the application
nf ihe company for the addition of the st... k
In Lhfl listed department of the exchange. Later
in the day Manhattan and Consolidated Gas
were added to the objective points of the bears.
All these stocks were so severely handled as
to check very materially the disposition to hnv
railroad stocks, which showed itself in con
tinued force during the early hours of the trad
ing Much has been hoped by thÂ« friends of
Brooklyn Transit from the publication of a
statement of the company's finances and esti- !
mates of earning power under the recent con
solidation. The statement, when published. ;
proved to be obscure and the estimates were :
so far from satisfactory that a perfect deluge '
of stocks for both accounts was poured upon
the market, carrying the price down by suc
cessive stages to "-* above par. an extreme droo >
of nearly six points. Only the must determined |
support checked the decline at that point, enor- ;
mous Individual blocks being taken before the I
rally was affected. The stock was lifted again |
to 102 T , and closed at 102 V The demoralization ]
In Brooklyn Transit was shared in lesser de- ]
grees by Sugar, which dropped an extreme Hi: |
Manhattan, which lost at one time nearly four j
points, and Steel and Wire common and pre- !
f erred; Federal Steel. People's Gas and Metro- ;
polltan Street Hallway, which declined from j
one to two points. The extreme weakness of J
the specialties was ignored for a time in the j
railroad list, where there were early advances !
in Denver and Rio Grande. Norfolk and West
ern, the Reading stocks, Baltimore and Ohio
and Wheeling and Lake Erie second preferred,
the latter rising over two points. The contin
ued nd violent decline in Brooklyn Transit
caused sympathetic depression throughout the |
market, "earlier gains being mostly wiped out j
and a number of standard railroad stocks, in- |
eluding the grangers, dropping a point or over
below last night's prices The rate for call
money rose to 4 per cent late in the day, prob
ably not without manipulation, but aulcklv
yielded to 3 per cent, near which It had ruled
all day. The final rally in Brooklyn. Transit
afforded relief to the whole market and losses
were partly retrieved, the most active special- |
ties recovering from one to two points.
There was a notable advance late in the day >
in the Norfolk and Western stocks, after the. ;
common had reacted a point with the general
list. These stocks show net gains of 2 5 , tor
the common and 1' , for the preferred. London

Chicago Grain Market.
â¦ Â»
CHICAGO, Auk. 22.â Some weakness was
shown at the opening In wheat. Both the
September and December options opened about
%c lower and showed a declining tendency.
j The weakness was not so much the result of
bear news as of the general apathy of trad
: Ing. Speculators appeared to be in the market
more from the sense of duty than from the
ho] of securing profits or saving losses and
the first half hour's trading was remarkably
small. Then a pronounced September liquidat
ing movement set In which lasted well into the
afternoon, and which resulted in widening the
spread between September and December op
tions to 2%c. A good deal of selling of Sep
tember was done by the Northwest, apparently
against liberal country receipts, .and though
; primary receipts continued to be smaller- than
those of last year, expectations of an Increase
had some effect on local speculators and
broadened the liquidation. Attention was also
directed to the relatively greater weakness of
" wheat at New York than here. There were
some bids for cash wheat here, but prices
were about Me out of line as â  rule, and little
business was done. During the afternoon the
tone of the market changed. September price
had been forced below put figures, and the
tendency to cover shorts was strengthened by
reports of renewed rains. in the Northwest and
by foreign advices that the drought in India
was worse than ever. September liquidation
censed and the market took on considerable
strength late in the session, resulting In a re
covery of nearly all the early loss. Brad
streets reports the world's visible decrease at
1,755,000 bushels. The seaboard late In the day
reported fifty-two loads for export. This
helped in the advance. September opened at
71%@71%0, declined to 70%e and reacted to
71VsÂ«V where it closed. December opened at
73V"""3 !ic. declined to 73Hc and reacted to and
Closed at 73v4c, an advance of %c.
Corn was weak and especially so for Sep
tember, In which there was a good deal of im
port liquidation. Klevator people and receiving
houses generally were sellers. September
closed %c lower and December unchanged.
| OAts were firm considering the ' decline In
other grain markets and the unfavorable con
ditions affecting oats. Trading was narrow all
day. September closed a shade higher.
Provisions were extremely dull and prices
changed but little The tendency during most
of the session was downward, the result of
lower ho prices. There was a moderate ,
amount of September liquidation done. |
Prices firmed up during the afternoon, the
market closed steady for pork and lard and a
little easier for ribs. At the close September
pork was a shade higher, lard a shade higher
and ribs a shade lower.

The damage to the grain crop of the Willa
mette Valley by the heavy rains which have
prevailed for the past ten days Is estimated at
nearly 50 Â£>er cent. Much of the wheat in the
shock has commenced to sprout and the grain
Which Is not yet cut is lodged so badly that a
large portion of it will be lost.
In Washington and Oregon, east of the Cas
cades, the rains have not been so heavy as on
the west side, and consequently damage to
Brain has not been fh great. Wheat buyers
will not make quotations on new wheat.

the absence of speculative demand the bears
retained their advantage, and there were more
sellers than buyers. The weather was favor
able and the movement was small. Export
bids were 1c under the market. There was a
better inquiry for export, however, and 32
boatloads were taken at the seaboard. Too
much rain was reported in the Southwest.

.â¦ as I have been giving you he jt

Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
90S Broadway. Aug. 22.
The above- is but an excerpt fro"m the
highly Inflammable testimony adduced at
the trial of the divorce suit of Ernest
C, Mueller, which was concluded in
Superior Judge Ellsworth's court this
afternoon. A decree of divorce was im
mediately granted on the strength of the
plaintiff husbar.d's testimony, for Mrs.
Mueller did not appear in court to gain
say the husband's statements or contest
the 3uit.
The parties were married about eight
years ago, and along in IS?6. according
to Mueller's testimony, the wife's un
governable temper and extreme jealousy
developed into an unbearable quantity
and quality. On one occasion, after the
truly crushed husband had tried to ap
rease his iritable spouse, she rolled off in
stentorian and angry tones the .exclama
tion quoted above, in reply to which
Mueller simply said thp.t "You know that
1 was not brought up that way, Sadie, to
strike a woman."
On another occasion, in November. 1^56,
after the henpecked man had gotten
breakfast ready, their little 3-year-old
child cried for hunger, and when the hus
band asked the wire to arise she harshly
replied In terms signifying her indif
ference to the child taking residence with
his satanic majesty.
Frequently the wife would lock Mueller
out, so he "testified, and accuse : m of
consorting with other women, and on one
occasion of her suspicion she threw the
husband out of the house bodily and lock
ed the door, calling after him to send an
expressman for his wardrobe. This he
finally did, and went to live with his
parents.
But the woman next became his veri
table Nemesis and called frequently at
his jewelry store, demanding money for
her support. To keep her from creating
a scene he promised to present her with
a set of diamond earrings for Christmas
if she'd be good, and she consented, and
a reconciliation followed, lasting until
the day of the promised delivery of the
earrings, when another quarrel arose, and
according to Mueller. "Sadie threatened
to put prison in my coffee." When he
appÂ«?ajingly doubted her threat she had
replied that "others have done it and I
can do it There are other ways of doing
it too. I can wait until you get asleep
and run a hatpin through your ribs."
Once more Mueller, almost driven in
sane, took his clothes and went for good.
The divorce suit and fÂ»?cree are the
sc-quel. When the decr-#.- was handed
down to-day Mueller volunteered to pay
his ex-wife $10 monthly for the support of
their child, the custody of whom was
awarded the mother.
HIS WILL EXEMPLIFIES
HIS TRUE SIMPLICITY
7. West Martin Leaves All to His
Widow and Asks No Admin
istration Be Had.
OAKLAND. Aug. 22.â The will of the
late J. West Martin was filed for probate

out intervention from any source, having
implicit conridc-nce in her sense of right
and justice to do what she believes to be
right with reference to our children
Thomas EÂ»avis Carneal, Richard Winter
Martin and Shelby Foote Martin. For
that reason I have not made them benefl
riariesin this â well, and to more fully give
repression to my wishes in regard tc
them I hereby enjoin upon her that she
-hall without delay, at as early a day
is possible, make her will, disposing ol
ier property so left by me as to her may
seem best, and such disposition shall be
Wmed final and conclusive." Richard
Martin, named in the will, died about
wo years ago.

SHE OBJECTS TO THE
NICHOLSES' COLD STARE
OAKLAND, Aug. 22.â Miss Jane Hodge,
the aster plaintiff in the $50,000 breach
of-promise damage suit against John
Nichol, the aged millionaire, will have to
give her deposition next Saturday, no
matter whether relatives of defendant are
present staring at ncr or not. Judge Og

the premises. "You might as well say
that ' the plaintiff refused to testify. '
mused his Honor, "because witness' chair
did not face the north star, or because
It was the wrong time of the month and
the moon had not reached the proper
P When Miss Hodge started to give her
deposition last Saturday she objected to
continue, under advice from her attor
neys Nusbaumer & Reed, because rela
tives of the aged millionaire she claims
once loved her till her cheeks burned,
w*re present. Attorney Mhoon, on behalf
of defendant,, insisted that the relatives
had a right toÂ«ittend on the occasion, when
Miss Hodge suddenly and blushingly ter
minated the deposition by hurrying from
the scene. It was decided to submit the
matter to Judge Ogden, who now rules
that the presence of the relatives is not
legally objectionable.

WHO FALLS FARTHEST
GETS LEAST INJURIES
OAKLAND, Aug. 22.â The distance a
man falls is by no means a criterion
whereby to speculate as to the injuries
likely to be sustained. This morning John
Cohen, a painter, aged 45 years, and re
siding on Alcatraz avenue, fell from tho
roof of a house on Railroad avenue by
reason of a painter's Jack slipping, and
when he was picked up, a distance of
twenty-five feet below, it was found that
his injuries consisted of a sprained ankle.
lacerated wound on the left eyebrow at:d
a contused wound on the right side of the
face and head, for which Steward Borchert
treated him at the Receiving Hospital.
About the same time L. M. Gardener, a
carpenter, aged 45 years, and residing in
San Francisco, fell from a stepladdrr
while working at Thirty-eighth street and
Telegraph avenue. He fell but throe feet
and sustained a fractured collarbone,
which Dr. Row- attended to for him at

THE SAN FBANCISCO CALL. WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 23, 1899.
IMPLORES HIS
SECOND WIFE
TO BE LENIENT
Charles Wolf's First
Spouse Rejoices.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Aug. 22.
Charles L. Wolfs cup of despair ran
over to-day as he sat in his cell and heard
that his first wife had written to me Dis
trict Attorney and had offered to supply
ail the evidence necessary to convict her
husband of bigamy. Mrs. Wolf No. 1 of
Delaware cannot testify against her hus
band, but she sends marriage records; and
as Wolf has no divorce Mrs. Wolf No. 2
will do the rest.
Mrs. Wolf No. 2 received a letter this
morning from her predecessor in Wolf's
affections. The writer expresses the
greatest satisfaction that the man who
deserted her and three children is In
prison, and says that she will forward the
necessary evidence as soon as possible to
prove that she Is still Wolf's wife. The
evidence of his second marriage is al
ready before the court. Miss Mattie
ryrce, the woman with whom Wolf eloped
to Tesla. has not assisted him since he
was taken from the cabin at Tesla by a
constable. Wolf has made an earnest ap
peal to his second wife not to have him
sent to jail, but she has declined to Inter
fere with the course of the law. Wolf
has asked her to call on him at the jail,
but she has also declined to accede to this
request.
wolf thoroughly realizes that he can do
but little, now that he is pursued by two
scorned, deserted wives, and his sole anx
iety Is regarding the length of sentence
eenerally given in such cases.
"I do not see what business it is of any
s if I have twenty wives." said
Wi.if. "My wives are my own business,
and I do not want people to interfere in
mv affairs.'
ABDUCTION OF A
CHINESE GIRL
mere were some umooKea-ror aeveiop
ments in Judge Treadwell's court yester
day afternoon In the case of Wong Suey,
charged with kidnaping Ah Moy. alias
â¢ 'hoy Long, on June 12 last from a restau
rant on Pacific street and taking her in
a hack to Holy Cross Cemetery, where
she was carried away by two older Chi
nese and mysteriously disappeared.
John J. Kerrigan, the hackman who
drove the party to the cemetery, and
Wong Suey were arrested early that
morning while returning from the ceme
tery, but about two weeks ago the case
against Kerrigan was dismissed.-
When the case was , called yesterday
Leong Sun. a sister of Ah Moy. testified
that Ah Moy had been invited to a ban
quet by Ah Chuck on the night of June
12, and that was the last seen of her.
Attorney McKlnlay, who represented the
defendant, said he could produce the girl
in ten minutes, and a recess was taken.
At the expiration of ten minutes Ah Moy
was brought into court, and she testified
that she had been married to Wong Chuck
King, who is supposed to be Ah Chuck,
her ' abductor, by Justice or" the Peace
Cook last Saturday.
The prosecution claimed that the mar
riage had taker, place to save Ah Chuck
from being proceeded against for kidnap
ing, and Judge Treadwell concurred In
that opinion. Kerrigan, the hackman,
had been subpenaed as a witness for the
prosecution, but when placed on the stand
his answers to the questions were so con
tradictory that the Judge ordered him into
custody, md also ordered Ah Moy into
custody, as he was determined to make
a thorough Investigation into the case.
The girl was kept in hiding in Santa
Clara County after her abduction, and the
police allege that Fung Fat. her previous
owner, finally offered a reward of $1050
for her return, and that is the reason why
she was able to be produced In court yes
terday. The question is. whd got the
11060?
ACKNOWLEDGED AS HIS SON.
Witnesses Testify That Captain Hall
Assumed That Relation Toward
Rulofson.
The case of Alfred C. Rulofson, insti
tuted to recover the fortune left by the
Captain WTnslow G. Hall, pains
stn n<rth daily. Mr. Rulofson alleges that
he is tho Legally adopted son of th" d< -
ceased capitalist and is daily presenting
â r-.ofs before Judge Belcher. The
â x.'imi nation of H. E. "^'illhims was
comj'. terday, but his story re
mained as told on oripinal examination.
Edward Bryans, who was employed by
th*- Russell &â  Krwin Manufacturing Com
pany with Rulofson during thÂ« ra i
and IS7I and subsequently entered the em
ploy â â :' Baker & Hamilton with Mr. Ru
lofson, testified that from 1871 to 189? Cap
â  â¢ tatty called at the store
and took Rulofson to dinner with him.
The witness s.d<i that Captain Hall's ln
â¢ In Rulofi -I'd that of the
rs of the other employes and he al
ways understood that the relation of
â  and son existed between them. W.
}i. Rulofson, the claimant's natural
father, never calK-d. he said, and Captain
fulfilled his dutios as the claimant's
adopted parent. Samuel Platt. who was
connected with the Russet] & Krwin
ifacturing Company, testified that
.:! Hall daily visited Rulofson and
it was well known that the relation of
father and son existed between them.
David Rodrtck testified that Hall and
Rulofson often came to his barber-shop
together, and in answer to a question
Captain Hall ?:iid that Rulofson was his
adopted son. Mrs. E. B. Spencer of Santa
Crux Bald that while Miss Abbott, now
Mr. > - wife, was staying with
her Captain Hall called, and knowing that
Mr. Rulofson and Miss Abbott were to be
married, said that he objected to the cere
mony being performed at that time, as
Rulofson was not yet of age. He said
that his Interest in Rulofson was that of
a father, as he had assumed that relation,
and henceforth it was understood that
Hall was Rulofson'B adopted father. Mrs.
er*a testimony was Included in a
itlon. and after it had been read the
case went over.

WORKED FOR BOTH SIDES.
Peculiar Conduct of an Officer of the
Eureka Society for the Preven
tion of Cruelty to Children.
John F. Curran, a stevedore, appeared
before Judge Treadwell yesterday on a j
charge of failure to provide for his chil
dren. During the hearing a peculiar state
of affairs was disclosed.
The complaint was sworn to last April
by E. L. Wadham. then secretary and i
now special officer of the Eureka Society
for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children.
The case had been continued from time
to time, as Curran had agreed to nay a
certain sum for the support of his wife i
and children. When the case was called
yesterday Wadham appeared in support
â¢ â  husband, much to the surprise of
tho court.
Curran wore patent leather shoes and
had a diamond ring on his finger and n
diamond i?tud in his shirt front. Mrs.
Curran was in rags, and her 12-year -old .
bnv was in a similar condition. WadbaiD
thought that $2 50 per week was enough j
â¢ I'port the wife and children, md !
when the Judge asked him why he ut J
first appeared as prosecutor against tho
husband and now defended him he re
plied that he thought tho wife had been
getting enough money from Curran. The
Judge denounced Wadham for his poci;- i
liar conduct and asked Curran why he
did not pawn his diamonds to support hlÂ»
family. Curran laughed and the Judge !
ordered him into custody, fixing hie bonds
in $WOO.
Later in the day a writ of habeas corpus
v;as applied for in the Superior Court to
. Curran's release.
E. L. Wadham says that the warrant in
the case was served by tne California So
ciety for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Children.
Accused of Stealing Palms.
E. L. Foster, the janitor at Bushnell'B j
photographic gallery, who was arrested j
Monday night for stealing palmÂ» from j
the sidewalk, appeared in Judge Gra
ham's court yesterday. It was stated
that a private decorator had been en
gaged by Bushnell to decorate his gal
lery, and Foster imagined that the palms
belonged to the decorator and was stor
ing them in the cellar when arrested. The
Judge gave him the benefit of the doubt
and dismissed the case. The cases against
i 'â â  rge Murphy and E. J. Ford, who were
arrested on a similar charge, were dis
missed by Judge Conlan. as they had
simply picked up a palm after the deco
rators had finished their work.

Ingersoll Memorial.
Pr. J. L. York delivered an impressive
eulogy Â°n Robert G. Ingersoll at Scottish
Hull Mondaynight before a. large audience.
In the course of his remarks he scored the
churches for what he considered unjust
criticism and comment on the personal
character and name of the dead agnostic,
and said that the verdict of the world had
been recorded In his favor as a brave soul,
faithful and true to his convictions of
right and truth, and a man whose forty
years of public life had done more to help
the world than many of those who now
criticise him. Other features of the pro
gramme were addresses by Hart Bouton

FISHERMEN NOT TO
BE PROSECUTED
Alleeed Canadian Poachers in Amer-
ican Waters Will Not Be Pro
ceeded Against.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 22.â Assistant
Secretary Vanderlip to-day instructed the
Collector of Customs at Port Townsend
not to institute proceedings against the
several Canadian fishing vessels seized
last month near Port Roberts for fishing,
as alleged, in American waters. The in
structions were based on a careful inves
tigation by the United States District At
torney, who reported that in this instance
he was satisfied the fishermen were not
poachers in American waters.
The British Embassy also presented
evidence in support of this view of the
case. The instructions are not to be con
sidered a precedent, however, and cus
toms officers will be expected to enforce
the provision which forfeits a foreign ves
sel caught fishing In American waters.
Mr. Vanderlip has also taken measures
with a view, if feasible, of having the
limits of American waters in the Gulf of
Georgia more clearly indicated by buoys
and beacons.

as the boys were tired with playing at the
dance on Friday evening. This was a

I notified the contractors engaged in erect
ing the foundation of the San Francisco
: Postoffice building that they may
' substitute Kyune, Utah, sandstone for
: facings instead of the stone originally
â  contracted for. It has been substantiated
I to the satisfaction of the department by
I the contractors that the stone they
originally contemplated using In this
work cannot be obtained, owing to the
I exhaustion of the quarry from which it
was procured. It has therefore been dt>
t-rmfned to use Utah sandstone, but the
change will cost the contract >r~ P865.
This change will in no way mar the

DOCKING OF SHAMROCK.
This Will Be Delayed Until Just Be
fore She Is Measured.
NEW YORK. Aug. 22.-The yacht
Shamrock lies alongside Erie basin pier
to-nigiit, completely stripped of all nor
seagoing spars and rigging, and wild
everything taken out from below. She
rnw floats fully eighteen inches hiehor
than she did upon her arrival last Friday
morning.
During the afternoon a number of hags
of sand were passed up from the Sham
rock's hold and put on board the t* nder
Xonomantuck. It is said they were used
in the bilges and other parts of the yacht
as ballast.
The Shamrock is not to be drydocked
until the arrival of Sir Thomas Upton,
and perhaps not then, for her captain
says it is not necessary to haul her out
until the time set for measuring her just
before the races. The Shamrock is to
receive her racing rig at once.

Only One Day Left to Cite the
Counties.
SACRAMENTO. Aug. 22.â The State
Board of Equalization must act to-mor
row if any counties are to be cited to

another to-day, fach waiting for pom" one
else to start the thing by moving that
some county be cited, but the Ice v.

Dead on the Beach.
SANTA BARBARA. Aug. IIâ H. A. Hol
lister, while riding along the beach near
Point Conception, yesterday morning dis
covered a man lying on his side, with the
waves gently rolling over him. By his sido
lay a half-empty whisky bottle. He ap
peared to have been dead some time, and
no signs of foul play were evident. He
nged to one of the railroad construc
tion camps near by. and was taken there
and identified. It was thought that in a
drunken condition he fell in the sand an.l
sleep overtook him and as the tide began
to rise and cover him he was drowned.
Strikers Confident.
LOS ANGELES. Aug. 22.â There has
been no change in the plumbers' strike
during the past few days. The men are
taking things easily, and quietly waiting
for the work In the two shops that are
holding out. The journeymen believe
that these shops will accumulate work to
such an extent that the employers will
be compelled to take the old employes
back or at least have union men at the
regular scale of 43 50 per day. The strik
ers and their former employers are on
the best of terms? and so far there has
not been the slightest trouble.

KINDERGARTENS
ARE REOPENED
School War Goes Merrily
On in San Jose.
â¢!al Dispatch to The Call.
BAN JOSE. Aug. 23.â The kindergar
tens of this city have been re-estab
lished by the City Board of Education.
For the past year they have been closed
and reopened several times, and great
dissatisfaction has arisen over this
spasmodic work Of the .School Trustees.
The juggling of the city schools has
done irreparable injury to the city and
at the same time mulcted the taxpay
ers to the tune of several thousand dol
lars. Most of the acts of the Trustees
have proved boomerangs and they have
been obliged to swallow a bitter dose In
many instances.
Miss Fannie Stockton, who was dis
missed from the schools a year ago,
after four months of idleness, succeeded
in being reinstated when she threatened
suit, and a month ago the Board of
Education secretly allowed her over
$200 salary f<>r the time she was out
of the schools. She had performed no
labor at all for this money, but there
was jio compunction on the part of the
Trustees in giving her the taxpayers'
money.
Miss Kittle McGinley is another
teacher who has won out on the Board
of Education. Shp was dismissed from
the kindergarten without cause. BiiÃfl
McGinley took the matter to th^ Su
perior Court and obtained a. judgment
for three months' salary. Hie matter
has been appealed to the Supreme
Court, but she will probably get a
judgment. Last night the Trustees re
instated Miss McGinley. â¢
Mrs. A. B. Clement is about the only
unfortunate one. Rea had her removed
from the office of Assistant Superin
tendent of City Schools. stv> obtained a
place in the Normal, but the gang,
through McNaughton. had her dis
missed. Trustees Wemple and O'N'eil
tried last night to reinstate her as As
sistant City Superintendent, but did not
succeed.
Ten kindergarten classes have been
established â two in each ward and two
in Cottage Grove. Formerly there were
sixteen, with Mi?? Belle Mackenzie as
supervisor. The teachers selected for
the kindergartens are: Eva Mackenzie,
Kate Slnnott, Almedia McMillan. Alice
Bassler. Mrs. Ella Graham. Agnes Hal
sey, Hattie Hoffman. Annie Cavallaro,
Annie Stockton and Kit'ie McGinley.
Miss Susie Gallimore has been elect
ed Assistant City Superintendent of
Schools. H. McKenna was appointed
teacher in the night school. Joseph P.
Hancock was elected principal of the
Horace Mann School and E. E. Brow
nell of Mountain View a teacher in the
High School. These iast two appoint
ments were at Rea's Hirection.
Misses Annie Carroll and Carrie TVil
liams have been elected regular teach
ers.
E. K. Robinson. Kate O'Neill, Mrs.
Mary McDonald. Annie Leddy and Mrs.
Taylor will preside as janitors in the
kindergartens.
Wednesday night the classification
committee, which is the teachers' bug
aboo, reports. Until then the various
teachers will be hard at work with their
"influences."
ASSAULTED A CHILD
Human Fiend Is Nearly Lynched by
an Enraged Crowd.
FALLS CITY. Nebr.. Aug. 22.â A man
known as "Shorty" Wilson, a compara
tive stranger, committed an assault this
evening on the seven-year-old daughter
of A. W. Burchard. a prominent merchant
of this city. The assailant gagged his
victim with a corncoh. The child gave
the alarm and Wilson was found in a sa
loon, where he was arrnsted. or, the way
to the jail a crowd, headed by the child's
father got after Wilson with a rope, and
it was' with the utmost difficulty that the
Sheriff got his man behind the bars. The
crowd is still hanging around the jail and
a lynching ia not improbable.

to appoint a committee on order of busi
â¢ i was readily found and
the motion was unanimously carried.
Andrew Maguire moved the appoint
ment oi a committee of fifteen on plat
form and resolutions, but BertSchlesinger
particularly desired a representative from
cadi district "i! this committee, and ins
amendment to make it eighteen was
carried, one for each district.
The appointment of the committee for
the selection of Supervisors indicated the
warm fight that was t<> follow the ap
pointment of representatives to the
county c.immitu-.'. Thf original mi
w.i^ for the lucky number seven, but a!
batch of amendments followed In quirk
succession, scum- for eighteen members,
and one for as many as thirty-six. The
original number was '. rally sÂ« lected.
ThÂ« i.rlit of the evening which pro
voked tin- true spirit of Democracy and
consumed a full hour of time was
the discussion of appointment of repre
â¢ itlves to the county committ*-. .
P. H. McCarthy introduced the following
resolution:
R â lved, That the Democratic County Com
ot the Cits and County ot San Frai
shall consist of 112 members four members
forthwith by th<
In this convention from every Assembly
â¢ and the remainder to be appointed at
large by the chairman of this convention. Va
urring in the County Committee
after its selection hall be Blled by the re
maining menil"-rs thereof.
That started the ball rolling. William
E. White objected to this Bystem of ap
portionment and he proposed a represen
tation based upon the primary vote at
the last election. Columns <>f numbers
were presented and the discussion waxed
hot over the distinct claims of each dia
trict for representation. When the con
vention work<d its spirit out on this
amendment P. J. Haggerty felt in duty
bound to suggest another, and h>- was for
the appointment "f five members from
each district and eighteen others to be
selected by the chair. The amendment
to the amendment died a Tii<-k death
when a vote was called, and the amend
ment met the same fate as the first. Mc-
Carthy's original motion was carried.
A recess was suggested by Chairman
McDonald, but before this could !>â¢â  peai â¢ -
ably allowed the following resolution was
adopted: '
Kesolved, That this Demo<-ratin loral O n
vention appoint a committee Tiii.Â»i=tlnK
man fr :n each of the eightwn Assembly rllH
tricts to art In conjunction with the Red Cross
and employment committee to a.i<l in securing
employment for the sun Francisco boys, and
also aid In having soldiers from other ritips re
turned to their homes.
The following are tho committee, in the
order of districts, from the Twenty-eighth
to the Forty-fifth:
William A. Pcake, James J. Farrell,
Robert Gough, John F. Rennault, E. J.

Leland.
A fifteen minutes' recess Rave the chair
men of districts an opportunity to enter
the names of the four appointees to the
County Committee. Everything pro
gressed smoothly upon the reassemblage
of the convention until the Forty-third
District was reached. The Forty-third
had not filed the names of the four com
mitteemen, and when the district was
i called in regular order a war of words
was introduced upon the scene. William
K. McCarthy, chairman of the Forty
' third, arose and attempted to tell the
convention that the delegates had not had
an opportunity to reach an understanding.
! This wa-s martial food for J. J. Fagan of
the Bame district, and he claimed long
and vociferously that an agreement had
been reached. For a time it looked as if |
a fight was about to break out. but Chair- I
man McDonald passed the district after a
motion to Investigate the contention had
been lost.
In the reading of the eommitteem<Â»n .in
objection was t.ik'-n to the name of
; Thomas O'Neill. This matter as well .'i*
the tangle in the Forty-third waa put
over. All names entered were declared
members of the County Committee, md
it was suggested that the other districts
decide and send in their names. The
Forty-third finally worked its way out of
the tangle and agreed on the four ni"m
bers. The Thirty-fifth fell in line and the
four names originally read were agreed
upon.
The convention then adjourned to be
reconvened at the call of the chair.

REPUBLICAN CAUCUS.
Independents Protest Against
the Action of the Central
League.
A number of Independent delegates to
the Republican municipal convention met
in executive session in Concord Hall, A.
O F. building, 102 O'Farrell street, last
night. The meeting was called to order
by A. Ruef, who represented the dele
gates of the Forty-fourth Assembly Dis
trict who had won out at the late pri
mary against the combined ticket of
Crimmins and Kelly and the Citizens' Re
publican faction.
The object of the meeting was to ex
press indignation and take action on the
result of the caucus held by the citizens'
Republican League at cne Grand Hotel,
where, it is claimed by the independents
who voted with the caucus, that their
vote? were obtained by fraudulent mis
representation of clever politicians, who
t'.ok advantage of the inexperience of the
Independents. The selecting of the Coun
ty 1 "oinmittee by the citizens' League
from the districts where the Independents
have won Is also objected to, as it shuts
them out entirely so far as representation
in the County Committee is concerned.
The meeting last night represented, it is
claimed, eleven Assembly Districts and
was addressed by John F. English, A.
Ruef. F. P. Haynes. M. Cerf, Robert C.
Kelly, E. D. Feusler. A. W. Llechti. .1.
X Newford, A. Lewald, G. .1. Raychester
and others. It was finally decided that a
committee be appointed from each dis
trlct represented as an advisory commit
tee to consider the besi course tn pursue
io act in concert with the other delegates.
The independents claim that they repre
sent enough votes to prevent any faction
from "owning" the convention
The delegates of the Thirty-sixth As
sembly District who "walked out" of the
Grand Hotel caucus last Saturday night
reported to their district club at Hart
ford Hall, on Hartford street near Eight
eenth, last night. After hearing their re
pori the district club commended the
action taken by their delegates and
tendered them a vote of confidence. An
Invitation was received from L. 1.. Solo
mon of the citizens' Republican League
by the delegates to return to the fold,
where their opinion would be received.
The meeting adjourned without taking
action on the invitation.

CRISIS NOW REACHED IN
THE QUARANTINE WAR
This Will Force the State to Appeal to the
Courts for an Amicable Settlement
of the Matter.
THE war between the Federal and
the State quarantine departments
which has been going on for sev
eral months, to the injury of the
city, received a check yesterday
by the dedided action of Customs Sur
veyor Spear, who instructed his in
spectors on board the Doric to prevent

FINIGAN'S FACE
WAS NOT GOOD
FOR HIS BOARD
Asked to Leave the
Hotel Rafael.
Colonel Peter A. Finlgan, the legal pau
per of the Hot< 1 Rafael, Is out 'in the cold
world. He and his three daughters have
been "fired" out of the hostelry because
no more money was forthcoming nnd
General Warfleld cannot run his house on
promises.
Finigan, tip to his involuntary exit on
Monday, held a most peculiar position in
the world of hotel people. He was living
at the swellest place in tin- suburb and at
the same time he managed to prove in
court that he had not a cent. He waa
not ejected from the house, either, or at
least not as early as that, and there was
nothing money could buy that Finigan
denied himself. He came to the hotel
from a cell in prison, which he had been
occupying because he would not pay his
ex- wife the alimony a court had allowed
her.
Finigan's plea in extenuation of his fail
ure to pay the alimony was that he had
not the money; that be was in every
Bense a pauper. The court sized up the
evidences of wealth with which Finigan
was surrounding himself and thought
otherwise, so Finigan was sent to jail
until such time as he was willing to put
up the money allowed his wife. He was
stubborn and remained In jail, and while
he dined upon the fat of the land he still
declared he was penniless and linally he
convince d the court.
He was allowed to leave the jail as a
pauper am! he went from the jail to th"
Hotel Rafael, where he lived for three
years with his daughters. He has paid
money to Genera] warfleld at times, but
in ver very much. â never enough to lay
him liable to the charge >>f pet-Jury for
swearing he was a pauper. His daugh
ters had snni' 1 property in Berkeley ami
this they mortgaged to General Warfleld,
and upon that they lived ai the hotel in
tti.- best of style. ' Hut the value of the
mortgage had been used up. and no other
funds "i- mortgages were forthcoming.
Genera] Warfleld wanted the Finigan bills
kept straight, but Finigan could not put
up any money, for as soon as he did the
the Falsity of his paupers-hip plea would
become evident and the jail would yawn
for him again, and perhaps after all he
would 1m- compelled t<> put up the ali
mony. It was a delicate position for a
sensitive gentleman to be placed in, but
Firigan Stood It as long as he could. In
fact, it was Warfield who made the first
move. Finigan and his daughters made
the second, it was one to Berkeley, Where
Finigan is going t'> try tn live up to his
means again without belying the oath
that let him out of Jail. It is a problem
in finances that might be made profitable
if he can tind some unsuspecting hotel
man to help him work It out.
HARVARD CLUB HONORS
PROFESSOR A. AGASSIZ
WISHES HIM BON VOYAGE AT A
MAGNIFICENT BANQUET.
He Goes to Explore the Depths of the
South Pacific in the Interests of
Scientific Education.
Professor ..gasslz, the distinguished
scientist, was the guest of honor at a
dinner of the Harvard Club of California,
held Monday night in the banquet-room of
Delmonico's. Over sixty members sat
down to an excellent menu that had been
prepared for their entertainment, and not
a thing was lacking either in the compo
sition of the dinner, the service or the
conviviality of the men who ate it. which
would help to make it a perfect success.
When the physical man had been suffi
ciently pacified to listen patiently Presi
dent Sam Biglow arose and in a bright,
well delivered speech Introduced the guest
of the evening to those of the members
to whom he was not already known. Pro
fessor Agassiz in .his reply outlined the
object of his visit to the coast, which is
as follows: He will sail this morning
on the Pish Commission's vessel Alba
tross for an extended tour of the waters
surrounding the islands of the South
Pacific and those washing the coasts of
China and Japan. He will make the
most exhaustive researches of the
ocean's depths where they have not . al
ready been overhauled by the famous
Challenger expedition, which was sent
out some years ago by the English Gov
ernment. Professor Agassiz thinks that,
owing to -he limited facilities enjoyed by
the directors of that expedition, there will
be found by him much that is new and
which will Jje of great interest to the
scientific world. There is one spot alone,
off the Japanese coast, over 6700 fathoms
in depth, which has never been sounded
and which the. professor, with the Instru
ments which he will take with him, will
be able to thoroughly explore. The voy
age Is expected to last. over six months
at least, and at Its conclusion Professor
Agassiz will give to the world the result
of his explorations in a volume which
should be widely sought after by those in
terested in such matters. Professor
Agassiz is staying at the Palace, where
he arrived Sunday evening.
Following â¢ Professor Agassiz, Horace
Davis, J. \v. Taylor and a number of
others spoke, after which an election was
held, at which T. W. Hunflngton of this
city, W. D. M. Howard of San Mateo and
held that the Federal statutes and cus
toms regulations do not recognize the
State quarantine officials and that they
should be treated as private persons. In
pursuance of this order, the customs In
spectors in charge of the Doric informed
Dr. Cobn that he would not be allowed
to come on board until after the steamer
had been allowed free pratique by the
Federal Quarantine Otlio-r.
Dr. C'ohn protested, but in a mild way,
and contented himself with taking down
the names of the customs inspectors with
a view to legal proceedings. Hereafter,
if no order of court intervenes to the con
trary, no State quarantine officer will be
allowed to board an incoming vessel be
fore she has been granted free pratique
by the Federal Quarantine Officer.
"it is probable that the State authorities
will appeal to the courts and that the
unseemly wrangling will be brought to a
speedy end.
Customs Surveyor Spear relies upon the
following section's in the Revised Statutes
of the' United States:
No person, except pilots, customs and health
officers, I'onsuls and asents of the vessel, shall
be permitted to come on board or leave a ves
sel without permission of the customs officer In
charge until all the passengers and their bag
ifage shall have been duly landed.
No pilot or other person will be allowed to
leave a vessel until the vessel shall have been
inspected by the quarantine officer, and any
person violating this requirement shall be re
ported to the nearest United States Attorney
for prosecution. No person will be allowed to
leave the quarantine reservation or a vessel
placed in quarantine without permission of the
quarantine officer.
Mr. Spear contends that as the forego
ing provisions of the United States
statutes were made for the government
of Federal matters, the health officers
mentioned are the Federal health officers
and that no other health officials are rec
ognized.
(.'. C. Bull of Belmont and a Rough
Rider of fame, were admitted to member
ship.
In regard to the Agassiz expedition it is
said that much of the expense attendant
thereon will be born by the gentleman
himself, who is well possessed of this
world's goods, as the $800,000 he has al
ready donated to Harvard at various
times and in various ways bear testi
mony.

DEATH OF MRS. HITCHCOCK.
One of California's Best - Known
Women Passes Away at the
Palace Hotel.
Mr?. Martha Hitchcock died at the
Palace Hotel last evening- after a very
short illness. Mrs. Hitchcock was one of
the best known of the pioneer women <'f
the State. Srie was the widow of Dr. 11.
C. Hitchcock, who was formerly head of
the Army Medical Department on this
coasi and who died here in I^~>. The fam
ily of the Hitchcocka come from Georgia,
where the deceased was born and where
she waa married to L'r. Hitchcock, who
was at that time a young army surgeon.
Some time after their marriage Dr. Hitch
cock was ordered out to thkj city t.> as
sume charge of the Medical Department
of California. 'He remained here in that
position for several years, when he re
signed and entered upon a private prac
tice, at which he amassed an immense
fortune, which he left to his widow when
he died.
Mrs. Hitchcock was eighty-two years
of age at the time of her death. Some
time aX" she took a trip to Paris, and
ever since her return she had been ail
ing, though not in a state of health that
gave any apparent cause for alarm; con
sequently her death was a great shock
to her relatives and friends.
The decease, l leaves i>nc daughter, Mrs.
Lillian Colt, the widow of Howard Colt,
who was for many years caller of the
San Francisco Stock Exchange when that
institution was Beeing its palmiest days.
He died in 1886, the same year that witn
essed the demise of his father-in-law.
Mrs. Colt is known to every old-timer
in the city as Llllie Hitchcock, who was
a member of Volunteer Fire Company
Xo. â¢"â  and who used to run with the old
"maehin' " whenever the boys were called
out.
As yet no definite arrangements have
been made for the funeral.

: I with serious thought, bold assertions and
pertinent suggestions. In his opening
â¢ words the speaker was very happy in his
complimentary and encouraging sayings
â¢ to the new doctors, and was full of his
characteristic eloquence: He eulogized
Cooper College and its faculty, and be
i cause these learned professors had pro
' nounced the graduates competent, so, he
â  said, society might fully trust the grad
i uates.
Hut Rabbi Voorsanger had something
more serious to say to both graduates and
audience. He warned them that, with the
â  spread of general education, the profes
. sions are filling too rapidly and the stand
ards are lowering. He charged that the
sin of commercialism had entered the
ranks of the learned professions and that
I the doctor, the lawyer and the professor
were In danger of degenerating to mere
fee-earners. With solemnity the rabbi ad
jured his young friends to keep their
standards lofty* to protect the sanctity of
their professional Ideals, to remember
'â  that while the practitioner earned and de- â 
i served his pay, yet his life must be de
voted to the far loftier duty of ameliorat
ing the suffering of humanity.
The rabbi's address created a profound
impression and was full of fire to the very
close. Following is the list of graduates:
