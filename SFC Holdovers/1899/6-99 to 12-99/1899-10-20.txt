STORY OF KILLING OF
MANY BOERS REPEATED

Kimberley dated October 17 says: "All is
well hero. Colonel Hore engaged the

great sun ess. Mafeking was still safe
on â¢ >ctober 16."
A special dispatch to the Cape Argus
reiterates th.- statement that in the fight
ing in Mafeking Colonel Hore repulsed the
Boers, inflicting a loss of 300 men.
The Cape Times publishes the following
dispatch from Kimberley: Reliable in
formation from Mafeking says that an
armored train, while reconnoitering north
of the town last Saturday engaged 600
Boers, who suffered heavily. Colonel
Fitzclarence's column foiled the Boers, in
flicting severe loss. The British casualties
were two killed and fourteen wounded,
two severely."
Complaints of Boer outrages upon the
natives continue to arrive. These serve
further to inflame the Basutos and Zuius.
Yesterday 150 Basutos from Johannesburg
arrived at Burgherdorp, Cape Colony, and
alleged that the lfoors had robbed them
wholesale and Hogged them with black
snakes."
The party, which includes a son of
Lerothodi. was supplied with provisions,
and the Basutos then started homeward,
cheering the Cjucen and chanting war
songs.

TURBULENT SESSION OF
THE HOUSE OF COMMONS
Secretary Chamberlain Frequently Inter
rupted While Explaining That Great
Britain Must Be the Paramount
Power in South Africa.
LONDON, Oct. Floor and gal
leries were densely crowded to
day in the House of Commons in
anticipation of a speech by the
Secretary of State for the Colon
ies, Mr. Joseph Chamberlain, on
"The Government's Policy in South
Africa." The First Lord of the Treas
ury and the Government leader, Arthur
J. Balfour, promised to answer to-mor
row a question whether the Government
had decided upon a specific course of ac
tion with reference to the recommenda
tion of the International Commission,
respecting the future administration of
Samoa.
The Secretary of State for India, Lord
George Hamilton, replying to a question
on the expenditure for the Indian troops
in South Africa, said the entire charge
would be defrayed out of the imperial ex
chequer.
Mr. Balfour, in reply to an interpella
tion as to whether the imperial Govern
ment was now reviewing the action of
the Cape Colony Premier, Mr. Schreiner,
and other members of the Cape Govern
ment, and as to whether the Governor of
Cape Colony, Sir Alfred Milner, would
be allowed to dismiss the Schreiner Min
istry, to dissolve the Cape Legislature
and tem^orarUv to apsv naÂ« lt>H anthority,
said: ''This question is apparently found
ed upon newspaper reports, for which, so
far as the imperial Government is aware,
there is no foundation."
Mr. Balfour announced that the present
sitting of Parliament would be regarded
as a complete session, to be terminated
by prorogation and not adjourned, until
February.
Henry Seter-Karr, Conservative, in ac
cordance with notice given yesterday,
asked the First Lord of the Treasury
whether the attention of the Government
had been directed to certain speeches
and letters by and emanating from the
members for Kilkenny and East Clare,
Messrs. Patrick O'Brien and William Red
mond, Parnellites, advocating the cause
of the Boers, attempting to seduce Brit
ish soldiers and inciting them to actively
assist the enemies of the Queen, and
what action, if any, the Government pro
posed to take in the matter.
Mr. Redmond rose quickly and said that
before the First Lord of the Treasury re
plied he desired to ask him whether it
was not a fact that he (Mr. Redmond) in
suggesting a message of sympathy to
President Kruger, and only followed the
precedent followed by her Majesty's
grandson (the Emperor). (Laughter.)
Mr. Balfour replied as follows: "I was
not aware that the honorable member for
East Clare framed himself upon such an
august model. (Laughter.) I may point
out the difference between him and
the Emperor of Germanyâthat his im
perial Majesty is not a Britisher, nor a
CAPTAIN NESBITT AND
MEN WERE NOT KILLED
President Kruger Gives an Account of the
Destruction of the Train
at Kraai Pan,
LONDON, Oct. 19.â According to pri
vate Information received here from
Blnemfontein, the capital of the
Orange Free State, President TCru
ger telegraphed an account to Presi
dent Bteyn of the affair at Kraai
Pan, where the Boers derailed and bom
barded the British armored train carrying
Captain Nesbitt'a party. President Kru
ger said that Nesbitt and seven men were
seriously wounded, that/io one was killed
and that all the prisoners were doing well.
According to the same advices, a Dutch
farmer living in one of the border towns
has received a letter from a friend in the
Transvaal referring to the Mafeking af
fair as "bad business."
The transports which will convey the
army corps about to start for South Af
rica will go neither to Durban nor Cape
Town, both of which are already crowded
with refugees, but to Port Elizabeth, Port
Alfred and East London, from which
points railroads converged directly upon
the Free State border, where concentra
tion will be affected somewhere in the
neighborhood of Norvalspont. The ad
vance will then begin toward Pretoria.
Almost everything is in readiness for the
departure of the troops from Southamp
ton to-morrow, when rivo transports, each
carrying a thousand men with officers,
will start for South Africa. The first will
sail at 1:30 p. m., the others following at
intervals of half an hour.
A dis-patch from Pretoria asserts that
the Transvaal Government has cabled to
Joseph B. Robinson, the millionaire gold
mine owner and chairman of the Robinson
South African Banking Company, who is
now In London, to return to Johannesburg
on pain of confiscation of his property.
Mr. Robinson characterizes the alleged
threat as ridiculous. He says ho is a
British subject, that the Transvaal Gov
ernment has no right to demand his return

doubt the accuracy of the statements con
tained in the Question. So far as my
memory serves, support of a similar char
has invariably been offered by the
same quarters to those engaged in* hos
tilities with her .Majesty's Government,
quite Irrespective of race, creed or the
theater of hostilities. I have no ground
for thinking that Buch support was ever
regarded as important by those to whom
it was proffered, and I advise the House
to t j) k - â¢ the same view now." (Peals of
laughter.>
Mr. Chamberlain, who was loudly
rli. â .â¢rod on rising, began with a severe
criticism of the action of the opposition
at th<' previous meeting of Parliament.
Their statements, he Bald, were calculated
to encoiir- > dent ECruger's resist
ance and to emban Government
"in most difficult and critical functions."
Referring to .Mr. Stanhope's demand
yesterday for the production of his (Mr.
Chamberlain's) letter to Mr. Hawksley,
he said he would gladly produce this if
Sir William Vernofl Hareourt and John
Morley, who were members of the South
African Committee, demanded it. Sir
John Stanhope's crl character
ized as neither honesi nor honorable.
The Speaker. sir John Gul'^y, tÂ«r
wnsd, saying that the language of the
Colonial Secretary was beyond parlia
mentary bounds.
Mr. chamberlain retorted that it was
impossible adequately to describe Mr.
Stanhope's accusation that he (Chamber
lain) and Sir Alfred Milner had fomented
war. The Government welcomed all hon
est and honorable criticism of its policy,
said Mr. Chamberlain, "and 1 wish I
could apply these epithets to the speech
of the member for Bunnley."
Mr. Stanhope, leaping to his.feet, cried:
"1 rise to order. 1 thought fit yesterday
to arraign the conduct of the Secretary of
State for the Colonies. He speaks of my
criticism as dishonorable and dishonest.
c,ai such terms be applied to members
of this House?" (Opposition cheers.)
The Speaker said: "I think the language
of the Secretary of State for the Colonies
is going somewhat beyondâ" (The rest
of his words wire drowned in wild Irish
.!,.â , rs and shoots of "Withdraw.")
.Mr. Chamberlain calmly waited until the
uproar bad subsided and said: "I bow
with all respect, Mr. Speaker, to your de
cision. 1 withdraw everything' 1 have
said."
Then amid freauent ironical cheers he
proceeded to denounce the "camapign
slander," based upon his refusal to ac

Dealing with the criticisms made upon
the S6uth African League; Chamberlain
eaid he could not claim acquaintance with
a single member of it. The league was
one of the poorest pecuniarily; but at the
fame time one of the most representative
political organizations ever established.
"With regard to the accusations respecting
his associations with Cecil Rhodes, he

although a millionaire; had pone to face
danger at Kimberley. (Cheers)
Passing to the preneral question of the
Government's South African .policy. Mr.
Chamberlain said that in the light of, re
cent events and of the utterances of Pres
ident Kruger he had come to the conclu
sion that war had always been table.
although it was only of late that he had
himself most reluctantly reached this
view. He had hoped for peace and striven
to maintain it. and up to a recent date he
had believed that peace was possible. He
had always been determined to secure
justice for the Britishers in South Africa
and to maintain the paramountcy of Great
Britain. Whenever there had bt%n a
doubt as to President Kruger's motives
the Government had always given him the
benefit of the doubt. Turning to the prin
ciples involved in the war, the Colonial
Secretary went on to say:
"If we maintain our existence as a great
power in South Africa we are bound to
Bhow that we are willing and able to pro
tect British subjects wherever they have
suffered injustice and oppression. Great
Britain must remain the paramount
power in South Africa. 1 do not mean
i paramount in the German and Portu
guese. possessions, but in the two repub
lics and the British colonies. Every one
on both sides of the House is mined
to maintain these great principles. The
peace Qf South Africa depends upon Great
Britain accepting responsibility in the
Transva.il. The Boer oligarchy has placed
British subjects in a position of inferior
ity, and what would have been the British
position if they had submitted to that in-
Mr. Chamberlain then proceeded to dis
cuss the question of radical animosity, de
nying that this feeling, which he said was
based in South Africa on contempt, would
be increased by hostilities. He declared
that radical animosity had not been cre
ated by anything the present Government
had done, but that it existed before her
Majesty's present advisers assumed -â¢c
--â¢ Sir Henry U-Bannerman ;inter
posed with the remark: "What I wish to
point out is that the feeling of animosity
will be increased a hundred fold when the
Dutch and English are slaughtering each
other." (Opposition cheers^".?..
; Mr. Chamberlain retorted: "I say again
.that the radical animosity, -which nns
been the curse of South Africa, is base d
"on contempt. Hate Is !ad enough, but I
Would rather have a man's hate than his
contempt. There will never be an end of
radical animosity, nor will there ever be
peace in South Africa until both races
have learned to respect each other."
* Referring to the relations pf the Boers
with the natives. Mr. Chamberlain said:
'.'There is one subject not dealt with in
'the blue books. I mean the disgraceful
:J3oer treatment of the natives, unworthy
of a civilized power. In 1806 I actually
pent a message to Sir Hercules Robinson
for the Transvaal respecting the treat
ment of the natives. Then came the.
Jameson raid, and our South African of
licials decided that they could not with j
propriety present the message. The !
80.-rs, in their own words, trekked be
cause they wanted to wallop the niggers."
John Dillon cried. "That lÂ»-Â«iot true."
This was followed by loud demands for
order, and the. Speaker called upon Mr.
Dillon to withdraw his remark. The lat
ter responded, "I have not impeached the
veracity of the Colonial Secretary."
'The Speaker said. "I hope such expres
sions will not occur again."
Proceeding to discuss the question of
supremacy, Mr. Chamberlain said: "The
whole object of the Boers has been to
oust the Queen from her position as suze
rain. Now they have thrown off the.
mask and declared themselves a sov
ereign, independent state. Her Majesty's
Government has had a suspicion, amount
ing to knowledge, thai the mission of
Dr. Ley da has been one continual series
of negotiations with foreign powers
against the British. (Loud cheers.) The
Transvaal and the Free State have an
ideal which is dangerous to Great Britain,
an by the continuous accretions of arms
the Transvaal had become by far the most
powerful military state in Africa. That
was a danger, and we have escaped one of
the greatest dangers we were ever sub
jected to in Africa. The whole point of

tion, it was very unfortunate that Par
liament was not sitting the tirst week in
â  inber. or the seven-year franchise
would have been accepted, and there
w..uid have been no war. Chamberlain's
conduct of the correspondence he charac
terized as must cluni:-y.
John Morley, Liberal member for the
Mi. in rose District, rising to speak, was
greeted with loud cheers by the opposi
tion, fie said: "A very material change
has come over the spirit of the discussion
since the brilliant, eloquent, forcible and
unanswerable speech of Sir Edward
I'larke, and it now seems as if we are
going to war, not for the franchise, but
uzorainty. T'ndcr the name of para
mouhtcy we are going to impose on the
Transvaal obligations which the Govern
ment would not. for the life of them,
dare impose upon, any self-governing col
ony."
chamberlain interposed: "If we could
imagine such a case of a self-governing
colony imposing upon a majority of its in
; habitants such conditions as the Boers
! imposed upon British subjects, we should
I intercere or cut the connection."
Mr. Morley contended that in New-
I found la nd was a remarkable ca.se of
alienation of territory in favor of an in
dividual, but though that corresponded
to the position of affairs In the Transvaal
Mr. Chamberlain refused to interfere.
Mr. chamberlain tÂ»aJd the cases were in
no way comparable.
Mr. Morley, resuming, challenged Mr
Chamberlain to try to control the educa
tional systf-m in Canada as ho had tried
to do in the Transvaal. Ho further said
"l am prepared to Justify my vote in any
constituency which will give me a fair
hearing. Before a month Is past good
S< ase, love of Justice and hatred of un
necessary war will entirely justify me
Your farmer great trader said he brought
back peace with honor." Cries of "Ma
jiifm.") "This, then, is revengeâ" a^ourf
Liberal cheers, Mr. Dillon shouting "re
venge and robbery.") "I regret that so
distinguished a man should have aban
i the traditions and examples of the
party ho formerly led. I do not desire to
unsay In 'his House a single word I said
In the country." d^tnl ohoers.)
Leonard Henry Courtney, sitting for
the division of Cornwall in tho Liberal
interests, indorsed Mr. Morley He nro
tested against the exaggeration n f the
Outlandettf grievances and contend^
thai taxation in the Transvaal was
lighter than in Natal.

Speaker. Dealing with the speeches of

fense of the Boor Government was ludi

ent to thf world. He would not say there
was reason to drag In Majuba Hill That
was a very smnll action, less than half
a regiment being concerned, and in his
judgment might b<? absolutely ignored in
the prewm controversy and in any fur

were determined at all hazards to avoid
a solution Involving a .change in the ex-'
istiiis system of government.
"The reason I pive for the war," Mr.
Balfour continued. "Is not this or that
f-entiment in the dispatches. It is the
delinerate intention of the Transvaal to
I avoid at all cost giving the franchise, to
I wriggle until wriggling became Ineffec
tual and then to appeal to the arbitra
ment of war. The last thing the Boers
wanted was an agreement, provide*
agreement meant genuine representation
fnr the Outlanders."
In conclusion he reminded the members
that the division would be taken in Eu
rope and Africa not as a condemnation
: of the Government's diplomacy, but as an
I attack on the trood faith of the country
and an indication thai the Government
Intended deliberately to provoke war for
the purpose of territorial acquisition.
I A member rising to continue the debate,
' Mr. Ralfrmr moved closure, which was
carried by a vote of 356 to 158.

Stanhope's amendment to the address dis
approving of the conduct of the negotia

ORANGE RIVER, Oct 18 (delayed In

The driver suspected that the
Boers were In possession and stopped thÂ«>
train, whereupon the Boers issued In
large force and opened fire, but without
I any efl
The soldiers replied from the train and
about half a dozen Boers were killed.
The British were unscathed.
Seven hundred Boers surprised a party
of thirteen Cape Colony police, who were
guarding the railway at Riverton Road,
eighteen miles north of Kimberley, on
Sunday morning. The police retired. A
â¢ explosion was heard later, and it
Is believed that the Boers blew up the
station. A relief party of twenty-five
police sent from Kimberley met the
Boers near Riverton. The enemy dis
played a white tlae to Induce the troops
to fall into their trap, but the police
w.rc ordered to retire. Then the Boers
opened a heavy lire, upon them, dis
charging about 4nii rounds. A bullet
struck the horse of Burgeon Major Sulli
van, who, with a trooper, whose horse
had stumbled and dismounted him, was
captured.

SHELLED CAVALRY PATROLS
DURBAN, Oct. lfÂ» (delayed in trans
mission). The following note has Deen
Issued regarding the Boer advance:
"An Orangi Free State force, with a
few puns, moved about ten miles down
Tintwa Pass, opening with artillery on
small British cavalry patrols. The range
was very distant and the shooting indif
ferent. The object may have been either
a feint to draw our troops from the real
point of attack or a prelude to oJoer con
centration against Ladysmith."
There is an Tncessant procession "f ap
plicants for active military service, and
the new tore.' of 3000 mounted infantry
which the Imperial Government has
sanctioned will he quickly raised.
Th.' Premier. Mr. Bchreiner, continues
to issue circulars to the Dutch residents,
advising them to maintain strict loyalty
to the Imperial Government.
The best authorities now agree that the
danger of a general revolt is slight.

MRS. STORKE AGAIN
APPEARS IN COURT
Enters a Plea of Not Guilty and tho
â¢"Date for the Trial Is
. Set.
SANTA BARBARA, Oct. 19.-Yda Addis
Storke appeared In co^irt this afternoon,
the time set for the court to give Its de
cision on the demurrer to the Information
argued six weeks ago by Clara Foltz. The
court overruled the demurrer, and after
the defendant had entered her plea of not
guilty the attorneys ascertained that dur
ing: the confusion of objections and de
murrers which were made and the fact
that a new- Judge was sitting on the
bench the formal arraignment of Mrs.
Storke had been overlooked.
The court then withdrew Its. decision
and the case was left where It was at the
beginning. Mrs. Storke pleaded not
guilty to the charge of attempting to
murder Attorney Grant Jackson. The
time for the hearing was set for Novem
ber 8. She looked the picture of despair
to-day and complained of failing health.

MYSTERIOUS LETTER
SENT CORONER EDEN
Author Declares EbeQezer Wor
mouth's Stomach hjas Been
Removed for AQalysis.
SAX RAFAEL. Oct. 19. â Coroner Edward Eden received an anonymous i
communication to-day, I" which th" author declares he has positive informa
tion that the remains of the lato Rbenezer Wormouth, the Mill Valley capi
talist, -who recently committed suicide by hanping himself in his sleeping:
apartment, have been disinterred and the stomach removed in order that the
contents might be chemically analyzed on account of a belief that the de
ceased came to his death by poisoning. This communication will cause con
siderable interest in view of the pecjliar circumstances surrounding the rays
terious poisoning of Wormouth a short time previous to his decease. The Cor
oner will probably confer with L. EL Bonestell, the executor of Wormouth's
regarding the advisability of an investigation.
The letter, which was written on a half-sheet of letter paper, with the seal
of the manufacturing firm cut off, was inclosed in a plain envelope, mailed f .n
San Francia o and read as follows:
BAN FRANCISCO, October 1?.
Comner Eden, Snn Rafaelâ Pear f-!r: The writer has positive evidence that the
body of Ebenezer Wormouth l>an been disinterred and the stomach removed for
â¢h â iiiiru] analysis on suspicion that ho was poisoned. The body was then reburled.
â¢>t the law. An investigation will prove the truth of those statements.
I am not in a position t.. give my name..
"The â  ropi r person t" make an investigation of (his character," said Cor
oner Eden to-day, "is the District Attorney. Any man may file information
with him and rest srmre in th.' knowledge that his name will not figure hi j
subsequent proceedings. It would be an easy matter to remove a body from <
â¢:â¢ , SauÃalit metery, where Wormouth is buried, because of its isolated i
situation. What strps I shall take will probably depend on the desire of Mr. '
; tell."

him with their rifle?, disarmed him and
then clubbed and stamped on him.
Then they rained a regular fusillade

COLUMBIA THE LEADER IN
ANOTHER DRIFTING MATCH
Extra Ballast Put Aboard the Shamrock to Alter
Her Trim Seemed to Retard Rather Than
Help Her Progress.
NEW YORK, Oct. 19.â Another fluke, I
another day of light airs and calms
and drifting and guessing as to i
whether either boat would ever i
reach the outer mark. Both man
aged to get back to the finish be
fore the time limit had expired. The
Columbia was ahead In the drift around
the stake boat, and she was still further
in the lead when that much overworked
signal of "No race" was made.
If Sir Thomas Lipton got any consola
tion out of the day's doings the reason
for it was not apparent to any one who
followed the fortunes of the yachts. The
extra ballast which had been placed in i
the Shamrock to alter the trim of that \
vessel did not bring about the desired re- ;
sult. So far from any improvement be- j
ing shown in the Shamrock's speed, It j
seemed that the contrary effect had been I
produced. The Columbia gained the ad- |
vantage at the start and steadily in- j
creased her lead, despite ail efforts of the j
Shamrock to outfoot her. So long as the j
wind held the Shamrock continued to drop i
astern, and when the two floated into a j
zone of calm the Shamrock showed that |
she could drift no faster than could the
Columbia. l;s- : yÂ£'>
So it must be counted as a failure, this
experiment with ballast, a failure at least
in such winds, or lack of them, as were
about to-day. Outfooted in the run, the
(shamrock was also distanced in the beat
back toward the finish line. Even the
most ardent of her admirers are now
forced to admit that the fehamrock is no
match for the Columbia in light weather. |
The two are yet to have a fair trial in a
stilt breeze, the test of Tuesday being |
inconclusive and unsatisfactory because j
of the accident which crippled the chal
lenger when the race had barely begun.
Tnere was a bit of maneuvering be
fore the start, and in it neither vessel (
scored any signal advantage over the
other. Both were in good positions when
the starting signal was given. The
course was a ritteen mile run to south
ward before a north breeze and back to
the finish line. The wind at the time was
from the north and was blowing about {
eight miles an hour. The Columbia ,
showed the way over the line, followed
at a close inter, by the ShamrocJc, the .
cup defender going over it at 11:01:33, the
challenger at 11:02:00. The Shamrock was ;
handicapped by two seconds in starting
as she tailed to start within the two
minutes allowed.
Both yachts took in jib and staysail as
they headed across the line, and as the
Shamrock went over it she set her bal
loon jib and dropped her spinnaker boom
to starboard. The Columbia set her bal
loon Jib one minute after the Irish cut
ter had Bent hers bellying to the wind,
and netting her spinnaker boom to star
board, tent up her spinnaker in stops.
Then followed a lufllng match, the Sham
rock heading to the westward in an et
fort to blanket the Columbia, and the
cup : 'fender sheering over In the same
direction to prevent the Shamrock get
ing the position dead astern, which she
was striving to gain. Such of the ex
cursion fleet as were to the westward of
the course were forced to swing still fur
ther inshore, half a dozen torpedo boats
guarding that side of the line, driving
pleasure craft before them.
The Shamrock was persistent, but when
at last she found herself directly astern
of the Columbia, the position which she
had coveted and tried so long to gain, the
defender was so far ahead that no ad
vantage accrued from it. The two were
then nearing the belt of calm into which
they soon found their way, and all the
rest was driftingâ a slanting of sail to idle
airs, or listless swelling of the canvas.
The aprroach to the outer mark was
made with that prodigality of leisure
which distinguishes the flow of mo
lasses in cold weather. The Columbia,
dipping sunlight In and out of her droop
ing - ills, seemed in no hurry to get
around the mark. The Shamrock was
inertia personified. She slowly drifted to
ward the quiet buoy which marked the
end of the fifteen-mile run, the excur
sion fleet patiently awaiting the outcome
of the effort to turn the stake.
Almost imperceptibly the Columbia les- j
ned the distance between herself and j
the mark, and taking in her drooping |
spinnaker languidly swung ; around the |
buoy. That was at 2:24:15. Six minutes !
and fifteen seconds later the Shamrock :
followed her around the mark.
After that the only element of interest
which remained hung about the problem
i as to by what margin the Columbia would
win, SO badly had she beaten the chal
lenger in the run down and so rapidly
was Â«he drawing away from her on the
boat back to the finish. Later on It be-
I came apparent that there was to be no |
race at all. as the wind remained light j
and there was no hope of either yacht i
i finishing within the time limit allowed.
So it was the same old ending. Two ;
miles away from the finish line the time
limit expired at 4:30, and the race was j
declared off. The Columbia was then a <
full mile In the lead. The yachts will try i
it again to-morrow over the same course j
of fifteen miles to windward or to leeward
and return. An unusually large excursion i
fleet was out to view this effort of the
yachts to race. All the boats were excep
tionally well patronized, the Grand Duch- ;
o??e or the Plant line carrying fully 1500
guests.
Sir Thomas I.lpton was greatly disap
pointed at the failure of the wind, and as
he shook hands witn his departing guests
on board the Erin he seemed for once to
have lost some of the buoyant confidence
which until this had been superior to
calms and accidents.
'â¢I am very sorry the wind failed." said
he. "What we want Is a good, stiff breeze.
This seems to be the only country In the
world where there is no wind. I received
a telegram the other day from a gentle
man who suggested t+iat If I had come
during a Presidential campaign there I
wouid have been plenty of it."
In answer to a question. Sir Thomas '
said he though it would be an excellent I
Idea to have extra races to give the mer- '
its of the yachts a more thorough test !
than they have had.
When asked if he thought the Shamrock \
had shown herself a more dangerous rival
since remeasurement. Mr. Iselln said:
"No, I do not think so. We' led her by
two miles."
Mr. Iselin was told of a reported offer
of a cup for another series of races be
tween the Columbia and Shamrock, and i
asked if his yacht would compete. "i '
want to end the present series before I I
think of another," he replied. "We want
to have it over by Christmas."
Mr. Iselin paid that for the same reason
ho would not at present consider any
suggestion to complete the five races If
the Columbia should win the next and de
ciding contest.
TECHNICAL STORY OF
LAST UNFINISHED RACE
N'KTV YORK, Oct. IS.â Clear weather
and a fine breeze from the northwest
greeted the skippers and rrewg of the Co
lumbia ;ind Shamrock at sunrise this
morning', and thr> occasional puffs that
made little whttecapa on Sandy Hook Bay
p.'tvo promise of plenty of wind for the
third race of the International series.
Both boats were taken in tow before 9
o clock. Eager to try his large club top- I
sail on his new topmast, Captain Hogarth
made sail on the Shamrock on the way
out to the lightship, and by 9:15 the tow
line had been cast off and she was under
way with everything on her, including the
baby jib topsail. It was 10 o'clock when
the Columbia cast off from her tug, broke
out the jib and began to sail about with I
mainsail and jib set. Fifteen minutes
later her largest club topsail was set, and
soon after the staysail was broken out.
At 10:30 the course was signaled from the
committee boat, which had anchored to
the westward of the lightship. It was
southeast by south, showing that the
wind was northwest by north, and the
probability was that it would be a spin
naker start. About the time the tug
started to log off the course of fifteen
miles to leeward the patrol fleet of rive
revenue cutters, five torpedo-boats and
11 8^*â¢ ftch t Erin arrived off the
| Lightship. - â  The Shamrock took In her
baby Jib topsail and set up her ballooa
NEW YORK, Oct. 20.â At 4 o'clock
this morning the lookouts at Sandy
Hook and the Highlands reported
that a very light west wind was
blowing, not exceeding two miles an
hour.
Jib topsail on the stay in stops at 10:40,
the Columbia having done the same a few
moments before. The preparatory signal
was given at 1u:45, the warning at 1u:55,
the start at 11, the handicap gun at Il:u2.
The maneuvering before the start was
remarkably interesting work. Excursion
boats and yachts gave the racing craft
plenty of room, and Barr and Hogarth
nad iheir little game all to themselves.
At the warning signal both yachts, with
booms to starboard and sheets flattened
well In, were sailing to the northeast,
parallel to the line but about a quarter of
a mile north of it, with the wind a little
abaft the beam. The Columbia was to
windward, with the Shamrock on her lee
beam a couple of lengths away. It being
necessary to use the Jive minutes between
the warning and starting signals, both
yachts leaned far over to the northeast,
gradually lufling to me northward. When
three minutes were left the Columbia
luffed into the wind, then coming about
headed for the line. Hogarth, instead of
tacking like the Columbia, wore the
Shamrock sharp around on her heel,
bringing her close up under the Colum
bia's lee, both having booms to port.
Hogarth lost both time and headway by
lufhng Instead of tacking, so that when
the Shamrock hauled up nearly on the
wind the Columbia, under better head
way, was pointed straight for the line, a
couple of lengths to the good. As soon as
Hogarth realized this he broke out the
Bhamrock's balloon jib topsail, her crew
trimming the sheets smartly just as the
gun was fired. The Columbia's crew broke
out her balloon sail while the smoke from
the gun was blowing away.
The Columbia crossed the line twenty
seven seconds in the lead without the
handicap, which means fully two lengths'
distance. She crossed about the center
of the line and Hogarth, after a vain at
tempt to luff out across her wake and
obtain the weather position, kept off and
pay-- the Shamrock a good full.
The official time of the start was: Co
lumbia, 11:01:33; Shamrock. 11:02.
The Shamrock's actual time In cross
ing the line was 11:02:02. She was handi
capped two seconds because the yachts
are allowed seven minutes from the
starting signal in which to cross the line,
and she exceeded that time by two sec
onds. Jibs and forestay sails were taken
in at once on both yachts to give the
balloon sails a chance to till. While the
yachts were crossing the line spinnaker
booms were dropped to starboard and the
sails hoisted in stops ready to break out,
but in the Kianii- of luffing and bluff which
followed, neither yacht had a chance to
set these .-huh for fifty minutes. ilo
garth, not i"-ing able to try his yacht
on a reach on a triangular course, seem
ed determined to maKe a portion of the
ra< â â  << reach at all hazards. So they
went at it. Instead of following the
guideboat on the southeast by south i
c, by which they mleht have carried
spinnakers, they sailed between four and i
five points to the eastward of their
courses in order to make every sail draw i
to t lie best advantage, thereby covering
Ist five miles more ground than was
necessary. The excursion fleet gave
them miles of room, keeping so far away
that the yachts were "hull down" most of '
the time.
1 mring the first fifteen minutes of this I
reaching work the Columbia seemed to
increase her lead. After that, for the j
next halt" hour, thÂ«? Shamrock apparently
was gaining on the Columbia and at
11:50, when they both decided to abandon
the lulling game and set spinnakers to
starboard, tne Shamrock had certainly
gained some on her antagonist. Having
the wind dead aft npw, the Shamrock had
decidedly tne better position. If, with
the assistance of some of the friendly
pulTs, she could succeed in closing in oh
the Columbia her chances of blanketing
the latter would be felt. While the
wind remained steady In the same quar
ter it diminished in strength at times,
coming in puffs occasionally, but on the.
whole the outlook for finishing the race
was not very encouraging at 1 o'clock.
when the outer mark was in plain sight
from the racing yachts.
At 12:45 both yachts gibed after taking
in ihtir spinnakers and set. those Sails
ajrain to port, the Columbia setting hers
tii'st. The wind canted to the westward
gradually during the next half hour and
at 1:X- the Columbia gibed to port, quickly
followed by the Shamrock, which dropped
her spinnaker boom to starboard ana set
the sail iit 1:40, the Columbia setting her
Bpinnaker four minutes later.
it was a long run before the wind, with
simply enough of it to liil their sails dur
ing the next forty-five minutes. Balloon
jib topsails were taken in when the yachts
wore about a mile north of the outer
mark, and as they approached it .jibs,
staysails and baby Jib topsails were hoist
ed, ready for the windward work soon to
follow, it was noted that as the Colum
bia came down for the mark her
great mainsail with its crosscut cloths
was a brand new one. having in it four
battens and two reef bands. The cloths
in her spinnaker ran horizontally, while
those on tl:>- Bhamrocli were perpen
dicular. At 2:20 tlif Columbia took in her
spinnaker and ail hands stood by to
round in the main sheet as she ap
proached the mark.
The Shamrock's spinnaker came in at
2:27. The official time of the turn was:
Columbia, 2:24:46; Shamrock, 2:?,1:Q.i.
By this it will be seen that the Colum
bia was six minutes eighteen seconds
ahead at the m;rrk. that her elapsed time
was three hours twenty-three minutes
twelve seconds, and that the Shamrock's
was three hours twenty-nine minutes
thirty-two seconds, showing that the
Columbia's gain had actually been
five minutes fifty-one seconds "in the
fifteen miles. When Columbia luffed
around the mark, coming up sharp on the
wind on the starboard tack, Captain Barr
found the wind to be about west by north,
which meant that if it held in that
quarter he would be able on the other
tack to lay his course for the finish with
out making another tack. One minute
and twenty seconds after rounding the
mark he put the Columbia about and
found his judgment to be correct, and, bet
ter still, the wind freshened considerably
during the next half hour, sending the
white sloop along at a six-knot clip. Ho
garth, who went breeze hunting off to the
southward for eight minutes and ten
seconds, lost just about that amount of
time, for when he tacked and stood to the
northwest like the Columbia, his im
aginary advantage was that he was to the
windward of the Columbia's wake, while
the latter yacht was nearly two miles
ahead of him and pointing direct to the
finish. . _
As the Columbia stood on to the north
west, the wind canted to the southward
gradu&Hy, and at 3:35 she was able to
set a big topsail in place of the baby.
She also eet a balloon staysail. Fifteen
minutes later the wind had canted lo
south-southwest. Down came the Colum
bia's jib topsail and up went a larger one.
The Shamrock followed suit a few
minutes later. The wind was now falling
lighter every moment. The Shamrock
was nearly thr^p miles astern of the Co
luntbia and while the lightship was in
slgnt from the Columbia's derks she was
still five miles from it at 4 o'clock with
only half an hour of time left to 'finish
within the limit. At 4:10 the committee
boat sheered in toward the yachts and
at 4:19 exactly she fired a gun and hoisted
a signal declaring the race off. The
yachts kept their sails drawing and head
ed toward the finish for some ten minutes
longer, until their respective tugs came
alongside and took them in tow.
When the race was declared off the Co
lumbia jvas leading by about three miles
She had sailed toward the finish about
eleven miles. So ended the eighth fluke
of the interesting series. The yachts will
race to-morrow over a similar course to
windward or leeward and return.
UPTON AND ISELIN
BOTH APPEAR WEARY
NEW YORK. Oct. 19.â Before the Erin
left her moorings In the Horseshoe to
steam out to the lightship Sir Thomas
cast bia weather eye ekyward and gave it
as his opinion that there would be no ]
race.
"My experience over here." he sail,
"convinces me that winds from the north
or west do not hold We shall have a â 
start, but not a finish. I ;im sorry, â¢â¢on, !
for I had hoped to have a eood blow.
Then if we were beated tn<_-r<. wutito .Â«.
nothing left to say."
Both racers had gone out from their
anchorages when the Erin g-ot under way,
and the big steam yacht followed th. m
to the starting point, while the hundred j
or more guests breakfasted or gathered
i en her decks and discussed- the chances
I of the day.
When the gun from the committee boat
i announced that the time limit had elapsed ;
! and that "no race" was again the verdict
1 the Erin 6teamed back to the Horseshoe
and Sir Thomas' guests went home. Sir
! Thomas himself was clearly tired of the
1 whole affair. He has been living aboard
his boat in the Horseshoe for more than
a month, with but an occasional visit en
shore.
"I wish." said he, "that we could have
had a good breeze and have settled the
question one way or another."
Asked if he favored the suggestion that
I two more races be sailed in the event of
I the Columbia winning three straight and ]
; the cup, Sir Thomas replied in the affiim
-1 ative, adding that it mteht be a good plan.
, Said he: "I am willing to stay a little
i longer in order to get at least one more
triangular race and the chances of a rare
iÂ»in a stiff breeze. Of course, it would have
'â¢ no effect on the possession of the cup, j
which will go to the Columbia If she wins
! another race."
C. Oliver Iselin, looking a trifle weary i
; after his race against time, was seen on
the Columbia when she was towed into
\ the Hook about 6 o'clock.
"T am very sorry it turned out as it
did," said Mr. Iselin in answer to a query.
â¢ "Everything went well on board the Co
; himbia. and we are all right. TherÂ» will j
' be a race to-morrow, and we are ready."
CUP OFFERED FOR
AN EXTRA RACE
NEW YORK, Oct. 19.â The Evening
World announces to-day that, in con
junction with the Daily Mail of London,
it offers a cup to be sailed for by the
Shamrock and the Columbia for an ex
tra race on a day to be agreed upon by
Mr. Iselin and Sir Thomas Lipton. The
World suggests that a change of crews
be made in order to settle the question
as to whether the crew of the Columbia
Is better than that of the Shamrock, or
vice versa.
MR. LOVER TO BE
NEXT TO CHALLENGE
LONDON, Oct. 20.â A provincial paper
is authority for the statement that if the
Shamrock fails to win the America's cup
Mr. Lover, a millionaire soap manufac
turer, intends to issue a challenge for a
series of races in 1900.
PRESBYTERIANS OF
STATE IN SESSION
Synod Is Organized by the Election
of Alexander Parker to Serve
as Moderator.
STOCKTON, Oct. 19.â Two gatherings of
the Presbyterians of this district and this
State have occupied the attention of the
ministers of that church to-day and this
evening. Nearly i'.Â»j ministers are in this
city, to remain here until the final ad
journment next Monday. The sessions of
this morning ;ind this afternoon were only
of the Stockton Presbytery, and about
the only business of interest was the
nmughtening of the Armenian Presbyter
ian Church of Fresno, where Rev. Lysan
der T. Burbank, a returned missionary to
Armenia, has been pastor for some time.
A very large portion of the congregation
were willing to have a change some six
months or more ago, but when it. was be
fore the spring session of the Presbytery
it was found to be a hard thing to handle.
Rev. Mr. Burbank waÂ« retired during the
six months, but the Presbytery to-day de
cided in favor of declaring the pulpit va
| cant and permitting the church to select
! a new minister if It can find one.
This evening Rev. Robert C'oyle, the re
', tiring moderator of the State Synod,
: preached the opening sermon of that
body. His subject was the forgiveness of ]
; sin, "and he carried his large audience with
him. At the close of his sermon the synod
was organized by the election or Alexan
der Parker of the Los Angeles Presbytery j
as moderator, 'me permanent clerk Is I
Frank Babb of San Jose, and the stated
clerk is William S. Young of Los Angeles.
The report of the committee of arrange
; merits was changed so as to give the first
I hour of synod business meeting to-morrow
! morning and the first hour of the popular
. meeting to-morrow night to the discussion
of the proposed constitutional amend- j
! ments exempting church property from
j execution. There will be sessions* of the
synod and of the Women's Synodical So
j ciety of Home Missions to-morrow.
HANNA SPEAKS ON
SUBJECT OF TRUSTS
CLEVELAND, Oct. 1?.-Senator Hanna
in a speech before the Fifth District Re
publican Club to-night defined his posi
tion regarding the trusts. On this sub
ject he said:
"The Democrats pay I am afraid to talk
about trust?. That settles it. I'm g>oing
to talk about them. This combination of
capital for one purpose or another is not
a political question at all. It is a business
question ;md ought not to have been
brought into politics. When our indus
tries were in their infancy England and
otli'-r countries came along and sold goods
in this country at less than the price
aÂ«k<=ii in their own country. Then fol
lowed the protective tariff law formu
lated by that friend of the workingman,
William MeKinley. Having secured this
protection American manufacturers went
abroad. They are making rapid strides
and are successfully competing with the
whole world. It is evident, however, that
they cannot continue to do so unless they
have combined capital. We ought to own
and control our own merchant vessels.
We then would be in shape to make our
own rates and compete with other nations
on an equal footing. This formation of
combines is simply an evolution in busi
ness methods. The so-called trusts are
not new. They have been found in Eng
land and Germany as far back as 200
years and are increasing. Therefore, from
a business standpoint of view, the forma
tion of these combinations in one sense is
a step forward. However, if the trusts
are a menace to the country what party
better than the Republican party can give
you relief? When it comes down to plain
facts the various labor organizations are
a sort of a tru&t. and I believe In them
and always have."
BLANCHE WALSH LOSES

Mysterious Attack.
BALTIMORE. Oct. 19.â The curtain was
rung down at the close of the second act
of "Gismonda" to-night because Miss
Blanche Walsh suddenly lost her voice.
A physician was called upon the stage,
but could not restore her voice so as to
enable her to continue and the audience
was dismissed. The case is mysterious and
baffles the skill of the best physicians in
the city.

SAYS WILCOXSON HEIRS
TRIED TO BRIBE HER
Mrs. Jackson Alleges Dr. Clow of=
fered Compensation and Used
the Name of the Elks.
SACRAMENTO, Oct. 19.â A tremendous
sensation was caused in this city to-day
by an incident In the trial of the action
brought by Miss Amanda Austin to re
cover $150,000 from the estate of her de
ceased uncle, Jefferson Wilcoxson, a mil
lionaire banker and ranch-owner. The
testimony thus far adduced has gone to
show that Miss Austin had held a high
place in the affections of her aged uncle
and that he intended to leave her the
sum of $150,000, which he had locked in
the safe in his office, to be delivered to
her, in accordance with a letter accom
panying it, immediately after his death.
George Wilcoxson, a nephew and execu
tor of the will, found the money, but
claims to have discovered nothing indi
cating that it was to go to Miss Austin,
since her name was not mentioned in the
will.
The defense in the present action will
attempt to show that Miss Austin is not
entitled to the amount, which has been
merged into the estate, in which, owing
to hf>r omission from the will, she is to
have no share. Among the hosts of wit
nesses called by Mins Austin in support
of her claims are Mrs. George W. Jack
son, wife of the superiutendent of the
Capital Gas Company, and a woman
whose word is unimpeachable. To-day
an affidavit sworn to by her was read in
court charging that on October 11 Dr. G.
B. N. Clow, a physician of this city, call
ed upon her at her home and asked her
to change the testimony she was going
to give in the action so as to make it
more favorable to the defendants and less
favorable to Miss Aftstin, the plaintiff.
Dr. Clow informed her. so the affidavit
charges, that in return for this service
she would receive a consideration.
Mrs. Jackson confided the matter to
NO REDRESS FOR
ALIENATED AFFECTIONS
Remarkable Decision Handed Down
by the Supreme Court of
Massachusetts.
BOSTON, Oct. 19.â A remarkable deris
ion of the full bench of the Supreme Court
in a novel case interesting to married
women was rendered to-day in the case
of -Mrs. Ella M. Houghton of Hudson vs.
Klla M. Rice of thfÂ» same place, holding
that a wife has no right of action against
another woman for the alienation of her
husband's affections where no adultery is
alleged. The court sustains a demurrer
which the defendant filed to th^ plaintiff's
declaration, thereby setting aside a ver
dict of $10,041. which a Mi<idlÂ«-=.->x jury
awarded the plaintiff. The court says:
"We do not think the declaration in this
"?" sets fortn any cause of action at
common law. if the husband had been the
plaintiff instead of the wife, and no stat
ute of this commonwealth gives the wife
any greater right than the husband in
cases of this nature.
"The acts charged are that the defendant
did ingratiate herself Into the affections

tain exactly what Clow wanted. A sec
ond Visit was made to the Jackson resi
dence by Clow, who repeated his propo
sition, adding, when asked who had sent
him, that it was an Elk. Mrs. Jackson's
husband is the exalted ruler of the local
lodge of Elks and Clow is likewise promi
nent In the organization. Mrs. Jackson
spurned the inducement to commit per

the physician.
Another sensation, somewhat less Btart
ling, but none the less significant, waa
produced when an affidavit was read
from Mrs. E. A. Davis of Sulphur Creek,
Colusa County, a witness for Miss Aus
tin, wherein she charged that on Septem
ber 22 at Sulphur Creek she was offered
a bribe of $1000 by Tilden Jones of Sul
phur Creek, together with a railroad
ticket out of the State, if she would stay
away until after the trial was over.
Just before adjournment to-night the
counsel for the plaintifi placed on the
stand Edward Twitchell, one of the
appraisers of the estate. His testimony
being objected to, the plaintiffs counsel
set forth that it was intended to be
proved by the witness that the keys to
the safe containing the $150,000 had been
taken from the deceased two days before
nis death by the defendants, that the
contents were removed and that the keys
were not returned until after Wilcoxson's
c'eath.
Judge Elliston of Tehama County Is
presiding in the case. No arrests have
yet been ordered as a result of the sen
sational affidavits, and it is thought that
t.Ms feature of the case will not be
taken up until the testimony of all the

The Favcrite. Admiration, Is Beaten
at Morris Park.
NEW YORK, Oct. 19.â The Ratnapo and
Fordham high-weight handicaps were the
features at Morris Park to-day. In the
former Admiration was the favorite, but
was disgracefully beaten, finishing fourth
in a field cf six. The Duke of Middleburg,
the outsider, made the running to the
last sixteenth pole, when A N B at 8 to 1
came on with a well-timed rush and got
the decision bj- a head. The Duke of
Middleburg was mx lengths before Prince
McClurg third. The Fordhaln resulted in
one of the Ix-st finishes of the season, for
a blanket could have covered four of the
horses at the end. Richard J, the favorite,
won driving by half a length, while heads
separated Kinnikinnick, Elfin Conig and
Oneck Queen, who finished in that order.
' The stewards have refused the entry of
any horses belonging to M. Clancey and
W. Lakeland, and the case of the former
has been referred to the Jockey Club for
further action. The in-and-out running
of Maximo Gomez was responsible for the
action. Results:

BANNERS OVER STREETS.
Merchants Urge Supervisors to Stand
by the Ordinance.
The Merchants' Association has pone nn
re.-,>rd in regard to the manner of banners
being strung across the streets to an
nounoe the candidacy of offloe Beekers.
Then has been some fear thai the Super
visors would gram privileges to ivrtuin
matter of hanging ban
and at a meeting of the directors
rday the merchants addressed a
communication to the Supervisors ui^cinf?
them to stand by the ordinance. In con
cluding the communication the directors
said:
Certainly, this ordinance so uniformly an.l
rtially applicable, baa the hearty support

Averag-e of Bank Deposits
L-iJun me uasis 01 an estimate just mane
upon returns from fifty-one savings
banks, the depositor in California savings
institutions still maintains a high average
showing with his funds. The average sum
credited to the city depositor is $794 81.
The country depositor has not quite bo
much money to call his own in bank, but
he li credited- with the average sum of
$472 74. Taking the deposits in the city
and In the country savings banks, the
showing is an average for depositors of
$697 97 each. This does not include returns
from two savings banks, which are miss
ing, but the average Is practically cor
rect. In fact, the showing will probably
be better when it is next made up by the
Bank Commissioners, for this estimate is
based on returns up to last January, and
the deposits have increased since the tie
ginning of the year at. the rate of $2,000,000
per month. This justifies the belief that
the average is really higher than the one
submitted in the foregoing, but there are
no returns up to date to base an absolute
ly correct statement upon.
The addition of the two banks from
which the returns are not Included could
not affect the average materially. There
are 197,906 depositors in the fifty-one sav
ings banks reporting. In these banks is
the sum of $138,133,247 40. Of this amount
the city savings banks have, in round fig
ures, $110,000,000 and the country savings
banks have, also in round figures, $28,000,

A VERY NARROW ESCAPE.
Why F. H. Dakin Congratulates Him-
self on a Splintered Thighbone.
F. H. Dakin, a mine owner of Shasta
County, has gone to his home in Kennett.
after having spent several days under a
doctor's rare in this city.
The reason of Mr. Dakln's visit to San
Francisco was to receive surgical treat
ment for a splintered thighbone, the in-
Jury being the result of a fall from a
horse that nearly cost the gentleman his
life.
A few days ago Mr. Dakin started. In
company with a mining expert, to Inspect
some properties in which fie is Interest* d
on the upper Sacramento River. The trip
was made on horseback and ltd the two
gentlemen over some very dangerous
mountain trails.
While traversing the most ticklish part
of the route the cinch of Mr. Dakin' s sad
dle suddenly burst and the horsf he was
(in bolted. There was nothing for the un
fortunate rider io <io but to stay ami at
tempt to keep the affrighted animal in the
middle of thi narrow trail, which was bor
dered on one side by precipitous cliffs and
on the other by precipices ranging from
1200 to in depth. The horse sud
denly turned a sharp corner on the trail,
and Mr. Dakin. saddle and all. was
thrown off on the precipice side. He struck
mi the ground with his logs hanging- over
the side of the rocky wall that stretched
down for nvt-r a thousand feet without
one ledge, shrub or bowlder projecting
from its sides which might have served to
arrest bia progress to eternity had he
been thrown six Inches further.
Dakin' a companion came at once to his
assistance and dragged him to a safer
position, wherr- an examination revealed
the injuries which made the recent trip to
this city a necessity.
Though it will be several weeks befora
Mr. Dakin is entirely well, he considers
himself one to be congratulated rather
than one to be condoled with.

MACKLIN ON
TENRICA IN
GOOD LUCK
The Only Outsider to Score
Two Very Close Fin
ishes at Oakland.
"It looked as if five straight favorites
might win at Oakland yesterday, but
Whaleback broke the slate when Tenrica
led him out. A gale blew over the course,
the track was slow but not muddy, and
the attendance the lightest of the week.
Eddie Jones, astride the favorite, Sy
barite, took the opening six furlong sprint
tor all ages, through superior joekeyship.
Devin, on Major Cook, sifted along out in
front with his mount under restraint to
the Btretch. He then decided to cut away,
but was collared by Jones, and in a long,
hard drive lost the verdict by a nose. My
Dear finished third.
The dash for two-year-olds which fol
lowed, over the Futurity course, resulted
in another nose finish, the favorite. Es
sence, piloted by Thorpe, earning the de
cision. Quickest away from the barrier,
Jones skipped off in the lead with Druid
ess, and it was only by the hardest kind
of riding that Thorpe got up in time to
score. Bamboulia, clumsily rated by
Songer, ran into show. The other start
ers were a ragged assortment.
For the mile event, decided under selling
'â 'Hidition.s, Macklin, on Tenrica, "lucked
in." It was a stubbornly contested affair
from the start, the lield running well
bunched. A furlong from the stand, with
(Vaber astride Monrovia riding hard,
Whaleback, with Thorpe in the saddle,
looked a certainty. Opposite the paddock
the latter ran out just, enough to allow
Mackiii! to squoi-zo through on the rail
with Tenrica, beating the favorite a neck.
Show honors fell to Oraibee.
Outclassing his company shoes to plates,
Pat Morrissey, at prohibitive odds, came
in an easy winner of the six and a half
furlong selling affair. Pat is good enough
to line up with better horses and deserves
no credit for the victory. Socialist led
Wyoming over the line for the place. New
M""!i, again compelled to grapple with
Morrissey, ran well to the stretch, where
she stopped.
Betting on the free handicap, over a
mile, the closing number on the card,
â ff-emed to be nervous and uneven. Mamie
i} closed a clammy ilrst choice, with the
wise ones setting their coin in on Ring
master. Ward, on the favorite, took no
chances from the start. Hustling the
black mare away in the lead, he was
never headed, defeating Snips half a
length, driving hard. A sixteenth from
home Ringmaster swerved in toward the
rail, ruining whatever chance he pos
i of capturing the long end of the
purse.

LOTS MORE RAIN.
Storm in Oregon â Winds in Sacra-

Will Result.

it as his opinion that the ruin will con

ably also lie visited by the severe storm
which is now raging at the mouth of the
Columbia River, where a southeast gale
is blowing at the rate of forty-nine miles
an hour, and may do some damage to
shipping.
The storm is the most severe ever ex*
perienced on the coast at this season. The
whole coast from Point Conception north
is feeling the effects of this blow. Owing
to the wires being down no reports were
received at the Weather Bureau to-night
from Point Reyes. Eureka. Fort Canby,

Rain has fallen all along the coast from

accompanied by sandstorms, while at Sac
ramento they are getting a thirty-mile
blow. These winds will do considerable

The rain has not yet reached Fresno,
but the indications are that it will, and
raisin men have been warned to stack
their trays.

STORY TOLD BY JOHN KNECHT
THE DECEASED FEARFUL OF AN
ARMED ATTACK.
McÃride 111 as the Result of His Icy
Bath but Refuses to Take any
Medicine for His Bet
terment.
John Knecht, a waiter employed In the
restaurant of the ferry-boat Sausalito,
furnished information yesterday throwing
considerable light on the murder of Vin
cent Hurch by Manuel McÃride, the cook,
who had to jump into the bay in order to
pave himself from being lynched by the
Infuriated passengers and deck hands.
According to Knecht, whose story is told
â¢with the confidence of one who is sure
wnereof he speaks, the name of Miss Nel
lie Athron has been dragged into the trag
edy in an unwarranted manner, as it was
the relationship existing between her
mother and the murderous cook that led
to the homicide.

. BLnd Mrs. Athron In England,"

took place Cutting offered an Inducement
to Courtenay by settling an amount an

couple were forced to part this allowance

WHEN IT OCCURRED.
Sad Ending of a Week's Outing in
Search of Big Game in the
Mountains â How It
Happened.
Pr. H. P. Robertson, a well known
practitioner of medicine of this city, sur
cumbed to an operation performed on his
foot at the Waldeck Sanatorium yester
day afternoon. Death was the direct re-
suit of a gunshot wound In the foot, ac
cidentally inflicted by the discharge of
the doctor's gun while hunting in the
ntains of Siskiyou three days ago.
my with Dr. F.
W. Vowinckel, Its. Carpenter and Fish
and Game Warden H. \Y. Keller were in
quest "f bear when the accident occurred.
The party had killed a number of deer
and other game and had reached camp.
Dr. Robertson was putting his hammer
less gun in its place when without warn
ing ii was discharged and the hullet
struck him in the foot and inflicted a bad
wound. His fellow physicians immedl
ately sei about to relieve tho wounded
man, but they found the wound of such
magnitude that they deemed It best to
have the patient removed to the city. It
was a sad party that arrived here A
delightful hunting: tour was cut short by
the accident and the members of the
party were full of sympathy for the in
jured medical man. On their arrival their
patient wan removed to the YValdeek An
attempt was made to save the foot but
it wiis found impossible, as the bullet
known as the â¢'smooth-nosed" or â¢'dum
dum," had spread when it struck the
bone find torn the ligaments to pieces An
operation was decided on yesterday and
I)rs. Fshleisen and Vowincke] and a num
ber of other physicians participated The
patient was put under an anesthetic and
the leg was amputated at the knee The
shock was too much for Dr Robertson
and he did not survive the operation

The proceedings j n the into case yes
terday were enlivened by torrid remarks
between Attorney Foote and Attorney
John A. Wall, who was called as a wit
ness to testify to what he knew of Lucy
Hlte. He did not know much, and what
be did know he said he had received
prim-ipally from a newspaper reporter
Foote tried to show that Wall had used
the information he had so obtained to
break into the case, but the incident ended
in uilk.
The only other witness of the day was

NEWS OF STORM
TOSSED SHIPS
IS COMING IN

Transport Senator Due Here Next
Tuesday â Not a Disengaged
Vessel in â Sewall to
Carry Canned Goods.
The Pacific has been belying Its name of
late. From all quarters come tale,s of
storms, and In many Instances vessels
have suffered. The Empress of India was
caught in a typhoon off the Japanese
coast, and as the Senator, with the lowa
| boys, sailed eight hours ahead of her, she
must have caught it also. The Senator Is
as stout a ship as ever left this port, how
ever, and there Is no doubt that she
has weathered the storm in safety. The
worst that can be expected Is a little de
lay. On her last run from Yokohama to
San Francisco, the Senator took sixteen
days. On this occasion she will probably
take seventeen days, and that would
! make her due here next Tuesday.
Of the other transports on the way here,
the City of Puebla sailed from Kobe,
Japan, on the 17th inst.; the City of Syd
] ney is twenty-three days out from Manila;
j the Ohio, with the Tennessee boys abroad,
sailed from Hongkong on the 2d Inst., and
the St. Paul sailed from Nagasaki on Oc
tober 18.
In the north vessels bound for Cape
Nome have been badly buffeted. The
Aloha is reported to have lost her deck
load, the Bertha had her cabins flooded,
windows broken and doors smashed in,
I while the schoner Llbby had her rudder
| head and main boom carried away and
was towed into TJnalaska by the British
man-of-war Pheasant.
The Bertha arrived at Unalaska from
San Francisco on September 29, and four
days later she sailed again for St.
Michael. The Portland arrived at Un
! Alaska from St. Michaels on September
' 28, and on October 3 sailed for Cape Nome
with a cargo of coal. The schooner Pearl
left Unalaska for St. Michaels on Septem
l ber 20, and the steamer Homer, from
] San Francisco, arrived at Unalaska on
| October 1. All these vessels had a hard
' time of it in the North Pacific
Another message from the steamer Peli
can was received at the Merchants' Ex
change yesterday. It was written on a
piece of paper torn from a memorandum
book, and after being placed in a bottle
â was thrown overboard. It was picked up
: on the extreme end of the Aleutian Isl
! ands. 'The message read: "Steamer Peli-
I canâShip is sinking; ten minutes more
| and all will be lost." Once before a mes
sage from the steamer was washed
ashore. It was from Mate Patterson and
was to the same effect as the above. The
' Pelican left Puget Sound nearly a year
j ago with a general cargo for the Orient.
A thorough search was made for the
1 remains of Will A. Snow, the marine re
porter of the Chronicle who lost his life
oft Black Point a week ago. The tug
Governor Perkins, with Chancellor Snow,
i father of the dead man, and a representa
i tive of the Chronicle, was out for several
1 hours, while Peterson's launch Sybil was
out from morning till night. Alcatraz,
Angel Island, Sausallto, Fort Point, the
marine shore and way up the bay as far
; as Hunter's Point the boats cruised, but
not a trace of the body could be found.
i A number of Whitehall boats were also
I out. The search will be continued to-day.
For the first time In the history of the
port there was not a disengaged vessel on
the list yesterday. Everything has been
chartered and still there is not enough to
meet the demand. The sugar fleet cannot
carry all the merchandise destined for
Honolulu and lumber orders cannot be
filled for want of vessels. Yesterday the
bark Nicholas Thayer was hauled out of
Oakland Creek and will go in ballast to
Clipperton to load guano. The gasoline
schooner Bessie X will accompany the
Nicholas Thayer.
The big American ship Arthur Sewall
will take a most valuable cargo to Lon
don. Besides a quantity of wheat, she
will carry 150,000 cases of canned goods.
Some of the rivets In the bow of the
ship worked loose during the voyage to
San Francisco, and a gang of riveters has
been engaged in making good the defects.
The Sewall goes on the drvdock to be
cleaned and painted before beginning to
load.
An ex-weigher in the Custom House had
a narrow escape from drowning at Broad
way wharf yesterday. He missed his foot-
Ing and fell Into the bay. Had it not been
for the prompt assistance of Customs In
spector Stevens and Officer McGreevy he
would have been drowned. They got him
out of the -water and aent him home In a
hack.
Rough on the Bay.
It was blowing a southeast gale at the
Heads yesterday afternoon, and in con
sequence a number of vessels that were
to have sailed remained in port. The
Walla Walla was due from Victoria, B.
C, early in the morning, but ran into a
southeast storm directly she passed out
of the Straits of Juan de Fuca, and it
must have stayed with her all the way
down the coast, as she was not in sight
at sundown.
The Townsend was to have sailed for St.
Georges Island after the cargo of tho
wrecked Laurada, but her departure was
delayed until to-day.
Vessels moored at the southerly end of
the water front suffered from the gale
The City of Peking chafed a little at the
Mail dock, and the City of Papeete had
a lively time of it at Hathaways. An
attempt was made to get her out into the
stream, but It failed. She will dock at
Vnllcjo street to-day. A number of lum
ber schooners discharging at Main and
Little Main had to move out Into the
stream, and some of the colliers at Beale
.street followed suit.

yesterday afternoon and evening by the
presence of a bazaar and entertainment

The" church, which is small and modest
in pretensions, has so increased in regu
lar Sunday attendance since the advent of
its new pastor, Rev. R. W. Reynolds, that
it ifl probable additional room will be
required soon. Before this is attempted,
however, the present small indebtedness
will be paid off, and it is with this object
that the ladies have exerted them
selves in collecting such fancy articles as
< can be disposed of at a bazaar, together
with the giving of a real old-fashioned
New England dinner this afternoon be
tween 5:30 and 7:30 o'clock. Previous to
the dinner hour there will be a musicale,
in which Â°ome of the best local talent ob
tainable in the Mission will participate.
In the Sabbath School and parlors of
I the church there are several booths.
I Among the more prominent are: "T+ie
I American booth," in which Admiral
Dewev figures in the form of a plaster
bust in a most conspicuous place. Over
this booth Mrs. Arthur Davis presides,
assisted by Mrs. E. Kohler. Mrs. I. Mc-

ENGLISH LIBERTY. .
A DAILY study of current events in Great
Britain may be useful to Americans. Our
domestic imperialists have for more than a
year urged Americans to consider the glory of Brit
ish arms, the richness of British conquests, the wide
scope of British trade and the merits of British policy
in the crown colonies. This has been done to lead
i copying the imperial policy of that country,
regardless of the fact that while it conforms to the
British constitution it is repugnant to ours. The
institutions of a constitutional empire can be ex
tended by force. The free institutions of a constitu
tional republic cannot be extended by force.
American anti-imperialists have now the right to
call the attention of their countrymen to the tolerance
of opposition in Great Britain. While the Chicago
Tribune is calling for the arrest and execu
tion of Carl Schurz, J. Sterling Morton,
George H. Boutwell and Bishop Potter as
traitors because they declare that self-govern
ment ceases to be self-government when it is
forced upon an unwilling people, in Great Britain
subjects of great eminence, members of Parliament
in the Lords and Commons, are not checked nor re
buked for their expressions of dissent from the pol
icy that has forced the war on the two South African
republics. It is a strange situation. While Ameri
can imperialist newspapers are telling our citizens
that it is unpatriotic in them to express sympathy
for the Boers, Englishmen in all walks of life are
showing sympathy and freely expressing it.
In this we do not refer to the Irish members of
the Hou-e of Commons, who habitually go to the
extremes in criticism of England that seem to be war
ranted by seven centuries of oppression to their
country. They stand apart from the Englishmen
who arraign the policy of Chamberlain and Cecil
Rhodes. Mr. Stanhope. Mr. Evans and Sir William
Vernon Harcourt, in the Commons, have announced
that while they will support the Government in the
prosecution of "this unhappy war," they regaod it
as unjustified and wrong.
Harcourt said: "The British nation has a right
to know what the proposals of the Government are.
The Government has no right to involve the nation
in a war in the dark. I disassociate myself altogether
from responsibility of any kind for the measures
which have led to this war, though I am prepared to
support the Government in the unhappy conflict in
which we are engaged." Mr. Stanhope, of one of the
most distinguished families of England, which has
furnished soldiers and sailors and scholars to build
up the glory of Great Britain, said: "The British
High Commissioner in South Africa, Sir Alfred
Milner. is lacking in the qualities necessary to a dip
lomat in his position. I am convinced that the Sec
reu.ry of State for the Colonies and the British Pligh
Commissioner have for the last two years been fully
determined that war and war only should end this
crisis, and that they have worked for this consum
mation during the last year."
In this position there is a lot of hard-headed Eng
lish sen-e and that kind of sturdy patriotism which
may have to interfere to r-ave the empire from itself.
rlishmen are not misled by specious talk
about destiny and the Providence of God. They pro
to <!ra.c into daylight the machinations which
have involved the country in war.
They are patriots of the style of Charles James
Fox. who during the American Revolution said in
the Commons: "The noble Lord who moved the
amendment said that we were in the dilemma of
conquering or abandoning America. If we are re
duced to that lam for abandoning America. I c^n
not^Â«onscienti(!us!y agree to grant any money for so
destructive, so ignoble a purpose as the carrying
on of a war commenced unjustly and rted with
no other view than to the extirpation of free I
They have th< Imund Burke, who in
Parliament said: "You simply teil the American
colonists to lay down their arms, and then you will
do just as yon please. Could the most cruel
queror say k-ss? Had [uered the devil him
self in hell con. iberal?" â 
They are Englishmen like Chatham, whose son
resigned his commission in the army rather than
fight against self-government in America, and who
said in the House of Lords in the second year of our
Revolution: "We have tried for unconditional sur
render; try what can be gained by unconditional
redress. This country has been the aggressor. You
have made descents upon their coasts; you have
burned their towns, plundered their country, made
war upon the inhabitants, confiscated their property,
proscribed and imprisoned their persons. I do there
fore affirm that, instead of exacting unconditional
surrender from the colonies, we should grant tliem
unconditional redress. I would sell the shirt off my
back to assist in proper measures, properly and wisely
conducted; but I wo\ild not part with a single
shilling to the present Ministers. TheirJ plans are
founded in destruction and disgrace. It is, my Lords,
a ruinous and destructive war; it is full of dangers;
it teems with disgrace and must end in ruin. If I
were an American a> I am an Englishman while a
foreign troop was landed in my country I would
never lay down my arms! Never! never! never!"
A session of the American Congress is approach
ing. Let us hope that it will vindicate the belief that
American liberty of expression is no less than that
liberty was in England a century and a quarter ago,
and no less than it is now.
THE SITUATION IN CUBA.
GENERAL WILSON'S report to the War De
partment on the situation in the provinces of
Matanzas and Santa Clara, in Cuba, which are
under his command, affords nothing of encourage
ment to the annexation schemers. The General de
chres the provinces are orderly and free from dis
turbances. "The Cubans," he says, "have received us
everywhere, and at all times, with every evidence of
friendship, and in most localities with a cordiality that
indicates genuine gratitude. The Cuban army has
given no trouble: it maintained order until relieved
of the responsibility. It? members had generally been
disbanded and gone to work before the United States
sent out its paymasters with the money allotted to
them from the treasury. One newspaper at Cien
fuegos. claiming to speak for the Cuban army, but
actually the mouthpiece of a few dissatisfied officers,
has been at times incendiary in its utterances, but the
department is absolutely tranquil, life and property
are safe, and there is probably less crime and disorder
here than in any State in the Union."
Commenting upon such evidences of discontent as
arc to be found he says: "The feeling of unrest in
these two provinces is due mainly to the suspicion
that we do not intend to live up to the voluntary
pledge contained in the joint resolution of interven
tion. This feeling is, perhaps, on the increase, and
is encouraged by political agitators and newspapers.
So far as I can discover, the Cuban people in the
provinces of this department are now as ready for
self-government as they are likely to be at any time
in the near future. It is my deliberate judgment that
any other course will involve unnecessary delay, and
THE SAN FRANCISCO CAI/L, FRIDAY, OCTOBER 20, 1899.
will be accompanied by a further de-crease of .that
feeling of friendship and gratitude which the Cuban
people now entertain toward the United States, as
well as by a lack of confidence in the business future,
and by a continuance of the depression in the agri
cultural and commercial interests of the island, if not,
indeed, by an actual increase of local disorder."
i So strong a statement coming from an official of
such rank ought to have much effect in counteracting
the ambitions and the greeds of the men who would
like the United States to break faith in order to bring
about the annexation of Cuba. Since the people de
sire self-government and are fitted for it, and since
the only cause of unrest is the fear that we intend to
deprive them of it, the best policy we can pursue in
the matter is to be true to our traditions and our
principles. We entered upon the war with the
avowed purpose of making Cuba free and should do
that as promptly as possible.

THE NEED OF MORE SHIPPING
SHOULD any new argument be needed to urge
Congressional action in favor of American
shipping it can be found in the circumstances
of the time. The demand for transports by the
United States for the Philippine service and by
Great Britain for service in carrying troops and
munitions of war to the Transvaal has so reduced the
available tonnage of the merchant marine of the two
countries that there is a scarcity of ships for the re
quirements of commerce, and as a consequence the
rates of ocean freights have advanced.
Recent advices are to the effect that the advance in
British grain rates on the Atlantic since the Trans
vaal war began has been six cents a bushel. That
means of course our people will receive that much
less profit from the grain they send abroad. That
much of increased tax for transportation purposes
has been placed upon the output, and nearly the
whole of it goes to European ship-owners, for they
carry upward of 90 per cent of our total imports and
exports.
If such be the result of a contest between Great
Britain and a small inland country like the Trans
vaal, it is easy to foresee that the effect upon our
commerce and our industries of a war between the
British and some great power would be tremen
dously disastrous. With our ocean carrying trade in
the hands of foreigners we are exposed to risks in
every foreign war. Anything which diminishes the
available merchant ships of those nations would be
| almost as hurtful to us as to them. .
Our experience during the war with Spain showed
how important to a nation it is to have a merchant
marine of sufficient extent to render transportation
service to the Government when the emergencies of
war make it necessary. Notwithstanding the Spanish
war was comparatively slight, the United States was
sorely hampered by lack of transports. It would
have been a serious impediment indeed had Spain
been in condition to wage a longer or a more deter-
mined resistance to our arms.
All these recent experiences point to the one con
clusion. The upbuilding: of an American merchant
marine is not a mere matter of sentiment, but a work
rendered imperatively necessary by the conditions
of the time. The peace of Europe is by no means se
cure. There is no telling when war may break out.
It is folly, therefore, to leave our commerce exposed
to the hazard of such wars. It must be remembered
that the welfare of almost every one of our indus
tries depends on commerce. A rise in the rates of
ocean transportation is a tax on the producers of
all staple articles and on all sorts of exports. There
is but one safe course to pursue. Our industries and
our commerce should be rendered independent by
the prompt upbuilding of a merchant marine ade
quate to all the needs of our people.
AT the time the conservative Democratic leaders
were making such vigorous efforts last sum
mer to devise a platform and find a leader
for a united Democracy, there was a good deal of
speculation as to what the gold standard Democrats
: would do in the States where elections are to be held
this fall. What course they would have pursued had
the movement toward harmony met .with any success
it is of course impossible to say, but as it is the fol
lowers of Palmer and Buckner in 1896 appear to have
decided to cut loose from Democracy altogether for
a time at least and to vote a straight Republican
ticket.
Mr. James Caren of Ohio, who was chairman of
I the State committee of the sound money Democrats
I during the Bryan campaign, having been asked re
cently what he thinks the gold Democrats of that
State will do in this contest, is reported to have said:
"I would say that fully 80 per cent of them will vote
for Judge Nash. They say to us that this is a State
I campaign, and the money question should not be per
: mitted to cut any figure. That is possibly true, but
the campaign in Ohio this year is being fought on
national issues, one of which, as raised in the Demo
cratic State platform, is free and unlimited coinage
of silver at the ratio of 16 to 1, independent of all
I the other nations of the. earth, and the demand for
\ the renomination of Bryan as the Democratic stan
dard bearer in 1900. The one thing to be consid
ered is the important bearing an adverse result to
i the national administration this year in Ohio would
have upon the great national contest next year, with
j Bryan as the Democratic candidate and free silver
the issue." "
In Maryland so large a proportion of the sound
money Democrats are in favor of acting with the
Republican party in the campaign that a movement
has been started to organize them as an active and
effective force in the contest. The gold Democrats
well understand that a Democratic victory this year
would put their party organization and the State
patronage under the control of the Bryan faction. It
w.uld then be extremely difficult to win a sound
money victory in the Presidential campaign of next
year. They are not going to take such chances, and
accordingly will join hands with the Republicans for
the redemption of the State.
Such a course on the part of the sound money
Democrats is the inevitable consequence of the com
plete failure of all attempts to get rid of the Bryanite
leadership in their own party. It is now evident the
silver men have control of the Democratic machina
and of the Democratic masses. Men who understand
: the importance of sound finance and who are opposed
to intrusting the affairs of the nation to such irre
sponsible men as are now at the head of Democracy
can no longer act with that organization even in
State issues. Until Bryanism has been eliminated
irom our politics all conservative citizens must stand
together. There is no place for a side faction. The
only way to make sure of sound finance is to vote
for the Republican party and uphold it in every
â  election that comes, whether national, State or
i municipal.
This promises to be a good year to'start the move
ment for the storage of flood waters, for all prospects
point to the conclusion there will be an abundance of
it to experiment with.

IN THE POLITICAL ARENA
HORACE DAVIS
FORCES AHEAD
IN THE FIGHT
Desertions From the
Democratic Camp.
Candidates on the McXab municipal
ticket are keeping a sharp eye on Mayor
Flielun's particular partisans in order to
detect the first signs of knifing in favor
of the head of the ticket. The manipu
lators of the McNab convention want the
whole works, but in the event of extreme
peril will sacrifice subordinate positions in
orai-r to grasp the greÂ«u power of patron
age which the new charter vests in the
Mayor.
The election of Phelan will entrench the
Committee of Cue Hundred and fasten 1
on the city of San Francisco a predatory
band of job chasersâ the rawest lot of
greedy tax-eaters that ever feasted at j
the public crib. As an illustration of the I
raw work of the One Hundred, the fact j
may be cited that the ticket indorsed by |
the Pnelan-McNab convention was slated
as early as September 15â three weeks be- j
fore the delegates to the convention in- i
dorsed the slate. The leading patronage
positions on ihe ticket were given to the
Old followers of the Committee of One I
Hundred. The of September 15 pub- !
Ushed the slate, as Democrats may aacer- !
tain by reference to the files of this
paper.
Jt is needless to remind Democrats who
admire parts fealty that Phelan was
I last November at the sacrifice of i
Judge Maguire, the Democratic nominee I
for Governor. The friends of Maguire In |
this campaign may retaliate by tending
their support to Dr. Cleveland, the can-;
didate tor Mayor on the People's party i
-Many Democrats entertain the belief !
that thre election of Horace Davis would I
be better : r thi i ause of true Democracy
than the success of Phelan and the per
petuation "t' the Committee of One iiun
dr< ii. The Phelanits are Bhouting that
national issues should not be considered
in this municipal campaign, t>ut every In
: ral knows that McNab
and Phelan have, grasped the reins of the
cratic party in order to control the
organization through the agency of j
the Committee of One Hundred in liÂ»0o.
r i :-.-â¢ non-partisan note is uttered to de- j
ceive Republicans.
i'esteraay Information was received
by the Republican Campaign Committee
that the Democratic club at 808 Capp I
street, Thirty-fifth Assembly District.
bad resolved to support Horace Davis for
Mayor. 'i he president of the club is
es Worden and the secretary Carl

In ihe Thirty-first Assembly District
there is a movement among non-partisan
mil' hauts tr> organize a Horace Davis
Club. Many of the grocerymen purchas

mercani He liberality.
There v. ill be a meeting of the execu

ern Addition desire to attend the big
rally at Metropolitan Hall.
The outlook fur Republican success
grows Ihlklh.t as the contest proceeds.
Hundreds of Republicans who gave their
support to Phelan at two elections open
ly signify their purpose to work and voti
"or Horace Davis. They simply declare
that Mr. Davis is a clean, capable leader
against whose character as a public man
and private citizen nothing can be uttered
and who. as hi Is a Republican, is en
tlued to the support of Republicans
The Republican committ.e on purity

bimmons, vice president; Gus Casner, sec
retary.
DODGE FELT BADLY.
Assessor Told a Democratic
Auiience That He Has
Been Abused.
Mayor Phelan talked to his Democratic
neighbors out at the Mission last evening
He did not talk to all of them, for all of
them did not turn out to listenâ fact,
the number of vacant chairs in Mission
Parlor Hall was almost as great as the
seats that were occupied. The Mayor did
not address his home constituents until
after he had finished explaining matters
to the voters of the Fortieth District
In the meantime the audience was held
by some spell-binding effusions from thÂ»
other Democratic candidates, including
Franklin Lane and Washington bode*
All of them admitted that they were the
best men that the voters could select to
run the city's affairs under the new
charter. Not one of them denied that he
was Buffering to get into office
Dr. Dodge put a coating of frost on
whatever enthusiasm there was in the
audience previous to the arrival of the
Mayor. He brought his portable black
board with him and explained what a
perfect Assessor lie had been and would
continue to be If re-elect* d, and the au
dience slept. Nothing was just right but
himself, according to the Assessor's
statements. He said that the whole sys
tem of taxation was wrong, unjust and
arbitrary. Personal property gave him
the nightmare, because he could not lo
cate more than 10 per cent of it when he
felt it his duty to locate at least 50 pÂ°r
cent. "Why. the people of this city have
only. two millions of ready cash, accord
ing to their statements to the Assessor
The banks have thirty-six million; to the
credit of depositors, and who thai other
thirty-four millions belong to is some
thing that has been puzzling me."
The Mayor appeared during this inter
esting part of the Assessor's address and
the audience sought relief in applauding
(heir standard bearer. When Dr. Dodge
came up for the second inning he paid his
compliments to The Call, Baying that the
paper had hit him below the belt when
he felt that he deserved being patted on
the back.
Mr. Phelan's speech was not a long
one, but contained some startling an
nouncements. While claiming all the
credit for the framing and adoption of
the new charter for the Democratic
party he did not neglect to assert that he
was' the only one entitled to enforce It
at the start off. ,
"This Is a business and not a political
campaign," he said. "The administration
or the war in the Philippines has nothing
to do with it. If McKinley came out
here and told you what you should pay
for your gas you would tell him to go
home and mind his own business. The
Republicans are making a desperate ef
fort to force national politics into this
campaign. They have no local p Â»Hey
and dare not come into the arena with
us. The people have no confidence in
them, for they are affiliated with the
grinding corporations. They are more
loyal to their friends than they are to the
city.
"Few of us can survive the atmosphere
of the City Hall. The continual charges
by the newspapers of the ..influences
brought to bear on the officials by the gas
companies and the water corporation
in many cases with good foundation
bring about a bad state of feeling
among the people and force them to
occasionally purge the entire City Hall."
Suffered a Hemorrhage.
Clarence Gray, a well known Police
Court practitioner, Buffered a severe
hemorrhage <>f the lungs at his resilience
(>4l Kddy street, last evening and was
taken to the Receiving Hospital, where
he now lies in a precarious condition. Dr.
McGettigan, the attending physician, has
Uttle hope for his recovery.
EXTRA SESSION
POSTPONED FOR
A SHORT TIME
Gage, Herrin and
Burns Confer.
Advocate? of an extra session of the
Legislature maintain that the proclama
tion calling the members together will oe
issued about the middle of next month.
Two weeks ago Governor Gage, W. F.
Jlerrin and D. M. Burns held a confer
ence in this city and discussed the extra
session subject. The Governor favored a
postponement <>f the matter until Nu
vember Bâ the day of the municipal elec
tion In San Francisco.
(The point was raised that if the extra
session proclamation should be issued be
fore the municipal election, and if by
any chance the local contest should re
sult in Democratic advantage, the Re
publlcan Governor would be held ac
countable for thai result It is said that
the proposition t>> postpone was not re
sisted by Herrin and Burns.
ThÂ«- Â«'ali therefore predicts again that
the Governor will call an extra session of
the Legislature, although It is possible
that another postponement of the sub
ject may be taken to ascertain the sen
timent of the mr nl ted States Senate re
garding the admission of Quay on ere
! dentials of appointment by the Governor
of Pennsylvania.
D. M. Burns has not abandoned all hope
of election by the California Legislature
:in extra session. The claim is made by
! his followers that he can secure the sup-
I port of several members of the Legisla
i ture who voted for Grant at the last
-session, but as far as The Call is able
to ascertain Assemblyman Huber is the
only Grant man that has manifested any
i inclination to support Burns. On tho
: other hand, information comes that
I several members who voted for Burns
last winter have resolved to jump the
corral because they were thrown down
or "gold bricked" in the distribution of
promised State patronage. Gage is said
to be a little lukewarm toward Burns.
Major McLausrhlin is not so enthusiasti
cally in favor of thr Mexican as he was
last winter at Sacramento. Herrln is not
sure that Huntington will authorize the
law department of the corporation to en
-1 gaere in another Senatorial contest in
blundering opposition to the wishes of the
i people. By reason of these distressing
complications the Mexican's chances of
ess hnve not improved.
There is gossip in Southern California
thai Judge Fitzgerald of Los Angeles,
formerly Attorney General of California,
may be brought forward as a candidate
i at the extra session.
PHELAN AND DEMOCRACY
The Mayor Tells Republicans
That the Campaign Is oimply
a Non- Partisan Struggle
of Good Citizens.
The Democrats of the Fortieth Assem
bly District opened their ratification
meeting lasi night to the ominous strains
of "Just us the Sun Went Down." Syd
ney Van Wyck was introduced as the
chairman oÂ£ the evening. He consider
ately declined to make a speech on the
ground that he is a good Democrat.
With that consoling assurance he pre
sented Mr. Osgood Putnam as the first
speaker of the evening. Mr. Putnam
consumed considerable time in telling his
hearers what Bplendld men are associated
with him on the Democratic Supervisor
ial ticket. As an aid to his memory
the speaker frequently referred to a
printed list of the names of the nomi
nees. One would suspect that the orator
was an auctioneer, so eloquently <l!d he
recite the virtues of his fellow aspirants.
K. I. Doolan was the next speaser and
entertained the audience with a some
what dreary autobiography. He promises
that he will be the best Tax Collector
ever elected. Lewis P. Byington follow
ed, and beyond tangling his feet in a
logical absurdity said nothing of more
than passing interest. He declared that
this is a campaign where men and not
principles are to be supported, and upon
the heels of that assertion he insisted
that the charter and not men is the great
Issue of the tight. Alfred J. Fritz was
given an opportunity to say that three of
the nominees for Police Judge are abso
lutely beyond reproach, and he will try
to be if given a chance. P. J. Curtis
â  -iled him and confined himself to
general praise of the ticket and a plea
tor success. The oft-repeated cry of the
charter was evidently beginning to pall,
At this point Mayor Phelan entered the
hall and was pres< nted, In the midst of
cl rs. as the next Bpeaker, As tne
Fortieth District is overwhelmingly Re
publican, the Mayor adapted his remarks
to the circumstances. In the Twenty
eighth District he knew nothing but I de
mocracy. Last night he knew no political
issues in this campaign. He knew neither
Republicans nor Democratsâ only good
citizens Interested in municipal issues in
dependent of political divisions. He said
he knew in this campaign only two
parties, that which is against the* policy
he represents and that which supports his
principles. So he called upon all to vote
the Democratic ticket, which in this
struggle is in reality a non-partisan party,
whose n< minces will know no party but
that of progress. Having made this' plea,

1. SAMUEL ADAMS.
By BERNARD C. STEIXER, PH. D.
To no one docs the cause of American
independence owe more than to this man
who with, invincible persistence and
shrewd farsightedness so conducted the
cause of those among the colonists who
opposed the taxation of Americans by the
British Parliament that a majority of all
the British subjects in each colony were :
willing to unite in declaring their inde
pendence from all foreign rule. He was a
typical puritan, upright, firm, determined,
religious, devoted to his cause, somewhat
narrow, but with the narrowness of the
sharp-edged sword. He was above all
else a politicianâ a professional and prac
tical politician. His early ventures in
business were unsuccessful. Ills malt I
house was soon closed, his tax collector-1
ship left him involved in debt, and, Jiv-I
ing on the small remains of his fath<r'sl
estate, he devoted the remainder of nisi
days to political life. Adams was of un-l
blemished in;"Kn:y.^^^^^^^^l
His means were sol
narrow that his fru-H
gal and devoted wifeH
was at times called
upon to aid in the
support of the fam-
ily, and he was in
debted to. friends for
the clothes he wore,
yet no temptation to
amass wealth ever
touched him. He
was ahove bribery or
influence by money.
Adams was a faith-
j ful son of MaFfÃ
i chusetts nnd Boston.
Until he went to the
j continental congress.
lln 1774, he seems
never to have left
his native State, nor
j Indeed to have ever
; prone any distance
I from his residence.
j Except for his jour
neys to attend the
various congresses
of which he was a
member, he seems
never to have gone
from home. Others
might hold fore'ern
embassies: for him
Boston was all-suf
ficient. Tn Boston his Influence was long \
supreme. The royalist Governor of Mas
sachusetts colony rightly called him "the
grand incendiary of the province." fur the
whole of Massachusetts was set on fin
by the Boston town meeting, and the
moderator and master of that meeting
w.is Samuel Adams. He did not enter
into public life early, but from 17C>. when
ho was first elected as a representa'ive
from Boston to the Great and General i
Court, to 1797. when he resigned the
Governorship of the State, his whole time
was devoted to th'> service of the people.
It was noted that he cared not '
social, scientific or religious matters with
friends; all his thoughts were on politics.
and in old atr.- his favorite theme was the
struggle with Great Britain, in which he
haÂ«l borne so groat a part. Upright him- i
self he insisted on civic virtue anrl strove
to draw promisng and able young men
into public service. His kinsman. John
Adams, and John Hancock, whose wealth
and social position were of great va.ue .
to the colonists, were two of those he j
introduced into politics.
Through a long career we find but little
to criticize in his actions from a moral
point of view. He was doubtless some
: what disingenuous in his treatment of the
letters of Governor Hutchinson and in
some of his arguments, but the wonder is
rather that in the heat of controversy he
was swayed so little from the path of ab
solute rectitude.
He cared not for personal advancement
and seemed to feel little bitterness when
the people set him aside for a time. Adams
trusted the people and believed that their
decisions as to men were right. To influ
ence their derisions as to measures he ap-
plied himself with the utmost vigor.
He was born in 1722 and was educated at
Harvard College, wrVere he took his bach
elor's degree in 1740 and his master's de
gree in 1743. Tt was afterward remem- !
berÂ«d, as a presage of his future, that his
master's thesis was an affirmative an
swer to the question. "Whether it be law
ful to resist the supreme magistrate, if |
the commonwealth cannot be otherwise
preserved."
When 2Â»: years of age he began furnish- ;
ing to the newspapers the first of that
long series of articles on government
which had so much effect. His style of ;
writing was clear and incisive, his argu- ;
ments were forcible and logical. Adams j
used few metaphors and quotations, his
writings were not graceful, but they w^re
never dull and they were always convinc
ing.
Adams always took a deep interest in
popular education, and his first public of- 'â 
fice was that of school visitor, to which
he was appointed in 1753. His whole
course of effort against Great Britain
was what we would call a "campaign of
education." He appeared chiefly to the [
iniellerts of bis fellow-citizens, though he
â  was too skillful to omit altogether the
| appeal to emotions. When the stamp act
! showed the policy of Great Britain to
j ward America he drafted his first public
i paper, a series of instructions to the peo-
J pie's representatives, adopted by the Bos
' ton town meeting May 21, 1764. He stood
i steadfastly for the principle of no taxa
tion without representation, and, unlike
â¢ Otis, discerned from the first that repre
sentation of any sort in the British Par
; liament was impracticable. In these early
resolutions he claims that tho stamp tax
"annihilates our charter rights to govorn
i and tax ourselves. It strikes at our Brit- â 
I ish privileges, which, as we have never
I forfeited them, we hold in common with
j out fellow subjects who are natives of
j Britain. If taxes are laid upon us in any
â¢ shape without our having a legal repre
sentation where they are laid we are re
duced from the character of subjects to
' the miserable state of tributary slave.?."
Adams advanced from this position bo as
to maintain, in 1773, that Parliament had
! no right to legislate for the colonies in
I America. The attempt of^the British to \
â  seize him and Hancock just before the
battle of Lexington was not a mistaken
one. He had been the very forefront of j
i opposition.
Adnms was prudent enough to see from
the very flrtt that Boston alone, or even
the whole of Massachusetts, could not en
dure successfully" the burden of the strug
gle with England. To secure even the
hope of success the co-operation of all
the other colonies was urressnry. In the
resolutions 'â !" I7< ; -!. to whir-h we have re-
ferred, the necessity of united effort is
Btated thus: "As his Majesty's other
North American colonies are embarked
with us in this most important bottom,
we further desire you to use your en
deavors that their weight may be -.<â 
to that of this province that, by the
united application of all who are ag
grieved, all may obtain redress." This
Insistence on the Importance of united
action was never lost by Adams. Ho oon
tinued to struggle for it. In I7Â«g he in
duced the Legislature to send a circular
letter to the other colonies. Massachu
setts was the chief offender, but she
struggled for a principle whose Impor
tance was equal to atrHhe colonies. We
! must never think of the colonies as actu
ally Buffering from oppression, though the
I strong language of their documents often
state thai aa a f;ict. What Adams strug
gled against was the validity of a doc
trine which would make oppression pos
sible. In that struggle he often thought
thai in t his time*of common distress it
would he the wisdom of the colonists
more frequently to correspond with and
to b( more attentive to the particular cir
cumstances of each other. "It seems of
late to have been the policy of the ene
mi< s of America to point their artillery
against one province only and artfully to
draw nff the attention of the other colo
nies, and. if possible, to render that single
province odious to them, while it is suf
fering ministerial vengeance for the sake
of the common cause. But it is to he
hoped that the colonists will be aware
of this artifice. At this juncture an at
tempt to subdue one province to despotic
power Is justly to be considered as an at
tempt to enslave the whole. The colo-
SAMUEL ADAMS.
ntes form one political body, of which
each is a member. The liberties of the
whole aru invalid, there-fore the interest
of the whole to support each individual
with all their weight and influence."
As the clouds thickened his masterly re
sistance to the ill-judged British policy
waa continued and the skill with which
he managed the colonial cause, keeping
within constitutional measures, was clear
ly shown. His newspaper articles, pub
lished as was the custom of the day under
somi such norn de piume as "Candide,"
did much to crystallize the opposition. His
idanj and biographi r. Wells, rightly
calls him "the true father of democracy
In America, whose Voice and pen were em
ployed for the common people; and he
labored to build up American liberty, not
by public measures, but by cultivat
ing an Individual independence of thought
among the working classes as the true
basis of national freedom." So successful
was he- in his control of the people and so
j well did he wield his power, that in 1770
Hutehlnson was obliged to withdraw from
town to the fort in the harbor the two
British regiments which had been en
gaged in that unfortunate affray known
as the Boston massacre. In the same year,
through his influence, the Assembly ap
pointed a committee of correspondence
"to communicate such intelligence as may
be necessary to the agent and others in
Great Britain, and also to the Speakers
of the several Assemblies through the
continent, or to such committee of cor
respondence as they have or may ap
point." This idea was still further carried
out by the more famous resolution of the
town of Boston in November, 1772, ap
pointing a like committee to "state the
rights of the colonists, and of this prov
ince in particular, as men and Christians
and subjects, and to communicate pub
licly the same to the several towns and
to the world, as the sense of this town,
with the infringements and violations
thereof that have been or from time to
time may be made." So strong was his
longing for confederation of all America
that he always sought to include Canada
in the continental combination.
The destruction of the tea in Boston
harbor was managed by Adams, and when
the port bill closed that harbor Adams
acted as the chairman of the committee
to distribute the donations which came
so generously from the other States. He
was a chosen member of the lirst Con
tinental Congress, and served in that body
for seven years, or nearly until the end of.
the war. Earliest of all the colonists he
longed for independence, and at one time,
discouraged by the slow progress of the
other colonies toward the acceptance of
that idea, he thought of a separate inde
pendent confederation of the New Eng
land colonies. He won, however, and had
tile joy of seeing the adoption of the reso
lution for independence introduced by his
friend, R. H. Lee.
With the achievement of independence
his chief work was done. There were still
twenty years of useful service ahead of
him, however. He was one of those who
prepared the articles of confederation,
and, in his service on the Marine Board,
Ulil much to build up the navy, for whose
needs, as well as for his State's interests,
he insisted on our preservation of our
rights to the Newfoundland fisheries. He
served at home, in his absence from Con
gress, as Secretary of State, and when the
State's constitution was prepared he sat
as a useful member of the convention.
After retiring from Congress we find him
in the Massachusetts Senate as strong an
opponent of Great Britain as ever and
bitter against allowing the Tories to re
turn. He was classed as an anti-Federal
ist, yet was convinced that the people
desired the adoption of the Federal con
stitution, and voted therefor in the rati
fying convention, while proposing amend
ments in the form of a bill of rights. He
was a stanch supporter of law and order
in the turbulent times of Shay's rebellion.
The people of Massachusetts honored him
to the last. A long standing disagree
ment between himself and Hancock was
made up in 17S8, and, after serving as
Councilor and Lieutenant Governor, he
succeeded to the Governorship in 1793, at
Hancock's death. By successive re-elec*
lions he held the post until 1797, when he
retired from public life. He died on Oc
tober 2. ]n'>3, having "through a long life
exhibited." as one of his friends said,
"on all occasions an example of patriot
ism, religion and virtue honorable to the
human character." ,

"The hide lousiness has bern very active
<Jur!rK th- past month, and sales have been
ir.a'de liberally at full prices. V, - e might say
that the ilide market shows to-day higher
values than ever before known In the history
of the Hide trade. The general business In
raw matt-rial is very active, an.l hides there
fore follow the trend of the general market
and are pushed up to very liberal figures.
The present values will probably last until
the long-haired and winter hides are coming
in As such hides make a smaller percent
age of leather than tht- summer Hides, values
naturally will be a triile lower. We do not,
however, look for any special decline in the
market for some time to come. Tanners are
bu>inK freely and there are no stocks of
Hides on the'market. Harness, skirting and
enie leather have been sold in quantity at fair
prices, and the better grades of Hides, those
that are well taken care of and in good con
dition, command high figures. Wet salted
heavy strers are in demand for harness and
Fole;Â» leather. Wet Falted medium and light
steers s'?ll freely. Wet salted cows bring full
prices. Wet salted kip. veal and calf are
firm and rule at liberal values. Pry Hides
during the past month have shown advancing
rates, as the markets In New York and Bos

EASTERN MARKETS
rk Stock Market.
NEW YORK, Oct. 19. âThe stock market
showed signs of continued strength during the
early part of the trailing and the covering
movement among a large outstanding bear in
terest continued in active force. The profes
sional opponents of the bears did all they could
to take the marktt away from them by bid
ding up prices, picking out Individual stocks
for that purpose to increase the appearance of
Ftrength in the market. As the demand from
the hears fell off later in the day, the fact
began to emerge that there was no very eager
demand for stocks amung the public at large
and prices began to clip downward. Seeing the
hesitancy of the advance, the bears took re
newed courage and put out new short lines.
The fall in prices was considerably acceler
ated during the last hour, and the demand to
cover at the decline was sufficient to cause
only a feeble rally. The closing was barely
Steady and the earlier gains were practically
all wiped out. The Call in prices from the top
level reached a point or over In a large num
ber of prominent railroad stocks, and in some
of the industrial specialties ranged from one
to over three points. The railroads running
through the southern region came Into some
prominence late In the day on account of the
general activity and prosperity of business In
that locality and tne relatively larger increases
In earnings shown by its railroads. Illinois
Central. Louisville and Nashville, Southern
Railway preff-rred. Norfolk and Western pre
ferred and Chesapeake and Ohio all showed
benefit frum this cause, an the gains estab
lished were bettor maintained than at other
points. Individual strength was shown also
by Colorado and Southern first preferred,
Tennessee Coal, the International Pap
stocks. Northern Pacific, the Hocking Valley
stocks. New York. Chicago and St. Louis first
preft-rred, American Car, American Linseed
Oil and Chicago Terminal. Pullman reacted
sharply after its prolonged advance, receding
an extreme nine points and losing 4Vi net.
Consolidated Gas fell 4 1 , i. but partly recovered.
The local traction stocks and Sugar were sharp |
sufferers in the late weakness. The reaction
was as much without explanation as yester
day's advance and could only be attributed to
the cli Ring up of professional operations. Call
money ruled at 5 per cent tor most of the day,
but stiffened to <" per cent before the close.
The coming hank statement is the subject of
surmise and observers are unable to figure on
any Improvement. The movement of money to
the interior shows some falling off, but still
continues in that direction on balance, and
the course of New York exchange at several !
Important points continues downward. The
i.ub-ireapury has taken more from the banks
and the applications for anticipated interest on
Government bonds have proved entirely insig
nificant. With no gain in cash resources from
any source, the condition of the banks could
only have been strengthened by a further con
traction in loans. The actual rate for de
mand sterling bounded up a full % to-day.
Cotton Mil* continue exceedingly scarce and
the demand for exchange quite large. This de
mand '.s attributed in part to the require
ments for remittance on account of the conver
sion of Central Pacific securities. The possi
bility of gold exports depends upon how
much further this demand shall extend. The
rate for demand sterling Is now only Vio under I
that at which gold went out earlier In the year.
There was a notable broadening in the bond
market, many quiescent issues coming into ac
tivity. The tone Is generally strong. Total
sales, par value, $2, 120,00f1.

Chicago Grain Market.
1 CHICAGO, Oct. 19.â Wheat opened easy and
lower. Disappointing rabies and the steady in
crease of local stocks were the main factors
ii) alnst the market. There was very little ef
! fort made to follow up the decline, and after
I the price had worked off %c the selling dis
appeared entirely. Then for two hour* the mar
ket remained In a comatose state, with fluc
tuations narrow and trades widely separated.
During the last thirty minutes the firmness In
corn and complaints of poor condition of win
ter wheat started an upturn which was but
fr?b!y contested and the market closed (Inn
at the best price of the day. The weakness
of outside markets handicapped the trade. De
cember opened Me to %c lower at 70%@70%c,
touched 70%@71c. declined to 70% c, and ad
vanced to 71. at the close.
Corn ruled firm and active. Buying became
so pronounced that shorts were forced to cover
and a rapid advance followed. T/here was a
slight reaction on profit-taking, but elevator
buying and shipping demand caused an up
turn, and the market closed at the top. Light
receipts and poor buckings returns accelerated
the advance. December rose to 32 He at the
close.
Buying by shorts and strength In corn
steadied oats. The easiness of ocean rates
helped the advance. December closed with
sellers at 22% c.
Provisions slumped quite early when any
Belling pressure was applied to the market.
There was no fresh feature connected with the
trade to account for the weakness. January
pork Closed 10c lower at $9 30?fr> 32%; January
lard, Be lower at {5 32%, and January ribs 7%e
lower at $4 87%.

FOR BURGLARS
Harries' Experience a
Mystery.
Oakland Office Sun Francisco Call,
idway, oot. 19.
: by the Oakland
forces that the
irglary at the Harries home
mil g was not a burglary
I, but an of young Harry
Ham- latlj contradicted by the
The first intimation that the Oakland
detectives did not consider it necessary to
make any further investigation was con
veyed in a message to tho San Francisco
Police Department sent by Detective
Denny Holland on Tuesday evening.
Detective Holland told Chief Lees' repre
sentative that he had looked into every
phase of the alleged sensational burglary
and was convinced thai there were more
circumstances pointing to it as a fake
than indicated that a serious crime had
been committed. *
Tho impression of the burglary con
veyed by the investigations of the de
tectives are substantiated by them with
arguments that they consider conclusive.
One of those who have investigated the
matter thoroughly says:
"In the ;irst place there is nothing lack
ing in what appears to be a first-clas3,
isp-to-date dime novel burglary. The tele
phone wires were cut, the white powder
was around for any stray dogs that might
appear, the windows were open for the
ingress and egress of the burglars
though one of th.Â« windows through
which youn? Harries says a burglar
escared" I will sweur no one has passe 1
through within the past month.
â¢â¢It would seem natural that when the
boy satisfied himself there were burglars
in the house and armed himself he
would certainly call lilts father -tor*
rushing downstairs to meet desperate
characters in th>^ dark single-handed.
The burglars' tools, so called, cannot be
eaid to be burglars' tools at all. A lo:>k
at them would convince anybody or this,
and why should burglars go into the barn
and take a monkey wrench, which they
left on the dining-room floor? Of what
i^o sre the other pieces of metal found
in the house? When we examined the
doors and windows there was nothing to
Indicate that any entrance had been
forced. Most certainly there was noth
ing to indicate that any of the tools
3'ound in the house had been used on any
door or window. We have compared Th.i
boy's EtoryJ as nearly as we can get it,
for no one has yet been permitted to m â 
him, with every shot fired, and we, act
ing on this theory, that it was all a
fake, can account for every shot but one,
v. h:'ch went through the front wind >w
and across the street. If *â¢< could lind
that bullet our presumption would be
established beyond doubt.
"No motive, so far as we know, has
yet been discovered to account for the
strange acting of young Harries, presum
ing that there was no real burglary, but
rumors have reached us that there might
possibly be something discovered In ban
Francisco. I would like anybody who
really believes that the desperate strug
gle took place to follow the trail taken
by young Harries and the burglars
Through tho house, and to look at the
direction in which the shots were fired,
and he would at once see how very im
probable the story appears. Anyhow,
there is so much about it to suggest a
huge farce that we do not believe there
is any use pursuing our investigation any |
further."
.After hearing all th*Â» details of the ai- :
leged robbery, the San Francisco de
tectives leached the same conclusion is !
their brethren on this side of the ay
Members of the Harries family dcclar â¢ !
that th<> conclusion reached by the police !
is without any reasonable foundation
They are absolutely certain that two
d.-sp^rate men were In the house an that
young Harries had a violent encounter
with them both and only escaped death
by a very narrow margin.
The police, however, declare that a dead
burglar or a trail of blood would have
been the best evidence of the genuineness
of tho encounter.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FBIDAY, OCTOBER 20, 1899.
MISS LURING OF
BERKELEY NOT
YET A BRIDE
Proposal Was Made
Too Rashly.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Oct. 19.
Miss Counle Loring of West Berkeley
is not yet a bride, and Del Cutting Bush,
who wanted to be married in a hurry, has
gone back to Sacramento.
The young lady, who is but 17 years old,
cannot understand why the young man
should have procured a marriage license
before he had even made a proposition
of marriage to her. Mr. Bush realizes
that the marriage Is off and has returned
the license to the County Clerk and all
West Berkeley is a-wondering.
The story of this peculiar escapade is
thus told by Miss Loring:
"The whole affair is ridiculous," she
said, "and 1 would give anything to have
it all hushed up. 1 had no Idea that Mr.
Bush li ii any such intention.
"Of course, I used to know him when
we were children together in Sacramento.
He even came to see me once, I remem
ber. But ours was just a mere acquaint
ance. Why. he never even flirted, as the
rest of the boys, do you know.
"When he came to Bee us last Monday
I barely knew him, our acquaintance had
been so long ago.
"Knowing that he had no friends here
mother asked him to stop with us until
the next day, when he said that he would
have to return to Sacramento. We all
treated him kindly because we sympa
thized with him In his loss.
"Monday afternoon a friend and I went
with him to Mountain View Cemetery,
where he had some business to attend to.
We left him there and went down town
to do some shopping.
"The next day he said he must go to
San Francisco, and went away. It must
have been then that he bought the
license, for that evening ho proposed
to me.
"I was so surprised that I hardly knew
what to say. 1 felt sorry for him on ac
count of his mother's death, but the
whole thing was BO ridiculous that I could
not help but laugh.
"I told him it was out of the question
and he must not think of such a thing.
"It was only the next, day while on
the boat going to San Francisco to do
some chopping that a friend spoke to
me of having seen my name announced
as one of the parties to a marriage
license.
"I was fairly stunned, for I had not the
slightest idea that the man had had the
presumption to go and gel a license be
fore he had oven asked me to marry him.
"It is simply awful to be talked about
in this way. And what will my friends
think of me?
"Surely the man's mind is unbalanced.
A\'h>' any Bane man when be was refused
111 about it, 1 think;
don't you?"
Miss Loring's father cannot account for
I>â¢ l Bush's behavior, and says that the
: 1.'.-s of his mother must have at
. his. mind.
Sullivan Held for Trial.
ALAMEDA, Oct. 19.â The preliminary
examination of C. C. Sullivan was con
tinued to-day. The courtroom was crowd
ed, a? on the preceding day. Sullivan's
attorneys made a hard light for their
client, but the evidence was so convincing
as to the prisoner's guilt that Justfcp
Morris bound him over to answer before
the Superior Court nnd lixed his bonds
at $5000. Attorney <!'ss, who prosecuted
the case against Sullivan when he was.
sortenced from Fresno County to fifty
years' imprisonment, was In coiirt a while
this morning and sat beside Deputy Dis
trict Attorney M. l*in. Sullivan had
changed bo in appearance since that time
that Mr. (Joss could not recognize him.

BOWDEN AND HIS EX-CLIENT.

THE PHILHARMONICS
OPEN THEIR SEASON
The San Francisco Philharmonic Or
chestra gave its opening concert of the
second season at Association Hall last
evening. Considering the fact that the
members do not make any great preten
sions as musicians, it must be admitted
that they played very well indeed. There
Is a marked improvement noticeable since
lost season, especially so In the ranks of
the brass and wood instruments, except
ing perhaps the flute, which needs a little
cleaning. '!'!'â¢â  strings are very strong
and proved the main feature. The orches
tra played: Overture, "Rosamunde"
(Schubert;; selections from "Martha";
waltz for strings (Volkmann); Procession,
from "Meisteralnger" (Wagner). James
Hamilton Howe, the conductor, appeared
to have done some good work with the
orchestra. It promises' to prove a good
acquisition t< the coming musical season.
The BQioists were Bernhard Mollen
hauer and Mrs. Mary Weave? McCauley.
Mr. Mollenbauer is a violinist of superior
ability. His bowing is graceful and firm,
bis tone is mellow and broad and his ex
ecution Imbued with that care and shad
ing which reveal the thorough artist. He
played Wienlawski's Concerto in D
minor, "Serenade," by Schubert; "Ber
ceuse, by Baurei, and "Elfentanz," by
Popper. The beauty of Mrs. MeCauley'a
true lyric soprano la its firmness, and the
lady shows her vocal Intelligence by a
clear diction and. an interpretation re
markably sympathetic. It is the great
care of execution which stamps Mrs. Mc-
Cauley a vocalist of great ability. She
sang the aria "Jerusalem," from the ora
torio "St. Paul/ to which the orchestra
played a very shaky accompaniment, and
some songs by Hawley, Harris, Chisholrn
and l>r. Arne. She was heartily ap
plauded. ALFRED METZGER
Raahe's Family in Trouble.
Fred Raabe, the Democratic politician,
has locked horns with the men of Cap
tain .Tamos W. Gillen's division of the
Mission police force. Raabe's son Fred,
who insists in coming in contact with the
Mission police, was arrested at an early
hour yesterday morning: for disturbing the
peace by Officer C. Barnes. This intru
sion into the homestead of Raabe caused
the head of the house to take it on him
self to assert his authority over that of
the Mission force. This he did by doire'nir
the footsteps of Officer Barnes while on
duty on Hlxtecinth street last night
Kaabe and his son-in-law, "lies" Sim
mons, made it a point to station them
selves in doorways along the street, and
as Barnes passed they saluted him in
language anything but choice.
Not desiring to encounter any trouble
from Raabe and his assistant. Barnes no
tified the station of the manner in which
he was being annoyed. Captain Gillen
detailed officer C. Taylor in citizens'
clothes to investigate, and, if Raabe was
guilty, to arrest nim. This.was done, with
the result that father and son-in-law
landed in the police stationâ Raabe for
drunkenness and Simmons for disturbing
the peace.
The incarcerated politician gave notice
that there will be several vacancies on the
police force in the course of a short time.

REPUTING THE
BURNED FORESTS
Work to Be Begun at
Once Near Pasadena.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PASADENA. Oct. 19.â Work of replant
ing the burned forests of this section will ;
be begun in a few weeks as an experi
ment. Acting Chief Forester J. W. Tou- :
mey of Washington was here on Sunday, ,
and in company with City Engineer Clapp,
ex-Mayor T. P. Lukens and United States
Hydrographer J. B. Lippincott, made an
inspection trip by carriage along the foot '
of the mountains from Arroyo Seco Can
yon to Santa Anita Canyon. As a result
of what Mr. Tourney saw of the burned
districts he has promised that he will use '
his influence with the Government for an ]
appropriation of several hundred dollars
to plant seeds in the burned areas this <
spring.
Ex-Mayor T. P. Lukena and W. G.
Kerkhoff are going to do some planting
on their own account, however, whether
the Government acts or not. But It is
probable that Mr. .Lukens will be appoint
ed superintendent of the tree planting
I which will be done by the Government.
The watersheds have been denuded, and
it is known that unless the trees can be
made to grow in the mountains north of
this city the city's water supply will go.
Water has been very scarce all summer,
iso scarce Indeed that street sprinkling
, had to be stopped for a time in half the
I city, and some of the higher situated resi
dents could not get water in their bath
tubs.
Mr. Lukons, formerly president of the
Pasadena National Bank, has devoted all
I his time of late to studying forestry, just
out of pure love of it. 'When he is in the
mountains he carries with him a sharp
stick, with which he thrusts into the
ground seeds of pine trees that he hap
pens to see. The seeds will not grow usu
ally unless, helped along by artificial
means. Mr. Lukens thinks that if every
body would do just that much many trees
would spring up where now seeds decay.
He has spent the entire Bummer in Bear
Valley, where he built himself a little
house far up in the mountains, surround
ed with all facilities for studying and de
veloping seeds of all sorts. One hundred
pounds of seeds that Mr. Lukens has pre
pared will arrive shortly and will be
planted in the mountains. Forest Rangers
Lew Newcomb and John Hartwell went to
the mountains to-day to carry out this
scheme of Mr. Lukens and Kerkhoff.
They will establish a camp on the ridge
between â¢ Eatons Canyon and the Little
1 Santa Anita.. They will cut fire tracks
along all ridges to the main ridge. Th< <-
tracks are paths through tho brush about
six feet wide, cleared entirely of brush
and leaves, so that fire cannot cross. They
also furnish avenues of access to fires.
-wcomb will plant along these fire
tracks seed of the pinus tubereulata, or
hickory pine, which Mr. Lukens has been
propagating.
The hickory pine is a native of San Ber
nardino County and grows there very pro
fusely. The seeds are found scattered
about the ground. Heat opens them, and
the process is very difficult, because a lit
tle too much heat will kill the seed. The
tree is practically fireproof. When a lire
strikes it is burns a little way, if it has a
good start, and then dies. Sometimes the
tree reaches a height of 100 feet, but not
often. It grows very rapidly. Mr. Lukens
has found by experimenting that in five
years the tree grows so rapidly that if the
seed were planted along the mountains
! three feet apart they would cover the area
almost impenetrably. The seed must have
care, however. It should be planted at the
side of a stone or stick so that the sun's
rays will not wilt the young plant. Seeds
planted last July, three months ago, by
Mr. Lukens have attained a height of
three inches already.
When Newcomb and Hartwell have
planted the ridge between Eaton Canyon
and Little Santa Anita they will plant
between Big Santa Anita and Little Santa
Anita.
The forestry people agree with Mr. Lu
kens thai the first area to be planted is
that which has been burned, partly as a
protection to the native forests now
standing, for the flro will stop when it
strikes pinus tuberculata, Then, too, the
canyons ought to be planted, because it is
in the canyon that the fire usually starts.
If these places were planted the forests
would be very valuable, not alone as pre
servers of moisture, etc.. but the wood is
very hard and available for use in making
ax-handles and the like.
This section is stirred up over the pres
ervation of the forests, so many fires nave
occurred during the past year or two. Mr.
Tourney is impressed by a look at the yel- .
low-brown mountain sides where once tall
trees grew. There is greatJtrouble in get
ting the (I '\vnnent to make appropria
tions. An appropriation has been secured,
however, for the good work of building
trails through the mountains and getting
out the dead timber. All rangers have
been Instructed by Mr. Tourney to make a !
careful inspection through the forests and \
estimating the amount of dead logs that
exist. This estimate will be submitted to i
the Government and the logs will be sold I
to whomever desires to haul them away.
i The Idea is that when fires occur they get ,
1 into the logs and burn for days and weens, j
spreading the sparks to new territory af- ;
i ter the tiro was supposed to have been all
I put out by the fighters. Sometimes logs
1 roll long distances out of burned districts
' into unburned districts and start new dis
| astrous fires. Especially is this true when
! the logs roll into short brush which read
i ily ignites. ;
LABOR FEDERATION WILL
ASSIST THE JEWELERS
Will Take Action for the Purpose of
Obtaining a Reduction in
Working Hours.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 39.â The execu
tive council of the American Federation
of Labor at its session to-day voted that
the federation financially assist the jew
elers of New York, Newark and Provi
dence, with a view of the more thorough
organization of the trade and to be help
ful in every way to secure a recognition
of the union, as well as a reduction in the
hours of their daily labor.
In consequence of the fact that a large
number of employers are alleged to be
unnecessarily forcing their employes to
work long hours per day under the pre
tense of overtime, the executive council
passed resolutions condemning the prac
tice.
The crganization of the workprs of tne
far West was again taken up, and the of
ficers located at headquarters were in
structed to keej> in close correspondence
with the organizers and to suomit the
jiarnps of additional organizers to the ex
ecutive council for approval.
Tho council adjourned this afternoon, to
meet next at T>> troit, Mich., at a date to
be fixed hereafter.

DESERTER COMES
BACK TO STAND
HIS PUNISHMENT
Remorse Leads Sallee
to Prison.
â¢ â
THE MOUNT GRETNA RANGE
â¢
HOW IT WAS CUT TO PIECES BY
KRAG-JORGENSONS.
â¢
An Old Sergeant Who Seeks Further
Service in the Army After
Twenty-Eight Years in
Harness.
It has been decided after all that Cap
tain Leitch, who was appointed an aid
to General Shafter, must join the com
mand to which he was recently promoted.
Captain Leitch within two weeks was
promoted to the command of Company G
of the Twenty-fifth infantry, stationed at
Fort Sam Houston, San Antonio, Tex.
His promotion removed him to another'
army department, and so, before he could
be made an aid to General Shafter, the
consent of the adjutant general had to
be obtained. As Company G of the
Twenty-fifth is without ,any officer, and
as there is not an officer to spare in the
Department of Texas, the adjutant gen
eral declined to ratify Shatter's appoint
ment of Leitch, and so he must join his
command. Fort Sam Houston is the most
desirable post in the South, however, and
Captain Leitch will be its post com
mander. His friends here, however, will
be sincerely sorry to see him leave.
Stricken with remorse, Howard Sallee
of Company D of the Eighth infantry ap
peared at headquarters at the Presidio
yesterday, announced that he was a de
serter and gave himself into custody. He
enlisted two and a half years before the
war and served through the Santiago
campaign. When his regiment returned
and while it was camped in Alabama he
deserted, and for a year had tried to
evade arrest. He found it did not pay,
however, and so yesterday he hunted up
the authorities and gave himself up. His
case will be attended to by a court-mar
tial, and his punishment will depend upon
his military record, his conduct and the
cause of his desertion.
The board of officers appointed to in
quire into certain damage done to the j
shooting range at Mount Gretna, Penn
sylvania, has about finished its work.
The range is the property of the State of
Pennsylvania, and was rented by the
Twenty-eighth infantry while it was at
Camp Meade awaiting orders to proceed
out here and to the Philippines.
it was found when the regiment left
that the movable shades over the targets
(used to protect the targets during in
clement weather and when not In use)
had been all torn to pieces, and, what was
| worse, it seemed as if the damage was
done by some agency other than bullets.
The State demanded damages and de
clared that the range had been damaged
by the wanton acts of the soldiers. In
that case the damages would have to
come out of the pockest of the men, so the
board was ordered to investigate among
j the men and officers of the regiment,
' which is now stationed at the Presidio.
The result Is another demonstration of
the efficiency of the Krag-Jorgenson rifle.
There were several hundrt 1 thousand
i shots fired, and naturally some of them
went wild and struck the shades and
framework or' the targets. With the
Springfield rirte, with which the State of
Pennsylvania is familiar, this did no more
than cut splinters; and with the ICrae;-
Jorgenson it was the same until the bui
lt/ 1 struck some more solid obstruct inn.
Then there was trouble. It was found
that whenever the new bullet struck a
nail or a hinge or a bolt, instead of flat
tening out and stopping, it just took hinge
or bolt or nail right along with it, and
much of the wood in the beams followed.
Ar a consequence the targets were
j wrecked. There had been no calculation
of the force of the new bullet, and so the
managers of the range at once came to
the conclusion that such damage could
only be done by something more destruc
tive even than the bullets fired. The re
port of the board will go East at once and
will exonerate the men of the regiment
from blame for the damage.
Sergeant Henry Blum of Battery A,
Third Artillery, has re-enlisted in the
army for the seventh time. He is now
twenty-eight years in service. Sergeant
Blum served one enlistment of five years
in the Eighth Infantry, one of five years
in the Fourth Artillery, one of five years
In the First Artillery, two of five years
each in the Fifth Artillery and one of
three years in the Third Artillery. He is
now going back to Battery A of the Third
Artillery for three years more. He has
served all over the T'nited States from
I South Carolina to Alaska, and has been in
the Nes Perco, Sioux and Bannock Indian
wars. He is hale and hearty and a good
soldier yet, and he has a long way to go
before he will reach the half century
mark.
"William D. Kelly, clerk in the adjutant
general's department, will be one of the

DRUNKEN TROOPS
CAUSE DELAY
Soldiers of the Forty-
Sixth Imprisoned.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CINCINNATI. Oct. 19.â The Forty-Â«ixth
Regiment of Volunteers, en route from
Massachusetts to Manila, was delayed
here by enforced drumhead court-martial
on account of an epidemic of drunkenness.
On the first section, which arrived yester
day, the men were holding high carnival.
Colonel Heeler immediately called a
drumhead court-martial, which sent thir
ty of the offenders to the Columbus Bar
racks. The other sections were all side
tracked at Valley Junction for more trials,
and additional Installments were to-day
sentenced to the Columbus Barracks
guardhouse awaiting further action. The
trains to-day were still held at Valley
Junction.
The Big Four railway people received
advices from Valley Junction at 4 p. m.
that they had at last been able to get all
the sections of the train bearing the For
ly-sixth Regiment under way for St.
Louis. Several detachments of the troops
were sent back guarding prisoners en
route to Columbus Barracks. It is impos
sible to ascertain how many have been
sentenced to the prison at Columbus. The
troops guarding these prisoners will pro
ceed directly from Columbus to San Fran
cisco to join their regiment. As all of
those who were causing trouble on the
train, and especially at places where stops
were made, were sentenced at the drum
head court-martial to the prison at Co
lumbus, it is thought that there will be
no further trouble along the way.
STRIKE ON GREAT
NORTHERN THREATENED
Conductors, Engineers, Firemen,
Brakemen and Switchmen Hope
to Tie Up the Road.
ST. PAUL, Oct. 19.â A general strike on
the Great Northern will probably occur
within a few days. It will Include con
ductors, engineers, firemen, brakemen and
switchmen, and the men expect to tie up
the road from end to end. In the great
strike of five years ago the conductors
held aloof, but they hav;e been brought
into the present trouble by a recent order
requiring them to pay for bonds covering
damages to trains under their charge.
The list of grievances given by the men
is a long one. and they claim to have been
unable to secure anything like satisfac
tion from the management. Since last
March grievance committees have been
almost constantly in this city trying to
reach some agreement with the railway
officials, but without result.

U auspicious morning, apparently,
i have dawned for the jubilee

threatened from the overhanging clouds,
and a raw wind blew drizzle through
the streets of the city. A distinct feeling
of g-umminess was ,in the air made dis
cordant with the sullen flapping:* of the
overhead decorations and the whistle of

appeared as if the puckering string- up

devoted heads below a flood of water to

should operate to destroy the elaborate

I diamond Jubilee. The parade was sched
to start from Odd Fellows' building,
Market and Seventh streets, at 11 o'clock,
; and, at 10 o'clock, although the streets
I in that vicinity were alive with members
|of the order, the prediction was fully
ventured by many that this feature would
have to be abandoned. Thr.se in charge,
however, had no such misgiving. They
had .started In early to move that pro-
I cession and, rain or shine, they purposed
to do It, and they were kept busy getting
the different divisions Into formation.
The people of San Francisco, whose In
i ordinate appetite for street pageants has
: passed Into a proverb, were as unmindful
of the weather as the chiefs of the
| parade. They were out early and lined
I the sidewalks along the entire line of
march. Market and Kearny streets, es
pecially, were packed with humanity
waiting impatiently In the drizzle for the
passing of the parade.
Eleven o'clock came and with it the
signal to move. As the platoon of
mounted police In front moved out and
the drum major in a gorgeous bearskin
twirled his baton for the opening march,
The Call's cannon boomed out from the
tower of the Claus Spreckels building,
notifying the waiting thousands down
town that the procession was headed
their way.
And It really was a parade of which
| any organization might be proud. It was
j full of color and life and music. It was
vibrant with variety and there seemed to
be in it men and women and flags and
fluttering banners without end. Not in a
number of years has any single order
turned" out in San Francisco any such
number of representatives, and, apparent
ly, in no order in the State is there more
opportunity for brilliant street display.
Ten divisions made up the parade, and
each offered something different from the
preceding one. Following the platoon of
police and the band of the San Francisco
Lodge of Odd Fellows rode Grand Marshal
M. M. Estee and his thirty red-sashed
aids. Following came the khaki-uniformed
band of the First Regiment, California
volunteers, and after them passed divis
ion after division of all that Is beautiful
In Odd Fellowship allowable to the un
lnitlate eye.
Plaudits for this feature and that were
plentiful all along the route, but no show
ing in the big procession made such
a pleasurable Impression as the ladles of
the Rebekah drill corps. As they marched
along in the grand marshal's escort, look
ing good enough to eat in their natty uni
forms, the crowds on the sidewalks
cheered and handclapped their approval.
Handkerchiefs and hats and flags were
waved at them, and on the counter-march
they were applauded again and again by
their brothers in Odd Fellowship march
ing the other way.
The ladies of the drill corps were not
many, but they were pretty nearly the
whole thing. Three corps marched on
foot, and representatives from all the Re
bekah lodges, in cream-colored riding
habits, rode as aids to the marshals of di
visions. The marching ladies represented
Stockton, this city and San Jose, the
Stockton girls leading the way, in the nat
tiest kind of uniforms of dark blue, with
hussar Jackets barred with white. They
were under, the command of Captain Em
ma Lambert, and aside from their general
appearance In the line, individually they
were flattering types of feminine loveli
ness, for which California is famous. Cer
tainly In this regard at least Stockton has
made commendable progress in the State's
fifty years of Odd Fellowship.
The San Francisco Rebekah Drill Corps
was no whit behind the feminine array
from up the San Joaquin in appearance.
Miss Allie Parker was in command. The
uniform of black, corded with white, was
something worth going miles to see, sit
ting so perfectly on such prettily moving
figures.
It would take a book, and a big one at
that, to enumerate all the features of the
big parade. It took more tba 0 an hour,

THE SAN FRANCISCO CAI/L, FRIDAY, OCTOBER 20, 1899.
to pass a given point and there was no
foot of the way that something original
in formation, color and decoration did not
burst on the eye of the delighted spec
tators. Plumes of purple and red and
white tossed in the whistling breeze,
graceful ferns were arched over carriages
and other conveyances, float* were many
and artistic, banners were as many as
marching men and the stars and stripes
fluttered from every hand and streamed
from every buttonhole.
Every lodge in the city and from all the
surrounding country was represented.
There were Odd Fellows and Rebekahs
from Marln and San Jose, and Rebekahs
-and Odd Fellows from Sacramento,
Berkeley, Oakland, Alameda, Nlles, Liv
ermore, Woodbridge, Woodland, San Le
andro. There were whole cantonments of
Patriarchs Militant and large bodies of
the orphansâ boy and girl â of Odd Fel
lows. How many thousand there were in
line is a mere guess, but 5000 would be a
conservative estimate.
And the floatsâ well, no prettier ones
have been seen in any parade on the
streets of San Francisco. There were two
Rebekahs at the Well, and it would be a
hard-hearted man that could choose off
hand between either. One of them ln-
Qtly fed water from a jug to a Jacob
who rather appeared to like the job. Do
you blame him? There was a very
artistic float representing the compact
between Jonathan and David and another
of Oriental Lodge that was a dream of
pretty girls.
The line of march was from Odd Fel
lows' Hall down Market street to Mont
gomery, to Bush, to Kearney, to Market,
to Van Ness avenue, to Ellis street, coun
termarching on Van Ness avenue to Mar
ket street, to Seventh to pass in review.
And when the distance had been trav
ersed beneath the still threatening skies
the universal verdict was that the parade
had never been excelled, taking all feat
ures into consideration, in San Francisco.
( 'an you blame California Odd Fellow
ship if it should pat itself on the back
after such an achievement?
PATRIARCHS AND
RESEKAHS DRILL,
"Weather conditions that did not deter
the Odd Fellows In the morning from
giving one of the finest parades ever seen
In this city could not keep the crowds
away last night from Mechanics' Pa
vilion, where the great central -floor
space had been cleared for the competi
tive and exhibition drill of the Patri
archs Militant and Rebekahs.
Notwithstanding that the disagreeable
drizzle augured poorly for a big audience,
there seemed to be a general feeling in
the air that only those that went early
would find seats. This feeling was the
correct one. L.arkin street, in front of
the big pavilion, was jammed with
humanity at 7 o'clock, and half an hour
later, the doors having been opened
meanwhile, not a seat in the vast In
terior â and seats had been provided
around the four sides of the drill floor
and in the galleries for 6000 peopleâ was
to be had. Still the crowds kept pouring i
in until there was a perfect jam in the
broad rear aisles, where, people being un
able to see the drill square, moved about
vainly in efforts to get a view. Scores of
policemen were kept busy keeping the
vast audience from crowding over into
the space reserved for the drill teams.
The lighting and decoration of the vast |
interior were superb and, when the drill '
teams of the Patriarchs Militant and i
Rfbekahs were marched out onto the
floor shortly after 8 o'clock for inspec
tion, the scene was so magnificent that
the great audience involuntarily burst
into prolongr -d applause. To the band of
the Sacramento Patriarchs Militant and
its soldierly looking drum major ti^is
given the honor of furnishing the music
for the evening.
After inspection and review and the
dismissal, the drill team of Canton Sac
ramento No. 1, eighteen men, Captain W.
E. Bowman commanding. Lieutenant J.
C. Ing Jr., and Ensign George Bock,
marched onto the floor to go through the j
evolutions of the competitive sword and '
field drill. Major Charles Jansen, C. N. :
G., inspector of the second brigade, Major ;
T. J. Cunningham, First California !
Volunteers, and Captain T. W. Sparrowe,
Company G, First California Volunteers,
acted as Judges.
From the first word of command and
for a full half hour afterward the men
I of Sacramento Canton moved like clock
i workâ at least, It seemed that way to the
; spectators, who hardly iinished applaud
ing one difficult evolution before they felt
called upon to acclaim the next. The drill
; a^ points was simply marvelous, and
there were many freely ventured opinions
that the team of Rldgeley Canton No. 15
, of Stockton, the only other competitor for
i a prize, would find it difficult to beat the
I performance.
Before the applause for the Sacramen
tans had died out the Stocktonlans were
marched on, presenting a fine appearance.
Captain W. Bruce was in command, with
lieutenant George Hudson and Ensign
Ben Woodhull. Confidently the team, went
at its work, receiving for the next half
hour a meed of applause that was not
stinted. And when they had concluded
and presented themselves for inspection
It was utterly imposible for the non-mili
tary audience to pick the winner. The
judges handed in their decision late in
the evening. It will be made public to
day.
Aft^r the competition the drill corps of
San Francisco Canton No. 5, Captain C.
]{. Kohrnbeck commanding. Lieutenant
Eugene Brackett and Ensign H. W. No
well, marched onto the floor and gave a
loudly applauded exhibition drill.
And then the Rebekahs. The big audi
ence had been waiting for them all the
evening. The drill corps of Stockton, San
Jose and San Francisco were on the pro
gramme for prize exhibitions, and when
the nine blue and gold clad members of
San Jose Corps marched on at 10:30
o'clock, headed by Captain Florence
Lewis and Lieutenant Florence Barthell,
the applause was deafening. The corps
was a small one, but it made up for lack
of numbers in grace of movement, and
undoubtedly won a warm place in the
hearts of the audience.
The stunning-looking Stockton corps of
Rebekahs, this time minus the diminutive
full dr^ss mascot, were received with a
salvo (if cheers. And they deserved it.
Tt would be hard to Ilnd a more -jaunty
looking set of young womanhood. Even
their sisters from this city, who followed
them in the drill, had to look carefully to
thfir laurels. They did the drill splen
didly, both of them, and added that zest
that only lovely femininity can to an
evening's entertainment.
The Stockton Rebekahs were officered
as follows: Captnln, Emma Lambert;
lieutenant, Clara Breitenbacher, and en
sign. Eva Harvey, San Francisco's of
ficers are: Captain, Allie Parker; lieuten
ant, Ella Campbell; ensign, Winnie Dowle.
RAINY DAY CROWD
AT THE PAVILION
After the parade crowds found their
way to the Mechanics' Pavilion, where
they were made to feel at home by the
several committees at the booths. . These
were crowded during the afternoon, and
in the evening they were overcrowded by
those who were unable to get an oppor
tunity to witness the competitive drills.
District No. 55, the booth of which is In
charge of ladies of Mission Rebekah
Lodge, has been arranged in a most
artistic manner with all the furnishing of
a modern parlor, and is one of the most
attractive booths on the promenade. The
ladies who â  were In charge yesterday
were: Mrs. Timbrell, Mrs. Nesbit, Mrs.
L. B. Holcomb, Mrs. Burkhardt, Mrs.
Ash worth and Mrs. W. W. Barnes.
To-night there will be the awarding of
prizes won last night, and the grand ball
until 1 o'clock in the morningâ the final of
the golden jubilee.
The information bureau, In charge of
Mrs. J. Z. Gibbs of Amity Rebekah Lodge,
was visited by an immense number of
people, who were in quest of information,
which was most cheerfully furnished. The
lady also had charge of the books, in
which many Odd Fellows registered. Up
to 8 o'clock last night more than 1000 had
inscribed their names on the books.
â¢â â 
CONCERT IN LIEU

VALUABLE HAUL MADE
IN A LODGING HOUSE
Burglar Breaks Into a Room and
Steals Three Hundred and
Fifty Dollars.
The police are investigating the mysteri
ous burglary which was committed
Wednesday morning in a lodging-house at
14 Turk street. Shortly after 8 o'clock
Mr?. -Anderson, the proprietress, after se
curely locking her apartments, left the
house to do some shopping. On her re
turn about an hour later she was astound
ed to find that some one had entered her
apartments during her absence and got
away with three hundred and fifty dol
lars in gold. The money was in a secret
dra.wer in an old-fashioned rocking-chair.
The thief forced open the door of the
apartments with a "jimmy," which was
found in the hallway. Mrs. Anderson at
once reported her loss to Chief Lees, who
detailed Policemen Coleman and Magee
on the case. After investigation they be
came convinced that the thief kijew where
the money was hidden and waited his op
portunity to steal it.
hast night Mrs. Anderson visitod police
headquarters and personally pleaded with
the head of the department to recover the
money, which was all she had in the
world. She strongly suspects one of her
lodgers, but for lack of evidence against
him the police hesitated taking him into
custody.
Big Crowd at the Chutes.
The weather was bad, but the crowd
was good at the Chutes last night. The
management invited all the guests to
free refreshments at the candy stand,
a policy that will be continued here
after on rainy nights.
The "Sine Cura's Fifth Hon."
The most enjoyable and successful of
the series of hops given by the Sine Cura
Club was held last evening at Hlnman's
Hall, corner of Twenty-first and Howard
streets. George P. Welsh and Miss Mary
U. ICenetlck officiated, respectively, as
floor manager and assistant. After a
striking grand march at 9 o'clock contain
ing many intricate figures the regular
programme was in order, dancing continu

WATER COMPANIES MAY
NOT SHUT OFF SUPPLY
MUST SELL TO ALL PATRONS
WHO PAY.
Decision by Judge Hawley of Interest
to Farmers, Miners and House
holders Throughout the
Country.
United States District Judge Hawley of
Nevada handed down an opinion yester
day in the United States Circuit Court of
Appeals affirming the right of an indi
vidual, upon his paying the rates, to be
supplied perpetually with water by a
corporation engaged in the business of
selling water. The opinion is of great im
portance, not only to every householder,
but to every farmer, miner and stock
raiser in the country.
The original suit was filed by James M.
Sharp, a citizen of San Diego County,
against the San Diego Land and Town
Company, a corporation organized and
existing under the laws of the State of
Kansas. The corporation had become in
volved in litigation with a bondholder,
and pending the proceedings had cut off
Sharp's water supply upon the plea that
his land was upon higher ground than
that of the remainder of the patrons of
the corporation, and that he should pay
a higher rate than others. Sharp claimed
that under a contract between himself
and the corporation, he was entitled to
perpetual use of the water upon his pay
ing the legal rate. It was urged on the
other hand that the contract was invalid
and void, and that even if valid, it could
be terminated by either party at any time.
The United States Court for the Southern
District of California gave a decision in
favor of Sharp, whereupon the Land and
Town Company appealed. After quoting
numerous authorities to show the weight
and effect of contracts of the character.
Judge Hawley said:
It is enough to say that the Supreme Court
of California, in construing the same, has
uniformly held that the various provisions
with reference to water and water rights
for distribution and sale must be read to
gether and given a practical common-sense
construction and be construed with refer
ence to the prior state of the law and the
mischiefs intended to be remedied by the
change in the organic law in relation
> thereto; that the use of all water appro
priated for sale, rental or distribution is
by the constitution expressly declared to â be :
a' public. use and subject to the regulation â¢
and control of the State, subject to certain
provisions *in , resDect to the rates or com
pensation to ... be collected (which â¢ has no
application to water -furnished by munici
palities); that the constitution expressly de
clares that such rates or compensation shah
be fixed in a - certain , snecined manner at
a certain time and by a certain, body; thai
the right to collect â  the rates or compen
sation so established Is declared to be a
franchise and cannot be exercised â¢ except
by authority and in the manner prescribed
by the statute. appellee *to the continued
'The right of the appellee to the continued
use of the water does not, therefore, de- -
pend upon any of the covenants expressed
in the written contract, and it is wholly
immaterial whether that contract was void
or valid â¢ Â» â¢ The contract has ex
pired and all Us covenants expired with it.
It is manifest that the appellee had acquired
a public use of imp water necessary to irri
gate his lands and he was and is entitled
to avail himself of the privileges and rights
guaranteed him by the constitution, laws
and decisions of the courts of the State of
California.
The company was not Justified in shutting
off the watpr or in demanding from the
appellee a renewal of the former contract
as a condition precedent to his right to the
continued use of the water upon paying the
legal rate fixed for supplying it. The fact
that the lands of the appellee are upon a
higher level than other lands supplied by
the company cannot be urged as a reason
for not supplying water to him unless he
pays a higher rate than, others taking water
from the same stream.
The judgment of the lower court is
affirmed with costs.
Like a beehive-â although we are very
busy we can attend to you: but do not
delay, please, as all genuine grades of
underwear are liable to advance in price.
To-day we can supply you at old rates,
or a little less, but cannot speak for the
future. Buy at once and secure yourself
against any advance in the price.
