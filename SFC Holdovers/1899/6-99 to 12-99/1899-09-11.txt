DREYFUS IS CONFIDENT OF
SOON GAINING HIS LIBERTY.
Views Vary as to the
Length of Time the
Reconvicted Officer Is
to Serve.
From All Sections of the Civil
ized Come Reports of
Protest Against the Injustice
of the Verdict.
RFNNES, Sept. 10.â Dreyfus has
borne the terrible shock with
marvelous fortitude, one might
almost say with unnatural
calm. Yesterday he seemed
stupefied when M. Labori communicat
ed to him the verdict, but has since ral
lied. He passed a quiet night and rose
when his orderly brought him water at
5 o'clock, this morning just as he did
g the trial when it was necessary.
Mme. Dreyfus and Ma.thieu Drey
fus, his brother, visited him during the
- of the afternoon. His brother
;uently left for Paris. The appli-
D to the Court of Revision was
taken to him at noon by M. Labori's as
t and he signed it.
To-day Dreyfus has spoken but llt
: hough he has seemed in better
spirits than might have been antici-
The meeting with his wife was
naturally very affecting, but both held
up as well as possible. He said to her:
"I am not uneasy regarding ray
- :f. as I shall soon be free, but I think
: and my poor children: they will
be branded as the children of a traitor."
He is convinced that the ten years'
â¢~ onment to which he is sentenced

- '"lusion he has undergone on
I Islai.d and he expects to be re
i by October 15, which will be five

' just now see his w^ak state of health
and abnormal impassivity, an ugly sign,
and fear for him more than they care to
express."
The town to-day has been perfectly
calm. There has not been a sign nor a
demonstration nor a cry for or against
Dreyfus. A number of people gathered
to s-^e Mme. Dreyfus visit the prison,
but they were quite respectful.
The troops and masses of gendarmes
who yesterday gave the center of Ren
nes the appearance of a military camp,
have completely vanished. There are
hardly any gendarmes in sight except
near the Dreyfus residence, where a
few are posted. Cavalry officers were
: seen frequenting the cafes this after
i noon, showing that the authorities no
longer fear any trouble here and are
allowing the officers to leave their bar
. racks.
So far as can be ascertained military
men are perfectly satisfied with the
verdict, which they interpret as safe
' guarding the honor of the army and at
! the same time doing an act of mercy to
: Dreyfus, who, they say. sufficiently ex
piated his crime in the awful existence
he passed on Devils Island. They point
out that even if he is sent to Fort Lorte.
it will be to receive henceforth the hu
mane treatment he ha? .-xwrienced
since his return to France.
One Ftrange fact is the extraordi
i nary defense of the opinion respecting
the exact effect of the judgment â
whether he can be degraded again
and whether the five years' solitary
confinement he has undergone will be
regarded as equivalent to the t*Â»n
years' detention to which he is now
sentenced, and whether he will be re
leased next month. This matter is
quite a^ide from the general impres
sion thai he will be pswloncd in .t
few days by President Loubet. who
will find some ground on which to ex
ercise clemency.
M. Demange thinks the five years
will count for nothing, and that Drey
fus, according to the law, will have to
suffer ten years' detention. Many
others, however, including several law
yers, hold a contrary opinion, and de
clare that he will be released in Oc
tober. This, as already cabled, is the
belief of Dreyfus himself.
The correspondent this* afternoon in
terrogated M. Coupers, the clerk of
! the court-martial, on this point. He
was most emphatic in declaring that
Dreyfus must serve ten years from the
i date of a fresh degradation, the court
-1 martial having considered the ca.se as
beginning when Dreyfus appeared be
fore them, disregarding altogether his
i previous sentence.
ML Coupers said: "I have no doubt
j whatever that according to the mili
tary code Dreyfus must undergo deg
radation again, as he was reinstated
as a captain in the army and he ap-
SAN FRANCISCO, MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 11, 1899.
CAPTAIN DREYFUS' NEW PRISON.
The town and citadel of Corts, Island of Corsica, where it is reported the ex-prisoner of Devil's Island
will spend his newly allotted term of imprisonment.
The town of Corte is situated high up In the mountains, just north of the central part of the island
of Corsica, on the high road from Bastia, on the northeast coast, to Ajaccio, on the southwestern, and thirty
miles from either place. It stands on the banks of the river Tavignano, and near the foot of Mount
Rotondo, shown in the background of the picture, from whose summit, 5609 feet high, can be seen the shores of France
and Italy, from Toulon to Leghorn, as well as nearly all o:' Sardinia, to the south. Corte has a population of 5000
souls, and is the seat of the University of Paoli. It has one of the few daily newspapers on the island, and a statue of
Corsica's famous son, Pasquel Paoli, which stands on the o-ntral plaza of the same name. The citadel, with the at
tached fortifications of later date, which may be Dreyfus' new prison home, is shown on the rising ground in tha
back of the picture, a little to the right of the center.
peared before the court in uniform.
: That he will actually be put through
this cruel ordeal I think doubtful. If
it depended on me I know what I
should do. and the President of the re-
I public may think with me."
Colonel Jouaust also declared that
! Dreyfus must serve ten years, but
1 speaking with friends to-day, he ex
; pressed a conviction that there would
i not be a fresh degradation. This cer
emony requires breaking the prisoner's
sword and tearing off his epaulets.
But Dreyfus never had his sword re
stored to him, and he only wore un
dress uniform without epaulets, so
that it would be impossible to carry
out the regulations for degradation.
This is Â»'olonel Jouaust's viÂ«w.
Those who think Dreyfus will be
i released in October because the five
i years on Devils Island will wipe out
i the present sentence saw in the fart
that he was sentenced for exactly ten
i years a confirmation of their view, but
they are mistaken. He was sentenced
to ten years not because that happened
I to double his confinement on Devils
I Island, but because according to mili
] tary code the recording of two votes in
his favor fixes the term of detention at
j ten years. Had the verdict been unan
imous he must have been sentenced to
twenty years.
Those professing to have ascertained
i since the verdict the opinion of the
j judges, declare that the vote of five to
j two was not given by mutual agree
ment, but because the two judges vot
ed in his favor from a conviction of
his innocence.
The present procedure is the appli
j cation for revision, signed by Dreyfus
to-day. It will be sent to Paris. The
! clerk of the court-martial must send a
! complete dossier of the trial, includ
! ing all the documents submitted. A |
\ reporter will be appointed to examine j
:it minutely and ascertain whether
i there be any flaw in the proceedings. >
The result will be submitted to the j
Court of Revision, which will main- j
tain or annull the sentence.
An interesting fact developed to-day |
j is that the police had taken every pre- j
i caution to get Dreyfus safely out of ;
: Rennes in the event of acquittal, in
' which case it was unanimously agreed !
there would have been serious disor- â 
der and probably an attempt upon his ,
i iife. The police had arranged to con- !
â  duct him back to the military prison, j
i after the verdict, with the same pre- i
j cautions as during the trial. He was j
I to have been given civilian attire and j
j a false beard and then to have left the ,
' prison by the small door of th-- re- !
cruiting office leading to the Avenue !
(de la Gare. No one would have ex
: pected him to leave through that
building, which is attached to the mil
itary prison, and, thanks to the dis
guise, the police hoped he would reach
the station safely, where a special train
was waiting to rush him off before the
crowd could have heard of his leav
, ing.
PRESS OF THE WORLD
RINGS WITH EXECRATIONS
LONDON, Sept. 10.â With the excep
i tion of the Jesuit organ in Rome and
the anti-Semite papers, the press of
the whole world is ringing with exe
crations. Even the Russian press joins
in the chorus, although perhaps the
Jews are nowhere more hated than in
Russia. The judges are everywhere
described as criminals, and gloomy
j speculations are indulged in as to
what future is in store for France.
The German press is especially ln-
I dlgnant, the National Zeitung remark
i ing that "even the worst enemy of
j France could not have wjshed what
has happened."
Papers of all nationalities fall in
with the idea of boycotting the exhi
bition.
The Daily Chronicle. says that Mer
cier issues from the case one of the
' blackest scoundrels In history.
The Daily News remarks: "It is no
; longer Dreyfus, but France herself that
1 is on trial."
The Morning Post declares that "the
; mitigation of the sentence will be ln
j terpreted all over the world as cvi
i dence that the judges who condemned
MOODY PRAYS
FOR DREYFUS
NEW YORK, Sept. 10.â
Among Rev. Mr. Moody's con
gregation in Plymouth Church
this morning were several dele
gates from Great Britain to
the International Congregational
Council, which will meet on Sep
tember 19 in Boston. Mr. Moody
asked the prayers of the con
gregation for Dreyfus and his
family and said: "I pity the
mun- or nation thy* .wTlt^ iitfefw:
prejudice to come into their
hearts against God's chosen
people. "We owe a great deal to
the sons of Abraham. All the
blessings we enjoy come through
that line. If any of you have
prejudices against them I be
seech you to tear them out.
From the bottom of my heart
I pity the man who has a preju
dice against another because he
is a Jew."
* Mr. Moody then offered a fer
vent prayer for Dreyfus and his
family. He prayed for such a
manifestation as would show
that there is still a God meting
out justice. Mr. Moody after
ward preached upon the doc
trine of atonement, which he
declared was the one thing
taught "in the Bible from Gene
sis to Revelations.
i Dreyfus really believed him innocent."
The Daily Telegraph says: "This in
; famous judgment disgraces France,
i dishonors her army, insults the Kaiser
i and offends the best principles of hu
manity. There seems nothing left for
1 France but a revolution, and a war
will reduce her to the level of Spain."
The Standard says: "We are watch
ing by the sick bed of a great nation,
none knowing what new and deadly
form the malady may assume."
The Times observes: "We do not
hesitate to pronounce it the greatest
and most appalling prostitution of jus
tice the world has witnessed in mod
ern times. All the outrageous scan
dals which marked the course of the
trial pale into insignificance beside the
crowning scandal of the verdict."
The Daily Mail says: "Rennes is
France's moral Sedan."
The Dally Graphic says: "The
Rennes verdict will live forever as the
supreme effort of human wrong-head
edness."
INDIGNATION OF THE
REVISIONIST PRESS
PARIS, Sept. 10.â The revisionist
press comments upon the verdict with
deepest indignation, declaring that the
battle between the civil and military
courts will continue until the victory
rests with the Court of Cassation.
The Slecle has opened a subscription
to erect an expiatory monument in
front of the Palace of Justice at
Rennes to remind future generations
of this outrage of justice.
The Temps, referring to the rumor
that thÂ« members of the court-martial
signed a recommendation to mercy,
but only as regards the degradation of
the military rank, says the mere men
tion of extenuating circumstances
proves that the judges had a doubt of
which the accused should have received
the benefit, and it urges the revision
ists to remember that, in order to de
mand justice from the country, it Is
necessary first of all to act with calm
ness.
The Gauloia says: "A great move
ment of Rennaissance will spring from
the Dreyfus case."
GREAT INDIGNATION
EXPRESSED IN LONDON
LONDON. Sept. 11.â It would be dif
ficult to describe adequately the indig
nation the verdict of the Dreyfus
court-martial has evoked everywhere
in England. The excitement In the
Jewish quarters of London is only
natural. Special prayers were offered
throughout Saturday In all the syna
gogues on behalf of Dreyfus, and as
soon as the verdict was known. Jews
i and Jewesses were seen at every street
i corner, expressing execration and
i many sobbing bitterly.
At the music halls, especially the
I Palace Theater, where cinematog-aph
pictures of the incidents and leading
actors of the Dreyfus affair were ex
-1 hibited, the news was received with
I groans and hisses. In the French
quarter of London there was much ex
citement, accompanied by street fight
ing. In almost all the places of pub
lice worship pulpit references were
made to the verdict.
Canon Scott-Holland at St. Paul's
Cathedral said: "A nation is on its
trial. France stands at the iudement
bar. All civilization is waiting to know
whether to-morrow's news may add
anything to qualify the naked cruelty
of a bare telegram, anything to relieve
the staggered consciences."
Rev. Hugh Price Hughes, the well
known Wesleyan divine, preached at St.
James Hall. He said: "Five unhappy
Judges have already taken their places
in the judgment of the human race be
side Judas. Pilate. Judge Jeffries and
other creatures. They have sentenced
thHr victim to a decade of imprison
ment, but they have decreed
themselves forever to the scorn, de
rision and execration of the human
race. Unless France shakes off this in
famy, she will be left without an ally
or friend."
Rev. Arthur Robins, chaplain in or
dinary to the Queen, preaching at Holy
Trinity. Windsor, said: "The civilized
world is aghast at this great crime of
five abject judgrs.'
DEMANGE WILL SUBMIT
SOME LEGAL QUESTIONS
PARIS, Sept. 10, 9 p. m.â The day
has been one of absolute quiet, with no
public excitement, even in the Rue de
Chabrol. There was a rainfall this
afternoon, and the streets were practi
j cally deserted.
Slight disturbances occurred yester
day at Marseilles and Belfort after the
verdict of the Dreyfus court-martial
was published. The demonstrators
stoned the residence of Jacques Drey
fus, brother of the condemned, at Bel
fort, breaking the windows and other
wise damaging the structure. Many
persons were arrested at both places.
The Premier, M. "Waldeck-Rousseau,
was visited this morning by most of
j his colleagues. The date of the next
i Cabinet Council has not yet been fixed.
| President Loubet will probably not re
turn from Ramboullet for several days.
To-morrow M. Demange will visit
M. Waldeck-Rousseau and submit
a number of legal questions
arising out of the trial. A
j semi-official note has been issued de
nying the assertion of the morning
papers that the Minister of Foreign
Affairs, M. Delcasse, transmitted to
I Colonel Jouaust, the president of the
court-martial, through M. Paleologue,
Friday, a statement by the Reichsan
zeiger repeating the disavowals of
Count yon Munster and Count yon
Buelow of German relations with Drey
! fus. TV note also denies that M. Del
| casse asked Germany to issue the
I statement. â¢

COURT-MARTIAL JUDGES
MAY PETITION LOUBET
NEW \ORK. Sept. 10.â A World
cable from Rennes says: A well
founded rumor is spreading that the
judges of the court-martial will them
selves sign a petition praying President
Loubet to pardon Dreyfus.
If this be true, this action and the in
explicable clause in the verdict citing
I "extenuating circumstances" clearly
I prove that five officers of the court con
victed Dreyfus while they were fully
convinced of his innocence.
It is almost ridiculous to repeat that
these five officers condemned Dreyfus
to exonerate the generals and to main
tain the prestige of the army. Accord-
Ing to the lights of these officers the
moral effect they desired has bee.n ac
complished by the conviction of Drey
fus. Now they will try to save him
from the ignominy and suffering that
the verdict entails.
VERDICT DESCRIBED AS
COWARDLY AND IMPOLITIC

Emperor Wililara, would have ren
PRISON YAWNS FOR
DISHONEST DIRECTORS
Grand Jury Will Investigate
Gedge and Conlon.
Exposure of Their Crookedness Hurries Them
to Cover While Colleague Kemp Is Driven
to Drinkâ Williar's Peculiar Action,
ANEW Grand Jury will be im
paneled to-morrow by Judge
Daingerfield, and one of the first
matters that will be brought to
its attention will be the latest j
School Board scandal. The jury will j
have goud material upon which to
work, and, if the duty is faithfully
done, there will be vacancies in the
educational department of the city
; caused by some of the directors in
! voluntarily changing their places of
''â  residence from San Francisco to the
State prison.
According to the admissions of Dr.
H. E. Gedge, he was offered a bribe
to permit the changing of the specifi
cations upon which bids for school
I supplies were based to give a certain
firm a cinch on the contract at figures
that meant the looting of the school
I funds. The School Director made no
I secret of the fact in discussing the
i matter with his friends, that no bribe
was too small for him to grab on to,
and that he was not built on the lines
j of a man who would allow $2000 to slip
through his fingers while he was in the
possession of his proper senses. Direc
tor Gedge has made the statement
j that he had to pay $800 of the bribe
; money to his colleague, J. J. Conlon,
for agreeing to the steal. He also as
serts that Conlon did not refuse the
: money.
Gedge and Conlon, according to the
! former's admissions, took advantage of
their positiuns as members of the com
mittee on supplies to make the deal,
and fixed the whole matter up in se
| cret sessions, of which the third mem-
I ber, William A. Kemp, was either not
i informed or from which he was re-
I quested to stay away by Phil Crim
mins. Kemp was not in the division
of the bribe. The reason is that he did
not know that the twenties were fly
ing about him. If they had been golden
kissing bugs he would have escaped mi
i jury. But this is no fault of his. He
i says himself that he would have liked
i to have been considered in the transac
tion, and feels like being kicked for al
lowing himself to be bunkoed out of the
boodle.
The members of the "push" found lit
tle to console them yesterday morn
ing after reading The Call's expose of
their crookedness. Gedge, who, ac
cording to his own boast, appropriated
the lion's share of the bribe money, hid
j himself during the day. He was n<>t
j proud of the position into which his
I own tongue had forced him and did
[ not frequent the haunts that knew him
j well. Conlon his colleauge, also dis-
I played his modesty by keeping out of
sight.
Kemp, who was left out of the deal,
and was not even given a chance to take
; any bad money, was in evidence early
in the day. When he began to "smell
a mouse" a couple of months ago, he
undertook the gigantic contract of
; drowning his sorrow in liberal potions
of the "real old stuff." Although he
has stayed faithfully with the job. the
contract is by no means fulfilled, so he
resumed operations yesterday morning
as soon as he saw a copy of The Call.
His parade along cocktail row was a
noble effort, but when he counter
marched and broke away from the
stereotyped order of "a little straight,
please," the mixture disagreed with
him and he retired in disorder. But
his sorrow was drowned for the day.
His mind was in such a condition at
the finish that he actually thought that
Gedge and Conlon Wad divided.
Gedge's admissions at this late date
explain the peculiar methods that
were adopted by the School Board at
the time the supplies contracts were
under consideration last June, and
which created considerable comment j
at the time. The opening of the bids j
at the meeting of May 31 was sur- I
rounded by such an air of secrecy and
mystery that suspicion was at once
created that "something was doing."
sjo one was allowed to see the figures
of the bids in the open meeting. Su
perintendent Webster opened them, ex
plained that the necessary certified
check accompanied each, and, under
instructions, gave out no other infor
mation. The reporters were not al- j
1 lowed to inspect the bids.
At the suggestion of the Supplies
j Committee â Conlon, Gedge and Kernp â
the proposals were referred to them. j
They had possession of the documents !
for two weeks. It is not charged that j
they altered any of the figures to suit ;
the favored ones, but they certainly !
had the opportunity, and men who ac- I
cept bribes and boast about it might
have no compunction about a little '
thing like changing the figures in a
bid to the detriment of some honest
bidder. But this was not done, there i
being no necessity for such action, for i
the reason that the specifications had
already been tampered with so that i
no one but the bidder who was to pay I
the bribe could possibly win, and that
was all that Gedge cared about and
all that interested Conlnn.
Kemp, as has been stated, did not '
dered impossible the repetition of
what is described as "one of the
greatest judicial and political crimes
of any age."
It is universally agreed that the
second verdict is a grave political
blunder, a violation of the laws of
civilization, and an act of moral cow
ardice which the world will find it dif
ficult to pardon.
The German press unanimously de
scribes the verdict as cowardly and
impolitic, not to say criminal.
The Cologne Gazette says: "It is a
cowardly verdict, in the barbarous
spirit of the Middle Ages. By this
crime the judges have Imposed a line
oÂ£ demarkation between France and
the rest of the world, which, although
it will not prevent diplomatic inter
course and stay the common exchange
of products, will, according to all the
notions of right, justice, honor, toler
ance and ethics which the civilized
world bears with it in the twentieth
century, form a barrier only to be re-
I moved by time and laborious effort.
PBICE FIVE CENTS.
figure in this, much to his regret, but
he came in heavy at the finish, when
there was an opportunity for a little
grand stand play, and unwittingly
gave the first hint that there was a
scandal of some kind in the ink and
paper contracts.
The committee recommended that the
bid of Payot, Uph&m & Co. for that
class of goods be accepted. Their fig
ures on ink were 15 cents a gallon
higher than those of Brown & Potter,
and on paper 30 cents a ream higher
than the bid of the latter firm.
A man named H. R. Williar had been
called in by (Jedge and Conlon to ex
pert the samples of paper offered, and
he recommended the Golden Gate
brand handled by Payot, Upham &
Co., which was specifically mentioned
in the specifications. This was one of
the changes that barred many bidders.
It developed later that this man Williar
was the representative of the manufac
turers of the Golden Gate paper, which
was handled exclusively by Payot, Up
ham & Co., and it was nothing more
than natural that he, in the capacity
of expert for Gedge and Conlon, should
recommend it, to the exclusion of ail
other brands. These charges concern
ing Williar were set forth in a letter
from the Union Pulp and Paper Com
pany, which Kemp produced at one of
the board meetings he did attend.
Brown & Potter offered a paper made
by the Union Paper Company, from
whom they received figures before they
made their bid. They also offered
Penniwell's ink, a home production,
which previous contractors had substi
tuted for a higher-priced article, speci
fied in their agreement and for which
they were charging. Brown & Potter
offered it at 50 cents a gallon. Payot,
Upham & Co. were awarded the con
tract to furnish Stanford Ink at 65 cents
a gallon. Brown & Potter were anxious
to comply with the specification and
furnished figures on Golden Gate paper,
but Williar, the agent of the manufac
turers, refused to sell them any of it.
Members of the firm of Payot, Up
ham & Co. deny that they or any one
representing them bribed the Supplies
Committee of the Board of Education.
H. R. Williar, who posed as the com
mittee's expert, and whose employers
in the East profited by the award of
the contract to Payton, Upham & Co.,
could not be found yesterday or last
evening, and consequently could
neither deny or affirm any suspicion
that may exist that he is the man who
paid the $2000 to School Director Gedge.
The Call did everything possible
yesterday to give Gedge and Conlon
an opportunity to make whatever
statements or explanations they de
sired in connection with the case.
Neither of the men could be found;
none of their friends or relatives would
acknowledge that they knew their
whereabouts or when they would come
out of hiding. Inquiries at the Gedge
residence, 1162 Jackson street, elicited
the information that the School Di
rector had left home in the morning,
stating that he would not return dur
ing the day or night. No one in the
house knew when he would be back,
if at all. The father of Director Con
lon was seen last evening at the fam
ily residence, 1363 Eddy street. He said
that his son was not at home, and that
he did not know where he was or when
he would return.
HEAD EXPECTED IT.
One Director Not at All Surprised at
The Call's Expose.
SANTA CRUZ, Sept. 10.â Concerning
the charges made against School Director
Gedge in The Call of this morning 1 . School
Director Ed Head has to say the fol
lowing:
"What I and others in a position to
know have expected has come to pass,
as we forecasted Gedge's finish when his
raw work first came into evidence in con
nection with the Ginn contract for copy
books. That contract was considered in
an executive session of the board, and
Gedge's anxiety that it be awarded was
..lent that he was openly flouted by
different members. He buttonholed ev
ery member and nulled every wire he
could get hold of to win it out.
"I was one of the first sacrifices to the
necessity for such a tool as Gedge has
proved to be. He was given his nomina
tion by Crimmins and, Kelly, and it was
offered him by Ed Williams. Chief Clerk
of the Justices' Court, their City Hall
lieutenant. When I was chairman of the
Supplies Committee that combination ap
proached me on different propositions,
and found they cnuld do nothing with me.
They generally came at me through this
man Kemp. He made no direct proposi
tions, but grot at his point clearly enough
to find thee was nothing doing with me.
As a result of it I lost my job as chair
man of the Supplies Committee.
"I can make n*o direct charges against
Gedge; there are other members of the
board who intend to do that. The so
called 'club flush' neglects the business
end of things in their desire 'to improve

WASHINGTON, Sept. 10. â Admiral
Bradford, chief of the Bureau of Equip
ment, has been informed that Slgnor
Marconi will come to Washington to dis
cuss with him the proposed experiments
with wireless telegraphy to be conducted
by the American navy.
Slgnor Marconi will bring with him a
complete wireless telegraphy equipment,
which will be used In the proposed exper
iments. The inventor is expected to arrive
in the course of a few weeks.
As soon as Bignor Marconi and his In
struments are here Admiral Bradford will
recommend to the department that one of
the vessels of the navy be set aside for
experimental work. It is proposed to
place a receiver on the shore, and the
warship will communicate with It at vary
ing distances. By this means it Is believed
the system can be developed and the value
of It definitely determined.
If the experiments are a success it is
not unlikely that the navy will be
equipped with Instruments so that prompt
communication can be had between ves
sels or between vessels and the shore.

LABORERS GAIN
A BIG POINT
Trouble of Planters in
Hawaii.
FORCED TO RELEASE MEN
GALICIANS WHO HAD VIOLATED
THEIR CONTRACTS.
Having Been Imprisoned, Publ'c
Opinion Grew So Strong That the
Employers Were Forced to
Free Them.
HONOLULU, Sept. 2.-This afternoon
will long l" ;i memorable cue in the an
nuls of Hawaii, not merely because it
curiously happen* to coincide with tlie
tixty-flrsi anniversary of the birth of ex-
Queeh Liliuolcalani, luu because the
pressure of public opinion has won a
grand victory in obtaining the release by
tbe Oafau Bugar Plantation Company of
the thirty-six Qallclan contract laborer*
Imprisoned In Oahu jail for violatinK
their contracts.
Jt will he remembered that in November
of last year 42 out of a hatch of Jim Cali
clans were arrested under the slavery
penal contract labor laws fur deserting
Contract service. They were fined and
Imprisoned until they were willing; to re
turn to that service. They declined to
return to work, preferring to work upon
the roads in the striped suits of me con
vict until, at 1 o'clock to-day, they were
released.
For some time past the cancellation of
the contracts and the release of the men
have been considered by the managers of
the Oahu plantation and the Planters'
Supply Association. Then the more virile,
if savage, attacks -of the Sunday Volcano
Increased popular Indignation, but when
The Call added Its Influence in attacking;
the nefarious system It was soon known
and felt that tne planters would have to
BUCCUmb and establish what Minister of
Interior King, president of the Hoard
of Immigration, deem* a very bad. dan
gerous and far-reaching precedent in the
release of these men.
The Government and Messrs. 11. Hack
feld & Co., agents of the Oahu planta
tion, have for some short time past been
in negotiation .f the term Is noi Inappro
priati for the release, but until last
evening the details could not bo arranged,
as the Government had no power to act
except under the terms of an absolute
request for their release by the parties in
terested In placing them in jail.
The directors of the Oahu plantation
met, and In view of the serious probable
effects upon plantln Interests In general,
Itea the uirectorate of the Ranters*
Association, who advised the action as
esslon to public opinion. The result
was a statement to the Government that
the Oahu Company would have no objecÂ«
tlon to the release of the prisoners if
the Government Bhould see m to take
such a st.",v The Government notified
the plantation thai this communication
did not afford them sufficient basis upon
which to act. This morning Mr. E. Buhr,
managing director for H. Hackfeld &
Co., forwarded a letter containing an
unq lallfled request (or the release of the
men, and Attorney-General Cooper
promptly gave th< necessary Instructions
for their release
The plantation will be the loser of the
sums advanced to the men, amounting
to something over $6000. They are also
willing to give them work, but under con
tract. If the men are willing to work
they can obtain it with several contract
ors in road building, at which they are
now adepts; but If they prefer to loaf
the vagrancy laws will be enforced
against them.
There was a slight demonstration when
the men paraded the streets after their
release, and the supporters of Mr. Sewall
are endeavoring to make political capital
out of It as against the Dole faction.
Monday next, being Labor day. will be
duly observed here for the first time us
a seml-hollday.
EDITOR FRANCIS SAYS
DREYFUS MAY ESCAPE
BOSTON, Sept. 10.â M. Francis, one of
i the editors of the Paris Figaro, was in
Boston when the fact of Dreyfus' con
demnation and Bentence came in. When
asked what the general sentiment in
France was. he said:
"The thinking men all over France.
do matter how much they may have
thought him guilty, expected that on
'â  the grounds Of expediency he would
never he adjudged guilty. They thought
that the fear of a revolution would pre
vent such a finding by the court-mar
tial. I would not be surprised if at this
, minute Paria was in an uproar ami a
revolutionary mob sweeping through
I her streets. There may be one, two or
; throe generals killed. It would not sur
! prise me. Is this the end? It is only
the beginning, it is the end of the
DreyfUl case, as far as that goes. That
is to say, he can never again appeal
it and the Court of Cassation will have
no further jurisdiction over it. Hut it
is the beginning of all sorts of trouble.
; The case will become a matter of re
! ligion and a religious war. The Jew?
will spend their last cent to find out
the truth, and it may land on the gen
erals. The Jews do nut care who their
investigation strikes.
"What docs the sentence of ten years
â  in prison mean?" and he shrugged his
rhoulders. "That means a year. He
will be sent, probably, to a military
prison in Africa, and if he Is not killed
within a year, a way will be opened for
him to get away and safe into another
land."
"Will the Cabinet make any move
in the matter? What will the Cabinet
do if there Is a revolution?"
Sinip'y disappear; go away. We
j change our cabinets as you put on and
| take off a coat."
AFRAID TO SEND THE
EXHIBITS TO PARIS
BUDAPEST, Hungary, 10.â The
following semi-official statement has
been issued: ....
A move is on foot against sending ex
hibits to the Paris exposition in 1900. Many
Intending exhibitors have withdrawn their
notices of participation, on the 'ground
that the present state of things in France
renders it unsafe to send exhibits. Th,o
Cathedral Chaptre of Gran; capital of the
country of the Bane name on the Dan
ube, and the residence of the Catholic
primate of Hungary, have. canceled their
decision to send exhibits, giving as a rea
son its unwillingness. to endanger works
of art worth millions of francs.

<â¢â¢ Johnson a visit with the intention of buying some chickens. The two J
* men were standing watching the antics of a number of sea lions on a *
t reef where their rookery is situated, when they became aware that S
% something unusual was going on. The sea lions began to bellow and |
* all dived into the water except one huge fellow, who stood his ground |
* and appeared to be watching something. In a moment the cau Â«f "'^ *

* They pounced upon the big fellow, and a struggle Immediately en- |

t a flipper off the sea lion, when, with a horse bellow of anger the wounded *

ADMIRAL DEWEY
HOMEWARD BOUND
Cruiser Oiympia Leaves
Gibraltar.
GIBRALTAR, Sept 10.â The United
States cruiser Olympia with Admiral
Dewey aboard sailed this afternoon for
New York.
(ALL HEADQUARTERS, WELLING
TON HOTEL. WASHINGTON. Sept. 10.â
Admiral Dewey's <!â¢ parture from Gibral
tar to-day is earlier than officials had ex
pected. Their latest information concern
ing the Olympia's Itinerary indicated that
she would not sail from Gibraltar much
before the middle of the present week,
but It is supposed the time of leaving the
British port lias been expedited In order
that the vessel may certainly arrive at
New York upon the date spt by the re
cepti vi committee and assented to by the
Admiral.
Admiral Dewey will decide for himself
what route he will follow in crossing the
Atlantic. No advices on this point have
been received by the department. It is
believed, however, that tne Olympia will
follow the great circle route, stopping at
the Azores for coal. Officials who know
the Admiral say New York should not
expect him before September 28, the date
b< ; aa thai anon which the Olympia
should arrive tÃSre.
It is presumed that the Olympia will
spend a couple of days at the Azores and
loiter on her route, so as to use up the
eighteen daya remaining of the Admiral's
homeward voyage.
Rear Admiral Sampson with the North
Atlantic Squadron will sail from Phila
delphia this week for New York, where
he will e,,mi>l< to the arrangements for
Admiral Dewey's reception.
GENERAL MERCIER
BURNED IN EFFIGY
NEW YORK. Sept. 10.â Indign.ftion
over the reconviction of Dreyfus mani
fested Itself to-day in many ways. Gen
eral Mercler was burned in effigy in
Eldridge street; there was a big pro
test meeting of Jews in the Thalia
Theater; many preachers referred' to
the trial in their sermons, and prepar
ations were made for an appeal to
Washington.
In the burning of the effigy there
wan no organized attempt to rouse the
public opinion. Several young men
made the effigy of straw, soaked with
kerosene. A mask with a big mus
tache and a cap completed the fig
ure. The effigy was fastened to two
upright, poles with wire. On the breast
were placards, reading : "General
Mercier," 'French Justice," and "Hon
est Witness."
â ' The meeting nt the Thalia Theater
was impressive in its earnestness. The
house was crowded to the doors, al
though admission was charged. Sev
eral times the police had to clear the
lobby after the sale of tickets was
stopped.
Invitations were sent to-day to lead
ing citizens and clerarymen, irrespec
tive of race and. religion, to take part
in a great Dreyfus protest meeting,
which will be held this week in

in relation to the emigration of the
peasantry of Northern Italy to the
Islands under labor contracts with trie
planters Mr Damon, when questioned

is not on his way to Italy and that he is
not taking an active interest in the immi
gration problem. â¢
Alatau T. Atkinson, special agent of

Klo He is golnp to Washington to con
sult with Ex-Governor Merriam of Min

Special Dispatch to The Call.
MEXICO CITY, Sept. 10.â Private ad
vices received from Brazil show that the
Government* here has been greatly In
fluenced by the accounts regarding the
alleged secret understanding between the
Holiviun and the United States Govern
ments by which the latter power was to
take over the territory on the upper
Amazon claimed by Bolivia, a region rich
in rubber. It is alleged In Rio de Janeiro
that American naval officers have recon
noitered and roughly surveyed the re
gion and sent their secret reports to
Washington. It is first charged that Mr.
Bryan, United States Minister to Brazil,
was a party to the agreement with Bo
livia, but it is now said that the Bolivian
secret agent, named Uthoff, made the
agreement with the United States Consul
at Para. There is some doubt about this,
but such is the belief of the Brazilian
newspapers and people, and the Argen
tine press has begun, instigated by Euro
pean residents, to set up the cry that the
colossus of the north is moving south
ward and intends to control and ulti
mately annex all South America, and so
diligent has been the propaganda of this
story that the newspapers in Mexico of
the clerical stripe have taken it up edi
torially, predicting the absorption of all
this hemisphere by the greedy and land
hungry Americans, who are acquiring j
lands in Brazil and Peru, and who will
BOon be able to afford the Washington j
Government a pretext for attempting to i
overthrow the South American Govern
ments.
The Buenos Ayres Standard, controlled !
l# British subjects, asserts that Presi
dent Roea's visit to Brazil was to consult
with the President of that country with ;
a view to, mutual defense against the j
Yankees. There is no doubt that the
Spanish and European Governments gen
erally have given their organs in Latin-
America the hint to publish articles de
signed to embitter South and Central
America against the United States and j
Its people and break up the growing senti- \
ment in favor of Pan-Americanism, which !
l.s greatly dreaded by European commer- j
cial interests so strongly intrenched In
South America, where American inter- j
ests have few newspaper champions and j
defenders. It is shrewdly calculated that
by persistent newspaper attacks on the j
United States that the Americans can be
got into high disfavor, and that con
cessions will be refused them.
The journey of William McElroy Cur
tis, formerly of the Bureau of American |
Republics, to Peru and Bolivia is report
ed to be in the nature of a secret mission
for his Government. There is a profound- j
ly suspicious sentiment developing In
Latin-American circles regarding the de- I
signs of the United States, whose power j
is dreaded and whose administration is i
accused of cherishing imperialistic pro
jects on this continent. Ihe remarkable j
unanimity of the Mexican clerical sheets i
and the "South American journals of all
Classes in dealing with this matter makes ;
it clear that it is a prearranged cam- j
paign with a' view to exciting ill-will
against the Americans of the great repub- j
lie of North America.

Sept. 10. â Considerable progress has
been made by Major General Otis upon
the plan of campaign he will inaugu

the dry season.

SUGAR BEET MAY BE
GROWN IN MARIN COUNTY
Successful Experiments Made by
Farmers in the Vicinity of
Tomales.
TOMALES. Sept. 10.â The success the
i farmers of this section "i" Marin County
have met with in the experimental cul
ture of sugar beets has been so pro
nounced that many have concluded to
cultivate the beets on a large scale, and
it is prophesied that within a short
period Marin County will number sugar
beets among Its most valuable products.
There are at least 10,000 acre? of land
along the line of the North Pacific Coast
Railroad especially adapted to sugar beet
culture, which to-day would bring hardly
fc'ij an acre as an investment, but if plant
ed in sugar eta would bring forth that
sum in rental. : **-:'' i*
J^ast week K. Y. Kaaf. outside superin
tendent of the California and Hawaiian
Sugar Refining Company, paid this place a
visit for the purpose of inspecting the
b<>et fields He visited the ranches of
Messrs. Partori. irbank. Bailey, Bas
s.-tt Hubbell; Wood worth and Nolan, and
pronounced the beets growing thereon in-
U nor to none he had ien in the course
of his lor.g experience in beet culture. In
his opinion the tonnage of the Melds he
Inspected would be about 22V4 to the acre.
He stated that the land at Point Reyes,
Millerton and Marshalla would grow beets
high in purity and rich in sugar. This
opinion irom an expert has made the
farmers Jubilant, and J. W. Keys, the
nio?t ardent advocate of the industry,
wl>o induced the farmers to make the ex
jio!im<-nt and himself Bet the example, is
i being congratulated on all sides.
In order to show the growers the best
way of cultivating the beets the company
represented by Mr. Raaf has decided to
rent three hundred acres of land near
this town and plant thorn in beets. Next
year it Is expected that fully a thousand
acres will be' under cultivation.
The narrow gauge railway officials
have done everything in their power to
foster the growing Industry and will give
a rate of ", â  nts per ton to San Quentin,
with a probability of a reduction as the
t-nfflo Increases. From San Quentin the
beets! will be shipped to the factory at
Crockett on Largos. It is expected that
about ten carloads â ...â¢ill be shipped during
the present month.
The presideni of the beet company has
Informed Attorney Keys that if the farm
ers will guarantee to plant 8000 acres in
beets a factory will be erected here. This
amount of land can be easily procured
throughout the Valley Ford, Bloomfleld

stood to be the intention of the admin
tration to enforce a strict blockade of
Filipino ports. This action has been
considered upon th<? recommendation
of Rear Admiral Watson, who has
called attention to the amount of sup
plies which the Insurgents have been
receiving. No instructions have as yet
been sent to him to enforce a block
ade but his vessels are stationed at
various purls for the purpose of pre
venting any military supplies from
reaching Ag-uinaUio. The blockade
! which will be enforced will be munici
! pal in character, so as to prevent any
! foreign nation seizing upon the block
| ade if it were formally declared, as a
: protest for the recognition of the Fili-
I pinos as belligerents.
General Haywood, commandant or
the Marine Corps, said to-day that he
expects there will be more than TOO
men under Colonel Pope's command
within the next few months. There
have been consultations between Rear
Admiral Watson and General Otis re
specting operations to be conducted by
the marines, and it is understood that
they will bo given the province of
Cavite in which to operate. Cavite Is
the hotbed of the insurrection, and the
work of the marines will have to be
supplemented by the army, but the use
\>i ('"lonel Pope's command will enable
the concentration of practically the en
tire military force in subjugating
Aguinaldo.
It is apparent from the plan of cam
paign prepared by General Otis that
his duty will be more of a supervisory
j and supplying character than anything
: else. He will remain in Manila, send
ing supplies and troops to the front and
keeping the two divisions in the best
possible condition, but the military op
i erations themselves will be directed by
â  the division commanders. Of course
General Otis will be charged with the
responsibility, but it is evident that the
administration is quite satisfied to trust
the conduct of field operations to Gen
eralÃ Mac Arthur and Lawton.

them, and their vociferous rooting, to
gether with a score of 19 to 3, did not
put the locals in a happy frame of
mind. The townspeople took their
drubbing good-naturedly, though, and
to-night the local team is out showing
the Dudes that the knowledge of base
ball they may lack is more than made
up in their proficiency in the art of for
getting a defeat.
The Daughters entertained all day.
From early in the morning until the
last train left the different parlors kept
dropping in to either say good-by or
announcing their intention of staying
over for the fetes to-morrow.
Ralph Miller, who la acting as clam
bake editor, was busy all day playing
the hose on the 50,000 his Japanese
divers gathered for him at Monterey
two days ago. To-morrow after the
fire has gone out these bivalves will be
as fresh and palatable as anything an
able-bodied native ever went up
against.
Precita Parlor of San Francisco got
at them to-day. The entire dele
gation was led. and the results will
have to be looked for at the other end
of the line, as the parlor's representa
tives took the train home as soon as
they had finished the feed.
The big: dam, which is just now work
ing overtime in making a big and beau
tiful lake of the San Ixtrenzo River,
broke down a night or so ago, and the
committee that has charge of the car
nival arrangements has been com
placently dumping several hundred dol
lars more into it in order that there
may be enough water to float the gor
geous barges that are being made
ready for to-morrow night's carnival.
There is now no possible chance of an
other disaster of that sort. The dam
has been mended so that it will stand
until the strain of the winter freshet
comes, and there is nearly enough
water in the lagunita to float the
lowa.
That particular stretch of the San
Lorenzo Resembles Market street on the
night of the illumination. Incandes
cent lights of every hue are strung
across it and hung in graceful festoons
along the banks. The barge which has
been prepared for Miss May Baldwin,
the Queen, and her maids of honor, is
an electrical marvel. Nearly a hun
dred boats have been decorated and
made ready for tl.e big water pageant,
and hundreds of dollars' worth of fire
works are ready to be touched off.

THREE MASKED MEN HOLD
UP AN EXPRESS TRAIN
Robbers Blow Open the Safe at an
Arizona Station and Take to
the Hills With Their Booty.
PHOENIX. Ariz.. Sept. 10. â The
Southern Pacific west-bound express
was held up at 12 o'clock last night
as the train stopped at Cochise, a small
station eleven miles west of Willcox.
There were three masked robbers in
the gang. Deputy United States Mar
shal J. P. Welles was a passenger on
the train, and he at o*nce telegraphed
to "Willcox and organized a posse,
which is now in pursuit of the rob
bers.
Mr. George Brown arrived in Phoe
nix this morning and told the story
of the hold-up. He said that it was
the cleanest robbery ever known by
the railroad men. As the train stopped
at Cochise, Messenger Adair, who was
the same messenger held up on the
Southern Pacific a few months ago
when he shot one of the robbers,
opened the door of the express car,
when one of the robbers shoved a six
shooter into his face and demanded
him to come out of the car. Another
robber held up the engineer and fire
man, and a third man took care of the
conductor of the train. It was all
done so quietly that the passengers
did not know what occasioned the de
lay at the station. The express car
was cut from the balance of the train
and the engineer was ordered to pull
the car down the track a mile and a
half. There the robbers placed two
sticks of dynamite upon the safe and
touched them off. The explosion burst
the safe to pieces and tore a hole in
the expreses car. After the bandits
had gathered up the money sacks they
FUNERAL OF THE LATE
JAMES BIDDLE EUSTIS
Services Will Be Held in Newport and
the Body Will Be Shipped to
Louisville.
NEWPORT, R. 1., Sept. 10.â The funeral
of James B. Eustis, former United States
Embassador to France, will take place
Monday evening from the home of the
deceased In Eustis avenue. A short
Episcopal service will be conducted by
Rev. Henry Morgan Stone, rector of the
Trinity Church, and then the body will
be taken by boat to New York and thence
to Louisville. Ky.. where it will be buried
beside the remains of Mrs. Eustis. The
body will be accompanied by James B.
Eustis Jr., a son, and William Eustis,
a nephew. Brief committal services will
be held at Louisville.
There were many callers at the Eustis
cottage to-day offering condolence and
leaving flor.il tributes.
Mr. Eustis' review of the Dreyfus case,
with which he had been occupied during
the summer, had been so far completed
that it needed only the concluding chap
ter, and that chapter would have been
finished in the reconviction of Dreyfus
Saturday. Mr. Eustis did not live to
write it.

THE COMMERCIAL SITUATION
SIGNS of the great prosperity now enjoyed by
the United State? continue to multiply. One
the latest is the bulletin of the New York
Bureau of Labor Statistics, which makes the best
showing of any document over issued by that depart
ment. It shows that the percentage of labor unem
ployed in that State is less than i per cent, and in
some trades none at all is reported. When the vast
tion of New York i- considered this is cer
tainly a wonderful exhibit.
There is a wide difference in prosperity based on
tion and that based Â»n a genuine demand for
manufacture.! products, and the litter condition is the
one prevailing to-day. As previously mentioned, the
purchasing demand of the country was never as active
as now. Nor is this demand for goods confined to
the Unit< d States. The export trade of the country
continue- extremely heavy, and our manufacturers
tending their trade in directions little dreamed
of a few year- ago. At that time nobody thought
that England and Germany would enter our markets
for locomotives and bridges, but they have, and are
so well satisfied with their initial purchases that they
have sent other orders. A> for our exports from
Ist, they were never livelier than to-day. It is
not a question of selling the goods to foreign coun
tries hut of finding vessels in which to send them
away. Every day large shipments to the Orient and
Pacific islands are declined by the different compa
nies and individual vessels for want of room to ac
commodate them.
The leading mercantile and financial authorities of
the East see nothing in sight to cause distrust, bat
all seem to take a rosy view of the situation. Some
of them are looking tor increased dividends on their
railway shares owing to the larger earnings of the
companies, though most of them have learned not
to count their chickens before they are hatched, es
pecially in Wall street. Meanwhile the great staples
of ih<' country continue to show an active and firm
â  â  cry few days prices go up, one of the la
being in paper. As for metals, the advance
in pigiron, copper and tin since the current wave of
prosperity struck the country a year or more ago
from 50 to 100 per cent. Thus far the ad
vanced prices have not checked the demand in any
line, and, in fact, prices often appear to be a second
ary consideration, delivery alone being the impor
tant point in purchases. Conservative men, however,
know that sooner or later this tremendous buying of
merchandise all over the country must satisfy the de
mand, and when that happens there will be a reaction
of some kind. It is not in sight yet, however.
The local markets exhibit few striking features.
The great farm staples remain about as they were a
week ago, grains being quiet and fruit active and
firm. Wool and hops are quiet, but strong as to
quotations, while hides and leather are firm with ?
demand. The tendency in oils is upward, and
coal oil lias advanced during the past week. Pro
are slow, but steady in price. Lumber and
coal are in moderate supply and quick demand at firm
quotations.
Some localities report a better inquiry for real es
tate, though there is no activity anywhere. The
money market is in its normal condition, and sol
vent borrowers find no drf.lculty in securing funds <U
moderate rates of interest. There are no large fail
ures reported, and collections are fair in all quarters.
The net supply of gold in the United States Treasury
has risen to the highest point ever known, touching
$251,618,000 on Thursday of last week, the previous
! record having been $217,000.0000 in August.
In view of the reÂ«urrection of the old gold
ver question by the political parties this is an
resting and instructive fact.
Major General Lawton says that the Filipinos are
much better than Indians. And the general is not
ignorant of the fact that the American definition of
:i t(ood Irraian is a dead one.
It appears now that the North Star is in reality
three stars. It speaks volumes for the sobriety of
nr.tronomers that this fact had not been suspected long
ago.
BRYAN ON HOGS AND MEN.
IN his rural speech at the State Fair in Sacramento
.Mr. Bryan said: "You turn a hog loose, and it it
is worth only a dollar or two somebody will see
in it value enough to justify caring for the hog, and
[yet all over this State you will find people drifting
from place to place and many seeming unconscious
lof thiir sufferings and indifferent to their welfare. I
want to suggest if you want to develop the re
sources of your State you had better give attention to
â¢ i eople as well as to cattle and hogs.
Mr. Bryan entered the State a few days ago, tar
ried and spoke at Sacramento, went to Stockton and
spoke, went on to the Yo^emite and came back to
Wawona and spoke, came down to San Francisco
| and spoke and then went back to Sacramento to de- j
j liver an address at the State Fair. The whole ad
dress illustrated his lack of versatility, for it was an
intensely partisan harangue, to a mixed crowd on a
non-partisan occasion. Any other public man in the j
| Union would have dropped partisan politics in such j
j a presence, and spoken from the inspiration of what j
the labor and genius of man have wrought.
The only inspiration Mr. Bryan seems to have
j t?ken from it was an impulse to slander the State in j
i the remarks we have quoted. It was the best he
| had to say for California, and worse has never been !
j said of any State and its people. Standing upon the
! eminence to which his candidacy for the Presidency ,
' and his desire to run again put him. he informs the
' world, in an grammatical language, that in this State ,
1 stray hogs are fed and stray men left to starve! He i
I says that all over California men are drifting from j
! place to place and there is indifference to their suf- i
ferings, while hogs are cared for and fed.
In his view the State seems in need of develop- j
'. inent. and is suffering from paying too much atten- :
I tion to hogs and too little to men. Looking around
! him in the grounds of the State Fair and to the pa
vilion filled with the fruits of the vineyard, orchard
and field, and with the results of bur manufacturing
skill, he seems to have seen in it all no evidence of the ;
development of our resources. It did not occur to
him that all this was an expression of our civilization
and illustrated the remarkable progress of a State
that is only in its fiftieth year. His inverted vision
saw only a State filled with tramps and these starving :
while our people give food and care to stray hogs!
Now the people want to know where he found this
excess of human suffering "all over this State." and
I where he observed the callous indifference thereto. >
' How many people did he see "drilling" and "suffer
ing" and neglected while hogs were eating what be
longs to men? What evidence has he that we neg
lect men and give to hogs and cattle what belongs to
humanity? His speech is a falsehood and a slander.
It is not true that men are drifting and starving all j
over this State, or in any part of it. Mr. Bryan has
no vocation himself. He promotes no industry, hires
no men, pays no wages. He gets a living out of
politic-, by exploiting the ambitions and the greeds
of his fellow men who hope in his success to get the
gain of office and the pleasures of power. What
client has he had and what fee has he received as a
lawyer since 1806? What has he earned with his pen !
as a journalist in the last three years? What paid the
cost of his trip to this State and back? After slan
dering California in his Sacramento speech, he said:
"A few weeks ago I spent several days upon the lakes
in Michigan and Wisconsin, and I saw there the
summer homes lining the banks of those lakes, and
the thought that came to me was: How small a pro
portion of the people of this great land are able to
enjoy summer vacations. And the thought that pained
me the most was that the producers of the wealth of |
the nation have less time and money for summer va- 'â 
cations than any other class, and the thought came
to me. Is it a just Government?" Out of this jumble
of "thoughts" that "pained" the only conclusion is :
that a just Government would give everybody a sum
mer vacation! But what was Mr. Bryan doing on
the lakes? Is he a producer of wealth? If so nobody !
seems to have denied him about the longest vacation |
from labor that has been enjoyed by any man we :
know of. After a vacation "on the lakes a few weeks
ago" he has taken another here and visited the
Yosemite. The cost of it is not less than $500, if he 1
paid his way. He attacks our people and charges
them with feeding hogs and letting men starve all
over the State. They want to know how he gets the
money for a summer vacation that extends from the
Great Lakes to the Pacific Coast. When he comes
around and thinks thoughts that pain him. and sees
sights that make him sad. and tells the world that
Californians are indifferent to human suffering and let
men drift and starve while the hogs are fed and shel- j
tered. they want to know how Mr. Bryan gets the ,
money to travel around and criticize his fellow men .
who have summer homes in Wisconsin and raise hogs
and cattle in California? The man who sets himself
up as a censor of the humanity and charity of others
must show something more than demagogue pretense
and thoughts that pain him. What is he doing for i
humanity? How many that he saw drifting all over
this State did he relieve from his purse? What ex
ample of charity and humanity did he set to our "in
different" people? What tramp did he feed or :
clothe? Did he even find any hog besides himself
while he was in the State?
IMPORTED FRUIT IN THE ORIENT.
CONSUL A. B. JOHNSON in a report from
Amoy to the State Department gives some in
formation concerning the fruit trade in China
which it may be worth while for our fruit-packers and
shippers to study with some care. It appears from his
statement it is our own fault that European fruit
dealers are getting the bulk of a trade that ought to be
almost monopolized by the United States.
After pointing out that there is a large demand for
fruit in China and that the native crop has little or no
effect upon importation by reason of the comparative
\\orthlcssness of the fruit, the Consul says: "There
i e a steadily increasing demand among the natives for
foreign fruits, whether canned, dried or preserved.
The European population look to these imported
fruits almost exclusively to supply their tables,
l'nned pears, peaches and apricots come principally
from America, while preserved fruits, jams and dried
fruits still come largely from Europe. The reason is
apparent. The American manufacturer will not, or doe*
not, meet the conditions required. Since there are no
peaches or pears in Europe which can compete with
those from California, the Oriental merchant has no
choice: in other lines he is not =0 restricted. Prunes
and raisins are largely used. The dried fruit is put up

lin bottles and sealed. In no other way can it be
shipped to the tropics without great loss, as the hu
midity of the climate or insects will soon render it un
salable. No fruits, biscuits, crackers or any other
i food product can be safely shipped to Central or
Southern China or the Philippine Islands without
Icing sealed in glass bottles or tinned. The English
( and Continental merchants and manufacturers under
stand this and put up their fruits accordingly. If
tinned, the tins are either painted or varnished to pre
j vent rust and consequent loss to the merchant."
The time has gone by when our fruit men could
afford to ignore foreign markets. We have now a
' surplus crop every year in many kinds of fruit, and in
recent years have shipped considerable quantities
even to the fruit-growing countries of Europe. We
must now meet the requirements of the foreign de
, mand, and particularly that of China. Europe gets the
I trade because her dealers pack the fruit in the way the
| Oriental market demands it. In all probability a good
deal of American fruit after being shipped to England
i* manufactured and packed for the Chinese trade and
j sold there at a profit. Why should we not earn that
1 profit ourselves?
A MATTER FOR INVESTIGATION.
rACTS published in The Call yesterday concern
ing allegations of bribery and corruption in con
nection with the school supply contracts render
official investigation imperative. The late Grand Jury
in its final report declared that while the members
were morally certain of corrupt practices on the part
of some of the members of the former Board of Edu
cation, the Grand Jury was unable to frame indict
ments against thorn because of a lack of legal evi
dence. Better luck may attend an effort to bring to
punishment the men involved in the present scandal.
The evidence of bribery in connection with the
supply contracts conies to The Call through the talk
of erne of the principal parties to the fraud. Dr. H.
E. Gedge. chairman of the committee on supplies, has
admitted to at least one reputable citizen that an agent
of a firm intending to bid for the contracts offered
Sjoco for permission to inspect and make alterations
in the specifications of the supplies called for; that the
offer was accepted; that the specifications were
altered so as to give advantage to the firm; that the
money Avas paid and divided, $800 going to Conlon,
another member of the committee who was a full
party to the fraud.
It appears that Director W. A. Kemp, the third
member of the committee, was not aware of the trick
that was played out under his eye-, having been in
duced to let the scheme go through by his friend
Phil Crimmins, and thus he receive 1 no share of the
spoils. That part of the story may or may not be
trtie, for when interviewed on the subject Mr. Kemp
could not remember why he stayt d away from the
meeting when the contracts were let, nor why he di.l
not persist in his' original demand that the contracts
Ik let to the lowest bidder.
While the part played by Kemp may be involved in
doubt, there is on the face of the evidence a clear case
against Gedge and Conlon, for, as we have said, it is
presented upon statements made by Gedge himself to
at least one reputable citizen. Conlon seems to have
agreed to the scheme when first proposed, but left it
to Gedge to arrange the details. That is the testimony
The Call has made public, and if a fearless and thor
oughgoing Grand Jury enters upon an investigation
of the subject there is every reason to believe that not
only moral evidence but legal evidence will be forth
coming sufficient to justify the indictment of the
guilty parties.
Official corruption is bad in any department of gov
ernment, but it is most offensive to the public when
it occurs among men intrusted with the management
of the public schools. There was a great disappoint
ment when the corrupt members of the former board
managed to escape indictment, and the indignation of
the people made itself manifest at the next election by
turning them out of office. That form of punishment,
however, is not sufficient. The desire of the commun
ity is for a Grand Jury that will act upon the uncondi
tional motto of Grant. "Let no guilty man escape.''
THE COMING YACHT RACE.
SIXCE Sir Thomas Lipton has been in this
country he has won the favor of the people and
strengthened the already well assured belief that
the coming yacht race will be free from anything in
the way of personal ill feeling. It is to be contested
in the spirit of true sportsmanship and there will be
nothing like the ugly Dtmrayen incident to mar the
enjoyment of the match, whatever the result may be.
An evidence of the friendly disposition of the chal
lenger is afforded by the frank way in which he com
mented upon the complaints made by some dissatis
fied Englishmen upon the alleged interference of
steamers and other craft with the yachts. "It makes
me mad," he said, "when I hear so much stress laid
on this excursion steamer trouble, just as if such
things were unknown outside of America. We have
precisely the same trouble in our races at home. I
know, of course, that this habit of excursion steamer
captains is a bad business, but I say unhesitatingly
that it never prevented any English boat from win
ning the America's cup."
Declarations of that kind have done much to make
Lipton popular. It is clear we have to deal with a
big-hearted man. who has come here to win the fa
mous trophy if he can, and not to quibble over little
things and lay the foundations for accusing us of un
fairness if he lose. Such a man is apt to hold as well
as to win the favor of Americans, and it is safe to
say his words will make our yachting authorities
mofe eager to prevent the interference of excursion
steamers with the race than would any amount of
formal protesting and complaining.
It is not possible to forbid excursion steamers
going out to the race, and when once out on the open
ocean it will not be easy to make them obey regula
tions. The passengers on the steamers will of course
desire to be as near the yachts as possible, and the
officers will try to oblige them. The steamers will
have to avoid one another and all the other pleasure
craft, and there is always danger of interference. It
is to be hoped, however, that extra precautions will
be taken to prevent any such occurrence. We can
beat the British in yacht racing fairly, and have no de
sire to take unfair advantage. Our new challenger
has come to us frankly and with a spirit of cordial
good will, and it is for us to meet him on that plane.
Dispatches declare that American troops in Ne
gros recently marched a thousand feet up an almost
perpendicular slope under heavy fire. Uncle Sam
ought to provide wings for his soldiers or suffer
the consequences of overstocking the variety theaters
with human flies.

VIGOROUS PROTEST AGAINST EXAMINER'S
DISGRACEFUL SLANDER OF LARKSPUR CAMPERS
Editor of The Pallâ Dear Sir: The article upon the campers of Larkspur
appearing in Sunday's Examiner is one of the vilest and basest fabrications
that ever emanated from a human mind and the author one of the vilest curs
God ever, by accident or mistake, plact-d in the form of a man.
There is not one scintilla of truth in it from beginning to end, and if the
Examiner had taken the trouble t" investigate the truth of such an article
before publishing it instead of taking the word of the "resident on the hillside,"
who is a. stranger to truth, it never would have published it.
It is a vile stand* r upon some of the must respectable families in the State.
I Â»lÂ«fy the author to point to one instance where a man or woman has been in
sulted on the highway, 'lay or night, early or late, unless he be the culprit.
The utterance that men and women went bathing together in the creek
without bathing suits is a rank falsehood, unless the author was a party to
the act.
I have camped in Baltimore Canyon for the last seven years, and have seen
no such actions as the "resident on the hillside" described, and that was before
he knew there was such a place: and while each year has found a few undesirable
people, there wore no more, and, in fact, fewer than you usually find in a town
"f the like number of people, for nearly all the campers are composed of fam
ilies and their children. There has been noise at times, and lots of It; but the
people who made it were respectable. As for "Camp Occidental." each and
every one of them are young men of high standing in this community, and whose
character is of the best; and while I never visited their camp I met them all and
found them all gentlemen.
The Examiner has attacked the name of good women before, but when it
stoops to falsehood and reviles hundreds of respectable men and women without
investigating the truth of the assertions it becomes a stench in the nostrils of
decency; and in this instance it becomes the mouthpiece of a miserable wretch
and a coward who stoops to falsehood and insults womanhood to satisfy a per
sonal grudge. Yours truly, ROBERT D. DUKE,
San Francisco, Sept. 10. 404 Claus Spreckels building.

MINING THE RIVERS.
WHY MINE-JUMPERS LOST.
The mining- interests of the whole State
I have thoroughly wakened to the im
portance of the coming annual mating
of the American Institute of Mining i
Engineers in San Francisco, beginning I
on the 25th InsL and lasting three days,
to be followed by two weeks of sight
seeing in the mining regions.
The special train leaving Chicago on
the j'Hli Inst. will bring o-ver 200 members
and ciult.- Â» party <>f friends and many
other Western members will swell the at
tendance. The party will Btop at a few
mining- centers along the northern route
and will be met near the State line on
the 22d inst. by the reception committee
of the California Miners' Association In a
Bpecial car. ThÂ«- Institute has held many
important sessions attended by interest
ing excursions, but none "f Its annual
trips will hav< approached in extent,
variety of experience and royal hos
pitality the one of this year.
The California Miners' Association in
Sail Francisco and in the mining counties
is busy with reception plans, vice Presi
dent w. C. H:ilst"n. chairman of the
committee on arrangements, and Secre
tary E. 11. Benjamin are actively looking
after the details of the long programme

i other boards of trade and other civic,
official and commercial bodies through
the State will join in the welcome.
It should not be forgotten that all this
I waking up ut homo and this getting and
keeping the. revived mining interests be- i
I fore Californians generally are not the '
| least of the benefits that will reward this
display of enterprise and hospitality.
The industry is booming literally "from
] Siskiyou to San Diego"â from Del Norte j
!to the desert. This is easiest realized by i
! the mining life reflected in the local j
papers of every mining county. To one j
familiar with the country press the con
trast between the present and. not only
four or five years ago, but with a year
ago, is very noticeable. The country
, paper is, of course, always loyal to its
own and an exponent of present richness j
! of resources and of future greatness in j
its county. Not long ago there was be- ;
ing declared in all, in various forms, "We '
have the mineral resources and when
capital comes, as it will some day, we'll ,
be great," but "mining news" seemed j
scarce and the papers gossiped mainly '
about the small doings of sleepy comniu- !
nities. Now in all the mining regions
news of mines bought and bonded, shafts
sinking, mills erected, promoters' skir
mishes, ore and bullion shipments and of
general prosperity take up several times
the space such topics did two or three
years ago.
Del Norte County just woke up last
spring. It is up there on a rugged coast
and never saw the cars. With no rail
rou.il its miniim revival was delayed. It
came with the copper boom, and hunting
and digging for copper is starting a more
lively hunt for gold.
"The mineral resources of the county
are as yet an unknown quantity," says
the Del Norte Record. "From its earliest
settlement mining has been carried on
In a small way for gold, with good profit
In many instances. That it could be made
more profitable by systematic mining
cannot be disputed. Copper mining was
also followed in the early history of the
county, and thousands of dollars were
spent and hundreds of men employed in
the Low Divide country, about ten miles
from the seacoast, back of Smith River
Valley. The high freight rates prevail
ing, coupled with the long distance which
the orea had to be taken for treatment,
caused this Industry to Hose up to with
in the present year. Nc/vv there are many
prospectors in the mountains developing j
leads, and one or two mines are shipping
ore to San Francisco for smelting pur
poses. Present indications are that the
copper interests of the county will be
one of the most remunerative within a
short time."
The T'nlon copper mine up there is tak
ing live tons a day from a ledge several
feet wide and the last shipment to Selby's
by steamer yielded 19 per cent copper.
Other copper mines are developed about
to the shipping point and important cop- |
per enterprises are likely to attend a j
sustained copper demand. A number of
gold properties are being developed nnd
prospecting Is lively.
Along and across the Klamath and the
Trinity to the eastward in Slskiyou and
Trinity and then in Shasta is the liveli
est, biggest, least developed and probably
the most promising mining region of the
State. Prospectors swarm over the thou
sands of square miler, of that great,
broken, wooded and mineralized territory.
Through this big region there are hun
dreda of mines recently discovered and
developed to a promise of value and even
richness by men without capital, pegging
away with a drill and often paying ex
p< nsi a with a spring-pull mortar or an
ai raster, or by small shipments of ore
to smelters. Notes of these small strikes
and developments fill local papers con
stantly.
But capital is rapidly going into this
invitiTig field where prospects are not,
as a rule, held so high as in well-devel
oped districts. Many investments on the
scale of a few thousands have been made
this- year in quartz, copper, hydraulic and
dredging propositions and som^ will
reach into the hundreds of thousands.
The next two years promises to see the
development of some very big operations '
in the Shasta County copper belt, where
Captain de Uiraar. the millionaire oper
ator, recently bought and began to fur
ther develop the Bully Hill group of cop
per claims and where the Afterthought
and other copper properties are undergo
ing active exploration by Eastern capi
talists. So great and rich bodies of cop
per have been developed by the Mountain
Copper Company in Iron Mountain, and
so promising are the indications that as
great or greater ore bodies exist along
that twenty-five mile copper belt, that
the outlook is promising for the erection
of more great smelters and the growth of
a mining camp that will be a second
Butte City. California seems about to
leap to high rank among the copper pro
ducing States.
All sorts of river dredging propositions
are floating about "between wind and
water." When the '49ers and '55ers and
the rest of them got through with the
lower courses of the golden rivers and
went away, the recent and ancient
beds of the streams which could
not be reached or profitably worked by
flummg, damming, etc., still kept
their Â£?old and then through long years
the hydraulic and other miners in the
mountains sent down millions of cubic
yards of tailings carrying gold that
riched further these river beds. Now
when long experiment has developed big
machines that will reach down forty feet
and in favorable ground, work 2500 cubic
yards a day for 3 cents a cubic yard, and
when the financial success of modern gold
dredges has been recently demonstrated
in California, men are turning to those
long abandoned present river bottoms and
to the river benches that plank them.
The Klamath. Trinity, Feather, Yuba,
American, Stanislaus and Tuolumne riv
ers are now either worked or about to be
and dredges are apt to rapidly multiply.
The Feather, near Oroville, and the
Yuba. near Marysvllle, are the chief cen
ters of dredging now and several dredges
are In operation with more building and
planned. The Continental Dredging Com
pany is building at Oroville one larger
than any yet in use there. Orders for
two new ones have just been given a San
Francisco firm. George Evans will build
one this winter. Next month all the
dredges about Oroville will substitute
electric for steam power.
The operation of these dredges which
simply stack their tailings behind them
as they proceed has inspired the Marys
ville Democrat to sound a warning that
recalls the old anti-debris opposition to
the hydraulic miners. The Democrat
thinks the dredges will work damage by
shoaling further the streams.
This dredging industry seems to be
bringing an interesting legal question to
the front. Long stretches of the bed of
the Feather are being located as placer
claims right in this populous region,
where all land along the bank is privately
owned. Tt is asserted on one hand that
an owner's rights on the bank of a
stream go to the middle of the
stream. On the other hand ownership is j
asserted to stop at the meander lines as |
declared by Government surveys. If a
stream is "navigable." is its bed, as j
asserted by Attorney A. H. Ricketts in
The Call recently, the property of the
State? If so Federal location laws do not
apply.
Southern Californa affords plenty of
mining news these days chiefly concern-
Ing oil and gold. The Randsburg Miner i
says: "Randsburg has again assumed its
old-time actlveness and people are now '
rolling In by the bus loads. Mine deal
ers and mine owners are numerous and
full of business. Money Is plenty and
easy and every one seems to be satisfied
that they are in Randsburg."
San Diego County has another new dis
covery. In Bear Valley argentiferous ga
lena assaying 14 per cent lead, 19 ounces
in silver and $3 In gold has been found.
There is great interest in the discovery-
Santa Barbara County is credited by
report with a subterranean "lake of
liquid asphaltum." near Carpenterla. It
was struck in drilling an oil well at 1250
feet, is "like soft mush" and has risen
160 feet In the pipe. At last accounts the
operators couldn't either get the stuff out
or keep on boring.
A new wharf for oil wells has been run J
Into the ocean 500 feet at Summerland and
oil struck in the first well at 260 ifei.
The Heald coal mine at Garloch, near
Randsburg. is being developed, and it is
said the owners have contracted to ae
liver several thousand tons. -nxr-vicY
NEWS OF FOREIGN NAVIES.
The Niclausse water-tube boiler, which,
like the Belleville boiler, is a French in
vention, is installed in twenty-seven
war vessels of which sixteen are in the
French navy. Their collective horse
power is 302,100 and range in sets from
20,200 to 9000 horsepower.
The London Engineer of a recent date
has an editorial on battleships contend
ing in substance that a battleship may
have too great a speed. The opinion is
expressed that guns and armor are of
more value than speed. That in a swift
battleship the coal supply will run short
at a critical moment perhaps, and that
thus her superior speed may lead to the
ship's destruction in that way. As battle
ships go in squadrons, 15 knots of a
homogeneous company is better than
when composed of ships of varying
speeds, and 12 knots is really the highest
at which fleet evolutions have yet been
done.
The British battleship Ocean has passed
through a thirty-hour trial at sea
under three-fifth power. The boilers
carried a steam pressure, of 259 pounds,
giving 102 revolutions and developing
10,314 horsepower, which gave a speed of
16.2 knots. The coal consumption was
only 1.63 pounds against 2 to 2*4 pounds
in the Majestic class built six years ago.
Two formidable battleships are in
course of construction at Italian dock
yards, one named Reglna Margherita at
Ipezia, and another called Amivaglla
Benedetto Brin at Castellmara. They are
sister ships, 413 feet In length at water
line, 78 feet beam and displace 14,000 tons
on a draught of 27 feet. The horsepower
under natural draught is to be 14.000 and
18,000 under forced draught, calculated to
give a speed of 18 and 21 knots under
above respective conditions. The hull
armor consists of a 6-inch belt extending
from three feet below water to the main
deck and reaching to within 50 feet of the
stern. The bulkheads are 10 to 12 inches,
the iTun positions 6 inches and the pro
tection deck 3.2 to 1.5 Inches. The arma
ment consists of two 12-lnch guns, one
forward and another aft, placed in bar
bettes, ten 8-inch quick-firers placed In
pairs In five turrets, sixteen 12-poundera
and eight 3-pounders. The normal coal
supply is 1000 tons and the capacity is
2000 tons, calculated to give a steaming
radius of 5000 and 10,000 knots at the rate
of speed of 10 knots an hour.
The Coroner's jury in the case of the
accident to the British torpedo-boat
destroyer Bullfinch rendered a verdict on
August 17, after a session of nearly three
weeks. The disaster which resulted in the
scalding to death of nine men occurred
on July 21, and was caused by the break
ing of the piston rod of the port engine
high-pressure cylinder, the broken rod
smashing the cylinder head and thereby
filling the engine-room with scalding
steam. The jury came to the conclusion
! that the breakage was due to faulty
j design and an absence of uniform good
! quality of material. The most conclusive
evidence covering the first finding was
the testimony of an expert mechanical
engineer who stated that he had dis
covered a slight longitudinal flaw in one
! of the other piston rods very similar to
i and in the same place as in the broken
rod. The rods are made hollow, chiefly
to save weight, but the accident will
have a tendency to make the margin of
safety considerably greater, and the
Admiralty officials have already given as
surance to that effect.
An armored cruiser named Varese wa3
launched August 6 from the Orlando yard
at Leghorn. She is the third vessel of
that name recently built at that yard for
the Italian navy, the first two. however,
havinf been sold to Argentine. The
latest ship is an improvement upon those
previously built and is 36*5 feet in length,
59 feet lO'i beam and displaces 7492 tons
on a draught of 24 feet. The belt and gun
positions are of 6-inch Harveyized steel
and her battery is composed of one 10
--inch, two 8-inch, fourteen 6-Inch, ten 12
pounders and six 6-pounders. Her speed
under natural draught Is to be 19 knocs,
and the coal capacity is over 1000 tons.
The Spanish armored cruiser Cristobal
Colon, which led our ships a race of fifty
miles in the sea fight off Santiago on July
3 one year ago, was of the Verese type, a
class of shipr. which if properly handled
have proved to be the best yet produced

Dr. R. SchefTman. Fred C. Scheffman and
Judge R F. Reese. These gentlemen
come as the representatives of the Com

, pressed the keenest disappointment at
their failure to reach San Francisco
ahead of the transport ShÂ»-ridan.
"We came by the shortest route in
order to get here in time to welcome the '
boys when they arrived,'" said Judge
Reese yesterday, "and as we did not ex- I
pect they would reach here before the '
11th we thought we would be here in
ample time. However, we are here and
we propose to make their stay in' San i
Francisco as pleasant as possible and '
then take them home with us.
"The reception committee decided that
it needed J40.000 to bring the boys back
home in style and give them a fitting re- ;
ception. That amount was raised in ten i
days by the simple method of selling
badges through the State at $1 each "
Governor LJnd and staff will arrive in
the morning by way of Portland and the
entire party of Minnesotans will remain
in San Francisco until the regiment is
mustered out. The volunteers will be
taken back East in Pullman sleepers over
the Great Northern and Northern Pa
cific from Portland, going from Sar Fran- !
Cisco to that point over the tracks of the
Southern Pacific.
Lieutenant Governor John T. Kean of
South Dakota, accompanied by Railroad
Commissioner Lafollette, visited the

band was called out in their honor and
they were given a serenade at the head-

SPIRITUALISM AND
OCCULTISM DISCUSSED
Dr. Allen Griffiths delivered an interest
ing lecture on "Spiritualism and Occult
ism" last night, at the meeting of the
Universal Brotherhood, in the hall of the
Academy of Sciences. A large audience
listened to his views on the subject. He
said in part:
Theosophy looks upon spiritualism
as it does upon everything else, from
the vantage ground of a universal
sweep of vision. It admits the fact of
genuine phenomena, the existence of
beings residing upon the superphysical
side of nature, and the possibility- of
communication being had with them
by men under certain conditions, but at
the same time warns against such
practices as productive of evil. It as
serts that man is composite in his
constitution, being composed broadly
speaking, of body, soul and spirit.
During life he exists in a physical
body and is usually dominated by de
sires and interests which at death per
ish because of their perishable na
ture; that during life his spiritual na
ture constantly strives to impress it
pelf upon the lower man and succeeds
in the ratio of his elevating thought
and action above merely earthly
affairs.
Thia is the voice of conscience. At
death, soul and spirit are separated
from the physical body which disin
tegrates and resolves back into Its
primal elements. The Karmic body,
an etherial counterpart of the physical
body, continues for a certain time
after death to exist upon the super
physicai plane: the astral is just
one remove from its former resi
dence in the physical body on earth.
This Karmic body is the residence of
the soul, composed of animal and
human qualities.
Immediately after death, with rare
exceptions, the spiritual entity, the
real man, ascends to the spiritual
realm The Karmic body, holding only
the lower animal, earthly and perish
able part of the former man. persists
for a time in the astral world, and it
is with this that ordinary mediums
communicate, not with the true spir
itual entity, as that has already risen
beyond reach of mediumistic inter
course.
The intelligence that animates the
Karmic body is but a reflection of the
real man and persists for a short time
only by virtue of previously imparted
momentum, which is soon exhausted
because severed from its source. This
reflected, low and waning intelligence
has no volition of its own, but when
galvanized into artificial life by a
medium from whom It absorbs
strength, may impart some portion of
its disappearing contents, but it does
not and cannot impart more.
REV. DR. LOCKE'S
FAREWELL ADDRESS
Rev. Dr. Locke preached his farewell
sermon to a large congregation last night.
Scores of those who wished to hear him
were turned away, unable to get within
the outer doors. The pastor spoke elo
quently, his voice at times breaking with
feeling. His B- rmon, in brief, was as fol
lows:
We live In deeds, not in years; In
thoughts, not breaths. We should
count time by heart throbs. He most
lives who thinks most, feels the
noblest, acts the best. I am not In
clined this evening so much to preach
to you as I am to emphasize some liv
ing" words. I give you the text which
I have just read as a motto for good
living.
The heart stands for man's moral
and spiritual nature. The real- issues
of life depend upon heart power and
heart achievement While we often
say the mind is the man. yet that
man is of pigmy nature whose mind
has not been d at the expense
of his heart. Be true to your friends.
Longfellow says h> breathed a song
into the air. and then writes:
The ?"ng from beginning to en.l
I found aealn in the hpart at a friend.
In closing Dr. Locke spoke tenderly nf
his affection for his people, and of a hop?
that .it some futur- time he might be
returned to labor in San Francisco.
Initial Sermon by Father McCourt.
Father J. >* McCourt, who has just ar
rived at Old St. Mary's Church in this
city, delivered his first sermon last night.
Father McCourt. who has been connect
ed with the Paulist Novitiate at Wash
ington for the past four years, comes to
this city with a reputation as an able
speaker, which he fully sustained in his
Initial sermon last night. His subject
was the Virein Mary, and his large audi
ence followed every word with attention.
In part be Bald:
All Christians love and honor the
holy name of Mary, because she had
a special share in the work of our re
demption, and this work was to co
operate freely and intelligently in body
and soul: to accept an office of the
highest dignity indeed, but one that
Involves great responsibility and sor
row. This office was greater than any
given to either man or angel.
She was associated in his work. She
stopped him at the age of 12 when he
said he must be about his Father's
work. She caused him to resume it at
the marriage feast in Cana, at GaH
lee, where he worked his first miracle
at her prayer. She was associated in
his passion. Simeon bound son and
mother in a common bond of suffering
and she followed him along the dolo
rous road that led to Calvary, and
etood beneath the cross. Why was
Mary there? What mother ever goes
to the execution of her son? Here
was some design of God. some mystery
of his love to be carried out.
Our Lord had been conceived and
born without detriment to her virgin
ity, without pain or labor. God lays
upon her the full law of maternity ,
that "in labor and sorrow she shall
bring forth children."
Unbinding of Lazarus.
Rev. E. Nelander of the First English
Lutheran Church preached to his con
gregation last night on "The Unbinding
of Lazarus." In part he said:
God never does directly what he can
do through others. Ht^ might have
furnished Noah with a complete ocean
steamer, but he did not. He let the
patriarch hammer away at the ark
through a century, but he did furnish
him with the length, the breadth and
the height, because there was no skill
In him to discover these.
"Roll ye away the stone," said Jesus
to his disciples; not because he could
not himself have done it. but he would
enlist their Bervice. "Loose him and
let him go." he said. He could him
self have unwound the bandages, but
that is not his way of doing things.
He is saving the world through ua.
His word to every one of his follow
ers is: "Lend a hand. Loose them
and let them go." The great eman
cipator speaks. Unbind the cerements!
This Is practical "Altruism."
DR. STEBBINS IS
HONORED BY HIS
CONGREGATION
Thirty-Fifth Year of
His Pastorate.
RECEIVES A FINE TESTIMONIAL
IT IS ACCOMPANIED BY A VERY
HANDSOME CHECK.
The Popular Divine Preaches the An
niversary Sermon, and Both
He and His Flock Are
Visibly Affected.
The Rev. Horatio Stebbins, D.D., cele
brated the thirty-fifth anniversary of his
pastorate of the First Unitarian Church
yesterday morning in the church edifice
on the corner of Geary and Franklin
streets. Dr. Stebbins presiued at the ser
vices and preached the anniversary ser
mon. This was the second time that he
had occupied the pulpit since his recent
illness, from which he has happily recov
ered. '
A feature of the occasion was the pre
sentation to Dr. Stebbins of a beautifully
engrossed testimonial, accompanied by a
check for $2000. The testimonial was
signed by over 300 members of the con
gregation, to which the distinguished prel
ate has endeared himself throughout the
many years of his ministration. Many of
the assemblage were visibly affected
when the recipient responded in a feel
ing manner. He also found it difficult to
control his own feelings, and there were
few dry eyes in the congregation.
The Rev. A. J. VVelis assisted at the
services, and in his prayer gave thanks
that the pastor of the First Church had
been spared to continue his influence
among the members of his flock.
In his sermon Dr. Stebbins referred to
the wondrous changes thai have occurred
during the past fifty years, and which
included some of the greatest achieve
ments of man on the earth.
"Few of you," he said, "remember the
origin of the First Unitarian Church,
nearly half a century ago. Forty-seven
years ago your committee requested me
to become your pastor. Of that commit
tee only one is prt-^ent. John Perry Jr.,
whose heart is as young as his years are
venerable. I did not accept the call
then, but twelve years later, when hearts
were weeping at the death of one whose
name will ever be revered, I became your
pastor to succeed him.
"I myseif would not clothe this day,
with so much importance, for it is as the
flash of candle light amid the splendors
of the sun. Suffice it to say, however,
that in the kindliness of your spirit you
would deign to honor it as you see fit.
This church has stood for the great prin
ciples of freedom and independence. It
shall ever be the guardian of Protestant
ism and republican liberty. Its prosper
ity has been steady going. Its pastor has
neverâ and I ask pardon for itâendeavor
ed to get up a sensation. Its friendships
have been lasting, and the" association of
itn members has b^en an influence for
good. Religion is the great sentiment of
human nature, and puts in action thfe
richest sources of human experiences."
Dr. Stebbins referred to the influence of
the good men who had passed to the
great beyond, and concluded by blessing
his congregation.
Moderator Frank J. Symmes then ad
dressed Dr. Stebbins. saying that those
under his charge had thought it proper
to present him with a testimonial of the
high regard they entertained for him and
as a slight expression of their love and
affection. The testimonial was then read
by Mrs. Isidore Burns, and. after Dr.
Stebbins had responded, he received the
congratulations of many of the congre
gation.
Jonah, the Prophet, Discussed.
Rev. William Rader discoursed on
"The Gospel of Jonah" before the congre
gation of the Third Congregational
Church last night, i.c explained who
Jonah was, dwelt on his disobedience and
told of his visit to Nineveh and the work
he accomplished there as an Evangelist.
In discussing the prophet the speaker
said, in part:
"We learn how foolish is diso
bedience. God crosses our path with
storms, our ships creak and strain in
the stress of contrary winds. Jonah
was not a good prophet, or, if he was,
he was not a high type of a man. He
was not great as was Elijah or Isaiah
or Moses. It was his duty to go to
Nineveh, as clearly as it was Dewey's
to enter the harbor of Manila, or the
Americans intrenched on Bunker Hill
to pull their musket triggers when
they saw the eyes of fhe redcoats.
"We learn that the end $f law is not
punishment, but to make people bet
ter. Punishment Is never an end with
God. Contrast this purpose with that
of tfie Dreyfus iudges. who have suc
ceeded in making the impression that
they endeavored to find grounds for
puninshment instead of vindication;
that they tried to excuse their ven
geance rather than to establish jus
tice."
Officers' Night at the Orpheum.
This will be officers' night at the Or
pheum. and as the guests of the citizens'
executive committee, 160 of the Idaho,
Minnesota and Dakota commissioned offi
cers will attend the performance. The
shoulder-strap veterans have been pro
vided with boxes by the management.
DEDICATION OF A
NEW SEPHER TORAH
CEREMONIES AT THE NEVAH
ZEDECK SYNAGOGUE.
Dr. Isidor Myers Delivers an Ad
dress â Congregation Inscribes
the First and Last
Verses.
The dedication of a new Sepher Torah,
or Book of the Law, took place yesterday
afternoon at the Congregation Nevah Ze
deck, on Mission street. The Torah,
which Is in the form of a parchment
scroll, was recently written by B. Gold
man, a scribe, in Europe, and broug-ht to
this city, where it was raffled and do
nated by the winner to the congregation.
The ceremonies of the dedication consist
ed of an address by Dr. Isidor Myers of
the Bush-street synagogue and selections
by the Hebrew Orphan Asylum band.
The first and last verses of the sacred
scroll had been left unfinished by the orig
inal scribe, and It became the duty of the
members of the congregation to fill In the
required letters of the verses, and this
privilege was acquired yesterday after
noon by purchase. M. Rapkin acted as
auctioneer, and succeeded in collecting
quite a sum. which will go to the benefit
of the congregation. After the inscription
of the verses had been completed the
Torah was deposited In the ark in which
reposes several other sacred scrolls.
In his address Dr. Myers said: "It is
in accordance with an ancient Jewish cus
tom that we are assembled here to finish
the inscribing of the Torah. The Torah
was given to all Israel, and its crown 13
greater than that of the priesthood or
royalty. Every Israelite can take tho
crown of the Torah and put It on his own
brow. It Is a sacred heritage handed
down from generation to generation. It
Is your best friend, and has at all times
been the safeguard of Israel." Dr. My
ers referred to the sentence of Dreyfus,
which he characterized aa the greatest
tragedy of the age.
"The fate of one man." he said, "de
cides your fate and the fate of every Jew
in the universe. It is the case of an indi
vidual unjustly condemned through the
hatred of the pagan spirit that is still
rampant in the world. France is not the
only country where bigotry condemns the
unfortunate to suffering. There are other
places equally as intolerant."
Dr. Myers concluded by exhorting his
hearers "ever to remain steadfast to their
Torah. which was an antidote for all the
evil passions to which man is heir.
DR. COYLE ON FRANCE
OAKLAND, Sept. 10.â "France, in the
judgment of many, is trembling on the
verge of national collapse; and, from the
decision in the Dreyfus affair yesterday,
one is tempted to say that she deserves to
collapse."
The foregoing words were uttered to
day by Rev. Dr. Robert F. Coyle, pastor
of the First Presbyterian Church, in the
course of a sermon entitled "Waiting for
Christ."
Dr. Coyle has but recently returned
from a four months' tour through Eng
land, France and Europe generally, and
was briefly commenting in to-day s ser
mon on the present spasm of war that, he
said, seems to have seized almost every
nation. It was his first sermon since his
departure last May. and he was greeted
with an overwhelming attendance.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 11, 1899.
SENATORS WON A
VICTORY IN THE
ELEVENTH INNING
Locals Play in Hard Luck and Lose
Two Games to the Sacra
mento Aggregation.
Sacramento 3, San Francisco 2.
Eleven innings.
Uncle Henry Harris, manager of the
San Francisco*, is do longer a believer In
â igna. When his aggregation of players
defeated the Capital City representatives
Saturday last he grew happy In the belief
that the hoodoo hanging over his team
had vanished. This fond Illusion was
dispelled yesterday afternoon when the
Sacramentos left the Recreation grounds
with another victory In their keeping, and
now your Uncle Is around town hunting
lucky charms.
Both teams struggled for eleven Innings
tor supremacy, During that period five
1 thousand enthusiasts howled and stamped [
for their favorite team. Victory hung in
the balance after the ninth inning. In the.
eleventh the weight of one run settled the
game.
The meeting of the leaders in the race
for the pennant was expected to prove ox
citing but the "fans" had not counted on
the contest going more than nine innings.
AS Inning followed Inning the excitement
grew intense and when Sacramento scored
the winning run the noise was Incessant.
it would have been greater In volume had
the home team won, as they had a larger
following In the grounds.
The game started off auspiciously for
Pan Francisco. HrockhotT and Hildcr
brandt, the tlrst men up, scored In quick
succession, but try as It would the local
team could not land another tally. Sac
ramento gained one in the third, tied th^
score in the seventh and then there was
a battle royal.
In the eighth Sacramento would have
added a tally but for n brilliant catch
made by Dr. Pyno. There were two men
out and Dennis was on the third cushion. â 
"Truck" Bagan, one of the heaviest but
ter.s in the team, was up and after wait-
Ing for one of Iberg's shoots, lifted the
sphere over second. Pyne saw It coming
and putting on a spurt got under the ball
and the' Frisco followers breathed easier.
In the ninth Sacramento made three
hits and had three men on bases, but good
. fielding prolonged the agony. Neither
team did anything in the tenth.
When Frisco went to the bat in the
i eleventh Swindells led oft with a single
i past third, Rlley made a Herculean effort
, to lose the ball, but struck out: Pyne flew ;
' out and Iberg, as usual, followed Rlley's
example. Stanley reached first for ; Sac
ramento because Sullivan dropped a dif
ficult ball thrown by Rroeknoff. Doyle
forced him at second a moment later, ,
Bbanahan singled to center and Stultz â¢
flew to Krug. With two out and two men
on bases; hard-hitting Sheehan drove one '
to right and Doyle beat the ball home,
ending the game.
Sacramento had no trouble locating
[berg's curves. They lined out ten hits
and as many more that were landed by
the excellent fielding- of the local nine.
Sullivan's work at first was of high order
Bheehan distinguished himself at third
as did also Rlley. Following is the score:

MORNING GAME.
Sacramento 10. San Francisco 4.
"Fireman" Fitz's spirit was subdued by
the Senators yesterday morning at Oak
land. His shoots, which have so long
! puzzled the Capital City team, were
: solved before the game was half over,
, and the way they hammered the sphere
around the lot gave Fitipatrick a tired
feeling and caused Uncle Henry to put
crape on his hat. Eighteen swats were
made in half that number of innings by
the visitors, and the local team had a
merry time chasing three-baggers, two
i baggers and singles, many of which were
i converted into tallies.
The San Francisco?" husky t wirier was
decidedly not in it at any stage of the
game. Ho lacked his usual speed, was
erratic, and had no control of the ball.
In his effort to put the sphere over the
plate he slackened up in his work, and
jas a result was touched up hard and
t often. It was rather a sad performance
on his part, made doubly so by reason of
the fact that the men behind him backed
him in fine Style. . ...
The local aggregation were in - nigh
fettle In the early part of the game, as
they had a slight lead, but when the
fourth inning arrived, with its six tallies
for the Senators their hopes dwindled
perceptibly. Shanahan led off in that in
ning with a home-run crack over the lett
field fence. Stultz was Riven a base on
balls, but was forced out at second by
Sheehan's bunt. Dennle followed with a
scratch hit, and Mclaughlin made the two
out. It wan then that auburn-haired
Harvey swung his bat and landed the ball
far out in the center garden for a triple,
scoring his team mates and creating all
kinds of enthusiasm. "Fit*" became even
more demoralized, "and pitched balls that
waltzed up to the plate as big as life. I
There were cries for Xberg, but he was not j
! Bent to the rescue. â  Sacramento con
i tinued the good work until six runs
I were recorded, when Uncle .Henry
shifted the other foot and the side I
was retired. Try as they would, the |
San Franciscos could only decrease
the lead with a lone tally, gained in the
sixth by Krug. He readied ilrst on a
slow bunt, took third on Sullivan's two
| bag-ger and scored on Courtney's sacri- j
fice.
Credit is due Swindells for his heroic
work behind the bat. Twice he received
"fingers" that brought blood, but he
stayed with the trouble. Harvey deserves
j the credit of the victory, a? he pitched a
splendid game. Stanley came to the bat
five times, had two strikes on four differ
ent times, and in each instance rapped out
a hit. Following is the score:

PEDLAR PALMER TO FIGHT
M'GOVERN IN NEW YORK
English Champion Is to Go Against
a Man Who Has an Excellent
Ring Record.
NEW YORK, Sept 10.â Terry McGovern
: of Brooklyn and Pedlar Palmer of Eng
land are to meet to-morrow for a 00,000
purse in a twenty-live round bout at 116
pounds before the Westcheater Athletic
Cub. and the fight has attracted unusual
Inter* si
McGovern and Palmer, the Bportamen
Bay, are two very evenly matched fight
ers, and as each has trained hard there
should be a battle from start to finish.
BÂ«uh are clever, game and clean cut.
They have scores of victories to their
credit, are pugilists of the widest popu
larity in their respective countries and
consequently the interest will be at the
fever point.
A number of Englishmen have come
i from the other Bide to back Palmer In
the right and Korea of them already in
America will Journey from distant points
tot Uie same purpose. The preponder
ance of money here i? naturally in the
i hands of the Americans and almost t" a
: man they have picked McGovern to win.
Consequently he is a favorite in the bet
ting.
The only time the Americans ever saw
Palmer In the rinir was on January 30.
ISM when he fought George Dixon a six
-1 round draw in Madison Square Garden.
| Then he made a most favorable impres
â  si>Â»n. On the other side he has whipped
i such men as Billy Plimmer. Billy Rotch
ford. Erne Stanton. Dave Sullivan. Dave
i Wallace and Billy Murphy.
Whenever Terry McGovern steps into
j the ring it is a case of fight from the be
ginning of the first round until a decision
is reached. He Is aggressive, a hard hit
ter and a good taker of punishment.
i Among those he has defeated are: John
! nie Richie. Sammy Kelly. Billy Barry,
Caspar Leon. Patsy Haley. Joe Ben
and Oeorgc Hun

Save for a few small coasting vessels
i the only arrivals of yesterday were
; the Pacific Mail Steamship Company's
steamer city of Rio de Janeiro, Captain
: Ward, from the Orient, and the Alaska
Transportation Company's steamer Ho
i mer, Captain Higgins, from St. Michael,
Cape Nome and Dutch Harbor.
The Rio came in very light as to pas
i sengers, bringing only twenty-one in the
cabin and about three times that num-
I ber in the steerage. She left Hongkong on
! August 12 ' and Yokohama on the 23d,
touching at Honolulu on her way across.
Her officers report a pleasant, uneventful
\ trip, with good weather.
The Homer arrived with about 150 pas
sengers from Cape Nome, St. Michael and
I Unalaska. Most of them were employes
I of the transportation company who were
returning to the city after having finished
their summer's work at the company s
different stations. Few of them were
miners or prospectors, and those few
brought down but little treasure to speak
! Of. .
Among the passengers was Captain M.
A. Healy, formerly in command of the
revenue cutter Bear, who has been spend
, ing the last few months at the different
I mining camps of Cape Nome and the ru
j kon as the guest of H. Liebea & Co. Cap
tain Healy speaks very favorably of the
prospects at both the old diggings in the
vicinity of Dawson and the newer ones at
Cape Nome. Â â . ,
"I am not a mining man myself, said
' the captain, "but, to judge from the way
the prospectors are Hocking to Nome ana
'â¢ the enthusiasm that is evinced by those
I Who do know what good mining property
I is, I should predict that the new camps
'â  will turn out remarkably well. By that I
! mean that they should prove fully as rich
! as those of Dawson and Forty-mile, it
: they do not surpass them. ' .
"The mines up the Yukon are also doing
well and fully holding up the reputation
they have acquired for richness. The best
i proof of this Is the way in which capital
is steadily flowing into the country. The
i American Transportation and Trading
Company the Alaska Transportation
Company, the Alaska Commercial Com
pany, the North American Transportation
and Trading Companyâ in fact, all the big
concerns and a number of smaller ones,
are bringing in great loads of merchandise
; and building as fast as they can get new
i structures up. This is the best possible
I evidence of the prosperity of a place. If
there Is no money in a country the big
mercantile concerns soon let it alone.
"One thing which is a source of great
, annoyance on the Yukon is the legal en
! tanglement in which nearly every one is
mixed up. I mean the litigation arising
1 from clouded titles to mining claims and
! real estate. Almost every person who is
at all interested in any sort of property
i has his right to it disputed by anywhere
i from one to half a dozen others, and the
! result is a great deal of trouble and end
: less legal confusion. However, in time
this will be all straightened out.
"On our way down we met the revenue
! cutter Corwin. which is now on her way
I up the Koskoquin River to investigate th?
reported murder of some miners by the
Indians in that part of the country. I
i did not learn the names of the men.
The physicians at the Harbor Hospital
had an easy time of It yesterday. Only
one case was reported, and that was the
' case of Joe Egan. an employe at Jv. w.
Montague & Co.'s, 309 Market street. He
put his hand in a stamp and then pressed
the lever to see what it would do. The
' machine crushed the index finger of his
i right hand so badly that an amputation at
the second joint was necessary.

ALMOST CAUSED
AN ATTACK OF
HEART FAILURE
Carnegie's Gift Was
So Sudden.
OAKLAND FEELS STRANGE
B. FAY MILLS MAY AGAIN SEE
HIS TABERNACLE.
.. Fa:es a Dilemma From
Which ft Can Be Extricated Only
by Rare Diplomacy â Rocks
.â¢? Offing.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
903 Broadway, Sept. 10.
The little letter from the obscure Scot
tish castle containing- about 100 words
and promising; a generous sum to Oak
land fjr a free library has taken the city
surprise. This Is quite excusable. It is
a strange experience for Oaklanders to
receive anything- from wealthy men.
E.r.ce Its birth In 1>52, when Horace Car
pentler and his associates laid the
foundation for drawing from the city of
the future its last drop of llfeblood. Oak
land has received few gifts. The late
Anthony Chabct gave the city and ob
eevratory as an adjunct to Its edu
cational department. The late Dr. Mer
rttt presented a clock to til City Hall;
Dr. Pardee has given a valuable lens to
the observatory- Most of those who are
Indebted to the city for all they lay claim
to have considered that their duty was
performed If they gave the city a black
eye. Consequently, when a little note
wa.3 received from Andrew Carnegie, ho
probably never was in Oakland in his
life and never was seen by more than one
Oaklander. it Is not surprising that the
city should feel as if something unusual,
almost uncanny, had happened. Up to
cats no one seems to have mistrusted the
sincerity of the Lord of Homestead,
which would not have been the case had
Mr. Carr.egie been a sraduate of the
Oakland political school. His example
should be productive of similar efforts.
Mr. Carnegie, so far as known, never
made a dollar out of Oakland. There are
men timing- to be millionaires parading
her stieets. who while they may never
have "made" a dollar out ot Oakland by
the sweat of their brains or their brows,
have in some manner or other, derived
vast fortunes from her and her people.
To these men is referred the Iâ : of Mr.
Carr.egie. with the suggestion that It be
taken under advisement.
At Twelfth and Webster streets is a
large tabernacle. Many years ago It was
erected in response to a request that a
fitting building- be prepared to receive
Rev. B. Fay Mills, an evangelist credited
with a record of starting thousands of
halting and undecided young Christians
in the straight and narrow path. The
building was filled each morning, after
noon and far into the night with a crowd
numbering from 3000 to 3000. Several
times during the stay of the evangelist
all '.he local churches were close'i so
that every member of their congregations
might derive tne fullest possible benefit
from the words of Mr. Mills. Daily this
evangelist gathered round him the
honored and practical men who filled
the p.-istorates of the local churches. In j
a marji'r aira-ost dictatorial Rev. B. Fay j
Mills wouM Impart to the pastors his 1
ideas or. conducting a revival: There i
must fcÂ» a certain amount of mechanical !
work done, doors must be opened and
closed only at a certain time; ushers must
perform their duties in just such a man
ner; in no event must anything be done
to disturb thÂ» utterance of B. Fay Mills
during a meeting. Mr. Mills also declared
it necessary for the success of his
evangelicai revivals, that he must, with
his musical leader, absolutely control the
singing-. In short. Mr. Mills caused it to
be bruited abroad that he had studied the
practice ax-d science of expeditious!}- and
thoroughly exploiting the pure gospel of
the Saviour, of the atonement and of
salvation through the biood spilled on
Calvary, and that any interference with
3:is plans would be fatal to the best
results.
R*\: B. Fay Mills also succeeded In
doing what no other man has ever done
ir. Ookiand; he inaugurated a "mid-week
eabbath," and every merchant who did
r.ot close his doors for a large portion of
this special day, was almost adjudged to
he a heretic cr worse. The experiment
-.vas declared to be a great success, and so
It was from the standpoint of Rev. B.
Fay Mills. When the evangelist closed
his labors in Oakland, he laid the founda
tion of a system of visitation and In
spection that should be developed after
his departure so that the fruits of his
labors might not decay. For years after
The great Mills' revival was the great
toptc'of discussion in religious circles.
Now an effort is being made to bring
again Rev. B. Fay Mills to Oakland. Some
time ago Mr. Mills became convinced
that the great fundamental principles of
the trine with which he enthused Oak
land and many other cities years ago Is
all wrong. After much deliberate thought
he pronounced to the world that the real
religion of humanity and of reason Is
that of thp Unitarian church. In the
ardor of his new faith he became a min
ister of Unitarianism. To-day the prom
inent Unitarian Church of Oakland ac
cepted the resignation of Its paston and
several members expressed the desire
that Rev. B. Fay Mills could be induced
to me to the church for a few months
1". order that his intellectual force might
infuse new life and ambition Into the
congregation. Should Mr. Mills ever come
to Oakland on such a mission I would
like to be able. In the clearest of lan
guage, to express the thought that must
run through his mind as he gazed upon
thf old tabernacle, thought of the mid
week Sabbath, of his many eloquent dis
courses to the youth and aged of the bay
cities and of the effect his presence on
this his second mission must have on
the minds of tboee Influenced by him
under such ostentatious conditions yean
ago. It would be a rare study in theology,
tuch as seldom comes within -reach of a
suudent. Doubtless many of Mr. Mills'
tormer converts arc now praying that
the wool may be pulled from bis ..-yes and
that Satan may not be permit fd to blind
him for more ihitn "a UttlÂ« swtson." The
tabernacle, if Mr. Mais" relipious views
l>e new correct. la simply a monument to
hla pa.it errors.
It la very evident that there Is no rule
by which the value of property either
real or personal can be determined In this
â¢ ounty. During the past month it has
teen recorded that a mortgage :- ; no cri
ttrion of worth, a deed Is often merely
a ruse, appraisement is generally biased,
assessment is a whim, and even the sell
ing price is often subjected to such Jug
glery that a man of experience will pay j
no attention to it. It la even on record!
that a merchant's oath regarding the i
valut of his personal property may often j
be i: exct-ss of what it 13 worth, and j
therefore the amount of taxes any one
shall ; ay depends entirely on bis ability \
to sck -me. Such la the natural deduc- i
tion fr m the sworn testimony given rÂ«-- j
gardlr.g the assessment rolls of Alameda
t'ounty. The man who can obliterate such
a chaoti situation with a reasonable and
just syst -m is the man most needed.
Probabir there is no other city on earth
wher'! a man could assert that he had
been offer d a large turn of money to at
tempt to swindle the United States Gov- j
ernmert, ;^d where such an Incident I
would anerOy give rise to a smile. The
Eerlousrcss >f the situation does not ap
pear to nave appealed to anybody. Poli- .
ticiar.3 ircil'd. merchants took it a3 a :
matter loC course and the vast mass of
the peop.e who do not understand public
aSaira p.tsseÂ«l it by as something with i
which th-$' had no concern. At Wash- j
Ing-ton this little Incident seems to have
had great 'â weight. Wily Uncle Sam has !
not lived rr.'ore than a hundred and twenty i
years without acquiring much wisdom, ,
and it is site to say that when he se-J
Â»cv.i. a spec m uaKutid upon waicn to
erect a postoflice he will not pay very
much more for It than it Is worth. But
tne "worth" will depend of course upon
the opinion of these who are charged with
trie duty of advising the Government,
x.eoent developments in assessing 1 and
valuinsr property show that the differ
ence of opinions equally honest is as six
teen to one. ' *
How to raise more revenue tor the city
treasury than will be produced by source*
of income at present established Is the
grave question the City Council is now
facing. Much is expected of this Council.
Its platform is very progressive and the
character of its members is such- as to
preclude the idea that they are merely
an aggregation of seliiah politicians, with
no idea of carrying out their pledges.
They have already decided to carry out
one pledge by limiting the tax levy to a
dollar. This fidelity to their promise.
however, places them face to face with
another dilemma. With the present low
assessment the dollar limit will not give
them enough money to run the city along
the progressive lines to which they are
pledged. The only means by which money
can be raised is by placing a license tax
upon privileges or material at present
free. Any tax. of this nature must of
necessity be special In Its character and,
therefore, open to argument and opposi
tion. It will require all the diplomacy of
which this Council is capable to avoid the
apparently inevitable deficit. Tenants
will object to a tax on their business;
cyclists will object to a tax on their
wheels; others Will object to a tax on
their vehicles; and so on. wherever an ef
fort may be made to raise income.
Within the past three years tax-is have
been levied on outside firms doing busi
ness in this city, with the result that all
those taxed have avoided its payment by
opening a branch house in Oakland and
ostensibly doing business as local mer
chants. This Is nothing but an evasion in
many instances, but it is a legal evasion.
The adjustment of the inter-city trading
la a delicate matter, as it is directly- op
posed to the principle of free commerce
which is guaranteed between States by
the interstate commerce law. Oakland
merchants have frequently complained
bitterly that their travelers can do un
limited business without being taxed in
any State of the Union except California,
but that if they send a drummer to any
city in this State he is at once required
to do business at a great disadvantage,
while drummers from other States can
traverse the whole of California free of
all licenses. This is one view of the sit
uation. Cyclists will be told that if they
pay a small tax It will go into the street
fund and guarantee better streets, but
they will not be satisfied unless assured
that the owners of all other vehicles will
pay in proportion. There are many other
views of the matter demanding careful
consideration and no matter in what man
ner the solution is arrived at. it will meet
with a certain amount of unpopularity.
The meeting last Tuesday evening at
the City Hafl was a revelation. Some
thing went to pieces. Somebody's ship
was wrecked, while the lobby wondered.
A few weeks ago a little whispering was
being done as to whether the support of a
certain political element should go to Mr.
Mott or Mr. Rowe. tor some reason not
yet developed, the temporary favor of this
element was accorded Mr. Rowe. On
Tuesday evening Mr. Rowe was excited.
at times evidently forgetting that he was
in the president's chair, for otherwise he
would certainly have refrained from tak
ing part in a debate without leaving the
rostrum. Mr. M â â  caught the fiery spirit
that was in the air and caused It to be
know- that he resented criticism and was
capable of act.: independently at any
leading strings or programme- Mr.
Meese, the most conservative man and
jne of the most practical in the Council.
for the r.rst time showed that something
had tired him and he proposed to shake
t off. Had the fiery Cuvelller been pres
â¢nt. It is probable that the meeting would
have suggested the Fourth of July that
succeeded the destruction of Cervera's
3*et. The least observant could see that
"something was doing." and for the next
vw weeks affairs at the City Hall will be
patched more keenly and analytically
han they have been since the old admin
istration "walked out. It would be idle to
rues-: at the origin of the new order of
>j D Â« It will have to unfold Itself.

THE GAS BOTJTE.
Fact of Prior Convictions and Weight
oÂ£ Evidence in the Kirkham
Burglary Were Too Much
for Him.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
9Â°B Broadway. Sept. 10.
Albert Miller, who was arrested last
Wednesday on a charge of burglarizing
the Kirkham residence at Oak and
Eighth streets, made three determined ef
forts to commit suicide in his cell at the
City Prison this afternoon.
Shortly before 5 o'clock- one of the
trusties noted an unusually strong odor
of gas, and on investigating the various
cells and iron tanks finally discovered
Miller with the gas Jet in his mouth. The
Jet in Miller's cell is exceptionally low,
! and it was an easy matter for the pris
j oner to utilize the same with suicidal
I intent.
When found he was unconscious, and it
: was feared that he was beyond all hope.
Dr. H. M. Rucker, however, was prompt
ly summoned, and after working over the
would-be suicide fully an hour revived
him. It was discovered that Miller had
; previously attempted suicide by hang
! ing. He had torn his blanket into strips
i to make a rope, but it was not strong
i enough to stand the required strain.
Early this evening Miller made a third
attempt to end his life by the gas route,
but the trusty who had forestalled his
I previous effort had kept a closer watch
on him, and the gas in the cell was txien
completely turned off.
Miller has twice served time for bur
glary, although he Is but 22 years of
; age. Some years ago he served two years
at San Quentin, and at another time three
â  years, being released on August 13 last.
The fact of the prior convictions,
' coupled with the strong evidence against
him in the Kirkham burglary, together
with the prospect of serving a life sen
: tence, is supposed to have weighed so
heavily on the young ex-convict's mind
i that he concluded to put an end to his
i criminal career. He had told Officer

Nicholas Stafford, a Young Lithog
rapher, Booked on the Charge
of Grand Larceny.
Nicholas Stafford, a lithographer, IS
years of age, was arrested early-yesterday
morning by Policeman Beamer and book
ed at the City Prison on a charge of
grand larceny.
The complaining witness is William
Phillips, a saloonkeeper at Fifth and Na
toma streets. He was going home be
tween 3 and 4 o'clock and in passing Mis
sion street he pulled out his watch to
see the time. Four men were standing
on the corner and one of them made a
grab for Phillips ' watch, breaking the
chain and securing the watch.
Beamer happened to be near and Phil
lips notified him. Beamer placed the four
men under arrest and took them to thÂ£
Southern Station, accompanied by Phil
lips. There they were searched, but the
watch could not be found. As Phillips
identified Stafford as the one who grabbed
his watch he was booked on the charge
of grand larceny.

HUNT HAS BEEN
WEAK IN THE
HEAD FOR YEARS
Met With an Accident
at Yakima.
HIS BRAIN WAS INJURED
THREATENED TO KILL HIS OWN
BROTHER LAST FRIDAY.
Robert Hunt, who shot and killed
i George Elliott in a saloon at Steuart and
Howard streets, Saturday night, and
wounded E. R. Knippenberg, continues to
emphasize the impression that he is men
tally unbalanced. He appeared to be
more rational yesterday, but when he got
excited, began to talk in the same crazy
way. He can give no other reason (or
his deliberate murder of Elliott other
than that his victim had a "buck" tooth.
Hunt was visited yesterday afternoon
by his brother Clement They conversed
together for more than an hour. All the
time the murderer was quiet and talked
rationally.
Clement Hunt, after leaving his brother, |
said that Robert had been irresponsible ;
for his actions .for the past four years, \
but none of the family imagined that he
would commit murder.
"Four years ago," said Clement Hunt,
"my brother, while in the employment of
Simpson, at Yakima, on Puget Sound, !
met with the accident which made him j
crazy. He was ask-ep one night in the j
store when it collapsel and it was a won
der that he was not killed outright. A
knob of one of the doors struck him on
the head, penetrating his skull and affect-
Ing his brain. Since then he has been
mentally unbalanced.
"Friday night I was packing his trunk
when all of a sudden he went to the bu
reau drawer and to by surprise brought i
out a revolver. He pointed it at me and
said he was going to kill me. I felt that I
he would carry out his threat and had j
the presence of mind to talk to him quiet- i
ly. telling him 1 was not prepared to die. |
My first impulse- was to spring upon him i
and take the revolver from him. but the j
chances were against me and 1 temporized
with him. After a while he put the re
volver in his pocket and I breathed freely.
1 was in hopes he would put it back in
i the bureau drawer and I would have
seized it.
"My brother shows the effects of the
falling of the house at Yakima on his
Bkull, as the wound is plainly visible, j
j Prior to that he was a bright, young man. j
having obtained a first-class education. |
1 He was also a fine player on the piano." !
The preliminary examination of Hunt j
! has been assigned to Judge Mogan's ,
; court and will be called this morning and
continued pending the result of the Coro
; ner"s inquest. It is probable that the
! Judge will send Hunt to the Insanity !
t Vmrnissioners for examination as t'> his
.â ty.
i The condition of Ernest R. Knippinberg
at a late hour last night was easy, con
-1 sidering the nature of the wound. He
' had no fever and very little pain. Dr.
: Kearney has strong hopes for his re
j covery. No attempt has been made to
j locate" the bullet. It is thought that it
â¢ lodged against the spinal column. This,
in a measure, would account for tht 1
numbness which he felt in the left leg
at the time.

GAMBLERS STRIVE TO
BREAK DOWN PROTESTS
Seeking to Divide the Decent Citi=
zens of Colma.
Raiders Promise Positions After Incorporation to Those
Who Will Support Themâ To Make of the
Village a Gambling Hell.
THE gamblers have not by any
means abandoned their purpose
to secure possession of Colma
through incorporation. The de
termined opposition of the peo
ple of the little town, aroused by the
timely expose of The Call, has forced
the blacklegs t.Â» call a temporary halt,
but they are still working and have
struck upon a new scheme to accom
plish their dishonest purpose. They in
tend now. if possible, to break down the
opposition of the leaders by promising
of them the positions of Trustees
under the Incorporation of the town.
This is an old trick, and is not likely
to succeed in t; c pn sent instance. The
lers have absolutely no reason to
} the incorporation of Colma as a
town of the fifth class except to secure
ih- rit;ht to mak such laws as they
please and to control the officers and
revenues of the little town. It is a fact
known all over San Mateo County that
there are not enough legitimate, bona
lents of Colma to conduct
the affairs of the town after incorpora
tion. It would be necessary to import
rs, and the people of (""olma know
thoroughly what the character of these
officers would be.
They would be the most pliant tools
of the gamblers, and even if Colma citi
zens were given representation the
gamblers would take care that no
power went with the representation.
The touts of Buckley, i-iarrison and
their allies are also claiming that the
proposed coursing park represents an
independent scheme in no way asso-
I with the plea of town incorpora
CASEY EXPLAINS
HOW HE FOOLED
PLUNGER HOWARD
Jumped Off the Ala-
meda's Rail.
the Australian crook
who is confined in the City Prison, has
admitted to tin- police thai be did not
accompany Millionaire Green as far as
Honolulu, as was lirst reported, but
jumped off the Bteam< r Alameda on
which they had taken passage, ami swam
to Bhore unknown to his intended vic
tim. Casey, Kelly and Murphy, "pals" of
Howard, alias Doyle, alias "The Aus
tralian plunger," were paid $6000 by the
much-want< '! Bwindler to murder Green,
whom he had robbed of a fortune. See-
Ing an opportunity to get rid of his vic
tim, who, in ti,. language of Casey, was
"becoming troublesome," Howard

of the way.
After inducing Green to take passage i
on the Alameda fur the ostensible pur
lands in Aus
tralia which Howard claimed he owned,
the arch conspirator arranged with Casey.
Kelly anil Murphy to "knock him on the

and throw his body overboard.

and Howard, and after agreeing to carry
out the murderous scheme, was handed

intended crime. After Green was seen

i" a coffee .saloon on East street, where
the details of the plan to murder the
millionaire were, completed.
Kelly was paid the price he demanded
for silencing Green, and lie lost no time
in dividing the amount with his partner.
H' 'Ward stood on the wharf to see that
the men ('.id not leave the vessel, and as
it pull' d out in th<- stream he waved
a "fond' adieu to Green, who was on the
upper deck with c lasey.
When the vessel was some distance out
Casey, with his Bhare of the gold given
him by Howard, jumped overboard and
swam to shore. He was assisted in reach-
Ing the dock by a boatman, who saw him
gling in the water and went to the

ordered the driver to take him to his
room on Geary strei t near Larkln. As
the bouse h'- was met by his
landlady, who. noticing his condition,
proceeded to question him. Casey ex
plained to her that he had been out boat
ing witli two friends, and as the craft
was was compelled to swim to

In the meantime Green missed the

a long search concluded that he had ac

tlon. This is as untrue as are the other
assertions of the gamblers. The cour
sing park is simply a blind to cover
i the creation of a gambling town, free
for all games of chance, Eastern races, j
sure-thing games and general vicious- !
I ness. After incorporation the decent i
people of Colma will be utterly at the
mercy of the raiders.
The scheme of the gabblers to divide j
opposition will not succeed even if |
i some of the leaders do fall by the way- j
I side. The entire county is aroused, and \
j the Supervisors have indicated their j
purpose to represent honestly the best !
interests of the county. It is extremely \
â  likely that the touts will attempt to j
hold another meeting at all hazards, as !
their failure of Saturday night has dis- !
credited their cause and has shown j
conclusively that they do not possess !
; the support of the people of the town.
The case of the raiders is a desperate I
| one. They must be near San Francisco i
i in order to ply their trade with success. !
j They want the petty thieves, small \
j gamblers and cheap riffraff of the big j
i city, and transportation is an element i '
of gTave concern to these people, i ,
Driven out of San Francisco, on the â 
j verge of expulsion from Sausalito, j '
barred from Oakland, the manipulators : \
must go to San Mateo. That they will â 
strive for another meeting and attempt i '
also to make the Supervisors prove j \
false to their constituents there can be i ,
!no question, but the issue is now ai '
I plain one. It is a struggle between de- j \
i cency and indecency, and the Super- j .

jure him.
Thinking that Howard would realize
that he had been given the "double cross"
in case he showed himself, Casey travel
ed about the country for some t i m< . and
; finally returned to this city. He lost no
time in hunting up Howard, who was
anxiously waiting for some news from
the desperate trio. Casey told the j
"plunger" that he and his pals bad "si
lenced" Green while the Alameda was at
sea. He declared that they had enticed
him to the stern of the vessel and dur
ing an opportune moment struck him on
I the head and threw his body overboard.
Howard was BO elated with the "goud
news," as he expressed it, that he gave
Casey a bundle of greenbacks ami ad
vised him to get out of town. Casey, un
mindful of his advice, proceeded to g>-t
drunk, and was finally landed by the de- !
tectives.
yesterday Casey repeated to chief Lees
and Detective Gibson the Btory of how 1
he bad given Howard the "double cross."
He admitted thai he was aware tnat ;
Kelly was unuer arrest in New Mexico,
but was anxious to keep the fact away ;
from Lees and his men.
Both Casey and his attorney, George D. !
' Collins, confidently expect that Judge '
Murasky on next Tuesday will turn the
clever crook loose on the writ of habeas
corpus that has been sued out in his
behalf, in case he is released It Is the
intention of the police to rearrest him on
another charge the nature of which they
refuse to re \i al.
DR. M'QUEEN UPHOLDS
THE ADMINISTRATION
SAYS IT IS DOING ITS BEST IN
LUZON.
At Simpson Memorial Church last night
Rev. Dr. Peter Mac Queen of Boston, re
cently returned from an eight months'
visit to the Philippines, spoke upon his
; observations ;ir.<l experiences there. Dr.
Mac Queen went out as foreign editor of
the National Magazine of Boston.
Last night he said in part:
The war of the Tagala presents some of the
most thrilling ami unusual events of history.
When uur war with Spain began this beautl
lui archipelago was about as much known to
our people as are the canals ol Man. To-day
i they art- the cynosure of statesmen; and one "t
I the world questli I ihe greatest gyra
tions of history is also found in the attitude
! of, the American people upon the questions at
! Issue in the Spanish war. The war began with
'â  a public sentiment unanimous and unparalleled
jin its enthusiasm. Not one voles was heard
: against our righteous war with .Spain. To-day
it Is the sorrow of our country that high
minded men In all sections are greatly divided
and are forgetting themselves and calling one
another by the ungrateful titles of "tyrant"
and " 'traitor."
M' reover, when we started out we were we]
j corned by the people of l'orto Riro an.] Cuba
and the Philippines. To-day a Fallen folk in
the Jungles of Luzon and by the rivers of Pa
nay dispute us inch by inch, straining every
; nerve to be free from the governance of their
liberators. In spite of the fact that out of 75
or 100 fights they have not gained a point, they
ari- still defiant, dying across thf land with
their wives and children, burning their homes
and sanctuaries with their own hands. Killed
like sheep in the shambles, they stand at bay
In "a mood so defiant that the mightiest nation
I on earth cannot but dread the audacity of their
] despair. "
I hare been quoted in the papers of Xpw
, York and elsewhere as though I waa hostile
to the attitude of the President and the ad
ministration in their plans for the inlands
This Is not the case. I have no party affltll
atlons, and wish to study the w-Ã¼blem sim
ply as a patriot and a citizen.
The unfortunate Tagal war came on through
many causesâ chiefly, I think, ber-ause Âv r
laws do not admit of a foreign policy which
allows the President, In the case of an emer
gency, to act before Congress has acted on
a national policy. No doubt the long delay
at Manila made friction unavoidable. Of
course we have not yet heard the whole of the
Filipino case: but there exists scarce possible
room to doubt that our men endured great
provocation and insult with magnanimity and
patience. I associated a great deal with the
Russian. German and French correspondents
an<J attaches and found them agreeing on
this point, although they were rather against
our actions later on.
There Is evidence everywhere that the ad
ministration Is doing all In its power to set
things right In the Philippines. Even the
orders of General Otis recalling Lawton In
the middle of the Paranaque fightâ or rather I
bidding him to stop In the middle of the af
ternoonâwas a humane order, sent for the
purpose of letting the women and children
â¢ from the town. Incidentally and gal
lantly the men and soldiers accompanied th"m
and we found the city deserted save for a
few rats and dogs, which were not contra
band of war.
Notwithstanding much that can be said for
General Otis as a man honest and painstaking,
It Is still true that he Is thought to be Incom
petent to run the army anil also the civil Gov
ernment. The man is overworked and will
likely break down from the overstrain of at
tempting the Imnossible. Moreover, the fact
that the army wants a man with It on the
fighting zone, and that they have not the en
thusiasm for General Otis that they have for
men like Funston, Wheaton and Lawton, Is
good ground for the people to consider whether
they do not want a new general In Luzon. Law
ton Is the great military man of the Philip
pines, and Wheaton Is a noble fighter I al
ways went with those men. Whore they were
you were always sure to see bloodshed. The
army wants I^awton for commander. One man
has got to hare entire military control. Be
cause if you have three, they will cut one an
other up Instead of the Filipinos â one man will
start an expedition to-day, another next week
and so on. regardless of the movements of the
othor. A young man of great military and civil
ability was General Irving Hale of Colorado
He would have made a splendid Governor for
Manila. That city should be delivered from the
bondage of martial law. The native police are
better than ours in that they know the haunts
of crime, the languag* and the crooks of the
place.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 11, 1899.
PINKERTON OPERATIVES SAY
FRANK LANDIS WAS MURDERED
THE Pinkerton National Detective
Agency, through its operatives in
this city, has just concluded a
thorough Investigation into the
death of Frank Landis, the young
merchant who was found dead on the
morning of August P in his store at
Lincoln, Placer County, with a bullet
in iiis body. The verdict of the in
vestigators 1s that Landis was mur
dered, probably by burglars sur
prised in liis store before they had
had time to secure any plunder.
Conditions existing at the time of
the discovery of the body led Im
mediately to the theory of murder,
hut it was not long before the sus
picion was advanced that young
Landis had taken his own life, after
having made elaborate preparations
to mislead the community into the be
lief that he had met with foul play.
A 3S-caliber bullet, similar to those
fitting his revolver, was found in his
body. The weapon, with one chamber
discharged, and Landis' hat were
found near the corpse. Another bul
let, claimed at the time to have been
fired from the young merchant's
weapon, was found imbedded In a
partition separating the rear of the.
."Uore from a stairway opening onto
Sixth street. A lamp in the office was
overturned.
The theory of those who believed
th.- young man had committed sui
cide was that he had overturned the
lamp, after unlocking the front and
rear doors of the store, to lead to
the belief that there had been a
struggle, that he had then fired one
shot from his revolver into the par
tition and, after throwing away the
shell and putting in another car
tridge, had turned the weapon against
hinis.-!f. In further support of this
theory, the Sheriff produced an
empty shell, similar to those in
Landis' revolver, which had been
found among a pile of boxes in the
rear of the store.
Despite this theory and the facts
so deftly woven around it, there were
many who believed that Landis was
murdered. They pointed to the fact
that there appeared to be an entire
absence of motive for Buicide, while,
on the contrary, there was every
reason why Landis should value life.
His business was in a prosperous con
dition; he was engaged to marry a
charming young lady and he was in
the enjoyment of excellent prospects.
The Coroner's jury did not feel'com
petent to settle the matter, returning

road, residing at 24 West avenue. The ac
cident happened on Mission street, oppo
site Cortland avenue, about a block from
the carhouse. The unfortunate girl, who
was near-sighted and wore glasses, had
just stepped fron an outward-bound
Ingleslde car, and walked behind it to
cross the street to West avenue, when the
inward-bound car, well filled with passen
gers, came along. The girl crossed the
track, seemingly unmindful of the ap
proach of the car. She did not seem to
realize the danger, and walked almost di
rectly to the car, when it struck her and
knocked her down and rolled her about
100 feet before it could be stopped, there
being a heavy grade at that particular
place.
The body of the girl was carried into
Lyons' drug store, opposite, and Dr. W.
R. Bcroggs, who resides next door, was
summoned.
When the physician arrived the girl
was unconscious and in utter collapse.
He immediately applied restoratives and
tried to Induce artificial respiration, but
to no avail; the unfortunate girl died in
about an hour.
While the patient was being cared for
in the back room of the drug store a sad
scene was enacted in the front. The
father of the innocent victim was wait
ing impatiently the report from her bed
side, and when the news was told him
the unfortunate man broke down com
pletely. The blow comes doubly bard to
a verdict "that Lardis came to his
death from ;i gunsh it wound at the
hands of some part} unknown."
This verdict left the manner of
Landis' taking off an much "f an open
question as before. To sÂ«-t 1 1Â«> it once
for .'ill it was decided to employ the
Pinkerton agency. Money for this
purpose was raised and Superintend
ent Vanmitta of this t-ity sent seve
ral of his mi-n to the scene. The
result of Hair Investigation was given
in a report mailed yesterday to
Lincoln.
First of all they looked for some
motive that might have led I^andis 10
committ suicide. They found none.
()n the contrary, they found every
thing that would go to show the
young merchant's desire to live.
Then tiif detectives looked into
Landis' movements on the night of
August S. They found that he had
closed his store between 9 and 9:15
O'clock. The i;imi> usually left burn
ing was lighted when B. Logan, a
friend of Landla' called there at 9:30
o'clock and found the door locked.
At that time Landis was at Helge-
Bon's saloon and remained there until
10:20 o'clock, going to the Hotel
Hurdge, where he gave Town Mar
shal, E. W. Kedding, a letter to mail.
This letter, afterwards seen by tne
Pinkerton agents, was an ordinary
business epistle to Landis' father re
questing that f-ertain articles of mer
chandise be forwarded.
I^andlK remained at the Burdge
Hotel until 10:40 o'clock in conversa
tion with H. Hanna, when he left,
going toward hi.s store. He was in
ordinary spirits, and passing John-
Hon's printing office, jocularly asked
the men inside if they never quit
work.
That is the last seen of Landis alive
by any one known to the investi
gators. It was then after 10:40
o'clock. At 10:81 o'clock, however,
they have absolute proof that the
Lamp in Landis' store, which was
lighted while he was at Helge-
Bon's was not burning. Constable
William Hughes fixes the time posi
tively, his attention having been
called to the absence of light as ho
was passing. Ben Silas, a tamale
peddler, says there was no light in
the store at 10:27, when he passed,
and J. D. Green testifies to the samu
condition.
The theory of the Pinkerton op
eratives is that burglars, having noted
Landis' departure, got into the store
a. few minutes later and extinguished
the light, and were making ready to
him, as it is only a month since he
buried his wife. He has four other chil
dren.
The motorman of the car, Frederick F.
Sherwood, was arrested by Officer Wil
liam P. Daltnn and brought to the Sev
enteenth-street station, where a charge of
manslaughter was placed opposite his
name. He was immediatelw released on
his own recognizance.
GERMAN LADIES' PICNIC.
The Benevolent Society Celebrates Its
Eleventh Anniversary at Shell
Mound Park.
Over 1000 members and friends of the
German Ladles' Benevolent Society went
to Shell Mound Park yesterday to cele
brate the eleventh annual picnic of the
organization. The arrangements were in
the hands of the following ladies: Mrs.
V. "Wrede. Mrs. Johansen. Mrs. Stein,
Mrs. Hummel and Mrs. Dornbludth. The
reception committee was composed of C.
Stein. Mr. Beenhorman, C. Paul, A. Top
ken and C. Wills. During the day young
and old enjoyed dancing to music ren
dered by Yon der Mehden's band. The
interest of the children was centered on
the booth just outside the entrance to the
pavilion, where everything from a sofa
pillow to a coffee pot was in evidence
and for sale. The ladies vied with each
other in their endeavor to please all who
attended, and the success of the affair
was due to their untiring efforts. The
proceeds of the picnic will be turned into
the funds of the Rev Cross Society, with
which the ladles have associated them
selves in many ways during the past
year.
PATRIOTIC SERVICES HELD.
Bey. Dr. Cherington Preaches a Ser
mon at the Plymouth Church.
The Junior Order of United American
Mechanics and Daughters of Liberty at
tended last evening's services at the
Plymouth Conprgational Church In a
body. The church was tastefully dec
orated for the occasion with American
flags. Promptly at 7:30 o'clock the
services began with an organ voluntary,
"America." A selected quartet sang sev
eral patriotic airs, which were followed
by a stirring sermon by the pastor of the
church the Rev. F. B. Cherington. D.D.
He took for his text part of the eleventh
verse of the eighth chapter of Deuter
onomy. "Therefore you shall keep all the
commandments which I command you
this day." Dr. Cherington said that In
looking through the congregation he
could see that most of the young people
were just on the threshold of lire; he
urged them to be good, brave, strong and
manly. The service was drawn to a close
by the whole congregation singing "The
Star-spangled Banner."
rob the place when Landis returned.
In support of this theory they were
told by Tony and Manuel Arrunda,
who pass.,] close to the store on Sixth
Btreet at 10:10 o'clock, that they heard
a noise from the inside as if a number
of boxes had fallen.
Any number of people heard the
two shots, which, from various state
ments, wore llrt-d with an interval of
eight or ten seconds between. Frank
Crane, Tom Anderson. C. Hislop, Will
Berry Qua Casino and Waiter Sagee
say they were tired at 10:46 o'clock.
Constable Hughes, M. Matzen, C. C.
Allen, a druggist, Mrs. Frith, O.
Stafford, Peter Anderson, Marshal E.
W. Redding, P. S. Davis, and A. C.
Fleming, the Southern Pacific agent,
say the shots were flred between 10:45
and 10:50 o'clock.
Some stress was laid by the sup
porters of the suicide theory on the
fact that L^ndis had taken three
drinks during the evening. They
claimed it was an unusual proceeding
on the part of the young merchant,
and pointed to it as a circumstance
that he had taken liquor to brace his
nerve for suicide. The detectives
have found any number of people
who say not only was it L.andis* cus
tom to take several drinks hefore
going to bed. but that that night in
particular he did not drink of his
own motion, having been invited on
each occasion. His return to the
store was also in line with his cus
tom, and the theory that he did so
and was killed by burglars also leads
to the additional supposition that the
man or men inside were unaware of
this habit of his and were surprised
at his return.
The theory of the Placer Sheriff
that the bullet found in the store
partition was from l^andis' revolver
is not borne out by the facts. The bul
let was brought to this city last week
by Deputy Sheriff Stevens and taken
by him to A. Browning, a gunsmith
ni fc2<> Kearny street, to whom he was
recommended by Chief of Police
Lees. The gunsmith examined the
bullet in his presence and that of a
Pinkerton operative, and decided
positively that it had not come from
LandiB 1 revolver.
Here the case rests. The detectives
â were employed to determine whether
or not murder had been committed.
The evidence they have unearthed
answers in the affirmative. They were
not employed to hunt down the mur
derer, whom they think was a
stranger at Lincoln. It remains to
be seen if he will ever be caught.
