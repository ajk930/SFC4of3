PORTO PLATA, via Hayti, July 2T â
According to all information obtain
able at the present time the assassina
tion of Presidenr*Heureaux was due ze'
personal animosities. The assassin
seems to have seized t'r.r occasion of
some political ferment connected with
the financial crisis which has arisen
in Santo Domingo over the redemption
of paper currency.
An Insurrection was feared, owing to
the number of malcontents, and Presi
d-r.t Heureaui went to the north and
west >i the island to prepare for ail
â¢=veri:<jalitie~. In the province of Cibao,
at Moca. h- visited Jacob Lara, at
tended by only six persons. Ke was
about to leave Moca for Santiago de
las Caballeros when he was killed.
Booted and spurred ready to mount his
.orse. he sat under the feallery of a
h i-use '-" the Rue Colon talking with
-.a friends at 4 -.SO o'clock in the after
noon, when an old man approached to
ask tor alms.
Just as the President gave the old
man some money Ramon Caceres. the
assassin, rushed forward quickly and
fired twice from his revolver. One bul
let struck the 'heart of the President,
killing him instantly, and the second
bullet killed the old man by his side.
The crime was committed so rapidly
that the friends of the President were
not able to interfere in time to prevent
it. but they fired a number t_-f shots at
Caceres. who ran away, accompanied
by several persons. The assassin's party
returned the tire of the President's
friends and Caeeres escaped. It is not
known "whether he was wounded or r.ot.
The authorities immediately ser.t troops
to pursue him.
The body of President Heureaux was
taken to the hcuse of the Governor of
Moca and afterward to Santiago <ie las i
Cabail^ros. attended by a Government
e=oort -n?!*l members of "h* hi**? FÂ¥esf- [
<l*nt"s Tamily.
The President's widow requested that
the remains should be transported by
railway to Porto Plata and from there
to Santo Domingo by sea. but the Gov
ernor of Santiago feared disorder if the
body should be removed from thÂ°re by
train.
On arrival at Santiago thr- body was
taken tothe cathedral, and the Her
ald's special correspondent at Fort r>>
France states that, the Governor in
t" irmed Mme. Heureaux that the inter
ment would take place in that city on
account of the decomposition of the j
body! The true cause of the decision,
the correspotider.t adds, is that the au- I
thoritfes feared that the carriage of the
r-rna:r.= across toe island would pro-;
â â  â  '-:- dis lrder.
The companions of Caceres when '
PTÂ«rSid-nt Heureaux - .vas f killed were:
Juan Pichardo and Hcracio Vasquez. :
The- last named i? a brother of a deputy
in Parliament, and all three were im
portant personage? in the locality. The
father cf Caceres. the assassin, was put
to death by order of President Keu
reaax in ISS4.
The news of the President.'? death
spread rapidly and caused much emo- ,
tiort among the inhabitants of tr.r isl
and.
â¢ ; The sJtnation i= "critical, as the er.e
mies of the Government are trying to
disturb the peace and. a panic was;
caused by the assassination. The new \
President will continue the plan of :
..xtijthdrawing paper money.
â¢'â¢ It is said that one Juan Isidore Jim- ;
-enez. .who took part in the attempted 'â¢
â¢insurrection of June. i^*. is a candi
date fcr the Presidency.
I*, is r<=P>3rtC'd that < J^r.-raJ Maximo
Gomez, former President o* the Cuban
' ir.surrectior.ist?. v.ho is a native of
Santo Domingo, also aspires tv the
Presidency.
Vice- President de Figuereo at once
took precautions to prevent disorder
ar.d issued orders to the troops to that
*-rA. but up to the present all is quiet.

PARIS. Juiy ?7.â Genera! de Galli
fet is adding- to his reputation as
a great executioner. His vigor
ous action with regard to Gen
exai de Xegrier has m^ade a sen
sation. The Nationalists are furious.
while the Dreyfusites are jubilant, it
i appears, according to the Matin, that
General de Gallifet had been informed
that a colonel of a regiment in garrison
at Dijon had spoken before the assem
â  bled officers in a manner neither srex!
j for discipline nor flattering to the Gov-
The Minister cf War immediately'
, summoned this officer to Paris and
said to him:
"I am told that you have eix^en in
â  structions to your men incompatible
'< with discipline. Is it true?"
"Yes. general."'
"Well, you have committed a grave
fault."
"I obeyed my orders, general," an

"WJio ortjemsd t**u *Â»> siwsk In <he '
way you dtdT"
"Ger.erul de 'S^sri.T." vras the an- :
swer.
The colonel was sent back to Dijon,
and General de Xezrier received a sum
mons to call and see General de Galli
fet at the Ministry of "War.
As soon as General de Negrier arriv- j
cd. General de Gallifet. with his cus-
I tomary bluntness. ?aid: '-You have sent
j a communication .to the officers of the ;
Eighth Army Corps that is inadmis- ;
sible. as well . - being a serious act
against discipline. Here is the text, j
furnished me by the colonel who re- â¢
ceived it from you. Do you acknowl- i
edge its authenticity""
General de Negrrier disputed certain
passages of the document, written down
from memory by the colonel and read
aloud by General de Galiifet.
"Very well." said the Minister of War.
in reply to De Nesrier's contention, i
"give me the exact text of your order '
of the day."
"I have not gr>z it with me," replied
General de Negrier. "but the general of |
the Eighth Army Corps has it. You j
have only to demand it from him."
"Not at all/ replied General de Galli- :
fet. abruptly. "This is a secret matter.
I don't intend that other people shall j
be set talking abcut it. Take the train j
to-night and go fetch the document."
General de Negrier at once started
off, but as he had not returned in forty
eight hours. General de Gallifet sent j
him a dispatch to quicken his move- i
rcents. When the text was compared i
with the one the colonel had transmit- [
ted to De Gallifet th-=re was found ex- |
ceedihgly little difference in them, so I
General de Negrier's case was prompt- j
iy submitted to the Council of Minis- :
ters. and as promptly dealt with by the j
dismissal of the offending general. The j
only regret felt is that his brilliant rec- ;
ord should have been overshadowed at
its end fey such an indefensible act.

PARIS. July 27. â M. Jean Hess, the French explorer
and writer on colonial subjects, after passing- three weeks at
Manila, rite* a long letter dated Hongkong. June 20, which
the Figaro publishes this morning.
In regard to American prospects M. Hess says thai un
less there is some extraordinary and improbable event, such
as the treason of some Filipino chief, tempted by a big bribe.
the Americans will need in order to make progress much
time, very- much money and great quantities oi men. The
more they progress the great will be the difficulties they
will meet with.

of the firing line. Corbin recently gay*
out Wheatbn's report, but realizing the
gravity of the material now <_>r. his
desk, is doing some press censoring in
the interest of Otis.
Among the officers whose reports are
being suppressed are. it is understood.
Generals Lawton and Mac Arthur.
Ovenshine. Hale and Hall have not
been heard from.
It may be stated that thf suppressed
reports constitute; in the opinion of
army officers, ground for court-martial
or. the score of inefficiency. The charges
that can be formulated against General
Otis are:
1. That he issued conflicting orders.
â  2. That he left a body of American
troops in vital danger by ordering that
body to retreat.
3. That in Manila, for several months
before fighting began, he failed to ex
plore the country beyond a radiU3 of
ten miles from Manila.
L That he w-as in totat ignorance of
the topography of the country in which
he was fighting, despite time and op
p<Ttunities to learn it.
5. That purposeless orders caused
confusion to the quartermaster and
commissary departments and resulted
in suffering and in some instances
death to soldiers starvation.
The te!esrams prove that Lawton on
at least two occasions was left to shift
far himself in a precarious position as
a result of a revocation of orders is
sued originally to Mac Arthur. -who was
first instructed to support Lawton and
then was told to retreat or change his
base, with the effect of a retreat.
LONG-RANGE RIFLES
SECURED FROM JAPAN
VICTORIA. B. C-. July ?'.-Among [
the passengers on the Rio Jun Maru ;
was Dr. W. D. Eastlake. He has been
introducing trolley systems into Tokio j
and cities of Japan. The doctor brings
interesting news from Manila. At To- |
koharr.a he conversed with a number ;
of men fresh from the Otis campaign.
Two days before the Rio Jun jailed the
Boston arrived on her way to San ;
Francisco. The transport Hancock '
reached the Japanese port at the same ',
time with 900 homeward bound Utah
men, and shortly afterward the hos
pita] ship Relief came in. She left on ;
the iGth for San Francisco with 300 |
Kansas men on board in various stages i
of sickness- The doctor says the Re- j
lief is a three-decked scow vessel suit- j
able only for river travel, unsatisfac- I
tori' and uncomfortable.
Two or three cases on board the Re- j
lief are of special interest. One is that \
of Captain Bradley of the Tenth Kan- ;
sas, who is going home with a bullet;
back of his heart. He hopes to re
cover, but Eastlake says he is doomed j
and will probably die before he reaches
San Francisco. Speaking of the cam
paign Captain Bradley eulogizes Otis, i
and says the coolnÂ«ss and bravery of i
even raw recruits under galling fire â 
v.ere admirable. Notwithstanding the
tact that the .American troops ... j
posed to be better armed, the Filipinos t
seem to always get the range first, and i
the Americans are forced to rush sev- j
era! hundred yards before getting !
wir'ain striking distance.
A sensational feature is given to th j
situation by. the recently discovered i
explanaticn of this. As the nature of |
the wounds received by the Americans *
J showed that the rebels had a deadly
â¢ weapon of exceedingly long range, in
â  vestigation was made which showed
that a Japanese firm had supplied the
; Filipinos with the long-carrying Mv
! rata, rirle, against which Krag-Jorgen
' sens are ineffectual.
The Muratas were sent from Tokio
I with a secret filibustering expedition.
; which successfully landed the arms on
j a small coasting steamer early in the

ELECTION FRAUDS IN
NEBRASKA PROVEN
Committee Found Crooked Work in
the Recount On Constitutional
Amendments.
OMAHA. July 27.â At the last session
of the Nebraska Legislature a commit
tee of three was appointed by the Sen
ate to Investigate certain charges rela
tive to aliened irregularities in the re
count of ballots on a constitutional
amendment relating to increasing the
number of Judges of the Supreme
Court as wet! as other matters in con
nection with the official conduct of cer
tain State officers. The report of the
committee was completed in this city
to-day "and forwarded to the Governor.
The report embodies the history of the
investigation, substantially as it was
published while the committee was in
session, and concludes with a dignified
appeal to the Governor to do his duty
and punish the parties whose guilt is
indicated.
The committee declares that charges
of fraud in connection with the re
; count of the constitutional amendments
: has been sustained by the most con
clusive evidence, as well as by the ap
pearance of the ballots themselves.
It finds that ex-Governor Holcomb
has misappropriated at least STT3 of the
amount drawn by him on account of
house rent during his term of office and
recommends that the Attorney General
be instructed to take the necessary
steps to recover the amount and return
it to the treasury.

WALLA- July 27.â Paul Corcoran j
was to-day found guilty of the murder
of James Cheyr.e. who died as the \
result of gunshot wounds the day the j
Bunker Hill and Sullivan ' mill was |
blown up at Wardner.
The jury was out about thirteen
boons and returned its verdict a few I
minutes after 10 o'clock morning-.
This afternoon Judge Stewart sen
tenced Corcoran to seventeen years' im- I
prisonment at hard labor in the Idaho >
penitentiary. The court then adjourn- i
ed until September.
Shortly after & o'clock last night 'â 
Judge Stewart, completed his charge
and the jury filed out. As the hours
went past and no report came from th,e
jury-room, the belief grew stronger
that no verdict could be reached: that
the jury must disagree, and. indeed,
had one man possessed a firmer will â¢.
there is no telling how/long the verdict |
would have been withheld.
Never for one moment did Corcoran
| have a chance of going free. Within
: twenty minutes after the jury filed out
lof the courtroom last night .- is said
' eleven men had agreed upon the ver- J
[ diet of "murder in the second degree." \
Only or.? held out. He insisted that the
j crime was murder in the first degree.
I Hour after hour he withstood the ar- j
guments of his comrades. Not until
daylight was dawning did he waver, !
and a* iast all agreed upon the verdict >
i of murder in the second degree, the l
penalty for which is from ten years to â 
, life imprisonment.
It was not without careful delibera- f
! tion that Corcoran was chosen by the I
! State as the first man of all the huh- <
dreds in the Wardner bull en to be
tried for the crimes of the mob. From '
the first he was recognized as a ieadtr 1
! in the councils of the men "who incited ;
I the riots. He " a as 'financial '+ |
â¢ of the Burke Union and a delegate to j
I the Central Union. It was belle that j
'he was directly responsible for the I
: sending: of a large number of the noters |
â  from Burke on that day. Witnesses i
! brought before the Coroner's jury j
â  swore that they had seen him on the j
i train with the rioters to Kellogg, i
\ and others swore that he had been seen i
\ with that particular section of the mob !
I from which the shot was fired that kill- I
ed James Cheyne.
The trial began three weeks ago and j
, has been bitterly contested. Both sides '
; employed the ablest lawyers that could f
be engaged. Not one point was lost. |
The State did nc< claim that it was i
Corcoran's hand that fired the fatal j"
j shot, but it rested its entire case upon j
the evidence that he had been a leader I
| in plotting the riot and that he was [
I with the band of men by whom the I
â¢ murder was committed.
The defense denied that Corcoran was |
I with the mob. attacked the character j
lof the State's witnesses, declared the j
'â  State was resolved to override every
\ right of union men and punish all of
| them for the crime of a single member
of the mob.
The verdict, while not unexpected.
; has created great excitement here. Had
!an acquittal resulted it is generally
I known the prosecution would have dis
j missed nearly all the other cases. Now
i it is likely all will be pressed and trials
I will begin in September, to iast many
j months.
George Crad I and John Asman.

I murder of Schmidt and James Cheyne, i

Covington (Ga.) correspondent â which
says that a mob of fifty masked men
made away with three Mormon eiders
who have been proselyting in Jasper
County.
The story is to the effect that three
elders visited the ht-me of William
Cunnard. near Xewton Factory. Jas
per County, yesterday and endeavored
to persuade Mrs. Cunnard to join the
church. While :hey were at the Cun
nard house fifty men. masked and on.
horseback, came up and asked the
elders to accompany them.
They refused to do so. and while they
were parleying: Mr. Cunnard cured a
rifle and aided the mob in taking the
elders. Several shots were exchanged.
In the excitement Mrs. Cunnard had
her jaw shattered.
The mob finally secured the elders
and v rode off with them. Nothing has
been seen of them since. The Mormons
were driven out of two towns in Jas

TOO MUCH MEDICINE
CAUSES TWQ DEATHS
Physician Declares the Parents of
Sick. Children Did Hot Follow
Directions.
STOCKTON. July 27.â Martin Laurit
zen lives with hi? family eighteen miles
southwest of Los Banos. Last week
his four children each had an attack of
whooping couch, and on Monday LavÂ»
ritzen went to Los Banos to see Dr.
Wade. The medicine prescribed by Dr.
Wade was administered on Tuesday
and shortly thereafter two of the chil
dren died, the deaths occurrinz within
an hour of each other. The children
, were Minnie, aged IC<- 3Bd._Clara, aged
'If.
Dr. "Wade says he rave careful direc
tions as to how the medicine should
be administered and expressly stated
that it was to be given only durtns
paroxysms of couching. As whoopinz.
couch must run its course of six or
seven weeks, the medicine was not in
tended as a curative, but as a relief tor
the children.
It <=eems however, that the directions
upon the bottle read: -One teaspoonful
every hour if required." The quantity
gone out of the bottle indicated that
the medicine was given with more fre
quency than the physician intended.
This, briefly told, is me doctors ver
sion of the sad affair, but the people
around Los Banos are not sansned
with the explanation and are strenu
ously insisting that additional licht bÂ«
thrown upon the matter.
On Monday Dr. F. E. Lilly and Dr.
C. K. Cast went to Los Banos to hold
ai inquest. The bodies cf the children
were yesterday exhumed and viewed
by the jury- Th * stomachs were re
moved and" will be sent to San Fran
cisco for a thorough chemical analysis
by experts.
The verdict of the Coroners jury
wili be withheld tiU the report of the
experts is received, and upon it will
largely depend whether or not criminal
charees aYe to be preferred against Dr.
Wade. Public sentiment is much- di
vided as to the necessity of these un
usual proceedings, as Dr. Wade's stand
Â«nsr in th* community has never before
been called into question.

Under the Circumstances No Fear of

Special !â ' -â¢ : â â !) to The Call,
WASHINGTON. July 27.â Reports that
Japan and Russia are arming for a strug
gle over Korea are received with much 1
allowance in the â¢ diplomatic quarters
chiefly concerned, and it is pointed out
that an entente cordiale was arranged be
tween the two countries last year concern-
Ing affairs In Korea. This arrangement
is still in force and there has been no .
evidence that either government desired j
to depart from it. It is In -the Formosa
protocol, dated at Tokio. April 25 IS9S. ;
and is signed by Baron Rosen; Russian
Minister to Japan, and Baron Nissi,
Plenipotentiary for Japan, Its main pro- I
visions an as follows :
"The Imperial Governments of Russia
and Japan recognize definitely the sov
ereignty and Independence of Korea and
mutually agree between themselves to
abstain from interference in the internal
affairs of the country.
"Desiring to avoid all possible cause for
misunderstanding, the Governments of
Russia and Japan mutually engage in
ease Korea has recourse to the counsel or
assistance either of Russia or Japan, not ;
to take measures for the nomination of j
military Instructors and of councilors of
finances without previously reach! a
mutual accord on the subject.
"In view of the development attending
the commerce and industry of Japan in !
Korea and the considerable number of
Japanese residing In Corea. the Govern- ;
ment of Russia will not interfere in the
development of the commerce and Indus
try between Japan and Korea."
This protocol is said to have brought
about a satisfactory condition of affairs
in Korea, and of late no word has reached
here that the former strained relations
between Japan and Russia had been re- '
newed. It Is recognized in diplomatic
quarters on both sides that each Govern
merit has a deep Interest in Korea and
that neither is likely to submit to any
move contrary to the protocol which may
bring in question the sovereignty of ivo- â 
rea. ;

MOST IMPORTANT
ALASKAN LANDMARK
The New Eddystone in the Mouth of Behm Canal, .as Pictured
by Vancouver in 1793 (Published in London, 1801).
r Pi:e Canadian claim that the framers of the Anglo-Russian treaty of i<>2r>, by which the boundary between what is
now Alaska and British America w;is fixed, substituted by mistake Portland canal for Behm canal, which lies some
thirty miles to the west, in defining the course of the boundary north from parallel .".4 degrees J" minutes to parallel 56 de
grees, can and no pood standing.
Thi very accurat â  maps made by the explorer Vancouver, based on carefjul and extended surveys of the three chan
nels leading to the north from Dixon entrance, through which runs parallel 54 degrees 40 minutes, from which the bound
ary line "ascends t<> the north." and the pictured landmarks thereon, with full and definite description of each, left no
room for mistake on the part of the British treaty makers, who had all this data and had no >ther from English Bources
before them on which to base their agreement with Russia. Vancouver sailed into Observatory Inlet, the most eastern and
the shortest of the three arms of Dixon entrance running to the north, established an observatory station on the shore
and made personally a careful survey of thai Inlet and Portland canal, lying in xi to the west, and of Behm canal, still
farthest west, which he found only encircled an island and did not extend Into the mainland at all. He found Portland
canal, which he named in honor of the noble family of Bentinck, to be aboui seventy miles long and to reach nearly to
parallel r.i degrees north i~.i degrees 15 minutes-he put It), ending in a long marsh, which he did noi explore. Behm canal,
which was named In honor of the Russian Commodore Behm, who had been very kind to them in Kamschatka some
years I .tore, he put down ; i^ running up to parallel 56 degrees 30 minuses, then southwest again Into Clarence Strait at
parallel 55 minutes, mapping and describing it in terms which in no sensi allow the fitting to it of the language
used In the treatj of 1825, which says that from parallel 56 degrees 40 minutes "the said line shall ascend to the north
along the channel called Portland canal as far as the point of the continent where it strikes the fifty-sixth degree of north
latitude."
In t he fa f Vancouver's maps and pictures and descriptions thereof the Canadians will have to abandon the Behm-
Portland changeling story.

SAX JOSE. July 27.-I,uix Argues, B. S. |
Hurlhurt. F. F. Brttton, H. T. Besae and \
C. \v. Ohilds. the executive committee of
the depositors of the Tnion Savings Bank,
to-day began another suit against that
hanking Institution. It is brought on the
assigned claims of about 700 depositor*
against the Union Savings Bank for about
$320,1)06, ranging in amounts from $20 to
nearly that many thousands. J. R. Welch
is the attorney. The complaint states
the defendants have demanded this money j
but have failed to obtain any of it.
This is the seventh suit brought by the
organized depositors, and the c.nd is nrÂ»i
yet. Another suit is shortly to be filed
and others are being considered. Besides,
! the stockholders a week ago decided to
investigate the affairs of the bank with
i view to placing criminal charges against
some of the old board of directors.
Nearly six months have elapsed sine.'
the Union Savings Bank closed its doors.,
and toe depositors have not yet received
one cent. A ." per cent dividend has been
promised on their accounts in August by
the directors. Judgment has been ob
tained against a number of the small
stockholders for their pro* Fata liability,
but this will be appealed. At the rate the
settlement is going on. years will elapse
before the depositors will receive . more
than a very small part uf their savings.
No attention lias been paid by the
stockholders to the $10 a share assessment
levied, and but two mi.-n have paid their
assessments, but t'-Vi going into the bank
from this source.
There is great dissatisfaction among
tin 1 depositors over the management of
the insolvent bank. President J. W. Rea.
who owes the bank $50(10. has not paid this
indebtedness, nor have Directors Simpson
and Dunlop paid the s^\>ral thousand, dol
lars they owe. There is no harmony in
the directorate, and President Rea. who
hvts been used to running polities, carries
things with a high hand.

ONCE.
The Prisoner Accused of Responsi
bility for the Drowning of
Two Men in El Oro
Mine.
Special Dispatch to The. Call.
REDWOOD CITY, July 27.â The friends
of H. C. Faulkner at this place have just
received intelligence from the Department
[of State, Washington, that the American
Ambassador at the City of Mexico had
1 been given instructions to 'investigate
Faulkner's case and" bring about his
prompt trial or release on bond.'
Faulkner is the "American who was act-;
', ing as engineer at El Oro mine in Mexico
in June last when Superintendent Lloyd
! and another man were drowned in the
cage let down into the mine. He was
given orders to let the cage down until
. he received a signal to stop and a place
was marked on the indicator to which he
could lower the "cage with safety. He
lowered to this point, but on receiving no
signal suspected something wrong and
stopped the cage. Upon examination it
! was discovered that the superintendent
i had thrown the signal rope beyond reach
of the cage and that the cage was sub
merged in water and its occupants
drowned.
Faulkner was arrested and thrown into
a cell with persons of the most degraded
type. He was refused a hearing and could
get no satisfaction from the Embassador
at the City of Mexico. He Wrote to friends
at this place and also sent a statement of
his case to Secretary Hay at Washington.
His Redwood City friends interested
themselves in his behalf and wrote to the
! authorities at Washington. In answer to
a letter sent to Secretary Hay the^ollow
ing has been received:
I have to acknowledge the receipt of your
letter of the 2d instant in relation to the im
prisonment in Mexico of H. C. Faulkner, an
American citizen. A letter dated the l!U"h ulti
mo was received from" Mr. Faulkner. Kivins
j particulars of his case; also one dated the 30th
ultimo stating that no answer to his previous
. one had yet reached him. In reply to your
letter I have to Bay that this department has
this day written to Mr. Faulkner informing
him that on June 29 a letter was addressed to
1 him informing him that a copy of his letter
j of June 1:1 was sent to our Embaosador at
the City of Mexico, with instructions to investi
gate his case and report to this department,
' and meanwhile to ask for Mr. Faulkner's
I prompt trial or release on bond. Your obe
dient servant, DAVID .\ HILL.,
Assistant Secretary.
Additional information concerning the
; , cident for which Faulkner has been im
prisoned is iearned from a Mexican news
paper recently received. Faulkner had
been employed at El Oro mine but a short
time when the accident occurred. II. â¢ was
not acquainted with the duties of an en
gineer at such a place. The authorities
claim that the deaths were due to criminal
carelessness, when Superintendent Lloyd
started to go down the shaft he told the
engineer that it would be Impossible to
live more than fifteen minutes at the bot
tom and to hold himself in readiness to
hols) the cage as soon as the signal was
given. The signal was not given and be
cause it was not Faulkner allowed the
cage to remain in the shaft several hours.
When the body of the superintendent was
taken home his wife weni hopelessly in
sane. Further advices are expected at
any time.

The Deal Is Being Engineered by A.
B. Hammond â Cold-Storage
Companies Unwilling to
Get in Line. , .
Special Dispatch to The Cm!!.
A.STORIA, Or., July 27.â A report is
current here thaj A. B. Hammond, presi
dent of the Astoria and Columbia River a
Road Company, is in Portland at present^
endeavoring to bring about an amalga
mation of all the Ashing interest? ol
Lower Columbia. <>f course this rumor
eai*not be verified, for the deal is being
secretly consummated, .but it is pretty
gem rally belies ed in this city.
Early in the yen Mr. Hammond engi
neered a scheme whereby several of iMo
packers of this i ity combined. It w:is
; proposed by the promoters to get all the
packing bouses on the tower m'.r into the
combine, hut their expectations were not
realized, for only about one-third of the
canners were induced to go Into th-- at
tempted monopoly. The combination waa
i regarded here as an effort to control tho
immense Industry, the output of which
i amounts to nearly tour millions oJC dollars
i annually, and then to reduce the uric.' ot
, raw matt-rial. Had the plan opi
' successfully fhe 1000 fishermen who Hvj
in Astoria might to-d|iy be working for
Jl a (Jay instead of receiving from o to S
cents a pound for their salmon.
The cord storages have been a thorn in
the side of the combine. They have of"
fi-rerl l (â¢â¢â in a pound more than has been
offered by the packers, and in i onse
i quence have received the tish taken by

a price which enables them to pay not
; more than 5 cents, although they an pay

scarcity of tish.
Realizing the utter impossibility ot
I forming an effective combine without get
' ting the cold storages Into the deal, an
effort is now being made to buy up all the
; canneries not now in the combine an- 1
also the cold storage plants, if this can
be done the combine will be complete and
i the trust will be able to dictate its qwn
â  price for salmon. The amount ol capi
! tal necessary to purchase this interest
would be very great but tin- promoters
of the scheme have ample backing. Lo
cally the effort is regarded seriously, and

CLEVELAND. July 27.â Mayor Far
ley purposes to conduct the campaign
against lawlessness in Cleveland on the
lines he has laid down and he will not
tolerate any interference. That was
mr.de clear at the special meeting Of
the City Council this evening:, when the
attempt to Institute an investigation of
the strike on the big Consolidated
Street Railway's lines by a special com
mittee of that body, was defeated.
When the previous strike was settled
- â  â 
a month ago an agreement between
rhe company and the strikers was
brought about by a special committee
of the Council. The agreement provid
ed for the taking back of a certain per
centage of the old men. for the re ten- I
tlon of a certain number <-f new men j
and for the loyal treatment of the com- |
pahy and the now men by the old men
who were taken back.
When the present strike was inaugu- ;
rated, it was charged that the agree- i
merit had been violated by the com- j
par.y, and on the other hand, the com- ;
pany charged that the men had not |
be*n loyal to it or the non-unionists. It ;
was the purpose of the special commit
mittee of the Council to-night to JU- ,
thorize that committee to institute a j
semi-Judicial investigation of the pres- i
ent strike by siibperiaing witnesses and i
sending for books and papers to aseer- â 
tain whether the agreement had been j
lived up to. and to inform the public
where the blame for the strike lay.
Mayor Farley opposed the proposed j
actii n in a vigorous speech, in which
he declared that the appointment of the
special committee would Inter! with
the plans of the executive for the j
crushing out of the disorder. He said
the only result would b* to keeu alive \
the agitation and that no good pur
pose would be served.
"In time of peace." he declared, "pre
pare for war, but when you have war j
the best thing- to do is to bring about
peace") but that cannot be done by keep
ing up the agitation which caused the
war. This seems to be a good time.":
the Mayor declared, "for everybody to
mind his own business."

the appointment of the committee, but j
when ihe resolution came to a vote
it was lost.

The
cars were operated on most of th.- lines
on nearly the usual schedules, â it in :
some parts of the city â¢ hey ran almost
empty, the boycott of the lines !/y the
working people being almost universal. :
President Everett says, however, that ;
he does not believe the boycott is ef- '
fective. He thinks people are deterred
from riding by the fear of personal In
jury and he says that as soon as the !
safety of passengers is assured, the cars j
will be filled as usual.
The boycott has extended to the sol
diers. Merchants are refusing to sell :

of organized labor have refused to pat- i

money for anything or supplies any of â 
his wants.
Th- Mayors of the suburban villages I
had a meeting to-day, at which the i
presence of troops in Col wood and
South Brooklyn were discussed. The i
Mayors of both these hamlets said j
troops were not needed.
Mayor Phelps of South Brooklyn said ;
he did not particularly object to the !
presence of the soldiers, but said the j
whole trouble was caused by the non- ';
union men who fired revolvers In the '
air recklessly. To-night the troops ;
were withdrawn from Collinwood, on I
the promise of the Mayor to preserve I
Thx-re was grave apprehension of j
trouble to-night. It had bÂ»en announc- I
'â¢ii that there would be a meeting of '
ttrike sympathizers in th public square j
and the police had been instructed to !
prevent it. It appears, however, that
the announcement was unauthorized,
for while a small crowd assembled.:
there was no attempt to hold a meeting '
and consequently no trouble occurred.

of Henry Cornzwelt last Monday by a |
non-union conductor named Ralph
Hawley has been In progress for two

tinV-d thus far have told practically the
same story which is to the effect that
the shooting was unjustifiable, the boy ;
having dune nothing which would have ,

Santa Rosa Merchant Barely Escapes
Being Bitten by the
Reptile.
SANTA ROSA. July 27.â M. Prince, a
merchant of this city, had an experience
to-day he will not be apt to soon forget:
Opposite his place of business on Fourth
street is in empty store room in which
he had some fixtures stored. This after
noon he took a friend across the street
to show him a piece of shelving. Unlock
ing th* door the two men proceeded to in
spect the furniture. As Mr. Prince stooped
to lift a box cover he heard an ominous
rattle directly under his feet. As he made
a jump backward a huge rattlesnake
struck at him viciously, narrowly missing
his hand. The two men succeeded in dis
patching the reptile, but not until it had
put up a good tijrht.
The snake must have been one that es
caped from a traveling snake charmer
known as Professor Zeno, who visited this
city two months ago and showed In the
store room referred to. The reptile was
fat and sleek and had probably subsisted
on mice during its Imprisonment If Pro
fessor Zeno lost one of his pets while

CONTRACT LABORERS
COMING FROM ITALY
One Thousand Will Soon Pass Through
the United States on the Way
to .Hawaii.
WASHINGTON, July 27.â Arran pements are being made to take 1000
contract laborers from Italy to Hawaii. Owing to Congress' failure to
enact laws for Hawaii or extend the immigration laws of the L nited
States to the islands there is no restriction upon the introduction of
contract laborers, and it is even proposed to transport the Ital
ians through the United States. Commissioner General of Immigration
Powderly said to-day that he had been asked by transportation lines as
to the possibility, and said there was no way in which this Government
Interfere, though the men would, of course, be inspected to as
certain if any came within the prohibition from landing in this country
on account of disease or liability to become public charges. The trans
ition lines will probably be required to give a bond to insure the
I'nitr-d States against immigrants separating from the main body.
In anticipation of the extension of the United States immigration laws
to Hawaii in the next session of Congress thero has been a rush to take
contract laborers into the island*. Some Chinamen have been taken in.
but most of the immigrants since annexation are Japanese, of whom
there had been 12.180 up to last May. All but 1197 ot these were contract
laborers. At the present rate before Congress can enact any legislation
th^- population of the island will be overwhelmingly Asiatic.

The men claim there has been even yet j
no official announcement of the cut, but
they are not allowing that fact to pre
vent them seeking to have the old sched
ule restored. As soon a.< it became noised
abroad that wages were to go down, the
men affected met and organized and a
- test from each trade was drawn up
and presents .Iâ by some to the command
ant of the yard, by others to the board
of wages and by several to the Navy De
partment direct. The blacksmiths went
so far as to send a committee down to
San Frarnctsco to investigate wages from
the standpoint of the men, and the rates .
the committee brought back were much
higher than the new schedule. It was
claimed that in investigating San Fran
cisco rates the board went no farther than
the Union Iron Works, and the men say
the rates there are lower than anywhere
else on the coast. They claim investiga
tion will show that $4 .V) is not high pay
for good blacksmiths, and the navy yard
wants only the best.
When the committee returned with its
facts the blacksmiths met and drew up
the following protest, which was sent to
Washington after It had been submitted
to Admiral Kempff. and he had told the
men that Washington was the only place
where the matter could be settled.
VALLEJO, July 15, ISM.
lion John D. Long, Secretary of the Navy,
Washington, D. Câ Sir: ThÂ» undersigned ship
smith? and blacksmiths now employed at the
navy yard. Mare Island, do most earnestly and
respectfully protest against the action of the
board appointed by the honorable Secretary
of the Nat â  to regulate the wa)?et> of em
ployes at this station for the ensuing six
months.
This board has reduced wages, as per sched
ule enclosed, and we claim that the reduc
tions are not to the best Interests of the Gov
ernment and therefore tx>g your careful con
sideration ami most earnestly petition that you
"may see fit to restore the old rate of * 4 4S for
the" following reasons:
The wages we have been receiving are not
aÂ« high as those paid by outside firms, and
we are entitled by law to equal pay with out
side firms.
We are entitled to the best pay, not the low
est nor the average.
Enclosed we send rates of wares paid in
San Francisco to first-class smiths.
In the next place there is a demand for
first-class mechanics at our trade, and during
the late war the list at the Labor Bureau was
exhausted repeatedly. Smiths could not be
procured when they were badly Deeded. At
the present time, as then, many are called, but
few are able to do the work required and
ninny quit of their own accord when they find |
that they not only have to do a good day's
work but that they have to be ( first-class me
chanics to perform a good day's work.
None but first-class mechanics can do the
work required of us and that we can and do
perform. Witness the Monadnock, our steel
Â»nlp built here entirelyâ hull, engines, boil
ers and equipments. We will place the Mo
nadnock alongside any ship in the navy and
defy a comparison as to expense for repairs ]
and durability of workmanship.
Witness the report of every constructor and
every chief engineer attached to this station
for years past up to the last reports.
Finally, wages are on the advance all over j
our common country. Labor is more in de
mand than for years past, and It Is not to j
the Interests of our Government that its of- j
fleers should be the first to stem jtbls tide by j
reducing the pay of the tried and efficient i
citizen of this country. 3 -*" bettter to advance
us the l<) per cent l -- has been done by so j
many great" firms, which would '..ring our rate
up to what is paid in San Franciscoâ s4 43 per
day. our old rate.
Similar protests were drawn up by the
other trades and were put through the j
i same course. Then State Senator Luch- â 
' singer took up the fight by sending the j
i following telegram to the Secretary of j
i the Navy:
VA___JO, July 14. 1899
To Hon John D. Long. Secretary of the
! Navy. Washington. D C . Can the adminis
! tration afford to cut wages In the navy yard
1 with prosperity in other branches and wages
i increased? Great dissatisfaction among em- ,
â  ployes who may enlist labor organizations to
co-operate. Would respectfully suggest re
consideration of Board of Wages' action as a I
matter at justice and the party's welfare.
J. J L.UCHSINGEB, State Senator.
Congressman Loud. Congressman Met
calf. Congressman Kahn, Speaker Ander- i
i son and Major McLaughlin also sent tele- i
, grams and all the Influence that could be ;
! brought to bear was exerted In favor of |
! the men.
li: answer to Senator Luchsingers tele
-1 gram the Secretary of the Navy wrote
I that he would have the board of wages
i convene again for a careful Investigation
! of the matter a second time, and that
afterward the board would send all the j
data upon which it had based its findings
to the department. This is taken to mean
I that there will be a revision of the .-hod- i
ule and that the old rate will again be j
1 put in force. i
The men claim that wages at the yard ;
are no* below what skilled mechanics
are able to secure outside, and they be
lieve the rate enforced by the Govern-]
ment has a tendency to lower wages all i
I over the coast. Wages ire being raised '
I everywhere else, they say, and the lirst j
; movement toward a reduction should not
; come from the Government. Wages at !
the yard are based upon wages outside, !
; but it is argued that when they are kept !
: down at the yard they fall outside and j
i that entails a further reduction by tho }
' Government: as a consequence the down- '
1 ward tendency of the Government rate
i paves the way for its own further reduc
tion.
The officers of the board say they have j
complied strictly with tho regulations. ,
Captain Trilley declares there was a thor
ugh Investigation of the rates in San j
Francisco before the yard rates were '
â¢ touched. He Intimated that the schedule i
j was based on the rates paid in the Union, j
i Risdon and IJulton works, where he said
I many men .are employed for long
periods. The cut he said would affect less j
than 300 men.
The new rates are the subject of all
â¢ rsatl":'. among- the men coming or
Â£.-'>ine to the yard. They have seen three
reductions In the last few years and but
on.* raiseâ that of the blacksmiths during
the late warâ and tha,t they say was
: by th.> scarcity of men. They say
the work demand -d by tht- officers of the
yard must he first class In every respect
and a great deal of !â¢ is "old" work, or
work on "!<i materials, a class of labor
always paid for at a hipher rat* 1 than new
work. They claim the Government should
be the last to reduce, and should rather
k> â¢â ]! the scale bigh than start to lower
it. The outcome of the correspondence is
awaited with tbÂ« - interest

CARROLL SUCCEEDS ROLF.
New Chief of the Stockton Fire De-
partment.
STOCKTON. July 27.â The Democratic
Police and Fire Commissioners to-night
removed Chief Isra- 1 Rolf of the Fire De
partment and elected In his place px-Con
stable James P. Carroll. The action of
the board was in the face of strenuous
protests from the business community and
the insurance companies, who demanded I
that the present efficient department be
not turned over to petty politicians. Rolf
has been chief right years and made an I
enviable record.
John D. Gall, the present chief of Po- i
lice, wns re-elected. Dan Klench, a police- i
man. was made night captain.
There was a sensational scene when the
resolution electing Carroll was passed.
Rolf threw his keys and badge on the
table and paid he would turn over the de
partment to his successor at l'"i o'clock to
morrow, and if Carrol! were not on hand
the department could run Itself.

Perot of Baltimore on the charge of the
abduction of her daughter from Balti
more. Mrs. Perot was accompanied by a
tall, military looking man. and the party
had taken passage as Mr. and Mrs. Pierce
and daughter.
"Pierce" is Captain Blood, a brother of
Lady Colin Campbell. Mrs. Perot did not
deny her Identity. She bad not antici
pated arrest and was surprised. She took
j it quietly, but there was a painful scene
between mother and daughter when they
began to fear separation, the child wet-p
--ing bitterly. The police reassured the
mother for the present.
Mrs Perot was arraigned at th" P."W
street Police Court this afternoon and re
manded for one w. -k. The child will re
main In the custody of her mother. Bail.
with two sureties, was fixed at Â£I<X>. It
was furnished by Dr. C. E. Wansmith and
N. Blood.
When Mrs. Perot, her child and Mr.
Blood arrived at the Huston station th>-y
were greeted by Inspector Freest and the
correspondent of thÂ»- Associated Press. To
the latter Mrs. Perot said: --This is a puiv
â  case "f persecution, I assure you. Some
: of the proceedings arp utterly unwarrant
; able. If taking mv child away [s an In
dictable offense then I am guilty, perhaps,
legally; but every mother's heart will be
, with mo in this trouble. We bad no Idea
; <>f this further attempt in a lons series
iof houndings. If I return to America It
will be never to leave it without my child.
We an perfectly devoted, as y.-u can lm
' asrtne."'
Mr. Blood said: "There is no mystery
about this case. The statement that I
was traveling as Mr. Pierce Is untrue. I
am traveling under my own name. I ;tm
a very dear friend of Mrs. Perot and her
ch:ld and propose to stand by them. I
consider Perot, the grandfather, a scamp
to play this inhuman trick. 1 have en
paged the bÂ»-st extradition barrister i:i
London to tipht this case."
Patrick Rose-Innes, who appear* [ -
the prisoner, said to the correspondent of
the Associated Press after the hearing:
"There is not the slightest cause of ex
tradition in this cast-. Th>- English law
says abduction must be against the laws
of both Enelarel and the United SI tea
Mrs. Perot violated the American law
only."
Mrs. Perot and her child have pone to

FIGURES GIVE THE
SHAMROCK VICTORY
LONDON, July 27.â The Yachting World,
Issued to-day, contains a long article on
the Shamrock's chances in the contest for
the America's cup. Starting upon the as
sumption that the Vigilant and Britannia
were equal, the writer argues that the
Shamrock showed herself to be capable .if
beating the Britannia in a moderate
breeze twenty-five to twenty-six minutes
over a thirty-mile course. With time al
lowance the Shamrock's superiority would
he fifteen to twenty minutes. As the De
fender's superiority over the Vigilant in
palling the same course is estimated at six
minutes and the Columbia's superiority
over the Defender is assumed to be three
minutes, it is estimated that the Colum
bia's superiority over the Vigilant is nine
minutes. Therefore, according to the
Yachting World's article, there are ex
cellent grounds for the belief that In the
present condition of both yachts the
Shamrock will win.
BRISTOL, R. I.; July 27. -The Colum
bia's Steel mast was stepped to-day. It
was in place by 7 o'clock this morning, the
workmen having begun on it before day
light. All preparations possible were com
pleted last night, so that the final step
was accomplished easily and very quickly.
As it stands, the mast looks taller than
that of the Defender and is considerably
darker in color. The topmast. In con
formity with a new idea of her builders,

CLEVELAND, Ohio, July 27.â There

in the first heal, but was overhauled by
The Abbott, who finished first by a head.

SLAUGHTERING DUCKS
FOR THE EPICURES
GAME BEING KILLED IN VIOLA
TION OF LAW.
Arrest of Henry Mitchell for Having
Young Mallard and Teal Dur
ing the Close Season.
Henry Mitchell, head salesman of tho
poultry commission firm of O'Brien <fe
Spotorno In the California Market, was
arrested yesterday by Deputj Fish and
Game Commissioner Charles A. Vogelsang
for violating the State law which pro
hibits the sale or possession of wild
ducks In the closed season. The game In
question was a l"t of about five dozen
maHard and teal ducks. Nearly all of
them were so young that the pin feathers
had not been developed, but they were
very fat. The killing of ducks Is not per
mitted under the State law until October
l, and that the salesman knew that hn
was guilty was manifest by his actions.
Mr. Vogelsang was in the market when
the game arrived. It was securely packed
and the cover of the box was tirrnly nailed
down.
Mitchell moved the package from "no
place to another in the- stalls In a manner
that attracted the attention of the deputy,
who watched for developments, fully be
lieving that there was something crooked
going on. At last Mitchell wont up two
i [lights of stairs with the box, and a little
later Mr. Vogelsang hoard the Bound of
; hammering and the breaking of box
covers. The deputy slipped up after him
and found the salesman with the ducks
opened around him on the floor. Mitchell
offered no excuse for having the game in
his possession and submitted quietly to
'< arrejÃt. The ducks were expressed to
O'Brien & Spotomo from the San Joa
-1 qtiin Valley. Last year another game
dealer was arrested for a similar offense
and fined $100 In the Police Court, after
fighting the case to the end.
The Game Commissioners do not lay so
much blame for the violation of the law
upon the market hunters as they <in upon
i the. high-toned patrons of the first- lass
restaurants, where this kind of game finds
the greatest demand. This demand, they
contend, is what makes law-breakers of
the hunters and commission merchants,
as well as the keepers of the eating
houses mentioned. The game of the State
is growing more scarce every year, and
this may be attributed to a great extent
to the unlawful killing of young native
birds, which like the mallard and teal
breed here, to satisfy the appetites of a
number of moneyed nun who wish to
pose is epicures. The case against
Mitchell will come up in the Police Court
to-day, and it will be carefully watched
by the real sportsmen to s-e that thero
is no slip in the cogs of justice.

OREGON ANXIOUS

BRAVE SOLDIERS
Wants the Boys to
Return.
NINETY PER CENT WILLING
THEY WILL BE TAKEN NORTH
ON A SPECIAL TRAIN.
General Beebe's Efforts to Postpone
Mustering Out Not Likely to
Be SuccessfulâNebras
kans Are Next.
The question of whether or not the
Oregon volunteers will return to Port
land in regimental formation in order
that the citizens of Oregon may be af
forded an opportunity to tender them a
fitting welcome is practically settled. \
Lieutenant Colonel Yoran, chairman of
the committee appointed to ascertain the
wishes of the men in the matter, is of the ;
opinion that fully 90 per cent .of them |
will leave San Francisco in a body. Some i
of those who live along the line of the
railroad between this city and Portland
may not be able to resist the temptation |
to drop off at their old homes while pass
ing through, but Colonel Yorari is confi
dent a goodly number will go through to
â  the capital. If the regiment is mustered ,
; out in this city, according to orders issued
upon their arrival from the Philippines
by the War Department, on August 7,
they will start for Portland the next day
by special train. If the men elect, how
ever, they may yet be mustered out at
the place of enlistment. General Beebe
| of the Oregon National Guard has been
i untiring in his efforts toward this end
! and at his request General Shatter tele
\ graphed the War Department asking if
! >!.. regiment could be mustered out in
! Portland. The following answer to the
! telegram was received at army head
j quarters yesterday:
Replying to your telegram of yesterday con- i
! cernint- the muster out of the Oregon regiment
â¢ â¢ â¢ the case presents many embarrass
ments. The facts are these â¢ â¢ Â« The Sec
! retarj of War asked General Otis to ascertain ,
1 the desires of the [leers and men. It was |
reported that they unanimously desired to be
' mustered out at San Francisco, and the Secre- |
i tary of War so ordered Orders to nave the ;
! regiment mustered out in Sun Francisco will j
i stand unless the regiment by a major vote |
' should decide to y- mustered out at Vancouver
> Barracks. Many of the people ol the .-â  ite
! want the regiment to return as an organiza
â¢ tion In meeting the express wishes of th
, regiment already approved by the Secretary of
1 War this can be done only as the oincers and
i men agree to It. The law requires that arms
I and all property he turned In on mustering out.
The acting Secretary of War directs that â â " far
I as orders already given and the law and regu
lations will allow, you arrange to meet the
wishes of the people of the State as expressed
by General Beel .
H. C. CORBIN, Adjutant General.
It is hardly likely that the men will
vote to be mustered out In Portland, as
the chief reason for their desire to be
mustered out in San Francisco is that I
they may draw the thirty odd dollars
travel pay, which they will not receive
if they go to Portland before finally sev
ering their military allegiance to L'ncle
General Shatter yesterday called upon
Governor Poynter of Nebraska and Gov
ernor Tanner of Illinois. The Nebraska ,
volunteers are on the transport Hancock,
which 'is due to arrive any day. having
left Manila twenty-six days ago. Iho
State Board of Harbor Commissioners
has placed a tug at the disposal of the
i Nebraska executive and his party, and
as soon as the transport is sighted the â 
gubernatorial party will, start down the ;
bay to meet and welcome the volunteers. \
Congressman Kahn has charge of the ar
rangements for the trip.
Willie Burns wants to get to Manila.
â  His home is in New York City, but he
: made his way to San Francisco and
stowed away on the transport Zealani'ia j
when she sailed for the Philippines. ;
Willie was put off at Honolulu and sent |
back hen on the Australia. Since then |
he has been living with the soldiers at j
the Presidio. Wednesday he stowed him
self away on the Newport, but was dis
covered before sailing time and turned i
over to the police.
Parents and relatives of the returning
! California hoys have chartered the big j
: ferry steamer I'kiah and will go our to
welcome the soldier boys when the Sher
man arrives. Every tug and disengaged !
steamer on the bay has been chartered j
for that occasion, so it should be a gala
day on the bay.

promptly issued to them.
Due notice will be given, both by letter and

STREET OBSTRUCTORS
PUT UNDER ARREST
SOCIALIST ORATORS DRAW TOO
BIG A CROWD.
L;ist night a crowd gathered on Fifth
street, near Market, and several speakers
addressed them. The police had received
instructions to see thai pedestrians were
accorded a free passage, and when the
sidewalk became congested the crowd was !
asked to move on. Some refused and |
were promptly arrested for obstructing j
the street and refusing to move on. The \
arrival of ilit- patrol wagon on the scene j
attracted more people, and when the men
were hustled into the wagon by the offi
cers, the guardians of th<Â» peace were
ted with howls and other demonstra
tions "f disapproval.
After Joseph O'Brien, William Kdlin. O.
B. Benheim and Anthony McGinty had
been driven off in the wagon, Pauline
Eiorwitz, a woman 32 years of age. seized
an American flag and jumping on a chair,
began t" harangue the crowd, rfhe de
ed 'In- arrest of the m<-n as an out
rage, claiming that under the glorious
flag which she held in her hand every
citizen of the EJnited States was entitled
to the liberty of free speech. A police
man told her to desist, bur as his warn
ing was unheeded, he placed her under
arrest, and when the patrol wagon ar
rived she and Thomas Bersnrd were
driven to the City Prison. She clung to
the flag and it was taken from her in
prison.
The arrests continued, and when J. J.
Dunn was collared, Bessie Kifkin, a girl
25 â . â  ira of age and a native of Russia,
lumped on a chair and indignantly pro
claimed that the arrest of the men was
an outrage. She got no further, as Po
liceman Jordan laid his hand on her
shoulder and placed her under arrest.
She got a trip to the prison along with
Dunn and was placed in a cell with Miss
Horwitz.
(I. Hatch and Leon Deville were the
... m to take an enforced ride to the
prison, and after that the policemen suc
ceeded in dispersing the crowd.
The two women arrested seemed to
glory in their supposed martyrdom. They
said they were content to remain in their
cell all night for the good of the cause
, â¢ free speech and would comfort each
other Both said they had never at
tempted to address a public meeting be
fore but they actea on the Impulse ol
the moment, when they saw the men be
ing dragged off to prison.
The two women and four of the men
were later released on MO cash bail.

RUHLIN BESTS LAWLER.
DENVER, July 27.â Gus Ruhlin of
Akron, Ohio, got the decision over j
George Lawler of Milwaukee in the i
; ninth round before the Olympic Â«'lub
to-night after a very pnor exhibition !
so far as sparring was concerned. Law- !
ler'a ability to stand punishment was !
j the only creditable feature of the affair.
I Ruhlin forced the fighting from the
I beginning and seemed to land when- j
ever he wished when his arms were i
j free from Lawier's clinches.
In the first round both men began j
fouling with the first blow, and when
Lawler launched a vicious kick at his j
'. opponent there were loud demands for
the referee to stop the fight. "Bat"
.M.isterson, who was the referee, re
fused t" do this. He declared the crowd
i had paid its money to see a fight and
j the men should fight. In the second
round Lawler went down from a right
on the jaw and stayed down fully ten
seconds. Still the referee declined to
declare him cut. In the third round
' Ruhlin knocked his opponent through
1 the ropes.
Lawler made few attempts to land on
Ruhlin, but clinched and went to the
floor repeatedly to avoid punishment.
Ruhlin's blows landed oftenest on Law
ier's face and seemed to have little ef
fect. In the ninth round Lawler went
down several times to avoid punish
ment and finally the referee declared
him out, though his seconds protested
Vigorously, Lawler being on his feet a
Second later. There were demands for
another round, but Masterson said
"no."
The preliminary bout was between
Eueene Turner. Jack McKenna'a col
ored unknown, and Kid Brooks, both of
Denver. It was to have been a ten
| round contest, but Brooks' seconds
I threw up the sponge before the end of
the sixth round.

was the winner, and the fight was his
at any time lie wished to put Maynard
out. Maynard foughi under a great dis
advantage, bis opponent being about ten
pounds the heavier. Anthony's weight,
superior reach and height were used to
advantage, but he was very considerate
of his opponent, allowing several good
openings to pass when he could have se
verely punished Maynard. The latter' S
face was badly cut and he bled pro

Within the present year, almost for the first time, this j
monotony of degradation lias been broken. There
lias been some manifestation of effective public opin
ion, brought to bear directly upon the official service
and that has already produced appreciable result?.

should also accept nominations and scrutinize lists !
with the utmost '-arc. The;, should investigate the I
il and moral qualifications of possible can
ice and hold them up to the highest
; ird of capacity, of special fitness and of integrity.
If this advice proves acceptable, any conceivable boss
influence, on the Republican side at !ea>-t, will be
swept out of existence. LJndei our system of govern
ment absolute power resides in the people and for ail
the evils with which the country is infested they are
primarily responsible. If we have one municipal elec
tion, in which "very voter acts as an American citi
zen, there will be such an administration of local
affairs as will be permanently remembered and .1
precedent will be established from which it will be
difficult hereafter to depart.
Senator Stewart's plan of breaking Senatorial dead
locks by providing for election by a plurality vote
will be more satisfactory to the bosses than to the
people. A deadlock is not good, but it is better than
i -i open door to boodlers.
The report that General Alger has decided to keep
-ilent and make no attacks upon the administration
is an evidence that while the ex-Secretary has had his
head taken , off politically he hasn't lost it by any
means.
With all your attention in these days, attend to poli
tics. That's business.
EXPANSION fJND DESTINY.
THERE have recently been made public extracts
from a report and recommendations by Major
General Merritt. ma.de after a consultation with
the administration. a date in early June.
1808. They are the plainest evidence tffat a^rtrraT^O^
a policy of conquest and aggression had been de
cided upon. After giving an estimate of the troops
probably needed in the West Indies against Spain.
General Merritt recommended a large force; for
Manila, admitting it to 'be larger than seemed neces
sary to meet the Spanish there, by saying: "Before
we get through we will probably have to fight the
so-called insurgent?." â¢"Before we get through.
What?
The insurgents were not going to assist Spain. In
April. i8<)8, before Dewcy sailed from Hongkong to
fight the sea fight of Manila Bay, and after the Fili
pino treaty of alliance made by Consul Pratt at Singa
pore had been ratified by Dewey and Wildman at
Hongkong, the Filipino insurgent junta had issued
to their countrymen a proclamation in these terms:
"Compatriots: Divine Providence is about to place
independence within our reach and in a way the most
free and independent could hardly wish for. The
Americans, not from mercenary motives, but for the
sake of humanity and the lamentations of so many
persecuted people, have considered it opportune to
extend their protecting worth to our beloved couii;
try. At the present moment an American squadron
is preparing to sail for the Philippines. We. your
brothers, are very much afraid you may be induced
to fire upon the Americans. No, brothers, never
make this mistake. Rather blow your own brains
out than treat as enemies or fire a shot at those who
are your liberators. Take no notice of the Spanish
Governor General calling you to arms, although it
nay cost you your lives. Rather die than be ungrate
ful to our American liberators. The Governor Gen
eral calls you to arms! What for? To defend your
Spanish tyrants? To defend those that have despised
you. and even in public speeches asked for your ex
termination â those who have treated you little better
than savages? No, a thousand times no Take note
The Americans will attack by sea, and you must pre
vent any reinforcement- coming from Spain, there
fore we insurgents must attack by land. Where you
see the American flag (lying, there assemble in mini
mers: they are our redeemers." Much other matter
in the proclamation dwells upon the independence
and sell government assured to the Filipinos.
< in July 4, 1898, General Anderson addressed an
official letter to '"Senor Don Emilio Aguinaldo, com
manding the Philippine force-. Cavite, LuzonâGen
eral: f have the honor to inform you thai the United
StatÂ« - >f America, whose land forces 1 have the honor
to command in this vicinity, being at war with the
kingdom : tire sympathy and most
friendly sentiments for the native people of the Philip
pine Islands. For these reasons 1 desire to have the
ations with you. and to have you
and your people c< efate ivith us in the military
operations against the Spanish."
One of Dewey's officers, writing January 31, 1899,
ached Manila on May 20 of last
.; v. inch time there was no evidence, that we
â  , â  Tgai izatiorh He created an
army in a sh and immediately commenced to
win victories. The-- r< to us at the time astonish
ing, for he defi tachment after detachment of
the Spanish army, took fort after fort, captured regi
in - d ammunition and in a short time ;
had captured every Spanish soldier on the island of
Luzon. r>r had di ise not captured into Manila.
â  â ' -â  insurgents had actually cap
tured the whole of Luzon, excepting Manila, from the
Spaniards. After taking all of Luzon, with the ex
n? named, they conquered the Spanish in the
I^egros, and the city of Cebu. and before
iched Iloilo they had that city and the whole
island of Panay."
It i> evident, therefore, that in June, iBgB. there was
no danger of our having to fight the "so-called insur
gents" as the aiders of Spain, and Merritt meant by
th< phrase "before we get through" before we got
through wresting from our Filipino allies the islands
and cities which their valor had conquested from the
kingdom of Spain. It means, in fine, that somewhere
in the administration in Washington, in June. 1898.
it had been determined to hold the Philippine-, fir^t
the native- as our allies, under a promise of
independence, to conquer them from Spain, as they
did.
At that time the most generous emotions of the
American people were in action. On every face was
the Hush and in every heart the thrill of unselfish
sacrifice to make other people as free a? ourselves.
There was not among us a sign of any mercenary
motive! The chink of the dollar had not been heard.
President McKinley had officially denounced conquest
as "criminal aggression, opposed to our national code
of moral =." But at that very time, as proved by
Merritt's report, conquest had been determined upon
and the policy crystallized which political snivelers
now call "destiny." and blasphemous hypocrites say
i:, "the will of God." To do this the Filipinos were
betrayed by us and our own people were deceived by
their servants at Washington. Last year not a single
volunteer could have been had to cross the Pacific
for conquest. Instead of the fair boys, who brought
to camp on their faces the bloom of their country
homes, with lips consecrated by the farewell kiss of
mother- whose parting pain was ministered unto by
the thought that their sons would fall, if fall they
must, an unselfish sacrifice for the freedom of others,
we would have seen regiments of sullen conscripts
marched unwillingly to wage a war of greed against
the rights of man.
IMPROVEMENTS AROUND ThjE BflY.
REPORTS from San Jose are to the effect that
renewed efforts are being made to bring about
the construction of the long desired railway to
connect that city with Alviso. The movement gains
force from the fact that extensive improvements are
to be undertaken at Alviso which will add much to
its value and its convenience as a seaport uot only for
Santa Clara County, but for a wide region of country
south of it.
While the San Joseans are thus eager to improve
t!ie harbor in their vicinity, the people of Oakland
are exhibiting a spirit of similar enterprise. Resolu
tions introduced into the Common Council of that
city on Monday evening show an awakened sense of
the need of improvements along the water front and
give promise of the beginning of a movement that
will accomplish much in that direction.
The resolutions provide for the appointment of :â¦
committee to investigate the extent of th<?~ ownership
of the city in the land and waters lying between the
bulkhead and pierhead lir.es. as established by the
United States Government; to report an estimate of
the cost of construction of two piers to ship's chan
nel, each of which is to be 300 feet wide: and also to
report to the Council the proper proceedings to be
taken in order to acquire the right?, privileges and use
of these lands and waters and the investment of the
ownership forever in the people of the municipality.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JULY 28,, â *&>?'.
Undertakings of this nature along the bay may
! appear to some persons as portentous of injury to San
! Francisco. If good shipping facilities can be p' >
j vided at Oakland, at Alviso and at other points on
i the long line of the bay. there will grow up something
; of competition to this city, and that competition will
tÂ»sc&LU,:l<> such people to portend a loss of trade and
j of profit to the metropolis.
Such views can be entertained only by the Mort
sighted. The upbuilding of Brooklyn did not imrt
New York. Chicago was not injured by the rise of
i flourishing cities and towns around the lower end of
! Lake Michigan. Whatever improves the country
; around San Francisco Bay and builds up the commu
| nities that handle its traffic must advance the welfare
I of this city, provided our merchants are sufficiently
energetic to keep up with the march of improvement.
So far from regarding the enterprises oi Oakland
and San Jose with suspicion the people of this city
| should, as far as possible, co-operate with them and
! aid in their accomplishment. For the complete im
| provement of the various shipping point- around the
bay there will be needed large appropriations from
! the General Government To obtain them the people
| of- San Francisco ought to unite her influence with
that of the localities to be immediately benefited. San
* Francisco Bay is our bay and whatever improves any
part of it is of benefit to us.
POLICE RECOMMENDATIONS.
CHIEF OF POLICE LEES, in his annual re
port, urge- the importance of supplying the
police with a steam patrol boat for the water
front, bicycles for the use of a special squad, and
automobiles for use as patrol wagons. The steam
j atrol boat is declared to be "'imperatively necessary,"
while the bicycles and the automobiles are recom
mended in the interests of economy and efficiency.
Concerning the patrol boat, there is not likely to
be much, if any. controversy. San Francisco has
now become a large city. The water front covers
many milts, and the amount of property afloat upon
the bay is large. Police protection is needed there
as well as within the city, and it will be a false
economy that denies the money required to pro
vide it.
The suggested use of bicycles and automobiles will
meet the opposition of all who are by nature adverse
to the adoption of new methods of doing business.
Such persons will argue that as we have managed to
live in the past without those machines we can con
tinue to do so in the future. Progressive citizens,
however, will take a different view of the matter.
They will consider the suggestion upon its merits,
and if the innovation will increase the efficiency of the
service and tend to economy they will favor it.
If we may judge by the experience of other cities,
the benefit derived from bicycles and automobiles will
be large. A bicycle squad has been in the poiice ser
vice of New York and other Eastern cities for a long
time, and the advantage possessed by such squads
fcr patrolling parks and suburban di-tricts has been
frequently noted.
The automobile has been sufficiently tested to
demonstrate its worth. The postmaster at Buffalo
recently experimented with one in collecting mail
and found it enabled the mail carrier- having Jong
route- to accomplish their work in much les< time
than it could be done with a horse and cart.
It may be there will not be sufficient money in the
city treasury to defray the first cot of supplying the
new equipments. If such be the case, the improve
ments must of course wait It should be borne in
mind, however, that the cost of purchasing will be
about the only additional expense entailed. After
ward there will i>e a saving. As the Chief says in his
report, "there are at present in actual use in this de
partment nine patrol wagons, each of which is drawn
by two horses, with two relief horses to assist them.
It must be apparent at a glance what a drain the
keeping and care of the-e animals is upon the finances
of this department, and any measure which should
look reasonably and practically to the diminution of
this expenditure should. I submit, be regarded fa
vorably."
ThjE SOUTH AND THE CflNflL.
DESPITE the agricultural depression in the
Southern State- and the backward condition
of a large part of the rural districts, the South
ern people as a whole arc showing a considerable
appreciation of the prevailing prosperity of the coun
tr; at large and are rapidly becoming as enterprising
a- those of any other section.
The awakened business instincts of the South are
evinced in many ways. The e-tablishment of factories
and mills, the opening of mining industries and the
construction of railways have been accompanied by
certain developments in the domain of politics which
are not less conclusive of the change that has come
over Southern sentiment since the days when agricul
ture waÂ« regarded as the only industry worthy of a
gentleman.
Among these political developments are the revolt
against Bryanism on the part of the more influential
papers and leaders, and the increasing interest taken
in the construction of the Nicaragua canal. It is in
deed to the canal far-sighted Southerners look for a
general improvement of all the conditions of that sec
tion. They believe the canal will change the commer
cial conditions of the South and" give, it for the first
time an open way for expansion.
In a recent article on the subject the Louisville
Courier Journal said:
''The Gnlf of Mexico is now a dead eddy, is a
semi-tropic inland sea, with an imperfect outlet. The
Gulf States are in a pocket. Of the States upon the
Eastern seaboard of the United States they arc
farthest away from the, centers of trade and money
All efforts at direct communication between them and
FAtrope have been embarrassed by the increased dis
tance on the one hand and the dominancy of the great
Northern cities on the other. In that direction there
is no hope save that of fiscal and geographical de
pendency. As the map now is they will always have
to pay tribute to the shipowners and money-changers
of New York and its collateral branches, Philadelphia
and Boston."
The opening of the canal will change all these con
ditions. The Gulf of Mexico will be an open and
through it the ports of the South will have direct
communication with the Pacific Ocean and all the
rich countries that lie along it. So eager are the
Southerners now for the construction of the water
way some of them desire to set Bryan aside and the
free-silver plank with him. and to substitute in place
j of them a champion of the' canal with a platform
declaring its construction shall be undertaken at once
! and prosecuted with nil the energies of the republic.
Carnegie's offer to give San Diego $50,000 for a
library building provided the people guarantee to
I maintain it has of course been accepted with alacrity,
I and there are other cities would like Mr. Carnegie to
i know they are just as enterprising as San Diego.
When the California boys reach home we will have
a civic holiday and a general festival whether the
, Governor says so or not.
SALMON FISHING BY MACHINERY.
SALMON TRAP ON THE COLUMBIA RIVER.
THIS curious fishing wheel is used on the Columbia River, near Portland,
Or. It is fixed near the bank of the river, a place being- selected where
the river in most rapid. The wheel consists of three receivers, a? it were,
one of which is s.en fust leaving the water in the accompanying picture.
These receivers are inclosed on. three .-ides by wire netting, and. as th*
wheel revolves by means of the current, each receiver Is submerged beneath
the water and scoops up the salmon aa they jump up the rapids. The receiver
then continues on its upward journey, the salmon meanwhile slipping down
toward the axle of the wheel until at last, when it becomes perpendicular, the
fish is shot Into the wooden slide, which may be seen in the picture on the top
of the axle of the wheel. From this point it slips into the longer wooden slide.
and is hurled downward" into the boat seen in the bottom left-hand corner. There
are several of these wheels, which catch many thousands of salmon a day.

dentlj made by 006 who knew, hut she
mars' it.- beautiful harmonies when she

Mr. i ..ok has won his laurels in Napo

He wears them gracefull> and conscien

The other members of the company go
unobtrusively through their parts and
need no assistance from the prompter, but
this is the most that can be said. Except
in the prologue the stage settings are im
possible. The empire scenery i s "<* Btone

of empire furniture graces the room, not a
console table, not a mahogany piece with
its familiar brass trimmings, not a single
suggestion of the period. The empire was
a pseudo-classic revival and harkeii back
to the Caesars and to Greece, and is so
terribly familiar to us all that the anach

tion is reasserted. Other Federal and
State authorities are in complete agree
ment with said ruling.
Even where the accused has served a
term of imprisonment the Governor of
a State is competent to issue a pardon, no
matter how many years have elapsed.
This, too, may be news, perhaps. My
nephew is a very bright fellow, and he
could attain a high position in business
and political life were the Jean Valjean
doctrine to be inert as regards his amlii
tion and his prestige.
I contend, and I think every mature
lawyer will coincide, that an actionable
slander Is uttered every time any one
speaks of my nephew as an "ex-convict."
The moral harm of such a comment Is ob
vio.islv great and incurable. Therefore,
as tli" law cancels the crime where a
pardon has been granted by the chief
magistrate, it is the duty and it should
in- the policy of every police officer and of
every' citizen to say naught derogatory of
that person who has been so unfortunate
as to be convicted of a crime, but who
has been absolved by action of Governor
or Presldenut. C. A. HALPIN.

Joyce and Tessie Ike; German song,
Walter Arp; recitation, L,oveland Sawyer;
Cakewalk, Margie Flaherty and Gladys ;
Watson; sons. Mary Wolch. Will you
please put this in your paper, as some of
the children wanted it in the Examiner.,
and 1 take THe Call, and most all the
children want it in The Call and not in |
the Examiner? Other children might help
in the same way if they read about it.
If you can. will you, please? From a:
patriotic little girl.
FLORENCE DE GEAR,
123 Collingwood street, City.
The Call takes the greatest pleasure in
giving space to the above letter from Miss j
Florence de Gear. The medal fund for
the California volunteers, however, i.- be-
Ing raised by the Chronicle, and the
amount has therefore been remitted to :
that paper. The patriotic little ml.-* has I
pointed the way to many of her elders
who may have the inclination to add to
t: <* fund, but are at a loss how to pro
ceed.

Bunko Men Are Still Held on Charges
of Vagrancy. Which Will

, There was a comedy of errors in Judge
Mogan's court yesterday when the cases
of S. Evans, alias Neviils. Ben Franklin,
alias Hostetter, aid John I-.ee, alias Fos
ter, were called. They were charged with
vagrancy, and Franklin's case was â  . -- â 
called, but Prosecuting Attorney Joach
imsen mistook Lee for Franklin and the
case was almost concluded; when the mis
take was discovered, and the prosecuting
attorney asked Evans to stpp forward.
Before any evidence was rik^n. Evans
explained that he was not Franklin. A
search was then made for Franklin and
he was found dozing in the jury box.
"This seems to be a comedy of errors,"
said the Judge, "and I wish you would
bring Franklin to the dock, so that there
can be no mistake this tim*" Franklin
stepped into the dock and then Attorney
Mack asked that the thre* cases be con
tinued till Saturday arid they could be
gin all over again. The request was
The three defendants are all well-known
bunko men and were arrested in the sa
loon. 412 Kearny street, by Dt-teetive Dil
l.m and Policeman McGray for swindling
a stranger, Donald Leidigr. out of $M in
a dice game. When the case was called
before Judge Mogan Wednesday, the de
fendants having been charged with petty
larceny by trick and 'device; Leidig said
he would not sw>Â»ar to the complaint
charging trick and device, as he had lost
:he money; but could not say that it
was done by fraud in the shape- of loaded
dice; The" Judge accordingly dismissed
the case and a (.harge of vagrancy was
mad? against the men.
The police were dissatisfied with the ac
tion o: Judge Mogan. contending that he
should have heard the evidence and then
decided whether there was any trick or
device; and yesterday morning i_,ei<iig was
taken before Chief Lees, rie told the
story of how Franklin and Lee ap
proached him on Kearny street, asking
him to tell them where they could find
the subtreasÂ»ury ax.d finally landing him
in the saloon. wh>-re they were joined by
Evans, and the three started throwing
dice for drinks and then for money. Lei
dig refused at nrst to join in he game,
but was nnaliy induced to do so, and in
a few minutes lost $30.
The Chief was satisfied that a charge
of trick and device under section :Â«2 of
the Penal Code would stand and sent for
Prosecuting Attorney Carpenter of Judge
Treadwell's conrt. The facts were ex
plained to Carpenter and he' concurred
with the Chief and consented to 'issue the
complaints, in his court. Th.- complaints
were written out and Detective Dillon
went with Leidig to Judge Treadwell to
get them sworn to.
The Judge refused to sign the com
plaints on the ground that an officer of
his court had informed him that Judge
Mogai had already refused to issue the
complaints. Dillon asked the name of the
ofSrer of the court, but he did not give
it. Dilion alleges that the Judge's in
firrnaiJt was a man named Todd McDon
a''l who is credited wtih being an expert
dice thrower. So the matter stands at
present.

NEW fORK STOCK MARKET
NEW YORK. July 27.â The stock market
continued narrow nnd professional to-day until j
the last h.-.ur. when there developed m..re aiii- I
nation and strength lhan had been noted foh I
many days past. The late mo\.<nient seemed j
to star: with strength simultaneously displayed .
by Lake Erie and Western. Pittsburg C. C. and
St: Louis and Plttsburg rtnd Western preferred.:
-These stocks gained from \\ for L.ike Eric and
Western to 4 points for Pittsburg C. C. and i
Bu Louis. The marking ur> of sugar an extreme j
of 2 :^ and the rise in New York Central to |
110 helped on the movement and the general ;
market rose above last night's level. Unite !
an active demand sprang up for the grangers j
and lilted Burlington over a point. The activity
of the market did n<>t become general, how- j
ever, and gains were n<a uniform. The trader? |
wÂ»re bearish in the early part of the da but
finding lhai prices resisted pressure they turned
to the long side, encouraged by the strength
of special stocks. The movement in Rock
Island and the Southwestern stocks showed
pome diminution under profit taking, but Kan
sas and Texas preferred retained Its strength
and advanced over a point Sugar also showed j
an advancing tendency from the first, and .
Louisville and Nashville, which sold ex-divi
dend of 2 per cent, gained % of that amount j
There Â»a.< a midday advance in the tobacco j
stocks, which helped on the upward movement. ;
Continental common rising W and the pre- j
ferred and American Tobacco a point. Malt- '
ing stocks recovered smartly from yesterday' s ,
X'l-kes anil I.adede Gas jumped 3'-j DOints.
The developments in the money market l.pgan
with increased confidence. Yesterday and to
day there ha\e Leon large ins made on time
on' the Stock Exchange, from which it is
argued that operators feel the possibility of !
a demand for money that may stiffen call ;
rates and d-sire time loans on the securities
they Tire tryig to hold for a long pull. The I
.'act that the Bank of England did not increase
its discount rate to-day served to lessen ;
anxiety on the money question, and the weekly â¢
exhibit of thai institution showed that the |
open market had been able to reduce Its obliga- j
tions to the hank very heavily-. The sharp fall
in French rentes and reports of a political |
crisis in that country were without much effect j
in New York. The money tightness here was [
somewhat relieved by the transfer of funds !
from the sub-treasury to the banks on the
payment for ihe new custom-house site in
New York and it became known that the j
Government has cear^d for the time being Its
weekly withdrawal of deposits from the New
York banks, which have been at thÂ« rate of
$1,000,000 a week for some time past. June
statements of net earnings, completing the
flscnl year for a number of railroads, were
favorable factors, especially that of St. Paul.
snowing an increase In the net earnings for
th" year of $1,379,698
The bond market did not show much re
sponse to th<* strength in stocks and fractional
declines were the rule. Total sales, par value,
were $1,610,000. United States new 4 6 registered

I \v\ Guiln '' ln1 *-' Gloria are nOW
II A\ w husii:intl and %vife in the
<U> 4U !> compl^tvst meaning of that
relationship under the law. The hus
band has discarded his priestly garb;
has sacrificed the dignities of his tor
mer calling and has submitted to the
penalty of being known as an un
frocked priest. The wife, after years
of patient waiting and the suffering
th;.t shame and sneers bring, has been
rewarded by the public acknowledg
ment <'f her wifehood: The couple, were
married at 5:30 o'clock yesterday after
v.<>-<-.\ by Justice of the Peace John W.
Stetson in the apartments of the
woman.
The expose cf the relations existing
between the guilty priest and his par
ishioner created a sensation in Alameda
County. The affair was the theme of
widespread and incessant gossip, as
Father :Oloria had been widely known.
But with the marriage ceremony the
priest has disappeared in the man. The
Rev. Guilherme Gloria has become
plain William Gloria, with whose af
fairs the public have no â . :ern. He
and his wife will leave Oakland until
ill.- scandal of their union has become
an incident of forgotten history, and
then the husband will return to seek a
livelihood as best he may.
Early in the morning the news that
the clergyman had disgraced himself
and dishonored his calling was noised
up. in the streets. Father Gloria had
left the parochial residence in which
he had ruled so long. His trunk was
packed ar.d ready for removal at his
direction. lie was in the apartments of
his contract wife in the Davis block.
Father Pimental, the worthy pastor of
San Pablo", was in charge of the church
union Father Gloria had .-â¢> deeply in
jured. As far as the church was con
cerned the unfortunate affair was
ended. The church authorities will
strive with every energy to make
amends for the evil for which they
were not responsible and which they
could not prevent.
During the morning there was much
hurrying between the offices of Attor
ney E. M. Gibson and 'he rooms of
Miss Collins. The lawyer â¢ id acted as
the h-gal adviser of the woman for over
a year. Her brother and sister came
in from Haywards 10 consult with her.
Th- preparations for the marriage were
being mad-. Neither Father Gloria nor
Miss Collins could bo seen. They were
dumb to all interviewers; too much had
been said already of their affairs.

JOHN MOLL
SAYS HE HAD NO
LOVE FOR JANE
Answers Miss Hodge's
Damage Suit.
AVERS THAT SHE PROPOSED
HE HAD PROMISED ONLY TO
GIVE HER A HOME.
Daughters Objected and Threatened
to Leave Him Alone in His Old
Age if He Married the
Old Maid.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway. July 27.
John Nicholl, the aged millionaire of
East Oakland, familiarly known as the
'"Duke of Richmond," to-day riled answer
to the $50,000 damage suit brought by Miss
Jane Hodge for breach of promise, which
created so spicy a morsel for social gos
sips last January.
Never until to-day has the ancient mil
lionaire seen fit to divulge his side of the
episode that mad" Miss [lodge's cheeks of
50 summers glow with tenderest love.
John Nlcholl's story differs materially
in the main incidents and circumstances
surrounding the proposal, and although
there is obviously an admission made
that there was a proposal, the making of
such is attributed wholly to the suing
lady, and the question of feeling and af
fection usually indispensable in affairs
d'amour apparently never reached a
higher degree of temperature than zero.
Mr. Nicholas answer drawn up by his
attorneys, J. B. Mhoon and Sam Bell Me-
Kee, after generally denying that de
fendant on November 10. 1898, or at any
time, promised to marry Miss Jane Hodge,
leads off with the following Interesting
allegations, in explaining what did take
place:
And in this behalf the defendant alleges
that he Is 7*> years of asre. and a widower;
that he has nine children, two of whom, to
wit, Mary and Hester Xicholl, are unmar
rlod elrls of lawful age. who live with and
keep the home for and are dependent for
maintenance upon this defendant. That on
or about the time and the place mentioned
in salJ complaint the plaintiff, wlÂ»o Is a
niece of defendants by affinity, was living
with and dependent upon the defendant's
deceased wife's sister. Mrs. R. A. Boyd,
for a home and maintenance; that on Bald
day, to wit, November I<\ 1898 in aecord
ani-e with a long-established and friendly
family relation, and also pursuant to the
business necessities of the said Mrs. B. A.
Boyd, this defendant proceeded in his
buggy to thÂ» said Mrs. Boyd'a house, and
after dispatching his business with Mrs.
Boyd asked the plaintiff to take a drive,
with him; that the plaintiff accepted the
defendant's Invitation to drive as aforesaid,
and while on said drive defendant fell to
talking with the plaintiff about the fart
that he was old and dependent upon his
said daughters. Mary and Hester Nl.choll,
'or society and care, and defendant further
said to said ;,lalntiff that the necessity of
car . . for this defendant deprived his said
f daughters of all opportunity to go out of
evenings and enjoying social life appro
priate to their years. Thereupon plaintiff
said she wi'Uld like to come over to defend
ant's house and get a home there, and that
she (the plaintiff) would make it pleasant
for the defendant and his daughters. To
this offer li.- defendant replied that his
daughters, Mary and Hester, might not
like the arrangement, and thereupon the
plaintiff said that she would get their con
sent to that arrangement, and she further
said that if they made ny objection she
would not force herself upon them and the
plan of marriage with defendant should be
dropped then and there To this proposi
tion *s<> mad" by the plaintiff to the de
fendant the defendant agreed, and there
in -on promised to marry the plaintiff if she
could and would get his daughters to agree
1 and consent to said marriage between plain
tiff and defendant, and not otherwise.
The answer then recites the unsuccess
ful efforts of Miss Hedge to get the
daughters' consent, although aided in her
efforts by defendant, and alleges the
failure of this essential condition prece-
Defendant further avers:
That the said Mary and Hester Kicholl
object to the marriage b'twwn th* plain
tiff and defendant and threaten to leave him
Âi Ââ in hla old age If he marries plain
tiff nnd plaintiff is harassing and threatens
to continue issing this defendant for the
few years he can hope to live and to he re
vene ; upon him if his said daughters do
not consent to his Bald marriage with her.
\nd in this 'behalf defendant alleges that
no question of feeling or affection entered
Into the proposed marriage between plain
tiff and defendant, but the entire arrange
ment was proposed for the purpose of se
curing a home for plaintiff and a house
keeper for the defendant without scandal.
Defendant also alleges that prior to the
commencement of this suit plaintiff with
drew her promise to marry the defendant
and expressly released defendant from his
said promise to marry her. In conclusion
,l. â â â 'ant denies that Miss Hodge has suf
ere at all In body or mind on acount of
his refusal to marry her, or that her pride
was thereby greatly wounded, wherefore
Mr. Nicholl prays to be dismissed with his
costs. _^^__

Trouble is brewing In Peralta School
District over the ownership of the old
schoolhouse which lies In that portion of
the district which was annexed to Oak
: land two years ago. There is strong talk
among the property owners in the dis
trict cf preventing the city authorities
from taking possession of the building
! when school opens next Monday. Action
on the pai I â¢ I the School frusteea of the
district is awaiting th< outcome of the
meeting of the Oakland Board of Educa
tion to-morrow night, when that body will
be asked to declare Itself.
Not lime since the Board of Trustees
notified t 1 t Education that the
1 Peralta rich"..! District laid claim to all
: the personal property contained in the
building. This personal property consists
of books, maps, charts and a piano. The
Trustees were ordered to investigate the
Question ol the ownership of the realty.
this Instruction being in strict conformity
to a notice seni the Oakland Hoard of
Education ovc i a year ago saying that it
! the Trustees of the district ever claimed
any of the real property they would not
stop short of claiming it all.
Padlocks on the door of the schoolhruse
on Monday morning next, with determined
men to preveni the city authorities from
beginning the fall term of studies within
its walls is not a pleasant outlook for the
City Superintendent of Schools. While
he is In hopes of matters reaching an
amicable settlement. he admits that
things look serious. Hence the meeting of
the local board to-morrow night. It is
understood that at this meeting a large
Ltion of interested residents of the
Peralta district will be on hand to state
! their cas< and insist on the recognition
' of their claims to the building, which the
lays came to it with the annexation
! of that territory.
In -peaking nf the situation. Professor
<;. irge Colby of the State University, one
of the three Trustees on the district
board says that while matters are indeed
serious he will endeavor to exhaust every
means of reaching a peaceable settlement
bÂ«-for" resorting to the courts with any
injunction proceedings.
"As a board." said I'rofessor Colby,
"we have taken no action In the premises.
We shall await the outcome of to-morrow
evening's meeting of the Oakland Board
nf Education before making any move to
ward forcing our rights. I am not a
lawyer and really do not know exactly
what those rights are, but a great many
people in our district claim that as long
as Peralta School District exists the
schoohouse belongs to it and not to the
city of Oakland. Further than this I do
not care to speak."
In spite of this claim, however, the rem
nant of the old district has let the con
tract for the construction of a pretty, new
Bchool building to be erected in Clare-
morn.
<>n several previous occasions Peralta
i District has come Into prominence
:se of trouble with its Board of Trus
â  vei the teachers employed there.
About twelve months ago the strange
spectacle ->f a teacher Instructing a score
or more of pupils in a tent was presented
because of a difference between members
of the board over what teacher should be
employed. More recently Trustee Allison
became conspicuous because ..f a jocular
â¢â¢ wrote to an applicant, giving- her
some facetious Instructions about being
good-looking and duly attentive to the
Trustees.
MET HIS DEATH IN
THE YUKON'S WATERS
CAPT. DOUGLAS BARNES LOST
NEAR RAMPART CITY.
Served as a Member of the Oakland
City Council and Represented So
lano in the Legislature.
ALAMEDA. July 27.â Captain Douglas
G. Burnt s of 637 Taylor avenue is sup
posed to have lost his life in the Yukon
on June 10. He was a member of the
Leonard party, which wintered at Ham
pan City. Up had withstood the rigors of
the Alaskan climate better than the young
men of the party, although he was nearly
74 years old.
Captain Barnes had occupied much of
his time during the winter building a
small sailing: boat, and it was while tak
ing a pleasure trip In the craft that he is
supposed to have perished. After he had
cruised about for some time his friends
on shore saw his boat whirl around in a
manner that indicated plainly that the
craft had been caught in one of the
treacherous whirlpools of the Yukon. The
boat capsized and in a few minutes was
carried out of sight by the swift current
below a group or islands. Next day the
boat was found stranded on the shores of
the river twenty rallea from where it had
capsized. There is a possibility that Cap
tain Barnes saved himsi if and made his
way to some camp remote from communi
cation with members of his. party. An
Indian reported that he saw him clinging
to the bottom of the boat as it disap
peared among the islands.
Captain Barnea was a native of Â»w
fork, and would have been 74 years old
next Tuesday. He came to California in
1549. He established the first planing mill
in Oakland in l y ".S and in the early sixties
was a member of the Council of that city.
Later he represented Solano County in
the Legislature for three terms, fie came
tO Alameda eight years ago and lived here
until he went to the Klondike. He was
a prominent member of the Encinal Yacht
Club and was a skillful sailor. Mrs.
Barnea still resides In this city. Harry
Barnes, a son. is in the employ of the
Southern Pacific Company.

! Blood Poisoning Set In From Ulcer
ated Teeth and the Doctor Plead
ed With Tearful Eyes
Not to Be Exposed.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, July 27.
The seven-year-old son of Mrs. John
Martin of Twenty-first street has been
saved from a horrible death by blood pois
oning:. For nearly a week he was treated
for mumps by a young physician, when in
reality he was suffering with ulcerated
teeth. At one time Mrs. Martin had prac
tically given up all hope of paving her
chiia, who is the light of her household
and a general favorite with all her
friends, but owing to the quick work of
Dr. E. H. Woolsey the lad's life was
spared.
A week ago Sunday little John was
taken sick with a swelling in his face.
Mrs. Martin called In a young physician,
whose name she has divulged to no one,
and was told that it was a case of mumps.
On Friday she discovered an abscess
about to break on her child's neck. She.
was horrified by the thought that perhaps
little John would be scarred for the rest
of his days, or what was worse, be taken
off after a period of terrible Buffering.
When she saw that the first diagnosis
of her boy's case was incorrect Mrs. Mar
tin dismissed her young doctor after he
had pleaded, so she says, with tears in
his eves not to be exposed, and sent ror
Dr Woolsey, who declared her suspicions
of blood poisoning were correct. An ex
amination of the child's mouth disclosed
three ulcerated teeth. Without an hour
delay these were taken out and the boy
dosed with liberal draughts of whisky
and port wine to fortify his blood.
After being in attendance on her child
for five days and nights without taking
any sleep Mrs. Martin was rewarded by
seeing her son steadily Improve till to
day he was pronounced out of danger and
permitted to go out of the house for a
little while. Â Â
"He had an awfully close call, said
Mrs. Martin in speaking of her boy. It
'â  I had not known a little bit about such
matters that young physician whom I
called in first would have doctored the
1 child into his grave. He is well out of
danger now and 1 shall not be robbed of
my dearest treasure."
Joseph Smith Drowned.
The body of a man. probably
a mulatto, was found floating in the bay
yesterday morning near the bulkhead oft

Inches tall, with black curly hair. The

SHE PREFERRED DEATH
TO A RECONCILIATION
MRS. JOHN H. JONES DRANK
CARBOLIC ACID.
Had Trouble With Her Husband,
Who Is the Weil-Known Cuban
Agitator and Insurance
Man.
Mrs. John H. Jones committed suicide
last evening at her residence, 2006 Mason
street, by drinking carbolic acid. The
woman had just returned to her husband
after a separation of one week, and was
preparing to indulge in a feast which had
been prepared in honor of her homecom
ing when she gulped down the contents of
a two-ounce bottle of the deadly fluid, and
staggering into the kitchen of the flat
which they occupied fell unconscious to
the floor. All medical assistance proved
futile and she died in terrible agony a
short time afterward.
The woman's motive for her rash act
was the old story of domestic infelicity.
She married John H. Jones six years ago
at the age of IS years. Jones was em
ployed by the Boston Fire Insurance
Company. Trouble between the two com
menced shortly after their marriage, and
according to statements made by tne
woman to her father, W. R. Games life
became unbearable to her and caused her
to harbor the thought of suicide. One
week ago, it is said, her husband choked
her and she left her home and went to
stop with Miss Vera Gonzolas, who lives
at the Silver State House, IS Mason
street. After she had gone every effort
was made to induce her to return. At
first she was obdurate, but finally heeded
the pleadings of her husband and her
father and consented to return in time for
dinner last night.
The husband, in anticipation of the re
union, had a dainty meal prepared. Seven
o'clock was the hour set for its consum
mation. Scarcely had the clock struck
that hour when he was startled to see his
wife stagger into the kitchen and with a
Piercing shriek fall to the lloor. Picking
her up, he found that she had taken car
bolic acid with the intention of ending
her life. Two physicians were called, but
could do little for the patient. Finally
Dr. W. D. Clark of 819 Filbert street ar
rived, but he could do as little as the
others. The woman lingered until about
10 o'clock, when she died in terrible agony.
â When the husband found that his wife
had swallowed the poison he fell into
hysterics, and when the physicians ar
rived they were obliged to put him to
sleep by means of drugs. Deputies I. a
Combe and Flannigan of the Morgue took
charge of the remains. They obtained
statements from the father of the un
fortunate woman and from neighbors
touching upon the trouble which existed
between the man and his wife. In many
conversations Mrs. Jones had threatened
to kill herself, and those who are inti
mate with her are not surprised at the
act. Jones could not be wakened and he
was left in charge of two police officers,
Who will question him on the cause or
his wife's death as soon as he becomes
conscious. On a table in the room occu
pied by the woman was found the follow
ing note, unaddressed and unsigned:
I can't stand It any longer. Forgive mi> and
think kin.lly of me. Mamma wants me an.l
I am. going hump tn her. Look Bfter Rollie
mi.! toll him to pray for his unfortunate
auntie
Mrs. Jones was the wife of a well-known
member of the Cuban society !n this city.
She was im years of age and was very
good locking. She was highly educated,
having graduated from a convent shortly
her marriage.
ENTERTAINMENT IN
ST. BRENDAN'S PARISH
Creditable and Successful Exhibition
Last Night to Help Clear the
Parish Debt.
The ladies in charge nf the Sacred
Heart booth of St. Brendan's church fair
gave a delightful entertainment last even
ing in the parish hall on Harrison ami
Fremont streets to help the preliminary
funci for the fair, which is to be held in
September.
The programme was a long and an in
terestlng one The hall was crowded.

Mrs. McGlade, Professor F. L. Miller,
Harry W I Brown, P. Yale, Miss Ade
line *K. Birebler, Miss Loretto Hickey,
Miss Vivie Hickey, Herbert Ely, Orpheus

ELEVATOR OPERATOR
BLAMED FOR A DEATH
HE DID NOT EXERCISE DUE
DILIGENCE.
An Ordinance Requested Requiring
Elevator Doors to Be KÂ°pt
Closed While in Mo:::-
Coroner Hill held an. inquest yesterday
I upon the body of Georg-e Schade, the M
year-ol<i newsboy who was killed last
Tuesday morning by fallinar from a pas
senger elevator cajre in the Mills build
in?: from the eighth, fioor to the base
- --â 
Operator Clarence Johnson told the Jury
: how the boy happened to fa!! out of the
ca?e. He said that Ralpfc Kenrici got aut
at the eighth floor and the newsboy was
looking in the mirror. After the case had
risen about four feet on its way to the
ninth fioor the boy rushed to the door and
causrht hold of the iron grillwork. The
door was open about six inches, and as
the ca?e went up Schade's body was
eaueht between the elevator ami the side
of the well and wi< rolled and crushed
until it dropped to the basement.
The jury rendered a verdict that Scha.de
came to his d-ath from Injuries resulting'
from the fall? and the following is added:
"And we do further find that the oper
ator running the elevator did not exercise

requiring the doors of elevators to be
closed after the elevators are started."

HOW THEY WON
THE CONVENTION
FOR CALIFORNIA
Rev. T. Fiiben Home
From the East.
"TO CALIFORNIA IN 1901"
â â¦ â â
THE CRY THAT CAUGHT THE
EPWORTH LEAGT/EBS.
Great Enthusiasm Over the Prospec
tive Trip to the Golden West.
Lo= Angeles Joined.
Hands for This City.
Rev. Thomas Fi!t*en arrived from la
dianapotls !ast evercir.sr. He 5 the first
of the California defegation to return Jrctn
the Epworth League convention, and he
brings the first complete story of how San
Francisco fought for the honor of the next
convention and how it was woo.
"Vt'ft went to- work in typical California
fashion," said Mr. Fllben. is lie settled
himself in a chair to teli his story. "We
had the fi?ht won before the matter of
choosing a p!ace for the next convention
went to the committee, and then all the
committee could do was to foliew the
wishes ofthe m^m'&ers of the convention.
Every one was w^arin? one of our badges
acd every one was raising the cry 'Cali
fotrtia in V*.<l.' The verdict of the commit
tee was unanimous, but a straw ballot be
fore the committee met rave San Fran
cisco six. -Los Angeles three and Denver
"Our proposition wii this: to pr>i%-ide
bousing tor SjEMO pecjpie in thre^ hatls,
wicli ei^hr additional auditoriums for the
business of the convention; to provi.Je ac
commodation* for li.!>*> at *1 a day and
for HMKW more at J2 a day and upward: to
secure a railroad race that would be sat
isfactory to ever;- one. and one that would
place "he trip wichin tlie reach of all: to
on â t all expends of the convention and
the programme up to S2SJ9QQ. We had t^n
tons of property with us. which Included
!t>.':-Â«Â» posters. rj.:sÂ«Â» badges; a stereopticon
ou:rit" with 2&) slides showing the finest
Callfarnfan scener>-. plenty of fresh fruit
and literature enoug-h to keep every one
*upplie4. We captured the town, and
every time the name "California 1 was men
tioned from the platform it was greeted
with cheers.
"We Â»>r<r not much handicapped by the
rival claims of Los Angeles. We fixed
all that before we l^ft here. As soon as
Lo* Angeles app^ar^i as a competitor for
the convention we dxew up an agreement
with the delteition from there tha" wii^n
we went before the convention at India
napolis we sh'>uld unite on the cry 'Cali
fornia In &&.' We carried this ag-reeinent
out to the Letter. All our stationery hid
the names of both the Los Angeles and
the SaiT" Francisco committees and a-i
worked for the State. At the last mo
ment the committee decided to hear offers
from cities not from States, and then the
two delegations fought for th^ir own
places. I had never a doubt, however, as
to the result- This is the logical ptace.
"The San Francisco delegation wiis.
mad- up of E>r. W. W. Case of San Fran
cisco Dr. J. N. Beard of San Francisco,
W K. Waste of Oakland. T. B. Hutchin
son of Napa. Harry Morten of San Jos
and myself, who went to Indianapolis,
and Robert Husband. Miss S. E. Powell
and C. B. Perkins. We intend to con
tinue the organization of the committee
and start the" work of preparation at poceJ
Miss Powelt is secretary of the commit
tee. Mr. Husband treasurer and I am
chairman. We will utilize the organiza
tion of the church to form committees all
through the Union, and I am sure when
the time comes we will have the largest
religious gathering that has ever con.
vened in this country- We must make
good oar guarantees by October 15. I:< 00:
the convention will open in July of DOL
It is fitting that the opening rear of the
new century s-couid b<e marked by such
a great religious gathering as will be here;
It: mast be an event that will not soon be
forgotten.** _____________^_

PROCEEDINGS FOR THE
EXTRADITION OF KEETOS
It Is Expected He Will Be Given Over
to Texas Authorities
To-Day.
AUSTIN. Fair in.â ln the negotiations
pending between the Texas authorities
a.nd the Mexican Gornnmeot for the ex
tradition of John Keeton. now- fen jail ac
Jaurez. Mexico, and wan;;-! in Coteman
County. Texas, to answer to the charge
of train robbery, the o.uestion of the crima
having been committed before the present
treaty became eff-etive has not been
raised.
Th-Â» only- objection to the extradition.
!)i Ke<=ton" yet urge! by the Mexican au
thorities la that the existing- treaty doe 3
not provide for the extradition of prison
ers charged with t-eins: accomplices la
crime. This point will probably be waived
In vi-w of the fact that certified copies- of
the-record showing the conviction of
Keeton's accomplices and his connection
with the erirnr have been furnished th*
Mexican authorities at their request. Th^s
application for the prisoner* extradition,
i-.h the charse of sheep-stealing has beÂ»a
cade aa a last resort should the first ap
plication fee refused. It is expected that
Keetfrn will be turned over to the Texa*
authorities to-morrow.
It is claimed by the Texas authorities
that the questions fn/rotved in th? Ketton
oas* are nothing like as intricate as those
in. the case> of Mrs. Rich, who was re
cently turned over to th- 5 Mexican au
thorities to answer to :he charge of kill
ing her husband. Fn the latter case the
shooting was done in Juarez. Mexico, but
the wounded man died on this side of the
border. The fact is also cited that th*
United States Government waived some
enuaUv intricate points in zrantin? th~
extradition of Santiago Morphy. who was
arrP sted ir. Kaa.-as City a short time a?o
and turned over to the Mexican, authori
ties for embezz'em-jit in the City of
Mexico. Should the Mexican Gorernment
refuse to grant Keeton'? extradition on
technical around*, ivich action vv-u'd tend
to discourage the efforts of the officers of,
the law who are endeavoring to suppress
crime along the P.:o Grande border.

THE TRAIL OF A SACK
AGITATES THE PUSH
Buckley Lambs Line Up Against
Rainey=Examiner League.
Signs of a Fierce Battle for Control of the Demo=
cratic Convention â Rounders and Heelers of
the Factions May Clash at the Polls.
I I EELERS of the Rainey-Exam- j
I [ni r combine, followers of buck
i[\ ley ami tht apostles of Jasper
1 McDonald's Reform Democracj
Â§ -wen- agitated yesterday morn-
Ing by a rumor that the Phelan
pack was open. Early in the day the
report was received that th-- sack was
in sight in the Fortieth District -from
Fillmore street to the Richmond Dis
trict. M. C. Hassett was accredited
with th<- distinction which attaches to
the position of disbursing agent.
Demi" rats eager to ascertain if the
Ftory of a loosening up was true pro
ceeded ai once to investigate. Diligent |
inquiry at the saloons in the Fortieth
District disclosed the fan thai only i- ,
had been disbursed by Mr. Hassett,
â  irther that the money was ex
pended in a purely legitimate, social '
tour of the neighborhood. Later In the
ci atic circles were excited by
r rumor that an ag< nt of Phelan
had opened a sack in the Murphy build
the name of the disbursing
;;_. nr was not given out.
All the signs point to a vigorous fight
on primary election day, Augusi 8. for
sslon of the Democratic works. In
if the districts the heelers of the
y-Examiner crowd may collide
with Buckley rounders. The Â£><>Â«i citi
zens of San Francisco should n<> 'â¢> the
polls as early in the day as possible to
avoid sight of the scrimmages which
c; the Di mocratic fac
tions. The Examiner understands that
v. as the leader of the Fire De
partment, is a handy man around a
â  box. He gained so much notori
â  ars ago for skill in stuffing
ballot boxes, that the Examiner, in 1894, '
cartooned him as a customer in the
Taxidermist shop of D. M. Hums.

aie deeply incensed at the course of the
Examiner in defaming every Democrat
that refuses to accept Rainey as a boss.
The officers <>f the executive commit
tee of Jasper McDonald's faction of the
Democratic party disclaim all responsi
bility for the mass meeting which will
take place ai Metropolitan Temple to
morrow nisrht. At Buckley headquar
ters the statement is made that the
Buckleyites did not call the meeting.
The Bulletin asserts that the Demo
cratic Central Club, which planned the
meeting, i.s a Buckley organization in
disguise. Last week the Examiner
gave the proposed meeting a half-col
umn of free advertising, but now the
paper is silent. The officers of the
Democratic Central Club are:
Charles (i. Holcomb, past president;
Oscar H.H-ks. president; William Fahey,
first vice president; J. I>. Powers, second
resident; James J. Maher, recording

The assertion was mad.- yesterday by
an officer of the executive committee
of One Hundred, that the Examiner
was deceived last week when it pub
lished the call for the mass meeting,
under the auspices of the Democrati â 
Central Clubâ that the paper was not
then informed as to the true charactei
of the dub.
Th mmittee of One Hundred has
derived authority from the Demo<
State Central Committee, to hold a
mass meeting at Metropolitan Temple.
Friday evei ext week. At th it
time Phelan and Dodge will be appro
priated exclusively to the McDonald-
McNab Democracy.
[ndependent spectators of the Dem- J
ocratic factional fight express the judg
ment that the Buckley faction will
a greater number of delegates to the
â  ntion than will either of the other
factions, but not a sufficient n
swing the convention against a com
bination of the Raine.y-Examini
and the McDonald-McNabites. Demo
crats anticipate that Rainey, backed by
the Examiner, will begin a campaign
of bulldozing as scon as the delegates
hosen. Every effort known to
rough politics will be invoked to force
the Rainey- Examiner slate on the con
vention. Already hints are thrown :
out that Phelan will not accept a nomi
nation from the convention controlled
bj Buckley. Phelan is to be used as a
dub to whack ever: into line
for the Rainey-Examiner slate.

Republicans who desire that good gov

th( meetings this evening in their respec
tive districts and resist any attempt of
bosses, big or little, t.i dictate Ihe elec
tion of delegates to the Advisory Central
Club. The prospects for Republican suc
cess were never brighter. Yet Heoub
licans will fall short of their duty if they
remain at home and permit the politi
cians of the professional type to run the
district meetings.
Word comes from every district that
the names of the best citizens will be put
on the ticket as delegates for the forth
coming Republican municipal nominating
convention. The delegates to be chosen
this evening for the Centra) Advisory
Club should not be confused with dele
gates for the nominating convention. In
due time nominations for delegates to the

to listen to the hursis of eloquence which
had been promised In the Invitations. The
principal speakers were A. B. Morgan, 1!.
I Mulcreavy. .J<>bn J. Barrett and Henry
Hogan. With the exception of the latter
speakers confined their xetnarks to
usual denunciations of RÂ«publicans and
Republican institutions and praise for the
Democrats. Hogan created quite a sen
sation by a lurid attack on the news
; papers of San'-Franefsco for what he
termed their unjustified roasts of Chris
! Buckley. He declared the blind ex-boss
to be a ram h-abused man and Indulged In
.: argument to prove the truth of his
assertion and also to show that the papers
were the real offenders against public
murals and political decency. Buckley's
following in the audience vigorously ap
plauded Hogan's defense of ;h-ir leader.

EXAMINER'S CHARITY
EXCITES DERISION
Its Wagonload of Overcoats for
Oregon Volunteers a Myth.
Only Eight of the Fifty-Five Loaned the Paper by
General Warfield Materialize at the Camp
of the Philippine Veterans.
/HAT has become of the "wagon
-1 I /load" or overcoats borrowed by
111 the Examiner from General War
*^^ field of the Second Brigade to be
loaned to the Oregon volunteers
now encamped at the Presidio waiting to
be mustered out of the service of Uncle
Sam? The effusive self-praise with which
the yellow journal called the attention of
a wondering public to Its unparalleled
"generosity" when it announced that it
had made arrangements to clothe the re
turned veterans, whom it pictured as
shivering with cold in the fogs of San
Francisco and in danger of being obliter
ated from the earth by an epidemic of
pneumonia, caused the unthinking or un
informed reader to believe that it really
contemplated doing something.
Those who had been informed and who
had been made familiar by long acquaint
ance with the Examiner's hypocritical
stations of benevolent charity knew
the whole outburst of pretended pity and
compassion for the alleged sufferings of
the Oregon volunteers was simply another
disgusting effort on "the part of the dis
credited sheet to obtain a little free ad
vertising at the expense of the veteran
soldiers, whom it persisted in favoring
with Jts condescending patronage and
commiseration. The majority of the read
ers of San Francisco, accustomed to the
vagaries of the Examiner habit
miseration. The majority of the read
of San Francisco, accustomed to the
iries of the Examiner and its habit
of grasping every opportunity to adver
tise itself at the expense of anybody and
everybody when it could do so without
cost to itself, did not trouble themselves
with worrying over the problem of
whether the paper would carry out its
self-imposed duty and clothe the soldiers
it had taken under its protecting wing
with so much blowing of horns. They
realized that, having expended several
days and considerable ink and paper in
heaping praises on itself for what it an
nounced it intended to do for the poor
soldiers, the Examiner would quietly let
the matter drop before unlooked-for ex
pense might possibly be incurred.
That "wagonload" of coats for the Ore
gon volunteers has never materialized at
the camp of the Oregonians. and the en
tire expense the Examiner has been put
to up to date in connection with this mat
ter is the hiring of a dray to haul a few
dingy, wornout blankets and eight bor
rowed overcoats, four of which were with
out capes, to the "Presidio.
The Examiner secured fifty-five over-
I coats the property of the National Guard,
1 from General Warfleld, but only the frag
â  ments of eight of them were received by
the Oregon regiment. General Warfleld
holds a receipt showing that the fifty-five
I were delivered to the Examiner; and Lieu
tenant Knapp, quartermaster of the Ore
eon regiment, declares but eight were re
ceived The record kept by Regimental
Quartermaster Sergeant C. Ritterspacher,
who receipted for the coats at the camp,
confirms the statement of Lieutenant
Knapp. This all happened a week ago,
a recital of the good work contemplated
during the campaign.
Phelan was the th.-me on which the
orators talked. Colonel Barry and < litua
Barbour delivered addresses which
evoked much applause. The speeches were
mainly euloglsms of Phelan.

A BRUTAL OUTRAGE
BY A JAPANESE
KNOCKS OUT A BOY'to EYE WITH
THE POINT OF HIS CANE.
The Boy Is the Son of Charles P. Troy,

Sheriff, Hying at 34 Octavia street, yes
; terday afternoon.
.The boy has lost the sipht of one eye
and may" lose the sight of the other.
The boy was ridins on his bicycle along
Octavia street, and as he was crossing
Gough he brushed pas( a Japanese. The
Japanese was apparently, scared and up
lifted a cane he carried as If to strike
the boy. , _. .
Young Troy dismounted and grabbed
hoia of a rock to defend himself, when
the Japanese mad.- a thrust with the cane
at his face, and the point struck the boy
full In the right eye. The pain was In
tense and the boy was for the moment
blinded and was unable to see where his
' assailant had pone, but three young ladies
â  who saw the assault told the boy that
he had disappeared in the Japanese mis
on school on Haight street, near Oc
tavia. ' . .
The boy stop i his way home and his
mother at once summoned a physician,
who tour.d that the sigh* of the eye was
completely destroyed -and he had grave
[ fears that the boy might lose the sight

Knapp expressed the sentiments of nearly
ail the officers and privates 1 when he de
clared that he wished the Examiner had
kf-m its eight overcoats and the dingy

forced to receive.
â¢â¢There is no necessity whatever for all
this fuss about overcoats," said Ldeuten
ani Knapp yesterday. "We have plenty
of them in store and the men could have
them for the asking. Of course, they
would have to pay for them, bui it would
come out of their dpthlng allowance. If
they prefer to do without the coats isi

"The fact is. General Shatter has .
permission for the soldiers to purchase
civilian overcoats, and therefore they have

they cannot claim that they are prohib

No one at the camp will undertake to

Examiner for their use. but which are
being- held back by the self-appointed dis

The Oregon volunteers are not suffering

and they are altogether too manly a set
of men 'to relish the idea of being pub
