BRITONS ANXIOUS FOR
WAR AGAINST THE BOERS
T OX DOW Aug. 12.â The
Â£^j very deep interest mani
fested here in the court
itdl of Captain Dreyfus and the
indignation ill England feels that
he should be subjected to another
and unnecessary tedious trial have
been almost lost sight of during the
last day or two in a revival of the
H'ar fcz'er over the Transvaal.
When Mr. Chamberlain pro
posed a joint inquiry the trouble was
looked upon^ as settled, but the re
port that the Transvaal Govern
ment had refused to join in such an
inquiry has created not only ex
citement but intense surprise.
Even those papers which have
shozm themselves controlled by the
coolest heads are betraying los of
patience and temper. Those papers

abatement of its fury. It came in again
at 6 o'clock in the evening and blew

are beyond calculation. Barracks were
flooded, and outer buildings, including
kitchens and dining rooms, were de

Officers' quarters south of the bar
racks were demolished and their furni

wrecked and the beef supplies quickly
spoiled. All that could be saved was
given to the poor, who were without

Special Pispatrh to The Call.
PARIS, Aug. 12.â Following the ar
rest of M. Paul Deroulede a num
ber of members of anti-Semitic
and patriotic leagues were taken
into custody this morning.
A semi-official note issued this morn
ing reads as follows:
A certain number of arrests were made
this morning as the result of a magis
terial inquiry and by virtue of article 89
of the Penal Code regarding conspiracy
organized for the purpose of accomplish
ing a change in the form of government.
The persons Implicated belong to the j
I groups of the Koyalist Youth and the
i patriotic and anti-Semitic leagues. At
the trial of the Neuilly barracks affair
facts relating to the incident alone wen
used as the Basis of the prosecution, but
| searches were then made and documents
I were seized which led to the discovery
of an organization dating back to July.
1898; and of a plot to seize the Government
by force. The documents, leave no room
for doubt either in regard to the exist
ence of the plot or as to the chief actors
therein. After a very close watch proof
was obtained that the same groups were
preparing for a fresh attempt at an early
date, the proof being such as to enable
the disturbances to be averted by imme
diate measures. The Investigation of the
affair is Intrusted to M. Fabre, examining
magistrate.
M. Deroulede was taken into custody '
by four gendarmes and was driven to
Paris. On his arrival here he was in
carcerated in the Conciergerie prison. ;
.When arrested M. Deroulede shouted: !
"It is a rascality on the part of the I
Government, which is trying to impli
cate me in the. same affair as the . Or
leanists, whose adversary. I am."
The arrest of M. Marcel-Ha.bert is
; expected. . .
The police have closed the offices of
the Patriotic League, which are now- â¢
guarded by gendarmes. . :
When an attempt was made to arrest
M. Guerin, president of the Anti-Sem
ite League, he refused to surrender and
barricaded himself in his house. He
says he is prepared to hold out for
three weeks, having a good stock of
food and firearms. The doors and win
dows of bis residence are barricaded,
and M. Guerin announces he will blow
up his house before he surrenders.
On the application of M. Fabre fresh
searches of various houses were made
this morning, including the headquar- j
ters of the anti-Semites, where only '
unimportant papers were seized.
It appears that the officials unearthed
telegrams sent by the Duke of Orleans ;
from Brussels at the time of Persident .
Faure's funeral, the first saying. "All
our men are ready." The second tele- j
gram was dispatched the following
| day, saying, "It is useless to come."
The attempt at an Insurrection
against the Government had in th"
meantime failed. Later, during the
trial of M. Deroulede, traces were dis
covered of a fresh plot and of consulta-

]T)ENNES,Aug. v.âA great
/\ sitting, doubtless the most im
portant of the whole trial.
It can be resumed in a few zcords â
ike breakdown of Merrier. In the
first act we had the vague and hesi
tating deposition of M. de la Roche
\'cruet, attache of the French em
bassy in Berlin, and in the second
act the vibrating speech by former
["resident of the republic M. Casi
mir-Pcrier, and the curtain fell on
the rout of former Minister oj
War Merrier, who left the stag-:
amid the hooting of the audience
after an apparently endless mono
logue. M. de la Roche-Ventet was

speech rather than of a witness' \
evidence, but not without oratorical \
effect. Dreyfus, quite calm and
looking zi.rH. listened with the deep- \
cst attention.
When P crier had seated himself
not far from M. de la Rochc-Vcrnet
General Mercicr entered. He car
ried under his right arm a thick
"serviette" bulging nut with papers,
which he laid upon the witness
table. This lecturer-general possesses
a thankless voice and a thank
less physique, his voice almost re
sembling that of an old woman, and
the face also like that of a lady of
uncertain age. at the corners of
whose mouth a practical joker had
drawn a pair of much-twisted mus
taches. Mercicr concluded by say
ing. "Gentlemen, I know that hu
man nature is fallible. If I had the
least doubt of the justice of the ver
dict of '94 you may rest assured I
would hare acknowledged my
error:'
TJiis he said with unctuous self
satisfaction, turning, as t he did so
toward Dreyfus. Thereupon the
latter, with an intensity of emotion
which ran through the audience tike
an electric shock, was seen to draw
himself up, his countenance all of a
sudden grow red with auger, and
cry out to the very face of his ac
cuser, "That is what you. ought to
do. Yes, that it what you ought to
do."
Mercicr. taken 'by surprise,
stopped and stammered.
"That is your duty.'' Dreyfus
calls out once again, and then he sits
dozi'ii suddenly.
After this explosion the discom
fited accuser tried to add a few
words, which nobody heard, gath
ered together his papers, folded up
his "serz'iclle" and arose. Jeers and
hoofing resounded through the hall,
and a journalist, when the general
passed near, cried out in his face,
"Murderer!''
RENNES, Aug. 12. â When the
Dreyflta trial was resumed this
morning the curtain rose on the
same theater-like scene as on
Monday. The Judges, in uni
form, were seated on the staere
behind the dark cloth-covered table, on
which, in a row. were their kepi?, with
pay-colored plumes and heavy gold
laced bands.
Every seat in court was occupied, in
expectation of a sensational scene.
There were more ladies present than on
Monday. The personage known as
Madame Blanche <The White Lady),
who has attended every move in the
Dreyfus affair, was again present to
day, wearing a superb set of pearls.
But. owing to the expressed objections
of Colonel Jouaust, she changed her
conspicuous place on the right behind
him for a more modest but still notice
able position in the body of the hall.
PKICE FIVE CENTS.
Thore was a large sprinkling of uni
forms in the audience, and a row of
soldiers with fixed bayonets was again
arranged at the bottom of the hall, and
rendered honors in the customary man
ner to the Judges as the latter entered
or left the court.
The proceeding! opened tamely, and
the hope for a sensati<in began to lag
as the morning wore on, and matter 3
began to get tedious as M. I'asimir-
Perier and Gene' Mercier reiterated
what is already known. But this was
only the calm before the storm, and
â¢when the storm broke it carried every
one in the court with it into a whirl
pool of the wildest excitement.
Dreyfus on entering the courtroom
to-day saluted the president with the
same soldierly mem as on Monday last,
and the president. Colonel Jouau?'
turning: the salute, said: "Sit down,
Dreyfus."
The chair of the prisoner was placed,
farther to th^ right of the platform to
day. Instead of facing the Judges
Dreyfus sat with his back t" the table
of his counsel, thus looking across the
platform, straight at the rail at which
the witnesses stood.
Colonel Jouaust, immediately after the
court had settled down, opened the pio
cee'dirigs by asking Dreyfus the following
questions:
" "In January. 1895, the Director of the
: Penitentiary of the Isle dv Roi. in th<*
course of duty, searched the clothes you
brought from the prison. He found this
document in an inside pocket of your
waistccat?"
The president here nanded Dreyfus a
paper and said:
"Do you recognize it as having belonged,
to you?"
Dreyfus â Yes; my colonel.
Jouaustâ Whose was it?
Dreyfusâ Mine.
Jouaustâ Will you tell me how and ur:
--: der what circumstances this document
tame into your possession?
Dreyfusâ lt is a document I used dur
ing my trial, in order to discuss the value
of the bordereau. I wished to keep it.
' Jouaustâ The military code gives you
i the right to have aâ > copy of the docu
ments in your case. This document there
fore was legitimately in your possession.
Why do you; wish to keep It?
Dreyfusâ As a souvenir of the text of
the bordereau. ?-:;-.,.-.-
Jduaust â That was not proper and there
fore, it was taken from you. 1 merely
â wished, to â  elucidate this point. That
will do. , . â¢ . â¢ .
Colonel Jouaust- then asked Major Car
i riere- if he had, any. observations to mike
In behalf, of the Government. The major
replied by asking to have Dr. Hanson'*
! report on Dreyfus read, which the â !â¢ rk
! of the' court did.
The report deals with the measures of
\ surveillance over Dreyfus adopted during
I the voyage of the prisoner to Cayenne,
and said among other things that he was
seen on board seated on a stool and weep

i translation of the Panizardi speech, which
was'a very minute and complicated nat
ter. Several drafts, he explained, were
first made, and finally an official transla

as since published.
Questioned respectively regarding th<s
draft and specifications, he said they were
purely hypothetical, the first draft only
having two words. "Captain Dreyfus," of

the sense being that Dreyfus had been ar
[ rested and that he had no relations with
Germany.
M. Paleologue of the French Fore^n Of
fice was then called, and disagreed to
some of this witness' statements. But
the net result of the two witnesses' re
plies to MM. Laborie and Demange was
that never in the translation was there
any question of relations with Germany.
M. Laborie. on eliciting the foregoing,
showed evident satisfaction. The witness'
rail was empty for a few moments, and!
i then Colonel Jouaust .said, solemnly:
1 "Bring In the next witness."
. An infantry .sergeant, seated beneatn
Major Carriere's desk, then walked to the
middle of the court, where in a crimson
armchair, placed there for distinguished
witnesses, sat Casimir-Perier, formerly
President of France. The latter was con
-1 ducted by the soldier and ascended the
platform. He was dressed in a black
1 frock coat, with the rosette of the Legion
[of Honor at his buttonhole, and light
check trousers, and carried a silk hat in
his hand..
In response to the usual questions he

M Casimir-Perier then recounted how
he had expressed to the then Premier and
Minister of War his astonishment ana in
dignation at the interview which Captain
Le Brun-Renault had given the Figaro on
the subject of Dreyfus. The witness then
told of Colonel Pic Quart's visit to the
Elvsoo at the trial In 1894, informing him
that M Bertillon's demonstration had lit
tle effect on the Judges. He added:
"I received M Hertillon December 14
and 15 at the instance of the Minister of
War who thought his demonstrations very
curious, interesting and conclusive, but I
must confess." said M. Casimir-Perier,
amid a general titter in court, "that I
judge* them differently. He added: "All
that was done and said among the Minis
ters was done without my knowledge.'
The witness then related the facts in
connection with the futile efforts of M.
Waldeck-Rousseau to prevent the first
court-martial sitting behind closed doors
and said he (the witness) had never re
ceived any member of the Dreyfus family.
M. Casimir-Perier concluded this part of
his statement by raising his voice and
Bpeaking very excitedly while saying:
â¢Tor the honor of the chief magistracy
which 1 occupied, for Ihe honor of the
republic, I will not allow it to be said
that I hail exchanged a word with a cap
tain in the French army accused of trea
son."
This caused applause in court,
â which Colonel Jouaust speedily sup
pressed, threatening to clear the h;ill if
.' ;! s any rÂ« n of it
> people in the courtroom thought
M Caeimir-Perier was somewhat thi
<-al in this utterance, as he turned and
delivered as much to the audience as to
. v rt . t
The former 1 nded his state
by saying: "I affirm, before this
tribunal of soldiers, that my resignation
was not connected with the diplomatic in
cident concerning Germany, it pains me
not to i>'. a!'!-- to second the court in thÂ»Â»

Various questions were then ask.-l M.

fus had confessed to him, and the witn< sa
said, emphatically, that he never had

but he affirmed that the captain did not

M. Demange men introduced the ques
tion of the letter which the anti-Drey
fusards asserted Dreyfus wrote to in.
<"asimir-Perler and in which it is claimed
be spoke of engagements entered into by
M. Casimir-Perier respecting him.
The wit: Ltically replied that
he had never entered into any such en
gagement as alleged, and he asked that
the letter which was published by the
Eclair of Paris should be-produced in
and that the whole matter be
ed up. M. Casimir-Perier ended thk
ptatement with a slap of his hand on the
rail of the desk.
Colonel Jouaust then asked Dreyfus if
he had anything to say. Thereupon tlie
prisoner rose and accompanying his ut
terancea with gestures of his right hand
said:
"My words have certainly been distort
ed, for I have no recollection of such a let
ter. The words the former President of
the republic have just uttered are ekact.
I have never, even in my mind, supposed
there wan _ iru-nt undertaken by
him and that he had not held thereto. M.
I.'emange here asked me. at the tim<> of the
trial. In conveying through M. Waldeek-
Kousseau my request for a public trial,
that this publicity should only be on con
dition that the question or' the origh; ..f
the documents remained secret. 1 gave
my word of honor not to raise thin, ques
tion, and in that 1 bow before thp superior
Interests of" my country. In my mind it
Was with the defense, and not with the
PresidÂ«nl of the republic., that the word
cf honor was given. 1 never had an ld< a
that an engagement was made between
the President and myself. Never 1 , never."
Jouaost â Then you declare false these
letters In which it is said the President of
the republic entered into certain engage
ments with you?
Dreyfus replied: "In nny case the sense
has been completely distorted."
M. Casimir-Perier gave his evidence with
a blanched face, but In the determined
tone of a man who maintains every word
uttered, which inspired confidence in his
words.
The members of the court-martial lis
tened to him respectfully. When bia t> s
tlmony whs ended M. Casimir-Perier was
conducted back to his seat by a non-com
missioned officer, and all eyes were direct
ed toward a door to the right.
There was a moment of painful sus
pense and then Genei il Mercler entered
the courtroom and was conducted to
the witness stand by a soldier. He lifted
his right hand before the crucifix and
swore to tell the whole truth. He ap
peared to be broken in health. He spoke
with a hoarse voice, coughed frequently
and a:-ked to be allowed to be seated.
Mercier was attired in the undress uni
form of a generalâ black tunic and red
trousers. As he sat down he piaced a
brilliant crimson and gold kepi on a
shelf attached to the witness rail, where
it remained a striking patch of color dur
ing the time he gave his testimony,
which lasted from 8:10 a. m. until noon.
He leaned forward while speaking, his
hand sometimes resting on the rail, but
more often he was nervously twitching
his lingers and twisting a pair of white
gloves, which he doffed on entering the
court. Ik-side his kepi be placed a black
leather wallet full or papers, and he ac
companied his remarks with a continual
nodding of the head. To a stranger his
appearance and bearing produced a far
from a favorable effect. He gave the im
pression of shiftiness; his forehead was
wrinkled, his eyebrows were contracted
and his eyes peered through slits between
puffy eyelids. His cheeks were sallow
and he spoke almost inaudibly and in a J
weak, monotonous pitch of voice, which
produced a soporific effect upon those
who were not able to distinguish his
words, but who were within hearing of
his voice. â¢ â  . .;
This monotone, with hardly a break, ex
cept when the clerk read the various
documents, Mercier presented to the
court, lasting nearly four hours, with tea
minutes' suspension at 11, when there
was a general feeling that the witness
was going to provoke, as the Dreyfusards
predcited, an utter fiasco.
Genera] Mercier wore on his breast the
decoration of grand officer of the .Legion
of Honor. While be was under examina
tion General Mercier asked Colonel
j Jouaust to allow him to present a docu
ment showing how an espionage system
was organized in France by Colonel
Schwartzkoppen, the former German
military attache at Paris. The document
referred to the fortifications of the
Meuse.
General Mercier then entered Into an
explanation tending to prove that
Schwartzkoppen was at the head of the
German espionage system in France and
afterward had the favored letter con
taining the words "Cette canaille de
]>â read.
In the meanwhile Dreyfus watched
Mercier through his eyeglass, but appar
j ently quite unmoved. The witness who
, displayed the deepest interest was M.
! Casimir-Perier, seated in front of a row ,
of private seats. He leaned forward with
his hands on his knees, except when ex
cited, when he lifted up his hands in an
expressive gesture of disgust or Impa- I
tience.
Mercier. who had his back turned to the
former President, saw nothing of this,
j but after he had completed his testimony
and had reiterated all the charges con
i tamed in M. d'Ormeschville's bill of in
dictment, Mercier presented a document
to be read by the clerk, which proved to
be the alleged Dreyfus letter concerning:
the alleged engagement entered Into with
M. Casimir-Perier. which the latter had j
so hotly denounced. The last breath had '
barely left the clerk's lips when M. Casi- I
mir-Perier jumped up and shouted: I
"That is the letter I read in the news- !
paper!"
General Mercier, startled , turned around I
and muttered excuses, saying he did not j
believe a President of the republic would
enter into such an engagement.
To this M. Casimir-Perier retorted in a
tone of the bitterest sarcasm, "Thank
you. general, for this testimonial."
At the end of his evidence General Mer
cier said he believed that the only motive j
of Dreyfus' treason was that Dreyfus had j
no feeling of patriotism.
This cruel utterance brought forth
hisses from the audience, whose blood
had been sent up to fever heat by the j
witness" savage attacks on Dreyfus. " Gen
eral Meicler, hearing the hisses, terminat
ed with remarking:
"If the least doubt crossed my mind,
â  gentlemen, I would be the first to declare i
it to you and say before you to Captain :
i Dreyfus. "1 am mistaken, but in good !
j faith.' " i
Then Dreyfus electrified his hearers. '<
He jumped to his feet as though the
words had galvanized him into new life
j and shouted with a voice which rang
throughout the hall like a trumpet note:
"That is what you ought to say."
The audience burst into a wild cheer,
whereupon the ushers called for silence.
General Mercier then stammered: "I
would (i me and say, 'Captain Dreyfus. I
was mistaken in good faith, and I come
with the same good faith to acknowledge
it. and I will do all in human power to
repair the frightful error.' "
The prisoner then shouted, "Why don't
you, then? That is your duty."
At this there was another outburst of
applause General Mercier, after a pause
when the excitement had partially
calmed, said:
"Well, no. My conviction since ]594 has
noi suffered th< slightest weakening, it I
is fortified by the deepest study of the
and also by the inanity of the
means resorted to for the purpose of
proving the innocence of the condemned
man (if 1894 in spite of the evidence accu
mulated ;ind in spite of the millions of
money expended."
Colonel Jouaust then said: "Have you
finished
General Mercier replied "Yes."
Colonel Jouaust then announced that the
sessions "f the court-martial would be
resumed Monday morning.
M. Casimir-Perier thereupon arose and
said: "After the deposition of General â 
Mercier ] shall ask the court to hear me. |
and 1 would prefer to be in confrontation j
with him."
This announcement caused a sensation.
Then followed a thrilling demonstration
against General Mercler. As he turned to
the court the audience rose en mass^
and hissed and cursed him, those at the
back of the court standing on benches and
chairs in order to better hound him.
The gendarmes placed themselves be
tween the general and the audience, which
showed a strong disposition to maltreat
the former Minister of War.
General Mercier hurried out of the court
room through a side door. On emerging
into the street the crowd outside cheered
the general and cried, "Vive l'armee."
"Ah." cried a spectator of the scene in
court, "if they had heard the human mon
ster speak they would not cheer him
now."
One newspaper man In court was arrest
ed for calling General Mercier as he
passed by him a murderer. But later on
the man was released. I>reyfus was hur
ried out by gendarmes, who immediately
cieared the courtroom.
MERCIER PLAYED THE
WELL-WORN WAR SCARE
RENNES. Aug. 12.â General Mercler
played the now well-worn war scare to
day, but the effect must be very discour
aging to him, as his hearers listened with
out stirring a muscle to his story of how
France was on the threshold of a war
with Germany. The anti-Drey fusards
have cried "Wolf!" too often.
At the outset of General Mercler.'s tes
timony he prepared the court for a war
scare by declaring that the Emperor of
Germany personally took an active part
in organizing espionage, and then later,
when he defended his action in com
municating the secret dossier to th"c
court-martial of li'M, he said:
"I no longer have reason to keep silent,
and I am going to accomplish what I con
sider my uuty. Jn 1594 the diplomatic sit
uation was perilous. M. Hanotaux, then
Minister of Foreign Affairs, has indicated |
this. M. Casimir-Perier has spoken be
fore the criminal chamber about the un
usual step taken by Count yon Munster.
He also exposed the somewhat unusual
way by which he could double himself in
to "an official personage and a private
personage, later giving Count yon Mun
ster information which was at first re
fused him.
"But M. Casimir-Perier amended his
deposition, saying he had not said that
the same day he, M. JJupuy and mystll
remained from 8 in the evening until 12:30
in his private office at the Elysee wait
ing the result of telegraphic communlcn
tions between the Emperor of Germi.ij
and Count yon Munster. He remained
four hours and a half awaiting to see if
anything would result from this exchange
of telegraais."
Here M. C'apimir-Perier shook his head
and hand in emphatic denial of Geneuu
Mercier' a statement.
The latter continued: "I bad been in
formed in the afternoon that the situa
tion was very grave. Count yon Munster
handed an order from his sovereign to
ask for his passports if his demand ran !
not conceded. I was prepared to give '.he j
order for mobilization. You s>ee, we were I
within an ace of war. It was only at
12:2<J thnt M. Casimir-Porler notified mÂ°
that Count yon Munster had accepted the
Insertion of a somewhat vague note de-.
daring the Embassador was not in
volved."
M. Casimir-Perier here again made a re
pudiating gesture.
General Herder continued to explain
that this was the reason for his action
regarding the secret dossier.
If Dreyfus is guilty he must possess
superhuman nerve, for he listened to I
General Mericer's pitiless arraignment I
this morning until he approached the end
of his deposition with sphinx-like rigidity
cf features, but watched Mercler like a
cat watches a mouse. No one would have
suspected the volcano within Dreyfus
which burst forth when human flesh "and
blood could stand it no longer. The only
THE SAN FKANCISCO CALL., SUNDAY, AUGUST 13, 1899.
SHERMAN'S COURSE FROM YOKOHAMA TO SAN FRANCISCO.
IF all went well the transport Sherman, with the California boys aboard, had at noon yesterday (San Francisco
time) covered 1075 nautical miles of the distance that separates Yokohama from this port. In that event she
was about twelve days' steaming from home. If the Sherman keeps up this rate of speed she will be 108 miles
(nautical) distant from the Golden Gate at noon on the 24th inst. By burning a little more coal Captain Grant
may bring his vessel to the Farallones at that hour, but if he finds it impossible to do so the chances are he will
slow the Sherman down and make the Farallones at noon on the 25th.
Judging from the speed the Sherman made on her last voyage, and allowing for her improved condition, j. T.
McMillan, United States nautical expert, figures that at noon yesterday (San Francisco time) the Sherman was in
latitude 38 degrees 45 minutes north, longitude 160 degrees 30 minutes east, or 3588 miles from San Francisco.
A large copy of the above map showing the course of the transport is ojj&exhibition in the window on the
Market-street side of the business office of The Call. The map Is attracting atfreat deal of attention, and crowds
are gathered about the window to view it from early morning till late at night.
sign of the fire within was the heaving of
his bosom and the parching of his lips and
palate, which he occasionally moistened
with his tongue. A casual observer might
have missed these indications and imag
ined that he waa an image cut In stone,
with the eyes fixed on Mercier.
But, when at last his feelings obtained
the mastery and he sprang to his feet
and faced his accuser, man to man, one
appreciated the depth of his previously
suppressed emotions, and Mercier, who,
startled, had Jumped to his feet at tho
ringing sound of Dreyfus' voice, recoiled
before the terrible look Dreyfus threw at
him and stood aghast, wondering whether
the prisoner was going to spring upon
him.
Colonel Jouaust and the other members
of the court-martial, in the meantime,
had risen and seized the two men, while
the court rang with the cheers of the
spectators.
General Mercier, when he haa finished
his testimony, nccording to general opin
ion, had said really nothing and proved
nothing. The overwhelming proofs he was
to have thrown down before the mem
bers of thÂ»- court-martial like a bombshell,
failed to appear and he left the court dis
credited.
LONDON HEBREWS

to Adopt.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 12.â Inspector
General Breckinridge had a brief in
terview with Secretary Root to-day

in our army up to the present time.
Another statement showed the position
of General Breckinridge in the matter
of inspections, pointing out the methods
he had adopted and making sugges
tions. Secretary Root will take up the
whole subject at a later date.

PENSACOL.A, Fla., Aug. 12.â A ter
rific storm swept over Pensacola and

Two Tennessee Negroes Killed and a
Third Wounded.
BBLLBUCKIiE, Term., Aug. 12.â Much
feeling between ' the races has been
aroused by the lynching yesterday of the
negro Will Chambers for assaulting a 14

mounted Indian police returned from the
Trinity County hills to-night after a fruit
less chase of twenty-four hours after
Mcdi me Man Wahmooh and his band.
The Government police seem to have come
to the end of their resources. Friends
and relatives of Wahmooh deny having
any knowledge of his whereabouts. But
when he was missing they felt sure he
was lost or perhaps had been overtaken
by violent death.
"indications to-night are that the influ

come the war spirit.

I tlons at which the question was dls- I
j cussed whether the attempt should be i
made to change the form of government j
I before or after the Rennes court-mar- â 
i tial. The Government, thereupon, judg
ing that the time for action had ar- >
1 rived, ordered a number of arrests to '
be made, all of which apparently have
not yet been effected.
A police commissary called at 4 a. m.
: at the residence of M. Thiebault, on the
. Quai Voltaire, and a number of police
! men surrounded the house. But M.
I Thiebault escaped by a balcony to an !
adjoining house. The police have seized j
the Drapeau (newspaper) office.
The house of Andre de Buffet, a rep- j
j resentative of the Duke of Orleans and
vice president of the Toung Royalist
League, was searched and a number of :

ing soldiers to plebiscite on thÂ« form of '.

The police have placed seals upon the
doors of Jules Guerin's residence, in
which he still defies them.
At Nancy a man named Pisson was
â  arrested on the charge of espionage
! and 'was condemnt-d t>> three years' im
| prisonment, 500 francs fine and to be
i deprived of civil rights for a decade.
| Of the seventeen warrants of arrest is
sued only fourteen were executed.
M. Fabre began to interrogate Paul
Deroulede this evening. As the cells at
police headquarters are all occupied,
several of the prisoners will be trans
ferred to the Prison de la Sante.
According to rumors current in offi
cial circles, the affair is likely to pro
duce serious consequences. It is stated
that the Government possesses precise
and detailed instructions from the Due
d'Orleans to his agents. It is pointed
out that when the arrest of Deroulede
was made, no outsiders knew that the
partisans of the Duke of Orleans were
mixed up in the affair.
Curiously enough. Prince Victor Bon
aparte has been closely watched by the
Orleanists for several months, they
fearing that he might disturb the
schemes.
MM. Deroulede, chief of the League
of Patriots, and Marcel-Habert, a mem
ber of the Chamber of Deputies, were
arrested on the evening of February 23
last, on the charge of inciting soldiers
to insubordination in connection with
the election of President Loubet.
On May 31, the prisoners, who had
been on trial before the Assize Court
in Paris, were acquitted, although dur
ing the proceedings M. Deroulede ad
mitted that he wished to lead a brigade
to overthrow the parliamentary repub
lic; that his action was fully premedi
tated and that he would not cease his
attempts to overthrow parliamentar
ism. He acknowledged he was guilty of
all the charges except the allegation
that he wanted to lead the soldiers
astray without a leader. He said. "I
wanted a general at their head. I
would have preferred the commander
in-chief. Unhappily I had no choice."
He finished his harangue by asking a
plebiscitary republic, Asserting at the
same time that he never intended to
turn the soldiers from their duty, but
only wished to carry General Roget,
who was in command of the troops,
with him. M. Marcel-Habert also ad
mitted that he wished to cause a revo
lution, but denied having incited sol
diers to disobedience. He said he only
sought to lead General Roget to the
Elysee palace, and that the men with
him had been merely following the offi
cers.

FRESNO, Aug. 12.â Scott & Bcotfi liv

Enforcing the Fish Laws.
ASTORIA, Or., Auk. 12.â Deputy Fish
Commissioners Loughery and Koegun
made several arrests of gill netters and
seiners for fishing contrary to the close
season law last night and this morning.
The men arrested all had big catches and
pleaded the enormous run of fine fish in
extenuation. The gill netters were bound
over until Monday under bonds given by
the local cannery men. The seiners, fi\>;
in number, were each fined $50 and paid
their tines without contest. It is now
apparent that the commissioners of both
Washington and Oregon propose to strict
ly enforce the law. Several canneries
were reported to be in operation on the
Washington side to-day, but it is alleged
they merely engaged in "cleaning up ui'l

DENVER, Aug. 12.â Two police offi
cers were murdered here at 1 o'clock
to-night by recruits belonging to Com
pany L, Thirty-fourth Volunteer In
fantry, now stationed at Fort Logan.
The soldiers had been raising a disturb
ance in Louis Klipfel's saloon at the i
corner of Market and Twentieth streets
during the evening, and Officer Tom
Clifford was notified of their actions
and asked to keep his eye on them.
He followed them for an hour or so
and came upon the men at the corner of !
Blake and Twentieth streets. He was j
about to accost the soldiers, when one
of them turned on him and, placing the
muzzle of a revolver to his breast sent
a bullet through his heart. Clifford ex
pired almost instantly.
Two of the men were captured and
gave their names as Bryant and Cum
mings. They say they do not know
the name of the man who did thp kill
ing. Officer W. E. Griffith started on a
bicycle in pursuit of the man who did
the shooting.
He was gaining on him rapidly, when
the murderer ceased running, drew his
revolver and shot Crifflth through the
body, killing him almost instantly. At
a late hour the double murderer had
not been captured, and the entire de
tective force of the city has been placed
on his track.
CITIZENS SWINDLED
BY A CONFIDENCE MAN
No Branch of Trade in Pacific Grove
Slighted by the Wily
Operator.
PACIFIC GROVE, Aug. 12.-Several res
idents of this town are making anxious in
quiries to-day for Allen Drew of Stockton,
| who departed early this morning, taking a
good deal of money and other property
belonging to business men of Pacific
Grove. Before leaving he succeeded In
i doing the townspeople pretty thor
oughly.
About three weeks ago a well-dressed
man, apparently about 35 years old and
giving his name as Allen Drew of Stock
ton, rented a large cottage from H. W.
, Briggs, a real estate man. When the cus-
I tomary advance payment was asked fur
j he said his funds were all in checks, which
I would follow him here in a day or two.
I Briggs let him have possession of the cot
tage, and he proceeded at once to rent all
the rooms to other persons, invariably
collecting the rent in advance. When he
had been here a day or two he negotiated
for a lot, and going to J. B. Norton, a
merchant, told him the same story about
the checks, and asked for a temporary
loan of money to make the first payment
j on the lot. Norton let him have the money
â¢ and has not seen him since. In the. same
i way he went through the town, swindling
the restaurant keepers, transfer men, gro
cers, butchers and. indeed, somebody in
nearly every line of business In town. He
finished by "skipping" with a valuable
camera which he had taken on Friday
from the Eagle pharmacy "to try," anil
which he said he would buy if It proved
satisfactory.
Those who suffered through his opera
tions have taken all possible steps to catch
the thief, but no trace of him has been

THE ENLISTMENT OF
FIVE NEW REGIMENTS
Secretary Believes a Display of
Troops Will Bring Insur
gents into Subjection.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, WEL
LINGTON HOTEL, WASHINGTON.
Aug. 12. â Secretary Root has again
demonstrated his purpose to vigorously
assist General Otis to suppress the in
surrection in the Philippines by seri
ously considering the enlistment of not
Â«ss than five, additional volunteer regi
ments.
The exact number to be called for is
one of the matters under considera
tion, and if the recommendation of Gen
eral Miles is adopted the entire volun
teer force authorized by Congress will
be organized and dispatched to Manila,
bo as to bring an end to the rebellion
before the end of the coming dry sea-
Fon. At a conference with Secretary
Root yesterday General Miles urged
That no time be lost in enlisting all of
the 85,000 volunteers authorized. Of this
number 1..4L7. including a battalion of
natives in Porto Rico, will be contained
in the regiments now being organized,
leaving 17,583 who can be recruited and
sent to reinforce General Otis. Prom
General Miles' point of view the moral
effect of the organization of the entire
volunteer force will be beneficial, as it
will prove to the insurgent leaders and
their men the undoubted purpose of the
United States to bring about their
prompt subjection.
Secretary Root has already phown
that he Is in hearty sympathy with the
desire of the President to bring the in-
BUrrectlon to an end with all possible
dispatch, and while General Otis has
not asked for any more men than the
60,000 it has been Intended to send him,
the Secretary believes it will be to the
interest of this Government to have as
large a force as possible in Manila, In
order that the territory conquered by
the American troops may be properly
garrisoned and the rebels thus prevent
ed from reoceupying it.
The great defect of the American
campaign of last spring was due to a
lack of troops to remain )n possession
of the territory from which the insur
gent? had been driven. With thp force
whi^h It "1^ intended to give him the
tary Is confident that General Otis
will be able to drive the insurgents
bsu k and to station enough troops in
rritory conquered to hold it and to
maintain peace and order.

a leak had sprung in that great embank-
ment which saves Holland from the devas-
tations of the hungry sea. It was early in
the night, and no one was near at hand.
The leak was small when he found it, but
he knew that the action of the water would
enlarge it long before morning, and wash-
away the entire embankment, inundate the
country and destroy his own and thou-
sands of homes. So he bravely put his
finger in the crevasse, and kept it there all
the long night through, until help came and
the opening was properly stopped. He had
saved his country. â¦
Equally insignificant is the entrance of
disease into the human system. The be-
ginnings of the most terrible ailments are
bo small they can be easily stopped at the
start. Your health is a dike which keeps
out and stops the inroads of dangerous and
devastating disease. Whenever it breaks
down, no matter how slightly, there is an
opening for disease to enter. " If the open-
ing is not watched, it will grow larger,
until the sweep of disease overwhelms
you, and health and perhaps life is de-
stroyed forever.
Fortify your health with Dr. Pierces
Golden Medical Discovery, and you can
defy ill-health. You can make your health
so strong a bulwark that disease cannot
find a crevice through which it can creep.
Taken in time, Dr. Pierces remedies pre-
vent greater and more serious troubles.
Hundreds write daily to Dr. Pierce, telling
him how these remedies have saved them
and made them strong.
Constipation causes and aggravates many
serious diseases. It is speedily cured by
Dr. Pierces Pleasant Pellets.
Such splendid progress has been j
made in recruiting the ten regiments
organized in this country that depart
ment officials have no fear that any
difficulty would be experienced in re
cruiting the additional regiments con
templated. The same methods of re
cruiting would be followed and Secre
tary Hoot considered this after
noon a list of officers to be
placed in command of the con
templated regiments. These offi
cers, if it is decided to organize the reg
iments, will be sent to take the places
of officers of volunteer regiments who
have been engaged in recruiting duty
for the month past.
The ten volunteer regiments were
only 523 short this morning and reports
to be received on Monday are expected :
to show that all the men required for i
these reÂ£pin.-nts have been obtained. Aj
few days' recruiting will be sufficient, j
it is believed, to fill the skeleton regi- j
ments organized by Genera! Otis at Ma
nila, and then recruiting will be con
tinued for the proposed regiments. An
average of more than 500 recruits per
day have been enlisted, so that in two
' time the 6545 men needed for the
five- additional regiments can be ob
tained. In connection with the enlist
ment of additional volunteers, Sere
tary Root has carefully considered the >
question of transportation.
It is his expectation that the entire \
force of 50.000 men heretofore fixed as
the number to be placed at General
Otis' disposal will have reached Manila
by November 1. The vessels carrying j
this force will return to San Francisco I
for additional troops, the Secretary's I
idea being that they will return to San !
Francisco as quickly as possible and
take on board additional troops until ;
the entire number Intended to be at- j
tached to General Otis' command has
been assembled In the Philippines.
General Luddington seems to be confi
dent that no trouble will be experi
enced in getting five additional regi- I
ments over to Manila in time for the j
coming campaign, and a table prepared j

retary shows the approximate dates of ;

Secretary Cridler. summing up what
had been done and giving much light on
personal phases of the inquiry. .Mr.
Tripp took occasion to dispose of a re
port that the failure of Mr. Eliot, the
British Commissioner, to return with
the party on the Badger had any in
ternational significance. He said Mr.
Eliot had gone home by way of New
Zealand because he had a sister living
there and desired to visit her. No men
tion was made of the circumstances
leading up to the retirement of Chief
Justice Chambers. Mr. Tripp will not
come to Washington at once, but will
first go to his home in Yankton, S. D.
After going over the report Mr.
Cridler will make a summary to be for

the report is on hand it remains for
the three governments to determine
whether the recommendation of the
committee is to be accepted, and as yet
there has been no step in that direc
tion.
GOLD-BEARING QUARTZ
STRUCK AT ATLIN
Two Lucky Prospectors Believe They
Have Found the District's
Mother Lode.
VICTORIA, B. C, Aug. 12.â The
steamer Tees reached here to-night
! from the north with seventy-eight, pas
! sengers from Dawson, Atlin and other
! points on the Yukon. She had about
â  1100,000 in gold, pretty evenly distribut
; ed among the passengers, none of hay
; ing large amounts. The Dawsonites
started for the outside on the night of
August 2. and were ten days to the
hour in making the trip. The railway
i company is now running three trains
! daily and the lake and river steamers
i are making close connections, -which
! accounts for the fast time. It is said
i the company has purchased the tram
way around White Horse Rapids, to
obtain the right-of-way, and will im
mediately extend the road down the
I river.
The river steamers Tyrell and Angli
< can, both reported total wrecks, have
i been floated and taken to Dawson.
Sergeant Hislett of the Mounted Police
says all the rough characters are to be
shipped out of the Yukon country be
winter.
Just before the Tees left Skaguay
news was received there of a valuable
quartz find, supposed to be the mother
lode of the Atlin placer deposits. The
find was made by C. A. Anderson and
J. Pearson, prospectors who for weeks
have been out in the Big Horn country-
The lucky miners discovered a ledge of
gold-bearing quartz, which was traced
for some distance and which gave such
j evidences of richness that they Imme
-1 diately staked the ground and left for
Bennett with samples of ore. At Cari
boo Crossing an assay was made by
Chief Engineer Lewis of the railway
company, who was so impressed with
the value of the discovery that he im
mediately supplied provisions to the
two prospectors and a party of his own
men to return at once and locate more
claims.
WHEAT BLOCKADE,
Flood of Grain Pouring Into Stockton
Warehouses.
STOCKTON, Aug. 12.â This was an
other wheat blockade day on the front.
Wagon loads of grain went in a con
tinuous stream all the forenoon to the
warehouses, and before the warehouse
men had disposed of the team grain
wheat began to arrive by rail in train
load lots. Every warehouse on the
front was looking for truckers, and sev
eral of the deckhands on the steamers
left their jobs to go trucking in the
warehouses, where they were paid bet
ter wages. Consequently the mates of
the steamers were out looking for
stevedores. The Dauntless was in need
of six men and the other steamers were
short-handed from two to ten men
each.
The market was slightly better than
it had been for weeks. It assumed a
stronger attitude this afternoon and
considerable milling wheat changed
hands at 1 02%.
Captain Smith seems to be about the
only one doing any business in barley.
He purchased 6000 bags of brewing
goods yesterday and 3000 to-day. All
of his grain he ships to Port Costa for
storage.

YAQUI PLOT
TO DESTROY A
MEXICAN TOWN
Inhabitants Were to Be
Murdered and the City
Burned.
RINGLEADERS SHOT
A Sharp Encounter at Vicain in
Which Thirty-Seven Braves
Were Killed.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
GUAYMAS, Mex., Aug. 12.â Advices
received here from an official source
confirm the report that the Mayo In
dians were co-operating with the
Yaquis In the present uprising.
At Huatabampo a plot of the com
bined forces of the Mayos and Yaquis
to attack ;md burn the town was dis
covered. They were to be assisted by
the Mayo and Yaqui residents of the
town, who at a given signal were to
kill their employers and masters. *'
Prudeneio Cruz, a Mayo Indian, be
trayed the plot, and Miguel Cruz,
known as the chief of the cavalry of
the Mayos, and Igrnaeio Jojocoli, chief
of the Yaquis at Huatabampo, were
discovered and captured, together with
the remaining ringleaders.
They were shot on the following
morning, and a guard placed around
the town to prevent the remaining In
dians from leaving and taking part In
the uprising.
A small but well mounted body of
Yaquis attempted to surprise the town
of Cocoraquinto, but were repulsed by
the inhabitants. Among the killed
were found several Mayo Indians, con
firming the rumors of their participa
tion in the present struggle.
MEXICO CITY, Aug. 12. â Official dis
patches received here to-day under
date of Term report two severe battles
between the Mexican troops and Yaqui
Indians. One dated the 10th says:
"To-day General Lorenzo Torres had
a new encounter with the Indian rebels.
The Federal troops came upon the In
dians near the forest surrounding
Vicain and a sharp engagement follow
ed, in which thirty-seven Indians were
killed, while the Federal loss was but
ten men. The operations continue with
great activity and to-day's victory
gives much encouragement."
A dispatch dated the 11th says: "At
5 o'clock this morning General Torres
started out, and with the Twelfth Bat
talion and the National Guard of the
State, came upon the abandoned camp
of the Indians, but, fearing an ambus
cade, sent out scouts to avoid a sur
prise. Soon sharp firing from the In
dians, hidden in the undergrowth, was
experienced and fighting became gen
eral. Tho enemy fled, leaving seventy
dead on the field. General Torres re
ceived a slight wound and thnre were
three killed and thirteen wounded."
SAYS YAQUI WAR WAS
STARTED BY SCHEMERS
LONG BEACH, Aug. 12.â "You may
safely gamble your last cent there is
some big colonization scheme behind all
this Yaqul business," said John A.
Gowan of this city to a Call man to
day. "I have been among the Yaquis for
years," he continued, "have had hun
dreds of them working for me and at
one time could speak their language,
though now a great many of the words
have gone from me. I found* them a
peaceable, industrious class, much bet
ter than the average Indian. They
have their little patches of ground upon
which they raise vegetables and sell
them to the miners and in the small
towns, working between crops at what
ever may come along. Frugality is one
of their characteristics, and it is seldom
indeed you find one of them broke. To
be sure, they drink a little on feast
days, but what better could you expect?
For all they are quiet and peace-loving
these Yaquis will fight when occasion
demands, and do a good job at it, too;
in fact, they are too much for the Mex
ican soldiers, as has been proven on
many a field.
"They own thousands of acres of the
finest land in Mexico, along the Yaqui
River, and for years there have been
hundreds of men looking for some ex
cuse to take it from them. In this, It is
my opinion, will be found the real cause
of this difficulty. Some schemers have
taken advantage of the fact that the
men were full of mescal to embroil
them with prospectors or other intrud
ers, knowing that a war could only re
sult in the opening of the coveted land
to settlement. Then there are the men
who used to draw large salaries from
the Government, to say nothing of the
pickings for feeding the soldiers in the
old war times who have been out of
jobs during the peace. All of them are
naturally anxious to see trouble Btart
ed, and between the two it has been
easy enough to force these unforunate
SAVES A BABE'S LIFE
BUT LOSES HIS OWN
Paul Montgomery of Fort Bragg Sinks to
His Death in the Waters of Lake
Coeur d'Alene,
SPOKANE, Wash., Aug. 12.â Paul Montgomery of Fort Bragg, Men
docino County, Cal., to-day gave up his life in rescuing the child of
a friend from drowning. Though weak from a long illness, he
sprang from the boat as the child fell into the waters of Lake
Coeur d'Alene. He held the baby above water until those in the
boat could take it from his arms; then, without a cry, totally exhausted,
he sank. His body has not yet been recovered.
Miss Montgomery witnessed her father's brave rescue and its fatal
termination. She was nearly crazed at the occurrence.
Mr. Montgomery leaves a widow and three small children now living
at Fort Bragg. He came north from California "three weeks ago and
was joined here by his grown daughter yesterday. They left the city
this morning for Gem, Idaho, where Mr. Montgomery was to take charge
of a hotel. At the lake they met friends from California and decided to
stay over a day. A boating trip was suggested, and Mr. and Mrs. E. N.
Mason. Mrs. C. Cole, the latter's four-year-old son and Mr. and Miss
Montgomery entered the boat. They were about a mile from shore when
the boy leaned too far over the edge of the boat and fell in.
Montgomery was rowing. He dropped the oars and jumped in after
the child. Several minutes elapsed before those in the boat secured the
oars and rowed to Montgomery. The mother lifted the bcry, who was un
harmed, from Montgomery's arms, and then before those in the boat
could seize him Montgomery sank. He was 52 years old.
PRISON OFFICIALS
IN LEAGUE WITH
THE OPIUM RING
San Quentin Smugglers Fer=
reted Out by Warden
Aguirre.
SAN QUENTIN PRISON, Aug. 12.â
Warden Aguirre has obtained in
formation leading to the downfall
of the opium "ring," whose opera
tions have led to the death of
many an unfortunate and brought
physical ruin to ten times as
many others. Aguirre's detective work
will result In the discharge of several
officials and guards at the prison.
The only free man suspected of com
plicity in the opium smuggling, whose
name can be ascertained, is C. Pretzel,
a subordinate officer having charge of
what is known as the "hoodoo," or
water-front gang of convicts. Pretzel
is a brother-in-law of* Attorney James
iW. Cochrane of San Rafael. He has
i hitherto enjoyed an unblemished repu
! tation and there are few who will be
lieve that he is guilty of the offense
charged against him unless the evi
dence proves to be of a positive nature.
The three convict ringleaders in the |
smuggling operationsâ F. L. B&rney,
i James Marshall and C. W. Fiikinsâ are
now confined in the dungeon, with six ;
or seven of what are known as "mer- j
chants" and "peddlers" of the drug. |
: They will remain there on a diet of {
bread and water until Tho Warden sees
flit to bring the facts before the Prison
i Directors. , , ,

' that Barney, who is serving a seven

were under suspicion has been jealou

they are compelled to fight.
â¢â¢ill this talk about there being 7000
or SOOO warriors ready to take the field
is no better than rot. They could not
muster more than 500 if the whole tribe
went to war. This exaggeration la but
a part of the general plot and is in
tended to bring as many soldiers as
possible on the ground in order to in
crease the pickings. I remember very
well how it was during the war of 90.
At that time I wanted to visit some
mines the road to which took me di
rectly through the Yaqui country. At
Ortez I made up a party consisting of
a Texan who seemed to be actually
fond'of trouble and two Yaquis ; for
driver and outrider. It took some time
: and not a little 'fixin' ' to secure a pass
through such a troubled country. YV c
went out through San Marcial to Ona
vas on the Yaqui River, near which the
mine was located, and returned to San
Marcial without mishap. Here we
found the country in an uproar, the In
dians being expected every m'nute
The Alcalde positively refused to let
us leave, but by the use of the proper
persuasion and the generous applica
tion of mescal to my Yaquis we man
aged to get out early that night.
â¢'About half way between San Mar*
cial and Ortez Is a spring known as
Punta de Aqua, which Is celebrated
throughout all that country and a
popular camping ground. %\ hen near it

the news that the Indians were near at

made my Yaquis bold enough to fight
all the Indians in the Southwest and we
proceeded cautiously in the direction of
the spring. There we found where a
pack train had been held up, the packs
lined up along the side of the road and
the mules taken, but there were no In
dians in sight. From this point we
made a wide detour to Fort La Mesa,
where we had to report before we would
be allowed to enter Ortez. On the way
we heard regular infantry firing on our
left and we knew an engagement was
going on; in fact, when we reached the
i fort they had commenced to bring in
the wounded. The next I heard of this
battle was in the United States, where
the statement was published that there
were some 3000 or 4000 .warriors en
gaged. The number of soldiers at La
Mesa could not have been oyer 50, and
no power on earth could have taken
them out against a tenth part of tho
I number of warriors named. It is per-
I fectly safe to assume that the same
sort "of exaggeration is being practiced
now, and I know it is as I know the
Yaquis cannot muster more than 500
warriors all told. They will put up a

troops will have no bloodless victory,

as thought, would result in Pret

as his right bower in the smuggling

Positive evidence against two guards
and another official, occupying a good
position, has been obtained and the only
reason why they have not been dis

charge is said to be a desire to pro

When Pretzel was mode acquainted
with the fact that he had been watched
closely for three weeks on suspicion of
opium smuggling, he was dumfounded.
"I have never tried to smuggle an

said, "and the knowledge that I am

to his having been driven around in
open carriages on the pretext of seeing
the mint and other places of interest
by ladies whose names are familiar in
the upper circles.
But this hero-worship of the stalwart
Matabele had almost run its course.
The scandal had begun to attract the
attention of the more level-headed
members of society. Disgusted, they
started to raise a storm of ridicule
which they hoped would soon end, to
put it very mildly, this very stupid
craze, not anticipating 1 that it would
end so melodramatically.
On Thursday the bride and bride
groom tried to get married at St.
Matthias' Church, Earlscourt, but thero
was a hitch. The clergyman, it is said,
would not perform the ceremony. He
asked whether Lobengnla was a Chris
tian and if he did not have some black
wives already.
It was all fixed up on Friday, how
ever, in a registry office, and the
strangely matched pair went off for
their honeymoon, en route, it is said,
and hoped, for South Africa. Society is
truly shocked. It is a lesson. If a sav
age chief ever comes here again for
show purposes ladies will probably be
more chary of drawing all eyes upon
them by making a hero of him. for they
are not likely to forget the Lobengula
romance.

SEATTLE, Aug. 12.â Judge Jacobs this
morning denied the application of Wil

for a writ of habeas corpus, and ordered
him returned to Chicago. He allowed an
appeal from his decision, however, and
gave the petitioner's attorney ten days
in which to perfect one. pending which
time he ordered the Sheriff of the county
to hold the prisoner.'
In passing on the case Judge Jacobs
took occasion to criticize the papers on
which it is- proposed to extradite the
prisoner. He said the original affidavit
filed against the defendant in the Justice
court was not a charge of a crime at all,
and was absolutely worthless. This dif
ficulty, however, was obviated by the in
dictment which was found Yfy the Grand
Jury. The certificate of authentication,
th'-Vourt said, was not so full as it might
be, but he did not consider the objec
tions sufficient to warrant the release of
the prisoner.
Armstrong's attorneys announced to the
court that an appeal from his decision
would be taken to the State Supreme
Court.

M'^'NTERET, Aug. 12.â Another repre- !
sentailve of the old regime in Californiaâ |
a man whose stanch adherence to the ,
former order of things has made the
; American California ways so distasteful
; that for many years he has lived the life
! of a recluseâ has passed away.
Jose Antonio Garcia was found lying
I dead in the woods near his home in the .
Upper (..'armel on Thursday afternoon.
i As considerable mystery surrounded the j
grewpome find, many believed there had j
: been foul play. Coroner H. V. Muller waa
i notified, and by his direction the body :
was brought to Monterey yesterday morn-
An inquest was held in the aftf-r
--: noon. The investigation showed that the
â  old man had heen ailing for some time,
having been subject to spasms and faint
: ing spells. Feeling better on Wednesday,
he had gone out into the woods to gather
' faggot?. Nothing more was seen of him
until his body was found the following
day. It is believed- the unwonted exertion
of gathering the faggots brought on an
attack of weakness, from which he could
1 not recover. The jury brought in a ver
dict of death from old age and exhaus
tion.
Garcia was a native Californian of
-h parentage and was prominent as
a fighter under General de Castro during
! the war between Mexico and the V
Si tes. He took a lending part with the
body of <"alifornians who besieged Gen-'
eral Fremont and his command in the
Gabilan Mountains just before the Ameri
can occupation of Monterey, and fought
i on the Mexican side* throughout the war.
I He was in his r-ighty-thlrd year when he
died and had lived tor nearly forty years
in a secluded cabin on the Upper
Carmel River. He had a son and daugh
ter living in Monterey, Mit could never be !
; induced to make his home with either of ;
, them. Ke rarely came to town during the

Thomas B. Reed, Senator W. J. Sewell

Daniel Frohman. A reporter tried to

not have much success.
"There is a rumor that you are going
back to Washington. Is it true?" asked
the reporter.
"Is there? Well, just now I'm going
up to Maine," said Mr. Reed.
The ex-Speaker was asked whether
he intended to become a resident of
New York, but he declined to answer
the question. He also declined to ex- j
press an opinion as to the result of the j
J'eace Conference at The Hague.
Mr. Croker was sorry the Mazet com
mittee had adjourned.
"I'd like them to keep right on," he
said. "They are making ten thousand
Democrats a day in New York city and
State and the longer they keep up the
good work the better it will be with the
party."
Mr. Croker refused to say anything
as to his plans. He did not know, he
said, whether he would go to Saratoga
to confer with the other Democrats
who are there or not.

Charge of Bribery Is
Dismissed.
TIME PROVES HIS FRIEND
STATUTE OF LIMITATION PRE

Gregory Faction in Round Valley De
clares That It Is in Possession of
Positive Proof of His
Guilt.
Pr*clal Dispatch to The Call.
COVELO, Aug. 12.â Frank Hanover,
! the alleged perjurer and briber in the
trial of the Littlefleld lynchers, was dis
charged this morning on motion of the
prosecution on the ground that the
action was barred by the statute of
limitation. Vigorous protestations by
the defense were overruled and Hano
ver was dismissed.
The friends of Gregory, now serving a
, twenty-year sentence for complicity in
the lynching, feel deeply disappointed,
and declare that but for the bar of lim
itation Hanover would be held to an
swer to the charge of bribery. The affi
davits in the hands of Brophy are, they
1 insist, strong proof of the guilt of Han
over. In the affidavits of George, Grant
and John Cooper and May Cooper,
sworn to before Justice of the Peace
Snelling of Paskenta, Tehama County,
-it is declared that Hanover offered
them $40 to swear against Gregory.
Robert Henecker of 117 Steuart street,
San Francisco, deposes that he heard
Hanover attempting to bribe a certain
person in Covplo. The person's name
is purposely withheld, as his testimony
will be used in the coming trial of Hay
den and Radcliffe.
E. G. Reed, an attorney of promi
nence and now residing at Redding, is
charged with having attempted to
suborn the perjured testimony of sev
eral witnesses, assuring them that if
they would give the kind of evidence
wanted by Deputy Attorney General
Post all the men would be cleared, ex
cepting Gregory and Crow. Reed was
1 the attorney for Van Horn and Crow
at the first trial.
Former Deputy Sheriff Bnx of Trin
ity County is another man that is ac-

GENERAL SEAMANS
INDULGES IN POLITICS
Prison Directors Read a Letter From
the National Guardsman to
Warden Aguirre.
FAN QUENTIN PRISON, Aug. 12.â
1 W. H. Keamans, adjutant general of the
I National Guard, is not averse to doing
I a little politics, even in his official ca
! pacity, a fact illustrated by a letter
from him to Warden Aguirre, which
was read at to-day's session of the !
Board of State Prison Directors. The I
; letter afforded the board a good deal of
i amusement.
The Warden deems It expedient to
' purchase a Gatling gun for the new
I guard post to be erected in place of
j the old liberty post, and with that end
jin view has been in communication
â with the Oakland Iron Works. Finding
it necessary to wait some time before
.: Gatllng gun could be purchased,'
i Aguirre wrote to Adjutant General â¢
Seamans, and asked if the National '
Guard could not loan one to the prison
i authorities until a new gun could be
! bought. In response, Seamans stated
in his official capacity, that he would
] see if such a thing were possible. He
invited Aguirre to call upon him for a
j favor at any time, and in conclusion
said:
"By the way, do you think you
could find a place down there for an
ex-Unipn Boldiler â an honest, able-bod
| led man, competent to meet, all require
ments? I would like to hear from you
as soon as convenient."
The board decided to put two bath
houses in the prison yard at a cost of
$1000.
Leon Dennerv appeared before the
board and asked for a parole for Her
man Cohen, who has one and a half
years to serve on a six-year sentence
for an assault to murder in San Fran
cisco. Action was postponed until the
next meeting.
OBJECT TO LADY

Broken.
LONDON, Aug. 12.â The engagement
of Lady Randolph Churchill to young
Lieutenant L. G. M. Cornwallis-West,
brother of the Princess of Pless, Is
meeting with the most violent opposi
tion. The Marlborough family Is quite
furious at her, while Lieutenant Corn
wallie-West'fl family is denying the en
gagement everywhere and has out Lady
â Randolph Churchill dead. All Influence
is being brought to bear in the matter.
The Prince of Wales even went tn see
the Cornwall}*- Wests, . especially to
talk It over, and h*Â» also spoke to Lady
Randolph Churchill on the subject.
But, nevertheless, the engagement has
not yet been broken off.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
SANTA BARBARA, Aug. 12.â The
trial of Lady Frances Broome was
called to-day and at 6 o'clock to-night
j the last of the twelve jurors was sworn.
â  Lady Broome is charged with having
resisted and interfered with an officer
in the discharge of his duty. Early
last April the City Council ordered the
City Marshal to remove a hedgr**, which,
according to the survey of the City Sur
veyor, was in the street, and which
Mrs. Broome insisted was on her prop
erty, according to an older survey.
This hedge Lady Broome had refused
to remove, nor would she allow, any
one else to remove it, threatening to
I carry the contest to the United States
, courts, which right she had as a Brit
ish subject.
On April 13 the Marshal and several
! deputies went to the place and
i proceeded to remove the obstruc
tions. Lady Broome and her gardener,
a Spaniard named Valenzula, stood
guard, ready to offer resistance. She
ordered them off her property, and
when they refused to move she picked
up a pickax and struck Walter Rich
ardson, a deputy, and th^n made a rush
j at Marshal Martin, striking him also.
; She and her gardener were put under
! arrest and taken to the City Jail. Bail
1 was offered her, but she refused to take
lit or to consult an attorney. She was
locked in the tanks for a few hours
1 and finally was allowed to go on hex
own recognizance. She refused to pro
'â  cure counsel until this trial. Judge
Crowley of San Francisco is defending
, her. She maintained that all the local
; attorneys were prejudiced against her.
I She was accompanied in court to-day
by Ellwood Cooper.

BERLIN, Aug. 12.â The Diet reas
sembles on August 16. Prince Yon Ho
henlohe, the Imperial Chancellor, and
Dr. Yon Miquel, Vice President <rf the
Council and Minister of Finance, will
return to attend the sessions, which will
decide the fate of the canal bill, and
will throw the combined weight of their
influence in favor of the measure. The
Government hopes the bill will pass
by a sufficient majority, especially
since Emperor William took occasion
at the opening of the Dortmund-Ems
canal to emphasize again the great
need of such a new network of com
munication. The ceremonies at the
opening of the canal yesterday were
quite imposing, and were intended to
mark the importance of the new water
way. The canal is 270 kilometers long,
over S feet deep and 95 feet wide at the
top and 57 feet wide at the bottom. It
will enable vessels of 900 tons to go di
rect from the Baltic. Bremen and Ham
burg to the new Dortmund harbor,
where they can discharge their cargoes
150 kilometers inland.
Germany's relations with Austria-
Hungary are the theme of much news
paper comment this week. The fact
that Prince Yon Hohenlohe, contrary
to custom, since he became Chancellor,
has not met Count Goluchowski, the
Austro-Hungarian Foreign Minister,
this year to talk over the "policy of the
two empires," and the further fact that
Emperor Francis Joseph in passing
through Aussee did not find time to get
off the train to welcome the German
Chancellor, but contented himself with
hurriedly greeting the Chancellor from
the car and chatted with him only
seven minutes, are regarded in political
circles as proof that the relations be
tween Germany and Austria-Hungary,
despite the continuing of the nominal
alliance, have ceased to be really inti
mate.
Newspaper comment and popular
feeling: throughout Germany have been
for some time most bitter because of
the growing Slavic ascendency in Aus
tria-Hungary. It is asserted that Em
peror William shares this view, fcince
the persecution of the German element
has become part of the settled system.
A large and influential portion of r.he
press this week has reiterated these
sentiments, and the Government organs
do not confirm or deny the foregoing
statements. Several facts have come
to the surface which tend in the direc
tion indicated. Thus, the Prussian
Government has forbidden the lengthy
stay, and especially in the frontier dis
tricts, of Czechs and other Austrian
Slavs. The Austrian press protests
against this measure. The Saxon Min
istry of the Interior has issued a decree
that all communications sent to Hun
gary must bear only the German names
of the towns to which they are srent.
To this the Hungarian press strongly
demurs, and is also much stirred lip
over the sending of Emperor William's
court chaplain, Rogge, to unveil the
German monument at Hermannstadt.
The ceremony is regarded as a protest
against the Magyarization movement in
Hungary.
Samoa is still occupying a good deal
of attention, and the press is full Of
comment, the bulk of the criticism.
however, being directed against Ener
land. The mouthpiece of the agrarians,
the Deutsche Tages Zeitung, in a bitter
lal charges both England and the
I'nited States with showing systematic
animosity toward Germany in the Sa
fnoan muddle from beginning to end;
attacks the Foreign office for yielding
every point to these powers, and says
it would have been wiser to renew from
the start all claims to Samoa and to
have insisted upon equivalents else
where. The < 'olopne Gazette, however,
in an inspired article, ridicules the no
tion thnt Germany is making enemies
of all the powers over trifling differ
ences. The paper claims that the agrar
ians stir up trouble with the United
States In order to render impossible
the conclusion of commercial treaties,
and this for their own selfish ends.
From semi-official reports it appears
that the German claims for property
destroyed in Samoa during the troubles
are not nearly so large as hitherto be
lieved, namely 800,000 marks.
Thf recent utterances of Baron yon
Stengel of the Munich University, who
was second 1b rank in Germany's dele
gation at the peace conference regard
ing The Hague gathering, are almost
unanimously disapproved in Germany.
The National Zeitung say 3 Baron yon
Stengel's private views are his own and
must not be confounded with the views
of the Government.
The sending of delegates and models
to the Philadelphia exhibition has been
discussed warmly in the press this
week. A number of chambers of com
merce of the Rhenish provinces.
Brandenburg and Saxony decline to
participate, as have also a number of
prominent merchants. The argument
mostly is that participation means the
fostering: of American competition. The
Government, however, takes a differ
ent view and has taken pains to make
it public. The Liberal press mostly as
sumes a friendly attitude.
The elevation of Count yon Munster-
Ledenburg. the German Embassador to
France, to the rank and title of Prinze
yon der Herburg. is attributed gener
ally to his patient and successful en
deavors to render the relations between
Germany and France gradually more
pleasant. Most of the papers approve
of the award. The Vorwaerts alone
says the time for the promotion was
unhappily chosen, since it comes in
the midst of the Dreyfus trial,
and the anti-revisionist press will
will make it the occasion of new
Chauvinistic calumnies and charges
and the even-tenor of Justic may there
by be Impeded. A clear sign of the im
proved Franco-German relations Is
found in the fact that the committee of
German and French *rmy officers is
now engaged in the geodetical meas
urements of the frontier for the pur
pnp,-Â» of bringing the official measure
ment of both countries into complete
accord.
A duel hetween two officer? of th-
TVnth T'hlan Regiment. Count Solms

jealoury. Both the participants were

SAD FINALE TO MRS.
SHAW'S PINK TEA
THE GUESTS CARTED OFF IN THE
PATROL WAGON.
The I/ady Was Simply Celebrating on
Her Eight-Year-Old Daughter's
Pickle-Factory Earnings.
Mrs. Helen Shaw, who lives at 2*l Ship
ley street, gave a pink tea to her neigh
bors last night, a record of which will be
found in the annals .of the Police Court
instead of in the society columns of the
local papers.
The occasion marked a particularly im
portant event in the history of Shipley
street and the Shaw family. Ruby Shaw,
only S years old. had earned $1 50 laboring'
on a rush on tomatoes in a nearby picklÂ«
factory, and it was decided that the first
week's salary should be spent judiciously
and all in one placeâ Pat Meehan's corner
grocery.
Forthwith Mrs. Shaw sent broadcast
through the alley invitations to her Sat
urday night soiree. J. P. Harrigan. Kats
"White. Ed Hayes, Bruce Fleming and
Mrs. Fitzpatrick responded, and soon the
joyous occasion was on in full blast. Tha
spacious can made many visits to the cor
ner, and soon .Mrs. Shaw's guests, and in
cidentally herself, were gloriously char.sod,
with steam beer. The merriment scaled
to dizzy heights and the fruits of l'rtla
Ruby hard week's work in the pickl<j
factory withered apace.
Mrs. Shaw's function pursued the even
tenor of its way until Bucco Fleming ac
cused Ed Hayes of treating the policeman
on the beat during one of his frequent
trips to the corner saloon. Hayes resent
ed Burro's cruel insinuation, and soon the
bunch were writhing in the throes of a
Shipley street ruction. At this junctura
Policeman Hurley burst upon the scera
and carted Mrs. Shaw and her guests to
the City Prison in the patrol wagon. Th*
women'were charged with cruelty to chil
dren and the men were booked for dis
turbing the peace.

ARIONS OF THE EAST AND WESS MAKE
MERRY WISH SPEECH AND SONG
THE visiting Arions from New
York have tasted trie sweets of
San Francisco's hospitality, and
they are delighted with its flavor
and amazed at Its abundance. As
President Weihacht said in his address
at the Arion Jinks last night:
"We knew thi I I California were
big, and we knew that I â  J and
of the Golden State were big. and
now we know that the hearts <>t" the peo
ple of the Pacific Coast are the biggest in
the country. "
But the sweet singers from the Eastern
metropolis have only "tasted" the good
things prepared for their entertainment
by their namesakes of the Western me
tropolis, and by the time they depart on
their long homeward journey, short
though the time be, they will have a
faint appreciation of what the Califor
nlans, and especially the German citizens
of California, are capable of in the way
of extending hospitable welcome to their
guests. Yesterday morning and afternoon
the Gothamltes rested after their Jour
ney to prepare themselves for the high
Jinks given In their honor in Odd Fel
lows' Hall last evening. That la to say,
they were supposed to rest, hut while
they were not called upon to undergo any
physical exertion, they were kept fairly
busy viewing the fights and scenes In
and around San Francisco from carriages
provided by their hosts. They went
everywhere and they saw everything,
and "when they returned to tbeir hotel
the* were ready to acknowledge, and did
acknowledge with true German frank
ness and enthusiasm, that San Francisco
b without a peer in these United States.
Hut the feature of ihe day's programme
came at night. Odd Fellows" Hall had
beer, decorated for the reception of the
visiting Arions In a manner never before
attempted. Under the skillful direction
of E. A. Otto it had been converted Into
a veritable bower, gay bunting and col
ored lanterns adding to the effect produced
by masses of flowers and palms. The
long tables were strewn with grape and
hop vines, with an occasional bouquet of
flowers, while at the front of the stage
was a magnificent Moral harp, the em
blem â >: the two societies.
President Plagemann of the San Fran
cis Arions, in welcoming the guests
from the East, said he was proud of the
fact that he was the first to have that
honor. He declared that the New York
Arions were the greatest organization of
the kind in the united States and their
San Francisco brethren hoped to occupy
a position on this coast similar to that
ho grandly filled by them In the East. In
conclusion he said the local Arions would
try to make it pleasant for their guests
during their brief stay.
To Fritz Beringer of St. Helena was ac
corded the honor of a genuine ovation. He
has been a resident of California since
1884 but before he departed from New
York for the wild and woolly West he had
been for thirteen years president of the
New York society. He was called upon
for a speech and he managed to get
through with a brief address with con
siderable difficulty owing to the applause
and when he took his seat he was given
three cheers ana a tiger. President Wel
nacht of the visiting society, who spoke
next devoted the major portion of his
address to a eulogy of Mr. Beringer. to
whose untiring efforts, he said, the suc
cess achieved by the New York Arions
was mr:ir.ly due. â¢ "
"I car not find words to express my
rratitude and thanks for the magnificent |
reception you have given uk in your beau
tiful city." said Mr. Weinacht. "We have
been j leased with many things since we
arrlvd in San Francisco and a sweet re
membrance of old times came over us
when Fritz Beringer spoke. The success ;
that has attended our society has come j
largely through his great work and one
of our first and greatest pleasures since !
arriving in the State was seeing our old I
president once again. We are proud of j
__J__^_^^THE EMPORIUM. |
! being the first traveling singing society
j to come from the East to the extreme
West. As we were the first to go to G< r
! many from this country so are we the
: pioneers of all societies who may come
after us to the Pacific Coast.
"The farther west we came the greater
were the surprises we met with and the
greatest surprise of all was the splendid
reception we have met with in California.
, In California not only are the trees big
ger, the flowers and fruits bigger, but
the hearts of the people are* bigger than
j anywhere else In the Unietd States or in
i the world."
Mayor Phelan was the last regular
' speaker on the programme, and the only
i one to speak in English. He welcomed the
1 visiting Arions to the city in a few brief
words, complimenting them as a society
on the great success they have achieved,
and in closing declared that the people of
California were particularly susceptible to
music and melody.
"For," said he, the people, the skies,
the landscape and the ocean are all in
harmony here." ... , .
The addresses were all short, for the
gathering was one of a music-loving peo-

HOME OF THE VISITING ARIONS.
THE New York Arion Society is over forty years old. dating from 1554. Of
the charter members only two are livingâ George Ely and F. J. Adams â
neither of whom accompanied the excursionists. The membership now
numbers 1450. Music is the foundation of the Arions. From the first the
society aimed to promote melody and kindred matters of culture and
diversion and the purpose of the society's founders has been kept In mind by
their successors'. The home of the visiting Arionp is at the corner of Park ave
nue and Fifty-ninth street, in one of the most attractive buildings in New
York, which is the property of the society. The splendid structure includes a
concert hall and every possible accessory for the entertainment of its members.
Tt was built in 18S7 and represents an investment of more than half a million
dollars.

LYNCHINGS IN THE SOUTH-
OL'T of the fearful lynchings which have fol
lowed one another with such rapidity in the
South of late there has come at least one good
result. The appalling nature of some of these ter
rible offenses against law and humanity has startled
the intelligence of the Southern people with a fear
their States may be drifting back to barbari-m. and
from the Potomac to the Rio Grande the more
earnest leaders, white and black, are busily engaged
in discussing the evil, with a view to finding some
prompt and adequate remedy.
It i.Â» significant of the earnestness of the new phase
of the discussion that lynching is no longer justified
md on the ground that it is the natural and
proper retaliation of the white man upon the negro
who assaults a white woman. The Southern people
are now aware the toleration shown to lynchers in
cases of that kind has prompted the lawless and
rowdy element in the South to resort to it on almost
eny kind of provocation, and to carry it to the ex
treme of savage cruelty. As a consequence the plea
in defense of lynching is but little heard of late. It
is now almost universally conceded to be an evil, and
the trend of the debate is toward devising means for
its suppression.
Many of the leading men among the negroes have
given up the problem in flat despair. At a recent
meeting of the council of elders of the African Metho
dist Episcopal church of Georgia and Alabama a
resolution was adopted setting forth the deplorable
condition of the negroes in the Southern States, and
a committee was appointed to petition Congress to
appropriate $100,000,000 to subsidize a line of steam
ships between the United States and Africa to facili
tate negro emigration to that continent.
The whites are naturally more hopeful. It is not
in the nature of the American white man to despair
in thejace of any kind of governmental problem. It
is asserted by some of the speakers and the writers
on the subject that the practice of lynching has
sprung up in the South largely because of the law's
delay and the inefficiency of the courts. An elab
orate array of statistics has been published in leading
Southern papers showing that of the number of per
sons indicted for murder comparatively few are con
victed, and the conclusion is drawn that the people
resort to lynching in the case of great crimes because
they have no confidence in the courts.
At a recent meeting of the Georgia Chautauqua
Society at Barnesville the Hon. Dupont Guerry of
Macon disputed the charge made against the courts
and declared: "Those who have so much to say
about legal technicalities are either demagogues or
ignoramuses who do not know a technicality from a
great constitutional provision." Mr. Guerry argued,
however, that since it is clear the people demand a
swifter process of law, it would be better to provide
ir than to suhnit to the alternative of lynching.
By way ofHjringing the issue in a definite form be
fore the people the speaker submitted the outlines of
a bill providing for prompt justice. According to
the Atlanta Constitution, the bill continues the or
ganization of the .Grand Jury from one term to
another, makes it a conservator of the peace, and re
fitiires it to serve at called term? of court; provider
that witnesses may be summoned at once to attend
c.lied terms, and for appointment of counsel in ad
vance and for trial at that term if parties can get
ready: provides for immediate hearing of motion of
new trial, immediate bill of exceptions, and imme
diate hearing in Supreme Court.
A bill of the kind providing for what may be called
a "shortcut" trial in times of popular excitement may
not be as good as the safeguarded trials to which we
are accustomed, but it is better than lynch law. It
is to be hoped the Georgians will try it. Certainly
some organization is needed to conserve the peace
and promote good order in the lynch-ridden coun
ties of the State, and a Grand Jury might well be as
signed the task.
JUST ONE KICKER r-*r-t
HIGH hopes have been entertained that in the
preparations made for the reception of the Cali
fornia Volunteers on their return from the Phil
ippines there would be such universal harmony that
from first to last the proceedings would be marred
by no word of wrangling, fault-finding or protesting.
The hope was natural, but was too high for a com
plete fulfillment. The general satisfaction has not in
cluded all the people. One voice has been lifted in
protest against the prevailing enthusiasm. It is but
a single voice, but the noise of it disturbs the har
mony even as the bray of an ass sounding from a
field would jar and mar the fullest chorus ever poured
from human throats.
The coniplainer is the Fresno Democrat, and the
cause of his bray is the movement to have the day of j
the reception of the returning heroes set apart as a
public holiday, so that the working people may have
full freedom to take part in the festivities. The
braying runs thus: "The San Francisco papers are;
now urging that the Governor declare a dies non on
the day that the First California Regiment arrives at
home.' This legal holiday business is being run into
the ground in California. Why should business be
suspended all over the State simply to give San
Francisco a legal holiday? Business will be prac
tically suspended on that day in San Francisco if one
half that is proposed to be done in the welcoming of
the San Franciscans is done, but why should the
State have in consequence to suffer the inconvenience
of having the courts closed, banking and commercial
alTairs stopped and all legal business suspended.''"
A more senseless protest against the patriotic im- I
pulses of a people has never been written. Legal
holidays have not been "run into the ground" in Cali
fornia. Our holidays are few, and even of the few ]
many are not adequately observed. It is probable j
that Californians take less recreation than any other
people. Our climate is such that work can be car
ried on with vigor at all seasons of the year, and we
keep continuously at it. We have not the long win
ter rest or the long summer repose of the East. \\ c
are driving forward at high pressure all the time.
An additional holiday added to the list of this year
would be a benefit even if it were taken solely for re- j
cieation, and it is certainly commendable when taken
for the purpose of welcoming home the heroic sons
of California who are coming back to us from a war !
on the other side of the globe, a war in which they
have been victorious, in which they have not only
distinguished themselves but have reflected glory |
upon the State.
It is to be regretted that even a single Californian
has been found wanting in sympathy with the en
thusiasm of the people in this movement, but there
â  ie satisfaction in knowing there is only one. The
bray has been heard, and now the glad chorus can go
on as if it had never been uttered.
Recent reports from Guatemala indicate that Presi
e'ent Cabrera has ordered the assassination of many
of his worthy subjects. He may rind himself some fine
morning in the predicament that ended the careers of

the muzzle of a gun.
The storm king is exercising over Porto Rico and
Cuba a devastating power of which Spain had no sus

wards as Spain would have been.
THE RIGHTS OF AUTHORS.
A MOVEMENT has been started among literary
people in New York to have the copyright law
amended by Congress in order that writers may
enjoy the fruits of their labor in perpetuity. Under
the present law it is possible fur the rights of a book
to lapse and become public property in the life of the J
writer. A petition to Congress has been prepared and
circulated by Margaret Lee, and many writers and
literary persons have signed it.
In their argument for the desired amendment the
petitioners say: "In Russia copyright exists during
an author's life, twenty-five years after his death and
ten years in addition if an euition of his works is pub
lished within five years of the end of the term: in
Spain, during the author's life and fifty years there
! after; in Germany, for the author's life and thirty
years thereafter; in France, during the author's life
and fifty years thereafter. We demand that the
: United States shall at once take the foremost position
'â  and make copyright perpetual. The reason of the law
is the life of the law; the reason 'for the putting of any
! restriction on the life of the copyright having disap
â  peared, the limitation should cease, and the right of
the author in his work should be perpetual."
No valid argument can be urged against the per
petual copyright asked for in the petition. If a man
use the profits of his labor to buy land the Govern
ment secures the title forever to him and to his heirs
until either he or they sell it. If another man employ
his labor in producing a book he is justly entitled to
as full possession of the property as is given to the
; land-owner. Reasons of public expediency require
that perpetual patents should not be given to invent
ors, for improvements in mechanism affect widespread
industries, and a monopoly of an improvement in
machinery would in some cases amount to a monopoly
of the industry, but no such objection stands against
perpetual copyright for authors.
It is not at all likely the movement will make much
headway until after a prolonged agitation, for the op
position to it will be strong, but it is none the less
i worth while for authors to begin the contest for what
is undoubtedly a natural right. It required many
: years to bring about the arrangement fur an interna
tional copyright between this country and Great
Britain, but in the end the authors were successful.
An earnest and united effort for perpetual copyright
may have a similar history. The literary men of this
generation will hardly profit by it, but they may have
the satisfaction of winning a recognition of the rights
of those who are to follow them.

MUCH ODO ABOUT NOTHING.
O['R Eastern contemporaries are as busily dis
cussing the outlook of the Democratic party
as if it were a matter of concern to the nation.
The signs of the skies visible along the distant hori
zon are interpreted variously. Some gazers perceive
in them evidences that Bryanism is declining, others
see proofs that Bryanism is growing in strength. A
ronsideiable number assert the remonetization of sil-
ver will be the issue in iooo, as it was in the last Presi
dential campaign, while many are convinced the party
will seek new leaders and new issues.
The action of the Maryland Democrats in ignoring
i the money question in their State platform this year
jis taken as a proof that those who are opposed to a
THE.SAX FRANCISCO CALL,, SUNDAY, AUGUST 13, 1899.
-teÂ«etij;ion of the blunder of '96 will be able to shape
the policy of the party next year. The fact that a gold
Democrat has been nominated for Governor in Ken
tucky is also pointed out as another evidence that the
old Bryanite fervor is giving place to a return of com
mon sense.
It is of course well understood the elimination of
free silver from the contest next year means the de
feat of Bryan for renomination. His candidacy would
make the money question the predominant issue in the
minds of the business elements of the people despite
every -ffoit that could be made by himself or by his
party to set it aside. He is as fully identified with the
silver craze as McKinley with the tariff, and the in- j
telligence of the country will never trust him in a j
position where his power can in any way affect the j
finances of the nation.
That much is generally understood and agreed by
all the political experts who are now considering the 1
future of Democracy. There is confusion, however,
in the discussion as to what issue with the administra
tion the Democrats could raise if the money question
be set aside. It will be impossible to raise an issue on
the subject of trusts, because the Republican party is
not responsible for the existence of trusts and is as
much opposed to their objectionable features as any
Democrat can be. Neither is it at all likely any suc
cess can be gained in arraying Democracy against th?
war policy of the administration, for on that issue
Democracy is divided against itself.
The whole subject is of no more than speculative
interest. It can hardly be called a matter of national j
concern. Whether the party cling to Bryan or turn
from him, whether it fight trusts or ignore them,
whether it denounce the foreign policy of the ad
ministration or not, will matter little. It is as certain
as anything in the future can be that McKinley will
be re-elected. All debates concerning the probable
course of the Democratic party on national issues will
for some time to come be but much ado about noth
ing. Until it has been purged not of Bryan only but
of all the leaders who have made his supreme leader
ship possible there will be nothing for it in each
Presidential contest but to go forth, as Colonel
Watterson ence said, "to a march through a
slaughter-house to an open grave."
Apparently it is only necessary to cross a river in
the Philippines to find oblivion. The fact that Fun
Â«icn has not been heard of since the action for which
he received his promotion recalls the other fact that
Hully Gee Otis has dropped clear out of sight since
he crossed the Rubicon on a cablegram.
THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF GOOD
CITIZENS.
GOVERNOR ROOSEVELT, in an address be
fore the summer school of Ocean Grove, N. ]Â
gave to the cultured audience that gathered to
hear him a plain talk on their political duties and the
extent to which they are responsible for the short
comings of government, whether of the nation, the
State or the city.
It is idle, said the Governor, for a class of people
calling themselves "good citizens" to try to set them
selves apart from politics, for in a country such as
ours the political life must in the long run correspond
to the social and the business life. In the end our
politicians must be exactly what the people allow them
to be. They must represent the people â perhaps the
virtue, perhaps the vice, perhaps the indifference of
the people.
To those would-be reformers who think they are
really doing something for Teform by mere denun
ciations of politicians this plain statement was di
rected: "In blaming the bad politician do not forget
that we are ourselves to blame for permitting his ex
istence. Again, do not let us fall into the mistake of
thinking that we shall ever make politics better by
hysterics in any shape or form. Windy denunciation
of all politicians, good and bad. is the very thing most
advantageous to the bad politician, because such de
nunciation being one-half fahe loses all practical
effect, as it is impossible to separate the true from the
false."
That the intelligence of San Francisco has learned
the lesson Roosevelt undertook to teach at Ocean
Grove has been proven by the results of the recent
primaries. There remains, however, the danger that
the people may not continue to live up to the stan
dard of civic patriotism illustrated in that contest. If
the good citizens who triumphed on that day should
now sit down contented with their victory it is safe
to say the defeated bosses would soon rally their
strength and devise some means of getting back at
least a part of their former power in the municipal
government.
The fight for good government in San Francisco
did not end with the primary elections, notwithstand
ing the completeness of that victory over bosses and
the yellow journal. It will go on until the polls close
on election day. The gangs of spoilsmen who seek to
use the municipal government for their own profit are
tireless workers, ceaseless plotters, and have a cunning
that for some purposes serves almost as well as wis
dom. Against their efforts the intelligence of the peo
ple must be always on guard.
Alexander McDonald, the "Klondike king," seems
to be overwhelmed with distress because in one year
he accumulated liabilities aggregating $6,000,000.
Most people would consider themselves almost
miraculously fortunate to get their fellows to loan
them that amount in a lifetime.
The Yaqui Indians are inspired by a belief that un
der the guidance of the strange Santa Teresa they are
to journey to heaven. The military activity of the
Mexican Government already indicates that the trip
will be fulry as interesting but in another direction.
Dispatches from Havana contain the information
that General Jiminez, the revolutionary aspirant to the
Presidency of San Domingo, has sent an agent to
New York. Pending further advices, it is safe to as
sume that he sent a press agent.
The dispatches declare that a devastating hail storm
absolutely "cleaned" a strip of land twelve miles wide.
The farmers in that part of the country are likely to
change that ancient remark that cleanliness is next to
godliness.

As the Boston Globe, a contemporary
very much esteemed for reliability,
vouches for this story, I accept it as it
stands and with alacrity pass it along:
A committee of the Selectmen of Tyngs
boro, Mass., appointed to inquire Into
the cause of a somewhat mysterious
fire in the town, found reason for be
lieving it was caused by lightning. It
is not the custom in Massachusetts to
let disasters pass as accidental nor to
excuse offenders however high their
station, so the committee reported that
this particular fire was due to "the
carelessness of the Lord."
* â¢ 'â¢
When Boswell in his "Life of Samuel
Johnson" set.the fashion of searching
out everything that can be learned of
the doings of a famous man and pub
lishing it, he was said by a wit of the
time to have added a new terror to
death. Dr. Johnson himself felt the
terror, for he once said: "If I knew
Boswell intends to write my life I'd
take his."
Colonel Ingersoll is the latest sufferer
from the practice, and it is safe to say
if he had known what his fool friends
were going to do after his death he
would have killed them before he died.
Some of them have actually sought out
from old newspapers the verses written
in early manhood by the gifted orator
and republished them as evidence that
he might have been a poet if he hadn't
preferred to be something else.
In doing this Ingersoll's friends have
given Moses a means of attaining a
sweet revenge should he happen to meet
his lampooner in the Elysian fields.
"You were very merry on earth over
my mistakes," Moses will say, blandly,
"but you must concede I never made
the mistake of writing such poetry as
you have done, nor of making such
friends."
The written oratory of Ingersoll at
tests his ability to infuse prose with
harmonies of rhythm almost equal to
the perfection of music, and to niake
the sound of his sentences accord so
fully with the sentiment expressed in
them that, whether grave or gay, lively
or severe, the melody of the cadences
added to the impressiveness of the
thought. It is strange, therefore, that
in' undertaking poetry he fniled utterly.
Such, however, was the fact. The mo
ment he placed his free-flowing words
under the restrictions of verse he lost
his eunninpc and his grace, and he who
in prose moved so swimmingly along no
sooner ventured upon poetry than he
waddled like a duck out of water.
It Is not worth while to quote the
whole of one of Ingersoll's poems to
show what doggerel they are. A few
verses will suffice. Here are some from
a poem published years ago In tho
Greenville (111.) Journal and entitled:
THE WAVY WEST.
Bright, wavy, flow'ry lake.
Where grassy waves in stillness ride,
A wild, unbounded, living tide.
When breezes softly wake.
Where dark-haired Indian girls.
Reclining on thy dewy breast.
In morning dew and sunlight dressed,
Adorned with dewy pearls,
First felt the tender flame â
Saw lover's lips in rapture move;
And felt the trembling beat of love
Thrill wildly o'er their frame. I
See the flower in beauty's ray.
O'er its native sweet* exulting:
But the blast In wtldness sweeping:.
Bears its native sweets away.
See it lone and bleedinr lay,
Anil o'er its petals softly weep,
Till death comes o'er like gentle sleep;
Thus those lovers passed away.
â¢ * â¢
Lest it be thought unfair to cite Tn
i person's youthful indiscretions in verse
as conclusive proof he could not
j write verse at all, I submit two verses
/rom his latest poem, written shortly
before his death, and entitled "The De
claration of the Free." One stanza runs
thus:
We have no falsehoods to defendâ
We want the facts;
Our force, our thought, we do not spend
In vain attacks.
And we will never maanly try
To save some fair and pleaslne lie.
That may be accounted a pretty fair
jingle by those who "want the facts,"
! and Ingersoll was always in want of
i facts; but it is not poetry nor within
a measurable distance of poetry.
Here's another burst, or "bust," from
j the same screed:
We will not willingly be fooled
By fables nursed; ' 'i ~ I
Our hearts by earnest thought are schooled
To bear the worst;
And we can stand erect and dare
All thlnss, all facts that really are.
â¢ â¢ â¢
"With blank verse, being freed from
the necessity of rhyme, and freeing
himself from the metrical laws of po
etry, Ingersoll was more successful
than with other verse, but not much.
We have a specimen of it in lines writ
ten upon the back of a photograph
given to his daughter, and which are
believed to be the last words he wrote:
Immortality,
With its countless hopes ana rears beating
aaralnst the shores of time and faith,
Wils Dot born of any book, nor of any creed,
nor of any religion.
It was horn of human affection, and It will
continue to ebb and flow
Beneath the mists and clouds of doubt and
darkness as lone as love kisses the lips of
death. . .
It Is the rainbow hope, shining: on the tears of
crlef.
Of such character are the poetic re
mains of Robert Ingersoll, and as they
are doomed to die anyhow the true
friends of his fame will wish these re
mains had been incinerated with all the
rest of him that was mortal.
Â» â¢ Â«
It is surely unnecessary to quote any
specimen of Ingersoll's prose to show
how widely its rippling or thundering
cadences, rolling along in untrammeled
freedom and force, differed from his
halting verse. Still it is worth while to
furnish a specimen to bring the con
trast impressively to the mind, and the
following passage is interesting not
only as an illustration of his style but
as a statement of what he aimed to
accomplish in oratory. It is taken from
the Westminster Gazette, and as it oc
curs in the course of some observations
made upon public speaking in America
and Great Britain, it is perhaps a spec
imen of his conversational rather than
his oratorical style; but it will serve my
purpose and be more interesting to tho
general reader than the well-worn quo
tations from famous speeches with
which all are familiar.
He is quoted as having: said: "There
is no difference between the real Eng
lish and the real American orator. Ora
tory is the same the world over. Tho
man who thinks on his feet, who has
the pose of passion, the face that
thought illumines, a v^ice in harmony
with the ideals expressed; who has
logic like a column and poetry like a
vine; who transfigures the common,
dresses the ideals of the people in
purple and fine linen; who has the art
of finding the best and noblest in his
hearers, and who in a thousand ways
creates the climate in which the best
grows and flourishes and bursts into
blossomâ that man is an orator, no
matter of what time or what country."
That Ingersoll's oratory fell a long
way short of the standard he set up
goes without saying. No man attains
his ideal in anything unless he be a
base man whose Ideals are base. Nor
does it matter much, for, after all, the
true life of man is spiritual, not physi
cal; In the thought and the aim, not in
the action and the attainment. Inger
soll aimed at a lofty oratory, and if in
his desire to gain applause from his au
diences he paid more attention to the
vine of rhetoric than to the column of
logic, dressed very commonplace ideas
in the purple of gorgeous words, and
not infrequently appealed to what is
lowest and meanest in men rather than
to what is noblest, he is to be forgiven
âpartly because we need to be forgiven
much ourselves, partly because he is
dead and will do it no more, but mainly
because he stuck to what was best In
himself and rarely wrote poetry.
Senator Chauncey Depew. who has
long been regarded as one of (.he most
genial as well as one of the most effect
ive of after-dinner orators, has recently
declared that to make a hit with a
speech to men who are well lined with
a good dinner and desire to top off with
a feast of reason and flow of soul It is
"absolutely essential to leave some
body's hide on the fence."
Such a statement from that source Is
surprising, for Mr. Depew has the repu
tation of leaving nothing on the fence
but chestnut burrs. The truth of it,
however, is not to be disputed. A Sher
idan, indeed, may achieve triumphs,
"though his wit in the combat, as gentle
as bright, never carries a heart-stain
away on its blade"; but the average
speaker can never please a crowd un
less he takes the hide off a neighbor.
Most men, indeed, are so fond of seeing
somebody else hided that almost every
man who practices the art of taking the
hide off is generally regarded as a wit.
Yet it should not be so. As a matter
of fact it requires more wit and more
imagination to say complimentary
things about a neighbor or a companion
at a festal board, and cover the hide
of his reputation, than to strip him to
the bone and expose his skeleton.
It is to be hoped Senator Depew will
practice in the Senate what he has
preached for dinner parties. Since the
awakening of Ingalls from the irides
cent dream of political life there has
not been in the Senate one-half as
much of hide stripping as the people
desire. The Congressional Record has
become as dull as a comic weekly, and
there is no joy in it except for folks
who like statistics. If the fresh Sen
ator from New York will immediately
jrfpon the assembling of Congress pro
ceed to make a hit at Tillman of South
Carolina the gayety of the holidays will
be increased, whether the hide left on
the fence happen to be that of Tillman
or that of Depew.
Out of the discussions that in the
East have followed the exposure of bar
barities inflicted in the way of punish
ment upon the unfortunate inmates of
a girls 1 reform school in New Jersey
there has come one little gleam of hu
mor and of good. The trend of the dis
cussion is to determine the best means
of making refractory girls behave
themselves, and many children have
been invited to give their ideas on the
subject. One of them is quoted as say
ing: "I just love music, Jewsharps and
brass bands and organs and all kinds;
and when I'm very bad at home they
play me good. Yes. sir, it is just this
way: instead of punishing me they put
me on a sofa and play easy, soft mu
sic, and somehow It makes me gooder
and gooder."
On arriving at New York the other
day the passengers of the Campania
beheld upon the pier a vast concourse of
people and heard the strains of a brass
band blaring out: "See, the Conquering
Hero Comes." The passengers were
therefore aware that among their num
ber was one whom the American people
are proud to honor, so they lingered on
the deck, waiting to see him go ashore.
The first that walked down the gang
plank was Senator Wolcott, orator,
statesman, lawmaker, member of
the Bimetallic Commission. The peo
ple paid no attention to him. Then
followed Israel Zarigwill, novelist,
dramatist, lecturer and wit. Upon
him there pounced three reporters,
but the crowd let him pass un
noticed. Next along the gangplank
tripped Tod Sloan, the Incomparable
jockey, the victor of a hundred bril
liantly won races, but still the people
waited. All at once the band sent forth
louder and more triumphant strains,
the vast concourse of people waved hats
and handkerchiefs and canes, and
shouted as in a delirium of joy, for, be
holdâthey saw "Pedlar" Palmer.
Now, "Pedlar" Palmer is not a pedlar,
but a prize fighter, and he has come tc
this country to elevate pugilism. We
have thus an illustration of the trend
of public favor in the metropolis.
Statesmen, wits and race riders are as
nothing; they are lumped on a common
level and ignored when the fisticuff
man comes to town. Admiral Dewey
may account himself fortunate that he
is to reach New York in a ship of his
own and will not have to run the risk
of having his reception spoiled by the
simultaneous arrival of some "pug"
from Pugtown.

EXTRA SESSION ADVOCATES
DISPLAY GREAT ACTIVITY
Daylight Conference of Bosses at Crimmins' Saloon
to Round Up San Francisco Members
of the Legislature*
Rumors That Buckley and Burns Meet Kelly, Crimmins and Rainey
Excite "the Push' -Senators and Assemblymen
Interview Dibble,
EXTRA session advocates are
lining up for concerted ac
tion. The leaders of the
movement ar<- more confident
than ever before that Gov
ernor Gage will convene the Legislature
in special session. Judge Dibble has
i repared the proclamation, hut the
<;>>vernor. before signing it, may de
mand -that Senators and Assemblymen
to the number of sixty-one shall pledge
themselves in writing to elect a Sena
tor.
There was unusual activity among
the extra-sessionists yesterday. Politi
cians were excited by rumors of a con
fr-renee at Crimmins' saloon in which
Bosses Buckley, Kelly, Rainey, Crim
mins and Burns, according to the first
. participated.
The Call ascertained that Crimmins,
Kelly and Rainey exchanged views on
th<^ situation at the place mentioned,
but that Buckley and Burns were not
present when the roll of bosses was
called. About 3 o'clock in the afternoon
Judge Dibble interviewed Crimmins.
and subsequently Al Evans reported to
the Mexican at the elubrooms over
Gunst's store on Kearny street. The
politicians who are so strenuously ad
vocating an extra session were prompt
ly apprised of th<= conference at Crim
mins' place. The report that Buckley
attended the conference was erroneous.
us the blind boss was at his farm near
Livermore all day yesterday.
Senator Cutter of Marysville arrived
in the city yesterday afternoon and
dinfri with Judgre Dibble in the evening.
The S< nator was not prepared early
last night to impart his views regard
ing the proposed extra session. When
sounded on the subject he pave an an
swer which a court would not accept
as responsive t<> the question addressed
to him. The Senator told The Call that
he did not have the confidence of Gov
i rnor Gage and therefore was not able
t.. say whether an extra session would
be called.
T)iÂ»- Senator, when seen late last
evening, after he had met and discuss
politica with 1 "ibble, s.tid he
was of the impression that there
would certainly be an extra session.
Senator Cutter s:tys he is in this city
to have his teeth fixed and domes the
imputation that he is fcere to attend :i
But this the Senatoi will
admit, that ho has seen and talked
over the railing of an extra session
with many members of the Legislature.
and they all agree in the belief that
such a session will be held.
other members of the Legislature are
in the city and others still are coming,
to the delight of the dentists. Each
one will have a "heart-to-heart" talk
with Judge Dibble. The interviews
which take place at Dibble's law office
in the Mills' buildine relate to the sub
jecta which the proclamation shall em-
When a member from Shasta,
Tuolumne or Santa Barbara indicates
the measure of Legislation that is con
sidered most urgent by his constituents,
Judge Dibble signifies that the urgent
subject may be embodied in the proc
lamation for an extra session, provided
that no objection shall be interposed by
the county to the election of Burns.
3latorÃ who do not fall in line re
a hint that the proclamation will
not embrace subjects of vital impor
tance to their constituents.
Assemblymen C. W. Merritt of Santa
Barbara and J. H. Beecher of Shasta
are in town. Agents of the Southern
Pacific's political bureau made a tour
of the State recently and sought to as
certain the sentiment of interior mem
bers on the proposed extra session. No
doubt all the information obtained has
been conveyed to the Mexican. The
conference at rrimmins' saloon yester
day had reference, presumably, to the
necessity of rounding up the members
Of the San Francisco Republican dele
ration in the Legislature. As two of the
San Francisco Democrats in the legis
lative body receive orders from Rainey,
the presence of the last-named boss at
the conference is accounted for. In a
hard pinch Rainey could help the Mex
ican.
Gage comprfh^ndf that he would he
placed in a sorry plight before the peo
ple of the State if members called to
gether in extra session should wrangle
and create another deadlock over the
Senator* hi p. A session of two weeks
would coat a good, round sum of money.
A prolonged session would empty the
.:y and arouse the wrath of tax
payers/ The urgent business that the
railroad and the bosses have now in
hand. Is to convince Gage that the mem
bers when called together will obey
orders, elect a Senator and adjourn.
BUCKLEY AT WORK.
Blind Boss Rapidly Reorgan

In the roming Domocratic convention
Jasper McDonald has rrnt a clear field
for the chairmanship. It. is said that
P EL McCarthy is casting longing eyes
on the position and claims to have quite
a strong support, especially from the
south side of Market street districts.
Many of the McDonald supporters,
however, claim that McCarthy will not
be "in it," as it Will be shown before
long that Rainey is behind him in his
fight and is trying to sneak him in on
the- convention! and that as soon as
McCarthy has his fight fairly started
tho McDonald supporters will explode
a bombshell in his camp that will sat
isfy Mr. McCarthy that being just a
plain delegate will be his limit in the

A LOCAL INSTITUTION
Which Has Met With Remarkable
Success.
THE CONTINENTAL BTTTLDrNa AND LOAN
ASSOCIATION FAR AHEAD OF ALL
I I âºMPETITORS.
Itfi Protection of Stock io'dcrs and Sound
Financial Policy the Basis <â¢*
PubMc Confidence.
The Continental Building and Loan
Association of California has just com
â  pleted a decade of remarkable success.
Since its organization on July 17, 1889,
the advancement of the association has
surpassed the hopes of its directors and
stockholders. The recent years of finan
cial depression had no terrors for the
Continental. While other institutions
of its kind met with failure this asso
ciation, owing i" the splendid Induce
ments its system offered fnr those who
â¢ desired to build homes out of their
weekly or monthly income, has forged
steadily ahead, increasing its assets
: each year. The Continental's increase
in subscribed capital during the last
four years is particularly gratifying.
i >n June 30, 1594. its subscribed capital
amounted to $650,700. On June 30, IS9'.Â»,
'. it amounted to $5,425,500.
At the. end of June, 1898, the Conti
â  nental's assets amounted to $986,401 30.
! Its assets June 30. this year, were
(1,321,845 14. representing an increase of
34 per cent in its assets and 20 per cent
in its shares in force.
During the year 534 loans were made,
fourteen of which are already paid off.
j These were distributed In forty-nine
I cities and towns in the State. The prof
its of thn association during the last
year were $120,007 73, representing a
profit of $10.00* per month. The net
, amount turned into profit for the mem
bers during the year was $89,901 88. In
addition to this dividends of 6 per cent
per annum on ordinary deposits and 7
per cent on term deposits have been
maid. Ten per cent dividends were paid
*to holders of class "F" stock, and 13 per
(â â¢â¢ nt tn holders of class "A" stock.
The progressive record of the Conti
nental's subscribed capital during the
last five years was as follows:
1894, June 30 $ 650.700
1894, December 31 $1,229,650
1895, June 30 $1,340,200
189"., December 31 $1,740,000
1896, June 30 $2,393,100
1896, December 31 $3,986,100
1597, June 30 $5,303,400
1897, December 31 $6,340,600

1898 December 31 $7,332,700

The Continental's system governing
the withdrawal of stockholders is spe
cially devised for the protection of the
remaining stockholders. A great many
associations have allowed their stock
holders to become crippled by with
drawals. Reference to a sworn copy of
the report of the association, now on
file with the Building and Loan Com
missioners, shows that withdrawing
stockholders have left with the associa
tion $5976 33 of their profits. This report
covers every phase of the Continental's
prosperous affairs, and the directors of
the association respectfully invite the
public in general to peruse the docu
ment at their office at 331 Montgomery
street.
During its ten years of prosperity the
Continental Building and Loan Associa
tion has assisted tenants to build
homes of their own.
Much has been said against the build
ing- and loan system, but everybody
who joins the association realizes that
it is better to own his own home than
pay rent. In the majority of cases the
monthly installments paid by the. mem
bers ar" no larger than rental pre
viously paid. All over the United
States the tendency of the poorer
classes of people with an ambition to
own their own home is toward the
building and loan system. Throughout
the t'nitcd States there are fully 7,000,
--000 persons who have acquired homes
in this manner.
At no time in the history of our State
have the opportunities of securing a
home been as favorable as they are to
day. Disturbed conditions are rom
j mencing to resume their ordinary pla
cidity. The large number of soldiers on
their way to the Philippines left a large
amount of money in California,
The Continental Building and Loan
Association furnishes every one an op
portunity to own a home. Coroner Kd
E. Hill is president of the association,
and Captain Oliver Eldridge the vice
president. William Corbin is secretary
and general manager, and he will gladly
furnish all information in reference to
the methods of the association to those
who call or write for particulars to his
office at 222 Sansome street.

Close of the Championship Bicycle
Meet at Montreal.
MONTREAL, Aug. 12.â The last day nf
the world's bicycle meet was attended by
fair weather and a crowd of 15,000 persons.
Only one record was brokenâ the five-mile
amateur tandem unpaced, which Hooper
and Nelson reduced to 10:14 1-. r >. What was
expected to be the star event of the after
noon, the championship match between
the winners nf the mile amateur and mile
professional championships, turned out a

â¢ delegates in the Forty-third District
i it would be hard to find one now with
a search warrant.
On Friday evening last a meeting of
: the Democratic League of the Associ
ated Clubs was held in Buckley's Bald
win Annex. There were present some
: 108 members of the executive league. A
committee to procure permanent head
' quartprs was appointed and the ioiiow
[ ing gentlemen were elected to act as
] officers for the ensuing term: H. L,.
Rhea, president; George L. L,oryea, vice
president; Matt Brady, secretary. Ihe
I object of the organization is tor tne
I purpose of securing recognition at th"
coming Democratic convention. They
claim they have many good Democratic
votes, and point to their snowing at
last Tuesday's primary, at which they
polled over 5000 votes. They are to sup
i port the Democratic ticket, and whether
successful or not in the election this
fall intend to stay in the field and show
greater strength at next year s btate
election.
i They want it understood that it is not
' for the purpose of kicking or bolting
that they have organized, but only for
the purpose of holding together and
swelling the vote of the Democratic
i party in future elections.

His Final Request.
A Scotch farmer, celebrated in his
! neighborhood for his immense strength
i and skill in athletic exercises, very tre
! fluently had the pleasure of contending
\ with people who came, to try their
| strength agninFt him. Lord D., a great ;
i pugilistic amateur, went from London on
i purpose to fight the athietic Scot. The
I latter was working in an inelosure at a
little distance from his house when the
| noble lord arrived. His lordship tied his
horse to a tree and addressed the farmer.
"Friend. I have heard marvelous reports
of your skill and have come a long way to
see which of us two is the better wres
tler." The Scotchman, without answer-
I ing. seized the nobleman, pitched him over
the' hedge and then set about working
again. When Lord D. got up. "Well,"
said the farmer, "have you anything to
say to me?"
"No." replied his lordship, "but per
hnps you'd be good enough to throw me
my horse."â Public Opinion.
One Was Enough.
This is one of General Miles' stories.
In the Confederate army. Longstreet's
corpa was making a night march. About
4 o'clock in the morning, when every one
was worn out, a Georgia regiment
stopped. A Georgia soldier put his rifle
up against ihe tents on the other side
ot ! where Jjongstreet was.
"Well." he said, "this is pretty hard
â to fight all day and march all night.
But I suppose I can do it for love of my
country. He continued: "I can go hun
gry: [Van fight, if need be: I can die for
my country, because T love my country.
But when this war Is over I'll be blowed
if I'll ever love another country!"â W

TRIED TO BEAT
HIS BRAINS OUT
WITH A BOTTLE
Couldn't Stand Being
Called "a Bum."
THOMAS M'GRATH'S RASH ACT
ATTEMPTS TO COMMIT SUICIDE
IN A SALOON.
After Being Disarmed He Butts His
Head Against a Billiard
Table â Determined
to Die.
Because he was called a "bum" by one
of his fprmer associates Thomas Mc-
Grath, who gave his occupation as that
of a laborer, last night attempted to beat
his brains out with a bottle in a saloon ai
Francisco and Mason streets. After in
flicting an ugly wound in his forehead he
dropped the bottle and started to butt his
bead against the billiard table. Seeing
the blood gushing from the wound in his
head and realizing that he was bent on
killing himself one of the bystanders
seized htm by the throat and held him
until a police officer arrived. After being
handcutied McGrath attempted to brean
away from ins captors intending to end
nis existence in tue waters of the bay.
lie was prevented after a desperate
Btruggle and conveyed to the Receiving
Hospital, where he was treated by Dr.
Rumwell.
McGrath, some years ago, was the Beau
Brumnx-l of North Beai a. tit was pus-
B< ssed of considerable money, according
to the statement of his friends, but soon
squandered it In riotous living. Finding
himself penniless he went to tnc interior
of the State and worked as a tarm hand.
Last Friday he returned to this city ana
with the Tew dollars that he had pro
ceeded to have a good time.
Shortly after 7 o'clock last evening: he
visited a saloon at Francisco and Mason
streets and meeting several of his former
associates he asked them to join him In
a drink. As he was shabbily dressed one
of the party jokingly referred to him as
a "bum."
"1 guess you're right." lugubriously re
marked McGrath, picking up a half
emp'Ued bottle of soda water which was
on the counter. "I'll be a 'bum' no
longer."
McGrath then attempted to beal his
brains nut with the bottle when he wa;
seized by his companions and disarmed.
The surgeon at the hospital believes that
McGrath is temporarily deranged from
th^ excessive uso of alcohol. After the
wound in his forehead was dressed he
was taken to the City Prison and charged
with being drunk.

Knew Henry Irving.
Some yean ago Sir Henry Irving was
called on. in Dublin, to play a heavy part
to which he was not accustomed. One of
the actors had not turned up and there
'. was a vacancy. Irving- had to come on
early in the first act.
Now. the Dublin gallery boy is an in
stitution to himself. There is nothing like
him anywhere.
Conversations between young fellows
â  across from one side of the gallery to the
; other are spoken, in loud tones, and In
the distinct hearing of t he actors.
Irving is. as everybody knows, very
thin, and when he appeared with a stride.
which is one of the m<>st characteristic
things about him. one of these gallery
boys shouted across to another:
"Faix. an' is that him?"
"No," was th>> reply, "them is the
' young man's clothes; they'll shove him
! out later on."

DOGS NO MATCH
FOR THE HARES
AT INGLESIDE
Majority Make Good
Their Escape.
High Class Greyhounds Will Meet
and Battle for the Prizes.
Strong Hares at Union
Park.
A knowledge of coursing was not a
requisite at lngleside Park yesterday be
fore one could appreciate the sport. The
hares had the speed of the wind and led
the dogs at will up and down the fields
before they disappeared through the es
capes. This did not happen at intervals,
but marked almost without exception
every course run.
The prevailing opinion amons veteraTi
coursing nun present was that no higher
class sport of its character was ever
seen here. The longest course was be
tween Lady Enxma and One Spot, the
former winning by a score of 24 to v after
being on the field 3 minutes and 36 sec
onds. Safeguard beat Hummer by 18 to
12 after 3 minutes and 3 seconds of going.
These severe courses arc- exp< cted t<> Bpoil
any chances the winners may have had
In the subsequent rounds of the stake.
The dogs were all tested severely, few of
them running less than oW minute.
Just enough short-enders won to keep
their followers in good humor and in
pocket money. Arab defeated Rock
Island King at 1 to 4; Gypsy beat Narcis
sus 1 to 6; Terronite beat Senorita. 1 to
3- and Water Witch beat Precita Girl, 1
to 3 This was one of the best races of
the day. The Girl had speed, but in a
phenomenally long course the hare fa
vored her opponent.

of the best horses in the State are quar

UNION PARK.
Smart Hares Furnished Some
Electrifying Sportâ Night
Time a Big Surprise.
None of the hares at Vnion Park yes
terday seemed afflicted with "locomotor
ataxla" and the crowd witnessed gome
great spurt. In fact the different win
ners were returned only after long, hard
runs. The dogs, too, were in fine fettle,
reflecting much credit on their respective
trainers. On two occasions the "relief"
doge were called into requisition. Judge.
Bull's decisions were all well received and
Slipper "Jim" Wrenn was seen at his best.
Of the thirty-six preliminary courses
decided for the rich stake first choices
raptured all but live. Perhaps the worst
jarring favorite followers received was
when the crack Prince Hal, in the twenty
fourth run-off, fell before the 25-to-l
chance. Night Time. Aeneas, when he
downed Alma, after an exciting run, paid
his followers ]0 to 1, and the backers of
.Metallic laid 7 to 1 that their dog would
beal Ben Bolt, but he didn't. The fast
but unlucky Hurricane had his usual hard
tussle with Lady Clare, failing to win
out aftc-r the course had gone the limit.
Warship, the ante-posi favorite for the
stake, lai.i away Maid of Erin with con

prime factor in the betting to-day.

DUDES WIN THE
FIRST CONTEST
WITH SAN JOSE
Few Errors and Hits
Were Made.
Large Saturday Crowd Pleased With
Tame but Good Baseball Played
by Visiting Nines â Same
Teams Play To-I>ay.
Oakland 6, San Jose 3.
The Dudes have hurled destruction up- i
on the hoodoo that has been saddled like :
a nightmare upon their baseball hopes, i
Doc McGraw of San Jose knows this <
now, and hereafter he will entertain a
proper respect for the most proper ball- i
tossers of California's wild and turbulent i
city of cranks.
Eight innings were passed and not a sin- i
gle err"or was carved on the last column i
of the Oakland score. Would the mlracu- '
lous happen again? was the question i
asked by all. '
They did not have to wait long for an '
answer. Schmeer was on hand and hÂ«
fumbled a couple of hard chances just to
keep things within the pale. His jugglery J
presented the Prunepickers with a couple
of runs, but the discrepancy was too big .
to give them a chance at the game. i
In the fourth inning San Jose pushed j
Huston of Texas across the plate. One ;
of Moskiman's unbending balls caught the ;
man from the South right in the small
of the back and he went wriggling to
first A sacrifice by Graham gave Huston i
second, and a single by Borchers forced
him around the bags to the resting sta
tion. This was San Jose's great feat until :
the ninth inning, when the Prunepick
ing began to be busy. â¢ â¢
It was a gloomy sixth for San Jose ana
quite electrical for the Brummels. Two <
errorsâ one by Andrews, the other by An- j
derson â allowed Peoples and Hammond to
appropriate second and first bases respec- .
tively. Looie Hardie came to the plate
at this juncture and swatted the ball out
for 'a two-base hit, on which Pop pics
scored. L>unleavy cantered to first on
balls and the bags were filled just in time
for Lange's single to be effective in scor- :
ing Hammond and Hardie. Dunleavy and ]
l,ange were sent across the rubber by a ;
hit of Schmeer. All this time there were j
two men "dead," yet the fireworks would
not burn out. Schmeer was caught going
from second to third and the side retired,
In the eighth Dunleavy scored again.
The ninth inning gave the Prunepickers
a bit of diversion at runmaking. Borchers
took the ball in his back, went to second
on a hit by O'Dca, and Anderson came
along to till the bags after an error by
"SeWmeer. Hanlon thought Schmeer gocd
for an encore and he swatted the ball
his way, Borchers and ODea scoring on
some trifling by the Oakland shortstop.
The first of the ninth saw a beautiful
fielding catch by Donovan, who ran^to
far center and smothered a ball from
Huston's bat. The 'score:

Pitcher O'Farrell a Failure.
WATSONVILL.E, Aug. 12.â 1n keeping
with their announcement on the bill
boards, Morris' Sugar Beets gave Tut
tle's Sand Crabs a genuine defeat to-day.
The Beets piled up their runs with ease,
while the Crabs had a hard job pulling
In their only run. O'Farrell, Tuttle's latest
find has undoubtedly pitched his first and
last game In the league. His control of
the ball Is poor and his only deceptive
curve is a drop. His pitching was not en
tirely responsible for the loss of the game.
Captain Bill and Pace made costly error?
in the first inning. Levy's umpiring was
highly satisfactory. To-morrow Dauben
bis twirls for the Crabs and Dad Harper
for the Beets. The score:

I When Sigsbee Feels Like a Whale.
In an address at Fall River Captain
Sigsbee of the Texas told the following
story, illustrative of the fact that naval
men made no pretense of being orators:
"It is a very difficult situation for
me," said Captain Si^sbee, "to be re
quired to make a speech, and I am In
the situation of the old sailor who was
very fond of tea and was devoted to
the people who served it. But this old
sailor had no society manners, and had
never attended an afternoon tea. He
was afraid of the ladies, but in some
way he was forced to an afternoon tea.
He went almost in despair, and when
he got back to his ship his mates said:
" 'Brown, did you go to' the tea?'
â¢â¢ 'I did.'
" 'How did you feel there?'
"'I felt like a sperm whale doing
crochet work.' " (Laughter and ap
plause.)
Nevertheless Captain Slgrsbee makes
a very able address. â Boston Globe.
SOCIETY GOES
TO THE RACES
AT FAIR OAKS
Well-Contested Sad
dle Events.
First Meeting of the Menlo Park
Amateur Racing Association
Marked by Exciting
Finishes.
Special. Dispatch to The Call.
MENU) PARK, Aug. 12.â Menlo
Park Amateur Racing Association made
its bow before the public this afternoon,
and its initial race meeting was pro
nounced a success. The Selby track at
Fair Oaks was lined with fine equipages,
filled with the society people of Menlo
Park, Burlingame. San Mateo, Redwood
and Palo Alto, and the fleetest horses of
this district took part In the races. Early
in the day the people commenced to I
flock to the track in tally-hos, breaks, dog
carts and other vehicles, arfd by the time
the first race was called' all the available
space along the rail was occupied. A
number of parties came on breaks, among ,
them being those of Walter Hobart, Sen- â¢
ator C. N. Felton, Joseph Donohoe,
Charles Waldon, Mr. Beylard, Joseph :
Tobin Jr., Charles Joeselyn. J. D. Grant
and C. A. Baldwin.
Fully 1000 persons witnessed the races. ,
The Selby track was in good condition and :
the wind which blew down the stretch
was not strong enough to retard the rid
ers Close finishes were the order of the ;
day half of the. races being won by necks.
Walter Hobart brought a good-sized
string of horses down from Burlingame
and was rewarded by getting two nrsts
and a second himself and ; having his .
horses get two other firsts and another ;
second. He took home almost a majority
Of the silver cups that were offered as â 
prizes by the association. All the races ,
passed off smoothly, although there were |
often long waits between the contests.
The first exciting race of the day was ;
the second on the programme, a quarter- i
mile sprint, which was won by Mr. .ho- |
bart on his Qazeba by a scant neck from j
Mr. Hume on Spice.
The third race, the half-mile,- brought i
out the largest field of the day. The ]
start was a scattering one, with OMe j
Tobin on Pecksniff in the lead and Sam
Poorman on Flushington several lengths â 
behind. Flushington cut down this lead |
rapidly and at the turn into the stretch |
was on even terms. Down the stretch
they came neck and neck, Flushington !
winning by a head. Poorman is a Stan- i
ford man, and the victory greatly pleased
the university people present.
The Menlo Park Plate and. the Visitors |
Steeplechase were the events of the day. I
The plate race, the fifth, was a mile on i
the fiat, with three starters. The horses j
got off even, and at the half it was seen
that the race was between Mr. HoDart
on AH Babi and Mr. Poorman on Flush
ington, the red of Hobart showing slight
ly in advance of the green of Poorman.
In an excitinsr finish All Babi won by a
length from Flushington. Flushington j
had just won the fourth race, so his per
formance was a good one.
Mr. Page on Huntsman had an easy
thing in the steeplechase, winning by six
lengths from Nestor. A large loving cup â¢
was offered for this event.
The last race of the day was an excit- <
ing one. Miss Flitters, with Mr. Buckley
up, won by two lengths. Summary:

Uncle's Men Shut Out.
SACRAMENTO, Aug. 12.â Sacramento
succ seded In shutting out Ban Francisco
at the Oak Park diamond to-day. The
game was one of the l>est played here this
year, pienty of chances being given and
ited by both teams. The feature of
the game was Stu'.z's swift work at sec
ond and a double play by Stulz, Eagan
and O'Connor. I'mpirc O'Cnnnell did well
until the ninth inning, when he fell hard
upon O'Neil. captain of the San Francis
coa requesting him to examine an old
black ball which was being put in play.
Ho declined to do so and when O'Neil in
sisted he called Sullivan, who was at bat,

NEWPORT. R. 1., Aur. 12.â The New
York Yacht Club squadron rides at anchor
in the harbor to-nlKht and the cruise of
]K9O is at an end. During the cruise to-day
of twenty-two miles from New Bedford
the wind held on longer than yesterday,
but the yachts ran into soft spots, and
five miles from the finish the entire fleet
was becalmed for a half hour.
The Columbia kept up her record of vic
tories this wjfek, nÂ«.t only leading all the
yachts over ~ho line, but defeating the
Defender IS minute? and 4 seconds, elapsed
time. The. actual distance between the
boats was less than two miles, for the old
boat came up very slowly in the light air,
besides being somewhat delayed by a shcrt
luffing match with the schooner Colonia,
which finished about the same time. The
Columbia's victory was* nevertheless per
fectly legitimate, and she showed herseit
a marvel in tight weather.
The wind was light throughout, and at
one time failed altogether, but it treated
both boats alike, barring a short spell just
before the finish, when the Columbia
caught the breeze a few minutes before
her rival. '

SUCCESSFUL CURES
BY DR. ABORN.
On* of the most fatal diseases known to
humanity is consumption. It is always
present in our midst, silently but steadily
removing from the social circle, the cheer-
ful fireside, from private and public life,
many, very many, more annually than the
gravest or worst epidemic that ever vis-
ited our fair country. This ever-present,
ever-existlnp diseaseâ sparing' neither the
young nor the aped, and incident to all
climates and to all seasons of the yearâ l 3
CONSUMPTION.
As Nasal Catarrh, or "cold in the head,"
as well as a sirnplo angina, or "sure
throat," is not {infrequently the forerun-
ner of bronchial irritation and cough, and
as each of thesr- diseases has an invari-
able tendency, when neglected or badly
treated, to involve the delicate tissues and
structures of the lungs and terminate In
a destruction of those organs of vitality,
they should claim the prompt attention of
a skilled physician.
Of all diseases which afflict the human
family, tuberculosis, phthisis pulmonalis,
or pulmonary consumption, is the most
dangerous, as It occurs more or less In
every quarter of the globe, and occasions
a larger proportion of deaths than any
other disease.
ONE-FIFTH OF THE PEOPLE DIE
OF IT.
Statistics show that among thÂ« enlight-
ened nations of the earth the deaths from
Consumption are about one-fifth of the
whole number: and that of the people in-
habiting the globe over 3.000.000 die each
year of this disease. Any observation
further shows that no period of life Is ex-
empt, and the most talented and useful
members of every community are among
the first victims of this scourge of the
human family. This precarious state of
society arises mainly from the fact that
the patient or his friends are inclined tn
regard his affection as a CATARRH, Â«r
that th<Â» disease is only in the THROAT,
and that it will soon pass away, or that
it is only a BRONCHIAL AFFECTION.

ASKS WINE MEN TO CONVENE
BELIEVES IN CROCKER'S FA
MOUS PROPOSITION.
Producers Will Hear the Offer Gen
erally Discussed and Definite
Statements From the Capi
talist as to His Plans.
For the flrft time In the history of the ;
wine Industry the Chamber of Commerce I
iken an &j rest in its wel- '
fare by .-ailing a meeting for next Thurs
rtny t'. consider the situation, which has
now reached a critical j)eriod.
: :1 efforts of the Califor- ;
nia Wine Makers' Corporation to reor
ganize tiie grape growers and wine
in a combination for the next
and the proposition of Henry
buy al! the dry-wine grapes
at $12 and $14 per ton for the I
.. seven years, have been de- ,
/he Call recently. Mr. Crock-!
regarded by those best quali- j
the solution of the '
difficulties that have long kept the future
industry in doubt. The pri>
â¢â¢~ the producer a fair return
Investment and labor, but certain
.art its are busily engaged in
â ling grape growers from making
â¢ ; t. it is assert* d that if there
â¢ some such fixed value for grapes
;tting will be inaugurated this
and will be followed by worse con
jct year.
The Chamber of Commerce believes
Ihe Fmaller wine makers who are j
g out against the agreement are ;
. :â â¢â¢ informed regarding the in
s of Mr. Crocker, and that the
â ay to enlighten them is to call a I
rag, ?.t which the leading men in the I
business can announce themselves and â 
. xpress an opinion of the proposition, |
and at which Mr. Crocker can definitely
explain his plans. There has been fear
;:mong the smaller wine
makers that Mr. Crocker's success would
mean their ruin; that their plants for
making wine would not be employed and
that their investment would therefore be ;
unprofitable.
This is one of the points that will be I
made plain to the satisfaction of this j
It Is understood that Mr. Crocker [
will assure the producer that In each dis
trict the grapes bought will be sent to '
the nearest winery to be converted into
â wine. Furthermore, that the prices to be
paid for such service will be fair and re
munerative; also, that in the case of the
minoi or other wine maker who has a |
private trade, wine will be sold to him
by Mr. Crocker at prices that will en- \
able him to supply his trade and make a
good, reasonable, profits.
There are other features of the situa- j
tion that will be elucidated by men who
will know what they are talking about
a:.<l who have their all invested in the
business of growing grapes and making
â wine.
One of the particular points that will
be brought out Is the fact that the stock
of dry wines on hand In city and country
Is equal to one vintage, and that the
moment the Crocker contracts are as
i the value of these wines will ad
materially. This circumstance
â  nection with the fact that
this crop will be a small one. it is main
tained should be a strong factor in Indue
: r to enter into an engage
ment that is not only certain to maintain
prices, but to assure him fair re
turns fir his products.
Invitations have be.-n sent to producers
throughout the State and it Is expected
that there will be a large attendance. The
Chamber of Commerce desires it dls-
I understood that its only Interest
In the matter is to assist the different
vltlcultural elements to unite on a busi
ness basis for th* 1 material benelit of one
of the State's greatest industries.
How Animals Bear Pain.
One of the most pathetic things is the
manner in which the animal kingdom en
dures suffering. Take horses, for instance,
In battle. After the first shock of a wound
they make no sound. Th*>y bear the pain
â with a mute, wondering and if
nt night you hear a wll3 groan from the
battlefield it comes from their loneliness,
their loss of that human companionship
which seems absolutely indispensable to
the comfort of the domesticated animals.
The dog will carry a broken leg for days
wistfully but uncomplainingly.
The cat, stricken with stick or stone, or
caught in some trap from which it gnaws
its way t'> freedom, crawla to some secret
place and bears in silence pain which we
could not endure
Sheep and cattle often meet the thrust
of the butcher's knife without a sound,
fmd even common poultry endure intense
without complaint.
The dove shot unto death flies to some
far "ff bough, and as it dies the silence is
unbroken save for the patter on the leaves
of its <>wn life blood. The wounded deer
t<i some thick brake, and in pitiful
submission waits for death.
The eagle shot in midair, fights to the
the fatal summons. There is
no moan or sound of pain, and the defiant
look never fades from its eyes until the
lids close over them never to uncover
agaln.-Tit-Blts. I

result of Mudgett being too friendly
with the soldier's wife. Mudgett's wound
is not serious, although the kniff which
the jealous soldier used narrowly missed
cutting the carotid artery.
ACcGuirk was married to the woman
whom he calls his wife about fourteen
years ago in Cincinnati. He first joined
the volunteer service and did meritorious
work in the Spanish war. After h-- was
mustered out he joined the regular army.
and a short time afterward was promoted
to corporal in the signal corps, ilis wife,
at his request, decided to make this city
her home.
While he was fighting for the flag of his
country McGuirk received information
that his wife had not been true to him
during his Absence. After the cessation
of hostilities the injured husband went to
Indianapolis, his former home, and sent a
dispatch to his wife, which purported to
come from her mother. He signed the lat
ter*s name to the ulegram and asked her
to be at the depot on the arrival of the
Eastern overland, which was supposed to
â¢ â¢airy her aged parent. The ruse worked
to perfection, but instead of meeting her
fond mother Mrs. McGuirk was met by
her husband. He accused her of being un
faithful, but this she emphatically denied.
Thinking he might be misinformed, Mc-
Guirk installed his better half in a house
at 137** Tehama street. His duties re
quirt d him to be at Angel Island, but still
suspicious he determined to keep a strict
watch on his wife. Yesterday afternoon
he returned to this city, and reaching the
house on Tehama street he saw Mudgett,
the drug- clerk, walking up stairs. He
asked him what he wanted, and was told
that it was none of his business.
After brooding over Mudgett's "cheek,"
as he expressed It, McGuirk last night vis
ited the place where he is employed, and
after accusing him of usurping his wife's
aff ei tions took out a pocketknife and
slashed him across the neck, inflicting a
deep wound.
Mudgett was immediately taken to his
home, at 774 Mission street, while the en
raged soldier was arrested by Policemen
Fraher and Jordan and charged at the
City Prison with an assault to commit
murder.
PECULIAR WAY
In Which a Chicago Crook Makes an
Easy Living.
Richard TV. Smith, a Boston traveling
man, who was at the Hotel Imperial, told
this story of a Chicago crook, who Is ac
quiring a livelihood In a rather peculiar
way: "I was chatting with a frien/1 in
the lobby of a fashionable hotel in Chi
cago," paid Mr. Smith, "when I noticed
an old man coming out of the writing
room. He was shabbily dressed, but
clean, and appeared to be perfectly re
spectable. His kindly face wore a look
of annoyance as he gazed at four letters
which he held In his hand. As he ap
proached me I saw that they were sealed
and addressed, but had no stamps on
them. Finally the old fellow stopped In
front of my chair. Holding out the let
ters in one hand and a penny in the
other, he said:
" 'I beg your pardon, but have you four
stamps that you can spare? When I came
away from home I thought I had a dime,
but I find that it was a penny, and I am
very anxious to get these letters off In
the first mail.'
"It happened that I had Just bought 50
cents' worth of stamp?, and, without a
moment's hesitation, I handed four of
them to the old man. He thanked me
graciously and walked away. I turned to
renew the conversation wfth my friend,
and found him shaking wiTh laughter.
" 'You are the easiest thing: I have seen
in a long while,' he said. 'That is proba
bly the mo?t noted and most successful
beggar in Chicago. He is well known at
all of the larger hotels, and. It is said,
makes from {3 to $fi a day by means of
his little game.' "âNew York Tribune.

"NO NEED TO
ELOPE" SAID
HIS MOTHER
O. Heydenfeldt Weds
Miss Lynch.
ROMANCE ENDS PROSAICALLY
GROOM'S MOTHER PROCURED
THE LICENSE.
Oakland Miss the Heroine of the
Sudden Marriage for Which
No Invitations Wero
Issued.
Oxen O. Heydenfeldt, youngest son of
the late Judge Solomon Heydenfeldt, was
married on Friday evening to Miss Mar
garet Lynch, daughter of John Lynch,
Inspector of the Chinese Bureau at the
local Custom-house. The regulation mar
riage ceremony performed by Judge Barry
was the prosaic finish of what started out |
to be a romantic elopement. Heydenfeldt
and the fair maid of his choice had decided
that an elopement was the proper way
when two young people loved each other
and the groom unfortunately was not of
age. With this end in view the prospective
benedict went around making prepara
tions for the great event, but in some un
foreseen way Mrs. Heydenfeldt was in
formed of her eon's intentions.
It was then that all the romance of the
affair was shattered. "There is no need
to elope," said the would-be groom's
mother. "I give you my blessing. With
it goes my consent." And therewith the
lady marched down to Cupid Danforth's
and procured the license which made it
possible for Oxen O. Heydenfeldt, aged 20
years to wed Miss Margaret M. Lynch,
aged 50 years.
After the license was in the young man's
possession the services of Judge Barry
were enlisted, and together groom, mother
and Judge proceeded to the residence of
Mrs. Hamilton, 403 Devlsadero street,
where the loving hearts were made one.
The young bride's parents were not
present at the ceremony for the simple \
reason that they knew not that their
daughter was about to be married, or,
for that matter, where she was. About
two weeks ago Miss Lynch went down to
Del Mar with a party of excursionists,
intending to stay for one day at the re-,
sort. At the watering place she met
young Heydenfeldt. altered her plans and
remained a week. At the end of
the week Heydenfeldt came to town.
So did Miss Lynch, but she did not
go to the family home in Oakland. A
visit to her friend, Mrs. Hamilton, was
arranged, a fact the young lady forgot
to notify her parents of. As the days
went by pretty Margaret feared to face
what she considered the Justifiable anger
of her family, and the marriage was so
hurried an affair that there was no time
to invito parents.
Yesterday afternoon the young wife '
sent the flowers that graced her wedding I
as a peace offering and gentle hint to |
her people of what had occurred.
OAKLAND. Aug. 12.â "Why. I am most
certainly surprised," said Mr?. Lynch to
night. "I hadn't the remotest idea that
Margaret would do such a thing. But,
then, it's all done now, and all we can
do is to forgive. Ju.Â«t think, when Mrs.
rushing Wt with Margaret I jokingly re
marked 'what a fine ehaperone she made.'
She did. indeed, and will no doubt be even |
more surprised than we are to hear the
news."
The bride has just passed her nine- I
teenth summer and is a young lady of I
many attainments, and is very popular in ;
iocal society circles, where her elope- i
ment will unquestionably create a mild
sensation.
Young Mr. Heydenfeldt has just arrived
at his majority, and will shortly enter
upon the enjoyment of a considerable for
tune left him by his father.
ARAB HOUSEHOLD TROUBLES.
A Curious Picture of Oriental Man
ners.
A rurlous picture of Arnfi domestic life
has Just been exhibited before the Court
of Assizes at Constamina, Algeria, says
the New York Times. A native named
Ben Kemmari was accused of mutilating
his wife by cutting off her nose and upper
lip in a fit of jealousy. The mother of
the victim stated in court that to cure
her son-in-law of his jealousy she had
consulted a much-venerated "Marabout,
who had given her as a charm for her
daughter a serpent's head wrapped up in
hemp leave?, which was to be placed in
the folds of her husband's turban. The
woman appealed to the public present to
prove that by this method she would have
cured the man of his suspicions. There
upon several Arabs at once took off their
headgear and triumphantly showed the
same talisman, while a native officer of
the court, without being consulted, called
out to the Judge: "Yes, J have also ;i
serpent's head; it gives strength to the
man and fidelity to the woman. Had the
prisoner possessed it he would have been
Incapable of disfiguring his beautiful
wife." The prisoner when called to the
stand stated that it was just the opera
tion of concealing the serpent's head in
his turban that he objected to, and he
attempted to show that had a protruding
fang broken the skin on his head death
would certainly have followed. This was
not considered sufficient defense, however,
and he was sentenced to eight years' hard
labor.
Placed at a Disadvantage.

COMIC OPERA,
GRAND OPERA
AND ROAMNCE
g "$ VEX advertisers sometimes make
j- â 3 mistakes; they are but human,
and hence It will not be taken
jl â â /> amiss If we refuse to consider
"Falka" "the prettiest of all
comic operas." The superlative Is a dan
gerous degree â It Is the limitâ and may
be challenged for Its offenses. The truth
is, it is mediocre In libretto and little
more than that In composition, but is
made much better than it is by good
voices, careful staging and effective cos
tumes. 'Tis a pity a hero, with a Savon
arola penchant for destruction, does not
arise in our midst and include heaps of
comic opera dialogue In some of his
finest burnings. Of itself It would make
but a dull flame. A pretty stage effect of
opening windows and appearing heads
catches the attention at once and re
wards it In the first act with one pretty
duet and the solo and chorus of "I Am
My Noble Uncle's Heir." The duty of
explanationâ and such a dutyâ falls to
j r Tancred, in the person of Nace
Boneville. He adjusts his efforts he
roically to the importance of the occasion
and delivers a soliloquy, against time,
straight at the audience. This is most in
artistic, but his obedience in speaking the
ilnes at all should relieve him from all
further responsibility. He has a sorry
part to play and reaches the last curtain
unrewarded. The feature of the second
act is the chorus, whÂ»n the disguise of
Falka and Arthur is discovered. The
melody is pretty and the moving figures
rhythmical and graceful. "What a fasci
nating little Falka Miss Mason is and
what a beautiful contralto quality is re
vealed in her voice when she has a bolo
opportunity surh as the thirl acr supplies.
It is th<- prettiest thing in the opera, just
as Arthur Wooley, as Broth, r Pelican, is
the funniest. In fact, there is nothing
else that, against a challenge, could hold
Its claims to humor. His entrance, in the
first stage of Inebriety, Is done with artis
tic instinct and ii"t overdone. His pleas
ant dreams appeal to us. He dreams the
Baldwin block was built up. Two beauti
ful costumes are worthy special mention

an excellent Arthur) and Mr. Wolf's
"symphony in brown." Of course, there
are other colors in the latter, but in the
words of the only Whistler, in answer to
a critic who objected to his calling a can
vass so, a symphony in F is not of neces
sity f f f from clef to close. He added:
"You dâ fâ -." but this is not necessary
here. Next week "Dorothy' is the bill.
and is said to be tuneful and merry.
Â« â¢ Â»
Claude Mclnotte is the "I*ady of
Lyons." "This was nnp time a paradox."
but now it is a metaphor, and liberally
translated means he is the whole play.
If any one else, by accident, has a good
thing:* to say, he is likely at any moment
to have his right to it challenged by this
highwayman of choice speeches, who, in
the course of events, tells us he would
say more if he could, but (being winded)
he will whisper it to heaven. The play
has proven its strength by living sixty"
years. Bulwer "trapped the critics," so
he thought, by publishing it anony
mously, but in spite of prejudice they
would probably have said about what
they did had his own signature appeared,
for the plot is one of deep interest and
the language most poetic.
But the play has had its day. A gor
geous production, in which Sothern and
Virginia. Harned figured, ran scarcely a
week and was withdrawn. "This is the
heaviest blow of all," a production tn
fail; but there is little in it to interest
plain humanity nowadays, and most of
us are so very plain. There is no absem c
of noble sentiment, but it is put into the
months of people whose acts belie the
words, and the whole action is falsetto.
Beside, there are no good laughs. Bulwor
had no sense of humor. Colonel Dumas
is a piece of true metal, and rings through
the false with a far-reaching resonance.
He atones in a degree for his relations.
In the good romantic plays of to-day we
sink our identity with the players, forget
our own conditions, live the story with
them, and find it a good part of ethics to
do so, but when some old plays are doing
it we feel like taking the center of tho
stage, telling the characters of a world
they do not know, and recommending
wheeling, golfing and swimming masters
to the whole "set." One passage will
never lose Its beauty, and that is where
Claude paints "the home to which, could
Love fullfll its prayers," his hand would
lead Pauline. The speech is extravagant,
but so is the play. The fact, that Mlrs
Roberts is second in interest this wetk
proves what an excellent Claude Mr.
Whittlesey mak^s. The part was not be
neath the ambitions of Macready, who
created the role, and Mr. Whittlesey ha?
evidently given it serious study. Miss
Roberts makes n<i effort to outshine h'rn.
but contents herself with playing artisti
cally and simply a second to the hero. A
line Quoted above calls to mind an inci
dent that happened when Adelaide NeJl
pon was playing the Lady. "All is for
gotten." she says. "I am thine forever,"
and throws herself into Claude's arm?;.
By an unfortunate move Claude fell back
ward to the ground, and rose, in what
Bhould be a very serious scene, to the aw
ful fate of this speech: "This is the
heaviest blow of all!" "The Lady of
Lyons" is the least interesting bill of Miss
Roberts' season, but next week, as though
to make amends, we are promised a nov
elty in a dramatization of Ouida's "T'n
dof Two Flags." The play has not bet n
done before, and as Cigarette, Miss Kob
erts looks forward to a week of new
joys. Mr. Whittlesey will be Bertie
Cecil, the king of Bohemians, and Tuliet
Crosby, after a long rest, will reappear
in a character, the knowing- ones say,
seems to have been written around her.

A backward look at "Faust" at the
Tlvoli brings Miss Beckwith's Siebel first
to the mind's eye. Not that she is a
specially wonderful Siebel, but she stands
so cool and gray and shadowy and nat
ural and lithe of limb amid miich that is
Inharmonious. Whatever experience she
may traverse in her stage career, It is
to be hoped the priceless treasure of
sweet modesty she now possesses may not
be touched. I fancied T saw a tendency

work this week. Let us hope not. for her
freedom from the fault is so refreshing.
Her voice, too. has a soft mellowness that
comforts the ear. We have long known
how well Signora Pnsquali could sing the
numbers of the prison scene, but the
caressing lightness of treatment she gives
to the jewel song ajid the general excel
lence of all her work call for a special
word of approval. Her middle register
seems a little colorless and without car
rying quality, but her high notes are in
finitely sweet and clear. Opera Faust?
and Mephistos never look their eharac- â¢
ters. The "too, too solid flesh" of the |
singer gravitates against the artistic and
somehow they seem to have no sense of
grace and harmony in costume. The

very interesting. Though he does not look i

Musical Topics.
WHILE the theater-going public
is idolizing Saiassa and Ave
dano at the Tivoli. there seems
to be a lack of appreciation
regarding Berthald and Mer
tens In listening to a singer the auditor
' should never be influenced by high notes
delivered with vigor at the end of an
aria In order to tell exactly the merit
of a singer it is necessary to follow care
fully his phrasing, his emotional coloring
and" the accuracy of his recital, also the
ease of his delivery. Avadano s munifi
cent tenor sounds only free from time to
time especially at the conclusion of his
solos' which impresses one with the con
viction that he is working for effect.
AÂ«ide from these occasional outbursts,
bis voice- seems oppressed and appears
somewhat forced. Baron Berthald Jo?s
not possess these defects. He sings with
out restraint. His voic3 cannot claim
the volume of Avadano's, but he is cer
tainly more accurate and tasteful; in fact,
he Is the better artist of tne two.
Saiassa. both as artist and vocal scien
tist defies all adverse criticism. But
William Mertcns should not be neglected
on this account. "While he may not bo as
great an artist as Saiassa. his barytone
is more resonant and more vigorous tlinn
that of his colleague. Mme. de Pas.juali
has really created a new Marguerite. She
has solved the great problem of saving
the voice. Her delivery embodies all the
emotion reauired by the part, and her
enunciation or diction is exceedingly
clear In fact, she sings and plays a real
Marguerite, and does not consider the
vocal score superior to the libretto.
\ very prominent factor in grand opera
which is frequently lost sight of in the
enthusiasm for the singers is the orches
tra. Much enjoyment would be gained
by listening to the accompaniment from
time to time. The Tivoli orchestra under
the efficient leadership of Max Hlrs>c!i
ft-ld is doing astonishingly good work.
Every one of its members is an artist.
The unison, daintiness of execution and
careful shading speak well for the ex
perience of the executants.
From latest reports it is safe to assert
that Fritz Scheel will remain in the East,
where some lucrative position is waiting
for him. And unless the plans are totally
changed he will not return to San Fran
cisco next season. Fortunately for San
Francisco there is at present a gentleman
lure who won distinction as a musician
in Germany and came to this city with
a view to remain. The gentleman here
referred to is Hermann Genss of Berlin,

with a flattering: reputation. There is no
doubt that in case Mr. Scheel should de

should remain at the hospital, and they
warned him of the possible consequences
if he tried to use his hand.
â¢'lt's nothing." replied McGowan stout
ly. "I can't lose my job. I've got a wife
and two kids, and jobs like mine ain't
picked up every day:" And the man left
the hospital and went to work.
"He'll come back:" said the. doctors, and
all day long they waited for the unfor
tunate" man to return, knowing full well
that it was physically impossible for him
to work with such a hand. About 7
o'clock last night McGowan, with face
blanched and teeth set. staggered into the
reception room of the hospital. He could
just walk. His hand was swollen thrice,
its normal size.
"I stuck the day out! he said dogged
ly when the same physician took him in
charge, "but you were right, doctor!"
Soon after reaching the hospital and
having the hand operated on the man
became unconscious. Blood poisoning is
feared now and there are symptoms of
hydrophobia. That the physicians are in
terested in the case and will move all
their powers to save the brave fellow
goes without saying. In his delirium he
raves constantly about his job. He keeps
telling the foreman that it Is all right
and begs him not to hire some one in
his place. Altogether the case is consid
ered one of the most pathetic seen in
Bellevue in many days.â New York

AUCTION OUR SEATS

* n REPETITION of the scenes nt
* (~\ the Orpfreum last Thursday, with â 
"* * Mhe attendant financial success, is
"* confidently expected Monday aft. r
;"* noon at the Alhambra Theater, when
! * the auction of boxes and seats for tho

i"* reception fund is held.
"* Notwithstanding the brief time al
;"* lowed the committeeâ the concert be

I"* its members are confident that the
â "* Alhambra auction will be as spirited
I"* an affair as that which took pla

;"* tening to this grand musical treat will excr-ori by several thousand dollars ,

â * The auction will begin promptly at noon to-morrow at the Alhambra The- *â  i

"* will be on hand. *" ;
* The fame of the New York Arlons is mn far traveled to need relating. *â  j
"* Their choral singing is the perfection of that art, and on none other than >f
"* such an occasion could the members have been induced to put their vocal *â 
"* gifts on general public exhibition. The programme for the concert has been * .
"* only roughly outlined, but it .â  mtemplates the use at various times of *
I * three hundred voices on the stage. There will be thirty musicians in the *
"* orchestra and a round dozen numbers are <>n the programme, the visitors *
* to give two. C. M. yon Weber' 3 Fugel overture will be the first number, *
* to he followed by the first appearance In San Francisco of the Aricsis In *
"* one of their famous choruses. The Harmonic Society will sing Beschnitfs *
'r "Ossian," and the J. B. Frances Ladies' .Mandolin Club will render a so- J
lection. The intermezzo from "Cavellerla Rustlcana" will be played by tho ,
'r orchestra, and John PlaEf-mann of this city will sing "Pas Herz am Rh<!ir." J
The San Francisco Teutonla Singing Society will be heard in Marsch-
ner's "Liedesfreiheit." The programme will conclude with Tobani's "Amor- j^. :
j, lean Volunteer March." )f !
The price of seats has been fixed at $2 and $1 .tO, but the committee has j
* reason to believe that there are citizens in the city artistic and patriotic j^. j
X enough to burn with desire to pay a hundred times that price. If the auc- *.
* tion does not add $10,000 to the reception fund it will be no fault of theirs. *-
They are certain, however, that the auction will be fully as exciting- as Jf
1 4( that at the Orpheum. Do not forget, it costs nothing to attend, and saie Jf :
-â¦t begins promptly at noon to-morrow at the Alhambra. 34- :
at a meeting of the citizens' executive i
! committee held yesterday morning at the
office of Mayor Phelan. The session was
in the nature of a conference between the
â¢ committee and the following ladies, repre
! senting the Red Cross Society: Mrs. W.
B. Harrington, Mrs. Arthur Cornwall,
; Mrs. F. G. Sanborn and Mrs. John F. Mer
rill.
The ladies stated that the burden of
providing for the unfortunate soldier, who
had been parted from his money, and get
ting him out of the city, so that he would
not become a care upon the public, fell
largely upon them. Mrs. Sanborn said that
their work had been hampered in a great
measure by the greed of the Southern Pa
cific Company. By its efforts the Trans
â  continental Association had increased the
! soldier rate from San Francisco to Mis
souri River points from $2o to $37 00, ana
even at the latter rate refused them
I choice of route, while the Eastern roads
I have made a universal rate to soldiers or
I one cent per mile.
The Red Cross ladies ask the co-oper-
I ation of the committee in inducing the >
! railroad company to restore the former
1 soldier rate of $25. To prevent the trans
portation companies from being Imposed
upon it was suggested that it be fixed as
a Red Cross rate, and made available only i
1 upon the presentation of certificates is
sued by the society. -.â  â .
"As I understand this matter, said the
Mayor "the railroad stands in the posi
tion of trying to grab what little the sol
i dier earns, and at the same time blocking
the very work for which this committee
was organized. I suggest that we make a
united demand on the railroad association
to grant some concessions in this matter."
Vice President Crocker and Manager
Kruttschnitt of the Southern Pacific Com
pany had been invited to confer with the
committee, but they were both out of
town Robert A. Donaldson, assistant j
general passenger agent, appeared before
I the committee by request. The Mayor ex
plained to him the matter under discus
< sion. , , ,
"This is not a matter of which our com
-1 pany has control," said Donaldson. "We
cannot act for the Transcontinental As
; sociation. I am not even prepared to say
that we would consent to the reduction
asked for if all the other companies con
sented. The Government makes the men
an allowance of travel pay, which is ;
nearly double what ihe ranroad charges.
. so they ought to be able to take care of j
themselves. Although corporations are
credited with having no souls the South
ern Pacific has done much in. the interest
of charity as these ladies will testify, and
; 1 think It would have been showing the
proper courtesy to us for past. favors if
they had come to us first with their griev
ances instead of adopting the method
they have followed. This Is our first'in
timation that they desired .any conces
sions." â¢ , '
Donaldson Insisted that he would take
no notice of the matter unless the com
mittee and the Red Cross made their re
quests In writing. It was decided to adopt |
the latter course.
The matter of appropriation for decora- â 
- tions for the reception to the returning
California volunteers was considered and
It was decided that the decoration com
i mittee be allowed to expend a sum not to j
i exceed $8000. Chairman Martin of that
i committee expressed the opinion that the i
I desired effects could be produced for that :
sum.
John Ginty was â  appointed to take j
' charge of the soldiers' bank, which is to ,
Ibe established at the tent in. Union j
Square. It was decided that the books or )
certificates to De Issued would be made \
i non-transferable.

fornia Volunteer reception fund. One
hundred and lifty-flve dollars was pre
sented to the Citizens' Executive Com
mittee yesterday by lieutenant Colonel
Barnett and Major" Knapp, representing
the regimental officers. In making the
presentation Major Knapp said:
"Our regiment fully appreciates the
kindness shown us and the respect shown
our beloved friend the late Colonel Haw'
kins It was a manifestation of a spirit
for which the California people are de
servedly noted. As a feeble token of the
esteem which the officers of our regiment
bear the citizens of San Francisco, we
offer this small contribution to the fund
they are raising for a reception to their
own soldier boys upon their return to
their homes and their friends."
Mayor l'helan acknowledged the con
tribution, saying that it came as a sur
prise but that the committee fully ap
ated the spirit which prompted the
action on the part of the Pennsylvania
officers.

CAPTAIN ALFRED J. KELLEHER.
APTAIN AI..FRED J. KELLEHER was appointed yesterday chief

by reason of outside demands on his time.
The new chief of staff was adjutant of the First Regiment of In

fornia Volunteers to the Philippines.
Captain Kelleher entered the service of the State as a member of Com

his c-apabjlitlcs attracted attention, and he rose until the reorganization of
the guard, when he was commissioned captain and detailed as adjutant of
the regiment. Tpon the reorganization of the First of the National Guard
Into the First California Volunteers he was instrumental in preparing the
regiment for the field. He made a good record while on the Island of Luaon
and would now be returning with his command had he not be^n forced to
return home on account of sickness contracted in service. He has fully
recovered and will do all in his power to make the welcome of his former
comrades a glorious success.
His appointment as chief of staff is one recognition of his services in

The Young Men's Institute has decided
to accept the Invitation to take part in
the parade. The members are very en

of the order. The San Francisco Schuet- â ,

Mr. Schilling was authorized to com
municate with the Mayors of the cities
named and immediately after the meet
ing adjourned he sent each a copy of the
following telegram:
SAN FRANCISCO, Auk. 12. 1899.
California's ovation to her returning soldiers
is to, be without a parallel; enthusiastic co-op
eration from all i arts of the State. Kindly
wire- up at the earliest possible moment whether
we may look to your city to contribute- a lib
eral shipment of Christmas trees, large date
anil fan palm leaves and as many Dracaenas
cut above the ground as the patriotic generosity
of your people will sacrifice. Freight free for
the occasion. . â 
By courtesy of the. Postal Telegraph
Company the telegrams ; were sent free
of charge. The last sentence, "Freight
free for the occasion." was added after
consultation with A. D. Shepard. general
freight agent of the Southern Pacific, who
said his company would deliver three car
loads free whenever the committee was
ready, starting one from Truckee. an
other from Upton and a third from River
side. He said he would also ; instruct
agents to use their best efforts to aid in
the collection of donations. All such
freight more than three carloads, he stat
ed, would be hauled at half the usual
rate. The committee is satisfied, al
though it has not heard from Messrs. J.
B. Stetson and A. B. Foster, that their
roads will do as much as the Southern
Pacific.
It was decided that $1200 should be the
limit of the outlay in this work.
The first reply to the committee's appeal
came last night from Santa Cruz. Mayor
Lamb stated that that city would supply
500 trees and that a large delegation of
his fellow-citizens would be in San Fran-
Cisco on the great day.

DEEP MYSTERY
SHROUDS THE
MARTIN AFFAIR
Police Investigating
the Case.
SEQUEL TO BITTER LAWSUITS
CHIEF LESS HAS NO DESCRIP
TION OF THE THUGS.
$he Millionaire Reluctant to Give an
Opinion r.s to Whether the At
tacl; Was Inspired by
Enemies.
The tv.-o hired thugs who made the bru
ta! attack upon W. H. Martin, millionaire
mine owr.fr and club man, as he was
passing up Post street on his way to the
Pacific Union Club on Thursday after
nocr.i are still at large. There is little
doubt in the minds of those interested
In the cesc that Martin's vicious assail
cr.:\? were employed by somebody with
whom he had quarreled over big mining
uenls. At any rate. Chief Lees is deter
mined to sift the affair to the bottom and
if Martin's assailants are apprehended
they ana their employer will be severely
dealt with by the police.
At first th<- mine owner was inclined to
liush up the air, but now that it has
been made public he has greed to assist
Chief L.rt>:= in detecting and prosecuting
his .issiw.nr.ts. The police made several
attemuts yesterday to interview Mr. Mar
tin but he could not be found. Inquiry at
the Pacific Union Club developed the re
piv that the gentleman had not been there
during the cay. At a late hour last night
ChiefiLtes succeeded iv getting an inter
view v.lth the millionaire in his apart
ments at the ralace. V ' â 
Martin repeated the story of the attack
in? derail substantial^ the same as the
account published in The Call yesterday.
H sated that he was walking up Post
street toward the Pacific Union Club.
When h< arrived at a point near "Billy"
I vons' saloon above Grant avenue he was
â¢accosted by two rough looking men. One
<â¢ t'r-Tn struck him from behind and
lir.ocked him against the building. Both
thugs then ined blows upon his face
until he fell to the ground.
The millionaire's recollection of the af
fair *s very confused; as the first Dlow
he recei\ed; stunned him. He remembers,
however; that â  here were two ladies and
a =. -ink man passing at the time whom he
believes Â«'o:iii! assist him in identifying
hisl assailant;- and furnishing the police
with a good description of them, Mr.
Martin would like these parties to call or
their names and addresses to him at
the Palace Hotel.
The motive behind the mysterious as-
ESiult was a topic of general speculation
in club liiclc-s all day yesterday. On this
Jcnase of tne case Mr. Martin is reluctant
to' talk. He will not say positively that
ho believes the attack was inspired by a:;
ticmy. "hut his friends insist that it was.
1-urther tr.an that they say that Mr.
Martin has a well founded suspicion as to
the identity ..cÂ£- the. .enemy who inspired
The last few months Martin has
beconiefinvOlved in several lawsuits over
his Sihins affairs. The Litigation bred a
WttÂ«?reeiinK [ween the millionaire and
several other prominent mining men -tnd
It 1^ known that one of them has threat
ened Martin within the last few weeks.
W \ Nevllls the mine* owner and cap
italist, "'who is associated with Martin in
the ownership of the famous Rawhide
mine, but who is on bad terms with him
personally' indignantly denies that he had
jmvthins to do with the assault.
\ rÂ»f If.-.- has detailed Detective Cody
on the' case and to-day he will be rein
forced by other per office men. rhey
hone .to land Martin's assailants behind

LANDIS' FATHER
BALKS OFFICIALS
Lincoln Mystery Grows
Deeper.
INVESTIGATION IS CHECKED
YOUNG MANS LETTERS KEPT
FROM SHERIFF.
Perusal of Them Would, It Is
Thought, Supply a Clew in Sup
port of the Theory of
Suicide.
S;-Â«.'ip.! Dispatch to The Call.
LINCOLN. Aug. 12.â Another sensa
tional feature of the Landis murder-or
suicide case occurred to-day when John
Landis, the father, accompanied by a
lawyer, put a stop to the examination
Of th; j letters of young Landis in the
office of the latter'a store. This exam
ination was bring carried on by Sheriff
Ke.-na and his deputies. The officers
still cling to the suicide theory, and it
â  vident that they were searching
the effects of the young man for some
thing which would more clearly estab
lish their theory. It is not probable the
Sheriff will strongly oppose the attitude
of the father, who is an aged man and
an honored citizen of Sacramento. The
warmest attachment existed between
father and son, and letters passed be
tween them every day; in fact, the let
ter which young Landia gave to Night
Watchman Redding to mail a half-hour
before his mysterious death was ad
dressed to his father at Sacramento,
and its contents suggested arrange
ments for a trip together to San Fran
cisco later in the week.
The people of Lincoln, who sympathize
with the elder Landis and County Clerk
Landis in their grief, and who. like
them, cling to the murder theory, are
unwilling to believe that the former
had any desire to balk the officials' in
vestigation or to do else than guard
the purely personal matters of his son
from public curiosity. However, his
act this afternoon, whatever the mo
tive has had the effect of delaying the
investigation along the lines of self
murder. What step the Sheriff will
take in the matter of continuing the
examination of Landis' papers remains
to be seen.
The popular esteem in which young
Landis was held could have found no
more touching manifestation than in
the appearance of six young women,

averaging the age of 20, dressed all in

ers at the funeral. Only one .figure ap
peared black and woeful in the spectral
groupâ that of Miss Altha Stenger. the
young woman to whom, it now appears,
young Landis was engaged to be mar
ried. It was inevitable that some would
have thought that a love affair figured
in the mysterious death of Landis, but
such an inference appears to be wholly
unwarranted.
Forgotten circumstances arc remem
bered now, since the serious exploita
tion of the suicide theory has be
gun. It is recalled that before 9 o'clock
of the night Landis met his death some
women customers at the store re
marked that the young grocer appeared
flushed and excited, and it is said he
pleaded with r^ne of them that she
would defer her business with him until
another time.
To-night the mystery of young Lan
dis' death is deeper, if possible, than on
thf Wednesday morning when his body
was found lying on th<' floor ol his
store, his right hand covering a ragged
wound next to his heart It appears,
by th<- way. that young Landis did not
drink liquor in Matzeh's saloon, as was
erroneously stated in the newspapers
and by individuals. As a matter of
fad the three glasses of liquor which
he is declared to have taken on the
night of his death were obtained at
another place.

claims on El Dorado Creek. They are
credited, with $80,000 between them.

The outing was for the benefit of the

destroyed during; the fire which burned,
the Odd Fellows' building. Ten cars well
filled with passengers left this city, and
passengers boarded the train at Capitola
and other way stations. Through the

THE MARRIAGE

Mrs. Craven Is Still
After Fair's Wealth.
FILES VARIOUS PLEADINGS
THE DISTRIBUTION ORDERS ARE
CONTESTED.
Through the Defeat of the Trust
Clause an Opening Has Been
Left for Further Liti
gation.
Judge Slack's decision declaring the j
trust clause of the will of the late James ;
G. Fair invalid has left an opening for
Mrs. Nettle it. Craven to play her biggest;
card in the game for the dead capitalist's
millions. Mrs. Craven has marshaled her i
forces around her, and yesterday, through ,
her attorneys, W. W. Foote, Pence & ;
Penrf, Denson, Oatman & Denson and A. j
Ruef. filed a number of pleadings with the j
County Clerk, their purpose being to es- I
tablish, if possible, her claim that she is j
the widow of the late Senator Fair and |
entitled to one-third of his entire estate, i
The executors of the will, the heirs and
all persons interested in James G. Fair's |
estate are named as defendants. The de- ;
cislon rendered by Judge Slack declaring ,
the trust clause invalid has made this I
possible. When the trust Clause fell the I
estate stood as though Senator Fair had j
died intestate, so far as the larger por
tion of the property was concerned. Im
mediately the heirs at law made applica
tion for partial distribution of the real
property. The application was granted,
and then the heirs sought distribution of j
the personal property. Upon these distri- j
button orders the battle will be made.
Mrs. Craven comes into court this time
under section 1664 of the Code of Civil
Procedure, which provides for the proof
of heirshlp and right of distribution there
under. Florence Blythe Hinckley made
her fight for the millions of the hue
Thomas Blythe and she won. What Mrs.
Craven's success will be remains to be
The complaint filed by Mrs. Craven in
the matter of ascertaining and declaring
the rights of the heirs and all persons
to the estate of the late Senator Fair, and
all interests therein, and to whom dis
tribution thereof should be made, sets
forth these allegations:
First, that she is the widow of the de
ceased, who left an estate of great value,

the income from which is at present $200,-
UOO a year. The entire >st :< tÂ»- properties
itTo nexi described, and then Mrs. Craven
:ays thai none of the described properties
were disposed of by James <J. Fair by will,
this alligation being based on the defeat
of the trust clause.
No legal distribution has been made,
she says: the estate is still in process
of administration md no proceedings
havn been taken as required by section
n.i',4 of the Code of Civil Procedure for
the purpose of determining- the beirship
ami title to the estate. Hence she makes
the claim that as the widow of the de
ceased she is entitled to an undivided
one-third of all the real property of the
estate and to one-third of the profits, as
well as the same fraction of the p-rsonal
property, after the payment of the lega
cies, debts and expenses of administra
tion have been deducted, and she prays
judgment accordingly.
In an accompanying petition Mrs.
('raven prays that an â â rder lie made, as
provided by section iÂ«O4. requiring all per
sons Interested in the estate to set forth
the nature of their claims on or before
a day to lie specified by the court, not
iess than sixty days nor more than four
months' from 'the date of the order, and
that the court ascertain and d<'?lare the
rights of all persons to the estate, their
interests therein and to whom distribu
tion should be made.
The petition cf Charles 1,. Fair. Theresa
A. Oelrichs ami Virginia Fair for partial
distribution of the personal property of
the .state, filed April 23, 1897. is objected
to and resisted by Mrs. Craven. In her
pleadings In answer to the petition Mrs.
â  raven denies the allegations therein that
the petitioners are the only heirs of the
deceased capitalist and alleges "that in
truth and in fact she. the said Nettie R.
Craven Fair, i the surviving widow and
one of the heirs at law of the deceased."
She denies that they are entitled to all
of the property and that she. as such
widow, is entitled to one-third as set forth
above. Mrs. Craven further contends that
the court has no jurisdiction, authority or
warrant of law to adjudge or decree the
distribution of the personal property and
hence she prays that the proceedings for
distribution In-tituted by Charles L. Fair.
Theresa A. Oelrichs and Virginia Fair
be finally dismissed.
Another petition in which Mrs. Craven
demands that iDe findings of fact, con
clusions of law and decree of partial dis
tribution Of real estate to Charles L. Fair,
Theresa A. Oelrichs and Virginia Fair,
made and rendered April 13. 1597, be va
cated and set aside, was filed. As befora
she sets forth that as decedent's widow
she is entitled to one-third thereof and
that the. proceedings were without legal
warrant and r violation of the statutes.

to California.
LOS ANGELES. Aug. 12.â The Chamber
of Commerce here has received . a com
munication from 'John A. Kasson, one of
the commissioners appointed to arrange
a reciprocity treaty with Jamaica. Re
garding the treaty he says:
"The treaty, although signed by the
President of the United States, does not
become operative until -atifled by the
Senate. There is no public knowledge or
its provisions now, hence no intelligent
foundation for the assertion that ! the
treaty is antagonistic to the interests of
California. Personally 1 do not consider
it so." . â¢

BOARDMAN, SHE
SAYS, BEGGED
FOR HER HAND
Mrs. Gladstone Makes
Her Deposition.
WANTS HALF A MILLION
SHE SAYS THE MILLIONAIRE
CRUELLY FORSOOK HER.
Claims It Was the Defendant's De
ceased Wife That First Proposed
a Union Between Them on
Her Death.
Mrs. Elizabeth Gladstone made her dep
osition yesterday in th<? offices of Attor
ny Eugene Deuprey to be used in her ac
tion against Millionaire Joseph Boardman
of Oakland for breach of promise. For
her -vounded feelings, loss of <"tnpnnion
ship, love and affection and humiliation
Mrs. Gladstone seeks the modest sum of
$500,000.
The attorneys first questioned the plain
tiff on the number of times sin- met
Boardman after the death of his wife.
I She answered that they met flve or six
times, the meetings usually being for the
purpose of talking over business matters,
but finally Mr. Boardman talked of other
matters, including love. Hence the suit.
Mr. Bcardman was the next witness and
he added about the same amount of infor
mation to the store already in the pos
session of the lawyers and an adjourn
ment was taken till Monday.
Mrs. Gladstone, who is the mother of
thirteen living children, four now rest
ing: in the grave beside the bodies of her
two husbands, is determined that Board
/nan must pay dearly for his actions In
wooing" and winning: her and then, just
as she was the happiest in the thought of
the ?ife in store for her with ;t husband
worth 16,000,000, forsaking her and taking
as his wife a Miss Walker, who 'Maims
youth, beauty and accomplishments.
Mrs. Gladstone says that time and again
Mr. Boardman begged h< r to become his
wife, the tirst time being but three weeks
after his wife's death. She finally con
sented, stating, however, that he must
wait six mmiths. The tiny had about
elapsed. She was busy preparing her
trousseau when the knowledge <if hi? un
faithfulness came to her. She further
recites a pathetic deathbed scene and her
parting with Mrs. Boardman. Mrs. Board
man. she says, implored her to be good to
her husband and .said that she would be
happy to see Mrs. Gladstone installed In
her stead in the Boardman home as its
mistress, and with that wish in mind
banded her the keys to the house. Board
man saw this and when the funeral was
over and he had regained bis composure
he hurried to Mrs. Gladstone with his
offer of marriage.
Mrs. Gladstone says that she has known
Boardman for twenty years; long:
ago, she continues, she leased the house
in which she now lives from Boardman
for a nominal rent, the agreement UMng
that she was finally to receive a deed.
Now she says Boardman has taken step*
to nullify the agreement, his objeel be
ing to even up the suit she filed against
him for breach of promise.

GET STRENGTH AND HEALTH
FROM FOOD.
One of the surest ways to head off
| and stop disease is to make a complete
! change in diet.
Food makes the body, and if your
' body is ill cr becoming, so the symp-
toms are sort of signal flags hung up
by nature which plainly say: "Give
j me better building materials." ;
Heed the call and change your diet.
With good health a man or woman
j can do things in this world. It may
i be worth a fortune to you to learn of
'â¢â  the kind of food that rebuilds' brains
; and, in a way, reorganizes the whole
bodily structure.
Make breakfast of a dish of Grape-
Nuts and cream, a slice of entire wheat
] bread and a small bit of butter, some
j fruit and a cup of Postum Cereal Coffee
I (well made). For a hot morning the
Postum can be served cold with lemon
j juice.
This plain, simple breakfast contains
â  the most powerful rebuilding elements
: and goes to the system in such a way
as to be readily assimilated without
needless effort.
In ten days' time the person will ex-
perience such a change for the better
that he becomes a convert for life to
i the plan of warding off disease by the
i skillful selection of food.12
SPORTS, and only sports, occupy the
attention of the select set these
days. It's either polo or goif or
tennis or pony racing, and not to
he interested in nne or the other of these
sports is to he helplessly out of it.

Approval of Bonds by Supervisors.
City Attorney Lane yesterday filed an
opinion with the Board of Supervisors; re
ferring to its rights and duties in approv
ing bonds, and also the powers of the
Mayor in the premises. The particular 1
case on which the information 'was ask'-'l
was that of a bond furnished by the Peo
ple's Mutual Telephone Company after
the same had been approved by the
Mayor. The attorney holds that where\ < r
a bond has become insufficient, on the re
porr of the expert it is the duty of the*
board to require a new one.
MARRIED TEACHERS.
Under the Rules Mrs. Beanston Will.
Lose Her Place.
Mrs. A. L. Mann, principal of the Haw*
thorne Primary School, yesterday in
formed Superintendent Webster that Mi.=s
C. Hesselmeyer. who. it was alleged, had
been sent to take Mrs. George Beanston's
place, who was recently married, had not
yet put in an appearance and furthermora
that Mrs. Beanston had received no notifi
cation to vacate her position. It is prob-.
able that Mrs. Beanston will receive the
notice to-morrow morning, and it is un
derstood that she will contest the righfr
of the board to remove her.
The rule relating to marriages was pro
mulg ited some years ago and was sus
pended by the last board. The rule does
not affect marriages which took place
during the suspension of the rule, but
only these after its re-enactment by the
present board.
The rule, which is very brief and plain,
is as follows:
"Whenever a female teacher marries
her position in the department becomea
vacant."
Some doubt exists as to whether any;
notification is necessary.
To show the effectiveness of the teach
fng in the local public schools a test was
made of the standard in San Francisco
compared with one of the schools in an
interior county and this city came out
far ahead. Two pupils from this county
with high percentages and diplomas and
letters from the Superintendent presented
themselves for admission to the High
School and In the examinations received
4S and 52 per cent, while many of our lo
cal pupils received 90 to 94 per cent. Su
perintendent Webster points to this as
indicating a splendid body of teachers.
Registrar Completes Canvass.
Registrar Steppacher completed tha
canvass of the primary election returns
yesterday. Monday the official results will
be announced and the delegates elected
will receive their credentials In the after
noon. The only change is in the Thirty
eishth District, where the canvass dis
closes the election of Daniel C. Deas/
over John A. Donnelly by four votes.

PREACHED BYDR.VOORSANGER
THE ARK OF THE COVENANT IN
THE HOLLOW SQUAJIE.
A Picture Showing That tha Jewish
Army Is Capable cf Match
less Deeds of
Glory.
The Temple Kmanu-K! on Sutter street
was crowdÂ«Mi yesterday by the congrega
tion and others anxious to listen to the
anniversary sermon of the pastor. Rev.
Jacob Voorsan>;er.
His text wan from Exodus xiv:l6:
"Speak unto the children of Israel that
they go forward." In the course of
the eloquent mormon, delivered with a
pood deal of feeling, the reverend gentle
man said:
Israel is the liord's army â so we are
toid and so we often preach â practice,
of course, being a different proposi
tion. The army of God answers to the
suggestions here introduced. The sa
cred tradition hath a fine account of
the organization of the army of occu
pation. Six hundred thousand armed
men inarched into the wilderness of
Sin to be marshaled for the conquest
of Palestine and the great moral re
sponsibilities that opened upto the
descendants of the patriarchs from the
midnight hour of thoir liberation.
Imagination and poetic fervor have
often drawn a fine picture of the
march of the Grand Armyâ a picture
to gloat over, a picture to boast of, a
picture to exhibit to sturdy youth and
teach the men of to-morrow that a
Jewish army is capable of matchless
deeds of .glory. How even the hearts
of us modern text-critics will warm
toward the glowing picture! Six hun
dred thousand strongâ twelve tribal
armies, officered by their own generals
and princes and the liberator over
them all. Twelve armies organized
Into four great corps, forming in
progress a hollow square, in the heart
of which was th? Ark of the Covenant
and its consecrated ministers. Dash
ing cavalry to the north, clearing the
way: videttes far outstretched to dis
cover the enemy In ambush; pioneers,
sappers, engineers, removing imped
ing difflculties. ing then the glorious
vanguard, banners unfurled, sword
and spe-ar and armored plate glisten
ing in the desert sun. After the van
guard the Ark and its sacerdotal
hosts, the sacred paraphernalia of wor
ship and divine ministration. itself a
mighty array of glory. flanked east
and west by the Intrepid regiments of
two corps. Then the rearguard, an
army of three tribes, protecting the
women and the children, for Amalek
is a coward nomad, the scum of the
deÂ«ert. who will attack the sick and
the helpless if they be improperly de
fended. The organization is complete.
It is a glorious picture of old-time
fighting strength. I beg you to cease
vi.ur text criticism and your search
after historical evidence for a moment
or two Look at the traditional pic
turf and call it beautiful. Let it be
Traditional, but it is beautiful, inspir
ing its progress means the overturn
ing of the old, primitive world Its
motive the power that created It, is
in the heart of the army. "Within the
hollow square is the Ark of the Cov
enant, visible symbol of the invisible
vet ever orient motiveâ God. It is
the ensign lifted up by the priests
when the marching hour begins Look
ing backward nd forward both the
van and the rear can see the sa
cred ensign. When it starts the army
proceeds on its march; when it rests
{â¢ 1P army encamps. From the hollow
smiaro proceeds the order. Speak
unto the children of Israel that they
go forward."
SERMON BY DR. WISE.
Lnrge Congregation Listens to
the Distinguished Rabbiatthe
Taylor-Street Synagogue.
Rabbi Stephen S. Wise of New York
preached to the congregation of the iay
lor"-=treet Synagogue yesterday morning.
Following? is an extract from the able
cr Ts < aTah it was -who cave free and
fearless expression to the nameless
yearning of the Psalmist when he
mophe*ied Â»For my house shall be
called a house of prayer unto all na
tions Thus early in the history of
Israel was the highest altitude of Ales
â  the prophet; thus
â 
- religious separation Core
n by a Jewish seer. Not that
Isaiah looked for a monotonous uni
formity in the worship of God in the
Place of the multiplicity of forms ard
manners under which men seek the di
vine presence. "For my house sha
be called a house of prayer unto all
nations." The time would come, be
thought Isaiah, when the worship of
God would be broad and comprehen
sive enough to embrace men of every
creed in the bonds of peace and unity
of spirit; when the love of God would
<=o fill the earth that warring and en
rnitv between man and man would
cease to be, strife and passion be :io
rrore the world become God's univer
sal temple. To hasten the coming of
this time Israel hath been intrusted
from on high, hath lived nobly and
fought wellâ even died heroically
whenever men of unfaith or of sister
creed arose to retard the coming of
the day of the Lord.
In noetic form hath this hop* been
woven by the rabbis. They tell us
th't on the chief religious festivals
of W the year, when the worshipers
flocked unto Jerusalem from every
hamlet and field of Palestine men
vrere ofttimes crushed to death by the
insufferable throng. But when men
recited the prayer, "We bow our
heads and bend our knees before
thee" and. suiting the action to the
word, fell upon their faces the tem
ple site seemed to expand,, the walls
lo recede; there was abundant room
for all without jostling ana crowding.
A glorious truth is contained in this
rabbinic fantasy. When men bow be
fore God and fall prostrate before him
in recognition of of his divine majes
ty pnd suoerrml glory, they will nn<l
" room and/ if needs be. make a place
for ore another in their hearts; no
crowding out cf one another, no crush
ing to the wall of one's neighbors, put
a dwelling together amid that high
and holy calm which makes earth a
forecourt of heaven. This is the real
izable dream of Isaiah, tho half-^x
pressed wish of thÂ« Psalmist, that
region cease to divide men; that faith
bring: them nearer to one another; that
the walls of God's house exclude none.
. but rather include all. The dream shall
om" true; the Psalmist hath sung It
'.-i entreaty; Isaiah hath Been it as a
\is!on; we are bringing It to pass from
day to da i:
THREE MGRE SHIPS

Two Pick Trains and a Wagon Train,
Including Over Three Hundred
Mules, Shipped on

Preparaiions for a hard and aggressive
campaign n the Philippines are becoming
more and more apparent In the char
acter of tie transport business between
here and Manila. The troop ships are
all carryinr men to their full capacity,
and now the Government is negotiating
for three more stock ships to transport
mules for pick and wagon trains, and
horses for tie cavalry service. Those at
present in tho transport service as stock

five steamers have a carrying capacity of
j nearly 2000 animals, and before the end
1 of September they will all be westward
bound with full loads. The Tacoma, the
i smiling vessel used as a stock ship, will
be put in service as a feed ship.
Two pack trains left the Presidio yea
â  terday. They were put aboard the Slam.
! These comprised 12S mules, all fully
; equipped, and with each train there went
j a chief packer, a "cargodore," a farrier
I and ten packers. There were also 200
I mules for a wagon train and fifty escort !
' wagons, with harness and equipage and :
nineteen teamsters. The other teamsters j
for the train will be secured in the isl
ands. The wagons were all taken apart,
but beyond that everything was in readi
ness for the field. The wagon train was
also put aboard the Slam. In addition
there were eleven carloads of quarter- j
master's supplies sent out from the East :
or shipment. It looks like preparations !
for a campaign that will sweep the Island
of Luzon.

-RATT.R GROUND TO DUST.
Effects of the Constant Wear and
Tear on a Railroad.
As consumers of steel the railroads In
the vicinity of Pittsburg lead the world
During the past three months l.n miles ol
new sfeel rills, averaging ninety pounds
to the yard, have been put down or dis
tributed within thirty miles of the center
Â°ThCTe Ci a?e 1760 yards in a mile, which
would mean 299.200 yards for one line of
rl Is in" 70 miles, or 26.928 000 pounds cr
lav 53 836,000 pounds for both Lines of rails,
or 269 283 tona of steel rails needed in one
year for Pittsbuxs roads. 90 per cent of
which was for renewals on old lines.
There is somewhat of a mystery regard
ing where the steel worn out on a big
road goes to. It is ground down almost
to imperceptible dust by the constant
friction of the grinding wheels, and this
friction is 45 per cent greater on curves
than on straight stretches of track. Ihe
wear is also much greater nn ascending
grades on a straight track than on a de
scending grade. On curves the wear is
mostly lateral or horizontal, whl'" on
straight tracks It is perpendicular, with a
slight inclination toward the inside of the
rail next to the flanges of the wheels.
The millions of tons of steel ground
down to dust by the wheels of trains in
this country are lost. It cannot be re
gained for scrap, because it settles down
into the ballast, is brushed away by the
rush of air caused by the swiftly moving
train, and. like the star dust which rails
upon the ocean, Is lost forever.
In time, as civilization and the whet's
of civilization move on. the railroads of
the chief Pt^am railways, as well as part
of the adjoining ground, will become
thoroughly impregnated with steel and
iron duÂ«t from th* grinding up of rails
and wheels, because it must be renum
bered thnt the wheels grind the rails and
the rails grind the wheels, and this con
stant shower of iron and steel dust Is ac
cumulating along our railroads at a rapid
rate.â Pittsburg Dispatch.
Amusements on Sunday.
In discussing the question, "Is it wicked

slid- 'For those who are obliged to work

fourth commandment has nothing to do
with forbidding play on Sunday. It" only

There are seven grain-laden vessels In
the stream awaiting crews. They are the
British sips Belfast, Cypromene, Hydera
bad and Louden Hill, American ship Ken
ilworth, Italian bark Mario and British
bark Wynford. Some of these vessels
have been over a week waiting for men
while others have been only a few days
in the stream. The captains of all of them
are willing to pay "blood money," but
the boarding masters say the men are not
to be had. Several ships that have got
away this month had crews aboard every
sailor ox which cost the captain $20. As j
high as $40 "blood money" and $20 ad
vance has been offered by the ships in the
stream, but the boarding masters say the
men are not to be had for love or money.
Andrew Furuseth, secretary of the Sail
ors' Union of the Pacific, takes issue with
the boarding masters and says there are
plenty of men "on the beach" to man all
the ships ready for sea. "All the captains
have to do." said he yesterday, "is to do
away witn the 'blood money' that goes
into the pockets of the 'crimps' and add
the amount saved to the sailors' wages
and the seven ships tied up In the stream
will get away inside of a week. Wages
are now $20 a month. Let the captains
make it $25 a month and no 'blood money
and there will be no need to hunt for
men. Make the wages $30 a month and
I'll guarantee to man every one of the
seven ships inside of forty-eight hours,
It's all 'crimp' talk to say there are no
men. To be sure, sailors are not as Plen
tiful as before the cannery season opened,
but there are sailors enough lor all ordi
nary demands if the wages will be paid
to the sailor and not in > the shape ol
â¢blood money' to a 'crimp.'
"The boarding masters are under con
tract with the British ship Owners to sup
ply men at $20 a month. That was all
right until the law making it illegal to
pay a sailor more than one month a ad
vance went into effect.
"Then the boarding master was on the
horns o:' a dilemma. His contract kept
him from raising wages and a p advance
would not pay expenses. So 'blood money
came Into force again and poor Jack is
once more bought and sold like a sheep
in the shambles.
"I repeat what I said before. There are
plenty or men if the captains will add
the "blood money' to the wages. For $2o
a month and one month's advance the
Wynlord Louden Hill, Mario. Kenilworth.
Hyderabad, Belfast and Cypromene can
get crews inside of a weeK and for $30
2 month they can get them inside of for
ty-eight hours."
A lire on Union-street wharf broke up
a conference in the rooms of the Harbor
Commissioners in a hurry yesterday.
There were present Commissioners .blar
ney and Herold, .Charles Hirsch, chair
man of the committee on decorations: A.
E Pryor Â»f the Piper. Aden, Goodall
Company; Chief Wharfinger Percy Hen
derson and Secretary of the Board W.
D English. They were all discussing the
reception of the California boys when the
news that the wharf was on fire came
over the telephone wire. Messrs. Harney,
Herold and Henderson hurried to the
scene to look after the State properly.
Mr Pryor remembered that he had a
thousand sacks on the wharf and he made
haste to see how they were faring.
Messrs Hirach and English adjourned
the meeting, and the reception of the
California boys will be discussed again
The niter cargo of the British ship Aris
tomene, now lying at Union street, was
sent to the powder works in bags. These
bags when empty were sent back on the
Piper Aden, Goodall Company s steamer
Sunol and a thousand of them were
dumped on the wharf yesterday. Some
body dropped a lighted cigarette into the
heap and in a few moments the niter
bags were blazing furiously. For a time
it looked as though the wharf would go
and preparations were made to warp the
ships Aristomene and Queen Margaret In
to the stream. Luckily all the bags were
shoveled into the bay before the wharf
caught and the structure was saved.
Officers Lake and Mullander got a duck
ing on the water front last Friday night.
They were patrolling East street and met
at the corner of Folsom. They chatted
for a few minutes and both were stamp
ing to keep the blond in circulation. "This
is mighty thin plinking," said Lake. "It
is." answered Mullander. "There will bo
an accident here if the Harbor Commis
i sioners don't do pome repairing soon."
With that both policemen were moved to
tost the stability of the planking and both
jumped on the weak spot at once. Re
sultâthe planking gave away and Mul
lander and Lake dropped through into
the bay. After hanging to a pile for
about five minutes and discussing a means
of escape the two policemen had to shed
their coats and belts and swim to the
Folsom street float, about twenty yards
away. Lake and Mullander will not test
planking oh the front again in a hurry;
at least, not in company.
The schooner John G. North and the
1 British ship Cypromene had a narrow es
i cape from being in collision yesterday
afternoon. The ship was at anchor and
the schooner was coming in from Hono
ipu with a cargo of sug.-y- Off Meiers
! wharf an attempt was made to heave the
I North to, but the wind and tide took hold
j of her and carried her down toward tho
i Cypromene. By very skillful handling the
schooner just cleared' the ship, but it was
a very close shave.
Daniel Murphy, a stevedore, fell down
a chute Into the coal bunkers of the trans
j port City of Sydney yesterday â  and re-
I mained "there while a load of coal was
j dumped upon him. "When his plight was
1 discovered he was almost dead. He was
removed to the Receiving- Hospital, where
it was found that he had been badly cut
! and bruised and had suffered internal in
| Juries. ;
A FORTUNE AFLOAT
FOUND BY A WHALER
TWENTY-ONE THOUSAND DOL
LARS' WORTH OF AMBERGRIS.
Sixty-Five Pounds of the Valuable
Substance Captured in the Japan
Sea by an American
Whaler.
A small lump of dirty gray, greasy stuff
was picked up in the Pacific Ocean near
the Japan coast about six weeks ago by
the crew of the American whaling bark
Morgan. The lump weighed sixty-five
pounds, and when taken on board and ex
amined was found to be pure ambergris,
more valuable than gold, ajid worth $21,
--250 which is its value at the market
price in San Francisco, $XSO per pound.
Ambergris is supposed to be a subslance
formed by disease in the stomach or the
gall ducts of the sperm whale. It is
ejected by the animai and floats upon the
water or is cast upon the shore avid buried
in the sand.
It is used to fix valuable perfumes,
or to make them la.st. and for that reason,
as well as for its rarity and the difficulty
of encountering it, its price ordinarily
ranges from $300 to $350 per pound. Gold
at $16 per ounce i 3 worth only $256 per
pound avoirdupois.
The Morgan cleared from this city No
vember 26. 1898. and will return in the lnt
ter part of next October. At the 'irne
the ambergris was picked up she had on
board 1227 barrels of whale oil. She I? on
her way to the Okhotsk Sea for whale
bone and more oil. The officers and crew
will have a snug sum coming to them for
their lay of the rnrpn.

The visit of the grand matron to Carlta
Charter last Wednesday night was a very
pleasant affair. For the chapter there
was nothing but praise from the visiting
official and congratulations from . the |
many visitors who filled the chapter j
room. A banquet followed the visit.
There has seldom been a more agree
able evening spent in this city in any
chanter hall than the one on the occasion
hegrand matron's visit to Century
Chapter." In appreciation of the grand j
matron the membership presented her
aVbunch of the most beautiful pinks ob
tainable. Among the visitors were Asso
ciate Grand Patron Darling: Ella T. Hall,

Ivy Chapter; Mrs. Annie Johnson, matron j
of Harmony Chapter; Mrs. B. B. Duncan
matron, and E. K. Head, patron, of j

of its recent meetings initiated twelve j
candidates. It is now the banner chapter ,
of this jurisdiction, having more than 400

THE ODD FELLOWS.
One of the most energetic workers for
the order of I. O. O. F. in San Francisco
i* F L Turpin, noble grand of Pacific I
Lodge who last Sunday was elected vice i
president of the Relief Board. He is con- .
necf-d with the Columbian Bank and has j
a large circle of acquaintances. He has
succeeded in getting more members into,
the order than any other one man in the
past term. His record for that term was j
twenty-two, and thus far this term he j
has secured four.
La=t Tuesday night â  ere was an at- ,
tendance in the hall of Bay City Lodge

who is past grand of the lodger acted, that
night as noble grand, while Joseph *-â¢ !
Regensburger, the brother, who is the ju- ;
nior past grand, filled the chair of the |
vie* grand. The ceremony was conducted j
with all the impresslveness of the degree,
and it became doubly impressive when as j
the work was progressing it was realized ;
that a fatht- r was making his son a fra
ternal brother in one of the grandest or- ,
ders of the. universe. The scene that fol
lowed the ceremony was one that will j
never be forgotten by those who were
present. At the close of the meeting there i
was a banquet in an adjoining cafe, where i
there was an hour of good cheer and a j
most eloquent address by Wallace Wise, ;
brother of Rev. Stephen S. Wise, now
visiting this city, and by Robert Burns j
and many prominent lights of the order, j
Abou Ben Ad hem Lodge had a double j
initiation last Thursday night in the pres- j
ence of a large number of members of the |

The ladies of the Rebekah Drill Corps, j

proficient in the evolutions. They have j
taken to instructions with swords, but
they are somewhat deficient in the
hand! of the weapons; "But." as one j
of the corps said, "we will soon overcome
that. The only thing in connection with
Them is That they tangle up when we are
marching, and it seems that at present |
we are exercising with swords, with hands j
and feet." The first public exhibition by i
the <"orps will be on the night of the Ist I

appearing as special prosecutor. Flynn
told his story of the assault, and he was
corroborated by the woman, who gave
her name as Mrs. Ohereigionl. Then
Chereigloni took the stand and testified
that Flynn had been paying attentions to
his wife and he "could not stand it." At
torney Wilson asked him if he was mar
ried to the woman, and he said, "No, but
I am willing' to marry her now." The
Judge called up the woman and asked her
which she preferred, Cheseigionl or Flynn,
and after some hesitation she replied,
"Chereigioni."
"Will you marry him now?" asked the
Judge, and she replied that she wanted a
little time to think it over. The Judge
thought that it would be punishment
enough for Chereigioni to marry the
woman, and after Interpreter Demartini
had talked with the woman and Cherei

wanted till Tuesday to get suitable clothes

delivered a patriotic address, Baying that
: the order had been accused of being
i English and it was his hope that the
membership, while it admitted that it had
: obtained its charter from the English high
| court is in this country loyal to the flag
i that floats over the land and is as Am

KNIGHTS OF MACCABEES.
At the review of Golden West Tent last
| Tuesday night there were presented eight
i petitions for membership and four candi
â¢ dates were admitted by initiation. The
! membership of this tent now exceeds 250,
j and it is still increasing.
State Commander Hall, who returned a
I few days since from the review of the
! supreme tent, mud-* a very concise and
! interesting report of the work done at
I the session. One error about Sir Knight
| Boynton, founder of the order, and for
j many years the supreme record-keeper,
i was corrected by the speaker. It was
I the opinion that the old-time rccord
i keeper had been turned down." Such;
i however, was not the case. He retired
i from the office of his own volition, ill
j ness not permitting him to devote iiis
whole time to the duties of the office,
' but he was created advisor to the order
i at the same salary he received as record-
I keeper in recognition of his services and
I knowledge which is considered indispen
i sable.
Last Tuesday night there was a meeting
j of representatives from all the tents in
this city and those in A lamed a County
i for the "purpose of making arrangements
! to take part in the reception to the Cali
i fornia volunteers. Sir Knight Newman
i presided and Sir Knight Unger acted as
secretary- It was decided to parade with
the other organizations, to have a Â»at
and that the members shall wear a dhs
i tinctive sash. Deputy Supreme Com
j mander S. W. Hall was chosen as mar
: thai of the division and he will select his
aids. Sir Knights Freeman and Arbogast
were appointed as aids to th" grand mar
shal, L. â¢'. Pistolesi.
San Francisco Tent held a very inter
esting and largely attended review last
Friday evening, on which occasion a num
ber of the returning volunteers from the
j States of Utah, Nebraska, Oregon and
| Pennsylvania, members of the 'order.
| were present. They were given a hearty
welcome and some interesting remarks
were made by these brave fellows who
have distinguished themselves on the
! battlefields of Manila. A class of four
-1 teen candidates were initiated into the
order by the degree team of the tent.
Fifteen applications were read by the
record-keeper. This is a starter of the
good work expected of, the deputy su
preme commander, .T. W. Arbogast, whose
| services this tent has secured to enlarge
the membership.
The tent members are working together
to have, if possible, a delegation turn out
to receive the California Volunteers.

LADIES OF THE MACCABEES.
San Francisco Hive of the Ladies of the
Maccabees has of late been very -active.
Scarcely a review passes but some candi
date Is initiated and some member pre
sents an application for membership.
California Hive has been asked to be
come the auxiliary of Pacific Tent, and it
is probable that the request will be
granted.
Phebe Hearst Hive of the Ladies of the
Maccabees has received a dispensation
to change its name to Golden West Hive,
; and having done this it will now be the
i auxiliary of Golden West Tent. The
: lady commander, Mrs. Eva Bates, by rea
son of being absent from the city for a
great deal of the time, is unable to at
u-iki to u.e duties oi the oince, ana ior
I that reason, much to the regret of the
: membership, has tendered her resigna

SOLD OPIUM FOR GUM ARABIC.
F. E. Rockstroh Admits That He Is
Not a Pharmacist and Is Con
victed by Judge Tread
well.
F. E. Rockstroh, who has a drup?tor^
at Seventh and Howard streets, appeared
before Judge Treadwell yesterday on two
charges of selling opium to John Keenan
without a physician's prescription and for
not registering the fiale In his books. The
first charge was dismissed owing to an '
informality in the complaint, but the -sec
ond of not ieglstering the sale was pro- |
fled with. Rockstroh took the stand in
hi.- own behalf and explained that KÂ»er.nn
came into his store and asked for 10 cents'
worth of gum arabic. He "mistook" a
jar of crude opium for the gum arabic
and gave it to Keenan. At. least he
thought he had.
"Are you a registered pharmacist?" [
1 three degrees in a manner that may have
been equaled but never excelled, were
treated to an excellent programme, one of i
the features of which was an address by :
! Fred H. Hastings, who a few days since
' returned from the session of the senate of
the order. During his visit East he was
I taken ill. but he pulled through and is j
. in good condition again. He gave a SUC
i cinct and interesting account of what was
' done at the session and was loudly ap-
p lauded.
There were presented several choice
j selections by the National Union quar
: tet. vocal solos by Mr, Purdy and Mr.
I Kerr of the quartet and short addresses
by President Arter of the Cabinet and
! President Gentry of Berkeley Council. j
The council voted $2". to the fund of the

UNCLE MOORE'S
DEATH TOO LATE
The Estate They Say
Was Looted.
RELATIVES WERE NOT SOUGHT
FRANK SANDERSON MAKES
STARTLING DISCLOSURES.
Thousands on Deposit in Bank Van
ish and Escheat of Balance to
the State Will Be Bitterly
Contested.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
Broadway, Aug. 12.
Frar.k Sanderson has come all the way
from Clifton. 111., to discover that the
comfortable estate of his uncle, W. W.
. who died intestate at Emeryville
on February 11, ISM. has evaporated like
a Scottish mist before a July i >
sun.
The estate had been settled up
tically through ex-Public Adminisi
James Stanley, and of t â¢

petition for let- and \\ hicl

a local bank, but a remnant â $690 â re

account this sui s to the :>â¢
t alifornia to the credit i f tne school fund.
And all this not wil
were at least six ling in
the E :.tly. through a
letter from An J. G. Alattos. itarntd
â 
The mom 01 an heirless estate is un
der the law paid into tne county treasury,
iind the custodian of mis strougoox then
pays it o\tt to tiie Stuie Treasurer. Tnis
iiai airtauy been none in trie Moore es
tate, but a bitter contest was commenced
this afternoon in Judge Hall's department
of the Superior Couri for the recovery 01!
i*t least me $bi"J ciaimed by the heirs.
Frank Sanderson, tnrougn his attorney,
J. G. Mattos, had petitioned for the distri
bution of the remnant, but E. Myron
Wolf vigorously opposed the petition un
oer autnoiization 1 1 â¢â in the Attorney Gen
eral. He contended that the estate had
been fully closed up and that since no
heirs hacflaid siege to their claims within
the five years limited by the Civil Code
the money had already escheated to the
btate. He insisted that the money be
longs now to the State school fund and
that he, therefore, is moreover entitled
to his commission -for having so engi
neered the estate's remnant. Attorney
Wolf, however, stated that the Attorney
General courted an adverse ruling of the
Superior Court in order that it might
prove a test case. Wolf went to the
extent of declaring that a foreigner might
er.joy a longer term to appear as a claim
ant than heirs who silently abide in this
count
Attorney Mattos, for Sanderson, was
permitted" to submit a deposition of one
of the heirs. Sue Brigham. wherein de
ponent declared that she had only re
cently learned of Moore's death.
Judce Hall decided to continue the nat
ter for further hearing on briefs" to be
tiled within twenty days.
The most sensational feature of the case
is the story of a discovery made by San
derson, and one that will prove startling
under th*- circumstances.
"It has been claimed by the ex-Public
Administrator that no heirs could i"
found." said Frank Sanderson to a Call
reporter this evening, "yet when I rum
maged about my uncle's papers at the
Randett Hnu=e in Emeryville as soon as
i arrived I found a pile of letters Mr.
Moore had received from my mother anil
from many other relatives during th-? pnft
fifteen years. Now it Is strange that
through* these letters, most of which had
been opened, the Administrator was un
nWo to locate an heir.

that the money has been used, and lust
at the moment that the balance should
escheat to the State this attorney, Mr.
Mattos, accidentally finds a letter among
the Administrator's papers giving a clow
whereby we are all suddenly located; but
alas! too late, according to the Attorney
General's representative. There can be
no question in my mind that some of
them well knew that heirs existed, and
we now propose to assert our rights."
Attorney Mattos claims that he recent
ly found the letter mentioned giving a
clew to heirs, and that he, of his own ac
cord, apprised Judge Hall of the discov
ery and had an order issued appointing
him attorney for the heirs.
According to the list of claims filed
against the Moore estate, under the ad
ministration of Stanley, are those of Dr.
E. H. Wooisey for $105 "for medical attend

SOME HOT SHOT FOR
OAKLAND'S OLD "ROOKERY"
Councilman Mott Is Anxious to Do
Something That Will Destroy
the Old Shack.
OAKLAND Aug. 12. â Councilman Frank
Mott has a good foundation on which to
build his plfa for a new City Hall. A. M.
Dewey, a Government expert, when ho
visited Oakland to prepare a report on
municipalities, wrote the following para
graph, which will app< ar in the official
â¢ sunn to be Issued from Washing
ton:
The present City Hall is a rookery
and a firetrap in which it is positive
ly unsafe to store public records and
would not be considered a safe build
ing in the tenement house district of
an Eastern city.
With this as a text Mr. Moit has issued
the following:
The Government report will be pub
lished soon and will be scattered
broadcast throughout this country and
circulated abroad and it cannot help
giving -Oakland a black eye. Now it
seems to me that it is high time we
did something toward placing our city
in the front rank in regard to munici
pal improvements. It is high time
that We should house our library and
municipal departments in suitable and
safe structuresâ buildings that are in
keeping with the city's size, import
ance and the social standard of its
population.
The time to do it is now. We have
the opportunity. Why delay any
longer? We have put off from year to
year and year to year until most of
our townspeople are disgusted and
hold us up as a laughing stock. There
is absolutely no reason why the
scheme proposed should not be carried
out to success and at once.
Some one has said it is not the
"ideal" propos..ion. I do not say it
is. but are we to wail until we get the
Ideal? Shall we lie dead a few years
more and as a city keep on deteriorat
ing? Every ay that we maintain the
"ramshackle" we advertise ourselves
as rogressive and afflicted with a
bad case of "municipal decay," and
fo long - we permit things to go on
as at present we cannot expect people
of means, homeseÂ«kers and investors,
to come among us.
The proposition to obtain a new mu
nicipal building as submitted is a sim
ple one. Washington street should be
opened through to San Pablo avenue.
X.-i one can deny this. After opening
up Washington street the city has a
piece of land that she has no use for.
It is valuable for business property
and the proceeds from its sale will
erect and furnish a suitable, commodi
ous and handsome City Hall.
This piece of land as now maintained
is not ornamental. It is really an eye
sore and a lounging place for idlers
and maintained as a park it cannot be
anything else. In. its vicinity it act-! as
a bar to the extension of the business
area of the city. Its sale and improve
ment will add $500,000 to the assess
ment roll, the taxes upon which we are
losing by maintaining things as they
are. and its improvement, together
with a new City Hall building, will put
half a million dollars in circulation
and will start us on the upward grade
toward municipal prosperity and
greatness. FRANK K. MOTT.

"to be arrogant in the enforcement of the

of those regulations that people think will

SQUIRREL TAILS
BROUGHT THEM A
SMALL FORTUNE
Are Now Wanted for
Felony.
FIVE HUNTERS IMPLICATED
THEY BUNKOED MERCED COUN
TY SUPERVISORS.
Slaughtered Thousands of Squirrels
in Berkeley Hills and Sold Their
Tails Where They Brought
Bounty.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call;
908 Broadway, Aug. 12.
Through the cleverly directed curiosity
of Deputy Sheriff Peddler it has been dis
covered that the Board of Supervisors of
Merced County has purchased 75.000 tails
of squirrels slaughtered in the hills back,
of Berkeley and Contra Costa County,
paying therefor $1500, and for which the ,
board has no earthly use. But the au
thorities are now eagerly searching high
and low, far and wide, for the squirrel
tail vender* who thus mulcted the Merced
County treasury and for the arrest of
whom' warrants have been Issued on
charges of felony.
Merced County pays a bounty of 2 ceius
per tall and hide of the festive squirrel
that has in times past ravished and laid
waste the crops of farmers within its j
confines. Alameda and Contra costa :
counties pay no bounty, and here the
squirrel thrives unmolested so far as au
thoritative interference is concerned, but
the two premises have proved a gTeat in
ducement to a small band of market hunt
ers residing in this county, who thereby
have reaped no small fortune.
At a recent meeting of the Merced su
pervisors claims aggregating $44?, repre- ,
senting the bounty on 22.400 squirrel tails, â 
were allowed and paid to five Alameda
County hunters. â¢â .â ".
TheÂ«=e claims had been sworn to In due
form, but Deputy Sheriff Peddler has !
since discovered that the 22.400 tails had
been delivered by five market huntei*
named J. Lambert, J. Lambert Jr.. John
Doe Whytenbeek. Sears and Buckley
within twenty-four hours after they
reached Merced County. This discovery
led to immediate further Investigation,
and it has been found that the rive men in ;
question have thus far collected from !
Merced County $1500 and over.
It has since been learned that all of the
squirrels whose tails wye sold to the
Merced Supervisors were shot and skinned
in Alameda and Contra Costa counties.
Sheriff Rogers' deputies have beÂ»n
working in conjunction with the Merced
authorities, and they have succeeded in
arresting J. Lambert and his son at their ;
homes in Berkeley. These two have been
taken to the Merced County Jail, where
they are hooked for felony.
The other three hunters implicated nave
thus far evaded arrest, but it is expected
they will be rounded up in a few days.

TWO FRIENDS QUARREL
WITH LITTLE CAUSE
OAKLAND, Aug. 12.â Miss Mamie Kelly
was arrested this morning on a charge of
embezzlement. The warrant was sworn
out by Mrs. M. E. Deeds, and while the
case developed an amusing feature the
court evidently did not consider a crime
had been committed, as he released the
defendant on her own recognizance.
Six months ago the two young ladies
were the best of friends, living in San
Francisco. Mrs. Deeds was the owner of
a valuable ring, and being about to go
East for a long visit she allowed Miss
Kelly to pawn the ring to assist her funds.
When the pledge was about to expire Miss
Kelly redeemed the ring and paid the in
terest.
When Mrs. Deeds returned she at once
demanded the ring from Miss Keiiy. but
seemed to be in no hurry to reimburse
her the amount of the interest. On the
other hand, when Mrs. De^ds went away |
she borrowed n valise of Miss Kelly, and
on her return she was in no hurry to give
it bark. Between the valise and the ring
the two friends quarreled, and finally Mrs.
Deeds swore out the warrant c-arging her
late friend with embezzlement.
â¢ After hearing both sides of the story
Judge Smith said it was nonsense to take
such a case into court, and ordered Miss
Kelly released on her own recognizance.
YELLED AS HE JUMPED
FROM THE FERRY
OAKLAND. Aug. 12.â A man jumped off
the 11:15 ferryboat to-night from San
Francisco just as it was approaching the
Oakland slip. He was on the rear part ot
the lower deck and as he jumped over
the rail he shouted loudly, attracting
everybody's attention. The ferryboat was
so near the slip that tht- waves washed
the would-be suicide on to the piles. He
yelled like an Indian and the passengers
thought he must be impaled on a spike.
A boat was slowly lowered and the man
was taken from off tho piles and landed
on the steamer deck. He was not injured
by his experience. He appeared to be
somewhat under the influence of liquor.
His name could not be learned.

JTJDGE SMITH FEARS THAT HE

After a Pathetic Scene in Court Young
Mrs. Madden Goes to Friends.
Pleads Devotedly for Her
Husband.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, Aug. 12
Judge Smith had a hard task this morn-
Ing persuading young Mrs. Madden to ac
cept her liberty. The little wife, who .s
but 17 years old. cried bitterly when the
Judge told her she was perfectly free and
could walk out of court. She did not want
to go without her husband.
She told the court that liberty without
him would be infintely less pleasant
than imprisonment, but his Honor could
not be prevailed upon to be as lenient to
the young husband, who has been tried
and whose case now rests with the court.
It was in vain that Judg. .^mith told the
girl that she would be bett'-r off without
her husband. The court recalled the fact
that Madden is an opium eater, and that
when he was arrested a large piece of the
drug was found on him. He also outlined
the future which she must expect if she
persisted in remaining with her husband,
but none of the argument had any effect.
Finally Mrs. Madden consented to go to
the home of Mrs. Sarah BrilliaJit, in San
Francisco, as the lady had expressed a
willingness to receive her. Officer Kyie
accompanied the young woman across the
bay at the suggestion of the court.
"This is a peculiar case." said the Judge,
"and I have not yet made up my mind
h<>w to handle it. Madden found, as he
says, two children's rings in the elevator
of* the hotel and Kept them for several
weeks. It is very evident from his ap
pearance that he is an opium fiend, and
there is much doubt as to the extent of
his guilt. I also want to consider the
point as to whether the girl would be bet
ter off with him or without him, and as he
is safe in jail at present I shall not decide
his case for a day or two. If I could be
persuaded that his influence over the girl
woud be for good I would release him.
but at present I am inclined to think that
the girl would be better off if she ni â  i
met him again. It is not an easy matter
to decide such a question between a hus
band and wife, who are practically chil
dren. I am convinced, however, that
whether he be guilty or not his wife haa
no share in the guilt."

Just the Profile Taken.
A novel departure from the conven
tional portrait -hotograph has been
made by photographers this season.
The new photograph reprod ices only
the profile and a very artistic effect is
added by employing unusual effects in
lighting. In view of the old conven
tional methods of trimming and mount
ing photographs, these new portraits
are c-ceedingly daring. In many of
these portraits a part of the head is
completely cut away, leaving only the
line of the -"'file. This is done always
in such a way. ho- ver. that the
familiar linesâ that is, those which
serve to reproduce what is commonly
known as the "'- a nessâ are all pre
served. The negatives made by these
photographers are seldom retouched to
any extent.â New Orleans Democrat.

IF YOU
want to throw your money away each month,
keep on paying the landlord. He takes your
money monthly in advance, and in return
gives you the use of the house for that month.
One month's rent not paid out you go. With
this same rent money that you now throw
away I can give you a modern home. You do
not have to pay me in advance, and every
month you pay me you own Just that much
more of the house. You have to pay but a
very few years and your home is then all paid
for. It is yours, and no more monthly pay-
ments. All this with the same money that
would have gone to the landlord.

MOTHER'S CUSTODY.
Owing to the Nature of the Evi

Special Dispatrh to The Call.
LONDON, Aug. 12.â The Queen's Bench
division of the High Court of Justice was
the scene of a second development in the
case of Mrs. William Y. Perot, charged
with the abduction of her daughter,
Gladys, from Baltimore.
Judge Lawrence fixed 10 o'clock this
morning as the time for hearing the affi
davit which W. H. Perot, the father-in
law of Mrs. Perot, handed yesterday to
Mr. Rose-Innes. counsel for Mrs. Perot.
This document is remarkably strong both
in terms and alleged facts and from the
nature of these the case was heard in
camera, the only persons present at the
proceedings being W. H. Perot, Detec
tives Gait and Collins, Solicitor General
Richards; Mr. Rose-Innes, representing
Mrs. Perot; Newton Crane, who appeared
for W. H. Perot, and a reporter of the
Associated Press.
Mr. Rcse-Innes, addressing the court, r
said: "I only received the affidavit In this 1
case at 10 o'clock yesterday. Taking into !
account the fact that it is remarkably !
strong, tracing the career of my client j
since her marriage, and that it contains |
allegations of the worst character, I must
ask you to adjourn the case to a con
venient day that we may have an oppor
tunity of answering it. If I read to your
Lordship paragraph 7 you will see whore- ;
In li( s the strength of my application. It j
states that whereas, Letitia Perot has
been leading an immoral life since 1892,
'cohabiting successively with three per
sons, and during the past tiiree years has j
dwelt and cohabited with John Xeptune
Blood, barrister, as bis wife, and further
has been r< siding with the same in com
pany with the child, Gladys, since her re
turn to England, she is an unfit person to
take charge and control of the child.
"Now, I may point out that the whole
of that paragraph is false. There is no '
'John Neptune Blood, barrister.' >frs.
Perot has been residing with her sisters
the entire time since she came to Eng- |
land. We want to answer this affidavit
in extenso."
Newton Crane th^n urged there was no
n< cessity to argue the case now. A writ, j
he added, may issue, and In that case it
may be argued.
The Judge, in giving Judgment, said: "I I
shall order the chiid to remain in custody
of her mother until Wednesday on the
undertaking of Mr. Rose-Innos that the j
child is produced in court."
Mr. Rose- lanes gave the undertaking !
aiiri the proceedings ended.
During the hearing William H. Perot:
was an interested spectator of the right
for the possession of the child, occasion
ally prompting counsel. Neither Mrs.
Perot nor any of her friends were pres
ent.
.Air. Perot's affidavit refers to Mrs.
Perot's domicile at his house after her 1
husband went to Demerara and the re
quest of her sUter-in-law that she move,
owing to the BCandals she was creating.
It also dials with the alleged extrava- I
gance, financial difficulties and judgment ]
summons for debts. Among the points
raised, the affidavit avers, Mrs. Perot .
has been a patient of a notorious doctor
named Collins, now undergoing ten years
penal servitude for causing the death of 1
a London society lady, Mrs. L'zelli.
LIKE A WOMAN.
Blaster Says You Can't Tell Wliat
Dynamite Will Do Next.
"A cartridge of dynamite la pretty
much like a womanâ you never can tell
what it Is going to do next, because it
does not know Itself." said a boss blaster.
"1 have seen a powder salesman throw
a enrtridue of dynamite into the red-hot j
firebox of a twenty-horse boiler and the |
stuff just burtud like hud. Next day 1
saw a cart boy repeat the experiment j
with a blacksmith's forge and a pill of
dynamite no larger than a peaâ and there
will be wholesome fear and soft coal in j
that buy as long as he lives. I have seen |
a cause of lUO sticks of dynamite fall HX> :
foot, down a .shaft and never wink, and :
I've seen an Italian drop a half car
tridge from his hand to his boot and not
a grease spot did the poor fellow leave
behind.
"At that the poor fellow deserved a
better fate, for he made a desperate liprlit
fiii- it before he scattered. He was load
ing a blookhole at the time, and had
just broken a cartridge in half, when he
dropped one of the pieces. Before it
could touch the ground he sort of half
caught it. and then began a desperate
briei Juggling act. Again and again he 1
half caught the deadly thing, 'i lion he I
missed it. He made cue lant effort, and
stuck out his boot to break the fall
against the hard ground, but it didn't 1
work. There was a bang, and it was
lucky no one stood near him. Which j
shows that dynamite is like a woman,
because in my time 1 have dropped sim
ilarly hundreds of cartridges of dyna
mite, and still 1 am here and with a good
difcestion.
"But it is in winter, when dynamite
freezes, that it Is most capricious. Then
if you want it to go off it simply refuses. 1
or burns with a dull roar, like a boiler !
blowing off steam. It is In thawing dyna
mite that most of the accidents happen
about which you read. There are two
ways of thawing dynamiteâ one, by piac
ing the cartridge on a steam boiler or
â within safe distance of a tire; the other
by immersing them in pails of hot water.
As the latter method draws out consider- )
able of the nltro-glyc_rine from the car
tridges and therefore weakens them it is
often discarded In favor of the more risky
thawing by an open lire. I once saw an
experienced powder man thaw a dozen
cartridges by an open fire, though, as the !
secjuel will show, he completely lost his
head when suddenly confronted with an
unusual emergency. He had placed the
cartridges within a foot of an open wood
fire and had seated himself near by to
await developments when one of the car
tridges caught fire. Had he left It to burn
itsolf out the chances are a thousand to
one that nothing very startling would
have happened, for it is concussion and
not fire that explodes dynamite. Instead,
he rushed forward, picked up the burning
stick by one end and holding it upward 1
like a candle began to blow and blow un- j
til he was black in the face. lie never let
go until the flames began to nip at his fin
gers, and then in his excitement he threw
the cartridge to the ground and began to
stamp and grind on it with his heels, as
if he were killing a snake; and. by thun
der! he stamped out the burning cartridge i
and lived to tell about it! The cart boys j
called him 'Angel' after that, because by
rights he ought to be an angel now.
"One day a professor from Stevens In
stitute of Technology came to the quarry
and asked me to perform a certain ex
periment for him. \V> printed with dyna
mite direct from a newspaper onto a block
of iron. The professor said the experi
ment proved most interesting, as he had
discovered among other things that dyna
mite works downward and not upward,
like black powder. Our way of proving I
that in a quarry is to lay a stick of dyna
mite on top of a boulder. After the shot
the boulder is smashed to bits. But the
professor h;ui his own notions. He car
ried three round blocks of iron, six Inches
in diameter and three inches thick. Then
he took a newspaper from his pocket and
spread one sheet over the face of the
block. I placed half a stick of dynamite
on top and covered it with a little heap
of sand and touched her off. You would
hardly believe the result, but you can see
the block on exhibition in a glass case in
the Stevens Institute library, and you can
read on it distinctlyâ of course, the type
appears backwardâ the printing of that
part of tht paper which covered the block
at the time of the explosion. But the
professor had another wrinkle up his
sleeve. He picked an ordinary oak leaf
and spread it over the face of a second
block. I prepared a charge similar to
the first and this time the ribs of the
leaf and even its outlines appeared dis
tinctly pressed into the iron surface. Ac
cording to the professor, the action of
the dynamite was so quick that the ribs
of the leaf had not time to burst apart
before they were impressed on the iron.
In the case of the newspaper the printed
letters were harder than th surrounding
white of the paper, therefore the impres
sion.
"The professor's third block is not on
exhibition for the reason that we never
found a piece of it larger than a cloye â
and that reminds me. what do you say."
The reporter said "Yes."
HER DOG T__G.
It Gave the Little Dear Cold So She
Wore It Herself.
A few afternoons ago a tall young
woman, very smartly arrayed and with
an uncommonly large and varied assort
mpnt of clinking chatelaine articles at
tached to an amethyst-lncrasted gilt belt,
strolled down uptown Seventeenth street,
closely followed by a tiny, shivering,
cringing Chihuahua dog. The dog was
collarless, but wore a belt harness
trimmed with cerise ribbon. He difl not
permit himself to be left more than two
feet to the rear 01 his mistress' heels.
At one of the corners there was a sud
den rattle, and a caged wagon drew up
alongside the curb at the point where the
young woman and her dog were walking.
A big, black dog-catcher sprang from the
rear of the caged wagon, and in a trifle
less than no time the pampered little
Mexican dog was whimperingly strug
gling in the meshes of the dog-catchers
net. The dog-catchers transferred the
whining brute from the net to the wagon,
where a lot of large, coarse, common uog3
were already sullenly established.
The young woman owner of the cap
tured Chihuahua viewed the proceedings
with all the coolness in life. She adjusted
her eye-glasses carefully and looked the
dog-catcher over from head to foot. Then
she examined the plebeian dogs in the
wagon. The dog-catcher didn't know
what to make of her conduct. He ex
pected her to become hysterical and to
frantically demand the return of her pet.
But there didn't appear to be a hyÃteric
in her. She walked up to the dog-catcher.
"What do you think you are going to
do with that dog of mine?" she inquired
of him, in the most matter-of-fact tone
imaginable.
"Ah's dun swiped him. miss, 'codln' t'
law." replied the dog-cf#tcher.
"What for?" asked the young woman.
" 'Cause dey ain't no license on him,"
replied the dog-catcher.
"Is that so?" said the tall young
woman, quietly. "Well, you can just pass
that pup back to me. He has been
licensed.
"Ah'd laik tuh tek yo' wu'd fo' dat,
missy, but ah doan' see no tag, an' it' 3
de law dat "
"You can look at it now." replied the
captured pup's mistress, unsnapping one
of the clinking articles from her chate
laine belt. "It was among the first of the
year's issue, as you'll see by the number.
1 wear it myself because the chilly metal
gives Diaz a cold in the chest."
The dog-catcher looked at the tag,
grinned sheepishly, and reached in and
handed out the moaning Chihuahua to its
mistress.
"Dey'll be uh-wearin" de tags fo ear
rin's hex'," said the dog-catcher to the
driver of the wagon, as the young woman
and the rat-like pup disanpeared around
the corner.â Washington Post.
Resting Their IVJuscles.
\Then a man is tired he stretches his
arms and less and yawns. Birds and
animals so far as possible, follow his
example. Birds spread their feathers
and also yawn, or grape. Fowls often do
this. Fish yawn; they open their
mouths slowly till they axe round, the
bones of the head seem to loosen and
th>^ Kills open.
Dops are inveterate yawnerg and
stretchers, but seldom sneeze unless
they have a cold. Cats are always
stretching- their bodies, leps and claws.
aB e very one knows who has had a cat
for a pet.
Horses stretch violently when and
after Indulging in a roll, but not as a
rule on all fours as staps do. A stap
when stretching- sticks out his head,
stretches his forefeet out and hollows
his back and neck as thouph trying to
creep under a bar.
Most ruminant .-mimals stretch when
they rise up after lyinp down. Deer do
it regularly, so do cnttle. This fact is
so well known that if a cow when aris
ing from lyins down <loÂ«>s not stretch
hors^lf it i.-^ a sitrn she is ill. The rea
son for this is plainâ the stretch moves
ev-^ry muscle of the body, and if there
is an injury anywhere it hurts.

published sixteen novels in eleven

EASTERN MARKETS â¢
New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK, Aug. 12.â To-day's stock mar
ket started lower on London manifesting an
anxiety as to the future of the market. The
local bears fostered the depression, trying to
make capital of the situation in France and
predicting a Southwestern freight rate war.
The strong bank statement, however, changed
; the tone of the market and the close showed
; net gains in the more active stocks. In the
j early weakness the grangers and high-priced
! specialties were the principal sufferers. Sugar,
; Brooklyn Transit, People's Gas and American
I Steel and Wire declined a point each. The
, bears were disposed to cover at the decline
and prices rallied rather quickly, but remained
below last night's level. The dullness and
I hardness of the market which succeeded con
j tinued until the bank statement made its ap
pearance on the tape, when the market im
mediately burst into activity and delivered a
1 surprisingly buoyant tone at some points. The
stocks which had yielded most easily in the
j early transactions came back most readily, and
j as a rule they showed the best net gains .or
! the day. The shorts were In' a scramble to
cover and bid prices on themselves. Chicago
Great Western debentures soared upward "by
: successive jumps, selling at 103%. at least 5%
' above the lowest and 4% net advance. The
preferred stock of this company made a net
gain of 2%. Tennessee Coal also made a very
vigorous advance to S6, a net gain of 314; The
closing of the market was active and firm at
about the top.
What was generally expected to be a dull
i market for the week turned out to be a more
active one than for some time. The strength
I has been largely In spots and groups and has
| been not a little due to heavy covering opera
tions by large bear traders. At some points
j in the list there has been realizing going on
j at the same time and the readiness with which
: this was absorbed helped to lessen the bear
' ish sentiment. For the present money has be
j come slightly easier, and this has been a large
I factor in the strength of stocks of companies
i in the metal industries, particularly in the
Iron and steel industry. This was a logical |
response to the extraordinary conditions pre
vailing in that trade, where orders for deliv
ery in 1900 at the present high level of prices
1 are increasing, showing a growing confidence
I in the continuance of the eager demand for
1 iron and steel products. There has been special i
â  strength in other industrials, the causes of ;
! which have been left to guesswork by the gen- ,
eral public. The approach to the end of- the
period of anxiety regarding the crops has led
to some buying of the railroads in the grain
: market, the conviction having become general
that no setback to the country's prosperity
will arise from the year's results to the agri
: cultural industry. The outlook in the anthra
â¢ cite trade has led to strength in the group of
: railroads interested In the transportation
branch of that grade. A number of railroad
I stocks have enjoyed large gains from indi
vidual causes, such as. prospective increases
i of dividends or settlements of competitive traf
fic disputes or movements toward absorption
jby more powerful companies. The financial
i centers of the world have continued to pay
large attention to the developments of con
' ditions in the money market in this country,
'. and the foreign exchanges at New York have
moved strictly in response to the tone of the
local money market without regard to foreign
money centers. Thus the rates for both sterling
i and continental exchange fell on Tuesday to
the lowest level of the present movement, not
withstanding a jump of 4 per cent in the pri-
I vate discount rate at Berlin on Monday and
I hardening of a shade in the London rate on
; Tuesday. When the New York money market
began to tend toward greater ease later in the
I week there was a significant hardening in the
1 local rates for foreign exchange and the Bank
1 of England refrained from marking up its rate
of discount on Thursday.
The Treasury's payment with drafts on Â»h<Â»
i New York Sub-Treasury for gold deposits at
the San Francisco Mint has been an appre
ciable fact in the easing of the money mar
ket The principal cause was thÂ» offering of
1 funds in the New York market from domestic
i centers. The only effect on the rates was on
' those for call loans, lenders on time and bid
ders for commercial paper holding out stiffly
for the best rates and showing no anxiety to
j place loans at present rates. There Is not so
' much apprehension as recently of a money
i squeeze, but there is no general expectation
I that money rates will work lower.
! Bonds have been rather quiet and prices were
; irregular. United States new 4's have ad
! vanced 4 per cent in the bid price.

,Â« â Â»
NEW YORK, Aug. 12.â The Financier says:
The statement of the clearing house banks of
New York city for the week ending August 12
was unexpectedly favorable, the chief feature
having been the heavy increase of $6,38 i ! in
specie. There was a decrease of nearly the same
amount in loans' and as deposits remained sta
tionary the gold expansion went to swell sur
plus reserves and to bring that item to $14,
--39:. 375, the highest point touched since June
2-t last. There is no doubt that factors that
were present but unaccounted for in the previous
week have been operative in the present ex
hibit and the transfers of gold from the West
and the. return movement of specie recently
shipped to Canada may have aided in swelling
the total for the current week, but a detailed
analysis goes to show that four and a half mil
lions of the entire specie gain is reported by
one bank. This institution also expanded its
deposits by the same amount, so that the re- I
maining clearing house banks really curtailed
their outstanding deposits by that amount. It
in not known whether the lending of money In
this center by interior banks has Influenced
the statement. If such. ha 3 been the case the
loan column might be expected to show It.
Looked at In any light, however, the statement
will go far toward restoring a better feeling.
There has never been cause for apprehension
mi best, but the moral effect of a display of
strength such as chronicled will prove benefi
cial in every way. The main question at pres
ent is to what extent New York will be called
upon to aid in the crop movement. Best ad
vices now are that Interior cities are well pre
pared to handle the situation and that there
will be' little, if any, drain on New York. There
is nothing In domestic exchange quotations to
indicate a westward movement, and the season
is close at hand when cereals and cotton will
flow outward in Increased quantities. The July
figures now at hand show a decided gain In
domestic produce exports and August and Sep
tember are expected to make new records in
this respect, thus paving the way for gold im
ports later. '

CHICAGO. Aug. 12.â Wheat opened easy at *<
@4c under yesterday's close, September start-
Ing at 704<tr"0->Be. The chief Influence was the
i disappointing attitude of Liverpool, which
showed only a slight advance In the face of the
local bullishness yesterday. This indifference.
I it is supposed, was due largely to much-needed
I rains in India and to the generally favorable
Continental prospects. The decline -was brief.
Shorts, nervous from yesterday's domestic de
velopments, and still largely uncovered, were
active buyers at the opening decline. The
] Northwest also bought, and as selling was
i scattered the price advanced rapidly to "l^c
for September. The prospect of small world's
shipments was an aid to the "market. The
weather in the wheat-growing sections was re
ported favorable to crops, especially in the
â  Southwest, but this had little effect on the ap
: parently oversold market. After the shorts had
absorbed enough for their needs the price
eased off somewhat. September declining to
70Vi@7C%c under realizing, but buying was active
at the decline and the close was strong at 70 7 tÂ«c.
May was traded in to some extent and showed
: a closing advance of ? B c.
I Corn was steady, with only a moderate busi
ness. September closing unchanged.
Oats were dull and prices kept within a nar
row range; closing unchanged for September.
Provisions were firm at the opening and clos
ing with a weak Interval between, caused by
I realizing and selling by packers. The market
was sustained by an advance in hogs and the
strength of the grain markets. At the close
September pork was 5c higher, lard unchanged
an. l ribs 24c higher.

The advance was sympathetic with Chicago,
which, however, opened lower on disappointing
cables. The market became firm at the decline
under small offt-rings. News from the North
west was more bullish, it b^ing reported that

Hay and Feed stuffs.
Heavy receipts of 1017 tons depressed the Hay
market and prices were weak in consequence,

J Alfalfa Hay the circular of Scott & Manner
j says: "Arrivals, of Alfalfa Hay have been
; more liberal during this week and the market
has shown the result of such heavy arrivals
by a little easier feeling, prices being a little
off. Strictly gilt edge offerings have brought
from $7 25 to $7 50 per ton. The demand.
though, is fairly good and consignments have
moved off upon their arrival."
The circular of George Morrow & Co. says:
â¢ "Deduct Alfalfa shipments and the receipts
i cannot be called excessive. Under somewhat
! lighter receipts grain Hay of all kinds has been,
! a little steadier, but prices have remained un
! changed. The local demand for Hay seems to
: lag still and if there Is anything to Indicate
I an advance In prices in the near future we
cannot see it. We would like nothing better
j than to be able to do so. ...
"Alfalfa has been coming in quite freely this
I week, but the market has remained steady at
1 former figures.
"Compressed Hay has been in better supply
and there may be some little disposition to
! ease off In price, but it Is not at all pro
nounced."

Dried Fruits, Nuts and Raisins.
A ride from the Government orders for Ap
ples and Peaches already mentioned there is
little going on. Apricots continue to lead the
list in point of firmness. Apples are steady,
but Peaches are weak. There has been no
speculative buying of new Prunes thus far.
â which will be a good thing for the market later
on N Buyers might take hold if holders would
make concessions, but this they refuse to dc
under the present statistical condition of the
market. The seme conditions apply to new
Raisins, which are n*t talked about at all.

SLAP AT THE
STATE BOARD
OF HEALTH
No Sympathy for Its
Attitude.
SIGNIFICANT REQUEST MADE
CHAMBER OF COMMERCE IN THE
QUAF-ANTINE ROW.
Asks Governor Gage Not to Appro
priate Money With Which to
Tight the Federal
Officials.
The San Francisco Chamber of Com
m< rce haa taken a hand In the row be^
tween Federal quarantine officers ano the
I of Health and ih<? action of
trustees of the chamber has pn>vd to
â¢ ii slap at the Board of Health.
The action was no less ihan a request
Governor Gage refuse to appropri
ate money to help the State health officers
in their light against those of the Federal
lment. Many secret meetings have
â¢iy bex-n held by the quarantine
littee of the State board with the
â \ lew of devising ways and means of ob
g recognition from the United
3 officials in matters relating to local
quarantine.
SuKK<-^ii"iis were made that the only
way "f reaching tin- desired end is to
bring an action In the courts to determine
their rights. In order to even be able to
bring suit a â¢â¢subject" had to be found
and the committee l>elifÂ»ved that one had
. .ii 'ti> cas< of a Japanese
passenger on the steamer Hongkong
Maj-u. The man had ix-en here before,
but upon the fa*:t being learned that h<
was diseased United Slates Quarantine
Â«.>fficrr l'r. Kinyoun had him sent to the
station at Angel Island. State Quaran
tine Officer Conn ajid members of the
board determined to make an inveÂ«tiga~
lion In hopes (if finding- thai l>r. Kinyoun
had overstepped his authority.
W. H. I>. Barn< s Legal knowledge was
also brought into service, the suggestion
being to bring suit against the United
:!J^gal d^tpntion of the
Japa: So far all was wÂ«MI,
but th<n came the question of where the
would come from for the attendant
ex pen such a costly action. Of
â¢ the State would have to provide
the means and to this end a special com
sisting 'if Quarantine Officer
Cohn, Health Officer Dr. Lawlor and Dr.
â  hastened to Sacramento to Induce
Governor Gage to lend .'.is help by making
an .. Â«. The Governor, it is
sTfd. promised to assist to secure the
r rvi >.>gnition of the State's author
ity.
At this point thÂ»^ San Francisco Cham
ps in and the action
sp< cial meeting was
it surprise. Tlie matter was disi
and the general opinion was that
: Government is well and bet
le i" look after the quarantine reg
ns of this port than
and that the latter should not in
with the former.
In order that the position of the cham
might not be misunderstood a resolu
â¢ a letter be sent to
or ". ihi State requesting him
ny appropriation or t<
mit any money to be drawn from the
â¢ .ir any other fund for the
â¢ ihe quarantine service of the
Board of Health, as "it
was understood that a committee trom
H ilth was on its way
to ask for such an ap
propriation."

QUARTERMASTER BREVY
STABBED BY A SAILOR
AFFRAY ON THE TRANSPORT
CENTENNIAL.
Brevy Left at the Hospital in Naga
saki, and Charles Jackson, His
Assailant, Placed in Irons
on the Ship.
When the United States Government
transport Centennial arrives at this port
she will bring one of her crew, Charles
Jackson, in irons. He will be delivered to
United States Marshal Shine and a charge
of assault on the high seas with intent to
Inflict bodily injury will be preferred
against him.
Jackson*is a colored sailor. On July 21,
when the Centennial was nearing Naga
saki on her way from Manila, he and
Quartermaster Herman Brevy got into a
quarrel Brevy called Jackson a "nigger
and Jackson replied that a colored man
was just as good a? a white man and
probably a little better than a white man
of the Brevy brand. This expression ol
opinion infuriated the quartermaster and
he proceeded to pummel Jackson with his
lists. The negro retreated and on Brevy
following him up and again striking him
Jackson drew a sheath-knife and plunged
it Into Brevy's abdomen.
Brevy's injury was so serious that he
was discharged from the service and was
sent 10 St. Bernard's Hospital at Naga
saki for treatment. The American Con
sul at that port, after making an Investi
gation of the matter, ordered Jackson
placed in irons and delivered to the
i States Marshal in this city.
The papers arrived yesterday and were
handed to United States Attorney Coombs,
who instructed Assistant United States
Attorney Banning to take the necessary
steps to have Jackson's case presented
to the United States Grand Jury. It is
not believed that Jackson will be indicted,
it appearing from the depositions of the
witnesses that Brevy was the aggressor
and that the negro acted in self-defense.

Americano, the new papa tells over
and over again to the many that offer
him congratulations, and the tired
looking mother, propped up on a
woodeny couch and horsehair pillow,
smiles back "Americano."
Gonzalito looks much like other
babies. He ie extremely tiny and his
face is all puckered and pink. His
little body Is swathed in countless folds
of soft white Filipino wool, pinned
together with a brilliant-hued stom
acher. On his bald little head is a
grotesque little lace-edged cap and his
tiny hands are protected from the cold
In a pair of rudely fashioned square
topped white linen mitts.
l"p to the present Gonzalito has not
said anything: for publication, al
though It must be duly noted that
when he is called an "Americano" he
gives vent to a loud squawk which
his fond parents interpret as unquali
fied approval.

Discharges Forty-Six Men Employed

Sheehan Dismisses Twenty-
Six Clerks.
The tax levy adopted by the Board of
Surer-visors is causing considerable com
motion in the City Hall, and yesterday
afternoon forty-six men in the office of
the Superintendent of Streets were dis
missed, owlnf? to the fact that their de
mands had been returned by Auditor
Wells.
All these men are employed in the public
squares, and the Auditor refused to pass
the demands on the parks fund because
they exceeded the sum of $1500. Superin
tendent Frapley wanted the Auditor to
segregate the demands and allow up to
the $1300 limit, but he refused to do so,
and Fragley was obliged to pick out those
whom he desired for dismissal.

The Street L-ight Committee at its meet

'The main feature of the new plans is the
districting of the city, which will allow
the Mutual Light Company to enter into
the competition for bids. The board re
serves the right to use gas or electricity,
or both, in the various districts. Separate
contracts will be let for the lighting of
the public buildings.
The specifications call for fifty arc lights

J. B. Crockett, president of the Gas and
Electric Company, appeared before the
! committee and gave certain information
regarding the plans. In his answers, he
took occasion to say:
"It appears to me useless to prepare
these plans, as it is mure than likely that
there will be no bids unless the city pays
its bills."
Mr. Crockett evidently referred to the
fact that there is .iwing to his company
something like $100,000.
Another difficulty in the way of provid

tion has been made for that purpose, and
in the unsettled state of the city's finances
none is likely to be forthcoming-.

There is a tribal saying, "A Yaqul
always remembers a kindness." But,
true though this most certainly Is. he
never repays a favor half so eagerly
and gladly as he repays an Injury, nor
with a rate of interest anywhere near
â¢o high.
Deal him an injustice, thwart him in
any heart-cherished plan, defraud him
In any way of what he considers to be
his special rights, and he will spend his
lifetime, If need be, In the effort to â
With as little risk to himself, of course,
as is possibleâ accounts with you
In such a way as to leave a big bal
ance in his own favor. Should death
Unfortunately intervene and prevent
him from giving his personal attention
to the matter of straightening out the
little difficulty between you and him
Â»elf, his children are only too happy to
me the responsibilities which he,
h against his own will, has been
forced to lay aside. And if they, in
turn, â¢ mselves unaLi
ly discharge the debt of t<- .
with which they have voluntarily bur
: themselves, It is handed down to
come after them; and until
it is liquidated In full, Incipal
Interest, you and your u
are never for a moment out from
the brooding shadow of
danger.
Had it not been for this character.
Istlc of the Yaquis E. N. Miller and
Jack Ramsey would undoubtedly be
alive to-day instead of beir.^. as they
are, hideous charred fragmei I
humanity, exemplfying in th^ horror
of their deaths the devilish savagery of
the Indian natures which for years
have masqueraded in the garb of civ
ilization.
Ever since the conquest of Mexico
by Cortez the work of the priests
among the Mexican Indians has been
constant and untiring, and the Yaquis
have especially distinguished them~
selves In a religious way by their zeal
and earnestness in all that pert;::
churchly work and observances. They
have b-'en baptized, married and buried
by the holy men who have devoted th^ ir
lives to the task of visiting, instruct
ing and counseling them; and to all ap
pearance, up to the last few years, they
were the most sincere and devout of
converts. It has been their custom,
so anxious have they seemed to have
the sanction of religion for all their
acts, to have or.c of th<Mr own number,
generally the best educated man of
the tribe, appointed to represent the
priest officially when he was unable to
be with them in person, and to this
"maestro," as he is called, they have
yielded the most unquestioning defer
ence and obedience.
A history of the Yaquis which was
written by their present tribal ruler.
Governor Corral, states that they are
the furthest advanced of any of the
Mexican tribes and have proved them
selves the most capable of learning and
practically applying the useful arts of
civilization. For many years the men
and women have worn conventionally
fashionable garments made of cotton
or wool which the men have raised
themselves and the women have carded
and spun and woven on home-made
looms. The men have learned to be
skilled machinists, successful farmers,
hardy sailors and pearl fishers, and the
women have earned honest and decent
livings by their spinning wheels and
looms, their needles, or by performing
domestic service in the families of per
sons able to pay for such work-
Up to the year 1887 the civilization of
the Ya<jul seemed to have been, a moat
successful experiment and was a causa
of much self-congratulation among his
white brethren; bur. the story of the>
ears' insurrection under Chief Te
te, which followed that first fatal
uprising, shows that the Indian heart
had always beaten slow and sullen
under the thin cloak or â  I con.
with which it had suited him to
seem to clothe himself for a time.
Truly "the Yaqui never forgets," for
little wrong carelessly Inflicted,
every trifling injustice, every small ex
hibition of tli" white man's greed in the
matter of lands oi hdise had
1 away along with welgl
rebellion, and when once the
v rch of war was applied to the stead
ily growing pile the fierce flames leapt
high toward the heavens ar.'l turned the
leaden grayneÃS of the lowering clouds
Into an ominous crimson which only
too truly foretold of bloody battles to
come.
It was during this rebellion against
the Mexican Government that the seed
was planted which, after lying dor
mant all through the two years of ap
parently smiling peace which followed
â  g of the treaty in 1^97, has
shouldered its way to the surface and
burgeoned and budded and blossomed
and just now borne its noxious fruit
the light of God's sunshine down
in the beautiful Sierra Madre
Mountains in the Mexican State of
ra.
If Jack Ramsey, a small merchant
of the city of Hermosillo, had not, dur
ing the last part of the "ten years'
war," felt it to be either his duty or
his pleasure, or both, to communicate
to the Mexican military authorities cer
tain facts which came into his posses
sion', there would have been nothing
especial for even an Indian to have
remembered about him.
He was a jovial, companionable,
;! kind of a fellow, well liked by
most of those with whom he came in
contact, but he was possessed of an
adventurous spirit which found little
outlet in the dull routine of his avoca
tion, and it suited himâ not being over
fond of Indians as a race and particu
larly disliking their methods of war
fare â to do some little detective busi
ness on his own account. The result
of his quiet investigations was some
particularly valuable information which
enabled the Government troops to frus
trate a contemplated strategic move of
their savage enemies and rout them
entirely in the next encounter which
took place between them.
The Indians considered that Ram
sey's interference in the matter of the
temporary disagreement between them
and the Government was both meddle
some and unpleaslng. The^ went fur
ther even and solemnly declared among
themselves that he was responsible for
every drop of Indian blood which was
Bhed in that disastrous battie which
had followed his betrayal of them to
their foes.
From the day that they deliberately
and si rived at this unalt< i
ision Jack Ramsey was a doomed
â 
Xo thought of thiÂ«, however, cv
his mind. He had done his duty
It, and having d me it the
jiffair became a matter of the
: â â  was pro< laimed. The t â 
guaranteeing safety from any further
outbreak was signed. Every Yaqui
who promised to be "pood" was given
a certain amount of land and an op
portunity, did he wish it, to obtain a
thorough knowledge of some branch
of Industry, together with an abund
ance of supplies to keep him In health
and comfort until such a time as he
: t or outgrew the desultory and
itory habits acquired through a
le of warfare and became once
again a respectable, steady- going per
son, industrious and self-supporting aa
of old.
Jack Ramsey went on with his bust
ness affairs serenely and contentedly
and with no Busplcion of the truth
shadowing his honest heart. It never
occurred to him that every stolid In
dian face that he saw was but a con
i lava crust hiding for the tlms
5 a smoldering and seething vol
cano of hatred which was but waiting
for strength enough to burst out and
overwhelm him.
lie never dreamed that every piece of
money and every scrap of merchandise
or barter that passed from Indian hand
to his brought with it a curse aa deep
and deadly as hell itself.
J;irk Ramsey was of a nationality
which forgets, but his enemies were
Yaquis.
T'nsuspicious though he was, how
ever, fate, who oft< n Cor a time seems
to exert herself to save the careless
fir the Ignorant from the consequences
of their own Indiscretions, seemed to
watch over him and prevent him from
falling into the hands of those to whom
his very existence was an offense that
they would never forgive.
He came and went as he would, tak
ing no thought of himself or of possi
ble danger because he never dreamed
that hate was dogging his footsteps-,
but careless as he was it always hap
pened that it was never quite possible
for his foes to work a fitting reveng*
upon him without incurring the cer
tainty of disproportionate trouble for
themselves m reprisal.
The> were a peaceful nation now,
supposedly, and reaping many benefit*
because of that supposition. Life was
longâ if the portion of the Individual
failed he could leave the story, with its
y of hate, to the next in sueces
and be sure that some day it
would be brought to a fitting and satis
factory concluFi"n. Meanwhile Jack
Ramsey was well and strong and
hearty, and thos<* who hated him could
afford to wait. They waited for nearly
three years.

the indeterminate roads i-r the less
settled districts with no guidance save
his own general ideas of A
congenial companion, moreover, always
makes even a pleasant Journey ;
anter, and so it was that, most unfor
tunately for b"th of them as it proved,
Mr. Miller proposed to Jack Ramsey to
make the trip to Alamos with him in
his commodious and well-stocked buck
board drawn by two strong and spirited
young horses.
The men started out under the hap
piest auspices. The weather was per
fect; their outfit all that could be de
sired and the prospect before them of
several days of riding and working and
camping together was most satisfac
tory to both. There was no hint of any
impending trouble In the air when they
gayly said good-by to the little group
of loungers who gathered to see them
off on that bright morning, there was
no thought of even a possibility of evil
in either heart as Mr. Milk r gathered
up the reins and started hi 3 horses on
their southward way.
The Sierra Madres are steep and the
roadways are rugged. It was slow
driving, but the scenery is so mag
nificent that all difficulties of prog
are forgotten in the delight of pro
longed vision. The trip was enjoyable
to the highest degree, both from an ar
tistic standpoint and aa an experiment
in companiortshlp, and every one who
saw the two envied them the care-free
happiness which was so evidently
theirs. Not until they wre nearly at
the end of their expedition did the
thunder-clap of doom sound in their
unbelieving ears.
The Indian nature loves to play cat
like with its victims. It has a theatri
cal appreciation of the value of con
trasts and high and low lights. The
swift descent from the heights of hap
piness to the depths of despair adds
much in the savage mind to the desira
bility of a situation. To merely kill for
the sake of removing an obnoxious in
dividual from this state of being is a
very stale and uninteresting perform
ance. Though they are not specially
prone to the use of condiments on their
food they like their revenges highly
spiced.
Unknown to the two white men the
Taqui rebellion, long-smoldering, had
broken out while they, unconscious
even that it had been planned, were
peacefully pursuing their way to their
destination, now comparatively near at
hand. Unknown to them, by means of
the lecxet telegraphy bo well under
stood In all savage nations, the very
moment of their setting forth had been
noted, and every turn of their carriage
wheels had been marked by some un
se< n but vengeful eye.
The Yaqui rebellion, much as It
means to Mexico, meant from the first
all eternity to one man and that man
was Jack Ramsey. Had not another
man been killed in the uprising he could
not have escaped, for with the first
whisper of discontent that had stirred
among the sullen braves his name had
been coupled and his fate been sealed.
It wraa not, however, the Taquis pian
to act hastily. From the hour of their
leaving the city the two white men had
been utterly in the Indians power,
but because they took a grim pleasure
in seeing their prospective victims so
unconscious of the horror that each
breath was bringing nearer to them
they had allowed them to proceed upon
th.lr way until it seemed to their self
appointed executioners that In the tit
ness of things the time for the end had
arrived. . Â
When Jack Ramsey's eyes fell on
the first Indian who stepped out from
behind a bush and leveled a rifle at
him he knew that the hour of his
death had come. When he saw that
every bush had been a shelter for an
Indian, and that the road was sud
denly full of them, no longer habited
in the garments of civilization, but clad
only in stained and hideously painted
*ki ; :s decorated with human scalps,
with bristling feathers taking the place
of hats and necklaces of human teeth
and snake rattles taking the place or
the pumpkin-seed and bead adornments
of peaceful times, he knew that an up
rising had taken place and that many
others beside himself were destined to a
cruel d-^ath at the hands of these malig
nant and merciless creaturesâ savages
still and of the wickedest type, in spite
oi all that had been done to reclaim
them lie knew the Yaquis well, and
he knew as he saw their fierce eyes
bent upon him with demoniac joy that
there was in store for him torture as
excruciating as their ingenious minds
could plan. He had heard during the
previous war of their cutting off the
ears and noses of their victims, and
then their fingers and tcres one by one.
He had heard of their searing the flesh
of their captives with hot irons and
setting fire to their hair. He himself
had once come upon a party of them
engaged in the pleasing operation of
burning a man at the stake. The scalps
and human teeth which adorned them
were, he knew, mementoes of past bar
barities, but what Bpecial form erf suf
fering was destined for him he could
not know; he only knew that it would
be intense â slow, if possible â and In
the end fatal.
It was Miller's misfortune that he
had selected him for a comrade, for by
this act he had signed his own death
â¢warrant. The Indians hated Ramsey,
and they reasoned that any man who
â would associate with him on terms of
friendliness was of his kind and there
fore deserving of similar punishment.
Resistance was useless, for two men
against 200 could do nothing. It is re
ported that Ramsey, scorning to aak
mercy for himself, begged for the 11XÂ«
of hi? companion, but to no avail. T%Â»
two were dragged to the ground, kicked,
cuffed and beaten almost to the verfÂ»
of Insensibility, and then a council wu
held to determJn* their ultimata dis
posal. The motive power of horsÂ«i and
carriage was there, and they had or.oe
re tried the experiment ot tyln*
persona to the wheels of a vehicle and
starting the horses on a wild runaway
over these mountain roads.
That had been a long time ago, and
the people upon whom they had tried
the effect of this form of torture â they
were a young married couple on a
pleasure trip â had become Insensible
after the first few bounds of the flee
ing horses, and the delight of seeing
their unconscious bodies mangled
against rocks and trees had been a
qualified and chastened one, sine* after
the initial moments the victim* had
knawn no pain.
The torture of these two men man
be far greater, for one of them had
sinned against the tribe and the other
had sinned In â though all Ignorant
of his offending â giving him the hand
of friendship. Ramsey, by betraying
them, had caused the slaughter of
many of their best braves, and In re
quital he must render up a sacrifice
of his keenest suffering that they
could, with the means at hand, devise,
and Incidentally Miller must contribute
his share of agony to the ceremony of
expiation.
The two men were stripped and
bound to the wagon wheels with heavy
chains, drawn so tightly as to cut Into
the flesh at every point of contact.
Inflammable oil was then poured liber
ally over their heads and bodies and
over the wagon to which they were
fastened and then the whole horrible
funeral pyre was set ablaze.
Strong hands held the frantlo horses
until the eyes of the 200 leaping , danc
ing, shrieking, howling demons "were
satiated with the sight of those two
piteous white bodies in their garments
of scorching, seething, searing flame,
writhing and twisting and bending In
the vain effort to shorten their agonies
by forcing death to come more quickly.
But the Indians had done their work
so skillfully that for a time death stood
aloof and looked on with them at this
soul-sickening spectacle of hideous and
untrameled savagery.
At last, however, even this sight
palled upon the on-lookers, eager to
run the whole gamut of horrors, and
then fire was applied to the oil-soaked
backs of the plunging horses, the In
dians sprang away into safety before
their maddened onrush, and down the
mountain road they fledâ blazing hor
ror of human and brute agony, a fiery
chariot within which death rode tri
umphant, while fiends incarnate held
the charring reins.
The next morning the inhabitants of
Alamos found, just outside the limits
of the town, all that was left of men
"and horses â a shapeless mass of cin
dered bone and flesh and twisted
chainsâ horror to haunt their dreama, t

FIRTST FILIPINO CIRCUS AND VILLAGERS
EVER
IN THE
UNITED
STATES
THE SUNDAY CALIi.
7-^HF. vi it to San Francisco and appearance at the forthcoming Mechanics'
[nstltute Pair of the royal circus and villagers of the Philippine Islands is
;,!, event uuhiue of Its kind and, therefore, well calculated to arouse more
than :i passing int. rest in the minis of the general public.
Never before In the history of these fair and far-away Islands have any of
their Inhabitants pi\en the world outside their comparatively small domain an
opportunity of learning aught of their customs, habits or amusements save by
the expensive and fatiguing means of personal travel or through the unsatisfac
tory medium of books.
Our visitors represent two distinct classes of the Filipino raceâ one the
trained public performers, the other the rustic and uncultured villagers who ply
their simple arts Just 4a their forefathers have done in nil tho years pone past.
Between the villagers and the circus people, however, there is a great gulf
nx*,i. The villagers are as friendly and companionable as good-natured, un
spoiled children, but the circus m> ;i and women will have none of them. There
fore the villagers and the proud "professionals" eat, work and spend their hours
of idleness as strictly apart as if a matt rial and insurmountable barrier was
raised between them.
Quite the "cutest" member of rhe aggregation Is Its mascot, the little four
weeks-old Mascot, who was horn at sea and <â ; a Sunday, and well deserves Its
name in that It is particularly bright and Interesting and a general favorite
wherever seen. "Hercules," one ol the three champion strong men. and little
"Cuyid," his special pet and protege, are also particularly important persons in
their own lines, and. moreover, are well awnre "f that fact. The only thing that
struck blase two-year-old "Cupid's" fancj during his ride up from the ferry tn.e
of his arrival on these fchores was tho majestic Call building, the magnifi
cent proportions of which evidently :ill<il his \outhful soul with awe. since it
caused him to splutter excited infantile fragments of his native dialect all the
way to the Pavilion.

Manila "dune" and heartbreaker, and the musician who does not know a note of
written music but has playi I ;< French horn by ear and led the Manila band
for twenty years, were persuaded, much against the will of the band leader, who
considers that he belongs to the superior class, to have their pictures taken
together, with a result gratifying to themselves and the artist.
Taken altogether, our Phiitppine visitors seem to be specimens of a docile and
good-tempered race, two of whose < hlef characteristics are an inordinate love of
really good cigarettes and a certain innocent conceit which is as engaging as
the firs; Belf-appreciation at a petted child.
The trirk poniesâ stout and shaggy little fellows â .are quite a feature of their
oddly attractive entertainment, but the three b/uge*water buffalos, or earabao, as
they are called In Tin: Philippines, will probably more than rival them In the
estimation of the American public. Thesi; massive creatures, with their immense
low-spreading horns and .slow and clumsy movements, are. the chief dependence
of thi? native Filipinos of the peasant class. Living, they bear all the burdens
and do all the work of the community which holds them prisoners, and dead, their
coarse-grained but nourishing flesh forms a staple article of food for those
whose chief support they have been In life.
The efforts of these three strange and uncannily fierce-looking creatures to
break away from their keepers when they were first landed on the water front,
in order to enjoy a bath in the salt water, nearly created a stampede of the
crowd which gathered to gaze at them. It is reassuring to know that in spite o*
their forbidding appearance, they are as gentle and as lazy as over-fed kittens,
and that even littla "Cupid" can rldÂ« upon their backs and guide them as ho

I HAVE been out to dinner.
Now to merely be invited out to
dine is not, I grant you, a very
wonderful thing, even in the career
of a newspaper worker. But to be
a guest at such a dinner as fell to my
lot upon this special occasion is of a
verity an event.
I was bidden â in a commonplace,
prosaic way â to an ideal feast, given
by an ideal host and hostess in an ideal
establishment within which no kitchen
has a place!
The sun had been all day casting its
most ardent glances through the clear
California air upon beautiful Alameda,
and all nature in that locality looked
not a little tired and overheated. My
hostess, however, though she is from
choice her own maid-of-all-work, met
me at the door arrayed In the crispest
and freshest of organdies, and with no
more than the usual faint hint of color
upon her rather thin but smiling face.
"You look delightfully cool, but you
shouldn't have troubled to get a 'com
pany dinner' on such a day as this!" I
declared conti'itely. "I would not have
come if -I had not promised. It must
be little short of martyrdom to be
chained to a cookstove in such weather
as this!"
"It isn't at all short of it," was the â
in these days of conventional and in
sincere politeness â unexpected and
rather discomposing reply.
There cannot be much real enjoyment
In a meal over the preparation of which
one's hostess has fcund reason to feel
like this. But it was too late to re
treat with dignity, however much I
wished to hie me to other scenes.
One week before I had been fortunate
enough to accompany Mr. ' and Mrs.
Danford A. Henshaw during one of
their long but enjoyable rambles over
hill and dale in search of new worlds
to conquer in the shape of picturesque
bits of scenery which they might make
their own by the simple process of a
snapshot. We had met on the sympa
thetic plane of mutual camera enthu
siasm, and before we parted I ha<:
honored by an invitation to dinner.
"It won't be at all the kind of
a dinner you are accustomed to,"
Mrs. Henshaw had said, with, how
ever, no hint of apology in her
tone or manner, "but it will be whole-
Eome and good, and, I assure you
reaily just the kind of a repast
which you ought always to eat.
â¢I am sorry you broiled yourself for
me." I said feebly as I followed the
crisp organdie into the pleasant \
where Mr. Henshaw awaited us. "The
dinner in the world wouldn't pay
f :â¢ that."
"We've got the very best dinner in
the world, I promise you," declared he.
as he ruse to welcome me, "but my wife
didn't broil or bake or boil or fry her
ver it â in fact, we haven't a cook
stove in the house, so she couldn't if
dad wished to. Ours is a home
without a kitchen, you see."
A home without a kitchen! My
tal barometer f- a !l tremendously,
for I had eaten "sent in" dinners be
and considered them a delusion
and a snare, having generally found
them about as savory and appetizing
as chips and sawdust.
The dining-room was very cool and
Americans Versus Chinese
Pupils in Our Public Schools

Sunday can First to present *he pa C*S *n the Case-
THE "Sunday Kxaminer Magazine"
of August 6. !n an article entitled,
"Chinese Boy Gains Highest Pr-r
--centage In San Francisco Public
Schools," has placed the Chinese
public school of this city in a false
light and has most grossly misrepresent
ed the capabilities of our own little sons
and daughters.
The indignant protest that has arisen
from the School Department and from
: rs and mothers upon all sides war-
pleasant, and the small table in the
middle of the floor, spread with the
finest and snowiest of linen, shining
silver, polished glass and delicate
china, looked very inviting.
In the center of the table was a tall
cut-glass dish of mixed fruitsâ oranges,
apples, peaches, apricots and pears.
Flanking it on one side was a large
platter of bananas, and on the other
a pitcher of graceful shape full of the
foamiest and creamiest of milk. A
glass bowl of strawberries, a dish of
daintily shred lettuce, a i-late of rais
ins, a little delft dish of cream cheese,
and a china vegetable dish full of
cracked almonds, pecana md walnuts,
completed save for plates and glasses
and the accompanying cutlery and
napkinsâ the furnishing forth of the
festal board.
It was quite evident, I thought, that
I had fallen Into the hands of a pecu
liar people who preferred, for seme oc
cult reason, to cat their dinners back
ward as it were. We were evidently
going to eat our dessert first, and fo.
as I always pride myself upon my
adaptability to circumstances, I ac
cepted a glass of the milk and some of
the nuts, Intending to amuse myself
politely with them until the dinner it
self appeared.
But alas and alas, for the hollow un
der my shirt v. aist, which the hour,
Ined with the trip across the bay,
had made to feel like unto the Mam
moth cave! There was no further din
ner forthcoming. These nuts and
fruits and gentle lacteal accompani
ment? were the alpha and omega of
the entertainment; and while telling
m^ this my entertainers gazed at me
with the lieht of beneficent compassion
in their clear eyes, because In truth
they could not but know that my
r nature Becretly craved the
soup and fish and meats and vege
tables and pastry of the ordinary un
regenerate cvi :>\ne meal.
"We have lived in this way for eigh
teen years." declared Mr. Henshaw,
beaming at me benevolently â "ever
since we were married, in fact, and be
that hairy esrent I lived in this
same way ever after I arrived at years
..f discretion. It is, I firmly believe,
the only proper and thoroughly satis
factory" way of nourishing the body."
"And you never eat meat?" My host
shook his head as decidedly as if I had
asked him if he made a practice of eat
ing mice, ami a shadow of disgust
passed over his wife's delicately ex
pr< BSive countenance. "Nor fish?"
Again the panorama of shake and
shadow. "Nor"â this llngeringly, be

tions- "cakes, n r pies, nor puddings?â
Oh. dear:- How can you?"
"Nor bread, nor cooked things of any
description, in fact. And we <irink no
tea nor coffee, nor anything <>f that
kind, and we use no stimulants what
ever; and we do it very easily, I assure
you."
Ami you can live, and work and be
happy on a continuous diet of such
things as these?"
"We have done so together for
eighteen years," repeated Mr. Ken

the general unintelligibility of the article.

Mrs. Henshaw here passed me a plate
of salad, which, being dressed only
with pepper, salt and oil, I found myself
unable to really enjoy. She also placed
a generous slice of the cream cheese
upon my plate, and gave me a heaping
saucer of strawberries. I looked about
for a sugar-bowl, but was doomed to
disappointment.
"We never eat sugar," said Mrs.
Henshaw, noticing my visual search
among the dishes and speaking sweetly
enough almost to make up for the miss
ing article. "Saccharine foods are
quite as bad for the stomach as meats
and starchy edibles. They all tend to
create an unnatural appetite for liquids,
and are exciting rather than soothing
and nourishing in their effect upon the
general system."
"It was never intended that artificial
heat should be applied to anything de
signed to enter the stomach. The chem
ical changes caused by such applica
tion render even fruits and grains unfit

tended.
"Hananas are the most satisfying
fruits of all," declared Mrs. Henshaw,
peeling a large, fat one deftly as she
spoke, "and apples are nnet;r t ; after them

peaches, oranges, pomegranates and all
kinds of berries and grapes. Then nuts

see."
It seemed rather a narrow one to me,

trusive range, but I chewed a raisin

firmly and reflectively and said nothing
in dissent.
It is, of course, delightful for a
â¢woman to be emancipated from the
thralldom of a cook-stove. A house
which contains no kitchen and never
harbors within its walls the reek of
steam, the c-dor of fried onions or boiled
cauliflower or burning fat or any other
cooking-produced smell which wages
aggressive warfare on sensitive nostrils,
must be pre-eminently satisfactory in
one way; but in another it certainly
could never be to me. Mrs. Henshaw
rejoices in the extra time which her
freedom from the heaviest burden o-f
housewifely care gives her. There is
no storm of preparation raging about
her exquisitely served repasts, and no
deadly, monotonous calm of "clearing
up" follows after them. Her regimen,
she declares, gives her a clear mind in
a sound body, and time to read and
study and think. She stands shoulder
to shoulder with her husband as a
bread-winner, and their marriage,
which took place at eea and was a ro
mantic "love match" between a pretty
native daughter of Santa Cruz and a
man Jhirty-five years her senior, has
been a particularly happy one.
Mr. Henshaw, who owns to 70, and
has eaten only nuts and uncooked
fruits and grains for over forty years,
looks like an astonishingly well-pre
served and vigorous man of 50, and his
pretty wife, who is really 35, looks like
a girl in her twenties.
I thought of this as I was wending
my way restaurant-ward after parting
from my kind and hospitable acquaint
ances, and for a moment hesitated. But
hunger was strong within me. I touk
my seat in my usual corner, and gazed
unflinchingly in the mirror beside me
at the hint of crow's feet in the outside
corners of my eyes.
"I might look young at 70 if I ate only
raw things," I reflected, "and hay?
more time to improve my mind .ilso;
but"â and here I shudderedâ "l should
be starving hungry every blessed min
ute of the time"'
And then I ordered my dinner.
CLARA DOUGLASS.
97; then again, "IN TITH FOURTH
GRADE (PRIMARY) AN INDIVID
UAL PERCENTAGE OF 99 WAS AT
TAINED." â
In other words In Its own story the Ex
aminer puts Wong Bock Yue a* the "top
notch pupil" at 97 per cent, and then im
mediately makes a statement that an
other little Chinese boy had 99 per cent.
WHY WAS NOT THE FOURTH
GRADE BOY AT 99 PER CENT GIVEN
CREDIT ABOVE THE SEVENTH
GRADE BOY. WHO ONLY RECEIVED
VI PER CENT? It further states:
"There Is a daily attendance of about
37,000 pupils In the San Francisco public
schools. Wong Book Yue has, approxi
mately, 36.999 competitors. He holds a
higher record than any."
Wong Bock Yue could easily give the
Examiner a little lesson in arithmetic.
He could tell them that 97 is not as h<Kh
a percentage as 99 and also that a class,
the highest member of which had 97. could
hardly be credited with making "a school
record of 100 per cent."
Miss Thayer, the principal of the Chi
nese school, upon being questioned ex
pressed the greatest regret that such an
article had appeared, placing the Chinese
boys in a false light and at the expense
of the white children of the city. In
Bpeaking of the matter she said:
"A YOUNG MAN CAME HERE FROM

"I HAVE BOYS HERE 6 YEARS OLD.
THE CHINESE ARE NOW BEING EN
ROLLED AT RELATIVELY THE
SAME AGE OF WHITE CHILDREN."
The Chinese boys have done well under
Miss Thayer's able supervision and they
deserve credit, but not to the detriment
of the white children.
Now for the truth of the matter and
the exact relative standing of Chinese
and white school children as AERIFIED
BY THE OFFICIAL RECORDSâdis
regarding the emanations of the fertile
brain of a Sunday Examiner scribe.
Robert Dougherty, who had 94 per cent,
did not attain "the highest average of
any white student," for ALMA TADD
OF THE SIXTH GRADE IN THE
HAIGHT SCHOOL HAD !>9 PER CENT,
5 per cent higher than Robert Dougherty
and 2 per cent higher than Wong Bock
Yue,
Wong Bock Yue had his average beaten
in his own school and by his own country
men, for in the fourth grade Vim Dye
Kee and Chan Bing Gay both had 99 per
cent.
Now with reference to the relative men
tality of the white children and the Chi
nese youngsters a close comparison can
be drawn by another glance at the offi
cial records.
In Wong Bock Yue's class there were
but seven pupils and these had averages
as follows: No. 1. 97: No. 2. 95; No. 3, 94;
No 4, 94: No. 5, 92; No. 6, 90; and No. 7,
84. Adding these averages together and
Wife's House. Where Marriage Occurred, and Where They Will RÂ«slde
dividing: by 7 gives a class average of
92 2-7 per cent.
In Alma Tadd'a class at the Haight
School Miss Mary A. Haswell principal
and Miss C. Sweeney teacher, the aver
ages were as follows: No. 1, 99; No. 2,
97 4-.",; No. 3, 97 3-5,- No. 4, 97 1-5; No. 5,
97 1-3; No. 6, 97 1-5; and No. 7, 97; which
gives an average for the first seven in
the class of 97 4-7 per cent, or 5 2-7 PER
CENT HIGHER THAN THE CELES
TIALS. In other words, the first seven
of the Haight School class did as well as
and even better than Wong Bock Yue.

YJ narlan the Rev. David Davis of
M Summerland Is a bridegroom, and
A last Sunday night the whole town
gathered to rejoice with him and
wish him many additional years of Ufa
In which to enjoy his new-found happi
ness.
At this reception, in addition to other
guests, there were four generations of tha
families of the Just married couple, the
great-great-grandchild of Mr. Davis, re
cently born in Florida, being too young
to take the Journey across the continent,
even with so laudable an object In view
as offering congratulations In person to
his aged relative.
Mr. Davis has been for years a spirit
ualist lecturer, and before entering that
ftith was for a long time- a clergyman
In the Congregational Church. His Im
promptu speech, delivered In response to
the address of congratulation made By
Rev. M. E. Taylor, who officiated at the
wedding, convinced every one who heard
It that he has lost little If any of the
forensic flre with which he hits electrified
audiences since his early youth.
Though lacking only nine years of the
century mark Mr. Davis Is still sprightly
and is able to run up and down the hills
surrounding Summerland, on which are
the homes of his children and the children
of his wife. He is over six feet tall and
bears himself erect; his eyesight Is good,
and his memory remarkable, taking him
back even to the days before the war with
England in 1812 and 1813.

where many of her family still reside.
Several of her children are residents of
San Francisco, where also live a num
ber of her grandchildren and great-grand
children. She carries her eighty-six years
lightly and speaks with confidence of
many more to come, as her father, s>he
state*, met an untimely death at the age
of 109, being killed by a falling tree
Irranch while he was at work In the
woods. This Is her fourth voyage on the
matrimonial sea. She was 50 years old
when her youngest daughter, Mrs. Kemp
ton, was married, and Mrs. Kempton in
now a grandmother. These generations
live In cottages clustered about that in
which the newly married couple will
dwell and above these, on the same hill,
is the home of George Davis, a son of tho
groom, whose roof shelters as many gen
erations of the Davis family. Recently a
reunion of the Day's family was held, at
which there were present nlnety-slx de
scendants of the Rev. David Davis. Mrs.
Davis positively knows of but twenty
three direct descendants, although Bhe la
certain that her family is very large.
The bride Is owner of the cozy little
home in which the marriage took placo
and here the couple will hereafter live.
Mr. Davis draws a pension from the Gov
ernment for the death of a son tn the
Civil War and this, with othÂ«r email
means, makes them Independent of their
many offspring. FRED T. DUEN.
SCHOOL WHOM THE EXAMINER EX
PL OfTED AS THE HIGHEST WHITE
CHILD- AND A GREAT MANY RE
CEIVED OVER 97 PER CENT.
In the Chinese seventh grade there, are
only seven pupils and all of the seven,
were promoted; but it is hardly fair to
credit such a small class with a "school
record of 100 per cent" when the white
classes are so much larger. Alma Tadd'a
class comprised forty-six and of that
number only one failed In the examination
for promotion and three were held on ac
count of absence through sickness or oth
er causes So our boys and girls are not
nearly so stupid as the Examiner would
have the world think.

Breakfast Table Incorrectly Laid.
The stomach is long suffering and kind,
but hot omnipotent. The salivary glands
are her natural and most efficient allies.
"bolter" tK's off supplies from t.ie
source. The chunks of solid matter,
1 d wn with scalding liquid or iced
. more than the other gastric
- can manage. The result is as srre
as the addition of two and two followed
I y the subtraction of four.
A judicious rr.other, who has made
phy3io] gy a Btudy for her children's
hes her little ones to chew the
well-cooked cereals that form the sta; le
of their breakfast. Furthermore, that it
is indecent to swallow anything except
liquids without chewing it. Tin : ule is
not arbitrary. Ea< h child comprehends
th* office of the saliva, that the an
of chrwing- excites it. and that ' tee
crude lumps of anything into the torn:, h
is absolutely wrong.
In '.he chance that other mothers may
imitate her example lies the only hopf of.
the American stomach. The adult bolter
is joined to his evil practice. HÂ» is feed

Comforts.
Big, fluffy, seneible outdoor pillows and
cushions, with strong washable covers,
are now counted among the rerjulsites of
summer indispensables. They must not
be fashioned for show, but for "solid com
fort." And whether the home is surroun*-
Ed by shady hammock-hung trees and
roomy porches, or simply the one tiny
porch over the front door, cozy nooks can
be surely found somewhere where ham
mneks can be stretched, and cushions and
pillows and easy-chain will invite repose.
In planning those lounging comforts, in
the way of cushion* and pillows the first
consideration should be durability. When
In daily use on the porch or in the ham
mock they will Boon In-come soiled and
will be very unsatisfactory unless made
of durable and washable material. A
pretty hammock pillow not only adds ad
ditional comfort, but gives a touch of col
or that is charming. A material must be
selected that will not fade when exposed
to the bud nor lose color and beauty if
left out in an occasional shower. The btst
materials are Turkey-red of the best qual
lf. blue -l.'nim and gray linen.
An attractive hammock pillow recently
finished had a cover of Turkey-red
stamped in what in called a starfish pat
tern then outlined In white working-cot
ton On the reverse side were the own
er> initials worked in white, and the pil
low was .set together with white braid as
a piping.
Another more elaborate one of Mue
denim was outlined In .-i stnr and crescent
pattern in white. The ends of the pillow
v"er^ rut in points and eyelets worked in
<;-ch point then laced with blue cotton
cord over a strip of white linen, which
was tacked to thr- pillow and could easfh
be removed when soiled.
Common gray toweling with a red stripe
on f-nch side made a cover for a tnird
pillow. At each Bide of the stripe was
worked a row of cat-Rtltching In red
madonna cotton, and on the upper side
of the pillow, aleo in red. the words.
"Sweet be thy dreams." Another one.
similar to the last, was of buff linen
workt-d in brown wash silks.
Odd t'ties in limbreUas
Many curious umbrellas are made. One
seen can be taken apart and put in one's
pocket. The stick is of wood about an
Inch In diameter. The cover can hi
turned inside out and folded into a email
bundle. By touching a spring tbe ribs
come off, straighten out, and may be
placed in the hollow of the stick, which is
then a presentable walking-stick, says the
Woman's Home Companion. It is found
very convenient by its, owner, who is a
drummer.
Another is still more ingenious. The
handle is curved and when a spring is
pressed a pipe files out. The ribs are
stowed away in the center, and the own
er has a walking stick, but in the center
there in also a rapier, which may be
drawn out.
Another neat Invention is a hollow stock
which contains a camp chair. Three steel
supports are pressed out of the top of
the stick, a triangular piece of canvas
put on and a seat Is had which is at
feast as comfortable as a bicycle saddle.
All of these strange umbrellas come from
the old world. ' '
The umbrella-makers say that Euro
peans take much more pride in their um
brellas than do people of this country.
Many little jokes are concealed in . the
umbrella handle there. A handle may
present the appearance of a monkey or
a cat or some other animal, and a secret
spring will cause the little creature to
open its mouth and spurt a drop of co
logne on the beholder. â¢

Th^re are always ways and ways of do-
Ing things hard ways and easy ways.
Tii B '..- an easy way and also a most sat
isfactory one. A broom covered with a
canton flannel bag and a garden hose are
th. principal impl.-mei:ts. The broom
when used uncovered always leaves
streaks and dulls the paint. The canton
flannel bag makes a smooth shiny sur
face. Never leave any water in the de

Knowing how to clean silver is another
thing. Don'l use a silver polish unless the
ware is stained by vinegar or egg. If
properly washed after each m<>al sliver
will never need polishing. To wash sil
ver properly boiling hot water and plenty
of .snap are necessary.
After washing do not rinse. Wipe thor
oughly with a canton flannel cloth and
brighter and cleaner silver could not be
dcs red. Every one knows that silver
should not be washed in the same water
with dishes, n-ir with a greasy cloth, If
this care is taken the weekly silver clean-
Ing day will be done away with. Try it
if it is not labor saving.

"Sarden of Cden" breakfast.
Plain simple vi getables, with plenty of
fruitâ fresh and dried, raw and cookedâ
ar.' finding p pular flavor for hot weather
breakfasts. One wise woman, who claims
that she pins her- faith, both for herself
and daughter, to a "Gardea-of-Bden"
breakfast every morning during the sum-.
mor, : * enthusiastic in its praises. Her
original loea was to eat nothing but
fruit, she says, but she found this diet
Insufficient; so she added a cereal and a
'graham cracker or two to the breakfast
in. .v. This fare, together with lemon
ade, orangeade and fruit juices, gave the
family freedom from warm weather ills
an.l discomforts.
Figs, dates, stewed currants and even
dried apples can be made to do duty for
this purpose, and it is surprising what an
amount of nourishment and working
strength may be extracted from a fruit
diet. Apple*, oranges, shaddocks, bana
nas and canned fruits, of course, are ex
cellent fare for spring and summer, but
the cheaper dried fruits are by no means
to be despised.
In England this regime, with the addi
tion of brown bread and butter or cream,
is followed all the year round with the
children of upper-class families; and the
Scotch choose oatmeal for a similar use.
In many places on the Continent black
bread and 'a piece of watermelon, cucum
ber or onion is the standard breakfast
oftentimes the dinner and Bupper tooâ

MARJORY WATN'TVRTGHT falls !n love with RufUl Colemnn, Sun-lay editor
of thÂ» New Fork Eclipse. She tells her father. onÂ« of the most learned
professors In a great Eastern college, of her intention to marry Coleman and.
In spite of the fact that Coleman was at one time a favorite pupil, the match
la n-.ost bitterly opposed by him. He arranges a trip to Greece hoping to pre
vent the wedding. Ooleman calls on Marjory for an answer to his suit. To
try his affection she treats him coolly and announces her trip to Greece. He
misunderstands, and the result is they say good-by In a most matter Â«f fact
manner, but Marjory rushes In tears to nor father fully convinced that Cole
man doeÂ« not love her. while Coleman goes to the club and drowns his grief
in drink. The professor arrange? tn take son;Â« of his students with his family
to Greeceâ among thÂ«rn a young sophomore named Coke, who has distinguished
himself In a freshman rush and Is regarded by Coleman In the light of a
rival. Coleman gets an appointment as war correspondent of the Eclipse for
the war in Greece and sails via London. On the steamer he meets Nora Black.
a. celebrated danctr and an old friend, who pays him marked attention.

Coleman remained cool. "I've never been decorated for Informing peo
ple of their own affairs," he observed, "but I Bhould nay that you were
about aa much of an artist as I am." . . .
Frowning slightly ehe renected upon this reply. Then of a sudden she
laughed. "There Is no use In being angry with you, Rufus. You always
were a hopeless scamp. But." she added, childishly wistful, "have you
ever seen 'Fly by Night'? Don't you think my dance in the second act is
arti "No!" said Coleman. "I haven't seen 'Fly by Night' yet. but of course

It seemed that her hand tightened on his arm. Her face was radiant.
"There," she exclaimed. "Now you are forgiven. You are a nice boy,
"when Miss Black went to her cabin Coleman strolled into the smoking
room Every man there covertly or openly surveyed him. He dropped
lazily Into a chair at a table where the wine merchant, the Chicago rall
wav king and the New York millionaire were playing cards. They made
a noble pretense of not being aware of him. On the oilcloth top of the
table the cards were snapped down, turn by turn.
Finally the wine merchant, without lifting his head to address a par
ticular person, said. "New conquest."
Hailing a steward Coleman asked for a brandy and soda.
The millianaire said, "He's a sly cuss, anyhow." The railway man

' â¢ ' passenger glanced first at Nora Black and then at him. as if connecting
â¢ them in some train of thought, moved to It by the narrow horizon of snip
â  â¢San.ll.va sense of the mystery that surrounds the lives of the

â "T Tht-v had no been long in the smoking room, however, when the deck
â  : steward cam* with a card to Coleman. T'pon it was written, Come for a

Adieus were falling as dead leaves fall from a great tree. The steward*
were handling small hills of luggage marked with flaming red labels. Tno
ship was firmly against the dock before Miss Black came from her cabin.
Colema.il was at the time gazing shoreward, but his three peculiar friends
instantly nudged him. '"What?" "There she is! 'Oh Miss Black? He
composedly walked toward her. It was impossible to tell whether she saw
him coming or whether it was accident, but at any rate she suddenly
turned and moved toward the. stern of the ship. Ten watchful gossips had
noted ("oilman's travel in her direction and more than half the passenger*
noted his defeat He wheeled casually and returned to his three friends.
They w< re colic-stricken with a coarse and yet silent merriment. Coleman
was' glad that the voyage was over.
After the polite business of an English custom-house the traveler*
passed out to the waiting train. A nimble little theatrical agent of aoms
kind sent from London, dashed forward to receive Miss Black. He had a
first class compartment engaged for her and he bundled her and her maid
into it in an exuberance of enthusiasm and admiration. Coleman passing
moodily along the line of coaches heard Nora's voice hailing him.
"Riifus." There she was, framed in a carriage window, beautiful and
smiling brightly. Every near-by person turned to contemplate this vision.
"Oh," said Coleman. advancing. "I thought I was not going to get a
chance to say good-bv to you." He held out his hand. "Good-by."
She pouted. "Why. there's plenty of room in this compartment." See
ing that BORle forty people were transfixed in observation of her she moved
a short way b;u-k. "Come on in this compartment. Rufus," she said.
"Thanks I prefer to smoke," said Coleman. He went off abruptly.
On the way to London he brooded in his corner on the two divergent
emotions he rind experienced when refusing her Invitation. At Euston
station in London he was directing a porter, who had his luggage, when
he heard Nora speak at his shoulder. "Well. Rufus. you sulky boy," sha
said "I shall be at the Cecil. If you have time, come and see me."
"Thanks, I'm sure, my dear Nora," answered Coleman effusively. "But,
honestly. I'm off for Greece."
A broupham was drawn up near them and the nimble little agent was
waiting The maid was directing the establishment of a mass of luggage
on ar.d in a four-wheeler cab. "Well, put me into my carriage, anyhow,
said Norn. "Yon will have time for that."
Afterward she addressed him from the dark Interior. "Now. Rufus,
you must come to see me the minute you strike London againâ" She hesi
tated a moment, and then smiling gorgeously upon him she said, "Brute!
CHAPTER VIII.
As soon as Coleman had planted his belongings In a hotel he was
bowled in a hansom briskly along the smoky Strand, through a dark city
whose walls dripped like the walls of a cave and whose passages were
only illuminated by flaring yellow and red signs.
\Valkley, the London correspondent of the Eclipse, whirled from his
chair with a shout of joy and relief at sight of Coleman. "Cables," he
cried "Nothln' but cables! All the people in New York are writing cables
tj you. Th ; wires groan with them. And we groan with them, too. They
come In here In bales. However, there is no reason why you should read
them all. Many are similar in words and many more are similar in spirit.
The s<-nse cf the whole thing is that you get to Greece quickly, taking with
yan immen*' sums of money and enormous powers over nations."

"The most astute journalists in Europe have been predicting a general
European smarti-up every year since 1878." said Walkley, "and the proph
ets weep. The English are the only people who can pull off wars on sched
ule time, and they have to do It in odd corners of the globe. I fear the
war business is getting tuckered. There is sorrow In the lodges of the
lone wolves, the war correspondents. However, my boy, don't bury your
face in your blanket. This Greek business looks very promising, very
promising." He then began to proclaim trains and connections. "Dover,
Calais. Paris, Brlnrusi: Corfu, Patras, Athens. That is your game. You
are supposed to skyrocket yourself over that route in the shortest possible
time, but you would gain no time by starting before to-morrow, so you
can cool your heels here In London until then. I wish I was going along."
Coleman returned to his hotel, a knight Impatient and savage at being
kept for a time out of the saddle. He went for a late supper to the grill
room, and as he was seated there alone a party of four or five people came
to occupy the table directly behind him. They talked a great deal even
before they arrayed themselves at the table, and he at once recognized the
voice of Nora Black. She was queening It, apparently, over a little band of
awed masculine worshipers.
Either by Rccident or for some curiouo reason she took a chair back
to back with Coleman's chair. Her sleeve of fragrant stuff almost touched
his shoulder and he felt appealing to him seductively a perfume of orris
root and violet. He was drinking bottled stout with his chop; he sat with
a face of wood.
"Oh, the little Lord?" Nora was crying to some slave. "Now, do you
know, he won't do at all. He Is too awfully charming. He sits and ruml

softly and confidentially. And here she sank back in her chair until <- oh.
man knew from the tingle that her head was but a few Inches from ms
head. Her sleeves touched him. He turned more wooden under the speu
of the orris root and violet. Her courtiers thought it all a . graceful pose^
but Coleman believed otherwise. Her voice sank to the liquid siren note 01

the packet crossing the channel, too, he almost returned to the usual Rufus
Coleman since all the world was seasick and he could not get a cabin in
which to hide himself from it. However, he reaped much consolation by
ordering a bottle of champagne and "drinking it In sight of the people,
which made them still more seasick. From Calais to Brindisi really noth
ing met his disapproval save the speed of the train, the conduct of some
of the passengers, the quality of the food served, the manners of the
guards, the temperature of the carriages, tt*e prices charged and the length
of the journey.
In time he passed as in a vision from wretched Brindisi to charming
Corfu, from Corfu to the little war-bitten city of Patras and from Patras
by rail at the speed of an ox cart to Athens.
With a smile of grim content and surrounded In hia carriage with all
his beautiful brown luggage he swept through the dusty streets of the
Greek capital. Even as the vehicle arrived in a great terraced square in
front of the yellow palace Greek recruits in garments representing many
trades and many characters were. marching up cheering for Greece and the
King. Officers stood upon the little iron chairs In front of thÂ© cafes; all
"Do You Know What Kiod of a Man I Likeâ Really Like?"
the urchins came running and shouting; ladles waved their handkerchiefs
from the balconies; the whole city was vivified with a leaping andjojous
enthusiasm. The Atheniansâ as dragomen or otherwiseâ haupreser\ea an,
ardor for their glorious traditions, and it was as if that in thewhlteausi
which lifted from the plaza and floated across the old ivory face or trie
palace there were the souls of the capable soldiers of the past, eoiernan
was almost intoxicated with it. It seemed to celebrate his own reasons,
his reasons of love and ambition to conquer in love. _ ... ~ . â¢ â
When the carriage arrived in front of the Hotel d'Angleterre Coleman
found the servants of the place with more than one eye upon the scene m
the plaza, but they soon paid heed to the arrival of a gentleman with sucn
an amount of beautiful leather luggage, all marked boldly with the initials
"R. C." Coleman let them lead him and follow him and conduct him ana
use bad English upon him without noting either their words, their salaams
or their work. His mind had quickly fixed upon the fact that here was
the probable headquarters of the Wainwright party, and with the rush or
his Western race fleeting through his veins he felt that he would choke,
and die if he did not loam of the Wainwrights in the first two minutes.
It was a tragic venture to attempt to make the Levantine mind understand
something off the course, that the new arrival's first thought was to estab
lish a knowledge of the whereabouts of some of his friends rather than to
swarm helter-skelter into that part of the hotel for which he was willing
to pay rent. In fact, he failed to thus impress them; failed in dark wrath,
but nevertheless failed. At last he war simply forced to concede the travel
of files of men up the broad, red-carpeted staircase, each man being loaded
with Coleman's luggage. The men in the hotel bureau were then able to
comprehend that the foreign gentleman might have something else on his
mind. They raised their eyebrows languidly when he spoke of the Wain
wright party in gentle surprise that he had not yet learned that they were
gone some time. They were departed on some excursion. Where? Oh,
reallyâ it was almost ' laughable, indeedâ they didn't know. Were they
sure? Why, yesâ it was almost laughable, indeedâ thy were quite sure.
Where could the gentleman find out about them? Well, theyâ they had
explainedâ did not know, butâ it was possibleâ the American Minister might
know. Where was he to be found? Oh. that was very simple. It was well
known that the American Minister had apartments in the hotel. . Was hÂ«
in? Ah, that they could not say.
So â¢ "oilman, reioieiriK at his final emancipation and with, the grime of
travel still upon him, burst in somewhat violently upon the secretary or
the Hon. Thomas M. Gordner of Nebraska, the United States Minister to
Greece. From his desk the secretary arose from behind an accidental bul
wark of books and governmental pamphlets. "Yes, certainly, Mr. Gordner
is in. If you would give me your card â "
Directly Coleman was introduced into another room, where a quiet
man, who was rolling a cigarette, looked him frankly but carefully in thÂ«
eye. 'The Wainwrights?" said the Minister, immediately after the ques
tion. "Why. I myself am immensely concerned about them at present.
I'm afraid they've got themselves into trouble."
"Really?" said Coleman.
"Yes. That little professor is ratherâ stubborn. Isn't he? He wanted
to make an expedition to Nikopolis and I explained to him all the possi
bilities of war and begged him to at least not take his wife and daughter
with him."
" 'Daughter." murmured Coleman, as if in his sleep.
"But that little old man had a head like a etone*and only laughed at
me. Of course those villainous young students were only too delighted at
a prospect of war, but it was a stupid and absurd thing for the man to
take his wife and daughter there. They are up there now. I can't vÂ«t a
word from them or get a word to them." â  â . . 5 â  '
Coleman had been choking. "Where is Nlkopolis?" he asked.
The Minister gazed suddenly in comprehension of the man before bin*
"Nlkopolls Is in Turkey," he answered gently.
Turkey at that time was believed to be a country of delay, corruption,
turbulence and massacre. It meant everything. MorÂ» than a half of thÂ«
Christians of the world shuddered at the name of Turkey. Coleman'*
lips tightened and perhaps blanched, and his chin moved out strangely
once twice, thrice. "How can I get to Nlkopolls?" he said.
The Minister smiled. "It would take you the better part of four days
if you could get there, but as a matter of fact you can't get there at 'he
present time. A Greek army and a Turkish army are looking at each other
from the sides of the river at Artaâ the river is there the frontierâ and
Nikopolis happens to be on the wrong side. You can't reach them. ThÂ«
forces at Arta will fight within three days. I know it. Of course I've noti
fied our legation at Constantinople, but with Turkish methods of communi
cation Nikopolis is about as far from Constantinople as New York Is from
Peking " :j, * r
Coleman arose. "They've run themselves Into a nice mess," he said
crossly. "Well. I'm a thousand times obliged. to you, I'm sure."
The Minister opened his eyes a trifle. "You are ont going to try to reach
them, are you?"
"Yes," answered Coleman. abstractedly, "I'm going to have a try at
It. Friends of mine, you knowâ" â  â¢.^â â¢â i"/
At the bureau of the hotel the correspondent found several cables
awaiting him from the alert office of the New York Eclipse. One of them
read: "State Department gives out bad plight of Wainwright party; lost
somewhere: find them. Ecllnse." When Coleman perused the message ha
began to smile with seraphic bliss. Could fate have ever been less per
verse?
Whereupon lie whirled himself in Athens. And it was to the consider
able astonishment of some Athenians. â¢ He discovered and instantly sub
sidized a young Englishman, who. during his absence at the front, would
net as correspondent for the Eclipse at the capital. He took unto himself
a dragoman and then bought three horses and hired a groom at a speed
that caused a little crowd at the horse dealer's place to come out upon the
pavement and watch this surprising young man ride back toward his hotel.
He had already driven his dragoman into a curious state of oriental be
wilderment and DRnic in which he could only lumber hastily and help
lessly here and there, with his face in the meantime marked with agony.
Coleman's own field equipment had been ordered by cable from New York
to London, but it was necessary to buy much tinned meats, chocolate,
coffee, candles, patent food, brandy, tobaccos, medicines and other things.
He went to br-d that ni*ht feeling more nlaci.l. The train back to
Patras was to start in the early morning, and he felt the satisfaction of a
man v.-ho is at la*t about to start on his own great quest. Before he
dropped of to slumber he heard crowds cheering- exultantly in the streets,
and the cheering moved him a? it had done in the morning. lie felt that
the celebration of tpe people was really an accompaniment to his primal
reason, a reason of love and ambition to conquer in â even as in the
theater the music accompanies the hero in bis progress. He arose once
daring the night to study a. map of the Balkan peninsula and get nailed
into his mind the exact position of Nikopolis. It was important.
CHAPTER IX.
Coleman's dragnmnn aroused him in the blue before dawn. The cor
respondent arrayed himself in one of his new khaki F-uitsâ riding oreeches
and a tunic well-marked with buttoned porketsâ and accompanied b7
â¢â ome of iii~ beautiful "mown luggage, they departed for the station.
The ride to Patrafl is a terror under ordinary circumstances. It be
jrins in the oarlv rnornine and ends in the twilight. To Coleman. having
i vr '. come from Patraa to Athens, this journey from Athenp to r.itras had
all the exnFperatirp elements of a forced recantation. Moreover, he had
rot come prepared to view with awe the ancient city of forinth nor to
view with afimirntion the limpid beauties cf the gulf of that name with its
olive urove shore He was not stirred by Parnassus, a far-awn v snow
f eld hlch on" the black shoulders of the mountains across the pulf. No;
he wished to go to Nlkopolis. He passed over the graves oÂ£ an ancient
race he plfani of whose mlprhty minds shot, hardly dimmed through the
clouding ages. No; he wished to go to Nlkopolis. The train went at a
snail's pace, and if Coleman had an interest it was In the people who Hned
the route and cheered the soldiers on the train. In Coleman's compart
ment there was a greasy person who spoke a little English. He explained
that he was a poet, a poet who now wrote of nothing but war. When a
man is in pursuit of his love and success is known to be at least remote
it often relieves his strain if he is deeply bored from time to time.
The train was really obliged to arrive finally at Patras. even if it was
a tortoise, and when this happened a hotel runner appeared, who lied for
the benefit of the hotel in saying that there was no boat over to Mesa
longhi that night. When, all too late. Coleman discovered the truth of
the matter his wretched dragoman came in for a period of infamy and
suffering. However, while strolling in the plaza at Patras, amid news
boys from every side, by rumor and truth Coleman learned things to his
advantage. A Greek fleet waa bombarding Prevasa, Prevasa was ne:ir
Nikopolis. The opposing armies at Arta were engaged, principally In an
artillery duel. -

Curious Custom of Vassar Girls
In Announcing Their EngagemontS
Vaaear'B recent commencement brought
again to the front a curious old custom
â¢which recurs there each year, and around
â¢which centers the main interest of the
senior class supper, the public announce
ment of engagements by those jsrirls who
have been rash enough to wander Into
love'a young dream during their college
course.
For years the class supper has been se
lected as the fit ar.u proper place for this
proceeding. After the toasts have been
responded to and the songs have been
sung and the hundred and one little
things done which only college girl 3
would think of doing, the class secretary
stands up on her chair and, looking round
on the long row of faces beneath her in
the candle light, announces that she is
going to call the engagement roll.
There are always some girls In the class,
of course, who have made an open secret
of the disposal of their affections and
have worn their rings without reserve.
The whole college knows about them.

by M. de Grouchy, the well-known anti

Maitre Caillet, a Paris notary in 1653, M.
de Grouchy has found an inscription stat
ing that "Maitre Pierre Cadeau does let
and duly devisf to Pierre d'Artagnan
chevalier, brigadier captain and Major
General of the King's army, a house with

amusing to note that D'Artagnan should

General Benjamin F. Tracy is said to have
received for arguing the Molineux tr.al.
and the amount which he is to get every
day that the trial continues.
It is added, by the legal gossips in City
Hall Park, and on the Criminal Court
steps, that General Tracy would not have
taken the case for this small sum were it
not that he wanted to oblige his old
friend General Molineux, whose son
stands in the current of the electrocution
chair.
Benjamin Franklin Tracy, the man wno
can speak to the tune of a dollar a word
and more, began life in a very simple wa.
in a country place-as New Yorkers would
call itâ namely Owego. New York, which
town, though it has produced many great
men still makes few pretensions to great
ness. Wealthy, salubrious, full of possi
bility Owego lies quietly away in the
northern part of New York State, yield
ing its fortunes to those who stick to her
and sending her sons forth with brain*
and gold.
Young Tracy went to the Owego Gram
mar School and then to the Owego
Academy.
At the age of twenty-one he married
Miss Delinda Catlin of Owego and then he
continued his studies, graduating in law
soon after.
Mr. Tracy began his political life at the
age of twenty-three, when he was elected
District Attorney of Owego.
Young Mr. Tracy gained many honors
for himself and at the beginning of the
war he was appointed recruiting officer
for the One Hundred and Ninth and One
Hundred and Thirty-seventh regiments,
with the coloneloy of the former.
He went to the war and served bravely,
here gaining honors again. And at the
close of the war he went to Brooklyn to
Pr ilÂ°ls doubtful if Mr. Tracy was known
generally before the famous Beecher-
Tllton trial, but, being given a chance to
show hi? legal ability, he conducted him
self in the case with such eloquence and
eaee that his fame was, from that time.
It was as a Cabinet officer that Mr.
Tracy changed from a lawyer and a poli
tician to a statesman. In ISS9 Benjamin
Harrison, who had known Mr. Tracy in
the war. and had formed a strong friend
ship lor him afterward, appointed him
Secretary of the Navy; and in the four
following years the name of Tracy was
familiarly before the public.
The saddest casualty of the year oc
curred late in the winter of 1890, when
Secretary Tracy suffered the loss of his
wife and daughter. Awaking one morn
ing at 7 he found the house in flames.
Hurrying, he aroused the family and
rescued the younger members, only to
find when too late that his wife and fa
vorite daughter had perished in the
flames when he supposed them safe in the

Mr. Brunswick attended the same public
schools with Alfred Dreyfus, and his
younger brother, Mathleu, for several
years, and knew both of the boys inti
mately, in the classroom, on the play
gTound and excursions and rambles in the
country around, and has a very lively re
membrance of the lad, who, though some
years his Junior, was well up In the clasÃ
room, as well as a companion and even a
leader among boys somewhat older than
himself.
Though a Jew, as were a number of his
fellows, ' according to Mr. Brunswick,
young Dreyfus always got along well with
his teachers, who were Catholic, and also
with the boys who were not of his own
faith. Indeed, his kindly disposition and
generous bearing toward his companion?
made him exceedingly^ popular, and
though younger than many of them, his
word and Influence were of admitted
weight.
"He was never 'fresh,' " says Mr.
Brunswick, "and thoush his people wore
rich, he mingled and played with the
boys, rich atj'l poor, without making- any
difference. He never <=tood off and looked
on. but took hearty part in everything.
"He was very generous. Whatever he
had he was ready to divide with the oth
the sad sight.
Secretary Tracy never remarried, but
with the remainder of his family went to
live in Brooklyn at the close of the ad
ministration.
There are few men who have lived lives
devoted so singularly to politics who have
so escaped the unpleasantness of the call
ing; but General Tracy seems to have
been free from the criticism that has
ers. If a boy had no marbles to Join In
a game, Dreyfus would readily divide his
stock with him.
"Then he was a good boy, of fine feel-
Ings, not given to vulgar language at all.
as many boys of 12 or 14 years of age

"He never liked to see thÂ© others fight

whenever a quarrel was leading to a
light.
"He was very fond of 'playing soldiers,
and always wanted to be the captain,
and took great delight In the mimic war
fare. He went at It with all his might
and main, though always good humored
about It, even when he got an unusually
hard knock.

"As to the result of the new trial, while
I think a strong fight will be made
against him, yet still I am very sure that
the real facts about him will come out
and that he will be acquitted."
Mr. Brunswick himself served as quar
termaster under Marshal MacMahon dur-

taken prisoner, once at Graveiotte, but
fought his way to liberty, and was

seen, represents an increase in energy

Another noticeable fact ab^ut this
vast work of construction is its dis
tribution, for this illustrates the great
change that has recently occurred in
the shipbu'.kiine industry- At the
organization of the new navy the first
four ships were built by a single firm,
but at the present time no less than
fourteen American concerns are build
ing ships for the navy of this coun-
try-
Of all our new vessels the sheathed
cruiser Albany is alone of foreign
build and this is due to the fact that
she was purchased on the stocks from
Brazil just prior to the breaking out of
the war. At that time it was quite nec
essary that we should have the Ama
zonaa, to prevent Spain from getting
her if for no other reason. Brazil,
however, refused to sell one ship with
out disposing of others at the same
time, and the Navy Department agreed
to the terms.
The Nictheroy was made a part of
the deal and she became the useful
Buffalo, fully worth every dollar of the
5575,000 that was paid for her. The
Amazonas, which had just been com
pleted, cost us $1,429,215. but as the New
Orleans she was of great value, being
the only American warship provided
with smokeless- powder for all batteries.
Her sister ship, the Almirante Abru.
now known as the Albany, was then
nothing more than a few ribs at New
castle-on-Tyne, but we took the con
tract for her construction out of the
hands of the Brazilian Government,
cheerfully paying the $250,000 to boot,
and there is no reason to believe that
the craft, which was recently launched,
â will ever make us regret our bargain.
With these forty-eight vessels and
the dozen or so more that are soon to
be contracted for. the United States
will have become a power upon the
seas instead of being relegated to the
secondary position that she has occu
pied for bo long. With the present
naval programme completed we shall
be close behind Russia, in total dis
placement and fighting efficiency, and
will have jumped ahead of Germany,
notwithstanding the activity in mari
time affairs recently developed by the
Kaiser, who in one year has doubled
the personnel of his service, raisins: the
number of officers and men from 12.000
to 25.000.
When the fact is considered that it
was -but a few years ago that this coun
try was actually inferior to China in
its strength on the seas, the wonderful
progress that we have made can be bet
ter appreciated, and the fact that our
navy is so new means that it is prac
tically quite up to date, and this alone
is a great advantage in time of conflict.
There is no reason, therefore, why we
should not feel encouraged to believe
that with our great- sea-fighting serv
ice of men and ships we would be able
to hold our own with any power In the
.world.

"Whatever of lite hath ebbed away

Into every bare inlet and creek and bayâ"
in a word, when, nature is singing her
gladdest song and all the earth Is astir
with new lifeâ to the front comes the pub
lisher and the book dealer with their lists
oif "summer literature." "books for the
seaside," "selected out-of-.town libraries."
"light reading for campers" and so forth
ad Inf.nitum. Now, what Is summer lit
erature and why is it of necessity differ
ent from autumn literature or winter lit
erature? Summer clothing has its uses
and fulfills the need wo have for bowing
phvslcally to the temperature. Besides,
its" beauty and its f.uflincss and Its gen
eral sT.se of sweet cleanliness recommend
it Summer diet has its reasons. Those
who would "come to old age with an un
impaired digestion and thus enjoy a whole
life of eating" must look to the cooling
salads and fruits of the season, for _ he
who runs himself down at the mouth is
one of the most despised wrecks, and he
gives out most ungracefully." But sum

and bought in quantities by the public,
has about as much . reason as summer
friends and the summer rings of the an

last two Boards of Freeholders of. this

The Catholic church in Ireland is '-ha
church of the poor, and as such is beau
tifully consistent and satisfactory: That
the priests are the best friends that the
poor people have v. as avowed to me by
an intelligent minister of an opposing
denomination, a statement that Is eusily
confirmed by one's own observation. 1* or
the priests are not, as in Italy, mysterious
and unapproachable: they do not consti
tute a -â :â â â  and aristocratic class, which
the poor people must look upon in awe.
They are the brothers and sons of the
humble women, the companions and con
fidants of the young men.
From Dublin to Glendalough and the
sweet vale â¢â ' Avoca. where Moore wrote
"The Meeting of the Waters," an interest
ing little journey, no one v.-ho has ever
visited this delightful corner of the earth
will dispute the words of the poet,
"There's not in this wide world a val
ley so sweet." At New Ross, in Coun
ty Wexford, I obtained the first glimpse
o"f Irish life as I have so often seen it
painted, where the pig and the chicken
are auite as much at home in the boscm
of the family as the many bright-eyed
children. In this town the poverty of the
people and the bleakness of thir lives are
shocking The town is composed of rows
of huts, euphuistically called cottages,
most of them with only one room and one
very small window. The daylight entering
through this single aperture is only suf
city and county. It might have been
aptly and perhaps more comprehensively
christened "An Epitome of the Philos
ophy of Immortality," for this is what
the neatly printed little volume really
contains. Those who expect to find cita
tions of physical or phenomenal evidence
of life eternal between Its covers will be
disappointedâ a fact not to be regretted,
however, by the studious or thoughtful
reader of unprejudiced mind.
This volume (small in size) is one of
the most valuable contributions to mod
ern philosophy that has been published
in the last ten years. Throughout the
author's standpoint has been his own con
ception of what constitutes sound logic
and common sense in relation to this most
momentous of all human problems.. That
this conception is' oft' at variance, with
current beliefs and the popular version
of -scientific conclusions is easily guessed
from -the bare fact thai so widely read
and conscientious an author as Dr.
Anderson should bo convinced that there
was yet to.be said something worth say
ing upon a subject that has been written
about since man learned to form his first
hieroglyphs.
â Although the author assumes neither a
special knowledge nor original ideas,
every observing reader will be impressed
with", the fact that at least the subject
Is not treated in a hackneyed manner nor
ground' traversed' that is already well
worn 'with philosophical ruts. At the
out3et a different interpretation is asked
for to Descartes' famous utterance. It
Is not "I think, therefore 1 exist." â  says
Dr. Anderson, but "I think,, therefore I
am," "thus linking "life with the idea of
eternal being rather than with an out
form, transitory existence. - Neither Des
cartes nor his best interpreters limited
life to thought alone, but. included with
it other phases of consciousness," says
the author. "The original meaning of Des
cartes has thus been quite 'lost sight of
and attention directed wholly to thought
as the sole phenomenon of existence, the
one proof of life. â¢ â¢ â¢ Thought, as
most men conceive of it, is certainly de
stroyed by death, and having been taught
to look upon man as a thinker only, and
upon existence as depending upon
thought, â  men have been driven either
to deny existence after death, as do mod
ern materialists, or to set up a future
life incongruous to . and â¢ ethically dis
connected with that of the' present, as do
modern Christians."
'Not only is thought not the sole proof
of life, says the author, but it Is not the
highest nor the most important faculty of
the soul, and its exaggerated importance
in Western ', philosophy is directly re
sponsible for the confusion and uncer
tainty â¢ with which ' the â  problem of - Im
mortality is still invested. If to live is
merely to think, then there can be no ex
istence after, death. But consciousness
does not depend upon thought, says Dr.
Anderson, and from this point branches
out the real argument of the book, treat
ed under such headings as "Sense Con
sciousness," "Thought and Imagination,"
"Thought, Reason. Intuition, Instinct and
Feeling." "The Effect of Death Upon the
Consciousness of .Life," upon the senses,
the ''desire, consciousness, imagination,
etc.; "The Process of Death," "The Re>
embodiment .of the Soul," and others.

Magazines for August,
The Century.
"Feast Days in Little Italy," the initial
articli' of the August Century, is contrib
uted by Jacob A. Riis. the well-known
writer on social topics. It has a wonder
ful human interest, and although written
from a humorous standpoint it carries an.
undertone of respect for the faith of a
picturesque multitude, even if that faith
be superstition. Pictures by Jay Ham
bldge bring the humorous and pathetic
situations clearly to the eye. John .Bur
roughs, the born naturalist, '.'the lover of
what beautiful things suggest," contrib
utes "Glimpses of Wild Life About My
Cabin." and it is tilled with the beautiful
touches one expects from a man who feels
you must bait your hook with your heart
if you would catch your fish. "In the
Whirl of the Tornado," a personal experi
ence by John R. Mustek, Is followed by a
somewhat scientific discussion of torna
dos in general by Cleveland Abbe, the dis
tinguished American meteorologist. "The
River vi. Tea," by Eliza Scidmorc, carries
us into Oriental lands, and "The People
of the Reindeer," by Jonas Stadling, gives
pictures of the manners and customs of
the Lapps. "Via Crucis," by Marion Craw
ford, is in its nineteenth chapter, and
other fiction is contributed. Other signa
tures are Frank R. Stockton, Major Gen
eral Leonard Wood, John Trowbrldge and
Paul Leicester Ford, the latter writing
most interestingly on "Franklin as Jack
of All Trades."
Scribner's Magazine.
Writers and reavers of short stories look
forward with pleasure to the annual fic
tion number of Scribner's Magazine.
Many "sounding names as on the page of
history" appear in the signatures, but new
writers are also given a chance. The
frontispiece is by \v. Glackens. a young
artist, who gives a French illustrative
handling to home subjects and makes
"The Play's the Thing" a doubly Interest
ing story. Maxfield Parrish has done the
cover. "The Trail of the Sandhill Tag"
is contributed by Ernest Seton Thompson,
whose "Wild Animals I Have Known"
gave such a new color to animal life.
"Little Italy" again comes to the front

Jacob Rlls, so active In charitable

The Overlcod Monthly.
A magazine with well cut, even edges
may not lean a way over toward the nine

discusses "Augustin Daly and His Life
Work"; Mrs. John King Van Rensselaer
in an illustrated article speaks of "The
Basis of New York Society," and traces
the present conditions back to their
source and through their various evolu

This Is a timely little pamphlet, a re

The author, Frank Holme of the Chicago

business is not rushing. The . Irishman m
well as his wife is so extremely loquacious
that 1 am afraid he wastes a great deal
of valuable time in talking to his neigh

very amusing to see the old women with

Blarney Castle, with the famous blarney
stone, is about an hour from Cork. Lest
you should already have looked at the pic
ture 1 shall state at once that I did not
kiss it. The reason is perhaps obvious.
"Do ladies ever try to kiss it?' I asked
the old woman who has guarded the
castle for thirty-five years. "Shurc,
ma'am, the ginteelest way for a lady to
kiss it," she answered glibly, " is to let
a gintleman kiss it and then to kiss the
gintleman. It's the most agraable way as
1 kin suggest."
Even the "gintlemen" are not so brave
as might be expected when it comes to
kissing the blarney stone, for the feat is a
most dangerous one, and is very rarely
performed except by sailors or profes
sional acrobats. The old castle is beauti
ful and romantic, and does not need the
blarney stone to make it worth the trip.
From Cork by rail to Macroom, and
from there coaching to Glengariff is my
most cherished recollection of Ireland.
The route has not been spoiled by 'inva
sions of tourist hordes, and the people are
yet themselves simple and delightful. We
stopped a while at the little village of
Inchigella. and from there through
mountains and past lakes to the savage
grandeur of Gaugane Barra.
A scene of more utter loneliness or
sterner magnificence than Gaugane Barra
it would be impossible- to conceive. It is
only relieved by a little island with a
group of graceful ash trees and an old
ruined chapel. Down from the surround
ing mountains rush numerous streams,
tributaries to the lake, that collects and
sends them forth in the beautiful river
Lee to form the harbor of Cork. Surround
ed on all sides by hills, the traveler feels
imprisoned as though it would require the
wings of an eagle to escape. The small
island is nearly midway in the lake, a
rude artificial causeway leading to it from
the mainland This is the famous hermit
age of St. Fin Bar. who is said to have
lived here wevioas to tils rounding ma
Cathedral of Cork. It is classed among
the holiest places in Ireland, and has long
been a favorite resort of the faithful, who
believe that Its consecrated waters have
power to heal all kinds of diseases, mak
ing the blind to see, the lame to walk, the
deaf to hear.
At certain seasons immense crowds as
semble here, bringing their sick children
and ailing animals to bathe in the sacred
waters Upon, the bushes and neighbor
ing crosses hang fragments of clothes
and halters, proving that for the various
animals, biped and quadruped, the lake
has performed the anticipated miracles.
The sacred character of uaugane Barra
has, it is said, preserved it from the pest
of so many Irish lakesâ the enchanted
eel. Legend has it that in other lake dis
tricts this monster often makes his ap
pearance at njght and gobbles up the
cows and other stray possessions of the
inhabitants. In ancient times the blessed
Isle of Saint Fin Bar was also subject to
visits of this enemy, but on one occasion,
having snatched the loneen, or holy wa
ter vessel, from the hand of the officiat
ing priest, he was expelled forever from
the neighborhood.
To leave Gaugane Barra it Is necessary
to go through the celebrated pass of
Keim-an-eigh, or Deer Pass, which la
utterly desolate and gloomy. A moun
tain has been divided by some convulsion,
of nature and the narrow pass, about two
miles in length, is overhung on either
side. At every step some huge rock juts
into the path. Nowhere has nature as
sumed a more appalling aspect or mani
fested a more stern resolve to dwell in
her own loneliness and grandeur, undis
turbed by any living thing, for even the
birds shun a solitude so awful, and the
hum of the bee or the chirp of the grass
hopper is never heard within its pre
cincts. Protected by these fortresses of
rocks, ages ago the outlawed O'Sullivans
and O"Learys kept their freedom and
laughed to scorn the sword and fetter of
thf> Saxon, occasionally descending and
raiding the neighboring flocks and herds.
As may be expected in modern times,
these rocky fortresses have given shelter
to bands of lawless men, to smugglers
and highway robbers. During the dis
turbances of 1822 the Pass of Keim-an
eigh was a great stronghold of the
rebels.
But it would be easy to write a book
of legend and story and romance that
one gathers in even a little trip in Ireland.
Every lake and every river has its story,
which the moat intelligent Irishman halt
believe? in spite of himself. Glengariff
and KilUirney are the most fashionable
places in Ireland. They are both very
beautiful, but of course the romance .s
spoiled by the presence of the up-to-date
girl who stares at you through a lorg
nette and the chappie radiant in summer
resort costume. It is the fashion to rave
about the lakes and rilis of Killarney,
so I shall refrain.
Ireland as a country I am afraid is
dead â "gone up the Hume," as the back
woodsman would say. To a Catholic
priest whom I heard lamenting the situ
ation I put the question, "What can ba
done about it; what is the possible rem
edy?"
"Ah," he said, shaking his head sadly,
"there is no remedy. Even the landlords
are poor. In oppressing the tenants they
have killed the goose that laid the golden
egg. I-ast year 15,000 marriagable girls
emigrated; this year there will be more.
What can you expect when the youth of
a country deserts it In that fashion?"
There was something of reproach in his
tones against these deserters, and yet h%
acknowledged that these same emigrants
made It possible for the old people to
live. There are hundreds of them, ha
told me, entirely dependant on what they
receive from America.
Dr. Johnson one day said to Boswell

A word of warning to those of my read
ers who were particularly interested in
the Beauty Talk on the subject of white
hair that appeared a few Sundays since.
In It I suggested putting a few drops of
bluing in the water in which white hair is
rinsed. I did not mean the liquid bluing,
such as comes in bottles already pre
pared. Results dire and disastrous would
likely follow its use. Gat the little balls
of bluing and make thÂ« liquid yourself. A
few drops of this In thÂ© water will give to
white hair that pretty, silvery look that
is so much a'lmirfid.

A. B. Câ l know of nothing more diffi

spots that come near the eyes. The best
treatment of which I know is a diet of
lemons and oranges, with constant appli

of borax haÂ» been dissolved. What will
bring back the color to the cheeks? Good
health, which can be got by proper foods,
scrupulous cleanliness, regular exercise,
sweet temper and early hours. That
sounds easy, doesn't it? If all of us had
will and determination enough to carry
out thfÂ«e few simple rules the makers of
rouges would go out of business in short
order. Very fine hair should not be
washed oftener than once a month, and
then should be treated with great care
and gentleness, as it is likely to tangle
and so become broken. A dessertspoonful
of ammonia and a pinoh of borax in the
wntpr when you wash your hair will give
it that fluffy appearance. A great many
people claim that the curling Iron will
not injure the hair unless the Iron Is too
hot and burns off the little tendrils. But

would banish the Iron. Put your curls up
on soft tissue-paper at night Instead. All
those little, tiny hairs about your fore
head can be coaxed into a luxurious
growth by clipping occasionally massag

gestion of olive oil to nourish the roots.

Your life will be long, but not very easy.
The main thing that threatens you is

You will never be very wealthy, but you

rather jealous, impatient, and you should
be very' careful of your tongue. You will,
however, always get along with people.
MISS F. R. 8.. Fifteenth street, City-
It Is a good thing that you are careful, as
you are somewhat liable to accidents and
dangers. You will lose some of the money
you now possess, but your inventive mind

The only thing you have to dread is the
loss Of property. Don't let this occur, for
you can prevent it.
SAND FOSS. Cityâ You possess intens

your struggles and ambition. Be more
moderate and in the long run you will
find that you are more successful. You
have a splendid heart line, but you are bo
changeable and dilatory that you mar
even the best of intentions. You are fond
of change, are very visionary and make
acquaintances quickly and forget them
as easily. You are very fond of amuse
ment and pleasure and fortunately you
have both wealth and health.
PATRICA, X.. Cityâ You have a bril

ARTIE Z., San Jogeâ You will never

of much in the way Of friendship and ben
efits. You have good reasoning power and
you should use it. You have the hand of
a bachelor, but are of an ardent nature
and will marry a widow. There are a
number of entanglements before you. In
business you are very broad-minded.
BERTELLE 8., San Joseâ You possess
a spirituelle hand, and there is much of

nervous, sensitive and artistic, and
you are beloved by all. You are very con
scientious and reliable. Your life will be
remarkable, as your planetary influences
are aubl'me. You will have lots to throw
away and you won't miss it. Your love
of pets is strong. You are passionately
fond of flowers and birds and you will al
ways possess a happy home.
MRS. R. M., Fifteenth street, Cityâ
You will combat fate and will havo a
great deal to resist. Your disposition is
lovely, but through mismanagement you
will have some little trouble. You are
very moody and observing. ' In the future
you will have better health.
MISS M. E., San Joseâ You are of a deli

MR G B.â You like money too well and

MR. C. T. A., Petalumaâ You will have
many changes throughout your life. You
have had losses, but your future will be
more settled. \ou are not lucky in specu

money matters. Your life has been threat
ened, and you do not make many friends.
You have Individuality and are quick of

for you, but you will never be very
wealthy. You would make a good writer,
as you have an imaginative mind. You
are naturally a philanthropist, a lover of
nature, and are very artistic. A long
journey is before you.
KVANGELINE A.. Eurekaâ Be more
firm of purpose. You will have a long life,
which will be full of events, and you will
be lucky on water. You are charitably

disposition. Your greatest desire at the
present time is to go away from home.
You are fond of music and society and
of the world in general. Be careful or
you will make many mistakes.
MRS. A. E. P. E., Fort Braggâ You

door to hell itself. There are hundreds
of legends and stories among the Pimas,
Marl : Oocopahs about the hor
rible bdr.^s that have in aÂ«es past come
from among the volcanoes to the Injury
of the Indians and of the spirits of dead
and wicked red men that wander about
down there in the sulphurous atmosphere,
only waiting an opportunity to wreak
vengeance upon some unsuspecting sav
age. The Jesuit missionaries who came
up the Rio Grande in 1798 on a mission
of Christianity and civilization among the
savages were probably the first whites
â¢who saw the volcanoes in that region.
Their diaries contain several pages of
tht grewsome legends the Indians con
nected with the "land of the always
mad epirit."
The air for miles around the valley of
the volcanoes is heavy with foul fumes,
and only persons of strong lungs and
throats can stand the odors, even several
miles away, for more than a few hours.
When one has gone to the volcanoes the
odors are found to be dangerous to ani
mal life unless there Is a strong breeze
blowing to carry the sulphur-laden air
away. There are undoubted stories of
â  persons who have ventured too far among
the volcanoes, where the air was calm and
heavy with the poison, who have died
In a few minutes. Several years ago Pro
fessor Smedley of Ontario College fitted
up an apparatus whereby he could carry
a rubber bag full of pure air while he was
exploring among tht liveliest of these vol
canoes. In some way his device did not
work when he had gone only 290 yards
Into the valley of the "fire spitters," as
the Indians call them, and had he not been
seen to stagger and fall by several com
panions who, at the risk of their own
lives, rushed in to his rescue, he would
have died in a few minutes. As it was,
the whole party was 111 for a week or
more from the effects of inhaling the poi
son.
The first view of the locality of the vol
canoes from an elevated spot on a hill on
the edge of the valley is memorable. ThÂ«
feeling as one gazes oi'er an area of
thirty miles under the hot, burning sun
of the desert, dotted everywhere by thou
sands of hummocks and mounds, and blue
â moke curling up from some of these, and
flames and particles of molten lava from
others, Is that here Indeed is a literal In
ferno on earth. The mounds or volcanoes
are of all sizes, from that of a hogshead
to a mound some 160 to 200 feet high. The
majority of them are about fifteen feet
high, and are sixty feet In circumference
at the greatest point. Most of these lit
tle volcanoes are active, and when they
Â«xÂ« not apitticAT taxth. vaoor and lurid
flames are boiling and stewing within. The
of. several thousand volcanoes,
::;p. grumbling and bubbling, Is In
describable. The ground trembles beneath
feet, and a peculiar purple haze en
a the seen' aa far as one can see.
On some days a few of the larger volca
noes those that are 100 feet hiarh and
slightly less than an acre In areaâ may
be In eruption. Then the scene is even
more impressive. The rumbling is so loud
that one must almost shout to be heard
by bystanders. A dozen times a minute
a flame twenty-live feet high and about
ei^ht feet In diameter bursts from the
crater of each of the larger volcanoes,
and is accompanied by a sound like the
escape of steam from an enormous safety
valve on a steam engine. The flame is of
a peculiar dark reddish hue, and when
hundreds of hits of lava the size of cab
bages are thrown with it the noise is
louder. The flame settles back within the
volcano as rjuickly as it shoots out, only
to burst forth again in four or five sec
onds. Sometimes the large volcanoes are
active for a fortnight at a time, and then
may rest for a year. A few days is tho
usual period of eruption with these, and
the periods may be months apart.
The valley of volcanoes may be reached
only by a boat from Yuma down the Col
orado River. The journey can be made
only at a certain season in the year, and
then it is hazardous. The danger lies In
the treacherous eddies an<3 rapids of the
Colorado. There are but few reliable In
dian pilots on the river, and none of them
can be Induced to go within miles of the
valley, which they know as "Bad Man's
Hunting Ground." The route la uncertain,
owing to the unaccountable freak the
stream has of suddenly drying up when
it is Irast expected. The best time Is In
May or the latter part of April, because
later in the season It g-ets too hot down
THE LATE ROBERT BONNER AND HIS HORSES.
IN all his long business career In this
country the late Robert Bonner was
recognized as a man of versatile ge
nius, but in not one of the many
things he did, and did so well, did he
nil so much of the public eye and be
come universally known as when he took
up the role of horseman.
This happened forty years ago, when In
ISSS his health began to suffer from the
continued strain of overwork.
"You must take some outdoor exercise,
some daily relaxation," said his doctor.
"Can you drive horses, do you know any
thing about horses?"
"No," replied Mr. Bonner, "I do not,
that is to say, I know very little, but if
you think a daily drive behind a pair of
good trotters up the road will be bene
ficial I will soon learn all that is needed."
And with the intense earnestness char
acteristic of the man he kept his word as
to learning the part, and soon became not
only one of the most expert but one of
the most unique and picturesque figures
among the horsemen of America.
Mr. Bonner was a Presbyterian of the
old school and a pillar of the church, but
he from the first developed a keen love for
the trotter, and in an Interview about
twelve months ago, In which he defended
his large expenditures in trotting stock,
amounting to more than $600,000, he stated
that his contributions to the church far
exceeded that figure. He was a strong
personal friend of Dr. John Hall and
Henry Ward Beecher, and spent hours In
conversation with them, but the following
day found him equally at home and fully
as enthusiastic discussing pedigrees and
Vhv?re. If the prospective traveler toe a
good boatman he might be safe In at
tempting the trip by the Colorado down to
the point where it meets the Incoming
stream, which thus early In the year It
always dry. His craft he can safely leave
moored to the banks of the Colorado, for
in this country there are no roving band*
of Indians or predatory boatmen to steal
it. There are probably not fifty human
beings in that whole region of the mouth
of the Colorado from one decade to an
other. The Journey across the Interven
ing thirty miles of desert and mountain
can easily be made by following the dry
bed of the little river, which will bring
one directly to the edge of the basin
wherein lies one of the greatest natural
wonders of the continent. It Is perhaps
unnecessary to say that a supply of food
and water must be taken.
The valley of the volcanoes Is about
thirty-two miles long and from fifteen to
twenty miles wide. It has been found
by surveys to be about one-third of a
mile north of the line dividing the United
States and Mexico, and engineers have
ascertained the territory is about 300 feet
below the level of the sea. To the north,
towering skyward, their snow-covered
tops glistening in the sunlight, are the
lofty Cocopah Mountains, and to the far
west, just within range of the vision, can
be discerned the Coast Range. To the
south are also seen rugged crests of an

Splan or Doble.
He seemed to have an equal facility dis
cussing a point of theology dogma as he
had in describing the anatomy of the
horse's foot, of which he had made an
especial study. A regular attendant at
church. Mr. Bonner was at the same time
a keen follower of the trotting turf, tak
ing a deep Interest In all the races he
â witnessed, especially when the finishes
were close; and with him it was always
in regard to heat or Face winners, "How
are they bred?"
Though he owned at times all of the
past kings and queens of the trotting
turf, he had conscientious scruples
against racing them. At most they only
appeared at rare intervals for exhibi
tion purposes, without ft* or reward of
any kind.
From a horseman's standpoint, however,
Mr, Bonner stood forth prominently as
the pioneer of amateur road driving as
a healthful recreation. Long before the
days of Commodore Vanderbilt and the
sealskin brigade, and years before the
civil war, Mr. Bonner was driving his
first pair, Lantern and Light, up Third
avenue, then a plain road, Innocent of ele
vated railroads and unshackled of the
cable lines.
He believed and lived tip to the belief
that the best horse that blood and train
ing could produce for the trotting track
was not too good for a gentleman to drlva
on the road. His theory was that If a
horse that could trot in three minutes was
desirable, then a 2:30 horse was even more
THE SUNDAY CALL.
other chain of mountains, not so lofty a*
the Cocopahs, but more broken. Not a
bit of vegetation may be seen for over
a hundred miles around. The very moun
tains look blasted and spectral. To the
east is still another ragged ribbon of
rocks jutting out sharply against the
horizon. In this rock-hemmed basin are
active and dead volcanoes, spouting gey
sers, boiling springs, a lake of some black,
sticky substance resembling Ink, craters
that blow out only dry ashes, others that
send forth stones and gravel, and still
others that belch liquid and blazing
streams of mud. There are other holes
which emit only lazy puffs of smoke or
steam, while from all Issues a pungent
so, and It was this Idea, carried to its
logical conclusion, that Induced Mr. Bon
ner to successively buy the champion
kings and queens of the harness turf.
For three or four years previous to his
purchase of Dexter Mr. Bonner took his
dally spin behind Flatbush Mala and Lady
Palmer, two mares that he had made a
splendid road team of by sympathetic
treatment and studying their peculiarities.
This bond of sympathy between Mr. Bon
ner and. every horse that he orove was a
notable feature. Even Dexter, the in
tractable, the horse that was going to run
awny and kick everything to smithereens
and bo on, was subdued by It.
It was in 1567 when Dexter was pur
chased for $36,000. The gelding had been
in Budd Doble's charge. Doble, when he
heard of the sale, said:
"I'll have him back again In three
weeks. Mr. Bonner can't dnr* that horse
on the road."
But Mr. Bonner did drive Dexter, and
made a most pleasant roao horse of him.
Six weeks after Doble's remark be went
to Mr. Bonner and asked to borrow the
bridle with which tha latter was driving
Dexter every fine afternoon in central
Park. Said Mr. Bonner:
â >Tou can see the bridle, Mr. Dobie, and
have It If you wish; but It la not the bridle
or bit; It's what la behind all thatâ*, feel
ing of sympathy between tnÂ« horse and
the man."
Some time later. In 1*69, after Dexter
had lowered the trotting record to 2:17%,
Mr. Bonner offered $100,000 for any trotter
that could equal or surpass that time. The
offer was made on October 14, arid held
cdor of brimstone. Stranrely In contrast
with this area of fire and destruction there
are numerous springs of clear, sparkling
cold water, exquisitely grateful to the pal
ate parched by the heat and the sulphur
ous fumes. What is more peculiar Is that
the Springs of cold water are often found
In proximity to the hot springs and
separated from them only by a few yards.
This Is a land that has never been trav
ersed. Human beings have tried It, but
they never return to tell of their experi
ences or of their discoveries. Little heaps
of bleaching bones can be seen scattered
about here and there over the lava-strewn
surface of the ground. Bones of animals
also lie about, telling tha story of the
fatal wanderings of animals. It Is a dan
good until the end of the trotting season,
but no challenger appeared.
A year or two ago. In his last published
Interview on his reminiscences of the
trotters, Budd Doble said that it was his
firm belief that had Dexter had the ad
vantages of the bicycle sulky and the
modern Improved tracks he could have
come very close to the best record of
to-day.
Every one who knew Mr. Bonnw knew
what a stickler he was for the fact that
the 2:0S a 4 made by Maud S was the cham
pion record. It was made to an old fash
ioned high wheeled Bulky, and though of
late years many horses with faster rec
ords than Maud S have tried to beat it
to a pair of high wheels, all have failed.
Mr. Bonner rarely bought a horse at a
public sale, thcugh, strangely enough, the
last purchase he made was from & sale
at Madison Square Garden. This was
when he bought Praytell, by JLxtell, for
$5100.
Mr. Bonner made a profound study of
the anatomy of the horse's foot, and
many is the mixed, rough galted one that
he has converted into a straight going,
pure gaited trotter.

up as from a â  catapult, or a shower of

overtake the unwary traveler and for
ever stop his progress. But these are not
the greatest dangers, for Invariably any
upheaval or violent convulsion of these
forces of nature la heralded by a sullen
roar and rumbling noises that shake the
earth and give one ample warning to get
away. The greatest danger is from the
suffocating clouds of deadly fumes that
perpetually hang over this region and

overwhelm the traveler, or which some
sudden gust of wind may drive down with
the same fatal results. For this reason it

Nothing haa yet been definitely decided
as to the Bonner stock farm at Tarry
town, N. V., the home of Ansel, Startle
and other stallions and some thjrty-flve
or forty mares. The recent death of A.
A. Bonner removed the only one of Mr.
Bonner's sons of pronounced sentiments

sons are skilled reinsmen, friends who
speak with some little authority think it
Improbable that the Tarrytown farm,
founded some quarter of a century since,
will be continued.
the canyons of the mountains that wall
this valley of desolation. There, too, Is
the curious "self-rising earth." As far
as the eye can see it appears in curving
outline, up and down, as if puffed up by
a natural yeast. The unfortunate crea
ture who steps upon the little hills will
crash through, for they are not much
more than fragile crusts. Beneath is a
Bwamp of thin, slimy, salt mud of un
measurable depth. Still stranger is that
section of the valley which, for want of
a better name, is called "salt earth." In
numerable pinnacles, tapering to points
as fine as needles and over a foot long,
rise in close array from the ground.
These are as hard as stone and as dan
gerous as sharpened steel.
This land is a desolate waste of Inan
imate mineral objects. The volcanoes
have symmetrical, sloping sides, and each
has the same distinguishing characteris
tic â a crater. Some are dead, their flrea
having been extinct for ages, and many
of these are nearly filled with ashes or
solid masses of lava which have cooled.
One of these extinct craters, near the
edge of the basin, is on a mound whose
apex is about twenty feet above the sur
rounding level. This mound is one of the
largest In the region, and its base covers
two or more acres. The crater is fully
seventy feet across and la filled with
water so clear that one can see the sides
of the crater for many feet below the
surface; but farther out this little ele
vated lake Is practically bottomless. A
line with a sinker attached fell 300 feet
and did not touch the bottom. One never
sees a bird there. Xot even a bug has
been known to venture Into this valley
of death. As for trees or vegetation of
any kind, there Is none. Even the cactus,
that friend of the desert, cannot find root
here. At the springs of cold water not
a blade of grass or a tuft of moss find*
life.
A very Interesting object In this land
is a huge volcano that Is on the outskirts
of the valley proper, and therefore easy
to study. It is fifty feet high and haa a
circumference of BtX) feet at the base. It
Â»3 an active volcano and la the largest
elevation in sight, though there may be
bigger ones farther in the Interior never
discovered by man; but a circuit made
entirely around the edges of the basin
has failed to find its equal in size or any
thing even approaching it. It ia an ac
commodating monster. It has regular pe
riods of unrest, and whenever it warns
to apit fire or vomit rocks and molten
mud it gives notice of its intentions by
peculiar roar before which all other
lounds become stilled. It groans as if
With a mighty pain, and If one should
thance to be standing on the edge of the
crater and preserve his balance lonjf
â¢nough to take a good look inside hÂ«
tvould see masses of molten matter far
down begin to heave and boil and aurge
up and down with convulsive moves.
That ia an opportune moment to de
part. In a quarter of an hour the bub
bling, seething, rumbling caldron within
has risen to the level of the crater and
its streaming red-hot contents are pour
ing over the sides, while with an increas
ed thunder and splurging noise llttla col
umns of lava spout up into the air and
lumps of mud and stones are thrown oat
and shot far away. These convulsions
last only a few minutes, and then tha
old fellow takes a rest for a period vary
ing from thirty-six to seventy-two houra.
It takes twenty-four hours, however, for
the ejected matter to cool sufficiently to
permit one to approach the crater. What
this volcano does is repeated on a small
er scale by all the other active volcanoes,
and as they are countless in number, it
follows that the din of eruption ia con
tinuous and well-nigh deafening. The air
is always murky with smoke and steam,
and cinders and particles of dirt and
ashes drop so Incessantly that one is cov
ered with dark yellow dust in a very few
moments.
Perhaps the greatest curiosity in thl3
uncanny land by the Colorado River Is
what the naturalists In California call
a lake of ink. Scientific journals have dis
cussed time and again what this lake of
ink really is. It is a great pool of a black
writing ink, more than anything else. It
is situated about half a mile from tha
large volcano just described, and lies flush
with the ground. It is about an aert in
area. The surface of the lake is coated
with gray ashes from the volcanoes to the
thickness of about half a foot, and the
explorer in those parts who is not look
ing out for this freak of nature would
he very apt to walk into it. The Indiana
have a score of horrible .legends about
bad red men who have gone down to
frightful deaths beneath the ashes. Sur
veyors have found that the lake is some
300 yards deep in some places, and no bot
tom can be found in others. There is
nothing but theory as to the source of
the supply for the lake, but no one seems
to kn-jw the component parts of the acre
of black fluid. The Indians say it is com
posed of the blood of bad Indians, who are
Buffering in their hrll amid the volcanoes.
Samples of the lake have been brought
to luma and Los Angeles for tests and
examination. It has been found good for
common marking purposes. Cotton goods
that have been soaked with the strange
black fluid keep their color for months,
even when exposed to the sun, and tha
goods have a stiffness that is somewhat
like weak starch. A gallon of the lake fluid
was sent to the Smithsonian Institution at
Washington the other day for analysis.
There is a lake of a somewhat similar
fluid in Nicaragua, and it is close beside
a group of ancient volcanoes. The black
fluid of Nicaragua is a deadly poison. It
has never been satisfactorily analyzed.Here Is the Most Stunnig Woman of Our Local
