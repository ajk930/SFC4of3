CLEARING BROOKLYN STREET OF STRIKERS.
NEW YORK, July 17.â strike
situation in Brooklyn to-night re
mains unchanged. The striking j
employes are even more deter- j
mined than they were yesterday
and the management -of the Rapid
Transit lines is obdurate and. unflinch
ing.
Cars were run on most of the lines
governed by the Traction Company"
from early morning until 7 o'clock this
evening, but after sundown there was
considerable falling off in the service
and by 9 o'clock not a car was moving
on any of the lines affected by the
striking motormen or conductors. The
roads, comprising the Nassau line were
most effectively crippled. None of the
striking employes returned to work and
most of them were busy during the day
influencing union and non-union men
on the other lines to quit work. In this
respect the strikers were partially suc
cessful, but they made no inroads on
the running of the Putnam-avenue
cars. This line is practically intact,
not more than half a dozen of its em
ployes "being affiliated with the strikers.
The Coney Island Railroad Company
reaped a rich harvest on all of its lines
during the day. The Franklin avenue.
Smith and Jay streets, Hamilton ave
nue and De Kalb avenue lines were
running on full time and carried a
great many passengers through the
day and night.
The Coney Island Company lived up
to its agreement with the employes and
consequently its business was not in
terfered with in the slightest. In fact,
the business of these roads was consid
erably augmented, as many travelers
patronized the cars, although in many
cases going blocks out of their way to
do so.
Of all the lines in the traction system
the Flatbush avenue and a newly
opened Brighton Beach route were the
most seriously affected during the day.
The regular schedule on the Flatbush
and Brighton Beach . roads calls for
ninety-four cars, but only six of these
were successfully worked. On the Nos
trand-avenue line, which runs from
the Twenty-third street ferry landing
in Williamsburg to Flatbush avenue
and Bergen Beach, seventy-five cars
are daily sent out. To-day only eight
were manipulated and most of these
did not cover the entire route. Tomp
kins avenue was very much neglected,
only two cars passing over the entire
lines during the day.
There was a. riotous demonstration
by the strikers and their sympathizers
at Flatbush late.this afternoon, when
President Rossiter of the Rapid Transit
Company addressed a meeting of the
men who had gone out on the Flatbush
and Nostrand avenue lines. President
Rossiter drove to the hall in a carriage
in company with Seth L*. Keeney. a di
rector of the road, and another official.
There was a crowd of more than -'odO
people around the hall when he arrived,
and he was received with shouts hiss>e3
and jeers.
He was met by a committee of flve
men, representing the strikers, and
they had a conference of twenty min
utes before he was permitted to vpeak.
When he finally went upon the platform
the hall was crowded to suffocation
with the strikers and the men who were
aiding them.
Mr. Rossiter was introduced by Al
bert Sweeney, the chairman. The lat
ter said as he came forward: "This is
Mr. Rossiter. Win or lose, let us be
gentlemen."
There were shouts, jeers and hisses as
the president of the road stepped for
ward.
"I want to say," he began, "that I

don't need an Introduction to the men.
' They have seen me in the powerhouses !
and along the lines and in the barns
and they know -me." ..___ ..: : y.y"'"'.â^'^.^
He was again interrupted . with I
shouts, jeers and cries. "We want an |
agreement. Sign an agreement," could
be heard in the din.
"That's a lie," was shouted again.
The president told of the beginning of
| the strike and the measures he had
| taken. "Yesterday all the cars wlnt al
i most on schedule time," he said.
"That's a lie," was shouted out, and
. again there was hissing. . . , . â¢
"I don't need to ask you to believe It,"
j he continued. "You know whether it is
j true or not. To-day the cars on all the
j lines are running on nearly the regular .
! schedule." b , !
He endeavored to talk, but scarcely
-1 uttered a sentence without being jeered
j and hissed, and finally as he told of his
j dealings with the men and his. desire to
j aid them, but of his determination not
! to recognize there was a strike. -there
t was a din that lasted for fully a quarter
of an hour. > .
After it was over the president said
he had come to the meeting to restore
t harmony. He declared he would take
the men back and not hold their action
against them. He gave them until 6
o'clock to return,' and said if they did
not come back to. work then they would
be discharged. .
"We'll never come back." was the
reply, in a shout from " the house.
"Drag him down! Kill him!" The
speaker smiled while the babble reigned
and finally he was escorted downstairs
and through a mob outside that shouted
for his life. He entered a carriage with
his party and was . driven to i barns
around the corner, where â¢ the party
boarded the car Ampere.
The crowd made a rush for the car,
but was driven off. Then, with ' Mr.
Rossiter on the front platform, the cool
est man about, the car went to Church
street in Flatbush and was switched off
; toward the Thirty-ninth street ferry. ... â¢
Early in the afternoon small-sized
\ bowlders and stumps of trees were
thrown upon the Flatbush-avenue
; tracks in front of the . Midwood Club,
i but all these obstructions Were removed
| in time to allow the limited number of
cars to make their scheduled trips. Con
siderable difficulty was experienced on
the x*> strand-avenue and crosstown
lines, but no .serious mishap occurred.
All the cars were manned ' by two ,or
more policemen, and the presence of
the officers aboard the cars prevented
in a great measure any â¢ outbreak on
the part of the strikers or their sym
pathizers. 'â ''' ' :'-'yf ly'^-.cf
Very few cars were run over the old
Nassau lines, and those which were run
were in charge of road inspectors, elec
tricians and trackmen belonging* to the
road. These cars Were totally'inade
quate to supply transportation for their
patrons, and those who rode over the
lines had to put up with frequent and
annoying delays. - ? b ' y-'f'f
At 7 o'clock this evening President
Rossiter issued Instructions to shut
down all the traction company's lines,
and from that time until long after
midnight not a car was run, with the
exception of a couple which were placed
at the service of the city authorities to
take the policemen to outlying districts,
and thousands of . citizens were com
pelled to walk home.
Chief' of Police Devery spent the
greater part of the afternoon in Brook

New York policemen, who had been on
duty since early yesterday, six hours'
leave of absence, and in the meantime

SITUATION NOT "WELL IN HAND"
HONGKONG, July. 17.â After a long struggle against an unfair censorship of the press
the, American correspondents in Manila have decided to make a public statement from
Hongkong, which they were not permitted to make from Manila. This statement has
been cabled by the Associated Press correspondent for publication in all the papers in the
United States. It was submitted to General Otis and discussed at two conferences lasting
three hours each. Although promising to mitigate the rigors of censorship he refused abso
lutely to let the statement go from Manila. Therefore we are obliged to send it from Hong
kong. * WILL DINWIDDIE.

MANILA. July 11 (via Hong
; kong, July 17).â The constant
ly increasing strictness of the
â¢ censorship of press dispatches
from. Manila, which has pre
vented, the cabling to the United; States
of anything that did 'not reflect" official
views of important events f- and . condi
tions, resulted in a united effort on the
part .of- the correspondents here to se
cure" l an abatement of the rigor of the
censorship. The initiative, in this direc
tion was takfen a month ago, and re
sulted-in the- framing, of a statement
.which ['â was; presented on Sunday. July
9, to Major General Otis, commanding
the military, forces of the United States
in the Philippines, with a request for
permission to telegraph it' to the United
States. 'The correspondents also asked
for permission -to cable their respective
papers air the facts and different
phases of events as they transpired
here. The correspondents had two long
interviews with General Otis, in the
course of which they claimed that the
evident purpose of the censorship was
not to keep information from the
enemy, but to keep from the public a
knowledge of the real condition of af
fair^ here.. It was also asserted by the
correspondents that' newspapers print
ed in Manila, which reach the enemy
weekly, are permitted to publish state
ments similar to those which corre
spondents , are forbidden to cable. It
was made clear to General Otis that
the objection was to the system and
not to the censor: .b';V,
General. Otis finally promised greater
liberality, agreeing to pass all matter
that he might .consider not detrimental
to the interests of the United States.
General Otis appointed Captaiin Green

AGUINALDO'S DIRECT
OVERTURES FOR PEACE
' CALL HEADQUARTERS. WELLINGTON HOTEL, WASHINGTON,
July 17.â Important cablegrams have been received at the State Depart
ment from the Philippine Commission and at the War Department from
General Otis concerning a new move in the direction of peace. These
dispatches have been in the hands of the President for several days,
but he has declined to make them public because the ultra-optimistic
views heretofore received from the same source have not been borne out
by subsequent events. The latest dispatches, however, are more encour
aging than previous ones, but the President wishes to have some posi
tive results before making them public. All that can be learned definite
ly about them Is that direct overtures for peace have been made to
General Otis by Aguinaldo and some of his principal leaders. I was
told by a Cabinet official to-night that if the promises are fulfilled the
volunteers now being enlisted will not be needed.
ditions among the Filipinos in respect to
dissension and demoralization result ng
from the American campaign and to the
brigand character of their army.
We believe the dispatches err In .the
declaration "that the situation Is well in
hand." and the assumption that the'ln
surrection can be speedily ended without
a greatly increased force. . yy
We think the tenacity of the Filipino
.purpose has been underestimated, and
that the statements are unfounded that
volunteers are willing to engage in fur
ther service.
The censorship has compelled -us to par
ticipate In this misrepresentation by ex
ercising or altering uncontroverted. state
ments of facts, on the plea .^ as General
Otis stated, "that they would alarm the
people at home." or "have, the people of
the United States by the ears. ' - â

CORPORATIONS
CANNOT ESCAPE
j^ep^bTican Supervisors increase the
of wealthy Ta,*
Shakers by $700,000.
REPRESENTATIVES of tax-shirking corporations spent several unpleasant hours yesterday before
the Board of Supervisors, During the morning and afternoon the Board held its final sessions as a
Board of Equalization. Business of vital public importance was transacted, and it is owing to
the persistent energies of the Republican members, opposed by the Democratic members and antagonized
by Assessor Dodge, that the assessments of some of the great corporations have been raised, valuations of
small holdings have been reduced, unjust discrimination in fixing taxable values has been exposed and a
more equitable distribution of tax burdens has been made.
After a thorough investigation of the assessment made by Dr. Dodge the Republican Supervisors
saw that gross discrimination had been made and certain corporations had been protected at the expense
of the small property-owners. Realizing this fact and seeking to remedy the injustice, the Board raised
the assessment of the Market-street Railway Company by $600,000, making the total $16,323,101.
The assessment of the Oakland Water Company was raised from $400,000 to $500,000, and none of the
other heavy corporation assessments were seduced.
The Republican members of the Board also made every effort to increase other assessments which are
inadequate. Two notable cases were Wells, Fargo & Co. and the Sutter-street Railroad Company, but
every endeavor to raise these assessments was opposed by Assessor Dodge for reasons that he did not ex
plain. He admitted that he had discriminated in favor of the Sutter-strÂ«et Railroad Company and other
corporations, but he refused to agree to any increase.
While the sum of $700,000 has been added to the taxable value of the corporations, the total assess
ment of the city and county has not been raised. The Supervisors did not commit Assessor Dodge's blun
der and inflict upon San Francisco an unjust tax burden by the State authorities. While the corporations
will pay more, the small property-owners will pay less. The appeals of poor people were answered and
justice but not favoritism was shown to the corporations.
THE Supervisors lost no time yes
terday morning in attacking the
important phases of their duties
as a Board of Equalization. Dil
atory tactics on the part of the
Democratic members, who sympathize
with Assessor Dodge's estimate, had al
ready prevented the accomplishment of
much good, so the Republicans began
their work with a will. Before the day
was over they had performed one of the
most important public benefits in their
official careers.
"Which of these protests shall we
take up first?" inquired Mayor Phelan.
"I would suggest it be that of the Mar
\ ket-street Railway Company; it is the
i most important of the corporation." "I
think that is right," assented Super
! visor Aigeltlnger. "we have heard
! something which "

the committee-room, and in answer
! came Henry Lynch, superintendent of
the system, J. A. Foulds, attorney, and

Mr. Ryan introduced Mr. Lynch, .who

crwdty for it developed. There was not

WASHINGTON, July 17.â "Either
Major General Otis or the newspaper
correspondents must go. To deport
the correspondents will probably be ac
cepted at home and abroad to be a re
turn to the old "Spanish method of
muzzling the press. To relieve Major
General Otis will mean an official ac

This is the way a member of the
Cabinet with whom I talked this even
ing stated the problem which confronts
the administration as the result of the
publication of the newspaper corre
spondents' "round robin," protesting
against the course of General Otis. .

what he was talking about. "Well,"
said Mr. Lynch. "I don't know that I
have much to say, only these assess
ments are too high." Asked why he
thought so, Mr. Lynch made an attempt
to explain and continued to make no
progress until Mayor Phelan suggested
the line of argument that should be
pursued.
"What was the market value of the
stocks and bonds of your system in
March last?" he asked.
"There were between 31,000 and 32,
--000 shares out," was the irrelevant an
swer. "But what was their value?"
persisted the Mayor. And the troubles
that hereafter multiplied for Lynch be
gan. He took his flrst step in the maze
by attempting an answer in generali
ties*. Black Ryan, who can always ex
plain, looked on compassionately. Mr.
Foulds, pressed to the issue, offered Mr.
Lynch a tabulated statement with
which to refresh his fagged memory.
"There were stocks aVid bonds to the
amount of $16,996,000," said Mr. Lynch.
"There were 83,000 shares on the market
at 63â 55,229,000 in all. I think 186,170
shares have been issued in all at a par
value of $11,728,710."
â¢ Mayor Phelan asked why Mr. Lynch
gave the par value rather than the
market value of the company's bonds.
He said it was upon the market value
that the assessment of the corporation's
intangible assets had been computed.
Lynch replied that the market value
of the bonds should not be considered,
as interest was paid only on the par
value and the earning capacity of the
bonds, consequently not influenced by
the premium that might exist upon the
paper in the market.
"Besides, market values on stocks
and bonds are so often fictitious," mod
estly submitted Mr. Foulds.
"These bonds are not In the market,
they are in our treasury," suggested
the purpling Mr. Ryan to the involved
Mr. Lynch, sotto voce. "Yes, they are
not in the market," echoed Mr. Lynch,
and he looked entreatingly around for
another tip. Mr. Foulds thought it
best to take up the tangled thread him
self, and ignoring the formality of be
ing sworn said he could not understand
why the Assessor had taken the market
rather than the par value of the com
pany's bonds as a basis of assessment
of the company's intangible property,
or, in simple words, the company's
franchise.
Dodge broke In with the statement
that he had taken the market value of
the stock and of the bonds as well as
the best criterion of the value of the
property intangible and tangible that
was behind them, the value of which
warranted the buying public in offer
ing 15 per cent premium on the bonds
and $63 per share for the stock. Dodge
did not say that he had assessed the
bonds directly. For the sake of well
simulated argument, however. Foulds
assumed that such was the Assessor's
mistake. ' .
- "There seems to be a great deal of
confusion." said he. "I shall attempt
to explain. The Assessor and his
Honor seem to think that the bonds
themselves have been assessed. This
is not so; it is the property which these
bonds represent, our right to do busi
ness, which he has attempted to put a
valuation upon. The only proper way
to arrive at such a result is to take the
par value of our bonds ($100) as the
bonds at par represent, the actual
value; the market rate has nothing
whatever to do with it."
"Why not?" pertinently inquired
Supervisor Collins.
"Why not" was precisely what the
prolix Mr. Foulds was not seeking op
portunity to tell, nor did he. He simply
reiterated that the earning capacity of
the bonds Was governed by the mort
gage which they secured and in no wise
by the market value at which they
might obtain.
Mayor Phelan asked Mr. Foulds what
he had to urge as a reason he had not
made a statement of the par value of
the bonds in preparing for assessment.
"The Market-street Company ' has not
paid its just share of taxes for ten
year* " said he, nicely. 'v a>
"The entire value of your stocks and
bonds on which you have paid interest
and:builded up a surplus 500.000 is
$26,000,000, and you quibble at paying
taxes . on. $15,000,000," continued his
Honor. â¢'..-'â¢_ : . ' ': â¢
. "I want to say," said Dr. . Dodge at
this point, "that I have been more than
fair, with the corporations, and they
can see it if they will look Into it.
Whenever I could I have given them
the benefit of the doubt and have as
sessed them at a lower rate than indi
vidual holders when I have been able
to do so. I did not Want to hear the
cry that I was cinching the corpora
. tions."
And. then out. came the meat of the
whole harangue why a morning had
i been given over. by Assessor Dodge and
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
assessed in argument that was but
weak subterfuge and weaker figures
over nothing but "intangible property."
In an instant it developed that this
quibble and apparent ill feeling that
had arisen in an argument solely over
a comparative bagatelle of $800,000 on
the franchise was calculated to furnish
the reason and be the excuse for a re
duction of $3,555,550 along every- line of
the monopoly's property tangible as
well as "untangible."
Assessor Dodge let that kitten out of
the bag when, in answer to a question
from Supervisor Collins Dr. Dodge ad
mitted flatly that while he had assessed
the real estate of the individual prop
erty holder the man who owns his
horne at from seventy-five to ninety
per cent of its actual value, he had as
sessed the "tangible" property of the
Market Street Railway Company at but
sixty per cent, and in some cases at
fifty cent.
Supervisor Collins gasped, Mayor
Phelan cast a soulful eye of entreaty
at the Assessor. Mr. E. Black Ryan
merely fidgeted. Mr. Foulds came to
the front with the brave statement,
which was calculated to fill an embar
rassing pause, that he considered that
he had convinced his hearers that the
figures of Assessor Dodge were out of
all reason; that he thought his $800,000
argument fully warranted a reduction
.of. three .million, and a..half. Then he
I closed his case.
Mr. Ryan, however, was not so sure
of that argument. For once the little
politician of the Southern Pacific was
rattled. His perception had not been
dulled by the difficulties of a bad argu
ment and he had not been blind to the
effect Assessor Dodge's admission had
had upon even those who have been
considered the most unregenerate of
the board. It came to them all as a
substantiation of a grist of rumors that
have persisted ever since the board sat
as a body of equalizers and Assessor
Dodge's involved figures were brought
out where they could be seen.
For days residents of the Panhandle
district had been asking why the as
sessments along the line of that pro
posed flower garden had been figured
at so much higher a figure than other
properties in other sections which was
considered quite as desirable for resi
dence purposes. Individuals who owned
blocks next to and like their neighbors
had asked why theirs was the higher
by several per cent than the other.
Bankers with a hundred thousand dol
lars in deposits had been in to ask why
their franchises were assessed at $2500
and the franchises of banking institu
tions whose deposits bumped around
among- the millions were set down at
only $5000, or at the most $10,000.
Rumors of such unjust discrimination
were of daily occurrence, and the un
guarded admission of the almost always
astute Dr. Dodge had given them the
confirmation which they might have al
ways lacked. It was apparently fur
ther to conceal this break that Mr.
Ryan kicked up a little argument on
his own account with Dr. Dodge on the
other side of the question. It involved
only a couple of hundred thousand dol
lars, however, and was dismissed by ,
the board as frivolous. Mr. Ryan, Mr.
Lynch and Mr. Foulds were allowed to
depart.
Supervisor Phelps went into the main
chamber and talked for a moment with
Lynch. Mr. Byington moved that the
Assessor's figures be allowed to stand.
Mr. Phelps promptly moved as an
amendment that the Market Street
Railway Company's assessment be re
duced $1,000,000.
"Assessor Dodge, did I understand
you to say that you had assessed pri
vate property owners at seventy-five
and ninety per cent and the Market
Street Railway Company at only from
fifty to sixty per cent?" suddenly de
manded Supervisor Collins.
"Why, yes, you see I "
"Then it seems. to me that instead of
being reduced this assessment should
be raised. I see no reason why the
private property, holders should be dis
criminated against in favor of the cor
porations. I move as a substitute that
the assessment of the Market Street
Company's franchise be raised $600,00<^
and that that amount be added to thS
franchise." â¢ yy'yy
"I second that motion," said Aigel
tlnger. "And I." chorused Perrault,
and then the motion was put, and only-
Mr. Phelps, who had talked with
Mr. Lynch, voted against it.
Then some one said Spring Valley.
The representative of the water com
pany had been waiting all the morning
and should be heard, but somehow or
other the Oakland Water Company got
first place and Dr. Dodge was afforded
an opportunity to come out in the open
and defend another of his assessments
against an unsought increase. The
Oakland Water Company, for reasons
best known to itself, does business
across the bay and keeps its Incorpora
tion papers on file in this city. Until
this year its franchise had not been
assessed. Dr. Dodge appraised it at
$400,000. Aigeltlnger said it was the in
tention to run that figure up to $600.
--000, and Dodge strongly objected. He
said he had consulted with Assessor
Dalton. of Alameda County and from
facts supplied by him knew that he had
assessed the company fairly. "We do
not want to assess them to the extent
that we will drive them from the
county," said he. "I think $400,000 is

of the adventures of John W. Clark. Her
story to him was that of a distracted wife
to an indulgent husband. Mrs. Ettring
ham is an unfortunate woman. She is
possessed of a weak mind, incapable of
withstanding the approaches of a design
ing scoundrel. She was once the inmate
of an asylum, but her existence seems to
center upon that of her husband and
child. The story she poured into the Et
tringham ear was one that astounded
him. She related how Clark came to
their home on Friday morning and asked
for something to eat. She was frightened,
but granted his request. He told of a
wife and baby he had left in Missouri and
worked upon her naturally sympathetic
nature until he gained the upper hand.
She was complaining of pains in the
head and stomach and mentioning the
â  fact that she was suffering, he posed as
a doctor and diagnosed her case as o_le
of the stomach and head. Then she was
persuaded to take drugs, which caused
her to become unconscious and the vic
tim of her visitor.
After a family council an arrangement
was made by which Clark could be
caught. Ettringham decided to leave t*Â»e
house with his lunch bucket as if going
to work as usual. He would then return
and while he went toward the house by
one route John Batto, his brother-in-law,
and his son would each close in by dif
ferent paths and thus cut off the possible â¢
retreat of Clark. The scheme was car- j
ried out to the letter.
Ettringham hid his rifle in the vineyard j
near the house, and on his return, accord
ing to the preconcerted plan, this morn- j
ing secured it. As he did so the sound of
voices came to his ears, and he knew
Clark was in the bouse. He advanced to
ward the door. As he did so a scream ;
was heard, and he saw his wife run out ;
of the door. Clark followed her, and seiz
ing her by the wrist attempted to drag \
her back into the house. As he did so the
now thoroughly enraged husband called
to him to throw up his hands. Clark
dropped the coat which was on his arm
and threw One hand behind him. Think
ing that he was about to draw a weapon
Ettringham threw his rifle to his shoulder
and fired. Clark ran and another shot
was fired, but the first .had gone home
and Clark dropped dead. -. -.
Ettringham rode to Murphys and gave
himself up to the officers.
The body of Clark was examined and a
miscellaneous assortment of things was
found upon him. On his coat was a J
badge bearing the name of "John W.
Clark. First Arkansas Volunteers. Span- I
ish-American War." A discharge granted
for disability at San. Francisco was found :
among his effects. He was a stranger
here.
At the Coroner's inquest; held to-day. a
â¢ verdict was rendered to the effect tiiat the
killing was justifiable homicide, and ex
onerating Ettringham.

enough, as they do no business here
and lake no money from the county."
ln deference to the Assessor's opinion
Mr. Aigeltinger cut down the board's
intentions $100,000 and moved that the
assessment be increased to $500,000.
Again Phelps was the sole negative.
"I move we reconsider the vote where
by we denied the protest of the Sutter
Street Railway Company. From facts
1 have gathered I think its assessment
should be materially raised." The mo
tion came from Aigeltinger. "I thought
that had been disposed of," objected
Dodge. Mayor Phelan ordered Attorney j
Freidenrich called in. Attorney Freid- j
enrich was surprised and impressed
upon the board that he did not appear
as the representative of the company.
He was questioned pro and con, but
could furnish absolutely no informa
tion. Mayor Phelan, however, made a
hot bundle of it, to the distress of the
Assessor. A question from his Honor
called up that argument over the par
ity and premium of the Market Street
bonds. Asked on what basis he had ap
praised the Sutter Street Company,
Dodge was obliged to confess he had
figured the bonds at their par value,
instead of at their market value, as in
the case of the Market Street Corpora
tion.
Asked why he had seen fit to change
his system of calculation, he lamely an
swered that the secretary of the com
pany had declined to let him see the
books. Freidenrich helped him out with
the statement that he did not think the
bonds of the company were listed.
Attorney Kellogg and Engineer
Brooks of the Spring Valley Water
Company came in to tell why the com
pany's assessment should be reduced
over $2,000,000. Their argument was
practically the same as that made on
Thursday last; that the board had* es
timated the company's taxes when it
figured the water rate and that it now
had no right to subtract from its legal
income by. allowing a heavy assessment.
Dodge and Kellogg indulged in a
lengthy argument on the cost of pipe
laying. Questions, well-directed, devel
oped the fact that Spring Valley had
been dealt as kindly by as had the Mar
ket-street Company. The value of the
corporation's stocks and bonds was
found to be $25,000,000, the assessment
but $8,000,000, but the figures had been
60 cleverly juggled that the board could
find no place on which to hang an in
crease in assessment. It gave it up as
a thankless task and allowed the as
sessment to stand as it was.
The San Francisco Gas and Electric
Company, assessed at $6,178,612, and the
Pacific Gas Improvement Company,
with property valued at $2,440,000, were
found in the same cleverly accom
plished condition, and were also let
alone. The Contra Costa Water Com
pany, with only its corporation papers
in* this city, was allowed to stand at
$750,000, the assessment : on its fran
chise.
Wells, Fargo & Co., one of the slip
periest tax shirkers in the lot, had got
rid of most of its taxable holdings by
shipping them out to its branch banks
and, although the board was resolved
to for once compel that institution to
Bhare its just portion of the tax burden,
It could flnd nothing more to.tax.. : . â¢_-
At the afternoon session the most im
portant matter under consideration
was the assessment of the Sutter-street
Railway Company. It was .understood
that this corporation would send repre
sentatives to the board to show cause
why the assessed valuation of its prop
erty should not be raised. The corpora
tion sent no agent, ever, and Super
visor Aigeltinger moved that the as
lessment of the company increased
190,000. - "~ â¢

Special Dispatch to The Call.
CALL HEADQUARTERS. SANTA
CRUZ, July 17.â Camp Fallon has as
sumed the appearance and discipline
of a regular army encampment.
The routine laid out hy the com
manding officer Is being followed out
to the letter. The League of tne
Cross Cadets have taken to their
duties like old campaigners and are rap-
Idly becoming familiar with the interest
ing ceremonies that are enacted daily in
camp. Of the 340 officers and men now
in camp but one is. occupying the hospi
tal tent, and the young man would not be
in that condition if he had not tried to
smoke a strong pipe.
Hundreds of visitors inspected the camp
yesterday and to-day. The cadets enter
tained them with songs and music and
displayed the Interior decorations of their
tents." The usual routine was observed
to-day! Camp was awakened at 5:20 a. m.
by reveille. As the last note of the fa
miliar call was heard the regimental
band struck up the "Star-spangled Ban
ner" and the stars and stripes were raised
and the gun boomed. Breakfast, as usual,
was eagerly waited for by the whole reg
iment. The food prepared by Cateier
Abrams is of good quality and is to the
satisfaction of the entire regiment. The
boys' appetites are made keen by the
open-air exercise and they are proving
good trenchermen. : â â¢
At 7:10 the three battalions, in command
of Majors McGloin, Deasy and McCarthy,
were marched into the baseball grounds
and were put through an hour's drill. The
boys enjoyed their maneuvering, as was
evidenced In the enthusiastic way they
charged with drawn swords at an Imag
inary enemy. Guard mounting is proving
as great a feature as dress parade. Tne
former ceremony was enacted at 9 o'clock
and was watched by a large crowd. The
picturesque spectacle was gone through
with few errors and showed that the ca
dets have been carefully drilled, 'ihe
presence of the fiand at guard mount is a
feature. Dress parade in the afternoon at
tracted the usual large crowd of visitors
and residents of the city.
In the evening the cadets gave a dance
in the Dolphin boathouse. Music was fur
nished by members of the band and danc
ing was kept up until a late hour.
Archbishop Riordan is expected to ar
rive at Camp Fallon to-morrow. It is un
derstood that the regiment will march
down to the depot and escort him to camp
on his arrival.
The regimental band will give a con
cert on the veranda of the St. George ho
tel next Thursday night. The following
programme" has been arranged by Freu
Neuberger, the leader of the band: March,
(Chan); waltz, "Blue Danube"; selections
from Clorindy; rag time skedaddle;
march, "Bride-elect"; Plantation echoes-
Georgia campmeeting; "Whistling Rufus"
and march. W. M. B.
The same evening the regiment will
march uptown and hold dress parade in
front ol the hotel. -
A baseball game will be played by the
officers of the regiment to-morrow. The
probable line-up will be as follows:
Father Dempsey Catcher Lieut. Carroll (D)
Capt. Duffy Pitcher Lieut. Touhey (G)
Capt. Sullivan.. Shortstop Capt. Powers (G)
Maj. Morrissey- First base ...Capt. Hopper (A)
Lieut. Mahoney. Second baÃe.Capt. Monahan (L)
Maj. McCarthy. Third base Capt. Dixon (G)
Lieut. Ke11y.... Right field. ..Capt. Bannon (C)
Lleut.-Col. Ryan Left field Capt. Dwyer (D)
Mr. Levy Center field.. Lieut. Malone (E)
Major McGloin Is sad. His condition of
I mind was brought on by a joke played on
to any Increase In the assessment. He ]
said that he felt sure that the corpora
tion would resent the assessment, carry
the controversy into the courts and per
haps invalidate the entire assessment.
Supervisor Aigeltinger pleaded that the
board, in justice to itself, should raise
the assessment. His motion did not
prevail, however, and there the matter
ended. b~; -
The rest of the afternoon was con
sumed in listening to the appeals of
poor property owners, small business
men and merchants. In most Instances
the appeals for relief were granted and
many thousands of dollars were taken
off the assessments of these people that
had suffered from . discrimination.
When the last complaint had been
heard the board adjourned as a Board
of Equalization. The last day's work
had been a profitable one for the city
and its people. '-b
An intimation has been made that an
attempt will be made to have the in
creased assessments declared Illegal on ;
the ground that the corporations were
not notified that their assessments were
to be increased. If such a contention
be made it will fall, as the Supervi
sors acted fully within the meaning and
letter of the law. They gave every in
terested corporation a hearing and
nothing more was necessary.

He ls a member of the bugle corps, and, although he is the youngest
member in that branch of the regiment, he surpasses his elders in playing the
bugle. He was on duty the first night In camp, and when ln the stillness of
the night he blew taps, every one paused to listen to the sweet music, as
it was artistically rendered. Colonel Sullivan is proud of the youngster, as is
also every officer and member of the regiment. Willie has been a member,
of the League of the Cross Cadets for the past three months. He began
playing the bugle a year ago,; and in that short time has mastered it.
him by brother officers. While the major
was attending to duty elsewhere, the
"Owls" took advantage of his absence
and made a mound out of the sawdust In
his tent and on the top of it placed a
brick and some evergreens. His nice new
duck trousers were placed at the foot of
the pile, as was also his sword. A sign
Inviting him to rest in peace was tacked
on the center pole and one of the buglers
was prevailed on to play "taps." Major
McGloin did not take kindly to the joke.
He thought it was too grave a one to play
on an officer of his station.
On Invitation of members of the Santa
Cruz Naval Reserve a party of cadets left
camp on Sunday afternoon for a five-mile
row on one of the reserve's cutters. The
boys went to Capitola. and on landing
marched through the town together. The
sound of their bugles attracted the atten
tion of the summer residents there and
they gave the soldiers and sailors a fit
ting reception. The boat was in charge
of Ensign Thomas Armstrong. The fol
lowing cadets were in charge of First Ser

Private Watson of Company A is in
disgrace. At dinner Sunday night he re
marked that the reason why the regiment
had a chicken feast was due wholly to
the baseball game this afternoon.
He completed his reasons by asserting
that the cooks stood outside the baseball
grounds during the game between Santa
Cruz and San Jose and caught all the
"fouls" and prepared' them for dinner.
Needless to say that he nearly lost his
life. Jf,:.ryr yy
Captain Bannon .distinguished himself
yesterday by putting on a pair of leggins
according to his own idea. When his
mistake was discovered he was "joshed,"
and his unsympathetic brother officers re
called how Father Dempsey made the
same mistake at a previous encampment.
Benjamin McKinley, first sergeant of
Company A. said to be a nephew of the
President, has bought a number of gold
for removal of buildings which obstruct Hooper

Special Dispatch to The Call.
SPOKANE, July 17.â A most sensa
tional suit was begun to-day in the Su
perior Court of this county. Colonel I.
N. Peyton, until recently president of
the Exchange National Bank, owner of
the big Peyton block, and identified
with a number of big; mining companies
in the Northwest, is made defendant in
an action brought by a former wife now
living in Denver, Colo. The woman's
name is Helen M. Peyton. She recites
how Colonel Peyton came to Spokane
under the assumed name of Colonel
George H. Morgan and acquired con
siderable property. It is further al
leged "that "he . pretended to marry
another woman named Victor Hough
ton, and is now unlawfully living and
cohabiting with said woman as his
wife." fyo
Allegations of fraud in the settlement
of a former action are made against the
colonel. Suit is now begun by the for- |
mer wife to recover half of the prop- ]
erty of the oolonel, the "value of which j
is estimated at over $1,000,000. 'yf-fff
Colonel Peyton is one of the most |
prominent men of the Northwest, and I
was a heavy stockholder in the Lerni
mine. His wife is a society leader here
and the patroness of a big society event
âa muslcale to be given to-morrow at
the Westminster. Congregational
Church. frfyJ:
Briefly, the complaint recites that
Peyton and the plaintiff were. married
in February, 1869, at Champaign, 111.,
and later moved to Colorado. In 1878
| Peyton deserted her and she never saw
! him again until 1886, when she learned
i he was living in this city under the
1 name of Colonel George H. Morgan.
Peyton's change of name is known to
old residents, as Peyton to-day owns
land in Morgan's addition, which he
platted when he bore that cognomen.
Continuing, the complaint says that
under the name of Morgan in 1886 Pey
ton married Miss Houghton, his pres
ent wife. The next month the plaintiff
brought suit for a share of the prop
erty Peyton had acquired, and in De
cember Peyton gave her $3000 in notes,
saying he owned but $6000 worth of
property. In this, she says, he deceived
her. She asserts he owns mining stock
and real estate in Santa Barbara, Cal.
She asks the court to compel him to
make an accounting and to give her
half his property and that he be re
quired to pay her alimony pending the
litigation and cash for court costs and
attorney's fees.
The complaint was filed late to-night
and is consequently not generally
known, but It promises to create an
even greater sensation than did the suit
between the parties In earlier days, one
result of which was that Colonel Mor
gan became Colonel Peyton in name.

correspondents should be deported.
I have good authority for saying the
President has given serious thought to
the appointment of a new commanding
general for the military forces in the
Philippines when active operations are
resumed in the autumn. He feels that
there is too much for one man to do.
The fact that General Otis underesti
mates the number of men required to
cope with the situation has demon
strated that he has not had time to
consider properly the real demands of
the situation. When Major General
Lawton was sent to Manila it was the
understanding that he would have con
trol of the military operations under
General Otis, while the latter should
attend to the duties of Governor Gen
eral. Apparently General Lawton has
not been given the authority intended.
In applying such a strict censorship
to the press dispatches, it can be safely
asserted that _ General Otis has not
acted under instructions from Wash
ington. The President has never been
in favor of rigid censorship.. He wants
the truth to be known. Some time ago
a newspaper complained to the Presi
dent that its dispatches were being cen
sored too strictly, and the President
directed the relief of the censor, and
another officer was assigned to duty in
his tdl&cb
Secretary Hay, in speaking of the
< "round robin," thought It not possible
to believe that all the officers and per
sons who have returned from the Phil
i ippines, and have written to him, are in
a conspiracy to lie in support of Gen
i eral Otis. Secretary Long said he knew
; of no dispatches being suppressed, cx
i cept those dealing with the plans of
j campaigns.
In ' military circles some officials de
i clare if they were in Otis' place they
would immediately deport the corre
! spondents. I learned to-day that
i Lieutenant Colonel Thompson, chief
; signal officer at Manila, recently wrote
| to a friend in Washington, deploring
I the strict censorship he was compelled
j to maintain, arid explaining that corre
spondents were compelled to work in
cessantly to obtain facts concerning the
movements of troops, etc., yet, under
his orders, he was compelled to cut their
I dispatches.
With respect to the alleged minimiza
tion of naval operations, private letters
received here indicate that the corre
spondents have had much difficulty in
getting reports of naval operations by
the censor," and as Colonel Thompson
disavows responsibility for this it. Is
presumed that General "Otis directed
that some of the statements concerning
warships be stricken out.
Officials of the War Department say
that, with the exception of plans of
the campaign, every dispatch received
from Manila has been made public.
They fear now, however, that the
"round robin" will give the impression
to the country that Washington has
concealed facts which the people should
know. This impression may be made
use of by anti-imperialists, who have
repeatedly declared that the United
States has not made much headway in
the Philippines, and .unless the insur
rection is crushed by the time Congress
reassembles it is likely to be used to
keep up the agitation of hope of bring
ing abcrut a withdrawal "of the" "Amer

anent his homeward trip:
"My Government has been exceedingly
kind and obliging to me in informing me
that I may take whatever route home
ward I wish and take as long as I like
about it. The people of San Franclscj,
who were anxious that I should come
home that way, were good enough to
think that what I did at Manila savad
their coast from being raided by a foreign
fleet. But I do not agree with them in
that. The Spanish squadron could not
have gone so far from Manila. Gladly
would I have returned by that route had
it been possible. As it is, I will not ar
rive at New York until October."
. The admiral declared himself unwilling
to discuss the situation in the Philippines.
He asked the British view of German ac

being told that Spain was receiving more
than a million pounds sterling and a coal

expressed great surprise and exclaimed:
"Poor Spain has now nothing left in East

THUS DECLARES A CORONER'S JURY
NEWMAN. July 17.â The Coroner
of Stanislaus County to-day con- !
eluded the inquiry relating to the j
Newman disaster. The Investi- j
gation clearly demonstrated that ,
the Southern Pacific's system of _ sig- |
naling by semaphore and whistle ,
should be instantly revised. To one en- ,
gineer a white light, changed from red \
to white, means a clear track, and to
another it means something else, lt is
a source of gratification that the jury
finds some living persons connected
with the Southern Pacific responsible
for the disaster. A train dispatcher
whose orders were vague and an en
gineer whose experience was limited
are held accountable for the crash.
J. M. Walthal. District Attorney of
Stanislaus County, came over by team
from Modesto this morning, accompanied
by Assistant L. L. Dennett. Deputy Coro
ner W. S. Bowker and N. E. Leek, official
stenographer, to conduct the inquiry. The
Jury impaneled immediately after the
disaster was convened at Fisher s Hall
at 10 o'clock. The District Attorney di
rected that all witnesses, except the wit
ness on the stand, be excluded from the
room. The jurors were enjoined to give
their undivided attention to the testimony
regarding the death of the women in the
â¢wreck and were Informed that it was
their duty and privilege to ask questions. ;
E. D. Luckev, principal of a St. Louis j
school, who had charge of the special ex
cursion party, was the first witness * ailed
He described the crash, the hissing of
steam and the scenes of the wreck, tellinj,
how the car was filled with timbers and
iron wrapped around the bed clothing, tie
designated the sections of the car and
their respective occupants. He testified
that Mrs. Thomas was dead when he went
to her assistance. Miss Harris also was
dead when taken from the wreck. In re
ply to questions asked by Juror A. M.
Williams the witness said there was no
baggage car between the engine and first ;
sleeper from Ogden on. He asked the
vardmaster at Ogden to put the foremost :
car in the center of the tram but tag
request was not granted. It was disclosed
In the testimony that Fireman I reigh
took Miss White from the wreck.
Dr ii V Armistead, Southern Pacific
physician at this place, testified to having
cared for those injured in the wreck. He
made an autopsy ln the case of the two ;
women killed. Mrs. Thomas neck was
broken and Miss Harris was killed by con
cussion. ; . Â«.Â»__..
J H. Madden, night watchman and dep
uty constable at Newman, heard the ap
proaching special and noted the two
whistles signifying that everything was
right Presently he heard the crash and
â went to the wreck to help. He assisted in
extricating the passengers. He testified j
that Mrs. Thomas' neck was doubled
around a marble washstand. Miss Harris !
was covered by timbers and clothing. he
night watchman testified positively that
he heard the long whistle of the special,
the four blasts for the crossing and the
two whistles signifying answer to a clear
track signal. In reply to Juror Sturgeon,
Mr Madden said there was no caboose
on the freight train. There were no
lights on the rear of the freight train.
c E. Hartwell, telegraph operator for
the Southern Pacific Company at New
man, was called. He testified that he had
worked as a dispatcher and operator for
thirty-four years. The witness produced
a memorandum of all trains that passed
Newman after midnight of the morning
of the wreck. He explained the red light
as the standing light. Unless a white light
is shown the signal Is "orders. the
white light signifies "no orders."
"No orders were given me regarding
this extra train." he said. "I only knew
from messages over the wires that the ex
tra was coming. Train 246, the freight,
arrived at 2:32. A white light was dis- j
played for 247_. The freight stopped. It
s-tood on the main track. An extra has
no me and is never due. The extra that
was In the accident got orders west of
here. I did not know the time that the
train would reach here. I could only
guess from the time that it left Tracy.
The freight, being a regular train, had
the right of the main track, and the ex
tra should have approached slowly."
Mr. Hartwell requested the District At
torney to read to the jury rule 80, which
requires all extra trains to slowly ap
proach all watering and coaling stations.
The rule was read as requested. The wit
ness testified further that emphatically it
was the duty of the extra, to slow down.
"I heard the whistle of the extra be
tween 2:37 and 2:3Â»." he continued. "When
the extra came to Newman a white light
was displayed. The signal showed white
to indicate that there was a trail* at the
station. The white signal was showing
when the whistle of the extra was heard.
1 changed to the red disk for an Instant,
and then showed the white.
District Attorneyâ were the conductor
and" brakeman of the freight train?
Mr. Hartwell The conductor was entering
the telegraph office with his register. I do
not know where the others were. I heard the
crash Just as the conductor was entering my
office. He exclaimed: "They have struck me."
I did not go to the scene of the wreck. My
duties required my presence in the office. I
received no orders for any of the trains. I have
no means of knowing whether the extra had
orders to pass 245 at this point. The extra must
have known that the freight was here. The
semaphore showed that a train was at the sta
tion, for white must stand while the train is at I
the station. On the arrival of the freight I !
signaled, White. The signal does not undertake !
to show the condition of the track.
Questionâ lf you had shown the signal red
would not the extra have stopped?
Answer â The train would have stopped and j
the conductor come to the office. It would i
not have stopped sooner than lt did. The white j
s'gnal simply told the extra that there were '
no orders. When the Owl passes the signal |
changes from red to white and back to red
when the train passes. The light at the switch
pronounced the rails standing for the main
line I had no orders for either train and my I

THE VERDICT.
NEWMAN, July 17.â
The jury at 8 o'clock
brought in its verdict.
After reciting in the usual
form the age, nativity and
residence of the two vic
tims and the cause of death
in the collision between
trains 245 and 1721 of the
Southern Pacific Railroad,
the findings conclude:
"And we further find
that said collision was
caused by the vague and
indefinite orders issued by
the train dispatcher and by
the further fact that the en
gineer in charge of train
1 72 1 was inexperienced
and incompetent for that
reason."

signals specified that fact My signals were
correct. The regular train had the right to the
main track. The services of this office were not
called Into requisition except to display the
signals, which were correctly displayed.
In reply to questions by Jurors Crow.
Williams and Sturgeon the witness" said
only two or three seconds were required
to change the signals. The four blasts
of the whistle call upon the operator to
signify If he has any orders.
F. A. Poland, train dispatcher at Oak
land pier, was called and testified that he
had been in the service of the Southern
Pacific eighteen years and had been dis
patcher at Oakland pier fourteen years.
He goes on duty at 11:30 p. m. and re
mains at the post until 8 a. m. The wit
ness produced a memorandum as follows
of orders given to four trains, which or
ders were repeated from Tracy to the
pier:
MONDAY, July 10, '99.
Ow. July 10. '99.

O. K.
F. A. P.
12:05 a. m. ,
Eng. 1725 and Eng. 1721 will run extra Tracy
to Mendota. Will pass No. 241 Eng. 1717 and
No. 245 Eng. 1403 when overtaken.
Signed by conductors and engineer as a re
ceipt of order.
Resuming his testimony, the train dis
patcher said:
The 'conductor of the extra knew that he' was
within four minutes of the time of 245. He
must have known this when he was approach
ing Newman, as he had the time card. . I told
Hartwell over the wire to hurry 245 out of
Newman to Volta. The board would then have
held the extra ten minutes. The order gave
245 the privilege of waiting to allow the extra
to pass at Newman. The engineer of the extra
should have had his train under control. The
white signal simply said "no orders" and indi
cated that he could go through If the other
train had gone on. Th* rule as a matter of
safety might be construed to keep the signal
red while there is a train at the station. The
conductor of the special should have had his
train under full control without regard to
signals. The conductor of 245, the freight.
should have had a man out with a hand
signal. There Is no yard limit signal on this
line. There Is no fixed point for stopping when
the signal Is red. The conductor closing up,
as in this case, should have consulted the engi
neer. He should have known that he was
approaching dangerous ground. Hartwell told
me over the wire that 245 was here. That was
before the train was struckâ two minutes be
fore. I told him to hurry 24.7 out to Volta. I
knew that 245 could get to Volta on her rights.
Then Hartwell said: "They have struck."
Hartwell was not able to see the conductor of
the freight to hurry' him.
Responding to general questions by the
attorney as to the number of hours that
the trainmen had been on duty the wit
ness said that no man was ever sent out
who said he needed rest. Train Dispatch
er Poland said there was no rule requir
ing a baggage car to be placed between
the engine and the first passenger coach.
It was customary to so make up trains,
but It was not a regulation.
J D. Moffitt. conductor of freight 245.
was the next witness. He has been work
ing for the Southern Pacific fourteen
years. He arrived here on timeâ
a. m.. July 10. He testified:
I had no orders to remain here. A white slg
the murderous robber struck him over the |
head with the butt end of his revolver. |
Inflicting an ugly scalp wound.
Without waiting to empty the till or to
secure whatever valuables were in the
store, the desperate pair, after firing sev- :
eral more shots over the heads of the J
terror-stricken victims, dashed from the
place and ran down the road.
Lavari lost no time in telephoning to
the Seventeenth-street police station and
informing Captain Gillin of the bloody _
hold-up. Gillin. accompanied by Detec
tives Fitzgerald and Graham, immediately
repaired to the scene and proceeded to
make an investigation.
Shortly after they had left the station
the proprietor of the store telephoned that
the robbers had boarded an electric car
bound for this city. The sergeant at the
Seventeenth-street station immediately
dispatched two officers to watch the in
coming cars. Just as they reached* Twen
ty-sixth street they saw a man seated on
the dummy of a passing car with his
clothes covered with dust. Suspecting |
that he was one of the robbers, the police- j .
men hailed the car and. drawing their re
volvers, ordered the suspect.to surrender.
He feebly replied that he was shot and
was on his way to seek medical assist
ance. The man was Ravino. He was
bleeding profusely from the wounds In
flicted by the robbers and begged the
officers to assist him to the City and
County Hospital. lie was taken to the
Seventeenth-street station, where he was
placed in the ' patrol wagon and rapidly
driven to the hospital. "
The doctors found that the wound In his
chest Is extremely dangerous. They
think that the bullet ranged upward end
lodged in a vital part. .**â¢
The wounded man, in giving his version
of the hold-up, said that he was convers
ing with Lavari and his wife when the
two masked robbers entered the Etore.
"They immediately started to shoot," he
said, "and thinking that they intended to
kill us I seized the nearest desperado and
attempted to take his revolver from' him.
He shouted to hls .companion to help him,
and as I had him up against the wall his
accomplice fired three shots at me. The
third bullet struck me in the chest, and
as I was about to fall to the floor he
struck me over the head with his pistol,
rendering me unconscious. When I re
gained my senses a short time afterward
they had disappeared, and I concluded to
seek medical attention. My clothes were
covered with dust, and I presume that
the vigilant policemen, thinking I wa__ one
of the robbers, started to arrest me. After
I explained to them that I was mortally
wounded by resisting the attack ' of the
desperate men they had me conveyed to
the City and County Hospital."

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, JULY 18, 1899.
nal was given to me when I came ln. I stopped
to take water. I knew there was a special
following. When I stopped I sent my rear
brakeman back with a red light to flag the
extra. I Judge the special was running at a
high rate of speed. I had the tail lights out
on the rear of the train. I heard first the
crossing whistle; th^n I heard one long
whistle, and then I heard two short whistles,
which I supposed was an answer to my flag.
In reply to District Attorney Walthall.
the witness could not tel.l from his or
ders when tne special would overtake
him. He expected the special to stop and
take the sidetrack at Newman.
Questionâ duty is It to open the
switch?
Answerâ lt Is not anybody's duty. It may
fall on either train. 1 told my brakeman be
fore we got here to permit the extra to pass
on the sidetrack. It was unsafe to throw the
switch for a train coming Jat the speed the
special was moving. It was running faster than
thirty miles an hour. The flagman got back as
far as he couldâ l think about as far as the
switch. The signal lights should have been
seen a mile.
G. F. Swart, a brakeman on the freight
train, was called. He said:
I started right back to flag the special as
soon as I got in. I signaled right across the
track and kept going toward it and swinging
the light. They answered with two blasts of
the whistle. They were going thirty-flve miles
an hour when the engine passed me. â¢ The
switch was about 400 feet from the rear of my
train. I hopped off the track Just at the switch
and the special went by. I had no time to
throw the switch.
A. P. Allen, engineer of the special, tes
tified that he had been working for the
Southern Pacific since ISSS.- Said he:
I- have been working in the shops and run
ning extras. We left Sacramento at 11:07 p. m.
and arrived here at 2:3S a. m. I had orders to |
pass '-'47 when overtaken: had no orders to pass â 
at any point. I understand that the freight |
could stop here or go on. At the whistling post j
a half mile out I saw the first signal. I was ;
running thirty-five miles an hour. I saw the j
semaphore white. I expected lt red. as I
thought there would be orders. I whistled and
he gave me red and changed to white. After
I got the board white I did not expect to stop.
The order allows me to close up within the
ten minutes, or I never could pass them. After
I eot the semaphore white I started to go
through.
| Then I got a violent signal to stopâ a lantern
signal across the track. I was then only eight
j car lengths from the freight. I applied the
air, opened the sandbox and started to reverse
the' engine. The semaphore light I saw dis
tinctly, but the lights on the rear of the freight
! were so dim that I could not see them. The
I semaphore indicated to me that there was no
: train on the track. The night was clear.
After getting signals that there were no or
ders I did not expect to stop. If I had not re
: ceived the clear board I would have kept slow-
I ing down. -fy
To Coronerâ To the best of my knowledge, I
i was going twenty miles an hour when I met j
tiie flagman. I was awake to the fact that
the train was four minutes ahead of me. When
I saw the red light on the semaphore I was
about to stop. Then the white was shown,
which told me that the track was clear.
To Juror Crowâ l would have stopped If the
red signal had been shown. The signals de
ceived me. The change from red to white
shows a clear board.
i J. S. Fassett, conductor of the special,
testified that he Had been In the Southern
Pacific service since 1888. He was on the
â â  train when the collision occurred. He
said :
The orders to pass a train give me a right to
close up on the train ahead. It ls useless to
close ln at any other point than a station." The
engineer had- the same orders that I had. We
figured on catching the freight at Newman,
I and that it would be held. The semaphore
: signal is not a protection signal. It is to keep
i trains ten minutes apart. I intended to stop
here to ask for orders.
Brakeman Swart was called and testi
; fied that he swung a red lantern to warn
the special. The freight, when it came
In stopped at the water tank and did not
: move until struck by the special. A bag
gage car instead of a caboose was at the
rear of the freight. Just as the freight
stopped he got off and ran back as far as j
he could. Four minutes after the freight
arrived the special struck.
The District Attorney questioned the \
witness as to what he was doing during
the four minutes, as it took only two j
minutes to run back.
S. W. Crelgh, fireman of the special,
testified that he was on the engine when
the collision occurred.
"We slowed down considerably coming
I Into Newman," said he. "The engineer
said nothing to me. I did not attempt to
get off. We were going fifteen or twenty
miles an hour. I was not hurt."
Responding to pointed questions by the
â  District Attorney, the fireman admitted
that he had been interviewed by Superin
tendent Agler and Assistant Superintend
ent Thompson since the disaster. He was
still in the service of the company and
i nothing was said by them regarding his
i future services.
"I have no knowledge that the company
has fixed the blame on any one," he de
clared.
It was disclosed in the preceding testi
mony that Engineer Allen jumped before
the crash came.
Robert Aiken, engineer of the freight,
testified:
We looked back and saw the special coming.
We were taking water. I had a heavy train
of thirty cars and could not get out of the
way.
Conductor Moffitt of the freight train
was recalled and testified that he walked
at a fair gait from his train to the tele
graph office.
F. J. Cavanaugh, brakeman on the
. freight, was on the tank taking water.
lie saw the semaphore at red and saw it
changed to white.
C. B. Nash, brakeman on the rear end of
the special, testified that he heard two
whistles in answer to a signal.
M. B. Mangon, brakeman on the special,
testified that he saw a brakeman with a
white light near the wreck.
Deputy Coroner Bowker advised the
! jurors to consider all the facts, and If
they found that the disaster was due to
negligence or carelessness upon the part
of the Southern Pacific or Its employes lt
j was their duty to so report In the ver
dict. The room was then cleared and the
j jury began its deliberations.

features.
Early this morning Captain Gillin had
all his available men searching In the
vicinity of the hold-up for a trace of the
robbers. It Is believed, however, that Im
mediately after, the shooting they boarded
a car and came to this city. The ser
vices of several detectives at the Central
Station were also enlisted, with Instruc
tions to .do all in their power to appre
hend the murderous pair.
â  Lavari describes the man who shot Ra
vino as being about 5 feet 10 Inches in
height' and weighing about 180 pounds.
His companion was a trifle shorter and
did not appear to be quite as heavy. In
case they are arrested he says he will not
be able to Identify them.
There ls a suspicion among the police
that the men had carefully planned the
hold-up and expected to make a big haul.
Their object In firing into the celling when
they entered was to intimidate the pro

Trouble Between the Philpots and
Griffins Leads Up to a Fierce
Encounter.
â â
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOUISVILLE, Ky.. July 17.â A
special to the Courier-Journal from
London. Ky., tells of a report reaching
there of the outbreak of another feud
in Clay County, by which five men lost
their lives to-day. The dead are said
to be
ROBERT PHILPOT.
ED FISHER.
AARON MORRIS.
JIM GRIFFIN.
HUGH GRIFFIN.
These fatalities resulted from a i
pitched battle fought near Little Goose
Creek, three miles from Manchester.
The feud dates back nearly two j
years. On Christmas, 1897, James H. j
Philpot was killed by Aaron Morris, j
but before he died he shot and killed j
William Bundy, a friend of Morris, j
The Morrises and Griffins are closely I
affiliated. Since then the two factions I
have been very bitter, and the enmity- J
has been aroused recently by the |
White-Baker hostilities, The Philpots, j
| who are the strongest faction in the ;
mountains and number about 750 ;
voters, openly espoused the cause of j
! ,the Bakers, while the Griffins took
sides with the Whites.
The story that reaches here from I
1 Manchester. is that Bob Philpot was ar- !
: rested this morning by Deputy Sheriff
! Wash Thacker. While very circum
stantial in other respects the report
| does not show clearly the origin of the
' trouble nor give the reason for Phil
j pot's arrest. It is said that while
Thacker was taking-"Philpot's bond the
latter was shot from behind by a mem
ber of a crowd that had gathered. This
precipitated a general fight with Win
chesters and revolvers, which was
participated in by George Gran-
I ville, Robert and Peter Philpot and
Ed Fisher on one side and Aaron
Morris and Hugh, Jim and Green :
Griffin on the other. The battle began i
at about 9 o'clock and raged fiercely for :
ten or fifteen minutes. When it was I
over it was found that the five men- j
tioned had been killed outright. Three
of the belligerents were _ seriously
wounded, while Pete Philpot was the i
only one on either side to escape injury. I
Granville Philpot is said to be one of
the most seriously wounded. He is a
Union- veteran, having lost a leg at
Stone River. He is an ex-member of
the Kentucky Legislature, and is said
to have killed three or four men. Ed
Fisher, who is reported dead, was an- i
other man with several nicks in his
gun. He was but 23 years old. but was j
said to have killed three men.
The story of this battle caused con- !
sternation here, notwithstanding the !
fact that serious trouble has been ex
-1 pected to break out among the moun
| taineers of Clay County ever since the i
assassination of Tom Baker several ;
| weeks ago.
An effort was at once begun to secure
deputies to go to the seat of the trou
ble and attempt to restore quiet, but
up to a late hour In the afternoon there
had not been enough responses to ;
make up a force that would com
mand respect. The situation at Man
! Chester is deplorable. -Since morning
I the place has been In it state of terror,
i scarcely any one dariry: to venture out
;of doors. Business T* suspended and
the residents are momentarily expect- i
ing a renewal of hostilities.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
COVELO. July 17.â Excitement is
running high throughout Round Valley
to-night and fears are entertained that
another war of factions is about to
break out. Authoritative reports have
reached here that Sheriff Bergen of
Trinity County is now on a still hunt
not twenty miles away from Covelo,
and that numerous arrests are to be
made in connection with the Littlefleld
lynching of several years ago.
These reports were substantiated to
day, when Augustus Zaccarini, a busi
ness man- of Round Valley, returned
from a hunting trip twenty miles north
of here, just over the Trinity line. Mr.
Zaccarini brings news of the compul
sory retraction of a statement made by
a witness in the lynching case.' Frank
Doolittle and Walter Clark, two half
breed Indians, were the chief witnesses
against Joseph Gregory when he was
convicted of complicity in the Little
fleld lynching. Gregory is now serv
ing a twenty-year sentence in San
Quentin. Zaccarini says a man named
M. J. Brophy and two others, whose
names are unknown, were spending a
few days hunting and fishing on Red
Mountain Creek, near the .Doolittle
homestead, ostensibly for an outing.
They made numerous visits to the
Doolittle household, making purchases
of milk and eggs, and. in this way es
tablished an acquaintance. ,
On Saturday last Brophy urged Frank
Doollttle to join them and act as guide
to their party .as far north as Mad
River, and offering to reimburse him
liberally for the trip. Doollttle accepted,
and they arrived at a desirable camping
ground on the north side or the moun
tain, near Mad River, at 6 o'clock.
While Doollttle was engaged with the
duties about camp the conspirators
withdrew a short distance from camp
and separated, each approaching the
camp from different points.
When Brophy was within a few feet
of Doollttle he presented a loaded pis
tol and demanded that Doolittle attach
his signature to a retraction of all his
testimony offered in the case wherein
Gregory-was convicted. Doolittle , ex
claimed ' that " he could ; not 7do \ such a
thing and be a man. Brophy cocked his
1 revolver and prepared to Are. Then

AUTOMOBILE MAKES SOME
RAPID TIME.
RUNS FROM ALBANY TO AMSTERDAM.
ALBANY, July 17.â Fair skies
favored the transcontinental
automobile party to-day, and
the start westward this after
noon was made under the most encour
aging auspices. All through the morn
ing an interested crowd of business
men, manufacturers, bicyclists and oth
ers surrounded the carriage and kept
the machinist busy answering questions
about its mechanism.
A large number of electric carriages
are in course of construction here, and
their advocates were greatly interested
in the makeup and working of the auto
mobile. The opinion was freely ven
tured that American inventors would
soon outstrip all others in this line of
work, and the belief was apparently
strong that Mr. Davis would cross the
continent without either serious trouble
or inconvenience.
"An automobile that can get the bet
ter of the mud road between here and
Hudson can do anything," said an ex
perienced stage driver who dropped in
to watch preparations for the start.
"This carriage will just fly when it hits
a boulevard." t
The automobile did fly, as predicted,
although Mr. Davis made no effort to
get a speed record, as did the Hinton
party on its way here, and was satis
j fled to run along at a medium gait
| which would land him at Amsterdam
lin the early evening. The start was
made from the Hotel Teneyck at ex
actly 3 o'clock in the presence of a
cheering throng that was thoroughly
representative of the Capital City.
"Good luck!" they shouted, and Mrs.
! Davis waved her hand in reply as the
I automobile sped around the corner into
1 State street and began the serious
; business of climbing a heavy grade.
ing the document over quickly he noted
that it was as much a death warrant
as a confession of perjured testimony.
The retraction opened with a confes
sion that Doollttle had sworn the life
of Joe Gregory away and that remorse
was guiding him to self-destruction.
He takes leave of his family affection
ately, asks that they take his last word
in life and believe his confession, and
when they read it he would no longer
be living. Any search for his body
would be useless. .'.H 'yfy.
After the signing of the confession
the conspirators bound him hand and
foot and placed him among the camping
traps near a- clump of pines. Leaving
him thus, they withdrew some distance
and engaged in earnest conversation.
Doollttle, making up his mind that
death was coming soon, looked quickly
about for some means of escaping. He
felt close to his hands, which were
lashed behind his back, the camp
hatchet. He succeeded in working it in
such a way with his pinioned hands
that he severed one of the cords, free
ing one hand, and soon liberated him
self. Then began a wild race for life,
in which he outstripped the assassins.
Brophy is a relative of Gregory's
father and undoubtedly is an instru
ment in the hands of interested persons
who are seeking Gregory's pardon. Doo
llttle is en route to Weaverville, the
county seat of Trinity County, to con
sult with the authorities there.

CLEVELAND, Ohio, July 17.â The
inauguration of a second strike by the
employes of the big Consolidated Rail
way Company was a complete surprise
to the public this morning, and nearly j

BEST RUN OF
THE JOURNEY
BY JOHN D. DAVIS.
AMSTERDAM, N. V., July 17.â
We have made the best run of the
journey to-day, so far as the
working of the motor is concerned.
We started late from Albany, as
Mrs. Davis was thoroughly fa
tigued. We ran most of the time
at from twelve to fifteen miles an
hour, but at times when we struck
a fine piece of road I let out the
speed up to twenty-seven miles an
hour. People were out in every
farmhouse and hamlet.
While entering Amsterdam- it
looked as If a circus, had struck
town. The roads have been ex
cel'eirl at times, especially when
approaching Schenectady, where
we found the surface as smooth as
a floor for six miles. Between
Schenectady and Amsterdam the
road was fair, with an occasional
poor stretch, and then a good one.
The carriage ran as steadily as an Em
pire State express locomotive and went
by the capitol amid the applause of
many spectators. The granite pave
ment of Washington avenue was speed
ily passed and the viaduct crossed : that
leads to the smooth brick-paved thor
oughfare opening on the handsome
boulevard.
Over this fine macadam road the au
tomobile did its best work, and medium
speed was reached at 4:20 o'clock. Mr.
Davis took the precaution to have du
plicates of all the uncertain pieces of
mechanism made while here, and the
automobile, party will not suffer from
any more long delays if a nut should
jar off or a pin give out on the trip.
A bulletin received here this evening
announced the safe arrival of the au
tomobile at Amsterdam at 6:45 o'clock.
The party will remain there over night.
AMSTERDAM, N. V., July 17.âAu
tomobilist Davis reached Amsterdam at
6:45 o'clock this evening from Albany.
Leaving Albany at 2 o'clock over the
boulevard the touring cart was paced
by a large number of bicyclers, many of
whom tired after a few mfnutes and
dropped back, while others kept in the
van for several miles, and the machine
over the finely macadamized road at
tained a speed of twenty-seven miles
an hour. Some of the pacemakers led
Mr. Davis astray by taking him on to
Lathams Corners, and the error was
not discovered until two and a half
miles had been traversed. The auto
mobile was at once turned about and
soon regained the lost road, but this
little slip caused a delay of twenty-five
minutes.
Mr. and Mrs. Davis took luncheon at
a farmhouse, occupying forty min
utes. They were also delayed a like
period, forty minutes, by a heated pis
ton. Coming down Union street, Sche
nectady, which is asphalted, a speed of
the company was not living up to the
agreement. Several conferences were
held, the latest about a week ago, and it
was then announced that everything
was satisfactory or would be as soon
as the company had been given ample
time to adjust schedules and arrange
the runs. The presence on cars of the j
non-union men who were retained after
the settlement of the strike was still
a bone of contention, however, and a
crisis was reached yesterday, when, as
claimed, a number of union men were
discharged for refusing to go out on
cars with non-union men.
A meeting followed last night, and at
3 o'clock this morning the decision to
strike was reached. All the lines were
tied up from 5 o'clock until after 8,
when the operation of the Euclid ave
nue line with non-union men under po
lice protection was undertaken. Cars
were run at five-minute intervals on
that line until evening, but no attempt
was made to move cars on other lines.
Henry A. Everett, president of the
company, issued a statement this even
ing in which he said the terms of the
agreement with the strikers had been
strictly adhered to, but that it Was im
possible to inaugurate all the reforms
promptly because of the continued in
terference with the non-union crews,
and he holds the union men directly
responsible for this. He attributes the
present strike to a feeling of disap
pointment on the part of the unioc men
because the non-union men have not
been mobbed and beaten out of the
company's service. He says that he
will operate the cars if he is given
police "protection. Protection has been
promised by Mayor Farley, and it is
said that the militia will be called out
if the. police are unable to preserve
order.
There has been little disorder to-day,
and nothing of a serious nature.
STRIKE OF DECKHANDS
ON UP-RIVER STEAMERS
I Men Demand an Increase of Salary
and Shorter Hours of
" Labor. . y,
SACRAMENTO, July 17.â deck
hands on the up-river steamers Red
Bluff, Jacinto and Varuna, belonging
to . the Sacramento Transportation
Company, struck last night for higher
wages. They had been receiving $40 a
month and board and now" want $50 a
month. They claim that their hours of
labor are too long. As a result of the
strike those steamers are laid up. The
company's agent here says he will be
able to "secure other men to take the
places of the strikers. The strikers
thus far have been quiet and orderly
and this morning were paid off. The
steamer Dover is expected to arrive
from up the river to-day and It is be
lieved that the strikers will attempt to
Induce the deckhands of that vessel to
join them in their demand for increased
wages.
There is also trouble on the Southern
Pacific sjteamer Apache, which is
moored to a wharf below, this city on
account of the low water. The deck
hands would have quit last night, but
were induced to remain over until this
morning. Some of them have already
left and the outcome is a matter of con
jecture. The men have not made a de
mand for any definite increase in
.wages, j their principal cause ,of com
plaint being that they are overworked.
The Apache will be able to leave for
San Francisco with the men who re
mained at work. .
Besides the steamers tied up when the
'' strike was declared, two others of the

twenty- two and a half miles an hour
was reached. When about two miles
out of Amsterdam the piston again be
came heated, necessitating a stop of
fifteen minutes. It. was given a touch
of oil, which was allowed to gum, and
then the journey T *>'as resumed. One
of the Albany pacemakers accompanied
the carriage twenty miles. The exact
running time from Albany here, thirty
three miles, was two and three-quarter
hours. .
The, automobile is running nicely now,
there having been no mishaps to-day.
The report from Albany that there was
an accident to the brake was untrue.
Mr. and Mrs. Davis will leave Am
sterdam at 5 o'clock Tuesday morning
and will go to Utica, some sixty miles,
before night. Both are feeling well.
Mr. Davis is a trifle stiff from his re
cent fall and constant operation of the
carriage.
CHARRON LEADING IN THE
TOUR OF FRANCE RACE
PARIS, July 17.â Charron Is leading
in the "tour de France" automobile
race. M. Controle yesterday was at the
little town of Amberielle-En-Bugey.
Le Matin's correspondent telegraphs:
"Charron having reached Lons de Saul
nier at 17 minutes past 11, it was cal
culated he would arrive at 5 minutes
to 1. He dashed into Amberiem at full
speed at 12:53:32. The two front springs
of his automobile were broken, but he
repaired them at once, and amid the
applause of all started again for Aix
les-Balns, 75 kilometers (about 46*4
miles) further away. M. DeKnyff, who
had broken a spring, was obliged to
stop on the road and repair it, and ar
rived at 1:15:21, followed 7 minutes and
4 seconds later by M. Jamin. The first
motocycle to arrive was that of M.
Gleize at 1:44."
San Joaquin No. 2, have arrived and
their hands joined the strikers.
It was rumored late in the afternoon
that an attempt would be made to take
the Jacinto up the river with a crew
from Stockton, but if such was the in
tention it was reconsidered.
A barge belonging to the company
and loaded with sacks of grain stuck
in the middle of the river this after
noon and an offer of. It is said, four
cents a sack to transfer them to an
other barge found no takers.
The difference between the men on
the steamer Apache and its owners has,
it is said, been adjusted and the crew
returned to work. Theirs was not a
demand for more wages, but for
shorter hours.
The striking deckhands are having a
glorious time. The water front is lined
with drunken men and individual and
free fights are of common occurrence.
As yet nobody has been seriously in
jured. ; .- ,
Whether the strikers will gain their
point or whether they will return to
work on the old schedule can only be
surmised. The Queen of Yukon, a

HOLLOWAY WAS
SLAIN BY ONE OF
HIS COMRADES
American Marine Officers Ac=
cused of Cowardice at
Samoa.
VALLEJO, July 17.â According to a j
statement made by a member of the
marine guard that was stationed at
the United States Consulate at Apia
during the recent period of hostilities in
Samoa Private Holloway, one of the ma
rines, was not killed, as has been stated,
by a hostile Samoan during an attack
upon the consulate, but was. Instead, the
victim of an American bullet sent from
a gun In the hands of one of his own
comrades. Holloway's life, it is asserted,
probably never would have been sacrificed
had lt not been for the actions of the
commander of the guardâ Lieutenant C.
Morrast Perkinsâ who, without justifica
tion, constantly informed the men that
they were in imminent danger of annihila
tion. He caused them repeatedly to fire
in the dead of night at an Imaginary foe,
and had them worked up to such a ten
sion that their guns were continually
popping, and at nothing, as the hostile
Samoans kept at a safe distance and re
frained from making an attack during the
whole of the time the guard was on duty
at the consulate.
" "The general public has very little Idea
of the events that really took place." said
The Call correspondent's informant to
day, "while the marine guard was ashore
during the greater part of March and
the whole of last April. On several oc
casions recently articles have appeared in
the San Francisco papers praising the
marines for their bravery In defending
the American consulate. It was stated
that they were attacked night after night
by hundreds of leaf-crowned warriors,
who, in every instance, were driven back
by their steady and well-aimed fire. Listen
to the facts: The consulate building is
about seventy-two feet square, raised
some four feet from the ground, and is
made of wood, with an Iron roof. Three
sides of the building were lined with ma
rines, who were protected by breastworks
of bags of sand. In addition to the latter
native mats, and, in front of the com
mander of the marines, knapsacks were
heaped up to the veranda rail. Outside
the building were three guns placed to
sweep every approach. Beyond these and
Inclosing the house and grounds was a
five-foot barbwire fence of five rows. Out
side this again, on the east, south and
west sides of the fence, were row upon
row of barbwire stretched ankle high
above the ground. From this it will be
seen that every precaution was taken to
make an attack difficult of execution.
"During the occupation of the consulate
by the marines hundreds of rounds of
ammunition were fired. People will
naturally ask how the little garrison
fared. Well, only two shots hit the build
ing all the time the marines were there.
"One was a six-inch shell fired from tne
Philadelphia when the town, was first -
bombarded, and which caused the wound
that resulted in the death of Private
Mudge. and the other shot was a stray
one that came from the British consulate. :
There was not another mark on the build
ing where a bullet entered it from the
outside. There were, however, several
holes made by bullets sped from within
the building. From the veranda rail
through the floor and roof daylight
showed where, in the hurry of firing,
pieces that should have been pointed at
the Samoans had missed the mark.
"As only two shots struck the building
one would naturally Inquire, What about
the 'terrible white sharpshooter' who an
noyed the Americana so much, and who
killed Private Holloway? The sharp
shooter was a myth and consequently
.never shot poor Holloway. The. question
then arises. How was this marine killed?
I will tell you how he met his death, and
there are many others aboard the Phila
delphia who are able to tell you the same i
story. , _ _ , i
"On a rainy night Holloway relieved Pri
vate Myers at 10 o'clock at post No. 1,
which was outside the building but inside
the wire fence. Firing had been going on |
from the building since 9 o'clock, and I
every one's nerves were in a high state of
tension. No one had slept for forty hours, i
Holloway was leaning against the front ,
steps, with his waterproof coat wrapped
around him. At 10:30 o'clock one of the
corporals obtained permission to go under
the house with a light to search for the
enemy, who, he declared, were hiding
there. After a very exhaustive search,
with a revolver at full cock in one hand I
and a lantern in the other, he returned j
to the veranda, reported that he could j
find no one and resumed his station.
"Suddenly, after a short time, he jumped
up, calling out. 'There they are!' and be
pan to fire out of the front veranda.
Several others near him heard Holloway
cry 'Oh, my God!* and fall. When picked
up it was found that his rubber coat had
been scorched. The bullet entered at the
top of the left shoulder and passed in a
slanting direction downward into the body
but not through it. Holloway was not
relieved from that post. He was the last
sentry to walk No. 1 after nightfall. Pri
vate Myers could tell the state of his
feelings while he was at the same post,
' with bullets from his own comrades whis
tling past him as he lay on the ground
trying to dig a hole for himself.
"The next morning at sun up a signal
was hoisted with the following words.
'Send boat for insane and dead. A boat
IDENTIFIED AS
CHEYE`S SLAYER
Several Witnesses Tes
tify Against Corcoran.
_
â â â¦ â
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WALLACE, Idaho, July 17.â The prose
cutors in the Corcoran case have evident
ly finished their proofs of conspiracy. To
day they brought forward a new line of
testimony tending to bring the murder
of Cheyne directly home to the defendant.
They began with Frank Culbertson, the
manager of the Tiger-Poorman Company,
whose mill Is located at Burke. This wit
ness related how he had made arrange
ments to leave for the East on the morn
ing of April 29. Arising unusually early
that morning he found but few of his
men had gone to work. He went to the
Miners' Union hall, where he found a
meeting In progress. At his request the
defendant was called out from the meet
ing and informed the manager that the
boys were going to Wardner, but would
return in time to go to work on the night
shift. " -;y
Then came A. M. St. Clair, a teamster,
Vho testified that he saw Corcoran on top
of a boxcar as the train left Burke and
again as It returned. The witness said the
defendant was neither armed nor masked.
Another teamster claimed to have seen
Corcoran on the streets of Burke between
9 and 10 o'clock of the day of the riot car
rying a rifle.
Then came the star witness for the
State, for whose appearance every one
had been waiting since the trial began.
She was Mrs. Ida J. Sinclair of Wardner.
The recital Of her testimony was Intensely
dramatic and was listened to with breath
less interest throughout. Her home is Just
across the street from where the "bull
pen" now stands. She saw the train com
ing in on that dreadful day of murder and
arson. She saw Cheyne made a prisoner
by the mob, and went to where he. Huff
and Rogers were and tried to speak to
Huff. She was told to go away, and re
treated across a vacant lot. She told of
the slapping of Cbejrne*e face, of the or
der to run and the subsequent shooting.
After Cheyne had gone a short, distance
he disappeared from her view, and believ
ing he had been hit she ran down to the
spot where she had. last seen him. He
was attempting to rise as she reached his
came and took off Hollnway's body and
the corporal to the flagship.
"All the while the marines were at th<^
consulate neither by word nor by deed did"
the marine officer, Lieutenant Perkins,
endeavor to encourage the men, but his
whole conduct tended in every way to dis
hearten them. At night he would crawl
around the veranda and behave In any
thing but a soldierly manner. Many in
stances of his cowardice could be given,
but the following will suffice:
"On March 31 a scouting party of twenty
men under the marine officer and the
junior medical officer made a reconnois
sance to ascertain If the enemy were in
force. The little party proceeded with a
Colt's automatic gun about three miles
along the beach, where the automatic gun
was placed ready for action, and as a
rallying point, with four marines in charge.
The remainder of the party, led by the
young doctor, proceeded along the beach
and was fired upon. The enemy's fire
was returned and then the little force re
treated to the gun, the marine officer
being an easy first there. After all had
arrived a retreat was ordered to the con
sulate.
"On the following day the marine offi
cer, who all the time in moving about as
sumed a crouching position, deliberately
drove a private away from a cocoanut
tree behind which he was standing- and
firing because, as the commander said,
it did not afford sufficient cover for both,
and he was the one who, of course, must
have protection. The private made no
secret of this.
"Again, before the assembly had been
sounded the third time, and before the
British recall was given, the marine of
ficer was hurrying to the rear and making
for the beach as fast as his long legs
could carry him. Following close behind
him was another brave "marine. Sergeant
Forsterer, who arrived at the beach just
after him. This sergeant was recom
mended by the commander for gallantly <
keeping his position with his men until
surrounded, and only then retreating to
the beach. During the whole of the fight
Forsterer, although armed with a rifle and ,
revolver and 200 rounds of ammunition,
never fired a shot. This is true also of
the marine officer, as the revolver of the
latter was perfectly clean when he re
turned.
"The sergeant did, however, fire a shot
on the Ist of April, but some time after
the marines reached the consulate. He
saw a poor horse straying outside the wire
fence, walked up to It and shot the ani
mal with his revolver. This was the only
life he took while he was at the consulate,
although the mighty report of his rifle
kept the rest of the guard on tenterhooks
of expectation.
"The wounding of a member of the
guard by a "drunken private was the last
straw,- and the force was promptly with
drawn to the ship in disgrace. The cen
sure delivered to the commander by the
captain' of the Philadelphia on the quar
terdeck was most severe, and richly was
it deserved. If the captain had known all
the facts he would not have stopped at a
censure.
'"With all this behavior and the con
stantly recurring acts of fear on the part
of the marine officer, the guard every day,
morning and afternoon. In the blazing Sa
rriban sun. fell in for physical drill, bayo
net exercise and extended order move
ments, such as retiring by double time,
etc. The exercises were performed in
blouses and leggings, and every one had
to carry ISO rounds of ammunition. Aii
this was extremely exhausting. In view
of the nightly nervous excitement to
which the men were subjected the com
mander of the guard should have permit
ted the men to rest instead of putting
them through the unnecessary exercises.
"Do you wonder why the marines feel
so bitter against Lieutenant Perkins?
i They all roundly denounce him for his
I treatment and ridicule his self-glorifica
! tion in the articles on the battle of April
1 contributed by him to the Bulletin and
the Examiner. They do not mince words
in charging him with incompetency and j
cowardice. In this connection I have
heard that United States Consul Osborn !
remarked after declaring the commander
of the marines to be an unwelcome per- I
sonage around the consulate:
"'1 don't know what Captain White of
the Philadelphia meant by sending such
an incompetent man here, and I would
indeed be glad if he and his men were
back on the ship.'
"Seventy-five per cent of the original
marine guard of the Philadelphia have
deserted up to the present time. At every
port at which the flagship has touched
men have applied for transfer to other
vesels or marine barracks. Some of these
have been veterans. The desertions com- :
menced when the ship went to Honolulu
last August to raise the flag. More de
sertions occurred when the vessel came
back to San Francisco, and others took
place in Costa Rican waters. While the
Philadelphia was at Apia some of the men
were transferred to the Badger. There
were several applications for each place,
and the action of the men occasioned sur
prise among the ship's officers, as the
Philadelphia was about to return to San
Francisco and it was known that the
! Badger was to remain in Samoan waters
for an indefinite period. It was well
known, however, among the crew that the
marines had wearied of their command
er's treatment and were anxious to avoid
any more of it in the future. I can as
sure you that we have but little respect
for the marine officer, and his recent con
tributions to the press are the butt of
i dally ridicule."
Bide, hut could not stand alone. She j
begged the masked men to spare his life ,
and called for assistance to remove him
to a place where medical attention could i
be obtained. Cheyne also joined In the en- !
treaty for his lire, and said he had not j
been given a fair show. After much per
suasion two men separated from the main '
body and helped the witness carry the
wounded man to the back room of a sa
loon near by.
"Did you recognize any of those men?"
asked Acting Prosecuting Attorney For
ney. 7-'<...
"I did," replied the witness in a low )
tone.
"You may tell the jury who he was."
"Paul Corcoran," came the answer, and
a deep sigh went up from the audience.
Mrs. Sinclair further said that Corcoran
was masked and carried a rifle, but that
his mask was a flimsy, home-made affair
and concealed only a portion of his face,
so that she readily recognized him.
The defense attempted on cross-exami
nation to discredit the witness' testimony
by showing she had never seen Corcoran
but once prior to the 29th. This she ad
mitted, but refused to admit she might
be mistaken. Another point the defense
is laying great stress upon Is that Mrs.
Sinclair, tiff. Colburn and his wife are
all related. The prosecution will probably
finish to-morrow.
PRESIDENT TOLD OF

WASHINGTON. July 17.â President Mc-

of Idaho, accompanied by Edward Boyceof
Butte, Mont., president of the Western Fed
eration of Miners, and W. R. Ooldensmlth,
secretary of the local miners' union at
Wardner/ Idaho. The last named gentle
men are a committee representing the
miners lately engaged in the strike at
Wardner which resulted ln the calling out
of troops under General Merrlam at the
; request of the Governor of Idaho. The
Interview with the President lasted some
time and the entire situation was thor
oughly discussed. The committee In
formed the President that the presence of
the troops had been represented In a false
light and: added that In their own opinion
the Federal authorities were being used in
an illegitimate manner. The President
told the committee that the troops had
been sent only on the request of the Gov
ernor and were there for no other reason,
than to preserve peace. After the inter
view both members of the committee ex
pressed themselves as entirely satisfied
with the attitude of the administration,
which they said had been misrepresented
by the local authorities.

EAST LAS VEGAS. N. M., July 17.â
Word was received here late to-day that
the body of one of the train robbers
concerned in the Folsom train robbery on
the Colorado Southern Railroad had been
conveyed to Cimarron, N. M., from the
scene of the fight and was afterward tak
en to Springer, a railroad station, where
an inquest was held to-night. The slain
I robber was known by the name of Wil
liam McGinnls, alias G. W. Franks, and
came from Magdalena, N. M., where he
was known as a bronco buster. He was
6 feet 2 Inches tall and weighed about 200
| pounds. -7
The other two robbers abandoned their
horses and are being pursued in the hills
by a posse of twenty men. â  -V
Later accounts of the fight state that
the train robbers were overtaken at about
5 o'clock Sunday evening in the canyon
ten miles above Cimarron. They were
preparing to go into camp and replied in
the negative to a demand to surrender, a
flght then ensued In which about fifty
shots were exchanged. Sheriff Ed l'arr
received the first wound through the
: wrist, but bandaged it and renewed the
battle. He was shot a second time
! through the body and fell dead. F. H.
! Smith, another member of the posse, was
j shot through the leg. H. N. Love sus
i tamed a dangerous wound through- the
thigh. The firing lasted about forty-five
minutes.
Special Officer Reno remained on the
; scene until 8 o'clock Sunday night and
I then left for Cimarron to get medical aid,
! which was secured at Springer. It took
him nearly four hours to make the trip
'to Cimarron, a distance of ten miles,
j through the heavy rain and intense dark
ness. The attacking party consisted of
; Sheriff Farr, Special Officer W. H. Reno
' of Denver, F. H. Smith of New York,

of the, Bourne & Hershey warehouse a
blank receipt together with one previously
issued by Gastelger to Mrs. E. C. Lauge
nour In which a mistake in the amount
occurred. He claimed that he was sent
by Mr. Hershey to have the mistake cor
rected. By accident or design he spilled
the ink he took with him. but managed
to save -enough for Gastelger to sign the
name of his employers. He. tore up the
original receipt and requested Burk to
have Mr. Watkins . fill out a new one.
Burk filled in the "receipt himself, sold it
to Robert Nethercott and with the pro
oeeds left the country. , All efforts to find
him were unavailing.
A man answering the description was
arrested â in Stockton and brought to
Woodland. It proved to be a case of
mistaken identity and he was released.
The officers here are in doubt as to
whether Burtt is really Burk or the man
arrested in Stockton under the mistaken
supposition that he was Burk.

AND THE BABY DIED
MRS. LIZZIE McKNTgg of 521 Elizabeth street, a frail looking little
woman, clad In deep mourning, sobbed as though . her heart would
break when she told the Coroners jury yesterday morning how she
had accidentally poisoned her two-months-old baby, little Jimmie.
Her cup of sorrow wis 7- re than full, for within the last four
month* <=he lost two children with pneumonia, and on Friday her
third and last was taken away from her because the law allows poison to
be placed in bottles of the same shape and bearing the same colored labels
as those bearing harmless prescriptions. t^-.a^
Her baby was sick with bronchial trouble, and she sot from the Pacific
I>ierie-Â«ary at jjgg MiÂ«cjnn streets two small bottles of medicineâ one contain
ing medicine to* be" used internally and the other a prescription made up
large'y of c a rbo"c acid, to be inhaled by the baby. Both bottles were of
the same and size; both labels were white, both of the same size,
printed alike and not to be distinguished one from the other except by a
-arrow strip or" white paper pasted over the top of the label on the poison
bottle and bearir.s: the words, External Use Only."
Wearied by long watching and her nerves matron? by anxiety. Mrs. Me-
Entee mistook the carbolic acid bottle for that containing the medicine for
lr , t -.-. a * T Vj =c ' B-->th bottles stood together upon a little table, the back of the
bottle of poison beins turned ward her. In her hurry she neglected to look
'or the <=trip on the label and gave tf baby the poison.
â - In Borne other countries no more civilized than California poisons are re
quired by law to be soid in - . . ire bottles, so that a mistake need not be com
mitted in the dark or by a blind person. As a further nrecaution. poison
labels are red. with the skull, and cross-bones and the word "Poison" con
spicuously displayed.
The jury rendered a verdict of accidental death.

A large ----- critical audience filled
the California Theater last night to see
-_ Frawley Company in "The Dancing
GirL" What a pity there is a fourth
act. We wait for the third, save our
applause for it and discuss it when we
leave. The situation burns hot as
flame, and with a backward look we
see nothing else. The first act is a
prettier one by far, except for the ten
antry. One man could have carried on
the action and given us the situation
as well as all his neighbors, and then
the act would have been reminiscent
of nothing.
The part of Drusilla Ives Is a strong
one for Miss Bates, and she plays ie
well. After her excellent work in "The
Last Word.*, though, her performance
is something of a disappointment: she
does not seem exactly in sympathy with
the character, especially in the stronger
scenes, where she should excel. It
would be very difficult for any one to
act sympathetically with Mr. Harring
ton Reynolds, who plays the role of
John Christison. He gives .- such an
idea of goodness and religion that we
are not surprised to see Drusilla seek
ing sunshine in darker paths. Ke
seems to try to imitate Henry Killer,
and imitation- of any -"-nd is a fatal
mistake. Mr. Cook plays David Ives
with true intelligence, and what a
thankless task it must be to portray
a character whose religion makes him
as cold as a cave and unforgiving to
the last wrench. Miss Hope' Ross as
the lame girl was sweet and convincing,
but handicapped by her voice, which in
places should be as "tenderly sad as
tears in young eyes." Miss Mould's
personality seems to me more fitted to
the art.
Mr. Frawley was a true Duke of
Ouisebury, and If he would but articu
late distinctly we should have nothing
but words of praise. Mr. Hickman was
an older Alexander Airy, and whether
the author meant him to be that or not
we find the portrayal Interesting and
amusing. "The. Dancing Girl" is not a
play that holds our sympathy. We
come away in touch with no oneâ sorry
for no one. and with belief in no one's
repentance. It is not one of Mr. Jones'
happiest efforts and the Frawley Com
pany make it as interesting as the
lines and situations allow. The last
ac: makes it seem a lc-ng and tremen
dous effort without result.
CHARLOTTE THOMPSON.
TivolL
Another crowded house witnessed the
hurlesque of "Blue Beard" at the Tlvoll
last evenine. The bright songs and dances
which are presented in each act were in
almost every Instance repeated, so great
was the desire for encores. Next week
"Warg" will be presented, with Edwin
Stevens in the title role, and the week fol
lowing the grand opera season will be in
augurated. Special preparations are now
under way for the presentation on a grand
scale of "La Boheme," "The Jewess."
"Othello." "Queen of Sheba," "Lohen
grin." "Faust." "Carmen," etc., and the
Tivoli management is confident that the
grand opera season will eclipse anything
of the. kind they have ever undertaken.
Some of the principals are already here
and others arrived in New York on Sun
day from Europe and are now en route
to -'the coast. ______
Orpheum.
The. Orpheum was as usual crowded
last night and the bill presented was a
most attractive one. Among the new fea
tures Kilpatrirtc and Barber take the
lead. They style themselves scientific
trick bicyclists and they gave one of the
cleverest and most graceful exhibitions
en the wheel ever seen at this popular ]
pleasure resort. Individually they per- ;
form the most daring feats and together
on --.-. one wheel their tricks and feats |
are marvelous. They at once establish
themselves as prime favorites. Les
Browns, said to be the only one-legged
male and female acrobats and instrumen- >
i talists in the world, give a novel enter- j
i tainment. Houdim made his reappear
ance and offered to give the "professor"
who made an alleged expose of his hand
cuff trick $190 If he could extricate him- '
self with a key in his mouth. The hand
cuff and trunk tricks mystified the audi
ence as deeply as ever. Signor and Sig
nora de Pasqua.ll were heard in selections
from "Cavalleria Rusticana" and were
â *- irmly applauded. The ether attractions
were Minnie Palmer. Millian and Shields.
George Wilson and the Rixfords. Hayes
and Littel will appear to-night in "In
gomar," Hayes having recovered from
his attack of congestion of the lungs.
Grand Opera-House.
Audran's "Olivette" was the opening
attraction of the week at the Grand
Opera, and the well-filled house was kept
on the laugh during the whole perform
ance. The fun was furnished Ix unstinted
measure by William Wolff, who made a
new role out of uelicot by the bril
liant talk, rich with puns, which he in- â¢
terjected into his lines. Arthur Wooley
made a hit as Captain de Merrimac, and
Persse as his double in the second act was
commendable. Edith Mason-was as pretty*
and as piquant as ever as Olivette, and
Bertha Ri<- was the love-lorn Countess
to the life. Moustique is a small part for
Hattie Bell Ladd. but she filled it well.
The sailors' hornpipe gave Mindel Fern
------- an opportunity to show some
i graceful steps and -- lithe and graceful
! figure, both of which were applauded by
the spectators. ___
Columbia.
Nearly 300 Oregon boys enjoyed the hos
pitality of the Colombia management
last evening and added their generous ap
plause to that of the large audience who
enjoyed Carton's brilliant comedy, "Lord j
and Lady Algy." Repetition seems to
add to the zest of Miller's great com- '
pany, and the play last evening went
with even more swing and dash than
characterized the initial performance,
while there was still the same careful
attention to detail.
Miller's characterization of "Sporty
Lord Algy is a performance that is well
worth several visits, and the company i
score equally with the star. "Lord and \
Lady Algy" will be continued throughout
the week. Or. Monday next "Heartsease,"
the success of Mr. Miller's last season
here, will be staged.
Alcazar.
That old emotional standby, "The New
Magdalen." was revived at the Alcazar
last evening and drew a crowded house. ;
Miss Florence Roberts as Mercy Merrick
was well suited ln the pan of the repent- j
ant woman and won an enthusiastic recall
in the scene with Grace Roseberry. White
Whittlesey was very good as Julian Gray.
the clergyman, while Frank Denithorne
gave a careful rendering of the part of
Horace Holmcroft. Miss May Nanr.ary
was a little too vixenish in her portrayal
of Grace Roseberry, while Miss Marie
Howe made a graceful and lovable Lady
Janet Roy. "The New Magdalen" ought
to have a prosperous run.
Chutes and Zoo.
The new pill in the Chutes Theater last
night furnished some interesting numbers.
Especially funny was William McÃride in
his Celtic witticisms and songs. He sus- :
I tamed his reputation as an entertainer of
1 more than ordinary ability. The same
' can be said of Miss Le Clair, the female
gymnast. A! Hagard. the ventriloquist,
was quite amusing and the holdovers were
â up to their standard. Many of the Oregon
I soldiers were guests of the management. ;
Olympia.
Querlta Vincent last night began her '
farewell week at the Olympia and she re- j
ceived ouite an ovation. She was encored â 
until she had to refuse further responses. :
No better tribute to her talent can be re
corded than to say that she is a greater !
favorite with the public in this her twen
; ty-seventh week than on the opening. I
; The Seymour brothers scored well..

Society for the Prevention of Cruelty
to Animals Makes a Good Show
ing for the Past Year.
When the male njembers of the Society
for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals
assembled for their annual meeting yes
terday they were met with* a surprise in
the form of a large collection of flowers
on the table and a large collection of the
lady members ranged along the wall. To
the business men this signified that some
favor was to be asked of them, and they
were correct in their surmises. When the
proper time arrived the ladles stated that
they very* much desired the official In

hand for the raising of funds for the pur
chase of about 50,000 badges for the chil
dren members of the Bands of Mercy
which are being organized in the interest i
of humane treatment of the dumb ani
mals. There are now 13.300 in the bands.
If the society would take up the project
and father it by the use of the society
name the ladles would do the rest. It was
practically decided to give the required
indorsement, but formal action will be \

VALLEY ROAD CHANGES.
The Directors Will Meet To-Day in
Annual Meeting.
To-day the San Francisco and San Joa
quin Valley Railroad will hold its regular
annual meeting, at which Chief Engineer
Storey will present his report telling of
the work that has been accomplished
since the first shovelful of dirt was lifted
on July 5. 1_95.
Since that time Mr. Storey will show
that 305 miles of track have been laid and
three tunnels, one of which is 5600 feet in
length, have been practically completed.
On some of them there is still incidental
work, such as timbering and general
cleaning up. still to be done, but with the
exception of tunnels 1 and 4 the great un
, dertaking of getting daylight through
the hills has been accomplished. On these
two tunnels there are still several hun
dred feet to be bored. That portion of the
track south of Stockton has been laid
and is in working order, leaving only the

ATTORNEY RICKETT'S
CLOTHES DESERT HIM
AH. RICKETTS, the popular at
torney in the Claus Spreckels
. building, will in future take out
an insurance policy or. his per
sonal property when he visits in the
country. Either this or he will secure
the services of an "Eagle Eye" to
watch his clothes * while he sleeps.
Sunday, night he had an experience at
San Leandro in which his vest myste
riously absented itself from his room
while he slept; likewise his coat, white
shirt, pants, watch, coin, diamond
matchsafe and other property. The
garments hied themselves to a dust
bin in the basement of the house, but
th. remainder and more valuable of
his possessions decamped to parts un
known. _
Rioketts spent Sunday night in the
suburbs of San Leandro at the coun
try home of Mrs. Nellie Sanger, one
of his clients and widow of the late
Emil A. Sanger. It was his intention
to rise early enough to be present In
court in this city on the following
morning at 10 o'clock. The thought
that he might oversleep himself made
Ricketts fidgety- all bight and many
times he awakened and looked at his
watch, which hung in his vest. The last time he consulted the timepiece was
at 4:10 a. m. on Monday morning, after which he returned to the arms of
Morpheus-, Intending to remain therein for at least a couple of hours more.
Shortly after 7 o'clock he again opened his eyes and reached out for his
watch. His hands grasped air. By the light of the newborn sun of that Mon
day morning he searched every nook and corner of the room. His exterior gar
ments had disappeared. His socks,
shoes and cravat alone remained by
the side of the bed.
In his consternation he groped for
a messenger call to summon a hack.
He could curl up in the bottom of a
hack, he thought, and reach his home
in Oakland unseen. But, alas, there
are no messenger calls in San Lean
dro. After some study he figured that
his hostess was the perperator of a
huge joke of which he was the vic
tim. Wrapping a sheet around hfs
shivering form he rapped on the door
of her room and demanded that the
Joke be called off. After much parley.

up~ the clothes from the basement,
where ie says he found them in a dust

matchsafe, a large sum of money and
everything of value were missing from
the pockets.
The Japanese denies all knowledge
of the bold burglary and the matter
was placed in the hands of the police.
Ricketts proceeded to this city, "and
when seen pronounced it a mysterious
afifair from the fact that it was committed so late in the morning. In the
same room was a quantity of. silverware, and in the hall adjoining the at
torney's room was a sealskin sack, while about the house was much of value.
None of these things were touched and the thief. confined his operations to
the garments owned by the visitor. The police have the Japanese servant
under suspicion and will probably place him under arrest. Many circum
stances.in the case confirm this suspicion. ....

A great many people are interested in
the British ship Aristomene, now out six
ty days from Pisagua with a cargo of :
nitrate. Her charterers. W. R. Grace &
Co., are watching anxiously for her and ;
- have a berth secured and all arrange
ments made to begin discharging just as
soon as she can be docked. The California
Powder Works Is also watching anxiously
because they want the nitrate, and Uncle
Sam is keeping tab because he wants the ;
powder. An average passage is sixty
days, but it would not surprise anybody .
If it was another week before the Aristo
mene got ln, owing to the light winds and
calms reported by every vessel that
reaches port.
The demand for nitrate in the United
States has sent a number of vessels to the
west coast of South America, and the big
gest tonnage in years is now heading in j
this direction from the nitrate ports. Be- :
sides the Aristomene the American bark
entine Encore is now out twenty-five days,
British ship Dynomene twenty-four days,
American bark Highland Light eleven
days and the American schooner Louis,
American barkentine Gleaner, British
bark Auldgirth and British ship Sierra j
Blanca are loading.
There was some tall swearing around
the Hawaiian ship Fort George yesterday
afternoon. A small case of castings went
overboard and two divers had to be sent
down to recover it. From one point of
view the case was not worth what was
spent to recover it, but from another it
* was the most valuable portion of a MM
i ton cargo. The Fort George takes away
i a very large quantity of machinery for a
' new sugar mill that is to be put up in the
islands. The box that went overboard :
contained all the small castings for the
mill, so had It been lost the machinery
would have been useless until the castings
were duplicated in the East.
Captain Morse, as soon as he heard of
the accident, sent for divers, and Keefe
and Roach went to his assistance. It did
not take them long to go down and secure
! the box. and Inside of half an hour it
1 was on the wharf again. The Fort George \
. is to sail on Friday, and will carry the :
most valuable cargo ever taken away by a
sailing ship. There are all kinds of ma
chinery in it, pianos, safes, furniture, lum
ber, fifty horses. 300 hogs and general
merchandise.
There is a great scarcity of sailors on
the water front, and in consequence the
captains are paving $40 -'blood money for
men. The Ardencraig. Benares and Whls
cott are all loaded and ready for sea. but
the men to man them cannot be found.
The Ardencraig wants twelve men. and
after much labor the boarding masters
have succeeded in getting five aboard.
The Willscott needs sixteen men, and not
one has been. put aboard her, and the Ben
ares is in the same box.
Not only are the men hard to secure,
but the few that remain by the ships are
stolen out of them when they go to Port
Costa to load. Men are in demand in the
grain sheds, and the bosses are only too
glad to pay a sailor $2 50 a day to handle
wheat. Freights are good, however, so
the captains do not begrudge the "blood
money" if they can only get the men.

was launched from Hall Bros.' yard at

and will carry 750.000 feet of lumber. She
was chartered before she was launched
and will begin loading at once for either
San Pedro or Honolulu.
The American ship Aryan will require
considerable overhauling before she can
go to sea again. She was chartered to
load sugar at Honolulu for New York, but
was leaking so badly when she reached
the islands that the charter had to be can
celed. She then came on here in ballast
for rerairs. The Aryan is now on the
dry dock.
The new tug Fearless has been char
tered by the Government from the John
D. Spreckels and Bros. Company. 'She
will be used as a tender for -the transports
and will remain in service during the con
tinuance of the trouble in the Philippines.

ORIENTAL TRADE
F. X. Schoonmaker Says Therein Lies
California's ._. pportunity.
Hon. F. X. Schoonmaker delivered an
Interesting lecture last night at Sherman.
Clay & Co.'s Hall, under the auspices of
the California State Board of Trade. His
subject was "The Oriental Tradeâ Cali- j
fornia's Opportunity." A large audience j
gathered to hear the distinguished
speaker. Mr. Schoonmaker was intro
duced by A. A. Watkins. president of the
Board of Trade. E. A. Denicke, president
of the Mechanics' Institute, occupied a
seat on the stage.
Mr. Schoonmaker prefaced his remarks
by an appeal for the removal of the ex
isting prejudices against the Chinese race.
He referred to the inventive genius of the
latter, which had not as yet been paral
leled by any European nation. "China, by
its attainments in the world of art.' - he
said, "is entitled to our earnest and re
spectful consideration. Th* 1 wonderful
ability and capacity of its people make it i
a most dangerous competitor and a most j
potent ally In commercial affairs. It is a ;
fact that China can sell sllk as cheap as I
we can calico. This patient, singular and
homogeneous people are able â  to accom- I
plish more substantia results in manufac- !
tures and the arts than any other people, i
and we should cultivate their trade, In
which California, on account of its geo- j
graphical position, is vitally interested.
"The peculation of China is now not i
less than 150.000.i-jO. and In ISM it had
passed the point ' of subsistence, or the â¢
point where the land could feed them.
Two billion bushels of wheat yearly will j
China require for consumption, and Cali
fornia's chance is here on account of the .
rejection of wheat of Siberia and Argen
tine for obvious reasons. China has con- ;
eluded that flour will take the place of !
rice In its food, and has decided that it
will buy from the United States, be
cause no dollar she g9n* us will ever be j
shot back."
FAVOR THE NEW TREATY.
Enthusiastic Meeting of Japanese in
Golden Gate Hall Last Night.
The new treaty between Japan, the
United States and the European powers
went into effect yesterday, and last night
the local Japanese residents held a mass
meeting in Golden Gate Hall in honor of
the occasion. The hall was prettily dec
orated with Japanese and American flags,
harmoniously blended with bunting and
the flags of all nations.
The opening address was made by X.
Satow, chairman of the meeting and man
ager of the local Japanese mission. In
classic Japanese he stated the object of
the meeting and gave a brief history of
Japan's relations with the other nations
from the day the first white man visited
its shores to the ratification of the present
treaty. At the conclusion of his address
the audience, composed almost wholly of
Japanese, arose In a body and sung *-_vim
igavo " the Japanese national anthem.
This was followed by addresses by S.
Yamamura. chairman of the committee;
X Obata, H. Sakuri, Tozana. agent of the
Japanese Bank: Rev. Dr. Harris. Rev. Dr.
Sturge and Count Mutsu.
At the conclusion of the addresses three
cheers were given for the Emperor of
Japan, the Empress, the empire and Pres
ident McKinley. ; __ â 
The new treaty was warmly praised by
each of the speakers. It practically places
Japan on an equal footing with other na
tions. Formerly there was one law for
Japanese In Japan and another for for
eigners. Now the same laws govern all.
Foreigners were also excluded from do
ing business in or even traveling through
portions of the country without special
permit, but now the whole empire is
thrown open to all.

At a meeting of the Chamber of Com
merce yesterday a resolution was passed
to present to the- proper authorities the
sentiment of the chamber on the matter

could be placed on the market there under
the same favorable conditions as those of
other countries. The resolution carries
the request that changes be made to this
end. The sum of $100 waa voted to assist

Depositions on the Point Cause
Lengthy Argument Between
Counsel.
The reading of the many depositions
occupied the day during the trial of the
action of Dr. George A. Lung, surgeon of
the Philadelphia, against his wife, Eliza
beth, yesterday. W. H. Humphreys*
deposition was read,, but as the instru
ment, in which the conduct of Mrs. Lung
Is classified as extremely unladylike,
failed to show how the deponent obtained
his knowledge, it was objected to and a
long argument resulted. Judge Murasky
took the matter under advisement and a
decision will be rendered to-day. Other
depositions, heretofore published, were
read, and shortly after 4 o'clock an ad
journment was taken. Dr. Lung remained
behind until after his wife had left the
building, and then, accompanied by his
counsel, went to the hotel.
No mention of the assault made by Mrs.
Lung upon Detective True was made and.
A3 far as the case is concerned, the in

THE PHILIPPINES NOT WANTED.
A SIGNIFICANT incident took place at the
A Orpheum on the nieht oi the reception given tc
* â  the Oregon volunteers. The programme of the
entertainment included an evening at the theater, and
..... ,
400 of the volunteers were provided with seats at the
Orpheum. The number, it will be seen, was sutn
cientlv large to thoroughly represent the sentiment ot
the regiment. That is the fact which gives signih
cance to what occurred.
During the evening one of the performers. Oeorge
West, me upon the stage to deliver a speech upon
topics of the day. He began by asking: "Do we want
â¢the Philippines?'' Instantly from tiie volunteers the
response went back. "No." If there were any affirm
ative voices they were so few they were lost in the
volume of sound of that emphatic negativeâ a nega
tne made doubly impressive by the tact that the vol
unteers rose to their feet to give it force.
"Do we want the Philippines?" That is the ques
tion which persons who have not had time or oppor
tunity to study the issue fully are asking all over the
United States. "No." That is the answer which the
volunteers, who have had experience in the islands,
give in response to the question.
The Oregon volunteers are representative of the
truest American manhood. They are not among
those who give their country lip service only. When
the war with Spain broke out they offered to the re
public their strength, their valor and their lives. They
left their homes to go wherever the service of the
ration needed them. They were sent to the Philip
pines, and there they proved themselves faithful to
every duty and loyal to everj- trust. No one dare ac
cuse them of being weaklings or false to the true
grandeur of the republic. They speak with the
authority ot men who have attested their patriotism
by the arduous proofs of service at the front, and the
voice of their patriotism declares "we do not want the
Philippines."
SAN FRANCISCO AND THE STATE FAIR
BEING the metropolitan county of the State, San ;
Francisco is bound by "many obligations to give
liberal and potent aid I 3 every- undertaking de
signed for the general good of the commonwealth. It,
therefore, behooves her manufacturers, her merchants
and her citizens generally to co-operate with the State
Board of Agriculture in the effort to make the annual |
State Fair a comprehensive exposition of all the in
dustries of the State.
The board is makir.i. extraordinary efforts for the '
'. . . '. 7 ' T , ' Â« i_
fair o: this year. It has ta-cen steps to arouse tne va
rktus counties of the State to a realization of their in
terests in the matter, has appealed to the granges and
agricultural societies, and. finally, has urged the cities
and manufacturing industries to co-operate in the j
wcrk. Such efforts are bound to produce great re- .
suits, and San Francisco, for her own good if not for
that cf the State at larce. should provide for a notably
extensive exhibit of the work oi her industry.
It is crst::vins_; ... tnat the merchants ot Sacra
mento have become warmly interested in the move
ment to make the exposition of the year thoroughly
tepresentative of the whole State. It is now well as
sured they will render material assistance in making
the fair attractive to visitors from all parts of the
State, and, as a consequence, tne attendance will un
doubtedly be larger than ever before.
San Francisco should be represented by the best
and largest exhibit at the exposition. It is to her in
terest that such should be the case. It is time, there
fore, that steps were taken to accomplish that result.
Last week The Call published an interview with a
returned Oregon volunteer officer in which it was
made clear that the true situation in the Philippines
was being hidden from the eyes of the American peo
ple. Now comes a round robin from the press cor
respondents at Manila confirming that interview. The
Call's local contemporaries are busy getting into the
line marked out for them by this paper. All of which
reminds us that, if you see it in The Cali. it's so; if
you see it in the other papers it's only so so.
Indians throughout the Territory are ghost-dancing
to beat the band, notwithstanding the efforts of I pa
ternal Government to prevent the practice. Some
body will soon have to pay the piper.
FAITHFUL TO THEIR PLEDGES
THE Supervisors have now completed their work
as a Board of Equalization, and the results are
before the public, to be judged on their merits.
All that the people desired and justice calls for has
not been done, but none the less sufficient has been
| accomplished to afford ground for more satisfaction
! than has been derived from the work of any previous
! Board of Supervisors within the memory of this gene
; ration.
The issue before the Equalizers was raised by the
I assessments made by Assessor Dodge, These were
; found to be unfair and inequitable, inasmuch as the
i property of many smal. holders had been assessed too
; high and that of the larger corporations, such as the
street railway companies. Spring Valley Water Com
; pany, the Telephone Company and Wells-Fargo Com
' pany, had been assessed too low.
In view of the importance of the issue and the com
plexity of the problems involved, the Republican
members of the board sought to obtain ten days more
: time for equalization. Their efforts in that direction
were defeated by the dilatory tactics of the Demo- j
cratic minority. They were therefore compelled to
complete the work yesterday and to do the best that
was possible within the time allowed.
That much of explanation is due to enable the pub
lic to understand why there has been shortcoming in
the work of equalization, and to fix the blame upon
the parties who are responsible for it.
The results on the whole are good. A considerable
number of reductions were made in the case of small
property-holders whose assessments had been fixed
too high by Assessor Dodge. The assessment of the
Mark Street Railway Company was raised $600,000,
and that of the Oakland Water Company $100,000,,
over the estimates of the Assessor. . Efforts to raise
the assessments of the Sutter Street Railway Com
pany, the Telephone Company, Wells-Fargo Com- 'â 
pany and others were defeated by the means we have
stated. The people, therefore, have the satisfaction
of seeing that much has been done toward an 'honest j
equalization of property for taxation, and of knowing
who is to blame for the failure to accomplish more.
By the record thus made as a Board of Equaliza- ;
tion the Supervisors have once more demonstrated a
fidelity to their campaign pledges and to the true in
terests of the public, which has been, unfortunately,
rare in the history of San Francisco politics. In sev- !
eral instances the loyalty of the board in this way has !
been maintained against such opposition as to deserve
to be recalled to public attention.
Briefly stated, the board has kept its pledge to reduce ,
water rates and gas rates both for the city and the pri- j
vate consumer; it defeated the scheme of the Market [
Street Railway to grab franchises that would have in
flicted a wrong upon the community; it has closed,
Ingleside Park and rid the community of the scan
dal, the disgrace and the ruin that attended the opera
tion of that gambling racetrack; it has now made a
more equitable equalization of taxable property than
ever before known in the city, and against the oppo
sition of a thousand adverse forces has held firmly to
the pledge to keep the rate ot taxation within the dol
lar limit on a valuation of $350,000,000.
For these good results tne people 01 San Francisco
are indebted directly to the majority of the Super
visors themselves, but indirectly to the Republican
pany, which nominated them, elected them and has
upheld them in the performance of their duÂ£\ The
record is ... of which the party can be proud.
Two years ago Mayor Phelan was given permission
to select a ticket of Supervisors for the Democratic
oartv. and by reason of popular confidence in him a
majority ot the ticket was elected. The results were
disastrous to every* interest Of tne municipality. ihe
record of the Phelan Board or Supervisors was about
â¢" â  ' 1 -T_ _" ; 'J /,r '-_.__ ' '
the worst in our annals. It was permeated with cor
ruption. and it perpetrated almost every* lorm 01 dis
honest lobberv known to politics. The people profited
by the lesson, and at the late election ten Republican
Supervisors were chosen and but two Democrats.
The results are now before the people. They speak
for themselves. The board has kept its pledges faith
fully so far. and it is safe to say will continue to do so.
If the dollar limit be not maintained when the tax â 
lew is finally disposed of it will be only because the j
men who asked the pledge come forward and request
in the interest of the municipality that it be set aside
to whatever extent may be necessary for the general
welfare.
Thus far, at any rate, the Republicans of the board
have been true to a. their obligations and merit from j
the people the commendation, '"Good and faithful
* * â¢ 1
sen-ants, well done."
THE VflN WYCK COLLAPSE.
WHEN the Democratic National Committee
holds tne meeting arranged :or Thursday at
Chicago it is probable that above the racket |
of the Windy City there will be heard the sound uf j
something failing from a great height into the mud. |
It will be the Van Wyck Presidential boom, and the
men who let it drop will be representatives of Tarn- ;
many Hall.
It will be remembered that Augustus Van Wyck j
gave up, at the instigation of Tammany, a judicial
office for which he was well fitted and with which he
was weli satisfied to lead a forlorn hope in the State
campaign against Roosevelt. It was stated at the
time that in consideration for the sacrifice Tammany
would support Van Wyck as the candidate oi New
York for the Presidential nomination in iooo. It now
appears that Tammany has grown weary of the bar
gain. A slight attempt was made to launch the Van j
Wyck boom in Tammany Hai! on the Fourth of July,
but the braves received in silence the presentation of
his name, and then, to make the rejection more pro
nounced, burst into long and loud cheering at the j
-
Tammany, it seems, has shed no tears over the col- j
lapse of the boom. The chiefs have a decided prefer
ence for Gorman, and were no doubt very- we:! pleased
when the Kings County man was sidetracked at the
Fourth of July meeting. It is now announced they
have made up their minds to abandon him altogether.
and when the Democratic National Committee meets
j notice will be given that New York will have no can
didate for the Presidency to present to the National
ar.
It will be easy, of course, to drop Van Wyck. but
\ anerward it will not be easy for those who drop him
. tc resume harmonious relations with the Democracy
of Brooklyn, for the Democrats of that borough have
; a good deal of pride in their local man and consider
him entitled to some consideration for the fight he
: made in the last campaign. Thus the anti-Bryan
j forces are menaced with a faction fight in their camp
; at a time when they need the utmost unity of effort
to ac.
The situation affords another illustration of the
\ confusion prevailing in the conservative wing. of the
; Democratic party by reason of a lack of able leader
! ship. If they could agree among themselves to back
Gorman something might be accomplished, for the
ability of the Marylar.cer as a leader and as an or
j ganirer is not to be disputed. With a division in
i New York itself, however, between the supporters of

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, JULY IS, 1899.
Gorman and the friends of Van Wyck, the outlook
is not promising. Bryan can hardly wish the camp
of his opponents to be in a worse condition than it is.
OUR CONSULAR SERVICE.
â 
SO much in the way of criticism and fault-finding
has been said of late concerning our consular
! service it is gratifying to find one man who
{ speaks with some authority on the subject, pointing
out the brighter side and commending the Consuls
i generally for the efficiency of their work in promot-
I ing our commercial interests.
William Harper, who as a representative of the
j Philadelphia Commercial Museum, has made an ex
tensive tour through South America, Australia, Asia,
: Africa and Europe collecting exhibits for the
museum, has now reached London on his way home,
i and in the course of an interview in that city has cx
i pressed a high degree of satisfaction at the consular
service as he found it to be in his many relations
with it.
In the course of his conversation Mr. Harper is
quoted as saying: "In my journeyings I have given
the consular service considerable study, and my con
clusions are that while the longer tenure of office of
British Consuls enables them to become better lin
guists and diplomats than our own, they are often
lacking in business qualifications. As commercial
missionaries I believe the Americans are the more
efficient. Many of them are doing great work to
ward the development of the market for American
goods in the countries where they are stationed."
Of course, such commendation does not imply that
an improvement might not be made in the service by
removing its offices from the spoils of politics. It not 1
infrequently happens under our system that when a
faithful and energetic Consul has acquired a sufficient
knowledge of the opportunities for American trade in
the country where he is stationed to enable him to
apply his energies with efficiency, he is removed to
make way for the appointee of a new administration.
That evil, however, has been pointed out so often an
exaggerated importance has been given to it. At any
rate our foreign trade has been increasing rapidly,
and there can be no question but what reports of our
Consuls have been a valuable aid in promoting it. It
is only fair that we should give credit where it is due,
and the testimony of Mr. Harper concerning the
commercial zeal of the Consuls deserves a careful
consideration throughout the country.
O CCORDING to a recent dispatch from Europe
j\ the Russian Minister of Railways has made an
* " official announcement that when the trans-
Siberian railway is completed it will be possible to
make a trip around the globe in thirty-three days.
The Minister's estimate of time required for the dif
ferent stages of the journey is given as follows:
* Days.
From St. Petersburg to Vladivostok 10
From Vladivostok to San Francisco 10
From San Francisco to New York >. 4*-_s

When Jules Verne wrote his famous romance,
"Around the World in Eighty Days," he gave what
was supposed by the people of that time an al
most impossible task to his hero, Phileas Fogg. In
iÂ§73Â» the date ii the romance, it needed a vigorous
imagination to devise means by which the trip could
be accomplished. It will be remembered that it cost
Fogg something like $100,000 to in his bet. In a
comparatively few years, however, improved railway
facilities and swifter steamers rendered it possible for
Nellie Bly to make the trip in sixty-four and a half
days. That record could now be beaten if any one
would pay for railway specials to accomplish it.
Such being the rapid development of around the
world transportation in the last few years it is prob
able that by 1904, the time the trans-Siberian road is
expected to be open, the speed of steamers and of
railway trains will be so much greater than now the
journey can be made in much less time than the Rus
sian Minister estimates.
When Jules Verne calculated the time for his ro
mance he allowed seven days for the journey from
San Francisco to New York. The Russian estimates
four and a half days for the same trip. Special trains
have already made the run in less time than that, and
by 1904 it is probable the regular trains will make it
inside of four days. The trans-Siberian trains also
may traverse the distance across Northern Asia much
more quickly than the Minister now estimates, and
of course swifter steamers on each of the great oceans
will lessen the lime required for the ferry from one
railroad to another. Thus when the big Russian en
terprise is completed the time required to circle the
globe may be almost a week less than that which is
now announced as something wonderful to come.
OUR PROSPEROUS RAILROADS
rROM a summary, just made public, of railway
statistics for the year IS9S, compiled by the In
terstate Commerce Commission, it appears the
year was one of extraordinary activity in railroad
circles and of corresponding prosperity.
The most notable feature of the report is the show
ing made of the increase of mileage. It appears th.-.-.
during the year ending June 30, IS9S, there were con
structed 40SS miles of railway, bringing the total mile
age for that date up to the enormous amount of
247.532 miles. Xo better evidence could be given of
the general prosperity and increasing business of the
roads, for without such encouragement there would
not have been such an extensive construction of new
roads or development of existing ones.
Evidence of prosperity, however, is shown in
other ways than in that of extended mileage. Dm
the year only eleven roads went into the hands of
receivers, while forty-five passed out of them. The
mileage of roads in receivers' hands was reduced by
over 11,000 miles, and the decrease in the capital stock
of roads in such hands amounted, to 5_.21.0__7, 239.
Other statistics given in the summary are equally
gratifying. The total number of passengers carried
was 501,066,681, an increase of 11,621 The total
number of tons of freight carried one mile, per mile
of line, was 617.810. which was greater by 98.731 than
the previous year. The gross earnings of the whole
mileage was $1,247,323,621, an increase of $125,235,
--848. An interesting feature is a wage soma - com
piled from over 99 per cent of the total employes.
There were paid in wages $493,035,618, an increase
for the year of $29-154.037. This sum represented
60.52 per cent of the total 9perating expenses.
It is to be regretted that these reports cannot be
made more promptly. Statistics for the year ending
June 30. 1898. published for the first time in July,
is99..seem like back numbers in the rush of American
life, and can hardly interest the average citizen. It
is to be borne in mind, however, that it is difficult
to obtain information from railway companies.
When required to furnish information for the public
their officials are slower than freight â¢- as. If the
people desire prompter responses and more accurate
j reports Congress will have tog more power to the
: Interstate Commerce Commission.

ville theater, having a seating capacity !
of two thousand. "winding staircases are
to be erected in two of the legs, and in |
the other two electric elevators will make ;
continual trips.
The other idea suggested was for the !
construction of a 'â¢Jonah" theater, a i
mammoth whale of iron and steel, which 1
several regiments of the National Guard

a part of the National Guard of the

I Sunday night, and expressed his disgust
: that her aim was so bad. The charge
! of assault to murder against her was dis

! charge of battery and wiil be sentenced

The evidence showed that Bonner at
tempted to force an entrance into her
home at Illinois and Seventeenth streets,
and hearing the noise she opened the door.
Bonner aimed a vicious blow at her but
it feil short, and she immediately opened
fire upon him. as she had armed herself
with a revolver, expecting trouble. None
of the shots took effect.
The police clva Bonner a bad name. He
had been arrested on numerous occasions,
and recently because Mrs. Mack's hus
band is out of the city he has been pes
tering her with his attentions.
Drummers Net Licensed.
The United States Circuit Court handed
down a decision yesterday in the case of
F. W. Tinsman on habeas corpus from
the Sausalito jail. Tinsman was agent for
a Chicago firm in soliciting orders for
enlarging portraits. He was convicted by
a Sausalito Solomon of doing business
without a license.
The court held that the ordinance un
der which Tinsman was convicted is un
constitutional because it is in conflict with
the provision of the United States con
stitution relating to commerce among the
several States..

THE officials of the National Ath

for their exhibition m Thursday
night at Woodward's Pavilion
which should catch the fancy of the
men who enjoy a rattling boxing
match. George Green and Charley Goff
will mix skill with hard bitting, while
Jeffords and Jones, the two "J's," will
trust to strength alone to win for
them. "Many of the sporting men are
ardent supporters of Goff after seeing
him perform with Franey recently.
Franey was smaller in stature than

SOUTHAMPTON. July 17.â Early this
i morning: the Shamrock unbent her
â â  mainsail and tried a new one. Having
done this, .-ho proeeeeded down South
ampton waters with a moderate breeze
from the east. She made a straight
reach over to Cowes, carrying jib-head
ed topsail, foresails and mainsail. Her
arrival 8* Cowes caused great delight
to a part} of seven Americans who
were lunching at Gloster Hotel. Go-
I ins? about, the Shamrock made a hard
] beat of it to Ryde, coming back on a
clear, run, with her glorious-looking
snlnrak-r. which she boomed out for
the first time.
It sef mcd to nn> that she traveled
freer, ti-.at she splashed the water less
in her run to-day than in her former]
j skim. The wind had almost entirely ;
| died out by the time she returned.
At the same time the Britannia was |
i out, looking full of life. She and the ;
Shamrock parsed one another during
the spin. In comparison, there is no de- j
: nving that the Shamrock looks some- j
â¢ what squat in the water and has not so]
much life.

'â¢You may be sure that tho Shamrock â

THK annual race of California Yacht Club for the Wallace trophy was
won on Sunday for the second time by the sloop Edna. She finished 36

opponent. He knows every trick of the
skilled boxer and can hit or take pun
ishment. Knowing he was to meet a
desperate fighter, Green has taken
more than the usual precautions in
conditioning himself. He has lived at
the ocean beach and has boxed with
Danny Needham, who is about the
same height as Goff. .
Jeffords leaped into prominence re
cently by undertaking to stay four
rounds with Champion Jeffries. The
matchmaker!-, unfortunately. com
menced at the wrong end. They first
made the match and then consulted W.
A. Brady, who controls Jeffries' desti
nies at the present time. With a con
tinental tour in prospect he declined
to jeopardize the standing of the man
who lowered the colors of Fitzsim
mons. Jeffordses not a novice. In a
match with Jack Stelzner he had the
latter in difficulty for nine rounds and
then resorted to rough tactics. Stelz
ner, who has boxed with Jeffries,
Sharkey. Corbett and Fitzsimmons,
pronounces Jeffords the strongest man
in the group.
Jones, his opponent, has been spoil
ing for a fight. While Ruhlin was in
training he journeyed to his quarters
at Blanken's to be tried out. Ruhlin
would not assume the risk of injuring
his hands while he had an engage
ment pending, hence the colored man
has yet to be tried out.
Hiram B. Cook will referee and the
men will box under Marquis of Queens
berry rules without amendments. The

killed one. At the tmalpaia Club "Billy"
Brown ami Mr. Osborn si cured forkhorn
bucks, while Wagner and Drlnkhouse
killed spike bucks.
A phenomenon which none # of the sports
men can explain is that the Country Club
men killed unusually large bucks, while
those of the Tamalpais Club were com
paratively small. The preserves adjoin
one another. Thii nature of the country
is the same and the deer feed over the
same range; hence the question as to why
the large ones all fell to Country Club
men.
The deer were all brought to the Cali

general attention throughout the day.

HARD-HITTING AMATEURS
AT SAN FRANCISCO CLUB
Four eight-round bouts and one of ten
rounds is the attractive card offered by
the San Francisco Athletic Club for its
regular monthly boxing contests to be
held to-morrow "night. Owing to the qual
ity of the sport invariably presented at
the gymnasium of the club on Sixth
street, the attendance has outgrown the
seating capacity of the gymnasium.
The principal bout on the programme
will be a ten-round affair between Ed
Toy and Georpe Baker, each to weigh in
at "the lightweight limit. 133 pounds. The
remaining bouts will be between Charles
Vickers and Jack Ennls: Charles Thurs
ton and Henry Lewis: Mike McClure and
Dan Ryan; Deacon Jones and Snowball
Crawford. The latter pair boxed recently
and mixed hard hitting and buffoonery,
to the evident delight of the spectators
Alex Greggains will referee under the
Queensberry rules, unabridged, the only
ones which seem to give general satisfac
tion. With Greggains in the ring there
are no unsatisfactory bouts.
RAIN CAUSES DELAY.
DETROIT, .- July 17. â A five-minute
downpour of rain spoiled the afternoon's
sport at to-day's annual opening of the
Blue Ribbon race meeting. The down
pour occurred just as the horses were
scoring for a start in the 2:09 pace, the
first race on the grand circuit programme
of 1*99. The storm ceased as suddenly
as it began, but It left the Grosse Point
track in a hopelessly sticky condition.
The crowd waited an hour and a half
and then came the following announce
ment:
"On account of the dangerous condition
of the track to-day's programme is post
poned until to-morrow."
The programme Included the Chamber
of Commerce $3000 stake. Tuesday's ro
grammc, including- the Merchants' and
Manufacturers' $10,000 stake, will be ion
tested on Wednesday and to-day's delay
will carry the meeting through Saturday
instead of it ending on Friday.

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK. July 17.â The stock market to
day was an aimless and insignificant affair j
except so far as the dullness and neglect were I
significant of the doubt felt in many mind? j
over the money outlook. Operations were j
strictly confined to professional manlpula- j
tion by the room traders. This kind of trading |
resulted in only trivial net changes, most of *
which were on the side of losses. The range
of prices was quite wide during the day, many j
stocks at times rising a shade over Saturday
and then dropping from 1 to 2 points. The
latter portion of the day was devoted to a dcs-
.â _--. covering movement xvhich reclaimed
most of the earlier losses. Even Brooklyn
Transit, which was the center of the day's
weakness, recovered to within % of Saturday's
close, but yielded sharply to bear pressure in
the final dealings. Labor troubles played a â¢
large part In the day's market, Brooklyn Tran- j
sit being most conspicuously affected by rea- |
son of the strike among its employes. The j
etocks opened off 1% and Manhattan and Met
ropolitan Street Railway were keenly affected
ln sympathy, the former losing 1% and the
latter 3 points. Brooklyn Transit was vigor- j
ously supported by inside interests and quick- j
ly rallied a point*, giving the short Interests, 1
xvhich are supposed to be large, t-mall opportun- j
Ity to cover. Later the stocks fell an extreme ;
i-s. when the news came that the street car
strike in Cleveland had been renewed, as it j
was feared this might presage a general sym- j
pathetic strike. People's Gas and Federal i
Steel, as being Flower specialties, were de- j
pressed ln sympathy with the Brooklyn stocks. :
Federal Steel dropping 1%. New York Air
Brake also broke 12 points and after vibrating
wildly scored a full recovery. American I
Smelting moved upward on the decision of the j
Colorado Supreme Court against the constitu
tionallty of the State's eight-hour law. ihe con
flicting Interpretations of which led to the
amelter strike. Tin Plate moved up on th a :
wage scale agreement and the advance in the i
of the product. Late weakness of Brook
yr. Transit and a break in Sugar of nearly 2
points brought the most active selling move
ment of the day. There were very persistent :
rumors that gold would go from New York
this week. Transaction? in the local stock i
market for London account were, however. in
significant. The absence of any announcement - 1
of any gold shipment by to-morrow's steamer
was a factor in the late recovery of the mar- :
ket which brought prices generally back to
near Saturday's close.
The market for bonds was dull and heavy
in sympathy with stocks. Total sales, par
value, $1,650,000.
United States 33 fell % and the old 4s regis- .
tered "-Â« in bid price.

%c to %c lower for September, at 724tff72V.
The opening quotations were the highest of the
day. Excellent weather for ring wheat. |
heavy domestic receipts and a decline of 4d \
to Id at Liverpool furnished the bears with a j
surplus of ammunition, and they used it with j
good effect. When the visible supply report j
was completed showing an increase of 543. 000
j bushels, compared with a decrease of over ]
2,000.000 bushels the same week last year, long j
1 wheat was thrown on the market regardless cf
price. Primary Western markets received 1.135,
--000 bushels, compared with 568.000 bushels a
year ago. The English visible supply increased
5.2,000 bushels, against 112.000 bushels decrease
last year. The market ruled very heavy. Sep
tember selling down to 714 c. and closing at
I the bottom of the day's range.
CORNâ heavy. Influenced by fin- grow
ing weather and liberal receipts September
closed 4c to %< lower.
OATSâ Were weak and lower on favorable
; weather and sympathy with wheat and corn.
September closed with a loss of %c.
PROVISIONS Were firm. notwithstanding
the weakness of cereals. Opening prices showed
some improvement due to an advance of 6c
in bogs. The market was loaded with long
stuff on the advance, and most -if the early
advance was wiped out before the close. Specu

WHEAT AND OTHER GRAINS.
WHEATâ Lower Llverpoool quotations and
flne weather in the Northwest depressed the
Chicago market at the opening. In addition |
there was a prospect of a material increase in .
the visible supply, while the Corn crop prom
ised to be a record breaker. The world's ship
ments were 6.000,000 bushels, but there was a
decrease of 2.000.01 on passage. The only bull ]
news was from France, where unfavorable
weather caused crop estimate? to be reduced, j
There was some demand from the shorts, but
they turned around and began to resell, which
still further depressed the market.
The local situation was very dull, with a fur
ther decline in futures.

Wanted to Marry the Girl Because
She Remained Out at Night
and He Feared She Had
Been Imprudent-
Â»
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, July 17.
Because J. C. Johnson, a carpenter, liv
ing at 1369 Eleventh street, wanted to
marry his pretty niece-in-law, Edith
Gould, the latter left his home, preferring
to battle her way in the cold world rather
than, as she expressed it, "marry a man
old enough to be her grandfather."
"The unholy linking of youth with old
age" seems to be all the rage in Oakland
just at present. Only a short while ago
Capitalist Joseph Boardmau startled and
shocked society by taking to him a wife
who had just graduated from the High
School and who had only seen seventeen
brief summers. Johnson, who is 55 years
of age, wanted to go irdman one bet
ter, so he proposed to Edith Gould, who
is only 16 years of age.
Johnson's suit was as brief as her re
fusal of marriage was determined. About
a month ago Edith went to live with her
uncle-in-law. She had been at his house
scarcely two weeks before her elderly rel
ative became obnoxious by his persistent
offers of marriage. The girl left his home
and went to Piedmont, where she secured
work in a private family. On Saturday
Mabel Johnson, a daughter of Johnson,
called upon Chief of Police Hodgkins and
told lm that Edith had left her father's
home without saying where she was go
ing and that the family was very much
concerned about her. Detective Qulgley
was detailed on the case and he went to
Piedmont and brought the girl into the
city. She was questioned by Chief Hodg
kins, who declared that she told a straight
story and that there was nothing for the
police to do in the matter. Edith has
as a temporary guardian, J. E. Henderson
of the Homeflndlng Association.
Mr. Henderson makes the following
statement: "When Mrs. O. M Sanford,
the former secretary" of the associaiton,
went away about a year ago she left in
mv chatge a number of her wards, among
them being Edith Gould. A short while
ago .I;-- Johnsons came to me and said
that they wanted Edith to visit them. As
they were her near relatives 1 saw no
harm in her so doing and I permitted her
to go. When she Informed me that her
uncle had proposed to he* I told her to
leave the house. This she has done and
this is all there is to the case. At pres
ent she is at work in a. private family
at Piedmont."
Edith Gould herself confirms the state
ment made by Henderson.
At the Johnson home no one was to be
seen but Mabel Johnson. She said that
Edith had told her father of the harsh
way in which she had been treated at the
different places at which she had worked
and that he had felt sovty for her and I
.had made her an honorable proposal of
marriage. This Miss Johnson declared
was all there was to the matter. She said
Edith had been in the habit of staying
nut very late at night while at their home I
and that her father was afraid she had j
been i?. â¢-â prudent and that wanting to pro
tect her hp had proposed to her.
Edith Gould is a very handsome Monde.
She is- well developed for her age ' and
might ea-silv pass for IS -ears. She de
nies that she told her uncle that she had
been badly treated elsewhere or that she
remained out late nt night.
THOUGH ROCKEFELLER'S
UNCLE, HE DIED POOR
OAKLAND. July 17.â John R. Rockefel
ler, an aged indigent, died at the County
Infirmary last night and will probably
be buried in the potter's held at the
charge of the county.
If a statcmesit he made to some of the
other inmates recently be true he ls an
uncle of the Standard Oil magnate and
multi-millionaire. He dec'ared that his
nephew, who enjoys an Income of $56,000
and over dally, formerly sent him money,
but that ii slipped through his fingers on
account of his convivial habits and that
finally John D. had cut off the allowance
altogether. He claimed to be a native of
Ohio. aged 60 years.
Deceai-ed was sent to the infirmary sev
eral months ago upon an! order by Su
pervisor Church, who trives little credence
to the story of };i.s relationship with the
oil magnate. Had there been reason to

TO KEEP OUT OF NERVOUS PROS-

It is a lamentable fact that American
brain workers do not, as; a rule, knv.v
how to feed themselves to rebuild the
daily loss occasioned by ..olive mental
effort. This fact, coupled with the
disastrous effects of the alkaloids con-
tained in tobacco, coffee and whisky,
makes a sure pathway toward nervous

The remedy is simple enough. Em-
ploy the services of a food expert, who
knows the kind of food required to
rebuild the dally losses in the human
body. This can be done by making free
use of Grape Nuts, the famous break-
fast food, which contain-, exactly the
elemental principles which have an af-
finity for albumen and go directly to
rebuild the gray matter In the brain,
solar plexus and nerve centers through-
out the body. Follow your selection of
food up with a dismissal of coffee,

DEATH CALLS HOWARD
HAVENS, ARGONAUT.
HOWARD HAVENS.
ALAMEDA, July 17.â Death has
claimed another of the sturdy
pioneers who made the early his
tory of California. Howard Ha
vens, after an illness of several
weeks, died last night at his
home, 1031 San Antonio avenue. He was
one of the most prominent men of af
fairs in the State, the head of the Dono
hoe-Kelly Banking Company* and â  a
leader of the Society of California Pio
neers.
Mr. Havens was born April 26, 182 in
the city of New York. His father, Rens
selaer Havens, was a leading merchant of
that city, prominent in affairs, a large
subscriber to the voluntary contributions
by which the Government was enabled to
carry on the war of ISl__, and also the
owner of numerous privateers, the most
historical of which was the brig General
Armstrong, which he lost in the port of
FayaL Mr- Havens' family is one of the
oldest in America, his mother's ancestors
arriving here in 1626 and his father's in
1635. Both families intermarried with the
Deerings, Sylvesters, Van Hensselaers
and others.
When the "gold fever" of IMS swept
over the country, Mr. Havens Joined tie
band of Argonauts, who have made the
history of California. Landing in San
Francisco November 30, 1649. lie early
started in search of the "golden sands,"
INCENDIARIES ARE
HAUNTING BERKELEY
FIVE BLAZES COME WITHIN A
FEW DAYS.
BERKELEY, July 17.â Five mysterious
fires, occuring within almost as many
days, with no possible explanation of their
origin except incendiarism, are beginning
to alarm the residents of North Berkeley.
All signs point to the presence in the
neighborhood of some cool and deliberate
incendiary who for some reason or other
Is bent on destroying property and people
are beginning to grow anxious lest at any
moment their own residence should be
found in fiames.
A costly blaze this morning, equally
unexplained on any other theory save
that of premeditated Incendiarism, gave
fresh evidence that the fiend is still at his
work. The fire in question broke out at
about 4 o'clock in the residence of Moses
Morris, near the corner of Cedar street
and Shattuck avenue. It seemed as
though an attempt were being made if
possible to destroy the whole block, as the
blaze was started in such a way that the
strong wind blowing at the time would
have spread the flames rapidly had not
the fire companies lent prompt assistance.
It adds to the incendiary theory of this
morning's blaze that no fire had been
burned In the residence for over a week,
as the family is away for the summer
holidays. The only occupant at the time
was Mr. Morris himself, who stays in the
house over night. The North Berkeley
and the Columbia fire companies
responded quickly to the alarm,
but before they could arrive the
more serious part of the damage had been
done. From the Morris house the flames
spread to the house adjoining, owned by
J. P. Blount. The total damage to the
two places amounts to over $4000, two
thirds of which Is covered by insurance.
As soon as the blaze was extinguished the
appearance of the burned building point
ed distinctly to an outside origin of the
fire.
Early last week a similar attempt was
made upon the residence of James Scott,
near the corner of Virginia and Grant
streets. On that occasion the criminal
left abundant evidence of his work in a
basket of shavings and other combustibles
well soaked in coal oil and pushed into the
basement. Since then three similar at
tempts have been made in the vicinity
at the residences of Captain John Slater,
1335 Shattuck avenue: VV*. T. I-ingard. 1332
Waln-it street, and ii. W. Batchelder, on
Shattuck avenue, near Rose street.

tions. By taste and training a business
man, he soon gravitated back to the cen
ter of commerce. In 1885 he accepted the
position of treasurer with the Sacramento
Valley. Railway Company, and with the
other officers pushed that road to an early
completion At that time he represented
the interests of J. Mora Moss in this new
enterprise. After this railroad was dis
posed of to the Central Pacific, Mr. Ha
vens resigned his position and moved to
San Francisco, where he became asso
ciated with Donohoe, Kelly & Co.. bank
ers, in which flrm he subsequently became
the managing partner. On its incorpora
tion he was made vice president and man
ager. Several years ago, upon the death
of Joseph A. Donohoe, he was nominated
to the presidency.
Feeling the burden of years after an
active life, he retired from business and,
three years ago he came to live in Ala
meda.
As an honored and esteemed member
of the Society of California Pioneers, Mr.
Havens was for twenty-flve consecutive
years the unanimous choice of the society
as treasurer, no bonds ever being required
of him. He retired from the position
about ten years ago, though urged to re
tain the offlce.

FIRE LAYS A UKIAH
BLOCK IN ASHES
Believed to Have Been Started by a
Tramp Sleeping in a
Barn.
SANTA ROSA r July 17.â A special to the
Press-Democrat pays: The city of Ukiah,
the county seat of Mendocino County, was
visited by one of the most disastrous fires
in its history shortly after midnight last
night. As a result of the conflagration
an entire block in one of the principal
portions of the town is In ashes. The
flames first broke out In a small barn back
of H. M. Wright's livery stable, on State
street. In a few moments they had com
municated to the livery stable proper. Al
though every effort possible was made to
save the contents of the building, the fire
spread with such rapidity that only a few
horses and buggies were taken out. Three
horses perished In the flames. The large
stock of hay and pram was destroyed.
Wagner's saloon, the Chinese laundry
next door, I.ayton & Son's blacksmith
shop, the fire department engine house,
Chessal's blacksmith shop and J. Gobi, is'
residence went up in smoke. In the en
gine house was a hose reel containing
over 300 feet of hose, which was destroyed.
Considerable paraphernalia belonging to
the hose company was burned.
The presumption Is that* the fire was
started by a tramp in the barn where the
flames were first seen. If this is the case
the man escaped, for no bodies were
found, although the ashes were searched.
Great difficulty was experienced In fight
ing the fire on account of the scarcity of
water. Owing to repairs being conducted
at the water works the supply had been
shut off entirely. When the alarm was
sounded it was necessary to dispatch a
man on horseback to the water works to
have the water turned on.
The loss will approximate $15,000, only
partially Insured. -.-â¢.'-

PACIFIC GROVE, July 17.â Owing to
the fact that the victory of Santiago de

American valor that reached the climax
in the surrender of General Toral and th-?
laying down of the arms of nearly twenty

Insane Stranger Threatens to Call

t
Oakland Office San Francisco Call, j
90S Broadway, July 17.
Calvin P. Hinds, proprietor of the Bos- :
ton Meat- Market, 841 San Pablo avenue, |
reported to the police to-day an expe- |
rience he had last Saturday night, pre
sumably with a maniac, the particulars of j
which rival those of the murderous at
tack made on H. K. Belden with an ax
several weeks ago.
It was about closing time, according to
Mr. Hinds* statement, when a stranger of
medium height and apparently 35 years
of age stepped into his market, casually
inspecting some of the meats hanging on |
the racks. The stranger's visit aroused |
no particular curiosity, but after the mar
ket had been deserted by the usual even- ;
ing shoppers, the stranger suddenly
grabbed a huge butcherknlfe from one of j
the blocks, and rushing at Hinds he de- i
clared that he had come to kill him if he j
moved.
"It's no crime to kill butchers!" shouted j
the stranger, his eyes glaring like those j
of a madman; "for they kill innocent ,
cattle and playful lambs. That's why I
kill butchers, and there's nothing wrong
about that."
Realizing now that he was to be made
the victim of a murderous attack by a
maniac, and being so situated that he
could not reach a weapon of defense.
Hinds tried his persuasive powers, and
agreeing that all butchers are a bad lot
suggested that if he should be spared he
would never again kill cattle, but would
assist ln annihilating those who persist
in so doing. . TT . -
During an unguarded moment, Hinas
made a desperate dash for a heavy meat
cleaver, and the stranger, realizing that
he had been outwitted, promptly retreated
to the door and hurled the knife at the
butcher. Fortunately the point of the i
blade was imbedded in a block.
Almost prostrated over his narrow es
cape' Hinds stood dumfounded, while the
retreating assailant shouted: "I will not
kill you now. You can live three weeks
longer and then I'll get you." With these !
words the stranger left and has not been :
.-â¢â â¢ 1 1 since. , , _
Mr. Hinds declares that he had never
met the stranger before, and that he is
not aware of any reason why any one,
should desire his death.
The description of Hinds' assailant tal
lies with that of Frank Cheeseman, the
murderer who some weeks ago escaped
from the Stockton Insane Asylum, but it
is not believed to be the murderer of j
Henry Brooke, for the police are now con
fident that Cheeseman has gone East to j
an uncle.
A stranger answering the same descrip
tion recently entered a house on Third
street, awakening the Inmates and act-
I ing queerlv, though he attempted no vio
lence. The police authorities are Investi
| gating Mr. Hinds' case.

Spirited Argument in the Arbitration
Committee Meeting at The

THE HAGUE. July 17.â The third com
mittee, or arbitration commission, held a
plenary* meeting to-day, discussing inter
national commissions of inquiry and
adopting, with certain amendments, arti
cle 56, respecting the expenses of the
tribunal.
The section of article *>4, providing for
the revision of arbitral awards, which the
Americans had succeeded in adding to the
original project, was the subject of a long
debate on the motion of M. de Martens,
the Russian delegate, to eliminate the
amendment. Messrs. Holls and Low of
the American delegation made long
speeches in defense of the revision.
Mr. Holls, whose remarks were rapidly
translated into French by M. Destour
nelles, declared that the Americans would
be unable to agree to the arbitration
scheme If revisions were stricken out, un
less they received further Instructions
from Washington. This announcement
created a sensation*.

Wireless Telegraphy for Hawaii.
HONOLULU, July 4.â There appears to
be a strong probability that an attempt
will shortly be made to connect the sev
eral more important islands of the Ha
waiian group by the Marconi system of
wireless telegraphy. It is thought by the
electrician handling the project that Oahu
can be readily connected with Molokai,
thence to Maui and thence to Hawaii.
It is thought even feasible to reach Kauai
from Oahu, although tfie distance is sixty

IN NO HURRY TO ACT.
Marin Supervisors Have Not Amend
ed the Game Ordinance.
SAN RAFAEL, July 17.â The Supervis
ors of Marin County are pursuing the
even tenor of their way in the matter i
of game ordinances and seemingly care
nothing for the storm of criticism result- ;
ing from their legislation. At the last j
meeting W. S. Dreypolcher and Dr. Hib
bard appeared before the board and ex
plained that the clause In the game or
dinance making it illegal to use a repeat
ing shotgun was unjust, because It dis
criminated in favor of wealthy members
of the club as against individual sports
men who could not afford a high priced
gun. They declared the clause making
it illegal to kill more than twenty-five
quails in a day subserved the required
result without the necessity of forcing
about fifty sportsmen to purchase new
guns. The matter was taken under con
sideration by the board and at to-day s
session It .was decided that as consider
able time would elapse before the open
season for quails arrived no action oe
taken until the matter could be fully in
vestigated. The opponents of the objec
tionable clause say that if it is not re
pealed they will test the whole game or
dinance in the courts and are continent
that it can be proved unconstitutional.

to-day that he showed two years ago, j
when he won the championship. He beat
Hackett without the slightest difficulty. i

morrow. Summary:

McCue Wins on a Foul.
NEW YORK, July 17.â At the Coney
Sporting Club to-night Martin Mc-Cue of
New York won from George Siddons of
New Orleans on a foul. McCue had the
better of it from the start. During the
seventh round Siddons was repeatedly
warned for hitting in clinches. In the
eighth round, near the close. Siddons land
ed a left body punch while locked, and the
referee stopped the bout and declared M c-
Cue had won on a foul. Jack Downey of
Brooklyn got the decision over Jerome
Quigley of Philadelphia in the eleventh
round. Quigley was almost helpless, and
the referee stopped the bout.
NINE FISTIC BOUTS.
Opening Entertainment of the Ob
servatory Athletic Club.
The initial athletic entertainment of
the Observatory Athletic Club was held
last night in the Observatory building at
the top of Telegraph Hill. It was a suc
cess in every particular, from the referee,
who was Tom Sharkey, down to the spec
tators, whose chief and shining light was
Spider Kelly.
Nine three-round exhibition contests
made up the programme. They were
tame, courteous affairs, with no blood
spilling and no ill-feeling between con
testants. Of such a friendly nature were
the bouts that no decision was thought
necessary at the termination of the
matches, and all Sharkey's labors
amounted to the simple waving of his
mighty fist. The spectators now and then
showed a growing enthusiasm which at
the end of the evening resulted in a cheer
that shivered the fog on the outside.
The nine contests run off In rapid order
were as follows: Jacko Griffin and Ja
cobus McCarthy; Michael Angelo Pera
and Francois Landuci; Amilio Langford
an*'. Ezekil Zemrok; Carolus Ravioli and
Jardin Gallieno; Young Jeffries and Faus
tus Skevio; Hannibal Flaherty and Wil
helra Iverson; Thunderbolt Irwin and
Sandow Pete; Bud Terry and Julius Cae
sar Coleman, and Titian McDonald and
Garibaldi Vacrarlo.
HEARST NOT LIABLE
IN PUNITIVE DAMAGES
RESPONSIBLE FOR ACTUAL DAM
AGES TO McDONALD.
Judge de Haven Lays Down the Law
in a Suit to Punish the Theft
of a Copyright.
United States District Judge de Haven
yesterday overruled the demurrer to the
answer in the case of A. L. McDonald vs.
W. R. Hearst.
The suit was brought to recover J52.729
damages for violation of copyright, Mc-
Donald complaining that the Examiner
had published McDonald's map of
the Klondike district, without au- I
thority or permission from him. |
The Examiner claimed a circulation of j
5Ti.729 (Including the garbage crematory is
sue); and the damages asked were, as â 
provided in the statute, $1 for each copy j
of the. publication in which the map ap- j
pearod. _ _ .
Mr. Hearst filed an answer to the effect ;
that he was in New York at the time the j
Examiner stole Mr. McDonald's map;
that he had not ordered the theft, and,
in fart, did not know anything about it.
and that he should not* therefore be held
liable in punitive damages.
To this answer Mr. McDonald interposed
a demurrer.
Judge de Haven in giving his decision
said that this answer must, in the face j
of a general demurrer, be construed as
sufficiently alleging that the defendant
did not personally participate in the com
mission of the wrongful act complained
of, nor authorise his servants or agents
to commit such alleged wrong.
CRIMINAL OPERATION.
Mrs. Mary Plate's Funeral Stopped
and an Autopsy Held by the
Coroner.
Mrs Mary Plate, a married woman 27
years old, residing at 22 Lafayette street,
died last Saturday after a very brief ill
ness. She was attended by Dr. L. W.
Sprigg, who graduated from a medical
college about a week ago.
The body was to have been buried yes
terday afternoon, but Miss Hall, a sister
of the dead woman, reported to the Coro
ner her suspicions that death was the re
sult of a criminal operation. The Coroner
immediately took possession of the corpse,
and an autopsy was held by Acting Au
topsy Surgeon Dr. Caglieri, who found
that' the death of Mrs. Plate had been
caused by peritonitis, probably following
a criminal operation.
An inquest will be held and the police
have been notified.
RAILWAYS MAY DIVIDE
CALIFORNIA BUSINESS
Rumors of a Conference Between
Southern Pacific and
Santa Fe.
NEW YORK, July 17.â Several officials
of the Southern Pacific and the Atchison,
Topeka and Santa Fe Railway systems

several other officers of the former ar
rived on Saturday; Paul Morton, first vice
president of the Santa Fe road, came to
day, and President Ripley Is expected to
morrow. '- â â â¢ â â¢'_ .â . _.
While the officials will not discuss the
matter, there is a story that there will bo
a conference between them to-morrow
relative to California business. The Atch
ison Company has. almost completed its
road Into San Francisco, x and it will be
open for business before the end of the
current year. The provisions of the in
terstate commerce law would prevent any
open agreement, but it is hinted that a
scheme to divide California business is to
be arranged.

HUMAN NATURE
BOUND IN RED
Miss Ledyard's Idea of
the Indian.
â * â
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, July 17.â "Indian na
ture is human nature bound in red."
This quotation from a well-known
] writer was included in â a. paper that was
; read this morning by Miss Mary Ledyard,
superintendent of the. Los Angeles kinder
j gartens, before the Indian teachers' con
| vention at the Normal School Auditorium.
, The meeting was opened with prayer by
! the Rev. Mr. Lippincott and a musical
' programme formed a pleasing prelude to :
i the opening session.
Miss Ledyard's paper dwelt upon the
j necessity of placing the little Indian chil
! dren in the kindergartens. She drew at
| tention to the fact that t^ie same degree j
;of advancement could not be expected
I from the Indian child, taken only for a
short time from the reservation, as from
the white child that had been born and
! nurtured under conditions of the highest
civilization. Said she:
It has been said that 'he Indian race is dying
out, but the fact remains that we have 250.
native Americans on our Indian reservations.
Can Indiana understand and appreciate truth?
"By their fruits ye shall know them.'' In one
i year 621 Indians belonging to Congregational
missions in Dakota gave (ISM for carrying the
| Scape] among their own countrymen. At one of
j their last missionary societies they planned to ;
send a missionary to their deadly enemies, the i
Crows.
The people of California should have a spe- ]
i cial Interest In the education and the elevation
I of their Indian neighbors.
Here Miss Ledyard spoke of the ear:y j
i treaties with the red men of America and
of the relation between the red men and
the white men of the West, ami said that
the profit of civilizing the Indian was not
only for the savage, but for the civilized j
man as well.
"The Indian is a creature of appetite."
* she continued, "and is limited by customs
growing out of aboriginal experience
"We change his surroundings and increase
his temptations unless we give nim the
restraining influence of a Christian edu- '
! cation." *
The speaker said that, excepting certain
degraded tribes, the capability of the In
dian to learn civilized ways was beyond \
doubt. Many had taken up land and a
large number paid taxes. At least 180,000 i
i were self-supporting.
Miss Ledyard said that the cost of car
ing for a civilized Indian was much less j
than that of caring for a savage Indian, |
and for that reason alone it paid to edu
cate Indian children. The child, she be- ]
lieved, should be given all possible In- i
struction that would lead it into a life
of brighter civilization. Therefore its edu
cation should begin in the kindergarten,
; so that Its earliest impression might come ,
from the school where the ways of civil- |
ized people were taught.
Miss Estelle Carpenter of San Francisco i
| spoke of the necessity of teaching music :
to children.
"Music," she said, "touches the child's
j nature as nothing else can. It should ;
! be taught for the sake of the control ;
I which it gives over the voice, If for noth- j
ing else."
The conference was divided into sec
tions this afternoon and the different
| studies that are taught at the Indian
I schools" were discussed.
Among the prominent persons seated on i
1 the platform this morning were Commis- 'â¢
sioner Edward A. Allen, superintendent
j of the Indian schools at Albuquerque: C.
I H. Asbury, Major R. H. Pratt of the Car
j lisle School and Dr. Gates, president of \
the Board of Indian Commissioners.
NO CONCESSIONS WILL
BE MADE TO CANADA
Great Britain Under Pressure Is Said
to Have Acted in Bad Faith on
the Boundary Dispute.
NEW YORK.JuIy 17.â A special to -the
Journal from Washington says: The
United States has determined finally to
decline to accede to Great Britain's de
mands for concessions in any territory
now held by the United States, and to ,
insist upon the provisional line suggested
by Secretary Hay, which has heretofore |
been fully set forth.
There is a general feeling in adminis
tration circles that Great Britain, under j
pressure from Canada, has acted in bad
faith, and that Canada's insistence upon
Impossible terms is wholly responsible fur
the failure to agree upon a provisional
line.
Th decision to hold no further sessions
of the commission involves the question
of sending American troops to Pyramid
Harbor, on the Lynn canal, but this will
not be determined until Senator Fair
banks has given the State Department
and the President the benefit of his per
sonal observations. ;

THE RESULT OF A
MOB'S VIOLENCE
ADOLPH I*. REHTELD SUES THE
CITY FOB DAMAGES.
His Saloon on Greenwich and Lyon
Streets Was Destroyed by the
Tennessee Volunteers
Last April.
' ' . i
Th wrecking of the saloon of Adolph
L. Rehfeld at the southeast corner of j
Greenwich and Lyon streets by the Ten
nessee volunteers some months ago haa
not yet been forgotten. Yesterday Reh- '
feld filed suit against the city and county
to recover damages in the sum of $5994 92,
the alleged value of the premises de
stroyed.
The complaint sets forth that on April
16 a mob consisting of 200 men or more '.
attacked his store, totally demolished and
destroyed it and set fire to the building.
Plaintiff alleges that he exercised due
diligence to prevent' the damage to his
property and promptly notified the au- j
thorities, and their failure to protect tho
property lays the city liable for the dam- \
age sustained by him.
On June 24 Rehfeld presented a claim for :
the sum named to the Supervisors. They
rejected the claim, and hence the suit.

Â»
Out of all the rumpus over the shivering
volunteers there rises the fact that the
Oregon troops can get clothing In plenty
if they will appiy for It. There are hun
dreds of overcoats on hand, both in the
regimental headquarters and at the de
partment headquarters, and all the sol
diers have to do is to apply for them. The
trouble Is. however, that the men are
more anxious to save the price of the
overcoat than to keep warm in Govern
ment clothing for the remaining weeks of
their service, and therefore they are not
asking for overcoats. The garments are
allowed the troops at a price of $11 69; if
they do not draw them they will be al
lowed the same amount in money, and the
Government do not allow the men to
draw the overcoat and get the money as
well.
The clothing allowance to each man is a
liberal one. In the first year of his en
listment he is allowed about STS. If he use.
all this he is clothing himself much better
than the average soldier; if he use but a
part of it the balance will be turned over
to him In cash. The Oregon regiment Is
now working upon its allowance for the
second year, and the men all have from
$15 to $20 of their allowance coming to
them. They wish to draw it all In money,
and so they are purchasing civilian over
coats or none at all. They have the mon
ey, for only last Saturday they were paid
for the months of May and June. Before
they are mustered out there will be
another month's pay due them and they
will be given the two months' extra pay
allowed by act of Congress to all troops
serving beyond the limits of the country.
This will make three months' pay. besides
travel allowance, which will amount to
over $30 a man. This travel allowance is
practically a gratuity, for the Government
could save money by transporting the
troops to their home in Oregon and mus
tering them out there, but yielding to the
demands of the men it has decided to
muster them oat here and allow them the
travel allowance. With all this coming to
them there is no one to blame but them
selves if they are not properly clad.
General Summers has the power to or
der his men to provide themselves with
overcoats, but hesitates to do so In view
of the short time the regiment will re
main in the service. The clothing ques
-ion is not one of neglect nor Inattention
nor indifferenceâ lt is a personal one with
the individual soldiers. When the regi
ment arrived at the Presidio it was met
by Colonel Marshal, the department
quartermaster, who informed General
Summers that the men would probably
need warmer clothing and that if they
made application they could have It as
quickly as It could be brought from tne
storehouse in the city: but no applications
have been made. Weeks ago General
Shafter brought the matter to the atten
tion of the authorities at 'Washington
and his answer was that it is against t-*e
law to Issue any clothing to any soldier
without charging it to his clothing ac
count. , __ , _Â_.Â«.
The need of warm clothes is felt by
those on guard more than by any of the
others, and General Summers has noti
fied "his captains that when they detail
a man for guard duty they shall see that
he makes some arrangements with some
one who has an overcoat, so he may bor
row it while exposed on his post. The
guard is a very small one. being merely
for the purpose of preventing violations
of the police rules of the camp, and so
there are plenty of overcoats in the regi
ment to go round. It is the men who
come into town and then ride out to the
post again on the fronts of the cars that
are In most danger. So far. however,
there is no Increase In the sick list.
The Spring Valley Water Company
placed the Government upon its list of
customers yesterday and hereafter it will
draw a fat monthly bill from Uncle Sam.
The water question has been one over
which the authorities at the post have
been worrying themselves for some time.
The reservoir has been lowering steadily
and the pumps have all been going full
power, while the wells they drew from
have been failing. It was found that
something had to be done, and yesterday
the matter was settled by connecting *.ie
post main to the Spring Valley service.
The post has now nearly 6000 men quar
tered ln Its various camps and barracks,
and they have been using nearly 250.000
gallons "of water a day. Both the post
buildings and the camps have been kept
supplied from the Presidio reservoir, but
now only the camps are so supplied. The
head of the Spring Valley main does not
give pressure enough at the camps, so
they still draw from the reservoir; but
lower down among the buildings the
Spring Valley service is all that will here
after he used.
The Nineteenth United States Infantry
will arrive here about July 22 and two
battalions of It will go directly on board

recruits, will make the transport's load.
The Ohio and Newport are booked to sail
on the 25th Inst., but their allotments
have not yet been made.

acid. Eaton saw her try to swallow the
stuff and stopped her before she had done
more than burn her mouth. The affair

a sensation. The young lady has been

VANCOUVER, B. C. . July IT.â peculiar accident occurred on Sunday
night on the line of the Canadian Pacific Railway. The scene was in the
Rocky Mountains, where the mountains are thousands of feet high and ra
vines and gulches hundreds of feet deep. William Honey, watchman for the
railway, discovered late in the evening that the bridge across Cherry Creek
nearKamloops had been burned, and there was a gap of 150 feet unbridged. It
was nearly time for the imperial limited to arrive from Vancouver, and the
watchman was at a loss to know how to stop her and avoid a disaster. Im
mediately after the limited express there was the excursion train of the Na
tional Editorial Association, which was delayed thirty hours by the accident.
Honey realized that prompt action was necessary. and. all alone, he walked
into the swift running current and swam across. By the time be was half
way across he was nearly benumbed by the cold water of the lake, which runs
from the glaciers in the mountain crevices above, but. badly exhausted, he at
last landed safely and climbed up to the railway track again. He flagged the
train in plenty of time, and the editors were back several miles, safe in their
cars', when the alarm was given to them. They were kept there until this after-

train, who will present him with a watch. He will be rewarded by the com

SAN JOSE, July 17.â Mayor Martin pre

Council this afternoon. It shows the
city's finances in a better condition than
for some time past. The running ex
penses of the city for the year were $39.
--841 11. less than last year. The message
states if this economical administration
Is carried on, the cash basis fund will be
sufficient to place the city on a. cash basis
three years hence, instead of ten years,
as the charter provides.
Sufficient money is on hand for the
School Department to carry on the pri
mary and grammar schools until the
money of the levy intended for the year
_!Â»_# and 1900 has been collected and turned
Into the treasury.
Mayor Martin is convinced the city
should own its own lisrhting plant. He

to erect an electric light plant, as the
company organized to utilize the water
power of Blue Lakes for cities and towns
about San Francisco will lay wires
through San Jose and a satisfactory con
tract for power could probably be made
with them.

CHICAGO, July 17.â Mayor Carter H.

ter to the committee in charge of ar
rangements for the Democratic meet
ing at the Auditorium on July 20:
\ W. P. Cooling Esq.. Chairman Commit
tee of Arrangementsâ Dear Sir: Replvlng
to your favor of the Uth inst.. In which
you ask me to deliver an address of we;,
come at the Auditorium on July 20 to the
National Democratic Committee and a
large number of prominent Democrats of
America. I regret my inability to accept.
In ordinary circumstances I should be
only too glad, both as Mayor of Chicago
and as a Democrat, to welcome thÂ» I a
tional committee, or any number of Dem
ocrats to Chicago, the city in which ths
platform of IS'"*; was framed and in which
v.. J. Bryan was elevated to his present
leadership of the National Democracy. I
cannot but think, however. It would be
an absurdity to welcome these distin
guished men under the ausnices of a self:
constituted committee, whose personnel is
too. obscure to be known even In its home
city. Had this me- ting been organized
under the direction of Democrats of thÂ«
regular type and know:: party standing it
would have afforded me great pleasure
to be presnt. In the existing circum
stances, while thanking you for the hon
or. I must beg leave to be excused. Tours
respectfully.
CARTER H. HARRISON.
"When a copy of Mayor Harrison's
letter was shown to ex-Governor Alt
geld, he said:
"I am sorry the Mayor looked at it
that way. He has made a grave mis
take. He has lost a golden opportun
ity. Should he come to the meeting
; and make a rousing Democratic speech
! he would place himself at the head of
the Democratic party of the State. But
'he has lost the chance now. lam sorry
! fur it."
When Mr. Cooling read the Mayor's
letter he made the following statement:
"We have given the young man in
\ the City Hall the opportunity of his
i life, which he has failed to appreciate.
There is a tide in the affairs of men,
which, taken in the flood, leads on to
: fortune. The son of Carter Harrison

with it then may be a startling story to
For the last five years of her time
the woman was 'he wife of Max Looria,
a tailor .it least tin years her junior. They
resided with her daughter by a former
marriage, Mary Rosenthal, at 190 Shipley
t etreet. On Thursday, May 19, Mrs. Looria.
who had often expressed an intention of
making a will, announced in the home cir- j
cle that sh>? was going that afternoon to
her lawyer to do so. it being her deter- j
mination to bequeath the $3000 In bank, i
that amount being the remainder of the
turn she had when she married Looria.
This announcement. it is said, caused a
quarrel in the house, the husband claim
ing that he was entitled to as much con ]
Blderation as the daughter. The upshot ;
was that Mrs. Looria concluded not to
make her will that day. but to do so the i
following Monday. With this Idea in j
â¢mind she sent for Mrs. A. Davis, a neigh- I
bor residing at I*> 6 Shipley street, asking
that lady to accompany her Monday on
that errand. Mrs. Davis consented.
â â ' The next day. Friday, Mrs. Looria, who
had always been a hard-working woman,
-went about her work as usual and in the
evening went to market, returning to eat .
her usual supper. At 10 â¢Sock that night
she retired; having complained previous
ly of a burning sensation in her stomach, j
accompanied by a consuming thirst. She
became rapidly worse, and at midnight J
she requested that Mrs. Davis be sent for. i
"1 am dying, the woman said when her
neighbor 'arrived. '.'I know I'm .lying."
Mrs. Davis laughed "at her fears and pro
ceeded to do what she could to assuage
the suffering. She noticed that Mrs.
Looria's feet were becoming cold, and 'she
applied mustard plasters and rubbed the j
dying woman, in the hope of increasing \
the circulation.
Mrs. Davis concluded finally that a phy- !
sician must be called. Site instructed |
Mary Rosenthal to run out and get the
first one she could find. This happened
to be Dr. Margaret Mahoney of '."''. , How
ard street, who hurried at once to the
sick woman's side.
Dr. Maho reached the house within I
a few minutes of 2 o'clock. Mrs. Looria i
died at 4730 o'clock Saturday morning. As
Dr. Mahoney had not been in attendance
on the sick woman a sufficient length of i
time to diagnose the case, she refused to ,
give a certificate stating the cause of
death. She, did. however, give Looria a
note to the Coroner. It read as follows:

Although the physician who attended Mrs. Fannie Looria refused to sign a death certificate. Dr. John R. Mc-
Murdo, who never saw the deceased, filled out the blank and pocketed a fee.
Induced, In my opinion, Ny indigestion. I i
treated her for two hours, hut without
success, and she died. Thereupon, at the I
suggestion of a relative and knowing that j
I could not sign a certificate of death,
not having been in attendance for twenty
four hours, l addressed a communication
to the Coroner, sotting forth th*' facts of
the case and asking that a countersign
certliieate be Issued. This note was taken,
I presumed, to the Coroner, but on inves
tigation I found that It had been taken
to Dr. McMurdo and that he signed the
certificate on the statement intended for
the ostruction of the Coroner. How the
matter was arranged I do not know, but I
as mv connection with the matter is above |
comment I will allow the officials to set
tle the matter of the certificate among
'themselves."
In other words, in writing that note
Dr. Mahoney meant that the Coroner
should be notified of th* case. That was
two months ago, but up to yesterday he
had not beard of It. Looria did not take
the note to the Coroner or have it taken
there. It did find Its way during the af
ternoon of the day of his wife's death
to the hands of Dr. John It McMurdo.
assistant city physician, who has an office
In the Spring Valley building. A man
from 'an undertaking establishment and
A. Leszynsky, sexton of the synagague at
Post and Taylor streets, to whom Looria
had confided the arrangements for the fu
neral, presented the note to McMurdo.
They requested a death certificate and Dr.
McMurdo signed one without having at
tended the woman, in face of the refusal
'of the physician who had, and pocketed
a fee therefor. â¢ *..-â 
"I recollect the case quite well," says
âDr. McMurdo'. "Undertaker Gray's man
"and a representative of the Jewish Syna
gogue at Taylor and Post streets called
at my office and requested me to sign the
I death certificate. As Assistant City Phy
sician 1 am often called upon to do this
in cases where there is absolutely no
doubt about the cause of death and where
I th*- parties are reliable. The man who
accompanied Gray's man was the sexton
lof the synagogue. I have forgotten his
name. They presented me with a letter
from Mrs. Or. Mahoney. stating that the
deceased had died from natural causes.
This letter was addressed to the Coroner.
cording to my usual custom, I always
modify the death certificate when parties j
call upon me to sign it in cases where !
death occurs without a physician having ]
l*een in attendance within the time pre
scribed by law."
No matter how suddenly or from what
cause Mrs. Looria died and notwithstand- ]
ing th*- refusal of the attending physician j
to sign a certificate, a physician was
found who claims that right and who ex
erclsed it. The body was embalmed. in
the face of the fact that the Coroner
should have been notified and should have |
had an opportunity to hold an autopsy
before all likelihood of determining the j
real cause of death had been effaced by
the injection of embalming fluid into the
system.
tificate was not the only thing irregular
about it. The dead woman's age was not j
stated correctly by ten years. Her sister,
Mrs. i. Samuels, who resides with her
husband at 1103 Howard street, says that
Mrs. Looria was 60 years of age- not 71,
as noted in the certificate. This error, if;
made designedly, could have been made ;
with no other purpose than to deceive In
vestigators Into the belief that the wo
man nad succumbed to old age more than
any other cause.
At any rate, it was one of the circum- ;
stances tlfat made Mrs. Samuels suspi
cious, and she protested to Looria against
haste In burying his wife. She says she
told him she didn't like it.
"My sister died so suddenly," she says
now. "that I did not think she should be
buried without an investigation."
Mr. Samuels also made objection to the
burial on the heels of death. He claims
now that Looria answered this objection
by telling him to keep quiet and "what
ever 1 gx+i. you get half.'
After the funeral. Samuels says he re
minded the widower of his promise.
"Do you remember," said the- brother
in-law, "that you said 1 should get half?"
ii. said that Looria disclaimed having
made any such statement, but did finally
say. In the presence of witnesses, that
he would give him $50, which other state
ment, Samuels now says, Looria also re
pudiates.
There are two people who claim they
are entitled to benefit by Mrs. Looria's
death. Both put in their claims early.
"Half of the money my wife left lc
mine.'' says Looria. "The other ha be
longs to my wife's daughter. She say* it
doesn't, but I know better. Half of it is
mine and the rest is hers. Others claim i
some of the money, but they can't have
it. They have no claim; they have no
right to it. It is mineâ half of it, 1 meanâ j
and i will get it."
The daughter, who still resides In the
house with her father, thinks differently.
She has sail! SO to his face.
"It's all mine," she told him not long |
ago in the presence of others. "Mother
said It was for me, because 1 am a sickly '
girl."
Notwithstanding this difference of opin- :
lon concerning the dead woman's money,
the two reside together, the girl, who is '
not particularly strong-minded, being
generally silent concerning her claim in
the presence of her stepfather, who is be- .
lieved to exercise a strong influence over
her.
Nobody so far has received a cent of the j
dead woman's money, although among,
other claimants for portions of it is A. Sam
uels, son of I. Samuels, the dead woman's
nephew, for whom she had often said she i
would make provision in her will. Two
days after the funeral three petitions were
filed for letters of administration of the
estate of Mrs. Looria, one by the Public
Administrator, one by the husband and
one by Theodore T. Rosenthal. The peti
tions were heard June 16, before Judge
Coffey. Rosenthal's was granted, and he j
is now administrator. It is more probable,
Judging from the irregularities In the
burial alluded to, that the sister and i
nephew of the deceased may join in a :
contest of any claim Looria may advance ;
to a share of the estate, and to that end
call upon the Coroner to investigate the
death and burial. Whether they do or |
not. the circumstances surrounding the
death, when coupled with the irregularity |
in the death certificate and the hasty j
burial, seem to call for some show of of- j
ficial activity.

THE CAKEWALK CARNIVAL
MAKES FUN FOR THOUSANDS
SOME OF THE STELLAR ATTRACTIONS.
THE cakewalk carnival in Me
chanics' Pavilion drew another
big audience last night, as large
if not larger than that which
swarmed into the place on Satur
day night. It was Oregon night, and
the famous regiment of volunteers
from the Webfoot State was well rep
resented. The entrance of General
Summers was the signal for three
rousing cheers in honor of the Philip
pine veterans and their commander,
and then the entire audience arose as
the band played "The Star-Spangled
Banner."
The opening pageant, with all the
cakewalk artists In line, was enthu
siastically received. Two freaks got
ords, made a visit of Inspection to the
Hall of Justice yesterday afternoon with
two representatives of the contractors for
furnishing th*. building with office fix
tures, etc.. for the pur-pose of giving in
structions as to the locations of counters,
shelves, desks, etc. The looms assigned
to the Chief and his staff are large, airy
and well lighted, but the party expressed
much dissatisfaction because of the lack
of stationary washbasins.
Dr. Farnum's "Subject."
Last Saturday complaint was made to
the police that Dr. C. S. Farntim, the
well-known physician and surgeon, had
on his premises at 2536 Market street the
body of a human being, the presence of
which offended the neighbors. Dr. Far
num is the demonstrator at Cooper Mcd
ical College, and he took a well preserved
body from that institution to his home in
order to make such scientific research as
his much occupied time would permit. In
a number of the newspaper accounts of
the complaint and the result thereof the
statement was made that the body was
taken to the doctor's "house." Dr. Far
num has written an open letter to the
public in which he states that the body
was not in his house, but that it was kept
in the barn, some distance from his hab
itation.

Presented With a Punch Bowl.
Professor A. S. Downing, who is man-
aging one of the excursion parties con
nected with the National Education Asso
ciation, was presented with a handsome
cutglass punchbowl, two dozen glasses
and a silver ladle last night in the parlors
of the California Hotel.
D. E. Ainsworth, Deputy State Superin
tendent of Public Instruction of New
York, made the presentation speech on be
half of 117 delegates. Mr. Ainsworth re
ferred to the fact that Mr. Downing had
managed the Itinerary of the party with
consummate skill, and that those under
his charge had felt it incumbent to mani
fest a substantial expression of their es
teem and gratitude. Mr. Downing re
sponded feelingly, and the gathering spent
the remainder of the evening in social
converse. Mr. Downing is principal of the
New York City Training School for

Attorneys' Row Re
sults in a Shooting.
â â¦ â
RUEF & PERRY'S MAN VICTIM
â Â» â â¢
TWO SETS OF GUARDIANS FOR
DISPUTED PROPERTY.
â¦-
Litigation over property at 772 Commer
rial street caused a shooting scrape about
10 o'clock last evening. G. T. Smith, a
watchman employed by Ruef & Perry, at
torneys, was shot in th*- arm by a cripple
employed by Attorney L. C. Pistoles! in
the same capacity. His injuries are not
serious and the party who did the shoot-
Ing is still at large. The police are in
vestigating the case and officers are look
ing for Plstolesi's watchman, William
Reid, who is a brother-in-law of Pisto
lesi.
Trouble has been brewing between the
litigants for some time. About a week
ago three watchmen who were employed
by Ruef & Perry were arrested on a
charge of burglary sworn to by Attorney
Pistolesi. when they attempted to enter
the building over which the suit has been
brought. The latter attorney has had a
watchman on the grounds for some time,
and be seems to be holding the fort. The
arrested men were brought to the Cali
fornia street station and later into court,
where the charge against them was re
duced and they were liberated on bonds
of $100 apiece. Their cases are still pend
ing-
Last night Joe Demartlni and Jim Mc-
Caffery, two of the men previously em
ployed and who were arrested, went in
company with G. T. Smith to the scene
of the trouble. They claim to have been
sent by Ruef. and were told to take
charge of the place. [When they arrived
Pistolesi's watchman was standing out
side the door. They entered and were
told to leave the place. -Instead of going
they asserted their right to remain, and
after a few words the watchman raised
a rifle and fired. The shot struck Smith
and the shooter rushed inside. Smith
companion, enraged, seised the party with
the rifle and threw him outside, and re
mained in charge until the appearance
of Officers Herri ii, Lyons and Cavanaugh,
who were attracted by the shot.
When a search was made for the
watchman he could not be found, but the
police are making every effort to dis
cover his whereabouts. The trio who
composed Ruef's guardians of the prop
erty -were taken to the California street
station and later to the Central station,
where they will be held penuing the ar
rest of their assailant:
The wounded man refuses to affirm or
deny that Reid did the shooting, but the
others declare that Pistolesi's .watchman
used the gun. Reid lives with his people
on Filbert street, between Hyde and
Leavenworth streets, but he, has not re
turned to his home since the shooting,
and at a late hour last night. the police
were still looking for him.
Shortly before 3 o'clock this morning
Reid appeared at Pistolesi's offlce some
what battered up. He acknowledged the
shooting, but said it was done in self-de
fense. - ' - â¢ _?._'Â»â >_
Hoodlums in the Mission.
The attention of Captain Gillin of the
Seventeenth-street station has been called
to several gangs of. street-corner hood
lums who congregate about the grocery
stores in the remote parts of the Mission
and make it a portion of their pastime
i to annoy respectable ladies and young
: girls who pass by. Last night Sergeant
Blank detailed four officers in citizen's
clothes to corral as many: of the gang as
I they could find. The raid -was not as pro
ductive as was expected, because the tip
had gone out from some of the gang, who
saw the officers on their way to Bryant
and Nineteenth streets, yet three were
caught on the first drag. Others of the
band will bo gathered in from time â¢to
time until the nuisance becomes abated.
An Insane Physician.
A well-dressed man was found wander
ing aimlessly around Laurel Hill Ceme
tery yesterday morning by Policemen
Byrne and Butler. As he appeared to be
out of his mind, the officers sent him in
the patrol wagon to the insane ward in
the Receiving Hospital. From papers In
his possession it was discovered that he
was Dr. C. W. Helms of Sanger. Fresno
County. He was examined by the Insan
ity Commissioners and ordered sent to

There is no questioning the fact that
the carnival is a decided success, but
if the management would make the

would be appreciated by the audience.

LITTLE FRANK, THE
DWARF, EALLS DEAD
THE evil that men do lives after them; the good is oft interred with their
bones." Perhaps some good will lie beneath the dust with the little body
of Frank M. Hoyt, whose dwarfed frame and furrowed face have long
been familiar to the people of this city; but no evil will survive him,
save the memory of evil nature that made him as he was. Yesterday after
noon Frank, beneath whoso feet almost 51 years have rolled, but who has
ever been known as "the boy," fell dead in the cellar of Baccus' butcher
shop, corner of O'Farrell and Mason streets. A little mystery surrounds his
death. No one suspects foul play, it is true, but whether or not apoplexy or
a fall upon the concrete flooring of the collar was the cause will not be
known until after the autopsy has been held.
Frank, whose diminutive stature, aged but childish face and love of ll
quorâwhen his guardian, .1. C. Locke of 333 O'Farrell street, took his eyes
off himâ have made him famous, was born in Lowell. Mass., July 30, IMS.
With his parents. A. Hoyt. one of San Francisco's old-time policemen, and
Martha C. Hoyt, he came to San Francisco ; prior to iB6O. For years the. lit
tle man and his parents lived on Second street, near Mission, and in the
school of that district Frank was ever present. He could never learn to read
or write, however, and finally the doors of the school were closed against
him, and he took up his life upon the street Notwithstanding his imbecil
ity, he was never late for dinner; neither was he a fashionable late comer
at the theater. The theater was one of his passions, and as his father, of
whom Frank was very proud, always wore a star, the little man also pur
chased one and on the bit of polished metal had free access to the play. He
was familiar with all the old-time players, and for hours would indulge in
reminiscences of Booth, Barrett. McCullough and Mrs. Judah. His memory
was acute, although nature had clouded his mind otherwise; and through
these conversations on old times he gained endless pleasure.
Another one of Frank's accomplishments was his knowledge of the mean
ing of pictures. Each morning he would "read" the newspapers in his own
peculiar style, gaining* a knowledge of current events from the illustrations.
The scene of a man lying beneath a tree, a bottle or revolver, a bench and
an apparently well-kept road, would convey to him a suicide in the park;
and he was but seldom wrong. Again he gained a thorough knowledge of
the events of the late war through the pictures and would converse upon
them, although the printing beneath was to him as Greek to the Filipino.
For several years Frank was a familiar figure at the booths during elec
tion time. Besides doing politics to the best of his ability, he would cast a
vote; but finally,, as he always voted the Republican ticket, some Demo
crat challenged his vote, and as he had been declared incompetent by Judge
Coffey, his political career was at an end.
Frank's first guardian was his uncle. Horatio L. Marshall, who was ap
pointed shortly after the death of the little man's parents. Subsequently
Mr. Locke was appointed to the trust, and with him Frank dwelt in the
house at 333 O'Farrell street. Mr. Marshall was once the owner of this house
prior to the time Mr. Locke moved therein, and Frank never moved out.
For twenty-one years he lived there and was always fond of his home. Next
to his home he was fondest of William D. Badger's Sunday School. Frank
was there every Sunday, and with the children of the neighborhood, although
his hair had long turned gray, he sat and marveled at the history of Christ
ianity. Perhaps Rev. Dr. Badger will say the last prayer over poor Frank's
remains. He is in feeble health, but he will be requested to so officiate, for
to Frank he was the one man on earth. fy- y â¢â¢"Â»'
The end of Frank was a pathetic one. He loft his home shortly after 2
o'clock to go on an errand. A short time later an employe In the butcher
shop where Frank met his death stumbled over his body, It was removed
to the Morgue for examination. Mr. Locke was informed of his sudden
death, and now the surgeon's scalpel must determine the cause.

demand his personal attention.
SHIPJOINERS AND
CARPENTERS AT OUTS
TRADESMEN BELONG TO BOTH
ORGANIZATIONS.
Charges Will Be Preferred Against at
Least Twenty Members of the
Carpenters' Union.
At the meeting of Union 453, Carpenters
and Joiners, last nieht a pretty little row
' between the carpenters' unions and the
* Shlpjolners' Association came to the sur
i face. - - - -
I The regular wage scale of the carpen
ters is $3 for a working day of eight
hours. The shipjoiners charge *4 for a
nine-hour flay. The discovery has recent
ly been made that a number of carpenters
have been putting in spare time as ship
joiners and working nine hours a day In
violation of their obligations as members
of the Carpenters' and Joiners' Union.
Members of the latter body protested
against this procedure, and as a result of
the protest charges of violating their ob
ligations will be filed against a- least
twenty carpenters.
If the case against these members Is
fully proven they will either be expelled
from the union or heavily fined. In case
they are expelled, or resign in preference
to paying the fine, they will not be per
mitted to work on any job where union
men are employed, as the carpenters'
unions have the combined strength of the
Labor and Building Trades Councils to
support them. The Shipjoiners' Associa
tion is not affiliated with either of these
bodies.
The offending members are placed under
a double ban by the organizations of car
penters and joiners. In the first place it is
assumed that they have broken their ob
ligations by working nine hours a day
without special permission; secondly, they
are members of two unions of carpenters,
while they are only permitted by the rules
which th*y have sworn to uphold to re
tain membership in hut one. A thorough
Investigation into the matter will be made,
and it will probably be definitely settled
at the trials of the offending members.
Other business of the union consisted of
the initiation of four new members and
a general discussion regarding the wages
of Government employes
