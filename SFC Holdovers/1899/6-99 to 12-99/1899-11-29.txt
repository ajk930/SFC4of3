HEAVY LOSSES TO BRITISH
IN THE RECENT BATTLES
Latest Lists of Casualties as Submitted by General Buller,
Whose Report Removes the Fear That the <Ninth
Lancers Were Captured by the Boers.
â¢vâ A dispatch has been received here from General Builer giving a list of cas
ualv ps engaged in the battle of Gras Pan, but which is now officially designated as the
batr yes. as anticipated, that ths British success was dearly bought. The losses an
â¢ the naval brig-ade casualties previously noted, make a grind total of 198 as the
â  second battle. The Yorkshires, apparently, bore with the navai brigade the
there were, in addition to three officers, forty-eight of the rank and file killed
wounded
â¢ contains the casualties of the Ninth Lancers seems to dispose of the fears
that the cavalry waa surrounded and captured, especially as none of the Lancers is reported missing.
â¢" casualties shows that among the wounded of the Second Yorkshire Light
Infantry C. A. Yatcs, Lieutenant H. C. Fernyhough and Lieutenant C. H. Ackroyd. The cas
ualties among the non-co::. i officers and men of the various regiments engaged were: Killed, ten

War Office has received the following dispatch from General Buller, dated Pietermaritzbure

â¢â¢A corrected list of the British casualties at Gras Pan shows that Flag Captain Reginald C.

xrounded. were killed."
The additional casualties telegraphed by General Buller appear to be the first intimation of the
:.s of General Methuen's forces which have not yet been reported. As the Ninth Lancers partici
on Sunday, they must have safely returned from the pursuit of the Boers
Â«fter the battle of Gras Pan.

to others praying for the promised re

physical effort*. He made several at

tion were persistently and bitterly oji

the matter had been carried to the Su
preme Court of the State that he secured
nn order to again have his sanity tried
In a I^jjal manner.
Judpe Davis of Marysville, whÂ»n inter
â  . wed In regard t<> the natter, declared
that he had never made any prrmise to
intercede In behalf of Buchanan. H<
ridded he would never consent to have the
charge stricken from the calendar of his
court, as it would be of no avail to do so
If Buchanan continued in!Â«ane. while if
he v,-*re far.o hÂ« should certainly be made
to stand trial for murder.
Dl.-trict Attorney E. P. McDanlel is

of Mi'.es. and has always been sane. !â¢>

What h* did agreo to was to consent to
tils relt-ase if at th* end of a year he was
found to be still insane. H* admits that
i report on Huchanan's condition was

>f the case McDaniel said:
"It was ono of t!ie m^st artistically
manufactured defenses of insanity that I
have any k::owledRÂ»Â» of."
At the time of the trial of Hush Bu

lady from which the defendant was suf

9f this mental disease ar* that the brain
tissue gradually decays, the patient's con
dition becomes rapidly worse and soon
death ensues. So far as any of the at
taches of th- p.sylum can see, the mental
condition of Buchanan has not changed
since the day of his Incarceration.
It is customary to make a record in
the books of the institution of each case
when the patient is brought to the asy
lum. In the case of Buchanan the cause
of his alleged insanity is ;rtven as "un
known." and the same entry- is made
aKalnst the "class of insanity."
Dr. Gardner has always claimM that
Buchanan is unfit to be at larpe. as he
might suddenly develop symptoms and
tendencies that would make him a men
ace to human life. When asked if he
had received any compensation for his
veryfees in the Burhanan case, when it
waa on trial at Marysville. or if he had
received any part of the fcÂ£W previously
mentioned, he dÂ»-c!in<*d to answer, sayinj;

TO STRIKE VIGOROUS BLOWS

Be in Progress.
MOVEMENT hOR THE RELIEF OF LADVS.nIIH.

BERLIN, Nov. 28â T^c Deutsche Zeituog publishes the followiog
dispatch, dated Pretoria, November 27, received through Boer diplo
matic channels:
â¢President Kruger and President Steyn bave instructed General
Joubert and General Cronje not to split their forces into small detach
ments, but to striKe vigorous biows. General Joubert has three corps,
one Voiding Ladysmith, tY)e second commanding the Tugela and the
th)ird east of Estcourt, in order to cut off the British retreat. General
Cronje's forces are divided into three contingents, one at KÂ«mberley,
another at Modder River and the third in tbe rear of General Methuen. "
LONDON. Nov. 29.â The dearth of
war n^ws. due to a breakdown of
the East Coast cable and the activ
ity of the censor. Is most pro
nounced this morning. No newspa
per specials have come through
since Monday night. Last night the War
Office received two dispatches from Cape
Town of the same date, one of which was
very important. It stated that a tele
graph line was established Monday night
hs far north as Klokfontein. which is a
small station on the railway !ln>\ eight
ml!*s short of Modd*>r River and about
thirty-two miles from Klmberley. As the
telegraph always follows and does not
precede the army. Lord Methuen's force
should by this time have reached Modder
River and very possibly have fought an
other big battle.
A- confirming the supposition that
J Methutn is following the retreating Boers '
closely. Is the other Cape Town dispatch, '
giving the names of an officer and a pri
vate of the Ninth Lancers who were
wounded in a reconnoissance on Sunday
j after the battle at Gras Pan.
Lord Methuen yesterday probably
reached Modder River without opposition.
While It is not expected that the Boers
will ike a star.d on this side of the river,
they are sure to dispute his passage or
; make one last grand stand at - â¢ ntein.
Apparently the main body is finding It
necessary to reinforce their comrades,
whom General M*>thuen has been pushing
back. It la known that General Cronje,
who left the front at Kimberley early last
week, led the BoÂ«r forces at Gran Pan.
Ladysmith haa reported that all was
well there up to November 24. but the re
lief of that besieged town is not going to
be accomplished in a few days. British
scouts appear to have lost touch with the
enemy, who. when last seen, w^re falling
back t. Â»arl â¢ olenso. At Tut?ela River
it is probable a fight will or. jr. Should
thp bridge there be destroyed, as is DMMt
probable, General Clery may push his ln
: a spot some distance east
Of the town. Here the river line pr
a. f â rma.tion obviously favorat > to an ad
. - it p-rmits a crossfire being
brought on the ground which the Boers
wi>u!d b* compelled to occupy.
Kimberley reports that the Boers are
marching to the south. It is not stated
whether this dispatch was forwarded
through General Methuen's advance, but
everything points to the Boers making
ready to give the British a warm recep
tion in the vicinity of the Ifodder River.
Nothing has been received regarding
the movements of General Clery's col
umn, which was at Frere on Sunday, or
those of Joubm, who was falling back
toward Colenso. If the Boers Intend to
make a stand there the two armies should
be within striking distance by this time.
General Gatacre has occupied Bush
men's Huek. a f*w miles fr ,m Molteno
anÂ»l Just south of Stormberg Junction.
the Boers are in force. Fighting
there Is imminent. Gatacre's force may
be slow in beginning operations. The
(â â¢i.r.try in which it has to work is ex
cessively difficult and most favorable to
Boer tactics. Mountains covered with
bowlders, an admirable shelter Cor
marksman, and river bÂ«ds. offering ex.
ceptional opportunities for ambushesâ
this is the nature of the ground.
e:Kht"Â«-n miles from Burghersdorp to
St.rmberjf. and for more than half the

;eclivitles. There is a deep railway
rutting, which could bÂ« effec tlveiy blocked
by dropping a few big rocks.

masses of Indurated limestone, with few
passes and many precipices. The height
at Stormberpr Junction Railway station Is

Incidents in the Encounter That May Cause McDonnell's Death.
MURDER WAS INTENDED;
THE MOTIVE A MYSTERY
Man Known as "Larry" Accused
of McDonnell Stabbing.
Injured Man Tells the Story of the As
sault That May Result in His
Death.
SOMK light has broken through the '
der.re mystery â¢. â â¢ clouded thÂ» ;
stabbing of William McDnn- j
nell, the marine nr*-man. That '
the case is not one of attempted
suicide is now certain, and but little doubt !
remains that It waa a dellhorate and bru-
Uli attempt at murder. The motive for j
the crime is still unexplained, but the sur- |
rounding circumstances would indicate
that It was an attempt to wip.- out an old
grudge or an effort to block McDonnell in
his endeavors to secure a position as a
fireman on the steamer Noyo.
McDonnell la still firm in his determina
tion to shield his assailant. He has kÂ»pt
from the police any clew that might lead i
to the arrest of the guilty party. He has!
confided a portion of his secret, however, I
to his sister-in-law. Mrs. Lizzie McDon- â¢
nell of 223 Second street. The information
he imparted to her was given shortly
after he was taken to the Receiving Hos
pital, at a time when he did not expect to j
survive the horrible wounds that had j
been inflicted upon him. There was no j
object for him to deceive hi* siater-ln-law. j
and she believes that the story he told her !
is the true version of his terrible experi- 1
ences.
He stated to her that the man who cut
him w:is named "Larry." and was a ma- j
rine fireman who fre'jutnted the saloon at |
the corner of Second and Tehama streets. I
He had met this mysterious "Larry" dur- J
ing his recent voyage to Alaska. They
bad had seme trouble up north, but when '
they met again in this city the difficulty j
was apparently forgotten, and they wtre
frequently seen in each other's company.
Last Sunday night McDonnell went
about the neighborhood of Second and
Tehama streets, paying a number of bills. ,
and displayed considerable money. In his :
rounds he met "Larry," who went with j
him to the Welcome saloon- The pair j
stayed there until after midnight, when
they wandered out into the darkness. Ac
cording to the statements made by Mc-
Donnell to his sister-in-law, hÂ« and
"Lurry" continued their carousal at vari- [
ous resorts until after, daylight, when they .
reached the vicinity of Sixth and Berry j
streets. McDonnell remembered that ha
had an appointment on board the Noyo,
where he had been promised employment
as a tire man.
He started for the vessel through the
lumber piles In the vicinity, and 'â¢Larry" '
followed. When they were hidden from
the view of people passing along thÂ»; !
streets "Larry" mentioned the trouble j
they had had up north. One word brought I
on another until the men clinched, and
during the tussle "Larry" whipped out a
dirk knife and plunged it into McDonnell's i
throat and body. The latter fell to the
ground, and his assailant disappeared
among the plies of lumber.
McDonnell regained consciousness some ,
time later and managed to sum up j
strength enough to drag himself through ;
the lumber yards to where he was found
by Special Officer Ryan.
"My brother-in-law returned from the j
north about a week ago." said Mrs. Mc-
Donnell yesterday, "and has been stop
ping at my house most of the time since
his arrival. I visited him at the Recelv- I
ing Hospital within an hour after he had j
been taken there Monday. At that time .
he thought that his wounds would prove '
fatal, and told me the story of the assault
as best he could In his condition. He men
tioned a man whom he called 'Larry' as
the one who had stabbed him. I asked
l.irn for the man's last name, and under- j
stood him to say something that sounded
like Porter or Potter, but as to this I .ira
not very positive. I am sure, however,
that what William Cold me was the truth. '
I asked him If he had told everything to
the detectives, and he replied that he had.
"I was very much surprised when 1
learned that the police had reached the
conclusion that William's wounds were j
self-inflicted. He had no rr-ason for wish- '
ing to commit suicide. He was of a '

Dr. DozU-r. HrM assistant physician, was
railed to the Hand as a nrltneu for Buch
anan. He testified thai, when Buchanan
first came to the asylum In liM he was
jilaced In Ward J, which vrxa under his
especial sujHTViMon.'l-ater li.'chanan was
transferred to Ward D, \\ here he fre
quently haw and converged with him.
About two yean ago. witness tcFtilSed. he
was transferred to. the fetnalo side of the
lnMltuticn and m lost all t-iuch with
Buchanan. When astked as to Buchanan's
mental condition the witness created a
â enMtlon by statins that at no time had
he KJfcn the Â»-lightest rymptoms or evi
dences of an abnormal state of mind or
of epilepsy In Buchaosn; that the latter
had comported him*Â»-lf quietly and ration
ally and cheerfully. Withers recalled that
the fc'tate Lui.acy Commission o:ieÂ« asked
for a nummary of the history of each p<i
tlent in the Institution, and in this sum
mary tho question was asked:

Thlh. In Huchanan's case, the witness
did not aiiswer, but referred It to Dr.
Gardner.
Upon cross-examination Dr. Dozler said
that he couldn't tell Just how long after
Duchanan's Incarceration In the uxylum
lie arrived Mt the conclusion that Ltuchunan
was .sane, but that hit* opinion had been
formed from day-to-day Impressions. He
admltw-d that ho knew nothing of Uu
chaqan's history before Ljchanan came
to the aFjlum. and said that In corao cueÂ« s
It wus quite posMblÂ« for such men m Dr.
Gardner and himself to honestly differ.
When asked why. if he considered Bu
chanan sane, he had not recommended his
ujM-hanro from tho Institution, the wit
ness replied that he had not because of
circumstances. _ .
Mr. Llvfrnanh wanted to hear the cir

There Is no loncer any question as to

BALFOUR SPEAKS OF THE
DUTCH DREAM OF EMPIRE
JXSNDON. Nov. -Arthur J. Balfour.
| Government leader of the House of Com
mons, addressing the National Conserva
tive Conference at Dewsbury to-day, re
pelled the charge that the Government's
motive In the war In South Africa was
| the acquisition of the sold fields. He asked
I If. during the last hundred years, any
j British statesmen had dreamed of taxing
the colonies for the benefit of the mother
country. Britishers were row sacrificing
the lives of those dearest to them, he r.s
â¢ sorted, for the Fake of the security and
honor of the empire. The first acts of
I the drama wen* being played in Cape Col
( ony and Natal, but the denouement would
be played, he trusted, in dominions not
1 now subject to the crown. (Cheers.)
"I have now come to the conclusion."
he said, "that the declaration of war by
the Transvaal and the Free State was
j not only a despairing struggle for lib
erty, but a bold bid for empiresâ n bid to
make themselves the, nucleus of a Dutch
speaking paramount power la South Af
rica, and to exclude forever the hated
; Britisher from a dominating influence in
that part of the world, and It is Incredi
ble that such a risk would be run merely
to prevent the I 'it lander getting a vote.
Their dream may be madness, but It is
intelligent madness, when we consider the
whole situation and the military difficul
tly that beset Great Britain in a South
African war. They have vainly counted
on the British party system, and another
reason may be found in their profound
contempt for British arms."
In the course of his *{M â¢dl he said: -
"May we not on this occasion express
our gratitude to our American friends

At the afternoon session Professor
Burk again aroused much interest by
his vigorous discussion of "literature in

teacher?. Professor Burk delivered bis
fan-well address, choosing for his theme.

most entertaining of his series of ad
dresses.
"How to Do Thirty-two Hours' Work

Self-help versus Teachers' Help" was
presented by Miss Flna. A general and

i will surely result. Such conditions emphasize
I the necessity for a standard of value which
| shrill remain firm throughout the vicissitudes of
competitive trade. Its permanency and stability
I should be above suspicion. Its security should
be absolute.
The fact is pointed out that the treas
ury at the beginning of October had a
net gold reserve of more than $250,000,000
and that there is more gold In the United
I States than ever before. The advantages
; which this situation creates are thus de
scribed:
The present conditions are most favorable,
and the time most opportune, fur the clear and
! unequivocal adoption of th- gold standard.
If under all these, conditions the United
States shall clearly, by law. adopt the gold
standard. it will pass to the new condition I
! with even less friction than was experienced
by the resumption of specie payments. The
â  Government Is fortunate In being able to act
! in so importftiit a matter under such favorable
1 circumstances. The general policy of the Gov
ernment and such declarations as have !-â â¢ â 
made by Congress, are entirely consistent with
this proposition.
Mr. Overstreet quotes the pledge of the \
Republican National Convention of 1593
that "all our silver and paper currency
mast be maintained at parity with gold,
and Â»>â  favor all measures designed to
maintain inviolable the obligations of the
United States, and all our money, whether i
coin or paper, at the present standard,
the Standard of the most enlightened na- !
tions of the earth."
The repeated declarations of President 1
McKinley also are quoted, including his
famous speech in New York at the begin
ning of laW, in which he declared that the
people purpose in favor of sound money
must be given the vitality of public law
The declaration in the Republican plat
form and the subsequent effort of Presi
dent McKinley relative to an Interna
tional agreement, it is declared, were
made in good faith, but the attitude of
the leading nations and the constant fluc
tuations in the value .if silver bullion ren
der such an agreement permanently im
possible. The mechanism of the new di
vision of issue and redemption Is ex
plained and it is declared that the differ
ent funds referred to such a division as
they stood in September last are as fol
lows:
L Gold coin and hullion, represented by out
standlng r<<i-i <>-rttncÂ«t-s, $im.."oi.iiÂ»

4. Silver bullion, represented by outstanding
Treanury notes. V'l.l'.T.L'-"
,5. Gold coin and bullion, equal to one-fourth
of the United States (1346.e5i.416) and Treasury
notes (J?1.1Â«7.:>u) outstanding. IK/J.4G2.074.
The first four items enumerate the spe
cial deposits dedicated to specific pay
ments As these obligations are met the
deposits are correspondingly reduced.
The scope and purpose of the provisions
for maintaining the standard by the sale
of boo and the exchange of money are
thus set forth by Mr. Overstreet:
In the absence of a law providing protection
to the sold reserve, It Is always subject to en
croachment In expenditures to meet the general
expenses of the Government. Whenever Â»uch
encroachment appeant probable, a fear has
arisen that the Government may not .be able
to meet its demand obligations, and a run upon
the reserve for the redemption of the demand
notes has followed.. Thin situation is r-:<iÂ»i*M
ble for thÂ» so-called "endless chain." By *ep
aratlnr the reserve fund from the general fund,
and prohibiting Its use except for redemption
of United States and Treasury notes, the dan-
KerÃ to which It has been often subjected would
M removed. The demand notes are redeemed
In gold now, and always have been, and no ad
ditional burden Is Imposed upon the Govern
ment. It Is sought to simplify and le^allte the
practice and create a division In the Treasury
where the whole business of liuiulnft and re
deeming notes may be transacted and estab
lish complete confidence In the redemption of
our demand obligations.
Section 4 of the bill seems to provlda a com
plete eafejruard to guaranty the permanent
maintenance of the gold standard, by author
lzlnjf the Secretary Of the Treasury, whenever
It Is necessary for such maintenance, to Issue
an.l sell bonds of the United States i uyable in
gold coin, and for the exchange of gold coin
for any other money Irsued or coined by the
fnlted^States, should the Secretary of the
Treasury deem such exchange necessary in
order to mulntaln the parity and equal value
of all the money of the United States. The le
galizing of the cold standard and provision
for the equality of all forms of money at a par
ity with the standard will ro remove, all the
doubt Of the soundness and Integrity of our
money that then, will be little occasion for the
exchange of DM kind of money for another.
And yet. In order to make complete guaranty
against any contingency which may arise, au
thorlty to the Secretnry of the Treasury to mcc
such emergencies, should
they arise, by th
sale of bonds or the exchange of any move
UFued or coined by the United States, li> dcerae
advisable.
The provision in this i>ectlon that no note oi
certificate once redeemed or exchanged shall bÂ«
withdrawn, except In exchange for an equiva
lent amount of the coin In which said note oi
certificate was redeemed cr exchanged, will for
ever put an end to the so-called "endless chain"
which has so embarrassed the Oovernme.nt lr
tht- ever- recurring redemption of the green
bock. There can be no contraction of the cur
rency under this system, for the reason thai
either the note Is in circulation, or If re
deemei. its equivalent li In circulation

SWINDLER MILLER
REMAINS AT LARGE
NEW YORK. Nov. 3.â WTlUatn F. Mil
ler, who conducted the Franklin Syndi
cate in Brooklyn. i> still at large.
The Franklin Syndicate safe, which was
locked by Miller the lost thing before he
took fight, was opered by a locksmith
to-day In a Brooklyn police station. In
It was found 190 shares of Brooklyn Rapid
Transit stock and a few worthless scraps
of ; aper. There was r.ot a penny of cash
and nothing of value except the stock. A
majority of it had heen purchased at SS 5 *
ir.i the remainder at Ss\.
Postmaster- Wilson of Brooklyn has rÂ»
ceived an order from the Postmaster Â«Â»en
eral directing him to return, as far as
p> ss:!.>. to the senders all letters a-1
: -Â».-. Â» 0 t n( . syndicate. About l^X* pieces
of mall. inclr:i:riÂ»; over Jl2.'VÂ«) worth of
m<>':^\ orders, have accumulated since
Saturday.
Hubert <Â». Tavler, mho was appointed
receiver "f the syndicate, has asked to
be relieved of the appointment on the
cround that he does not like to have his
i;ame associated in the public mind with
that of Miller and his unsavory sup
porters.
Involuntary bankruptcy proceedings
against the syndicate were Instituted in
the United States Court to-day before
Judge Thomas by attorneys representing
depositors. They allege in the;r petition
that a large part of the syndicate's prop
erty has been concealed with Intent to
d-fraud creditors.

bouched on the plain eastward of the
Boer kooje*. The Boer guns opened fire.
Two batteries of British artillery, post
ed on each side, shelled the Boers, prac
tice being good on both sides. Th-?
Boer* stuck tenaciously to their poÂ«l
tiona firing steadily and accurately.
The dnel. which constantly became hot
ter, lasted three hours. The Boer shells
wounded several men of the naval bri
gade.
Finding It Impossible to displace the
runs by artillery. General Methuen re
solved upon an infantry attack. A
brigade of Infantry. Including the York
shires, the Northampton*, tha Northum

COMPELLED TO ADMIT
"A STATE OF WAR"
LONDON*. Nov. aâ The action of Lord ,
Pauncefote and other British . Embassa- \
dors in notifying the powers that a state
of war has eixstÂ«l since <X-toberllbÂ»Â»twe<Â«n i
Or^it Britain and th- South African re
', publics has prompted inquiries by the j
various London *"mhass!es resraxdins the J
natun* of tho hostiUties.
Th- Associated Pr^^s Is officially In
formed that the notification has in no wise
changed the British views as to the Boers* |
status. In spite of the rfmb!guou* r^f*rÂ« ,
eaces ia the Queen's speech and other of- j
1 fAdal documents at the commencemÂ«nt of j
the war r-K*rdlr.if "military operations'* !
: and other evasion* of the usual term i
â¢ "war" !t appears That the T"nite<] States I
1 has consisten.tly r^coirnlzt^d the BoÂ«>rs as !
1 forming practically an independent stat*. j
considering the claim of British suze- |
rainty too slijtht a thread to put them in j
j the light of rebels.
It ls tacitly admitted by thÂ» British of- I
flcials that thÂ«Â» usual communications rel
ative to "a state of war" wÂ«Â»re not made
earlier becau.=e U was not thought that t
victory would be deferred long enough to
make such a diplomatic step r.^^sary. '
The GÂ«jverr,ment maintains that giving â¢
BoÂ«-rs belligerent rights do*s not constl- j
tute an acknowledsment of their claim i
to independence, evidencing as proof of i
this contention that both foreign Gorern- j
merits and the Government of the United
States treated the Confederates â  > bel
ligerents.

TRANSPORT MANAUENSE
HAS A NARROW ESCAPE
Half-Manned and Leaking She Is
Caught in a Typhoon.
Three Companies of the Thirty-First Infantry Work
Day and Night in the Darkness Without
Proper Food.
MAN Nov. 2S.â The transport
Manaucnse. with Lieutenant Col
onel Webb Hayes and three com
panies of the Thirty-flrst Infan
try oa board, has arrived here.
She narrowly escaped disaster.
The officers and soldiers were for twelve
â !%ys . .... buckets. The steamer
was â  worthy. undermanned anfj
short of provisions. Her engines broke
down and she rolled three days In a ty
phoon.
When thÂ» Manauense anchored In Ma
nila Bay this morning, thirty-three days
from San Francisco, there were several
feet of water in her hold and 400 grimy.
greasy, hungry, exhausted soldiers and
sailors who had bees passing buckets of
water since November 17. r.'.ght and day.
First Assistant Engineer Dur.Wvy was
unJ^r arrest, and according to Colonel
Webb Hayes* official report, the chief en
gineer would have been under arrest also
If there had been any one to replace him.
The colonel's report ail declares that
the captain of the vessel told htm that
the only thing which brought them
through was the fact that the men were
greenhorns and fai!e<l to realize their dan
ger, while experienced sÂ«>iimen would
hare deserted the ship and taken to the
boats In midocean.
The officers say her owners bought her
for $45.0Â«/0. and they claim efforts were
made to sell her to the Government for
Jlju.uw). She started from San Francisco

which carried the remainder of the regi
ment and encountered heavy seas to Ho
nolulu without accident.
After starting it developed that she
was undermanr.ed and soldiers had to be
detailed to act as rtremen. coal passers
and waiters a:id to do other work. Be
fore reaching Honolulu the crew con
cluded that the ship was not safe and
the majority agreed to desert. Though
they were closely .watcht-d. many suc
ceeded in getting away, and the Manau
ense left Honolulu with less than half
h*Â»r crew. The captain of the transport
on November 17 told Colonel Hayes that
the vessel had sprung a leak, and an In
vest iganon rÂ»-sultÂ»-d In tindmg several feet
of water in her hold. The steam limpet
were tried, but failed to work, and there
were no hand pumps on board. How
ever, forty-six buckets were found, others
were improvised and the soldiers not em
ployed in working the ship were organ
ized Into five shifts and stripped, and
forming Hr.es they began bailing. The
officers worked with the men. passing the
buckets which were sent up to the deck
by a windlass. The longest t!mÂ»- a shirt
could stand was two hours, and often the
period was not longer than half an hour.
The bailing continued until the ship an
chored here.
The same day the leak was 3lscovered.
the machinery collapsed and the electric
lighting plant and distilling, evaporating
and refrigerating plants failed to work.
There were no lamps, and the few can
dles found were exhausted after a few
days. During the last week of the passage
the Manauense was in utter darkness at
night. She had beexi rolling in heavy seas
al! the way. but November 22 she encoun
tered a typhoon and pitched and tosÂ«Â»eÂ«i
alarmingly. The Peking became separated
from her duiir.cr the storm.
The water mÂ«e rapidly and the balling

In the meantime the men below, igncr- i
ant of their extreme peril, were passing i
buckets and singing '"What the Hell Do
We Care?" while the ship rolled help- \
lessly on the ocean with hatches closed
The heat was Intense until the typhoon
passed, and then the Peking, which had :
retraced her course about seventy miles. I
came alongside the Mar.auensÂ«?. which was
roiling so heavily that the soldiers in the
bold could at each rol! see the Peking :
through the hatches overhead. Colonel j
James S. Pettlt. commander of the Thir- ,
ty-ftm Volunteer Regiment, ordered the i
Manauense to proceed to Guam and awiu
relief, but the captain of the Manauense ,
demurred, the officers say. because tne i
Government was renting the ship for KM I
a day.
Thronghout the voyage the engines of
tbe Manauense fatled frequently, and the j
ship would roll for a few hours while the ;
engines were being repaired. then the ;
steamer would proofed again for a few i
hours. The meat and vegetables rotted
bt-eau-uÂ» of the failure of the refrigerators,
and were thrown overboard.
After the storm the water plied to ;
the ship at Honolulu had to be used {or
the boilers, ar.d there was little or none
for drinking. In fact, it Is asserted that
during the last week of the voyage the
m*r. lived almost entirely on whisky o-^r
and hardtack. The officers and soldiers
were entirely exhausted whÂ»n they
reached Manila. They declare that the
engineers were grossly incompetent. ThÂ«
officers also say that the behavior of tea
troops was beyond praise. For days â¢ v -.*y
worked In thÂ» dark, suffocating hold, w^fh
the water som<u!m*s up to th*lr shoulders
and planks washing about In a manner
dangerous to life and limb. The officers
took the lead in baling .nd encouraged
the men.
ThÂ» captain of thÂ» 3hlp promised the
men T> cents a d^y for baling, hut he now
proposes to pay them Jl 5A- The soldiers
talk of attaching the ship.
The regiment proceeded to Zanboar.ja
on the Peking to garrison several ports
on the island of Mindanao.
When the Mar.auense left San Francisco
on October 2tS she waÂ« considered in every
r*Â«p**ct a seaworthy vessel. She had
be<?n Inspected by -rain John M^tcalfe.
surveyor for L.!yo<ls, both when Â«he was
repairing and when on the drydock. and
he passed her as Seaworthy in every re
gpect. Then Captain Barneson. the marine
superintendent of rhe transport service,
and Captain Matthews, the superintend
ing engineer, examined her for the trans
port -ervlce, and lastly Captains Bolles
and Bulger, the inspectors of hulls ar.d
boilers, examined hÂ«r for the Govern
ment. All these gentlemen were satisfied
that the Manauense was seaworthy, and
so parsed upon her.
"The fact that the ship lived out a
typhoon that lasted three days is proof
positive that she was seaworthy." said
Captain Metcalfe. "That fact alone would
carry conviction to a seafaring man.
â¢â¢The Manauense had a crew of forty
nine all told, and was provisioned for a
six months' cmise. In fact, the supplies
put aboard the vessel cost over J4OOO. She
left Honolulu on November 5. and th->
City of Peking sailed fourteen hours later.
The Instructions to the captain of the
Manauense were to go along slowly and
wait for the Peking. Both vessels reached
Manila yesterday, and to have done so
must have averaged ten knots an hour

therefore be some exaggeration In the

HORSES POUNDED
TO DEATH AT SEA
SEATTLE, Nov. â  -With â  cargo of
dytng horses and mules and fifty-five
empty stalls, the United States transport
Victoria returned to port late last night. '
having been forced by an unprecedented j
stress of weather off (rape Flattery to turn :
back from her voyag*- to the Philippine*. :
Of the 41' i horses and mules carried by
the .Victoria, taken on board November
S3, fifty-five were literally pounded to
d^ath against the sides of their "tails in
the storm and the remaining animals are
so badly bruised that the officers of the
vÂ»Â«-Â«sel believe that many cannot bÂ» Â»aved.
The Victoria sailed for the Philippines
November 23. As the straits were neared
a high and dangerous Â«ea wa.< encoun
tered and the ship pitched and rolled
hÂ«-avily. shipping seas fore and aft. The
stress of weather increased as the Vic
toria advanced toward the open ocean.
On the morning of November 24 the ves
sel was rounded Just outside the straits
with her head to the wind. At 4 o'clock
on the afternoon of that day she was
tossing on the crest of the waves de
scribed In thÂ» log B.S mountain high, and
the strong gale blew thick with blinding
mist. The transport labored heavily dur
ing thÂ« night and early next morning
steamed away t the west, but began to
roll so dangerously that her head was
again brought around to the wind. This
day waa a repetition of th* preceding,
with the addition of terrific squalls. The
rolling and pitching of the ship now be
gan to have Its effect upon the animals
confined in their stalls. They had been
pounded from side to side until they were
in a state of utter exhaustion. Several
died during the night and the next mom-
Ing, and the constant attention of Verer-
Inary Surgeon Payne and the stockhands
seemed powerless to save them.
I'nder such circumstances it was de
termined after consultation between Cap
tain Michaels and his officers to round
the ship and head for Seattle. During
the trip in several more horÂ»es died,
bringing the number of deaths up to flfty
tlve. The bodies of the animals were
weighted ami thrown overboard as fast
as death came.
Purser Lockwood was seen thl3 morning
and said that during thirty-six voyages
he has made across the Pacific. he,nas
never seen such stress of weather a.* was
encounter<Â»d by the Victoria.' The furthest
point reachÂ«rd was 2ivÂ» miles west of the
i Cape. While the storm was at Its height
j oil bags were entirely emptied and every
| thing done to ease the motion of the ship.
Aside from the loss of animals no other
damage was done, the Victoria behaving
spier. I
Hardly a horse escaped Injury. Those
wholly sound will not number a score.
Many ha.d their necks broken, others
were battered, bruised and Shod to
death, while twenty-five or thirty, per
haps, sustained limb fractures, rendering
It neces*ar> to shoot them.
Captain W. W. Robinson Jr. of the
quartermaster's department M I it will
probably be a month before any of the
horses can again undertake a sea voyage.
Meanwhile a veterinary surgeon corps of

BERKELEY, Nov. 2S.â Less than two
days nnil the two collegiate foot
ball teams, trained for the gridiron
struggle in which their hopes and
Joys are at ike, will meet face â¢â â  fact*
for the groat battle of the year. All th"
I fronting and nagping of coaches Is over.
Three months of solid labor have been
passed at Palo Alto and Berkeley by play
| era and coaches, and until the signal
blows which sends the opposing forces
into collision Thursday afternoon a nerv
ous expectancy will lay hold of all. Noth
ing but signal practice will be attempted
by cltln-r team lu-morrow.
On the Berkeley Held this moon i
regular practice Kami-, and It was a hot
om\ concluded the season's preparation.
Tlie varsity lined up minus two of Its
resulm pla\ers, Cornish, center, and Cap
tain Whipi-ie. tackle. Cornish was the
victim of a nervoua headache, superin
duced by a severe attack of nausea. The
bill center, whose stalwart physique has
trlthstood the attacks of a seasons hard
knocks und cudgels, was anything but a
happy man to-day with his tempest
tossÂ«d stomach. By the writers of the
cojm hes and trainers he v:as laid off. al
thougu he wanted to play. He will be
doctored to remove the nudden visitation
of stomachic sickness.
Captain \V hippie did not play, for reas
ons other than physical ailments. While
his" te^m was in the throes of an arm
to-ann tussle on the field he was \n the
thri>fs of a geometry examination under
the supervision of Colonel Edwards, pro
fessor of mathematics, who 13 jealous cf
the inroads football has made" upon his
courses as far as popular interest Is con
cerned. On that examination depends the
faculty's consent for \v hippie to take part
I in the big came. Hut so strong is the
student opposition to Colonel Kdwnrds
I and his ultimatum that \Vhlpple will
probably play, faculty willing or not.
In the place of Cornish and the mathe
matically annoyed captain. Dunbar and
Clay tilled the vacant places on the line.
The twenty minutes 01 play showed the
team strong, quick and aggressive. As in
other practice games, no trick work was
attempted. Hopper, who is now in Ellis"
j'lace at quarter. played faster and surer
ball than at unx time this season. The
backs, Hull. Smith and Kaarsberg.
worked well together, and some long end
runs were the features of the day.
Womble was the star, and his playing
is far and away the best of any of Cali
fornia's men. The strong, point of Cali
fornia's last practice was the i:,terfereneo.
which forms rapidly and holds fast under
nttack.
This *Â»venlnp another rally was held on
the campus. Conforming to the precedent
established last year, the tackllng-hag
was burned on the campus. Around a
bonfire, the collegians congregated and
gave way to a wild orglo of shouts and
college songs. Soon after the hour for as
semblage a stand was brotight into the
Hirht and -college speakers harangued the
throng on the approaching struggle. 1*

tobacco were distributed and the rally
did not break up until after a great
smoker. Then, ax a finale, a procession
was formÂ«*d and the streets of the town
paraded until th* bbarse and exhausted
colleplans could yell no longer.

Lively Boxing Bouts in San
Francisco Athletic Club
Gymnasium.
Three drawn battles and one which
ended abruptly In the second round was
' the result last night of the four bouts ar
ranged by the officials of the San Fran
cisco Athletic Club. Charles Fredericks
proved the hard hitter of the evening.
His opponent, Ed Nolan, was on the de
fensive from the start, but managed to
: land some blows which stopped his gal
i lop In a degree. He knocKed Fredericks
I down in the first round, bill the latter
! was up quickly. In the second round
! Fredericks sailed In and soon had Nolan
In difficulty. A left swing on the Jaw
finally landed on the effective point and :
Nolan dropped to his haunches with a \
thud and rolled over on the Uoor. He
remained down the full ten seconds and
was counted out. 11. was still a little
unsteady on his legs when he left the
ring.
The principal bout was between George
Baker and "Wily" Martin of Los An
geles. Neither man proved a skillful box
er, but both stood up and took a lot of
punishment. In the fourth round Martin
sustained a badly cut eye and mouth,
both of which bled profusely thereafter,
giving the bout a most sanguinary ap
pearance. Bak*>r kept up a rapid :re at
the Injured spots. to the evident discom
fiture of Martin. In the eighth round Mar
tin went after Baker and forced him
I around the ring.
I lloth tired under the high pressure, but
continued trying for a blow that would
end matters. In the ninth and tenth
rounds Martin found difficulty In keeping
on his foet, but was game to the end.
After going ten rounds the Judges called
for an extra round. Martin showed to ad
vantage for a Uine, but Haker came back
at him. and the men fought to a stand
still. Roferee Oreggnlns called It a draw.

JONES HAS
PLUCK TO
GIVE AWAY
Thrown From Dr. Bernays,
He Went Out and
Won Handily.
Jockey Eddie Jones was the hero of the
racing at Oakland yesterday. While at
the post In the second event, a mile and
a sixteenth run. he was snapped off the
back of the second choice. Dr. Bernays,
by being too quick for the barrier, and as
he law prone on the track it was feared
he had suffered severe injury. After shak
inK off his rider Dr. Bernays ran away a
mile and â¢Â». furlong, and was then led hack
to the post. Jones pluckily remounted the
chestnut horse, and going to the front won
all the way, beating Gotobed two lengths.
When the winning rider returned to the
stand he was accorded a most hearty re
ception. Ostler Joe. the favorite, ran as
if he had seen his best dayÃ.
The betting was quite as lively at usual
at the track over the bay. Three choices
succeeded in winning purses.
With a big field of sixteen lining up at
the barrier. Flamaway, the 5 to 2 favorite,
downed his company for the opening
scramble. Spencer landed Barney Bcbrelb
â¦t"h Zurich in the place two lengths bÂ«.
fore Tirade.
With â  slight call in the betting over
I mint, Montanus, the entry of Billy
Randall, succeeded In capturing the third
number. The gÂ» ldlng was heavily played,
and In .1 hard drive downed Faversham,
which had made all the running, â  note.
Lothian was a clove third. l'Hnainiru fin
ished last.
By it p.. or exhibition of riding Bpcncer
succeeded In getting Dunblane, favorite
for the fourth number, beaten. Pocketed
at the stretch turn, the "Ice man" cot
font-loose In time to get third place. Vitti
toe, on Decoy, went the "overland" into
the stretch, getting the decision from
Floridan by a head at the wire.
Opponent received extensive backing to
win the mile and a quarter run; but Forte,
handled by Phelan. captured the plum.
Schrelber's borse early took a fancy to
the route, and had â  pound or more to
spare at the finish. The favorite led Don
Luis out but two lengths for the place.
For a wonder, Pat Morrlssey did not
rule an od<ls-on choice for the final sprint,
over the Futurity course, closing an I to I
favorite. Thorpe waited with the "Celt"
horse to the bend for home, where he cut
loose, winning by a length from King
Carnival ut the finish. San Matco ran
third.
Track Notes.
Jockey Tullett has been reinstated by
the Stockton Driving Club.
Frank Van Ness lost Fair Test on Mon
day evening from lung fever.
Walter Jennings was wrathy over the
fiagfall in the last event. He thought that
as Ferguson had swished the recall flag
when San Mateo was left he might have
done the same thing when Ventoro, the
second choice, was left standing. Perhaps
Mr. Ferguson can give a more definite de
scription of the use and abuse of the flag
than the writer.

characterized th*. action of the dÂ»ad tn bo

Mary Morrissey. a Discharged TÂ«ach-
er. Practically Wins HÂ»r Suit.
In an opinion overruling a demurrer in
terposed on behalf of the defendant in
the action of Miss Mary Morri*Â«ey
against the Board of Education Jn.lge '
Murasky has practically givtr- Judprnent
for the plaintiff and has added another
decision 10 the many limiting the pow- !
ers of the defendant board. Miss Mor
rissey was principal of thÂ« John Swett
Evenir.fr School, which was closed by the
board at a recent date. whÂ«rn various
classes throughout the city were consjii- 1
dated. Several teachers were assigned to
other classes, but others were not, amoni;
them being Miss Morrissey. She applied
for a writ Â«"f mandate to compel her rein
statement. The board demurred to her pe
tition on thÂ» ground that she was dis
missed through a consolidation of c!aÂ«ses

MONEY IN THE TREASURY
Various Funds Enriched by the Large
Tax Collections.
From figures In the City Treasurer's of
nee It was ascertained yesterday that
there has been collected by Tax Collector
Sheehan the sum of J3.745.77<5 IS for taxes
on personal property and real estate in
this city and -county. Besides this amount
there Is now In the Tax Collector's vault
waiting to be transmitted to the treas
ury nearly $lOO.r<Â«) more, which will bring
the total collections up to nearly $3 $â¢>} -
(â¢JO. The entire amount of taxes to be
collected for city and State purposes
foots up to nearly SSjQOOjOOO. of which the
cltv's thare â will be something over $4 000 -
000. The second Installment of taxes on
real estate remain yet to be paid In a
cumber of Instances, and It Is expected
that there will be the usual 5 per cent
Of the taxes remaining unpaid when they
become delinquent next June.
Of the sum already collected thÂ« treas
ury ofilclals have apportioned to the va
rious funds In segregated amounts the
sum of $;,â¬5Â»).â¬94 S"5 for the fiscal year end
ing June 30. ISOO. The signs that have
graced th" Treasurers office, -mine
the public that such and such a fund was
exhausted, have been taken down and
it Is thought that the city may. by Judi
cious methods, creen out of its financial
tangle now that there is plenty of money
on hand.

TWO SUICIDES.
Strong Drink and Loss of Employ
ment Drove Men to Death.
George A. Fredericks, a manufacturer
residing at <>ISA Central avenue, and John
Murphy, an Iron molder recently em
ployed at Vailejo. and residing at 41 Te
harr.i street, committed suicide yester
day afternoon. Fredericks Inhaled pa*
from a Ion? lead pipe which he fastened
to a burner, and Murphy slashed hts
throat with a razor.
Fredericks formerly conducted a saloon
in Ban Francisco and at present is en.
gaged in the manufacture of beer taps.
He began drinking some time ago and
recently Indulged heavily. Yesterday
afternoon hi* wife returned home from
town and was startled to find his body
stretched cut on the bed and the room
full of pas. Dr. H. Meyer was called, but
when he arrived life was extinct. Depu
ties Lccomb and Flanagan investigated
thÂ«Â» case for the Coroner. Deceased was
about 35 years of age and owns consider
able property In this city. He has a
wealthy father residing In the East.
Murphy committed suicide by cutting a
horrible gash in his throat with a razor
at the corner of Howard and Fremont
street-. His act !s lupposed to have been
the result of his failure to secure em
ployment. It is said that the man par
ticipated In the recent Iron molderV strike
and was blacklisted. Since then he has
been able to work but a short length of
time in any particular place, and this
condition of affairs preyed upon his
mind.
Murphy was discharged from Vailejo
about six weeks agro. He came to San
Francisco and resided with his daughter

of that kind is worth study, for it is significant of the

She brought on the war by the claim of suzerainty
in the internal attairs of the Transvaal and began her

in line with her policy of demanding "> the
Trails. ial Republic certain changes in its purely in
tenial and domestic laws In its abandonment she
abandons the whole cause and provocation. She id
nits that she had no right to interfere in the domestfc
of that government It will be observed that
her Ktnal suzerainty over the international affair* of
the Transvaal was limply the assertion in South
Sail 'in English Monroe- doctrine, by
which sht I that no European Governments

South Africa in the lame sense in which the United

materially righted the position she must occupy in
history England now becomes subject to the action
of the powers just as Russia did when her arms had
overborne the Turks in the Balkan campaign. She
had Turkey at her mercy; she could liter Stan.'
she could expel Turkey from Europe. But England
and Germany and France interfered and made the
fruit of her conquest an affair to be dealt with by a
concert of the powers, and the result was the treaty
of Berlin by which Rossi was forbidden to take what
she had won in battle, and her dream of a port on
the Bosphorus had to be abandoned. In that treaty
England was the leader, and she established a prece
dent which she cannot now disown with honor. She
stood, in the beginning of this war, independent of
European diplomacy and seemingly relied entirely
upon what she was pleased to treat as a sentimental
alliance with the people of the United States. The
cause of her sudden change is a mystery. It may
have been some recent plain evidences, that the people
of this country refuse to be treated as her allies.
And so it may mean that she feels safer in the hand
of a European concert than in such an American al
liance. If this be so that concert, once established,
may make concessions to her that would project its
consideration into American pretensions in the Orient
that will bode no good to the imperial ambitions of
the United States.

THE TIME TO ACT.
AS the principal speaker at the recent Chamber
of Commerce banquet in New York Tom
Reed made what might be called his debut as
a citizen of that metropolis. His speech was the chief
event of the evening, though there was an incident
that merits mention as an illustration of certain ten
dencies in New York to cultivate too far the desire
of an imperial alliance with Great Britain. The toast,
"The President," was followed immediately by one
to "Her Majesty, Victoria." A little later in the
evening the toastmastcr, Mr. Jessup, when giving
the toast, Our Relations With Great Britain," said,
by a slip of the tongue, "Gentlemen, you have already
drunk the health of her Majesty. Queen of the United
States."
Such a slip, however, did not mar the occasion.
For the time imperialism was a minor issue Tlt
rtant subject which engaged the attention of
! the gucÂ«ts after the dinner was over wrai the gold
standard, and it was to thai Mr. Reed addressed hira-
He began by informing the New Yorkers that
in a country so larpe as the United States it iÂ« not
possible for them to have their own way in all things,
and proceeded to exen-e Congress for not having set-
Ued the question ere this. Moreover, he pointed out
that the two bousei of Congress have hitherto been
divided on the issue, so that neither House was re
ipontiMf for the faihire to legislate. To that extent
liiÂ« speech WSJ an apology for the past, but he be
came more firm and definite in speaking of the issue
( as presented now.
Hit argument was that by full discussion the coun
' try has at last become convinced <.f the folly of the
â¢ movement and bai elected a Congress pledged
to ettabKah the gold *tandnrd. hut there is no telling
when tome other issue may arise which will divert
attention from the money question, and then there
will be danger onksi |he standard has been taken out
of the power of an administration to determine. "Let
â¢ i the gold standard by law." he said, "and then
. if the people with to repeal it they may. but it shoul 1
never be left in the hands of the administration to ?o
Administer the law we have that its amply and fully
; declared intent should be frittered away."
Speaking oi the danger that this question may be
doaded by others in the near future, Mr. Reed
pointed to the warning given in Ohio. "Two years
KgO f N he said, "when we were in earnest and the ques
tion of monetary standard was fully before the people,
the candidate who represented the gold Mandard re
ceived 5-Jw.ooo votes and all bis opponents receive 1
450.000. That was 40.000 majority. This year the
Republican candidate had but 40.000 plurality, while
a third candidate had 106.000 votes. In the old days,
when a majority over all was required, there would
have been no election. I do not enter into the ques
tion of whether such an opposition can be united: I
think it could not: nevertheless, that is a chance which
had better not be taken. Rut it is not the figures
themselves that are of much account. It is what they
indicate. If there is a settled national feeling men
vote for men and things, but when the public mind
is unsettled they vote against men and things. Both
Ohio and Kentucky arc examples of this."
The lesson to be learned from that warning is too
plain to be mistaken. The time to settle the question
of the standard is now. There is no telling when the
people of the country at large may grow discontented
and vote against things, thus putting into power the
party of negation, which is the party of free stiver.

THE DEAD LETTER OFFICE.
rROM the annual report of the superintendent
of the Dead Letter Office concerning the busi
ness of the fiscal year ending with last June it
appears there has been a singular increase in the num
ber of letters which, for one reason or another, have
had to be turned by the postoffice officials over to
the dead Utter department
Letters and parcels held for postage, including both
foreign and domestic addresses, were last year 145,
577, as against **5.y0~ in the previous year, an in
crease of 59,670, or (<t per cent. Misdirected letters
and parcels were 367.4Â°-). aeainst 352,870, being an
increase of 14,559- The number of pieces of mail
matter dropped into the boxes without any ajddresa
kt all were 71.01 Q. an increase of 5120 over the preced
\v\i year, and in domestic hotel letters returned to the
dead letter office there was an increase from 198,411
in the fiscal year lSr>B to 294.739 last year, or an in
crease of nearly 50 per cent.
It is probable that a lar^c proportion of these in
creases wa> due to the war, letters sent to soldiers
being misdirected or mailed without postage. It is,
however, not easy to explain the 50 per cent increase
in the hotel letters, unless it be that the increase in
prosperity gave more people an opportunity to travel
and visit hotels than in the former year and conse
quently increased the amount of mail sent to hotel ad
i'.re~ â¢
There are other increases which will require an ex
pert to explain. Thus the number of unclaimed par
cels, including unmailable ones addressed to foreign
countries, those returned from abroad and such as
contained photographs, was 107,675, as against 109,
529, or an increase of about 55 per cent, while the
ordinary unclaimed domestic parcels numbered 71,
oji, . 1 39,153, an increase of more than 80

c of the striking features of the report is tint
relating to letter* and parcels containing money
which by the careles^ne^ of senders find their way to
tin dead letter office. AniotiÃ the letters opened ai
the oliice there were 43J08 with inclosures amount
ing to ?^r 575s 75 a 6. ('f thnt kind of letters, however,
there was a decrease, for in the previous year money
iund in 70.755 letter- opened at the ot'tice. The
><c in tin* instance is due to the fact that during
the year the Government had broken up a Rood many
fraudulent enterpri-es and withheld the mail ad
ied t-> them.
Letter^ containing drafts and notes were 33.976,

year has been that in the number of merchandise r;

response. There were recently on hand at one time
more than 21.000 of these parcels, which were finally
returned to this company at a >ingle shipment, full

more than $41 <o.

SECOND DISTRICT REPUBLICANS.
WITH a promptness which is in every way com
mendable the Republican organization of the
Second Congressional District has begun the
work of preparing for the coming campaign. The
organization has recently adopted a set of by-laws
declaring it-* purposes, "to promote, encourage and
sustain absolute and unqualified loyalty to the Gov
ernment of the United States; to further and by social,
moral and political influence assist in inculcating the
principles of the Republican party; to use every just
and honorable means toward the renomination of Wil
liam McKinley as the Republican standard-bearer of
iqoo and to secure his re-election to the Presidency
of the United States."
It is none too early for Republicans in all parts of
the State to begin making ready for the contest that
is now so rapidly approaching. In years when
Presidential elections are to take place the various
county and State conventions have to be held earlier
than usual in order to elect delegates to the national
conventions. That entails a beginning of the prelim
inary work of organization several months sooner
than in ordinary years. The movement started in
the Second District might, therefore, be well fol
lowed elsewhere.
The batch of National Guard "generals" who are
squabbling over uniforms for the citizen soldiers
should hasten to clothe themselves before the scrutin
izing eyes of the public see too much of their naked
ness.
One of the most ambitious efforts recently made in
the United States to raise the wind is recorded in
New York. The fan-makers have organized a
twenty-five million dollar trust.
Military experts are not only unanimous in the
opinion that the Roers and Rritish are worthy of each
other's steel, but also that both are trying to deliver
the goods.

One of the Immediate effects of the new

Supervisors will bo called upon to pay
out of the public treasury between $23,000
and 150,000 In rebates to the wholesale and
retail merchants of the city. Under the
present law these merchants are taxed
from $3 to $1000 a year for the privilege
of doing business, the sum being regu
lated by the amount of business trans
acted.
The new charter especially exempts all

wipes out the tax. goes Into effect. Thoso
whose licenses expired on the Ist of De

Mr Lee* says h<Â» Is acting under the

The law says the licenses must be paid
quarterly, and he has no authority to
accept payment for one month or for any
fraction of the stated period Over $55,000
was collected from the merchants on Oc

the First was on the Sherman homeward
bound resolutions were adopted and frjin
these it would appear that all were a.ix
ious to get back into the service of the
State of California nd be Jolly soldiers
again as Â»n day? before the war. ]>â¢:'
since â :. men have been out of the ser
vice of Uncie Sam and are no In igÂ»r sol
diers, but free American citizens, a
change ha.a come over nearly 45 per cent
of the eligible* and these have come to
the conclusion that riftecn months on 'he
transports, at Manila and the island of
Luzon generally liiis given them all .he
soldiering they want should they live the
allotted *â¢ pan "of three score and ten.
Yet. while this 15 per cent have signed
the must roll to enable the companies
of the First Regiment. N. G. C. to *et
back into the guard. It â â -â¢â¢- much
for the love of the guard as for a purpose.
And that purpose is to have the privilege
of "getting even." These men say that
they have a grievance against the of
ficers who were their superiors in the
field on the island of Luzon and th- rrur
murs of discontent are low but gÂ»nÂ«ral.
The commissions of ten of the twelve cap
tains who tr.tered the service at the \Â«e
ginr.ir.g of the war have expired and there
are many of the first and second lieuten
ants whose commissions have also rjn
out. So. when the twelve companies of
the regiment shall have rÂ»*eived official
recognition It will become necessary to
crder elections through the proper mili
tary channels. It if then ... mil
contents expect to get in their work in
the most approved style and each has
his little Filipino machete whetted to a
tine ed?e with which to cut deep into
the ambitions of those officers who are
anxious to continue wearing shoulder
straps. The indications at this time are
that possibly eight of the twelve captains
who are reporting back for duty wi'.l be
relegated to civil life to become members
of the extensive order of Very Great
Have Beens. As to the number of lieu
tenants who wi'.l join th-*m these men only
know and they won't tell. The talk in
this direction has taken on such propor
tions during the past fÂ»'w days that some
of the captains, it is said, will decline to
have th'"ir names placed in nomination.
Be that as it may. one thing Is certvn â
there will be hiph old times in the ar
mory of the First Regiment at Page and
Gough streets and at the Ellis street ar
mory wh*n thÂ» elections take place.
The point that has been ralseo. in recard
to the uniform board having â¢â â â¢â¢
power in the matter of letting contracts
in the manner it did, that is. without
requisitions for the uniforms from com
pany commanders, is said ;o have been
well takon and that it places the board in
anything but a pleasant lijrht as to knowl
edge of the law that governs It.
Another matter that has been mooted
is that c-f the goods being of quality that
will wear. It Is a fact that the go ids
are to be furnished at prices lower than
what the War Department of the United
States pays for the same class of goods.
There are seme who wonder how the con
tractors will be able to supply equally
pood material for a less price than L'ncle
Sam pays and they are anxiously await
ing the delivery of the different -
so that they m.iy have an opportunity of
discovering If they are up to the stand
ard. The rremb^rs of the uniform board
have declared that in a number of par.ic
ulars the State uniforms will be supe
rior to those furnished by Uncle Sam to
men of the regular army. A prev.r>'is
uniform hK.ard made a similar declaration
a number of years ago and when the
goods were delivered they turnod out to
be the miÂ« unserviceable that were ever
furnished ?<, the soldiers of the State.
If the members of the uniform board
had followed the law und>:-r which they
derive their authority they would have
bÂ«en able to help the workers In the
St.ite, for they would hayÂ» procured the
rloth and material and had the uniforms
made In this State. By this they would
have encouraged home industry, about
which Lieutenant Colonel Gli sting has
had a gr^at deal to say. but a* they let the
contracts the wace-t-arners of this city
ami State have been deprived of a gr i at
deal of that which it is claimed rightfully
bÂ«-lon?s to them. As it is the bulk of tne
uniforms are being made in Cincinnati,
a part will be made in New York City and
another part in Philadelphia.
FATHER McKINNON LECTURES.
The Army Chaplain Talks of Canada
to St. Joseph's Congregation.
A lecture by Army Chaplain McKlnnon
was the It- niing feature of the entertain
ment given at St. Josephs Hall, Howard
and Tenth streets. luu*i night. The pro
ceeds of the affair are to be devoted to
the payment of the church's taxes, and a
giKxiiy sum will be rr>tliied.
The reverend gentleman called his lec
ture "Frum Manila to Washington."
though, as he remarked. "Scenes in Can
ada" would have been a more fitting title,
the views shown being ch'efiy taken In
that country. The nrst part of the lec
ture was devoted to Manila scenes, the
speaker remarking in the course of his
address on the c&lumny which Americans,
â who know nothing of the matter, have
heaped on the Spanish friars.
"These men." said he. "are most charit
able and broadminded. Nowhere will you
rind a more devoted body of men than
these friar-" of the Phtllpi'lnes."
Several entertaining specialties were
Introduced. Kelleher and O'Connor danc
ing themselves Into high favor. Af;*r the
olio the speaker told his audience of the
natural wonders of Canada, showing
many Interesting views <Â»f the lions of
the principal cities. The winter scenes
especially delighted the audience.
The gentleman in charge of thÂ« affair
and who brought it to Its successful con
clusion were as follows: Rev. Father
Keane. John Mclnervey. R J. Cummings.
Thomas Nolan. T. Nulev. T. Cad*gan. M.

HORSEFLESH IN SAUSAGES.
Georg-e Dutchler, Who Admitted His
Guilt. Heavily Fined by Judge
Conlan.
George Dutchler. the >;Â«vj = ;ii,-Â» man at
Eighteenth and Shotwell streets, who
pleaded guilty to using horseflesh in his
Eausages, appeared for sentence before
Judge Conlan yesterday morning.
Prosecuting Attorney Low said that
Dutchler had been heavily punished al
ready as he had lost his business through
the exposure In the newspapers. H#
thought that people were at fault in not
knowing what they wore buying.
The Judge said there was no excuse for
the defendant. He had usÂ»-d horseflesh
and had sold the articles .xs "beef
sausages." which was a deception of the
worst kind. He administered a severe
verbal castication to the defendant and
said he would give him the full limit. $2M
fine with the alternative of 230 days In the
County JaiL Dutchler was taken to the
City Prison, but waÂ« shortly afterward re
leased, a friend having called and paid the
fine to Sergeant Llndheimer.
The rase of Charles Haag. .Â«au.Â«age
manufacturer. Valencia street, charged
with a similar offense, was called. He
pleaded not guilty, waived a Jury and the
case was set for â¢-â  â¢ Monday.

ONE CHAPLAIN
WHO LOOKED OH
RED, RED WINE
David Shields to Be
Court-Martialed.
Captain Bartlett Charges Him With I
Being Drunk in Uniform and
in the Presence of
Soldiers.
Â»
The Rev. David H. Shields, chaplain in
th* regular army, will have to lay aside
for a while the cup that cheers so he can
attend to the duties of a court-martial,
he playing the part of accused. His bibu
lous antics on Alcatraz Island have com?
to the ears of the department com
mander, and by his direction the com
manding officer of the island. Captain
Bartlett of the Third Artillery, ha.- pre
ferred charges against the reverend gen
tleman. The allegations are that he hai
been absent without leave, drunk in un i.
form and drunk in the presence of pri
vate soldiers, all in violation of half a
dozen articles of war and as many mora
regulations of the army.
The misdeeds of the chaplain have been
going on for some time*. He was assigned
to Aleatraz Island over a month ago and
since then he has earned a reputation
j that would give him ail kinds of fame
on the cocktail route. His brother min
is terÂ«-that is. the minister* of his faith
i in civil lifeâ finally took up the matter
and called the attention of the command
ing general of the department to the ca>e,
: butt- . found that the general was al
ready r-wise"! on th- subject. The order
for the court-martial followed hard upon
their visit.
The detail for the court is as follows:

111. READING COURSES AND A
GIRL'S LIBRARY.
BY JOHN MILLAR. M. A-
The Reading of Poetry.
Whatever may be the tastes or talents
of young women for literature, they can
not overlook poetry. Sooner or later they j
should hope to know of Shakespeare. Mil- ;
ton and Goethe. The great poets rank !
next to the Bible. To be Ignorant of
Cowper and Burns. Whittier and Long- j
fellow. Scott and Tennyson, is to have 1
the mind dwarfed. Browning and Words- I
worth will tax the powers of mature |
years, but poetry should not It rejected
because of its depth or obscurity. Poetry
should be especially read to give a proper ,
attitude of mind, a habit of thinking of
noble things, of keeping the spirit In har
mony with beauty, goodness, strength and
love. A poÂ«m like Tennyson's "In Me
moriam" Is worth more than a dozen
popular novels. Of all kinds of literature
poetry Is the most stimulating and refin
ing. The poet Is the best representative
of the spirit cf his age. To read what he '
creates is to recreate In one's own mind
the Images and pictures which he first
conceived and then expressed in verse. '
If a girl has no dÂ»slre to ad poetry
there is some defect in her training. Chil
dren love poetry. To ignore poetry 1Â» to j
slight tho:Â»e productions which Shelley !
calls "the best and happiest thoughts of
the best and happiest minds." The main
purpose of poetry Is to give pleasure, and
pleasure of a kind, if the choice 18 well
made, that will elevate and ennoble.
MÂ«rs ar.d more." says Matthew Arnold,
"mankind will discover that we have to
turn to poetry to Interpret life for us. to
console us. to sustain us."
Variety in Reading.
If general reading is desirable for men.
it is also desirable. If only In a less de
gree, for women. Fiction and poetry
hare been considered more at length be
cause they necessarily and properly will
receive much attention from most girls.
It is a pity that young women so often
lark general Information. It does not ren
der a woman less attractive If she has an
Intelligent comprehension of the many
public matter 3 discussed In the newspa
pers. She does not necessary become an
advocate of female suffrage by under
standing political questions. The social
and economic problems of our times af
.'ect the welfare of both men and women.
A girl should Include biography and his
tory In her reading cours* s. The former
Is especially valuable for young persons.
To know the lives of distinguished people
la to know, to a great extent, all the
knowledge and resources of their times.
Th-> study of biography furnishes us with
valuable Ideals for life's duties and It
cures us of affectation. It supplies us
with the accumulated wiÂ«dom of the past
and lncr*aÂ«Â«-s our regard for the divine
attributes which have been implanted In
the human heart. A girl Is filled with a
new inspiration when she reads the life
of a good woman. Biography Is more val
uable than fiction because It holds up pos
sible Ideals History also. If properly stu
died, gives a broader view to woman's
lnfluer.ee as a social factor. It should not
be regarded as an account of battles and
sieges, nor should It suggest the memor
izing of dates or the enumeration of what
is given in genealogical trees. Young per
sona may readily understand and appre
ciate history if regard Is had to historic
landmark*, or if they .... see
how smaller events are connected with
larg?r ones. If the Imagination has been
properly trained there will be no danger
of fanciful impressions gaining an ad
vantage. The power of drawing correct
conclusions wtll br cultivated and the
power of realizing truth will be height
ened. It Is unreasonable to limit the
range of a woman's thoughts any more
than those of a man to the dally routine
of the average life. Th i efforts neces
sary to pfovlde a living will demand
much attention, but women no more than
men can live by bread alone.
Any advice for girls regarding reading
courses would be defective that did rot
give prominence to periodical literature.
The home should be provided with news
papers and magazines, and preference
should be given to thoÂ«e clean In tone and
bright in character. A goo-, dally news
paper may furr.'.sh the family with topics
of valuable conversation. Idle gos.'ip has
little chance where there are sensible sub

Find the simple Interest at 5 per cent on
a mortgage for $1S"O which ha* been run
ning fur 3 years and 4 months.
Tty a rate of 5 per cent we mean a ;
charge of 15 a year for every $100 bor
rowed; $1300 then will cost ISOOxS-i-100. or
$75 a year, and for 3 1-3 years the interest
charge will be 3 1-3 time* $73, or $250. Be
fore proceeding with more dliTlcuU ex

running 3 years.
>Cote_\VhenC ot e_\Vhen Interest Ls charged on over
due interest it Is called compound inter- |
est. For Instance, in the foregoing ex- j
ample If the interest due at the end of the ;
first year were added to the principal, and \
the Interest for the second year reckoned j
en the two together, the interest would
be called compound Interest to distinguish
it from ordinary or simple Interest.

To nnÂ«l the exact Interest for a period

education, but she has generally the op
portunity of becoming fairly well In

proficiency in mu.Â«lcâ a very desirable ac

Books in the Home.
Happy is that girl whos* early honi-9
surroundings permit her to form the rail
ing habit unconsciously. The parents urvl
friends who furnish children with boo*.*
and periodicals are doing no small sb.irn
toward forming an lntetlljent community.
'Give me a house." says Beecher. "fur
nished with books rather than furniture."
A. house should no more be without a li
brary than without a kitchen or bedroom.
Even If ihe house have bat one room. .>pÂ«
corner of it should be the place where a>
few books are to bÂ«Â« found. Better to pry.
vide good books than costly ornaments.
I One comfortable room well stocked w.Â»tÂ»
pcoks 1* more to b* preferred than amr.
lÂ°r with expensive decorations. John
Bright once remarked: "In the house-* of
the humble a little library. In my opinion.
* a most precious possession." A girl*
library should have a place for Its con
tents, even If It cccuples only a little shelf
I m one corner of her bedroom. It shew.-*
! a. curious defect In home training where \
home is found without book*. When therÂ«Â»
are no books there is th* absence of one of
the best agencies to make up for the pos
sible loss of school advantages. If th*
absence of a imall library Is due to pov
erty there Is some excuse. When there is
evidence of means the lack of books show
a lack of culture It too often bappors
that the â¢ daughters of well-to-do parent*)
show little appreciation of good reading
matter. Money Is expended on dress ami
socials, but books are seldom purchased.
It Is one of the most Incongruous sights
to see an elegant bouse with flne furni
ture, paintings of the masters. valuab'Â«
bric-a-brac, elaborate frescoes, expensive
house plants, and yet scarcely a standard
work In the library. Th* ridiculous 14
reached when a few books with costly
bindingsâ supposed to be editions de luxe
are purchased which have co 1.-.tr'..-.* o
merit. .
j Children should be trained to valu* their
â  rooks. The volumes which a girl <*i*
1 when at school should bÂ« retailed and
should become precious reminders of
! youthful days. The books one adds to her
; libra ry from year to year will probably
mark her Intellectual and moral growth.
; The volumes purchased should be for v*Â«
j and not for ornament. If ; .l-- â  - - arÂ«
marked when read they will be more ser
viceable for reference. A public llbra'y.
though valuable, can never meet the need*
lor a private one. For the ordinary read-r
1 a great many books are rot needÂ»d. !n a,
: library of fifty or a hundred volume* In
! finite riches may be found. Almost any
j girl who tries may hare In a few year* a,
I fair library. Only the best books shouli
j be selected, and If the leisure moment*
are Judiciously employed several works
miv be mastered in a year. Parent*
should give their children help tn forming
the nucleus of a library- It Is a pleasure
to see a young woman retaining tn* nory
books she received In childhood. There â¢Â»
some sensible advice In one of Emerson*
rules for readingâ "to read no book unttl
It is a year old. It would not be well tj
follow this rule in all rase*, ar.d yet tf ob
served It would prevent many ephemeral
novelties from raining such a great cir
culation. Some persons appear to regard,
It a mark of social distinction to hayÂ«
read the latest novel.
Books should not be locked up and krrt
in 90m* unfrequented room. It Is tetter
for a girl to have her books convenient
for every -day use than to have them nre
served like stun>d birds In a glass caÂ»Â«*.
Open shelves are better than glass-doorM
bookcases. For a private library Â»hÂ«
original binding locks better for books
than brown paper cover*. Plain, substan
tial bindings are better than costly â¢>!!
tions. The latter should be left for ,rtr!s
; who are better Judges rf the outside than
the Inside of a book. One's books thouli
' be treated as companions, and proper carÂ«
lof them Is a mark of gtod taste, it lock*
I bad to seÂ« books lying around like plÂ«t
j shoes. The advice long ago given by Rlrn
ard de Bury Is valuableâ "never to sp.
j roach a volume with uncleanly hands.

ns sales are now based on about 19 shilling*

this year have been topsy-turvy, as the de

the nutuml drift of coal and wheat carriers

Lhe wreck as a menace to navigation and
iitivr^atf* Its removal, said:
"The Navy Department has nothing to

a military matter and should b^ done by
the army engineers. If General Brooke
war.:* it removed I do not suppose there
would be any objection."
At the War Lvpartmen: It was said ro
advic-es had b*Â«?n received from General
Brooke rejanJing the Maine. He is in
favor of removing the debris and recover

tiead sailers by building a huge caisson
around the wr-<k. After th* recovery r -t
the t^jd;r< General Broike would either
destroy the Maine or rats* it and tow it

General Fltzhujrh L<Â»Â« claims that there
are in the Maine more bodies than were
barfed in th* cemetery at Havana. He fa
vors the takin* cut of these bodies and

for those who thought tnat social and

were to be made. But thiÂ»sÂ» revelations
will never come, s'.nce the two contestants
cot together ar.d adjust-;-! their dinW
â¢nceÂ», and r.ot only are all of the ex

promise, but the greatest Â«?rr*:y is main
tained over the details of the compromise

The cotepmmise was made one week ago

have beÂ«n in th*r control of the attornevj
for each side for ail that pcrt:d of tirr.*.

the most Iroa-clad oath tra? taken by all
parties that nothinsr be *aid uitil
the documents Â»<*rÂ»* died, and Â«.ven thÂ»n
no details of the compromise should bÂ«

At the same tirrv* it w.t* arrar.iM so
that Mr. Dir.^ee c uld make his -scap^
from Oakland before the ri:yrr.isÂ«a!s were
taadÂ« in order that he mic^t avctd toe
r.tcesjity cf an Interview. Mr. DtnjrÂ«e is
averse to beifls interviewed, and this was
one of the exactions fr>"m his fide. And
so It was t'r. v Mr. Dir.jr-e fj^partt-d at an
early hour :h:s morning for ihÂ» East, and
that â  f"w hours later Juiice Gre<?r.<? con
tinued th^? trial of Mrs. Sather's suit

until some hour? later that the dismissals
were filed.

An efTort is tÂ«ir.^ ma-ie by the atftrr.eys â¢

eff.cacy cf :h* deposition for cor.ductin< :

In a brief interview Senator Perkins
?ivea expression to the belief that C.Â»
coming sÂ«rs*lcn Â«f Congress wtll be ooÂ« of
historical Â»^nincar-cc. He believes that
a r.tis:3Â«-r of very tmpcrtant questions w-.u

At the outset I cv opposed to the acaut*
sitlcn of the Islands, bat I now nccrmz*
the fact that we have them asd must coa
trol and covera them."
As to the near jf3%-emment of Pcrto Rleo
the Senator believed that the bill to fcÂ«
passed would carry with it the d^trtcs
plan, similar to that over A <**. L As fy
the ultimate disposition of Cuba the
Â«p-Â»aker was net prone to tx^rei* him

The Laura Madsen and the schooner Ura

DEATH OF JAMES D. WALKER.
Weil-Known Business Man of This
City Expires in England.
News from a private source has been
received in this city of the death at Shal
den, Devonshire. England, on November
11. of James D. Walker, a gentleman well
known In commercial circles In San Fran
cisco.
James D. Walker was for many y#ars
an active resident of this city and was at
different times president and director of
many luast-pubUc corporations. .v-^
early an 1k64 he was manager of the Bank
of British Columbia and soon after Joined
the well-known Him of Falkner. Bell &.
Co.~Mr. Walker was for Home time a di
rector of the Spring Valley Water Com
pany and also served the San Francisco
oas Company In a like capacity. He be
came president of the Marln Water Com
pany and organized and was president of
the California Redwood Company, which
purchased about 70,000 acres of redwood
land and four lumber mills in Humboldt
County and shipped the lirst ears: â¢ of
redwood to Europe. He also served as
president of the North racitlc Railroad
Company.
Mr. Walker was an invalid for a num
ber or years and finally succumbed to
heart trouble.
CHAMBERS EXONERATED.
Coroner Hill held an inquest yesterday
upon the body of Dan Hayes, the colored
stable foreman .1 the Ingleside racetrack
who was shot and killed lost Sunday
night by Zip Chambers, another "colored
gentleman" in the horse racing business
and an employe of the unsavory Corrigan
The testimony was to the effect that
the deceased was a very quarrelsome per-
Bon and had frequently threatened to kill
his sluyer. The trouble had its origin, as
already told, in Chicago, where Chambers
succeeded In getting away from Hayes
several "exercising" boys.
About a week before the killing Hayes
hunted for Chamber! in a saloon near the
racetrack, and drawing his revolver
threatened to kill him. but Chambers suc
ceeded in making his escape through a
side door of the saloon.
The Jury returned a verdict setting
forth that Hayes was a native of Ken
tucky, 28 years old. and that he died from
the effect of a gunshot wound in the
heart.
"And we do further find that said shot
was red by a pistol In the hands of Zip
Chambers in self-defense, and we declare
the same to be a clear case of justifiable
homicide."
Coroner Mill approved of the verdict
and discharged the Jury.
DRS. CRANZ AND
TEBBETS ALONE
ON THE BOARD
Dental Examiners in
Revolt.
STATE COMMISSION CRUMBLES
FOUR RESIGNATIONS ARE IN
GAGE'S HANDS.
Reputable Practitioners Declare That
the Vacancies Cannot Be Filled
by Men Who Value Their
Reputations.
The expected crash has come in the
State Board of Dental Examiners. Four
members of the board, aroused to Indig
nation by The Call's expose of the mis
deeds of Dr. P. F. Tebbets and disgust
ed with the inactivity of Governor Gnge.
which has been tantamount to conniv
ance, have resigned their positions on the
board and a flfth Is ready to follow their
example.
This promised .'\<-ti<">n on the part of \hr
Board of Dental Examiners leave*
only Dr. Tebbetfl and Dr. Louis T. Cranz
remaining a< active membira of the
W'pupl. Dr. Drucker la also a mtmbw. but
.d taken up what is practically a
permanent residence In Alaska and has
done nothing and expects to do nothing
In an official capacity.
Dr. Cranz naturally does not take km ily
to his official association with Dr. Tab
bets. It was Dr. Crani who precipitated
the scandal by bringing formal charges
of official misconduct against Dr. Tebbeu
It was Dr. Cranz who prompted his as
sociates to resign their positions by In
sisting that Dr. Tebbets was unworthy
of being a member of the board and the
other members were jeopardizing tinir
reputation! by remaining on the board
with him. it Ik not likely therefor* that
Dr. Cranz will allow his name to stand in
association much longer with thai of Teb
bets as the only other member of the
disrupt^ board. Bui Dr. Cram will not
resign for the present, preferring to await
developments. It may be that his deci
sion la well made.
Dr. Metcalf of Sacramento, it will be
remembered, was the first member of the
board to lead off with his resignation. He
was quickly followed by Dr. Biles of
Santa Cruz and now Dr. Q. S. Bachman.
the president of the board, and Dr. Moi>re.
the secretary, have also handed in their
resignations to Governor Gag*. Thi rerg
nations of Dr. Bliss, Dr. Kachman and
Dr. Moore have been surrounded by a
great deal of mystery which reputable
dentists are at a loss to understand.
There Is no record of the resignations in
the office of Governor Gage anc* some of
those who are "wise" to he methods
of the Governor .-i:- suspicious. They are
afraid that the resignations may be lost
and that his Excellency, who sees in them
a repudiation of his peculiar policy, may
refuse to accept them.
The cautious one! are waiting: there
fore to see an acceptance of the resigna
tions. Dr. Cranz Is consequently waiting
for developments before he hands in his
resignation. He says thai the usefulness
of the IÂ«oard has been utterly destroyed
and the gieatest discredit ..as been cast
upon the profession by the scandal and Its
results.
Governor Gage will now have an oppor
tunity to place in office men to his liking
or perhaps he will permit Dr. Teb! â¢ to
Dame his associates. There Is among local
dentists an emphatic opinion that the
Governor will find the greatest difficulty
in inducing reputable dentists to accept
what Dr. Bliss, Dr. Metcalf, Dr. Bachman
and Dr. Moore huvo thrown away. It may
be, therefore, that the State Board of
Dental Examiners under Gage will bo a
State Institution only In name unless
some m sans is discovered to get Tebb^ts
off the board. When Dr. Cranz resigns
Tebbetf will he alone In his glory. This
condition cf affair? is perhaps without a
parallel in the history of State institu
tions. __^__^________
TO CONTEST THE OFFICE.
Tax Collector Sheehan Will Not Give
Up Without a Struggle.
Tax Collector Sheehan has signified his
intention to test the matter of J. H.
Scott's eligibility to the office for which
the latter received the highest number
of votes at the last election. Mr. Shee
han will have a conference with his
bondsmen to-day or to-morrow and will
be guided by their advice in the matter.
Tine courts will be asked to pass on that
provision of the charter which expressly
provides that an office holder must have
been a duly qualified elector for at least
live years previous to his assumption of
office. The point was raised during the
campaign and an an affidavit was filed by
Scott's brother-in-law thai Scott was â 
resident of San Jose up to three years
past, but Scott denied this charge, and
evidently the voters paid no attention to
It, as Scott was elected by a safe plu
rality over Doolan, the Democratic can
didate.
