day, and a rumor was started that
it went to intercept a vessel from
San Francisco earning Gatling
guns, rifles and ammunition to
the Yaquis. The gunboat has not
returned, but rumor says that it

Guaymas is full of Yaquis
working at all sorts of occupa

produce and manned by Yaquis
arrived yesterday from the river.
They report that when the troops
reached Yicam on Friday the
town was deserted and no fighc

A body of Indians met the
troops on the march toward the
town and held them in check un
til the Yaquis had left the town,
and then they disappeared in the
woods. The main body of the
Indians, including women and
children, crossed on a raft to the
north bank of the river, made a
detour behind the troops and
escaped to the mountains.
The Yaqui Indians' loss in the

GROCERS TRY TO FIX

NEW YORK. Aug. 17.â A committee
representing the National Wholesale
Grocers' Association is in the city f â¢ >r
the purpose of getting refiners to devise
Borne plan of enforcing the factor
agreement. The members called at the
offices of the independent refiners to
day and conferred with the managers
of those concerns in regard to th
nation. The most important visit, how
ever, was to Arbuckle brothers, the
chief competitors of the American Su
gar Refining Company. The result of
the conference was not made public.
The committee also had a conference
with representatives of the American
Sugar Refining Company. It was inti
mated to the members that the com
pany was in accord with the effort to
keep up and enforce the factor plan,
but the grocers themselves must be
looked to to enforce the agreement.
Under this agreement grocers who sell
on the agreed price are assured of a

Copyrighted, I 8Â», by the Associated Press.
RENNES, Aug. 18.â The
trial by court-martial of
Captain Dreyfus was re
sumed at y.2-, this morning with
! out incident. Colonel Picquart
continuing his testimony. He
spoke in the same loud, fearless
! tone and commenced by declar
ing that he thought it necessary
to reply to General Roget's verit
able arraignment of him. Gen
; eral Zurlinden, General Billot,
; General Roget and General Mer
rier were present. General Roget
lat the outset of Colonel Pic
quart's remarks interposed and
said he would reply to them.
. Colonel Picquart proceeded to
discuss the secret dossier as the
, mainspring of the condemnation
of Dreyfus. He took up the con
sideration of the documents sue
: cessively. referring to the writers
and persons addressed as "A"
and "B." occasionally treating of
the "Cette canaille de D "
': document.
RENNES. Aug. 17.â M. Roget, M.
Bertulus. the investigating mag
istrate; the widow of the late
Lieutenant Colonel Henry and
Colonel Picquart were on the
: stand to-day.
Mme. Henry, after M. Bertulus had
j deposed, asked leave to speak. She
â¢ stood up in a stagy manner, raised
; her left hand and said: "I ask to be
heard. ' She wanted to contradict what
M. Bertulus had said regarding the
I friendship of her husband and Ester
hazy. She would be a handsome woman
' did not the vulgarity of the drinking
i house she originally came from cling
.to her. Subaltern officers revolve
around her. but Mercier and the other
1 officers among whom she sits seem
embarrassed by her presence. What
she said was a tirade learned by heart
1 and scarcely evidence. It, however,
! was not wide of some points that It
i Bertulus brought out. She wanted to
show that M. Bertulus could not pos
sibly have wrung an avowal from
Henry that he and Esterhazy formed
lan association of traitors. Her story
coincided with what General Roget
Bald on this subject. So far from Ber
tulus appearing to suspect Henry and
j crushing the latter with words of sus
picion, she said her late husband had
described that magistrate as "charm
ing." She said Bertulus even embraced
' Henry when the latter was taking his
leave, a circumstance which struck the
j wife when she heard of it as boding no
good. She jumped to the conclusion
th^t falsehood lay behind the kiss and
that If. Benulus was a Judas.
This idea she then developed in a
passionate peroration that seemed a
lesson learned by heart. Mme. Henry
was very like the late Mme. A gar. the
! actress, as she indulged in this piece of
dramatic vengeance.
Bertulus felt that it would never do
I to argue with her. for tears were stand
ing in her eyes and the Judges were
looking Sympathetic. Po he said that
he preferred saying nothing to a lady
w hose grief he respected and whose
angry excitement he pardoned.
General Roget again to-day showed
; extraordinary forensic ability. Ido not
know what the military worth is of th â 
generals . wbo are acting here as wit
nesses, but I do not wonder at the old
i Judges of the Court of Cassation being
', jealous of their argumentative capaci
ty, their skill in turning a case inside
out, in puzzling innuendo, in casuistry,
i and in elegant verhal facility. Mercier
;is wonderful in these respects. Billot
is not inferior to him. but Roget is the
i superior of both in forensic skill, acu-
the Guilt of the Accused
men and suggestiveness. Roget Is a
very able man. He is the son of a gen
darme in the Pyrenees, and obtained
his commission by passing the exami
nations. He is fair, rather English
looking in features and cool and delib
erate in manner. He speaks distinctly
and rather slowly, but does not fall into
the defect into which Mme. Henry fell, !
of making every syllable a long one.
Dreyfus was under Roget as an out
aider with the general staff, and seemed i
tortured by his arguments and points
that he made â points that went home
to the military Judges and were in
tended to poison their minds. Finally
he could stand it no longer and, start
ing up, his eyes gleaming with anger,
he cried: "You deal only in argumen
tations. I have listened to you for
hours without hearing a single fact."
There were, nevertheless, some facts
to-day, but they were adduced to de- j
stroy the credit of Colonel Picquart,
who was represented, when the head of \
the intelligence department, as playing
a crooked part and keeping back every 'â¢
piece of information unfavorable to i
Dreyfus.
Maitre Demange made many happy
points in putting questions to General
Roget, who dodged them with presence
of mind and address, and, when in a
corner, with cool impudence. Still
Roget had the ear of the court. He
knows how to speak to specialized mili
tary minds.
The evidence of M. Bertulus was, on
the whole, favorable to Dreyfus, in the
judgment of civilian listeners. Unfor
tunately his reputation is blown upon.
He belonged, when at Nice, to the
South Railway gang, and as the magis
trate sent to investigate their swindle
played into their hands. Roget alluded
to this and to other doings of Bertulus
and showed that he did not respect
him. M. Bertulus is an epicurean and
has shocked Rennes people by his
rather gay relations with a former ac
tress, who, somehow, rolls in riches.
Still, he seems to be a fair and truth
ful witness and his deposition must
affect the public. Colonel Picquart
will be heard again to-morrow.
M. Labori's assailant is still undis
covered. At a convent of Marists, at
Cosson, near Rennes, the brothers
are vainly searching fur him. This has
won sympathy for the clerical party,
as it was thought a brotherhood might
shelter him. A hypothesis that seems
nearer to the truth is that he is a
soldier, who was given a suit of cloth-
Ing and told where to exchange it for
a uniform, which he could again don
as so.>n as Labori was shot. I can
imagine a Breton soldier, brimful of
hatred <>f thÂ« Jews and "that traitor,
Dreyfus." taking his life in his hands
and going resolutely to kill Labori.

MANY SENSATIONS
AT DREYFUS' TRIAL
Bertulus and Picquart Declare That
They Believe the Accused Is
Innocent.
REXXES, Aug. IT.â With the usual
attendance and without any note
worthy incident the second trial by
court-martial of Captain Alfred Drey
fus, charged with treason, was resumed
this r, irning in the Lycee. Previous to
th<^ opening of the proceedings it be
came known that Maitre Labori. lead
ing counsel for Dreyfus, who was shot
in the back from ambush Monday, was
slightly worse to-day. His physicians
have not yet extracted the bullet, his
fever continues to increase and it is
not believed he will he able to attend
court Monday. Consequently Maitre
Monard. counsel for the Dreyfus fam
ily before the Court of Cassation in the
trial revision proceedings, has been
summoned to replace M. Labori until
such time as the latter is able to re
sume conduct of the case.
Friends prevented Maitre Albert
Clemeneeau from coming to the assist
ance of Dreyfus, as planned immediate
ly after the assassination of M. Labori.
j However, in spite of the difficulties en
countered by the defense, to-day's ses-
I sion of the court opened with brighter
prospects for the prisoner, as M. De
mange of- counsel for the defense evi
j der.tly came primed with questions to
I be put to General Roget. The latter re
PKICE FIVE CEXTS.
sumed his deposition on the opening of
the court, dealing â with the theft of the
Esterhazy letters from Mile. Pays. A
number of the counsel's shots struck
the bullseye and made the general
squirm in his seat.
General Roget was unable to conceal
his annoyance and anger when M.
Demange scored. The witness' fingers
twitched nervuusly and he frequently
turned for consolation toward General*
Billot and Zurlinden, former Ministers
of War, who occupied the witness'
seats behind him. The general also
threw glances of savage resentment at
the audience when, as happened several
times, suppressed titters went around
the courtroom when M. Demange cor
nered him. Finally General Roget be
came quite red in the face and an
swered M. Demange in a hollow voice,
contrasting strangely with his confi
dent tone of yesterday.
Then came a witness who proved to
be a splendid reinforcement for Drey
i fus. It was M. Eertulus. the examin
! ing magistrate who received the late
! Lieutenant Colonel Henry's confession
!of forgery. In almost inaudible tones,
owing to hoarseness, M. Bertulus gave
his testimony, which was a veritable
speech for the defense. Coming from
a man of the high legal reputation of
M. Bertulus, this evidence raised the
hopes of the Dreyfusards immediately,
and it apparently made a deep impres
sion on the members of the court.
M. Jaures, the Socialist leader, who
was among those present in court, re
marked on the conclusion of the mag
istrate's testimony: "This is the first
time the truth and the whole truth has
been told before the judges."
Dreyfus displayed the keenest inter
| est in the statements of M. Bertulu*.
seeming completely absorbed in his
words and straining forward to catch
every syllable.
After a brief confrontation of M.
Bertulus and Mme. Henry, widow of
Lieutenant Colonel Henry. Colonel Pic
quart, formerly Chief of the Intelli
gence Bureau, was called. He gave his
evidence in a loud, resonant voice and
i created a profound impression. The fol-
I lowing is the testimony in detail:
General Roget, on resuming his testi
mony, criticized the surveillance inaugu
rated by Colonel Picquart over Lieut<jn
ant Colonel Henry. This surveillance, he
| said, lasted several months and included
! the interception of letters address
Bsterhaxy. There had also been searches
lof Henry's house during his absence. All
these measures, the witness asserted,
were carried out without the authorizj
tlon of the Minister of War, who was not
even informed of them. Moreover, he as
serted the investigations were carried on
at the expense of the secret service fund.
The witness also objected to Colonel Pic
quart's methods of watching Mile. Pays.
In regard to Esterhazy. General Roget ad
miued the former was a gambler and an
immoral character, but he asserted ""while
I have acknowledged his little failings I
nevertheless maintain he has been the
victim of abominable persecution."
General Roget next spoke of the arrest
at Belfort of Quenelli. declaring that Pic
quart cooked up the allegations of spying
against Quenelli In order to attract to
himself the approval of his superiors.
The witness then dwelt upon the alleged
devices of Dreyfus to procurer information
from the various bureaus in regard to the
mobilization and concentration of the>
troops, pointing out that while intelligent
and industrious, Dreyfus was "far too in
quisitive in matters which did not con
cern him, to the detriment of his proper
duties."
Replying to a question of the court.
General Roget replied that so far as he
knew Dreyfus had only once been given
an Imaginary task as a test.
The prisongr listened intently to the wit
ness, Dreyius' self control contrasting
markedly with his excitement of yester
day.
M. Demange- asked Colonel Jouaust,
president ot' the court-martial, to request
General Roge.t to repeat the explanations
which he had given before the Court of
Cassation in regard to the part plav^i In
the affair by Major Dv Paty de Clam,
whereupon the witness traversed the old
ground In regard to Dt Clam's
toward Esterhazy in the campaign
to be organizing against him. The gen
eral said he believed the forged "Spor
anza" letters wera either written bj !â :
Paty de Clam or instigated by him. Wit
ness said he had not acted agair
' 'lam because he saw nothing culpable in
what he had done to sav<> Bsterhazy.
With reference to t'nÂ»- document Libera
tor, a document forged in order to se
cure the release of Esterhazy whÂ»-n h- was
court-martialed. General Roget said he
only knew how it reached the Ministry of
War. addir.g that its disappearance from
that Ministry was a mystery. But. he
said, doubtless De Clam could explain the
matter.
Counsel for the defense hero wanted to
know how. under such circumstances, De
Clam's intervention in behalf of Ester
hazy could be explained. But the wit
ness could only attribute it to Dv Paty
fie Clam's moral conviction of Ester
hnzy's innocence.
"'ln any case." said thÂ» general, "the
general staff must be entirely disassoci
ated with the part played by Dv Paty de
Clam in this matter."
"Certainly." replied M. Demange.
"I attach great importance to this
point." was the general's next remark.
M. Demange assented to this, but add
ed: "What I would like to know is how
an innocent man like Esterhazy was
thought to need this kind of help."
(Laughter. Â»
"It is certain I should not have done It."
answered the witness, which caused re
newed laughter.
General Roget then added that although
he would not have Intervened himself â¦â¢2
SEVEN MEN KILLED BY
AN EXPLODING BOILER
Heavy Mountain Locomotive on the Mexi
can Central Railway Blown to Pieces
Near Cardenas.
AT'PTIX. Aug. 17.â A dispatch from Tampico, Mex.. states that the
boiler of a locomotive on the Mexican Centrul Railroad exploded yester
day, killing seven men and fatally wounding three others. The locomo
tive was standing Oh the sidetrack at Cardenas when the explosion
occurred. It was of a special pattern and of great size, being used to
haul train? Un thf mountain. Among the killed are four American
engineers, \\ hÂ«. were in the cab and near tho scene of the accident.
Their names are: Simon, Fitzgerald, Hussey and Gibson. Another
American enfrineer named Lockhftrt was standing near the locomotive
when the explosion occurred. He was hurled over 100 feet and fell,
. Injured. The other men killed were three Mexican firemen and
wood -passers. The great engine was completely wrecked !>y the ex
ploelon. Heavy pieces of iron were scattered over the mountain.
save Esterhazy he did not consider the j
course foil .â â¢! as being reprehensible.
M. Demange then questioned â  "' witness i
ivn to what he thought of Esterhazy a |
attempt to obtain from an agent a dec.a- <
ration that he had had nothing to do with ;
the affair to which the general replied,
that he knew nothing â â¢;' such an attempt,
But when M. Demange read General He- i
naud's report on the subject General Ro- ;
get- admitted that Esterhazy's action was
a curious proceeding tor an Innocent man >
to take. , ,
Counsel then invited the special atten
tion of the court-martial to the witness ;
reply. Then he took the general to task .
for playing yesterday the part of general
accuser, particularly toward Colonel 1 lc- .
quart. During the course of his remarks
M. TH-mnnge referred to the document i
Known as the Petit bleu and the erasures ,
on it. The general admitted the erasures
might have been made with the view to ;
giving the document a suspicious appear- I
ance. But he claimed Plcquart made the â 
erasures and Inserted the name of Ester
hazy ait. taking the photograph einlo- j
II .; before the Court of Cassation. The.
counsel insisted the falsification occurred ;
after the Petit bleu left Plcquart s hands, j
and demanded further explanations from j
the witness. The general, however, said
he was unable to testify as to who falsi- |
lied the document or when it was done, j
but he did not think it was done with the
view of compromising Picquart.
At this juncture there was a little spar- ;
ring between M. Demang and Major ;
Carriere, the representative of the *â "â¢>"
ernment in the case. The former desired j
information in regard to the espionage of i
Basle Switzerland., and the recall on |
account of peculation of an agent named j
Lajout. who was corresponding with a j
tain foreign 'â¢ agent. Major Carriere
obiected to the discussion of the subject j
at" this stage; for he said it would be i
contrary to the spirit of discipline for the j
general* to u'.pcuss the subject, The court :
upheld the contention of the Govern- ;
merit's representative and M. Demange i
continued his examination of General
Roget. , , 3
â  "How was it you knew, counsel asked ,
the ; witness, "that GOO.OOO francs were of- j
fored Esterhazy if he would confess to j
being the author of the bordereau?"
â â [ heard It," 'the witness replied, "from;
the court of inquiry, which tried Lster
hazy, and from Esterhazy himself."
â¢'Ah," exclaimed counsel. "it was
Ksterhazv who said it. Just so." (Laugh- j
ter. )
"Why was his residence searched?" M. :
'Dem.-irige then ... and the General |
answered: "Esterhazy at w one time had j
the document containing the words "Cetle
Canaille d<: Dâ " and might therefore have ;
had others."
â  "You admit then." asked M. Demange, ,
"that he might have had interesting ;
documents?"
"When one is conducting an inquiry. â 
said the witness, "he must expect any
thing and .search accordingly.',' , . |
"Admitting.'" counsel then said, "that
Esterhazy was (.he agent of the Dreyfus

' These statements of the general con- . â 
vufsed" the court with laughter, which ! ,
seemed to irritate the witness, who was
growing nervous under the searching ex- | .
amination of counsel.
Turning to Dreyfus, General Roget !
cried in a loud voice: "I know very well |
that if I was accused of an act of treason i
which I had not committed. I should and ! '
arguments with which to defend myself." \ 'â 
This assertion evoked murmurs, but the , '
general shouted: "Why does he deny
even the most obvious things?"
M. Demange shrugged his shoulders and j
.ejaculated: "Ah!" '
' The prisoner, however, rose and em- j â¢
pbatically denied point blank some of the i
general's evidence. He said he never :
traced on a map any plan of concentration | '
Â»r .mobilization, nor had any knowledge- â¢â : I
details of those movements, nor of the
plan for the distribution of the various
units throughout the departments.
"â Let- us," said Dreyfus, "understand one :
another in regard to. what is meant. I as- j
sert that 1 did not know In its details of â¢
the plan of concentration. In regard to ;
the circumstance dwelt upon by you yes
le-rday, there was no precise statement.
There was nothing but argument."
The audience here gave vent to expres- â 
sions of absent and dissent.
,M. Bertulus, the examining magistrate,
fwass the next witness. There had been j
lively anticipations of an Interesting con
frontation. The magistrate inquired into >
the charges made against Esterhazy by â 
Ids cousin. Christian, and it was expected

The. magistrate repeated the whole story
with emphasis, and it had a great effect
un.on the audience. . â â â .'â¢>':
.After recapitulating his other evidence
before the Court of Cassation M. Bertulus i
energetically affirmed his belief in tho
Innocence of Dreyfus. He declared the
bordereau was In three pieces and not iii
little bits. Hr also said It did not reach
the War Department by the ordinary '
channels. M. Bertulus said' his belief in- i
the Innocence of Dreyfus was based on !
documents in the secret dossier which he .
had seen But what, above all, confirmed I
the" witness In his belief was the entire
absence of a motive which could have
tempted Dreyfus to commit such a crime. \
"Without a motive." emphatically 6e- j
clared the experienced magistrate, "there I
WAS no crime." I
The earnestness with which M. Bertulus
insisted upon the innocence of the ac- i
cused created a profound impression upon
his hearers.
"You have been told," he said, "that
Dreyfus is guilty. For myself, I believe
find' believe profoundly In his innocence. ;
In coming here to tell you so you will
understand that my conscience, tells me
that In so doing I am performing a duty
an absolute duty. The Court of Cassa
tion has declared the bordereau to be tn

tion is the supreme authority In all mat
ters of justice in France." (sensation.)
At this Juncture there was a brief sus
pension of the session. When it was re
sumed M. Bertulus was recalled, but he
had little to add of an interesting char
acter.
When the prisoner was asked if he de
sired to put any questions to the witness
he answered in the negative.
Mme. Henry then ascended the platform
and. standing I eside M. Bertulus, she
said: "on July is, th" day my husband
called on M. Bertulus, the colonel, in the
course of a conversation that evening.
told me he had a friendly and charming
reception. He described how the magis
trate advanced to meet him and held out
his arms. I said to my husband: "Are you
sure of this man? Are you sure he Is
sincere? i am very niuch'afraifl that his
kiss was the kiss of a Judas.' "
Th< re was a great sensation in court at
this statement of Mme. Henry.
"1 was not wrong." she continued, amid
the breathless Interest of the court. "This
man is indeed the Judas I Imagined."
Referring to the papers which arrived
at the same time as the bordereau. Mme.
Henry said: "Those papers were not all
torn into a thousand pieces. I was able
to note that personally. Letters often
came entire. M. Bertulus lias maintained
that everything arrived in pieces. That
is false."
The court here resounded with exclama
th ns of surprise, and Mme. Henry con
cluded, "l have nothing more to say."
M. Bertulus said he did not desire to re
ply to Mm--. Henry, adding: "She is only
a woman."
"1 am not a woman." exclaimed Mme.
Henry furiously, "1 speak In the name -of
my husband."
The lncid< m caused great excitement In
i â  iurt
"Now Bhall I reply to madame?" asked
-M- Bertulus. "She is. defending the name
of a dead man and that of her child."
â¢ Renewi d sensation. I
After gazing steadfastly at M. Bertulus,
who was greatly moved, Mme. Henry de
scended from the platform and took a
seat beside General Zurlinden. M. Bertu
lui forthwith left the court.
Colonel Plcquart was then called to the
witness stand. He protested most firmly
-t all suspicion of having caused the
ppearance of any document relating
t" Dreyfus. Documents had disappeared,
bm he was not connected with their disap
;â â  .car.. . . He aisn r< i". lied with scorn the
ftion that he had endeavored to put
another officer in th>- place of the r.-al
author of the bordereau.
"It is true," the witrit-^ continued,
"that the name of Captain Dorval being
mentioned to me as a dangerous man I
had him watched, and do you know, gen
tlemen, by whom Dorval was denoui
By his own cousin," continued Picquart,
"Mnjur Dv Paty de Â»"iam (Sensation.)
Colonel Picquart then next proc< ided
reply to the various attacks made upon
him.
"These tactics," he said, "are evidently
pursued with the object of lessening the
value of my testimony."
The colonel next outlined his connection
with Dreyfus at the military college and
afterward at the Ministry of War. where,
. to the anti-Semitic prejudic t the
gl '.' r .i\ staiT. he lirst appointed Dreyfus
to a department where probationers had
irect cognizance of the secret docu
ments. !!â¢â  then described the consterna
tion in the War Office when the treason
was discovered and the relief experienced
when it was thought the guilty person
had been discovered, it was then that
the witness discovered the similarity be
tween the handwriting of Dreyfus and
that of the bordereau, and he had re
course to Dv Paty de Clam, "who was
supposed to have grapholugical knowl
edge." (Laughter.)
Then the witness described what he
characterized as "the Irregular steps
t.-ik-Mi by General Mercier to accomplish
the arrest of Dreyfus." Referring to the
dictation test, the witness earnestly and
emphatically affirmed that Yf saw- no
signs of perturbation in the handwriting
of Dreyfus on that occasion, and. more
over, shortly afterward Dv Paty de
Clam admitted that he had not found
a fresh charge against Dreyfus.
"Beyond the bordereau." said the wit
ness, "there was nothing against Dreyfus
absolutely nothing."
"My impression during the investiga
tion," continued Colonel Picquart, "was
that tho acquittal of the accused was
1-robable, as the evidence was insufli
cient."
Witness believed he had even told tho
Minister of War that the condemnation
of the accused could not be secured un
less the court-martial had been shown the
Becret documents which it had been
agreed to submit to the court. The colonel
next declared that In 1394 he did not know
the contents of the secret dossier, but he
believed, like all other officers, that it
contained frightful proofs against the
ner. when ho became acquainted
with its contents, however, he found that
his "earlier impressions were entirely
wrong.",, (Prolonged sensation.)
Colonel Plcquart then recalled the vehe
ment protests of innocence -which the
prisoner had not ceased to mak<e during
all [.bases of the degradation. The wit
ness declared he was unite ignorant of
the confessions Dreyfus is alleged to have
made to Captain Lebrun-Renaud.
Continuing, Colonel Plcquart defended
himself against the charge that he bad
always directed his efforts toward the re
habilitation of Dreyfus. He said he bad
only directed the investigations made to
that end when he became aware that the
writings of Bsterhazy and the bordereau
were identical, and that consequently the
charges against Dreyfus no longer ex
isted.
During the course of his testimony
( olone] Picquart asked to be confronted
With Major dv Paty de Clam and to be
permitted to "deal with some of his pecu
ltarities when Paty de Clam is in the wit
ness box."
Next the colonel examined the borde
reau, and declared Dreyfus could not
li.-r. â¢â  disclosed part of it.
Regarding the Madagascar note the
witness disputed its value, and sn'id he
did not believe it was a confidential note
He added that if Dreyfus, in his capacity
of probationer, bad asked the witness for
the note lie would have handed it to him
immediately. Therefore he (Picrjuarti was
unable to understand the sentence in the
bordereau reading. "This document was
very difficult to obtain."
Colonel Plcquart then declared he had
never seen Dreyfus copy the smalbnt
document in the Wr.r Department. In the
opinion of the witness the department
where the bordereau was discovered ought
to have been searched when the discovery
was made. This, he explained, was ,hÂ«.
department in which Dv Paty de Clam
worked, and that, was the department
which was working on the plan of the
concentration of the troops and the Mad
agascar expedition. He added:
"It was in Major Dv Paty de dam's
department that the search should have
been made, or rather in his private room
where he worked quite alone " (S"n<i
t lon. i
Dv Paty de Clam, continued the wit
ness, had been guilty of grave imprudence
in having, contrary to the regulations,
had confidential documents copied by sin
gle secretaries, non-commissioned officers
and even private soldiers; whereas the
custom was that such work was done
solely by officers.
Later on the witness said he wondered if
It was not to avoid the risk of punish
ment that Dv Paty de c| a m advanced the
date of the reception of the bordereau at
the intelligence department, so as to
make it prior to the date of his fDu Paty
de clams) arrival in the department
(Sensation.)
At 11:45 a. m. the court adjourned for
the day.
TITE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, AUGUST 18, ]S}>:>.
CALIFORNIA BOYS A DAY
NEARER THEIR HOME PORT
THE transport Sherman with the California boys aboard is rapidly approaching San Francisco, and next Monday
at noon she will not be much more than three days' steaming away from the Golden date.
According to the calculationsÂ©* United States Nautical Expert McMillan the Sherman was at noon yester
day (San Francisco time) in latitude 41 degrees north, longitude 16S degrees 40 minutes west. In that event sho
was a little over 2100 nautical miles from San Francisco and is averaging, her twelve knots an hour or a little better.
The Sherman on this trip has some of the finest steaming coal in the world in her bunkers, and this will probably
make a difference of several hours in her time. With all allowances for and against, the calculations still are that
she will get here on the afternoon of the 24th or the morning of the 25th.
On account of the crowds that assemble in front of the window on the Market street side of the business office of The
Call it is almost impossible nowadays for pedestrians to paps by. A large facsimile of the map shown above is the draw
!nV card, arid the attention it attracts indicates the great interest taken by San Franciscans in the course of the good ship
that is bringing the valiant California boys nearer home day by day. At night the crowds are every bit as big.
EXTRA SESSION
DECIDED UPON
Thus Declares Assem
blyman Mead.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
T.OS ANGELES, Aug. 17.â Members
of the Legislature representing dis
tricts in Los Angeles County are now j
convinced that an extra session is on
the tapis, to be held before the end of
November. Assemblyman William
Mead (D.), who recently visited the
northern part of the State, says that
while in San Francisco he was the ,
guest of a Republican member of the j
lower House, whose family is very in- i
timate with that of the Democratic)
member from Los Angeles.
"This man, 1 know, is close to the
Republican powers that be." said Mr.
Mead to-day, "and he informed meâ
not in any particular confidence, by the t
way -that I might ,lust as well prepare |
when I got home to go to Sacramento
Borne time between the middle of Octo- .
her and the middle of November, for
an extra session of the Legislature
would surely be called to convene
within that time.
â¢â¢He informed me that sixty-one Re- i
publicans would by October 1 sign an 1
agreement to go Into caucus upon the
United States Senatorship, which
would mean that thirty-one votes
would elect. The caucus call will not
favor Daniel M. Hums, Irving M. Scott j
or any other particular candidate, the
signers simply agreeing to vote for a
Republican." , .
There are evidences that members of
the Los Angeles County delegation,
have recently been Bounded upon the
advisability of a caucus and an extra
session. Assemblyman M. P. Conrey.is
among those who have been asked how
they now stand on the question. MX.
Conrey told his questioners that his at- |
titude would depend entirely upon the
circumstances existing after the Legis
lature had convened in extra session
under tho call of Governor Gage.
ONE FORGERY THAT
WILL AID ACCUSED
â 
PARIS, Aug. 17.â A special edition of
Figaro exposes another alleged forgery
in the Dreyfus case by publishing the
' following telegram from Ems:
"The letter of November 30, 1898, at
tributed to me and reproduced in the
; Figaro of August 16 ' .^^^g^f^'
The letter referred to was one from
Schneider, the Austrian military at
tache at Paris, in which he was alleged ,
to have said Schwarzkoppen and Pan- j
I izzardl respectively the German and j
Italian attaches, were trying to make
out that it was not Dreyfus who was
i giving them information, and adding
that he had no belief in these protes- j
: tations M Cavaignae, the former
Minister of War, in his testimony made
a. great point of this. '
Commenting on the forgery the F -
earo says: "We are sending this tel- j
em-am to Colonel Jou.iust, president of i
i the court-martial, who certainly will !
1 not hesitate to call upon General Mer
cier General Roget and others to Â«x
--plain how they came to make such a
I great point of this forgery in their evi
donee "â - * â 
EtENNES, Aug. 17..The publication
by the Figaro of the Schneider tele
gram, exposing an alleged forgery, j
! caused a great sensation here, and to- j
! night the general impression is that i
' Schneider's disavowal has dealt a se
i vere blow to the prosecution, killing the
only point in General Mercier's cvi
' dence that was dangerous to Dreyfus.
| It is expected that the matter will be
brought up in court to-morrow by M.
Demange, who has a splendid oppor
tunity to drive a nail into the coffin
j of the prosecution.
PARIS POLICE WILL
WAIT FOR GUERIN
PARIS, Aug. 17.â M. Guerin still holds
the fort. Barricades were erected at
both extremities of the Rue Chabrol this |
afternoon, and the police were constantly i
enraged In repulsing crowds.
M Guerin frequently appeared at a
window, earnestly regarding the ap
proaches, as though, expecting a rescue.
A band of anti-Gtierin demonstrators
was followed and was roughly handled
by a band of anti-Semites, whose en
thusiasm for Ouerin is becoming so
fanatical that they are making a list of
all who dare to insult him. The latter's
lLvrs are considered to be endangered.
Demonstrations in the Rue Chabrol
this evening led to several conflicts, but
otherwise there has been no change In the
position up to a late hour.
According to the Figaro the Govern
ment has decided not to use force, but
to wait -until M. Guerin issues forth.
MME. LABORI RECEIVES
THREATENING LETTERS
RENNES, Aug. 17.â M. Labori was

his room. To-night the doctors think
he will be able to be present at next

BLOW DEALT TO
ELECTRIC ROADS
Single Trolley System
Illegal.
Ppeclal Dispatch to The Call.
SPOKANE, Aug. 17.â Electric street
railway companies must so construct
their lin^s that none of the electricity
may stray off to- eat holes in iron and
steel water and gas pipes. This, in
brief, was the decision handed down in
the Superior Court to-day. It Is said
to be the first judicial decision ever
rendered on the question of electrolysis.
The case has been under advisement
over a year, and some of the most
prominent electrical experts in the
country gave testimony during the
hearing.
The local gas company claimed its
mains were being ruined by stray cur
rents from the lines of the Spokane
Street Railway and produced per
forated iron pipes in proof thereof. Tho
railway company uses the overhead
system, with a single trolley. The de
cision condemns this system. The court
announced it would give the street car
company a reasonable time to install a
new system wh.'ch will prevent stray
electric current^ or. if that is not done,
it will grant a perpetual injunction
agninsi the operation ot the system.
The decision finds "that the only
method of absolutely preventing stray
currents of electricity is the double
trolley system; that the best single
trolley system is the cast-welded joint
system; that the best wire bond is that
known as the Chicago bond; that it is
not practicable to use cast-welded
joints except when the street is paved
with such material as asphalt, brick,
macadam, wooden blocks or similar
material."
An appeal will be taken to the State
Supreme Court.
TIDE HAS TURNED
IN FAVOR OF DREYFUS
LONDON*, Aug. 17.â The dispatch in the
Morning Post from Remits indicates tho
activity of the censorship there. General
Merci( is Insulting references to Emperor
William making certain allusions to the
secret dossier were suppressed, while
General Merder's utterances were toned
down.
The correspondents of the London morn
ing newspapers are, however, unanimous
in the opinion that the tide has finally
turned in favor of Dreyfus. The evidence
yesterday (Thursday) was so favorable to
him that even some of the anti-Dreyfus-
Ites would fain admit that the scales were
falling from their eyes. Madame Henry's
dramatic characterization of M. Bertulus
as "Judas" failed of the intended effect,
because he Immediately handed Colon, i
.Touaust, president of the court-martial, an
anonymous letter he had received proving
the whole scheme prearranged.
All the correspondents also remarked
the grateful demeanor of Dreyfus on
hearing, for the first time, witnesses in
his favor.
The correspondent of tho Dally Chroni
cle predicts that Dreyfus will be recon
demned and that the sentence will be im
mediately ciimmnted through fear of ex
citement and uprisings incidental upon
an acquittal. He believes that the lati
tude allowed the generals in court points
to submission to what in France Is a
sacred image, "reasons of state."
The correspondent of the Times com
ments upon the change which came over
the aspect of affairs when Maitre De
mange began tentatively to cross-examine
the witnesses, his questions leaving Gen
eral Roget utterly disconcerted. His re
marks, too, upon the fact that Colonel
Jouaust failed to confront Roget with
Bertulus, whose evidence therefore had
its full effect.
SHERIFF OFFERS REWARD.
Seeking to Bring Imsand's Murderers
to Justice.
REDWOOD CITY, Aug. 17.â Sheriff
J. H. Mansfield to-day made an offer
of $250 reward to any person who shall
give Information that will lead to the
conviction of the person- or persons who
murdered Joseph J. Imsand at Colma,
on Monday. The three Mitchells, who
are suspected of the crime, are in Jail
here, confined in separate apartments.
W. S. Barnes has been retained by the
elder Mitchell to defend them and it is
said that other counsel will figure in
the case. A complaint probably will be
filed against the Mitchells within a day
or two.

HOWARD MAY NOT
SHIRK HIS DEBT
Union Bank's Claim Is
Valid.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAX JOSE, Aug. 17.â Referee in
Bankruptcy Coulter to-day rendered
an important decision in the insolvency
case of E. B. Howard, the fruit shipper
who is accused of having wrecked the
Union Sayings Bank. By it the bank
gets the {237,000 indebtedness of How
ard that was disputed and the deposi
tors of the bank will receive a few
thousand dollars more on their ac
counts.
At the time of the failure of the bank
Howard owed it $312,675. When he
filed a petition in bankruptcy he
claimed that H. Ward Wright, presi
dent of the bank, had relinquished
$237,479 of the Indebtedness. In proof
of this he presented an agreement
signed by himself and by Wright, as
president of the bank, on June 28, 189 S.
whereby it was agreed "that all money
coming in to the credit of Howard &
Co. in payment for the season's fruit
business of 1897 shall -be applied on the
! indebtedness of Howard & Co. for said
season of IS!>7 and all money coming
in to the credit of Howard & Co. for the
present season's business shall be held
for his credit for business of 1898."
It was claimed this agreement estop
ped the bank from setting up any
claim for the sum. When the bank
presented its claim of $312,000, J. M.
Cox, a creditor of Howard, protested
and petitioned the referee to exclude
from the liabilities the $237,000 it was
alleged to have relinquished. It was
upon this that the decision was render
ed to-day.
The referee held the agreement was
not binding on the bank, as it was not
made with the sanction of the direc
tors. He said:
In this transaction Howard was the
beneficiary. The hank received nothing,
retained ' nothing. enjoyed nothing-.
Howard states he was bankrupt at
the time nnd he Is bankrupt now.
Besides, there is no evidence that it
was the usual course of business of the
bank for its president to give a release
and aeouittame without the sanction ami
outhbrity of Its directors. It is hold by
the Supreme <'ourt that neither a presi
dent nor a cashier Is empowered without
express authority from the board of di
rectors, to release the. maker of a note.
payable to and held by the bank, from his
ieg-al liability on such note. From the
facts and the law recited, I am forced to
; the conclusion that the petitioner has
; failed to establish the material allega
tions of his petition, and his prayer there
in for a reduction of the claim of the
Union Savings Bank is therefore denied.

"I propose to remain at this port
I about one week, then proceed to Leg

Genoa or Villafranca for about the
same period. From there I will go to

STORM STRIKES THE
COAST OF SCOTLAND
ABERDEEN, Scotland, Aug. 17.â A
terrific storm swept over the Scotch
coast last night. At Fraserburgh, a
town thirty-seven miles north of this
place on the northeast coast, three hun
dred fisTiing craft were caught in the
gale. O lifeboat was sent to their
I assistance.
The crew of the Diadem of Culten.
I a town on Culten Bay, were saved by
the gallantry, of James Brown, a dis
charged Dargi hero, who swam to the
boat with a line. When this line had
been fastened to the endangered craft
the spectators who gathered on the
shore dragged the Diadem through the
surf and landed her safely.
The sphooner Pioneer, from Sunder
land to Banff, thirty-eight miles north
of Aberdeen, with a cargo of coal, is
ashore, and it is feared that she will
become a total wreck. Her crew has
been safely landed by life savers.

Years Ago.
Special Dispat h to The Call.
SANTA BARBARA, Aug. 17.âLeo
pold Kutner, a retired merchant, placed
I a revolver to his temple early thia
! morning and blew out his brains. The
act was done in a fit of despondency
at his temporary home in this city. His
wife heard the shot fioiiF another room
and rushed in to find him lying on a
lounge with the ghastly wound in his
forehead and a pistol near at hand.
The Coroner was notified and an in
quest held at once. It was brought
out at the Inquest that Mr. Kutner had
been a sufferer from chronic gastritis
for many years.^Â»Three years ago he
came her*e and remained a year and a
half, when he thought he had entirely
recovered. He went back to Han Fran
cisco, but two months ago was advised
to return to Santa Barbara for his
again falling health. He, with his wife,
arrived on the first of this month and
rented the house in which he died.
Kutner undoubtedly had for some
days contemplated â¦suicide, for he told
several of his friends that he would put
a ball through his head unless he im
proved in health soon. He bought a
revolver from a local firm a day or so
s go and it was with this that he com
mitted suicide.
Kutner was a native of Poland and
57 years old. He was connected with
the Kutner-Ooldst-in Company, the
largest general merchandising company
in the State. It has stores in Fresno,
I Fowler, Selma, Hanford, Huron and
, Madera, and is a very wealthy com
pany. He was until recently the senior
partner of the firm of Kutner & Rosen -

HELPED TO CONSTRUCT
FAMOUS COLTON HALL
MONTEREY, Aug. 17.â The funeral
of one of California's earliest pioneers
took place in this city to-day. William
|D. Robinson, known throughout the
\ State as "Uncle Billy" Robinson, died
â  at his home here yesterday, of old ape,
I after a brief illness. He was a native
of New England and in his eighty
fourth year.
Robinson came to California with
I Stevenson's regiment of volunteers in
1848. and. when the regiment disbanded,
he settled in Monterey, where he resid
led since. He took an active part in
early events of California's statehood
| and was well known by all pioneers.

PAN JUAN, Porto Rico. Auk. 17.â
Visits to the most distressed districts
prove that the former reports of terri
ble conditions have, not been in the
least; exaggerated. The people in the
towns are huddled together anywhere
for shelter. In the country they are
Bleeping in the open air. The food sup

people will starve. Supplies from San

In many towns are already surrounded
by large numbers of hungry persons.
As far as Caguas and Cayey. the san
itary condition is not threatening, but
reports from towns further south state
that their condition is dangerous. The
peril lies in the herding of the inhabit
ants in the towns.
The military commander of Adiuntas
reports to headquarters by courier that
some of the provisions of the troops
were wet and much is useless. There
Is urgent need of sending aid. The sit
uation in the town is very serious.
An official report from Guaymas says
that 2G5 houses were destroyed and 204
damaged by storm. In Yabucoa the
police" are obliged to protect peasants
bringinc: fruit from the country in order
to prevent it ing taken away from
them .by force by hungry mobs. The
situation there Is most desperate.
Troops have been ordered to avoid
trouble with the inhabitants, who have
held a public gathering to find a solu
tion of the difficulties. The municipal
ity has. no means to buy food and asks
for lvln from General Davis.

TEN NEW VOLUNTEER
REGIMENTS CALLED FOR
Will Be Hurried to the Philippines for
Active Service as Soon as
Organized,
Special Dispatch to The Call.
âº ''ALL HEADQUARTERS, WELLINGTON HOTEL. WASHING
âº TON, Aug. 17. â Secretary' Root to-d.ay issued formal orders for the
â  organization of ten additional volunteer regiments for service In the
* Philippines. The regulars under orders to reinforce General Otis and
" the ten volunteer regiments already organized will reach Manila, as
* contemplated by the programme adopted to-day, by the latter part of
â  October and during October the Secretary desires that the regiments to
" be recruited shall sail for their destination. October 1 is given as the
âº limit for the organization of the 13.090 men required for the ten new
âº regiments. In appointing additional officers to command the new regi
* ments the President will be guided by the recoins and efficiency reports
âº furnished by the Secretary of War as he did In the case of those
"â  appointed to-day. He will not make a final decision in the number of
- cases, however, until some of the Governors of States have been heard
*" from. Governor Gage of California, for instance, having telegraphed
âº that he did not care to submit recommendations until the regiment of
âº California Volunteers, which has served in the Philippines, had re
âº turned to San Francisco.
"WASHINGTON, Aug. 17.â "The pol
icy of the War Department." said Sec
retary Root to-day, "Is to furnish Gen
eral Otis with all the troops and sup
plies that he can use and which are
necessary to wind up the Insurrection
in the Philippines in the shortest pos
sible time."
The Secretary was ppeaklng of the
ten regiments which were called out to
day by ord^r of the President. He said
that no delay would be allowed in en
listing, equipping and supplying the
new regiments already organized to
i the Philippines as soon as they were
, needed for active operations. If the
present number of transports are insuf
ficient more will be procured. The men
â¢ already enlisted for the Philippine serv
ice will be sent at once and the new
regiments will be forwarded as fast as
they are organized and needed. While
there has been some suggestion that
! the new regiments will be used as a re
serve force, it may be stated positively
that these regiments, as well as more
if they can be used, will be sent to
'reinforce General oiis.
Secretary Root sent a copy of the
order of to-day to the various depart
: ments of the army and they at once
: began preparations for supplying the
new organizations.
Within half an hour the Ordnance
i Bureau had sent orders to the different
: arsenals directing that complete out
! flta of arms and ordnance supplies for
; each regiment be sent to the rendez
vous where they are to be organized.
The Quartermaster's Department gave
orders for supplying; tents, clothing and
other equipments furnished by that de
partment, while the Commissary De
partment ordered a sufficient suppty of
rations to be on hand to feed the troops
a fast as they arrive. The Medical
Department was also directed to see^
that supplies were sent. The regi- y
ments will be recruited with the same
care exercised in enlisting the first ten
regiments.
ThÂ« districts not very thoroughly
covered in recruiting for ttv first ten
regiments will be visited by the offi
cers recruiting for these regiments. It
is the intention of th* department to
have the regiments give more attention
to firing than to any other feature of
thp drill. The men will be armed, as
are the regular infantry regiments,
â with th<> magazine army rifle.
TYip selection of thp majors and com
pany officers for the regiments is now
occupying the attention of the Secre
tary! and the men are being chosen
from among the volunteers who were
called out in the Planish war. Ttv
officers will be distributed as equitably
; as possible among the*different States,
but the efficiency record of the men will
; govern to a great extent in their se
lection. ,
ThÂ» regiments will be numbered from
thirty-eight to forty-seven, and will be
' organized at the following places j n the
order nam<=d: Fort SnelUng and Fort
Crook, Nehr.: Fort Riley, Kans. ; two
at ('amp Meade, Pa.: Fort Niagara, N.
V â¢ Fort Ethan All^n. Vt.: Fort I<eav
enworth, Kans.: Jefferson Barracks,
Mo., and South Framingham. Mass.
As will be seen by to-day's order, the
; regiments are to b*> recruited in the
New England and the Western States.
Kansas and Pennsylvania have been
selected as the best field for recruits.
It is paid that no special effort is to be \
made to secure recruits in the Southern i
States. This is due. it is said, to the
experience of the officers who operated
in that quarter for recruits for the tÂ»n
volunteer regiments just organized. The
only places where difficulty was expe- |
rlenced in securing men was in Geor- j
(Cia, Alabama and the Carollnas and |
the Gulf States and the two Northwest
ern Pacific States.
To-day's action will add 13.090 men
to the enlisted strength of the army
and increase the total strength of th>^
army to 95.035 men. The total number
of volunteers called into service is 30.170
men. b<Mng only 4530 men short of the
total authorized volunteer eatablish-
I ment of 35.000. It is stated at the de
! partnvnt that the number of volun
! teers already called into service is re
garded as amply sufficient to meet all
possible needs of the army, and that
: th<*r<Â» If no possibility that the remain
ing 4592 volunteers will be called for.
Yesterday recruiting for the volunteer |
; army amounted to 289 men. making the i
! total recruitment to date 14,122. or 1032
in excess of the number required to

under the order of July 5. All of these
regiments have secured their full quota
except the regiment at Fort McPher
son. Ca., the Thirty-third at Fort Sam
Houston. Texas, and the Thirty-fifth
Regiment at Vancouver Barracks.
These three regiments will be filled by
the use of the overflow from the more
successful regiments. The remainder of
the excess will be used in filling the
volunteer regiments being slowly or
ganized in the Philippines, which are
about ISOO m*Â»n short.

DAIRYMAN SUED FOR
BREACH OF PROMISE
! Mary Silva Plaintiff and Joseph Cos
tello Defendant in a San
Rafael Case.
SAN RAFAEL. Aug. 17.â Mary Silva, a
pretty girl, wpII known in local Portu
fcin'^- circles, has filed a breach of prom
ise suit in the Superior Court, through
Attorney J. W. Cochrane, against Joseph

sum of $10,000 and the costs of suit.
It is alleged in the complaint that Cos
tello asked Miss Silva'fl hand in marriage
on October 15, 'IS9B, and that she accepted
his proposal. As time wore on and the
defendant showed no desire to marry ho
was reminded of his promise and "kopt
advising delay, until at last he definitely
refused to marry the plaintiff. She claims
' that because of his promise of marriage
I she has since remained single and has
suffered great mental anguish on account
of his refusal to fulfill his promise. Cos
tello is a member of the dairy firm of
Brazil & Co. and is reported to be a
wealthy man.
Attorney M. F. Cochrane says it will be
proved Miss Sllva was betrayed under
promise of marriage- and that Costello is
the father of her child.

A QUESTION OF LAW
General Brooke Applies to the War
Department for Instructions
Regarding Prisoners.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, WELL
INGTON HOTEL, WASHINGTON,
Aug. 17. â Major General Brooke has
sent to the War Department a report
of the arrest near Santiago de Cuba
yesterday of General Jose Guerrero and
twenty-nine others charged with or
ganizing a filibustering expedition to
go to Santo Domingo. No instructions
have yet been sent to him regarding
the disposition to be made of the men
who have been arrested and there is
some uncertainty among officials as to
just how far the neutrality laws of the
United States can be applied to the
offenses committed in Cuba,
It seems very certain that the text
of the American law has no force in
that island so long as it is held as at
present, in trust for the Cubans, but
under the well established principles
of international Law this Government
could be held responsible for the acts
of any hostile expedition organized in
<"Ã¼ba or making that island the base
of its operations. Such government as
the United States exercises in the isl
and is a military government in which
the will of commander in chief is su
preme law, and General Brooke will
probably find some way of dealing with
the situation.
General Abelardo Mascasco of New
York, formerly Governor of one of the
provinces of San Domingo and a friend
of Jimtnez, the revolutionary leader,
called at the War Department to-day
and denied that anything was being
done in this country at present in aid
of the revolution.

BOOMING VAN WYCK AS
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE
Joseph J. Willett Opens Headquarters in
New York and Will Engineer the
Campaign.
NEW YORK, Aug. 17.â Augustus
Van Wyck's Presidential boom is in
New York watched and nurtured by j
Joseph J. Willett of Alabama and a
cordon of Southerners and commercial !
travelers. It is housed in the Hoffman j
House, where Mr. Willett has engaged |
for it a suite of rooms. Mr. Van Wyck j
did not see it yesterday, but Mr. Wil
lett showed it to hundreds of callers
and -went at night to the Van Wyck
borne In Brooklyn, where he told how
it had spent the day.
Mr. Willett came from his home in j
Anniston, arriving about 1 o'clock in j
the afternoon. He asked for mail and j
two boys carried to his room the hun
dreds of letters and telegrams that '<
! awaited him.
William F. Harrlty of Pennsylvania,
formerly chairman of the national
commltee, called on him and after the j
two had had conference and Mr. Har- i
j rity had gone rto Saratoga, Mr. Willett
dictated this statement:
"Colonel Bryan, I understand, has \
been negotiating with Richard Croker i
since early last May. Oliver H. P. Bel- !
mont first conducted these negotiations j
as only a Bryan diplomatist could. If
Tammany is satisfied with Mr. Croker
declaring for Bryan, then next to Mr.
Croker Mr. Belmont is entitled to be I
considered the greatest man in Tarn- j
many Hall and deserves second place
on the ticket should Mr. Crocker and
Mr. Bryan dominate the next national !
i convention. These intrigues began j
| early last May. I was here about that
time and met one of Mr. Bryan's most j
trusted friends at the Waldorf one !
night and had a little side conversation j
with him. He told me, not in confl- I
dence, however, that Mr. Bryan had
written a letter to him for the purpose !
of having it shown to Mr. Belraont. In j
this letter Mr. Bryan stated what he j
i was willing to dp and that practically j
' is what he has just done in his lowa j
speech â that is to subordinate the sil- j
j ver issue. In return for this he expect- j
' ed the support of Mr. Croker and that |
Mr. Croker would alter his views on
the question of expansion to conform I
with those of Mr. Bryan. Information
in this letter was to be sent by Mr. Bel
mont to Mr. Croker, who had just sail
ed for England.
"At the same time the committee of
one hundred of the dollar dinner,
through Mr. Quinby. Mr. Bryan's offl
cial representative in this city, was, I \
am informed, to have made a com- i
; bination with John C. Sheehan.
It was at this time that Mr. ;
Sheehan declared war Â«Â»upon Mr. I
Croker. But he did not know that,
fine Italian hand of Mr. Belmont was !
at work. Belmont prevented the com- <
mittee of one hundred adding Mr.
WERE SHIRKING
THE LIQUOR TAX
Officers of a Missouri
Distillery Arrested.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
ST. T.OT'IS, Aug. 17.â George M. Starck,
president of the Stonehill Wine Company
of Hermann, Mo., the largest wlnemaking
concern east of California, and one of the
most ii.fluential and respected citizens of
the State, was brought to this city to-day
by United States Marshal Bohle, who had
arrested him on the charge of defrauding
th<Â» <;overtiment by making and dispos
ing of brandy on which the revenue tax
had not been paid.
The arrest was made at Hermann at mid
night and the immense distillery, wine
cellars and plant, valued at $250,000, were
seized by a deputy of the United Statea
Internal Revenue Department. It is not
yet known by the Government officials
how mi.eh was realized by the alleged
sale of brandy on which the tax was not
paid.
Mr. Starck said: "I know absolutely
nothing of the rectifier which has caused
all the trouble. We have been rectifying
but three years, and my son attended to
that end of the business altogether. I had
no idea there was any trouble until I
learned the first of the month that the
revenue officers were here looking over
our books and plants. I did not pay much
attention to it then."
He denied emphatically that he had
been a party to any attempt to defraud
the Government, or that he knew of any
such attempt.
O. G. Starck, secretary of the wine com
pany, was arrested to-day on the same
charge preferred against his father. He
had preceded his father to St. Louis,
having come here on business connected
with the distilllery. At 1:30 a. m., both
prisoners were taken before the United
States Commissioner for examination.
Commissioner Gray at the conclusion of
the preliminary examination, held each in
bonds of $ooou to the Federal Grand Jury.
This bail was furnished and the prisoners
were released.
The warrant under which they were
arraigned charges President Starck and
his son with "Knowingly, willfully and
feloniously rectifying distilled spirits,
not tax paid, without giving notice there
of; removing distilled spirits, not tax
paid; distilling spirits without paying
the tax thereon, and failing to cancel
stamps and marks on packages of dis
tilled spirits/;
SHALL THE CLERGY
PAY DOCTOR'S BILLS?
SAN JOSE. Aug. 17.â The Santa Clara
County Medical Society is seriously
considering the advisability of charging
the clergy full rates for medical services
for themselves and their families. The
prevailing custom now is to give minis
ters and their families a liberal reduction
on doctor bills, generally about 25 per
cent. The question was fully discussed
at a meeting of the doctors last night and
had any of the reverend gentlemen been
present their ears would tingle for months
to come.
The topic, "Is it dignified or just for
the medk-al profession to furnish gratui
tous services to the clergymen and their
families?" brought up the question. All
those present were opposed and some
spoke in vigorous terms. It was claimed
the system was wrong. It was customary
to charge laborers, many of whom re
ceived less than $2 a day, while ministers,
who, in most instances, made as much
as the average physician, got reductions.
It was declared there were many doctors
anxious to serve ministers in order to ad
vertise themselves, especially if the fa
vored pastor were popular.
In all probability the question will be
brought up again and some definite ac
tion taken. In this case there promises
to be a breach between the ministers and
doctors that may be aired from the va
rious pulpits.
Killed by a Fall.

aged 65 years, fell from a load of straw

Sheehan to their forces and postponed
any action until Mr. Croker could be
heard from. This influence of Shee
han's, as well as that of Charles W.
Dayton, had been solicited to Join the !
Bryan forces with Norman E. Mack of
Buffalo, general manager of the move
ment in the State. Opposition was to
have been made when the Democratic
Committee met in St. Louis at the time
of the anti-trust dinner on May 20.
"Just before that word was received
by Mr. Belmont from Mr. Croker, so I
am informed, and conveyed to Mr.
Bryan, that the Tammany chieftain
was willing to accept Mr. Bryan's
principles and that he would declare
himself on his return from Europe. In
the meantime, through Norman E.
Mack and Mr. Belmont. Mr. Bryan was !
to cut loose all connections with Shee- j
han.
"Thinking that everything was ar
ranged, former Governor Stone of Mis
souri visited this city and solicited
Judge Augustus Van Wyck to attend
the anti-trust dinner, which he declined
to do.
"When I came into possession of these
facts several warm admirers of Judge
Van Wyck met in the Lawyers' Club
of this city and decided that if this
condition proved to be true we were I
to declare ourselves in favor of the
gr^at New York Democrat who is be
loved all over the South.
"There was already strong feeling
throughout the South against Mr.
Bryan because it was reported and be
lieved by many that he had refused
to vote for the late Speaker Crisp in j
the Democratic caucus on the ground
that the Georgia statesman had been
a Confederate officer.
"Judge Van Wyck. In my opinion, will
receive the solid support of at least five
Southern States in the next national
convention. The Southern people will
not support any man who has already
dropped the silver issue and is now
intriguing with Richard Croker to de
liver a blow at Augustus Van Wyck.
who is one of the most popular men in
the South, and who is looked upon as a
Southern man.
"There is the 'Big Four' now in na
tional politicsâ Bryan, Croker. Altgeld
and Belmont. It was the fear of Au
gustus A"an Wyck that forced Bryan to
negotiate with Croker early in May.
Commercial travelers began circulating
Van Wyck's anti-trust speech all over
the country, and they are continuing j
to do so. Commercial travelers seem !
to have adopted Van Wyck as their
favorite.
"Several of the leading commercial
travelers all over the South have al
ready called on me and assured me of
the deep interest the commercial trav
elers had in the cause of Van Wyck.
and a great many of the Bryan leaders
in the South candidly admit in private
that there is no earthly chance of his
election if he is nominated."
FIERCE FOREST FIRES

TWO YEARS' VAIN TOIL ON
GOLOVIN BAY.
Chicago Argonauts Return From the
North Poorer but Wiser Thau
When They Sailed From
Seattle.
Special Dispatch to The Call. r
SEATTLE, Aug. 17.â H. R. Rosecaulp
of Chicago, who was a member of the
Dusty Diamond party of Chicago, has re
turned from Alaska with an interesting
story concerning the fortunes of that
party. The party was composed of fifty
men. members of the Chicago Fire De
partment and manufacturers of that city.
They sailed from Seattle in May, 1597,
intending to go to Dawson City. Through
ill-luck they reached St. Michael late, and
were detained there until it became too
late to make the up-river trip. Then they
headed for the Fish River country, in the
Golovln Bay district, from which good re
ports were coming. There they have re
main* d ever since.
Their expedition outfit cost an even $50,
--000, $1000 having been put Into the proposi
tion by each member of the party. After
sixteen months of hardships and priva
tions they hnve been enabled to draw out
$400 to the man. The party is now broken
up and dispersed. Thirty-nine of the men
worked steadily through June and July
last, -sluicing on some claims owned by
the party on Ophir Creek, a small tribu
tary to the Nfukluk. in the Golovin Bay
country. For this two months' work they
got only J4oou. which was divided pro rata
among the fifty men.
Bediock they Vfound from eighteen
inches to four feet below the surface.
There was an immense amount of water
in the creek, and a great deal of damming
had to be done in order to make it possible
to Kluice at all. Through the long winter
months the party worked laboriously,
whipsawlng lumber and preparing it for
the sluicing season. The winter was
passed without great hardship, owing to
the abundance of fuel and the large
amount of supplies on hand.
Finally, coming to the conclusion that
the Dusty Diamond expedition was not to
be a success, the members decided to
liquidate and wind up the affairs of the
company. They sold their steamer, which
cost them $$000. for $1500 to the Alaska
Exploration Company. They sold a lot
of their goods, and during the open season
made some money with the steamer.
Twelve of the party returned to Seattle
by the Alliance. Captain Sieger, who
headed the expedition and was once a
captain in the Chicago Fire Department,
left the country some time ago with a
number of others.
ADRIFT FOR SIXTY HOURS
SEATTLE, Augr. 17.â Jacob Huneker of
Mansfield. Ohio, who arrived here last
night from St. Michael. Alaska, had a ter
rible experience on Hoodura Inlet, Kotze
bue Sound. He was shipwrecked, and for
sixty hours was adrift in a water-logged
boat without any assistance whatever and
without a bite to eat.
Hunekf-r and two passengerte sailed for
the Kotzebue country over a year ago.
About the middle of July a party of six
teen men left the Episcopal mission, near
Point Hope, and coasted along the shore,
| heading for the Kowak River country.
After being out a short time a storm
came up. and fifteen of the boatsâ those
with the pails upâ were quickly blown
ashore. Huneker's boat, being without
pails, made slow passage, and the fury of
the storm soon became sucn that he found
himself unable to get to shore. In spite
of his best efforts he soon was drifting:
helplessly about in the inlet.
The second morning his boat capsized.
He succeeded in righting it. and for sev
oral hours Huneker remained on his knees
in the stern nf the boat, with only his head
above water. When the storm ahated
i Huneker reached shore. He was found a
I few hours later asleep by passing pros
pectors, who by careful nursing restored
him to health.

Plan Adopted by the League of
American Wheelmen.
' BOSTON. Aug. 17.â The visiting League
of American Wheelmen' spent another
enjoyable day with tours In and out
of the city, racing at Charles River
Park and a grand smoker this evening in
Mechanics' Hall that attracted a tremen
dous crowd and was greatly appreciated.
Over 4000 of the members have registered
at headquarters and a large number of
the visitors have renewed their member
ship or joined the league. ..
The racing, of course, was the special
event of the day. but the address of Presi
dent Keenan to the local consuls in the
morning whs certainly one of the prin
cipal features, and his announcement that
Tom.Linton. who made a new hour record
this week, had come back to the League
of American Wheelmen from the National

PUGILIST JAMES FRANEY
WAS PUMMELED TO DEATH
Died at the Receiving
Hospital
AUTOPSY PERFORMED
Fall to the Ring F.'oor Was Not
Fatal.
' Vital Organs of the Figh^r Were
Diseased and He Should Not
Have Entered the Contest.
Dr. J. 1,. Zabala. autopsy physician,
made this statement last night:
"I found severe contusions on Fra
ney's face, shoulders and upper arms.
There was a hemorrhage of the brain
| on the left side, and the organ itself
i was in an anaemic condition. The
i man must have received a terrible
punishment, and death was nothing
more than the result of the blows
which rained on his face and head.
The impact of the head- on the floor
had nothing to do with it. He was
in a dying condition before he fell.
"Franey should never have en
tered the ring. An examination of
| his lungs showed plsuratic adhe
! sions and his system was otherwise
'â  broken down. He was fit for practi
cal purposes in life, but certainly not
for unnatural exercise.*'
Jim Franey, the welter-weight pugilist,
who was laid low by Frank McConnelJ
in a terrific fistic battle before the Na
tional Club at Woodward's Pavilion last
Wednesday night, expired yesterday af
ternoon at the Receiving Hospital. An
autopsy held last evening on the body of
the unfortunate prize-tighter showed that
his vital organs were diseased; that he
was in no condition to enter any ring and
principally that, he had been pummrled
and beaten to death by .MeConnell. J. J.
Groom and J. D. <;ibt>s. the promoters of
the event, and McConnell were charged
with manslaughter, but are now out on
bail.
From the time of the delivery of the
knock-out blow Franey did not regain
consciousness. On his cot in the Receiv-
Ing Hospital he lay In lethargic forgetful -
ness, breathing stertorously and mani
festing all the symptoms of brain con
cussion. Until Dr. Zabala performed the
autopsy there arose a crave question as
to whether the death-dealing blow was
the fierce right-hand swing on the. vul
nerable point of the chin or whether the
extinction of life was due. to the Impact
of the head with the floor o/ the ring. The
physicians who attended Franey in his
last hours would not venture an opinion,
declaring that either the blow or the fall
might have produced the contusion which
resulted in death. But it was all settled
last night. â¢ â¢ . â¢-
Dr. LuÃtlg. the physician of the National
Club, saiu yesterday:
"Franey received two severe cranial
shocks, either of which, may have been
the cause of his death. Symptoms of
contusion, compression . and concussion,
were present soon after the fall in which
Franey struck his head. The jarring of
the brain by a powerful blow often pro
duces a concussion which proves fatal."
There was a batch of pugilists locked
in the City Prison tanks yesterday and
visitors kept coming and going all day
long. McConnell, "Tim McGrath, J. F.
country held a meptinp to-day and dis
cussed the establishment of a consul In
each city arid ti>wn for the purpose of
promoting good roads, marking Btreets
and plnclng proper signals in had or dan
gerous localities. The proposition was re
ceived with much favor and sups wen
taken looking to tho establishment of con
sulates for the purposes Indicated.
The racing pn.Kranimc was continued
this afternoon at Charles River Park un
der well-niK'ti perfect conditions, but with
only a fair-sized crowd in attendance.

HANBBNâ In thin city. August 15, 1599. Hans
AdOlph, dearly beloved husband of Sophia

HANSENâ Ia this city. August 16. 1R99, Sophia,
dearly beloved wife of the late Hans Adolph
Hanaen, a native of Germany, aged 36 years.
Lying in caskets in a local undertaker's!
parlor are the mortal remains of Hans
Adolph Hansen and his beloved wife, So
phia. The story of their deaths is one of 1
the strangest in the annals of this
city. It is the sad history of sickness,
suicide and peaceful death of two beings
who loved each other and could not bear
to be parted.
A few days ago The Call published the
information that Hansen had shot him
self in the head because he had been in
formed that his wife, who was then in the
hospital would not recover from her ill
ness. As was .stated at the time, the sim
ple-hearted German's affection for his
wife was too great for him to live without
her, and rather than be parted from ncr
he sought death.
\s was predicted by the physician in
attendance, Mrs. Hansen passed away a
day later without having recovered con-
BciousneÃS. The news of her husband's
dramatic death was unknown to her, and
she died believing he would mourn her
loss. Both bodies will be interred on Sun
day. ,_ _
The husband was 4b years old and a na
tive of Germany. He was employed at the
Western Sugar Refinery. Fifteen years
ago he was united to his wife, and they
have lived happily. The wife was eleven
years younger and was also a native of
Germany. She was taken sick a few weeks
ago and was removed to the French Hos
pital.
BRAVE YOUNG WOMAN
PUTS MEN TO SHAME
SAUBALITO, Aug. 17.â Miss GenevievG
King, a San Francisco society girl, who
has been spending the summer season
here with friends, was the heroine of an
exciting episode which occurred just as
the ferry-boat San Rafael was drawing
into the slip last evening on the 6 o'clock
trip from the metropolis. Not only <ii.l
tho fearless girl put an end to the brutal
torture of a dog by its inhuman master
but by her action' she shamed a large
crowd at men. all of whom appeared to be
too cowardly to do more : than protest
against the shocking exhibition.
Borne man whose- name could not !>Â«-â 
learned brought a bulldog on board tin:
boat, and near the Sausalito slip the an!
mal got into a fight with another dog ami
had to be choked to make it release its
grip on the other (Tog's throat. Enriged
over the fight the bulldog's owner grasped
it by the hind legs and began to hammer
tho deck of the steamer with its head. At
the first blow blood spurted from th* tul!
flog'a nostrils. Men ran to the scene and
began to protest, but all seemed afraid
to use physical force to prevent the cru
elty to the animal.
Miss King stood with a companion upon
the upper deck and for a few seconds wai
a horrified witness of the scene. Ferceiv
ing that nobody else would interfere t l '^
girl rushed down the stairway and elbow
ing her way through the crowd grasped
the man by the arm.
"You inhuman brute!" she exclaimed,
"if you don't stop such cruel treatment
of that poor animal 1 will have you ar
rested."
Thn brutality ceased and the owner nf
the flog slunk off the boat, .followed by
the bulldog, which was hardly able to
walk. A faint cheer from the auditors
again excited Miss King's wrath, and she
gave the men present a tongue laehlnÂ« for
having left the work of interference to 1
woman. A more crestfallen crowd of men
it would have been hard to find. .
EULA MAC FIRST
IK THE FUTURITY
AT SANTA ROSA
Wins Handily From

EACH HEAT A PROCESSION
CLIPPER TAKES THE PACE IN
FAST TIME.
Clay S Is Returned Winner in the
2:14 Trot After Losing the First
Mile to the Speedy Iran
Alto. â¢ X
Special Dispatch to The Tall.
â  SANTA ROSA, Aug. 17.â A great : day's
I sport was put up at Pierce Bros." track
, I here this afternoon. Ever since the meet
| ing began it has been a case of horserac
j ing from start to finish, and to-day was
! I no exception to the rule. The day was tine
, | and the track fast, and spectators were
'\ present from everywhere.
The first race was the Pacific Breeders'
' ' Futurity, mile and repeat, trotting, for a
purse of $750. There were five entries: J.
B. Iversen's Dagmar, D. E. Knight's Eula
Mac, E. P. Heald'fl Tom Smith, G. Y. Bal
! lingers Boodle Boy and the Vendome
Farm's brown colt Vendome. After.scor
ing several times for the word the young
: sters got off in good shape. Hogoboom
. was up. behind Eula Mac, and he sent her
I through in good shape, "winning the first
i heat in 2:28 and the second in 2:25&. . The
J horses came in the same order both times,
i Vendome following Eula Mac. and Boodle
: Boy, Dagmar and Tom Smith making up
- the procession in the order named.
The 2:25 pace, best three in five,. for a
I purse of 11000, was the next called. The
fact that Roblet, the fine bay mare be
: longing to W. H. Lumsden of this city,
was among the entries, made the race of
, especial interest to Santa Rosans present.
The start was bad. however, and at the
quarter the mare was pulled off her feet.
She ran like a deer, but in getting down
I to business lost heavily, and with Gaff
Topsail and Captain Hackett was shut out
! in the first heat. H. W. Weeks' gelding
: Clipper scored in. 2:09%.
In the second heat Clipper took the lead
I and held it all the way around, finishing
lin 2:13. The third heat went to Daeda
lion in 2:11, but the fourth trial showed
Clipper again to the front, he winning as
1 prettily contested a race as one would
care to see.
The last race was the 2:14 class trot,
mile heats, two in three. There were five
entries. H. S. Schlosser's big bay stallion
Clay S carried off the honors, taking the
second and third heats in 2:14 and 2:13%.

EARLY CONVENTIONS
Democrats to Meet Next TuesdayâRepub
licans One Day Later.
Spirited Session of the Republican County Com
mittee- Tilt Between Ruef and Riordan.
Regulars Resolve to Loyally Sup
port the Ticket,
BOTH political parties declared
last night in favor of an early
convention. The Republican local
convention will meet at Odd Fellows'
Hall Wednesday evening. August 23.
Delegates to the Democratic conven
tion will assemble one day earlier at
Native Sons' Hall.
The Republican County Committee met
last evening at Pythian Castle. When A.
3. Raisch called the meeting to order
nearly all the members were present.
"Word had been passed around that there
would be a tilt between T. P. EUordan and
A. Ruef. The combat began early and
lusted until the patience of the audience
was exhausted.
After the transaction of routine busi
ness Mr. Rlordan Introduced the follow
ing:
Whereas, at a primary election held on the
fth day or August. IW. pusuant to a call [B
sued by the Kepubilcin County Committee, for
a convention 01 delegates to rerres-ent the Re
publican party ot the city ana county of
Francisco in a Republican local convention.
tertain delegates Â«we elected for the formation
of fuch convention; now therefore be It
Resolved. That the dr-!e B :Ues elected at such
primary election, pursuant to the call, for ttK
purposes nerelnbclore stated, men at the city
ana county of Stui'franciaco, t^tate of Califor
nia on the L'3d day of August. 18Â»9, at the hour
Â«-f s o'clock p. m.. In the oid Fellows' Hall, on
Seventh street, near Market. it- : :
Resolved further. Inat a notice of the time
and i'lac; ot meeting herein set forth, to
gether with a copy of ttii? resolution, he mailed
\u each person appearing to have been elected
;t? such delegate to his place of residence by
the secretary of this committee. He It turther
Kewlved, That for the purpose <v temporary
organization tne secretary of this committee
f-hall prepare and is hereby Instructed to pre
pare a roll of the del. gates who have been
ti.-cted at such primary election, which roll
snail be prepared from certificates of election
presented to him for that purpu?e, and that he
fhall have and produce such roll at the taid
u.eetine. Ue it further.
Resolved, hat the chairman of this commit
tee be dr.J is hereby authorized to call said
. meeting of the delegates to order for the trans
action of business and for the purpose of the
formation of said delegates into a Republican
local convention.
Mr. Ru. : arose immediately after the
reading of the resolution to Inquire he
purpose of ciilliiiK the convention so early.
Intimating that Lneremig.it be a concealed
scheme to dt-i'eat the ptople and embar
rass the Republican voters. V
Mr. Riordan replied that the sentiment
of the people, as expressed by the news
papers and the delegates-elect, was favor
able to an early convention. He remarked
that the delegates were not bound to pro
ceed at once to nominal a ticket, but
could meet and adjourn for one month if
they so sired.
The explanation was not sufficiently
lucid for Mr. Ruef. who Lid thai he
would move to amend the resolution If
pome intelligent explanation was not given
to account tor the violation of party pre
cedent in calling a convention so early.
After ,i general exchange of insinua
tions, in which each member deplored the
mental incapacity of the other, the audi
ence agreeing with both on these points,
the discussion descended to personalities.
Ruef was charged with deserting th._- Re
jiubJioan party in 1596 and Rlordan was
accused <it uesertlng the Democratic party
at an earlier date. Ruef. arising to a
qufstion of privilege, sought to explain .
that he went against the decree of the !
State Central- Committee in lifts on prin
ciple and supported Laumeister for Mayor
on principle.
Riordan, rising to a question of privi
lege, remarked mat he left the Democratic
party in IS7B, when Ruef was in swaddling
clothes, and had "stood by the legitimate
Republican organization ever since.
Ruef's amendment to designate Sep
tember IS as the date for delegates to as
semble in convention was rejected. Less t
than a half dozen members supported the
amendment. The resolution as presented
by Riordan was adopted by an almost
unanimous vote.
After the adoption Secretary P. H.
lergast, in answer to Ruefs inquiry
as to the meaning of the resolution, said:
'â The object of the resolution is that it
FPfms' to be the consensus of opinion
among the delegates elected at the Into
primary election that an early day would
â â¢â  the proper thing for holding the con
vention, for the simple reason that wo
are working under a different law from
any prevailing' previous to any other con
vention, owing to the fact that the party
organization is changed upon the conven
ing of the conventionâ not on the conven
ing of the convention hut is changed- by
tho convention upon the election of a new
County Committee. The said committee
shall take Immediate charge of the com
ing campaign, and in order to do bo intel
ligently It is necessary for the good of the
candidates and the ticket at large that
the complexion of the ticket should be
known."
Mr. Ruef remarked that if the explana
tion had been given early he would not
have opposed the plan.
A. J. Raiseh, chairman of the commit
tee, introduced the following resolutions,
which were adopted unanimously:
Whereas, The approaching local election for
City- and county officers under the new char
ter -in of vital interest to the Republican party
rf Pan Francisco <md to the Republicans of the
whole State, and whereas, it is pre-eminently
Important that the party should be united and
harmonious.
Resolved. That we call upon all Republicans
who have the good of the party at heart to put
HFide personal and factional differences and
dissensions to the end that the party may b<?
united against our Democratic opponents at
the coming election.

News was brought In during the meeting
that the Central Committee had an

resulted. The action of the Central Com

It will probably take i>luee at Native

THE SAN FKANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, AUGUST 18, 1899.
CROWDS GREET
THE RETURNING
COLORADO MEN
Given an Ovation by
the City.
ESTABLISHED IN QUARTERS
DEPARTTTRE OF THE BRAVE
UTAH ARTILLERYMEN.
Colonel F. H. Harbaugh Promoted
and Assigned to the First In
fantry, Colonel Miles'
Old Command.
The transport Warren docked early yes-
terday morning, but it was not until 1
o'clock that the Colorado regiment went
on its way to the Presidio.
There were crowds waiting for it along
the front; there were more crowds along
Market street and Van Ness avenue, and
there were more out at the Presidio wait
ing round among the tents to see the
boys come in and settle themselves in
quarters. There were many Hags and
cheers, more shouting and enthusiasm,
more handshakes and embraces. It was
all impromptu; too, for no one knew *hen
the regiment would move, and it was only
after the signal gun barked from the
Claus Bpreckela building announcing the
start of the column that the people began
to gather.
Every company as it passed was given
an ovation and men and officers were kept
busy returning salutes from the crowds.
It was so all down the line until the col
ors came by, and then the full significance
of It all struck the people and the tribute
of absolute silence was accorded the tat
tered ensigns. There is but little left of
the regimental flag, and what there is of
it has turned from a blue to almost a
black. There is still less' of the national
ensign. It la torn and frayed, and a stripe,
or two and the fringe is all that is left
of the body of it. The field is still un
touched, however. There is not a star in
jured, and the blue of their setting stems
to have withstood rain and wind and lead.
Torn as is the rest of it, the Coloradans
have brought back the heart of their Mag
as strong and whole as when they bore It
away; they have paid for It in blood and
suffering, "but there is not one of them
that looks at the untarnished union and
the torn stripes around it but feels the
sacrifice was worth while.
The march was the usual route of the
volunteersâ up Market street to Golden
Gate avenue, then to Van Ness avenue, to
Lombard street and to the reservation.
They were assigned to the old Oregon
camp The men stood the march well
and arrived at the Presidio about 3
o'clock and at once preparations were
begun to make the regiment comfortable
for the night. Bed ticks were issued to
the men and they were sent to a big pile
of straw at the foot of the company
streets to (ill them. Pillows were alr>p
Issued and by the time the boys had (Uicd
their ticks and had arranged them in the
tents the baggage wagons with the
blankets began to arrive.
Commissary stores had been sent down
to the company kitchens and all the cooks
had to do was to start the fires, but they
were relieved from any immediate neces
sity for this by the Pennsylvania men,
who sent an invitation for every one from
Colorado to come over and take supper.
It has been the custom so far for every
newcomer to be invited to take Its first
meal with the last arrival to the camp, so
the Pennsylvania men carried out the
rule to the letter. . The officers of the
Colorado regiment dined with the Penn
sylvania officers, and the men dined to
gether, company by company. All the
Colorado men have drawn warm clothing
in preparation for the climate here, and
the sick list of the regiment will not be
a large one.
The following men. nil convalescents,
were sent at once to the general hospital:
Corporal Malvern Tate. Frank A. W. Hrark
ley. Corporal Roy' McCandless. Musician Albert
JU-atherington, Company A; John W. Chapman,
William 11. Simpson, Joseph Goble, George A.
Hawkins, Company B; Herbert V. Aldrldge,
Company D; James J. Telfer, John Mountain,
Company V: Corporal Frank M. Dickey, An

I,- Anton J. Birth. Company M; George W.
Smith and Nicholas Polly, discharged soldiers
who came over with the Colorado men, were
also sent to the hospital. â â :"â¢â â ;
In the midst of the general rejoicing
over the return of the Colorado boys Gov
ernor Thomas finds one outside cause for
additional satisfaction. The Colorado
i boys are the last to come to camp, and to
them, therefore, remains the pleasure of
escorting the California boys to the Pre
sidio and inviting them to dine on the day
of their arrival. The Colorado men and
the Californlans have been friends from
the beginning of the war. They have
been In the trenches together, they have
cheered each other on many an occasion
and they are neighbors anyway, and the
Governor crowns his satisfaction with the
thought that his men will of right be the
ones to welcome' the California boys to
their own home.
The Utah men met at the ferry at half
past 2 o'clock yesterday afternoon, and
amid great enthusiasm boarded the boat
that was to take them to the special train
awaiting them in the Oakland mole. Many
of them had already secured citizens'
clothes. They will be given a royal wel
i come "at Ogden and at Salt Lake, where
i they will be disbanded after turning their
colors over to the State and receiving
their medals. W'-,

It was stationed at Havana, has been ap

STAFF APPOINTMENTS
BY GOVERNOR GAGE
Paris Exposition Commission Wrapped in a
Blaze of Military Glory.
W, W. Foote, E. W, Runyon, B. C, Truman and
Secretary Varney Gaskill Are Full- Fledged
Colonelsâ Story of the Sudden
Promotion.
CALIFORNIANS who have a
fondness for gazing on military
chieftains arrayed in gorgeous
splendor may now prepare to
gaze. Governor Gage has appointed
the bulk of his staff. Bulk is not the
prettiest word imaginable when applied
|to a staff, but as Adjutant General
| Seamans typifies beauty the others

may signify the bulk.
There is a little story connected with
the unexpected appointment of so
many staff officers. Yesterday Gov
ernor Gage, the Paris Exposition Com
missioners, th>- secretary of the com
mlssiun and others were speaking at
lunch of Paris and Parisians. One
member of the party; who served dur
ing the last pension of the Legislature
on the staff of Kurns, spoke of a great
function which took place in Paris
j while he was there. He said that there
was no chance for a common citizen to
gain admission to the function, so he
put on his uniform as an officer of the
'staff of Governor Perkins of California,
and the management of the show, in
their haste to recognize rank, almost
pulled down .the doors to let him in.
As Governor Gag.- was listening to
the tale a bright fancy hit him. Sud
denly he exclaimed:
"A whole lot of fellows want to get
on my staff. Why wouldn't it be just
MRS. PARRY'S FAMILY DID NOT
ASK HER AWKWARD QUESTIONS
TWO women, each wearing black
for Frank Parry, wept copiously
when the coat and rest of the
murdered man were offered aa evi
dence In Judge Graham's court
yesterday. One of these* women was the
mother of tho deceased, the other the
widow and accused of the crime. The
widow was garbrd in fashionable mourn
ing and surrounded by thoughtful, tender
relatives arid friends. The mother wore
shabby, rusty black, and when she wept
there was no one near to comfort her.
The mother controlled herself better
than the widow, who in the midst of her
stepfather's testimony turned white and
In a swooning condition was carried from
the courtroom.
The only witness at yesterday's proceed
ing's was William yon Valkenberg, the
youthful stepfather of the defendant. Yon
Valkenberg told of the circumstances that
followed the shooting and Incidentally
developed the fact that he and Mrs.
Parry's family were the least curious
people on record.
When Yon Valkenberg saw his step
daughter rush down the stairs toward
him. with a smoking pistol in her hand,
he asked no questions. When he was
sent for a physician he went without
questioning. When lie went to Parry's
room and ripped off his coat he asked the
deceased no questions, and later, even
after the police had been called in, he
asked no questions. His wife, Mrs.
Parry's mother, also asked no questions
and the young wife herself never came
to the sufferer's room to inquire as to
the patient's condition or the doctor's
verdict.
Mr. yon Valkenberg testified how, on
the evening of June 12 Frank Parry and
the accused made their home with Yon
Vulkenberg and wife at 107 Guerrero
street.
'â¢After dinner on the evening of June
12," said the witness, "Mr. and Mrs. Parry |
The Centennial's Accident.
Captains Bolles and Bulger, United
States Inspectors of Local and Foreign
Steam Vessels, begaji yesterday taking
testimony in the matter of the grounding
of the Government 'transport Centennial
on a coral reef off the coast of Luzon, in
the Philippines. The investigation will
be continued to-day. Nothing new was
elicited. The accident happened while the
Centennial was on the way to Manila to
take returning soldiers on board.
the thing to make the members of the
Paris Commission and the secretary
staff officers?"
The Commissioners and the secretary
intimated that the Governor could not
make a better selection. That is the
story of sudden promotion.
Colonel "W. W. Foote, who served
valiantly in the Confederate army and
heroically resisted the advance of
Grant on Jackson, Raymond and Vicks
burg, did not then dream of gaining
higher rank than that of captain. Now,
at one great bound, he is promoted to
the full glory of colonel. All along the
line yesterday Colonel Foote was
saluted.
The rise of Runyon is even more re
markable than the promotion of Foote.
Yesterday E. W. Runyon was only a
plain banker in Red Bluff. To-day he
is a full-fledged colonel on the staff of
Henry T. Gage, Commander-in-Chief
of the military and naval forces of Cal
ifornia. Tehama County will be illum
inated to-night.
Ben C. Truman, who reported the
first but not the worst speech that Gage
ever made in California, can go to
Paris wearing the eagles of a colonel.
In his long tour of service in the liter
ary department of the Southern Pacific
Railway and as secretary of the Yo
semite Valley Commission, Truman
could never get above the grade of
major, but in this shower of military
glory, wherein rank like the dew of
heaven falls alike on tho blue and the
gray. Major Truman grows a notch.
Varney Gaskill, a veteran nf the Na
tional Guard who served with distinc
tion on the staff of Major General Di
mond at Santa Cruz, becomes a colonel
by reason of holding the office of secre
tary of the commission. Colonel Gas
kill's advancement in rank will cause a
thrill of popular pleasure from Amador
to AJameda. The colonel, apprehensive
that the Governor might revise the list
of appointments, immediately acquired
vested rights by ordering a uniform.
There remains but one thing for Gov
ernor Gas^ to do in order to complete
the military splendor of the Paris Corn
mis >ri. He should appoint the official
stenographer. Vivandiere. Of course
it is not customary to have a Vivan
diere on a Governor's staff, but Gage is
different from other Governors, and
th<' young lady Is worthy of military
promotion.
were the first people to leave th.-> table.
They went direct to their room upstairs,
and I went out Into the yard to play with
the dog. I heard a shot and rushed into
the house. At the foot of the staircase
leading to the second floor I met the de
fendant. She was coming down, in a
fainting: condition, and held a revolver
In her hand. I took the gun from her.
We exchanged no words. 'Run for a doc
tor,' she said, and I jumped on my wheel
and went. I asked no questions. She vol
unteered no information."
The witness then went on to state how
he successively went for Dr. Fitzgibbon
and Dr. Regan, and finally found Dr. Mor
rison, who followed him to the house.
"When I got back to the house," said
Yon Valkenberg. "Parry was sitting in a
chair. I took out my knife and ripped off
his coat. There was no conversation.
Miss Harrison, my wife's niece, was in the
room. I did not see Mrs. Parry, and never
Inquired for her. "
The young stepfather did not recall any
conversation at the dinner table on the
evening of June 12 relative to Leo Hirsch
man. He had known Hirschman for about
three months prior to that date, but be
lieved he called upon Miss Minnie Brown.
Mrs. Parry's sister. Witness also had no
remembrance of Dr. Bazet asking how the
shooting had occurred, nor of the doctor's
query as to how far from the muzzle the
patient was when the pistol was fired.
Yon Valkenberg also testified that the
pistol from which the fatal shot was fired
belonged to him, and that he was in the
habit of lending it to Mr. and Mrs. Parry
for pistol practice.
"About two weeks before the shoot
ing," said the witness. "I gave it to Mrs.
Parry to clean. After that I never saw it
until I took it. smoking, from her hand
on the evening of the 32th of June."
After Van Valkenberg's testimony was
concluded court adjourned until Monday
next at 2 o'clock.
The Hayden Inquest.
Owing to the non-attendance of wit
nesses, Coroner Hill has postponed the
Inquest into the matter of the death of
Edward Hayden, who committed suicide
In the City Receiving Hospital last
Wednesday night. The Coroner is anxious
to knÂ«iw how Hayden was allowed to get
the coil of wire into his cell.

COME UP WITH THE COIN
MTU IN a week the California Volunteers will
/ be home. Whatever reception we are' to ac
cord them must be prepared for in that time.
.'i committee has asked for $50,000,' that being the
amount estimated to be sufficient to make the welcome
Worthy of the heroes and of the State. Something
like $35,000 has been subscribed or raised by various
entertainment?. For the remainder of the required
Sum an appeal must be made to the citizens, and it
goes without saying the contributions should be
made before the close of this week.
. Some of the larger corporations and wealthier com
panies of the 1 city have either refused to contribute at
/all or have made contributions far below the measure
the public had a right to expect of them. Doubtless
â¢their official feel more pleasure in the gratification
of Stinginess than in any welcome, could give or
help to give to the returning volunteers, and that
being so they have acted after their kind. The great
mass of the people, however, arc of another nature,
S;m Francisco has not won her proud reputation for
â¢hospitality and generosity without deserving it. Some'
niggard and mean persons we have indeed in the
â community, but they are comparatively few. In this
vm&tance, as in former ones, we can get along with
out them and give our heroic volunteers a welcome
which. will be all the more gracious because these nig
gards will have no part in it. . â¢ .
/..â¢He is but a spirited Californian who does not
:>e! something of a thrill of joyous expectancy in the
knowledge that the California Volunteers will be
home, in so short a time. We have, given a patriotic
â¢welcome to the returning heroes of our sister States,
but our hearts have been waiting for the coming of
our own. The days will pass rapidly. In a short
time we shall hear the booming of the guns that an
nounce- the arrival of the transport at the Golden
Gate, and then the grandest festival in the history of
the city will begin.
â¢. That festival must not fall short of popular desire
in any way. Every feature of it must be brilliant.
Beautiful and triumphant. The money, required for
the completion of the great preparations now under
way ought to be in the hands of the committee before
Saturday night Upward of $35,000 has been raised.
There is needed about $15,000 more.' San Francisco
can easily raise that in two days if her people give
heed to. the need of it. Come up with the coin.
Reports from Sacramento indicate that Governor
Gage has put his foot in it in letting an unauthorized

mansion â not next term, anyhow. : â 
: The management of the Mechanics' Fair has made a
curious oversight. In the programme of sports it has
made no provision for foot-racing, in which, to judge
from the reports from Manila, the countrymen of
Agtiinaldo excel.

THE TRANSVAAL.
THE Dutch settlements in South Africa had in
them the whplesome.elemcnt and fair promise of
a real colonial plant. They were in a congenial
climate, in the south temperate zone. The Dutch
race was there stoutly perpetuated from generation *o
generation, and did not die out as in the Dutch plan
| tations- in Java and other hot islands in the Indian
j Ocean.
The Dutch settlements in temperate Africa had a
natural growth, and features exactly in common with
the growth of the English colonies in North America,
which by natural increase have overgrown a continent.
The Dutch planted liberty and religion as the founda
tion of their materialities, and there grew up genera
tions that know no other fatherland than the Boer
nations of the Dark Continent.
Every right-minded person in the world knows and
feels that the interests of humanity, the welfare 01
mankind, the preservation of the germs of liberty,
require that the Dutch of the' Transvaal be left to
work out their destiny by natural growth. They have
taken kindly to physical conditions there. Their in
stitutions arc such as to preserve their, national and
racial characteristics, and the foundation they have laid
is broad enough to hold the superstructure of a great
natipn dedicated to the principles of William the
Silent and John of Barnevcldt.
If the mission of England were to promote the
spread of civilization and the extension of those civil
institutions by which her people have profited at
home, she would gallantly salute the Transvaal Re
public and thank it for assuming so much of her bur
den, and leave it in security to work out its great des
tiny. That England does not do this, but instead is
making tons of dumdum bullets and shipping to
South Africa every terrible engine of war that can
mutilate and murder men, proves the cordial hy
pocrisy of her claim to be the patron and promoter
of civilization. It is not to the credit of the United
States that we helped England at the Peace Confer
ence steer so well through that no tribunal
was provided in which a people like those of the
Transvaal can appeal for justice to the conscience of
the nations. Ahab covets Naboth's vineyard again,
and if the United States have acted Jezebel's part in
i taking it away let this nation remember Jezebel's fate.
1 England is guilty of ingratitude to the Dutch. Under
her Stuart Kings she was practically a vassal of
. France. Her Kings accepted an annual subsidy for
the privy purse from Louis XIV. She was under
1 Gallic suzerainty from Charles I to James 11. with
exception of the short reign of the Lord Protector.
Her military energies and her- commercial progress
were subordinate to the interests of France.
From this humiliation she was delivered by the j
Dutch. The grandson of the great Stadtholder raised
her out of the gutter where she groveled at the feet
of France and made her stand upright in her rightful
' place among the nations.
It is said that one generation owes no gratitude nor j
incurs any obligation to any that has preceded it. The
| author. of that iiiuch discussed book. "The Social
Compact," carries this into the domestic relation and
applies it to parent and child, the one being under no
obligation to provide for the other. This brutal phil
osophy seems adapted to the British policy in her in
ternational affairs, and she moves, well armed and
jocund, to the slaughter of the weak, to the murder of I
liberty, to the effacement of the best civilization in !
Africa, though in ><.> doing she is a matricide in cut
ting the throat of a principle which , is the mother of
her' own liberty. . |
The patriots of the Transvaal can turn' nowhere for
help and sympathy. Their motherland, long de
bauched by the wealth that lias flowed from oppres- i
sion of. the Javanese, holding a .robber's title to the
land of others and to the bodies of men in Asia, can- I
not dispute the right of another to rob the Trans
vaal without condemning herself.
This republic, to which until now the eyes of be
leaguered freemen have turned in distress, to be
cheered by our sympathy, having indorsed the doc
trine o-f the divine right of a monarchy to buy and
sell land and people without their consent,* and being ;
in the â¢honeymoon of a conquest which pride and j
policy combined to make necessary, can make no sign !
to cheer the Boers.
They .are left alone, with their rifles, their Bibles !
and their God. May fortune send them another >

The rule of the School Board that lady teachers
marrying while in the department must resign has
been enforced in. the case of Mrs. Mary F. Bcanston. '
Why not? It seems to be a regulation based on j
equity,. and takes for granted that every teacher con
tracting matrimony has regard enough for herself to
select a man able to support her. That being the case,
she should step aside and allow some other young
lady, not so fortunate, a chance for a salary and
maybe,' ultimately, a husband with earning capacity.

THE VOICE OF THE PEOPLE.
STATESMEN and other impartial persons who
have made up their minds not to be biased
<m the issue of imperialism until they have
learned what the voters think about it may study with
some profit a poll recently made by the Farm and
. Home, Tine of the most widely circulated of our
agricultural journals. For the purpose <n obtaining
the views of its readers on the various points involved
; in the expansion policy it invited replies to a scries of
questions and received 21.000 answers.
In a summary of the poll it is. stated about 10 per
' cent of the answers came from New England, 25 per
' cent from the Middle States, nearly 40 per cent from
the Mississippi Valley, and the remainder about
equally from the South and the Pacific Coast. The
polJ of course is but a small proportion of the voters
: of the United States, but it is the most extensive yet
made, and may be considered fairly representative of
the sentiment of that part of the farming community
thai takes enough interest in public affairs to care to
express an opinion on them. ,
According to the digest of the poll from which we
I quote, the first question was. "Should the Filipinos be
held in subjection to the United States, or should
they be allowed to form an independent government?"
: The answers from each of the five sections of the
country were largely in favor of independence, the
! totals footing up 12.520 for independence to 8416 for
subjection. The majority was still greater for Cuban
independence â 13.199, as against 7362 for annexation.
I On the other hand, a large proportion favor^the an
j nexation of Porto Rico to the United States â 11.897,
j as against 6004 for its independence and 1746 for its
annexation to Cuba. Finally, not to go through the
j whole list, the expressions of opinion were most ein
j phatic on the comprehensive question, "In general,
j should the United States adhere to or depart from its
THE SAIN If KAJS CISCO CALL, 1 KID AY, AUUUST 18, lSUi*.
former policy of non-interference with nations beyond
either ocean?" There were 15,624 replies in favor ot
adherence, as against only 3887 in favor of the new
departure.
A vote of that kind is significant. Farmers do not
skim newspapers carelessly- as city people do in the
rush of many things attracting their attention from
great issues. They read the news carefully. They
study it and form fixed convictions on subjects that
interest them. The vote taken by the Farm and
Home, therefore, means the matured and well consid
ered judgment of intelligent and thoughtful men upon
a subject they have well considered. Persons who are
not in the habit of writing do not take the trouble to
answer a long list of questions for mere pastime. The
men who replied to the queries are in earnest. They
meant what they wrote and are not likely to change
their well formed opinions between now and election
day. . â 
â We may then justly regard the ballot a? an expres
sion of the farmers of the country. By a vote of
nearly five to one they declare the United States
should adhere to the old policy of non-interference
with nations beyond either ocean. Statesmen who
have their ears to the ground waiting to hear what
the people say need listen no longer. If they cannot
lesrn something from that vote they would not learn
if the ground shook from center to circumference.
The readiness with which the military witnesses in
the Dreyfus trial conjure copious tears to their eyes
and then blackguard the accused suggests that even
in hatred there is sympathy or weakness. Or perhaps
it is absinthe.
Guerin, the French agitator, says he is willing to die
for an idea. It would not be a difficult task to name
some people who certainly would expire if ever they
were attacked by the affliction that Guerin is willing
to die for.
THE OLD KENTUCKY HOME.
WHEN the lortg-winded West Indian hurricane
approached our South Atlantic coast and
heard of the Democratic campaign in Ken
tucky it may have remarked to itself. "Two of a trade
never agree," and then dived into the ocean or went
up into the welkin.
Immediately following Governor Altgeld's declara
tion of a vendetta against Goebel, the "regular Demo
cratic .nominee for Governor, and the expression of
his opinion that Colonel Bryan would not go to Ken
tucky, the colonel announced his dates for that State
and his intention to go there and employ his every
oratorical tooth and nail in behalf of the rcgulai
nominee. Colonel Watterson, with that intellectual
effrontery which is as matchless as his literary style,
proceeded to administer Colonel Bryan as a bitter pill
to the bolters. The latter recalled Colonel Watter
son's impassioned telegram sent from the Matterhorn
in 1896 demanding a bolting candidate against Bryan,
and the colonel's anti-bolting purgative was returned
to him with the sugar licked off, and Kentucky, from
Beargrass to Bkielick, began to seethe. Not since
the days of Daniel Boonc has the dark and bloody
ground turned up blacker and more gory. The local
Chautauqua summer school occupation of lynching
Mormon elders was suspended. The ll atneld- McCoy
and other feuds in the mountain counties proclaimed
an armistice, and people in that section ventured un
armed out of doors and freely visited the moon>hinc
distilleries for spiritual refreshment. In the presence
of a politicar*cyclonc all smaller storm* were forgot
ten. Even W. C. P. Breckinridge could be seen in
the neighborhood of a female seminary without tiie
shutters being put up and the dog untied. â¢ â 
How seriously it is all taken may be seen by the
warning issued by Congre.>sman Berry that Bryan is
in danger of being shot while riding skyward on the
climax of a Goebel .speech. Mrs. Bryan, faithful lady,
has expressed a fear that the colonel is liable to per
foration, and Mr. Berry has increased her solicitude
by announcing that "Kentucky people arc of quick
passions and they do not hesitate to use revolvers if
the speaker does not please them." In iXc/> they
used eggs that were too ripe for utterance in rum
omelets on Mr. Carlisle, and we believe they also per
verted the hen industry in the same way to convince
Simon Bolivar Buckncr that his style Was disliked.
That form of literary criticism is as nothing, however,
to the expression of disapproval with a gun.
To add to the interest of the situation Governor
Altgeld declares that if Bryan go to speak for Goebel
he will stump the State against him. This is only
fair. If the bolters take a pot shot at Bryan it is
proper. that the regulars should have a chance at
Altgeld, who says that Gocbel stole all of the nomi
nation that he didn't buy.
The call to arms is general, and not since the days
of John Morgan and Humphrey' Marshall has the old
Kentucky home been as sulphurous and full of
ginger.
As Congressman Berry is a great Bryan man there
is' room to suspect that the situation is created for
advertising purposes. Colonel Bryan was in the mili
tary service for a year, but did not plant a squadron
in the field n<ir get outside of cantonment. He is
by nature a Thespian, but carries no jewels, except
the pearls of speech. As he docs not lose these, he
can become an object of interest by being put under
tire on the stump. -It will round out his military
career. ,
The very threat is of great value, for it fits in with
his stage properties, useful in his business.
It has' been supposed that the Philippines were
torrid, but they are a sideshow.
The chief of all the Mormon missionaries said re
cently that Zion's troubles in the South originated in
politics. Their ciders were stripped, whipped, ridden
on splintery rails and ducked in unconsecratcd water
for political reasons. If this were so they must' be
thankful that by politics they are also delivered, and
that the prospect of getting a shot at a stump speaker
afflicted by a chronic case of Presidential candidacy
has given them a truce wherein to take up the work
of salvation.
Throughout the country orderly people will have
time to think of what would follow putting the
National Government in control of a party which en
forces correct style in stump speaking at the muzzle
of a pistol.
As far as known these arc the happiest clays Sena
tor Blackburn has seen since his term ended, No
danger that his speeches will be blue-penciled with a
Kentucky revolver. He is for BlackbuiT* and doesn't
care an imprecation who knows it. The mantle of
Clay and Crittenden is his vest pattern. Statesman
ship is his profession; he works at it as others do
at poker or craps. He is solid with the regulars and
bolters alike, and. having a leg in both camps, docs
not care who elects the Governor so he can get the
Legislature.
On the whole we commend Kentucky to Governor
Roosevelt as a place where the "strenuous life" may
be enjoyed without a declaration of war or enfeebling
the digestion with embalmed beef.
Advices pouring in to the various local campaign
committees indicate an early crop of office-seekers.
An early frost is anticipated.

A MEMORAMA
AND A MERRY
COMIC OPERA
If "Under Two Flags" was selected to
finally and triumphantly prove the versa
tility of Mlp.s Roberts the play has served
its purpose. Trained in the incumbrances
of a fan, a lace handkerchief and ar. oc
casional train she comes on as Clgftfette
weighted with a pistol, a dirk, a canteen
and cup, a mail bag, a half dozen pack
ages, a swagger and a rather questionable
vocabulary, and handles them all us
though born to the station. She keeps her
emotions trimmed down to the necessities
of the character and becomes to the life
the saucy, valiant, faithful, hotheaded
little trooper.
That we do not like to think of Miss
Roberts in melodrama is no cause for a
quarrel, and although some of us do not
like the play the houses indicate that
there are a few others who do. With
judicious cutsâ the death of Rake in the
desert, for instanceâ and given on tno
scale of "The Soudan," it may yet prove
a mine for some enterprising manager.
The locale gives tho latitude for specta
cle so potent as a drawing attraction and
the action is rapid and varied. The sand
ttonn is quite realistic. By selection of
incident and choice of dialogue Bertie
Cecil, Interesting in the book, becomes
merely a languid martyr in the position
he is, merely because he has not spirit
and character enough to get out of it. It
is well for the Berties that they have
their Cigarettes in every sense of the
word. The play is well staged and judi
ciously cast, and wildly applauded.

After the gloom and morbidness of
"Hedda < Jailer" it was refreshing to lis
ten to the merry, tuneful "Dorothy" and
be put again in a singing, swinging rhyth
mical mood by the rattling good chorus
at the end of the second act. The music In
"Dorothy" is Just simple enough and pop
ular enough to come within the Intelli
gence of all. It is one of the most enter
taining tilings the Grand Of)era-house has
j put on. The principals are good, tho
! choruses good, and of special interest as
a funmaker is Bessie Bairbarn, the Pris
cilla Prlvett. She is a regular man com
edienne In petticoats. Her solo about "A
1 Lovely Surami r Morning" starts out with
; promise and the weariness of dipappoint
i ment is never reached. There is variety
| to her humor, too. One can fancy her lo?-
Ing her identity in a dozen different way:;
at least. Georgie Cooper has one virtue
those grouped about her might copy. S'ie
Is always interested in the incidents of
the opera and the emotions created by
j this interest find expression in her face.
So many singers, especially those of the
chorus, sing with such a "happy uncon
cern of anything but the melody and with
thrir faces such beautiful blanks. "Dor
othy" will be followed next week by
"Clover." CHARLOTTE THOMPSON.

NO MORE CONTRACT WIVES-Sub
scriber, City. This correspondent aÂ«k~:
"Under the laws of California how long
does a woman have to live with a
before she can assert herself as his
wife?" California recognizes but or.
by which a woman can assert herself as
the wife of a man. and that is by mar
riage by a person duly authorized V
emnize a marriage. Contract marr: .
that is, where a man and woman
to recognize each other as man and â .

some Information concerning the where

man that the detectives were confident
that any disclosures he chose or could be
induced to make would throw a great
deal of light on the movements of the man
that swindled the Denver millionaire.
They were not mistaken.
Adams told many things which fully
confirmed the stories published In The
Call concerning ward and the men who
were concerned In the plot to do away
with Green and who robbed the steamer
Alameda.
Adams admitted that there was $20,000
in Kelly's hack at the dock the night of
March 22 last, when the Alan sailed
for Australia. He said that Howard, after
â lu/hjid made the excuse to Green that, his
arrest on the warrant served by Eddie
â Kuuflman would prevent his accompany
ing the Denver man on th( voyage, re
mained In hiding on the dock with him
self and Eddie kauffman until the steam

this was to see that Green sailed and that
with him went the thrt>e Australiansâ-
Jimmif Murphy, Jimmie Kelly and ."Jackie
Casey, who were to throw him overbear'!
at son Adams also said that he learned
some time afterward that, d< spil the

two men say they bad been employed by
< reen to throw Howard overboard.
Adams was asked by captain l. Ps if
it \v:.s not n fact that the Btory he had
'"lil the woman bad not been volunteered
by him In pursuance of Instructions from
Howard, bo that it might get to the ears
of the poli< â  .
"Yes, he replied, "1 did it on his sug
gestion."
Prom other Information gained from
Adama t he detectives are now satisfied
that there were four men Instead of three
employed by Howard to do away with
' Sri i ::. The fourth man is named Mitch
ell, ami while tiie police have heard, of
liim lime and again in their search for
t :.. â â  were led to believe here
tofore that Mitchell was merely an alias
for one of the trio. A.dams oleared up
that point to their satisfaction.
When Howard returned to. .this city
after having taken skk. apparently, at
. .... while on his way down with
Green to examine the shale lands, Adams
says he told him that this man Mitchell,
who had been employed by Green to
throw him overboard, had nearly accom
d his purpose. Howard exhibited to
Adams a i r.>K'-n nose as corroboratlon of
the story. He Bald thai be had gone out
in a hack with Mitchell one night in
Honolulu and that Mitchell bad drugged
him and attempted to throw him out of
the hack over a cliff.
The detectives take occasion to dispute
the assertion of Howard's attorneys that
he was a badly abused man and that they
are mistaking him for his "had imnher."
Idition. the officers take occasion to
point Oil! and say that the action of the
attorneys Is. very peculiar. If. they say,
Mr. Beatty's claim is true that money has
â¢ rted from Howard, why did he
he uul with Mr. Green's attorney?
JiiM after Howard paid over the. $52,000
.Mr. Beatty called upon Green's
S bj d said his client would be un
able to keep the agreement that he hid
: to pay over the balance of th-- $105 -

He replied that Howard said he could

big house out on Potrero avenue and
Twenty-fourth street was thronged with
as gay and happy a crowd as could be
gathered together.
j The house had been lavishly decorated
| with ferns and evergreens. The garden
was aglow with a hundred Chinese
lanterns strung along the walks and un
i der the trees, and on the lawn behind the
! house the supper tables had been laid
in n a pavilion built among the trees just
for the accommodation of the diners A
slender eucalyptus sprouted up through
the floor and out through the roof and its
I lower branches lent their aid to the deco
rations, that twined around the rafters
and ran along the walls.
On a table in , the dining-room the pres
ents had been placed on exhibition. There
were Fiver lollct articles and ornaments!

of silver, a silver-mounted flask, a whip
as richly silver-mounted, a silver ladle, a
silver salad service, two dozen silver tea
spoons silver forks, silver knives, silver
: salt and pepper dredges, and a score of
I other things, all of silver. In the plan'
of honor, however, was placed a sliver
bread tray, the gift of the employes of
the California Glue Works, of which Mar
tin Holje is the owner.

so tenderly held in memory. It was light
and filmy and fitted the girlish figure to
perfection; it might have looked almost
as well on her mother, however, for time

THE SAN FKANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, AUGUST 18, 1899.
AT HOME AMONG FINDS THE
END CAME TO CAPITALIST DREXLER
â 
A Life That Was Full
of Energy.
"SUCCESS" IS HIS EPITAPH
FORTUNATE IN MANY STATES
AND IN MANY CONCERNS.
Story cf a Man Who by Perseverance,
Honesty and Business Ability
Prospered in AJI That Hs
Undertook.
Lomis P. Drexler died yesterday morn
ing between the hours of 11 and 12 at his
residence, 1003 Van Ness avenue. He bad
been ill for some months past with a
bronchial affection, and though everything
that regard could prompt or science sug
p-cst had been done for him, it proved of
no avail, and the long expected end came
at last.
Mr. Drexler was one of the best known
capitalists of the State. In nearly every
direction of commercial enterprise was he
Interested, and In every line did his en
ergy, industry and honesty cause him to
thrive and prosper. He was especially
buc< essful as a miner, banker, stock raiser
and vineyardist, and the fortune that he
leaves in city real estate is the best possi
] ble attestations to the soundness of his
judgment in matters of investment. He
was a Virginian by birth, his ancestors
settling in that State long before the Rev
olution had severed it from its allegiance
|to its Knglish parent. The family was a
j distinguished one, and in all the wars of
j our country it was represented, as it was
also in the legislative councils of the na
tion.
When the deceased was yet but little
more than a boy the family moved to
Kentucky, and then to Ohio. Here young
Drexler fitted out a merchandise train and
Btarted out to seek a fortune in the great
! unknown West.
He engaged in business at Salt Lake in
1854 and was succeeding splendidly when
Brighain Young issued the famous edict
<lri\ing the Gentiles out of the country.

GRAPE GROWERS
INDORSE HENRY
CROCKER'S OFFER
Action of Chamber of
Commerce.
Henry? J. Crocker's offer to the grape
growers of California to pay them $12 and
$14 a ton for their grapes, provided they
will -sign a contract at those figures cov
i ering a period of seven years, was form
ally Indorsed by representative growers
at a meeting held in conjunction with the
San Francisco Chamber of Commerce yes
terday afternoon, at which the proposition
was discussed in all its various phases,
i The meeting- was called by the Chamber
', of Commerce at the instance of the wine
growers, Mr. Crocker being present to
explain any points in connection with his
scheme which were not quite clear to
those to whom his offer was addressed.
Captain Nelson presided, and after ex
'â¢ plaining the purpose of the meeting and
urging the necessity of doing something
to foster one of the greatest industries of
the State' Introduced Mr. Croker.
Mr Crocker briefly related his experi
! ence'as president of the California Wine
Makers' Corporation and outlined the
proposition made by him to the growers
of the State.
"Now I am here to answer questions,
â  he said,' "and if there is any grower here
1 who Is dissatisfied with the contract as
prepared by me 1 hope he will state his
objections "frankly."
II M. La Rue of I-ivermore was the first
i to accept the invitation thus extended.
Ho said many of the growers disliked the
plan of entering into a contract which
bound them to sell their grapes to Mr.
Crocker for seven years at a stated price
but did not bind him to purchase them
at that price. In other words, it left him
at liberty to draw out at any time if he
should conclude that he had made a bad
bargain. -v . > "â  .
The main objection, however, as stated
by Joseph Naphtaly, came from the
growers who' were also winemakers. They
wanted some assurance that if they en
i tered into a contract with Mr. Crocker
to sell their -crops to him he would have
the grapes made into wine at their win
eries, otherwise the investment repre
i sented in these wineries would be a dead
; loss.
Mr. ('rocker, in answer to this conten
i tion, called attention to his circular
wherein he stated that he proposed, when
! such a thing was feasible, to enter into
j contracts with the proprietors of the
wineries to crush the grapes at a fair re
muneration, and assure profit sufficient
to enable them to realize interest on their
Investment, but he could not make any
contract with a winemaker who was also
1 a grower until the. latter had first accept
; ed his proposition to buy his grapes.
D. M. Delmas and Joseph Putnam par
i ticipated in this discussion, which was
: carried to considerable length. Mr. Put
nam in particular was at first strongly op
posed to the proposition on the ground
statedâ that there appeared to be no as
surance that the winemakers who were
also growers, were sufficiently protected,
but Mr. Crocker succeeded in answering
i all objections brought forward In a satis
factory manner, even to the matter of the
one-sided contract.
Mr. La Rue tried to get him to agree
to advance 10 per cent of the contract
price as the grapes were delivered, in
stead of deferring payment until the end
of the season, as is the custom, in order
that the pdorer growers might have, the
money with which to pay the pickers, but
Mr. Crocker, replied that when the grower
delivered his grapes ,at the winery he
would receive a weight receipt which
would be worth its face value, and upon
which he would have no difficulty in bor
rowing all the money he might require at
the banks.' </':. '
A. Sbarboro indorsed this statement and
urged the acceptance of the entire prop
osition as made by Mr. Crocker, which he
characterized as extremely liberal. A let
ter to the same effect from Thomas Adler
was read, and the following resolutions,
pared by Messrs. Delmas and Naph
taly, were "then unanimously adopted as'
the sense of the meeting: : ; ;
Resolved. That we, the grape growers and
â winemakers of th* ' State here assembled, heart
ily approve the contract proposed by Henry J.
Crocker to the crape growers of the State, be
lieving that in the execution of such contract
lies the salvation of the wine industry of
California; and
Resolved, Further, that having carefully con
sidered the circular of Mr. Crocker, touching
the relations which he proposes to establish
between himself and those grape growers who
are also wlnemakers, and having listened to
the explanation made by Mr. Crocker of that
circular, we are satisfied that the Interests of
the -winemakers are fully protected thereby,
and we do hereby urge upon all wine grow
era of the State to accept and sign, said con
tract.
A resolution of thanks was also extend
ed to the Chamber of Commerce and Cap
tain Nelson for favors shown and interest
manifested In the matter. Captain Nelson
responded by expressing the hope that Mr.
Crocker would succeed in converting: all
the growers in the State to his scheme;
which he regarded as of certain benefit to
one of the great industries of California.

STRIVING TO AID
THE WORKING GIRLS
New Society Being Formed to Secure
Shorter Hours for Sales-
Women.
An earnest effort is on foot to alleviate
the Bufferings of the working girls of this
city. Mrs. John Pettefe, president of the
Vigilance Committee, an organization
which has been striving to purify China
town, and one of the hardest workers in
the cause Of humanity, is at the head of
the project. A meeting of the movers in
the scheme was held at Mrs. IVttee's home
;.t I'"."."; Leavenworth street yesterday
afternoon. Over sixty ladles were pns
ent, and numerous plans to aid the work
ing girls- were considered. The main ob
ject < i f tlii> meeting was to arrange for a
mass-meeting to be held shortly to protest
against the long hours of the saleswomen
in ttie various department stores of this
cit>.
Mrs. Pettee stated that she had the
premise of many firms that they would
close promptly at fi o'clock on Saturday
night if their rivals would do likewise.
The work of the new organization will be
mainly devoted to bringing- about this
important move, as its members deem it
essential to the health and morals of the
young women of the city.
The organization also intends exposing
the proprietors of a number of canneries
in this city who persist in hiring: little
girls t" cut fruit and compel them to work
In basements for hours at 5 and 10 cents
it day. Other reforms will be advocated
by the organization, which will In all
probability be a branch of the Vigilance
Society.
EMPLOYERS WILL
REINSTATE SOLDIERS
Thp appeal of the citizens' executive
commit too to the former employers of the
members of the California volunteers to
reinstate the soldier boys upon their re
turn lias brought pood results. The spirit
of the employers is that the men should
not suffer for their loyalty to their coun
try, and in most cases thi.-ir old situations
have been reserved for them.
The headquarters of the employment
committee at the I* nion -square tent has
received many encouraging communica
tions bearing on the matter. Sachs
Brothers & Co. had tn their employ Cor
poral William Hi.egin:-. H>- can return to
the firm's employ as soon as he is mus

â â â¦ â â
Market-Street Railway Will Use
Wood Instead of Iron Poles on
the "Corkscrew" Route
Through Town.
Attorney J. A. Foulds of the Southern
Pacific Company and Henry J. Lynch of
the Market Street Railway Company ap
peared before the Street Committee of the
Board of Supervisors yesterday to say
that the anti-turn table ordinance as pre
sented by Supervisor Byington was not
drawn in the lines of the law, and was
of a consequence not worthy the further
consideration of the Supervisors.
Mr. Foulds, who conducted the argu
ment, quoted no decisions and no law save
that set down in the recent decision of
Superior Judge Bahrs. Even in this Su
pervisor Byington contended that Mr.
Foulds did not adhere to the decision, but
accused him of projecting into it inter
pretations of his own, and also flatly ac
cused htm of having written the decision
itself.
Mr. Foulds claimed that the right to op
erate street car turntables had been vest
ed in his company by an ordinance of the
Board of Supervisors, which ordinance
anil right, he said, had since been con-
Snned by Judge Bahrs' decision. Super
visor Byington denied that Judge Bahrs'
decision confirmed any such thing, and dtÂ» |
clared that, on the contrary. It said merely
that the Supervisors could regulate the use
of turntables on sm<-t crossings only by
general instead of Special order. This
point was warmly argued by both sides
for the greater j tr? ut an hour, and the
whole question wan ttn&Uy taken under
advisement by the committee. Mr. Lynch
made it the occasion t" announce the first
departure of the Market Street Company
from the recntly granted "corkscrew"
franchise. The franchise stipulated that
the company in laying its new line should ;
use iron poles. Mr. Lynch announced that
the company proposed to use wooden
poles, for the reason that it would take
a year and a half to turn out enough iron
standards for the job. lie said this was
the reason his company had been substi
tuting wooden poles for the iron ones now
standing on Kentuckjy street.
Supervisor Aigeltinger remarked that he
did not know whether the Market street
people would use wooden poles or not. |
Then Mr. Lynch came off his high horse j
and said of course he proposed first tc
apply for permission from the board. That
matter too was taken under advisement
until such time as the company shall
make its request.
A TEACHER REMOVED
BECAUSE SHE MARRIED

SINGLE PEDAGOGUES.
Mrs. Beanston Forcibly Discharged
and Miss Hesselmeyer Takes
Her Place.
Because Mrs. E. L. Beanston (nee Whal
ley) took advantage of an opportunity
and the late vacation to marry she
was yesterday morning removed by
force from her position as teacher
in the School Department. It required
the united efforts of Secretary Simp
son and a police officer to remove
her, but it was done, and Miss Hessel
meyer, who did not marry, was seated in
her chair at the Hawthorne Primary
School.
In its endeavor to undo the work of the
last board and do a little of Its own the
present board has taken advantage of the
seclusion of its executive sessions to rake
up all the old rules it could find and for
mulate new ones that would best fit its
purposes. The rule relating to marriage
is one of the oldest as well as one of the
deadest. No board in years has held up
marriage as a sin against the department.
Its right to do so will be tested in the
courts by Mrs. Beanston, who, besides be
ing a proficient teacher, has also the qual
ity of pluck and the courage of her nu
merous convictions. She claims that in
marrying she has in no wise lessened her
ability or capacity as a teacher or com
mit ti-a any offense which would warrant
her dismissal.
Miss Hesselmeyer, who was appointed
by the board to take her place as soon
rrs ever the board was officially informed
of the marriage, reported first at the
school last Friday. Mrs. Beanston
promptly declined to relinquish her seat.
Miss Hesselmeyer reported again on Mon
day and on every day of this week until
yesterday, when Secretary Simpson, un
der directions from the board, accompa
nied her to the Hawthorne School and
took a police officer along to see that the
will of the board was done. He, the officer
and Miss Hesselmeyer waited at the
classroom door until Mrs. Beanston ar
rived. She was refused admission to the

EASTERN MARKETS
New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK, Aug. 17.â stock market
Fhuwe<] greatly increased activity and strength
to-day. The strength was somewhat better
diffused than has recently been the case, but
the heaviest demand was still confined to a
small number of stocks. The majority of the
Industrial stocks were listless and heavy. This
was notably the case with the iron and steel
Ktocks. except for Tennessee Coal, which has
regained two points of its decline. The bears
were disposed to continue* to contest early in
the day and handled the tobacco company
etocks and Sugar rather severely, but even in
these the bear campaign showed convincing
evidence of exhaustion before the day was over.
Bugar ruled above last night's level during the
latter part of the day and closed with a net
gain oi 1%. American Tobacco retrieved its
earlier losses and Brooklyn Rapid Transit,
though rather feverish at times, was higher all
day. The characteristic movement of the day
was in the railroads. The Southern group and
the Southern and Central Pacific stocks con
tinued .to be the center of strength, with some
additions to the former group over those which
moved upward yesterday. Louisville was the
Reader and rose at one time nearly three points,
cltislng a small fraction below that. Southern
Kail Way preferred continued strong, but Chesa
peake and Ohio lagged. The Baltimore and
Ohio slocks came vigorously forward into the
movement, the common rising an extreme
three points and the preferred 2%, with subse
quent fractional reaction. Norfolk and West
ern preferred and Mobile and Ohio shared In the
ttrength, The buying of Southern Pacific was
very large anti evidently by a powerful concert
ed movement. The stock rose 2% and Central
Paciflc gained two points. There was an Isolated
movement' in the Pittsburgh, C. C. and St.
Louis stocks, the preferred rising eight points
to par with a subsequent reaction of -'â _. the
common rising 1% and losing the fraction.
Railroad loci generally are higher, the gains
reaching a point in only a few cases. The
grangers, Atchison preferred and Pennsylva
nia were conspicuous. Northwestern* gained
2'Â« The leading cause of the more cheerful
feeling regarding the values of securities was
the easier condition of the London money mar
kPt as disclosed by the weekly statement of the
Bank of England. The rate for money fell ap
preciably in London to-day, but still rules
above the bank rate.
The bond market did not share in the in
creased activity of stocks and changes were
small and mixed. Total Bales, par value, $9,470,
--000. United States old fours coupon advanced
Â»i and the fives % In the bid price.

Chicago Grain Market.
$ _ >Â»
CHICAGO, Aug. â The opening in wheat
was marked by a good deal of strength and
a decidedly small amount of trading. Specu
lators again were influenced by the action of
the Liverpool market, which showed an ad
vance of \'<i'~''.. and opening prices for Sep
tember here were %@%c higher at "Hie Be
sides the firmness of Liverpool the market had
for a support reports of heavy rains in some
sections of the â¢ Northwest, with consequent
damage to wheat uncut and In the shock.
There was a moderate demand from shorts who
feared the opening advance would be followed
by still higher prices. Offerings were small
and September advanced to call price, 71^8<3>
71% c, before any Influential soiling was done.
A reaction to 71% c followed, but the decline
was stubbornly fought, and as soon as realiz
ing was over the price shot upward in a
hurry, touching 71%ic before the balance of
trading was again in favor of. the sellers. The
market in the main was dull during the morn-
Ing with occasionally lively spots. Several re
actions occurred, but the price at no time got
l*low 7]', c. and In the afternoon the rapidly
increasing cash business injected life Into the
market and made it much broader. Shorts
covered liberally late in the session, but St.
I^ouis and local longs were apparently satis
fied with their profits and let go Of rough
Wheat to more than satisfy the demand. The
close was firm at 71%@71%C for September.
Corn was firm and closed at a slight advance,
though best prices were not maintained. Sep
tember closed %@%c higher.
Oats, as usual, were very dull, but firm in
the main, being influenced by wheat and corn.
September closed a shade higher.
Provisions were inactive, but firmer all round,
although a decline was reported in hogs. The
cash demand showed marked improvement,
which was apparently the basis for the better
feeling in the -speculative market. Packers
bought liberally. At the dose September pork
was 7Vic higher, lard B%C higher, ribs s(^7^o

Spicy Letter Written
in His Cell.
SAYS HE WAS VITIMIZED
CHARGES HIS FAIR ACCUSER
WITH BLACKMAIL.
Officer Bainbridge Makes a Witty
Witness. Called by the Defense
but Most Formidable for
the Prosecution.
. â Â«
Oakland office Ban Francisco Call.
90S Broadway. Aug. 17.
The trial of Arthur Arlington, the al
leged gay bunkoer of unsuspecting
â women, on the charge of having robbed
Mrs. Minnie Maud Smith of $214 last
April, which has been In progress before
'" jury in Judge Hall's court the past two
days, grows in Inter.
The star witness for the prosecution to
day was A Bainbridpe, a San Fran
cisco police detective and officer, who was
called by the defense. Bel Â»re he was ex
cused he proved a most formidable wit
ness for the people.
It had been expected to prove by him
that hi*, representing the detective author
ities of San Francisco, had rot advised
the decoy letter written, as printed in
to-day's Call] whereby it was intended to
induce Arlington to come to Oakland,
where he might be apprehended by the lo
cal authorities.
The prosecution was sustained in objec
tions to Bainbridge testifying as to the
letter, and the officer was then made a
â witness for the people, when he testified
that he had known defendant since l *Â»Â»>_'
and that he had known him by many
ullages, to wit: Charles Holman. Llewei
lyn Miller. S. p. I Â»anforth, J. W. Parish.
Jones. Gartield, Robinson and Arlington.
Witness said that if the prisoner was a
mining man "he had certainly done his
mining solely in San Francisco."
Attorney Major McElrath took exception
to tht witness' last remark and inquired
whether he intended thereby to assail the
defendant's reputation. "If my answer
stands nwn to two inferences." replied
witty Officer Bainbridge, "you can take
your choice. I did not think my answer
would injure the man's reputation or char
acter. I knew nothing about his being a
mining man except what I heard through
statements of some of his victims."
This statement Judge Hall ruled to be
stricken out. Major McElrath then asked
Officer Bainbridge. on cross-examination,
whether he did not bear some enmity or
Mtter feeling toward defendant, and
whether he had bÂ« j en brought to court to
testify against Arlington.
"No, there is no personal feeling in this
matter." responded witness. "I did not
know why 1 was subpena'ed; but I thought
it was to prove prior convictions." He
had said quite enough, and witness was
promptly excused.
An interesting feature of the trial dur
ing this morning's session was the intro
duction in evidence of a spicy letter writ
ten by Arlington to Mrs. Richmond of San
Francisco; at whose hostelry the defense
claims Mrs. Smith spent the night of the
day of the alleged grand larceny. The let
ter was written from the County Jail, and
is given for what it is worth:

BIG SURPRISES
FOUND IN THE
ESTUARY DEED
Park Spoiled by the
Southern Pacific.
MADE BIG RESERVATIONS
HAS EXCLUSIVE RIGHTS ON THE
TRESTLE TRACK.
Evidence That the People's Rights
Have Been Trampled Upon to
Aid a Crosstown Road to
Be Built.
Oakland Office Snn Francisco Call,
IK'S Broadway, Aug. 17.
The city council has just discovered
that the Southern Pacific Company,
through the Water Front Company, has
bunkoed the city of Oakland in tho matter
of the proposed park west of Lake M.r
ritt.
Not only does the city not acquire but
half of the much exploited twenty acres
of public park, but the piece it ha.- ob
tained is split up by car tracks into three
sections, and made absolutely worthless
as a pleasure ground.
This is only one of the jokers in the
deed, which was read for the first time
by a majority of the Councilmen last
night. The Southern Pacific has now an
absolute right to the right of way across
the estuary on the Eleventh-street trestle
now being used by its rival, the Oakland
Transit Company.
The Southern Pacific could, if It chose
force its rival off the Eleventh-street tres
tle at any time, for the Transit Company
has no franchise across the estuary. Sev
eral years ago, when the trestle was being
built, a controversy arose as to where the
LAKE MERRITT PARK AND OBSI RUCT.OiNS
authority was vested tp grant a franchise
across the estuary. City Attorney John
son gave it as his opinion that the trestle
having heen built without any authority
from the city nothing could be done about
it. and the company continued to use the
tracks.
The wording of the deed which has
caused such surprise is as follows: c
Reserving, nevertheless, to the
party of the first part, its successors
and assigns in the premises afore
said, a right of way for a single or
double track street railroad extend
ing from the easterly termination <jf
Eleventh street, as shown upon Kel
lenberger's map of Oakland, to the
westerly termination of East Elev
enth street, as shown upon Higley's
map of Clinton, or in lieu thereof, at
the election of the party of the first
part, its successors or assigns, a
right of way for a single or double
track street railroad extending from
the easterly termination of Tenth
street, as shown upon Kellenberger's
map of Oakland, to the westerly ter
mination of East Tenth street, as
shown upon Higley's map of Clinton.
When the proposition of making a park
on the west side of the lake was first
broached it was stated that the land to be
presented to the city would make a beau
tiful twenty-acre park. On this promise
the council granted everything that the
promoters of the dredging of the lake and
Of the park desired. The tax levy was
made higher than ever for the purpose of
raising $1)0,900 to build a bulkhead and fill
in the park. Now it appears that the total
amount of land is lust a little over eleven
acres, and that the Water Front Com
pany has reserved to Itself two rights of
way across It for single or double street
car tracks. Should the Southern Pacific
not care to use th<- Kiev. -nth street right
of way, which is already In use by the
Transit Company, it is at'llberty to paral
lel it on Tenth atrei t.
The discovery that the Southern Pacific
has reserved the*'- rights, which parallel
not only the Transit Company, bin the
tracks of the Haywarda company which
has almost entire!) taken away th.
traffic fr-mi :h.. Bouthern Pacific between
Oakland and Hajrwards, has given rise
ti. the suggestion fh.-it the Southern Pa
cific must contemplate In the near future
building a croM-town road as feeders to
its Broadway systems. No i>ther inter

ROWE WANTED BREED
TO RAISE ASSESSMENTS
Mayor Snow Says That No Such
Action Was Contemplated by
Charter Makers.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
BOS Broadway, Aug. 17.
The City Council is facing a dilemma.
Tt has been pledged to run the city on a j
dollar tax limit, but when the pledge was
made there was no Idea that the city's
assessment would be cut so low that the
Income from it would be inadequate for
the government.
President Rewe made the statement last
night that he had called upon City As
sessor Breed and asked him to raise the
assessment 15 or 20 per cent, when he saw
how low County Assessor Dalton had
fixed it.
"It would have been easy. said Mr.
Rowe "for the City Assessor to have
raised the assessment to $50,000,000. and in
my opinion it should have been done.
He leclined to do it. baying that the
charter -provided that the figures of the
County Assessor should be the ba^is of
the â  It \ assessment. I believe that the
| assessment of the city is too low for city
taxation. Of course, we, as a Board of
Equalization, could have raised the as
, sessment, but, in that case we should have
to send it notice to every taxpayer in the
I city of our intention, and they would then
! come and attempt to fight It. Had the
I City Assessor raised the assessment the
taxpayers would have accepted his figures
i as a matter of course and there would not
;be any necessity for sending ' out
thousands of notices."
Auditor Breed is not in the city to-day,
but Mayor Snow explained the situation.
"When the new charter was made." said
i the Mayor, "I was elected to the office of
j Auditor and Assessor. The very first oc
casion that arose of fixing a tax levy this
question of assessments came up. I con
ferred with Judge Havens and others
I who, had framed the charter as to their
intentions and they told me that the idea
of the charter makers was that the lig
j ares of he County Assessor should be
' the figures of the city assessment, and
1 that the word 'basis' was merely used
because it had been in the general law.
I I offered to make a test case, and went
j before the Council proposing that this be
I done. My proposition was frowned upon,
j and It was understood that the figures of
the County Assessor should be final as
I regards the city. The precedent thus set
j has been followed right along, and person-
I ally I do not blame Auditor Breed for
declining to arbitrarily raise the figures
of the County Assessor. It may cause
lots of trouble to the Board of Equali
zation to raise assessments, but it would
s.em thai that is the proper course to
I pursue."
A reduction of $7,000,000 in the city as-
I sessment from 1597 reduces the city In-
I come just $70,000, and it Is this sum that the
City Council has to do without, if It be
bound by its pledge to conduct the govern
ment on $1. which the majority of the
members propose to do.

APPOINTED HIM IN A
STINGING REPRIMAND
Attorney Garrity Must Appear and
Defend Hill at All Odds,
Says Judg* Hall.
OAKLAND, Aug. 17.â Notwithstanding
a graceful declination Colonel T. F. Gar
rity Will appear in court hereafter and
defend Edward Hill from the stern reali
ties of what the law has in store for men
who abstract diamond studs from shirt
fronts of other men. Judge Hall so ruled
In forceful language this afternon.
Hill is accused of having stolen a
diamond shirt stud from J. A. Allen of
San Francisco on May 30 last at a pic
nic in Sholl Mound PHrk. At Hill's
arraignment Attorney Garrity appeared,
but had evidently not been notified of the
day set f-T th.^ trial, hence when the roar-
tor â ame up to-day Attorney Garrlty,
who had been working: night and day on
the prizefight cases In the Police Court,
failed to materialize. Judge Hall there
fore directed a telephonic mes
sage t" the corpulent advocate
to the effect that If he did
not come to court immediately he would
be adjudged guilty of contempt of court.
Breathlessly Colonel Garrlty rushed into
Judge Hall's department and explained
that be had not been notified of Hill's
trtal, but the court disclaimed fault for
that fact and reprimanded the attorney
in strong terms. "You have got to attend
to your business here," rebukingly pro
claimed his Honor. "In fully half of your
cases in this department you do not ap
pear when you should, and this court has
been greatly exercised to Mmi you."
"But your Honor," with bated breath
replied the attorney, "I do not want to
represent this man Hill. I" have other
case? to attend to in which feos have been
paid, and I do not wish to !<>s.> time with
this one." But Judge Hall called time and
ruled :
"Whether you want to or not. You
represented this man at his arraignment
and have led him and the i ourt to believe
that you were representing him. It la
the order of this court that you do repre
sent Hm. The case will now be trans
ferred to ,Ju>iu<> Ellsworth's department
for trial." Ami the trial was begun in
the latter's department.
Later in thi- day Attorney Qarrity met
Judge Hall on Washington' street. * They
looked daggers at each other, but the
visionary blades emitted scanty sparks,
and the two stalwarts who a few years
ftgo ran on opposite tickets for Superior
Judge, Hall defeating (iarrity with a nea-t
jmd sufficient Republican majority, went
their ways in peace.

Strange Work of E. P.
Stoddard.
TALKED LOUDLY OF MONEY
PLAYED A MEAN TRICK ON A
BARBER.
Seeking for Journalists Who Would
Receive Large Pay and Do
Nothing But Pander to
Royalists.
. â â¦
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, Aug. 17.
Several people from Haywarda would
like to meet Edward P. Stoddard, who
credited himself with being the son of a.
wealthy plantation owner in Hawaii. A
few months ago Mr. Stoddard took up
his quarters at the Hay wards Hotel, lie
made many friends by his pleasant man
ner and the ease with which he talked of
his father's vast wealth. A few days
ago Mr. â  Stoddard left Haywards and
several people would now like to meet
him. He is credited with always paying
his debts and so far as is known left no
unpaid loans behind him. But he was pos
sessed of a mania for engaging people to
go and work in the Islands for fancy sal
aries, at the same. time promising his
gullible acquaintances that the hardest
work would be to draw their salaries.
Manuel Simas is a barber of Haywards.
He was honored with the privilege of
shaving the wealthy young Stoadard.
Finally Mr. Stoddard confided to his bar
ber that he was looking out for a good
man to go down to the islands. He would
pay $75 a month, give board and lodging, I
while the only services to be performed I
would be to shave his uncle, trim his
aunt's hair and occasionally run a mower
over his uncle's lawn. Slmas thought this
was a great deal better than shaving for
a precarious income at Haywards, so he
accepted the offer and invested quite a
little sum in purchasing the necessary ap
parel to enable him to become chief lawn
mower and hairdresser to Stoddurd
unce and aunt. Simas was to go to
Honolulu by the steamer which sailed on
the loth inst., but on that date Mr. Stod
dard was not on hand, although Mr. Si
mas had vacated his job and packed his
valise.
Stoddard also announced that it was his
intention to go to the islands in the in
terests of a plantation owner named
Churchill and establish a newspaper In
Honolulu which should be rabldiy royal- j
Ist. "There is a little purpose In this !
scheme of ours," said Stoddard. "Mr.
Churchill lost heavily when the Dole
Ministry took office, and he has appro- ;
priated $200,000 for this newspaper enter- |
prise, his Bole desire being to get even
with those who did him up. The whole
thing la in my hands. 1 will engage a
complete staff for all departments and
we will all go down to the island together I
and teach those people that the loyalist
faction is still alive."
With these Ideas Mr. Stoddard visited
many newspaper men and created the im
pression that the intention of his prin
cipal was to create a revolution in the
Islands. Of course, there were plenty of
Journalists who could create a revolution
to order on the salary of about $250 a
week, but when they attempted to nail
â  Mr. Stoddard down to facts he made all
! manner of excuses and promised to return
j in a few days prepared to make definite
offers. One man he spoke to nearly
I caused him to faint by telling him that
! before he would proceed any urther he
| (Stoddard) must deposit $1000 in a local
bank as evidence of his good faith. Stod
dard never came back, and now everybody
is wondering why he should have indulged
in such peculiar pastimes.
. If Mr. Simas of Haywards could now
meet Mr. Stoddard the meeting would not
be conducted under Marquis of Queens
berry rules.
CAKEWALK CARNIVAL

Major Waters Walks for Points and

OAKLAND. An*. 17.â The international
Cakewalk carnival at the Exposition build
ing has been a remarkable success in all
ways. The opening house exceeded in
point of pay attendance any similar event
held in the city recently. Cakewalking
seems to have caught on, not only in San
Francisco, but in Oakland, judging from
the interest evinced and the sal* 1 of tick
ets. The second night of the carnival ex
ceeded that of the lirst night. The match
contests were between Professor McKilii
ken, a local champion of considerable re
nown, who with his partner walked for
points against Everett A. Brown and Miss
Annie Kelly, the winner of the I'acitic
Coast diamond badge championship medai
at the San Francisco carnival, and John
and Martha Steward, the colored cham
pions. Major Waters had a very lively
contest for points with George Steward.
The electric Cakewalk as given in Oak
land exceeds In points of beauty anything
ever attempted in this line In the country.
The management has had two of the
tiniest sets of storage batteries, carrying
twenty lights, ever made in this country,
' and they are worn by little Harry Man

CITY MAY LOSE A PARK
THROUGH INDIFFERENCE
OAKLAND. Aug. 17.â The heirs of A. M.
Larue are seriously considering suing the
city for the return of Independence
Square in East Oakland. Twenty
peven years ago A. M. I^arue
deeded to the city of Oakland
two whole blocks for the purpose of
a public square. These two hloeks are
to-day In the same prestine condition as
they were when given to the city. The
understanding at the time of the making
of the deed was that the property should
be improved and used for the purposes for
which it was given. I T p to this timp the
city has made no effort to improve the
property and the heirs are seeking to
find out whether under the circumstances
the property should not revert to them.
In order to prevent such a public calamity
Councilman Rowe of East Oakland is
peeking to induce the Council to im
mediately appropriate $5000 for the im
provement of this long neglected prop
erty. Independence Square is on the si<!"
of a hill and one of the prettiest pieces
of property in East Oakland.

MUCH MYSTERY
ENVELOPS J. W.
WALTON'S DEATH
Remains Found Float
ing in the Bay.
NO EVIDENCE OF FOUL PLAY
AUTOPSY PHYSICIANS SAY HE
WAS DROWNED.
Coroner's Jury Could Not Decide
Whether It Was a Case of Sui
cide or Accidental
Death.
OAKLAND. Aug. 17.â The waters of the
bay have given up another mystery whirh
has proved too deep for a Coroner's jury
to unravel, and the Indications point
somewhat to a muriW* preceded by rob
bery.
The remains of a man believed to be
John W. Walton, late of Albuquerque,
N. M.. were found floating in the hay
near Stewart's boathouse. West Oakland,
this morning by a young man named O.
Olsen. Coroner Mehrman was promptly
notified, and ueputy Coroner Joe Mcttell
removed the body to the morgue. It had
been necessary for the deputy to wade
into the water some distance to where the
body was pounding upon the rocks, and
the head and face of the dead man had
been badly bruised, but the features were
quite recognizable. From appearances
the body had not. been in the water long.
It whh that of a man of tine physique,
six feet in stature, full featured, with
rierk brown mustache, clothed in a suit
of black diagonal clothes in good con
dition.
In the pockets was found a wallet or
red leather containing a visiting certifi
cate from Fidelity Lodge. I. O. O. P., of
Gallup, N. M.. showing that John W.
Walton wns a member in good standing
on January 24. ISJ*9. and was entitled to
draw $7 a week sick benefits and $50 fun
eral expenses. There was another certifi
cate entitling the holder to obtain thÂ«
password from any lodge he desired to
visit, also a receipt showing the subscrip
tion paid to the Dally Citizen, published
at Alhuquf rque. N. M.. and a bill of tare
of the steamship Corona, dated August
11. There was aiso found a new memo
randum book with morocco cover, hear
ing the address of "John W. Walton,
2131-2 West Railroad avenue, Albu
querque, N. M." Four nickels wen all
the money found.
Whether the man was murdered, com
mitted suicide or met death accidentally
the jury at the Inquest was unable to de
termine. Young O'.sen testified to the
discovery "1" the remains, and aside from
him the only witnesses were Deputy Cor
oners Mottell and Quillan and Dr. J. L.
Milton, who asserted positively that death
had been due to drowning. Wounds on
the dead man's hi'ad were declared super
ficial, and no broken bor.es had been noted
by the doctor, who had examined tha
corpse carefully. The jury accordingly
brought In a verdict of death by drown
ing, "but whether the result of suicidal
intent or from accident w* are unable to
determine from the evidence produced."
From the bill of fare found it Is evident
that the dead man had been a passenger
on the steamer Corona, and in view of the
absence of money or valuables the thc-ory
prevails that Walton, if it be he, was
robbed and thrown into the bay, while
others hold the opinion that the scarcity
of funds fortifies the suspicion that Wal
ton had become despondent from lack of
finances and ended his life. The Odd Fel
lows of this city have now taken tempo
rary charge of the remains, awaiting or
ders from the secretary of the New Mex
ico lodge as to its disposal.
Child Badly Scalded
OAKLAND, Aug. 17.â The Infant son

She had poured boiling water into the tub
on the floor and the child fell from a chair
elofce by. The little one's abdomen, right
arm and hands were seriously scalded and
Drs Oberg and Selfridge. who are attend
ing the case, are not very sanguine.
Lighting the County Road.
OAKLAND. Aug. 17.â The committee
having in hand the proposition of light
ing the county road from this city to San
Lcnndro. and perhaps to Haywards, met
at the rrioms of the Merchants" Exchange
here to-night and reported favorably as
to its feasibility. But one bid was re
ceived, that of the Haywards Electric
Railway which corporation offers to fur

: STEWARD OF THE HYDERABAD
DYING OF CANCER.
Must Be Tried in England for Steal

Here Want to Remove
His Stomach.
The British ship Hyderabad is loaded j
and ready for sea. Captain Scott expects i
to get the remainder of his crew to-day, â 
i and once they are aboard the ship will
salL
Among those who will go out on the â¢
! Hyderabad are the "Hon. H. R. Hinstock i
[of Hull," the "Marquis of Townsend" ar.d
] the "Hon. J. Lewis of iy-iiulon." The three
I "noble" youths have had quite an experi
ence in San Francisco and quite a num
ber of tradesmen are anxious to get them
ashore again if only for a few hours.
H. R. Hinstock, M. Watkins and J. !
i Lewis are apprentice boys on the Hydera- |
bad. When the ship came down loaded .
frum Port Costa Captain Scott was taken :
down with pneumonia and for a time was |
lin a very critical condition. The appren- j
' tice boyri seized their opportunity and Je- |
Berted "while the captain was confined to
i his room. Once ashore they posed aa \
\ lords and honorabies and ran bills with I
i everybody who wouid give them credit or
accept an order on the snip Hyderabad. :
â¢ in uns way they smoked the btdt cigars, i
! drank the best whisky; had their pnoto- j
! gruphs taken at one of the best galleries |
In the city and ran a bill with a clothier '
fur Jll4. \\ ednesday afternoon the clothier !
took his bill out to the ship and demanded j
payment from Captain Scott. The latter J
I refused to pay it and said the boys were
! deserters and nut a cent was coming to |
1 them.
The clothier was disgusted, and upon
! going ashore must have spread the news,
i for the runaways' credit was suddenly
, stopped and they found themselves out j
lon the street without a cent. Shortly ,
! after sunset they got into a Whitehall boat
I and were rowed out to the Hyderabad.
' Upon getting aboard they went to their
'â  quarters and Watklna was sent ac a
I "committee of one" to make terms with
' "the old man." Captain Scott told them
i to go to bed and that nothing would be
i said about the matter until the ship i
i reaches England, when they will be turned i
over to the proper authorities.
In the meantime Captain Scott Is iry
j ing to possess his snul in patience. Al
' most every hour in the day an order
â  signed by one or another of the appren- j
i ticcs is presented to him for payment, and
: it generally takes a quarter of an hour and
tall his pat'lence to explain the situation.
"The young rascals U">k advantage of
. my being ill and ran away," said he yes-
I terday. "I tried several times to catch i
I them, but they are fleet of foot and got
away. When we K<>t on their track I i
; found that Hinstock and Lewis were
passing as honorabies and Watkins as a !
Duke or Marquis or something. They :
j wrote me a note stating they had left the j
ship because of my ill treatment and were
i going to make things very sulphurous for
jme when the ship reached home. Fncl
i dentally they gave me an address tr>
: which I was to forward any letters for
i them that might reach the ship. Wedm â  ;
day night they came aboard when they i
I found themselves stranded, and nothing
more will be said about the matter until j
we reach Liverpool, when they will have |
to answer for their desertion."
Another member of th^ Hyderabad's
crrw who would like to remain In Han '
j Francisco is J. Moat, tbe steward. When ;
; tli â¢ ship reaches Knsrland he will have to :
' answer a charge of broaching cargo, thai
is if he lives to reach Liverpool. During
: the voyage to this port from Australia ;
' Moat got away with over $100 worth of ;
I goods, which he sold to the sailors. Then i
â¢ he made an onslaught on the ship's Btores
\ and ate up all the little delicacies which
! Captain Scott had laid in for his own i
! special benefit. For all this he will have
to answer when the ship reaches an Entr-
I lish port.
Steward Mnat is doubly unfortunate.
H Is suffering from cancer of the stom
ach, and some medical gentlemen are will- j
irifr to pay for the goods he stole If they
could only get him for a subject. They
explained to Meat that death was cer
tain if something was not done, and that
the removal of the stomach meant possi
bly years of life. Moat was eag-er and
willing to take the chances, but the Brit
ish Consul stepped in nnd refused to al
low the unfortunate fellow to leavÂ» the
ship. Moat and his assistant will there
fore have to wait upon the "Marquis of
.Townsend." the "Hon. Hinstock" and the
"Hon. Lewis" during the homeward voy-
I age. J
WARREN'S MUTINEERS.
Names or the Men Serving Sen

â  Short and W. T. Pratt, seven months; G.
B. Wolcott, four months, ar.d Frank Con
ley, three months. John Clancy was also!
! arrested, but he' got off on proving that he
was drunk when he refused duty. J. Mc
i Comb, the cause of all the trouble was 1
! dlFchari,'ed from the transport. The day
before the Warren sailed for San Fran
cisco Purser Bucklin went out to Bilibid
prison and paid all the mutineers off, so
they will not be stranded when their time '
| is up.
Two big rafts of \i\\?s will be on their '
way to San Francisco inside of a week I
One will be towed from Puget Sound by
the collier Czarina and the other from the !
I Columbia River by the tugs Relief and I
j Rescue. I^ast year nearly all the rafts '
j went to pieces, and the coast north and j
south was trewn with the lumber. This
year the structures have been made extra i
secure, and it is hoped that they will i
I make the journey in safety.
The transport City of Sydney was to'
have sailed yesterday, but all her stores i
were not aboard, and it will probably be i
to-morrow before she gets away. The â 
\ Siam with a load of horses will get away i
j about the same time. Of the new boats,'
just chartered by the Government the!
i City of Puebla Ik ready to go into com- 1
I mission at once, the Charles Nelson is on:
i her way to St. Michael, the Belgian King!
j is on her way here from Japan and the
I Columbia is on her way to Portland from :
| China.
The Toyo Kisen Kaisha's steamer Hong- :
| krmg Ma.ru sailed for the Orient yester- I
day. She took away a very large cargo j
and a fair number of passengers.
The British bark Palmyra, which ar- ]
rived from Newcastle. N. S. W., yester- '
; day. had a very rough voyage. On June
] 21 she ran into a hurricane, which lasted
1 thirty-six hours. The foretopmast ttaysail
; the Jib and flying jib were torn into ril>- !
j bons, about sixty feet of the bulwarks on
j the port side and about thirty feet on j
: the starboard side were stove in and the i
j fore foot and figurehead were carried !
away. Still the Palmyra made a good
run of seventy-one days, which is nearly j
three weeks' better time than a number
I of other, vessels of the Australian fleet
; have made. Captain Keller has a host of
1 friends In San Francisco, all of whom will
be pleased to hear of his safe arri\'a!.
One of the "workaways" on the Gov
ernment transport Warren was the center j
; of interest yesterday. His name is J. Ray- j
mond and he came on board the Warren !
at Nagnp.tki with a story to the effect that
he started from New York many months
, ago to go around the world on his bicycle,
i He got as far as Siberia and was .stranded
\ there, and after considerable hardship
] reached Nagasaki. Raymond is an eccen-
I trie person, wearing sandals and tying his
' long hair into a doughnut on top of his
Visiting Nurses' Work.
The ladies of the organization known a? j
I Visiting Nurses of the Conference of]
Charities make an appeal for â¢white linen

THESPIANS` MUNIFICENT GIFT OF GOLD
Theatrical Managers' Benefit Yields Twelve Thou

Performance One of Exceptional Brilliancy and Each Successive
Number Was Greeted With Hearty Cheers From an
Audience Fairly Wild With Enthusiasm*
PROGRAMME, sir?
"I'd rather have a bouton

The maid, beaming, beautiful
and eager, rushed over to a be

brought back a tri-colored posy.

"Never mind the change," said the man.
And that was the ruling sentiment at
the Orpheum matinee yesterday. it was
a sort of "never mind the change." all
round. Each and every one came to give
the best and most he had. It mattered
not whether it was in the coin of the
realm, enthusiastic applause, clamorous
patriotism or artistic services. The vast
assemblage km it was making history.
and though modest was bound its deeds
should be handed down in honor and
glory to Its sons. '
A kindred feeling ruled the multitude,
both within and without the theater. A
little maid in short skirts and pigtail 1- ft
her big-eyed, wondering little brother on
the edge of the sidewalk, and with grim I
determination written all over her freck
led snub-r.osed face marched boldly up to
the' box office. A moment later the maid
returned, bewildered and palpitating.
â¢â¢There are no 10-cent seats," ' she said
to the diminutive man who waited for her.
"They're a dollar."
â¢Gee-whiz!" said the brother.
"You want to go in, sissie. said a
na's"er-by "Well, come along, kids, and

before the Orpheum's hospitable doors
swung open, a stranger might have known
there was something "doing" on O'Farrell
street A curious, good-natured throng
lined the sidewalks, ail anxious for a good
look at the fortunate ones who would go
within. If perchance the wide-swinging
doors revealed a glimpse of the red, while
and blue lights and draperies within, there '
were murmurs of approval, and the same
pleasant greeting was wafted to well
known public men and handsome, distin
guished women as they stepped from their
carriages to the theater. :
Later In the afternoon the curious
crowd caught a glimpse of the players

As for the audience proper, it came early
and remained until late. When half after
the noon hour Director Rosner raised his
baton and the splendid orchestra burst
into the inspiring overture nearly- all of
the vast audience had filed into their
seats. And there was no going out be
tween acts. Every one realized that the
theatrical offering was too choice and rare

j attractive end.
" .â¢ The vast auditorium, with its graceful

â¢ r - scene never to be forgotten. The artistic

gave her a silver dollar.

TOWnsend'S presence incited t'jei'rg.- Jack- i
son to forget the time and occasion, and
in a convenient Intermission to burst into
eulogy. The' enthusiastic orator took the
middle aisle and in mixed metaphor said
something about '"born in the purple and
wrapped in the red. white ami blue. An
honest man is the noblest work of God."
he continued, "but a woman, a womanâ"
ll" stumbled and grew rale and Morris
Meyerfeld rushed to the rescue.
"Are you down on the programme?"
said Meyerfeld.
"I'm not," said Jackson, "but the occa-
sion demandsâ"
"No extemporaneous speaking." replied i
the manager. Jackson subsided, but not
before he had called for three cheers for
Mrs. Townstnd, a call thai was elamur- ,
. ouslyi responded to.
The most marvelous thing about the
great programme was the smoothness
with which everything went. There were
no hitches. Now and th<-n,a number was
shifted, and George Osbourne, looking like
an old Roman, came forth to mak<- the
announcement. Hut the change was al
ways a change for the better, shading, as
it were, the programme and lending a i
Bpicy variety. All the credit for this per- j
formance, which will go Into history as a
record affair of its kind, from a mana
gerial standpoint, is due to Georgi Lask
. of the Tivolt, Manager Morrisey of the
Orpheum, and Harry OrndorlT, stage
manager of the Orpheum.
As for the theatrical managers who
planned the monster benefit In all ..s
details, they were the happiest of all
happy mortals last evening. They went
round shaking hands with everybody, and
I in intervals of leisure looked admiringly
at their good right hands. But their
jo ' and .-uccess has not made them self

TRAINLOAD OF PALMS
FOR STREET DISPLAY
The committee in charge of the decora
tions has been untiring In its effort.3 to
make a display that will eclipse in extent
and grandeur anything of the kind ever
attempted by the citizens of this city.
The plans which it has formulated anil Is
c arrying out for dressing the city in gals.
garb are original In design and unique In
character. The electrical display, which
lias already been described, will be a truly
wonderful sight, but none the less beau
tiful will be the palm and evergreen dec
orations which will line Market street.
The material to be used in this latter part
of the display will represent the generos
ity, patriotism and enthusiasm of nearly
every city and hamlet in the State.
The idea was advanced by A. Schilling
and received the hearty approval of the
other members of the committee. It was
with some apprehension as to results that
he addressed a letter to the executives
of the principal cities asking them to ap
peal t<Â» th.-ir citizens to make donations
of palms. Christmas trees and evergreens
to be used in transforming Market street
Into a beautiful vista. The responses were
so piitmpt and expressed so much liberal
ity that the success of the plan was us-
Kiired at once.
Twenty carloads of the evergreens will
arrive in the city in a few days. The
principal florists have donated their serv
ices to handle and arrange the decora
tions without delay. A large force of
volunteers will do the work under their
direction. ... _ .
A. B. Spreckels. president of the Park
Commissioners, offered the committee an
unlimited number of dwarf pines in boxes
for the occasion, and the generous offer
was promptly ' accepted. Superintendent
MacLaren will attend to the work of plac
ing them. These will not be branches, but
genuine, full grown trers.
Mr. Schilling, chairman of the cub-com
mittee on evergreen decorations, has been
overwhelmed with telegrams notifying
him of the willingness of the people to
fcl )B9 â¢> IBJ fel ISt )Belft^'iS^^iPÃÂ«
contribute. From Fresno came word that
a carload of palm leaves would be shipped
Friday. Modesto will fill half a car with
palms and evergreens. Palermo sends
notification that her citizens have 700
palms ready, llanford will furnish 1133
palm leaves; 500 will come from Marys
ville, and Tulare wires that two big dray
loads will be ready for shipment Friday.
These are but a sample of the contribu
tions. From all sections of the State the
offers are as generous, and it is calculated
that twenty cars will be filled with floral
decorations. ;
In this connection the committee lias is
sued the following:
Owing to the splendid generosity of
the Southern Pacific in placing at the
disposal of the California public its
fullest facilities for free transportation
of decorating material, we are In a po
sition to welcome substantial contri
butions. The Southern Pacific is treat
ing us right royally, and we rely upon
the public reciprocating by only send
ing judiciously selected material,- so
as not to overtax its magnificent con
tribution. Please consult with the sta
tion agent, who has instructions to re
ceive decoration material and forward
it free. Have him advise the division
superintendent of the quantity to move
and ask date when car will be at sta
tion. Must be in San Francisco not '
later than the 20th. - â¢;
GAYLY DECKED CRAFT
WILL MEET TRANSPORT
Preparations for the demonstration on
the bay when the California volunteers
arrive are going on apace. Extraordinary
efforts will he made to apprise every por
tion of the city the moment the transport
is sighted. The fact that Colonel Duboce
cabled that the Sherman will make for
the Farallones may cause some hitch In
the proceedings, especially if it is foggy,
as was the case Wednesday when the
Warren came In with the Colorado regi
ment.
Should this happen with the Sherman
the naval parade will be lacking in one
very Interesting- feature, as it is the in
tention to have the transport steam under
a very slow bell, followed by all the craft
which will participate in the parade.
George Dryden, chairman of the com
! mittne on noise, will request Chief Sul
-1 livan of the Fire Department to allow the
! whistles of the Market Street Railway
power houses on Hayes street and corner
of Tenth and Howard to blow their loud
est when the transport is reported.
Major Harney received several applica
tions from Chinese jesterday for tickets
jon the excursion boats. One Celestial de
sired to purchase tifty tickets. Another
i wanted to engage a tug for the exclusive
1 u=e of his countrymen, but the Harbor
; Commissioners were unable to accommo
: date him.
The steamer T. C. Walker has been se
i cured by the Native Sons and Daughters
: for the parade. The steamer will accom
modate ."00 people, and the tickets have all
been purchased by the orders named.
i lie work on the ferry building is pro
gressing rapidly, and will he completed in
three or four days. Yesterday a huge
sign. "All Welcome Home." in electric
i letters, was hoisted to the top of the
i tower.
Howard Holmes, chief engineer of the
! Harbor Commissioners, has made some
! pertinent suggestions in regard to the
! overcrowding of the grand nave at the
. breakfast to be given the returning sol
diers on the morning after their arrival.
' He suggests that the invitations be lim
ited to 2WO, as the space will not permit
;of any more people being handled with
i comfort. The tables will occupy at least
i half the space.
lieutenant Peterson is very anxious to
i have the Marion take part in the naval
pageant, and an effort will be made to get
the necessary permission.
SAYS CALIFORNIANS
WERE BRAVE AND TRUE
John Barrett, ex-United States Consul
General to Slam, has sent a contribution
from Now York to the reception fund, and
in his letter accompanying' pays a tribute
to the bravery and valor of the California
J volunteers, with whom he came in close
i contact in the Philippines. Here Is what
he writes:
Please find Inclosed a check for $10, payable
to you, as my modest subscription to the fund
being raised to defray the expenses of the
welcome to the returning First California Regi
ment. I wish that I could afford to give more,
because I have a great personal Interest in this
i brave body of men, whose record in the Phil
! ippines was not only faithful but brilliant.
Knowing nil the officers "and many of the rank
and file from the time they arrived at Cavlte
oveT a year ago I can hear testimony to their
worth and honorable record.
I only regret that engagements in the East
prevent my being in San Francisco when they
arrive to join in the hearty reception which will
be Riven them. In conclusion permit me to con
gratulate you and San Francisco on the splen
did hospitality it is showing toward all the re
turning regiments. Such generosity of treat
ment has made an excellent impression
throughout the East.
The finance committee has also decided
that those who are not generous tnouph to

MANSON SUGGESTS A
SOLDIERS' MONUMENT
Marsden Manson, the eminent engineer, ;
advocates the erection of a monument in
honor of the California boys. His ideas i
and sentiments are expressed in the fol- I
lowing letter which he has sent to the j
citizens' executive committee:
It is a matter of pride with all our citizens
to nute the spirit -in which the returning vol
unteera of this State are to be received. But
when we analyze the mode of expression which
characterizes the preparations now beins made.
there Is an evanescence about It that is not j
fully worthy of either our young men of the ,
State nor of the spirit which calls It forth.
When this reception is over, the hlaze >>f nun- ;
dreds of thousands of electric light! Is turned !
off and the wire? taken down, the green of the
r.ilm and redwood fades and they too are re- j
moved, and we have left the memory of a
grand displayâ a triumphal procession. But
eVen this memory will fade as the hearts wnich
cherish It erase to beat. Something more per
manent-something which even the hand _ of
Time will be forced to spare for unto'' l g ? n *J~
itlons-Would tell those yet unborn that the
Californians of to-day appreciate the Patrtot-
Ism and self sacrifice of her Â«OM who sprung
to war when their country called. I. therefore |
suggest that proper steps be taken to erect
at Some suitable point, such as the Park a |
monument in granite and in brOMe. Â»hch
will commemorate the names and deeds of the
California Volunteers.
WILL DELIVER MAIL
ON THE TRANSPORT
Superintendent Ford of the San Fran
cisco Postofflce announces that all iett rs
for members of the First California Regi
ment will be delivered aboard the Sher
man as soon as the transport reaches the
Golden Gate, nearly an entire day before i
the relatives and friends of the soldiers |
may erect them in person. Letters should
be "addressed in care of the ' transport
Sherman.
RECEPTION NOTES.
The citizens' executive committee held j
a four hours' session yesterday, gathering j
together the odds and ends of the work j
they have in hand and arranging the final
details of the celebration. The fireworks
committee's appeal for $5500 for the pyro
technic display was allowed.
The Musicians' Union sent a notification
that It would be hardly likely the mem
bers would volunteer their services In the
parades. Mayor Thelan expressed the
opinion that It would be hardly fair to
ask them to do so, and the committee's
previous request was withdrawn.
Commttteeman W. J. Martin reported
thai he. in company with Congressman
Kahn had visited Admiral Kautz and
Captain Terry on board the lowa and re
quested them to take the battleship out
to meet the Sherman. The officers would
have been pleased to comply, but- the
ship is undergoing extensive repairs and
her machinery Is not in working order.
The admiral will be asked to fire a sa
lute when the Sherman arrives.
The Young Ladies' Institute has char
tered the steamer Grace Barton and will
take part In the great naval parade.
Tickets will be 75 cents and can be pur

Tenth and Market streets. The young
ladies will also participate in the day
parade and will be escorted by the Young
Men's Institute.
Fresno will send its quota of representa
tives to San Francisco to welcome the re
turning volunteers. Interest in the home
coming of the boys has grown to almost a
fever heat within the last few days, and
there is every indication that Fresno will
be largely depopulated when the trans
ports arrive. Brigadier General Muller of
the Third Brigade, accompanied by his
staff and Companies C and F of the Sixth
Regiment, N. G. C, will head the Fresno
delegation. â¢
Napa as a city will not celebrate the
coming home of the California boys from
Manila. Company H of the Fifth Regi
ment, N. Q. C, will participate in the
grand reception at San Francisco. They
will go by the steamer Zlnfandel fifty-five
strong.
