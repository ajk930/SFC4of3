CALIFORNIA STANFORD
KAARSBERG COVERS FIFTY YARDS BY A SENSATIONAL RUN
CALIFORNIA 20. Stanford oâ and \
there you have in a nutshell the I
treat Thanksgiving football came
of '59. It took an hour and ten
minutes of actual play, two hours
counting the time taken out. but never i
for a moment after the contending '
tÂ»&rr.Â« f.rst rame together was the re- ;
pult in doubt. It was plainly Berkeley's
game from th* start. A man with half
rin eye could see nothing else to it and
â  neither could ih* n.oters for th<Â» car-
dlnal. The initial scrimmage gave all :
the line necessary on the outcome.
After that it was only a question of !
how much? answered, when th~ whistle !
b>w, with five touchdowns and as
many goals tallied for Berkeley, to j
nothing for the boys frum Palo Alto,
It was a bitter pill f-Â«r Stanford to !
pwallow. although St had come pre- 1
pared for a hitter dose. Wjth Murphy, !
Its captain and crack quarter, a crip- '
pie and the majority of th? other m<>n
r.ew to the varsity, defeat was almost
conceded, but such a defeat, ods root- 1
ers and rattles, never. Punch thirty
holes through that strong cardinal lir.*?
Who ever had such a ridiculous idea?
Nobody had such an idea before the
pame. not even the most sanguine
Berkeleyites. until th*y found in actual
contest how strong they were and how
weak their opponents. Then they pro.
ceeded to find the holes in that line bo
often and so easily that, long before '
the efid of the first half, many believed
they would make it 50 or CO to 0 be- .
fore they quit.
It was a lopsided came, but It didn't ;
pet quite so bad as all that. After every
touchdown ajrair.st them, with their
W plucky captain getting weaker and
weaker from the awful ordeal through
which he was passing, with other of its '
champions rx>ir.g hammered Into help- '
Jetsness. Stanford faced the foÂ» with j
pritted teeth to battle afresh for
the honor of the university. The bat- \
tie the wearers of the red put up was ,
marvelous and it surprised and tired ;
their opponents. As the minutes parsed '
they grew more Â«and more desperate >
and early In the second ha!f. with more
than a third of the team replaced by j
colts, they played a same that, pre- j
sented earlier, might have materially ;
changed the tune. It was magnificent, j
but it was too late, mart's the pity.
The largest crowd, the gayest and i
most enthusiastic and best behaved of !
any that ever witnessed a football !
parr.c on this coast saw the great i
Â§ struggle. More than 17.000 seats I of
been sold In advance of the opening of j
the gates and a couple o/ thousand :
more admission tickets were handed i
out by the ticket sellers before play
commenced. As early as 12 Vclock j
crowds began pouring Into the many j
â¼ *ates and overflowed Into the great;
stands on three sides of the gridiron, j
From the noon hour on till 2:30 o'clock,
the time set for the game, there was
a constant stream of holiday garbed |
The san Francisco Call
Tr.<*n and worrier., decked with cardinal
and with blue and gold streamers, with
red umbrellas and with sunshades
striped in the colors of California, with
horns and megaphones, bazoos and
rattles, with tin whistles and por.cn
and every other known invention for
the production of noise. Scarlet pen
nants fluttered defiance to pennants of
blue and gold, walking sticks were
decorated with ribbons of the rival
hues, hats were covered with the:ti.
neckties were made of them, bouton
nieres were fashioned of th^m. Flow
ers of the season were plentiful oa
many a fair bosom to declare that t^
thn-bbing feminine heart beneath pul
sated for one or the other team.
Over against the east had been raised
a mammoth stand for the direct ad
herents of the two universities. It
was 400 feet lons and seats rose t!er
on tier thirty from the ground. The
south half of this great stand had ber.-.
divided off for the Berkeley boys and
their friends, the north half for Stan
ford. It had been calculated to ho!d
COOO people and it did. every mother's
son and daughter of them. Great
streamers of cardinal bunting ran
southward from the center ar.d others
of blue and gold ran northward, to In
dicate that the occupants of seats were
the friends of the seats of learning be
neath whose colors they sat. Such a
precaution was entirely unnecessary.
Every one of the 3000 in the stand
set apart for California wore prom
inently on his or her person enough
blue and poM ribbon or hat or pennant
or all Â«hre* to dr^ss a ship. Likewise
with the Stanford section.
And. as if even this was not enough,
the yells. In the center of each great
section a large space had been reserved
for the organized rooters. It was hardly
necessary to reserve these spaces, be
cause the rooters were almost the first
of the great crowd to pour in through
the gates. They piled, the Berkeleyites
into their section, the cardinals into
theirs and the battle of wits began.
The boasts of California were answered
by the taur.:s of Stanford. The air was
full of "whisky wowwows." whatever
of a creation that is. and "give 'em the
ax." The Princeton yell for Garry
Cochran was hurled back by the Yale
hurroo for Chamberlain. Songs of vic
tory, of which the blue and gold felt
confident, were mingled with other ad
vance peans sung by the rooters from
Palo Alto. It was the hullabaloo of all
former football gatherings turned loose
at once, till the uninitiated were lost in
the riot of noises, unable to distinguish
what the university men were howling
about anyhow.
On the west fie a large grand stand
had been erected for the members of
the University Club. As they were from
both universities and all colleges, it was
not thought proper to decorate the
stand, leaving that matter to the per
sonal tastes of the holders of seats. The
result was a magnificent mixture of the

direction people were moving, tin horns ;

all was excitement. It was a â¢.ball !
crowd such as San Franciscans had
road about but never seen till then. It
was the blood and the life and the
breath of the game soon to move upj
and down for its brief hour on the grid
iron.
More was added shortly before 2
o'clock, when the white uniformed :
Stanford band, headed by a warm
young drum major in specs, trotted
in at the northern end of the field to
march time to lend its airs to the en
couragement of the Stanford rooters.
A moment later the Berkeley band
marched in with a Sonsa measure from
the south side, and a musical duel be
gan to vie with the roots for the plau- I
dits of the crowd.
Above it all the sun shone out clear I
and warm, leaving In the air just that
suspicion of snapplness that lends
zest to such surroundings. It was an
ideal day for the forthcoming struggle.
It couldn't have been better if ordered. j
and even the kodak fiends, of whom |
there were a few. were not slow to i
take advantage of its opportunities. Xo j
wonder the rooters rooted and the spec
tators yelled. The Stanford drum ma- i
jor, specs and all. saw his chance and j
got. out on the grid to do a stunt with j
his stick all by his lonelles. while the
crowd looked on and applauded.
At 2:30 o'clock the tiny Berkeley mas
cot trotted across the field, and Al Lean
was seen to emerge from behind the j
scenes to test the bottled limewater he j
had brought all the way from Berkeley ;
for his lambs. It was suspected that i
Billy McLeod was doing a similar yeo- I
man service In his quarters for the !
abstemious cardinals.
It was past scheduled time for the
game, and shouts had been given for
everything and everybody, including
Presidents Jordan and Wheeler, who
had put in an appearance on the side
lines, and unmistakable yells were be- .
ing sounded for the two teams, when
the Berkeley men burst on the scene,
with Coaches Cochran and Kelly and
"Baby" Cadwallader.
And there was nothing but yells from
Berkeleyites for the next three or four
minutes, while the players ran the pig
skin up the field and down again for a
little warming. Then appeared the
Stanford men. led by Murphy, his float- i
ing ribs encased in corsets of steel, '
ready to do or die. And there was
nothing again but noise from the Stan
ford enthusiasts and more and oppos
ing clamors from California, rooters
vying with each other in their efforts
to split the heavenly difference.
There is an end to everything, how
ever, and the noise-makers toned down
to absolute silence as Captains Murphy
and Whipple got together In the center
of the field with Referee Goodwin and
Umpire King Dlxon to t,oss the coin
for choice of positions." After two trials Â«

another yell went up from the red
decked crowd, the men from Palo Alto
lined up on the south half of the field,
their backs to the sun. for the opening
kick off. their foes from Berkeley facing
them. The whistle blew and. with a
godspeed yell from the great crowd,
the game was on.
With a run Murphy's Rood right foot
landed on the pigskin and away it
soared high toward the Berkeley goal.
Into the hands of "Locomotive" Smith
It dropped forty yards away. The rail
roader got on a full head of steam and
carried it back fifteen yards toward thÂ«
enemy's territory before he was
downed. A few small gain* through
the line, a thirty-yard punt by Kaars
berg. a pretty tackle of Murphy by
Womble. a California player landing so
hard on the back of the fallen quarter
that cardinal rooters raised a hiss in
protest, a fake kick of Stanford pret
tily blocked and the Berkeleyites had
the spheroid well in Stanford territory,
th" weakness of the cardinals had been
shown, the strength of the blue and
gold was apparent and Whipple's men,
playing the finest kind of football, went
through holes and around ends enough
in the next six or seven minutes to
gain their first touchdown. There
seemed to be nothing to it but a littto
work against which Stanford seemed
unable to stand. Kaarsberg kicked his
first goal with ease and Berkeley had
6 to her credit and more a-comlng.
Smith did the same trick with Mur
phy's next klckoff and soon afterward
Stanford's first mishap occurred. In
a sharp scrimmage Fisher was cut on
the forehead and for â¢Â» moment it was
thought he was out of It. The doctor

the plucky player was tied together
and, shaking hla head, started at It

from the kickoff the Berkeleyites had

PRESIDENT JORDAN THINKS
STANFORD HAD STAGE FRIGHT
DAVID FT Aim JORDAN, prwldcnt of Stanford University, said after
the pamc;
"In the firrt place it w.is a rase of rtage fright on the part of Stan
ford. The team did not arouse itsÂ«-lf to action until the second half.
and thcn.lt made a grand struggle against Inevitable defeat. The
jUnlvcrplty of <*allf'irnia had a .'cpsoncd team. and its concerted action
brought about the large score Capmln Murphy showed wonderful courage
Jn going Into the gsimc handicapped us he was with his painful injury. Then*
Is only one thin-; that I v.ant to criticize anil that is the action of the Berk*
ley man who Jumped on Murphy. His captain should have done what the
captain of the Harvard team 'lid nomo weeks ago. and that is rule off the
man who actÂ«-d in such an unsportsmanlike way. I don't want to be too
pevcre. but It seemed to me as .'â  it was done with the intent of compell
ing Murphy to leave the game.

were in to-day's panic will probably playâ that is. if some other men do
cot crowd otlKTs out. Murphy and Pnrkor wyi be the only ones to graduate.
"I want to congratulate Berkeley on its magnificent team work. Its
co-ordinate work In the game earned it a victory. Tracker has the making
cf a fine player and I think Ro-iolph made a good showing during the time
he was in the game. Coach Chamberlain is one of the best men I have met.
He is a fine man and a gentleman. He worked hard to bring his team to
victory, but was handicapped by groen material; We cannot- speak too high
ly of Dr. Murphy. He sent a body of players Into the Held In perfect condi
tion, nnd it was wholly due to h'.s watchful care that this was brought about.
I think stage fright was largely responsible, for the large score in the iim
half." , ..â,.,.,...,; s . . â¢ . . ,':.',; t.v.-,V- .'1,;, _.

with his poses and attracted consider
able attention by an exhibition of the
feeling that he might pull the fat out

beaver, however, and was cheerfully
forgiven for any grand stand attitudes
into which he fell.
There were continuous admonitions to
the cardinal team from the red benches
'. that now was their time to score and
they went in as if they believed it and
the Berkeley players had to set them
selves firmer and fight harder than they
had been led to expect they would have
to do earlier in the game. The result
| was football of a high order, some" of
the kind you read about in the meet-
Ings of Harvard and Yale and Prince

STORY OF THE
BATTLE FROM
LINE TO LINE
"I'm only half satisfied," said Womble,
the California end. after tho game. "Last
night I had a dream that kept me smil
ing at myself in my sleep. There never
wa* a moment when I was not placing the
ball for Pete Knar-berg to kick goals."
The reason of Womble's seml-satlsfac
tion 1;Â« clue to tho surprising resistance
that the Stanford team made with the
score 24-0. sending shafts of pain right
through their souls. Four touchdowns
and as many goals was the work of the
first thirty-five minutes of play. This
gave Womble his football ecstasy of hold-
Ing the pigskin for the goal-klcker. The
second half was more stubbornly contest
ed by the Cardinal and the California end
had but a single opportunity to glitter in
the realization of his morphean ideal.

with the officials. Referee Goodwin blew
his whistle and the intercollegiate match
or l*o was begun. Stanford won the
privilege of the kick-off, and Chester Mur
phy, he of â¢â¢.split-slat" fame, otherwise
known as Floating Rib Murphy, began
the contest that brought so much Joy to
California and so much sorrow and cha
grin to Stanford. Away the ball sailed
down the Held. Smith, dubbed the "Loco

line. but then was no rest for him after

stiffened and there was no gain. Coch

and cursed under his breath, for h*
couldn't understand it. Another try with
the line result, and the Stanford men
in the stands v. en: wild with exultant
excitement. California was forced to
punt, Kaarsberg being called upon for
this feat. To the Stanford 20-yard line
the pigskin went, and then came the
cardinal's first chance for offensive play.
Fisher was burled against California
line. Three yards nearer the enemy's
goal was the ball. Another two yards

for a kick, but Hill, the blue and gold
end, drove him into the Rand before lie

at punting was successful and Murphy
punted the ball to the enemy's 45-yard
line.
Seventy yards away from the Califor
nia line stood the Stanford goal posts.
It was a long, hard course and the irk
of touchdowns severe and trying. "Now
la the lime to score," yelled the Califor
nia rooters, and the team heeded the cry.
Smith plunged through a hole between
Burnett ana Gilman for a binall gain.
After an ineffectual attempt at the Stan
ford center Smith was snot with cata
pultlc force at the other tackle and his
course was marked with supine red
shirts. The center was hammered, tne
guards were hit and battered, the ends
were circled. Hall, Smith, Kaarsberg and

bleachers knew it was a touchdown and
every kind of college noise floated over
the Reid with blue and gold tone effects.

What happened in the first half were

Hill brought him to earth at the center of

pain both physical and mental, did his
best to put lire Into his men and bolster
them up. For the nonce Stanford did
show sonic ginger. Smith went through
Prlngle, and the next play brought an
other gain. Then the California line
hardened and caked with never a sign of
yielding. Murphy, In attempting a double
pats, was caught behind his line on tho
third trial and the ball became blue and
gold's. That was the doom that scaled all
Stanford's hopes. This time the ball was
sixty-five yards from their posts, but the
rearing, mounting, plunging backs of Cal
ifornia were ever on their feet, driving
headlong through the bunch of red shirts
that stood In their way. Prlngle and
Smith were used for line plunging. Kaars
berg for his kangaroo leap. Hall and
Womble for â¢nd runs. The merciless buf
feting went on foot by foot, yard by yard,
until Smith was shot through Burnett for
the third touchdown of the game. Wom

goal. Score. 1SÂ»-O, California on the long
end.

and gold. "A bottle of wine to a bottle

out of a neighboring box, both without
takers. For the fourth time Stanford
lined up for the klckoff. Captain Murphy
tottering and eyes dimmed with tears.

distance between his team and the Stan

SECOND HALF.
Stanford at the end of the first half
showed every sipn of disorder, confusion
and rout. The men had their very hearts
cut and ground out of them. With their
captain on the side lines and the Califor
nia boat counting off the score with pain
ful and exasperating slowness they took
th.ir scattered places In the north field.
During the rest Coach Chamberlain was
at them with advice and censure. The
look that came over their faces as they
stood expectant and anxious for the
whistle to blow promised better things.
But before the tide turned California
added another touchdown to Its list, and
the score reached its final high pitch,
31)â0.3 1 )â 0. Kaarsberg kicked off the Stanford
:f">-yard line and then the cardinal wÂ«-iit
back to its old game at line-bucking, but
its efforts were unfruitful. A punt was
forced out of the red heap, and Kaars
berg, catching the ball on the Sta
40-yard line, didn't stop running until he
reached the oenter of the field. California
came ai Stanford once and twice without
a gain when Hopper fumbled. Smith, fur
the > ardlnal, was passed the ball by Kant.
and to th>' surprise of the IT.Oio spectators
Hill's end was circled for twenty yards.
On the California 30-yard line thÂ»Â« Stan
ford rashers were now standing. Could
they muster up enough strength and I i-h
to carry it over? That wan the primal
question that troubled the minds of both
contingents, but not for long. Three tlnus
the Stanford bucks banged away at the
California phalanx, meeting i;iÂ«t as mnnv
repulses. The * < n 11 Â«>nt to the nun from
Berkeley and the crowd settled for a hat

In his position. For a time the atmo
sphere waa redolent with a possible
Stanford touchdown. To the 25-yard lino
the backs forced the California and an
off-sldo play gave them a present of an
other ten. Here was Stanford's hardest
rushes and here was California best de
fense. Had Stanford maÂ«le the necessary
pain It is very probable that a touchdown
would have bÂ»on their portion. Four
yards of the five they did get and ail was
over. The ball changed hands.

this time. Kaarslx.TÃ and Smith and Hall
and Womble were again wheeled into the
action and yard Â»â ;. yard the ball was
forced down the field until all possibility
of danger was avoided. In the charge
Boren was Injured and forced to Quit the
game; Smith followed and Erb took his
place. Rodolph was nervous as a cat m
his anxiety, and he furnished amusement
for the crowd, also for Kaarsberg. who
nearly lost his head by one of Rodolph'a
mad defensive attacks. When the
whistle, which ended the game, sent its
shrill signal over the grounds. California
was on Stanford's 20-yard line, with tho

by Van Haltren. It was Van Haltren in
fact who captured most of the fielding
and batting honors for the All-Callfor
niajÂ». although his work was equaled by
that of McLaughlin. who held down the
left pasture for Sacramento. Good bat
ting gave McLaughlin several opportuni
ties during the game far stopping flies
of a sensational aspect, and he did not
overlook any of them.
The pitching was one of the distinctive
fÂ«-atur*s of game, and the nppiausc
It won was all for the Sacramento end of
It. Harvey of that team struck out six
and had two strikes called on six more
but Johnson of the All-Callfornlas nut
down three to his credit. Sacramento
let three to base on balls, and so did V!l-
California.
The scon was as follows:

the severe and painful Jolting he received to discuss the big mat -h.
move he made was with apparent effort, but a few weeks of
rest will straighten the Injured si<?e and leave no serious results.
"I have little to say for my-elf." said Captain Murphy. "Perhaps
I should ne\rr have insisted upon going In. but I do want to praise the
Stanford men. Every man fought as hard zs he knew how and played as
well. We were beaten by a great team, and in the gritty defense every Stan

that he would do precisely as Mr. Reese
had done and that if Judge Williams
should Imprison him for contempt his :
place would be taken by another member I

would do as Reese had done.
He added that a member of the board
would be kept constantly In the coal fields
urging the non-union men there to quit

PLANS OF SILVER
REPUBLICANS
Seek to Unite With the
Ant i- Imperialists.
â¢â > The CalL
CHICAGO. Nov. Â£).â The Silver Repub
licans tn conference here Tuesday and
Wednesday, planned. It Is announced, to
ally themselves with and to cake ujÂ«e of
; the "anti-in;periall*m" agitation, espe
cially in Eastern States, where the ullver
issue does not attract. Co-operation with
Edward Atkt^on'a following will be
sought. The purple of the Silver Repub
lican* la to _â  In. if possible, with this
new N--i:*> a foothold In Eastern States, so
that their party can truly claim to be a
national organization and thus become a
more effective whip for holdir.sr th* Demo
crats to the Bryan and U to 1 line. This
is onÂ«Â» reason why the Silver Republicans
will endeavor to hold .i big national con
vention of 2iÂ») delegates or more next
year. Confirmation of this plan came to
day from Fred Dubols, former Senator
from Idaho, chairman of the Sliver Re
publican executive committee.
"Th- -â¢ Is no place for the Republican
anti-imperfallsts of New England and the
coast to go except to our party," said Mr.
Dubota. "The assured composition of the
United States Senate for several years
convinces them that silver legislation can
not be passed for many years. On antl
impTiall.-m and kindred questions they
are one with us. I am satisfied they will
come to us. I expect to see Former Gov
ernor Boutwell of Massachusetts. Edward
Atkinson and m*n like them, meeting am
delegate* in our convention.
"We have planned for a big con
vention of 20fÂ«> or more. Our conven
tion, if held at the same place and time
as the Democratic convention, will be
a powerful stimulus against any conces-
I sion by that party to the forces of un
righteousness. We have not much to
gain on this score, however. We are
pretty well satlsned that th* Democrats
will reaffirm the platform of lÂ«CÂ«i and re
nominate Mr Bryan. That will be
enough If. however, they should seek to
evade or subordinate the silver issue,
w^ll not be their allies. In such case we
will do what many silver Republicans
wanted to do in X**â establish a separate
organization and nominate a separate
ticket."

Ten of the Points Scored by
the Badgers Due to Pat
O'Dca.
: atrh to Tfce Call.
Wisconsin, 17â Michigan, 5.
CHICAGO. Nov. SO.-Before what was
probably the largest crowd that ever
gathered to witness a football game In
the Middle West the eleven from the
University of Wisconsin defeated the
University of Michigan eleven on the
National League baseball grounds to-day
by a score of 17 to 5. The mighty right
leg of Pat ODea, Wisconsin's fullback,
\vuis v big factor In the one-sided score,
as he was responsible for tea of the points
â cored by tho Badgers. Once he lifted
the ball to the goal posts from the 35
yard line, and once his punt went so far
that McLean misjudged II and. fumbling.
gave Hyman a chance to fall on the pig
skin behind Michigan's goal posts, which
! he did.
Tho second touchdown by Wisconsin
was made on clean, hard football In the
second half, the light but active linemen
from Wisconsin opening holes In the
Michigan forwards, through which Pcele,
Larson. Curtis and Blair plunged for big
gains. The defensive work of the Wis
consin eleven was remarkable, and time
and again Sweely and Keena were forced
to punt.
The exchanges, while ODea was In the
gum*.*, always resulted in big losses for
Michigan. ODea, however, was ruled
out for slugging on the play that resulted
in a touchdown by Ilyman, [Driver,
who took his place, was much inferior to
Michigan's kickers, though he did splen
did work In plunging through the line.
Wisconsin was expected to show inferi
ority In her offensive game, but the way
the Hudger backs tore through was a, sur
prise to even their most enthusiastic
rooters.
During most of the game Michigan was
on the defensive, and poor Judgment on
the part of Wisconsin In the Ilrst half Id
attempting a fake kick when the ball
was in a splendid position for a kick from
the Held probably cost the Badgers five
points. In the second half also the ball
was worked down the field twico to with
in fifteen yards of Michigan's goal line,
hut In both instances the Wisconsin's for
wards were guilty of holding in the line
and the ball went over.
Wisconsin's weak point was at left end.
Some of Michigan's best gains were made
around Cochems. and Michigan's only
touchdown was made by McLean in the
second half after a run of forty-live yards,
in which the Michigan man cleared his

It was b battle royal between these two
men throughout the game. Man for man.
however, the Wisconsin line outclassed
that of Michigan, even big Cunninghum,
who last year was picked for the all-
Western center, being completely out
played by Chamberlain, whom Cunning
hum outweighed by at least twvnty-live
pounds, *'urtis. at right tackle, was easily
the superior of McDonald and frÂ« quently
pot through in time to spoil the play.
Even l^-rum, at left guard, held his own
with the veteran France. Wisconsin' was
weak in catching punts, both Driver and
Trail fumbling the bull several times,
though it happened never with serious
results. In this respect they were more
iortunate than Michigan. Michigan's best
playing was done in the first half. Secur
ing thÂ«- ball on their own lj-yard line. the.
ball was carried steadily down tho field
by a series of line plunges, in which the
Pennsylvania guards' back-play was much
used, varied by an occasional try at th*

reached. But here Wisconsin braced so '
effectively that the ball -went over. Mich
igan's line men showed a tendency to play
off-side and wore frequently penalized for
this offense, at least sixty yards being lost
during the game.
One feature of the playing of both teams
was the effective way in -which the full
backs were guarded on kicks. Not once
was a kick blocked by either side, and
though ODea was. as usual, slow In get
ting the ball away, he was Invariably pro

CORNELL IS
SHUT OUT
BY QUAKERS
Ithacans Unable to Stop the
Fierce Rushes of the
Pennsylvanians.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Pennsylvania 29,' Cornell 0.
PHILADELPHIA. Nov. 30.â The Penn
sylvania football eleven defeated Cornell
; on Franklin field to-day, the score being
; 29 to 0.
Cornell was lamentably weak, and.es
! peclally-so In the line. Only twice during
' the entire game did the Ithacans stop the
! Quakers' tierce -rushes, and then only
j when the Pennsylvania"* had almost
; made the necessary five yards. When
Cornel] had possession of the ball she
showed up Just as weak in advancing it
as she did in trying to prevent Pennsyl
vania from scoring. Cornell did not earn
a first down, her few attempts at end
skirting being promptly ripped by the
I Quaker ends. Her attack on Pennsyl
j vania's line was also very weak, seldom â¢
gaining a foot.
On the other hand, the red and blue
team played a BupeÂ«b game. The plays
were got off rapidly and smoothly, and !
Pennsylvania was seldom downed without j
a gain. The men worked as a unit, and 1
on th defense the team was a veritable
! stonewall. The Quakers gave a good ex
hibition of line bucking and plunging, the
best that has been seen here this season.
Wherever they attacked the Cornell line
they made big holes in it and broke
through for live, ten and fifteen yards
at a time. With the exception of th.- >
end of the second half, Pennsylvania
never tried to send a runner around Cor
nell's ends. The Quakers' terrific rushes 1
told on the Cornell men, and the game )
was considerably delayed by players be- ,
ing Injured. Three of Cornell's men were
forced to leave the game, while Penn
sylvania was Intact throughout the con- !
test.
Captain Hare. McCracken Coombs and i
Teas were frequently used by Pennsyl- !
vania in her rushes, and all acquitted \
themselves well. Alexander was Impreg- 1
nable in Cornell's line, but his colleague^
were not equal to the task set by Penn
sylvania. In the kicking line Pennsyl
vania had a little the better of It, but both
teams suffered equally I rom fumbles, of
which there .were not many. Fully 10,000
persons saw the contest. The day was a
beautiful one from a spectator's view j
point, but a trifle warm for the players.
Pennsylvania made two touchdowns In
the first half, ahe first score was made
six minutes after the kickoff. Potter
breaking through Cornell's line and run
ning thirty-five yards for the touchdown.
- The second touchdown was made by ;
j straight line lunging from Pennsyl
vania's thirty-five yard line. Hare missed
the. goal.
The Quakers scored eighteen points In
I the second half on three touchdowns and
three goals. Two of them were made by
pegging away at Cornell's line and the ;
third was made principally through Pot
ter's running back sixty yards on Star
buck's klckoff. The line-up:

Multnomah. oâOlympic,0 â Olympic, 0.
PORTLAND. Nov. 20. -In â  blinding
wind and rain storm, on a Mold six Inches
deep with mud, the Olympic Club foot
ball team of San- Francisoo played a tie
game with the Multnomah Athletic Club
of this -city, this afternoon. When time
was called the Multnomahs had the ball.
At no time was there any danger of
cither side scoring, as the teams were
evenly matched and long end runs were
impossible, owing to the sloppy condition ;
of the field. Both teams put their backs
In play incessantly and punting was fre
quent. No attempts were made at goal
kicking, as neither team was close
enough to try it.
For the Multnomaha McMillan made
the most yardage and played the best
all-round game; but he was ably sec
onded by McDonnell and Meyer.
Montague, the right end for the
local team, made several goo-l
tackles and formed his interference
well. For the Olympics their quarter
back. McNevln, played a snappy game
and generally found a hole in the line to
crawl through. Platt, the 19 pound
quarterback of the Olympics, played a
hne game, but sensational plays were
out ot the question with a slippery ball.
The line-up was as follows:
Olympics. Positions. Multnornah.

the Caiifornians' twenty-yard line. Dins
more took the ball for an end play, but
the Multnomah men were there and he
was downed with a loss of live yards.
The Olympics trk-d the line with no gain.
Fullback Atkinson then punted for thirty
live yards. Kerrigan caught the ball and
returned it twenty yards with his own In
terference. McMillan bucked the Caii
fornians" line for nine yards. Mutnomah
kept tliia up right down the Held, but lost
the ball on the Olympics' thirty-yard line
on downs. Atkinson went through left
guard and tackle for two yards. McNevin
was then given the ball and made live
yards In the same place. Atkinson made
a good plunge through the line for fifteen
yards and was cleverly downed by Mon
tague. The. Olympics tried th. it halves
again, but failed to gain their yardage
and Multnomah was given the ball. On
the next play Multnomah failed to make
its yardage and it was Olympics' ball. The
San Francisco team kept using Its backs,
but after gaining about ten yards lost the
ball on downs. Â»i i the last play Olym
pic's end was off side and Multnomah was
given ten yard.*. When the Olympics
again got the ball McNevln made five
yards on a clever end run and Platt
kicked the ball to the Multnomah 15

The second half was scarcely as inter

LONDON. Nov. 30.â The annual Thaliks-
Rirlng banquet of the American Society in
London was attended by 2^i guesid and
J was marked by enthusiastic demonstra
tions Â»Â«? friendship for England in the war
against the Boersi A strikir^ speech by
Embasiiudor Choate ;ilÂ«.nK that line anil
the presence of uniformed nursÂ«-s and doc
| tors of the American hospital ship were
the featun s.
Mr. Choate, in response to a toast to h'.s
own health, which was received with loud
â  cheering, :-.i\>\ there could not bo a better
prtludi to what !:Â«* had to say than a ~e
murk that had been made lit him. "..et
England and America clasp hands acroso
Ihe pea and the peace of the world Is ab
j folutt-ly secure."
He referred sympath^tlcaHv to the loss
es sustained by Uritish families through
the war and went on to say:
"Fortunately KnÃli.-hmen have not far
to look f.-r living proofs of this humane
sympathy. Neutral an America must be.
\ her women .should not be neutral. To
neutralize them would be to spoil them.
These Anieriran worn* n in London, uhn
have tltte.l lip a hospital ship, have done a
d.-t-d that wiil live for all time as a bless
ing ti> our common humanity."
After declaring that the action of the
I'nited States In endeavoring to look after
Briti>h interests in the Transvaal wa<
merely an endeavor to reciprocity kind
ness exhibited during the war with S^aln
Mr. <"hoate said:
"Unfortunately, th*> local authorities at
Pretoria seemed to think that this would
not be quite the proper thing, yet I can
but hope that the prohibition 'will ultl
mately be removed, so that we may be
permitted tn act in this errand of hu
manity."
Dealing with the commercial prosperity
of the I'nlted States and the necessity for
an American merchant marine. Mr
Choate remarked:
"Carrying imde is the white man's bur
den, and we must do our full share The
supreme Interest of the I'nlted States |Â«
to preserve the peace of the world I
still believe that a majority of the Amer

between the three greatest commercial

United States. Our one aim i- to in

ThjE GOLD STANDARD.
THE financial measure agreed upon for early
action by Congress is bciieved to be lore com
prehensive than the plain gold standard declara
tion which was contemplated last summer. It permits
an enlargement of national bank currency up to par
of ihc bonds deposited to secure it, and it lo.vcrs the
minimum capital of such banks to $.25,000. As the
present minimum is $50,000, it will be seen that this
valuable provision will extend banking facilities to
localities row deprived of them, and will put the
loan fund of the country where more people will have
access to it. and can use their credit more readily and
cheaply than now. And greenbacks paid in for gold
are only to be paid out for gold.
It would seem that measures so desirable would

It was proposed by the latter that the greenback
endless chain, by which the treasury could be drained
of its gold re>erve, should be cut. This is done by
holding all greenbacks redeemed in gold subject to
reissue only for gold. As this may lock up paper cur
rency, such an emergency is provided for by permit
ting national banks to issue up to par of their bonds
and by increasing the number of such banks by lower
ing their minimum capital. And as the firm founda
tion of all reform the gold standard is embedded in
the statutes r.s the final basis of the public credit. The
Chronicle says: "The question may arise in the minds
even of the gold monometallic whether it is neces
sary at the present time to make any declaration
whatever; or, if not necessary, what gain is expected
from it. It iÂ« certainly a radical departure from the
platform of 1596, in which the specific declaration was
made that the Republican party favored bimetallism,
and upon which it won its Presidential campaign.
There are few- who will believe that campaign could
have been won upon an unequivocal declaration in
favor of a gold standard, or who will not doubt the
wisdom, from a party standpoint, of now dragging
the country into an unnecessary monetary discus
sion. The magnificent success of the Republican pro
tection policy has made ail currency questions, for the
time being, dead iÂ«sues."

POLITICS AND PUBLIC SCHOOLS.
UNDER any circumstances the people of Cali
fornia would take a warm interest in the ap
proaching meeting of the California Teachers'
Association at Sacramento, for education so directly
affects every home in the State that there is never
any indifference concerning it. It happens, however,
that there are special reasons for more than ordinary
interest in this meeting. One of the chief features of
it is to be a discussion of personal and political inter
ference with the school â  -tern and some of the
ablest educators in the State, including President
Wheeler of Berkeley and President Jordan of Stan
ford, are to take- part in it.
The subject has often been discussed. That our
public schools suffer by reason of political jobbery is
well known. That evil is felt in every part of the
United States. An illustration of the extent to which
it^ is carried is to be found in events now occurring in
New York, where something like a public scandal Ins
been caused by the action of the Board of Educa
tion in excluding from the schools all books published
by one of the leading publishing houses of the city
because in a magazine issued by that house there ap
peared an article criticising the policy of the board,
h appears, â  rever, that the Board of Education has
refused to publish the report of the Superintendent of
Schools because in it he charged that political in
fluence is the controlling force in the appointment of
teachers.

We are profoundly grateful for lifeâ the sim
ple, mysterious, conscious t*'lng that we have.
Your gratitude begins with tilts. We are glad
that we live. Into this pleasurable and varied
blessing all other things which are ours are
gUvn as the stars In the treat firm.unent.
the tribes in the sea, the Inhabitants winged
In the air. If you count life a failure and ex
istence a curs.? you are out of place here to
day. If your creed Is an Infidelity that Justi
fies suicide you have already murdered
gratitude a-.d barred growth and progress, but
counting life a girt immeasurably good and
precious you cj.en pcnse and foul and brain to
a million other gifts and influences.
American life is fullest and deepest. freÂ»st
and l>est. In our constitution, in our very con
ception and birth as ;i nation, in our freedom
by the truth as wrought out in the experiences
of the tlm"!< that preceded our discovery, our
formation and our development Into an Inde
pendent people, we began at the frontâPly
mouth Itork was the monumental sign of the
N-st life and progress of the centuries. One
thing in our American life is pre-eminentâ the
rlsht of n-.an to know God, to worship him
without tho nec t Â»sMty of form prescribed or
proscribe f,y Âr i Â«Â«t nr king. In this country
the Mbit* I* every man's book an his religion
Is individual and of choice peruonal and un

P.ev. Robert Mackenzie preached at the
First Presbyterian Church on "National
Affairs Considered In Their Relation to
Religion." He said In part: "Thla
ThanksÃlvlnji brings the nation as such
I Into our thought*. With all our little
I local afTalrs we had almost lost sight of
that great mother worldâ the nation. Hy
liberty, Industry ami morals this nation
has come Into prominence and has prown
to be a fair commercial rival of Great
Britain.
"Have we now come to the parting of
the ways? Are liberty, Industry, moral
ity In danger? Liberty and Industry are
safe; morality Is In danger. The State of
Utah has elected a man to Congress who
is a Polygamist. Shall that shame be
endured?"
"THE AGE WE LIVE IN."
Rev. Philip Coombe, pastor of the Rich
mond Congregational Church. preached
to a large congregation yesterday morn

In part:
This nation has assumed re*ponslblllti*s
which decUre Its herolÂ«m. It l!Â« no longer re
sarlil as a nation afraid to take its place

I'lrit Is In the women of our land, who have
taken a noble part In the responsibilities that
were and are upon am, We may be thankful
we are living In a Just age. JuÂ»tlcÂ« U closely
allied to heroism. Men must b*!leve their

had all that be could do to attend to th*Â»
duties of his Â«>!nYe without being swami^l
Jn a sfa of pigtail?. He admitted that he
was ay.are of the opinion of thÂ»- Tnarury
Department, but Insisted that he had not
asked f<T the bureau while on his recent
trip to Washington and did not want It.
!!*â¢ further ndmlttÂ«'d that the matter of
Chinese immigration was not in any way
connected with the collection of customs
duties and that It should bÂ«- divorced from
the customs department, but he did not
want It to come Ills way.
In the meantime the coolie brokers find
lawyers are complaining that Chief Dunn
is too zealous In the performance of his
duties and that they will be unable to se
cure the admission of any of their coollo
clients unless they have a perfect case.
When It Is remembered thai the exclu
â ton act Itself and all the rulings of the
Treasury Department on that subject
have been In the line of the demand for
"perfect cases" it will be easily under
stood that this complaf.it from the agents
of the highbinders will have the opposite
effect to that Intended.

TURKEY DINNERS
FOR TROOPS AT
THE PRESIDIO
No Holiday for the
Forty-Second.
The odor of the festive turkey pre

delayed until Just in time to meet the hol
when the men could not enjoy it.
At thÂ«> hospital visitors were allowed to
come and go freely, and the friends of
the patients took liberal advantage of the
opportunity. Hospital fare was bettered
for the occasion to the extent oC the ac
cepted Thanksgiving dish and its accom
paniments, and the corps* men as well as
the patients dined sumptuously.
At the garrison barracks there were
more samples of the ingenuity of the
cooks, but it was evident at retreat that
many of the men had been given leave
for the day, for there were but small
commands to answer the evening rollcall.
Out of It all. however, there were but two
absent and unaccounted for.
The Forty-ninth spoilt most of the after
noon around the regimental band, which
played its repertory through. The Forty
ninth will be the next to go, and to the
men Thanksgiving was no more than an
other day between them and the time they
will reach the islands.
It being the last day of the month all
troops at the post were mustered for In
spection and to appear on the . rolls.
1 hat having been completed they were
formed again and the order from head
quarters containing the President's proc
lamation on tho death of Vice President
Hobart was read to them.

MISS FHENO NIGEO DRANK

Her Father Would Not Allow Her

She Will Recover.
Because her father refused to allow her
to eat her Thanksgiving dinner away from
home.Pheno Nlgeo.a young and prepossess-
Ing Italian girl who lives at 440 Ninth
street, tried to end her life last night by
swallowing tincture of arnica. For
tunately the Impulsive girl's action was
observed and Officer Fontana had her re
moved to the Receiving Hospital, where
she was treated by Dr. Starr and placed
out of danger.
Friends called at the hospital last night
but were unable to see the girl, as she
was suffering from hysterics. One â :
them stated that Miss Nigeo had quar
reled with her father early in the after
noon, and that she donned her best
clothes and prepared to leave the home
for the purpose .if taking dinner with a
relative who resides in the Mission. Her
father objected to her going and tried to
enforce his authority by locking her in
her room. Miss Nigeo managed to get out
of her room and was Just about to board
an electric car at Ninth and Harrison
streets when her vigilant parent grasped
her by the arm and, despite her tears,
marched her back to the house. The
young girl was so chagrined over the oc
currence that she tried to end her misery
by swallowing half a bottle of tincture
of arnica. Miss Nigeo is now out of dan
ger and repentant.
INDIAN CHILDREN NOT
ALLOWED IN SCHOOL
QUEER STATE OF AFFAIRS IN
INYO COUNTY.
State Pro Rata for Them Collected by
the Trustees and the Children
Debarred From the
Schools.
M. F. Holland. Supervisor of Indian
Schools, with his ofllc* in the city of Lot
Angeles, has called the attention of the
Federal authorities to a violation of the
law alleged to exist In Tamaha School
District, between Pine Ridge and Inde
pendence. Inyo County. He .vÂ« that the
Trustees of that district have been In the
habit of enrolling in their school census
the names of all the Indian children In
the district between the ages of 6 and 21
years, and collecting from the State the
pro rata of school money -for them, while
debarring them from the benefits of the
education for which the State has made
the apportionment.
TTie State school law provides that when
separate schools are established for Mon
golians and Indians, such Mongolians or
Indiana shall not be admitted to the pub
lic schools, and that where such separ
ate schools have not been established
such Mongolians or Indians shall be ad
mitted. Holland says that there are
no separate schools in that district for
Mongolians or Hans, and that the chil
dren of those races are debarred from
education. He proposes to lay the matter
before the proper State authorities. In
order that the Indian children of that dis
trict may be received into the public
schools; or, in lieu thereof, that the ap
propriation be stopped.

VII.â JAMES MADISON.
The title of Father of the Constitution
has been proporly glv*n to Mndi^on. for
to his indefatigable efforts the prepara
tion and adopt!) of that document is
largely due. As early as any American
statesman he felt that "unions a . st.-m
of general revenue be established the
foundations of our independence will be
laid In injustice and dishonor and the ad
vantages of the revolution, depend*nt
upon the Federal compact, will be of
short duration."
He was born In Virginia In 1731 and died
in that State In 1536. For most of his life
he resided In Orange County, and he was
never outside of the United States. Ills
knowledge of the principles and practice
of governments was most profound and
his study of the science of politics ex
tremely extensive. He was a quiet,
modest, abstemious man. with little
humor, and was rather stiff and formal In
his ways. His morals were unexception
able and his friends found him faithful
under all circumstances. It Is remem
bered that when first he stood for the
Virginia Assembly he lost his election be.
cause he refused to win over voters to his
support by treating. Though opposed to
any establishment of religion and on one
occasion largely Instrumental In prevent
ing Virginia from laying tax In support
of churches, his own piety was devout.
His first act in public life. In the Virginia
convention of 1776. which Instructed her
delegates to propose Independence, was to
procure a change In the proposed bill of
rights so that it should not read "all men
should enjoy the fullest toleration In the
exercise of religion, according to the dic
tates of conscience"; but rather "all men
are equally entitled to the free exercise of
religion." He had been trained by Dr.
"Wltherspoon at Princeton and had
learned logical methods and k<jen sym
pathies with the movement to break

away from Great Britain. The State early,
found his worth and made him member
cf the Council of State In 1777 aTi dele
gate In the Continental Congress In 1773.
He served there for three years during a
most trying period.
When he returned home he spent some
time reading law. Though never ad
mitted to the bar. he became deeply
versed in the law and had been appoint
ed as early as 1779 a member of a com
mittee to codify the laws of Virginia.
From his retirement he was called In ITVt
to become a member of the Hour.c of
Delegates. He was much Interested In the '
preservation of the State's honor by sÂ»?
curln* the payment of debts owed to
British subjects and paid much attention
to improved communication with the
West. #
If It be true that a desire to have a
Federal regulation of commerce and a
Federal power to tax were the causes of I
the constitution It Is also true that bet
ter cominn: with iho West md
the navigation of the Potomac River
were the occasions of that document be
ing prepared at the time It came into
being. The stream, flowing between
Maryland and Virginia, belonged to the
former State, but as there were points
of entry en the southern bank it wag
necessary for both States to join In any
satisfactory commercial regulations of
river traffic. The mutual appointment ot
commissioners to discuss these points
was urged by Madison, and was mi â¢ by
both State Legislatures. On March ->.
OK, the commissioners, by Washtngtcr's I
Invitation, met at Mount Vernon and
agreed on a report to be referred to rÂ»>ir
States. They also suggested that there
be uniform legislation by Maryland and i
Virginia with reference to duties on Im- !
ports and regulation of commerce and
of the currency. It wa* also sugge-ted
that commissioners be appointed annu
ally to meet and discuss such points.
Maryland acted first and recommended
that Pennsylvania and Delaware be in
vited to aUend a second conference, as
their commercial Interests were so elor,Â»iy
allied to those of the two conferring
States. Here was Madison's chance, rie
had already contended In the Virginia
Legislature that the only redress for th
unsatisfactory condition of commercial
affairs was a "uniform system of com
mercial regulations pervading all the
States, enacted by a common authority. '
and now determined to endeavor to se
cure a convention of commissioners from
all the States to consider a uniform com
mercial system and to endeavor to add to |
the articles of confederation an article:
which would secure the power of estab
lishing such a system to the Federal
Government. Fearing that his own known
nationalist sympathies would arouse op- I
position, tie secured the introduction, of
his resolution by Mr. Tyler. * delegate

eral sympathizer. The meamire paastd.
The Virginia commissioners were ap
pointed and selected Annapolis as the
place and September. 1756. as the time
for the meeting.
So few State* sent delegates to Annap
olis that nothing could be done, but Han
ilton seized on the clause In New Jer
sey's Instructions to her delegates to '
consider "other Important matters" In >
addition to commercial ones and secured
the passage of a resolution by the c m- \
vention calling for the assembling of an
other general convention to meet at Phil- i
adelphia In May. 1757. to discuss all need
ed amendments to the articles of confed
eration. Madison, who was at Annapo
lis, heartily concurred In this, as he felt
the existing confederation was nothii g
more than a treaty of amity, commerce
and alliance between Independent and
sovereign Slates.
Virginia was the first State to appoint
delegates to this Philadelphia convention.
Washington was the first one named, and
Madison was rightfully Included In the
list. A month before the gathering <( the
convention Madison sent Washington a
draft for a new constitution strongly na
tional In spirit and tn the famous Vir
ginia plnn. often called from the name of
Ililmi:: Randolph, who Introduced It. ho
doubtless had a large share. This plan
was the basis of thÂ»? cimntitution, am! In
advocating its essential features and la
standing firm for a national system M.id
lson did good service. Another service,
of scarcely less value to the country,
was the fact that ho took full notes of
every speech delivered la the convention
and wrote them out after each session.
As there was no official reporter and the
convention eat with closed doors. MaJl
son's debates, as they are called, ire of
Incalculable value as sources of lnforma
t'on. All through the summer he labored
wirh the other delegates of that famous
body, and after the work was complete
he Journeyed to New York to attend tha
sessions of the confederation of congress,
of which he had been again elected a
member. He defended the constitution
in that body and secured a vote recom
mending the State to call conventions to
consider the ratification of th. nÂ»-w form
of government. With Hamilton, he pre
pared that remarkable commentary on
the labors of the convertlon known as
the Federalist. Jay rendered some little
assistance, but the mass of the work Ml
on Hamilton and Madison, and to the
latter naturally came the larger part of
that section of the work which dealt with
the provisions of the constitution Itself.

WITH A PANTHER
G. Salucci Has ar) Exciting Early
Morniog ExperieQce at Cannp
Taylor.
I PAN RAFAEL. Nov. 30.â Q. Saluccl. a woodcutter living near Camp Tay
lor, walked Into the yard at the rear of bis cabin this morning Just In time
to see h large panther spring upon hie fat turkey. To think was to act. i
Saluccl grabbed an ax and made for the brute. He â truck it a glancing
blow upon The shoulder, when the Infuriated beast dropped the turkey and
sprang upon the man. His cries for help brought his flfteen-ycar-old son to
the rescue, who. perceiving the danger of his father, rushed Into the house.
nnÂ«l returned with a shotgun loaded with buckshot. The boy was at first
afraid to tire for fear lie might shoot his father, but when Saluccl lay quiet
and the panther stood worrying him, the lad let the brute have both barrels
behind the shoulder.
With a snarl the beast released Its prey and stocd lashing Its tall for a
moment, then seized the turkey and made, off up a canyon.
â AtÂ»f xatninrmtm^hoTved-ihat^whtte the woodcutter was cut and torn
around the shoulders and on the arm* he was not seriously Injured. His
wounds were dressed and another turkey purchased for the Thanksgiving

Now Saluccl and hiÂ« family are thankful enough that their fate was no

TA<" Ma Nov. 80.â Captain Nelson of
the fishing schooner Myrtle, who arrived '
to-day, tells of the thrilling experience of i
himself and crew during the past week
in a terrible storm that has raged on the \
North Pacific Ocean. The schooner was
on the halibut banks when the storm \
arose and endeavored to reach Puget
Sound. Off shore winds prevented and she |
was driven far out to sea. Captain Nel- j
son and crew were up night and day for j
ten days, engaged in what they believed j
to be a fruitless effort to save their lives. '
The schooner â¢hipped water and her '
sails were torn to tatters. To cap the \
climax, her rudder was broken off. leav- â 
irq the schooner perfectly helpless on a â 
raging sea. To oftset this calamity. Cap- ;
tain Nelson threw two hawsers over the !
vessel's stern and drew them Jn or let j
them out. according as he wished to steer ;
to port or starboard. In this way he sue- '
ceeded in keeping ailoat until the storm's ;
fury was spent and then reached Barclay j
Bound. Vancouver Island. Here tempo- !
rary repairs were made and the schooner
was brought to Scow Hay on tne Straits
of Fuca, to be repaired. Captain Nelson I
came on ahead for materials.
The ships Lucile and Occidental have â¢

To say that I man has Bright* dis-

saying that he stood in the valley of
the shadow of death. The end was only
a question of time. But that was be-
fore Warner's Safe Cure had spread its j
benefits over the land.

"I had typhoid fever, and after it
came kidney trouble, and It was whls- ,

ease of the kidneys. I knew what that
meant, so I pitched the medicine I had
â 
outdoors. I then bought one bottle of
Warner's Safe Cure and took it accord-
â 
Ing to directions. The first bottle gave
me relief and I bought a second. Be-
fore that was gone I had gained nearly j
ten pounds. I continued taking Safe
Cure, and It cured me.
"I am fifty-nine years old and enjoy
as good health as any man of my nge.
If anyone has kidney trouble and War-
ner's Safe Cure will not cure bin noth-
ing will. I believe It the best and only
cure Cor kidney disease on earth."
Nowhere does the proverb, "Delays
are dangerous." apply with such force
as in kidney derangement. When
Bright's disease has set in the kidney
tissue is breaking down and passing
i away every minute. The strength of
the body is sapped steadily, surely.
Inasmuch as Warner's Safe Cure
alone stops kidney degeneration, should
It not be used without an hour's delay
when pain in the back and head, a cold
skin and had digestion give unmis-
takable warning?

GOOD WORK OF
WEATHER BUREAU
â¢
Shipping Men Warned
of Every Storm.
Â»
Special Dispatch to The CalL
WASHINGTON. Nov. 30.â The annual
report of Professor Willis L. Lloore. ohi. '
of the United States Weather Bureau,
deals largely with the work of the bureau
in announcing the temperature of the
closing months of 1898 and in the explora- ;
tlon of the upper air by means of kites i
and cloud observations.
No destructive marine storm occurred
without the danger warnings of the bu
reau preceding the storm.
Probably the most severe storm within !
the memory of the living: swept along '
the Massachusetts coast on Novemoer '
26 and 27. IS9S. entailing a loss of at least j
200 lives and many vessels. Hundreds of
craft soujht a safe anchorage on the ad
vices of the Weather Bureau. An impor
tant change in the forecast work of the
bureau was the extension of the usual
time limits of the night forecast from
thirty-six to forty-eight hours. The only
hurricane In the West Indies during 'he
season of â .â¢â  followed closely the estao
lishment of stations in that rvgion. Hur
ricane warnings ere cabled to weather I
bureau stations in the lesser Antilles on
September 111 In advance of the storm. At
Harbadoes eighty-three persons vvete
killed. 15tÂ» injured and property of thÂ«? ts>
tiniatid value of $2.'**}.{w destroyed.
In the West Indies the work if estab- '
lishing a storm warning service was pros
ecuted un ler very gnat difficulties.
The Wes; Indian service was instru
mental In giving advance warnings of a
hurrl< ane that struck our South Atlantic 1
coast on October 2. The coming of this
rtorm was successfully announced nnd
sailing vessels valued at $380,000 were

District Attorney McDaniel Thinks
Buchrainn Was Always Sane,
but Does Not Care What
Happens Him.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NAi'A. N..V *>.â Hugh Buchanan's men
tal conditi<Â»n appear? to be absorbing the,
attention of the people i>f Napa as much '
as It does that of th<- court and those im- |
mediately engaged In tlic habeas corpus
proceedings In his behalf. Few persons
can be found who behove that the pe
titioner is insane. None who have seen
or spoken with him since the beginning of
the pending proceedings have any doubt
of his sanity.
No one is more confident of the grant-
Ing of the prayer contained in the hai> .'3
corpus writ than Buchanan himself. He
has declared to The Call correspondent
that before the proceedings are concluded
it will i.i shown that: '"it is a far cry
from sriak.-s iii tin* I tS to rats in the
garret." Buchanan has always consist
ently admitted his addiction to convivial
habits and the testim >nj oi some of ihe
nifllcal experts who appeared during tho
trial for murder at Marysville held that
Buchanan was simply suffering from dlp
t^'iiKinla.
Comment to-day was largely devoted to
what is viewed as â  lerious technical mis
take made bj Dlsti I A.tt< rney B<:i when
be admitted â  tei that Buchanan was
Insane at the time he wan at SI
CaL, during 1892-tt. Even Bell's :>i<.-n.ls
and co-workers in Buchanan's caus< admit I
be came as near to throwing away
ould with it d ately
doing so. Bell's oi rather Buchanan's
witnesses have invariably testified thai
Buchanan's n.> nditlon is un
changed to-day iroin what It was at the !
time of his commitment to the asylum, i
Gardner's friends arÂ»- now arguing on !
these facts as follows: If Buchanan's !
condition is unchanged, then, according to !
Bell's admission made in court, he must !
still be insane.
Why Bell made such a sensational ad
mission Is a mystery to friend and foe
He had nothing to gain and it may be the
means of losing his case. If it should be
lost It will be on a i- . however,
and not on Its merits, and will men be
carried to the Supreme Court on ha
corpus. The full sl| of Bell's
"break," as it la being termed, only be
came apparent when it had been
thoroughly discussed and anal i
District Attorney McDanlel of Marys
ville will re until th.- Pr
ings are concluded. H- is firmly of the
opinion that Buchanan h:~ always been
sane, t>ut says be would not care If
ianan were not transferred to the
Vuiia authorities, pnr
he were kept m ilnt for the rest
of his life. He looks upon Buchanan as
a dangerous person to !â â¢â¢ at large, ami

REV. W. F. ANDERSON
DEFENDS BIBLE CRITICS
Says That Coming Generations of
Christians Will Be Grateful
to Them.
ST. :LOUIS. Nov. 30.â The fourth day's
session of the Methodist Episcopal Church
Congress began to-day with a dnscussion
of the church and the higher criticism.
Rev. W. F. Ander.Â«on of Sing Sing. N.
V.. defended the critics, believing that
the coming generations will be as grateful
to them as we are now grateful to the
pioneers in Christianity. The speaker as
serted that If we .-ire to liavt a theo4ogy
which will satisfy the demand! of the
age it must be a theology founded on
fact. Any fair-minded, thinking man, said
he, must admit that many Inaccuracies
occur in the Bible.
Referring to the attitude of some
churchmen toward the higher critics Dr.
Anderson said It was very easy for a man
who had not read a book since IS3O to
stand on and throw stones at the dili
gent students of the present day. "We
cannot, said he, "save the old frame
work; neither Is it necessary that we
should; but the old spirit of early Meth
odism still prevailsâ brotherhood, per
sonal service and universality."

CALLS MILLS A HUMBUG
WITH LOW INTELLECT
"Christian Advocate" Strikes
Hard Blows.
T he Orthodox Church Organ Opens Up on
the Oakland Unitarian Pastor for
His Change of Denomination.
B. i part of
his time while he was aetir.s as in evangelist nnd there 5? no reason
to heileve that he is otherwise now. The state of mir.<l that would
enable a i<:an to practice such deceit nf'vr he had ceased to
bellevÂ© the doctrines most precious to those with whom he
labored i", in view of the largesses people lavish upon the popular
evangelist, quite compatible with his pos:ponir.Â« his change so long because
ne could not m fiord to cut himself !<>oÂ«=o from Lhe sources of his revenue. A
man who char.gr* his fundamental beliefs at â  ... it and takes the
consequences is to be respected, but the one who. having changed, conceals
â¢t for fear or lucre. Is to be despised.
It is understood in nr>stÂ«.n that Mr. Mills disappointed those who expected
anything permanently ofToctiv-' or protcoUve of the so-called faith. The fact
that he had changed his attitude drew a concourse for a little while. Hut
his Intellect and acquirements nre so fat inferior to those of must Unitarian
ministers That he could not permanently attract persons competent to ap
preciate them, and the shailo^jjess of hi* moral nature in the absence ><f
the support derived from the established churches with which he labored,
qualifies him to be only a p?eudo-ref<>rm.-r.â K.liiorial in the Christian Ad
vocate of New York von-erning Rev. It.-njarnin Fay Mills, pastor of the
First Tnltarian Ohurch of Oakland.

90S Broadway. Nov. 30.
THE uttered by Rev. I>r. E.
11. Dllle. pastor of the First M. E.
church. In a sermon several Sun
days ago, directed against Rev.
Renjamin Fay Mills, the noted
I'nharian divine from Hoston. on
his advent into the pulpit <Â«f the First
I'nitarian Church of Oakland, has re
solved Itself Into s controversy that has
apparently reached further than the re
motest anticipations indicated at its ln
< eptlonJ Moreover the affuir has fur
nished one of the most rensational mor
sels that has ever been torgued In local
church circles.
In a recent answer to Dr. l>Hie's ser
mon. Rev. Mr. Mills put forth many de
;.'.alÂ« to the charge of Inconsistency in
doctrine* hi* change of front. In that re
pl) be -^ald doctrine would care for itself;
that it is the essence of Infidelity to
j>. !â¢<Â» as a guardian of the truth, and con
tludir.g that when he "gave himself to
i'.<><\ he put his reputation in." For a time
the controversy lulled, but the editorial
rxpr<>?'.<,r. above quoted has again fanned
Into i T'.ame the embers that .--eenioJ wan
niK in heat.
Mr. Mills was seen to-n'.gh*. at his home
In I'U flsnont, where he now has his fam
ily with him. \VnÂ»ti shown the clipping
:r. m tho Christian Advocate he volun
teered the statement that Dr. Buckley
war- :io doubt the editor who had thus
hurled invective, and that presumably
lÂ«r. Buckley had obtained his cue from
ihe a:tack made recently by Rer. Dr.
Ijine.
"I r.^vcr make reply to any personal at
tacks aii;i havt> no Â«leÂ«tre t<. anÂ«wer Dr.
Buckley/ said Rev. Mr. Mills to-night. "In

GOOD OLD SENTIMENT
AT PRETTY ALCAZAR
The Third Chamber Music Concert of
the Holmes Quartet Looked
Sufficient Practice.
The Alcazar management d'lÃ into the
ftrchlves of ancient dramatic â¢works that
have :l mellow tlnpe and Rot hold of
".Saints and iMnT.ers."' I have always had
a certain prejudice regarding sentimental
plays, and the aforementioned literary
concoction Is sentimental In the hlphest
deprce. Jt Is one of those sobbir.s affairs
that water your eyes and keep you sigh
ing; JuÂ«t for amusement, and In thÂ« mean
time y<->u iir n supposed to forget your own
troubles. That is at k-ast what you Ren
erlly co to the theater for. There was a
timÂ»Â» when sentimentality played a great
role In the dramatic arena, but those tlmea
are passed and we want to laugh now. It
floes not make much difference what we
are supposed to lnu^h about, as long as
we ran laugh. TiiHt Is the reason why
"My Friend From India" was such a
great success and '."Saints and Sinners"
Is not oulte as profitable.
Somehow th? cast seems to be affected
with this same dreary sentiment whi< - l>
characterizes th<> play. â¢ Eugene Qrmondo
la miscast as the old minister. In his en
de-nvnr to be an old man he overdoes the
rart. and with tremblinjr voice and hands
he wobbles through his part. <\ F. Mon
taine does nÂ«'t like to be a villain, and
hence his fierceness rlr.es not sound freÂ«*
and natural, of course Marie Howe iÂ«
always good, no matter what she under
takes, and character parts are her strong
point, hence her I.ydia Is one of the fea
tures of the play.
The artistir work Is done by Oortruile
Poster, who has a fine conception of tho
Unlucky I.*tty Fletcher. It la gratifying
to Jintl Miss Foster devoid of that simper
ing mannerism which trading women gen
raily assume in roles of this kind. She
knows exactly h.jw far she, can go. and
consequently her audiences never- lose In
terct In tlic action of the play. Frank
opperman. a new acquisition to the Alca
zar aEKregatlon, does a hit of excellent
character work. His Lot Hurton Is orig
inal as we!l as realistic and the bluntne.su
with which he delivers his strong lines Is
ccmical to an artistic deproe. He Is a
very Ftrontr support t.Â» tho company.
Great inicrest is beins taken In the pro
duction of Francis Powers' new play.
"Mother Karth." which receives Its first
performance next Monday evrnlnp. This
will be a enla nlÃht at the Alcazar, as
the swell set will turn out to greet Mr
Brujiuirrc's music.
Th* third chamber tnuÂ«lr concert by the
Holmea Quartet took place at Century
Hall on Tuesday afternoon. It was not as
pood as the prÂ«*c<-dinÂ« ... a
lack of practice, 'i her<Â» Â»ajÂ« a timidity
prevalent which prevent*! a clean rendl"
tlon of the selections. ThÂ» most ambltioua

THANKS FOR THE
ANGLO-AMERICAN
COMBINATION
Sermon by an Oak-
land Minister.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
CÂ«'S Broadway, Nov. 30.
Thanksgiving services were held In sev
eral sections of Oakland, the Protestant
churches generally uniting in the dif
ferent districts.
The principal services were held In thÂ»
First Presbyterian Church. Rev. Guy
Smith offered the Invocation and Rev. C.
H. Hobart of the First Baptist Church
read the President's proclamation. Rev.
E. R. Dille of the First Methodist Church
read .-. section of the Scriptures and Rev.
Charles R. Brown of the First Congre-
Willlam Kelly of the Lutheran Church
preached the sermon from the text, "Offer
unto God Thanksgiving." Mr. Kelly made
a remarkable allusion to the Anglo-Amer
ican alliance, saying:
"Shall wo not give thanks for the draw-
Ing together of two great nations that
should never have been at variance. There
may be differences of opinion regarding
the wisdom or unwisdom of actual alli
ance between the English speaking na
tions, but â  â â â â¢â  one who realizes what
even moral sympathy between these na
tions means will rejoice to see the family
quarrel ended and Britain and America
one In purpose for the world's civilization.
"We cannot view with indifference the
recent meeting of a number of Governors
of States with able statesmen and re
formers to consider the taking of legis
lative action to 'restrict the growth of
the giant trusts, combines and monopolies
that, in every section. are throttling com
petition, enslaving labor, creating corners
in the necessaries of life, crowding out
of business the .-â¢mall mechanic, manu
facturer and tradesman and producing
conditions which. If allowed to continue,
would not or.lv result In grinding out the
middle claps between the upper and
nether millstones of colossal wealth and
direst poverty, but would create an an
anchistlc upheaval of the disinherited
masses that may overturn the very foun
dation <>l the state.
"Everywhere there Is a revival of busi
ness activity. Bountiful harvests are
gathered and our country Is filled with
songs of laughter of an Industrious peo
ple. Education may be enjoyed equally
Especially In this State, with magnificent
ly endowed institutions, possessing in Its
bounds the future Yale and Harvard of
the Pad tic Coast, education will continue
open to all eager aspirants."
There was a union service In North
Oakland at the Market-street Congrega
tional Church, at which Rev. Alfred Bay
ley preached the sermon.
The Church of the Advent In East Oak
land had a harvest festival, the offering
Of which was for the benefit of the parish.

SUFFRAGISTS
PREPARING FOR
A NEW CAMPAIGN
Oakland to Be the
Center of Activity.
Oakland Office Ban Francisco Call.
Mi Broadway. Novcmhor 30.
A wave of suffrage enthusiasm :
ing Its center in this city and prom
pweep tldally north, south ar>:
the State before the close of the cam
paign of IML This is the reactloii
the depression of the la.-- md it
is hailed with Joy by the
suffragists of Oakland, women and men
alike.
The starting point of the wave is the
reorganization of the different local
suffrage clubs. These have for the most
part been lying dormant. Bpent with the
vigor of their last battles and sad over
their failure. But one by one they are
to take on shape again and, under the
leadership of the most active workers,
begin the strife for political equality.
First in the list of local clubs to re
new the contest will be the Seventh Ward
Political Equality Club. This will not
have to renew organization, for It has
stood atanch and ready for work through
out defeat and depression. Its president
is Miss Carrie A. Whelan. who Is also
recording secretary of the State Society.
The suffragists of the Second Ward are
now in line, too, having organized this
week at the residence of Dr. A. M Shan
non. The Third Ward Club. like th*
Seventh Ward, has been active all
through, holding regular meetings at the
J. C. Campbell residence. The Frultvale.
Fifth Ward and Berkeley clubs are stir
ring to life again. Alameda, under the
direction of such ladies as Mrs. Judge
Way mi re and Mrs. Wood, has kept
abreast of the best done In Oakland. So
that things look hopeful and bright for
good work on this side of the bay.
When Mrs. Carrie Chapman a tt and
Miss Hay were In Oakland recently they
declared that nowhere in the State had
they met such enthusiasm and such ac
tivity in suffrage work. This deserved
praise has so stimulated the suffrage
workers In the county that they have de
termined to not wait longer to buckle
their political armor on. Greatly missing
Mrs. Lloyd Baldwin, who now resides in
San Francisco, and who has always been
such a faithful suffrage advocate, they
will rally with such women at their head
as Mrs. William Keith and Mrs. George
Haight of Berkeley. Mrs. Waymlre and
Mrs. Wood of Alameda. Mrs. Emma
Shafter Howard. Miss Whelan. Mrs
Sarah C. Borland and Mrs. McClees of
this city.
Alameda County. In spite of hard work
during the last campaign, wen: against
the giving of th* fran< i
This proves, sufTrag.; workers believe,
that harder work than ever should be
here. Many women who do not from
month to month take an active share in
meetings and the like have declared thnt
wh.-n the right is on again they will take
a share In It.
"We arÂ« rary hopeful." said m:Â»>s
Wheh.n to-day, '"tnat Alameda Count y
will rnaki- a Rood fli?ht n.-xt time, and
the work has already l.ogiin."

Up was followed by â¢
Brunswick, who related his exp*r
In Spain a fortnight ago while on a -.
All day the Kaiser remained at Potsdam.
Among thÂ«; officials who have arrived to
Bee him from various parts of the em
pire is Dr. yon Mumm Sehwartzenstctn,
who. since his arrival from Washington,
has bÂ«en at his home in Haden. Dr. Yon
Mumm had a long conference this after
noon with Count yon Bulowr. the For
eign Minister, and this evening he gave
it general nummary Â»t the present rela
tions of Germany with the United State*,
speaking cautiously with reference t<Â»
commercial issues, especially the meat
and fruit question*. H* remarked that
there was a considerable difference of
opinion regarding these matters, and that
Germany was Justly complaining of dis
crimination against Orman sugar.
When tho correspondent of th* Asso
ciated Press sÂ«UK;rei<ted the great difficulty
of reaching a satisfactory settlement of
commercial differences at the present
time, especially In view of the fact that
th â¢ l. nlted Si.i'.-t U awaiting Germany's
action on meat and Germany Is awalMng
the new tariff schedule and also is un
willing to prejudice pending negotiation*
with other important countries relative to
commercial treaties by prematurely con
cluding one with America, Dr. Yon Mumm
did not dissent and later In the Interview
he virtually adopted the sug>c>-.<4tion.
Discussing the present political rela
tions between the two powers the German
diplomatist spoke freely, declaring that
the Samoa agreement was a cause of
satisfaction to all three powers and had
removed a â¢â¢powder cask from interna
tional politics. It was nonsense, he as
serted, to say that the United States still
refused to ratify the Anclo-German agree
ment, alleging that as a matter of fact
when he left Washington an agreement
had already been reached. LÂ»r. Yon
Mumm remarked that thÂ» American de
mand in the partition projected had been
known all along and was agreed to from
the first, namely, the possession of
Tutulla. with a safe harbor at Pago-Pago
and the other Islands subsidiary to It.
The celebration it Thantcsglvlng day
at the Kaiserhof this evening was one
of the most successful celebrations In tho
history of the American colony In Ber
lin. Nearly .100 persons were present,
most of them being young men and
women students John B. Jackson, sec
retary of the United States â¢ Embassy,
presided and among those present were
I'nlted States Consul General Mason.
Senator Mitchell. Professor Hart of Ann
Arbor. Dr. Dickie Hammond of Cornell
and Professor Stevens of Yale.
Professor Stevens made the only
speech, dwelling upon the debt Amer
icans owe to German rclence, as testified
by the number of American students In
Berlin. He raised a cheer by adding
that, while recognizing her debt to Ger
man/. America could not forget th* ties
binding her to England. "X\e are Eng
land's loyal daughter." he said, "despite,
the fact that she has net always treated
us as a mother should a child. Although
later Â«he made ample reparation."
During the banquet this evening, upon
the suggestion of Mr Jackson, a dis
patch was sent to President MrKlnley
assuring him of the "loyalty and sym
pathy of the exiles." A similar dispatch
wan sent to Kmbamador White at
Alasslo. Italy. After dinner there wm

"LONGSHOT"
CONLEY HAS
AN INNING
Won the Paxton Handicap on
Rosormonde â Immense
Crowd at Oakland.
TIIRONO of WO
people completely
packed the (Treat
grand stand and
P ring at Oak
track yester
day. The occasion
was graced by an
unusually lnrge
quota of the fair
-. x whoa* ipleling
proclivities far sur-
passed the "football
woman." Guest* of the association occu
pied every nook and point of vantage on
the clubhouse \erandas or lolled about on
settees ar.d chairs on the lawn. There
was no lack of accommodation for the J
speculatlvely inclined, as twenty-two
layers of odds displayed their elates In
the rir.K. and when the smoke of battle
cleared away the advantage was all with
the players. Favorites almost swept i
everything befcre them, taklns all but
two events.
The weather was warm and clear as a ,
day in August, but unfortunately the 1
track was still slow from the effect? of
the recent rainfall. The different events
were all well contested, awakening fre
quent bursts of enthusiasm, but fast time |
was out of the question.
"Lonpshot" Conley's followers at la^t '
had their patience and fortitude reward- \
ed, for the colored chap piloted the !
dainty Rosormcnde to victory In the Pax
ton handicap over one mile and a furlong.
From 5. the price about the mare was
backed at the last to 3Vj. For a time It
looked a* if the sr.c-ak made by little !
Walsh on the llght-welchted Dare II
would prove successful, but Rosormonde
grabbed him In the stretch, and. driving
hard, won by a neck. Plodding old Ring
master fell heir to the show. The calca
lative set flpured that the route woull be
too far for Pat Morrlsey, and their prog
nostications were correct, for after being
prominent part of the way he linishea
last.
Barney Sohrelber's Forte annexed the
handicap over the cup distance, two and
a quarter miles, defeating Billy Me-
Clo.Â«key. Reolia ar.d St. Algnon without
drawing a long breath at the end. H -
carrlfHl 110 pounds and Pullman, and
passing Billy McClOÃkey the last quarter
â whlcn early showed he would be the
contenderâ won by four lengths In 4:07Â»i.
Reolia seemed still sore from the pfr>et<>
of hvr last hard Journey, and ihouji'a
willing could not get up. taking third
place. . '
Ravenna, a pronounced favorite, hesran
operations by bf-a:ing a big field in the
opening Beven furlong run. Thorpe had
the leg up. and drawing away In the run
homo V-d Owyhee, i SMo 1 shot, over the
line two lonKthf. Sylvan Lass, another
lone shot, was third.
Midget Jack Martin and King Carnival
were all the crowd wanted in the -print
which followed, the short price of 3 to J
b*>ir.g readily accepted. Schreiber's Florl
dan. one of thÂ«Â» two-year-old.Â« star'insr,
cut out the pa^e Into the stretch, where
hÂ«* had about enough. The first choice
: th.-n went to the iront. winning by a
couple of lengths from Moringa. It vms
I the latter's lirst start and 15 to 1 was laid
about him.
The defeat of Southern Girl by Tellow
Tail was no doubt the biggest surprise of
the afternoon. The Bums & Water
house filiy was plunged on at odds of 4 to
:. and Fost'-r's young piant showed her a
cloan. pair of heel? from the Jump off.
Decoy, away none too well, was dorn^l
three lengths for the place by the
favorite.

Refers in Generous Terms to
His Recent Visit.
LONDON, Nov. 30.â Sir Thomas Llpton.
speaking at the annual dinner of the
Temple Yacht Club In the Hotel Cecil
this evening. Lord Charles Beresford pre
siding. referred in generous terms to his
recent vJMt to the l nited States.
â "No imin." said Sir Thomas, could
have hed fairer or better treatment; no
man could have met with a more gener
ous welcome than I had and received ftt
the hands of the greatest and of the hum
blest in America. I can sre no room for
discouragement, and unless some une else
challenges. I shall certainly do so myself
very soon. All I can say i.* that we had a
fair ami square race and got a fair and
s<juarÂ«- licking."
These sentiments were received with
prolonged cheers, the entire company ris
ing and singing "For He's a Jolly "Good
Fellow."

SENTIMENT OF HOUSE
IS AGAINST ROBERTS
Poll of Representatives Shows
That Only Two Openly De=
clare They Favor the
Polygamist.
For Rober<S"=2. Against RobertsH23. Non-com=
mittat but mainly opposed to Robertsâ l 34. Total, 259.
In â  careful poll of the members of the
House of Representatives, made by The
Call on the question of permitting Brig
ham H. Roberts, the Mormon member
from Utah, to take his seat, the views of
more than two-thirds of the membership
have bern obtained. Of this number only
twoâ one From Michigan and one from
Georgiaâ declare themselves In favor of
admitting Mr. Roberts, regardless of the
Charge brought against him. The Call's
canvass shows an overwhelming senti
ment In favor of unseating the member
elect from Utah.
While more than one-third of the mem
| bers express themselves emphatically as
Intending to vote to unseat Mr. Roberts,
this proportion does not by any means In
dicate the whole number of those who
will so vote. Many new members who
have not yet taken their seats are disin
clined to express their opinions for publi
cation. There are many who take the
i ground that it would be Improper for
j them to announce In advance their opin
; ion in a case on which they are to sit In
judgment. In almost every Instam-e these
members, while giving non-committal in
! trrviews for publication, privately admit
1 that they expect the evidence to be such
I as to warrant thorn in voting against Mr.
! Roberts.
It is probable that Mr. Roberts will be
: â worn In- when Congress assembles. Then
' will come the proceedings to expel him
Mr. Roberts declines. to discuss his case,
i Upon bring Informed of the strength of
j the opposition, he declared: "The mem
j bers have prejudiced the case."

GATHERING OF
MAGNATES OF A
GREAT CHURCH
Bishop Nichols Re-
turns Home.
The Episcopal Rishop nf California ar
rived week after a months so
journ in the Bast At Bt lx>uis he a
ed the missionary council of the church
ar.d met delegates from many of the dio
ceses throughout the United States. In
addition to the ordinary business of the
council Bishop Nichols was especially in
terested n learning the disposition of
tthe crr.iroh toward the meeting of the
great triennial convention, v.hi -h is to
convene In San Francisco In October. UOL
The Bishop of Sacramento was also tn
attendance and upon every occasion add
ed his eloquent voice in "support of San
Francisco's ad Blslwp || re
land Is now In the East and has several
Important addresses to make before Influ
ential church bodies. He la also charged
with ; f i ry an
ments In connection with this great gain
ing of churchmen. With the asatstancÂ« of
all the Western Blsl can be no
doubt that the convention will really meet
as proposed. Some little opposition has
arisen on SCO ant of the distance and the
time consumed In coming and going, but
solely from the older generation. The
young men of the church are all in favor
Of Han Francisco. Pour years ago the
convention rret at Minneapolis and the
pame objections were raised then, but
the resell was most gratifying to the
broader minds In the church and profit
able as well, the principal benefjt accru
ing to the staid, conservative element,
who for the first time realized that ill the
power ani greatness of the church was
not conflm a exclusively to the thickly
populated F&Pt.
Bishop Nichols states that he found a
rapidly growing Interest In favor of Sun
Francisco. One sanguine churchman ex
pressed the c pinion tnat If the prosperous
conditions of the country are not Inter
rupted there will be a larger convention
in IMI th in was ever before held. The
railroads havi ilready promised extreme
ly low rates and that will have great in
fluence in inducing many Eastern church
men In taking the California trip and
bringing will, them a large constituency
of church i eople. who are not delegates.
It is also understood that in all the dio

will be given those who will promise at
tendance. The influence of all the Bish
ops of dloo Fes located west of the Mis
sissippi River will be brought to near
upon the whole church to make the con
vention great in respect to numbers and
representatives of the intellectual stand
ing and wealth of the church.
The convention will be large In point
of numbers. There are now elghty-flve
Bishops entitled to seats and 255 clergy
and as many lay delegates, making a
lower house 510 In number. The Bishops
act by themselves as a separate body.
The assemblage will not only be the first
great national ecclesiastical gathering of
the new century, but will be notable as
bringing together the devotion. wÂ«MlÂ«.h
and intellect of a great and expanding
church, whose Bishops claim a direct .md
continuous descent from the apostles and
whose clergy and laity represent the
scholarship and culture of the country.
The Chief Justice of the United States
has represented his diocese In the Uen
ernl Convention for a generation and will
be present, together with Senator Ed
munds of Vermont, famed as a lawyer
and legislator. Several Governors of
States and numbers of men known
throughout th*Â» country will be am mg
the honored delegates. The Intention of
the California Bishops Is to make the
convention of 1901 representative of the
wide sway of the church throughout tnÂ©
world.

SPEAKS FOR NEW
TRIPLE ALLIANCE
Charr)berlaio F aVors a Combine
Between America, Great
Britain and Germany.

jre which must cause anxiety to the

A new triple alliance between the Teu
onic race and the two preat branches of
he Anpln-Saxons would, said the Colo
ial Secretary, be a potent Influence Jn
he future world.
Referring to the attacks of the foreign
Mr. Chamberlain said these n>ws
- had not even spared "the almost
sacred person of the Queen."
This, continued the speaker, provoked
natural indignation, "which may have
serious '-onsequences if our neighbors do
not mend th.'ir ways."
An outburst of cneertnir greeted this
threat of the Colonial Secretary. Jt Â«v

LONDON, Nov. 30.â Joseph Chamber
lain. Secretary of State for the Colonies,
In a speech at a luncheon at Leicester
to-day, said that ever since the great
split In the Liberal party he had found
himself a mark for the slanders and mis
representations of the "baser sort of
politicians," but that he had found com
pensation In the generous appreciation
of the majority of the countrymen.
Continuing. Mr. Chamh. rlain said he
was deeply gratified that the foreign rela
tions of Gnat Britain were so satisfac
tory, and assorted that the country owed
a debt of gratitude to I^ord Salisbury for
the great Improvement In Great Britain's
position. It wan especially gratifying, he
said, to note the friendly relations exist
ing betw .â <â¢!! the Anglo-Saxon branches.
saving that the understanding between
t!..- United BtatM and Grout Hritaln w.is
Indeeo a guarantee of the peace of the
world.
Tins statement was greeted with chee-s
it was of the utmost Importance, Mr.
Chamberlain further remarked, that
Qreal Britain should ncit remain Isolated
in Europe, and her natural alliance was
wit 11 the great German empire. They had
bad difficulties with Oermany, but the
Interests and sentiments were the same.
The speaker explained that he ustvl the
word "alliance." but it mattered little
whether they had an alliance committed
to paper or an understanding which ex
isted In the minds of the statesmen o.' the
representative countries. A determination
In every cans., to look fnr favorable mo
tives upon the part of those with whom
friendship was desired would be an
enormous advantage to both nations con
cerned and others.
Dealing with the attitude of foreign na
tions. Mr. Chamberlain said:
"I rejoice, and it is perhaps natural, for
I have taken a personal interest In th"
matter, In the friendly feeling, which I
hope is now permanent, between the two
freat branches of the Anglo-Saxon race,
have so many friends in the United
States, almost as many as 1 have here,
and I can conceive of no greater disasters
to the two countries than to find them
selves hostile to each other. Yet. I re
member, when 1 first visited America, my
surprise and astonishment at the evi
dence given me by statesmen and poli
ticians and In articles In the press of con
stant suspicion of the objects of Great
Britain, constant doubts as to her integ
rity and a general unfavorable estimate
of our prospects and character.
"Once, addressing a great meeting In
Philadelphia, I ventured to say that what
we wanted was a new Columbus to set
out from America, discover the United
Kingdom and return to America and tell
them something they did not know of
the character of the strange inhabitants
of those islands.
"This Ml-tVeling was due no doubt to
many causesâ to the fact that the
United StateÃ has never been at war
with any great power but England; due
to their traditions, extending over a cen
tury; due to a feeling that the sympathy
of Great Britain was not with them in
their civil war, and to the general belief
that the people of Great Britain would
t,ee with satisfaction any harm that
might befall them.
â¢it appeared to me almost useless to
contradict these mistaken opinions. But
what the asseverations of statesmen could
not do was done by the sympathy we were
willing to give when the United States
found itsÂ°lf the object of suspicion,
which has so often accompanied our ov.ri
transactions wh. n England engaged in a
war of Justice against oppression a war
In favor of civilization and good govern
ment.
"Our actions proved to the Americans
that we were Indeed one people, of the
same thoughts and guided by the same
principle*. The assurance thai was given
them in the course of the Spanish war
will. I believe, never be forgotten, and
has placed our relations in an admirable
position. The union, the alliance, if you
please, the understanding between ih<-Â«*Â»
two great nations, is. Indeed, a guarantee
of the peace of the world. But there is
something more which I think any far
seeing Kniflish statesman must have long
desiredâ that we should not remain p.-i
manently isolated from the continent of
Europe, and I think it must have ap
peared evident to everybody that the nat
ural alliance Is between ourselves ami the
German cmi ire. We have had our differ
ences, quarrels and contentions, but they
have all uc^n about petty matters. Tbote
difficulties have been gradually removed
until now I cannot conceive that any
point can arise in the Immediate future
