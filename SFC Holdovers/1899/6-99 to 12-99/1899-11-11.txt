BOERS PREPARING TO FACE
THE BRITISH REINFORCEMENTS
Kruger's Forces Not Only Sur
round and Bombard Lady
smith, but Are Also in Posi
tion to Meet British Troops
Sent From Durban.
While the British War Office Continues to
Suppress News of the True Situation of
Afiairs in South Africa There Is Re
newed Talk of " Muddling" and Unpre
paredness.
LONDON, Nov. ll.â The news from Natal received
in London, though meager, all points to one conclu
sion. The Boers are endeavoring to surround Lady
smith in such a way as to not only completely invest
the town and garrison, but also to be in position to
meet any British reinforcements that may be sent
from Durban.
No fresh battles or even skirmishes have been re
ported. There are signs that the greater part of the
Boer forces are concentrating between Ladysmith and
Colenso. In this position Ladysmith is effectually cut
off from all help, and at the same time the enemy is
well placed to meet any British force advancing from
hstcourt. The risk to the Boers is great in case of
retreat, as General White will certainly intercept them,
unless they fall back. in the direction of Twinta Pass
and Olivers Hock. If they should take either of these
routes they must abandon most of their guns.
The bombardment of Ladysmith continues. Prob
ably the Boers by now have several heavy guns in
place, so that the British garrison may have to endure
severe trials. The Boer shells are said to be bursting
better than hitherto, and the fire of their big weapons
is becoming more effective.
LONDON, Nov. 10.â The British War Office has received from
General Bullet* the following dispatch :
â¢ CAPE TOWN, Thursday evening, Nov. 9.â Have received by
pigeon post from General White to-day the following:
"The bombardment at long range by heavy guns continues

being done.
"The (Toers sent in to-day a number of refugees from the
Transvaal under a flag of truce. A flag of truce from Ladysmith j

Lioer guns fired on it before it reached our pickets.
"Major Gate of the Royal Engineers was wounded to-day
while sending a message.
"The intrenchments arc daily growing stronger, and the sup
ply of provisions is ample."

street until yesterday (Friday)
morning. It is believed that the
War Office received further dis-
patches last evening, but nothing
has been published.
At a banquet in the city of
London yesterday the Duke of
Cambridge, speaking of the war,
said:
"We ought never to have al
lowed ourselves to be in the posi
tion in which the outbreak of the i
war found us. I could cry over
the valuable lives which might
have been spared had we been
better prepared."
It is said that General Duller
never expected to commence the
campaign before Christmas, and
it now looks as though this would
be the case. Certainly no artil
lery can reach Durban before No
vember 14. and without addi
tional guns an advance from Est
court would be impossible.
No doubt, as Lord Salisbury
said in a recent speech, England
will "muddle through it," and
yet another illustration of mud
dling has become apparent in the
fact that gunnery . instructors
have only just arrived at Wool
wich arsenal for instruction in
siege train duties. Although
hurried preparations are being
made to prepare the siege trains,
the fact that the men are at I)ev
enport and the guns at Woolwich
seems to show that the idea of the
siege train was quite an after
thought.
The Morning Post says: What
will come of such muddling, if we
ever come to fighting a foe able
to turn it to advantage? Some
radical reforms are still needed
in our mobilization arrange
ments.
The statement from Ladysmith
that the British guns don't reply
to the Boer artillery because the
concrete beds for the guns have
not yet hardened is interpreted
in some quarters to mean simply
i that the British are husbanding
their ammunition, as the Boer
fire is only a trick to get the Brit
ish to waste shells.
f Among the few items that have
arrived from the Cape to-day is
one saying that the Boers are
j planting more guns in the hills
i surrounding Ladysmith.
All the correspondents in the
beleaguered town are safe, and
anxious to reopen communica
tion.
A gentleman who visited Nich

BIG COMBINE ABSORBS
THE UNION IRON WORKS
Gigantic Eastern Ship-Building Syndicate Or
ganized by the Seligmans Effects
the Deal.
Cramps' Yard, Philadelphia; Huntington's Plant, at Newport News;
Columbia Works, Baltimore, and the Works at Bath, Me.,
Also Join the Twenty Million Dollar Trust
A GIGANTIC syndicate, headed by
the Seligmans, is reaching out to
obtain ownership and control of
the leading shipbuilding concerns
of the United States. Intelligence
received by wire from Washing
ton, Philadelphia and New York leaves
no doubt that a vast combination has
been formed to control the building of
battle ships, armored cruisers and pro
tected gunboats, monitors and torpedo
craft designed for the United States
navy and also merchant vessels.
The feature of the news most interest
ing to San Francisco readers is the fact
that the combine contemplates the ab
sorption of the Union Iron Works. The
Call received the first hint of the big deal
(Jay before yesterday. Immediate inquiry
at the office of the Union Iron Works did
not then elicit clear confirmation of the
story. Additional inquiries subsequently
addressed to responsible parties in the
East brought the reply that the syndicate
had practically succeeded in combining
the shipyards of Cramp & Sons at Phila
delphia, C. P. Huntington of Newport
News, Va. ; the Columbia Iron Works.
Baltimore, the Bath (Me.) Iron Works
and the Union Iron Works, San Fran
cisco. It is highly probable that other
yard^ of minor importance are involved
In the general scheme and consolidation.
Early yesterday morning the local man
agers of the Union Iron Works were ad-

vised by wire of the proposed consollda
lion. The advices contained the announce
ment thai the agents of the syndicate de-
Bired that Henry T. Scott should be the
manager of the Union iron Works.
Yesterday [rving M. Scott was request
ed on behalf of The Call to supply de
tails of the negotiations, but he asked to
be excused from an interview on that
subject. He did not deny or discredit the
report, but advised that the facts for pub
lication be obtained elsewhere.
Some years cro the Sellgmans. who are
large owners of the stock of the Penn
sylvania road and the American Steam
ship Company, acquired a large if not
a controlling interest In the Cramps ship
building concern. In order to render the
investment remunerative i;i a hi^li degree,
Fteps have doubtless been taken to dull
the edge of competition in bids for Gov
ernment work. To accomplish this end a
consolidation of all the competing enter
prises was siiKgestod. When the recent
bids for the construction of cruisers were
published, the suspicion of a combine was
excited.
The absorption of the T'nlon Iron Works
by an Eastern syndicate will not l>e com
mended in San Francisco. As the work
of ship construction can be done cheaper
in the East than here, and as the ma
terials required for the building of a ship
can there be snppied at figures lower than
can be obtained in this city, the appre
hension comes that the Union Iron Works
will be the first of the great concerns to
suspend building operations when orders
slacken up.
It is estimated that the consolidated
value of the concerns admitted to the
combine exceeds twenty million dollars.
Figures of the capitalization are not
available. The value of the Cramps'
plant and general equipment approxi
mates seven million dollars. The Hunt
ington plant at Newport News is ac
counted to be worth five million dollars.
Last month there were 3600 men on the
payroll of the Union Iron Works. Last
Monday the company paid to employes on
account of the October roll $160,000.
The chief owners of the Union Jron
Works are Irving M. Scott, Henry T.
Scott and James 08. Gunn. James V.
Coleman in the settlement of the estate
of his mother became owner of some of
the stock and his two sisters, residing in
the East, also own stock of the works.
The popular notion that George Y/. Pres
cott is an owner of a large block Is said
to be incorrect. It is asserted on good
authority that the Southern Pacific
Company has no interest, either direct or
remote, in the Union Iron Works. The
ownership of the property Is represented
by ten thousand shares of stock. The
Seligmans could not have gained control
without the consent of the Scotts.
The Scotts may retire from the ship
building industry in San Francisco with a
sense of relief. In retirement they may
enjoy immunity from the. attacks of the
boodllng and vindictive press.
Irving M. Scott has lived In this city
thirty-nine years. His time has been
chiefly devoted to the upbuilding of a
great Industry, which affords employment
to thousands of men. Praise of his work
from all parts of the world has been ac
corded. The success has not been
achieved without the risk of great losses.
On every battleship constructed he ac
cepts a risk of $5,000,000. Few millionaires
are ready to take such chances. Most of
the rich men prefer safe investments In
real estate and Government bonds.
The Scotts have been shamefully har
assed and maligned. In the recent muni
cipal campaign the elements opposed to
Industrial progress were active in assail
ing the managers of the Union Iron
C. P. HUNTINQTON.
Works. The Scotts were charged with
employing scab labor and resorting to in
timidation to prevent the workmen from
voting as they desired. As a matter of
fact Irving M. Scott never sought to in
fluence his men as to how they should
vote. The only way the men could judge
of Mr. Scott's choice of candidates was to
ascertain his sentiments as proclaimed on
the stump.
No one connected with the management
of the Union Iron Works even thought i
of placing an Impediment in the path of
the men to the polls, yet a newspaper
concern which was purchased at auction
for $37,n00 impudently and arrogantly In
sisted that the 3500 men at the Union Iron
Works should each have two working
hours to vote. A demand was made that
the Scotts should stand the loss of 7000
hours. The demand was addressed to men
who in one month alone had disbursed the
sum of $160,000 to 3500 employes.
The case of the Scotts is only one of
many. Leading men, the builders of the
State, the promoters of prosperity, the
men who invest capital, brains and energy
in great enterprices for the betterment
of the city, are constantly assailed by j
vicious and irresponsible papers.
In August. 1888, when the Navy I>epa;t
ment Invited l>ids for the construction of
three cruisers and two gunboatsâ the first I
vessels of the new navyâ only five firms ;
responded, and of these one did not have '
the requisite facilities, and the contracts
went to the Columbia Iron Works at Bal
timore, Cramps at Philadelphia and the j
Union Iron Works in San Franrisco. i
These three yards practically constituted
the private shipyard facilities of the :
country for navy building, and not one of ,
the eight navy yards had the requisite I
plant to build. During the past thirteen j
years the number of private shipyards !
capable of doing navy work has increased i
to over twenty, and three <>f the navy j
yards have good shipbuilding plants, "if
the one hundred and odd vessels built
j or building since ISS6 only four were built
I in two navy yards: the others, including
fourteen battleships and armored cruis- 1
ers, were the product of private ship
yards fostered by a protective and liberal
i policy. In the early period there was a j
keen competition between the older estab- j
lished firms and the new firms, that were i
attracted by the high prices paid for navy j
work, and while the cost was high the |

Government got a fair value, the indus
tries attendant to ship and engine buiid
ing were developed, and the work was di
vided all over the country to big and
small yards. In 1895 the first disturbing
factor appeared with the Newport News
Company, which underbid the other yards
so greatly on the contract for two battle
ships as to indicate that an understand
ing between the several builders was ab
solutely necessary for their common good,
and subsequent bids tended to prove the
correctness of this belief, culminating a
year ago in the charge that the principal
shipyards had formed a trust for the pur
pose of regulating prices. The Newport
News. Bath Iron Works, Lewis Nixon
and the Union Iron Works were named as
constituting the trust, and while the of
ficials of the several firms indignantly de
nied the existence of such an organiza
tion the Navy Department nevertheless
took alarm and prepared to overcome any
attempt to gouge the Government. A fur
ther, almost positive, proof was furnished

a week ago. when the bids for six cruisers
were opened, and The Call pointed out the
suspicious fact that three of the bids
were so close to one another as to indicate
an understanding between the several
firms. These coincidental bids were as
follows: Bath Iron Works, $1,041,550;
Union Iron Works, $1,041,900. or only $250
higher than the Bath offer, and the bid of
Lewis Nixon. Elizabethport, was $1.039.%6,
or $1934 less than the highest tender. The
Columbia Iron Works', Baltimore, bid of
$1,116,000 was a fair price, but It was $74. 100
above the Union Iron Works, and exon
erates that firm from the suspicion of be
ing a member of the ring. The other bid
ders are hardly to be considered, as they
either lack the experience or the facili
ties, and will therefore not have any
standing with the Navy Department.
The news of the actual formation of a
shipbuilders' trust does therefore not
come as a surprise. In April last seven
shipbuilding tirms around the lakes in
corporated under the name of the "Ameri
can Shipbuilding Company," with a capi
talixation of $30,000,000. and on October 21
the company announced it had
i contracted to L>uild twenty-three
ate< 1 steamers and barges. of
139,100 gross tons, to cost about $6,902,
--000. Three llrms not in the trust will
two steamers to order and one to sell, and
it is clear that the combination will have
a great advantage over Individual build
ers. That a similar trust should be
formed among builders on the seaboard
is therefore quite natural. The ("ramp
yard is only such in name, as Charles
Cramp and his brother and other rela
tives are entrusted with the affairs of a
huge combined capital in which the Penn
sylvania Railroad, bankers and rolling
mills are largely represented. The Bath
Iron Works Is likewise an aggregation of
New England capital; the Newport News
is one of Collls P. Huntington's enter
prises, aided by foreign capital, and the
Union Iron Works firm of this city is like
wise composed of shipowners and others
with capital or influence, represented by
the Scotts. Th.-se four linns, which em
brace the largest in the country, would,
if combined, make It unprofitable for
smaller builders to compete, yet it is pos
sible that Lewis Nixon and the Columbia
Iron Works may be taken into the fold, as
the representatives of these firms have
great influence in Washington.
There is still another yard to be, which,
if it is not already enrolled in the combina
tion, would furnish a lively opposition
when ready for work. It is located at
Camden, and a vast amount of money is
being expended upon buildings, tools,
dock and piers. It is named the New
York Shipbuilding Company, has capital
to back It, experienced men to run it and
will begin early enough to bid on the bat
tle ships and armored cruisers to be con
tracted for next year.
This new trust is a serious matter for
independent builders, for they cannot
hope to compete for such work as the
combine wants. The workmen will be
less independent than heretofore, and
must be content with such compensation
as the trust may offer. The individual
power of each of these great firms has
been felt in the past; they have influenced
legislation, disapproved or sanctioned ap
pointments of bureau chiefs and sent ob
noxious Government inspectors to sea or
other duty, and now that they have com
bined, one agent at Washington will have
but little difficulty to bring about the con
summation of any wish or demand from
the trust.2

CHOATE TALKS OF
IRONCLAD FRIENDSHIP
EDINBURGH, Nov. 10. -Joseph Choate,
{).>â  United States ISmbassador, who was
the chief guest at the annual banquet of
th< '. r Scotl Club this evening, met
with a!) enthusiastic ovation. Sir Her
b< n Maxwell, who presided, made a
cordi.-'i r< ference to the friendship that
seals England and America.
In the course of a speech proposing the
toast to literature, Mr. Choate said:
"Truly your country and mine are con
d by bonds of sympathy that were
never stronger and closer than they are
at 'his very hour. I can assure you that
Lord Salisbury's generous and cordial
i words at the Lord Mayor's banquet yes
terday will meet with a quick and hearty
n;-i"ii!Hi beyond the Atlantic.
"It has been said !.y a great poet that
'peace hath her victories not less, re
nowned than war,' and this ironclad
friendship which now prevails between
! these two kindred nations is her latest
; and greatest victory. Jt means not
| merely between your country and mine,
but among all the greut nations of the
earth, and it tends by advancing civlliza
: t!on to promote the welfare of the whole
; human race."
The remainder of the much-applauded
; address was devoted to a humorous com
[parison between American and Scottish
: diameter, as illustrated In every-day life
i and to a eulogy <<f Sir Walter 8
Andrew Lang responded to the toast.
BIG GUNS THAT NOW
DOMINATE LADYSMITH
KSTC'OT'RT, Natal, Nov. 7.â The latest
news from Ladysmith is that the British
trumps are holding their own easily iind
making daily onslaughts on the enemy with
a flying 1 column of artillery and cavalry.
The position at Ladysmith appears to be
thus: The Boers are trusting to their big 'â 
guns to force a surrender, while General
White takes every chance of sallying
forth and hammering the enemy to pre
vent his getting neur. It is hardly likely
thai the Hoers will attempt to take Lady
smith by assault. The Boers' big guns
dominate Ladysmith from Mount Um
bulawane on the east and from points on
the north and northwest.
The object of the Boers is to silence
the British naval puns, which are being
mounted on the heights at the north 'if
the town. They have as yet inflicted but
little damage.
The Boers are reported to be not only
invesiing Ladynmith in great numbers,
but to be also in force near Colenso, and
to have long range Creusot guns- posted
on the hills covering the railway line
north and south. These guns are in
tended to dispute the advance of the Brit
ish forces for the relief of Ladysmith.
The British position will be better when
the Powerful guns, which are now on
their way, arrive here.

the first cannon shot the English thought
cur men were at the- railway station, and

"The ambulance, In accordance with
the usages, should have been three miles

cannot claim the English broke the
usages of civilized warfare, but I do not
think the English would have fired on

OFFICIAL COUNT OF THE VOTE
PROGRESSING IN KENTUCKY
No Matter What the Result May Be, the Courts
or the Legislature Will Have to Decide
a Contest.
GOVERNOR BRADLEY OF KENTUCKY.
LOUISVILLE, Ky., Nov. 10.â The offi
cial count of the ballots east on Tuesday
was begun to-day throughout the Stair.
In this city a Large crowd gathered at
the Courthouse to witness the count.
Representatives of all the parties were
admitted by the commissioners and the
examination of the ballots proceeded in
an orderly manner. Judging from the.
progress already made the official returns
will show !)o great variation from the
unofficial figures*, which give Louisville
and Jefferson County to the Republicans
by a plurality of about 8000.
There was no change- to-day in the
claims of the party managers. The Dem
ocrats assert that Goebc-1 will have a
plurality of 5000, while the nominee him
self places it at 700' J. The Republicans
claim that Taylor is elected by a plurality
Of (000. The Times (Ooebel Democrat)
has the following special from London,
Ky.:
"State Chairman A. W. Young of the
Democratic campaign committee is at
JiarbourHvUle, seeking to have the entire
vote of Knux County thrown out. Num
bers of affidavits alleging fraud and ir
regularities are being nled with the coun
ty board. It is believed Taylor's majority
will bt. considerably reduced it" the county
is Dot thrown out entirely.
"Official returns from Clay reduce Tay
lor's majority to 907. No changes have
tx â  :. made by the canvassing board uf
Laurel County so far. Taylors majority
will reinuin 931, though tin- Democrats
will iil<- atiidavits with the Stat.- Election
Board at Frankfort next Tuesday, asking
that three precincts be thrown out, which
will reduce It."
The Times has also the following from
Bardstown, Ky., concerning the count in
progress:
â¢A serious technical error In the vote
may increase Goebel's Nelson County ma
jority to LBB6. In the official count it was
discovered that in every precise! except
one \V. 1., instead of \V. s. Taylor, was
voted for, and the one precinct New
](. pe, giveÃ \v. _s. Taylor, the Republican
candidate, only 73, leaving the official vote
as certified to by the two Democratic
commissioners as follows: Goebel I9stf
iV. S. Taylor. 73; William I. Taylor, 1198!
The Republican commissioners refused to
certify to these figures."
Resorts received to-night by the
Courier-Journal from counties where the
official count was completed to-day show
in most cases Blighi changes from the
unofficial figures, in a few important In
stances, however, the changes favor the
Republicans Leslie County, in the
Eleventh District, Which was not in
cluded at all In the table las I night, which
gave Goebel a plurality of IÂ»71 in the State
is reported to-night as having given Tay
lor a plurality of %'2 votes on the official
count. The Kenton County â¢ liguiv-;
which in last night's table " gave 2493
plurality for Goebel, are reduced to about
2100. Oldham County gave Goebel a
plurality of M instead of 186, as reported
fast night. In a number of counties thera
were slight changes, each candidate
protiting.
Reports to the Commercial (R.) up t 0
midnight show gains of 561 for Qoebel and
86S for Taylor on changes from the tin
official returns. This leaves Taylors
plurality, according to the Commercial's
advices, /it 3641. Reports to this paper
from to-day's count cover sixty-eight of
the 119 counties in the State.
Feeling among the factions has bften ag
gravated rather than allayed by the de
velopments since Tuesday. Excited
meetings are being held in many parts of
the State to protest against frauds, which
H is alleged are contemplated, by the lead
ers. Nothing short of the official count
will determine the result, and it is a fore
gone conclusion that the result of that
count will simply change the scene of
conflict to the courts or the Legislature
where it will appear in the form of a
FRANKFORT, Ky., Nov. 10.â Tbe Dem
ocratic State Campaign Committee, with
a score of clerks, la busy to-night tabu

various county canvassing boards to-day
Several counties are still out, and of "a
number of those heard from to-day the
county boards will meet agaJn to-morrow
to pass on contested ballots, which may
materially affect the result. .The Demo
cratic committee clfilm that Goebel's vote
â wa-s slightly increased by the official
count in the counties to-day, and still
claim his election by at least 4000. Tin
committee decline* to give out the vote by
counties as received hy It, and on which
the claim of Goehel s election is .based, it
is conceded on all hand? here that the re
sult will not be definitely ascertained f nr
at least two days, and that no matter
which candidate may be elected, the Leg
islature will finally have to settle a con-.
test which is certain to be instituted for
possession of the office.
Buford Willitims, AY. Thompson and
Col^man Carr, prominent Democrats
have been arrested by Deputy United
States Marshal McCarthy, on warrants
charging intimidation of colored voters on

Court, and It is understood that probably
a hundred more will be issued.

Union to-day issued its last bulletin on
the Kentucky election, saying that with

WARSHIPS TO PREVENT
ESCAPE BY SEA
WASHINGTON, Nov. 10. -Great Interest
is felt at the War Department over
Agulnaldo's sudden change of base north
i.tstward from Tarlac to Bayombon,
about sixteen miles distant. There are
numerous spellings of the latter place, but
: regoing one is the one generally ad
hered to on the maps in the possession
of the War Department. The most inter
â¢ feature of the new situation is that
Aguinaldo has been forced out of the
Tarlac country into a region to the north
where the Tag.Uo is not spoken, and
where the mountains are tilled with Ne
gritas and other savage tribes, who are
:'.ii!;il.is. Thia is about the
most mountainous and inaccessible pu.rt
of the Island.
To the south base of Carabello Moun
tain there is a narrow break in the moun
tain range, and within a few miles around
the base of Carabello Mountain, on its
northern Blope, one strikes the bead
quarters of the MoffOl. which is t>
ginning of the great river Cayugan that
- northward 250 mfli s into the China
It is on the headwaters of the Mbgol
that Aguinaldo is now located. The way
;= open for him down the long stretch of
the river to Aparri at the mouth of the
Cayugan, where it flows into the sea. This
is one of the wildest but richest valleys
in the island. It is believed that the rivi-r
can is navigable for our tlnclad
l.oats ISO miles from its mouth, ajid for
much farther.
expected as soon as Apulnaldo
â shows any disposition to move down the
I valley toward the. China Sea, that war-
p ships and punboats will he sent round the
I northern end of the island to meet him
and cut off his escape.
If it is his intention to escape from
lAizon, he would naturally seek Aparri or
some northern port, but the country
around Carabello Mountain is such that
he could probably stand off the whole
American force In a game of hide and
seek in the hills for the greater part of
the romlncr season.
Secretary Root feels no concern over the
transfer of Aerulnaldo's base of operations
to Bayomhansr. The Secretaary said to
day the movement was distinctly retro
grade and In the nature of a retreat on
finding that his former base was unten
able. Throughout the War Department
the view prevails that Agulnaldo's move
does not materially chance the campaign
plans?, and that these will be pushed with
unabated vigor.
NEGLIGENT OFFICERS
WILL BE PUNISHED
KANSAS CITY, Nov. 10.â A Star special
from Washington, says: The rrport of the
!' ird of Survey that investigated com
plaints of overcrowding on the transport
Tartar, which brought the Twentieth
Kansas Regiment, Genera] Funston and
many sick soldiers home from Manila,
has been received at the War Department
from General Shaffer at San Francisco.
The Secretary of War has issued an nrler
against the report being made public and
has announced a positive policy against
the publication of confidential r- 1
conducted by officers of the army. From
a high War Department official it was
learned to-day that the Secretary of War
will be very prompt to punish atiy officer
of the army who. through neglect or in
efficiency, fails to properly provide for the
troops under his command. It is learned
that th<- report on the Tartar case criti
cizes the transporting of so many siok
era on a transport which had accom
modations for only twenty-six emergency
sick. It is said at the War Department
that it was the duty of the regiment sur
geon to leave in the Manila hospitals
those men of the Twentieth Kansas who
were 111 and not to have placed therrT on
the Tartar, as was done, but it is added
it is not likely that any action will be
taken, as the surgeon of the Twentieth
Kansas and all of its officers have been
mustered out of Fervice.
PHILIPPINES ARE NOT
RICH IN MINERALS
WASHINGTON, Nov. 10.â In a report to
the Interior Department on the geology of
the Philippine [slands Mr. Becker of'the
Geological Survey gives some interesting
Inl rmation regarding the mineral re-
Bources of the group. Mr. Recker says
that while gold exists in both Luzon and
Mindanao it is comparable rather to that
â¢â f the <~'arolinas and Virginia thah to the
Western gold fields of the United States,
and a rush to the Philippine fields he
predicts, would result in disappointment.
The r. port s;iys:
The copper deposit* of pa nto seem rich
and extensive, but very expensive roads will
be needed to render them available. The high
quality of some of the Iron ores of Luzon is
beyond question, but the lignite of the islands
is not adapted to iron smelting. The so-called
coal is a Rood lignite, its heating effect is
from two-thirds to three-quarters of that of th*
best Pteamine coal. There are great quanti
ties of this fuel, and much of It could be de
livered at a profit on vessels at $2 50 Mexi
can per ton.
Much Mail Undelivered.
WASHINGTON, .Nov. 10.â Postmaster
General Smith has been notified by Di
rector of Posts Valle. at Manila, that
large numbers of circular letters from
businoss companies in the States .'ire be
inK addressed to thr- Philippine Provinces,
and that under present conditions it is .1
waste of time and money to .send mail for
points outside nf Manila, Cavite, Hollo,
Cebu, Jolo and Negxos Islands.
Condemned Men May Be Spared.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 10.â The four sol
diers who were sentenced to death at Ma
nila now stand an excellent chance to
save their lives. Circumstances have
been discovered in the proceedings of the
court-martial which will require correc
tion in the. first Instance at Manila, if.

tence entailed.

TON HOTEL. WASHINGTON, Nov. 10.-
Secretary Hay is determined to obtain
written assurance from the powers pos-
B -.-sing spheres of influence in <.'hina
for the preservation of American rights
without assistance from other Govern
ments. The move he has made is distinct
ively American and it was to make this
plain to the world as well as to receive
a promise In black and white from Great
Britain that that Government, as well
as those of Europe, was Included in the
identical note in relation to China.
Though Japan is expected to follow the
American lead and to this extent her ac
tion will be acceptable to the United
States, the authorities are satisfied that
the powers possessing certain zones in
the Celestial empire will ultimately com
ply with the Secretary's request.
The Secretary does not believe that he
will receive the answers under two
weeks, but this will be in ample time
for the President to Incorporate the re
sult sf the American representations in
his message to Congress. The belief of
the administration that the Governments
approached will give the written assur
ances, however much they may hesitate,
is based upon the understanding that
such Governments do not care to have
the United States make any further an
nouncement which may be more advanced
in character of its intentions in China.
It was jointed out to me to-day that
such assurances will be of little future
injury to the powers making them, as in

Variety Show Burned Out.
BAKERSFIELD, Nov. 10.â There .is
desolation in the heart of the tenderloin.
Frank Carrillo's variety show is in ashes.
It was burned at 7 o'clock this morning
and nothing was saved but a nickel-in

artists lost all their finery. The total
loss of the contents of the show is es
timated at $2500; insurance, $1125. The

case they propose to formally annex the
territory comprised In the spheres of in
fluence they hold this Government could
make no objections unless Its rights
should be involved.
As an illustration, the official with
whom I lalked pointed to the action of
France with respect to Madagascar.
France claimed a protectorate over the
Island and the United States insisted that
its commerce should be respected, not un
der the terms of French treaties, but
under the American convention with the
Madagascar Government. The Frer.ch
Government finally declared the island a
French colony and American commerce
then had to undergo French exactions.
So with China. While the powers hav
ing spheres of influence in China do not
enjoy protectorates over them, it Is said
that the Madagascar precedent will
doubtless apply to them in case of an
nexation.
The authorities understand that the
Russian, as well as the German Govern
ment, has received the American repre
sentation in a kindly spirit and that its
answer will be favorable, but Great Rrit

Special rMspatch to The Call.
SAN QT'ENTTN PRISON. Nov. in.â
Convict Joseph F. Ross, doing nine years'
time, from Merced County, for murder,
would not under ordinary circumstances
be given his freedom until January 1. 1901,
but it Is highly probable that as a reward
for his ingenuity as an inventor he will
be paroled at to-morrow's session of the
Board of State Prison Directors. The in

It was found to work perfectly, thereby
insuring a decrease of $.Wi a year in the
expense of running the mill and the sav
ing of $SOOO In a lump sum by the repaJr of
20,000 flyers cast aside as useless in the
last ten years.
Th r :re afo twenty-six spinning frames in
use in the jute mill, on each of which are
used 12S cast steel flyers. Each year the
tips of 2000 of these flyers are worn so
badly by the friction of twine, that they
are thrown aside; 20,000 of them are now
ornamenting a corner of the big building.
EA'ery flyer costs 3S cents.
Ross has been at work trying to dis
cover a proces? for repairing the flyers for
months, and his labor was rewarded a
few days ago by finding a process by
which the flyers can be retipped and made
as good as new.
A convict named Arthur, whose voca
tion was that of a blacksmith, was ac
quainted with the process, and has grown
so expert in welding on new tips that a
whole frame of tue repaired flyers was
tested to-day and found to work to per
fection. When the 20,000 flyers are all re
tipped, counting their cost at 38 cents
apiece, $7t>oo will have been saved. In ad

Invented a new flyer considerably lighter
than the old one, which requires 2b per
cent less power to operate, and by tnis
invention the prison will be saved an an
nual expense of $5000. "Ross has always
been an exemplary prisoner," said War
den Aguirre to-day, and the story lately
printed that he tried to burn down the
prison was a raw fake. The man has well
earned a pardon."
MURDERS HIS WIFE
IN VIEW OF A CROWD
Proprietor of an Allentown (Pa.)
Hotel Then Ends His Own
Life.
ALLENTOWN, Pa.. Nov. 10.â George
W. Kern, proprietor of a hotel, shot him
self and wife to-day. The couple had not
been living together. To-day Mrs. Kern
had boarded a street car, and her husband
followed and stood on the rear platform,
displaying a revolver. She ran from the
car pcrouming and sought the protection
of about 200 wire mill employes, who had
just finished work on the night shift.
Kern hastened after lir-r and dragged her
into his hotel, barricaded the door with a
chair, and in full view of the crowd shot
her dead. He ran into another room and
there killed himself.
Kern was 3S yean old and his wife 29.
GUNNER ARRESTED.

struction.
Will Test the Law.
MADKRA, Nov. 10.â A suit has been
filed In the Superior Court here by James
E. Nugent, editor and proprietor of the
Times, to test the validity of the section
of the county government act forbidding
newspapers established less than a year
from doing county work. The Supervis
ors passed all the claims of the Times,
but the auditor refuses to draw a war
rant for the amount. Plaintiff asks for
a writ of mandamus compelling the Audi
tor to issue the warrant and the writ is
made returnable November 14.
It is understood here that Lord Paunce
fote's chief mission. In pursuance of the
desire of his Government to cultivate
friendlier relations with the United
States, will be to enter upon negotiations
with Secretary Ha.y for the permanent
settlement of the Alaskan boundary ques
tion. Of course, his duty will also re
quire him to discuss China, an it will
other pending questions, but Embassador
Choate has made the representations in
regard to the wishes of Secretary Hay
with respect to trade In China, and the
reply is expected to be handed to him.
When the Alaskan boundary question Is
disposed of Lord Pauncefote will also take
up the question of abrogation of the Clay
ton-Bulwer treaty and the reassembling
of the high joint commission, which will
settle all pending questions with Canada.
Lord Pauncefote is very much gratified
at the settlement of the Samoan question,
and he feels that all the three Govern
ments have reason to be satisfied with
the arrangements. In the first place, the
T'nited States has acquired what is con
sidered the best harbor in the South Seas,
Germany has satisfied popular sentiment
at home and furthered the ambition of
the Emperor in the matter of securing
outlying territory so as to bring about the
authorization of a large navy by remain
ing in Upolu and Savaii. and, finally,
Great Britain has scoured adequate com
pensation, besides reached an agreement
with respect to African questions which
makes certain an attitude of strict neu
trality nn the part of Germany in the
Transvaal.
UPROAR IN THE
FRENCH SENATE
Hearingr of Conspiracy
Cases Interrupted.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PARIS, Nov. 10.â The Senate, sitting as
a high court, resumed to-day, calling the
games of witnesses in the conspiracy
cases, which led to violent scenes. Presi
dent Fallieries vainly tried to preserve
silence, and some "t' the witnesses had
to I" 1 removed by the ushers. When M.
Monteil's name was called the tumult tn
creased. Thi re were loud cries of "Vive
Guerin," "Vive Deroulede," "Alias los
Juifes, while from outside the Senate
could be heard the strains of the "Mar
seillaise."
A witness who thundered "Vive Derou
lede," "Vive l'armee," was arrested amid
the protests of the other witnesses. Final
ly partial order was restored and. the per
sons arrested were released.
M. Fallieries then read the conclusions
of counsel, who held that the Senate was
incompetent t" hear the case.
The session was afterward .suspended.
During the suspension of the sitting a
newspaper vender named Rimbart. one of
M. (Juerin's adherents, violently assaulted
another witness, whom he accused of be-
In*; a police agent.
The Municipal Guards seized Rimbart,
who drew a revolver. He was incar
cerated.
The Senate resumed the session during
the evening and heard further the argu
ments of defending counsel, who submit
ted that the Senate is incompetent to try
the conspiracy case. The Senate ..hen
adjourned.

anti-Quay newspaper, five men. all resi

ing fraudulent returns. The defendants
are John F. Sheehan, R. M. Drinkert.
William Cook. Harr McCabe and George
Kirkland. All but one are said to be in

several prominent Republican politicians
in this city and a lieutenant from the
Capitol police at Washington.
The fraud is alleged to have b^en ac
complished in the Thirteenth Division of
the Seventh Ward, and the election pa
pers of this division were produced as ev
idence. The returns showed a vote of 337
for James K. Barnett, the Republican
candidate for State Treasurer, and five
for William T. Creasy, the Democratic
candidate.
Kirkland, who at the time of his arrest
said his name was George Wright, de
scribed the trip from Washington to this
city of the alleged repeaters on Monday
night. On Tuesday morning, he said, he
and William H. Cook went to the house
of Deputy Coroner Samuel Salter, accom
panied by Lieutenant Joseph G. Rmlgors
of the Capitol police. Lieutenant Rodgers,

round draw nighl at. the Broadway
Athletic Hub. Sullivan outfought Bern
stein. He led, forced aÂ»<i landed, while
the other man backed and remained on
the defensive during the; majority of the
rounds. Left jabs from Bernstein cut and
bled Sullivan early in the light. At? the
end of the sixth round Sullivan's face was
covered with blood. Hi.Â« nose and mouth
â were bleeding, and each time Bernstein 8
left hand' reached his face the glove was
besmeared with blood ur.d the Irish lad's
countenance was : made more repulsive.
Dave sent right and left to the body and
kept Berr.steln guessing with right and
left swing-s to the head.
In the tenth round Bernstein's left did
some wonderful . work, visiting Dave's
face and body frequently, the Irishman
returning, with hard lefts, which landed
on the stomach and over the heart. Up
to the nineteenth round the Heist was
fairly even, but in this round Bernstein
sent his right over to the mark and Dave
went to his corner groggy.
Dave' came- out strong in the Twentieth,
however, and forced the .-In Ing with re
newed enerpry. He drove Bernstein all
over the rlnsr.with left to head ami right
and left on the wind, to which Bernstein
countered feebly. This lasted until the

Both these men. however, are expected
to start in tho game. The work of the

The principal fault has been a lack of ag

CHINESE FRUIT
PICKERS MOBBED
White Men Resent Their
Importation.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
VISAIJA, Nov. 10.â White laborers In
and around Lindsay have determined to
put a stop to Chinese labor in that sec
tion of the State. Several meetings have
been held recently and bitter invectives
hurled at the Mongolians. To-day was
lixpil ;;.s tho thup fur action and the fruit
pickers, instead of going to work as usual,
mbled in a body and drove a gang
of Chinese which had just arrived back
to the station.
The excitement was Intense and at
times bloodshed swined imminent. Sticks,
stones and other missiles were freely
used and the frightened Celestials rushed
back to the railroad with the mob of
white men at their heels. The protec
tion offered by the station-house and
empty cars was readily accepted and they
huddled close together until the mob
i finally dispersed.
The Chinese were brought to Lindsay
by ranch owners who fear serious injury
t'i their orange crops owing to the scar
city of laborers. They claim that no
worthy applicant has ever been turned
away and that good wages are paid.
I Sooner than suffer financial loss they
brought In a trainload of Chinese. This
exasperated the white men and led to the
riot. Peeling runs very high and if an
attempt is made to put the Celestials to
i work further trouble may follow.

MARCATO IS
A FINISHED
MUD RUNNER
Scores His Third Victory in
a Like Number of Days.
Tanforan Results.
Marcato, the brown Duke of MontrosÂ©
gelding, owned by P. Ryan, seems to be
a very useful piece of racing bric-a-brac,
lie won a race on Wednesday, repeated
the trick on Thursday, and yesterday
made it three in a row. Fortunately none
of his contests were hard ones. In yes
terday's mile run he reigned a pro
nounced favorite in the betting and was
aided from the start, for Faversham, the
contender, was left at the post, though no
fault could be attached to Caldwell.
Ryan's horse galloped home six lengths
ahead of Ix>destar. Croker, heavily
played for the place, proved a very poor
investment.
The fields were again very light and
the track in sloppy condition. Under these
conditions three favorites only were able
to make *he wire In front.
Corrlg-an's filly, Sardine, made a big
gallop of the opening event, a sprint for
two-year-olds. She ruled a 4 to 5 choice
and led Dmmcd out easing up. Kitty
Kelly ran third.
Corrigan's filly, St. Agnes, also had a
strong call in the betting <>n the half-mile
spin for two-year-olds, the early 2 to 5
being snapped at. She developed a streak
â¢if yellow aftor leading into the stretch
and was beaten bands down by the 10 to
1 shot Jolly Briton, with Johnny Ranch
up. Miss Sophie was a close third.
Tommy Burns had the leg up on Ostler
Joe and on paper the black horse looked
a "moral.'' Going to the post a 7 to 10
chance over his company, he ran with
his mouth open to the stretch and there
closed it. Reolia, at 8 and 10 to 1, passed
him as If he were tied, winning cleverly
by a couple of lengths. Frank Jaubert,
which ran a whole lot like a "sucker
horse." was third.
JVrhaps after the finish in the fifth
number, the mile run, little J. Walsh will
forget to "rubber" so much at the horses
behind him. He sat astride Silver Tone,
the heaviest played of the trio starting,
and aftor striking the stretch with a fair
li ad made himself at home. He made
grlm.iiv* at the paddock, tried two or
three different styles of wraps, practiced
an English "roll," didn't think so much
of. Tommy Burns' Beat or finishing' pow

HOW BALZAC WROTE.
The Great Frenchman Was the Terror
of Compositors.
With an inborn literary facility, with an
inborn artistic conscience that drove him
on in untiring pursuit of perfection, he
tilled the vast chasm between his thought
and its expression with countless pen
strokes, and by methods of composition
all his own; the exact reverse of those
of Dumas, writing at white heat, never
rewriting; or of Hugo, who said. "I know
not the art of soldering a beauty in the
place of a defect, and T correct myself in
another work." Balzac began with a
short and sketchy and slipshod skeleton,
making no attempt toward sequence or
style, and sent it, with all its errors, to
the printer. Proofs were returned to him
in small sections pasted in the center of
huge sheets, around whose wide borders
soon shot from the central text rockfis
and siiuilis of the author's additions and
corrections. Bred by his infuriated fist.
The new proofs cam.- back on similar
sheets, to be returned to the printer, aga;n
like the web and tracks of a tipsy spider.
This was repeated a dozen or. it is s. i !.
a score of times, always with amplifica
tions, until his typesetters became palsied
lunatic-. He overheard one of them, as
he rntcred the offlc* one day, say: "I've
done my hour of Balzac; who takes him
next?" Typesetter, publisher, author
were put out of misery only when the last
proof came in, at its foot the magic "Bon
a tirer."
This stupendous work had been preced
ed and was accompanied by as stupendous
preparation of details. He dug deep to
set the s*>Hd foundations for each struc
Cast.
RULED OFF
THE TURF
FOR LIFE
Fate of Curley Brown and
Others Implicated in the
Newport Fight.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CINCINNATI, Nov. 10.â After Â«

tween CurJey Brown and Dan Murray
Thursday afternoon at Newport track,
the judges to-day ruled off the turf for
life the following persons: H. D. Brown.
George Keating, Trainer Ted Wilker and
Charles Keating. AVilker was implicated
in the affair through handing Brown a pair
of brass knuckles during the affray. It
developed, however, that Brown did not
use the weapon given him by Wilker. but
Wilker struck Murray several times
across the head with a chair. The Keat
ing brothers, according to evidence pre
sented, were in the room in which the
light took place and prevented Murray
escaping his assailants when attacked by
Brown. Both Keatings have been em
ployed by Starter Jacub Holtman as flag
men.
Brown is one of the best-known turfmen
in America. For several years he was
stnrter at Newport and several other
tracks. This year lie has been racing a

ture he meant to build. "I have had to
read so many books," he says, referring
to his preliminary toil on "Louis Lam
bert." So real were his creations to him
âmore alive to his vision than visible
creatures aboutâ that he must needs nume
them fittingly, and house them
priately. Invented nomenclature gave
no vitality to them, in his view, and he
hunted, on signs and shop fronts wherever
he went, for real names that meant life,
and a special life. "A name." as he said,
"which explains and pictures and pro

could not possibly belong to any other."

Cameras in Church.
A clergyman in England is advocating
the use of a concealed camera in the pul
pit, which could be Bnapped with a
ton, unknown to the congregation. This
Innovation, he thinks, would prevent
much of the snoozing in church, as the
â¢a would take a picture of the con
gregation, and the sleeping ones would
be caught Then, he says, by Bh
these photogranhs to the backsliding
they would become bo shamed that

Special EHipateh to The Call.
CHICAGO, Nov. 10.â Frank A. Vander
llp. Assistant Secretary of the United
States Treasury. who arrived in Chicago
to-day for a week's visit with his family,
says that the Treasury Deportment has
no Intention, of buying $100,000,000 of bonds
for the relief of the money stringency felt
by stock speculators In New York, and
that there has been no organized demand
upon the department for such form of as
sistance. He says if the stringency were
due to other causes than stock speculation
and manipulation of interest rates in the
Stock Exchange pome measures of relief
might be considered.
"Ii is true that money Is ti^ht in New
York," said Mr. Vanderlip, "'call loans
tiding made at from 20 to So per cent, but
the situation 1? not BO serious a,< has been
reported. The discussion over the advisa

bond's has been theoretical, for the de
partment Is not going to make any such
purchase. It might at some time In the
future, for we now have a cash balance
of over $29C1,uÂ»,000.
"Nothing can be done now to ease the
money market except to deposit the inter
nal revenue receipts with the national
banks, but ere is little probability of
that kind of action being taken, for we
have $83,000,000 in deposits subject to call.
"The stringency complained of in New
York is felt more in stock speculation
than elsewhere, and tbx> money market ie
manipulated more or less on the Stock
Exchange. Persons borrow SoM.OOO at a
high rate and then say they don't want
the money, but are willing to pay the in
terest.
"As a consequence of this practice a
large amount of money is locked up,
merely for the purpose of preventing
others from using it. The Treasury De
partment recognizes the situation in New
York, but ii is not going to help out the
speculative element of that city by pur
chasing bonds. If we thought the strin
gency was due entirely to other causes
there might b<* some measures considered

is now virtually a civil governor as well
as a military governor. General Wood,
If he should be made the head of the
government in Cuba, would be, as I un
derstand the scheme, denominated civil
governor, but he would not be divested
either of his military rank or of military
authority and power. A military force
would remain In the island and would
necessarily â or, at least, almost certainly
â be subject to the supreme head, the
civil governor. It has been our constant
aim and practice to subordinate the mlli
iavy to the civil as much as possible.
"Hence i should not regard the change
stated to be proposed as a long step
toward the establishment of a purely na
tive government, I lowed by the abso
lute withdrawal of the United States from
nil active participation in the direction of
Cuban affairs, The paramount obligation
â which rests upon the Government of the
I'nlted Statesâ to itself, to Cuba and to
the worldâ is to see rhat â  here exist peace
and order and protection to the lives and
property of all. With this obligation fully
Assured, as I believe it to be, the step
suggested as about to be taken cannot
be interpreted as abridging in any great
fipgree tno period to elapse before the,
Cubans are fully intrusted with their own
destiny."

STINGY GIRL
Saves Her New Shoes by Only Wear-
ing One at a Time.
It will bo many a long day before Hyde
Park will cease wonderingâ Hyde Park In
this instance moaning the young women
of that South Side Districtâ and tho thing
over which their minds are pondering is
the old query: "Weil, what next?"
It all came out through a burst of con
fidence on the part of a young woman
who has long heldâ not to say enjoyedâ
â â¢â¢â  reputation of being probably the
stingiest girl in Chicago, It has been
common gossip for years that when In the
parks she always walks on the grass to
save wearing out her shoes on the gravel
walks. She never has been known to "set
up" the ice cream sodas on a hot day, and
a well authenticated story is current to
the effect that on one occasion, when two
young women called on her she brought
In a fine large apple and divided it be
tween them, paying she did not care for
any, but telling them at the same time
that her father had just sent home a bar
rel of the apples.
But her crowning achievement in petty
saving probably never would have been
known did she not take pride in her penu
rlousness for she is at liberty to spend
her father's abundant wealth as freely as
she will. , Â
"Do you know girls, she, said when her
conlid'lng mood came upon her, "I have
the greatest scheme on earth for saving
shoes
Every one of them thought Immediately
of her "plan of avoiding gravel walks, ami
expected .to hear an old story. But It
was different.
"For two years now," she went on, I
have never worn shoes that were mates
except to dancing parties. You see,
there's really no reason why one should
have on two good shoes at once any
where but at a dance. , When I buy a pair
I put one away and wear the other with
an old one. When ] sit down 1 am al
ways careful not to let the old one show,
but put the new one out where it can be
seen. When the first new one gets old I
discard the one of the older pair and put
on the other new one, then keep that foot
in front. Of course, then 1 am wearing
both shoes of the fame pair, but they're
not mates any more. Now, Isn't that a
great scheme?"
There was a wild and concerted strug
gle on the part of a half dozen girls to
recover breath and composure at the
same time, so they could tell her they
thought it was a "great scheme." Cer
tainly, it wouldn't do to tell her other
wise. Hadn't they long ago been called
on* to approve her plan of laying away
soiled winter gloves to wear out in sum
mer, when one's gloves aren't supposed
to look so fresh?
And now they are all asking each other
"What next?" and the old maxim about
"nutting your best foot forward" has new
meaning for them.â Chicago Tribune.

WIFE-MURDERER
BECKER HANGED
Awful Crime Avenged
by the Law.
Special Dispatch to ThÂ« Call.
CHICAGO, Nov. Albert August
Becker, who on January 27 last murdered
his wife, Rachel, and afterward chopped
up and boiled the remains In order to dis- \
pose of them, was hanged In the County i
â¢ Jail at 12:05 this afternoon. Becker's nock '
was not broken by the fall, and It was j
sixteen minutes before he was pronounced
dead. H^S
On the scaffold Becker protested his in
nocence, and declared that George Sut- i
teriin, the father of his second wife, was !
the real murderer.
The case of August Becker In many
ways bore a remarkable similarity to that |
of Adolph Luetgert. Both of the con
demned men were butchers, and the mo
tive for the crime was the same In both
casesâ the desire to get rid of the wife '
I in order to marry a younger woman. The
i manner of committing the crimes was
1 much the same, both men. according to j
j the testimony, being extremely brutal in |
I the killing, and both using the Fame ,
I means to dispose of the bodyâ by boiling ',
| and burning.
It was proved at Becker's trial that af
i ter killing bis wife lie had chopped
her body to pieces, then boiled the re
mains on his kitchen stove, afterward
| burning the remains in various places. As
! In the case of Luetgert, the rings of the
j murdered wife played no small part In the
testimony leading to conviction. Like I
Luetgert. also. Becker endeavored to ex- |
plain his wife's disappearance by saying
she had eloped with another man.
Becker made several confessions. In
' his first statement he said he had
1 drowned his wife In Lake Michigan.
: Later he endeavored to Implicate in tho ;
: crime the father of the woman whom he i
married after murdering his first wife, j
; and to the la.st he adhered to this version. '
LEGAL SLAVERY IN THE SOUTH.
Services of Negroes Fined for Small
Crimes Are Sold to Fanners.
Conditions much like slavery have been
brought about among the negroes In this
State by the fine-alternative system of
j punishing minor crimes, and the grand
j Jury of this (Anderson) county. In Its
presentment Just made, directs attention
; to them.
A negro Is arrested for Home offenseâ
| gambling, fighting, resistance of officers,
breach of contract, violation of the Hen
I law, selling liquor, or any one of a dozen
other misdemeanors. lie is fined $25 or
$T.O, with thÂ« alternative of working sixty j
or ninety days, or even six months, on
! the chain gang. Then a white farmer
calls and looks him over. If he appears
ito be an able-bodied farm hand, the
farmer offers to pay his fine, to be
"worked out," and the negro usually con- j
Bents. As farm wages are from $6 to $8
a month and board, and in such cases are
i fixed at the lowest rate, the negro's
I chances for working himself out of servi- ,
I tude in a year or two are slim. He does i
: not dare to violate his contract. If ho
has a family, he cannot set away, and
even if he is a single man he cannot go
far before he is captured, and breach of
contract means another lons term on "tne
gang."
The gand jury In its report says: "There
are In the county to-day a number of
these unfortunates who, under a terror of (
conviction for crimes ranging from the
most trivial of which the law takes notice
to graver offenses, have bound them
selves to landlords for a period of service
ranging all the way from one year to rive
or more, having in some instances thiefl
or four years' service for the advance
: ment of a fee of $50 or less. Worse than
! all, â¢ any worthless negro men. who have
: neglected their wives and helpless cMI- i
| dren and have got Into the clutches of ,
the law, have bound those wives and chil
â  dren to a state of servitude to procure
the payment of some small fine. We are
I told that in some instances children
â  scarcely out of their infancy have been ;
thus bound out. sometimes during the
whole of their minority, in order to pay
a fine of a few dollars, the price of their
father's crimes. In other Instances these
contracts are obtained In order to avoid
prosecution."
The presentment names one lawyer of
the local bar, who. it charges, regularly
visits the County Jail and offers his ser
vices to friendless negro prisoners, his
fees to be "worked out." With the men
! once bound to him. he can let them out
to farmers to "work out" what they owe
1 him, presumably making a profit on the
transaction. Whether convicted or ac
quitted, the prisoners are in equally bad
case, the term of their servitude depend-
Ing on the conscience of the landlord.
I The Improvidence and ignorance of the
negroes make it easy to hold them In
-1 definitely with small advances of pro
visions and clothing at tremendous prices,
and Interest charges on the money, the
stem expressed in the familiar lines:
Ort'6 er ort an' Uppers er fl::p-r;
All fur d<? white man; none Cur de nigger.
The grand jury makes no recommenda
: tion except to suggest that it would be
more merciful to punish offenders with
an absolute sentence of Imprisonment or
I labor on "the gang," that they might
serve out and be done with.â Anderson
(S C.) Correspondent New York Tribune.
WHITEWASHERS' TRUST.
Colored Kalsominers Have Caught
the Craae for Combines.
Baltimore whltewashers are about to
form a combination for the regulation of
th'-ir business, and for the purpose of pre
venting price cutting. Colored men who
have been engaged in the business for
years have been alarmed over novices,
r.ter into competition with them and
h. i ure jobs by using Inferior materials
ai d 'heap workmen. This they say re
â¢Â« â  ni the end upon the trade in gen
eral, and their object is to uphold their
I â  ifession by throwing around it safe
guards which they claim will be as mucn
for the benefit of their customers as for
themselves.
When it Is remembered that there are
about 87,000 buildings in Baltimore it will
!..> seen what a formidable affaJr a white
washers' trust would become, and how
its workings would be brought home to
nearly every family in the city. Scarcely
a single one of these buildings but needs
a coat of whitewash for some part of it
or its surroundings at least once or per
haps twice a year. There is some talk
of having the State regulate the business,
probably by having a State Board of Ex
aminers, who would Inquire into the qual
iilcations of whitewashes by competitive
examinations. It has been suggested that
the examinations might be arranged to
take place at some State institution
where a section of fence or building
mlpht be alloted to each applicant for a
practical evidence of his ability. Another
plan suggested is to license whitewashes.
Then, it is said, the men would be regis
tered and could be kept under surveil
lance. â Baltimore Run.
FAITHFUL DOG.
Saved the Lives of a Family, but He
Perished.
Had It not been for the warning bark
of a faithful dog the family of Thomas
Clay, of Kipp street and Indiana avenue,
would In all likelihood have been smoth
ered to death recently. Mr. Clay keeps a
saloon at the above address, and in some
unknown manner a lire broke out in the
cellar. â¢
The (lop was penned up in the rear of
the cellar, and the bright glare' of the
kindling flames caused him to bark and
howl furiously. The noise awakened Clay
and the other members of his family, who
were all asleep. They soon found out
what the matter was, and hurriedly
dressed themselves. t
The dog's warning came none too soon
for by the time they reached the lirst
floor the house was tilled with smoke. In
the meantime an alarm was turned in by
a Thirtieth District policeman. The fire
men succeeded in extinguishing the
flames, with a damage of $1000, equally
divided between the building and con
tents.
When the firemen had forced their way
through the lire and smoke into the cel
lar they found the dog dead. In their
hurry to get out of the house the family
had forgot the faithful animal that gave
them timely warning.â Philadelphia Times.

WAR-TIME STORY.
Recalled by a Visit of Admiral Wat-
son to Chicago.
A pretty war-time story developed In
Chicago recently through the presence In
the city at the same time of Admiral Wat
son, who was passing through on his way
to relieve Admiral Dewey, and Mrs. Ed
win A. Clarke of Qulncy, in., who was
here visiting her son, Kdwln B. Clarke,
the Chicago architect It was a story
of tho war of secession ;m<i not of tho
Spanish war, bui the occurrence of a for
eign conflict in the meantime does not dim
the story's Inten
Admiral Watson's friendship for Mrs.
Clarke dates from the time when he was
Â£* midshipman with Admiral Farragut's
fleet befor.- New I Orleans, and when she
was a Miss Besancon, a Southern belle,
and the strongest kind of a sympathizer
with the secession cause.
Miss Besancon was on her father's plan
tation in a suburb of the city. A part of
the Federal army of occupation camped
near tho piao\ The soldiers needed tire
wood, and set out to get It. On the Hesan
oon plantation were some magnificent
oaks, centuries old, the pride of the place
and of the family. Tho wood-cutting
party saw thÂ» oaks, and with axes in
hand started for them.
On the plantation with Miss Besancon
were her sister, two cousins and two vis
iting friends, all young women. From a
window they saw the ax party approach
the group of great oaks. Then there was
a race. When the soldiers arrived at the
first tree they found six pretty girls in
white with hands joined encircling and
clapping the old gray trunk.
It was a c:tse of "Soldier, spare this
tree," but the men wanted wood. They
made for another oak, but again were
outstripped in the race, and that tree, in
Its turn, was clasped in the arms of six
plucky Southern girls. A third tree was
circled In the same manner, and then the
Northern invaders shamefacedly with
drew and secured their fuel supply else
where.
This tree-saving episode reached the
ears of the officers of the army of occu
pation and of those of the fleet. They
called In scores to offer their congratula
tionss to the plucky plantation girls.
Among the callers was Midshipman Wat
fon, now a rear admiral with a fleet of
his own.
It goes without saying, perhaps, th.it
the admiration of the Federal officers was
no whit diminished when they learned
subsequently that Just before the oak epi
sode the same six Southern girls had
wheeled, "by hand." a battery of light
artillery, which the retreating Confeder
ates had left behind, down to the levee
and had dumped the guns Into the rush
ing waters of the Mississippi, In order
that they might be of no service to the
invading â Chicago Trlbue.
ODDLY MATCHED RACERS.
Pigeons Outfly Honey Bees in a Mile
Course Trial.
Two men who lived In Wigtown, In Scot
land, became engaged in a controversy ns
to whether homing pigeons or honey bees
could fly the faster. Bach was so sure of
the correctness of his own opinion that ;
they resolved to make a test of the. mat
ter.
"But how shall we know that your fast j
h^e* are the right bees when they come |
in?" paid the man who owned the pigeons.
"Easily enoughâ flour' em," said the
other.
So a number of hers were carefully
taken from a hive, near evening, so that j
It might be altogether unllkHy that they
would loiter by the way. and sprinkled I
with fine, white flour, which stuck to
them. Then the bees and one homing ;
pigeon were taken to a point a mile away
from the pigeonhole and also a mile away
from the beehive, and all were liberated.
The pigeon reached Its journey's end
first, ha vine flown the distance in live
minutes and thirty seconds. The floured
bees came In thirty seconds laterâ in ex
actly six minutes.
The result did not prove a great deal.
so slight was the distance, and the bee
man tnlnkp he might win on a second
trial. Certainly neither pigoon nor b<rs
were very swift. Perhaps they were slow
In getting under way.â Youth's Compan

PAINE'S CELERY COMPOUND
RELIEVES PAIN.
Mrs. Margaret Bethel, of Brainerd, Minn., writes:
"For thirty years I have been a great sufferer from neuralgia
in the head and also with rheumatism in the whole body. I began
taking Paine's Celery Compound, and soon found that I was much
better. Before taking the Compound, my life was such a burden
that I almost prayed to lay it down. 1 was bedfast every two weeks
with horrible pain in the head, back and neck until 1 was almost
crazy. I am able to do harder work and more of it to-day than for
twenty-five years. lam really enjoying life again, thanks to Paine's
Celery Compound. I am satisfied that my life has been prolonged
many years by its use."
Paine's Celery Compound is a great reconstruct-
ant. The weakened, inflamed nerves are built up
and the nervous force increased. The stomach, liver
and kidneys are kept in healthy action. The body is
kept free of acid blood and morbid waste material; is
made healthy and free from pain.

NETTTNG QUAIL.
How the Egyptians Catch the Birds
by Thousands.
There has been much said lately of the
capture of quail in Egypt In regard to
the protest made by Frenchmen about
carrying the birds across French terri
tory for English use. The passage of
band of quail over the coast of the delta
of the Xile, from Port Said to Alexan
dria, begins In September and lasts a
| month and a half, the birds arriving: In
j little proups.
Generally they are taken by means of
nets five meters high, wnlch the natives
extend on cords fastened to poles, in the
fashion of curtains gliding on their rods.
|In reality the net is double. The first
I near the side of the sea is of meshes very
j large and loose, but at the back is an
other net where the bird will really come
and perch itself in the folds formed by
this net of small meshes.
There Is another method of capture
which is more picturesque. Rows of dried
branches are placed on the shore. At the
foot of each branch Is disposed a tuft
of fresh herbs, In the middle of which Is
arranged an opening which ends In a
snare. The quail, tired by its journey,
takes refuge In the branch, thon in the
bunch of herbs, naturally, without figur
ing to itself that it is going to put itself
Into a trap where a native will surprise
and kill it. With these means of destruc
tion. It is not astonishing that each year
more than a million of these birds' are
taken. â New York Sun.
Paris Pawnshops

He Is to Be Pitied.
How pnd is the man who wanders through
life
With nothing on earth to enjoy:
Unable to make others happy himself.
While everything seems to annoy.
His life is a cocoanut; minus the milk,
A dry. empty shellâ nothing more;
So pity rather than blame the poor man
Who has heard the story before.
Even a tramp may admire pictures, but
he Invariably draws the line at wood cuts.

THE LOST COM MISSION ERSHIP.
ONCE more the Southern Pacific Railroad has
succeeded i:i preventing the appointment of
a representative of the Pacific Coast to the
Interstate Commerce Commission. To the vacancy
occasioned by the resignation of Commissioner Cal
houn the I 'resident has appointed Joseph Filer of
Illinois, and all efforts made in the three States of
Washington, Oregon and California to procure the
selection of W. R. Wheeler have failed.
From the time of the creation of the commission
the Southern Pacific Company has opposed the ap
pointment of a man from this coast to a place upon it,
and the opposition has been continuously successful,
notwithstanding it was the intention of the framera
of the act creating the commission that among its
members there should always be a representative of
the interests of this section of the Union.
Commercially and industrially the States of the
Union are divided into five great groups, each group
being marked by certain characteristics which distin
guish it from the others. The commercial and trans
portation interests of no two of these groups are
alike, nor are the problems which confront business
men alike in any two of them. It was the design of
Congress in establishing the Interstate Commerce
mission to give each of these divisions of the
country an equal power in the commission, and ac
cordingly the act provides for five Commissioners.
Each of the other groups of States has always had
a representative Commissioner. The Pacific Coast
never hid one. The Southern Pacific, for reasons
known to its bosses, has antagonized every effort to
obtain such a representative, and it is because of that
antagonism this section of the Union has no voice in
determining transportation questions which affect its
welfare.
In times past the defeat of Pacific Coast aspiran's
for a Commissionership has occasioned but little com
ment. As we never had a Commissioner, a large
number of our people have considered it a part of the
natural order of things that we should never have one.
This year the case is different Certain demands made
by Chicago and St. Louis for freight rates prejudicial
to the coast have aroused our merchants, manufac
turers and producers to a realization of the danger
that threatens their interests. Out of the discussion
of that subject came an understanding of the ri.uht oi
the coast to a representative on the commission and
btain one. Accordingly the business men
of the three States united upon a candidate and recom
mended him to the President. Thus the issue was
raised, and Pacific Coast sentiment, so long indifferent
to the question, was thoroughly aroused.
It is to be noted that the right of the Pacific Coast
to a representative on the commission was rco
in the I ir merchants and manufacturers did
ye to make the fight without aid. The Phila
delphia ' and Manufacturers'
;ed the
cy of Mr. Wheeler, and in doing so reflected
the prevai ment of the Eastern public.
i the moment, however, that the movement for
er from the coast was started
unpany set about defeating it.
With their usual cunning, the railroad schemers
sought to divide the people, and for that purpose set
up a cand not succeed in
fomenting divisions among Pacific Coast people, but
they evide I I in convincing the President
that such division exists. The result i< the appoint
ment of a man from :
Once more, then, the railroad has triumphed, bit
this time the victory is likely to cost them dear. The

which will prompt the people to that action will be the

While in the act of discing into their pockets to
be to the â¢ Lady Randolph Churchill
to fit out a hospital ship for duty with the British
fleet in South African waters it might be well for
Americans in remember that the lady proved her
Americanism a long time ago by marrying a British
title.
THE NAVAL CONSTRUCTORS.
THERE i* no corps in the navy that has under
gone so compiete a transformation in the past
twenty year? I I E the naval constructors.
On January i. 1880, there were sixteen naval con
structors and five assistant naval constructors, of
which seven have died, six arc retired and three still
remain in active service. At the present time there
are twenty-one naval constructors and eighteen as
sistant naval constructors, making a total of thirty
nine officers in immediate charge of the construction
and repairs of ships.
The constructors of twenty years ago were, in the
! large majority, men of superior practical ability, who
! a long apprenticeship in the shipyard and
worked their way up.. They were rather deficient in
the scientific branches, according to the present stan
dard of requirements of a^aval constructor, but that
they did their work well is shown by the records of
the Hartford, Kearsage and many other ships of the
\ old navy. Aa graduates from the shipyard they were
; in thorough sympathy with the workmen over whom
: they had charge, knew how to handle large gangs
and get the best results without needless friction, and
it is only fair to state that the abuses in the navy-yards
of tho^c days were due to the acts of higher official?,
j to which the constructors had to consent or quit the
i service.
Since 1875 no civilian appointment? have been made
; in that corps, and all its new members are graduates
! from the Naval Academy. These are all highly edu
cated men, graduated after a four years' course at
the academy, supplemented by a couple of years at
foreign institutions of learning, and then commis
'. sioned as assistant naval constructors. They are, how
' ever, totally deficient in the practical part of their
profession, in which their training begins when placed
:in charge of men and work. The system is entirely
different from that of other countries, or, for that
matter, from the practice in private establishments,
where practical and theoretical knowledge in similar
: positions are absolutely requisite to the success of the
: work, and it would seem as if our Navy Department
has gone from one extreme to another.
In order to qualify for command of a vessel-of-war
the officer has to pass through successive grades and
linations, and it takes at least thirty years' ex
perience to become competent to command a vessel
like the Texas. On the other hand, the same ship was
built by one of the Annapolis assistant naval con
structors who had less than one year's experience in
charge of work, and the record of this "hoodoo"
ship, culminating at Santiago with bursting her decks
through the concussion of her own guns, disproves
the wisdom of having inexperienced men to under
-1 take such important work as ship-building.
i Of the one hundred and seventeen vessels of the
THE SAN FRANCTSCO CALL, SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 11, 1899.
new navy, built or in course of construction, one hun
dred and six are from plans of the late Chief Con
structor T. D. Wilson and Philip Hichborn, present
chief of the Bureau of Construction. Both of these
officers were practical shipwrights, and their handi
craft compares favorably with that of other navies.
Four vessels, the Indiana class and the Bancroft,
are credited to the Annapolis constructors; five are
from foreign designs, and two others, the Katahdin
and Dolphin, by outsiders. The old shipwright con
structors appear to have done pretty well, and the
new members of the corps are likely to be as efficient
after a long, tedious and costly apprenticeship.
Just now all is not so satisfactory as it should be,
for there are complaints from workmen at Mare Isl
and of too much militarism in connection with the
work. It is not to the liking of California ship
wrights and other mechanics to be treated as if they
were enlisted men, but this condition, while it is not
conducive to good and economical work, is the natu
ral result of a change of system. Complaint is made
that the present naval constructor is tyrannical, and
the Navy Department has been asked to have him
transferred. Similar complaints have been made
twice since 1891, and it is not likely that any more
attention will be paid to this protest against an un
popular officer than has been vouchsafed the griev
ance of a 16 per cent reduction in the shipwright's
pay within the past year.
In view of the fact that the last Congress added
from 33 to 50 per cent to the officers' salaries, the
mechanics and laborers are slow to comprehend why
they should receive less pay nt Mare Island than is
current in San Francisco. There is a marked change
In the condition and treatment of workmen at the
navy-yards, which are gradually becoming similar to
those of Europe. They are harassed by rules and
regulations such as prevail on board vessels-of-war,
and the officers are confidently looking forward to
the establishment of an enlisted force, clerks, me
chanics and laborers, such as exist? in the German
navy. From a military view it may be considered
qtiite proper to have the working force domiciled
in barracks, going to and from their work to the
music of drum and fife and the boatswain's whistle to
time the riveters and calkers. Things seem to be
drifting that way.
Latest reports from the South African war pos
sess one gratifying characteristicâ they are delight
hilly indefinite. They appeal to partisans of every
>hade of opinion; they picture Britons and Boers of
equal savagery and cruelty: they accord to both sides
the credit of victories of appalling significance: they
l"i??ess all the charming interest of other fictions
which arc not of current moment. Later in the sea
son, perhaps, the facts may be known.
THE STORAGE OF FLOOD WATERS.
HARDLY any convention that ever assembled in
San Francisco has been charged with a more
important mission than that which is to meet
next Tuesday for the purpose of considering Â«
and means for storing the flood waters of the State
and rendering them available for use throughout the
year.
The convention is to be a thoroughly representative
one, and it is believed will be attended by upward of
a thousand delegates. A widespread interest is felt in
the work to be undertaken, and among the members
will be many oi the most far-sighted, progressive and
public-spirited men in the State.
There has been some opposition to the plans sug
gested by the promoters of the convention on the
part of those who believe the whole work of water
storage and irrigation should be left to the National
Government. Such opposition, however, is not well
founded, as there is nothing in the California move
ment that will in the least antagonize or impair any
aid the National Government may be willing to grant.
On the contrary, whatever is undertaken at home will
have the effect of inclining Congress to be more
prompt in providing aid.
The attitude of the majority at least of the
promoters of the State movement was well ex
pressed by President Thomas in discussing the
subject on Thursday at the meeting of the
committee engaged in making preparations for
the convention. He is reported to have said there
.vere points in the National Irrigation Association's
plan upon which the advocates of the State plan could
agree. He believed that all were agreed that it was
advisable to get from the Government all that the
Government would give, but he reiterated that the
Government has no ownership of the water in a
stream, nor does it own the bed of the stream, and
that all its right, constitutionally, in the matter is to
regulate navigation between States and with foreign
countries; also that if the Government were to con
struct storage reservoirs for the purpose of maintain
ing the levels of rivers there could be no help from
irri gators from that source.
Whatever differences of opinion may exist at this
. it is quite probable that a plan of action may be
devised by the convention to which all fair-minded
men will agree, and for the accomplishment of which
all may cordially work. The importance of the en
terprise can hardly be overrated, and it is highly de
sir&ble that steps be taken as speedily as possible to
undertake it upon a comprehensive scale. The waters
which now nin in floods to the sea would be of in
calculable value if stored up for use, and the work is
none too great for a State like California to carry
out.
The police were rather late in asking for a show
down at Joe Harvey's Mason-street gambling game,
but when they called they certainly held the top hand.
The gamblers probably expected that Harvey'?
police friendship meant a different sort of a "wide
open" town.
It is announced that the rioting soldiers who ter
rorized the denizens of one of the local streets the.
other day are to be left to the mercy of the civil au
thorities. A few repetitions of rowdyism and law
lessness may leave the offenders at the mercy of the
people.
The woman who has asked Police Judge Graham
for a warrant for the arrest of her husband on the
ground that he has whipped her every night for a
year might learn something to her advantage by read
ing the domestic life of Socrates and his wife.
As a vote catcher William Jennings Bryan is not
a glittering success. His friends ought to persuade
him that he is a political paradox and will win more
votes by appealing to fewer voters.
Mare Island is threatened by a visitation from the
original kissing bug. It is said that Hobson is to be
placed in charge of the navy-yard and repair shop.
Chicago and St. Louis may not wish the earth
for their very own, but they do wish to crowd San
Francisco off it.
Bryan seems to be able to carry Nebraska easy
enough, but it is very hard on the State to have to
carry him.
CROWNS HER LIFE OF SACRIFICE
BY JOINING A RELIGIOUS ORDER
MRS. ROSE HAWTHORNE LATHROP has crowned a life of self-sacrifice.
She has become, in truth, the Little Sister of the Poor she so long has
been in spirit. With two of her associates, Miss Alice Huber and Miss
Higley, at St. Rose's Free Home for Incurable Cancer Sufferers, 426
Cherry street, New York, Mrs. Lathrop has just been received into the Third
Order of the Sisters of St. Dominic. Tins order is for lay men and women living
in the world.
Nearly three years ago this gently nurtured daughter of Nathaniel Haw
thorne, quietly relinquishing home ties and all the soft luxuries that are the
necessities of a life of ease, gave herself to the mission to which she felt herself
called. A course at a cancer hospital prefaced her opening of the three rooms
which she hired in a Scummol-street tenement. There, actuated alone by love,
she succored the victims of the most loathsome disease that curses humanity.
When her private resources began to fail, money came from outsiders. Her
Indomitable courage won the respect and support of the community. This hos
pital, free to her poverty-stricken patients, outgrew the accommodations. Quar
ters were taken in Water street. These in turn became inadeQuate, and the
Cherry-street house was taken.
Those who joined with her in this noble undertaking were known as "Ser
vants of Relief." A Puritan kerchief, close-fitting cap (.over hair closely cut
for hygienic reasons), a snowy gown and apron comprise the uniform.
Mrs. Lathrop was the wife of George Parsons Lathrop, the writer. Her own
contributions to literature were numerous before she entered upon what has
become her life work. She has long boon an ardent follower of the Catholic
faith.
THE DUTCHMAN.

The winds of many zones tugged at his

And beat his deck before his sails were
furled.
On, on and onâ three thousand leagues
of sea, ,
Untried, unknown, he traversed to be
free.
StolM and stern, unsightly and uncouth.
No scented d;,rling he for courtly ..;
But in that slow speech there was stead
fast truth,
And dauntless courage in that stubborn
frame.
On Alric's farthest capo he made his
home , Â
And thanked the good God ha cowd
cease to roam.
The Kings played chess, as Kings are
wont to play,
Each move an end to some fair land 3

On A file's fields, three thousand leagues
away,
One tyrant's flag came down, another
rose.
Tim Dutchman saw with gratitude
profound.
He hailed a saviorâ a worse tyrant
found.
Vain his long search o'er many sounding
Still on the heights doth freedom iove
to dwell.
To shake her tresses in the mountain
breeze.
And hear the tales the upland forests
tell.
Far to the North, where snowy sum
mits rise,
The Boer, outmastered, turned tils
longing eyes.
Before him lay long miles of arid plain;
Around him valleys full of pienty
smiled.
He yoked bis oxen to the lumbering wain.
The lambok spoke In menace shrill und
wild.
Bach mighty beast, submissive, bent
his neck,
And the Boer started on his long, long
trek.
Came days of aching toll. Night after
night
lie faced Death, eye to eye, and stared
him oewn.
With naked list he met the lion In flfcht
And sent him scurrying to his Jungles

Tho ravage blacks who came to spoil
and slay
Reeled back before the laager's atern
array.
Oh, Freedom dear, If ever man there was.
In all the ages, earned thy favoring
smile,
This patient man has earned It. In his
cause
Pleads till the world to-day. Yea, even
that isle
That hisses hate of him, thrills, too,
with strong
Deep notes of protest against Eng
land's wrong.
Gold! Gold! Gold! Gold! The cry filled the
air,
And wrought like magic on the hearts
of men.
The restless souls In every land who dare
Shake dice with Fate, felt the blood
leap again.
They came In squadsâ in troopsâ in
rushing stream,
Their motto ever this: "Follow the
gleam!"
But most were men of that proud race
who hold
The Triple Isle as trident of the sea.
What! Was this Boer to rule a -calm of
gold?
His slow hand to time the march of
Destiny?
So came the clash, and on Majuba Hill
That slow hand proved its swift, un
erring skill.
The old Colossus spanned the Rhodlan
Bay;
A continent the new one would be

From cape to Cairo drive his iron way.
And a new empire for his Queen pro

An earthquake laid the old Colossus

The new one laughs amid the earth

That the bold Dutchman dared their

HEAVY RAIN IN
MANY SECTIONS
Farmers Anticipate a
Good Harvest.
Special rÂ»BV>atch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO. Nov. 10.â rain fell
all night and up to noon to-day, when the
clouds broke away, but gathered again
later, and the prospects: are rood for more
rain, as the wind still stays in the south
east. The rainfall for the month Is 1.02
inches, and for the season 6.50 inches,
against one inch to an equal date last
year. The rain for the past two days
has been warm and vegetation is growing
rapidly. 'While the ground in most parts
of the county Is too wet for plowing, the
grain that ha* been sown looks well and
feed is coming on fast. The ground is
well soaked down to the bedrock, and
the present supply would be sufficient,
with light seasonable rains later in the
winter and spring, to insure a good crop.
NAPA, Nov. 10.â A heavy rain fell last
night, with frequent showers throughout
the day. The total rainfall for the sea
sod is 8.5S inches; same date last year,
1.52 inches.
FRESNO, Nov. 10.â The farmers are all
busy plowing at present, the rain thus
far "being sufficient to admit of tilling tne
ground. The indications are that an ex
tra large acreage will be put in wheat
this year, as after two dry years the
wheat growers are looking forward to a,
good season this year. Clovis Cole, tho
largest farmer in California, who farmed
Â£o,oiX> acres last year, is not through har
vesting yet, but will get through in a few
weeks.
NIL/ES, Nov. 10.â After a week's threat- j
;md two days of light showers, j
a heavy downpour here to
day. Considerable grain and hay is yet
in the fields and the second crop of grapes '
wiH suffer, while plowing and pruning
will he stopped for some time yet. The i

it for the storm was .57 of an inch,
making a total of 4.09 inches for the sea
son, as compared to 2.~'> inches to the
same date last year. This is the hr;i â¢
rainfall for this date since the fall of 1889.
SALINAS, Nov. 10.â A heavy rainstorm
started this morning. The barometer is I
low- and the wind favorable for a contin
uance. The precipitation is 2A*O inches for !
seasQÃ, against .27 of an inch this
lime last year.
S.\N JOSE, Nov. 10.â The rainfall for
hours ending at 8 o'clock
mini I >t bji inch; total for
3.48 inches; same date last
. 63 inches.
SANTA ROSA, Nov. 10.â The rainfall
was very heavy all over the county last
night and this morning. The Russian
Hivor rose almost as high as at any time
last season.
BURN, Nov. T\â The storm which
comment ed Wednesday night is almost
unprecedented as to precipitation. Throe
inches of rain have fallen, making 10
inches fur the season, aa against :* last
The W ' warm, and but
hull' snow has fallen in the mountains.
STO< X.TON, Nov. 10. After two days
of light rain and overcast skies the
clouds broke this evening and to-night
the promise of a riear day to-morrow is
k od. Tho fa: :i light all the
but the record for the nr>nth, ac
cording to the gauge at the Ii
is .89 "f an Inch, making 4. f'3 incnes
tor the season, against l.'So Inches I
same date last year. All the damage
ould be done by the rain was done
time ago, though the pr<
will increase the moisture in the ground
and delay plowing. The farmers an
g , . get anxious and the croaker
idy believes the ground will
dry out enough fur him to put in his
plows.

RAIN WAS GENERAL.
Northern Part of the State Fared
Better Than the Southern.
"The storm that has been with us for
the past forty-fight hours," said Weather
Official McAdie last evening, "has been
very general throughout the State. A
tremendous quantity of water has fallen
In the northern anrt central divisions, but
the southern portion, which needs it most,
seems to have been overlooked in the dis
tribution of pluvial favors. There was a
slight fall in San Diego and Fresno re
ceived just about enough to wet the
ground.
â¢"The bipgfst rain of this storm has
been in Santa Rosa, which registered a
fall of 1.0.5 Inches, making a total of 7.fÂ»u
against 1.69 (or the same period last sea
son, â  alistoga comes next with a fall of
.'Si in the last twenty-four hours, which
Is a total of 10.19 for the season, against
1.72 hist year, In this city the (all up to
G o'clock last night was .81, a total of \:.\Z
for the season. All the records show an
increase In rainfall over last season; and
the benefits that will be derived are in
calculable. It means a great deal of
water for the mines and wherever water
power is used; it means food for cattle
and that the farmers may now get to
work plowing the ground. It will also
have ;l tendency to put money in circula
tion, as it will dispel that uncertainty
which prevails regarding the weather in
this State. Some people have an idea that
the climate is changing here, but that
idea is not borne out by the conditions
which prevail.
"From report! just received there Is a
heavy storm off Vancouver, it having
moved up there from the Oregon coast.
There are thunder-storms at Eureka and
Baker City and a good high wind blowing
at the rate of sixty-three miles at Fort
Canby. This means more showers, for
San Francisco. The wind is now south
west, but will most likely shift back to
southeast again, [calculate however, that
we will have clearing weather Saturday
afternoon."
The following Is the rainfall up to yes
terday for this and last year:
Red Bluff, this year, 4.10; last year, 0.9 V
mento, this year, K.Ofi: last year, 1.00.

request was worded in a highly compli

PAUNCEFOTE'S THANKS.
Appreciates Kindly Sentiments of
Americans Toward Him.
â WASHINGTON, Nov. 10.â Lord Paunce
fote, the British Embassador, has been
very much touched by the many kind no
tices which have appeared in the United
States press on the subject of his eleva
tion to the peerage. He wishes to take
the earliest opportunity after his return
to the United States to express through
tho Associated Press his grateful appre
ciation of the manner in which not only
those with whom he has been brought
Into official and private relation, but the
American public generally, have received
the news of the honor conferred upon
him. Lord Pauncefote would wish also
to convey by this channel to those to
whom he has not been able to offer his
thanks personally, his cordial acknowl
edgments of their friendly sentiments and
for the congratulations they have been
pood enough to offer to him on this oc
casion.
PURSUING HIGHWAYMEN.
roVELO, Nov. 10.â It la now believed
that the highwaymen who robbed Frei
tag's saloon at Usal are two men known
as "Dutch" Henry and Dunn. They are
professional gamblers and make their
headquarters In Eureka. Warrants have
be*n Issued for their arrest, and posaea
will go Into the mountains in search 6f
the robbers. One party will be headed by
Denuty Sheriff Stevenson of lÂ«al and the
other by Officer Redwine of this city.
Fx-Sherlff Stanley says he will organize
another posse in case the other men fail.

PRISON DIRECTORS
IN A DEADLOCK
Unableto Choose a Suc
cessor to Aull.
Special IMspatch to The Call.
SAN RAFAEL., Nov. 10.â Since the
death of Warden Aull of Folsom Prison
more than a month has elapsed and dur
ing that period two meetings of the Board
of State Prison Directors have been held,
one at Folsom and one at San Quentin.
Rumors are rife of various influences be
ing at work to place Captain of the
Guards R. J. Murphy in charge of tho
institution.
Director Devlin -was the first man to
come out and advocate Murphy as Aull's
successor and In a short time he won
Director Hayes, the only other Repub
lican member of the board, over to his
way of thinking.
President Fitzgerald stands out for
Thomas Wilkinson, commissary at San
Quentin Prison under ex-Warden Hale,
while from tho best information that can
be obtained Directors Ray and Wllkins
aro in favor of the selection of William
L. A she. It Is known that Ashe is mak
ing a hard fight for the position, but the
probability at present is that a "dark
horse" will be elected warden. Several
are In the field whose names have not
been given publicity, and it is stated that
the Democratic merrfbers have agreed
that in no event will any of them vote
for a Republican. The board may break
the deadlock to-morrow at San Quentin
I'rison.
INHERITANCE TAX FUNDS.
Dickinson Will Decide Its Availa-
bility for School Purposes.
Attorney John H. Dickinson yesterday
addressed t.> Auditor Wells a commu
nication in which he outlines clearly just
what channels the moneys which will
fall to this city from the inheritance tax
must take before they are available. Upon
the question of whether or not money
so derived may be used in paying off back
salary claims of teachers, General Dick
inson Is not at this time prepared to ren
der an opinion, but with Attorney Cres
well will go to Sacramento on Wednes
day next for the purpose of discussing
that point with State authorities. His let
ter to the Auditor was as follows:

ELIZABETH LUNG
HAS SIPPED HER
WINE TOO OFTEN
Her Husband Secures
a Divorce.
AWARDED BY JUDGE MURASKY
>
HABITUAL INTEMPERANCE IS
THE GROUND NAMED.
No Mention of Alimony Was Made in
the Decree, but the Plaintiff
Will Provide for Err
ing Defendant.
Dr. George A. Lung, surgeon of the
United States cruiser Philadelphia, after
months of litigation has finally secured
a decree of divorce from his wife, Eliza
beth Lung, on the ground of habitual in
temperance. Judge Murasky ordjered a
record of the. decree made late yesterday
afternoon, and the gallant navy surgeon
is now a free man.
In his complaint for divorce Dr. Lung
charged his wife with habitual intemper
ance. Witnesses from Port Royal, on the
Atlantic seaboard, and from the Ha
waiian Islands, from the Norfolk navy
yard and this city were taken into court
to substantiate the plaintiff's charges.
Depositions from these points were also
secured, all bearing on Mrs. Lung's love
for liquor, and were read In evidence. Mrs.
Lung, In defense, charged her husband
with cruelty, claimed that at one time he
locked her up in a closet and afterward
choked her. The trial occupied several
days and was heard behind closed doors.
On one occasion Mrs. Lung created a sen
sation by assaulting Ben True, tho de
tective, in the corridor outside the court,
and then, after startling the court by her
sudden entrance, fainted away. On an
other occasion Dr. Lung caused a sus
pension of the hearing by breaking down
on the stand, and later the attorneys In
the case engaged in a battle of fists that
was only ended by the plaintiff after he
had received several well-directed kicks
on the shins.
When the testimony was all In George
D. Collins, who represented Mrs. Lung,
contended that even If the evidence sup
ported the plaintiff's contentions he could
not secure a decree of divorce in the
courts of this State, as he was not a legal
resident. The matter of residence was
argued for some time and then submitted
on briefs. Yesterday, however. Judge
Murasky decided ti.at the plaintiff was
entitled to sue in the courts of this city;
that his allegations were based on fact,
and in consequence he was entitled to a
decree of divorce as prayed for, which
was granted. No provision for alimony
was made, but Dr. Lung voluntarily
agreed to pay Mrs. Lung tSO a month as
long as she required that sum for her
maintenance.

to serve as a fund for this charitable
purpose. John Morrissey, S. H. Fried
lander, Harry Morocco and Mark Than
were appointed a committee to arrange
for the benefit.
The managers of the theaters have done
a great deal for charity in this city, and
have never shown themselves unwilling to
aid a good cause. This is the first time
that they ask the public to aid their own
interests, or rather the interests of their
employes, and the necessary assistance
should not be withheld from them. Tne
secretary was instructed to write to Froh
man and the other leading Eastern man
agers for support, and as this organiza
tion will be a help to every manager there
Is no doubt that a large amount of tick
ets will be bought by these people. This
association is the first of its kind ever or
ganized in America, and it is quite a
credit to the managers of this city, who
by their action proved that they stand
together and are eager to work for each
other's benefit. By means of this organi
zation the support of an indisposed actor
will not fall upon the shoulders of one
management.

DEMANDS AN INVESTIGATION.
Cathedral, 59, V.M.1., Wants Author
of the Election Circular
Punished.
The following resolutions were adopted
by Cathedral Council No. 69, Y. M. 1., at
a meeting held Thursday night:
Whereas, On or about the first day of No
vember, 1R99. a certain circular was published
and distributed by some person or persons un
known, purporting to have emanated from the
Young Men's Institute ar.d requesting that the
guff rages of ihn=f- to whom it was addressed be
given to certain candidates for the reason that
they were Roman Catholics; and
Whereas. The circular aforesaid advertised
particularly the election of those candidates
who were members of the Young Men's Insti
tute; and
Whereas The circular aforesaid Is a malicious
libel, a reflection upon and a gross misrep
resentation of the aims and purposes of our
order; and
Whereas, It Is reasonable to suppose that the
purpose of the aforesaid circular was to create
In the mind of the public of San Francisco a
prejudice against and a feeling hostile to the
Young Men's Institute. Therefore be it
Resolved, That we, the members of Cathedral
Council No. 59, Young Men's Institute, In reg
ular meeting assembled, demand that th^ B ard
of Grand Directors, representing the Grand
Council of the Pacific Jurisdiction of the Young
Men's Institute, thoroughly investieate the
origin of eaid circular, with a view of ascer
taining and exposing its author or authors; and
be It further
Resolved, That we pledge to said Board of
Grand Directors our heartiest support and most
earnest co-operation; and be it further
Resolved. That these resolutions be spread
upon the minutes of our council and copies
hereby sent to the dally press and the Insti
tute Journal for publication.
An Excellent Combination.
1 The pleasant method and beneficial
' effects of the well known remedy,
, Syrup of Figs, manufactured by the
i California Fig Syruf Co., illustrate
j the value of obtaining 1 the liquid laxa-
tive principles of plants known to be
medicinally laxative and presenting
them in the form most refreshing to the
taste and acceptable to the system. It
is the ono perfect strengthening laxa-
tive, cleansing the system effectually,
dispelling colds, headaches and fevers
; gently yet promptly and enabling one
to overcome habitual constipation per-
manently. Its perfect freedom from
i ! every objectionable quality and sub-
i I stance, and its acting on the kidneys,
liver and bowels, without weakening
; j or irritating them, make it the ideal
! laxative.
In the process of manufacturing figs
are used, as they are pleasant to the
taste, but the medicinal qualities of the
remedy are obtained from senna and
other aromatic plants, by a method
! known to the California Fig Syrup
I Co. only. In order to get its beneficial
j effects and to avoid imitations, please

THE GUNMEN
Ducks Are Reported Plentiful
in the North, but Are
Scarce Here.
MEMBERS of the gun clubs controll
ing extensive preserves are having
average sport with the- ducks, but
not as good shooting as they anticipated
some weeks Bince. All agree that the
weather conditions are not favorable for
driving the birds in and will not be until
the front conies and n^nds them down
from the north. From Tomales Hay
s.'iii.-* the Information th*t sprig and
canvasbacks are there in great numbers.
The gunmen of that vicinity are having
great Â»p<-.rt with them, but they are off
the line usually traveled by Hportsmen
of the metropolitan district.
The wet weather has interfered In a
degree with the men who prefer the sport
afforded by quail. The ground has been
too damp to be worked over in a BOtiÃ
factory manner and but few large bags
are reponed.

Upon being- taken before Justice West
they entered a pl*-a of guilty and were

Theo Kylka enjoyed some quail shoot
ing in tin- country beyond Santa Rosa
recently. He secured thirty-eight birds
the first day. He reports that nn- smoke
from the lon-st fires did great damage t"
birds and all varieties, of game. They
were killed by thousands ami thus leave
a comparative blank for the sportsmen.
City Attorney Boyd of San Rafael and
Henry M. Robertson of this city enjoyed
a good day's quail shooting on the La
Franchi ranch, near NovatO, last Sunday.
Thej returned in the evening with well
filled bags. They kept within the pro
visions Of the Marin County game law
by a narrow margin as regards the num
ber of birds that may be killed.
Phil Wand, with Paymaster King of the

days near Halfmoon Bay recently. They
found quail In abundance, but report
the country as "being a hard one over
which to work. They secured good bags
on eacb day they were In the iield.
Herman Oelrichfl is gratifying his pas

for the pleasure and the convenience of
club members are the most elaborate

on the coast.
Fred Feudner, J. Peltier and Attorney
Sweeney were in the Held near Hamlets,
Marin County, last Saturday and Sunday.
They secured the limit bag of twenty
five birds each on both occasions.
Clarence Haight and his shooting com

Frank Maskey went to Point Reyes on

quail. When he arrived on the scene the
rain was descending in torrents, and he
retraced his steps homeward without un

Final Series.
OAKLAND and Santa Cruz baseball
teams will play their final Beries of
five games in the California Baseball
League schedule this week. The San
Franciscos go to Sacramento to try con
clusions with the leaders. Despite the
stormy w<ather of the week, the local dia
mond has absorbed the moisture and the
games will be played as scheduled, unless
the storm continues throughout the fore
noon to-day. The wlndup of the season
does not promise to be exciting, owii >
the lead the Sacramentos have held so
long. Several times the local team
threatened them, but luck was against
them, and now the prospect of their do
ing SO is exceedingly remote. It ha-s been
decided to play the All-California team of

BOXERS IN TRAINING.
Alex Greggalns of this city and .Tack
Root of Chicago will meet In h twenty
round bout before the Western Club In
Woodward's Pavilion nÂ»*xt Wednesday
night. Greggains In his day has met
Sharkey, Btelzner and others of the
weight division with credit to him
self. He lias been oul of the ring some
time, but is always in practice.
Root is a smaller and lighter man, but
he has won numerous lights in and
around Chicago, where his ability as a
hard hitter Is recognized. He aspires, to
a ring engagement with Kid McCoy,
which Indicates his own estimate of his
powers. He has had several weeks' prep
aration at ('roll's Garden, Alameda, while
Greggalns is undergoing the conditioning
process at Blanken s Six Mile House.
The referee will be chopen on Monday,
and the Chicagoan has already expressed
a preference for Hiram B. Cook. He
would also be satisfied with "Jim" Mc-
Donald, the baseball umpire, or "Big
Bill" Lange.
Two ten-round preliminaries have been
arranged, the principals being Toby Er
win and "Jack" Ennis; Fred Ast und
"Jack" Wee.iv of Denver.
The first boxing exhibition of the Co
lumbian Athletic Club will be held in the
new gymnasium, 28 Golden Gate avenue,
on the 21sl inst. The principal bout on
the programme will be between Eddie

Armstrong, and a three round exhibition
between "Joe" Kennedy and Peter 1-ong
The gymnasium Is being arranged for the
comfort of spectators and regular exhi
bitions will be promoted while the pat
ronage warrants.
NOTES OF THE FISHERMEN.
The fishermen who visit the streams in
Marln County each winter In quest of
Steelheads have been much disturbed over
a law passed recently by the County Su
pervisors. This specifically prohibits fish-
Ing for Bteelhead trout during the close
season for other trout. In the subjoined
notes from H. J. MdsaaC, District At
torney of Marin County, he intimates that
the Supervisors did not contemplate pro
hibiting the fishing for steelheads. His
note reads:
In regard to steelhead fishing In Marln
County I will say that. In my opinion, un
der section in of Mnrln County Game Or
dinance 107, flshlni? for steelhead trout Is un
doubtedly prohibited durlnjc the close Mason
for other trout. I do not think, however.
that the Hoard of Supervisors contemplated
the prohibition of such flshlns, and, no
doubt, some action toward lifting the pro
hibition will be taken when the board
meetÃ again.
John Bonn and C. G. Toting have been
enjoying the steelbead fishing at Point
Arena. Mr. Young caught an elght
pounder and a ten-pounder, besides a
large number weighing three and four
pounds.
RACE OF HOMING PIGEONS
The third and last of the California
Homing Pigeon Club's young bird races
of the southern series was flown last Sun
day from San Lucas, a distance of about

LEASHMEN ARE
READY FOR AN
OPEN MEETING
Will Course on Merced Plains
Next Week for Big
Stakes.
LOVERS of the greyhound and the
leash will turn to the plains <>f Mi r
eed on Tuesday fur their annual
meeting in the open country. Fur nearly
a quarter of a century a tittle band of
enthusiasts have made this pilgrimage,
and have in the open country tented the
speed and the stamina of their grey
hounds. Tlicr. â  are found strong hares In
places with which they are familiar, and
it requires a stout-hearted dog to run one
of them down.
Th.' conditions nre all favorable for a
successful meeting this year, aa the rains
have softened the ground and have laid
the alkali dust, which, if present, stifles
both the dogs and the spectators. The
coursing will !>Â»â¢ held on the Nevada Bank
ranch, about eight miles fr. >m Merced.
It is reported to be in excellent condition
for coursing. From the entries already
received it Is apparent the coursing men
believe their lightweight dogs will make
the best showing. Dugs that are "sticky,"
that is, always trying, are considered
the must desirable, as the plains hare is
a strong traveler ;md will break the spirit
of the gamest dogs.
Home dogs that fail in the .irks or in
closed coursing fields are at home on the
plains and show wonderful form there.
Entries are expected from Merced, Sac
ramento, Stockton, Los Angeles and San
Jose. Erwln & Lyons of Dallas, Texas,
sent out May Queen and Silver Wings,
with special Instructions that they be en
tered for the meeting. Their dog Silver
Lion is also due here to-day, but will be
entered only in the parks. The Mclnerney
dogs of Merced are being given special
preparation for the event by Tom Fitz.
These and other country dogs are at
home on the plains and are expected to
render a good account of themselves. The
stake was won last year by the great
imported dog For Freedom.
The draw will be held on Monday night
at Pythian Castle. The excursion train,
carrying coursing men and officials, will
leave on the following morning for the
scene of the sport. Excursion tickets will
be good on the afternoon train If counter
signed by the secretary of the interstate
Coursing Club. Entries will be received
from any dog owner In. good standing,
membership in a coursing club not being
a requisite. Judge John Grace will be in
the saddle, while James Grace will han
dle the slips.
Recording Angel and Sisquoc, two
young greyhounds which have proved to
be sensational performers, will meet In a
special match at Union Park to-morrow.
Both are by Emm Pasha, the former
being out of J. Horn's Bona, while the
latter is a Wave puppy. They were both
whelped on the same day, October 19.
181*8. It is believed by coursing men that
Recording Angel will lead to the hare
but that Sisquoc will prove the better
worker when the pair reach their game.
The meeting of the two remarkable
youngsters Is expected to prove a great
contest.
The three parks offer tempting cards
for this week's sport. In addition to the
match between Recording Angel and Sis
quoc, the Union Park management has
a high class complimentary stake limited
to eight dogs and an open stake. At
San Mateo Park a seventy-eight dog
stake should afford those in attendance
all the sport they could desire.
A sixty-four dog stake of merit and a
consolation stake for dogs beaten in the
first round is the attraction at Ingleside.
The prizes are of exceptional value, as
this meeting is intended to replace the
club's annual affair on the plains.
"Jerry" O'Shea has applied to the Cali
fornia coursing committee for a rehear
ing of the case in which D. Hooper's
Koolawn was ruled off the coursing field
for a period of four years. She has
whelped a litter of puppies to Mr.
O' Shea's dog Young American, hence his
interest in the matter. He holds that
he was not a party to any fraud which
may have been committed and should not
be made to suffer for thÂ« sins of others
The case will be tried shortly and it is
expected the sentence will be cut down to
one year, thus restoring the value of
Koolawn and her promising progeny"
T. J. Mcllugh, field steward at Ingle-
Bide Coursing Park, has a promising san
ling on the way from the Bartels Kennel?
at Denver. It is by Hughie-Bonanza, and
lias a double cross of Sir Sankey the
sire of For Freedom, in its pedigree ' The
dog is called Mutineer and is nine months
olef lie will be entered at Ingleside when
fully developed. â  c "
Miss Frances Knowles has been made

nine boles in "A, which is considerably bet
ter than bogey, his score i>y holes being
o. 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 2, 3. It is likely that this

AROUND THE BOATHOUSES
For many years past It has hpen the
custom of the South End Rowing Club
to give an entertainment at its clubhouse
on the Sunday before election day, when
candidates for the various municipal of
flcea address the members and their
friends. Last Sunday a large number of
people were in attendance. Vice President
T. 1. Fltzpatrick occupied the chair and
introduced the speakers to the audience.
The South End Rowing Club officials
Intend to hold a regatta for members
only on the Sunday before Thanksgiving
day at I-ong Bridge. The principal event
will be a race between the "Midgets" and
the junior barge crew. This was to have
been rowed last Sunday, but the boat
house was so crowded that it was thought
best to defer the event. There will also
be some skiff races.
The Dolphin Swimming and Boating
Club has lately taken in a new member,
F. Baker, who is from Auckland, N. '/.
where he held the championship at ten
stone (140 pounds) in wager boats of the
Auckland Rowing Club. He will be a
valuable addition to the ranks of the .Dol
phin oarsmen.
At the last meeting of the regatta com
mittee of the Pacific Association the
amendment to the constitution and 'v
laws, which was proposed by J. P. Foley,
the South End delegate, that the regatta
committee consist of three representa
tives of each rowing club, instead of one,
as at present, was rejected. The amend
ment was proposed at the annual meet
ing of the association and referred by
the president to the regatta committee.
The amendment proposed by S. J. Pem
broke of the Alameda Boat Club with re
gard to the length and width of outi
skiffs was also rejected, the chief ground
of rejection being that if a new model is
adopted the existing skiffs will be ren
dered useless for racing and the clubs be
put to considerable expense for new
boats. Besides, the long, narrow, smooth
bottomed skiff proposed would have been
practically a wherry.
programme offered. There will be a nov
ice event, two amateur races, a profes
sional handicap, a match race between
Downing and Lawson, and McFarland
himself will make an endeavor to lower
the world's mile record paced by two
motor tandems which he brought out for
the purpose. MoFarland also thinks
meets can be promoted successfully on
the Olympic track here and at Sacra
mento and will "take a chance" later on.
Cards are out announcing the forthcom
ing wedding of W. L. H. Geldert, the

ACTED "THE LITTLE MINISTER."
Miss Katherine Oliver Appears in
Her Own Adaptation of Barries
Novel.
The large audience assembled to hear
Miss Katherine Oliver last night at the
First U. P. Church hail an opportunity of
seeing in the flesh the fascinating charac
ters Mr. Bar lie has depicted in his most
popular of stories, "The Little Minister."
Miss Oliver lias adapted from the novel a
three-act drama, whereby she shows ver
satility, the play being well constructed
and the climaxes striking. Miss Oliver
sustained eight characters, giving to each
a personality, gestures and dialect of his
own. She was particularly happy in her
impersonation of Micnh Dow, 'the lit
tle ragged boy, endowing him with
a plaintive Scotch accent in his scene
with Babble that went straight to the
hearts of her audience and earned
her two curtain calls at the end
of the second act. The old village physi
cian stood out In an equally prominent
manner the clever presentation of these
two widely differing characters affording
an excellent proof of her histrionic abil
ities. if Miss Oliver's audience of last
night demonstrates anything, an. artistic
performance does not pass unappreciated
here, and her engagement will prove a
financial as. well as an artistic success.
To-morrow night, at the special Invitation
of President Jordan, Miss Oliver will give
a Scotch and Irish reading before Stan
ford ITniversitV-

HUNTINGTON IS

GUATEMALA ROAD
Wants Central Ameri

WILL GREATLY SHORTEN TIME
MARTIN ROBERTS TELLS OP HIS
MISSION TO NEW YORK.
The Atlantic Seaboard to Be Con
nected by Kail With the Capital
of the Central American
Republic.
Martin Roberts, one of the largest finan
ciers of Guatemala and a man who Btands
high In the confidence of the Government,
Is a guest at the Palace Hotel, where he
registered two days ago from his Centra]
American home.
The mission that brings Mr. Roberts bo
far afield is nothing less than the sale of
a railroad owned by the Government of
Guatemala, and of which he is the lessee,
with the privilege of selling out. He has
been In correspondence with some East
ern capitalists for some time past, and is
now on his way to New York to consum
mate the dea.l.
Mr. Roberts, when seen last night, de
clined to state who the intending pur
chasers were, but from other sources it
was learned that the man who is inter
ested on the buying end of the deal its
none other than C. P. Huntington, who
now controls the Guatemala Central Rail
road, and who has iong had an eye on
the road controlled by Mr. Roberts, with
a view of purchasing and thus getting
into his hands practically all the paying
lines in the Central American State.
The road which Mr. Roberts is now on
his way to New York to negotiate for the
sale of is known as the Northern Rail
road of Guatemala, and run* from tho At
lantic seaboard to the city of Guatemala,
a distance of IST miles.
In this distance there is a sixty-mile
uncompleted gap which Mr. Roberts, bas
ing his opinion on reports submitted by
din"' rent parties of engineers who have
been over the ground, says can put
through at a cost of $l,u<X),oOu, a compara
tlvely low estimate when the difficulties
to be overcome are considered.
The road, when completed in one con
tinuous line through from Porto Barrios,
on the Atlantic side, to the city of Guate
mala, is expected to pay not less than 15
per cent at the very start, and it is
thought that this revenue will be very
materially Increased as the country
which it will open up develops.
Mr. Roberts pees in the completion of
this road, under the capital which Mr.
Huntington will be able to bring to It, a
very great advantage to San Francisco
and the Pacific coast, as well as to the
Atlantic cities, which will be brought into
much more direct communication with
the interior through being able to load
their poods on rails that have an Atlantic
seabonrd terminal. He says that while
the East will be benefited by this. It will
have the same effect on the trade of this
city by bringing fhe time from San Fran
cisco to the city of Guatemala down to
eight days, whereas now It takes twenty
three to reach the capital of the little
republic,
Kruttschnitt to Go East.
General Manager Kruttschnitt of fhe
Southern Pacific Company will leave
within the next two or three days for
Washington, D. C, to testify before the
joint commission of Congress to investi
gate postal affairs.
Tho commission has been sitting for
some time, and its object in summoning
the different officials of the various roads
Is to question them relative to their
contracts for carrying the United States
mails.
The Southern Pacific Company has just
contracted for 8000 new boxcar?, which
| will be delivered to the various roads in
: this State during the months of Decem
ber, January and February. With the
, help of these now r;i rs the company feels
I that the present congestion of freight will
be very materially relieved.

Pictures in New Frames."
"Do not Judge by the- bottle, but by its
contents," he said, "is a good "id Tal

phraseology, could be neatly turned into
a caution against forming an estimation
of an individual by the aid of the gar

V. ARTISTIC FURNISHING.
Houses and their furnishings do not ex
-Ist for themselves, but as a background
(or the people who live in them. Just an
the trees, rocks, fields, animals have for |
their setting the green earth and the \
blue sky; just as pictures have a back
ground, a middle distance and a fort -
ground, so human beings have their set
tings. If the setting be more striking or
more elegant than the people for whom
It exists, they are made insignificant and
uncomfortable by it. How many houses
there are whose furnishings are much
more attractive than their inhabitants!
A woman of superficial education and
trivial character prides herself on having
the most beautiful library in her State
rows on rows of the best books in beau
tiful bindings, in a room of the most
artistic design, and nobody to read them!
John Burroughs says that "every man's
house is in some sort an effigy of him
self." "When you build and furnish a
house you make public proclamation of
your taste, your manners, your sincerity.
If you wish others to think you richer,
more fashionable, more cultivated than
you really are you may fill your house
with exquisite things. Tet the contrast
between the environment and the owner
will be only the more evident and the
more pitiful.
The house and its contents should be
the outgrowth of the tastes, habits and
occupations of its owners. Farm life in
its best aspects is suggestive of breadth,
generosity, simplicity; of cleanliness,
abundance of sunlight, fresh air and good
food; of the beauty of nature and free
dom from stiff formality. These are the
things which the city dweller envies the
country man. The furnishing and decora
tion of the farmer's home should express
the breadth, beauty and freedom of his
life. It follows that some pieces of fur
niture and some kinds of decoration
which are offered in the shops are quite
out of place in a farmer's home.
On the other hand, city life is charac
terized by extreme limitations so far as
nature is concerned; and yet it is rich in
opportunities for culture and complicated
with every kind of mechanical con
venience and device. Space, air, sunlight,
pure water are precious commodities. The
whole interior of the house must be
adapted to the different aspect of numan
life. However varied the tastes and hab
its of city and country dwellers, however
limited or abundant the income, however
rough or dainty the occupation, one fact
pervades every kind of life and must
therefore be the basis of all principles of
dpcrntionâ "tho domestic spirit is quiet,
informal, unceremonious; loves ease, pri
vacy, low tones, loves the chimney cor
ner, the old armchair, the undress ga. - b,
homely cares, children, simple pleasures."
Whenever the home becomes a show
place, a museum of bric-a-brac and cu
rios, it violates the first and most im
portant requirements of the family. Ex
pensive and elaborate houses may provide
for both the domestic life and the public,
ceremonious life, but the average house
of the majority of Americans, which
costs from $1000 to $10,000, can devote
never more than a few rooms, and Bome
times only one, to formal entertainments.
The first principle of house furnishing is
therefore to have nothing which does not
contribute to the use, the comfort and the
refinement of family life. After these
have been taken into account those wno
have the nuuns may add elegance, Hix
ury and Btatellness to their establish
ments. The demands of formal hospital
ity must always be subordinate to those
of family comfort.
In earlier times, when class distinctions
and occupations were definitely marked,
people inherited not only houses but fur
niture as well. There was consequently
no temptation for them to imitate those
who were ncher than themselves. Much
of the hideous taste displayed in America
is the natural outcome of democracy.
Everybody in this country is trying to
rise, yet those who have risen are not
necessarily the cultivated in taste. Since
money can buy both real and sham ele
gance those who wish to appear elegant
imitate their superiors in clothes and fur
niture, often with disastrous effect. Imi
tation becomes, therefore, a dangerous
motive, for it is likely to lead to the
choice of articles which, however suit
able for some other family and jiowever
pretty in themselves, are quite inappro
pri.it-' in the situation of the purchaser.
Taste is a matter of cultivation as much
as is efficiency or honesty; skilled work
men are those who have learned their
trade well and practiced it faithfully;
honorable people are those who have
formed the habit of truth-telling. Taste
c;i n be cultivated by seeing beautiful
things and by analyzing- the principles
by which they have been developed: still
further by the habitual application .of
those principles in one's own household.
Man obtained his first conception of
form and beauty from the form and color
which he saw in the world about him. We
have only to apply the principles which i

are there displayed in order to have good
taste. Nature provides an Immense and
comparatively neutral background; ra
ture make? curves, rarely angles; nature
blends the most sharply contrasting col
ors together in the butterfly's wing, in
the yellow poppies in a green meadow, m
the feathers of the robin's 1. roast. The
greater part of the world* is in soft colors;
browns and (frays, greens and dull blues.
The brilliant reds, yellows, pinks and
purples are found in very small quanti
ties against a large neutral background.
The most beautiful Oriental rugs are spe
cimens both of rare handicraft and of an
exquisitely unconscious taste; for in them
vivid colors are mingled in such small
quantities on a rich background that the
eye Is .satisfied rather than startled by
the contrast.
Nature, except In the very lowest or
ders, never makes a hundred or a thou
sand things exactly alike. There is a
type, but the individuals always Bhow
slight variations. There are symmetry
and regularity in design, but not identity.
If this principle be applied to art In tha
household we sec at once that it is ab
surd to make household furniture in
pieces identical with one another. No two
individuals are alike in size and habit,
therefore the furniture and utensils pro
vlded for each slmuuld be adapted to his
use; but since individuals vary within
comparatively narrow limits articles of
general use may be made after a type,
with only the slight modification neces
sary to adapt them to the individual. The
artistic value of hand-made things con
sists not merely in the fact that they are
evidences of human skill, but in that they
have the individual touchâ no two of
them can be exactly alike.
The three main considerations in house
furnishing ate health, suitability and
beauty. The order of their application is
often reversed, to the permanent injury
of the housewife. The principle of ap
propriateness, when strictly interpreted,
throws one back on hygiene. Nothing can
be suitable which is not wholesome for
those who are to use it. At the same time
the first principle of decorative art is that
nothing is beautiful that is not wholly
suitable. Whether the housewife must do
her own work, with inadequate help, or
whether she have an abundance of ser
vice, the greater part of the housework
falls on some woman; everything there
fore should be planned to economize her
strength. Heavy furniture rugs are
wholly unsuitable, unless theNs is a man
to handle thf-m. Heavy dra\eries can
never, be sanitary unless frequently
cleaned; if proper provision cannot be
made tor doing this they should be dis
pensed with. Exquisite cleanliness is the
primary essential ' of good housekeeping,
therefore domestic architecture and in
terior decoration should be conditioned
first of all upon this requirement. Every
additional elaboration in living involves
more labor or less hygienic conditions.
This limitation should never be over
looked in furnishing the house.
Finally, when wholeaomeneas and suit
ability have been fully considered, the
sense of beauty may be gratified. Simple
and inexpensive things need not be ugly,
but often are so because they are poor
imitations or have been designed by taste
less persons, or produced mechanically in,
large quantities. Much is said of the ar
tistic things which can be made of very
cheap materials. Lret no one be deceived.
All beauty, except the beauty of nature,
is costly, either in money or thought.
Only an artist can produce beautiful ef
fects without money. Here and there are
people born with the sense of fitness and
beauty; to them such magic may be pos
sible, but in the majority of mankind the
sense of beauty is an instinct of slow
growth, developed only by careful culti
vation.
To summarize, then: The interior of
the house is a background for the peo
ple who live in it; it is a reflection of
them; it should be the outgrowth of their
tastes and habits. However varied fam
ilies may be, the family is not public and
formal, but homely and unceremonious.
The beauty of nature, when properly in
terpreted, is the best guide to the art of
man. Subordination, symmetry with
variation, perspective, are some of the
F\iKETPstions which nature lends to art.
Health, appropriateness and beauty are
the motives which should determine the
kind and character of furnishings and
decorations in a particular case. In the
following paper the practical application
of these principles will be discussed.

NEW YORK, Nov. 10.â The early part of the
day in the stock mark'-t was given over to a
continuance of the throwing over of st -'k
holdings which wa.-* in evidence yesterday. The
liquidation was on a large scale and braced
all departments of thÂ« list. The more highly
speculative industrials - wed the widest
changes, but the selling of the standard rail
road stocks was fully equal in amount. Th^re
was pa stock or group of stocks which took
a conspicuous place apart from othere, unless
It might be. said that the Iron and steel stocks
â were relatively somewhat iim-wr than the gen
eral list. The same n.ight bo said of Northern
Pacific and Union Pacific. Declines at the low
point exceeded a P'>int for many standard rail
rc>ad shares and In a few cages reached up
ward of two. points. Leather, after a break of
live poll rallied pomewhnt and retired into
the background of the trading, transactions in
It being small for the remainder of the day.
Pugar and Manhattan were rather weaker than
the balance of tho list, but they rallied with
considerable vigor. The latttr part of the Jay
â was given over to a gradual and very general
recovery of part of the earlier decline on a
much diminished volume of trading. Most of
the leading railroad stocks rallied a large frac
tion and a number of the trading specialties
between one and two points. Consideration of
the money outlook continued to dominate lent -
ment in the Stock Kxchange. The banks con
tinued to call li.ans for â Si: amounts the
rate for call money opening at 13 and running
up to 15 per cent. Large amounts of stocks
held' with borrowed money were thrown upon
the market. After each successive period of
liquidation the market fell into a condition of
eemi-stagnatlon. During the aftf-rnoon the rate
for. call money dropped off as low as 3 per cent
and the demand for stocks developed, which
caused the recuperation In prices to the closing
level. The usual preliminary estimates of the
â¢week's cash movements show.i a rather smaller
shipment to the interior than had l*en esti
mated, .though the ioÂ»s to the sub-treasury of
$3,w\000 was up to anticipations. The week's
net "loss In cash ie figured at over $4,00m,WÂ» from
all causes. The easing in the money rate to
day served to ameliorate the dread that to
morrow's bank statement would show an ln
erease In the deficit. Th loan contraction dur
ing the 'week has been large. There wag a
rumor on the floor of the - exchange that the
banks' resources had been Increased by means
of cash deposits by institutions in New York
City,' with a view to relieve the situation. This
rumor could not be traced to any authentic
source, "but affected sentiment on tho Stock
Exchange and Inclined speculative opinion to
look for. another surprise In to-morrow's bank
statement. The stiff money market resulted
In a- further drop in sterling exchange rates,
â which was assisted also by buying of stocks
here for London account, estimated at as high
as 60,0 f )0 shares. New York exchange at Chi
cago rose again to par, but at New Orleans the
exchange continued to run against New York.
Prices of bonds moved in sympathy with
stocks early In the day. but failed to respond
to the late recovery. Total sales, par value,
$2,330,000.

The markets here were less active to-day

tions of dearer money. Most worthy of these
was the taking of treasury bills offered at

I six months that, they would go under 4 per
! cent. Consols fell V American *ecuritles i
I began well, but relapsed on fears that New
York would not receive well the news of the I
rate on the treasury bills. New York, as a
[ matter of fact, sold freely and the close was
flat. Southern Pacific again leading the de
cline.

Bradstreet's Financial Review.
NBW YORK, Nov. 10.â Bradstreet's review
of the New York stock market to-morrow will
Bay: Although last Saturday's bank statement
I showed that the averages of the Clearlng
' house banks were beHw the l<sral reserve limit |
the stock market displayed little trepidation j
and on last Monday money was relatively quiet.
I^arge speculative interests apparently sup
| ported their specialties on a belief that the
i election would evolve no sweeping changes in
the country's political sentiment. This last
was substantially verified at the polls on Tues
-1 day and produced at the opening on 'Wednesday
not only considerable local buying, but foreign
support as well. It was, however, quickly evi
dent that professional interests were Inclined
to realize on the advance, and later in the day
leans were called freely by the banks, money
becoming relatively less plentiful and iates
naturally stiffened. These lalt.-r tendencies,
as well as the declines in quotations throughout
the list which accompanied them, were even
mere ptrikltmly displayed In Thursday's trad-
Ing, when the whole market developed decided
weakness, the Industrial strikes in particular
rH'.-. ting the renewed acute uncertainty about
the financial situation. There has been more
or lÂ»-.=H discussion as to the great possibility
that the Treasury will relieve the money market
by an offer to purchase bonds, or that tho
slight rises In New York exchange at Western
points arc preliminary to a movement of funds
from the interior to New York. It also does
not escape notice that foreign exchange rates
moved downward BimultaneoUKly with the
: hardening of call money. There seems, how
ever, to be no general expectation of gold Im
jj .rts, not only because of the war In Africa
an.) the rather sensitive financial position
both at London and on the Continent, but be
cause it is felt that any real danger of a flow
! of gold to the Tnited States will ireate a fur
ther and decided advance In rates for money
abroad. The conclusion, therefore, seems to be
that holders of stocks for speculative purposes
had become wearied of carrying them In the
face of a money market in which 8 per cent
i was a comparatively low rate and 10 to 15
I per cent appeared likely to be maintained with
("â¢me Intermissions. The liquidation Mhich to
I all appearance! set in after Wednesday, \ns
i without reference to the prosperity of the coun-
I try or the continuance of favorable reports of
j railroad earnings. It presented, on the whole
i an opinion in speculative circles that the money
| situation dominates the market, and that until
assurances "f relief from tight money were
; forthcoming it was useless to anticipate a con
tinued or permanent rise in prices. The appar
ent ending of a bullish manipulative deal in
Vnited States Leather common, which sto^lc

Bradstreet's on Trade.
NEW YORK, Nov. 10.â Bradstreefs to-mor
row will say:
Strength of prices, a natural outcome of past
and present active demand, is still the leading j
feature of the trade situation, notwithstanding â 
unseasonably warm weather in some sections of j
the country tends to restrict retail trade ana
necessarily has some effect on re-orders and
collections by jobbers. Less than ordinary in
terruption is indicated by election day observ
ances. The strength of textiles, both raw ana
manufactured, has been further accentuate !
during the week, increases being noted In raw
cotton, wool and hemp. â â,
The strength of textiles, leather, oils and
miscellaneous products was calculated to onset

has been equally strong, though transactions j
are smaller and a material gÂ»l" )n prices Is to
be noted, while from the manufactured goods
branch it was reported of confident strength |
and of probable future advances In men's wear
goods and carpets.
(Vreals appear to have reached a dead l p y,f>.
with prices showing little or no change. The
dullness of whÂ»at at domestic markets finds
explanation m~r>radstreet's statistics of w-rld a
stocks, which indicate a gain for thÂ» month of
(/ver 17.000.iX10 bushels, contributed entirely

Dun's Review of Trade.
NEW YORK. Nov. 10.â R. G. Dun & Co.'s
weekly review of trade to-morrow will say:
The most noteworthy feature of the time Is
the rise in prices. Cotton rose on Wednesday
to 7.ki cents, with much excitement, putting
the price 2H cents higher than it was a year
ago, and yet it was still higher in September,
1597.
Wool has risen relatively moroâ about 10 per
cent In two weeks, and the average of 100 quo
tations by Coates Bros. Is higher than it has
been at any other time since May, 1593.
Pig Iron has risen further, *25 being quoted
for Anthracite No. 1. the highest price since
January. ISS3.
But Hides are at the highest point since Jan
uary, 1573. having risen all the year with very
little reaction. Prices of products have not
correspondingly advanced. Leather and Boots
and Shoes were higher in November. 1895, than
they nre now; Cotton goods were higher In
January. 1*96, and Woolen goods In July, 1594;
and even the products of Iron, although greatly
advanced, are not as high as they were In Jan
uary. !â¢:â '
Such wide discrepancies In advance cause
much embarrassment, but are the natural
characteristic of a rise which Is mainly due,
not to concerted action in any trade, but to
the pressure of a consuming demand, the great
est ever known, which . for the time exceeds
supplies, though very unequally. Its results
begin to justify the conservative feeling which
finds expression In many branches of business.
The iron industry, which has led all otheru
in the advance, bow leads the way toward a
readjustment of values. While contracts for
pig cover the entire product of the most impor
tant districts for Mx to nine months In ad- \
vance, many of the consuming works In some i
lines approach the end of their orders and have
new competition to meet, so that sheets have â 
fallen $4 per ton at Pittsburg and $9 from the
highest point in September, and plates are $Â«
lower there and $3 at Philadelphia. At the
same time bars are $1 per ton higher, both at
Philadelphia and Pittsburgh the demand ooing
enormous, and at Chicago very heavy contracts
have been made for car and implement works.
A bridge combination is thought likely to af
fect future business In structural shapes, which
continues large for the season. A break In the
London market depressed Tin. and sales were
made at 28 cents. 800 l and shoe makers are
generally getting about the 10 cents per pair
advance they have held necessary, and have as
large contracts in most lines as they now wish
to close, in view of the uncertainty about
materials. Leather continues very strong, and
In that also dealers are not anxious for greater
commitments, but the consuming demand
causes large sales In advance of production.
Wool has been very strong again, though
sales at Boston were but 13,404,000 pounds,
against 21,657,300 pounds the week before; nut
largp transactions elsewhere raised the week's
aggregate to 20.201,000 pounds, and buyers hold
firmly for outside prices. Nothing like the
sensational rise of last week has continued,
and the buying by manufacturers is slow,
though still large. This and accounts of good
trade Indicate that an extraordinary business
Is expected for the next season.
Th'- risi ll â â  -t helps manufacturers
whose contracts cover production well ahead.
but the lining has been mainly by trnilerp and
largely on expectation of n very low cs
timate of yield by the department. While last
year*! estimate was not highly ai'cu
irade here and abroad then
counted on a large crop and was right.
Wheat t:a= not been very active nor strong.
although Western receipt.! have much declined,
being 4,Ti:!1,%7 bushels for the week, against
i* bushels last year. Exports ar>' also
smaller, the Atlantic being 2.. r ,ti3.637 bushels,
flour Included, against 3.335,f.n0 bushels for the
week last year, and Pacific L 188 ,699 bushels,
against l.r>K:tfil bushels lust y*Â«r. The decrease
In foreign demand may be ascribed In part to
heavy previous exports, hut perhaps still more
to the great mnvemÂ°nt of Corn, 3,450,104 bUSheIM
for the week, against 2,062,331 bushels last year.
Corn advanced about as much as Wheat fell,
though with prospects of a heavy yield.
Failures for the week have been 157 In the
Dnited States, against 211 last, year, and 23 in
Canada, against 2H lapt year.

Chicago Grain Market.
; â¢ "
i CHICAGO. Nov. 10.â Information completely
discouraging to the bull sentiment caused an
i opening break in wheat of %@%c. December
â¢ started at 67% c and May at 71%@71%c. Liver
pool was weak and grew steadily weaker with
the progress of trading, but the chief factor
In the decline was the heavy Argentine ship
ments, which caused a lot of liquidating by
local longs. The Argentine supply was gen
erally supposed to have been exhausted and the
news that shipments from the other side of the
equator were 1,752,000 bushels came as a sur
prise. The price held for a short time on the
. buying of shorts and against puts, December
1 touching 67Â»4c and May 71% c, but the letting
out of long wheat caused a decline, December j
dropping to 67% c and May to 71V s c. A report
that the Argentine crop had been injured by
frost and dry weather caused a rally from
the bottom, but as there was no confirmation
i of the report the little gain was soon lost.
Covering by shorts near the end of the sea
â  sion caused an advance, December going to
67% c and May to " 15 v: %@%c below yester
day and the close was at those prices. A
feature of the market was the narrowing of
the December-May spread to 3%c, with a good
deal of changing as if the elevator people were
accepting the difference.
I An undercurrent of confidence in the future
I value of corn rescued that cereal j from the
demoralization which struck wheat. This, It
is believed, was largely based on the small
ness of country offerings. December closed at
3Hii@3l%c, unchanged from yesterday. May
closed a shade down at 32% c asked.
Oats were neglected by speculators, selling
within a range of Vie and acting in a sluggish
sort of way with corn. December closed at
22% c.
Provisions excited little interest. Buying of
i December pork aided the price for a time, but
the weakness of the grain market and lower
hog prices counteracted this. January pork
closed 5c lower, January lard a shade under,
and January ribs 2%0 lower.

Butter Is again cheaper. Eggs ana Cheese
are unchanged from last week. ;
In Meat the only change Is in Hams, which
are cheaper. Fresh Meats bid fair to continue
high for some time to come.
Oranges are coming in more freely, and will
soon be plentiful. The other Fruits' are- now
practically limited to Apples, Pears and Grapes,
and the rains are rapidly finishing the latter!
Vegetable? stand about the same as usual.
Some kinds of Poultry are less plentiful
owing to diminished receipts from the East'
but prices show little change. Game continues
too dear for the ordinary purse
Fish is scarce, owing to the storm, and thÂ«
prices are high. ' Â°

ther surprise verdlcl was rendered
n Judge Hall's court this after
| Pen en, accused
[gaacs, was found
â¢â¢gu;;- â¢ â  commend
- - | lurt.
As Court Clerk Pierce announced the
result of the jury's deliberation Permian
broke down and cried like a child.
'â¢Didn't I know that I would get it?" he
gobbed, as he rested his head upon hi?
aged mother's shoulder.
Permian and many of his friends who
had testified at the trial had held do
doubts that the jury would promptly
acauit. In fact, Deputy District Attorney
Harris during his argument before the
fury yesterday, had not once asked for a
verdict of conviction. The nearest ap
proach to any such suggestion was when
lip â id â â¢] leave the matter in your
hands and all I ask is that you will do
what you think is right."
T&e case was given to the jury at 10*0
o'clock this morning and a verdict was
arrived at shortly after 3 o clock this
Afternoon. Once during their delibera
fj"na the jury came into court and asked
the penalty* in the event of Permlen s
ronvPetion. Judge Hall announced that
the maximum punishment was five years
imprisonment or 15000 fine, but he in
structed the jury that this was no con
cern Of theirs, as the jury has to deal
solely with the evidence.
" T'Vrmien's sentence will be pronounced
B xt Wednesday, but a new trial will be
moved for at that time most likely.
The Jury was made up of M. J. vÂ«
;-nuÂ«ria Thomas Kearney, A. McManus,
Alonro Bradford, C. H. Gray, John Gal
wiv William Berry, R. S. Falconer, J.
(^Stanley, T. A. Downing, I. K. Hall and

At Permien's preliminary hearing In the
Police Court the defense made little or
no effort to secure his discharge.

GAGE WRITES OF A
SITE FOR POSTOFFICE
OAKLAND, Nov. 10.â Secretary Gage
I letter to Congressman Metcalf
stating the position of the Government on
'akland postoffice matter. In hla let
!â  ; M r. < rage Bays:
From estimates prepared in the office of the
supervising architect, based upon data re
coived from the various branches of the public
eervloe to be accommodated in said building,
It appears that a building of sufficient size
and of such design anil appearance us a city of
tho Import of Oakland is entitled to will
cost approximately 1200,000 thus leaving avail
able but $50,000 for the acquisition of the site.
It will therefore be understood that this de
partment does not assert that bidders have
[â laced fictitious valuation upon their property,
but rather that suitable sites have not been
offered In that section of the city In which the
department believes the building should be
erected at prices which it feels Justified in pay-
Ins. While It is doubtless true that Rome "of
the sites offered range sufficiently low in price
to come within the amount which the depart
ment is willing to pay. It Is not understood
that any such, of suitable size, are conven
iently and centrally located with reference to
the business center of the city and the direc
tion in which business and population are ex
tending. If the department Is in error in this
regard It will be pleased to give consideration
to any statements you may submit to correct
such erroneous impressions.
What the department desires to secure, if
possible, is a site centrally and conveniently
located, of adequate dimensions and proper
prade, where good foundations can be secured,
at a price not exceeding $50,000. If, through
your good offices, a bid on such a site can b"
secured, the department will appreciate you"?

GAMBLERS TRY
TO PROVE KENO
IS NOT COMBO
Delicate Point for a
Court to Decide.
Oakland Office San Fran<
DOS Broadway, Nov. 10.
Judg* Smith and a jury have to di i Ide
what is "keno" and what is "combo," and
the* Question appears to resolve Itself into
the time-honored problem of whether a
rose by any other name would smell as
swÂ»et.
When the cases of fifteen gamblers
were called In the Police Court this morn
ing Attorney (Jarrlty asked thai the pro
prietor be tried tirst. and to have all the
other cases determined upon the Issue of
Qlrard's case. City Prosecutor Leach
ile, 'lined to make any such stipulation,
but he agreed L nat if the couri decided
that the games conducted by ' â¢ i r^t i-ri
were not keno he would agree to the
discbarge of all the other defendants, but
as this proposition was n â  â¢ t satisfactory
to the gamblers' attorney the caaus were
continued to November 15 to be Bet.
The point .to be decided la windier
"combo" Is "keno," even though called
by its new name. It is alleged by the
police that the game raided on Wednes
day nighi Is the same game thai they
have raided in other parts of the town
when It was called "keno." It was the
same dealer, the game paraphernalia, the
same system and the same csowd. The
only difference consisted In the manner In
which the winners were paid. Instead
of receiving the money outright less the
commission, the young gamblers were
given checks which they negotiated at the
counter. There was a little legend pinned
on the wall which was a new feature of
the game, reading that "this game is
only for cigars."
The dealer calls out the numbers as
they fall frnm the little barrel while
playing combo. Just the same a.s he did
for' keno; in fact, it is the same barrel.
'x ne gamblers sit around with cards, on
which they put cheeks while playing
combo, just the same as they did when
playing keno; in fact they are the same
cards and checks. The dealer puts the
balls as they come out on a large board
just the same tor one game as for the
other; in fact it Is said that it Is the
same old board that has already been
seized two or three times by the police.
Whether a jury, if one he demanded, or
the court, will decide that combo is keno,
or that keno is combo, or that both are
one and the same thing, is the question
upon which hangs all the cases on the
docket.
Cjraid says that comho is a game of his
own invention and that it le not anything
like keno, and as there is no ordinance
or Stale law forbidding combo, he says
he is confident that he cannot be con
victed. _^__________

REALTY VALUES INCREASING.
THE recording of the agreement to
sell a large section of the Baldwin
Hotel site for $1,100,000 was ihe sub
ject of general comment among, real
estate dealers yesterday. The price
is generally consldeTed fair, but there is
some surprise that Baldwin should agree
to divide this magnificent property, espe
cially in view of the fact that it has
been his boast on more than one occasion
that whoever secured the property would
have to take the entire hotel site, not,
however, Including the annex property.
But It is by no means certain that Bald
win will abide by the conditions named in
the contract, which was signed on his
behalf by Thomas Magee Sr. Baldwin is
already complaining that the price is too
small and declares that he will not sell
the property at the figure named.
Whether or not he does stand by the
agreement depends upon the character of
authority Mr. Magee was acting under
when he made the dicker with Mr. Flood.
There are plenty of people who say the
compact is of no value, but those best
familiar with Mr. Magee's business
methods are of a different opinion.
There have been no sales during the
past week Involving large amounts, but
there have been plenty of Indications of
a decided upward tendency in values in
the wholesale district. Landlords are
rapidly taking advantage of the demand
for accommodations in that section of the
city and a large number of old, out-of
date buildings are undergoing the oro
cess of being modernized. Those who
hesitate to go to the expense of putting
their buildings into first-class condition
will be the losers, as the antiquated
structures cannot compete in securing
paying tenants with their more modern |
neighbors. As an inducement, to expend
a little money, in this direction attention
is called to the fact that rents in the
wholesale district have increased about
20 per cent during the past few months,
nearly ail renewals of leases being made
on that basis. Bovee, Toy & Sonntag re
cently leased a building for a client at an
increase of 40 per cent In rental. How
ever, notwithstanding the increase in
rents and the remodeling of old buildings,
the demand for more room is so great
that it cannot be met. It la largely due
to the fact that owners are able to rent
their buildings to such good advantage,
in comparison with a few years ago, that
they are not anxious to sell, consequent
ly, while there is plenty of money seeking
investment in this class of property,
sales are comparatively few.
Another indication of the prosperity of
the wholesale district is seen in the fact
that the Market-Street Railway Company
is about to ask for a franchise for a
street railway to extend from the Junc
tion of Bush and Sansome streets, across
Battery and Market streets to First,
thence to Folsom, thenco to Second,
thence along Second to Bryant and down
Bryant to the Santa Fe depot and the
Pacific Mail dock. This road will, when
completed, be a great boon to that sec
tion of the city, and the North Central
Improvement Club has assured the Mar
ket-street railway officials that it will
back the application for a franchise with
all its influence. ' :â¢,â  â¢

Savings oanks, building associations
and private capitalists loaned $234,170 on
real estate security during the week end
ing November 4, which Is $167,230 less than
they loaned the week previous. $401 400
The loans of the savings banks aggre
fated, $184,325. and were as follows- Hi
bernia, $134,225; German, $14,850; San Fran
cisco Savings Union, $2200; Savings and
Loan. $7000; Humboldt, $84.10; Security
$10,800; Mutual, $2900, and French. $3950
The loans of the building associations
amounted to $15,900, and the loans of pri
vate capitalists and others to $33,946 All
the loans by the/Hibernia and Mutual
were at 6 per cent, the former including
one of $34,000. one of $21,150, one of $14,500
and one of $13,500. Releases for the week
were $294,050, against $529,415 for the pre
vious week.
Mortgage loans in San Francisco and
their relation to the prosperity of the city
are touched upon in Thomas Magee &
Sons' Real Estate Circular for November
in the following language:
"Nothing belter indicates the stability
or instability of real estate values In any
city than the amount of mortgages due
thereon. The assessed value of the real
estate and improvements in San Fran
cisco for 189y was $285,200,090. Although
real estate in many places is assessed for
more than it Is worth, as a whole as
sessed values are not by any means equal
to market values. The total mortgages
now due on all â¢our city real estate and
buildings thereon are *49,814,u57. The total
number of these mortgages is be
tween 17,000 and 17,500. The total
number of lotsâ that is the subdivisions
of landâ ln San Francisco for the wbjle
city and county is now 96,170. So that,
numerically considered, only about one
lot In five has a mortgage on it In this
city. Of the total of 17,500 mortgages now
due in San Francisco, almost precisely
10,000 are held by our savings banks.
There Is probably hot a city in the United
States that can make a showing of such
complete solvency as San Francisco does
in the above facts. It is both a marvel
and mystery why more money is not
being borrowed. It Is now offered at 6
I>er cent a year gross, or say, deducting
the average rate of the mortgage tax,
at 4 1-3 per cent net; yet instead of that
number of mortgages increasing, taking
one month with another, they are on the
decrease. The banks have been forced
for the past two years to turn to first
class stocks and bonds to get rid of their
money. And yet between them all they
have many millions unemployed."
But five building contracts wore filed
for record during the week just ended,
their aggregate value being $16,065. 'Lie
largest was that entered into between
Morris and Meyer Lando, owners, and C.
1.. Williams, contractor, for the erection
of a three-rtory frame building on the
northeast corner of Ellis and Octavia
streets, for $t r 9ofi. The same owners con
tracted with James F. Ford for the
plumbing, crastittii-g and sewering of this
building, to cost $1185. Mrs. E. B. Crock
er let a contract to John G. Cook for ex
cavation, grading and foundation for the
former's new residence on the northwest
corner of Franklin and Clay itreets. The
cost of this work is $1580. I. J. Muma and
Lawrence Kaar^burg, representing the
lated students of the University of
California, and G. C. Leiter and F. I*
Berry, representing the associated stu
dents of Stanford University, contracted
with Andrew Wilkie for the building of
grand stands, incline, boxes, admission,
and ticket gates, fences, aisles anil parti
tions on the Mechanics' Institute grounds,
bounded oy Fifteenth, Hairison, Six
teenth and Folsom streets, at a cost of'
$3000, these grounds to be used for the
coming football games between the uni
versities.
Sixty-eight contracts were entered into
during- the month of October, the same as
for the sfime month last year, but the
value is much greater, the figures being
$395,227 for October, IS9O. as against $225,299
for October, IS9S. In fact, there has been
a steady increase in the amount of build
ing for the past year, the total amount
for tho first ten months of 1599, as repre
sented by the contracts filed, being fully
J1.084.553 in excess of the same period a
year ago.
Bovee, Toy & Sonntag, representing the
estate of the late Harry Emeric, have
leased the first two floors of the building
416 and 4 IS Front street to the Leonard
& Ellis Valvollno Oil Company for a term
of five years. The lessor is one of the
largest firms of the kind in the country
and proposes to make San Francisco the
headquarters and distributing depot tur i
its Pacific Coast trade.
Jerome English, formerly of the real
estate firm of English & Morrlsey, has
withdrawn from the firm and Is now es
tablished at f>"d Market street.
Efigar Bilggs, recently of the real es
tate firm nf Briggs & Winant, has with

AROUND THE BAY
Work Is Progressing
Slowly.
RECEPTION IN THE EVENING
LOYAL LEGION HONORS THE
VISITING WARRIOR.
Tennessee Ladies and Members of the
Order Gather to Welcome the
Commander of the
Army.
Major General Nelson A. Miles divided
the first day of his present visit to San
' Francisco equally between business and
social pleasure. Yesterday morning 1 and
afternoon ho gave over to an inspection
of Alcatraz Island and the fortifications
'on the Marin bluffs. Last night he was
tho guest of honor at a reception tendered
[him by the Loyal Legion in the parlors
[of the Occidental Hotel.
"I examined tho fortifications of Al
[catraz, Llmo Point and tho Marin shore
iquita thoroughly," said General Miles
-after hia tour of inspection. "The work
j)ias progressed slowly, but every day has
â¢added something in the way of gun pro
tection to this port. If the present plans
âºÂ«.re carried out in full, this harbor will
{"be one of the best fortified bays in the
i-world. When completed the cost of all
âºthe fortifications and guns to be supplied
{â¢Will reach $11,000,000. Of course this will
tin a great measure depend upon Congress
and what It Is willing to appropriate for
[the purpose.
! â '1 have gone over the ground and will
report my findings. 1 have many sugges
tions to offer, but do not care to disclose
;tntm now. The work should be hastened.
"When all the guns are set and the earth
works buiidÂ«d. San Francisco will have a
â¢gun protection from the Cliffy to the
kouthernmost limits of the city."
After a dinner with some of bis friends,
General Miles was escorted to th( Oc
tCidentaL where many of the members of
irti.e Loyal Lesion and guests were gath
ered awaiting his arrival. It was y o'clock
â¢before the guest of honor stepped into
the hotel parlor, and he was greeted with
: a generous hand-clapping, the band sta
â tloned in the hall playing national airs.
'Acting Commander Colonel W. li, Par
nell introduced General Miles with a few
-well chosen words, and then the members
of the order passed in line before him to
,bid him welcome.
â¢ Forming a line by twos, the Loyal
jlseglonists marched from the parlors to
tho dining-room to the music of "March
ling 1 Through Georgia," The delegation of
Tennessee women, who are here to wel
icorao the returning volunteers of their
own State, were stationed along the line
lof march. They made an arch of Ameri
con flags, down which General Miles, es
cort and Lcglonists passed to the supper
â¢table. When all were seated, Colonel
JParnel] aruse and in a short sneech bid
fill a hearty welcome. The Tennessee
Sadies presented General Miles with a bas
ket of flowers, which he acknowledged in
a. graceful speoch, paying tribute to the
volunteers generally and particularly the
'men of the Tennessee regiment.
The reception was rather Informal in
Character, but none the less enthusiastic
end fitting. Seated on either side of ! m
mander Parnell were General Miles and
General Shaft At the same table were
peated General N. P. Chlpman . General
Dickinson. Adjutant General Seamans,
General Barnes, Major W. O. Gould,
Colonel J. C. Currier, Colonel C. Mason
Kinne and Inspector General Brantner of
Tennessee. Prominent among those who
â¢were present were Colonel Smc-dberg,
iColonel Mosby and Senator Perkins.

DYNAMITE STICKS
SCARED WHITTELL
JOSEPH RANCH, an Austrian, was arrested yesterday morning for threat
ening to destroy with dynamite the Whittell residence, on California
street. The man has been terrifying the Whlttells for nearly three years,
and on one occasion went so far toward carrying out his threat as to place
three sticks of the powerful explosive In the yard near the rear of the house.
After Ranch was taken to the City Prison yesterday Chief Lees questioned him
at length, and reached the conclusion that he was a dangerous lunatic. He was
examined by the Commissioners of Lunacy later in the day and committed to
the t'klah asylum.
The man first appeared at the Whlttell home about three years ago in the
guise of a tramp. He pleaded that he was starving, and was apparently so earnest
in his statements that the family took compassion on him and gave him employ
ment as a watchman. It was not long before he began to exhibit anarchistic
.tendencies. His actions became intolerable, and at the end of about a year and
a half's service he was discharged. Some months later he appeared at Mr.
Whittell'a office, on Montgomery street, and claimed that there was a balance
due him of 1146. When Mr. Whlttell evinced no disposition to cheerfully hand
over that amount of money the Austrian announced that it was a case of coin,
â¢ or he would send the Whittell mansion into the air In chunks.
He was arrested at that time on a charge of disturbing the peace, but "or
some reason that is not now explained he was not prosecuted, and subsequently
received the 5146 he claimed was due him. After this episode the Whlttells en
joyed a period of immunity from the threats of the anarchistic Austrian, until
three or four months ago, when he again appeared at the Montgomery street of
fice and mentioned a little matter of $70 which he claimed he had overlooked in
the last settlement. He had some difficulty in effecting a compromise, and when
his chances of getting any more money appeared to be â¢ rather slim he placed
three .dynamite cartridges near the kitchen door of the Whlttell house one night
and awaited developments. They did not explode. They were not Intended to,
for neither caps nor fuse were anywhere in evidence. The following day Ranch
was paid $40, with the understanding that he should leave the city at once and
stay away.
Yesterday morning he reappeared in front of the California street residence
and terrified the inmates by shouting to them to be prepared to go skyward. Po
lice Officer Chappelle was sent for and he placed Ranch under arrest. The man
is of powerful build, of surly disposition and extremely desperate in appearance.

at extortion. In applying for the warrant he said that the
attack in La Cntica was a falsehood from beginning to end,
evidently inspired bj>some unknown enemies, who had paid
Mancini to make it. In fact, the doctor said Mancini had told
him as much nnd offered to desist for $luO. whereupon Dr.
Lucis ran him out of his office and hustled him downstairs.
The officer intrusted with the service of the warrant had
been unable to find Mancini last night for tho very good
reason that the editor carries his office under his hat and, as
that bit of headgear is like so many others In the local Italian
colony, it was difllcult to locate. After dinner the editor was
wielding a cue in a pin pool game on Washington street,
when informed that a -warrant was out for him.
"Ah," he said, "and immediately -went into consultation
with several friends, one of whom announced later that the
brain of La Critica had decided to hunt bondsmen Immediate

The. police of this city are on the trail
of the soldier who shot and killed two

Augu.M 12. II" is with one of the regi
ments stationed at the Presidio and his
arrest is hourly expected. In order to
subservo the ends of Justice, The Call
for the present does not desire to men
tion his name. Several days ago a man
named Kuhn, who was in Denver when
the double tragedy was committed and
who saw the desperate soldier fire the
fatal shots, visited' the office of Captain
Bohen and informed him that the mueh
wanted assassin was In this city. HÂ«- said
that while w liking along Market street
he met him and. calling him by name,
started to speak to him. The soldier
pleaded with him not to mention that he
had seen him, and suddenly assuming a
menacing attitude, threatened to blow his
head off if he informed the police of his
presence here.

| panied by Kuhn they repaired to the Pre

! failed to locate their man.
I.,ist*!iigln word was again received at
headquarters to the effeci that the soldier
was In "Hilly" Abbott's Baloon on Dupont
street, near Bush. The detectives lost on
time in visiting the place, but by the time
they reached there the desperate mur
derer had flown. With the assistance of
the military authorities the police to-day
confidently expect to apprehend the Blayer
of the police officers.
The double '-rim.' for which thp soldier
is wanted was the killing of Officers T< m
<'lifford and \V. E. Griffith. The unfor
tunate officers had been summoned to
quell a disturbance in a saloon in Denver,
I and on repairing to the place they found
several recruits engaged in a row. The
â  policemen, after separating the com
â  batanta drove them out of the saloon.
The soldiers walked up the street for
some distance and started to renew their
quarrel. Officer Clifford followed them,
and as he was about to interfere one of
the soldiers drew a revolver and fired at
the policeman. The bullet struck him In
the breast and he died a lew minutes
later.

claimed that they had met him accident

HENRY HOLMES WILL BE
THE SYMPHONY LEADER
FRITZ SCHEEL'S SUCCESSOR.
THE musical cult of San Francisco is considerably excited over the news
which appeared over a week ago In The Call regarding the opening of
the symphony concerts on December 7 at the Grand Opera-house. Par
ticular Interest Is manifested in Henry Holmes, the new conductor, who
arrived in San Francisco some months ago and who, while in England, was
considered the leading violinist of the British empire. Inasmuch as he Is known
here only through his excellent solo work and chamber music quartet It would
be in place to refer to his European record. He is prominently mentioned In the
Cyclopedia of Music and Musicians and also In Grove's Dictionary of Music and
Musicians. Among other flattering references the following note may be found:
"For some years he has given an interesting series of chamber music concerts
under the title of 'Musical Evenings' and has held the post of professor of the
violin at the Royal College of Music since its foundation. A symphony entitled
'Boscastle' was given at one of the London symphony concerts in the spring
of 1&7."
As conductor he created the orchestra of the Royal College of Music. The
board of examiners for this orchestra consists of such men as Joachim, Tsaye,
Henschel, Saurel, Augustus Manns . and others. For several successive years
these authorities pronounced the orchestra as one of the best in Europe. The
English press speaks in the highest terms of Mr. Holmes' accomplishments and
his standing as an artist. Among the most valuable notices may be found the
following from the London Standard: "Henry Holmes' execution was masterly
In the extreme and proclaimed his title to be considered the best English violin
ist of the day." The Times speaks in the following terms of this eminent
musician: "Rarely has the work had a better rendering, and with such spirit
was the merry finale clashed off that an encore was demanded which the artist
had to return and grant. Mr. Holmes thus early secured the favor of an exi
gent public and It is to be hoped that the first appearance of our talented
countryman will not be the last."
With such credentials at his disposal Mr. Holmes ... should certainly prove <

USES OF THE
DEATHS OF TWO
PEOPLE MASKED
Embalmed Before the
Autopsy.
CORONER HILL IS INDIGNANT
CASES WILL BE BROUGHT TO
JUDICIAL NOTICE.
Evidences of Crime Destroyed by the
Embalming Fluid in the Case
of Mrs. Anderson â Man
slaughter Charged.
Because the undertakers in charge em
balmed the bodies of two persons who
were supposed to have died by violence
a widow may be unabre to collect dam
apes for the loss of her husband, and a
husband may In all likelihood escape
conviction for manslaughter.
The cases are those of William Finnic,
a Beafaring man, who was knocked down
by a Sutter-street car and who died a
few days later, and Mrs. G. Anderson,
who died a short time after having been
knocked down and jumped upon with
both feet by her husband, Alexander An
derson, in the City of Guttenberg saloon,
10 Steuart street, about ten days ago.
The undertakers had injected embalming
fluid into the bodies before the autopsy
surgeon of the Morgue had an opportun
ity of making the autopsy, and he could
not be positive as to the cause of death.
Coroner Hill said yesterday that he in
tended to call the attention of the Dis
trict Attorney to the matter in order that
an example might be made of the guilty
persons and that others might be deterred
from imitating their action.
"Shortly after I took office," said Coro
ner 11111 in an interview yesterday "I
sent a circular letter to all the under
takers yin town warning them against in
jecting with embalming fluid any bodies
betore the undertaker had received the
necessary permit. This is a very per
nicious habit and one that must be
stopped, and if there is no legislation to
prevent It the necessary legislation must
be enacted at once. .Embalming fluid con
tain* poison, and the fluid used in some
of the cases at present tans the tissues
and the organs of the human body so j
that it is impossible to detect whether a
person has been poisoned or has died
from injuries, the effect of the fluid being
to mask the cause of death.
".Mrs. Finnic, whose husband was run
over by a Sutter-street car, will be un- j
to obtain judgment against the com
pany for her husband's death, even as
suming' that the company was to blame.
I am going to consult my attorney at
once and have such action taken as will
prevent this abuse in future."
in the inquest on the body of Mrs. An
derson Sergeant of Police Brophy testified
that the saloon had a bad name and that
he bad repeatedly called Anderson's at
tention to the impropriety of his wife
sitting on the laps of sailors in the sa
loon while Anderson played the accor
dion for their amusement. Three wit
nesses testified that Anderson had
knocked down his wife inside the bar
and had jumped upon her abdomen, and
that when she arose blood was streaming
from her head. She took to her bed
a day or two later and a physician was
called in, but he left th>- ease, and Dr.
D. B. Plymire took charge. He found
symptoms of pneumonia and treated her
fi>r that disease. He had heard nothing
of the beating and kicking, and in his
opinion the woman had died from pneu
monia.
Anderson on his own behalf testified
that he was "fooling" with his wife and
that while she was attempting to strike
him with a cup he threw her from him
and she fell on the floor. He denied hav
ing struck or kicked her.
"On account of the body having been

not tell what she died of. It would be
impossible to determine. There were no
signs of bruises on the body."
The jury returned a verdict that the
sed had died of pneumonia follow
ing possible injuries. This the Coroner
refused to receive, on account of its
vagueness, and the jury, after further
consultation, returned a verdict that
death had boon caused by pneumonia.
The Coroner refused to accept it and is
sued a warrant for Anderson's arrest on
a charge of manslaughter. Anderson was
arrested immediately, but was allowed to
I attend his wife's funeral in charge of an
! officer.
In the matter of William Hogg, who
was booked as "John Doe" at the City
and County Hospital, notwithstanding
thai his name was on the books of the
City Receiving Hospital, whence he had
been taken, James Hagan, the city under
taker, testified that he had embalmed the
body by request of relatives of the de
ceased after having 1 disinterred it from
the potter's field, where it had been
buried last Saturday. The body had not
been pickled, he s;d.l. and he offered to
produce three witnesses to prove that he
buriÂ«-d and disinterred the body.
William Flnnie was another of the
bodies which the Croner had accused
Hagan of embalming without authority
and in opposltii n to the ends of justice.
Mr. Hagan, in explanation, swore that he
did not know that it was a Coroner's
case. The attending; physician signed a
certificate that Finnie's death was the
i result of an accident, and he remarked
I that he supposed he would have to get a
certificate from the Coroner. But as the
body was rapidly decomposing he in
jected about a quart of ejnbalming fluid
into the abdominal cavity.
Surgeon Zabala said that the embalm
ing fluid would have masked whatever
injuries might have been received by the
deceased; but he found the brain in a
mushy condition, and gave as the result
of his investigation that Finnic had died
of softening of the brain.
The jury returned a verdict that the
railroad accident was a contributory
cause of his death.
In the case of William Hopff thÂ«* jury
found that cerebral apoplexy was the
cause of death, "and we further find that
the evidence adduced at this hearing in
dicatea an entire lack of system at the
City Receiving- Hospital in* the transfer
uf patients to the City and County Hos
pital. Further, we are of the opinion
that the evidence Introduced as to the
disposition of the unknown d-earl at the
hands of tue city undertaker warrants
further investigation."
