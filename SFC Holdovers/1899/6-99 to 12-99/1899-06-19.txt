OTIS HAS
SERIOUSLY
BLUNDERED
Many More Troops Needed
Than Y\e Estimated to
Pacify Philippines.
WASHINGTON, June IS.â Presi
dent McKlnley now knows that
Major General Otis greatly un
derestimated the task that was
before him when he said he would need
but 10.000 troops to put down the Philip
pine Insurgents. He also knows from
â¢views with Governors and militia
officers of various States and from 1"'
ters which he has been receiving from
all over the country that he will have
the support of the country, if he de
rides to use the power given him by
Congress and send enough men to the
Philippines to make resistance by
Aguinaldo futile and bring the war to
an end at once.
One of the most influential members
of the Cabinet said to-day that dis
patches published this morning showed
the country was ready to support th %
pfepfdent with all the troops he might
need.
â It is the intention of the President."
paid he. "to use . â¢â !â >â¢ means in his
power to put down the rebellion In the
Philippines as promptly as possible.
Just before the President went away
this subject was frequently discussed
at the Cabinet meeting:, and there was
no conflict of opinion as to the best
policy to be pursued in the Philippines.
The President is determined to restore
peace and order throughout the islands
If it takes ten times as many troops as
we now have there. Ip to the present
time there has not been a word or sug
gestion from General Otis and ranking
officers of his command indicating the
force there is sufficient. The President
stands ready to call for as many volun
teers as may be necessary to subdue the
Filipinos, and there is every reason to
believe he can secure- without delay all
the volunteers he may call for. This Is
thÂ« true situation as far as the admin
istration is concerned, and it is unfair
and unjust to charge the President with
v.-ant of aggressiveness in dealing with
This subject."
Continuing the Cabinet officer said:
"You may say that the slightest inti
mation from General Otis that be
â¢wants more troops in addition to thri
he now has with him and those w'.-o
are to be sent to him under the recant
order will be followed by a prompt call
for volunteers. There will be no further
parleying with Aguinaldo and his fol
lowers, an no let up in the aggressive
campaign which General Otis is con
ducting."
Thus far the President has hesitated
to use the power conferred upon him by
Congress; to enlist : ' : --' "" volunteers, for
the reason that he fears such a course
would subject him to; criticism from
those who see a menace to free institu
tions in every additional man enlisted
in the army, and who would attribute
to him imperialistic motives if he
should increase the effective fighting
force of the country to 100,000 men.
There can be no reason for the Presi
dent to persist in his error longer. Re
cent events have shown that General
Otis has made a serious mistake in es
timating the strength and endurance of
Aguinaldo'B forces, and with few ex
ceptions the officers of the army on
duty in Washington are of the opinion
it would be â â 'â  serious blunder for the
administration to delay giving General
Otis substantial reinforcements just as
rapidly as the men can be sent out on
transports.
It would be a part of wisdom for the
President to act promptly in calling for
more troops and Bending General Otis
enough men to bring matters in the
Philippines to a conclusion in a few
weeks by administering to the Insur
gents a succession of crushing defeats.
Should he fall to do so he will be criti
cized in Congress for having embarked
in the Philippine war without any defi
nite policy and for having carried it on
with a force so inadequate as to lead
to the sacrifice of men and money when
congress had given him power to send
out a sufficient force to have closed it
up In a much shorter time. He will be
accused of purposely delaying a settle
ment of the Philippine situation so as
to keep it out of the hands of Congress
and perpetuate the military government
of the islands.
Advocates r,-f an energetic policy hope
the President will not delay longer, but
will tako measures at once to raise the
ps.

The town of Lorenzo Marquez, Deiagoa Bay. Portuguese South Africa, the seaport of the Transvaal country, where a formidable British squadron is re

WASHINGTON. June 18. â Because of the large number of Americans
and the value of their interests in the Transvaal, the administration
is closely watching developments In the controversy between that
country and Great Britain. There is no intention on the part of the United
States to Interfere In any way in the" dispute, and In case of trouble the
strictest neutrality will be undoubtedly observed. State Department offi
cials with whom I talked told me that Consul Stowe had not been sent to
the Transvaal for the purpose of advising Americana to remain neutral.
Several months api he was directed to make an inspection of consular offices
in South Africa, and it Is presumed he has been in the Transvaal on this
duty. State Department officials say that while Mr. Stowe has not been
given any official instructions, it would not be outside his authority to direct

yesterday (Saturday ) morning, accom

were expected to leave Berlin on their
return to The ' Hague this evening 1 .
On their return to The Hague thia

I Jf Emperor William refuses any sort

taken the liberty of pointing out the de

perhaps that will be the lever that will

CUBANS FLOCK
TO GET MONEY
Many Heard of Payment
by Accident.
Special I>ispatrh to The Call.
HAVANA, June 18.â The work of dis
bursing the American gratuity to the Cu
ban troops continues at Cardenas. Reme
dlos, Pinar dpi Rio and Puerto Principe.
The Cubans are flocking to the distribut
ing centers, asserting that it was only by
accident they heard they were to receive
American money. The palpable evidence
of fraud In making up the lists is arous
ing popular indignation throughout the
Island, and the evident desire of the
Americans to carry out their pledges ex
cites general admiration. The Cubans
saj that it is the first time in their his
tory when a Government promise had
been kept, and that they have never be
fore experh need such considerate tn-at
ment from Government representatl' 1
The papers that represent the members
of the former military Assembly continue
their disparaging allusions to Senor Que
sada, the special representative of Cuba
in Washington. They characterize the
appointment as a "direct slap in the
face'" from President McKlnley. The
Gomez party, on the other hand, say that
the President's choice in this matter Is
"another Illustration of his excellent
Judgment." They regard Senor Quesada
as a man devoted to the best Interests of
Cuba, and consider that this appointment
places in "Washington a man who will
tell the truth and saves the expense of
sending commissions there." which was
the usual device of the military Assem
bly.
The libel action which Governor Gen
eral Brooke has ordered begun against El
Reconcenrado is exciting general Inter
eat, for it is regarded as a test case un
der the present decree.
The possibility that General Freyre An
drade, president of the late military As
sembly, may be named as one of the
judges of appeal, has caused considerable
agitation among the Cubans, who regard
him as decidedly erratic. At the time of
the Garcia funeral his attitude toward
General Brooke, whom he charged with
endeavoring by every possible means to
provoke the Cubans, aroused considerable
animosity among the latter. More than
this, at all the meetings of the Assembly
he bitterly denounced the Americans,
and at all subsequent gatherings of Cu
bans where he has put in an appearance
he has followed the same course. His se
lection for a judgeship would be dis
approved by many not only for such
[derations as the foregoing, but' be
cause he is not old enough or sufficiently
experienced to fill the position effectively.

HAVANA'S POLICE
Mystery Veils Minnie
Ross' Death.
ONE SUSPECT IMPRISONED
| WEALTHY TAMPA MAN KEPT
INCOMTJNTCADO.
Theory Is Advanced That the Crime
Resulted From Blackmailing
Methods Pursued by
Officials.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
HAVANA, June IS.-The local papers;
to-day devote considerable space to the
murder of the notorious Minnie Ross, who
was killed with the blunt end of a hatchet
after having been choked and was found
dead early yesterday morning. It was
first reported that a well-known army of
ficer was involved by the uniform found
in the room of Fred Krauz, the suspect
now in custody, but the uniform undoubt
edly is one formerly worn by Krauz. He
is said to be a member of a wealthy
Tampa family. Thus far there is but lit
tle evidence against him. Many believe,
from the nature of the crime, that it was
committed by a woman. One theory Is
that the blow of the hatchet was not im
mediately fatal and that the victim was
then choked to death. Robbery could
scarcely have been ihe motive, for
the police found $2500 in the murdered wo
man's room and a quantity of valuable
jewelry on her dressing table.
Another theory is that the authorities,
having received definite Information that
the woman had been paying money to
some one connected with the Police De
partment for the privilege of conducting
her house, had sent an agent to ascertain
the name of the guilty official. This
agent, it is thought, had threatened that
unless she disclosed the man's mime her
house would be dosed. She, as this the
ory goes, refused to give it. despite the
protection of the blackmailer. The Gov
ernment agent left the house after mid
night, according to the explanation of the
crime, and il la supposed that she after
ward had an interview with the ' black
mailer With the result that he killed her.
The friends of Krauz bitterly complain
of the Ineomunloado system, which is
rigorously enforced in his case. Thus far
neither his friends nor legal counsel have
been allowed to see him.
SETTLING THE STRIKE
OF SMELTER MEN
Colorado Citizens' Committee Believes
the Trouble Soon Will Be
Adjusted.
DENVER, Juno is.â if the unanimous
opinion of the citizens' committee, which
includes ex-Governor Adams and Presi-
dent Jeffery of the Rio Grande Railway,
appointed by Mayor Johnson and Gov
ernor Thomas, in behalf of the city of
Denver and the State of Colorado to en
deavor to effect a settlement of trouble
j between smelter managers and their em-
S ployes, is a criterion, it Is only a mat
ter of a few days until the large
crp in this city and Pueblo, at least,
now closed on account of wage differ
ences, will be in operation. The commit
tee was in session the greater part of
this afternoon and went over the situa
tion In conjunction with four of the em
ployes from each of the Globe ajid Grant
smelters of this city.
It is said that it developed in the meet
ing that the matter of wages and hours
to be accordedto employes in the smelt
ers concerned In the lock-out has become
secondary to that of recognition of the
Smelter Employes' Union. The Employes'
Union is affiliated -with the Western Fed
eration of Miners, and it is said the board
of operators of the American Smelting
and Refining Company is averse to recog
nlzinffthe federation as having any rights
in disputes between the managers and
1 employes of a particular smelter. The
i members Â°f tnP citizens' committee gave
the following statement to the public:
"The committee has, according to its
best judgment, furthered the opening of
negotiations between the smelter mana
gers and their men, with a view to an
early resumption of work, and the com
mittee believes that progress has been
! made which, in a few days, may culmi
nate in the reopening of the smelters in
Denver and Pueblo. It is learned that the
president of the American Smelting and
Refinlnfi Company will probably arrive
in Denver next Wednesday, when a mu
tually satisfactory scale of wages may
be agreed upon between the managers
and the men. In the meantime the com
mittee will offer its services to help bring
about so desirable a result."
RICH COPPER ORE
ON CARBON RIVER
Deposits East of Tacoma to Be De
veloped on a Large
Scale.
TACOMA, June IS.â W. M. Darling of
Oakland, who recently bonded thirty-two
copper claims in the Carbon River district,
cast of Tacoma. is. here en route to New
York and Boston, where he will complete
arrangements for pushing development on
a large scale. He believes he has secured
control of property that will become an
other Anaconda. Ores from his claims
run from IS to 33 per cent copper, and
from $21 to $391 in gold, besides carrying
some silver. Some of the outcropping??
are on hillsides, where ore can be cheaply
mined. Several mining experts who have
examined the property declare its rich
ness to be wonderful.
A Boston syndicate has just arranged to
spend a large sum in developing copper j
properties on Gravtna Island, Southeast
ern Alaska, Here there are over 100,000
tons of ore in sight, averaging 13 per cent
copper and nearly $10 In gold and silver \
per ton. Several other copper properties !
are being developed in the Northwest, the j
high price of copper giving an impetas to
this branch of mining.
Cleveland Street Cars Idle.
CLEVELAND, June IS.â There were no
new developments in the strike of the
street railway men to-day, prineipafly
for the reason that the company made
no attempt to operate cars except on the
Euclid-avenue line. The police still af
ford ample protection, ana the cars were
run on schedule time from 7 o'clock in
the morning until 6 o'clock this evening.
It is expected that an attempt will be
made to-morrow morning to resume op
erations on some of the other lines, and
more trouble is looked for.

WASHINGTON. June 18.â Unless active duty is given to Major Gen
eral Joseph Wheeler before Congress convenes, that officer will resign his
commission and resume his seat in the House
General Wheeler's application for service in the Philippines has not
been withdrawn, and he is still hopeful that the President will see his

cials of the War Department, however, are opposed to the granting of
General Wheeler's request, for the reason, it is said, he will be com
pelled as a brigadier to serve under officers whom he ranked during the
Spanish war General Wheeler, however, feels that as he expects obedi
ence from his subordinates so would he give obedience to those who ire
his superiors. It is recalled that some weeks ago the President specially
organized the Department of Texas in order to provide General Wheeler
with a command, but that officer when it was offered to him declined on
the ground that he would prefer more active duty.
General Wheeler appreciates that if he resumes his seat in the House
he will be compelled to resign his commission in the army. Hlld while he
would regret to take sttch action he feels he can serve the country better
by serving in Congress than he would on waiting orders aa brigadier
general. He hopes before Congress convenes, however, the President will
-rant his application and send him to the Philippines, it is doubtful,
however, if the President will do so.

Calls a Bond Election.
RKDDING. June 18.- The city Board of
Education passed resolutions last night
to bond the city for $20,000 for the pur
chase of a site and the erection of a new
public school building. A special election
was called for July 15. The bonds will be
in denomination of JltiOO and will mature
at the rate of $2000 a year. They will bear
interest at the rate of 5 per cent. The
action of the board was prompted by the
necessity for more commodious quarters.
More than l"0 pupils could not be seated
last term. The public appears to favor a
new building, and it is thought the bonds
will carry by a big majority.

ing $50 cash bail. Three of them got off
the train at Larkspur and have not been

arrested will ever appear for trial, as the
names they gaveâ Frank Johnson and
James Carrollâ were evidently fictitious.
The charges placed against them were
battery and resisting an officer.

HOW TO GET A REFUTATION
Juggling with Statistics an ImpresÂ«-Â»
ive Way to Do It.
"Nothing like fake statistics for glv-Â«
; ing a fellow a reputation for scholar-*
ship dirt cheap," chuckled an astutÂ«
I citizen. "Statistics are the most Im-.
I pressive things in the world, and ther
beauty about 'em Is that nobod^- dares
to contradict you. I've been working
the scheme for several months, and my
stock has advanced about a thousand
1 points a day. How do I do it? Well,
! to illustrate the thing, I was standing
In a crowd on Canal street recently
watching the hip piledriver hammering
I down the walls for the drainage canal.
| 'Whole lot of power there.' remarked a
I gentleman at my elbow, as the weight
I came down, biff! "Immense," I replied,
j 'and. by the way, I was just making an
: interesting calculation in regard to it.
Do you know, sir, that blow is exactly
equal to 9562 carpenters driving ten
i penny nails into two-inch oak planks
i with four-pound steel hammers?' The
j man looked startled. 'You don't say
! so. professor?' he replied, respectfully,
| and presently I saw him whispering to
j the others, who sized me up with awe.
! The other day when it was raining I
joined a group under an awning. 'Bad
day,' said somebody. 'Yes,' I returned.
'I was amusing myself a few minutes
ago In figuring up the quantity off
water that has fellen in the city limit 3
between 6a. m. and noon.' At that the
other fellows got interested. 'How
much was it, doctor?' asked one oÂ£j
'em. 'Poured into a row of ordinary*
half-pint tumblers,' I said, impressive-,
ly, 'it would make a line once and two
fifths around the globe; it would fill
a thirteen-inch gun barrel reaching
from here to a point about nine milert
east of Copenhagen: it would quench
the matutinal thirst of 9.465.941 Ken
tucky colonels the day after Christ
mas: it would barely go into a tank
4562 kilometers long and 2411 millime
ters wide.' By Jove! You ought to
have seen those fellows' eyes stick out!
When they see me now they all touch
their hats. I squelched a smart Alec
at our boarding house by informing
him at the table that the pies consume*?
annually in New Orleans would form a
column, piled one above the other, pre
cisely 12,622 miles high. 'Oh! I admit
it leaves about sixteen pies over.' I
said, when he ventured a question, "but
that's only 3^ dekometers, and too
small to compute.' That settled him.
Now I'm the accepted authority of the
establishment on everything from
hash to hydraulics. I've found it a good
idea, by the way. to use the decimal
system whenever possible. It mixes
'em up when you begin to talk about
millimeters and hectometers>and gives
a fine flavor of learning to your re
marks. I never ran across a fellow
yet who dared to question a statement
in decimals. If I keep up this statis
tician racket until summer I wouldn't
be surprised if they offered me a chair
in one of the colleges." â New Orleans

Green Lights for Safety.
The New York. New Haven and Hart
ford Railroad has recently adopted an im
portant change in its night signals, and id
gradually putting it In operation on tho
various divisions of the road. It has al
ready taken effect In most of the eastern
divisions, but the Hartford division, of
which this is the terminus, has not yet
been Included. The change consists in \hf
use of green instead of white lights to de
note safety, and yellow instead of green
lights for caution. The regular red signal
is retained for a danger signal. The man
agement has been making a study of the,
question of night signals and has "adopted
this new system after a long series oi
experiments by experts. A green light i~i
easier seen at night than a white one. and
yellow la also said to be excellent for
night use. All the other roads in thls-part
of the country use what Is called itv
standard system, red for danger, white
for safety, green for caution. All roads
hereabouts use green glass in their switch
lamps.â Springiield (Mass.) Republican.

KING O'KEEFE MAY
LOSE HIS DOMAIN
Germany Likely to Buy
Yap Island.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
TACOMA, June 18.â According to mall
advices the belief exists at Hongkong
i that Germany will acquire Yap Island ami
four other inlets which David O'Keefe,
the copra king, has ruled over for years.
O'Keefe has long hoped that the United
States would take these islands and that
If America refused thÂ«-y would pass under
English control. Since It became known
at Hongkong that Germany was nego
tiating for the purchase of the Caroline
Islands from Spain it has been considered
settled that O'Keefe'a islands would be
included, since they In reality belong to
that group.
A story printed at Hongkong corrobo
rates a recent dispatch to the effect that
O'Keefe has made a big fortune in the
copra trade. When he settled at Yap he
married a native princess, who is a
shrewd woman and rules when he Is
away. The islands over which he rules
are his by right of discovery and th<
QUiesence of native rulers. They an.' dis
tant five days by steam from Manila.
Yap is surrounded by many minor islands,
among which figure Terang, Obipekel and
Dunij. It Is on Yap Island that O'Keefe
has built his royal residence. Here his
native wife rules supreme during his ab
seni â¢â  Bhowing her shrewdness and her
rbial animosity for all other Euro
peans. He employs hundreds of natives
to gather cocoanuts, which are shipped In
his steamer Santa Cruz to Hongkong and
thence to France, to be used in soap mak
ing. He also controls the island of St.
David, belonging to the Pelew group fur
ther south.
Corsica and the Vendetta
Persons who derive their ideas or Cor
sica as it is to-day from Prosper Meri
mt-c's novel. "Colomba," â¢will be doomed
to some disappointment. Manners und
customs have changed a great deal in tlio
island since the date, shortly after the
battle of Waterloo, when the gallant Brit
ish officer and his daughter visited Co
lomba in her ancestral castle at Pietra
nera. The vendetta, which is the theme
of that thrilling story, has greatly dimin
ished. During the carnival we fancied
that we had come upon a real instance
of this picturesque barbarism. One work
man killed another in a cafe, and then, in
the expressive Corsican phrase, "took to
the marquis." or brushwood, which covers
a large portion of the island, and has,
from time immemorial, been the refuge
of outlaws and bandits. This legend sub
sist.'! or some days, and excited a new
Interest In life in Corsica, ami quite a
Large demand for copies of "Colomba."
Hut a conversation which I had with the
juge d' instruction, who had investigated!
the case, proved that it was, after all. as
he expressed it. a crime vulgairo, and
9 we had hoped, a crime corse.
\V. afterward had the satisfaction of
Beeeing the malefactor led in chains be
tween two mounted policemen on his way
into Ajaccio. whereas the traditional ban
dit would have been fed and supplied
with powder and Phot by the country peo
ple, who would have rather gone to the
Btake than betrayed his hiding place to
the authorities. Here and there vendetta
may still linger in the island, but it has
now become a means of attracting the
touript. who is invited to buy bloodthirsty
looking knives and daggers, bearing such
choice inscriptions as: Vendetta Corsa;
morte al nemieo ("death to the enemy");
or, even still more gruesome: Va diritto
nl cuore del nemlco ("go stright to the
heart of the enemy"). These choice weap
3ns form, together with gourds engraved
with portraits of Napoleon, or the negro's
head, which is the Corsican crest, tha

THE SA:N FRANCISCO CALL., MONDAY, JUNE 19, 1899.
VISITS MOUNT
HOLYOKE COLLEGE
The Students Greeted
President McKinley.
Sl>eclal Dispatch to The Call.
HOLTOKE, Mass., June IS.â Sunday for
the President was anything but the day
â  :" rest that was hoped for. The contin
ual crowding of the curious citizens, the
Immense Jam at the church this morning
long and tiresome for all. The President
totally unprepared for reception in con
nection with the Baccalaureate exercises
at Mount Holyoke College, made the day
long and tiresome for all. The President
was nut content with going once to
church, but went twice, leaving Mrs. Mc-
Kinley in the hands of her lady friends
on each occasion.
At 3 o'clock the palace electric car
Rock Rimmon was taken and the party,
Including all the ladles, were taken over
the trolley line to South Hadley to attend
the Baccalaureate exercises at the chapel
of Mount Holyoke College, where on
Tuesday the President Is to share honors
with Governor Roger Walcott and deliver
the degree to the graduating class, of
which his niece, Mis.s Grace McKinley, is
a member.
As the seniors marched into the pretty
little chapel this afternoon just before the
arrival of the President they made a very
pretty picture, each clad in cap and gown.
They took front seats in the center, while
President McKinley and the gentlemen of
his party occupied seats on the. side. The
ladies, including Mrs. McKinley, decided
that the nay was too warm for them to
enter the crowded building, bo they were
driven to the residence or Byron Smith,
near by, and there they had a light lunch
eon and at the close of the exercises
rejoined the gentlemen at the special car.
In the chapel hundreds of young women
filled the auditorium, while the balcony
was occupied by several hundred hi^n
school girls in bright dresses. After tlie
President had been introduced by Mrs. E.
ri. Mead, the president of the college, he
entered the chapel, the congregation re
maining standing until he had taken his
seat. A musical programme and prayer
precedi d Kcv. Dr. Jacobus' baccalaureate
sermon. At the close of the exercises tho
President and Mr. Whiting walked to the
residence of Mr. Smith ami together with
the ladles were taken back to the special
car which stood in front of the chapel,
surrounded by a large, number of the col
lege girls, who had been dismissed from
s< rvices, and a multitude of the towns
people. Miss Grace McKinley was among
them, and later introduced some of her
schoolmates.
The reception which awaited the visitors
as they alighted and entered the car was
so spontaneous and of such a friendly
and cordial nature that at Mrs. McKin
ley's ie<juest the President ordered the
car to delay Its departure for a few mo
ments while ( he shook the hands of the
people who clustered about the window
where the couple were seated. Mr. Mc-
Kinley leaned from the car window and
shook hands with the people and spoke a
few words of greeting to each.
Mrs. McKinley all the while smiled and
kis^'d her hand or waved her handker
chief to thÂ© crowd.

JAP PLAYERS
PRESENT THEIR
NATIVE DRAMA
Striking Stage Pic
tures and Costumes.
BUT THE ACTION DRAGS;
GALLERY CROWDED BY SYMPA
THETIC ORIENTALS.
Japanese Pathos, It Seems, Is Ex
pressed by a System,
of Noisy Snuf
fles.
In the California Theater last night
Mr. Otto Kawakami and Madame
Yacco and "their company of rising
Japanese actors and actresses" appear
ed for the first time in America, in no
less than four different pieces. At first
sight and sound the native Japanese
drama is rather a difficult problem. Its
tragedy does not make a serious dent
in the American auditor, and its com
edy does not strike him as the most
joyous thing in the world. The Japan
ese actor, one finds, expresses pathos
through his nose; heroics, in blind
staggers; and humor in acrobatic flip
flaps. He snuffles when he is saddest.
LEADING LADY and Climax in the Japanese Play.
1 And as there was a groat deal of sad
j ness in the first two pieces presented
! last night, there was a deal of snuf
fling.
Our Japanese townsfolk filled the gal
lery and seemed to find delight in these
nasal specialties, but the people down
stairs didn't appear to know just how
| to take them.
The plays are childishly primitive,
and with the aid of the "arguments"
printed in the programme, quite in
telligible. The first one, "The Duel,"
displays beautiful scenery and cos
tumes and a diverting sword fight.
The second, "Kusunoki," is full of
fights, during which the actors employ
themselves in many realistic tumbles
from a pile of stage rocks pome fifteen
feet in height. Hypnotism also seems to
have a place in this piece, as one no
tices that many Japs fall down van
quished at the mere glance of the hot
eyed hero.
The most interesting in plot is "The
Temple of Dojoji," which is built
around the Japanese legend of the bell
In which the lovers hide and are cre
mated by the jealous woman's wrath.
In this Madame Yacco, who imperson
ates the vengeful rival, executes a
! dance that is full of unique steps and
poses. The performance closes with
what is archly entitled "Dewey Day
Celebration on the Pine-Fringed Shores
of Miho." Here the Geisha dances are
introduced with pleasing result. An
other diversion that comes earlier In the
programme is a song, accompanied by
I the characteristic Japanese instrument,
the shamisen. The song itself is long
voiced falsetto and painful to the ears,
but the accompaniment is interesting
from a technical standpoint at least.
Cut to practical proportions, this
, Japanese show ought to have a curious
| interest for all playgoers. But in its
present shape the Jap auditors seem to
have most of the fun. As a picture it
is well worth taking in, the scenery is
striking and the costumes are splendid.
It is quite like an Japanese
screen. ASHTON STEVENS.
Artificial Indigo From Coal Tar.
Coal tar has yet another conquest to
record. It threatens to supplant the
indigo plant of India and Java by sup
plying an indigo chemically identical
with and infinitely purer than that
hitherto on the market.
As long ago as 1882 a German chemist.
Dr. A. yon Baeyers, discovered Bevera]
methods of obtaining indigo blue from
cir.namic acid and bitter almond oil,
which themselves are a product of coal
tar, but all were too costly for commer
cial purposes.
Other chemists took up the work
where Baeyers had loft it, and after
years of toil It was announced eighteen
months ago that the Baden Aniline and
Soda Works, at Ludwigshafen. on the
Rhine, were in a position to supply in
digo obtained by an improvement of
the process discovered by Dr. Baeyers,
and at a price low enough to compote
with natural indigo.
The raw material for the new pro
duct is naphthaline, a constituent part
of coal tar, known to the public as an
excellent remedy against moths, etc.,
and which, by a series of elaborate
operations, is converted into indigo
blue. The factory has gradually in
creased its producing powers and hopes
soon to be able to export to other in
digo-using countries.
It may be mentioned that Germany
already supplies 70 per cent of the
world's consumption of dyestuff from,
coal tar. â London Mail.
The Larynx.
The larynx has been compared to a
wind, a reed and a stringed instrument.
The comparison of it to a violin gave rise
to the not very accurate phrase "vocal
cords," as the name of the two cushions
which are its most prominent features.
But no string so short as those "vocal
cords" could produce a musical bass note.
In fact, the comparison of the larynx to
a-ny instrument which produces only mu
sical notes is inadequate, to begin with.
There is no instrument but the larynx
which produces both song and speech, and
as those comparisons view the larynx
merely as a producer of musical sounds,
we have no further concern with them at
present. Besides, the voice can be trained
for speech, elocution and oratory without
a knowledge of the physiology of the
larynx.
We have the power of adjusting the
larynx, of varying the tension of its cords,
cushions or ligaments, as they have been
variously called. We can do "these things
without scientific technical knowledge of
how they are done, without any knowl
edge at all of vocal physiology; and it is
the work of the trainer of the voice to
teach his pupils â or her pupils we may be
allowed to sayâ how to do them.âCham
bers' Journal.
Wild Guinea Fowl.
The wild guinea ben is a new same In a
part of the Ozark country. This fowl is
nothing more than the small blue domes
tic guinea hen grown wild. The guinea
hen is a shy creature at all times and
shows a constant tendency to return to
a state of nature. The fowl is especially
timid about nesting time, and often goes
far into the woods to lay its eggs. In
this way broods are frequently raised
away from the farm home and grow up
almost as wild sis is the untamed turkey.
In killing wild guinea hens hunters have
j discovered that these fleet-footed and
: swift-winged birds make excellent sport,
j and now some sections of the country
i aro well stocked with tFfis game. The
j guinea hen is very prolific and will hatch
; forty or fifty chicks in a season. The
! young are hardy creatures, and thrive
| well on such wild fond as they pick up
jin tho fields and woods. The wild guinea
! hen is more difficult to hunt than is the
! turkey, as it flies more swiftly and eludes
a <I'">Â£ with keener instinct.â Chicago Kec

Sold His Seven-Year-Old Boy.
George Vm:k, a laborer, whose wife is
dead, living in Manitowoo, Wis., has sold
his 7-year-old boy George to two Italian
women and one man. The Italians were
hoarding with Vnuk during their stay in
the city, and on Sunday nights they drank
and caroused all night. Vnuk was drunk,
it is thought, when ho made the bargain.
The exact sum of money he got for the
child Is not known, as he was so drunk.
The Italians left on Monday, buying tick
ets for Green Bay over the Chicago
Northwestern. Tho boy did not want to
go, but was forced to by the Italians. The
father usod to work in a brewery. Of
ficers of the Humane Society and police

of his dead wife are pushing his prosecu
tion. It is thought that the child will be
recovered.â Chicago Tribune.
Why Women Hunt Bargains.
"I am a little weary of hearing the cry
that Is always being raised by man to
the effect that women spend too much
time in 'shopping.' 'gadding around from
store . to store,' 'hunting bargains,' and
the like, says a writer who knows, in the
New York Herald.
Why do they do it?
In nineteen cases out of twenty, to save
money.
Whoso money?
Why, his money, of course!
1 don't think there's a woman living
who wouldn't be glad of the opportunity
to go into a tine establishment and order
what she liked without regard to the
nerve racking question of cost.
Women generally have to account for
thoir money.
Men don't.
Just Imagine a man bunting around to
find aa good a clear for less money than
tho Hoffman or Waldorf ohargo? Fancy
his Faying to a restaurant keeper:
"Your dinner monu lWks pood, but I
must see if 1 can't find just as excellent
a little cheaper."
Not he!
He'll get the best If It takes all that hÂ«
has.
But women mustn't rto that!
Light Your Cigar Only Once.
The shoulders of our Lady Nicotine need
be broad to carry all that is laid upon
them by the heretic. Here is the very
latest thing. A man had smoked twenty
clgarb a day for twenty years, when lie
came to a painful end. That he did so
was straightway ascribed to his inordi
nate consumption of tobacco. But this
man was a Frenchman. To begin with,
therefore, he may have smoked the
twenty cigars per diem for twenty years
and yet not have smoked any inordinate
amount of tobacco. Anyhow, they would
not have produced phossy jaw, and
phossy jaw was one of the peculiarities
attending this particular demise. Investi
gation established the fact that, though
deceased had smoked many cigars, he had
not smoked them well. Pie was always
letting them go out and relighting them
with the match of hip country. He must
have used some millions of such matches.
A lurid light is thro, n upon his fate and
upon the method of the anti-tobacconist.â

Oriental Ethics.
The Sultan's eighteenth wife bade her
importunate lover to be patient; she
would not listen to any proposal to steal
her away forthwith.
"I was purchased on the installment

ises before I'm paid for!"

UNKNOWN MAN
DROWNED IN
OAKLAND CREEK
Three Men Fall Out of
a Small Boat.
PROMPT HELP SAVES TWO
YACHTSMEN PLAY THE PART OF
LIFE-SAVERS.
The Rescued Men Know Nothing of
Their Unfortunate Companion,
Whose Identity Remains
a Mystery.
"Pete, Pete! save me!" With these de
spairing words upon his lips, the last he
was ever heard to utter, an unknown man
sank yesterday morning about 1 o'clock
Into the waters of Oakland Creek near
the California Yacht Club house. The
man upon whom he called for aid was
Pete Smith, who sailed over from Sausa
llto on Saturday afternoon in the sloop
yacht Thetis in response to Commodore
A. M. Clay's invitation to the San Fran
cisco and Corinthian yachtsmen to ren
dezvous in San Antonio estuary. But Pete
Smith does not know the man's name, al
though he remembers his face.
Toward 1 o'clock on Saturday the un
known, who is described as smooth
faced, dark complexioned and about 2.i
or 26 years of age, wearing a black hat
and a gTay overcoat, asked Charlie, the
boatkeeper of the California Club, t:> ferry
him across the creek to the Oakland side.'
He had been present at the jinks given
in the clubhouse, and wished to go into
Oakland to get a room for the night.
Charlie consented, and left the clubhouse
to get a boat ready; but when he looked
around for the young man he was not to
be seen. Soon afterward Charlie saw him
start from the float with two young men |
named G. A. Craig and C. S. Moore, and
observed that they did not directly cross
the creek. Instead, they proceeded down
the line of yachts until they came nearly
to where R. S. Rridgman and F. M. Well
man's sloop yacht Thetis was moored.
At a few minutes after 1 o'clock Dr. T. L.
Hill and three others, who were playing
whist on board the yacht Cvgnus. heard
a cry of "Man overboard!" Dr. Hill soon
had "his small boat ready, and. making for
the scene of the disaster, discovered a
yawl capsized and two men in the water.
One of tnese he rescued, and J. R. Savory
of the sloop Juanita rescued the other.
They turned out to be G. A. Craig an^ C.
S. Moore of the sloop Thetis. Tnoy tola
their rescuers that a companion "was with
them in the yawl, and a hat was seen on
the water, but no man could be found, al
though the small boats of other yachts
rowed all over the scene of the disaster.
Long after all hope of rescuing the un
known man had ceased. E. C. Bartlett of
the yawl Frolic and recording secretary
of the San Francisco Yacht Club and
friends rowed up and down, using grap
pling irons in the hope of finding the
body. All their efforts yielded no result.
No one seemed to have any personal ac
quaintance with the unknown, and even
Pete Smith to whom his last words were
addressed, could shed no light upon his
Identity. Later in the day vague rumors
were heard that the name of the un
known was Seabrooke, Seabury or See
burg, and that he was either a football
player himself or had friends among the
football men. But none of th.e?e rumors
could be verified, and the identity of the
drowned man remains a mystery.
How a seaworthy yacht's yawl, in
â which earlier in the evening six men had
safely traveled, came to capsize on a
calm night in smooth water is almost
equally mysterious. The two men who
were rescued from a watery grave by
the prompt action of Dr. T. L. Hill and J.
R. Savory had no explanation tr> offer; all
they knew was that three men had start
ed but from the clubhouse, and that only
two were picked up out of the water.
The disaster cannot be attributed to a
strong tide, for the tides do not run very
strongly out of the creek, and at 1 o'clock
yfste'rd"ay morning it was about slack
water. __^

confidential adviser, "the Bashaw of Ala

are each offering me the other's head as a
gracious gift. What shall I d,o?"

years past. Xone of the staples show any marked
weakness, mid all of the important one- are firm.
The demand for iron keeps up to the fever point,
some of it is speculative and would cease with
a decline. The starting up of many new furnaces has
set large buyers thinking, and it is now thought that
ere long tlio production will overtake the consump
tion, hence the heaviest purchasers are not taking any
thing for next year. The present production is the
greatest ever known in this or any other country,
1 <ing 256,062 tons for the first week in June, against
2.-.0.000 for the first week in May. The market con
rnucs very stiff at the recent advances; so stiff, in
peed, that the usual 2 per cent discount on cash pay
â¢ for nails has been stopped.
Woolens continue firm at a further advance in sev
eral descriptions, but buyers have been so accustomed
to cheap values that it is hard to educate them up to
the advance. Cotton does not respond to reports of
decreased acreage and other firm conditions, and re
mains unchanged.
Financial conditions stand about the Â«me. Ex
ports cf gold nave cauÂ«ed no stir, being recognized
as mere borrowings by foreign bankers. Our foreign
trade continues to show a large balance in our favor,
y exports being $23,000,000 larger than the im
ports, while for eleven months the increase in excess
of exports reaches the enormous total of $405,000,000.
There is no longer any fear of what may happen if

that $260,000,000 of them have already been re

small to cut any figure.
On this coast the conditions remain practically un
changed. Wheat has hardened somewhat in sympathy
with Chicago, but the market is mulish in the face

luctantly. The California!! crop will not he as large as
expected a few weeks ago, hut an immense yield of
barley is looked for. and the latter cereal is weak in
consequence. Hay has hren rising gradually during
the past week, but the appreciation is slieht. The de

dealers expect the market to be cleaned up by the
first of August. There is an active inquiry also for
new hops, but the growers are firm in their views
r:id are not disposed to write any contracts at current
quotations. Provisions are selling of? well, and sev

sheep and hogs are still in light supply and bringing
unusually good prices. The demand for merchandise
keeps up and the exporting merchants are busy.
Lumber rules firm at the recent advance, with a

Briefly, we are doing a first-class all-round business,
The predictions made last spring that California would

way to be verified.
THE BALLOT-BOX REMEDY.
*"l "HE ('ALL does not question the good faith of ;
| the present Grand Jury in its investigation of
the alleged corruption of Supervisors. But it
' seriously doubts whether the inquiry will have any
practical and useful results. It is very rarely the
actual legal proof of bribery can be obtained, and
the failures of legislative committees and grand juries
to bring corrupt miscreants to justice are often used
to show that charges against public officers in the
press i ewhere are groundless and are invented
for sensational purp
In realit} such charges are almost invariably true,
but, although unerring inferences from established'
facts, the) are usually beyond the reach of the courts. ;
1 The subtleties of political corruption are very intricate
! and very deep. The agents used by the railroad mon
! opoly and by other conspirators against popular rights
to coi â  sen nts are masters of their busi
i i ss and operate in ways which, though they can be
m derstood, it is most difficult to penetrate. Amanwho
would give or take a bribe would ordinarily commit
perjury to conceal the fact. But legislators, Super
visors and other officials are often purchased and'
to aci in total disregard of their obligations'
without the direct receipt of money. The distribution
of patronage, the operation of which is now being
I by the heavenly twins known as Burns
and Gage, is a potent agency in the accomplishment
i nds. The results can be seen, the
necessary connections accurately di cerned, but the
interior mystery cannot be successfully unraveled.
It may ]â¢â ? often noticed that, about the time of the
' consummation of some transparent rascality, the in
dividuals who do the external work have an inex
Â»e of prosperity. Mortgages are lifted.
Additional capital is obtained for business enter
prises. Profitable contracts are awarded. The va
rious means employed to reach an<l to compensate
ial dishonesty are not even effectually concealed,
and yet they cannot be definitely traced. An expe
ed lawyer, especially in a railroad case, is often
distinctly aware that a jury has been put up against
him, and yet. although he can put his finger upon the !
very men who <i : '! the job, he could not sustain a
â  mlated eh; i -; them.
It is their inscrutability that makes corruptionists
They do their contaminating work
and abs ilutelj the faces of respectable citi
zens, because they arc impervious to odium and they
: are satisfied that they cannot be judicially punished.
: Bui a vigilant press and an observing public are not
deceived. Their proof may be moral as distinguished
from legal, but it produces certainty. No legislator
1 or Supervisor who can be handled for dishonest pur
poses escapes observation, and an honest Supervisor
cted. There is very
little injustii c done to public officers. If they walk
1 straight they . n to be appreciated and re
spected.
San Francisco, it is well known, f <-r many years
ha^ been the victim of saturated villainies. The Hun
ton monopoly, with its innumerable ramifications,
may be tl but it is nol the only source of
municipal corruption. The effective remedy is not
through Grand Jury investigations that sound well
and accomplish nothing, but at the primaries and at
the polls. Respectable and intelligent citizens, who
understand the situation and are ready to perform
their civic duties, can take and hold possession of
their party organizations. This proposition is es
â â¢" the Republican party. The thorough
bred and clean Republicans of San Francisco can
sweep Dan Burn 1 ;, the railroad push and other rotten
rty into the sea. The opportunity
for a demonstration of their strength and their de
y will soon be afforded, and there is a reasonable 1
ect that it will lie effectually improved.
THE DEWEY MONUMENT.
\ J TTII subscriptions received from compara
\A/ tively few persqns but amounting in the ag
gregate to more than $30,000, now in their
hands, th mmittees engaged in raising hinds
for the erection of the monument by which San Fran
i cisco 1- to commemorate the gratitude of this genera
; tion to Admiral Dewey for his epoch-making victory
in Manila Hay may well be satisfied with what has
been thus far accomplished and sanguine of the speedy
subscription of the entire amount needed for the work.
Up to this time the general public hn.s hardly been
appealed to. The subscriptions that make up the fund
at pVesent have been given in large amounts. From
this time on, however, the great mass of the people
' will add their contributions to the fund, and while
most of them will, of course, be small in comparison
1 with the munifit eni sums given to start the movement,
they will in the aggregate exceed the sum total of
', the large subscriptions and make the monument an
expres nof the sentiment of the whole people and
not that of a few wealthy men.
The battle of Manila was so essentially a victory
] that establishes the prestige of the United States in the
Pacific Ocean, that it gives to the Pacific Coast States
s new position in the Union. This is no longer the
! bacl the republic. The great commercial
I energies of the country will have their future develop
! ment through San Francisco and other Pacific Ocean
ports and it would not be easy to exaggerate the ex
tent and the magnitude of the commerce which those
I energies will eventually accomplish.
It is, therefore, right and fitting there should be
erected in this city a monument which will represent
the appreciation of the people of the Pacific Coast of
I Dewey's great service. For that reason the appeal
! for subscriptions to the monument finds a ready and
â  cordial response from all patriotic citizens. As the
spirit of national loyalty stirs more strongly in the
popular heart at the approach of the great national
j holiday of the Fourth of July, the appreciation of the
j mighty victory of the great admiral will increase, and
it is fair to assume that by the time that day arrives
I the $100,000 required for the construction of the monu
j ment will be virtually assured.
EDUCATION IN ALASKA
ASCAXDAL in the Department of Public
Education is about the last thing that was ex
pected in news from Alaska, and yet that is what
: has come to us in the report of the Grand Jury of the
United States District Court for that Territory. Jt
is rich a scandal as could be found in the most
civilized of home districts and has more than the fa
miliar complaint of a waste of public money.
Congress, it seems, has appropriated, between
[884 and ISO 7. as much as $415,000 for Alaskan
schools, and the Grand Jury, taking a scrutinizing sur
vey of the whole wide domain of iceberg, glacier and
I gold fields, finds no sufficient return for the money.
The schools are not only few and far between, but the
very existence of some reported is doubtful. They are
! out of sight from any point of view the Grand Jury
: could find, and accordingly the members of that body
have concluded if there be such schools they have
j been established not for the youth of the "advance
guard of civilization" in the Territory, but for the
: barbarian offspring of those who "By day catch the
j ermine, and by night chase other vermin."
The waste of school money and the bad location of
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, JUNE 19, 1899.
j schools are by no means the only offenses charged
; against the offending Superintendent. He seems in
, deed to be a man with a frozen gall, capable of ven
turing upon the most extraordinary schemes without
getting cold feet. He is accused of promoting
a wild plan "for revolutionizing the mode of travel
and transportation of mails in Alaska by the intro
duction of domesticated reindeer from Siberia," of
having demoralized the educational system of the
, Territory by neglect of duty, and of having "per
sistently embodied" in his official reports "that which
1 he knew to be false."
From the arraignment it will be seen the Alaskan
School Superintendent has gone far beyond anything
' ever perpetrated by school authorities in this climate.
We have known school money to be wasted, school
dignitaries to neglect their duties, school reports to j
contain false statements; but no attempt has ever been |
made here to introduce reindeer, or to effect any other
kind of revolution in our civilization.
It is not easy to understand the bitterness with
which the reindeer scheme is denounced. Indeed,
from this end of the line the Alaskan mail service has >
seemed to be so abominable, it is the conviction that
1 anything in the way of a revolution would benefit it.
! However, we have not had experience, while the \
Alaskans have, and our judgments must give way to ;
theirs.
The report concludes with this heartfelt outburst:
"The Grand Jury, therefore, earnestly protests
against any further recommendation for the importa
tion of domesticated reindeer, and respectfully begs |
and prays on behalf of a long-suffering people that !
the honorable Secretary of the Interior may in his j
wisdom see fit to relieve Alaska of the incubus of an j
I official who enjoys neither the respect nor the con
fidence of any considerable portion of her people,
white or native, and whose days of usefulness, so far
as Alaska is concerned, were long since buried. '
So ends the first chapter of the schools' scandals j
of Alaska, and so begins the introduction of the rein- j
deer into American politics as a revolutionary
creature.
WHITE LABOR IN HAWAII.
A REPORT from Hawaii announces that the
Supreme Court of the islands has just handed
down a decision in the case of two white men
who undertook to escape from the bondage of con
tract labor on the plantations, but were arrested, con
victed and confined in jail upon failure to pay the fine
imposed.
The decision affirms the action of the lower court
in convicting and imprisoning the men, and declares
the provisions of the Constitution of the United
State-, cited in defense of the laborers, are not in
force in Hawaii during the present transition period.
This upholds the validity of the penal clause in the
contract labor laws in Hawaii, and consequently un
til Congress establishes freedom there, we are to have
virtual slavery in a Territory of the United States.
It is significant that the same report that brings
news of this decision adds:
"The importation of Italians as laborers upon some
plantations is now definitely decided upon. A num
ber of managers have made application for this class |
of people, and they will almost certainly form a part â 
of our population in the course of a few months."
While the report speaks of Italian laborers only, it
is safe to say the planters in their eagerness to get
workingmen under penal contracts upon their planta
tions will be ready to take Americans as well as for
eigners if they can get them. Efforts may be made
in this city to induce unemployed men to go to the
islands, and it will be well for workingmen, there
fore, tn give heed to this decision of the court.
Labor in Hawaii is very likely to mean slavery for
an indefinite period. The Hawaiian lobby was strong
enough to prevent the passage of an act providing a
permanent government for Hawaii last winter, and it
may be able to postpone it for another year. Until
that question is settled the workingman who goes
to our "Paradise of the Pacific" had better be careful
what sort of contract he signs.
Explosions of powder factories nn this coast are
altogether too frequent. Similar establishments in
the East rarely suffer from such disasters, and there
is evidently a lack of care in our factories. It is even
probable that if they undertook to manufacture so
harmless a mixture as baking powder the stuff would
get away and raise the roof inside of a month.
The Hawaiian labor problem threatens to become
something like the old slave labor question, on a
smaller scale, of course, but just about a? offensive in
its nature; and Congress is going to have a lively
â¢time in solving it. It is evident that whenever a
country in the temperate zone annexes a tropical
island it annexes trouble.
Seventeen Governors of as many States have prom
i ised to attend the Anti-Trust Congress at St. Louis.
It is safe to say that, if the Executive of Xorth Caro
lina repeats too often his famous remark to the Gov
! ernor of South Carolina, the delegates may be forced,
in self-defense, to resolve themselves into an anti-tick
convention.
The frank announcement of the German delegates
to the Peace Conference that Germany will oppose
j any proposal for disarmament inclines to the belief
that the Kaiser was slightly sarcastic when he ex-
I pressed his imperial desire that the results of the con
i ferencc would be "satisfactory to the Czar."
Mr. Lockwood is mistaken when he says, "If you
â  have got to be robbed it does not matter whether you
â  are held up by Dick Turpin with a pistol or by John
Rockefeller with a railroad." He forgets that Rocke
feller would undoubtedly say grace before making
! meat of you.
The "man with the ax" seems just now to be
monopolizing general interest in Alameda County to
the exclusion of "The Man With the Hoe." Poet
Markham, however, can console himself with the re
flection that a prophet is without honor in his own
country.
It is now said a combine will be organized in New
York to oppose the tinplate trust, and it is to be
hoped the report is correct. A battle between a
combine and a trust would be watched with as much
interest as a fight between a crocodile and a hip
popotamus.
The report that the story of the assassination of
Luna may be a Filipino hoax raises a suspicion that
the whole Luna record may be a fake. Our boys in
Manila have been hunting for him for a long time / but
j have never succeeded in finding him.
It is really surprising to what an extent the people
believe that prizefighters are spendthrifts. In the very
nature of their calling they can be nothing but close
fisted.
If MM. Charron and Winton do not cease expend
ing wind about"that automobile race there will not be
enough left for their tires.
General Otis seems to find it about as hard to
"grasp the situation" as to catch the Filipino.
CONCERNING THE STATE'S
MINING INDUSTRY
The things of most present Importance
concerning the rapid growth and progress
of the California Miners' Association
are the Southern California branch of the
association, organized a few days ago
at Los Angeles, with Stephen M. White
as president, and the mistaken hostility
to the organization which has for some
weeks been expressed repeatedly by news
and technical journals and a few mining
men of that region.
This new organization was effected
about six weeks ago in Los Angeles at nn
open meeting attended by Secretary E. H.
Benjamin, Attorney General Ford, ben
ator Davis, E. H. Ricketts, Charles B.
Yale and others of the California Miners
Association. The new society, supposed
to represent the interests of Southern Cal
ifornia in the association, has been sup
ported by a number of the leading min
ing men in that part of the State, and ha*
already acquired a considerable member
ship in spite of the hostile arguments
from some sources that an independent
organization would be much better. This
hostility on the part of some men and in
fluences interested in the mining prosper
ity of Southern California Is certainly a
mistaken one that will not help the min
ing industry south of Tehachapi, which
has never before specially figured in the
work of this powerful State organization.
Those who have objected with many
words to the affiliation with the Califor
nia Miners' Assocaition say. in effect,
first, that the fields and their interests
are naturally separate: second, that the
California Miners' Association is controll
ed by San Francisco business men, who
use the organization to divert the mining
trade to and control it from San Fran
cisco; third, that Central and Northern
California put little men or money into
Southern California mim>s. and that the
importance of th<* industry south of re
hachapi is not recognizf-d up here. It has
been said that "the bay people do not
give fair and adequate consideration to
the mining interests of Southern Califor
nia; that bay capital cannot be interested
In S<uithern*California mines; that Los
Angeles is interested in building up a
mining trade that would be best fostered
by an Independent organization; that
Southern California mining opportunities
can be better advertised by a separate or
ganization; that the California Miners
Association is chiefly seeking the 75 per
cent of the membership dues which have
been fixed at $2 per year for individuals,
The urging of these things In the col
umns of news and technical journals and
from meeting platforms has hindered the
growth of what promised to be a strong
and effective auxiliary association. It is
another exhibition of the feeling of inde
pendence of the rest of the State that
bobs up now and then down there.
To pay that the mining Interests of Cali
fornia are split Into two parts by a rangre
of mountana is to take a narrow and er
roneous view of the California Miners'
Association. The State association is
made up of fourteen county organizations,
and the association has never since its or
ganization, seven years ago, either in an
nual convention or through its executive
or other committees, dealt with matters
of sectional interest, except in the great
matter of the rehabilitation of hydraulic
mining. This question gave the associa
tion its birth, and the Caminetti law gave
evidence Of its power and effectiveness,
but since then this matter has been an
incidental one. This association gave
birth to the pending demand for a cabi
net department representing the mining
industry, and it still hammers away at
the plan, helping give it needed boom and
prestige. Southern California is as much
interested in this as any other part of
the State or country, as it is in the min
eral lands bill, to which the association
gave birth and the bright prospects of
which are to be credited largely to the
insistent work of the association, largely
dime through A. 11. Ricketts. The revision
of the Federal mining law is another Held
of its labor not peculiar to the interests
<if any section. A number of such mat
ters of equal interest to miners in t'tah.
Arizona, Southern and Northern Califor
nia have been taken tip by the association
ami await the added support of the
Southern California mining interests.
Tn matters of State legislation the asso
ciation has been an effective force and
will continue to be one. The Legislature
has in the main acceded to its recom
mendations as to mining legislation, and
its representatives have always been a
definite and effective force before legisln
tive committees and with legislators. The
liberal support of the State Mining Bu
reau has been largely due to its influence.
The appropriation of $250,000, which it
gained from the Legislature as well as
horn Congress, is one evidence of its polit
ical force. Another among such evidences
is the tacit understanding with the Gov
ernor, that after raising hy $10,000 the ap
firopriation tor a California exhibit at the
'aris Exposition, $25,000 should be devoted
to the mining Industry of the State. It
lias been along such broad lines that the
association has worked so far. and it is
along such lines of general importance
tint it has gained the prestige and es
teem it holds in the halls of both national
and State legislation. The future effec
tiveness of the association In Washington
and Sacramento would be further in
creased by the co-operation of the leading
influences concerned in the mining indus
try of the southern part of the State. If
In the future two California miners' as
sociations should exist, the two would
hardly agree on the same specific propo
sitions, and the divided counsels might
easily confuse and defeat measures of im
portance to the whole mining industry of
the State. A larger representation of the
industry acting as a unit would add much
to the power and scope of the associa
tion'S efforts. What has been accomplish
ed so far. including an effective example
of what may be done by an organization
of the mining industry on broad lines has
b.^en done with little aid from Southern
California. The California Miners' Asso
ciation is not a chamber of mines, it con
cerns itself, with no mining properties
and it does not try 'n influence the min
ing trade. Its purposes are broader am. .c
confines itself to those broader purposes
of general legislation and the gÂ«n. ml
prosperity of the indus'ry. "Uncle Jak> '
Neff. who is and has been since its organ
ization its president, confines its efforts
to fields in which Southern California is
as much interested as any part of the
State.
Much San Francisco money Is Invested
in Southern California mining- properties,
but It is to the East and to Europe that
the whole State largely turns for mining
capital, and this is especially true of
Southern California. The California
Miners' Association has not given South
ern California especial attention for the
good reason that Southern California was
not represented in it. Its wants would
have more effective attention through one
strong State organization than through a
small independent one. The American In
stitute of Mining Engineers will meet
here in September as the guests of the
California Miners' Association, and that
will give another illustration of the value
of affiliation. The association will issue
a large and handsome exposition of the
mineral resources of the State, in which
Southern California will he fairly repre
sented and with which such an affiliated
association might concern itself. In the
matter of the Paris mineral exhibit a
unity of policy will add to the success of
the display. As a new mining region
Southern California will have land, water
road, legal and departmental matters
which would be handled with more suc
cess and benefit by a strong and influen
tial organization representing the whole
State than by one representing a small
region.
Active affiliation with the State associa
tion would tend to cure neglect if such
exists and to turn attention southward
and make the splendid undeveloped re
sources of Southern California better
known. The California Miners' Associa
tion seeks moral strength rather than
financial co-operation, and from every
point of view the interests of the mining
industry in Southern California seem
open to better service from a great than
from a local organization.
Since a review of the rapid rise of gold
dredging In California was published in
these columns a few weeks ago, three
new big modern dredgers of the chain
bucket type have begun actual operations
and five more are being arranged for by
three companies. On the Feather River
the Morigold Dredging Company has
started a new dredger on about 300 acres
of alluvial flat five miles below Oroville
This dredger has trouble with tree roots
which reduce its output from 2500 to 1200
cubic yards of gravel per twenty-four
hours. When such a dredger goes to
turning over such a recent river bench It
finds roote more troublesome than bowl
ders. This dredger Is rigged with a special
derrick to pull ami handle stump?.
On the American River not far from
Folsom, a Colorado Springs company has
started r dredger to work on an ancient
bench 150 feet above the river It was
sel up in an excavation to which water
is fl umed to float and operate the dredger,
an i the clayey nature of the ground there
greatly lessens the waste of water. This
company is planning to put another I
machine to work. A Postlewaite dredger
has just been sent from here to the Lewis
River in the Northwest Territory, it
will be. erected on Kike Bennett and
floated 200 miles to near the mouth of
the Hootnlinqua.
The Kia Ora Cold Dredging Company,
conducted by R. 11. Postlewaite, has suc
cessfully Btarted a very interesting dredg
ing operation by the Feather River. It
is "the first successful attempt in this
country to operate a floated dredger in
very porous ground. This new company
has 157 acres of land about a half mil"
from the river, which is an old river bed.
Most of the land is an orchard costing Sl5O
an acre, and the fruit trees are being
sacrificed for the gold below them. The
surface is about eleven feet above the
water line, and it is thirty feet to bed
rock. The pay ground varies greatly, but
it averages well and it is proposed to
work over every cubit? yard ot the ground
and turn the gay orchard into a waste of
tailings banked up behind the dredger.
The dredger was erected in a hole and
floated. Water for floating and working
is pumped and piped from the river by
a steam centrifugal pump. People called
Postlewaite n fool for proposing to pump
and maintain a lake In that sort of
ground, but 250,000 gallons a day is doing
the work. That represents the daily seep
age. The pumping costs $550 a day, in
cluding $2 2") for one man's wages and a
half-cord of wood a day. There is now
being built an electric pump designed to
be self-oiling and self-resruiating. which
need be visited but two or three times a
week thus saving a man's wages, etc.
During May this dredger handled 29.000
cubic yards of gravel in twenty-seven :
days at an expense of $1020. exclusive of
Interest and depreciation. The cost was
about 3 cents a yard and the returns were !
roundly $3000 or about 10 cents a yard.
There are many thousands of acres of ;
ground awaiting such operations in Cali
fornia.
There Is a lively demand for copper '
properties in the Campo Seco region. It I
Is a hopeful sign that the holders are not ;
disposed to sell.â Calaveras Citizen.
We are informed that preparations are
now being made to resume operations at
the Esperanza mine on a larger scale
than ever before. The stamp capacity is
to be increased to eighty stamps, a new
hoist to lie erected and the shaft, is to be
sunk an additional 500 feet. As soon as i
the new machinery can be put in place
there will be nearly 1M men at work at
the mine.â ("alaveras Chronicle.
At IS9S feet the new vertical shaft nt
the Oneida struck the ledge, and it was
found to he ten feet thick at this point.
Sinking will probably be continued to the
2100 level. The next thing in order will
be the cleaning out and retimberlng of
the old shaft, after which, if the outlook
continues favorable, we may expect to I
fef a mill erected.â Amador Republican.

NEWS OF FOREIGN NAVIES.
Three Russian tnrnedo boats building in
France are of :?12 tons displacement, to
steam 26 knots and will cost, collectively,
$906,000.
There is great activity at the dockyard
at Kiel, when- the armored cruiser Furst
Bismarck and a sister ship of 10,630 tons
are being built with great rapidity. The
total working force is 6840 men, a large
number of them working on night shifts.
It is reported that when the British
battleship Victorious was recently dock
ed at Yokosuka the Japanese naval con
structors discovered t..at the draught
marks were wrong and that the
ship actually dr. v.- one foot less than
the marks indicated.
The small cruiser presented by Spanish
residents in Mexico to the mother country
has been begun at Cadiz. The vessel will
b< 288 feet In length, 3G feet beam and 2000
tons displacement. The battery will con
sist of four 5.51 inch, four 4 inch, four 6
pounders, all quick-firers, and two ma
chine guns.
The gun factory at Osaka is now
equipped to manufacture ordnance ( .f
11-inch caliber. The limit was hitherto
9.4.". Inches fur puns and 11 inches for
mortars. Additional machinery has been
imported from France since lKt*4. and the
first gun of 11 Inches caliber, weighing
Z, tons, has been begun.
The Vulcan Shipbuilding Company at
Stettin is about to build a drydoek of
large capacity at Cuxhaven, at the mouth
of the Elbe. This company, having the
Emperor of Germany as a largo shnre
holder, is kept busy on naval contracts,
and the new dock will bo a semi-Govern
ment improvement in line with the grow
ing navy of the German Empire.
French dockyards have in hand quite a
large number of vessels in course of con
struction. Brest has five battleships, one
armored cruiser and two submarine boats;
Rochefort has seven vessels, Toulon four",
L'Orient seven and Cherbourg ten vessels
making a total of thirty-six vessels of all
kinds. In the same number of navy-yards
in the United States not a single vessel is
being built.
The British Admiralty has purchased
300,000 feet of fireprof wood for the
Queen's yacht and 350,000 feet for the use
of ships now in course of construction.
The contractors, whose works are located
at Fulham, do not claim tnat the wood Is
fireproof, for it will char, but it Riiann
tees that the wood will not convey Barnes
and thus start conflagration on board
ship. This latter quality is all the Ad
miralty expects the wood to possess, and
the tests have been successful.
The Norwegian Government is follow
ing the example of other naval powers in
extending subvention to merchani steam
ers with a view of utilizing them aÂ« na
val vessels in time of war. As a beginning
the Bergen Steamship Company has
encouraged to build a Bmall steamer at
Christiania at a cost of ?1 2.'.. ''""â ". to
14 to 15 knots, and the Government guar
antee* a yearly subvention of $2775. which
is equal to 2.3 per cent on the capital in
vested.

The Argentine Republic is building a
drydock at Porto Belgrano, in Ruenos
Ayres, which will be fiiW feet in length and
carry thirty feet over the sill. -
fortsâ one of which hns already been com
pletedâare also in course of construction
and will mount heavy Krnpp Riinp. The?*
improvements, together with a short rail
road, will cost about J12.000.000, and the
work is being done by Dutch contractors.
Hitherto the only drydock in the Argen
tine was at San Fernando, and being only
300 feet long was unsulted for the lorg
ships of the Argentine navy or merchant
steamers in need of docking.
T,ord Charles Beresfnrd and Mr. Ritchfo
president of the Board of Trade, are noi
agreed on the question of 8
British seamen and how to remedy this
serious difficulty. Mr. Ritchie, who is als<
a member of Parliament, recently gay.
his views in writing to an Inquiry by (
deputation of the Navy League, statins
that the scheme of training lads at th<
expense of the Government was one hi
positively declined to put before tlv
House of Commons, and contended that 11
the mercantile marine wanted British sea
men they should train them at their owr
expense.' Lord Beresford, replying I
letter, said he was not at all surprised a'
Mr. Ritchie's answer. The attitude of au
thority always had been to ignore greai
questions till the press and public Insist
on something being done. The dearth
British seamen and the fa^t that the
ranks will have to be depleted in \v.
time by taking away their finest spec:
mens for the Royal Naval Reserves con
stitute. in Lord Beresfnril's opinion, a se
rious danger, and contended that it was
the duty of the Government to take up
this question and endeavor to find a solu

way of inducing them to do this was tr

Communications From the Unseen

10 Personate the

St. Luke's wÂ»s crowded yesterday
morning to hear the Right Rev. Bishop
Mqreland on tho subject of spiritualism. I
Tho Bishop delivered an eloquent address
and hold his audience to the closest at- |
tention. His text was taken from the !
first Corinthians. ix:2lâ "Ye cannot drink i
of the cup of tho Lord and the cup of
the devil. Ye cannot be partakers of the
I Lord's table and the table of the devil."
, The following is a synopsis of the s< r-
X 1s usual to begin a sfrmon on spiritualism j
by pronouncing it a fraud and humbug without I
v ract underlying its manifestations, i am not I
prepared to take this position. Intelligent >
people are convinced t:;at beneath much ire- j
tense an.l deception th-r.' is some foundation '
<>f fa<t. TU* strongest evidence M my mind I
is that the won! of <;â â !. from Genesis to Rev- !
elation, recognizes the existence tit mediums ,
uiul sutxeitfrs, iii.il from llje beginning: of the |
world Cs:.i) condemns t!:e::i and forbids our :
so^kins information fr.-in them. We believe I
thr.t if any communications come inuii the '
up, ritual, unseen world to mediums an>l clair- i
voyants, thÂ«-y c '" n ; - come from deceased per;
Bens, but from lying spirits who personate the j
deceas'-'l. J.'sus Christ revealed nil that it is |
vii?<Â« for :;s to know about the other lif-\ and !
â¢when we ;tv into its secrets we b-soome the |
I victims <if mocking evil spirits, whose aim is j
to draw th.- soul away from Christ;
Pr-Sritualipm deadens the f-Hs>nin:2 p^wr?
ar.i reduces the Intellect to a level nf fru'.li
bility beyond belief. It a.3tla a new horror to '
dying to think that we may In the spirit j
lift* I â¢â  the souse we hr.ii here and return to j
our friends the we.ik. sentimental driblue that j
the mediums furnish. Our departed fr!on>ls |
have lost their love for us if they will not
ci mmunicate save tlirouch a Ftrancer. and
th^n only when the medium's nalm â like th* I
gipsy fortune tellerâ is crossed with silver.
The c. ntinued life nf cur friends does not de
!-t1 on the !lin;sy prop of spiritualism, but on |
the resurrection of Christ- The souls of the I
blessed arÂ«^ in tho l;an.ls of God and there â  an
no torment and no medium touch thÂ»m. The I
tru^ comfort is to have fellowship with our I
loved ones In paradise through Jesus <;hrist.

GOD IN OUR EARLY
NATIONAL HISTORY
The Centra] . Methodist Episcopal
Church held services again last evening
in the Metropolitan Temple. The audi
torium was ailed in every part. Dr.
Charles Edward Locke delivered a patri
otic sermon, appropriate to Bunker Hill
Day, his subject being L'Gbd In Our Early
National History," and the text, "I will
make of thee a great nation." Genesis
xii:2.
Dr. Locke said in part:
God In history is a subject of more romantic
Interest than the most fascinating fiction. The
westward march of civilization from the up
lands of Hindustan to the eastern shores of i
the great Pacific reveals the guiding and con- .
trolling Influence of th* God of nations. As
*braham was called from the shadows of
Oriental paganism to go forth and establish a
new nation so we are bold to claim that God ]
I spoke to our forefather* bidding them cross
'the boisterous sea and plant in virgin soil the
seeds of a new era, promising them as M" did
the "father of the faithful,." "I will make or .
thee a great nation."
The geographical location of our republic In- !
dicates providential and not accidental direc
tion In the temperate zone our fathers laid
the foundation of thin republic. Mighty men
la-e mighty trees grow in the temperate zone.
With 3 l-W OfiO -'|-'are miles of territory. 26.000
miles of river way and 12.000 miles of ooast, and j
with Inexhaustible resources of fabulous I
wealth an arena Is presented for the splendid 1
struggle of an advancing civilization against I
all medieval force?.
The Declaration of Independence and the
Constitution of the United States both bear the!
certain marks of the God of nations who sup- j
plements the Ignorance and Balteness of men
and helps them to build better than they know.
The years have wen many victorious dc
f ',â hut none more magnificent than the
..tile of Bunker Hill. What a conflict was
that my countrymen! The heavenly host wit- !
'",;;,) thai valiant struggle behind the para-
Ects of the clouds. When Warren, gallant, i
amiable, divine, fell, every drop of blood be
came an armed chevalier of liberty, a crimson
symbol at victory. Noble and true patriot*

the Ood of nations, recognizing the heritages

MYSTERIOUS
DISAPPEARANCE
OF DIAMONDS
They Were Valued as
Presents.
BELONGED TO MRS. LUBELSKI
THE EMPTY BAG FOUND ON THE
STREET NEAR THE HOUSE.
â 4 â
Police Think It Was Either the Work
of a Sneak Thief or the Sack
Fell From Lubelski's
Coat.
The mysterious disappearance of a bag
of diamonds belonging to Mrs. T. Lu
belski, wife of A. Lubelski, 307 Golden
Oate avenue, was reported to the polico
yesterday afternoon and Detective George
Graham has been detailed on the case.
Lubelski Is a returned Klondiker and, it
Is said, made a fortune in his search for
gold. He is now a money broker at 14
Fifth street He and his wife intended
going to Oakland yesterday afternoon.
They were sitting in the parlor and Lu
belski's Prince Albert coat had been
thrown over the back of a chair while he
enjoyed a cigar. His wife had been in the
habit of allowing her diamonds to lie on
top of the bureau drawers in her bedroom
and recently he got her to make a cloth
bag, fill it with wadding and pui her dia
monds in it. She attached a string to it
and wore it around her nei k.
"Get yourself ready," said Lubelski to
his wife., "and I will go to the Orpheum
and g< t tickets for to-night." Mrs. Lu
belski took the bag of diamonds from her
neck and threw it on the chair where her
husband's coal was and went to the bath

WON WHEN THEY
OUGHT TO HAVE
BEEN SHOT OUT
Locals Presented With
a Game.
OAKLANDS WENT TO PIECES
MOSKIMAN AND FITZPATRICK
HAD A PITCHERS' DUEL.
â¦
The Dudes Batted Out the Morn
ing 1 Gnme at Golden
Gate in the First
s Inning.
After losing 1 a slugging contest. with the
Oaklands at Golden Gate yesterday
morning the FVlscob won out a game In
the afternoon In which they should never
have tallied. ore, 5 to 2.
The Dudes piled up a total of six errors,
although the official averages will wipe
one of Sctimeer's bungles out and Increase
Sullivan's batting by one hit. The con
test at Recreation Park, despite Oakland's
misdeeds^ was replete with sensational
llelding and kirks, while the box work of
Fitzpatrlck and Mosklman was about a
standoff, the fireman being found for one
hit more than his opponent, but he also
struck out one more man. Neither pitcher
jrave a base on balls nor hit a batsman.
Hank Harris failed to make good his
ngreement with .). Cal. Ewlng to don
a uniform and coach his team. When the
critical : period arrived and Hank was
given a uniform, he passed it up. Some
Miy that his feet reached the temperature
of icÂ«> cream; others that the baseball
shoes provided' for him were not built on
The right lines, for comfort; but whatever
It was. Hank will entertain a party at
dinner next Wednesday night, for Swing
came out on the diamond looking like the
treasurer of a hand organ combination.
Fully SOW people witnessed the frame, of
whom a considerable portion ought to
have been ejected from the grounds for
their insults to Captains I-ange and i ('Neil
and Umpire Cahill. Captains have a per
fect right to question any decision they
may consider wrong} and argue the point,
and the umpire, while he may make mis
taken, gives his decisions as he sees them.
All are entitle! to fair treatment, and the
management should accord it to them.
The locals opened up the entertainment
with a brace of tallies, both Kifts from
their opponents' Pyne led off with a
grounder to imi er and was sad on the
wondt-r's error. King followed with an
Infield bunt, but nobody could get it In
time. Then Kile> sent one to Peeples,
forcing Krug at second base, Sehmeer
completing a double play by nipping Josh
at first, Pyne going to third. Sullivan hit
i.. Lange, who made a skyrocket throw
to first letting I'yne home and Sully
around to third, rom where he scored on
i lilderbrandt's single.
Frisco's last bunch of tallies was
picked in the seventh. Johnson being re- |
sponsible for them all. It was this way:
After Sullivan had been fielded out at
first by Lange, Hilderbrandt laced out a 'â 
double to left. Mulle.r'B out at first placed
him on third. Then O'Neil, who had a !
barrel of fun with some corking good I
things coining over on the boat rattled
Johnson and won the game Foxy Tip
hit to Peeples and as fielded out at first
by ten feet: but Tip, while still running:,
tailed to â¢'thill to watch Johnson. The
latter lost his head, and having stepped
off the bag, made a jab to put O'Neil out, i
missed him. and Cahill. taking the mo- j
tion as an admission that the runner was I
not out in the first place, called him safe. I
Swindells and F'ltzpatriek followed with !
a brace of doubles, scoring l [ilderbrandt ;
and O'Neil. Swindells coming home on
Fitz's smash, and all after the side had
been retired.
Four hits were all the Oaklands could
pet off Fitz up to the ninth Inning, but i
they landed on him then good and plenty, j
and had not the other members of the j
team come to his rescue, and by every
trick and device, Including a fake Injury
by Hilderbrandt, delayed the game until :
the fireman could get back his nerve, they â¢
might have won out. Schmeer opened i
with â¢â â  double and scored on a duplicate
shot by Shea, who broke Into the game In ;
the titli Inning when Hammond hurt his j
band and had to reire. Dunleavy's single :
put Shea over the plate, at which Khz be- i
came visibly rattled. But before he could !
sustain further damage his associates ral- i
lifd to his rescue, and aftÂ« all bands had i
indulged In a talking match for five mln- j
mep Hilderbrandt suddenly discovered j
that he â  id hurt his leg. or was coming j
down with measles, or something, and ten |
minutes more were consumed in watching j
his antics. This gave the man with the |
hose a chance to rest, and the game was i
soon ended.
Oakland won the morning game in the
first inning, when seven hits, Including a
pair of doubles, an error and a wild pitch,
netted six runs. After that Iberg stead
ied down and allowed only four hits.
Frisco also did some slugging in the
fifth, when five hits, including a homer
and a triple, secured five tallies. With
the bases full. Shea gave way to Mos
kiman. who # nnished the game, a hit off
him giving one more run in that inning.
Oakland's last run came in that inning,
when Dunleavy put the ball over the
fence for the circuit. Frisco's run In the
third was due to a base on balls, a passed
ball and two singles. Following are both
scores:

DEAN'S DOGS
DIVIDED THE

FAST HARES AND GOOD SPORT
Â«.
PACIFIC DERBY FOR PUPPIES
WENT TO LADY CLAIRE.
Lady Emma Captured the Reserve

J. Dean'? great black dogs, Connemara
and Gladiator, divided ;he ladies' i iy
champion stake at Union Coursing Park
yesterday, defeating the pick of the local
greyhounds. Tiider the rules of coursing
it was not necessary for the dogs to run
the final course. Their owner elected to
send them to the slips, although first and
second money had already been won by
them.
Mr. Dean wished to win the final with
Connemara, his favorite hound. 'Die la
dies of his family, however, and many of
the spectators wanted Gladiator to win
and shouted encouragement to him (hiring
the winning of the course. Gladiator led
from the slips, but Connemara gradually

drew up to him until they ran like a 'â 
double team. Gladiator secured the first
' turn, to the evident delight of his sup
porters. Connemara was then placed and
worked the hare for a number of turns.
The hare was both fast and strong and |
I led the dogs clean across the field, suc
i cumbing linally after a desperate struggle
for life. The red flag went up, signaling
another victory for Connemara.
The hares were carefully selected for
; tin- champion stake and furnished great
sport. They swerved on several occasions,
thereby favoring some of the dogs. War
ship, the fast San Jose dog, which won |
. the stake last Sunday, met Connemara in
the first round. He led to the hare, show- !
ing great speed. The hare swerved to |
| Connemara; and the latter ran up a win- :
: ning score, his greater experience telling
against i he young dog.
The final of the reserve stake resulted
in a rattling race between Patria and
i Lady Emma. The latter led to the hare, .
which then favored Patria. She scored
many points and the Bhort-enders, who
had played her. commenced to cheer.
Their joy was short-lived, as Emma ]
scored sufficient points to win, and then I
killed.
A number of short-enders won during

A LARGE COMBINED FLEET
CRUISES ON THE BAY.
* . _
Forty Boats of All Sizes Follow
Commodore Allen M. Clay in
His Trim Flagship
Pactolus.
Rarely has Oakland Creek pr^ponU-d a
brighter or mor^' Inspiring spectacle than
it did yesterday morning, when, upon the
signal from Commdore Allen M. Clay of
the Calforaia V.-icht Club, between thirty
nn<l forty white-winged craft heaved
anchor <;ist off stem lines and began to
beat to windward cut of the creek. Col
ors had bt>en given from tho flagship Pac
t.iiiis ;it s a. m.. and ;>t LO o'clock the
preparatory sii~:;al followed. At 10:15 the
signal. "Get under way." sot thf> whole
fleet in motion. Commodore Allen M.
Clay's flagship Pactolus was followed by
Commodore T. C. Mill's flagship Cygnus,
Commodore Carl Westerfeld's flagship
Aeolus and Vire Commodore W. H.
Toepke'a sloop Harpoon. i
Commodore Tliil of the San Franciscos
flew the dub burgee, but The Corinthian
commodore and vice commodore sailed
under Hag officers' pennants. Though so
large ;i number of yachts was tad^ing
back and forth in the creek, a pleasant
disposition not to insist too strongly <<n
the right of way was shown, and not the
slightest foul occurred. On reaching- the
mouth of the estuary thÂ«> signal "Mission
Bay" was set, and the whole (loot began
in beal over to the city front. The inten
tion had been to beat out as far as the
Presidio shoal buoy, thence proceed to
Sausalito, Tiburon and Raccoon Straits,
but the breeze In the channel was so
fresh and the sea kicked up by the wind
meeting an ebb tide was so rough thatthe
San Francisco yachts shaped their course
dired for Sausalito, which was reachedby
the flagship Cygnus at 2 p. m. The rest
of the fleet dropped in at various times
during the afternoon. The Corinthians
made for Tiburon, while tho California
boats sailed through the straits, behind
Angel Island, and so home to their mniir-
Ings. The combined cruise was sue, ess
fnl and the < xcellent attendance of yachts
from sister dubs was most gratifying to
Commodore ' 'lay.
The San Francisco boats that left Sau
salito oft Saturday afternoon or evening
and moored near the California Club |
house were the folowing:
Commodore T. U Hill's flagship Cyg
nus, Secretary K. < '. Bartlett's yawl
Frolic, .1. H. Savory's sloop Juanita, H.
Dot's yawl Phyllis, R. S. Bridgeman's
sloop Thetis, A. Sunderland's sloop Cath
erine. 11. B. Holbrook's sloop We're Here
and .1. Kittterman's launch America. The
following Corinthian yachts accompanied
Commodore C. Westerfeld's flagship
Aeolus: The sloops Harpoon. Truant. Mil
lion. Emilie, Rover, Hal. yon. Queen,
Freda, Edna, Cupid. Emma. Ella and'
Clara, and the yav. Is Nereid and ArCtU
rus. Commodore Clay was on hand to give
a tow with the launch Doris to any yacht
that desired it. but few needed the serv
ice.
About 7 o'clock in the evening a
chowder and bean supper was served in
the Caifornia Club house, and was much
reiislvd I).-, the yachtsmen. Later Com
modore Clay made some remarks of wel
come and an Impromptu entertainment
followed.
The band of the Fifth Regiment, N. G.
c.. supplied music, and Cornetist Shay
rendered some excellent solos. Frank
Thompson and others told stories and the
Edna quintet gave several songs, it was
midnight before the yachtsmen began to
disperse, and considerably later still be
fore all had sought repose.

There cannot ho f,mr Chiefs of the Po
lice Department, as there have been in j
the. 'past live year?. Whenever a itrnl- !
man knows that he, can obtain a private j
audience with one or other of the three j
Police Commissioners, the Kief will have I
but little authority. It is no secret that >
nearly every man on the force flatters |
himself that he has had some kind of a |
pull with one of the Commissioners. To |
such an extent has this been curried in |
the past that many men have been able j
to pick their own beats. Where this prac- j
tiee prevails there can be no discipline i
and this is the secret of the demorali- j
zatlon ... department that it is I
claimed exists at this time. Going further, j
it is notorious that even some of the mem- j
hers of the commission have been practi- |
rally forced by outside politicians to do j
things against their better judgment, If j
this system is to continue there may as <
well be $175 a month saved by leaving the i
position of Chief â  ant. Having ap
polnted th.-ir man, it is the Commission- j
ets' duty now to take a back seat nd
look on. refraining from indicating any
preference for any individual member of i
the department and to leave the work i
of earning his salary to the Chief. The |
Commissioners should not only do this, |
but should distinctly impress the fact
upon every member of the department.
The situation at the City Hall is very
much like that at The Hagueâ everybody j
talking 1 peace, yet making war. At the;
same time there is no prospect of an al
liance. .The three men who in reality con
stitute the city government by reason of
their individual capacities and their col
lectiye power as a Board of Works are
not now in a position to be inordinately ;
aggressive. â â¢-.â¢â .. that they are as J
they are; for every question that comes â¢
up stands the best chance of being settled
on Its merits and not acording to the j
whim of any combination. The Mayor i
Ji.i.Â« his man at the head of the Police j
Department. The City Attorney has his
Â« hoice in the Street Department. The
City Engineer's man is in control of the-
Fire Department. Any attempt on the
part of any two of th-i three Commission
ers to displace the choice of the third i
man would immediately result in a !
change all around. As this is not desired j
apparent peace is politic.
The meeting of the Board of "Works is â 
it l^ng way from a love feast. The mem- [
! ers being gentlemen do not furnish any !
sensational matter, but the difference is \
n kind, not in degree. It resembles a j

There Is surely need of a tribunal of
arbitration at the Church of the Advent.
I for affairs there have reached a crisis
I that appeals to those Interested in re
ligion outside of thai parish. The rector,
Dr. Law, has been told to resign. He
says he lias refused. Church Treasurer
Reed says the rector is demagogic and
too fond of notoriety. The rector says the
treasurer Is a traitor. One vestryman op
posed to the rector is an allopathic doctor.
The rector, who has a certificate to prac
! tice from a homeopathic college, says this
fact accounts for the allopath's opposi
: tion. J. J. Valentine, the wealthy presi
dent of Wells, Fargo & Co.. is senior
warden, and the rector says he is penu
rious. Gossips are saying all manner of
things, and the rector is denying them.
Mr. Valentine preached a sermon against
expansion from the pulpit, which dis
pleased the rector's political ideas, and
since that time Mr. Valentine has kept
away, and the rector's plans have ex
panded in so many directions that many
of them have passed from his control.
Now comes the proposition to starve the
rector out. In the meantime, it is said, he
will take a much-needed long vacation â
which is doubtless true.
There are enough mooted projects be
fore the public at this time to engage its
serious attention for several minutes.
Among ..the schemes contemplated are: A
new City Hall; a beautified Lake Mer
ritt; public parks; sale of the City Hall
lot; consolidation of the city and county
under one government; division of AJame
da County, tunnel road Into Contra Costa ;
County; cutting Washington street
through to San Pablo avenue; bringing I
the Santa Fe road Into Oakland; acquir
ing a municipal water supply; construc
tion of boulevard, etc.

I alone can bring thesic things about.

It appears that the two boys had an al

scalp wound and one of his ears was bad
ly cut by the sharp and ragged edge of
the rock. His injuries were attended to
by a neighboring physician, who fears
that the boy's skull is fractured.
LIES AND LIARS.
Rev. Dr. Law Preaches a Stinging
Sermon.
OAKLAND. June IS.â Contrary to ex
pectations. Rev. V. Marshall Law to-day
occupied the pulpit at the Church of the
Advent. His sermon, in view of his resig
nation and of the many unkind thing's
that have been said of him of late, fur
nished much food fur thought. Rev. Mr.
T.:iw read a published Bermon from a hook
and tli.' text was, "I will take heed to my
ways that I sin not with my tongue:"
"Lel ub consider." said Rev. rvi r. Law,
"the sins of the tongue lies, which are a
sir. against the truth; slander, which is a
sin against our neighbor; unseemly
speech, which is a sin against modesty;
swearing, which is profanity; excessive
speech, which is wastefulness; a clamor
ing tongue, which is Intemperate.
"Tlie devil is referred to as a liar and
the founder of lies. We are told that they
who love lies shall he excluded from
heaven. Lies that are premeditated, de
liberately planned, are much worse than
the other s..rt.' r
In conclusion the minister gave a dis
sertation on the wastefulness of excessive
spc.-ch. The sermon was free from all
personalities, yet by some was considered
stingingly appropriate to the occasion.

Yesterday Father Knmm preached the
sermon a.t Last Mass at St. Mary's !
Cathedral. He built his discourse on the !
words of St. Peter to our Lord, "Depart I
from me for T am a sinful man," which
were taken from t >â¢ â¦* Gospel of the day.
Father Ramm told of the universal con-!
scionsness of pin on the part of man ,
when realizing the presence of God.
During the day the annual reorganiza
tion and classification of the Sunday i
school was held In the cathedral under
the direction of Rev. Father Prendergast.
At the i! o'clock mass yesterday morn-
Ing al St. Ignatius Church Rev. Father
Chiappa of Lob Gatoa preached a Bermon
â in "The Church." His tex< was from
the gospel 'if the day and embodied in the
following words: "Jesus going In-to one of
the ships thai was Simon'B desired him
to draw back a little from the land, and
sitting-, he preached to the multitudes out
<if tire ship." In p.iit Father Chiappa's
words were as follows:
The ship, according to the saints, Is a type of
the church. The bart >f Peter Is the symbol of
unity in iu> Rock, and expresses that upon
which our Lord laid the foundation for his
church. ChriÃt Instructed the multitudes
from SI Peter's bark, and to-day he only
preaches from that church which is represented
by Bt, Petei 'Â« bark
\s there is but one bark of St. Peter'B, so
there can be bui one true church. Moreover,
Christ (peaks of his church. not churches: his
klnÂ«d- m. not kingd in>; hla spouse. no< spouses;
tor he is neither polygamisi nor Mormon, and
can have but onÂ«- Bpouee. He further refers to
his body, not Â»>< â <! i.-r*. as he has bul one myth
ical body; pillar of truth, not pillar* of truth,
because truth Is one and error is manifold
l,inhÂ»r hae given birth to thÂ« Lutheran
church, tnu not to the church of Christ; CaJvin
founded his religion, but it was noi of Christ;
John Wesley laid the foundation of the Meth â 
dist denomination, but not of th-> church of
Christ: England has given rise to the Episco
palian belief, Scotland to the- Presbyterian, and
bo of nil ill' other sect and denominational
leaders and their followers. They may claim
the Rible for their foundation Finnp. but not
Christ for Dieii- founder. They may claim the
â  y ru!<- of faith and mor
ality, but Christ disowns them as children of
his flock because they hav< n it 1 -. i i : Â» for thejr
f'.in; !.-r. Nor are they coequal with Chrlal and
his apostlfs In point i foi all such m.
. denominations havi rung ml v - â¢
ence since the time of mir Lord.
Rev. Father MacCorry delivered the ser
mon at n o'clock ma^s at St. Mary's
Church. California h:i<! Dupont streets
His subject was "The Greal Balvation."
Special music was rendered by the choir.
.\t the same church In the evening Rev.
Father 11. 11. Wyman preached a sermon
from the following text: "We have la
bored all the night, bur have taken noth
ing, but at thy command I will let down
the net." In p.irt he said:
The incident related In to-day's gospel shows
that with all possible human effort It is not
possible for us to attain success in the object
for which we were placed in this world. In
a word our success, both temporal and Fpirit
ual, depends on the blessing of (Jod. We can
see this most clearly if we reflect that nil
things were made by the word of God, and
without Him that nothing was made. The
same God who created us had established an
order to be followed and he blesses us a'
cordlnt'ly as #c follow it. The One who
created all things preserves them until his
will concerning them is accomplished.
The only obstacle to the accomplishment of
God'? will Is sin, in consequence of which the
original blessing of creation lias been less
<:;.â â¢] and the world has become a vale of tears,
so that we are in constant need of a merci
ful and bountiful God to take away this curse.
St. Peter, though doubtless he had labored
hard and persistently. Had received no fruit
for his pains, but the Lord as a reward of his
i Hit brought to him a more abundant bless
ing than he had even dreamed of.
The effects of the divine blessings are life,
sustenance, prosperity rind happiness. The
means for obtaining these benefits are faith
and charity. Those who are In the state of
grace have the first claim on God's blessing.
For such the law of God is the first thins of
importance, and God has from the beginning
promised his blessing to those who keep HiÂ«
commandments. Again special blessing, both
temporal and spiritual, are Imparted through
the channels of grace, deposited In the church.
DID NOT OWE HIS
ELECTION TO BOODLE
Ex-Senator Hill Denounces Lock-
wood's Attack Upon Judge
Haight.
ALBANY, June 18.â Ex-Senator and ex-
Governor David B. Hill, wh<> was ai thi
head of the defeated Democratic State
ticket the year that Judge Height was
elected with the rest of the Republican
State ticket, said to-night, concerning Ij.
M. Lockwood's testimony in relation to
Judge Halght's election, given before the
Industrial Commission:
Judge Haitf'nt wag elected in the fall of km.
At tlmt election 1 beaded the Democratic ticket
for Governor, leading â¢â ' forlorn hope and 1
! i;..,t the campaign very well, The Demo
, â¢â  â¢- h;i'l to cvii!.- . â¢ the hard times,
the silver panic, ih<- wiij'.n tariff and dis
ci'.sures "f niii:;i<-:i>:i! corruption, p.s well .is
divisions among Democrats themselves, and ot
, urse tiiH result was a Republican cyclone, as
everybody knew it would be, Thf Republicans
needed no Immense corruption fund, either from
the Standard Oil Company or anybody else,
to elect their whole ticket. Including Judge
Halght. I recollect at tht- time there waa some
criticism, principally by a coterie Â»f Populists,
of a decision which Judge Halght ha.i once
made as a Supreme Court Justice in Buffalo,
but it attracted no particular attention in thÂ»>
campaign an<l was regarded by myself and the
Democrats generally as unworthy of notice. At
any rate, it cut no !lÂ»;urp In the canvass. Judge
Hu'iÃht belnK elected by !!iV.<24 plurality over ;i
most able and popular opponent, Judge Haight
receiving 671,259 votes, while Governor Morton
received only a few moreâ to wit. 678.818.
it I? absurd for a Pennsylvania^, at this day.
who can naurally have no knowledge of the
matter of which he assumes to speak, to as
sert that Judge Haight waa either nominated
r,r elected in New Tork State through the con
trlbutloni of the Btandard Oil Company. Tt
verifies the old baying that "one must go away
from home to get the news." He was elected
because the ti<!>- of that year, in New York as
v i as everywhere ei<e, was with hie party
and he was nominated because of his high per
sonal character, his efficient. Judicial ability
and unquestioned Integrity, conceded by the
whole bar and i pie of the State, and as a
fair political opponent, it gives me pleasure to
say this much.
INGRATITUDE OF GAGE
ANGERS REPUBLICANS
Santa Clara Good Government League
Ignored by the
Executive
SAX JOSE, June IS.â Who will be ap
pointed Supervisor for the Fifth District
of S:uit.-i Clare County by Governor Gage
to (ill the vacancy caused by the death of
(Supervisor S. F. Ayer iy a question wor
rying the- politicians of this-- city and coun
ty. It is not because of a dearth of appli
cants, for there are fully a score of thorn,
but it is a question who oat the largest
â¢â¢pull" with the chief executive. T!u> lira
forces so far have captured all the patron
age that Gage has dispensed in this
county, and in all probability they will
win out in this fight.
The Republican Good Government
League has selected a half dozen men thru
would be favorable to the organization
and is endeavoring to land one of the lot.
In this list are ex-Sheriff James H. Lyn
don of Los Gatos, G. H. Walker of Los
Gatos, T. R. Johns of West Side, E. Top
ham of Milpitas. This organization in
curred the enmity of Gage by passing a
resolution condemning Dan Burns during
the Senatorial fight at Sacramento, and ;
si) far all its men chosen for places have
been turned down. This was particularly
noticeable in the selection of Normal
School trustees, a manager of the Agnewa
Insane Asylum board and the directors oi
the Agricultural Society, appointed only
yesterday.
it is said that because of the adoption of
those anti-Burns resolutions both Gage
and Hums have sworn to ignore the j
wishes of Santa Clara County's strongest
organization. Although making a deter
mined light against the Republican rim,-.
the Good Government League "swat- j
lowed" a number of objectionable men on
the legislative ticket. Jt made an espe- I
dally strong fight for the Senator and
Assemblymen from here, and In fad elect
ed them and secured a big majority for
Gage throughout the county. The league
has a membership of over 2*loo, ami had
it given the same strong support to tha
Democratic legislative ticket it did to the
fusion county ticket only Democrats
would have gone to Sacramento. To-day
the members of the organization are re
belling against the ingratitude of Gajrc
and the legislative ticket elected. A
wider breach than ever i> being rreal '1
in the Republican ranks of this county,
and unless s^me of the "plums" f.li to
the members of the league the nexl dele
gation to the Legislature will be solidly
Democratic.
In the Rea camp there are several can
didates for the Supervisorship. Fred Cot
tie has the insid>- track and probably will
be appointed. Senator Shortridge favors
him. and this Is considered equivalent to
a Hums indorsement.
City politics is becoming Interesting.
There will be two vacancies in the City
Board of Education and one eai h in th '
Park Commission. Police Commission and
the Library Trustees on July 1. These
appointments are to be made by Mayer
Martin. There are at least fifty candi
dates for the places, and all kinds of in
fluences are being brought to be^r. Th 9
first election under the new charter oc
curs next April, and th^se appointments
promise to rut some figure in the results
Especially po is this true in the Scho '1
Board There has been more or les.=
trouble In this board. The High School
strike of a year ago has created consid
erable sentiment against the Trustees. If
Trustees of the same political affiliations
are appointed it means a solid opposition
to ihe re-election of Mayor Martin, but
whether the Mayor is willing to meet 'hi.<
force at the polls remains to be seen.

was arrested to-night on h charge of dis

acquirement of much beer down town.
Pacp undertook to havf it out with the
umpiro. The latter was* prepared, hnw
ever, and Pace came out of the encounter
witti a slightly rtisfigurf-d eye.
Pace deemed it desirable to try an
other mftlKifl of showing his displeasure,
so he procured a hatchet He did not
have a eham-p to use i., and when the jm
licp gatherer] him in the handle was found
sticking "nt of the pocket, where he had

'â¢ made their rivals' eyes turn green with

"THE CITY AND THE CHURCH"
Sermon of the Rev. Mr. Stephens of
the Simpson Memorial Church.
The Rev. John Stephens of Simpson
Mi morial Church preached on the sub
ject of "The City and the Church." last
evening. A good-sized audience listened
to the earnest address of the pastor. Ho
spoke in part as follows:
| The evangelization of the city Is the greatest
problem that confronts the Christian church
to-day. The tendency in modern times Is to
ward large increase In urban populations ana
a corresponding slowness of development In
rur.il districts. Throughout the entire world
a tide of population seems to be flowing toward
the great centers. This has been produced
through industrial and social changes that
could not be resisted. This has given the city
even a larger place in the nation's affairs than
It has held In the past, and the Christlanlza
tion of the nation has become to a large extent
a question of the evangelization of the cities.
The church In this city has been keeping pace
in Its growth with the increase of the. popula
tion, but it has not been gaining upon the city's
development. The:Â» are. encouraging signs of
a healthful public sentiment In this community.
The successful protests of the public, as ex
pressed through our dally Journals, against the
gambling mania and flagrant vice presented
| on the stage ere good omens for the future.
HE BADE GOOD BY
TO THE MINISTRY
KEY. W. M. LOWELL PBEAOHES
TTIS FAREWELL SERMON.
The Divine Will Devote All His
Energies to Literature and
the Lecture Platform.
Rev. Walter Myron Lowell bade good-by
to the ministry last night at California
Methodist Episcopal Church and will now
devote himself entirely to literature and
t<> the lecture platform, in both of which
he has achieved some fame. Rev. W. w.
Case, presiding elder of the church,
granted him the necessary permission
with Tvor.'.s of commendation.
In hie farewell sermon, wWch b<
pr< ached from the text "Thou diJst well
that it was in thy heart," Ist Kings,
viil:lÂ£, Dr. Lowell said:
We fall to apprehend the situation when we
understand the work of doing good to be ours,
and that God is only helping us in it. Th'i
work is His, and we are permitted to co
operate with Him. He is the architect, we the
laborers. He the captain, we the soldiers,
and yet there is n dignity conferred upon us
which may well make us lift up our heads and
make us proud of our calling. It is a great
honor for God Almighty to call in to His
service any one of the children of man to
assist in the work He has designed.
It is p. touching thing that after the work Is
finished, God should say to the man helping
Him, "Thou didst well." The Divine com
mendation is sufficient reward for all toil and
sacrifice.
We often fail to see our hopes realized, and
we fall of (iur highest ambition, yet it is
enough to know that "Thou didst well, that
it was In thy heart" to do It. It is much to
have a real â <â  Ire to do a good work. There
will me a time when all the good we desire
will be accomplished. There will be no oppo
sition to . lod works in the other life.
Many of my dreams have not materialized:
much that I had hoped to accomplish has not
been realized, yet I feel it is well that it was
In my heart to do the good I have wished, even
If I have not seen my largest plans succeed.
After the services many of the congre
gation preseni pressed forward and shook
the retiring clergyman's hand and
wished him godspeed in his new Held of
labor.
the Mira Monte* were again to the
front. The captain of the team. Jim
Bride, had secured the services of
Hugh Johns of the ark Argonaut. Tho
captain of the Mount Views made a
strong kick against Johns playing, but
with excellent forethought he had
been supplied with a receipted bill
from the hotel for three months'
board.
The Mount Views were first to the
bat but failed to score in their first
Inningâ in fact, they wore not able to
hit l>r. Stevens' swift balls until the
later part of the game, when certain
defeat was staring them in the fare.
The Mount Views did not worry about
not scoring, because they thought
they would play a waiting race and
just Jolly their opponents. But when
T>r. Stevens, followed by Johns, went
to The bat and hit pitcher Landry's
curves in the direction of San Quentin
there was a murmur of fear. The sec
ond inning of the Mount Views was a
repetition of the first. In the fourth
Jim Bride became the idol of the ladles
f< r.vermore. He went to the bat
with a look of scorn on his face, and
with a look of compassion at Catcher
H. Ahpel Buggested that he and his
companions had better learn to play
golf, as at baseball it was all over but
the shouting. He emphasized his re
marks with a homo rug. The Mount

fourth inning, when they secured four

THE POLICY OF ENGLAND IS
STRONGLY CRITICIZED.
Warm Resolutions Unanimously-
Adopted hy the Organization.
Interesting Bits of a
Day's Outing.
Two lonpr trains of enrs were necessary j
to accommodate the crowds that attended
the seventh annual picnic and reunion of ;
I the Kniphts of the Rod Hrnnch Rifles in ;
; Pan Jnst- yesterday. Agricultural Park
was filled with a merry crowd of picnick
era, who spent the day in danclnpr, stroll- .
lnj? through the spacious grounds nnd
| watching the hounds chase the lively
"jacks."
Delegations from Oakland and sur
rounding: towns attended the reunion. The
Garden City was well represented and the
representatives of that place helped to
i make the occnsinn a memorable one. â¢
i "Sergeant" Roach and Officers Olarke and
; Harris of the Southern Station had an i
easy time of it. the hoodlum element,
which usually attends a Sunday picnic, i
being: conspicuous by Its absence.
During the afternoon the. festivities j
were halted for a few minutes, and M. V.
Jordan, a prominent member of the- Irish
organization, introduced the following
resolutions, which were unanimously (
! adopted and ordered sent to the parties
mentioned:
Whereasâ England's sophistry and hypocrisy ;
has manifested itself in the most hideous man- ;
j ncr for the past year. We repudiate ami de
'â â  nounce her fictitious and malignant news sent
I to the I'nlted States during the flaid time, j
She is now preparing: to make war upon a
free and liberty-loving people, their only
crime being the preservation of tlielr lndepen- â¢
dence, which she has denied to some of her
subjects for centuries; therefore, be It
Resolved -That we extend to the I'resident
of the Transvaal republic and to his loyal sub- ;
Jpi-ts cmr deepest sympathy. And we call up
on our countrymen in the South African repub- ;
lie to be true t i thp traditions of their race |
and to resist till death the criminal aggressions
of adventurous English squatters ;(M<l their j
supporters. And be It further
Resolvedâ That we Irish-Americans of the!
State of California, believing in the principle j
of the American constitution that all men are \
created equal, request our representatives In !
the national Legislature to protest ;<t;;iinst her
Iniquitous Bystem of land piracy.
Resolved â First â That we Irish-American :
â¢ .-â¢â â¢â â â¢ of the State of California do hereby :
:..| admire the actions of th<- H n
Daly, Mayor of I.imerlck.
:. I That we re â  sn!zc Mr. McHugrh,
Mayor of si!t n . recently elected Councilman
and Magistrate, a Merlin*, patriotic Irish
Nationalist, and we congratulate him on his
ful effort in prohibiting a Tory Magis
trate from occupying the chair.
Third- -That w" send Â«rÂ»'et mÂ«s to the people '
of Irelan-1 fur the grand victory they achieved
| last April.
Fourth -That we condemn the difference nf
( pinion existing l*twÂ«-n the Irish members of j
Parliament.
The gamof proved a feature, of the day !
runs, and their lady admirers for a
momfnt breathed tlio> sweet scent of
victory, l.ut from that on they hold
their parasols toward the field, so that
their tears of mortification might not
be Been by the "horrid girls" on the
other side of the field.
At the end of the fifth ining the
game was drawn to a close and Joe
O'Brien- who had alternated with Al
Hampton In the capacity of umpire,
tore off his scarlet sash and murmured
something about passing the Mount
Mews up like, a white check The
mascot of the Mount Views, a big
rooster, also hung his head and seemed
very ashamed of his company. Jack
Martin took compassion on the poor
bird and tragically declared that he
would adopt the disgraced hoodoo.
At the close of the game the different
factions for a time extended the olive
branch of peace, and with the utmost
of good form the Mira Monte contin
gent, besides offering their condo
lences, heard with an air of patronage
their now defeated rivals' excuses for
their poor game of ball.
The Mira Monte team was composed
of Dr. Stevens H. Johns. W. Artin

CHAPLAIN ALLENSWORTH
APPEALS TO HIS RACE
Chaplain Allenswnrth of the Twenty
fourth Infantry delivered an interesting
discourse to a larpe confrregration at the
Starr King A. M. K. /.ion Church last
evening. He spoke to the text: "Fi^ht
the pood fight of faith." During his
sermon he called attention to the fact
that the negro had fought in all of the
great wars of the nation and has won for
himself, and to the nation of which he is
a part, an imperishable record. The
speaker dwelt at length on the splendid
work done by the colored troops at San
Juan and other notable tights in the late
war with Spain. Ho said they were again
called to s" to Manila and bear a share
in the conflict, and he said they were
ready. That whenever a call upon them
was made they responded "Here I am.
send me."
The chaplain appealed to his young list
eners to educate themselves, intellectu
ally, morally and religiously; to become
men nf good, sound moral character, hon
est in all things and above all honest to
themselves and their race. Tie Impressed
this advice on their minds as being a
groat duty which he hoped every man
would fulfill.
He also appealed to his female audit
ors, beseeching them to maintain pure.
and virtuous characters, without which
the standard of the race could not be
maintained with a degree of dignity which
It ought to have as a raco.
At the. conclusion of the eloquent ad
dress the choir sang "Blest Be the Tie
That Hinds." The .-veiling service was
cli si d wit n a benediction from the pastor,
X.-v. T. Brown.

GOVERNOR GAGE ARRIVES.
Reaches the Palace and Shuts Him-
self Within His Room.
Governor Henry T. Gace arrived from
Sacramento last evening. He retired to his
apartments at the Palace and would give
no response to the many cards sent to
him. A most anxious crowd had gathered
in the court to welcome the Chief Execu
tive, but their fondest hopes were shat
tered by the asperity of the Governor,
whose individuality was two-fold last
night. Though "in," he was "not in."

~E. King, sailors; S. Furgisaiwa. cabin boy. and Hamada. cook.
by them, so for a whole month they lived 1
Â«b best they could and sailed the water
logged hulk 1450 miles Into safety.
Nineteen days after the disaster, when j
the transport Pennsylvania showed up,
the sailors would have deserted the j
JTesper in a body had Mi Sodergr* n ac
cepted a proffered passage to Nagasaki, j
hut she posit i' â  refused to leave her ,
husband and he would not leave his ves-l
pel. so all hands stayed .'the bark. The. .
officers of the Pennsylvania say it was i
one of the bravest and pluckiest acts they
evpr saw performed on the. ocean. There
was h vessel practically a wreck and un
s^eaworthy. Another storm would as
suredly have Bent her to the bottom, yet (
The- captain would not give up the ship,
the- wife would not leave her husband
and the crew would not desert . the ;
woman.
This must have been a very gratifying j
experience for Captain and Mrs. Soder- ]
grÂ«-". It is not so many years ago since i
two-of the, crew of the llesper were hanged j
for killing Second Mate Fitzgerald. They
also attempted to murder Captain Soder- j
gren and the first mate, after which it
as their intention to make for the coast
of South America with the vessel, taking
Mrs. Sodengren with them. Their plans
miscarried and the Hesper reached]
Tahiti, from which island the mutineers 1
were sent to San .Francisco in irons.
where the ringleaders were executed.
Chief Officer J. Ibsen Stousland of the
United States transport Pennsylvania was
in command of the boat that was sent to
render assistance to the waterlogged
Hesper. anil the accompanying- picture of
the bark Is from a snapshot taken from
â¢ he deck ot the transport.
"It was Tuesday, May 16, that we sight- |
ed the Hesper." said he yesterday. "We
had had rain and fog all night, but about
i) a. m. it cleared up a bit. At 8:60 a. m. '
1 turned In, but had to get out again, as
the quartermaster came and told me the
captain wanted/to see me. When i got !
on deck I saw we were steering for a
waterlogged hark with distress signals I
flying. At :':.".ij a. m. we were close up to
The vessel, so the engines were stopped
and a boat lowered. J took command of
ihÂ« boat, and we started for the ship. We
had to be very careful in getting along- I
side, as there was a nasty swell. She
was the well known bark Hesper of San
Francisco, Captain F. }'. Sodergren.
"She left Port Townsend, March 9, load
ed with heavy lumber for Kiaochau. a 1
new German naval station on the coast
line. On April 28 in latitude 22 degrees
â 'i minutes north, longitude 144 degrees
20 minutes east, not far away from the
Ladrone Islands, she ran into a severe
hurricane, and at midnight shifted her
immense deckload over to port, breaking
stanchions and bulwarks, and became
waterlogged. When the storm was over
she was listed over to port fully eight
planks, main rail several feet below the
water, cabin and all rooms full of wa- |
ter, provisions spoiled, oil given out and j
instruments, books, charts and clothes
ruined.
"With the ship in this condition and â 
handicapped as he was with his ruined
instruments. Captain Sodergren proceeded
toward his destination, and when I board
ed him lie was about one thousand miles
nearer Kiaochau that when disabled,
navlng covered that distance in nineteen
days.
"When I asked him if he was going to
abandon his ship he said that If we could
â  !. m half a barrel oi salt I and
some pork, and If possible twenty pounds
of sugar-yes and oil. he would proceed,
.. :,. that he could easily make the
lea yet to cover In 01 der to reach
Kiaochau.
'M thought we were In for a good Cat
palvage when I first boarded the wreck.
but before pluck like that all selfish
thoughts vanished. Here was a man with
a ship full of water, nothing to wear ex
cept Â« hat he stood in. his wife In the
same condition, living under a piece of
canvas on top of the deckload. 450 miles
from .â I., and yet both declined 1 0 leave
ihe ship. ! went back to the Pennsylvania
and got the provisions requested, and
v. i,. 11 he received thorn ' could sea it was
a relief to the captain. While the stuff
was being taken out if the boat Captain
isoaergren . his wile aiio myseii nan a lain
under 'the canvas.' He showed me his
only chart: it was wet. and all that he
had left of his Instruments, the alidade
(that portion of the quadrant that carries
the sights or telescope and shows the de
grees out off on the arc of the instru
ment). 1 tried to persuade his wife to
come to Nagasaki with us. but she stout
ly refused. With her husband she Bailed
and with him she was going to slnti or
swim. The fact of her remaining kept the
sailors from grumbling. Had she left and
come aboard the Pennsylvania,, they
would have deserted m a body.
"I spoke to the men. They were all
cheerful. Whether it was the sight of
the provisions or their natural disposition
I don't know, but In such circumstances
it was truly marvelous not to hear even a
murmur, and every man jack of them
ready to stay by the ship and confident
they would reach port as long as Mrs.
Bodergren remained with them.
"Mrs. Sodergren greatly Interested me.
She is a very intelligent woman and has
been used to all the comforts of life, and
perhaps to many of its luxuries, and yet
she preferred to tempt fate In a small tent
on the deckload of a waterlogged ship to
safety on the Pennsylvania. She had
three pets which she rescued from the
cabin after the storm. They were two
beautiful fats and a canary. During the
conversation I had with Captain Soder
gren and his wife the little bird made the
air musical with its melody. For it all the
world was gay. and It sang on as though
storms would never be heard of again.
"When 1 was ready to leave the Hesper
I noticed Captain Sodergrcn taking a
chew of tobacco. Tie apologized and said
he had not Indulged in that way for
eighteen years and his wife was disgust
ed, but added that he had to use tobacco
in some way and that was the only man
ner In which he could indulge, as there
was not a pipe left aboard. I asked him
If he would like a few cigars, and his eyes
lust snapped with delight. 1 went back
to the Pennsylvania and got Â» box from
the captain and took a box of mv own,
and with them I went back to the Hesper.
We stayed by the waterlogged vessel
three hours and then we both stood on
our course. When we left the Resper she
was in latitude 30 degrees 50 minutes
north, longitude 127 degrees 50 minutes
east, so they must have had favorable
winds all the way to reach Kiaochau in
twelve da vs."

SENSATIONAL
TESTIMONY WILL
BE INTRODUCED
Mrs. Mattie Crowley's
Startling Story.
SHE WILL TELL IT IN COURT
SAYS HER EX-HUSBAND IS TRY
ING TO RUIN HER.
Alleges That George Crowley Sought
to Induce Her to Enter Into a
"Badger" Blackmail
Scheme.
Testimony of a sensational nnd Bpicy ,
nature wilj be Introduced before Judge
Daingerfleld this morning when Mih. .Mat
tit- Crowley, the divorced wife of J.
George Crowley, bookkeeper for tbeUnion
1 Jet.- Company and well-known man about
town, takes the r:< tln her own behalf ;
i to testify in tlu' proceedings now pending
before the court affecting the custody of
their only child and the payment, of $26
I per month alimony for its support.
In an affidavit which will be presented ,
to the court by her attorney, Harry W.
Uutton, Mrs. Crowley charges that her
ex-husband attempted to Induce her to
enter Into a scheme to blackmail certain j
prominent business men with whom she
was acquainted. According to the affida
-1 vlt and statements made by Mrs. Crow
ley, Crowley unfolded the operations of
the famous "badger" game to lie:- a short
time ago, and suggested thai she accom
pany him to New York where he knew;
lit' many men of prominence and wealth
who might be easily blackmailed by a ,
woman of her beauty.
Mrs. Crowley sets forth in her affidavit
thai she spurned Crowley's alleged propo- '
sition, and she states that Bhe has not
been on speaking terms with him sine*;
he hail the audacity !â > unfold it to her.
in addition to these startling charges
Mrs. Crowley alleges that Crowley told
her pointblank that he would employ a
private detective to swear that she was |
an Impropi r person to care for her child it i
she did nol accede to h!s demands.
Wlnn the rase was first taken up by i
Judge Daingertteld, a few weeks ago, A. '
K. llamill. a private detective who whs
employed by Crowlej to shadow his di
vorced wife, tiled an affidavit In which
he claimed that Mrs. Crowley was escort
nl to the Poodle Dog restaurant on the
nigh! of April 22 by Sylvian Coblentz, re
maining there all that night.
Mrs. Crowley waxes Indignant over ,
HamiH's statements, and she expects to
prove bj the testimony of the lady with
whom she is now living that on the night ;
llamill Halms iii have seen her at tin- j
C lie Dog she was home in bed with
her five-year-old daughter. Mrs. Crow
ley alleges In her affidavit thai since she
was divorced from Crowiey she has nevei
remained away from home a single night, I
and tier attorney states that he will pro
duce ample testimony u< hear out her 1
statement.
in her affidavit Mrs. Crowle> allegi â 
that her ex-husband Is the companion of
a well-known tenderloin character, who
has apartments ai the Royal Kagle House
at th>- corner of Powell and lCllis streets. !
Crowley, she claims, has all but linked:
his name with the woman, and has es
corted her to picnics and theaters, and
has even gone so far as to parade tier up!
and down Market streel on sunny after
noons.
Mrs. Crowiey further states In her am"- j
davit that her ex-husband was at one
time am sted for parading the streets in I
;. male attire.
Mrs. Crowley was very reluctant to dis- !
cuss the embarrassing details of the mat- i
ter. "We are trying to settle this case i
with as little notoriety as possible," she |
â  X , ''.lined.
"But Mr. Crowley's allegations: an
they to go unchallenged?" was asked.
The mention of that name aroused her
Ire, and the woman who was once J.
<;.-,>[-Â£â¢â¢ Crowley's wife became Indignant.
â  Mrs. Crowle> "tenderly lifted her little
daughter from her kit* and sent her into 1
another portion of the house while she re
cited the sensational story which Is â¢-i
bodied In the affidavit which will be pre- |
. sented to the court this morning.
â¢"I had no idea of bringing these mat
ters to the notice of the court until Mr.
Crowley Introduced testimony <>r caused
'it to be Introduced which blackens m>
name. This attempt on his part to rob
me of my character is a burning outrage. .
The very thought of it aggravates me be
yond description. Mi Is simply trying to
throw mud on me for the purpose of get
: ting control of my baby girl.
"1 was divorced from Mr. Crowle>
about a year ago. 1 secured the divorce
on statutory grounds. I was given the
; custody of our baby and the court order
i ed him to pay me $23 per month alimony.
He complied with tti>-f onjers until lasi
January, lip to the time he was ordered
I to appear before Judge Daingerfleld and
; show cause why he did not. live up to the
conditions exacted by the court he had
not paid me a single rent. 1 was seated
in the Louvre one day with my brother
in-law when Crowley and a woman came
In. They sat down at a table dose to
ours and he ordered a bottle of wine, i
did nol notice him. for I am not in the .
habit of bowing to anybody who keeps :
company with that Hass of women. Just '
as we were ready to go Crowley left the i
I woman with whom he was seated and 1
came over to our table, l resented this
action -on his part and told him so. Mr.
Crowley thnw a letter on the table
I which lie had received from my attorneys" ,
in which they requested him to pay me
the back alimony he owed me. He insult
ed nif by calling me a vile name, and 1
, slapped his faro.
â¢\ have always borne .a good reputation
' and while 1 lived with Crowley I sought
to better his morals. Since we have been
divorced Mr. Crowley has been living with
a woman of the tenderloin. He was her
escort at the Eagles' picnic and has been
seen on the street with her in broad day
light. That is the kind of a man who de
filrfiS^O^&cl Control of. my baby."
SHARKEY HAS
A CHAT WITH
JEFF'S PAPA
Came Together on the
Train.
PREACHER AND PUG SHAKE
THE EVANGELIST GIVES TOM
SOME GOOD ADVICE.
Warns Him to Take Good Care of
Himself and Sets "Spider"
Kelly Right With Regard
to Himself.
Pugilist Tom Sharkey shook hands yes
terday with the Rev. Alexis C. Jeffries,
father of Champion Jim. They exchanged
a few remarks on the weather, some
others on the match that has just born
made by Brady and O'Rourke, a few good
wishes for each other's health, shook
liands some more and parted.
Tlie meeting occurred on the train
Which left Salinas at noon for the Oak
land mole. Sharkey, who had boxed four
rounds in that place the night before with
"Spider" Kelly, was ensconced on a seat
with that lively lightweight and Mr. Har
rington of Yalle.jo. an old-time friend of
his navy days. In another car was Jim
Jeffries' father, who had taken the train
at San J.tiis Obispo bent on an evan-
gelizing tour In San Francisco. Neither
the pugilist nor the father of Jeffries
was aware of his proximity to the
other and might have been ignorant of it
yet hail it not been for the intervention
of Artie i;iass. the news agent.
No sooner did Glass see Sharkey after
the train had pulled out of Salinas than
it occurred to him that the chance ,â¢;" .-(
lifetime had arrived. In an instant he re
solved to bring the two together. Acting
on the resolution he approached Shar
key.
"Say. Tom." he said. "Jim Jeffries'
father's in the other coach. Wouldn't
you like to meet him?"
"Sure," said Sharkey. jumping up.
"Cert." exclaimed the "Spider."
(Jlass headed in the direction of the
elder Jeffries, whom tli>- two found turn
ing over the leaves of a New Testament
he held in liis hand.
"Introduce me first." whispered Kelly
to (Jlass. "and I'll do the honors for
Sharkey.'
(,lass did as he was requested and side
stepped to allow the meeting of the
father of tin 1 champion and the sailor
who expects to make the son a has-been.
"Mr. Jeffries." said the "Spider," using
his most persuasive feint; "this is Mr.
Sharkey, who lias just been matched to
fight your son Jim f<n- $50,000."
Both men toed the scratch In Fine style
extending their rights and indulging in a
very cordial handshake. They each said
they were glad to see the other and smiled
pleasantly us if they rm-ant it. At the
invitation of the preacher the pugilists
took seats with him.
According to the chroni< ler of t ho meet
ing the 'â¢!(!- >r Jeffries took ;1 good look at
his son's only rival before opening OUI
Into conversation. Sharkey, who was
Looking his prettiest and dressed regard
less, hnre up well under the scrutiny.
"He's a fine-looking fellow," said Jef
fries, half to "Spider" Kelly and half to
himself, "but lie's not as hip as Jim.
They say." h<- continued, turning: to
Sharkey, "that you're a good fighter."
"That's what they tell me," said the
ex-sailor, blushing Immoderately.
"Well," said the other. "I don't approve
of fighting, hut I guess if It's In a man
it's hound to come out. If my son is
bound to ric;ht I suppose he'll tight till he
sets licked and then he'll ipiit. I'd just
as Boon see him thump a prize fighter as
to thump iron."
Here was the opportunity for which the
"Spider" had been waiting. Ky this time
he had come to the conclusion that the
elder Jeffries was a pretty plain spoken
man. and he concluded to ask him a
straight question or two.
"What kind of a man are you. anyway "
he asked, "to say you would iike to see
your son whipped? It don't sound natu
ral. My father came from Ireland and
you can bet your sweet life if I was a big
boy and a champion he wouldn't want to
see me licked."
"I never said." replied Jeffries, "that I
would like to see Jim whipped. 1 said I
thought he would he whlpned. In fact
could prophecy that he will be."
Sharkey was gulping in all this without
saying a word, satisfied tv let Kelly do

the leadinp. The last remark of the elder
Jeffries seemed to hit the liKht w.-Ight in
a sensitive spot.
â â¢('an you prophecy when ho will be
licked?" he ;isked, excitedly.
"] think so."
â 'Then.' said Kelly in a smpf whisppr.
"will you kindly give me a Up when it's
going to happen. I'd like to gvt in on It."
Sharkey and Kelly leaned over i losi to
the preacher to near his reply. After it
came they leaned back disgusted.
"Well." he said, "I'll keep that to my
self, ill not express an opinion."
A few more commonplaces and the
meeting ended, the evangelist shaking
hands with Sharkey and Kelly.
"Take care r >f yourself." he said to the
ex-sailor, as he was going into the next
car.
When \h>> passengers on the train reach
ed this side of the bay Sharkey was met
by his trainer. Tim McGrath.
"Hello, Tim." he said, "I met Jeffries'
dad on the train. Come over and I'll in
troduce you."
And McGrath trotted along to shake
hands with the champion's father. The
Rev. Mr. Jeffries scon slipped away in the
crowd and was lost to view. He is a
street preacher, without denomination,
traveling whither he wills and. visiting
his home between his trips Into the weedj
places in the Lord's vineyard, it is said
thai he intends to preach on the street
corners of this city for some time.
Sharkey took the ;irst boat for Vallejo
without stopping to make a call on city
friends. Before he embarked he had a
few words to say on the bijr match.
"I'll win sure." he said, "in less than
ten rounds at that. 1 never felt better in
my life, and I know what 1 can do with
Jeffries. When I meet him this time I'll
not be a sick man, as I was when 1 met
him before.
"I'll be back in town Tuesday and will
stay lure till the following Monday, when
1 start for the Bast. What I'll do after
that until 1 go into training I don'l know.
it's all in O'Kourke's hands."
Tim McGrath, under whose tutelage
Sharkey developed his powers, will make
tin Eastern trip with the sailor man. He
is frank in his belief that Sharkey will
prove the victor in the ro with Jeffries.
In support of this belief he strikes out in
a new line Of dope.
"Look at the number of times." lie said,
"that Jeffries landed on l'itz before he pot
him. What did Jeff do with Shark* y
when they met. Nothing in twenty
rounds. How often, then, will Jeff have
to hit Sharkey to knock him out? The
man that can tell will win the money.
They saj that Tommy Ryan made Jeff
Iho fighter he is. Well, if' Ryan can put
steam enough into Jeffries to knock out
Sharkey. he's a bigger boiler than the
boiler-maker ever saw before."
