SHERIFF FARLEY'S SLAYER ESCAPES
THE FURY OF THE PEOPLE OF SALINAS
Officers Smuggle Suesser
From the Scene of His
Atrocious Crime to
San Jose.
SALINAS. Sept. 19.âSa
linas is suffering to-day a
reaction from a night of
hysteria. People of the town
are gathered on every street cor
ner discussing in excitement the
tragic scenes of last night when
Henry R. Farley, the Sheriff of
Monterey County, was murdered
by an infuriated drunken wretch
who gave in murder and arson
a terrible climax to a worthless
life.
Business is practically sus
pended. With a fascination of
horror hundreds of men and
women are congregated at the
scene of the tragedy. Crowds
are assembled at the County Jail
to tell their regret that the mur
derer of the Sheriff did not re
ceive summary and desperate
justice for his crime.
Threats are made on even
hand that the criminal will never
be tried by process of law in the
county. Never, perhaps, in the
history of Monterey has a crime
so agitated the people, and armed
men are everywhere ready to re
venge the death of one who
seems to have won universal re
spect and good will. The mur
derer has been hastened out of
the county and smuggled to San
Jose, where he will remain until
people <>f Salinas have calmed
themseivrs sufficiently to permit
him to have the chance that the
law gives him for his life.
The mourning relatives of the
officer are gathered at his
coffin, and the people of the town
are preparing funeral ceremonies
that will testify their esteem oi
the man who was said to be the
most popular man in the county.
When daylight came this
morning the streets were dotted
with armed men prepared for any
desperate encounter. They had
been abroad for hours, and
they had watched with unremit
ting vigilance to lake the life of
the murderer.
It was perhaps an hour after
George Suesser had murdered
Sheriff Farley before the people
of the town knew that the officer
had been shot to death. Suesser.
it will be remembered, had
nursed his rage against Delaney
for hours. Suesser is hardly more
than a boy in years. He is a
worthless, drunken fellow, 22
years of age. He has won a pre
carious living by hunting, being
a dead shot and too lazy to fol
low a regular occupation. He
has been in trouble times without
number. He has been accused of
many minor offenses, but suc
ceeded by some streak of good
fortune from suffering punish
ment for them. Three days ago
he was accused by James 1 >e
laney of having stolen a harness.
The charge angered the young
fellow and he swore to be re
venged. He drank heavily dur
ing the day, and early in the
evening went to the home of De
laney. The old man answered
the call at the door, and when he
came Suesser struck him bru
tally and heavily with an iron bar.
Delaney escaped serious injury
through the assistance of his fam
ily, and Suesser reeled away
vowing that he would return and
kill the household.
As he left he drew his pistol
and fired several shots ,at the
house. Fortunately, he did no
damage, but his desperate nature
was aroused. He leaped a fence
and in drunken viciousness set
fire to a haystack owned by De
laney. In a moment the flames

THE FURY OF THE PEOPLE OF SALINAS
shot high into the air. A fire in
the very center of the town nat
urally created great excitement.
The alarm drew hundreds to the
scene, and in a few minutes the
neighboring streets were black
with people. The sound of the
pistol shots and the light of the
flames drew Constable Charles
Allen to the place. He saw the
drunken criminal just as he was
leaving the field. The officer
commanded Suesser to surren
der, and the reply was two pistol
bullets which went wide of their
mark.
After firing Suesser fled and
the officer gave chase. The young
man was too fleet of foot, how
i cevr, and reached his home,
; where he secured a shotgun. A
few minutes later he met the man
for whose murder he must now
answer with his life.
The alarms and the excitement
j had attracted the attention of
; Sheriff Farley, who had just re
! turned from the country and was
: dining in a downtown restaurant
; with ex-District Attorney P. E.
Zabala. They determined to
visit the scene of the fire, and on
the way they met Constable Al

There was a flash and a report,

In the meantime Farley had '

been carried to a neighboring
house, where he died shortly
after without regaining con
sciousness. The news of his
death spread like wildfire.
Officers were summoned and
they surrounded Suesser's
home. People flocked from their
Pictorial Storu of the Killing of Sheriff Farleu
at Salinas.
houses and hastened to the scene
of the crime. As they learned
the circumstances of the murder
they hurried back to their homes
to secure arms. Gunmakers
threw open their establishments
and told all that wished to arm
themselves and prepare to cap
ture the murderer. The town
had gone wild with rage over the
brutal crime of the drunken ras
cal.
It was not long before hun
dreds had congregated at the
Suesser house ready to hang the
murderer. Meanwhile the offi
cers were seeking for him. After
cutting his throat he had sought
refuge in the cellar and had
wedged himself between the
foundation and the ground. After
diligent search he was discov
ered. A board was wrenched
from the side of the house and
he was found blood-stained, chat
tering with fear and weak from
loss of blood. The muzzle of a
shotgun was placed at his head
and he was ordered to come from
his hiding-place. He did so, and
heard the angry roar of the
! throng of men who had sur
! rounded his home and were de
manding his life. He begged the
officers to kill him, but they se
cured a buggy near the house
and by a subterfuge escaped with
their prisoner. They made at
once for the outskirts of the
i town, and it was several moments
before shouts and curses an
j nounced that the crowd knew
i that their prospective prey had
escaped.
The throng then surged
toward the County Jail. News of
the murder had spread to neigh
boring towns, and in Gonzales
and Castroville armed men or-
ganized and hurried to Salinas.
Within an hour the roads were
patrolled by mounted armed men
ready to lynch the murderer.
But the officers were too clever.
They hastened their bleeding
prisoner out toward the Catholic
Cemetery, which is about two
miles from town. One of the of
ficers, James Church, left the
buggy and returned to the city
to endeavor to calm the people.
The other, M. R. Keef, con
tinued with his charge toward
the graveyard. He did not know
what to do. The roads seemed
guarded in every direction. By
taking a circuitous route he
reached the Howard ranch, near
Natividad, however, and there
the murderer rested until early
morning.
But the crowd of armed, rope
equipped men had not left the
jail during the long hours of the
night. They were waiting in
desperate patience for the com
ing of the murderer and his cap
tors. And with all their vigilance
they were outmatched. In the
early morning Suesser was
â  brought back to the town and to
I jail. He was smuggled into the
Sheriff's office, and the officers
I held a consultation. They de
cided that if they were to save
the life of their prisoner they
must get him out of the county.
Angry men were around the jail
and on every street corner. They
had kept their vigil through the
night, and failure had simply in
tensified their purpose.
After planning for nearly an
hour the officers succeeded in
getting a surrey to the rear en
trance of the jail. Suesser was
bundled into it and thrown on
the bottom of the vehicle.
Blankets were thrown over him,
the horses were lashed into a gal
lop, and the mob was cheated.
The officers made their way to
Sargents, where they took the
train for San Jose. All the way
Suesser declared piteously that
he never intended to kill the
Sheriff, who had been his friend.
''I wanted to kill Allen and De
laney," he cried, "and I am sorry
I did not."
After it became known that
Suesser had been taken out of the
county the mob dispersed. But
it has lost none of its bitterness,
and it will fare ill with the mur
derer if he is brought back while
If the Prisoner Is Returned
to Monterey County He
Will Surely Be
Lynched.
I the people of Salinas are in their
! present mood. They demand a
1 speedy revenge for the crime that
i has outraged the entire county.
To-day a stream of people has
passed in and out of the home of
Thomas Renison, where the
body of the dead Sheriff is rest-
ing.
The inquest was held this
morning and the Coroner's jun
charged Suesser with murder.
Coroner Muller, who has as
sumed the duties of Sheriff, has
sworn in five extra deputies to
assist in keeping the peace, but
there is no likelihood of trouble
unless the murderer is brought
back.
The funeral of Sheriff Farley
will take place at 10 o'clock-
Thursday morning. It will be
held under the direction of the
Native Sons and the Odd Fel
lows, of which orders the dead
officer was a prominent member.
SUESSER TALKS OF
HIS MANY CRIMES
SAN JOSE, Sept. 19.â George Suesser.
the murderer of Sheriff Farley, occupies
the cell which formerly held Tiburcio
Vasquez, the notorious Mexican bandit,
in the little tank at the County Jail to
night. The iron bedstead and every
thing has been removed from the cell
so that he cannot kill himself, and Jail
er Rives is keeping close watch on the
prisoner. He lies on a mattress on the
floor, with a couple of blankets over
him.
Suesser was sleeping as soundly and
unconcernedly as an innocent babe to
night when aroused to be interviewed.
He exhibits no remorse for his crime.
Buesser readily consented to sit for his
picture for The Call photographer this
afternoon. He adjusted his attire and
seemed to want to make a good picture.
To-night he quickly answered ques
tions put to him. He said he was sorry
he killed Farley, whom he said was a
friend of his, and that he had no reason
to kill him. The Sheriff did not speak.
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
to him, and he did not know whom ha
was shooting: at.
"Constable Allen and Delaney have
persecuted me in every way," said
! Suesser. "Four times the former ar
: rested me, and each time I was turned
| loose. Yesterday he wanted to arrest
jme again. This became tiresome, and
i last evening I concluded to even up
I matters. I began drinking, but before
doing so I had decided to kill Delaney
and Allen and then give myself up. I
j went to Delaney's house for the pur
i pose of killing him. If he had come
, out I would have shot him. I did not
hit him with the iron bar, but with my
! fist. I fired three or four shr,-ts through
! the house, but shot too high. That was
! merely to bring Delaney outside. "When
j I ran across Farley I thought it was
Allen, and I shot to kill him. I waa
drunk at the time, but realized what I
was doing. Had Ito do the whole busi
i ness over again I would do the same.
i I felt that if I killed Delaney and Allen
\ and even hung for it I would feel well
i repaid. No, I am not filled with re
' morse nor repentance and don't care
what becomes of me. Yes, I set the
fire?, too."
Suesser has a deep gash around his
throat and is badly powder burned be
tween the eyes. He is not shot in the
stomach, as was at first supposed. In
regard to the wounds he said: "After
the shooting I decided to kill myself. I
went under the house. The muzzle of
a gun I placed to my forehead and
pulled the trigger. It happened that
; there was a blank cartridge in the gun,
which accounts for my failure. The
concussion knocked me down, but I
soon got up. I then grabbed my pocket
! knife and tried to kill myself. It was
j dull and did not reach a vital place.
Before I could do any more damage I
was arrested."
The front of Suesser's shirt is covered
i with blood and he must have bled pro
fusely.
Suesser was taken to the County Jail
'by Deputy Sheriffs Wallace and
Hughes. They arrived at San Jose on
the 2:45 train. Deputy Sheriff Wallace
! gives great credit to Deputies Keefe
: and Nesbitt. They all had a hard time
j to protect Suesser, and although they
i had great animosity toward him, de
j cided to protect him at all .hazards.
AN INQUEST HELD
BY THE CORONER
SALINAS, Sept. 19.â Coroner Muller
held an inquest this morning on the
'. remains of Sheriff Farley. The follow
ing men constituted the jury: H. S.
Ball, F. W. Schmechel. Warren John
son, C. B. Butler, John Tucker. S. J.
Westlake, John Kalar, A. F. Fulton. C.
J. Fulle and J. W. Rowling. After roll
call the jurors were taken to the resi
dence of Thomas Renison. where they
i viewed the remains, and were then
! sworn In. The jurors then returned to
the office of the Coroner, where the in
; quest was proceeded with.
Ex-District Attorney P. E. Zabala
| was the chief witness. He was in the
Sheriff's company from 3:30 continu
ously until the time of the shooting.
They had been out to the Corral de
Troca. Returning about 9:30, they drove
to Mr. Keef's house and left the horse.
They returned to the grill and got sup
per. While there the fire alarm
sounded.
Farley said he would go down town
!to the fire. Witness told him there
would he no use going there and that
the proper place to go was to Suesser's
house if we wanted to find out anything
about the fire. Upon arrival there they
heard loud talking. Suesser's parents
were remonstrating with him. but he
seemed very much excited and said he
was going to kill Delaney. Suesser
went out into the street, continuing his
cursing and threatening. Farley spoke
to him and said: "George, George, be
quiet," but Suesser said: "Stand back.
you . or I'll shoot you. too."
Farley said: "Oh, no, you won't.
George, don't you know who I am?"
and he replied: "Yes, I know who you
are." Farley then urged Suesser to
come back home and behave himself.
Suesser then turned to Farley and
lifting his gun to his shoulder, said:
"Stand back! Stand back! Stand
back!" and upon repeating it the third
time pulled the trigger, the charge
taking effect in Farley's fa<-". When
Suesser fired his father was on the
sidewalk and his mother and brother
were in the yard. They screamed: "Oh,
my God, he has killed an innocent man.
Take him and hang him; he ought to
be killed."
"When we went to the house search
ing for Suesser," continued the witness,
"his folks again reiterated what they
had said and requested us to hang him.
Suesser did not appear to be under the
influence of liquor, but spoke with the
deliberation of one seeking blood. The
Sheriff's pistol was in his pocket. He
had never drawn it."
Marshal Allen testified that he had
the gun of Suesser: that he helped to
capture him from the place of hiding.
When he was pulled out he begged for
a pistol, stating that he would take his
own life.
The Coroner did not deem It neces
sary to introduce further evidence and
gave the case to the jury.
The jury returned the following ver
dict: "We, the Coroner's jury sum
moned to inquire into the cause of the
death of Henry Rled Farley, find that
deceased was shot in the head with
buckshot by George Suesser; that the
shooting was done with intent to kill."2

LEAGUE OF AMERICAN
MUNICIPALITIES MEETS
Members Discuss Matters Appertain-
ing to the Health and Better
Government of Cities.
SYRACUSE, N. Y'., Sept. 19.â third
annual convention of the League of
American Municipalities opened here to
day with 400 delegates in attendance, and
many more are expected to arrive to
morrow. Mayor Maguire of Syracuse
made the address of welcome to the city.
Governor Roosevelt, who was to have de
livered the address of welcome to the
State, telegraphed that he could not be
present. Former Mayor Sewell L. Black
of Columbus, Ohio, president of the
league, responded to the addresses of
welcome.
In his annual address President Black
outlined the purposes of the convention.
Mayor Samuel L. Jones of Toledo made
the principal address of the day. He
spoke upon the subject: "The New
Patriotism, a Golden Rule Government."
Following Mayor Jones, the secretary
and treasurer made their annual reports.
Secretary B. F. Kilklnson stated that,
although the league was but twoyearsof
age, it had on its membership rolls cities
representing about one-sixth the entire
population of the L'nlted States. At the
date of his last report, August 1, 1898,
the league had a membership of seventy
two cities; since then fifty-two cities have
been added to membership. The bureau
received during the year 782 special let
ters of Inquiry, relative to municipal af
fairs. Not having a skilled architect
and a civil engineer, the bureau was un
able to provide all the Information called
for in some cases. The secretary recom
mended that a consulting engineer be re
tained by the league when the revenue of
the organization shall be sufficient to
meet such expense.
The remainder of the afternoon session
was given up to papers and discussions
on "Collection and Disposal of Garbage."
J J. Williams, Mayor of Memphis, Tenn., |
and H. J. Gonden, editor of City Govern
ment, New York, argued in favor of cre- I
mation as the best method of destroying
the waste matter of cities.

Heavy Claim.
SENSATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS

WOMAN IS A NIECE OF LUCKY
BALDWIN.
Some of the Heirs Are Willing to
Make a Compromise to Keep
the Case Out of the
Courts.
FseHal Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, Sept. 19.-There will be a
contest of the will of the late James T.
Murphy, and the past life of the deceased
will be uiiid in court ami many sensa
ti.mal f.-;itures of his career disclosed. The
initial stop in the matter was taken this
afternoon, when a suit was filed in the Su
perior Court by Bertha Smalley of San
Francisco against the Union Trust Com
pany, the e/ecutor of Murphy's cstatei
for (24,000, alleged to be due for services.
Kor live years previous to Murphy's
death Miss Smalley was almost bis sole
companion, and administered ti> his
wantÃ. They lived at the Lamolle House,
and It is siiid Murphy frequently intro
duced her as his wife. The indebtedness,
the complaint states, was contracted be
tween February, I*!*, and November 16,
LB9B, during which time it is alleged Miss
Smalley "performed work and labor and
rendered services to said James T. Mur
phy, decedent, at his request, in the ca
pacity of must' and attendant."
It is stau-u the services were reasonably
worth $24,000, a:<d all became due and
payable on November 16 last The claim
>i as presentee to the Union Trust I'om
pany on Jum - (| . l v ;<y, but rejected by the
executor, suit is Drought to enforce the.
claim, and will certainly lead to a content

TESTIMONY IN
DESIRELLO CASE
Principal Witness Goes
on the Stand. â¢
SAW THE CRIME COMMITTED
JOHN VACCARI TELLS HISSTORY
TO THE JURY.
District Attorney Bullock Does Not
Hope for a Conviction for Mur-
der, but Merely Man-
slaughter.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
REDWOOD CITY, Sept. 19.â The tak- I
ing of testimony In the Desirello murder j
trial commenced this afternoon about 2 j
â¢ '(luck. The entire day up to that time i
was occupied in selecting the jury. In j
all ninety talesmen wore questioned. ]
From their examination it can be seen j
that the strong feeling that existed
against defendant at the time of the kill
ing has materially lessened. Many of
them were disqualified for the reason that
they had formed opinions from . news
paper items read by them. The jury
sworn to try the case is composed of the
following men:
David Barre, Alexander Moore, John
Kerr, Samuel Nash Jr., K. Schubert, K.
Dulac, W. H. Adams. Eugene O'N.eill,
George p. Adair, John Kowell, J. M.
Beckley and r. 1.. Wood.
In Ins opening statement to the jury
District Attorney Bullock told them that
he would not ask for a conviction of
murder, but that from the evidence that
should be introduced he would expect a
verdict of manslaughter. In the first
trial none of the jurors voted for murder,
though nix st. M>d for manslaughter.
The lirst witness called by the prosecu
tion was \v. is. Gilbert, County Surveyor.
The purpose of this testimony was to
identity and explain a drawing and plan
of the territory in the. neigh oor hood of
the White House anil Belli's store at
Colma, where ilie shooting occurred.
The only other witness examined to-day
was John \ accari, the young man who
was driving the team in which young
Johnston was riding at the time he was
shot. Vacccari and a young man by the
name of Henry Jensen, who was also in
the wagon, are the two principal wit
nesses tor the prosecution. Vaccari was
put through a severe cross-examination
by Mr. Walker, who with B. R Kilz
patrick, is conducting the defense.
On his direct examination Jenaon testi
fied that he was working for a man by
the name of Bauman on the lMh of last'
March and on the evening of that day
tie left the ranch of Mr. Bauman in com
pany with James Johnston and v man by
the name of Furger for Belli's store in
Colma to get some hay. When he reached
the switch near the White House he
stopped to let Mr. Kuriier off the wagon,
and there took on young Jensen, the lat
ter accompanying him and Johnston to
the store. Opposite the White House a
man Btepped out toward the wagon and
then back again. He passed the man a
few feet, when a shot was fired. He kept
on, and a s* bond shot was tired. By
this time he had almost reached the store
and was making a long turn when a third
shot was tired, and it was then that
Janus Johnston called out, "I'm shot.",
Johnston jumped from the wagon and ran
to the porch of the store and grasped the
iron bars on the window with one hand.
Tht other hand he held to the back of his
neck. Witness said he jumped from the
wagon and went to the assistance of the
wounded boy. He had no more than
reached him when Desirello ran up. About
the same time defendant's wife appeared
and said to her husband: "My God,
Frank, what have you done?" to which
he replied: "1 don't give a ; 1 shot to
kill. " Witness was about to testify that
he was rebuking Desirello for shooting at
them, but the court ruled the testimony
I out.
Dpsirello. according to thp witness,
! caught Johnston as he was about to fall
and held him In his arms, at the same
time asking his wife for some whisky.
A crowd Soon gathered around and he
was sent to Ocean View for a doctor.
When he returned the boy was dead.
I'pon cross-examination the witness ad
mitted that Desnollo said he shot to kill
the horses and meant the boys no harm.
Up further admitted that at the Coroner's
Inquest and at the preliminary examina
tion he had testified that the defendant
had said he shot to kill. This admission
is in line with the defense made by de
fendant on the first trial.
Henry Jensen will be examined in the
morning. The case will probably go to
the jury some time on Friday.
DIG A TUNNEL
TO ESCAPE
Vain Attempt of Bull

Special I>i!:.atrh to The Call.
AVARDNER, Idaho, Sept. 19.â Only thÂ« i
vigilance of Sergeant Elltchman prevented -,
the larger portion of the prisoners now
In custody at the bullpen rmm disappear
i ins into the night. Sergeant Elttchman
was BUBpi clous that some movement was
! on, and began a search, ruder the floor
of the lift bunkhouse, in the northeast
corner of the Inclosure, he found a large
quantity of new <lirt. There was also a I
new ii"i there, into which one of the sol-;
i diers descended and made an exploration.
The men in search of liberty had bur
; rowed for a distance of sixty-five feet in
, the hard soil characteristic of ihls partjc
' ular locality, and had only thirty feet I
! more to go when the tunnel would have j
; brought them to daylight under the bluff,
I screened from the observation of the men
guarding them. The tunnel was about
' twenty-five inches In diameter, of neces- j
I slty untlmbered, and was just large
enough for a man to crawl along.
Tools had been constructed in an mi
i genlous manner. An Improvised box was
put on runners. To each end a long rope
was attached, the rope being made of
spliced pieces. One man burrowed, using
for a light a candle placed in the bottom
!of a broken bottle. When he had filled
| the box with dirt the man at the other
1 end, at a signal, would haul the box to the
bunkhouse, empty it, and the burrower â 
would haul it back and fill it again. A i
butcherkn-fe. a crowbar, twisted wire and j
j other similar appurtenances were used by
the man underground. He made fast (
â  progress, for it is known that the work i
I had continued only two days. The tunnel
! was so small that the man working in
side had to crawl out on his stomach when
! he had completed his shift.
WORKMEN OF FEDERAL
BUILDING ON A STRIKE
Bricklayers and Stonemasons Object
to Work Done by Non-Union
Men on a Cornerstone.
CHICAGO. Sept. 19*-A formal strike of
bricklayers and stonemasons employed
on the new Federal building was ordered
to-day. The foundation for the corner
stone, which is to be laid by President
McKinley during the fall festival in Oc
tober, was built last Sunday. The work
was done by union masons, but under a
sub-contract from John R. Peirce. who
has the contract for the stone "work of
the Federal building. Few men are af
fected, but unless the strike is settled
it will probably prevent the laying of the
cornerstone.
The strike grievance will be brought
before the Building and Trades Council
Friday night, and unless the disagree
ment between the labor unions and Con
tractor Peirce over the cornerstone,
which it is claimed was cut by non-union
labor, is settled all work on the postoffice
will be stopped.
New Cases of Yellow Fever.
KEY WEST. Sept. 19.â Thirty-one new
cases of yellow fever were reported in the
past twenty-four hours and one death.
SUMMONSES ISSUED
FOR CABINET COUNCIL
England and the Transvaal Continue
Making Preparations for War.
LONDON, Sept. 19.â Summonses were !
issued late this afternoon for a Cabinet
council which It is understood will be
I held Friday. This is regarded as the j
1 result of the visit of the Premier, Lord i
1 Salisbury, to London, whither he came |
I this afternoon, remaining at fhe For
eign Office from 4:30 p.. m. to 6:30 p.
Im. Mr. Chamberlain, Secretary of
State for the Colonies, was present in
the building at the same time, and as j
a private doorway connects the offices
it is presumed that the summonses
were the result of their joint delibera
tion.
The lack of all excitement in official
j circles bears evidence to the deliberate
' manner in which the highest officials
j are handling the crisis. Nor is it by
| any means certain that the Cabinet
| council will adopt extreme measures,
in spite of the uncompromising nature
of the Boer reply. This deliberation on
i the part of the Government is inter
! preted not only in London but in other
: European capitals as a desire on the
part of Great Britain to gain time while
the troops are hurrying to Cape Colony.
The Berliner Ntuieste Nachrichten,
j commenting on this to-day, says: "The
present calm is only meant to deceive
the Boers. When' England feels equal
to the task of facing the Boers this
I peaceful tone will give way to a blatant
i cry for war."
Even rumors of a movement of the
' Boers across the Natal border appar
! ently fail to excite the military authori
j ties here, who profess at least not to
fear such a contingency for the present.
In the meantime the movement of
troops proceeds. The Royal West Sus
; sex Regiment left to-day for Malta,
where it will replace the first border
i regiment, which goes by the same
j steamer to Natal.
It is announced this afternoon that
the British first-class protected cruisers
â  Terrible and Powerful have been or
dered to the Cape. They have reliefs
! on board capable of forming a naval
brigade of a thousand men.
Ine steamer Jelunga will take 500
troops bound for Natal to-morrow, and
sly will embark a rifle brigade at the
â¢ island of Crete for the Cape.
According to a dispatch from Dur
ban, Natal, the Premier of the Colony
says that the alarm of the people of
Natal at the unprotected condition of
â  the border towns is quite unwarranted
and that all efforts to incite the Zulus
; have failed.
The lull in the crjsis gives opportunity
TO EXPERIMENT WITH
WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY
Orders Issued for Captain George
Squier of the Signal Corps to
Commence the Work.
WASHINGTON, Sept. 19.â Wireless tel
egraphy is to be given a practical trial in
the vicinity of New York by the sipnal
i corns of the army. Secretary Root to-day
i Issued this order:
"Captain George O. Squier, United
! States Volunteer Signal Corps, will pro
ceed from this city to New York City and
Fire Island, New York, and Navesink.
New Jersey, "ii official business pertain
ing to the signal corps of the army, and
on the completion of this duty will return
to his station In this city via New York
City. N. Y. The travel is necessary for
i public service."
The extent of the experiments Captain
| Squier will make has not been det.r
mined, but he will make all necessan ar-
I rangements and report their completion
at the department. Experiments by the
signal corps with wireless telegraphy up
to this time have been confined to efforts
made to communicate between the depart
ment and Port Meyer, a distance of four
miles and the results have been quite
satisfactory. Better results are expected
1 in the proposed experiments, because of
more favorable conditions under which
they will be made.

PARIS. Sept. 19.â The Council of
Minister? decided to-day to pardon
Dreyfus in principle. The pardon
will take effect in a few days.
Dreyfus has relinquished his appeal for
a reversal of the Judgment of the court
martial.
It is Bald that Dreyfus will be sent
abroad before the promulgation of his
pardon in order to avoid demonstra
tions.
"In principle" is an idiom sometimes
used in semi-official announcements of
forthcoming actions. It Beems to have
but light bearing on the matter, except,
perhaps, that it implies the fulfillment
of various formalities before the par
don is actually issued, therefore quali
fying: the announcement of the pardon
with slight tentativeness. It is not
known yet whether the pardon includes
amnesty.
There is much remark here on the
strange coincidence of the death of M.
Seheurer-Kestner, the first champion of
Dreyfus, and to whom Dreyfus will vir
tually owe his freedom, on the very day
the Cabinet d< cided to pardon the pris
oner.
The decision of the Cabinet to par
don Dreyfus created less interest in
Paris than would the result of a big
horse race. In fact, it may hi> said that
it caused no excitement whatever.
There was n<> riotinp: on the boulevards.
In front of the offices of the Libre Pa
rule, where a crowd usually assembles
in the evening to gaze upon the huge
rendes outside th^ win
dows of the leading anti-Semite orean.
there was not the slightest gathering
or the faintest sign of demonstration,
either for or against Dreyfus.
would think that the fire of the
Dreyfus agitation had burned itself out.
The anti-Dreyfusard evening papers

ent's action by a rabid attack
upon President Loubet, but their efforts
were futile. The peaceful crowds that
filled the tables in front of the cafes,
u r their after-dinner coffee, lodked

violent headlines, but utterly refused
t.p p. Tlv majority did not
even discuss the matter or only made
the passing remark that the decision
was just as had been expected and pre
dicted by every Parisian newspaper
since the Rennes court-martial deliv
ts verdict.
The anti-Dreyfusard newspaper, Poir. ;
had the most sensational caption, two
lin^s of enormous letters extending :
- the entire front page announc- !
ing "The Traitor Dreyfus Pardoned;
Outrage on the Army." Then, in the j
of an article violently attacking
President Loubet, it said: "Loubet has
given himself a coup de grace in par

GUERIN AND COMPANIONS
SURRENDER TO THE POLICE
rhe Six Weeks 1 Siege of "Fort Chabrol" Ends in
a Sublimely Ridiculous Style.
PARIS Sept. 20. â M. Guerin surrendered at five minutes to 4 o clock this
morning without firing a shot, and was conveyed to prison. His com
panions, fourteen in number, were allowed to go free. Thus the six
weeks 1 siege ended in sublimely ridiculous style.
Preparations were made to storm "Fort Chabrol." Guerin's strong
hold. At half past 2 o'clock this morning the colonel of the Garde Republi
calne accompanied by two officers, arrived at "Fort Chabrol," followed later
by a body of mounted guards and a company of guards afoot. At a Quar
ter past :, fours' ated cabs arrived with an ambulance to take off the pris
oners and wounded in case of an assault. A company of engineers from
Versatile* a company of firemen and a prefect of police next came. Prep
arations were then made to take the fort after three summones by roll of
drum. Then the surrender was made.
Th.- Government had decided to flood the fort if Querin had refused to
surrender and had a couple of hundred firemen with steam pumps, fire es
capes ."iid miles of hose- All the buildings around were filled with police
and municipal guards. Guerin's house is lower than the surrounding edi
fices and the firemen were placed on upper stories of the latter, overlook
ing the fort, prepared to turn on the water as soon as the signal should be
Kiven. while below, in the street, the engines were snorting as the firemen
fed the furnaces and kept steam at top pressure.
Infantry officers and officers of the municipal guard paced up and down
during the hours of waiting, glancing up at the windows of the fort, from
which, in the dim, gray light of the early morning, could be distinguished
a black flag, hoisted from the second floor by Guerin, and a white sheet
hanging down with the device in black letters, "Vive I'Annee" and "A bas
les traiteurs."
When M. Guerin's companions separated they took coaches and were
driven *ff. Chanteloube joined his parents. Then the troops departed, fol
lowed by the municipal guards and the police, except a few who remained
in the Rue de Chabrol to keep order. An immense crowd lingered to
the end to watch the proceedings and then dispersed with little or no dis
turbance.
THE LATE M. SCHEURER-KESTNER.
DEATH CLAIMS THIS
DREYFUS CHAMPION
PARTS. Sept. 19. â M. Seheurer-Kestner. former vice president of the
Senate and a champion of Dreyfus, is dead. M. Scheurer-Kestner's
death was sudden. He had been ill during the last few days, but it
was not thought that his illness would prove fatal.
M. Auguste Seheurer-Kestner, the former vice president of the
French Senate and foremost champion of the cause of Dreyfus, was born
February 11. 1833, at Mulhouse, Alsace, from which place the Dreyfus fam
ily also hailed. He was president of the Chemical Society of Paris and
was a prominent member of a number of other societies. He was political
director of the Republique Francaise from 1579 to 1884, and was a Repub
lican in politics. He took a great interest in the improvement of the work
ing classes, and in I^." founded a co-operative, society for their benefit. His
republican ideas in I*>'> 7 caused him to be sentenced to four months' impris
onment and 2000 francs' fine. He was elected to the National Assembly in
1871, and in 1875 he was first elected to the Senate, of which he afterward
became one of thÂ»- secretaries and eventually one of the vice presidents. He
was defeated for re-election as vice president January 13, IS9S. He has
written extensively on chemistry.
LONDON, Sept. lfl.â The afternoon newspapers comment chiefly upon
the death of M. Seheurer-Kestner, comparing its dramatic features with the
deaths of Nelson and Wolfe at the moment of victory. M. Seheurer-Kestner
had been suffering for two weeks from typhoid fever.

lectuns in England and America on the

LONDON, Sept. 20.â The Rennes cor
respondent of the Daily Telegraph,
wiring at 9 o'clock last evening, sain:
"There is reason to believe that Drey
fus is already out of prison and that
with his wif>- he will probably leave
Rennes to-night."

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL., WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 20. 1899.
CLOSE CALL
OF TROOPS ON
MORGAN CITY
Transport Was Beached Just
as She Was About to
Go Down.
BsecUU IMsivitch to The fall.
YOKOHAMA, Sept. 8, via Victoria,
B. C, Sept. 19.â Interesting details are
at hand of the wreck of th.-> American
transport Morgan City in the inland
i sea of Japan. It appears that it came
very near being an appalling catas
trophe.
Striking upon a reef at 3 o'clock in
. the morning the ship remained fast un
â  til daylight, when by adopting the ex
pedient of rushing the men alternately
; from one side to the other the ship was
j rolled from the rocks into deep water,
where she at once began to fill rapidly.
She headf^l for the shore of the island
of Inoshima, several miles distant,
sinking perceptibly with every yard of
progress. She reached the beach barely
; a minute before otherwise going under.
â  The discipline of the men was admir
; able and all were gotten ashore in
safety.
The seamanship shown appears not
i to have been so admirable, as no pre
! cautions were taken to make the bow
( fast to the shore after beaching. The
i day was spent in removing stores, the
| transport lying very nearly bow un
der, but well afloat in the afterpart.
Later In the afternoon, without warn
ing, she slid off the steep beach and
i sunk in about six fathoms. A more
favorable or picturesque spot for a
' shipwreck could scarcely be found. The
island of Inoshima is about a dozen
miles from Hiroshima, the chief city of
| the inland sea. Almost instantly came
â  aid from the Japanese authorities, the
â  cruiser Yosohome being at once dis
] patched and the Red Cross Society
1 sending a relief expedition. The troops
; are loud in their appreciation of Japan
i ese kindness.
A pleasant episode for the shlp-
I wrecked men was the passing of the
| scene by the Empress of India. She
stopped for some hours and proffered
everything which could foe done in the
way of aid.
The damage by the recent typhoon
which swept the whole southern portion
: of Japan is even greater than at first
! reported. The appalling subsidence of
; the Bosshi mine in the island of Shiko
!ku entailed the loss of 600 lives. From
s<>me parts of the south reports still
| come in of hundreds of houses de
i stroyed, while every prefecture counts
jby hundreds its dead. An interesting
: incident in the Besshi mine catastrophe
was the final saving of five miners who
had been imprisoned in the earth for
Fix days by the caving In of the en
trance. ____^

FILIPINOS
MAY RELEASE
PRISONERS
Ask for Permission to Hold
a Conference With Gen
eral Otis.
SDeclal Dispatch to The Coll.
WASHINGTON, Sept. 19.â Secretary
Root to-day received a cablegram from
General Otis that seemed to indicate a
weakening on the part of the insur
gents In Luzon. It contained a proffer
to deliver the American prisoners who
have been for bo many months in the
hands of the insurgents, and also
sought permission to parley with Gen
eral Otis.
This cablegram was at once taken by
Secretary Root over to the Cabinet
meeting and formed the main topic for
discussion at the beginning of the Cab
inet session. However, upon reading ,
the message carefully its apparent ira
' portance seemed to diminish.
Secretary Root himself did not regard
the matter as of Importance at this
j'time. He recalled frequent efforts on
the part of the insurgents In the past
to gain time at critical moments by
! opening negotiations, ostensibly with
i the object of making $eace, and +ie was J
! not sure but this last offer wate some
thing of the same kind. However, the
! Secretary was of the opinion that it \
â  would fail to afford the insurgents any
I advantage. General Otis would receive
' any messenger and listen to him and
; make answer to his proposals, but this j
; would not restrain the military opera- i
tions in the slightest degree, and the
American arms would lose no ground,
no matter how the negotiations turned I
' out. There is a possibility also that the
! Insurgents may have become disheart-
I ened at the renewed and intense actlv
| ity in the direction of reinforcing Gen
i eral Otis and concluded, in view of the I
j great force gathering to open the cam- |
paign in the dry season, that further
! resistance would be useless.
It is pointed out as a noticeable fact
I that Aguinaldo's name does not appear
1 in General Otis" dispatch, and though
I this may not be of great significance.
i still among some of the army officials
! it Is surmised that there are serious
i dissensions among the insurgents and
I that, perhaps, some of the discordant
L elements are acting on their own re
sponsibility. The text of the dispatch
is as follows:
MANILA Sept. 19.â Adjutant General,
Washington: General Mac-Arthur reports ,
from Angeles the visit of two insurgent ;
. officers with a rr;iu<-st for permission to
send Into our lines American prisoners
mill :â¢' send to Manila a prominent Insur
| gent general officer for a conference. The
requested Interview was granted and the j
: Insurgent officers at Angeles return north j
this morning with Information. OTIS.
The capture of Lieutenant Gilrnore j
and his party was one of the most stir
ring incidents of the insurrection. It
occurred while the cruiser Yorktown
j was making a survey of the western
j coast of Luzon with a view to locating
some of the detached Spanish garrisons
which had long been cut off from the
populous centers. It was known that
a Spanish garrison had been SUITOUnd
! t-d at Baler, on the eastern coast, and
Lieutenant Gilmore, with a boat's party
from the Yorktown, was sent ashore to
reconnoiter the surrounding cotrntry.
He divided his command, one party re
maining near the shore, while another
pushed inland. This was the last heard
of the lieutenant and the fifteen men
who accompanied him. The other mem-
J bers of the party waited for a long
time, but got no trace of their compan
ions, and finally were obliged to return
to the ship without them.
Admiral Dewey at once reported the
loss to the Navy Department and be
fore he left Manila used every possi
ble means to learn the condition of the
captive Americans. At first it was
feared they had lost their Jives, but
later definite information was received
that the following were alive at San
Isidro, an insurgent stronghold:
Lieutenant Gilmore, Chief quarter
master Walton. Sailmakers" Mate Paul
Vandoit, Coxswain John Elsworth, Ap
prentice Peterson (third class). Lands- |
man Silvio Hrisolez, Landsman Lvman
Paul Edwards and Landsman Fred An
derson.
Captain Charles M. Rockefeller of the
Nineteenth Infantry is also supposed
to be a prisoner with the insurgents.
He disappeared last April and no trace
of him has been discovered.

WHITE MAN'S
BURDEN IN THE
PHILIPPINES
The Unitarian Club
Discusses It.
THE Duties of Civilized Nations To
ward the Uncivilized was the sub
ject for discussion last night at the
annual meeting of the Unitarian
Club of California. It was dis-
cussed at the Merchants' Club in
the Mutual Life building after one of the
most enjoyable dinners ever given by the
organization. Fully 200 members and
guests sat at table and enjoyed the dis
cussion that followed. President Sheldon
G. Kellogg presided, and arranged near
him were the gentlemen underlined for
addresses on the subject. Hon. John Bar
rett, ex-Minister to Siam. was at his left,
and Professor Thomas Bacon of the Uni
versity of California at his right. Many
other distinguished guests were present.
In announcing The subject for discussion
President Kellogg said it might properly
be called "the white man's burden," and
he called upon Professor Bacon to lend
the first hand to pass it along.
Professor Bacon opened with the state
ment that the question was by no means
a new one. Many solutions had been of
fered in times cone by, and now a new
solution was offernble. The problem first
arose, he said, when the first discoveries
of the lifteenth and sixteenth centuries
laid open to the east coast of Europe a
multitude of men, alien in race and color,
for whom no provision had been made in
the medieval system of European thought.
Rudely and crudely the Europeans of
those times set about solving the ques
tion what to do with them.
"The first answer," continued Professor
Bacon, "was direct and easy. It seems a
hard answer to us. It seems one which
could only be suggested by the cruelest
instincts of man, but we misjudge those
persons, who had to solve that problem
and solve it suddenly, if we suppose
that there was really in their heart no
gentleness, no consideration, no human
Instinct. Their theory of how the civil
ized races of the world ought to treat the
uncivilized racesâ how the white man
ought to treat the man that was not
white â was very simple; the white man
ought to enslave the black man. Every
consideration of interest and religion
pointed to this solution of the problem.
What arrangement corfld be better than
that which should give money to the
white man in this world and eternal sal
vation to the black man in the next?
"Portugal and Spain had been- the ex
ponents of this first theory and England
and Holland of the other," continued the
speaker. "Their theory was that they
should go out and seize the outlying
parts of the earth, inhabited or uninhabi
ted, and use them for their own behoof.
"Very little religious zeal," said Professor
Bacon, "went into the upbuilding of the
British Empireâ very little religious zeal,
indeed. A few colonists on the east coast
of this continent were actuated by the
religious sense, and founded communities
for conscience sake; but mighty little re
ligion had that fine old pirate, Sir Fran
cis Drake, as he chased the galleons of
the Spanish king and captured them for
himself and his queen along the Spanish
main, or troubled the waters of the blue
Pacific with his heel."
What the English and Dutch adven
turers went for, said Professor Bacon,
was gain. It was on this principle, he as
serted, the British Empire in India was
built up.' He briefly traced the history
of English progress in the Far East, and
came again to the white man's burden.
He continued:
This new doctrine has grown quietly but
steadily. It has permeated the whole tf the
English people, but it has only come to our
notice lately when we became more inter
ested In those things that have found a
philosopher In Benjamin Kidd and a poet
in Itudyard KiplltiK. It is known to us as
the "White Man's Burden.'' Little signifi
cance It would have had for us it there was
not opening out a powerful sentiment

the settlement of the question of the duty
of civilize.! nations toward the uncivilized.
The theory of the white man's burden
may briefly be stated as this: It is the busi
ness and the interest and the duty of the
white manâ that Is, the man of civilization,
to rule, to care for, to uplift, to enlighten
and to bring. If possible, into the light of
modern civilization the other man wherever
he is found; that It Is at once their interest
and their duty to do this, with violence,
with tact, with kindness, as each may be
necessary; to do It whether the other man
likes it or not; to do it at Infinite and im
measurable cost alike to the white man
and the other man. and, if possible, to lift
this lower, alien, colored race to something
like the plane of civilization which the most
advanced nations have reached. In the
meantime it !b the business of the civilized
races of the worldâ the most Civilized races
of the earthâ to police the whole planet and
make people behave themselves Just as it is
the business of the best and most civilized
people of a community to police that wh >le
community so that the elements that are
disorderly and uncivilized shall be com
pelled to behave themselves. It is a part of
this theory that It Is the duty of the civil
ized nations to put an end to the nameless
horrors of heathen savagery and heathen
civilization wherever they exist.
Now. one word about the application of
thlfi doctrine of oursâ and it's a very sad
subject, but it is a subject we have got to
discurs fairly and freely, and In which
every voice (jas got to be heard and every
honest man must have a right to express
his opinion, howover unpopular. Mr. I".!
--win Atkinson, with whom I differ greatly,
has got Just as much right, and Is* just as far
removed from any treasonable purposr- or
treasonable work or Influence as any other
man In this country. If the beginning of
our Imperial career Is going to be the sup
pression, either by law or by public
clamor, of absolutely free discussion of
every subject which can Involve the safety
and welfare of this nation, I say thÂ» be
ginning of our imperial career is goinp to be
marked with a blnckneps that will blast
us altosether.
In regard to the Philippinesâ for. of
course, the Philippines is the subject of
Which we speakâ riow did we get them? I
don't know. I didn't want them. I think
most of the intelligent men of this country
didn't want them, and as for the rest 'if
us. ns Mr. Dnuley expresses It. they don't
know the difference between the Philippines
and canned goods. Anil certainly if the
American people had any idea that the an
nexation of the Philippines would have r-jst
us one-half of what it baa already cfct i
us they never would have consented to it
If they had been consulted. Some people j
think that the annexation of the Philip
pines was providential. Perhaps the Lor.l
did It: perhaps the devil did it: perhaps
MrKinley did it. I don't know but I hi?
peet that all three hnd a hand in It, but I
do know that it's done and It can't be un
done.
The white man's burden In the. Philip- I
pines, Professor Bacon concluded, was j
' the day's work rut out for the people of
the United States.
"We have grit to do It patiently," he
said. "We have got to do it with perfect
consciousness of what it costs ami with
really no hope of reward except that of
our own consciences. But we are going
to do it."
Hon. John Barrett, ex-Minister to Siam,
was introduced as soon as the applause
at Professor Bacon's effort lad ceased.
Mr. Barrett told of his oflicial trawls in
the far East, especially in the Philip
i pines, and gave as his deduction from his
I observations that with proper men, not
politicians to educate the Filipino, he
would become a valuable acquisition to
the nation. On the score of morality In
the far East he said was not so cer- I
tain that the Asiatic might have a white
man's burden.

TWO GOOD STAKE RACES.
King's High -way Goes to Ben Eder,
the Sea Breeze to Alpen.
NEW YORK, Sept. 19.â Two stakes
were on tho card at â  esend to-dayâ
the King's Highway hurdle handicap and
the Sea Breeze. Only three horses ac
cepted thr- conditions In each. The hur
dle race generated into a farce*. Ben
Eder was at prohibitive odds and had a
practical walkover, is be won by about
half a milo. Merlin refused at every
Jump and bolted twice, but managed to
get over them all at last and finished
second, as Life Guard, the only other
starter, fell at the hurdle in front of the
grand stand. Toluca was an odds-on fa
vorite for the Sea Breeze stakes, with
Alpen second choice. AJpen took the track
at the fall of the flag and was never
headed, winning eased up by two lengths
from Hurricane. Results:

Florinell II came home a handy winner.
Barrier and Nokomo were ruled out of
the second race as outlaws, because they
have raced over outlawed tracks. Four
were left to start and Jack Bradley was
Installed as favorite. The last race was
a desperate one. King's Highway, Molo
and Tapan finished in a bunch after a
fierce drive and King's Highway won.

O'DONNELL
KNOCKED OUT
BY McCOY
Big Fellow Never Landed
a Good Blow, the Kid
Puzzling Him.
6l*clal Dlsoateh to The Call.
NEW YORK, Sept. 19.â Kid McCoy
had little difficulty in petting away
with Steve O'Donnell in the arena of
the Broadway Athletic Club to-night.
Despite O'Drnnell's advantage of
height, reach and weight McCoy went
to him gradually without taking any
careless liberties and soon had his big
adversary in trouble.
O'Donnell never landed a good blow
on McCoy, while the KM was gaining
ground In each succeeding round. His
left was always getting to the face,
head or wind and O'Donnell was
puzzled. He staggered frequently, and
in the sixth round went down from a
left swing. He remained down as long
as the rules allowed, but it was all u\>
with the big fellow. McCoy went after
him with swinging lefts and rights and
coon floored him with a hard left swing,
from the effects of which he was unable
to recover until counted out.
Steve had to be assisted to his feet
by the referee, while McCoy walked to
his corner smiling and without a mark.
The betting opened at 3 to 1 on Me
Coy, but these odds were increased to
10 to 1, with very few takers.
Every inch of the vast seating space
In the clulihouse was occupied half an
hour after the doors were opened and
hundreds of people thronged the streets
in front of the building early, crowding
in for standing room. Since the club
house was opened th<re has never been
such a large attendance. The men were
introduced to go twenty rounds at
catchweights and both received a
hearty reception.
Round Iâ They sparred at long range for
some moments. Steve tried two lefts for
the body, hut failed to land. McCoy sent
two lefts to the face and landed a light
left swing to the iaw. Then he sent a
similar blow to the chin without getting
anything back from the big fellow.
O'Donnell was entirely on the defensive
and Mif. >v amused the crowd by giving
State three hard backhand slaps on the
face with his lÂ«ft and put it in twice on
the nose lightly before th^ bell.
Roui,.! â _ McCoy led a light left for the
face and then tried a right swing, which
Bt( â  blocked. After some more spar
ring McCoy feinted with his left and
ihrt-w lils right over, but only landed on
the big fellow's should, r. U'Donnell, with
his advantage of reach ami height, was
unable to land on the Kid, who brought
tilt- blood from Steve's nose with a smart
left rap. McCoy was cautious and took
i.o chanced and held O'Donnell so safe
that Steve could not reach him.
Round ?,â One hundred to 20 was now
offered on McCoy without any takers.
The Kid opened with a light left to the
Deck and tried fur the body, but was
whort. They exchanged light lefts on the
he;id and McCoy shot his right to the
body. He followed quickly with a hard
swing on the jaw and O'Donnell stag
gered to the ropes. O'Donnell seemed ut
terly at a loss what to do, and McCoy
kept jabbing him with lefts on the face
and neck until the gong- interfered.
Round 4 â As usual, McCoy was on tho
aggressive and sent the left to the face.
Then he sent it to the body and failed
with Ills right for the wind. .Left and
right to the wind were McCoy's next con
tributions, after which Steve landed a
light left on the Kid's ear and a right
tan on the forehead. McCoy swung his
lelt to the jaw and jabbed another
straight on the mouth. Steve put a cou
ple of light lefts to the face, hut Mc-
Coy drove him to the ropes with a left
swing on the jaw and drove both hands
to the body in rapid succession, and
O'Donnell staggered to his corner.
Round 5â McCoy landed a left on the
jaw and then sent his left and right to
the body. Two left swings from the Kid
on the Jaw brought two rights from
O'Donnell, which touched up McCoy's
wild. ThÂ» Kid then forced matters, send
ing left and right swings to the Jaw, and
put O'Donnell on the ropes, where Steve
clinched. The Kid in the breakaway
swung his left to the jaw lightly. They
came to the center of the ring only to bo
separated by the gong.
Round 6â McCoy opened with left and
right swings to the Jaw; then he stag
gered Steve to the ropes with a left on the
jaw. Two left Jabs to the body made
O'Donnell stagger. He came to the center
and the Kid sent him reeling and kept
slamming Steve around the ring with lefts
and rights. O'Donnell went down from r
left swing and took the limit to get up.
McCoy rushed at him as soon as he arose
and landed on him at will. A jab in the
stomach brought O'Donnell down to Me-
I'ny's height and then the Kid sailed in
with lefts and rights on the jaw. O'Don
nell was bleeding profusely from the nose
and mouth and was groggy. McCoy
finally put him down with a left swing
on the jaw and O'Donnell was counted
out. Time of round, 2 minutes 4S seconds.
After the men had returned to their
dressing-rooms McCoy said:
"I will post $1000 to-morrow to meet
i Bob F^zsimmons for the title of mid-
I die-weight champion of the world at
168 pounds. My money will remain up
for thirty days, and should Fitzslm
mons ignore my defl I will claim the
title aiid withdraw my money, after
which I will challenge Fitzsimmons at
catchweights. This ought to make him
come to time If he Intends fighting any
one. If he fails to defend the middle
weight championship, and I claim It, I
will defend it against all comers â
n'Kroes barred â at 158 pounds."
Billy Needham, late of St. Paul, and
Jim McKeever of Philadelphia sparred
a ten-round draw before the big bout.

BILLY REED COACHES
A TEAM AT STANFORD
Babe Burnett Will Be Beady for
Work in a Very Few
Days.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Sept. IS.â
Billy Reed, fullbark of Harvard's victor
ious team, appeared on tlv- football field to
night and took his position behind the line
for the edification of Stanford's gridiron
candidates. He went through the usual
practice movements with the team and
gave them the benefit of some of h!.Â« Har
vard experience. A? Reed left the field he
heartllv shook the hand of Chamberlin,
the man who gave him so much trouble
on th.' Vale line last Thanksgiving day.
Reed, who is 'me of America's foremost
ftthletes and captains, leaves his Relmont
home to-morrow for Harvard, where he
will *fo into active training for this fall's
campaign.
Treasurer Leiter to-night received word
from Babe Burnett that he would be on
the campus Friday, ready for work. This
means the stiffening of Stanford's center
trio, and may prove to be the deciding
feature of the game.

OUTLOOK IS
BRIGHT FOR
FINE RACING
Horses, Jockeys and Bookies
in Plenty for the Open
ing on Saturday.
The California racing season of IR!>9 and
extending- well into the year 1900 will en
joy a renewal at Oakland track on Satur
day, September 23. The crack jockeys of
the country will not be seen in the pigskin
on the opening day, nor will all of the best
handicap horses of the day face the bar
-1 Her. But by the foregoing statement it
must not be construed that there will be
no competent pilots or cood horses to
place wagers on. Every incoming train
from the East brings a fresh supply of
equine talent, the very latest to date be
ing the stable of P. Ryan, one of the most
consistent that ever ran here. Mr. Ryan's
string arrived at Oakland on Sunday, and
comprises the following very useful per
formers: Synia, Summer, Jerid, Marcato,
Silver Tone, Cyril, Afamada. Kacivah and
a yearling by Fonso. Besides there will
be represented locally Burns & Water
house with an immense stable of bread
winners, including their two St. Louis
purchases, Bit of Fashion and Southern
Girl, J. G. Brown, out of IJbertlne, Bam
boulia, Monrovia, Diomed and a dozen
others; the lighter strings of "Curley"
Shields, McMahon & Gerhardy, John
Humphrey, Tom Boyle, Caesar Young,
Dun Honig, S. F. Capps, McHugh & Lin
nell, "Hanger" Jones, Dagjjie Smith and
a host of others.
The jockeys, for the greater part, are
not above mediocrity, including among
them Quill Morse, Eddie Joins,
Macklin, Frank Lmffy Tommy But
ler, Johnny Sullivan and Ruiz, but
they are all capable of doing good
work in the saddle. Buchanan is an
extremely promising lad, and if Atkins &
Lottridge can persuade "Monk" Coburn
to wear an ice cap every other day he
too can win an occasional race. Of course,
Charley Thorpe, the Western favorite,
will be on hand, and praise in this in
stance Is unnecessary. His past record
speaks for itself.
To start off with the bookmaking brig
ade will be limited, though at present it
looks as if the ensemble would be some
thing like John Humphrey, Schwartz &
Co., Harlan & Co., Hoffman te Co., Paul
Ridley, Phil Archibald, Otis Evans and
Johnny Lyons. The latter was here last
winter, but did not book. He has a bank
roll large enough to derail a Southern Pa
cific train and will give the chalk and
chamois a hard "go. The firms men
tioned are almost certainties, and there
will perhaps be a dozen or more In all lay
ing prices.
An evening paper which has been decry
ing the wicked horrors of a racetrack
war with all the attendant atrocities of
the naughty ungovernable turf advisers
recently printed the following significant
paragraph: "Mr. Corrigan finished bis
Beason at Chicago Saturday. He will be
here directly and then there will be war
in earnest." If t lie writer had said "the
Beason finished Mr. Corrigan at Saratoga
and he had retired to Hawthorne, in
which track he owns |40,000 worth of
stock, to prepare for another sortie," then
he would have hit the nail on the head.
Corrigan will probably hold a grand pow
wow of all the medicine men at Haw
thorne Lodge, signal tires for miles around
will illuminate the heavens, weird ghost
dances will end the wild orgies and we
may expect to see the grand old chief of
Cicero Township appeur here bedaubed
â¢with war paint and bedecked with feath
ers as we never paw him before.
Golden Rule, greatest of the bad lot of
two-year-olds racing at Ingleside and
Oakland last spring, a cheap plater at
Saratoga, has finally found his levfl. He
can win at Hawthorne, make Time turn
a ghastly hue, and now his friends again
say he Is a great colt. Even Corngan
found a Chicago reporter the other day
who believed it and printed such stuff in
the paper ho represented, imn't those peo
ple know that a good selling plater can
run rings around a trashy bunch of plat
ers and almost hang up a record? But
put this same horpp in with some handi
cap horses-, and his name is utterly for
got at the finish. The pnor fellow is car
ried so fast the first part of the journey
that he "cracks" and asks the others to
'.'break the news to mother."
Zeke Abrahams, one- well known as an
Impresario in the pugilistic zone, is now
looking for soft money at the country
fairs. Zeke had the betting privilege at
Eureka, wherp ho taught the rural visit
ors the intricacies of the percentage sys
tem. Ho leaves to-night for Boise, Idaho,
where he will also manage the ring.

that Willie lingered behind to "try and fix
matters up." If Martin emerges from
this last gala with spinnaker and gaff

for Patsy MeDermott to win the Arctic

SHAMROCK'S GAFF BREAKS DURING A TRIAL SPIN.
THK tuning-up of the yacht Shamrock, challenger for the America cup,
preparatory to the first of the series of races on October 3, has given
Sir Thomas Upton and his associates some anxious moments. The most
serious accident tending to delay the preparation of the yacht occurred
last Wednesday. The metal pan! which supports the mainsail collapsed when
there was comparatively little pressure on it. It was not the extent of the
accident, but the possibilities it opened up that gave the visiting yachts
men their shock. If this metal spar lie so weak as to bend like a piece of
lead pipe, then all the spars are defective and may collapse at a critical mo
ment. The broken gaff was at once replaced by one of those kept In reserve.
William Fife. th._- designer, 1p said to have recommended the metal spars
against the advice of Thornycroft. one of the most celebrated of England's
naval architects.
SHAMROCK
DID NOT MAKE
FAST TIME
Experts, After the Trial Spin,
Say the Columbia Will
Win the Race.
Fpeclal Dispatch to The CSa.ll.
NEW YORK. Sept. 19.â Winds of vary
ing strength marked to-day's trial spin
of the Shamrock. From seven knots an
hour at first It blew fully twelve knots
toward the finish. Whenever a strong
puff struck the challenger she moved off,
full of life. Taking the day as It turned
out, experts were unanimous in saying
that the Defender, If she had been with
the green cutter, would have passed
through the ordeal satisfactorily, and
that the Columbia, had she been there,
would have been "bellwether" from start
to finish.
Sir Thomas Upton and his associates
decided to send the yacht to windward
on the first leg of the course selected, but
the shifting of the wind shortly after the
start prevented that. The second and
final less of reaching, however, were all
that they could have desired.
As the wind was south by east, the tug
Lawrence was sent ten miles from the
Scotland lightship, but the breeze backed
to the south, so that the weather mark
was made in three boards, the second be
ing of long duration. The second leg was
to Bandy Hook lightship, about eleven
nautical miles, and the third was back to
the Scotland lightship, four and an eighth
nautical miles. The second leg was a
broad reach, and the last also, with the
wind abaft the beam. It required 1 hour
38 minutes and 20 seconds to cover the
first leg. 1 hour 32 minutes and 40 seconds
for the second leg. and 23 minutes for the
last. This was by outside timing. By the
official timer on the Erin the legs "were
made in this wise:
First, 1 hour 37 minutes 33 seconds;
second, 1 hour S3 minutes 37 seconds;
third, 23 minutes 18 seconds.
The whole distance of twenty-five and
an eighth miles was sailed In 3 hours 4
minutes and 15 seconds, unofficial timing,
or 3 hours 4 minutes and 28 seconds by
the Erin's figures.
The crews of the Shamrock were at
times shifted from abaft the mainmast
to the stern and back again. Mr. Fife or
Skipper Hogarth trying experiments with
their weight. The boat, however, made
slow progress, as in 32 minutes from the
time of starting she had gone only about
three and a half nautical miles.
WANTED TO KILL A
MURDERER'S FRIEND
CHINESE WITH A BIG GTJN IN
JAIL.
Ah Fong, Who Was Shot at by Wong
Hing, the Captured Criminal,
Looks for Trouble.
Wong Hlng, the San Jose murderer, who
was captured at Fresno last Sunday, will
be brought to this city by Officer Rey
nolds to-day. Yesterday Ah Fong
was made a target for the captured man's
bullets on September 13 on Spofford alley
In this city, was arrested by Sergeant
Duke and posse while he was looking for
one of Hing's friends with a 44-caliber re
volver, which he concealed under his
coat. His name was entered on the small
book at the Central police station and ho
will be held as a witness in the trial of
Wong Hing before any charge is placed
against him.
The arrest yesterday was only one of a
series of events which have hat'i
since a slave girl was spirited from a
house on Jackson street and taken to
San Jose. Some trouble arose over her
possession, and L<ee OngPoon was mur
dered and Deputy Sheriff Mackey of San
Jose shot and in"jTirecl by Wong Hing.
On September 13 the deputy sheriff whr*
was shot brought two Chinamen. Ah,
Fong and Ah Yum. to this city to assist
him in capturing the criminal. While th<i
two Chinamen were passing along Spof
ford alley on that <lay they were sighted,
by Hing, who fired three shots at Ah
Fong and again escaped. One of the
leaden missiles passed through the trous
ers of Ah Yum and narrowly missed kill
ing a Chinese laborer in a store opposite.
Tling was taken after a desperate strug
gle in Fresno on Sunday.
Yesterday afternoon Sergeant Duke dis-.
oovered Ah Fong passing along Waverli â¢y
place, and he noted that the Chlaaman'a
actions were suspicious. He at once took,
him into custody, and whon he searched
him found a large 44-caliber revolver on
bis person. He had his hand on the
weapon when ho was taken, and It was
his Intention to shoot one of Hing's
friends on sight. The pnliee say that the
trio of Chinamen implicated in thr shoor
ing are all wicked men. and do not think
that the trouble will end with yesterday's
arrest. The affair has been in'the nature
of a highbinder's war and has caused
much commotion in the Chinese quarters
of both San Jose and Snn Francisco.

MORE SMALLPOX
IN LUCKLESS
THIRTY-FIRST
Two More Cases Sent
Away.
Two more men of the luckless Thirty
first Regiment have been sent out to the
smallpox hospital at the Presidio to joir
the man already there. One of them was
sent from among the men who have beer
held in detention since the first cast- brok(
out, and the other was taken sick \vhil<
on his way over to Angel Island. ,
The regiment itself has been sent ovei
to the big detention camp on Angel Isl
and. and there it will stay for a week 01
more, or until all possible cases have hat
an opportunity to develop. It was whil<
the McDowell was taking over the firs
section of the regiment that one of th<
men showed symptoms of smallpox. How
he had been overlooked by the surgeons
of the regiment is a mystery, but whil<
.on his way over he was found to be in
fected and he was sent back at once. Th<
McDowell was sent Into quarantine her
self as a result, and her crew will have tc
remain over at the island for a wee&
an>\\ay, while the vessel herself will have
to be fumigated.
There will be established a camp of de
tention out r.ear where the smallpox hos
' puai is located, and hereafter every sus
. pected case must go out there to await
: the development of his symptoms. There
are now eleven suspects ana three pa
tients. One of the new patients is Wil
liam Tom'oauerhâ the one who went from
the McDowell is not known. Both are
from Company M.
As soon as the Thirty-first was out ol
its camp a s^uad of men under the direc
tion of Colonel Greenleaf, inspecting sur
geon, went at the work of disinfecting
tne place and preparing it for the accom
modation of tne Thirty-third Regiment,
which was already in from Texas and
awaiting a cnance to establish Itself in
the I'resicuo. 'Itn or twelve tents were
burned with the i iors, and all the prop
erty ;uat was In tnem was destroyed. The
gii.uv.a all around the tents where White
was quartered v. .is sprinkled with lime
arid alt the ground near the tents burned
â¢was similarly treated. Then the Thirty
third Regiment was allowed to come in.
There is no danger of infection to the
1 liirty-third, according to the surgeons,
for they say ample means to disinfect the
camp have been taken.
The quarantining of the Thirty-first
Regiment may mean a change of orders
fur the Twenty-seventh or the Thirtieth
The Twenty-seventh Is under orders to
leave on the Tacoma and the Elder, the
first scheduled to sail yesterday. It may
be that the regiment will be sent on the
t*rant instead, or the Thirtieth, under
uriiers to sail on the Sherman on the 21st
inst., may leave on the Grant, leaving the
Sherman to be taken later by the Thirty
tirst. The Thirty-second will arrive from
Fort Leavenworth; Kans., to-morrow, un
less df-layed, and something must be done
to make room. If the transports leave on
time there will not be much trouble, but
if they are delayed by the strike there will
te a blockade of troops here until more
room can be made for them.
The camps of the volunteers being mus
tered ou; might be used, but there will
not be much room there until after mis
week. A.s it is now, the camps are full.
but the California men will be mustered
out to-morrow, leaving room for a three
battalion regiment. Before that time,
however, the Zraiandia and the Valencia
v. 11l pronably be in with the three bat
talions of the Montana Regiment, and the
camp will again be full until Saturday,
when the two battalions of the Idaho
K< and the Wyoming battalion will
be mustered out. That will leave room
for a full regiment, until the end of the
month anyway.
There have been promotions in the new
ly arrived Twenty-sixth Regiment owing
to the vacancy caused by the appointment
of Lieutenant Colonel Duvall to be colonel
of one of the still newer regiments. Ma
jor Joseph T. Dickman has been made
lieutenant colonel. Captain Guy V. Henry

mands, but there was no room lor him as

sixth, so he went along as sergi ar.'. major.
Hi. has been given the first chance for a
commission that has appeared in the regi
ment.
The promotions in the Twenty-sixth
were made strictly acording to the mili
tary rule. The senior major was made
lieutenant colonel, the senior captain was
made major, the senior first lieutenant
was given the next opening and the senior
second lieutenant wa.s aJso put ahead. It
has been different with the troops that
have come home from Manila, In their
case the promotions have been by com
panies, in the old National Guard fashion.
\\ nen a captain of a company has been
put up, his two lieutenants have followed
aim. and a sergeant from his own com
pany has stepped into the vacancy formed
among the commissions. In the case of
the California Regiment, the senior first
sergeant. Henry T. Hicks, was made ser
geant major in place of Percy 1.. Badt,
â who was given a commission, and there
he has remained. In the meantime there
have been vacancies in several companies
but the resulting promotions have always
been to the officers in the same company,
and the new officers have been drawn
from among the non-commissioned offi
cers of the same company. The officers
and non-commissioned officers on the staff
have remained as they were. Hicks has
seen seven years' service in the National
Guard, during most of which time he has

COLONEL MILEY
DIES AT MANILA
THE sad news nf the death of Colonel John D. Miley, inspector general
of volunteers, in Manila was received in this city yesterday by General
Shafter. whom he formerly served as aid-de-camp. His death occasioned
genuine sorrow among his former comrades in this city, and many ex
pressions of repret were heard at General Shafter's headquarters at the loss
of a thorough gentl< man and a brave soldier.
Colonel Miley leaves a widow and four children, who are at present living
with her father,' Colonel Mordecai, at Benlcia Barracks. His brother married
a daughter of A. B. Butler of Fresno. Many messages of condolence have
been forwarded to the bereaved family.
lieutenant Colonel Miley was ,a native of Illinois, and was graduated
from West Point in 1887. In 1890 he came to this city with the Fifth Artillery.
During his â  - at the Presidio few officers were as popular with the
rank and file as he. and a host of friends attest his popularity.
When war broke oul with Spain, as Major Miley he went to Cuba as an
aid on General Shafter's staff, and he. together with Captain W. H. McKit
trick and Lieutenant J. S. Wheeler, raised the American flag at Santiago. His
conduct in that campaign won for him promotion to a lieutenant colonelcy.
He was a conspicuous figure on the firing line and was at all times fearless
in danger.
Last February <"nlonel Miley was ordered to the Philippines and was ap
pointed inspector general of volunteers nn General Otis' staff. He served In
that capacity until he was made Collector of Customs at Manila and tfivon
sup< rvision of the entire customs service in the Philippines. It was on the
6th inst. that the dread disease attacked him. and death yesterday cut short
a promising career. Colonel Miley's fank in the regular army was first lieu
tenant of the Second Artillery.
When the intelligence reached the city that Colonel Miley was prostrated
by fever General Shafter wired General (His. requesting a daily cable mes
sage, reporting the condition of the patient: and every day thereafter a
message was wired to headquarters of the department. About a. week ago
the physician's diagnosis of the case was cabled from Manila, and medical
men here were then convinced that the patient could not recover. Mrs.
Miley, a soldier? daughter and a soldier's wife, bore up bravely under the
shock caused by the cablegram announcing her husband's death.
If Colonel Miley's life had been spared he would have acquired high
rank and great distinction in the army. He was a soldier of many ac
complishments, dauntless on the field of battle and progressive In the ad
ministration of military affairs in time of peace. His capacity for work
was marvelous and his industry remarkable. Generals Shafter and Gra
ham had the utmost confidence in his judgment.
Colonel Miley was familiar with the high power guns and the dynamite
battery defending the harbor. He gained by study and daily observation a
practical knowledge of the method employed in handling dynamite projec
tiles and applying compressed air.
Before he left San Francisco to engage in the Cuban campaign he ma
terially increased The insurance on his life for the benefit of his family.
He was an affectionate, home loving man.Jiut when the call of duty came
he was ready and resolute.
be held at the Presidio of San Francisco
until further notification from headquar
ters tivat the ship is ready.
This detachment will come near to
cleaning out the recruit camp. Assigned
recruits are men recruited for service
with any command who have been de
tailed to" Mil vacancies in the regiments
â  v |n thÂ« Islands. They are assigned
by their commanding officer in accord
ance with Instructions fn.m Washington.
The remaining recruits, after the as
signments. ar>- srill casuals, and all of
these at the Presidio are being sent over
to the officers of the Fortieth Infantry,
who are now trying to form a battalion
of that regiment at the post. So far they
have succeeded In securing about Beventy
of the 400 and odd men needed. Recruits
are not coming in so fast as they were
two months ago.
Second Lieutenant William S. Sinclair
of the Fourteenth Infantry has been as
signed to temporary duty with the re
cruits at the Presidio, pending his as
signment to Manila.
Major George W. Flshback and Major
George E. Pickett, additional paymasters
of volunteers, have been assigned to duty
with the chief paymaster of this depart
ment.
Sergeant Charles A. Smith. Battery A,
Sixth Artillery, has been order. 'l to ap
pear before an examining board to be
examined for a commission In the regu
lar army. Sergeant Smith is now sta
tion.-d at Camp McKlnley, Hawaiian isl
ands.
Roy Johnston, the recruit who poured
out his woes in a letter to the President,
has been acquitted by a court-martial for
his offense. He wrote to the President,
asking f<r his discharge, and criticizing
his officers very severely. It was shown
at the court-martial that at the time he
wrote the letter he did not know an of
ficer when he saw one in uniform, and
as he begged to be let off he was ac
quitted. Ii Is an offense against army
regulations for a private to address the
President without sending his letter
through his commanding officer. This
was not considered so much of an of
fense in the case of Johnston as what
he wrote. He denounced his officers and
cast slurs upon his comrades, and so the
matter was taken up. .
For sleeping on post Private Doll T.
Long of the Thirty-first Infantry has
been sentenced to seven days' confine
ment and to forfeit $11 of his pay.
Burt Snelson. who enlisted under the
name of Edward Robinson, a discharged
soldier died at the general hospital yes

Manila already discharged, and it is not
known what command he belonged to.
He died of consumption.

THE SAN FBANOISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 20. 1899.
IS NOW A CAPTAIN
IN SIGNAL CORPS
CAPTAIN CHARLES H. GORDON.
ANNOUNCEMENT was made in the
telegraphic dispatches from Wash
ington D. <"., last Monday that First
Lieutenant Charles 11. Gordon has
been promoted to the rank of captain.
The officer who has been thus honored
is now on his way to this city on the
transport City of Para which will arrive
shortly. Ills promotion Is the direct
result of gallant service with the Signal
i 'Mips, of which ho was a member, during
several fierce engagements.
Lieutenant Gordon left this city on the
port City of Rio do Janeiro with the
Eighteenth Company, I'nited States sig
nal Corps, and on arriving In the Philip
pines was placed in charge of the Tondo
district On the night that Manila was
taken, Lieutenant Gordon was assigned
to General Mac Arthur's division as signal
r.ftlcer. He was the first to establish
:ommunication with the American fleet
in that eventful night.
He continued to serve with General
MaeArthur during the latter's advance
!nto Caloocan and the Interior. He wa.s
me of five men who were mentioned by
:heir commanding officer for conspicuous
:ind distinguished services during those
trying times. He was subsequently as
signed to General Lawton's command
md though not a member of General H
;. Otis' brigade, was highly regarded by
:hat officer, whose acquaintance he made
jn the trip to the Philippines.
The new captain was born In Maryland
md was educated in Poughkeepsie, N. Y.
t-Ie is the son of Colonel D. S. Gordon
J. S. A., retired, and a brother of Philip
3ordon. ticket agent of the Southern
Pacific Company in this city. Captain
3ordon Is 36 years of age and was at one
ime agent of the Southern Pacific at
Draey. He subsequently resigned to go
nto the mining business, which he left
o enlist in the service of his country.
A'hen he arrives here with his company
t will be for the purpose of being
nustered out, and he will then join his
anjily at the residence, 1707 Scott street.
STRIKE ON THE
TRANSPORTS IS
STILL GOING ON
Boilermakers Will Not
Give In.
Everything is in statu quo on the Gov
ernment wharf. There is no work being
done by the boiler makers on the Sher
man, and there may be trouble to-day
when a call for men to work on the Gle
nogle is made. There was only a few
hours' work required on the Tacoma to
get her ready for sea and this was done
by the men. bo the Tacoma and George
W. Elder will sail for Manila to-day.
They will take a regiment between them,
and Captain Barneson expects to get
them away by 4 p. m.
Tbe boiler makers Intend to stick out
for their demands and the contractors
have decided not to yield. In the event
of the Government being unable to get
the repairs made here it may send the
transports 10 Manila under a reduced
steam pressure and then have the ves
sels overhauled at Hongkong on the way
back to San Francisco. Should Uncle
Sam be forced to take that course, then
all the repairs to the transports wouid
be done at the same lime and there would
be a loss of at least $10,tX>0 a week in
wages alone to rian Francisco.
The painters made no move yesterday.
Some of them are gelling $;â ! 50, some t'i
and the majority iZ 50 for an eight-hour
day. For overtime they get double pay.
Thus a painter goes to work at S a. m.
and lays oIT at noun for lunch. Begin
ning again at 1 p. m., he works to 5 p. m.
and lays off an hour for supper. Then
from ti to 10 p. m. he works overtime
and for the twelve hours' work gets two
days' pay. The men are to have, a con
ference with Captain Bennett to-day, but
he does not anticipate any trouble. The
payroll of the painters <>n the transports
last week was over $6000.
There are live large steamers on the
way here, all of which will be taken by
the Government as transports. The West
minster is six uays uui jrom Newcastle,
N S. W., with a cargo of coal, and the
Anglo Australian ana Port Stephens are
expected to leave the same port any day
now. The Pak Ling and Moyune are now
In Chinese waters and will come here
via Nagasaki. The Westminster is Zolu
tuns net, the Anglo Australian 2561 tons
net the Port Stephens 127* tons net, the
Pak Ling &575 tons net and the Moyune
aulo tons net burden. Each or them win
merefore easily carry a regiment of soi
aiers and all will make splendid trans
ports. With these vessels aaued to the
fleet aiready engaged Uncle Sam will
nave no diiuculty in rustling a big body
of men to the Piiillpinet,, and it now be
gins to look as thougn the reoellion wouid
oe put down In the time specified by the
administration.
The hospuai ship Relief was passed by
the boara ol survej yesterday. Sne win
go into the fctream to-morrow, and as
soon as her compasses have been adjusted
will start for Manila. Honolulu will be
her rust port of can. After coaling mere
she will proceed to Guam and ttien to Ma
nila. On arriving there she will be turned
into a permanent hospital, occasionally
nmking short cruises lor the beneiit of
the invalids on board.
The members of the board who passed
upon the seaworthiness of the Relief
were: commander H. G. O. Colby, L". S.
N.; Captain John Bermingham, Lnited
States Supervising Inspector of Steam
Vessels; Kooert torsyth, chief engineer,
I'nion Iron Works; James Dickey, super
intendent shipyards, Union Iron Works,
Captain John Barneson, marine superin
tendent, United States army transport
service. Captain Frank Greene, signal
corps, U. 8. A., is detailed as recorder of
the board.
Onp of the hospital stewards who wa?
to have gone to Manila on the Relief had
his voyage stopped yesterday. Had the
vessel gone out on time he- would have
had a respite, but now he is in prison witn
a rha'ge of desertion hanging over him.
His name is Stephen C. Livingstone, and
lie was with tho army in Cjba. 1!<- did
not like the life and deserted. After a
time the longing for a soldier's life came,
over him again and ho rv-enlistfd in the
hospital corps. While on tht P.elief he
whs recognized by one of his- former offi
cers and the fact was telegraphed to
Washington. A telegram came back or
dering his arrest, and yesterday Living
stone was placed -n irons and taken out
to the Presidio. He will be tried by court
martial and will be lucky if he gets of*
with three years on Alcnt^z.
The transports Sikh and Â»{lo do Janeiro
are going to Portland as soon as they are
fitted out. They will take on board there
the Thirty-fifth Regiment and proceed to
Manila. The vessels were to have loft
here next Friday, but. it will probabiy be
next week before they get away, as the.
mattress company cannot turn the Turner
patent bunk with which they are to be
equipped out in time.
Chief Engineer George Klngsland of the
transport Sherman is proud of his staff of
assistants. The oldest only i olebrated his
twenty-seventh birthday last month; nev
ertheless they make up ns efficient a body
of mechanics as there is In the transport
service. Mr. Kingslands first assistant is
R. MeCabe; second assistants, O. Hiekey
and Q. Berry; third asistants, C. McDon
ald. C. Molntyre and S. Crisp.
The transport St. Paul, which loaded
cavalry and horses at Seattle for the Phil
ippines, reached Knbf last Monday. She
will probabiy remain there a few" days,
and should got to Manila about the end
of the month.
The quartermaster's steamer General
McDowell was placed in quarantine yos
t.rday. While conveying a company of
the Thirty-first Regiment to the deten
tion camp on Angel Island a rasÂ» of
smallpox broke out among the soldiers.
When the fact became known the entire
regiment was sent to the camp on the.
Steamer Captain Weber, and the Mc-
Dowell was placed in quarantine. She
was thoroughly fumignted and released,
but the crew will have to remain in quar
aintine for fourteen days. In the mean
time the quarantine steamer Sternberg is
making the McDowell's runs to the army
posts.
It now looks as though the Thirty-first
Regiment would not get away for a fort
night. In that event another body of men
will leave on the transport Grant, as that
vessel is in the stream all ready to sail.
INCREASE OF CRIME
AMONG SOLDIERS
GENERAL SHAFTER ASKED TO
PROVIDE A PROVOST GUARD.
The numerous oases of soldiers called in
the Police Courts recently charged with
various crimes have called forth a re
monstrance from the Judges, and yester
day Judge Graham sent the following
letter to General Shafter:
As one of the Judges of the Police
Court of this city and county, the
numerous depredations committed in
this city by the recruits have been
brought forcibly to my notice. Nearly
f-very morning m^n in uniform are
brought into the Police Courts charged
with all crimes from drunkenness to
murder. I notice that nearly all the
crinu-s committed by the soldiers are
committed while they are under the
influence of liquor and late at night.
It has been suggested to me by officers
that if a provost guard were estab
lished downtown to "round up" and
take charge of obstreperous, vicious or
intoxicated soldiers it would result in
advantage both to the citizens and to
the soldiers themselves.
Yesterday William Brown of the Thirty
sixth Infantry appeared before Judge
Graham to answer a charge of begging.
He was arrested on Sixteenth street, be
tween Mission and Howard, on Monday
night while soliciting alms from pedes
trians. Lieutenant Peck of his company
told the Judge that the regiment was to
leave by the transport Grant for Manila
in about ten days, and the- Judge ordered
U. S. N-
TABLES TURNED
ON A PORTLAND
SHIP'S RUNNER
Was Carried to Sea
Against His Will.
The British ship Muskoka. which sailed
for Europe from Astoria a couple of days
ago, had considerable trouble in securing
a crew. The boarding masters on the
Columbia River wanted $80 a man, so the
captain employed Frank Turk and J.
Lynch to get him twenty-two sailors.
Turk came to San Francisco and secured
sixteen men whom he shipped north on
the steamer Columbia. He could get no
more sailors here, so he wired Lynch to
go to Puget Sound and pick up six A B's
there. Lynch went to Seattle and there
found the American ship Rufus E. Wood,
ready to sail for Sydney, N. S. W. He
went aboard and tried to get six of the
crew to desert, but while he was
persuading the men the tug came along
side and took the ship to sea. Lynch is
now on his way to Australia, and the
captain of the Wood may be depended
upon to see that he works his passage,
tailing to get any more men the Muskoka
put to sea short handed.
The Mail steamer Colon arrived from
Panama and way ports yesterday with
fifteen cabin passengers and eighteen
Chinese in transit for Hongkong. Among
her cargo was over $iuo ,<JUU worth of
ir>asure. in Central American silver
there was J15.554; three bars of gold and
silver were valued at JZS.iNiO, fifty-live bars
of silver at $42 .uw. thirty-six sacks of
precipitate of silver at $20,uu0 and one
case of gold dust on which no value was
placed.
The steiimer America Maru was more
damaged Sy the lire that broke out
in her coal bunkers than was at first an
ticipated. While in Yokohama the coal
caught tire, but was put out, and on
September lv she sailed for San Fran
cisco via Honolulu. A few days later she
put back, the coal in her hunkers having
caught tire again. A dispatch to the
Merchants' Exchange yesterday stated
that the fire had been put out, but the
cargo i nthe main hold was "very much
damaged." It will now probably be the
first week in October before the America
Maru gets here.
P. Kilcoyne, one of the Market-street
Railroad Company's employes, was badly
injured on Kearny street yesterday. He
was helping to repair the railroad track
and got crushed betwee two railroad ties.
His right leg was badly lacerated and
his lelt leg broken. He was treated at
the Harbor Receiving Hospital by Dr.
Robinson and was afterward removed to
the railroad hospital.
Xels Hanson, a sailor on the ship Ori
ental, fell into the hold of the vessel
yesterday. At the Harbor Hospital Dr.
Robinson found that both his wrists were
sprained and his face badly lacerated.
Five stitches had to be taken in his eye
brow before he could leave the operating
table.
Andrew Olsen had a row with his land
lord at 43 Steuart street last Monday night
and yesterday had a lacerated scalp
sewed up at the Harbor Hospital. An
drew asked the landlord for a candle with
which to light his way to bed and instead
was struck over the head with a club, so
he says.
Captain Thompson Colly has turned
marine artist since leaving the sea for a
life ashore, and some of his efforts in the
painter's art are very good. He has made
a particularly good picture of the San
Francisco owned ship Sintram, which he
is going to send to his friend. Captain
Matthews, in New Zealand. Painting is
now Captain Colly's hobby, and although
he has taken it up late in life he is raak
ing rapid progress.
that Brown be detained in the City Prison
till the regiment should sail.
Corporal John Harris of Company E,
Twenty-sixth Infantry, was before Judge
Mogan on a charge of disturbing the
peace. He and three other soldiers were
creating a disturbance at Market and
Fifth streets late Monday night by fight
ing among themselves and using the most
profane and vulgar language. Policeman
Tillman cautioned them to keep quiet,
but they would not, and Harris got a
brick and threw it at the officer. Till
man placed him under aVrest, but he
fniight so hard that the officer had to use
his club to bring him under subjection.
The Judge convicted Harris yesterday
morning and will sentence him to-day.
"Complaints have recently been made
to me, said the Judge, "about men in
uniform insulting ladles on the streets,
and it. is time that something was done to
put a stop to such conduct. The com
plaints have beer, about men who are con
nected with the casual detachments, who
seem to be undor the impression that they
can get drunk and run the city because
they wear a uniform. Men who have seen
Bervice are imbued with more gentlemanly
instincts and will not insult women, and
the first one of these casuals brought be
fore me on such a charge will be made an
example of."
Harris claims that he is an old soldier,
having seen twelve years' service, and
he and his three friends were only having
n good time when the officer arrested
him.
VOLUNTEERS BANQUETED.
A banquet and reception was tendered
Monday night by St. Anthony's Sodality
of St. Boniface Church to some of the
members of the First California Volun
teers, who were also members of the par
â  ish. The hall of the sodality had been
! handsomely decorated and an appropriate
programme was arranged. Toasts were
delivered by members of the clergy and
several of the participants. Undoubtedly
it v..is the- most successful affair ever
given in the parish, and will always be
renumbered by those present.

THE TAX LEVY.
IT is vhetiier the annals ot san rranciscu
furnish a more appalling instance of dirt.v politics
than was supplied by the morning
: Democracy yesterday. In attempt
itical capital out of the re-arranged
tax levy, passed by the Supervisors on Monday, that
sheet descended to a level of moral degradation com
pared with which the an- of the ordinary ward poli
lity of exalted statesmanship.
Fherchave been in this city many conspicuous ex
of political wallowing in the pursuit of office,
which might be cited numerous assaults upon
private character designed to break down the aspira
if worthy men willing to serve the public; but
the oldest inhabitant, we venture to say, will fail to
recall an instance where a new-paper, for the purpose
of securing a petty political advantage of doubtful
value, lias deliberately misrepresented the facts of a
ux levy and with devilish malignity falsified its fig
ures. Nor is there in our whole history a case in
which there has been so successful an imitation oi
Satan's methods. We doubt whether the devil, mas
i the livery of heaven, would have been
equal to the task of enacting such a part in the in
terest of "f rnmeni "
In order to demonstrate the contemptible character
of the Examiner's assault upon the Supervisors in
connection with the tax levy it is only necessary to
appeal to the aci '>n Monday morning that sheet
printed ti in which it quoted the changes mi
the provisional levy suggested by Mayor Phelan.
The appropriations agreed upon in this levy by the
Supervisors "ii August 7 amou $2,520.18(3.
Mayor Phelan made changes last week, footing up
;, among which were extra allow*
$71,080 for the School Depart
ment, $31,296 !<>r the Street Department,
and $25,000 for the Fire Department. In order to
bring the levy within the pledged rate of $1 upon a
total valuation of $.^50,000,000 the Mayor placed
amounts agcregatins $-Ml.too â required for defi
ciencies, judgments, election expenses and the inter
est and funds â outside the pledge, thus rec
ognizing and indorsing the principle that expendi
irres not current might be met in that way.
Not only did the Examiner interview the Mayor
and approve I 1 '- proposed changes, but it pointed
proudly to the fact that the rate had been fixed at
0Q.5 cents by that official. The Supervisors were, in
the same article, dared to alter the figures, although
between the lines there was expressed no uncertain
hope that they .vould do so, and thereby manufacture
political capital for the Democratic party.
But the Supervisors did not alter the figures. On
the contrary, they adopted them bodily. To the list
of exemption-, however, they added $i_>s,ooo for the
acquisition for park purposes of the lands bounded
by Dupont, California and Pine street- and St. Mary's
place. To this appropriation every man of them had
been pledged, including the two Democrats and the
two RÂ«publicans who voted against it. This money
i> not necessary for current expenses. It comes
fairly within the principle ixcmption set up
by Mayor Phelan and indorsed In the F.xamincr in
the case of deficiencies, judgments, election expenses
i<nd interest and sinking funds. If the Mayor was
authorized to construe his pledge in favor of those
exemptions, why were not the Supervisors authorized
to construe theirs in behalf of a piedge which they
had made in good faith and which, they were honestly
bound to keep?
The tax levy is 7.7 cents in excess of the pledge cf
$1 upon a total valuation of $.^50,000,000. but all save
two and a fraction cents of that excess was not only
suggested and requested by Mayor Phelan, but it was
1 by the Democratic minority in the Board
of Supervisors aid ratified by the Examiner on Mon
(!ay>Â»Tl' two and a fraction cents wns
levied in pursuance of a pledge given to Rev. Father
Otis iii behalf of St. Mary.-. Park by every Super
visor, including the Democrats. Was not this pledge,
which, was violated by the Democrats, as sacred as
â¦lie other? Who, in short, are guilty of the greater
moral turpitudeâ th( -c Supervi <>rs '.vho honorably
Kept their pledge by following Mayor Phelan's con
struction of the j.'e- !;_:<â . or those who, in order ;<>
make low, partisan politics, broke their plighted faith
to an earnest minister of the Gospel who is striving
to abolish b city plague spoi and elevate the mornls
of the people?
It is difficult 10 discuss with patience a newspaper
which, in the manufacture of partisan polities, thus
falsifies the notorious facts of local history. Per
haps the incident does not justify the feeling we dis
play over it. since the Examine* has' long been
abandoned morally and is beyond reformation. But
it present? us with an opportunity to say what every
fcir-minded man in San Francisco knows to be the
truth, namely, that the present Board of Supervisors
hnve served the public faithfully; that they have kept
all their pledges honestly, and that the record s! lllW c,
them in every respect to be devoted to good, eco
nomical, respectable, efficient and honest government.
Any newspaper which withholds the credit due to such
men â which misrepresents them for political gain
not only works for bad and corrupt government, but
convicts itself of insincerity and base motives.
Justice Rodden has now discovered that the habit
of being "too previous" is one that the public will not
tolerate in a judicial position, and that it is known to
the law by a name almost as ugly as the Justice him
self.
THE SAN FKANCTSCO CALL. WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 20, 1899.
RUSSIA'S CLOSED PORTS.
THE report comes from Copenhagen that
Czar Nicholas has signed a ukase closing for
ever the Russian ports on the Pacific Ocean and
the Baltic and Black seas to any but Russian ships.
to take effect as soon as the Middle Eurffpe canal and
trans-Siberian railway are completed, in 1901. This
: fixes Russian commercial policy as far as "the open
i door" is concerned. Nothing is said of its applica
tion to the ports which Russia will control in China,
but its application to those on the Russianized coast
of Manchuria is probably the reason for its issue.
I Those ports will be gateways to Chinese com
! merce, and Russian occupation is ostensibly in that
irterest.
Since Napoleon's Berlin decree no public act has
been of such interest to the commercial world as this
decree by Nicholas. It brushes all Russian commer
cial treaties aside, and is an act of universal abroga
tion of every such convention entered into between
i the empire and the nations.
To the United States it is of peculiar significance.
Our treaty with Russia, negotiated by James Bu
chanan, December 6, 1832. provides that: "There
shall be between the territories of the high contract
ing parties a reciprocal liberty of commerce and
navigation. The inhabitants of their respective states
shall, mutually, have liberty to enter the ports, places,
rivers and territory of each party, wherever foreign
j commerce is permitted. Russian vessels arriving,
either laden or in ballast, in all ports of the United
i States, and reciprocally vessels of the United States
1 arriving either laden or in ballast in the ports of the
! empire of Russia, shall be treated on their entrance,
during their stay and at their departure, upon the
same footing as national vessels coming from the
same place, with respect to the duties of tonnage. All
kinds of articles of commerce and merchandise which
may be lawfully imported into the ports of the empire
of Russia in Russian vessels may also be imported in
vessels of the United States, without paying other
or higher duties or charges, of whatever kind or de
nomination, levied in the name or to the profit of the
Government, local authorities or private establish
ments whatsoever, than if the said merchandise or
articles of commerce had been imported in Russian
vessels. And. reciprocally, all kinds of merchandise
and articles of commerce may enter the ports of the
United States in Russian vessels upon the same
terms: in each case whether the vessels clear from
ports of the country to which they belong, or from
the ports of any other foreign country. All articles
of commerce and merchandise which may lawfully
be exported from either country in its own vessels
may be exported therefrom in the vessels of either
country on equal terms."
It will l>c seen that the ukase is practically a de
cree of abrogation of every line of this treaty. We
are not aware of the terms of Russian treaties of com
merce and navigation with other nations than ours,
but of course they exist and are abrogated the same
ay ours.
No explanation is made public of the reasons of
policy which have dictated this extraordinary action.
A large commerce has sprung up between San
Francisco and Vladivostok and Russian Pacific ports.
Indeed, our total commerce with Russia has in
creased. In iBgB our trade with that empire, for the
fiscal year ending June .30. was $8,317,573. Of this
$618,015 was with the Russian ports in Asia, and
$252,426 of it went from San Francisco.
( >ur Russian trade for seven months preceding
June 30. iSqq, was $8,103,230. of which $795,006 was
with her Asiatic ports. This commerce is not segre
gated into United States customs districts, so that
San Francisco's -hare is included in the total. The
foreign commerce of this port for the same seven
month- was. in exports, $16,280,026. and in imports
$24,510,006, a total of $40,790,032. It is fair to as
sume, therefore, that we got our share of the increase
with Russian Asia.
In some of its aspects the ukase seems to be a
decree of non-commercial intercourse with the world."
If the other treaty nations retaliate by closing their
ports to Russian ships it is difficult to understand
how Russia could have any foreign commerce at all,
and her position would be exactly like that of China
and Japan before they were forcibly opened to for
eign trade. We have not at hand the statistics which
reveal the volume of Russian foreign trade. In fa
vorable seasons her export of wheat is large, mainly
from Black Sea ports. If the ports of Europe are
closed to her ships, in retaliation, her wheat export
must cease, and what the United States loses in her
direct trade will be more than made good by the re
moval of so formidable a competitor in the bread
stuff market. It may be the ukase is promulgated in
pique' at the failure of the Czar's peace conference, in
which the nations exhibited but little sympathy with
his disarmament proposition, and the effort was a
fiasco. If this is so he has made, practically, a decla
ration of commercial war, and a decree that Russia
shall stew in her own juice and go her own way in
disregard of the rest of the world. Among the inter
national sensations of the year this takes first rank
from a commercial point of view.
To return to San Francisco's interest in it. Our
direct trade with Russian Asia is largely in American
bottoms. Since September. 1808, there have cleared
from this port for Vladivostok the American ships
Lucelle, 1297 tons; Bonanza. 1309 tons; Welna. 1368
tons, and Columbia. 1327 tons. For Nicolaefski the
American ships Volunteer, 542 tons: Nokomis, 462
, tons, and the Vine, 222 tons. For Petropaulofski the
Russian ship Behring. 377 tons, and for Chemainus
the Russian steamer Dolney Vostok. 2265 tons. This
makes a total of 6617 American and 2642 Russian
tonnage cleared from San Francisco, or 9259 total
i tonnage. The employment of seven American ves
sels to those ports from this is not a large but is an
' encouraging item in our foreign trade, and should
1 move our shipping interests to make Government in
quiry into the effect of the ukase upon the treaty cf
! 1832 and our interests thereunder.
According tn some the accidents of the Southern
Pacific Railway are due to too much carelessness,
others say to too much economy, and still others to
j too much Kruitschnitt, and there are reasons for be
lieving if the road were rid of the latter it would expe
j rience less of the other two.
MR. JOHNSON'S HARD TASK
JOHN G. JOHNSON of Kansas is not as yet
a man of national fame, but if he survive the
blizzards of the fall and be not lost in the snow
drifts of winter he is likely to be a prominent and
conspicuous figure in politics along about the begin
ning of next spring, for he has been chosen execu
tive officer of the Democratic National Committee by
the element in favor of harmony, and it will be hid
duty to establish peace in the camp and bring back
'< the revolters of 1896.
It is strange that a man from Johnson's State
should have been chosen as a harmonizer, for Kansas
and harmony are not an accordant combination.
Had it been designed to have a cyclone executive
1 officer who would sweep the country for the career
ing and windy candidate from Nebraska his selec
tion would have been more readily understood. It
is probable, however, that by reason of his long deal
ings with the turbulent factions of. Democracy and
Populism in Kansas Mr. Johnson may have learned
the value of harmony and by practice acquired some
skill in effecting it. At any rate he may be expected
to have a knowledge of the best means of herding up
stampeded steers, and therefore in choosing him for
their leader in the National Committee the friends of
harmony may not have acted so absurdly as most peo
ple will be apt to believe.
The first task set before the new executive officer
is that of harmonizing the Democrats of Kentucky
and bringing the decent element among them to the
support of the regular ticket in order to assure the
election of Goebel as Governor and the re-election of
Senator Blackburn. It will be seen that Mr. John
son's fitness for the work of reuniting national Dem
ocracy has at the outset been subjected to a test of no
ordinary difficulty. The fight in Kentucky has been
one of such an exhausting nature that orators of
repute have been known to collapse in an effort to do
justice to the subject and fall fainting on the stump.
He who quiets that racket will certainly have attested
his right to be intrusted with the still more difficult
task of getting the Palmer and Buckner veterans of
1896 to train in the camp and keep step in the march
with the Bryanites in 1000.
San Jose is discussing the advisability of celebrat
ing with a grand festival the fiftieth anniversary of
the organization of the State government of Califor
nia, which took place in that city December 20, 1849;
and while the event would crowd the Christmas holi
days a little it is probable everybody will have

THE FILIPINO INSURGENTS.
THE imperialist press, in concert, is harping
loudly about Aguinaldo and his relations to the
treaty of Biaknabato. These have been so often
established on the testimony of John Barrett, Consul
Wildman and other imperialists that to continue mis
representing them is puerile. To publish the truth of
history is not to support or defend Aguinaldo. It
is quite remarkable that the imperialist press pursues
exactly the policy for which it impeaches the Filipino
chief. He is called a mercenary adventurer, who sold
his cause to Spain sordidly for gold. His people
have no civilization, and no unity of purpose. He is
a liar and sustains his cause by misrepresentation,
and so on through an endless expletive and epitheti
cal discussion, every substantial statement of which
is flatly contradicted by the facts of history as pub
lished, personally or officially, by United States Con
suls Pratt, Wildman and Williams, and by Dewey,
Professor Schurman, General Miller, General Reeve,
Lieutenant Stickney and the united corps of Manila
correspondents of American newspapers.
The latest contribution to the confusion of the im
perialist press is an article in the August number of
Harper's Magazine, by Lieutenant Calkins of the
navy, who was with Dewey on the Olympia in the
battle of Manila Bay. Between the destruction of
Montijo's fleet and the fall of Manila, and for some
time thereafter, Lieutenant Calkins enjoyed excep
tional opportunities of intercourse with the Filipino
government and people, and became personally ac
quainted with Aguinaldo and his civil and military
officers. He had access to the Spanish archives and
records, and from them compiled material for his ar
ticle on "The Filipino Insurrection of 1896," to which
we call attention.
The imperialist press of this country speaks of it a;,
an outbreak of bandits, which Spain was preparing
to finally crush when we appeared in the islands to
continue and complete her work. Calkins describes
the work we are expected to complete. In one band,
shot to death by Spain, knelt "two millionaires, the
village doctor, lawyer and schoolmaster." In another
man-hunt the Spanish records note the capture and
slaughter of planters, proctors, magistrates, a school
master, a millionaire, and a dramatic poet, "the inso
lent translator into Tagal of the works of Ernest
Renan." After Blanco was furnished an increase of
25.000 soldiers they were hailed by the Spaniards and
banqueted. Don Rafael Comenge, a high official of
the Department of Justice, addressing them, said:
"You are just in time. The cannibals are still in the
woods; the wild beasts arc hiding in their lairs; the
hour has come to exterminate the savages; ferocious
animals must be killed: noxious herbs must be rooted
out; show no mercy; destroy, kill; grant no pardon,
for that is the prerogative of the King, not of the
army. Admit no overtures of peace in the face of
this treason." From these gentle creature!^ it seems
we bought the right to continue their extermination
of the bandits! Blanco was succeeded by Polavieja
as Captain General, who instructed the army that
"rebellion must be wiped out in blood." Then the
public executions began and continued until even the
bloodthirsty Spanish spirit sickened and they were
ordered to take place behind prison walls. Among
the "bandits" thus exterminated was Dr. Rizal, a
graduate and medaler of Spanish and German uni
versities, long the authority in Vienna on ocular de
eases, their surgery and treatment, the author of
"Noli me Tangere" and other books. He was
charged with having agitated for Philippine indepen
dence since his nineteenth year, and his books written
between 1888 and 1892 were produced in evidence
against him. He was led out on the fatal field of
Bagumbayan, and refusing to kneel, was shot to
death.
After the treaty and the banishment of Aguinaldo,
Lieutenant Calkins says, that, suspecting the faith of
Spain, Aguinaldo kept the revolutionary council and
their fund, the money paid to him by Spain, well in
hand, and the money was used to purchase arms for the
conquest of CaVite province in May. 1898, "that cam
paign having been made with arms purchased abroad
or captured from the Spanish troops, and not with the
remnants which the Filipinos were allowed to take
from the arsenal after its capture by Admiral Dewey."
Lieutenant Calkins' article is kept far within the
limit of reserve that must be respected by a navy of
ficer, but Americans reading it will feel little pride
in the purchase by this country of the Spanish right
to exterminate the "bandits" of the Philippines.
Having tried Dreyfus by a military court, the

"WE HAVE SCOTCH'D THE SNAKE, NOT KILLED IT."
DEALING WITH THE DIVORCE PROBLEM.
Different Ways in Which Churches and
States Regard It.
SINCE the marriage of Mrs. Sloane to O. H. P. Belmont the clergy both in
the Eastern and Western States have shown a disposition to be more cau
tious in solemnizing marriages. The General Association of Congrega
tional Ministers of Connecticut has passed resolutions declaring that it is
Incumbent on ministers to exercise the greatest caution before consenting
to officiate at the marriage of any person who has been divorced, and "that such
consent should never bo given in case of the guilty party divorced" for infidelity,
nor for any other reason, without a careful examination Into all the facts. The
Rev. W. M. Barrows of Greenwich, who had accepted a fee of $500 for the Bel
mont-Sloane marriage but had subsequently returned it, claiming that he had
been deceived, was not, however, condemned by the association.
A case somewhat similar to this Connecticut marriage occurred recently in
Michigan. Two persons who, according to the laws of the commonwealth, had
the right to marry were refused by each of the evangelical ministers at Ann
Arbor, on the ground that one. of the applicants had been divorced. These
clergymen later united in an agreement not to perform the ceremony of mar
riage when either of the persons concerned had been divorced or had obtained
;i divorce from a preceding husband or wife on any other ground than violation
of the seventh commandment. In general, the religious press has expressed
approval of this action. Some secular papers, however, think this position
irrational in itself, and derogatory to the laws of the State. For example, the
Brooklyn Eagle says:
"Law itself contains reasons for divorce, equivalent in moral weight to the
reason of infidelity, though different from it. An unexplained absence of
seven years works presumption of death and makes a marriage voidable. So
does a sentence of a certain duration for felony, especially a sentence for
life, which establishes the presumption of civil death. So does proof of a
marriage by force or fraud, or proof that one of the persons to it has not at
taim-d the age of lawful consent. There are other causes which make the
hard-and-fast attitude of the Ann Arbor clergy difficult to maintain, and
would present so many exceptions as to embarrass the clergy there or any
where else.
'â¢Refusal of sundry of the clergy of Michigan to accept the laws of Michi
gan, by which marriageabiltty or remarriageability is allowed, might induce
the law-making power to take away from such clergymen the right to per
form any marriage ceremony at all. It is a legal right, a right conferred by
law, not a right inherent of itself in the ministerial office itself. In France,
any marriage may be ecclesiastically performed, but every marriage, includ
ing these ecclesiastically performed, must also be performed by a civil mag
istrate, else the union Is not legal and resultant children are not legitimate.
Jn America, either the religious or civil ceremony suffices; but marriages
in America, to be valid in France and in some other foreign coun
tries, must be performed before a magistrate here. On that account,
foreigners here are generally married by ministers and 'by magistrates.
Besides, I'nitartan and Universallst ministers, as a rule, take no such rigid
ground as that imputed to the evangelical clergy of Ann Arbor. Uniform
ity of marriage conditions or of attitude toward divorce conditions will not
be possible so long as every State can establish its own rules and so long
as ministers themselves construe their duty in the case for themselves."
A party in the Protestant Episcopal Church has long been endeavoring to
amend the canon concerning divorce by forbidding the solemnization of the
marriage "of any person who has a divorced husband or wife still living, if
such husband or wife has been put away for any cause arising after mar
riage." Bishop Seymour of the diocese of Quincy, 111., has announced his in
tention to offer the foregoing amendment at the next general convention at
San P'rancisco, In October, 1901. Of this the Christian Work says, however:
"There is no fear that the general convention will amend fhe canons Jn
this matter; their action last year is evidence on this point. And why should
the physical death of an Infamous and immoral wife and mother be neces
sary before a pure, good mother can be procured for a motherless family?
Bishop Seymour's proposition has neither reason nor the teaching of Christ
to commend it."
In the meantime the secular arm has also been trying to make the estate of
the divorced a hard one. Mr. Justice Beekman of the New York Supreme Court
has formulated a new plun to defeat "collusion" in divorce proceedings. Although
almost all European governments assume that when both husband and
wife are agreed that their union is no longer tolerant or subservient to
good, this is one of the best of all reasons for their divorce, the laws in this
country take just the opposite ground. If two people, who agree in nothing else,
agree that they must part in order to find life endurable, the legislative or
legal Dogberry feels sure in his soul that here Is "collusion," something particu
larly despicable in his eyes, and that this is the best of all reasons why the
state and church should combine to hold these two together. However, not all
legal students in this country agree with this view. Mr. S. N. Tuckman, writ
ing in the New York Times, says:
"Mr. Justice Beekman very properly .states that the family is the pillar of
the state, and the state by means of laws should preserve its sanctity. This
is very true in the abstract, but 1 am rather inclined to believe that the
husband and wife who cannot live happily together and therefore collude
to divorce are. if constrained to live together, more mischievous to the com
munity and exert a more immoral influence upon their home and children
than they would if they were divorced.
"Let us rather cling to the prosent law, and let matters of matrimony
be permitted to adjust and elevate themselves."
Mr. Allen Carruthers makes an Interesting comparison of the divorce laws of
Europe and the United States. He says:
"Austria grants divorce for 'unconquerable aversion,' on account of which
both parties ask for a divorce. Any court in the Union would dismiss the
petition as collusive where both parties agree to ask for the divorce.
"Hungary has the same law as Austria on this subject.
"Belgium grants divorces on 'mutual or persevering desire or consent of
both parties.'
"Denmark, 'mutual consent.'
"In almost all of the provinces of the German empire divorces are
granted for 'unconquerable aversion.'
" 'Agreement after five years' separation is a valid ground for divorce in
the Netherlands.
"Norway, 'mutual consent.'
"Roumanla, 'mutual and continued desire of both parties.'
"Russia, 'mutual consent.'
"Sweden, 'Incompatibility of temper and persistent discord.'
"Switzerland, which recently adopted a Federal divorce law and amended
the sume generally, grants divorces "where the marriage relations are 'greatly
strained'; also, 'incurable mental diseases of three years" standing,' 'injury to
the Bono* or reputation of either of the parties.'
"The causes just mentioned are far more liberal than any cause known In
America. In fact, some of the causes for which divorce is allowed in Europe
are reasons In most every State in the Union for refusing the divorce \s an
example, 'mutual consent.' While in many instances both parties may want
the divorce, yet if it were known by the court that the application was based
upon 'mutual consent' it would defeat the divorce every time in America Be
sides the causes Just mentioned as an example of the liberality of the divorce
laws of Europe, almost all of the countries of that continent have divorce laws
embracing about all of the causes that we have in America. A great many
are under the Impression that divorce can be obtained in America for 'incom
patibllity of temper.' Yet, as a matter of fact, there is no such cause for dl
vor<*e in any State in the Union."
Mr. Cnrruthers says that there is a marked Increase In divorce both in Furnns
and America, but that this can not be attributed to any fault of our laws for
"the people are back of the laws in every Instance in thin country " He conti'miU
"The report of the Commissioner of Labor referred to by Cardinal <Mh
bons. which was based upon a very careful and disinterested investirntliâ¢
plainly demonstrates that stringent or liberal laws of divorce do not cor r*.
spondlngly decrease or Increase the number of divorces. This is also thiZ"
tention of some of the best writers upon this subject, notably M J fcrni"*
Bertlllon, who is probably the ablest and most exhaustive writer unnn twÂ«
subiect. This Is also borne out by the statistics of various countries
"The fact is. we may Judge our divorce laws and also the number n f
divorces granted by the sentiment of the people. New Yor*. for in<Ua nil tl

BURNING REPLY
TO MARK TWAIN
Denies the Jews Are
Unpatriotic.
Mark Twain, the distinguished, author
â¢Â»2d lecturer, has around a great deal of
adverse criticism among the Jewish resi
dents of this city by reason of the views
he hfts expressed i n an article published
in Harper's September number entitled
'â¢Concerning the â¢-â ,-."
Rev. M. S. Levy, one of the leading
rabbis of this city, took occasion yester
day to rep'.y to Mr. Clemens' sentiments.
His e:oo.u^r.t and burning; reply to the
article wus listened to by a large congre
gation, which filled the Geary-street
temple, the day being marked as the
"Feast of the Tabernacles." There is no
doubt that Dr. Levy's views will create
a sensation throughout the country. Ilia
defense of his brethren is herewith given
in part:
Mr. Twain Introduces his article by Baying:

Accusation number two on the part of Twain
la as follows: It is urged that in civic life
the" Jew is &il right, but he is charged with an
unpatriotic disinclination to stand by the flag

Let va se* how history will sustain Mr.
Twaia in this accusation. In the early Ameri

ihe rame is true of the Jew in every part
cf the world. L*t the French recall the mighty
deeds of Andre Mass^na. Marshal of France:
let the French town of Aries defended
ty the Jews against the Franks and
Burgundia.i*. say if there was any '"dis

d<>?ree of his appreciation of the Jew as pa
triot and soldier. Ask Turkey and Russia of
the Jew at Plevna and they will tell you. and
they will further add that it Is unmaniy and
cowardly to publicly affirm that the Jew will
not stand by his flag. It Is painful to se^r that
patriotism wl.ich is the Jews' greatest pride
used on every occasion to his detriment. It is
a !tt-el on his manhood and an outrage against
history and truth. So much for that part of
Mr. Twain's accuÂ«a.ti<"-n asainst the Jews' dis
inclination to stand by his flag.
Now as to the n*xt accusation: "The Jew as
a money (tetter and with his fat wealth" Is po
litically of no Importance in any country.
So the Jew is a money tetter? I remember
when a boy it wa= a common charge to be
as rich as a Jew. No long*.* can that charge
be' made a*raSr.Â«t him. Perhaps, however, the

FATHER McKINNON ON
PHILIPPINE CONDITIONS
FATHER McKINNON ADDRESSES THE TRUTH SOCIET\
Â£ rr\ HE Catholic Truth Society entertained its friends last night at Metro- %
â¦ I politan Tern] with a musical programme followed by an address by â¦
~ I the Rev. W. D. McKlnnon. chaplain of the First Regiment, California "i
"f Volunteers. ,j
Â£ When Harry TTood Brcwn played the overture on the big organ there +
.. was hardly a vacant seat in the auditorium. He was followed by addresses ;
â¦ by F. J. Kierce and Major J. F. Connolly; sor.gs of every description by â¦
â¢Â«> Herbert Ely. Harry Wood Brown. Miss Ella V. Me ikey and "Billy" Â£
â¦ Hynes. whose three encores terminated with the laughing song which has <}
â¦ made him famous. . â¦
â â¦â  The introduction of Father McKinnon was the occasion of prolonged ap- .
â v plause. The subject of his lecture as printed on the programme was "The â¦
â¦ Californians in the Philippines," but Father McKinnon a.Â«ked to be excused â â¢
5> from talking on this theme and directed his remarks to the Philippines In â¦
â¢â¦" general and conditions as they exist in the islands. He said in part: â¢â¢
When I was In the Philippines I received a letter from an enterprising member *
<*âº of the Catholic Truth Society, asking me to deliver an address before It upon my re- "
-â¢ turn. I readily consented, but hoped that the acceptance would have been forgotten. +
â i' Not having prepared a lecture or an address. I shall talk in a rambling way of the ' :
â¦ Philippine Islands and the many interesting ar.d no-M features of life existing therein. T
Very little cf these islands was known :o the average American when r>Â°wey's guns 1
T Eounded en the Ist at May. From the day whÂ»n Magellan landed on the beautiful there* ,t,
Â«. of the island of Cebu, to the present day, little has been done in the way of their pro- â¦
i> gression. except the Introduction of Christianity. The is!and3 offer erÂ»at commercial â *
a. possibilities, and they have been neglected. The soil is rich, and the variety of prod- v â¢â¦â 
ucts which may be successfully cultivated is great. Everything is in a primitive 'â¦'
I condition, and tribal methods obtain ti all industries. â¦
8> Alter the address a series of beautiful slides were exhibited. Father Me- 4
*â  Klr.non explaining them as thÂ« views were thrown upon the canvas. A <J
â¦ glowing tribute was paid the Archbishop of Manila, whose character and 1
â¦- actions, according to the chaplain, have been much maligned. Father Me- 1
$ Kinnon told of walk up the beach, his entrance into Manila and his re- ..
â¦â  latlona with the Archbishop after the surrender of the city. Word? of-*
praise were bestowed upon the gallant First and its valorous commanders. <i
MAY TROT OUT
THE DARK HORSE
AT ANY MOMENT
Proposed Republican
Nominee for Mayor.
â â¢
The Republican "dark horse" for
Mayor may be brought forth to-day.
Henry T. Scott seemed to be confident
yesterday that the candidate whose
name is held in reserve would be made j
known this evening or to-morrow. "His
consent to make the race." said Mr. j
Scott, "has not been obtained, but I j
believe he will accept the nomination. \
In our marking of first choice he has !
received a majority. Each man attend- j
ing the conference writes his first i
choice of a candidate for Mayor, and i
this 'dark horse' leads the list."
The conference referred to by Mr. j
Scott is a council composed of twelve '
or fifteen citizens who have taken an [
active part in organizing the anti-boss ;
dements of the Republican party in the ;
city. The choice of the conference may
not be the choice of the convention, but
the indorsement of the men who are !
working so earnestly to pet the best ;
men of the city to serve the public is ;
sure to carry weight.
The Republicans are making progress j
in their efforts to induce merchants and j
businÂ»s3 men of known responsibility !
and experience to accept nominations i
for the Board of Supervisors. On the
other hand, the Democrats are mak- :
me but little headway in this direction.
The "old squaws" and the old fossils â 
are besieging the committee of seven
for favorable considei-ation. but the
men whosf 4 services are sought cannot
neglect their business affairs to serve
the city.
The Republicans acknowledge that
they cannot win the office of Mayor and
Assessor except by the hardest kind
of fighting and the presentation of Can
didates of exceptional strength. Last
evening it was ascertained that Super
visor Albert Heyer would accept the
nomination for Assessor. Mr. Heyer
has lived in San Francisco forty years,
and has never been defeated by the
people in an election. He has been a
candidate five times. Once he was
counted out. He is willing to make the
race for Assessor against Dr. Dodge,
and is confident of success at the poll?.
The aspirants for place on the ticket
as candidate for Sheriff are John
Lackmann. Colonel Duboce and Cap
tain Thomas O'Xell. For Auditor W.
G. Doane and Asa R. Wells are can
didates. The list of entries for Public
Administrator is growing. The leaders
in the contest are John Farnham, Will
iam Lyle and the incumbent, Mr.
Drinkh
The meeting of the Republican Con
vention's committee on permanent or
ganization and order of business did
not take place at the Grand Hotel
headquarters last evening. Monday j
afternoon the chairman. A. S. Hubbard,
decided to postpone the meeting and
by postal card gave the members no
tice of the proposed postponement.
Several members failed to receive the!
notice, hence some displeasure was i
manifested when they assembled at !
headquarters last night and found that
the meeting was off.
District delegations throughout the
city nightly listen to the pleading voice
of aspiring- candidates. The Thirty
seventh and Forty-third District dele
gates met last night. The delegates
representing the Thirty-fourth District
will meet at Native Sons' Hall on
Seventeenth street to-morrow evening.
A call is out for a meeting of the
Thirty-sixth District delegation at
Twenty-fourth and Castro streets to
morrow evening.
The Democratic nominating conven
tion will meet at Native Sons' Hall on

There was a meeting of the Repub
i lican deleg-ates of the Thirty-ninth Dis
[ trict last Monday night at 407 Hyd.-
--j street, C. J. King occupied the chair.
j A number of candidates for various of
! fices appeared before the gates and
i made known their political aspirations.
j W. S. L: le, J. B. Farnham and A. Ruef.

candidates for Public Administrator.
Other candidates are Frank French of

ADVEBTISEMENTS.
MRS. PINKHAM says that irritability indicates disease.
Women who are nervous and snappish are to be
pitied. Their homes are uncomfortable ; their dis-
positions grow constantly worse. Such women need the coun-
sel and treatment of a woman who understands the peculiar
. . troubles of her sex.

LEGALITY OF
THE TAX LEVY
IS DISPUTED
County Officials Say
It is Invalid.
"Was the tax levy fixed on Monday by
the Supervisors invalidated by the fact
that the park fund was allowed but .0535
on the dollar instead of .06. as required
by statute? That question was discussed
at greater length yesterday by the pov
erty-stricken heads of municipal depart
ments and their employes than any mat
ter of business that came into the City
Hal! during the day. A rumor that the
levy was invalid was started on the
rounds early in the morning, and the
spirits of those whose salaries were
docked and whose appropriations were
cut to the minimum went up like a sum
mer resort thermometer. That there was
some foundation for the belief was dem
onstrated by a glance at the statutes.
The particular clause which is intended
to assure funds for park purposes reads
as follows:
â â¢The Board of Supervisors. Municipal
Council or other legislative body of any
city or city and county in the State, hav
ing' within its limits parks and ground*
under the control and management of a
Board of Park Commissioners and of an
area or acreage of more than ten acres.
la hereby authorized and empowered to
ievy and collect each year in the mode
prescribed by law for the levy and col
lection of taxes a tax of not less than 6
nor more than 10 cents upon each $100 on
the assessed valuation of taxable prop
erty within such city or city and county.
tor the purpose of preserving, maintaln
.ng and Improving the parks and grounds
under the control of such Board of Park
Commissioners."
To this section the Park Commissioners
called the attention of the Board of Su
pervisors when it submitted its first levy
but when the levy adopted by the board
on Monday was considered on Sunday by
the Mayor and Supervisor Perrault they
â lecided to ignore it and fix a lower rig
ure. They contend now that even if the
aw made"it mandatory upon the board to
set aside 6 cents for park purposes the
whole levy would not be Invalidated If it
failed to do so.
In that opinion the most prominent at
torneya in the city agree. District At
torney Murphy said last night that it was
a matter upon which he would refuse to
clve an offhand opinion, but that he could
hot conceive of any such result arising
out of a slight dereliction of duty on the
r.art of the Supervisors. Garret McEner
hey was of the same opinion. E. S. Pills
burv looked well Into his law books and
rendered the same decision. The attor
neys were a unit on that point, and had
only a few of the Supervisors and heads
jf departments to disagree with them.
The point is one that has never been
tested in the courts, and probably will
not te on this occasion, as the commis
sion most affected, the Park Commission,
ha* announced through Mr. Zeile that it
will take advantage of no such opportu
nity to raise the money it deems neces
sary for park purposes. However, any of
the well-slashed heads or any taxpayer
may throw th- matter into court and
-ettle the question once and for all.

A COMMON TROUBLE.
Thousands Suffer From It
Without Knowing Its Real
Character. i
â No trouble Is more common or more
misunderstood than nervous dyspepsia.
People having it think that their nerves
are to blame, are surprised that they are
not cured by nerve medicines and spring ;
remedies; the real seat of mischief Is lost !
sight of; the stomach is the organ to be
looked after. i
Nervous dyspeptics often do not have ;
any pain whatever in the stomach, nor i
perhaps any of the usual symptoms of
stomach weakness. Nervous dyspepsia
shows itself not In the stomach so much ,
as in nearly every i yi-r organ; in som: â¢
cases the heart palpitates and is irreg- !
ular: in others the kidneys are affected; j
in others the bowels are troubled, with
loss of flesh and appetite, with the accu-
mulation of gas. sour risings and heart- ;
burn.
Mr. A. W. Sharper of No. 61 Prospect !
street. Indianapolis, Ind., writes as fol-
lows: "A motive of pure gratitude!
prompts me to write these few lines re- '
garding the new and valuable medicine, j
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets. I have been
a sufferer from nervous dyspepsia for the
last four years; have used various patent
medicines and other remedies without any ,
favorable result. They sometimes gave
temporary relief until the effects of the
medicine wore off. I attributed this to
my sedentary habits, being a bookkeeper
with little physical exercise, but I am
glad to state that the tablets have over-
come all these obstacles, for I have
gained in flesh, sleep better and am better
in every way. The above Is written not
for notoriety, but Is based on actual facts.
Respectfully yours, j
"A. W. SHARPER,
"61 Prospect St., Indianapolis. Ind."
It is safe to say that Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablets will cure any stomach weakness
or disease except cancer of the stomach, j
They cure sour stomach, gas, loss of flesh
ami appetite, sleeplessness, palpitation,
heartburn, constipation and headaches.

EASTERN MARKETS
New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK, Sept. 19.- The delicate tension
of tlio speculative tfmper was Illustrated by
the course of to-day's market, which seemed
to he going prosperously on Its way toward
ration and recovery In prices until tho
If hour of the trading. After that time
prices were bowled over In every direction,
]ik>- :t set of ten pins which had been set up
i be knocked down attain. The st- 11-
Ing movement waa in full force when the
marki I I i>rlces tending rapidly down-
Borne â  f the earlier Rains were held
ih'Hi^h In other prominent stocks the notable
leved earlier in the day was most
i. wiped out. The market pave every appear
r having thrown off the Incubus of the
money scare. The reports from abroad were
of n more conciliatory attitude on the part of
lent Kruger, and the decision of the
nt to pardon Dreyfus caused
:; rally in foreign markets. There as well as
the phort Interest had been largely over
ded and they found some difficulty in
securing Itoclci to cover short contracts. Pro
al operators who hnd secured stocks at
lay's low level had turned hull and there
was a fair volume of buying in commission
| houses, attracted by yesterday's lute recovery
in prices. Prices were marked high at the
opening and trading was very active for a
time, but on a descending scale. After prices
had got back to near yesterday's close a
i demand of substantial character developed for
I standard railroad stocks. Some of the special
ties, notably the New York traction stocks,
! which have suffered violent losses, were
I marked up rapidly. Late in the day a very
1 buoyant tone carried the coalers upward under
â  the lead of Laekawanna, which advanced an
extreme 114. Other members of the group
rose from 24 to 4 points. Metropolitan's ex
treme rise was 64. Brookly Transit was up at
] one time 4%. Many other specialties were up
I between 2 and 3 points, and the active rail-
I roads very generally showed gains of from
1 to IV Such was the state of affairs when
traders began to take profits in the coalers
and Metropolitan Street Railway. It did not
! take the bears long to wipe out all of the
gains In Brooklyn Transit, and the course of
prices turned quickly downward. The selling
movement continued actively until the close.
The advance in prices was accompanied by pro
fessions of confidence that the money market
difficulties had been passed. Call money ruled
at 6 per cent and above during the day. The
banks are not losing quite as heavily as last
week, either to the sub-treasury or to the in
terior. But the outward movement of money
' is more than sufficient to make Inroads upon
' the legal reserve of the banks. It Is known
i that many loans which have been called have
; been placed with other borrowers or have re
sulted simply in a shifting of collaterals while
the loan was marked up but I? ft otherwise
undisturbed. Reports found currency that con
siderable money had been placed in call loans
for account of Canadian banks. One New-
York bank took out additional circulation in
Washington to the amount of 1250,000, which
notes had already been printed and mad*
1 available for circulation. Except in these
cases there Is no evidence of any actual re
plenishment of cash for the New York market,
nor is any discernahle in the Immediate future.
Bankers express the oponion that money will
continue hard at 6 per rent or above. One
of the vagaries of the situation is that sterling
exchange held stead'- to firm to-day with buy-
Ing for London account of over 18. 000 shares
of stocks, -while it dropped sharply yesterday
In spite of London's selling of over 40.000
shares. Competent authorities do not look for
gold imports until much later In the fall.
Bonds showed gains and held better than
stocks In the late weakness. Total sales, par
value, 12,290,000.
United States bonds were unchanged in bid
quotations.

Chicago Grain Market.
CHICAGO, Sept. 19.â The opening: In Wheat
was at a slight advance for December, that
option starting at 704'8<70<S,c, or K0!4o oorv *r
yesterday's final price. Outside of an unex
pectedly small Increase In the local contract
stocks there' was nothing In the news to war
rant an advance, and It appeared to be purely
the result of local sentiment. The small ad
vance was almost Immediately lost. Heavy
selling, which marked yesterday's session and
which was supposed to be liquidation of some
long lines, was continued to-day. There was
also some selling from the outside. St. Louis
and the Northwest both being In the market.
For a considerable period the December price
hung around TO^fe'aWic, to which point It de
clined shortly after the opening, but before n
o'clock the strength of Corn began to attract
attention. Bullishness caused by this was In
creased by reports that a good deal of the
buying was for Armour. This scared shorts
and caused covering, offerings were light,
outside of the long liquidation referred to, and
prices fluctuated rapidly within a compara
tively narrow range, the market at times ex
hibiting some nervousness. The local crowd
was apparently long, and though the posting
of Bradstreet's figures on the visible supply,
ehowlnjj an increase of 6,098,000 bushels, shook
out prime long Wheat, offerings were readily
absorbed and the spell of weakness soon dis
appeared. During the afternoon the strength
of coarse grains was influential in the steadi
ness of Wheat, and although bear attacks were
frequent, prices were well maintained to the
end. L,ittle waa done in September. Interest
In that deal had apparently died out and prices
kept close to the opening priceâ 7o%câ most of
the session. December was bringing 70% cat
the close.
Trading In Corn was quite active, especially
for September, in which a sharp advance was
recorded. Shorts were active bidders from the
start, but had a good deal of difficulty in
covering and prices were bid up accordingly.
December closed %ft^c higher. September
gained l^c.
Oats were helped by the strength of Corn
and ruled firm all day, December closing 14c
higher.
Provisions were dull and steady, sympathy
with the grain markets being the main factor.
There wan a good demand for meats. Pack
ers were ">n both sides of the market. Frl^s
kept within a narrow rani;e. At the close
January Perk and Laird were a shade higher
and rose 2%c higher.

OREGON.
PORTLAND, Or., Sept. 19.â Portland export
ers have been forroi! out of the market by
high-priced wheat and high-priced ships. Either
one or the other might have been met sepa
rately, but combined they have brought mat
ters to a ntandstill. San Francisco men are
chartering ships to go from the north to the
Bay city at a figure which would mean an
actual loss of 3 or 4 cents per bushel if Port
land dealers were to attempt to fill them here.
At the lowest rate Intimated for a ship in this
port. Walla Walla would not be worth m.jre
than r.S cents per bushel, but very little can
be purchased at that figure. In fact, some
sales of heavy weight are mnde at less than
f.9 and 60 cents. Valley Is in much better con
dition, nominally COiiieic. Bluestem Is quoted

old-time millinery. One of the pret

the "thee and thou" people of the last
century. Mrs. Walter Matthews is the
owner of this Interesting Quaker ex
hibit. Mrs. Weston has loaned a deli
cate Fayal lane cap that was new 120
years ago. In the old State of Maine,
when this century was but a few years
old, brides wore very primitive white
silk caps at the altar, judging by the
specimen on exhibition. In 1780, in the
Isle of Man, a 17-year-old descendant
of Barbara Standish wore a quaint
little hat that attracts much attention.
Mrs. Fish is exhibiting a cap worn by
her grandmother, a member of the
Knickerbocker family, 104 years ago.
An exhibit in the shape of a baby's
hood, exquisitely wrought with solid
silver lace and beautifully designed,
is shown, which was worn by the early
Dutch in the seventeenth century. A
riding hat of fifty years ago would
make the modern equestrienne wish to
hide herself when she saw any of her
fashionable friends coming. As near
as possible it resembles a bean pot
made of felt.
The hideous nightcaps of two pen

modern burglar had he sighted one at
the head of the stairs.

ALLEGED SCANDAL IN OIL.
Rumor of Rottenness in Government
Contracts Is Circulated.
The charge has been unofficially made
that the Government has been paying
more for the oil necessary to lubricate
the machinery in the army transports
than is warranted by the prices ruling in
the market. No proof, other than an in
terview with a local dealer, who has been
unsuccessful in securing another con
tract, has been submitted. That inter
view Is from Charles M. Vates of Yan-s
& Co.. which firm furnishiHl oil at 60
cents a gallon for the transports Han
cock Grant and Sherman, the Standard
Oil Company now having the contract at
32 cents a gallon. In that interview he
said:
I am not going to make any charges about
the trouble over the <>!! we furnished the
transport Hancock. There was a complaint
made to the quartermaster's department
and I went to see Colonel Long at nnce. It
appears that the chief engineer said In a
mport that the oil wan too light for the
heavy machinery of that vessel. That ig a
matter which could easily l>e rectified, and I
so explained to Colonel Long. I heard no
more after that, but I see we did not gtt
any more contracts. In tart, the next thing
I heard was that the Standard Oil Company
had been successful In securing a contract
for "1000 barrels, mÂ»ne or leHB." as the
tenders read, at 32 cents a gallon.
Colonel Long, the head of the quarter
master's department, refuses to make
any statement on the matter, as doea \V.

Company. It is said, however, that the
new contract, which Yates did not get,

Besides thÂ« hat of history there is
also the hat of commerce. While a
couple of tables contain hats, every

HER HOME-MADE
REMEDY NEARLY
DROVE HIM MAD
Pantoskey Answers
His Wife's Charges.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, Sept. 19.
The sensational charges of cruelty and I
Intemperance made by Rica Pantoskey
against her husband. Herman Pantoskey,
in her suit for the recovery of $75 month
ly for her maintenance and support, have
been met in an interesting and amusing i
answer and cross-complaint tiled by the
defendant this afternoon through his at
torney, D. Mitchell.
After denying each and every specific
charge of inflicting grievous bodily in
jury and mental Buffering upon the plain
tiff, or that he reviled her with the ap
probrious name of "thief" and "igno
ramus," and that she is destitute of
means, the aged defendant avers that
while he is possessed of some real estate,
it is mortgaged for $530, and that his
place of business is worth not over $150.
He denies that he has money on deposit
in banks, or that he has any intention
of disposing of bis earthly goods. He
denies also that there was any necessity
of bringing the suit, except for the pur
pose of Rica's "personal gain, revenge
and aggrandizement." For his second de
fense Pantoskey alleges:
''That he is 70 years of age, and for
two years last past has been and now
is suffering from mental and physical ail
ments, and therefore it became and was
an advertised necessity that he should
take some one to assist and care for him
In his age and infirmities.
"That plaintiff Rica, being without a
home or means of support and learning
of Herman's supposed wealth and great
ness, 'came from afar' not laden with
her jewels and precious stones, as she
had previously left same with her uncle,
and Bhe then offered him her love, heart
and hand and became his bride in Jan
uary, 1899; and as a dutiful wife prom
ised to love, honor and obey and to care
fully nurse defendants property and per
son Kut said plaintiff has not kept said
promise, but has willfully broken and de
parted ih'Tefrom."
The cross-complaint further alleges that
in February last the bride of one short
month "upon learning that defendant
was much indebted, requested that he
should turn over to her all his property
and I hereby defeat his creditors, and also
simultaneously demanded that her adult
son Simon Bendlt (an inmate of a house
of correction for felony), should on his re
lease therefrom come and reside with
plaintiff and defendant in their home in
Oakland and that he be by defendant
Bupported and established In their home,
although he is abl< -bodied, aged 27 years,
and well able to care for himself."
\ho\it the same time, according to the
cross-complaint, "Rica demanded a large
sum of money with which to release her
jewelry alleged to be pawned in San Fran
cisco by her or her Bon Simon." Herman's
vigorous refusal to me<-t these demands
resulted In the wife becoming aggressive,
disappointed and insulting until she finally

"called defendant a criminal." Moreover
"she pointed to the ground and wished
for his death and prayed that he would
endure- everlasting suffering here and
hereafter. * * * Then plaintiff threat
ened to therefrom hate, vex, leave and
abandon defendant." , . .
Another complaint of Herman Is that
last June, when he was suffering from a
wounded head and otherwise, plaintiff ad
ministered to him a so-called remedy med
icine 'of her own make' that so disas
trously affected him in mind and body as
to drive him partly insane and unaccount
able for his actions."
In conclusion, the aged defendant de
clares that he always abundantly supplied
Rica with every comfort and kindness and
money necessary in their station of life,
and that even since she deserted him he
has repeatedly requested her to return and
share his home and happiness with him,
but instead she continues "to live apart
from him and their home, with the object
Of coercing from him by her action means
to establish another home, out of this

and possible ruin in the premises." Mr.

the Arrest of Dr. Kohl and Mrs.
Dr. Kohl.
Coroner Hill Issued a warrant yesterday
morning- for the arrest of John Doe and
Jane Doe on a charge of manslaughter,
the victim being Mrs. Katie Walsh, who
died at the Brunswick House <>n Sixth
street last Monday morning from the ef
fects of a criminal operation.

Mrs. Dr. Kohl of 1122 Market street and
that Mr. Dr. Kohl, her husband, was
called in afterward to save the patient's
lit. . which he failed to do. The jury,

fect that the deceased came to her death
at the hands of parties unknown to the
jury.
A pubpena had been issued for the
Kohls to attend the inquest and testify in
thf case, but they could not be found.

Mrs. Dr. Kohl," he said.
The warrant was placed In the hands of
the police, with instructions to arrest Dr.
Kohl and Mrs. Dr. Kohl. The name of
the latter Is found in the medical register

Millionaire Tells How
He Was Wooed.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Sept. 19.
John Nicholl, the aged Alameda County
capitalist, took the stand in his own be
half this afternoon in Judge Ogden's court
and offered testimony whijih hQÂ£ attorneys
are confident will squash Miss Hodge's
breach of promise suit. Previous to put
ting Xicholl on the stand McKee made his
opening statement to the jury, in which
he affirmed that the defense, among other
things, expected to prove that Nicholl is
physically and mentally much enfeebled.
Mr. McKee's client did not make good
the mental end of his attorney's suue
meni. Physically the old man is not in
good condition. The heavy stick he car
ries Is not a matter of fashion, but of
necessity. He hobbled up to the witness
stand and his whole bearing plainly
shewed his 77 years. Physically he Is
weak, but it is an Injustice to the vigor
ous old man to speak of feeble-minded
ness. Mr. Nicholl needed no prompting ro
remember dates nor ligurts, nor conver
sation, nor the contents of letters he
either received or dictated. He has a
gond memory and a sound brain, and he
showed it in spite of his counsel.
According to his story, he did not woo
and win Miss Hodge. She courted him
and got his consent, on conditions, to wed
her. "On the 10th of November," the wit
ness said, "I took Miss Hodge out riding.
AYe went out Fourth avenue to the top of
the ridge, east to Thirteenth street, on to
Diamond Canyon and past the Dlngee
place. We stopped alongside the place
and looked over and through the fence at
some deer there. Then she said, '1 have
an old dear alongside me in the buggy.'
Previous to that she had been hugging
up to me and calling me darling. During
the ride Jane talked of Mrs. Boyd,"
Nicholl went on to explain, "and of her
property. She said the Griffin crowd was
striving to win the affection of Mrs. Boyd
from her so as to get the Washington
street property. 'If Aunty Boyd should die
without a will.' she said, 'it would be a
year before anything could be done, and
during that time she (Jane) would have
no home."
It was while dolefully reflecting upon
her homeless condition that Miss Hodge
proposed to Nicholl. The lady wasted no
endearing terms, but stated her case
clearly and said: "If you would take me
over to your home I would make It so
pleasant you would be astonished." "But
the girls?" said the old man she was pro
posing to; "they will probably kick."
"I'll see the girls." said Miss Hodge.
"All right." said Nicholl: "if you get the
consent of the girlsâ otherwise no." Miss
Hodge did not get the consent of the girls.
"On the 7th of December." testified
Nicholl, "I went to see Jane. I told her
my daughter, Mrs. Wilson, was making
such a fuss about the engagement and
saying she was ashamed of me and
ashamed of Jane. 'If they are kicking so
much,' she said, 'it is all off and you can
go and tell the girls.' "
Mr. Nioholl on his cross-examination
showed that he had come to California In
UNITED STATES BRANCH.

CROCKER ESTATE CHANGES
CROCKERS SAID
TO HAVE SOLD
THEIR STOCK
Speyers the Alleged
Buyers.
THIRTEEN MILLIONS INVOLVED
â¢
RUMOR CREATES A SENSATION
IN FINANCIAL CIRCLES.
The rumor current In this city yester
day afternoon that the Crockers had dis
posed of their entire holdings in the
.Southern Pacific and Central Pacific
Hailroad companies to the backing firm
of Speyer & Co., of New York, created
intense excitement In financial circles.
While no positive confirmation of the
Btory was obtained, the source of in
formation is reliable, and It was generally
accepted as correct.
What lends color to the rumor is the
fact that neither George nor Will Crocker
would discuss the matter and refused to
affirm or deny it. When George Crocker
was asked whether the report was true
or not he quickly replied:
"Go ask Mr. Speyer. Probably he will
tey you," and he positively declined to
Bay any more about it.
Will Crocker was just as averse to dis
cussing the subject as his brother, and to
aJI Questions regarding it answered that
he did not care to speak about affairs
which he considered private and of no
possible public concern.
The firm of Speyer & Co. is widel>
known and has houses In Amsterdam ,
London and New York. It has en
gineered some very important financial
deals for C. P. Huntington, and recently
put through the famous reorganization
of the Central Pacific and its consolida
tion with the Southern Pacific. James
Speyer. a representative of the concern,
was" in this city a few months ago, and
it was probably at that time that he had
the Crocker deal in view. It is said that
the linn has placed over $L!o,0uu,000 in
bonds for Huntlngton. and it counts
among its patrons some of the wealthiest
people in Europe.
It was impossible to ascertain for whom
the Speyers were acting in the purchase of
the Crocker interests. It is supposed, how
ever, that they were acting lor some for
midable money power, and the names or
the Vanderbilts and even Huntlngton
himself are mentioned in this connection.
It is understood that all of the Crockers
have disposed of their stock. There are
five Of them and they together own a
fifth Interest In the property. It is
valued at about ?13.w0,00'J, and comprises
34U.U00 shares of the stock.
The Call's correspondent in New lorK
saw James Speyer last night in that city
and asked him if the story was correct
that he had purchased the Crocker In
terests in the Central and Southern Pa
cine Railway corporations. Mr. opeyer
declined to discuss the subject. ihe
Crockers here in San Francisco decline
to be interviewed on the topic. It is sig
nificant that none of the parties con
cerned deny the reported transaction.
James Speyer. president of the London,
Amsterdam and New York banking insti
tution of Speyer & Co., was in this city
last April. While here he purchased Mrs.
Stanford's holdings of Central Pacific
-tuck. He attended the meeting of Cen
tral Pacific dirtctors to arrange for the
absorption of the Central by the South
ern Pacific, and was accepted as C. P.
Jluntmgioii's ally in the reorganization
B Â°Chauncey M. Depew, who was seen in
New York last night by a Call ccrre
. ni. asserted positively that the
A anderbilts have nothing to do with the
Southern Pacific Kail way.
CALIFORNIANS AS HOSTS.
Fair Ladies of Company L En
tertain the Minnesotans.
To show their appreciation of the kind
ness extended to their brothers, sons and
husbands in Manila the lady relatives of
the men of Company L, gave a noonday
breakfast last Saturday to the members
of Company L. of the Minnesota regiment.
The affair took place in the company din
ing roorii, which had been turned over
to the fair hostesses, by whom it had
been converted into a bower of Lucullan
loveliness. A profusion of flowers decor
ated the table, and if here and there the
frosted top ot a cake or the glistening
neck of a large cold bottle happened to
i poke its way through the petals of the
' posies the tact detracted nothing from
: the loveliness of the ensemble as viewed
by the hungry eyes of the warriors from
the battlefields of Luzon.
At the appointed hour the California
boys marched over to the Minnesota camp
and escorted back the guests that there
awaited them. Over two hundred men sat
down to the table and made havoc of the
: things with which it was loaded,
while their gentle entertainers hovered
over them and took Rood care that all
thfir wants should be promptly admin
istered to.
At thr- end of the meal Captain Eggert
arose and on behalf of the men or his
company bade the Minnesota contingent
welcome In a few well chosen and appro
priate words in which he endeavored to
convey to the guests the deep apprecia
tion with which the courtesies they had
extended to the men from Frisco while In
Manila bad been received. When he con
cluded Captain Morgan arose and an-
BWered for himself and the men of his
company. Then came cheers for the
hostesses, the different companies, the
officers and for everything else, after
which cigars were lighted and all sat at
ease to listen to the songs. Jests and sto
ries that wore away the better part of
the afternoon.
Among the ladles who contributed to
make the affair a success were Mrs. Oap
tJiin Etrfcert, Mrs. Lieutenant Grundman,
the Misses Adler. Mrs. Meyers, Mrs.
Kahn. Mrs. Grant. Mrs. Mangles, Mrs.
LefTman, Mrs. Burke, Mrs. S. Aufrichtlg
and a number of others whose names
could not be learned.
WARRIORS DINE.
Company B of the California
Regiment Entertains Its
Minnesota Friends.
T.nst night sounds of revelry floated
through the corridors of the Occidental
Hotel and the lights in the Wg dining
room shone over 201 and more brave men
who hud come together to carve the fowl
of peace, after having spent a year and
over in plucking the tail feathers out
of the Spanish and Tagalo birds of war.
The occasion was a dinner given by
Company H of the California regiment
to Company B of the Minnesota com
mand in recognition of the many courte
siea extended by the men of the north
to our San Francisco lads while both
regiments were making the best of their
stay in Manila.
The tables were beautifully decorated
and a string orchestra in attendance lent
the charm of music to the more substan
tial charms emanating from savory
dishes and properly cooled bottles.
When the cigar stage was arrived at
CaptaJn Filmer of the Californians, act-
Ing as toastmaster, made an address of
welcome, and then called upon the dif
ferent gentlemen to respond to the fol
[owlng toasts, which each one did in a
manner which Wâ¬;nt to show that when
the volunteers are mustered out and re
turn to civil life the nation will not want
for men capable of defending its honor
in the field of oratory any more than it
lacked men to uphold the dignity of its
flag in the field of battle: "State of Min

(orni i." Colonel W. P. Sullivan; "Our
Country," Mayor Phelan; "The Ladies."
Lieutenant Ben Sturdlvant; "Our De
parted Comrade*," Sergeant Clifford. Be
tween the toasts songs were rendered and
stories told, and all went merry, as all
should when warriors, their fighting over,
assemble to enjoy the fruits of their vic
tories. Dr. W. H. Sieberst with, his tin
SPEYER BOUGHT
A BIG BLOCK
OF THE STOCK
NEW YORK, Sept. 19.â The Journal to
day says: A large share in the Central
and Southern Pacific railways has been
bought by Speyer & Co., bankers of this
city.
It was said last night by a gentleman
conversant with the affairs of the two
companies that Speyer & Co. had ar
ranged recently to purchase a large biock
of these securities but he could not tell
whether the Interest acquired was the
Crocker or the Stanford holdings.
The Journal's informant, however,
said he could deny the report that the
deal was partly a Vanderbilt scheme for
the control of the transcontinental rail
way system.
"There is no Vanderbilt money In this,"
he continued. "Mr. Speyer has been very
friendly to C. P. Huntlngton. The firm
put through the reorganization of the
Central Pacific. Mr. Speyer is not buy
ing, as I understand it, for Mr. Huntlng
ton, but is taking over, as opportunity
offers, the holdings of others who are
not in sympathy with Mr. Huntington's
Interests, and will hold them on his own
account."
Mr. Speyer was in San Francisco a
short time ago, and it was understood at
that time that a large deal in Central
Pacific was in the wind.
The Sun says: Senator Depew said last
night that the Vanderbilts had no inter
ests in any such deal. James Speyer,
head of the firm of Speyer & Co., refused
to discuss the report. He has recently
returned to town. There has been talk in
Wall street lately about an "important
move" coming in the stock. It has been
dealt In heavily of late, the price ranging
between 40 and 35. About 30.000 shares
were sold yesterday, the closing price
being 35%.
whistle and Lloyd Spencer with his coon
songs contributed more than a little to
make the good time what it was.
TO WELCOME OTHERS.
A meeting of the citizens' executive
committee ''on the reception of California
volunteers from Manila on board the
Sherman was held in Mayor Phelan's
office yesterday afternoon. There were
present: Mayor Phelan, M. H. de Young,
W. J. Martin and Secretary McPlke.
During the session of the committee a
delegation from the parents' association
consisting of J. W. Burson, J. R. Baird,
L, N. Jacobs, J. J. McCarthy and E. C.
Brackett called and requested that ar
rangements be made for the reception
and banqueting of the returning regulars
now on the way from Manila on board
the City of Para, its hospitalities to be
extended to all of the men who belong
to California and who enlisted in other
regiments, as though they had belonged
to the First Regiment of Volunteers, and
the reception to partake, if possible, of a
naval parade on a small scale. The com
mittee decided to give the returning
soldiers a breakfast in the east nave of
the ferry building, provided the Harbor
Commissioners would permit.
After disposing of this the committee
settled down to render an account of the
financial feature of the late reception.
The following was issued to the press
representatives present:

COMES TO MEET HIS
NORTHERN FIGHTERS
GOVERNOR ROBERT B. SMITH, MONTANA'S EXECUTIVE.
GOVERNOR Robert B. Smith, accom
panied by the delegation who have
come with him to receive the re
turning volunteers, arrived in this
city yesterday morning from the north.
The Governor himself went to the Occi
dental, but the rest of the party split up
and are registered at the different host
elries around town.
When seen yesterday in his apartments
the Governor said that while no definite
plans had been made for the entertain
ment of the soldiers when they should
get back to their home State, yet money
was being rapidly collected, and by the
time the troops are mustered out things
will be in suoh a shape as to assure them
a reception in every way worthy of their
great achievements.
If there Is enough money collected, and
the Governor is certain there will be. the
troops will be onrrled from this city to
their homes at the expense of the people
of the State whose renown they have
done so much to extend throughout the
entire land.
Aa soon, as the Governor had rested and
MARY CROCKER
NOW POSSESSES
HER MILLIONS
An Order Is Made by
Judge Coffey.
FINAL ACCOUNT IS SETTLED
THE HAPPY HEIRESS APPEARS
TO SIGN DOCUMENTS.
Miss Mary Crocker, eldest child of the
late Charles Fred Crocker, formally came
into possession of the vast legacy left her
by her deceased father yesterday. Her
share of the Crocker estate is valued at
something over $4,000,000, and by the order
of Probate Judge Coffey she is now free
to handle this great wealth, as she will
be unhampered by the dictates of a trus
tee or guardian.
Miss Crocker attained her majority on
the 7th of the present month, Charles E.
Green and Henry T. Scott, executors of
the will of Colonel Crocker and guardians
of the person and estate of the young
woman, then prepared their final account.
This was presented in court yesterday
afternoon, the account was accepted atid
the order of distribution made. In this
account It is set forth that during the
months covered, from March to Septem
ber of this year, the receipts have been
$194,217 90; disbursements, $90,917 85, leav
ing a balance on hand of $103,300 03. For
services rendered on behalf of their wards
the guardians asked $10,660 2-3, and the at
torneys, Morrison & Cope, $3333 1-3. This
deduction of $20,000 from the account re
duced the balance to $53,300 05. Miss Crock
er, who was present in court and appar
ently happy that she was now legally
qualified to care for her own interests,
took her pen and entered at the head or
the account that she had examined it
carefully and had no suggestions to offer.
Judge Coffey then ordered the account
settled.
The strong box containing the Crocker
securities, which have for some time been
in the vaults of the Crocker-Woolworth
National Bank, wus then placed on the
bench and opened in the presence of
Judge Coffey. This box contains 649 1-20
shares of the Southern Pacific Company,
valued at $16,226 26; 437 shares Southern
Pacific Railroad Company, valued at $3800;
250 shares Oakland Water Front Com
pany, valued at $3000; 527 shares Rocky
Mountain Coal and Iron Company, valued
at $26,300; 100 shares Wells, Fargo & Co.,
valued at J10.500; 20,340 shares Market
Street Railway Company, valued at $966,
--150; 12&6 shares Crocker-Woolworth Na
tional Bank, valued at $231,480; 19.999
shares Crocker Estate Company, valued
at $3,999,800; 100 shares Union Iron Works,
valued at $10,000; 100 shares Promontory
Ranch Company, valued at $10,0o0; United
States Government 4 per cent bonds, val
ued at $275,000. Total worth of securities,
$5,567,306 25.
Miss Crocker's division of the securities
were selected, shown to her and then set
apart from the rest In the strong box. It
was again sealed up, and then the heavy
burden was taken back to the bank. Aftxr
the ceremony had been concluded Miss
Crocker, accompanied by her attorneys,
left the court.
In about six years from now this cere
mony will be repeated. Charles Temple
ton Crocker is now 15 years of age, and
his sister, Jennie Adeline Crocker, is 12.
Hence they will come of age within a few
months of each other, and it is very prob
able that one ceremony will suffice for the
distribution of their securities to them.
In the meantime their estate will greatly
Increase in value, and when they come
into possession of their estates they will
be, like their sister, numbered among the
richest young people in the United States.
