morning to light his way over the !
hill to Antipolo. General Law- j
ton's plan was (o have General j
H^ll drive the native troops from
Antipolo toward Laguna de Bai,
and finally attack their front at
Taytay. Thus the strong force oil
insurgents there might have' been
crushvd. It was a magnificent

plan, but failed of complete elic
cess because it took seven hours
for Hall's troops to cover the dis
tance, expected to have been
made in two. and gave the insur
gents time to get out.
The failure of Hall to get
through to Antipolo was due to
[ a fight in the hills four miles out
of that town. The Oregon reH
ment and a detachment of the i
Fourth Cavalry suffered some- i

what in the encounter. The insur
gents fired upon the attacking
column from strong trenches I
high up on the mountain side,

and although driven from these !
kept up a running fight for sevr
eral hours. .
At 2 o'clock in the afternoon
the column under Colonel Whol
ley of the First Washington start
ed from Pasig for Taytay. From
the heights above the pumping
station . General Lawton could
see and direct both columns over
the San Mateo Valley. Just as
Hall's command disappeared
over the â  hills in the distance;
Wholley's column came in sight,
moving with great rapidity. Al
most before one realized it the '
column had swept with its skir- '
. lishing line clear' across four]
miles of the valley toward Tay
tay. Both the insurgents and res
idents fled panic stricken into the I
hills before the impetuous rush of !
the American soldiers. Two men
of the Twelfth Infantry were
killed before the town. The place
was later shelled for half an hour.
MOVEMENT TO HEM IN A
LARGE FORCE OF ENEMY
NEW YORK, June 4. â A Washington Bpecial to the Herald says: In
dispatching Genera] Lawton to capture Morong, Major General Otis is
understood to have proposed to destroy <>r drive back the strong force
of Insurgents which have been operating from that section against the
Pasitr River line There is no expectation here that Lawton's column will
go far from the river or lakes, upon which supplies will be carried to
him.
The authorities appreciate the extreme difficulties of the campaign
during the rainy season, and ;ii! that they expect is that the American
forces will make short incursions Into the enemy's country and break up
any Large orgsmlsaiions which may establish themselves in the vicinity
of Manila, especially near Laguna <le BaL It is apparent from the line
which tiawton is following and the dispatch of the Washington troops
t<> .Morong, that it is hoped to gÂ«-t the Insurgents between that point, Tay
mdAntipolo and the lake hemmed in so that they can be destroyed or
captured.

General Lawton in person di- '.
rected the right column this
morning in an attack upon Tay-
I tay. Xo resistance was encoun
tered, the enemy retreating after 1
I burning the church and part oJ

! flight of the people. . .

column in Taytay at 10 o'clock
in the morning. His total loss
! during" the march was five men !
killed and nine wounded.
Lawton spent last night in
getting the Washington Volun
teers on board of case* to
move on Morong, but the boats
stuck in the mud and failed to
move, but finally reached Mo
rong at daylight. It is thought
that the garrison of Taytay and
Cainto have retreated to Morong
peninsula, where it is hoped to
catch them before Hall's and
Wholley's columns.
â¢From Antipolo. to Taytay the
roads are impassable for wagons.
Lawton burned wagons and artil
lery ammunition rather than let
them fall into the hands of the
enemy.

Covadonga and Coste are in a position

The original plan was to surround the
forces of General li,, del Pilar so that
he must retreat to the Morong penin
sula, where rapture would have been
inevitable. This was not a complete
success, because General Hull's column
found the country full of handicaps to
marching. There were several streams
to be bridged or forded and troops fre
tly foundered through morasses,
waist deep in mud, an experience which,
under the terrific sun, exhausted the
ricans quite beyond endurance.
Most of General I'io del I'Uar's follow
ers are supposed to have escaped north

stronghold la the mountains.

Pasig, where last night about midnight
the men embarked upon cascoes find
started for their destination under con
vex of the gunboats.
They encountered a repetition of the
experience undergone by almost every
expedition in attempting to enter La
guna ('!'â  Bai, as the boats went aground
in the shallows at the mouth of the
river and were detained there several
hours.
Major General I,awton in the mean
time was indefatigable, riding from one
force to the other, and supervising the
loading of the cascoes, without sleep for
two nights.
General HalTs column, which assem
bled at the water works, or pumping
station, late Friday night, under cover
of a moonless sky, consists of the Sec
ond Oregon Volunteers, who marched
to the point of rendezvous from the city
barracks, a battalion >>f the Second
Wyoming Kigirnent, four troops of the
Fourth Cavalry â one mounted on the
big American horses which so im
pr< ssed the natives, the others un
mounted â two battalions of the Fourth
Infantry, one battalion of the Ninth
Infantry and six companies of the First
Colorado Regiment, and two mountain
guns. The men rolled themselves in
their blankets and lay upon the wet
grass for a few hours under a drizzzling
rain.
At 4 o'clock yesterday morning they
began to cross the San Mateo River
and about noon easily repulsed a large
band of Filipinos about twelve miles
east of Manila, between Mariquina and
Antipolo.
The Oregon Regiment, the cavalry,
the artillery and the Fourth Infantry
accomplished this task, driving the In
surgents from the hills, the crther
troops being held in reserve, but after
ward joining the main column in the
pursuit toward the sea.
A running tight was in progress all
the afternoon. A Filipino outpost first
attacked a few American scouts, where
upon the Fourth Cavalry formed a long
skirmish line and easily drove the in
surgents from the hills. Then the Ore
gon Regiment moved across a wet,
soggy rice field in extended order
toward the hills, where it was believed
a large force of the enemy had concen
trated. When the Oregonians were
within about a mile of the potation the
Filipinos opened a heavy fire, thf Amer
icans replying and pressing forward
more rapidly.
After a few volleys the insurgents
were seen scattering over the crest of
the hills in every direction, and their
panic was increased when the artillery
opened upon them and the shells began
to explode all around them, undoubted
ly causing great loss of life. The bom
bardment by the batteries and the mus
ketry was maintained for nearly half
an hour, after which not a Filipino

[came from the position.
The heat was intense and the troops
suffered greatly, but they continued on
the trail taken by the fleeing enemy in
the hope of driving them toward the
lake.
Colonel Wholley, with two battalions
of the First Washington, a battalion
of the Twelfth Infantry, two guns of

ORDERED
TO BRING
DREYFUS
French Cruiser Sfax Will
Return With the Prisoner
of Eevils Island.
RESTORED TO RINK
The Persecuted Capiain to Occupy
an Officer's Cabin and Enjoy
Other Privileges.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PARIS, June 4.â The Cabinet Coun
cil this morning decided that the
French second-class cruiser Sfax,
now at Fort de France, Marti
nique, should proceed immediately
ami bring Dreyfus from the Isle of
Devils to France. The cruiser is ex
pected to arrive at Brest about June 26,
whin Dreyfus will be handed to the
military authorities and lodged in the
military prison at Rennes.
His conviction having been annulled
by the united chambers of the Court of
Cassation, his military rank and title
are restored to him. He will occupy an
officer's cabin on board the Sfax and
will be allowed on deck from 1 to 4
o'clock every afternoon.
The papers point out that the Court
of Cassation voted unanimously for re
vision, and only debated the process
whereby it should be carried out.
The decree of th.- court was communi
cated to Madame Dreyfus at the house
of M. Hadamard, her father. She im
mediately sent the following dispatch to
her husband:
"The Court of Cassation proclaims re
vision, with a new trial by court-mar
tial. Our hearts and thoughts are with
you. Let us share your immense happi
ness. Tenderest kiss from all."
The Figaro says that throughout the
day congratulatory telegrams have
been flowing in upon Madame Dreyfus,
M. Mathieu Dreyfus and Maitre de Mor
nard, their counsel.
Lieutenant Colonel Picquart. on being
informed Of the court's decision said,
"There is nothing better to be hoped
for."
All the revisionist papers atvlairn the
decision as the triumph of truth, jus-
I tice and law and expresses the hope
that all France and all right-minded
men will bow before the decree. They j
are appealing for reconciliation and j
calmness.
The anti-revisionist papers consider
the duty of all to submit, in order to .
j restore peace to the country. A few of
them affect to "wait with confidence the
verdict of thÂ»' new court-martial," im
plying that this will be another con
demnation.
The Rappel publishes a letter from
I M. Herve de Kerohant. asking it to
i open a subscription in order to offer a
! testimonial of sympathy to Madame
Dreyfus, who has suffered and strug
gled, never despairing of justice.
PARAMARIBO, June 4.â The steam
er Ville de Tanger, which passed here
on May 27 on her way to Cayenne with
seventeen Civil Guards to escort Drey
fus back to France, returned here to
day, bound for Martinique. All efforts
of especial means adopted to determine
whether Dreyfus was on board proved
futile. It is reported from Cayenne that
I special army transports have been dis
patched. The escort for Dreyfus re
mained at Cayenne. The report of the
Court of Cassation was still unknown at
Cayenne, and intense excitement pre
vailed there.
GRAY WAS PLACED
ABOVE THE BLUE
COLUMBUS, Ohio. June 4.â The Grand
Army posts of Columbus, Ohio, re
ceived considerable notoriety last week
on account of having- refused to re
ceive a floral tribute from ex-Con
federates of the South to place on
Union praves. The floral committee
which, rejected the emblem has prepared
a statement explaining the matter. The
report says:
The committee feels that It Is due the mem
bers of the Grand Army of Columbus that they
give their reaÃons for rejecting the emblem.
The person in whose mind the design nf that
emblem originated has, by his statements.
placed the committee in a false attitude so far
us rejecting the emblem is concerned.
The chairman of the committee. In accepting
the wreath, did not know what entered Into
the formation of the emblem. When it was
learned that the design contained the emblem
of the American Bag, supported by an arm
Clothed In the Confederate gray above an arm
clothed In blue beneath, many members of the
Grand Army <>f the Republic entered their
protest! against the placing of the emblem
upon the mound, in language that could not be
misunderstood.
In regard to the objectionable features of the
rmtilein. the gray arm being placed not only
above the blue, but on the emblem at all, was
the only objection to accepting the emblem.
WOMAN BANDIT
RESISTS ARREST
PHOENIX. Ariz., June 4.â The
robbers, who held up the Globe
and Florence stage last Tues
day, were captured by Sheriff
Truman of Pino County, near
Benson, yesterday afternoon.
One of them, a woman named
Pearl Hart, made a strong fight.
Both were asleep with their
guns beside them. All the
money â about $350â the revolv
ers and a gold watch, taken
from passengers of the stage,
were recovered. The woman
was the keeper of a resort here
for several years. She has been
living at Globe. Her companion
is a stranger.
PRESIDENT LOUBET
PUBLICLY ASSAILED
THREE OF THE CHIEF ENEMIES OF DREYFUS
As chiefs of the general staff of the French army they are accused of prostituting honor and duty as men
and soldiers, even to perjuring themselves on the witness stand to perpetuate Dreyfus' disgrace and imprison
ment, and punish the advocates of his Innocence.
These officers, with General Mereier, Minister of War, and M. Dupuy, Prime Minister in 1594, when Drey
fus was first accused and convicted, are now, by general demand, about to be placed on trial themselves, for the
crimes instigated and committed by them in the several farces called trials that have grown out of the case
besides being liable for damages.
PARIS, June 4,â President Loubet,
accompanied by the Premier, M.
Dupuy, and the chief of the mili
tary household, General Bal
loud, drove tn the Auteuil races
this afternoon, closely followed by
Mme. Loubet in a second landau. As
they drove along the Avenue dcs
Champs Elysee the crowd bowed re
spectfully; but on arriving at Auteuil,
they were met by a violent demonstra
tion, evidently organized and directed
against the President.
There was a storm of hoots, yells and
cries of "Panama," "A Has Loubet,"
And "Vive l'Armee." A few shouts of
â Vive Louhet," were drowned in the
clamor.
A strong force of police kept order
and arrested many of the disturbers,
including a man who tried to force his
way to the President's carria&e.
During the second race, the clamor
increased to violence and was plainly
directed by a committee of the League
of Patriots, collected with their sup
porters, both before and behind the
Presidential stand, around which a
formidable affray proceeded.
During the grand steeplechase many
blows were struck and several police
were injured in their endeavors to pre
vent an invasion of the Presidential
stand.
At the crisis of the excitement, while
shouts of "Vive l'Armee" and "Vive
Derpulede," were heard on all sirtes, |
Count Christiani rushed toward the
President, brandishing a stick and di
rected a blow against him, striking his
hat. The crowd rushed upon Christiani.
who only escaped severe handling by
being taken under police protection.
President Loubet remained all the
while quite unmoved, talking to the
Premier, while the officers of his mili
tary household were defending him
against violence.
Finally, after thirty arrests had been
made, the prefect of police ordered the
Republican Guards to surround the
Presidential stand. The principal lead
ers of the demonstration were M. Jos
eph Lasies, anti-Semite and Nationalist
deputy for Gers. and M. Fennin Faure,
anti-Semite and Nationalist deputy for
Oran, Algeria.
Police Inspector Grilliere had his head
seriously wounded in the melee, and
President Loubet has since decorated
him with the cross of the Legion of
Honor in recognition of his devotion to
duty.
On returning to the Elysee Palace, M.
Loubet received many sympathizing
callers.
It seems certain that the demonstra
tion was organized by the Jeunesse
Royaliste, the Ligue dcs Patriotes and
the anti-Semites, the rallying signal
being a carnation in the buttonhole.
Count Christiani is a member of the
steeplechase society, a very select body,
and his conduct has produced the
greatest indignation.
A special meeting of the Council was
! summoned at 9 o'clock tms evening to
consider the situation and important
measures were concerted, to be submit
ted to the President at another council
to-morrow, for the preservation of or
der. The Ministers, who were in ses
sion until 11 o'clock, maintain strict re
serve as to the nature of the measures,
but a semi-official note has been issued,
which says:
"The Government will act with the
greatest energy and will impose respect
for the President and for the State."
It is reported that a number of fresh
arrests will be made to-morrow morn
ing.
The events of the day will tend to an
important discussion in the Chamber of I
Deputies, where the Government will
demand a vote of confidence. There is I
some fear of a renewal of the disturb
ance, although the police precautions
are of the most thorough character. At
a late hour this evening more or less
excitement is still observable on the
boulevards.
Further accounts show that the whole
race course, particularly the enclosure,
witnessed scenes of the wildest excite
ment.
Comtosse Boni de Castellane, who
was Miss Anna Gould of New York
City, placed herself at the head of the
Jeunesse Royaliste and marched up and
down the lawn shouting, "Vive
l'Armep."
Comte Ronl de Castellane and his |
brother, Jean, were arrested, but soon
liberated.
Comte de Dion, when arrested, resist
ed and fought with his cane, smashing !
it on a policeman's head and causing
the jeweled top to fly off, striking a j
journalist. He was detained in custody.
Altogether ' about 130 arrests vere
made, one being that of M. Dalsette,
Deputy Mayor of Armentieres.
Demonstrations and counter-demon
strations continued until M. Loubet left i
the race course, at 4:20 p. m., the ar
rival of his carriage being the signal
for an indescribable tumult. The I
mounted guards with difficulty opened j
a passage through the crowd, the Presi- !
dent being pursued to the last with
hoots and yells. Even eggs were !
thrown.
It was noteworthy, however, that the
people generally cheered him loudly, j
the cheers increasing as he drove |
RIOTERS HOPED THAT
LOUBET WOULD BE SLAIN
Copyrighted, 1599, by the Associated Press.
PARIS. June 4. â It was a premeditated riot that took place to-day
on the weighing ground of the Auteuil race course. The object of the
rioters was to insult President Loubet, and, perhaps, in the heat of fac
tion and fight, to get rid of him. The state tribune' was invaded by a
number of swells. One of them, Baron Christiani, raised his cane to strike
the President with all his might. The blow was averted by General Bal
loud, and the cane, descending on M. Loubet's hat, crushed it down, forc
ing it over his face like a candle extinguisher.
Madame Balloud fainted. Christiani was beaten black and blue by
the gentlemen around the President and was carried away by six police
men, he kicking and plunging and the blood spurting from his nose.
One hundred and thirty arrests were made in the weighing grounds.
Most of those taken up were society gentlemen.
M. Loubet had been forewarned of a plot to insult and assail him
and instead of driving to the races with his wife, he drove with the
Premier, M. Dupuy and General Balloud, Mmc Loubet following him with
two ladies in another carriage.
The news that Major Marchand had been sent from Paris, annoyed
the crowds, but the common people were decently behaved all the way
to the race course: and it was only when the Presidential carriage en
tered the weighing ground that the row began.
Comte de Dion gave the signal in front of the Presidential tribune.
He was promptly arrested, but his arrest served as an excuse to his
friends to cry. "Down with Panama," "Resign," "Down with traitors,
Jews and Dreyfusites."
The windows on the ground floor of the Presidential tribune were
broken and several ladies in the President's party upstairs fainted.
After the first race, M. Loubet, pale and greatly cut up, but firm, re
tired. A large body of police and members of the Republican Guard had
work in protecting him, and the President finally took his carriage out
of the enclosure by an uncrowded by-way.
Riotous fellows, posted in groups along the way to the Elysee, kept
on insulting the President.
Madame Loubet remained to the end of the races. She burst into
tears on learning by telephone that her husband was safe back in the
palace.
A stormy sitting is expected to-morrow in the Chamber of Deputies.

safely at 4:45 p. m. During the demon
strations a number of hats labeled
"Resignation" were picked up.
<7omte Christiani was thrown down,
trampled upon and severely bruised in
the melee. He is a grandson of a gen
| eral who was well known during the
Empire. It seems it was intended to
give the Marchand mission a big ova
tion. The Government got wind of the
affair and kept Marchand out of the
way. although Captain Barratiere and
the other members of the expedition
! were there. The Derouledists, balked of
their opportunity, evidently vented
their spite upon the President.
The race course committee apologized
to M. Loubet, who replied that he could
not think of holding them responsible.
He remarked to an important person
age that he did not intend being intimi
dated into resignation.
During the demonstrations. M.
; Rochefort, editor of l'lntransigeant,
j was seen and an attempt was made to
induce him to lead the manifestation,
but he discreetly slipped away.
Most of the persons arrested repre
sent some of the best families in
France. Comte Christiani is held on a
i charge of attempting to strike the Pres
ident. Comte d'Aubigny d'Assay is
charged with wounding Police Inspec
tor Grilliere, and another policeman.
Among those now in custody are: MM.
de Clermont Honnerre, De Remuzat, De

scarcely less prominent were arrested.

Awhile.
INSULAR COMMISSION'S PLAN
GRADUAL EXTENSION OF HOME
RULE PROPOSED.
Spanish System of Taxation Is Al
tered and All Revenues Are De
voted to Public Im
provements.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, June 4.â The Washing
ton correspondent of the Herald tele
graphs: "By direction of the President
the insular Commission, which submit
t. d irs report a few days ago. is devis
ing a sch< me of municipal government
for Porto Rico and a new system of
taxation for the island. A member of
commission with whom I talked to-day
told mi' that, judging from his observa
tion of the inhabitants of I'orto Rico,
they were not fit yet for self-govern
ment.
"Porto Rico," he said, "should be
come to the United States what
Canada is to Great Britain. There
are sixty-eight municipalities on the
island. It seems to me a good way to
commence the extension of self-govern
meni would lie to take two of the more
Important of the municipalities and
Mayaguese and under a system of suf
. with an educational test, permit
them to govern themselves, if the plan
worked satisfactorily, extend the sys
tem to the other. In five years the peo
ple "t the island would be prepared to
govern it.
"There is no danger that they will
revolt against the authority "f the
I'iiii. d States. A small military force
should be retained on the island, but
more for mere effect than because of
actual need of its presence.
Major General Henry tried to modify
the Spanish system of taxation by
grafting on it some American ideas, but
his plan is not working satisfactorily
and th" President desires that an en
tirely new American plan may supplant
the system now in operation.
The commission is taking the best
American laws and will include them in
the system to he recommenced. At
present taxes are applied upon the
amount of produce that ought to be
grown on a determined seetlon of land.
In some cases where the owner is giv
ing th" land a rest, the application of
ill.- tax is in the nature of ;t hardship.
The commission proposes to tax land
equ illy, as is .lone in the United States.
M\ money raised by taxation in {'"rt"
Rico will be devoted t>> improvement .if
the island. There is no intention on the
part "f the Government to divert the
funds so raised to national uses.
The commission expects to complete
it< work the latter part of tin's month,
when it will adjourn sine die.
INDIAN CATTLE THIEF
FLOGGED TO DEATH
Tied co a Stake by His Tribesmen and
Lashed Until Life Is
Extinct.
GI'THRIE. O. T.. June 4.â There was
much â¢ xdtement among the Indians at
Sans Bois, 1. T., yesterday, when at dusk
John Mays, a Choctaw, was publicly
flogged to death.
The punishment inflicted on Mays was
for cattle stealing and was in accordance
with an old Choctaw law. which provides
for the giving of 100 lashes on the bare
back of any member of the tribe found
guilty of cattle stealing. If an Indian
withstands the severe puniflMhent meted
i him in 100 lashes he is given free
dom, but few have lived through half
this punishment.
When the fiftieth stroke was applied
Mays made frantic efforts to wrench him
self from the post, blood fairly pouring
from the Btreaks of tlesh on his back.
As the seventieth lash was given he col
lapsed and lay limp at the stake. He was
unconscious at the eightieth stroke, and
at the eighty-sixth it was found he was
dead.

Tip se lights art usually very tame af
falrs, but to-day the Mexican love of gore
was satlstied. The bulls for to-day's tight
were brought from the Samalayuca

tremely ferocious.
American women in the audience turned
away from the ghastly spectacle, and
many fainted. The Mexican side of the
ring was in an uproar of cheers and cries
of "Viva toro," presenting a scene
worthy of the days of Xero.

One Hundred and Fifty Animals Dy-
ing of Starvation and Thirst
Near Stockton.
STOCKTON. June 4.â On Roberts
Island, just opposite Black Slough. ISO
cattle have mired in the sticky mud and
are slowly dying of starvation and thirst.
The cattle were landed from a barge on
Friday, and were en route to Merced. As
sistance was sent down to-day, and it was
hoped most of the stock could be saved,
but persons familiar with the task doubt
that the cattle can be extricated. Miller
& Lux recently lost a lot of cattle near
Head ranch in the same manner,
"When the cattle are mired it is hard to
get a foundation in the mud from which
enough hoisting power may be operated.
Tho band of cattle helpless in the mud
make a pitiful picture, and the authori
ties will urge that, if they cannot be
got out, they be killed to put an end to
their sufferings.

HILLSBRO, N. M.. June 4.-Captain
George Curry, former Sheriff or Lincoln
County, has arrived and disclosed infor
mation that has been heretofore well
I guarded concerning a conspiracy to com
mit four murders, one of them being that
of Colonel Fountain. He does not impli
cate Lee and Gilllland, who arc now being
tried for the murder of Colonel Fountain
and his son, but simply Bald:
"If the court will admit my evidence I
, can tell who planned the killing and who
vainly lay In wan for Colonel Fountain
once before he was killed.
" 'Slick' Miller, one of my former pris
oners, who was pardoned out of the peni
tentiary bj Governor Thornton, made a
confession to me which I have kept se
cret, having had no occasion to divulge it
until now. There were three men in the
plot, anil all had been Indicted for steal
ing rattle, j had been instrumental in
prosecuting some of the rases, and
they agreed to put me out of
the way, too. James 11. Cree of
the V. V. Cuttle Company, a largo Scotch
syndicate, was to be killed. I told him
quietly what I knew, and he. fearing he
would yet be murdered, returnee! to Scot
land arid is waiting until this affair is
settled, w. <\ McDonald of the Carrixo
Cattle -Company, another who was active
in prosecuting the cattle thieves, was to
lie murdered, ami also Colonel Fountain,
who was then attorney for the South
tern New Mexico Cattle company.
Miller was convicted of cattle st.-aling
and the other two conspirators carried
out bul a part nt their agreement."
Curry said that Miller told him that the
bullies of Colonel Fountain and his son
wen burled in the White Sands near the
Sacramento mountains. A thorough
starch of these sands may disclose the
bodies, but it is feared that the drifting
nature of the soil has buried them too
deep.
Curry he-Id a conference with the attor

are they will use him as a witness,.

mfti of the pÂ°sse which left the scene of

the trail of three of the outlaws for about
forty miles; Uien it was lost in a stream.
This morning a sh<-ep herder accidently
ran onto the robbers, who were in camp
In a gulch about six miles west of Cas
j per. One of the robbers pointed a Win
: Chester at him and ordered him to leave.
He reported the incident at Casper, and a
posse of riders with the Sheriffs of Con
verse and Natrona counties started out ti
effect the capture of the outlaws. They
found their trail and are now but three
hours behind.
Tin- capture of the men is looked upon
as C( rtain, as they are hemmed in by
several passes of armed men. Their ob
jective point was evidently the Powder
River country or the Hole-in-the- VY wl
region, places of refuse for criminals.
They are shut out from reaching either

CROSS OF DIAMONDS
FOR AN ARCHBISHOP
THE magnificent pectoral cross worn by Archbishop Corrigan at the ordi
nation at New York recently excited the wonder and admiration of all be
holders. A pectoral cross is the one worn by all the Bishops of the Roman
church, suspended around the neck by a gold chain. They are ordinarily
the best work of goldsmiths, but this one is unusual. Tt is five inches long,
of purest gold and blazes with diamonds. In the arms are seven large brilliants
surrounded by clusters of smaller ones.
It is said to have cost $20,000, and to have be^n made of the jewels of the late
Mrs Eugene Kelly. She directed that the gems should be so used. Neither the
Archbishop nor any .of his seretaries Â«ould talk on the subject. They say simply
it is the gift of a friend.

Chagrin of Captain Edgar Over the

Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN QUENTIN PRISON. June 4.â
Warden Hale has at last found the exam
ple set by the worm consoling, also to
the recipient of a gold brick, and accord
ingly has turned on his tormentor, Gov
ernor Gage. It took the WardeÂ» a good
deal longer than it did the general public
to discover that he had been "fooled."
which migtit have been due to the tact
that the general public, being entirely
dislntertst-'d. had the Governor pretty
well "sized up" long before the late Leg
islature adjourned. But sad experience has
at last pulled the wool from Mr. Hale's
eyes, and the proverbial wet hen is not in
it with him for indignation.
Hale made a hard fight to retain his po
sition as the head of the prison, but when
Director Fitzgerald was whipped into the
line marked down by the Burns-Gage duo
and Director Hayes concluded that a res
ignation would be hasty and not render
Half any matt-rial assistance, the Warden j
threw up hi,s hands and quit the game.
Not all hope died in his breast, however,
for only a short time later he visted Gage
and was set at work studying French
preparatory to being appointed one of the
State Commissioners to the Paris Exposi
tion.
Gage thought this so good a joke that
he used to recount it with gusto both at i
clubs and at private dinners. The "joke" \
reached The Call, and Hale was warned !
that he was "up against it," but his trust
did not waver. When the three appoint
ments were finally made public the War
den was dumfounded, but his anger soon !
caused him to study how to "get even." j
He has found a way by snubbing the new
Warden.
It was agreed at the last meeting of
the Prison Directors here that Hale
should take Aguirre in hand and make
him acquainted with the inner workings
of the prison a month before he took the
position. Now Hale refused to do this,
arid haÂ« notified Gage that he is not hired
by the State to "break in new Wardens."
A congratulatory telegram sent Aguirre ;
by Hale stated that if the latter would
visit San Quentln a few days before he
took charge he would be coached as re
gards his duties. This message was a sur
prise to Aguirre and the first intimation
Gage had of Hale sulking.
J. C. Edgar has developed a strong de
sire to retain his position as captain of
the yard on account of his enmity for
Captain of the Guards Birlem, but the in
dications are that he will have to go. To
add to his wrath, it is probable Captain
Birlem will receive the positioin Edgar
now holds on account of the favorite's
greater experience, in order to make room
for Under Sheriff McClure of Ix>s Ange
les, whom Aguirre will bring with him to
the prison. As McClure has resigned a
$200 position, it is evident that one of the
captaincies is meant for him.
RECLAIMING TULE LANDS.
Thousands of Acres of Marsh Tracts
Brought Under Cultivation.
STOCKTON. June 4.â The dredgers
Staten Island and Golden Gate will this
week commence the reclamation of 2300
acres of marsh and lule lands between
Old and Middle rivers. The work is to
be done for O. Y. Woodward, who already
has large holdings on the islands. The
dredgers will have nearly eleven miles
of levee to build on account of the cir
cuitous lines of the river. â¢
It is expected that by Tuesday work will
have been finished on the 5000-acre tract
northwest of Tracy, known as the Bell-
Fabian land. The reclamation has been
done by Frank Bell on shares, and ..e
used the big Empire dredger.
The progress made on reclamation work
the last two years would indicate, that
not many more years .will pass before all
the. lands (Will- have boon brought un

OBSERVE COMMUNION
In Her Annual Message Mrs,
Eddy Forsees Great Danger
/ Threatening the Nation,
Special Dispatch to The Call.
I reluctantly foresee great
danger threatening our na
tion â imperialism, monopoly
and a lax system of religion.
But the spirit of humanity,
ethics and Christianity sown
broadcast â all concomitants cf
Christian Science â is taking
strong hold of the pub
lic thought throughout our
beloved country and in
foreign lands, and is tending
to counteract the trend of mad
ambition. â From the annual
message of Mary Baker Eddy,
Pastor Emeritus of the First
Church of Christian Science at
Boston.
BOSTON. June 4.â The followers of
Christian Science to-day observed
Communion day with four largely
attended services at the mother
church, the First Church of Christian
Science in this city. Thousands flocked
into the edifice merely^ for the privilege
of kneeling in silent communion or listen-
Ing to the reading of a brief message and
the exchange of kindly greetings with fel
low-members. As fast as the services
â¢were concluded and the congregation had
departed another great concourse
streamed into the church and the simple
service was repeated.
Each gathering was a representative
one, for all sorts of men and women were
present. Even the knowledge that the
leader. Mrs. Eddy, would not be present
had little effect on those who joined In the
services, and her message, full of love and
peace, was received with silent thankful-
Ilt SS.
Septimus J. Hanna Invited those pres
ent to join in the communion. His words
of invitation were: "I now invite all
present, whether members of this church
or not. and communicants of other
churches, II there be any present; to enter
with us into the inner sanctuary of Saul
for a brief moment, into the holy of ho
lies, into the secret places of the most
high; for there is nothing as near as in
iinito love."
After the silent prayer the annual mes
sage of the Pastor Emeritus; Mar;. Baker
Eddy; to the mother church, was read
by John Reeder and listened to with great
interest.
Excerpts from Mrs. Eddy's message fol
low:

I have only to dip my pen in my heart to say
all honor to the members of thÂ« the board of

Loyal to the divine principle they so ably
vindicate, they earn their laurete; history will
record their words, and their works will fol

felt the touch of the spirit of the Mars Hill
orator, which always thrills the soul. I have
the great pleasure to report that within the
i last month there have been aided to this board
j the talent, influence and eirxerience of the
distinguished Hon. W. 1... Swing of Chicago
j and Judgu J. R. Clarkaon of Omaha, Ne.br.
The members of the board of education, under
! the auspices of the Massachusetts Metaphysi
i cal College, have acquittted themselves nobly.
The students In my last class In IS9S are stars
I in my crown of rejoicing.
We thank the River of all good for the mar
! velous speed of the chariot wheels of truth
i and for the steadfast, calm coherence in the
I rnnks of Christian Science On comparison It
i will be found that Christian Science pos
! sesses more of Christ's teaching and example
: than all other religions since the first cen
; t :r> Comparing our Bo}entflc system of
; metaphysical therapeutics with materla medico,
j we find It completely overshadows and over-
I whelms it. even as Aaron's rod swallowed up
i the rods of the magician* of Egypt. I â¢Ipliber-
I ately declare that when I was in practice, out
; of 100 cases I healed ninety-nine to the ten

i the nineteenth century. A siege of, combined

' tian Science, garrison jd by God's chosen ones.

I Board of Health or class legislation i.Â« less

' find infinitely less tban God's benign govern
f ment, which is no respecter of persons. Truth

"Where the spirit of the Lord is. there is
; liberty." God is everywhere, nor crown, nor
I scepter, nor ruler* rampant can quench the
â  vital heritage of freedom- man's right to
; adopt a religion, to employ a physical!, to live
i or to <ile according t.i the dictates of his own
â  rational conscience and enlighten under

Christian Scientists abide by the laws of God

CELEBRATES HIS BIRTHDAY

REACHED.
He Announces His Weight at 158
Pounds, While Jeffries Will En

Friday Night.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, June 4.â "80b" Fitzsim- j
mans did not go to church to-day, but he
i respected the Sabbath, as he always does
' when training for a glove contest. He
rested. His exercise consisted of reading,
| playing with his children, a bath for him
| self and pony in the bay, a short walk, a
i drive with his wife and an afternoon nap
of three hours.
When seen In the afternoon he had just
awakened from his three-hour sleep. He I
did not appear as though his dreams had j
I troubled him. He sprang from his bed
I like a two-year-old, and his first remark j
i was:
"1 am thirty-seven years old to-day."
j . One could not help but remark that he
i was in a most healthy condition. His
skin is slightly tanned, but he has that
healthy, ruddy glow underneath the tan
that always marks good condition. No
i mistake can be made by saying that he
j Is in even better condition than he was at
I Carson City two years ago.
"Fitz" is carrying a slight cut on the
bridge of his nose, where it came in con
tact with Kenney'e cheekbone during Sat
urday's work. The nose is swollen some- j
what, but compared with the cut on Ken-
I ney's eye it is but a scratch, for Kenney <
| has a cut under the eyebrow that is as i
I zigzag as a streak of lightning.
â¢1 thought my nose was broken," said
"Bob," "'wnen we struck each other. It j
v, .is purely an accident and happened in a I
! cllncn. Poor Jvenneyâ he reeled around :
like a decapitated chicken. My nose must |
be very hard to stand such a crash and ,
inflict "the wound it did on Kenney. He \
1 has not shown up since it happened, but 1 ;
hope he does, lor he is a good man to i
I work with." â  ' : â¢
, In speaKing of his intentions during the. !
I fight, ne saiu he would try to win as soon i
I as possible.
! â â¢ii i can settle the affair in one round
! I shall do so. Ihe pictures do not concern
! me a little bit, tor there is no money in
! them. Julian and Brady were given an
1 exhibition of the light on Saturday nignt
j in the Manhattan 1 neater, and they crura
that good pictures can be taken, but there
i will not be much of a picture if 1 can put.
an nd to Jeffries in the early moments of
I me contest."
â  As !â¢ itzsimmons was pulling his waist \
! belt around him he called attention to the ,
; , tact that he nad lost about twelve pounds j
"1 was at 17u pounds before i started
I training," said he, "and now 1 weigh
': i about 108. You see 1 have taken up four
1 holes in my waist belt."
Compared with the character of work
! that he has performed since he began to j
, get into shape for the big battle. Jeffries' i
exercise at his training quarters in As- I
bury Park to-day was rather mild. In- I
Stead of working hard at several forms |
of athletic exercise morning and after- |
; noon, as has been his custom since he j
: began training. Jeffries confined his work i
i to the forenoon and took things easy in !
| the afternoon, going out for a long drive
| around the country. -. .}-.
--', His forenoon was by no means dull. The
I big boiiermaker started the day by work
; ing the wrist machine and pulling weights
; for a half hour. This exercise over, Jef
i fries immediately went for a road run, !
I accompanied by his brother "Jack" and
I "Tommy" Ryan. Ross O'Neill, mounted
! on a bicycle, acted as pacemaker for the
j party. The course Selected for the run
: was from the training "quarters to Holly
j wood and return. The pace on the out- ,
i ward journey was very mild, Jeffries
! merely jogging along, but on the return
i trip racing speed was maintained. Jef
| fries finished good and strong.
Thu big fellow immediately after the ;
run visited the gymnasium and tossed :
: the medicine ball about for twenty min
utes, finishing with skipping the rope 1200
times. At tne conclusion of the latter
exercise Jeffries received a rubbing down ,
and then read the morning papers. After
dinner he "loafed" around for a while
and chatted with some visitors, going for
i a drive with Ryan at 2:30 o'clock.
Jeffries said his work in the future;
i would be rather easy. He would work
if he felt like it, otherwise he would not. j
"You see," said the boilermaker, "I am ]
' now as fit as it Is possible for me to me. !
1 I am down to the weight I made up my
! mind to reachâ 2o4 poundsâ and there is j
| not an ounce of superfluous flesh on my
â  body. I am very strong and never felt
better in my life. If I continue violent
! exercise longer it might do me more â 
I harm than good. I will take things very
1 easy until Friday night, when 1 go Into
the" ring with Fitz.'.'
"Mike" Donovan, coaching instructor
I for the New York Athletic Club, was
! among the Jeffries visitors to-day. He j
i intended to spar several rounds with the
j Californlan during the afternoon, but as
jeffrlfs decided to go driving, Donovan
1 agreed to remain at Asbury over night
1 and don the gloves with the big fellow
| to-morrow.
FAMILY OF THE FUTURE
SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE
NEW YORK, June 4.â A Washington*
Bpecial to the Herald says: As Represent

i ens to make a runaway race of the con
: test for the Speakership, the bright light i
: of public Interest will be focused on his !
family and the part it may play in the ;
social world of the- national capital. .
The wife of the. Speaker of the House !
is entitled to a high social position in j
Washington, but if Mrs. Henderson j
achieves social prominence in the. event of
1 her husband becoming Speaker she will do
What Mrs. Heed, Mrs. fri.Â«p, Mrs. Car
lisle and Mrs. Blalne failed to do whila j
: their husbands held office. Widely known
as arc t lie last two names, their social i
fanv was not established until their hus
bands became members of the Cabinet.
Mr Henderson Is partial to. social fes
tivities, and he is a welcome guest at any
dinner table or social function. Good din- |
nera and card parties are his favorite ]
forms of amusement, and nothing; would
please him better than that his wife and
daughter should show a fondness for sim
ilar pleasures, combined with a genuine |
weakness for afternoon teas and recep

Mrs. Henderson is a woman of small
Stature and youthful appearance. Whr-n
surprise is expressed by her new-made i
acquaintances that she has a married
daughter and grandchildren. Mrs. Hen

daughter was prematurely married."
Guard McDonald Recovers.
SAN QUENTTN PRISON, June <.â
Guard James McDonald, who was stabbed
by Convict Jacob Oppenhelmer on May IC,
has recovered from his wounds so rapidly j
that he was able to leave the hospital and j
visit his family this morning. The fact
that the guard is yet alive is due In pre:tt j
measure to the diligence exercised by i
Director James 11. Wllkins in engaging â¢
th.- services of a trained nurse. A pris
oner named David Hill was a valuable j
assistant of Dr. Lawlor in raring for the
wounded man. Dr. I,awlor himself visited i
the sufferer no less than 110 times before
McDonald was permitted to visit his fam '
ily. The joy or the wife and children of
the man who for a week hovered on the
brink of the grave was touching.

CONNEMARA MET PRONOUNCED i
DEFEAT WITH LUXOR.
Shortenders Pulled Down Money at
All Stages of the Game.
Hares Run Like
Demons.
Forget created a sensation at T'nion
Coursing Park yesterday. The clever
hound worked Its way through the final
and took the stake, while only a few of
the venturesome had money on it In the
"long odds" end of the betting, where
pools sold yesterday at something like 1
to 2,">. Connemara, Luxor, Lowlander,
Mac's Melody and plenty of other stake
winners were on the card, but it seemed
a day for surprises and upsets and they
all went down at one stage or another
of the game.
The second round of the open stake
contained ten short-enders and the talent
tumbled down fearfully. In the fifth
round Connemara, which was predicted as
the stake-winner, fell down before Luxor,
and in the next course Luxor met de
feat in a chase with Maori Land. The
fraternity went wild, as Connemara was
a 1 to 1 favorite, and Luxor, in the fol
lowing run, was a 3 to 1 favorite. For
get, who had put out Quick Stitch in the
iifth round and slipped along with a bye
in the sixth, went to slips in the final
with Ma^ri Land and captured the lirst
money.
The hares were spry and enduring.
Some of the chases were extremely seji
satiqnal and afforded much amusement
to the spectators. Grenada and Belle
Claire followed the rabbit for over three
minutes, and when the latter came to
meet Maori Land she had to be with
drawn. O X Capitol and Crawford had

Speed was shown by many of the dogs,
and alto-ether the day's sport was rated

Luxor led Connemara and stood his
ground well. At one time Dean's dog was

WAR IS NOW RAGING
ON TELEGRAPH HILL
The Crofton and Badaracco Famihes
Enter Into a Bitter Feud.
TUX peace and quiet of Telegraph Hill are things of tho past. The hill
district has been rudely disturbed, and deadly guerrilla warfare now
strikes terror deep Into the hearts nf the residents thereof. The trouble
began early yesterday morning, and before the fogs of the afternoon
had settled upon the hill, two families that have for these many years
been upon the friendliest of terms had been estranged. As it now
stands, the houses of Badaracco and Crofton have swYirn a deep vengeance
against each other. They have buried the pipe and dug up the hatchet, and
from tho present indications the famous feud of the McCoys and Hatflelds
of Kentucky will be regarded as child's play compared to this.
The first inkling of trouble on Telegraph Hill came to the surface yester
day morning, when "Jimmy" Crofton walked into the Harbor Hospital and
announced that he had been shot hy another boy on Telegraph Hill, whose
name he refused to toll. Dr. H. O. yon der I.ieth made an examination of
Jimmy's injuries. He found two nails in his right arm. Jimmy said that
his enemy had loaded his pistol with blank cartridges, and had then put a
nail in the pistol and tired at him. The doctor removed the nails and dressed
the arm, and all during the operation Jimmy was swearing vengeance
against his assailant. He said that a few days ago he borrowed a nickel
from the other boy. which he was to have returned yesterday. He acknowl
edged the justness of the debt, but declared that when the young Shylock ac
costed him yesterday and demanded the return of the loan, that he was un
able to comply with his request, whereupon the money-lender blazed away at
him twice, both shots taking effect.
Jimmy had departed from the hospital about an hour or so. when Benja
min Badaracco. a citizen of sunny Italy, appeared upon the scone, bringing
with him his son, Paul. Paul. too. had been in a fracas. He had not been
defending his country, but he had been shot, for the side of his face re
sembled the top of a tin pepper box Paul's would-be destroyer was
"Tommy" Crofton. a brother of Jimmy. When Tommy learned that his
brother had been wounded he went on the warpath on general principles. He
declared that he had to shoot somebody just to avenge Jimmy. The first
person he met was Paul, and he fired at short range. Paul's father would
not let the doctor dress his son's face because he said that he was going
to get out a warrant to-day, and he wanted the judge to see the powder
marks.
An Investigation into the state of affairs on Telegraph Hill yesterday
revealed the fact that the small boys were divided Into two factions, one
headed by the Croftons and the other by the Badaraecos. All of the boys
seemed to be well supplied with pistols. Their ammunition consisted of
blank cartridges, but they made these effective by putting nails and gravel
Into their weapons. They were blazing away at each other, and it was
worthy of note ihat Paul and Jimmy were doing good valiant work.
Neither side had gained any advantage when darkness put an end to the
fight. Jimmy said that war had been declared because Paul Badaracco had
been shot by his brother. He admitted that he owed a boy a nickel, but he
was wroth over the manner In which that individual had attempted to col
lect the debt. He was honest enough to state that his brother Tom was
not justified in ihootlng Paul In order to avenge him.
All of the young combatants are under twelve years of age. The police
have taken no cognizance of the hostilities, but they are prepared at any
tlme to assail the hill and restore peace.

COURSING AT LOS ANGELES
LOS ANGELES, June 4.â At Agricul

Duty second and Stella R third. The sport
throughout was good and interest sus

WAS KILLED BY A
TRAIN IN MONTANA
William J. Kelly, who was killed by a
train near Mlsscula, Mont., was a resi
dent of thi3 city. His sister's picture
was found In his pocket when the life
less body was picked up.
The young man resided at 14 Natoma
street with his father, sister and
younger brother, and left home last July
to visit St. Louis, Mo., where he was
born. The family is heart-broken over
the affair, especially as the particulars
of his killing are very meager. No fui
ther information has been received at his
home, and the manner of his death is
as yet nuTe conjecture.
Chief of Police Lees received a tele
gram from the Mlssoula authorities for
information as to the dead man's con-

nections. The sister. Miss Kate Kelly,
Visited the City Hall yesterday and was
considerably disappointed at not receiv
ing any information on the matter.
The father, when seen at the home yes
terday afternoon, expressed himself as
much worried over the affair.
"We are at a loss." ho said, "to ac
count for my son's sudden taking off. He
left us in the best of spirits with the in

plumber in St. Louis. Before leaving he
Informed his sister, to whom he was de
votedly attached, that lie was going to
marry a young lady in Keswlck, Shasta
County, bui I do not think he carried
out his intention. He has not communi
cated with us very much since he left,
but his letters were always hopeful. He
was twenty-seven years of age and was
very careful about himself. This care
he exercised to a greater extent ever
since a friend of his, Charles Kilday by
name, was killed a few years ago while
they were both working on a scaffold at
tached to a house at the corner of Geary
and Octavia streets. The scaffold brok'o
and Kilday was hurled head downward
to the ground. That accident made a
deep Impression on my son, and it seems
strange that he should have met with a
similar fatality."
AN OLD COUPLE
DESPOILED BY
PICKPOCKETS
A Bold Gang "Works"
a Picnic Crowd.
WILLIAM DAVIDSON'S LOSS
HE AND HIS WIFE RELIEVED OF
THEIR VALUABLES.
Another Woman Cleverly Touched for
a Diamond Cross â Police Are
Now Looking for the
Thieves.
A prang 1 of pickpockets successfully
"worked" the crowd while attending the
picnic at Schuetzen Park yesterday. At
least a dozen men and women were robbed
b> the light-fingered gentry.
Last evening William Davidson, an
elderly man, and his wife visited police,
headquarters and reported that they had
been relieved of their valuables while re
turning from the picnic. They were
seated in one of the coaches, and when
near the Oakland mole Mr. Davidson
â¢ missed a valuable diamond stud which
adorned his shirt front.
He Quickly informed his wife of his
| loss and started out to find the thief.
I During his temporary absence Mrs.
1 Davidson plated her hand in her dress
â  pocket to got her handkerchief whi n she
: was startled to find that her purse had
; also been taken by one of the pickpockets.
i As soon as her husband returned to his
j seat she excitedly told him of the loss of
â  her valuables. The purse contained a
! valuable Masonic emblem, a diamond
rir.g and $^ in silver.
While the aged couple were bemoaning
their jewelry and money, two other
women complained that they had been
cleverly robbed of their purses. A young
woman, who gave her name as Mrs.
Reynolds, declared that she had been
"touched" for a diamond cross, which she
wore close to her throat. On the return
Of the train to this city. Mrs. Reynolds
hastened to police headquarters, where
she gave a description of the stolen cross
to Captain Bohen.
It is said that a number of other people
were similarly robbed of their purses and
j jewelry by the thieving gang.
The police are Inclined to believe that
â  the pickpockets who lobbed the returning
picnickers belong to the same gang that
j recently attempted to operate at the
Chutes and Golden Gate Park. They were
accompanied by two flashily dressed
young women, who assisted them in their
thieving work.
Last evening Chief Lees was informed
that one of the pang had been arrested in
Oakland. Nothing of an Incriminating
nature was found on him. Detectives
; Egan and Gibson have been instructed to
: round up the gang.
CONEY-NORDMAN WEDDING.
Groom and Bride Well Known in San

The groom is a young dentist, who has
won a position in his profession.
After the ceremony the eighty guests
sat dtfwn to an elaborate wedding dinner.
A musical programme had been pre
pared, the chief feature of which was the
numbers rendered by the Boston Saxo
phone Quartet. Many toasts were offered
to the young couple, speeches and songs
made happy interludes to the numerous
courses and a general jollity prevailed.
The Coneys will leave for the south on

"Willis Schmidt, the 15-year-old boy who
was arrested in the Cafe Royal Saturday
nitrht was taken to Sonoma yesterday,
where he is wanted for stealing 1 a horse

Captain Spillane is indignant that the
proprietor of the Cafe Royal should al

years to visit the place. Last evening
he instructed his men whose beats are
in the vicinity of the Cafe Royal to make

BLUE RIBBONS
THE REWARD
OF WHEELMEN
Race for Benefit of
Louis Gimm.
SOME SENSATIONALCONTESTS
OLYMPICS AND BAY CITY
WHEELMEN BREAK EVEN.
Harry Anthony, Flying the Winged
0, Carries Off Honors in Scratch.
Bace, Arthur Davidson
Winning Handicap
With no greater reward than bits of
blue ribbon to show for their efforts,
three score sturdy limbed wheelmen,
raced on the Olympic Club track, south,
of Golden Gate Park yesterday, with as
much enthusiasm as though the fate of
nations depended upon their efforts. The
occasion was the benefit tendered Louis
Gimm, the six-day rider who was stricken
down during the recent race in Mechanics'
Pavilion.
The programme was short, but interest
ing, and through the efforts of George
Dlxon it did not drag. The men entered
irto the spirit of the occasion, showing 1
seme grand sport. With the possible ex
ception of Walter ana Arthur Davidson,
there was an entire absence of the hit
men. They were not missed, as those on,
th< programme rode gamely and
desperately, those in attendance cheering
them on. The gathering was a friendly
one, being composed chiefly of members
of the various clubs.
Louis Gimm, the beneficiary, was warm
ly greeted when he stepped forward to
start the first race. He was cheered again
when he pinned the ribbons on the breasts
of the successful athletes.
The final of the nandlcap was won
cleverly by Harry Anthony. The pace
was easy until two laps to go. when the
ultimate winner started his effort. White
stalled him off until the last corner, when
Anthony slipped by and won cleverly by
a wheel's length.
Arthur Davidson caught his opponents
asleep in the handicap. Before they
realized how matters siood he had gained
a commanding lead, oi which they could
not deprive him.
The comedy element was supplied by
some Japanese riders, who had to bo
shooed off the track by Captain Spillane,
the younger, and big John Eliott before
they" would retire. The results in detail
follow:

COMMERCIAL BALLOONING.
NOT for vcars have commerci.il they are 1 been
so promising in California as they are to-day.
I " All down the long list of commodities quoted in
the market reports run-; the uniform statement oi an
active market and good prices. This appnes to both
farm produce and manufactured goods. Ihe onlj
exception throughout the whole list is hay, which has
been the dullest and deadest thing in town for some
weeks. Last year at this time it was selling at $iÃ@22
per ton; the quotations to-day are less than, half those
of 1898, being $/(Â£n as average prices, with a large
crop impending. Hay evidently had its boom last
year and is now paying the inevitable penalty, But
otherwise the farmer is doing remarkably well. His
wheat, oats and barley are bringing fair prices, his
potatoes are rising with unusual rapidity with short
supplies, his wool has been selling, off 'like hot cakes
for two months, his cattle, sheep and hogs arc higher
than for vcars. his butter and eggs are above the quo
tations usually ruling at this time of the year, his
poultry has been a profitable investment for some
time and a 3 lor his fruitâ it is in the clouds. He is
getting from $.^0 â â  $50 per ton for his apricots and
from $30 to $45 for his Bartlett pears, and the can
ncrs' agent-, are his eager and deferential customers.
The fruit grower is king of the farmers this year
owing to the February freeze throughout the country
east of the Sierra Nevadas, which played havoc with
fruit everywhere.
Nor is the farmer the only prosperous one. The
merchant is doing a good business, simply because the
farmer is in clover. It all comes back to the man
with the hoe after all. We write pitying poems about
him and draw pictures of him, but sometimes he is
cock of the walk, and this seems to be one of these
times. When the man with the hoe sells his humble
asnaracrus at $2 per box, as he has done this year,
he is making a good deal more money than his city
â  . - â â â¢â  . , . . , , , , ,
brother in his counting room, surrounded by sleek
and we'i dressed clerks. Still the city brother is do
ing very well too, at the moment. There is a certain
active demand for goods of all classes which no
body seems able to explain. It comes from every
where, North. South, hast and West, from Manila to
dcniianv and irom Alaska and Siberia to the west
coast. It takes in lumber, groceries, provisions,
canned goods, hardware, produce, machinery, cloth
inc. dry goods â all sorts of things. It really seems
like old times in San Francisco. Vessels nro in :
inand to move this merchandise and freights in some
lines have made r, marked advance, owing to made
<macy of tonriage, which in its turn makes the ship
ping trade as happy as the fanner and the merchant.
In default of an explanation for this remarkable de
â '-â ; t r' ' â â j '' â¢ â¢ 1
mand for goods, it is customary on the street to
ascribe it in general terms to ".McKinir.y prosperity,
which is probably a pretty close guess.
Tlic East, tofi. continues to make a fine exhibit. The
April failures were the smallest ever known, but the
May failures were still smaller. The distributive trade
is generally good througho-.it the country, and in
some sections is lively. The demand for iron passes
all belief. Prices for all kinds of iron and steel
products have advanced sharply, many more furnaces
have gone into blast and yet the famine grows more*
severe, as everybody who buys nails, wire and other
iron products have discovered' ere this. The call for
lumber continues unabated and prices have again been
marked up. Cotton goods are steady, with an in
creased inquiry in spite of higher prices.
The course of the wheat market is puzzling the
country at the moment. The winter crop of the
United States is seriously deficient, and reports of
partial and complete failures have been coming in
thick and fast from Europe, and yet the market is
singularly backward in responding. True, quotations
have advanced somewhat during the past fortnight,
but not nearly as much as the crop reports warrant.
This sluggishness is unaccountable.
Wall street opened the week with a decline, but it
did not last long. Toward the close of the week
prices took an upward turn, and though the hears
made a desperate fight they were forced to hunt for
cover. The announcement that $16,000,000 in gold
had been engaged for export was hailed as a factor
in heir favor, but it had a contrary and curious effect,
!v cased off the London market and thereby created a
buying demand there, which spread to Ampficrji
stocks, advancing their quotations, and thus proved a
boomerang. In fact all over the country, in Wall
.â¢street, in merchandise and on the farm, prices seem
determined to rise, and nothing apparently is able to
keep them down.
STREET RAILWAY BONDS AND

there can be no doubt of the right of the Market
Street Railway Company to guarantee the outstand
ing indebtedness of the various corporations of which
it became the successor, as well as to contract indebt
edness of its own. It has been expressly decided that
tions of that character in the issue of bonds
are entitled to exercise the powers of the original
companies whose property, franchises and debts it
takes and assumes. And in the case of Low vs. the
Central Pacific Railroad Company, 52 California Re

McKinstry dissented, our Supreme Court sustained

street railway bonds was justified, and the opinion is
an i: exposition of the law on that subject.
Even when an original issue of bonds was of ques
ble legality, but a number of them were trans
ferred to a bona fide purchaser after he ! - I received
factory assurances from the vice president, the
secretary and the attorney of the company that had
put them in circulation, the corporation was bound

for the Southern District of California, in the case
of th< Union 1 â  in and Trust Company vs. The
S â â â¢'â  â¢â  I . lifornia Motor Company, published in

are many authorities in support of the right of buna
purchasers of railway bonds Iri open market, and
nice distil I 1 : qualifications affecting those
rights where there was palpable invalidity in the :
or where 1 r-i I bonds,are frequent.
YVhil â  inclination to maintain the inter
: purchasers is manifest, there are in
stances in which that tendency is controlled by plain
l;.w. The same Federal tribunal already mentioned
in tin ' Farmers' Loan and Trust Company
vs. The San Diego C:>r Company, 45 Federal Re
8, was compelled to throw out bonds
which were not sold, but used by way of pledge to se
cun â  indebtedness. In Texas, where there
some constitutional features peculiar to that State,
;.n issue of bonds was invalidated because no sinking
fund had been provided for their redemption. This
decision has an important bearing upon some of the
to which we are about to allude.
I: manifestly impossible in a newspaper article
t.i elaboi egal propositions and authorities. But
gh may be concisely presented to suggest cau
tious inquiry and considi ration. It i^ obvious, apart
from the personal liability of stockholders and the
by which irregular corporate pro
ings may often be corrected, that the available
;tr< it railway I I | pend upon the
practical security for their liquidation, and that the
franchises which vitalize the security arc the most
important elements for accurate judgment. It is to

corporation, through which its powers are
conferred by the State, is always to be distinguished
the municipal franchises that, while they last,
constitute the chief factors in the actual value of its
â¢
Railway Company was incoÂ»"
--1893, for a general street railway
1 0 and in San Mateo County.
It col ted eleven other corporations, among
which the Geary street line- was not included. It lias
since acquired about 60 per cent of the stock in the
corp â  owning that line, the franchise of whic,h
will expin r 6, 1903, and is thus interested
in tl ount of $671,000 that will ma
ture when the â  I barter has for years been dead.
But of the eleven corporations embraced in the con
dation c ix had outstanding bonds secured by trust
5, and in relation to this indebtedness the
cond ts are very significant. We will en
deavor succinctly to present them. The Ferries and
Cliff House Railway Company, with many franchises,
ranging from twenty five to fifty years in duration,
of them already expired, others to terminate in
[902, in too.), in iÂ«n 1 and in i<)ij, and two extending
respectively to 1929 and 1031. has outstanding bond-.
to the amount 000 which will mature in 1914.
The Market Street Cable Company, with one fran
chise which expired in [897, another limited to 1904
jeveral which will last from [929 to 1933, is rcpre
â l by bonds to tin- amount of $,^.000,000 that will
, mature in to 13. The ( Mnnibus Cable Railway, with
franchises which will terminate at various periods be
en 1909 and [939, has outstanding bonds aggre
â¢ !,oÃs,ooo that will fall due in 101 X. The bonds
of the Park and Cliff House Railway foot up only
.000 and will mature in 191.3. The Park and
Ocean Railroad has outstanding bonds to the amount
1.1 $250,000 that will become due in 1014. The Powell
t Railway's bonds in the market are of the
â mt of $700,000 and will mature in 1912. The sum
if all these bonds is $-.0,15.000.
The entire propi rty and assets of these six corpora
tions, necessarily subject to their secured indebted
ness under the rules established by section 473 of the
Civil Code, passed to the Market Street Railway
Company in 1893. June 28, 1894, that corporation
THE SA"tf FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, JUKE 5, 1899.
adopted a resolution to create a bonded indebtedness
of $17,500,000. bearing interest at the rate of 5 per
! cent per annum, to cover the obligations of the six
1 companies it had absorbed, to purchase other railways
and .to pay for future construction and equipment.
These bonds will mature in io.-'-i- To secure them, on
July 12, ISO 4. a trust mortgage to the Union Trust
Company of San Francisco was executed, which coy
: cred all the consolidated railways, as well as future
I acquisitions and extensions, ana recited an intention,
i as rapidly as practicable, to retire the bonds of the
six corporations which within the limits of the law
had transferred all their property and franchises.
Since October 13, 1893, the Market Street Railway
Company has obtained additional franchises of its
own and has expended $4,817,000 in construction, to
which amount its bonds have been issued and are in
circulation. But the bonds of the six railways which
it absorbed, after the lapse of nearly six years, are
still listed in the Stock and Bond Exchange and are
daily bought and sold, and while the Market Street
Railway Company has the combined assets and their
exclusive management, beyond the declaration in the
trust mortgage, which apparently has remained tor
pid, the holders of bonds to the amount of $7,035,000
have no other securities than the transferred and
slowly vanishing franchises and property by which
principally the Market Street Railway Company has
secured its own bonds, issued and unissued. What
its ultimate intentions may be it is not possible to con
jecture, but upon its face the situation is not encour
aging and appears to be fraught with peril to the
financial interests of investors. As a business propo
sition there is no evidence that the $12,683,000 of un
issued bonds are to be used for the purposes to which
they were originally intended to be applied. If this be
the fact then before long there may be danger of a
panic in this class of securities.
But suppose the outstanding bonds of the six sub
sidiary and collapsed corporations and of the Market
Street Railway Company be added together and the
! entire indebtedness charged to the latter. The sum
total is $11,852,000, and the question at once arises as
to the provision made for the liquidation of the bonds
due in IQ-4- The trust mortgage, which expressly
authorizes the use of these bonds to the amount of
$10,465,000 for new purchases and for additional con
struction, provides for no sinking or redemption fund
until 1918, and then only at the rate of $160,000 per
annum, which in six years would produce $960,000
to pay obligations to the amount of $11,852,000. By
that time many of the existing franchises will have
lapsed. The result would inevitably be disastrous if
toward the maturity of the bonds the conditions
should be, as every visible indication suggests, that
apart from personal liability or equitable proceedings
the only security left for the bondholders would be
the remnants of perishing franchises and a mass of old
iron and other worn out property.
It i-, simply fair also to bear in mind that the policy
of the New Charter, practicalized in its text, is the
acquisition of public utilities and against renewals,
which, even though they could be certainly antici
pated, would not enter into a financial estimate of the
present or prospective value of securities in this in
congruous condition. The terms moreover on which,
under the coming system of municipal government,
renewals are tol< rated are not favorable to specula
tive operations in street railway bonds. By section 6
of the New Charter not only are street railway fran
, chises limited in duration to twenty-rive years and
ompanied by the exaction of greatly enlarged per
centages on gross receipts, but their indorsement re
quires ;i three-fourths vote of eighteen Supervisors.
which would be exactly thirteen and one-half, and to
Override vetoes by the Mayor in each instance fifteen
would be essential.
There are issued 186,170 shares of the capital stock
of the Market Street Railway Company, on which a
rterly dividend of 00 cents per share, or $111,702
altogether, is paid. The stock is quoted at from '.:'.>
to ''.i.-. It is thus manifest that the original bonds of
six -virtually extinct companies and the bonds of the
iolidation to the amount of at least $11,852,000,
and with the prospect of a large addition for other
\ acquisitions and construction, are secured by the same
property; that the distinct securities for the original
bonds are under the sole control of the Market Street
Railway Company; that the value of these securities
depends mainly upon franchises that will gradually
' revert to the municipality, unaffected by any incum
brances; that no adequate provision for the redemption
of the new bonds has been made, and that, in the face
of these facts, the value of the Market Street Railway
stock is maintained by the withdrawal in the form of
dividends of itscurrent income to the aggregate yearly
amount of $446,808, which at the time of the maturity
of the $17,500,000 of new bonds in i<)_'4, if continued
at the same rate, would reach the enormous sum of
$11,170,200. This is a diversion of funds at the ex
pense of creditors that is simply astonishing.
Unless The Call is greatly deceived it has supplied
conclusive reasons for the projected raid of the street
railway monopoly through corrupt Supervisors, and
has also presented facts and figures which will enable
the community to comprehend the imminent danger
to street railway indebtedness resulting from specu
lative and unfair manipulation.

THE TWO CURRENT
MINING BOOMS
The mining field presents just now two
popular "excitements." and these plctur
i sque things of persistent recurrence al
ways attract more attention than
more Important and legitimate develop
ments in old and rich mining regions.
There is a rush to some alleged redis
covered placers in Lower California, and
in the San Joaquin Valley there is a grea<
oil hoom on, attended by the usual crazy
formation of wild-cat companies by the
hundred, speculation in worthless stocks
and properties, the location, bonding and
buying of miles of desert bills and proph
t cies of sudden fort am b.
The foundation of the oil craze is the
really important development of a small
but remarkable, oil Held, at Oil City, a
few miles from Coalinga, on the western
noV of the valley, in Fresno County. This
is notable as being the first producing
field of Importance developed north of
thi- Tehachapi Mountains after nearly
forty yens of prospecting through the
central ami northern parts of the State.
The storm center of the Txiwer Califor
nia boom is San Diego, from which point
the craze Is ably stimulated in the usual
way by newspaper correspondents and
transportation and other business inter
ests which will profit thereby. In San
Francisco the Mexican Consul-General,
Mr. Coney, is receiving Inquiries about
the field by the hundreds, and from many
points a good Bized rush is fairly on. A
stampede to a new gold field is as easy
to check as a stampede of a great cattle
herd, and the judicious may as well keep
out of its way.
No definite information about the Sierra
Pintada field has been given, and none
seems obtainable from any Bource. In
the columns of newspaper reports that
are published the accounts are l>ut vague
rumors of "millions in sight." No gold
worth speaking of has come out. Consul-
General Coney knows only what is in
the papers, and no mining authorities ac
quainted with Lower California are able
to say anything without visiting the
place. But it requires only vague rumors
to start a mining rush and keep it up un
til the bottom falls out. There may be a
pood deal of gold down there, for the stuff
is where you find it, and there are un
doubtedly plac< b where gravel can be
worked with j>r< 'Tit by the "dry washing
process; but it is certain that nine out of
ten of the rushers will come out of that
desert poorer and thinner than they
went in. The Ybarra Gold Mining Com
pany of this city, which holds large con
cessions and works a good mine sixty
miles from the new field, has sent a re
liable expert, M. G. Rhodes, in, and in
two or three weeks candid reports from
him and others of reliability will show
what there really is there.
In a letter from San I>iego dated May
28 Mr. Rhodes said: "The papers here
are determined to get up a boom. Do not
allow them to carry you off your feet.
There is really little more known about
the mines than when we left the city. \\ c
do not believe last night's report of the
largo amount of gold sent to Guaymas.
The. San Joaquin Valley oil craze Is
nearer home. The lons-standing faith of
Oil exports that profitable oil discoveries
will be made at many places along the
coast range from the Southern oil fields
north clear to Humboldt County is one
help to the boom. The geological for
mations, sandstones and shales, are fav
orable to nil deposits throughout a region
hundreds of miles long, and the thousands
<â¢!" * â¢ i l s> epages to be seen he-re and there
show the widespread existence of oil. But
an "i! seepage does not indicate an en
closed reservoir of <>il that there is money
in. Mini with a few small exceptions no
borings north of Tehachapi had over pro
duced a. (low of nil until lurk came to two
men who went to bnring at oil City in
1896. For two years there has been an
Increasing amount of prospecting for oil .
in Monterey, San Benlto, Santa Clara.
Han Mateo, Contra Costa an the San
Joaquin Valley counties, and more good
iidds will undoubtedly be struck. The
Sunset nil field of Kern County has pro
duced a little for years, and In Moody's
Gulch, Hunta Clara County, a few barrels
a day have been pumped for twonty years, I
The Oil City region has been We -
of former failures. About twelve years
an English company spent $200,000 In
developing a worthless coal mine near
there, and Coalinga, near Alcalde, the
terminus of the branch railroad forty
miles west of Hanford, was the result. In
i v :>:: the Puerte <>n Company of tx>s An- ;
geles began operations on some oil indi
cations at what is now Oil City, ten
Bliles from Coalinga. They spent about
$30,000 and quit. Others tried and quit, in
1896 C. A. Canfield and J. A. Chanslor,
who had had experience In the Los An
geles fit Id, got financial backing and went
to work with faith and derricks on the
abandoned ground. They struck a quite
r< in.trka.hle BOW of oil last year and have
bi i n shipping over a thousand barrels a
day for some time. Canfield it Chans
lor are already rich. They control the
field and are the "oil kings" of the San
Joaquin Valley. Their brilliant success
naturally got an oil craze fairly going
last winter, and now it is bigger than
ever. Along the foothills of the eastern
Bio] t the coast range from Kern
County north there is a belt <>f n\\ indi
cations and of favorable geological for
mation, and all along this region land
i has been taken by oil operators by the
thousands of acres. It is an arid, deso
late and unpopulated region, but little of
it has escaped,
In Fresno, Visalia, Selmn, Tular<\ Bak
ersfleld and other valley towns companies
have been formed right and left. Tt is
said that in twenty-five days this spring
forty-six companies were incorporated.
' Some are legitimate and promising. Oth
i rs are founded on any old patch of sage
â  brush, and find a lively Held for stork
1 sales. Tt is likely that out of this craze
will come a few good wells In other places '
and a considerable development of the oil
resources of the region, though most of
the stock buyers will get loft.
Therp has been a good deal of boom
stuff written about Oil City. J. H. Means,
field deputy of the State Mining Bureau,
lias returned from a month's study of
that region, and his account is a reliable
statement of the situation. In an inter
view he said:
iÂ» "I spent most of my time at Oil City,
i which Is the only producing district, and
I made brief visits south through Fresno
nmi Kings Counties. There are quite a
good many wells at Oil City, but some
are old and have never produced much
if any oil. Six or eight new wells have
been sunk within two years and they are j
fine producers. As near as I could learn
the present production is from 2500 to 3000
barrels a day, but this could soon be
nearly doubled by sinking old wells deep
er and working produ<crs to their full
capacity. Several are down nearly to
tlie oil sand. I suppose the market limits
the production yet. Five or six drilling
rigs are running and others are being j
pr< pared. About twelve wells could be I
now made productive. The largest is i
down about 1400 feet and flows about 400
barrels a day.
"The half dozen producing wells are all
: flowing wells. The oil is accompanied by
a good deal of gas and it flows with great j
j force. In the strongest wells the Oil
i would shoot perhaps a hundred feet high !
iif given free vent. Borne of the derricks I
show how the oil spurted to their tops 'â .
when it was struck. The oil flow is gen- !
erally intermittent. Tt will rush mil for
a few minutes and then for a few minutes j
then will be only a rush of gas. Small
pipes radiate from the capping of the well
casing to tanks and at the tanks the pipes
are anchored down to withstand the re
coil of the Bow as it is turned downward i
in the tank. The well casings vary from !
sr;i5 r ;i to Uv'k inches. The oil comes from j
' deep sandstone strata enclosed by im- !
; pervious clay shales. This has confined
the gns also," and the strong flow is caus
ed by the gas pressure, aided perhaps by
water and rods pressure. The gas is used
for fuel, and no other fuel is used for en
gines, cooking and so on. The oil is very
light and of a greenish color. It is lighter
than the Southern California oils, and it is
claimed to he a better fuel, it has the
usual asphalt base, and its lightness is
due to the fact that its hydrocarbons
have hail no chance to volatilize.
"The oil is all piped ten miles to the
railroad at Coalinga from three tanks
said to have 30,000 gallons' capacity. From
Coalinga it is shipped in tank cars to va- j
rious points north and south. The oil is
all produced in an area not exceeding a
half mile long and a quarter broad, but
a larger territory will doubtless bo made
productive. Many people are boring or
preparing to do so. I think the yield will
ie fairly permanent The extent of the
field is uncertain and will depend on the
prospecting. The geological formation
may be favorable and the geological
structuro not no. The oil may be con
flnej in :i porous stratum and It may
! hayÂ« escaped.
"A Kuoii (1.,,! n f land along that side of
the v;tiiey offers Inducements for pros
pecting and this boom will bring it. In
Tar Canyon in Kings County, west of old
Lake Tulare, a company is putting up
buildthgs and getting ready to drill. A
little north of there four wells are be
ing put down. A good many are prepar
ing for prospecting operations, and no
doubt nomo good strikes will be made.
There is a groat deal of interest in the
Oil tiolds all through that country, and a
gond df;ii of wildcattlng is being done and
much worthless land being whooped up
by promoters. Every fool of land for
miles has been taken up. Oil City is com
posed of a few cabins in a barren desert
region, a^d its water is piped to it from
] the hills to the east. I expect to make
another visit in a month or so."
Everything is favorable for a much
larger spread of the oil fever. New wells
and fields recently brought to the front
in Southern California help stimulate the
interest. The widespread prospecting
1 that is going on in Central and Northern
California can hardly fall to result in oth
er strikes [ike that at Oil City, and then
the interest will be further fired.
It is not generally remembered that
California has had two large oil excite
ments before. One was in 1864-65 and the
other in the 70s. The first one was a
royal craze. Its course can be traced in
a long series; of newspaper clippings of
that day in a r.crap book in the possession
of State Mineralogist A. S. Cooper. It
came as a supplement to the wild Penn
sylvania oil erjize of the early '60's, when
the first Oil City found fame. That craze,
which spread well over the East, caught
California in it fc- tide. Nobody here knew
much about oil then, but attention was
turned to the "indications" to be found
in plenty and r.he sensation was enor
mous. The interesting tale can be but
briefly given here.
The California <>il excitement was as big
East as West. The Eastern papers tnld
extraordinary tales of California oil,
backed by export reports of the marvel
ous oleaginous wealth. Cattle were
drowned right nlong in pools of petro
leum. During ISH and early '6.'. many
great oil stock companies were floated it;
the East. The Philadelphia Railroad and
Mining Register of December 3, W4, said:
"California oil hand shares, subscribed
for in this city at n r " M "> per share, payable
in gold, advanced $600 in gold per share
two days after the subscription books
were filled."
Southern California was the chief sce'io
of these wildcat EaÂ» tern operations. One
promoter bought a lianta Barbara rancn
for $10,000 and telegri iphod the price, to a
partner, who sold a iialf Interest for ?./\
--000. It was then sol.i for $450,000. Then :t
was made the assets of the California Pe
troleum Company of ;UO.Ooi>.OOft capital. It
was whooped up by the column by the
Eastern Press. In the New York Inde
pendent we find that In one of the eigh
teen springs "'marked l^n. 1 on the map."
there was 144,5< >>,0<X> gallons of oil actually
in sight. To be conservative it was as
sumed that only ten of ;the springs wouid
bo productive. On this assumption there
would be a yearly yield of oil worth
$5,460,000. One-t-nth of the capital stock
was reserved as a working capital an 1
half of it was actually sold at $.V> a share.
Other comp.-mus capitaliied for millions
i helped exhaust the power < >f the language
to portray the marvels of California oil
fields.
But in California itself eoiTipanios were
formed by hundreds. The State was oil
mad from Humboldt to S.-vi Diepo. The
slightest seepage of oil about a spring or
the smell of it in a marsh or elsewhere
was enough to start a rus),h and make
sure that great wealth was .lust below.
The country papers teemed with jiocounts
Of oil discoveries and oil wel; s. A good
sample Is given by the Napa Reporter of
March 25, 11-:",I 1 -:", in an account of a recent
discovery and rush:
"Last wÂ» ek a hired man who was ex
cited by tho reports of oil discoveries in
othor sections of tho State was set dig
ging in the Bwamp for some purpose, in
; a short time? he cried wildly, 'I've struck
i it! I've struck it!' and dropped to the.
â  ground with his head over tho n<= wlymade
hole. On Mr. Goodrich appearing much
: amazed, he was told: 'Here i.s an oil
springâ smell the oil!' holding up a hand
ful of the fresli mud. whose strong kero
sene odor wai- unmistHkaMe i-vjdence.
Measures have been taken for ttv> liuuie
' diate Incorporation of a petroleum com
' pany with a capital stock of $fl00,(lÂ»."
Every county along the coast range
shared in the wild craze. Scores of re
gions where prospect wells are now being
driven were staked out by rushers then.
I Fresno County waa included, of course,
an.] in view of the present craze, j-.nd of
the development of tho first prnn ucing
wells it is of intercut. The Fresno '.rimes
of March 29, 1863, says: "Our last, ad
vices from the oil region in this county
ar.' very encouraging. Tho exciteiment
: remains at fever heat." That might have
been used again last week. Many .-.uu
panles were formed then to work the
Fresno oil fields, but it was destined to
be thirty-live years before oil was really
struck in that promising oil region.

Captain Lieutenant yon Rebuer-Pash
witz, naval attache of the German Em
bassy at "Washington, recently expn d
his opinion of American ships, their con
struction and details, all of which r *
with the captain's approval, although r.T
a somewhat condescending way, whicn,
considering the fact that the actual war
experience of the ships and personnel of
the German navy has yet to be gone
through, takes away much of the. value of
the approbation of this officer. On the
joet of the officer personnel he makes the
following remarks: "The American naval
officers have much technical knowl<
perhaps more than Gorman officers, but it
is a question whether technical know
cannot bo carried too far t luslon
of those larger subjects of strategy, tor
pedo maneuvering, etc. You have just
united the engineer branch with thi
lar line of the navy, so that hereafter all
your naval officers will also have I
steam engineers. That is carrying
nical knowledge ' very far, and will put
such great requirements on your officer
that the results will be awaited with
much interest by students of naval af
fairs. When officers are compelled to
master such a mass of details they have
scant time for considering the larger
questions of attack and d< '1 the
real science of warfare. They become too
mechanical. The great naval command
ers are not merely engineers, but men of
intellectual attainments, thought and
statesmanship, as well as technical
knowledge of ropes and Irons."

THE VOYAGE IN
A COCKLE SHELL
Capt. Freitsch Sails in
Schooner Coke.
HE IS BOUND FOR FAR MANILA
MANY PERSONS SAW HIM START
ON HIS PERILOUS TRIP.
Robert Williams, a Cook on the Zea
landia, Arrested and Charged
With Stealing Clothes Prom
the Soldiers.
It was an exceptionally quiet day along
the water front yesterday. There were
no arrivals, and the only departure of
any importance was the schooner Coke,
â which sailed for Manila. This vessel is
ocly five tons, and is probably one of the
lightest draught vessels that has ever at
tempted such a voyage. Captain Freitsch,
v.-ho claims to have made a journey across
tho Atlantic in this same vessel, will now
attempt to reach the Philippines in his
boat. He goes alone upon his perilous
voyage. The Coke is a thorough seagoing
craft of her kind, and her venturesome
skipper docs not anticipate any trouble
in making the trip. He sailed from the
Mission-street wharf about 10 o'clock, and
there was a large crowd gathered to
see the cockle shell begin her voyage.
Some- of the skeptical suggested that
Captain FYeltsch would go outside of the
lioads and then change his mind. The
last seen of the Coke was when she dis
appeared through the Gate, and she had
rot returned up to a late hour last night,
no Captain Freitsch evidently held upon
his course. He is known as one of the
most daring navigators of small vessels.
For a long time he had the Coke on ex
hibition along tho water front.
The Zealandia docked at the wharf of
the Pacille Mail Steamship Company yes
terday. She took the place of the steam
or txneda, which went up to the refinery
to discharge her cargo of sugar. Early
yesterday morning Officer McGlynn ar
rested a negro on the iSealandia by the
name of Robert Williams, who is charged
by the captain of the vessel with petty
larceny. Williams was taken to the Har
bor Police Station. He was cook on the
Zealandia. and it is charged that he stole
some clothes from the soldiers on tho
trip up. He was in irons when the vessel
reached here, and just as soon as she
docked he was turned over to the police.
Williams is from Salt Lake City. He has
been in the transport service for some
time and denies that he is guilty of the
t! eft. He will be turned over to the
Foderal authorities tins morning.
The battleship lowa will Ball for the
north to-morrow. Many people took ad-,.
vantage of the beautiful weather to pay
a last visit to the ship. Excursion
launches were kept busy plying between
the lowa and the wharf. Quite a large
number of people also visited tho
Japanese training ship Hayel. At the
Folsom-streel wharf the transports City
or Puebla and the Sheridan were
clocked. It is probable that the latter
will be the first of the two to sail.

CORPUS CHRISTI CELEBRATED
WITH POMP AND CEREMONY
The fenst of Corpus Christi was cele
brated i<Â» all the Catholic churches of this
city yesterday in a solemn manner. Every
edifice was crowded with worshipers |
deeply Interested in the services of the i
day. Little girls attired in their pretty !
white dresses and bearing flowers and |
young boys carrying lighted candles made j
the procession of the Blessed Sacrament i
a brilliant spectacle.
In Catholic countries the feast of
Corpus Christi is always celebrated on a
fixed Thursday, but in this country it
is observed on the Sunday following that
Thursday for the greater accommodation
of the people. The words Corpus Christi
mean the body of Christ. It is the out
ward public solemn profession of the
illc faith, namely the actual though
invisible presence of Christ under the
euchariatic element; so that the worship
of Corpus Christi is meant for and is of
fered directly to the second person of the
Trinity, Christ, the Son of God. In the lit
urgies of the church all the great mys
teries "i" God, as the Trinity, the incar
nation, the mysteries of Christ's life,
death ;u\<) resurrection, the lives and
deeds of the meat servams of God who
are called saints, are commemorated In
ssion from the opening of the year
to Its close. Hence the mystery of the
Real Presence has its day of solemn cele
lir:itii>!i.

FLOWERS STREWN BEFORE THE BLESSED SACRAMENT
; tended by the parishioners, who came at
all hours, from early morn until late at
', night, to offer their homage to Christ
j and to ask through him all the graces,
temporal and spiritual, they need. The
observance of the forty .hours Is one of
rotation. It is held in all the churches
of i lie diocese in succession, and where
there are more churches than there are
periods of forty hours In the rear, then
levotion is duplicated, taking place
simultaneously in two churches. The ser
vices began at the 11 o'clock mass and
; will continue until Tuesday until 10 a. m.

Blessed Bacrameht. Forty little acolytes
in their red surplices followed, holding
lighted candles. Behind them were the
priests, vested in their "alb" and
â¢â chasuble" Preceding the Blessed Sac
rament were - c ix little boys, who scat
tered flowers in front of it, and behind

that were presented. Father D. Lane was
celebrant of the mass; Rev. P. J. Keane,
deacon; Rev. M. Horan, sub-deacon, nnd
Rev. J. Brennan, master of ceremonies.
During the mass Father Brennan deliv
ered an able sermon on the feast. In part
he said:
Throughout the world last Thursday was Bet
apart by the Catholic Church for the celebra
tion of the feast of Corpus Christi. On that
day the glories and aublime mysteries of the
most blessed oucharlst were observed. To the
United States of America the privilege has been
granted by our Holy Father to celebrate this
feast to-day. It Is true that the sacrament of
the holy eucharist was not instituted on the
feast of Corpus Christi. but on Holy Thursday.
When the Institution took place the church was
shrouded in gloom and was plunged In the
deepest sorrow for the suffering of our divine
Bpouse, and hence she could not celebrate this
great feast in a manner becoming such a joy
ous occasion. She therefore waited until to-day,
when, in the thoughtfulness or her heart, she
called together all her children to honor this
feast with becoming' splendor and magnificence.
Henre to-day there are feelings of Joy in every
Catholic heart and words of rejoicing on every
Catholic tongue. The bells ring forth their
tones of joy, the organ peals its notes of glad
ness; soul-stirring music with which the church
resounds brings us so much nearer to heaven:
the altars are decorated with fair flowers and
brilliant with radiant lights. The incense rolls
to heaven like prayers ascending before the
throne of God. and the priest at the conclu
sion of the mass opens wide the door of the
tabernacle arid with most reverent care takes
forth the most blessed sacrament and carries It
In triumphant procession through the church.
The Law <â¢! God of Hosts, who from under the
white canopy looks around upon the joyous
- â  ne and graciously blesses all as he passes
by.
Hut as far as the real presence of our Lord
in the holy eucharist is concerned, we require
no special feast to convince us of it. We be
lieve In the Catholic doctrine of the eucharist
With all the earnestness of our hearts. This
belief is deep down In the very bottom of our
souls. We have ilrunk it in in our infancy: it
â¢ \vn with nur growth; It has strengthened
with our strength, and such a firm huld It has
got upon us that we look upon It as a standard
of eertaintv. and such certainty that no amount
of evidence can act upon us. We rome Into the
church, we kneel down, we pray to Jesus,
really present in the blessed sacrament, and as
long as that firm conviction lasts who will
say that we shall be unable to analyze the
ground of '>ur belief that It Is so?
At the conclusion of the mass there
was a procession, in which three hundred
children of St. Patrick'? and St. Vincent's
schools took part. The girls were In
1 whin- dresses, wore white wreaths and all
carried flowers. The boys were all dressed
in black with white ribbons on their arms
and bearing candles. As they marched
they sang "Pange Langua Glorioso."
Twenty-four altar boys headed the stately
procession. Their leader bore ai the head
! a large crucifix and the others carried
lighted candles. Following them were
the girls with Katie Hagerty at their
head, holding aloft the banner of the
Blessed Virgin. Maggie Pbilbin also car
rled the banner of her school. Robert
Barrett led the boys with the banner of
i St. Patrick's school upraised. Sixteen
I little maidens were next in line scattering
Rowers on the iloor before the blessed Bac
rament. Preceding the latter were two al
tar boys, Jerry Reagan and James Trod
den, who lilK-d the sacred edifice with
incense from their swinging censors. Four
boys supported the while canopy, under
which were the participants in the mass.
Afier the procession returned to the
altar the benediction of the Blessed Sac
rament was given.
In the evening eighteen young men and
thirty - two boys, composing the St.
Patrick's Choral Society, chanted the
Gregorian chant. The following members
of the choral society participated In the
singing:

! the subject "Belief for the Man With
the Hoe."
Previous to the services a lady and gen
tleman walked up to the chancel rail and,
In the presence of the congregation, were
married by Dr. Wilson. The contract
ing parties, Hiram Elbert McEuen and
Mary Ellen McDonald, after being pro
nounced man and wife, quietly sat down
again and were interested .isteners at
the exercises.
A life-size painting of ' me Man With
tno Hoe." painted by Mrs. Chandler, was
hung In full view, and Miss Jennie Long
recited the poem which has saused such
i a stir in the literary world. In his ser
; mon Dr. Wilson stated that the relief for
down-trodden humanity rested with the
Lord Jesus Christ, who had said: "Come |
unto me, ye who labor and are heavy
laden, and 1 will give you rest." Profes
sor Markham' s address was as follows: ,
My (hiir friends: I have been asked to Bay !
i a few words about the "man with the hoe,"
J and my solution of the problem. I have no new
solution. The problem itself is as old a? hu
manity. The men who built the pyramids
struggled, and the men who are now building
London are struÃKlinK w ith that problem.
One solution is the application of the
"Golden Rule." We have committed it to
heart; lei us commit it to life. (Applause.)
That Is thr- only solution. As to what steps
j should be taken 1 cannot say. The Republi
cans, Democrats, Socialists and Single Takers
offer different solutions. It is wise for us to
consider all of them and try to find some way
(>f enlarging the sphere of justice for all men.
i believe that the industrial question is a re- i
ligious question. (Applause.) Everything that j
has to do with the welfare of man in poll
tic^ or in industry is religious at the bot
-1 torn Everything Bhows our relation to one
'â  another and our relation to tho Father of L,ife.
Jesus of Nazareth is the Father, the Savior of
the human race. In his principle of justice and
ol brotherhood we find the solution of these
problems. Fraternity, to me, is the dearest of
all words, and In thut word Is the hope of the
human race.
At the conclusion of the services many
of the congregation shook hands with i
Mr MarKam and wished him godspeed
in his journey to the Bast, for which he | ,
Will leave in a few (lays.
BODIES FOUND IN THE BAY.
The Remains of Two More Unfortu-
nates Are Recovered.
The body of Harry Philip Muck, the boy
who fHI off the stringer at Fishermen's
Wharf on Saturday morning, was found
whore it had sunk yesterday afternoon by
Charles Hodges and Henry Desmond, who
bad been grappling for it during the fore
noon.
When taken from the bottom of the bay
the little fellow's legs were found entan
gled by 8 tish line, which would go to
show that he had been fishing when he
attempted to walk along the stringer
: when last seen by his companions, Kelly
and Edwards, who ran away and left him
â to his fate. Deputy Coroners Sullivan
and Gatley, acting under instructions
from Coroner Hill, convoyed the body to
| the home of tht- boy's parents at 11 Van
dewater street, where It was received by
the distracted father and mother.
Earlier in the day the body of an un
known man was found In the north cove
of Goat Island by Richard Wise, the
lighthouse keeper of the island. After
considerable difficulty In reaching it
Deputy t'oroner George Lacombe con
veyed *it to the Morgue. Prom the ap
pearance of the remains the body has
been In the bay for fully a month, the
features being unrecognizable.
The unknown was about 5 feet 11 inches
in height, of stout build; clad in a black
j diagonal vest, black pantaloons Cribbed),
red and white-striped shirt and laced
shoes. Both forearms bore tattooed marks
of a woman.

Sick Women Advised to Seek
Advice of Mrs. Pinkham.
[LETTER TO MRS. FINKHAM NO. 94,863]
"I had inflammation and falling
of the womb, and inflammation of
ovaries, and was in great pain. 1 took
medicine prescribed by a physician,
but it did me no good. At last I heard
of Lj-dia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Com-
pound, and after using it faithfully I
am thankful to say I am a well women.
I would advise all suffering women to
seek advice of Mrs. Pinkham." â Mrs.
G. H. Chatpell, Grant Pabk, 111.
11 For several years my health was
miserable. I suffered the most dread-
ful pains, and was almost on the verge
of insanity. I consulted one of the
best phj'sicians in New York, and he
pronounced my disease a fibroid tumor,
advising an operation without delay,
saying that it was my only chance for
life. Other doctors prescribed strong
and violent medicine, and one said I
was incurable, another told me my
only salvation was galvanic batteries,
which I tried, but nothing relieved me.
One day a friend called and begged me
to try Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable
Compound. I began its use and took
several bottles. From the very first
bottle there was a wonderful change
for the better. The tumor has disap-
peared entirely and my old spirits have
returned. I heartily recommend j-our
medicine to all suffering women." â

MERCHANTS' PICNIC
Dealers of This City Will Hie Them
selves to El Campo.
A committee of wholesale merchants of
San Francisco have agreed to hold a pic
nic thlp year. For the past two years
none has been held by the wholesalers
for various reasons, and now that there
is a desire and a demand for one, It has
b n en deckled to afford a day of enjoy
â¢ at El Campo on Saturday, June 10.
Saturday, being a half business day,
was chosen as most fitting, and gives an
opportunity for the employes and their
families to participate, as a great ma
jority of the houses will close entirely.
A 1 oat will leave at 9:30 a. m., and for
those who cannot leave their business and
employment at that time it has been de
cided to have another boat depart at 1
p. m. Both boats return at about. 5:30
p. m. There will be a great number of
rate and game prizes for all. Blanchard's
Hand has been secured for the day. Tick
nve been reduced to 50 cents per
round trip; children 25 cents. Any surplus
derived will be devoted to the Children's
Hospital

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, JITKE 5, 1899.
SAN JOSE AND
OAKLAND EACH
TAKE A GAME
Two Beautiful Base
ball Contests.
ALMOST PERFECT FIELDING
FOUR DOUBLE PLAYS MADE
DURING THE AFTERNOON.
Dudes Miss a Golden Opportunity to
Score and the Dentists Return
Home Well Sat
isfied.
After two successive defeats, the tooth
carpenters from San Jose went against
the Dudes again at Recreation Park yes-
I trrday afternoon and won out by a score
of 3 to 2 in a contest that never devel
oped a dull or uninteresting spot.
The morning game at Golden Gate was
also a pretty contest, far better than the
score would indicate. It was a pitcher's
battle and the Officeholders managed to
m;tkp their shots just when safe hits
counted the most. Johnson was brought
back into game, and although his head
Is still troubling him severely, he fielded
his position nicely and tore oft three hits
in the two contests.
S;in Jose played a much steadier game
than it did Saturday, but was unfortun
, ate in not being able to hit when men
were on the cushions. Thirteen runners
left on bases shows the extent to which
they suffered from this misfortune. There
was a nice attendance, and when the
new electric road is in operation, giving
the Oakland cranks some means of reach
j ing the grounds besides working their
passage out on bicycles or being churned
in a home-made bus for an hour, the
; morning games at Golden Gate will prove
more profitable to the managers.
With the exception of a week ago, the
' crowd at Recreation Park In the after
noon was the largest of the season, and
every crank fully expected, in view of
i the turmoil that marked Saturday's pro
â  ceedinge, to witness a recurrence of hos
tilities, with possible bloodshed. But In
this they were disappointed, for the storm
clouds had entirely disappeared, the only
sign of the previous day's bitterness be
ing shown when Donovan went to bat in
' the first inning. Borchers was In the box
. for San Jose. It may have been acci
dental, or the Chief may have recalled
the jolt in the face Donovan gave Han
lon the day before, but however that may
be. Donovan was soaked by the first ball
' pitchedâ a wide inshoot that came with
, the speed that only the Chief can give a
; ball. Donovan grunted audibly and ca
j ressed his aching slats as he trotted to
first and for some time afterward, while
Borchers grinned sardonically and waited
for the next man. â¦Â»,ââ _
Ewing and McGraw must have fed their
men lot lunch oa these little .^peed
lozenges they sometimes use at the rare
track for every one of the eighteen ath
letes was gingered up to the hmlt. Foi r
double plays in the first four inn ngs, of
which three fell to Oakland tells the
kind of ball that was played. And It was
fully appreciated by the spectators, the
majority of whom seemed to sympathize
with the dental operators.
The dudes played a fielding game such
as is seldom equaled and again demon
strated that they are the most finished
fielders In the league. Lange .Schmeer
and Peebles fairly ate base hits and
fhrew like fiends. Outflelding honors f
to Dunleavv, who throw one man out at
firm from deep left, completing a double
play, and pinched another at the plate.
fcussell pitched the first ha f of the game
for Oakland and in the third was found
for four hits, netting two tallies. He was
rather unsteady, however and after
opening the sixth with a base on bal a
Moskiman was substituted. Not a bit
was made off the doctor's delivery and not
a run was scored.
Borchers was effective in all but the
second inning, when he was jumped on for
three hits, resulting in Oakland s only
tallies H was this way: Hammond led
I off with a slow one to Leake and beat the
| ball out at first. He stole second and
rwent to third on Peeples' grounder to
! I.cake. Hanlon failed to hold the throw
and the kid was safe, only to be pinched
at second by Kent a moment later. John
son drove a pretty single to center, scor
ing Hammond, and after Hardin was as
sisted out at first by Anderson tallied on
Dunlevy's double to left. Russell flew to
Anderson, retiring the side.
San Jose made a brace of runs in the
third. ODea and Borchers led off with
singles and both scored on McGucken's
long double. After two men had gone out
.Anderson made another safe shot, but un
happlly settled matters by being nipped
at the plate by iMnilevy when he at
tempted to score on the hit. The last run
of the game was made by San Jose in
the fourth. Dalrymple was hit by a
pitched ball for the y,-cond time, went to
bi ''ond on a short passed ball and scored
on O'Dea's single to right. A lightning
i double play by Lange, Peeples and John
i son spoiled O'Dea"s hopes of getting
| around.
There w-as a period of deep suspense in
I the seventh inning, when Oakland filled
| the bases without a man being out. It
looked like a moral certainty that the
Dudes would at least tie the score, but
San Jose played ball as it has not played
before this peason, and Ewing's hopes of
making it three straight was blighted.
Hardin. thp first man up. was given a
pass. Dunlevy following with a nice sin
gle. Anderson's error of Moskiman's
grounder filled the bags. Donovan drove
the ball to ODea, who forced Hardin at
the plate, but all the cushions again had
occupants. Borchera did not lose his
nerve, however, although the Oakland
routers tried their best to rattle him,
and Schmeer struck out and Lange
i pushed a fly out to McGucken. In the
, eighth Hammond led off with a double
but npver got any further. Following are

SENATORS MEET DEFEAT.
SACRAMENTO. June 4.â Good, snappy
ball was played at Oak Park to-day, the
game resulting in a victory for the San
! Franciscos. The umpiring of Patsy Oa-
I hill was condemned by all" unprejudiced
j patrons. He favored the local team on
! every close play and made several glar
ing blunders in their favor.
Harvey was touched up for fourteen
j base hits and failed to retire a single
| man on strikes. The feature of the game
i was the batting of Swindells, who made
four safe hits out of four times at the
bat. Iberg, besides pitching a great
game, made three clean hits. The score:

WHITEWASH FOR WAT
SONVILLE.
SANTA CRT'Z, June 4.â Santa Cruz
â whitewashed Watsonville this afternoon
in the presence of a big crowd, several
hundred being from Watsonvllle, in one
of the best gani<-.-; played this season.
The game was distinguished by brilliant
plays and Donlin's masterly pitching.
Watsonville only got a man on third base
twice and each time he was put out
at the home plate. Watsonville was help
less before Donlin's mystifying curves.
He had such perfect control that he
struck them out at will. Donlin struck
out twelve men and Whalen one. Whalen
also pitched a good game, but was batted
effectually when runs were needed. He
had excellent support. Not a run was
made until the fourth inning, when Don
lin made a home run by driving the ball
into right field. In the fifth inning Santa
Cruz increased the score two more by
Clark reaching home on Kleiber's three
base hit, and Kleiber scoring on Whalen's
wild pitch. ->ot another run was made
after it. Santa Cruz played an errorless
game, while Watsonville made one error.

SEARCH FOR BONES
WILL BE CONTINUED
ALAMEDA. June 4.â Fritz Boehmer Jr.,
who brought to light the grewsome relics
of the murder supposed to have been
committed years ago in the old Bisset
place, will continue his search for further
evidences of the crime. He believes that
the treasure of the old Mexican, said to
have lost his life in a combat with the
mysterious Spaniard, is still buried be
neath the historical old building.
The statements of Mrs. Waltz of 2846
Van Buren street concerning her experi
encff the day after the wealthy Mexican
disappeared confirms his belief that the
treasure is still hidden near the ancient
building.
It is evident that the Spaniard murdered
the Mexican for his money, for there was
no other apparent reason why he should
have taken the old man's life, but Mrs.
Waltz believes that he did not get away
with the treasure. She thinks that ..e
was so badly frightened when he was
surprised by her and her girl friend the
day after the supposed homicide that he
fi.-d after burying the remains of his vic
tim In the cellar, without stopping to
hunt for coveted gold.
There is every indication that all the
secrets of the mysterious cellar have not
vet been unearthed. Strange marks and
stakes with peculiar inscriptions en
ccurage Mr. Boehmer In the belief that
he will uncover a veritable gold mine
before he gets through with the job. Much
bidden treasure has been found in that
section of the city. Large crowds visited
the place to-day, but the cellar where
the uncanny relics were found was care
fully guarded. The work of demolishing
the "building will be continued to-morrow,
and when the main section of the build
ing is reached a careful search will be
made for other evidences of old time
crimes. Mr Boehmer states that one old
lady who occupied the structure recently
complained of mysterious noises emanat
ing from the cellar. She was decidedly
superstitious and consulted a spirit medi
um. She was told that the ground under
th.6 structure was studded with the bones
of dead men. Soon afterward she va
cated the premises.

â  door. Several letters addressed to rela
! tives and friends were In the room. One
to the husband read:
"We have been too hasty and I was so
: lonesome here. I take all the blame. I
i was always your good wife. Ott<->, and I

QUEEN VICTORIA EULOGIZED.
Rev. Dr. Locke Discourses on Eng
land's Virtuous Monarch.
The announcement made during the past
week that evening service would be con
tinued in the Metropolitan Temple during
the present month by Rev. Dr. C'harleg
Edward Lock- of th<- Central Methodist
Church had its effect in so far that every
seat in th<- large building was taken as
arly as 6:3 m o'clock in the evening.
The subject upon which the reverend
gentleman discoursed was "Lessons From
the Life of England's Gracious Queen."
Text, i'salms xiv:34: "Righteousness ex
altetn a Nation." He said in part:
Kuskin said that great nations wrote their
autobiographies In three nxaunscrlpts-the book
Ir deeds, the book 1 I ihc.-lr words and the
book of tbetr artâ and then ventured to re
mark that the only quite trustworthy one of the
three waa the last. I am prepared to atrree
fully with this statement, provided th< sc three
bonks shall be bound in one volume, ami en
titled "Character." There can be no question
that a nation's place ami perpetuity will depend
upon tin- tru<- :i nÂ«i noble manhood of its citi
zenship. National Int.-grity depends upon the
h n ir of the Individual; and each Individual,
whether subject or niter, is contributing t.i or
tint; from the influence of his nation In
the world.
1 have desired to present to you the beau
tiful life of Queen Victoria because of the prac
tlcal lessons which may be derived from the
â  platlon of the living factors In the
world* busy activities. Men and women are
most recent revelations, and the study
of hiocnitihy Is the study oi Qod'a divinest
works. This matchless monarch has Jum be
:m octogenarian, and is now completing
the sixty-second year of her extraordinary
reign, having passed the record of her grand
father, George the Third, who ruled over Great
Britain for sixty years. In these days of
the founding of empires and the extension of
republics It will be particularly appropriate to
study carefully the life of Victoria, because
since the coronation of the child queen, more
than three score years ago. the English Gov
ernment has, In a remarkably Impressive man
ner, emphasized the poetic words of Israel
warrior king, "Righteousness exalteth a na
tion!"
From Victoria's birth, on May 24, 1819, In
Kensington- Palace, to the nlcht of June 20.
1*37 when she was declared queen, and on to
her marriage to Prince Albert, February 10.
1840, the young ruler's life was radiant with
peace and happiness, which continued with in
creasing sweetness anil joy for twenty years.
The noble prince was a gallant and tender
husband and father, and an example for Kng
llsh and American youth which has rarely
been equaled and never been surpassed. Nine
children blessed their happy home life. The
'â¢good prince" filled his delicate position as
husband of the Queen of England with an ap
preciation of his official relationships, which
attracted to himself the loving admiration of
the entire nation. He was a brilliant man of
strong mind, a born statesmanâ inch a
kjng"â a wise counselor to the Queen, who
never distastefully projected himself into the
counsels of, the nation: and, when in 1&61.
Prince Albert was suddenly gathered to his
fathers, not only was the broken-hearted Queen
enveloped In a. dark shadow from which she
never emerged, and the whole English nation
prostrated in overwhelming grief, but the
Christian world mourned the loss of one of the
superbest Christian noblemen of the most ex
quisite type which this old, sinful world has
ever known. No one has taken his place.
Prince Albert is the Ideal Christian man.
Marvelous and unprecedented have been the
achievements of these sixty-two years. What
epochs have been turned! What mighty men
have been budded! At her coronation George
Stephenson was perfecting his railroad: Wheat
stone was experimenting with electricity; Dick
ens was publishing "Oliver Twist"; Carlyle and
Browning and Thackeray were already dis
tinguished; Tennyson was having a favorable
introduction; Father Matthew was preaching
total abstinence to the Irish people: Gladstone
had been In Parliament live years and Disraeli
had just made his Inauspicious maiden speech;
Macaulay was In India and Rowland Hill was
working out his plan for cheap postage.
As the decades advanced to this galaxy of
greatnrss were added Wellington and Havelock
and Livingstone and Palmerston. Derby and
Peel and Bright. Salisbury and Richard Cob
den. Then there were Southey and Campbell
and Tom Moore. Swinburne and Rossetti, Jean
Ingelow, and Wordsworth. Darwin and Huxley
and Spencer and Tyndall, and many other
bright luminaries in the political and intellec
tual and religious firmament.
There have been unexampled triumphs! Vic
tories for science, for popular education and
for personal freedom. The corn laws were
abolished; the ballot was adopted; the aboli
tion of purchase in the army; the extinction of
the Irish state church; the treaty of Berlin;
the establishment of free and universal educa
tion; the freedom of the universities; the splen
did reform of household suffrage, and the sub
stantial disappearance of sectarian and de
nominational antagonisms. Truly this Victor
lan reign has been a period of victories for a
broader and brighter civilization. "Righteous
ness exalteth a nation!"
The whole trend of Queen Victoria's reign
has been toward the universal peace which
shall some day burst In gladness over the whole
earth. When, at the Queen's Jubilee, in ISS7.
the Governor of the Colony Victoria asked the
Queen to select a passage of scripture to be
placed in a copy of the New Testament, which
was to be presented to all the children who
participated In the exercises of jubilee day, her
Majesty wrote: "On earth peace, good will to
ward men." A grateful American people will
never forget the almost disastrous Trent epi
sode, which, at the breaking out of our civil
war would have Involved us in bitter struggle
with Great Britain, had It not been averted by
the peace-loving Queen, assisted by amiable
Prince Albert, who a few weeks later came
to the mountain of his translation.
The American people love Victoria and Join
with the great English people In the reverent
prayer. "God Save the Queen." Victoria, queen
by the grace of God. has contributed vast In
fluence toward the solution of the problems of
the ages. God has mightily blessed and used i
the English people, and they will continue to
be a strong arm of power as they follow the
example and spirit of their gracious monarch.
Victoria has her own incomparable place among
the queens of history. There were Deborah
warlike and trustful: Esther, beautiful and
brave; Semlramts. brilliant and ostentatious;
Zenobia, regal and handsome; Elizabeth, mas
culine and firm; Mary, cruel and heartless; but
It remained for thin century to produce a noble
lady who combined In herself the host of all
who had preceded her, and, crowned with divine '
approval, to win for herself an honored place
unapproached by all royal predecessors. The
secret of her personal magnificence and su
premacy, and the reason of the power of Great
Britain to-day, Is that "Righteousness exalteth :
a nation." May the American people learn well
this simple lesson In these days of our expand
ing- power and opportunities!
EDITOR GREENBLATT
LAYS DOWN HIS PEN
Has Been Chief of Staff of the
California Demokrat for
Twenty Years,
After twenty years' active service M.
Greenblatt yesterday handed in his resig
nation as editor-in-chief of the California
Demokrat, the leading German daily of
the Pacific coast.
Since Mr. Greenblatt took up his pen as
editor of the German paper he has made
a host of friends, not only in San Fran-
M. GREENBLATT.
Cisco, but in all the coast States, and his
loss will be felt by all the readers of the
paper. A few months ago Mr. Greenblatt
was stricken with apoplexy while work
ing at his desk. A week ago he was pro
nounced convalescent, though not wholly
cured, and he then made up his mind that
the work was too great a strain on his
weakened constitution. Yesterday he re
turned to this city and handed in his res
ignation, but It was only after he bad
fully presented the case to the manage
mttn't that it was accepted.
In politics Mr. Greenblatt has been one
of the Democratic leaders of the State.
Lapt year he was the Democratic candi
date for Treasurer and was defeated by a
small majority. At present he hoi is the
office of notary public, and will contlnuo
to reside in this city and devote his time
during business hours to this office.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, JUNE 5, 1899.
SENATOR SCOTT
IS HERE FOR
HEALTH ALONE
Taboos Politicsâ Will
Not Talk of Quay.
TWO KINDS OF PRECEDENTS
THE PENNSYLVANIA!*, HE SAYS,
HAS MANY FBIENDS.
Thinks the Filipino Should Be Erad
icated From the Domestic Econ
omy of United States and
His Country Opened.
Senator N. E. Scott, newly elected from
West Virginia, arrived at the Palace Ho
tel yesterday. Mr. Scott comes Into the
"West "for health, for health alone and
for no political reason." He so stated
last evening when approached with ques
tions as to the numerous peculiar politi
cal problems that the next Congress will
have to solve. Concerning the chances that
Matthew Quay, appointed to the Sen
ate by the Governor of Pennsylvania,
will have to be seated. Senator Scott had
less to say than upon any other topic.
"I cannot be interviewed upon that
point." said he. "In fact I am a new Sen
ator, and am really not prepared to say
anything at all in connection with that
question.
"You must ri'mcmhf-r, however, that
Mr. Quay has a great many friends -
more, perhaps, than any man who has
<>vor been to the Senate, and they am
strong friends. You know as much about
these things as I do and will have to fig
ure your own answer out. But in doing
so you must remember that Mr. Quay
will have a great many friends in "Wash
ington. Besides he has made a reputa
tion a? a proper representative."
Askt d if indications pointed to the seat
ing of Mr. Quay. Senator Scott avoided
a direct answer. "He has many friends,"
he reiterated, "and T think it likely that
we will follow precedent."
"By following precedent. Senator, you
mean that Mr. Quay will probably not be ;
seated? The precedent established is
against his chances."
"Ah, but you must remember that there
was another precedent established before
that. What we really ought to do in the
Philippines is subjugate the natives and
tht-n do the best we can with them."
Senator Scott abruptly changed the. sub
ject, nor could questioning bring him b;n-k
to the question of Quay ami its bearing
upon the hope that is still held out to Dan
Burns that he will one day occupy a chair
and a place on the roll call of the United
States Senate.
Concerning the Philippines and the rath
er expensive unpleasantness just now at
tached thereto, he was quite willing to
talk. Senattr Scott thinks the unpleas
antness and the expense should be con
tinued, though he has not as yet outlined
a plan of action in his mind's eye to follow
after It.
Concerning Mr. Quay and Mr. Hums,
however. Senator Scott merely thinks that
Mr. Quay has "many friends" and that
there have been "other" precedents.
ENDS IN A DRAW.
Call of Time Saves the Pacific Crick
eters From Defeat at Alameda
Grounds.
The Pacific eleven met the Alameda
cricket team yesterday for the second
time this season and succeeded in draw
ing the match. George Theobald, the Pa
cific captain, won the toss and sent Ala
meda to the bat. After four wickets had
fallen J. J. Moriarty and F. Croll pot to
gether and put on nenrly a hundred runs
between them before F. Croll waa caught
by Simmonds, having made 49. "With Jive,
wickets down for 140 runs, J. J. Moriarty
called the innings and the Pacifies went to
the bat. J. Myers scored 27 and F. Sewell
29, and only nine wickets having fallen at
the call of time the game ended in a draw.
The Pacifies have obtained a useful man
in L. H. Sandilands. who is tall and
smothers many dangerous balls. \lo also
bowled quite successfully, taking three
wickets for 34 runs. J. J. Moriarty and
F. Croll were both lucky at the bat. Their
wickets should have fallen when they had
scored about ten runs apiece. The fell
score Is given herewith:

GAVE SOUND ADVICE
TO PUBLIC SERVANTS
Rev. Frederick C. Leo of the California
Street Methodist Episcopal Church deliv
ered a stirring sermon on "The Cry of
Boodle" last evening b.-fore a large con
gregation. He warned the Board of Super
visors against a wave of public indigna
tion which would follow the granting of
any corporation franchises and implored
them to keep their "hands clean ami th.-ir
hearts pun" when approached with
boodle. In part it was as follows:
If I should change the celebrated saying; of
Carlyle I would put It thus: "The United
States is composed of over 70,000,000 of people,
mostly foolsâ t.. he found principally !n our
large cities." When will the voters ;in<l tax
payers In our great American municipalities
learn wisdom and depart from folly? The cry
of "boodle" and bribery will ever be beard in
the land just so lons as the cities put it within
the power of their Hoards of Aldermen or Su
pervisors ti> vote away valuable franchises for
which the city receives nothing in return. What
the Aldermen or Supervisors receiveâ as Kip
ling saysâ "That's another story."
Do I choree our Sueprvisors with having
been "boodleized ?" No. Must emphatically,
No! Ho I insinuate that they can be bribed or
bouKht? Again I say no. I believe there are
gentlemen upÂ«Â«n our Board of Supervisors who
are Just as honest and as truthful aeâ asâ
Borne of us preachers (and that's nut saying
much}â Just as anxious to do the right thing
as I am. Look out for the man that is always
charging others with rascality. He will bear
watching himself. While, then, I do not cry
"boodle, or in any way question the charac
ter Or conduct of these men, yet I say to OUT
honorable Board <>f Supervisors: "Gentlemen,
take heeil and In-war.' how you vote awa] any
franchise i>r. .-v i < ]â¢-. i for in our new charter. Give
away any privilege, grant any franehi
which our new city charter provides that the
municipality shall receive valuable cons
Uon, and never to y,.ur dylnjj day can you
make the public believe that you did so from
uninterested motives. You may be as innocent
as angels, but you will never succeed in mak
ing the city of Saji Francisco believe that
you went out of office with "clean hands and
imre hearts." With only a few months before
our new charter takes effectâ why any unsea
sonable or unreasonable haste?.' With every
thing to lose and nothing to gain, why should
any Question so vital to all the futur" life of
our noble and crowing city be "railroaded"
through? Our new charter, one of the best
and In many ways the most advanced charter
Of any city In the Union, was drawn up and
adopted to cover and control these very ques
tions.

Now. ii has lÂ»'<-n figured out in some

THE SUPERVISORIAL SITUATION.
MAYOR PHELAN and the minority members of ths Board of
Supervisors have begun a campaign to force the gas com
pany to establish a rate of SI 35 a thousand feet and to sac
rifice a material part of the money which the company claims
from the city. Mnyoi Phelan does not intend to call a meeting of
the Supervisors until the gas company comes to terms. Under the
law the Mayor need not call a meeting of the Supervisors until the
first Monday in July. That interesting fact was established when
the Market-street Railway Company was attempting to consum
mate its gigantic theft of streets and franchises.
Mayor Phelan will now use his power to force the gas com
pany to terms and prevent the long litigation which inevitably
must result from the present controversy. The Mayor and his mi
nority supporters understand perfectly that the menace of the rail
road has been destroyed. The gps company has fought, however,
with as much bitterness and with something more of success than
the railroad. The Mayor and his ailies intend, therefore, to tuin
their attention to this corporation.
At a meeting held on Saturday these officials decided to maka
a definite offer of compromise to the gas company, which has a
claim of $189,000 against the city and demands a current rate cf
$1 60 for gas. The Mayor and the minority Supervisors will insist
that th? gas company scale $50,000 from its claim against the
city and accept a rate of $1 35 for all future demands, not only to
the municipality, but to all private consumers If the corporation
c it must sacrifice the $189,000
which it claims from the city and take its chances of victory in
th<* contest which is now on. The Mayor seems to have the whip
hand, as he need not call a meeting of the Board of Supervisors un
til after it is too late to pay the gas bills r.s provided by law.
such transfer. If no gas Mils are ap
proved an Injunction against such r>
transfer would not lie. Such, at least.
is the way the situation appears to the
minority. This explains the whiphand
they feel they have and the reason for
delaying a meeting. To maintain the
legal effect of such a situation it is not
necessary. it is contended, to delay a ,
meeting until July. It a meeting were
held a little after the 15th. inst. action on |
the Mayor's veto could not be had until
after the end of the fiscal year. The dan- t
ger of a transfer of the street light fund j
is a club with which; it is thought, the '
gas company can be Induced to compro
mise.
The pas company wants mainly a
chance to pet Into court since it is known
that the Mayor will not approve its bills.
Tt has, proposed to accept payment at the
$1 i" rate if the way is left open for it
t' sue the city for the rest. This is what
the minority propose to deny as far as
possible.
At the Saturday caucus it was agreed .
by Mayor Phelan and the minority that
the pas bills against the city, which will
be increased by 535.100 or so during June;
would be paid i!" 'he compunv accepted
the terms there improved. These were
that payment for all gas consumed
should lie paid for at the rate of
(136 a thousand feet Instead of the $1 flO
claimed by the company and the $1 10
asserted by the mlnoritv; that the rate I
for street lamps be out from 11 cents per
night to '.* cents, and that the electric
light bills be reduced 1!.". per cent. It is
estimated that these reductions would
i take about $50,000 off the J159.000 now
claimed. This Is the proposition now
ready for gas people, and on its ac
ceptance depends Mayor Phelan's call for
a meeting of the Board of Supervisors.
This 16 .-aid to be ihe ultimatum of the
"M and â the Mayor and the
i minority.
Supervisor Kalben stands boldly by the
pas company, though he has apparently ;
, fully left the majority on franchise propo- j
i s'.tions. He wants a meeting of the j
board, and will doubtless support any
: effort to force one. When asked yester- j
day his opinion of the proposed delay by !
the Mayor in calling a meeting, he said. j
"I am not in favor of delay a? all. and !
I don't see what is to be gained by it. j
' I believe the board ought to go right alone [
and attend to its work. There is a great
amount of routine business that ought to j
be done. Merchants' and other bills should !
I (>â¢ paid: there will be petitions to act on i
and so forth, and If no meeting were held \
until July it would inconvenience many j
people and make them angry. There Is i
no danger of. franchises being passed j
Perhaps the minority is a little afraid of j
mi . but I don't think franchises are the i
â  reason. It looks to me like a scheme to J
: rob the pas company. I don't see any i
call for plundering a corporation. If no
meeting is called I propose to find out
this week what the reason really is."
Supervisor/ rrault declined to discuss
the situation at any length on the plea
that it was agreed at the caucus that the
proceedings and plan should not be dis
cussed. What he was willing to say was
this: "I cannot say definitely, but I think
there is a strong probability that there
will be no meeting of the Board of Super
visors this month. I don't think there is
any danger of any franchises being passed
ii a meeting were held, and that will not
bo the reason for any delay in calling ?
n.eeting. That was not what was dis
cussed at the caucus yesterday."
Supervisor Deasy last nipht admitted
that The Call's knowledge of the plans of
the minority was substantially com
plete.
"We are firm in our resolution." he
said, "to prevent the pending bills of thÂ»
company from being paid .out of funds
i now in the treasury unless it will acceni
the compromise of a rate of $135. a re
duction of 2 cents on street lamps and i
reduction of 25 per cent on the city's
electric light bills. 1 am sure we will
agree to no other terms. The best thin*
the company can do is to accept our
terms. If it does not we may not meet
until July, the. light fund will be trans
ferred and then there will be a law suit..
Then we will be able to go into all the
details of the company's business, includ
ing the cost of the gas. its watered stock
and so on. I do not think they will care
to face that. If the company would ac
cept ire compromise there would be :t
meeting soon and its bills would be paid
We show that we are willing to meet
them half. way in a compromise. I cer
tainly am. I do not believe in confiscat
ing any corporation's property, but cor
porations should be forced to treat the
city right, and we have long been Having
too much for gas and water, I believe
V. X, to be a fair rate.
"I cannot Bay anything definite as to
the prospects of a meeting of the board.
The merchants' bills and other matters
should be attended to and probably will
be. There will be no meeting next' Mon
day or the Monday following. We are
doing and will do what We think to be
for the best interests of the city. While
I don't think that there is any danger of
any franchises being passed, we want to
keep on the safe side of that also. It
is a satisfaction to the minority to know
that we have all the respectable elements
of the city with us. â  â 
"Then* is no danger of ' the majority
forcing a meeting. The Mayor's attor
neys have thoroughly investigated the

I hope that by the last of this â veek, certainly not later than next

office lam pledged to the support of no man. and when the matter comes

question and decided that any meeting
they might bold without the board being
convoked by the Mayor would be illegal.
i 'l'-rk Russell takes the same view. I
don'; believe that any franchises what
ever should be granted until the new
charter, goes Into effect."
Supervisor Aigeltinger cares nothing
whether the board meets or not. He said
! last evening :
"1 will not vote upon any franchises
until these bribery charges' are cleared
up. I <-iin in favor of acting according to
the wishes of the Merchants' Association.
it will be remembered that that, was my
original proposition. 1 do not know
whether we will have a meeting to-mor
row or not, but if we do I am in favor
of only transacting such business as the
Interests of the city demand (but under
no cm umstances would I vote on the
franchise question. So far as I am per
sonally cone riled 1 don't care whether
we ever have another meeting of the
board. In view of the unjust abuse that
has b^-n heaped on me."
Supervisor Holland believes the board
should have been given a chance to pass
the gas bills.
"I am greatly surprised," he said. "U

CHINATOWN REEKING
WITH VICE AND SIN
Rev. W. E. Dugan, in a prelude to his
sermon at the Stewart Memorial Church,
Guerrero streets, last evening, spoke on
"Chinatown Iniquities." In part he said:
Fair San Francisco, what glorious things may
be said of thee; yet thou hast a Mack- spot in
the awful corruptions of Chinatown. The sink
holes of vice and maelstroms of, corruption In
this dark portion of the city are vile almost
beyond the Imagination of vicious devils There
arc In Chinatown about ISO Iron-Rated prisons,
where women and children are owned and con
trolled as so many cattle.
San KYanclsco in the only place on the face
of God's great earth where there Is an insti
tution every member of which must be the
owner of a house of 111 fame. Nor In Hong
kong, darkest India, Africa or China do we
find Such a vile firm organized for malicious
business, but San Francisco has-: added this
crimson blot to her "already bedraggled ban
ner of political crime and shame."
Can we expect prosperity and God's blessing
as long as this heathenism reigns in our midst?
The heathenism of the Filipino. In whose behalf
we are carrying on a great and expensive war,
is not to be compared to the heathenism of our
Chinatown. God speed the day when It Bhall
be wiped from the glorious sunset city.

Will Garry War Into

Camp.
Plans Formed to Oust the
Southern Pacific
Usurper.
Citizens and property owners of thÂ»Â»
Mission are no longer content to act on
the defensive- against the Southern Pa
cific and the Market Street Railway. They
have gathered the first fruits of organiza
tion in their recent victory over the "as
sociated villainies," and see the value of
an aggressivajjolicy. X<>i content to sit
Idly on the laurels won during the past
Â«â â¢â¢*-!<. they now propose to carry the war
into the enemy's country and wrest from
'he usurpers the rights stolen from the
people.
Filled with this spirit and elated with
the consciousness of work well done in
their recent decisive preliminary skirmish
with the railroad and the "boodle seven." j
since disrupted, nearly 2<X) representatives ,
<>f the district met yesterday afternoon
;it Mangels Hall. Twenty-fourth ami '
Kolsuni streets, to hear the reports of .
their committees and decide upon plans
fur tin- campaign that will not end until
every public right invaded has been sur
rendered id tlie people.
The session was a lively olio, and be
fore it dosed the methods to lie pursued
in the onslaught against the grab-all
tendency of the Southern Pacific Com
pany had been fully determined. Having
defeated the attempt of the niilroad to
push through the "double track'" fran
chise, it was the sense of the members
present that the company's usurpation of
the right of way over the single track
steam line from Sixteenth street to
Twenty-fifth, should be brought to the
attention of the courts, with a view to
ousting the company. As a preliminary
step, a committee was appointed to pre- i
sent the petition to the Supervisors call- .
Ing upon their, to Instruct the District At- I
torney to take action necessary to oust
the company from its unlawful holding.
The meeting was called to order by T.
('.. Blevin. president of the Mission and
Potrero Improvement Â«'!ub. tinder the
auspices of Which organization it had
!,.-..i called. The minutes of the memor
able meeting of Sunday. May 2<. were
read and approved, and the following pre- j
amble and resolutions, submitted by A.
B. Magulre, were read and adopted:
Whereas, It Is quite evident from recent
events that th" Southern Pacific Company
is determined to hold fast its crip on the
present steam line route through the heart
of the city; and.
Whereas. The time has romp for the peo
ple to throw oft the patient submission that
has been extended toward the Southern
Pacific Company, and are resolved, from
now on to work strenuously for the removal
of the tracks from their present route ami
to force the completion of the hay shore
line or take steps for the forfeiture of said
allied franchise: and.
Whereas, The Merchant? Association wart
organized to advance the good and welfare
of the city; and.
Whereas. The time has now come for the
association to make the most decisive move,
together with the united Dress and the peo
ple, that has been presented to them since
the creation of the association: therefore â¢
Resolved, That we respectfully request
their hearty co-operation in our legitimate
efforts to rid the city of this nuisance to
our people and detriment to real estate in
our section of the city. He it further
Resolved, That a committee of ten citizens
i â â  appointed with full power to act to wait
on the Board of Supervisors and board of
director" â â ' the Merchants' Association to
secure their assistance in our efforts to rid
the city of this terriblÂ» nulÂ«ance: to life, limb
and property: also to visit the several polit
ical conventions about to convene to secure
a plank In their respective platforms calling
for a removal at an early date of the steam
tracks from the residence portion of the
city.
A resolution Introduced by Gustave
Bchnee was adopted, congratulating
Mayor Phelan for the manner In which he
balked the majority of the Supervisors in
their efforts to alienate the rights of the
People; and also assuring the minority
ol the hoard of the gratitude of the people
of the Mission. A similar resolution
thanking the press oi the dty \v;is also
adopt< d.
I. Harrington nrnvd that a rnmmilifp
ni tiv^ be appointed to co-operate with a
similar committee appointed Saturday
evening by the Federated Mission lm
provenK-nt ciub to present a resolution to
the Hoard of Supervisors requesting that
body to order the District Attorney to
commence proceedings against me
Southern Pacific for the abatement of the
nuisance it maintained in the single
track road.
Secretary E. D. Sullivan counseled
moderation.
"And I." exclaimed Gustave Schnee.
"believe In radical measures. 1 believe we
should begin proceedings to abate this
nuisance. That is the only way you will
get the Southern Pacific rf) go around ny
the bay shore line. Leniency! There is
nothing in it. They don'l show you any.
In fact, I would suggest that thy people
go to work and tear up* the tracks over
the crossing!) right now. Radical
measures are the oniy things that will
bring the railroad to terms. You can't
expect to get anything out of Hunting
ton. Ask him a favor and he'll squeeze
you to the end."
The chair then named the committees
provided for as follows:
Committee of Tenâ A. B. Maguire, Will
iam Watson. George ''enter. J. J. Clarke,
George Walcom, Gustave Schnee. R. I.
Coffey J. P. Tuohey, John Foppiana and
J. E. Behan.
Committee fif Fiveâ P. Harrington. Max
Popper. E. I). Sullivan, Stephen Byrne
and George Center.
William Watson, a member of th<> com
mittee appointed by the Federated Mis
sion Clubs, was called upon to rehears'- a
conversation h" had had with Henry
Lynch of the Market Street Railway Com
pany in reference to the Southern Pa
cific's steam line through the Mission. He
said Lynch told him that the company
intended to hold its right of way there as
long as it lasted.
' "I asked him." continued Mr. Watson,
"why they didn't build the bay shore line
and he said the tunnels bothered them. I
told him that In the thirty-three years I
had been waiting for relief the company
had built to New Orleans, the whole
length of California, crossed Oregon and
gone into Washington, and it was mighty
strange that It could not build four miles
of road to the bay shore."
The meeting then adjourned subject to
the call of the chair.
A Brutal Husband.

With His Clothing Ablaze tde Brave
Man Throws the Burning Stove
Through an Opan

August Pouchot, floor-walker in San
born, Vail .v- Co.'a store on Mar
ket street, was severely burned about the
face and hands last evening- by the ex
plosion of a coal oil stove. The acci
dent happened at his home, .311 Octavia
street.
The unfortunate man's wife was pre
paring the evening meal when she dis
covered that the oil in the stove was
ablaze. She quickly summoned her hus
band, who attempted to extinguish the
flames . by throwing a blanket over the
stove. A few seconds later the explosion
occucfed. the burning oil enveloping
Poucnot and Betting fire to his clothing.
With rare presence of mind Pouchoi
picked up a heavy blanket which his wife
had provided and wrapped it around his
body. He then picked up the stove,
which was covered with burning oil, and
hurled it through an open window into
the street.
As the carpet had caught fire from the
burning oil. Mrs. Pour-hot, fearing that
the house was in danger of being de
stroyed, ran to the corner of Oak and
Oetavia streets, where she caused an
alarm to be sent in from box 83. The
Dearest engine quickly responded and

ceiving Hospital, where his burns were
dressed by Assistant Police Surgeon Tor

Father Otis' Sermon.
Rev. Father Callanan was the celebrant
at the 10:30 mass in St. Mary's Church
yesterday morning. After mass there
was a procession of the Blessed Sacra
ment, Rev. Father Otis preached the
sermon in the morning. He took up the
text from the epistles of the day. the
words: "In this we have known the char
ity of God. because He hath laid down His
life for us. and we ought to lay down
our lives for the brethren." In substance
lie said:
The commandment of our blessed I^ord that
we should love one another as hr- has i.,ved us
is put before us very plainly in these words of
St. John; <mr lives are asked for as a proof
of our love. I*>w is the first, the Ki*at com
mandment, and the fuel that keeps the flame
alive In r hearts Is the deeds of charity
shown toward our fellowmen. As our love for
(iod increases, so does our love for man la
crease. The manifestation of love for our fel
lowraen is the standard b- which all truth is
measured nowadays. It attracts the attention
ami leads one to inquire What prompts such
sacrifices, it disarms criticism, cuts it in
twain, as the questioning of the priests and
Pharisees was t n rr-.'.i itsi.i^ by the plain state
ment of the man who had been blind, but was
healed by our Lord "Whether he tV a sinner
or no. I know not; but this I know, whereas,
1 was blind and now 1 Bee." The world at lari<e
may be unfamiliar with and slow to grasp
doctrines of faith, but It is keen and quick
In distinguishing between real, genuine char
ity and the sham virtue, the superficial pre
tended charity, so much practiced in our dayâ
the charity that causes the tongue to drop
HAS CHARGE OF THE
CHURCH OF THE ADVENT
The REV. HERBERT PARRISH, Who
Preached His First Sermon in a
New Field Yesterday.
REV. HERBERT PARRISH. who resigned from St. Mary's the Virgin
to accept the pastorate of the Church of the Advent, corner Eleventh
and Market streets, made vacant by the promotion of Archdeacon
Emery, preached his initial sermon to the congregation in his new
field of labor last night and made a very favorable impression.
Dr. Parrish was born in Grand Rapids, Mich., in 1868. He is the son
of Judge Parrish of the Superior Court of that State and always a prominent
churchman. He was educated at Trinity College. Hartford, and graduated
from that institution with high honors. He then entered the General Theo
logical Seminary of New York, where he remained three years, and became
after his ordination deacon's assistant of old St. Peter's, a church where
Washington was an attendant during his first term as President. Here he re
mained for a year, when he was advanced to thf priesthood by Bishop Whit
taker and at once became curate of St. Clements, from whence he received
the call to San Francisco a year ago. Mr. Parrish brings to the pulpit of the
Advent an eloquence quite uncommon and an enthusiasm which assures his
future success.
