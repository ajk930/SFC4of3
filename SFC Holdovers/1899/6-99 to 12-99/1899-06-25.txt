ROOSEVELT WELCOMED TO
THE GREAT WEST.
ROUGH RIDERS GREET THEIR CHIEF.
> AST LAS VEGAS, X. M., June
i 24. â Thi reception committee of
' citizens and Rough Riders,
I / headed by Governor 'Her".
ciimfrinan â nmiimore. Mayor
Coors, Colonel Brodie and Captain !
Llewellyn) met Governor Roosevelt at
Wagon Mound at 11:55 this morning.
At Raton, the first town across the
Colorado line, the Governor was pre
sented with a floral arch composed of
roses and carnations, with a .back
ground of Bmilax, and a floral swinging
door. At Sprinerer he was presented
with a floral wreath.
The meeting at Wagon Mound be
tween Colonel _ Roosevelt and his old
comrades in arms was most cordial. To
Colonel Brodie he said: "I'm delighted
to see you ; glad to be here."
To other Rough Riders who pressed
around him to shake his hand and
whom he immediately recognized his
â tings were: "How are you. old
man? Mighty glad to see you. Where's
Jack Green way?" "Does me good to
p<-e you" and "Delighted to be with
you." â¢
Th" meeting between Governor
TJoosevelt and Governor Otero was
both dignified and cordial. He shook
ex-Governor Adams of Colorado by the
hand heartily, and later paid him a
graceful compliment in referring to the
First Colorado Regiment^ Baying: "I'm
proud of every man in that regiment
and wish every one of Uncle Sam's sol
diers was as brave."
The school children at Wagon Mound
rr.Tthered at the depot and sang "My
Native Country," and th Governorsang
with them. He was cheered all along
â he line, at every station, and did not
/nrget to acknowledge the slightest
courtesy extended him.
"The first man I recognized from the
train was Captain Luna,'.' said the
Governor, as he stood on the end of the
car and talked, with the members of
his command and with them called up
incidents of the Cuban campaign, all
of a humorous nature.
The time coming from Wagon Mound
to Las Vegas was spent by the Gov
ernor in making the acquaintance of
the friends and the members of the
National Guard, and he kept up a con
stant conversation with the members
of the party in Vice President Mor
ton's car until he was apprised of the
fact that luncheon was awaiting him.
After luncheon the Governor put on
his Rough Rider uniform and then pro
ceeded to the observatory of the car,
where the Rough Riders and the com
mittees were. On entering he re
marked, "Now I feel just like saying,
â Scatter out and go after them liko
hell.' " This sally, and his appear
ance, called forth hearty cheers from
those in the car.
On observing his change from citi
zens' clothes to the Rough Riders' cog
'ume Lieutenant Devereux said, "He
oks just like the same old thing," to
which Teddy immediately retorted with
a laugh, "It is destructive of all dis
r pllne to allude to the 'colonel' as 'the
sume old thing.' "
Governor Roosevelt and Devereux
talked together for ten minutes, calling
up reminiscences of the old campaign
fit Montauk Point, and answering mu
tual inquiries as to individual mem
bers of the regiment. In conversing
with Governor Otero Governor Roose
velt, in the course of his remarks, re
ferred to the Just claims of New Mex
ico for statehood, and put himself on
record as follows:
I'm for New Mexico for statehood,
and am ready to go to Washington at
any time and push the claims of New
Mexico," and then spoke to the effect
that a Territory that can furnish such
fighters as he commanded in Cuba was

at convenient places.
The business meeting of the Rough
Riders Regimental Association was
held in the Duncan Opera House, and '
owing to the absence of Secretary Car- j
tor of Prescott, Lieutenant William E. j
Dame of Santa Fe was chosen secre- ;
tary pro tern. An nncross of welcome
( ,n l>eha!f of the citizens ot Las Vegas j
was made by A. A. Jones, a prominent
attorney of this place. He said in con
clusion :
"We are more than grateful to have
assembled here from the various States â 
and Territories this happy throng who j
join us in extending to you our hoe- j
pitality, love and affection."
Colonel Roosevelt responded as fol
lows, his remarks at times being en- j
thusiaetically applauded:
Ju*t at this time I would not have left ;
New York State for any purpose save to at
tend the reunion of my old regiment, and
for that purpose I would have gone to Alaska
or anywhere else, for the bond that unites
us one to another Is as close as any bond of I
human friendship can be. It was our good j
fortune to be among those accepted when the j
country called to arms a yrar aÂ«o last spring.

By way of variety in the out- \

Idaho cnnounces that he has
grown weary of hearing his acts
critic/zed by the wives of miners,

WALLACE, Idaho, June 24.â
The State authorities and mi
litia .ire beginning to realize
that their infamous conduct
is becoming known to the
American people, in spite of the press
censorship and the efforts of the mine
owners' organ to suppress the truth,
and with that knowledge comes the
realization that they will not be per
mitted much longer to oppress, impris
on and maltreat innocent men or to
use the power of the United States
army to drive from this State the
friends of organized labor. Realizing
that th< ir arbitrary reign must soon
terminate, in their desperation they
are resorting to the most abominable
practices in a last effort to exterminate
unionism and to convict men without
regard to their guilt r>r innocence.
Not satisfied with packing the Grand
Jury with Coroner's deputies and spot
ters in the employ of the Bunker Hill
Company, they have now inaugurated
a policy of arresting and confining in
the "bull pen" any men whom they
think might be of service to the de
fense. This was the reason for the ar
rest of Thomas Heney yesterday. He
is one of the most respected citizens of
Shoshone County and was not at the
scene of the riot, but he was a friend
of organized labor and might have en
deavored to assist those he believed to
be innocent of crime who are re
strained of their liberty. The entire
community is indignant over the out
rage, but no man dares to give expres
sion to his feelings publicly. Free
speech has been a thing of the past in

DREYFUS IS
NEAR FRANCE
It Is Thought He Will
Reach Brest on Sunday
Evening,
GENERAL GALLIFET, th* New French
Minister of War.
BKKST. France, June 24.â Captain Dreyfus will not arrive here until
Sunday evening at the earliest. This was the latest news that was
circulated in Brest on the receipt of the announcement that the
cruiser Sfax had passed Madeira yesterday. The population of the
rity continues to maintain the calmest mood imaginable.
Red posters displayed at various points heralded a meeting of Dreyfusites
to-nipht in the Hall de Venice, the biggest dancing hail in Brest, situated in
the vicinity of the arsenal. The demonstration was organized by Socialists
and was attended hy 1200 persons, the audience consisting mainly of Social
ists and anarchists, together with a few detectives.
The speakers, among whom were most of the Socialist leaders, addressed
the audience from a balcony. They attacked militarism and reaction. The
audience enthusiastically cheered all reference to Dreyfus. Zola and Pic
quart. A couple of individuals who cried "A has .luifs!" were promptly
hustled out, hut otherwise the meeting was perfectly calm and the squads
of police who were stationed in the adjacent streets had absolutely nothing
to do. The speakers called upon their hearers to assemble upon the arrival
o-f Dreyfus, in order to defend liberty and Justice. The audience dispersed
with cries of "Vive social revolution!" "Viye Zola!" and "Vive Picquart!"
Some shouts of "Vive anarchic!" were heard.
The representative of the Associated Press saw M. Schlron, the leader nf
the Brest Socialists, who said in the course of his conversation: "We intend
to he present at the landing of Dreyfus, but we do not propose to make any
demonstration. We shall he perfectly orderly and quiet, unless the reaction
aries attempt to make a demonstration apainst Dreyfus. In that case we
shall defend the cause o-f liberty and justice."
This means that if the anti-revisionists attempt a demonstration there
Will be broken heads in Brest when Dreyfus is landed. The military author
ities are still reticent as to the arrangements made, and it is evidently their
desire to conceal the arrival of the prisoner of Devils Island until he shall
have been safely removed to Rennes, where there is more reason to fear dis
cords than there is here.

Archbishop Ireland Be-
lieves It IsSafe From
Assaults Within.
Special Cable to The Call and the New York
Hrralri. Copyrighted, 15.., by James Gor
don Bennett.
PARIS, June 24.â Archbishop Ireland
left the Gare dv Nord to-day for
Calais, on his way to London, with
Bishop Ogernian, and will sail for New
York on July IL' or 14. Before leaving
the Herald correspondent interviewed
him and asked, "How does the political
situation here impress you? Not as
a warm friend of France â every one
knows that you are that â not even as
an ecclesiastic, but simply as an
American?"
"Well, if I understand aright your
question," he replied, "you would like
to know how French political life, as a
whole, presents itself to me as an
American? In the first place, in spite
of all superficial indications to which
a foreigner might be inclined to at
tach undue importance, the republic
seems to have become firmly estab
lished in France.
"It is possible that democratic ideas
are not absolutely welcomed by every
class of the French, but they are cer
tainly dear to the vast majority of the
people and openly opposed by but an
infinitesimal few. They have thrust
down roots deep into the soil, and are
thriving vigorously and healthfully.
It seems to me that events last week
furnish a most impressive illustration
of this. Although a political crisis has
been In course for some time, aJthough
there has been no government for days
although the critical moment was
drawing near for the settlement of a
judicial question that has distracted
the nation close upon two years, the
current of public business flowed unin
terruptedly.
"This proves that whatever disturb
ances may manifest themselves are
merely bubbles on the surface. It
demonstrates that the people have
confidence In the virtue of the repub
lican regime, and that also, as regards
the Dreyfus affair, justice will be done,
and the vordict at Rennes will be re
ceived with satisfaction and accepted
loyally.
"I will say that my observations of
French political institutions haw-, giv^n
me an even greater admiration than
before for the wisdom of our own !
American constitution. I realize bet- i
ter than ever how strongly and wisely
the founders of our American republic
built.
"I think our method of selecting :i
President l>y the vote of a college of
electors returned by direct vote of the
people a more truly democratic method
than the one followed in France, where !
the President is the choice of the As- '
sembly Nationale. It seems to me, too. |
that our system of selecting Secretar
tes of State from outside the Senate i
and Congress is preferable to the
French policy, and no time is wasted
in idle interpellations.
"In America we have a true concep- j
tion of liberty, of individual and politi- j
cal liberty. Each citizen demands his '
rights, but at the same time accords \
them to others upon the manly prin- '
ciples of 'live and let live.'
"The more rapidly our American idea
of liberty spreads through the sister !
republics, the better it will be for their
stability and welfare."

McNAUGHTON
IN THE EAST
Charges That Caused Him to
Retire From Council
Bluffs, lowa.
CAREER IS A USURER
Allegations Against New Principal
of the San Jose Normal School
Now Being Investigated.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
The more light that is thrown
upon the career of Professor
James McNaughton, recently elec
ted principal of the San Jose
Normal School, the more it be
comes apparent that there is a
cloud which, in the interest of
California public schools, requires
i to be cleared.
OMAHA, Nebr., June 24.â Nearly
ten years ac;o Professor James
McNaughton was Superinten
dent of Public Schools of Coun-
cil Bluffs, lowa, and the leading
citizens remember the professor well.
Sume of them speak well of him and
f't hers denounce him bitterly. He
certainly was a man who made
strong friends and lifelong enemies.
Senator William Groneweg, one of the
signers of the petition for McNaugh
ton's dismissal, said to-day:
"I was acquainted with Professor
McNaughton, but I do not regard my
self as his special friend, neither do I
wish to he called his enemy. During
the latter part of his residence here
he had quite a controversy with the
Board of Education, which finally
caused his resignation. It is so long
ago that I do not recall the details of
all the trouble, but at the time I
thought it decidedly to the interest and
benefit of the schools to have him step
down and out."
Ex-<'ongres?man W. 11. M. Pusey
said: "I knew McNaughton while he
had charge of our public s< hoola
some time ago. He had the reputation
nf a capable Instructor and .urged
thoroughness and a higher grade of
scholarship, which produced more or
less friction with the teachers, pupils
and their parents, and led to his dis
missal but not a betterment of the
character of our schools. His private
character and gentlemanly demeanor
while in our community were never as
sailed."
The records of the School Board show
that James McNaughton resigned Oc
tober 16, IS9O, the date of its accept
ance. Prior to that time he had been
requested to resign, and this request
was based on a petition filed with the
board and made part of the record. It
is dated September 15, 1890, and was
signed by eight leading citizens who of
fered to prove every statement con
tained in the petition. They prayed
for his immediate dismissal. The first
specification deals with McNaughton's
competency, which is seriously ques
tioned. In the second count the peti
tioners aver "that James McNaughton
is unfit for the office of superintendent
in that ho is immoral; that he is In
solent, ungentlemanly and overbearing
in his behavior t" his associates and
subordinates; that he associates with
notorious characters and induces them
to frequent the public school buildings
during Bchool hours; that h>' resorts to
tricks and practices and deceit to ac
complish his purposes."
The third specification avers neglect
of duty and the carrying on of private
business on the Bide.
The fourth specification says: "Tour
i petitioners furtlu r av< r that said James
McNaughton is ;i violator of the laws
; of the State of lowa, and has for two
years last past engaged in nefarious
ami iniquitous practices for in that he
lias been co-operating with one Ovide
Vii-n in exacting and receiving extor
tionate and usurious sums of money
from the poor and distressed for loans
made on short-time paper secured by
chattel mortgages; that he has exacted
and received scores of chattel mort
gages from the poor and weak upon all
kinds and characters of property; that
i to conceal his identity and connection
with these disreputable practices he
has had in most instancies the papers
made out in the name irf his mother-in
law, M. A. Wilson, sometimes in the
names of janitors of the public schools
and once only in his own name. The
amount he and his associates received
for the use of their money varied from
o to 11 per cent a month. This may be
illustrated by the fact that he and his
associates have received t.s high as $77
for the use of $100 for a little over nine
months, and the poor debtor has suf
fered the pangs of abjeci poverty in or
der to carry to Mr. Vien, McNaughton'a
partner, the $S a month they charged,
him for the use of the $100.
"It may be further illustrated by the
fact that theiv now remains unsatis
fied of record a chattel mortgage in the
name of his mother-in-law, M. A. Wil
son, given by a colored woman named
Ida Washington on her household fur
niture, including b.^d and bedding. All
sorts and conditions of men and women
were contracted with, and some of the
records r.nd facts connected therewith
are too disgusting and indecent to re
fer to in thesf charges, but proof can
be Riven of the same if demanded.
These charges we stand ready to
prove, nnd in the name of good gov
ernment, morality and the interests of
our public schools we demand that this
man be tried and that one so incompe
tent, so unfit and so indifferent t<> the
tender and important interests in his
charge be dirmissed."
The charges were signed by "William
Groneweg. James O'Neill, W. M. m, -
Cary, S. B. Wadsworth, George Met
calf, E. E. Aylesworth, D. B. Dailey
and G. A. Holmes.
There is no thing in the record to
show that a trial was held, and the pe
titioners were never forced to pmv~!
their serious charges. J. J. Stewart
says he investigated the case at the
time and that as a matter of fact ther^
was very little basis for the charges,
and further that if James McNaugh
ton were to run for office in Council2

M'NAUGHTON COMING
TO FACE ACCUSERS
'I.'NIX. Ariz., Juno 24.â 1 charges
made against Professor James M iNaugh
ton by the San Jose Alumni Society an
familiar to the friends of Professor Me-
Naughton In Phoenix and Tempo, ami
they are recognized as the Â«me charges
which were brought against him here to
prevent his re-election aa president of the
Tempe Normal. Originating in Council
Hluffsi these charges have followed Pro
fessor McNaughton to Grand Forks, N.
I)., and everywhere he has been engaged
in normal work. They were investigated
in North Dakota and found to be ground
less, and when Professor McXaughton
ma to Arizona ex-Territorial Superin
tendent Dalton made a similar investiga
tion, with the same result; as did also the
present Territorial Superintendent, i;. L..
Long.
'â .'lien interviewed by a Call reporter
before his departure for San jose
Fessor McNaughion said that he was
on his way to meet the accusations made
by the Alumni Society, and he was sati:;
tied that the papers lie had in his pos
session would clear him of the charges
r.iade.
it appears that there are two members
of the alumni who were formerly engaged
as teachers at the Tempe Normal, and
the trouble which has arisen was begun
by them. They tried to prevent the re
election of Professor McNaughton as
president of the Tempe Normal by using'
the- same charges, and when he was
i huson principal of the San Jose Normal
School one of these teachers stated that
.iie proposed to pn-vent the confirmation
r f Professor McNaughton by the trustees
of the San Jos< Normal.
Piofessor McNaughton emphatically de
nies the statements made by these
charges; and he sa>s he can prove that
they are false and malicious. He says
they originated in a bitter light in Coun
cil Blufts against the saloon element of
that place when he was engaged- in nor
mal work there. The board of trustees
contained three representatives of the
whisky ring, who prevented Professor
McNaughton from carrying on his work
as he desired, and as the board \V.i.S
evenly divided between the prohibition
and saloon element Professor McNaugh
ton thought it advisable to accept a po
sition as president of a North Dakota
normal school which had been offered
him. He was highly regarded in North
Dakota, and came to Arizona witli the
warmest recommendations from promi
nent North Dakota citizens.
A prominent territorial official who lived
in Council Bluffs and is familiar with tho
light which was waged against Prof>'s-
S'>r McNaughton says that there is ab
solutely no ground for the statements
made, and the best people of Council
liluffs strongly indorse the course of Pro
fessor McNaughton. In Tempe and
Phoenix there is a great deal of indigna
tion, and prominent citizens who were
. interviewed by The Call representative
said that Professor McNaughton wou'.d
have no trouble in disproving them.
Professor McNaughton left over the
Southern Pacific for San Jose as soon as
he could arrange his atfairs, and he will
meet his accusers face to face.
INVESTIGATION OF THE
ALUMNI ASSOCIATION
SAN JOSE. Juno 24.â The alumni com
mittee appointed to investigate Professor
McNaughlon's character met this morn
ing and began ite work. Attorneys John
G. Jury and Eli Wright and Frank Carl,
a teacher in Siskiyi comprise the com
mittee. With two lawyers making the
investigation it is a l larantee that it
will be searching. iTominenr. buoines.-j
men in Council Bluffs, lowa, and Ari
zona have been written to. Certified
copies of the records of â  the school . de
partment have been sent for. Evidence
of .all kinds will be gathered, and this Will
all be placed before the Trustees at their
meeting on July 19.
The student body of the Normal School
has decided to Lack up the Alumni Asso
ciation In it:- dings. This gives a much
more serious aspect to the matter. if
McNaughton is found to- be such a man
es presented and the Trustees refusa to
dismiss him there will be the greatest
School strike ever recorded. There are
â¢ bout 600 pupils In the Normal. At least
410 of these are from outside the county.
Over 90 per cent of them are girls, and
they have all declared they will not at
tend in case McNaughton is retained
should the alumni committee report ad
versely to him.
Everybody declares that even if Mi-
Naughton is retained as principal now
the school will be greatly Injured, as these
reports have been given widespread pub
lication.

TROUBLE LOOMS
AHEAD FOR If
FRENCH CABINET
hjardiy Lively to See
the End of th>e Drey
fus Affair.
Special Cable to The Call ami the Now York
Herald: Copyrighted, ISS9, by James Gor
don Bennett.
PARIS, June 24.â Trouble began*
again as soon as the Cabinet had been!
1. It is true that as a general
thintr a n>-w Ministry is accepted with- |
out too much protestation. People In
political circles look upon the members'
as forming a sori of forlorn hope.
There must be some Ministry or other
to tide over the solution of the Drey- \
fus affair. Few think that th- present
one will last more than I<> npr enough to
the liquidation of the matter at
m that it will not
yen until then.
In the meantime all the croups are
in movement, deciding what measures
â¢ ssary to Bave the republic. The
1 .'â  repul lie has so many saviors that
they â  fitting among themselves
as to which shall have the honor.
As an illustration, nothing better
' than the adventure that
happened to M. de Mahy at a meeting
of the Action Francaise a few days
iii". The Action Franeaiso is a sort
nr sublimated essence of thf LUÂ»ue
Patrie Francaise. Both associations,
of course, exist for the purpose of sav
ins the republic. Action V-insr the ral
son d'etre of the first, while t hf other
sort of gathering of Intellectual
lights, each of whom has his own i
of how to save France. In other words,
one society is the brain and the other
muscle of the Salvationists. The Action
Francaise was convoked to hear a lec
ture by its founder. M. Vaugeois, who
was to explain its objects. This leagu
meeting was presided ovor by M. dc
Mahy, a Republican of much sincer
ity, but with his own little notions as
1. 1 how the republic should be saved.
M. Vaugeois, in his excitement, for
:il about his subject and launched
out Into a violent approbation of M.
Deroulede and his recent attempt to
suborn General Roget and his troops.
At" this M. de Mahy pricked up his
ears, and finally, when he could get his
breath, he began to protest vigorously
that he had been lured into a trap, that
he was a republican, and that he would
never give his approval to such Span
ish general methods as M. Deroulede
glories in. Finally he put on his hat
and left .the platform.
The only tangible results, therefore,
of this explanation of the objects of
the Action Franeaise is to bring upon
it suspicion and to compel M. Jules la
Mai t re to send in his resignation as a
member of that body. Perhaps this
may be as good a way of saving the
republic as any other.
AWAITS THE RESULTS
OF COURT-MARTIAL!
PARIS, June 25.â Journal publishes j
the report of an interview with Marquis 1
de Gallifet, Minister of War in the new I
Cabinet, in which he is quoted as saying
that he does not intend to proceed against j
General Zurllnden, General de Bois- j
deffre, General Gonz or General Pel- j
lieux, and is convinced that none of his
colleagues in the university contemplate
rigorous measures which would resemble
persecution. For himself, his opinions,
expressed in his letter of April 15, were
unchanged, but, as a Minister, he would
share the responsibility of the act of the |
Cabinet, unless he was forced to separate
from it in the event of measures being
adopted which he considered iniquitous or i
dangerous.
In his letter to M. "Waldeck-Rousseau. I
accepting the War portfolio, he said he
would protect and defend the army, while
strictly holding it to its duties, and added:
"1 know no officer who has been more
abused than I have. 1 have never indulged i
In press polemics and think I have a !
right to Impose the same attitude upon
my subordinates. I can answer insults
with the sword. I must not bring soldiers i
Into personal quarrels and have taken i
prudential measures against officers vio- i
lating discipline; but these will not dis.
grace them. â¢
"Regarding the court-martial, I await
its findings in order to know -whether
Dreyfus is innocent or guilty. " I have
never doubted the innocence of Piequart." â¢
In concluding the interview, the War \
Minister dictated the following: "I give j
my word of honor that none of the Min
isters think of Influencing the court
martial. Whether Dreyfus be convicted '
or acquitted, the judgment of the court
will he loyally rendered and applied. '
Every one must bow to the verdict, what
ever it may be."
Eauer Loses a Juit.
The case of Queenie Montgomery and
others against J. J. Raver has been de
cided averse to the latter by the Justices
of the Supreme Court. The plaintiffs
were minors and sued Raver for moneys
that their mother as guardian had given
into the care of the 'defendant. The
mother had. given some of her own money
to Bauer. That of the children Raver
â¢knew was given in trust. Some of the
woman's money he returned and received
from her a statement that his obligation
in the premises had been fulfilled. How
ever, the jury in the lower court found
that he must pay over to the children the
Bum of HSOO, and the Judgment of the
lower court was affirmed

Cannot Conquer the Fili
pinos With His Present
Fighting Force.
SO WIRES McKINLEY
â $. â
Also Says Ground Already Taken
Must Be Abandonee Unless R:
infopoenieiits Are Hurried
ateh t i The Call.
NEW FORK, June 24.â A special to
the World from Adams, Mass., says:
A long cipher message from General
( >tis, s :n to Washinj ton and thence
red i" Adahis without the usual
â¢ 1 editing, has caused Pre .
yu Kinley many uneasy moments in
the last forty-eight hours.
All tha< i >tis told the President is
not known positively, but i.. â¢ World
correspondent is enabled to make ihis
statement :
Otis plainly Intimated his inability
to conquer the Filipinos with the pres
ent fighting strength at his command.
Furthermore, it is said he gave the Im
pression he would be forced to aban
don the ground already taken unless
reinforcements were quickly sent. It
is possible General Otis soon may be
relieved of his command.
Whether President McKinley will ask
for more troops immediately upon his
return to Washington next week or
wait until August or September has
not been fully determined.
To-day the President is inclined to
defer the inevitable appeal for rein
forcements until six 'or eight weeks
hence.
A special cable to the World from
London says: An American publicist
of high standing and unique experi
ence throughout the world, but whose
position makes it impossible for him to
disclose his name, has just arrived in
London from Manila, and has given
the World the following statement for
publication:
"I have studied the situation in th?
Philippines for eight months from the
inside. I came away with the abso
lute conviction that the Philippine
campaign, with its inevitable conse
quences, is the greatest calamity our
nation has ever encountered.
"The censorship prevents the Ameri
can people from learning the truth
about the situation. It is the most
monstrous censorship ever imposed.
The Spaniards during the war closed
down on all news dispatches without
distinction at Manila, but the present
censorship is conducted by an officer
who parades his personal prejudices
against certain newspapers, openly
favoring those whose correspondents
frame their dispatches to suit his ex
pressed wishes. So our people are sys
tematically kept in the dark and mis
led and this purposeless, criminal cam
paign proceeds."
BOUGHT SPANISH
SHIPS AND LOST THEM
NEW YORK, June 24.â A Pun cable
from Brussels says: The Petit Bleu
publishes a strange story from Manila.
It says that after the Cavite disaster
the Spanish Governor General sold at
public auction the ruins of his squad
ron. The ships were bought with their
armament by Francisco Reyes, who
went to the port of Isabella de Basilan
to take possession, but the boats dis
appeared the night previous to his ar
rival. Afterward he found them moored
in a neighboring bay.
When Reyes claimed them he found
Spanish sailors removing the guns.
When he protested they threatened to
sink the ships if he interfered. Then
the guns, numbering sixty, were drag
ged ashore and used in besieging Zam
boanga, which the Spaniards were try
ing to wrest from Aguinaldo. Reyes
has not seen the ships since and has
not obtained the return of the purchase
money.
YOUNG BUTLER AGAIN
ACCUSED OF MURDER
SPOKANE, Wash.. June 24.â Francis
H. Butler, a young Spokane man well
and favorably known here, was ar
rested to-day charged with the murder
of James Cheyne, who was fatally
\v..un<kd at Wardner the day the Bun
ker Hill mill was blown up. Butler
was arrested by a local Deputy Sheriff
on a warrant from Idaho based on an
indictment found by the Grand Jury
at Wallace.
Butler seems to be a particular mark
for prosecution by the Idaho authori
ties. He was the first man arrested
and thrown Into the Wardner "buil
pen" on the charge of complicity in the
destruction of the mill. Subsequently
he was released through the efforts of
influential friends and returned to this
city. Last week he was arrested here
on a warrant sworn out by Postolflce
Inspector B. Bratton, charging him
with conspiring to obstruct Federal
mail?. Aft or a hearing before the
United States Commissioner here he
was bound over for trial, bail being
fixed at $2r.00. Butler claims the testi
mony given against him at the hearing
was perjured.
Mrs. Sinclair of Wardner swore that
she saw Butler with the rioters carry
ing a rifle, and at the railroad station
she saw him adjust a mask over his
face. When the order was given,
"Wardner men to the front," she saw
Butler fall in with the other men from
that town.
Bail was furnished by J. D. Butler,
uncle of the prisoner, and he was re
leased, only to be rearrested to-day.
Chcyne was a non-union man, and
after the blowing up of the mill he was
shot just before the rioters left on the
train. He was brought hero for medi
cal care and died shortly after an oper
ation had been performed to locate the
bullet and reunite his severed intes
tines.
Butler is but 24 years old. He is a
graduate of a local business school and
Gonzaga College. After his release
from the "bull pen" he gave to a local
paper an Interview in which he said he
had spent the most terrible seven days
of his life and had been compelled to
endure things he characterized as be
ing unfit for a dog.
It is a peculiar fact that the perse
cution of Butler hns been remarkably
Bevere since that interview was pub
; listed.
Dennis O'Rourke was also arrested
here to-day. He is suspected of com
plicity in the riot. He is a son of Phil
O'Rourke, original discoverer of the
Bunker Hill and Sullivan mines.
GODDESS TO REIGN
OVER SAN RAFAEL
SAN RAFAEL. June 24.â With the music
of a brass band rousing the partisans to a

of a vast crowd echoing and re-echoing
throughout the town, the voting for a
â  bs of Liberty to adorn the Fourth of
July i.â  :! - closed herp this evening.

Freda Vog< !.
Little voting was done until after S
j o'clock this evening, when the fun began.
The town was actively canvassed by the
various partisans and the money began lo

as she is a very pretty girl and well fitted
to till the role required.

ROOSEVELT
WELCOMED TO
THE GREAT WEST
Continued from 'First Pa^e.
Let us not forget our comrades who this sum
mer are facing all that we faced last summer.
Let us not forget the gallant men, the regu
lars and volunteers, who are upholding the i
honor of the flag and the Interests of the na
tion in the Philippines. Surely there is not
one of us whose veins have not tingled with
pride as he read of the gallantry of those men, j
and I suppose few of us have not thought at
times that we. should like ourselves to fight i
beside Lawton as we fought beside him last I
July and to see if the Rough Riders could not
do their share of the work now done by th*
splendid men .who followed Funston. Hale and ,
other daring, leaders who, during the past six
months, have added so many pages to the ,
honor roll of American history. To our shame j
be it said that there are men in this nation ;
bo indifferent to the country's honor, so luke- |
warm In patriotism and courage that they
would let all the work of these men go tor
naughtâ let their blood be spilled in vain. But ;
the heart of our nation is sound and the puny ,
folk who deem it otherwise are woefully mis- i
taken in their countrymen. Where our flag \
lias been raised it shall not be hauled down. ;
If any difficulty seems greater than we ex
pected it merely means that we shall exert a
little more strength in overcoming it. I read
with pride the other day how both Senators
from California, those of opposite political par
ties, lined in assuring the President that
California would stand -like a rock behind him
in seeing that there was no step back in the
Philippines, and so I can assure him of the j
like spirit from the great State of which I
have the honor to be the Governor. We stand
ready to give him whatever he needs in men
at nvn> Â» 10 [>iit riown - tfae-srjroe,', twngtry .
to which we are opposed in the Philippines. He
shall have all he wishes to put it down quick
ly, and whether it is put down quickly or not. |
lie shall have our support in ever Increasing j
measure until the last spark of resistance has
been stamped out. We want no peace talk
with men who bear arms In their hands
When once they submit they .-hall be treated
with absolute justice and equity and their
rights most carefully guarded; but until they,
Fiibmit they must be taught with rough hand
what it Is to make war upon the American j
flag. There is no East and no West when we |
come to deal with questions of this kind. The j
United States is* to be the great power of the i
Pacific, and we men of the Atlantic coast are 1
good Weft*"â¢ â¢<"â Â» and are as resolutely bent I
upon upbuilding our power In the Pacific as
the men on the Pacific slope themselves.
Our nation must show itself great not only
In the ways of peace but In that preparedness
for war which best insures peace. We must
upbuild our navy and army until they corre
spond to the new needs which the new century
will bring. Above all, my comrades and my
fellow countrymen, we must build up in this
country that spirit of social and civic hon- I
â¢â¢sty and courage that alone can make this na
tion reach the highest and most lasting great
ness.
President Brodie delivered his ad
dress of welcome, and the reports of
Secretary Carter were read and placed
on file. The financial statement of the
association was also given by the sec
retary, together with a list of mem
bers and a list of ex-troopers of the
regiment who have received the bronze
badge adopted at the first meeting at
Montauk Point on August 30 last. The
reading of the minutes of that meeting
disclosed the fact that only three hon
orary members of the association were
recorded. These are Richard Harding
Davis, Edward Marshall and Lieuten
ant "Gatling" Parker. Colonel Roose
velt recalled to the minds of those
present that Captain McCormick of the
Seventh Cavalry had been made an
honorary member and the omission in
the minutes was ordered corrected.
Governor M. A. Otero, who actively
assisted a year ago in recruiting the
| Rough Riders, was made an honorary
' member of the association. The com
i mittee on constitution was ordered to
frame the by-laws so that no one but
an actual soldier at some time in his
life shall hereafter be elected an hon
orary member. Governor Otero re
sponded to the compliment in a 'neat
speech. ,'.
Governor Roosevelt was elected an
honorary president for life of the as-
I sociation. Colonel A. O. Brodie of Pres
cott was elected president and Lieuten
| ant D. O. Cerrlllos secretary for the en
suing year; Captain W. H. H. Llewel
lyn, first- vice president: Lieutenant
Goodrich, second vice president. Com
mittees â¢. on resolutions and by-laws
were appointed.
The Governor was ordered to: be
brought before the meeting, apprised of
his election and responded in an elo
quent address. There was quite a
spirited contest for the selection of the
place to hold the next annual reunion
between Oklahoma City and Colorado
Springs. The former city had decidedly
the better of it, the vote standing 89
to 12. %:.^V 'v ; ;:r;:':
Quite a number of telegrams and. let
ters of regret and congratulation were
received, including one from General
Joe Wheeler as follows:

ROOSEVELT UNABLE TO

When it was announced that Governor
Roosevelt was to visit Las Vegas, Tex..
Mayor Phelan wrote him to continue his
visit to San Francisco, offering him the
hospitality of California, and, knowing:
his love of sport, proposed a hunt in the
mountains. Tne Governor is evidently
pressed for time and says that he cannot
visit the coast on this trip. Following is
the Governor's letter:

WOMEN MAY
BE SENT TO
THE BULL PEN
Continued from First Page.
the Coeur d'Alenes for some weeks.
That the oppressions will not cease
with the arrest of the male population
is evidenced by the statement of At
torney General Sinclair to-day. He in- |
formed a woman whose husband is in i
the "bull pen" that he would no longer
submit to the criticism of women, and
that if such criticism did not immedi- j
ately cease there would be female pris
oners at Wardner as well as male. No :
one familiar with the situation here j
doubts that this infamy may be perpe- j
trated.
France permits men with whom he is j
friendly to conduct a liquor business in ;
Wardner, but the saloons of all others
are closed. From the mine owners and ,
Governor to the cheapest deputy, the I
pretext of martial law is being seized \
upon to advance the business interests i
of those In power and to ruin all up
posed to them.
Stewart, the editor of the Mullan
newspaper, who was imprisoned be
cause he published a criticism of Sin
i-i.-iii 1 , was released from the "bull pen"
to-day upon his promise to discontinue
his paper. Stewart refused to make
this promise for many days, but being
in ill health and knowing his wife and
three babies were in destitute chcum
stam i s, to save them from hunger and
himself from sickness he made the
promise and secured his release.
The effort to import miners is meet
ing with little success. Of the hundred
Mlssourians yesterday sent to Burke
less than thirty went to work, while
forty returned to Wallace. These men
are loud in their denunciations of the
deceit practiced on them in order to
induce them to leave their homes, and
declare they will walk back to Missouri
rather than take bread from the wives
and children of men who are not al
lowed to work simply because they will
not renounce allegiance to the Miners'
Union.
The court to-day overruled defend
ants' challenge to the Grand Jury sum
moned by France, the employe of the
Bunker Hill Company, and the eight
men charged with the murder of James
Cheyne pleaded not guilty.
Attorney Reddy demanded a sepa
rate trial for" each defendant, and the
prosecution elected to try Paul Cor
coran, secretary of Burke Miners'
Union, first. His trial was fixed for
July 5. No other cases were set. The
prisoners were then taken back to
Wardner to the "bull pen." The court
stated that on a proper showing by the
defense of the disqualification of France
to summon a Grand Jury it would ap
point an elisor to perform that duty,
but intimated that one of France's
deputies would be the person selected.
Attorney Reddy objected strenuously
to the appointment of any one in the
employ of France to summon a jury,
as the disqualification of the principal
would certainly extend to the deputy.
The court then postponed the matter
until Monday to allow the defense to
file affidavits showing the bias and
prejudice of deputies. The hearing of
the applications made by the Attorney
General for the removal of the County
Commissioners will begin Monday and
will require three or four days.
Oppose New Franchises.
A the last meting of the Iroqunis Club
the matter of new street railway fran
chises was taken up and discussed. Reso.
ltitions were adopted opposing the grant
ing of any franchises until the new char
ter is in effect. The Secretary was in
structed to send a copy of the resolutions
to the Board of Supervisors.

ALEXANDER MASSCN SLAIN
SHOT TO DEATH BY AUGUST
McPELTON.
I The Victim a Manufacturer of Shin
gles and the Assassin an
Employe at the
Mill.
Special I'; patch to Th
ROHNERVILLE, June 24.â Murder
was committed shortly after noon to
day at Mansion's shingle mill on Van
Duzen River, five miles from Rohner
ville. August McPeli on, who has been
employed for seven months past mak
ing bolts for Alexander Alasson, killed
his employer.
From the testimony given at the
Coroner's inquest it is learned that
McPelton had quit work and was about
to enter the employ of another shingle
manufacturer. He returned ;t ; noon!
to-day and had dinner with â :. crew.
Afterward Masson met him about two
hundred yards from the cookhouse and
asked him to pay an $.s board bill, ;;..
gave Masson $2, and said that it' M;..s
son would accompany him lo the bolt
camp he would deliver to him a saw
to liquidate the balance of the debt.
Masson agreed, but said he wanted on.;
of his m<jn to accompany them.
Just as Masson turned to call the
cot McPelton drew his revolver and
commenced firing. Five shots were
tired, four of which struck Masson, one
shattering his lower jaw, one passing
entirely through the right lung, an
other entering just below the heart and
the fourth passing through the left
forearm. Masson walked fifty yards
and then fell. He was conscious until
within five minutes c-f his death, which
occurred at 4:20 o'clock.
Masson made an ante-mortem state
ment to District Attorney Cooper. He
said he had had no words with the
murderer, save those heretofore refer
red to.
The murderer immediately ran to
Hydesville, four miles distant, and
gave himself up to Constable Godfrey.
Five deputy sheriffs were sworn in to
guard the prisoner from violence. As
soon as the news spread at the mill and
camp one of the men, armed with a
rifle, mounted a horse and endeavored
to capture the murderer, but McPelton
took a short cut through farms and
finally reached Hydesville.
The excitement here is intense and it
is feared an attempt will he made to
take the murderer from Sheriff Brown
while he is being conveyed to Eureka
to-night.
McPelton is a Russian Finn, aged
about 30. He has been employed at
various times in this country during
the past three years.
Masson was a native of Scotland,
aged 58 years. He leaves three sons
and four daughters. One of his daugh
ters is Mrs. T. Gilmore, wife of the
buyer of Goldberg, Bowen & Co., of
San Francisco. Masson was a highly
respected citizen and had lived in
Humboldt County for thirty years
past. His remains have been brought
to his home here.
.â xravcon .was the only successful
shingle manufacturer in the county
during the recent "hard times." and
made money while other mills had to
be closed. About three months ago he
purchased a tract of timber land near
here and intended to erect a shingle
and shake mill. He was always enter
prising, and his loss will be keenly felt
here. ' ___

WILL RULE CUM
FOR SOME YEARS
Uncle Sam to Govern
the Island.

AMERICANS NEED NOT HESI
TATE IN INVESTING.
English and German Investors Have
Already Commenced to Seek

tensive Operations.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
. CALL HEADQUARTERS, WELL
INGTON HOTEL, WASHINGTON,
June 24.â American rule for Cuba will
continue for some years to come, an
official with whom I discussed the
question said, and the United States
will certainly not leave the island un
til the people are able to govern
themselves. Therefore. he thinks
American capitalists need have no fear
of their Interests not being fully pro
tected.
Under the terms of the Foraker
amendment the administration is
stopped from granting any concessions
for the island of Cuba, and, if any
blame is due for the failure of Ameri
cans to obtain the best property inter
ests in tliH island, it should fall on
Congress for its enactment of this leg
islation.
Assistant Secretary Meiklejohn said
to-day that nothing: has come to the
attention of the War Department
showing activity of foreigners in mak
ing investments in Cuba. In any event,
he said, the matter was a private i :. â 
that could not be the subject of action
by this Government, as American â -vip
italists have th" opportunity of In
vesting money in the island as Eng
lishmen or others have.
It has been a matter <>f remark fur
some time that English and German
investors have been placing consider
able capital in Cuba and that Ameri
cans have hesitated to follow their ex
ample. According to an official with
whom I talked, their hesitancy is due
to the apprehension that the future
government of the island will not bo
stable and that in consequence their
property Interests will depreciate.

SAX JOSE. June 24.â A crusade has
1" on commenced in this city ac.'iinst
the abortive practice of quacks and
disreputable physicians that prom
ises to become Statewide and to bo taken
up by all tiir medical societies on the Pa-
Coast. Tills movement was started
by Rev. Father Walshe, assistant pastor
â¢if St. Joseph's Catholic Church, and now
the Santa Â«'lara Medical Society and
clergymen of all denominations have
taken up 'he cause. Father Walshe, win,
l.as been justly yclept the "little hero or"
the lii;; steepled church," is receiving con
gratulations and praise on all si.les. To
day the crusade is t!i<- most discussed
topic in tli.- < farden < 'ity.
The crusade had its Inception in a ser
mon delivered by Father Walshe about a
n i. â  r; t }i ago in St. Joseph's Church. His
subject at that time was on "Infanticide,"
taken from the text, "Thou shall not
kill."
This attracted the attention of the med

â  ng the stand taken by Father
Walshe. Strong resolutions were pass, d
at the time and the clergy of the city
were invited to be present at the n< \t

STILL CLAIMS HE SHOT
TO SAVE HIMSELF
Statement Made by Capitalist Jesse
Walters When His Death
Seems Near.
SUISUN, June 24.â After a consulta
tion to-day, Dr. W. G. Downing of Rui-
Kun and Dr. E. L. Hennessey of Napa
concluded that the wound of Jesse Wal
ters, who is held in the County
Jail here, charged with the murder of
Alfred ('ook at Napa, was in such con
dition that amputation of the leg was
necessary. The physicians concluded
to perform the amputation to-morrow.
Walters' condition being considered
critical, the attorneys for both the
defense and the prosecution were noti
fied accordingly. The conclusion ar
rived at by the physicians was prompt
ed as a possible rliance of saving the
confined man's life.
George A. Lamont and C. J. Beer-
Btecher. the defendant's attorneys, took
Walters' deposition this afternoon. The
statement made by him was that on
the day of the killing he went into the
livery stable in Napa, in which the
tragedy took place, and had no Inten
tion of meeting Cook. As soon as the
two men met, " 'ok fired upon him, the
bullet taking effect in the left leg. Wal
ters returned the fire. He admits having
killed Conk, but claims it was done in
self-defense. Walters exonerate; ex-
Sh'-riff MeKenzie. who has bÂ«en
charged with having been an acces
sory to the crime. He says McKenzie
had nothing to do with the killing.
Attorney Edward Bell, a brother of
District Attorney Theodore A. Bell of
Napa, and who is Interested with the
latter in the prosecution, was present
this afternoon. Sheriff Dunlap and the
Napa District Attorney arrived here
just after the deposition was taken,
the two having driven from St. Helena
upon receipt of the news of the criti
cal condition of Walters. The wound
ed man realizes his condition and Is
perfectly willing to have his leg am
putated. He said this evening that he
knew he could not live with the in
jured limb in its present condition and
was willing to run tho chances of re
covery after the operation was per
formed. He appears to be resting easy
this evening.

Home for the Congregation of St.
John the Baptist.
SANTA CRUZ, Juno 24,-Thp church of
St. John thp Baptist at Capltola was con
secrated to-day by Bishop Nichols, as-
Fisted by a number of clergymen. This
church, which was recently erected, is
a fine structure architecturally and is the
only church edifice in Capitola. The in
terior presented a beautiful sight this
mornins at the consecration service. The
decorations were very elaborate. Back
of the altar was an immense floral cross.
The chancel, altar rail and lectern were
massed with choicest blossoms and when
the white-robed priests were seated with
in the chancel the sight was a pretty one.
The Bervlcea commenced with the con
secration service, after which the office
of morning prayer was read. Bishop
Nichols preached an appropriate sÂ»rmnn
and then administered tne sacred rite of
confirmation to several persons. The
service closed with a celebration of the

ARCHBISHOP IRELAND
GRATUITOUSLY INSULTED
Because He Accepted an Invitation
to Address Students He Was
Attacked by Imperial
ist Papers.
NEW YORK, June 24.â A Paris cable
to the Journal says: An unprecedented
and wholly gratuitous insult has Just
been put upon Archbishop Ireland as
the result of the profoundly patriotic
discourses he has delivered since his
arrival In Paris. Many young men who
have been pursuing studies under the
direction of the Jesuits expressed a
wish that the eloquent American pre
late be invited to deliver the annual
oration at the closing exercises.
Apparently in compliance with the
wish the invitation was issued by the
director of the conference and accepted
by the Archbishop. At once the royal
ist and Imperialist papers opened fire
upon the republican churchman.
I/Autorite, the organ of Prince Victor
Napoleon, has been most scurrilous in
its attacks. It is now officially an
nounced that the invitation to the
Archbishop Is withdrawn. The aristo
cratic guests invited have been notified
that there will be no closing exercises
this year. The students, who number
over a thousand, are furious, and say
the organizers of the \ conference have
all resigned.
SOME TRUSTS BENEFICIAL.
Among Those Are the Extensive Or
ganizations of Farmers.
WASHINGTON, June 24.â A. C. True,
director of the office of experiment sta
tions, was before the industrial com
mittee to-day.
Referring to the probability of recom
mendations by the commission bearing
upon the subject of trusts, he asked
that the agricultural trusts be remem
bered. Among the farmers' organiza
tions which he considered in the na
ture.of trusts were numerous fruit asso
ciations of California and other States,
and the Milk Producers' Association of
Boston. There was also a tendency
toward organization among the cotton
growers, and if it ever took definite
shape It would be the most gigantic
trust in the country. Any law apply
ing to trusts must bear upon th-Â°se
organizations, and thero was no doubt,
he said, they had been beneficial. He
also referred to the numerous farmers'
co-operative associations, of which he
said there were 10.000 in the country.
He thought they should be subject to
State supervision for the protection of
their members against dishonesty and
lncortipetency. Mr. Holmes also sug
gested that the Southern States should
take means to limit the percentage of
liens on growing cotton crops. He con
sidered the credit system in the South
responsible for the overproduction of
this staple.
At the conclusion of Mr. TTrilrnep'
testimony the commission adjourned
until September fÂ».

Terrorizes Her Neighbors.

third street, who is credited by her neigh
bors with being a terror to them and their
children, was the complaining witness In
Judge Conlan's court yesterday against
Mrs. Margaret Pease, a neighbor, whom
she charged with disturbing her peace.
After hearing the evidence the Judge dis
missed the case and severely censured
Mrs. Cunningham for her conduct and
warned her that if she continued to an
noy her neighbors and sh.- was brought
before him she would be sent to ja.il. She
has been in the Police Courts several
times within the past few months.
Caffrey's Will Legal.
The contest to the will of Timothy Caf
frey, who died September 22, 1596, leaving
property valued at about $.10,000, insti
tuted by his niece. Julia Sliattuck, was
concluded before Judge Coffey yesterday,
and judgment was given for the propon
ents. It was alleged that the deceased
executed his will while under the in
fluence of Julia and John Caffrey and
Maurice L. Asher. and was also mentally
incapable of making a legal will. The
court, however, decided that the will was
valid and refused to set aside the order
admitting It to propate.

Special Dispatches to The Cal\.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, WEL
LINGTON HOTEL, WASHINGTON.
June 24.â A settlement of the Alaskan
boundary question by agreement to a
modus vivendi has been further de
layed. Secretary Hay received a dis
patch this morning from Embassador
Choate announcing that he had re
ceived a note from the British Foreign
Office in answer to the proposition
submitted by the Government looking
to the location of the boundary line
just above the village of the Kluckwan,
on the Dalton trail. This location was
unsatisfactory to the British Govern
ment, which desired that It should be
placed nearer the Lynn canal, but just
at what point the authorities are un
willing to say.
It is evident, however, that Canada
has shown the mother country her un
willingness to surrender her claim to
a port on the Lynn canal, and that
Great Britain is endeavoring to assist
her to secure an outlet in that water
way from her great Northwest Terri
tory.
Should she fail in this aim the au
thorities would not be surprised if a
proposition were submitted, the adop
tion of which would give Canada a
right of way for her goods across
Alaskan territory. While the authori
ties are anxious that a modus vivendi
s-hould be entered into in order that
disorder may be prevented. I was told
to-day that, this Government would
certainly not agree to any deviation
from the line it had proposed. An
agreement has been reached as to the
location of the line on White and
Chilkoot passes, and it is hoped that
the controversy regarding its location*
on Dalton trail will be quickly settled.
There is no intention, however, of
giving Canada an outlet or a right of
way for -her goods across American
soil.

WASHINGTON, June 24.-The Navy

tion of dispatching her to Samoa, it is
not probable now that she will be or

Special Dispatch to The Call.
VANCOUVER. B. C... June 24.â W. P.
Gibson, a prominent mine owner of the
Lillooet district, returned this afternoon
from Atlin. He went then? three months
ago to purchase claims for himself and
i other Vancouver people. He says:
"I never was ashamed of British law
| before, but the administration of Gov
! ernment affairs in Atlin, with the sense
less and unjust restrictions is enough
to make even a British Columbian
ashamed of his country. The country
is tied up for the season. There Is no
work for men and hundreds of people
are absolutely destitute. There is. of
course, no starvation, as men are sim
ply living off thÂ»ir fellows and leavin?
the country at the rate of 100 a day.
Last week miners' mass meetings were
held, both of Canadians and Americans.
Very strong language in denunciation
i of the officials and the Government was
; used at both, and it was once suggested
i that the whole administration, bag and
i baggage, should be shipped out by the
first steamer and an honest administra
tion set up.
"James Pringle of Victoria was in
charge at the Canadian meeting, when
! nearly 1000 miners were present. Prin
gle, Dr. Munro and one other were ap
pointed delegates to lay the disgraceful
state of affairs before the Government
at Victoria and oppose legislation
against aliens. At the American meet-
I ing strong resolutions were passed and
forwarded to Washington.
"There is no work for miners at all.
The officials are becoming rich very
fast with their interest in the townsite.
: Men have even been arrested within
j the last ten days for mining gold off
I claims that they have recorded. One
j new creek was found and li>o claims
I were staked for tho offiein's before any
j one else had a chance. Then many pe
culiar individual rases have occurred.
"Americans last year found good
claims away back on the hills and spent
j money on them and recorded them.
| Then they went back for a year, and
| now come in to Atlin City, hearing of
the alien law for the first time. A
I crowd rif heelers look out for them, and
; in dozens and dozens of instances go
i out and restake the Maims that the
j Americans have worker! on for a year.
! You don't pass a miner's tent in the
! whole district but the owner curses the
j Government and lays the blame of the
j Slien legislation on Attorney General
Joseph Martin. T cp.n tell you that a
I great many Americans are being made
i out of the Canadians this year."

REVIEW OF THE SHROPSHIRE LIGHT INFANTRY.
LONDON, June li.~ The rattling of
pwords in their scabbards grows
more pronounced, though the
War Office refuses all information
regarding the Transvaal situation
and declines to either confirm or deny
the repeated assertions of the closeting
of the British military leaders or the
dispatch of this or that -regiment to
Cape Town. The Ministers. however,
have been unable to successfully parry
the multitude of questions raised in the
House of Commons with the Intention
of getting some inkling of the Govern
ment's intention^ A reply of the Parlia
mentary Secretary of the War Office,
George Wyndham, yesterday evening,
is considered significant. Me was ques
tioned as to the truth of the report that
the British garrison in South Africa
was to be gradually increased to 40,000
men. Had the Government wished to
give a paci'leatory answer, with the
view of allaying the anxiety here and
at the Cape, the Question offered an
ample opportunity, but Mr. Wyndham
replied in two words â No, sir."
The truth is hat, whatever plans the \
Government has decided on, the Minis
ters regard it as impolitic to contra
dict reports, however extravagant, of
its warlike intentions because of the
reverberations the. reports cannot
fail to produce at Pretoria, an effect
tvhich it would be foolish to impair by
hasty denials or ratifications. At the

WINE GROWERS OPPOSE
THE CORPORATION
Santa Clara Vineyardists Seem Dis
posed to Hold Aloof From
the Organization.
SAX J< >SE. Tube ZCâ At a meeting
of wine growers this afternoon, railed
for the purpose of deciding whether or
not they would join the wine makers'
corporation, no definite action was
â  , and it looks as though Santa
Clara growers will !;â  Id aloof from the
corporation. About forty of the pr m
â¢ win.- grow ers of the county were
t. A general discussioi si I
that the wine .men are dissatisfied with
th<- management of the corporation.
The committee appointed a short time
I i b< cure contracts for the cor-
. â  lon reported and pr< sent< da'
of contract similar to those Just
pired. Only a few of the grower*
signed. This refusal to renew con
ts, it was declared, was because of
unsatisfactory workings of the corpor
ation during the past three years. A
few objected to entering into contracts
with the State organization until they
had a settlement for last year's crop.
and many went so far as to declare
that under no condition would they
join the corporation.
William Wehner proposed that the
wine makers unite and keep prices up
by distilling the surplus. This was
favorably received, as was also a prop
osition that the wine growers of Santa
Clara County should combine in the
local organization for their own pro
tection. A meeting of wine men will
undoubtedly be called to consider the
'ast proposition.

conferring with Democratic leaders
here f"r a day.
"It is ray belief," he said to-nipht

"i >v" of my reasons for coming to

we can raise $400,000 or $500,000. By

out that the company's loss will reach

Senator McMillan searching the Sec- j

of the Diamond Match Syndicate, or
so-called match trust, which endeav
ored to secure control of the entire

SUCCEED SECRETARY ALGER
NEW YORK, June 24.â A Washing
ton special to the Press says: Two
names have been suggested to succeed

eral James H. Wilson of Delaware.
General Wilson has a higti reputation
as a soldier, as a business man and as j
a military administrator. He won dis
tinction and a major general's com
mission in th-' Civil War. and he com
manded more men in the Civil War
than any oth--r officer now living. He j
has been a man of large business ex
perience, is a master of problems of
transportation and was one of the
major generals whom President Mc-
Kinley took from civil life when the j
volunteer army was put in the field;
last year.
The other name is that of General
Leonard Wood.
His Face and Hands Burned.
John Harrin. aged 12 years, living at
1172 Ellis street, was treated at the Re

CLEVELAND'S BIG
STRIKE SETTLED
Street Car Traffic Will
Be Resumed.
AN AGREEMENT REACHED
COMPANY AND EMPLOYES COME
TO AN UNDERSTANDING.
Provision Made for the Reinstate
ment of Eighty Per Cent of the
Old Hands and for Arbi
tration in Future.
Special Dispatrh to The Call.
CLEVELAND, June 24.â An agree
ment between the Big Consolidated
Street Railway Company and its strik
ing employes was reached at 6 o'clock
this evening, and it is probable that
cars will be running as usual on all the
lines of the company to-mcrrow.
Last night it wa: bellev the trou
ble was at an end. but there was a
hitch* In the negotiations this morn
ing when the company refused to sign
the proposition adopted at the meeting
of the strikers last evening. The com
pany's refusal was based on the al
legation that certain paragraphs of the
proposition which had been drawn by
the strikers' attorneys were suscepti
ble of misinterpretation and were iiot
a clear statement of conditions.
The special committee of the City
Council went to work, however, and
finally the officers of the company and
the executive committee of the strik
ers were brought together. After a
long conference the Council committ
presented a form of agreement and
asked both :ides what they thought
of it. President Everett of the street
railway company said it suited him
and he would sign it. The strikers said
it satisfied them. The document was
therefore signed hy both sides, the
strikers' committee saying no further
ratification by the strikers was nec
essary.
The agreement provides for the he.ar
ing of grievances and a resort to ar
bitration in case the men and the com
pany cannot agree, and it also pro
vides for the reinstatement of practi
cally SO per cent of the Â«.ld men at
once, the remainder, except those who
have been guilty of violence, being
placed on the waiting list. President
Everett said cars would be started in
the mornings

STOCKTON, June 24.â "The buried
treasure of Cocos Island? No; those
English men-of-war found nothingâ
not a clew to the hiding place."
"And you, captain?'!
"I have been hunting for seven years
now for the pirates' gold. "What I have
discovered in the way of landmarks is
my own secret. I have not given up the
search, and it is only a matter of time
when I shall find the treasure â $60,000,

The speaker was Captain Oeissier,
who, with a little band of followers,
sailed for the Costa Riean isle seven
years ago In the stanch little twenty
eight-foot yacht Hayseed, built by
Dave Creaner in a Stockton barn. With
his wife, who followed him to the island

BALLOTING FOR GOVERNOR
â , â
HARDIN'S WITHDRAWAL ONLY
INCREASES HIS VOTE.
â¦ â 
The Platform Adopted Arraigns the
. Republican National and State
Administrations and De
clares for Free Silver.
Special Dispatch to The Cali
: LOUISVILLE, Ky., June 24.â After a
| week of excitement the Democratic
! State Convention passed to-day in a
: tiresome deadlock. An adjournment
, was had to-night until 9 o'clock Mon
day morning without making any nom
. inations.
Business moved rapidly for a few
! hours this morning. The report of the
credentials committee, deciding favor
ably to the Stone-Goebel delegates, was
adopted, the temporary organization
was .made permanent and a platform
was adopted which reaffirms the Chi
j cago platform, declares for Bryan and
free silver in 1900, denounces trusts", ar
raigns the Republican national ami
State administrations and urges the
election of. J. C. S. Blackburn to fill the
next vacancy in the United States Sen
' ate. ... .;;": : :;'.
Then came the battle royal over nor
n inations, but before it began General
. P. Watt Hardinj, the ex-leader of the
party in this State under the silver
banner, withdrew his name as a candi
date for the nomination for Governor.
His speech, which was delivered under
; rather affecting circumstances, did
more , to strengthen his following in the
convention than* all his political work
ers have been able to accomplish since
j the delegates assembled. This was
shown 'on the first ballot, when, after
William Goebel had to his credit with
in less than a score erf enough votes to
give him the nomination, there was a
spontaneous outburst .of Hardin en
thusiasm which lasted for half an hour
and- came very nearly developing into
a stampede. As it was Hardin, who
had received only a little more than LOO
votes on the first roll call, had upward
erf 300 when, after â â¢ recapitulation, the
vote was announced. This strength he
retained during the early evening, in
creasing ii on the sixth ballot to 3.1,
or within eleven votes of Stone.
There was a decided drift in favor of
Goebel early in the voting, but it was
checked by the Stone people throwing
enough strength to Hardin to even
matters up. This was significant in
showing the inner workings of the
Stone-Goebei combination and the evi
dent purpose of the Stone men to pre
vent Goebel getting the long end of the
bargain, at least until Stone had hail
a fair teat of his strength.'
Succeeding ballots up to the elev
enth showed scarcely any change. It
is anybody's race and at present there
is no sign of a break in the deadlock.
After the second ballot the strength
of the candidates fluctuated, first one
being in the lead and then another, but
when - the convention adjourned the
highest vote. that had been recorded
after the second ballot was 394, cast
for Stone on the eighth ballot.
Earlier in the evening several at
tempts bythc Goebel forces to force an
adjournment until Monday were voted
down. After the eleventh ballot had
been taken a resolution was offered by
the GOebeL people providing that after
tb.e next ballot the name of the candi
date having the lowest' number of
votes be dropped. This was. opposed
by the combined â  strength of Hardin
and. Stone. The resolution was â¢ de
feated by a vote of 377 to 715. The
convention then adjourned until Mon
day moraine '- â¢ '' f-FIGHT AGAINST

BERLIN. June 24.â The refusal
of the Reichstag on Thursday by
an immense majority to refer the
hill to a committee is equivalent
to the death in the present form
of the ratification of the pur
chase of the Caroline, Ladrone
and Pellew islands. There was
but little excitement. Although
the Centrists polled for the pur
chase, their leaders spoke slight
ingly of the acquisition and the
public shows little enthusiasm on
the subject.
The Kladderadatsch has pub

ground are the head, feet and

MADKRA. June 24.â Notwithstanding
the competition of many points in the San i

The site, consisting of 200 acres, has been !

The Becuring of this enterprise is a sig

of the State, the university is for one year at any
â â â  impose a t.ix of $20 upon all who enter it.
fhe amount of the tax imposed may seem small to
me of the students, but to a consid
er it will be a heavy burden. The tax
will bl< â¢ doors of the university to some who
pay their share of the public charges to support it,
and therefore, however small it may be. it is unjust
and unfair. Nor can the imposition be extenuated
upon the plea that it is for one year only. Why
tudents of one year be burdened any more
heavily than those of another? Furthermore, when
a precedent for such registration fees has once been
established and submitted to, who can assure the
people that it may 1 ot be followed again and again
until at last such fees become fixed charges and the
advantages of the university be virtually confined to
the children of the wealthier class?
California is rich, and all her resources are behind
the university. There is no institution which the
people will more willingly support so long as its
education is free. Such temporary deficiencies in the
revenue as now exist can be overcome without the
imposition of an unpopular and unjust tax, and if the
Kegents earnestly try they can find a way to accom
it.

HOLDING SUBJECTS.
NOTHING is more amazing than the delusion
which is abroad that a republic can hold, rule
and own con-tented â¢'subjects. " r To the subject
! it makes no difference whether his master isa repub
lic or an empire; it is his master. If he happen to
know history he will be aware that military repub
lics, avid of conquest and holding subjects, have been
I the worst governments that ever cursed the earth ;
and blackened the name of man.
Many, people in this country seem to have sup- i
â  posed that all we had to do in the Philippines was to
i tell the people that we had bought them of Spain for
! two dollars per head and proposed to give them good
government, and to see that it was good that we pro
â¢ posed to administer it ourselves. Such a strange
mistake to be made by citizens of a republic! Who
better than we should know that no government is
good, nor can be made good, or even tolerable, ex
cept it be the free choice of the governed?
When the desire to govern himself has come to a
I man and his spirit has been touched by the glorious
inspiration of liberty, none can choose for him; his
i consent must be the only source of the just powers <
' of the government that is good enough for him.
It is well for mankind that men are still willing to
fight, willing to die, willing to be roasted in the lire, '
! for good government based on the consent of the
j governed. The world has been witness to a novel
! spectacle, and it seems to some a pity that it was pro
) vided by this republic. A commission, called a Peace
Commission, has been sent to a people who have
fought a hundred years for self-government against
1 v monarchy, to ask them to lay down their arms,
! give up their hope of self-government, their dream of
i freedom, and become the subjects of a republic!
No man has been born good enough to govern
I another without that other's consent, and the lovers
| of freedom should take courage that even in the far
islands of the sea men have learned the lesson of in- ;
dependence and aspire to it unto death.
It is this that makes our undeclared war in the
Philippines hard. The people are fighting for liberty; j
we for empire. On the Fourth of July it will be just j
five months since we began the task of compelling
the unconditional surrender of our fresh boughten j
subjects. What an anniversary to find free-born re
publicans, panting under a vertical sun, ordered to
slay a people who never offered harm to this repub
lic nor raised a finger against our mission to pro
claim liberty to all the world.
When we were fighting Spain, opposing a mon
archy, engaged in a war for humanity and to lift the
yoke of subjection from the necks of subjects, we put
only 20.000 men in the field and won in a war of only
114 days. The stars in their courses fought with us
for freedom.
In this undeclared war against our subjects in the
Philippines we have fought 140 days, and Com
mander Ford of Dewey's fleet Fays: "We hold not
quite so much ground as during the first part of
' August last year, and our lines are restricted to
i Manila." One need not be superstitious to see the
fates in this. In the first part of August last year what
ground we held in Luzon was held against Spain,
pgainst a monarchy, against a power which denies
i and defies the declaration that governments derive
their just powers from the consent of the governed.
Since then we have sent free-born soldier? to the
Philippines, until the roster reaches 37,000 men.
Twenty-seven expeditions have gone across the Pa
cific and by the Suez Canal, carrying troops and mu
nitions of war, and we have fought a poorly armed,
badly officered, untrained people 140 days, and hold
less ground against them than we did against Spain.
It is said that the administration .is pleased with
General Otis, Weyler's successor as Military < ,
! ernor of the Philippines, and it may be granted that
Otis is pleased with the administration; but whether
the people are a third party in the genial round of
pleasure over the affair is not known. This fact i>
j known, however, that fighting a people who aspire
to liberty we have been driven back from ground that
\ we held when we were fighting Spain.
We can subject the Filipinos. An army of two
hundred thousand will do it, but when we throw
them we must hold them down. Warlike and
unwilling subjects are hard to manage, to force good
; government upon them is difficult. It can be done
\ only by a standing army garrisoning every town, for
; when military vigilance is released men who want to
â be free take advantage of the jailer's absence. But
â  Great Britain says we are doing it right, and have
only to keep on killing until all the braves are dead,
and good government of the surviving cowards will
be easy.
FINLAND AND HER CAUSE.
IIIJ OR the purpose of upholding the cause of the
Finns, by education and appeals to the judg
ment of the civilized world, there has been es
tablished in London a journal to be issued from
time to time as occasion may demand, devoted to the
work of making known the conditions of Finland
and arousing popular sympathy with her people.
The first issue of the publication, a copy of which
has been just received, is a most interesting one. It
gives a brief history of the country, a review of the
constitution, an account of the coup d'etat that over
thre.v it, of the popular address of remonstrance to
the Czar, and <i record of the events which have fol
lowed the suppression of the ancient liberties of the
country, including the work of the secret agents in
Finland.
Ample allowance must be made for the color given
to the record by the sympathies and passions of the
writers, and yet even when that has been done
enough will remain to attest the great wrong done to
the Finnish people by the recent arbitrary action of
the Russian Government. It appears that in addition
to destroying the liberties of the Finns and imposing
upon them a vastly increased military burden, the
Russian agents in the country have been busy in try
ing to incite class strife among the people for the pur
pose of weakening their efforts for freedom.
The policy of inciting dissensions among a subject
people is one that has long been pursued by the as
tute despots of St. Petersburg, and has generally been
successful. Advantage is taken of whatever condi
tion of a country is most likely to give rise to dif
ference of interests in the population, and an agita
tion is started and maintained by secret agents of the
Government until popular passions run high and the
subject people can no longer act in harmony even
for the sake of liberty.
To accomplish a division among the Finns the
Russian Government, by means of newspapers and
secret agents, has started a movement in favor of an
allotment of land to all those in Finland who now
possess none. Such an agitation is cunningly devised
to excite strife between the landless and the land
owners, between the rich' and the poor, between
those who have and those who have not. The sup
pression of the liberties of Finland is thus made to
appear to the peasantry as a step toward their ma
terial improvement. It is to be noted, however, that
the Government itself has made no pledges to the
landless tb furnish them with land, and therefore can
never be charged with cheating: them when in the
THE SAX FRAKCISCO CALL, SUND^If, JUNE 25, 1899.
. r
| end they find that the whole agitation has no other
! object than that of arraying them against their em
ployers.
The scheme is interesting as an illustration of the
ways of despotism. The wisdom of the old maxim,
'"Divide and conquer." is understood in St. Peters- I
I burg as well as in Rome, and the Finnish patriots
; have a difficult task before them in combating a foe \
\ at once powerful and cunning, and unscrupulous in
â  the use of both force and fraud.
THE GAS FIGHT IN CINCINNATI.
CINCINNATI will have cheaper gas than ever
before, and probably for some time to come
cheaper gas than any other city in the Union.
It has cost her consumers of late $1 10 per thousand
feet, but is now offered her at the rate of 75 cents
per thousand feet for illuminating purposes and 50
cents per thousand feet for fuel. The same company
which has been furnishing it at the higher rate now
offers it for the lower, and there is to be no de
terioration in the quality of the gas.
The cause of the revolution in gas affairs and the
fall of gas prices is the appearance of competition in
the field. A new company has applied to the city
authorities f<~>r a franchise to operate gas works and
supply gas to consumers, and the company now oc
cupying the field and enjoying a monopoly has cut
ratc^ for the purpose of either frightening the com
petitor away or inducing the municipality to reject
its application for a franchise.
The war between the rivals has evidently been one
of the merriest struggles of the ye3r. The Cincin
nati Enquirer of June 13 comes to us with no less
than thirty-nine columns of argument on the sub
ject, and some of the argument is lively reading. It
has been charged that the new company seeks a
franchise solely for the purpose of forcing the old
company to buy it out. In response to the charge
the attorney for the new comers said in the course of
his speech: "We have been called raiders, blackmail
ers, schemers, ravishers, but I will prove to you to
day that we are not raiders, blackmailers and
schemers. I will put it to you in such a way that you
cannot get away from it. We will show that there
will be no combination, that we will neither buy nor
sell." He went on to say that his company proposes
to pay Cincinnati 2j^ per cent on its gross earnings â
that that will amount to some $400,000 in ten years,
and that "that is more than the Cincinnati Gas Light
and Coke Company has ever paid to the city or ever
will."
The vigor of that response had the effect of shifting
the argument of the old company, and they directed
their efforts thereafter to the object of proving three
things â that it is not practicable to furnish Cincin
nati with natural gas, as the new company promises
to do; that the interests of a community are best
served by consolidation and not competition in
the manufacture and delivery of gas; that invest
ments honestly made, based upon the plighted faith
of a municipality, should be protected by such muni
cipality as fully as it would protect itself from injury
nr dUrredif.
The issues involved in the controversy are for Cin
cinnati to solve, not for us. It may be that a supply
of natural gas for the city is impracticable; it may
be that such gas is dangerous and not up to the stan
dard 01 artificial gas; it may be that competition is
had; it may be that Cincinnati should protect her
dear old gas company from all fear of rivalry. One
thing, however, is beyond all doubting â the fear of
competition from natural gas has caused the present
company to offer to furnish the consumers of the city
with gas for much less than it has ever before been
furnished. The people of Cincinnati will find in that
fact much comfort and economy, and other commu
nities a lesson worth heeding.
AN ARGUS IN BLIND STAGGERS.
J~\ RGUS of old is reported to have had a hundred
/ \ eyes and to have found need for all of them
in attending to his business. The fresh Argus
of Alameda may have had an equal number of eyes
tr, start with, but of late it has been afflicted with
blind staggers and is bucking around much like a
diseased mule.
In a late issue, going it blind, the Argus declares
The Call ha> made bitter attacks on militarism in
Idaho and has asserted the negro regulars are ter
rorizing the country and subjecting white women to
insults, and then it adds: '"The colored soldiers are
rather more self-respecting and steady-going as a rule
than white soldiers. They have immense pride in
themselves as soldiers and a strong esprit de corps."
In that statement are as many errors and departures
from the path of truth as a blind, staggering beast
could make from a highway on a summer's day. The
Call has published from the districts in Idaho under
martial law reports sent out by the Hon. Patrick
Reddy and other correspondents of equal reliability.
The statements contained in these reports are not to
be refuted by exaggerating and misrepresenting them
to the verge of falsehood, and in seeking to do so
the Argus staggered into its first error.
The second stagger is even worse than the first.
The white men of the regular army will learn with
surprise that a newspaper exists in this country which
decries them as being inferior to the men of negro
regiments â inferior in self-respect, inferior in steadi
ness, inferior in pride in the service, and inferior in
the honor of a soldier.
Assertions of that kind reflecting upon the sol
dierly qualities of the men who uphold the flag of the
Union and who are now fighting in the Philippines
are insulting even when the source from which they
come is considered. There is no excuse for them.
The soldiers of the army are in no way responsible
for affairs at Wardner, and to denounce them as
worse than negroes for the purpose of making a
point in an unwarranted attack on The Call is about
as malicious a piece of folly as ever was committed.
An easy way suggests itself to help County Clerk
Deane out of the predicament in which .the threat
ened shortage of courtroom clerks places him. The
official stenographers could easily write up the min
utes of their courts and turn them over to the nine
clerks available, who could enter them in the proper
hooks without perspiring much.
The discussions of the Peace Conference of The
Hague are beginning to possess a fascinating horror.
They seem to involve little else than the considera

may be brought wholesale with the least possible suf
fering.
A Filipino brass band has been captured and some

EDITORIAL VARIATIONS.
BY JOHN McNfIUGIiT.
In the course of his address at the
opening of the recent electrical expo
sition in New York, Senator Depew
stated that to attend the first exposi
tion of the kind in that city he had
gone from his house to the hall in a
cab, two years ago he was able to ride
â  from the one place to the other in an
j electric car, but this year he had been
j carried in an automobile.
The experience of the Senator illus
; trates the rapidity with which our
! means of street travel have changed in
i recent years. While we are superior to
New York in most things, there are a
few in which they have the advantage.
Being farther east, they get the sun be
fore we do; and being more fickle in
.their habits, they adopt new means of
j travel quicker than we do. Neverthe
less we get the sun in due time and get
it in better condition than New York;
so also will we get the automobile in
season. It is coming to us and we are
coming to it. There will be a meeting
half way. The new vehicle will be the
j wagon of the hour, and everybody will
be in it except the street railway com
pany.
* * *
Since the time when it first became
clear that a self-propelling vehicle
would soon be in general use there has
been much discussion concerning the
name to give it. Few families have
had more trouble in naming the first
born than the British speaking public
has had in trying to find a name for
the new machine. Many have been the
| suggestions. Horseless carriage, elec
tropede, motorcab, autocab and a dozen
others were proposed, until at last tha
| authorities settled upon the name "au
j tomobile." Now behold the perversity
i of human nature; in New York, where
the vehicles have been in operation for
a time, the street boys have named the
big ones "Tom" and the little ones
"Tommies."
* * *
It is one of the characteristics of out
language that it is fashioned by the
! man on the street instead of by the
scholars who direct our culture, or the
authors who create our literature. It
; is for that reason our language is so
free from all the restraints that bind
other languages to the dead past; why
it has so little of formalism and stÂ»
much of vitality.
When a man of learning desires a
name for a new invention of the time
he goes to his Latin or his Greek dic
tionary and carefully culls out a word
or words which signify the nature or
the uses of the new machine, and pro
ceeds in due form to give it a high
sounding name that would have pleased
Demosthenes or Cicero. As soon as the
invention comes into general use, how
ever, the man on the street renames it
"for short." He calls the telegraph â <%.
"wire," dubs the locomotive an "en
gine," and throughout the Union will
doubtless follow the lead of the street
gamins of New York and speak of the
horseless vehicle as "Tommy."
Â-.â â  *-._.-* â¢
The charm which will incline most
cultured people to accept the newsboy
name for the automobile is its utter ir
relevancy. The chief objection is that
if the carriage be called a Tommy there
will be an almost irresistible tendency
to call the operator a "Tommyboy," and
that might lead to fights. Moreover,
as the ladies are coming to the front
in all lines of work, there may be a
numerous band of lady operators of
the new carriages; and to call them
"Tommyladies" would be hardly polite
in any circles.

One of the overlooked features of the
season has been the amount of Hurry
in certain circles over the subject of
masculine dress. It is strange that so
little attention has been given to the
subject and so little comment made
upon it, for two of the highest digni
taries in the world have taken part in
it. President McKinley has expressed
a sorrow that he cannot play golf, be*
cause it would be beneath his dignity
to wear a golf costume; and the Prime
Minister of Great Britain has declared
with something of indignation that
"the ugliest dress the English gentle
man has ever worn has lasted for fifty
years without a change."
When a President and a Prime Min
ister mourn for a lack of freedom and
beauty in dress, is it strange that lesser
men should howl? The one thing
strange is that the first sign of open
and daring revolt comes from Philadel
phia. Some club men aided and abetted
by newspaper men in that city have
boldly advocated the adoption of the
shirt waist as a part of masculine at
tire in the summertime.
The climate of San Francisco is such
that the Philadelphia movement is not
likely to affect us much in practice. It
appeals strongly, however, to the imag
ination. A Philadelphia gentleman in
a pink shirt waist is one of the crea
tures McKinley should send to London
on a mission, so that Salisbury could
see him; and then he should be painted
for the delight of future generations.
~~ *"â â â * â  'â 'â ;â  â¢.".-â 
The most lugubrious masculine wail
of the season on the subject of dress
comes from the heroes of our ever vic
torious navy, and is supported by the
Washington Post. That rather es
teemed contemporary refers to the sub
ject as a discussion concerning "the
naval officers' trousseau," and is of the
opinion it ought to occupy much more
of public attention than it does. Ac
cording to the Post, the trousseau is
too expensive for the average young
man who becomes wedded to the navy.
It says:
"Nobody has ever yet given a rational,
or at least an intelligible, explanation
of the enormous wardrobe which the
naval officer has to provide, usually out
of a very meager bank account. Just
how many different uniforms he is re
quired to provide we do not like to say;
This is not a comic newspaper, and we
object to putting the Navy Department
in the range of ridicule and laughter.
We do know, however, that the average
outfit, reduced to the smallest possible J
proportions, costs the individual any
where from $700 to $1200. And this, It
seems to us, is bringing nonsense to its i
finest point."
The point is well made and the Post
merits the thanks of the youthful naval
man for directing public attention to
the wrong done him. The President is
free to dispense with a golf costume I
if he please; no law compels the Phila
delphia man to spend his wealth fot
summer coats if he prefers a shirt
waist. Why, then, should a haughty
Secretary of the Navy require a hero
who stars in the service on a salary of '
from $1200 to $1500 a year to purchase j
about $1000 worth of fancy clothes that !
he hasn't any use for?
i Congress should call for an invest!- \
gation at once. The Secretary should
be required to appear before the House
or a committee in each of the uniforms
he imposes upon the naval heroes; and,
moreover, he should be made to pay for
them out of his own salary. There is
a way of redressing any wrong, even
that of a Cabinet officer.
Here is a story, coming all the way
from Morristown, New Jersey, which
may prove of value to the people of
Petaluma. For some time past the
newspaper offices of Morristown have
been visited regularly by a country
gentleman of the neighborhood, who
suavely but earnestly solicits all the
cast off exchanges. After his visitings
had gone on for some time a natural
curiosity arose as to what he did with
such ma?pcs of valuable information as
.W\v Jersey t-xrhanges contain, and it
was not long before the curiosity was
gratif)' '1.
The country gentleman takes the pa
pers home, soaks them in buttermilk
or sour milk and feeds them to his
hens. It is added, in the report that
comes to us. but the addition may be
mere New Jersey bragging, that the
result of such feeding is a wonderful
yield of extra large eggs, out of which
are hatched chickens as intelligent as
they are large.
It is not worth while to say of such
a story, "'it is important If true." The
main point is that considering the
source from which it comes it is :
esting whether true or false. As Peta
luma is the guardian of the chicken in
terests of California, it behooves her
press to meet the New Jersey story
promptly, and either refute it by exper
ment or tell a* better story of the effect
of newspapers on poultry.
Apropos of rural stories, the Nlles
Herald tells one of signs and symptoms
of coming events that beats anything
the East can tell on any subject. After
recording the occurrence of the recent
earthquake, the Herald says: "Mrs.
Bush of Decoto has a faculty of fore
telling earthquakes and remarked the
previous evening to the family that one
was* coming. It is said she has not
missed one or made a mistake for
twenty years or more. They are al
ways preceded with a peculiar stomach
trouble, and at no other time does she
ever feel it."
Comment on that is not only unneces
sary, but in any form could hardly be
other than impertinent, irrelevant and
immaterial. It is one of the few stories
that goes as it stands.

Since Coghlan's song of the Kaiser,
with its frequent reference to "Mein
self und Gott," has had so much vogue,
it is only fair to note the German hu
mor of the reply to it. The New York j
Sun gives what it calls a rough trans
lation of a set of verses sung at a re
cent festival of a Deutscher Krieger
bund, and intended to honor the Kaiser
and create a thirst for more beer. The I
song is too long to be quoted as a |
whole, but the first two and the last
two verses run thus:
A smart man is the Yankee man,
Still smarter is his lady;
E'en though her stocking have a hole
She always is all rea<iy.
The German wife knows how to work.
Nor e'er says "I don't care."
The Yankee lady's labor is
To work a rocking chair.
What says the Deutscher Kriegerbund
To Coghlan's foolish jabber?
Has not each man. from habit, put
His right hand to his saber?
Is not each waiting the command,
The watchword of the night,
"Forward! ye German soicikry.:"
Coghlan the devil bite!
â¦ * *
If any one like not that song he is
at liberty not to like it. A difference
of taste in matters of humor must be
allowed in every free country; and an
especial toleration must be granted to
those who dislike German humor, for
the thing is not only foreign to us, but
foreign to the Germans themselves. It
sits upon their nature In much the same
way that froth sits upon beer, being
mainly an artificial effervescence de
signed to give the substance an appear
ance of freshness; and in this particu
lar song it will be admitted the writer
and the sinsers appear to have been
very fresh indeed.

In growing old Sarah Bernhardt does
not cease to be interesting to every
thing human, and it is pleasing to learn
she is to come to us again. Age brings
to her not any sign or symptom of de

but only suffers a sea change into
something rich and strange. It is noted
that her hair, once so lustrous black as
to dim the midnight skies, has now

to new fields of theatrical adventure;

The incidents leading up to this far

are Interesting. Early in March the
Supervisors discussed a rate of $1 60 a
thousand feet. This was considered ex
orbitant and even the San Francisco
Gas and Electric Company was willing
to accept a rate of $1 50. Supervisor
Aigelunprer urged the acceptance of
this as a compromise between a rate
of $1 CO and SI 35, which had been pro
posed. The Mayor refused the compro
mise for reasons that probably recom
mended themselves to him as adequate.
He assumed, if he did not profess, the
position of a defender of the public wel
fare.

I would have the resolution drafted. He
' did bo, and Judge Seawell has done the
' rest. The Mayor's resolution was In
troduced by Supervisor Perrault and
adopted by thÂ« board. Then there went
i up a howl of indignation from the San
Francisco das and Electric Company
' t and a storm of applause for the Mayor,
I who received It modestly and urged the
j people of the city to pay no more than
I $1 10 a thousand feet for gas.
William B. Hooper accepted the ad
vice, and the San Francisco Gas and
Electric Company, with a confidence
that argues a knowledge of Inside
facts, immediately instituted suit to
fnrce Hooper to pay a rate of $1 7? a
thousand feet. Meanwhile negotiation*
between the gas corporation and the
Mayor were begun. These negotiations
placed the Mayor in another peculiar
position. He had declared with all pos
sible emphasis that a gas rate had been
established and was irrevocable for a
year, yet day after day he was in con
sultation with representatives of the
gas company for the avowed purpose
of fixing another rate.
This anomalous position did not seem
to strike the Mayor. He refused to call
a meeting of the Supervisors, he said,
until he had forced the Pan Francisco
Gas and Electric Company to terms.
From his own point of view, he had al
ready whipped the corporation and
there was nothing further to do. The
conferences continued and at last the
Mayor announced that the Pan Fran
[ Cisco Gas and Electric Company had
been brought to its knees.
It was willing to accept a rate of
$1 50, which it had voluntarily offered
three months before. The Mayor had
| scored a triumph. He established two
rate? in one year and by the adoption
of the $150 rate destroyed the $1 10
rate, and by written official contract,
adopted by vote of the Supervisors, set
tled all controversies between the city
and the company. To complete the
farce of municipal mistakes, enacted In
th<> person of his Honor the Mayor, the
resolution fixing the rate at $1 in a
thousand feet was thrown yesterday
out of court.
The important decision of Jud.ce Poa
well on the case is in full as follows:
The issue presented by the pleadings in
this case Is whether the rate which
plaintiff is entitled to charge for pas BUp
plied to defendant is $1 75 per thousand
cubic feet, or the sum of $1 10 per thou
â¢ cubic feet To show that the latter
rate is all that plaintiff Is entitled to
charge defendant's counsel has ottered In
nee resolution No. 2621 (fourth series)
of the Board of Supervisors of the city
and county of San Francisco, adopted
April 3. 1-99, by which it was. among
other things, resolved that "the minimum
lard quality and Illuminating power
of pas to be supplied by any company or
â¢ ration is hereby fixed and estab
lished at seventeen 1 17) candles, and the
maximum rate to be charged and col
! from consumers by any company or
ration is hereby fixed and estab
lished at $1 10 per thousand (1000) cubic
feet"
To this offer plaintiff's counsel have
Objected upon the following grounds, viz:
L The resolution is not uniform in its
â  operation, but singles out companies and
1 corporations as distinguished from lndi
viduals who furnish gas. and is there
i fore partial and discriminatory.
2 Thore Is no valid statute of this State
authorizing the Board of Supervisors to
fix rates to be charged for gns.
3. Tt was conceded at the hearing that
the only statute conferring upon the
Board of Supervisors power to pass the
resolution in question In The act of March
I, 1878, entitled "An act. to regulate the
quality and standard illuminating power
of gas in all cities within the State of
California having a population of one
1 hundred thousand or more." (Statutes of
1878, p. 167).
Section 1 of the act provides, among
; things, "that in all cities of the
State of California having a population
r more the local legislative body
thereof whether known or designated as
the Board of Supervisors or Board of Al
dermen or Common Council or P.oard of
Trustees, or otherwise, are hereby au
thorized' and required to fix the ,
standard quality and Illuminating
power of gas to be furnished and
rate and price for ra^h one thou
sand cubic feet to be charged therefor, by
any person, company or corporation
whose pipes or mains are or shall be laid
down in the streets or highways of such
city for the purpose of supplying gas for
the use of said city and its inhabitants."
By section 3 it is provided that the
ird and price fixed by the board may
be changed from time to time not oftener
than once every year, as increased con
sumption or other circumstances may, in
the judgment of the board, require.
Section 5 provides that after the board
shall have fixed the quality and price of
the gas it shrill be unlawful for any
person, company or corporation to
furnish to such city or any inhabitant
thereof or other person therein for illu
minating purposes gas of a lower stand
ard or quality or to charge or receive
therefor a higher price than is provided
by said board, and that for every viola
tion of the provisions of said act or the
provisions of any order, resolution or
ordinance of said board made in pur
suance thereof every such person, com
pany or corporation shall Incur a penalty
of not less than one hundred nor more
than one thousand dollars, to be recov
ered in the name and for the use of such
city in any court of competent jurisdic
tion, and that such person, company or
corporation shall also be liable to such
city and to any and each person or cor
poration who shall be injured by any such
violation In double the amount of dam
ages actually sustained.
The sixth section provides that the act
shall apply to the city and countyÂ«of San
Francisco, as well as to cities whose mu
nicipal government is distinct from the
county in which they are located.
It will be observed that while the stat
ute in express terms requires the Board
of Supervisors to lix th<_- quality and price
of gas t0 ke furnished by any person,
i )Mi any or corporation whose pip
mains are or shall be luid in the strec.d
or highways of the city, the ordinance in
question excepts from its operation ail
natural persons and Individuals.
The statute in designating the persons
who are subject to its operation Bpe<
"any person, company or corporation";
and it is claimed on the part of defendant
that it is not essential to the validity of
the ordinance thai It should be applicable
to all persons as well as to companies
THE SA!N FRANCISCO CALL., SU2TDAY, JUNE 25, 1899.
and corporations; but that the require
ments of the act are satisfied by an ordi
nance which applies to either a person,
a company or a corporation. I do not so
construe the statute. The legislative in
tent is clear that all persons as well as
companies and corporations in the cate
gory named in th* statute should be sub
ject to municipal regulation, and that the
word "or" should be read "and."
McConky vs. Superior Court. 56 Cal., S3.
Endlich on Statutory Construction, Sec.
202.
Sutherland on Statutory Construction, i
Sec. 222."
That such is the proper construction
conclusively appears by section 5 of the
act which provides that after the board
shall have fixed the standard quality and
price of gas it shall be unlawful for any
person, company or corporation to fur
nish gas of a lower standard or to charge
therefor a higher price than that fixed by
the board, .and that for each such unlaw
ful act every such person, company or
corporation shall incur a pecuniary pen
alty of not less than $100 nor more than
$1000.
The exception of "persons" from the
operation of the ordinance Is to that ex
tent a discrimination in their favor and
against companies and corporations. It
may be true that at the date of the or
dinance there were no persons other than
corporations who supplied gas to the city
or its inhabitants, but even if I am at
liberty to assume that such was the case,
I must also recognize the fact that by
section 19 of article XT of the State con
stitution any Individual has, under th?
direction of the Superintendent of Streets,
; and under such general regulations as the
muinclpallty may prescribe for damages,
the privilege of using the public streets
thereof, and of laying down pipes therein
and connections therewith, so far as may
be necessary for introducing into and sup
plying such city and its Inhabitants with
gaslight or other illuminating light. Any
existing gas company may also transfer
its plant and property to an Individual,
who would be exempt from the operation
of the ordinance. Inasmuch as the stat
ute provides, in express terms, that the
standard and price shall not be changed
oftener than once every year, the Board
of Supervisors, If the resolution in ques
tion Is valid, would have no power to
pass a new ordinance to meet any altered
conditions until April, 1890.
In determining the validity or constitu
tionality of a statute passed by the Leg
islature or of an ordinance of the Board
of Supervisors, the court has no power
to hear evidence, but must be governed
only by facts appearing upon their face
j and those of which the courts take judi
cial notice.
Conlin vs. Beard of Superivsors, 99
Cal. 17.
Bourn vs. Hart, 93 Cal. 321.
City of Eureka vs. Diaz, 32 Cal. 419.
Another well-settled rule of determining
the validity of an ordinance passed by a
municipal legislature is that the mode
prescribed by law is the measure of the
power. The Board of Supervisors has no
power to pass an ordinance or resolution
fixing the standard and price rtf gas of
any other character than such as is pre
scribed by the act of 1S78; and that act re
quires that every such ordinance or reso
| lution shall be made applicable to all per
sons, companies and corporations. The
ordinance in 'question in effect declares
that all natural persons may furnish gas
to the city and its inhabitants without
any restriction as to quality or price;
but that no company or corporation may
I furnish gas of less than seventeen candle ;
power or at a greater price than $1 10 per
thousand cubic feet.
"As it would be unlawful and unjust to
make, undf-r the same circumstances, an
act done by one person, penal, and if done
by another not so, ordinances which have
this effect cannot be sustained. Special
and unwarranted discrimination or unjust
or oppressive interference in particular
is not to be allowed. The powers
vested in municipal corporations should
so far as practicable bo exercised by or
dinances general in their nature and im
partial in their application. Municipal rp.-
Btrictions Imposed upon one class of per
sons engagi <! in a particular business
which are not imposed upon others en
gaged in the same business and under
like conditions impair the equal right
which all can claim in the enforcement of
the law." (Dillon an Municipal Corpora
tions, section 322. Â»
Our constitution provides that no spe
cial privileges or immunities shall ever
be granted and that no citizen or class of
citizens shall be granted privileges which
upon tiK- same terms shall not be granted
to all citizens. It is merely another form
of expressing the same principle, to say
that all persona in the same category
should hear equal burdens. This princi
ple is fully recognized In the act of is?s,
and it is one which should be guarded
with jealous care by all departments of
the Government. No consideration of
policy or expediency can furnish any jus
tification or excuse for departing from it.
Nor Is there the slightest necessity for
yielding to such considerations. The same
body which passed the resolution of April
:; can at any time pass another which
shall be free from any valid objection.
The language of the law is so clear, sim
ple and plain that any failure to comply
with its requirements can be easily avoid
the exercise of ordinary care and
Intelligence.
By the act of I^TS the Board of Super
visors is authorized to regulate the stand
ard quality and price of pas only as to
such persons, companies and corporations
whose pipes or mains are <>r shall be laid
d..wn In the streets or highways of the
city. The ordinance In question is not
in terms limited to such persons, com
panies or corporations, but applies to all
companies and corporations, whether they
hay.- pipes or mains in the streets or not.
I make no further comment upon this de
parture from the plain requirements of
the Btatute than to suggest to the board
the propriety, in its future resolutions, of
following the letter as well as the spirit of
the statute. â¢
11. Having reached the conclusion that
the resolution of April 3, 1599, is invalid.
for the reasons above stated, I do not
d> r-m it necessary to consider the ques
tion discussed by counsel as to the con
stitutionality of the act of 1878.
The objection to the resolution will
therefore be sustained.
J. M. SEAWELL, Judge.
Upon the filing of the decision Gavin
McNab, who represented Major Hooper,
was asked by a bystander to give his
views on the decision. "Doubtless the
decision of the court is in accordance
with the law," he said, "and I am of
the opinion that nothing further can
be done. I have requested the court,
however, to suspend entry of final
judgment in the capo until the middle
of next week. In the meantime I will
look matters over and determine the
exact status of the case, but in view of
the decision of the court, refusing to
admit the resolution in evidence, it ap
pears that the defense must fall."

Nt Pay for Jurors.
The Justice? of the Supreme <"ourt have
decided that a trial juror is not entitled
to be paid for his services as such. This
decision was handed down in the man
damus case of William Birch against
Mayor Phelan and the Board of Super
visors. IrT his petition Mr. Birch recites
that he is a citizen of fair education and
acknowledged common sense and that he
was accepted and served as a trial juror
in the Superior Court of this city. For
1 this service he demanded a fee at the rate
i of $2 per day, basing his demand upon
s ime old law on the statute books.
BirCh's bill, as presented, amounted to

ESTIMATES OF MONEY
FOR THE NEXT YEAR
Dollar Limit Demands Heroic Meas
ures of Retrenchment
Beads of Departments Request More Coin Than Was
Alowed Last Yearâ No Margin Under the Plat
form Pledges for Public Improvements.
THE pledges taken by the Mayor
and Supervisors demand that
the amount of money which
shall be raised to support the
municipal government for the
next fiscal year shall not exceed a sum
that a tax of $1 on a valuation of
$350,000,000 will produce. The framers
of the pledge certainly sought to pre
vent the raising of an excessive sum
through expansion of the assessment
â¢ oil, hence the insertion of a clause
touching the valuation.
Certain provisions of the new charter
must be considered by the Supervisors
in adjusting the estimates for the fis
cal year beginning July 1. The charter
provision requiring that the levy shall
not exceed $1 on the assessable valua
tion may be doomed inflexible, or, in
other words, a command to fix the levy
at $1. From the best information now
attainable the conclusion is drawn that
Assessor Dodge will present an assess
ment roll of $400,000,000. It is suggested,
therefore, that the Supervisors, in ap
proximating the amount of money t<>
be raised by taxes, may figure what a
tax of $1 on $:?r.0,000,000 will produce for
half the fiscal year, and also figure the
amount to be derived from an equal
tax on $400,000,000 for the last half
of the fiscal year. The new charter
takes effect January 1, 1900. so one
half of the next fiscal year will be un
der the old consolidation act, and the
other half under the new charter.
The Supervisors must do some close
figuring to keep within the bounds of
the pledge and also provide the money
necessary for proper administration of
local affairs. The last levy was
$1 31.20 on a valuation of $:-;50,000.
--000, and the various departments
did not receive as much money, respec
tively, as they are now demanding. For
example, the School Department last
yeax obtained $1,241,540. This year the
sum of $1,300,960 is demanded. Here is
an increase of $59,420. The Street De
partment last year secured $574,650. The
department now asks for $756,780. An
increase of $212,130 is here requested.
Last year Golden Gate Park received
$250,000. The amount estimated for the
next year is $352,000, or an increase of
$102,000.
In the estimate for election expenses
there is a marked decrease as com
pared with the outlay last year of $156,
--100. The amount required for the next
fiscal year, there being but one elec
tion tn pravidfi lor aside from the pri
mary, is but $50,000. Along the line in
other branches of the local government
there is a steady upward tendency. The
Sheriff asks for $177,000. The allowance
last year was $79,250, an increase of
$07,720. The City and County Hospital
last year received $95,000. This time an
allowance of $130,000 is requested. In
other branches of the Health Depart
ment increased allowances are sought.
The fire alarm telegraph, a subdivision
of the Fire Department, last year ob
tained $55,100. The estimate now in
calls for $117,450, an increase of $59,350.

WILL FIGHT TO
SAVE ESTATE
Six Children Hold a
Consultation.
Tho children of Thomas 8011, the de-
Ceased millionaire broker, whose late
home haa long been known as the "House
of Mystery." have determined to make a
battle In the courts to save sufficient for
their needs from the wreck of the dead
capitalist's, estate. Yesterday afternoon
all of the children, accompanied by coun
sel assembled in Judge Coffey's court to
diÂ«t-uss the situation .md formulate plans
Of procedure. The children. Rohina, Mu
rlel Eustace, Reginald, Marie and Fred
Beli it Is said, are hut following lines laid i
down by their mother, Mrs. Theresa Bell,
who wi"ll enter the various actions to be
instigated to preserve at least a portion
of the vast properties.
Although the children and counsel car
ried on their conversation In undertones,
and Judfce Coffey did not care to make
nubile the plans agreed upon In the se
cret conference, it was afterward an
nounced by interested persons that the
lirst move will be made by Mrs. Bell. She
i as guardian of her children proposes to
' steit down and out and in her stead either
Mlsa Marie Bell, who Is now of ape and
legally qualified to assume that position i
towar-i her your.Ker brother and sisters, j
or some other competent person will be
appointed. Then the new guardian will
: Institute an action against George
: Staacke, executor of the Will, for an ac
counting. During the trial of the action
1 for the accounting the children and Mrs.
i Bell hope to be able to find a way by
1 which a fortune may yet be dragged
from the wrecked estate. The announce
ment made by Mr. Staacke in court a ftÂ«w
days ago that in his opinion the estate
could not pay its debts has frightened
them and even Mrs Bell, whom young
Fred 'Bell says Is largely responsible for
the present condition of the estate
through her refusal to pursue the proper
course to keep it Intact, has decided that
the time has arrived lor quick and vigor
ous action.
None of the heirs, it Is said, are of tho
opinion that the executor is personally in
debted to the estate, but all are of the
opinion that he has been guilty of negli-
I gence in his handling of it. They say that
i his own business, into which he stepped
after the death of Mr. Bell, has occupied
his entire attention to the ruin of the es
tate he was charged to protect. They say
that he does not even know the location
of a third of the estate holdings, their
nature, their value nor their present con
! dition. They say that when Bell died one
piece of property, the Providence mine,
situated in Mexico, was worth a million
of dollars. For this mine Bell paid over
$500,000, they say, and in the appraisement
of the estate Us value was placed at $100.
--000. Since the death of Millionaire Bell,
and even during the last few months,
Mrs. Bell has received dividends from this
property, it is further claimed, and If it
were properly handled it would assist in
putting the estate again on a sound finan
cial basis. The New Idrla quicksilver
mine is another valuable piece of prop
erty, the control of which Is owned by the
estate, they say, but through neglect it
$76,000. This year the sum of $93,000 Is
requested, or an increase of $17,000.
In view of limitations embodied in
the new charter, the task of preparing
estimates for the next fiscal year re
quires special study. Several sources
of revenue now available will be closed
when the charter takes effect. For in
stance, the license tax on merchants,
or on certain lines of merchandise, is
abolished. This will diminish the rev
enue from the License Department. To
make good the deficiency the direct tax
on real estate and personal property
may be increased.
In round figures the cost of govern
ment in San Francisco is $6,000,000 a
yoar. It Is a staggering amount when
one considers that the taxpayer gets
neither light, water nor transportation
free. The right to breathe and walk
home unmolested is about all that the
citizen gets in return for the $6,000,000
por year.
The cost of State government is
slightly in excess of $6,000,000 per an
num, and San Francisco pays one-third
of this sum. For this outlay the citi
zens set the privilege of contemplating
the existence of the Governor and the
Legislature. The people of San Fran
cisco are therefore taxed to the tune
of $5. 000. 000 annually for local and State
government.
Taxpayers generally commend the
special efforts of the Assessor to en
large the assessment roll, yet seldom
pause to consider that the State Board
of Equalization often increases, but
never diminishes, the valuation of San
Francisco property for purposes of tax
ation. The local Assessor cannot put
the valuation too high for the State As
sessors. If Assessor Dodge expands the
Pan Francisco assessment roll from
$350,000,000 to $400,000,000, the additional
State revenue represented by the in
crease of $50,000,000 must also be paid
by our taxpayers.
A special study of local estimates Is
being made by the Merchants' Associ
ation and the expert of the Finance
Committee of the Board of Supervisors.
The Auditor is also making perfunctory
estimates and possibly shading down
some of the extravagant requisitions
from heads of departments.
The Auditor is a new man in official
life, and, being new to the business, re
gards the estimates of his office as too
sacred for inspection outside of the
Board of Supervisors. The Merchants'
Association is giving the important
subject the intelligent and systematic
investigation required.
From the data supplied by the ex
pert of the Finance Committee and
the bureau of the Merchants' Associa
tion the Supervisors will proceed to
make the allowance for the next fiscal
year. The truth will soon be made
clear that the dollar limit, which must
be observed, will not permit excessive
expenditure in any branch. It' is
doubtful if any margin will remain for
projecting new improvements or car
rying forward enterprises already pro
jected.
has become a charge upon the estate in
stead of remaining, as it was, a paying
property. Like charges are made as to
every piece of property owned by the es
tate, and in consequence a conclusion has
been reached that it is time to act if a
dollar is to be saved *.o the heirs.
That the Bell family has awakened from
Its lethargy is manifest in the fact that
the old mansion, "the house of mystery,"
is receiving a new coat of paint, the leaks
in the roof are being plugged and the
weeds of half a decade are being torn
from thoir beds. Mrs. Bell will soon ap
pear before Judge Coffey to show cause
why her family allowance should not be
stopped altogether In the near future,
and doubtless at that time she will try to
show good cause why it should not be.
Then henceforth until the- estate has re
covered its old-time vigor to a certain de
gree the courts will doubtless ring with
the charges of the heirs of Bell.
Advances made on furniture and pianos, with
or without removal. J. Noonan, 1017-1023 Mission.

A CALIFORNIA BOY
WINS DISTINCTION
Frank H. Belcher of This City Selected to Fill Basso
Roles in Grand Opera.
FRANK H. BELCHER, whose friends are legion in this city, is dea
tined to be a valuable addition to the bright galaxy of Californians
who have particularly distinguished themselves in the musical
world. Advices have just been received stating that the gifted basso
has signed a year's contract with the Carl Rosa Opera Company,
which Is recognized as the standard organization in the presentation
of classical works in England. Mr. Belcher has been singing with the troupe
during the past three months and his success was so emphatic that the man
agement secured him for next season. Ho will alternate with Arthur "vV'inck
worth, the noted English basso, and among other roles will assume that of
the King in "Lohengrin," The Landgrave in "Tarfchauser" and Mephis
topholes in "Faust."
Mr. Belcher is possessed of a fine voice of a rich, sympathetic quality. He
recently finished a three years' course in vocal culture under the ablest pro
fessors in Italy. He left this city in March, 189*5, and on reaching Milan
placed himself under the tuition of Signor G. Cima to prepare for grand
opera. Mr. Belcher mastered the basso roles in several of the leading oper
atic works and took a finishing course with Bouhey at Paris. The latent pos
sibilities of Mr. Belcher's voice, according to those who have recently ht-ard
him. have been strikingly brought out, and it is conceded that he is destined
to win enviable laurels in his chosen profession.
Mr. Belcher is a member of Stanford Parlor, N. S. G. "W. ; Olympic Club
and the Corinthian Yacht Club. He lirst became known through his appear
ance in performances given under the auspices of those popular organiza
tions, and his rendition of such songs as "Answer," "He Was a Prince,"
"I'm King O'er the Land and the Sea," "The Armorer's Song" and others
won for him unstinted praise. Some five years ago he joined Hallen and
Hart's farce conxedy aggregation and has been with several other organiza
tions, in all of which he scored successes.
Believing: that there were higher possibilities In his voice, he decided to
cultivate it with a view of appearing; in Krand opera, and his engagement
with the English company is an emphatic recognition of his talents.
Frank H. Belcher.

JOE KENNEDY THE
LAUDED IDOL OF
THE SOUTHSIDE
Victory Is Celebrated
Beyond the Slot.
KENNEDY TALKS OF THE FRAY
â¦
SAYS HE IS WILLING TO MEET
ANYBODY IN HIS CLASS.
â¦ -
The Clever Heavy-Weight Buffered
Little Injury at the Hands of
Kuhlinâ Possibility of a
Fight With Stelzner.
â¦
Joe Kennedy la now the Idol of the
south side. Mis sudden advent Into the
class of possible heavy-weight champions
was a Joyous occasion on the "Flat," for
"Blur Joe," as he Is familiarly termed,
was born and raised south of the. Blot, The
linns of Kennedy's clever victory over
Otis Ruhlin, the hard : hitting Ohtoan, who
has fought to a standstill all the top
notch heavy-weights except Sharkcy,
created widespread elation In the lower
portion of the city. The pickle factory
unfurled its flags to the breeze yester
day and at noon the class house and tho
â  .iii.i â¢ gave their whistles an extra
blast In honor of the event. Alnvuly
the loaders of the nth side's four hun
dred are planning gain social functions to
be given in honor of tholr now pugrillstl:
Idol.
When Kennedy tiros* yesterduy morning
there was a spanking team of blacks at
his door that had been furnished spe
cially by one of I. is admirers, and the
boxer enjoyed a tlrlvo to the Cliff, when?
ho \\:i> breakfasted by an aggregation i>r
sports, who jingled stacks or yellow coin
us a result of his victory.
The only Injury he suffered In his hard
twenty rounds with Ruhlln was a swollen
throat- In the first few rounds of the
battle Ruhlln sent several well directed
lefts to Kennedy's point, but the clever-
Pan Franciscan threw his head out of
range and the blows landed on his throat.
Alter receiving his portion of the re
ceipts from the Excelsior Club Joe went
Immediately home and gave It to I. is
folks.
â¢â 'l hey know how to I ike care, of it bet
ter than 1 do," he said. "] wouldn't know
what to do with all this dough." contin
; ued Kennedy In a light-spirited fashion.
"In the future l Intend to devote all cf
my lime to improving myself. During
the last few weeks l have heard consid
erable comment about my condition. They
said I w.'is lukli In flesh, and . even heard
rumors that I was not training for Hie
ti^ht. That Is certainly an injustice to
mi l will admit 1 was a trifle heavier
last night than I will be the nest time I
fight; but l was advised by my trainers.
Tim McGrath and Spider Kelly, to carry
th-> weight 1 did. I am glad" I did, for
Kuhlin is a h\K. Strong follow, and 1
needed every pound. ThÂ£ next time 1
fight i will probably weigh much l?ss
than 1 did last jiinht. My condition was
excellent, and if it had been otherwise I
could not have gone over the route. 1 ara
willing to moot anybody in my class."
Ruhlin was sorely put out over t he de
rision. "I think 1 was more entitled to the
decision than my opponent," said he yes
terday. "He landed on my face very
often, but 1 kept hammering away at his
body; nnd the referee did ... to
take any cognisance of tho terrific pun
ishment T was administering Kennedy. I
would like to sot a return match with him
either in this city or somewhere in the
East. 1 '
Kennedy has not made up his mind
whether ho will po East to take on some
of tho We fellows there. Spider Kelly
called at Harry Corbett's yesterday aft
ernoon and covered .lack >.-..-.â â¢- for
feit Of |S9P, which hÂ«;i- h*#n poÂ«tÂ«s1 thÂ«>r*Â»
for some time for a return match with
Kennedy. The Olympic Club has offered
the fighters a good purse if they agree to
meet under its auspices next month.
Fully $15,000 changed hands at Corbett'a
as :\ result of Kennedy's victory. Jack
Stelsner received the following telegram
from 'â  ' â Â»Â«. Julian yesterday:
RATH BE VCH, X. V.. June C 3. I<W>.
Jack SteUner, E3H.; 200 Turk street:
Expressed you to-day two punching
hairs; also sent set of cloves. Look out
for ml. match you to fi.cht at
Coney Island Club here any time.
Write me saying how soon you would
care to fight and whom you prefer
meeting. MARTIN JULIAN.

IN DEFENSE OF
THE PRIMARY LAW
Will Crowd McNabfor
the Honors.
A PRETTY FACTIONAL PLAY
EMINENT ATTORNEYS ARE TO
APPEAR IN THE CASE.
Buckley Will See That McNab and
Estee Are Not the Only De
fenders on the Primary
Firing Line.
i Â» attack On the primary law just
legally begun by the valiant remnant of
the almost defunct Non-Partisan organi
zation has already developed an interest
ins situation. The Non-Partisan party
now consists of George K. Fitch and
about six other estimable gentlemen. As
the new election laws give this small and
somewhat ancient coterie of pood citizens
no chance to run a full-fledged municipal
ticket of their own, they have decided to
light the existent primary lawâ the third
to be secured by the friends of good gov
ernment and one to which their full sup
port was lent until its effects on their
own organization became apparent. They
have engaged attorneys and filed a con
test.
The Election Commissioners have rallied j
to the defense of the primary law by ap
pointing Attorneys Gavin McNab and |
Morris M. Estee to save it. It is not nee- I
essary to repeat any of the many ill- j
natured remarks of the political gossips j
concerning this display of legal talent. ;
Messrs. McNab and Estee. regarding
whom the gossips nay respectively "Phe
lan" and "Burns."' will doubtless make an
able defense of the Stratton primary law
before the Supreme Court;
However, now comes Christopher A.
Buckley, proposing to Bee that the pri- j
mary law is â¢â¢def.-nded, as it ought to be |
defended." The Buckley clubs of the va
rious districts have been busy recently !
passing sets of properly â â â  pared resolu
tions concerning good government, and
one frequent clause has praised the pri- I
mary law. "Within a few days the Buck- I
ley Democratic clubs of all the districts |
will elect representatives to a general
committee, which will consider the dan
iger to the primary law and sanction by
some plan the employment of able coun- !
Hel to assist in defending the constitu- ;
tionality of this statute. The matter has
gone so far that the names of David I
Fried.- nrich of Naphtaly, Friedenrich & |
Ackennan, J. D. Sullivan, William M.
Pearson and Henry llogan have been con
sidered. Some or all of these attorneys
â will be engaged for the Buckley defense
of the primary law.
The move is beyond criticism from a
purely legal standpoint, as the saying j
'about the cooks and the. broth is not sup
posed to apply to courtrooms, but it i a |
iiyerestlng from the standpoint of fac- I
tioTVil Democratic [tics. Gavin McNab I
.is credited with bossing the Committee of
One Hundred and the element most act
ively opposed to Buckley's return to party
power. [Buckley represents the element
most bitterly opposed to Nab and his
friends. McNab gains the rst entry in j
the race to defend the primary law, and
now Chris Buckley comes along propos
ing that some other eminent attorneys
force their way into the defense. . Politi
cians and all those interested in the pri
mary law will await with interest the
McNab welcome to the Buck counsel I
and the way by -which he latter gain.-? j
a foothold in the case. Concerning the
primary law, Mr. Buckley said last night: !
"The whole press and public have been i
clamoring for years for a law that would
give citizens the right to go and voice
their sentiments at an â  . election
and the power to say who ;
should represent thorn in nor- |
inating conventions and in their govern- i
ing county committees. It is a wel l
known fact that for ten years the Demo
cratic party has had no primary election. '
except the one of ISI'2, and that was of j
such a nature that no one wanted a repe- !
tition of it. Since then there has been j
no election of any kind for delegates to I
a convention of the Democratic party.
"Now we have a primary law that is the i
best .thing ever given the citizens of this i
ctiy if they will only take advantage of
it. This law is' now attacked by the very
people who cried most loudly for such a '
law. Their reason is obviousâ does I
away with political piece clubs and wits
parties being controlled by trick and de- â 
vice. We propose, through the Demo
cratic organizations of this city, to em
ploy the very best talent to see that the
defense of the law is properly looked
after; and I have confidence that the law
will be sustained."

he had . bui it was weak, mis-

"The doctor was very much d-lighted
with the experiment, and discovered
that where he had tried Postum before

niy club the right one, but I might be mis
taken." And bo Ihe plan of creatinK one "offi
cial" club in cadi ui^trlet, in deference to the
cautious chairman, was permitted to ''go over

What the upshot will be, after consulting
"Sammy" Uraunhart and the McNab. time will
i tell. But the first meeting of the Twenty of

HARVEY ACQUITTED.
Jury Renders a Verdict in Favor of i
the Poolroom Proprietor.
SAN RAFAEL, June 24.â The jury im
paneled to try the case of Joseph Harvey,
charged with conducting a banking game
in his poolroom at Sausalito, returned a
verdict to-night acquitting the defendant. I
There were eleven jurors and two ballots
were taken. The lirst stood ten for ac
quittal and one for conviction.
The trial was replete with exciting in
ts, and at one time a collision was I
expected between Attorney D. A. Ryan,
ting District Attorney Mclsaac in j
the prosecution, and Trustee A. Sylva, for j
the defense. Ryan declared, in objecting
to the introduction of an ordinance as !
< vidence, that the Board of Town Trus
tees of Sausalito was "rotten" and by its
â  fringing the name of Marin
County into disgrace. Sylva jumped to
nd s lied in response 'that Ryan
would not dare make such a charge in'
illto.
N ." was the cool reply. "I gues3 >ou '
are safe on your own dung hill."
By Innuendo Sylva was accused of at- '
I'mpting to corrupt the Jury, and he
grew so angry at the implied charge that
se and repudiated the accusation,
saying he never tried to corrupt a jury In
such a manner.
"No, Mr. Sylva." said Mclsaac, "your
ways are dubious and past comprehen-
Eion."
The court here rapped for order and th->
trial was concluded without special inci
dent.

Great Trial stakes for two-year-olds
was the attraction at Sheepshead

ance. Mesmerist of the Bromley string
was a pronounced favorite, being sys
tematically backed from the opening of
the betting with his stable companion,
Missionary. The John Daly pair, His
Royal Highness and Krwin, and Vir

DAVID GARRICK A
HIGH-PRICED COLT
NEW YORK, June 24.â David Garrick, winner of the great Trial stakes to-day,
is a two-year-old Dy Hanover out of Teg "Woffington, and is owned by John E.
Madden. He has Deen running only this season and has participated in but few
at Morris Park, Gravesend and Sheepshead Bay, winning none, however,
and consequently attracting little attention. Ills first race was at Morris Park
on May â¢;. when, with Sims up. lie ran in the Juvenile stakes of five furlongs
for two-year-olds. The race was won by Doublet In 1:00%, David Garrick finish
ing fifth. He was also fifth in his second race at Morris Park on the 17th of the
same month. The distance was four and a half furlongs, the winner being His
Royal Highni I the time T. 4 seconds.
David Garrick tried for the Tremont stakes of six furlongs at Gravesend on the
15th lnst.. but came in at the tail end, Maribert winning in 1:15. Two days later
he finished ninth in a race of five and a half furlongs at Sheepshead Bay, which
was won by Prince of Melbourne in 1:08 2-5.
Mr. Madden paid Thomas McDowell $5000 cash for David Garrick when the
colt was a weanling. In addition McDowell would have received 53500 had the
colt won the Coney Island Futurity and 15 per cent of first money in the Stallion
stakes at Morris Park in 1599 if David Garrick had been so fortunate as to have
captured that event.
then came the Morris pair, Modrine and
Water King.
There was but little delay at the post,
the starter catching them all in motion
on the iirst break and in good order.
Virginia Earle and Mesmerist were
first to get out of the bunch, and they
ran locked to the turn into the main
track, when Mesmerist went to the
leaving the filly as if she had
Btanding still. Erwin made a bid
for honors and ran in Becond place for
a time but she soon fell back among
the half dozen of possible place horses.
Mesmerist then looked like a sure win
ner when David Garrick came from
behind him like a Hash and before the
gasping crowd had got. over the shock
he was three lengths in front and won
by that margin.

Prize.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
ST. LOUIS, June 24.â Twenty thou
sand people saw Prince McClurg, the
mighty son of Wadsworth, win the St.
Louis Derby, the premier Western turf
event, at the Fair Grounds to-day. The
attractive card offered by the Fail-
Grounds Association brought race lov
ers out in droves. St. Louis' best so
ciety was well represented. The Inner
field was thrown open to the public and
there was a great concourse of people
gathered, some afoot, others on tally
hos and vehicles of all sorts. The bet
ting ring was jammed and the betting
on all the events was spirited. The
track was not fast, last night's rain
leaving a heavy cushion.
Owing to their impressive perform
ances on the local track, Streamer was
made favorite and W. Overton second
choice In the Derby. The local talent
could see nothing but these two horses '
in the race, and great bunches of j
money -went into the ring on them.
i Prince McClurg, however, did not lack
friends. The Cincinnati contingent got
down on him to a man, as did many
others who had not forgotten his great
performances in the past. The Prince
was made third choice by the pencilers
. at 4% to 1.
To a fair start Chancery took the j
j lead, followed by Streamer and Leo
I Planter, the others strung out. At the
; quarter W. Overton assumed command.
Streamer and Be True close up, the
others bunched. At the judges' stand
W. Overton still led by a half-length,
but Billy House had displaced
: Streamer, who led Be True a head. The i
1 others were Stretched out for a dis- i
tance of six lengths. At the three
quarters Sir Gatian and Prince Me-
Clurg made a play for the fighting
leader. Frost shook up the former
sharply and he responded with a great
burst of speed, passing W. Overton as |
though he was anchored, and followed
by the Prince led _ the way into the
homestretch by three lengths, Streamer
being a half-length behind the son of
.Wadsworth.
At the last sixteenth pole Southard
brought Prince McClurg up with a
rush, and getting on, even terms with
the flying Sir Gatian a battle royal to |
I the wire ensued, the Prince winning in !
the last jump by a short head. Chan- j
eery came very strong at the finish and J
got within the money, three lengths !
ahead of Hilly House. Sir Gatian's race j
stamps him as a great race horse, and |
he had already won an event to-day
previous to the Derby.
Prince McClurg, who carried McAvoy
<Â£ Applegate's colors to victory, had al
ready proven his worth by winning the
La ton la Derby from a rich field of well
bred horses. The Prince is a son of

HOME COMING
OF VOLUNTEERS
STILL DELAYED
Senator Perkins Wires
to the President.
TEXT OF THE DISPATCH SENT
OTIS FAILS TO EXPLAIN WHY
THEY HAVE NOT SAILED.
Should the President Signify That
Volunteers Are Needed at the
Front Agitation for Their
Return Would End.
Many weeks ago messages came
from Manila announcing that the First
California Regiment would be the first
volunteer command to return home
from the Philppines. It was stated on
official telegrams that this regiment,
being the first to arrive in the Orient,
would be given the first opportunity to
return. Relying on the assurance from
the military authorities, the relatives
I and friends of the volunteers began
J preparations to give the soldiers a
! great welcome home.
When the news came that the Ore
gon volunteers were homeward bound
many supposed that the return voyage
of the California boys would not be
! long delayed. Weeks have gone by,
and yet the home-coming of the First
! California Is deferred. Last night Sen
ator George C. Perkins wired the fol
lowing message to President McKln
ley:
Previous promise from Otis not
having been fulfilled much anxiety
is now shown for the return of the
First California Regiment. Some im
mediate action is urged. Can impera
tive orders be again sent to OtisP
GEORGE C. PERKINS.
"I cannot understand," said Senator
Perkins last night, "why the First
California Regiment is not already on
its way. I have sent several dis
patches during the past few weeks on
this subject and secured a reply from
General Otis that the California boys
would leave as soon as he could start
them homeward. I have no knowledge
of what may have caused the delay."
There is no sentiment in this State
in favor of calling homo the volunteers
if their services are required ;it the
front. The men of the First California,
the first to go to the Philippines, would
be the last to request relief, if the
emergencies of the hour demanded
their presence on the firing line. Should
President McKinley or General Otis
say that the California volunteers were
needed in the field no man, woman or
child in the State would urge the Pres
ident to send the regiment home. If
the President would merely state that
the California volunteers could not be
well spared from Manila the agitation
for their return would Immediately
cease. The people of this State believe
in standing -by the country and up
holding the President, but they have
been encouraged to believe that the
First California Volunteers, having
rendered distinguished service at the
front, were listed for an early return
home. Accordingly great preparations
have been made for the home-cominÃ;
hence the feeling of suspense and dis
appointment.

YACHT COLUMBIA
STRIKES A MUDBANK
Accident Prevented a Brush Between
the New Craft and the
Defender.
BRISTOL. li. 1., June 24.â With the
rising tide and just after a heavy thun
derstorm at 6:35 o'clock to-nicht the new
cun defender Columbia, which ha? Bern
aground all day 300 yards off the Herres
hoff ducks, floated unassisted and was
towed to a' safe anchorage for the night
farther out into the stream. Last night
everybody had looked for a friendly tilt
between 'the Columbia and the Defender
to-day with the hope that to-night would
have given the world some deiinite idea
of the capabilities of the Columbia.
When the Columbia was being warped
out into the channel from the Herreshoff
docks by means of a bowline this morn
ing a heavy southerly wind swung the
stern out of the channel and the craft
brought up on what was supposed to be
a mudbank. It is not quite certain that
the Columbia's keel struck a ledge, but
the force of the blow and subsequent
damage were entirely prevented by the
mud which covered the ledge. She went
on at a receding three-quarters tide, and
after attempts to start her had failed
it was decided to wait for the next Hood
tide in the evening. She came off earlier
than was expected. The rising water
simply lifted her and the lines on her
brought the craft into the channel out of
harm's way. It is reasonably certain that
the Columbia will be towed to Newport
the first thing in the morning.

NEW CRAZE IN
ENGLISH SOCIETY
Ladies as Admirers of
Africans.
Special Cable to The <"all and the New York
Herald. Copyrighted, 1899, by James Gor-
Bennett.
LONDON, June 24.â London society, at
least the female side of it, has started a
and it is the coming of African
savages to Karl's court that has done it.
As bas been mentioned before the Karl's
bition has become a fashion
able summer promenade, and it has never
bf-en more so than this year. There Is
nothing In the whole show, notwithstand
dl ill.- fuss that waa made about the
bringing of savages to wicked England,
which was so attractive to society ladies
as those African warriors.
The stalwart chief, I'rint-e Lobengula,
has made himself quite a favorite with
ih" ladies, and "Loben," as he Is best
known, has commenced to love English
ladies in turn, as be stated In an Inter
view a representative of the Daily Mail
bad with him the other day.
Society ladies have made him rich with
trinkets and jewels, which the Prince de
lights In wearing. Jn fact ladies in su
cietj pted a number of Kaffir
words, which it has become quite the
polite circles. Thus it is
quiie common al afternoon teas and gar
den parties to hear la. lies referring to the
w< ither La "makaza," meaning cold, or
to talk oi their jewels as "Ã¼btsheng.
Now the ladies who visit Karl's Court
regularly have found a new object of in
terest in the shape <if a little bit of
chocolate-colored humanity. The new
Basuto baby, Umhlonga, as the tiny pick
aninny is called, is on all their tongues.
Burelj no baby ever had su many dis
tinguished visitors; surely no English
baby, far less a Basuto one. ever was so
petted and dandled In the arms of so
many high-born dames us this, and the
presents and expensive toys that are
Bhowered on the little biaek girl, which
Is quoted a little beauty notwithstanding
Its color, are Innumerable. It Is said tnat
there is quite an active competition going
(.n among a large number of ladies for its
godmothershlp.

Fate of San Quentin's
Incorrigibles.
Special Dispatch to The *-j....
SAN QUENTIN PRISON, June 24.â
Seven of the most desperate convicts
ever cased in a penitentiary were ro
| moved to the incorrigible cells to-day,
â  the transfer occasioning more excite
ment and leading to more dramatic in
cidents than were ever witnessed here
, before in bo short a period. Some of
j the felons were completely unnerved
; at the terrible prospect before them,
j and had to be supported by guards,
while others vented their rage and de
spair in oaths bo loud and blasphemous
â¢ that for a while the whole prison was
; in a turmoil.
The incorrigible cells, thirty-two in
j number, were completed last evening.
I They are situated on the top floor of
I the old factory building, and are built
of hard wood, studded with steel nails,
the flooring being of concrete. Each
j cell is eight feet long, four wide and
! ten high.
Jacob Oppenheimer, the assailant of
: Ouard James McDonald, was first taken
up in the elevator by Guards J. V. Rob
inson, J. D. Jones and S. L. Randolph.
He retained his surly demeanor and
! appeared unmoved at his fate. George
\ W. Schlegal and Ed Morrell came next.
K<ith were ringleaders in the conspir
i acy to murder the guards and empty
| the prison of all its inmates last March.
' Schlegal was subdued, but Morrell
j blasphemed in such a manner as to
j shock his custodians, accustomed as
j they are to the foul language of the
convicts.
The last gang taken to the "incorri
: gibles" was composed of Sir Harry
j Westwood Cooper, Al Gould and G. W.
! Bullock, all conspirators to murder and
i escape, and a Chinese named Yee Lung
1 Teong. As the crowd entered the ele
vator Bullock and Gould, who were
heavily ironed, burst into a torrent of
curses and execrated Cooper as the
', cause of their awful punishment. They
; tried to reach him, and though pre
vented by the guards, it was thought
best to send the two infuriated prison
ers up first and let Cooper and the Chi
nese follow. The titled felon turned
pale as death from fright and slunk
behind the guards.
Teong was sent to the penitentiary
j from San Francisco for seven years for
: having tried to kill one of his country
| men with a hatchet. He is an almond
eyed fiend. Six months ago he had to
be transferred from Folsom to San
Quentin, because he was always try
ing to murder prisoners who had in
curred his ill will. He was placed In
an incorrigible cell for an offense com
mitted last Monday. At that time he
followed a Chinese, with whom he had
quarreled over a packet of opium, out
of the Jute mill and struck him over
the head with a short club carried be
neath the blouse, inflicting a gash sev
eral inches long.
The completion of the , incorrigible
cells, it is prophesied, means a new era
at San Quentin, and the discipline
maintained now is the best in the his
tory of the institution. A knowledge
that the average life of a man placed
in solitary confinement is only five
j years has induced fear on the part of
j the prisoners, leading to an observance
I of even the minor rules of discipline.
The idea of building incorrigible cells
originated with Prison Director James
j, H. Wilklns, who is deserving of all the

There were in all 10,881 votes cast, costing
the voters 5 cents each. The large num

"Dutch" Riiey Arrest
ed on Suspicion.
IS KNOWN TO THE POLICE
â Â«
ACCUSED OF BREAKING OÂ£EN
THE BOXES.
At Least a Dozen Stores South of
Market Street Visited
by the Bold
Thief.
A notorious character who is known as
"Dutch" Riley was arrested last night
and locked up in the â¢â¢tanks" in the City
Prison. He is suspected of â  iking open
a number of telephone boxes tv-uth of
Market street and stealing the contents,
amounting to about 110.
Shortly after S o'clock yesterday morn
ing the superintendent of the telephone
Company was notified that .1 man who an
swers Riley's description had visited a
hay barn on Howard street near Third
and With the aid of a chisel forced open
the telephone box and got away with its
contents. The special detective who is
employed by the company was at once
sent to make an investigation and pri
marily to arrest the thief."
While he was vainly endeavoring to get
a clew to the thief several busines men
south of Market street complained to him
â¢ that the telephone boxes in their stores
had also been broken into and .1 smali
amount in nickels taken.
Realizing that a desperate thief was at
work; the officer at once re] -.:â â . to po
lice headquarters and invoked the aid of
Captain hpiliane in finding the culprit.
While hÂ«- was dilating on the necessity of
apprehending the thief at least a dozen
complaints were received from
storekeepers whose telephone boxes had
been robbed by the mysterious culprit.
.Several policemen were immediately de
tailed to tind the thief, and after a short
Investigation they became convinced that
Rilc-y was the man they wanted.
Last evening he w;Â»s found on Howard
street and taken Into custody. To-day it
:.- expected he. will be booked on several
charges of petty larceny.
Kiley is not unknown to the police. Sev
eral months ago he stood in the window
of his room on Sixth street and threw
â¢some refuse at ' ' â¢man Lynch. The
latter at once went to his room, intend
ing to arrest him. The room was in
darkness, and being unable to gain ad
mittance he promptly broke down the
door. As he entered the room Riley cid
â a companion seized him and attempted
to floor him. Lynch managed to secure -i
hold on the follow and dragged him from
ihi: room. In the struggle that followed
both ni'-n fell to the floor. Lynch cluii^
to his prisoner with the tenacity of a
bulldog; and as they rolled over the floor
ho vainly endeavored to draw his club.
After reaching the end of the hallway
â¢they rolleVi down a flight of stairs, both
ni'.n being considerably bruised in the
struggle. The curses of Riley attracted
the .â â â â â  of Policeman McCormick.
who. seeing the two -men still struggling
for supremacy; took a hand in it. Realiz
ing he could not escape Riley flnallv sur
rendered. In his room were found sev
eral packages nf washing which had been
stok-n from a laundry in the Mission.
After several continuances in the Police
Court Riley; who boasts of his "pull."
was discharged Trom tody.

PARIS, June 24.â The Herald's
European edition publishes the
following editorial under the
heading "Yellow Journalists on

Herald reprints an extract from
the New York Journal of June 13.
It is h 'sworn statement' to the
effect thai the Journal's Pads
correspondent had seen M. Char

international automobile race. It
is, however, rather humiliating
for the correspondent to have it
'given away' that the Journal
dots not accept its own staff's
reports until they have been
sworn tÂ«>' before the United
States Consul General."
NEW YORK. June 24.â A special to the

Concerning them Mr. Wood said: "Mem

TO CORNER THE CATTLE
MARKET OF THE COUNTRY
An English Syndicate With a Capital
of 5100.000.C00 Begins Opera
tions in Texas.
AUSTIN, Tex., June 24.â Hon. M. L.
Grogan, a member of the State Legis
lature from Nolan County, is here, and
is authority for the statement that an
English syndicate with a capital of
$100,000,000 has started in to purchase all
of the cattle in Texas with a view of
cornering the cattle market of this
country. He says that the syndicate is
operating in this State through George
B. Loving of Fort Worth, and in the
Panhandle and West Texas, from which
sections he has just arrived, options
have been secured on hundreds of
thousands of head of cattle. These op
tions are all for ninety days, and in
clude cattle of all classes, as well as
ranch properties in every instance when
they are attainable.
Mr. Grogan is a cattle man in the
Panhandle-, and claims to have positive
knowledge of the movement that, is be
ing made by the English syndicate to
buy up all the cattle in Texas. Mr.
Loving, the r^prrsentative of the syn
dicate, is secretary of the Texas Cattle
Raisers' Association and is thoroughly
familiar with the market and existing
conditions as to the cattle industry in
the State. Th*Â» total number of cattle
in the State is about 6.000,000 head, and
their assessed valuation is about $60,
--000. 000.
AGED MAN ACCUSED

Citizens, of Mill Valley Threaten to

upon h "L'-v.-h f-i'i.i girl, who is an orphan.
The alleged victim 'if Tyson i.^ in a pre

this city and his preliminary examination
hH'l before Justice Belltude at 10 o'clock
this morning. S<: strong \\^s the evidence
that Tyson was bound over to appear in
the Superior Court, and his bonds fixed
at S2OIH 1 . [if was sent to the County Jail
at San Rafael.
The little zirl in the case is named
Pt.-lhi Dunn. Four months ago she was
taken from the Youths' Directory in San

resided with them. When placed upon
the stand to-day she was hysterical, nut
t<>i<] a straight story.
As this Is the second occurrence of the

NEW PROTECTED
CRUISERS FOR NAVY
T\)e Derjver as Sh)e Will flppear Wher)
Completed.
The navy increase bill as passed by Congress during: the last days of its ses
sion provided for three battleships, three armored cruisers and six protected
cruisers, all of which ships are to be wood, sheathed and coppered. This lat*er
feature is a radical departure from previous practice in our navy, and has only
been brought about by the untiring efftrts of Chief Constructor Hichborn. who
for many years has advocated sheathed ships, and has at last convinced Congress
of the true economy In building vessels of this construction, which, unlike un
sheathed steel ships, will always be able to maintain their intended speed with
out the necessity of docking <<r running- uf> enormous coal bills.
The six protected cruisers of the Denver class, to be named the Denver, Dcs
Moines, Chattanooga, Galveston, Taeorna and Cleveland, are the only on's lor
which contracts can be madeâ owing to Congressional limitation of the price of
armor for the other six vesselsâ and designs for these are now being rapidly
perfected by the Bureau of Construction and Repair. They will be vesso-ls of
about the Size of the Raleigh and Cincinnati, but improved and modernized.
Th^ D< nver and her sister ships are designed for a speed of 16V2 knots, but will
only make IT knots when pushed, while the Raleigh and Cincinnati were designed
for a speed of 19 kmus.. The former .vill lie able to maintain their designe 1
speed practically indefinitely, while the latter could scarcely maintain a speed
of 15 knots, and that with an excessive consumption of coal. The horsepower
required in the now designs is 4500, as nompar<xl with ]â > t<Â»p in the Raleigh and
Cincinnati, which means less than half the weight of propelling machinery.
The general dimensions and fea'ures of the Denver and class will be as fol
lows: Extreme length, 308 feet; breadth, about 43 feet; extreme draft, fully
loaded. 16 f- â¢â¢ i 8 inches; full load displacement, about 3400 tons; bunker capa
city, not less than 700 tons. The arm.) ment will be: Main batteryâ Ten 5-inch,
50-caliber, breech-loading, rapid-firing t^urcs. Auxiliary batteryâ Eight 6-pounder*,
rapid-tiring guns: two 1-pounders, rapid-firing guns; four Colt machine guns. The
sail area will be about 9000 square feot
The coal capacity of these .ships witn bunkers full is sufficient to give them a
radius of action at full speed of about mm) miles. At the most economical rate
of steaming, probably in the neighborhood of 10 knots per hour, they will b?
able to steam about 9800 miles without recoaling. or more than sufficient to takd
them from San Francisco to Manila. The complement of each will be 27 officers,
and 25 marines.

RUMOR AGITATES
RAILROAD CIRCLES
LOS ANGELES. June 24.â Railroad cir
cles are agitated to-day over the report
that the Santa Fe had finally decided to
begin operating train service on July l
over the Southern Pacific tracks between
Mojave and Bakerstield. The story, as it
was told, was that Superintendent Burk
halter of the Southern Pacific, whose divi
sion covers the territory in question, had
been ordered home in a rush from Lake
Talioe, where he was passing a vacation,
to prepare for the proposed change. Mr.
Burkhalter is back at his work several j
weeks ahead of the date when he had in- ;
:< nded to resume active duty.
The report is partially denied, -while at :
the Santa Fe headquarters it is given out ;
that no guess could be made as to when
the San Joaquin Valley road would be
operated as part of the Santa Fe system. |
beyond the information that has from
time to time been printed. The rumor
that the Southern Pacific tracks between |
Mojave and Bakersfleld would be used on
July 1 is not regarded as possible, as no
orders on the subject have as yet been
received from Chicago and as that date is
too early. It was stated to -day that Presi
dent E. P. Ripley had delayed his intend- ;
t d visit to Los Angeles and the Pacific i
Coast until some time in September.
Two More Chances for Music Lovers.
The Lambardi Grand Italian Opera
Company has decided to give two fare
well performances at the California The
ater on Tuesday evening, when they will
repeat "Trovatbre"; and Wednesday
evening, presenting "M&non Lescaut."
There has been a great demand for these
two operas and the leading principals will
sing in them. The sale of seats com
mences to-morrow morning at popular
prices.

Tebbs' Mass to Be Repeated.
St. Dominic's Church choir, under the
direction of Rhys Thomas, will repeat the
mass music composed by C. H. Tebbs of
this city for the church and rendered so
successfully last Sunday for the first
time. The music displays originality, and
while the mass is essentially a choral one,
there are some notably fine solosâ one of
them for tenor. "Et Incarnatus Est," was
capably sung by Rhys Thomas, and a so
prano solo, "Benedictus Qui Venit," was
well rendered by Miss Atkinson. The or
gan accompaniment was rendered by Mr
Palmer.
Mr. Tebbs, composer of the music was
for many years secretary and librarian of
the Henry Leslie choir, an organization
noted In the United Kingdom for its ren
dering of unaccompanied vocal selec
tions.
Advances made on furniture and pianos, with
or without removal. J. Noonan, 1017-1023 Mission.

Goes to Navy-Yard for an
Overhauling.
The overdue British hark Almora ar
rived from Hamburg yesterday. She was
In collision off Cuxhaven, was nearly run
down by the tug that was taking hor to
sea and during a Kale the cargo shifted.
Owing to the loii^th of time she waa on
the wayâ over six monthsâ the under
writers grew uneiisy and fi per cent pre-
THE ALMORA AFTER THE COLLISION.
THE British ship Almora was in a great deal of trouble during the first part of her voyage from Ham
burg to San Francisco. While lying off Cuxhr-ven the .uxiliary schooner Maria tried to run under her
bowsprit. In consequence the Maria's mast ; and funnel were swept out of her and she drifted astern al
niost a wreck. The Almora's headgear suffered and her foretopgallant mast came down with a run.
' mium was paid to reinsure vessel and
cargo. In his report of the voyage Cap
tain Nlcolle says:
"We left Hamburg on December 0 and
reached Cuxhaveri two days later. Owing '
to stress of weather '.he ship was anchor
ed: On December 16 the auxiliary schoon
er Maria of Gothenburg ran into the Al
mora as she lay at anchor, carrying away
her bobstays, jib guys, jib stays, iron
bands on bowsprit and catheads and also
brought down the foretopgallant mast.
; The Maria then dropped astern, having
lost her two masts, one of which acted
as a funnel, and damaged her deckhouse
and starboard quarterdeck.
"The Almora was towed into the Cux
haven harbor of refuge, where the neces
, sary repairs were made. The ship was in
spected and found seaworthy, so on Janu
! ary 1 another start was made for San
Francisco. It was snowing and blowing
a strong east southeast breeze, when just
. after we passed the outer lightship one
â¢ red light was seen ahead, and a few mo
i ments later two red lights appeared. They
I developed so quickly and so close that a
collision seemed Inevitable, but in some
mysterious manner we went clear. It was
our tug, which had either cut, slipped or
carried away the hawser. We hauled the
I hawser in and put it aboard the tug when
she came alongside.
"From January 10 to 22 we had nothing
hut westerly and .southwesterly winds,
I with a very high sea, and on the latter
! date I found the ship had drifted back to
i Portland Bill. During the gales the ship
i labored very heavily and the decks were
I continually "full of water. The cargo took
a slight list to port, but it was not enough
to cause any anxiety. From the English
1 Channel to the Horn we had the usual
j weather, but between the Horn and 40
'â¢ south we encountered several heavy gales
: and violent squalls:
The United States transport Sheridan
j sailed for Manila yesterday with 1842 en
' listed men and 64 officers as follows: Two
i troops Fourth Cavalry, two companies' of
i the Fourteenth Infantry and 1270 recruits
! and casuals. The latter are organized
I into three battalions of four companies
i each, with 106 men in each company, Ma
; jor Quinton, Seventh Infantry, is in com
mand of the llrst battalion, Captain
! Dodds, Ninth Infantry, of the second and
j Major Rodman, Twentieth Infantry, of
; the third battalion.
! Colonel Daggett of the Fourteenth In
fantry is In command of all the troops
on the ship, while Lieutenant Koyden of
i the Twenty-third Infantry is adjutant,
! and Lieutenant Serratt of the Sixth Ar
! tillery is quartermaster and ordnance of
: fleer.
The soldiers on the Sheridan were very
orderly as a rule and but few of them
attempted to escape the guards and reach
the adjoining saloons. Two or three of
them got into a free fight, and one wa3
taken to the Harbor station by. Officer
Dillon. Captain Dunlevy at once ordered
him taken back to the transport, whera
he was turned over to his commanding
| officer.
The transport Valencia, with the re
maining companies of the Twenty-fourth
i Infantry, and the Pennsylvania, with thÂ«
Twenty-fifth Infantry, will sail to-mor
j row. The Wyefleld will not get away for
; a week or ten days. She and the Conne-
I maugh are to take the horses of th*
Fourth Cavalry. The Connemaugh has
! made one trip with mules already, but
stalls for the horses must be built on
the Wyefleld. .
The British bark Natuna arrived at
Port Los Angeles from Port Angeles yes
terday after a good passage of eleven
days. Captain Fretwurst was placed in
hard luck owing to the similarity of the
above two names. On leaving Antwerp
six months ago, he laid his course for
Puget Sound, ignorant of the fact that
Collis P. Huntington had changed the
name of Santa Monica to Port Los An
; geles. On June 11 the Natuna arrived at
Port Angeles, and then Captain Fret
wurst learned of his mistake. Two da ; 's
, later he got under way again and yester
; day he dropped anchor in Port Los An
i geles. He will discharge part of his cargo
there and then sail his ship to Portland
to discharge the remainder.
The cruiser Philadelphia will go to th
navy yard next Wednesday. A great
many alterations and repairs will be made
to her hull and machinery, and it will b*
jat lt as V wo months before she is se-n
I in the bay again. â¢ Electric ammunition
hoists are to be put in and new gun car
riages are required. The band left the
cruiser yesterday. Nearly 111 of "hem
were volunteers and their time was up â¢s
soon as the cruise was over.

MASONS HONOR
ST, JOHN'S DAY
AT EL CAMPO
The Past Masters' Re
union a Success.
EASTERN STAR PROMINENT
TVTA-R.RTTAT. C. H. BRYAN GIVEN A
FINE BATON.
The Outing Was One That Will
Be Pleasantly Remembered by
Those Who Were Fortunate
Enough to Attend.
St. John's day was celebrated yester
day by a grand reunion and basket picnic
at El Campo by the Past Masters' Asso
ciation of California, Free and Accepted
Masons, of which the following named are
tho officers: W. W. Moore, president; L<.
F. -Purrand, first vice president; James
A. Wilson, second vice president; L..
Schumacher, secretary, and J. Patterson,
treasurer. P. T. Barclay was chairman
of the committee of arrangements and
Charles H. Bryan marshal, a position he
has filled for fifteen years.
There were present to enjoy the hospi
tality of the association about six hun
dred persons, including an unusually
large number of ladies belonging to the
order of the Eastern Star. The picnic
was one of the most enjoyable of the sea
son, and for quietness and personnel has
never been excelled. Upon landing from
the Ukiah the picnickers marched up to
the pavilion, where President Moore de
livered an address of welcome, after
which Samuel D. Mayer sang with line
effect "The Star-spangled Banner." There
was then the lancers, after which all ad
journed to the groves to enjoy lunch.
Dancing followed in the pavilion, with
musical numbers interspersed between
dances.
Charles H. Bryan, the marshal, was
called to the plattoun. and when he asked
what the matter was he was told by P.
T. Barclay to keep quiet fur a few mo
ments', that the Past Masters' Associa
tion had for fifteen years admired the
manner in which he had conducted the
excursions, and to show their appreciation
had decided to present him a baton of
authority. He then handed Bryan a rose
wood baton embellished with the emblems
of Masonry and a silver plate bearing
the inscription:
"Presented to W.:. Charles H. Bryan
by the Past Masters' Association of Col
ifornia, F. and A. M., June 24, 1S9:1.
Worthy Master of Excelsior Lodge No
16fÂ». F. and A. M., ISTS; Marshal 1884 to
1899."
There was a response such as only the
marshal can make, after whica followed
the reading of an original poem by 11. J
Owen on "The Picnic." There were short
addresses by Major K. A. Sherman, Wil
liam S. Moses, Louis F. Durrand, Rev
W. E. Smith, the singing of 'he "Old
Oaken Bucket" by S. D. Mayer, Scotch
ballads by J. R. Oprilvle and recitations
by Miss Mabel Barclay and Miss Porter
These who did not care to dunce found
enjoyment in rambling in the Shady
groves or taking part in games.

ADVERTISEMENTS.
DANGER IN SODA.
Serious Results Sometimes Follow
Its Excessive Use.
Common soda is all right in its place
and indispensable in the kitchen and for
cooking and washing purposes, but it wa3
never Intended as a medicine, and people
who use it as such will some day re-
gret it.
We refer to the common use of soda to
relieve heartburn or sour stomach, a
habit which thousands of people practice
and one which is fraught with danger;
moreover, the soda only gives temporary
relief and in the end the stomach troubia
gets worse and worse.
The soda acts as a mechanical irritant
to the walls of the stomach and bowels
and cases are on record where it has ac-
cumulated in the intestines, causing:
death by inflammation or peritonitis.
Dr. Harlandson recommends as the
safest and surest cure for sour stomach
(acid dyspepsia) an excellent preparation
sold by druggists under the namr of
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets. These tab-
lets are large 20-gram lozenges, very
pleasant to taste and contain the natural
acids, peptones and digestive elements es-
sential to good digestion, and when taken
after meals they digest, the food per-
fectly and promptly before it has tim*
to ferment, sour and poison the blood and
nervous system.
Dr. Wuerth states that he invariably
uses * Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets in ail
cases of stomach derangements and finds
them a certain cure not only for s.Â»i.r
stomach, but by promptly digesting the
food they create flesh and strengthen tha
action of the heart and liver. They are
not a cathartic, but intended only for
stomach diseases and weakness and will
be found reliable in all stomach troubles
except cancer of the stomach. All drug-
gists sell Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets at 50
cents per package.

stomach weakness and their cure mailed

The executive committee of the Fourth

boisterous session and transa
..:â¢ bs. After throe hour

The first number on the bill was the
rt of 1 â  committee. The

The fireworks committee was given a
chance to present its report. The b
thai ensued waa fought out on n
each committeeman having
bd< ' lal suggestion to make. Fifteen hun- .
tired dollars was originally allowed for

two displays â one in the Mission,
ai th<- Chutes. Lust evening a
. the North End appeared
before the committee and asked for a!
pyrotechnic display in that section. This
wan the bone of contention. The matter
was 'malty settled by a compromise,
which results in a display at the Cl
I Glen Park and the third in V.
Square. The <_'!:t>-s and Glen
Park display will cosi $700 each, and that,
of Washington Park $200, or as much more
as is collected from the North End of!

REV. DR. LOCKE MAY
LEAVE HIS CHURCH
The members of the Central M. E.
Church will learn with surprise that their
pastor. Rev. Dr. C. E. Locke, may short
ly leave his pastorate here for "fields
anew."
It was rumored recently that h*> hnd re
ceived a call fmm a larpo congregation In
the Eastern State* and that the matter
had been referred to the proper authori
ties of the church.
When asked about the rumor yesterday
Pr. Locke expressed great reluctance to
he Interviewed, stating that such ques
tions were by the ru!.-s of his church not
usually availaM* for publication until
their settlement. Learning that thÂ» fact
of the Eastern offer had substantially
leaked out Mr. Locke finally consented to
make the following statemf-nt:
"Yes It Is true that I am considering
an Invitation to an Eastern church, sub
ject to the approval and appointment of
the muhoritles. ThÂ» matter has br-fn
submitted to the Bishops for thHr de
clslon but as yet I have not received
official Information. T would have much
preferred that no publicity had h*en
given to this Invitation until a decision
had been announced. If T shall bÂ» assign
ed to another field, though. I shall leave
Central Church and San Francisco with
profound regret, yet I shall regard it as
B call of duty nnd entf-r upon my new
work with brightest anticipations."
From another source it was learned thar
Buffalo Is the city which has extended
the call to Dr. Locke.

NATIONAL GUARD
OF CALIFORNIA
THE NUMBER OF COMPANIES IN
THE SERVICE NOW.
Orders That Are Misleadingâ lnspe
tions and Results â Naval Militia
Cruise.
An examination of the roster of thp
companies of the National Guard of this
State shows that at this time the armed
force of the State is made up of the fol
lowing:
First Brigade â Brigade com
mander and staff, signal corps, Troop
C, Troop D, Seventh Regiment of In
fantry, field and sta'. officers and
"band, and all the companies of the
regiment except Companies E and H,
which have it reported under the
provisions of the bill passed at the
last held session of the Legislature.
Second Brigade â Brigade com
mander and staff, signal corps. Troop
A. Fifth Regiment of Infantry, field
and staff officers and band, and all the
companies of that regiment.
Third Brigade â Brigade com
mander ar.d staff, signal corps. Troop
B. Second Regiment of Infantry,
field and staff officers and band,
and all the companies except A,
F, H and I. not reported. Sixth
Infantry Regiment, field and staff of
ficers and band, and all the companies
of the regiment.
Through pome oversight of the office boy
in the Second Brigade or some one else.
Company D of San Rafael, Second Bri
gade, was not included in the companies
that 'Were to be. mustered and inspected
last week. The omission was discovered
when there was a counting of noses and
; the mistake was rectified by sending
Major Jansen. the brigade inspector,
to inspect the property of and the com
pany itself last Friday afternoon and
evening.
On account of ,1 mistake of that office
hoy or some one else In the Second Bri
gade the orders as to elections were de
cidedly mixed. Special order 11 calls for
the election of a captain in Company F,
as a successor to Captain I/. E. TVenll.
but this should have been C. L. K. Wenk,
and the same order has created confusion
from the fact that it announces that thÂ«
members of the company shall assemble
at the armory on Thursday, June 28, to
elect a captain. The calendar declares
that the 2Sth of June falls on a Wednes
day and not on a Thursday. The mem
bers of the company are in doubt as to
whether the order means that they should
assemble on Wednesday, the 28th. or
-Thursday, the 2f>th. In special order 10,
in which there Is a call for another elec
tion, the date and the day of the week
are as badly mixed as in order 11. A
number of the men who recently went
through a rigid military course and
learned that they are required to obey
only such orders as can be carried out
are of the opinion that they are not in a
position to know when to assemble, as
they cannot meet on a day and date that
do "not coincide with the calendar.
The recent Inspections in the Fifth In
fantry show that the majority of the
members who enlisted in the volunteer
service but were not pent to the front
have returned to the several companies
from which they enlisted. Their carriage
and deportment at muster and inspection
showed what a few months in the field
can do for men In the way of Improving
their military appearance. As a rule, the
companies of this regiment made a most
creditable showing, and considering that
each company had but three days' notice
for inspection the attendance was excel
1. lit. the numerical shortage not exceeding
seven in any company. The details of the
several inspections have not yet been re
ceived.
"Troop C, Third Brigade, was inspected
last Friday night by Lieutenant Colonel
Huber. Last night he inspected the
Fourth Division of the Naval Militia at
Santa Cruz. Next Tuesday night Lieu
tenant Colonel Louis Barrere. I. R. p.,
will inspect the officers and First Divi

eral Government during the recent war
upon the i enlistment of the member* of
the guard, are now being replaced The
new adjutant general proposed at an
early day to equip the guard as it should
be. This is a step that ought to have
been taken a long time ago, as the com
panies with a very few exceptions. areTn

uniforms and equipments are concerned

WAITING FOR
THE BUILDING OF
A NEW SCHOOL
Melrose Pupils at a
Disadvantage.
MANY GIVEN DIPLOMAS
SUFFERING BECAUSE OF THE
FUSE WORKS EXPLOSION.
â â¦ â
The Class Graduates From Private '
Houses and Presents a Testi
monial to Its Prin
cipal.
i
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, June 24.
The graduating exercises at the Melrose
Grammar School forcibly brought to mind
the explosion of the fuse works a year
ago, which wrecked the school building.
It is necessary to hold the graduating ex
ercises in private houses, as the town of
Melrose is at present without a school
house. It was so badly damaged by the
explosions that renovation is an impos
| sibility. It has been decided to build a
new school, but the residents have not
yet fixed upon a site for the new building.
The exercises were -ield at the residence
of the principal, Professor David Wil
liams, where the diplomas were distrib
uted by County Supenntendent Crawford.
After the graduating exercises the young
I folks adjourned to the home of one of
i tbeir pupils, Miss Lulu Roane, to hold
| their jinks.
There are one hundred pupils in the
i school, patiently laboring under great
', disadvantages, and anxiously looking for
i some improvement frum present condi
: tions. Notwithstanding this drawback,
Principal Williams has successfully grad-
I uated all of the pupils of his highest
! grades, although the examinations this
1 year were considered particularly difficult.
The programme of ihe exercises was;
Instrumental music. Miss Addle Mar
shall: salutatory. Master Jos.-ph
Daram; instrumental music, Miss Ad
die Marshall; recitation, "On the Rap
pahannoek," Miss Myrtle Scriven; mi
i strumcntal music, Miss Grace John
son; recitation, "Revolutionary Kis
ing " Miss llannan Taft; recitation,
â¢'Kentucky Belle," Miss Lulu Roane;
piano solo. Miss AdJie Marshall; reci
tation, â¢'Soldier's Reprieve," Miss 101
--sie Roane; instrumental music. Pro
fessor J. C. Haramti; recitation, "Ihe
General's Cloak." Miss Edith Lai â¢
After the presentation of diplomas the
graduating class presented a testimonial
in the form of a set of engrossed resom
' tions to Principal Williams. The resoiu
< tions were as follows:
Whereas, We. the members of tr>e
fraduating class, of Melrose Grammar
chool. In order to express the great
appreciation and love we bear for iur
teacher, Mr. Williams, take this
method of expressing our gratitude
for the care and untiring energy he
has always shown in our behalf.
Therefore, be it
Resolved. Firstâ That as he labored
so earnestly in order that we might bo
successful "in obtaining what we o
much desired we owe him our sincere
thanks, best wishes and lasting re
membrance, now that we are about to
leave him. L ...
Secondâ That we tender him this in
token of our esteem, with the signa
ture of each member of the clasp at
tached, to assure him that we will al

MAIL-CARRIERS TO CUT LOOSE
The annual picnic of the Letter Car
riers' lUutual Aid Association promise?
to be one of the great events of the sea
son, and it if being looked to with plea
surable anticipations not only by the
members of the association themselves,
but by the hundreds of people who ex
pect to spend a happy day with the em
ployes of Uncle Sam at Schuetzen Park
next Sunday.
The programme leaves nothinp to be de
sired. There are parties enough to take
in everybody who thinks he can run,
jump, shoot or do anything else in the
sporting lineâ an excellent programme
for those who don't care for anything
and know that they cannot do anything.
The prizes for the various events are at
tractive enough to draw in professions,
but as professionals are barred, the day
promises to Vie a good one for amateurs
who think they can outclass anybody
else.
Aside from all this, the object of the
i picnic is a most worthy one. The asso
, elation was organized ahout ten years apo
j for the payment of sick and death bene
i fits. The income from regular sources is
' necessarily small and the profits of the
day will go to replenish a treasury which
has become somewhat depleted.
The committee of arrangements consists
! of H. M. Locke. W. W. O'Neil, Thomas
i Nixon. George W. Spiller. W. J. Phelan.
R. D. Barton. James E. Haedrlch. Joseph
H. Hqgan, John F. O'Connor. Joseph Mc-
Gill. R. B. Beall, James C. Murphy, H.

A Famous Light Battery From Fort

Assignment of Of
cers.
Private William E. Hawthorne Battery
O. Third Artillery, is a deserter. Yester
day morning: shortly after 8 o'clock ho !
. made his escape and up to a l;n hour
- last night the military authorities had no
â 'clew as to his whereabouts. Soldiers
[have mada their escape from the Pre
sidio before, but for daring Hawthorne's
liight has never been equaled. Closely I
guarded by a mounted trooper in a part |
â¢\)f the post where the alarm could bo I
most easily given and where his chances
to get away ere comparatively Email, \
the artilleryman took his life in hjs own,
.â¢);ands. succeeding in eluding his guard <
and in making good his escape from the :
: -reservation. Hawthorne was confined In
.the guardhouse a few days ago upon .1
'.charge of larceny and was waiting his i
trial by court-martial, He is a member
oÂ£ the new battery now being recruited, | .
and attempted, so it is char Red, to pick
the pocket ot' a fellow .-tidier.
Yesterday morning Hawthorne, vith â 
reveral other prisoners, under the conduct \
of Trooper Austin of Troop li, were de- j
tailed on fatigue duty. The men were '
upon what is known as cart duty. That j
I is, they have to visit the officers' quartern ,
and remove the garbage from the cans
that are always kept In the rear of the
houses.- The party under Trooper Austin ,
had visited the post hospital and re
moved the refuse from that place. They
nuxt went to Surgeon Ware's quarters I
which are next to the hospital. The cart j
was halted at the rear tale and Haw- j
thorne and two of the other men went ;
into the yard. In a short while two of I
the men came out, saying that there was j
nothing to be removed, and then it was ;
tthat the guard heard the gate thai sep
arates the front and back yards slam
quickly together. In an instant he took
in the* situation and realized that Haw
thorne had attempted to escape by the
way of the front gate of the quarters,
which opens upon the drive that sepa
rates the eastr-rn row of officers' quarters
: : m the maze.
Austin sprang from his horse at the
Fame time unslinging his carbine. He ran j
through the yard, and just as he reached
the front gate he saw Hawthorne dash j
down the embankment into the ixslzq. \
Austin had no time to take aim, but |
Mazed away at the < reaping soldier, He
missed him and the bullet cut the leaves
from the trees just as Hawthorne dived
into the thick undergrowth and disap- ;
peared from sight. Austin had to return !
and take charge <>f the â¢ her prisoners. As
soon as he was able to do so he reported
Hawthorne's escape at the guardhouse. A ! (
search was made for the fugitive, but he j
had succeeded In getting off the reserva
tion. The officers of the post hope to ef
fect the capture of the soldier before he j |
can leave the city.

Presto! What a Change.
Feels Like Kicking Doctors for
Three Years' Suffering.
' The Itching and burning I suffered in my feet
and limbs for three years were terrible. At night
they were worse, and would keep me awake a
greater part of the night. I consulted doctor after
doctor, as I was travelling on tho road most of
my time, also ono of our city doctors. None of
the doctors knew what the trouble was. I got
a lot of the different samples of tho medicines
I had been using. I found them of so many
different kinds, that I concluded I would have
to go to a Cincinnati hospital before I would get
relief.. I had frequently been urged to try Cu-
ticura Remedies, but I had no faith in them.
.My wife finally prevailed upon me to try them.
Presto! What "a change. I am now cured, and
it is a permanent euro. I feel like kicking some
doctor or myeelf for suffering three years when
I could have used Cuticura remedies.

on Butter street and was a brilliant af
fair in every sense. The banquet hall
had been elaborately decorated with a
profusion of American flags and other
emblem* and the tables were arranged
in the form of a square.
The Knights and their ladies to the
number of one hundred participated and
the gathering was prcsiile<l over by Com
mander of the Drill Corps Colonel Wil
liam Edwards. In a few well chosen re
marks he ordered the assembled company
to forthwith engage in the pleasant oc
cupation of discussing an excel li ;it menu
and at judicious intervals ealied upon
several gentlemen to respond to toasts.
"Grand Commandery" was responded to
by grand commander of California. Emi
nent Sir John Francis Merrill: "Golden
Gate Commandery," Generalissimo Sir
Robert McMillan- "Our Flag," Eminent
Judge Sir John R. Aitken; "The Poet,"
Sir Courtland S. Benedict; "The Ladies"
Sir Charles L. Field.
During the repast the guests were en
tertained with delightful music by a
stringed orchestra and after full justice
had been done to the good things pro
vided by a competent caterer adjourn
ment was taken to the large hall where
an informal dance was enjoyed.

had charge of the entertainment con

STATE NORMALS
THREATENED BY
A REVOLUTION
Course May Be Cut to
Two Years.
ELEVATION OF THE STANDARD
ATTENDANCE WOULD BE MUCH
DECREASED.
Plans, Problems and Needs of the
New San Francisco School May
Produce Profound
Changes.
A possible revolution in the State nor
mal schools is impeding as one result of
the recent appointments by the Governor
of new boards of trustees for these in
stitutions located at Chico, San Jose, Los
Angeles and San Diego, and now also at
San Francisco. A big: shaking up of this
pedagogical system, and much contro
versy is apt to result soon.
It is proposed to raise the standard of
the schools and make them purely nor
mal schools by raising greatly the stand
ard of admission and reducing the term
of instruction from four years to two. A
much-lessened attendance and a large re
duction of the cost of these Institutions
to the State would be one of the results.
For years boys and girls have been ad
mitted to the State normal schools on
qualifications acquired at graduation from
a grammar school course. The first two
years of the normal course has been sim
ilar to that of an ordinary high school,
and during the last two years high school
instruction has gone hand in hand with
that in the science and art of teaching. A
large proportion of the students have at
tended these normal schools simply as a
means of general education without the
intention of entering the teaching pro
fession, though many of these have been
attracted by the :idvantage that a nor
mal school diploma is a good thing for a
young man or woman to fall back on if
needed in the future.
The threatened revolution seems to have
proceeded from the new San Francisco
trustees, though Stato Superintendent of
i'uhlic Instruction Kirk is reported to ha
heartily supporting It. It is also said by
the Sail Francisco trustees that the new |
Los Angeles and San Diego boards ap
prove the plan of making these institu
tions normal schools for the training of
capable teachers and l.othing else, leaving
general education to the abundant high i
schools and higher institutions of learn- ,
Ing.
The San Francisco board is com- '
posed of President S. C. Denson,
Secretary H. G. W. Dinkelspiel.
M. Cooney, P. A. Hyde, and W. Job
son, with the Governor and State Superin
tendent as ex-offlcio members. When this
board approached the problem of creating
the new San Francisco institution for
which the Legislature appropriated $20,00u ;
for the two years, it was realized that to
establish another high school in this city 1
would be ;i waste of money, and it was
argued by M. Cooney and others that the
State should not be called upon to support
a high school, anyway.
It was at once proposed to require grad
uation from a high school or its equiva- ,
lent as a standard 0* admission, to makp
the term two years and to devote this !
time to a review of studies from a teach-
Ing standpoint, to pedagogical instruction
and to practical work in the San Fran
cisco public schools. It -was proposed to
add to the borrowed equipment of the
<'ity Normal School, to supplement the
w..rk of an able staff with courses of
pedagogical lectures by university pro
fessors and to turn out teachers of rather
superior scholarship well grounded in
professional wisdom.
.But section 1492 of the Political Cn<v a;<
amended last winter was found to block
this plan. It provides for a joint board
of Normal School Trustees, to be com
posed of the chairman and two other
members of each board, which shall meet
yearly at alternate schools and which
shall prescribe a uniform course of wxt
books, a uniform standard of admission
and graduation from all the schools. It
thus became apparently necessary to open
in San Francisco what would be a rather
b< ad ciass and needless high school,
with a four years" course, to which pu
pils could go from the grammar schools,
because the rest of the normal schools
were run on that standard.
The result of the dilemma was that the
idea of making all the State normal '
schools purely normal schools with a ;
two-years' course and a higher standard
was agitated. As stated. Superintendent 'â¢
Kirk and some of the trustees of other
scii. mis are understood to favor the plan.
A meeting of the joint board will be held
in Los Angeles July 12 and the matter
will be then thoroughly canvassed.
It has been proposed that if this cannot
be dime because of opposition, the "uni
formity" required by law might be pre
served and the San Francisco school still
left free by simply dividing the four
year course into a "preparatory" and a
regular one and neglecting to establish
a "preparatory" course in the San Fraai- 1
cisco school.
This cutting down of the term and rais
ing of the standard would necessarily drive
many pupils at existing normal schools
to the high schools. San .lose has a tine
high school, but the normal school at
tendance is over 600. The change would
greatly Increase the attendance at the
San Jose High School. -Chico, it is un
derstood, has no high school, the normal
answering the purpose well. I,os Ange
les and San Diego arc in the position of
San Jose.
Tho San FranHsco trustees will meet
Monday evening to elect the teaching
staff of the now school.

BECSEY'S FACE
SLAPPED IN
OPEN COURT
Fight Between Bailiff
and Attorney.
JUDGE TREADWELL REFEREE
HE GIVES HIS DECISION AGAINST
THE ATTORNEY.
During the Excitement a Woman
Faints in the Court and Is Car
ried Out on a Stretcher
to the Hospital.
An exciting scene occurred in Juflcre
Treadwell'a court yesterday morning, |
which seriously disturbed the proceedings
and caused more than a ripple of excite- j
' ment for a few moments.
Catherine Murphy had been convicted :
by the Judge of using vulgar language,
and Attorney Becsey, who is an ex-sol
dier and has on more than one occasion
proved himself to be a fighter, went into
the inclosure fronting: the dock. Bailiff \
Gallagher ordered him out, and he re- |
fused to go, as he said he wanted to j
speak to his client. Gallagher took hold
of Becsey's coat and forced him outside '
the inclosure. Catherine, seeing her at
torney in danger, uttered a piercing :
scream and fell to the floor in a faint.
Gallagher continued to force Becsey :
along to put him out. of the courtroom, j
but Becsey grabbed hold of the railing
and veiled "Let me alone; I am an officer
Of the court." Gallagher had hold of his
coat with his left hand, and with his :
right slapped Becsey twice on the face
while Becser*B right swung round Gal- I
lagher's hands. Just as Gallagher drew
Back his hand to "soak" Becsey on the
jaw the Judge shouted. "What's the mat
ter there?" and rapped with his gavel for
"I am an officer of the court." panted
Becsey "and this man is trying to force
me out of the courtroom. Let go my
coat!" he yelled, as he made another un- |
successful "swing for Gallagher's head.
â¢]l<Â» forced his way into the Inclosure," |
said Gallagher, "and when I checked him ;
he got fresh."
"Let him alone." commanded the Judge, ;
and Gallagher reluctantly released his j
hold.
"You have no right within that inclos- â¢
ure," said the Judge, sternly, to Becsey,
"and the bailiff was quite right in putting :
you out. Sit down, sir, and behave your- â¢
self."
Just then Posecuting Attorney Carpen- I
ter"s voice was heard above the din as he
Said: "Your Honor, the case of Thomas ]
L. Young has been called." The Judge '
paid r.o attention, and Becsey yelled, "I I
am an officer of the court and ask for |
protection."
"Sit down. I say," said the Juclp<\ an
grily, "or I will take other measure?.
This had the depirert effert. and Becsey
walked out of the court, declaring: as a
soldier and a Rentleman that he had been
grossly insulted.
Meantime the patrol wagon had ncen j
summoned and Catherine Murphy was ;
removed to the Receiving Hospital, where |
she soon recovered from her fainting â 
spell and was taken to the City Prison.

HELEN WILDER TELLS HOW SHE IS FULFILLING 1
HER STRANGE AND LONG CHERISHED IDEA
b OF WHAT CONSTITUTES A ROMANTIC HONEY
*, MOON AND THE PROPER WAY TO SPEND' IT.
IX a vine covered cottage at
Nlles. Helen K. Wilder-Craft, the
Honolulu heiress, is spending her
solitary honeymoon.
The desire to do "something dif
ferent," to leave the beaten track, led
to the extravagant folly of a lonely
bridal tour. \
Helen Wilder thought that a honey
moon minus the generally consid^ red
necessary groom would be no end of a
lark, and just "darn good fun."
Helen Wilder-Craft is inclined to dis
agree with the wildly merry conclu
sions of her prehyphenated self, and
from a matron's standpoint to take ex
ception to a maiden's idea of what con
stitutes a "good time."
At the self-same moment that the fair
day of May 16 was born, the island
heiress stood ; the side of H. J. Craft,
and repeating the solemn words after
the Rev. Nua. promised to love and
honor the man who vowed to cherish
and protect her. Ten hours later Mrs.
Craft, with the secret of her new wife
hood securely locked in her breast,
stood aboard a steamship bound for
this city, gayly shaking "a-day-day" to
the man whose name she bore and who
was disappointing her so keenly by do
ing as she bade him do.
Mrs. Craft has not in so many words
dclared that Helen Wilder's plan of
honeymoon is flat and stale and un
profitable. She still contends that all
Pmust admit it is romantic. But the
romance of it lends no color to h>-r
cheek, no glow to her eye, no buoy
ancy to her tones.
"Wouldn't you 11kÂ» to have Mr. Craft
with you now, at this very instant?"
1 asked.
"Under the same circumstance?
wouldn't you?" inquiringly replied the
lonely bride.
â¢ 1 hen why were you so cruel as to
leave him behind?"
"Cruel? Why didn't he follow me?"â
and that is the reflection torn of the
"no end of darn good fun" Helen Wild
er promised herself on her solitary
honeymoon.
The girl who in her desire to be "dif
ferent" evolved this last orange blos
som trimmed acrean of the dying â  en
tury Is not fair to look upon. Her per
sonality and her character are at outs.
Hers is the hard ned face of the typi
cal Yankee school niarm. All facts, n<>
romance. Her chin is sharp. Her jaws
close with a click. Her cheeks are hol
low. Her brow is stubborn. Her thin.
brown hair, lusterless and straight, is
worn short, thus depriving her of the
enhancing effects of woman's crowning
glory. Altogether it is a face that re
pels, at first, only to finally attract and
ultimately fascinate by the mind that
shines out of a pair of clear gray eyes.
Mrs. Craft is of medium height and
])Â»â¢!â¢ form is slight but sinewy.
Her flat, swaggering shoulders are in
perfect harmony with the masculine de
termination of her jaw, though her thin
restless hands with ten nails gnawed
to the quick contradict the wooden ex
pression of the face in repose.
It is a charming spot where Jfcrs.
Craft is spending her strange honey
moon. The situation is ideal and the
cottage romantic Low and rambling,
the house stands in the midst of-, a wild
garden, sweet with the scent of honey
suckle and roses, and gay with the
patches of vivid red of the flowering
geranium that blossoms over the fence
into the roadside.
I found the groomless bride looking
very unhoneymoony in a cool white
dress relieved only by a knot of bril
liant hued ribbon fastened at the throat
and a belt of rich, warm tones spiin
ning the supple, stayless waist. She
did not strike me as being madly happy
in that reckless fashion brides have. It
would be quite possible for her to roam
the world over with her left hand un
gloved, Haunting the new, plaii^, gold
band on her third finger to a curious
world and no one would ever think of
rice and old slippers.
"\vhy did you do\tP" I asked.
"Because it is romantic," said the
bride who had left -ier husband be
hina her. '"I had always said I
would not do as other girls have done.
Many years ugo I decided upon this
style of a honeymoon and I am Just
c?.n-ying out my prearranged plans
to the very letter. I expected to have
a darn good time."
"My ways are not the ways of the
world. I have had considerable no
toriety and I am tired of it. What I
have done is not odd, though I will ad
mit I am eccentric."
"Eccentric?" said I. "What do you
mean?" ft
"Well. I'm not li* other girls. Iâ
stay home nights."
The eccentricity of Mrs. Craft's
honeymoon is only equaled by the un
usual circumstances surrounding her
wedding. Hhe tells the tale in the plain
est, most matter-of-fact way, alto
gether undisturbed by the striking
melodramatic situations and the thrill
ing climaxes. The man whose future
life she intends to "boss" she refers to
cither in the most formal manner as
Mr. i 'raft, or indefinitely as "he." As
for herself, she admits that to be called
Mrs. daft was at first startling and
disturbing, although now she is thor
oughly reconciled to it.
"I never told a soul about my wed
ding," said the Honolulu heiress in
even, unfaltering tones â "not even my
mother. I have always done just as I
liked to, and I was not going to change
when it came to a question so closely
affecting me as my marriage. I met
Mr. Craft, who Is a Seattle man, when
I was going down home last October.
He is a splendid business man. and
soon made his presence felt in the isl
and. We became engaged. I did not
worry about the wedding, for I knew
when the time came matters would ad
just themselves."
"On the evening of May 15 we went
ouc riding an' 1 in the course of our
conversation decided we would get
married that night. It was midnight
when we had completed all our plana.
We went to the home of the license
clerk, roused him and got our license.
Then we went and awoke the Rev.
J. Nua. He performed the ceremony
in the chapel of the Theological Sem
inary. There were no lights ana Mr.
Nua was not completely dressed.
After we had spoken the fateful worda

rled. At 10 the same morning T
sailed for San Francisco.
"Mr. Craft was down to see me off,
but so were my family and my friends.
According to arrangements my solitary
honeymoon was to last thirty days. Mr.
â¢ 'raft will now soon be up here.
"No, no one was let into the secret,"
Mrs. Craft went on to tell, "only Just
the necessary witnesses, and I won't
give their names. I made my marriage
public when I got here. Honolulu prob
ably knows it by this time. I wonder
what they are saying down there?"
Mrs. Craft broke into the recital of
the exciting details of her wedding
with many timely bits of business in
formation concerning her dearly be
loved Hawaii. She quoted the market,
explained a recent wondrous sugar
deal, dwelt upon the shiftlessness of the
natives, applauded what America had
done for her land and paid glorious
tribute to annexation. She also took
exception to many "unkind things"
that had been published about her
apropos of her splendid, noble work as a
Bpeclal oWlcer of the Humane Society
and waxed Indignant when Bhe recalled
that It had been stated that sho
strutted round In a blue coat with brass
buttons and was In the habit of placing
handcuffs upon those who In her judg
ment were guilty of cruelty to animals.
The glow that was lacking when she
â poke of Mr. Craft spread In warm,
glad waves over her entire personality
when she discussed her humane work.
"It took me Just ten minutes to raise
1700 for the Humane Society fund," she
cried, "and I never wear a blue coat
except on parade and I never put hand
cuffs on any man- I Just tap him on
the shoulder and say, 'Follow me.' That
is all that Is necessary, he follows."
It is not astonishing that Helen
Wilder was so completely prepared to
indulge, at only a few hours' notice, in
a solitary honeymoon. Twice before
she came near doing the same thing.
A little more than two years ago Miss
Wilder decided, with the aid of George
Semmes, a paymaster in the United
States navy to enjoy the manifold
pleasures of a solitary bridal tour.
"A short time before the day set for
the wedding I discovered that he got
darn drunk and ate opium. That set
tled him, and I was thankful for a
lucky escape," explained the lady.
"Then I engaged myself to Frank Un
ger. That waÃ a foolish thing to do.
In the first place, I am young and he
Is oldâ fifty-twoâ and anyway, he is too
much of a bohemian to make any.
woman happy. I am a bit of a bo
hemian myself, butâ" and the way her
jaw set and her eyes flashed, further
speech was rendered unnecessary;
"Tou tired of linger?** I unceremoni
ously asked.
The abrupt frankness that 1b char
acteristic of the woman would not per
mit her even a tiny white lie to hide
behind.
"No; I did not change my mind. It's
a woman's privilege â not a man's â but
I didn't. I broke, the engagement,
though."
While Mrs. Craft Is lolling away her -
thirty days of grace, surrounded by
friends and with a scrapbook at her
elbow filled from cover to cover with
snappy stories about herself, she does
not seem to worry how Mr. Craft is
enjoying his end of the honeymoon.
"And what do you suppose Mr. Craft
Is doing?" I asked.
"oh! He Is busy, I suppose," she
said. LOUISE VEILLBR.18
THE "GIRLS ABOUT TOWN" MAKES FIRST DASH AT SOCIETY
Death of the Grerr\or\a
AFTER studying the violin for
twenty-five years, and spending
several thousand dollars in foreign
travel to complete this investiga
tion," an experienced musician
said to me recently, "the fact confronts
me, as well as the musical world, that
there is not on earth to-day a perfect
viclin. Most of the old Cremonas extant
I have tested, but as these have all had
to be rebared and renecked in the attempt
to bring them up to modern pitch re
quirements, they have npmpsarily all been

adjustment originally designed by their
makers. an<l so are, consequently, Imper

RACING PIGEONS LATEST FAD OF EASTERN SPROTS
HOMING pigeon races are the lat
est among Eastern sportsmen. It
is not a cheap sport to indulge
in, but it is said that the excite
ment 1h greater even than a prize-fight.
That is. for those -who care for the
TYPE OF HOMING PIGEON USED FOR RACING
"As the violin is considered the foun
tain of all instrumental structure, I put
forth the plea that somo concerted action
should be taken by those interested to
perfect the violin. In doing this all in
struments played with the bow will, of
necessity, be improved, as their funda
mental principles are identical.
"The fust step in the solution of this
problem is to abandon all the misinforma
tion contained in the books on \iolin
making, and also the advice of the violin
makers and repairers, for these men all
follow the books, consequently not one
violin worthy the name has been or ever
will be made by them so long as these
errors are persisted in.
"Two hundred years of their gross stu
pidity in thus blindly following these de
lusions, with no results whatever, should
be enough to prove the truth of my posl
sport. There are some people who like
the game of chess and there are some
who do not.
Several thousand well known sports
men of Chicago have already taken up
pigeon racing. To those who are not
interested in the sport it seems as if
the greatest part of the fun must come
in making mathematical calculations.
There la a good deal of this to be done
when it is necessary to calculate the
time occupied by a pigeon in crossing
from one point on the map to another.
In pigeon races the distances to take

however, is not popular because the

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL,, SUNDAY, JUNE 25, 1899.
f^y AN FRANCISCO is all right. I've
been here now just two days,
v J and am almost ready to swear
r^y off on New York.
â * I got in Thursday night, tired
and, as naturally follows, cross.
Kate and Jack came over to meet me
at a close-to-town station they call
Sixteenth street. Jack is Kate's bro
ther, but I am not going to weary you
writing about him. A shrimp, my
dear; looks 20, is in reality 28; a feeble
imitation of one of our "chappies" â
let's dismiss him.
Kate looks awfully well. She is
twenty-six. 1 wonder how she man
ages it? It must be the hills and the
climate and the flowers and the tactful
scarcity of chaperonsâ and the com
fort. There is nothing like these homes.
A little gaudy and overcrowded as to
furnishings, but all electric buttons and
telephones. Why, you can "hello" all
day and never feel the expense.
You don't expect me to describe the
place. Descriptions are not in my line.
Anyhow, the only thing I noticed was
the unlimited number of cable cars.
But I tell you what I am going to do â
turn historian. Kate's uncle entertains
me at dinner with the history of all the
neighbors. It is absorbingly interest
ing. They haven't a grandmother to
share among them. Kate's people
have a family album, but I learned to
day that the uncle, with his well-dusted
memory, made all his money in a mar
ket poultry stand. : ; ; ' '.
I have seen any number of mutual
'friends. The first man I bumped into
was Herman, looking as jovial and
rubicund as usual. "This is a great
place, little girl," hu> said to me. "I'll
take you 'round and show you some of
It before you go home. Some day when
you feel gay I'll tak..- you up to Tamal
pais."
If I were Mrs. Herman I'd make him
wear a life preserver. Don't you know
they say he has fallen into another and
altogether different well? He never
mentioned the accident to me at all â
just referred to a friend from the
South with blazing hair and asked if I
did not think Anna was a sweet name.
Writing of blazing hair recalls that
Jennie was one of the first girls to call
ticn. 1 take this decided stand only in

WHAT SHE SPENT IN CHARITY
A LADY living lesa than a -lay's jour
ney from New York had the
curiosity the other day to make
certain calculations in order to
see how large ;i part of her prop
erty she would have had to sacri
present the owners are training their
birds and are quite well satisfied with
the results. The fanciers who live in
Oakland and Alameda are the most ac
tive in the work and have been training
for several weeks.
The work of training begins by tak
ing the young birds from their lofts
a short distant* into the country. They
are released and allowed to fly home
This they do with the neatest Bpeed
never stopping for anything. After a
few weeks c birds wore taken on one
of the ferry-boats and released in the
middle of the bay. This is always
somewhat Confusing to the young birds
and for some minutes they fly around
aimlessly before starting home. It is
difficult to make calculations on this
kind of a ] cc, as there is no telling
how much time the bird may consume
before making the start.
After the birds are well trained it is
the intention of the fanciers from this
part of the St. te to make a long dis
tance test, iie birds will first be taken
to Fresno and released at a certain
time, which will be tel-graphed to the
fanciers who are waiting at the lofts
for the birds to return. This waiting
is very excitinar to those interested and
all sorts of bets can be made as to
which bird will corro in first.
In making the final calculations of
the time occupied by the birds it will
be necessary to make all sorts of meas
urements. A sort of logarithm of the
course will be made ami on this will be
based all t rest. Wind will also have
to be considered. If this is against the
hirds they will have to be given a time
allowance in accordance with its veloci
ty. It is calculated that the birds will

this city in about art hour and a half.
If the rare from Fresno proves a suc

south, and after a few more trials as
far as I.os Angeles or San Diego. The
sport, bids fair to become most popular
here, and in a few years may rival the

says she Is really engaged to Fred Nim

Jennie brought her mother with her,
and 1 tell you I admire that girl's cour

mother told me of her coming-out party
and how she and the "Cap'ain" had de

champagne. "The first glass I tasted
I felt sure I was bunkoed!" she ex
plained. "I called to Jennie and said:
'It tickles up your nose, just like sody
water. Is that all right, child?' Jennie
said It was and we paid the bill."
Emma and Francis have been asking
after all the girls. Tell them for me,
will you? I am told Frances Is never

athletics completely. How do you think
they made their money? But never

Houdini in His
Weirdest Trick
of Chewing

seems easy, doesn't it? Of course you

Houdinl, the wonder, who has been

for ;i private committee of seekers into

accomplished with his audience close

palming or getting rid of the needles
in the clothes.
Houdini takes from the audience any
number of needles they may see fit;
places them in his mouth and proceeds
to crunch them. You can hear the steel
crush and snap under his iron teeth. A
light is held close tv his face in order
that no detail of the trick may escape
th^ committee. He opens his mouth
and the needles have disappeared.
He Is then Riven a lone; piece of white
linen thread, peculiarly knotted by
some one of the committee for future
identification; one end of this he places
in his mouth and begins swallowing.
This operation iP continued until only
the smallest particle of an end. is visible

Of course it is a .ere trickâ so says
Houdini â but how docs he do it?
It is claimed by some who profess to
know, that by filling. the stomach with
breadstuff*, needles may be actually
and safely eaten, and after the trick is
over a little drink of ipecac docs the
rest. But if Houdini does really swal
low the needles. h<Â«w does he manage
to palm a reserve supplyâ to say noth

further bringing up the string with the
needles all neatly threaded. ,
Houdini has a remarkable anatomy
anyway, besides his skill as a magician.
Just as a bit of pastime he showed the
committee a vanishing pencil trick that

SALT la the salvation of the town
of Hennessey, Oklahoma.
Three times this year have
waterspouts and cyclones coma

on the prairie and three times has a
charpe of salt, fired from an old Arm

turbers out of business. An Instant

they would soon cease to exist, because
other towns, not many miles away,
have periodical visits from cyclones and

a pile of kindling wood in its wake. On
these people the resident of Hennessey
smiles In pity and asks "Why don't

what the cyclone would destroy."
Of all the experiments to which any
Anglo-Saxon ever resorted that of sav
ing a city by salt must be conceded to
be the queerest.
John Khoades, who figured conspicu
ously as one of the Rough Riders be

of the scheme and he intends to Install

put up the small amount necessary to
equip and maintain the plant.
Rhoades got his idea of the scheme
from hearing an nld sea captain tell
h'Av he had saved his ship from de
struction by firing a load of shot into
a waterspout. "If a ship can be saved
that way," thought Rhoades, "why not
a town?" The more he thought of the
plan the more feasible it s'emed.
He made, his first trial with a shot
gun on one of the tiny dust whirlwinds
eating the general form of a pair of
dumb-bells.
When the cornstarch, like the -wheat
starch, has been washed clear of all
other elements, every grain, to the far
thermost ' millionth, instead of being
round, is angular, full of corners, the
flat body of the grain usually show
ing from five to six sharr> angles. In
the center of th<Â» grain the lines are not
circular, as in the wheat, but straight,
starting from a well defined spot In the
heart of the grain <rt starch and radi
ating out in perfectly straight line?,
from three to five or six lines in each
grain.
Each one of these â¢-. '...s is inclosed
In a wall of cellulose. The character
of the starch on the interior of each is
precisely the same, whether of corn or
w'.eat. In the whoiit flour, however,
as nature has given i^ to man in the
â wheat kernel, there is just the right
proportion of starch for the needs of
the hu ti system, mixed with other
Ingredients which go to give the sys
tem its strength.
When the men who want to adulter
ate their flour find that wheat costs $1
and corn 25 cents a bushel, it is a very
natural thing, following the bent of a
crooked mind, to mix the corn starch
â with the flour starch. The two are of
precisely the same character as to ap
pearance, etc.
But the detective is there, too and,
aided by that chief of all detectives.
Mother Nature, the scientific chemist
takes the adulterated flour, washes it
In cold water fo that every part of the
gluten of the flour is cleared out. and
then, placing a tiny portion of the flour
or, as It now stands, starch, in a little
tube, he puts it in a solution, colors it
â¢with iodine a beautiful purple, puts a
drop between the thin pieces of glass
for his slide, tucks it under the micro
scope and there, swimming together
side by side cs purpla as a sunset In
the land of the midnight sun. are the
two types of starch grains, hundreds
of themâ the one round, the other an
gular, the one having concentirc rings
on its interior, the other with lines as
Jagged as the greenish radiations from
a fractured pane of glass.
It Isn't a question of theory, but one
of very cold, hard fact. The scientific
chemist, especially the agricultural
chemist, such a one as Professor Harry
Snyder of the State experimental sta
tion of the College of Agriculture In
thÂ» I'niverslty of Minnesota, doesn't
that during the lummer months blow
Incessantly over the prairie*. The first
â hot was a success. The whirlwind
ee&sed instantly.
This oonvinced Rhoades that he had
â¢ great idea and he at once resolved to
try it on a large scale. He procured an
old signal cannon, a supply of powder
and shot and went out on the prairie to
a place where cyclones and waterspouts
were of frequent occurrence. He did
not have long to wait. A. monster cy
clone soon came that if allowed free
progress would have wiped cannon and
Rhoades both out of existence. He took
accurate aim and biased away when
the twister was not more than 100 feet
off.
The effect was magical for the cy
clone turned Into a gentle zephyr before
the smoke from the cannon had faded
away.
Of course this proved the theory a
success, but the scheme still lacked
practicability, for it would hardly do
to fire shot around a populous neigh
borhood. What else could he use?
Instantly it flashed across Rhoades'
mind that salt was frequently used as
a projectile when it was not desired to
be effective for more than a short dis
tance. In fact, salt is the farmer's
friend when his apple orchard Is in
danger from tramps. The concussion Is
a severe one, but no serious wounds re
sult.
A trial of about ten pounds of salt
convinced Rhoades that he had what he
wanted. The first shot had a greater - 4
effect on the cyclone than the leaden
bullets had had and there was no rip
ping up of the ground or surrounding
vegetation. It was safe to try on a
town.
Then Rhoades took the apparatus to
Hennessey and offered to install a plant

was accepted.
Only one trial was necessary to con
vince the people of the efficacy of
Rhoades' scheme. One cyclone that
seemed to be going right out of its path

into nothing with four pounds of com
mon powder and ten pounds of salt. Of
course Rhoades was given a banquet

IS THIS ADULTERATED FLOUR
HARMFUL.'
A good many people have asked this
question, but the answers have been, in
many cases, quite vague â just such in
definite answers as would be apt to
suit the man who is adulterating.
There are three main elements in
tb? wheat flour which make it the staff
â ft life when it becomes bread â ash, for
the formation of bone: starch for the
h**at of the body: gluten, or. in another
word, protein, f'>r the production of
muscle. The gluten is made up of two
substances, gluten and gliadin. The
gliadin binds the flour together and
makes it dough, the gluten prevents
the dough from becoming soft and
sticky. The gluten as a whole is the
life-giving part of the bread. Now, sup
pose the man who gets his corn for 25
cents a bushel puts 40 per cent more
starch into his flour than he ought to,
corn starch. The man who eats bread
made from this adulterated flour is
robbed of 40 per cent of the life-giving
powers of the bread, for the incoming
starch drives out the gluten. Very
many Americans use bread as the
staple of their diet. Professor Snyder
has demonstrated, by experiments upon
men in feeding them for days at a time
certain lines of food, to arrive at what
is a reasonable ration for a man of
work, that a man must have, where he
has but little meat and not many vege
tables, at least two pounds of bread per
day.
This must be honest bread, made from
the vesy best of flour, containg not
less than 12 per cent of gluten. In case
any pc-r cent of this gluten is driven out
to that extent the man's dietary is im
paired. Suppose you were living on
largely a bread diet, as so many Ameri
can laborers are, they and their fam
ilies. If suddenly and without any
knowledge of the fact â for the adul
terated Hour cannot be told by its ap
pearance from the pure â your bread be
came from 15 to 40 per cent, or even in
some cases 50 per cent impoverished,
how long before your strength and the
strength of your family would show the
effects? And whether you are a Tabor
ing man or not, a very large part of
your food is mad* up from bread or
other articles of diet in which flour is
used, and to the extent that this flour
is adulterated with this corn starch to
that extent you are robbr-d
that have periodical altercations with
cyclones.
Since the departure of Rhoades the
Board of Trustees of the town of Hen
nessey has put the cyclone-destroying
business on a scientific basis.
A tall wooden tower has been built in
the center of town, from the top of
which It Is possible to look over the
country for miles around. Near the
outskirts of the town are a nuYnber of
cannon, and in a small house near by
piles of cartridges of powder and salt.
A man remains on watch at the top of
the tower at all hours. At the bottom
of the tower a horse is kept saddled.
When a cyclone or waterspout Is seen
coming, the man in the tower rushes
down, jumps on the horse and gallops
to the nearest cannon. Hastily ram
ming in a cartridge, the gunner gets a
bead on Mr. Cyclone, and when the ter
ror Is about 200 feet away, Ores. That
settles the cyclone and the citizens at
once have a jubilee and buy the man
drinks. The people are all happy and
know they have a bonanza in the can
non that shoots salt and protects them
from cyclones.
Interesting as the case of saving a
town from cyclones by salt may be
from an economic standpoint, it is
much more co from a scientific one. A
positive statement as to what phenom
The Oldest Wooden Church in the World.
NEARLY 700 years ago the first
Christian missionaries established
themselves in the neighborhood of
Borgund. Norway, and at once
built a church. The structure was
of rough wooden logs held together
by pops and dovetailed joints,
still standing to-day as good al
This is conceded to be the oldest
in all Norway, and many scholars go so
far as to say that it is the oldest in tha
northern part of Europe. Even the Rus
sian churches must take a second place
in point of age. There is little doubt but
that it is the oldest wooden church in the
world.
At a first glance the old wooden church
seems to be all root'?. The ground floor
of the structure is a long, low colonnade.
Above this rise two rows of roofs cover
ing the side naves. Another roof covers
the center naves and crowning all is a
conglomerate peak of heavy timbers and
thick shingles. The entire exterior of the
structure is thickly' grown with bright
green mess. The shingles are ornamented
with all sorts of emblems that In days
gone by meant worlds to the hearts of
all good Norsemen.
In the days when the old church was
built the block house was the general
type of architecture in the northern part
of Europe. Naturally it would be ex
pected that this style of architecture
would prevail, but it does not. In fact
there is hardly a trace of it to be seen.
The interior arrangement shows a row
of posts set upright and held together by
heavy woodwork. On these posts the
frame of the church is sol. There are
really two parts to the interior of the
church. These might be called the choir
and the "high church." The choir is the
smaller ami terminates in an oval altar
niche. There are three naves on the in
side of the church, the middle one being
the higher. In general construction this
suggests the Roman Basilica.
There are three places of entrance to
this quaint old wooden church. All are
of magnificent proportions and grand de
sign. But the most wonderful of all is
the carving with which the doors are or
namented. This is really creditable work
and a close examination shows the work
was done with axes.
On entering the church the visitor Is
impressed with a senso of gloom and has
to grope Jus way about. An examination
shows that this is due to the fact that
there arc no windows to speak of. only
a row of holes extending around the up
per walls where they join the roof. There
are no shutters, glass or window frames.
Winter and summer the holes are open
so that the ventilation is perfect.
The result of this sanitary arrangement
is that the people of the district do not
go to church in the winter season, which
Is equivalent to saying that they do not
go to church more than a small part of
the year. And yet the services are held
regularly whenever the priest comes to
the parish. But he preaches to an empty
house when the people think it i 3 too cold
to go to church.
In other ways, besides a lack of heating
arrangements, is the church careless of

cause no scientific Investigations have
ever been made on these lines. The
most Interesting point lies in the fact
that the salt is so much more effective
than solid shot. Salt being a solid, Its
Impact against the tower of water
would be sufficient to cause disruption
of the lines of force. But the salt ap
pears to do more than this. It seems
to act in a chemical capacity as well
and thereby entirely dissipates the
moving body.
Dr. Ernest Plllsbury, acknowledged
to be one of the best chemists in the
State, considered the phenomenon a
most Interesting one and well worthy
of careful investigation.
"There Is no telling Just what hap
pens," he said, "when the salt comes in
contact with the moving wall of water.
From all that wt know of chemistry
the salt striking the water with great
force would be absorbed by ft to a cer-
tain extent and form a hydrochloric
acid. The soda of the salt would form
a sodium hydrate, and possibly some
unstable gases might be liberated. But
beyond this nothing can be definitely
Btated, because It is a field that has
never been studied. It may ba that we

through any great change under the
circumstances, it will undoubtedly show
that force has more to do with the
formation of chemical atoms than we
have been wont to believe."
Professor H. Leon Van der Nalllen.
of the School of Engineering, thought
that the destruction of the waterspout
by firing salt into it was due almost fn
tirely to mechanical force.
"When the salt is traveling through
the air," said Professor Van der Nall
len, "It is only natural to suppose that
there is a vacuum behind it. On its im
pact with the waterspout the lines of
force are broken, there is a sudden
check and the water and air rush Into
the vacuum, causing a perfect disrup
tion of the moving mass. On firing Into
a cyclone the effect would be much the
same. It may be that some gases are
liberated, but Just what they are or
how they act on the cyclone it 1b not
an easy matter to state."
Several scientlflo men In the city
could give no explanation whatever of
the phenomenon. It was a surprise and
a revelation to th*m, and all they could
say was that It should be Investigated.
But the people of Hennessey are not
asking for investigations. They are
only too glad that their town Is being
protected from cyclones and water
spouts and are perfectly willing that It
should be saved by salt.

the district revere their old church, for It
Is the only one of its kind in the world.

YANN NIBOR, THE
GREAT SAILOR POET
THE sailors' poet, Yann Nibor, has
lately been the recipient of high
honors In the French capital, and
among his warmest admirers
may be mentioned the famous
writers. Pierre Lot!, Jules Clare
tie and others whose names are as
household words In France. They have
paid the warmest tribute to his works,
"Chansons et Recits de Mer" and "Nos
Matelots." *
Not long ago, rinding myself in Paris.
I met the editor of the Vieux Corsaire
of St. Malo, in which I had frequently
read Nibor's poems. I remember Reeling
a great emotionâ a feeling causing "true
tears" to follow reading "La Boite de
Chine," "Les Alfcatross" and "Les
Quatre Freres et I' Ella." I had never
read anything so realistic or graphic,
where the elision constantly repeated
of the final vowels gives such a truthful
ringâ rude though it may beâ to the song
of the sailor. I told the editor of my
great desire to make Nibor's acquain
tance. "Nothing easier," was his prompt
reply. "I will go to the Navy T>epart
tnent where this poet is employed, and
!f he can get nwfv wp will breakfast to

Mrs. Aenlle thoupht discretion the bet
ter part of valor and refused to go. But
1 was determined, and with the wife of
a : aval olflper started for the station, ac
companied by our husbands and friends,
who begged us to give up the trip.
At the station we met General Paterno,
who Informed us that Aguinaldo was ill.
ihal it would be Impossible for us to see
him that day, and fur us to await a more
favorable Um< .
A few days before, while entertaining
us In his own home, he said that h>>
hoped the insurgents and Americans
would be friendly, "for." he added,
"the natives are not able to govern, to
withstand foreign Invasion, and need pro
tection; but Aguinaldo feels differently,
and wants to see the islands free.!'
But upon the day that we met Paterno
at the station he seemed Indeed changedâ
polite, but not gracious, and showed no
disposition to talk.
My prophetic soul seemed to say now
or never, nnd so we decided to go, and
were conducted to our train by I'aterno,
who afterward sat in the car occupied
by the insurpent generals. After talking
very earnestly with them for a few niln
me to us and said. "I would ad
vise you not to go, for in the last few
days some very strict rules have been
made by the insurgents about foreigners
passlr.c through thÂ«- interior."
our friends crowded about nnd urged
us to give it up. while they regaled us
with horrible tales of insurgent treach
ery. They told us how Senor Quiles,
brother, wife and child wore murdered;
how they first bound the parents, then
cut the child to pieces right before their
eyes. They told us of a photographer
A quarter of an hour later M. Bourdas
returned in company with Nibor, who is
a powerfully built man of commanding
appearance. He Is tall and straight as
an Indian. He wore a black overcoat
and a very' high silk hat. He possesses
an energetic head, eyes of somewhat
hard expression with changing tints, a
large mouth with thin lips, denoting
.â¢>â¢ of purpose, tempered by a kind
ly expression when he laughs, showing
th whitest of teeth. His hair is short
and harsh looking.
Yann Nibor seasoned our repast with
racy gossips of St. Malo. When the des
sert was put on the table he recited in
his rich and sympathetic voice the pa
thetic poem, "Quatre Sabots de Noel,"
followed soon after by "Honneur et
I'atrie." One would have thought that
v tr:Un of powder had caught fire in the
neighborhood so great was the enthus
iasm and excitement of the people din
ing at the adjoining table, for tumultu
ous applause followed.
The following day Yann Nibor and
some friends called upon me at my hotel.
"What a pity it is." I said, "that you are
not a member of the Comedie Francaise,

who was taken prisoner while on a trip
to the interior and that no one ever saw
him again.
Senor Aenlle, after conversing with Pa
terno, insisted that we remain, and as the
train moved off he shouted at us. "On no
account leave the train."
After starting we concluded to go to the
third station and to take the next train
back.
Everywhere the train stopped the door
to our compartment was rudely opened
by fiendish looking- Insurgent guards.
They thought we. were spies and looked
at us with malignant scowls.
One after another would come up, open
the door, peep in, then close it with a
bans until my friend was on the verge
of hysteria.
At the third station we got out, but
were informed that we might proceed to
Malolos. which was the station nearest
Apuinaldo's quarters. Just what Paterno
said to convince the suspicious insurgent
officers that we were not s Mes will per
haps never be known.
But when we arrived at Malolos, the
two generals offered us their arms, and
conducted us to th<- caramettes with all
the courtly airs of the ball room, knowing
that we were the wives of their enemies.
Now thai was chivalry lnd< cd. The
caramette is a two wheeled vehicle built
for two.
My friend and I occupied the first car-
Rmette and led the procession. 1 confess
I felt just a little bit nervous, and the

was his energetic reply. "Would you
like to pee the conventional manner In
which I would have to deliver my song^
If I were there? Well, listen."
Nibor then adui.i.i: a pose suggestive
of Talma, and us.d the classic empl
so dear tr> celebrated tragedians. The
accent was Intentionally stagy, unnat
ural and cloying.
"Well, madame," said he, in an almost
harsh voice, when he had i ncluded the
little comedy, "you ' ir 'Mnthu

"How T would like Sarah Bernhardt to
hear you," I exclaimed to Nibor.
"It would pive m" pleasure, too. Sev
eral of my friends have promised me an
Introduction to her, and not one of them
has bo far kept his word," and he smiled
philosophically.
"Well, 1 will make no promise, but if
it plei-.-s you we will po and see her at

"Hut 1 am not In evening dress." he
replied.
"Do not let that trouble you," I an
swered. "Sarah will listen to you with

On our arrival at the theater 1 had
the pleasure of presenting Yann Nib< r
ar.ri r-'ur escort to the pr<-at Bernhardt.
I still see in my mind's eye Nibor
advancing to take the outstretched hand
which shi proffered him. He took it al
most awkwardly, holding himself very
erect, He was polite, but did little bow

I suggested.

saM Sarah, in those mellifluous tones,
which caused Victor Hugo to say that
she possessed "a voice of gold," and
adds: "Please speak; do not sing."
He approached near her, and in a sim

until our heads touched the top of the
caramette, and then before we had pro
ceeded four hundred yards a guard ad
vanced and cried out "Alto!"
The guards were dressed in blue and
white striped uniforms and looked for the
world like convicts with their fiendish
leering faces, made more formidable, by
the plare of firearms.
"Qulenes?" he shouted again. We were
so badly scared that the little Spanish
that we could speak they could not under
stand, and no wonder, for in woman
fashion we were both trying to explain
at the same time, first who we were. HlÂ«
countenance showed, no sign of compre
hension. We were terrified and alone.
By some interruption the procession had
stopped and Paterno was away in the
rear.
Then I happened to hit upon the magic
word "Paterno," and pointed back
toward his caramette.
"Adelante. pasen vos," the guard an
nounced, and once again we were bounc
ing over the road In trembling and fear.
Time after time we were halted by the
word "Alto" and wished with all sincer
ity that we had remained at home.
We stopped at the Hotel Independen
cia, where Paterno served us with
refreshments, then excused himself, as he
wished to confer with Aguinaldo. He left
us in the charge of Dr. Herez. who has
since deserted the Filipino cause and Is
now a surgeon in the American Hospital
at Manila.
We were eyed with evident curiosity by
the natives, and after two hours Paterno

Steeple-climber," known in every-day
lif- as F. s. Sutherland, late of the
United S;;ue.s navy.
Sutherland is really a marvel, and his
remarkable feats of dizzy climbing
?nnm almost uncanny. He has a pe
culiar contrivance of his own invention
âstrange corrugated rubber coverings
for the hands and feetâ which, by"Hhe
aid of an air pump, become possessed
of wonderful suction power at the will
of the wearer. With this apparatus the
man is transformed into the fly and can
climb at any angle, to any height and
on any material that will bear his
weight- He must have nerve, however,
and he must keep going up. These suc
tion feet and hands, when first struck
against the wall, possess ample ad
hesive power to hold the weight of the
wearer, but in a few seconds the suc
tion relaxes and a second attack must
be made.
If the wearer uses his hands and feet
alternately a? in climbing a ladder, he
is perfectly safe: for as one hand or

change in position is imperative, inas
much that if the climber remains sta

the hands and feet simultaneously and

We were much surprised at this, be
cause he had informed us at Manila that
Aguinaldo was ill, and a much greater
surprise was still in store for us. We
crossed over from the hotel to the old
stone convent, the President's headquar
ters, and found a great crowd assembled
in the audience chamber.
The people had gathered to witness a
fencing contest. Aguinaldo sat in the
center of the platform, just back of the
performers, while his Cabinet occupied
Zeats on cither side.
The fencing was excellent, and the au

learned rapidly the music of the church
and ofttimep was obliged to leave his
school to Blng at a funeral, and when
he returned to his home was proud and
happy to give his parents thi- payment
he had received. From these elementary
studies he acquired the faculty of sink

With the tobacco-crowing industry the

Now the industry does not need any out

majority of the Cuban soldiers who have
returned to work are growing tobacco.
The great influx of capital through the

AN OLD-TIME
SONG WRITER
SEPTIMUS WINNER, who wrote
"Listen to the Mocking Bird" and
other standard American melodies,
celebrated his seventy-second birth
day the other day at his home in
Philadelphia.
Mr. Winner makes no pretension of hav
in? been a writer or composer of classical
music, but he has written compositions
which have thrilled American audiences.
He occupies the unique position of having
been the only author that wrote a. sons?
which was suppressed and its author
threatened with imprisonment.
The greatest of all his melodies, in point
of circulation and merit, was "The Mock
ing Bird," written almost 50 year* ago,
and which has been translated into the
languages of the principal nations of the
earth. Its effect as a revenue producer to
the author lost its worth many years ago,
a? the copyright had expired. Some other
selections which Mr. Winner composed
were "Whispering Hope." "What Is Home
Without a Mother?" "Ten Little Inns."
and "Give Us Back Our Old Commander."
It was a few days after General Burn
side had superseded McClellan in the
command of the Army of the Potomac
that the "Give Us Back Our Old Com
mander" was composed by Mr. Winner.
He received his inspiration from the out
burst of popular indignation which was
sweeping over the land, particularly
among the soldi of the Army of the
Potomac, in opposition to the removal of
McClelland The latter, about four, weeks
before, had beaten General Lee at Antle
tam. and a few days afterward 100,000 sol
diers sang the song while marching along
the Rappahannock on their way to Fred
ericksburg, when disastrous defeat over
took them. "Give Us Back Our Old Com
mander" could be heard at night from one
end of the Union lines to the other, and
at Chancellors\-iUe. where Hooker dis
played his Inability to cope successfully
with Lee. it was sung with renewed
vigor.
But at this point the commotion created
by the song reached its climax when thÂ«
War Department issued an order sup
pressing its sale and prohibiting the "Ing
ing of it. The Government, however, did
not atop at this, for Julia Mortimer, one
of the greatest of American singers, who
was then filling an engagement at Ford's
Theater, was Informed that imprison
ment awaited her if she- persisted in mak
ing the objectionable song a part of her
role. Actors in Baltimore were enjoined
by the Government from singing It in the
theaters.

Frar.z Ebert, comedian and man of

he has left behind him memories of joy
an 1 gladness, and also the memory of
a number of good jokes on himself.
For Franz Ebert is. always getting into
a certain kind of trouble that very few
other men could get Into even if they
wanted to.
, "While Franz Ebert was in this city
a few years ago, he was under the
watchful eye of Ralph Pincus. And it
was all that Pincus could do to keep
the little fellow out of trouble.
On one occasion, while little Frank
was walking up -Powell street, near th-Â»
recently cremated Baldwin, he was met
by an elegantly dressed lady, who
stopped and asked him what his name
was, thiaking all the time that he was
a small Nov.
"Nichts versteh," replied Franz, try
ing to get out of the way.
"Oh, my, how interesting," ejaculated
the lady. "You are the most lovely
German child I have ever seen in my
life." And before little Franz could
realize just what was going to happen
she grabbed him up in her' arms and
covered his face witn kisses. And the
worst of it was that Franz's brother was
on a car just passing ana saw th whole
performance, "i
On another occasion Franz and some
friends were in Norman's and the lit
tle fellow ordered "em stein." This
paralyzed the waiter, who turned ; to
one of the larger men in the party and
asked if it was all right. He still
seemed a little reluctant, though, about
bringing such a large amount of beer
to so small a youngster, but when he
saw that same youngster put the big
stein to his lips and empty It with
out stocking he nearly fainted. But a
tip brought him to again.
.Franz also went fishing to Tiburon
on the occasion of his stay here, and
of extreme difficulty to pay proper respect
to the dead and join with fitting merri

two beer kegs were converted Into a bier
and the coffined remains deposited upon

circle round the bride and groom, cutting
off from view the grewsome sight and the
further end of the deck
Rev. Potts, dry and grotesque*: appeared
and, taking up his position before the
couple so anxious to be united, proceeded
at once with the imprest.* ceremony.
He had got as far as the solemn warning
and had called out if there was any onÂ©
who had reason to Interrupt the nuptials
to "now speak or else forever 'hold his
peace." when there was an awful crash
at the other end.
The captain's dog and the bulldog had
got into a fight and In the scuffle which
ensued the ccffln was upset and the home
made casket, as it struck the deck, burst
open and the corpse rolled out.
It lay for a moment with upturned face
in the sight of all. It was the body of
James Carter. The bride shrieked, the
bridegroom yelled "For God's sake, go
on." and the company standing before the
unsightly clay form watched as the cere
mony was concluded and James Carson
and Maud Cranston irrevocably bound
until eternity. ,
Then the bride in wild, piercing ac

Carter been given the power to keep his
word and forever separate Maud Cranston
and James Carter?
as luck would have it, he caught the
largest fish of any man in the crowd.
On measurement this fish was found to
be larger than Franz himself.
Franz used to rather enjoy these lit
tle jokes on himself, but there came a
time when he was fooled. Plncus took
him out to the park to see the sights,
all of which were greatly enjoyed by
the little fellow. "When they came to
the children's playeround the man in
charge took a fancy to Franz, and,
thinking him a boy. asked him to ride!
Of course Franz did not want to do
anything of the kind and shook his
head.
The man in charge was not to be out

the shoulders lifted him onto the big
gest mule and held him there, while
the crowd yelled with laughter.
Franz yelled ami kicked, but all to no

â  > Imogen is looking well?"
"Well," hesitated charmianâ "perhaps not."
Lady Chatfleld turned on him a face which was by no means anxious.
"In what way?" she asked; "tell me frankly."
"Oh. well," ht#ltuted Charmian; "1 thought she had a worn, far-away
look, bo to speak."
Lady Chatfleld nodded. ".lust so." she said, without perturbation;
. "that js it precisely. She has got entangled."
"With a man? 1 suggested Charmlan, to show his sympathy.
"A most undesirable person, my dear Lord Francis,' she went on.
â¢â¢''Not only has he not a penny but (what I consider far worse) he Is a
.'rakeâ which I consider far worse." she repeated amiably.
:â¢:â¢.' "So do I," said ('hnrmlan promptly; "we all of us do."
. â â â  . Perhaps if Lady Chatfleld had not been bo deeply engaged In her own
thoughts her eyes might have twinkled: but she continued impassively.
"I have argued with her. but she it as obstinate as a mule. Her father
has. done the Line. It is hopeless. We are obliged to submit." She
paiisc, j. "There Is but one chance."
"What is it?" asked Charmian politely,! supposing that he was intended
to do ho. /
"That she should fall In love with some one else." said Lady Chatfleld.
"A man?" suggested Charmian again.
â¢That le what -â¢ â  me thinking of you." said Lady Chatfleld, without
jMiyini; him any attention;
Lord Francis started. "Me;" said lie In amazement.
"Why not?" aske<) his companion eheerfullv. "You are young and
handsome and have a name. Moreover, I am told you have a reputation
In these affairs."
"My dear lady!" pleaded Charmian.
"Won't you help me? 1 ' Inquired Lady Chatfleld indifferently. "Wean
her from this disgraceful attachment. It Is monstrous to throw away a
girl's life iikn that."
"You want me to marry Imogen?" said Charmlan In dismay.
"No, my dear young man." Raid Lad) I'hatfleld affectionately, "hut I
don't want Imogen to marry some one else.''
Charmian considered, and suddenly a light danced Into his eyes His
glance met Lady Chatfleld's and both broke forth Into soft laughter
"You will do It?" -'i â  asked.
"It nil depends on Miss Imogen." said he smilingly.

"Try. and save the jade."
Charmian was not sure if he could save her. but he had certainly
jnade up bis mind to try. and the first duty that lay upon him was to dis
cover which was Imogen. The house party was large, and he had only
vaguely supposed that Lady Chatfleld owned a daughter. Bui evidently
ph<Â» was Imogen; and Imogen was there. He put hints together and dis
cover, d h->r that evening, discovering also at the same time that be knew
her already. Her name was Langley. 11.- approached her smiling.
"How In the name ,>f all that's honest and respectable and .lust and fair

JÂ»enjrley, is more than I can understand and far more than I can bear"
Bald he.
Miss Lnngley looked at him coolly, and now that he observed her
closely he saw her to 1>- quite handsome.
"Oh have yon been here?" she said abruptly. "I didn't know. "When
did you come?"
"It seems years." said be reproachfully. "But now T have forgotten
that dreary time. I have stared you out of face. I thought, and with no
result. My eyes have taken on a permanent squint through watching
you." " â¢
She Bmiled a little, at this whim leal extravagance, and considered him
with more Interest.
"Well you see. I've only just me to-day; so I must apologize for my
rudeness. 1 didn't come with my mother."
â - Charmian made a little grimace. but he was not at all discomposed.
"Ah. that's a bad planâ a bad plan." said he. shaking his head with grave
impudence; "I always think young girls should slick to their mothers
One never knows what temptations, you know . . ."
His air of deprecation: together with the boldness with which he wholly
Ignored lils dilemma, stirred Miss Langley to laughter. He took a peat by
her .and when she ceased smiling she found his eves fixed earnestly upon
Â her. He dropped them at once, and fidgeted. She was certainly a pretty
, woman.
".;";:.â  "You don't mind my sitting here?" he asked anxiously
â¢-. â¢'why. no of course." said Mis* l.am;|. â¢ wondering.

.-.â¢.. Miss Langley also turned away, and when her glance came back from
- a chattering group In the room Charmian's soft eyes were again resting
â  upon her face, as though they would inhabit there." Miss Langley colored
ever bo slightly, and Charmian dropped his gaze once more with a show of
confusion.
"Come into the garden." paid he abruptly and rising
Miss Langley hesitated. "I â I . . ." she began
"It's quite warm! I'll fetch yon a wrap " -aid he.

her gray eyes. Yet she now appeared to wonder. They passed out by the

yet again, and she stirred uncomfortably.

to renew her confidence. He was delighted.
"My dear Miss Imogen may I call you that?" he asked In his softest
voice

There was a dispute that evening over some question, which pent Char

startled to perceive Mi.^.s Langley.
"I came in with Kir William." she cried, with a little gasp of dismay,
"and now he* li;ih tone; some uno called him."
Charmian thought her very sweet to the eyes. He got off the ladder
on which he was Bitting with a greitt hook on his knee.
"May I offer you this seat?" he said gently. "1 can't find that abomln
fible passage."
"Can't you?" she asked, with a little laugh, In which he Beemed to read
self -consciousness.
"Perhaps you could," he suggested, offering her the volumÂ© bo that
their hands met.
"Iâ l don't think T could," stammered Miss Lanerley.
Charmian's heart smote him; also it gave a Jump and thrilled.

"She's beautiful, I admit." said Charmian. "Butâ
"I think you'll like her very much." she continued.
"I do like her." cried Charmian. "butâ"
"You could have Lahgley, and there Is your place at the Towers, she

"You'd get along very well, I'm sure. Oh, yes, you d like her very

"I'm sure I should beat her," said Charmian.
Lady Chatfield took up her paper. He stood up and strode twice up
and down the room; then meeting her eyes he went off into a fit of laugh
ter. in which his companion good humoredly joined.
"Oh. well," he said, as he left the room, "Imogen Is pretty, and that 8
something."
By the time he- had reached the meadows beyond the park he had con
sidered himself Into quite a cheerful frame of mind. He was not of a
character to take things too solemnly, and In any case the present was
always sufficient for him. So when he encountered Imogen quite by acci
dent In a pied field of buttercups and marsh marigolds he met her with an
eager air.
"Imogen â said he quite easily, and would have drawn her
sharply to him.
She had greeted him with shy satisfaction, but now her cheeks stained
red, and she drew back, a puzzled expression In her eyes.
"I'dâ l'd rather not, Lord Francis," said she awkwardly.
The denial piqued him. "Darling!" he said reproachfully; "and 'Lord
Francis,' too!"
It was nicer and pleasanter than he had imagined.
She grew more embarrassed. "You see," she explained in a lame and
hurried voice, "I'd rather it was kept secret Just now, andâ in that
case, you see you mustn't â mustn't â
"Mustn't I?" he asked in dismay, feeling that his only consolation for
hte situation was slipping from him. ".Upon my soul, Imogen, I don't thir.k
that's fair."
"Well, you see, people mightâ might see," she pleaded, in her agita
tion. "And besidesâ there isn'tâ what Is there Inâ it isn't very much to â "
"Oh. isn't it?" remarked Charmian, seating himself gloomily on a tree
bole, while she stood by, watching him anxiously. "It shows, my dear,
how little you know. Why, it's the one consolaâ that is, the chief pleasure
In meeting you. You will get accustomed to it, believe me," he went on
philosophically, almost in her mother's manner. "You'll get to like It.
I'm sure."
Imogen was hotter than ever and turned away abruptly.
"You're surely not going!" he went on. "Oh, Imogen! When shall I
see you again? Will you sit next me at luncheon?"
"Of course I couldn't do such a silly thing." she said impatiently.
"Well, will you come into the garden with me- after dinner or the con
servatory? And mind, if you speak to that fool Mountesk I shall be angry
with you!"
"You are unreasonable," broke out Imogen indignantly.
"Well, my dear, I have a violent temper of Jealousy, and the sooner
we're married the better." he pursud agreeably. "Upon my soul, I don't
see why we shouldn't be married in â after May, you know."
"Married!" echoed Miss Langley aghast, and In tearful tones. "Iâ I"
"Well, well, think over It and let me know to-morrow," said Charmian
graciously. -â¢ â  .. â _. .. _ ,_ Z..C
Miss LÂ«angley came to him in the evening. She was grave, she was
humble, she was downcast, and she was troubled; and her eyes were
rimmed with a mist of tears.
"I haveâ confession to make to you, Lord Francis," she began in a
low voice. "I wonder ifâ if you can forgive me?"
"Try me, dear," he said flippantly.
"No, no; you will not understand. I have made a mistake"â hur
ried forwardâ "a horrible mistake."
"A mistake!" repeated Lord Francis, wondering what turn affairs
might be taking. â -â¢>â â¢
"I overheard accidentally parts of a talk you had with my mother.

"With my young affections," Bald Charmian dryly; "I see." - - -
There was a silence. It ought to have been a relief, but somehow It
was not to ChariaJan. On the contrary he felt a trifle annoyed. But he
put on his usual pcod humor when he spoke.
"1 hope this will be a lesson to you, Miss Langley," he said solemnly,
"not to â '
"It will beâ lt will be," she promised him tearfully.
"Then that was why you wouldn't let me â "
"Yes, that was why, said Miss Langley very hurriedly.
There was another period of silence. Then you are still engaged, after
all, to Mr.-Mr.-"
"No," she cried, "I never really was. That was true. I only pretended
to be to frighten mother. He was horrid."
"Well," said Charmian more cheerfully, strange to say, "It seems to
me you're quite good at pretending. But If that Is so, It may not be too
late for us. I hope I'm not horrid.
"Oh, no, but you don't understand," she cried In distress, turning her
favorite red. "You see, there is anotherâ one else."
"Ah!" said Charmian, and then, with an inspiration. "Not MoTrateskf 1

He saw the admission In her pretty face.
"Damn!" he said. "I beg your pardon, but I think I've been a fool, and
I think Lord Mountesk will have taken me for one."
"Oh. it Is I, It Is I, who have made you one," she cried penitently.
"My dear Imogen, there is no doubt of that." said Charmian dryly
"You did, but you couldn't have made so big a fool of me if you hadn't had
my assistance."
"Forgive me." she pleaded, lifting an abashed but smiling face.
"I will," he said. "But I'm hanged if I'll forgive Mountesk!"
"But he has done nothing," she exclaimed. "It Is all me."
"That is true," assented Charmian. "Well, I'll forgive you both " Bhe
had the air of restlessnessâ one awaiting her dismissal. "I hope you'll

The Pueblo Indians were probably the original adobe builders.
": : when they began it no man wots of. They are to-day housed
in the 'same structures at Isleta, Laeruna and Acoma in which
their forefathers were discovered nearly four centuries ago. These
tribes seem to have taken their idea of home building from the Aztecs
ar.i aiipted these ideas to the wants and requirements of the new
country. They were to the plains what the cliff dwellers were to the
mountains. These tribes mark the first era of civilization in what
:? now the United States, viz.. when men begin to build houses and
have fixed places of abode. The elaborate ornamentation to be found
:r. Aztec ruins has no counterpart in the style of architecture fol
lowed by the Pueblo Indians, whose houses are severely plain. The
pueblo 5 sometimes seven stories in height and- contains over a

terrace above terrace. The entrance is by means of a iadder. and
hen that "Is pulled up the latchstring is considered withdrawn.
When the Spanish invader came he looked upon the adobe dwelling
of the Pueblo Indian, pronounced it good and proceeded â  1^ adopt
the idea to his own use. The newcomer soon learned the^irt of
mud-brick making, but applied the knowledge to carrying out his
i leas of civilization and built the individual house for the Individual
family. Thus was marked the first step in the evolution of the
pueblo adobe communal town Into the town of streets, houses, parks

roof laid on heavy timbers. The next step in the evolution of the
adobe is the one with walls smoothed and plastered Inside and out
side with cement and modernized by the addition of glass windows
and paneled doors. The next improvement Is the addition of a tiled
roof. In the first stag? â the adobe pure and simple there are but
two rooms, the partition being blankets or cloths hung through the
center and separating the living-room from the sleeping apartment.
No provision Is made for cooking- inside except a sort of pen fire
place. Baking is done in the curious little bake ovens built of adobe
and usually located near the front door. Adobes of this class are
occupied by the poorer classes In cities, while many ranchers out in
the country find them quite adequate to their needs even after they
have become well-to-do. The walls, from three to five feet thick, can
be depended upon to keep out the heat of the sun by day and are a
sure defense from the advances of Jack Frost hv nieht.
If an adobe could be transplanted to New England soil it would
be found to serve its -pose equally well there, and as a comfortable
dwelling in winter to be far superiorâ lf not so artisticâ to the best
built frame house, with its rattlir.g windows and currents and coun
ter-currents of drafts and winds.
In the second and third stages of the evolution of the adobe we
find the counterpart the brick houses- of Eastern cities. Such
buildings as these have mud walls covered by cement and the -interior
divided into as many rooms as suits the convenience, and reach
the dignity of plastered walls and partitions. In these are found all
the household conveniences, such as running water, cooking ranges,
etc. In many instances a ... extends along the front, built
more for comfort than ornamentation.
In the third class we find the neat cottage. In this example the
first story has walls three feet thick of solid adobe; the upper story
is a ght frame covered with ad'-.be cement. Of cohrse the interior is
furnished with every modern improvement and on as elaborate a scale
as the builder cares to pay fnr. There are several cottages of this
style in Santa Fe and many more in and about Los Angeles and other

quite up to the standard. An era of building such palatial adobe man
sions has set in. It certainly is a novelty, and the historic surround
ings and climatic condition combine to encourage it. It is frequently
remarked by newcomers to Southern California that the one thing
lacking to make life more agreeable and pleasant Is the absence of
heat in the houses. It is hard for many persons to understand why
it is possible for one to feel uncomfortably cool when the thermometer
Is registered well up In the seventies or even the eighties. Yet such
Is the case. It is the peculiar characteristic of all arid atmospheres.
The climate of Southern California 13 the desiccated air of the desert,
and that is just why it Is well worth living in. Frame houses ornate
with "â gingerbread" and millwork are pleasing to look at, but the
noonday heat of summer and the night chill of winter strikes through
them as though they were cotton tents. Brickwork and masonry
have proved too damp and otherwise unsuitable for this climate.
Therefore, taking all these :I_--"^ into consideration. It Is not to be
wondered at that adobe housesâ the houses of the country and for tfe*
country â are again in vogue.
Previous to 1553 there was hardly anything other than adobÂ«
houses in Los Angeles, but as may be supposed the adobes of thos<
days were not so skillfully built nor as architecturally beautiful as thÂ«
ones that are being erected to-day.
The Franciscan fathers did much to de-velop adobe building along
graceful architectural lines. Nearly all of the missions which com
pleted a chain from San Diego to San Francisco were built of adobe,
and many of them are standing' yet. The mere expensive adobe man
. sions that have been built In the city thin the past year or two are
a revival of the mission style of architecture as adapted to dwellings.
It has aptly, been tern;-- . the Americanized moresque architecture,

The Doll of O-Tuki-San
1, HE Japanese children have a curious and touching belief that
their dolls, after a certain length of time, become possessed of
souls. They think that their liule paper or cloth playmate
knows them, can understand them, feels sorrow for their mis
fortunes and can also speak to them in dreams.
O-Tuki-San was a little girl in Tokio and she had a most l>eautiful
doll. It was ail dressed in shimmering colored silks, and had real
black hair stuck full of butterflies and dra-onfties. And this doll has
been with the family for over one hundred years. O-iuki-San would
â It and talk with it for hours, and the little smiling doll would smile
at her and teemed to nod its little black head as though it under
stood. But one day O-Tuki-San wandered off away from her little
boose into the great dark woods near by, carrying with her the doll.
That night there were parties searching all over for the litle srlr!.
but no one could find her and the searchers returned. But O-Tuki-
San's mother had been weeping so lons that she fell as.eep out of
sheer weariness. In her sleep she saw a little smiling doll come
through the door, all dressed in shimmering:, gayiy colored - *â ; It

A party immediately set out with her to the place of her dream.
They went along the road shown her by the doll untij^they^ came to

the sniffing little 101 l clasped tightly in her arms. You may be sure
there were no honors too great after that for the little doll. The

scheme would mean the accom
plishment of an engineering feat
such as the world has never seen
since its beginning. Even tha
building of the great Pyramids of
ancient Egypt would appear insignifi
cant beside this stupendous effort nZ
modern methods and science. The
value of a canal across the Amer
ican isthmus has been so fully
and continuously set forth by
the Presidents of the United States
and its commercial worth is so fully
realized by every citizen of Califor
nia that the point of its desirability
has long since been settledâ we need it
and must have it. According to Kar
wiese we ran have a canal system per
fected and in operation all in two years,
and for $48,000,000.
Admiral Walker at his recent ex
amination before the Senate made an
estimate of the cost of the Nicaragua
canal at $125,000,000.
The United States Commission of
1879 reported that the â¢ - ; t of the Pan

Nicaragua route.

that Karwiese had at last solved the
difficult problem -but is it feasible?

OF CALIFORNIA.
I consider the Karwiese
canal scheme "both visionary
as regards the route proposed
nnd fallacious from the stand
point of an engineer.
The dense undergrowth and
general character of the isth
mus are such as to render all
surveys more or less inaccu
rate, but hardly sufficient to
account for ttite marked differ
ence in distances rs laid down
by Karwiese raid the accredited
surveys over the same ground
mads by experienced Govern
ment engineers.
Making an approximate es
timate of distances, it is fif

Ocean to the head of San Mi
guel Bay, the Pacific harbor
of the proposed canal; from
the head of San Miguel Bay
to Chipigaua, a town at the
head of Darien harbor is twen
ty miles; from Chipigaua up
stream to the junction of the
Tuyra with the Chucunague,
twenty-seven miles; up the
Tuyra to the mouth of the
Aputi at tide water, ten miles.
This is the head of tide water,
and from here on to the head
waters of the Aputi and base
of the Cardilliere Mountains
a canal would undoubtedly be
required, twenty miles; then
a canal tunnel of seven miles
through the mountains; a
canal to be cut from the mouth
of the tunnel down the Tunela
to Port Cuti, or tide water,
twenty miles more. This
would give at least forty
seven miles of difficult canal
work, seven of which would
be a tunnel through an uncer
tain formation. From Port
Cuti on to the Atlantic would
be ten miles further.
Has the Key Unlocking the Intepoeeanie Doors Been Found? Can
an Immense Hanal Tunnel Become a Reality?
THE SAN FBANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JUNE 25, 1899.
FOUB full-rigged ships Bailing abreast through a gigantic tunnel nearly two miles long and mada bright
as day by innumerable lights would rival the wildest fancies of the Arabian Nights, and yet this is a
proposition a clear-headed, skillful civil engineer has announced not only as a possibility but as a faot
open to practical demonstration.
G. A. Xarweise, a German engineer of considerable repute and experienced in canal building, both on
the Suez canal and Isthmus of FanamÃ, has submitted a most remarkable plan to Admiral Walker of the Nic
aragua Canal Commission for connecting the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. He claims that in two years' time
and for $48,000,000 a ship tunnel canal can be completed through the Lower Isthmus of Panama between
the Gulf of Darien and the bed of the Santa Maria River in the Aputi Valley, which will be only eleven miles
long and have but a single lock at each terminus.
The CardiHiere Mountains cross the Aputi Valley diametrically and the marvelous feature of Mr. Kar
wiese's proposed route is the piercing of this monster stone blockade by a tunnel nearly 200 feet high.
This ship tunnel would be kept brilliantly lightec by electricity supplied from motors actuated by tlde
jaaachines built for the purpose from designs patented by William Bowman of Norfolk. N. Y.
canals have been laid out and accurate
ly surveyed at different times, from the
Nicaragua on the north to the Gulf of
Darien on the south, and they have all
n , turn I)een abandoned as impracti
cable except the Nlcaraguan. Even
the tunnel idea is lacking in ncn-elty, for
ye find in the report of Professor
Nourse, U. S. X., in regard to the San
Bias route, "that, although it would be
the shortest line of all the proposed
routes, the distance from the Atlantic
to the Pacific tide being only iLt.r, miles,
and although the harbors at b..th tor
mini are exceptionally good, it must be
eliminated from the problem of canal
ization by its demand for a tunnel of
from seven to eight miles."
Moreover, Commander T. O. Self
rldge, <_. S. N., made a most careful
survey In 1871 of the same mute now
proposed by Karwlese and filed with
the Government accurately compiled
maps of this who!., region, which
lengthen out the one and two-thirds
mile tunnel to seven long miles and ex
tend the eleven miles of canal to forty
seven; nor does the Selfrldge report
show that even with this forty-seven
miles of canal completed the passage
of deep-water ships down the river
â would be practicable.
The character of the country
throughout the isthmus is of such a
densely wooded description that surfa
veys are naturally difficult to mak^r
and more or less inaccurate, which fact
might suggest a possibility of Karweise
having made a remarkable discovery.
A lone white man with a party of na
tives might stumble upon a few iso
lated facts, but he is hardly to be relied
upon to discover sufficiently impor
tant data to sot aside the carefully
prepared surveys of America's
Government engineers under the
leadership of as able a man as Com
mander Selfridge.
In 1567 Professor Oeorge Davidson of
the University of California was sent f>
the Isthmus as representative of a cer
tain company to report upon a canal
system proposed by a man claiming to
have stood on a mountain and seen at
his feet on one side navigable waters
leading to the Pacific and on the other
a broad stream to the Atlantic. All of
â which was soon demonstrated to have
been a fraudulent scheme upon the part
of the discoverer, and the bubble burst.
In 1895 a German named Karwiese
came to the president of the Technical
Society of California and told a story
of tunnels and canals on the isthmusâ
how he had traveled alone with native
guides and had at last solved the ln
teroceanic canal question â all with the
Idea that he might lecture before the
society and thereby Interest capital.
He was denied the privilege. His the
ories seemed vague and his figures
lacking in foundation. Was he Kar
wiese of whom we now hear?
Has the Karwiese of the present day
really found the key?
B. O. LATHROP.
EX- PRESIDENT
HUGH CRAIG
OF THE CHAMBER OF
COMMERCE.
I think Mr. Karwiese > s ship
tunnel canal by no means an
improbable plan. As early as
the seventeenth century the
Scotch landing on the isthmus
of Darien formed the idea of
connecting thÂ« two oceans by
a 6iniilar canal, but of course
the primitive machinery of
those days would have ren
dered the effort futile. At the
present time, with modern ex
cavating and tunneling appli
ances, there is no reason in the
world why such a plan might
not be successfully carried
ou t â granting, of course, that
the geological formation of the
mountain be such as to render
the walls of the contemplated
tunnel self-sustaining. I have
never heard, however, of any
part of the isthmus where a
tunnel of one and two -thirds
miles would connect tidewater
with tide water. The shortest
ship tunnel canal route ac
cording to my recollection
would require a seven-mile
tunnel. Still, this is an age of
great discovery and progres
sion, and the long-sought-for
may have been found at last.
The Karwiese idea of room
for four ships to sail abreast
would be an unnecessary ex-
pense, and, besides, impractic
able. The tunnel could not be
made to stand. But a tun

commodate the largest battle
ship â say seventy-five feet â

patients, girls from the best families in town, who have laughingly

"Only yesterday a girl of about eighteen came into my

families in the city and are leaders in society. I wrote a prescription
for the mother and then chatted with them "for a few moments. The
daughter's eyes constantly wandered to a shelf at my right.
" 'What kind of perfume is that." she asked, pointing to a bottle.
" 'Let me put a drop on your handkerchief,' I said. 'It is ex

"She held out the handkerchief and she sniffed at the perfume
in the bottle with evident enjoyment.
" 'Did you ever try drinking perfume and water, doctor?' said
she. 'It tastes rather nice. Let's initiate him. mamma.'
"I wanted to find out the hold which the habit had on her. She
poured at least two tablespoonfuls each into the tiny glasses, and then
added water. Mother and daughter quaffed theirs with dainty eager
ness.
" "You like it, doctor? 1 asked the girl. 'Now, don't say no. or I'll
never play Hebe for you again. You don't want another? They're
not strong enough for the palate masculine I suppose. Come, mamma.
we'll have another just to show the bad doctor what he might drink
instead of horrid beer and wine.'
"I called upon the mother .that night. I insisted upon unlocking
the family skeleton. It is not an uncommon one. The story of a
man ho with the fever of gold dust in his veins and the fiery mescal
blunting his senses married a woman of the mining camp. She died
years afterward in a mansion on Van Ness avenue of delirium
tremens. /
Such were the grandparents of this devotee of perfume cock
tails. The curse had skipped her own father, but she is a daughter
of th( vine and unless something is done '.hese perfume decoctions
will be the beginning of the same terrible end with her.
"The mother laughed at my warning. 'All her girl friends drink
those harmless little things,' she protested. 'They nev*.r drink enough
to amount to anything. At worst it's but a silly fad, not a danger
ous one.'
"Not a dangerous one! It is the most insidious ally of the demon
of drink. Bui I could not convince the mother. I could not make
her see that this perfume habit was the first stumble toward the
chasms where those who fall seldom rise again.
"I had a long talk with the daughter. I helped her brush away
the cobwebs from her memory. The picture that rose frightened
her. It was her grandmother pinioned by strong arms, cursing and
shrieking! I told her of her own danger if she coaxed her probable
inheritance for liquor into being by drinking perfume.
"She thanked me for it and swore she would never touch it again.
She confessed that of late she had noticed that her fondness for per
fume was growing daily. She had never realized what it meant I
think the warning came Just in time.

The trained nurse was typical of the soft-spoken, Madonna-faced
ministering; angel. Her room at the Nurses' Training Home was
chaste in its sensible simplicity and sweet with the breath of potted
mignonette. Her cheeks flamed with the color. of the scarlet peony
when the subject of perfume drinking was mentioned. "
"Perfume drinking?" she stammered. "Whyâ why, how should T

"Dr. D'Evelyn said you might be able to give some information
on the subjectâ from observation of course."

"The physician for whom she usually nurses had warned her
against her inherited appetite. Moreover, he has always told his
patients that he never allows a nurse to drink intoxicating stimulants
while working under him.
"This had practically isolated her from danger. She was never
tempted by the "won't you have just a little something to brace you
up?' At th" same time the patients never realized that the anti-
Intoxicant ordinance was particularly necessary in this nurse's case.
"Sh- nursed for two years without falling from grace. Then the
physician noticed that she was acting peculiarly. Several months
passed before he began t<> have grave suspicions.
"When confronted \rith proof of gross neglect during her watch
she confessed that she had taken an overdose of perfume. She told
the story, concealing nothing.
"One nighc, while attending to a particularly trying patient, her
desire for something to drink overmastered her. On the bureau stood
a bottle of perfume. She recalled having heard that perfume would
satisfy alcoholic craving. She drank a quarter of the contents.
"From that time she took a nicrhtry potion of perfume when it
was accessible. Gradually she increased the amount, trying to delude
herself into the belief that perfume was not 'real' drink.
"She has been fighting the habit with all the wonderful will power
that sht can command. I am sure she will throttle it.
"She had always kept uppermost the danger that lay for her in
the liquor flask. But the perfume bottle, she weakly argued, was
such a harmless substitute. She knew that she was deceiving her
self, but not until others noticed it could she convince herself that
the same deadly evil lurked in the perfume.
"I have known other nurses to drink perfume when their nerves
cried for something. As a rule they do not repeat the experiment
frequently.
"After all perhaps there is more excuse for the nurse who snatches
D\MN the Yankees!" said the gray major, shaking his hand,
that was dripping with blood. He had Just ordered a retreat,
and the dust-colored column was retreating sullenly. The major
had fought at the front coming up. cheering his men on to the
charge but now, going back, he blushed not to be seen at the
rear He sat on his horse going down the valley with an expression
of bitter disappointment upon his face and hatred for his triumphant
adversary filling his breast. He glanced back up the gentle slope,
down which his men had charged a while ago and saw them toiling
up the hill again, bearing their dead and wounded and staining the
stones with their young blood.
The column of blue was steadily advancing. At the head rode the
blue general, who had turned the flank of the grays as a tin sword
turns when driven against a stone wall.
"Damn the Yankees!" was all the gray major could say, and then,
driving the spurs into the flanks of his horse, he galloped away after
his command At the top of the hill he halted his shattered band and
offered battle, for the hill was hard to climb and he hoped to punish
the blue general as he came on.
Seeing the great advantage they held, the gray column took new
courage and fought desperately. Steadily forward the blue general
led his men, drunk with the thought of a victory that was three
fourths gained. Many there were who went down that slope, but the
rest pushed on and up until the gray column began to waver.
The desperate but thoroughly beaten men looked appealingly to
the gray major, and at last, seeing the utter hopelessness of further
resistance, he ordered another retreat.
Now, as at the foot of the hill, the dauntless leader sat gazing
with mingled hatred and admiration at the stout figure at the head
of the blues. And as he looked a bullet came whirring up the hill
and pierced the breast of the gray major. He sank upon the neck
of his faithful horse and then rolled helplessly to the earth.
The blue general, having passed with his field glass to his face,
saw the brave major fall, but when he reached the summit of the
hill he observed that the officer had fallen a little to one side of the
road, his good horse remaining where the rider had gone down.
Summoning his own surgeon, the general bade him see what could
be done fox his fallen foe. The doctor dismounted and examined the
wounded man. He lifted the major's head. "Damn the Yankees!"
=aid the major. "Don't swear," said the doctor, and then the major
opened his eyes and gazed about. His glance rested upon the kindly
face of the blue general and he Immediately extended his hand. The

Perhaps there is more excuse â but unfortunately excuses don't
balance moral accounts.

"Perfume cocktails? Why, of course we drink them," said the
society girl. "Surely no one can object to them. It isn't as though
we drank them to excess. Just now and then, when the girls are
all together for a little 'heart-to-heart.'
"Some of the girls prefer their perfume in tea. I like it that
way myself. Just a few drops in the tea and you have no idea how
it improves it. Others mix two or even three kinds of perfume with
water, and still others mix water and perfume and gin and call it a
perfume fizz
"I think, on the whole, most of the girls prefer the perfume fizz
to any of the other drinks with perfume We use very little gin,
just a tiny suspicion of it. A perfume fizz is really not half bad.
We make them for the beys, and though they laugh at the idea I
notice they usually ask for more.
"Do some people really believe that perfume arouses a taste
for liquor? I had never thought of it from that point of view. We
used to drir.k it in school for fun and do it now from habit. It
has never created a desire for more with me. but perhaps it is
responsible for several of the girls dr . However, that's another
story.
"How silly! It's nonsense for me to think of such a thing. Of
course the perfume doesn't lead to other drinks. It's absurd!
"The girls who smoke cigarettes often dip the end in the per
fume bottle, draw the cologne up so that it permeates the tobacco
and then light them. They say you can both taste and smell the per
fume and that it's awfully good.
"I don't want to believe that the perfume habit is Â»o dangerous
or that it will create an appetite. These 'unto-the-third-and-fourth
generation' cranks always make my blood run cold.
blue general dismounted and gave his hand to the unfortunate major
and some words of commendation for his bravery. Then he gave the
major some very fine brandy, and the major, being of the South,
knew that it was fine, and was very grateful to the general for it
and for the attention of the blue surgeon.
"Good-by," said the general, mounting. "I must hurry on."
"Good-by, my gallant general. Good luck to youâ butâ damn the
Yankees!"
Just thirty years later the blue general was made commander of
the United States soldiers stationed at San Antonio, Texas. He had
grown gray in the service of his country, and the gentle woman who
had begun in her girlhood to be a soldier's wife had grown gray be
sjde him. Their children were men and women making places for
themselves in the world and presenting them with Interesting grand
children.
In a little while the hero of Grassy Hill and the charming woman
who had walked through a score and a half of years at his side, won
the hearts of the people of Texas, which had been of the South, but
were now of the great and glorious West, where there is neither North
or South.
Many men who had fought against the blue general had come to
know him personally and to respect him. If now and then they
brooded over the past they blessed the blue general and all his house.
One day while the general's grandchildren were driving in a pony
cart a horse drawing a delivery wagon got away from the driver and
went flying down the street.
The boys in the pony cart were turning slowly, their cart hang
ing crosswise of the street. They were talking and laughing, utterly
unconscious of the danger they were in. A man who wore a slouch
hat and had about him the air of an army officer saw the horse com
ing down the street and saw the danger the children were in.
Without a moment's hesitation he put himself in the middle of
the road, between the children and the runaway horse.
The horse seemed to be blind with fright, but as he neared the
man he swerved slightly, so that the wagon missed the cart, but
caught the man and rolled him over and over in the dusty road.
The general, who was walking in the avenue, saw it all and hur
ried to the man. '
"You are a very brave man," said he, "and I am unable to express
to you my appreciatlcn of what you have done."
"Oh, don't mention it, general," said the man. "I wÂ«Â«Â« deeply in
your debt for that excellent brandy you gave me on Grassy Hill."
Dr. F- W. D'Evelyn or> th>e
Perfume Habit Curse.
"Perfumes" as beverages present objectionable factors,
both from a physiological and psychological point of view.
"Perfumes" as most generally found are simply commercial
compounds, solutions of artificial aromatic oils, and bear no
more direct relationship to the "flowers" they presumably are
extracted from than a "Brummagem diamond" does to a Kim
berley brilliant.
The odor is essentially a chemical reactionâ not one of
enfleurageâ and is a combination of ethers and low alcoholsâ
which contain in their classifications some of the most potent
poisons and irritants â specific properties which they always
exert even when diluted to an excessive degree.
A few drops of the â¢'stock" from which these "perfumes"
are distilled would throw an ox into convulsions and give an
adult human an attack of chulera morbus â which would not
be associated with any "fragrant" memories.
The finer scents may be flower distillations, but in that
form cannot be used commercially â having to be fortified by
the addition of alcohol.
So a "perfume" in this c.ass would be essentially a diluted
alcoholic extractâ a soft, sensuous, seductive tipple, which
would lead by subtle stages to a condition of inebriation which
would ultimate in that condition more harshly styled a
"drunk." The victim of Esprit de Porarae would in time ex
hibit the same physiological degeneration as that of the vulgar
"sour-mash."
"Perfumes" must not be confounded with the scented
waters which since the days of Meda have formed a pleasant
addition to the bath or served to cloak the bitterness of the
housewife's physic.
The psychical objection to perfume drinking is that it
tends to form another excuse for social customs; boarding
house ante-dinner ennui entertainments, "where each' victim
draws her mite," ultimately intensifying that unmistakably
innate craving â for either sedation or stimulation. This is
interwoven with our tissue fibersâ the flaw in our make vp â
and to successfully combat it demands full recognition, abetted
by mental and physical resistance â not craven capitulation â
lest we succumb to this, our heirloom of degeneration.
DR. FREDERICK W. D'EVELYN.
"I've heard my mother tell that when Sibyl Sanderson was a girt
che was invited to a house party. The host did not believe in In
toxicating beverages. Sibyl drank up her own perfume and one night
after a particularly exciting game of billiards she shocked host and
guests by proposing that every one contribute their perfume to the
punch bowl as a "cologne cocktail was better than none.'
"Now, of course, that's going too far. But if when the girls are
alone they drink them just for fun there's no need of raising a hue
and cry. I'll make a perfume cocktail now. I have some 'peau
, d'espagne,' which is the very best cologne for a perfume cocktail."
"Sip it," commanded the cologne mixerologist.
Ugh! a biting, pricking sensation, that brought tears to the eyes;
a peculiar odor and taste that nauseated.
"I must have put in too much for the first time," said La Dame
aux Cologne. "I guess a perfume flin would be better. I'll tell you
somebody who makes them to perfection."
* â¢ â¢
The "somebody" who makes perfume flips to perfection proved
to be a gilt-haired club Johnny, who has an American name, speaks
English with a French accent and wears the official fez of the Sultan.
He modestly acknowledged being the inventor of the perfume flips.
"The girls like perfume," he said, "and occasionally thrust It on
us. They call water and cologne a perfume cocktail. Improve that
with gin and you have a perfume fizz.
"In a moment of inspiration I conceived of the perfume flip. It's
really nothing but a sherry flip with the addition of some peau
d'espagne. The girls have rather taken to it and last summer in San
Rafael I was duly commissioned Royal Perfume Flip-per.
"Between ourselves I think putting perfume in any drink Is
spoiling good material. But the girls all like it.
"Do you know lots of girls will take a drink that has a perfume
handle to its name when they refuse the same thing called by its
other title? The girl who will refuse a sherry flip has no compunc
tions about a perfume flip.
"Just like a worrftn, isn't it? For. come right down to it, the
perfume flip is worse. The addition of the cologne just adds more
alcohol."
â¢ â¢ â¢
And the pity of it all is, that it is just like a woman! And the
sin of it all is that we are doing nothing to stop the perfume habit.
For the sake of the daughters of the vine in our midst let us fly
a danger signal from every perfume bottle.

and trifles light as air, that have cost a
pretty penny, but Insist on getting soiled
at the very first opportunity.
Ribbons and filmy laces, chiffon bows
and mousseline ties, crepe de chine vests;
in fact, almost every frou-frou frill can,
after an introduction to the proper clean -
Ing process, be made to look just as goooX
us when they fluttered temptingly in the
shop window.
A woman and her money are soon part
ed at the neckwear counter. These soft,
cloud-like confections are so becoming,
and, of course, they are always displayed
in the kindest light. So madame pays her
$1 or J2O for them. She buys them in haste
and repents as soon For, not knowing a
bad thins when they see it, these neck
pieces prove susceptible to every bit of
dust that comes their way.
There was never a time when fluffy
neckwear was so popular as it is now.
There never was a time when it was more
fragile. in days gone by plain chiffons
. were used, and while tew knew how to
clear: these properly, the plain chiffon
was not considred as hopeless of reclama
tion as are the elaborate embroideries of
to-day.
Even these can be resurrected from
their soiled state into pristine freshness.
1 know you think I'm romancing and that
I'm going to tell you of a method that
base never been tried, but was invented in
a newspaper office.
i \ little French lady who makes her liv
â¢ft.; mending laces and cleaning fl.-.e Â«>*i
broideries took me into her secrets. So,
roll ip your sleeves and pay attention
while 1 initiate you.
First, then, make a lather of finest
â white castile soap and let it stand until
nearly cold. Then take out your soiled
chiffon or what not and soak it in the
lather. Do not under any provocation.
however soiled the material may be. rub
It. Pass it gently through the fingers,
shake it about for a few minutes until
thoroughly clean, then rinse in cold water
until it leaves the water quite clear.
Now dissolve a pinch of gum arabic in
half a cup of water, add a few drops of
â white vinegar nd dip in the muslin. Put
It afterward In a soft towel and pat it to
press the water out of it. Iron at once
on the wrong side only, with tissue paper
placed over it, using an iron that has
cooled down a good deal.
Remember when cleaning colored em
broideries or chiffons that you may re
store and brighten th.> colors by careful
washing, but color that has been de
stroyed by using too hot an iron can never
be regained by any known process.
In washing silk embroideries the water
must be very soft A few drops of am
monia will bring this desired result.
"When the colors are delicate add a few
drops of white vinegar or a pinch of salt
or both of these to the gum water.
I^arger pieces of embroidery should be
rlnned on a frame after the rinsing water
has been pressed out of them; all the
parts of the design should then be brushed
ovor on the wrong i : ide with a camel's
hair pencil dipped in a thin solution of
gum and vinegar. The frame should then
be put at once in a strong current of air
as it is Important that soft material be
dried as quickly as possible.
When material is nart cotton it is best
' cleaned in "bran water baths." Add one
quart of bran to three quarts of water
and let it boll for half an hour, then strain
and pour into two basins. Add cold water
to make one basin lukewarm and soak the
material in this, gently shaking it until
â¢ â¢lean. Rinse in cloar warm water and
give the article the stiffness that it had
when new by dipping it into the second
basin -of warmer bran water. Press out
tile moisture and dry quickly.
The Ironing process for all* kinds of em
broidery Is much alike. The table should
be covered with a thick soft flannel and
a very smooth sheet. When there Is
much shrinking pin :he article by its
edges to the ironing board; wrong side up
always. Iron quickly from the center out
ward to press the wrinkles toward the
edges, where they are most easily dis
posed of.
Follow these instructions and your chif
fons, laces and embroideries will take a
new lease of life.

THE plump girl having had her in
nings last week It is no more than
fair that the thin lady should
have consideration to-day.
I really believe it would take moro
than a Columbus to discover a woman who
was neither too fat nor too thin. She
may not be over weight or under weight,
according to strict rules of proportion, but
there is almost certain to be a wail about
a skinny neck or a Quadruple chin or a
too generous supply of hips or thin arms
or a pufflness of face that makes one
think of the pictures of Tommy Grace in
our dear old Mother Goose books. And
no sooner is one particular horror di.->
- than another pops up, like the
ramp at the back â .'â¢â . who comes di
rectly upon the heels of another for whom
the door of one's larder has swung wide
open.
However, there la no occasion to worry
about it so long as one does not assume
the extreme proportions of a museum fat
lady or a human skeleton.
Of course it would be too much to ex
pect that a woman should support either
one of those calamities with equanimity
or even philosophy.
A witty Frenchman has remarked that
"whatever can eat can be fattened." Of
course a great deal depends unon what is
eaton, and although some women seem
to be destined to amble through life with
the mengerneFS of Pharoah'a lean kine, I
still believe that by patience and perse
verance in the way of looking after one's
health, by taking the proper amount of
exercise and eating the right kinds of
food one may put off or take on flesh al
most at will. That is. of course, unless
there is some Internal trouble, such as a
tendency to dyspepsia or liver trouble, In
which case it will be more difficult to gain
flpsh than to get a sight of the Inhabitants
Â»of Mars through an ordinary field glass.
The first thing for the thin girl to do
in h^r effort to acquire avoirdupois is to
l^arn to breathe deeply. Upon rising In
the morning throw on a loose, warm wrap
xnf-r, opÂ»-n the windows, stand with your
Jhands on your hips a fid fill your lungs a
numbi r of" times with the fresh morning
air, rising lightly on the toes as you do
po. Tlun wali\ across the room several
times; taking long, full breaths from the
abdomen and keeping the chest well up
ftr:d out. This exercise if indulged in r.
ligio'jsly will, in the course of a year, add
a good two Inches to the breadth of your
chest and will fill out the hollows in the
neck. In a way quite wonderful to see.
After the exercise â  ike your sponge both,
rubbing briskly with a crash towel.
RemembÂ«r this. oh. ye willowy ladies,
if you wish to bo metamorphosed Into a
regular roly-poly you must swear an eter
nal let up on the "worrying habit. There
must be absolute freedom from care and
anxiety.
You must sleep at least ten hours out of
the twenty-four and snatch as many little
catnaps during the day a-* possible. Be
good and lazy. The plump girl must
hustle, but the thin girl may lounge to her
heart's content Be sure that your room
la well ventilated.
The diet should be liberal and should
consist largely of food containing starch
and sugar; potatoes, fresh sweet butter,
milk, cream, fruits cooked and served
with sugar: such vegetables nÂ« corn.
Bweet potatoes, beans and peas. Fish and
oysters, cereals, eggs, salads, good nour
ishing puddings, and game and poultry In
plfire of meat may be eaten. For tea and
coffee substitute chocolate and cocoa, and
let those be made rich and nourishing
and wo!! sweetened. Vinegar, pickles,
ac'ds and spiced foods are absolutely for
bidden
Dress leisurely and take everything in
llfp as quietly and happily as the un
avoidable worrying affairs will permit.
Exercise moderately but regularly.

VANITYâ There really Is no change
more difficult to bring about than that of
reducing the size of the hips. Electric
massage is, perhaps, the best way to
overcome the trouble. If you cannot get
the electric massage, then try the me
chanical, which should be followed by a
gentle rubbing down with alcohol. An
excellent exercise for this purpose is to
etand with the heels close together and
try to touch the floor with the tips of the
fingers, without bending the knees.
M. P. W. â If you will use the orange
flower skin food regularly each night for
a while, you will, i am certain, see the
greatest improvement in your skin. Here
is the formula:
Spermaceti, ore-half ounce.
Refined white wax. one-half ounce.
Sweet almond oil, two ounces.
Lanolin, one ounce.
Cocoanut oil, one ounce.
Simple tincture benzoin, ten drops.
Orange flower water, one ounce.
Melt the first live ingredients in a por
celain kettle. Take from the fire and add
the benzoin and the orange flower water,
beating It with an egg-beater until cold.
THERESAâ Blackheads will usually re
spond to a treatment of castile soup and
hot water supplied with a face scrubbing
brush. If, however, you have tried this
method and it has not proved efficacious
you might give the following soft soap a
trial: Take a half bar of pure castile
soap that is, about 5 cents' worthâ and
dissolve it In three cupfuls of boiling
water. When cold so that it is merely
blood warm add two saltspoonfuls of
borax and one tablespoonful each of
pure liquid ammonia and glycerine. Keep
in aglasa jar. Scrub the entire body with
this and rinse well. In washing the face
use the soft soap, and after a thorough
rinsing in tepid water apply a good cold
cream or the orange flower skin food,
formula for which is given in foregoing
reply to M. P. W. This lotion is good

V. G âI see no reason in the world why
buttermilk should cause hair to grow on
the face. I have never known it to have
that effect. Where there is an excessive
tendency toward superfluous hair, every
thing, even the action of the sunlight
or the least bit of friction, seems in some
cases to Irlcrease its growth.

glassful whenever you happen to think
of it. Nibble a bit of magnesia as you
would a bonbon, and eat food that is sim
ple and wholesome. Fresh dates, straw
berries and other laxative fruits you will
find particularly beneficial, and drink
milk to which a teaspoonful of lime
water has been added.
LIZZIE Q. T.â The very best rouge is
animation and good health. I disapprove
of other kinds, not because I think them

can put coloring stuff on her
cheeks without its being apparent

her artificial complexion. If rouge
is used at all, it should be used so spar

upon using rouge a very good one is rr ade

BESSIE Mâ Unless the fuzz on your

TAUGHT HER HOW TO PLAY POKER.
TEACH a woman how to play poker
and she'll break you," is one of the
few non-fallacious modern maxims.
That, at any rate, is what a young
married man who lives at Eck
lngton has been telling his friends
lately, and a couple of his class
mates and chums, who recently helped
him to initiate his wife into the joys
of American draw, are not disputing
the axiom. This pair of young men hap
pened to drop into the married man's
house separately not long ago, and as the
three men had talked over the whole
thing, domestic and foreign, on numerous
other occasions, the married man's de
lightful young wife thought that a game
of cards would be about right to fill in the
evening. The usual question, "What'll we
play?" was gone over and threshed, whist
being voted too hard work, casino too
pimple, euchre too stupid, etc.. until at
the end one of the married man's pals
said. "What's the- matter with draw?"
"Draw? What's that?" asked his
friend's wife
"Why, poker." he replied.
"Oh, surely, poker," she said. "I
didn't know you called it draw, though.
Why do you call it draw?"
I'sual explanation here.
"I've always been perfectly crazy to
learn how to play poker," she said then.'
"You're going to learn right now,"

She simply tossed her head airily.
"You needn't waste your sympathy on
me, any of you," she told them. "I know
just what I've got."
And those three great, strapping, hulk
ing men promptly proceeded to get scared
to death and laid down their hands to a
little woman who doesn't weigh more
than 120 pounds. She raked in the pot
with a thoughtful smile.
"Now. you don't have to show what you
had in your hand unless you're called by
somebody." said one of her husband' 3
pals, "but just out of curiosity, let's see
what you've got, will you, please,
ma'am?"
"I've got aâ what did you call it?â a full
house," she said, victoriously, and she
showed up three clubs and a pair of
spades. The three men looked at each
other in a disgusted kind of way.
"Nothing but a lal apoloosa," they said
to each other, "and a seven-high lal lapo
loosa at that, and she soaked the three of
us on it."
"Lal laâ what?" she inquired, looking
aggrieved. "Isn't that a full hand?" '
"Full nothing," said her husband. "It
isn't anythingâ a pair of deuces would
beat it."
Then they all three elaborately ex
plained again to her the values of the
hands and the game was resumed.
She dealt the hand herself. Her hus
band and her husband's friend stayed,
and she looked dubiously at her hand for
a long while, until all three of them be
gan to drum on the table.
"Don't hurry me," she said. "I want to
think."
She thought for some time longer, and
then she passed her hand over her fore
head despairingly and said:
"Well, if it only costs 5 cents, I guess I
can risk it."
She dished out the cards, and the three
men noticed that she only took one her
self.
"AVhat are you doingâ drawing to a
flush?" they all asked her.
"U-um," she replied.
Then the betting began again. When it
got up to her she raised it the limit again
They all dropped their cards and gazed at
her again.
"Did you catch the other card and fill
that flush?" they inquired of her in a
breath.
"I'm not going to tell you so there
now," she replied. "How could I bluff if
I told you?"
Then they all naturally concluded that
she hadn't filled her four flush, and they
watched for her to drop out when the
betting was up to her again. She didn't
drop. They had all three raised each
other the limit. She raiseu the three of
them the limit.
"My dear," said her husband to her
then, "you may know how to make tidies
and doylies and things, but as a pokerlst
you've got some shortcomings. Can't you
see that we all know now that you're
bluffingâ that you didn't fill your four
flushâ that you practically told us so? All
you've got to doâ and we'll all give you a
chance, won't we fellows?â is to just lay
down your hand and let us three fight it
out. Then you'll only lose what you've
got in the pot i.ow. See?"
"You play your own game," she said,
decisively. "I know what I've got."
Thus she alienated sympathy from her
self, and the three men went on betting.
She stood every raise and came back at
them each time. Her husband did the
first calling, and then they all laid down
their cards for a look. The young mar
ried woman spread out her four queens
and raked in the pot. They all looked at
her as if they thought there was some-

WOMEN AT HER BEST.
AT what age is woman at her best?
ISow, this is a matter of consider
able controversy, though the
woman herself will claim to be al
ways at her best. Writers and deep
thinkers have given the matter con
siderable attention, and the results of a
controversy between an author, an artist
and a society woman on that subject may
be of interest to the average man and
woman.
The author liked to study women be
tween the ages of thirty and forty. They
then had the experience of the world and
the joyousness of youth. In those years
they were brightest and most interesting
The artist disliked to paint the portraits
of women between the ages of twenty-five
and forty years. Before twenty-five the
face has an expectancy which charms. It
is looking forward with joyous freshness
and hope, and it is full of puzzling prom
ises. At forty the character is formed,
and the lines of the countenance are
stronger in the painter's study; but in in
tervening years the face has lost its ex
petancy, and is likely to be indifferent.
The society woman thought that it was
Impossible to give general answers to the
question, as individual women differ in
regard to the most attractive age. Some

At thirty or upward the best nature of a
woman will show to every advantage, but
probably the balance of opinion turns in
favor of from eighteen to twenty-five.

WHEN it was announced some
months ago that ilaire Bai
lor was to soon produce "A
Study of Danton." there was
a stir of expectancy among
the people who read books.
A great deal was expected, both from the
subject ami the writer And there has
been no disappointment now that we have
tho book befcre us. It Is entertaining and
profitable and holds the attention of the
render from beginning to en ..
Put how many have found the book
Just whm they expected In its method of
handling? We all knew that Belloc could
write a history of Danton. If any man
could, but who thought that the work
would be .i rehabilitation of one of Â»he
most important figures in the French
"Revolution ? And the rehabilitation ail
seems to be to the credit of Danton. 11
makes another man of the personage to
whom Tame over referred as "the
beast."
Of course. Mr. Belloc has picked out his
own point of view and looked at his sub
ject through different glasses than pther
historians, most of whom have been .-on
tent to work from the belief that the
man they were writing about was tne
"terrible Danton," and nothing else.
But Mr.' Belloc lias made a prof â  i â !
analysis that has led him to a firm con
viction, He really belives that Danton
was consistent, even though guilty of dh
the crimes of which he has been accused
an. , in fact, proven guilty.
The crimes are partially excused by Mr
Bc'.loc on the grounds of being necessary
to the welfare of the people in those trou
blous times. Thai Danton had a firm pur
pose in view all through the terrible
struggle Belloc has no doubt, much as he
is at variance with other historians.
One of the most important portions of
Belloc's work Is that which refers to the
youth of Danton. Very little is known,
but Belloc has all that there Is and :i
little more than his predecessors in the

PART "XII.
AARON smiled when the children told him how Mr. Bobs could set
a crow to catch a crow. He said the same plan had been practiced
for many long years. He had heard his father. Ben All, tell al
it. Indeed, the probability is that out of this practice the saying,
"Set a thief to catch a thief," had arisen, for nobody could trust a
thief to catch a thiet unless the first thief was securely fastened.
But Aaron, on his side, had something quite as interesting to tell the
children. From a negro whom he knew he had bought a raccoon, a gen
uine, full-grown raccoon. Thi* was news, indeed, and so exciting in Its
character that Aaron was compelled to answer, or to parry, volley after
volley of questions.
"Oh. how old is it, and what does it look like?" cried Sweetest Su-^an.
"And who is it to belong to. and is it tame, so tame that you can put
your hand on It?" asked Buster John.
"Why didn't dry kill it an' cook it?" inquired Drusilla.
Aaron put his lingers in his ears. He couldn't answer all the questions
put to him. Finally there was a lull in the excitement.
"What did you give for him?" Ruster John asked after a pause.
"Something." replied Aaron, smiling.
"Bii: how much?"
"Enough."
"Shucks," cried Buster John; "if I had known there was some great
secret about it I wouldn't have asked."
Aaron pinohed the boy's ears gently and said "Come!" He went to his
cabin, the children following, and when they went in the first thin? they
saw w;is Mr Coon pacing back and forth the length of the small Â»teel
chain whirh held him. He paused and regarded them curiously, twisting
the end of his sharp nose about and mechanically feeling in the cracks
of the floor with his forepaws, which seemed to be as supple and as useful
a>- .. boy's hands
When Buster John went nearer Mr. Coon raised himself on his hl'.i'l
legs and uttered B crj almost identical with the scream of a rooster when
a bird suddenly flies over, or a hawk appears in sight. Buster John knew
it was a warning and so he stopped.
"What Is the trouble. Frog-eaterâ Tadpole-catcher?" the Son of Hen
Ali sharply Inquii
"You can'l fool me," snarled Mr. Coon. "I've seen creatures like him
befor* Thej poked mv sides with sticks and pulled my tail."
"But this i neÂ» is different. Bug-eater." said Aaron.

as a result of being uvvsea by a bull when

thai when he '.>a.- sp akin,; in an anl*
muted manner h:s features 100k on a

"the demon."
but iti spite of this he was a man of
power, force and tact and gifted with
â (:â¢ M ilitj to make his remarks bell ived
by his listeners. Ho never spoke loudly,
i>ut in some waj he seemed to make hlm
self heard above all others, and those
who heard always remembered.
All of Damon's utterances were directed
toward th> salvation .. f France. His aim
and actions are held lo be consistent and
no sacrifice was deemed too great. â  i-. â¢ -
vidinj, the end was attained.
Mr. Belloi admits that In Danton's case
human life was h.-id very cheap, and thÂ»n
points nut all of the Â£r<'at men of the
d who held the power "f life or death
have acted ::i a similar manner. Thla he
holds to be due to the lack of a I
in either a Being <t a system. They lo'ik
upon their own code of morals as ail that
is necessary. Therefore such men are
recipe. But he put it off from day to day. and now there is nothing left
but the rough notes of these stories and some scattered fragments of ex
planation, one of which is presented above.
Well (to shoo all this away), Mr. Coon was highly delighted with his
dinner and was ready to curl up and take a nap, or was willing to join the
children in a frolic. So they led him into their playroom in the attic, r.n
snapped the chain from his' collar and gave him the freedom of the wide
space.
First. Mr. Coon must poke his nose or his forepaws into everything.
He paced round and round the room, smelling at or feeling in every nook
and cranny. When he was satisfied with his inspection nothing would Tin
but he must feel in -uster John's pocket. He pulled out marbles, nails,
fragments of china ware, which the youngster used in place of money.
With a few fragments of fine chinaware in his pocket Buster John always
felt rich. With this form of currency he hart bought whole droves of
ponies and large arsenals of guns, pistols, swords and war cannon .rom
imaginary venders.
Piece hy piece Mr. Coon brought Buster John's treasures to light and
examined them carefully. The children noticed that Mr. Coon's forepawa
were very much like tiny hands, and that his hind feet made tracks in the
sand that looked like those of a wee baby. Of course it was Sweetest
Susan who made this discovery. Whenever Mr. Coon left the prints of his
feet visible one could almost imagine that some small goblin in numan
shape had passed that way going on all fours. Almost! Why, Sweetest
Susan did imagine itâ was sure of it, indeedâ whenever she was in Make
Believe land, where she lived most of the time. Surely it could not be
more wonderful than the country next door to the world, where old Mr.
Ruhhit and Mrs. Meadows and the looking-glass children had their abode.
For a few days Mr. Coon feasted, and then the children thought he
should begin to pay for his board, first by giving an account of himself
and next in any other way that might be devised. So far as Mr. -non
was concerned, he was perfectly willing to accommodate the children. He
was never bad tempered unless he saw a cat or dog. and such of these as
were about the house and yard soon learned to give him a wide berth, for
his claws and teeth were sharp and he was a born fighter.
In Joe Maxwell's rough notes Mr. Coon began thus:
"If I had to tell my tale from the talk-think, as you talk your talk, I'd
talk no talk of this thing." As this would he hard to follow, it has been
rendered into a free translation from first to last.
" f T had to learn my language out of books, as you -do yours."' said
Mr. Coon, leaning back in a corner of the playroom and rubbing his face
and nose with both hands. "I wouldn't have much to say about myself, for
1 wouldn't know how to say It. My home was in the hollow limb of a tree,
and I can remember how nice it was to sleep in that soft, warm place.
There were four others besides me. and we used to sleep close together
till our mammy came home. We were always awake when she came, for
we could hear her climbing the-tree, and then, if it was not raining, she'd
pit on the outside and dry her feet and clothes with her tongue. Some
times we'd get impatient and begin to cry. and once one of the others wept
to the door: the slap he got made him squeal, and none of us ever moth
ered our mammy any more by going to the door. But. mv' How hungry
and angry I used to get while mammy pat out there cleaning her feet find
drying her clothes. But she always to.ok her own time, and then when she
came in what a scramble there was for the right teat. Mine was the mid
dle onÂ». but I always had to claw and be clawed before 1 could get It. We
were all ravenous, and T never did get as much food as I wanted at one
timÂ» till I came here. 1 think our kind are born hungry and kept hungry
that we may be able to escape from those that follow us.
"The first thing I really remember was once when I heard a bird chirp
ing and whistling right at our very door. T trembled and shook all over
The others were asleep nr<l T was glad of It. Shaking and Iremhllng I erenl
to the door, and there, right nt me. was n bird with a long bill, which he
was poking under the bark. Shivering and shaking T lumped on him but
T came near falling to the ground. He was stronger than he seemed to
be. and he had clnws. too. He clinched me with these and beat me over
the head with his wing?, but T didn't mind that. I didn't mind anything T
shook no longer. I felt mv hair rising on mv back: I heard myself <jrowl
1 didn't know why. but I was furious. I crushed the bird in mv teeth"
until his wings cased to move: but I was still angry: I had tasted blood:
I had made mv first kill. If one of the others had come out just then 1
think he would hnvc been sorry. But they wpro all frightened by the noise
and were huddled In the farthest corner. Then when T was' no longer
angry, but proud. T went to the door carving the bird in mv teeth. They
smei'ed the blood and rushed at me. and then there was a fight!"
"Why. yon were fighting your own brothers nnd sisters!" said Sweetest
Susan severely.
"So would you If you were of mv kind " replied Mr. Coon. "There was
a fight, but they all got a piece of the bird. After that we were changed.

often what Is called "unscrupulous."
This Danton was where the carrying out
of his own ideas was concerned.
That portion of Panton's career t>>
which Mr. Belloc devotes himself is In
reanty less than five years. In all this
time Panton was filled with tile revolu
tionary idea and seemed to think that
France was in danger from the allied
monarch? of the r^st of the world through
the indifference of her own governing
classes rather than an internal danger
as a result of abuses of th^ peasants by
the nobility. Panton loved France and
hatfd anybody who menaced her by word
or deed." "It is only in the saving of
France." Belloc remarks, "when the men
of action are needed thai he leaps to the
front. Then suddenly the whole nation
and its story becomes filled with his
name. For thirteen months, from that
10th of August, 1792. which he made, to
the early autumn of the following year.
Panton. his spirit, his energy, his practi
cal grasp of Things as they were, formed
the strength of France. While the the
orists, from whom he <Â«r> profoundly dif
fered, were wasting themselves in a kind
of political Introspection, he raised the
armies. When the orators could only
find great phrases to lead the rage
against Dumouriez's treason, he formed
the committee to be a dictator to a fall
ing nation. All that was useful in the
Terror was his work; and if we trace to
the very root the actions that swept the
field and left it ready for rapid organiza
tion and defense, then a: the roots we
nearly always ;ind his masterful and sure
guidance.
Months In the revolution count as years
On M;irch in, 1793. th* 'evolutionary tribu
nal was formed, and on April 6 following
the committee of iubllc safety. Danton
worked for these ne<vuse he said -hat
France had no head. She had no central
power, without v.hlcn it was impossible
to secure prompt .in-i pffective action
The awful .-vents cf the following fifteen
months, when a large portion <>f the popu
lation ran riot, are mi.rl carefully stu .Mod
and graphically 'le-picted. Of <ht
butcheries of this period Mr. Belloc holds
that Panton is entliely innocent He
shows that while the eruli.otine was work
ing almost day and ni^lit Panton never by
word nor deed gave encouragement to the
horrors.
All of which is very well, but Mr. Rel'.oc
does not show that Panton tried in Âny
way to put a stop t.i them. There is no |
doubt but that it was in the power of
Panton to stop thr- k ; i!ine but the fact
remains that h^ did ;...(. "This act is de
fended by Belloc with the statement thai
Panton was indiffprf.it to the fate of the
people and di.i not ;are what happened so I
long as his plans were carried out. Which :
of course all goes â  â â > uphold Mr. Belloc' s
idea of Danton's consistency.
Of the end of Panton Mr. Belloc's story
is most dramatic }\r niakes the eve.it n
tragedy thai is to h-ive an effe< t on ihe
world equal to the *=nd of a martyr. The
scene on thn scaffold is certainly a power
ful one. Mr. Belloc -(marks: "H^ si lod
thus a moment conspicuous over the
people whom he hq 1 â¢â¢<> often swayed. In
that attitude he remains for history. '
Whether Mr Belloc will succeed in
chancing the opinions we have forme I of
Panton from ;)ip history of the past i
years remains to ho .â = <>n. His arguments
are certainly strong, . ut have any num
ber of weak points In the vital places
According to Mr. Belloc. Danton is a af
ferent man from r, certain standpoint than
we have been accustomed to consider h'm,
and it is p;tsy to admit that Mr. Belloc is
right. There is no doubt thru the class

story of I'tah, said to be based upon fn^t. :
Mormonism Is shown tin in an uncomnli- I
It seemed as if we had been asleep all the time and something had sud :
dent? awakened us. Then mammy came home. She sniffed around aim
smelled the blood and saw the feathers. She nosed under us as we lay
and rooted us out of the way. but she found nothln' more than feathers.
'Well, I declare!' she cried; : \vho's been bringing you a bird?'
" 'Is that what you rail a bird?" asked one of the others, and when she
said it was they all squalled out: 'Oh, mammy, mammy! Fetch us some
more! Mammy, fetch us some more!'
"Rut she kept on asking: 'Who brought this one? Who brought this
one?' I said nothing, but the others looker! at me and said I was the one
that brought the bird.
" 'Where did you get it?' mammy asked.
"I told her I had grabbed the bird, and though she said nothing she
seemed to be pleased, and I noticed that she combed my hair with her
tongue a great deal longer than she ever did before. After that she began
to bring us birds and frogs, and once she brought us a big fish, and that
was fine."
"Frogs!" cried Drusilla. "You hear dat? Frogs!"
"Not the kind that live on land." explained Mr. Coon, making a wry
face, "but the kind that hide on the bank of the creek and jump in when
they hear you coming. You have to take many long and hard lessons be
fore you can catch one. Fish are easier to catch. You turn your back to
the .-reek, let the tip of your tail touch the top of the water and move It
about- and wait."
"Huh! I see myself!" exclaimed Prnsilla resentfully.
"Hush up," said Buster John: "he's talking about coons."
"Well, some folks call niggers coons." replied Drusilla.
"All this time," Mr. Coon continued, paying no attention to the inter
ruption, "you leave your body turned half around so you can see what is
going on in the water. When the fish shows himself you reach down ana
flirt him out on the bank, and in reaching you have to be quicker than the
Psh â fish arc mighty nuick. But a gnawing stomach (dag ig lublum;
literally, crying-for-meat-thing) makes a quick hand.
"Well, mammy was trying to teach us all these things, and we -vere
learning very fast. She took us with her when the sun was low, or when
it had just gone away. and. though the light was trying to our eyes. Wfl
did very well. Once mammy heard a dog barking, and she hurried us
home, making us run as hard as we could. I asked her what the trouble
was. and she said it was the barking of the dog that scared her. and she
told us that when we were older and heard a dog bark we must hurry
home by a roundabout way. and run in the water whenever we could, be
cause dogs had a way of smelling where we went along and following us
wherever we went; and If they followed us home they'd sit at the foot of
the tree and bark until a man' would come with a sharp cut-thing and hit
fhe tree until it fell.
"All these things we learned, and a great many more, but you know
tvhat fool things young things are."
"T ain't ol". but T know T nin't no fool." interrupted Drusilla.
"Oh. will veil hush?" cried Buster John.
"You know what fool things young things are." repeated Mr. Coon.
"They listen to what thoir elders say and think it is nothing but talk. The
young thing is always a smarter thing than the old thing, and sometimes
he is too smart. I remember that one night I slipped away from the others
after mammy had been gone a long time. T was careful to make no noise
on the tree, but when I reached the ground I felt so happy that 1 jumped
in the air and whirled around for joy. The air was cool and fresh, the
swamp smelled good and the dark was fine. T could see everything ever so
much better than when the big shine-thing is blazing over the trees.
"So T shook myself and started for the pond in the swamp. There I
caught some small fish, and they tasted ever so much better than those
mammy brought home. Then I wandered out of the swamp and went on
the hill where the brambles are. hunting for birds and birds' nests. T
found two birds find one nest with tiny eggs in It. and the eggs tasted so
nice that I wanted more, and T went rambling all over the hill ever so far.
Suddenly T heard a dog bark. The sound of it made me shake and shiver,
and I stood listening. Presently I heard the bark again, and it was so
close at hand that It sounded like a dreadful roaring."
"T boun' you had ter hump yo'se'f den." suggested Orusilla.
Mr. Coon* with his eyes half shut, for he was sleepy, kept right on the
track of his narrative.
"A drendful roarimr. T went away from there as fast as mv lees .'onld
carry me. Â«nd ran right to the swamp. I could hear the dog coming, ".on;
and far off T could hear some one crying out."
"That was the man cheering the dog." Buster John explained.
"The dog," said Mr. Coon, "seemed to be coming closer and closer, and
I began to run harder than ever. I remembered that mv mammy had said
something about water and dogs, and T ran straight for the big pond in

THE KINSHIP OF SOULS A narra
FREAKISH EPITAPHS IN OLD CEMETERIES.
HAVE you ever devoted a melan
choly hour to the pleasing task
of thinking; out an appropriate
epitaph for yourself? If you
possess a scarcity of ideas on
the subject, wander some day
through the cemeteries of San Francisco
In the older portions of some of these you
will find a number <>f epitaphs that are
both quaint and curious.
The writing of epitaphs, like that of
epigrams, is said to he a lost art. How
ever that may be, the supervision which
is now exercised over the Inscriptions on
tombstones has caused a great change
between the graveyard literature of to-,
day and that of a hundred years ago.
There is one thing to remember when
reading epitaphs, particularly thdse of a
eulogistic character. It is that "the writ
er of an epitaph is not upon oath." Ig
natius Donnelly once, when expounding
his Baconian theory, was asked -why, if
Shakespeare could nat write, his family
had a monument placed over his tomb
representing: him with a pen in his hand.
For one brief second Mr. Donnelly hes
itated. Then, his Irish wit coming to the
rescue, he replied:
"Oh, my friend, if you are going to take
testimony from tombstones, you offer evi
dence that no properly constituted court
would accept."
There is a world of freakishness reveal
ed In the epitaph! in some of the local
cemeteries, particularly as regards com
position and grammar and the distribu
tion of punctuation marks and capitals.
Suppose you begin your wanderings in
the Masonic Cemetery, in the southeast
corner of which you will find an epitaph
that is most Interesting, as containing the
story of a long and eventful life. It is
engraved upon the two sides of a pyra
midal monument, and was composed by
the man himself some years before his
death. It reads:
"All you that chance
This grave to see
If you can read English
May learn by meâ
I traveled, read and studied
Mankind to know
And what most interested them
Here below.
The present or the future state and love
of power,
Envy, fear, love or hate occupied each
wakeful hour.
All would teach, but few would under
standâ
The greater part know little of either God
or man.
Love one another, a very good maxim all
agreed.
Learn, labor and wait if you would sue

the swamp; the Son of Ben Ali knows where it is. I slipped into the water
and swam to the middle, where there's a stump of an old tree. I had
hardly reached it when the dog came in sight on the bank of the pond and
began to whine and bark. He ran around to see if I had gone out on the
opposite side, and then he caught sight of me. He jumped into the water
with a great splash, and when I saw him. coming fear seemed to leave me
I climbed upon the stump, and when he came near I jumped on his head
and bit him on the neck with all my might. He went under, but I turned
him loose and came to the top and swam around and round. He came up
trying to shake the water from his ears, and they flapped on the pond
like the wings of a duck that is trying to rise in a hurry. Before he cot
through flapping I had jumped on his bead again, and when he went down
I clawed him with my hind feet. He tried to cry out, but all he could do
was to make bubbles on the water. I jumped on his head twice after this
and the third time he never came up any more. I went out on the bank'
shook the water off my clothes and cantered toward home. As I went
along, feeling very proud, I heard the man calling his dog. First he blew
a horn. He blew it a long time, and then called and called; but the dog
being at the bottom of the mill pond, could make no answer. *
"When I reached home I found mammy there. She had heard the doe
bark and had made haste to get out of the way. Then, finding one of her
children missing, she knew that something had happened or was going to
happen. She was sure of it. She heard the dog running, and she knew
the missing young one would be caught. If he wasn't caught she hoped
he would be badly. scared; it would serve him right for not obeying the
rules she had made.
"When I got home you may know I was tired. Mammy dried mv clothes
while I told her what had happened, and she would hardly believe it- but
she could plainly hear the man calling his dog, first with his voice and then
with his horn. He kept that up for some time, and finally on his way home
he passed right under our house, calling his dog and tooting his hornâ and
I was the only one of the family that dared to look out as he went by
"Well. I had no more adventures until one night, having come home
myself. I heard a crowd of dogs barking. The noise they made grew
louder and louder, and presently I heard mammy climbing the tree as hard
as she could. She came up so fast that I could hear pieces of bark fall
to the ground. She was scared nearly to death.
" 'They are after me, she cried, 'and I didn't have time to take to
water!'. Sure enough, the dogs came charging through the bushes howling
and panting like mad, and they gathered around the tree and howled and
harked until the men came up with torches. I was curious to see what was
going on. though the others were too frightened to move. I came out and
sat on the limb and looked down at them. They were all black men ex

moved it back and forth behind him.
" ' T t hP v^ f Js.' he yelled. 'I see his eyes!' The man with a cut-thin"
began to hit the tree. I never knew what was going to happen until the
tree began to sway. Then I could feel it falling. As it fell Iran down th*

Churchill ended his life in this city. In a
letter to the Coroner he gave his r^a-,^
sons for taking the fatal step. He said: T
"It takes money to live and it requires
work to get money, and I am unable to
work, too Droud to beg and not smart
enough to steal. I am absolutely com
pelled by the unfortunate circumstances
in which I am placed to end a life whifh i
has become a burden to me." J
Attached to the letter was the epitaph
which he wished placed upon his tomb

"Here unfortunate Churchill lies,
Nobody laughs, nobody cries;
Where he's gone, how he fares,
Nobody knows, nobody cares."

Not to be outdone in Irishness, the
Southwell singers at the Grand will put
I on "The Lily of Killarney." As a special
Inducement it is pledged us that Mr.
Persse, who has the principal role of
Myles Nm (,'oppaleen, is just as Irish as
his stellar colleague of the Tivoli. The
two productions will offer an interest
ing study in the operatic modes of yes
terday and to-day. "The Lily" is a bal
lad opera of the old type. "Shamus"
is urgently dramatic in treatment,
written in the graphic idiom of "Bo
heme," or even Wagner, one might
say. Again, like Mr. O'Sullivan, Mr.
Persse will interpolate several stirring
Irish songs. Edith Mason will have a
comely chance as Eily O'Connor, and
Mr. "Wolff ought to add another strik

Many advantageous alterations are

ami action. It is a matter of fact that
Mr. Morrison has enjoyed considerable
success In the piece since it was pro
duced here last year. An early attrac
tion of the Morrison engagement will
be the first performance on any stage
of Charles Ulrich's "Robespierre." Mr.
Ulrich is a local newspaper man who
has turned stageward before. From all
accounts his "Robespierre," although
as yet unplayed, antedates the Bar
dou piece by the snme name that is
now being played by Henry Irving.

original creation of the Deacon in "A
Midnight Bell."
â¢ * â¢
Mentioning "The Turtle" â which
piece, by the way, is touring the
State to a vigorous accompaniment of
abuse and slim patronage â some of the
metropolitan newspapers were quite
excited over our swift treatment of it.
In an editorial by the inquiring title of
"The Herring or tb>' Nose?" the New
York World says:
San Francisco has Juat had a first view
of a play which filled a New Tork play
house every nicht and at two matinee
performances a week for many months.
The Pacific Blope critics ran from the per
formance with their lingers to t h.-ir noses
and ransacked Crabb and Roget for syn
onyms for the word "disgusting." The
owners of the house in which the play
was produced have sued the producers,
and say that they fear they will never
he able t" disinfect their theater.
Ran Francisco has the reputation of he
ing an extremely easy going, "broad
minded" town. What is the matter?
Is San Francisco indulging In a spasm
of prudery? Or Is our moral sense of
smell so clogged by the high perfumes
which our theatrical managers have held
under ovir moral nose that we can no
longer detect the presence of a theatrical
dead herring?

At present San Francisco is favored

GRACIE PLAIBTED.
Why did I go on the stage? Because it
was necessary for me io do something I
was educated at Mills College, and had
for my vocal teacher Alfred Kelleher of
this city. He always said I had a good
voice, and after my father failed in busi
ness suggested the sage as a means of
supporting myself. 1 made my first ap
pearance with the old California stock
company in a fantastical play called A
Trip to the Moon." playing the part of
the girl to Alice Harrison's Prince Cap
rice. I married soon after that, and gave
up the profession. When my little girl
was a year old my husband's failing
health made it necessary for me to again
go on the stage, and it was not until then
that I fully made up my mind to adopt
the stage. It was then that I appeared
With Emilie Melville.
EDWIN STEVENS.
Like a great many ether people. I turn
ed to the stage when everything else
seemed to have failed. I was at one time
superintendent of a mine in Arizona, but
the Indians drove us out of the country,
and I earrre to the c : ty without a cent.
I was supposed to possess a good voice,
and so some of my friends secured me a
position with the Alia> Oates Opera Ccm
pany at a salary per month nardly <â¢ iual
to my former one per week. Howevei, 1
stuck to it. and after a year of hard iu<-k
struck paying gravel.
WILLIAM WOLF.
Mr. Wolf made his first public appear
ance in th.- Identical part which he Is now
playingâ that of Gaspard, the miser, in
"The Chimes of Noimandy." "First of,
all " said Mr. Wolf. "1 was a church sing
er and appeared In â  !>era with an amati ur
company that was -r:-.:nu a uenefit for the
church. The manager of the company
gave me a recommendation to the Holmes
Opera Company, and : made my debut
with them as Alexis in 'Sonr.ambula.' I .
had no Intention of making the stage a
profession It was In a way forced upon
me Mj opportunities were so good that
!t would have been folly to refuse them.
Sime that time I have appeared in one;
hundred and twenty operas. The first
comedy part 1 ever p!ayed was that of:
Dick Deadeye."
E3DWARD MORGAN.
Mr Morgan Is an exception t<> the gen
eral rule. He didn't fall In love with the
stage I!'- took it lip because he failed
in so many other things. Said he: "I
decided to go on the stage after falling,
or thinking I had failed, in so many other
things. Mv lirst part was with Mr. Fron- !
man s original Shenondoah company some
nine years ago. Mr. Miller played the |
leading part. I was the man who brought
the horse on and my own line went some
thing like this. 'I was instructed to show j
them through the lines.' and I was cheeky
enough to ask Mr. Miller what he thought
of my performance. We often laugh over
It now." It is a long: step from the "man
Who brought on the horse" to the crea- ;
tor of the part of John Storms in "The
Christian."
FRED NIBLO.
How did I come to go on the stage?
WpII. ever since I can remember 1 have
wanted to act. You see it happened In i
this wise. 1 was for a long time an ex
pert accuntant with the New York Life
insurance Company. I belonged to sev
eral large dubs in that city, among others
the Century Wheelmen. One evening;
they gave a Stag smoker and engaged a j
very prominent minstrel to entertain the i
members. Fur some reason be did not !
arrive, and the boys begged me to blacken j
up and take the place, which I did. I
suppose T must have made a success, for '
I was besieged by all the clubs in town-
I gave up my position and became what i
is known as a society entertainer. From
that I drifted into the vaudeville.
DENNIS O'ST'LLIYAN.
Originally 1 had no Intention of adopting
the stage. After my father's estate was
settled I went to Europe to study. When
1 had worked for a while I began to ap
pear at "at homes" and concerts. On one

fore I went on the stage, and 1 intend
keeping my promise.
HENRY MTLLKR.
Ip to the time 1 was lv I had only been
in a theater twice. Then 1 read a maga
zine article giving a sketch of Henry
livings life. That settled it. I deter
mined to become an actor, modeling my
carrer un the lines laid down by Mr. Irv
ing. My first appearance was at the
Grand Opera-house, Toronto, Canada. The
part was that of the Karl of Shrewsbury
in "Amy Robsart" and the number of my
lines one. 1 am told that I read it very
Intelligently, it is rather a coincidence
that Mr. walcott, who is now in my <-oni
pany, should have been the leading man
then.
FLORENCE ROBERTS.
I went on the stage first, because it was
necessary to do something, and. second.
nedause I had been told that I would be
a success. The (jueerest part of it all is
that I thought I'd make a good soubrette.
Imagine! My first speaking part was iliat
of Poach Blossom in "Under the Gas
light." Before that I had been on as an
extra eirl in "Arrah-na-PoÃue." Then I
joined Mr. Morrison's company and havu
been with him almost constantly since.
LEWIS MORRISON'.
I went on the stage because 1 was
young, fond of excitement and had noth"
ing else to do. I was an officer in the
Federal service during the civil war. At
the close of the war I drifted into New
Orleans, and one night at the theater fell
in love with the art und determined to try
the stage. Lawrence Barrett was then the
manager of the theater, and laughed nt
me when 1 told him of my determination.
He finally gave me a partâ that of Cap
tain Amersfort in a farce. "The Loan of
a Lover." In six weeks' time I was play
ing Rarradns in "Richelieu"â rather an
ambitious part for a novice.
MARGARET ANGLIN.
There is little about me that :s in
teresting. I simply drifted into the pro
fusion. My intent was to give readings,
and I studied for that purpose at the
Wheatcroff School of Acting in New York.
Mr. Wheatcroff persuaded me to try the
stage, and so T accepted a place In Charles
Frohman's "Shenandoah" company In the
fall of '94 T liked it so well that I'decided
to make th*Â» stage my life work.

at one time an actor and a very clever
one, too. Wtien asked how he happ'-mrd
to adopt thf- stage he said: "If I remem
ber correctly I fell into itâ literally, I
mean. You may not believe it, but nt one
time I was known a? the "boy tenor."
The night I made my first appearance
I tripped on a nail and landed full length
on the stage. To say I made a hit would
be to put it mildly. Since then I have
done everything then- is to be done on
the stage, with the exception of the -ole
of female impersonator.
QI'ERITA VINCENT.
With me the stage was a matter of
choice. Even as a young: girl I was never
ambitious to be some man's housekeeper
for my board and clothesâ for too often
that's about the reward of the dutiful
Wife. I looked forward to the time when
I could be self-sustaining and self-inde
pendent. I thought seriously of law ana
medicine, and was about to choose be
tween them when my attention was
drawn to the stage. I decided that the
p-me amount of hard study required in
obtaining a diploma in either law or
medicine, if devoted to some branch of
the stage, would bring greater returns,
and it also offered the advantage of be
ing at least partly self-supporting from
the start, which the study of medicine or
law does not. As I had a natural talent
for dancing I took up that line first, and
even to-day I devote hours and hours to
study and practice. I am now more than
satisfied that my first ambition to become
a lawyer or a doctor did not material
ize. Cold, practical consideration
prompted me to seek the stage,
and 1 find that it is a profession where a
woman, if she chooses, can, under the
most trying circumstances, maintain her
self-respect. The honors that come with
stage life I care little for, but respect I
prize above all things.
THOMAS H. PERSSE.
I am an Irishman, horn near Limerick.
My family moved over to Toronto, Can
ada and at the time of the Reil rebellion
of 'S3 1 was traveling for the Canadian
Pacific Railway. I at once left my posi
tion and enlisted as a private. When the
trouble was over I had just received my
lieutenant's commission and a medal.
However, I couldn't live on medals, and
so having a good voice, I resolved to
study for the stage. I was studying with.
F. E. Bristol In New York City when
Louise Kellogg, who was seeking a tenor,
heard me. She engaged me and I made
my first operatic appearance as Manrico
in" "Trovatore," a part, by the way, that
is still my favorite role.
EDITH MASON.
My dream had always been to be a
groat concert singer, and I studied with
that intent. For a few years I was soloist
with Gilmore's band and later with Seidel.
Julius Grau. a cousin of Maurice Grau,
managed a comic opera company at this
time and heard me sing. He offered to
make me his prima donna, but I said, "I
can't act." "Oh, that's all right." said
he; "we'll teach you." I accepted and
made my first appearance with them as
Serena in "Said Pasha."
THE OUTER WORLD.
Colonel Robert G. InKersoll's address at
the actors' fund benefit in New York re
cently has attracted attention in dra
matic circles. The gifted colonel in hfs
enthusiasm soared to dizzy heights. It
would seem, judged by his answers to ths
question, "Who Are the Friends of the
Human Race," which formed the opening
for the following response:
"The citizens of the mimic world, who
have d^lightod the weary travelers on
the thorny path, amused the passengers
on. the fatod train, and filled with joy
the hearts of the clingers on spars, of the
floaters on rafts. 'With fancy's wand
they rebuild the past. The der.d are
brought to life and made to act again the
parts they played. The hearts and lips
that long ago were dust are made to
beat and speak again. The dead Kings
are crowned once more, and from tfie
shadows of the past eirurge the Queens,
jeweled and sceptered as of yore. Lov
ers' leave the graves and breathe again
their burning vows: a; d again tha
white breasts rise and fall in
passion's storm. The laughter that
di.,l away beneath the touch of
death is h.ard again, and lips that fell to
ashes long ago are curved once more with
mirth Again the hero bares his breast
to death; again the patriot falls, and
again the scaffold, stained with noble
blood becomes a shrine. When In the
mimic world the shaft of wit flies like
the arrow of Ulysses through all the
rings and strikes the centerâ when words
of wisdom mingle with the clown"s con
ceitsâwhen folly laughing shows her
pearls and mirth holds carnivalâ when
the villain fails and the right triumphs â
the trials and the grids of life for the
moment fade away. The stage brings
solace to the wounded, peace to the
trendedâ and with the wizard's wand
touches the tears of grief and ..hey are
changed to tears of joy."

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, June 21â bear operators !
anmng the professional traders became some- j
â what discouraged over the events of to-day's
short session and engaged in something like a I
scramble to rover outstanding short contracts '
in the closing dealings. The bank statement, 'â¢
â while It cannot be called a favorable one, was '
not as weak as had been foretold, and when
the bears started to cover shorts after its pub
lication found that It bad brought slight offer
ings to Bell. Prices were marked up quite
suddenly in some cases to the highest point
' of the day, making the closing quite buoyant in
tone. The further liberal expansion of more
than $5,000,000 in loans indicated the faith of
banking authorities in the money outlook. Who
are the borrowers of this large amount of
money is as much a mystery us was the in
crease last week. It has certainly not gone
into the stork market during the week. One
supposition is that the gold that has been go
ing abroad goes in the form of actual loans to
foreign institutions. This would help to ex
plain the mysterious action or the exchange
inr.rket in face of the g^U shipments, which has
taiivd to reflect any yielding under offerings
of bills against the shipments. The strength
in to-day's stock market centered in the Van- ]
derbilt group, New York Central, Northwestern i
and St. Paul and Omaha rising from 2-. to 4
points. The arrival in this country of Cor
nelius Vanderbilt and the strong statement of
New York Central for the llscai year were the
presumptive grounds for the strength in this
group. The grangers, th? Trunk lines and the
railroad list generally -were strong throughout.
There was weak] at one time In Steel and
Win Sugar and Tennessee Coal. Steel and :
Wire did not rally strong, but other stocks
were, practically without exception, higher at
the close and at notable net Rains.
.The bond market was quiet and yielded at
BOtne p"ints. The bears have been energetic
and aggressive during the week and have had
â¢ moderate success In driving prices to a lower
level: But their success has been almost en
tirely confined to the individual stocks, which
they singled out for special attack. The'general
market has showed itself coldly unresponsive
and there has been nothing like a general break
in prices at any time. Holders of the standard
railroad stocks have held on with stubborn
tenacity, and the most marked result of the
slump of a few individual stocks has been the
lethargy engendered in the general list Tiie
buying demand for stocks, to be sure, showed
signs at times of coming to a complete stand
still, but there was such a small supply offering
for sale at the same time that prices of many
Btocka offered a firm resistance to any decline
The moneyed class persisted in Its waiting atti
â¢ tud< ]â¢ is a commentary upon the public feel
ing toward new Industrial flotations that the
most vulnerable point of attack has been in the
steel stocks, in spite of the fact mat enormous
profits ire being realized in the production
and manuiacture of all grades of this material
The uneasiness in the London and Paris stock
markets on the Transvaal situation and the
Cabinet crisis In France, and the money strin
gency In Berlin, Vienna. Franfort and Amster
(lain, on account of large speculative commit
mÂ«-nts in the Berlin market, have been more or
less reflected here and have added to the fear
of a drain of gold which might ultimately affect
our money markets. On the other hand the
Improved crop outlook, the good earnings by
railroads,, the continued ease of money the gen
era! business prosperity and the return from
Europe of several financiers of influence and
authority have served as sustaining factors and
even to advance prices in a number o f railroads

WHEAT AND OTHER GRAINS.
WHEATâ The tables are turned and the bears
have taken charge of the market. Chicago de

Snow reported indications for a yield of 275,-
OO'J.OCO bushels of winter and as much sprlr.g
wheat, with the latter looking extremely Aril.
Western receipts for the week were 15,500.000
bushels, against 8,500,000 for the same week in
1898 and 1,500,000 in 1837. There was still consid
erable July wheat to be liquidated, and the.
outlook was for lower prices. Foreigners were
free sellers. In which they were joined by St.
Louis and Chicago. The bulls apparently lost
courage and the bears hammered tha market
down.
The local market was naturally off under
these bearish conditions, and futures declined.

DECIDUOUS AND CITRUS FRUITS.
The canners are paying the following prices:
Peaches. $20 for frees and t3O for clings; Apri
cots. $16955 per ton, according to size, quality
and district; Bartlett Pears, J40@50 per ton;
Green and Yellow Plums, $20 per ton.
Yesterday was an unusually dull day. Re
ceipts were not large, but the demand was
poor. Prices stood about the same for all de
scriptions.
The demand in the interior for canning ac
count is as brisk as ever and prices rule firm.
The scarcity in Bartlett Pears Is well illus
trated by the fact that the canners, being un
able to find any uncontracted lots to fill their
orders, are obliged to buy from the shippers,
and are cheerfully paying $45Â©50 per ton. This
is a great year for the California fruit grower.
Cantaloupes from Winters brought $1 25 per

A QUEER SCOTCH LAIRD.
Able to Block a Bridge So as to Save
His Ferry.
If Scotchmen have not lost their native
shrewdness the ebullitions of landlordism
which are constantly reported should
teach a wholesome lesson to those who,
i during recent years, have been lured into
i the landlord's political camp. No doubt
the permeation of the country with Tory
ism encourages a more haughty insistence
upon proprietorial rights. Within the past
few weeks J. W. H. Grant, the Laird of
Elchles. has given an amiable exposition
of his views as to his duties as a land
owner. Over the Spey, between Aberlour
and Elchies, is a ferry belonging- to this
young Laird. Owing to the danger of
! crossing by the ferry-boat when the cur
i rent is strong; there has long been an
I agitation for the provision of a footbridge
I over the river, and the recent drowning
of two prominent residents brought the
movement to a climax.
The requisite funds for the purpose have
been guaranteed, and all the Laird of El
chies was asked to do was to grant a site
for the pier of the bridge at the ferry on
the north bank of the Spey. Once before
when he was approached on the subject
j he laid down the practically prohibitive
condition that the bridge should be built
at a spot where the river is so wide that
the work would have cost thousands in
stead of hundreds of pounds. This time
he has refused to grant the proposed site
on the ground that if he did so he would
"run the risk of losing a valuable patri
monial interest in the ferry, which, by the
substitution of a bridge, might be entirely
j lost." A request of the local authorities
I that he should name any terms he wished
to Impose was met witha further refusal;
and. consequently, though there seems to
be an undoubted right of way over the
river, the erection of a bridge is prevent
ed. The value of the "patrimonial in
! terest" which is thus allowed to stand in
the way of the safety and convenience of
the public may be estimated from the fact
i that the ferry, combined with a house and
; farm, produces a rent of Â£18 a year!â

Workhouse for Acred Animals.
The Englishman (Calcutta) contains a
most Interesting account of the workhouse
or asylum for aped and infirm beasts and
birds that was established pome thirteen
years ago by a society of influential Hii -
dus. It is near tho Sodopur Station, about
ten miles from Calcutta, and is under the
control of a manager, with a staff of
eighty servants and an experienced vet
erinary surgeon. In the place at present
there are 970 paupersâ to wit, 129 bulls. 307
cows, 171 calves. 72 horses, 13 water buffa
loes. 69 sheep. 15 proats. 141 pipeons. 41
cocks and hens. 4 cats. 3 monkeys and i
dogs. This remarkable asylum is de
scribed as being most systematically and
mercifully managed. The cow paupers
have especially a pood time of it. inas
much as on the occasion of the "mela"
natives po from far and near to deconte
and worship them.

I QVT, If you will bear in mind that one
I of thÂ» rules of Nidderdlnka Land is
I that no one shall ever say "don't,"
I you will understand why Aldare waa
I bo jolly as he was niarched along by
I the Bullfrogs. As no one could say to
I him, "Don't mash the Queen's black-
I berry," he had not broken any rule by
I mashing it. It was also true that if
I he should take it Into his mind to try
Ito run away fi'om th^> Bullfrogs the
I leader and captain of the frogs could
I not say "Don't" nor tell him to stop.
I But Aldare had no wish to run away.
IWe came to a hill for 1 went with
I Aldare in order that this account
I min'ht be written for your bej
I and there Aldare showed his love of
I fun by throwing the mashed black-
I berry in front of the leader of the
| frogs, who stepped upon it and b!
and all the other frogs, like Jill wh n she" T^TT^^vd Jack,
tumbling- after." It waa his turn then to arrest the frogs for mash-
Ing the blackberry, and they went along willingly enough until we
came to the Nidfierdinks Town, and every frog had the black stain of
the Juice of the blackberry upon his white v< si an 1 green coal to ac
cuse him. I will confess that I was eager to see the Queen â 
Nidderdinks. She lives In a great hollow in a redwood tree. Over
the front door prows a vine that has myriads of purple flowers on if
and the flowers hang down like tassels. No one planted the vine; no
one hojlowed out the redwood tree for the Queen's use. Th
and the vine were just the same when the first Queen of Nidder
dir.ks Land was brought in on a moonlighi night by the Stork.
How the tree was hollowed and where the vine came fromâ for there
is no other vine on the whole earth Just like it â you must reason out
â  lurself.

.'..-â¢ later, as his little grand
child sat "ii his knee, he told hi r how,
in a sequestered nook In a far-off cor
ner ol the earth he had seen what he
felt suie must be two mountain elfs.
But they weren't elfs after all. Only
two dear little girls who lived with
their fathi mother in a half
cabin, ha nestling in one of
the upper valleys of the Sierras. The
cabin was built from hewn timber
taken from the forests which covered
the whole land, excepi here ami there
the steep mountain side, which had
been made bare by some terrible ava
lanche or landslide. One little stream
traced Its infant way quite near the
, and its water was cold as cold
could b .
It was an ideal spot with its wild
flowers, birds, tiny stream, log cabin,
forests and great mountains, all tem
pered with a delicious quiet. To
matter-of-fact people it would have
been very lonely, for th" nearest neigh
bors in this roomy spot were miles
away. To this little family it seemed
all heavenly.
The doctorâ for stich was the father
of th^. childrenâ had speni many very
busy years in San Francisco. At last
old age stole from him the energy to
battle on amid rushing peoples, and.

"Poor children," respcmded the Queen. "They have fathers and
mothers who stuff them with cake and candy and then wonder
why they are sick so niurh, and then they call doctors, who fill the
children up with nasty medicines.
"They have mothers who take them out shopping and drag them
along by one hand when they are too tired to walk, and then shake
them for crying.
"They are made to study all sorts of things and then are ex
amine! within an inch of their lives by school teachers for promo
tion â whatever that is.
"They live in stuffy houses, study stuffy bonks, wear shoes and
stockings â my! but I think that their educations are badly neglected,
after all.
"There isn't one baby outside of Xidderdinks Land who can talk
with a bear and be understood. There isn't one baby in your coun
try who can call an eagle down out of the sky; nor is there one to
whom the fishes will come to he pptt^d when she wades in the brook.
"Oh! 1 am sorry for the children outside of Nidderdinks Land. I
am regularly sorry for any child who has to hear some one say
don't twenty times a day."
This was quite a speech for the Queen -the longest that she had
ever made. It was of no use for me to tell her that the babies out

her an ever- varying delight and won

she would say. "1 shall write of all this

slde of Nidderdinks Land have fine times at Fourth of July and at
Christmas. She silenced me by asking whether I would rather be
harpy all the time or only once in a\ hile? The loss of her black
berry did not seem to trouble the Queen at all. The fun with the
frogs paid her for the mishap of Aldare. The frogs went to play in
a brook near by and washed the stains from their clothes. Aldare
curled up under a clump of wild flowers and went to sleep to get
rested after his long jaunt.
A pudgy little brown hand, which belonged to the Queen, was
held out to me. The Queen and I walked on, upon tiptoe, that we
might not awaken Aldare, who smiled in his sleep. Hand in hand,
after the fashion of Nidderdinks Land, where all are friends and
there are no quarrels, the Queen and I Journeyed like boon com
panions.
"Let's go and see If any new babies came into Nidderdinks Land
last night," proposed the Queen.
The nursery in Nidderdinks Land is a queer place. Sure enough
it is a cavp, with a real roof of rock and stone walls, and with a
big front door having a shiny br~ss bell knob on it. The Queen
went up to the front dour and rang the bell. Tinkle, tinkle. The
door was suddenly opened and the funniest looking nurse that you
can think of stood before us.
Did you ever see a cozy owl with a white cap, tied with broad,
white strings over its funny little head, sitting on a fence rail,
winking and blinking at the sun -now gravely looking straight ahead
into space, and now. upon hearing your footfalls, turning its head
around with a jerk, until it would seem that it must twist its funny
headâ stTring eyes and allâ straight off? Such was the Nidderdink
nurse that came to the door then, ('lose behind the nurse stood
the Stork, grinning and happy over the latest baby in Nidderdinks
Land.
"What is the color of the new baby?" asked the Queen. "Red,
white or blue?"
"Blue!"
The cozy Owl and the Stork were at once convuls.-d with fun.
"Blue? Little Queen, wh'.-re did you ever get such a funny idea
from?"
"Why, the one that came two weeks ago was red. Then the
next one was white. 1 thought that ili^ next must be blueâ we are,
all so fond of the Red. White and Blu^, you know."
"To tell you tho truth." said the cozy Owl. "1 am puzzled about
the new baby. My eyes are getting a little poor, perhaps, and so I
may be mistaken, but the new baby looks like one that we have
had here before."
"And has f.Â»o]ed the Stork into bringing it here the second time'
Well, well, that is a prank that is worthy of a true Nidd^rdinks
baby and I am proud of jt. Let me ser the baby at once."
So the cozy Owl went to a Title crib and took up th^ blackest
drowsily asked. "Oh, dear, what's the
matter?"
"Please. Ollie, just turn and look at
this," said Checne, "and T'll tell you
something that has just come to me.
Are you listening. Ollie?" She stopped
for a reply. There was beside her a
peacefully slumbering cherub. Ollie
had fallen to sleep again.
"Dear sister, you must hear, you
must see," said Oheche, reawakening
Ollie. Then, jumping from her bod,
she went to the window, where she
stood a small, white figure, wrapped

in th*> moonlight Something in her
manner startled her little companion
and the sleepy blue eyes opened widely.
"Just see how yonder moonlight sheds
loveliness over our great, rugged nmun-
tains! How it steals in and out among
the trees, as if it was afraid it was in
truding upon that deep solitude! How
I love it! It looks bo soft and beauti

Oh, you big, round moon!" said she.
stretching out her little arms, "if you
would only take me nearer and, just
once, let me touch your pure white
ness.
She hesitated contemplatively and
then continued:
"I woke you so as to tell what hap
pened as I lay thinking there," pointing
to the hed. "Something whispered in
my ear. murmuring thus: "1 am a lit
tle moonheam fairy, and night is the
time J work and play. Some say I'm
really good for nothing, and it makes
me very, very sad to hear It. I want
every one to love me, as I know you
do. I've peeked in at your window
often and you've always greeted me so
sweetly.'
"'I feel quite sad and pensive to

now. Be sure you Keep me in your
heart and cherish me fondly there. Tell
those who complain of my wandering,
nocturnal habits to love me, because I
only struggle to be good and beauti
ful.' "
"It was gone. I called, but all was
silent."
She stood a moment dreamily and
then spoke softly.
"How beautiful! Dear moonbeam
fairy!"
She clasped her little hands in tpnder
joy and turnpd to her sister. But Ollie

Cheches tale she could not understand.

little baby that this world has ever seen â in or out of NldderdlnkS
Land.
"Have you given him a bath yet?"
"No, T hay been too busy with the yellow baby that was brought
in from China and the funny little girl with the towsled hair who
has just arrived from the Philippine Isiands."
"Well, that Mack baby is too black. He is either worse or better
than a blackberry- Dear Aldare"â for Aldare had just come along,
having finished his nap very soonâ "was the blackberry that you
had from the grizzly bear cubs as black as this baby?"
"No, Indeed!"
Aldare made a cup of leaves and ran to the brookside and filled
the cup with water. Into the limpid water went his fat, berry
stained fingers. Upon the face of the "new" black baby his fingers
were placed. Where his fingers rubbed across the black velvet cheeks,
thai were wrinkled suddenly by mischievous grins, were tell-tale
white marks- one for each finger on Aldare's hand.
"Ho, a wonder!" said the merry Aldare.
All the Xidderdinks babies who had been brought around there
by their curiosity took part in the "lark" that followed. The "new"
baby was n^t a "new" baby at all, but was Pepperknell, a little
white boy, who was very small for his merry four years. He had
followed the Stork on one of his journeys and had seen the gTeat
bird coming home to Nidderdinks Land with a little black baby
from Ethiopia.
"Hi, Aspen Leaf," Pepperknell had then whispered excitedly. "Let
me have some fun with the Stork. Take the black baby away when
th-' Stork goes to sleep and tell me where I can blacken myself so
that the Stork will mistake me for the baby."
A little fairy appeared with one hundred companions. They kept
out of view from the Stork. They traveled the same road, but flew
high that they might not be seen.
Meanwhile other fairies had stained Pepperknell's skin with black-
berry juice and had put a polish upon him with the leaves of tha
black waJnut. Now the Stork put the black baby down and had
gone to sleep under a shady tree.
"Hi. there, look sharp!" said Pepperknell.
In a jiffy the black baby was whisked away to Fairyland â where
he still is. In a jiffy Pepperknell took the black baby's place.
All this became known to the shame-faced Stork when he saw
Pepperknell turning to white in the brook, to which the Nidderdinks
babies had dragged him.
"Peep, pc e-e-p." It was the linnet who spoke.
"Ha, ha. ha, ha. hahahahahahahahahaha." So laughed a bobolink.
"Come," said the joyous Queen of the NiddÂ»rdinks to me. "Let
us go on and see what else has happened in Nidderdinks Land."

Cheche was disappointed, but did not
awaken her sister this time. The ex

to her bed, she, too, was soon fast

. Last Tuesday night there was a pood
attendance of members in the hall of Cali
fornia Council to witness the initiation of
. six candidates for that council and one
for Fosemite Council. After the. work
there was an hour of entertainment fur
nished by the National Union Quartet
and members of the council under the di-
Speaker Gibson.
The unanimous election as senator of
.Fred H. Hastings, past president of Cali
*. fornia Council, and that with a can
" didate being placed against him in nomi
Â° nation; by the assembly of the order in
â¢this State was a very flattering compli
ment- to a most painstaking and consci
entious member of the order.- Mr. Has
tings filled the office of president of Cali
-4 fornia Council with great credit to the
council and himself and as president of
the senate for one term he made an excel
" lent- record. His zeal for the order and
â¢ his dp-sire to see it advanced in the race
for .fraternal preference is a guarantee
that a? senator he- will work hard in the
â¢ High-C.ouncfl.of the union.

J4av"2 FisKes JYlemory?
ZOOLOGISTS have long been in doubt
as to whether fishes are gifted with
the faculty of remembering persons
and places, or not. Some claim that
they cannot remember, while others in
sist that they are endowed with memory,
though possibly only in a limited degree.
The following story seems to show that
the latter are right. A student of the
Polytechnic School, in Paris, recently no
ticed that whenever he walked with
some friends in the Luxembourg Garden
the fishes in the large basins there regu
larly followed him as he strolled around
the little ponds.
As the students never feed the fishes and
hardly pay any attention to them, such
conduct was inexplicable until !t was
solved by the gardener, whose duty it is
to feed the fish. The uniform worn by
the students of the Polytechnic School ia
black, with red stripes, and that worn by
the gardener and other attendants is very
similar.
Now. evidently the fish thought that the
students were gardeners, who hail come
to supply them with food, as in no other
way can we account for their habit of
following the students whenever they
walked round the basins. We must con
clude, therefore, that, whatever may be
the case with other fish, those at least in
the Luxenbourg Gardens have an excel
lent memory.

Largest Family or\ Record.
IN the Harleian manuscript Xos. 7R and
9SO in the library of the British Muse
um mention is made of the most ex
traordinary family that has ever been
known in the world's history. The parlies
were a Scotch weaver and his wife (not
wives), who were father and mother of
sixty-two children.
The majority of the offspring of this
prolific pair were boysâ exactly how many
is not knownâ for the record mentions the
fact that forty-six of the male children
lived to reach manhood's estate, and only
Hales.
four of the daughters lived to be grown
up women. Thirty-nine of the sons were
still living- in the year 1630, the majority
of them then residing in and about N<
castle-on-Tyne.
It is recorded in one of the old historii 9
of S'rivcastle that 'a eertyne grentleman
of large estaytes" rode "thirty-and-1 1
milvs beyond the Tyne to prove this won
derful story." It is further related that
Sir J. Bowers adopted ten of th< suns and
three other "landed gentlemen" took ten
each. The remaining members of the ex
traordinary family were brought up by
the parents.
"landed gentlemen," says Woman's
Life of London, "are not now so fond of
collecting 1 boys. All their time is required
for collecting rents."
A horse will travel 400 yards in four and
one-half minutes at a walk, 400 yards in
two minutes at a trot.' 400 yards in one
minute at a gallop. The usual work of
a horse is taken at 22.500 pounds raised
one foot per minute for eight hours per
day. A horse will carry 2">o pounds twen
ty-five miles per day of eight hours. An
average draught horse will draw IGOO
pounds twenty-three miles per day on a
level road, weight of wagon included. The
average weight of a horse is 1000 pounds,
and his strength is equivalent to that of
five men.
