The correspondent of the Associated

are mortally afraid of the â¢ Americans,
however strong their position. They
make but a brief and feeble resistance,
and run when the terrible American yell
reaches their ears, whereupon- the Ameri
cans pursue them and -slay many.
The moral effect of the news that 60.000
troops are on their way here has been un
questionably great.
The insurgents "are suffering more from
disease than the Americans, owing to
poor food, lack of medicines and filthy
hospitals, with the. result that there is
great mortality among them. General
I.awton ha* Intercepted a telegram from
an insurgent captain to a Filipino gen

AGUINALDO WITHIN
THE CORDON OF TROOPS
WASHINGTON, Nov. 13.-Instead of
being at Bayambong, as supposed from
! trary she wascompleted according
j to the contract and specifications
by May 5, 1889. Certain changes
j and alterations authorized by the
I p >vernment were made, and the
I cruiser was accepted by the Gov-
I eminent in November of that
year.
The successful launching and
satisfactory completion of this
j huge war vessel, the first of our
new navy and the first one of any
of our warships to be built on this
coast, was the occasion of great
! rejoicing and congratulations
i among the people of San Fran-
I cisco. and a large public demoh
| stration was held in honor
thereof.
From that time to the present
the vessel and her movements
General Otis' previous dispatches, Aguin
aldo Is believed to be within the cordon
of American troops established by the
energy of Generals Lawton, ..lacArthur
and Wheaton. It appears In the lipht df
later information that Agulnaldo was
headed for Kayambong. where he pro
posed to establish his headquarters, but
it Is apparent that he delayed his go
ing too long. In any event the capture
of his private secretary and property
shows that Aguinaldo is not far away,
and If by any chance he has succeeded
in P'-'tthitf past th^ American lines or is
able to slip through, immediate measures
will be taken to cut him off.
General Otis has notified Secretary Root
that the transports now in the harbor
'â f Manila will with the troops on board
proceed at once to San Fabian, where
they will join other transports with such
troops .inf'ifr command r Â»f General
Wheaton us can l>p spared and tho '-om
bined force, commanded by GenÂ«ra.l
Wheaton, will proceed to Aparri, which
will be occupied, and a rapid Journey will
be made from the north coast of I^uzon
down Cagrayan and Magat rivers to nay
ambong or to such other point at which
Aguinaldo may be located.
The energetic advance made by the col
umns operating under the command of
General Otla is extremely gratifying to
Secretary Root and other department of
ficials, especially in view of the existing
climatic conditions. General Lawton's
advance is particularly regarded as a mil
itary success, and whether or not Aguin
aldo is within the cordon which has been
established by his activity it is evident
that many of the Insurgent troops have
not succeeded in escaping and these will
be captur?d or destroyed.
General Otis in his dispatches states
that the insurgents will not escape to the
mountain capital, Bayambong. without
great difficulty and loss, if at all. and
undoubtedly the officials say, he includes
Aguinaldo among the insurgent force.
As General I,awton and General Wheaton
have advanced they .have left strong de
tachments at Strategic points, and an of
ficial with whom I talked said that these
detachmonts were so stationed that Gen
eral Mac Arthur at Tarlac might be con
sidered the center of a semi-circle whese
circumference begins at Arayat, where
General Lawtnn established his base of
supplies. Thirteen miles away, at San
Tsi(iro, another force is establisned.
Twelve miles northward, at Cabanatuan,
still another force. Talavera, eleven
miles from Cabanatuan, is also garri
soned, and Aligua to the westward, form-
Ing the apex of an equilateral triangle, is
likewise garrisoned.
From Tallvera General Lawton ad
vanced to San Jose, fourteen miles away,
leaving a strong force there, thtn follow
ing the road, continued to Lupac, nine
miles from San Jose, where he estab
lished another detachment five miles from
Lupac. At Humingham the American
soldiers are- on guard and at San Quen
tin, four miles from that point, are addi
tional troops. Still farther northward, at
Tayug and San Nicholas, are General
Lawton's troops, and General Otis be
lieves they have established communica-
tion with General Wheaton. The latter
has his nase of supplies at San Fabian
and is believed to have moved to the
southward to Mangaldan and thence to
San Jacinto, Blnaloa and San Miguel,. the
latter being only seven miles from San
have always been of the greatest
interest to the people of our
city, who felt a sort of pro
prietorship in her, and her loss
will be especially lamented here,
and all over the coast as weil.
Her dimensions were: Length,
318 feet; breadth of beam, 46;
mean draught, 18.6; displace
ment, 3730 tons; indicated horse
power, 66(06.6; speed. 18.2 knots
average for four hours. She was
built of steel, with two propellers,
one funnel and two masts with
military tops. Her main battery
consisted of two 8-inch breech
loading rifle guns and six 6-inch
breech-loading rifles. Her sec
ondary battery contained four
6-pounder rapid fire guns, two
3-pounder rapid fire, two
Nicholas, General Lawton's farthest ad
vance post.
Colonel Hays of the Fourth Cavalry is
at C'arrangian, to the eastward of Law
ton's line, and will cut off such insur
gents as may succeed in getting through
the lines. These stations will be main
tained while General Mac Arthur is mov
ing to the northward along the railroad,
with arms outstretched, sweeping the in
surgents before him and toward a line of
the American troops which General Law
ton and General Wheaton have estab
lished. Of course, it will be impossible
to break the cordon until tne territory
now covered by the American troops is
entirely clear of the Insurgents. The de
moralized condition of Aguinaldo's troops
shows dearly, the authorities say. that
they are unfit for further operations, and
ft Is expected that the nexi few days will
bring excellent news from the Philip
pines.
BRITISH NAVAL OFFICER
PRAISES OUR SOLDIERS
LONDON, Nov. 13â A British naval offi
cer, who has just returned from a tour in
the Philippines, has been interviewed re
garding the situation there, of which he
takes a somewhat pessimistic view. Ac
cording to the published interview, he
thinks that more river gunboats are
needed and that Gener.al Otis is trying to
run the campaign too economically. Pay
ing a high tribute to the "surprising intel
ligence and confidence of the American
soldier," the officer says:
"Patience and bravery of the American
soldier has been shown in a high degree,
but he is not particularly mobile. He
would be more efficacious if, instead of
being collected in comparatively enor
mous numbers, he were used in smaller
forces, moving more rapidly and living on
the country instead of requiring vast
quantities of potted luxuries. Moreover,
he looks tired, and as if he wanted some
thing to do. Now, if he were a British sol
dier, he would be diverted by all sorts of
sports."

UNDER MAYOR CLARK
Sacramentans Likely to Receive Ap-
pointments From the New
Executive.
SACRAMENTO. Nov. 13.â Considerable
speculation is being indulged in as to the
appointments to be made by Mayor-elect
Clarke. Notwithstanding the various in
fluences that are being brought to boar
in the Interests of certain candidates, the
chief executive of the city intends to urn
his own judgment in the selection of suit
able men.
The greatest interest is being centered
in the fight for Chief of Police. There are
several candidates in the field, but it is
understood that John E. Sullivan, the
popular deputy Assessor, will get the
plum. Sullivan has a host of friends who
are working indefatigably to secure the
appointment for him. It is understood
that Hiram W. Johnson will be Corpora
tion Counsel and William Mullenney will
be City Surveyor, to succeed himself. Ar
thur E. Miller will be clerk to the Mayor.

The Charleston was sent to the
Asiatic station in August, 1894,
where she remained until the
winter of 1897-98.
At the time of the breaking out
of the Spanish-American war she
was at Mare Island undergoing
some repairs. These were hur
ried to completion and she left
I this port as escort to the first
military expedition to the Philip
pines on May 25, under the com
mand of Captain Glass.
On her way out, under in
structions from Washington, she
will be appointed clerk 'of the Police
Court.
The Mayor has not yet made up his
mind whom he will select as Superin
tendent of the City Cemeteries.

MOTHER-IN-LAW'S BACK
Illinois Woman Placed Under Arrest
on a Warrant Charging Her
With Murder.
AURORA, 111., Nov. 13.â Mrs. Ada Ash
ley Hill was arrested here to-night
charged with the murder of her mother
in-law, Mrs. Eliza Hill, by pouring acid
down her back. Mrs. Hill died on No
vember 5 as the result, physicians swear,
of acid burn:. Those who say the aged
woman was murdered give as a motive a
trouble of long standing among the mem
bers of the Hill family over property esti
mated at $40,000.

THE METEORIC SHOWER
PRINCETON, N. J., Nov. kâ Professor
Charles A. Young to-day completed ar

morning between 1 and 3 o'clock. Pro
fessor Young has adjusted a larger tele
scope In the Halstead Observatory
through which Assistant Professor Reed
will photograph the meteors by means of
a camera strapped to the lens of the
telescope. Commenting on the meteoric
shower Professor Young suid:
"It may be that part of the shower has
already fallen and that we missed it.
Calculation as to the exact time of their
appearance is difficult on account of the
movement of certain planets. We hope,
however, to obtain .some good photo
graphs of meteors which fail on Thursday
morning-." .

4 FRANKFORT, Ky., Nov. 13.â 4
4 Senator Goebel and the Democratic +
â¦ leaders are still waiting on the final +'
4 action of the county- boards of elec- 4
â¦ tions In Jefferson, Christian, Knox, 4
4 Johnson and other counties. It is 4
4 claimed that enough fraudulent 4
4- votes will be thrown out in these 4
â¦ counties to give Goebel a majority 4
4 on the face of the returns. The city 4
4 is excited to-night over a rumor 4
â¦ that the Governor intends to de- 4
4 clare martial law in the event that 4
4 Knox and Johnson counties are 4
4 thrown out and that he will refuse 4
4 to recognize Goebel as Governor 4
4 under such conditions. This rumor 4
4 . of martial law is not generally 4
4 credited, though there is almost 4
4 certain to be a serious clash be- 4
4 tween Governor Bradley and the 4
4 claimant. . +
Louisville, k>-., Nov. n.-The tangle
growing out of last week's election grows
worse with each day. This was the third
da) of the official count, but the work of
the county boards of canvassers disclosed
little information to clear the situation.
Chairman Long of the Republican cam
paign committee to-day repeated his claim
of a pluraility of 3111 for Taylor, based on
official returns from 110 counties and un
official returns from the remaining nine.
The Democratic papers and leaders here
have ceased to give figures, but specials
from Frankfort quote Candidate Goebel
i.nd other party leaders as saying they
are confident oi the success of the Kenton
County man.
The completion of the returns to be pre
sented to the State Board of Election
Commissioners when it meets at Frank
fort next month still depends upon the
rmination of the contests which are
being raised in several parts of the State,
notably the strongly Republican counties
of the Eleventh District, where the Demo
crats claim tissue- ballots were used.
These contests have aroused much feeling
in the localities involved, one of them In
volves the vote of Knox County, which
gave Taylor 1398 plurality. To-day Bar
boursville, the county seat, was visited by
hundr. .:.- â  Interested in the re
sult, their avowed purpose being to see
that justice is done.
Counsel for Candidate Taylor began ac
tion In the Knox County District Court to
compel the county election officers to cer
tify the vote to the State Board of Elec
tion Commissioners. â¢ The contention is
over 42 ballots from the First Precinct,
but the petition filed by Taylor's counsel
asserts that the election officers purpose
to throw out the county. ' Judge Brown
granted a temporary injunction against
such action. Johnson and Lewis counties
are affected by the Democratic charges of
Irregularities and lesral complications are
likely to arise.
At llopkin^ville a contest of a precinct
which gave Taylor a plurality of 5*5 is de
laying the oflicial return of tho vote of
Christian County, which gave Taylor a
plurality of 760.
Slow progress was made in the count
of Louisville and Jefferson counties to
day, the Commissioners being at work on
the Third Ward when they adjourned
until to-morrow. Both sides are lighting
every inch of the ground.
A number of precincts are in contro
versy on the ground of alleged irregulari
ties. In one caseâ the Seventh Precinct
of the First Wardâ th< anti-Qoebel people
to-day secured an offer from Judge Toney
to compel the precinct officers to sign the
tally sheets. The â¢ Juebrl people, however,
claim the ballot-box had been opened be
fore it reached tli^ county election offl-
The vote, bo far as canvassed, shows
little change from the unofficial ligures.
The. Federal Grand Jury, which was
adjourned over the election, reconvened
this morning, and was charged by Judge
Evans regarding election violations, par
ticularly with reference to' the intimida
tion of colored voters. He recited the
charges which had reached the ears of
the court, described in detail the offenses
upon which indictments should be found
and continued:
"Conspiracies may be hard to prove, but
It Is by no means impossible to prove
them, both by direct and circumstantial
evidence; and if you should tind the evi
dence and indict those who engage in
those conspiracies you would get ;tt a
class of men most liki-ly of higher or at
least mure pretentious grade than their
in. .ls. This class Is far more' dangerous
to tire community, and their punishment
much inure desirable in every way than
the others. However, both classes should
be Indicted. The highest duty is imposed
upon you to vindicate the law, and you
will the more efficiently and commend
ably discharge that duty if you shall
probe matters to the bottom and without
fear or favor indict every- man, however
prominent or however obscure, who his
engaged in any conspiracy to perpetrs :
the wrongs denounced by the statute.
"The court also suggests to you that
it is by no means impossible for officials
of high or low degree to engage in such
schemes, and where that is the case the
demand for punishment is all the more
imperative, because an example should be
set in the. case of those who are charged
with the enforcement of the law who
make themselves the Instrument of Its
violation."
PORTSMOUTH, Ohio. Nov. 13 -Thia i
was an exciting; day at Vanceburv Ky !
county seat of Lewis County, twenty
miles bel >vi h^re. An effon was mad.- to
thn.w ..ut the < ntire vote of the county
Which gave Taylor a plurality of On ,',,[
a technicality, It being claimed that the
paper on which the ballots were prlu ed
was too thin. On this ground the election
board last week threw out the vota of
Mowers and Uurtonvllle precincts, which
gave Taylor 209 plurality, and adjourned
till to-day. Word was passed through

around the Courthouse when the ele lion
board met at 10 a. m.
News reached the crowd that the com
mission. -is wf-re about to throw out the

EASTERN CITIES SIDE
WITH PACIFIC COAST
Philadelphia Opposes the Claims
of St. Louis Before the Com=
merce Commission.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
ST. LOUIS, Nov. 13.â The Interstate j
Commerce Commission met this morning
to hear the complaint of the Business
Men's League of St. Louis. All the mem- j
bers of the commission were present ex
cept Governor Fifer, who will sit with i
them to-morrow. Ex-Commissioner Cal- '
houn appeared as one of the counsel for i
the Business Men's League of St. Louis.
The Pacific Coast Jobbers' and Manu
facturers' Association asked leave to file
an intervention, which was granted. This :
pleading presents the case of the Pacific
Coast association, which is composed of j
the leading merchants and manufacturers i
from Seattle to San Diego.
It sets up the fact of water competition
between all Pacific Coast points and j
the Atlantic seaboard, which controls the
through rates by rail; that this is one of
the natural advantages of Pacific Coast
cities; that the St. Louis merchant is
seeking, by this proceeding to have the i
railroad rates readjusted so as to offset j
the disadvantages of his location and ex
tend his trade farther west at the ex
pense of the Pacific Coast dealer; that it
is the right of the cities of the Pacific !
Coast to enjoy and retain their natural
advantages; that the Middle West has
already extended its trade farther west
than it is naturally entitled to do by
reason of a contest between competing i
carriers which enabled them to Blip into j
territory not before occupied on account !
of unusual and extraordinary conditions j
of rates; that this disputed territory is i
now occupied by dealers from both sides '
and competition is keen, with the usual |
result of unreasonably low profits; that j
the St. Louis merchant has gone to the
commerce commission for assistance in
tin's struggle for trading grounds.
When the paper was presented Chair
man Knapp asked the attorney for the
association whether the association's in
terests were the same as those of the
railroads, and he replied that they were
not. This, he said, was essentially a
fight between the merchants of the
Middle West and those of the Pacific
and the evidence to be produced
for the association was very different
from that of the railroads. Their inter
of five alleged "repeaters," who are said
to have been brought t" this city from
Washington by Lieutenant Kodgers of
the capital police and who are under hail

land, one of the defendants, who acted as
minority inspector on election day,' tes
tified that under Baiter's direction he as-
Fisted in depositing 800 ballots iv the box
before the pulls opened. H<> also testified
that only 124 legal votes were fast in the
division, while the returns showed .139 of

publican candidate for State Treasurer,
and only five for his Democratic op
ponent. Thomas J. Ryan, candidate for
City Commissioner on the ticket with
Creasey, was glvpn 145 votes in the re
turns for the division.
Ball was also entered tn-day in the sum
of $1000 for Joseph Rodgers, lieutenant of
the capita! police, and Clarence M-eeser.
another of the alleged "repeaters."
Neither of the two men could be found,
and the ball was furnished by John F.
Baiter, a member of the State legisla
ture. The warrants for Rodgers and
Meeser were issued after the hearing of
the Washington nun. Rodgers and Meesi r
will be given a hearing on Thursday,
when Deputy Coroner Salter will be ar
raigned.

MILWAUKEE, Nov. 13.â Henry G.
Payne, National Republican Committee
man of Wisconsin, this afternoon gave it
ns hi.s opinion that < 'hicnun would be the
place selected tor holding the next Na
: tlonal Republican Convention.
"It seems likely that Chicago will be
chosen ns the place for holding the Na
tional Republican Convention," said Mr.
Payne. "It i.s the natural nlace for the
(â .invention, and probably has the best
chance for pettinp: it. So fnr as I know,
Milwaukee Is not a candidate. I ?rw
, something In a Chicago paper to the effect
. that Milwaukee was trying to get It. but
it is too late for Milwaukee to enter the
race. You see. it Is only about three
weeks before the time for the meeting of
the National Committee. I understand
that Kansas C4ty. St. Louis, Denver mid
other cities are after it. but Chicago per
: haps hus the advantage."

ests were not the pame in all respects,
though similar In some.
The firm of Hibbard, Spencer & Bartlett
of Chicago, and that or Kelly & Maus,
both hardware dealers, and also three
grocery houses, asked, to Intervene, at- did
the Merchants' Bureaus of Kansas City,
Milwaukee, St. Paul, Minneapolis arij
St. Joseph, Mo.
on the other hand, the Philadelphia
Hardware Merchants' and Manufacturers'
Association sent a telegram to the com
mission asking to Join with the Pacific
Coast in opposing the claims of St. Louis
business men set up in this proceeding,
and protesting against the establishment
of graded rates for their benefit.
It' is thought that other cities of the
East will join with Philadelphia for the
pro lection of their Interests in the trade
of the Pacific Coast.
The first witness called for the com-'
plainant was its traflic manager. Van
Landlngham, whose testimony seemed to
give much more satisfaction to the Pa
cific Coast people than to his employers.
He admitted he was working for the busi
ness men of St. .Louis on a good salary
and it was his duty to get all he could
for them, fie wanted the rates graded
from New York west according to the
mileage until the Missouri River was
reached, and far enough west of that to
serve the interests of St. Louis, but he
could not tell detinitely where the process
should stop. The whole rate question, he
said, should be reconsidered and. the rat^s
revised to put the St. Louis merchants
on an equal footing with those in the
Bast, and so on to the Pacific Coast. He
did not claim the railroads were earning
too much money under existing condi
tions. The St. Louis man could now com
pete with the Pacific Coast, through to
the Pacific Ocean, in large quantities of
goods, but he wanted the rates revised
so he could also sell to the retailers In
small lots.
Upon his cross-examination he admitted.
In answer to questions put by the attor
"ney for the Pacific Coast Association,
that the St. Louis merchants got into this
disputed rate war and when the condi
tions were unusual, and he was trying by
this proceeding to get an adjustment of
rates so they could hold this field and
go . farther westâ in short, that they
wanted all of the earth which they could
lay their hands upon.

Ladysmith had no news of the outside
world since General French reached
Pietermaritzburg and that they were
puzzled at the inactivity of the Boers.
Every one was confident and cheerful.
but were all suffering the inconvenience
of the siege, bread selling at three shill
ings per loaf.
Colonel Baden-Powell's dashing sorties j
at Mafeklng encourage the hope that the !
British garrisons along the western bar
der are able to hold out. Cecil Rhodes is j
employing Â£000 men. white and black, at
Kimberley in road-making as a remedy
for destitution.
According to a dispatch from De Aar, |
the Boers at Kimberley have got the ex- j
act range of the mines and are constantly |
throwing shells at the dynamite huts. J
Several of the latter have been .blown up |
and the damage done to the mines already !
amounts to many hundreds of pounds.
Among the stories from Urussels is one
that General Joubert and Sir George
"White have been endeavoring to nego
tiate for the capitulation cf Ladysmith,
but have failed to come to terms.
The story of Father Matthews, cabled
from Lourenza Marquez, regarding the
surrender at Nicholsons Neck, is too
vague to be very convincing, but in mill- I
tary circles it is considered unpleasant |
reading, and it will be impossible to learn i
the facts until the officer concerned has
teen court-martialed.
The report that the British cruiser
Magicienne had fired on the French
steamer Cordoba raises the doubtful point
- whether Gr^at Britain has yet actually
declared war. It is believed. . however,
that -Hurcpean nations have been
made acquainted with the severance
of relations between Great Britain and
the two republics. It is understood that
the Admiralty on General Buller's advice
has arranged that cruisers at the Cape
should go out to intercept all arriving
transports and inform them of 'the latest
or-iers respecting their destination, which
act? to be kept secret.

"The Boer intention was to have cap

There is r.o doubt, that from the Brit

Ge-r.eral Joubert- very hazardous.

ought to be possible to occupy Colenso

course to be followed by General Methu
en must r^ce^sarily be dictated entirely
by official knowledge of General White's
position ar.<s resources and the experts'
hope General Methuen will be able to
await the concentration of the whole cl
vtslon before advancing: and thus have
a better chance of dealing- a telling blow
at General Joubert's main army, which,
;it is asserted, will be caught between two
British forces and compelled cither to
fight a general action or retire to their
strongholds. The Drakensburg dispatch
by way of Durban, which was brought
in by a KaSir reporting the severe de
feat of rhe Boers at I.adysmith Thurs
day, may turn out to be correct, but in
view of the previous experience It must
be received with raution. It appears,
however, certain that heavy fighting oc-
c urred and that the lyddite of the naval
guns must have had a dire effect upon
the 1 burgher forces if It reached them.
X belated dispatch from -mith.
dated November 6, by way of Estcoart;
under date of November 9, confirms the
idea that the temporary cessation of the
Boer bombardment was due to General
Joubert awaiting the arrival of other
position guns before tackling the work
in earnest. It also says: â¢ â  ,". â â¢
"Every one is cheerful and confident.
"We can show a rigid front for weeks to

have been by train to the Boers' ad

the Red Cross Hag. News from the south
is scanty. A number of guns -are in posi
tion all around us. It was difficult at

less explosives, but a balloon managed to

"We were sent out," says Father Mat

ject of preventing two Boer forces from
joining. We started at half-past 8 on.
Sunday morning, marched ten miles and
got to the hill about 1 o'clock Monday
morning. The first mishap was that the
mountain battery stampeded and scat
tere<l the whole lot of mules. We formed
up again and "gained the top of the hill.
The mules were gone, but not all the
ammunition. I do not know what stam

It was pitch dark. : '\~ w
"We had but one hour's stop, the fight
ing beginning just after daybreak, being
somewhat slack for a time, but finally the
Boers crept round and then the firing be
came furious.
"Soon after 12 o'clock noon there was a
general cry of 'cease re,' but our fel
lows would not stop firing. Major Adye
came up and confirmed the order and then
the bugle sounded 'cease firing.'
"In our locality there was a rumor that
a white fiag was raised by a young of
ficer who thought his batch of ten men
were the sole survivors, but we were SOO
alive, having started with perhaps 1000.
I think many of the battery men were
captured. Our officers and men refused
to surrender. The Boers did not seem to
be in great numbers on the spGt. but I
heard that the main body had galloped
off. Our men had to give up their arms
and the officers were sent to Command
ant Steenkamp. The officers then ordered
the men to fall in.
"The officers were taken away from the
men and sent to General Joubert the
same day, traveling In mule wagons and
sleeping that night in some stores on the
way. The next morning they took a train
at Waschebank for Pretoria. They are
very well treated and also, I have heard,
are the men. There has been, no unpleas
antness in Pretoria. The officers are in a
school building and are allowed to walk
as they please in the grounds. The sur
render, in my judgment, was a great
blunder caused by a misunderstanding.
Major Adye was much put out. The
white flag was not hoisted by the Irish
Fusileers." '-iv-'

SCANDALS BREWING
IN THE BRITISH ARMY
SBON, Nov. 13.â Some army and
navy scan.ials of a serious character are
brewing. The Admiralty will have some
thing to answer in rt-Â£;ird to transporta
tion. The commNs:iriat department will
be called v c day to answer for
::;an and benst which have been
found unfit for use just before loading.
While a'l parties have united to support
â¢ in the crisis, severe critl
â ining as to how the earlier
of the war are being com.
â  â¢ ' ' ry is why the troops were
not mobll-r â¢ - than is being done.
Thousands of troops are now being har
ried to the front, but the question is asked
In many quarters why were they not
transported much quicker. Though many
splendid ships have been hired as trans
ports, there are some which are reckoned
b^low the standard for such purposes.
Mi:rh indignation is expressed over the
putting of soldiers on old, slow boats. The
â â¢nment has been ready and a r
to pay any, amount for the best transports
and the 1 that could be got.
A great factor in strengthening the
British force? in South Africa was the
speed of vessels, and the question is
a.=ked why the Admiralty, which is re
sponsible for the hiring of transports, did
not secure in every case the best and
fleetest vessels. I understand on high au
thority that the most serious critic of the
work of the Admiralty in this respect Is
the commander in chief himself. Lord
Wblseley. There is no complaint about
the seaworthiness of the vessels em
ployed, but many of them cannot make
more than ten knots an hour. None is
reckoned dangerous, but, seaworthiness
being granted, time being the main object,
many of the transports are not. in the
opinion of military authorities. Lord
Woiseley in particular, up to the standard
required.
It is beg unto? to be hinted that In
some instances there have been dealings
between certain subordinate Admiralty
officials and the owners of ships which
offer something more than mere grounds
of suspicion that ships are being certi
f.ed as up to the standard which ought
never to have been hired at all. for con
siderations which may mildly be termed
commissions. Without particularizing as
to the rank held by some of these officials
appointed by the Admiralty as transport
surveyors, it is well known that some of
these men are not highly paid and there
fore the temptation to quietly accept con
sideration for passing certain ships as up
to requirements has been great. There
will. no doubt, be a strict inquiry into
these irregularities. The time that is be
ing lost on the mobilization of forces in
South Africa through slow transports is
too serious to pass without it. for this
means a delay in relieving General White,
Colonel Eaden-Powell and those gallantly
holding out at Ladysmith, Kimberley and
If reinforcements arrive one day too
late it will be knnwn where the blame

owners of the Cordoba and to the author

The Soleil and the Echo de Paris pro
test in similar terms.

â¢â¢The war In South Africa has destroyed
both conventions w::h thÂ»- Transvaal. We
must establish thÂ»-re a pure and honest

give whatever solf-goverhment may be

NOT NEAR TO WAR
IN THE FAR EAST
Alarmist View Is Hardly
Justified.
Special Dispatch to The CalL
LONDON', Nov. 13 âA special dis
patch - uaghai says the
differences between Russia and
Japan have been accentuated by
Japan's refusal to grant R
foothold un the ?ea front of
unpo harbor, Korea,
LONDON', Nov. 13.â Careful Inquiries re- i
veal nothing extant in dipomatic circles
here to justify the alarmist view taken by
a section of the press regarding the sit- j
uation in the Far East. That a serious
denouement is 30 close at hand as is indi
cated by advices from Shanghai during
the last twenty-four hours is regarded as
incredible. For a long time it has been
known here and it was asserted in these
dispatches two months ago that China
ana Japan were closely allied, but neither
British nor American diplomats in London
believe that the alliance is of an offensive
nature. -=""-'
At any rate, it may be asserted posi
tively that if Japan and China contem- <

Lord Salisbury Is not aware of their in
tention, ami it is scarcely probable that
those powers â would decide upon any defi- ]
nite course Without at least consulting j
Great Britain, which, in the nature of |
things, would be their ally, whether active
or passive. However, while the. foreign
officials have no information tending to
confirm recent sensational reports, they
have come to regard the Eastern problem
as so difficult In respect to getting ac
curate information that they would be
surprised at nothing. They have endeav
ored to take precautions against every-
In the words of a British official who '
discussed the situation, "while reports of
a rupture between Russia and Japan are
easy of creation, and while they are liable
to constant reiteration so long as the dip
lomats of the press continue to view the'
Far East with such serious attention, it Is
clearly palpable that if Japan really
means to strike a serious blow at Russian
control she must do it quickly, for very
soon Russia will be far stronger than she
is now."
Discussing the bearings of Russia new
naval estimates upon this question, the
official asserted that these certainly indi
cated the Intention of the Czar to increase
the Russian fleet in Chinese waters,
which, if done on the scope outlined in the
estimates, would iÂ«*ve Japan -but little
chance. - . â --, â 
"Another phase of these reports which
has astonished me," said the official, "is
the suggestion of Chinese co-operation.
Thus far no nation has been able to
arouse the Chinese sufficiently to get them
to combine in military enterprises. If
Japan has done thisâ or even believes she
has â then she has accomplished more
than Great Britain or Russia in a century
of effort."
The action of the United States in re
questing assurances from foreign Govern
ments regarding the "open door" policy
in China has created Intense satisfaction
in official circles.
"Lord Salisbury," according to the offi
cial quoted above, "has gladly acquiesced
in this step on the part of the United
States, which is regarded a- most potent
evidence that the United States recognizes
the impossibility of conducting their for
eign affairs without the co-operation of
other nations and as the first practical
earnest of Its desire to conduct Eastern
negotiations in concert with European
Governments." \

HERESY CHARGES
MAY BE DROPPED
Case Against Professor
McGiffert.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK. Nov. 13.â case of
Professor Arthur C. McGiffert of the
Union Theological Seminary, who is
charged with holding views that are at
variance with the doctrines or the Pres
byterian church, came before the pres
bytery to-day and was referred to 'he
general assembly. A committee was ap
pointed last June to confer with Profes
sor McGiffert and prevail upon him to
withdraw from the church or at least
modify his views. Meetings have been
held, which Professor MeGiffert attend
ed, but he steadfastly refused to recede
from the stand he had taken on certain
church matters, saying that he had been
misunderstood. The general assembly
prepared expressly for Professor Mc-
Glffert's case an outline of the funda
mental principles of the church. These
were:
That the statements of the Holy Scriptures
are absolutely truthful, i. c.. free from error
when Interpreted in then- natural and intended
sense.
2â That in Jesus Christ there were two whole,
perfect and distinct natures, the God head
and manhood, being inseparably Joined together
In one person, without conversion or confusion,
si that he was In no particular liable to err.
. 3 â That the Lord's supper was instituted by
the direct and personal act of Jesus Christ, to
be observed in his church unto the end of the
world.
That God Justified men by imivutinK the
obedience and satisfaction of Christ to them.
they receiving- and resting upon him in all his
righteousness by faith, which faith they receive
) as the rift o? God.
It is only the last of these statements
that Professor McGiffert accepts as it
stands. *
The committee to whom the matter
was referred was composed of Rev. Dr.
Robert F. Sample (chairman). Rev. Dr.
John B. .Shaw. Rev. Dr. R. R. Booth and
Rev. Dr. John C. Bliss, and the follow
ing elders: William Magee, Oscar E.
Boyd and Titus B. Meigs.
Mr. Boyd was the only onÂ© of the com
mittee absent at a meeting of the com
mittee held just previous to the meet
ing of the presbytery.
The report was voluminous. â  Its es
sence was that the case should be re
ferred to the general assembly, which
meets in St. Louis next May. The re
port was accepted and ordered to be
1 printed for private distribution among
â  the members of the presbytery and made
the order of the day at the December
: meeting.
At the conclusion of the reading of the
report Professor Francis Hrown. Dr.
Howard Agnew Johnson and Her. Dr.
Henry Van Dyke read suggestions in
j which it was advised that the controver
sy over Professor MeGiffert be dropped.
Dr. Johnson's paper was heard first,
then Professor Brown's and Dr. Van
j Dyke's and they were in substance alike.
Dr. Van Dyke said that while a major
ity did not agree with Professor M -
i Giffert the wisdom of a heresy .rial was
i doubtful and might result in harm to
; the Presbyterian cause. In view of pre
! parations for a series of Presbyterian
; revivals in this city this fall and winter
the postponement of the discussion on
1 the subject and the reference to the gen
eral assembly is thought desirable.

FORMER BANKER ON
TRIAL FOR FORGERY
Abram King Charged With Having
Also Embezzled From an Estate
in His Charge.
SAX JOSE. Nov. Aged Abram King,
capitalist and ex-banker, was placed on
trial in Judge Lorigans- court to-day on
a charge of forgery. 'While guardian of
the estate of Stephen Hobson, an incom
petent. King is charged with having
robbed the estate. The Gxand Jury a year
ago returned six indictments of forgery
and one of perjury against King, who is
nearly SO years of age. The method of
looting the Hobson estate was systematic
and extended over a - period of many
years. Bills for clothing. and water and
repairs to property were .raised a dollar
or two. and in some instances King forged
claims against the estate until he had em
bezzled thousands of dollars.
The charge on which King is being tried
is for forging the name of L. W. Otter
to a bill for $36 that he charged to the
estate for plumbing. Most of the day
was occupied in securing a jury and
the testimony taken was of minor import
ance. King has made every effort to
settle the cases out of court, but without
avail. He was sued for $13,000 he had
embezzled from the estate by Mrs. Louise
Krouse. and this he settled in cash. He
is reputed to be worth a couple of hun
dred thousand dollars, and until the dis
covery of the peculations in the Hobson
estate was considered an honorable man.
He had served the county as Supervisor
and held other positions of trust. For
many years he was president of the First
National Bank.

To - Mcrrow Night in
Woodward^ Pavilion.
"Jack" Root. of Chicago and Alex Greg
gains, the pride of the south side, will
meet In the Woodwards Pavilion arena
to-morrow night in a twenty -round box
ing bout. Greggalns is a well-known- fig
ure among the sportsmen of this
while .Root is a stranger here. That his
reputation as a boxer preceded hini is evi
denced by the fact that he has been ln.-
Btalled a warm favorite in the betting;.
Ten to 6 was the price yesterday at Harry
Corbett's, with plenty of money offered by
the admirers of Root.
Root's following is chiefly among the
Eastern horsemen who have seen him
perform repeatedly and fancy his chances
against his opponent, lie will be at a
disadvantage In height, weight end reach,
but the disparity between the men is not
sufficiently marked to affect the outcome.
The Chicagoan Is 5 feet 10$ i inches in
height ana will scale 158 pounds in the
ring to-morrow night. He is in the best

possible condition, but will not have any
advantage over Greggalns on that score:
Rout trained at Cralls' Garden, Alameda,
and has been on the road every morning,
no .matter what the weather conditions
may have beÂ«n. In the afternoon he has
worked in the gymnasium with his
trainer, Fred Steiner, and with "Jack"
Weedy of Denver.
He has done no boxing for some days
past, as he did not want to risk injuring
his hands. He worked off his superfluous
energy on the punching bag, his blows rer
sounding for some distance.
Out of twenty-two ring engagements
Root has knocked out -sixteen of bis op
ponents and secured the decision in five
other bouts. Among his opponents have
been "Jack" Moffat, â¢'Tom" Lansing,
"â Jim" Watts-. "Jack" Murphy, Australian
"Jimmy" Ryan, Harry Peppers. "Billy"
Stlft and the Harlem Coffee Cooler.
Althuugh Greg-gains has not been in the
ring for some time, he has not lacked
practice. He boxes in the gymnasium of
the San Francisco Athletic Club nearly
every day in the year with a variety of
men. To finish his preparation properly
he has spent ten days at Blanken's Six
Mile House, where all the facilities re
quired in training are available. .
The preliminaries promise some good
boxing. Fred Ast will try conclusions
with "Jack" Weedy of Denver. The lat
ter is not a clever boxer, but he is strong
and willing, and can take a lot of punish
ment. From Asts earlier fights he should
be able to administer considerable punish
ment. The other brace of boxers Is made
up of "Jack" Ennts and Toby Irwin.
Greggalns and Root met last night in
Manager lamik'u resort for the purpose
of choosing a refefee for their contest,
which will be held to-morrow evening. A
number of w> 11 -known sporting men were
mentioned, but no selection was made. On

arriving at the place of meeting the pu
gilists "sized" eath o.ther up,- and after
shaking hands each remarked that the
other looke<l well, on coming down to
business Hiram -Cook's naxne was men
id not find favor in Greg
gains'- eyes, and in turn Alec .said that
"Jim" McDonald, the baseball' umpire,
would suit him, but Root balked. Phil
Wand and other experts were mentioned,
but neither man could agre.;. "Big Hill"
Lange, the well-known baseball player,
was suggested, and Greggains said he
would be satisfied if he were -chosen. Root
declared that he would nqt .express his
opinion on Lange until ho had telegraph
ed his managi r. Lou Houseman, the well
known s^ortiiiK writer. Manager Long
grew tired ; of the discussion anÂ£ pointedly I
told the men that he was in the habit of
pulling off "goes" on time and' that if
they had not agreed . on a referee on the
night, of the contest he would take off his
coat, get into the ring andreferee it him
self. Sportijig men In general would be
pleased if Long : would carry out this
threat, as they have the utmost confidence
in him.
Harry Corbett, the poolselW, will leave

trip is purely for pleasure and he will see
all there is to be soon in the line of sports
during his absence.

MERCED IS
THE MECCA
OF LEASHMEN
i hirty-TwoDog Stake for the
Interstate Coursing Club's
Annual Meeting.
A large party of coursing men will
leave here this morning for Merced for
the annual open meeting of the Interstate
Coursing Club. The stake closed with
thirty-two entries as against forty-four
last year. This falling off. in view of the
large number of dogs in training, is ac
counted for on the ground that owners
have increased - opportunities for running
their greyhounds for valuable purses In
the three parks now in operation in and
near this city. . - "â  f
The quality of the entries is high class,
although few men care to trust valuable
dogs in. thÂ© open plains where they may
run- until permanently injured. The ma
jority of the coursing men will leave here
this, morning on the 9 o'clock train.
Coursing will be commenced to-morrow
and concluded on Thursday. The draw

PERPETRATORS ARE KNOWN
CROTON OIL POURED IN THE
COFFEE.
The Conspirators to Be Arrested To-
Dayâ Will Be Sent Over to Al
catraz Island to
Repent.
The members of Company X, Forty
second R-giment, were not poisoned by
diseased beef as many were inclined to
believe) but were the victims of what two
cf their comrades, who were guilty of the
outrage, thought was a "good joke."
Anxious to have â  me "fun" with their
fellow-soldiers two privates of Company
X, whose names the military authorities
at present refuse to divulge! conceived the
diabolical scheme of placing croton oil In
the coffee" "just to see how -.; would act
on them," as one of the men expressed it.
Friday evening two soldiers, who are
under suspicion as being the perpetrators
of tho outrage, visited a drug store at
Clay and Fillmore streets and asked for
an "ounce bottle of croton oil. . â  .irug
gist. suspecting something wrong, refused
to serve them. The soldiers at once left
the place and visited several other drug
stores in the immediate vicinity, but
without succeeding In purchasing the
oil It is known that they subsequently
boardtd a downtown car and alighted
at California and Dupout streets. < \olng
to a drug store in the tenderloin district
they had little trouble in purchasing a
sufficient quantity of the deadly oil. To
several friends they exhibited the vial of
oil and unfolded their scheme to "job"
their regiment. Alter returning to the
l'residio they discussed the, most feasible
plan to administer the oil to their com
rades and finally agreed to place it in the
coffee. Just before the morning mess was
served the conspirators stealthily entered
the kitchen, and while one of them en
gaged the cook in conversation the other
dumped the contents of the ounce bottle
Into the coffee-pot. A few minutes later
breakfast was served, together with the
poisoned coffee. Those who had partaken
of the drugged coffee a short time after
ward were seized with violent cramps and
fits of nausea. Altogether sixty non
commissioned officers and privates were
made sick by drinking the coffee. They
were, hurried to the post hospital and
were first treated for strychnine poison
ing. Gradually it dawned upon the
doctors that the unfortunate soldiers had
partaken of coffee dosed with croton oil,
and they so notified the commanding
cilicer. "He ordered a thorough investiga
tion and threatened to have the perpe
trators of the cruel outrage court-mar
tialed. Yesterday the officers who were
commissioned to inquire into the poison-
Ing of the member? of the Forty-second
Regiment visited several drug stores in
the Western Addition in the hope of ob
taining at least a description of the
Fnldiers who wanted to buy croton oil.
They afterward visited the drug stores in
the tendrrlni;i district and succeeded in
learning in what store the deadly oil was
lioutrht. To-day the two men will be for
mally eharerpd with the crime and taken
before a court-martial. The officers of
the regiment have no hesitancy in saying
that if they are convicted' they are
doomed to long imprisonment at Alcatraz.
The soldiers who were poisoned are all
out of danger and will recover. They are
very hitter against the men who perpe
trated th^- so-callr-d jnkr. and threaten to
make it very Interesting for them when
their identity is made known.

EIGHT THOUSAND MEN
REVIEWED BY MILES
Reviewing Officers Saluting the Colors of the Forty-Fourth.
IT was worth the risk of rain to go'
out to the Presidio hills yesterday
morning to -the review. There has
been nothing like it in the mili
tary history of the coast, and It will
be long before such a force of men
under arms will be seen here again.
Eight thousand men marched past
the commanding general; seven bands
thrilled the air with their most mar
tial music and guns thundered forth
their boisterous welcome to the chief
of chiefs.
Where on other days the peaceful
golf player wields his "welties" was
yesterday marked off by guidons and
patrolled by cavalrymen from the
time the first spectator arrived until
the field was in possession of the
troops. They made a formidable ar
ray. The line was long and deep,
stretching from the beginning of the
rise up over the hill and down on
the other side until the horses of the
light batters were hidden from view.
The line faced almost east and back
from its front, rank upon .rank,
twelve companies deep, the regi
ments were formed-. The companies
stood ejose, but even then the last of
each regiment was far down in the
hollow. It was as close a formation
as the tactics allow, but close as It
was the troops seemed to fill the hill
side.
On the right was the first battalion
of the Third Artillery, regular troops,
under command of Colonel Rawles.
Then on up over the hill were the
Fortieth, under Colonel Godwin; the
Forty-fourth, under Colonel McCler
i.and; the Thirty-eighth, under Colo
nel Anderson; the Forty-sixth, under
Colonel Schuyler; the Forty-fifth, un
der Colonel Dorst; the Forty-second,
under Lieutenant Colonel Beacon,
and Light Battery C of the Third Ar
tillery, under Captain Califf. The
regiments were drawn up side by
Bide and as close together as possible,
each company dressed on its neigh
bors to the fraction of a foot. In
front Colonel 11. B. Freeman of the
Twenty-fourth infantry waited with
his big command the coming of the
reviewing officers.
General Shafter came first, rollowed
by his staff, and thinking It was Gen
eral Miles Captain Callfl got to work
and soon the crest of the hill was
plumed with smoke and tongues of
flame and the field guns were play
ing a riotous tune. It was not until
BRUTAL CONDUCT
OF A DRUNKEN
PROVOST GUARD
Jabs a Soldier With
His Bayonet.
J. H. Willis, a soldier at the Presidio,
caused a sensation on Market street, be
tween Ellis and Powell, yesterday
morning, ami about 300 indignant citizens
who saw hifl brutal conduct wanted to
lyncli him.
Willis claims that he is a member of
Battery B. Third Artillery, and was or
dered yesterday morning to go downtown
and round up members of the Forty
sixth Infantry, as they were all to he on

THE SAN FBANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 14, 1899.
the full salute of fifteen was finished
that It was learned General Miles had
still to come, so the guns were left
unlimbered, and when he did arrive
they brukf forth again. That' is why
i he commanding general was saluted
twice.
General Miles- rode out before the
center of the column; and .then Free
man, bringing- his ponderous command
to a present, tendered the review to
General Miles.
The first business of the' reviewing
officer and his aids and attendants was
to ride around the command, starting
at the right front, up the front and
ove.r the hill to the left flank, down
the left flank, back again. behind the
line and '.to the right front ; again.
There' was General Miles ana his aid.,
colonel Michler; General Shafter, his
aid, Major Wilson, and his staff, com
â¢ Adjutant General Babcoc.k,
Colonel Forwood, chief surgeon; Lieu
tenanl Colonel Marion P. M-uis, in-
Bpector general; Major H. J. Gal
la commissary; Major Groeshaek,
â advocate, and Captain Frank'
..â¢'. signal officer, and Colonel
â Freeman, commanding the review, his
aid. Lieutenant Eltinge, and his staff,
composed of Lieutenant McNair, act
int; adjutant general, and Captain
Kimball, assistant quartermaster,, and
also General .BrecklnrldKe. Inspector
i of the army. Besides these â  Â©#-
fleers there was a squad - of orderlies,
and all together they made an impos
ing body of horsemen.
TL inspection over, the reviewing
officers took their places; Colonel Free
man and his staff rode to the head of
the column and the review- started.
Miles is a sol, Her from, his choice of
a horse to his choice of a cap. He rode
nut in front of his officers, as befitting
.1 commander, and waited for the col
umn, raisins his cap as Freeman rode
past, and then joined the line of of
ficers just behind- him. In the group
were, besides the commander and
Freeman, Mak>r General Shafter and
Major General Brerkinridge. Then, as
each regiment arrived at the review
ing stand, its colonel rode out and
made a fifth.
The column seemed endless. Com
pany front, it marched past with a
regularity that would have done credit
to an eight-day clock, each regimental
turning out of column to play
while its regiment passed, and then
giving place to the succeeding one.
For an hour the men marched on, un
much for them, and if it had not been for
the opportune appearance of Policeman
George Douglass Willis would have met
with rough treatment.
Douglass, by strategy, succeeded in ob
taining -ion of Willis' rifle and
bayonet and belt of cartridges, and then
ordered the three soldiers to march in
front of. him to the patrol box at Powell
and Eddy streets, where lie rang in for
the patrol wagon. There were cries of
"Lynch him," but Willis rlur..-; to the po-
Uceman and was saved fpini .'unishment.
Taylor was taken to the Receiving Hos
pital", where three stab wounds In his
shoulder and arm and under his arm pit
were stitched and dressed. He and Hor
ton were detained In the City Prison fill
taken to the Presidio, and a charge- of
drunk was booked against Willis. Cap
tain Seymour notified the authorities at
thfÂ» Presidio as soon as the men were
taken to the prison.

til the swing, of their feet became a
mental irritation. The ground was
soft and the footing was good, and the
company line that had a crook in it
was poof indeed. Tt -was the same
thing, men and men and men, until
the wonder was who were left to fill
the watching crowds.
Last in the column was the light
battery. Its black horses and scarlet
saddle. blankets. always look well, and
they, looked the better yesterday for
the number of foot troops that had
marched before them. The light bat
tery ended the parade, and by the time
it had passed most of the column had
made. its way back to the post.
'Afterthe review General Miles, Mrs.
Miles and Miss Miles, and General
Shatter, were the guests of Colonel
Freeman at luncheon, and during the
â afternoon there was a reception to
them at Colonel Freeman's house at
the Presidio, to which all the officers
and ladies of the post were bidden.
It was- at first intended that the
Forty-sixth Regiment should not
take part in the parade, but Instead
should march to the transport dock
and embark for Manila, but at the
last moment it was decided that it,
too, should be made part of the re
view, as it would in any event hive
to wait until to-day for the Forty
fifth, whi^h is billed to sail at the
same- time.

DEWEY OPPOSED
TO EXCLUSION
Favors Chinese Admis
sion to Philippines.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 13.â Whether Chi
nese exclusion should be applied to the
Philippines is among the subjects engag
ing the attention of the Philippine Com
mission. Considerable evidence bearing
on the matter has been collected and be
sides presenting this testimony with their
full report, it is expected that a recom
mendation will have considerable influ
ence in shaping the course of this Gov
ernment and the action of Congress. It is
understood that two members of the com
missionâMessrs. Denby and Worcester
have expressed themselves as favorable
to an application of the Chinese exclu
sion act to the Philippines. From the
fact that General Otis has issued an or
der for Chinese exclusion, it is asserted
that his voice as a member of the com
mission also would be Tor Chinese exclu
sion in the Philippines.
The position of Admiral Dewey, how
ever, is understood to be favorable to Chi
nese admission. While this personal view
of the admiral has been expressed to
friends, it is not known whether he would
give tt offlcfe.l expression in case all his
colleagues on the commission favored a
recommendation of exclusion. The atti
tude of President Schurman has not been
made known even in an informal way.
The exclusion question is involved to
some extent with the inquiries which the
Lnited Slates is now making of other
powers as to the maintenance of an open
door policy in China.
It was stated to-day in an authoritative
diplomatic quarter that in case the United
States adopts a permanent policy of Chi
nese exclusion in. the Philippines there is
llttre doubt such a course would cause
China to be less friendly in her co-ope
ration with the plans of the United States
to extend our trade in the empire.
DEWEY NOT ANNOYED
BY GOTHAM CROWDS
NEW YORK, Nov. 13.â Admiral Dewey
and wife breakfasted to-day at S:3O
o'clock ;n their apartments at the Wal
dorf-Astoria and two hours later left the
hotel for a walk. In compliance with the
request made by the admiral on Satur
day he was not molested in any way and
the enthusiastic persons who recognized
him on Fifth avenue contented tliom
selves with saluting: and passing on. The
admiral leturned all salutes by raising
his hat and Mrs. Dewey bowed. The
couple walked up Fifth avenue to the
Plaza and through Central Park to Six
ty-fourth r.treet. At that point they
were confronted by a group of nurse
girls and tneir charges and turned back,
leaving the park by the Sixth avenue en
trance.

CALIFORNIA IRRIGATION.
\ A R. ET.WOOD MEAD, in charge of the Irri-.

* * ment, who will attend the water storage con
tioq in this city, in an interview for The Call has
.1 the irrigation situation in this State very
: dearly, and has given the reason For California's great
interest in the subject He said: "There is no ques
; tion as to the fact that water is worth more in Cali
fornia than in any other State in the Union."
The value of water for irrigation is tixed by the
I value of what it will produce. Where the climate is fa
vorable to a very great variety of products of the soil,
and to an almost constant succession of crops, agri
ire in all its branches is the most profitable and
its products ire the most valuable.
We have these conditions. The long, arid and hot
. which is peculiar to the whole interior of the
State, from it.s north line to its southern border, pre
sents conditions favorable to the best u-e of irriga
tion. When the supply and distribufton of water are
adequate we will have even more constant use of thÂ«
land than now, fur the early grain harvest will per
mit the use of the land for another crop of roots,
fodder plants or other useful and valuable products.
Where land is now in alfalfa under our all-compelling
sunshine five or six crops may be cut in a season.
Where sugar beets are raised their harvest may be fol
lowed immediately by something else, and the land
may be kept in continual action.
These favorable conditions, dependent on climate,
i are not present in the arid States whose lands lie at
such an altitude as to make a short season, and where
i the production of more than one crop is impossible.
All of this runs back to the cost of water storage and
ibution. Where only one crop can he raised,
the climate' is not friendly to a great variet]
rultural products, the cost of securing a water
-â¢apply is regulated by those conditions. The value of \
] the water per annum is the value of the one, or at
best two. crops it will produce in a year. Here its |
i value is that of the many and the Kreat variety of
I crops permitted by our climate. This i- a dominating
principle that should not he lost sight of by the con
vention. If water in California produces an orange
| crop worth a thousand dollars an acre, it is that much
! more valuable than water in Nevada, Wyoming or
. Idaho used at an average elevation of 4000 feet, where
j the short season permits only one field crop worth
r $30 an acre. If used here on alfalfa, producing
six crops in a year, it is -i\ limes as valuable as i
where only orfe 'Top can be grown,

value of water, to I that may be incurred in
obtaining it, and are the measure of the annual

But there is another fad I Si I
Our output â  depends also upon a constant
supply of water for use in mining. It is needed not
only for flowing the crushed quart/ but for
in running r, >, trams Fi r electric lighting.
If for I iter our mines are idle half the year
and pi half time i 00, <>n ful
they will produce $40,000,000. It i* true that in small
areas in other mineral ie rela

great and important as here. Therefore I â¢
purposes water i- more valuable in California than in
any other State in 1 Union, and this value 1

A HOLIDAY SUGGESTION.
UPON publication of th< ( the War De
partment instructing the â  . general
to forward \r>-c of cliarge From San Francisco
all boxes of Christmas presents which may arrive
here prior to November 20 f< r officers and sold
in the Philippines,, some of our Eastern contempo
raries at once pointed out to the expi
tlrat they could make a "great hit" by agreein
transport the boxes free of charge to this city.
What lias been the effect of the hint upon the
express companies of the East we have not heard.
As a rule express companies do not try to make
that kind of a hit at the public. Their aim is at the
public purse and they count nothing a hit that does
not touch it. The chances are that so far from carry
ing Christmas gifts for the men at the front fre<
charge, they have not even consented to pay the
tax !>y affixing stamps on the receipts they jjive to
the shippers.
Whatever may have been its effect in the East, the
suggestion is a.K' )( 'd one. It has a holiday liberality
and wholesome Christmas cheerfulness about it. and
therefore we recommend it to the attention of the
Wells-Fargo Company. Between now and the 20th
of the month there is ample time for a good many
Christmas presents to be sent from Pacific Coasr
points to San Francisco to be forwarded to the sol
dier?. The express company people, while scorning
to pay war taxes, are not averse to being known as
philanthropists. Doubtless, they would also like to
be known as patriots. The number of presents sen!
to Manila will not be very larj 1 ill their weight
considerable. Here then is an opportunity for the.
express com]. any to 'â¢how that it not just in all things
it can at least be generous in some things.
We repeat the suggestion of our Eastern contem
poraries, therefore, with our cordial indorsement,
having no doubt it will be received by the express
managers in California in the same spirit with which
it was received in the East
The failure to obtain a representative of the Pacific
Coast on the Interstate Commerce Commission this
time should not lead us to abandon the struggle.
Then.- will be another vacancy befora long, and we
uld be prepared to make a fight for it when the
time comes.
GOVERNMENT AND SYNDICATES.
YESTERDAY there came from the East two
dispatches, each important in itself, but made
doubly important by reason of the relation
the one bears to the other, and both to the problem
of governmental supervision of great combinations of
capita] engaged in controlling industries which affect
the welfare of the whole people.
One of these dispatches came from St. Louis and
announced the preparations which have been made by
St. Louis, Chicago and other lar^e cities of the Mis
sissippi Valley to procure from the Interstate Com
merce Commission a regulation of freight rates which
would advance the interest-, of those Â« it : cs ai the ex
pense of the rights of the States of both the Pacific
and the Atlantic seaboard. The other came from
Xew York and announced that certain large capital
ista of that city have combined with the Harriman-
Gould syndicate to consolidate the leading trunk

lines of the United States. The scope of the plan
i is said to be not one of traffic alliance merely, but
I the union of the lines under one ownership in a de
! tennined effort to uphold traffic rates independent of
j the Interstate Commerce Commission.
In these days of great syndicates it is not improb
, able that some men more enterprising than the rest
i have devised the .vast combination outlined in the
New York dispatch. Railway combinations have
I been a common thing in American history for many
i years past. All the great transcontinental lines' have
I been built up by such consolidations of roads which
were once under independent management. The new
movement, therefore, when started, will be but an
outgrowth of the past and a step in the natural order
of development. It is not going to be easily achieved,
however, and, even if now under way, a long time will
elapse before it will be accomplished.
The most interesting feature of the report is thr-t
thÂ« scheme has been devised with the intention of
upholding freight rates independent of the Interstate
imerce Commission. That means that while
Chicago and St. Louis are seeking to gain advantage
j through the officials of the Government, New York
will endeavor to obtain advantage for herself by get
| ting possession of the trunk lines and fixing "rates
according to her interests. Should the scheme be
carried out the conflict between the Government and
I the syndicates would be openly begun, and so long
i as it continued the lawyer with a railway practice
! would have a bigger bonanza than ever will be found
in the Klondike.
Fortunately there is no immediate prospect of any
such conflict. The Interstate Commerce Commission
can be relied upon to guard the interest of all por
tions of the Union, and is not likely to be subservient
to. the greed of Chicago and St. Louis. The only
likely to suffer is the Pacific Coast, and what
rgay be done us will be due to the lack of a
Pacific Coast representative on the commission to
explain the needs of the coast and uphold them.
A recent church row in Kansas reveals the exist
ence in that State of a set of people who call them
selves "Truth Knowers," and also 'that their neigh
bors think they do not know enough about the truth
to tell it even when speaking of themselves.
A DISPATCH from Berlin yesterday states that
the Prussian Minister of Finance has had a
long conference with the Emperor concerning
the efforts of Russia to raise another loan in Ger-
many. It was added that the desire of the Russians
for a new loan is clue to the discovery that the Si
berian railway will cost far more than was estimated,
and that a financial crash in Russia is feared by the
financiers of Europe.
The statements of the dispatch are in line with re
ports th.it have been in circulation for some time, hut
there is reason â¢." believe the situation in Russia is
not so bad as they represent it. That the Siberian
railway will cost much more than the sum originally
estimated i- now well known, but our Consuls in Rus
sia have reported that the additional cost will be due
f " improvements and extensions made upon the plans
adopted for the road when it was first projected.
< Originally the road was designed to In- hardly more
than a military railway. It was not expected that any
i -able traffic would be carried on over it, and
accordingly the roadbed was not strongly built, light
rails were put down ami comparatively slight bridges
were constructed. With, the extension of the line,
however, there has come a rapid increase of the com
mercial demands upon it. and it has been found neces
sary to go over nearly the whole line and strengthen
it in every way. If the<e reports be true the increase
in the cost of the road does not imply a loss to the
Government, but a Rain. It is true the immediate
liture of money will be larger than was ex
pected, but eventually the enterprise will be more
profitable than it would have been otherwise.
If the f< financial crash in Russia have no
indation than the reported increase in the
cost of the Siberian road they are hot likely to be
realized. It is to be borne in mind that predictions oi
.1 coming crash arc heard at this time in every coun
try. It lias been repeatedly said that the vast specu
lative boom in trust companies in New York will lead
to a crash in the United States. Similar predictions
based on similar grounds have been heard in London,
in Paris and in Berlin, ior in all those great cen
ters of commercial and financial activity there has
been extensive speculation in securities of one kind or
another. All experience shows that every era of
â¢ has led to over-speculation, and that in
turn has brought about a crash of some kind. To
that extent, therefore, the predictions of coming dis- ,
aster are reasonable, but there is no apparent cause,
why the crash should be feared in Russia any moot
than elsewhere.
As a matter of. fact there is at this time a strin
gency in financial circles everywhere. It is felt in
Europe and in New York. In no place, howewr, is
it of a nature to alarm any but the pessimists who
always see the gloomy side, of things and the bear
specvlators whose interests incline them to exag
gerate everything which would have a tendency to
cause a fall in the prices of stocks. Russia may have
some difficulty in placing a large loan just at this
time, but it is not likely that work will be stopped on
the Siberian railroad or that the empire will be bank
ruin.
Every nation on earth, apparently, is aping rhe.,
Americans. Only the other day a detachment of our
army in the Philippines captured several hundred
thousand pounds of (lour, rice and salt, and right fon
| top of this feat comes the announcement that the
Boers have captured a poultry-yard.

LANE AND JENKINS.
Special Revenue Agent Thomas Will
Keep His Eye Upon the Pair.
Revenue Agent Thomas announced yes
terday that ha would prosecute Freeman
P. Lane and P. G. Jenkins whenever He
shall have obtained sufficient evidence
that I hoy are passing themselves off as
revenue officers.
When Lane and Jenkins presented
'themselves at the establishment of.
Lemle, Levy & Co., 261 Third street, last
week, Messrs. Lemle & Levy allowed
them to Inspect their stock of liquors,
they say, upon the representation of Lane
thai he was a special agent and upon
Jenkins exhibiting upon the bosom of his
vest a badge engraved with the words
"internal revenue officer." They stated
positively to Mr. Thomafl that Jenkins ex
hibited such a badge. Jenkins denied to
Mr Thomas that fie had such a badge,
and asserted thai he wore a badge with
the words "Chronicle reporter."
There is another Levy next door :ii 259
i Third Btreet, who is in business for him
sell and who is not connected with the
i firm in any way. It was not in his place
thai the bogus imported cordials were
! found, but in the store of I>emle, Levy &
rjs.
Mr. Thomas has no proof that Lane
represented himself to be a special agent
of the revenue department except by
Implication, persons not distinguishing
between "special agent" and special
agent of the treasury or of the revenue.
But a strict watch will be kept on the
pair hereafter on that line, Mr. Thomas
Bays.

Regiment, United States _ Volunteers,
named Thomas Williams, bought a pair
of shoes in \V. 11. Nolan's shoe store yes
terday afternoon and tendered in pay
â  ment a $50 bill. Something in the appear
ance of the bill attracted the suspicion

he sent it to Cashier Burns of the United

nounced it a counterfeit Williams was
detained and Secret Service Agent Hazen
was sent for and arrested the soldier. The
prisoner said that the bill had been given
i to him by a mar. named Ira Moss, and
that Moss had previously approached two
other soldiers and tried to get them to
pass the counterfeit money.
Hazen took the soldier 'with him, and
they succeeded in finding Moss. The pris
oner was taken to the California-street
Btation and afterward transferred to the
City Prison and placed In the tanks sub

Moss is about 33 years old. and has been
engaged recently in selling- custom-made

CRUSADE AGAINST THE
TELEPHONE MONOPOLY
Supervisors Take the First
Steps to Tax Nickel-in*
the=S!ot Attachments.
A Handsome Yearly Revenue
Will Accrue to t\n City
Through the Proposed Meas
ure of the Board.
THE Board of Supervisors has taken
the first Btep toward forcing the tele
phone company to contribute some
thing of its enormous proflta to the
city. The telephone monopoly is en
joying- tremendous privileges in San
Francisco. It receives for nothing exelu
'ights which legitimately ought to
return to the municipality a handsome
yearly revenue. It escapes, just taxation
and uses its advantages to abuse the
rights of the people. The gigantic evil of
tlii.- condition of affairs has been pointed
out by the Mayor and Assessor and now
the Supervisors, through a resolution in
troduced yesterday by Supervisor Aig-el
tinger, intend to remedy the injustice at
i'.ist in a measure.
The resolution, winch was presented at
the meeting of thi board yesterday and
which is now on its road toward adoption.
lea that a quarterly tax of $1 shall j
' upon every telephone in the
City which has a nickel in the slot at
tachment. Further than this the tele
phone company la commanded to submit
a truthful statement of the number of
such telephor.es In use. This measure,
which is the result of emphatic public
agitation, will force the gigantic corpora
tion to pay a closer proportion at least of
its just taxes.
The nickcl-in-the-slot telephone as It
( xists in this city has been a gross and
Insolent imposition upon the public and a
source of tremendous revenue to the-tele
phon< â¢ jr. Many thousands of
these telephones are in use in homes,
business houses and all sorts of local es
tablishments. By extensive advertising
and judicious representations the tele
phone monopoly ha^ developed its scheme
ible revenue. Arbitrary prices have
been placed upon the telephones and !
n forced to submit to the :
ns. They have paid and are now !
grossly exorbitant price for the I
loan -if each telephone and then pay an '
j addition;; 1 sum for its use.
Even In This feature of the fraud upon
the public the monopoly has shown dis
crimination. For what purports to be the
same service some patrons have to pay
a certain price and more favored people
have to pay a smaller one. Merchants
j have been made victims of a necessity,
1 bur they dare not complain. When they
secure their telephones and pay for them
an outrageously high price, they cannot
use them without paying live cents for
each switch.
Under even worse conditions thousands
of these nickel-in-the-slot telephones have
been Introduced in residences, where they
remain an expensive and useless luxury.
It would seem that the local monopoly
would ha ye be< n ml eni to k r i . â¢
Bervice for Its enormous profit trum i
nlckel-in-tlv-sl"f devices, but the
agreeable experiences of thousands of
people prove that it has not been. The
service rendered through the system is
notoriously insolent and a sham. The
telephone company has simply used its
devices to descend to petty larceny. It !s
able that the number of instances in
which people pay a nickel and r-- eive no
service aggregate many thousands every
day. Th< agents of the company have
their Instructions to exact a flve-ceni
piece before they learn whether or not
a desired switch may be obtained if tne
line be busy or out of order, or If
tral" be in an unamiable mood, no switch
is obtained. Another five-cent piece has j

MJPERVL-OR AIGELTINGER.
I gone to the monopoly and the customer
grumbles his anger.
This petty very has become a public
nuisance, but the monopoly is supremely
unconcerned. An instance of these in-
I numerable outrages will be remembered
I in the case of the Mission butcher who
smashed a telephone and its nickel-in-the- I
slot attachment. He had tried in vain
to obtain a certain switch. He had in
each Instance submitted to "central's" de
mand to "drop a nickel." He finally be
came exasperated and refused to pay any
more. He was told that he could not have
the desired switch. He justly retaliated
| by smashing the telephone and appropri
; ating the money he had paid.
Thousands of similar injustices have
been committed, but no redress has been
given. The monopoly is thriving in its
ill-gotten profit, and now the Supervisors
have determined that some of this money
shall come back to the municipality. The j
proposed order which Supervisor Aigel- ;
tinger introduced yesterday is in full as j
follows:
An order for the purpose of regulating and
Imposing a license for the purpose of revenue
upon any person, firm or corporation carrying
on or conducting in the city and county of
San Francisco the business of telephone ser
vice and the use of slot devices therein.
The people if the city and county of San ;
Francisco do ordain as follows:
Section 1. Any person, firm or corporation
carrying on '"" conducting any business, oc
cupation, service or employment hereinafter
specified shall pay license as hereinafter pro
vided.
Section 2. Any person, firm or corporation
carrying on or conducting In the city and
county of San Francisco the business of fur
nishing telephone service to any person, per
sons, firm, firms, corporation, subscriber or i
subscriber* and furnishing with telephones for j
use In such service any slot-box or other I
device for the purpose of collecting money or ;
other representative or money value, shall pay
a licence in the sum Of one dollar ($1 00) per
quarter to the city and county r( San Fran- !
cisco for each such slot-box or other device
so used.
tlon 3. Every such . person, firm or cor- ]
poration mentioned In section 2 of this order
shnll ninke or cause to be made to the pen
authorized to collect licenses for the city an.l
county Of San Fnneisco once in every quarter
a statement verified by the oath of such per
son, member of such firm, or general manager ;
of such corporation as to the number of such
slnt-boxfs or other devices of like nature so
used. The first statement to be so made shall I
be made within tei. days after the passage and
adoption of this ordinal â 
Section 4 Every person falling to make thÂ»
statement' mentioned in section 3 of this ordi
nance shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.
The foregoing order was passed to print â 
by a unanimous vote of the board. In
speaking of the matter last night Super
visor Algfltinger said: .
"I introduced the order because T be
lieve thai the telephone company should
contribute its just proportion of taxes. It
has escaped hitherto and under the char
tor has received more than fair treatment.
By placing a quarterly tax of $1 on nickel
in-tne-slot telephones the city will reap
a yearly revenue of between" $20,000 and !
$30,000. If it is possible I intend also to
force the company to give the people of '
the city an honest service. The Imposi
tion which now nets the company an
enormous sum is outrageous. It is noth- ;
Ing less than robbery and the employes
of the company should be made guilty of
a misdemeanor if they accept a nickel I
without first giving the switch for which :
a nickel is paid."
AFTERMATH IN THE
REPUBLICAN CAMP
CAMPAIGN MONEY RECEIVED
AND DISBURSED.
Alfred Bouvier, Refreshed by Rest in
the Country, Presided at the
Meeting of the Execu
tive Committee.
The executive committee of the Repub- !
lican County Committee met at the Bald
win Annex last night and considered \
campaign expenses. Alfred. Bouvier.
somewhat refreshed by a brief season of
much-needed rest in the country, pre
sided.
The committee talked of campaign ex
penses, and the discussion disclosed the
fact that the balance of cash in the
hands of the purity committee would
probably be sufficient to liquidate the out
standing obligations of the committee.
J. H. McCarthy desired that a public
statement should be made of all the
money received and the sources from
which it came and how it was expended.
A. â B. Truman, chairman of the cam
paign committee, moved that an itemized
statement be filed of all money re
ceived and of every item of disbursement.
He did. not care what customs were ob
served in the past, but insisted that- a
clean sheet be presented to the public,]
showing every dollar received, the source
of the contribution and the voucher of :
disbursement.
Max Goldberg suggested thru the report
of finances should come from the purity
committee..
Mr. Bouvier explained that Mr. Hy
mans, chairman of the purity committee,
would soon have the report ready. There
Is a book showing every dollar received
and the vouchers properly numbered
showing the disbursement. '
Further discussion brought out the'
statement that all the bijls had not been
presented for payment, hence the purity
commiUce was not ready to report.
To enlighten the committee generally I
the statement was made by the chairman
of the campaign committee that the a.-.
sessment of candidates produced $4000 arid I
the sum of $1500 was received from other'
sources.
Max Goldberg, who controls a bank and
Is quick at figures, announced that $5500 1
was the sum total rei^eiyed and do one:
disputed lie mental calculation.
There will be a meeting of the RepubU- !
can County Committee Wednesday even
in?? of next week. A full accounting will
then be made. Vouchers may be inspect
ed and questions asked. I
A movement to displace from* '' tr>
County Committee John J. Curry of t^e
Forty-third Assembly District, occupied |
one hour of the executive cornnr ttee's
time. The subject was considered in se
cret session. The point was rate that 1
Mr. Curry was a Democrat and /nould be
removed, but the committee d<y>ided that
he was a Republican. It was und should
remain noted that the Forty-^riird District
was exceptionally strong in , its support of
the Republican ticket.

The suit instituted foy Colonel F. S.

bor Commission Vas dismissed yesterday

That the suit Vould be dismissed was an

were the inf^ aen ces which prompted Gov

suit. Jr
THERE MAY BE A
FIGHT FOR TWO
PLUMP OFFICES
Truman and Sheehan
to Coniest.
BOTH ALLEGE NON-RESIDENCE
CLAIM THEIR OPPONENTS ARIZ
INELIGIBLE.
Brooks Lived in San Rafael, Scott in
San Jose â Charter Requires a
Residence in This
County.
There is a possibility that Samuel H.
j Brooks, Democrat, will not take his seat
i in the County Treasurer's chair and mat
j Joseph H. Scott, Republican, will not
succeed Rd I. Sfaeehan as Tax Collector
iof this L-i t y and county. Both received
: a majority of votes oust at the last elec
tion, l.ut their respective titles to office
are to be < ontested bj the incumbei ;~
i upon the ground that they are ineligible
under the provision of the chartei i â 
quiring that office-holders shall have
been qualified electors of the city and
county for live successive years prlur to
election.
Mr. Brooks was a resident of this city
up to two years ago, when he movedover
to San Rafael and lived foi a year.
Scott is ,vi old-time resident of this city,
but several years ago moved to Pan J< Be,
where iie went Into business, and also
registered as a voter of Santa Clara
County. It is claimed he did not return
to this city unti! four and a half years
ag-o. just halt" a year too late to come
within the live-year requirement uf, the
charter.
Treasurer Truman makes no conceal
ment of his intention to fight Brooks if
he finds that the taw stands wit;. h:m.
it'- contends that in moving to dan Ra
fael Brooks sacrificed his domicile In this
city and became a bona ftde resident of
Marin County and that although he re
turned to this city a year -ago and again
made his lesidence here, he has not been
a resident fur live years in succession
and is. of a consequence, not compete n1
to hold office under the charter.
Brooks' case hinges solely on the ques
tion of whether or not he sacrificed his
residence in this city when he went over
to San Rafael I'nder the law an elector
has not lost his residence if he has re
mained in another city or county with
the intention of returning to his previous
domicile, unless he has become by regis
tration an elector of the county to which
he moved. Brooks' name does not appear
upon the grreat register of Marin County,
and It will devolve upon Treasurer Tru
man. If he contests, to prove that he actu
ally gave up his residence here and moved
to Pnn Rafael with no intention of re
turn in it.
Scott 8 ease presents more solid grounds
If the allegations made be true, In mov
ing to San Jose and signing the great
register he actually gave up his reaidenci
here and became a bona Ode resident of
that county. To oust him Tax Collector
Sheehan would have to prove that he has
not lived in and been a qualified elector
of this city and county for live successive
years since that time, and prior to the
day of his election. If the contention
th.it he has been her" for (our years and
a half it'.ivi- true, the charter students at
the City Hall claim he will be disquali
lird. and that Sheehan viii remain In his
present position until his successor is
elected mid duly Qualified, which will be
at the next general election.
Sheehan will not admit for publication
that he contemplates such action as set
forth, but he has threatened it in th<
presence of his intimates, and it is known
he is busy looki ng up legal points to
hack his case.
GOOD NEWS FOR FARMERS.

THE GREATEST NAME IN SPANISH ART.
Copyright, 1899, by Seymour Eaton. .
THE lA/ORLD'S GREAT ARTISTS.
IV. VELASQUEZ.
(Concluded.)
11.
It Is very seldom that a painter emerges
as Velasquez aid from the ranks of the
aristocracy, and still more seldom that
the aristocracy, when as exclusive as that
of Spain, should not repudiate but delight
to honor him as an equal. This gives an
unusual flavor to Velasquez's career.
With his handsome figure, in superb cos
tumes, crowned with honors and responsi
bilities, he appears as an embodiment of
tact arid refinement, a lover of the pleas
ures of court life. The royal favor and
the liberal patronage of the court made
it possible for him not only' to .be inde
pendent of the patronage of the church,
but to throw off the yoke of ecclesiastical
tyranny in art and dare to paint whatever
he chose. He was the only great secular
artist of Spain.
It is as well to frankly confess from tho
start the limitations and weaknesses of
Velasquez's art. He has no imagination or
pathos; he does not conceive types or ex
press emotions. His drawing is often
sadly defective and he seldom shows any
sense of the beauty of line. He often
composes weakly, and is crude â¢or ele
mentary in the management of acces
sories and backgrounds. He was very
slow in reaching mastery in his art and
his early work promised nothing remark- i
able.
On the other hand we admire him as a
QUEEN ISABELLA OF SPAIN.
(From a Painting by Velasquez.)
supremo realist, as a master of quiet ]
dramatic art, as the greatest painter of
atmosphere. He is a supreme realist be
cause, tempered by his surroundings, he
sloughed off all that was vulgar In his
earliest studies and gives us perfect
transcripts of the natural man. He is j
great as a dramatist because he poses his
I figures perfectly as if for stage rehearsal
and is able to give elan without mo- '
tion, the perfection of repressed vigor
without a trace of the drama of emotion.
And, finally, modern artists worship him !
as well nigh the greatest of old masters |
and the earliest of moderns most of all
because of his technical supremacy and â¢
mastery of atmospheric effects. He is un- !
equaled in giving solidity and planes to :
his figures and in placing them in an at
mosphere palpitating with reality, in dif
ferentiating between absorbing and re
flecting surfaces and in reproducing the I
exact values even in the most elaborate :
Interiors. Artists appreciate the difficulty !
i f even approaching such perfection from
afar, and even the uninitiated are gripped I
hard, without knowing why, by the ma- j
terial artistic truthfulness that the
technique expresses.
Velasquez made few preliminary
, sketches, as was customary with most
artists. He planned and studied but I
little before the actual beginning of his
final work. He appears to have posed or j
grouped his figures in a tableau and then
to have transferred them to canvas, with
the greatest realism even In such elabo- j
rate scenes as "The Tapestry Weavers" j
and the "Maids of Honor," including the
reproduction of the atmospheric medium.
The results that he reached were at
tained not of set purpose, for he had no
ideals, but through a constant preoccupa
tion for realism, assisted by a most deli
cate sense of color. For many "years there
was not even a sign of his later mastery
of planes and of light. It m/us an uncon
scious growth. In fact, tl\ere is nothing
in the work of the first iifteen years of
his career as a painter t/d indicate great
ness. This slowness wr^s natural in him;
it would have been otherwise had he been
as iUnminated gen'ms. Not before the
humor and masterly expression in the '
"Topers," painted. In 1688, just before his
first Italian trip,, oould a great career be
even suspected i&r him. All his tine work ;
was done after the age of 32.
Relying on I>hs own eyesight rather than
on tradition^ methods or schools, Velas- '
quez does hot reflect strongly the influ
ence of a.iv artist. What we do find never
blurs Oje master's own personality. No
man vas less a mannerist,- and If it is â 
natural to separate his work into periods â 
â (I), his juvenile production at Seville; (2)
hi.- 4 early court work at Madrid; (,3j the j
period after his first Italian trip, and (i.Â» j
the period after his second Italian trip- i
it is also true thai the changes are due '
not to the adoption of new methods but
to the rational development of the artist.
His increasing perfection of technique
simply enabled him to attempt new effects
and any sameness, even at any one i
period in his career, was avoided by his j
extreme openness to all shades of natural i
Impressions, which led him to adapt his
means to his ends with endless variety.
j Perhaps one of the most interesting of
his changes was from a reproducer of de
tailed to one of general values, from copy
ing the design on a royal gown and the >
rouge on a royal cheek to giving the dif- .
ferences between reflecting and absorb- i
Ing shadows, or suggesting the effects of
debauchery in the flabblness of the flesh
tones. Of course, at times there Is an
evident difference in the quality of his
brushwork, especially in some of his mid
dle and later portraits, but this is easily
explicable, In that, for Instance, of
"I'ulido Pareja" we know thnt the coarser j
and bolder touch was caused simply by
the use of longer brushes in order that â 
the painter could stand away from his j
canvas while painting. If there is a
similar and even more decidedly impres
sionistic preoccupation in so much of
Titian's later work we may be sure that
in Velasquez it was the result of the
master's own striving for objective truth
fulness.
The range of subjects treated by Ve
lasquez la most interesting and charac
teristic. Biblical subjects interested him
hardly at all. The "Joseph's Coat" of his
first Italian trip was his only incursion I
Into the Old Testament field. The New
Testament subjects he treated very sel
dom and almost entirely during his ear
liest years, while still in Sevilleâ as in
his "St. John in the Desert," his "Adora
tion of the Kings" in Madrid, his "Ador
ation of the Shepherds" in London, so
like a Ribera, his "Christ at the Col
umn." so Italian in feeling, and his
"Christ on the Cross" in Madrid; tneso
latter were the fruit of Italy's Influence.
His very early "Immaculate Conception"
and his late "Coronation of the Virgin"
were the only concessions he made to the
prevalent cult of the Virgin, i^is latest
religious subject, the superb "SS. An
ttaony and Paul in the Desert," is raÂ«her
a picturesque landscape enlivened with
figures and corresponds in Velasquez's
career to Titian's '-St. Pet*>r, Martyr."
Ol classic subjects there are but few;
a weak and bleary "Mara," the academ
ic "Forgre of Vulcan." the trifling â 'Mer
cury and Argus," the realistic but un-
ÃBual "Ventts and Cupld ; " the beggar
studies dubbed "Aesop" and "Mi.
complete this series, least characteristic
nr interesting of any. The â¢'Surrender of
Breda" >\us his only historic piece, and,
superb .is it is, we do not regret that ha
so seldom forsook portraiture for such
elaborate compositions. But if we turn,
to the field of pure observation there
seems hardly a phase of nature unex
plored by the brush of Velasquez. His
incursion into landscape is even more In
teresting historically than for its own,
sake, and he shows himself here as ac
curate a transposer of nature as in hi 3
portraits, though a less familiar one.
His views of the "Villa Medici" in Rome
are the best authenticated of his pure
landscapes, but in a number of his por
trnits the landscape is but littl" second
In importance to the figures. His wCrk
in still life and in animal life, his tavern
Interiors and scenes of outdoor common.
life, are comparable to the best Dutch
work.
In his favorite field, portraiture, he left
no class in society unreproduced, from
street beggars, urchins and peasants,
Morisco slaves and
court buffoons and
dwarfs, up through
village alcades, sol-
diers, country mag-
istrates and gentle-
men. to courtiers,

cardinals and prime
ministers, and. final*-
ly, popes and roy-
alty. Few members

most the whole of

In his treatment of portraitureâ half

i times stand out against a pure tone, at
j times against a drapery, and often are in

, earlier masterpieces, such as the "Don

WEBSTER FOUND A
GOLDEN WINDFALL
GOOD HARD CASH HE DID NOT
KNOW HE HAD.
Back Salary to the Amount of $800
Turned Over to Him by-
Auditor Wells.
R. H. Webster, Superintendent of
Schools, dropped into $800 .of good county
coin yesterday that was just like money
from home. In fact, Mr. Webster has
had that money for nearly a year, but did
not know it until Auditor Wells informed
him of the fact. His windfall represents
the profitable result of the suit which he
brought in 1896 to oust ex-Superintendent
Babcock from office.
In November of 1896 Mr. Webster was
elected Superintendent of Schools, but
Babcock refused to turn over the office,
on the ground that the election was il
legal. Webster Instituted suit, and in
March of 1887 sot a favorable decision.
During the two and a half months the ac
tion was [tending.' however. Babcock con
; to present his salary warrants, and
Auditor Broderick honored them, instead
of holding .them up until such time as a
decision should be handed down.
When, in the latter part of .March, Web
ster was put in office by the court's
dei Ision he presented claims for salary
from January i to March but Brod
erick held them up on the ground that
the salary had already been paid to Bab
"Webster contended that Babcock
had no 'right to draw it. but Broderick
was obdurate, and Webster finally let the
matter pass.
A few weeks ago the warrants came to
the attention of Auditor Wells, who
looked up the history of the case and then
Bought the advi< f his attorney, John
H. Dickinson, who advised him that the
claims should be at once paid, and of that
fact Mr. Wells yesterday Informed the
Superintendent. He also signed the war
rants and directed that they be paid out
of the general fund.
An Official Visit.
The past and present officers of the Su
preme Lodge of the Friends of the For
est paid an official visit last night to Lin
coln Lodge for the purpose of making
themselves acquainted with the condition
of thai subordinate. The officials were
received with rill the honor due their rank
by a goodly number of the members and
of visitors. Under good of the order there
were offered a Dumber of valuable sug
gestions to be discussed in the several
lodges prior to the next session of the
supreme body. Lincoln Lodge will cele
brate the third anniversary ol its institu
tion by an entertainment and banquet in
its lodge room in the Odd Fellows 1 build
ing.
Official Canvass Begun.
The Board of Election Commissioners
began the official canvass of the election
returns yesterday, it was decided to de
vote six hours a day to the work, the
Commissioners alternating from day to
day. No appreciable differences were
found in the first precincts counted.
The following tally clerks were appoint
ed: John J. Liebert Jr. and Robert
Mitchell, Republicans; J. h. Zemansky
and Francis Sullivan. Democrats. L. J.
Welch, Democrat, and W. YV. Biiusman,
Republican, were appointed to handle the
ballots. The compensation of tbese em
ployes will be fixed later. The salaries of
election officers will be paid on Thursday.

The circular of George Morrow & Co. soys:
"Barleyâ R^-eipts last week. 53.390 centals
Stocks on hand in all Call Board warehouses
on Ist lnst. amounted to 93.816 tons, an In
crease for the month of 10,000 tons, which is
simply another evidence of the scarcity of
fillips. Europe stands ready to take all our
good export barley, but shippers, cannot pay
the Llmost prohibitive tariff for vessels to
carry it there.
"Recent heavy rains have naturally tended
to weaken the speculative and local sample
markets, and unless holders of large blocks
of barley now in warehousa can hold the mar
ket up in spite of the natural odds against
them the market la very likely to go still
lower. The local demand for .-;... teed is very
limited at present and buyers act with cau
tion in expectation of lower prices In the near
future. * * .
"Oatsâ Receipts last week. 34.055 centals.
To us the most remarkable thing about the
oat market is the fact that California still
continues at this late date to supply herself
bo largely with oats. This week Oregon only
gives ua 43i:. centals and Washington 7750
cental.". The balance is California's own con
tribution. We cannot recall the year when
California has supplied so many oats at this
time of the year. _.

"Hayâ Receipts last week. 3346 tons. At the
opening of the week the market was inclined

Fcr three days there was no market owing
to the prevailing rain. It is hard to get an
accurate line on the market under the clr
â¢ cumslances. but the chances are good for
somewhat lower prices when the weather
clears. This storm will no doubt put the
finishing touches on a great deal of the hay
which wa.s still in the Held, and to that ex
tent the market should be benefited, but there
Is now no question tut what the stocks of
hay on November 1. available for this market,
wlil equal if not exceed 150,000 tons. This is
cortalnly more than enough to carry us along
until the new crop, which promises to be again
very large. On the whole the outlook, Is not
encouraging."

EASTERN MARKETS
New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK. Nov. 13.-The stock market
showed a short lived hesitation at the opening
this morning and then turned upward. There
was no Important backset for the rest of the
day, and the market closed quiet and firm at
about the top level and at an average of prices
a point or more above that of Saturday.
Early hesitation was caused by the general
conviction that the Increased deficit in the
banks surplus reserve shown by the Saturday
statement would necessitate a large loan con
traction. There was a large demand for money
during the day, but it became manifest early
that there was an abundant supply. The bears
who sold stocks Saturday In anticipation of
forced liquidation began promptly to-day to
buy to cover their short contracts. This was
a considerable element In the day's strength.
So. also, was the buying for London account,
which reached â¢â !â - high as 60,000 shares. This
buying, besides its direct effect, had a' senti
mental Influence, as indicating a reserve foreo
In that market against possible withdrawals
of gola for shipment to New York. The course
of the foreign exchange market during the day
gave color to the conviction in speculative
circles that gold imports are near at hand The
tone of the exchange market during the day
was characterized as demoralised Demand
Filling was sold at one time during the day
at a concession below U 85. At that rate It Is
believed that a small loss would be involved
In the Importation of gold. But It was the
belief on the stock exchange that such an
Importation would be undertaken tor the senti
mental effect on the securities market
The exchange market steadied somewhat with
the late fall in the money market. The limited
culling of loans made it manifest that the con
traction of credits on last Friday had placed
the banks In a better position than was fully
reflected In the weekly bank statement i A '
leans were made on account of the local trust
companies, and the rate was forced down from
the opening at 12 per cert to 5 per cent There
â¢was some relief to the money market from the
leceipt of over J1. 000.000 gold from China, and
several hundred thousand dollars to the assay
on account of gold deposited at interior point:)
Outside financial institutions are said to be
placing loans on a large scale In the stock
market. A suggestion of possible sources of re
lief for local borrowers aside from the banks Is
found In the last balance sheet of the Man
hattan Railway Company, where the item of
loans on call for September 30. 1899, had ex
panded over $13,000,000 compared with the year
before. The fact that the general course of
prices of stooka "luring the past six weeks has
been upward, while the New York banks have
been steadily contracting their credits, indi
cates that borrowers, must have had other
sources of supply on which they have freely
drawn. A feature of to-day's money market
was the enlarged demand in the stock market
for time loans, which were firmly held at (
per cent.
Prices of bonds did not fully respond to the
strength in stocks, but there were sharp rallies
In Borne issues that showed early weakness.

H@%C under Saturday's close, December at 66%
<yGS* t c and May at 70M-ffi7o%c, prices which
were considerably ' â â ! â â â w puts. -The depressing
tone of news was oven more emphatic than had
been expected. The world's shipments for last
week wore over the estimate, Russia looming
up with 2,000,000 bushels, making: the aggregate
8.700.000. Liverpool was weak all day, and re
ported a good Increase in stocks. Local stocks
Increased more than could be accounted for In I
the making of two private bouses regular, and
the visible, with the lakes yet to report, In
creased 2,128,1 '". 'With the exception of a few
damage reports from Illionis and Ohio, crop
conditions were reported perfect. Buying
against puts and a little covering by shorts
caused a little rally following the opening. De
ci-mber touched 86% c and May 70% c. Decem
ber failed to hold against the liquidation which
net in with the bulge and continued scattering
but persistent until near the close. December, I
owing to the change of that option for more i
distant future, told off to CGM;CtIG%e.' while May
advanced and held steady. Near Ihe end of the :
session those who Bold short Saturday bought i
li.erally to cover. December advanced to 67%e
and May 71% c. at which prices they closed.
Save the animation of the close the market'
wan dull and heavy all day. Trading was
principally in the way of changing from De
cember to May contracts.
Corn was comparatively steady at the open
-1 Tit- despite the weakness of wheat. Country
ofieiings were early reported very smalj, while
thÂ«> decrease in the domestic visible '.: 923 000
bushels was larger than expected. These fac
tors sustained the Trice for some time, but
December, except far changes In the May op

There is decidedly a great improvement
noticeable in the Tivoli comic opera com
pany. Whether it is the pretty music and
clever libretto of Messrs. Sullivan and Gil
bert, or whether some unexpected re
juvenator has made his timely appear
ance is difficult to define; the happy fact
remains, however, that in "Patience" the
Tivoli comic opera company has so far
done its very best. All seem to work with
a renewed zeal and what formerly ap
peared to be phlegmatic has now turned
into dash and esprit. Musically too a
sort of transformation has taken place
and if we except Phil Branson and Caro
line Knowles, whose sepulchral tones
seem to hail from the nether regions
there is not one objectionable vocalist in
the entire cast.
William Schuster made quite a hit with
his dragoon song and he had to repeat it
twice. He looked decidedly picturesque
in his Lnglfsh uniform and surely his
I. ritish patriotism must have taken a good
hold of him when singing the praises of
the Queens army. Such men are valu

PLANS FOR THE
NEW HOSPITAL
NOW ADOPTED
Martens & Coffey Are
Successful.
THEIR COMPENSATION FIXED
BATEMAN BROTHERS ALLOWED
ANOTHER EXTENSION.
The Supervisors at their meeting yester
day adopted resolutions accepting the
plans of Martens & Coffey for the new
hospital buildings. These are the plans
that were approved by a Jury of physi
cians. The resolutions were presented by
Supervisor Aigeltinger and seconded by
Supervisor Collins. It developed that the
plans are the joint work of Architects
Martens & Coffey and Mooser & Son. Mr.
Mooser appeared before the board and
requested that the compensation be fixed
at the usual 1 per cent on the total cost,
which is estimated at $600,000. He did not
care to take his chances on the bond levy,
but wanted the board to allow the $5000
out of the general fund, and this pro
vision was finally made.

VICTIM OF ARriED ROBBERS
AFRAID TO GIVE EVIDENCE
OAKLAND, Nov. IS.â No hope is
held out that John Thomas, the
victim of last night's hold-up in
a West Oakland saloon, will
recover. The doctors have not been
able to locate the hullet, and death is
exported at any time.
The police have nothing upon which
tn hold the five suspects who were ar
rested shortly after the robbery and
shooting, and declare that they are
merely hoboes who were cruising
about the railroad yards looking for a
comfortable box-<-ar. Manuel Baptista,
the partner of Thomas, says that he
cannot understand the motive for the
shooting, as there was not enough
money in the till to make it worth
while to plan a robbery. He says that
there is a doubt In his mind as to
whether the motive of the desperadoes
was robbery or murder. Thomas has

reputation. He is about 54 years of age
and married. He has been quite a
prominent factor in West Oakland
polliics. especially among the Portu

It is now said that the gang which
held up Coyne's saloon a week ago,
just a couple of blocks from Thomas'
place, boasts of a political pull strong
enough to prevent prosecution, even If
it cannot prevent arrest. When Coyne
was robbed he told Sergeant Peterson
that he knew the four men and later

they were arrested <'oyne repeated his
statement, but when it came to swear

SACRAMENTOS CHOSEN
TO MEET A PICKED NINE
Eastern Ball-Players and the Capital
City Team to Compete on Thanks
giving Day.
As has already been published in the
j sporting columns of The Call, the Eastern
baseball players who are wintering on
I this coast will, under the management of
the well-known umpire, "Jim" McDon-
I aid, play the teams of the California
League Immediately after Its season
The initial game will be played
1 at Recreation Park, this city, on Thanks
: giving day. The Sacramentos, who have
a tirm hold on the pennant, have been
chosen to meet the crackajacks, and the
"fans" may look forward to a great
game. The only "Jack" Sheridan, so well
known t" the followers of the diamond
as an umpire in the heyday of the na
tional game in ihis city, and who later
distinguished himself in the same ca
pacity in Eastern leagues, has been
chosen to umpire the series. It is under-
StOOd that the other teams of the league
' will be gi\en an opportunity of testing
i i heir strength against the all-star aggre
gation.
Fred Chance, who did so well as a mem
ber of the Chicago nine, Is scheduled to
catch, and for pitchers McDonald lias
chosen James Hughes, the phenomenal
pitcher who helped Brooklyn win the pen
nant this season; Phil Knell, who has
twirled himself into the hearts of the
Hartford "fans," and "Youngy" Johnson.
who pitched good ball for the Oswego
nine.
Samuel Mertes. the fast base runner
and heavy batter of the Chicago team,
will probably play first base. Beckley,
first baseman of the Cincinnati team, is
expected on the coast and if he comes in
time he will play the initial bag and
Mertes will be shifted t" another position.
Popular Henry Keitz of the Pittsburgh
will cover second base. He is a wonder
in that position and will give the local
players points on how to cover the
cushion. "Kid" IHiUn. who played short
tor a Colorado nine, will occupy third
tiase. Although left-handed he can throw
unerringly nnd quickly to first and he
covers a vast bit of territory while in the
game. Harry Lockhead is scheduled to
cover short, the position In which he was
seen when he played with the Crilt Edges.
Lockhead pui up great ball on the Cleve
land team and as he has not had time to
lose form will surely play with his usual
vigor. McDonald has picked three stars
for the outfield. George Van Haltren of
the New York team will play center,
Johnny McCarthy of the Hartfords and
Pat Meaney of the Atlantic League, will
cover right and left field respectively.
The men will begin practicing together
a week before Thanksgiving and will be
in prime condition to give an exhibition
of the game as it is played by experts.

EXPLOSION OF
HITRO-GLYCERINE
Terrific Effect Upon
Vicinity.
TIFFIN, Ohio, Nov. 13.â A rn;igazlne
used by the Bradford Nitro-glyoerine Fac
tory to store the product of their plant,
located two and a half mtles east of Glb
sonburg, exploded this afternoon at 1:30.
The shock was heard at towns within a
radius of forty miles, and the effects of
the explosion In the immediate neighbor
hood were terrific.
The magazine is located in the woods, a
quarter of a mile from any dwelling, and j
thin alone prevented terrible loss of life. .
Benjamin Card, driver of a stock wagon, i
had brought a load of 720 Quarts of nitro- ;
glycerine from the factory at Bradford,'
and was unloading it when the explosion â 
took place. Just how it Happened will
never be learned. Card and the two j
horses driven by him received the full ef
fect of the explosion. He was Mown to
atoms. Only a few shreds of his body .
were found, and pieces of horseflesh were
found miles away. It is supposed that he
! had a companion, but this is not posl-
I tively known.
The explosion made a hole seven feet
deep In the solid rock, and trees in the
vicinity were torn to splinters. People
within' a mile of the place were knocked
flat, pictures were torn from the walls.
dishes thrown out of cupboards, window^
shattered and hou?os moved from their
foundations. All the windows in Gibsi n
-1 burg were broken. There were about 1500
I quarts of glycerine in the wagon and in
the magazine.
Card lived in Bradford. Ohio, and left a
family. The shock was distinctly felt
here. ______________
SENSATIONAL EVIDENCE
IN INSURANCE CASE
Mrs. Sallie R. Hlllmon of I*eaven
worth Seeks to Recover Because
of Her Husband's Death.
LEAVEN WORTH, Kans., Nov. 13.â
Sensational evidence \vas adduced to-day
In the noted Hillmon insurance case, in
which Mrs. Sallle E. Hillmon, for the
fifth time in twenty years, is suing East
ern insurance companies to recover on
policies held by her husband, John \\\
Hillmon, who disappeared in 1879. The at
torneys for Mrs. Hillmon put Arthur Sitn
n.ons, a I^eavenworth ciga r maker, on the
stand, and he swore positively that
Adolpb Walters worked for him in May,
IS7B.
This is two months after the insurance
companies allege that Walters was killed
by Hillmon and one Brown near Medicine
Lodgtj, Kans. Simmons recognised
"Walters by his photograph and showed
his hooks of twenty years ugo to prove
that Walters had worked for hLm at that
time. The main points of the insurance
companies have been to prove that Hill
mon, i'.rown and Levl Baldwin were in n.
conspiracy, and that they killed Walters
to. pass his body off for that of Hillmon.
The insurance, with Interest, involved,
now amounts to nearly $100,000.
NAVAL GOVERNOR FOR
ISLAND OF TUTUILA
Administration of America's Samoan
Possession to Be Modeled After
That of Guam.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 13.â Jurtge Cham
bers, Chief Justice of Samoa, who is now
in this country on leave of absence, called
at the State Department to-day and had
a long conference with Secretary Hay re
specting Samoan affairs, and particularly
the conditions of the island of Tutuila,
which is to become the exclusive property
of the United States upon the ratification
of the recently arranged division of the
Samoan group. The Chief Justice made
a favorable report upon the island, which
has a native population of about 7000 per
sons, for whom some form of government
must be devised. It probably will be pat
terned after that at Guam, where the
navy maintains a naval Governor.
The closing chapters of the history of
the administration under the Berlin
treaty are to be set out in a report which
Judge Chambers has prepared and will
submit to the Secretary of State to^-mor
row.

DELEGATES ASSEMBLE FOR THE FLOOD-WATER CONVENTION
Mayor Phelan to
Extend the
Welcome.
An Outline of the Re
salts It Is Hoped
Will Be Achieved.
THE first convention of the Califor
nia State Association for the Stor
age of Flood Waters will tv called
to order at 10:30 o'clock this morning
in the Maple Room of the Palace
Hotel. Not less than 400 delegates, repre
senting the commercial, agricultural,
mining and manufacturing interests of
the State, will answer the rollcall.
â  The purpose of the association, as set
"forth fully in circulars heretofore sent
'broadcast. is 'to enlist the organized co
operation of the people of the State in. the
â formulation nn.i execution of a successful
.'plan fcr impounding and distributing the
.flood waters of Californiaâ now running to
'vaste.and causing much destructionâ for
line in developing the commercial, manu
facturing, agricultural and mining re
"isources of the State.
"Our merchants should fully realize the
. value of the issue of this gigantic work,"
pays K. W. Dohrinann. president of the
Merchants' Association, in a circular ls
'isued recently. "It will give impetus
to ill the industries of California that
'will prove constant and lasting. Not only
'v.-ill agriculture and mining flourisn
through this beneficent agency, but there
T.ill be developed a mighty power that
v,i\\ make Calllor.nla one of the foremost
[manufacturing centers of the Union. The
I .high cost of coal has always retarded
manufacturing in this State. Through
this new agency, now going to waste, will
be generated a force that will give to the
"future mills, factories and foundries of
California what the cheap coal of the
Eastern States has given to tiie thriving
â¢innusirie? of New Yoik, Pennsylvania
and Connecticut. Therefore it behooves
every mercnam and manufacturer tJ
participate in the work of the Caliiorma
jjtate Association for the Storage ot Flooa
"Waters, and co-operate in every way pos
sible to^brlr.g about thf successful con
summation i>t its labors."
That in in a nutshell the purpose â â : this
'ccmvvr.iiou and the iirst. step in the r:giu
direction will be to form a permanent or
ganization to carry into t-rTeet the best
plans that may be offered.
' The general response of the various bod
ies -invited to sn:d delegates to the con
ventionâattested by the out of town sig
natures on the hotel registers and at tne
association roomsâ augurs well for --he
ueik?rai interest excited in the project.
.'.they came from all parts of the State and
they are full of the subject) even if it is
fsuch an Insipid fluid as flood water. They
will consider it in all Its phases and they
will' try to uevise ways and means to con
serve it.
Firstâ That annual losses from overflow
ing streams may be averted.
â¢ beccidâ That farmers and orchardists
may no longer be threatened by the ter
rors of arid summers.
Thirdâ Thai the area of irrigation may
be so enlarged that agricultural, horticul
tural and viticultural interests, attract
ing increased rural populations, may be
extended.
Fourthâ increased power for man
â¢.-ufacturing can be gained from the
streams and be harnessed for the best
good cjf the mining industry.
The disastrous results of the drought of
IK'T-yS taught the people of this State two
wholesome truths. One that there is no
eafe'or certain assurance of an ample or
even! sufficient rainfall each year; and
the other that the flood waters that go
to waste in seasons of abundant rain and
enow must be conserved for possible sea
eor,B of drought.
To solve the gigantic problem of ade
quate irrigation in California It is eon
* ceded will involve considerable and con
tinuous expenditures of public funds.
Eastern States have their own wants and
troubles. Out of about lOO.CKxi.OOo acres of
Irrigable arid land belonging to the United
Slates, only 17,u00,0tXi acres are in Califor
nia. Until' their own necessities are satis
lied, the other States will hardly consent
.to any considerable contribution from the
.â¢National Government to this local under
taking. The meager appropriations made
by Congress for the urgent needs of Call
â¢fornia harbors and rivers .-â¢ em to be suf
.â .ficient answer to those who claim that
'.this issue should be left wholly to the
management and control of the Federal
Government. California, however, ex
pects and welcomes any aid that may be
extended by the Federal Government in
facilitating the irrigation of the arid lands
ot the State, and on this supposition the
delegates go Into convention this morn
ing.
â  i 'resident William Thomas of the Cali
fornia Association for the Storage of
Flood Waters, pleased with the outlook
for a large convention, said last evening
â that there were glorious possibilities
for the State if action can be taken by
which, ultimately, the waste waters
could be impounded.
"In the first place," he said, "half the
ADVERTISEMENTS.
Of 1533 Orange Street, Los Angeles, Cal.,
writes : " I had been afflicted with my
eyes for over a year with such a dreadful
itching and inflammation that I conM
not u.-e them for anything. Physicians
had given me many different remedies
which were like using so much water ;
they measured my eyes for glasses, which
I got and wore for some time, but they
did not benefit me in the least. My
mother desired me to write to Dr. R. V.
Pierce and explain the condition of my
eyes. I did so, and after following your
advice, and using eight bottles of the
' Favorite Prescription ' and eight of the
' Golden Medical Discovery,' can say my
trouble is entirely cured. I would advise
any one so afflicted to try these wonder-
ful medicines. My health was riever so
good as it is now, and I shall never tire
of praising Dr. Pierces medicines."

mining ditches of the State have run dry
during the past two years. If the water
of the streams from which the ditch sup
plies were taken had been stored and
used in the dry season the mines would
have produced millions of dollars more,
because not over .5 per cent of the mines
have been worked the past two sum

--000 in 1898 one-half coul I have been saved
by the storage of the waste waters. These
facts indicate what advantages might
come to ail the Strue if the waters that
annually go to wa te were stored."
As an indication of I ;pon which
the association can go to work, a state
ment made yesterday by J. B. LJppin
cott of I. es, resident hydro
grapher for Arizona and California of the.
Tnited States Geological Survey, is
timely.
"The United States Geological Survey,"
he said, "is organized under the aus
pices of the Departmi :it of the Inte
rior. Its work cmsists of the investiga
tion f'f the physical resources of the
United States. There are. four distinct
divisions â lirst, topography; second, geol
ogy; third, hydrography; fourth, f
try. The topographic map Is considered
as the essential hasis for the other inves
tigations. In th( Si " â¢ California per
a third of the enl i has been
Burveyed In this manner. There are now
and have been during the , t ten years
from three to six topographical iield par
ties at work in various portions of t hr-
State. The Sierras la.-., been surveyed
practically from the northern line of the
south and including the 3ToÂ»
.h! Park. The Sierra Madre range
ha? been largely mapped in Southern Cal
â¢ â 
"The hydrographic work consists of the
study of the strc-am flow of typical rivers.
In California ffteen such streams have
been selected, beginning a.l Red Bluff and
extending to the Mexican line Upon
thr-so streams numerous measuremi 1
discharge are made and 6 rda of
river heights observed. From this data
an accurate statement can b< made or the
daily and annual output of these rivers.
This department of the survey has also
explored a portion of tl- king
for reservoir sites for th< I Hood
waters. The director of the geological
sur\'ey Is empowered by law to set aside
for public use any such reservoir sites
found. Forty-two Buch sites have been
selected and so segregated. During the

The California Shipping Company was
Incorporated yesterday. It is the outcome
of th* Mijfhell syndicate that purchased
the Flint line of sailing ships, the first of
which sailed from Hongkong for Tacoma
yesterday. The pioneeer vessel of the pur
chase is the May Flint, and she will load
wheat on the Sound for Europe and will
then come to San Francisco with a gen
eral cargo.
The officers of the new company are:
W. E. Mlghell, president and manager;
Charles Bondron, vice president; William
Babcock, secretary; and the Bank of <"ali
fornla treasurer. As soon as the charters
of the ten vessels expire they will be
brought to this port and will then be op
erated and fitted out here. The quicker
the company gets its vessels on this coaat
the better It will be pleased, as every one
of them could be chartered at good figures
if they were now in port.
It has been stated on the front that all
the vessels controlled by Mr. Mlghell will
go into the new company, but this La de
nied by the man most interested. Mr
Mighell says that the management of his
outside fleet will remain Just the same as
!t has been for years, and none of the
ships will go into the syndicate.

Mr. Lippincott's views will command
considerable attention in the convention,
and to-night at Metropolitan Temple he
will give the delegau-s and the public the
fruit.s of his study of the flood water
problem. Mr. Elwood Mead will also be
heard this evening.
Mayor Phelan will deliver the address
of welcome this morning to the delegates
assembled in the maple room, following
which temporary organization will be ef
fected, with F. W. Dohrmann of the Mer
chants' Association a strong choice for
temporary chairman.
The temporary roll of the convention la
nearly complete. Many delegates will not
arrive until this morning, but the ac
. r.ces of appointment indicate who
will attend the proceedings. The purpose
was to make the representation as com
plete as possible. Delegates at largo,

afternoon and considerably damaged the
latter. There is a great deal of wheat on
the Sound awaiting shipment, and the
Miami has b<-*-n temporarily withdrawn
from the coal trade to carry grain. Yes
terday she arrived from Seattle with a
load of wheat, and the tug Sea Witch
went out to assist her in docking at the
seawall. The tide was running like a mill
and as the Miami approached sec
tion 1 "f the seawall she broached to ana
went broadside on against the George
Loomls and barkentine Gleaner. The lat
ter was only slightly damaged, but the
Loomls lost her after rail and her stern
was very much damaged. She will be
compelled to lie over a trip to repair.
Whilt- the Boa Witch was trying to hold
the Miami the hawser parted and Cap
tain Pave Shaw was knocked down, but
luckily escaped with slight injuries. After
ollision the tugs Redmond and 80a
Queen wont to the assistance of the Sea
Witch and the Miami was put in a Bafe
berth.
Captain Frank Tuttle will take com
mand of the revenue cutter Pear to-day
and about Thursday the w-ssel will sail
for San Diego, where she will lie up until
April next. The cutter has not been dried
out since she came on this coast, and It
is the intention of Captain Tuttle to take
advantage of the dry air of Lower Cali
fornia and by its means rejuvenate the
old boat. The- Bear has been so long in
the water that she Is water soaked and
in consequence cannot make better than
fight knots. On her arrival in San Diego
she will he tied up at a wharf at Coro
nado and there everything except the
boilers and engines will be taken OUt of
her. Wtadsails will be rigged and the
dry air turned Into her lower hold and
the vessel thoroughly dried out. The en
tire crew will live ashore and the men
will not take up their quarters aboard
again until the vessel is ready to sail.
The drying-out process is expected to add
two knots to the speed of the Bear. April
next she will come back to San Fran
cisco and will clear from here for the
Arctic.
J. M. Wall was back "on 'change" yes
terday. He has been on a business and
pleasure trip to the East and visited
Washington, Chicago. St. Paul and New
York. While in New York he witnessed
the Jeffrlee-Sharkey fight and also saw
the last race for the America's cup. Mr.
"Wall thinks the Columbia could outsail
the Shamrock at any stage of the game
and 1b also of the opinion that the fight
for the championship should have been a
draw. "Jeffries had the hrtter of it In the
first three and last three rounds," said he
yesterday, "but in all the others Sharkey
ii: out the pace."
Thomas S. Allen, a ship carpenter, met
with a peculiar accident on the transport
Pathan yesterday. He slipped on the
gangplank, and in the fall tors all the

FATHER YORKE
WELCOMED BY
HIS ADMIRERS
Given a Tremendous
Ovation.
The Catholic Truth Society tendered a
ion last evening to Rev. Peter C.
Yorke in honor of his return from his trip
and triumphs abroad. Metropolitan Hall
was selected as the place for extending
the welcome, but it proved to be far too
small to hold the crowd that was eager to
do honor to the eloquent priest As early
as 6 o'clock in the evening the crowd be
gan to gather, and within an hour and a
half the police were forced to close the
outer doors of the hall, which by that i
time was tilled far beyond a comfortable
limit. Hundreds who failed to get in
stood around the Fifth-street and Jes
sie-street entrances fightine for an oppor
tunity to pass the vigilance of the outer
guards.
Father Torke's reception was a tre
mendous ovation. No man in public life
in this city could have been more heartily
and enthusiastically received. His ari
pearance was tho signal for a burst of aS
plause that lasted for several minutes
The 1 audience arose to its feet and
cheered, and as the echoes died away the
applause was renewed time and time
again, until it finally ceased through the
pure exhaustion of the crowd
Frank J. Kierce, vice president of the
Catholic Truth Society, presided over the
meeting. Mr. Kierce said that it was
pleasing to the society to have an au
dience of such magnitude to assist in
welcoming home "one of the most loyal
advocates of and earnest workers for
religious freedom and Catholicism." Dur
ii.tr Mr Kierce's. remarks Father McKin
non appeared and he was given a warm
greeting.
The duty of extending the welcome to
Father Yorke devolved upon E. P
Murphy. He gave expression to all of the
feeling of joy and sincerity that pervaded
the audience. His remarks struck a re

sponsive chord. "When he spoke in words |
of praise of the honored guest the multi
tude that listened attentively signaled
their approval by many a round of hearty j
cheering. Â Â _.
â¢â¢I consider it a proud honor, said Mr.
Murphy, "to be granted the privilege of
endeavoring to express the loving wel
come you all feel In your hearts for him â 
who has come back to us. Human words
can but feebly express the great, deep,
unbounded love we all feel for our own
Father Yorke." (Great applause.) "I bay
our Father Yorke, for it was here that he
won his glorious victory fÂ°r God, his j
church and his people. Who among us is
not better, firmer and nobler from the
fact that Father Yorke has lived and la
in. r.-l among us? His treatment while
abroad, especially at the Vatican, was
public recognition of deeds well done and >
duty well performed. And now that his
journey for health and rest is over, we
welcome him home, not only as d Catholic
and a priest hut as a patriotic American i
citiz.n. Father Yorke. loyal citizen, firm
and true friend, sifted priest, all hail!
Thrice welcome home!" . i
When Father Yorke arose to respond
the enthusiasm broke forth with all of its |
force. The priest stood and waited for ;
tbe 'heering to cease. He smiled at the
warmth of the welcome, and as nis face
lighted up the cheering was renewed. Fin
ally during a lull his voice rose above the :
din: "I have waited a year to talk to you
again. I guess I can wait for a few mm- ,
utes longer." The cheers rang out again
with more vim than ever, and i*. seemed ,
that the audience would never get i
through. When it did Father Yorke pro- !
ceeded with an address that thrilled j
every one who heard his words.
"Isn't it a good thing to be home? Need
I tell you that I am glad? In all of my
travels I found no land better than that 'â 
over which floats the stars and stripes;
no State better than this, and no people
more generous or loyal than those of our
own city. I would like to tell you all that
I think, but I see that you have- not
brought your blankets." He spoke at \
length of "Rome, Pope I.co and all that he i
represents. He said that Leo was the i
greatest Pope of the nineteenth century, <
as he hoped he would be in the twentieth.
"He is the first Pope of modern times
who has taken all of us into his conn
dence. He recognizes that the days of
monarchies are gone; that the people are
the church, and what the people want the
church to be the church must certainly
become."
The separation of church and state were
treated upon, and politicians who attempt i
fo use the church to further their own
enda were given a scorching. At the con
clusion of the address the audience rushed
upon the platform and crowded about
Father Yorke, almost fighting for a
chance to grasp his hand.
FLED TO HER
PARENTS AFTER
HER MARRIAGE
Mrs. Reddan Hates
Her Husband.
Despite the fact that August C. Red
dan and Grace M. Lynch were united in
marriage by the Rev. John Hemphill of
Calvary Presbyterian Church, the bride
refuses to live with her young husband
and accuses him of being a hypnotist,
iiKly and a racetrack tout. Mrs. Reddan
has fled to her parents for protection and
Papa Lynch and other members of the
now famous family are guarding the fair
maid from the machinations of an al
leged unscrupulous husband, whose bane
ful glances have hypnotized her into an
oppressive alliance.
The story of the romantic courtship is
not unlike others of the kind. Reddan,
who is employed by the California Jockey
Club and resides with his parents at oil
Jones street, met the young lady two
years ago' and has kept company with !
her during that period. She was not loth '
to accept his invitation to go out with
him and was frequently in his company. ;
Young Reddan broached marriage to her
and she accepted him. On Wednesday
evening last they were united at the home j
of the groom's parents by Dr. Hemphill
and early the following morning the bride,
realising the step she had taken, fled to
her parents for forgiveness. The latter
listened to their daughter's tearful story,
wiped the pearly drops from her large
black eyes and forgave her for what she
had done. Fearing that her husband
would demand his own and even use force
to secure her, the parents sent her to a
relative who resides in the Mission, and
she is now there safe from he"r better
half.
Mrs. Reddan (nee Lynch), who is the
daughter of Daniel Lynch, a Chinatown
guide, and a sister of Irene Lynch, the
young girl who created such a sensation
a year ago by running away from home
and who was afterward found in a lodg
ing-house with a woman of low charac
ter, resides at 22 Octavia street. She
claims that she does not care for Reddan;
that she never received a present from
him in her life, and that he was a race
track tout and wielded an influence over
her that compelled her to submit t<-> his
will. She cites her marriage to him as an
instance of the latter charge and asserts
that he used hypnotism in getting her to
atrpp to a marriage. She also says that
Re. Man could not support a wife, and
wanted her to support him off her earn
ings as a musician, she being an accom
plished violinist. Mrs. Reddan says she
would die before she would gaze on his
ugly face again, and expects to be shortly
released from her unsatisfactory mar-
Young Mr. Reddan has not the appear
ance of being capable of using such means
to secure his wife's heart and hand. He
is but 2* years old and has a good face.
He helps to support his father and mother
out of the salary he receives at the race
track, and resides with them on Jones
street. He regrets that his wife has been
so ill advised as to make such foolish as
sertions against himself, but declines to
cast any aspersions on her or defend him
self from the charges at this time, as he
