British Make a Gallant Attack Upon a Burgher
Camp, Capturing It and Inflicting Heavy
Loss Upon Its Defenders.
LONDON, Nov. 6.â The War Office issued the following at 11:40 P. M. yesterday:
BULLER TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR:
CAPETOWN, Nov. s.â The commandant at Durban sends the Following,
received From Ladysmith by pigeon post, dated November 3: "Yesterday
General French went out with cavalry and Field artillery and eFfectively shelled the
Boer laager without loss on our side.
"Lieutenant Egerton oF the PowerFul is dead. General Joubert sent in Major C.
S. Kincaid of the Royal Irish Fusileers and nine wounded prisoners. Eight Boers were
sent out in exchange, no others being Fit to travel.
"ColonerÃrecklehurst, with cavalry, Field artillery, the Imperial Light Horse and
the Natal Mounted Volunteers, was engaged to-day with the enemy to the southwest
of Ladysmith. The fighting lasted several hours. Our loss was very small.
"The bombardment oF Ladysmith continued yesterday and to-day, many Boer
shells being pitched into the town.
"Our troops are in good health and spirits and the wounded are doing well."
I think General French's name is given by mistake For Brecklehurst's.
A special dispatch from Ladysmith, describing Thursday's fighting, says:
"The artillery duel at dawn, in which the Boers' guns were silenced, was intended to oc
cupy the Boers and to enable Sir George Stewart White to achieve his chief purpose, the capture
of the Boer camp behind Besters Hill.
"For this purpose the Lancers, Hussars, Natal Carbineers and Xatal Border Rifles started
tinder General French at sunrise and got within striking distance before the enemy was aware of
their presence. A held bcrftery also was sent, and it secured a good position, commanding the
enemy's camp, which was a large one laagered with army wagons and other vehicles.
'"P>esters Hill was well fortified and provided with good guns. At 9 o'clock the British
opened fire, the Boers replying with spirit, but bad aim. The British quickly sent a 42-pound
shell into the camp, inflicting terrible loss and spreading panic among the enemy. Our cavalry
then stormed the position, the Boers fleeing precipitately, leaving many dead and wounded as
well as the whole camp and equipment in the hands of the British. Their success will upset the
plans of the Orange Free State commanders and possibly will prevent them giving the British
further trouble from the west."
The Times publishes a dispatch from Pietermaritzburg, Natal, dated November 3, which
says:
"The Dutch residents here have received news of a sanguinary
battle fought yesterday, probably between Ladysmith and Colenso. A
large number of the Boers were killed, many being relatives of Natal
Dutch residing in this place. The English residents have no knowledge
of any engagement."
The correspondent of the Times at Ladysmith, under date of November 2, confirms the
report of artillery exchanges. He says:
"The investment of the town is now practically complete. Last night the enemy tapped the
n our rear. He can. therefore, cut our communication whenever he pleases. It is sug
gested, however, that the Boers believe that Ladysmith is in their power and that they are there
to anxious to have us get up all of our military stores before they attack us.
"A reconnoissance by lancers and a field battery to-day found a Free State laager, which
the British shelled heavily, driving the Boers out"

BOERS DELAYED TOO
LONG AT LADYSMITH
LONDON. Nov. 6.â The general belief in
BRITISH LOSS AT
FARQUHAR FARM
DURBAN, Natal, Nov. 2 (Delayed
in transmission).â The official roll
call shows that 843 members of the
Gloucestershire regiment and of the
Royal Irish P"usileers are missing
as the result of the engagement on
Farquhar's farm. Thirty-two men
of the Gloucestershire regiment, ton
members of the Royal Irish Fusil
eers and two members of the Tenth
mountain battery were found killed.
Between 70 and 100 escaped ami re
turned to Ladysmlth, whither 150
wounded have been brought.
London Is that the Boers are now wait
ing for more guns from Pretoria before
attacking Ladysmlth. The fact that Sir
Redvers Buller appears to have ordered
a retirement from Stormberg, and per
haps from other places, relieves to some
extent the public mind, which otherwise
would have been further alarmed. ConÂ»
fldence is felt in any measures that Gen
eral Buller may deem desirable. The
knowledge that the pigeon post is work
ing has also come as a relief to tha great
anxiety previously felt.
The third-class cruiser Pelorus has been
ordered from Gibraltar to Durban and
the third-class cruiser Fearless from Port
Said to the fime point.
Dispatches from Cape Town and other
centers in Cape Colony indicate that the
Cape Dutch are becoming very restless
in consequence of the Boer successes.
The Morning Post's Ladysmith corre
spondent, telegraphing November 1, says:
"We cannot understand the Ivor tac
tics. It Is Incoinpreliensiblio tiSit they
should have refrained from using their
big guns this morning."
Commenting upon this dispatch, the
Morning Post says: "It is easy to guess
the reason why the Boers have been
nonplussed by the arrival of the naval
guns at Ladysmlth. They are now re
gretting a lost opportunity, as they
might have cut the railway and thus pre
vented the appearance of those guns on
the scene."
The Times in a careful editorial to-day
on the relations of the United States to
the war in South Africa says: "When
the Continent rings with denunciations of
England it is very cheering and refresh
ing for the English people to note the
sympathy and intelligent comprehension
manifested in the United States. We
should prize American sympathy in any
case, but it becomes doubly grateful when
manifestly based on a deliberate and well
informed Judgment of the essential merits
of the quarrel, as well as upon a recipro
cation of the kindly feelings with which
Englishmen regard American enterprises.
"The American people are not Winded
by the accident that the Transvaal calls
Itself a republic. They know that every
essential attribute of a republic Is grant
ing; and they know also that England
stands for equal laws, Individual freedom
and the energetic progress which to
gether make up the republican ideal or
the Americans. As England plumped for
the United States, so the United Slates
now plump for England without n gard
to the fine-drawn technicalities of the at
torney."
It appears that the Boers have dc
stroyed the railway as far down as Knap
tlaar, eighteen miles south of Bethulie.
FIGHTING PRECEDING

Firing Is now in progress on Ladysmlth,
which the Boers are shelling from their
positions on Groblerskloof Hill, this side
of Ladysmith.
Two trains have just arrived here from
Ladysmith. When near Pieters Station

The Boers continue to shell Colenso and
Fort Wylte, but thus far the firing is
futile. They have placed heavy guns in

REPORTED RISING OF
BASUTOS AGAINST BOERS
LONPON", Nov. 6.â According to a spe
cial dispatch from Cape Town It Is re
ported there that the Basutos have risen
against, the Orange Free State Boers.
The Government has received no infor
mation on this point.
A special dispatch from Ladysmith, filed
Thursday afternoon, says: "While the
naval brigade was pounding away at the
Boer batteries this morning a party of
British cavalry and volunteers were sent
out. Creeping around the hills, they sur
prised and captured one of the enemy's
camps."
A special dispatch from Ladysmith de
scribing the engagement at Besters Hill
says the Boers were completely routed
and suffered heavy loss. Their entire
camp was captured. The correspondent
goes on to say:
"An artillery duel is In progress. A
British shell struck a Boer 40-pounder
and completely wrecked it." 9
The transports have just been secured
for the Woolwich howitzer brigade,
which will be hurried to the Cape. The
brigade has 10,000 rounds of 5-inch lyd
dite shells awaiting It. According to the
estimates, a single shell, falling Into a
compact body, will kill 300 men. It was
demonstrated in the battle of Omdur
man, which destroyed the army of Kha
lifa Abdullah, that large numbers of
Dervishes were killed by suffocation,
while hundreds of vultures and eagles
fell on the battlefield from the same
cause.
FINE MARKSMANSHIP OF

T.ONDON. Nov. 5.â A dispatch to the
Daily Mail from Kummnn, British Bech

"Three hundred Bechuanaland Boers
have Joined Commandant De Lacy's force
which has gone to Kimberley, leaving
only 200 men at Vryburg."
G. W. Stevens, describing for the Mail
the affair at Nicholsons Nek, says:
"The Boors shot magnificently The
moment a Britisher raised his head to
see where the enemy were, he instantly
fell back with a buliet in it. On the other
hand, after the engagement, the Boers
acted with the greatest kindness to the
wounded and unwounded. They spent
the afternoon singing doleful hymns â and
they had reason to be doleful, for they
had lost many men."

LONDON, Nov. 6. â This dispatch from its
special correspondent is published by the
Daily Telegraph :
CAPE TOWN, Nov. I.â The correspondent of
the Cape Times telegraphs that a .arge com
jmando of Free State Boers attacked Norvals
Pont bridge at 5 o'clock this morning. They

NEW YORK, Nov. 5.â A Journal
cablegram from Cape Town dated
Novembers, says: After long hesi
tation the Free State Burghers have
commenced the invasion of Cape
Colony with a strong force.
As was expected, they have chosen as
the scene of their operations the Coles
burg district, which is the center of the
Afrikander disaffection, and where a
rising has been expected at any time.
The enemy had been concentrating their
forces at Bethulie and at Springfontein.
They crossed the frontier on Wednesday
at Norvels Pont, on the railway bridge
over the Orange river, and advanced
along the railway and highway. They
occupied Colesburg without resistance.
The only force at Colesburg was a small
squad of police under a sergeant. They
surrendered and are now prisoners of war.
Colesburg has 2,000 inhabitants, all Dutch.

MRS. MILDRbD HAZÂ£N.
NEW YORK, Nov. s.â Mrs. Mildred ITazen. Admiral Dewey's bride-elect,
with her mother, Mrs. Washington McLean, Bpent all day yesterday In
shops and at modistes preparing her bridal trousseau. They started out
early with a single-bi rse brougham (or the shopping district. All day
In ceaseless tide of feminine consultations over fabrics and fashion there
was only one pause; that was when in its passage down Fifth avenue
their carriage halted for a few moments under the Dewoy arch. Questions were
asked of the driver, and expressions of admiration were exchanged between
Mrs. Hazen and her mother.
The minor details of her trousseau were considered early in the day. and
about 4 o'clock in the afternoon the carriage, containing Mrs. Ilazen, her mother
and her sister. Mrs. Ludlow, drew up in front of an establishment on East
Forty-sixth street. Here an order for the majority of her gowns had been
placed some days ago and yesterday afternoon the task of fitting and remodel
ing was begun.
Mrs. Hazen expressed herself as well pleased with her choice and asked that
there might be no delay in completing her order. Thirty-eight pieces compose
the trousseauâ nine street dresses, eleven dinner gowns, seven house dresses,
five opera cloaks, five coats and a tea gown. Some of these, including the bridal
dress, were chosen from the modiste's imported stock, but the majority will be
of American rhaj?e. constructed according to the preferences and suggestions of
Mrs. Hazen. Many of the dresses will be brocades and satins, which are ap
parently Mrs. Hazen's favorites.
Owing to the fact that Mrs. Hazen has but recently laid aside mourning
no colors other than black, gray and white will be used in her trousseau. Mod
esty and good taste have characterized her choice of garments. Expense has
not been spared, but there has been no attempt on Mrs. Hazen's part to choose
an elaborate wardrobe, but it is estimated that the dresses will cost $7600.
Mrs. Hazen will probably choose 'as her bridal" gown a dull gray Parisian
gown, embroidered in silver and trimmed with point lace. It is the opinion
of dressmakers that Mrs. Hazen's charms are shown to best advantage in this
gown.
It is expected that on Monday night or Tuesday morning Mrs. Hazen will
return to Washington. Admiral Dowey has arrived at New York to meet hl#
fiancee. â  - â¢ . - .... . ,

ments do not regard him as an ordinary
crank, as their letters to him testify.
The Inventor refuses to divulge what his
strange instrumi nt is, but perhaps some
n of a scientific turn of mind might
guess from studying the hints which he
has dropped now and then.
Some time ago he called on the attorney
of the yam a Fe B

he directed Evans to go ahead and fit up

For some time Evans has been se^n by
his comrades at a blacksmith shop, mak

was inukinK a bracket.
"It was on the 9th of August last that 1

more execution at a. distance of half a
mile from an object than a half dosen

kind. The invention would be about as
useful in war fur offensive as for de
fensive purposes. 1 could equip soldiers
with it at an expense of about 50 cents to
a man. It would certainly prove a great
"weapon where a decisive fight was on."

THE BAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, NOVEMBER 0, 1899.
ENGLISH WIT
A SETTLEMENT
Reopeningthe Hawaiian
Land Question.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
HONOLULU. Oct.' 27.â The Government
sent by the China a request for certain
other information regarding the letter
and opinion of Attorney General Griggs
respecting British claims, in connection
with the 1895 revolution here.
The instructions, if such they may be
â  called, received by the America M&TO, ap
pear rather vague. President llii! > 1 4 oea
not construe the letter to be Instructions,
strictly speaking, it is a fact that no
direction is given as to what sort of settle
ments are. to be made, when they shall
be made nor how they shall be made.
There may be a difference of opinion as
to Whether the letter contains instructions
, or not.
In referring 'he matters back to the
Hawaiian Government, the letter states
j that they are resubmitted "for considera
tion and settlement." The auestion Is
how far d'l^j that go? Does it mean settle-,
ment on a basis of Attorney General
<;>-:^s' reasoning;, which is general In
character, or does ii leave the matter en
tirely in the hands of the Government of
Hawaii to do as it pleases about it, the
United States holding to its former policy
of having absolutely nothing to do wkÂ»i
the quest ions?
Cr, ..!â â ! Dole thinks the matters are
again entirely in the hands of the local
government, on practically the old basts.
â  are those in town, however, who
think that as the matters were taken up
years ago as the subject of diplomatic
correspondence between Hawaii and
Great Britain, they are still pending m
much the same attitude, that following
annexation they must become a matter
between Washington and London. The
words "consideration and settlement"
; may mean a good deal.
OBJECTS TO THE
ALASKA MODUS VIVENDI
James Hamilton Lewis, Who Repre
sented the Atlin Miners, Says
Canada Is Gainer.
; NEW YORK, Nov. s.â Ex-Congressman
James H. Lewis of Seattle. Wash., who
went to England to look after the inter
â¢: the, Atlin miners in the settlement
of the Alaskan boundary question, re
turned on the St. Paul to-day. Mr. Lewis
said:
"My objection to the modus Vivendi is
that "it accords to Canada all the privi
- in the Porcupine mining district
!i are allowed to Americans. Being
i American territory, this course is op
! posed to the one Canada has pursued by
I a late legislative act, prohibiting any
mining rights taken up. by us in the Atlin
let.
â¢â¢I pointed mit to the House a year ago
that there was a misconception as to
what was meant by a boundary line in a
Russian deed and an English grant. The
Russian boundary, where it touches
water, circles the water side and follows
the course of either lowland or moun
tains. This gives us all the water ports
in the disputed territory. With the new
arrangements, the line is drawn hori
zontally from mountain top to mountain
t"l>. Water ports between these moun
tain tops are considered and taken to be
the property of Canada wherever the
, water extends across the line. In this
waSr Canada enjoys one part of the water
. and we the other.
"What impressed me was that Canada
was willing to abandon and yield the <i;s
puted territory for a. water port. Knp
land sees ahead a war in the Bast and so
she wants a naval mustering station in
I Alaska."
TRIES TO KILL
A WHOLE FAMILY
George Barthell Murders His Wife,
Injures Her Parents and
Commits Suicide.
ST. LOI'IS. Nov. s.â George Barthell, a
foreman in the wholesale house of the
Simmons Hardware Company, to-day
fatally thot his wife, beat h.s wife's
I father and mother Into insensibility and
then killed himself. Harthell had
separated from his wife for four years,
and during that time had mad.* rep
requests that .she return to him, but to
no avail.
This afternoon Barthell walked into the
I home of his wife's parents, Mr.
i and Mrs. John Rohlfing, with a
revolver in each hand and with
out saying a word he Bred a shot
! at his wife. The ball went Wide and Mrs.
I Barthell fled from the room. Barthell
then knocked Rohlfing insensible with the
butt of his revolver. Mrs. Rohlfing en
deavored to protect her husband and In
tlie struggle received a broken nose , nd
blows from the weapon that also rendered
her unconscious. Barthell then chased
i his wife from ihe house and, catching
', her at the gate, fired three shots, two
â  taking effect in the head, causing mortal
wounds, und one In the arm. Barthell
i stood over his wife's fallen form for an
instant as if to satisfy himself that she.
'.v;is dead, and then blew out his braina.
At a late hour to-night Mr. and Mrs.
I Rohlfing bad noi regained consciousness
ani^ Mrs. parthell was reported 'lying.

POLITICAL.
CITIZENS'
NON-PARTISAN
PARTY.
FOR GOOD GOVERNMENT.
To the Voters of San Francisco: The Non-
] Partisan party was organized seven years ago
: to wrest from professional politicians the con-
trol of municipal affairs and to separate en-
i tlrely from national politics the Belectlon of
i city and county officials.
It has nt all times opposed machine politics,
and foiifrht to elect worthy men to office by In-
dependent nomination or indorsement.
ThÂ° la*t Legislature passed a law expressly
almiHl at the "unwelcome interference" In
public affairs of nun-partisan organizations.
The Rickard act forbids any information on the
ballot concerning the indorsements that a can-
dldat? may receive and makes It impossible for
;i m.-:r. to be nominated by two parties. Such
' a creditable occurrence as the nomination last
| year by the two great parties of John Lack-
-1 mnnn for Supervisor could not be repeated.
i V> regard this law as pernicious In principle
! nnd against public policy, and we Intend to
, vigorously contest It.
Th>< adoption of a non-partisan charter, the
! result of thÂ» lad primary election, and the ln-
â¢ dependent character of the recent Republican
j nnd Democratic conventions, clearly indicate,
, however, that the Criendi of pood government
j bnvn awnkened to their duties.
With these changed conditiuns we feel that
â¢ there is no occasion for an entire Non- Partisan
ticket -it this election.
It is. however, a fundamental principle of
this rarty to support those nominees who have
faithfully and fearlessly filled their offices and
j are renomlnatsd for the same office. We would
fa!! in our obligations were we to leave this
: work undone.
We therefore unqualifiedly reenmmend for
j your eufrrage at the coming election:
For Mayor JAMES D, PHELAN
For Assessor. WASHINGTON DODGE
For Auditor ASA R. WELLS
For City and County Attorney...
FRANKLIN K. LANt
To each of those faithful servants of the
people there Is certainly due a generous meas-
i ure of credit arl encouragement, for the able
i and honest manner in which they have ful-
filled their public trust.
This committee, furthermore, realizing the
difficulty fflr each individual voter to inform
himself as to the qualifications of the many
j candidates for the Board of Supervisors, has
piven careful and Impartial study to the rffla-
. tive merits of the nominees on the several
i tickets.
i As the result of continuous work by this
! committee, extending over a month's time, re-
I pardlnsr this important department of the city
! government, we feel justified in recommending
for your support and vote, irrespective of
party lines, the following eighteen citizens, se-
lected from the Republif-an and Democratic
tickets, to constitute the first Board of Super-
visors under *the new charter:

WeellrEall $11 w YearFOSTER PREDICTS THE
DEFEAT OF MEAN
Money and Expansion Questions a
Disturbing Influence in Ohio
Politics.
S~>\ INCINNATI, Nov. The most
| significant development in the Ohio
I campaign since yesterday Is the
V_y prediction made by ex-Governor
Charles Poster, who has been speak
ing throughout the State. He estimates
the total vote of the State at 975,000, of
which Nash (R.) will get not less than
465.000. McLean (D.) not more than 410.000,
and Jones (Non-Partisan) and all others j
â will divide the remainder. Yet Mr. Foster
paid there was a strong probability that
Jones would cut down this estimate on
the leading candidates, but if he did three
fourths of the cutting would be on the
McLean vote. Mr. Foster predicts that
the Republicans will secure both nouses
of the Legislature.
A peculiar feature of the campaign has
been the use by both parties of utterances
of ex-Senator J*>hn Sherman. Senator
Sherman has a warm feeling for Judge
Nash, and the Republican papers have
published telegrams from him showing
that feeling. One printed to-day, ad
dressed to Chairman Dick of the Repub
lican State Committee, says:
"I feel the deepest solicitude for the elec
tion of Judge Nash. It will mean victory
for sound money and prosperity."
It is also well known that Mr. Sherman
has a cordial feeling for President Mc-
Klnley and Senator Hanna and that he
openly antagonizes the President's Phil
ippine policy. Hence the Democratic pa
pers have been .publishing- Interviews and
â dispatches from ex-Senator Sherman indi
cating his position in that regard. One
of the latter addressed to the editor of an
Ohio Democratic paper contained the fol
lowing:
"I am strongly opposed to the enforced !
annexation of the Philippine Islands. The
seizure of any port of the Philippines
against their will is an aggressive viola
tion of the law of nations."
It is claimed by Republicans that the
alienation of Republicans who disagree
with the administration on the Philippine
question will be more than offset by the
Democrats who believe in upholding the
CJovernment and who oppose silver.

SORRY HE SPOKE
Fully Retracts Former
Statements.
NOTHING AGAINST CLARK
TEE TONGUE PROVES ITSELF AN
UNRULY MEMBER.
Stephens' Following Decreases Each
Day and the Success of the
Republican Nominee Is
Assured.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, Nov. 6.â Trustee Kent,
â whose vicious attack on George Clark, the
Republican candidate for Mayor, caused
a mild sensation a few days ago, is out
with a statement in which he says that
he made a mistake in attacking Clark,
and is sorry for it. This statement ap
pear 3in to-day's issue of the Sunday
News, and is remarkable in many re
spects.
After declaring that he was cajoled Into
saying that Clark had asked him to join
the combination which was said to have
existed in the Board of Trustees, Kent
says: "I want to tell Clark that 1 did
not intend to do him any harm when I
was interviewed by the reporter who
wrote the article.. 1 was led into a trap
and foolishly allowed my tongue to run
away with my head. George has been
one of my best friends. Out of sympathy
for my condition he induced me to ac
company him to Stockton, where he had
me placed in a private asylum. After
being discharged I felt sore against him,
as I did not think he had a right to have
me immured in an insane asylum.
"I intended to speak to him neverthe
less, and pretend to be friendly, but when
1 met him he gave me the "glassy eye.'
Of course I felt hurt and resolved never
to speak to him again. Now I realize
that 1 was a little 'off,' and that George
did right in having me confined in an
asylum. I used to go where there was
music, as the sweet strains of a church
organ or a piano would relieve my head.
] realize that I did many things at the
time that were queer and showed that 1
was 'nutty.' I don't like the way the
newspapers act. You know during the
Yon Arnold incident 1 went to the paper
that published the stuff about my friend,
George. (lark, and lifting my hand to my
Maker swore that 1 had never taken a
cent that did not rightfully belong to me.
N"t withstanding my solemn avowal, that
same paper published some things that
wÂ«re not to my credit, and it kind of
hurt me. I don't like the newspapers to
pry into a man's private affairs and l
don't think that evening paper should
have published anything about my friend,
George Clark.
"I am sorry he referred to my asylum
experience, i admit 1 started the fuss,
but 1 don't want him or anybody else to
say that 1 was an inmate of a private
insane asylum. 1 now warn him and his
friends tnat if the newspapers publish
another story that my mind is disordered
and that 1 am crazy 1 will take matter*
in my own hands.
"If they do there will be serious trouble
and somebody will suffer, even If 1 have
to go to jail for it. 1 know I will get a
fair trial for anything that I may Jo. I
again warn all of you not to have the
newspapers say that I am crazy or that
1 was an inmate of an insane asylum. 1
may not br able to get even in one way,
but I will in another. If they continue to
hound me 1 will get out on the street cor
ners and tell what I know about the do
ings of the Board of Trustees."
i he statement was made in the presence
of William M. Sims, chairman of the Re
publican city central committee and sev
eral other responsible citizens.
The colored citizens arc making a vig
orous light against Stephens, the Demo
cratic candidate. Prank J. Butler, one of
the lt-ading colored citizens and a promi
nent Mason, is leading the opposition
against the candidacy of Stephens. When
Been to-day he said:
"Yes, it is true that the colored voters
of Sacramento are unalterably opposed to
Stephens. He showed his true colors
when in IS7O he voted against the fifteenth
amendment giving the negro the right to
vote. He was then a member of the Leg
islature and became known as the hated
enemy of the colored people of this State.
Out of the 30 colored voters in this city it
.is extremely doubtful if Stephens gets a
half dozen. Even if it were not for his
malodorous record 1 would not vote for
him.
"His career in the past shows him to be
unfit for the office hi- now seeks. Every
respectable citizen, whether he be white
or colored, should work to encompass his
defeat. He has always been an enemy of
good government, particularly friendly
with the corporations and o posed to the
men who toil for a living. Mr. ("lark, his
opponent, is a representative citizen, char
itable to a fault, and always ready and
anxious to assist the poor and down-trod
den What Sacramento needs is a young,
man like Mr. Clark to handle the reins of
government. lie knows the needs of the
city, and as we have entered upon a new
era of prosperity it becomes the bounden
duty of every citizen to take off his coat,
so to speak, and see that he is elected by
a handsome majority."
SHARKEY IS ANXIOUS
FOR ANOTHER FIGHT
Defeated Pugilist Is Still Suffering
From the Effects of Jef
fries' Blows.
NEW YORK, Nov. s.â Thomas Sharkey,
I In pain and encased in a plaster support,
' spent to-day quietly in his quarters. He
was constantly attended by his physi
cians, who ordered him to be absolutely
quiet. The defeated pugilist was restive
and uncomfortable till a sleeping powder
I had been administered. Then he fell into
a deep Bleep, which lasted all afternoon.
The burden of Sharkey's talk was that
he wanted to meet Jeffries again. The
champion, on the other hand, while de
claring that he was in the hands of his
managers, asserted his willingness to
grant the sailor his desire, though ho did
not see why he should be expected to
do so.
"But, you know," he said, "there is
such a thing as being driven to a fight."
Sharkey said that he wanted another
fight in eight weeks, and. was going to
post $5000 forfeit to-morrow. ORourke,
his manager, said he was doing his best
to bring the match about.
"To-morrow morning early," O'Rourke
said. "1 am going to post with George
f'onsldine a $5000 forfeit to get a return
match with Jeffries. It will be a bet as
well as a forfeit. Sharkey says he feels
all right and can fight at the end of eiu'ht
weeks. I think, however, that the period
is too short and I will name four months
as the time. I do not know whether Jef
fries and his manager will cover this or
not, but we will leave it to the general
public to decide haw just our position is.
; Jeffries, owes it to Shnrkey and the public
ti K\yi us another match. We are in
i earnest about this. Shnrkey feels lie [a
the better man ;iml he ought to have a
1 fair chance to prove It."
Brady aaid, when asked about a return
i match: "What I have determined Is this:
Jeffries needs a rest. He would have
knocked Sharkey clean out early in the
! light iC he had been recovered from his
fight with Fitzsimmons. He has licked
I Sharkey twice. J think It will be next
I August before Jeffries has another fieht,
! and my impressions are that it will take
I place In ParlF."

TROUBLE BREWING
AT MARE ISLAND
A General Strike Is
Threatened.
SHIPWRIGHTS DISSATISFIED
SOME HAVE ALREADY ASKED
FOR DISCHARGE TICKETS.
Other Tradesmen Will Probably Join
in the Demand for the Restora
tion of the Old
Schedule.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
VALLEJO, Nov. s.â From present indi
cations the former good relations exist
ing between the' Government on the one
hand and the employes of the United
States navy yard at Mare Island on the
other are destined to be strained to a
grave degree in the near future.
Friday at noon fifty-one shipwrights re
quested from the naval constructor in
chaise of the construction and repair de
partment an increase of wages or their
discharge. The latter course was taken.
On Friday two more did likewise. This
action Is the result of the decision of the
Board of Wages last July recommending
to the Secretary of the Navy a reduction
of shipwright's pay from $4 SO to $4 24 per
day. In the "good old days" on Mare
island these men received $5 04 per day.
Tt is asserted by the shipwrights that
Naval Constructor Frank W. Hibbs, a
member of the Board of Wages, is di
rectly responsible tor this reduction of
wages and fathered it first and last. This
has made him very unpopular among the
men, and vengeance is threatened on all
sides. Advertisements have appeared in
the San Francisco papers calling for ship
wrights, but none have applied for work.
Telegrams have been sent to Portland
and the Northwest for shipwrights with
little hope of sticcess.
The United States steamship Hartford
lies in the large stone dock with huge
openings in her sides, awaiting the handi
work of the shipwright, while telegraphic
orders lie on the desk of the captain's
cabin for th.-> Hartford to leave Mare Isl
and with the least possible delay.
And this is not all. There are whisper
ings In town to-night that other trades
men sympathizing with the shipwrights
and smarting under the sting of previous

BATTLE ROYAL IN
THE SAN RAFAEL JAIL
Five "British" Officers Held at Bay
by a "Boer"' Man and
Woman.
PAX RAFAEL. Nov. S.â "Wow! They
are the British and we the Boors. Give
It to them, Mike." With those martial
words of encouragement, Mary Cuneo, a
woman whose name is known In every
Police / Court in San Francisco, rushed to
the assistance of a drunken laborer
named Michael Murello, In the County
.Tail to-night, and swatted Constable
Apnew viciously over the head with a
piece of board. Murello swung a chair
with equal effect, and in a minute's time
the two Boers, male and female, had driv
en five stalwart officers o" ih< law into
an outer room and laagered themselves
mar a stairway. It took thirty minutes
for the British to recover their lost ter
ritory, during which time the County Jail
witnessed what was perhaps the most ex
citing scene In its history.
Murello was arrested to-night in ihe
South End for visiting the house of his
divorced wife and ejecting her from the
premises, with a threat that he would
take her life. Simultaneously the Cuneo
woman was arrested at the broad-guage
depot for disturbing the peace. The
woman reached the prison first, and when
Murello was led in. kicking, biting and
cursing, she pave her war cry and led
him on to temporary victory against the
officers.
During the melee Jailkeeper Gooige
Atchley nearly had his head broken by
a piece of coal] which he had dodged in
the nick of time, and Marsha! Healy
closed a door none too soon to avoid a
heavy billet of wood. Threats and coax-
Ing were of no avail, and the drunken
man and woman had too much ammu
nition in stock in the shape of broken
chairs, pieces of coal and other missiles
to risk a direct attack. Strategy prevailed
at the expiration of a half hour. An
armored train was formed of an old door
and two constables, and while the atten
tion of the Boers was detracted by a
skirmish from the rear, the constables
li. !ii the door before them and rushed
the two frenzied prisoners. They were
overpowered and placed in rolls, while the
officials adjourned for refreshments.
ANGLO-SAXON ENTENTE
ON CHINESE QUESTION
NEW YORK, Nov. s.â The Journal's
Washington correspondent says: The al
liance between Gr^Jit Britain and the
United States as to the Chinese question
has at last assumed concrete form. The
State Department has sought to create
the impression than not even an under
standing lias been reached, but on Sat
urday no effort to disguise the fact was
made.
The T'nited States and Great Britain
will forcibly resist any agresslon made
by European powers in China.
Secretary Hay sent for Rear Admiral
Crownlnsbield, chief of the Bureau of
Navigation, and the two conferred for a
half hour. Secretary Hay. it is under
stood, wanted to ascertain, first, when
the last of the reinforcements for the As
iatic fleet already ordered would reach
Asiatic waters; second, what other ves
sels would be available for duty In the
Orient In the event of an emergency re
quiring further reinforcements.
Rear Admiral Crowninshield replied
that the Brooklyn, now at Port Said
would reach its destination !n less than
three weeks; the New Orleans, at Porto
del Gado, in five weeks; the Marietta
nearing Gibraltar, in four weeks; the
Nashville, at Gibraltar, at. out the same
time; the Newark, at Honolulu, in less
than three weeks.
In answer to the second question It Is
understood Crowninshif-M replied the yes
sels Immediately available in an emer
gency call were Schley's squadron.
SULU GROUP WORTHLESS
TO THE UNITED STATES
WASHINGTON, Nov. s.â "We shall nev
er be able to make anything out of the
Sulu Islands and they will prove a verita
ble white elephant. If we could exchange
them with Holland for the island of Cura
coa in the Oarribean Sea, for a considera
tion, we should be fortunate, and it would
also secure us a good neighbor in the Phil
ippines."
These are the conclusions of lieutenant
A. P. Niblack, now on duty on board the
battleship Oregon.
"The Spanish have never been able to
collect any revenues and their occupation
has only been effective in the last few
years. We shall be obliged to police the
islands by means of gunboats. The Dutch
have talent for handling these East In
dian people, and besides have native
troops and police."
Lieutenant Niblack then spoke of the
advisability of transferring the islands to
the Dutch in exchange for Ouracoa.
Hobart's Condition the Same.
PATERSON, Nov. s.â There was no
improvement in the condition of Vice
President Hobart to-day. Messages of
sympathy were received from President
McKlnley, Secretary and Mrs. Hay and
General Wesley Merritt. Among the call
ers at the Hobart residence was Attorney
General Griggs.
EXPEDITION SENT TO
SURROUND AGUINALDO
Troops Moving From Three Direc=
lions for the Attack on the
Filipino Capital.
MANILA, Nov. s.â This evening a ,
fleet of transports and gunboats
left Manila for the most impor
tant expedition of the autumn
campaign. Its destination is sup
posed to be Dagupan or some other north
ern port.
General Wheaton commands, with a
brigade consisting of the Thirteenth In
fantry, the Thirty-third Infantry, two
guns of the Sixth Artillery and two Gat
llngs. The transports Sheridan. Francisco
de Reyes and Aztec carry- the troops, with
the gunboat Helena as escort.
A dispatch boat was sent ahead to ar
range a rendezvous with the United
States cruiser Charleston and the other
warships that are patrolling the north
coast of Luzon.
It is assumed here that the purpose of
the expedition is to move down the Dagu
! pan-Manila Railroad toward Tarlac, or to
! prevent Aguinaldo's forces making anoth
ier base farther north. Dagupan and Ap
parri are the strongholds of the Insur
gents in the north.
It has been the unanimous opinion of
military experts that Dagupan should be
made the base of operations, but sufficient
troops have heretofore been lacking. With
Generals Wheaton, Mac Arthur and Law
ton moving upon Tarlac from three direc
tions and the mountains hemming in the
other side, the insurgents' capital will
soon become untenable. Agulnaldo may
attempt to shift his headquarters to the
rich tobacco country at the northern end
of the island. It will be difficult for the
insurgents* to escape.
Should the concerted operations succeed,
organized insurrection on a large scale
should be at an end early next spring, al
though guerrilla warfare is likely to con
tinue for a long time. No one anticipates
that the insurgents will make many hard
battles.
CORRESPONDENT ROSS
DEFENDS GENERAL OTIS
HONOLULU, Oct. 27.â E. C. Ross, war
correspondent of Frank Leslie's Weekly,
is one of the passengers on the transport
Ohio on his way from the Philippines to
the Transvaal. He has been at the front
with the American forces for about six
months and is going now to watch the
fiKhting of the English and Boers. Mr.
Ross is quite familiar with the state of
affairs in Luzon and in Guam, where the
Ohio stopped on its way up.
Regarding the campaigning under Otis.
Mr. Ross s;rys that very little is being
done at the present time," and the general
is waiting for more men. "I do not un
derstand the attacks upon General Otis
unless politics is the cause." said the
journalist. "It began in the States and
not In Manila. As a matter of fact, there
has been no particular call for general
ship recently, no very active operations
being attempted. In my experience there
was no difficulty with the general, and I
never suffered from his reported changing
of matter submitted to the censor." At
Guam Mr. Koss reports very quiet condi
tions.
The United States steamship Yosemite
is in the harbor. Her marines are put at
work in the city and are bitter in com
plaints regarding their treatment. They
are compelled to labor in the sewers and
on the streets and to do work that the
natives refuse to do.
Several other of the correspondents at
Manila are leaving via Eastern route to
go to the Transvaal.
Two deaths occurred on the voyage,

INSURGENTS PUNISHED
BY SMITH AND O'BRIEN
MANILA. Nov. 6.â Two columns of |
General Mac Arthur's division yesterday |
took Magaling, about six mil^s northeast |
of Angeles. Colonel Smith, with two bat
talions of the Seventh Infantry, two guns
of the First Artillery and a body of engi
neers, advanced from Angeles. Major
O'Brien, with a battalion of the Seven
teenth Infantry and two troops of the
Fourth Cavalry, moved from Calulut.
Colonel Smith killed eleven insurgents,
wounded 128 and captured fifty, as well
as taking a lot of insurgent transporta
tion.
Major O'Brien killed . forty-nine insur
gents, wounded many and took twenty
eight prisoners. The Americans had I
eleven men wounded.
General "Wheaton will start In the I
morning with the Thirteenth and Thirty
third regiments, with two 3-inch and two
Gatling guns, and will proceed on the
transports Sheridan, Aztec and Francisco
Reyes to a port on the gulf of Lingayen,
which is to the northwest of that part j
of the country in which the principal ope
rations are now being tarried on. The j
gunboat Helena will accompany this ex- I
pedition. The Charleston is already in the
gulf and the Bennington may co-operate
in the movement.
After landing Wheaton's column will
move eastward toward the Caraballo |
Mountains. In the meantime Lawton, j
whose force is moving to the northwest,
will endeavor to connect with Wheaton
and prevent the enemy's escape through
the Caraballo Mountains into the north
ern provinces.
Mac Arthur's column will continue
steadiiy northward, clearing the country
between him and Lawton and Wheaton. i
The insurgents are hurriedly digging in- j
trenchments along the twenty miles of j
road from Aliaga to Tarlac, and also I
along other roads leading to Tarlac. j
Heavy intrenchments have also been
thrown up in front of Bambam, some
seventeen miles south of Tarlac on the
line of the Dagupan railway.
Lawton's scouts have been far to the
north of Cabanatuan toward the road
leading from Tayug to Bayonbong. This
and one other are the only roads cross
ing the mountains. The Americans will
occupy these roads in force. The rebels
will thus be compelled to use rough, nar
row trails, which will necessitate much
splitting of their forces in order to effect
an escape.
The most recent information shows that
Aguinaldo is still at Tarlac, despite re
ports that the rebels had abandoned that
place and were fleeing northward. There
lis a large insurgent hospital at Tayug.
Reports received by Otis show the in
surgent <apital to have been partly re
moved to Bayambang, about twenty-four
miles northwest of Tarlac.
Railroads and rolling stock have been
practically destroyed by the rebels. The
rebels are in hard straits for ammunition.
They are mostly using a had quality of
self-made black powder and working nurd
with ancient Spanish artillery, -"'ighting
BOUfn of the Manila line will be confined
to what is absolutely necessary to main
tain the present position. The real ob
jective point is north, and it is in this di
rection the chief efforts will be made. It
seems now that there is a good prospect
of comparatively early success.

VOTE FOR THE WHOLE TICKET.
T~\EPUBLICANS and independent voters should
in mind to-morrow that for purpose
bear in mind tomorrow that for the purpose
* *â  of assuring the welfare of the municipality it
will not be sufficient to elect one or two of the Re
publican candidates. A Republican Mayor should
have the support of a Republican Board of Super
visors and have as his colleagues in the administra
tion Republicans at the head of the other departments
of the city and county government.
From the nature of our political methods the is
: sues of each contest are associated with the heads of
, the opposing tickets and other candidates are com
| paratiyely overlooked. This has been seemingly a
! contest between Horace Davis and Mayor Phelan, but
there are many more issues at stake than those in
volved in the struggle for the Mayoralty. The other
officer to be filled are important, and Republicans
> and their allies among the independent voters of the
city should go to the polls intent upon electing the
whole Republican ticket from top to bottom.
In the contrast between the record of the Republi
can majority of the present Board of Supervisors and
that of the Democratic majority on the board that
: preceded a striking object lesson is presented for the
instruction of voters. The former board was con
j trolled by Democrats whose nomination was virtually
due to Phelan himself; it was essentially a board of
his selection, and yet it was so corrupt and so offen
| sive in its corruption that an effort was made to oust
! the majority from office and Phelan joined in the
effort. The Republican board now in office has kept
its pledges to the people, has accomplished much for
I the public welfare and would have achieved more
' had there been at the head of affairs a Republican
Mayor in sympathy with its efforts.
A Republican Board of Supervisors to uphold and
support the Mayor in the work of administration and
in undertaking plans for municipal progress and im
provement is one of the objects for which all Repub
licans should diligently strive. Fortunately the men
who compose the ticket are personally strong. There
lis not one of them who is not well fitted for the
office, not one who cannot be relied upon to be faith
ful to the pledges of the party platform and to every
, duty which the public vice will require of him.
I The voters of the city should feel a high degree of
gratification in having the opportunity to elect such
men to take charge of municipal affairs.
Reasons equally valid urge Republicans to vote
. unitedly for the candidates for the various city and
county offices. The whole independent and Republi
can vote should be given for Asa R. Wells for Aud

QUESTIONS ABOUT BONDS.
THERE are several questions connected with
- Phelan's proposed issue of bond? tor
the construction, reconstruction p.nd repair of
schoolhouses which should be settled before the city
goes to the expense of holding an election. A bond
issue for the extraordinary necessities of the School
Department i? a part of Mr. Phelan's campaign. Ho
has involved himself in difficulties with the school
teachers, and in an effort to square matters now vig
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, NOVEMBER 6, 1899.
orously supports a bond issue, the proceeds of which,
it is thought, will so relieve the school fund as to
obviate the necessity of reducing salaries.
But reasons of this kind â even the pressing emer
gency of perpetuating Mr. Phelan's bossism in this
cityâ should not govern in a matter of such grave
importance. The paramount consideration of issu
ing valid bonds â bonds which will command a ready
sale and bring a substantial premium â should out
weigh all other considerations, for it must be patent
to everybody that an issue of invalid bonds is a
municipal absurdity.
The election proposed for the latter part of De
cember, at which, under a resolution of the Board of
Supervisors, the people will be asked to pass upon the
question of issuing $1,300,000 in school bonds, is
authorized by a general law called the ''municipal im
provement act," passed in 1889 and amended in 180.3.
When the new charter goes into effect on January 1
next this statute will no longer apply to San Fran
cisco, because issuing bonds is a "municipal affair"
within the meaning of the constitutional amendment
of 1896. In the charter cases the other day the Su
preme Court decided that where provision is made in
a municipal charter for a "municipal affair" a general
law upon the same subject no longer applies.
After January 1 beyond question the Supervisors
will not possess authority to issue bonds under this
statute. The question is, therefore, What effect had
the constitutional amendment of 1896 upon the "mu
nicipal improvement act?" Did it repeal the statute?
< )r, what is quite as interesting. Will the going into
effect of the charter on January 1 invalidate bonds
issued under the act?
The new charter provides a method of issuing
bonds for school purposes entirely different from
that found in the "municipal improvement act." It
limits the yearly amount to be expended for all school
purposes to $32 50 per pupil in attendance during the
preceding fiscal year. Does this forbid the issu
ance of bonds for the construction, reconstruction
and repair of schoolhouses? It tends in that direction,
for in another part of the charter provision is made
for an extra levy for school purposes in case of
calamity or for a bond issue when it becomes neces
sary to construct a public building.
But whatever judgment the lay mind may form by
attempting to reconcile these contradictions, one
tiling is quite apparent. The proposed school bonds
should not be left to promote the political aspirations
of Mayor Phelan nor become the sport of his politi
cal necessities. Before r.n election is called the sub
ject in all its phases should be referred to competent
legal counsel and a course mapped out which will not
result ii incurring the expense of an invalid bond
is-ue. The Mayor's demagogy may with great pro
priety be confined to less important matters.
THE ELECTION TO-MORROW
A 7 ITH the mass-meetings and other political
gatherings of Saturday night, the arguments
gatherings of Saturday night, the arguments
and appeals of the municipal contest closed.
To-day will be given to the work of preparation for
the election, and to-morrow the votes will be cast and
the issues decided according to the will of the ma
jority.
On the Republican side there has been conducted
a campaign clean and clear. The efforts made by
Phelan and his organs to divert attention from the
real issues at Â«take by setting spies to watch Repub
lican candidates by day and by night, by resorting to
vile caricatures and by charging with treason every
man who opposes Phelan's re-election, have failed of
their purpose. The interests at stake in the contest
remain distinct and unmistakable, and it will be upon
their conceptions of what will best serve these inter
ests that the intelligent voters of the city will cast
their ballots.
Men who believe in free silver and the other dec
larations of the Chicago platform, who sincerely
think that the upholding of the cause represented by
Bryan is essential to the good of the community.
will of course vote for the ticket headed by C. D.
Cleveland, for that is the only ticket that represents
and stands for the principles adopted by the Demo
cratic and Populist fusion in 1896.
Voters who care more for the Democratic name
than for Democratic principles, who would sooner
follow the McNab committee of one hundred than th-
Chicago platform, will vote for Phelan, who in this
fight wears the livery of Democracy and whose success
will be accounted throughout the Union as a
Democratic victory. Strong Democratic partisans
will desire their party to have the prestige of a tri
umph of the Pacific Coast, and will, therefore, be in
clined to count municipal interests as of secondary
importance to the election of the Democratic ticket.
The great mass of intelligent voters will on the
ether hand consider the interests of the municipality
and of the country rather than those of parties. They
are aware that the prevailing prosperity of the people
is due to the policies advocated, adopted and main
tained by the Republican party. Having to choose
between the party of prosperity and the party of
calamity, they will vote for prosperity. On general
; principles, therefore, the vote of business men, tax-
I payers, workingmen. will be given for the Republican
I nominees in order that it may be understood through
-1 out the Union that San Francisco is on the side of
I protection, sound money, Lunest finance, profitable
I industry and good wages.
There are, moreover, many special reasons why the
i independent voters as well as Republicans should
vote for the Republican ticket. It is in every respect
the strongest ticket ever presented to the people of
j San Francisco in a municipal contest. The detectives
! sent out by the Pheian organs to track and trace the
Republican candidates to find out where they dine
and where they spend the nights discovered nothing
I which the skill of the fakers could by misrepresenta
j tion distort into an offense against either public or
private morality,
The Republican ticket is clean. It stands for the
j party of prosperity in the nation and in the city. It is
; made up of men who represent the best elements of
! our people. It stands for progress and for economy.
jlt has made no demagogic promises. What it has
I pledged that will it do. It is the ticket for which all
I loyal Republicans will vote and for which all intelli
] gent citizens ought to vote, for it is the ticket which
I will best serve the interests of all in the administra
tion of municipal affairs.

ment of mines and mining, with the ex
."n of the substitution of W. P. ECeyes
for W. C. Ralston. A mating of the ex
ecutive committee to consider various im
t matters will be called soon.
The proceedings of the last convention
will soon be published in pamphlet form,
and the preparation of the matter is one
of the association matters that has helped
: to keep Secretary Benjamin busy since the
convention. The association will now for
! two months or so miss the active services
i of its secretary. Mr. Benjamin, in his
j capacity of an experienced mfnging en
i gineer, will this evening leave San Fran
cisco for Unga Island and the northern
Alaskan coast, where he is being sent by i
the Alaska Commercial Company to ex- i
pert and report on various prospects and
partially developed mining properties
which It has acquired. The company ex
pects to do a good deal of development
on its gold, copper and other Alaskan
mining properties next year, and will be
guided by Mr. Benjamin's report.
Secretary Benjamin has received a let
ter from Assistant Secretary Dwight of
the American Institute of Mining En
gineers, in the course of which he says
that the recent California meeting of the
institute was the star one of its history.
It was not expected by the wise that
the visit and entertainment of these East
ern mining engineers and their trips about
the mining regions of the State would
result directly in the early investment of
Eastern capital, but already two of the'
visiting mining men have returned to
California, backed by large Eastern capi
tal, and last week they offered $350,000 for
i an important mine in one of the mining
I regions visited. The owners asked $400,000
and a deal is still under negotiation.
Those interested prefer to say nothing un
til the proposition is settled. There is no
question that the recent visit of this dis
tinguished body will be an immense ad
vantage to the mining industry here and
result in large investments of capital in
the future, though not many of such in
vestments may be directly traced to the
California meeting of the institute.
The recent circular of the Anti-Debris
Association, containing another blast
against hydraulic mining, mainly by at
tacking the sufficiency and stability of
the restraining dams built by hydraulic
miners under license and approval of
the United States engineers of the !
California Debris Commission, has fallen J
quite flat. The circular recommends the
"absolute and unconditional prohibition of
hydraulic mining." but it is too late now
to gain a hearing before public opinion*
for any such extreme pleas for a revival
of the old valley war on the miners. The
public opinion of the State heartily sane-
I tioned the plan embodied in the Cam
-1 Inettl law to provide a partial rehabilita
tion of a vast but ruined industry under
I conditions that, would protect the valley
i interests and be carried out under the
supervision of able and impartial Federal
' engineers, and it sanctions the continued
conservative but vigorous policy of the
California Miners' Association in trying
to secure the big restraining dams in the |
foothills that will retain for all time the
debris now In the upper courses of the
streams and what may hereafter reach
those streams. The only injury to the
hydraulic miners which the Anti-Debris
Association can hope to accomplish lies
in the possibilities of the recent suit at
tacking the Caminettl law. and this im
| portant legal contest, which will be first
I tried In the Superior Court of Sutler and
! Tuba counties, may possibly be settled
on appeal during the coming year.
The California Debris Commission has
at last settled on a plan and location for
a restraining dam on the Yuba River, and
what this plan Is will be known before
the end of the year, when it is reported to
Washington. It is thus likely that the ex
penditure of that $500,000 will begin dur
ing 1900 and that provision for other dams
by Congress will follow. Such dams will
make immaterial the questions of the
'. sufficiency and endurance of the individual
log dams erected in the canyons far
I above though these dams must continue
to be erected and maintained under the
Camir.etti law by all hydrauilckf rs. The
Federal engineers have declared these log
dams safe and sufficient, and their judg
ment is generally accepted.
Up to date, since 1893, the California
Debris Commission. has received 4?,S appli
cations for permits to mine by the hy
draulic arocess on the watersheds of the
navigable streams, mainly on the Sierra
Nevada slope of the Sacramento dralnÂ«ge
area, and 344 permits have been granted.
For various reasons only about 150 are
now operating. A few mines have already
been worked out. Others lack water
Some are in legal or financial trouble.
Some are not yet ready to work. During
ISS9 there have been filed so far twenty
seven applications distributed by counties
as follows: Sierra 5. Plumas 9. Nevada 2
Amador 1, Caiaveras 2. Butto 3. Yuba l'
Shasta 1, El Dorado 2. The variety of

i cants is yhown by the following partial

I Amid the great boom in the field of iron
i production, it doesn't cost anything to re
; member Â»hat California has some of the
I richest and most Immense Iron deposits,
which nature has gathered In small places
about this world, and that economic con
j ditions will probably arise which will in
' the not so very far distant future make
these stores of iron things to be reckored
: with in the great Iron markets of the
world. ,'â '-'
J While 'mmense bodies of valuable iron
! ore occur in a number of localities ! r om
Shasta, Nevada and other northern
counties, to the south, the greatest de
posits are in San Bernardino and Nevada
counties. If these deposits were as near
| to the transportation, smelting, market
and other present conditions of the lion
trade as the ores of the Mesaba rane- in
Michigan the latter, for which lake freight
rates have more than doubled, would be
in eclipse.
Probably the largest deposit on the
coast is in San Bernardino County, six
teen miles from Newberry, In the desert,
and this is one of the largest deposits of
iron in the United States. It has been
frequently described in official reports,
but it has never yielded a pound of iron.
Th^n at the minants in Madera County i
in the Sierra Nevadaa is another wonder
ful store of iron. It is hematite and mag- |
netite ore running from 64 to 66 per cent j
of iron and one vein exposes a mas? .v*<
feet wide, 1500 feet high and two miles
long. What is in sight would supply the
world fnr years. The other iron stores ot
California 'an- varied and vast.
The trouble with California iron orea
is, of course, that with the cost of fuel |
and so on out here a ton of Alabama pig
iron can be brought here for about the i
cost of the fuel to smelt a ton of Call
fornla ore. California's stores of iron are i
away from both transportation and iuei.
But while the iron trade is booming and '
ruling the civilized industrial world and
being Its barometer we may also remem
ber that in California's great future the ,
time may come before long when the pro- ;
duction of iron, which cuts absolutely no
figure now. will be one of the great fac- ,
tors in its mining and industrial life. Cal- I
ifornia iron ores will be smelted when
ever conditions allow a profit on the ope- I
ration. How and when those conditions
will become present will not be prophe
sied here. But every related pr
seems to lend to the ultimate production
of California iron.
The multiplication of cheap electric ,
power in the Sierras is one thing. Th* |
oil boom with its great possibilities of the
production of cheaper fuel in the forms !
of oil and gas presents another possibil
ity. Almost in sight of the towering :
minar' ts above the San Joaquin Valley
men are swarming over the ground in I
which nature has stored fuel and the vast !
tonnage of the Great Lakes cannot take
Michigan iron ores fast enough at treble !
rates toward Plttsburg over several times j
the distance from the minarets to the oil j
fields or the coast. A few weeks ago i
David Williams, proprietor of the Iron |
Age, said in an interview in The Call that j
he regarded the prospects of the cheap j
production and cheap transportation of j
Chinese coal as the most likely solution'
of the Iron problem of the Pacific Coast, j
In whatever form the solution may
come it is interesting to contemplate both
the possibility and the probability of iron
production and iron working becoming
features of the great industrial and com- j
mercial future which seems dawning on \
the Pacific Coast and on the Golden State, i
This raging oil boom is going to be a fine
thing for the State industrially, a lucky
thing for a few people, and a mighty bad
thing for a good many others. In the
past two weeks about forty new oil com
panies have been added to the several
hundred existing incorporations. In San
Francisco still more capitalists, business
and professional men, street-car employes,
washerwomen, et al., are investing in oil
stocks. Many, if not most, existing com
panies have slender possibilities of sue
in finding oil in the territories they
have grabbed for luck, but oil is not what
they are aft- r as much as selling stock, of
course. The same may be said of the av
erage stock buyer. He is simply a gam
bler, and if he hopes his company will
strike oil it is because his stock will go up
and not because he wants to draw divi
dends from the sales of oil. It Is the same
spirit that ruled the Comstock, where a
stock that hadn't paid dividends in years,
if ever, was about as good as any other to
gamble on. This, of course, does not ap
ply to many legitimate oil companies
which own producing territory or promis
ing territory being exploited on business
principles.
A large number of these companies will
put down wells and a few will develop
I profitable producers. Wells are going
; d'jwn all through the coast count:
well as in the San Joaquin Valley, and if
! 1 out of 500 develops a producing field the
i oil production will be increased, whatever
! the luck to the others. Recently several
wells in the San Juaquin Valley have de
veloped small yields of oil which may be
' greatly increased at greater depths. The
: great amount of prospecting that will go
on while the boom lasts and people put up
their money will not fail to result in im
portant discoveries.
It seems probable that the oil produc
tion of ISS* of 2.376.000 barrels will be at
least doubled for 1599 with the already
greatly increased production, mainly in
; the Coallnga, Fullerton and Summerland
fields. The coming year promises a still
larger Increase. As the market for thi3
oil must be mainly found in California
fuel censumption. an Important problem
arises. Consumption not long ago over
' took the supply and prices Jumped at Los
Angeles from &5 cents to $1 25 and $1 40. If
production overtakes the Increasing de
mand a slump in prices will follow, giving
a further stimulant to consumption. As the
I largest part of the product in the different
I fields is delivered under contracts cover
ing a considerable time, oil prices are a
doubtful quantity. Some Fullerton oils
now sell at the wells at $1 30. The Coal
inga yield practically all goes under con
tract to San Francisco. The bulk of it is
taken by the sugar refineries, the gas
works, the Southern Pacific Company, the
Selby Smelting Works, the Giant Powder
Works, and a few other larg-e industries,
which pay from $1 25 to $1 40 per barrel,
delivered. The fuel value of crude oil va
ries with the oil, the conditions of use,
etc.. but at an average three barrels of
! crude California petroleum are equal to
; one ton of good $6 or $S steam coal in a
furnace. The economy Is thus large, and
there is room for an enormous eonsump
! tion of oil in California, where cheap fuel
i is the chief industrial need.
The Los Angeles oil field is showing a
' largely decreased production, amounting
j to about 75 .000 barrels a month, while dur
-1 ing IS9S its production averaged over 120,
--| 000 barrels a month. Present efforts to
; develop an r-xtension of the field may re
, suit in another increase.
But other fields are more than making
up for this falling off in the Los Angeles
field. The Coalinga field is now produc
ing more than the Los Angeles field ever
did. The Summerland field is shipping
more oil than ever before. New wharves
are going out into the sea. from which
j strings of new weils will be drilled to the
oil sands below the ocean bed.

load of 35 tons, with the following results:
Ikadsuchi. 31.32 knots: Inadsuma 31.037
knots; Akebone 31.08 knots, and Sazan
ami 3LBB knots. A fifth boat of the same
type namr-d the Obero was launched from
the Yarrow yard on October 5. with steam
up and read; to .^tart on her trial in a few
days.
The French naval estimates for II**)
show an increase of about $2,280,000 over
the present year's appropriation and
amount to 163,000,000. Of this sum $24,000,
--000 is for nava] construction, including
armament and torpedoes, and $18,8
is set aside for completing: new ships,
hulls and machinery. The latter object
is $21,650,000 for the present year, Indicat
ing: that the navy department has under
taken more work than it has been able
to complete and only $907,600 is estimated
for beginning new construction.
The British cruiser Talb^t. attached to
the North America and West India sta
tion, recently passed through a four-hour
trial under natural draught and averaged
19.3 knots. Subsequently she made the
voyage from Barbadoes to Port Royal, a
distance of 1,040 miles, in 62 hours, averag
ing 16. S knots. The Tnlbot is a sheathed
cruiser of 5.600 tons, launched at Deven
port in 1<95, and made 20 knots under
forced draught on her first commission
trial. From her recent performance it
would appear as if the ship, after four
years' service, has not deteriorated to any
appreciable extent, for KM knots sea speed
maintained for two and one-half days
compares favorably with her Initial trial
performance.
The battleship Ocean returned to Ports
mouth dock-yard October 6, after an un
successful trial over the measured mile
under four-fifth^ power. The engines
developed 10,303 horsepower, which was
up to requirements, but the speed was
only 15H knots by the log, and two knots
short of anticipation. The ship was there
fore taken In hand by the yard authori
ties to be docked and the causes of fail
ure to be ascertained and remedied. A
sister ship, the Goliath, passed through a
thirty-hour four-fifth power trial, and
her engines developing 10.413 horsepower,
gave a speed of 17.3 knots by the log.
These battleships are Intended to develop
13,500 horsepower and a speed of 18. <o
knots under full power.
The Russian armored cruiser Gromo
boy, building at the Baltic works, St.
Petersburg, will carry no less than 64
guns of all description?, including four B
inch, sixteen 6-inch, twenty 3-inch (12
pounders), twenty 3-pounders, and four
machine guns, the entire lot being quick
firers. The vessel is wood-sheathed, of
12.336 tons, fitted with 35 Belleville boilers,
developing 18,000 horsepower, which will
give a sea speed of 20 knots. Her dimen
sions are 4V'^ feet length over all, 6-S l^
feet beam and 86 feet draught, and her
coal capacity is 2,500 tons, sufficient for
19,000 knots steaming at 10 knots an hour.
The water-line belt is 6-inch Harveyized
steel. 354 feet in length by 6 feet depth,
which, toÂ«"Â»*her with the armor, offers
protection for the engines against any
guns up to 12-inch caliber.
Rapid progress 1? made in the b-:
of the two battleships Duncan and i
wallls at the Thames iron Works, London.
They are an improved type of the form
idable class of three now completing and
being 1,000 tons less displacement and of
five feet more length. with six
inches more beam, will have considi i
finer lines than the Formidable, Implac
able and Irresistible. The new ships are
405 feet In length, 75 feet 6 Inches bpam
2Â«i feet <5 inches draught on an even keel,
displacing 14,0CÂ»t tons, with 900 tons of coal
on board. The water-line belt is of 7
lnch Harveyized Bteel for a distance of
SO feet in the body of the ship, whence it
tapers to three inches at the ends, and
the armament consists of four 12-inch
guns, mounted in pairs in 11-inch bar
bettes, 12 6-inch in 6-inch casements, of
which eight are on the main deck and
four on the upper deck. The auxiliary bat
tery embraces twelve 12-pounders, six 3
pounders and four submerged torpedo
tubes. The engines are to work up to
18.0 GO horsepower, the steam generating
in 24 Bellville boilers, with an initial pres
sure of 300 pounds. The trial spÂ»ed Is
to be 19 knots, and expected to realize 18
knots sea speed.

Mrs. PtnÃham's Advice Saved
Mrs. Hayes From an Operation.
[LETTEB TO MES. riNKHAM NO. 64,283]
* 4 Dear Mrs. PiNKHAiiâ Words cannot
express my thanks to you for your kind
advice to me in regard to my health, I
had been running- down in health for
about seven years. I had doctored
with good doctors and taken a great
many patent medicines. My trouble
began when my first child was born.
I had a very hard time and after its
birth would have severe flooding spells.
"After my second child I had very
good health until last winter when I
again became pregnant and suffered
very much and miscarried. I came
very near dying, and the doctor said I
i must have an operation, which fright-
! ened me very much, and concluded to
write to you for your advice, and take
your medicine. Was troubled with the
! whites, great pain in back and hips,
I sometimes when lying down or sitting
j was unable to get up. Would have
i such pain in groins could hardly walk.
" I can say I have never seen any-
! thing so wonderful as Lydia E. Pink-
ham's Vegetable Compound and Sana-
tive Wash. Your remedies have done
i wonders for me. Hoping that many
of my suffering- sisters may be led to
take your metffcine from reading this
letter, I remain, sincerely yours, Mrs.
Mary Hayes, Habdixsburg, Ky."
Letters like the foregoing should
convince everyone that Mrs. Pinkham's
i advice is certain help.

OVERDUE SHIP
CHAS. E. MOODY
REACHES PORT
At Honolulu When
the Ohio Sailed.
WENT VIA CAPE OF GOOD HOPE
rehtsttrance gamblers made
MONEY ON THE DEALu
â¢
Underwriters Paid 65 Per Cent to
Avoid Their Risks â British. Ship
Falls of Clyde Granted Ha
waiian Registry.
â¦
The American ship Charles E. Moody,
cm which 65 per cent was paid to reinsure
hull and cargo, arrived in safety at Ho
nolulu on October 26. The owners and
underwriters had grave fears for the
safety of the vessel, but the ship cap
tains along the front always asserted that
she would reach Hawaii In safety. In
consequence there was considerable
gambling on the result, and one broker
said yesterday that the insurance people
will have to pay $20,000 to different San
Francisco men who backed the ship.
Captain Anderson, the owner of the ves
sel, 1b out about $5000 on the long voyage
of the Moody. She is a splendid vessel
and well found throughout, so when she
left Norfolk, Va., on April 19 he had not
a cent of insurance on her. When the
months rolled by and there was no news
from the *hip ne began to feel uneasy,
but still showed his confidence in Captain
Woodsida and the craft by refusing to in
sure. When the Moody was 170 days out,
however, he changed his mind and paid
the underwriters at the rate of 00 per cent
to insure his Interest In the vessel and
cargo.
Among those who made "a killing" on
the overdue Bhip was Captain Giimore of
the Servla. He knows the vessel well and
when the' rate went to 65 per cent he in
vested considerable money and will now
j reap the reward of his judgment. Cap
\ tain James H. Bruce, Captain Horriman
j and Captain Blair always maintained
that the Moody would go to Honolulu
by way of the Cape of Good Hope and
; backed their opinion to the extent of sev
| eril hundred dollars. When the trans
i part Ohio reached port yesterday morn
i ing It was learned that Captain Wood-
I side had taken his ship via Good Hope
â  after failing to round the Horn.
Light winds and calms and a Japanese
I crew were responsible for the long voyage
'of the ship. When she left Norfolk sne
had fifteen Japanese and tlve white men
before the mast. Ship masters say that
on a sailing vessel It takes three Japanese
to do one ABa work. In that event the
Moody was handicapped to a very great
extent. Captain Woodslde in his report
s;i\s they were the most stupid lot ot
men he tver had to deal with. On May
13 Adolph Plckert, an AJ3, and three Jap
anese were out on the jibboom stowing
the sail. By some means or another Pick
ert fell overboard, but the Japanese
raised no outcry and finished their work.
About an hour aftel" the accident they
reported that Plckert was overboard. It
was then too late to do anything, as the
unfortunate sailor was lost.
The Moody reached Honolulu without
the loss of a sail. The officers of the
Ohio say sh>' looked as dean as a new
pin and showed no traces of her long
voyage. In making Honolulu by the
route he tonk Captain Woodside sailed
over 3.". 000 miles, while Norfolk is less
than &>io miles In a direct line from Ha
waii. The vessel has nearly SiXfO tons of
coal aboard for the Government and after
discharging it she will probably go to Pu
get Sound In ballast.
The transport Ohio brings news
that the Circuit Court of Hawaii has
made a peremptory order to tho Collector
of Customs at Honolulu to issue a cer
tificate of registration to the British ship
Falls of Clyde. The big: vessel is now
lying: at Howard street wharf, loaded for
Hllo. She was purchased in San Fran
cisco several months ago by Honolulu and
San Francisco parties and a Hawaiian
registry \v;is applied for. The Collector
of the Port of Honolulu refused to give
the vessel what was asked for and the
owners carried the matter into court,
with the result that the F;ills of Clyde is
now entitled to fly the Hawaiian nag.

As far ns accidents or special Incidents
wr-ra concerned yesterday was a quiet day

sequence the police did not find it neces
sary to make an arrest during the day.

is lying at Main street wharf getting an

coming to them for fear all hands would
desert in a body. Said one of. them yes
terday:
"Our captain has discovered a new way
to prevent desertion. Last pay day sev
eral of the crew ran -away as soon as they
got "their pay, and the captain is pre
venting a repetition of the exodus by
withholding our pay. We asked him yes
terday when we were going to get paid,
and he told us none of us would get our
money until the ship went back to her
anchorage in the bay. Then shore liberty
is to bestopped and our pay will be no
good to us. Resides, it may be a fort
night before we go out in the stream. If
we were only treated properly there would
be no desertions, :md, consequently, no
need for such measures as our captain is
taking. Instead of being auoard a United

a deepwater packet, where desertions are
the rule and not the exception."

The boiler procured by the Steam Whal

MAYOR PHELAN
STATES THE ISSUES
What Success Will Signify.
Tn view of the false issues raised and
persistently advocated, I desire to say
that I and my colleagues will construe
our success ut the polls as an indorse
ment of our official acts and the policy
we have established In expelling bossism
and corporate control from the City Hall,
and also as a rebuke to the gentlemen
who are seeking to destroy the principal
feature of the new charter, which, in re
quiring city elections separate and dis
tinct troni national elections, designed to
Insure ;i dispassionate business discussion
of local affairs uninfluenced by mere par
tisan zeal, which in the past has carried
men intu office without respect to their
honesty or limess, to the great injury of
our city.
1 believe with the true and disinterested
friends of the charter that separate mu
nicipal elections are necessary for good
municipal government, and I ask the
people, by their votes, to determine their
policy in this respect. If the attempt to
force national issues into city elections is
not rebuked at this time, the great bene
fits of the charter will be lost.
Notwithstanding false, statements to the
contrary, the bi-partisan boards and the
civil service provisions give no party ad
vantage to either side in the matter of
patronage, which the charter has wisely
destroyed, unless the Mayor proves false
to his 'oath of office. The Mayor has but
thirty-three direct appointments. Civil
service rules regulate the appointment of
all the others, and the present members
of the School, Police and Fire depart
ments are secured In their positions by
the charter on good behavior, and cannot
be removed without cause after a trial.
If elected I will be loyal to the charter
and endeavor to firmly establish Its prin
ciples and with least friction Introduce
the reforms which it contemplates, acting
wholly In full sympathy and accord with
its purposes and objects.

IV. KING LEAR.B
Sketch of the Opening Act.
L.ear, King of Britain, had three daugh
ters â Gonerll, married to the Duke of Al
bany; Regan, married to the Duke of
Cornwall, and Cordelia. Being advanced
in years and anxious to disburden himself
of the cares of state, he had divided his
kingdom into three portions, with the in
tention of conferring one on each of his
daughters and spending his remaining
days in ease and retirement. But he was
a man of somev.iat unstable character,
liable to sudden whims, and all at once
he took it into his head to upset the ar
rangement hÂ© had already made and to
give the larger share of his kingdom to
the daughter who should convince him
that she loved him best. The three
princesses, being called upon to prove
which had the best title to the largest
share, the two elder sisters were profuse
in their expressions of affection, but Cor
delia, who loved nothing better than
truth, could not be prevailed upon to
share In the exaggerated protestations of
her sisters, and declared that she loved
SHAKESPEARE'S CLIFF, DOVER.
her father as her duty bound her to do
and no more. The old King, in a violent
rage at this behavior of his youngest
daughter, divided his kingdom equally be
tween Goneril and Regan, and utterly dis
inherited Cordelia. Two suitors for Cor
delia's hand were then present at the
court, the Duke of Burgundy and the |
King of France, They had come In the j
expectation of receiving a handsome
dowry with the lady, and Lear now
turned to them and asked whether they
were still willing to take her in her pres
ent penniless and disgraced condition. The
Duke of Burgundy, to whom the offer was
first made, declined to take a dowerless
wife, but the King of France, believing
that she was a dowry in herself, gladly
accepted her hand and took her home
with him as his Queen.
Lear was to retain the title only of
King, without the authority, and, attend
ed by a train of a hundred knights, was
to divide his time equally between the
houses of Goneril and Regan, spending a
month at a time with each. Not only did
the hundred knights prove to be exceed- j
ingly troublesome and disorderly inmates j
j of the household, but their master him
self, forgetting his part of the compact,
acted as If he still possessed the royal
authority which he had given away, and
I Goneril, with whom he was spending the
j first month, soon grew tired of such un- |
ruly guests. Lear concluded to rely on the '
! affection of his second daughter and sent
a letter to Regan to announce that he i
would be with her immediately.. The j
bearer of this letter was the Earl of Kent, j
the most loyal and devoted subject that
Lear had possessed. Lear had banished |
him from the kingdom for taking the part j
of Cordelia, but his loyalty could not be
checked by this, and he had now joined j
his old master again, disguised as a ser- I
vant.
Noteâ This sketch Introduces some of the i

Critical Study of the Play.
"King Lear" Is the universal tragedy of
human ingratitude, or, in the more lim
ited sense, of filial ingratitude. Wherever
there is a father whose doting fondness
outruns his discretion, whose desire for
filial approbation blinds him to the con
sequences of his paternal folly; wherever
there is a mother who prematurely re
signs into her daughter's hands the sway
of her household and sacrifices her own
dignity as its head, there the eternal
tragedy of Lear is on the point of being I
re-enacted. For the human heart is by
nature greedy of power, of e*ase, of defer
ence from others; and It is only held In
check by the bends of duty, by respect of !
established authority, by awe and rever- j
ence. That which distinguishes the world
of man from the world of the brute or the
vegetable creation is certain sacred in
stincts, potential at first and afterward
reinforced by the institutions of human
society. The adolescent oak hesitates not j
to draw its sustenance from the parent tree
lying prone at its feet; the king of the
wolf pack is devoured by his fierce sub
jects the moment he falters and suc
cumbs; even In certain savage tribes <.he
aged man, though a chief, is likely to fall,
as a useless incumbrance, under the
stroke of the warclub or to be led aside
to die In silence of consuming hunger.
Note how Shakespeare finds a telling
phrase for this:
The barbarous Scythian, ;
Or he that makes his generation messes .
to gorge his appetite.
Wherever mankind is but Just emerging
from barbarism, the awe that encircles
like a halo the hoary head is likely to |
prove insufficient to deter the parricide j
from invading the life from which he
drew his own; and wherever, in periods
when law is weak and order troubled, so
ciety seems reeling back into brutish
shamelessness and anarchy, there the
family is likely to present an epitome of
the moral chaos which threatens the very
framework of the world. Under such cir
cumstances, to use Shakespeare's own
words In another play: ?'^;' :
Strength should be lord of imbecility.
And the rude son should strike his father dead;
Force should be right; or. rather, right and
wrong.
Between whose endless jar Justice resides.
Should lose their names, and so should justice,
too.
, Then everything includes itself in power,
Power into will, will into appetite;
And appetite, a universal wolf.
So doubly seconded with will and power,
Must make perforce a universal prey.
And last eat up himself.
To this condition society is ever tending
to revert, and it requires the strenuous
and constant efforts of every lover of his
kind to hold it suspended . above the
abyss, to urge it upward toward the
sphere of heavenly influence, aware
[ though, he may. be that at Its best estate
It can only hang In unstable equilibrium,
like a wheel on an eccentric axis, ready
to Bwlng back toward the earth under
the weight of its own base proclivities.
The sanclty that invests the infant, the
blameless octogenarian, and the patient
domestic animal, the tender solicitude
which protects and cherishes those who
are unable to Oefend themselves against
injuryâ those arf plantÃ which need con
tinually to ho watered with celestial dew
and which are soon choked out of exist
ence by the rank weeds that flourish with
tropical luxuriance in the untended gar
den of the human heart
It Is by an unerring Instinct that
Shakespeare has preserved the barbarlo
conditions which form the natural settings
for this crime against humanity, Just as,
by an instinct equally unerring, Vour
genieff has placed his Lear of. the Steppes
in the deml-savagery of peasant Russia.
Balzac In his "Pere Goriot" has attained
a similar though Inferior result by sur
rounding 'he hero of his sordid tale with
the refined bestiality of nineteenth
century Paris.
The Lear of Shakespeare la a crpaturÂ©
of impulse. He is a Celt, a Celt antedat
ing the Christian era by something like a
thousand years, a Celt who swears his
pagan gods In an epoch when the stars
could still be supposed without too great
absurdity to determine the destinies of
men. "Warm-hearted himself, he craves
the display of affection from those who
j are doubly bound to him as Prince and
father. His own emotions demand im
mediate and full expression, and grati
tude or love means nothing to him unless
It is demonstrative and eloquent In its
turn. The significant deed does not con
tent him; it must be accompanied or re
placed by flowery words. For this he
1 sets the pattern. 'When he divides his
kingdom it is with the swelling language
;of a pronunciamento; when his anger
; grows into vehement rage it expends It-
I self in Invective which might be called
j Ciceronian, were it not Shakespearean.
! His Judgment has always been weak and
j his rule unsteady; like others of Shake
speare's English monarchs, notably Rich
ard 11, he was born to be an orator or a
j poetaster rather than a King. He loves
I the trappings and appurtenances of
royalty; his aim has not been to serve his
people, but to enjoy his state, the pro
fessions of loyalty tendered by his cour
tiers, and the freedom to do and say
whatever comes into his head. Senility
| has but increased his Impulsiveness, his
I fondness for show, his impatience of any
! restraint; it has rendered insatiable his
; df-sire for homage and for the display of
j blind, unreasoning, overflowing affection.
j What a cMsappolntment he is preparing
| for himself when *he parts with his
j power, the only thing wnich has recon
j clled his court to bear with his arbitrary
i and changeful demeanor! He becomes es
j sentlally a private man, and from ti.at
I moment begins to reap what he has sown.
Impatient of discipline himself, he has
I never imposed it upon his daughters, and
I there is no reference to their mother,
! whom we may therefore suppose to have
died too early to supply this deficiency of
paternal training; he accordingly flnd3
himself confronted with sheer nature â
in the case of Goneril and Regan with
headstrong, lustful, cruel women, strong
I with the strength of the tigress, and
beautiful, if beautiful, with the gleam of
her eye and the litheness of her terrible
body; in the case of Cordelia, with a
stern uprightness and a dumb tenderness,
both of which he is incapable of compre
hending. It is with these that, practically
alone and unfriended, he finds himself
! face to face, for Albany, though sym
pathetic, is under the dominion of his
wife's imperious nature; Gloucester,
though pitiful. Is sufficiently occupied
j with the retribution for his own sins;
I Kent, though loyal, wanders In disguise
as an outlaw; and the Fool ruthlessly
chastises his master's follies, only tem
pering his sarcasm at times with the
tender reflexes of his adoration for Cor
delia, toward whom his sentiments are
like those of the huntsman for his lady
1 in Browning's "Flight of the Duchess."
In this unequal contest Lear is bound to
succumb. The kingdom of hi? soul, which
has long been the prey to blind whim or
ungoverned passion, has now become ab
solutely chaotic, and Is accordingly no
match for the steady purposes and con
stant wills to which It is opposed. He
is thrust out by calculating and insistent
selfishness, and eventually succored by
unwavering affection; his own impulsive
and fickle nature is but the football of to
and-fro contending forces, and the only
majesty which he retains to the end Is
that of fitful passion and ruinous age, the
majesty of a dismantled tower played
round by wild lightning.

Hot S.ickwork Results in a
Wa ! loping to the
Dudes.
Oakland 2, Sacramento 5.
In the language of the street, the Dudes
had it put on 'em yesterday morning and
afternoon, and the Senators did the trick.
The game on this side at the bay was
easy going for the Statesmen and hard
up-hill climbing for the Brummels.
After the second and third Innings there
was nothing to the afternoon game but
the Senators viewed through the small
end of a telescope and the Dudes seen
from the- reverse end. The tlrst Inning
passed off without a killing, but when the
next period began the Sacramentans
swelled with a desire to show their stick
ability.
Stanley worked a double-bagger and a
single by Shanataan hurled him over the
rubber. Then Sheehan rapped out a hit,
followed by Stultz, who dropped a fly that
was much like the gentle rain from
heaven; into Hardies its. Hardie polite
ly dropped the ball and Shanah&n scored.
In the third Harvey made the first bag
on a hit, stole second; went to third on
Q'Conner's hit and scored when Eagan
rolled out a safe- one. Eagan went to the
second siding on Doyle's out and scored
on a hit by Sheehan. In the fifth Stanley
went to lirst on an honest hit, second on
Doyle's out and crossed the plat when
Sheehan rapped out a safe one.
Oakland's two runs were made in the
fourth and sixth. Hammond took first
on four bad balls, second on Hardies out,
third on a similar performance by Moski
inan. crossing the rubber on Dunleavy'a
hit. In the sixth Hutchinson received the
ball on the chest, but he died at second,
when forced out by Hammond, who made
first in safety, stole second and third,
cantering home on a passed ball.
Harvey pitched a remarkably good
game, but Harper was hit frequently.

MORNING GAME.
Oakland 2. Sacramento 6.
Fireworks of the lurid kind were seen
during the morning game at Oakland.

subject of a railroad accident,
and six ripe and fulsome errors by the
Dudes gave Sacramento an easy victory.

two-bagger, took third on O'Connor's hit,
scoring on Dunleavy's error of Ham
mond's throw to second to catch O'Con- j
nor, The second inning brought Oakland [
a run. With two men cremated, Shana
han dropped Borchers' liner to center.

mento. Shanahan making first on a hit
and scoring on Stultz's three-bagger. In

BELLE CLAIR WINS
AT SAN MATEO PARK
Belle Clair, a member of a prreat family
of greyhounds, won the open stake clev
erly at San Mati ng Park yester
day. In the final shÂ»' led Hummer an in
dt-nnltf number of lenpthp. never Ii
the result in doubt, in a long course.
ciair- â  opponent during the day
was little Lavender. Belle Clair led to
the hare, and from that on they worked
siilp by side. Toward the end Lavender
was doing all the work, but lost by a
score of 20 to 16 points.
i The course betveen Chicago Boy, an
other S.. Clalr puppy, and Green Valley
Maid was one of the finest scon on a local
field. The dogs first ran an undecided, for
which decision Judge Grace Jr. was loud
ily applauded. The second time out both
worked brilliantly, being to all appear
' ances well matched in the matter of
speed. Chicago Boy won, but the length
of the course overtaxed him and he was
drawn. In the previous round he put out
1 Crawford Lad, who was fancied for the
stake. The score in points was 7 to 5,
| while Crawford Lad was favorite at odds
I of 2 to 1.
Lady Clare defeated Young America In
1 the fourth round, the latter being favor
ite at odds of SMi to 1. Morning Glory beat
Royal Buck in the second round by a
score of 16 to 12. Hummer, the runner-up
! for the stake, had comparatively easy
I running, two of her trials being byes.
The attendance was the largest since the
opening day. The judging by John Grace
Jr. was first-class, his decisions being un
questioned throughout the day. He was
master of the situation at all times and
I easily lived up to all the pleasant things
said about him by his friends. Arthur
Mas Bey, the slipper, was unfortunate in
the course between Rustan and Belle
I Clair near the end of the stake. The dogs
were not slipped to the first hare and in
the struggle, before they could be quieted.
Kustan backed out of the Blip. A pro
; cession of relief dogs filed across the
field, but Rustan killed the hare. Ills
owner refused to run him at once, and
|he was given a rest while two other
courses were run. He lost, but the extra
course did not injure his chances. The

SAFE FROM WINTER STORMS.
Corinthian Fleet Passes Through the
Bridge Into thÂ« Lagoon
at Tiburon.
The Corinthian Yacht Club fleet has
folded ltÃ wings and gone Into winter
quarters until the opening of the yacht-
I ing Season of IM'io. Immediately after
the arrival of the 11 o'clock boat from
this city yesterday morning the bridge
into the lagoon at Tiburon was raised
and the passage opened. It was found
necessary to cut the telephone and tele
graph wires stretched above the bridge
before the yachts could pass in. Frank
Bartlett climbed the mast of the Queen
j and thence to th^ raised bridge to sever
, the wlr^p. This done, Paul Bibers
1 Mignon went through, followed by the
I Queen.
The following yachts entered the la
goon in the order named: Emma, Spray,
Merope, Clara, Paul, Diana, Aeolue,
Ceres, way, Cupid, Thelmu, Freda, Stel-
I la. Mischief, Truant, Phoenicia, Trio,
i Ella. Volunteer, Ollie, Venito, Presto,
Twilight, Wawona, Juanita, Villain,
; Rover. Edna and Seven Bells. The masts
had been taken out of the Aeolus and
Mtgnon. and all had been stripped of
their sails and equipments.
The foregoing list Includes several
boats not enrolled in the Corinthian fleet,
the owners of which took advantage of
; the "open door" to pass into the shel
: tared waters of the lagoon. About ten
j or twelve yachts still remain at anchor
in Belvedere Cove. The entire operation
1 yesterday occupied only a ehort time
Ity of the visitor, who seemed able t<<
pink the editor at will. At the conclu
sion of the exhibition Professor Tron
chet. dressed in a natty duck uniform.
made his appearance on the platform
and. before the cheering had subsided,
the professional opponents were facing
each other, foil In hand. At the word
"Allcz" they set to. At the third at
tack Tronchet was disarmed and In
t lie following onslaught broke h.s foil.
The Italian prof essional was in a merry
mood, while his opDonent was plainly
Irritated. Each ::me ironchet touched
the visitor, Pavese bowed gracefully to
the audience and cried "Tronchet,"
while the Olympian was disposed to
quibble over points made against him.
I Hiring one of the rallies, thinking he
had detected a foul, the baron Stepped
between the rivals and. with uplifted
sword, tried to stop thrm. He received
a blow on the top of his hend, which
cut a deep gash. His glasses were also
dislodged from his nose. At the con
clusion of the contest, he awarded the
decision to Tronchet, who had made
fourteen points against his opponent's
thirteen.
Then there was excitement. Pavese
grew red in the fa< -p. threw off his
glove, strode to the edge of the nar
row platform and in Italian excitedly
explained to his countrymen thnt In
had been robbed. Having lost the c >n
trst the Italian swordsman challenged
Tronchet to a broadsword contest and.
and not the slightest mishap occurred.
Pori Captain J. M. Keefe as usual su
perintended the arrangements. Some of
the arks were already in the lagoon, but
"i hers remain at their moorings In the
cove. A few yachts may remain in com
mission an.l be sailed occasionally during
the winter, but thÂ«- yachting season is
officially and actually closed.
DEATH CLAIMS A
SPORTSMAN OF NOTE
William McÃae, a Noted Duck Shot,
Succumbs to Tuberculosis
Contracted Last Summer.
William D. McÃae, or "Bill" McÃae, as
he was known to ; ,i] gunmen in this dis
trict, died Saturday under peculiarly dis
tressing circumstances. A year ago he
was In the most robust health, with vital
ity which seemed capable of withstanding
the assaults of any disease. He was
passionately fond of duck shooting, and
was accounted one of the best shots in
the State. In the pursuit of the pastime
he Joined the Black Jack Gun Club, which
has its preserves on Sherman Island,
where he spent much of his leisure time.
The gamekeeper at the preserve contract
ed tuberculosis and died last July. By
the irony of fate Mr. McÃae defrayed his
funeral expenses, little drramtng at the
tlmo thai he had been attacked by the
dread baccllll and that his days were
numbered.
McÃae failed rapidly, but would not give
in until he had one more day on the marsh
after ducks. When the season opened he
went to Sherman Island. After killing one
duck he was satisfied, and his strength
! then ebbed away rapidly.
McÃae was a generous man in the full
est meaning of the term. His purs, was
always open to his friends. While in the
field he invariably distributed his birds
among his less successful fellows. He
was for many years an employe of Mur
phy, Grant & Co., where he was a general
favorite among his fellow-workers.

In the Handball Court.
In consequence of the absence of Joe
nothing loth, the Olympian accommo
dated him. By this time the specta
tors wore ptnndlng on chairs, wildly
excited. Both men donned heavier
helmets and gloves and, armed with
broadswords, sot to work. There was
blood in their eyes and force in every
blow. Trunchet was whacked almost
Immediately three times on the body
with the flat of the sword and three
red welts are there to remind him that
he was in a contest. In return he
struck Pavese on head and body and
once 'in the glove. Tronehet and Pa
vese argued over the latter point and
Pavese began to harangue the crowd
again until Tronchet, disgur-tr-d, threw
off his hemlet and gloves and refused
to ro on.
EDmile Ortion and Emillo T^astreto
were t" have followed Tronchet, but
Professor Paveae refused to cross
swords with them. Pavese afterward
said That he touched Tronchet IS times
in the opening contest, and received
only two in return. Ho claimed that
Hi- Baron and Tronchet were "no
gentlemen," and had not treated him
fairly He reiterated his willingness
to meet Tronchet la mortal combat In
Montreal or Mexico, and nothing
would give him more pleasure, he con
tinued, then to put another nick in
his sword-handle, after giving the lo
cal man the coup de grace. He says
he has already killed two Frenchmen,
and would lik^ to make It a third.

SUCCESS OF RURAL
FREE POSTAL DELIVERY
Report of First Assistant Postmaster
General Tells of Work Done
in This State.
WASHINGTON. Nov. s.â The report of
First Assistant Postmaster General Heath
relative to rural free delivery was made
public to-night. It shows that there are
now fourteen routes In operation in Cali
fornia. Agent Annin writes from San
Fr.'incisco recommending the establish
ment of one throughout the San Joaquin
Valley. He further says that the routes
located In Santa Clara County have more
than Justified expectations, and that by
far the largest number of applications
for the establishment of the service wi!"
come from California. The success of the
s< rvi< c wherever established has created
a growing demand in adjacent sections
that the same facilities be extended them.
Now 12.250 people, covering an area of
1155 miles, are receiving their mail deliv
ery through this service. It is probable
that the coming Congress will be asked
by the Postoffice Department for a large
appropriation for this work.

JOHN C. KTRKPATRICK. Manager.JEWELER HOGG
MAY HAVE MET
WITH FOUL PLAY
Friends Claim He Was
Murdered.
HIS IDENTITY WAS LOStI
TERRIBLE ERROR OF "OME CITY
OFFICIAL.
Remains Were Buried in Potter's
lieid While Relatives Were
Searching for Him High
â¢ and Low.
Â«.
One of the most remarkable rases that
has ever called for police investigation In
this city has just come to light. William
Hogg; n well-known jeweler, who resided
at 124 Bush street, was pick* up Sun
day night a -week ago on a sidewalk In
one of the most thickly populate.! por
tions of the city, he passed through the
Receiving Hospital to the City and
County Hospital, where he died, as "John
Doe," his Identity having been lost in the
transfer. The body passed through the
hands of the Coroner Into those of an un
dertaker end was buried In Potter's Field,
while the relatives were searching the
city for the missing man.
Only by the merest accident was the
identity of the body discovered. It has
been exhumed and examined, and In ad
dition to the story of its buffetlngs luring
the past week, it Is possible that another
chapter, showing foul play, will be added.
In other words, the relatives are con
vinced that the official eyes under which
Hogg's body passed were not only crim
inally careless concerning his identity, but
they were closed to a bloody crime.
The case is one that, in any event, calls
for a most searching investigation. Why
this man. who was known at the Receiv
ing Hospital, should lose his identity
while being moved to the City and County
Hospital cannot be explained. The Cor
oner held no inquest, performing only tne
perfunctory duties sufficient to earn his
fees, turning the body over to J. Hogan.
the city undertaker. There Is no evidence
that any effort was made by the Coroner
to ascertain the identity of the body.
Now that the relatives of the dead man
have heard i t his fate. Coroner Hill has
decided that an investigation is necessary:
The appalling fact presents itself, from
the evlaencs surrounding this case, that
a man may be murdered in this city,
taken to a public institution, die there
and be burs**! as a pauper anu his slayer
go unpunished unless Ihe victim has
lvlatives who may interest themselves In
the case.
Hogg, who was (3 years old, left his
home .Sunday evening, a wet ago, to
visit his uncle; B. M. West of 1211 Bush
street; with whom he had an engagement
to play whist: On his way he stopped at
the saloon of C. G. Ault at the
corner of Fine and Hyde streets,
where he collected 50 cents due him
f>>r repairing a clock. He spent the
money there and left the place, accord
ing to the story told by those who fre
quent the resort. Some time later he vas
brought back to the place by John Nixon,
who claimed that he had found the man
lying in iront of the home of Police Com
missioner (jiinst, corner of Bush and Hyde
streets, in a semi-conscious condition.
The ambulance was summoned and
Hogg taken to the Receiving Hospital,
where Nixon gave his correct name. The
patient was badly bruised about the head
and body. Monday morning he was re
moved to the City and County Hosp'ta!.
where he was registered as John Doe. He
died the same day. An autopsy was per
formed :it the hospital and, as a result,
the physicians certified that death was
due to cerebral apoplexy. On this state
ment the Coroner held no inquest, and
after keeping the body at the Morgue for,
two days, had it buried in the potter's
Held.
The disappearance of Hogg might have
remained a mystery had not the aged
mother, as a last resort, inquired at the
Morgue if there was any information
there of her son. The officials showed her
a picture of "John Doe" :md she readily
identified it as a photograph of Hogg.
This happened Saturday. Yesterday the
remains were exhumed and will be kept
at the Morgue until the inquest is held
next Thursday.
The relatives are strongly suspicious
that the dead man met his injuries' in
the saloon from which he was taken to
the Receiving Hospital. The people who j
frequent the place add somÂ« color to the
suspicion by their reticence to discuss the j
affair. The proprietor kept in the shade J
last evening and could not be inter- j
viewed.
It is also stated that while the assault
occurred about 7 o'clock in the evening
the ambulance was not called until some
hours later. John Nixon, who claims that
lie found Hogg in front of the Gunst resi
dence, was formerly a police officer, but
was discharged from the force and Is now
a barkeeper in the saloon.
Donald Bruce, editor of the Political
Record and stop-brother of the deceased,
insists upon an investigation. He sus
pects foul play as the cause of the man's
death and believes that something hap
pened in the saloon from which Hogg
was taken that was instrumental in
bringlnar about fatal results. At the
M'irguo last night ho made this state
"The appearance of Hogg's body after
I had caused It to be exhumed Is my
strongest ground for suspicion of foul
play. The face and upper portion of the
body had evidently been badly beaten,
causing rapid decomposition and nearly
obliterating the features. Hogg drank
very little, so far as I know, and he was
seldom 111.
"When I went to the saloon at the
corner of Hyde and Pine streets this
evening to inquire Into the facts leading
up to t ii j cause of death, the people with
whom I had conversation seemed very
reticent, and I believe withheld a greater
part of the Information. Their actions
were decidedly suspicious, and I desire
the police to make further Inquiry. I
understand that Nixon, who it la claimed
brought Hogg back to the saloon from
the corner of Bush and Hyde streets,
was very friendly with the man who is
now deceased. I. have also learned that
aftiT Hfj"Â« was taken to the saloon in
a semi-conscious condition he was al
lowed to r^mai.i there for some hours be
fore an ambulance was called."
Upon thp demand of Bruce and the
other rein lives of H -.- Coroner Hill de
cided to hold an inquest Thursday on the
body. He Informed tho police last night
of me matter and detectives will be de
tailed to clear up the mystery of prob
able murder and temporarily lost
Identity.
The body was finally procured by an
undertaker and exhibited to the relatives.
From its appearance it Is suspected hat
the corpse had been sold to some medical
college, as it looked as though it had
been preserved In some solution.

"ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA"
THE TOPIC OF DR. RADER
A large congregation filled the Third ',
Congregational Church last evening to :
listen to the Rev. William Rader deliver j
the first of a series of sermons on j
"Cardinal Truths and Passions, as Illus- j
trated by Shakespeare." The following is i
a synopsis of his address on "Antony and j
Cleopatra," the nrst subject of the series, i
"The Wages of Bin Is Death":
Literature grows out of life. It is the mlr- |
rcr not the convex nor the concave, but the j
level mirror of human experience. In Shakes-
peare we see the whole lives of men.
The truth of the Bible history and expert- ;
ence, that the end of sin is death, is illustrated ,
In the tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra. ,
which Shakespeare derived from Plutan-n. |
Cleopatra the most fascinating woman of her
times, was loved by Julius Caesar when tint
a golden-haired girl. When siie mrt Antony \
she was ut the height of h?r power. The alll- ;
ance of Antony and Cleopatra resulted In the j
ruin of tho great Roman, nd their history
proves that the wages of sin is death.
â \Vorldltness Is the world's chief sin. It is
man's short cut to happiness and Is forbidden i
because incompatible with the love of God.
DR. MACKENZIE SAYS THAT
CITY AND NATION ARE ONE
"As Is the city, bo Is the nation," was ;
i the text of a strong sermon by Dr. Mac- |
i kenzie of the First Presbyterian Church
last evening. Dr. Mackenzie dwelt on the ]
! necessity of an awakening of good citi- ;
1 zens in municipal atfairs, and referred to !
{ the home, the city and the nation as one .
!In interest. "One of the great principles
j of life set forth In tile Bible." said he, "is
i that if city life. 'God made the country
; and man and the devil made the city,' is
I half a truth and half a lie, for the city is
in God's plan. The destiny of mankind
lies in the city. We will always be con
fronted with the problems of city gov
ern m c nt.
"As the home is, so is the city; as the
city, so the nation: the three are one. |
The danger to our republic lies in the in
terior municipal life of our cities. It does
not lie in bosses or bosslsm. Bosses are i
necessary in thHr way and the pastor of i
this church is a boss to a limited extent, j
but what can he do without the moral
support an backing of responsible peo
pie. We as Christian citizens cannot
shirk this responsiblity."

time was spent al Guam. Captain Leary, Governor of
Guam, dined â  n board the transport and reported every

quarters on board the yosemite, but was making prep

CALVARIAN SOCIETY MEETS.
Father Charles A. Ramm Preaches at
the Annual November Open Ses
sion at St. Mary's Cathdral.
The- annual November open meetlnp of
the Calvarian Society was held yester
day at St. Mary's Cathedral. The cathe
dral waa filled by the members, who par
ticipated in the beautiful and impress've
services of tho "Way of the Cross." Dur
ing the stations the Choir sang the "Sta
bal Mater." At the conclusion of this
service they sang "Jesu Dei Vivo." by
Verdi, and after the sermon, the "Aye
Maria." of Lorets.
Rev. Father Charles A. Ramm preached
the sermon. Ho Bpoke on the communion
Of saints and gave practical applications,
both personal and with reference to the
society. H<- dwelt on the fundamental
fact that prayer Is the essence of all re
ligion; that It. forms a bond of union, for.
In the Hible. Christians are directed to
pray for one another. His address term
inated with an admonition to the mem
bers of the society on the duty of prayer.
During the benediction, the choir sang
"O Salutaris," by Rospini, and the "Tan
tum Ergo." The music was by the reg
the firing line around lmus and Bacoor, but for
the most part they were doing garrison duty in Cavite
and Manila. On January 3" Elmer Honymun, a farrier,
and Private William Bruce secured a pass to enter the
Filipino lines and wt-rt- made prisoners. Their names
were afterward found scratched on the walls of the
prison at San Isidro. Those two and Private Andrew
Michaelson, who died of typhoid fever, were the only men
lost by the Nevada troops during the campaign. Lieu
tenant Glgnoux was transferred to the Eleventh Cavalry
Just before the troop sailed for home, and Second Lieu
tenant Wright succeeded him. while Sergeant G. H.
Freeman was made second lieutenant. Thirty-nine mem
bers of the trooj- secured their discharges at Manila
and remained in the islands.
Surgeon Thomas 6. Low, I. S. A., attached to the
Ohio, reports very little sickness and none of a serious
nature on the voyage. The vessel was not crowded and
there was no complaint on that score, but there was the
usual kick about the quality of the food served to the
men, especially among the discharged soldiers, who de
clared that they were only allowed half rations.
The Ohio brought back two naval prisoners and two
stowaways, the latter getting aboard al Hongkong. The
transport will be docked at G o'clock thia morning and
the Nevada soldiers will march out to the Presidio,
where they will remain until mustered out. The majority
of the discharged soMlors were allowed to come ashore
yesterday. Captain BoggÃ of the Ohio was rather sur
prised to loam that the Indiana, with the Tennessee
Regiment on board, had not .arrived, for, although the
Indiana had not sailed when the ' ihio cleared, she was
expected to sail at once and the general expectation was
that she would be In fean Francisco before tho Ohio.

W. H. BAGLEY DIES
AFTER AN OPERATION
IK the death of William H. Bagley
at the Lane Hospital yesterday
the Bohemian Club loses one of its
most popular and genial members,
and the business world a brilliant and
successful man, whose career has been
prematurely cut short.
Mr. Bagley had been In delicate
health for some, time and about ten
days ago was removed to the Lane
Hospital at Webster and Clay streets,
where ill?' complaint developed into
appendicitis. His condition became fo
critical that it was decided to operate
and on Friday afternoon this was done.
Owing 10 his weak state at the time
the patient failed to rally under the
operation and gradually sank until at
1:30 ]>. m. yesterday, he breathed h's
last.
William H. Bagley was a native of
Oregon, where he resided up to s'.x
years ago, when he came to San Fran-
Cisco c.nd engaged in the insurance
business. At the time of his last 111
--ness ho was general agent of the
, North British Mercantile Insurance
Company, and was regarded d>- his
confreres as one of the most progres
sive men in the Insurance business.
An incident full of pathos connected
with his death was his recent engage
ment to Miss Grace Currier, one of
Denver's most prominent society wo
men. Mr. Bagley and Miss Currier
were to have been married very soon.
A message has been sent to his rela
tives to find out their wishes in regard
to the funeral.
tor and motorman were the only persons
on the car. The highwayman covered
them with a ritlo ana compelled them to
hand ov.-t their money, amounting to $12
and their witches, He then started to
ward the woods.
FRANCIS P. DEWEES DEAD.
Prominent Author and Politician of
Washington Passes Away.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 5.-Francis P.
Dewees died here to-day. He was As
sistant Attorney General from 1885 to
1893.
Mr. Dewees was widely known as an
author and a politician. He was for a
time an active member of the Greenback
party, but In 1880 a controversy arose be
tween him and General Weaver, the
party's candidate for President, with the
result that he went on the stump and ad
vocated the election of General Hancock.
From that time Mr. Dewees allied him
self with the Democratic party.

INDIANS FIGHT
TO THE DEATH
Frank Schneea Kills
Frank Fiores.
PLEASANTOX, Cal.. Nov. s.â ln a
drunken brawl in Indian Town, a small
hamlet in the foothills between Pleas
anton and Sunol, last night Frank
Schneea stabbed Frank Fiores, inflicting
a wound which resulted in the latter's
death early this morning. Fiores was a
half-breed, as is his slayer, and they had
always been friends.
Yesterday afternoon Schneea went to
Fiores' cabin and, in company with the
latter and several Indians, began drink
ing wine, which made them so drunk
j that they became quarrelsome. Fiores
j got into a difficulty with his wife tnd tried
to stab her. Schneea interfered and told
i him to put his knife away, in response
I Fiores told Schnena it was none of his
! business, and after a brief altercation,
| made a dash at him, knife in hand, and
] chased him out of doors. Seeing that he
! must defend himself. Sr.hneea drew his
j knife and stabbed Fiores under the left
I shoulder, inflicting a fatal wound.
News of the killing reached here after
I daylight and Deputy Coroner Toney
i Sweer brought the remains to this place.
j An autopsy held this afternoon disclosed
the fact that the brachial artery had been
severed. If a doctor had been summoned
promptly Fiores' life might have been
saved, but while he lay on the floor of the
cabin bleeding to death the orgio con
tinued and he expired. Schneea was ar
rested later in the day by Constable
I..ocke. He admits the stabbing-, but claims
j he acted In self defense. The other wit
nesses of the affair tell the same story.
An inquest will be held tomorrow after
noon.
BALLOT-BOX TO BE
CAREFULLY GUARDED
The Republican officers of election met
yesterday afternoon at B'nai B'rith Hall
to receive Instructions as to their duties.
A. B. Truman, chairman of the Republi
can Campaign Committee, called the gath
ering to order. He announced that it was
the desire of the Republicans that every
voter should be given an opportunity of
expressing his preferences at the polls and
that there should be an honest count of
the ballots. W. H. Rickard, deputy Reg
istrar, was introduced to explain the law
governing the election boards. His dis
sertation on the subject was concise, but i
extremely clear. He went into every de- j
tail of the law governing the election offi
cers, and after he had completed his dis- j
course spent much time answering ques
tions that had suggested themselves to
those who will assist in handling the bal- j
lots to-morrow.
Special stress was placed on the asser
tion that no receptacles for money or
i other donations would be permitted at
any of the booths.
"No leg-puliing will be permitted under j
any guise," said Mr. Rickard, "and we I
look to the Republicans to see that this !
provision of the law is carried out to the I
letter."
Of the important matters that were lm- |
pressed upon the election officers, and one ;
which the voters should bear in mind, is j
the fact that any writing on the official '
ballots, unless it is placed in the last col
â  umn. which is provided for that purpose, j
will invalidate the whole ballot and it will
;int be counted by the election board. If I
: a mistake is made in voting for the wrong ;
number of Supervisors, Police Jud
i other officers where there is more than j
one to be elected, the ballot will not be
| couriteu only in so far as it concerns the
I offices in which no mistakes are made.
All of the election bootns will be sup
plied with complete Instructions and dep
uty registrars will visit them from time
I to time on election day to straighten out
! any tangles in which the election officers
may become involved.
The Registrar has simplified things as
much as possible and the board that de
sires to do right will have but little diffi
| oulty in following the spirit of the cl p ctlon
law.
At the conclusion of the meeting Al. Bo
vler, chairman of the Republican commit
tee, made a brief address, lit- said that
â  much of the hoped-for success of the Re
publican party was in the hands of the
election boards and that with conscien
tious work on the part of the officers Da
vit* would be the next Mayor of San Fran
cisco. This announcement was received
with cheers. All through the meeting
those in attendance gave evidence of their
confidence and sincerity.
It was a gathering of Republicans, to be
sure, but it was not like the Democratic
â  meeting held for the same purpose* at Met
! ropolitan Temple. There were no cheers
â¢ there, no enthusiasm, no confidence, and
only faint hope. The Democratic officers
took their instructions and went home No
1 news of the political situation was given
out. and this was taken as an Indication
, that the leaders had nothing good to tell.
REGISTRAR IS ON TO
RUBBER STAMP SCHEME
The man who tries any crooked work at
the polls to-morrow will find himself in a
serious scrape. A Republican Registrar
has determined that the voters shall be"
given every opportunity to express their
preferences and that every possible safe
guard shall be placed around the ballot
box. The red rubber stamp scheme of the
friends of Phelan will not be tolerated.
Any man who attempts to carry It into
execution will be arrested and prosecuted.
Deputy Registrar Rickard sounded the
warning yesterday afternoon at the meet
ing of Republican election officers held at
B'nai B'rith Hall. He intimated that the
Registrar's office was fully cognizant of
the scheme exposed a few days ago in the
columns of The Call, and he cautioned the
officers present to be on the alert for any
one who attempted to circumvent the
election law with a rubber stamp other
than that provided in the booths.
"All you will have to do," said Mr. Rick
ard, "is to turn the offender over to an
officer. We will do tne rest."
In this connection the following official
notice issued by the Registrar is impor
tant:
All ballots must be marked with the stamp
(X) provided by the Registrar of Voters, or
the ballot will not be counted.
Any stamp (X) used, except the single rub
ber stamp With a cross (X) on e.aeh end fur
nished by the Registrar will make the ballot
illegal.
Persons using any other stamp (X) will be
arrested and prosecuted according to law.
J. STEPPACHER, Registrar of Voters.
LET THE MERCHANTS
TALK IT ALL OVER
Republican merchants who have not ful
ly made up their minds to vote for Horace
Davis should to-day carefully and fairly
review the political situation and take
into account the advantages which the
Democratic party would derive by the
election "f Phelan. The issue now at band
is between political parties. Mayor Phe
lan in addressing the people at Metropoli
tan Temple on the evening of August 4
uttered these words:
"We all have to be party men now. We
have to carry out reforms within the par
ty. We fill have to be party politicians;
we can't be independents go before
the people and say we will do tnus and so
We have to get behind the party, and
make it the instrument and the agency of
our work."
The Call stands reaÂ».y to prove by the
sworn testimony of an expert stenograph
er that Mr. Phe*an did utter these worda
He was addresstn- a Democratic audience
a few days before tin- primary â¢â¢lection
and did not suspect that The Call had a
stenographer posted to take down his ex
act language.
The San Francisco merchant should
therefore, ask himself to-day. "What
party shall I get behind?*' The issue is
above neighborly courtesy and personal
friendship. It involves principle and
touches the commercial position of San
Francisco. A man may entertain personal
liking for Phelan and yet condemn the
principles which he advocates. No doubt
at this particular time Phelan is eiving
the glad hand to weak Republicans but
whether elected or defeated he will enter
tain only reelings of contempt for Repub
licans who desert their party in this cam
paign.

MLLE. FIFI APPEARS
IN FLYING SKIRTS
The male element was predominant at
the opening nf the Alhamhra Theater last
evening, when "Mademoiselle Fiti" made
her debut in S;m Francisco. For those
who are able to read between the lines,
this preliminary remark will be sufficient
to guess at the character of the play. In
fad it is not exactly complimentary to
our male theater-troers when it is obvious
that a "Mademoiselle Fifi" and a "Turtle"
are able to attract them, while more re
fined performances are unable to gain
their patronage.
The stage is intended to illustrate the
various situations in our social system as
true to life as possible in a manner ele
vating in purpose. Therefore the good in
life should be made attractive, while the
bad should be presented as repulsiv-.
"Mademoiselle Fifi," therefore, cannot
claim the title of a work of art, for it
does not only intend to make the
licentious mode of living permissible,
but it actually makes it a means by which
to obtain a supposedly honest end. In
other words, according to this latest off
spring of French dramatic art. a man in
order to get a sort of sham divorce from
his wife for the purpose of obtaining cer
tain sums uf money, is allowed to accept
and return the attentions of a woman of
the demi-monde, and afterward live again
happily with his wife, whom he remar
ries, notwithstanding that the latter is
aware of his flirtation.
This play reminds me very much of a
sugared pill. Mile. Firi is the pillâ a very
bitter oneâ around which a sugar coating
of an exceedingly clever plot is laid. In
the first act you begin to sip the sugar,
for here is really dash and vim. The sec
ond act becomes bitter and the entrance
of Mile Fifi. fallowed by a vulgar love
scene, is the bitterest part of it all. In
fact, this music hall singer, who appears
in a semi-nude state â decollete, I mean â
is only introduced for the purpose of cre
ating a situation, which is best termed
"double meaning," and by means of which
those whose minds are susceptible to this
class of work ure attracted. As stated be
fore, the plot is excellent. Certain con
fusing situations arise from a plan to
gain a wife's money which cannot be se
cured unless the wife becomes single. An
excuse for a divorce is invented to de
ceive an objecting mother-in-law .and this
divorce is the axis around which the en
tire plot revolves. It is cleverly thought
out and the gradual development of the
play artistic. If there was only another
character for Fifi and not quite as sug
gestive a love scene the play might be
pronounced a clever comedy, somewhat
"Frenchy," perhaps, but clever, neverthe
less.
Nance O'Nefl reappeared last evening at
the California Theater In her farewell en
' gngement. She played Nancy Sykes in
; "Oliver Twist." The fierce temperament
I of this character makes it particularly
I adapted to Miss O' Nell' 8 dramatic talent,
and in consequence her audiences are de-
I lighted. It is a pleasure to find in this
drama tic desert an oasis where one can
refresh oneself at the spring of genius,
and the theater-going public of San Fran
, cisco should he grateful to Miss O'Neil for
i giving it some legitimate plays legitlmate
\ ly acted. This evening will be an event of
much importance at the California, as
Professor landau's new dramatic venture,
"The Shadow," will receive its maiden
production.
"The Sad Sea Waves" began their last
breakers yesterday. The specialties are
very much enjoyed, especially so the mv
i sical selections, which are much to the
credit of Gustave Laden, the musical di
rector. Next week the successful farce
. comedy, "Why Smith L<eft Home." will
| appear at the Columbia and will no doubt
attract all those who enjoy a real hearty
I laugh. ALFRED METZGER.
TROUBLE OVER CHARTERS.
Falls of Clyde Controversy to Go
Before the Supreme Court.
HONOLULU, Oct. 27.â Marshall Brown's
petition for a writ of mandamus against
the Collector General of Customs to com
pel the registration of the Falls of Clyde
will go before the Supreme Court despite
the proclamation of President McKinley
forbidding the further registration of ves
sels under the Hawaiian flag.
The recent decision of the Circuit Court
gave to petitioner the rights prayed for.
At that moment the President's proclama
tion came in. The Collector General is
now between the judgment of the court
and the President's proclamation.
The appeal is taken by Attorney General
Cooper to settle the predicament. It Is
necessary for the proclamation to go on
record in the case. It will then be for tua
court to decide whether it will consider
the merits of the contention or rule that
the proclamation settles the question for
aye.
Other cases of much the same char
acter-are pending. If the court accepts
the proclamation as indicated all of these
will undoubtedly be dropped from the rec
ords at once.
An interest in the ship Antiope has been
sold and the vessel will leave port for
the sound in a few days, the only matter
remaining to be settled being the claim
of Grace & Co. for "consequental dam
ages" on account of Captain Murray's re
fusal of a charter. Captain Murray has
been waiting here for many weeks, un
able to leave port on account of financial
entanglements and a threat of Grace &
Co. to libel the vessel for $3400. .;â¢-_ â¢-â  â 
The sale was consummated in San Fran
cisco and Captain Murray received news
of the close of the deal by the Australia.
The purchasers are San Francisco and
Honolulu people.

CONDITION OF
THE TREASURY
Country Prosperous and
Using More Gold.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 5.-Hon. Ellis H.
Roberts, Treasurer of the United States,
in his annual report to Secretary (iage,
sums up the operations of the last fiscal
year by saying that "a notable activity
was exhibited in all kinds of currency,
with a marked increase in the use of gold
coin and in a less degree of silver coin,
while the prosperity of the country has
at no time left any part of the Govern
ment notes in the treasury above the de
mands of daily business in its several
offices."
He says: The effect of the new revenue
law is shown in the receipts of the year,
in which there was an increase in 189S of
$56,563,419 from customs and $102,536,520 I
frum internal revenue. The collections of
internal revenue were larger than those
for any previous year, with the exception j
only of I^oo, and the total ordinary re
ceipts, which amounted to $515,9f>0,620, were
also the largest on record, with the same
exception.
The net ordinary expenses were a little
over $605,000,000, an amount exceeded only
twiceâ in 1863 and L 864. There was a defi
ciency of $85,111,659 in ordinary revenues.
Inclusive of loans and the issue of notes
and certificates the total receipts on all
accounts by warrants were $1,038,451J340,
and the total disbursements $964,222,148.
With tho addition of the proceeds of the
new 3 per cent loan to the ordinary reve
nues there was a fiscal surplus of $liki,
--791,521 for the year. The receipts from the
loan represented every part of the coun
try. Of the total of nearly S".iÂ»'i>" up
ward of $125,000,000 came to the office in
Washington in the form of checks on
banks in every part of the country. Near
ly $89,000,000 was paid in gold, upward of
$25,000,000 in United States notes and the
rest in other kinds of money.
By the improved revenues and the loan
: the treasury, notwithstanding the heavy
war expenses, will U- placed In the inde
pendent position so necessary to the
soundness of the financial system of the
country. The change was no less marked
In the aggregate of available resources
than isi their character, for the gain in
the total holdings was almost entirely In
gold and the treasury not only refused
tenders of gold in exchange for paper, but
increased the use of gold in the disburse
ments. At the dose of the year the
Treasurer" was accountable for $947.7
-t which he held $'.117,873,025 in cash
and cr.-iii t . the difference consisting of
funds classed as unavailable.
Aside from the issues of 3 per cent
bonds, the mosl Important event affecting'
the public debt was thi- falling due on Jan
uary l of the Vaje bonds issued
for the construction of Pacific railroads.
(if these â¢*K;.i | T". i "Â» were presented and
paid, leaving $79,000,000 of the loan out
standing, all past due and bearing no in
terest.
The gold coin in circulation, of denom
inations of $2n and under, steadily in
creased from $475.771.490 on September 30,
1596, to $646,561,185 on the same day in
1899. In the small notes there was a
shrinkage of $11,522,157 from 1896 to 1X97,
but in the next year there was an in
crease of $41,667,037, and from IS9B to 1S!)9
the amount ran up to $68,665,456. During
that year the increase of these denomina
tions of both gold and paper was $82,676,
--789. The total addition to the paper circu
lation in the same period was $101,839,641,
Of which $43,174,226 was in the large â le
nominations. The addition to the gnM In
circulation during the year was $23,911,373,
and this, added to the increase of ihe
paper outstanding, makes a total Increase
of $125,751,014.
In the fiscal year 1898, the ten treasury
offices paid out $40.532,H3 In standard sil
ver dollars, and in 1899 $42,582,296, an In
crease of $1,700,147. At the same time the
receipts of standard dollars were $54,007,
--934 in 1898 and $37,681,040 In 1899, a decrease
of $16,426,894. These changes Indicate a
growing circulation of these coins.
While disbursements of gold have been
heavy, the holdings of the Treasury in
din and bullion have surpassed all prev
ious records, both In gross amount and in
net excess over outstanding certificates.
The former gross maximum is found in
September, 18SS. at $832,561,906. and the net
maximum before 1898 was $218318,253 In
March of the same year. On June 30,
1898, i he gross gold in the Treasury was
$302,825,049 and the net $167,004,410. 'Those
figures rnse to $364,002,380 gross and $254,
--328.821 net September SO, 1899. These sta
tistics make plain a tendency tr> an in
crease in the use of coin of all kinds.
With reference to the appeals for notes
and certificates which the Treasury has
had to refuse, because it had already gone
to the limit of its powers, Mr. Roberts
Eoints out that the existence of national
anks In the United States have the right
under their charters to add $345,020,418 to
their circulation. Of this $29,181,680 would
go to the city of New York and $15.f<25700
to Chicago, from both of which places
there has been persistent applications to
the Tn-asury for paper. In face of the
assertion that the far Western States are
suffering for want nf currency, their own
banks could issue additional notes to the
amount of $18,285,246. The treasurer offers
no criticism upon the banks, but puts it
to them whether their sphere ends with
per cent fir Involves also an obligation of
service to the community.

WEATHER CONDITIONS AND GENERAL
J--| IRBCAST.
Generally cloudy weather prevails over TVa.Â«h-
Infton, Oregon and Western Montana and
partly cloudy in Central California; elsewhere
on the Pacific Slope fair weather prevail?.
The pressure has fallen quite rapidly along
the coa.-^t from San Francisco northward and
from Eureka north the winds have changed to
south and east, indicating the approach of a
storm off the Oregon coaqt. As yet the storm
is too far distant to definitely forecast its ex
tent or severity, but showers seem probable as
far south as Central California.
The temperature has remained about sta
tionary in all districts.
Forecast made at San Francisco for 30 hours
ending: midnight November 6, 1899:
Northern Californiaâ Partly cloudy in the
southern portion, cloudy in the northern por
tion, probably with showers Monday; brisk
southerly winds.
Southern Californiaâ Fair Monday; fresh west
winds.
N.'vadaâ Fair, becoming cloudy and threaten
ing Monday: warmer.
Utahâ Fair; warmer Monday.
Arizonaâ Fair Monday.
San Francisco and vicinityâ Cloudy and
threatening Monday, probably with Bhowers;

GLOOM SETTLES
OVER THE CAMP
OF PHELANITES
Disconsolate at Tid
ings of Defeat.
DAVIS' SUCCESS IS CERTAIN
CHEERFTTL ATMOSPHERE AT RE
PUBLICAN HEADQUARTERS.
Jleturns Trom All Sections of the i
City Indicate That the Battle
for Good Government Has
Been Practically Won.
THE feeling at the different politi
cal headquarters has a strong
Davis tinge. To judge from the
atmosphere that .surrounds the
Places from which the orders are
issued to the campaign workers
even-thing is going the Davis way. rwo
â¢ meetings were held yesterday afternoonâ
cno of the Republican officers of elec
tion and the other of the Democrats,
T.-ho will hold forth Tuesday in the elec- i
tion booths. At one the men took their
'instructions and went their way. At the
other thero was a feeling of confidence
and an expression of enthusiasm for the j
victory that seems certain for Horace |
Davis.
The Thelanites ore not happy. Some- I
thing has happened. They may be like
the old woman who attempted to sweep
the tide back with a broom. The tide j
of popular favor has set In for lloru.ee |
Davis and there does not seem to be any
Democratic way of heading it off. That
may account for the gloom that hovers
over the headquarters of the Pbelan
camp, and for the frosty atmosphere that
pervaded the- meeting: of Democratic elec
tion ollk-ers held yesterday afternoon at
Temple.
There is no disaffection In tne Republi
can ranks. All true blue Republicans are
for Davis. The Democrats are not united. ;
The spoils of office have spoiled the
chances of the party for success to-mor
row. The division of the fruits of a pros
l.iective victory has demoralized the lead
ers. They have deserted their whole
ticket and have gono off in squads to the.
Democratic candidates who promise the
greatest number of favors In the event of
victory. The talk is that Phelan has
given the word that he must be elected,
even if every other candidate on the tick
et Is traded off tor him.
In the Republican coiumn the feeling Is
entirely different. Every branch of the
partyâ every Republican organization, has
but "one purpose, the election of Horace
Davis and the whole republican ticket.
At the headquarters of the Republican
County Central Committee the feeling of
confidence und determination is marked.
The leaders state that everything points
to a Republican victory anu back up the
assertion by reports received from every
section of the city. In the History Build
ing, where Horace Davis has his head
quarters, the atmosphere of absolute con-
Jldence Is cheering and invigorating. With
the battle practically over, the generals
are satisfied with their work and the re
turns from all quarters justify them in
asserting that the people are with them.
They state with posltlveness that the elec
tion of the Republican standard bearer is
no longer in doubt. It is as absolutely
assured as anything can be in politics.
The only speculation in the Davis head
quarters is as to the size of the major- |
itr.
â Where tho Democrats congregate in the
Columbian Building the air is frosty and
the gloom that has settled over the place
is depresslngly apparent. The men in
charge still assert that 'helan is in the
nir, but they do not put any emphasis on
their statement that he will ever be any
place else. There Is a lacK of sincerity
in what information is given out. It is
not backed up but by that demeanor
which characterizes men who are talking
according to their convictions. Every
thing is said in a half-hearted way, and it
does not take a sage to appreciate what
is back of it all. The same feeling was
manifested at the meeting of the Demo
cratic officers of election at Metropolitan
Temple. There w q a lost cause atmos
phere about it that was not cheering to
the Phelanite heart.
The Democratic old woman can not
pweep back tho Davis tide with a Phelan
broom.
The campaign committee of thfÂ» Repub
lican County Committee announced last
night that the figures obtained from a
canvass of the city give assurance of
Horace Davis' election by a majority
ranging from two thousand five hundred
to four thousand. A. 13. Truman Bald
that the committee's canvassers had
taken the greatest care to reach the
facts of the situation and that he had
not the slightest doubt of a Republican
victory.
It is known that Boss Ralney and Mo-
Nab are now bending their e'nergles to
save Phelan,- Lane and Dodge from de
feat. In order to save these three saints
at Gavin McNab'a collection all other
Democratic candidates may be sacri
ficed at tho pleasure of the Committee
of One. Hundred. The indications point
to a general knifing of Jeremiah Deasy
rind Dennis Geary. Democrats who re
member the. merciless knifing of Maguire
to save I'helan in 1898 may conjecture
the fate in store for Deasy.
Nothing should induce Republicans to
â â¢waver In the firm resolve to vote the
straight Republican ticket. Victory Is
In eight for every nominee of the party.

Mayor Phelan's address to the Monti

would not appoint on the governing enm
missiona under the new charter any Re
publican that considered national ques
tions in this campaign, was not a vote
getting speech. !!â¢â¢ is not repeating the
threat. The charter does not hold that
the Mayor should define the qualiilca
tlons of a Republican, but it requires
that Republicans as well as Democrats
shall be selected. The indications are
that the people will confer upon Horace
Davis the prerogative of appointing the
commissions created by the new charter.
FIREMEN ORDERED
OUT FOR PHELAN
The edict has gone forth to the Fire Do
partment. That branch of the city's gov
ernment which, by the grace of Sam
Ralney, has been Mayor Phelan's greatest
source of political strength, got its orders
from the Bush-street Boss at 8 o'clock last
night, and woe to him who fails to-mor
row to obey them to tho letter. The
Ralney orders were plain and to the point:
"Vote for Phelan, vote for Dodge, vote for
Lane; or tender your resignation."
It is the delectable trio at . the head
of the ticket that the fire laddies have
been ordered to boost into office.' The
other candidates, headed by "poor old
Deasy," may look out for themselves.
The Phelan gang and the Phelan bosses
have grown desperate in the face of the
growing popularity of Horace Davis, and
their every energy Is being bent to hoist
themselves into office, even if the rest of
the programme goes Republican.
The Phelan-Rainey orders are not one
whit different than those Issued to the
Department last year, nor were they is
sued in any other way. It's the same old
game and the same old programme the
Bush-street boss has worked with his
department ever since It became one of
his political assets, and the foundation for
tho fortune he has built out of practical
politics.
The deal was consummated in the Bush
street stables on Saturday night when
Rainey summoned the District Engineers
of the Depaartment to meet with him and
a pair of his trusted lieutenants. Each
of them was instructed to hand Rainey's
orders over to the foremen in his district,
with further Instructions to spread the
word among the men. It was expected
that the foremen would do as ordered at
yesterday, morning's flre drill, but, for
some reason or other, it was postponed I
until 8 o clock last night. Then the dif
ferent crews were Instructed and were
also informed that to-day and to-morrow
only enough of them need report for duty
to answer Inside alarms. The others are
to got out and work and work hard for
the essentially Phelan end of the ticket,
and at the same time keep In telephonic

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, NOVEMBER fi. 1899.
LOYAL WORKINGMEN.
WORKIN QM E X of San
Francisco, aflk yourselves
if manly loyalty and
squart- conduct betwei n
man and man do not de
mand that you lend your strength
to Horace Davis at the polls to
morrow?
Did not Horaf c Davis in that
prolonged struf?i, r le in behalf of
frf-e white labor stand manfully at
his post of duty in Congress, bat
tling for the exclusion of Chinese
competition? Did he not stand
firm and resolute as the advocate
of the workingman's cause when
a weak man would have fallen
down?
It is recorded on the papers of
the Custom-house that a lucrative
trade In the Orientâ a trade esti
mated at $500,000 per annumâ was
sacrificed by .Mr. Davis for a
principle, and that principle was

ported. For forty-eight hours San Fran
cisco will be deprived of ample fire pro
tection in order that Mayor Phelan's
chances of election may be increased.
Ralney's orders to tho Department ln
: dhate as clearly as anything the real
I fight Phelan is making and hia hypoc
: risy in pretending to seek the election of
i the entire Democratic ticket. Ralney's
i instructions were that his men in the D( -
I partment should work for Phelan, Dodge
and Lane. Phelan wanted him to add
j Dennis Geary' a name to the list, but the
fat boss of Bush street would not stomach
the dose. Deasy, whom Phelan has knifed
every time he could make capital by do
ing so, was not included in the orders,
nor was Lewis F. Byington, Democracy's
candidate for District Attorney. Neither
for that matter were EdmondOodchaux.
Dr. Beverly < 'ole or any of the others
down to the last Police Judge.
Phelan's ignoring of Deasy has been
particularly marked. During the last few
; nights of the campaign he slighted him
; openly on the platform, and has pre
served only the most transparent sem
blance of friendship. Deasy is aware of
this, sis are his friends, and he knows the
j reason for it. Phelan was told shortly
after Deasy's nomination that, if the old
man were elected, he would probably de
mand the right to administer the af
fairs of his own office and distribute the
I patronage that attached to it and that
; noither the Mayor nor his political partner,
1 Ralney, would be allowed any more than
; th^y could beat out of him with a club.
I Phelan at once started trading on Deasy's
votes and he figures already a large profit
to himself. Dodge and Lane. Incident
ally the Deasy people have pulled a snlck
ersnee of their own and it is going into
the backs of the chosen three with as
much regularity as time and opportunity
will allow.
PHELAN AND RAINEY
DISAGREE ON GEARY
"tt'hen Mayor Phelan turned down M. C.
Haley and gave to ex-Major Dennis
Geary the Democratic nomination for
County Clerk, he brought no strength to
his ticket. Ha was warned of that fact
by reputable members of the nominating
convention which he controlled, but ig
nored decency in his desire to put up a
man whom he ligured would capture a i
fly portion of the "returned volun- I
vote. Since that time the exigen
cies of the campaign have brought out
many of the shady spots on the Geary
career, and it Is conjectured by those j
on the inside that not once but a half ;
dozen times has the Mayor been com
pelled to go down into his own pocket
and bring forth the coin with which to
save Geary from some of the many judg
ments which have Ptood for years against
him in local courts and which, since he
came into stolen political promin> n< >>,
have threatened the fag end of the repu
tation he has left.
The best men of his own party have
already repudiated Geary. Tho fact that
for a consideration he offered to betray
to a rival llrm the business secrets of his
employer and benefactor was more than
many a decent Democratic business man I
would "stand for." The "pollies" them- j
selves turned from him, for even the I
vilest of thi'in has no use for a man who
will not protect his friends.
And now Sam Raimy has turned him
down. The not delicate Kainey stomach
rebelled at Geary when he was proposed
for nomination, and the Bush-street boss
has championed his cause in only a half
hearted way, notwithstanding the re- !
peated request of Phelan that Geary be i
pushed forward with the others at the |
head <>f the ticket. Hainey listened to
Phelan respectfully, but In Geary's case
failed to take instructions, and when he
issued his orders to the Fire Department
â¢vi Saturday night made no mention of
"our hero's" num^. He was promptly
called upon by Phelan with ;i more urgent
request, but again was his Honor turned
down.
Even Phelan has admitted Geary's
to be a bad one. for since The Call's
first expose of that person's character he
has not been permitted to speak at the
regular Democratic hurrahs. Either his
Honor or some one other of the speakers
has done his talking for him, and the
Geary personality has been kept as much :
In the shade to which it is accustomed as I
possible.
A Card.
To my friends and the public: A state
ment has been made that I am not eli
gible to the office of Tax Collector. In
answer to the same I wish to say that I
am not only eligible, but was born and
reared in San Francisco and have also
been an elector of this city for nearly
fifteen years. JOSKPH H. SCOTT, '
Rep. Candidate for Tax Collector.
TOM CORBETT'S LEG BROKEN.
Brother of the Former Champion
Meets With an Accident While
Celebrating His Return.
Tom Corbett, brother of James J., the
ex-champion, arrived In the city a few
days ago from New York for the purpose
of enjoying a quiet rest. He is getting
itâ in bed with a compound fracture of
the leg.
Saturday evening Corbett met a num
ber of old friends and under their aus
pices started in to renew his acquaint
ance with that part of the town that
arises late. The party visited several
places of refreshment, In several of
which it was necessary to touch the but
ton for the waiter. At one place, where
the button was five feet from the lloor,
the ex-champ's brother attempted to
touch the button with ona of. his toes.
The result was a fall and a compound
fracture.

JUDGE TREADWELL
AN HONEST OFFICIAL
Judge A. B. Treadwell appears as a
candidate for re-election for the office of
Police Judge on the Citizens' Republican
ticket. The regular party has openly
and candidly admitted Us error in failing
to nominate a servant who has heen loyal
to the people and his friends. Fearlessly,
conscientiously and honestly has he
espoused the cause of the citizens of this
city His decision in the nickel-in-the
slot machine cases has gained for him
the respect of the moral community. His
friendship to the working men In order
ing that they shall not be chained as
felons and criminals; his provision that
children shall not be incarcerated in the
City Prison over night; his condemnation
of druggists who have not been regis
tered and his action In upholding the
State' medical act have won for him the
advocacy and support of all classes.
AVith such material at their disposal the
residents of this State have framed his
reputation and moulded his name. He
has been tried and has stood the test.
He successively held the position of
Judge of the Municipal Court of Stock
ton and Prosecuting Attorney of the
County of San Jnaquin. His record in
those positions bespeaks him well. A vote
oast in his favor will not be fruitful of
results to be regretted. â¦
