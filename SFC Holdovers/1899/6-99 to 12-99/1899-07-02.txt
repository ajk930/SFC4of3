As far as the Germans are concerned,
I I have been utterly unable to see how
they can be held responsible for the late
I troubles. They may have been at fault
in the past when old Laupepa was de
ported and an attempt made to push |
the : elder TamaseSe forward, but j
Mataafa spoiled that arrangement by
conquering Tamasese and causing him
self to be elected Kins. Mataafa "was j
then backed by. both America and Eng- |
land. After .Laupepa was returned to
Samoa the. Samoans were confronted
with the difficulty of having.two Kings.
Laupepa,. however,: voluntarily abdi
cated and Mataafa was proclaimed the
true King:. :Then 'â¢ came the; ; Berlin
treaty, which declared that I aupepa
should again be recognized. 'fbe Ma
taafa people rose up -in revolt. 6t this, j
with.the result that Mataafa whfc finally, j
exiled to Jajuit, on one :of the Marshall j
group. When last year after the-death...
of Laupepa, he was! brought .back by
the' three powers, (not by Gerrs-.any, as
has often/been publJÃh. 1 a "German
political agent/.', it ]s : if.od.Van the j
first;tb see him after th<= 3] |p arrived at j
Apia: I did not hay thÂ«V pleasure of
seeing any of.; these;; "German tical ;
agents" at Apia, but I suppose, they ex
ist there in' large numbers.- At; .an- rate
Mataafa was looked / upon with: sus
picion, â¢ afterward.; The Germans at j
first favored- Tamasese for..King; but it |
was soon .demonstrated that 'Mataafa
had almost .the entire Samoan race at
his back, so the Germans .very wisety
supported him. ; 'â '.['â ;â .: . â  . ' :;.
Now, right here is where many think
the American officials began to show j
stupidity. They had no reason to be
lieve that Mataafa would be controlled
by the Germans;; in fact everything
points to the contrary, and had they
supported him he would always have
been our friend and we would now have
a much tighter grip on; the.' Samoan
group than any other power. Mataafa'
has always been more friendly to Amer
ica than to either of the other two pow- j
ers. I myself have.seen a document '
written by him praying for American ;
annexation, and H. ; J. Moors, a promi- â '
nent American who resides . iti: Samoa* I
and who has more influence with Ma
taafa and the Safnqan people than any
other white man on. those islands, went
to Washington himself :.: and laid the
proposition before the i United States
Government during President Cleve- j
land's administration.'â¢ . ' â :'_'â 'â â  â¢- : ./. . >'-.y.
The fact that â¢ the Germans favored
Mataafa, however, ; was cause.enough I.
for the American officials to oppose
him. Mataafa was-appointed- King by j
the High Chiefs, who; had the.power to j
confer that title, and had fully 80 per
cent of the Sarao'ans': supporting him. j
The other 20 per .cent represented ' the. i
entire strength of both Tanu arid I
Tamasese, notwithstanding the utmost
efforts of the English beachcombers to
increase the number of their followers. | ;
Mataafa/a people gave notice of his !
election to the Consuls and Chief Jus- !.
tlce, who acknowledged receipt of the
notification without comment. Tam^ â¢
asese then withdrew from the contest
on the advice of the English, who prom
ised him the office of Vice King,, and
; SA^ FRANCISCO, SUNDAY, JULY 2, 1899-THIRTY-FOUTI rAQES.
Tanu then gave notice to the Consuls
and Chief Justice of his own election.
This /dispute brought th< matter into
the Supreme. Court and Chambers .had
his innings.. Th intention at tirst was
to pro ve that laafa was; not elected
on account .of his.not possessing certain.
titles. and also on account of other in
trfoate'reasons based upon Snmoan ous-,
. tr Â»r>.s .'-Ayh-Ich to a .laymen iir<r- hare?, to.
â t,.ulen<taiid: The unwritten.: Saisfen.'
lav/ is full of knotty problem?, ?nd it
would take too much space to â  plain
tl'L contentions which arose. .Attor
neys for Tanu produced many Samonn
witnesses to prove their case, but they
failed utterly to do so, and Chambers
was in sore straits for some point on
which to decide in favor of Tanu. The
much quoted protocol was finally pro
duced and Mataafa was declared ineli
gible, Chambers making the " startling
declaration in his decision that before
the trial he had not known of the ex
istence of the clause relating to Ma
taj.l'a'S alleged ineligibility, and this in
spite of the fact that the whole treaty
and protocols can be read in less than
half an hour. I have seen a letter from
Judge Chambers to a gentleman in
Apia, written just before the election,
in which he states he knows of no rea
son why Mataafa should not be elected
King. .
The Judge's written decision is based
o:; the following, paragraph, contained
in one of the protocols: ; â .â .'â ;â 
Count Bisniarck consented to the
principle of the election of a King,
but he did so upon the condition that
one [ exception should be made in the
person of Mataafa on account of the :
outrages committed by his. people
and under his authority upon dead
and wounded Gelman sailors lying on
the [ field of: action. . Sir E. Maletj
senior â¢ Plenipotentiary, on behalf :of
Great Britain, voiced the sentiments
of all the other Plenipotentiaries that
the exception ; made by : : Count Bis
marck was fair and . reasonable, stat- ;
ing' that his Government would have
probably . entertained similar objec
tion .had like .: outrages been com
mitted on British sailors. \v'.;s "'A/-'
Here :; 'is where Judge Chambers
stopped quoting, and declared Mataafa
ineligible. The Judge should have read;
a few lines further in the protocol and
he would have seen the following;'
which Svould se;erh to place an entirely'
different construction upon the para
graph:.- ; .:.-â  â ; ; . : ' ;
Mr. Phelps asked permission to re
vert to certain views expressed by
Count Bismarck at the beginning of
the ; session that he might state that
the 1 silence of the American Plenipo
tentiaries was not to be; construed as
assenting to those views, except as
they expressed an indignation at the
atrocities mentioned, with which the
United States heartily sympathized. ;
Happily the -assent of the conference
to Sir E. Mai proposition made the
question of who among the natives
was. responsible for these atrocities a
mere academic question and the sub
ject need not, therefore, be further
pursued. : ' â¢ . :'.':."' â  ':'
Thus was. Chambers at hfs wits' end
for I material upon which to base his
decision, knowing all the time there
would be bloodshed as soon as it was â 
rendered if unjust. ' '. : , â ':â' â  ... . :.
In conclusion, it is but Just to refer
to Admiral Kautz's interview published
in The :Call of June 10 and .'dated Ho
nolulu, 1 June 2, in which ;he;.statÂ«is that
when he arrived: at Samoa ; he- found a
great . deal of disorder. The Tanu men
were being : arrested and there -were

sufficient width and depth for vessels of

drifted in and has been thrown up to such
ab extent that at low tide one, may walk

Fattening Men for the Army.'
*It will astonish those who do : not know
the ways of the War Office to hoar that,:
in spite of nil the ridicule pourftd out a
year and a half ago upon the idiotic regu
lation requiring all candidates 1 for the
army to turn the. -scale at a. certain
weight, irrespective. of their height, chest. |
measurement, etc., this regulation is still
b>ing enforced. I hear that at, the last ,
hrmy examination several ' -"candidates'- ;
were rejected under this rule. The
ne>- plus ultra of absurdity seems to have j
been reached in one or two cases whero j
the candidates were actually' told thf>l :
they could come up again in three months' !
time, so that .the authorities deliberately
send a man down to be fattened up be
fore admission to: the army... We shall
hear next that the army "crammer", has

PITTSBURG, July I.â There now

I received them in the company's oflice,
i and not only discharged them, but in
\ formed them that they could not go
; back, into the mill to get their dinner'
buckets. This action of the company in
censed th 6 .Amalgamated 5 people and
they, immediately took steps, to get their
members and sympathizers out of ; the ?:
mill. | The : result : of this . movement Is
Eomewhat in doubt, as the men claim
to have been successful in having at
leÂ«at 500 skilled steel. workers quit work,
thereby seriously crippling the mill. ;j

WASHINGTON, July I.â President
McKinley to-day presented to the
French Embassador, M. Cambon, a su
perb silver loving cup in recognition of
' the Embassador's friendly services in
the negotiations which restored peace
between the United States and Spain.
â  The beautiful testimonial was sent by
Set retary Hay to the French embassy,
accornpajiied by a note irom the Sec
retary, in -.which, sp.; 1 king for the Pres
ident, he expn ssi-ii si net -re appreciation
of M, Garhbon's. considerate and disin
-1 ter^sted services and tendered the lov
ing cup-as an evidence: of/the esteem
felt for him. ;.-â â¢:â  :
Thr cup is of ma Fsive proportions and
chaste design, and the internationai
significance of. the gift is shown in.the
blending <>i' the French and American
coats of amis. It stands about two and
I: a half feet ..high, with the top of the
bowl about ten: -Inches acmss. The
I miter surface is silver, richly embossed,
while the Inside is of hammered gold.
Around the outside Of the bowl, in
i raised old English text, runs the fol
| lowing inscription: "Presented by the
President of the United States to his
Excellency, M. Jules Cambon, Embas
sador of Franco, in token of his friendly
services in the negotiation of the pro
tocol of peace between the United
1 States and Spain, August 12, 1898."
I The bowl is sunnorted on the shoul
ders of three American eagles. These
1 in turn are on a massive silver pedestal
i around which circle the thirteen stars
| emblematic of the thirteen original
I States. The three handles of the cup
| are myrtle leaves, symbolic of the
peaceful offices which M. Cambon per
formed. On the three faces of the cup,
where the handles join the bowl, ap
pear the coat of arms of France, with
tin* letters "R. ;-;F."â RepubliqueFran

The box in which the loving cup is
I enclosed is another triumph of the jew
! eU-r's art. It is of lierht birdseye maple,
highly polished, with brass tri.mmintrs,
bearing the mpnogram; of the Ernbassa'
dor. The interior of the box is lined
with crimson velvets and the whole is
enveloped in a pack of olive velvet.
A ltogether.. the President's gift is one
of uncommon richness and artistic
beauty: ': 'â  â  :'? â  ::.' . :â *â  ' : ' ': . '-. . - - 'â '.
;\Vhen the gift and the letter were re
ceived at the French Embassy AI.
Cambon was absent, not having re
turned from his New England trip.
Under the circumstances the letter will
remain sealed and the box unopened
until the Embassador's return, which
is expected shortly. After receiving his |
recent degree of LL.D. from Harvard!
he went to Manchester-by-the-Sea for >
a few days. The President's gift will,
be an entire surprise to him and will be '
gratifying alike for its personal as well j
as Its national significance. The Queen i
Ptegent of Spain has already decorated
M. Cambon for his services in the peace

.. AUSTIN, July I.â There has been an
other twenty-four hours of continuous
heavy v rainfall throughout the flooded
districts .of Central and South Texas,
with result that: the rivers and streams
have had - their overflows greatly aug
j; mented, inflicting additional loss and
damage, aggregating hundreds of thou
i sands ;â  of dollars to . the : agricultural in
terests. The rainfall in this immediate
section last : night was over two Inches
and east of here, along the course of the
Brazos River,; it exceeded that amount.
In a number of localities the down
pour was in the nature of cloud-burst,
which destroyed growing Crops and
property of various descriptions. It is
the most remarkable period of weather
ever recorded in Texas. To-day reports
were received of terrific floods in the
Nueees, Guadalbupe and othe streams
of the southwestern parts of the State.
The full effect of the floods of the
Brazos arid Colorado rivers are how
being felt in their far lower courses
and for a distance of over one hundred
miles back from where these streams
empty into the Gulf, and for a width
of 150 miles, the whole country is under
water. The bottom lands are hot
only overflowed but hundreds of thou
sands of acres located some distance
l>a<-k from the main channels of the
streams are flooded to .'-a, depth of sev
eral feet. As this still water lv"= no
outlet it will remain for some time after
high; waiters in the streams have r-Ã¼b
sided, totally ruining the growing
crops.
Henry Larowe of Houston arrived
here from the flooded district below
Hearne this >\ening. He stated that
the loss to the cotton planters in that
sect i<-Â»n alone would aggregate three
(juart&rs of a million dollars, and that
the total loss in the State would cer
tainly roach 200 ; 0fl0 bales. In addition
to losiiu 1 " their ki" wing crops, many
extensive planters have had their sub
stantial farm buildings swept away. It
is Ed seldom that a disastrous flood oc
curs in thfe'v Brazos and tributary
sti'-ams that no prbtectipn in the way
.â ;' i^yees is aiTorded the planters, and
tor this reason the losses are much
greater than they otherwise would
have â¢"â â¢â n. . â /. : .
It is the first time in the history of
Texas that all the railroads in the State
haw been practically tied up on ac
lount of floods. There are a few lines
in the northern part of the State that
ai'' still uninterrupted', but on all the
principal roads traffic is completely
suspended- -Man\ costly steel bridges,
long stretches of trestle work and
scores of miles of track and roadbed
are washed away. When the waters
subside it will take several weeks to re
pair the roads. Numerous unconfirmed
reports of deaths by drowning have
reached here. In W r ashington County
several negro families living in a clus
ter of er.bins in the Brazos bottoms
are said to have been cut off from all
â¢-â¢scape by the Hood, and. as the piece
of ground upon which they lived is un
der water, it is believed they were
swept into the raging current and
drowned. Hundreds of men are search
ing the remote localities along the
course of the river in boats and on rafts
rescuing negroes and whites from the
tops of trees.
A telephone mr-ssrifre was received
here this evening from Franklin stat
ing that the town of l.,nke Station,
elven miles east of here, is completely
under water and that about thirty resi
dences in the place have been washed
away. The deluge came slowly, enabling
the inhabitants to seek safety on higher
grounds.
A large number of small settlements
south of Hempstead are also under
water and have been abandoned by the
inhabitants.
Wild reports are in circulation re
garding the situation at Calvert, a
;,n>speroiis town located near the junc
tion of the Brazos and Little Brazos
rivers. Telegraph and telephone com
munication with the place was abruptly
cut off last evening and no word has
been received here from there since that
time.
When the wires went down a message
was being sent stating: that the town
was â  .threatened. . A complete overflow
and a :.heayy- loss of . life had already
:oPcurred/ ; : Bey .'bodies of negroes hav
ing been recovered. An effort to-night
to secure .-.-telephonic communication
proved futile. : . Another storm visited
this section, south of Austin, this after
noon, doing. much damage. ; ;

THE OLD WAY
Of Treating Dyspepsia and Indiges-
tion by Dieting a Dangerous
and Useless One.
We say the old way, but really It Is a
very common one at the present time and
many dyspeptics and physicians as well
consider the first step to take In attempt-
ing to cure indigestion is to diet, either by
selecting certain foods and rejecting oth-
ers or to greatly diminish the quantity
. -usual Vy taken; in other words, the star-
vation plan is supposed by many to be the
first essential.
The almost certain failure of the star-
vation cure has been proven time and
<i train, but still the momrnt dyspepsia
makes its appearance a course of dieting
is at once advised.
All this is radically wrong. It Is foolish
and unscientific to rpcomme'nd dieting to
a man suffering from dyspepsia, because
Indigestion itself starves every organ,
every nerve and every fiber of the body.
What the dyspeptic wants is abundant
nutrition, which means plenty of good,
wholesome, well cooked food, and some-
thing to assist the weak stomach to digest
It. This is exactly the purpose for which
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are adapted,
I and this is the method by which they cure
: the worst cases of dyspepsia. In other
j words, the patient eats plenty of whole-
: some food and Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets
| digest it for him. Tn this way the system
! is nourished and the overworked stomach
rested, because the tablets will digest the
food whether the stomach works or not.
One of these tablets will digest 3000 grains
of meat or eggs.
Tour druggist will tell you that Stuart's
Tablets is the purest and safest remedy
for stomach troubles, and every trial
makes one more friend for this excellent
preparation. Sold for 50 cents for full
sized packages at all drug stores.

LONDON, July I.â Mention has al
ready been made about two under
ground railroads which are now near
ing completion to the new tunnel un
der the Thames to the great central
thoroughfare, which Is being made at
an enormous cost, appropriating val
uable property and sweeping away
whole blocks of buildings in the space
of three-quarters of a mile, between
Holborn and the Strand, but there are
two more great schemes on hand now.
One of these is another underground
railroad, or rather tram, as it is called.
The County Council seems to like the
scheme, which, of course, means that
it is safe. It will for one thing not be
anything like so expensive to build as
the other underground systems.
It will be just under the pavements
and will do away with many incon
venient, and, most important of
all, those abominable street disturb
ances caused by repairing water pipes,
telegraph, electric mains and cables,
I which at present are always causing
such inconvenience through the pulling
up of the streets. All these pipes will
be carried, hereafter, in the conduit de
signed for the town. The fact is that
traffic in the Strand is already badly
congested under normal conditions,
without being subject to block by the
tearing up of the pavement.
Undoubtedly the County Council is
waking up. They are making the pub
lic open its eyes, too, though the latter
cannot quite make up its mind whether
to grumble or look pleased.
Seven million eight hundred and tifty
one dollars is the latest little amount
the County Council has added to its
i improvement scheme account. This is
for the long talked about Thames em
\ bankment extension, or rather a bit
j of it.
County Claimed Seven Times Over.
Another owner of visionary land in
Georgia has been discovered in a party In
Xetf York city, who writes Secretary <>f
State Conk that he holds title to TL',OOO
acres "f arable property in Montgomery
County, and will in the near future rome
to Georgia for the express purpose of
walking into his inheritance. T'p to the
present time title has been presented, off
and on. f"r something over 7.000.000 acres
of land in this county of Montgomery,
while only a seventh of that amount actu
ally lies in the county. Tt has been
known for years that the fraudulent
grants of land made In 1743, during the
administration of Governor Matthews,
did little credit to the record of that Gov
ernor's administration, but the awful and
apparently endless extent of the fraud has
only heirun to be realized within the last
few yenrs.â Savannah News.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
MONTEREY, Mexico., July I.â The
yellow fever situation in Southern Mex
ico is very alarming. The epidemic has
spread to so many coast and remote
interior points that the danger of the
contagion becoming general throughout
the low lands of the country Is very
great. Dr. L. E. Cofer of the United
States Marine Hospital service has gone
to Vera Cruz, where he will conduct a
thorough Investigation of the epidemic
with a view of adopting some method
that will insure against the disease
being carried to United States ports
and border points.
In conjunction with this proposed
precautionary method Dr. Cofer has al
ready arranged with the officials of the
railways entering the City- of Mexico
and from Vera Cruz and all intermediate
points, as well as from all other places
south of that city, to keep a check on
all passengers and to notify the United
States quarantine inspectors of all per
sons who come from the Infected dis-
tricts.
Dr. Cofer will arrange a system of
issuing certificates to all railway pas
sengers who desire to enter the United
States, reciting the movements of the
passenger and baggage for a period of
ten days previous to the entry Into: the
United State. s
The Marine Hospital service treats
every place south of Vera Cruz to the
Guatemala border, including Progress
and Coalzacoalcos, as infected. It is
clearly realized that it is going to re
quire extreme vigilance to prevent th?
disease spreading to the United States
through the gulf ports of the Texas
border.
Used a Confederate Stamp.
A farmer living in Highland County who
desired to make a deposit in one of the
Staunton banks, sent his money by regis
tered mall. This is not out of the ordin
ary, because this is a safe way to flend
money, but the peculiar part of the trans
action's that the farmer used a 10-eent
Confederate stamp, presumably not know
ing the civil war has ended,' and another
strange incident is that the letter' passed
through the hands of the Highland; ttnd
Staunton officers without being detected.â

GAS WAR OVER
IN SACRAMENTO
Capital Gas Company
Has Been Absorbed.
STOCK SELLING FOR A SONG
INTERESTING STORY OF THE
FIGHT FOR SUPREMACY.
Rival Concerns Kept Cutting Throats
Until One of Them Was
Forced to the
Wall.
SpeclaJ Dispatch to The Call.
SA(3RAMENTO,;JuIy I.â The Capital
. Gas Company, at one time one of the
most prosperous corporations on the !
I Pacific Coast, was: practically absorbed !
; to-day by the Sacramento Electric, Gas j
! and Railway Company when the latter |
â  company secured possession of the con- j
1 trolling section of its stock. ' .
A bitter warfare has long been in j
progress between the two corporations. ;
Before the advent of the Electric, Gas |
and Railway Company, better known !
as . the : Folsom Company, the Capital j
Gas Company had an absolute monop
oly of the lighting- business of this city.
; Six. or seven years ago the stock of the
; company sold: for $56 and $58 per share, I
i and paid from 6 to -7 per cent upon that !
j" valuation. .Then the Folsom Company
' came into the: field and made a bid to
| light -the city/.with; electricity, entering
( also into a spirited competition for the
) patronage of /private consumers. The
; gas company, had already established a
large.arid costly- electrical plant in con-:.
nectio-ri w ith its gas tanks. -. : . ;.
The war re was, most bitter, the gas
compahy, heretofore deemed invincible, ]
making;^very'effdi-t to maintain its
prestige. The- contract prices for light- [
\ ing 1 the-, city . dropped; to one-half, and j
theli iohfe-auarter the old charges. Res- â 
idences blazed with, from thirty to forty
incandescent. Eights'. ; nightly.-, and the
bills at the. end of; the month amounted
â¢! to little mo;re than a Bong. Indeed, the
â¢ rival .companies; were willing to offer j
i flat, rates to consumers for. almost any
I term desired. 'â¢.â '.â : , . 'â  -' : r
; While the battle raged fiercest a new
element entered the field in the shape
.of the South :.Yub'a" Company. This j
! company also began: to cut; rate's in an i
J alarming fashion^' It was. seen that j
pome one If not more of the qfrmpanies
would have to;go to the wall. The Capi
tal Gas: Company's, stock dropped from
JSB per ..share until.it paid no dividend^,
and was not even quoted cm the mar- .
! ket. Some of . the. members.: assert that :
had the company confined itself to the
[gas business i; would still be : declaring â }
i dividend?. At any rate a majority of.:
the stockholders Were glad to consoli
date with the Folsom company and the
identity of the old Company has been
obliterated.- : â  . â¢:â¢;'â . â  ... â  ' â  -
T.he..Ca-Pital Gad Company has had
the Central Electrical Company, the
: . Sacramento adjunct of the South Yuba
Company, as an.'.'.'ally in Its .warfare
through a contract under which the.
gas company used the current of the.
South yuba Company for Us. .lighting.

ST. LOUIS, July I.â The Republic to
morrow will publish, with favorable edi
torial comment, m article furnished ny
Profesaor Waterhouse of 'Washing-ton
University, this city, on the subject of a
proper name for this country, the chief |
points of which are as follows:
At present there is no proper name that
distinctively describes this country. Co- ;
lumbia and America apply to the whole '
western hemisphere. The people of Can
ada and Mexico, of Central and South :
America, are all Americans and might ]
Justly resent the pretensions which claim
that title exclusively for the inhabitants of
the United States uf North America. The
United States" is an awkward expression.
It is plural in form and singular in sense.
It dues not afford personal or adjective
derivatives. United Statesmen and
United Statesian are admissibly harsh.
â¢'fcinlted States of North America" is an:
exact designation of this country. II â¢
ftjpst letters of these words form the word
"usMiia." This term is agri to the
ear. singular in number and precise In
definition. Its Introduction will substl

A CONTROVERSY WAS FEARED
ALREADY IT HAS BEEN SE
VERELY CRITICIZED.
A Commission of Cardinals Has Ex

Published.
El>*c!al Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, July I.â What threat
j ened to be a bitter controversy in the
Roman Catholic church in this coun
| try has been settled by the submission
I to the authorities in Rome of Very Rev.
i Dr. John A. Zahm. Provincial of the
I Fathers of the Holy Cross, an order of
| priests which is in charge of the Uni- I
versity of Notre Dame, Indiana, and
j conducts a college affiliated with the |
i Catholic University In Washington. !
Dr. Zahm has been one of the most j
outspoken advocates in the Catholic
church of the theory of evolution.
A few years ago he issued a book
called "Evolution and Dogma," that
was severely criticized in many quar
ters. The views he set forth. It was
declared by his critics, were contrary
itholic doctrine. It became known
recently that the commission of Canli-
In Rome was examining his work,
and a decision was expected soon.
But Dr. Zahm himself now cornea for
ward In a letter, in which he asks that
. his book be withdrawn from sale.
Among the well-informed Catholics
this action is regarded as an evidence
that the Roman authorities do not ap
prove of his work on evolution, and
that he has decided to submit to their
judgment.
Dr. Zahm, since the publication of
"Evolution and Dogma," has had to
stand some of the most bitter attacks
ever made In any Catholic controversy
; in this country. He is known as a
; friend; of Cardinal Gibbons, Archbishop
1 Ireland and Archbishop Keene, and the
; enemies of those prelates In the West
are united In assailing him. He was
called not only liberal, but even he

UTTERANCES OF
THE EMPEROR
THEJIPEROH
Question of Their Dis
cussion in Reichstag.
Copyrighted. 1899. by the Associated Pre
BERLIN, July 1.-The adjournment
of the Reichstag has been followed by
a lively press discussion in regard to
mentioning in debate the Emperorâ¢ s (
utterances and the Emperor's relations
to the Reichstag. Count yon Balle
strem, the president, introduced an in
novation of the old rule that the words
of the monarch are not subject to dis
cussion by admitting such discussion
where the words were printed in. the
Official Reichsanzeiger. Near the |g
of the anti-strike bill discussion Her
Brefeld, the Prussian Minister of Com
merce, sharply criticized the presiden
for permitting a reference to words of
the Emperor. The president replied with
sharpness and directness.
The papers admit the difficulty of ob
serving the old rule of constitutional
monarchies that the .monarch only â 
sneaks through the ministers, for the
frSuent speeches of the Emperor on
PoUUcal subjects render the observa
tion of the rule almost impossibly
The Tageblatt says: The Kaiser,
with his impulsive nature aÂ«d seeking
to act in his own person, has changed
Se entire question. The old doctrine
cannot be upheld in the case of the
monarch who speaks, writes or tele
graphs his views from shipboard with
out the presence of a responsible mml
lb The Frankfurter Zeitung says: "It
would be simply hypocrisy and an im
possible demand that the representa
tives â  of the people should ignore.the
large share of the Kaiser in the politics
of the day."
The press devotes much attention to
the launching of the new French Min
istry On. the whole it sympathizes
with the Ministry as against the oppo
sition. The Frankfurter Zeitung sees
in the declaration of the French Cabi
net proof that it is made of different
stuff from its predecessors, and believes
its small majority will be soon followed
by a much greater one. _ â.*â¦Â«.
The Kreuz Zeitung predicts that the
new Cabinet will not survive the ver
dict to be rendered at Rennes, whatever
it may be. â¢â â  * â  *'â  â â  '--
The elevation of Yon Bulow, the j
Minister of Foreign Affairs, to a count
ship has been received. with much sat
isfaction by the press. The comment, ,
almost without exception, is highly ap
preciative of his statesmanlike quail
ties.: This comes from papers most, dif- !
ferent in shades of opinion. : -y" j
The National Zeitung considers his ;
elevation a well-deserved recognition of j
his amcial activity, refers to the strong
position he has gained in public opin
ion and says it is confident he will grow
Stronger With the country and the Em
peror.
The press emphasizes the fact that
Yon Bulow has improved the relations
of Germany with Great Britain and
Russia and begins to see in him a suc
cessor of Prince Hohenlohe as Imperial
Chancellor. The only jarring note
comes from the Agrarian Correspon
denz, which reproaches him with "weak
ness in yielding to English arrogance.
The news published here that Admiral
Dewey had written a very kind letter
to Admiral Dledrichs, regretting the
"false reports spread" regarding their
relations at Manila, has been received
with much satisfaction. It is said the
letter will be published when Admiral
Dledrichs returns to Germany. .-..:â¢:
The Barmen Chamber of Commerce
demands decided action toward the
United States in tariff matters and
suggest that American goods be sub
jected to the same conditions here as
German goods in the United States in
regard to Consular authentication of j
Invoices and fees. The agrarian press
strongly Indorses this and notes the
fact that the Berlin Chamber is a free
trade body. : =' -;.'-
While Berlin is in the toils of politi
cal uncertainty the Emperor has been !
greatly enjoying himself at Kiel, j
where, surrounded by a congenial com
pany of Princes and yachting men, he !
has been showing himself to be a good i
fellow by taking part in "beer even
ings." Later, after his Majesty's re
turn from Norway, he will attend the
opening" of the Dortmund-Ems canal.
August 3, and after the autumn ,
maneuvers in Alsace-Lorraine he will
be the guest of the King of Wurtem- "!
berg at Friedrichshofen, where the Em
peror will witness experiments with the
balloon invented by Count Zoppolin.
The youngest three of the imperial ;
children are spending the summer at j
Berchtestgaden, in Upper Bavaria,
where they are entered on the *vest j
lists under the incognito of Count
Ravensberg.
The Emperor, inspired by the United
States Columbian postage stamps, has
ordered the issue of a new series for I
1900. They will illustrate the history of
the Hohenzollerns. The nosta/ authori
ties here have been unable to find a j
native artist to do the work and have |
engaged an Englishman to design the i
stamps, who received 10.00J marks for
so doing.

THE AMERICAN ORDNANCE COM
PANY FIGURES IN IT.
Alleged That Mieklejohn Followed
the Syndicate's Orders Too
Closely to Suit the
Secretary.
Special Dispatch to ThÂ« CalL.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, WELL
INGTON HOTEL, Washington, July
I.â There are official differences be
tween Secretary AJger and Assistant
Secretary Mieklejohn. As Acting Sec
retary of War Mr. Mieklejohn dissolved
the insular commission and- declined to
award the contract for guns to the
Wrigga-Seabury Gun and Ammunition
Company, directing that advertise
ments for new bids be issued. Secre
tary Alger several days ago revoked
the order relative to the dissolution of
the insular commission, and to-day he
awarded the contract for guns to the
Driggs-Seabury Com] any.
Secretary Alger's course has not been
pleasing to the Assistant Secretary, but
the latter is too loyal to the head of the
department to/ publicly . criticize him.
Ills friends, however, axe not so willing
to maintain silence, and they have been
speculating all afternoon, as to the con
duct of Mr. : Mleklejohjr in the future.
It is pointed out by them that when
Secretary Alger leaves the department
and- Mr. Mieklejohn remains in charge,
the latter will naturally decline to as
sume the responsibility -whan his judg
ment may be disapproved by his chief.
The result of the action of the Secre
tary will be, they say, that the business
of the department when he is- away will
be delayed and; trte Secretary will have
no one to blame for it but himself.
On the other hand It is pointed out
In behalf of Secretary Algrer that the
insular commission- â¢ . had not â¢ com
pleted its work, consisting of investi
gating applications for- franchises, and
that to interrupt the. Investigation at
this time would be to the injury of pub
â¢}iq interests." Members, of the commis
sion were very much displeased at Mr;
Mieklejohn's action, though the As-
Fistant Secretary was led to take it be
cause of a lack of funds to: pay their
'salaries.:'- \ ; ..-. ' ; ".
Secretary Alger, however, is confi
dent.that their pay can be legally con
tinued, -and he purposes to have the
commission remain in- existence until
Its .work- is completed.,'.' So far as the
pun contracts are concerned; there are
some, who gp'sofar as to say; that the
Secretary's action, is" simply in accord
ance with hifkreeently xpressed views
regarding; trust's.' of which the Ameri
can -Ordnan-cV -Company;- which has es
pecially /opposed the awarding of the
contract; 1 to . the Drijggs-Seabury Com
pany, is alleged, to/be an illustration.

SHERIFF YOUNG
AS A WITNESS
Tells of the Riots at
Wardner.
COULD NOT MAKE ARRESTS
SUCH AN ATTEMPT WOUXD
â ...' '. HAVE MEANT DEATH.
*
Denies That He Told a Correspondent
That Union Men Should Have
the "Best of It" in
Reports.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
: WALLACE, Idaho, July I.â This I
morning J. M. Porter testified that on j
April 26 he called up Sheriff Young over j
the telephone, telling him of the riot- !
ous conduct of armed men, asking to be '
appointed a deputy sheriff. Young de- j
clined, saying he would refer the mat- I
ter to his deputy.
Connor Malott, a correspondent of the j
Spokesman-Review, testified to a con- j
versation with the Sheriff before the |
riot of April 29, when Young objected to i
â¢ stories he was sending out, saying the j
witness should give the strikers "the |
best of it" in making reports. Chris j
Eyrie and four or five other deputies
serving at that time were members of
the union.
The defense only put one witness, j
Sheriff Young himself, on the stand in
the impeachment case. He was called |
for information in addition to that
given in the case against the County i
Commissioners. He said in his opinion
arrests could have been made after the ;
mob dispersed and settled down, but ;
any attempt while they were still to
gether would have meant death to the j
person making the arrest.
He said he had no chance to make |
arrests afterward, as he was busy j
guarding- the Last Chance mill until j
May 3, when he was summoned before
the Coroner's jury. He was before that
body three days and then was -arrested i
by the military authorities. He had
not attempted to shield the rioters or
prevent the arrest of any one accused
of crime. Â»' â â ".â 'â â 'â 
Witness denied that he told Malott, I
correspondent o" the Spokane Spokes
man-Review that the union men should j
be given the best of it in the reports j
on the situation.
"Did you base yoair opinion that to
attempt the arrest of members of th*Â»
mob would result In death, on what
you knew of the history and methods
of the union?" hf was asked on â 
examination, but the court sustained
the objection to the question and the
witness was excused.
The defense thÂ»n rested, and It was
agreed that argument in the Impeach
ment case against thÂ° commissioners
and Sheriff should be made Wednesday,
each Bide being allowed three hours.
The court then adjourned until Wed
nesday morning.
Twenty-live more Missouri miners
for the Standard mine arrived this
morning.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CAI/L, SUNDAY, JULY 2, 1899.
GETTING READY FOR
THE AUTOMOBILE RUN
TO SAN FRANCISCO
When Sufficiently Strengthened
the Vehicle of Mr. and Mrs.
Davis Will Leave New York.
NEW YORK, July I.â The company j
which is building the automobile
in which Mr. and Mrs. John D. j
Davis will make the trip from
this city to San Francisco, under the j
management of the San Francisco Call
and the Herald, is desirous that noth
ing shall be left undone on their part
to insure the success of the trip. Since j
the slight accident on Friday night
they have discovered several ways in
which the automobile can be strength
ened and improved for the long and
rough Journey before it- For this rea
son they have asked a little more time,
which Mr. Davis has granted, and the
carriage will be perfected in every de
tail. The Call will announce within a
few days the exact time of departure.
Mr. Davis went to Stamford, Conn.,
to-day to see to placing a new brake
on his automobile, which is being com
pleted at the factory of the National
Motor Company in that town. The ac
cident which caused a postponement of
the start was due to the giving way c/f
an extra brake which was put on for
use in descending mountains. The or
dinary brake provided fur a touring
cart is worked by the pressure of the
foot and operates upon the rear axle.
While that answers for all ordinary
grades it was decided to add a plain, i
(â¢â¢Id-fashioned hand brake that would I
clutch the tires and assure safety in
going down any hill. In testing this
brake on Friday on a hill near Stam
ford a steel rod snapped and injured!
the pneumatic tires. A new brake was
made to-day and new tires were put
on. Mr. Davis said that he would run
the automobile from Stamford to this
city to-morrow and be ready for the
start Monday morning.
Aside from the new brake Mr. Davis
has had the seat widened and the back
made higher, so that the discomfort of
the long ride will be lessened as much
as possible.
Some difficulty has been experienced
in obtaining a roadmeter for the car
riaye. There are plenty of cyclometers
on the market, but they are made for
wheels of smaller diameter than are
used on motor carriages. Mr. Davis W
told me that he found the American
manufacturers are slow in preparing to
meet the wants of automobilists. The
best dashboard clocks, he said, were of I
: o manufacture.
Only a limited amount of baggage
â Rill be carried by Mr. and Mrs. Davis,
owing to the lack of room. A small
trunk will be strapped on the back of
the seat and in this will be placed an
exceedingly limited wardrobe for the
tourists. Mrs. Davis, who is an at
tractive young woman, was dismayed
when she learned that she could carry
but one costume in addition to what
she wore. Her daily attire will sug
gest mountain climbing. She will wear
a short skirt, bicycle boots, shirt waist
and soft gray felt hat adorned with an
3 feather. The hat has a very
wide brim and Is known as an "auto
mobile." Mrs. Davis" skirt is of the
length approved by the Rainy Day
Club, six Inches clear of the ground.
Mrs. Davis la enthusiastic over the
trip, but a? she has never been in the
West she is making inquiries as to the
likelihood of meeting Indians on the
path or road agents from Devil's
Hole.
Mr. Davis has ridden on the plains
and has no apprehensions. Speaking of
his plans t<'-<.lay, he said: "T do not
I to make the best time during the
first part of the run, as the motor is
just out of the factory. After wp have
been going a few days it will undoubt
edly run smoother, and I can eret more
speed out of it. I look for all kinds
of mishaps, from punctured tirea to
breaks in parts of the machinery due to
rapid running on rou^h roads. I shall
curry such as duplicate parts as are not
too heavy and will have a kit of tools
to tighten up nuts that become loose or
to make any other repairs that are nec
essary. Every part of the motor is

SANTA ROSA. July I.â The second

morning-. When State President Newby
brought his gavel down and called the
assemblage to order it was 9 o'clock. A
knowledge of the fact that one of the

BEAUTIES OF THE TRIP
ACROSS THE CONTINENT
Dr. Wetzwl Tells of the Route That
May Be Traversed by The
Call's Automobile.
To the Editor of The Callâ Sir: The j
transcontinental automobile trip will have
a peculiar interest for me. Perhaps of all !
the thousands none will better appreciate i
the pleasures and dangers more than I.
I have traveled both for business and
pleasure by river and by rail. South and
North, East and West, but the pleasant
est of all was by a one-horse convej-anee. ;
Even through the Rockies, with the song
of the coyote to lull me to sleep and at
times the roar of the mountain lion to j
lull me awake again. I found the Stanton â¢
pike to be the best macadamized road
and the easiest grade from near the capi- j
tal (D. C.) to Parkersburg, on the Ohio j
River. It traverses the length east and
west of West Virginia, through some of
the grandest scenery to be found outside
of Switzerland. Deer and smaller game j
add a zest to the trip thru only a sports
man can enjoy. The worst roads are not
through the mountains, but anywhere |
and everywhere in the Mississippi* Valley i
from the Ohio to the lakes and as far
West as thÂ« Missouri River. Chuck holes, I
dust and mud will be the automobile's ]
portion on every road for many hundred i
miles. Prairie chickens, duck and small ;
game will alone be found in all this re- j
gion. The almost monotonous level Is
varied by small hills and streams with a. ;
few stretches of rough country, but the
roads are primitive and poor in bad
weather, with but few exceptions.
f Near one town in Indiana I paid toll
upon three roads upon entering and leav
ing the town, costing :in average of 3
a mile for driving a one-horse
buggy through the sticky mini.
Through Kansas and Nebraska the
roads are, in the main, as level as a
floor and free from dust or mud. .By !
keeping north of th>> Platte River,
through Great Rend, tho automobile will I
noi have to cross a single stream worthy !
of the name of river until it is well over
Into Utah in the Green River country,
and bunts aro here to bear it across.
Along all this route gasoline is a com
mon fuel, .so there need be no anxiety I
upon this score. Wood and water are in |
some places harder to get. The "red- j
bed" roads upon the Rocky Mountains j
are uniformly the best to be found upon
the whole journey. A reddish stone or
hard-packed sand with no steep grades
after once reaching the top. 1 have
hunted big game from Trinidad, Colo., to
Cheyenne, Wyo.. and advise the auto- j
mobile to avoid the passes between these:
two points. Th^ old Laramie trail from
Cheyenne to Salt Lake City is by all odds
the best. The only steep or rough road
is In t!i<- western foothills. The mountain j
are perfect. The sagehen and jack
rabbit here continue Into and through the j
mountains. Antelope, deer, bear and a '
few elk will stand and stare at the auto
mobile from a safe distance, but the buf
falo has ceased standing or staring for a
dozen years.
Every hour tho automobile will pass
some "ranch" along this route. Every!
spring is the key to a grazing area.
Horses, cattle, sheep, chickens, eggs, but
t'T. etc.. are a source of large revenue.
houses and their inmates would
compare favorably with any in the New
England StatPs, and every one will give
the automobile a hearty welcome.
From Salt Lake west to Portland tho
roads an- good, i Kcept for the dust in the
wheat district of Eastern Oregon
and Washington. Nevada I have no per
sonal knowledge of and cannot advise,
but again I will say the mountain roads
across the Rockies are grand.

The subject of what the children could

forth some good thoughts, and the idea
of how best to raise the missionary fundd
was participated In by several mission
aries, whose experiences in spending It
were heard with considerable interest.
The entire morning was consumed In
the consideration of the round-table
topics. When the afternoon session was
called to order Miss Louella Williams
conducted the usual song service, after
which the reports were beard from the
round-table leaders. These wire followed
: by singing, in which all Joined,
which the floor was cleared for action and
the election of officers began. The bal
loting consumed a large part of the after
, noon and resulted In the selection of the
! following representative leaguers, who
; will preside over the destinies of the or-
I ganlzation for the ensuing year:
Samuel W. Brown of San Jose, presi

Following the election of oflieers came
the selection of the place for holding the
i next convention. Los Angeles, Vi-alia
j and Hollister were proposed by thr dele
k itea and emissaries of the three places
named. Just as the convention was pre
paring to vote upon the matter it wa.s an
nounced that the time set yesterday by
the Centra] street railway In Its Invitation
in â¢njoy its hospitality had arrived. A
'. hasty adjournment was taken and the
delegates piled on to the waiting cars and
started on a pleasant ride. As they trav
eled thej sang, and the resident;, of the
northern portion of the city through
which the lines of the Central' Company
puss were treated to a serenade such as
' they never heard before. At the end of
I the line is located the Pacific Methodist

When the delegates arrived there a stop
was ordered and a visit was paid to the
! grounds and building of that well-known
' institution. The college Is under the con

its vis-it naturally proved full of interest.
President Wilkinson was on hand and cx
i tended the hospitality of the occasion.
To-night's Bessionuwas called i.> order
at S o'clock. A programme slightly dif

A Gala Programme Arranged, Be

Special Dispatch to The CmXL
SAX RAFAEL. July I.â A small matter
of the flags used In decorating the streets
of this city for the Fourth of July cele
bration has not only subjected the execu
tive committee having charge of the af
fair to vigorous denunciation but for a
j while threatened seriously to mar what
will undoubtedly be the greatest celebra
tion of the nation's birthday ever held In
Marin County.
The work of decoration has been pur
sued mder the direction of a man of ex
perience in that line. Bearing in mini the
I fact that a large percentage of the male
population of Marin is native to the Stato
the decorator concluded that Native Son
flags should be given a good deal of prom
inence, and his suggestion met with the
favor of the committee.
Accordingly strings have been stretched
across the sjreets to which the flags are
appended. In the center of each was
placed a Native Son emblem, while tho
ends were adorned by Old Glory. The in
tervening space was filled with red,
white, blue, green and varicolored ban
ners. Hardly had Fourth street been dec
orated in tins fashion when there arose
a howl "prolonged and loud" from all but
the native element. Led by James Wat
son, one of the oldest residents of ihe
city, Informal meetings have been held
daily, and none of the committee has so
far escaped verbal censure on every oc
casion that offered. The objection was
not voiced against the Native Son flags
being used in the decoration but against
what was regarded as the undue promi
nence given them. The "'kickers" said it
would be all right for the emblem of the
order to adorn the center of the strings
if it were Admission day, but that the
natal holiday should see the stars and
stripes in the most conspicuous position
possible. The objections had their effect,
and to-day the decorations were changed
and tlie work of preparation for a big
cell bration goes merrily on.
The celebration will begin on the even
inig of July 3 with a bicycle parade. In
which 600 wheelm< n are expected to par
ticipate. The "horribles" will follow with
a procession and the Richardson band of
Sausalito will furnish music in the Court
house plaza. The midnight hour will be
heralded with a display of fireworks and
the booming of cannon, shrieking of whis
tles and ringing of bells.
At sunrise on the Fourth a salute will

visions and will be enlivened by the ap
pearance of the Veteran Firemen of San
Francisco. The Foresters, the Knights of
Pythias and the Young Men's Institute
will be r< presented by floats, among
which Dewey's flagship, the Olvmpia. will
be the chief figure. Miss Bertha Kappen
mann as goddess of liberty will have a
specially Improvised float, 'the design of
which does great credit to Tidball, and
will be surrounded with a number of alle
gorical tableaux, The officers of the pa

a picnic will be given at San Rafael Park,
where dancing and games will continue
until dark. At 8:30 p. m. there will be a
magnificent pyrotechnic display, for

SANTA CRT'Z. July I.â Members of the
Grand Army of the Republic, the Sons of
Veterans and the Woman's Relief Corps
now have the town for the next half
month.
To-day every train brought members of
this order to the city, and for the past
w>Â«-k they have been coming overland.
The camp ground is situated In a pic
turesque spot bordering on the San
Lorenzo river near its mouth, and toward
the south are the blue waters of Mon

Is an old fashioned reunion. The old
soldiers and their entire families reside in
the tents. The tents are arranged in
rows with streets between.
Through the middle of the center street

aid of redwood trees and boughs, into a
veritable bower. T'nder this are easy
chairs. It Is a family gathering place,
where the days of the war and reminis
cences are talked over. "Water mains
have been laid down each street and fau
cets placed at every liftle disiance. Six
furnaces for cooking purposes have been
placed around the grounds. The streets
have been wired and electric lights fur
nish the light at night.
From the amount of cordwood piled In
tiers it looks as if there was enough for
campfires for months to come, but a
Grand Army encampment without a
nightly campfire would not be one. Im
mense logs have been hauled from the
river find these will be used for fuel.
The Wallace Reynolds Post. G. A. R.. of
Santa Cruz has its headquarters torn
decorated very elaborately with ever
greens and bunting. The immense as
sembly tent has been pitched, and here
every night addresses will be given by
thi' most prominent men of the State.
There was no regular programme to
day, but Sunday and Monday will be de

quarters and getting acquainted.
Tuesday, July 4, will be the formal

CANAL BILL AND
CABINET CRISIS
William Displeased With
the Ministry.
Copyrighted. 1599. by ttiÂ« Associated Press.
BERLIN, July I.â The canal question
overshadowed everything this week and
the final outcome is more doubtful than
ever. The air is full of rumors of com
promises, combinations, dissolution and
reconstruction of the Ministry. The op
ponents of the bill continue the policy
of seeking to kill it by bringing forward
as many rival projects for compensa
tion as possible, these now numbering
about 150. None of them has been
made in good faith, but for the sole
purpose of gaining time to eventually
checkmate the supporters of the canal.
Yesterday an amendment was voted
inserting 2.000,000 marks for preliminary
work on the Oder. This secures the
support of the Silesian Centrists and
clearly improves the chances of the
bill. The talk of dissolution does not
impress the Conservatives, who do not
believe the Ministers will have the cour
age-to appeal to the country, although
Dr. Miquel, the vice president of the
Council of Ministers and Minister of
Finance, informed a member of the
committee that the failure of the bill
would certainly be followed by a disso
lution. This threat has been overlooked
as if it had not been made.
The Liberals and Centrists also doubt
that the Ministry will go to the length
of a dissolution, as it will involve a
radical change in Prussian politics.
The question of Dr. Miquel's retire
ment from the Ministry has again come
to the front.
The correspondent of the Associated
Press learns that the Emperor has
shown plainly his dissatisfaction with
the manner in which Dr. Miquel has
conducted the fight when the Minister
reported the status of the bill. Dr.
Miquel has always been considered as
particularly solid with the Emperor,
and this is the first occasion upon which
it Is known that his Majesty was dis
pleased with him. This may not mean
that the Emperor is determined to dis
miss Dr. Miquel, but it is recognized
that if the bill fails further attempts to
pass it with the present Ministry will
be in vain. The Minister's position w-ith
the various partita has also been
greatly damaged since the question
came up, and he has been sharply crit
icized on all sides. It seems as if all
parties are about to drop it.
Dr. Miquel's fate, whatever it may
tx>. Is likely to be the fate of the entire
Ministry, as its defeat on so important
a measure will leave the Ministry with
out sufficient influence to carry on the
affairs of the state. The kind of Min
istry likely to succeed the present one
begins to engage attention.
The Munich Allgemein Zeitung be
lieves the Emperor is contemQlating
replacing th? present Cabinet officers
with a Liberal Ministry. This is re
ceived with skepticism, even the Lib
eral leaders recognizing the impossibil
ity of so doing in the present state of
politics, assuming that only a Conser
vative Ministry can follow the present
one.

says Baron Yon Koeller, the Governor
of Schleswig-Holstein, is still in gTeat
favor with the Emperor. But as a.
great friend of the Agrarians, he
would be the last to act against them.
Count Eulenburg is also mentioned.
He has long been regarded as a man
with a large political future, but as ha
is also a strong Agrarian he is an
other impossibility.
The discussion of possible Ministers
seems premature in a country where
ministries are so little responsible to
the Legislature as in Germany.
The Diet takes a recess next week
until August, when it will reassemble
and resume the discussion of the
canal bill, August 15, when the fate of
the Ministry will be settled. In the
meanwhile the correspondent of the
Associated Press learns from an ex
cellent source that attempts will be
made by the Centrists and Liberals to
reach a compromise on the canal and
reformation of municipal election
questions, so they may present a unit
ed front.
The informer of the correspondent, a
person who Is in close touch with, the
Centrists, believes a compromise will
be effected, and also hopes the Left
and some of the Conservatives, who
are officials, will vote for the canal bill
or absent themselves in sufficient
numbers to Insure the passage of the
measure.
Whatever the result of the present
crisis, it is certain it marks a turning
point in Prussian politics. The Agra
rians have shown such stubbornness
in opposition to the progressive classes
that the conflict must continue until
one or the other permanently gains
the supremacy. Even the moderate
Liberals are more than ever before
Incensed at the Agrarian reactionary
tendencies. It seems as if the conflict
could not end without leaving a per
manent mark on Prussian political
history.
MARCONI MOW HAS
MANY IMITATORS
Special Cable to The Call and th* New York
Herald. Copyrighted. ISM, by James Gor
don Bennett.
LONDON, July I.â The success of Mar
coni's wireless telegraphy has had the ex
pected result of bringing a great number
of imitators. The latest of these is S. H.
Smith, who has proposed to the post
master genoral a scheme to connect the
Channel Islands with the south roast of
England, telegraphically and teiephoni
cally on wireless principles.
Smith's system of improving 1 Marconi's
invention la an arrnngt-ment of a better
transmitter, a more sensitive receiver arid
an instrument for fixing- the sound of
waves so that they can be picked ..up only
by one receiver and are thus incapable of
being intercepted.
He also claims to be able to dispense
entirely with high vortical wire?. I saw
H. Jameson Davis, managing director of
the wireless Telegraphy Company, which
owns Marconi's patent?, and he told mo
he had a knowledge of Smith's po-ralled
improvements, but they could not be re
garded as at all feasible.

â â â¢..-; A type of the kind of allies our imperial
-â .-found fondness for "Anglo-Saxon!

THE TAX LEVY.
THE pledges of both parties in the last municipal
campaign were rigidly to the effect tiiat the tax
levy' for this year should not exceed one dollar j
on the hundred on an assumed total assessed valuation
of $350,000,000. These pledges were largely based j
upon the reiterated assurance of Mayor Phelan after
nearly two years' experience as the head of the miini-
I cipal government that the dollar limit, with the addi
! tional restriction as to the basis of assessment, added
to other ordinary sources of revenue, would produce
a sufficient income for all municipal purposes. No
man could have made a more industrious canvass than
Mr. Phelan. He seemed to be almost Ã¼biquitous, fre
quently making half a dozen speeches in widely sep
.;'parts of the city in a single evening. Wher
ever he went the strictest adherence to the dollar limit
was the burden of his song. This was a standing ar
nt that appealed to the tax-laden citizens with <
ilar force and. probably more than any other !
ent in the campaign, enabled Mr. Phelan to se
cure an isolated victory that in most respects was a j
defeat.
Mr. Pljieian was the Examiner's pet candidate. If,
possible* it indorsed him more vociferously than even:
candidate for Governor. It literally roared |
and howled over the economical part of his claims j
to public support, the inconsistency of which, in re
lation to the c:i< rraous expenditures he proposed in
the acquisition of public utilities, was observed every
where except in those fusion circles where socialistic
doctrines were rampant.
i be Republicans accepted the pledge of economy,
so formulated that it was literally ironclad, in perfect j
good faith. When the new Board of Supervisors met 1
and Mayor Phelan delivered his second inaugural he
illy reiterated on his own behalf and impressed
upon every member the pledge which in honor and in
conscience they were bound to keep. It is true that
the figures he then presented involved some relaxa
tion of the technical rigidity of the pledge, but, as to
two items, one of $130,000 for deficiencies in official
salaries and another of $125,000 for the purchase of St. j
Mary's Park, there was a general concession that they j
were to be added to the dollar tax.
Auditor Weiis. a business man of large experience!
arid of excellent character, made an estimate for the
levy for the fiscal year that commenced yesterday
which amounted in the aggregate to $5468,142, and
placed, the rate at $1 r6 on a valuation of $350,000,000.
But this estimate, however closely pruned, consider
ably exceeds the pledge, exclusive of the two items to
which we have above referred. The Finance Com
mittee of the Board of Supervisors, in the most
and detailed manner, and carrying out to i
tter their own pledge, which also represented al
the entire political capital of Mayor Phelan. re
vised this estimate and brought the sum total down
to $4,938,578, of which $3,755,000, or the proportion to
be raised by the tax levy, involved a rate of $1,073.
On Friday last The Call exclusively published in full
the schedules representing the scaling of the Finance
Committee, and proving the accuracy and the fidel
ity with which the labor had been performed.
In our local columns yesterday there was a full ex
pression of the consternation that the mere act of
keeping a promise had produced in the City Hall.
It appeared that nearly every head of a de
partment protested. Dr. Perrault, the chairman
of the Finance Committee of the Board of
Supervisors, beyond his individual indorsement
of the pledge, furnished the most unanswer
able reasons for the schedules that had been pre- i
pared, and expressed the willingness of the committee |
to consent to any modification or readjustment that '
Mayor Phelan could suggest that would meet the de
mands of the exasperated protestants, without disre
ing or evading the plain obligation of honor
which had been so often renewed.
The Examiner also, the great "internal poli
manufacturer, the special champion of Mayor Phelan,
the fusion representative that wastes both time and
5 in false charges against the Republican party, â 
now virtually repudiates the pledge to which Mayor
Phelan is fully committed and claims that the sched
ules of the Finance Committee are not official and :
are intended only to justify extravagance in Septem
ber next. Those schedules merely fulfill a trust. The
Call hopes that Mayor Phelan and every other muni
cipal officer of either party who has subscribed to the j
dollar limit will be held, as all gentlemen should be j
held, to the fulfillment of their word.
THE FOURTH OF JULY FUND.
rROM every point of view it is to be regretted
that something in the nature of a scandal has
occurred in the work of the committee chosen to
i arrange for the public celebration of the Fourth of
I July. In the absence of a formal conviction of any
\ one of the charge of having sought to obtain a fee for
< arranging a display of fireworks at Glen Park, the
: public will give the accused party the benefit of such
doubts as exist, but the mere suspicion that any mem
\ bers of the committee are using their authority for the
purpose of private gain is enough to destroy popular
confidence and prevent anything like cordial co
operation with the committee in preparing for the
celebration.
It is not too much to say that the celebration of
Independence day is something in the nature of a
sacred festival to the American people. They expect
those appointed to take charge of the arrangements
â  to enter upon the work animated by no other mo
tive that a genuine patriotism. For that reason
they are more exacting in their demands upon such
committees than upon almost any other class of pub
; lie servants. When the people are assured that every
dollar contributed to the Fourth of July fund will be
expended solely for the celebration they give
. . but when evidence appears that the managers
are locating the display of fireworks for the purpose
; of advancing private interests, or are in any other
way taking advantage of the occasion for personal
i profit, they at once turn away with indignation and
' disgu>t
It behooves the Supervisors to be careful in the ap
pointment of members of the Fourth of July com
mittee, and the committee itself to be extra careful
in the selection of officers to carry out the work. In
| tht present instance the scandal was promptly ex
! posed, and the parties involved in it deprived of au
i thonty to act for the committee. Nevertheless, the
j injury has been done, and the splendor of the cele
bration will be largely diminished by reason of it.
Where feelings of ardent patriotism are to be ap
; pealed to there must be no slightest cause for doubt
<is to the purity of those who make the appeal. Popu
lar sentiment revolts from the thought that the cele
bration of the Fourth of July is to be taken advan
tage of for the purjx.se of working private schemes.
Indeed, there should be stringent laws to punish any
one found guilty of such acts. In the absence of any
adequate law on the subject, the man known to have
j0 d in that way should be excluded by public
indignation from any further service of the people.
I One experience of this kind is enough. Those who
would conduct patriotic festivals must themselves be
! patriots.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JULY 2, 1899.
THE PHELAN- EXAMINER SUMMER
SAULT.
THE CALL has some reason for gratification, not
that its suspicions of a few of our public men
have been confirmed, but that it failed to be
lieve their self-righteous protestations. For example,
the Examiner and Mayor Phelan, in their fusion co
partnership of last year, were almost frantic in their
opposition to the Huntington monopoly. But time
and opportunity have placed them exactly where they
belong. "
When the Examiner was supporting Mayor Phelan
for re-election, its Canadian Annex, though trimming
to catch the railroad wind and professing Republican
opinions, was equally strenuous in his advocacy and
presented all the symptoms of a subsidized personal
organ of the candidate who talked constantly through
his hat. When Mr. Huntington broke the railroad
pledge of abstinence from interference with politics,
and lor months rallied every corrupt element in the
State to fasten Dan Burns upon the Federal Senate,
the Examiner and its Canadian Annex helped the
scheme with all their might and main. The Call then
and repeatedly charged that there was a de'.ib
ate conspiracy that originated with the Huntington
monopoly to turn this State over to the fusion
Democracy in iooo, and that a hundred straws indi
cated that the independence, the intelligence and the
integrity of the Republican party, vindicated by the
Senatorial deadlock, had driven Mr. Huntington into
a new alliance, in which the nominal positions of iBgB
would be reversed.
Thickening events point toward the speedy realiza
j tion of this prediction. Mayor Phelan fell down from
[ the extreme position he originally took on the gas
and electric monopoly, and on that issue the resolution
for which he was responsible destroyed the legal
status of the public in the courts. When the Market
i Street Railway Company planned its clean-up of
nearly all the rights the municipality had left in its
streets and in its connecting easements, The Call
promptly and by unanswerable facts and figures stood
by the honest half of the Board of Supervisors. Mayor
j Phelan was most bold and energetic in his denuncia
tion of the outrage. But again he has fallen down,
and this time he lies so prone that his utter prostra
, tion cannot be overlooked.
The northeastern part of the city needed increased
street railway accommodations. The Call in every
way facilitated the effort to secure them. It advo
cated the full investment of the Post street system,
wih its legitimate connections, including Montgomery
and Sansome streets, with all the privileges and rights
essential to the demands of trade, commerce and
property, as represented, for instance, by the Mer
chants' Association. But it uncompromisingly op
posed the new franchise on Grant avenue and Bush
; street, the real purpose of which on the part of the
Market street monopoly was and is to shut out com-
petition.
On this basis the whole matter was apparently set
tled. But now the advocacy of this outrageous fran
chise is renewed, and with Mayor Phelan's expressed
consent. His weak knees have again given way, and,
although he is interested in property on Grant
avenue, which fact alone on the high elevation he
has assumed to occupy ought to have strengthened his
original determination, his surrender is directly to the
benefit of the street railway department of the Hun
tington monopoly.
Mayor Phelan still retains the support of the Ex
aminer and its Canadian Annex. But he has now also
distinctly acquired the right of a labored eulogy from
the regular newspaper attorney of the monopoly,
which was published on Friday under the heading,
"Render unto Caesnr the things that are Caesar's."
That is exactly what has been done by Mr. Phelan.
Mr. Huntingdon is Caesar, and, so far as the Mayor
can handle the situation, to him the new railroad
franchise has been duly rendered. The change from
a possible Brutus to Marc Antony, with the approba
tion of the Examiner, its Canadian Annex and the
evening railroad sheet, will attract general notice.
Perhaps there are six of the Supervisors who would
still prefer to range themselves with Brutus.
The International Council of Women, which is now j
in session at London, solemnly invoked the other day,
; in the name of universal womanhood, the blessings of
peace and good will to the world. One of the speak- j
ers, who exercised her feminine privilege of having i
an opinion of her own, was then hooted, hissed and
jeered. The ladies of the council ought to join the i
Peace Conference at The Hague and contribute to its
I enthusiastic confusion.
William . Davis, the negro expressman, who be-
trayed Osca Welburn into the hands of the Federal
authorities, must have the heart of Judas under his j
black hide. He is a thief who is not wearing convict
stripes because of the magnanimity of Welburn. j
When the time-came for the thief to show his grati
tude his greedy eyes saw the glitter of a mythical j
reward and he pointed out his benefactor to the ar
resting officers.
Mrs. Charles B. Trescott, wife of a millionaire fish
packer of Portland, Or., has made her debut on the
local stage. She claims to have studied the occult
sciences to such purpose that she is able to establish
an electrical connection between herself and the au
dience. Retaliation by the audience in the shape of
string or any other connection between its members
and the bouquets they may throw is barred.
The Czar's Utopian congress is holding its peace
with a vengeance these days. All sounds from the i
House in the Wood are drowned out by the roarings
of the Dreyfusards and the antis at Rennes, the riot- j
ings of the high and low Dutch at Brussels, and the j
grumblings of the Boer Dutch in the Transvaal.
The wail of the horse fly is heard in the land. When j
the cable and electricity supplanted the equine in street \
car propulsion he almost starved to death, but man- i
aged to struggle on. Now that the automobile has:
appeared on the scene he is ready to turn up his toes.
The wolf is camped at his door at last.
J. M. Chretien and T. P. Robinson realize now,
perhaps, that they were not expected,. as members of
the fireworks committee, to make a pyrotechnic dis
play of themselves.
A glance at the proposed appropriation for the Fire
Department for the fiscal year, which will end next
July, encourages the belief that fewer purchases,
whatever the price, will be made in the open market.
Grass will be short for the sheep of Gage in the
Health Department. The difference between expecta
tion and realization in the appropriation is painful.
The Minister of Justice in the Waldeck-Rousseau
Cabinet is Monsieur Mobs. It is ten tn one that
President Loubet will soon call for his resignation.
An alderman of Milwaukee was covered with dough

EDITORIAL VARIATIONS.
BY JOHN McNfIUGHT.
The late Charles Kopp of this city
found in a congenial woman certain
charms which made him tired of his
wife, and thereupon he transferred to
the charmer not only his affections,
which were not wurth much, but cer
tain property worth a good deal, which
his wife had helped him to earn. The
wife coming home from a visit to the
far off East, and finding that her hus
band had taken advantage of her ab
sence to deprive her and her child of a
home and of the means of obtaining a
new one, proceeded to blow a hole
through the head of him and made him
a good husband by making him dead.
A Coroner's jury sitting upon the
le and the problem returned a ver
dict of justifiable homicide.
Upon this showing my contemporary
moralists gibe at the jury and main
tain that such a Verdict tends to
cheap human life and encourage mur
der. Such critics are too captious for
anything. It may b<> conceded that love
is the supreme thing in human life;
that a man ought in obedience to di
vine Jaw leave a woman whom he does
not love for one whom he does love;
but there remains the fact that a man
who gives up his wife for love ought
to give up everything for love, the com
munity property Included. When a
husband robs a sick wife for the pur
pose of enriching his love, he merits
just as much of this earth as is re
quired to bury him.
The verdict of the Coroner's jury is
approve,].

The high contracting parties to the
Belmont-Sloane divorce and marriage
affair have gone into the retirement
of a honeymoon hedged around with
many millions, but they have loft be
hind them as pretty a kettle of fish as
ever enticed every cook In the country
to take a hand in the frying. The Is
sue is on e to which the original parties
in the case may be and probably are
Indifferent. The creature in the trying
pan is the preacher who roarrie.cj them.
That reverend gentleman, W. .M. iAr
rows of Greenwich, Conn., was taken
t.-. task a short time ag'> by the General
Association of Congregational Minis
isters for marrying the couple, but he
succeeded in making such a defense
that i mnation was pronounced
upon him, notwithstanding the reports
to the contrary. In fact, so far from
denouncing him the resolutions adopted
by the association were drawn in such
a way as to enable Mr. Barrows to vote
for them and thus put himself in line
with his fellow clergymen on the sub
ject of the duty of ministers when
asked to marry divorced people.
So far all appears right and good,
but it skills that in defending himself
Mr. Barrows claimed he had been de
ceived by the parties to the marriage,
it i.s stated 1 that in the course of the
discus â â  Rev. Washington <"h.:at.
of Greenwich, a personal friend of Mr.
.\s, Baid that Mrs. Sloane had
given Mr, Barrows to understand that
she had secured a divorce from her
husband on the ground of infidelity a
year previously, and that the minister
had married her under the impression
that she was the innocent party and
was entitled to remarry according to
the rules of the church. When he dis
covered the facts be returned to Mr.
Belmont the fee which had been paid
to him.
Thus Mr. Burrows obtained acquittal
at the hands of his brethren by accus
ing the contracting parties of cheating
him, but in dome so he flopped himself
out of the th ologica] stew only to fall
into the public frying pan.
A certain Mr. Hubbard, an attorney
of Greenwich, acted as agent in ar
ranging for the marriage, and when he
heard the accusation of cheating
brought against his clients he rose in
their defense. He is reported to have
said in a recent Interview:
"I called Dr. Barrows out from a
committee meeting on the Thursday
night preceding the wedding and tcld
him I would give him $250 to perform
a wedding ceremony on Saturday morn
ing. The only question he asked me
was if it would be proper to marry
them, and I told him that I knew of no
objections. T also said to him that the
bride would be a divorcee when she ar
rived at the parsonage, and that the
only bad thing connected with the af
fair would be the notoriety, which
would extend from Dan to Beersheba."
Continuing his statement, the attor
ney went on to say:
"That Friday afternoon after the di
vorce had been granted, Mr. Sullivan,
from De Lancey NicoH's office in New-
York, came to Greenwich, unknown at
the time to me, and called on Dr. Bar
rows. He told Dr. Barrows that hÂ«? un
derstood arrangements had been male
through me to marry the couple on Sat
urday morning. Mr. Sullivan says, and
I have no reason to doubt his word,
that Dr. Barrows said he had agreed,
but had since made up his mind not to
do so.
"Mr. Sullivan says he asked Mr. 'nar
rows to perform the ceremony that
night, and when he hesitated he told
him that the fee I offered should be
doubled, making $500. After Mr. Bel
inont was married he gave the minister
ten $50 bills inclosed in an envelope.
This. I understand, Dr. .Barrows has
since returned to Mr. IMmont."
Such is the situation. Dr. Barrows
has a record he is not proud of. He
declined to marry a couple for $250, but
consented for $500, and then returned
the money. The only point in tho evi
dence that does him credit is that ho
was ignorant of the Sloane oCandal, and
did not know the circumstances under
which the marriage took place. Evi
dently the reverend gentleman does not
read the yellow journals, and for that
virtue we can forgive him much.
Among the evidences of the rap!.] it y
with which the automobile is coming
into general use in the East are the
ordinances which various eitie3 are en
acting against its use. Every step in
human progress has to confront ad
verse legislation as soon as it gets
strong enough to confront anything-
There was once a host of Drdinances
against the use of bioyeles. It was said
of them, as of the automobile, that they
frighten horses, endanger life, consti
tute a public nuisance and disturb the
traffic of streets and highway a. Thf
bike has won its way and so will ihe
"Tommy," as the New Yorkers cailed
the automobile. The bike, moreover,
h;.s Caused an Improvement in streets
and highways, and so will the new ma
chine. The ordinances may star.d fast,
but the automobile moves Last, and by
and by it will run over the ordinances
â¢tuid then for self-crotiction the author.
[ ities will repeal them to get them out j
lof the way. :â '. ':/./ ,'. ;â  : . . ;

By a vote of the delegates of the ;
Peace Conference -summoned to The
Hague to give a little spectacular per
formance : for the amusement of the;
Czar, it has been decided that the
United States and Great Britain repre
sent and stand up for the barbarisms :
of war, while Russia is the: champion.
of an enlightened and merciful human
ity even in the rage of battle. : â â ..- : ;
â 'â â  The Issue upon which the decision;
was reached :is interesting , since It;
: shows the acuteness of diplomatic in
tellects and the keenness, with which
the august conferees, even after a..
Ketherlarid. dinner, can distinguish be- :â '
tween the merits or demerits of various 1
methods of putting an end to an enemy j
who is trying- to put an end to you. :
.: The issue arose on : ;a": question :
whether or no a civilized "nation may
use in war shells charged with ,
asphyxiating gas. . America and Great
Britain said "Yes." Russia said "No.';
Captain ?Mahan, in supporting the
American view of the case, asked why
the employment of gas should be inter
dicted while the more cruel.; wholesale â 
destruction of life aimed at by the sub- i
marine torpedo should be permitted. i
"A shell charged with asphyxiating gas i
need not necessarily destroy human ,
life," he said, "any more than chloro- j
form, but : might only place men hora, i
de combat for a time; whereas a sub- j
marine boat, stealthily approaching
under cover of darkness, might send a
thousand /sleeping men to \a- watery !
grave. Why forbid retail asphyxiation
by air and permit wholesale asphyxia
tion by water?" . \ ;\'. :â  -Â: . : . v :
To that question Colonel Jilinsky re- ;
plied that- after a successful torpedo at-,
tack the ; : victor would bend all his
energies to save as many of the drown
ing enemy as possible, and so attrac
tively did he present that humane view
of the subject that he brought the ma- :
jority of the conferees to his side and '.
won his case. Thus Captain Mahan
has to take a back seat and the Czar ;
can boast of having achieved at least
one victory for humanity. It remains
to be seen, however, whether in a
; naval battle a Russian ship, after hav
ing reduced one of the fleet of. the en
emy to a : sinking condition, will then
bend all of its energies to saving life j
Instead of going forward to attack and j
if possible sink another ship.

â¢ The controversy Concerning the use
of asphyxiating gas in shells is not the i :
only humorous freak that has been }
thus far developed at the Conference. â 
In the debate on the question of es
tablishing a permanent tribunal of in
ternational arbitration Dr. Zorn, one
of the German delegates, objected j
strenuously to the motion, and said:
"A king holding his title by divine right
could not think of divesting himself of
an essential part of his sovereignty, the !
right to shape the nation's course at a I
critical time." .
The introduction of the idea of di- i
vine right of kings into such a debate
struck Sir Julian Pauncefote as in- ;
congruous, and he described it as "a j
view of statecraft which is not mod- i
em." That is decidedly a very diplo- I
matic way of putting it. The Ameri
can delegates appear to have been ren- j
dered speechless by the very thought "of
it. At any rate they had nothing to ;
say. It is certain, however, that the i
divine right of kings cannot be made to !
conform with international arbitration. i
One or the other must give way, and if !
the Peace Conference cannot induce
the Kaiser to resign, it had better ad
journ.
"THE ADVENTURE OF
THE LADY URSULA"
IN most plays one sees ideas tend to
repeat themselves, acts to recall simi
lar acts, but "Lady Ursula" does n t
invite comparison. A person of tena
cious memory might be dimly conscious
that a Sheridan atmosphere was closing
about him and find a whiff of time from
the absorbing business of feeling new in
fluences to say that he was glad of it.
To us it seems one of those unimprovable
plays that at groat Intervals dawn upon
the dramatic horizon. 'Tis not especially
attractive at the first look, but grows
upon you gradually, until it possesses a
beauty you scarce felt it could contain.
Characters .often walk about in plays for
purposes that, except to the author, are
inimitable, but here each figure has its
reason and charms by its sÃillful coloring.
We should like it to be our fate to walk
through life hand in hand with Lady
Ursula, find if it were nut for Sir George
Sylvester', in the person of Mr. Miller,
that most perfect stage lover, we might
"raise the siege," even in the face of
certain defeat. From (he moment my
lady comefi. Within the orbit of our vision
we, like the Impressionist, have but uiie
point of view, and those who would be in
the picture, except as grateful masses of
background color, must keep close to her
ladyship's elbow. ShÂ« is something new
in Huge womanhood, a distinct creation.
The frank enjoyment she gets from her
escapade even in the midst of threaten
ing disclosure, bespeaks the ingenue
ness of bubbling: girlhood, not trodden out
by prudish education. As she gropi
timid road to manliness by copying the
sling of Sir George's legs and the man
ner of his strides j she plows her way into
our hearts with the deepest and softest
of furrows. Who would not love her?
Who could account her light or unre
spectable? Who could pop aught but the
thoroughbred, whose very security lies In
her never feeling the neod of protection?
Words are plenty, but they cling to our
pens for very shame at their Inadequate
ness when We v ribe the love
scene in the third act. T7ie subtle some
thing that gives to music Its insidious in
fluence is there in perfection. Our antici
pations are keenly alive to a climax How
can Sir George resist the temptation to
fold his arm? about her? He is but hu
man. And yet did he break the spell by
so much as a touch we should r>!,Â»!
Thank you. Mr. Miller; add one. more
laurel to your already crowded wreath
When the curtain falls on Miss Anglin'a
' I : n't know what 1 am mad with but
mad I am," we want the lights kept' low
th" hands held tight', the silence un
broken. But suddenly, our unwillingness
to break the spell is $wamped in our wil
lingness to let them know how true they
â ^ung. The effort costs us a few
tears, but what of that?
"We have had occasion before to speak
of Miss Anglin's pauses. In "Lady Ur
sula" they are quite as eloquent as her
w.rds. In real life the Indecent ha
our vis-a-vis to take the privilege of talk
ing from us keeps us from scoring half
our points. Go and learn a lesion in
sy from the society La<ly Ursula
moves in. No on- would dare to pre-empt
her pauses by so much as a gest
ure. Her portrayal of the character 'is
above criticism.
Mr. Miller's Sir George Sylvester isâ
well, it is Sir George Sylvester, and who
can say more? The Mr. Dent of ,j, ... ;>h
Alderman is a fine characterization He
absolutely bristles with the duel sprit of
the age. Mr. Morgan as the Ea--1 o;' Has
senden but strengthens the Impression he
gave us in "The Liars." We regret the
part is not a larger one. The minor parts
are all played in perfect harmnny with
the. main theme, and this is art. The
mounting of the piece deserve.- a word

Company while Stader reported that he
had ; collected $210, which he refused to
turn over.
\Y. J. "Herri n of the finance committee,
Faid that the two members had collected
the money as the representatives of the
Fourth of July Committee, and that as
mrnittee had no guarantee that they
return the money to the donors,
and further; that as their condurt was un
manly and not commendable, he
moved the"y be dropped. The motion
was unanimous!}- carried. A formal
::d will be made upon Schnee
.Stader .for. the money collected,
so ' that : the committee, may return
the people who donated it. The
committee was of fhe opinion that this
I be done for the protection of the
p putation of the' body. Schnee in his let
ter made a.; number of unpleasant impu
tations against the fairness and honesty
of the committee.. His contention and
that of Btader was that they col
lected the money with the understand-
THE SAIST FRANCISCO CALL, SUM) AT, JULY 2, 1899.
Inpr that the fireworks were to be. at
Glen Park. This the committee de
cided was not .so. If the money was se
cured under such pretenses they were
false, as Schme nnd Stader were mem
bers of the finance committee and were
only Instructed to collect for the Fourth
of July celebration, without any refer
ence to fireworks.
The display of fireworks will be upon
the blocks hounded by Fourteenth and
Sixteenth, Hi. ward and Folsom streets,
owned by the Mechanics' Institute. The
grounds will be thrown open to the public,
but ten cents will be charged for admis
slon to the grand stand. The finance
committee reported that it had on hand
$1542, Independent of the collections made
by Schnei and Stader, and that it had
no use for tho money collected by them
and would not use it.
The committee on Invitations reported
that of the 300 invitations pent out there
had lifon ten acceptances. So far this is
the number that will ride In hacks. Those
who have accepted, according to the re
port of J. n. O'Brien, chairman of the
carriage committee, are: I. J. Tomalty,
J. J. Cassldy, J. S. Ward el I. D. S. O'Brien,
s. Dannebaum, P. J. Walsh, L. Battles,
M. Fragley, Eugene D. Sullivan and John
li. Shine. Even two of these invitations
were conditional. Cassidy said that he
would not ride in the procession unless be
could be in th< sam< carriage with Walsh,
ami thi latter declared that be would not
go if there was a single white horse In the
procession because his hair is red. ThÂ«
committee spent $35 for Invitations and
have ten occupants In sight. Upon mo
tion the matter of the number of car
riages to he engaged was left to ChaJr
man O'Brien.
A communication was received from
Thomas P. Robinson, accompanied by an
affidavit from Frederick Raabe, statins
that he had been falsely accused and that
he had not hpen Riven a fnir trial by the
committee thnt investigated his case. The
communication was read and referred to
the original committee that investigated
the charges. It was remarked that Rob
lnson had been in evidence around the
committee room ever since his dismissal.
Last night he was In the office of the
Grand Marshal, and was apparently run
ning the affairs of the office with the same
complacency that characterized his ad
admlnistration prior to his dismissal. It
apears that Colonel Robinson is very hard
to "shake." The committee will meet
again at 4 o'clock to-morrow afternoon.

MISSION CLUBS.
An Independent Celebration at
Glen Park Decided On.
The, Mission Federation of Improve
ment Clubs at a meeting last night at
Falrmount Hall decided to cut loose from
the Fourth of July committee and have a
celebration of its own on the Fourth of
July at Glen Park.
The reason assigned by the executive
committee of the federation for this step
was what Chairman Guss Schnee charac
terized in his remarks as the unwarrant
ed action of the general committee of the
Fourth of July celebration. The execu
tive comittee of the federation had sub
scribed |187 on the positive understanding
that there would be fireworks in Glen
Park. This agreement was violate;!
the pyrotechnic display was shifted to
other quarters more congenial to those
having the handling of the arrange
ments. Not to be outdone in giving the
Mission people a display the committee
has made full arrangements for a
day and night entertainment on Its own
account. There will bo a ball, a pyrotech
nic display and other sources of amuse
ments for all, free of charge.
The park has been wired and several
electric lights distributed throughout the
grounds which will make the place as
light as day during the entire night.
Having disposed of the Fourth to the
satisfaction of the delegates the Federa
tion proceeded to the election of its offi
cers for the ensuing six months with tho
following result: President, Christ Sta
der of the Fairmont Club; "first vice presi
dent, N. J. Nixon of the West of Castro
Street Club; second vice president, Gus
tave Schnee, of the Sunnyslde Club; re
cording secretary, J. P. Touhey of the
Falrmount Club; Financial secretary, H.
E. Griffith of the Ocean View Club; treas
urer, H. E. Wlnkler of the Holly Park
Club.
The sprinkling of the outside roads was
again brought up by Delegate A. S. Lil
lie, who stated that somefning should be
done by which our outside roadways
might be made at least half-way decent
for persons driving in and out of the city
to San Mateo. Dr. E. N. Torello, presi
dent of the Five-Mile House Improvement
Club, stated that the sprinkling question |
was an impossibility In consequence of
there being no hydrants along the way
side by which water couifl be secured.

After the Honeymoon the Actress

take no chances.
Charles Frohman, und^r whose direc
tion Miss Buckley wood fortune and won
fame in New York arid London, has a
contract with the little lady which reads
"You shall not wed." However, when
the Shasta oil man knocked loud and
long at the tender, trusting Buckley
heart the fetching actress consulted her

The man that even an iron-bound
trical contract could not si
from thi lady of his choice is a Shasta
oil and electrical man, and said to be
; worth at least a million, lie owns the

jknolder In (he Calumet Pot
tery Company, Ohio, one of the largest
pottery concerns in the world, and is alpo
a stockholder in the Calumet and Ilecla

Garlick met Miss Buckley during her
â eason with "The First Born" at the Al
iiizar Tho.iter, and it was a case of lnvo
nc first sight. He followed the lady
when she went East, emphasizing his at
tentions mith numerous valuable gifts.
Finally the Shasta man's perseverance
conquered and In spite of hia fifty y<ars
and pray hairs the young actress Hnked
her fat* with his.
The ainrt-ss stipulated for one condition.
Bhe was to be allowed to continue her
theatric*! career.
This Is Miss Buckley's second matri
monial venture. A little more than a year
ago sh* was divorced from Frank Clay
ton, who was then, irke the lady, a mem
ber of the Alcazar Stock Company. Miss
Buckley continued her career of triumph
on the local stage, and Clayton went with
a road stock company as leading man.
When Bflasco took "The First Born" to
New York and then sent it racing to
London, Miss Buckley went along to play
the role of the Chinese slave girl. Froh
rnan recognized in the California girl un
usual talent and gave her opportunities
I with Annie Russell nnd John Drew. Her
! success with these stars was instantane
ous and so startling that the Napoleon of
managers resolved to score with her In
Tendon. It was then that the deal at
the Gaiety was consummated and the
iron- hound contract permitting no ex
j change of marriage vows was signed and
i sealed.
But love laucrhs at managers and at
contracts, and May Buckley writes her

SUSPECT THE WIFE.
Detectives Think That Mrs. B. F. ,
Fuller Stole Her Husband's
Money While He Slept. j
Detectives Dinan and Reynolds are of
the opinion that the wife of B. F. Fuller, j
who was robbed of $1700 in the Winchester
House, corner of Third and Stevenson .
Btreets, on Thursday night, is implicated
In thÂ« robbery. The couple have left the
city ;lhil are supposed to have gone north.
Fuller, it will be remembered, on retiring ;
left two packages of money in the pock- !
hia coat. When he arose in the i
morning they wore gone. He subsequent-]
ly found one package, containing
upon the steps of the Bre escape. Fuller
was also Inclined to think that hit wife ]
ing to do with the robbery.
He remembered that she got out of bed
about 4 o'clock In the morning, but he
did nut think anything of it at the time, j
The detectives believe that the woman j
had a confederate on the outside, who
was possibly a former hupband, named ;
Hill. Tlvey think . that she threw the
money out to this confederate and that
f the packages fell on the fire
escapi Despite his doubts Fuller says
that he still loves his wife. He is about
thirty er than the woman.
Two Notable Advertisers Visit the
Coast.
Mr. J. T. Wetherold of the bip Boston
Advertising Agency of Pettingill & Co.,
and Mr. C. H. I'inkham of Lynn,
Mass., the head of the Lydia Finkham i
Medicine Company, arrived in the city |
yesterday and are at the Palace. Their
Western trip is a combination business
and pleasure jaunt, and embraces
nearly every city in the Middle West j
and the Pacific States.
Both pontlemen are thoroughly con
vinced that pood times are with the
whole country to stay. Mr. Pinkham.
who has been for many years closely!
in touch with the trade, states that the
rapid revival of all lines of business has
been a revelation to him. The sales of
the Pinkham remedies, which are al
most exclusively to women, have been
larger during the six months of 1899 I
than ever before in the history of the |
company. Advertising agencies pos- I
Bibly feel the Quickening pulse of busi- j
ness more than any other industry in j
the country, and Mr. Wetherold is of j
the opinion that all the leading agen- |
cies, and particularly that of Pettingill |
& Co., will throw a greater volume of i
patronage into reliable publications the
coming year than ever before, all of
which is particularly gratifying to pub
lishers. _. Â â,
Messrs. Wetherold and Pinkham will
take in the city sights and visit Del
Monte prior to going into the Sound
country en route East.

Captain Dyer Visits the Panorama.
Captain Dyer of the Baltimore, wnicn
was next in line to Dewey's flagship, the
Olympia, at the famous battle of Manila
Bay visited the Panorama the other day.
He spent two hours with seemingly great
satisfaction, as before leaving he said to
those with him. "Now you can say you
Paw the battle of Manila Bay." The cap
tain did not reveal his identity until the
lecturer suspecting who he was but not
certain, made a statement to .effect
that to Captain Dyer of the Bait more
was due a large share of the credit for
making the attack just when it took place.
Then it was that the captain, lowering the
glasses through which lie was examining
the Panorama, emphatically disclaimed
any right to share in that manner In the
Klory of Dewey's achievement. Nearly
Iverv day one or more of the returned
participants in the famous. battle visit the
Panorama- â * _
Found It Was Loaded.
Will Buckley, a boy aged 13 years, re
siding on Chapultepec street, had his left
hand dressed at St. Luke's Hospital yes
terday for a gunshot wound inflicted by
himself while celebrating the corning na
tional anniversary of the Independence of
his native land. Young Buckley got hold
of his father's pistol and took it out to
see how it would work when brought into
action His discovery was entirely pads
factors', for he placed his left hand over
the muzzle and pulled the trigger; the
bullet went through his hand, inflicting a
painful wound. He stated that he did not
know it was loaded until the, trial con
vinced him of his error.

Wheelmen are taking a great deal of
! Interest in th< proposed automobile trip
of John D. Davis and his wife across the :

! to a bicycle in some points of construe- j
ftion that the fraternal feeling is quite

I they should watch the progress of . the
j vehicle with great Interest.

HAROLD CLARK IS THE STAR j

SIES IN COMPETITION.

Drives a Golf Ball One Hundred and j
Four Yards at San Rafael.
Medal Play and
Driving.
Though caddies might live without golf.
\ It Is reasonably certain that golf could
i not maintain Its existence without cad
! dies. On the principle that the looker-on j
I often sees most o-f the game, the caddie,
whose business compels him to watch the
play of his patrons. Inevitably acquires j
! an extensive knowledge of what not to |
I do. On the other hand, when he has
| the good fortune to carry for an expert,
j he has an excellent chance to study his
game, and when opportunity offers he
naturally tries to put the results of his
j observation Into practice. Accordingly, j
many boys who have carried for experts j
; become fine players. Recognizing the fact j
that the caddie Is an indispensable ele- j
i ment of golf, the committee of the San '
] Rafael Golf Club determined to give up |
! yesterday afternoon to him. About 2 .
! o'clock a nine-hole competition, medal i
play, took place among the caddies, prizes j
being offered for the two best Bcores.
Harold Clark won first prize with a sore
of 74 and Harry Roberts tuok second prize
with a score of 81. The first prize was ai
! set of clubs, comprising a driver, a bras- ;
sic,- a lofter and a cleek: the second prize |
consisted of a bra.^sie and a cleek.
â  rin the afternoon a driving compe- |
tition was held, in which two prizes were ,
given for the longest balls out of five
drives. The first prize, a brassie, was won
by Harold Clark, with a drive In which
the clear flight of the ball was l'> 4 yards,
\. Uange w;is necond, with a driv<
yards Lange bore off a cleek as ar< war..
of his Bkill.
Some entries have already been made

trieÃ have been made: J. Dennis Arnold,
Clement Arnold, H. P. Sonmair. Harry

j bration in Pan RafaeL

CHILE PINE WILL GRACE
GOLDEN GATE PARK
ARAUCARIA INDRICATA.
I^HROUGH the efforts of Park Commissioner Adolph Spreckels the park Q
will soon have a rare and beautiful specimen of the Chile pine, or i
Araucaria Indricata. The tie- is also known as the "monkey pine" .J.
[ because it is the only tree which cannot be climbed by the Simian Â«
species on account of a ticklish thistle which grows on it. \
Superintendent McLaren sent a force of men yesterday afternoon to the y
residence of R. E. Culbreth, corner of Howard and Twentieth streets, in 4
whose yurd the tree now stands, to transfer it to the pleasure pounds. i t ls +
thirty-live feet high, and in order that no risk mijrht be taken in moving it â¦
It was decided to reroot it in a box tilled with sandy loam. In about three A
months it will be taken to the park, where it will be sure to attract attention
on account of its majestic size. t
It appears that the property originally belonged to W. F. Whlttier, tha T
deceased capitalist, who willed the tree to the park. Bernard Joost bought v
the property and in turn sold it to X. Ohiandt, and the latter centleman will 0
carry out the intentions of Mr. Whittier. 1
It i.s sail that the trees are very scarce in the Tnited States. Timothy -f
Hopkins possesses one. but it ls not as tall nor as fine a specimen as that â¼ |
which will grace the park. It has a peculiar character of its own, is cone- A
shaped and tapers beautifully from thÂ« ground up. It was named after a V
tribe of natives in Chile. X
TOURNAMENT AT
SAN RAFAEL FOR
TENNIS CRACKS
Wjlting Heat During
Preliminary Draw.
LOCAL MEN DISSATISFIED:
PROSPECTIVE INTEREST IN THE |
WHITNEY-HARDY MATCH.
Results of the Games of the First
Day of the Pacific States
Lawn Tennis Asso
ciation.
The annual championship single* of the |
Pacific States Lawn Tennis Association
began Its three days' career yesterday :
morning with the racket-wielding talent
on hand ready for an indulgence In drives,
lobs and smashes. The courts at the
Hotel Rafael were never In better condl- ;
tion and the weather never hotter for thÂ« ]
yearly struggle, in which the best ma- j
terial the State can produce meets on the ]
burning asphalt for championship honors. '
More than the usual quota of interest
Is attached to this tournament on account
of the prospective duel between Sam
Hardy, the pride of Oakland, and George
Whitney, the most able of San. Fran
cisco tennis experts. For the first time In
many years they will cross rackets in a
championship tournament. The wiseacres
of the asphalt are furrowing brows and
picking winners, but few there are who
arc willing to stake silver or gold on the
result of the meeting of these two cham
pions.
The little old man who sold peanuts,
popcorn and chewing candy at former
championship affairs is no more. He now
lies- under the sod, and all that is left of
him is a memory. When the sun wad at
its hottest and the throats of the thirsty
were calling for soothing drinks a word
lor two of regret floated over the courts
} for the gray-haired wizard who furnished
I the icewater lemonade in the days gone
; by.
The entire day's play showed no sur
prises. The tennis was not of the b^Ft,
: merely preliminary matches leading up
to the semi-finals and finals, which will
be played on Monday. To relieve the mo
notony of the early matchep of the tour
nament was a surly acquiescence on the
' p;trt of the California Tennis Club rep
resentatives in the draw and arrange
ments lixod by the committee for the
! tournament schedule. The California
men are in a frame of mind which Is
much akin to San Rafael weather. On
j Thursday night the draw took place, and
;it so happened that none of that club
w. !â¢ j>] sent. The local mc-n claim that
they were drawn so as to me^t one an
other, thus forcing the best of their rep
tatives to waste their strength and
, ability In destroying the chances for a
local vl< tory.
The result of the preliminary matches
is as follows: Grant Smith beat W. Al
len 2â C 6â3, 7â5, Bâ4; Routh beat Pow
ers' 7â5, 6âl, 6âl; Dt. Phillips beat

H. â nly, 6â3, 5â7, 6â3, 6âl; Selby beat John
fhii, 6â4, 6â3, 6â S, 6- 2; weihe beat Nich

6â4, 6â4.
The best match of the tournament will
i be to-morrow, when Hardy meets NVhit
; ney In the semi-finals. Whitney will be
i forced to play two matches before this,
and Hardy the same. The tennis on the
i day of the tournament wLll be the
best seen on this coast for years and is
sure to draw a large crowd.
Divorce Suits Filed.
Solomon A. Kusel filed suit yesterday
agfiinst his wife, Caroline Kusel. for a
divorce, alleging desertion as tho groun-l
ion. Mrs. Kusel recently sued her
husband for maintenance, hut the court
decided adversely to h^r. Charles O. Bent
ska for a divorce from hN wife,
Margaret T. Bentley, on the ground of
desertion.

Palmettos at odds of 9 to 1, defeated
Lowe & Thompson's Patria when they
met In the open stake yesterday. Patria
showed the most speed in the run up,
but the hare swung back to Palmetto, i
which killed. The odds were lengthened
against thÂ© winner apparently as a Joke,
as it was not supposed she had an out
side chance. After the race but few bet
tors cashed, the play being light.
The races throughout the afternoon
were close, the draw bringing together a
lot of evenly matched dogs. Shylock Boy
proved a surprise In his course with
Metallic, pressing the Pasha Kennels'
' representative throughout.
Theron defeated Susie handily, leading
1 up and doing all the work. There was a
big upset when Statesman, at 1 to 3, de
feated Emm Pasha.

CHINESE BELLE ARRESTED.
Suey Yee Is Accused of Einb2zzling
Jewelry From Sew Yung,
Which She Borrowed.
Judge Morgan will be called upon to
morrow to sit in judgment on an Interest
ing case in which both the complaining
witness and the defendant are Chinese
bellt-s, the one accusing the other of em
bezzling Jewelry.
S<>w Yung, who keeps a fancy store at
63* Pacific street, is the complaining wlt
aess. She alleges that on June 30 Suey
Yee called upon her and told her she was
going to-a swell Chinese BOdal, where she
wanted to in;:ke a sensation. She asked
for the loan of different articles of jewelry
with which to bedeck herself, and She
got them.
After the social Suey Yee fled to the
Methodist mission, taking the jewelry
with her. A complaint was made at the
mission and a gold toothpick waa re
turned, but there are still missing a dia
mond ring, three plain gold rings and a
gold tiara, which, it is alleged, Suey Yee
pawned.
Suey Yee waa taken to the City Prison
yesterday afternoon and booked on the
charge, but was released on her own re
cognizance by Judge Morgan, a lady be
longing to the mission having called upon
him and told him that the arrest was
simply a plot to get her out of the
mission.

Christopher Merkle, also known by

charge of burglary, with six "priors'
against his name, is at large. While the
eyes of six deputy sheriffs were supposed
to have been observing his every move he
quietly climbed out of the dock in Judgt
Lawlor's court, walked over the plat
form, passed the Judge's bench, opened
the door leading Into the Jury room,

thence to the corridor and bolted. It was
.lust 10:30 o'clock when the big swinging
doors in the County Clerk's office swung
in with a bang, a breathless man bounded
Into the room, then bounded out again.
Deputy County Clerks Grif and Cun
ningham were of the impression that
pome one had shoved him through the
doors, and his speedy exit caused consid
erable merriment Ten minutes later,
however, a corps of nervous deputy sher
iffs also banged the door open and in
quired if a party who appeared to be in
a hurry had been seen around that way.
They were answered In the aflirmat ivÂ«,
and then went into executive session to
determine just how the escape was ac

before Its correctness can be finally ac
cepted.
A short time later Sheriff Martin was
informed that Mc-rkle. who is said to be
a desperate man, as well as an habitual
crook, had escaped. Owing- to the fact
that the prisoners yet in dock had to be
guarded even more closely than before the
escape a late start in the chase resulted
and inconsequence the wnviet is doubt
less now far on his -.way fr.Â»rri the city.
After he hurried into thf County (.'l^rk'9
office no trace of the .s. a;,, W as f"ind.
and instead of being on his way to prison
for the tefm of his natural lit.- he is en
joying his cleverly earned Liberty.
Yesterday morning before Jn.tge Law
lor convened court fhe long â 'chain-gang'"
left the Sheriff's van and was ,n Its way
to court. Every degree of criminal, from
the murderer to the petty larcoriist;: was in
the shackled line. Merkle being in front.
This crowd of criminals was Kuanled by
Bepu-ty Sheriffs Daly, Haskimv. -Uarray,
Troell Kingsley and another man. Arriv
ing at the dock the steel wristlets were
first taken from Merkle and he Â«:
the dock. Another prisoner followed, and
while the corps: of. deputies were releasing:
the remainder of the line. Merkle s
over the dock to freedom. Some minuses
later a count was ma-do and it was^ found
that there was a prisoner short. The i J\Â°.n
call demonstrated that. iforkle was miss
ing, and then began the. excitement.
Judge . Lawidr was summoned and he in
formed the. escape's, counsel that, under
the circumstances, he would postpone sen
tence for one week. Counsel stated that
he did not believe that he could be in,
court on. the day set, and Judge Lawlor
added that, in his opinion, his client
would not be present either, so they would
arrange matters later".
The Time for which Merkle was to have
been c -.â¢ester'l.iy was committed
on April 12 last. On that date he entered
the apartments of F. A. Dunbar at 134b
Market street and was caught ransacking
the place. Prior to hts conviction on tnts
charge he was convicted on August 3,
1878, of petty larreny under his true name.
Christopher Merkle: on April 2, ISSI, he
whs convicted <rf petty larceny under the
name of James Sullivan; oh November 2,
1881 he was convicted of. petty larceny
under the name of Charles Urown; on
February 14, ISS2, he was. ponvicted : or
burglary under hi.s true name; on Septem
ber 6, ISS4, he was convicted .of ; grand
larceny under his true name r : and on Feb
ruary 2, 1595, he was -convicted of an at
tempt to commit burglary under the
name of Charles Myrtle, owing to these
prior convictions he would have heen sen^
tenced to life impr:ponmÂ»nt yesterday had
he remained to experience the ordeal, but
he preferred liberty and now h<: is. free. ,
The fate which was to have been meted
out to Merklo had he remaint'l in custody
was entirclv in keeping: with his family
history. Several years ago his parents
were arrested and charged with the mur-
, der of a man at Spanishtown.i' : .- -During:.:
I the trial the father, seeing that matters
I were assuming a serious aspect: for .; thÂ«
i mother, started the' court by confessing ..
that he alone committed the deed. . HIS -.'
1 statement was not accepted* however. ' -.
\ The trial progressed and Mrs. iierkle was\ :
| convicted and the father given his liber- - v
ty. Mrs. Merkle is now. serving her sen
i tence in State's prison- Iri September .

NEW YORK, July I.â Terry McGovern

place in the open air and the weather was
â¢fill. The men weighed 115 pounds.
McGovern was a hot favorite and he had
a host of followers, who bet their long
green at short odds on him. He defeated
the Chicago man with a succession of
body punches, followed by a heavy right
cross to the neck.
When the lighters came to the center of
the ring it was seen that the Chicago boy
was finely drawn and pale and looked
anything but a winner. On the other
hand McGovern was as rugged looking
as a russet apple and had evidently gono
through a vigorous course of training.
In the opening round Richie landed a
hard right on the neck. Clinch after
clinch followed, with McGovern boring in,
using both hands on the body, and at the
bell Richie showed signs of weakness.
At the opening of tne second round Me
rced Richie to break ground.
Terry feinted with bia left and dn w
Richie toward him, meeting the Â« hicago
boj with a beautiful ripht on the head
without a return. McGovern saw an
ng and landed twice on the face and
ii. .'k with hia right, downing his opponent

aa fr< sh aa ever- Neither was
winded when ho returned to his corner.
In the last and deciding round, Mc-
Govern allowed Richie to do the Leading.
McGovern showed a greal amount
\ eni< >> in his work. He f
ducked and us*-.! ins legs In side-stepping
erly trial Richie was guessing.
Suddenly McGovern threw Ins left on
the jaw with such force that X â¢
rocked, and like a (lash the little

Richie down and out. Some of the s] -

A NEW DEAL
IN THE POLITICS
OF ALAMEDA
City Employe Sum
marily Dismissed.
PAYING OF ELECTION DEBTS
UNWRITTEN LAWS VIOLATED
BY THE NEW TRUSTEES.
A. V. Fisher Discharged Without
Cause to Make Room for the
Political Friend of a
City Official.
ALAMEDA, July I.â This city is agi
tated from center to circumference to-day
over the Inauguration of a style of poll
tics never before attempted in municipal
j affairs. A faithful city employe, whose
honesty and competency have never been,
questioned, has been unceremoniously
dropped from the city payroll to make
room for the son of one of the political
friends of a City Trustee.
It has been an unwritten law In Ala
meda since the city was incorporated that
the tenure of office of every employÂ© de
pended upon his attention to and his
faithful performance of his duties. Such
a thing as dismissing a public servant for
political reasons was never dreamed of,
and consequently the citizens are very
much agitated over the changed condition
of affairs since the new Board of City
Trustees came into power.
Last night after a secret session of the
Trustees A. V. Fisher, who has been book
keeper and collector of the city electric
light plant for a number of years, was
told that his services would bo dispensed
with at midnight. The excuse given is
that he did not collect enough money
from patrons of the plant during June.
The fact of the case is that he was dis
charged to make a position for Thomas
Thompson, sun of the chairman of the
Harmonic Hall party, which now controls
the Hoard of City Trustees.
According to the assertions of City
Trustee Schulte, chairman of the Electric
Light Committee. Fisher was let OUI "ii
the recommendation of Trustee Mackie. |
who also recommended the appointment
of Thompson.
".Mr Fisher has not fulfilled our expec
tations as a collector," said Mr. Schulte,
"and Mr. Mackie suggested that we lei
him out. He has recommended Thomas
Thompson for the position, and we are
1 going to give him a trial."
Mr, Fisher w;is given no intimation of
hi a discharge; quite the contrary, for when
, The Call stated positively about two
i months ago that he was on t!:>- decapita
tion list of the new lÂ»:iril the Trustees
1 assured him that this paper had no foun
datlon for its assertions "and that be
would not be disturbed in his position. '
i Naturally, his summary dismissal has
created a feeling of uneasiness among the
cfty employes, who are wondering where
the next blow of the ax will strike.
<"ity Electrician Weise will probably be
the nJ-xt man to go. His position has been
offered to a number of well-known elec
-1 trlcians, but none of them wuuld consent
to accept it.
Tlure will probably be a legal tussle '
before Fisher gives up. He was appointed
by the Board of City Trustees. To-day he |
received the following unsigned communl- i
cation in the handwriting of City Trustee i
Mackie:
"The eloetrin light committee has de
cided that your services are no longer re
quired."
The committee has not been empowered .
to discharge city employes, md Fisher
referred his case to City Attorney Taylor.
Mr. Taylor advised him that without
1 authority from the body that >m
ployed him the electric light committee
had no right to dismiss him.
The new appointee is a son of if. A.
Thompson, chairman of the Harmonle
Hall party, on which ticker Mr. Mackie
was the only Trustee elected at the last
municipal election.

WOODLAND, July I.â Upon the con
clusion of the session of the Association

Experiment Stations, on July 7, the dele
gates will start vii /i tour of the State j

of entertainment is anxious to include ,
Woodland in its Itinerary, and Professor!
Emory E. Smith, representing- the com
mittee, was here to-day making arrange- j
ments for entertainments and transpor

Eczema on Head. Got into the EyeÂ«.
Doctor &. Institutes Could Not Cure.
Cured in 2 Months by CUTICURA.
I have been troubled over two years with
eczema on tbe top of my head. It first started to
itch, something tierce. My doctor said it was
eczema, aad treated me for sis month*, with
failure, so I tried more doctors, but they did the
same, I tried a New York institute, which treated
me for six months, but could not reach any further
than the rest. I bad it worse than from the start,
as it commenced to pet in my eyes, and nearly got
me crazy with itching. I -noticed your adver-
tisement In the N. V. World, and thought I would
try Cuticura remedies. In tiro months' time I
did not know that I had any trouble at all, and

Glen Park Lighted.
Glen Park was aglow last night with
Inrandescom and arq lights. The play
ground and the theater building have
.been extensively wired. Among the
other Important features at the Park
is the construction of\ a target range,
which will be- .completed for the Ger
man Turner Festival, to be held at
Glen Park the last week of this month.
In the free theater building the prin
cipal attractions to-day will be the
amateur programme, which will con
sist of singing, dancing, recitations and
prize cake-walking, all by amateurs.
On .the professional programme there
will be Stanley and Scanlon in musical
selections, and comedy by Ed O'Con

There Was No Water.
. The citizens of the Potrero claim that
the fire which destroyed seven houses on
Friday might have been successfully
fought if there had been' a sufficient wa
ter supply. They say that the water
company has neglected to run the proper
mains. The district gets its supply from
the Visitacinn Water Company, .whose
reservoir they claim has been pumped
dry. At the time of the fire mains were
being laid along Indiana street. The
citizens of the Potrero and Southern
Heisrhts have petitioned the Supervisors
to have th.c Spring Valley Water Com
pany extend its mains along the inhab
ited streets, but the plea has been that the
limited population would not justify the
expense. The recent fire, will probably
result in securing a sufficient water
supply.

MEMORY OF DURRANT
REVIVED BY A DEATH
Mrs. Caroline S. Leak. tb<2 Strongest Witness Against
the Strangler, Dies Suddenly.
â¦ Cf\ ra RS. CAROTJN'R S. I,EAK. one of the most Important and sensa
i' w\\ tional witnesses in the trial of Theodore Durrant for the murder
I I y/ \\ of Minnie Williams and Ulanche Umont, died suddenly yesterday
t II /A \\ at her residence, 32.'W Twenty-second street. Mrs. Leak had passed
T. her seventieth year and was very infirm. She went to sleep in her
\ rocking chair yesterday morning and quietly passed away. This woman's
testimony was the strongest and the mosl necessary to forge the links in the
I chain of circumstantial evidence which the prosecution wove around tho no
i torious deg( tirate.
At the time of the tragedy in the belfry of tho Emmanuel Baptist
Â» Church Mrs. Leak resided at 124 Bartlett street, across the way from the
lurch. She was sitting at the front window of her house and saw Durrani
â¦ and Blanche Lamont enter the side, door of the church together on the after
â â¦â  noon on which the murder occurred. That was the last time that Miss La
\ mont was ever seen alive.
The defense made strenuous efforts to break down this testimony, but
4 Mrs. Leak was firm and could not be shaken In her identification of th 3
> prisoner or in her accurate description of the murdered girl.
WHFRE TO GO AND
HOW TO GET THERE
Probably no city \n the TTnion Is so
favorably situated for residents desir
ing an outing as San Francisco. With
in a few hours' ride in any direction
the tired urbanite may find numerous
restful and cool retreats, gratifying
i alike the angler, the hunter and be who
rs the.dolce far niente of life to
more active enjoyments. Especially is
this true of the Bection traversed by the
line of the California Northwestern
i Railway and Its branches. For the
Fourth the company has made a ma
terial reduction in its rates. In fact,
as one passenger expressed It, the trip
is cheaper than walking. On another
page the excursion announcement
shows the charges for round-trip ex
cursions to every desirable locality in
Sonoma and Mendocino counties. A
of <-xtra coaches have
provided and coupled with the su
neripr ferry service, a trip over the
' line cannot fail of pleasurable results.
Information regarding summer re
sort* is obtainable at the company's of
fices either in San Francisco or along
the road. .
UNDERGROUND WIRE SYSTEM.
' The officers of the Merchants' Associa
tion are greatly pleased with what they
accomplished in the proposition to have
all electric and other wires placed under
ground. The ordinance providing for this
improvement has been transmitted to the
Supervisors and with every assurance
that it will become a law. There was some
apprehension that the measure might be
contested by some of the corporations
interested, but the following agreement
sent to the Supervisors, which was
brought about by the association, assures
co-operation instead of opposition:
Having examined the provisions of
the ordinance as submitted herewith
to your honorable board by the Mer
chants' Association, we hereby prom
. lee bo far as our respective companies
or corporations are concerned, that Its
terms will be faithfully complied with.

CANCER OF BREAST.
It Is snli that any lump in a woman's
breast is cancer. Whether true or not,
we knew that thousands die every year
j from cancer in that location. Recently
we have seen and heard directly of
more than twenty bad cases cured by
a Dr. Chamley at 25 Third street, this
city, without knife or pain.
The remedy is new and seems to be
an infallible cure.
He can cure a whole cancerous breast
without cutting-.
One cured is a lady doctor on Ellis
street, a public school teacher on How
ard street, another Mrs. Pickard, 23
Third street, and many other promi
nent people who can be seen by any
body interested.
The doctor sends free a 120-pagre book
on symptoms, with addresses of hun

THIRTY-FIVE
MINT WORKERS
ARE WAILING
They Lost Their Jobs
Yesterday.
UNCLE SAM'S CLEARING OUT
â Â» â
TWENTY-TWO WOMEN ADJUST
EKS IN THE COLD.
Reduced Appropriations for the New
Fiscal Year and Lessened
Work Create a Revo
lution.
A cyclone has struck the Mint and there
ts much wailing. Thirty-five employes,
who have been working regularly and
happily for months or longer and who
are on the civil service list, have been
disi harged.
Twenty-two of them were women â
maidens, widows and wives, who had,
with much worry. Influence and demon
stration of ability, r< ached that much
t-for political haven for women, a
job as "adjuster" In the coiner's depart
ment. Adjusters in the Mint service are
n who make everything just right.
They expertly scrutinize, weigh, count,
etc, the pieces of money that roll out by
the millions and they get J-2 BO a day. The
real were men who get From $M 50 to $1 a
day for doing all sorts of things. Two of
them were classed as cupellers in the
assayer'a department.
Not one suspected that it was coming.
Bach received his pay as u.sual on Fri
day without a look of Intelligence from
the face of the cashier. On that day
thirty-live notes had been mailed to as
maw residences notifying the recipients
that their services would not be required
until further notice. Many received their
notices yesterday. Thai ia th< way and
the proper way In which those things are
done by I ncle Sain, it is well known
that there are enough tears ami whys
around a governm< nt office on such oc
casions without brutally breaking trie
news to the victims along with their
money when they leave the office.
The reason of the cleaning out Is ex
plained by Mint authorities to be due,
first to the lessened appropriation on
which the San Francisco Mint will run
from July 1 and, second, to the rleereasea
demand for small gold and subsidiary sil
\, ; w hi( tiie amount of work.
I- , r the last nscal year the regular ap
propriations for the United States Mint
at Han Francisco were: Forty-on< thou
dollars for statutory officers and
clerks; (41,000 for contingent expenses ajid
â¢' for wages of general employes.
But the revival of business and the needs
paymasters of the army created a
for small gold and subsi
diary silver, and for months last year
the mints were rushed to Bupply this de
.. It takes as many people ana costs
about as much in an operative way to
make a .*â ". piece as it does a double eagle,
and larger mint forces w< re required. On
account of this extra work Congress
mad,' an extra appropriation of ;â .
for all the mints, and about $35,000 of this
went to the Han Francisco Mint, giving
it $185,000 for wages ol operatives. The
San Francisco Mint made a great record
last year in small gold and small silver,
. a 'â :â  aking all annual mint r<
with a total coinage I >r the
calendar year of 18U8, and $63,000,000 for the
fiscal year just cli sed. Its greatest pre
vioua record was iJo.lsti.Oou for the calen
dar y. ar of 1878.
This record was largely due to the enor
mous shipments of British coin from Aus
tralia last year.
Now the 'â â  mand for small com has been
pretty well supplied and receipts of for
eign gold are less. Then for the fiscal
year just beyun the wages appropriation
is $175,000, with no extras, or Jlu.uuO lesj
than last year. It is explained that it wad
to get down to the scale of appropriation
for the now fiscal year and to n les
â if work that the force was so r< -
duced at the close of the fiscal year. It
I be explained that the coinage o:
silver dollars last year resulted in an ex
tra allowance of $30,000, which will prob
ahiy be less this year.
The I employes are under cr. il
service and are really suspended without
pay. When another increase of force re
quires tilling sume or ail ot the vacancies
it will res* with Superintendent Leach to
say who shall I ' 'â¢â  from the wait
ing civil service list. It is likely that Mr.
Leach will reappoint from the discharged
men. but that is for the future.

CAPTAIN BOHEN HOPEFUL OF
CONVICTING HIM.
The Accused Slayer of John Kehlen
beck Recognized as a Profes
sional Beggar â His Rec
ord in Alameda.
Captain of Detectives Bohen is: hopeful
of convicting Dr. Wachendorf of the mur
der of John Kehlenbeck. Last evening he
received the following communication
from (r. F. Weeks, editor of the Daily
Kncinal of Alameda:
[note that you have under arrest one Dr.
Wachendorf charged with niuriK-r, and that
be has a bankbook showing deposits' in the HI-
bernia Bank. If it is necessary to. show that
he was ciea<i hruke about Ist of .Tune I am in
a position to do it. Ha w;is then in Alarneda
and was pretending to be deaf and dumb.
He showed me his diplomas and documents.
be wa? hungry I gave him an. order for
a meal on a restaurant. He said ho had had
nothing to eat for twenty-four hours and told
a very pitiful tale of ht.w he had. been forced
to bes by adverse circumstances. I will go .to |
San Francisco at any time to contribute my I.
share of evidence aeainst him. â¢ Fours Bin- ;

In addition to the letter received from
Weeks, Captain Bohen'ta in possession vt
documentary evidence showing tnai I.
Wachendorf prior to his m^oniitf .with the
alleged victim was a prof essional . beggar.
<i n November 29, 1898, he was arrested by f.
Police Officer Pete Gillen for begging in
front of the Hibemia Hank, and on a
conviction was sent to the House oC. Cor
rection for twenty-five days.
Frequently* it is claimed. Wachehdorf â 
appeared oh Market street with a deaf
and dumb sigrn, and inutel- appealed to .
the passersby for alms: The police say
that the money he then pained, was apent j
for cocaine, which he injected Into his
body. _ . Â .
Detectives Silver and Epan. who have
been specially detailed on the case by-
Captain Hohen. last evening Visit â¢ â ,}
Warhendorfs room and took possession
of his trunks. They were taken to po
lice headquarters and broken open~ Con
trary to the expectations of the detec
tives, nothing of an incriminating nature'
was found. ' â 
While admitting that he was forced to]
bee in order to sustain life. \\ achendoff ]
claims that Policeman Gillen made a mis
take in arresting him; He also denies
that he was convicted of the charge, but
the records of the Police Court show that
he served twenty-five days for soliciting
alms on a public thoroughfare. Captain
Bohen expects to make out a strong case
against him 1n the Police Court, and is :
confident that he will be held to answer j
for the murder of his deluded: victim. â¢ |
Last Sunday Dr. Wachendorf visited thÂ»> â â¢
office of I>r. McNeil a 1 784 Van. Ness ave
nue and abstracted a valuable book. :
which was found last night among the [
cocaine fiend's effects at his room. â  .!

rNSTJRANCE MEN RESPOND.
Will Pay for the Equipments of Ex
tra Fire Companies if thÂ«
City Will Not.
The city will be amply protected from
fire on the Fourth of July, thanks to the
prompt rtJ-por.se made by the insurance
CÂ»cn. When Superintendent HÂ» vitt of the
Fire Alarm and Police Telegraph found
that the appropriation for his department
had been so materially reduced that ho
was forced to let sixty men go he at once
it ported to Chief Sullivan that he was
compelled to stop work upon the equip
ments for the extra companies that arc
always In service during the first wetk in
July. Chief Sullivan immediately called
upon a number of insurance men and laid
th* matter before them, with the result
that they authorized him to employ t*-n
men to complete the work upon the equip
ments. The insurance men have guaran
teed to pay the men if the city will not.
They think It cheaper to pay the bill and
have the city amply protected than to
run the risk of the damage that may re
sult from fires.
Superintendent Hewitt said yesterday
that under the appropriation now allowed
him he had only enough to retain a su
perintendent, three operators and a re
pairer. He stated that it would be im
possible to do the work of his department
with so small a force.

by the Federal Grand Jury.
The Federal Grand Jury announced yes
terday that they had Ignored the charge

ministered- to him by physicians caused
him to become mentally deranged to an
extent so great as to necessitate his dis
charge from the service of the company,
and he was placed in an asylum for the
Insane. On befng released from the asy
lum he was reinstated in his former em
ployment, for he had been in the service
of the company for twenty-five years.

Dorr succeeded Drs. Fltzgibbon, Yon der
Lelth and Fine. If the new surgeons
make as good a record as the retiring men
and their assistants the water front will
be more than satisfied with them. Mrs.
P J. Eddy succeeded Mrs. Annie Andrew
as day matron. A more obliging or more
competent matron than Mrs. Andrew
could hardly be found, and it seems a
pity that politics should cause her re
i moval. During her stay on the front she
| made a host of friends and. in spite of her
I trying position, not one enemy.
Little Mabel Nelson, aged 6 years, was
treated at the Harbor Hospital yesterday
afternoon by Drs. Thompson and . Rice
for a broken arm and a sprained wrist.
She and some other children were playing
in a vacant house when one of them
pushed Mabel downstairs. The child was
taken home to "32 Greenwich street, and
from there was sent to the hospital.
"Jim" Turk and "Paddy" Lynch,, two
"runners',' for sailor boarding-houses in
Portland, .played a trick on the San Fran
cisco . boarding' masters a few days ago
that they will not forget In a hurry. The
runners wanted seven men for an Eng
lish ship and could not get them on the
river or on Puge/t Sound, so they came to
San Francisco and stole them. Five men
they took from Tom Murray's house In a
body and two they, got from Lane's board-
Ing-house. The bait they held out to the
sailors was one month's advance only and
a $15 kit. Murray and Lane did not miss
the men until the steamer State of Cali
fornia was half way to Astoria, and then
It was too late to do anything. Turk and
Lynch will get a $20 advance and $40
"blood money" for each one of the seven
sailors, and out of that they will give the
men a $15 outfit and a couple of dollars
spending money. Between them the run
ners will clear up about $250 and Murray
and Lane are out and injured.

in a star chamber session in the grand

Fred Lees whispered to Sam Dannen- j

semblyman Charlie Kenneally. The j
chairman's seat was vacant, and his i
gavel lay Idle upon the table. Winks were j
exchanged, and Charlie Kenneally squat
ted himself In the vacant chair.
Captain Raabe. who says he never took |
a cent in his life, was outside in the cor- j
rldor of the Grand protesting his inno
cence to George W. Elder.
His fervent oratory' floated Into the j
smoky room and the waiting committee- i
men drank the burden of Fred's tale of j
woe. Even Miss Hopkins, the charming
little stenographer, who has become quite
an attractive adjunct to the committee, \
lifted her eyes from her machine and
cocked an ear to the captains woeful
song:
"It haf bin al-leg-ged dot I om extorsh

"Tell that gentleman outside to come

rapping for order.
Presently Captain Raabe entered and
the gang stifled their laughter. Every

"t 'attain Raabe, how much money dtd

"Never mind how much I reclef," re

Not a Federal Holiday.
The suggestion was made recently to
the Secretary of the Treasury that he
should give permission to close the Cus
tom-house on Monday, July 3, the day
before being Sunday and the day after
being "the glorious Fourth."
This arrangement would have enabled
the Federal attaches and the brokers to
rusticate from yesterday afternoon until

retary wired that he would not grant the
required permission, and the Custom
house was In mourning yeaterday by rea

KEPT AWAY FROM

McNaughton Evades the
Committee.
HIS INVITATION TO THEM
SAYS HE CAN BE FOUND ANY
DAY AT THE SCHOOL.
San Jose's Normal School Professor
Again Declares His Innocence
of the Charges of Im
morality.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, July I.â Professor James
McNaughton, principal of the State Nor
mal School, failed to appear before the
committee appointed by the Alumni As
sociation to investigate his character. In
stead a letter was received from Mc-
Naughton, in which he refused to appear
and be investigated.
He stated he is now keeping regular
hours at the Normal School, where he
will be pleased to confer with any persons
Interested in matters pertaining to the
welfare of that institution. He said it
was currently reported that the commit
tee had permitted rumors in its posses
sion, that were derogatory to his charac
ter, to be given publicity without giving
him an opportunity to defend himself.
and "as the conclusions of the committee
could in no way be final, therefore in pur
suance of my ideas of self-respect and of
the dignity of the position I now hold, I '
must respectfully decline to appear before '
your committee. However, I most ear
nestly and respectfully request you to pur- â 
sue your Investigation of my character !
to your satisfaction and to present the re
sults thereof to the Board of Trustees of
this institution, as 1 shall request of
them a most searching and thorough in
vestigation of the whole matter and will
be ready at all times to vindicate myself
before them."
The committee was on hand at the ap
pointed hour to meet .Mr. McNaughton,
according to the Invitation extended him.
but this afternoon they deny that they
were disappointed by his failure to ap
pear. They claimed they had been in
formed that McNaughton had declared he
would not go before them. The commit
tee say they will go right on with the In
vestigation now and in a few weeks may
have some interesting facts for the prin
cipal to refute.
THE NATIONAL GUARD
OF CALIFORNIA
NAVAL MILITIAMEN ORDERED
ON A CRUISE WITHOUT PAY.
Three Regiments Are Now Officially
Recognized â Some Sharp Talk
at a Banquet.
The adjutant general has issued orders
to Captain Turner, commanding the
Naval Militia, to place himself in com
munication with the commanding officer
of the United States steamship Badger
upon her arrival in San Francisco to ar
range the necessary details for the pro
posed cruise. This cruise and drill Is to
be for not less than seven days and the
dates are arranged as follows: July 23
the first and second division and the en
gineer's division are to board the vessel
at San Francisco; the fifth division at
Eureka, will be taken on at Eureka on
the 25th; the fourth division will be taken
on at Santa Cruz on the 4th of August
and the sixth division at Santa Barbara
on the 6th of August. The cruise will be
so arranged that as soon as the men of
any division shall have served seven days
they are to be returned to the point at
which they embarked. TTie programme
will include ship routine, gun point and
actual target practice. The men will not
be allowed any per diem while they are
on the Badger, but sustenance will be fur
nished by the State. In other words the
Btatfl expects that each man of the :
militia will devote seven days on the
cruise without any compensation to en
able him to pay the man he would have
to put In the place where employed dur
ing the seven days' absence. When men
are ordered into an encampment they are i
allowed $2 per day, but why the' men!
should be ordered on a seven days' cruise, ;
which is equal to an encampment, with- ,
out compensation, is somethtng that may
be clear to the high military authorities,
but It is not to those who are ordered out.
The allowance to the mlllfla will be based
on the proportion of men who report for
duty on the Badger. >
The division commander and staff un
derwent Inspection i last Thursday night,!
Lieutenant Colonel 'Murphy being the In- j
specting ojicer. The inspection was <.
"highly satisfactory. 1 '
Applications have been received for <
elections In the naval militia vice Lieu
tenant Henry Peterson, term expired;
vice D. H. Hunt, commanding the sixth
division, term expired; vhce Ensign W. E.
Muller of the fourth division, term ex
pired; vice Lieutenant Otto and Lieuten
ant (junior grade) Smith of the fifth di
vision, terms expired.
Companies E of Santa Paula and H of
Ventura, both of the Seventh Infantry, !
having failed to report under the pro- |
visions of the recent act of the Legisla
ture, have been disbanded and all the men '
and officers except Captain A. W. Browne, i
who has been placed on the retired list, I
have been dishonorably discharged from
the service of the State.
A sufficient number of companies having
reported for duty in the Fifth. Sixth and |
Seventh regiments of infantry under the !
recent act of the Legislature in relation
to reorganization, such regiments are rec-
ognized as part of the National Guard and
returned to duty.
C. L. E. Wenk has been re-elected cap
tain of Company E, Oakland, of the Fiith j
infantry, and C. Covalt second lieutenant
of the same company.
Company D. San Rafael, Fifth Infantp'.
has elected V. J. B. Cheda captain, vice
Elliott, who declined a renomination, and
| Joseph P. Barron. second lieutenant, vice
Kerrigan, who failed to qualify.
At the reception and banquet recently
tendered to the adjutant-general at bri
gade headquarters of the Second Brigade,
i there was considerable freedom of speech
I when those present were caJied upon to
speak a piece. Some of the remarks
brought about one from the adjutant-gen- j
eral to the effect that while he had not i
been in office long enough to fully under- ,
stand the way things are managed, he j
however did know that it is the duty of ,
I subordinates to obey and not criticize. A
j remark made by one of the speakers, ]
which, in substance., was that the Na
tional Guard Is a back number, brought a !
retort from the brigade inspector. Major
Jansen. who said that the guard is not a I
back number, that the men are all right, i
I but that a number of the officers are back |
i numbers, because they are careless in the ;
I performance of duties. That the guard is j
not more progressive he thought was due j
to the fact that some officers are neglect- j
ful. "If they were not," he said, "it
would be impossible to lose property be
longing to the State and be unable to find
any one responsible for the loss."
THE NIPPON MARU
FUMIGATED AGAIN
STATE HEALTH OFFICIALS
HAVE THEIB WAY.
The Inspected Japanese Liner Towed
Out Near Mission Bock and
Subjected to Chemical
Fumes.
Satisfied with the incense of their own j
fumigation issuing from the hatches of j
the Nippon Maru the Health Board wUI j
allow that steamer to come alongside j
the Mail Dock some time to-day to dis- j
charge her cargo. At present she is out j .
in the stream between the dock and Mis- j
sion Rock, having been towed there by j
the tug Sea King, W. B. Curtis, manager j
of the Toyen Risen Kaisha Company, j
having signified earlier In the day, under j
! protest, that he would comply with the i
I desire of the State quarantine officials to j
' smoke out suspected microbes.
Quarantine Officer Cohn and Inspectors !
! Benjamin. Johnson. Krone and Eager, af- i
i ter loading the tug with the formalde- j
jnyde apparatus and sulphur enough to:
j supply the most torrid hereafter, saw the i
; steamer towed out to the quarantine i
ground. Then they boarded the Gover- j
| nor Perkins and took a run alongside to 'â 
] superintend the fumigation. It was done |
! thoroughly by 5 o'clock in the afternoon, !
i and when the Health officers came back
they announced that the steamer would, j
probably be allowed to dock some time
this evening. As soon as she does it is
' the Intention of the agent of the com
! pany to get the cargo out as quickly as i
i possible. In order to do this it will be !
necessary to employ double crews.
While Dr. Cohn and his men were fumi
gating the Maru Dr. W. B. Coffey of the :
Health Board, Health Officer Lawlor and |
Dr. James M. Gassaway of the Marine
Hospital went over to the Federal quar
antine station at Angel Island, where the
passengers and crew of the Nippon Maru |
are being detained. They met Dr. Kin- j
I youn and had a chance to see how his
j charges were cared for. On his return !
! Dr Lawlor said that the passengers and ;
' crew were well, but the accommodations
I were insufficient.
In regard to the bubonic bacilli said to
! have been found by Dr. Barbat in the
! blood of the Japanese drowned while try
j ing to escape from the Nippon Maru. a
person signing himself "B. Welwyn Ash- I
' ley, formerly staff surgeon major, her j
Majesty's Indian Medical Department, " i
j says that the bacilli are probably those
.of another dreaded but not infectious
: disease, which is not uncommon.

KEATING'S TRIAL
PROVES A FARCE
I Hospital Scandal Is
Investigated.
FINAL ACTION IS DEFERRED
WITNESS IGNORES AND DEFIES
' , . A SUBPENA.
; Matron McDonald Not Permitted to
| Tell All She Knows, While
the Warden's Story Is
Uninterrupted.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
.... 90S Broadway. July 1.
The fat.- of William J. Keating, warden
of the insane at -the Receiving Hospital!
whose conduct and participation in a fistic
encounter with Isaac Barnett. over the
tatter's : young daughter has been under
Investigation, will probably be determined
by the Board of Supervisors next Wednes
day morning.
Keating's trial before the Supervisors
this morning proved a decided farce. Hart
North, the man who fathered Keating's
j appointment, appeared asa prominent lis-
I tener and the defense was conducted by
j Attorneys George Reed and Fred C. Clift.
! District Attorney Allen questioned the
j witnesses for the board.
! .The trial had been Bet to commence at
! 2 o'clock, at the request of Supervisor
â  Church, who, however, did not put in an
appearance until 3 o'clock, and after Dr.
C L. Tisdale had given testimony.
Supervisor Wells had previously op
posed proceeding in the absence of Super
visor Church and owing to the absence
also of Miss Kitty Welch, who was con
sidered a formidable witness against
Keating. "This affair is a rank farce,"
said Mr. Wells. "I came to attend a full
board. I am surprised, too. to learn that
this Miss Welch can't be found. At any
I rate, I am quite ready to vote In this mat
ter without further testimony."
j .Then followed talk of whitewash, post
r pbnement and partiality.
The first important witness was Miss
i Selma Barnett, the 19-year-old daughter
' of Isaac Barnett of 110 Fifth street, whose
keeping company with Keating had In
, duced her father to visit the hospital one
night three weeks ago and attempt to
thrash the warden.
Witness gave her age as 19 years, and
the gist of r story was that there had
been | nothing Improper between the â¢ ward,
en and herself. She said "the row arose
over the fact that her father didn't want
me to go with Mr. K*eating." She denied
ever having called at the hospital after
9 o'clock. of evenings or that she was ever
in Heating's room in his company with
. the door locked. She claimed she went
there frequently to visit a feeble-minded
girl and secure magazines and papers
from the warden. She admitted having
1 met Keating at street corners and that
.he presented bouquets to her. Her testi
mony was also favorable to Keating.
Isaac Barnett, the young lady's father,
was next called and 'reiterated his story
of the fight on' the hospital lawn; how
he bad warned his daughter not .to keep
company with and meet Keating.
"1 also warned Keating." continued
j Harriett, "and when I learned it was be-
I ing unheeded I called at the hospital and
demanded an interview with this man.
He told me he didn't have timeâ not even
three minutes. Then I told him he would
1 soon walk. the streets, for I would tell
the Supervisors. Then he called me a
'Sheeney' and said 1 couldn't do any
thing. I had nothing against Keating
personally, only I believed he was too'
intimate with my daughter."
Barnett denied a statement made by
Keating in print that the girl came to
tho warden to seek sympathy because she
was treated cruelly by her father.
Mrs. J. Dolan corroborated Bar
nett's latter denial, and Drs. Stratton and
Samborn testified that they had never ;
seen anything improper at the hospital or
In Keating' a conduct.'.
â¢Sheriff Rogers was next called to tell
how he had been frustrated in supenaelng
Kitty Welch. When he called at the
â¢Welch' residence the girl had locked the
door and â¢ concealed herself. Later her
father. Dennis Welch, also" testified 'that
his daughter denied the published state
ment wherein she is said to have declared
thai Keating acted improperly with her
(in a certain occasion. Welch' Bald, too;
that he would not allow his daughter to
attend as a" witness.
Tho star witness of the investigation
was next called' in â Miss Battle McDon
ald, matron at the hospital. She told of
having frequently seen Selma Burnett

and Keating together In thÂ« latter' s room.
aN" described the fight between
Barnett and the. warden. A question as !
to T whether^ she had ever seen anything
in Keating unbecoming a gentleman was
ruled" out.
, Matron McDonald. next "jt.pVd - of iwmer
â¢us complaints made to "her/by women pa
tients Who claimed Keating had insulted
them. "One of these," said the matron,
' "was Mrs. Mary Leach! held for insane.
She told me Keating had insulted her and
that the had ordered him out of her room,
tolling him she was a married woman.
Mrv. Leach was not committed to an asy
; lum."
Supervisor Church now took witness in
; hand and for a time she was virtually
bulldozed and it appeared as though she,
; and not Keating, was under investiga
tion. Witness admitted sin- -was unfriend
. ly with Keating because of numerous mis
understandings. She Wftfl out short when
she attempted to relate what Miss Kitty
Welch had told her about Keatlng*s con
duct to her.
[ Steward Borchert of the hospital testi
i fled that the whole trouble was brought
-about owing to Harriett's visit to the hos
pital. He said thai the other members of
the family frequently called there to use
the telephone.
Isaac Barnett Jr. was the next witness
corroborating his father's story. When
asked by Supervisor Mitchell as to the i
objection against Keating and his sister I
"keeping company, witness replied: "Ow- i
ing to their nationalityâ that of Jew and
Gentile. Gentiles do not frequently marry
Jews.'
Warden Keating was next put on the
rack. He vigorously declared that the!
relations between himself and Miss Bar
nett had been purely those of friendship.
) He testified that on the night of his en
l counter with Barnett the latter had ac
> cused him of having ruined his daughter; I
; that Barnett called him vile names and â¢
â  struck him; thai after the row the girl
I came to him at the hospital again, but
j he had advised her to go home.
"As to the Kitty Welch affair," con
tinued Keating, "she was attending her
! mother at the hospital. One day i met
| her in the sinkroom and she was cracking
I Ice. She told me her lips were sore and
i jokingly 1 suggested that some girls use
i 'two-lip' salve." Witness admitted he
had put his foot against the door and said. |
"All who pass here must pay toll," but I
I said that he was "joshing." 'â¢
Warden Keating was permitted to tell
his story without an interruption save
one, and when that was made Supervisor
| Church noted thai "it came from the
other side of the house.." Supervisor
Roeth took exception to the remark, de
; claring there were no two sides to this
j investigation. Both he and Mr. Wells
i expressed their readiness to submit the
; fate of Keating to a vote, but on motion
\ of Supervisor Talcott, "the whole matter
! was taken under consideration until next I
j Wednesday morning." â  â â 
Friends of the warden are working
! tooth and nail to Insure his retention.
\ and it is believed now thai Keating is
; almost certain of the votes of Talcott
.Mitchell and Church.

it being the intention of the board to
permit the accretion of such a fund
until it might be used in some signifi
cant way for the benefit of the blind;
and whereas, when Mr. Joseph Sand
ers was succeeded by Mr. Hays be
checked the said fund over to Mr.
Hays as ex-offlcio trustee; and where
as, when Mr. Sanders succeeded Mr. â 
Hays, on June 1, 1R99, and subsequent
ly thereto he requested that said fund
be cheeked back to him. Such request
has not been complied with, and. upon
â  inquiry at the bank, it Is found that
Mr.- Hays checked the said fund out
in the spring of 1896; therefore be it '
Resolved, That the secretary of this
b< ird be and he is hereby ordered to
request of Mr. Hays the Immediate
' 'restitution Of said fund, and that he.
.transmit with ' his request a copy
hereof. . '
Colonel Hays says there was only about
$30 in the fund when, he took office, and
he used it in a proper way.
â¢â I see the board hal requested the re
i turn of this money," said ex-Superintend,
ent Hays to-day. "It was spent to help
the unfortunates, and a portion of it was
spent in burying one of the blind men.
i The vouchers for the expenditure are all
' on file at the home."
EATING SHRIMP SALAD

With Violent Illness.
AT.AMKI'A. July 1. Mrs. J. X. Beck

mann's condition was serious, and l>r. K.
M Keys waa -cut for. }(â¢â  pronounced

that had Mrs. Becfcmanh not taken
the emetic promptly fatal results would
have followed.

Rescinding Its Contract With
the Crocker Company.
The H. S. Crocker Company will enjoin
the Board of Education from signing a
contraci with Qinn Â«X: Co. to furnish copy
books for the next two years. The board
recently rescinded its contract with the

declared that the contract with the
Crocket Company had not been drawn up
in accordance with law.
Superintendent Webster is said to have
reported the Creeker copy-books to be un
satisfactory, and this, it is said, led to
the rescinding of the contract with th>
("rocker Company, which was tor four
years. The company has now a two
years" supply of the books pn hand, and
hs the action of the hoard means a bier
loss to the concern, the hoard will ba en

REV. MR. LAW
GIVES NOTICE
OF DEPARTURE
Sensational issue of
"Choir and Nave."
HE WILL NOT PREACH TO-DAY
A LONG FAEEWELL. BUT NOT A
WORD FOR VALENTINE.
The Rector Announces That He Will

Says His Record Can
not Be Beat.

lei ters foi thi I 'holr and Nave."
One-half of the pamphlet is devoted to
a self-lauOatory resume of the rector's
wirk since he Went to the church,, and he
chalh nges any rector in the tli"L-Â«_.-o to
show as good a record.
The article is in the nature of an obitu
ary. It says:
"Sine.- tu- was taken with nervous pros
tration, th. ith of October last and fol

"The rector has had full charge of the
choir as choirmaster during the whole

URGED TO SELECT

MANUFACTURERS FULL STRONG
FOR HOME INDUSTRY.
F. A. Vanderlip Frbmises to Care
fully Investigate the Material,
for the New Postoffice.
The executive officers of the- Manufac
turers' and Producers' Association' -.have
been hard al work for months past to
have 'I"' new Federal structure, known
as the new. postoffice building, constructed
of material quarried in this. State. Fpr a
time It appeared that their ' efforts would
fail, and thai the grranite of distant Maine
would be used in the San Francisco
building. â  â¢ . :
Thai all kinds of "polls" ;irc being ex
erted at Wtshington and that if the- l>iÂ«.
contract goes Bast some one will be
greatly benefited In a pecuniary way is
L r ' p. rally conceded. . â  â¢ .
II i> to offsei these Influences that the
association's members are striving-- so
hard. The latest'move made t" this end
was a communication sent by Manager
Goodwin, by direction of the directors, to
Hon. F. A. Variderllp, Assistant Secre
tary of the Treasury, riow-at thÂ«- Palace
Hotel, calling to his attention the Impor
tance of this subjeel to the people of the
State. He says it is not the purpose >>t'
the association to espouse tin- cause at
any particular bidder, but to urge upon
broad grounds that the producing Inter
ests of this State sho.ula be recognised
in cases like this, where the Federal Gov
ernment is about t>> make an expenditure
df public money for the purpose of pro
viding a public utility for the people of
this city and State. Continuing he' says:
We believe that a fair and impartial
investigation of the resources .of Cali
fornia in this respect, which ws feel
sure from our knowledge of your
Career and reputation as a public off!-,
cial will be made, will convince you
that the building mat-rial for the San
Francisco Postofflce can and should. b<
quarried in this State, and lik< wise that
the policy heretofore followed by the
Government in pursuance of the
wishes of the people as expressed in
Congress by which the manufacturing
and producing interests of the ci ast
have been favored In competition with
the Easi in tenders for the construc
tion of war vessels by a differential of
l \u-r cent in price is one to which no
fair-minded citizen of the country may
take exception and is a concession to
which ibis coast is justly entitled.
You are about to Investigate a mat
ter Involving the expenditure of a
large slim ot money, contributed by
the people of the country â¢'' lai-.ue for
a public building, and wÂ« .believe that
you should be in receipt of Information
as in the feelings of the mercantile
community In this city who are deeply
Interested In this building and who
have no particular lnt< rests in the In
dividual bidd< rs,
Mr. VanQerlip's reply, as here given,
was very satlsfactorj to the association:
Dear Sir: I have the honor to ac
knowledge your letter of June 27 re
eardtng the selection "f grrahlte for the

Regent White insisted that the subject
me of great Importance and that
some one si able to account for
the excessive expenditures.

the Michigan ITniverslty and $125, from

who would be attracted elsewhere by

Resolved. That that portion of the ;

so far as any action of this board is
concerned, is hereby rescinded.

Regeni Hallidie spoke in op]
esolution. He caused some surprise
by producing the record to show thai the
Michigan University exacted a tuitioi
He said twenty-one of the State univer
sities charged an admissii n fee. Th< fee

nia University was $35 a year. If w<
a sweeping rule not to charge â â¢'â â â 
rnedicat department, now charging $100,
be Includi d i xemption.
"To a certain degree," -aid Mr. Hallidie,
"â :â¢â â¢ education is a. political and moral
obligation. Inn beyond this educa- I
tion is a privilege. In fact, the poor peo- i
: y the taxes and the burden of free
education falls on the poor. Whether the
called tuition or registration fee |
the students of the University of Califor
nia .-hou'd. as do the students o.f o ber
great collej tribut< somi thii
the support of the university."
The discussion of the topic was pro-
M. White spoke squarely
against the proposition to impose a tax.
He remarked that it was an advertised
proposition. The peopli of the State were
familiar with the question and were op
po ied to the tax on principle.
Judge Waymire spoke of his own
course in voting against the tax hitherto,
bui called to the mind of his hearers that '
the university was imposing a tax on the
students in th<- laboratory, chemical and
mining departments. He believed it
would be more equitable to levy a uni
versal fee than tax one class of students
and exempt another.
Speaker Alden Anderson referred to his
voie in th<- Legislature in favor of the
2-cent tax and mentioned that his con
stituents applauded his course. He sail!
the people in his community were now
against the proposed ihx. They were op
posed to i! on principle.
Dr. Rowell declared that the students
in the scientific departments who were
now taxed ami always had been were the
least able to sustain the burden. His
Idea whs to eliminate the laboratory tax.
Speaker Anderson mentioned the State
Board of Examiners n* a. source of relief
in-the-eveni of a deficit. Judge Wallace
saw the importance of the suggestion and
sought to obtain from the Governor a
hint that the Hoard of Examiners would
entertain a proposition to grant relief.
The Governor was on his guard and did
mmit the board to a. promise.
Judgi Slack proposed to refer the whole
subject matter again to the finance com
presenting in the reference a sug
gestion that the sense of the hoard was
against a tax on students.
ent Kirk apprehended that this i
would leave the question unsolved.
The roll was called on Regent Foote's
proposition to rescind the tax.
Lieutenant Governor Neff, in explana- 1
tlo'n of his vote, said he had found it a I
-â 'i'\ rule: in life, when hÂ« was not famil
.:â .â  with a proposition, to be guided by the
lurigmcnt of a committee that had given
the subject thorough investigation. There
tore he icoted. "l>o."
Mr. Neff's vote in .opposition to the
stand taken by Governor Gage created
om'ment.
â¢When -Regent Hallldle's name was
called he began to .explain his vote, but i
thje. explanation embodied so .many ref
erences to the constitution ana the
organic act of -the university that a point
of or.der w^ls Faised 'against â  him. The
chair advisor! . Mr. .Hallidie to vote, and

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JULY 2, 1899.
this addition the committee consisted of
Hallidie, -Miller, Houghton, Slack, Demcke
and Rowell.
Before the special business was dipposed
Of many of the regents were apprised of
the fact that Kemamin lde AVheeler or
Cornell had been heard from. Judge Wal
lace, being extremely anxious to present
to the regents, and conceal from the pub
lic, the contents of a communication from
the newly elected president, moved that
the board go into executive session.
Th< secret session lasted for more than
an hour. It tra-nspired that the commit
tee appointed at the last meeting to in
form Dr. Wheeler of his election to the
presidency at a salary of $10,d00 per an
num received a reply from him Betting
forth that he would not consider the offer
unless the regents agreed to certain con
ditions. Four demands are presented by
Dr. Wheeler. He stipulates:
Firstâ That he shall have the power to
apjwlnt and dismiss professors and in
structors, and that his recommendations
shall be sustained by the Board of lie
gents.
Secondâ That all communications from
the faculty to the Board of Regents shall
pass through his hands.
Thirdâ That he shall have the power to
fix the compensation of instructors: that
salaries shall not be increased or dimin
ishf-d. except upon his recommendation.
Fourthâ -That the hoard, after deciding
to support the president, must not with
draw the support.
The reading of the communication as
tounded several of the regents. The per
emptory tone of the letter was more re
markable than the demand for almost
absolute authority. Judge Wallace was
so much taken back by the brusque style
of the document that he did not hesitate
to asset! that if he had seen the letter
b( fore he registered his choice for presi
dent he would not have cast his vote for
1 >r. Wheeler.
The letter is quite extended. Reference
is made therein to the action of the re
gents In promoting; a professor against
the president's recommendation to the
contrary. The allusion to 1,. Dv Pont
promotion was ho obvious thar the
blood of Washington in the veins of Re
geni Foote grew warm. The regent voiced
his sentiments so that the neighbors know
how he stands on the question of allowing
Dr. Wheeler to lord It over the board.
Dr. Whoeler is obviously posted con
cerning affairs at Berkeley. He remind
ed the regents that if he accepted the
office of president ho would have no body
guard around him. The news must have
â¢ 1 Cornell that President Kellogg
has a bodyguard at Berkeley and that
the guard consists of favored professors.
The regents had a high <>I<] time in
discussing the pointed letter. General ;
Harms was the presiding officer during
the discussion and kept tin* talk within
parliamentary bounds. Some of the re- '
gents contend that Wheeler's demands
are not extraordinary, in view of the ex
isting conditions at Berkeley, but they
hold that his direct style of expression in
dicates that tad is not one of hi* leading
quality s.
The discussion developed ;i purpose on
the part of the board not to surrender
the right of the State to govern the uni
versity. The demands of Dr. Wheeler
were not denied or granted. Tn truth
the regents fenced. They decided to in
vite Dr. Wheelei to come to Sun Fran
cisco .it the Â« vp.'iise of the board and
talk over the matter.
Regeni Arthur Rodgers, who posse; â 8
enough for two men, was elected to
correspond with the newly chosen presi
dent. He will tone down the expression
of surprised regents and exalt the possi
bilities of the university. It will be his
duty as correspondent to inform I >r.
eler that the board is ready to meet
him in a generous and frank manner to
talk over the suggestions contained in the
communication.
It transpires that Dr. Wheeler submit
ted his conditions to Mrs. Hearst, whom
-;a in New York last week. The re
port (nines that she is willing, as a re

LAID A CURSE
ON HIS FATHER
IN HIS WILL
Dr. Hinkle's Strange
Legacy.
BROODED OVER A CRUEL KICK
OUTRAGE WHICH THE WIDOW
TRIED TO CONCEAL.
Now Mrs. Hinkle, to Protect Her
Rights, Is Filing the Instru
ment for Probate in
This City.
The will of Dr. Henry Conrad Hinkle
which was filed for probate yesterday
opens a chapter in the history of the Hin
klo family which the young wife alruos
lost her inheritance by trying to conceal
EÂ»r. Hinkle was very well known in thÂ»
city a.s a member of the National Surgi
cal Company, doing a business which wa
worth about $35,000 a year. The firm con
sisted of Dr. Henry Hinkle and his father
Dr. J. M. Hinkle, who now lives at 150
Franklin street, Oakland.
About three years ago, owing to a dis
agreement as to business methods, father
and son decided to dissolve their business
relations. To this end the younger man
removed to Victoria, B. ('.. and there mar
ried the lady who ia named as beneficiary
In the will.
After his father had continually post
poned the settling of the business his son
came back to San Francisco to attempt
to compel his father to make a settlement; ;
' and ifive him his share of. the business ;
! property. A violent quarrel ensued, In '
| which the elder man kicked his son In
the most cruel manner and caused an ill- j
ness from which Dr. liinkle never re- !
covered. With his wife, who wished to
have no scandal and preferred rather to j
give up any money which might belong
to them. Dr. Hinkle went to Seattle.
There he attempted to resume his*
medical profession, but on account of ill j
health could do but little, and finally, I
July 13. ]85Â»7. died there. The Coroner of
Seattle was called to determine the cause
of Dr. Hinkle' s death, but. although he
expressed a great many doubts, no fur
ther investigation was ordered and tho
body was buried.
In the will which Dr. Hinkle left and j
which it was not possible for Mrs. Hinkle
to tamper with without destroying the '
validity of the will, was the sentence:
I leave to J. M. Hinkle my undying curse
for the wicked k!ak in the bowels which he
Rave me to-day. â *
.â¢' Mrs. Hinkle showed the will to her
husband's brother-in-law, Mr. Ames, and
It was agreed that she should have what- '
ever property there was belonging to her â 
deceased husband without filing the will.
This was agreed to most willingly by all
her husband's family, as they, particu- ]
larly his father, wished to keep the bitter j
quarrel and its results a secret.
After a short time Mrs Hinkle was told
that the property was so mortgaged that
it would not be worth the expense of get
ting possession. She has been ill since her I
husband's death, and only three days ago
found that A. H. Truman, an agent of her |
husband's father and brother-in-law had
applied for letters of administration on
her husband's estate, swearing there was
no will and that his family were his heirs.
Hence" Mrs. Hinkle was obliged to pro
tect herself and tile the will.
Since putting the matter in an attor
ney's hands it is found that the estatte
will be at least $13,000 in value, all of
which should go to Mrs. Hinkle.
Following Is the full text of the will:
SAX FRANCISCO February 19. 1897.
I. Harry Conrad Hlnkie, being- in my right
mind, do will and bequeath to my sincere
friend, Margaret Ay res Hinkle, all the goods
and property of which I may die possessed,
requesting her that she may give to my
sister, Evelyn H. Ames, such part of that
property as she may consider just. I own
one-lialf Interest In the eighty acres, sec
tion 10, near Briggs' orchard, Tulare County.
Cal. I own one-third interest in all notes
now out In name of A. H. Truman, payable
at No. 319 Bush street. San Francisco. My
clothing I give to the poor, preferably those
in prison. 1 leave to J. M. Hinkle my un
dyin:.' curse for the wicked kick In the
bowels which he gave me to-day. May God
give rest to my weary soul. In the name of
God, amen. HARRY CONRAD HINKLE.
STREET WORK SUGGESTIONS.
Superintendent Fragley Makes a
Number of Recommendations to
the Supervisors.
The performance of the following street
work was recommended to the Board Of
Supervisors yesterday by Street Superin
tendent Fragley:
I'avins: Shrader strrer. from Waller to
Frederick, with bituminous rock: also
Washington street, between Laurel and
Locust.
Laying artificial stone sidewalks on east
side of Flllmore, between HaiÃht and
Waller: also on south side â if Haight, be
tween Fillmore and Steiner; also on Wil
low avenue, between Franklin and Gough.
Laying plank sidewalks on west sid.- of
Fifth avenue, between Clement and Cali
fornia streets south.
It was aiso recommended that Warren
& Malley be granted an extension of
ninety 'days' time in their contract to
macadamize Steiner street, from Chest
nut to Francisco streets; also ninety days'
time to same on contract to macadamize
Pierce, between chestnut and Francisco:
The full acceptance of the following
streets was also recommended: Laurel,
from Washinpton to Jackson, basalt and
bitumen; and Alabama, from Twenty
third to Twenty-fourth, bitumen.
UNLAWFULLY KILLED GAME.
More Lawless People Punished for
Violating the Statutes.
The- violators of the pame laws in sev
eral parts of the State are beginning to
learn a few things about what is on the
statute books, and. more than that, they
are paying dearly for thoir knowledge.
A few days ago four men were heavily
fined in Mondoclno County for killinp;
ilo-r out of season, and their deer meat
cost them enough to keep their families
for several mouths. Yesterday the State
Fish and Game Commissioners were in
formed by their deputies, members of the
Santa Clara Fish and Game Association,
that another party had paid the penalty
uf shooting out of season.
The man was fined $4o for killing; doves
before the proper time. Had he waited
for two weeks, when all hands would
have had a chance, there would have
been no trouble for him. To the war
den in that district the fellow stated
that he had had all of the shooting he
wanted for many months. The sports
men in Santa Clara are watching care
fully for violators of the law, the deter
mination being that no one shall violate
the laws if vigilance will prevent it.
The Lady's Adventures.
The brilliant production of Anthony
Hope's romantic comedy. "The Adventure
of the Lady Ursula," by Henry Miller and
the special company at the Columbia The
ater, is to be continued for another week.
The demand for the play has surpassed
all expectations and every one of the re
maining performance?, including the spe
cial holiday matinee on Tuesday, July 4.
should command a crowded house. Mr.
Miller and his company have been mak
ing an unusually fine impression upon
theater-goers. Xo such organization of
nu rit has sippeared here in some time.
There will be a matinee to-day.

PERRAULT DEFENDS
THE NEW TAX LEVY
Explains in Detail the Motive of
Many Appropriations.
If an Absolute Dollar Limit B2 Observed the School
Fund Most Suffer -Injustice of the Critics.
The Mayor's Brilliant Dreams.
THE tax levy recommendations
of the Finance Committee of
the Board of Supervisors have
created a great deal of discus
sion, but there is now practi
cally no question that they will be
adopted by the board at the proper
time. The Supervisors are firm In their
determination to keep their pledge and
they have with them the support of the
business community. As a matter of
course the public officials, whose reve
nues have been curtailed, are wild with
indignation and protest that they can
not conduct their departments with the
amounts provided for them. A morn
ing newspaper, which it is hoped will
wake up in a few days to the interest
ing fact that the Finance Committee
has adopted a tax levy, is giving ex
pression to the disconsolate among
whom it has the unhappiness to be
numbered.
An analysis of the levy, however,
throws a different light on the matter.
The estimates, as they have been
adopted by the Finance Committee, are
largely the work of Dr. Ed Perrault.
who discussed the levy yesterday and
demonstrated the justice of what he
believes to be the various appropria
tions.
"Surae comment has been made," said
Dr. Perrault. "because we did not make
a separate appropriation for the con
tingent expenses of the City and Coun
ty Attorney. We made no such provis
ion, as there is already an appropria
tion of J-ft.OOO for stationery and print
ing and another of $2000 for printing
transcripts on appeal. The City and
dunty Attorney may rest easy in the
assurance that his demands will al
, ways be honored.
"It Is charged that we have nearly
crippled the Board of Health. A few
comparisons will show that we have
done nothing of the kind. Previous to
the fiscal year of 1895-% the salaries
under the board aggregated only $21,
--000, divided among the following em
ployes: Health offlc< r, secretary, as
sistant secretary, messenger, market
inspector, three assistant market in
spectors, six health inspectors, plumb
i ing inspector and assistant plumbing
j inspector. At that time the regular al
lowance for expenses was $5000. In
j times of epidemics additional assist
ance was allowed and paid for out of
: the urgent necessity fund, according to
i statute. Since 1890 and before the ad
! vent of the last Hoard of Health, the
department was successfully conducted
upon this basis by such physicians as
I ns. Rosenstirn, A. W. Perry, McCar
thy, Clinton, VY. H. Mays, McQueston,
Le Tourneux and others, whose ability
is above question.
"Some adverse comment has been
created because of the abolition of the
Quarantine Department. This city
surely <;in trust to the integrity and
ability of the United States officials in
this matter, the Federal Government
has recently commanded its quarantine
officials to exercise exceptional vigi
lance, particularly at this port, and a
; local department of quarantine is alto
gether unnecessary.
"It is charged that we have not inter
fered with the revenues of the Sheriff,
the District Attorney, the License Col
lector and the Clerk of the Justices'
Court. That part of the criticism which
is not nonsense is malice. The Sheriff
is allowed what the statutes guarantee
to him and nothing more. The District
Attorney has been treated precisely in
the same way, with the exception that
he is given $50 a month for the first six
months for a stenographer. There is
provision for such an employe at $75 a
month under the charter.
"A comparison between the Justices'
Court Clerk and the County Clerk will
show whether or not the former is en
titled to what he receives. The Jus
| tices' Court Clerk has seven assistants.
Including a messenger. The aggregated
salaries of the office are $10,680 a year
and the income transferred by the office
to the city is $I>L',4lS1 > L',4lS 90. The County
ciork has seventy-nine assistants and
turns over to the city only $48,603 38, a
little more than double what the Jus
tices' Clerk contributes. The office of
the License Collector is one of the most
profitable to the city in the municipal
government. The License Collector has
plenty of employment for all his depu
ties, as I have no doubt the Mayor will
admit.
"In reference to the fire alarm and
police telegraph, a great hue and cry
has been raised. I'nfair critics insist
that the department will now go to
ruin and that for lack of the facilities
of communication whole sections of the
town may burn down. This assertion
can be raised to no greater dignity than
that of a malicious He. The efficiency
of the department will not be impaired
in the slightest degree. All improve
ments and extensions in it have nei â â¢â s
sarily been stopped because of our
pledge. The Superintendent has noth
ing to do except to keep the system over
which he has supervision In good re
pair. And for the purpose we have

! granted him $18,100, or more than $r>nn
; a month. I have little doubt that we
could give this work out by contract for
I that sum and be assured of splendid re
! SUItS.
"The shouting defenders of the Fire
Department are indignant because it
did not receive more. These worthy
! and noisy champions must not forget
! that the appropriation will be largely
increased by contributions from the in
surance companies. From this source
alone $29,635 was received last year.
"The fees of stenographers have been
increased $15,000, the last board having
allowed this amount for the whole year
against the allowance in the present
levy for six months. This has been
clone to avoid a deficiency in Decem
ber. Full provision has been made for
stenographers under the charter. The
assertion that we have provided for an
increase in the police force is untrue.
We have simply allowed sufficient to
pay the salaries of the force for the
first six months and the salaries for
the same force under the charter sched
ule.
"No change has been made in the
Treasurer's office, which receives pro
vision for its full complement of em
ployes for the first six months, and the
charter allowance for the second six
months. Any criticism in reference to
the appropriation for the Superintend
ent of Streets is silenced by the fact j
that we have no power to provide for
the second six months, as the charter
does not provide for a Superintendent
of Streets.
"It has bepn used as an argument I
that we have not kept our pledge to
the dollar limit. This is technically
true, but shall we repudiate our prom
ise of $125,000 for St. Mary's square and
deduct $130,000 from the school fund to
pay statutory salaries? If we do we
will bÂ«- within the pledge. The levy as
we have made makes provision for ab
solutely no permanent improvements.
All the brilliant suggestions of the
Mayor, made in his last annual mes
sage, have of necessity been ignored.
We have been concerned solely wtth the
current expenses of the government."

â¢â¢: : ; an : intensity. of interest which has never
. : ..before' ' been . aroused by a transconti
trlp;
. â â ']â . The journey from New York to San
F:;r.ciscn has been made many times
before under various condition? and
with the help of various assistant? to
prr.srrossion. The long stretch of 3700
miles has been covered by men on foot,
on horseback, in wheelbarrows and on
bicycles; but none of these trips meant
anything special to the world in gen
eral, and they only proved what we all
knew before â that men are capable of
enduring almost unbelievable discom-
fort, privation and fatigue for the sake
. of earning either a little money or a
: little notoriety, or both.
The undertaking of Mr. and Mrs.
Davis means, however, something ut
terly different. Outside of the enter
prise shown by the Call-Herald there is
a deep significance in it which appeals
to the whole civilized world. It means
a revolution in our entire system of
lornmotlon and burden-bearing â a
changing of Things as They. Are into
Things as They Ought to Be. ,
It means the passing of the horse,
save as an expensive luxury for those
who can afford to Y>f> whimsical; and
with him will pass tho n r >iso and con
fusion and crowd and most of the
debris of out city streets, and a reign
of comfort,, quiet and cleai.Jness will
ensue which will make us wonder, in
years to come, how we ever endured the
thousand thoroughfare miseries of the
present day.
Mr. Davjs and his wife are to travel
in an automobile 1 a horseless carriage
which has a cylinder instead of a horse,
a lever instead of r<-L . and three gears
instead of a whip. If they succeed, as
they without question will, in bringing
their' long ride to a triumphant con
clusion, the last argunv i;t against the
familiar uso of the automobile will have
been silenced.
Heretofore it has been considered
that, however well self-propelled ve
hicles might accomplish their various
purposes on smooth and level city
streets, or on the almost ideal high
ways of J^ngland and France, their
most enthusiastic advocates could look
for nothing but failure when the at
tempt should be made to utilize them
outside such limits.
â d on by th<-> necessity of the
case, the American inventor, has turned
his attention particularly to making
such improvements in this most popu
lar mechanical device as shall render
it available anywhere that an ordinary
horse and carriage could make their
way; and- the present highest result of
his inventive ingenuity and patient ex
periment is; a "rarer" which weighs
tess than 1000 pounds, can mount a 2")
per cent grade with ease and has a
guaranteed capacity of sixty-five mile.,
an hour: The Call-Herald automobile,
or. "touring; cart," in which our two ad
venturous traveler's are coming across
the plains and the deserts and the
mountains that lie between us and far
distant New York, has been built espe
cially for this journey. It is. however,
save that its various parts are fash
ioned more strongly than if it were to
be used "for mere pleasure jaunts along
smooth and comparatively level ways,
in no way different from the vehicles
desig-ned for BUcb purposes.
While electricity â easy of access. low
of cost and divested of its present al
most prohibitive weight and -consequent
clumsiness â is most certainly the mo
tive power of the%future for al! auto
matic vehicles, gasoline is the cheapest
and most convenient agent of the pres
ent.
The power principle of thp gasoline
motor depends upon the fact that gaso
line, mixed in certain proportion? with
atmospheric air, will explode if ignited.
An electric spark is the means in most
high-grade automobiles of producing
thr> succession of small explosions
which are necessary to keep the muter
in motion and the carriage rolling
along on its noiseless pneumatic tires,
with only a slight vibration, changing
scenery and the impact of displaced air
to prove to its occupants that they are
progressing instead of stationary.
There are those who have sat at
their ease in the travelers' cabs of New
York or ridden along the pleasant
roads in the vicinity of that city in
automobile carriages, who will scarce
ly appreciate the fact that Mrs. Davis
in taking this trip is proving herself to
be possessed of a personal courage al
most phenomenally above the aver
age.
True, she is journeying in company
with her husband, but the way leads
over rough and untried roads, through
frowning forests and stretches of cy
clone-haunted plains, over the furnace

steep cliffs and amid clouds of blind-
Ing dust in the alkali regions, which,
like the fabled Yellow Dwarf, stand
sentinel before the doors of our en
chanted gardens.
She has made up her mind to endure
all this and bravely. Heat and cold,
wind and sun, "torm and calm, all are
as nothing to her compared with the
charm of this epoch-making race
against time and the traditions of the
MRS. JOHN D. DAVIS OUTLINES HER WORK FOR THE SUNDAY COLL.
IAM ready for my journeyâ my long and perhaps perilous journey from ocean to ocean across the broad
bosom of our country of immense distances. The nearly 4000 miles over which I am to travel
stretch b?fore me a long vista of possibilities. The probabilities I know; the possibilities I guess;
but neither daunts me. With supreme confidence in the invisible steed which is to bear me swiftly over
roads and plains and mountain passes to my journey's end, and in the driver whose skilled hand and cool
judgment will be our safeguard in time of danger, I look forward to my trip with an enthusiastic im
patience which I cannot express.
To be the first woman to cross the continent in an automobile! That is in itself reward enough for
whatever of personal discomfort may fall to my lot on the way.
To be. the two of us, alone in the pathless silence of untrodden wilds; to. see the sun rise and set un
obscured by the lowering smoke of civilization; to pitch our tent in the mountain fastnesses and be face to
face with Nature in her wildest moods; and through it all to be going onward and ever onwardâ swiftly,
silently, surelyâ toward our haven in the city of the Golden Gate! This is the prospect that allures me
and beckons me irresistibly on.
True, there may be perils in the way, but they have no terrors for me. The glory of effort, the pride of
accomplishment is to be mine. The knowledge that I have done what no woman before me has even
dreamed of doing will always be a source of gratification; but better still will be the knowledge that I
have, through real difficulties andâ l am sureâ imagined dangers led in the way along which other wo
men may follow in peace and pleasantness.
The trip having been proven by us to be possible -in spite of the obstacles which we shall unavoid
ably meet, the chief of which will no doubt be the bad roads about which every one tries to discourage us,
may be an incentive to the building of a great national boulevard stretching its smooth length from
east to west, and binding them together in closer unity. Along such a road automobiles â distance-de
vouring products of human ingenuity â would speed with almost lightning swiftness, and the adventure
of to-day would be the excursion of to-morrow.

My camera and my writing pad are to be my close companions, and by means of th^m I shall make
records of what I see. feel and experience and ssnd them to The Sunday Call from trio different stations
on our triumphal progress.

attempted she is determined to accom

There is not a man or woman in the
country who will not wish her and her
husband well. They are working not
for themselves but for the progress of
the human race, and every revolution
of their noiseless wheels that brings
them nearer to their goal is a message
to higher civilization.

A COMPLETE
HISTORY OF
THE MODERN
AUTOMOBILE.
The modern history of the automo
bile In America reads like a fairy tale.
The already immense business of butld-
ing and operating horseless vehicles of
all kinds seems almost to have come in-
to being in a single night, like Aladdin's
magic palace.
Not quite a year ago the less than
thirty automatically propelled carriages
then owned in the United States were
viewed by the general public with
doubting curiosity rather than appro
bation. To-day an aggregate capital
of nearly 5400.000.000 is invested in this
still rapidly growing industry in New
York, Boston, Chicago and Philadelphia
alone. The eighty companies which are
engaged in manufacturing the 200 dif
ferent varieties of automobile convey
ances now in use find it impossible to
supply the daily increasing demand for
their product, and the general public
has become so thoroughly impressed^
with the merits of this innovation upon
established methods of locomotion that
it is confidently prophesied that the
horse _ the most abused and milst
nearly deified animal in the civilized
worldâ will be in five years' time com
pletely superseded and looked upon as
a luxury instead as a necessity. It is
true that this same idea was enter

tamed when bicycles came into general
use a taw years since, and it has proved
correct to a great degree, since eques
trianism and drives for pleasure have
never regained the popularity which
was theirs previous to the introduction
of the fascinating "safety."
The utilitarian range of the bicycle,
however, is not wide. Personal exertion
more or less severe is necessary to its
propulsion, and as. a burden bearer it
hap been a success only in a very limit
ed degree. Therefore the horse has
continued to defile our streets, deafen
our ears with the clatter of his hoofs
and fill space on our crowded thorough
fares.
The automobile, however, is destined
to revolutionize all this. Practical
demonstration has proved its worth,
and it is only a question of a very brief
time before it will be freed from the
few faults which now militate against
its absolute perfection.
While France and England have
been for the past ten years experiment
ing with and for the past five years
utilizing the automobile, they have not
produced a machine of this kind which
is comparable for lightness, strength

and speed with those now being export
e 1 by some American firms.
Once convinced of the practicability
and desirability of the idea American
invention proceeded to conquer the dif
ficulties presented. The ordinary Amer
ican road is very different from the
smooth and well-kept highways of Eu
ropean countries, and one of the prob
lems to be solved was to overcome the
automobile's aversion to grades and
persuade it to travel along paths not
specially prepared for its accommoda
tion.
The result of study and experiment is
that we have now a racing machine
weighing lofs than 1000 pound?, which
is guaranteed to make sixty-five miles
an hour on a Fmnoth road and maintain
a speed of thirty-five miles an hour on
any grade not exceeding 20 per cent.
In 1890 MM. Serpollet and Archdeacon
attempted an automo-bile â '.speed" jour
ney from Lyons to Paris, and con
sumed ten long days in the process.
While France has a special likine for
gasoline as a motive power and Eng
landâtoo fond of horses to readily ex
change them for mere machines â pre
fers steam, and so far applies the prin
ciple more to drayage and trucking
than to pleasure vehicles, America is
far ahPH'l in the electrical line.
The ideal machine is noiseless, odor-
less and free from vibration, but while
the electric auto-carriage is all this it
is immensely heavy, because of the use
of storage batteries, and can run <nly
a limited distance without recharging.
When electrical hydrants, such as
were exhibited at the Madison-square
Gardens recently, are placed at con
venient intervals along our streets and
roads the^e drawbacks will be done
away with and the electric vehicle will
undoubtedly distance all competitors in
the estimation of the public.
Of the Â«ix motor powers now in use â
electricity, gasoline, steam, compressed
air, carbonic acid gas and alcohol â only
the first three have so far been success
ful, and each of them has its disad
vantages. They are all necessarily ap
plied in a cumbersome way, and the
question of simplification and lighten
ing of weight is engrossing the atten
tion of inventors and manufacturers:
Superheated air, which was used suc
cessfully as a motive power in New
York in the early sixties, has not, so
far as known, been experimented with
in relation to this particular mechan
ism.
Compressed air has been applied to
heavy trucks, but the air when released
from pressure takes up heat so rapidly
that pipes and valves freeze solid and
a "re-heating" apparatus has to be
provided, which adds materially to the
general clumsiness of the outfit.
Gasoline exploded in an engine cyl
inder by means of an electric spark, the
engine being of what is known as the
four-cycle variety, gives very satisfac
tory results, and the gasoline automo
bile is extremely convenient for general
use. The objections to this power, how
ever, are that there is always a slight
vibration due to the constantly recur
ring explosions, and always a slight
odor of gas combustion, while the vehi
cle is never self-starting, the driver be-

ing.orliged to turn by hand the wheel
controlling the piston until the explo
s-iMn? begin.
The cost of running a gasoline motor
is astonishingly light, five gallons of
gasoline sufficing to carry a 77-pound
phaeton for 100 miles. Steam is also
cheap, and electricity, when the de
mand for it becomes as great as the
future promises, will be cheaper still.
Ohirago has signalized her belief in
the superiority of the Tatter power by
following New York's example and in
stituting an electric cab system, which
enthusiasts declare will prove a boon
to her citizens. Over a hundred electric
cabs are in daily use in New York, and
200 more areSilready ordered, so highly
is their cheap, comfortable and rapid
service appreciated.
In view qf these facts the Western
city feels no hesitation in embarking a
large amount of capital in the enter
prise, which is to be in full operation
within her borders this month.
The cost of maintaining storage bat
teries for a year varies now from $50
for light buggies to $300 for heavy om
nibuses, the whole cost of operation
being three-quarters of a cent to four
cents per mile.
Although automobilism is generally
looked upon as a new idea, it is in re
ality far older than our railways, and
did its best to supersede horses as long
ago as the middle of the eighteenth
century. Nicolas Joseph Cugnot built
and ran successfully a model of an au
tomobile in 1763, and six years later
made for the French Government a
three-wheeled gun-carriage In which
the boiler was kettle-shaped and the
rotary motion supplied by pawls on
the piston rods and ratchet wheels fixed
to the driving wheels. Murdock, in
1781, and William Symington, in 1786,
followâ the one with a steam tricycle
and the other with a road coach, and
various modifications of the idea ap
peared thereafter,
In 1801 a full-sized road coach was
built by an Englishman named Trevi
thick, and in Isls W. James and Sir
James Anderson built and ran a stage
coach carrying twenty people and ca
pable of going seven miles an hour with
a. full .load. In 1522 Sir Goldsworthy
Gurney had several steam stages run
ning from London and nine steam om
nibuses were placed in operation by
Mr. Hancock. A steam carriage made
by Messrs. Squire and Macerone in 1833
went fourteen miles an hour at a cost
of 7 cents a mile.
The opposition of the staging indus
try and the diverting of public interest
to the subject of railroads brought the .
development of the automobile to a
standstill, and it has remained for ua
of the present decade to revive and ap
preciate it.
The races which have taken place
and are projected have aroused wide
spread and keen interest. The inter
national contest planned for August
between Alexander Winton, who made
the trip from Cleveland to New Yorkâ a
distance of 707*4 milesâ last May in
forty-seven hours and thirty-four min
utes, and Monsieur Charron, the French
champion automobilist, will undoubted
ly tend to still further popularize these
already popular conveyances, and it
will probably be but a very short time
before every city and town of impor
tance in the United States will be using
them, both for pleasure and for traffic.Dynamite S chhooner in a Fearful Electrical Storm

by publishing a monthly magazine;
second, by reprinting old astrological

by taking all possible steps to convince

the plan, and they promised to give
al possible assistance." Sapharial, Aa

of the well known almanacs, promised
at once to contribute toward the mag

How Heart Disease
May Be Cured By
Gymnastics.
A' RE has been round for hÂ»Â»art
disease. No drugs are used in
this treatment. All that is re-
Ired of the patient is that he
shall take frequent baths, fol
lowed by certain exercises, as In
a gymnasium. Persons who
were walk have been cured by
this simple treatment. It is known as
the "resisted movement" cure, and it
ha.s made a town famous. Bad Nau
heim, which is situated about twenty
miies from Frankfort.- in Germany, is full
r>f heart disease patients, and it is the
Mecca toward which thousands of suffer
ers are getting ready to travel. This,
however. Is merely because these people
can aff'-r'l to go to headquarters, but it
is a fact that any one can learn the treat
ment and have it administered at home.
These facts are reasonably important,
for it Is -calculated that the majority of
persons, in the United States at least,
nave some form of heart disease. This is
due to the high pressure under which we
live. The result Is because the condition
has been suddenly thrust upon us-, rather
than because of the condition itself. For
centuries our ancestors jogged along
through life with what might â¢'â â  called a
measured. dignified tread, each nation
within itself. Then came the great com
mingling which was light about by the
settling and development oii^America. It
â red a race of men that evolved the rail
road, the telegraph, th< telephone, the
typewriter and all of the other quickening
inventions of the age. Speed became the
one great necessity. The lays of slow
journeys. long letter writing, etc., were
past. Men now began to rush into the cit
â¢ies on fast trains. They made fortunes in
stock exchanges by methods which de
pended for success on (the difference in
time between the Ea/t and the West.
They rushed out to quick lunches which
were swallowed in the" interval of so many
business deals, and they rushed home
again while they scanned successive edi
tions of newspapers which contained In
formation â â¢!' all the world, in most, cases
not one hour old. Their wives and chil
dren partook of this rush and bustle In
greater or lesser degree. And all this ir
spite of â¢;â¢ fa<-i thai their ancestors had
prepared' them for a condition directly op
posite to the existing one. To be sure
after several generations the race has
worked itself Into stepâ it may be said tc
have come up abreast of its environment,
but the effect physically has been the
generating of maladies which frequently
leave men dead In bed. in office, or in the
frenzied pursuit of amusement. The blamÂ«
for most of these fatalities has been- at
tributed to heart disease. i -
Dr. Thomas K. Satterthwaite of New
York, who is cut the staff of the Post
Graduate and the Orthopedic Hospitals,
has been to Bad Xauheim to study the
treatment, and is now practicing it' in
America. He was asked to describe It
and to talk about some of the curious as
pects of the t T'-at American malady. He
said: . â  â Â» ,â¢
"The heart, being the central pumping
station for all the rapidly moving cur
rents of the human body; is naturally
very susceptible of changes that may take
place in those currents. ft may vary
'greatly in bulk during the twenty-four
hours. Its beat may go down to fifty an<S
up to 300. If a man stands up or lies down
the difference in his position will cause
his. heart to vary ten beats a minute, or
6W an hour. When we think that each
one of these Jost or gained beats alters
.the speed of the blood through the veins,
we gÂ«?t some Idea of what slight changes
in this organ may mean to the body at
large, for the above change is what takes
place in a healthy man. In a diseased
man. the difference, becomes much greater. 1
It; is curious, also, that the heart some
times murmurs when its owner is lying
down In a way that cannot be detected
.when he is standing. These sounds vary
with age and with health. Vierordt stud
ied them. .He placed a number of flat
â¢pieces of guttapercha, shaped like poker
chips, on the chests of men. women and
children.- He piled these chips one above
the .other* just over the heart until they
formed a splid column. Then he placed
NEW YORK, June 28.â T0 write a
complete account of the voyage
of the Belgica to the Antarctic
would be the work of many
months. Much has been accom-
plished by the expedition, and
the importance of the work done can
not be realized until after the knowl
edge gained has been put in proper
â¢shape by the workers in the land of
snow and ice. This may not be com
pleted for a year or two, as some of
the professors have other work on hand
that will prevent them giving their at
tention to their work in the Antarctic
circle.
The most distinctive feature about
our expedition is the fact that we were
the first human beings to ever spend a
winter in the Antarctic circle. And a
most awful winter it was â cold, dis
mal and dreary. But that did not Inter
fere materially with scientific work. In
fact, we had to work in order to keep
up our spirits, for we were in danger
all the time. Our vessel was frozen
tight in the ice for nearly thirteen
months, and it was Just as impossible
to get away from her as it would have
been to fiy to the moon.
The Belgica expedition was sent out
by the Belgian Government. In some
unaccountable way people got the im
pression that we were going to make
a search for the South Pole. This is
wrong. All we went out for was to
make a scientific survey and to study
the fauna and flora of the Antarctic re
gion. This we accomplished. To sum
up our work we made a. complete set
magnetic observations extending
throughout ihÂ» whole year within the
Antarctic circle. We made the first pro
file of the bed of thÂ«- ocean south of
Cane Horn. We made a large collection
of the birds, animals and flowers of the
south polar regions; We found that
what has always been known as
Hughes Gulf is !<ot a gulf at all, but a
strait, and that its southern end is
a splendid archipelago. Some of the
islands are large and apparently in
habitnble.
The Belglca left P.intn Arenas on Do
er 14, 1897, and, proceeding by the
Cockburn and Beagle channels, called
ai thfi Argentine coaling station of La
pataia in Tierrn del Fuego, where, by
the kindness of the Argentine Govern
ment, the vessel tilled up with coal.
Th*> Bel pica anchored every night in
navigating them' Intricate waters, and
the scientific staff took every oppor
tunity of studying the fauna, flora and
geology of the land.
on January 1. 1898, the Belgica left
the port of Hushuaia near Lapataia
with the intention of gaining the "p^n
to the eastward, and staying f"i
the night at Haberton, where a re
ins ear to the top of the pile and listened,
ft" the sound of the heart could not be
heard through the pile, Vierordt removed
the chips from the top of the pile one by
one until it could be heard. In this wav
he got a comparison of the intensity of
the sounds. He confirmed the idea that
different parts of the heart make differ
ent sounds. There were two distinct
soundsâ one a low-pitched. vibrating
sound of about forty vibrations a sec. aid.
the other a sound in the bass clef of
between tflfl and 200 vibrations a second.
Thesi observations were invaluable tÂ»>
other investigators. They were enabled
to detect differences in hearts which be
fore that were not known to exist. The
treatment of heart disease by sound be
came an important matter in the medical
profession. However, physicians knew
more of the existence of the condition
than they did of a means of alleviating it.
'"Professor Schott of Bad Nauheim,
Germany, began some years ago to treat
heart disease, not as mosi physicians had
treated itâ that Is. with the fear that any
exertion might prove fatal -but with the
idea that as n physical organ the hp;>rt
was susceptible of the same changes as
would be any other physical organ if
surrounded by a like condition. Schott
and his brother were led to these con
clusions by an accident. Tt appears that
these men. while treating neurasthenics

blood to the nerve centers the voltrme of

time its rate >vac diminished. As this re

here we met our first disaster. Dark
ness set in before we reached the bay
where we intended to anchor, and the
Belgica ran on a submerged rock and
remained fast all night. We thought at
first that we would get off when the
tide rose, but were disappointed and
had to pump out our entire supply of
fresh water in order to lighten the ves-.
sr!. This necessitated a return to a
small supply station on Staten Island.
It was nearly two weeks before we were
able to leave this anchorage and make
for the South Shetlands.
Then we struck heavy weather and
lost our first man. Fogs came down
so thick that we could not see the
length of the vessel, and during one of
th'- bad spells the wind rose to a gale.
While the storm was at its height one
of the sailors, named Welneke, from
iania. was lost overboard. In a
moment he wa.<- out of our sight, but
we lowered a boat and made a long
search for him at the risk of our lives.
Our boat partially filled witn water and
the "old was intense After an hoc.* we
were compelled to go aboard the Bel

grees and 20 minutes south we were
almost In the depths of winter. A prale
was blowing and great rifts formed in
the edge of the ice pack. Huge blocks
we're thrown around like so many chips.
Our vessel -ground and crunched among
this mass, and It seemed as if the craft
must be crushed to pieces. We kept
on and when the weather moderated
pushed still farther to the south. We
all knew the risk of getting caught in
the ice, as the season was advancing:

over-ice journey, but this proved im
possible on account of the condition of
the ice. To the southward of us
stretched an ice field as far ns the eye
could reach. There were no very large
bergs, but one vast plain of frozen
â water.
It was rhen realized that we could k^
no farther to tho smith, so we deter
mined to return. This proved impos
sible, as ice was forming all around us.
In the following week we made seven
miles, although the vessel was kept up
to her full steaming capacity day and
night. Dn March 10 we were finally
blocked and made preparations for the
winter. The ship was banked up with
snow, but once or twice th" pn-'k

best practitioners In Europe.
"Professor George Oliver of England
had shown that a healthy arm. aftt-r being
exercised, displaced more water in a ves
sel than it <lid !'<-f<ir<- it was exercised.
This was attributed to the fact that the
hlo-iil thickened during exercise. Pro
fessor Schoti at Nauheim knew that
walking smartly across a room would
often diminish the rapidity and Increase
the force. f< ir the time bedng, of a weakly
acting heart. He decided to treat thf
â  for its development as fie would
any other muscular organ of the body* He
proceeded to treat it from tho standpoint
of the relation of exercise to growth. All
bodily organs which are exercised grow:
any organ which is not exercised ceases
its development. Professor Schott de
termined to exercise tin- heart.
"The treatment involved first a series
of preparatory baths in the waters of the
natural springs which exist in Xauheim.
The stimulating effect of these waters
prepares the sufferer for the exorcise
which follows. The exercise Involves
every muscle in the body. No apparatus
is used. The patient is told to make cer
tain motions which bring; certain muscles
into play, but when he tries to do it an
attendant catches him by the arm, or the
leg:, whichever part is to be moved, and
tries to stop the movement. The patient
must do it in spite of the attendant, the
'resistance' causing him more exertion
than if he were left unobstructed. In
consequence the houses of Nanheim seem
at times to be full of men and women
wrestling with one another. One man will
be seen swinging his hands over his head
like a human windmill, while an attend
ant stands beside, him on a chair, holding
his wrists and trying to stop him. An
other man will be found standing oti one
leg- and moving the other violently, while
an attendant holds on grimly to his ankle
and will not be shaken off. Still another,
standing with his bark to the wall, seems
bent on falling Hat on his face in spite of
the attendant, who persistently props htm
up as he comes forward. Others around
about seem to be indulging in sparring
matches, the attendants In every case re
sisting the movements of their charges.
All of these people are under treatment
for heart disease.
"In other parts of the place men.
women and children are being 'bathed,
some of them in brine, others in water
which is hardly brackish. The newcomer
is given a simple bath in the water of the
sprin&s, which has been freed from car*
break up. Then the cold became in
tense, and all hope left us. We were
frozen as solid as a rock of granite.
At this time some remarkable
weather changes were noticed. The
temperature depended entirely on .the
direction of the wind. When it came
from the south, the weather was clear
and cold; when from the northâ i. c.,
from the open sea, it was almost al
ways cloudy, often foggy, and the tem
perature kept near the freezing point,
sometimes even causing a thaw. The
drift of the ship was also a direct func
tion of the wind. During the drift the
latitude of 71 decrees 34 minutes south
was reached in 89 degrees 10 minutes
west on May 16, and 71 degrees 36 min
utes west <>n May 30.
The appearance of the pack changed
constantly with the movements to
which it was subject- Generally it was
very compact, but great openings
sometimes appeared. clear spaces,
channels or mere threads of water.
The cracks the formation of which
gave rise to these lanes of water often
extended beyond the reach of vision to
the north or south, the east or west,
and they were often formed quite near
the ship, which, gripped in its icy vise,
was unable to reach them.
Occasionally there would be awful
convulsions that made the ship tremble
from stem to stern. The openings in
the ice ftekl had a way of closing up
as the result. of some outside pressure.
Th<=> .two edges would come together
and then gradually rise to a height of
several feet. A row of hummocks
marked the spot where the crack had
been. When the intense cold weather
came we had hopes that H would be
clear and calm, but in this were dis
appointed. High winds prevailed, no
matter how low the thermometer fell,
so that it waa almost certain death to
venture any .great distance from thr
shlp. V/ork was impossible. Snow f--l!
in blinding storms. Travel across the
ice wag. impossible, as the pack had a
way of moving and cracking and leav
ing openings that it would be impossi
ble to cross should <>ne come between
us and the ship.
Gradually the days got shorter and
shorter, dreary and more dreary. On
May 17 the sun set after a day of only
a few minutes' duration, and we did not
see it again for nearly ten weeks. Then
began our struggle with ourselves.
There was nothing \\. j could do for days
and days and the awful darkness bore
down like a heavy weight.
This was a critical period for all of
the ship's company, but all survived
except Lieutenant banco. He fell sick
at about the beginning of the dark days
and gradually grew worse in spite of
all that could be done for him. I spent
days at his bedside and was careful
that he should not realize the serious
ness of his case. Everjj man on board
did nl! in his power to save the brave
fellow, but all to no purpose. He passed
away on June j> at 7 p. m.. but there
waa nothing to distinguish the time of
day, as it was as dark as pitch.
bonic acid and diluted with fresh warm
water. After a few days the fresh warm
water is left 'nil and he gets the spring
water at normal temperature, but with
most of the carbonic acid extracted. Next
he is put into a bathtub which is charged
with the salts and carbonic acid just as it
'merges from the earth. The fourth ami

for a bath like the one just mentioned,
except that the water is allowed to run in
and out of the tub constantly. Nnno but.
â¢! quite vigorous person can take this
form of bath without ill effect. These
baths are really the lirst stage of the
exercise treatment, and they ar<-> given
to diminish the frequency and to increase
the force of the pulse beat.
"\\"hen the patient comes for treatment
it Is usually found that his heart is
clogged ;ii]il dilated with blood. The first
thins to do then, naturally, is draw this
blood as far away from the central organ
as possible. The heated bath is the l.< -
ginning of the process of withdrawal.
The capillaries of the skin are relieved
of their natural store of blood and some
of the oversupply in the heart rushes out
to supply the loss. In the Becond stage
of the bathing the carbonic j?as numbs tin
skin, practically it paralyzes the capil
laries and increases the rush of blood
from the heart. In the third form of bath
the chloride of calcium sets up an irrita
tion which makes the body appear as if
covered with nettle rash. It Is the ad
vanced stage of the process hy which the
heart is relieved of overwork. It prepares
the patient for the exercise that follows.
"Hundreds have been benefited by the
Nauheim treatment, but there are famous
cases which stand out prominently from
the rest. These cases naturally are the
constant subject of talk b/ the newcom
ers who go down to the baths. There was
the broken-down Englishman, 50 years
old. who was carried into Nauheim. help
less from heart disease, gout, dyspepsia
and enlarged liver. He could not walk
a step. They cut down his food supply
at once, allowing him about half of what
he really wanted to eat. They bathed him
in diluted water at first, gradually In
creasing the strength of the solution. At
the end of a week he could walk a little,
and he began to take a constitutional of
five yards a day. Then they exercised
him lightly, increasing the resistance and
the work as the days went on. His dally
routine was about as follows: He arose
at 8; breakfasted on soft boiled eggs,
weak coffee and Zwiback at S:30; bathed
at 9:30; slept at 10 for an hour: exercised
r
Then followed one of the most dis
mal days that I have any recollection
>t. Every man on the vessel was pros
;rated, and it was all that the officers
Could cÂ«o to keep some of them from
falling into fits of melancholy. One or
two poor fellows took to their beds and
gave vent to their grief by violent sob
bing. They seemed to think that they
would never see their homes nor friends
again. A death on board a vessel un
der such circumstances and at such a
time is one of the most heart-rending
events in the world.
The worst of all was the burial of
poor Danco. The only way to dispose
of the remains was to cut a hole
through the ice and drop him through.
It seemed a ghastly thing to do, but
we had. to reconcile ourselves to it.
The day of the funeral was dismal in
the extreme. Even the customary
twilight was dimmer than usual/and a
slight fall of snow was blowing
through the air. The cold was in
tense.
Digging the grave was a woeful task
and consumed several hours, as the
ice was at least seven feet thick. The
burial ceremony was made as impres
sive as possible. The body was car
ried from the ship to the grave on a
board Just as If it was to be dropped
into the sea. It was weighted with a
cannon shot, and at the sacred words
read by Captain de Gerlack we let
poor Danco slide into his icy grave.
There was no splash as the body left
us. only a little gurgle that cut the
heart of every man there and caused
many a brave fellow to weep. That
day is In my memory as the saddest
of my life.
Taken as a general thing the health
of th^ men on board the stflp was good.
There was a complete absence of the
ailments usual on such a cruise and
with the exception of a slight touch of
nostalgia and some cardiac- affec
tions during the latter part of the dark
Season everybody was in perfect
health.
Toward the end of the winter, when
the sun began to peep out for a few
minutes each day, we secured several
seals ami penguins, which bit of fresh
meat greatly added to our regular diet.
When the polar night was past all be
gan to feel in better spirits and to hope
for an opportunity to get out of our icy
prison, of course none of us had the
least idea that we would have to stay
there during the summer, but we did.
During October the ice began to
crack and cannls appeared all through
the field, but none of them came any
where near our ship.
All through the summer months we
watched the ice thawing all around us,
but still keeping solid near our ship.
The nearest water to the vessel was
about 500 feet. When January came,
and there seemed no prospect of getting
out of our prison again, we decided' that
some desperate remedy must be re
sorted to. ' â  '.[',: 'â 
We looked at the clear water 500 feet
at 11: rested from 12 until 1. when ho
dined: rested an hour; went to walk at 3:
returned find rested until H. when he
dined; retired at '.Â» p. m. He was allowed
Inn one cigar a day. in deference to his
']â  mands, although no tobacco should be
allowed in any form, and only the sour
wines. At the end of four months he
could walk five miles a day. and he was
discharged apparently without an ailment.
"This treatment is not. as many might
think, allied to the Swedish movement
cure. The latter is violent, while the Nau
heim treatment is a slow process, both in
practice and in development. In fooling
with such a dangerous malady as heart
disease one has to be careful, or there
might be a collapse. For this reason I
should not advise any one to undertake
ihe treatment except under the care of a
skilled operatorâ preferably one who had
personally 'studied the German method. If
gymnasium instructors were to take it up,
for Instance, I am afraid they could not
be thoroughly impressed with the abso
lute necessity of going slow. Every move
ment should be made as slowly as possi
ble, and the rests between each movement
are quite as important as the movement
itself. On The other iiand. I believe the
cure can be carried on with even better
effect in America than in Germany. Schott
hns no exclusive right to the baths. They
are public affairs under the control of the
Government, and there are twenty doctors
In Nauheim giving the treatment. The
baths, too, ar<> open only during the sum
niec months. In America our excellent
plumbing arrangements are well adapted
to the purpose. In N'auheim the patients
have to go in the day time and stand
around in the open waiting to cool off.
Here we give the baths at bedtime with
much greater effect- The difficulty of pro-
curing a substitute for the Nauhelm salts
will have to be bridged by the family phy
sician. I believe the crystallized products
of the bath can be imported, but the in
gredients can be produced chemically. If
you can obtain sea salt, chloride of cal
cium, bicarbonate of soda, muriatic acid
and a bath tub- you will have all of the
essentials of a Nauheim bath, but I should
not care to put these chemicals into the
hands of the inexperienced layman. He
might do damage to himself and the tub.
Better go to a chemist and have him mix
you up the necessary ingredients. Almost
any doctor should be able to give the pre
scription. The bath should. be only slight
ly .-aline at first, gradually increasing In

attempt the strong- solution at first or it
might have bad effects.
from our ship and the solid ice between,
and the only way to reach the water
was to cut a canal through the ice.
Measurements with a borer showed
that the ice was about seven feet thick.
With the two longitudinal lines and the
many cross lines we figured that there
would be about 4000 feet of sawing
through the iceâ a herculean task, but
we had to do it. ,
i â  We - accomplished iit in about four
weeks. Then we blew up the loose
pieces with tonite and made ready to
take our leave. 7
Just at this time a swe,ll struck the
pack and narrowed the channel so that
the vessel would not move.- Disap
pointment made us all sick, but * the
swell kept up its work, and alternately
kept opening and closing the canal. By
the middle, of February the vessel was
loose from the solid ice and we were
able to give the propeller a few turns.
Steam was kept up day and night.
Once we were out of the pack and ac
tually started north when we were
blocked again and had to . remain: in
bondage for four weeks.
...On March 14 we felt the vessel
shiver from stem to stern and toss
about in the icefield. All-around us the
great blocks rose and fell, and our
craft was bumped and pinched, but by
constant work with the propeller we
really moved, and in a short time the
icepack gave way and we slipped out
into the open sea.
On the 16th, at 4 p. m., we recog
nized Black Island, and at 6 p. m. an
chored in its lee to shelter from a
strong west wind. From the edge of
the pack to Tierra del Fuego we had
not encountered a single piece of ice,
a fact which is at least worth mention
ing. During the night of the 26th there
were heavy squalls, and at 5 a. m. on
the 27th the wind blew a gale from
east-southeast, and the anchor began
to drag, and we had to. cut the cable
and stand out to sea to- save the vessel
from driving on the rocks. At 9 a. m..
while the gale was still raging, we en
tered Cockburn channel and reached
the anchorage of Punta Arenas next
morning at daybreak, fourteen days
after leaving the pack.
One of the principal lessons of the
cruise of the Belgica is the demonstra
tion of the fact that wintering in the
Arctic and wintering in the Antarctic
are two entirely different propositions.
If the south pole is ever reached it will
not be by dog sleds nor any over
land travel. There will either have to
bean open channel or some aerial plan
of navigation will have to be
adopted. Winter in the Antarctic, if
last winter is any criterion, is subject
to thaws when the ice should be solid.
The ripping of the channels in the ice
pack is an insurmountable difficulty.
More animal and vegetable life are :to
be found there than at the same par
allel on the northern end of the globe.
The north and the south poles are two
different problems and will have to be
studied out on two different lines.
FREDERICK A. COOK,
/
Lite and Work of a
Fabulously Rich
Clergyman.
AT 70 the Rev. Eugene Augustus
Hoffmann. D. D.. multi-millionaire
and richest clergyman in Amer
ica, if not in the world, is a busy,
shrewd, clever man. As dean of
the Union Theological Seminary
in New York, he is at the head of the
chief divinity school of the Protestant
Episcopal church, and in the twenty
years he has filled this post he has exer
cised a tremendous formative influence
upon the Episcopal clergy of the
country, a very large proportion of whom
have been trained under his eye.
Attired in non-distinctive dress. Dean
Hoffmann's appearance would suggest al
most any station in !if<' save that of the
ological teacher. Perhaps he would more
closely resemble an opulent, self-made
banker than any other type, one, how
ever, who was born with gentlemanly in
etlncts, and who by dint of keeping his
tyes constantly about him has developed
into an alert and courteous man of the
world, albeit there is much hluff hearti
ness in his courtesy. His figure is tall
and rotund, his strong features are deeply
seamed and his hair and full beard art
grizzled. His voice is by no means un
pleasant, but by no means melodious; it
suggests the voice of a veteran admiral
who has sailed over many seas and fought
many a desperate fierht.
Dean Hoffmann is sixth in descent from
Martinus Hoffmann, who came to America.
in 1640, and son of the late Samuel Ver
planck Hoffmann. The family has been
a factor in the social, commercial and
political life of New fork City for two
and a half centuries. The dean was born
just east of Broadway, in White street,
when that now downtown thoroughfare
was an aristocratic residence center.
After courses of study at Columbia. Rut
gers and Harvard, he sighed for adven
ture, and was allowed to join an expe
dition formed by Professor Agassiz to *â :<
--Â§lore the region north of Lake Superior,
ome months of rough experiences on that
expedition were quite enough for a life
time, and he returned to civilization and
studied theology at the seminary of which
he is now the head, and in 1851. when
only 22, began the life of a clergyman,
only to lay it down for the broader work
in which he is still active.
Conservative capitalists estimate the
present value of the Hoffmann estate at
from $15,000,000 to $20,000,000, but no one,
not even the dean himself, can appraise
It with certain accuracy. It was founded
before the republic was born, and under
the never-faulty Hoffmann management
has been growing year by year and dec
ade by decade, almost without intermis
sion, ever since. It now takes in row on
row of downtown structures and biocis
after block uptown. The Hoffmann House,
itself worth more than a million, with its
world-famed bar, is part of the property,
which was divided by inheritance a Tew
years ago between the dean and his
brother, also an Episcopal clergyman, by
far the larger share falling to the dean".
Dean Hoffmann has been very lavish of
his wealth in the- seminary's behalf.
Since he assumed its headship the two or
three almost shabby gray buildings at
Twentieth street and Ninth avenue, in
which the institution was then hor.se i.
have been increased to a noble cluster of
structures surrounding a beautiful quad
rangle, and the school itself has advanct-1
to the very first place. Throughout hi.s
service to date his salary has been al
lowed to accumulate, and in time will t<?
added to the endowment fund. Just how
large his various benefactions have been
no one knows but himself, and he won't
tell. From sources that should be re
liable, the writer is informed that ih3
total is certainly more thama million. His
gifts to the seminary include the beauti
ful deanery, and have been supplemented
by the Chapel of the Good Shepherd,
erected by his mother In memory of her
husband.
From the beginning of his career to
the present time, D< j an Hoffmann, rich,
cultured, courted by society, has been
a friend of the workingman. He has
no sympathy with the gradual deser
tion by the churches of those city re
gions which are crowded with indus
trial population. He believes the entuo
"downtown church" problem compara
tively simple and easy of solution along
lines long since found out In Philadel
phia, where he established the first work
mgmen's club ever organized in America.
That was just three decades ago, in 186;*,
the first year of his service as rector of
fit. Mark's, one of the most fashionable
churches in the Â»'ity of Brotherly Love.
Socially considered, the. roll of 400 com
municants was irreproachable. The con
gregation included many of the most
prominent personages in the town. Most
rectors would have thought such an as
semblage as Dr. Hoffmann officiated be
fcre.every Sunday an ideal one. But from
his viewpoint there was something
lacking. â  Few or no working persons
were ever to be seen in the pews of St.
Marks, despite the fact that the neigh
borhood supported a large industrial
population.
The founding of the St. Mark's Work
ir.gmen's Club was Dr. Hoffmann's first
move toward interesting the toilers in St.
Mark's Church.
"We got the workingmen's club notion
from printed descriptions of English?
workingmen's clubs." said Dean Hoffmann
to the writer recently, "but. conditions hi
Philadelphia being not exactly like those
obtaining in England, we had to work out
a plan of our own. The tirst thing we did
was to take quarters over a market place.
Our 'conversation' room was fitted up
comfortably with chairs and tables and
supplied with current reading matter, the
daily papers and such class periodicals as
we thought would interest the! men spe
cially predominating. In one -room games
were allowed. There were rooms where
the men could smoke and others wher,e
they could not. In the t*n year? 1 was
with St. Mark's there was not one un
pleasant incident in the club, and its hold
upon its members increased steadily. It is
still prosperous."
Dr. Hoffmann remained rector of St.
Mark's till 1579. In his ten years' service
he had become personally acquainted with
some member of each of the nearly 1000
families in the parish. His acquaintance
with his parishioners was by do mea^is
perfunctoryâ ho knew them as a friend
who always visited them when they m ed
ed him, even when they were Buffering
from contagious diseases. From Brook
lyn, from Elizabeth and Burlington. N. J..
and from Philadelphia come stories of
visitations that were marie by him in
times of pestilence. His theory seems to
have been that the clergyman is needed
quite as much as the doctor when 'death
is near, and he never hesitated to visit a
sick parishioner, even wiien the disease
was SnrallpoX or yellow fever. During the
prevail nee or" a smallpox epidemic In one
of his New Jersey parishes he visited the
patients so regularly that the Mayor of.
the city threatened to lock him up unless
he would promise to. stop the practice, for
fear the disease would be spread- by his
comings and goings.
He was not stopped either there or in
Brooklyn, where he went freely among
patients afflicted with yellow fever. Dr.
Hoffmann's house to house visita
tions were such a noteworthy fea
ture of his work as long as
he served the churches that hi? parish
ioners felt free to call upon him in every
sort of emergency. Thus at Elizabeth a
little girl rushed into his study one day,
crying:
"Mother hopes you'll come to the house
right away. sir. " Father says he's going
to kill her."
The doctor left the sermon he was pre
paring and followed the child. At the
house he found the father crazy drunk.
As the young clergyman enteredâ this
was all of forty years agoâ the fellow
raised a chair high in the air as if to
brain the intruder.
"I'm not afraid of you nor no other
man." yelled the drunken man. "and.
you'd better clear out."
"I don't want you to be afraid of me,"
replied the clergyman, "but there's one
chap you'd better be afraid of. His name
is James Anderson. He lives here, and
when drunk he's dangerous."
The chair dropped to the floor at this
unexpected speech, and James Ander
son, already half sobered, begged pardon
for his brutality and promised to keep tho
â Peace. Then the rector wont placidly
back to his sermon-writing. %

. A number cf sharp skirmishes en
sued; the Zulu Kins was captured; his
military system abolished, his territory
divided" into districts and his mines
made amenable to the crown of Eng
land. Then concessions followed, the
King was set free, pensioned and al
lowed to rule as potentate over the
chiefs of his tribe.
And this was not all.
It was the last clause of the treaty
that affected the Zulu nation more than
all e!s* combined â the clause that guar
anteed education to the King's heirs â
and It will eventually be the keynote
to free them from savagery.
Consequently the ten roya! Princesses
and the Crown Prince of the house of
Okokudek were sent to Cambridge Uni
versity. It !s considered something
even for an ambitious mother to grad
uate one 'varsity daughter, but it Is
given to few Queens to graduate ten
Princesses of blood royal into the pro
fession of new women.
Two of these ten daughters are prac
ticing physicians in London. Four of
them are gold miners in South Arrlca.
Two are expert mathematicians, and
â 
ten daughters of the King left Cam
bridge University to fight their battles
with the civilized world, and one of the
royal family remained within the old
college walls, and that one was Pr : Â»
Jerger.
He remained to complete the univer
sity course, but destiny silently pre
pared for him another. The Prince
loved the study of mathematics as he
loved his own loyal, uncivilized people;
but within a year of graduation he dis
covered another love. And this was his
love for a woman. It was the steady
growth of an affection that began upon
the very --â¢ day of his entrance to
the university.
Although the <--ivi!ized world as a
wonderland to him and inspired the
keenest interest, still he pined for his
home and half-savage comrades with
a longing only understood by those
whose lives are cast among a foreign
people. The Saxon language was hard
to master, Saxon manners were diffi
cult and insincere, and the alien Prince
felt the wretchedness that never had
been his even when his father's king
dona passed under British rule.
That night Prince Jerger wandered
into the colleee grounds .with heart
bowed down. The strange religion of
the north did not appeal to him. Civ
ilization oppressed him: he would seek
consolation from the only God that his
people could understand". And bo un
der the darkening shadows of the tree?
he prostrated himself upon the earth
and offere up his prayer^ The Christ

Prince Jerger was so absorbed in his
devotions that he did not hear a soft

" 'All are well but your wifs; she is

"On the fallowing day I was informed

only one feature that reminded me of
the last battle that I fought in with

do with "weakening Spanish nerve, for
the enemy thought that we were ail
alive while their men were dropping

contrast between civilized and savage
warfare.

had little time to sleep, however, for soon

for hours, driving- them away from their
horses and forcing them to "take to the
rocks. The task was costly, however for
while dosing in on them the head of the
Sheriff Joseph Hazen of Convers*
County, was killed by a bullet.
Crippled by their losses, the posse conld
not guard the outlaw^, and that nigh
they crept away, stole horses from a
ranch near by and rode off northeast
across the hills, toward the "Hole In the

the entrance, was met' by them two days
later, and he told them the possÂ» had cut
in ahead of them and that the ranch and
the "Hoie" were guarded.
They dared not enter their old retreat
but friends gave them horses ar.d food*
Then, making a wide detour, they went
flown the Powder River and struck of!
across a trail that led arcund the great
cliff wall.
They found time, for rest and recupera
tion on the solitary E. K. Mountain
which raises its raeged sides above the
"Hole in the Wall" Valley. Bloodhounds
trailed them there and scores of men sur
rounded them, penning them in caiivors
time after time. *
The new? of the killing of Sheriff Haien
had spread throughout the State. The
Governor had offered tSOOt reward for
each of them, and the railway and express
companies had proffered an equal amount.
Troopers had been sent from Fort Me-
Kinley to the north; picked militiamen
had been equipped as cowboys and the
United States Marshal and the Sheriffs
had gathered the crack shots and fearle*Â«s
characters of the whole region to aid in
the chase.
From rock to rock and gully to gmlly
they fought against great odds for a
â week, the pursuers constantly closing In â 
avoiding a charge in their desire to take
the men alive. Then one morning the =
posse closed in on the retreat from which
they had fought the night before, only to
find that the desperate little band "had
escaped again.
Bloodhounds took up the trail, again
crossing west through the "Hole-ln-tha
"Wall" valley and the Big Horn Moun
tains, then southwest toward the Sho
shone Indian reservation, and finally into
the heart of the Owl Creek Mountain-?
where they again took a stand. Persons
who had met them in their nigh: said â¢
they had five fine horses, two carrvine
supplies and ammunition. They *tole
fresh animals from the Indian reserva
tion i:: their flight, but no animal could
stand such a chase against the fresh re-:
lays of the Trained men behind.
"In the Owl Creek Mountains it was
three against four hundredâ desperation
matched against skill and a fortune for
the man who might pot them. With,
bloodhounds and Indian trailers about
them, and keen eyes watching for any
movement they could do little else than
try to sell life dearly, according to the
laws of men of their stripe.
â¢ The three men are worthy of their call
ing. .Cherokee blood runs in the veins- of
the Roberts brothers, and the mixture has
made them hate white men. Carrie was
formerly a cowboy, but turned cattle
thief four years ago. and he" and the Rob
erts brothers by their fierceness and dar
ing became leaders of the "Hole-fn-the-
Wall band. . â¢
The end of this trio, however, does not
mean the end of the band; There are still
fearless desperadoes to be hunted' out of
the "Hole." "Butch" Cassidy, known from
Canada to Mexico and "blood enemy" of
Colonel Jay L. Torrey of the Second
Rough Riders, will be their leader." â¢ â¢ .-

King George Is a young man of about
24 years of age. He was educated in
Xew Zealand and graduated from the
Wellington University when 18 years
old. He returned to Tonga with his
tutor, the Rev. H. S. Baker. Dur
ing the last of the Prince's minority,
ami a few month? before he succeeded
to his grandfather's throne, Baker be
trayed tho trust rep-xsed in him. Select
ing a time when the royal treasury was
full, the reverend guardian looted the
coffers of the kingdom and got away
with his booty on one of the steamers
running between the islands and
Australia
(Jporge ascended the throne soon af
terward, and by following the counsels
of his ministers was able to so admin
ister his affairs that the royal coffers
soon began to jingle with gold and sil
ver coin, and when, a few months ago.
he decided to marry, he was a particu
larly prosperous young potentate. He
had built himself a handsome palace,
erected a church for his people, com
pleted many of the improvements com
menced by his grandfather, had the
royal warehouses well stocked with
both native products and manufactured
importations, and had enough money in
the treasury to run his kingdom and
Justify. taking up the yoke of wedlock.
The most important person in Tonga,
next to his majesty, was Crown
Treasurer. KaanaK Kaapai was a
shrewd financier, and had the entire
confidence of his master.

age when he was abe to shoulder the

After considerable, discussion and
much traveling around among thf> isl
ands, the ministers .of the young king
picked out tw<> dusky belles.. One of
them was a pretty peasant girl from

Kubu, the 12-year-old daughter of
the Tonga minister of police. The two
maidens were submitted to George, who
showed his appreciation of his advisers'
good .taste by choosing them both.
Now Tonga is wonderfully far ad
motive power, the direct use of steam
in a. perfected locomotive system would
it Dot only cheaper to operate, but
also g-lve each motor car the independ
operty of moving, stopping and re
: versing at will.
: An<l after nine years of work Mr.
hns, according to many experts,
iCÂ«d a noiseless high power locomo
tive that could tnke a trnin of cars to
Chicago, on regular schedule time, with
out as much as losing, a single puff of
smoke or steam on the way, and without
a cinder to betray.lts course. The Dodge
motor is adaptable to all forms of au
ic contrivances; to carriages as
well as to launches. It is even feasible,
so saya the inventor, Â»to construct mo
tors of sufficient capacity to move- an
ocean-going steamship .".t the same rate
of Bpeed now attained, while attended
by a larger factor of safety and economy
of operation than that present in the or
â  riinarv steamship engine.
Believing ' that the steam locomotive
mechanism is unqualifiedly the best, the
simplest and the most durable method in
all respects ti V applying power to turn
a car wheel. Mr. Podge re-rained the link
motion feature of the ordinary locomo
tive and ad.apt.cd it to carry the equally
simple and direct condenser system of hl3
invention.
Instead of charging with cold water as
in the locomotive, he charged the boiler
or Storage reservoir placed transversely
under ' the car body -with superheated
water at a temperature of 400 degrees. In
other words, he started with the motor
boiler reservoir stored with the same
quality and power of available energy
that the locomotive can get only through
forced draft and rapid, imperfect com
bustion of fuel, necessitating the carry
ing of a tender and a tremendous tire un
der the boiler.
THE SA^s FRAXCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JULY 2, 1899.
vanced in civilization, and many of the
traditions of the outside world hold
good in Tonga society. Polygamy is as
little tolerated there as in New York
city, and when thn youthful ruler of
fered to set aside the old civilized state
of affairs and take a couple of wives,
Tonga society was shocked. The King
.of Tonga, like other Kings, can do no
wrong, and if his majesty had Insisted,
there was ii" power in the Friendly
Islands to prevent.
Preparations for the wedding ad
vanced auspiciously. The people of
the islands were notified, and from
every direction they poured into Tonga
laden with presents for their ruler and
his brides. The royal palace was ren
ovated from cellar to garret and
everything was in readiness for the
ceremony, when the alarming discovery
was made that for the second time
within a few years a faithless steward
had cleaned out the royal coffers and
fled.
King George, like all Tongans, Is an
enthusiastic yachtsman. Every native
of this group of islands is a natural
born sailor, and George, being King,
and possessed of more money than any
of his subjects, had purchased a mag
nifkent yacht. This yacht lay in the
harbor when his Majesty was not using
it. In this yacht Kaapai sailed away
with the royal gold.
The morning before the wedding
George walked out on the veranda of
his palace, took a look over the harbor
and noticed, to his surprise, that the
royal yacht was not at her moorings.
Mr. Dodge found by experiments that
only a very small fire was necessary to
keep' superheated watr-r at a continuous
temperature of 400 degrees, and to thfs
end he placed a small firebox within the
boiler under the car body. This firebox
is so small that it would hardly be no.

ance for assisting the boiler in maintain
ing' the temperature of tlie water It con
tains. This water Is now converted Into
steam In the ordinary locomotive man
ner, it passes the cylinders as steam, and
instead of escaping through a smokestack
with puffing and noise, causing a loss of
some twnty-odd per cent, it Is retained
in Mr. Dodge's system in an atmospherio
condenser, which is stored away practi
cally invisible on the roof of the car.
Through the successful operation of this
condenser, which undoubtedly It the
crowning result of Mr. Dodge's inven
tions, the old-fashioned forced draft and
wasteful form of generating power in
transit is entirely done away with, and
likewise the attendant nuisances, such as
nmoke, stea.m. sparks and cinders. The
motor must be recharged every hundred
miles.
Having achieved this feat, Mr. Dodge
very properly named his invention the
kinetic stored steam motor ("kinetic"
meaning "force and motion"), and it was
placed on trial in Chicago, running on the
West Madison Street Cable Company's
line, and there demonstrated in efficient
service on schedule time runs the practi
cability of Mr. Dodge's theory.
It is not only in operation that this sys
tem is cheaper and better than the other
known traction agents, but also in the
cost of equipment per car mile, which the

Calling an attendant he bade him make
inquiry regarding the pleasure craft.
The investigation did not take long.
Kaapai had gone aboard before day
break. He had Beveral long and appar
ently heavy boxes with him, which con
tained, he informed two natives whose
assistance he called in, wedding pres
ents for the King.
The wedding was postponed and the
King devoted all his energies to over
take, if possible, his defaulting officer
and recover the stolen funds. Vessels
were -sent put in all directions, and one
of the state officials was ordered to re
port the matter to the outhorities at
Apia, which is some 300 miles away.
Kaapai did not get far with his ill
gotten wealth. He was a better finan
cier than sailor, and two days after
leaving Tonga he managed to pile thÂ»
royal yacht "ii the rocks of th<- Samoan
coast. She became a total wreck, went
to pieces and carried the royal treas
ures to the bottom with her. Kaapai
managed to get ashore and reached
Apia a few days after King George's
envoy had brought the news of the rob
bery. He was promptly arrested and
thrown into jail. King George was no
tified, and the assistant Minister of Po
lice was sent to bring the culprit back
to Tonga.
Kaapai, however, had very good rea
sons for not wanting to return to the
scene of his cruel breach of trust, and
broke jail the day before the Tongan
official reached Apia. He fled to thiÂ»
woods, and so far has managed to
evade rearrest.

Meanwhile poor George was in sore
straits. He found that not only had
Kapaai taken all the ready money in
the treasury, but had been systemati
cally robbing- his royal master for over
a year, and had left the kingdom sadly
insolvent. To make matters worse,
various creditors of the crown began to
props for money. One firm appealed to
the German Vice Consul for assistance
in collecting a large obligation from
Tonga, and for while it looked as if
George would not only have to go out
of the king business, but would have

wires or of underground conduits, and
it does away with the unmechanlcal re
conversion and transmission losses of
power attendant on other systems. The
weight of the kinetic motors rests upon
springs, thus avoiding the great damages
tors and England and Germany.
Thi9 appeal to the German represen
tative caused George considerable
trouble. The firm had advanced money
to the crown, and was owed a large
sum by a number of the natives. The
natives, by International law, cannot
contract debts, yet the German Vice
Consul, in a series of interviews with
King George, and despite the fact that
Tonga is within the sphere of British
influence, threatened that all private as
well as public debts must be forthwith
discharged or hp would seize Vavua

Alarmed at this turn in his affairs,
George appealed to the British Consul
and then bent to Apai for Attorney
William J. Xapler, in whose hands he
placed the whole affair. The trouble
was amicably arranged and George was
allowed to turn his attention to making
up the deficit in the treasury and re
storing the solvency of his kingdom.
Meanwhile the proposed polygamous
marriage was not lost sight of and was
the subject of discussion at every meet
ing of the Great Council. When it be
came evident that the ministers rvould
bring considerable pressure to bear on
the King in order to dissuade him from
flying in the face of all precedent and
setting a bad example to his people,
the friends of the two brides began to
get anxious about their chance of form
ing an alliance with the royal family.
Then there were other Tonga belles
who thought they would look well sit
ting beside George on the royal throne.
They had friends, and every member of
the Council and -yen the King himself
was kept busy standing off the im
portunities of the candidates for the
royal hand. .
George finally agreed to submit o the
advice of his friends and promised to
try and get along with just one bride.
The problem of selection was loft by
the King to his advisers, and accord
ing to a dispatch received here a few
days ago they have limited the candI
dates to the two originally selected.
The girls will draw lots for the hand of
King George.
The native-; have agreed to submit to
an extra tax in order to make up the
amount of the treasurer's defalcation,
and affairs In Tonga are beginning to
look up again.
King George, the center of all the
tangle, is about 24 years of age, and is
said to be a particularly bright young
man. He speaks, In addition to his
native Tongan, French, German and
English. He surrounds himself with ~-S
much of the p r mp of royalty ns hia
exchequer will allow, and when he ap
pears in public always wears an
elaborate military uniform. Hia king
dom, in spite of reverses and dishonest
officials, is quite prosperous. His sub
jects are indolent, but manage to turn
out a large number of cargoes of cocoa
nuts and copra every year. The ex
ports of Tonga In 1897 amounted to
Â£240,000.
Tonga is a civilized and independent
nation, possibly the oldest in tue world,
and the ancestors of the reigning ..ion
arch have been seated on the throne
from time immemorial. This kingdom
is shrunken in size and power, but it
once held as tributary provinces all the
island groups in that part of the Pacific
ocean. Even in the days of Captain
Cmk the kings of Tonga regarded Fiji
and Samoa as within their dominions.
The King of Tonga had made treaties
with only two nations â Great Britain
and the United States. A singular re
sult of this is seen in the monetary
system of the kingdom, all accounts
being kept, not in pounds, shillings and
pence, but in dollars, shillings and
pence.

brated and the financial standing of
Tonga restored. King George will make
an effort to enter into diplomatic rela
tions with European nations with the
view of increasing the trade and pros

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JULY 2, 1999,
to be borne in upon me that the ship was awake with screamlnp and the
trampling of frightened feet, ami t lieu the interpretation of these things
came to me in a Hush. We were in collision.
A man snatched open my door, stammered out, "We're going down!
Oh, what shall I do?" and ran away shouting. The ship was full of noise
and darliness and hammering. The propeller had stopped, no light came
when 1 turned the electric switch, and we had so heavy a list to starboard
(my side) that already the ports were covered most of the time. It was
precisely clear that the steamer was in a had way, and one's first and most
natural instinct was to bolt for the upper decks*.
I'm ashamed to say that 1 had already rushed outside the door with this
idea before 1 pot my wits in hand, again. But then I pulled myself up and
went ha<k and dragged en some heavy serge clothes over my pajamas and
added boots and a whisky flask, after which I pounded off along the alley
ways tn the room which Mrs. Codrington shared with the Vanrennan girl.
The door of it was slamming noisily with '.he roll of the ship. I looked
inside. The place was empty, and from "in of the darkness came a swirl
of water, which ran coldly about my knees. I guessed they had gone to
the upper deck and ran there myself with the best of pace. There was a
reel about the steamer that I knew. She lay down sodden and numb in the
sea and ruse to the waves no more. 1 had felt that sluggish, sullen roll
before on another ship. We had found her drifting and boarded her In
midocean, and had just time to leave her decks before she sank down to
the â  cean floor. The mÂ»il Bteamer was truing to repeat that diveâ and sho
was carrying a thousand human lives.
The bridge deck lay atilt like the roof of a house, and it was carpeted
with humanity. Prom the upper bridge 'rockets climbed up high into the
night in one in ver-ending stream of yellow flame. Orders, prayers, shrieks
and threats were being hurled about in every tongue that Europe knows.
The stokehold crews, mad with fear, were raging like devils unchained
round the grips and chocks of the lifeboats. Naked emigrants were there
them. Sick men. who could hardly crawl, tore at the boat awnings with
their teeth. The ship's officers and the few deckhands were swept aside
like straws.
Then a bi How from ih" steam siren drowned all the clamor, and at ihat
Instant the moon slid out and burned like a great white lamp through a
gap in the racing clouds. A shout could not be heard above the din and the
shouts died away white the trembling fingers fumbled on at boat grips and
rived at the stops on the falls. Then the captain on the upper bridge let
go the lanyard of the siren and gave his orders before the silence could be
broken.
"Keep your heads and all will be saved," he cried in German. "Women
stand by the starboard boats and men away to port. Boat crews to their
stations. I will shoot t lie first swine that disobeys me." Then he repeated
the words in English ;'ii<l French and Norsk, till his cry was lost once more
in the rasing clamor.
Now, for myself I lia<l seen the uselessness of thinking- about my own
iiidr till matters were somewhat further advanced, and I remembered
(with grim amusement) how I had offered to heavily Insure two ladies'
lives for the trifling premium of two copper coins; So from the moment
of coming out on deck I had been employed in hunting for these charges
firming the mob, and had not been sparing vigor in th- process. Ther^ werÂ«
&00 people wedged Into one group, and it was not a possible thins to go
through these singly. Ho T had gone round outside the bulwark rail, occa
sionally climbing Up bj a stanchion or a st.-iy. and had gazed down on thÂ«
huddle fit" faces from above; and when I found the two that were wanted
1 fought my way to them with elbow or shut tist as required Mrs. Cod
rini,t< n wore .1 flannel dressing gown, ami as the other girl had turned out
in a singularly becoming garment of cot tori I gave her my own pilot jacket,
and stole also for her (by brute force) a spotted carriage rug from a
Polish Jew.
â â .Nov.." 1 said, "there's string in the pocket of that jacket, an 1 i his
thing will make you an elegant skirt. You'd much better stop being fright
ened, arid then we can get along more comfortably. JTou aren't going |to
gel drowned, or anything like it. I've insured you for ciim)<i apiece to van

these fuois have stopped struggling and squealing you shall go off in a bis
boal and join another steamer. We shall have ten round us in half an
hour. Look at those rockets."
Mrs. Codrlngton gripped my arm. "Then you think we have a chance
ofâ" shf began, and "Hmâ mâ mâ m" said tin- great steam born from
above.
When we could hear ourselves speak again, and while the captain was
giving his orders from the upper bridge, the purser came to my elbow.
"Here, Calvert." he said in nay ear. "you're a man. Those pon boats
won't lower any way; slit's listed too much over. I don't know whether
we can get the starboard boats in the water without swamping, with this
sea running, but we've got to try; and if any one goes off in them except
the boat crews it's got to be the women and kids. Same old yarn, y' know.
So you've got to peg out anyway, and you may as well do It In a way
that'll make you respect yourself. Ah, would you?" He knocked down a
frantic German who was battling his way toward one of the starboard
boats with .1 revolver outstretched. He wrenched away the weapon ;in*l
gave it me. "Here's a gun, old man. Just you wire in and murder the
swine If they try to swamp you. They'll soon see those port boats won't
lower, and they'll b< back here in a minute."
Now ;â¢ peculiar feeling had come over me 1 had made up my mind
thai I had got to die. and didn't waste time by being sorry for myself over
it. Ail my brain was turned on two objects. First, I had got to keep my
ticket clean' by seeing that the two girls 1 was looking after were sent
away clear of the moss. And second, I wanted to leav< a verj red mark
on the cowards who were wasting other people's lives because they could
not save their own. That last wish amounted to a mania. I was ashamed
o:' being :i man while some of those brutes lived and could call themselves
men also.

people. Bui before she \fas in the writer the after fail had jammed in th.;

EXCELLENT TEA CAN BE GROWN IN AMERICA.
"When an American makes up his
mind that he can do something, he gen
erally does it. There was a man down
in Pinehurst, S. C, several years ago
who decided that tea could* be grown
there BM well as in Asia, and the result
| is that tea is being raised there in suf
; ficient quantity for commercial pur
! poses, and of such a fine quality that
I it commands $1 a pound at retail.
Asiatic tea experts say that tea can
not be grown successfully where there
i.s not at least 80 to 100 inches of rain
fall annually. Pinehurst averages 46
inches. Asiatic experts say tea cannot
be grown in a region where there nre
frosts. Pinehurst has frosts. It has
been asserted, too, that tea growing is
impracticable, except where there i.s the
cheapest kind of labor to be obtained
for the picking.
Dr. Charles U. Shepard laughs at
peasantsâ fleeing from the conscription: Italian thieves, Belgian stokersâa
foul gush from the dregs of Europe; and with them came men who OUgnl

infection of ten or. ,

stood with my back against the gunwale. One of the mates, a gigantic
Swede, rose ui> beside me. his teetn. gritting with fury, and a belaying pm
gripped in his hand. Three deckhands were sweating and swearing at tne
falls, getting the bout- lifted oft her chodks and swung outboard.
The other women on the decks were knocked down and stamped nn,
and the mob of men leaped at the boat. It was no time for words. 1 ru
inate and 1 hit out at every face we could reach with savage fury, but none
turned to hit again. They scrabbled at the boats gunwales with their
hands, and those behind tore the leaders back. 1 could have heat in their
faces in my hate; butâ l could not bring myself to shoot; there was noth
ing there worthy or* a bullet.
The boat was lifted from its bed and swung outward. The steamer
had ceased to roll, and the seas were coming green on her bridge deck
rail. The boat was floated almost before the falls were let go, and a wavf
came U9 and swayed her clear. The crowd shrieked and drew back up
the planting decks. .
I leaned up against a davit, my breath returning: to me in laooreu
pants. But the Swedish mate left me, and if ever murder showed m a
man's eyes. I saw it gleaming from his then: and shrieks coming through
the darkness told what his fury was doing. He, at any rate, 1 told my
self, would die warm.
But the lust for maiming had left me. The last of the boats had gone,
and the women and children who were left had got to die with us men
and with those who were infinitely less than men. The rockets were 'till
spouting up in unwearied series from the upper bridge, and once 1 saw
the purser pass me. iaunty as of yore, with a lit cigar in his fingers and an
assurance between his teeth thiit all would be well. But I heeded him
little. The chill of death was nipping me with its agues, and the hopeless
minutes were dragging out intolerably. With a lifebelt i mightâ but no;
there were* women left, and I had got to stay.
Then of a sudden there burst out a roar, and a clang of iron, and ?.
gush of scalding steam; and the decks ripped and splintered, and the steam
rushed down i:i gray, peeling clouds. No, not that death. 1 vaulted the
rail ai d sank.

pickers. The gardens were not exten

employed, and it was very difficult to
get the pickers together when they
were wanted. Dr. Shepard puzzled over
this problem for quite a long time, but
finally solved it.
The quality of tea produced depends
to a very great degree upon the selec
tion of the proper leaves in picking,
and the high price obtained for the
Pinehurst teas is due very largely to
the care exercised in selecting the
proper leaves. The pickers are trained
to distinguish by the touch the leaves
which are just right for picking and
to pass over all the other leaves. As
a result the teas put upon the market
are remarkably uniform in grade, and
do not have such a large percentage
of undeveloped leaves as in the case
with most Imported teas, especially
those from China, '

It was a magnificent morning, and do
you know I really half enjoyed the idea

would be simply frantic. He was, too.
"I had been thinking what I meant to
do. I wajÃ sore that the creeks all

were ranches all alone: on Eel River.
Now. obviously if I followed a creek,

about finding a creek. It sound? such
an eaÃy thing to doâ just go into the
valleys and there is where the creeks
are.
"It was late in the afternoon before
I did at last find one. I tried to follow
a trail, thinking they were all made by :

There were quantities of wild strawber

ing I did. There was a noise in the
brush, nnd I was awfully frightened.
I thought I heard a voice. I waited
and Harebell kept right at my feet and
sneaked behind me. There was a big
brown stump about a hundred yards
aheard on a little plateau all by itself.
I thought by pettins to it I could have
a chance to look about and rest a few
minutes. Harebell would not follow.
He seemed to prefer the water, so I
went alone. I was so tired I didn't
have much sense left, and I thought if
the 'log didn't want to come he could
stay.
"Do you know I thought I was al
ready beginning to lose my reason?
The stump gave a low growl and then
Btarted off up the steep hillside. I had
been on the lookout every moment for
bears, and yet you cannot think how
queer T felt for a minute. Then I re
alized that I had taken a big brown
boar for a stump.
"T sat right down and made up my
mind that some of the bear stories I
had heard wen- not true.
"I just trudged on and on all day.
and I think I saw very little nor had
much of an idea of what T was doing.
"The next day almost nt ni^ht I
found a great empty barn. There was
some hay and several bags of salt in a
small shed, so I made up my mind there
must be some one living In that part
of the world. I looked for a trail, but
there were not less than three and all
overgrown and unused. A little after,
three cows and some calves suddenly
appeared on the top of a hill. They
stood a few minutes, loked at me, and
then away they went as if they did not
care to meet me.
"I went back to the barn and lay
down on the hay to sleep. I began to
feel as if I could not go much further.
My feet ached and had been blistered
the first day. T had a pair of water
proof shoes coming to my linees. and
with a thick hob nailed sole. They had
moose skin lacings and when I was
having them fitted the man who sold
them had said jokingly:
" 'Tf you get hungry, you know you
can live for days on those shoe strings."
I began to think I would soon have
to either eat my dog or my shoe strings
1 unless something happened.
"In the night I was wakened by
Harebell. He was howlingâ loner, deep,
soul-stirring howls. I listened awhile
and then I went to see what was the
matter. There was nothing to be seen,
and I think ho was only homesick. I
made him lie down in the hay. i>ut he
pot up and bepan to howl. It was the
first time I had cried, but I did then.
I cried and Harebell howled. Then we

alive, well and happy, and spends
: his time in the vicinity of his humble
home out- near Gough and Lombard
streets. And lie says that he owes his
long life, to a plentiful diet of cabbage and
; tobacco.
; His brown, shriveled skin is tightly
drawn over his skull, and his deep-set
eyes are dull and almost dead. His dark,
; bony hands remind you of a skeleton,
â¢and his touch sends a shiver through you.
He does not- seem like a being of this
world.
But the old man is able to pet around
pretty lively, even though, he does have
to grope his way a â â â â 'â  deal. A little
blindness is to be expected at 113 years of
age. He attends to all the work about
his little cabin, takes care of the yard,
and has time to feel a deep interest in a
family of white rabbits that he keeps for
pets.
The story of Appi Mum Modi's life Is
somewhat "remarkable, and the wonder 13
that he has been able to crowd it into the
113 years to which he lays claim.
His father was one of the native princes
whose power and glory have departed.
The first fifteen years of his life he
passed among the tawdy splendors of a
native court, until at last his adventur
ous disposition. Bred by tales of an out
side world, told by wandering seamen, he
'. â â  behind home and people and dis
guised as a low caste native stowed away
on a trading vessel bound for Singapore.
His stay in Singapore came to - sum
mi end through an encounter with sail
! ors from a British man-of-war then an
chored in the harbor. A mess boy was
needed and Add! Maru , Modi drew j the
attention of the sailors. He was invited
1 to go on board. He refused. His protest
was overruled and he was shanghaied on
board the man-of-war, when the "cat"
persuaded him to bear his lot with as
; sumed resignation. .
A long cruise through the waters of the
Malaysian archipelago finally ended at
Calcutta. Here he was sold to provide
, the means for a drunken carouse for his
late shipmates. His purchaser was the
skipper of a little trading vessel,, cruis
; ing among the Islands of the Philippine
! j group. Five years he spent among S-paln'.s
â  loosely held island possession.- During
those five years he visited island after
island from Mandandoro to the Sulu
j group. This was eighty-five years ago.
j The Spaniards even then, he says, were
! fighting the natives. His most vivid
recollection, of Manila was a compactly
: j built city on the bank of- a sluggish
' i stream, surronded on three sides by high
! walls, the river forming the other bound
i i ary.

A Personal Expression of Opinion for
Last FÂ° ur th Â°f July of the Nineteenth) Cen
of National Patriotic Celebration. The Best
THE day deicated to martial mu
sic, bursting bombs and patrunie
expression is now close at hand
âthe great, the grand, the glo
rious day that gave us our na
ional independence.
The clamor and enthusiasm of recent
mttles have vitalized the spirit of jubi
ation in citizen and soldier to almost
lational frenzy.
The preparation for the Fourth of
uly, 1599, emphasizes the fact that
jatriotism is a living thing and gives
i promise t'> <he future welfare of the
Fnion. "What the natal day means to us
his year and how we can best spend
t has been discussed by the leading
henâ statesmen and soldiers of the
lation, and here are their opinions:
:elebrate the day
by patriotic love
There never was a time in our na
ion's history when the celebration of
ndependence day should so impress
vely remind us of the mci I sig
iflcance of its commemoration.
The day is celebrated, not because or.
he fourth day of July certain English
olonies in America declared their free
om and independence, but because on
hat day the first step was taken on
his continent toward trusting Jiuman
;overnment to the control and manage
aent of the people to be governed. This
eflection leads to the further thought
hat such a project could never have
ieen entertained except in the faith and
'xpectation that those intrusted with
elf-government would guard and cul
ivate that unselfish and self-sacrificing
levption to their scheme of govern
ment which is absolutely essential to its
lurity and safety.
Inasmuch as this sentimmt is the life
f our institutions, and because they
re threatem-d with the stifling atmos
ihere of selfishness and cupidity, we
hould so commemorate Independence
ay as to stimulate and intensify a pa
riotic love of <>ur government for its
\\n sake, while our rejoicing should be
ired by the extent to which we
nd all our countrymen are imbued
.ith this feeling.
JROVER CLEVELAND, New Jersey.
V PEOPLE WHO CAN
GOVERN 'THEMSELVES
I believe that every year added to the
ge of the republic should be an addi
i'rnal reason for a greater celebration,
nd I do not mean by celebration the
lere booming of cannon orthe parading
f civilians and soldiers unon our thor
ughfares. It should be a greater cele
iration because another milestone has
!>. added to the life of the great rg
iublic, the greatest which ever existed.
The longer the life of a nation the
nore complete is the demonstration of
he idta that our people are fully capa
>le of self-government.
To know how much we have to re
oice over, we should turn our eyes to
>oor struggling France, torn once in al
nost every twelvemonth by some con
lict, which threatens her very exist
ence as a nation. Now it is Dreyfus,
>ut a short while ago it was the Royal -
sts and previous to that Boulanger.
On this Fourth of July, in the thank
'ulr.ess of our own unity, we should ex
tend to the sister republic our sym
pathy in her trouble. She is becoming
setter able to govern herself and who
shall say that o-ut of the terrible bap
ism of dissension through which she Is
passing shall not come that love of
true equality and justice upon which
must be founded a government by the
people.
The past year has given us additional
reason to celebrate our successes in
arms as well as our greatness as a na
tion. I believe we should leave the
Fourth of July as a common heritage
to all mankind; for it brings with it
each year a lesson of freedom and
shines out as a beacon of hope over all
the earth to the toilers for civilization
and liberty. It is the day upon which
every man should renew his allegiance
to his country and promise her the best
service in his power.
We can best spend it by offering up
prayers and praises for the living de
fenders of our Union and by cherishing
the memories of our dead heros.

THE DAY SEEN FROM
POLICE STANDPOINT
I have something to say about th^
way the Fourth of July should be cele
brated. Noise seems to be a necessary
aceumpanirtiwt of exhibited patriotism.
I hope this year that it will be less
dangerous than usual. I hope that
fewer buildings will be burned because
of It. and fewer fingers and toes blown
off by the explosions which go with
it. 1 am also opposed to the too free
use of firearms on Independence day.
Firearms cultivate a desire to shoot,
and Hi n always to shoot without bul
leta
The Fourth, being a holiday, also of
fers a good opportunity for merry
making am^ng that class to whom
liquor is a necessary ingredient of a
gmd time. The combination of fire
works and fire-water always Rives us
an unusually large number of crimes
to look after on the Fourth of July.
About the best way that I can think
of to celebrate the Fourth of July is
to refrain from burning buildings,
mutilating yourself with th>- pistol that
isn't loaded, mutilating other folks
with the pistol that is loaded, and get
ting drunk. THOMAS F. BYRNES,
The World-Famous Detective and
Former Chief of Police of New
York City.
HAVE A BIG PARADE
AND ROUSING FETE
The fact that crops are bad or that
legislation Is slow is not a good reason*
for forgetting to be proud of our big
gest achievement as a nation. It !s
true, however, thai we are losing our
enthusiasm on the two occasions,
when we ought most to display it â the
Fourth of July and Decoration day.
Each of These, in my opinion, deserves
about as much celebration as the other.
Although I do not believe in mere
noise on the Fourth, we ought at least
to have a bip parade and a soul-stir
ring fete. Whr>n I was a boy these
things were a delight and an inspira
tion to me. On Decoration day every
veteran who can march should march,
and every other who is able to be
out at all should have place in a car
riage in the- line. To me the grandest
expression of patriotism is a limping
veteran with a Grand Army button In
his lapel. Xn: hard times or not, we
should celebrate the Fourth of July.
Perhaps we won't all of us be able to
buy as many skyrockets, pinwheeld.
and Roman candles this year as usual,
but patriotic enthusiasm costs nothing,
and is absolutely the most nourishing
food that can be fed to a nation.
GEORGE F. SHRADY, M. D..
The Doctor Who Attended Grant and
Garfield.
ALL MEN MUST HAVE
LIKE CONSIDERATION
The celebration of the Fourth of July
will be of little use unless it leads us to
consider what legislation, if any, is nec
essary to continue and increase the
prosperity of our people.
It is well on each Fourth of July to
have read and considered the Declara
tion of Independent o, especially that
part declaring as one of the self-ovi
dent truths that "all men are created
equal." In these times, when special
Interests and more influential classes
are demanding, and too oft^en obtain
ing beneficial legislation, we cannot
keep too constantly in mind the fact
that the humblest citizen is entitled to
the same consideration from the Gov
ernment as the greatest.

EXTOL THE DEEDS OF
OUR BRAVE SOLDIERS'
The Fourth of July this year has
special significance because it is the
first Fourth since the promulgation of
peace with Spain involvin.er the tri
umph of our arms by land and sea and
the contemplation by the country of
the "spoils of war." When our coun
try is fighting, and especially on jubi
lee ocasions, it is not timely to be crit
ical. It is sufficient for us to know
that our Government is waging war In
a remote land and that our soldiers
are fighting and dying for their coun
try's cause. The national dignity and
honor must be upheld and the officers
and men who are engaged in the con
flict should have our encouragement
and support and the officers and men
who have died fighting should be held
in patriotic thought and reverent mem
ory. Their deeds should be the fheme
of public addresses and their valor
should be extolled as reflecting honor
upon their families and their countrv
urn. No soldiery the world has ever
known has shown more endurance,
-â ourage and energy than the young
men who went from their comfortable
homes to brave the dangers of an un
known and hostile land. History will
enshrine their virtues, but we. who live
in the year of the war. should give en
couragement to the men at the front
by sons?, triumpha". processions and
monuments. On the breast of every
returning soldier we should place a
medal of honor, which he can hand
down to his remotest generation as a
testimonial of the appreciation of a
grateful people.
JAMES D. PHELAX, Mayor.
SNEERS NO LONGER,
RESPECT ENFORCED
Natal day is the one day of all others
which should be fittingly remembered
by the American people. The birthday
of our republic, the day upon which
we threw off the yoke of the mother
country and formed a government for
ourselves, should be made even greater
than it is. Every year is adding to its
glory, as it gathers luster from its vic
tories. Tho memory of Washington
and the heroes who struggled with him
are ever with vp â examples to emulate.
Ours is a history of wonderful
achievement and great growth. We
stand as on^ of the foremost nations in
the world in Bcience and literature, as
well as in might. The Spanish war was
the first evidence that we give to others
era of our power and to them it came as

THE WORKINGMEN ARE
OUR NATIONAL BRAWN
If there is any day in the calendar
that workingmen ought to celebrate,
it Is the Fourth of July. The
workingmen are the brawn of a
nation. No great battle was ever
won without them. No great battle
ever can be won without them. With
out the men who work with their
hands we would never have had in
dependence, and we would never have
had Independence day. Without the
men who work with their hands we
never can keep independence. The
workingmen of America should cele
brate the Fourth or July this year and
every other year, because it is an an
niversary of the birth of the means by
which they can maintain thf-ir liberty,
defend their rights and work out
their own emancipation. They have
in the past demonstrated their ability
to defend themselves against those
who doubt the wisdom of government
"of the people, for the people and by
the people." and because of the Fourth
of July and what it stands for they
will he in a position to do it again, if
occasion ever demands, as long as the
world lasts. SAMUEL GOMPERS.
Chief American Federation of Labor.
A GREAT VICTORY,
GLORIOUS PEACE
What does Independence day mean
to us this year? It carries a greater
significance to the civilized world than
ever before. On Fourth of July one
year ago we rejoiced at the annihila
tion of the Spanish navy by Sampson's
fleet, and since that time we have left
no vestige of naval or military pres
tige to our erstwhile antagonist. We
have won a glorious peace in a glo-
I
rious fight. That is surely a cause of
celebration.
While we are still engaged fighting
the Filipinos, Â«'uba and Porto Rico
been added to our already magnificent
country, and absolute peace will be
with us ere long. We have gained more
glory as a nation in the space of one
jShort year than we had any reason to
expect at the outset of hostilities.
1 know that the policy of expansion
is condemned by some of our people,
who seem to think that in departing
from the beaten paths of precedence
we are making a great mistake. Upon
that head I shall say nothing. But it
seems to me that since, by the unani
mous consent and will of the people,
war was precipitated it would
be only Just to commemorate the na
tions anniversary by voicing senti
ments of loyalty to the administra
tion.
The policy that has been pursued
could not to my mind have been rea
sonably different. The responsibilities
we have assumed are the growth of
circumstances. It may be good poll
tica to hamper and embarrass an ad
ministration, but it certainly exhibits
but very little patriotism. \Ve should
present a solid front to the enemy un
til he is vanquished and then adjust
our differences among ourselves.. The
Fourth of July observed in the proper
spirit can only serve to accentuate our
unity.
In that has been our strength, and
we Bhould guard It well. As to the
manner of celebrating Declaration day
I know of no better way than to fol
low Time-honored custom. Young
Americans should be taught its full
significance and the duty of fittingly
remembering it.
WILLIAM n. SHAFTER,
Major General U. S. A.
THE GREATEST POWER
IN MILITARY FORCE
Fourth of July of this year means
that we shall be placed upon a military
footing in the eyes of the world that
we have never occupied before â it
should mean the annihilation of the
sentiment that is disloyal to the admin
istration and a fostering of the feeling
that should give strength to both civil
and military law.
In one short year we have sprung from
a factor of zero to the greatest power
of any nation in military force. Prior
to this time the little that we did have
was not considered a factor to be ap
preciated by foreign powers, but now
all this has changed, and the celebra
tion of Independence day commemor
ates a birthday of our importance to
the civilized world.
Our Fourth of July orations should
not be of dead past issues. The past Is
a rinsed volume and the affairs of to
day should instill loyalty to our Gov
ernment and support of the administra
tion no matter what course it may see
fit to pursue.
Wholesome enthusiasm. whether
caused by the battery of words or pow
der, is bound to create courage and stir
oi;r brave men to greater deeds of
valor.
We cannot hope too much: we can
not celebrate too much for the. glorifi
cation of the greatest day in the his
tory of our Union.
MAJOR RAY,
Commander of the District of Alaska.
SPEND THE DAY AS
NOISILY AS WE CAN
The celebration of the Fourth of July
will certainly mean more to us this
year than it has heretofore, be
cause we will celebrate the victories of
the period and not the memory of his
torical achievements.
The Fourth of July now commemor
ates a new era of patriotism, a feeling
which has steadily but surely waned
during; these years of peace, and one
tint at last has burst into an honest
enthusiasm as generous as it is na
tional. It needed, perhaps. ;i measure
as stringent as that of war to stimu
late patriotic devotion in our country's
welfare. It has not been so very long
apo since our lack of zeal In this mat
ter was more than demonstrated. I re
fer to the time when the question of
raisins th^ flag over the public schools
was agitated. Several objections were
made, and for awhile such strenuous
opposition was brought to bear that it
seemed indeed rather doubtful that Old
Glory would wave over the institutions
of learning. Bu,t now all of that feel
ins has been swallowed up in the new
md nil pervading sentiment born of
our late victories. It Is broadcast, and I
Americans, whether they be in the <
countries bordering on the north seas, <
the tropics of the east or the islands <
of the southland, are inspired to cele
brate Independence day as it never has '
been observed before. â 
It is expedient that we spend the day
as noisily as we can, for In times of j
peace gunpowder and cheers, may be re- :
lied upon to evoke the spirit of Patria, '
when the reading of the declaration of
independence might fail.
The pyrotechnic display of such
scenes as the battle of Manila Fay and
the sinking of the Merrimae will 'In
more to arouse the love of country than
all of the prayers and orations that
could be uttered..
For my part, I would like to see the
sky aglow with the blaze of pyrotech
nic art. It is not an extravagance to
glorify with bunting and powder the
preservation of our Union. Such ova
tions to our flag but strengthen our loY

THE LADY OF THE LIBRARY
Mi RS. GRUNDT has been book-
I Yvu browsing-, or rather Mrs.
/! /A \\ Grundy has been lolling in
ci iSvs v> libraries. Mrs. Grundy has
not even oast half an eye on the book
shelves, reserving both her orbs for
the Lady of the Library.
Mrs. Grundy does not approve of the
Lady of the Library. Mrs. Grundy be
lieves in giving her thoughts voice, and
Society, plural number, common gen
der, believes in lending an ear to Mrs.
Grundy. Fastidious Mrs. Grundy!
Fortunate Society! Foolish Lady of
the Library!
Mrs. Grundy disdains sugar-coating.
Her criticisms must leave a bitter
taste in the mouth of the Lady of the
Library. Not that Mrs. Grundy has
spoken directly to that young person.
That. -would be against the ethics of her
art of covert criticism. She has
breathed the whisper and women's
clubs; and congresses and mothers'
meetings and sewing circles are ring
ing loud with the subject.
Mrs. Grundy has taken library ex
cursions before. She fumigated them
with the antiseptic of indignation. As
a result the shelves were pruned of the
fruits of the pen that Mrs. Grundy de
clared not fit. Then Mrs. Grundy took
to fields fresh, and the libraries
thought they were struck off her call
ing list.
The supply of material for tongue
wagging has been well up to the de
mand, so it cannot be for want of a
better target that Mrs. Grundy has
again opened fire on the libraries.
Mrs. Grundy has given notice to the
Lady of the. Library. She will either
have to obey Mrs. Grundy's p's and q's
or suffer Mr*;. Grundy's gossip.
Mrs. Grundy says libraries are sup
posed to be places to read in or to ob
tain reading matter from.
Granted, Mrs. Grundy! But who
under the heavens ever thought they
were designed, for anything else?
To which interrogation Mrs. Grundy
shrugs her shoulders and elevates her
eyebrows. Done into Queen's English
this sign language means that libraries
are more than places to read in or from
which to obtain reading matter.
"You can see for yourselves," says
Mrs. Gz*undy.'
You can. On any day except the Sab
bath, at any library excepting none. At
any hour, but more" especially near the
hours when the human family plies the
knife and fork.
You'll be able to fill up Mrs. Grundy's
blank. " .-.,
You'll discover that libraries are
places to read, to obtain reading mat
ter from and to keep appointments
â¢with friends. And you'll likewise
learn that the friend of the Lady of
the Library not infrequently wears a
mustache.

there t- verify Mrs. Grundy.
A gray-haired gentleman with the
manners of a Chesterfield and the brow

deserted the printed page for the clock.

clock and the gentleman and in a
stage whisper informed him that "she
couldn't make it any sooner." They
left the library, followed by every eye
in the room. A girl to the left of me
whispered to a neighbor:
'"Don't yc-u know who he is? Oh, yes,
he is. 1 know ail the family. He's a
dreadful flirt if he is a gray-beard."
We settled back to our books, but
with the alert air of ready for the next.
We did not have to wait long. At the

sauntered in. He bowed with f< I

"Why. yes," said the youth wise be
yond his years.
For by the hearing <>f my auricular
appendages I swear that she did not
mention in which direction her path
lay. Can ii be that he was previously
informed and that their meeting was
noi as accidental as they would have
had us believe?
For a time it looked as though the
library was settling down to the busi
ness for which its founders Intended it.
Girls with lunch baskets entered and
took the staii-s to the lunchroom which
lirectors have thoughtfully pro
vided. Pe< pie came and went with
their books. None of the human fix
tures had the expectani air of await
any particular arrival.

We left the library to >eturn again
at 4 o'clock. A girl in a black t

just ahead of us.
"Hello, Amelia," said a friend to the

"Sorry, Ethel, but I can't. I'm wait

not a few of her afternoons at the

I felt a dig from her sharp elbow.
"See that girl over there, the one with
the dinky Knos ?"
1 happened to know the girl, but I
held my peace.
"Every time she comes," continued
this past grand mistress of the argot of
the hour, "she meets a fellow and he
walks home with her â I've followed
them. He's dead swell, and I've got an
awful crush on him myself."
The "(lead swell" arrived. He proved

"dinky Knox." Polly Pry looked a

"Wouldn't that make you sick?" said
Polly Pry a little later, pointing to a

the library. Three young girls were
ogling over the tops of their books a

a retreat. A few minutes later two of

of. the biggest timber firm in the section,
to attend a mountain dance, and I was
there having as good a time as a man
can have who doesn't dance, even the
old-fashioned Quadrilles and that kind.
At the moment in question I was "sit
ting out a dance" with the prettiest
mountain girl of the whole neighborhood,
and I was mildly jollying her about not
being married. She was 24, which is old
maidhood in the mountains, except in the
case of very pretty girls, of whom there
aro very few among the mountaineers.
"I could marry ef I wanted to, 1 rook

"Yes, there's Jim Mullins. He wants

asked with a little more directness than

composition of ,J. H. Wiffen of London, a

poem is a spirited ballad of flfty-two
stanzas, and describes the rape of the
tulismanic goblet from a fairy banquet â¢
by the good Lord Musgrave. Toward It* .
conclusion the ballad runs:
Joy to thy banner, bold Sir Knight!

your love will be lost and your friends |
will not be lasting ones. When you in- .
trust your money to others you run a !
great risk. If you handled it yourself
you would be more fortunate. In all mat

cumstances happen which you yourself
cannot help or govern.
MISS SMITH. Sherman Island. Sacra
mento â You are possessed of a firm will.
Many of your desires in tne way of travel
will be accomplished in the future. You
have a jovial nature; inclined to extrava- j
K&nce, but you can afford it. as you wiil '
be wealthy. At times you are gloomy. j
hut you should overcome that and take
as much enjoyment from life as possi- i
ble.
A. G. P., Cityâ You will be m-irried
twice. You are a great student of truth,
science and art. You have a kind and
generous heart. Planetary influences un
der which you were born are unfortunate.

You are very inventive, logical and of a
determined though cheerful nature. The
power to control your destiny rests en
lirely with yourself, and by determined

will be a success.

AND FRECKLES
This department is for the benefit of all those who are interasted in
the science of cosmetics and the hygiene of proper living. If any one
desires information on either of these subjects the questions will be
cheerfully answered in these columns. Write as often as you like, ask
as many questions as you please and sign any name that you choose. Ad
dress all communications to Mme. Hygeia, The Sunday Call.
FRECKLES, although the disturber
woman's otherwise
are not such
terriMe things after all. That is,
unless they are particularly large
and black and tenacious. Thjre
ore lots worse tilings. An empty purse

It is a risky proceeding. Lemon Juice Is
as strong an acid as any woman should

If you have access to new buttermilk,
you will find it an excellent remedy for
early summer freckles, particularly if a

Take on? teaspoonful of powdered borax
ay.(] dissolve it In one pint of soft water.

To those to whom the odor of butter

ing cucumber milk on the mottled skin.
I am sur.- you wiir find it delightful,
and you can ' prepare it yourself wtth
very little "â¢trouble: Eight ounces cucum
ber juice; one-fourth ounce of powdered
castile soap: two ounces of oil of sweet
almonds: three ounces essence of cu
cumbers; thirty-six drops simple tinc
ture of benzoin. Get the juice by peeling
the cucumbers, and the essence may be
obtained by mixing some of the juice
with an equal part of alcohol. I'se the
ordinary green cucumbers, and do not
peel them. Slice very thin and W.t them
COOk Quite awhile and slowly. When
they are soft and mushy remove from
the fi.-f- and strain first through a fine
sieve and then through a cloth. A large
bottleâ a gallon oneâ comes in very han
dy when making this lotion, as it must
be shaken a great deal. Place first ir
this bottle one and one-half ounces of
alcohol and one and one-half onn
cui-umber juice. Then you have your es
sence. Add to this your castile soap and
let stand until the soap is entirely dis
solved. Put in your cucumber juice which
has been strained and which is cold.
Shake well, so that all are thoroughly
mixed. Then pour it all out in a china
or porcelain vessel and add the oil of al
monds and the benzoin, stirring for
some time. When you put the mixture
into bottles be sure that it is well stirred,
else you will get most of the oi'.y matter
in one bottle ar.d the juice in the other.
Shake well before using, and apply it at
night. Let it dry on the skin, and rinse
away with tepid water the following
morning. For the falling hair use this
tonic: Forty-eight grains resorcin, one
fourth ounce glycerin, and alcohol enough
to fill a two-ounce bottle. Apply every
night to the scalp, rubbing it well in.
ELIZA P.â The "pinkish skin" is not a
t, as you seem to think, but an indi
cation that the blood circulates near the
surface, as it should. For the haJr, use
this shampoo:
Take 5 cents' worth of borax and the
same quantity of powdered castile soap.
Add to this the yolk of an egg, well beat
en, and a pint of warm water. Put this
in a bottle and cork it tightly. Shake un
til you have a fine lather. If carefully
corked after using it will keep in a cool
place for a long time. When using it rub
well into the scalp; wash the hair in sev
eral waters, ranging from quite hot to al
most cold for the final rinse. This will
prevent taking cold. It is not necessary
to have a toilet steamer to steam the face.
In its place use a large washbowl, rill
this with boiling water, place it on a low,
convenient stand and envelop your head
in a bath towel so that none of the steam
will escape.

Infallible cure. The chain should be
tight As the swelling grows less tae

which is making you so unhappy: One
dram sulphur, one-half dram borax, one

Your surmise about the palmistry depart

CORNFLOWERâ PIease read foregoing

DAISYâ For the brittle nails I would
suggest that you apply every night be

Then for a month visit a manicure once

a lot of questions you .tsk! However, I
guess we're equal to 'em. First of all,

There is oo rouge, powder or lotion ever
concocted that can outshine these as a
complexion brightener. You are altogether
too young to think of using such things
on your tace. The pure imported i

suggest a general building up of your
physical system as a remedy. The follow

This is the month to begin picking your
Christmas presents, girls. It does seem
queer, doesn't It, to plan for December
iv June, but if you want to get ahead iv
your hoiiday work you will be wise to take
this summertime hint.
It hasn't anything to do with fancy
work. No need to try eyes and patience
bendling over troublesome embroidery
stitches and such things. There really
isn't any work about it. Those future
presents are growing right this moment
all around you What you have to do is
merely to pick them off the bushes and â
but of course you want to know about it
from the very beginning.
Well, start in saving rose petals. The
country girl really has the best of it. be
cause by the end of summer she can have
a store of rose leaves that would make
any city girl envious. But even if you
can't find roses amid the bricks and mor
tar of your city home, surely you have
some friends out of town who own rose
bushes. Ask them for the petals, and if
you are persistent, with what flowers you
can gather yourself, by fall you should
have a fragrant collection.
Beginning in June the leaves should be
gathered, dried slowly in the sun and
packed in cardboard boxes. All during the
summer, when you can get hold of bits
of thyme, rose geranium leaves, sprigs of
lavender, sweet clover blossoms, indeed,
any scented thing from field to garden.
to add to those rose petals. Between the
layers of rose leaves sprinkle lightly a
tittle ground cinnamon, allspice, a few
Tonga bums, and, if you happen to have
on hand a stick of Japanese incense,
crumble it up and toss among the leaves
and spices. By the end of summer that
bO3( ought to be as sweet as a whole flor
ist's shop. And don't you see what a deli
cious mixture you haye â better than
sachet powder at $8 a poundâ for making
up into muslin bags?
SUMMER SPRITES
AND FASHIONS
fHAVE been studying the summer
girl on the scene of action. I should
like to tell you all about her, but the
summer girl has ten times as many
phasi b as a June rose has petals.
It is of the summer girl in frills and laces
that T am going to hold forth. She is the
same maid n who does the athletic act:
but of that anon.
The summer girl of "90 has a slim and
lissome shape, sheathed as frankly as a
mermaid in her scales, and, like a mer
maid, spreading fanlike to a graceful
train. Where are the hips of yesteryear?
Gone! Gone with the horsecar. gone with
the h.oopsklrts, gone as utterly, entirely
and absolutely! And, dear heaven: gone
so suddenly.

in hers.

the wheel, the surf, the saddle, the
weights, even the treadmill, but make
yourself over at once. Forget that you
were fashionable, for you are fashionable
no longer. What nature intended you to
be is not <>f the slightest consequence.
All natural things are not beautiful, much
less fashionable.
All of which is. of course, rather fool
ish. But. really, my dears, if you would
be the correct sumnfer girl ,:' '99 you must
be slenderâ nay, almost thin. Mile. '09
has her charmâ a sort of delicate poster
charm of long, tine lines anu nicely ad
justed angles. She gathers up her trail
ing skirts about her narrow hips with a
careless crook of her elbow. She tips her
hat well down over her brow- a bolero

a sailorâ faithful little tile, which age can
not wither nor custom Btale. She holds
herself with the ease of well-trained
muscli â¢ and shows a slim foot shod in
russet or in patent leather under her cool
foulard or cooler linen.
The summer girl of '99 comes out to
meet the morning in tailored linens or
other crisp, smart stuffs that are the
tailor's summer pride. The skirt fits her
like a French glove and with it she wears
a smashing little Eton cut by a master
hand.
She has one of these for every morning
in the week.
But it was of the daintier frock that I
was to tell you. For my lady carries
quantities of these besides her athletic
togs. The summer girl of not so many
yester seasons scorned parasols and shade
hats and men and other indispensable de
tails of the beach. She fried herself all
colors out under the summer sun. and
after her morning dip came to breakfast
with d;:rk browned locks. She pretended
not to care a farthing's flip for fashion.
She ha 1 a good time and looked as ugly
as she liked at it.
Now Mile. '!Â» does the frou-frou as well
as the athletic act. She playa both roles
with equal success. The summer girl of
'99 must be able to do the lightning
change.
The most novel dinner gown at the moÂ«t

young matron noted for her beautiiul cos

ELLA WHEELER WILCOX ON
BATHING SUITS.
THE girl sea bather is as much an
object of annual interest as the flower
show She is ever the same in variety
yet ever new even as the blossoms
are.' There are three typesâ the bather,
the swimmer and the sand poser.
Of the three the mere bather is the
least attractive to the observer. The
woman who does not swim and only
ventures into the water for her health
usually sees to it that her body is weU
covered with flannel and that her skirt
hides as much display of limb as pos
sible. If she is a thin woman or even
thin skinned she wears long sleeves and
looks exceedingly unpicturesque as she
waddles down to the edge of the surf.
and still more unpicturesque as she wad
dles back to the bathhouse after the
waves have caressed her.
But she has had her bath, solely for
the purpose of health, and she says she
does not care how she looks or what
people think about her appearance. Mean
time, she is. as a rule, very critical of the
costume worn by her swimming sister.
The girl who swims certainly makes
quite another picture as she emerges from
her dressing-room and starts for the
beach. She goes briskly, all alive with
the thought of the delicious pleasure be
fore her. She does not seem to be con
scious of her costume, but the bathing
woman says she is and declares that she
ought to be ashamed of herself, making
such a display of her person.
To be sure, there are no sleeves and
either the round arms gleam forth from
shoulder to wrist or long lisle-thread
gloves cover the too delicate flesh from
the burning rays of the sun and give the
costume an evening dress effect which the
bather cannot pardon.
The skirt is very short and rather
scant. Long stockings meet the trim
trousers just above the knee. She is a
very pretty picture, indeed, for the brief
moment she is visible.
The good swimmer never lingers long
on the shore. Perhaps she is conscious
that her skirt is short, but she knows it
Is necessarily so if she would enjoy her
swim and get its full benefit.
The sand poseT is still another being.
She gets herself up expressly to be ad
mired. She neither bathes nor swims.
Her costumes are many and beautiful,
she wears coquettish bonnets, tight cor
sets, elegant belts and expensive hose.
She is almost always pretty, and her
form suggests living pictures. In fact, it
is merely a matter of environment that
she is not on the variety stage.
She has precisely the same order of
mind that is possessed by the vaudeville
favorite. But she has money and family
and position of some port to maintain and
so she is not a professional living picture
or an artist's model, who displays her
figure for a living, but merely an ama
teur who exhibits her charms for the
pleasure she finds in being observed.
She never ventures beyond her shoe
tops in the water. She parades the beach
with an admirer on either side, ur.d she
poses in the sand under a becoming par
asol.
It would not be difficult for any of her
escorts to draw a memory sketch of her

skirt and flounce, both trimmed with the

A dear little gown is in china blue lawn
with a heavy polka dot in white and the
trimming is wnite embroidery.
The skirt has a wide flounce, headed at
the top with a band of embroidery. Th*

handsomely embroidered in colors and
has a deep knotted fringe. Both edges
of the scarf are bordered with the nar
rowest fringe in colors to match the
embroidery. There is a stock to the
bodice made of folds of pink crepe.
A pretty gown of crepe de chine is made

bands of the butter-colored lace put in so
that they start from the belt at the back
of the skirt and i'orm a sharp point in

EMPIRE SUNBCNNET.
The swell shops are showing a quaint
conceit in the shape of a sun bonnet,
which is to be used by the summer girl
when she feels inclined to stroll through
the woods and fields and lanes in her
summer outing.
Perhaps she has read in Jane Austen's
novels of how fetching and altogether
adorable her grandmother was when she
wandered in sylvan scenes, ht-r sun bon
net hanging on her shoulders, forming
such a very becoming bacground for
her very pretty face.

that calls upon the imagination for its
development â and those who do not
readily bow the knee to his works in
art, his gems In literature, must ever
remain legion. He does not draw â he
suggests drawing. He does not follow
up his wit to compel respect for it. He
says what he means and leaves his
words to their fate. From "The
Baronet and the Butterfly," a reca
pitulation, with inimitable witty mar
ginal comments by Whistler, of the
speeches of counsel, made in the ap
peal case of Sir William Eden against
Whistler for the recovery of a por
trait of Lady Eden: we quote the fol
lowing: "Mr. Whistler, gentlemen, is
capable of arraigning Nature herself,
and might have done so had she not
shown signs of grace. Sometimes Mr.
Whistler perceives that Nature is not
quite as he represents her. and he is
displeased. But one day Nature re
pented. Some one pointed out a land
scape very much like th'->se he is in the
habit of painting to Mr. Whistler.
"Yes," he observed, "Nature is reully
oreeping up!" Delicious! His "Gentle
Art of Making Enemies." now a very
rare volume, gives expression to the
artist's most delightful moods of analy
tical satire True humor is so rare that
in spite of some just and much unjust
criticism let us applaud the man who
with genius "creates circumstances"
and with talent "uses them," turning
an "amused eye" upon the public and
cystalllzing his vision into words of
entertainment for those who can hear
his whispers.

BOOKS REVIEWED.
Literature for June 16 contains a
readable article on destructive bacilli
that lurk insidiously in the literary at

that pitiable figure, the man without
reverences. No one will quarrel with

a man as he writes, wonders if any

DEGREE OF HONOR.
Dawn of Hope Lodge No. 1 of Oakland
had a most enjoyable meeting on the
night of the 24th lnst., en which occasion
there were present visitors from many
parts of the jurisdiction. As soon as the
routine business had been disposed of
there was arranged a programme of en
.tertaiuiuent, and one feature was '".Dress-
with it. Lying upon his deathbed, he
said to the doctor, "I must got vp â it is
absolutely necessary that I should write
my article. I will do only a demi-feuil
leton if 1 must, but I must do it." He
died assuring those at his bedside that
he must see "Lc- Torrent" again, for he
feared it had neither been well under
stood nor rightly judged.

THE NATIONAL UNION.
The visit of the San Francisco Cabinet
to Union Council last week was an ex
ceedingly pleasing one. There was a full
representation of the cabinet and other
visitors and al! were made to f<
home. Three candidates were initiated
by the cabinet officers for the sitting
council in the amplified form, aftor which
there were addresses by the leading of
ficers of the cabinet.
Last Tuesday night Golden Gate Coun
cil had a good meeting, and by the ini
tiation of Thomas K. Xase increased' its
membership to 3'Xj. Now that the council
has passed the 300 mark, its ambition :?
to reach the 400 notch in the matter of
membership. During the evening Sena
tor Fred H. Hastings called to say good
by to the council prior to his departure
for the session of the senate on the 10th
inst.. in company with James E. Field,
who represented California in the Senate
last year. In a recent notice of Mr. Hast
ings," :t was announced that he was past
E resident of the senate. It should hay*

no telling but he may before long become
president of the senate.

was another evening of entertainment
and instruction for. which this council is
noted. The Knickerbocker male quar- :

known in this community, then there
were a number of selections of an in- ;
strumental nature and an explanatory :

the council, and a most interesting ad- j
dress by the Rev. Alexander X. Carson |
on the subject of "Our National Faith." ;
He based his remarks on the platform of !
the order and drew from it many beauti- |
ful losses of man's duty to country,

a most entertaining manner told what
national faith is. The speaker was lis
tened to with profound attention and
what he said was loudly applauded by the
many who hfard him.

.HOW/ TO CAM?.
Here are a few things worth remember
ing if you are going to camp out this sum
mi r: Spread your tent out on the grass,
and if there are any holes mend them at
once. A few holes in a tent on a rainy
night can do more damage to the pro
visions and bedding than can be easily
remedied.
If you have not pot a canvas fly g-et on 3
if possible. Of course, every one knows
that a fly is a large piece of canvas for
stretching over the ridge pole of a tent as
a sort of second roof or covering. There
should be about eight -Inches bet-ween the
sides of a fly and the top of the tent. This
will allow plenty of air to circulate and
will do much toward making a tent com
fortable and cool.
If you don't know how to cook mpat3
and vegetables go out in the kitchen and
study a little frying pan science. Most of
all learn how to make soda biscuits. There
is nothing nicer with a good hot camp
supper than nicely browned snda hiscuit.3.
If it is possible take an old-fashioned
Dutch oven on your trip. They are inex
pensive, and a Dutch oven and a frying
pan are about all the things needed for
a first-cla^s camp kitchen. Have the box
in which the provisions are parked one
that you can use as a cupboard.
Clean dishes and a place to keep them
are among the necessities of camp life.
In making up your party choose com
panions who are not selfish. Semshness
will rust the bt-st kind of happiness in
camp. Go with the idea of making the
best of everything, and don't complain.

the idea that all the characters here represented are assumed by one and

BY ASH TON STEVENS.
AS the weeks advance our debt
to Henry Miller and Charles
Frohman, who sent him and
his company to us, increases.
The Miller season in the Co
lumbia is bringing back to us
the old-time theatrical atmosphere.
Just now we are full of surprise and
gratitude, but by and by, no doubt,
we will get back to our original opin
ion that nothing is too good for San
Francisco after all. In "The Liars"
and 'The Adventure of Lady Ursula"
we have seen two representative mod
ern plays, the former almost a master
piece, the latter a daring venture in
wit and fancy: and both pieces have
been delightfully acted. There were
jerks and waits in the opening per
formance of "Lady Ursala," as one
would have expected from a band of
players unaccustomed to the rush of
stock work, but they were soon
smoothed over, until now this produc
tion is quite as model as was the one
of "The Liars." Mr. Miller contributes
another admirable phase of his ver
sality In Sir George Sylvester. There
are humor, poise, picture and dignity in
his work in this part. Mr. Morgan,
with that naturalness and virility of
his, makes a smaller part very real, and
Miss Anglin is pimply surpassing as
the lady after whom Mr. Hope's fan
tastical romance is entitled. The dif
ficulties of this double-sexed part are
great. Preposterous, almost, seems
the whole role when you think it over
calmly at a safe distance from the
theater; but Englished as it is by Mr.
Hope and set in an atmosphere of
beauty and excitement and played as
Miss Anglin plays it. you have a stage
figure that is positively memorable for
its liveliness, delicacy and distinction.
A step too flippant, an effort to fierce,
and it would all be burlesque; but Miss
Anglin never overdoes, never under
does; her art is as sure as her per
sonality, which, from this side of the
footlights at least, is modest and unerr
ingly magnetic. Here is a young woman
who is not a beauty (again, from this
side of the footlights at least"), who does
not strike you as any great shakes
â when you first see her, but who sends
you away frr-m the playhouse with all
sorts of regard for Mary Anglin. There
is nothing tumultuous, nothing sensa
tional about her playacting; she hasn't
the boiling temperament of Bernhardt.

this anniversary in the fact that the
Tivoli was the first opera-house in
America to give performances at 50 and
25 cent prices, it pioneered the way
for such companies as the Southwell
and the Castle Square.
Prom Kipling's "L'Envoi"â "Only the
master shall praise them, and only the
master shall blame"â is suggested the
name of the new one-act play written
by Miss Charlotte Thompson, which will
be produced in the Alcazar to-morrow
night. 'Only the Master Shall Blame"
is the promising title. The Vassar girl.
the modern Lady Gay Spanker, the man
of the world and man of business are of
the personages, and the story will, we
are told, "show how those who call
themselves friends, deem themselves
lovers, can allow suspicion's miasma to
poison the atmosphere of contentment
and happiness." The author had Flor
ence Roberts in mind when writing the
play, and is said to have given her a
strong and sympathetic part. The fact
that Miss Thompson is a well known
townswoman of ours lends a special in
terest to the production.
The afterpiece is "Don Caesar de
Bazan," with Mr. Morrison as the
swaggering daredevil hero, Mr. Whit
tlesey as the King and Miss Roberts as
the Maritana.

brilliancy and effectâ a clever actor's
Hamlet) and woman Hamlets, too, it
would seem from the following:
"Bui what exquisite ideas she hasâ thp

... .'.] :Â° NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK. July The remarkable de
â¢ mind for the standard railroad stocks contin
â  .lied -.as strong to-day as it was yesterday and
â¢ applied to much the same stocks. Pennsyl
. : vania- took the foremost place, both in respect
to activity and strength. The stock showed the
'largest gain at the opening- and held its leader
, ship without change throughout the day, clos
â¢ â¢ lng ' at the top. level, i 3>i points above last
night's price. Study of the May report of earn
â¢â ;ln?S:"a-as the primary cause of the strength ol
'.this: stock, but there were also rumors in clr
'. ou.lAt!on that the Incursion of the New York
. Centra! into New England was to be followed i
; by a similar move on the part of the Pennsyl
. vania lease of the New Haven road. The sus- i
taining strength of New York Central at its
high <'level doubtless prompted some large buy
... Ing" of Pennsylvania, also paying 1 per cent
more!, per annum In dividends than New York
: - Central and selling so far under the latter. The
â¢ extraordinary railroad earnings, resulting from
evefcy- section of the country, was the motive !
.' â¢" fur buying in that department of the stock !
. .market. The grangers were all in good de
â  mand and gained a point or over in the half '
'.' . day.' s- trading. St. Paul led in point of activ- 'â 
'" iiy, : but Rock Island showed the largest gain In
, pr.tces. Burlington felt the effect of profit-tak
.' ing ,-on the publication of the May statement,
â  showing an increase in the surplus for the
;/iiusut.h of 3120.000. The Union Pacific stocks en
..-'.Toyed the benefit of a strong showing in the I
â¢ May .statement, as did N. W. preferred. Tire :
: fi riiit-r rose over a point, and the latter about
â¢ ns! ich. The early strength was largely con- I
fined to the leading railroad stocks, but became ;
.' .general r.i the publication of the bank state
â ; rn.ent and on covering by shorts, who were dis
- appointed on the market's failure to weaken.
â There was early Weakness in the specialties on '
-. t'hi? injunction against the payment of dividends
of. ; Federal Steel stock, and on talk of strikes i
. â¢ :i street railway lines, but disclaimers of an '
â y-friifention to strike by labor leaders and the
.' Etfehgth of sugar, on the decline of raw sugars,
' ...betped this department, as did the strength of
â¢Anaconda. Consolidated Gas was strong on
â' talk of a settlement of the rate war. Interna
-. ttbnal paper and American Smelting weakened
â  â¢sharply in the late transactions. Bonds wore
Â; raoderately active and strong. In the ordinary
â â . course of events the operators in stocks and
J Securities are Influenced by the expected rather
; Â° than by present conditions. Except when some
. â BUacJen and unforeseen event Is precipitated,
i -the course of prices always reflects a forecast, i
-.- ami as far In the future as the operator is will
.â  Ing to rely on his. judgment to penetrate. Thus
â '-, the;- professional operators sold last week on
the well-grounded belief that the course of
â¢ -events would inevitably lead to a squeeze In
: money July 1. This week, though the expected
â : -event had not occurred, stock market operators
begun to look beyond to the period of abundant
money which will come with the disbursement
-.of July interests and dividends and have bought
i stacks in anticipation of that condition. Oper
at<jr& who sold short last week have also been
buying this week to cover their contracts and
- take, their profits, thus helping on th* rising
â¢ tendency. But the most Important influence of
." the .week was the strength of New York Cen
Â« tra), .corroborative as it was of the rumors of
J Impending" consolidations of Vanderbilt rail
â¢ road .interests.
o This' comes under the head of sudden and
â¢ unforeseen events, though the long continued
.â t flrmn-e.-s of New York Central at a price above
' a fair Investment value of 4 per cent has
5 clearly indicated faith by insiders of coming
favorable developments. The successful results
of the -merging of the I^ake Shore and the
Â» Michigan Central in.to the New York I Central
â¢ are already becoming apparent in higher effi
Â°. o ciency and lower operating expenses. The rail
roads In which the Vanderbllt holdings are in
fluential form so vast a ramification that com
prehensive plans of consolidation, such as W.
j K. Vanderbilt is said to favor, are no less fea
sible, considering the conditions and tendencies
of the times, than was the original through
line from New York to Chicago achieved by
Coi'.imodore Vanderbilt. The widespread be
lief that the present Vanderbilt interests con
template a transcontinental line from Boston
j to the Pacific was reflected this week by the
i sympathetic strength with New York Central,
of I'hlcazo and Northwestern, Omaha, Union
Pacific, Oregon Short Line securities and Ore
gon Navigation. The strength in New York
Central was the most Influential factor In in
ducing the buying of railroad stocks In anti
cipation of the rise which Wall-street traders
believe is sure to come after July 1. The much
improved condition of the country's crops and
the springing up of a cash demand for wheat
! and corn from domestic sources and also for
export have also been influences. The large
grain movement being added to the already
heavy freight movement of merchandise of all
; classes has brought the current railroad earn
i Ings' up to unprecedented figures.
The attitude of London toward American se
curities has been very favorable. Buying from
that source has been large during the week, and
has made sufficient sterling exchange to ef
fectually break the exchange market and pre
clude the likelihood of further shipments of
gold.
The Industrials generally have been in disfa
vor in the New York market during the week,
; and the movement in railroad stocks has sep
arated Itself from the industrials. Profit
taking was induced to some extent by the
stiffening of the money rate, but liquidation
; was not on a large scale, and the standard rail
road stocks ended near the highest.
There has been an enlarged business in bonds
and an advancing tendency in prices.
The total sales of stocks to-day amouted to

ASSOCIATED BANKS STATEMENT.
NEW YORK, July I.â The Financier says:
The statement of the Associated Banks for the
week ending July 1 shows some of the heaviest
changes in months, due not so much to unfa
vorable influences as to the operations of the
halt-yearly period. The three factors which I
have served to reduce the cash reserves by
nearly $11,500,000 are the gold exports, treasury
debts and the midsummer dividend period.
Under present conditions it may be said safely
that no mora gold will go to Europe unless
an exceedingly fancy rate Is paid for It. As
for th? treasury. It is known that for some
time past the banks have been losing steadily
to the Government, owing to the transfers of
deposits and the growing excess of customs
payments over disbursements. This is a very
satisfactory feature of the situation, showing
as It does a rieht to a period of normal busi
ness, but for the time being it is taking more
or less money out of circulation. Beginning
with July, however, the treasury will have
heavy payments in the way of bonded interest
and expenses to meet, and this will allow the
banks to recoup some of their previous losses.
In the same manner the Institutions will begin
to show the effect of the enormous July, dis
bursements, and while the crop season Is not
far distant, it 13 to be expected that the money
movement will continue this week for a time. I
An unusual incident has been the shipping of
gold from New York to the interior during the
past few days. Canada has also been drawing
gold. That the banks, in the face of the con
tinued drain upon their resource-, are able to
maintain their loans at the highest figure ever
known and still report $14,000,000 excess reserve,
is regarded as abundant proof of their strength.
How the statement will affect Interest rates
is not known, but since any material advance
is certain to result In a rush of Idle capital to
this center, a. stringency in the local market
is regarded as highly improbable. The current
statement shows that the larger banks, which
have been carrying the greater proportion of
surplus reserves, have lost heaviest, so that
the reduction does not mean that the banks
as a rule are at the limit of their loaning
power.

wheat were on the market, not only for the
cash article but for futures. There were also
renorts of damage to crops on the Continent.
reporting continued heavy rains, while the
weather was also reported in England as wet.
General conditions In Europe were said to be
favorable for a srood demand for American
wheat. The strong tone of foreign advices was
readily responded to by the local market, which
was well loaded down with short wheat, and
though domestic receipts were still heavy and
July deliveries larte, the bulls at once as
sumed the aggressive and retained the upper
hand throughout the short Saturday session.
Commission houses were good buyers, and re
ports of winter wheat threshings in general
were confirmatory of the claims of damage to
the crop. September sold as high as 7;>%c, and
closed at 75%<&75%c.
Corn was steady, but dull early. Sympathy
with wheat sustained prices In face of con
tinued large receipts and favorable weather.

WHEAT AND OTHER GRAINS.
.WHEATâ first day of the new crop year
opened with a better market all over the world.
The English demand was more active, and
' :â â  '.--.â â  â "_â â â 
prospects for prices were more encouraging.
Broomhall cabled that a decrease in cargoes
on passage was expected on Monday, and that
30s 6d is bid for California cargoes off coast.
New York reported that all cable offers- to
Continent Friday night were accepted. Chicago
reported that the July Wheat was all liqui
dated. Heavy rains in Texas, wet weather in
France and England, and a small and inferior
crop with bad weather at Budapest comprised
the bull news of the day. Missouri State report
placed the yield of the State at 9,100,000 bush
els, against 12,400.000 last year, an average of
9 bushels per. acre, with over 200,000 acres
plowed ud.
Under these encouraging conditions the local
market was very firm, with an advance in
futures.

Harrison's circular says: "During the pres
ent week there have been rour arrivals of coal
from Oregon, with 1515 tons; three from Wash
ington, 9765 tons; four from British Columbia,
15.911 tons; two from Australia, 4252 tons; total,
31.443 tons. If we had not received heavy ship
ments last week there would be a scarcity of
some grades in the jobbers' hands; as it is, but
little is accumulating in yard, the outlet being
somewhat greater than the deliveries. Prices
are steady, with an outlook of somewhat stiffer
values existing a little later, as coal carriers
are not plentiful in Australia, and this should
be the only source from which we are liable
to draw any low-priced fuel this year. Colonial
coals are finding a more profitable market at
the nitrate ports on the West Coast. Any fu
ture attempts to secure fairer prices for fuel
will be checked immediately by low-priced fuel
oil, which is now being produced in large
quantities in new sections throughout Cali
fornia. Our large fleet of locally owned coal
carrier? are scattering generally in foreign
ports, principally in Australian and Chinese
waters, hence coal freights from British Co
lumbia and Washington are ruling high, and
will remain so for several months. Ships art
good property locally pro tern., as they are all
flnling profitable employment, being eagerly
!"->UKht after to carry lumber and coal at full
figure--."

THE WICKED WITCH
AND POOR CHRISTINA
By M. Rene Mitchell.
IN olden times there lived a King
and Queen with their three daugh
ters. The eldest daughter was 16,
the next one was 13 and the young
est was 9 ye:.. old. They were
dearly beloved by both the King and
Queen.
And when fairies and witches were
upon the earth among them was an old
witch who was feared by all who knew
hr-r. This old witch had a daughter
who was feared also, because of her
ueriy manners. And so one day the old
witch dressed herself in a beautiful new
gown and changed her daughter into
;. beautiful rose for Christina, which
was the youngest of the Klne's daugh
ters, and the one she most envied.
And she went to the palace and went
to the door and knocked, and the Queen
came to the door and the witch said:
"I have a beautiful rose for Christina,
and may I see her?"
The Queen said, "Step in " and the
King and his daughters came in the
room and the witch gave the rose to
Christina to smell and very soon she
became very ugly and old like the
wjtrh"? own daughter. And when the
King and Queen found out the witch
did it they ordered her to be put in
prison, and the King told her that he
would have her put to death if she
would not tell him how to restore his
daughter. So threatened, the witch
told Christina to drink a certain kind
of wine and to bring her the rose.
Christina did as she was directed and
once more was beautiful. The witch
fled and never was seen again.
She hunted for her all through the
woods until they came to the meadow.
Bertha awoke when she heard them
calling her. When she saw that it was
dark she ran toward them crying, and
Zelma cried for joy to think she had
her safe once more in her arms. Zelma
eaid she would not leave her alone
again.

"Hint, toot," said the owl. "I have a friend, a beaver, who is the
best digger and builder in all the world and who knows more than
any one alive â almost as much, in fact, as my father used to know.
Call him."
So the heaver was called to tell what it would be best to do. He
looked at the Nidderdinks babies and was going: to tell them what h-=
could do, when they coaxed him so to play that he frisked through
the woods with th-^m for several hoursâ frisked until they were all
tired out and the darkness had come. The Nidderdinks babies looked
up into the trees and there saw s<>me shiny, round things staring
down at them from a tree limb. They were frightened a little, but
they were told by a voice that came from the neighborhood of the
shiny, round things that what they saw were only the eyes of the
owls. You know that the owls can see better by night than by day,
and that in fact, the owl does not open his eyes wide until it comes
night. Was it not lucky that the fairies had thought to have the
owls for watchmen for Xidderdinks Land? At regular times, all
through the night, the Xidderdinks babi.-s could hem the owls say
ing. "Hoot, toot." That was meant to tell the Nidderdinks that ail
was well and that no stranger was in their land to annoy or molest
them.

AN ADVENTURE IN
A REAL FAIRY DELL
By Lucy M. French.
ONCE there was a little Phepherd
boy who lived with an old herd
er, and every day he would go
out and take care of the sheep.
One day he was wandering along
very hungry and thirsty, when he
heard the sound of falling water. He
went and hunted for it and came Into
the loveliest little dell you could im
agine. There was a pond of clear crys
tal water. He knelt down and drank
until he had appealed his thirst, then
he lay down on the velvety grass.
!'â â  "looked around and snid to himself
"Surely, this must be some fairy dell,
for I have never seen anything half so
fairy-like before. I suppose the fairies
have balls and feasts here." He fell
asleep and dreamed that the fairies
had come and were having a ball, and
just then he awoke. He heard the
sounds of enchanting music, and on
looking round saw thousands of little
fairies dancing and laughing. They
beckoned to him to join them, but he
said he was too large. So one little fel
low went up to him and eaid:
"Drink this and you will grow small."
So he drank it and immediately grew
as small as his companion. He then
went and danced with the fairies and
had a fine time. He was sorry when it
was over, but promised to come again.
So the whole summer passed away so
delightfully for the little shepherd. One
day the fairies told him that they were
going to leave. He was very sorry and
they said next summer they would
come back, for the winters were too
cold for them. So they went away.
One little fairy gave him a diamond
ring, saying: "When you want any
thing turn it around three times and
wish." He was so sad that he never
thought about it. One day he was very
lonely and happened to glance at his
finger and saw the ring. He thought
of what the fairy had said and thought
he would try it, and said: "I wish the
winter would not be cold, so the fairies
could stay l.ere. No sooner had he said
it then all the fairies came dancing
along. They said: "Now that you
have wished it we 'will stay." So they
stayed and the little shepherd stayed
with them always and never had to
work any more and lived happily ever
after.

Dear Editor: I was 9 years old last
January. My friend Walter Brobeck and
So it went on the long night through. Sometimes an owl would
leave his sentry post in a tree to arrest some wandering bat who would
rap with his dusky wines at the door of a Nidderdlnks baby's house;
but not one owl flew out of Nidderdinks Land all the long night
through.
Every morning the beaver tried to tell the Nidderdinks babies
how he could make a passageway under the ground to join all the
little caves in which the Nidderdlnks babies lived, into one cave.
Every morning the Nidderdinks babies tried to be good and listen,
but Aldare was there. He it was who got them all into a frolic every
day. So the beaver would play with the children all the day and
again and again night would come and the caves were many and
were not joined into one. But. when the first rainy season came to
Nidderdinks Land and the babies were prisoners on account of the
wet much of the time, the good beaver went to work without saying
anything to the Nidderdinks and began to tunnel. His third cousins,
the squirrels, also began to work on another part of the plan he had
thought out between play times.
First the beaver made a wide and high dam so that the creek
would not flow through the Nidderdinks streets to drown the Nidder
dinks babies. Then he tunneled from on" little cave to another and
joined them all. At the same time the squirrels used their Fharp teeth
to gnaw through the trunks of the hollow trees that were used for
houses by the Nidderdinks and from the holes made by the squirrels
the beaver tunneled into the passageway between the caves. What a
lark the Nidderdinks had when this was done. I cannot begin to tell
you all about that.
Never mind. When I saw this street in Nidderdinks Land the
doors to the trees were all hidden by hushes and flowers and grass
so that a stranger would never guess that there were any doors in
all the forest. The bird? had brought the seeds and planted them,
and th>^ hushes and flowers had grown up into a thick screen more
beautiful and just as useful as the best Japanese screen that has ever
been made. The Nidderdinks people did net try to hide now. for, see
ing the Queen with me, they knew that I was their friend. Such tiny
little dishes there were in the Nidilt-rdinks houses â all made from
pieces of BWeet-smelling tree hark! Su^-h little rocking chairs and
other pieces of furniture â all made of small branches of the trees
that had been cut neatly <">ff by th.p paw like teeth of the squirrels
from the trees. There were dolls, too, real clever little dolls, with wal
nuts for head?, pome of them. All Nidderdinks Land came out to give
me welcome.
The baby elephant showed me what ho would do if there .should
he a fire in the woods to endanger Nidderdink? Land. He is, in fa^t,
the fire department of the Nidderdinks, the chief, the engineer and
all hands. The leathery little monster rolled on his funny legs to thÂ«^
creek and filled his trunk with water. Then he snorted comically, so
comically that he had t" laugh himself and so the water ran down his
throat and he was half choked before he caught his breath again. How
ever, he filled his trunk once more and then showered the bushes and
I don't think I like cats. "Cook" was
awfully good to me. She used to save
little pieces of meat and goodies for me
and I got so fat. I used to lie in the

it was so nice and round, people used
to speak of how fat I was. One day
what was my delight to see the family
return. I had grown quite a good deal
and felt proud when I stood up by the
children to think I could reach their
noses. I am afraid I was a little r oush,
because a few times when I was only

looked so hurt at me and said, "If you
hurt my haby I won't love you."
Now I loved the lady and I didn't

WHAT HAPPENED
TO A VERY BAD FLY
By Nellie U. O'Day.
ONCE upon a time there was a fly
who was always in somebody's
way. His mother was a gentle,
timid creature, who did not like
to go out of her house unless it
was necessary. She had ten children,
who were very obedient to her, except
this one. His name was Nibble. He
would go out every morning to hunt for
his breakfast instead of getting it at
home. He was so naughty that every
evening he would make his poor mother
chase him all around before he would
go in.
During the day, while his brothers
â  and sisters were at home enjoying
themselves, he was out stealing and
nibbling at something. When he'd
come home at night he would tell all
his troubles to his sisters and brothers,
but they would say nothing, as he was
bad to them. He was always getting
into a fight and trying to make people
uncomfortable. During the day he
would succeed, for when people would
have company he'd go buzzing around
them, Just to annoy them and â¢ make
them get cross.
One day when he was out quite early
In the morning he saw a pitcher with
molasses in it standing near a door,
and he said, "I'll have those molasses,
even if I die getting it." So he dipped
his nose in to get a smell, and it smelt
so good that he went In to get some.
After he got all he wanted he tried to
get out, but his legs were stuck to
gether and he could not move them. In
vain he tried and tried again, bo he
left off quite exhausted. In a little
while the lady came to get some mo
lasses for the breakfast, when she saw
the bad fly. So she took a spoon and
took the fly out and threw him in the
coal scuttle, and there he is lying dead
on account of all his disobedience and
naughtiness to other people.

so exciting. I felt real proud, but
somehow every one does not look on
sport in the same light â for the man
who feeds the chickens said some real
mean things to me about it. I .lust
guess he felt bad because he wanted
to catch that chicken himself, and I
spoiled his fun.

life. I don't know how it happened,
hut I got under the wheels of a wagon
and they went over me. I screamed

it was something awful. I never

THE ACORN THAT
LEARNED TO TALK
By Jeanette Williamson.
DEAR me, here I am on this beau
tiful day with all my little
brothers and sisters all dressed
in beautiful brown dresses, with
caps of green. Our home is
along a brook which runs and laughs
by us all day long. I am happy, for I
tan see the running water and hear
the birds sing all 'lay long, and at night
when the birds cro to their little nests
the beautiful loaves curl around us and
keep us warm.
But what is that coming down the
hill? Oh, dear, they are dreadful-lock
ing people with tar on their heads and
baskets and baps in their hands and I
wonder what they want? Here. I will
just hide in under this leaf and see
what they want here. They stopped in
front of our home and began to talk.
Some of them go away and two old
Indian women opened bags and put
their hands out and plucked my little
brothers and sisters until they were
all gone but me. They do not see me.
but then when I look at our home and
see that all are gone but poor little me
I regret then they did not see me.
One of the old Indians got up to get
a drink and saw me and put me into
that dirty-looking sack, where I find
my little* brothers and sisters crying
and wondering what will become of us
when they all get their hags and
baskets full. They take us home and
pour us out on the ground. I rolled
under a rock. Then they took two rocks
and put us between them and crack us
open. They take off those pretty brown
dresses nd green caps and throw them
away. Then I see them all robed in
white Then I know they are all dead,
and I think now they will be buried.
No. a worse fate is theirs. They are
put in a big stone dish and the women
take hammers and grind them all fine.
Then they mix them with water and
then make bread and cakes to eat, and
I am glad they do not see me, for I

trees, even ducking an owl, who sat solemnly dozing in the shadow of
a manzanita bush.
"Do it again."' said a mischievous Nidderdinks to the elephant, as
the solemn owl shook his feathers and tried to get rid of the water.
But the owl flapped his wings heavily and fled to a high tree, from
Which he looked down at a safe distance upon the scene.
Hark! What was that coming through the woodn? It was the
hippopotamus! Was it? No. There was the old hippopotamus cooling
off in the creek, with only his head above the water, his huge body
being deep in the cool stream. But surely there was a four-legged
animal of some description moving along and coming in our direction.
Behold it was a giraffe, and upon its back Aldare was riding. On
came thr giraffe and its rider with the speed of a whirlwind.
Aldare reined in like a veteran circus rider. What had he strung
around the long neck and tied to the tail of the giraffe? I caught
the look in the lad's eyes and made no sign. The Nidderdinks looked
curiously at what seemed to them to be strings of ornaments, all red.
"Aldare," I began.
"Sh-sh." was his response.
The giraffe was vain of his necklace and the ornaments on his
tail. Ail the Nidderdinks babies looked on admiringly.
Aldare disappeared and then came back with something that he
held behind him. He stole up behind the giraffe. Suddenly there
was a sputtering sound. Smoke and fire seemed to be coming from
the giraffe's tail.
Pop. pop, pop. crack, crack, cr-r-r-r-ackkkkkkkkk, popcrack, slam
bang, slapity-bang, wheel
The giraffe was off again like the wind, leaving a train of smoke
that smelled of powder and a string of torn and scorched paper on the
ground to mark out the way he had fled. So it was that Aldare intro
duced the idea of a Fourth of July celebration into Nidd^rdinks
Landâ for the ornaments on the giraffe were strings of fire-crackers
and the lowest ornament on the giraffe's tail was a big, red Chinese
bomb.
We heard the giraffe scurrying away through the woods. Boom!
The bomb went off with a noise like a cannon. Splash! The giraffe
leaped into the creek and all the celebration was ended as suddenly
as it had begun. The bear cubs looked very mischievous. They were
the ones who had brought the fire-crackers to Aldare.
"Well," said the Queen, "I never." D. H. W.

I felt so bad I couldn't eat, and
then they said, "He is sick; give

me â oil, black medicine. Oh! the stuff
they poured down my throat â some of
it got on my hair. I didn't look very
pretty. I crawled up in the top of the
barn -and curled up in a little corner
of the hay. I don't know how many
days I stayed there, for I was so ill
I didn't keep track of the days;
couldn't eat â the pain in my insides
from being run over and everything.
Well, I felt pretty miserable and
thought a dog's life wan not the nleas

a cat being run over. One day I heard
somebody coming up the stairs: it was

THE PRESCRIPTION
WRITTEN ON A DOOR
By Alice M. JacKson.
IT was in the month of December.
1898, snow was falling very fast
and all outside was clothed in
about a foot of white, feathery
snow. The snow birds were twit
tering on each snow-covered bough.
Dr. Dorroh was sitting in his office
by a nice hot fire reading, when a
telegram came for him to come to Gar
diner's Hotel as soon as possible. He
went home to get his horse and buggy
ready. When he got home his horse
had been taken out by Mrs. Dorroh,
who had gone for a ride He then went
to Tryon's stable and got a horse that
had just been brought back from Val
lecito by George Stickle.
Dr. Dorroh started at just half-past
2 o'clock in the afternoon. He was half
way between Murphys and Angels
when the snowstorm started afresh,
and as the horse was tired he did not
wish to go any farther, but at last,
when the storm had subsided, ho start
ed off. But what was the use of his
starting at all? For he had not gone
ten feet, when in turning a corner they
ran into a two-horse team coming from
Murphys. Dr. Dorroh's horse broke
one of its fore legs and one horse in the
team from Murphys sprained a leg. The
other horse was unharmed.
The man in the team from Murphys
took the lame horse out of the road
and hitched the horse that was un
harmed into Dr. Dorroh's buggy, and
the doctor and himself went to Gardi
ner's. When they arrived the doctor
went in the room where the sick man
was. he felt his pulse and told him that
he had the typhoid fever. He then tried
to find a piece of paper to write a pre
scription on. But he could not and
any, so he went outside and found a
piece of charcoal and wrote the pre
scription on the door. He then went
home and said he would call again
A friend of the man's came, but he
could not read. So he took the door off
the hinges and carried it to the drug
gist in Murphys and had the prescrip
tion filled. He then returned in the
enow, and when he got back was nearly
frozen. The man got well

STRANGE HAPPENING
TO A PAINTED KITTEN
By Charlie Betts.
THERE was once a little girl who
painted a kitten on a board and
it was so real that she had
hardly painted the tip of its tail,
which was the last of all. as it
ought to be. when the kitten be
gan to purr. "Take your little pen
knife that your papa gave you at
Christmas time and cut me out of this
board," whimpered the kitten.
So the little girl took her Christmas
penknife and whittled and whittled un
til her hands were blistered, and still
she <lid not seem to get ahead any.
The kitten was just as ..iuch a prisoner
as it had been before she began to
whittle. It cried pitifully
Now the pile of whittlings grew big
ger and bigger and the tears of the
wooden kit. n. flowing steadily, made
them all swell. They swelled up bo
that, before the little girl knew it., the.
whittlings had blocked up the door
way.
The little girl was crowded into a
corner by the swelling pile of whittling.
Then, hardly knowing what was best to
do, she crawled into the pantry and
shut the door. *~rettv soon she heard
the kitten crying for milk. There was
milk enough in the pantry and the lit
tle girl could not bear to think that the
kitten she had made was hungry. She
opened the pantry door a little.
In ran the kitten and the penknlf 3
came cantering after. But the little
girl was too quick for the naughty
knife. She shut the door, but not un
til the knife had cut the poor kitten's

QUEER TRICKS OF ODD FAKERS.
(if all odd occupations a middle-aged,
keen-witted Irishman named Dowling
has perhaps the oddest. His husi:
heart disease, and it yields him a com
fortable living. When he is hungry, or
: cold, or in need of a bath or a hair cut
he simply has an attack and falls in a
heap on some convenient street corner.
A policeman sends in a hurry call, an
ambulance dashes up and Dowling is
â  soon lying in a cool hospital cot and
sucking broth through a straw. Some
â time he is so weak that he needs a
glass <-f Invigorating port win- to brace
him up. Not long ago he had such a
successful tit that a clergyman gave
him a blessing and sent aim to the hos
pital apparently in a dying condition.
â¢Of late he has been complaining of hard
; times. The police have come to know
him, and sometimes they do not appre
ciate his enterprise,
Dowling is typical of a class of men
and women who love hospital life and
â¢who actually enjoy being operated
â¢ upon.
"We have them every day or two,"
said- one of the oldest registrars of
Uellevue Hospital. "We could fill the

Rev. Dr. Baker of St. Luke's Hos

favor of Miss Magill, who turned for home

"pnir')liss Hezlet began her golf work!
at the age of 11. Her family were all ;
golfers and she learned from them the
best methods. They took turns in teach- |
j,,.. her; so she borrowed nerve from the
â¢ boys and perseverance from the
â  women. She first distinguished

gradually that skill which serves her

tution suffering apparently from a
small swelling which was diagnosed as
a tuni"]-. Sly occupied a bed in a ward
for some time while various means for
the reduction of the lump were prac
ticed. Finally it was decided to ope
rate and the patient was under ether.
When the doctors leaned forward to
make the first incision, lo! and behold
the turner was gun*-. They thought
this rather curious and decided to post
pone the operation. When the woman
was allowed ' revive and was ques
tioned she stoutly maintained that she
had the tumor and pointed to it in
proof. Sure enough it was there. She
was put under the influence of ether
again, but this time the swelling was
watched, and as the drug began to take
effect it was seen slowly to recede. The
patient was therefore put back to bed
and the hospital authorities attempted
to look up her antecedents. After some
research it was found that she was
known in nearly every hospital in Lon
don and to a few in New York. She
could raise the lump at will merely by
exercising certain muscles, and she got
her living by the imposition on hos
pital authorities.
A man mentioned by Dr. Baker was
admitted to the hospital because he
complained of ;i terrible pain in his left
foot. Finally the pain became so great,
as he claimed, that at his request it
was decided to amputate one of his
toes. The operation laid him up for
some time, but when he was convalces
elng the toe next to the one just taken
oft" began to pain. In the course of
time the second toe was amputated,
and later on other toes were taken off.
Finally the doctors were compelled to
call a halt, as manifestly the man was
losing his toes intentionally for the
sake of an otherwise easy living In the
hospital.
As soon as the subject was mentioned
to House Physician Maloney of St. Vin
cent's Hospital he referred immediately
'.'â  Robert McMahon as the king- of ma
lingerers. He said the man had a de
pression in the back of the skull, evi
dently the result of an operation, and
well calculated to tool ambulance sur
geons who do not know M:-MahoiÂ».
After speaking of McMahon's well
known ability to withstand ordinary
surgical tests. Dr. Maloney said:
â¢'I once ran across a* fellow who
eclipsed McMahon in his ability to
stand all tests, except one. I remem
ber I was called in a hurry to Bleecker
street, where a man had been found
unconscious. When the ambulance
reached the call point I found a group
of passersby and a policeman gazing
down at a man lying on the sidewalk.
The bluecoat said the man was dead.

and aftfr applying various tests I con
cluded he was. He did not breathe, nor
did he respond to pressure on the su
perorbital nerve. Pressing on this
nerve, which is located just under the
eyebrow, is the last and final test
used by ambulance surgeons for deteci-
Lng whether or not a person is sham
ming unconsciousness. Finally I
thought I would resort to one more test
before I turned the body over to the
Coroner. I had with me a bottle of
very strong aqua ammonia. I held it
uncorked under the man's nose, while
the crowd wondered who he was, how
he died and what his family would do.
At the end of five minutes the "corpse '
suddenly arose and hurried down the
street. The crowd looked on it as a
kind of miracle, and the policeman was
too dazed to arrest the fellow. He must
have been on the ground over half an
hour. How he kept so quiet all that
time and had the nerve to resist the
other tests I made on him has always
seemed wonderful to me.
"There was another fellow who w.ts
admitted to this hospital suffering with
i stomach trouble, so he said, and his de
scription of the general symptoms if a
certain disease was so accurate that it
was decided to operate on him. He ivas
put under ether and cut open and ex
amined, only to be found quite healthy.
It took him some time to get well, and ,
things went easily with him meanwhile.
When the cut had almost healed he be
gan complaining again, and in the ond
a second operation was performed, with
no other result than to insure him a bod |
and board for a month or more. We j
found that man had a record. He was 1
well read in the symptoms of diseases. |

He knew just how to act in order to
give the impression of suffering. He
had been operated on a number of
times, and always in a manner to lay
him up for various periods of time. Did
it hurt him? No. The anesthetic dead
ened the pain. He knew that as well as
we did. He simply wanted to live in a
hospital and be waited upon. In fact, it
is curious to find how many people
there are who have a mania for being
operated upon. We have some women
who almost beg us to cut them open,
when really there is no necessity for it.
Some of them doubtless believe they
need the cutting. I believe much of this
desire for treatment comes from illy
digested reading of medical works."

College relates the following story of
a woman's ability to withstand pain.
"Once," he says, "I received a hurry
call to attend an unconscious woman
who had been brought into a police sta
tion. I was just graduated from college.
So, for fear of exposing my undue zeal,
I resolved to make some very severe
tests on the woman when I found her.
She manifestly belonged to the lower
half of society. I thought she might be
j shamming unconsciousness.
â¢'I rapped the soles of her feet. She
did not seem to mind it. I jammed a
pin into her arm muscles â and sud
, denly, too, but she did not wince. Fin
ally I pressed my finger nail hard on
the superorbital nerve. It never
pheased her. Then I concluded that her
case was serious and I rushed her off to
the hospital. When we got there one of
the regular ambulance men looked at
the woman on the stretcher, laughtd
and said: 'I say, Stone, what have you

tests I had applied. 'Serious, nothing.'
he said. Then he walked up to the
woman and said, "Now, look here. Mag,
you can't fool me! Get up out of there
and get out! Go along, now?' To my
great surprise the woman did get up
and cursed him roundly for informing
on her. She had fooled that surgeon
once, just as she had fooled every new
man. But her ability to withstand the
pain I must have caused her astonished
me."
Dr. David T. Marshall of Gouveneur
Hospital relates how the house physi
cian of one of the City Island hospitals
pot rid of a man who feigned paralysis
of the legs. The man affirmed that he
could not walk, and lay apparently
helpless, at the mercy of a tremendous
appetite. One summer's day when the
man had to be wheeled out on a
veranda, the physician rigged up a
hose at the foot of the paralytic's bed.
fixing the nozzle in such a manner that
a stream of water from the hose would
strike the man near the neck. That
night, while the patient was asleep, the
faucet connecting with the hose was
turned on. Several doctors were in the
office awaiting developments. Almost
instantly the yells of the man awakened
nearly every one in the hospital, and in
a moment he was jumping downstairs
three steps at a time. He made a great
outcry, but the authorities did not have
to persuade him to leave. He went of
his own accord and nothing but a
padded cell could have held htm back.
In the Presbyterian Hospital they tell

every Thanksgiving eve. She lived in
Eighty-seventh street, and for years
the ambulance surgeon of the hospital
would wait for that call. It always
came without fail the day before
Thanksgiving. Nothing ever was found
to be the matter with this woman, nor
could the hospital authorities ever find
out why she made her periodical visits.
The pet remembrance of the Mt. Sinai
Hospital doctors is of a woman who
avowed she could not walk. She stayed
some weeks in the institution and the
physicians knew she was feigning sick
ness yet they could not make her stand
on her legs. Finally the head physician
said one day to his assistant in front of
her, "Now, to-day we will give this pa
tient electricity. Start on a small cur
rent. If it is not strong enough give her
more until it is, and apply it to the
soles of the feet. She wiil walk. I
think!" A faradic current was usad I
and a metal brush electrode was ap
plied to her feet. The current coniincr
from every strand in that brush was i
like the pricks of so many hot ne-'dles. j
The woman stood the torture for about
one minute. Then she hopped out of
bed and fairly danced up and down |
with rage, while she heaped curses on I
the heads of her persecutors. She I
donned her clothes and left the house. ;
It Is said that Irish girls have the best
eyes, the keenest wit, the brightest com
plexion and the most beautiful hands of
all the women in the world, the hands of
the American girls being declared too
narrow and too long, those of the Eng
lish girls too plump, German girls' hands
too broad and fat, while the Spanish fem
inine hand Is the least graceful of all.
/UiJvISJHOUSE FOft ANIMALS.
There are no persons in the world
who are more tender toward domestic
animals than the Buddhists. For cen
turies the Hindoos have taken the ut
most care of all the animals that ever
came into their possession, and to-tlay
the visitor to India may see many hos
i pitals and asylums in which sick and
! aged animals are carefully tended. The
| largest of these homes for needy ani
mals is at Sodepur, near Calcutta. At
; present it contains 960 inmates â namely,
! 129 oxen, 307 cows, 171 calves, 72 horses,
| 69 sheep, l. r > goats, 141 doves, 4 hens, 4
1 cats, 3 monkeys and 5 dogs. The cows
, are treated the best of all, for the rea
son that they are regarded in India as
sacred animals.
Justin Huntly B Carthy, who has been
lecturing in the States on Omar Kayyam,
told a friend the other day that after a
lecture in Brooklyn a member of the audi
ence thanked \.>m lor his exposition, and
added: "I never before Knew the differ
ence between Omar Kayyari and Hunyadi
Janos."
