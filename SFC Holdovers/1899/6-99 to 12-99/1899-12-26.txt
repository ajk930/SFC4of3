EARTHQUAKE USHERS
IN THE CHRISTMAS
Southern California Towns Get a
Severe Shaking, and Near San Ja
cinto Six Squaws Are Killed.
LOS ANGELES, Dec. 25.â
Dame Nature gave South
ern California an unwel
come Christmas present to-day.
At 4:30 o'clock, just before the
dawn of the gladsome holiday,
the entire lower portion of the
Mate was shaken by a tremen
dous earthquake. The undula
tions lasted about twelve seconds.
The center of the shock appears
to have been at San Jacinto, a
small town in Riverside County.
The business portion of San Ja
cinto consists of two blocks of
stpry buildings, some of
which are built of brick. Ten or
fifteen buildings wore damaged,
chimneys being toppled nvcr and
the walls cracked and shaken.
The total damage at San Jacinto
and Eienu :. a small town nearby.
estimated at $50,000. The
large tourist hotel at Hemet was
damaged and the hospital at San
Jacinto suffered. The rear wall of
the Johnson block at Hemet fell.
The only loss of life so far as
, known was at the Saboba Indian
reservation, where six squaws
were killed by killing walls.
The shock was heavy at Santa '
Ana. Anaheim. San Bernardino,
Riverside and other places, but
un particular damage is reported,
except from San Jacinto and
Hemet.
i
In this city no damage was
done, though the shock was par- ,
ticularly violent. The hotels here
are well tilled with Eastern tour
ists, and they were in many in
stances terrified at the unexpect
ed disturbance and rushed irom
their rooms in a fright. It was at
first reported that the tower of!
the City Hall was badly dam- 1
aged, but an inspection to-day
failed to reveal any injury except
that done during an earthquake
which visited this section about
six months ago.

morning occurred a terrific earthquake

CHRISTIAN BROTHERS
MAY SOON SECEDE

in this city. The news appears rather discouraging tÂ«> frw
of the Brothers, for according to it the authorities in Rome arc
expected to decide against them. The Rome correspondent oi
the Freeman's Journal sends word that Archbishop Riordan ol
San Francisco is in Rome working in the interests of I
tliers. He has presented a voluminous report to the autfc
tics. It is understood he appears in Koine as the representative
of the American hierarchy, nearly all the bishops of this country
beintf on the side of the Christian HnÂ»t:
Referring tÂ«Â» the mission <Â«r Archbishop Riordan, the corre
spondent says he is informed it i- utterly vain. This statement
is regarded in Catholic circles here as a warning thai Rome is
going to decide against the Brothers. Some advocate! <>f the
Brothers' cause go so far as to say that in the event ol X
deciding against them the only thing for the Brothers to do
will l>e to withdraw fmm the French order and establish an
American community. This is said to be feasible, since all
all the American bishops are <Â»n their side.
The controversy between the American Christian Brothers
and their superiors has I considerable bitter feelin
the Catholic world, h has been charged thai the French it
riors have been actuated 1 y jealousy of the advancement and
prosperity of the order in this country. European Catholics who
have opposed the so-called Americanizing of the Catholic
Church in the United States taken the side of the French
Brothers in this conflict, and so the case 1 mcd interna

things being equal we ought to defeat the Berkeley team by a good score "

half. It was known that they possessed
great recuperative powers and it was in
the nature of things to expect that Cali

Urn mv,!K'-s to srore, although they were

minutes of the time alloted to the half.
Still II lutlfully If It
was not successful in gaining ground.
The Indians set out early to score and
many times were so dangerously near it
that the crowd held its breath and waited
for the grand coup and the savage yell
that announced the lifting of the first
scalp. Again and again the two teams
came together with heavy thuds, falling
in heaps, and after almost every scrim
mage each side had groaning men on the
ground.
It was one of the hardest games thÂ»
ward* of the Government had ever been
against and they* showed it early in the
half by getting, together and holding a
powwow in the center of the field. What
medicine they concocted will never be
known and did not affect the score, al
though it undoubtedly caused a great
many sore spots on the anatomy of Cali
fornia and caused a little later the retire
ment of Smith. The doughty right half
had to be injured twice before he would
consent to retire from the play. More
.took his place. Clay, the left tackle, who
was against Wheelock. the captain of the
bucks, was almost knocked out, but
stayed with the game.
Tlif Indians, a few mlnutqs after Cali
fornia bad loin Smith, were compelled to
r.tir.- the phenomenal Hudson, who had
:â¢â¢ bruising at the hands
Of the Herkt-K-yites. Roberts took his
place.
Half a dozen times in the last fifteen
minutes the Indians were so dangerously
close to a goal that it seemed that they
could kick it without trouble. Things
looked blue for their opponents, but they
buckled to and did not fall, and with the
ball In the hands of tho redskins on their
30-yard line, the whistle blew and the
gamÂ© was over, the Indians having failed
to add to the fruits of California's first
fumble.

was rung, and that was the closest to a
touchdown the blue and gold were at any
time during the game.
The time was font ebbing away and
fpet'dy. lightning work on cither Bide had
10 bÂ«Â« don>' In order to earn a score. Then
it was that the Indians uncovered their
speed. Like streaks of red they forged
Â«iown the Held five yards at a time until
they set their tracks on California's thlr
ty-nve-yard line, and here the university
men made an Intrepid stand. Time was
Heeling, so the signal was given for Hud
son to tr>" a drop kick for goal. He tried,
but that famous little field-goal kicker
misled his mark, and the only chance to
c^ort* that half had evanesced. From tho
!lftÂ«Â»en-yard lino California punted to thÂ«
center and the whistle cut *hort the first

Second Half.
Fierce, dopffed and muscle tearing had
l>Â«Â»cn tho work of the first half for both
elevens. California, with Its men trained
none too well, had gone Into the battle
find played grittily without a moments
rÂ«st. So had â ie Indians, for there was
no let up, no moments of light work for
cither team. Sever was a rest more hun
frrrc-d after than that between the halves.
and never did it produce such wholesome
results. '
The blue and gold lined up on the center
with more heart than when they took
their positions an hour before. They
realized how strong they were la defense,
and at the â¢ t." time did not undervalue
the strength of the opposition, Carlisle
wai< more or leas dumf<Â»unded st the won
derful vigor of a team they had been
]â¢ d to believe to bÂ© weak compared with
Karicrn standards, but the resolution of
\hÂ» Indiana did not palÂ© on this account.
All recognized .it once that thÂ« second

hair would bo a struggle to the doatli, and
lh.it endurance would be Us measure.
California kicked off to the Indians'
25-yard line. The blue and gold wns cer
tainly not dead, for the Indian advanca
was checked right Â«herÂ«. and \VI. eloclc
was again forced to punt, and the ball
went to the blue and gold In the center:
but In the next play Hall fumbled, and
on Indian assimilated the. pigskin. Hut
the Indians' phalanx opposition brought
no gain with it. and again the safe-mak
ing punt was resorted to.
California was equally unsuccessful In
offensive play, and Kaarsberg punted to
Hudson. Again California's defense stuck
like glue, and Hudson took another
chance at a field goal, but was far off the
mark.
So the game went, most of it In Califor
nia territory, the Indians making alow
short gains and then being checked In
their advance by the stiffening of Califor
nia's rushers. The ball oscillated back
and forth IlkÂ© a huge pendulum, llrst on
MM side of the fleld. then the other A
splendid run by Kaarsberg and Smith on
a double pass. Just as Kaarsberg was
tackled, brought out shouts and echoes
from the stands, but it was of no avail
and Kaarsberg was obliged to punt again
and the ball was Indian on the Cali
fornia fifty-yard line. Metoxen, buck-
Ing fullback, known all ever the East as
a marvel of line-damaging propensities,
was brought Into the play, and he gained
where no other man could, but even h<Â»
was stopped and held up short whenever
California was injected with grU and
ginger. On a forced punt by Wheclock
the ball rolled over thÂ« California goal
line and was = punted back to the center
from the twenty-ttve-yard -line, only to
fall Into the hands of Hudson, who with
good Interference shot through a pack of
blue and gold shirts for twenty yards.
It was now the Indians' ball and the
distance which separated them from Cali
fornia' goal posts was not more than
thlrty-llvo yards. Metoxen dashed through
the lino for live yards and again for three
yards. Then the Indians began attempt
ing some trick work In double passes, but
the local men were on the alert and noth
ing came of it, so punting was resorted to.
Backward and forward the ball moved in

[ tho Indian territory. Every time that a
â¢ ouchdown seemed Imminent for the In
1 â¢.lans California would -spread glue all
over Itself and hold fast as nails. Smith
j was being used up in the fierce work
i forced upon him. but he refused to quit
' the field. Gamely and with determination
the Indians would fight their way from
tho center of the field to the California
thirty and twenty yard lines, but no fur
: ther could they go. All their tactics, all
their stratagem was utilized. Tho Indian
team would shoot over to one side of the
ball and with a tandem Interference they I
i would advance, only to be repulsed at the I
: end. Grilling as the work was. Califor- 1
nia's men stood the brunt of battle, but I
Smith, with weakened ankle, had to be
packed off the field. He was replaced by
Moore, whose punting excelled that of
Kaarsberg. Soon after little Hudson was
carried off the Held amid the cheering of
every man, woman and child on the
j bleachers.
And so the battle waged, nothing ap
proaching it ever having, been seen on
! this cpast. After three successive but
j checked attempts at California's s*oal. the
I Indians secured the boll ' at the center.
Captain Wheelock realized that little
â  could be done unless it were done fast
and he Inspired his men this time. Right
through the center dashed Metoxen for
ten yards and the Indians lined up almost
tho moment he was downed. The tandem
: shoot netted live yards on the right side
of the line, and Metoxen again lessened
the distance. Seneca went at it. "Hold
hold. California," but California did not
hold. To the 20-yard line the red men had
made their ground and clouds began to
rather over the blue and gold bleachers.
Just then i Referee Goodwin blew nis
whistle long and loud. The game of East
and West was over with honors evenly
divided, though Carlisle is labeled the
victor. The teams lined up:

GOSSIP OF THE GAME.
Immediately after the game the mem
bers of the Carlisle team went to their
1 rooms at. the Palace.- The men were tired
from their exertions and many had sore
spots. Nearly every one of the redskins
complained . of the softness of the field
and the largeness of the ball. They
dubbed the pigskin the "California pump
kin" and claimed it caused the many fum
bles which occurred on their side.
MANAGER THOMPSON of the Indiana
was rather put out over the result of the
game. Ha- .-uid he would be willing to bet
his ;â¢*â¢â â ,.â * salary that the Indians could
defeat tho California team by a score of
40 to 0 i>u a. t^rder Held.
COACH WARNER thought that the
long railroad Journey had something to do
with the showing made by the Carllsles.
lie also complained that the Held was too
soft and retarded the Indians' work. He
spoku highly of the California team and
tnought Its standard of playing was on a
par with the best Eastern teams.
The members of the California team
took off the evidences of a hard battle at
tho Grand Hotel. They wero a jubilant
lot of players despite physical soreness.
Pringle and Smith were put to bed on ar
riving at the hotel, but Â«lid not stay long
under cover. Prlngle's right too bothered
him considerably, and to relieve the pain
he had one of his fellow players take a
sharft, knife and bore into the nail for the
purpose of letting out the blood. He
showed as much grit during the painful
operation as he has done during his whole
football career.
AL LEAN, the team's trainer, was as
happy as a lark. He flitted around the
men administering to their wants, patting
them on the back for their good work and
acting like a man who felt satisfied." He
said that the men wont into the game in
ns good condition as on Thanksgiving day
Ho thinks that the week's rest was bene
ficial to the eleven; that they went into
the game . stronger and played with
greater vim than ever before. He said It
taught him that too much work shows on
a team, and in. future: he will see that
players are given more rest. He half re
gretfully stated that yesterday's contest
severed his connection with the Berkeley
team . . : â .;:_,.â¢<â¢;â  ;-v.--
BENJAMIX IDE WHEELER, president
of the University of California, was much
pleased with the showing made by the
representatives of the university. He said
that at the close of the Stanford-Berkeley
game Thanksgiving day he came to the
conclusion that the standard of play in
vogue here was a? good us in the East.
He thought both teams put up fine foot
ball In yesterday's game, and was much
pleased with the gentlemanly way all con
cerned played the game. He to!d of a con
versation he had with Coach Warner, dur
ing which the latter said that California
would rank with the best teams of the
East.
GARRT COCHRA2C waa non-commlt-
tal. All he would say wa* that both
teams put up good football, and that the
Indlans would not have scored but for Hie
mistakes In signals In the first half. He

FRENCH COAL MINERS
WILL GO ON STRIKE
Movement That May Result in a
Walkout of Fifty Thousand
Men.
PARIS. Dec. 23.â At a meeting of 2300
miners held to-day in St. BtleniM a reso
lution was adopted in favor of declaring
a general strike In the coal basin of the
Loire to-morrow. A similar movement
involving 50,000 men is feared. The pros
perity of the coal trade led the miners to
demand an increase in wages, shorter
hours and a formal recognition of the
Miners' Federation by the companies. The
latter made an offer of 5 per cent Increase
but this was refused. To-day's decision
was reached amid cries of "Vive la
Grieve."
Disorders are expected. Already there
have been slight disturbances, particu
larly last evening, when the miners went
in procession through the streets of St.
Etienne singing the "Carmagnoje."
Twelve thousand five hundred Ince
workers are on strike at St. Etionne for
higher wagfs. Their Idleness Involves
that of 25.000 other dependent workmen,
making, with the miners, if the coal strike
Hpreads as is expected, nearly 100,000.
Moreover, a number of factories and
works will soon be compelled <to close,
owing to the coal shortage.

HOWEVER, THOUSANDS YET

Â»
As a Result of the Recent Cyclones

sities.
Pperia! Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON', Dec. 25.â Tho War De
partment made public to-day a statement
showing the progress made In relief work
In the Island of Porto Rico between Sep
tember 25 and November 30, 1599. The
population of the Island Is estimated at
918.920. The average dally indigent was
221,087 persons; average weekly sick. 17,372,
an.l the average weekly deaths 632 per
sons. The annual death rate was 35 per
thousand inhabitants, while the normal
rate was 2G to 1000 inhabitants. The in
creased mortality was conlined to the
mountain districts, where in somo locali
ties the death rate increased 300 per cent.
The amount of cash received for the re
lief of the suffering people of the island
up to November 30 was $15,224. The
amount of money disbursed up to tho date
mentioned was $7457.
Up to November 30 the total amount of
food received to relieve the sufferers was
17.1C2.738 pounds. Of this amount 16.545.316
pounds had been issued up to November
10. The amount of unissued food on hand
at San Juan November 30 waa 611,
pounds.
it was some weeks after the hurricane
before the mental and physical energies
of the stricken people began to rally from
the shock of the disaster. They were
without ready money and were brought
face to face with starvation. While the
damage inflicted upon the peoplo along
the coast of the island was very great,
it was in part offset by the Improvement
in the. sugar cane crop, which improve
ment was the result ox the overflow of
water on the. cane land. The crop en
abled the planters to borrow money with
which to employ the necessary labor to
care for and harvest tho crop. The cities
along the coast were also able to come to
the rescue by the employment of labor
to repair the damage Inflicted by the
storm, in consequence of these facts
supplies have gradually been suspended
in the lowlands, except in limited quan
tities to the chronic poor. The coffee
plantations are located in the uplands,
Here the high winds swept everything in
their course, leaving little or nothing for
the thousands of hungry. homeless,
clotbesless human beings but their lives
and what could be given them to prevent
starvation. The prompt action of the
Americans and the people of tho island
was all that prevented a terrible catas
trophe. The poor were fed and their live*
were preserved. Although a large part
of the island is no longer in danger, the
number of indigent remains large. It is
believed that until February next tho de
mand for assistance Is likely to Increase
In the mountain districts, as the planta-f
tlons and bananas will not be rfpo for
two months to come. The greatest dis
tress prevails in a locality where the
greatest difficulty Is found in getting food
to the starving.
The worst area contains a population of
about 250,000, and not a wagon road Is to
be found in any direction over which food
can bo transported. All food is carried on
the backs of horses. Of this population
200,000 people must be fed or -they will
starve. If not fed at home they will mi
grate to the cities, leaving the weak to
die. Their work will be left undone and
their future will bo hopeless.
Pestilence, which frequently follows
flood and famine, has appeared among the
unfortunate inhabitants in the mountain
districts, and a number of peopli have
perished. It la feared that the epidem.c
will spread to the coasts, and there will
be a movement from the mountains in
that direction. A move of this kind has
already been anticipated and Is being
Strictly controlled. Hut the relief must be
continued freely in the mountain districts
for all of December and January and dur
ing the greater part of February. .
It la estimated that not less than 20<XI ad
ditional tons of food will be required.
Four-sevenths should be beans, and the
remainder of the amount required should
be either codfish or bacon. With the
food already issued and now on hand, and
with the -â â 'â ' tons required in addition to
that already issued, the total issue will be.
20.1C2.758 pounds.
In dealing with the Indigent, able-bodied
men have been required to work for the
food they received, and a great deal of
public work has been done in the way of
cleaning towns, repairing roads, etc. A
plan has been devised between tho board
of charities and the needy planters and
their servants by which the. board fur
nishes food to the planters for the num
ber of servants In their families. in re
turn for this aid the planters sign an
agreement to furnish a small parcel of
land and a house to each family, which
land they are to see prepared and seeded
with food plants. The planters are also
to Bee that the laborers and their fami
lies are supplied with the food issued, and
that tho laborer performs a full days
work In return. The planters further
agree to furnish transportation of the
food.
BELASCO'S COMEDY
SCORES A SUCCESS
Auspicious First Production of
"Naughty Anthony" in a
Washington Theater.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 25.â David Belasco
â cored a success to-night In a new line
of work as a playwright, coming out as
a producer of comedy instead of a maker
of highly dramatic plays. "Naughty
Anthony, the name of his new produc
tion. Is far removed in style and theme
from "The Heart of Maryland" and
"Zasa." Its first presentation was given
at the Columbia Theater in this city to
night, and at iiÂ« close the audience, which
filled the house, gave the playwright an
ovation, while at the end of the second act
It insisted . upon a speech from Mr.
Belasco. .
The. play is a straight comedy, and, al
though the title rniKlit Imply otherwise,
there is nothing of either suggestlveness
or horse play about It. It depends for
its drawing powers upon the cleverness
of itÃ lines and the amusing situations de
veloped. The cast was selected by Mr.
Belasco, who Is backing the play hlm
eelf, and Includes Blanche Bates. W. L.
Lemoyne. Frank Worthing ana other
capable artists.

BAN QUENTIN PRISON. Dec. 25.-
This was a red-letter day for the con
victs, and the recollections of Christmas of
'90 will not fade from their memories for
years to come. Rev. B. Fay Mills came
over from Oakland and attended to the
spiritual needs of the prisoners In the
morning, while In tho afternoon the offi
cials paid attention to the material ele
ment by Riving the wards of the State a
sumptuous meal.
Rev. B. Fay Mills addressed the In
mates in the prison chapel at 10 o'clock in
the mornlns, the harden of his theme bo
inpr. the love pervading society, which
acts as the leaven of humanity. He was
assisted l-y Chaplain Drahms, and the
two preachers had an audience of 800
convicts, many standing in the rear of
the church and crowding the aisles.
Music was rendered by a quartet of four
prisoners, whose performance was such
as to excite favorable comment from the
many visitors present.
At 2 o'clock the convicts, 1300 strong,
were marched into the large dining hall
and seated at a table spread with many
luxuries not generally permitted. Warden
Ajrulrre, Captain Edgar, Overseer Joseph
AlTUlrre and Steward Chappelear all as
sisted In the affair and did their best to
make It a success.
To rive a, good Idea of the enormous
quantity of food consumed by the con
victs, it may be mentioned that the order
of the commissary for to-day's meal in
cluded 100 gallons of mincemeat, 1800
pounds of roast pork, twenty-two boxes
of apples and three barrels of cranberry
sauce. In the pudding were 200 pounds
of rice, 200 pounds of raisins and forty
gallons of milk. Milk was also allowed
to-day for the coffee.
The convicts were locked In their cells
at 3 o'clock in order to permit the guards
to enjoy a llttlo extra time on tho holi
day. Following the early lockup on Sun
day, this was the only hardship the men
were obliged to endure. Â«

GENERAL BUTLER
GAVE VAIN WARNING
LONDON, Dec. 25.â From what I am
told. It appears that a ''<rm is brewing
in the rubject of the course of tho gov
ernment toward General Kir William But
ler. .whO3O ennduct at the outset Of the
war mot with much criticism. My Inform
ant sayÂ» that General Butler, previous to
the war. t-t-nt a series of dispatches w*rn-
Inj? tho Government against attacking the
Boers, filvlng details of their condition
for war which have been verified by re
! cent evenis. but hit- dispatches were very
distasteful to the government and wore
put away, out of sicht. anJ General But
ler was harshly criticised. General Hut
ler, it seems, drew attention to the way
Jn which i he English were misled by the
: blindness of the Intelligence Department,
which from what has taken place was to
tully un.v.vare of or purposely . misin
formed by the Boers as to their arms and
numerical strength.
it Is Â»yell known here that British
agents of the Intelligence Department
were Kent from time to time to tln<l out
what the Boctb were doing in the way of
armaments. The Boers knew all about It,
but they umulated naivete and conducted
the visitors around forts which they
chose for their own purposes, where o'd
puns were set ip and shown with an nf
fectatlon of pride by President Rrugcr's
men. who were cunning enough to Inspire
the strangers by their plausibility. Thus
the British Intelligence Department re
ceived the most minute renorts of the
caliber, range and number of the cannon
possessed . v the Boers, but were merely
gulled by the wily burghers. The real
guns, with which the war is conducted,
the Creusots nnd Krupps, were so care
fully hidden that scarcely a soul outside
the Immediate circle of the government
knew of them. Tin- English government
pent out ::t:ns equal in caliber to What tlie
agents had been allowed to see. .It Is
thought that the Boers understated their
numerical forces and small arms.

If what I am told be true at all these
things \vre told to life home government
by General Butler, with the result that
Butler was called disloyal and pro-H'>tr.
and rabid paper* demanded his degrada
lion. Bui since the war began people who
knew the tents <â ! General Butler's
dispatches have come forward .- â  n c i asked
that they be published. The attention of
members of Parliament has been called to
the matter, ..n i when the Commons are
assembled In six weeks' time demands
will be made f< r the publication of the
dispatcher. My informant says you n-.av
ask why <3encr.il Butler did not -!â¢â¢â¢â¢ out.
but remember thai he is a military man
in a hiph position, and says, 'My lips ar*Â»
sealed.', but the subject is now occupying
tho club gossips. I give you my views
without comment. One very clever club
man remarked that the question really
amounted to this: Is he a traitor or a

Mistook Judge for a Drummer.
When Judge 'Mark. now on the Supreme
Court bench of North Carolina, wax on
the Circuit Court bench he was â  stickler
for always opening court punctually on
Mondays. Having to open court at Ox
ford, in January, UM, when he Rot to
Henderson ho found a deep snow on the
ground and the railroad from thai place
to Oxford in those â 1.-i : did not run in
such weather. Bo the Judge set out i.i a
buggy with a driver whose customer! had
theretofore been commercial tourists. He
took the Judge for a drummer a/id tried
to beguile the tedium by talking over the
hardware line. Not finding him exactly
well posted on that he took up the dry
goods business. Not doing much better
with that he successively tried him on
notions groceries, liquors and others.
Having exhausted all the "lines" he could
think of he finally asked: "You are a,
drummer, are you not?"
"Yes." -aid the Judge, "I am somewhat
in that line." . . , *.
"Well, what is your line? said the
driver.
"I am a drummer for the State Poniten-
The driver, saying to himself, half
aloud, "You arc the first one In that line
that ever came alone here." drove the
rest of the way in silence. When the < â â¢'.
veyance drove up to the hotel in Oxford
the landlord ran out to greet his guest.
When the driver heard bis passenger
called "Judge." the point dawned on hm.

a cloud of snow with his wheels.

TWO DEATHS.
I""*nE year now closing is made memorable by
the death of two eminent Americans whose lives
* and work were identified on apparently opposite
side* of the same issue. The question t]i c cus^ed by
Dwight L. Moody and Robert G. Ingersoil has been,
::â¢ ..'.: ihcages iince man became self-conscious, the
hsuc of isn:es. With Job the world is always asking:
ft a n:an die shall he live again?"'
It is the habit to ascribe to Ingersoll the doing of
great harm. This ascription might be true if all men
were equally impressed by the supernatural. But a>
it is- true that ill :!csh is not one flesh, so it is true
that all minds are not one mind. Moody's consecrate!
vvuric was among tho>e whose minds are turned
to humanity only by the touch of the finger of the iÂ»
efFable and the supernatural. Their name is legion
among all people?, in the lands ac call Christian and
the lands v.c ca'l Pagan. Moody's work among them
Lnd his influence upon them have been an enduring
ficior in the history of his time. The lowly have been
lifted up, the sodden have been cleaned, the drunker.
sobered and the <Jull quickened by his power. The
dead instincts of unselfishness and sacrifice have
cmen from the tomb of many a cold heart and be
come alive at his bidding. The formal and perfunc
tory in rcCgion have felt his rebuke and been trans
formed into that life which is the essence and the all
of religion.
'.\ judgn.-.

.. .
Casting :imJc the dogmatic view of religion, and
considering that we arc all concerned \vit!i the lite
men live in this World, while only a pan of us arc
concerned in a life to come, about which Ingcrsoll
said thai he knew nothing, i; is not hard to feel that,
in the betterment of what is. hr and Moody were
associate apostles, and looking to finite results their
devoted labors v.ere to the same end.
They played upon the thousand strings of the same
harp, and the harmony that sprang from their touch
nay well merge in one fjnp. and its theme and rr.ir
â¢â¢â¢â¢â â¢ â¢
poÂ«e may well lÂ«e interpreted as the win:::? away of
all tears zrA the coming of righteousness. Their
cocr.try and their countrymen lay chaplets on their
tombs without shame, and the follower? of one may
strike palms with the followers of the other in alli
ance lo accomplish the great' end of ail religion, all
ethics end all philosophy, the cleaning and sweeten
irs cf this human life.
After yesterday s game between California and the
Carlivlc Indians who will jay that football is not bar

close shave. And that sno dream.

Now, how can these banks contract the currency?
No one ever tells how or why they should do it.
They have no means of recalling their own issue and
locking it up. As well might one try to call back to
its stalk the down of the thistle that has been set free
to fly with the wind. The issue has gone into myriad
hands and is deposited to be checked against in far
scattered banks. Nor can the banks hold money by
rcisir.g the rates .... prevent loan?, for the
maximum of that rate is fixed by law, and to exceed
it should forfeit the charter of the offending bank.
Did the Chronicle ever know a bank that tried to
make money by the deliberate ruin of its debtors, or
by the distress of the general community through
an artiricir.l depression of prices? Banks re the cus
todians of the surplus capital of the community, the
loan fund of the country. It belongs to their depos
itors. Modern business cannot depend upon any
other system for the use of necessary credit.

THE TEACHERS* CONVENTION.
rk< >M the TÂ« ' - Conveni n which assem
to-day in S;. :nuch is to be ex
pected, for the outline of work prepared for
ludes many important issues, and the
forei I educators of the State are expected to be
nt and take part in the dis upon the
problems involved. Much of the time of the con
vent: in the technical or
routine work of the Teachers' Association, but that
will not prevent di ration of other subjects
â  per import and of wider interest
A. f to the programme which has been an
cd one of the principal features of the proceed
upon the surest and prompt
of eh:nina:i^.Â£ personal and political inter
ference with our public school system. For the pur
pose of petting authoritative views upon the issue,
achers have invited a number of eminent men
to address them and take part in the debate. The
â¢ therefore promises to be one which will
~t at heast some means of limiting, if not wholly
putting an end to. what has lone: been recognized as
one of the most sei -s i:i the way of
earnest educators.
The management of public ?choo!s in either the
r the country i^ never an easy matter under the
â¢ â  ircumstancc-. There are a tho-:- 'ncles
in t!:e way oi success. Tht teacher has to deai with
the perver^itie'; of childhood augmented by the in
fluence of pel* every unruly child
to be more unruly than he would be at a school
where there are le^er number?; there are the per
versities of parents vjho do not always exert an in
iluence that is helpful to the teacher; there are al^o
difficult problems arising out uf school l2\vs; and
when to all these are added the push :ind the pull of
â¢ ians or job seekers forever interfering, it wi".
en that the career of a public school teacher i*
or.c that ca!! c for about as much patience, diplomacy
and energy a? any other in the world and receives but
small reward.
It bas been frequently pointed out that among the
prcate*t evils that affect and injure our system of
I'ubiic education are the frequent u=es of the schools
as parts of the spoils of politics; the u?e of school
â¢ â¢ 1 funds as perquisites by munici
pal 1 â¢ reward their followers; the occasional
g of school positXMU by corrupt tru-tees; th:
- in the i r the ptu
of obtaining positions elsewhere: and the wasting of
school funds either by careic-inets. or by fraud.
M'.:ch ha? been sail of these evils and they have
been apain and apain exposed and denounced by the
press and sometimes bj Rrand juries. Up to this
time, however, no really effective method of getting
rid of them has been devised. Evidences of their
existence are to be found everywhere from Xew Knq
land to the Pacific Coast. There can be no question
of the readiness of the people to apply a remedy if
one enn be devised, for on no subject are all classes
Of any American community more united than on
that of keeping politics out of the schools. If, there
fore, the convention at Sacramento can formulate
any plan of action well designed to eliminate the evil
it will achieve a great benefit not only for the teach
ers but for the State, and for that reason its proceed
ings will be watched with more than ordinary interest.
PARK IMPROVEMENTS.
HUNDREDS OF GUESTS ARE
DINED BY SALVATION ARMY
NEARLY 1800 people of this city
have the Salvation Army to
thank for the Christmas dinners
they enjoyed yesterday. In New-
York City 29,000 were provided with
their holiday meal, while In the United
States the number amounted to IjO.ooo.
These were the reports marie yester
day to Lieutenant Coionel Evans of
the local religious body. The colonel
and his staff had worked hard during
the past'two months to provide dinners
for the poor hero, and the banquet, for
such it was. was held yesterday in the
basement of the Odd Fellows' building.
By m. mi of letters, street boxes and
collectors the army managed to secure
about 1000 pounds of the finest turkeys.
SOO pounds of beef. 750 loaves of bread
and a like number of all kinds of pl*-s,
betides boxes, sacks and barrels of ap
ples, celery, potatoes, etc.
For days past a corps of cooks have
been at work in the kitchen preparing
the food, and when it was placed upon
the tables it was tempting enough for
the daintiest. Six long tables, capable
of accommodating 4jo people, were soon
tilled on the opening of the doors at 12
o'clock. An hour later and a similar
number were admitted, those holding
tickets standing in a long line on Ste

The transport Westminster was com

She sailed -from hero with 4"' horses and
mules and a cargo of fodder Sunday
afternoon, but got no farther than the
lightship. While on the bar a small stop
cock blew out and th.- steam escaping
into the furnaces blew a cloud of ashes
and cinders Into the bilges. The engineers
saw at a glance that in a few minutes the
bijge pumps would be choked and at once
notified the bridge. The captain- brought
the transport to an anchor and there she
remained all Sunday night and nearly
all of Christmas day keeping the light
ship company.

back into port. Th*> work of fixing the
Westminster up again did not take very
long, and she will be ready for sea. again
this morning. The damage was slight,
but neither captain nor engineers would
take any chances by going off shore with
the bilge pumps liable to choke up at any
moment. The crew as a whole was se
cretly glad that the accident happened
as it gave nearly nil of them a chance
to eat their Christmas dinner ashore.
The Westminster came back under her
own steam. â¢ * ,
Tile transport Valencia docked at Har
rison-street wharf yesterday. She will be
turned over to her owners during the
week and will then be jrpt ready for the
Cape Nome trade In the spring. The
vessel is to be thoroughly overhauled and
the Union Iron Works will put her boilers
In first-class shape. When completed the
Valencia will be in as good condition
again as when she went Into the trans
port service.
The Paciflc Steam Whaling Company
Intends running quite a number of its
vessels to the gold fields this year. Bo
sides the Valencia it will send north In
the spring the J<anle. Thrasher. Ex
celsior and Mary D. Hume. The latter
vessel was the pioneer of the steam whal
ing fleet to winter in the frozen north.
In nil she spent nearly nine years in the
Arctic, and when coming home this year
was nearly wrecked. Her stem was car
ried away and the vessel leaked s.i badly
that she nearly went down with ail
hands. She has now been rebuilt and
turned into as smart a little steam
schooner as there i? on the coast by Hay
& Wright. She will run between St.
Michael and Nome In connection with the
Steam Whaling Company's fleet.
The Thrasher has spent several winters
in the frozen north and the Jeahle was
one of the vessels succored by The Call's
relief expedition in 1897. Sho had a nar
row escape on that occasion, but has
been practically: rebuilt since then and Is
now as tine a four-masted steam
schooner as there Is afloat. ,

hands assembled on deck and gave three
rousing cheers for Captain Glass and his
officers.
Beggars were plentiful on the front yes
terday. Some of them were really deserv

and Foulkr -s of the Harbor Hospital were
standing on the corner of Mission and
East streets when a well-dressed man
with a "peg-leg" came along. He had an
empty salve box in his hand and told a
pitiful story about an open wound on the
stump of his leg and no money to get the

f?N ARGUMENT IN FAVOR
OF THE BOND ISSUES
ThÂ» Call il'-xmi net hold Itself responsible for
the opinions published in this column, but
present!" them for whatever valuÂ« they may
have as communications <>: general interest.
Editor of The Call: Forty years as;o
in Boston a party of progressive citizens,
fully appreciating the future Kreatneps
of their city, organized for the purpose
of devising ways and means of straight
ening and widening their crooked and
narrow streets and purchasing land for a
park rystem. It was estimated that
$3,000,000 would put the etreets In order
and buy sufficient land for park purposes,
as property values were then vory low.
Scarcely had they put forth th. plans
when the "conservative" element of the
community rose In their mlÃht and pro
tested that it was an outrage on the city,
â imply a job to provide driven for the
rich and tax the poor man out of his
home The arÃuments were used then
ni a i . a . ! ! l Uch , ppeelsr eels w *re mere luxuries.
IMiln l they ha th . c Common ant l Public
Gardens? They had been sufficient In the
past, were they not sufficient for the
present and future? Who ever heard ol
wide streets in Boston? Who ever heard
lof fountains and beautiful drives? Who
i>ut a madman would be willing to put
the city In debt for such unnecessary
purposes? Wouldn't It be better, if we
must .nave those new-fancied ideas, to
tax the life out of the citizens as nny
n.tk.n;, human l,.inÂ«? would do and buy
such thlnirs for cash?
Â»7Ja** v "."'' ni '"y" y " Ih " r aricuments w^rr
used against all effort! to place â¢â 
Jn line for Its future development.
J has b*en t he rÂ»-
It Is true there were no mortgage* cxc-
they congregated In the sun near by and
smoked the stumps of cigars or cigar
ettes made of cheap tobacco.
Hut the great majority were deserv
ing, and the feast, maybe the flrtt
good meal for weeks, was a blessing.
The stories of no work, rent duo and
want in all Its hldaÂ»uÂ»ness that were
carried Into the dining-room would be
heartsicker.ing. One family, father,
mother and live children, were deaf
mute?, and for w.Â«k3 bread and water
had been their fare. These were the
only ones, who did not appreciate the
music furnished by the Salvation
Army band, which discoursed army
tones from .1 raised platform at th*Â»
end of tbe hall. Some camÂ© with bas
kets and took away food for those at
home whom s!rkneÂ«Â« had prevent*-!
from coming out. In fact, this dis
tribution was one of tho principal fea
tures of the army workers. Besides
the baskets hundreds of boxes contain
ing good nourishing food were sent to
the poor of the rlty. Even thoÂ«Â« whom
the city fathers are supposed to pro
vide for, the unfortunates at the leper
colony, received a whole cartload of
pood things to eat. Colonel Evans
state* that the condition of the leper*
is shocking, medicines and the rommon
necessaries of life not being furnished
by the Supervisors.
These Christian workers do not pro
pose to cease their efforts to relieve
suffering humanity with the one Mjf
banquet of yesterday. On their books
are the addresses of scores of famine*
who have been reduced to distress by
poverty, and arrangements ar*Â» being
made to see that their sufferings ara
made Ice? by provisions, which will be
sent out during the entire winter; and
for all the good It is doing the Salva
tion Army is takine no credit to Itself,
but rather gratefully thanks t.-. - â¢
who are assisting In the work by con
tributing goods, fuel, money and cloth
ing which are being distributed. -
cutea to buy diamonds for shirt-fronts
instead of tho necessary pork and bears.
nor were there rows of sparkling foun
tain? erected In their court yards, but
their children have expanded because r.f
the widening and straitrht*-ninÂ«r of streets
through condemnation proceedings on nn
average of more than $1,QOO.OXÂ» per year
for tho past thirty years and more than
jIS.COu.OOQ fur park purposes and thÂ« tnd
Is not yet.
Shall we profit by their mistake* ar.rt
prc-paro for the future? Or shall we do all
we can. as we have in the past, to retard
and delay the future of our city?
In conclusion, bear in mir.d that It 1Â«
all folly to say that you are In favor of
public improvements If you allow thÂ«
'â¢other fellow" to do all the vutlnp. Re
member that every man who is opposed to
the bond issues will j-o to the polls and
his vote rvill count two asatnat your ona.

A V^^ toward men." . .
y Robed priests have Intoned
{he mass in glory of the Sa
vior; ministers of the gospel
of every creed have knelt at
thÂ« altar in commemoration of his birth;
from the throats of children have floated ;
anthems in his praise; around the tree of
gifts babies have danced with happy '
hearts, and even Into the dungeons and
through the wards where lay the sick and
dying the light of his mercy has brought
hope and love and gladness. Another :
Christmas has passed and with It even
the memory of the hardships of former
years have grown dimmer, but the I
black cloud of war has cast its shadow
over homes around* whose tires faces of a
year ago are missing and ever will be, as
they have fallen, martyrs to their coun
try, on the fields of battle.
Turning one's thoughts from the graves
of the dead to the bright homes of the
quick, to the tabernacles of worship and
the houses of pleasure, memory cannot
recall a merrier, brighter, more prosper
ous Christmas. From the windows of
manyâ a majority of the homesâ candles
swinging gracefully from the limbs of
evergreens threw out their light, cheering
these who passed on their way to scenes
as bright. Even in the district where the
poor reside the kindly hand of charity had
reached, and bright-eyed children blended
their voices with those that sang a carol
of worship for the blessings of the presem
and Intoned In prayer, calling lor a better
fortune In the tuture. r
In the churches of the city the devout <
gathered and mingled their" tongues in
worship of the martyr of Calvary. Elab
orate .â !.:..- marked the celebration of
Christ", nativity at Grace Church. The
decorations were beautiful because of
their simplicity. Four- evergreen trees
were placed be fore the altar, with . here
and there a sprinkling of holly berries and
ferns. The music rendered by the regular
choir under the direction of Organist
Theodore Vogt was especially Inspiring,
and the Einging of "Noel at the offertory
by S. Homer Henley was an interesting
feature. The other numbers were: Open
ing anthem. "Christ Is -Risen" (Theodore
Vogtj; "Te Deum" (Holden);' "Jubilate"
iKet-s).
Dr. Foute's theme for his sermon was
"Christmas tho L'nlvercal Holiday."
Throughout his discourse he wove the
beautiful story of the nativity In a de
cidedly novel and Interesting way, a story
that appears never to grow old and al
ways enÃages the best attention of the
trvil- Christian.
"The fact that people of all classes,"
said Dr. Fouto, "from the three wise and
powerful kings of the East down to the
lowly and humble shepherds of Bethle
hem paid homage to the new-born King
of mankind was but a precursor to the
acceptance of the Son of God by all the
tuitions of the earth. Christ was the only
man whose birth had been expected, !<â¢â¢
had been tne desire of the world ever
pine the beginning of recorded time. They
looked for him In palaces, on thrones, at
the head "i vast armies, in Imperial
Rom*, and found him In a manger, down
among tho cattle. Christmas Is the crown
ing festival of redeemed humanity. Other
festivals have died with the people who
Instituted them, but the anniversary of
Christ's nativity has and will endure for
ages. Millions of people throughout the
universe are brought together In the ob-
Forvance of the day. Only China, Central
Asia and darkest Africa remain un
touched by its influence, but they, too.
will fall into line and soon the world will
cease warring and fighting and will meet
In one festival of peace and good will."
Father MacCorry. who on behalf of the
Paullst Fathers delivered the sermon at
St. Mary's Church. Dupnnt and California
streets,- spoke on the "Lowliness of
Christ. " An unusually large crowd lis
tened to his address. In part he said:
Is there room, think you. In our modern
Foclety tnr Jesus? Pass In at the ballroom
door. There Is mom (or many things In
our mMcm society; room for the 6lmperlng
imbecile; room for the i>alnted doll; room

ThÂ«* Joy and the thrill and the ecstacy of J
Christmas be with you all.
Although in some Institutions through
out 'the city the inmates through official
neglect were prevented enjoying the holy
day as they bad expected, the majority
were full of praises for tho kindness
shown them. At the City nnd county
Hosnital the unfortunate ill were royally
treated. Owing to the special donation
made by Mi Phebe Hearst and the con
tributions of other charitable people of
the city nothing was lacking on the
board. The lame, the halt and the blind,
and even those whom fate had laid pros
trate on their beds, enjoyed the Christ
mas meal and were nappy at the thought
that they had been remembered on the
birthday of the Son of God.
Poor, wasted beings at the Almshouse,'
men and women awaiting the end that
must come to all, were not neglected.
They Flppod their coffee over the bones
of turkey, and all who wanted It sipped
their wine. It was a merry day among
th>.- old people, and the eyes of many,
dimmed with age or disease, moistened
nt the thought of daysâ of a Christmas â
tKat had passed, but they were content
that their lot was not worse.
Christmas came as a day of Joy to the
many sick soldiers at tho Presidioâ those
who have fallen for their country on the
fields of battle or whose devotion to duty
has stricken them with fever or other
disease. To some the future seems bright.
to others the last Christmas on earth has
passed; and they aTe awaiting the blowing
of taps after they have passed beyond
tho valley of the shadow of death.
Surgeons, hospital corps men and nurses
of the different wards quarreled good
naturtilly with each other in their ef
forts to make their special division of the
barracks the most attractive.
Christmas was most noticeable at the
Presidio by the change in the barrack bill
of fare, the immunity from work and
drills for regular and "rooky," and the
holiday crowds that strolled up and down
the post roads and lingered until the sun
set gun.
' The troop and battery cooks outdid
themselves and built around the turkey,
which formed the center of each feast,
all manner of army dishes. There was
plenty to eat rind to spare, and the sol
diers made good the lack of presents
with the plentiful presence of what there
was for the Christmas dinner.
In the hospital things were done on a
little more elaborate scale than in the
barracks. The corps table had a bill of
fare neatly printed in the hospital print
ing olllce, nnd the patients had another
differing slightly from that of the corps
men. The bill of fare at the corps table
was as follows:
SOUP.
Cream Tomato.
<-.\L.\l>.
Crab. Shrimp.
RBUBHC&
Radishes. Celery. Pickles.
ROAST.
Roast Turkey with Dressing, Cranberry Sauce.
VEGETABLES.
Mashed Totatoos. String Beans.
Uaked Kweet Potatoes. Sweet I'eas.
PABTRT.
J'lum Podding.
Mmc Tie. Jelly Cake. Cocoanut Cake.
Chooolute Cake. Xuts. Italstns.
Apples, Bread and Butter. Coffee.
The patient* had the sane menu, but
with the addition of crab and shrimp
mind and plum pudding. One hundred
and forty men of the hospital sat down
at the table and 375 patients dined in the
wards and patients' dining-rooms.
In the nature of 'things the majority of
the older people of tho city remained at
home with their youngsters and passed
Christmas in general merry-making.
Places of entertainment, however, were
open for those who preferred to pass the
day in a Bearch of such amusement. In
consequence a large audience assembled
at tho Ttvoli to enjoy "Little 80-Peep,"
the holiday extravaganza, which was put
on for the tirst time Saturday night. It
was an appreciative audience, too, and
Ferris Hartman, as usual, came In for tho
major portion of the applause, which was
liberally distributed throughout the per
formance. But, while Ferris was tirst. the
other stars of the cast were by no means
given the overlook. Alfred C. whelan, as
Old Mother Hubbard, was a whole show
in himself and kept everybody In an up
roar, while Phil Branson contributed his
full share to the entertainment. Miss An
nie Llchter as no-Peep and Miss Annie
Meyers as Little Boy Blue were all that
could be desired. The chorus, splendidly
costumed and perfectly trained by Miss
Ida Wyatt, produced a pleasing effect,
while the special scenery which is used
in the production added to the magnifi
cence of the spectacle. Altogether, for a
.musical farce. "Little 80-Peep." barring
a few scenes where the action drags a
trifle, is a pronounced success.
Such was the way the rich, tho poor
the ill and the dying passed Christmas
day in the city. For the many It was a
day of pleasure and contentâ for the few
a day of sorrow, but .yon unto them
there came a ray of hope for a better fu
ture, and th" more fortunate offered their
prayers that their hopes might be real
ized.
Rev. E. Xelander of the First English
Lutheran Church preached a beautiful
Christmas sermon -to his congregation
yesterday morning. The subject of his
dlscourno was "The Choir of Heaven In
the Fields of. Bethlehem." In part he
said:
Swing open thÂ» Kates'. .Come In, O Christ
mas day, fragrant with a thousand memor
ies, and tell us again of Him who forsook
a throne to be cradled In a manger. This
day Is the birthday of Prince Jesus. Shall
It be celebrated by cannon's roar and the
ringing of bells as when an earthly prince
Is born? Nay; rather let the bells of lov
ing hearts rinc out peals of gladness and
Joyous songs salute the new-born King.

THOMAS GAINSBOROUGH.
From the original, by himself, in the P. my.
who divided the honors with his dis
tinguished rival. Sir Joshua Reynolds;
ho painted the beauty of English woman
hood as no one ever did before or since,
and In addition he was a landscape
painter of the first order.
Naturally so gifted a man must
been little short of a geniusâ a
which really described this lnterestin;,
artist, Since hia SU< â¢
of Uttle stud> "T preliminary training,
but came rather by intuition, sir .1
Reynold* said of him: '"if era ti.
tlon should produce genius sufficient to

In the history Of art among th
of that rising name." And it will be re
membered that Sir Joshua had n>> r

deadly rivals In their art.

Aiwa attractive personally and having
much distinction of manner, a character
istic which clung to him through life, his
life In the metropolis added an extra pol
ish and refinement which greatly im
pressed his provincial friends. At 19 be
married. vague reports orthe woman
of hla choice give little insight into his
home life, save that the wife was an or
dinary woman and beneath him in every
way. She was a Miss Margaret Burr and
â he bad a dowry of Â£200 a year. It is re
ported that she was a natural daughter of
the Duke of Bedford. Whatever the in
advisabillty of the union, it does not seem
to have handicapped him in his art. and
shortly he removed to Ipswich, where for
fifteen years he lived in great content
ment, turning when the day's work was
over to his music, to which he was pas
sionately devoted, In the meanwhile the
convivial habits acquired in London were
continued here, and with his friends he
made merry in the tavern and drank far
Into the night; not, however, as It ap
pears. seriously to the detriment of his
art. for he went steadily forward in his
work.
An Important change of residence took
place when Gainsborough, upon the ad
vice of an influential friend named Thick
nesse. went to live at Bath. That city
was then the most fashionable resort In
all England, and probably no town of
fered greater advantages for a portrait
painter. Ftople of wealth and social po
sition, with' plenty of time hanging Idly
on their hands, welcomed the opportunity
to sit to the artist, and from the begin
ning, having taken a pretentious house,
Gainsborough never lacked for patrons.
He now charged 40 guineas for a half
lentta portrait and 100 for a full-length,
and had about all he could do, though he
still found time to paint landscapes. The
Royal Academy was founded In it- - and
Gainsborough contributed to the second
exhibition. His connection with tho Insti
tution, however. Is somewhat obscure,
though an R. A. was appended to hiÂ«
name In the first catalogue: but he hid
frequent and serious quarrels about the
hanging of his pictures, and was rarely
out of hot water with the authorities of
tho place. Indeed, he seems to have been
of a somewhat impetuous disposition, and
had many misunderstandings with his
friends all through life.
Thick:) himself gave Gainsborough
many commission! both at Ipswich and
Bath, and lor him he painted a picture of
some yachts passing Landguard fort, with
a foreground of shore, with cattle. The
work, which was subsequently damaged
so as to be lost, was engraved, and the re
production added considerably to the
painter's reputation and spread his fame.
For twenty years Thlckncsse, who was an
astute man of affairs, devoted himself to
Gainsborough's Interests, and even after
that time, though separated by a serious
quarrel, be still maintained an active In
terest In the painter's career, doing i in
many services and calling attention to the
excellence of his work. In time Gains
borough's reputation attracted the atten
tion of King George 11. Pictures sent to
the Royal Academy and portraits of dis
tinguished men and women gave Gains
borough a vogue, so that he felt com
pelled to return to London and make the
most of his talents In a material wuy.
Thither in 1774 he went, establishing him
self in part of a handsome residence In
Pall Mall. Almost at once the King sent
for him and had him paint the portraits
an Dyke. Dr. Ruszcl! Sturgls. Dr. A. I*.
tr and ethers.
of hlmsnlf and the Queen: aristocracy
followed suit, nnd before loiir the palmer
was overwhelmed with commissions.
About 1773 there was produced the fa

lic as well This was
to thÂ»Â» charrrln of the
artist, who desired
puccÂ«ss no less for
his irk after nat
ure out of doors than
for his figure compo
sitions or portraits;
but It was not to be.
nnd his amh!.t!on la
this direction was
never realized, for,
although the worlil
has come to admlro
his landscape work.
It Is In portraiture
that his efforts nro
best appreciated, and
on this rests Ms
Â« I aim to fame. Tho
landscape work
shows tho Inspira
tion of the school of
Claud, and is a mingling of the classic
with tho realistic. The compositions
are somewhat conventional, ami th-Â»
forms of the trees arc nearly always
preconceived, but the color urn the feel
ing are of the first order. Still, as com
pared with his portraits, they have
neither the power, thu distinction nor the
convincing quail that are pre-eminent
there, and they must of necessity tako
second place.
Of few extravagant habits. Gainsbor
ough's splendid Income sufficed for all
his wants. He spent freely In the pur
chasing of musical Instruments, for which
he had a- passion, and at his death he left
qulto a collection; and. aa ha* been Bald,
he was convivial, but even In his extrava
gance was mild. He died in July. 17SM.
from cancer. Sir Joshua Reynolds wan
sent for/ and generously forgetting thÂ«
breach between them, came at once and
was with him aa he passed away. Hl*
last words were: "We aro all going to
heaven, and Van Dyck is of the party."
Although exceedingly dexterous with his
materials, Gainsborough Mt the highest
standards for himself, being most par
ticular and painstaking In all he did. It
not Infrequently happened that he de
stroyed before his sitters portraits that
were eminently satisfactory to them, ex
claiming that hi could not get that which
ho was after: he maintains! a most dig
nified position in regard to his art ami
his professional standing, not hesitating
to resent arrogance or familiarity even
with the most important patrons, many
of whom were bowed out of the studio
never to be permitted to re-enter under
any circumstances. Ho w;is perfectly de
voted to h!s art. and would often after a
hard day's work sp^nd the entire even
ing amusing hlnwlf painting by candle
light. Indeed. Reynolds, referring to this,
thought possibly the habit of working at
night disclosed to him many secrets of
color, for he maintained "by candlelight
not only objects appear more beautiful,
but from thÂ«lr being In a preater breadth
of light and shadow, ns well as havlnjr
a greater breadth ami uniformity of color,
nature appears In a higher style, even the
Mesh seeming to take a richer and higher
color." The splendor of fSalnsborough'a
color was not equaled by nny of his con
temporaries, and the distinction he gavo
to his portraits was unique. Like all gen
iuses, he was uneven, and It not Infre
quently happened that hi.* drawing was at
fault. It was In the portraits of women
that he wax particularly successful, fop
he gave to femininity all of Its charm,
refinement nnd subtle beauty that so ap
peals, nnd which la so difficult of realiza
tion. These likenesses of English women
had soul, personality ami the flash of
life: and. finally, r.s one of his critics puts
It cleverly, be had the "Intemperate ex
cess of distinction."

LODGED IN THE TANKS
ARRESTED BY POLICEMEN Mc-

The Suspected Murderer Refuses Ab-

Captured.
"U'ife-beater Jeremiah Dullca, whO3Â© wife
died on Sunday night, supposedly from
the" effects of a beating he had adminis
tered earlier In the day, was arrested last
night by Policemen Tyrrell and McCormac
and lodged In the tanks at the City Prison
pending the result of the Coroner* au
topsy. The policemen, who are connected
with Captain Si>illano"s division, had abso
lutely nothing upon which to work but
a poor description of Dullea given by tho
landlady of the house ut 733 Kolsom street,
whore he and his wlfo lived.
Late yesterday afternoon Tyrrell and
ilcCormac got a tip that Dullea some
times frequented the Lindell House, a
cheap bed house at the corner of Sixth
and Howard streets. They went there
about 9 o'clock last night, and when they
arrived at the clerk's office at the head of
the stairs the policemen noticed a man
answering Dullca'a description talking In
un excited fashion to Antone. the night
cli'rk. The policemen listened, and they
heard him tt 11 the night clerk to put h!rn
in a room and if anybody called for him
to say he was not there.
Tyrrell and McCormac accosted the ex
cited mr .i and he reluctantly admitted
his Iden.lty. but swore ho did not Inflict
any injuries upon his wife which would
cause her death. After placing Dullea In
the tank* the policemen went to a saloon
at the corner of Sixth and Kolsom street.*,
where they found tho ax which Dullea

turmoil characterized their married
life after the honeymoon, and it was
ended three years ago In a divorce
being granted Mrs. Heggerty. Evi
dently there was still a warm spot In
Heggerty's heart for his ex-wife, for
he frequently suggested to her to call
It off and remarry him. The answers
he received were cold and haughty,
but he did not despair.
For the past year ho has been in
Bethany accumulating a large sup
ply of love for the ex-Mi Heggerty.
Then he came to San Francisco to offer
himself to her as a Christmas present.
He popped the question for the last
time on Sunday night at the home of
his adored one, 373 Dore street He
was to receive his answer Christmas
morning, and. by way of encouraging
him to have hope, he was invited to
partake of turkey with the family
over which he had once been lord and
master.

had entered a vigorous protest. The
farmer was greatly displeased to have
Ills stepson block the way when the
road to victory appeared so clear. He
told Crow that he would take bis
mother whether he liked It or not. and
proceeded to satisfy his wrath by scat

the house. Crow threw him out of
doors, and Mrs. Heggerty shouted for
a r'ullceman to load him away. The
Mrong arm of the law cooled him off
somewhat, and he left the scene of his
love affair, vowing that he would re

for tho Police. Park. "Fire. Election and

work of selecting the risht kind of men
to manage educational affairs and direct

The Mayor had In mind for the Hoard of
Public Works three well-known citizens.
One of the three, W. F. Dohrmann. de

citizen, v. hot name is not disclosed, also

outset Mayor Phelan'a ideal Board of
Public Works vanishes. Democratic
statesmon who were prominent in the
councils of the Committee of One Hun

and practical men can be readily found.
The Mayor, however, does not conceal his

Lord Fauntleroy Jenks. was also an "or

upon the Alford list, and yesterday it
came out that he bad taken the l>lt be

a warm friend â â â  Bylngton, and at the
Democratic convention Is said to have
given up his fight for the nomination in
Hyington's favor upon the understanding
that he would be satisfactorily placed.
Another organization nominee whom
Bylngton will honor by* appointment Is
Charles B. Peery, who will go In as chief
bond and warrant clerk. Peory's ap
pointment will h.Â» as satisfactory to ily
ington as to McNab and Phelan, on he
lias an excellent reputation, both private
and profefHion.nl. and carries a strong po

probably name Ike Harris and James
Hauly far Police Court prosecutors. His
other appointments to these offices arc
still in the air.
Mayor Phelan's appointments will be
announced this week. The charter pro
vides that he shall fill the offices of which
he has the disposition between the Ist of

"THE CHRISTIAN,"
BY HALL CAINE,
IS HEARD HERE
Frawley Company in
a War Play.
ORPHEUM PRESENTS FOUGERE
Th.Â» production of "The Christian" Is
one of the leaser episodes in the dramatic
history of R.xn Fr.incieco. The play has
had a ppl^ndM fucccss wherever It has
been given, and It Is one of the things
that we of San Francisco have long been
awaltiiyr.
"The Author" I* at pain* to point out
In a note on the programme that though
the play is described as founded on the
novel. It 1* not altogether the Fame In
Us character or lta motive. "What
dramatization of a novel la the .me as
thÂ« In its character and its mo
tive .
It Is essential to dramatic structure
that the elements and Incidents of a
story must l>e altered and rearranged be
fore It Is suitable for presentation on the
*tape. Thf Apology of .tho author |s,
tfierrfnre, idle,' and would appear to ask '
Indulgence for thÂ«i play from those who
have read the novel.
I have not read "The Christian" and am
therefore perhaps the better prepared to
judge thÂ«* pl.iv ns a play. It is a clever
faJco. That sounds rather severe, but will
admit of explanation. "Tho Christian" U
clrver. sufficiently compart and in spots
very strong. y< t it is Mill a fake, if for no
other reason th.'in it wan written by that
high-priest of Inkers Hall Came. It Is .1
good play, a Rood sort of refined mold
drama, that makes for the hip billows of
â¢ motion rather thnn tho finer vibrations
of the intellect. Thorn am muny mo
xnent*. if the story were served as a sen
eatlonnl serial, thÂ« words "continued in
our r.Â«xt" would mmc In most aptly. An
appropriate background for clear.cut
chunks of sentiment and heroism Is sup
plied by a growling mobâ an adjunct to
the drama ns important for working up
an audience as the orchestra is In mod
ern opera. I must not forget while on
this subject that the organ is used in "The
Christian" as a sut>stttute ... slow
rouble of 1Â«'FÂ« reserved plays.
There wa* a feeling prevalent in the
town that the company presenting "The
Christian" was an Inferior one which hail
be-en palmed off on us as others have
been, and in a measure this Is true. It is
â¢n inferior company but yet a Rood one.
Inferior, no doubt, to the companies that
have played in New York, and which,
through thÂ« parsimony of our managers,
we nre prevented frÂ«>m seeing. 1 was most
agreeably disappointed in the players at
the Columbia, who. if not first-clnss. are
better than second rate. Bflle Ellsler pnr
ticularly was a surprise. Her naturalness
Is delightful and she has tho discriminat
ing touch of the true artist in the emo
tional scenes. She does more than make
Ifood the handicap of diminutive stature,
nnd Is always the most vital member In
the scenes of which she is anhare. Mr. Col
ville as John Storm is Interesting. The.
part is one in which much depends upon
the personality <>f th*Â» actor, the. elements
of force and sincerity which he can bring
lo his aid. Colvllle falls f-hort of being
convincing, but the figure of the cleric as
ne makes him is vital and strong. Col
ville'n voice lx absolutely noble. Kdward
Em<Â»ry doÂ«Â« the young rake. Ijnni Robert,
with a fidelity of character that is ad
mirable, nnd Carrie Hoylo as Mrs. Calen
der shows quite remarkable feeling for
dlalr-ct and other marks of merit. The
other roles are so well taken as not to call
for criticism, exec tit "in the rase of Fan
chnn Campbell, who as I'olly strikers a
decidedly discordant note In the second
act. The rabble Is well managed and more
or Ices hideously artistic.

Orpheum.
Fougere, the Parisian chanteuse, Is the
bright, particular ftar of the holiday at
tractions at the Orpheum this weÂ«k, and
last night she quickly captivated the
large audience. She was suffering from a
severe cold, but struggled bravely through
her part. Her French songs were ren
dered with the charm that Is quite en
trancing, and when she sang "Hello, Ma
Baby she literally brought down the
house. Her personal charms add greatly
to her success. Mr. and Mrs. Edwin Mil
ton Royle and company appeared in a
new. sketch, "Trip's Troubles, which. was
very clever and caused no end of fun
with Its amusing complications. Harrl
can, the originaT tramp Juggler. was*at

were greeted with great appl.iuse. John

petite comedy, "The Substitute." natal)

comedian, was unable, to appear owing to
a cold, and Hamilton Hill, the Australian

attractive bill.

California.
A crowded house greeted "Cumberland

lacked In any mark of approval of the

enough to disturb any one's slumbers.
There is much about the piece that is en
tertaining and more that Is rather exas

It Is beneath the Frawleys. The admirers
of the company expect something better.

fair tO cause a political on.- In the city of
Oakland, it has cemented old friendships
that had been broken. It has broken old
alliances and mad- new ones. It will be
the cause of the most bitter legal battle
that baa ever been fought In the city of
Oakland. It may ev.-n cause a political
turnover, so great Is the intertst In this
case.
l>r. Woolsey win have to appear in the
PoUce Court to-morrow to make his pre-
â¢ limlnary plea to the charge made by
, Agent Kennedy of the Boctet) fot the Pre-
vention Of Cruelty tO Animals that he did
not provide for ins horse. That pleu will
be â 'not guilty," and then the case will be
set for trial.
The horse will Have to be brought Into
court or a.s near the court .is it is possible
to get the animal. Uolh Dr. WOOliey and
< Kennedy d< mand that the animal
be produced for the Inspection of the
court. Dr. Woolsey Will demand that the
h"is. be brought right before the court
for examination, and he says:
"That horse will be the most imi>ortant
witness 1 will have. 1 want him brought
' right into court and to be given the stand
; Just as a regular witness. That bone has
been a pet and 1 would not 111 treat him.
1 am not afraid to have him produced for
inspection before any court, and I will
have the greatest line ol expert and
tine testimony in support of my assertion.
I will not let any one blackmail me into
joining any society. 'NttST 1 will tight that
1 case for me to the last legal effort that
I can be made, even If he did say things in
1 that Hodge-Nichols case. He \i us only

other one."
Agent Kennedy of the Society for tho
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals says:
"This talk of blackmail Is pre|x>sterous.
I received many complains from outsiders
that that horse had been permitted to r. -
main in an open lot without shelter and
without food for months, and I will not
permit a man who ill treats a horse to go
unpunished. DO matter what his standing

So this arrest has healed tho once

One friendship has been renewed. l>r
Woolsey has determined to spend money

son of the owner of Yellowtail. and many
others, and from the prominence of the
list that he is preparing It ts evident that
the case will become a celebrated one.
Some of the experts will be arrayed

be a bitter ore its echoes will be heard In

OPIUM JOINTS
TO BE SHUT OUT
OF PLEASANTON
Citizens Discover a
Startling State.
PLEASANTON*. Dec. 23.â Opium Joints,
running under the guise of Chinese wash
houses anil bazaars, where young girls, as
well as men and boy-, are Initiated Into
the mysteries of opium-smoking, are run
ning in the midst of Pleasanton. The citi
zens have become so aroused by this con
dition of affairs that they have petitioned
the Board Of Town Trustees to have these
dens closed, and this petition will be pre
sented to the Town Trustees at their nest
meeting.
There are three of these bazaars and
Chinese laundries at which opium-smok
ing is allowed for white young people,
and there are several prominent young
ladies, who are scarcely more than girls,
who have been known to go to these
places, besides many of the male sex of
all ages.
This condition of affairs has become so
notorious that the citizens of the town
have determined to stamp out the evil and
not subject their boys and girls to the
temptations of the dangerous drug. The
three principal dens in IMeasanton are lo
cated on Spring street, near St. Mary's,
and It took but â  very few moments to se
cure sixty names to a petition asking the
Town Trustees to close these places by
law as ,i protection to the youth of the
town.
There is already â  town ordinance which
makes the keeping of an opium Joint a
â¢ misdemeanor, but it has never been en
forced. It was always known, to some ex
tent, thai these places wen opium dens,
but It was never suspected until recently
that white persons were among the fre
quenters. There was a disposition to let
the Mongolians of Pleasanton smoke if
they wished, but It was found a few days
ago that there were white frequenters of
these places, and that th- â  were at least
three girls, who were â¢ members of the
most prominent families In town, who ,
went there and smoked with Chinese and
white opium tlends.
This caused a determination upon the
part of the citizens who wanted tho youth
of the town protected to force the clos
ing of the dens, and the petition to the
Trustees was the result. The dens were
watched, and It was found that the white
smokers would steal In by night and the
g'.rls would go through dark alleys under
the cover of night, and rind their way
through back doors Into the bunks. Then
it was determined (hat the dens should
be absolutely driven out Of town, and it
will not require much urging on the part
of the people to cause the Trustees to I
take determined action.

STORY OF
THE GAME
Continued from Third Page.
day's game, paid: "Berkeley played a
better came than I expected. Its chief
fault was In fumbling. The field made a
great deal of difference In the Indians'
play. Owing to the- softness of the field
they were unablo to get off with a Jump.
which Is their strongest point. Berkeley
played an aggressive Rama. I would say
they compare with West Point .is a team.
There was very little off-side playing in
the game. The reason I did not penalize
the Indians In the nrst half, when one of
the men got off-side, was because a
I'erkeley player was also .it fault. I might
add that it Is not the custom In the- East
to penalize an even if one of Its men
Is off-Fide, co long as he doe* DOt par
ticipate In the play."
\N EXPERT
ON __THE GAME
The Match of Yesterday a
Great Comparative
Basis.
BY J. F. SHEEMAN JR.
That all the first-class football In Amer
ica 13 not played East of the Rockies the
University of California eleven of '99
demonstrated yesterday beyond question.
The team of the blue and sold surprised
Itself, surprised thÂ© football public and.
lastly, surprised the great eleven from the
Carlisle school. And, further, when East
ern experts appreciate the fact that all
things were practically equal relative to
extraneous elements that affect a team's
play, perhaps. If anything, favorable to
the visitors, an eye will be cast westward
and the elevens of California found to pos
sess much comparative merit with the
'vHrsitirs at H.nvi.r.f V*lÂ« nmi Ppln^ntnn
California did not realize its nearness
to equality with Eastern form, all things
being considered. Before the came. It is
iho opinion of many who had "soundd"
the Berkeley team thut a 12 to 0 score
against them loomed up Uko a victory.
â  Thus there web lacking the spirit that
normal confidence engenders, and thus a
certain after-season desultory manner of
practice ensued, even under the sharp
goading of Cochran and Kelly, which
caused a decided setback In Berkeley
from the Thanksgiving form. In short,
â  a stronger team physically and a faster
team In point of execution of plays has
represented California In the two seasons
Just past. 1 make this opening statement
{ in all fairness to our State team and as a
sort o{ defense in her behalf against many
rumors of arguments of a technical na
ture whercfrom the conclusion is reached
that Carllslo'6 scoring proves It was mili-
I tated against by the difference in the size
of ball used yesterday from that used on
Eastern fields, by a certain slow condition
of the field and by other new conditions,
and added to which It Is stated that lack
of actual team practice since Thanksgiv
ing day has Badly interfered with the
Indian offensive machinery. Poised against
each other the two theories of argument
ihave. only a sort of technical force, all of
which sinks Into insignificance when the
broad fact stands out that while Carlisle
certainly demonstrated her superior foct
ball Ã¼blllty In general force, aggressive
and defensive, and In finesse of execution
and of Individual prowess, yet ttie two
elevens fought each other to a bitter
standstill in the grandest football match
ever seen in the west, wherein victory is
carried back over the mountains to the
Eastern States by a meager flukeâ a
mfety score. And It will bo uccompanied
by an inwardnes of feeling among the
Carlisle boys which will reflect itself to
j California's credit that our great college
game, through the teaching of Cochran
and Kelly for Berkeley and Camp and his
disciples for Palo Alto, has wonderful
comparative possibilities on the Pacilic
Elope.
For fierceness and, yes. fairners of play
the game had no equal In our coast loot
ball annals. It Ss the spirit of this splen
didly trained Indian to enjoy a certain
reckless desperation in attack a;, ue
fense. California caught the fever and
principally In guarding her often closely
Ãbwuated goal lu-id her round for downs
In a manner that inspired, the cheers of
1 her followers. All credit and praise to
the stout work of Smith. Hall and Ellis
In backing up theJr lino and forcing ihe
] downs at critical times against such pow
erful plunging &3 the peerless -iletoxen,
displayed.
Offensively In point of the overwhelm
ing number of yards gained Carlisle crrel
ly demonstrated her superiority and the
very patent Eastern superiority over our
Western gamo. This difference Is em
braced in the single phrase "Every ma:i In
every play," a maxim the Indians follow
to the letter. Tun* and again a back
made his distance alone to be caught by
& comrade who whirled into the play from
Dehlr.d or the Eldo and forced him on for
another yard or so. In short the other
ten raerwhen the play is on, whether- it
be an Intricate close formation or a sin
gle straight buck of a half back, follow

repertoire. This is decidedly up to Jate

ginger this simplicity of attack, for the
poorly executed open trick plays wero of
no avail, was a cause of the absence of
expected scoring power. In all California

was elected captain for the year 1900.
There was no opposition and but a very
few minutes were necessary to select the
man for tho place.
Last year Whlpple, also a tackle, was
made captain, and with these two excep
tions it is a matter of many years since
a linesman has been selected to serve as
chieftain of the team. Whipple is a foot
ball man of experience, having played his
position on both the winning California
elevens. By many he is rated as the best
I tackle on the coast. According to Coch
ran'a judgment, Pringle would secure â 
position on any one of the big Eastern
varsity elevens If he would leave Cali
fornia for the East. The newly elected
captain is a Junior at the university, a
nu-mber of one of the leading fraternities
and a very popular student.
The California football team also re
ceived their souvenirs from the manage

small gold football with the word "cham

CHILD EATEN BY
MOUNTAIN LION
Horrible Death of Baby
Girl.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAX DIEGO. Dec. 23.-From the wilds
of Lower California la received the story !
of a child being carried off and eaten by j
a mountain Hon. The child was only 3 i
years old and lived near a place called
Nljl. It disappeared about a month ago. 1
Searching parties were organized and the â¢
country about was scoured for some
trace of the missing child, but none could
be found. It was thought that some Mex
ican had stolen the girl.
A few days ago, however, ns the father |
was going up a wild and rocky canyon :
which had been overlooked in the search !
be was horrified to find pieces of his i
child's clothing hanging on bushes and Â«
several bones scattered about on the I
ground. The father realized at once that |
his daughter had been carried off by a
mountain lion. The news prostrated his
wife. Mountain lions are numerous \:\
that section and become very bold when
driven by hunger to look for food. A
search Is being made for the skeleton of
the child.

OILER DROWNED OFF
STEAMER ZEALANDIA
SAD CHRISTMAS ACCIDENT ON
THE WATER FRONT.
George Holland Falls From a Ganj

Body Disappears.
An accident happened Â«:irly !n>t r.uht
on the steamer Zealandia n hJ
in the drowning of Oeorg< Holland, â

employed a* an oiler on the â¢â¢x-tmi.
The Zealandia is at Broadway wharf,
lyln^ alongside the earner- Pomona,
which hi at the dock. In order to board
the Zealandia it [is necessary to cross
from the Pomona on a gang plunk be
tween the steamers.
Holland had been ashore for' supper,
ami returned aboard the steamer shortly
after 7 o'clock with Robert Campbell, one.
of his shipmates. Meeting the Quarter
master, James McDonald, the men start
ed a good-natured conversation and they
were laughing at some remark when Hol
land, stepping back to an against the
rail, caught his heel in the boards of the
gang plank and fell over in the- open
space between the steamers and :nto I lie
dark waters beneath. â¢ â  . .
In Ills descent the unfortunate nan

ni.ly rendered Insensible. If not killed,
oon as Quartermaster McDonald saw
the man reach the water he lowered a
rope and Sailor Campbell let himself
down, and with one hand on the rope,
leached with the other to catch the fast
slnking body, but it sank from sight be
fore he could grasp it. The hat worn
by Holland was nicked up soon after the
accident and showed traces of blood,
strengthening the theory that the man
was badly hurt before reaching the water.
James Hopkins, a water-tender on the
Zealandia, grappled for two hours for the
body, but without success. The body will
probably drift. ashore under' the wharf, as
the tide was coming in at the time.
