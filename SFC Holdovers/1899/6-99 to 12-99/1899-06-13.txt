VOLUME LXXXVI- NO. 13.
FRANCE'S MINISTRY STEPS
OUT OF OFFICE.
PARIS, June 12. â Immedi
ately after the Chamber of
Deputies voted against them
to-day the French Ministry re
signed.
President Loubet accepted the
resignations, but requested them
to remain in their offices until
their successors are named.
It is presumed M. Loubet will
summons the presidents of the
chambers to-morrow in order to
consult with them on the forma
tion of a new Cabinet.
On leaving the Chamber M.
Dupuy observed to a group of
Deputies in the lobby: "We
hand over the business to luckier
but not to more courageous
men."
The Interview between M. Dupuy and
his colleagues and President Loubet
was brief but cordial. The President
expressed his thanks for the support
he had received from the retiring Min
istry, adding that he would always re
member their services gratefully. M.
Dupuy was agreeably surprised at M.
Loubet's cordiality..
Thf>re are already many surmises as
to the composition of the new Cabinet,
but it is pointed out that as the Dupuy
Ministry did not fall on a question in
volving the political complexion of the
Ministry, It is difficult to see on what
basis the new Cabinet will be selected.
M Dupuy has certainly not a good
press this morning. Whatever else
was the failure yesterday he succeeded
In uniting every political party against
him. Everybody condemns the display
of armed force at the Grand Prix. It
v.-.-.c really more like a military review
than a horse race, and all declare it was
unnecessary, the Royalists because
they are disgusted with the Auteuil af
fair and would have seen themselves
that there was no repetition of it. and
the Socialists because they have
thrown in their lot with the Govern
ment and consequently there was noth
ing really to be feared yesterday.
M. Dupuy's show of a perfect army
exasperated everybody: Even the
Figaro quarrels with him for overdoing
things. The Sieele's leader Is headed
"Fall of Dupuy," and Clemenceau asks
if there are not enough honest men in
the Chamber to rid France of a disas
trous man â namely, Dupuy â who only
stops plotting against all presidents of
the republic long enough to smash the
heads of republicans. Paul de Cassag
nac ironically applauds him as a mas
ter strategist. There is talk about a
n*'w combination Ministry under M.
"Waldeck Rousseau.
It is rumored at the offices of several
newspapers this evening that the Due
d'Orleans has been arrested at Nice.
Xo confirmation of (he report can be
obtained and it is quite improbable, as
he is supposed to be cruising on his
yacht.
A late dispatch from Nice reports a
rumor that a general of Italian origin
has been arrested on a charge of es
pionage.
ACTION THAT CAUSED
THE CABINET'S DOWNFALL
PARIS, June 12.â The Chamber of
Deputies was crowded to-day and there
was considerable suppressed excite
: â â  when M. Vaillant, Socialist, rep
resenting one of the divisions of the
lated the Government <m
.â¢lay's police outrages at the Pa
vilion d'Armenonville, and demanded to
know the instructions the Government
gave the police In regard to the Social

The Premier, M. Dupuy, replied, nay-
Ing that he realized that yesterday was
â¢â¢ day for all republican*. He
zed that there, had been few In
nd that the only instructions
to the police were to maintain order.
The Government, he continued, had or-
I nn Inquiry into the responsibil
ity for the affairs al th>' Pavilion d'Ar

tiio same time, the Premier pointed out,
the Government acknowledged the ser

The Chamber, after further debate, |
adopted by a vote of 321 to 173 the
order of the day proposed by M. Rueau,
Radical, representing the Second Dis- |
trict of St. Gautiens, which the Pre- j
mier refused to accept. j
After M. Dupuys statement. M.
Clovls Hugues, Socialist, and others, !

day were moved. The Premier sup
ported the order of the day of M. Sau

laration of the Government, for which i
priority was demanded, and refused by |
a vote of 253 to 246. ,-7; â â â¢ ]}/
AmldHt increasing excitement other
motions more or less favorable to the i
Government were defeated and the
Chamber then adopted, by 366 to 177,
priority for M. Rueau's motion.
Finally M. Dupuy. declared that the
Government would accept nothing of
M. Saumande's order of the day, and
the Chamber promptly carried M. :
Rueau's motion.
The text of M. Rueau's motion was as
follows: "The Chamber is determined
to support only a Government resolved
to defend vigiorously republican insti
tutions and to secure public order and
passes to the order of the day."
After the vote was announced the So
cialists shouted "Vive la Republique,"
the Ministers left the house and the
Chamber adjourned.
The successive votes In the Chamber
of Deputies to-day clearly demon
strated the existence of a majority, in
cluding members of all parties, who
were determined to rid themselves of
the premiership of M. , Charles Dupuy.
The interpellation of M. Vaillant was
simply a cleverly selected pretext to
conceal the real cause of the approach
ing crisis, i â¢â¢â ;.-";â . â¢ v
. Socialists and Radicals alike are dis
satisfied with what they have consid
ered the contradictory attitude of the
Dupuy Cabinet in the Dreyfus affair.
The Moderates hope to secure the- re
turn of M. Mellne to power. The revo
lutionaries, Nationalists and anti-Sem
ites hope, in their opposition, to M. Du
puy, to find a more tolerant man in his
successor.
This is the explanation f?f to-day's
voting, resulting in the downfall of the
Cabinet. The supporters of the (^>v
frnmont only numbered 173, recruited
for the most part from the ranks of
the 1-Cadieals.
Many Deputies agree that the Drey
fug affair Is largely responsible for the
fall of the cabinet. All of the Royal
ists and many of the Radicals declare
that their share of the responsibility

must be brought home to General Boia
deffre and General Merrier. At the same
time those taking this view have been
all along persuaded that M. Dupuy
would never proceed to that extreme.
Accordingly they seized upon M. Vail
laht's interpretation as a means of ex
pressing their defiance and distrust of
the Dupuy Ministry.
Certainly there is no denying the fact
that the question of the final settlement
of the Dreyfus case hangs like a dead
weight on the situation to-night and
will prove a great obstacle in the set
tlement of the crisis.

CANADA NOW SEEKS
FURTHER CONCESSIONS
Will Ask That Goods Imported Into
the Dominion From Alaska Be
Free of Duty.
WASHINGTON. June 12.â While hope
ful th.it the modus vivendi with Great
Britain respecting the provisional Alas
kan boundary will be settled upon the
tines laid down by Kmbassador Choate,
thero seems to be some apprehension in
official circles that the I,ondon govern
ment will demand further concessions.
So far as the boundary itsHf is concerned
the two governments are near enough
agreed to make it apparent that there
will be no httcb as to the location of the
line. There seems to bo a disposition to
believe that in view of Canada's failure
to secure a port on the Pacific for her
great Northwest Territory she will urk r ''
the British Government to ask of the
United States that all goods Imported
Into the I>ornlnion from th>> Alaskan coast
be permitted to come in frf-e of duty and
thai a certain zone be set asioV through
which goods could pass without hin
drance. This proposition has not yet been
submitted, but It is stated that if brought
to the attention of this Government it
will be immediately rejected whether th<'
concession desired be either temporary or
permanent.
The Dalton trail seems yet to be the
only point under discussion, and It is
stated with positiveness that the line will
be placed just to the north of the village
of Kluckwiin antl will not include it. This
location will deprive the Canadians of the
port they are so anxious to obtain.

NAVAL CEREMONIES AT
CAPTAIN NICHOLS' FUNERAL
MANILA, June 12, 3 p. m.â The
funeral of Captain Henry Nichols, the
commander of the United States
double-turreted monitor Monadnock,
who died from sunstroke on Saturday,
took place at Cavite yesterday with ap
propriate naval ceremonies. The offi
cers of the licet were present and the
flaps on all vessels were half-masted.
The sudden death of Captain Nichols
was particularly sad because it oc

result for which he had hoped and
worked for months was about to be

VOLUNTEERS THINK THE
REGULARS SHOULD BEGIN
WASHINGTON, Juno 12.âAd
jutant General Onrbin to-day re
ceived a letter from Major Gen
eral Otis, in which he makes
many complimentary references
to the Western volunteers. The
letter was personal in its char
acter, and General Corbin did
not make public its contents. In
discussing it with several friends
General Corbin stated that Gen
eral Otis has written that "the
Western volunteers were the
best fiphtprs in the world, hut
the hardest to control on the fir
ing line." He meant by this that
the Western volunteers could not
accustom themselves to remain
ing under cover when there v.as
an opportunity to charpe the en
emy and drive it from its posi
tion. This Is the highest possible
praise for the volunteer organi
zations, and is an excellent com
mentary upon the character and
flphtins proclivities of the West
ern volunteers.
A volunteer officer, now on duty with
his regiment at Manila, has written the
following letter to the Associated Pross:
MANILA. P. 1.. May B.â Until the ar
riv.-il of the last mail from home, the
volunteers in the Philippines were
ignorant that General Otis had informed
the War Department that they desired
to remain in the service so 'long as there
is fighting to do.- The dispatches to that
effect, as given out by Gei.eral Corbin.

feHlng In the volunteer ranks.
if they felt that their services were
really needed, the volunteers would stay
and fight to the end without a murmur.
Rut they do not believe that conditions
warrant their detention. Moreover, a
pronounced resentment exists among the
volunteer officers and men over the at
titude maintained toward them by Gen
eral Otis and the W;ir Department.
Before the beginning of an aggressive
campaign, it was freely given out in
Manila and Washington that General
Otis did not deem it expedient to attack
the insurgents with his volunteer force,
but would await the arrival of trajned
and seasoned regulars to put down the in
surrection. Six weeks of inactivity went
by in the best season of the year for
campaigning. When several regiments of
regulars at last arrived, they were put
into the field with regiments of volun
teers. It required less than a week for
the commanding generals to ascertain
that the volunteers could, and did, fight
all around the regulars, .with Infinitely

MANY VICTIMS OF
THE STORM.
Number of Killed and In
jured Runs Up Into
the Hundreds.
BURKHARDT, Wis. f June 13.â A messenger from New Rich
mond has just arrived and telegraphed to Hudson for doctors and
help, saying a storm struck the town last night and a large number
of people were killed and wounded. The railroad tried to get out a
special train, but was unable to do so on account of washouts. All
the available doctors and many other persons are now driving across
the country to New Richmond, being piloted by the messenger. The
killed and injured are believed to number between 200 and 500.
STTI.LWATER. Minn.. June 12.â
This was a terrible nipht for New
Richmond, the beautiful little vil
lage being: almost wiped out of
existence by one of the most severe
cyclones that ever visited the locality.
It carried ruin and death in its path,
and at this hour it is impossible to
give even a partial list of those who
are dead or seriously injured.
It Is thought many are dead. News
of the disaster was brought here by J.
A. Carroll, a traveling: man from Port
age, Wis., who was stopping at the
Nicollet House in New Richmond when
the cyclone struck the town. He saw
the funnel-shaped cloud as it came up
the principal street, and he took refuge
in the basement of the hotel, which was
completely wrecked. together with
every other business house in the city.
In the terrible sheets of rain follow
ing the cyclone Mr. Carroll and his
comrades succeeded in rescuing the
proprietor, Charles McKennon, his wife
and <me child from the debris, and they
also removed a laundry- girl, who was
bo seriously injured it is not thought
she could possibly live. They also re
moved two men named Barrett and
Newell, who were very seriously in
jured.
Mr. Carroll drove to Stillwater by
team for relief, and a train left with
doctors at 12:15 o'clock. Carroll fur
ther says that fire followed the cyclone
and what is left is being consumed by
llames. Many people are doubtless
killed and the damage will run into
hundreds of thousands of dollars.
MILWAUKEE. Wis.. June IS.â A dis
patch was received at 2 o'clock this
morning from Jewett Mills, announcing
the arrival there of the Wisconsin Cen
tral train. A. Mr. Cutter, in the em
ploy of the Central, sent Â» Â«JiÂ«pat<~j* to
the local offices of the road saying that
the town of New Richmond was gone
south of Highway bridge, and that the
estimated number of killed will reach
150.
Many of the houses, Mr. Cutter
states, were consumed by fire after the
cyclone. Many people were killed, he
says, white attending a circus which
was showing there.

about 5:30 p. m. It formed in a water

hundreds of people and seemed to fol

for the city, but about two miles south
it veered to the east and left the lake
and crossed the country.
It was about twenty rods wide and
destroyed everything in its track. The
first building struck was over on the
farm of F. C. Mattison. One edge of
the storm struck his buildings, twist
ing his barn out of shape and throw
ing his windmill some rods. It then
struck the Gridley farm. The family,
seeing it coming, fled for -a large stone
quarry about twenty rods from the
house, where they remained safely un

brick one and held to the foundation,
but the shingles were torn from the
roof. The cyclone veered to the north,
leaving the buildings unharmed but
tearing large oak trees three feet in

them into every conceivable shape.
About one-half mile northeast from

OUTRAGES IN IDAHO
Temporary Dismissal of Complaints
Against the County Commis
sioners and the Sheriff.
BY HON. PATRICK REDDY.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WALLACE, Idaho. June 12.â The
effort <>f the Governor, Sinclair
and other politicians to remove
the Sheriff and County Com-
missioners to-day failed. Judge
Stewart dismissed the proceedings
against them. The Attorney . General
immediately filed a new information
against Sheriff Young and the State's
attorneys promised to do likewise in
the Commissioners' cases. The" incar
ceration of the Commissioners is one of
the most dastardly acts yet perpetrated
by the Governor. There is no pretense
that they were in any way connected
with the recent riots, yet they were
thrown into the "bull pen" and kept
there simply because they would not
knuckle to Sinclair and the mine
owners.
A most pitiable story is that of
Mrs. Stewart, whose husband is con
fined in the "bull pen" because he
dared expose the inhuman practices
in vogue at the prison in his paper.
Mrs. Stewart has three small chil
dren, the youngest not yet four
months old. After the arrest of her
husband, the plucky woman con
tinued to issue the paper herself, set
ting the type and running the press.
Last Thursday a company of soldiers
accompanied by two of the Coroner's
deputies came to her place and in
formed her they had come to confis
cate her property so that she could
not publish the paper. They carried
away eighteen cases of type and all
the advertisements which were set
up. Mrs. Stewart was entirely de
pendent upon the paper for a living,
and is left destitute. That the white
troldkrs- <iÂ«y not r<Â»li.ob â  thÂ» -job - gi-rxra
them is evident by the remark of a
sergeant to Mrs. Stewart, who said
that while he had to obey orders, he
thought : the authorities were in
damned small business in sending a
company of cavalry to rob one poor
woman.
That the insanity of the prisoner
Johnson who was shot at by the negro
soldiers was caused by the outrageous
conduct of Coroner France is beyond
bright an<l cheerful furnishings are
most pleasing to the eye. State and
national colors are everywhere dis
played throughout the city.
The preliminary session will convene
at 10 o'clock this morning and Mayor
Harrison will lend the dignity of his
presence to the occasion, hut will dele
gate to some prominent Native Son the
pleasant duty of welcoming the fair
guests of the city. This evening there
will be a reception to the visiting dele
gates and to-morrow the Grand Parlor
will get to business.2
question. After he had been taken be
fore the Coroner's jury he told several
of his fellow prisoners that the Coroner
had threatened to hang him unless he
identified some of the men Imprisoned
as bÂ«ing among the rioters. After he
became insane these threats were up
permost in his mind and when he was
taken by the Coroner to the depot to
be transported to the asylum he
thought he was about to be hanged. In
an endeavor to escape that fate he
plunged into the river, where he was
fired upon at least three times. France
admits he ordered the soldiers to ftre,
but says he told them to fire high. Why
this intelligent and humane Coroner
and acting Sheriff ordered a soldier to
fire upon an Insane man is not known,
unless It was to save him from drown
ing. It is reported that while the bol
dier was firing a number of deputies
nnd so-call< j <l "scabs" standing on the
bridge cheered and urged him to shoot
better.
The Grand Jury ordered by the court
was returned to-day. The members
were all Belected and summoned by
1 "oroner France, who is an employe of
the Bunker Hill and Sullivan Company.
There is no more necessity for mar
tial law hf-re than there is in San
Francisco. General Merriam's charge
against the miners of this district is as
baseless as would havr> been a charge
against th.-> people of Chicago of par
ticipating in the Haymarket riot. The
action of the Governor, his representa
tive, Sinclair, the Bunker Hill Com
pany and othei*s acting with them in
maintaining martial law is a mere pre
tense under which they are trying and
I to crush the labor organizations
of this district. The acts of th.' Gov
ernor and his associates are an open
violation of the laws and a menace to
the liberties of tin* p. â  pie of this coun
try.
AN IDAHO GRAND
JURY SUMMONED
Judge Stewart Reviews the Circum
stances Leading Up to Mar
tial Law.
BY ASSOCIATED P^ESS.
WALLACE, Idaho, June 12.â
trials of some 300 prisoners who are ;
charged with complicity in the riots at
Wardner on April 29. when the Bunker
Hill and Sullivan Mill was blown up
with dynamite by a mob of 1000 min
ers and two men shot and killed, began
to-day in the State District Court,
Judge Stewart presiding.
The trouble which culminated in the
destruction of the Bunker Hill and Sul
livan property has been of long stand
ing. The miners' unions of the Coeur
d'Alene district have been very power
ful and for many years only union men
have been employed in the mines, ex
cepting the Bunker Hill and Sullivan
and the Last Chance mines at Ward
ner, which employed non-union men.
Great pressure had been brought to
bear, particularly on Bunker Hill and
Sullivan, and even threats had been
made to compel the owners to recognize i
the miners' union and to employ only j
union men. The Bunker Hill people
steadfastly refused to employ union
men.
On April 29 about 1000 men took pos
session of a train at Wallace and rode
to Wardner, where they blew up the
mill with dynamite, destroying prop
erty valued at $300,000. In order to pre
serve order and protect property, Gov
ernor Steunenberg of Idaho called upon !
me Federal Government lor troops, ana
within five days from the destruction
of the mill 500 United States troops
were in the Coeur d'Alene mining dis
trict under command of Brigadier Gen
eral Merrlam. Governor Steunenberg
declared martial law, which was en- j
forced by the Federal troops. In all
about 800 miners were arrested charged '
with complicity in the riot, but more
than half of these have been released.
Among those arrested were Sheriff
James D. Young of Shoehone County and !
County Commissioners Boyle and Stim
son.
The cases of the officials charged |
with aiding arid abetting the riot were
called in court to-day in the form of
impeachment proceedings.
The State was represented by Attor
ney General Hayes and Attorneys Bo
rah and Forney and the defense by
Hon. Patrick Reddy and Messrs. Jones
and Morphy.
Jones presented and argued a motion
to quash and strike from the records
the accusations against the defendants,
claiming that the citation to appear
had been issued in an illegal and irreg
ular manner.
This afternoon Judge Stewart grant
ed the motion to quash the indictment
against the County Commissioners,
Boyle and Stlmson, holding that Judge
Mayhew had no right to issue, a cita
tion to appear while holding court in
chambers. The prosecution then with
drew the information against Sheriff
Young. New informations were filed
in both cases. The statute requires five
days' notice to appear, so both cases
went over until next Monday with the
understanding that they might be
taken up earlier by consent of counsel.
The defense then endeavored to have
Young reinstated as Sheriff, but the
court would not hear them here.
The Grand Jury was then called and
Judge Stewart delivered his instruc
tions, which fill over eight typewritten
pages. He commented on the import
ance of their duty on the rights of all
men in court, stating that men have a
right to assemble or organize for law
ful purposes. Then he went minutely
into the law regarding conspiracy, riot,
unlawful assemblage, intimidation,
failure of officers to disperse riotous
gatherings, murder, destruction of
property and especially by explosives.

THROUGH TRAINS
NEXT DECEMBER
Date of the Sar>ta fe's Comple
tion to San praocisco
Delayed.
# LOS ANGELES, June 12.â The Santa Fe. will not begin the operation â¢
O of through trains between Los Angeles and San Francisco before late in 8
S December, and the indications are that the date may be delayed until Â£>
it early next January. General Passenger Agent John J. Byrne, who is 2?
O just home from the north, says that the San Joaquin road line cannot g
q be made ready for traffic before that time. Freight on the new line is #
S? now being handled as far as Stockton, but no attempt at passenger SS
business to and from way points and Los Angeles will be made. This
q mattei is in abeyance pending the arrival of President Ripley.
iS The Santa Fe and the Southern Pacific companies have jointly gg
? agreed to put Into effect a most liberal policy toward any big convention O
*-* which hereafter may be held in the. East. This innovation, so far as g
# Â« the Southern Pacific Company is concerned, is said to be due to the ef- jj
O forts of E. O. McCormiek, passenger traffic manager of the system, who Q
â¢_* has just assumed charge. g
5 The new idea has resulted in a $81 round-trip rate to the Christian j*
ft Endeavor convention to be held at Detroit on July 6 to 10. Tickets Q
6 good from any point in California will be honored, returning, until Au- gj
2 gust 31. The $76 rate to the Epworth League convention to be held at 2*
O Indianapolis in July is in line with the same liberal policy. i 3
which the Grand Jury was summoned
Judge Stewart said: "Your attention is
lally directed to the present order
of thing's in this county. I'nd<=>r the
proclamation of the Governor of this
State, dated May 3, this county is un
der martial law.
"The Governor recites in this procla
mation, among other things, 'that the
execution of process is frustrated and
defied by bodies of men and others;
that combinations of armed men resist
the execution of process and commit
deeds of violence.' "
Judge Stewart, continuing, said: "The
court is also advised through the press
and public rumor that on April 29 a
body of armed men came from Burke.
Mullan and other points in the county.
In charge of a train of cars, upon which
was carried gunpowder, or other ex
plosivea. proceeded toward Wardner.
where they were joined by others and
then proceeded to what is known as
the Bunker Hill and Sullivan mill,
where the same was exploded and great
damage done to property. John
Schmidt and James Cheyen were killed.
The truth or falsity of these matters
is especially referred to you for
thorough investigation."
The Judge then continued with an
explanation of the rights, privileges
and duties of grand jurors and their
relations to others. The Grand Jury
is made up almost exclusively of busi
ness irien from Wallace, Wardner and
Murray.
The trials of the miners will begin
as Boon as the cases of the county offi
cials are disposed of.

HUNDREDS INJURED
AT NEW RICHMOND
MILWAUKEE. Wis., June 12.â A
message was received at the Wisconsin
Central offices here late to-night from
Stevens Point, from A. R. Home, divi
sion superintendent of the Wisconsin
Central at that place, as follows:
"It commenced to rain on the St.
Paul division about 7 o'clock this even- |
ing and the wires went down west of I
Jewett Mills aiout 7:30. At 8:45 we got
a message from Robertson, the opera
tor, via Marshall, that a cyclone struck
New Richmond about 7:30, killing and
wounding from 250 to 800 people.
"We have started a special out from
Irvine, leaving at 10 o'clock with sur
geons and to pick up what other sur
geons they can between there and New ,
Richmond. Also sent section men from
Jewett Mills with what help they can
carry on their cars. I will leave here
on a special as soon as I can get crew
out and will take all assistance I can
get in way of surgeons. Am trying to
get St. Paul to start a special from that
end."
A second message from Mr. Home
reads:
"Party just came to Jewett Mills and
reports that Dr. Ware was killed and
Dr. Epley has both legs broken and
that they are much in need of doctors.
This received at 10 o'clock. Don't you
think we should start a special from
Milwaukee with nurses and surgenos?"
TRAINS ARE BLOCKED
BY THE WASHOUTS
ST. PAUL, June 12.â Owing to wash

being impossible to get through. The
Omaha is washed out near Hudson, the
Milwaukee and St. Paul has lost sev
frul bridges and considerable track
near Wabash, Minn., and in Wisconsin;
the Burlington is blocked by a washout
near Trempleau. Wis. The Wisconsin
Central line extends only beyond Still

|)f blocked places on the various branch
lines. The mail trains from the East
were unable to get through to-day,
owing to Sunday night's storm, and to
night's heavy rain and wind simply
increased the difficulties.
Locally the storm did much minor
damage. Over two inches of rain fell
in an hour's time and the wind blew a

WANTS TO MEET
JEFFRIES AGAIN
Fitzsimmons Is Looking
for Trouble.
MAY DEMAND RETURN MATCH
FOR THIS REASON HE WTLL NOT
ACCEPT A BENEFIT.
Noted Anatomist Pronounces the
New Champion the World's
Most Perfect Physical
Specimen.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, June 12.â 1n the area of
the Coney Island Sporting Club, In
which he won the championship of the
world from "Bob" Fitzsimmons. on
Friday night, James J. Jeffries to-night
boxed three rounds with "Jim" Daly,
his sparring partner. When the big
fellow climbed through the ropes and
seated himself in the corner which he
occupied when he fought Fitzsimmons,
5000 throats bellowed forth a welcome
that fairly shook the building. The
champion acknowledged the greeting
by bowing and smiling to all. He then
put on the gloves and sparred three
lively two-minute rounda, during which
he hit Daly'pretty hard, much to the
delight of the crowd.
Once or twice Daly landed on Jeffries
rather hard, and several individuals
shouted "Put him out, Daly." There
wore cries for a speech at the end of
the bout, and Jeffries, after consider
able urging, responded. Said he:
"Gentlemen, I thank you for your
kind applause, and I will do my best
to defend the championship."
"Bob" Fitzsimmons has declined to
accept Jeffries' offer of a benefit at the
Coney Island Sporting Club on Satur
day night. Martin Julian, manager of
the former champion, explained Fitz
simmons' declination as follows:
"Fitzsimmons is not in need of finan
cial assistance from any one at pres
ent; tht-n again, he is considering the
advisability of another match with
Jeffries. Were he to accept, a benefit
from Jeffries now it would place him in
a rather awkward position. In other
words, we do not think it would be con
sistent on Fitzsimmons' part to accept
a benefit from a man of whom he may
later demand a return match. FitEsim
mons appreciates the generous offer of
Jeffries, but he cannot accept it."
Jeffries has arranged to spar in the
following places during the week:
Hartford, to-morrow night; New Lon
don, Wednesday night; Providence,
Thursday night; Boston, Friday night.
One of the greatest anatomists in
America, or in the world, has examined
the new champion prizefighter. The
opportunity to bring the two men to
gether was afforded when Jeffries was
taken by hip manager to Philadelphia.
The anatomist who there examined
Jeffries Is Dr. T. Hollingsworth An
drews, who became well known the
country over at the time he was a
demonstrator of anatomy at the Jeffer
son Medical College, and who examined
more of the world's famous athletes
than any other surgeon In America. Of
comfortable means, he has retired from
active practice <>f his profession, though
the city of Philadelphia still retains
his services as surgeon of the Police
Department.
Every polieemiin on the Philadelphia
foree â and many of them are giants
has undergone a thorough physical ex
amination by Dr. Andrews. He has
scientifically examined 25,000 men. One
fad of the great anatomist for years
has been physical examination of the
world's great athletes, both in Europe
and America.
As a result of the examination he
has pronounced the new champion to
he to-day the most perfect physical
specimen In the â world. In the very
points where such men as John L.
Sullivan and Sandow have been weak,
Jeffries waÃ found to be strong. After
an examination lasting an hour, no
: physical defect was found.

NEW YORK, June 12.â The prospectus of a plan to buy the Muck
ross estate and the Lakes of Killarney by popular subscription by
Irish-Americans of Greater New York will be presented to-morrow to
those who have taken an active interest in the scheme. This Is pre
liminary to the public meeting at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel on
Wednesday night.
James J. Coogan, James S. Coleman, John T. Fitzgerald and James
Boothley Roche, who are working energetically on the scheme, were in
conference yesterday and formulated the plan for the purchase and
maintenance of the park property, which will be submitted at the public
meeting.
The idea of purchasing historic old Muckross and the adjacent wat
ers of Killarney for an Irish National Park has met hearty approval
among Irish-Americans fn this city. Scores of them have signified their
intention to subscribe, and it is believed that after Wednesday night's
meeting enough money will be pledged.
Reports from Killarney, whither Richard C*roker has gone, speak of
the interest manifested by the residents of County Kerry at the pros
pect of Killarney becoming a national garden spot.
Many men prominent in Tammany Hall are enthusiastic over the
scheme, and it has been suggested that meetings be held in every
Assembly district in the city to help it. It was said to-day that the
poorer classes was anxious to subscribe to the purchase fund and were
only awaiting the result of Wednesday night's meeting to learn the
proper way to contribute and to whom their subscriptions shall be sent.

Britons Favor the Scheme of Bring
ing England and Ireland Into
Closer Accord.
LONDON. June 12.â At a largely at
tended meeting of peers, commoners, en
gineers and others held this evening in
the House of Commons, a resolution was
adopted to address a petition to the First
Lord of the Treasury, Arthur J. Balfour
relative to the projected tunnel between
Ireland and England. The scheme is fa
vored on the ground that it would not
only unite England and Ireland more
closely, but tend to bring the United
States and the United Kingdom into more
Intimate accord.
The proposed route Is a distance of
twenty-five miles under eighty-five fath
oms of water, and the estimated cost of
the undertaking is Â£12,000.000 ($60,000,0u0).

better dash and spirit and greater endur
ance. The volunteers flanked and charg
ed the insurgents over rice fields and
across rivers, and killed, captured or
routed them, while the policy of the reg
ulars was to waste ammunition and time
hy exchanging volleys with them from
Impregnable breastworks.
The superior effectiveness of the volun
teer fighting was so evident that the field
forces then forward have consisted of vol
unteers almost exclusively, while regi
ments of regulars lay idle in their bar
racks. It has been a war by volunteers
and of marvelous success. But neither
the "War Department nor General Otis
has recognized it in a public manner in
a way that might soothe the feelings of
the volunteers for the constant evidences
of distrust, sometimes amounting to con
tempt,' manifested toward them previous
to the opportunity they had of proving
their worth. From the rank and file of
the regulars the volunteers receive their
full measure of praise. They attribute the
superiority of the volunteers here to the
experiences of their Western life. Foreign
military experts on the ground write in
the frank admission that the best army
of its size in the world to-day is the small
body of volunteers which has accom
plished in three months what Spain did
not achieve in 300 years.
However, the volunteers do not make a
life business to engage in war. They are
of the opinion that it is high time for
the regular forces to relieve them and
take up the work which they make their
profession. No regiment of volunteers in
the Philippines has been consulted re
specting its wishes to remain longer in
the service. General Otis sent the erro
neous information of their desire to stay
on his own initiative, with the apparent
purpose of pacifying the public mind In
the United States.
If President McKinley will order a poll
taken In the volunteer regiments the re
sult will be that not twenty to the regi
ment will vote in favor of remaining
longer, now that the regulars have ar
rived in force and are doing practically
nothing.

PARIS, June 12.â M. Oharron said to
day: "I am very much surprised at
the turn the proposed international au
tomobile match has taken. It promised
at the start to be a serious affair, but
apparently it has stopped off suddenly.
"Mr. "SVinton issued a challenge for
any amount. I took him up. fixed the
stakes at 100,000 francs and accepted
a.ll the conditions made by Mr. Winton.
I paid over to the Herald 20,000 francs
as a forfeit.
"I do hope the American sprrrtsmen
will understand this difference between
the terms 'stakes' and 'forffeit,' as 20,000
francs forfeit cannot and never could
be twisted into meaning 'stakes.'
"Having placed this 20,000 tranrs mr
feit in the hands of the Herald, Mr.
Winton does in a like manner, deposit
ing his 20,000 francs in the office of
a New York newspaper. But this proves
beyond any question that Mr. Wintr-n.
accepted the conditions I laid down
and which were published immediately
in the Herald.
"New York newspapers which have
taken up the interests of Mr. Winton
so much in this matter will sureiy find
money enough through their readers,
among whom will he femnd persons
who have confidence enough in Mr.
Winton and who will complete the sum
in his behalf which is fixed in my let
ter published in the Herald. But tht
whole sum should be placed with the
Herald, where my forfeit now lies, and
where I shall pay in the stakes.
"I may say that b .t far as I am con
cerned 100,000 francs was found in twen
ty-four hours. Just as srmn as Mr.
Winton finds an equal amount I Will
pay over to the Herald the full sum of
100,000 francs. I hopp Mr. Winton on
his part will do likewise."
AUTOMOBILES FOR
SANTA CLARA COUNTY
Line to Be Placed in Operation for
the Transportation of
Passengers.
SAN JOSE, June Vl.â Automobiles prom
ise to be an Important factor in settling
the various portions of Santa Clara Coun
ty and making San Jose a business center.
L. Lion & Sons have large land interests
at San Martin, eighteen miles south of
here, and they are contemplating putting
on two automobiles between this city and
San Martin. The firm owns over 5000 acres
there and It is proposed to cut them in
small tracts. Two of the firm will go
East in a few days and while there will
investigate automobiles. If they should
prove a success on the San Martin route
more Will be purchased amt the aulo
transportation scheme extended in all di
rections, taking in Campbell. I-os Gatos,
Milpitas. Mayneld, Mountain View and
Palo Alto. The expense of operation is
slight and from fifteen to eighteen miles
an hour or a little more could be made
on the fine roads of Santa Clara County.
This would furnish quick and cheap
transportation. Thousands of visitors
â would be attracted to San Jose by the
introduction of these machines and as the
routes would run through the prettiest
orchard districts of the county it would
advertise the county's resources.

COLUSA FARMER'S
WILL CONTESTED
Scramble for Henry C.
Nelson's Wealth.
PECULIAR POINTS INVOLVED
DISPUTED INSTRUMENT WAS
NOT SIGNED.
It Is Alleged the Dying Rancher Was
Unconscious When the Codi-
cil Was Drawn Up at
His Bedside.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
COLUSA. June 12.â The taking of testl- I
; mony In the contest of the will of Henry
C. Nelson, a wealthy farmer of Colusa !
County who died about a year and a half ;
ago. was begun to-day before a Jury. Th? !
| deposition of R. E. Smith, one of the cx
i ecutors. was read, and the testimony of
I E. J. Hill of San Francisco, one of the !
; subscribing witnesses and the lawyer who I
dictated the will, was taken in part.
From the opening statement of Crit
: tendon Thornton for the contestants and
the evidence already taken these allega
tions are gathered: Nelson was 79 years j
' old when he died. In July, 1897, he had j
a partial stroke of paralysis at his home \
â¢ near Colusa. In September following ho j
was taken to the Langham Hotel in San j
Francisco to be treated by Dr. Thomas I
Gal van, being at the time so helpless from |
his stroke and from sickness that he had i
to be carried on a chair. On the night of !
Oct. .her 16, after he had been there under ;
i treatment about a month, he had a sec- i
ond stroke of parlysls. He was not ex- !
pi cted to live until morning. He was at- I
tended by six of his relatives, nephews \
and nieces, who were the children of a !
d< i â  ased brother, ami who lived near him
in California. Early in the morning of i
; the 17th of October E. J. Hill, a lawyer
who resided In the hotel, was hastily
j railed, ami dictated a*will in accordance >
< with directions given to him. Hill was
; told there were only six heirs, and that
all the property was to to his heirs
at law. He hastily dictated the will and
Dr. Galvan wrote it. At the time Nelson
i was in an unconscious condition, having
' been placed in an invalids chair. His
head was thrown back, his eyes open and
staring, his mouth open and his law
dropped down. During the three-quarters
of an hour occupied in going through the
t form of making a will. Nelson made no
motion or any sign of intelligence, unless
I he squeezed the hand of Dr. Gnlvan when i
asked if the paper was his will, as he
! was requested to do if he. desired it to be
his will. He never spoke one word nor
gave any sitrn that he knew what was
going on about him: he was. in fact, un- :
': conscious at the time. The will left all
the estate to the six nephews and I
I who surrounded fiim. and made Dr. Gal
van, a stranger who had known Nelson
lees than thirty days, sole executor with
out bonds. There were, in fact, one sister
anil sixteen nephews and nieces living in :
the East.
It is claimed that Nelson was clearly at
the point of death at the time. The rela- !
tives had sent for an undertaker and hi?
had arrived before the will was made.
The Contestants propose to prove that the
relatives who were present were dissatis
; Bed with having I>r. Galvan sole executor
; without bonds unless some one of them
would be appointed ny Galvan to manage
I the estate. The mai'- relatives before the
death of Nelson and immediately aft. r
the will was made separately importuned
Galvan to make them managers, and
upon Gal van declining to do so they pro- !
cceded in great haste to procure the at-;
tendance or J. W. Goad, an attorney of
Cclusa, nnd T>r. Gray of Colusa, and on
their arrival on the evening of the 2flth
of i >,-t..i,,-. r had Mr. Goad draw up a codl
-1 cil to the will, adding himself nnd two â¢
I member? of the family n= additional ex
ecutors, but still leaving all the estate to !
| the California relative.
it is eiaime<i that Lawyer Hill took the
part he did only because Of The mlsrep
resentatlons made to him at the time, and
he is now here as a witness in behalf of
the contestants and uas told on the stand
Just how the will was brought about and
just how it was made and witnessed.
At the adjournment of court the ciues
t'.on of introducing evidence to prove the
jeint efforts or conspiracy of the Inter
ested parties to procure the making of
tt.< will and codicil was being argued and
this will be further argrierl to-morrow
n'orning. The contest promises to be a
very sensational one. The parties are all
inminent and nre ably represented by
counsel, there being no less than four law
yers on each side.
The defendants deny all that Is charged
pgainst them and say they can completely
refute all the testimony offered by the
( '-ntestants.
TWO SHIPS OF WAR"
UNFIT FOR SERVICE
Uncle Sam Found to Have Made a
Bad Bargain in Purchasing of
English Builders.
NEW YOKK. June 12.â A special to the
World from Washington pays: Naval px
perta have pronounced the cruisers Al
bany and New Orleans dangerously top
heavy. These two warships were pur- !
chased in England hy the Navy J")epart
ment just before war was declared With
Spain. The New Orleans was brought to
this country and was in service, but the i
Albany is still In the course of construe- :
tion. She was tied up in English waters \
by the laws of neutrality.
Rear Admiral Hichborn, chief of the
Bureau of Construction and Repair, to
day filed with the department the report ;
ol Naval Constructor Bowles, who In- j
specter] the New Orleans at the Brooklyn
navy yard and mad.' discoveries. This \
news is disappointing to the department, '.
a- the New Orleans, by reason of her!
good showing in Cuban waters, was looked
upon as a worthy ship. What is worse
the experts have no remedy to offer for ;
the defects.
The Albany Is at Armstrong's ship
yards in England and is advanced RO per
C< nt toward completion. The two ships
are built along exactly the same lines and j
what is true of one is true of the other.
Troubles of a Policeman.
MARIS\ILLE, June 12.â Police Officer
J. E. Parmelee, who on last Friday was
j convicted In Justice Aldrich's court of
i battery committed on a prisoner he had
j arrested, made application in the Su
perior Court t"-day for a writ of prohi
; l.iition restraining the Justice from pass-
Ing sentence. His contention was that
* Justice Aldrlch was usurping the powers
of Police Judge, who, he claims, should
have sole jurisdiction over offenses com
mitted within the. city limits. While the
court did not make a formal decision on
tho merits of the case, its rulings on a
demurrer offered by Aldrich's counsel to
Parmelee's complaint indicate that he
will permit the Justice Court to pass sen
tence. Friends of the man whom Par
melee battered have caused charges to be
filed with the Mayor and Council against
the officer. It Is thought Parmelee will
resign, as this is the second time, he has
been called upon to answer to a battery
complaint.

Pierson's famous asylum at Lindenhof,
near Dresden, for permanent residence,
the medical faculty and court doctors
having decided that she is weak minded

which followed.

THE PEACE CONFERENCE
AND PROBABLE CONFLICT
IN THE TRANSVAAL
Special Cable to The Call and the New York
Herald. Copyrighted, 1899, by James Gor
don Bennett.
THE HAGUE, June 12.â 1 ques
tioned a member of the Peace
Conference to-day as to what
would occur If during the confer-
ence England were to take up
arms against the Transvaal. His re
ply was:
"The question would be very difficult.
England would certainly contend that
I it -was her own business, the Transvaal
being a vassal and her action against
the Boers amounting to the simple
quelling of an internal insurrection or
rebellion. As, however, the Boers
maintain they are an Independent
power, the conference would certainly
I offer friendly intervention and propose
to act as arbiter."
The question is already being talked
'â  about in private conversation, the Eng
j lish delegates alleging that the Trans
i vaal matter is only a question between
! mother and child, but this would not
i ultimately prevent the Peace Confer-
I ence from believing it could not stand
aloof and witness a bloody struggle
silently without being ridiculous in the
eyes of the world."
1 had a long interview to-day with
| two eminent diplomats, members of
the Peace Conference. I gathered that
: the American proposal for rendering
\ private property inviolable at sea is
strongly supported by the Dutch dele
| gates and most of the other countries.
Germany, however, is indifferent.
! France strongly opposes it. She ap
pears to think that in case of war with
England, the possibility of which has
been shown by the Fashnda incident.
the American scheme would rob her of
i her principal weapon against England.
In case of a naval war it has always
' been the idea of the French to strike
1 on every pojnt of England's merchant
! marine and trade. They are not at all
willing to relinquish for the future
, what appears to them to be the best
chance against the nation that rules
the waves. It is quite certain also that
Russia supports the French view, es
pecially because she considers herself
bound in duty to back her ally.
The fate of the American proposal,
therefore, is very uncertain, although
Germany probably, in trie end, will be
found siding with the United States and
England, which may possibly turn the
scale.
At present the whole attention of the
conference is centered on the arbitra
tion question. It has falsely asserted
that the arbitration scheme, as dis
cussed, leaves arbitration optional. It
is made compulsory in twelve specified
cases, especially applying to interna
tional conflicts out of differences of con
tention regarding the meaning of treat
ies.
I have been able to read the Russian
proposition. It enacts that the con
ference will choose five powers to be
called upon to arbitrate. Each will ap
point a judge, five constituting a court,
to which two of each contending par
ties will be entitled to add a judge of
its own appointment with the same
right as the other Judges. A permanent
arbitration bureau, representing the
five original arbitrating powers will be
instituted, with headquarters at The
Hague, the expense to be borne by all
signatory powers in the same propor
tion as for the existing international
postofnee bureau.
CARS GUARDED

Scenes of Wild Disorder
at Cleveland.

CLEVELAND, Ohio, June 12.â The at
tempt of the Big Consolidated Railroad
| Comparty to move its cars was to-day at
i tended by scenes of wild disorder In vari-
I mis parts of the city, though nobody was
j hurt and very little damage done to prop
erty. Cars were run on two lines at very
Irregular intervals, but without passen
: gers and mainly under the protection of
policemen.
The principal work of the mobs, which
\ were composed largely of idlers and spec
tators, was to blockade the tracks, In
which they were materially assisted, by
accommodating drivers of trucks, to cut
trolley wires and jeer at non-union men.
Occasionally stones and pieces of mud
were thrown, but nobody, was hurt. The
strikers discouraged violence, but they
', did must effective duty in inducing the
non-union men to quit, and In this they
were assisted by several women, relatives
of the strikers, who hoarded the cars and
pleaded with the new men to leave their
positions. One of these women was pro
vided with money, and when argument
failed she induced th^ non-union men to
quit by paying them.
Many of the cars were left on the lines
deserted and were afterward picked up
by inspectors and taken to the terminus.
: The company says it has sufficient men to
1 operate its "cars to-morrow, but this is
! denied by the strikers.
The Important development of the day
was the refusal of the company to let the
.State Board arbitrate the only question
Involvedâ the recognition of the union,
i The strikers say they feel greatly en
'â â  couraged and that they will be better pre

TWO NEGROES LYNCHED
BY THEIR OWN RACE
Laborers at a Phosphate Mine Mete
Out Punishment to
Murderers.
I OCALA, Fla., June 12.â Two negroes
| were lynched at Dunnelon last night by
I a mob of their own color. Some weeks ago
j Ma'slia: Payne was shot by a negro. Sat
'â  urtiay the negro was captured and re
turned to Dunnelon, when it is supposed
some negroes were employed to take him
down the river and drown him. Sunday
evening the laborers of the Dunnelon
phosphate mine organized to mete out
similar justice to those implicated. They
succeeded in lynching two of the
men and were only prevented from lynch
ing others by Sheriff Nugent and an
armed posse, who went down on a special
i train from Ocala. The posse returned
this morning and reported everything
quiet.

GENERAL LORD WOLSELEY.
LONDON, June 12.â Comma
nder-in-Chief Lord Wolseley has
been busy for several days and
evenings at the War Office, pre
paring for possible eventualities
in South Africa. The effective
lists of the first-class reserve

ranged. The officers on furlough
have been warned to hold them
selves in readiness to return to
their regiments. The general
trend of news, however, is more
pacific.
On the other hand, it seems that Q.U

gestion of delaying for five years any

Reports.
Fpecial Plspatch to ThÂ» Can.
LOS ANGtELES. June 12.â A letter
to-day received by Dr. Victor Rendon
of this city from his brother, Pedro
Kendon, scouts the Idea that gold does
not exist in the Sierra Pintada placers
in Lower California. Rendon, who is
an attorney, gives instances where such
reports are contradicted by individual
experience. In his letter Rendon says:
i i;ir company has received \v<>rd from !
a man who was sent down to the Sierra
Pintada fields by us saying that P"H is
there In paying quantities. This man.
who is trustworthy, Informed us that his
son, twelve years old, got ?* in gold dust
in two hours' work with his own hands.
The dirt from which the $S was obtained
was dug and washed by the boy himself.
Some persons who have come back from
the placer fields, say that there is not -
enough gold there to work with profit. It
is generally believed here that those who
have brought back such reports are not c
miners of experience, but men who do not
know how to go at the work properly.
Again, some of them an 1 miners who
know their business but who do not want
the fields overcrowded with newcomers,
but want to profit for themselves. Some
men, in order to keep persons from go
ing down there, are only too willing to â 
spread discouraging reports.
The steamer Saint Denis hrought 492
ounces of gold dust to Knsenada on her ,
last trip. Some of this was consigned to
our company and some to E. Romers, a j
merchant of Ensenada.
Dr. Rendon, in explaining this, said
it was customary for some of the mm- j
ers to consign their dust to the com
pany, which paid them the standard
amount for all that was shipped to
them.
General Andrade, the Mexican Con- i
sul in this city, said that, in his opin- \
ion, the reports of Pedro Rendon could
be taken with as much confidence as
official reports.

RANCHERS' FEUD
ENDS IN DEATH
Parkfield Resident Slays
His Neighbor.
Fp^flal Dispatch to The- Call.
SALINAS, Juno 12.â John B. Jones, a
well-known farmer residing in the south
ern portion of Monterey County, was shot
and killed yesterday by his brother-in
law, James O. <iill<tt. The weapon used
was a Winchester ntie, and the first re
ports of the affair that reached this city
were to the effect that Gillett killed his
victim when the latter was a quarter of a
mile away and was not aware that his
life was in danger. This the slayer de
nies. He pave himself up to the authori
ties yesterday, a Hoping that he had taken
the life of Jones in pelf-defense. The
facts regarding the killing have not yet
In en hrought to light, and the widow of
the victim seems disposed to. aid her sis
ter, the wife of the homicide, to shield
Gillett.
Gillett and Jones courted and married
two sisters, daughters of William Murley,
a pioneer of this county. It has heen
known for years that the two men were
hitter enemies, and the wife of Jones, to
avoid trouble with her brother-in-law,
persuaded her husband to leave the Park
lield district. They came to this section
and lived near Santa Rita. Later, how
ever, Jones moved to Tuolumne County,
where up to about three weeks ago he re
sided.
Moving back to Parkfield, Jones took
property adjoining the ranch of his
biother"-in-law and just across a creek.
The old feud which had slumbered broke
out afresh on Sunday. At some place in
the mountains the moa met to adjust their
difficulties amicably. They failed to ar
rive at a settlement, and once more parted
enemies. Jones rode homeward and Gil
lf-tt to his abode. The latter remained
only long enough to procure his ritle, and
then started out to Turd Jones. When the
two men met, according to the statement
s-f Gillett. the quarrel was renewed, and
to avoid being killed himself Gillett shot
fust. Jones fell from his horse and ex
pired almost immediately. When he saw
his relative fail Gillett went to Parkfield
and surrendered to Constable Sloan to
avoid possible violence from friends of
Jones.
T'pon reaching the scene of the murder
the officers could find no trace of any
weapons carried ny Jones, but It is
claimed they discovered a place in the
brush where there were evidences of some
one having been In hiding.
The whole affair Is creating no end of
excitement, and at the inquest to-morrow
and the preliminary examination on.
W ednesday it is expected there will be
ser.sationai developments. The friends of
Jor.es claim he was shot when riding un
armed up a lonely mountain trail, and
they threaten to avenge his death. The
families involved in the feud are among
the most prominent in Southern Monterey
County, where they have resided for many
years.

WAGING WAR ON
SUNDAY CONCERTS
Reform Attempted at
Sacramento.
CHURCH-GOERS ARE DIVIDED
MANY NOT IN SYMPATHY WITH
THE MOVE.
Bey. Mr. Miel of St. Paul's Declares
in Favor of the Sabbath Even
ing Recreation Acorded
thÂ« Populace.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, June 12.â For a number !
of years past one of the chief amusements
of the public of Sacramento during the
summer months has been the open-air j
concerts at the plaza, and the most pop- |
ular of these concerts have been those j
held on Sunday evenings. Now and then i
there has been expressed some opposition !
to these concerts on the part of certain
churches, but they were held from year
to year nevertheless, and continued to
grow steadily in public favor. Not until
this year has the antagonism assumed
importance, and there is prospect for j
some lively times before music in its j
voluptuous swell again floats through the ]
plaza palm branches while church bells i
are tinkling on the evening breeze.
Last night Rev. S. J. Carroll, pastor of j
the Sixth-street Methodist Church, dcliv- !
ered a sermon in which he denounced the
Sunday evening concerts as promoters of
immorality and as inimical to the
i churches. He protested against the ap
i propriatlon of public funds to aid them
and at the conclusion of his address a
series of resolutions were adopted by the
congregation calling upon the Board of
Trustees to refuse the use of the public
plaza for the concerts.
Stubborn as is the opposition on the part
of Rev. Mr. Carroll and his congregation,
it is not shared apparently by all the
| churchgoers of the city. Yesterday a peti
! tion was sent to each of the churches for
I the signatures of those naembers who
were willing to protest agaifst the Sunday
night concerts. St. Paul's Episcopal
Church is one of the largest and most in
fluential religious organizations in Sacra
mento. At three separate services yester
day the rector. Rev. C. L. Miel. presented
the petition, remarking that while per
sonally in favor of the Sunday evening
concerts, he believed that the members
of his congregation should have the op
portunity to express their individual
views. As a result of the presentation nf
the petition at these three services only
one signature was obtained.
To-night Rev. C. L. .Miel in an interview
I in the Bee asserts nis belief that the of
i fersea of which the opponents of the con
; certs complained could not be regulated
! by legislation or by other method than the
i exercise of parental authority. He asserts
that he has on several occasions, after his
r\ < ning service, attended the concerts at
the plaza and found there well-behaved
assemblages of people, who seemed to be
enjoying the music and the fresh air. Rev.
Mr. Miel gives utterances to these inter
esting remarks:
"I do not think that statute law should
ever bÂ° substituted for the great law of
fieedom of conscience. It may be, as
si.me predict, that this country is becom-
In a corrupt country, that its people are
becoming an indifferent. Godless people. I
do not share this view, but if it be true it
is not because its papers are printed on
Sunday; not because its boats and trains
are not locked in their docks or sheds by
order of the legislature on Sunday; not
IS4 the wnrkingman is allowed to
become for a few hoOrs a resting man on
Sunday, but because so many Christians
are selfish, narrow, little people; because
so many prefer pleasure to duty, and gain
to honor; btrcttuse co muny love their
party more than their church, their
church more than Christianity, their per
sonal opinions more than the truth, and
themselves more than all else besides.
"Those are the things that corrupt and
rot a nation. But the honest labor and
its reward and modicino, the proper,
wholesome recreation of its citizensâ these
arc not the things that corrupt or rot a
nation."
A delegation of local clergyman ap
peared before the City Trustees to-night
and urged that body not to appropriate
money for the Sunday concerts, nor t>> al
low the use of tlio Plaza for the purpose.
The board allowed th>- concert commit
tee to use the Plaza during the summer
months, without designating the days,
and appropriated $150 with the provision
that it should be usM only for mid
week concerts. This arrangement is
satisfactory to the committee, which ex
pects to raise enough money by popular
subscription for the Sunday night events.
LANDMANN'S SLAYER"
IS YET UNDISCOVERED
PARTICIPANTS IN THE MELEE
GIVE TESTIMONY.
Their Statements Conflict and the Po
lice Are in the Dark â Detective
Cody Seeks a Witness.
George F. True-worthy. James Mnnahan,
Frank Bush and William Sampson, the
young men who were engaged in the row
on Sunday evening which resulted in the
death of John Landmann, were taken be
fore the Chief of Police yesterday ami
each gave his version of the fight, as was
told in The Call of Monday morning.
Their statements conflicted, each prison
er making an effort to shield the other
from blame. The only Important state
ment made was that of young Monahan,
who still sticks to the assertion that he
gave the knife to "Hunkers" Trueworthy.
Trueworthy was shown the knife found
after the struggle and swore that he bad
never seen it before. The police kre of
the opinion that the weapon used in the
affray was secreted immediately after the
killing of Landmann. According to True
worthy, he and Rush were mixed up with
Landmann at different times during the
fight. It will therefore be impossible to
ascertain who was the knife-wielder.
Several other witnesses to the affair
were examined, but information of little
value was elicited. Detective Charles
Cody is energetically working on the
case. He is looking for a witness who
has not as yet come forward. The young
men are still in prison. They will ap
pear at the Coroner's inquest this morn
ing and may tell what they know of
Landmann's death.
LIGHTNING TRANSFORMATION.
Farmer John Hickey Meets a Bunko
Man and Now Wears Old Clothes.
Johy Hickey, a middle-aged man who
has just arrived from the country, ran
athwart a Clever bunko man yesterday
and last night he went to police head
quarters with his troubles. Hickey, who
had been drinking all morning, met a
stranger in a saloon at the corner of Clay
and Polk streets, and together they
started out to see the sights. The affable
stranger told Hickey he was a brother of
a prominent officer of the First California
Volunteers. They had many drinks to
gether and the liquor soon began to over
power Hickey. The stranger suggested
that he hire a room in a lodging house at
1522 Polk street.
Both men went to the room and when
Hickey woke up about 5:30 last evening
he found that the stranger had relieved
him of $45 and some small change and his
new suit- of clothes. The bunko man was
thoughtful enough to leave Hickey his
discarded suit, and as Hickey was a much
bigger man than the bunko-steerer, he
presented a sorry appearance when he
walked into police headquarters last
night to report the matter.
Yacht Club Property Sold.
SAN RAFAEL, June 12.â The property

SOON TO START
FOR THE ISTHMUS
Canal Commission Not
Disposed to Delay.
ITS WORK TO BE HURRIED
WILL REPORT TO CONGRESS BY
JANUARY 1.
Civil Engineer Haupt to Lose His
Place Unless He Disavows
Interviews Credited
to Him.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Headquarters, Wellington Hotel,
Washington, June 12.
Admiral Walker, chairman of the
new Nicaraguan Canal Commission,
has called a meeting of the commis
sion for next Thursday, June 15, when,
it Is expected, the question whether
the Commissioners shall proceed at
once to Central America and begin the
work in hand, or delay until the yel
low fever season has passed, will be
decided. It is believed the start from
New York will be made by July 1, or
before. It is said the commission will
endeavor to finish its work in time to
report to Congress by January 1 next.
Unless Civil Engineer Lewis Haupt
disavows the authenticity of published
views credited to him, his resignation
as a member of the Isthmian Commis
sion will be asked for and the vacancy
filled by the appointment of another
engineer. Notice has been taken by
the President of the interview with Mr.
Haupt, and it has been called to his
attention with the request that he at
once Inform the President of its cor
rectness.
This action is due to the earnest de
sire of the Chief Executive that a com
mission shall be organized which will
make a fair and impartial investigation
and submit an unbiased report. If Mr.
Haupt is already classed in favor of the
Nicaragua canal, as the statements at
tributed to him would seem to show
and so strongly opposed to the Panama
waterway, it is apparent that his re
tention on the commission, now that
his views are known to the adminis
tration and the public generally would
injure the value of its report. For this
reason the President has been con
strained To ask Mr. Haupt for an ex
planation.
The friends of Mr. Haupt here are
confident that the views attributed to
hirr. nre substantially correct, as it is
said he has talked in much ihe same
way to them. His removal from the
commission will mean a distinct loss
to the Nicaragua element, in view of
his Nicaraguan canal attitude.

land, if he is not recaptured before he has !
the opportunity to slay.
The story of his appearance Sunday in
the*'Potrero. as published in yesterday's
Call, coupled with the knowledge that his
mania is only for blood, had the effect of .
causing intense excitement in that thickly- .
populated district. The prospect that the
madman might suddenly appear at any
home and kill the first one he met was not j
one to be ignored. Some few of the j
stronger-minded scouted the idea that j
Cheesman had been seen at all in the Po- |
trero, but his presence, revolver and all,
had been reported to Knickand his wife.
That they believed the report was shown
by their action in summoning the police
and in the fact that yesterday, while his
wife kept most of the time to a darkened
inner room, Knick, the handle of a re
volver showing plainly from his back i
pocket, stood guard inside the door lead- !
U.B from the hallway. 'â  - <â¢"*
Knlck plainly showed the tension on his
nerves caused by the responsibility newly i
devolved upon him of defending his men
aced bride and his rented castle from the :
approaches of the enemy. He believed
the report of Cheesman's presence in the
vicinity from an experience himself and
wife had had in the early hours of Satur
day morning.
"My wife was awakened," he said,
"about i o'clock Saturday morning by a
â  noise In the room adjoining our bedroom.
She aroused me and I listened until I
heard what sounded like some person
bumping against a chair. I got out of
bed in a hurry and started to go Into the
next room, which was- dark. I stopped
and picked up the lamp, which was
lighted, and took my revolver. Then i
pushed open the door suddenly and rushed
to the middle of the room to dodge any
plow that might be aimed at me.
"In an instant I saw there was no one
in the room, but I was convinced that
there had been from the noises both of us
had heard and from the fact that one of
the windows, both of which had been
closed when we retired, was up. I was a
little bit dazed for a moment at the idea
that some one had entered our rooms and
I went out of the window and onto the
piazza, but could Bee no trace of any one.
The door which opens from it to the hall
which communicates with the stairs,
leading to the street below, was unlocked
and I suspect now that whoever made the
early morning call upon us had gained
access to the window and made his es
cape that way. â _â -.-:
"As I as examining the door I saw
a man walking along the other side of
the street and I asked him to go to the
police station "ii Twentieth street and
notify the officers there that a man had
tried' to break into our place. Upon my
return to my wife, who had heard of
-man's escape from the asylum, she
insisted that he was the intruder. Since
I heard of his presence in this vicinity I

am strong in the belief that she was
right. I am prepared for him."
The Knicks had a call yesterday from
Franklin S. Oheesman, father of the es
i aped murderer Ilia i *~\"p a.t tho <3o<>r wcui
answered from the other side by Knick,
who was cautious about opening.
"Who'u there?*' he asked.
'â¢It's Howard. " came the reply through
loor, ami while Knick did not recog
nise the voice he was confident that it
was not thai of his wife's pursuer. He
let the visitor in and soon discovered his
identity. The elder Cheesman sought to
make the Knirks believe that his son was !
nut In the country, telling them, as he had
told a Call reporter Sunday, that he be
lieved Frank was in th<- Kast with a rich
uncle. He appeared to have no other ob
ject for his visit but this, and his Btay
was short.
During the afternoon Mrs. Knick and i
Mrs. Schultze stepped out to look at a
flat, the fears of the young women hav
ing filled her with a desire to move. They
1 at the police Station and so in
formed Lieutenant Anderson, but upon
their return both Knick and his bride
denied that they contemplated any such
proceeding, the husband saying they felt
where they wore with his revolver
and a watchdog they had secured. If
they do intend to move, as the police were
informed, they wish to do so so secrety
that Cheesman will be in ignorance of
thi ir whereabouts for a long enough time
to allow of his recapture.
Lieutenant Anderson made an attempt
yesterday to find some trace of Cheesman,
but his men were unsuccessful, none of
them believing that the sanguinary luna
tic had been anywhere in the vicinity, ex
cept in the highly excitable imagination
of Mrs. Knick.
The entire police force of Oakland was
at work on the Belden mystery yesterday,
but not a single clew has been developed.
Although an organized lookout has been
kept for Cheesman, the police are not at
all sure he was the man who wielded the
ax in Mr. Beiden'a doorway on Saturday
night.
"We have not landed anything that can
solve that affair," said Detective Hodg
kins to-night. "It is a plausible theory
that Cheesman may be the man we want,
but I am not inclined to let it i-est at that.
There are many reasons why it might not
have been Cheesman. It hardly seems
reasonable that robbery could have been
the object, for no robber would attempt
such clumsy work. Had murder by a nor
mally minded man been the purpose it
would appear that he would have engaged
Mr P.elden In conversation and then have
â â  struck the blow that might have been
fatal. It certainly appears like the act of
a lunatic unless there is something be
hind It of which we are not aware."

WELLS-FARGO
MEETS WITH
A SETBACK
May Yet Have to Pay
Its War Tax.
ATTORNEY GENERAL WINS
STATE COURTS MUST PASS ON"
TEST CASE.
- -
Judge Morrow Grants Ford's Motion
to Send It Back Despite the
Efforts of Defendant's
Counsel.
"vV>lls-Fargo's Express Company re
ceived a material setback in its persistent
efforts to evade its share of the burden
imposed by the war revenue tax and
: shoulder it upon its patrons when Judge
Morrow of the United States Circuit Court
ordered the hearing of the case instituted
by former Attorney General Fitzgerald
: back to the State courts for hearing.
The facts of the case are these: A few
months prior to his retirement from office
; Attorney General Fitzgerald caused to be
tendered Wells, Fargo & Co. in this city
a package for shipment to Sacramento,
I the expressage on which amounted to 25
I cents. That sum was proffered together
with the parcel, but the company's agents
\ refused to accept it without the payment
I of 1 cent additional to cover the revenue
tariff. In October last the Attorney Gen
i eral applied to the State Supreme Court
â  for a writ of mandate commanding the
i company to ship the package without de
manding 1 payment of the 1 cent additional.
j The Supreme Court, however, held that
; it could not take cognizance of the matter
'. : and the Attorney General then went be
| fore the Superior Court of this city and
â  ; secured the issuance of an alternative
: writ ordering the express company to for
', ', ward the package or show just cause why
[ ; it should not be compelled to.
; Before the time set for the hearing of
â¢ j the order the express company. Instead of
: appearing, tiled an answer and a petition
' I asking to have the .matter transferred to
The United States a Power for Good.
A distinguished historian writes, while re
ferring to this nation's advent as a colonizing
power, that we represent the "century's polit
ical conscience," and that our influence for
good over European spheres will be Immense.
This result was Just as inevitable as is the
cure which follows the use of Hostetter's
Stomach Bitters, the great remedy which Is
fr,und in every home and drug .store through
out the country. It cures indigestion, constipa
tion, overworked kidney and liver, allays nerv
ousness, and tones up the whole y.ystt-m.

the United States Circuit Court on two
groundsâ first that the State court was
disqualified because the Attorney General
waa a resident of this State, -while wells,
Fargo & Co. was a Colorado concern; and
second, because a Federal question was
Involved.
That was the status of the case when
Tirey L. Ford succeeded Fitzgerald as
Attorney General. As soon as Mr. Ford ,
could examine into the case he found ;
that although it had been transferred to
the Circuit Court the record had not been !
transmitted. Mr. Ford finally secured the |
transfer of the record, and as soon as this |
was done he moved to have the case !
transferred to the State court. This mo
tion was filed in April, and it would have
been heard on May 1, but that day was a
legal holiday, and Judge Morrow did not ;
call the law and motion calendar again
until June 5. At that time the counsel for
Wells, Fargo & Co. asked to have the j
hearing go over for a week, and the re- j
quest was granted.

Attorney General Ford argued that the
Federal "court had. no jurisdiction because
it was a mandamus proceeding and tne
Federal courts have- no jurisdiction ever
snch proceedings unless they he in , aia ,Â£ r
a jurisdiction previously acquired by tne
Federal courts. In this case the sole pur
pose waa to secure a writ of mandamus
commanding the defendant to forward the
package in question, and hence the writ
was an original writ and not in aid of
any other action or proceeding.
Counsel for defendant argued that the
facts disclosed by the petition did not
entitle the petitioner to a writ of man
date but rather to an injunction if any
thing and that the Federal court had
ample jurisdiction over injunction mat
ters. Counsel cited a long array of au
thorities, but failed to convince the court
of the correctness of his position. Ho
then asked for time to file a written' brief
and cite additional authorities, but to this
the Attorney General objected and the
court then remanded the cause to the
State court.

ALICE. HARRY
The pangs of misprized love, feeding
upon a disposition prone to melancholia,
drove Alice L. Miller, a domestic in the
employ of Mrs. Hannah Ross, to an early
suicidal death. Returning late Sunday
night after a day's surcease from work.
Miss Miller retired to her room at 426*4
Grove street, and ended her nineteen
y*ars of life by turning on a gas jet. She
was weary of the disappointments that
come from a one-sided love affair and de
libf-rately determined to end all.
Many letters written by the love
wracked girl and found in her room ex
pose the secret reason of her taking off.
The man back of it is Harry Kelly, a car
conductor on the Fillmore-street line, who
had known Miss Miller for the last six
months. About a month ago their friend
ship was brought to a sudden end. Since
The Fair Suicide and the Mm Who Rejected Her.
that time the deceased spoke repeatedly
of Â«the shallows of life and her desire to
â¢"fee herself from its burden.
"he body of the suicide was discovered
terday morning by Mrs. Ross. As she
a knocking at Miss Miller's door to
, aken her she smelled the heavy, nau
. eating odor of gas. Calling her husband
;;t the same time she entered the room.
Stretched out on the floor, her face rest
ing on the carpet, was the body of the
domestic whom Mrs. Rosa had Intended
10 summon to her work. The young girl
was completely dressed, with the excep
tion of her shoes, which were lying on the
floor. The tip of the gas jet had been re
moved and the gas wan buzzing full force
when the. Rosses entered the room.
It was a very late hour Sunday when
Miss Miller returned to her home. She
had been gone the entire day and the fact
that she was out after 11 o'clock was no
ticed by Mrs. Ross. At midnight Mrs.
Ross saw the light burning in her ser
vant's room and she went In there to
speak with her. The latter was sitting on
the edge of the bed. writing a letter. To
Mrs. Ross she made complaint of the bit
terness of life and said she did not care to j
live. She burst into tears and confessed I
that it was all over with her hopeful af- i
fection for Harry Kelly. According to her j
story she had met Kelly ttiat afternoon
and â â .ilkrd â with him on the street. On
her l<-rom she wore a pin m which was
lilfi picture. He asked her for it, but she
refused to give it up. He obtained mok
session of the picture, however, and it Is I
this incident which she refers to in the
last letter she wrote. It is as follows:
Dear Harry: I parted with you. but you |
know that i said I would not part with :
your picture only In death
You can blame yourself for the Rood-by.
You have no right to take that pin.
Harry Kelly, when seen yesterday, was
at his post, tallying fares. "She always
said she- didn't care to live," he said. "I
hav^ known her about six months, but
have had nothing to do with her for the
lrst month or more. I feared ' that she
| was not thoroughly sane, so 1 left her.
Fes, I suppose she was In love with me."
Kelly admits that he met the deceased a
: few days ago.
The letters written at various times
: within the last month disclose a deliber
ate Intention to end her earthly existence.
i The following was evidently penned after
the quarrel:
Forpive me

so 1 thought it about time to end it all.

I done.

The following letter is to Mrs. Ross, In
whose home deceased was employed:

Well. 1 am about to die. so good-bye.
I loved Harry too dearly to live without
him and you know I did Well. I thank you
for your kindness to me and wish you luck.
'â¢ i â¢â¢"â  Good-bye.
On the back of an unaddreseed letter
the -writer asks for information about a
brother who is spoken of as an inmate
in an asylum. Miss Miller has several
aunts and uncles living In this city.
LIFE HELD NO
JOYS FOR HER.
OAKLAND, June 12.â After frequent
threats that she would commit suicide
and while in a fit of despondency over im
apinary love troubles. Miss Alien Marquet.
aped 19 years, this morning swallowed two
ounces of carbolic acid to make good her
threats and end her troubles.
The young woman had been residing at
the residence of her uncle, Captain .1
Morrison, 65S Jackson street, acting as his
housekeeper, for the past six years, while
her mother. Mrs. Campania. lives at
Temescal. She had not been in tin- best
of health for the past few days, suffering
considerably from headaches.
Shortly before S o'clock Miss Marquet
left her home to secure postage stamps
for two letters she had just previously
written. One of these letters whs ad
dressed to Harry Troy, a saloon-keeper
on Battery street. San Francisco, with
whom she had been keeping company. It
is presumed that she also secured the
poison at a neighboring drugstore and on
returning to her homo she. Immediately
quaffed the deadly stuff and sank down
on the bark stairs, where her groans at
tracted the attention of her friend, Miss
Mildred Herspring of 21ft Second street.
who had just called. Horror-stricken,
Herspring asked her friend what
sh.e had dune. "This Is my last act "
answered the dying young woman
"Please send for mother." Then her head
dropped and she became unconscious.
Miss Marquet was promptly removed to
the Reviving Hospital, where Dr. Strat
lon and Steward Borchert applied the
stomach pump and relieved her of about
two ounce? of pure carbolic acid. Anti
dotes were immediately applied and dur
ing the afternoon the hospital physician
expressed some hopes that her life' might
be saved. Her lips, mouth and throat are
terriMy burned.
It is supposed by some that Miss Mar
rjuet's rash act was prompted through
disappointment in a love affair. Neigh
bors, however, believe that nervous head
aches nearly drove her marl mid that she
did not know what she whs doing. Yet
according to a statement by her Bister!
who called at the luispit.il later in the
day. Alice had frequently threatened to
end her life.
A man. supposed to be Harry Troy but
who emphatically declined to disclose his
name, also railed at the hospital. He
stated that he .had been in the girls com
pany on Sunday afternoon and at tlmt
time she was in pood spirits. "We had no
quarrels that 1 can think of," said the
stranger, "but Alice said a week ago that

but 1 did not learn what about. Her uncle
always treated her kindlyâ more 80, In

Mrs. Campania the girl's mother, la

cide by swallowing a dose of car
bolic acid some time yesterday at

cide was not known until about 8 o'clock
last ni?ht, when T. F. Holz, a roomer in
the house, returned and found the body
of his landlady half reclining on a little
cot in a rear room. A strong odor of acid
pervaded the apartm?nt and a wineglass
lying on the floor by the side of the cot
still held a drop or two of the poison. A
two-ounce bottle containing half an ounce
of the acid stood on the sewing machine
near by.
On a table in the kitchen were a few
fragments of a letter which the woman
had written and then destroyed. The let
ter was unfinished. It read:
"Love, do not feel broken-hearted. Mv
father died for me and I die for my boy."
An envelope had also been addressed -to
Mrs. Eisett, Hayes street, near Lagunu,
and then destroyed.
The dead woman was the wife of Peter
Haiick, an ex-policeman, but the couple
separated about a year ago and since that
time Mrs. Haucfc has been earning a liv
ing for herself and her 13-year-old bo.y
working as a domestic. About three
weeks ago Holz, who had known her for
some time, furnished the Octavla-street
house for her and she started in business
as a dressmaker, yesterday morning i-hc
was feeling downcast and told Holz i hut
when she thought of her past she felt like
taking her life. He urged her not to gel
discouraged, and wh>n h>' left her she ap
peared to have recovered her spirits arid
he had no idea she would put her implied
threat into execution. But she had evi
dently begun preparations to put an end
to her troubles almost immediately, for
when he nHurncd at night she had been
dead for several hours.
Holz at once notified the police and the
Coroner's office and the body was remov
ed to the Morgue. BTolz was taken to the
City Prison and detained as a witness.
Mrs. Hauck is said to have been well con
nected in the Bast, but, so far as known,
had no relatives on the coast. Her son
is boarding with friends in this city. The
inquest will be held to-day.

FOR, LICENSE COLLECTOR.
Commissioners Meet and Take Three
Ballots, but Fail to Make a
Selection.
Mayor Fhelan, Auditor "Wells and
Treasurer Truman mot yesterday morn
ins for the purpose of electing a License
Collector to succeed Theodore F. Bonnet,
the incumbent; but after taking
three ballots without arriving at a choice
they adjourned to meet again to-day.
Auditor Wells voted for William Z. Tiff
any, Treasurer Truman cast his ballot for
Frederick W. Lees and the Mayor voted
for Bonnet.
It is expected that at the meeting to

Republican members of the Board of Su
pervisors. So far Auditor Wells has
kept his promise to the public that ho

place.

RAILROAD SANDLOTISM.
THE evening organ of the railroad and sandW
combination on Saturday last was in an
of vulgar enjoyment. It clapped its
kicked up its heels, threw sand in every direc
nd literally reveled in its diversified infatua-
Railroad proletarianism could scarcely have
tore vividly illustrated. Its recent tears must
temporarily allayed and it must have been
i that the wave of righteous indignation that
overwhelmed it- corrupt representatives in the Board
( i Supervisors and in other quarters had subsided.
The favorite character of the railroad impressed
upon its newspaper apencies is that of a bully. When
the people n>>e in indignation at the obtru-i<>n of
Han Hums as Mr. Huntingdon's candidate for the
Federal Senatorship. they were promptly slapped in
c. The same course was pursued when the
Market Street Railway <. ompany directed its munici
pal subordinates to donate t-> it in one bunch what
ever easements and privileges San Francisco still re
tained, ror a Â»hort time, however, the emblematical
warning of hemp stilled this sandlot clamor in the
chamber of the Supervisors and a violent demand
mporarily reduced to a comparatively modest
solicitation.
' 'â  Saturday last, however, the original instinct for
I dictation, developed by incessant practice for
a generation, reasserted its controlling power over
the sandloted monopoly. It roared and lied and
shook it- fists and beat the air until it produced one
of the old-fashioned "tempests in a teapot." It did
1 omparatively decent lying about Judge Bur
nett s decision that the Yrooman act is unconstitu
tional and only perverted that ruling into an
imaginary objection to the new charter. But, on the
"corkscrew" franchise, it outdid itself. This com
munity had supposed tbat the attempted resuscita
abandoned franchises on Geary street, between
Taylor and Grant avenue, through an application for
il privileges was designed to forestall the ter
mination of the cable franchise under which the
Geary-street railway is now operated p.nd to deprive
the public of a possible boulevard. It had also been
proclaimed that this part of the associated villainies
had been abandoned. But the evening mouthpiece
of the railway emitted a blast upon this subject that
was enough to deafen all the jackasses in town. It
not only declared tbat the '"corkscrew" should pull
the municipal cork out of Geary street, amidst the
clamations of "property-owners, merchants and
citizens," thus reduced to unassimilating groups, but
.- .signed as a reason that from Taylor street to
Grant avenue is four blocks and that, under the law,
a competing railway could occupy the tracks for five.
The particular competing railway referred to is the
Geary-street cable line, of which the Market Street
Railway Company owns 60 per cent of thfe capital
ck, as it also owns the tracks on Market street
for seven blocks from the intersection of Kcarny
â  to the city front.
tt is apparent that the crushed spirit of the mon
opoly is reviving and that it actually deludes itself
with the belief that the public suppose the Market
Street Railway Company and tl^e Geary Street Rail
way Company to be competitors, that an auction sale
cf the new franchises within the twists of the "cork
-1 rew" would attract more than one bidder, and that
the protest of the Merchants' Association is a forgery.

ARE EXPRESS COMPANIES ABOVE
THE LAW?
THE CALL early and repeatedly has referred
to the illegal and unpatriotic attempt, of Wells,
Fargo & Co. to compel its patrons to bear the
cost of the internal revenue stamps, temporarily
exacted by the Federal Government on packages
transmitted by express, under an act of Congress
passed to raise extraordinary revenue during the war
with Spain.
The propriety and the validity of the law were be
yond dispute. Nor has there ever been any serious
question that the infinitesimal tax was due from com
mon carriers, engaged in the business of transporting
packages, and not from their customers. The lan
guage of the act is plain and any other construction
of its terms would be absurd. As we have frequently
observed also such judicial decisions as have been
actually rendered have .almost uniformly sustained the
views we have expressed.
The united action of the press has produced some
effect even upon so hardened, tho\tgh so recent, a
sinner as Wells, Fargo & Co. Press bundles are
forwarded without the imposition of the burthen of
the internal revenue charge. In other directions also
the express corporation has yielded to the sugges
tions of policy. But it has only ''stooped to con
quer." Practically and essentially it defies the law
and the government in the most inexcusable forms in
which such defiance can be expressed or acted.
Inspired and governed by the identical policy that
Mr. Huntington invariably applies in his railroad
management, in respect t<"> litigation pending as we
understand the fact both in State and Federal courts,
it has adopted the Fabian tactics of delay. An au
thoritative and final decision could have been easily
and promptly obtained if Well?, Fargo & Co. had
acted in good faith and upon business rules which
merchants and other ordinary citizens recognize.
Rut it has successfully managed indefinitely to post
pone a result that it knows to be inevitable, and,
while we do not suppose that the courts aided the
plan of procrastination, certainly their acquiescence
has facilitated a practice of pilfering that is equally
condemned by statutory law and by the moral code.
While Congress and the executive department of
the Government, so to speak, are "held up" by Wells,
Fargo & Co., it continues, with a multitude of dis
criminations that in themselves are a wholesale in
fraction of the rule of absolute equality applicable
to common carriers, to transfer every possible cent
of internal revenue stamp expenditure from itself to
the public. It exceeds even this measure of iniquity,
for it favors or punishes individuals according to
their independence or their submissiveness. A study
of the grain rate schedule lately ratified by the obse
quious Railway Commission, where large reductions
are made in places from which no grain is shipped
and the centers of grain production, away from rail
road competition, plundered, will convey a fair idea
of the tyrannous contempt for law that Wells, Fargo
& Co. shares with Mr. Huntington.
The most perfect illustration of equality before the
law that can be derived from textbooks and from au
thorities iÂ« its application to common carriers, which
deal with large numbers of people of every class, oc
cupation and business. Discrimination by common
carriers, especially when exercised arbitrarily and
from motives of mere cupidity or revenge, is insup
portable under a free and stable government. Yet
this is the rule that for thirty years Mr. Huntington
has imposed upon this State and which Wells, Fargo
& Co. is now tenaciously enforcing. The relations
between this corporation and the people for forty
years or ninrc were substantially harmonious. It is
unfortunate that they are now so rudely and so un
necessarily disturbed.
We insist that the courts move with reasonable
celerity in the revenue stamp litigation and end the
delay which covers persistent robbery. All citizens,
moreover, who respect themselves and the laws to the
making of which they have contributed, should stand
upon their rights and refuse to yield to illegal and
unconscionable exactions.
A good beginning was made yesterday in the Cir
cuit Court of the United States when, upon the ap
plication of Attorney General Ford, Judge Morrow
sent back to the Superior Court the petition for a
mandamus filed by Attorney General Fitzgerald to
compel Wells, Fargo & Co. to stamp and transmit
a package deposited in .order to make a test case.
This is a substantial victory that should be vigorously
followed up.
THE VROOMAN ACT
IN The Call of April 9, 1899, the decision of the
Supreme Court of the United States in the case of
the Village of Norwood vs. Baker was referred to
as being of far-reaching importance in its application
to street improvements. At that time we pointed out
the fact that our own Supreme Court had merci
fully held that on that kind of work nothing more
than the land itself could be confiscated, and that,
where the value of a lot was insufficient to pay the
assessment, there could be no judgment against the
owner for the deficiency, but that in the Village of
Norwood vs. Baker, upon grounds arising under the
Federal constitution, the intelligible rule had been
established that no recovery against property-owners
for a street improvement could be had unless the re
sulting benefits substantially covered the assessment,
or under a statute which did not provide for an in
quiry into the fact.
Since that article was written, in the case of Peta
luma Paving Company vs. Singley et al., Judge Bur
nett, one of the Superior Judges of Sonoma County,
upon the authority of the decision above mentioned,
has declared the Vrooman act of 1885, as subsequently
amended, to be unconstitutional, on the ground that
it authorizes the expense of street improvements to be
levied upon adjoining lots by the front foot and with
out reference to benefits. The judgment will have to
stand the test of the Supreme Court of this State, but
the full opinion of Judge Burnett has been published
and it very strongly supports his conclusion. The
Vrooman act has been considered by our Supreme
Court in numerous rases and upheld against at
tacks upon its constitutionality arising under particu
lar sections of the State constitution, and for a num
ber of years it has been the established law of this
State. But in the case of Davies vs. the City of Los
Angeles (86 California Reports, pp. 57-58), where the
statute of 1889, providing specially for the opening,
widening and closing of streets, which for these pur
poses was modeled upon the Vrooman act, was un
der fire, Chief Justice Beatty, in his concurring
opinion, declared that statute unconstitutional be
cause "it permits assessments upon the property sup
posed to be benefited in excess of the benefits." The
learned Chief Justice thus anticipated the decision
upon which Judge Burnett has founded his important
ruling..
The principle upon which adjoining property
owners have been forced to pay for improvements
upon unaccepted streets and, within specified districts,
the cost of opening or widening streets, is that the
work enhanced the value of their lots to a degree that
substantially corresponded with or surpassed the
{ amount of the assessments. It is manifest that this
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, JUNE 13, 1899.
principle is obliterated and arbitrary confiscation,
substituted when the question of benefits is ignored.
It is now settled that State legislation that produces
this result is directly in violation of article XIV, sec
tion i, of the amendments to the Federal constitution,
which inhibits the States from depriving any person
of his property without due process of law.
Many decisions throughout the United States toler
ating the appropriation of city lots for the benefit of
speculators and contractors, and some of them, after
a lien has been exhausted, going so far as to justify
personal judgments for deficiencies against property
owners, have been wiped out of existence by the
just and salutary ruling of the Supreme Court of the
United States. The fate of Judge Burnett's decision
will be awaited with great interest. It is sincerely to
be hoped that several recent decisions upon which
The Call has commented, and which are clearly for
the public welfare, and rest upon propositions that
are as intelligible to the ordinary citizen as to the
bar and to the bench, may be allowed to exercise their
full weight and influence and that they may not be
emasculated through the subtlety or the ingenuity of
corporations or street improvement rings.-
ANOTHER IMPERIALIST CRITIC.
r\ NOTHER correspondent raises an issue about
/ \ the occupancy of the Philippines. He appears
to believe that we began the war on Spain, not
to right the wrongs of the people whom she op- '
pressed, and whose aspirations for independence and
self-government she had denied and defeated, but for
the purpose of conquest and that "forcible annexa
tion,"' which President McKinley denounces as
''criminal aggression."
We need not repeat that this policy was expressly
disavowed by Congress and the President, in the
declaration of war. Nothing has occurred since to
make necessary the repudiation of our solemn pledge
against conquest.
Our latest critic uses the island of Panay and Span
ish occupancy of Iloilo to develop the imperialist
principle of conquest and the spoils of war, as an ex
cuse for practicing "criminal aggression," where we
had promised the Cubans, Porto Ricans and Fili
â¢pinos, and pledged the world, that we would appear
only as a good Samaritan.
Now as to the facts about Luzon and Panay.
Luzon was entirely in the hands of an organized na
tive government, except Manila 'and a narrow zone
around the bay, when Dewey went there. The na
tives closely invested Manila and Spanish sovereignty
extended no farther from the water's edge and the
walls of the city than a rifle shot. It is doubtful if
Montij o had in all the Spanish fleet a gunner who
could have hit the island, unless by accident. If the
doctrine of the spoils of war is to prevail, the Filipinos
have the best title to Luzon, because they were born
there, they own the land and by force had ended
Spanish jurisdiction over most of it without any help
from us. There was the same situation in Panay.
The Spanish held only the capital. Iloilo, the natives
had taken all the rest away. After we had forced
Spain to treat for peace, the natives continued their
investment of Iloilo and finally forced the Spanish
General Rios, to surrender to them, which he did.
Our flag was not there when the Mag of Spain was
hauled down. We had no military nor naval force
there. The Spanish surrender to the natives made
them, by the laws of war, the sovereigns of Panay.
They made the conquest, forced the surrender and
ended Spanish jurisdiction, themselves, with no help
from us. Panay was theirs before our flag went there.
As sovereignty passed over to them they proceeded
to exercise it. Many Europeans were in Iloilo, the
' owners of property and managers of business enter
prises. The native government was a civilized gov
ernment, able to protect and enforce the rights of per
son and property. It performed its public, govern
mental functions so well that business proceeded and
: life went on, with good order and no single case of
: violated rights. Not a dollar's worth of property was
destroyed nor was any one restrained of freedom.
We know of no way in which to prove that Spain
had sovereignty to sell in Panay. If she did, then I
England has some for sale in the United States, and
can dispose of it to a syndicate of nations, which may
throw their navies upon our coasts and begin' bom
bardment of our cities and blockade of our harbors,
without any declaration of war or demand upon us to
surrender. They can appear simply as the owners of
what they have paid for, just as the United States
appeared at Iloilo, and can do as they please with us,
provided we are unable to resist them.
All of Panay remained under the undisputed sover
eignty of the native government until the army and
navy of the United States appeared before Iloilo with
the Spanish deed to the island. General Miller was
in command of the whole expedition, but his subordi
nate, the naval officer in command of the ships, with
out notice to Miller, sent a flag ashore to notify the
foreign Consuls and residents tljat if the city did not
surrender he would wait twenty-four hours and then
shell it. He hardly waited for the return of his mes
senger, but began shelling the town within two hours
of his notice. At the moment his bombardment
began General Miller, his superior and commander
in-chief, was in his cabin on the Newport arranging
with three commissioners representing the native
government of Panay, for our peaceful occupation of
the island. The beginning of the shelling ended the
conference and the commissioners were detained on
board. Much has been said about the Filipinos vio
lating the laws of war and disregarding a flag of
truce, but we doubt whether they have ever been
guilty of anything as flagrant as the shelling and de
struction of Panay. Foreign residents lost millions
oi dollars in property and in due time our taxpayers
at home will have to pay the losses, when the claims
I are proved and put in the hands of their respective
governments.
It appears then that on May 9, 1898, Iloilo was in
possession of Spain. It was garrisoned by that sov
ereign power. It was not in the hands of the natives
at that date. But it finally surrendered to them and
not to us. If there are to be no differences on facts,
we hope pur critic will notice these facts and reconcile
our shelling of Iloilo with our declaration of war
against Spain, or with any right of conquest we may
I hold as against her, or with any title acquired by pur
chase of her sovereignty in Panay, which she had
parted with by surrender to. the natives before the
treaty of Paris had been ratified by either Govern
ment, and, therefore, did not have what she pretended
to sell and we pretended to buy. We can buy exactly
] the same title to Venice from Austria, or to Alasace-
Lorraine from France, or to the Netherlands from
j Spain, that she sold us to Panay and to ninety-nine
I hundredths of the area of the Philippine archipelago.
In their efforts to hit upon an acceptable arbitra
tion scheme the delegates to the Czar's Peace Con
ference made one fatal mistake. They submitted too
many drafts. That would explain the numerous
cases of cold feet.
William F. Herrin has again shuffled the cards and
the Railroad Commission has dealt the farmers of the
State a new grain rate schedule. Who will find the
'joker" in the pack'
WANT THE MAYOR
TO BEGIN AN
INVESTIGATION
A Complaint Against
Contractors.
WORK ON HALL OF JUSTICE
SUPERVISOR HOLLAND ACTS
FOR ANGRY CITIZENS.
Preparing to Wipe Out the City's In
debtedness for the Fiscal Year
Just Drawing to a
Close.
At the meeting of the Board of Super
visors held yesterday afternoon Super
visor Holland Introduced a resolution
calling the attention of the Mayor and
the members of the hoard to the numer
ous delays In the completion of the con
tract for the construction of the Hall of
Justice buildirrg, and also to the alleged
discrimination that has been practiced
against that portion of the city lying east
Of Kearny street and north of California,
The resolution is as follows:
Whereas, In the completion of the con
tract with Bateman Bros, to erect the Hall
of Justice and Morgue buildings- it is ap
parent from the delays that have and are
now being .had in the prosecution of the
work, that the building will not be com
pleted by the first day of July, 1899; and
Whereas, The contract was awarded on
December 3. 1896, although the same was
only executed by his Honor. James P. Phe
lan, on January 8, 1597, after he assumed
the duties of Mayor of this city and coun
ty, and by reason of repeated delays, ex
tensions of time were granted on one pre
text or another until July 1. 1599, to finish
and complete said contract; and
Whereas, The owners of the contiguous
property and in that portion of the city
have been subjected to great loss, damage
and inconvenience by reason of said delay;
therefore,
Resolved, That the attention of his Honor
tli.- Mayor and ex-offlcio president of this
board la railed to the provisions of faH
contract, and to the dilatory action of the
contractors, and he is hereby requested to
Investigate and report in writing to this
hoard, recommending such action as will
protect the city"* interest and be a sim
ple act of justice to the property owners in
that pe-tion of the city.
Resolved. That his Honor the Maror"s at
tention is railed to this fact; that this por
ti"n of the <-ity formerly its commercial
center has. through apathy find neglect of
thÂ« city authorities fur many years been
entirely overlooked, having badly paved
streets, and through the subsidence of the
roadways below the grade, has induced the
property owners to come to the conclusion
that it results from a concerted plan to
cause a depreciation of their property
thrnigh ulterior motives, as permanent
pavements have been laid at the public ex
pense In other portions of the city, whieji
from their condition did not demand an ex
penditure of the public moneys to the same
extent as the streets lying east of Kearny
street In the flfty-vara survey.
Resolved, That In addition to the want of
modern improvements, the property owners
are and have been debarred from obtaining
permission to use electricity as the. motive
power to Insure rapid transit to all portions
of this section of the city by the street
railroads having a franchise on the streets,
without just cause, for reasons which ran
not be defended, even if plausibly made, to
which his Honor the Mayor's attention Is
called.
Resolved. That the Imperative necessities
of improving the streets, etc., In the district
lying east of Kearny street and of affording
the opportunities to the owners of property
to rent or improve their property as their
business Interests require, jÂ« a paramount
consideration and requires the representa
tive of the city and county to observe in
the matter of street pavements the obliga
tions of the statute, that when a street is
accepted, thereafter It shall be kept,
open and Improved at the expense of the.
city nnd county, and not to Impose a further
burden upon the property owners; that be
fore a modern pavement shall be laid
the property owners fronting on any ac
cepted block or crossing shall pay one-half
of the expense, which is c/intrary to the
letter and spirit of the law, and the said
cobble and other pavements on the streets
are allowed to remain, to the utter discom
fort, loss and damage to property owners,
whereas, in the interest of the taxpayers,
the funds which could be so use,l are de
voted to other schemes wholly unauthorized
by law. and in this way, with official sanc
tion, they absorb the money which could
be applied to this purpose, to which his
Honor the Mayor's attention Is also
called.
The resolution was referred to the City
and County Attorney for his opinion as to
what steps should bo taken in the matter.
The following resolution from tht- Fi
nance Committee was read and adopted
and will he of Interest to merchants and
other creditors of the city:
Resolved, That the several appropriations
made by order No. 141 (second series) in
the general and special fee funds, regulat
ing and designating the limit of expen
ditures of the various offices and depart
ments for the fiscal year ending June JO,
1809, and by resolutions No. 2573 and 2421
(fourth series) making a
of the several appropriations be and they
are hereby suspended and set aside (ex
cept the sum of $55,000 for furnlÃhlns and
properly equipping the Hall of Justice
building and the further sum of $40,000 for
the construction of a police station) so as
to enable the Auditor and Treasurer to
respectively audit and pay the demands
on said general and special fee fund as
may be allowed and ordered paid by this
board out of said general and special fee
fund, to avoid any indebtedness being car
ried over at the expiration of the fiscal
year. It being the dpsire and Intention of
this board with the aid of the Auditor and
Treasurer to prevent the city and county
from repudiating its Just obligations to
merchantÃ and other creditors for merchan
dise furnished or for lahor performed for
the city and county; the statutory salaries
of the city and county officers being, under
the decision of the Supreme Court, a con
tinuing liability which. Irrespective of the
year the services were performed, must
i/e met and provided for.
The board voted to indefinitely post
pone the resolution granting permission
for the alteration and repair of the prem
ises at the corner of Pacific and Stockton
streets. The promoters of the "Hotel
N'ymphia" scheme proposed to alter the
premises and convert the buildings Into a
Slace of 111-repute. Father Caraher, Rev.
Ir. I'rmy ana others addressed the board
in opposition to the scheme.
Consideration of the resolution for the
repeal of the order prohibiting the selling
of pools and the making of books on race
tracks within the limits of the city and
county was indefinitely postponed by a
unanimous vote. The same course was
purÃued in the case of the proposed or
der excepting coursing parks from the
provisions of the race track order.

ANOTHER CALL CRITIC
To the Editor of The Call: I read with
much interest the very able letter in your
issue of the 6th inst. about the "Call and
Expansion" and your reply thereto. You
say that "all of the Philippines, except a
few localities on Manila Bay, were occu
pied by the natives, who had wrested
them from Spain before our flap went
there," etc. Under date of May 9, IS9B.
you say under the heading- of "There Is
More Work for Dewey" the followirg:
"Acting Admiral Dewey. the conqueror of
Manila, still has considerable work to per
form before the destruction of Spanish
power in the Far East is complete. Iloilo,
the capital of the Island of Panay. which
is fortified and garrisoned by Spanish
troops, remains to be taken, and there are
one or two point? in the Philippines which
the guns of his fleet will be called on to
reduce."
Now. our flag had been there nine days,
and before it went there, say on the 30th
of April. IS9S. Iloilo was not in the hands
of the natives, and it la not a locality of
Manila Bay. Seeing there can be no dif
ferences on facts, will you kindly publish
and explain? Yours respectfully,
WILLIAM STILL.

Captain George Ankers was not drowned
from Long Wharf. Oakland. For several
months his wife and family have mourned
him for dead, but three days ago a well
known shipmaster met him in Portland
and had a long conversation with him.
Ankers said he was not coming back' to
San Francisco until he had earned enough
money to make good the amount he was
short in the accounts of the schooner
Oceania Vance. In th" meantime his
wife Is making a brave struggle in Mill
Valley to support her children.
Captain Ankers was formerly master of
the Ala (I company's steamer San Juan.
hut during one voyage she went aground
and according to a rule of the company
Ankers lost his command. He Was then
made master of The schooner Oceania
Vance and made several trips to Hawaii
in hr-r. On his last voyage the vessel
went to Oakland to discharge. Captain
Ankers had been to the office of the own
ers on his arrival and the next day was
to settle Up his accounts. That night he
â¢ rossed over on the ferry and had dinner
on the steamer with some friends. He had
not been heard from until a friend of his
ran across him in Portland.
The general supposition was that Ank
ers had fallen overboard and been
drowned. A reward of $50 was offered for
his remains and for weeks men dragged
in the vicinity of the wharf in hopes of
earning the money. His wife hoped
against hope that he would be heard
from, but finally came to the conclusion
that he was dead and set herself to the
task of providing for her family. The
amount Ankers was short in his accounts
was not very great and the chances are
that had he made a clean breast of it to
his owners they would have given him a
chance to retrieve himself. He told his
friend in Portland that he would secure a
position as mate on some vessel and try
to work his way back into his old posi
tion.
I The Italian bark Stefano Razeto was on
fire in Sydney harbor yesterday, but was
not greatly damaged. She left here on
March 9 with 758.406 feet of lumber and
some general cargo, the whole being val
ued at $98,159. She arrived at Sydney, N.
S. \V., on May 31; and the supposition is
that the fire broke out in the general
cargo.
The steam schooner Celia Is on her way
back to San Francisco after an absence
of three years. She was formerly engaged
in the coasting and lumber trade, but was
chartered to some mine owners for use
on the Mexican coast. She is coming herÂ»
I for an overhauling and Is bringing up a
cargo of cedar logs.
The steamer Noyo took away for Fort
Bragg yesterday a party of campers that
expects to do great things in the way of
hunting and fishing. They are Eric and
Alfred Rosenstirn, Clifford Cook and W.
Scoofy. With them went three horses, a
wagon, half a dozen hunting dogs and

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, JUNE 13. 1899.
MAYOR PHELAN`S
CAMPAIGN FOR
MOTHER TERM
Activ.iy on the Line of
Supporters.
THOSE NEW SUPERVISORS
â¢
SUGGESTION THAT THE MAYOR
SHALL NAME NOMINEES.
Once He Named a Board So Bad
That He Had to Demand Its
Expulsion From
Office.
It is generally accepted as a fact that
the committee of seven appointed by
the General Committee of One Hun
dred Democrats will report a scheme of
apportionment that will give the small
est subdivisions of Assembly districts
represented in the nominating conven
tion. There is no longer talk of a blan
ket ticket and the Lawrence scheme for
reducing the General Committee to
twenty-five has gone glimmering.
While Buckley is doing some quiet
but effective work in Hub organization
throughout the city he is not putting
a straw in the way of Mayor Phelan's
renomination. The friends at Phelar.
assert that the Mayor's renomination is
already assured. He is getting many
Democratic club indorsements and it is
plain to the observer that the resolu
tions of indorsement emanate from a
central point. There is an occasional
variation. For instancy, over on Stock
ton street the pure-minded Demc-crats
in one long respiration indorse Mayor.
Phelan and denounce the Twinkling
Star Improvement Company and the
Hotel Nymphia.
Phelan's friends are so confident of
his success that they are demanding
that he should be permitted to name
his own Board of Supervisors. If this
demand is urged there will be trouble
in the Democratic party. It is called to
mind by Democrats that the preroga
tive of naming the Supervisors was
once conferred upon Mr. Phelan, and
that such a horrible bad job was made
by him in the selection that he had to
join Deacon Fitch and the courts in
efforts to expel the selected from
<>fii< I-. Phelan may know a good Mayor
when he sees one in shadow or sub

Can Get No Damages.
The .Justice* of the Supreme Court do
not think that George Davis, house
mcVer. has any claim for damages against
tht Pacific Telephone rind Telegraph Com
pany. In 1WÂ»1 the housemovers of San
Francisco came to the conclusion that the
telephone people had no right to make
them pay for the changing of their wires
and lines when It was necessary to move
! houses In the city. A number formed an
1 association and decided to make a con
test of the mutter and In due time the
company van notiiio.l of their Intentions^
Dnv;s cut the lines attached to a house on

RADGER BADLY BEATEN.
J. Blals, a barber at 36 Sixth street,
and L. Heidlngcr. his assistant, appeared
before Judge Graham yesterday to an
swer to a charge of battery. The com
plaining witness was J. Badger, a barber
at 26V4 Sixth street, who until a few
months ago worked for Blais.
From the evidence it appeared that
Heidinger told Blals that Badger was
bragging about having taken Lena,
Blais beautiful daughter, who is not yet
OUt of her teens, to a saloon. June 1 Blaia
sent word to Badger that he wanted to
Be* him in his shop and Badger crossed
over. He was taken to a rear room and
Blais asked him if he had said that he
had taken Lena to a saloon, and he de
nied it. He said he had invited her to
dine with him. but she did not keep the
appointment. This did not satisfy Blais.
and with Heldlnger's assistance he gave
Badger a terrific beating, blackening his
eyes.
Lena was in court and denied that she
was ever in a saloon with Badger, but
admitted that he had asked her to dine
with him. The Judge convicted the two
defendants and ordered them to appear
for sentence this morning.

OFFICIALS OF
HEALTH BOARD
WILL DIE HARD
Bring Su t to Enjoin
Their Dismissal. .
FIFTEEN ARE PLAINTIFFS
CLAIM THEY ARE STATUTORY
OFFICERS.
If Their Contention Is Upheld They
Will Continue to Hold Office
for Several Months to
Come.
It se*ms that the large majority of pub
lic officials appointed during the last ad
ministration have found their positions
quite desirable, and in conseouenre when
dismissal confronts them they have deter
mined to dl*> hard. Stilt was ftled yester
day by fifteen under officials In the Health
Office to enjoin tho new hoard from dis
pensing with their services and appointing
others to fill the vacancies.
The plaintiffs In the action are: Otto
Lunders. health inspector; Thomas II
McOrath, health inspector; P. F. Ward,
plumbing inspector; J. J. Dunne, secre
tary; J. (TKane. superintendent of city
cemeteries; Benjamin Davis, chief market
inspector; William Finnigan, health in
spector; James \V. Crowe health inspec
tor: J. W. ORourke, veterinary surgeon;
James F. Lahane'y, food Inspector; J. J.
Sullivan, chief plumbing inspector; J. L.
David, health inspector; T. Donovan,
health Inspector; A. R. Happersberger.
superintendent of dislnterrrtents and in
spector of vaults, and W. H. Harrison,
Inspector of garbage and transportation.
The new Board of Health, through fin al
leged threat to dispose of all the plain
tiffs named are made defendants in the
action. On' the filing of the complaint
Judge Dalngerfieki issuer] an order to
show cause, directing the defendants to
appear on the 23d inst. and show cause
why they should not be restrained from
dismissing the plaintiffs named.
Plaintiffs hold that they are statutory
officers and hold for four years after their
appointment. A majority of the plain
tiffs were appointed in the latter months
of the year ISPS, and in consequence if the
court holds they are statutory officers
have several months yet to serve. Dunne
& McPlke represent the anxious officials
and will wagf their right in the courts
against any attempt to remove them be
fore the time fixed by law has expired.
FOR A FULL TERM.
County Officials Bring Their Action
, Against the Charter.
Action on behalf of Sheriff Martin,
County Clerk I 'Pane and Recorder Ber
thler against the Election Commissioners
to enjoin the defendants from placing the
offices held by the plaintiffs on the elec
tion proclamation and ballots was file.l
yesterday by Attorney George D. Col
lins. The complaint was' filed after the
commission had passed a resolution re
-1 fusing to comply with the demand of tUe
. officials and strike off the offices named.
In the complaint It is first set forth
that the plaintiffs were regularly elected
to the offices which they now hold and
were elected for a stated term of years,
; and hence their removal before such pe
riod has expired would be in direct con
j flict with the constitution, an invasion of
; and an infringement upon the sovereignty
i of the State, a revolutionary usurpation
1 of power and In violation of the law en-
I titled "An act to establish a uniform
system of county and township govern
ments." approved April 1. 1K97.
It Is said in the complaint that the ac
tion is not designed to Impeach the valid
ity of the charter but to protect and gain
for the plaintiff officials their rights un
der the law. In conclusion an injunction
is asked for, as stated.
CONTRIBUTION BOX BOBBED.
Burglars Enter St Paul's Catholic
Church.
The contribution box of St. Paul's
Catholic Church on Twenty-ninth and
Church streets was robbed yesterday
morning at an early hour. The box had
bren placed in the old church to receive
donations to the new edifice being erected,
and it is supposed that the thieves se
cured about $60. The money was in en
velopes superscribed with the names of
the donors, and the finding of a number
of these envelopes in a vacant lot near
by led to the discovery of the theft. De
tective Dillon and Fitzgerald were nut
on the* case, but have been unable to nnd
a clew to the thieves.

EASTERN MARKETS.
NKW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK. June 12.â There was evidence
of large buying: by powerful financial interests
In a limited number of stocks anil of manipula
tion to advance : licet in the stock market to
day. Speculation otherwise was in a some
what quiescent state. Outside of the special
capes where prices were support ed the busi
ness done was rather heavy. Many of the rail
roads ranged downward within the limits of a
point during the early trading. There was an
organized buying throughout the- day of Fed
eral Steel, which was marked up nearly 3 [
points and closed almost at the top. There was
some sentimental effect by this on other steel
ftorks. American Steel and Wire responding
late in Uie day on covering by shorts, but
none of the gains in the group were well held
outside of Federal Steel. The so-called Flower
stocks were all well supported and Brooklyn
Transit shared Its strength with Metropolitan
Street Railway and Manhattan. This group of
New York traction stocks showed the effects
of realizing from time, to time during the day
a â '. Mnnho-Kon wo. djn aa nj below la.-t night's
close by its weight. The grangers were taken
up at one time, St. Paul in the lead, but did
not retain ail of the gain and In some In-
Ms-nces more than lost it. The coalers were
pretty well sustained also. Other points of .
ft- gth were Chicago Terminal preferred.
Denver and Rio Grande Issues and the newly
itsued Wisconsin Central stocks. Sugar fluc
tuated up and down during the whole day. but I
always above Saturday's level. It rose at one i
time 3 points, but lost it all before the cl se.
There was no evidence of outside demand
to koep the market up and the railroad group
showed Itself affected by. the heavy tone of the
foreign Stock Exchanges, on account of political
disquietude. The announcement of the resig
nation of ' the French Ministry helped the late
Traction in prices. The engagement of an ad
ditional S2,fiOO.Ono of gold for export to-morrow,
although the probability of it had been Inti
mated, also weighed on the market. No effect
was apparent in the money market, which con
tinued decidedly easy. Exchange also, though '
It hardened a shade, continues a broad fraction
below the point where experts can figure a
profit on gold exports. It Is, in fact, generally
admitted that the gold movement is due to thÂ»
actual buying of gold In this market to re
plenish the reserve of the Hank of England and
probably also Cor Russian purposes. This is a
precisely similar operation to that undertaken
by the United States Government through a
syndicate to replenish the gold in the Treasury
during the last administration. It is to be
noted that while the foreign money markets
are thus drawing on New York for gold as the
mo.n available source New York banks are
offering special inducements, such as paying
the exprcssage on bills remitted by Interior
correspondents, to secure a supply of legal
tender notes to meet the demand of active
business

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
j CHICAGO, June 12.â The effect of the un-
I expectedly bullish Government crop report
given out Saturday was apparent at the open
ing in wheat, but It was Boon shown that
| other influences had superseded it in the minds
lof speculators. The opening in July ranged
I all the way from 76 5 i77c, compared with
, Saturday's closing price of 75 l /4C. It sold at
I once at 76>4c, but rallied almost immediately
to 76!feC. But in this little spasm of nervous
, ness was dissipated all the effect of the Gov
i ernment report. The selling was heavy on the
bulge. Commission houses were ' in the mar
ket with big lots. For a short time the mar
ket held up under the liquidation, but finally
; broke, 76% c being touched nerore any reaction
; occurred. Heavy flour sales reported from
the Northwest caused a cessation of liquidation
i from that direction, but In the meantime local
holders had apparently lost confidence and the
offerings at all times exceeded the demand.
The enormous Western movement became the
, one factor as the session advancd. The Mani
toba Government report gave an Increased
wheat acreage with an almost perfect con
i dition. Domestic ' crop news was unfavorable
- as regards winter wheat, but favorable as to
Fprlng wheat. . The market became very weak
toward the close on the announcement of the
! estimated receipts of 400 cars. July finally
i sold down to 7o'/ic and closed at 75'4@75%c.
â¢ Corn early was steady with wheat. Fears
that the strike in Buffalo would again mi
i volve the elevators weakened the market later
and prices gradually slid off.
Oats were independently strong. There was
I again a good demand, mainly for the deferred
I futures, some of the foreign account, and the
most bullish crop report restored prices dur
. ing the decline of ether grains. Selling was
scattered. Receipts were 167 cars. July closed
! Vie higher.
Provisions were steady considering the large
run of hogs and lower yard prices. There
was moderate general buying demand and sell
; Ing was scattered. Trade on the whole was
I small and prices kept within a narrow range
t At the close July pork was unchanged, lard
2 1 , c higher and ribs 2' 4 c higher.

Jim O'Brien Assigned

NEW TRIAL IS DENIED HIM
JOSIE KERR DEPOSES ABOUT
FIXING JURORS.
End of Sensational Case in Which a
Witness Was Kidnaped and the
Grand Jury Investigated
Bribery Charges.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
SOS Broadway, June 12.
James F. O'Bricn, col i. ted of crimi
nally assaulting Miss Nina Ogilvie de B.
T.opez of Pleasanton in November, 1897,
was this afternoon sentenced by Judge
Ellsworth to seven years' imprisonment
in San Queniin. BMB
The case was one of the most sensa
tional of Its kind ever tried in Alameda.
County. The crime was most heinous and
three times was O'Brien tried. On the
lirst occasion he was convicted and Ben
tenced to ten years, but the verdict was
set aside on some technicality. On the
second trial the jury disagreed and
prompted an investigation of bribery
charges by the Grand Jury. The third
trial ended a week ago with a verdict of
COII V* tlon.
The case moreover had been replete
with surprises, on one occasion Josie
KÂ«-rr. a witness for the prosecution, being
kidnaped.
When the matter came up for sentence
to-day ex-Senator Frank McGowan on be
hnlf of the convicted man moved for a
now trial on the ground thai the verdict
was contrary to law and unsupported by
evidence; that th( re had been errors of
law. and that the attorneys for the people
had been guilty of legal misconduct preju
dicial to defendant's rights. Accompany
ing the motion were filed several sensa
tional affidavits. In one of these Witness
Josle Kerr deposed that Detective Her
bert had on June 1.1599, stated to her
'â¢that he was sure O'Brein would be con
victed, or else the jury would not agree;
but they would not acquit because part
of the jury were fixed." Also that he
thought a few of the furors might hold
'AV,V but he was sure they would find
0 Brien guilty, because they were afraid
of being called up by the Grand Jury "
1 lie â "IT woman further deposes that
Attorney Chapman of counsel for prose
cution had said "if there should be a dis
agreement by the jury there would be a
now trial and they would keep trying him
until they got a jury to convict him,
meaning O'Brien."
affidavit was from Richard Ma
ises and says that Josle

A novel way of opening a package of

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, JUNE 13. 1899.
POND OF YOLD
MAY BE LABOR
COMMISSIONER
Gage Has No Use for
Trades Unions.
HE PREFERS A POLITICIAN
OAKLAND'S CANDIDATE HAD A
HALF PROMISE.
A Man Who Always Delivered the
Goods Said to Be Pre
ferred Before a Work-
ingman.
Oakland Office Ran Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, June 12.
A quiet tip has been given out that the
next Labor Commissioner will be Wallace
Pond of Berkeley, who has for many
years been a Republican leader In Yolo
County.
Governor Oage is said to have arrived
at the conclusion that he cannot, without
fomenting strife, appoint a new Commis
sioner from the rank of the trades unions.
Some time ago the Governor invited the
trades unions of the State to submit to
him the names of five men who would
be acceptable to them, implying thereby
that from theso five he would select one.
Many names were submitted to him. ac
companied hy petitions and indorsements,
and in many instances the Governor says
he has received counter petitions, till the
matter became so mixed that he could '
not see his way clear to do anything with :
the Indorsements of the unions which â 
regulate labor.
With this alleged excuse as a pretext,
the Governor, it is said, has decided to
name some <~>ne for the place who has
been Interested in politics. Wallace Pond
for many years was a Republican leader
in Yolo County and could always be de
pended upon to keep up his end in every
campaign. Less than a year ago he
moved to Berkeley, whore he now con
ducts a drug store, but he has had all
his friends working for him, and some of
them have enough assurance to justify
them In naming him as a winner.
This decision of the Governor Is a
great disappointment to Oakland, which
city has been passed by by Governor
Gage with remarkable regularity, with
the exception of the alleged gold brick
now in the possession ot Charles Spear.
This city has been interested in putting
forward the claims of A. J. Read, presi
dent of the State Typographical Union
and trustee of the Church of the Advent.
a brother trustee being James J. Valen
tine. Mr. Read has been indorsed by
many trades unions and has received
some encouragement from those who are
pretty close to the Governor, btit it now
appears thru the semi-promises partook
ot the nature of Charley Spear's appoint
ment.
EXPECT A LIVELY SESSION
Teachers Dread the Coining lu.eeting
of Alameda's School Board.
AI.AMF.nA. June 12. -The Board of Ed
ucation will meet to-morrow night t
teachers and a most exciting session is
looked for. Whether or not changes will
be made is a query that no one can an
swer. The breaking of all combinations
through the difference of opinion origi
nating from the payment of the Hallentine
bill has left the directors at sea. and It is
probable that not until the vote is taken
to-morrow night will the members of the
board themselves know what the results
are to be.
The directors undertook to hold a se
cret caucus and one of those present
failed to keep the secret. This so Incensed
tin other membt-rs that they declare they
will never participate in another star
chamber session. In consequence the
merits of teachers will have to be dis
cussed in open meeting and to-morrow
night some of the AJameda pedagogues
wifl probably be given an opportunity to
h<"ar themselves "picked to pieces."
Teachers who have been threatened with
removal have been at work for a week
pulling wires to save their places.

A GLORIOUS FOURTH.
California Soldiers May Return in
Time to Participate.
The executive committee of the Fourth
of July committee met last evening at the
Grand Hotel. Two prizes for the most
handsomely decorated places of business
in this city were offered; the first will be

reported by the finance committee and
accepted: Appropriation for parade, $37">;
music. $1140: regatta. $600: printing, $100;
invitations, $. r >o; press, $300.
Some discussion arose as to whether the
committee should appropriate money for
thf purpose of decorating streets. The
matter was finally referred back to the
finance committee. The sum of $1500 will
bo expended for fireworks. There will he
several displays, and the committee will
meet representative citizens to-morrow
afternoon to discuss the best locations
for displays. A short time ago a request
that the California Volunteers be per
mitted tn leave Manila on such a date as
to arriv- In San Francisco on or before
July 4 was telegraphed to Washington.
Yesterday the following answer was re
ceived:
H.->n. Julius Knhn, San Francisco: Your wish
that the California volunteers return so as to
reach San Franr-lsro by July 4 has been re
relvr-rl and the substance has been cabled to
General Otta Ht Manila.

It has been proposed to postpone the
Fourth of July celebration should the
boys be scheduled to arrive within a few
days after the Fourth.

that the architectural class of the Hum

It was stated that the citizens" Fourth

the sum of $120 to the regatta committee
for the purpose of giving races on Inde
pendence day. Tho members of the re
gatta committee were strongly of the
opinion that tho sum offered is entirely
inadequate for the purpose, as a good re
gatta costs from $400 to $600. It was
unanimously decided to reject the offer
as a paltry one. The clubs are under the
necessity of spending money for training
and equipment and for necessary repairs
to boats, and the small sum offered would
hardly cover these expenses 5 , without
reckoning the amount that must be ex

HUNTERS START FOR
A NEW SEAL ROOKERY
NEXT ATTACK WILL BE MADE
AT POINT ARENA.
A Government Officer Explains Why
He Protested Against the Thin
ning of the Big Herds.
For all that the Federal authorities at
Washington prohibited the killinp of sea
Hi na on the <"Jovernment reservations on
this coast the State Board of Fish Cnm
rrij-sioners is determined tn keep on with
this work In the interests of the fish In
dustries of the State. While it would have
been more convenient to have carried on
the work of thinning the seal herds off
the entrance of the bay and along the
line of the southern run of salmon, still
there are other places where sea lions
abound In goodly numbers. One of these
places is the bIR rookery a little south of
Point Arena, and to this place Deputy Al
Wilson and W. H. Greene, the experienced
seal hunter, went yesterday. They are
equipped for a lonpr stay and for the de
struction of many of the objectionable sea
animals.
The Point Arena rookery is situated
upon a small island, or large rock, cover
lug several acres, and in past years the
seal herds have made it a breeding
ground. Years ago there was a sealing
station there and large numbers were
taken. The rookery was more frequented
by the brown harking seal than any other,
and thoso are the fellows that the Com
missioners are after, as they have proved
tn be the more destructive of salmon and
fishermen's nets.
The Commissioners have received a lonp
letter from T. S. Palmer, Acting chief Âf
the Biological Survey at Washington,
upon the subject of the protest sent by his
department to the Secre,tary of the Navy
and Lighthouse Board to the killing of i
sea lions on the Government reservations
near this port. Incidentally he stated that
he believed that the estimate of 20, aea
liens within a distance of fifty miles of
this port and that they destroy fr.im 20
to 40 per cent of the salmon entering the !
bay Is rather high, and he says: "It is i
only fair to state that at the 'time our
protest wax made we had no official state
ment of the intention of your board or the j
method of carrying out the work other i
than has appeared : n the press reports." 1
Judging from the tone of Mr. Palmer's i
litter he seems to think that the most of
the damage done to the salmon industry
Is caused by the "harbor" seal and not by
the sea lion, and adds:
"In conclusion permit me to say that
our protest was not inspired from mo
tives of sentiment or from any desire to
oppose the action of your board, but it
seems that if a thorough Investigation of
the food habits of the sea lions had not
been made this was the time to make it,
before undertaking a wholesale slaughter
of the animals."
A BOLD HOLD-UP.
The Tall Man and the Short Man
Again at Work.
T. B. I.eet, employed at thp Telephone
Oyster House at California and Pnlk

Sacramento and Octavla streets by two
footpads. He had 80 cents In his vest
pocket, but it was not found by the rob
bers. I^eet describee the men as "One
tall and one short." A revolver was in
the possession of one of them, and when
they failed to find anything on his per

WHO SILL
PAY ALL THE
COSTS OF SUIT?
Aftermath of the Grain
Rate Case.
BEFORE THE CIRCUIT COURT
A LEGAL QUESTION ON THE DIS
MISSAL OF THE SUIT.
The Railroad Contends That in Re
scinding the Original Resolu
tion the Commission For
feited All Claim.
The question of costs for the grain rate
case tried In the Circuit Court came up
before Judge Morrow yesterday. The case
Itself has been dismissed, but it left a
legacy of litigation in the question of costs
and who should pay them. The last ac
tion in the matter was taken by the State
In a motion to so modify the decree of
dismissal that the State should have its
costs paid by the railroad, and it was this
motion which was under argument yes
terday.
E. S. Pillsbury represented the railroad
and Attorney General Ford and Judge
Hayne appeared for the State, despite t^e
fact that at the last meeting of the Kail
road Commission it was deride. l to dis
pense with special counsel. Mr. Ford
spoke first.
In his argument he contended that tho
railroad had voluntarily dismissed the
suit and therefore by rule of court it was
responsible for the costs. In courts of
equity, he said, a dismissal of the bill of
complaint is taken to be a judgment in
favor of the defendant, and unless there
are extraordinary reasons why the court
should exercise its discretion in favor of
the complainant the defendants are of
right entitled to their costs.
No such reason existed in the cape at
bar, Mr. Ford contended. The railroad
had never rescinded the 8 per cent re
duction: it had rescinded the pre
liminary resolution but it had never re
scinded the schedule itself; in other
words, when the commission rescinded
the resolution it left the schedule of rat.es
still In force and that schedule had never
been dismissed. The railroad, he claimed,
had voluntarily dismissed the action,
abandoned the field and had left the Com
missioners masters of the situation with
the rate complained of still in full force.
That being true, he argued, the rail
road company had in fact admitted that
Its bill was without foundation and its
motion for a dismissal was in fact a
withdrawal from the contest. That being
the case, he reasoned, the company
should ray to the Railroad Commis.sion*
ers the costs they had incurred in the ac
tion.
In answer Mr. Pillsbury reviewed the
history of the case from the time of the
original resolution to the motion of the
State for costs. In September of 1595, he
said the commission passed a resolution
making a horizontal reduction of 25 per
cent on all rates other than grain rates
and a reduction of S per cent on grain
rates. In the succeeding month the rail
road brought suit for an Injunction re
straining the commission from enforcing
the schedule so established. Tn Novem
ber of the next year the injunction was
granted, and Mr. Pillsbury read from the
decision of Judge McKenna in support of
some of the statements ne made about
the case presented by the State. He had
said that the commission admitted the
reduction of 25 per cent could not be en
forced, and the Commissioners would not
try to enforce it. On that point Judge

McKenna wrote he thought the language
of the resolution was plain, and it hal
presumbably been prepared after due in
quiry Into the matter; hut in view of the
statements of the counsel for the com
mission that the schedule would never be
enforced he would dissolve the injunction
as to the 25 per cent reduction and would
further continue the injunction against
the grain rate reduction until the further
order of thf court.
The case ran along then until April of
1898, when the pleadings were settled and
the taking of testimony propeeded. There
had been 3000 pages taken when the new
board went into office in the beginning
of this year. On April 24 last the new
board rescinded both resolutions and di
rected the Attorney General to move to
dismiss the suits without either party
paying the costs of the ither. Some days
after the Attorney General made the mo
tion asking that the cases be dismissed
and that each party be allowed to pay
its own costs. The motion was heard
May S ami was denied on the ruling of
Judge Morrow that the defendant had no
right to move for a dismissal.
In pursuance of this state of affairs, Mr.
Pillsbury contended, the railroad on May
19 last moved to dismiss the case, append
ing to the motion a copy of the resolu
tion of the Railroad Commission rescind
ing the resolutions reducing the rates and
directing the Attorney General to dismiss
the suit, while each party paid ttfl own
costs. The motion or the company was
granted and the order dismissing the ease
was entered, but there was nothing in it
about costs: and a few days later the
State asked to be allowed its costs.
That brought the case up to the session
yesterday, and Mr. Pillsbury proceeded to
draw his conclusions from it.
He argued that in winning on the orig
inal Injunction proceedings the company
was entitled to its costs for that much
of the suit. When the answer of the
State had been put in the company had
made certain objections to it and they
had all been sustained, the company
therefniv stiil being entitled to its costs
It was stated at the time that there was
no money in the appropriaion for the
c;ise to pay costs, and Mr. Pillsbury said
[ the company paid them temporarily"pend
ing the outcome of the case. Then the
taking of testimony began, and after it
hail proceeded as far as three thousand
pages the State moved to dismiss, each
party to pay Its own costs.
In making this motion. Mr. Pillsbury
contended, the State waived all right to
have its costs paid by the railroad. The
company had won on the original injunc
tion, he said; it had won on the objec
tions to the answer, and then, by rescind
ing the resolution upon- which the whole
case had been based, it left the company
with nothing -to sue for and the court
nothing to try. The original resolution
! having caused all the trouble and expense
1 and that having been rescinded. Mr. Pllls
i bury claimed the commissioners were re-
I sponsible for the costs of the suit the
original resolution had caused. By re
scinding the resolution they admitted it
was not right and just, and that was all
the company was fighting for. It was,
in fact, a victory for the company, and
he claimed that while the railroad was
willing to pay its own costs, it should not
be assessed for the costs of the State.
The case will go on again to-morrow
when Mr. Pillsbury will finish his argu
ment.
KILLED BY A FALL.
C. Dunn, a Painter, Meets Death
While at Work in San Mateo
County.
C. Dunn, a painter who resided at 916
Howard street, fell from the roof of a
shed at Captain Cole's residence in San
Mateo County yesterday afternoon and
was picked up unconscious. He was taken
to St. Mary's Hospital, where he died
without regaining consciousness.
Dunn, who was employed by J. H. Keefe
of 317 Sutter street, went down into San
Mateo County yesterday morning in com
pany with James Casey to paint Captain
Cole's residence at that place. During- the
afternoon he climbed up by means of a
rope to fasten some cleats. The rope
parted and precipitated him to the roof
cf a shed. He struggled for a moment to
gain a hold on the edge of the roof, but
slipped and fell to the ground, a distance
of about twenty feet. His skull, knee
and right arm were fractured by the fall
and ho also sustained internal injuries.
Dunn was 44 years of age and unmar
ried. He was a brother of former School
Director J. J. Dunn.

But will San Francisco s^" now?
Judging from the comments of the
seemingly disappointed audience that
filed out of the playhouse last night at
the close of the abbreviated performance
with its elongated costumes, it would be
safe to answer that question in the nega
tive.
Yesterday was a day of expectancy, of
injunctions, of dissertations an morality
art, and what not in local dramatic
circles. The public awoke to find that
a real, unexpurgated, tip-to-date French
piny that New York lias relished for two
years steadily had been transplanted di
their ml<Jst, and instantly the public
prepared to descend in a body upon the
box office. Later there were circulated
rumors that the play was to be sup
pressed and a shade of disappointment
overspread the male public's features
even as the public iroiced approval of this
step in the direction of decency.
Not until afternoon was anything
done, but then a petition was filed in
Judge Paingerfleld's court by Acnes M
Agar. JoaeMi M. Macdonough and Wil
liam 08. Itacdon Â»ugh, by their attor

she goes back to the husband she de

Upon hearing the petition, the Judge im

and the case was assigned t" Judge Heb

served upon Manager Prledlander at 4:;:"

At 7 o'clock the theater was in dark

the Macdonoughs' agent, came in and tho
two held a long consultation.
At 7:30 the doors were still closed and
the theater was dark. Holders of tickets

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, JUNE 13, 1899.
V.. J. Mr.rsrnn. who plays Edward Falk
ner, the lovÂ« r. Mr. Morgan we knew for
an actor of immense promise when he
played hie at the Baldwin a couple of
Beacons back. Now he has made that
promise good and must be reckoned
among the bit? ones. He had the part
last night, a part that in the usual first
iat,. company might readily be made
subsidiary to that of Sir Christopher
Deering, played now by Mr. Miller.
Hut with Morgan as Falkner, I don't
think the actor acts who can make this
young man play Becond fiddle.
It is no reproach to Mr. Millar to say
that the lion's honors fall to his young
colleague in this play; indeed. it is
rather a graceful triumph of another
sort for Mr. Miller that they do, and a
generous tribute to his actor manage
ment. : : i:
Morgan's performance is an occasion
for adjectives, lie has the presence, a
fine natural presence; the voice, rich
.nnl companionable and now under
surer control than in the other days;
the Intensity and repression and mag
!;â  tlsm and authority of his art; and the
almost divine quality of being always
human on the stage. He has fewer
tricks ami greater effect than any other
act, ,r that 1 have seen in seasons. His
personation in this piece is simply
sensational in its straightforwardness
and In its spell.
As the "Squire of dames" of the
piece. Mr. Miller played in a surprising
ly light and graceful vein. He was es
pecially good in the scenes with Mor
gan where a certain amount of strenu
: mis sentiment was called for.
The leading woman. Miss Margaret
Anglin. Bhowed great delicacy and
keenness in the part of the wayward
wife. She has few porsonnl blandish

the tact that win. Others in the cast

they were not comfortable and they
heartily wished they had followed their
sisters' example and bought tickets ear
lier.
At a quarter to 8, when the ticket
. holders were showing unmistakable signs
: of Impatience, Manager Friedlander canw
downstairs from his private office and gave
, a sign to his assistants who were in wait
i ing. Instantly the doors were opened, the
lights turned on and one of the largest
crowds th*.- theater ever contained began
:to nle In. Every seat was sold down
stairs and upstairs and it was not Ions?
before they were all occupied. Then came.
i another wait. The orchestra did not tile
In and the people wondered what was
going to happen next. Everybody knew
about the Injunction, and everybody Im
agined that the management was trying
to run some sort of a "bluff" on tho
; court.
T'.ut it wasn't; it had merely secured a
dissolution of the injunction on the under
standing that all the objectionable fea
tures of the play would be eliminated, it
was only after many conferences that this
concession was secured, and. not until 7:30
did Judge Hebbard dissolve the injunction
(out of chambers) on that agreement. Mr.
Priedlander's attorneys, however, finally
obtained the order nnd hurried to tho
th. ater. Then it was that the doors were
opened.
It required some little time tj carve
"The Turtle" so that it could be served to
the satisfaction of the court and San
Francisco theater-goers. It was finally
accomplished, however, and at S:3O the
overture struck up. The audience not
knowincr of the agreement, awaited ex
pectantly, though fearful that a squad of
Deputy Sheriffs would break up the per
formance at any moment. But nothing of
the kind occurred. The management kept
its agreement to the letter, and when the
curtain fell the audience departed feeling
that it had bought a gold brick.
For "The Turtle" as dished up to them
was tlat and insipid to what they had ex
pected.
between Tactanu; the female imperson
ator, and Fred Niblo, the monolngist.
That Ticianu Is an artist in his line there
can be no question. He Pings both so
prano and barytone, excelling possibly as
a soprano. Fred Niblo comes with a
string of stories both new and old (mostly
im w), but in either case he tells them well.
The Wartenberg brothers have a novel
act combining acrobatic feats and music.
The bi at of their work, however, is their
foot juggling. Hanley and Jarvis go fair
ly well, but mig-ht have more modern
jokes. Houdini continues to be the sensa
â¢ Uonal feature. Others on the bill are
Johnstone Bennett, Henri French and
McAvoy and May.
Alcazar.
Lewis Morrison, assisted by Miss Flor
ence Roberts and the Alcazar Stock Com
pany, presented at the Alcazar last night
"The Master of Ceremonies," which had
such a successful run on Its first produc
tion last summer. The cast was the same
with two or three exceptions and nothing
was lost by the change. The two princi
pals met with a flattering reception and
wero several times called before the cur
tain after the close of the second and
third acts. The support was excellent.
Olympia.
Querlta Vincent scored a hit at the
Olympfa last night. Arrayed In the most
dazzling costumes ever seen on the Olym
pia stage, this talented California girl de
livered her "coon" songs and buck and
wing dances in a way that won many
encores. Herbert and Weston came in for
a goodly share of the audience's enthusi
asm, and the same fortune favored the
La Rose brothers.
The Chutes.
Stanley and Scanlon, musical cemedians,
extracted all sorts of music from all sorts
of Instruments at the Chutes Theater last
evening, the "flying" Banvards tossed
each other from one side of the building
to the other, and Mr. and Mrs. Keesing
changed their songs. The rest of the bill
was good.
Alhambra.
The Lambardi ccm--any repeated Its ex
cellent performance of "Lucia" in the
Alhambra last nipht to an enthusiastic
audience. "Ernani" will be given to-night
with Avedano. Barducci, Ferrari and
Travogllni In the cast.
Grand Opera-House.
"El Capitan" was revived with signal
success by the Southwell company at
the Grand. The recentness of the former
production makes an extended review un
necessary. Enough to say that the same
strong production was given.

PHELAN TRAPPED BY
THE GAS COMPANIES
Mayor and the Minority Accept a
Bogus Compromise.
The Corporations Fix Their Own Rates and the City
Abandons Its Right to a Hearing in Court.
Street Franchises Discussed.
Gas and electric light rates to the
muncipalily and to private consumers
â¢have been reduced by the Board of Su
pervisors. Mayor Phelan Is smiling In
the innocent belief that he has won a
victory, very materially political, and
the pas and electric light corporations
are delighted in the fact that they have
humbugged the Mayor, imposed upon
his faithful minority and cheated the
city out of what might have been a
preat public benefit. After a deal of
noise, the blare of political trumpets
and much official fuss and feathers the
Mayor and the minority have accepted
the terms of the corporations, jeopar
dized, if not destroyed, their own action
'â¢in fixing a rale of ?1 10 a thousand feet
and restored to the majority members
of the Board of Supervisors the unques
tioned right to meet as often as they
please and take whatever action they
â wish under the limitations of the con
solidation act.
, By the authority and with the sanc
tion of Mayor Phelan the Board of Su
pervisors met yesterday afternoon and
adopted the very rate for gas which the
3ocaJ corporations were eager to accept
on March L. The Mayor and the minor
ity members of the board have united
with the majority In a betrayal of the
city in its effort to secure a material
reduction In the rates for gas and elec
tric lighting. The Mayor and his fol
lowers in the board have stultified
themselves and have made a complete
sacrifice of any legal right to maintain
the rate of ?1 10 for gas. They have offi
cially adopted an agreement that all
existing controversies between the city
end county and the San Francisco Gas
and Electric Company and Pacific Gas
Improvement Company are formally
(tied.
This means nothing more or less than
an filcial withdrawal of the ?1 10 rate
and an acceptance of a rate of fl 50.
In settling the controversy the Board
of Supervisors adopted a new rate, thus
abandoning the claim that the board
has the right to fix a rate for a year,
and, having fixed a rate, cannot make
another. The very agreement by which
the bnard, under the guidance of the
Mayor, bowed to the gas and electric
light companies was written by an at
torney of the corporation and was
framed to accomplish just what his em
ployers wanted. And the Mayor still
thinks he won a victory.
The vital part of the agreement is
the settlement of the controversy in
which the gas and electric companies
saw that they inevitably must lose. It
is then provided in the resolution which
was adopted yesterday that from July
I gas rates for private consumers shall
"be $1 50 a thousand feet instead of $1 75.
Bates for the city shall be $1 35 a thou
sand feel instead of $1 50 and 10 "cents
a. night for each street lamp instead of
II cents. On electric light bills there
ehall be a reduction of 15 per cent. On
paper and in the confiding brain of the
Mayor this means a saving of $300,000
a year for the people of the city and
â¢approximately $40,000 to the municipal
government. As a matter of fact the
only saving Is to the local government.
Â«nd half of the amount is in accrued
bills.
The Mayor, in permitting himself to
be deceived into a bogus compromise
'by the crafty representatives of the
gas and electric light companies, has
simply delayed the people of the city
,from enjoying whatever dubious bene
fits the corporations were willing to
â prant four months ago. In February
Supervisor Aigeltinger offered a resolu
tion to take effect on March 1 and to
provide for a rate of $1 GO for gas. The
Mayor opposed the measure, and now,
lafter a great deal of noise and threaten
ing nonsense he accepts .it.
There was an air of great expectancy
around the Mayor's office yesterday
morning and afternoon. The minority
members were rushing in and out in
flurried activity. Representatives of
the gas and electric light companies
avere in conference with Mayor Phelan,
and all sorts of bogus compromises
â were suggested and discussed. Mayor
Phelan prepared a statement to the
majority members of the board pro
testing against their meeting without
"his sanction and declaring their former
meeting illegal. This the Mayor intend
ed to issue If the compromise with the
gas companies were not effected. The
subsequent developments of- the day
made it unnecessary to issue the doc
ument.
The representatives of the corpora
tions had their plan of action clearly
outlined before they went to the office
of the Mayor. They craftily asked
more than they wanted, and more than
they knew they could get, in order' to
make apparent concessions and secure
just what they wanted. Attorney
Pillsbury made two propositions, and
finally accepted -he alleged compro
mise as it was subsequently adopted by
the board.
While the discussion was taking place
In the Mayor's office the majority mem
bers of the Board of Supervisors were
in session In their assembly chamber.
They had Ignored the Mayor and were
transacting the ordinary business of the
board. Before any matters of import
ance had been considered the confer
ence in the Mayor's office ended with
the compromise, and the Mayor and
the five members of the board proceed
ed to the assembly chamber. The
Mayor had presented to every member
of the board an official call and then
took the presiding officers cna;r.
When the call was read Supervisor
Holland declared that the board was in
regular session, and he saw no reason
for such a document. He, therefore,
offered an objection to its presentation.
Mayor Phelan replied that he had is
sued the call simply to give legality to
the meeting of the board. "You may
have one opinion in reference to this
matter," he said, "and I may have an
other. I have done this simply to avoid
confusion and I ask Supervisor Holland
to withdraw his objection."
"I cannot do so," replied Holland, "as
I believe a call Is unnecessary.''
The Mayor asked the opinion of the
other members and Supervisor Aigel
tlnger declared that while he had no i
objection to the presence of the Mayor
he insisted that the meeting was regu
lar and no call was needed. Mayor
Phelan then decided that the call
should be spread upon the minutes and
thus become officially a part of the
meeting.
"Are we to consider then," asked Su
pervisor Aigeltinger, "that by permit
ting this proceeding we admit that
what we have already done is illegal?"
">int at all," was the Mayor's reply.
"I accept what you have done up to
this point and will not question it."
After the transaction of considerable
routine business Supervisor Perrault j
moved that the rules be suspended and j
the board listen. to a statement which j
the representative of the gas and elec- j
trie light companies wished to make, i
Attorney Bishop was then given an op
portunity to speak. He related how the |
Mayor and the minority had met in I
conference and had finally agreed upon
a compromise in reference to electric
and gas light rates. The compromise ;
was described in detail and when the j
attorney had finished Supervisor Deasy |
moved that it be accepted and adopted
by the board.
This gave Mayor Phelan the oppor
tunity to commit perhaps the most bril- i
liant mistake of his administration.
He suggested that it would be far bet
ter to have the terms of the compro- I
mise placed in the form of a written |
resolution. This was done by the at
torney for the gas and electric light
companies and was presented in the
following gem of crafty manipulation:
Resolved, That all existing contro
versies between the City, and County
of San Francisco and the San Fran-
Cisco Gas and Electric Company and
Pacific Gas Improvement Company
be and the same are hereby settled
upon the following basis of compro
mise, as agreed to by the said light
ing companies with his Honor the
Mayor, and this Board, to wit:
1. Bate for gas to consumers shall
be fixed at the rate of $1 50 per onÂ©
tnousand cubic feet of gas; this rate
to take effect July 1, 1899.
2. Bills accrued and to accrue for '
gas furnished public buildings shall
be paid for at the rate of $1 35 per j
one thousand cubic feet.
3. Bills accrued and to accrue for !
gas furnished for street lighting
shall be paid for at the rate of 10 !
cents per lamp per night, instead of
1 1 cents per light per night.
4. All electric lighting bills^ccrued
and. to accrue, whether for street I
lighting or public buildings, shall be I
paid with a reduction of 15 per cent
off the face of the bills rendered at
the contract price.
5. If new contracts are let for light- !
ing public buildings with gas, the ;
said lighting companies agree to bid ;
for the same at the rate of not to ex
ceed $1 35 per one thousand cubic
feet.
The foregoing resolution was adopted
by the board by a unanimous vote.
The gas and electric light corporations
had won their victory. They may now
go before Superior Judge Sea.well and
show that the city has rescinded its I
action in fixing a rate of $1 10 a thou
sand feet and has adopted a new rate,
at the same time and by its own action
abandoning its claim to a right to fix
gas rates once a year.
Upon motion of Supervisor Aigeltin
ger the following resolution fixing a
maximum rate and establishing stand
ards was also adopted:
Resolved, That the minimum stand
ard quality and illuminating power of
gas to be furnished by any person, com.
pany or. corporation to be used in the
city and county of San Francisco is
hereby fixed and established at seven
teen candles, and the maximum rate to
be charged and collected therefor from
consumers by any such person, com
pany or corporation is hereby fixed and
established at $1 50 per one thousand
cubic feet.
Secondâ All ordinances and resolu- I
tions and parts of ordinances and reso
lutions in conflict herewith are hereby
repealed.
Thirdâ resolution shall be in
force and take effect on the first day
of July, 1899.
The very Important question of gas
rates had been determined and the city
had lost through the inability of the
Mayor and the minority to see the plot
which had been hatched for them. Af
ter the meeting Mayor Pbelan gave an
outline of his position in the matter i
and claimed that the question of the I
$1 10 rate is properly before the courts.
The Mayor did not realize when he
made that remark that by the agree
ment, craftily framed by corporation
agents and accepted by the city, the ;
$1 10 rate had been officially aban
doned. His Honor is probably wiser to
day.
In his discussion of the events of the
session of the board, the Mayor also
described the Incidents of the various
conferences, and saw a victory In the
fact that the gas and electric light com
panies had at last, after bitter and I
continued contention, admitted the
right of the city to fix rates for gas
and electric lighting.
During the meeting of the Board of
Supervisors the problem of Btreet fran
chises was also . considered, but ; noth
ing of importance was done. By In
THE SAIST FKANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, JTXKE 13, 1899.
MAD STEED RUNS AMUCK
ON A CROWDED STREET
HEROIC ACTION OF JAMES GALLAGHER
EDESTRIANS on Market street
P^V were treated to a thrilling sight
I M yesterday afternoon. A power
\^T ful black mustang dashed up
j the thoroughfare, endangering
I the lives of passengers on the
" cable cars and sightseers In its
flight. But for the heroic action of
James Gallagher, a teamster employed
by Curtaz & Sons, who at the risk of
his life brought the animal to a stop,
pedestrians might have been killed and
great damage done to the show win
dows of the stores In that neighbor
hood.
About 3 o'clock William Beckmann,
who keeps a grocery store at the cor
ner of Sixth and Bryant streets, was
driving his spirited animal on Market
street. In the vehicle was a number
of boxes of potatoes. When close to
Grant avenue the horse took fright
and reared, snapping the shaft from
its fastenings. This caused the ani
mal to become further alarmed, and
with the bit in his teeth he shot up
Market street. The start was so sud-
vitation President Dohrmann of the
Merchants' Association addressed the
board in advocacy of the proposed
corkscrew and Post street franchise.
Representatives of the North Ontral
Improvement Club and of the Sixth
Streel Improvement Club also spoke,
and the board referred all franchises
back to the Street Committee for fur
ther consideration. The flouble track
franchise asked by the Southern Pa
cific Company will not be granted, as
its consideration was indefinitely post
poned. The city, therefore, won one
victory and suffered a most disastrous
defeat.
CAUSED THE DEATH OF
TIMOTHY GUY PHELPS
The Two Bicyclists Who Ran Him Down at San Carlos
Surrender Themselves to the Police.
SHERIFF MANSFIELD of San
Mateo County came to the city
yesterday morning to search for
the two bicyclists who ran down
and causer! the death of Timo-
thy Guy Phelps at San Carlos on
Decoration day. He gave a descrip
tion of the two young men to Chief
Lees and the Chief prepared circulars
to be Bent throughout the State.
He was saved further trouble, as
the two yourg men, accompanied by
another bicyclist, Who was with them
at the time, called at the City Hall
and surrendered themselves to Detec
tives Ryan and O'Dea. They are
Frank Sampson, a typefounder living
at 14V& Bernard Htreet, and Thnmas
Jones, a butcher living at 1619 Folsom
street. ThÂ« one who accompanied
them wan Fred Kennott, an Instru
ment-maker living at 38 Silver Btreet.
The three were detained in prison
pending their removal to Ban Mateo
by thÂ« Sheriff. They Bold that they
den that Beckmann was thrown off his
seat to the ground, hut valiantly held
on to the reins in an effort to stop the
animal. He was dragged about ten
feel and bad to release his hold on the
lines and the wagon passed completely
over him without touching him.
Women stood transfix". l on the pave
ment at the terrible predicament nf
the driver. Men raised their voices in
warning to those in the pathway of
the maddened steed. There was a
scurry to points of safety. Drivers
whipped th< ii horses and managed to
clear the street i;i time to avoid the
rush. That no one was killed by the
runaway is nothing short of a mira
cle. Shortly before the incident the
cable cars were stopped by the break
ing of the rope and were lined up short
distances apart, crowded with human
freight, who. although warned of the
approach of the team, were unable r<>
seek safety.
Fn its Might the runaway nearly
swept a young bicyclist into another
world. A shout at the proper time
warned the young rider and he sneered
cl iS4 to the curb. Opposite Fourth
street the swerving vehicle struck a
buggy, sending its horse to its knees
SHE LOST AND ALSO WON.
Judge Seawell Decides the Case of
Fannie Rosenthal Against
M. N. Hirseh.
The suit of Fannie Rosenthal, brought
through her assignee, J. .1. Raver, against
M. N. Hlrsch, her late partner in the to
bacco business, has come to a close. Mr?.
Rosenthal alleged that Hirseh borrowed
diamonds fr<->m her valued at several
hundred dollars "with which to make a
flash." and was also indebted to her to
th>> extent nf several hundred dollars for
board. Yesterday Judge Seawell found
that Mrs. Rnsenthal made Hirseh a pres
ent of the jewels for favors he had done
her and on that claim entered a judgment
were unaware of the identity of the
man they ran over or that he had re
ceived serious injury till they paw an
account of it and Mr. Phelps" picture
in Sunday's papers. They then talked
it over and decided to surrender them
selves.
Their stnry of the accident is as fol
lows: They left the city about 5:30
o'clock on the morning of Decoration
day to ride to Glenwoorl Park. Samp
son and Jones rode tandem and Ken
nett a wheel. When they reached San
Carlos they saw an old gentleman in
front of them carrying a apade over
hie shoulder, a hamnvr and a tin con
taining nails In his hand. Before they
overtook him a milk wagon coming to
ward them had about reached him and
he walked Herons, as if to hail the
driver of the wagon. Kennett was
about fifteen feet ahead of Sampson
and Jones, and as ho passed the old
gentleman he shouted to him to look
out, but he did not seem to take any
and staying for the moment the flight
of the runaway. The impact caused
Beckmann's horse to turn toward the
sidewalk, overturning the wagon and
spilling its contents on the street.
Some of the boxes struck the crazy
animal and drove him to renewed ef
forts to escape. With his broken har
ness and whiffletree hanging about his
hoofs, bleeding from numerous cuts on
the body, the black steed bolted along
the sidewalk in front of the Phelan
building, driving the pedestrians into
the doorways and out on the streets.
It was then that James Gallapher
displayed his bravery. Being of pow
erful build, he waited until the horse
was close to him and with a spring
he clutched the horse's bridle in his
strong hand and with a n,uick wrench
threw the animal on his haunches.
His partner. Robert O'Day, quickly
sprang forward, as did others, and
held the struggling hnrse.
Gallagher's action in stopping the
runaway was a spectacular one and
won for him words nr praise, pats on
the back and other marks of approval.
He modestly bore the good words and
after seeing the animal again in the
custody of its owner left the scene
with G Day.
for the defendant, but on the other hand
the court decided that Hirseh was in
debted to the plaintiff in the sum of $450
and entered judgment In favor nf the
plaintiff and against the defendant for
that amount.
Wr.s Not Murdered
The old man supposed to be A. P. Hen
derson, who died suddenly last Saturday
night at 635 Clay street, died of apoplexy
and was not murdered, as was believed.
An autopsy yesterday by Morgue Surgeon
Zabala established the fact that death
was due to natural causes.

the tandem. The wheel struck him
on the legs and knocked him down.
Sampson and Jones were thrown from
the wheel and the handle bars of the
wheel were wrenched. Kennett re
turned and assisted Sampson and
Jones to raise Mr. Phelps to his feet,
who complained of being jarred about
the head. Before raising him up he
said to them, "Walt a minute; let me
sit. here," and then fell back. They
brushed the dust from his clothes and
he wanted to walk away, but the driv
er of the milk wagon made him climb
into the wagon and drove him home.
They asked the driver who the old
gentleman was and he answered "T.
G. Phelps." but they did not know
who Mr. Phelps was. After fixing up
the machine they rode on to Los Gatos
and hack to the city. They were not
riding faster than eleven miles an
hour, and express regret at the result
of the accident.

Board of Health this forenoon. At places
where the politicians loiter ami discuss
patronage distribution the opinion is gen
erally expressed that Leon Dennery will
be. elected secretary of the board.
Last evening Drs. Barbat, Coffey and
Payne, newly-appointed members, were
asked if it was on the programme to se
lect Dennery for Feoretary.
Dr. Barbat replied: 'The subject will
probably be considered at a conference of
morniru before
the regular meeting. I do not understand
that there is an agreement to elect Den
mry. We have had hut one caucus since
our appointment and no decision has been
reached regarding the secretaryship. "
Dr. R. W. Payne in answer to The Call
inquiry said: "I do not know of any
agreement or understanding to elect Leon
Pennery secretary of the board. I know
that he is a candidate and believe that he
is confident of success."
Dr. W. B. Coffey replied: "I do not know
of any programme to elect Dennery sec
retary of the board. There may be some
agreement or understanding that he shall
b* chosen for the place, but I am not in
formed of it. Three members can elect.
Yes the Mayor has a vote, but 1 do not
know that he will express a choice. Mr.
Dennery is not the only candidate. Ihere
are others."
In view of the incident that law and
moral sentiment have been invoked to
suppress an indecent exhibition at the
California Theater, the members of the
Htalth Board may feel constrained to re
flect seriously before they accept a pro
gramme which contemplates the selection
oi: Dennery for secretary.
The members of the Board of Health
are reputable physicians in good standing.
The question may occur to them, Can -are
justify such an appointment to our fellow
members of the medical fraternity?
Physicians, as a rule, demand a good if
not a high standard of personal character
and intellectual qualification in men as
piring to public service, and they may ex
pect their fellow-members on the Health
Board to. recognize the standard.
Ir appointing Drs. Barbat, Coffey,
Pavne and Keeney to compose the Board
of 'Health the Governor was influenced
mainly by the Southern Pacific Company
and Dan" Burns. Gage believes thut he
was discovered by Burns and elected by
I-lerrin. and thotefoie holds ihat common
gratitude requires him to follow tho
course outlined by the Candelarian and
the corporation.
The appointments to the Board oi
Health are about the best of Gage's ad
ministration. The Call is conscious that
no great compliment to the board is con
veyed in this observation, but the fact
is obvious, however, that worse appoint
ments could have been made, and it is
therefore a bit surprising that the Gov
ernor did not make them.
While Gage is going down the line and
Inviting some rare specimens of un
worthiness to step forward, it is doubtful
if Dan Bruns and Herrin can elicit a
recommendation from him that Leon Den
nerv be appointed secretary of the Board
of Health.
The political strife at the San Jose Nor
mal School is In a fair way to be con
cluded. The directors have practically
agreed on a scheme that they declare will
end existing unpleasantness and further
the best interests of the s'thool.
On the 19th of August the new presi
dent, Dr. McNaughten. who was recently
elected, will present his report to the
board. According to the rules of the
school, the Board of Directors must eclef.c f .
teachers from nominations made by the
president. It is known that in his re
port President MrNaughten will recom
mend that Professor Childs and Professor
Randell each be placed at the head of an
important department in the Normal
School.
This plan will pacify both elements who
are .politically Interested in the school.
Professor Randell is now president, and
was appointed by Governor Budd four
rears ago in place <>f Professor Childs.
Each man has a strong following of
friends, and of course should either one
be placed at the head of the Institution
the other"s friends would be dissatisfied.
It was thought host to bring a new man
to control the institution and to place
both the ex-presidents in important posi
tions, as both are very competent men.
Tn order to do this the heads of two
of the departments will of course be
dropped. One of them will probably be
the head of the history department, but
the other is not yet decided upon. When
President .Rande'll assumed charge four
years ago it was regarded as significant
that his report did not recommend the
appointment of his predecessor, Childs. in
the history department, as was antici
pated, but such a recommendation will
probably be included in President Mc-
Naughten's report. M .
The new president is elected for one
year, and the directors will not make any
important changes among the other
teachers for several months until an op
portunity has been afforded the new
board of testing the value of the material
at present employed.
Expeditious Work.

assault to murder and appeared for his
preliminary examination before Judg^
Treadwell yesterday. After hearing the
evidence the Judge held him to answer

DISCUSSED THE PRESS
IN ITS VARIOUS PHASES
DR. HAMMOND SAYS NEWSPA
PERS ARE A BLESSING.
Rev. John Hammond, D.D., of the
Methodist Church South. Alameda. read
a paper on "The Press 1 ' before the
Methodist Ministers' Union at their week
ly meeting yesterday morning. In part
he said:
Of onursp the press pxatrtcprntes and there is
no remedy hut to convert the reporters and the
Mitors. The Apostles wpn> the first reporters,
but unfortunately reporters are not Apostles.
but neither are all ministers.
iÂ»n the whole, there is perhaps no greater
blessings to our civilization than the. press The
newspaper if? an old institution. God was th*s
first e.iitor-the stars but "extras" posted upon
the great bulletin hoard of the night. What
is the sin but a great newsboy leaving a copy
of heaven's ereat daily at the doorway of
every island, telling us that there is no change
in the policy of the Heaven's administration
but that love still reigns''
The duty nf the press is to let the world
Know Itself; to paint a real, not an ideal world.
Ufesized pictures of the penthouse must b.
hung In sight of Nob Hill. The press is the
artist that must paint them: the press is the
telephone that must carry up th" thundi
the strike to the parlors of the capitalists and
br^ak his siesta with the cry of labor It is
thus wrongs will be righted, but they must be
first known.
During; thf> discussion which followed
the conclusion of I >r. Hammond's paper
Rev. W. B. Anderson, pastor of Bethle
hem A. M. E. church, took occasion to
rebuke the ministers for not having; con
demned the Georgia lynching?. He spoke
of their being solicitous about the suf
fering Armenians and the threo mission
aries who were killed in Africa. "My
people are burdened, heavily oppress. ,] "
ho said, "but by the help of God and the
preps they will yet he able to develop.
It is known that the pr<=ss had much to
do with the abolition of slavery: now it
has taken up the subject of lynch law
and what are we doing:? I am speaking
now in the cause of humanity. 1 think
we need touching; up. I have taken cour
age and am determined to speak out.
Some prpachers can't speak because they
are crooked."
The rebuke was mildly received.
