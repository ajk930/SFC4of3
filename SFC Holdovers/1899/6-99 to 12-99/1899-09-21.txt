HERRIN TO BE SHELVED
AS POLITICAL MANAGER
Story That E. 0. McCormick Is
to Head the Bureau.

It is not asserted that Herrln is to be deprived of his rank and emoluments
as director of the law department. He will be on deck as usual in the yellow
building:, and will be permitted to r*n? on* bi-11 to Fommon PiUsbury and two
bells to bring in McEnerney, as he recently remarked to an angelic companion.
One of Mr. Herrin's chief ?ources of delight is to dwell on the fact that lawyers
of the highest grade promptly respond to his suggestions.
One cannot say that Mr. Herri recounts to men his achievements as a com
mar; of lawyers, but the subject is frequently Introduced to charm the angels
of the fair sex. It Is due to Mi Herrin to -â¢.â  that he does not boast of his
achievements as the manager of the Southern Pacific political bureau, and it Is
due to Cnllis P. Huntlngton to say that the president of the company has not
paid a public tribute to the law department's management of the late Senatorial
campaign. It must be obvious, therefore, that the historian must look to the
re-cords of the law to find proof of Herrings greatness. The proof will not be
found the record of politics or the drama, for Herrin blunders as readily in
dealing with the fair exponent of dramatic art as he does in intriguing with the
debased politician.
If Passenger Agent McCormick enters the political arena in California he
may be sure of going in under what is commonly called the most favorable aus
pices. No matter what he may dt> he â will not do worse than Herrin has done.
In Ohio, Illinois and Indiana Mr. McCormick looked after the Interests of the
"Big Four." In the four big cities which the rails join Mr. McCormick was
familiar with the local politics of the several towns. He knew Mayors and
members of Congress and was on intimate speaking terms with several Gover
nors, but with none just like ours. He came West, like many of his predecess
ors, to enlarge his horizon and his salary, but the change of base has not dimin
ished or dulled his fancy for taking a hand In politics.
.v doubt there is a fine field in California for a railroad man who possesses
the double qualification of a passenger traffic manager and political manipulator.
A passenger man like Mr. McCormick ought to know how to place passes where
they will do the most good. Herrin's first blunder In the late Senatorial cam
paign was committed with the assistance of a pass, but as the campaign pro
gressed he got so that he could commit a blunder without any assistance.
Mr Hi â  "rmick is everywhere - t in the highest terms of commenda
tion. He went E â â¢ iys ago over the Southern Pacific to attend a
meeting of tue W. -â¢ elation, and no doubt the members of
the aa will compliment him on the courage he displayed in traveling
over the r I own r --. The story goe* that he will, on his return, re
lieve the law department at its political responsibilities. When he returns he
will obtain a roster of the California Legislature and endeavor to ascertain the
names of the members who can be trusted with passes to give to other
members.
It is remarked to Mr. McCormick' s credit that he conducts political affairs
on a high plane, He was not accused in the East of advocating the election to
high office of a man whom he would not invite to his home. That much can
liardiy ht% said of the Jate political manager. "W. P. Herrin.

HAVANA. Sept. 20.â The strike has
assumed serious proportions. It Is now

:: the unfair treatment they have
been receiving at the hands of the po
a majority of the cart men being

A NEW BALLOON TO WASTE HIS BREATH ON.
BOTH BRITONS AND BOERS CONTINUE
PREPARATIONS FOR WAR.
LONDON, Sept. 20.â Despite all
outward show of calm. Great
Britain is in practically the same
condition to-day a^ \ras >he
T'nited States a few wwks before
the opening of the war with Spain. Be
neath the crust of diplomatic reserve
the military officials are working night
and day preparing for the signal to be
gin hostilities, whether that comes or
not.
England is not going to be caught
napping any more than the Transvaal.
While Lord Salisbury is quietly at
home in Hatfteld House. Mr. chamber
lain is buried in work at the Colonial
Office, and double forces at the Royal
Arsenal and dockyards are straining
every nerve to equip and transport
troops to the Cape.
It may be set down for certain that
Great Britain will do nothing to pre
cipitate matters, and the Colonial
Office lfi far from admitting that the
case is hopeless.
The rer.ort that Great Britain had
demanded the dismantlement of tho
fort at Johannesburg, together with a
material reduction in the armament of
the burghers, the Colonial Office to-day
would neither confirm nor deny, al
though it is much doubted.
Meanwhile the Marquis of Lans
downe, Secretary of State for War
who returned this morning from Dub
lin, has held long conferences with
General Lord Garnet Wolseley, field
marshal, and General Sir Evelyn
Wood, adjutant general of the forces,
and the activity at headquarters is re
flected in the contract, supply and

While rumors of the reassembling of
Parliament are current, the fact is re

Great Britain declared war first and
then assembled Parliament.
This evening the Marquis of Lans

of the War Office warning all subordi

any information whatever without the
authority of their superiors, and call

says, "will be no longer tolerated."
Advices . from Cape Town are to the
effect that the Afrikanders declare that
the Transvaal will not ' yield â  further
and that if the imperial Government
does not recede from its present post
tlon war is inevitable. The South Afri
can News supports the contention of
the Transvaal that the convention of
ISS4 abolished the suzerainty.
According to other advices the burgh
ers are rapidly going into laager, while
the exodus from Johannesburg reached
1000 persons yesterday. The Stock Ex
change at Johannesburg has resolved
to close the moment martial law is pro
claimed, but all current contracts will
be carried out until the proclamation
suspending all business. In the mean
time the merchants are erecting barri
cades In fmnt of their shop windows.
At Pretoria the interest seems to be
centered in the meeting of the Orange
Free State Volksraad to-morrow, which
If is hoped may suggest a modus vi

<Â»n the other hand, advices from
Bloemfontein announce the arrival
there of a large number of members of
the Raad, adding that the result of to
morrow's sitting is already agreed on,
as the Orange Free State will throw in
its lot with the Transvaal, all the Free
State burghers being fully armed and
ready to start at a moment's notice.

ASSESSOR DODGE IN
A VERY BAD LIGHT
Fails to Account for Taxes on
Nine Millions of Property,
Auditor Wells' Demand Upon Hii lor the
Money Is Ignoredâ Matter in the
Hands of the District
Attorney.
ASSESSOR DODGE may soon be forced, if the law takes Its course, to prove
that all the nice things he has been saying about himself are not the
veriest .cheap political claptrap. There is now in the hands of District
Attorney Murphy for legal action the City Auditor's demand upon the
Assessor for the sum of $122.982 04, which Dr. Dodge in his official capacity is in
duty bound, to cover into the city treasury. He has been requested so to do
| by Auditor Wells, but has made no response.
; Dr. Dodge has allowed the impression to gain ground that he is "the whole
thing" in the line of Assessors. Like Katlsha's tooth, he stands alone. Before
he was elected he did a juggling act with a piece of chalk, a blackboard and
an assorted lot of figures that would have made Herrman's head swim. He be
gan then to say nice things about himself. He allowed his friend and political
sponsor. Mayor Phelan. to say nice things about him. Both have continued un
' interruptedly to say lots of nice things about the doctor and to allow the
Mayor's personal and partial organ to repeat them. They even threw In a few
figures by way of corroborative detail, on the assumption that figures won't lie
and that figures were such prosaic things that nobody would take the trouble
to verify them. But, with all the figures, with the demand of the Auditor for
that $122.982 04, Assessor Dodge has not turned that sum into the city treasury,
and the fact remains that until he does he is not the lily white Assessor he
would have the public believe.
Last week Assessor Dodge said some more nice things concerning himself.
They were contained in a supplement to his regular report and filed in the
Clerk's office. In it is the following passage, which, one familiar with the work
ings of the office would think, would have refreshed his memory about that
$122,982 04, although he carefully avoids all mention of it:
ThÂ» total assessment roll for the year 189?, after making the corrections and deduc
tions authorized by your honorable body, amounts to 111.615, as against $332,344,061 for
the year 189*. or an increase of $. r 2. "57,554 over the assessment of last year. As the total
assessment of real estate is $344. less this year than the assessment of real estate for
the year IÂ«9S it follows that the marked Increase in the assessment roll has been obtained
through the Increased assessment of personal property.
"Personal property!" That's just where the rub comes in on Assessor Dodge.
He says: "It follows that the marked increase in the assessment roll has been
obtained through the increased assessment of personal property." That is the
first statement that proves, in connection with Auditor Wells' demand on Asses
sor Dodge for $122,952 04, that the Assessor is all right on a blackboard and all
wrong in the office. It opens the way to show that, while Dodge has been all
along patting himself on the back for the good thing he says he is. he is far and
away behind his predecessors in the diligent conduct of his office. In other words,
it makes plain that, while he is the very deuce when It comes to assessing, ho
is only a two-spot on collections. <
The sum of $122,982 04 in question represents the tax on personal property of
the value of 59,330,953 which Dodge assessed all right, but which, it seems, he has
failed to collect. It will be noticed In passing that it is on the Increased assess
ment of personal property that the phenomenal Assessor prides himself. When.
one stops to consider that, notwithstanding this herculean effort the city treasury
is shy just $122,982 04, it is plain oa the face of it that figures won't lie even for
"Juggler" Dodga' and 1122,982 04 is facing him for explanation. , .. ___
The law that demands this explanation is very plain and under it Auditor
Wells has acted. It reads:
Within fifteen days after the first Monday in August of each year the Auditor of the
county, or city and county,^must make a careful examination of the assessment book or
' books of the county, or city and county, and ascertain therefrom the amount or amounts
of all tax?* that should have been collected by th** Assessor in pursuance of this chap
ter, and wbfeh have not been collected. He must then state an account to the Assessor
. Â«nd demand from him that the amount or amounts so remaining uncollected shall be paid
Into the county treasury within fifteen days from the date of said demand. If at the
expiration of said time the Assessor has not settled for and paid said amount or amounts
into the treasury as aforesaid the District Attorney must commence an action in the proper
court. against the Assessor and. his bondsmen for the recovery of said amount or amounts
so remaining uncollected; and upon the trial of said action- no defense shall be ad
missible except that the assessment or assessments are illegal, invalid or void.
That law has been on the statute books for many a day and some of Dodge's
predecessors have failed to account for sums demanded to be accounted for
under it, but .none tof them have been so lax, have left such a large sum un
covered into the treasury as the model Dodge. Here is the record of three years
taken from the books in the Auditor's officeâ and Dodge says figures won't
lie: -_ . - .
In 1537 Assessor Siebe -failed to account for the taxes, amounting to J5652 63, on personal
property assessed at $686,
In 1898 Assessor Siebe failed to account for the taxes, amounting to 13210 S3, on personal
property assessed at $270,573.
In 1899 Assessor Dodge has failed to account for $122,982 01 taxes
on. personal property amounting to $9,330,959.
How does he explain these figures? Will he tell the people that he was so
busy putting into his own pocket the 15 per c*nt of all the poll tax collected that
he didn't have time to look after the city's taxes on unsecured personal property?
Will he explain to the 44.913 voters in San Francisco, many of them poor men,
that both his hands were so deep in their pockets for the 30 cents he got every
time he gave one of them a poll-tax receipt that he had to let the city's busi
ness slide?
Come to think of it. he will not have to tell them. He is authority for the
statement that figures won't He, and there they are for him. The lowly figures
30 will represent the amount of cents he has taken this year from the pocket of
every man in San Francisco he has hounded for poll tax, while he let slide in
his greed for gain a sum twenty thousand dollars in excess of the sum total of
poll tax.
According to the Auditor's books, to date Dodge has collected poll tax from
44.913 persons, representing a total of $*9,526. His commission, dug out of the
pockets of the poor, was $13,473 SO. Since tha,t entry he has collected other poll
tax, but not to exceed $100,000 in all.
The amount he has failed to collect on personal property is $122,982 04.
That is the Dodge idea of assessing.but it is not the law's. It puts money
into Dodge's pocket, but it leaves bare boards jr. the city's chest. That's the
sort of assessing that points to' a "dummy assessment roll," and says "I done it,"
while poor school teachers have to live on bread and water for lack of pay. It is
the kind of assessing that has swelled the assessment roll to $405,000,000, and
says: "My predecessors ain't in it." And it is also the kind of assessing that
says immediately after: "There is $31,000,000 on which I can't collect taxes. They're
on the assessment roll, though, thanks to W. Podge."
He forgot to count in the more than nine millions to which the District At
torney is in duty bound to call his attention. Take these millions off the roll, and
where is Dodge?
It is now the duty of the District Attorney to find out. Under the law he
should file suit immediately against the goody-goody Assessor and compel him
to give an account of his stewardship of nine millions that strayed while Dr.
Dodge was diving Into the pockets of the citizens for his poll-tax perquisite. It
is up to the District Attorney.

Grand Army Men Are

Sr>eclal Dispatch to Tbe Call.
NEW YORK, Sept. 20.â Determined and
concerted action by the members of the
land parade and the reception commit
tees, backed up by protests from every
quarter, resulted in steps being taken to
eliminate the breakfast to Admiral Dewey
at Claremont from Saturday's pro
gramme and to rearrange the schedule of
events for that day so that the land
parade can start from One Hundred and
Twenty-second street and Riverside Drive
not later than 11 o'clock In the morning.
A letter was received from General
Miles asking New York to keep Admiral
Dewey as its guest until noon of October
2. when the Washington committee will
take charge of him. General Roe will
probably command the land parade, and
after him will follow Admiral Dewey, eÃ

an open carriage drawn by four bay
horses.. Behind him will come Sousa and
his band of one hundred pieces and offi
cers, sailors and marines from the Olym

ron will follow and behind them will
march the men of the regular army.
Governor Roosevelt will be at the head
of the National Guard of New York. Gov
ernors of other States who come here
with troops are to ride at the head of
their men. Governors who come alone
will be in carriag-es in line. Vermont, aa
the admiral's home State, will have the
piace of honor. Other States will follow
i in the order of their admission tv the
Union.
Those States that have so far signified
their intention of sending troops are: New
Jersey. Maryland, Pennsylvania. Ohio,
Connecticut. Georgia, Texas, Florida,
South Carolina. New Hampshire, Rhode
Island, Missouri and Mississippi. Alto
gether General Roe estimates now that
there will be 32,000 men in line. By start
ing at 11 o'clock in the morning the head
of the column ought to reach Dcwey arch
at Twenty-third street an<l Fifth avenue
at 1 o"clock in the afternoon. The last
man in the line should reach Washington
Square before 7 o"clock at night.
Everybody want? to witness the recep
tion to Admiral Dewey. Hotels will be
put to tremendous strain. Housing the vis
iting public is becoming a serious ques
tion. In more than two-thin!* of the ho
tels in the borough of Manhattan all the
accommodations have already been en
gaged for tbe week commencing Satur
day next. Many will not occupy their
rooms until the commencement of next
week, but in order to be sure of having
a place to sleep they have, in some in
stances, been compelled to pay for at
least one week in advance. As one in
stance of the rush of applications for
rooms it may be said that many hotels
have been compelled to refuse each day
from a hundred to two hundred appli
cations for rooms. In nearly all of the
hotels cots will be put up in the hails and
other places for the use of many who it is
expected will be glad of an opportunity
to avail themselves of even such poor
acommodations.
In the matter of supplying food to vlÂ«

favorable. The many restaurants of New2

EARTHQUAKES OVERTURN
MOUNTAINS IN ALASKA
Intermittent Shocks Felt for a
Week Between Bituya Bay
and Yakutat.
By HAL HOFFMAN.
JUNEAU, Alaska, Sept. 14, via Seat
tle, Wash., Sept. 20.â The Alaska Com
mercial Company's steamer, Dora, Cap
tain Johansen, arrived from the west
ward last night with news of an exten
sive and terrible earthquake extending
from Bituya Bay, 150 miles below Ya
kutat, 500 miles northwest into the
Cook Inlet country. It was the great
est phenomenon witnessed in Alaska
since a similar occurrence in the early
days of the Russian traders.
After a short period of darkness the
earth literally sank down into the sea
and new islands and peninsulas rose up
like huge leviathans showing their
backs above the surface. Mountains
were shaken down and their tops slid
into the ocean. The whole was ac
companied by several tidal waves, one
of them fifteen feet high. The shocks
occurred every day for a week, from
Sunday, the 3d inst., to Sunday, the
10th inst., and were felt last Sunday
at Juneau.
Three very hard shocks were felt
here. One early in the morning and
another about 2 o'clock in the after
noon and the third about 5 o'clock in
the afternoon. Buildings were badly
shaken and people ran out into the
streets in their fright. There were
minor tremblings all day long. The
large buildings, such as the Occidental
Hotel, Stannis Hospital and the
churches, shook and rattled like a crazy
ship in a gale. Xo damage to property
was done here or elsewhere. The moun
tains are all in place around Jttceau.
The shocks here continued steadily
from thirty seconds to two minutes. A
gale was blowing at the time. The
eurthquake seemed to be traveling
south and taking plenty of time to
shake up the country as it passed
along.
The most severe shocks were- folt at
Yakutat and Kayak. At Yakutat there
is a large Indian village and several
traders' stores. It is headquarter? tor
minors prospecting in that section of
Alaska and up the Alsek River. Around i
the point of Ocean Cape, at the en- I
trance t" Yakutat Bay, is an island i
named Kanak. This island sank twen- '
ty feet into the sea. At hi.erh tide only
the tops of the trees are visible. Huge

the Civil Service Commission.
AMERICAN TURF CONGRESS.
Opening Session of the Sixteenth
Annual Convention Held.
CHICAGO. Sept. 20.â Representatives of
different tracks and racing associations
of the country, members of the Ameri
can Turf Â«'ongress. met this afternoon for
the opening session of the sixteenth
annual convention. The delegates say
that there are no grievances of special
importance to be discussed, but that
many minor details and revision of rules
will take up the time of the meeting.
17. S. 8. Detroit, La Guyara. Venezuela,
Sept. 20.â Secretary of the Navy. Wash
ington: About 4000 men (Insurgents') now
practically In the vicinity of Valencia; re
cently occupied Puerto Cabello unnp
noaea; Inter evacuated position. The
Venezuelan forces took possession * â¢ â¢

d'Affaires. I shall proceed at once to
Puerto Cabello. Venezuela, to protect

I have arranged to keep in communica
tion with Minister. HEMPHILL.
It is evident from the foregoing dis
patch that General Castro has a for
midable army to attack President An
drade's troops. His action in' evacuat
ing Puerto Cabello after occupying it
and permitting the Venezuelan troops
to take possession is rather puzzling to
the officials in view of the fact that the
port Is quite valuable, both as a ba^se
and as a port through which arms and
ammunition can be obtained. It is pos
sible that Castro thinks it necessary
fissures opened in the earth of the
mainland and steam is said to have
poured forth. Some of these fissures
were three feet across. Captain Johan
sen says that in two minutes the ocean
rose twenty feet above high tide mark
and almost as quickly subsided.
The natives took to the high ground
in terror, and fell on their knees be
seeching the great Father to save them
and their village. This high water
caught up all manner of drift wood,
logs, canoes, etc., and these raced back
and forth and across the bay carried by
strong currents which swept in every
direction. When the Dora arrived at
Yakutat a few days ago on the return
trip the Indians had deserted their
houses near the beach, and were living
in tents on the high ground. They were
still in great alarm.
At least thirty Yakutat Indians
are now in Juneau. having deserted
their homes and all their property fn
seeking safety in flight.
A good story is told on the two Swed
ish missionaries at Yakutat, Rev. Mr.
Johnson and Rev. Mr. Hendrickson. They
wanted to leave, but the Indians would
not let them go. The natives told them
that the Maker of heaven and earth
had his back up and was angry, and
they wanted them to stay and
â 'Sknokum Wah Wah," which means
big pray, to pacify the "Almighty. And
they had to stay.
' Dr. C. W. Chamberlain of Tacoma, a
dentist, who has been copper mining in
the Prince William Sound country, was
a passenger on the Dora. He says that
at Kayak, about 175 miles west of Yak
utat, the shocks were so severe that
the tops of several mountains rolled
and tumbled into the ocean at their
base. This is a sandstone range and
great clouds of dust were raised by the
detachment and the slide. The Dora in
running along her usual course be
tween Yakutat and Bituya, where
there has been heretofore fifty fathoms
of water, stirred up the mud with her
wheel. It was reported that her keel
found the bottom, but Captain Johan
sen denies this. He says that the stuff
the Dora stirred up was as thick as
cream gravy, while the water on the
surface had the usual clear appearance.
Captain Johansen says he feels certain
there had been'a violent disturbance of
some kind beneath the ocean there.
After an executive meeting lasting
nearly four hour? to-night, the congress
gave out a number of decisions.
The Lakeside Jockey Club at Ruby,
Indiana, was refused admittance to the
Congress. The Western Turf Associa
tion, a new racing track at Tanfaren
Park, San Mateo County, Cal., was
elected to membership in the Congress.
Licenses for jockeys were increased from
$15 to $25.

can gather to give final battle to Presi
dent Andrade's command. This con
flict is expected to occur at any moment.
Commander Hemphill did not ask for
a warship, it is stated, and none will
be sent, it being believed that the De
troit will be sufficient to fully protect
American interests. Should the insur
gents succeed in overturning the Gov
ernment the authorities have no fear
that the change will effect the award of
arbitrators in the British- Venezuelan
boundary dispute.
No matter what the governing power
may be, such power will be required to
enforce the award, probably by the
United States, which is certainly inter
ested in the settlement of the dispute.
The decision of the arbitration tribunal
is expected to occur within the next ten

British delegation, is expected to wit

Chief Justice Fuller will be in Wash

ERNEST W. MICHAELIS
WEDS MISS CARRIE LEESE
â¢ Â«
Pretty Ceremony at the Home of th>e Bride's
Parents in Monterey.
MR. AND MRS. ERNEST W. MICHAELIS.
MONTEREY, Sept. 20.â A home -wedding took place in this city this
morning, which, though very quiet, was one of the most noted af
fairs of the kind that has ever occurred hereabouts. Miss Carrie
Leese, daughter of Mr. and Mrs. J. R. Leese of this city, and
grandniece of that famous old Californian, General M. G. Vallejo,
was married to Ernest W. Michaelis of San Francisco, in the presence of
only the families of the bride and bridegroom. The ceremony took place at
10 o'clock. The house was elaborately decorated and a wedding breakfast
followed the ceremony.
The bride, who is a petite brunette of the pure Spanish type, looked
very lovely in' her white bridal gown. Mi.Â«=s Charlotte Michaelis, sister of the
bridegroom, attended the bride and E. Richard Leese acted as best man.
Mr. and Mrs. Michaelis took the noon train for San Francisco, where they
will reside.
The bridegroom is a member of the printing firm of Michaelis Bros, of
San Francisco and a son of Judge E. Michaelis, formerly of Monterey. He
was born in Monterey and lived here until about two years ago.

SUIT TO CLOSE THE
PANAMA SLOUGH
Long Ago Declared a Nuisance at a
Meeting of the Bakersfield
Trustees.
BAKTCRSFTEI/D. Sept. 20.-YeÂ»terday
the Supervisors in special session directed
ihe District Attorney to bring suit in the
name of the people of California to
abate the Panama slouch, that meanders
for over two miles through the heart of
the city. A short time ago the City Trus
tees declared the slough a menace to
health, and therefore a nuisance. The
suit Is to be brought under the act of 1893.
U promises to be difficult to ascertain
who to bring action against.
The slough was at one time the bed of
a fork of tV Kern River. Years ago the
river changed Up course, and ever since
the slough has carried enough water to
cause It to be full of slush and putrefying
matter. Sometimes it is used to run irri
gat on water through, which water is
claimed by Miller & Lux. It is known
th-U he Kern County Land Company
wants it filled up. and Henry Miller wÂ«-nts
It kent open. Complicated litigation is
liable to arise from the action to abate it.

A General Cut in Salaries at the Fol

SACRAMENTO, Sept. 20.-The State
Prison Directors at Folsom to-day re
elected Captain C. Aull "Warden of the
prison for the ensuing four years. They
also decided to call for plans and bids
for the 115.000 sewage disposal plant. The
successful bidder will bo required to give
a bond to guarantee the successful ope
ration of hin plan. Prison labor will be
supplied on the work.
Owing to the Legislature having cut
down the salary appropriation, it was
found necessary to scale down the entire
list. The application of Convict Thomas
Reed of Nevada County for a parole was
postponed for future action.
Seeking His Children.
SAN RAFAEL, Sept. 20.-F. W. Neid
lein, an employe of the Southern Pacific
Company at Sacramento, came here to

he alleges, were spirited away by his
wife. His two boys were located at St.

curred, so the husband says, between
himself and his wife, who happened on
the scene as the boys were about to be
taken.
Neidlein says his 13-year-old daughter
is now In San Jose, and as soon as he
finds her he will take the three children

ONE of the most important matters of national legislation which will be submitted to the consideration of Congress at its next session is a revision of the war tariff, which, through certain inequalities and injustices, has been made
a question of immediate necessity The war tariff, as it is now fixed, has worked a serious injustice upon most of the people of the country. Gross discrimination has been shown in favor of the express and telegraph compa
nies which have been permitted through inadvertence, to escape their just share of taxation. In order to remedy this evil and to establish a more equitable distribution of tax burdens, Congress intends at its next session to
amend the war tariff law and force the shirkers to do what they refuse to do willingly-pay their just taxes in proportion to the value of their holdings and the volume of their business.
The matter is of such -eneral importance that The Call has sent to each member of the California Congressional delegation a letter of inquiry designed to learn from each his opinions on the proposed amendment to the law.
The answers to these inquiries are of vital public interest. Without exception they show that the national legislators, who represent this State, believe that the express companies and the telegraph companies are evading their obliga
tions and are escaping taxation which they should endure. , , , . -iijtj^
When the war revenue law was adopted by Congress there was of necessity considerable haste in the proceedings. The Government needed money, and the bill providing for increased revenues was quickly drafted and
adopted It was natural therefore 'that there should' be certain ambiguities of expression, and some oversights in the bill. The national legislators who adopted the law are frank to admit these facts and to acknowledge with regret that
the express companies and the telegraph companies have taken advantage of the Government's necessity to place upon the shoulders of people, already heavily burdened, new obligations.
These corporations have refused persistently to pay the tax which the National Government decided they should pay. They have forced their patrons to pay the tax and where the injustice was resented the companies have de
clined to accept either messages or packages. In this they have made themselves liable to the forfeiture of their franchises as common carriers, but they have risked the liability and defied the National Government.
This defiance has meant to them a tremendous profit. They have been made defendants in courts from the lowest to the highest jurisdiction and invariably they have been beaten, defeated by decisions which declared that they
and not the business men who are their patrons should pay the tax. On this coast the chief offender and the one most impudent in its operations has been Wells, Fargo & Co. This corporation, in its contempt of the spirit and the mean
in- of the law has outdone perhaps even' other powerful offender in the country. It is natural, therefore, that the representatives of California in the National Legislature should consider the problem of equitable taxation a vital one.
In it, letter to the members of the California Congressional delegation The Call calls attention particularly to the necessity of a revision of the war revenue law and the purposeof the national legislature to make the revision. Refer
ence is made to the persistent violations of the law by Wells. Fargo & Co. and other corporations, and the opinions of each Congressman and United States Senator on the subject are requested.
The answers to these letters are given in what follows. In every instance the reply shows that the Congressional representatives of California are unanimous in their opinion that the telegraph and express companies, and not
their patrons should bear the tax. Every representative of California in Congress believes that the war revenue law should be revised to remedy the evil, and each pledges himself to vote for and agitate such a revision. All are emphatic
in declaring that the tax burden should be borne by the companies and not by business men or private individuals. Those who are familiar with the details of the legislation which resulted in the adoption of the war revenue law insist that
the law intended to tax such corporations as express and telegraph companies, and that the refusal to pay the tax is based solely upon a technicality.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER gl. 1899.
THE LETTER ADDRESSED BY THE CALL TO
CALIFORNIA'S CONGRESSIONAL DELEGATION
DEAR SIR: There seems to be a consensus of opinion that one of the first things to which
Congress wUI direct its energies after convening will be the revision of the war revenue /ate. In
the haste of the preparation of the act to meet the needs of the nation ambiguities of language were
committed which defeated the intentions of Congress and gave the express and telegraph compa
nies a pretext for refusing to pay their just share of the War tax.
] Tells, Fargo & Co. has persistently refused to pay the war tax upon the receipts issued to
its customers, except to newspapers and a few favored shippers, as required by the act of Congress.
The telegraph companies have taken advantage of the defects in the act to shirk the payment of their
part of the tax and thereby force their patrons to bear the burden.
In the 'revision of the War Revenue Law, will you favor an amendment which ivill be de
signed to compel the express companies to pay the war tax on receipts issued to shippers and the
telegraph companies to pax the war tax on all messages transmitted over their lines?
The Call will be glad to receive and publish your views upon the subject. Yours truly,

tween speakers of opposite political
faith that gave spice to the proceed
ings.
At the morning session Governor
Stephens of Missouri delivered himself i
of a partisan fling at the Republican
national administration, criticizing its
expansion policy and declaring that
trusts and imperialism go hand in
hand.
Governor Shaw of lowa took ur> the
gauntlet thrown down by Stephens and
at the opening of the afternoon session j
answered him with a speech that j
brought smiles to the faces of most of j
those present.
In turn Governor Jones of Arkansas ;
put lowa's Chief Magistrate on the spit
and roasted him for using facetious
language at such a gathering. Attor- j
ney General Taylor of Indiana also ]
took occasion to rap the knuckles of i
Missouri's Governor.
There seemed to be a great difference 'â 
of opinion as to the best method of ,
lease of Dreyfus. The latter walked
from the prison to the Boulevard la
Ennp, where he entered a waiting car
riage and was driven to the Vein sta
tion, outside the town. Matthleu Drey
fus mot him at the train and accom
panied him to Nantes.

traveled as ordinary passengers. The
tniin reached the station at S:l7 a. m.
The Dreyfus brothers alighted on the
platform first, followed by M. Viguer,
who inquired if they could have a pri
vate room.
Inquiry was then made in rfÃard to
the Bordeaux train, which they were

i fraining: from any attempt to secure
privacy, t<> avoid exciting: curiosity and
i this apparently succeeded.
BORDEAUX, France, Sept. 20.â The
Petite Gironde says that three travelers
arrived here to-day on the train from
Nantes, one of whom was recognized
as former Captain Dreyfus. They went
to a hotel, intimating their intention to
proceed by the Nice express.
LONDON, Sept 21.â The Times pub

; addressed to Mine, Dreyfus, and rooms
have also been taken at a local hotel.
The lup-frape is marked for New York.
and it is supposed that Dreyfus is going

The Paris correspondent of the Daily

remedying th<^ so-called trust evil.
Some of those present thought that the
State laws now in vogue were sufficient
to control the operations of the com- i
binations complained of, while others J
were of the opinion that uniform laws
should be enacted by the several States j
and by Congress. Some were for the j
complete annihilation of the trusts,
while others favored their regulation.
Governors Sayers and Pingree. in the
speeches delivered to-day, showed
themselves strongly in favor of the first j
idea, as was also Governor Jones of
Arkansas. Governors Thomas of Colo
rado and Shaw of lowa favored the en
actment of laws to restrict the com
bines. There was almost as much dif- j
ference of opinion among the Attorneys j
General who were heard. Governors
Shaw of lowa and Thomas of Colorado

ana left for home to-nignt.

DECREE GRANTING
PARDON TO DREYFUS
PARIS, Sept. 21.â The Journal OfÃ
ciel to-day publishes the decree grant
ing pardon to Dreyfus. In a report
preceding the decree the Marquis de
Galfifet, Minister of War," points out
that Dreyfus has already undergone
five years' deportation, but that as the
law does not assimilate his deportation
with seven years' solitary confinement,
the prisoner would have to undergo ten
years' detention.
The Minister also calls attention to
the fact that the health of the prisoner
is seriously compromised and that he
would not be able, without great dan
ger, to undergo prolonged detention.
The report of the War Minister con
cludes thus:
"The Government will not have met
the wishes of the country, which de
sires pacification, if it does not hasten
to efface all traces of the painful con
flict. It belongs to you, M. le Presi
dente, by an act of lofty humanity, to
give the first pledge of the work of ap
peasement which opinion demands and
the good of the republic commands."

The entire train of three passenger cars

The train was in charge of Conductor

fortunate that the train was slowing

frequently applauded. He said regard

No motive prompted my action other j
than the desire to induce, if possible, con- |
cert of action among such Governors and i
Attorneys General of all the States as 'â

evil, which has become gigantic in pro- |
portions and which, in the opinion of a
very large number of good and patriotic j
citizens of the republic, threatens the !

to the country.
It is true that in some sections money
is plentiful, trade active, speculation rife,
and that certain products have largely j
and rapidly increased in selling value.
This prosperity, however, is born, in a
great measure, of war, and is largely at
tributable to the enormous expenditures
that have been and are now being made
by the General Government for special
purposes and in particular localities, and
bo long as war shall continue this unusual j
activity will be maintained. Considering

Next to the war itself and the incidents
directly connected with it. the wonderful
revolution that has occurred in business
life is calculated to arouse the gravest
anxiety in all thoughtful minds. For the
past quarter of a century we have heard
much of trust formation, and notes of
alarm have sounded again and again to

fense in the Desirelio murder case la about
completed. To-morrow morning the de
fendant will take the stand and explain
to the jury just hew the shooting oc
curred and how young Johnston came to
lose his life. The attempt thus far has
been to discredit the witnesses for tho
prosecution. The first witness placed on
the stand this morning' was Henry Jen
sen, a young man I<s years of age. The
horses, he said, were Dot traveling fast.
When the wagon reached the point op- |
posite the White House he saw a man 'â 
step out toward the road and then back
again. -He did not know who the man
was, but thought it was Deslrello, from
the hat he had on. He was positive that
Desirclio said nothing before commencing
to shoot, that he did not call to the boys
to hold up. as Mrs. Desirello afterward
testified.
After a few more witnesses for the i
prosecution had testified concerning un-
port ant matters, the case for the
people was closed, and Mr. Walker made j
his statement to the jury. Mrs. Desirelio,
wife of the defendant; was then sworn.
She said that she nd her husband left
their home in Baden at 8 O'clock in the
morning of the day In Question, and went
to San Francisco on business. From
there they, returned to Colma, when de
fendant had business at the coursing
park. She did not see him again until
after 6 o'clock in the afternoon, at which
time they mot at the park. They started
for the town together, proceeded a short
way and then went by different roads,
going to the White House and she to
Helli's store. From the store she walked
tip to the White House and . saw her
husband talking with Mr. Murphy. While ;
waiting hero her attention was attracted
by a noise up the road, and soon she
saw the t<*am driven by Vaccari tearing
down on her. She saw her husband run j
out toward it and attempt to stop the
horses. She heard him call out to the
boys to hold up several times, as they
were driving too fast. She then saw him j
start to run after the team and shoot in
the air. The team kept going and lie
after it. Two shots were all she heard.
Wh-.-n she reached the store a crowd had :
gathered aboiitTyOung Johnston, who was :
on the porch, and she- spoke to her |
husband, saying: "My God. Fred, what !
have you done. Have. you shot iue boy?"
To which he replied it was an accident. ,

OPPOSES THE
FILIPINO WAR
Senator Mason Attacks
Administration.
Special DiarÂ«tch to The Call.
WASHINGTON", Sept. 20.â 1n an Inter
view to-day Senator Mason of Illinois
said:
"On the floor of the Senate I shall con
tinue my opposition to the war upon the
Filipinos. l would sooner resign ray seat
than treat a dog the way we are treat
ing those people. , 1 am ashamed of my
country. People make a great mistake
when they say that 1 am against expan
sion. I am not. But expansion by pur
chase or other honorable means is one
thing; expansion by force is another. I
do not believe that there was any neces
sity for this war upon the Filipinos. I
believe that if we had adopted a resolu
tion in Congress assuring those people
as we assured the Cubans, that we had
no sellish designs upon them, we never
would have met with any opposition in
the Philippines. The fact is that we have
given the Filipinos every reason to dis
trust us and they are lighting for their
own liberty.
"Talk about hauling down our flag.
Will our flag come down in Cuba? Cer
tainly It will If we are true to our prom
ises. And the day that it comes down
will be the brightest day in our history,
because if will show that we are a great,
unselfish nation devoted to the eternal
principles of right and honesty. If the
Cubans want to be annexed later, that
is another question. Why cannot we deal
with the Filipinos in the same way?"

DR. KL^ME&'S BEMEDIES. . I
DR. KILMER'S SWAMP-ROOT
Is Not Recommended for Everything.
But it You Have Kidney or Bladder
Trouble It Will Be Found Just
the Remedy You Need.
Kidney trouble preys upon the mind,
discourages and lessens ambition;
beauty, vigor and cheerfulness soon
! disappear when the kidneys are out of
order or diseased.
Kidney trouble has become so preva-
lent that it is not uncommon for a
child to be born afflicted with weak kid-
neys. If the child urinates too often,
if the urine scalds the flesh, or if, when
the child reaches an age when it should
be able to control the passage, and it
is yet afflicted with bed-wetting, de-
pend upon it, the cause of the difficulty
is kidney trouble, and the first step
should be toward the treatment of these
important organs. This unpleasant
trouble is due to a diseased condition
of the kidneys and bladder and not to
a habit as most people suppose.
So we. find that women as well as
men are made miserable with kidney
and bladder trouble and both need the
same remedy. The mild and the im-
mediate effect of Swamp-Root is soon
realized. It is sold by ' druggists, in
fifty-cent and one dollar sizes. You
may have a sample bottle by mail free,
also pamphlet telling all about it, in-
cluding many of the thousands of tes-
timonial letters received from sufferers
cured. In writing Dr. Kilmer & Co.,

UNITED BY AN
ADVERTISEMENT
Strange Case of a Sister
and Brother.
V
Soecial Dispatch to The Call
PASADENA. Sept. 2").â To-day a brother
and sister who had never known each
other were united through the medium
of a newspaper advertisement.
Sixteen years ago Mr. and Mrs. Can
ton died In New York. They left three
childrenâ Albert J., Essie M. and William.
Albert was 12 and Essie 4 and William
j a babe In arms. The grandparents, who
were too old to properly care for the
orphans, took themin charge. Later Al
bert was adopted by a Mr. Wheeler and
! took his name. The girl was adopted by
i a family named Chase and known up bs-
Bie M Chase William stayed with his
'; grandparents and kept his right name.
Time wore on and the children separ
: ated. Albert went to Bridgeport and Es
j sic came to Pasadena, residing with her
adopted mother. Mrs. Sarah K. chase, on
' Park street. The brothers and sister
knÂ«w nothing of each other for a long
time Then Albert, being told about his
i little sister, of whom he had a vague rec
ollection, had a desire to see her. He
found she had loft New York and come
to the Pacific Coast. Twice he traveled
across the continent to find her and re
turned unsuccessful. Then he advertised
In a New York newspaper. A relative
I of Mrs. Chase, now living in Stratford.
â  Conn read the advertisement, which
! stated that Wheeler\s former name was
' canton, and gave all the facts he knew
' about the family. The relative wrote to
i him and said that Essie was living with
Mrs. Chase here. Essie is quite well
i known here as Essie Chase. Albert has
! been corresponding with her and they
have compared notes which prove them
ito be brother and sister. Their meeting
i to-day was a strange one.
MAYORS DISCUSS
MUNICIPAL WELFARE
Atlanta, Ga., Delegates Working to
Secure the Convention for
Their City Next Year.
SYRACUSE. N. T.. Sept. 20.âDele
gates to the convention of the League
of American Municipalities were late in
assembling to-day. Prior to the ses
sion representatives of Charleston, S.
C. ; Atlanta, Ga., and Peoria, 111., busied
themselves in soliciting support of the
claims of their respective cities for the
convention next year. Secretary Gilki
son announced that forty Mayors have
registered and 114 cities have represen
tation at the convention.
Mayor J. A. Johnson of Fargo, N. D.,
discussed "Special Assessment for City
Work," reviewing the laws authorizing
such assessments in various countries,
but more particularly those pertaining
to such legislation in the United States.
Of the forty-five States in the Union,
fnrty States and one Territory had laws
permitting the levying of special as
sessments to pay for local or special
improvements. Some difference existed
as to the method of procedure among
so many States, but the main principle
of special assessments was recognized
in them all.
Other interesting addresses were
made.

BIG SLUMP OCCURS
IN MILLING STOCK
Sensation in Wall Street Caused by
the Recent Death of Miller
Pillsbury.
NEW YORK, Sept. 20.â Wall street
was treated to a sensation to-day by
the United States Flour and Milling
; shares. Cm Tuesday the common stock
! closed at 66. To-day It sold at 24. The
i preferred, which closed at 75 on the pre-
' ] ceding day, dropped to ;"0. Their net
I declines for the day were 3 to 25 points,
| respectively. These breaks were made
\ on light transactions, only 1100 shares
I of the common and 1300 shares of the
preferred changing hands. The street
was much exercised over the declines,
j although very little of either stock is
held by commission houses or by spec
ulators at large.
The cause of the slump of the Flour
i and Milling was the liquidation of long
I stock partially by insiders and the
withdrawal of all inside support. Offi
cers of the company stated that certain
! insiders who have had buying orders
: In the stocks ever since they were listed
1 found that the general weakness of the
I stock market was inducing liquidation
; by trade interests, and that the death
of ('. A. Pillsbury might also lead to
' liquidation. They consequently with
drew their orders and left the stocks
to take care of themselves.
Thomas A. Mclntyre, treasurer of the
company, who is regarded in Wall
I street as the most important of the di
i rectors, said:
"There is no real reason for such a
I decline. There is nothing that war
i rants it and present prices by no means
| express the value of the stocks. We are
j making money. Present earnings are,
' however, surplus for the common stock.
! I do not think that insiders will long
neglect the opportunities presented by
j the slump."
SPORTING CLUBS HAVE
FORMED A TRUST
New York Promoters of Pugilism
Enter Into an Agreement to
Pool Issues.
NEW YORK, Sept. 20.â The metropol
itan clubs devoted to pugilism to-day en
tered into a hard and fast agrwtnent,
which practically amounts to the pooling 1
of issues and earnings. The combine of
these clubs was formed at a meeting held
this altt-riioon, at which wore present rep
resentatives of W. A. Brady and Martin
Julian, who control the Coney Island
Sporting Club, George F. Considine of the
Broadway, and Thomas O'Rourke of the
Lenox Athletic Club. Other clubs repre
sented directly or indirectly at the meet-
Ing were the Westchester, Waverly, Peli
can, National and Greenwood.
After tile meeting it was announced
that all of the. international battlvs
nch< 'iulod to take place at Coney Island
will be transferred to the Lonnx Athletic
Club. The <mly l>ig bout that, will be de
i tded at Coney Island will be the battle
between Jeffries and Sharkey.
The pooling of these interests will make
very little difference to the public, but
it is expected that the purses will be cut
and that miarantees will be done away
with. Fighters will have no opportunity
now ci breaking their contracts with a
rlub, and it is the intention to blacklist
any one guilty of this offense.

CASHIER BEATEN
WITH A HAMMER
Brutal Attack on an Old
Man in Palatine.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CHICAGO, Sept. 20.â Frederick J.
Filbert, the aged cashier of the Pala
tine Bank, in Palatine, 111., twenty-six
miles north of Chicago, is lying close
to death as the result of an attack
made upon him to-day by a young man
who gives the name of Walter Lawton.
The latter, who is unknown to any
body in Palatine, and apparently of
good education, is in the County Jail
suffering from a bullet wound in the
abdomen, which will probably prove
fatal.
Henry Plagge, 70 years of age, a
farmer, whose intervention at a critical
moment prevented the outright murder
of the cashier, is at his home, west of
the village, cut and bruised and dis
abled, as a result of his struggle with
Lawton, whose motive for the assault,
according to his repeated statements,
was not robbery.
The attack upon Filbert was made
with a tack hammer, and the cashier
was struck at least a dozen times be
fore Plagge interfered. The attack oc
curred at 3 o'clock in the afternoon.
Cashier Filbert was alone in the bank
when Lawton, whom he recognized as
a visitor of last Friday, who had
eought a loan on a supposed farm, en
tered. Lawton called Filbert into the
outer office to consult a map which
hung on the wall, and started a quar
rel. Filbert is small and feeble and
could offer little resistance to Lawton,
who pounded him savagely on the head
with a small tack hammer.
Repeated blows from the sharp ham
mer cent the old man to the floor, but
his cries attracted Farmer Plagge. As
the latter entered he was met by Law
ton, who said: "Filbert is in the back
room and I guess there is something
the matter with him."
Plagge pushed open the door, and as
he stooped over the prostrate cashier
Lawton struck him three times on the
back of the head with the hammer.
The old farmer turned on his knees and
grasped his assailant about the legs.
Both fell to the floor and struggled for
the possession of the hammer.
Each in turn received blows with it
until Lawton drew his revolver. The
men fought for the weapon, and in the
scuffle for it It was discharged, the ball
striking Lawton in the abdomen.
Plaggo said he had no idea of how the
revolver was discharged.
The wound weakened Lawton so
much that, although ho still fought.
Plagge had little trouble in throwing
him to the floor and holding him until
assistance arrived.
The crowd which gathered rapidly
after the pistol shot separated the two
men and took the supposed robber to
the village look-up. He was too severe
ly wounded to offer any resistance, and
this fact was all that saved him from
violence at the hands of the excited
crowd that followed him to jail.

Is Confident of Securing an Acquittal
on the Ground of Temporary
Insanity Caused by In
toxication.
Sueclal Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, Sept. 2n.â George Suisser,
who killed Sheriff Farley of Monterey
County in cold blood, still maintains his
braggadocio manner. He laughs and chats
about the killing, ajid his (.-rime appears
to be a light matter to him. To-day he
said he killed Farley by mistake, but
reiterated that it was his intention to
kill Delaney and Allen.
This forenoon Constable Allen of Sa
linas visited the jail and demanded
Sui?ser, whom he stated he wanted to
take back to Salinas, He presented a
warrant for Suisser, charging him with
the murder of rarley, which had been
sworn to by ex-District Attorney P. E.
Zabaja. I'nder Sheriff Varcoe and Jailor
Rives refused to turn over the prisonei
t<> the Constable. Coroner Muller, who
jis acting Sheriff since Farley's death,
was communicated with by telephone,
i and he told the officers to hold Suisser.
He has another warrant for the murderer,
; and besides he did not deem it wise to
1 bring him back to Salinas. Allen was
greatly disappointed.
Constable Allen went in to see Suisser,
and the latter expressed his opinion of
j the officer in not very elegant language.
, He told Allen that he had been hounding
him for tin- purpose of milking a few dol
lars in fees. "1 would have killed you,
! all right, if it had not been dark and
foggy. When I shot all 1 could see was
I the flash ot your pistol. You are not big
enough to take me bark to Salinas, for
] would beat the face off you. You could
never take me alive."
Suissf-r says he is unable to account for
; the killing of Farley. He says he did
, not know that that officer was looking
for him. Allen and Nesbitt he knew were
j after him, and he supposed he was shoot
ing at those officers. He claims he phot
i to protect himself, as the officers had no
right to go after him, as he had done
nothing.
Suisser says he will not plead crullty
and will fight for his life in the courts.
He has not engaged attorneys yet, but
expects to secure able counsel. His plea
will be temporary insanity, caused by
drink and persecution. When drinking
he says he becomes insane, and all the
people in Salinas know it. He intimates
the officers should have steered clear of
I him while he was in this condition. He
| will also attempt to prove Farley's death
i was accidental, and that he merely re
turned shots that were fired at him in
defense.
Constable Allen returned to Salinas this
afternoon.

IMPORTANT STREET DECISION
A Contractor's Ignorance of the Law-
Causes His Considerable Loss.
William Ede, a street contractor,
brought an action in the Superior Court
against Joseph Cuneo and other property
owners for the foreclosure of a lien
against their property on a street assess
ment. In tl, - lower court Ede received
judgment. Final judgment was defeated
for the reason that the City Engineer
had never made an engineers certificate
of the work. It seems that the Super
intendent of Streets had tiled the assess
ment, diagram, warrant, and what pur
ported to be the engineer's certificate,
which had never been made. Notwith
standing that this was not duly, prop
erly or legally recorded, the contractor
went on with" the assessment. The Su
preme Court takes the position that pro
ceedings in street assessment are purely
statutory.
When the contractor found that there
was an irregularity in the record he
should have demanded his right, that the
engineer's certificate should be a part of
the record. He went on and accepted
such documents as the Street Superin
tendent delivered to him. In falling to
so do he lost his case. The opinion, which
is of no small importance, was written
by Justice Harrison and concurred in by
Justices Henshaw. Temple and McFar
land. Chief Justice Bcatty and Justice
Van Dyke dissented on the broad ground
that because the Street Superintendent
failed to perform his duty the contractor
should not be made to suffer the loss of
his labor and material.
- â  â¦ â¢
Rough on the Contractor
Joseph Wtstall, a street contractor, is
paying dearly for his ignorance of the
law. After performing the work ot a
certain street Improvement he sued Lud
wig Altschul and others for the assess
ment. In the lower court he won, but
the judgment was reversed by the higher
court because of certain informalities
and irregularities in the procedure. On
the remittltur going down he caused the
action to be dismissed and began an ac
tion for a reassessment. Again he won
in the lower court and again he lost in
the Supreme Court, which yesterday re
versed the decision on the ground that a
reassessment can only be made ninety
days after a linal judgment and a re
versal of a case in the Supreme Court
Is not a final judgment. Under these cir
cumstances he is shut out from recover
ing for his work by the statute of limi
tations.

Ten Minute Service to Continue
Superintendent Jordan of the butro elec
tric railroad line from Central avenue to
the Cliff House has issued orders to the
division superintendents to continue the
schedule of service during the winter
months which means that ten-minute
service will be continued during the en
tire winter, as was the case during the
summer months. Heretofore it was the
custom to take off two cars during the
winter and run fifteen-minute cars, but
this year Superintendent Jordan will con
tinue the summer schedule throughout
the entire year.

OUR IRRIGATION PROBLEMS.
W; HILE the petition to the Secretary of Agricul
ture requesting him to have El wood Mead be
ns of the department into
is ot the country, by an examina
e of California, has not been wholly com
ith, enough has been granted to be gratifying
petitioners. -Mr. Mead's sen-ices will be re
ington for the general supervision -jf
the work, but Professor H. H. Hirst of the University
i has been deputed to direct the investiga
tions here, and provision has been made for the em
ployment of assistants as far as may be necessary to
procure the prompt completion of the work.
It would have been pleasing, of course, to have had
Mr. Mead make the California investigations in per
son, since as the official chosen to make the inquiry
he could have acted with more freedom than a sub
te and probably would have carried out the
work on a more comprehensive scale, but in other
respects the change is hardly to our disadvantage.
Professor Hirst has a larger acquaintance with the
State than Mr. Mead, is already familiar with many
in the irrigation problems his chief would have
â¢ iearn, and has naturally a keener interest in
:;ia. These advantages largely counteract any
disappointment that results from not having the chief
of the investigation to conduct the work in
and the petition, therefore, may be regarded
iving been virtually granted.
The benefits to be derived from the inquiry are
many. The Government furnishes the money re
quired to employ competent men to make a compre
hensive survey of the State and a careful study of all
the conditions that affect irrigation enterprises. When
the information is obtained, collated and digested, it
will be much easier for us to devise means for over
coming all the difficulties, whether natural or legal,
that now prevent the extension of irrigation on a
large scale in many sections of the State where it is
needed.
It is safe to say the two issues of greatest moment
to Californians are the protection of forests and the
conservation and economic use of watercourses. The
two things are but parts of one and the same problem,
and on the proper solution of that problem depends
not only the development of our prosperity, but its
maintenance. All intelligent men understand the im
portance of entering at once seriously upon the task
of dealing with those issues in a scientific manner,
and it is a matter of no little satisfaction that the
National Government has given its aid in obtaining
the data from which conclusions can be drawn as <o
the best methods of overcoming the difficulties in the
way.
As was expected, the story of the private soldier
sent to prison by General Otis for writing a letter to
the general has been explained by later information,
and it appears the reason for his imprisonment is not
that he wrote the letter but that he forged the names
that were signed to it. The papers that have made
the story an occasion for attacking Otis owe him an
apology, but they won't give it.
The war that Shakespeare knew may be the same
article that is threatening in the Transvaal, but there
it room to doubt it. The Bard of Avon wrote of the
kind that had a wrinkled front. The Boers may be
preparing to serve out that sort, but they have put
whukert on it to deceive somebody.
It will be noticed that, among the names of rail
road presidents declaring themselves in favor of doing
away with the pass system Collis P. Huntington's
does not appear. Its absence may be taken as an
indication that the Southern Pacific is still in politics.
Dreyfus has been pardoned, Guerin has surrendered.
The incident is closed, and Paris is now prepared to
welcome the world to her great exposition and enter
tain the visitors with the most attractive show of har
mony on record.
Over at Oakland they are holding a "birdless" hat
show. Milliners are hopeful that this end of the cen
tary innovation will become popular with femininity
simultaneously with the advent of the moneyless
purse.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL. THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 21, 1899.
CONSUMPTION QUARANTINE.
SINCE the proposition to qnarantine consump
tives was made by our State Board of Health
much desirable discussion has been stimulated
all over the country.
The disease is costly to civilization and appalling
in its results, because it strikes at human life in its
i most useful period. The diseases of senility, which
find in the weakness of old age an invitation to at-
I tack, strike at victims whose years are near accom
plished. Society has benefited from their physical
strength and mental vigor, and, these being ex
hausted, being already invested for the good of the
world, their call hence is a scene around which grati
tude for the past mourns sincerely, but society is not a
loser. "The young may die; the old must," is the
statement of a physical fact, and not a cynicism.
Medical science does its duty to the world by striv
ing to curb juvenile mortality. The odium of urban
life is the frightful mortality of children, not the nat
ural passing of the aged. The strength of states is
undermined when the young die in masses. What is
sorrow to a family in which children perish untimely
finally becomes to the commonwealth a menace.
When vital statistics are carefully kept and the birth
rate and juvenile death rate can be compared, the
future of a state can be accurately predicted and the
hour of its fall foretold. It is in this aspect that con
sumption is invested with a peculiar terror, and herein
is the interest of the state in its extirpation. It is a
scourge of the young. The period of its assault lies
in the twenty years between the ages of fifteen and
thirty-five.
This is the acre of adolescence and accomplishment.
The dynamic force of a nation is in its people between
those asres. Not only is that the period of their best
preparation for usefulness, but it is the period in
which the fullness of their strength passes into the
generations to be. Within that period are the pa
rental years, and the endurance needed in the nurture
of the young. Therefore, when consumption smites
a life it strikes society and the state. If it remove a
life before it reaches its majority parents may be left
forlorn for need of children to lean upon and depend
upon. Indigence follows, therefore, in the ghastly
train of consequences. If the disease cast its awful
shadow upon parents it falls across the cradle, and
infant life inherits constitutional weakness and is or
phaned at one blow.
An investigation of the final cause of crime, in
a high percentage of cases, finds behind the criminal,
poverty, and next behind its squalor, death, and next
in rank behind the grim specter gnaw the diseases
that slay between the ages of fifteen and thirty-live.
No social prudence, nor statutory care, nor institu
â  rt. can effectively replace and substitute the
;n the chain of cause and effect, which is broken
by the preventable diseases that destroy in that period
of twenty years. It is, therefore, the span which
science must patrol as a sentry, set to guard the life
of the state against an enemy.
We teach law and medicine in our State universi
ties â why? That the State may train men and women
to defend it in the war against crime and the war
against death. It is not merely to equip them, at
public expense, to make personal profit in a learned
profession, but to raise up a loyal guild whose mem
bers shall save to the State the strength of its people
in their most serviceable years, and shall preserve its
noblest crop, its oncoming men and women. Every
life saved in that period of twenty years economizes
for the State by lessening the risk of indigence and
shortening the calendar of the criminal court. In
place of paupers to be fed and criminals to be chained
it puts men who walk uprightly, filled with the sap of
life, gendered by a stout ancestry, and to be the fore
bears of a strong posterity. In these interests the
State takes its jurisdiction and derives among its po
lice powers the right to curb an endemic infection.
We have no doubt, as a proposition of law, that the
State can enforce isolation, the disinfection of sputum
and other useful sanitary rules, to limit the infection
of consumption. Typhoid fever is a secondary
scourge, but the police statutes of the State canonize
against the pollution of potable waters by dejections
and other means of charging them with the microbe of
typhoid. The State makes such pollution a misde
meanor and lays upon it a heavy hand. But the
State, as yet unawakened to the fact that pollution of
the air is easier than pollution of water, has no statute
against excretion of sputum in the street filled with
vital germs of consumption that are sure to reach the
air passages of unsuspecting hundreds, to find their
first lodgment and germinate in the larynx, produc
ing that peculiar sore throat that foreruns consump
tion, from there to spread and destroy the lung. The
State provides inspectors to watch the moths that
deposit germs in the bloom of fruit trees, whence is
sue worms that penetrate and destroy the pulp. The
origin and progress of the bacilli of consumption are
not widely different.
Of course a State quarantine raises a series of inter
esting legal questions. It is a restraint of personal
freedom. If established its first case would take out
a writ of habeas corpus, and the issue would go to
judicial trial. A decision would probably overthrow
the quarantine, but it would greatly illuminate the
problem and be of inestimable value in focusing
public attention upon its importance.
Hon. John Barrett, former Minister to Siam, is au
thority for the statement that Secretary Hay warned
him, just prior to his departure from Washington, to
be careful of his utterances, the inference left to be
deduced being that Barrett might unthinkingly let
out a state secret or two. Let Secretary Hay be as
sured to the contrary. A? long as Mr. Barrett pep
pers the intellectual feast he offers with the liberal
doses of the personal pronoun he has used so far on
his tour the country is safe.
THE WASTE OF THE FORESTS.
SOMETHING of gratification will be felt by all
who appreciate the value of our forests in the
announcement that the Government has under
taken a thorough investigation of the forests on the
national reserves with the intention of prosecuting
all persons guilty of wasting them or illegally cutting
timber from them.
One of the officers of the Government employed in
the investigation who has been at work in Washing
ton reports the discovery of extensive frauds car
ried out by timber companies under the forms of law
and with such cunning as will seemingly prevent
their prosecution. The inspector in describing the
operations of the frauds is reported to have said:
"Prior to the establishment of reserves many thou
sands of acres of valuable timber lands were patented
by logging and lumber companies. To such as held
deeds the Government offered to give an equal acre
age of timber lands at other points, but neglected to
set a date of exchange. These great companies at
once put to work an extra force of men and by keep
ing them hard at work soon had their patent cleared
of all timber; then under the law they presented the
land to the Government, selecting in return the most
valuable timber land that could be secured. In other
words, they have been 'double shooting the turn.' and
in many cases where it was the intention of the Gov
ernment to preserve a timbered area it has on its
' hands nothing but a stump acreage wholly devoid of
material for parks."
Of course where cutting has been done in that way
it will not be easy to prove criminal intent on the
part of the crafty companies. The Government was
at fault in giving them the option to exchange their
lands for others at any time that suited their con
venience. Naturally they have taken advantage of
the option to make all the profit possible without re
; gard to the waste of the forests or the fairness of the
exchange.
While it is not likely anything can be done to
prosecute past offenders in that way, it will be in the
power of the Government to prevent similar frauds in
the future, and that appears to be the intent of the in
vestigation. The work of prevention, moreover, can
not be undertaken too early, for, as the inspector
says: "The forest reserves of Western Washington
are badly broken up, and it will take years of culti
vation and care before they are as good as those in
the eastern part of the State, which were not so heav
ily patented when the law was passed."
The activity of the Government in this respect is
the more gratifying because it is in line with the gen
eral movement for forest protection throughout the
Union. Of course the National Government cannot
act everywhere, but it can set an example to the
States which those that are under the control of en
lightened legislators will follow.
By way of preventing white men from marrying all
the heiresses in the tribe the Chickasaw Legislature
has fixed the license for such marriages at $iooo.
; and the example might be followed with profit in New
York to check the drain of rich girls from that city
by titled Britons.
GOVERNMENT IN ASIA.
THE country needs that men who influence pub
lic opinion stand by their guns. President
Schurman of Cornell says now: "I consider
it a pity that the Filipinos do not recognize that the
best thing in the world for them would be to acknowl
edge American sovereignty."
When sovereignty has to be forced upon a people
, by conquest and arms, no matter if it appear to the
sovereign the best tiling in the world for the subjects,
they never take it that way. Therefore it has to be
: maintained over them by force. The sovereignty, oi
' necessity, becomes a military despotism, and the
. slightest relaxation of military vigilance is at once
met by an outbreak and armed resentment We are
going to put down existing resistance in the Philip
pines. There is no doubt of that, but when it is done
we are over only the least of our troubles in that
â  quarter. American contempt for what we regard as
i the inferior races was never more active than now.
It seems to be an established trait in our national
character. It is that sentiment which made our men
in the Philippines feel that the natives had none of
the rights of human beings on the soil where they
', were born. Holding others and inferiors in subjec
tion has never yet deepened the noble characteristics
of any people. The master has always degenerated
and the subject has always suffered.
In August, 1898, President Schurman said: "This
republic, whose soul is self-government, does not
want Asiatic dependencies or the military despotism
they would entail. The proximity of Cuba made its
misgovemment our affair, but we are not called upon
to rectify the tyrannies of India or of Asia. Nor are
we under any obligations to Aguinaldo and the- in
surgents. Let us keep to our own hemisphere, seek
ing only naval stations in the Oid World."
As Commissioner Schurman he now counsels a
I course that leads straight to a military despotism as
i the only form of government possible of institution in
those distant islands. The effect of English rule in
Asia was for years the subject of unfavorable com
ment in this country. Now that has ceased, and our
imperialists point to that rule as a model of benefi
cence and an example that lures us to imitation.
One Sunday last May something was said in West- |
bourne Park Chapel, London, to a "British audience
about empire in India. The speaker was Dadabhai ;
Navoji, a Hindoo, who represents an English con- j
i stituency in the House of Commons. He said that as I
the United States, hitherto a devotee of the Monroe !
doctrine, had abandoned it and appeared to share in I
the imperialism of the world, the American people (
would look to imperial government in India as an I
example to follow or to avoid. Then followed a ter
rible arraignment of England's government in India, j
He said: "An oriental despot when he misgoverned
acted, so to speak, like a butcher, and people were
astounded and horrified; but this new despotism of j
civilization rather resembled a murder effected by a
clever but unscrupulous surgeon who drew all the
blood from his victim while leaving scarcely a soir j
upon his skin. Moreover, if under oriental despotism j
the results to the individual were serious, they at
least were not so terrible to the country. A par
ticular victim was no doubt despoiled of his fortune,
but some favorite benefited and the money at least
', remained in the country, whereas the British system
of despotism took away year by year a greater por
tion of the wealth of India, with the result that to
day the Indians are the poorest people in the world.
Lord George Hamilton talked glibly of the manner in
which British empire in India had been built up by
the spilling of British blood and the spending of Brit
ish treasure. But much of the blood . was Indian,
while, as to the treasure, not a farthing of it was Brit
j ish. They had, on the contrary, constrained ,the
wretched natives to contribute the whole cost, and
were still drawing from India year by year millions
; upon millions, to the still greater impoverishment
and destruction of the Indian people. Lord Salisbury
himself had said that India must be 'bled,' and ad
mitted that India was injured by the drain that was
constantly going on in the exportation of so much
revenue without any equivalent, and went on to say
I that the great mass of the people, the agricultural
! community, had no more blood remaining in them,
1 and the lancet must be applied where the blood was
I congested. The lot of the unhappy Indian is some
â  what worse than that of the negro slaves of America
in the old days, for the masters had an interest in
keeping them alive for their money value. But if an
Indian or a million of Indians died there was another
or other millions to take their places and be the
slaves of British officials in their turn. The average
j annual income per head of the people of the British
isles is Â£41; of the people of India it is 25 shillings
(six dollars and a quarter.)"
In other words, England is in India for commercial
purposes, and this country is asked to make Asiatic
i conquests for the same purposes. If these are gained.
j by what different process will they be accomplished?
The British and the Boers are doing as much fight
ing talk without fighting as any two prize ring cham
pions, and perhaps the challenging and counter chal
lenging will end in much the same way.
Coroner Hill has gone to Merced to put in a couple
of weeks shooting rabbits. He might have saved
himself the journey and continued in the city splitting
hairs for the railroad company.

VOTE OF THE FARMERS ON EXPANSION
Verdict of 20,000 Farmers is Against Hold
ing the Filipinos in Subjection.
AS 70 per cent of the population of the United States still live In the country
and the small towns, the opinions of the dwellers in large cities on na
tional questions is of less relative weight than many might suppose. A
plebiscite of 20,000 farmers in all parts of the country on our expansion
problems, which has just been completed by Farm and Home (Springfield.
Mass.). has therefore unusual value. More than half of the farmers who
voted are from the Central West and the Middle States, which decided the 1895
election, and the rest are divided about equally between the New England, the
Southern and the Pacific Coast States, so that the whole country is represented.

MEN PRESENT AN ULTIMATUM
Â«.
WANT AN EIGHT HOUR DAY ON
GOVERNMENT WORK.
Ail Chartered Steamers Must Ec Con
sidered Government Vessels and
Pay Accordingly â The Work
Will Be Done Elsewhere.
â¢ â  . â  - .-- - â â¢ ,
The boiler makers' strike reached the
acute stago yesterday. The men want an
eight-hour day on all vessels chartered to
the Government, and if their demand la
not granted within twenty-four hours
they assert that the rule will be made
to apply to private contracts also. Uncle
Sam, they say, made the eight-hour law
ar.d he must live up to it. A private
contract on a Government ship must be
considered a Government job as far as
the hours of labor are concerned, and if
that point Is not conceded, then the eight
hour law will be made to apply to all
work done by boiler makers.
The above ultimatum was given yes
terday afternoon In the office of the
transport quartermaster on Folaom street
wharf. A conference had been called to
Bee whether some understanding could
not be reached. There were present Cap
tains Barneson and Buuhelder and Su
pervising- Engineer Matthews of the
transport service, H. C. Tabrett, marine
superintendent, and M. Arnold, manager
of the Risdon Iron Works; L. lieyne
mann, secretary; W. L. Criglar, marine
superintendent, and Peter P. Phelan,
head boiler maker of the Fulton Iron
Works; James Ryan, G. Lillis. Jack Mit
chell, Frtd Murphy and J. Furlong of
the Boiler Makers" Union, and John Bul
ger, United States Inspector of boilers.
Mr. Bulger was chosen as the arbitrator,
but in spite of his best efforts he could
not bring the two parties to an under
standing.
Captain Barneson in a straightforward,
luamy manner explained to tne men the
Government's position in the matter.
"Boys," said he, "1 want you to get your
rights as much as you do yourselves. As
far as the Government is concerned, I
think i can promise you, in the name of
Major Long, an eight-hour day and dou
ble pay for overtime. That of course
â¢wIU oniy refer to Government work. On
a chartered learner we have nothing
whatever to do with repairs to the boil
ers, except in the ordering of the work
done. For instance, we charter a vessel
and the lirst thing we do is to send an
inspector over her. He reports that the
borers require retublng, and we notify
the owner that the work must be done
before we will accept the vessel. Now
the owner of that vessel employs whom
be pleases to do the work and he foots
the bill. We have nothing whatever to
do with it, and 1 certainly fall to see
how you can make it out to be a Gov
ernment job.
â¢â¢On the Warren, Arizona, Grant, Sheri
dan. Sherman, Relief and other vessels
owned by the Government you will get
what you ask, but to my mind chartered
vessels like the George W. Elder, Ta
coma, Zc-alandla, Valencia, Centennial,
Char.- Nelson and others should be con
bidered ns outside Jobs, as the owners
have to pay for the repairs."
The boiler-makers listened to Captain
Barnepon quietly and then retired to talk
the matter over among themselves. In
tpector of Boilers Bulger went with them
and the whole matter was gone carefully
over. Mr. Bulger counseled the men to
ir;uke certain concessions, but he lulled
to influence the boiler-makers. They re
turned to the meeting room and gave it
us their ultimatum that any vessel com
ing here to enter the transport service
should be considered a Government vessel,
and the job a Government job.
For this they would demand ten hours'
pay for an eight-hour day and double pay
on that scale for overtime.
"Take care, boys, that you are not cut
ting oft your nose to spite your face." said
Captain Barneson. "I consider that you
are going the right way to drive trade
away from the city. Remember that we
cannot get American tonnage to transport
the troops, and that foreign vessels are
being- chartered in numbers. Remember
that there is nothing to prevent these for- I
eign owners from having their repair |
work done where they please. All we re- j
quire is that the transport will pass our
Inspectors. We do not care who does the
work so long as It is done in a workman- :
like manner. Remember that many of
these transports which the Government is
negotiating fcr are coming from Austra
lia and China, and that If you insist upon ;
your demands the owners will have the
work done at Sydney, N. S. W., or at
Hongkong, and for God's sake don't let it
go abroad that an American workingman !
held up his own Government in an emer- |
gency. '
There was a long pause after Captain
Barneson had finished and then Ryan,
acting as spokesman for the boller-mak
ere, said they would give the Iron works
people twenty-four hours to consider their I
proposals, and if their demands were not
granted In that time they would ask for
still further concessions.
The representatives of the different iron '
works are going- to sleep on the men's de
mands to-night and will give their dcci- I
sion to-morrow. In the meantime the !
steamer Bristol was to have come here i
for an overhauling, but she will now go '
to Seattle, where the work will be done. !
The Glenogle requires considerable work,
but she may he parsed by the inspectors
and the work will be done at Hongkong â 
or she may go to Puget Sound and be
outfitted there. The Lenox that was to i
come here from Portland may remain on
the Columbia River nnd be overhauled
there. All In all. the outlook is not very \
promising: for the port.

San Francisco. September 20, 1899.
Editor Ran Francisco Call, Cityâ Dear
Sir: The Executive Committee of the
JOE COCHRANE, HENCHMAN
OF CHRIS BUCKLEY, DEAD
OLD Joe Cochrane, who In the days of political chaos swung the Demo
cratic vote of the Barbary Coast in keeping with the dictates of the
"Blind White Devil," passed away at the City and County Hospital
yesterday morning. His death was not unexpected. It was simply the
fading away of a life spent in activity and good-fellowship, capped now and.
then and at last crowned with a period of dissipation, A few weeks ago it
was found that this dead henchman of Buckley was ill and penniless. It was
only after vigorous protestations that he consented to be' removed to- the
hospital, he thought â others knewâ to die. He did not survive long- after
entering 1 the public care, and yesterday the end came. Whether or not he
will -'Ind a pauper's grave remains to he seen. He has done much for some,
and !t Is true that he has "done" others; but still there are those who say
that some of the friends he befriended in days gone by should see that his
tomb is not marked with a number, as though he were numbered among the
unknown or friendless dead.
Joe Cochrane. first came to public notice through his efforts on behalf of
Chris Buckley when Buckley's position In the arena of politics was not to be
envied. When Buckley came into power, however. it seems that he forgot
Joe, but Joe never forgot his ingratitude. Deserted by Buckley, but stand
injr'on the name ho seined as a supporter of the "Blind White Dcvi!." he
passed many are hours selling positions on the police force to the passing
"Rubes." For each position/or rather offer, he exacted $400 from the would
be* "cop." No position would be forthcoming and then there would be trouble.
He was forced to defend himself against several of these actions, but always
escaped conviction. ! From the court he would go forth to the street and sell
another position on the force, but finally things became too warm in that
line and Cochrane abandoned the pursuit Shortly after he began the not
unusual occupation of giving the uninitiated experience in the line of police
duty for the sum of **00 each. Buckley for a. time again picked him up. Then
Cochrane spent his wealth grained from many fruitful sources "perpetuating
Chris" At "the same time. Chris was perpetuating himself, banking his
money and buying bonds. Chris is still alive and wealthy, but the last food
Cochrane lifted to his lips was purchased from the coffers of public charity.

Eureka boiler works made a successful
demand for the eight-hour day for work
on transports. The Union iron Works
alone continued to work its men ten
hours. On September 13 the secretrirv of
the i-abor Council, upon the urgent ap
peal of the Boilermakers' I'nion to the
j Labor Council, had Prank A. Hearn
swear to a complaint against the Union
Iron Works for the violation of th~ F.-d
--oral eight-hour law on '.he transport Han
cock, un September IT appeared a state
ment in the newspapers that on the
â  previous day the manager of the Union
ir>>n 'Works ha<l produced before United
States Commissioner Heacock letters
' from Washington to the i fleet that work
on the Hancock was emergency w..rk.
Thereupon the Commissioner dismissed
i the case. At 4 p. m. on the Bame day. the
j 16th, the boilermakers in the- Risdon
â  were asked to go back to the nine-hour
' system. This they refused and the
present strike is the result. The boiler
makers In the Fulton were also asked to
return to nine hours and likewise refused.
The Eureka boiler works, now repair
ing: tho transport Centennial, adhered to
the eight-hour system and its boilei-
I makers are now at work and the Centen
nial will suffer no delay.
Some statements have been made that
POLICE JUDGE THOMAS F. GRAHAM
the strike ot the bollermaUers wni cause
the transport work to be taken away
from San Francisco. There certainly is
no fear of that. The bo'lermakers on
Puget Sound, as well organized as those
here, will Insist on their rights, and be
-. the contractors in this city when
â¢ i nfronted with the loss of this work,
either to Pug^t Sound or Hongkong, will
quickly prant the boilermakers their just
demands.
Professor Ely once said: "The trouble
lies what to do with the twentieth man.
Nineteen employers will grant fair con
ditions to their workmen, the twentieth,
only considering his profits, refuses and
ultimately forces the other nineteen to
his level." Had the Union Iron Works
acted like Its competitors, this strike
would not have occurred.
I am, by order of the Executive Com
mittee of the San Francisco Labor
Council, Yours respectfully.
ED. ROSEN'UKRG.
Secretary.

TTJE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 21. 1599.
BLACK EKE FOR
THE NOTORIOUS
HOTEL NYMPHIA
â â¦ â
North Beach Resi
dents Win a Victory.
â Â« â
VERDICT AGAINST LANDLORDS
TWINKLING STAR DIRECTORS
ARE CONVICTED.
â â¦ â
Jury Takes but Fifteen Minutes to
Reach a Decision â Sentence
Deferred One Week â Chief
Lees May Close Cribs.
The notorious Hotel Nymphla, corner of
Pacific and Stockton streets, has received
what should prove its death blow and the
residents of North Beach who have
worked day and night to obliterate this
festering sore from their midst have won
a well earned victory.
After a tria! extending over a month,
two weeks being occupied in obtaining a
jury, a verdict of guilty was obtained in
Judge Graham's court yesterday against
B. P. Blumenthal, L. P. E. Prey. Emile
i Kehrlein and Valentine H. Kehrlein, who
i with W. 11. Richards constitute the
board Of directors of the Twinkling Star
Improvement Company, the sweet-scented
corporation that ie responsible for the ex
istence of the infamous resort. The
charge on which these men were con
victed was "letting premises, knowing j
that the same were to be used for the pur
poses of prostitution," and the Jury that
rendered the verdict was composed of:
A. L. Alderson, L. Harter. F. V. Peterson,
M. Meyer, Henry Beckman, Edward Bul
lard, H. O. Tibblts, M. Brandensteln, W.
H. Thompson, Paul Keyser, Charles Leist
1 and H. Hopkins.
The penalty is six months' imprison
ment, $r,OO tine, or both, and Judge Gra
ham will pass sentence next Wednesday
unless an. appeal is taken. The immediate
I result of the conviction, it is believed, will
| be the closing of the "cribs" by Chief
Lees, and if this is done those who have
labored so hard to accomplish this end
will feel that their labors have not been
i in vain. The fact that Director Richards
I was not convicted with the rest of the
gang was due to the fact that he could
I not be found by the police.
The evidence adduced at the trial
I showed a deplorable condition of moral
! depravity and the lengths to which some
creatures In the guise of men will go in
order to gain a few filthy dollars. Attor- I
| ney Joseph Dunne, who represented the
defendants, sought to show that his
clients did not rent the premises to the
- unfortunate outcasts who occupy the
I cribs for a few hours each day or night,
but this contention was speedily shown
to be false by their own witnesses under
the rigid and skillful cross-examination
I of Attorney ,T. J. Barrett, who prosecuted
; the case for the North Beach residents.
Blumenberg swore that the Nymphia
i whs leased to a woman known as Lillie
Dale, and the latter took the stand in
support of this assertion, but her testi
mony alone was sufficient to convict the
defendants she was so anxious to shield
from the consequences of their shameless
greed. She swore that she rented the
place for $'.00 a month; that the "hotel"
contained ninety rooms, or cribs, and that
since July 1 of this year the largest num
i ber that were unoccupied on any one day
was forty-seven, and the smallest num
[ ber was thirty. From each occupant she
1 received $3 a day, and the monthly reve
nue amounted to about $4000. This money
i she claimed she kept In her husband's
I safe In his saloon across the street, but
! on cross-examination she admitted that I
i she had not paid any rent, and that there i
was not a thousand dollars In the safe.
1 Of course the defendants expected the
| Jury to believe that they leased the place
to the woman without insisting on the
payment of the rent or without an ac
counting of any sort.
F. Venture was one of the principal
witnesses for the prosecution, and he tes
tified that Blumenberg In soliciting him
1 to buy stock in the Twinkling Star Com
'< pany told him that his scheme was to
i have every fallen woman in the city
; take rooms in the "hotel." It was shown
; that the women who rent the cribs are
I the exiles from Qulncy alley. Bacon piace
! and St. Mary's place, and they were in
! the habit of occupying the cribs but a
few hours during the day or night. They
; had their homes elsewhere. Lieutenant
I of Police Martin and Officer Clark, who
I had been detailed on the case by Chief
I Lees to assist Mr. Barrett, also gave
1 damaging testimony against the defend
ants. The Jury was out less than fifteen
minutes. Judge Graham announced that
he would pass sentence next Wednesday.
The Tight against the Hotel Xymphla
has been waged ever since the scheme to
1 colonize immorality and vice In the neigh
borhood of Stockton and Pacific streets
was rt'-st given publicity. As originally
planned the ?pcon<l Moor of the main
building was intended for a big saloon,
but Attorney Barrett, acting on behalf of
thÂ» residents In th- vicinity, went before
I the Police Commissioners nnd success
fully opposed the application for a licence.
Mr. Barrett also went before the Bcurd
i of Supervisor* when a petition was pre- |
I sented by the Twinkling Star Improve- I
ment Company asking to be- allowed to !
I alter the basement of the building facing
! or. Stockton street, which was to form I
! the west win? of the "hotel," and secured
the nonage of Â« resolution declaring the
| place ft public nuisance. '

DR. SUSSDORF
TENDERS HIS
RESIGNATION
Will Leave the County
Hospital.
DR. HODGHEAD SUCCEEDS HIM
BOARD OF HEALTH SLATE DID
NOT GO THROUGH.
Almshouse Employes Were Listed to
Leave, but Internal Dissen
sions Postponed the
Hegira a Week.
Dr. O. E. Sussrlorf, Superintendent
Physician of the City and County Hos
pital, tendered his resignation to the
j Board of Health at Its regular meeting
i last night. It was accepted and Dr. I). A.
EJodghead was elected to succeed him.
Dr. Sussd./rf gave as the reason for hisÃ
resignation, which Is to be in effect onl
ber 1. that his health is rapidly fail- jl
ing and he is not equal to the increasing I
work of the institution and its likewise I
increasing disadvantages. The board I
adopted resolutions praising him highly I
for his administration and saying that his I
cutiduot of the place had been the most
BUi i essfUl and j>rolitio of good results of
any in years past. Twice before has Dr.
Bussdorf been ready to tender his resig- |
nation, but each time was prevailed upon i
to remain for a time, notwithstanding
that he was a Democrat and an appointee
of a Democratic administration. Dr.
Hodghead, his successor, Is Secretary ot |
the- Board of Physicians of the College of
Physicians and Surgeons and will take ;
up his new duties highly recommended.
The City ami County Hospital and Its ;
disgraceful sanitary condition were the
principal topics of discussion at the meet- .
ing. After Superintendent Sussdorf had |
tendered Ills resignation Mayor Ptaelan
asked him 11" before he retired he weald
not draw up specifications for sanitary :
Improvement oi (he Institution that would i
fit It for the care of the city's indigent |
sick until the new h< spital, which is pro- ;
vlded for In the proposed bond levy, is
erected. In reply Dr. Sussdorf said thai
the only way the hospital could be made
habitable would be to close iwo wards at
a time, disinfect and sterilize them and
reralelmine the walls. He also suggested
that the unsightly board fence around the I
grounds be torn' down and an iron one I
erected in its place. Also, he said, the I
trees should be cut down and the build- I
ings left open to th.- BUn and winds. H< I
said, too, that when t he new hospital is
built it should be on higher and more ex
posed ground and In a more central posi
tion. He agreed to draw up specifica
tions and submit them to the Mayor upon
his retirement from ortit c.
Dr. Sussdorf s resignation was handed
In by Dr. LJarbat. who deserted the meet- ;
I Ing "as soon as It had been accepted. Dr.
! Payne nominated Dr. Hodghead as his
j successor, but only he and Dr. Keeney
â  voted for him. Dr. Coffey voted for Dr.
T. C Mahr. After two ballots Coffey
; came over and Dr. Hodghead was de
clared elected. Mayor Phelan did not
i vote, and explained that h preferred to
leave all sucn matters to the medical
members of the board.
\ wholesale throwing out of Almshouse
employee was on the slate, but did not
carry- -A- caucus of the members of the
board wus held in the morning, but
( offey at that time held out against Dr.
Hodgnead, and Payne and Keeney
would not stand for the Almshouse
hegira unless be came over. Thrr- were
thirty attaches of thi poorhouse who were
scheduled to go, all of them appointees of
the last administration. Captain Keddy,
whose administration of the institution 1
is considered by the board thÂ«- must sue- .
eessful in its 'history, will be retained. '
I There are also a number of holdover !
' employes of the City and County H tspl
â¢ tul on" the Â«late. and the ax will probably
' drop at the next meeting.
I'pon the recommendation of Health
Officer J.awlor a rawhide factory on j
Guerrero street, between Nineteenth and!
Twentieth streets, was declared a public :
nuisance and ordered abated, and a row ';
iof buildings from 834 to 836 Hrannan !
street, belonging to the Treadwell es- ; !
tate. was subjected to the same order, j
Veterinary Surgeon O'Rourke, who, since ;
the discharge if Market Inspector Ganns, |
has been acting in his place, reported ' !
that a number of slaughter-houses have '
tly been erected just over the San
Mateo County line, and are dealing ex- j
cluslvely In diseased beef, which they are j
shipping to Hun FrandSCO in large quan
tities. He said he had not enough as
sistants to stop the traffic, and requested
the board to take some action.
The following resolutions were adopted:
Resolved, That or. and after this date no per
son shall art as Interne in any of the receiving
hospitals of this city unless officially appointed
by the Hoard of Health and assigned to duty
by the jfolice surgeon. *
Resolved. That owing to the gross abuse in
the past of the "star" privileges granted this
department by certain street railway com
panies. It Is hereby ordered that the only per
sons In the Receiving Hospital service entitled
to wear the star are the police surgeon and
eight assistant police surgeons. Any violation
of the provisions of the resolution will be pun
ished by immediate dismissal.
Resolved. That the police surgeons have full
control over the receiving hospitals during
their hours of duty, and no one not attached to
the etaft Is allowed In the hospital except by ln-
Vltatlon or permission of the surgeon on duty.
In the absence of the surgeon his duly ap
pointed Interne Is authorized to act for him.

MAY FORM A
NEW CLUB OF
WHEELMEN
Recruits Expected From the
Ranks of the Olympics
and Bay Citys.
The recent announcement of the new
Jirectorate of the Olympic Club that the ,
monthly dues of the organization would ,
be raised from $.". to $5 has met with some ,
opposition among the rank and file of the .
club, and particularly among the mem- j
bers of the cycling annex. The wheel- j
men are all young men, and even now .ire â  ,
paying about $1 50 a month more than the ,
members of any other cycling club, the
next highest being the Bay City Whe-M- j
men, whose dues are 35 a quarter. In a I- ;
ditlon to the $3 dues, the wheelmen i iy '
21 cents a month additional :.s members
of the annex. This makes a total of $'.'j'j ,
a year, a considerable item In the ex
penses of many of the young men.
An px-presidem of the wheelmen, who ,
ha â  also Ueeti president of the California I
Associated Cycling clubs, crystallised the I
feelings of.'a large number of the mem
bers, when he said in an Informal dis
cussion after the association's meeti'ig ;
Monday night: "On the day I receive a;
notice stating the dues are to be $5 a |
month. 1 shall indorse my resignation on :
the back and return it to the club. I can- \
not afford to pay &i 25 a month to belong .
to a wheeling organization, for, as a mat- |
ter of fact, 1 derive no other beneilta i
from the Olympic Club, because I do not I
have time to go there." The speaker is
probably better able to pay the sum men
tioned than dozens of others In the ;
cycling annex.
Speaking further, he said: "My idea
is that If they raise the dues, we will get j
about fifty representative wheelmen to- j
gether arid organize another club, with !
down-town headquarters similar to those
of the Olympic Gun Club. 1 know that
a number of the old-time Bay Citys are i
dissatisfied with their club just now,, be- '
catipe if the recent large influx of small i
boys into the club, some of whom have
been given places on the board of di- ;
rectors. No doubt they are excellent fel- '
lows, but the men In the Bay Cltya aged
from 28. say, to 3T>. gain nothing mentally
or otherwise by association with boys of [
18 or 20. I believe we could get a score i
of the better. class of old members into;
our new organization. Don't be surprised ;
if you hear of a new club about the â 
middle of October, with an age limit of
25 and dues about $2 or $2 50 a month,
which will cater to gentlemen cyclers
only."
John A. Hammersmith, leader of the i
Olvmplc Club, when Informed of a pos- \
sible defection of members said: "The
new board of directors of the club have
given Its financial condition moat careful
consideration, it has been found that â¢
nothing but heroic measures can save it. .
The club cannot be supported on the ba
sis of dues at $2 50 a month. The mom- i
bers of the board have therefore decided
to increase the dues to $5 on the Ist of
October. We expect to lose a few mem- I
bers, but the increased revenue and the j
new members we wjll receive will more
than compensate. "We will offer many ad- j
vantages to the members of the club
which no other organization could hope
to give its members."
Clarence N. Ravlin. formerly a well
known writer on cycle topics hero, has re
turned from a six months' trip to the
mining regions of Alaska. He says his
prospects are excellent, and he expects to I
return north in about four months.
Jules P. Hancock, formerly treasurer of
the Associated Clubs, was married at St. i
Rose's Church last Sunday to Miss Adah
Averlll of Nevada. They are enjoying a
honeymoon tandem trip in Lake County.
Joseph A. Ostendorf of the Bay City !
Wheelmen, now a resident of Los Angeles,
writes his friends here that he is the
happy father of twins, both bays. The
club "members have wired him their con r ,
gratulations.
GENTRY DEFEATS PATCHEN

OKLAHOMA CITY, O. T., Sept. 2<V â
John R. Gentry won the race with Joe |
Patchea here to-day In two straight
heats. The time was 2:09 and 2:07 respec- i
tlvely.
The pacers were handicapped, the half- <
mile track being an inferior affair of

a heavy wind and rain storm prevailing,
and Ten Eyck won by a length. Time,

HANDICAP
WEIGHTS AND
ENTRIES
Brief Review of Some Likely
Starters in the Big Event
Saturday.
The opening handicapâ a mile, worth
$700 to the winnerâ the special feature of
the racing card on Saturday at Oakland
track, will Bee about as evenly a balanced
field as has yet faced the barrier in this
rich event, The entries and weights were
Issued by Handicapper Brooks yesterday;
and on paper the race looks an extremely
difficult one to pick. On his Sacramento
form Cromwell has rightfully been al
lotted top weight, 117 pounds. During the
State Fair meet the chestnut horse seemed
to have recovered his old-time speed, and
will be hard to beat. Mt. McGregor II
comes next with 113, and Roslnante looks
"well In" with 109 up. The latter mare
has had a long rest and will take a lot
of beating. At Sacramento, Hohenzollern
was both good and bad, and with 108
pounds on his back will be dangerous.
Jennie Reed is greatly improved, and So
cialist has been going great guns at Oak
land in his work. Libertine, no longer
partial to weight, should be able to reel
off a very fast mile with only ninety
eight pounds in the saddle, and Lost Girl,
allotted ninety-eight pounds also, will not
want for backers. On September I,\ at
Oakland track, Lothian downed his field
over one mile and a sixteenth, galloping
In 1:49%, carrying eighty-eight pounds,
and asked to carry one pound more on
Saturday,. has an undeniable chance. The
other lightweights should not be over
looked. The full list of entries are as fol
lows:

GREYHOUNDS AND THEIR
TRAINERS A NUISANCE
Since hare hunting and the breeding
and training of greyhounds have become
a sport the residents of the Richmond
district have been sorely annoyed by the
men having the training of the dogs in
charge. Point LobOÃ avenue by reason
of its soft and spongy surface, together
with the wide range of territory In which
free access is afforded for the sprinting
of the greyhounds, has become a favorite
rendezvous for all the dog trainers in the
city. If the dog trainers had confined
their avocation to the sprinting of the
dogs in a legitimate sort of a way the
f>eople would not have grumbled, but of
ate the trainers have taught the dogs to
run down and kill cats, dogs and chickens
on sight.
This nuisance has become so great that
the people residing in the Richmond dis
trict have petitioned the Chief of Police
to detail a mounted officer to patrol the
district and try to keep the dogs and
their owners and trainers within legiti
mate bounds.
An Incident which at one time bid fair
to result in something more serious than
tbe loss of a cat's life took place on Point
Lobos avenue, where a very valuable pet
dog, belonging to Mrs. Mary A. McCabe,
residing. at 2yf>o Point Lobos avenue, was
killed by a pair of greyhounds out on a
training expedition. The fleet footed dogs
espied the little pet on the sidewalk in
front of Its mistress' house and gave
chase, which resulted In the killing of
the small dog. Mrs. McCabe was very
angry at the loss of her pet, and seeing
no sorrow on the part of the trainers, she
secured a pistol and blazed away at the
greyhounds, wounding one severely, her
only regret being that she did not suc
ceed In killing the two hounds. The shoot
ing at the dogs created quite a commo
tion in the neighborhood, but when the
cause was explained to those who con
gregated they all sympathized with Mrs.
McCabe.
The dog training nuisance has become
so great that the residents have sought
the assistance of the Point L.obos Im
provement Club to aid them in having
the nuisance abated. At the last meet
ing of the club the secretary was in
structed to communicate with the Chief
of Police on the subject.'
THE SAS FKAIN CISCO CAUj, THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 21, 1899.
effort for possession of the America's cup could not be made by a worthier
boat nor a more sportsmanly challenger.
The Shamrock's splendid performance on her first trial in American
â waters is as gratifying to yachtsmen of this country as it is no doubt to j
those of Great Britain. Too long our defense of this intfrnational trophy |
has partaken of the nature of a sail-over. So easy has been the conquest,
indeed, a majority of the times it has failed to provide that excitement
without which a sport speedily loses vital interest.
Many American sportsmen would welcome for several good reasons
loss of the cup this year; chief of them is the tremendous stimulation that
would be given yachting interests in England and in Americaâ for a chal
lenge would be issued forthwith In the name of the New York Yacht Club
and several boats built in both countries for the race. It is not for the j
best interests of any sport that one country or one college or one club
should always win; really in the end such one-sided competition affects
the sporting development of the winner as much as it does that of the j
loser.
â¢ â¢ â¢
When the next challenge is issued we hope it will be with a seventy
and not with a ninety footer. Apropos of which an excellent story Is
timely ami illustrative of the present challengers sportsmanship. Lip- j
ton's wish was to challenge with a seventy, and he so informed the New j
York Yacht Club officials in their unofficial correspondence prior to the j
Issuance of the challenge. On the New York Yacht Club men expressing i

M. Michalik's Greyhound Ac
counts for the Mid
week Stake.
The reserve stake, which formed the â¢
| card for the midweek meeting at Union '
Coursing Park yesterday, was won by M. ,
Michalik's Glen Roy. In the final he met i
the black dog Â£eau Peep. The latter had
the greater speed, but the hare doubled
hack from him, letting In Glen Roy. The
i work was all done immediately In front
ot the grand stand, where the spectators ;
could see for themselves how the tide of |
â¢ the battlf flowed. The course was an un
i usually long one, each dog running up a â¢
1 good pcore.
The afternoon's sport was marred In a
! degree by a fog which, at times, ob
-1 soured the view of the spectators. J. J.
Edmunds' Morning Glory was looked up
on aa the most likely winner of the stake
> until the fourth round, when she met
] Still True. In this Morning Glory scored
i forty-two points to eighteen for her op
â¢ poiient, and finally killed although
an extra dog had been released. She
went out In the next round before Glen
Roy, the ultimate winner.
The most notable upset of the day waa
the defeat of Tod Sloan by Tic Tac. The
former was a 6 to 1 favorite, but did not
run up to form. Boney Boy beat Right
Arm by a score of forty-two to two, and
was then drawn from the competition.

the challenger's privilege of naming any size boat within the deed of gift
provisions- and the Shamrock is a ninety-footer.
Should the Columbia be beaten we could not in courtesy, after such
treatment, challenge with a seventy next year, unless, of course, I,ipton
was quite agreeable; but if we retain the cup encouragement to build sev
enties should be given all futurÂ« challengers. The point made by such sug
gestion is that thereby a class of big single-stickers would be created to
participate in the usual racing of the yachting year.

The most impressive feature of the Shamrock's sailing off Sandy Hook
last week was tho comparatively slight disturbance she made in going
through the water. Evidently there is something in her underbody which
Kives good warrant for the confidence of Sir Thomas and for William
Fife's insistence that she be launched in skirts. Certainly the Shamrock's
performance the other day brought unfeigned surprise to those who looked
upon her for the first time, or had perhaps seen photographs of her under
.sail in the Solent.
There is no doubt the Shamrock was expected to make quite a fuss as
she went through the water. Reports of her work on the other side spoke
of it, and her full bow and heavy quarters suggested it.
But nothing of the kind was visible in her sailing last week. On the
contrary, she went through the water smoothly and with astonishing
ease. Instead of pounding with her full bow and sending the spray high

ALL TEAMS

GOOD GAMES
Changes in the Last Week
Which Bring Nines Closer
in the Column.
The four teams In the league to-day
are approaching a common level of game
with startling rapidity. Three of them
are in the same hundred percentage with
the Dudes still trailing a bad fourth.
The position of Cal Ewing's men is un
fortunate. At the beginning of the sea
son his men played very poor ball and
they made speedy descents down the col
umn which represents the standing of the
teams. As it is now they are 166 per cent
below the leading Senators and nearly
a century behind the Lobsters, who stand
third in a list of four teams. But the
playing of the Dudes of late is not that
of tail enders. It is really equal to the
best and when Sacramento crosses bats
with the Oakland team it will find a much
fortified nine to bat Into subjection. The
Dudes took the measure of the locals in
two out of three games last Saturday and
Sunday by playing the better ball. That
they lost the first game was a matter of
The local team has lost Its winning
stride and in consequence has gone down
the percentage column with a hop. skip
and a jump. The two victories of Santa
Cruz over the Senators have advanced the
Lobsters several stations, and they will

The rivalry existing between teams has
broken out in fistic demonstrations and
this is something which the managers
should use every means within their
power to guard against. The squabble
between Dunleavy and Hildebrand, wh,ile
a personal affair, places their team in
bad odor. One redeeming feature of the
encounter is that it was not on the field.
Managers Harris and Kwing are alive to
the disposition of their men and they
should fine all players heavily who inter
fere with the progress of the game dur
ing contests, when no good reason for
protracted recalcitrancy exists, or when
their men engage in conduct that is hood
lumlike in character.

over her forward dock she rides over the water like a shallow-draught
center-boarder, and does less hammering than any ninety-footer that has
ever come out. of England.
She seems, indeed, to make less disturbance at her bow in a choppy
sea than the Columbia, although the latter has not been seen yet in such
weatherly conditions as those which prevailed during the challenger's first
sail on this side.
Somehow the Shamrock appears to displace less water at the bow than
the Columbia; nor docs water so much boil up on each side of the yacht,
to swirl along her side and under her counter for the making of a consid
erable wake, as Is the case with the defender.
â¢ * â¢
It is difficult, perhaps impossible, to make trustworthy comparisons
without the yachts sailing side by side in the same water and air, but
carrying in the mind's eye the work of the Columbia under somewhat
similar conditions it docs look as though Fife had succeeded in giving his
product an easier entrance, for all its seemingly heavy bow, than Herres
hoff has secured for the more finely drawn racerlike bow of the Columbia.
And the value of easy entrance cannot be overestimated. It might
mean minutes in a thirty-eight mile race over a choppy cross-sea, and it
surely means seconds under any conditions.
Yet it must be borne in mind that no one has viewed the Columbia
under such conditions, or with the rig she was designed to carry, in
weather approaching that the Shamrock encountered on her second sail.

COLUMBIA
FAVORITE IN
THE BETTING
Odds of 10 to 8 Are Being
Offered on the American
Yacht
SDecial Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Sept. 20.â Betting on the
America's cup match has not yet become
active. Now and then wagers are heard
of on the result, but the amounts have
i been small. Before the arrival of the
! Shamrock the inclination was to make
the Columbia a great favorite, and there
were rumors of money being posted at
odds of two and three to one on the home
boat, but it was impossible at the time
to find out who the enthusiastic patriots
were that felt so sanguine that the Co
lumbia would win.
The Columbia still has the call In the
; betting, but it is conceded that the Sham-
I rock is a better boat than any of the pre
! vious challengers. The disposition on the
I part of the Columbia's admirers seems to>
I be to wait for terms not one-sided. Oc
casional bets have recently been made of
10 to S and even 10 to 7, with the Columbia
favorite, but the amounts have not been
large. The bulk of the Columbia money
will not be bet until next week, when the
holders of large sums hope to obtain even
money, but failing in this a point or two
may be conceded to the Shamrock ad
herents.
A prominent member of a city club .lust
returned from London reports that he suc
ceeded in placing Â£200 on the Columbia
there at even money and wanted more,
but was unable to get It. At the time he
made the bet there was only a meager
amount of speculation on the result of
the races.

ceremony about the discharge, and Its
most prominent feature Will be the clink
of gold. Not that the California men will
get very much in the way of money, but
it will be the first paid over to the men In
a long time. The artillery battalion has

It Is some months since the men of the
First Regiment have received anything.
They will get no travel pay. for the men
all enlisted here, and although there is
something due on the clothing allowances
of most of the men, it will not be much.
Before the regiment has gone out of the
service Colonel Duboce will issue a last
order to his men. In it he will recall to
their minds their old service in the guard,
and â  â â¢â¢ will ask that the men stay to
gether, re-enter the service of the State,
and perpetuate the name and fame and
the organization of the old First Regi
ment.
The regtmental colors will be retained
as the sacred trust of the reorganized
regiment. There was a plan on Coot to
have them placed on -exhibition in the
rotunda of the City Hall, and kept there
us one of the treasures of the city, but
Colonel Duboce declined to let them go.
He did not feel justified in giving them
up he uttid, as the old guard regiment was
to be reformed, and he, and his officers,
believed the -colors should be retained by
those who had added to their luster.
They will be carried in all parades, in ad
uition to the new colors the regiment will
get, â¢ and a special guard of honor,
selected from among the men who fought
under â  them, will escort them. Their
place will be in the regimental armory.
.Battery D of the Volunteer Artillery
will leave for Los Angeles to-morrow by

The transport Tacoma, which was to
have sailed at 6 o'clock last evening, was
obtained until this morning on account
of a defective refrigerator. The George
W. Elder left her lock and anchored off
the Large office at 4 p. m. yesterday. She
bailed early this morning. The Twenty
seventh Regiment was distributed be
tween the two transports.
Several small boys tried to stow away on
the Elder, but they were discovered and
sent to the Harbor police station by the
uincers of the transport service. Boys 10

The Twenty-seventh has left Just in
time to make room for the Thirty-second, ;
which will reach the Presidio to-day from
Fort X-eavenworth. Kansas. The Thirty
second is in command of Colonel Louis A.

The -.ran sport Grant will probably take
away the Thirtieth Regiment. She will
coma In to the Government wharf to-day
and the supplies for the Thirty-first that
are aboard will be unloaded. The Thir
tieth Regiment was to have sailed on the
Sherman, but as that vessel has been de
layed by the boiler-makers' strike and the
Grant is ready for sea the men will go on
her.
The hospital ship Relief has been de
layed again. She was to have sailed yes
terday, but fresh orders came from Wash
ington, and it may be, to-morrow before

who came out from the East and the
twenty nurses who were to sail on the
vessel have been ordered to other trans

take on an extra supply of coal here and

LAWYERS SWEAR
JUDGE COFFEY
IS PREJUDICED
Laura James Contest
in Court.
TWO AFFIDAVITS ARE FILED
ATTORNEYS HART AND FOX THE
AFFIANTS.
Both Contend That a Decision Ad
verse to Their Client Was
Reached Through Failure
to Credit Witnesses.
Judge Coffev has again teen charged
with prejudice. Two affidavits making
! this periodical charge againb: his Honor
, were filed yesterday morning by .W. if.
; H. Hart of Blythe case fame and George
j W. Fox, who is associated with Hart in
prosecuting the Interests of Laura Milan
James, the alleged contract widow of the
late Dr. C. A. James, and her infant son,
I Theodore Milan James.
The- charge of prejudice against Judge
I Coffey is the outcome of certain decisions
handed down by the court declaring- the
claims of the .alleged widow without foun
'â  dation.. Dr. James died a few years ago
i at his Howard street residence, leaving a
'large estate. As he died intestate the
property was tinder course of admiliistra
! lion pending distribution to relatives in
1 Indiana, when Mrs. James came forward
and tiled a petition in which she sought
distribute to her of all the estate by
virtue of her alleged relationship.
The case was assigned to Judge Con>y
I for trial, the marriage contract was pro
| duced and evidence to substantiate airs.
James' claim Introduced. Considerable
evidence tending to prove that the signa
ture on the contract was genuine was in
-1 troduced, but Juage Coffej handed down
I a decision declaring the document to be a
forgery. An appeal was taken to the Su
preme Court and the decision reversed,
! the higher tribunal holding that the lower
court erred In admitting certain evidence
' and excluding other.
Now that the case is back before the
Superior Court the attorneys named ob-
I ject to another trial before Judge Coffey,
i both claiming that the court was preju
diced and decided the case against nts
I own opinion. In his affidavit Attorney !
â¢ Fox contends that Judge Coffey. compared
' signatures himself and failed to consider
, the evidence given by experts who j
testified that the one on the mar
riage contract was genuine, the
evidence pi Expert R. C. Hop
j kins, whose ability has been recognized
| by Circuit Judge Sawyer and other dis
tinguished . jurists, being among that
which the court failed to consider.
I Hart reached further into the case in
; his affidavit than does Fox. He says
that he has known Judge Coffey for many
years and that he Is positive that this j
jurist is a man of set opinions and that I
I in passing upon documents similar to the ;
one in question his Honor frequently does,
and especially in this case did. pass upon
the genuineness of the signature from his j
I own opinion and discredited the opinion of j
more experienced persons. He further
Bets forth that the action of Judge Coffey
in arriving at this adverse decision from i
his own opolnions closed an avenue of ac
tion, as "counsel were deprived of the
benefit as well as the pleasure of cross- :
examining his Honor on the subject of |
handwriting." For ttifse reasons Hart is (
confident that Judge Coffey cannot retry
the case without entertaining his opinion
heretofore formed, and hence a transfer
to another department is prayed for.
It is understood that when the motion i '
for a transfer comes up this morning At
torney Shadbourne. who represents the
heirs, will file a counter-affidavit, and the ; ,
contest between counsel, spiced now am!
then by the remark? of the court, will
make an interesting hearing.

Proprietor of the Ahlborn
House.
H. .T. Renner. a visitor from Georgia,
swore to a complaint in Judge Conlan's
court yesterday for the arrest of August
Fehlemelcher, proprietor of the Ahlborn
House, on the charge of felony embezzle
ment, and Fehlemelcher was arrested and

on bonds.
Renner stated that when he went to the
Ahlborn House as a guest he deposited
with the proprietor a roll of bills amount
ing to $640. When he asked for the bills
yesterday the defendant's wife took: the
j-.ill out of the safe, but on counting it he
found that $140 was missing. He demand
balance, but w.a.- refused, and as
certained later that the proprietor had
lost the money in gambling.
Fehlemelcher admits that Renner
handed him a mil of bills, and when he
offered to count it he told him it was
all right. The roll was pirn-â¢} in the safe
and returned to Renner by defendant's
â¢wife. Two hour? later Renner came back
and said there was $140 short. The nll

FIREMEN ON THE
AUSTRALIA GET
WAGES ADVANCED
Back to What It Was
Five Years Ago.
The Oceanic Steamship Company's
mail steamer Australia sailed for Hono
lulu yesterday with sixty-five cabli: and
forty steerage pessengers and over 1000
tons of cargo. This is an unusually heavy
load of merchandise, hut 8000 tons more
would have been shipped could the vessel
have carried it.
The. coal passers and firemen on the
Australia went out happy. A few hours
before ih< vessel sailed they sent a dele
gation t" Captain Howard, superintend
ent of the company, asking for an ad
vance of wages. The matter was referred
to the head office, and an advance of $."'
a month w:is given the men. The w;tKÂ«-s
for firemen and coal passers i? now back
to what ir was flve years ago, and the
men arc in mn?. quence juhllant.
It is now believed that the big pile raft
which broke away from the Czarina has
gone to pieces. The schooner Defender
reports passing through a number of
plies with the nark on, and the Cleone,
when two miles r.ff Caspar, saw two lots
Of them. The raft that was towed in hy
the tugs Rnll^f and Rescue was com
posed of barked piles. A number of them
drifted out during the tow and have since
been spoken. The raft which got away
from thi- Czarina was composed of piles
with the bark on, and it '.vaa probably
portions of it that the Defender and
Cleone saw.
The Cleone towed the schooner Dewey
down from Albion and narrowly escaped
colliding with an unknown collier. The
captain of the Cleone says he signaled
that he had a tow und the collier
answered. Instead of looking out for the
tow the collier cut across the Cleone'9
stern und struck the Dewey a glancing
blow. No damage was done, and both
vessels held on their course.
Lieutenant Porter. V . S. N., has been
detached from the training ship Adams
and will go East in a few days. The
lieutenant is a son of the late Admiral

RECEIVED THEIR BOYS.
Entertainment for the Men
Who Enlisted From St.
Joseph's Parish.
There was a complimentary reception
to the members of the two California vol
unteer commands at St. Joseph's Hall
last evening. The reception was in honor
of those members of the regiment and
the artillery battalion who are members
of the parish of St. Joseph, but there
was no limit to the soldiers who were
to be received. Every one who wore the j
blue was welcome and every one of the
men who came was made to feel him
self so.
A most interesting and entertaining
programme had been prepared, and when
it opened there was not a vacant seat
in the hall. On the platform were some
of the prominent people of the parish and
several of the officers- of the regiment,
and through the audience the bluecoats
were scattered from stage to doorway.
The feature of the programme was an
address by Father McKinnon, the chap
lain of the First, who wove Into a sim- j
ple tale of the life of the men In the I
islands a good deal of information about i
affairs down there. What the soldier
needs, he said, is not criticism, but sup- |
port; he needs the encouragement of his
people at home; he needs more evidences
of patriotism and less fault (hiding. It
Is easy to* tell how to run things down
there, he said, but it Is not so easy to go
down and run them, and In that con
nection he paid a compliment to General
Otis, who, he said, is as prudent and
hard working a man as there is in the
army.
In speaking of the people Father Mc-
Kinnon said there are eighteen tribes, all
favorably disposed toward the United
States except the Tagailos. The Tagal
lOÃ, he said, are treacherous, and as an ;
instance of their treachery he told how ;
they once went into the northern part |
of the island and inviting all the tribes
in the vicinity to meet them they asked
; who was in favor of peace. A vote was
taken and a great many declared them
selves for peace, and the next day the
Tagallos sought them out and killed them
all. The war will last, he said, until there !
are troops enough In the islands to pro- i
tect those who are kept from showing
their allegiance to this country through
fear of the Tagallos. When they are pro- |
tected they will come out as friends and j
then the Tagallos will be left alone and
cannot hold out. There are 50,000 of them
armed with modern arms.
Father McKinnon spoke enthusiastically
of the work of the men from California
and he praised the work of General
Smith, particularly his government of
Negros.
When Father McKinnon came upon the
stage he was given an ovation that few
men can claim. Everyone roÃe and every- '
one shouted, and for some minutes there ;
v.-as no stopping the storm. His remarks
: throughout wen greeted with bursts of \
applause, particularly the persona] inci
dents he told of and the deeds of bravery
he described.
The audience was welcomed by Father
Scanlan, pastor of St. Joseph's church.
The reception whs under the auspices of
the St. Vincent de Paul Society of the I
parish. The programme in full was as ;

by false pretenses. He alleged that he
bought a cigar store at 412 Kearny street
from the defendants on the representa

a matter of fact it was not worth more
than $25.
GRATIA VANCE
HAD A TRIO
OF HUSBANDS
Judge Coffey Hears a
Unique Contest.
SEEKING A CHILD'S CUSTODY
SON OF THE DECEASED IS THE
OBJECT OF LITIGATION.
The Court Must Determine the Pa
rentage of the Child as Well as
the I/=gal Stc.tus of the
Case at Bar.
The contest for the guardianship of Ira
Leroy Vance, chiid of the late Gratia
Vance, was commenced before Judge Cof
fey yesterday, and seme interesting sec
tions of tlie family skeleton of the de
ceased thai have long been closeted were
dragged into i> ibitc view. Ira Lincoln
Vance, who adopted the boy In question,
seeks his custody by virtue of the re
lationship he believes he bean toward
the boy. while Julia Evans Rose, the
youth's grandmother, prays for his cus
tody, claiming that by reason of her
daughters many and peculiar marriages
fhe boy's alfeged father is not entitled
to his custody.
Gratia Vance, mother of the lad whose
fate is now banging in the balance, died
a short time ago leeaving an estate of
some little value. Ira Lincoln Vance
Immediately made application for letters
.of administration upon the .'state and
also asked for the custody of the child.
Within a few "lays Mrs. Rose filed a sim
ilar application, and the contest was on.
Yesterday it went to trial, and through
the testimony runs the thread of an In
teresting tale.
According to the testimony introduced
by Mrs. Hose, her daughter, several years
ago In a little town in New York, married
Frederick Dunne. They lived together for
a short time, and then, for some unknown
reasons drifted apart. Next, without hay.
ing been divorced from Dunne, she be
came the wfe of Orson Debillo Hill.
Finally she drifted away from Hill, but
while her marriage to him was still in
full force and effect she again went
through the ceremony of marriage witn
the petitioner, Ira Lincoln Vance.
It is said that the child Is the natural
son of the second husband. Hill, but if,
as asserted, when she married Hill the
Child's mother was the legal wite of
Dunne, the lad is of illegitimate parent
age. Hill denies that she was the wile
of Dunne when he manod her. He fle-
Clares she wns divorced and that the child
is his legitimate son. Vance claims other
wise however. He says the woman who
bore his name at the time of her aeath
was his legal wife for the reason that
Dunne was dead when he married her,
and that the fact that Dunne was alive
when Hill married her invalidated Hills
marriage, as there was no divorce, in
consequence, he declares he is entitled to
letters of administration and the guarrt
lanship of the child, which, he says, he
adopted, with his mother's consent,
shortly after he married her.
Hill 'has nominated Mrs. Hose as guard
ian of the child, claiming that as the nat
ural father of the child he has the ngat
to dictate as to matters concerning its
future welfare. After Mrs. Rose had
finished her testimony an adjournment
was taken.
FERRAL WAS AGGRESSIVE.
Was on the Verge of Contempt in the
Sullivan Case.
The defense In the trial of Cornelius J.
Sullivan, charged with the murder of his
stepfather. J. L. Pratt, was concluded be
fore Judge Lawlor yesterday. Judge Fer
rel. who represents the defendant, nar
rowly escaped being adjudged guilty of
contempt of court, but he made a point
in favor of his client. Judge Ferral called
Detective Brainbridge to the stand and
sought through him to prove that the
deceased had twice been convicted and
Bent to penitentiary; that once he escaped
therefrom and again was convicted of a
crime against the ballot box in Alameda
County Judge Ferral produced the crim
inal record and although it was objected
to and the objection sustained the
prisoner's lawyer through a series or
side steps, notwithstanding the ruling- of
the Court, managed to get the facts con
tained in the record before the jury. On
concluding his many questions to the de
tective, the record being the basis of
each none of which were answered by
order of the Court, Judge Ferral asked
th-it an exception to each ruling of the
Court be entered. Judge Lawlor refused
to make the order on the ground that It
Still More Counterfeiting.

was too latp. Here Ferral began an argu
ment on the life that rested in his hands,
that he was in court for Justice and for
right and if the Court would not allow
him an exception he would ask the ques
tirins over again. Judge Lawlor quietly
warned him not to take the risk. An
other argument followed and then Ferral
abandoned his purpose, but through an
other series of questions managed to
evade the ire of the Court and seek the
desired information. This done the case
of the defense rested and the introduc
tion of testimony tn rebuttal commenced.
Argument will be concluded perhaps this
afternoon and by night the stand taken
by the jury in this, the fourth trial, of
the defendant will be known.
In the Divorce Court.
Juolpe Troutt has granted Minnie L.
Calvin a divorce from William H. Calvin
on the ground of extreme cruelty. The
custody of a minor child was awarded
Mrs. Calvin. Joseph E. Owings has been
granted a divorce from Sadie V. Owing*
on th*> ground of desertion. Decrees of
divorce have also been granted Mary
Adami from John Adami, on the ground
of extreme cruelty; Catharine Molloy
from Joseph Molloy, on the ground of
willful neglect and Adelaide M. King
from Jnhn H. King, on the ground of i-x
--treme cruelty. The application of Anna
M. Meyer for a divorce from William
Meyer, on the ground of cruelty, was de
nied by Judge Hunt. The court said that
he believed the unhappiness of the couple
was caused by the interference of one
Gottfried TeuFcher. and advised that
Teuscher's interference be no longer tol
erated and they would find domestic con
tent.
Suits for divorce have been filed by
Howard H. Harsha against Louella Har
sha, for desertion; James Little against
Alice Little, for cruelty, and Mrs. M. H.
Wells against F. J. Wells, for failure to
provide.

The Hay Market.
The circular of SonWTS & Co. says of Hay:
"Receipts for the week ending to-day show
a total somewhat less than for the week pre
ceding, the account as Indicated about amount
ing to about 4000 tons, In comparison with 4300
tons for the week preceding. The situation 1?
practically uncharged here, although the ab
sence of strictly choice wheat hay Is more
marked now than at any time previous this
season. There is plenty of gm>d hay coming.
but for retail purposes we must have gilt-edge
â¢wheat hay and choice . ill! .- red or black tame
oat. These two varieties will probably be in
fair demand throughout the entire year, but j
there Is such an Immense amount of other j
grades that for the present at least there
seems to be a very discouraging future for
same.
"We are continually hearing of large lots of
tally hearing of larse lots of
hay that are being used In private store
houses and in many warehouse buildings where i
the owners are not considering for a moment :
marketing their hay under present prices. It j
(<oe., seen at present from the number of new- .
barns erected that we will have a large sur
plus of hay at the end of the present season un
)r-ss. as we have expressed slves before,
eomo unexpected demand springs up."

EASTERN MARKETS.
New York Stock Market.
XCT' YORK, Sept. 20.â This was a day of
violent fluctuations and great speculative ex
citement upon the Stock Exchange. The move
ment of prices . .... bo feverish and uncertain
that the disposition among professional opera
tors was generally to close up accounts with
tho day. As a consequence net changes are
astonishingly email considering the wide vi
l.ratiun during the day. in only a few instances
do they exceed fractions, and though the ma
jority of Kti.cka are lower there is a fair sprink
ling of gains. There was a time in the morn
ing when a long 111 â¢ of specialties had advanced
between 1% and 3 points and during the after
noon they' Cell very generally to as much be
low last night's level. A range of between
S and S points was traversed during the day
by the lowing Indus-trial Block*:
Continental â¢ Tobacco, â  Smelling preferred,
Colorado Fuel. Consolidated (Jan. Federal Steel,
Manhattan, People's Gun, Tobacco, Metropoli
tan Strtet Railway and Tennessee Coal. Ihe
railroad stocks did not move nearly so widely
aH a rule, but an extreme range of between
Ivs and 4>* wtis traversed by St. Paul, Rock
Inland. Burlington, Northwestern, Great west
ern "A." Chicago and Eastern Illinois, St.
Paul ..... Duluth, Great Northern preferred,
leading first preferred and Lackawanna. ThÂ»
index of the market all day was Brooklyn
Transit, the dealings in which were on an
enormous scale. With a total capitalization of
430.000 shares, to-day's dealings In this stock
footed up 285,175 shares. it advanced 2% after
the opening, fell VA to a new low level at 704.
and then retraced its course, rising 8 points
to 83Vs. and closing at the high level of the
morning. The whole market followed in its
wake In a general way, though Its erratic
fluctuations were impossible to follow at all
times. The market was a gigantic speculative
contest throughout. The bears broke down the
(rains which had been built up in the morning
with apparently little effort and dislodged some
very heavy offerings on the decline from hold
ers who had vainly hoped that the fall in
prices bad come to an end. There was large
selling through commission houses and tha
flood of industrials poured upon the market
â¢was said to be due to the calling of some large
loans in which these stocks figured as collater
als and had to be sold to liquidate. United
States . Milling, which sold yesterday at 56,
Bold to-day at 24, after first selling at 2.'.. an
extreme decline of 32 points. The preferred
Etock, after selling yesterday at 75, sold to-day
at 80, The closing prices for these stocks were
for the common 20tf}25 and for the preferred
40050. There was no Important development
to-day 'in the ' money situation. The rise In
New York exchange at Chicago and the ad
vance'in the call loans at- some other Eastern
cities' indicates that the Western demand for
money has been shifted some from New York
to the other Eastern cities. Considerable sums
of Chicago money are reported to have been
loaned in New York during the week. The
outgo, however, still continues both to the in
terior and to the sub-treasury. Foreign ex
change was somewhat easy, more notably bo
on Paris and Berlin than on London. At this
time last year when New York's surplus re
nerve had fallen below {5, GOO gold began
promptly to come In from Europe. Previous
to September last year we had already im
ported over $100,000,000 of gold on balance.
â while thus far this year the excess of ex
ports of gold has been nearly $3,000,000. Al
though the merchandise exports for eight
months of this year Is nearly $75,000,000 less
than last year the unliquidated trade balance
in our favor thus ' far this year is therefore
jo ; , 000,000 greater than for the same period last
year. Sterling exchange Is still IV4 cents In
the pound above the level at which gold Im
ports began last year.
Bonds weakened In sympathy with stocks,
but the movement was not wide. Total sales
par value, $1. 512.000.
United States bonds were unchanged In bid
quotations.

CHICAGO, Sept. 20.â Wheat opened with a
continuation of the firmness which has for two
days puzzled the trade. In spite of '.he enor
mous liquidation and heavy receipts the mar
ket stubbornly resisted professional selling.
Liverpool reflected the advance here yesterday,
being quoted %a higher. December opened a
shade higher at 70H@70%C and advanced to
70% c, and slowly eased off to 70 : -_.-. Half an
ho;ir from the close local shorts attempted to
cover. Offerings were found extremely scarce
&nd December was bid up through calls to
71-. The close was at 71%Â©71% c. Trade In
September was Email, but it closed at the
71% c. â  -. - -
Corn was erratic owing to the squeeze In the
September option. Sales for that month were
made .it the opening at 34% c. but it advanced
immediately to Bf>c. Profit-taking and a let up
of the pressure on the shorts caused a steady
decline to IV Â«c. Just before the close it was
bid up again to 34Â»ic, or %c under yesterdays
Close. Trsuie in December was of the ordinary
character, closing unchanged.
Oats ruled firm under a scattered liquidation.

Boston Wool Market.
BOSTON, Sept. 20.â The American Wool and
â¢"ott.in Reporter will say to-morrow:
' Another large week's business has been
transacted in the wool market, the sales for
the week aggregating over 9,000,000 pounds.
The market has. In fact, been somewhat ex
cited at times.
T*io weeks aeo some of the sales effected
were reported to have been made slightly
under the edge of the market, but the trans
actions of the past week certainly have been
in most cases at full quotations. Strength
ened by the opening at the London sales,
where prices were quoted 10Â®12% per cent
higher than Â»t the close of the previous sales,
the feelins In the local market Is very firm
and the trend of values is unmistakably up
ward. There is nn especially good demand for
fin.- staple WfÂ«.ls. MaÂ»y of the trade believe
that this kind of stock is bended toward 65c,
and there are not wanting those who are pre
dicting even 70c for this .-lass of stock.
The sales of the week In Boston amount to
0,117.000 pounds domestic and 395,000 pounds
foreign, making a total of 9.512,000, against a
total of g.oatf.OOO for the previous week and a
totaJ of i.584.000 for the corresponding week
last year. Sales since January 1. 1599, amount
to 209,R46,000 pounds, against 83,764,010 pounds
last year at this time.
London Wool Sales.
LONDON. Sept. 20.â offerings at the
wool auction sales to-day numbered 15,067 bales.
including a good selection of Queensland new
crop. The latter was in better condition than
the IS9B crop and the home trade and the Con
tinent were eager bidders for this grade.
Scoured merinos were well represented and sold
principally to Yorkshire at hardening rates.
The Continent operated reservedly and Is evi
dently waiting for the opening of the Aus
tralian sales next week. Swan River sold read-
II: to the home trade. Lambs were in excep
tionally strong demand and merinos sold at 15
per '?:it advance. Crossbreds were in sternly
request at prices ranging from 10 to 15 per sent
higher, Yorkshire taking the bulk. Fine
creasy croasbreds were quickly disposed of.
Medium low erossbreds. were largely repre
sented and brought out keen competition, with
the home trade the best buyer at decidedly
harder rates. A good selection of washed
cross stripes was taken by the home trade at
an advance of 10 per cent.

I Funston Avenges His Wounded Horse
Colonel Funston sat on his horse,
watching his . Kansas boys lire at the
enemy at Caloocan, when an orderly came
up with the commanding general's com
pliments and an order to stop firing.
"Cease tiring!" shouted the. colonel.
Only a few of the nearest, men heard
him and the firing kept on.
"Cease firing" ordered the colonel
again, and this time the bugle gave forth :
the peal and the firing, after scattering , â 
stopped altogether. Just then a ball from ;
the insurgents drilled the neck of the
colonel's pony. Quick as a flash Funston
whirled around, fire in his eyes.
"Commence firing!" he shouted at the
top of his voice. Give 'em at nine
hundred yards!" '
It took three or four rounds of ammuni
tion all along the line to avenge that
horse, though the colonel still rides it.â

Oakland Olrice San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Sept. 20.
Somewhere In Europe In the breast of
Senator Fred Stratton is securely locked
the key to the political situation in Ala
meda County. It is the general opinion
that Senator Stratton does not wish to
succeed himself. He has more than in
timated that such is his intention, butâ
When the Senator left Oakland a few
months ago his primary law had not
been tested, and consequently when he
talked of rearing from public life he
was not aware of the boom that its suc
cess has since given to its author. The
knowledge of whether he will or will
not retire would be a source of great sat
isfaction at this time, when lines are
already being laid for the general cam
paign next year.
Assemblyman Bliss is already a candi
date for Senatorial honors. The same
supporters who put him in the Assembly
declare their ability to place him in the
Senate. Mr. Bliss is ambitious, but not
aggressive. Personally he would prefer
to succeed himself as Assemblyman, but
circumstances may force him into the
Senatorial race.
Just now Mr. Bliss is a very interesting
political factor. For several weeks it
has been generously whispered that the
Assemblyman had bet bought by the
followers of Dan Burns; and that the
particular bait is the contract Mr. Bliss
now holds for plying all the dairy
products to the Pullman Company. Add
ed to this, a local paper a few days ago
published something complimentary to
Bliss, and concluded with an apologetic
statement that perhaps the !a*t Senato
rial fight at Sacramento had been fought
on very narrow lines, and that now the
legislators have had time to think they
might be inclined toward more liberality.
This was construed as inferring that Mr.
Bliss, who was a pronounced Grant man
and a pronounced anti-Burns man, might
have changed his mind.
Mr. Bliss has not changed his mind and
will never vote for Colonel Burns for
United States Senator.
"That story of ing bought by the
privilege of supplying butter and cream
to the Pullman Company," said Mr.
Bliss, "is one of the funniest I have
heard for a long time. It is true I have
that contract, and it is just as true that
I have had it all the years I have been
in business and an age before I war ever
thought of in politics. It is a wonder that
it is not reported that the contract has
been taken.Â«*away from me, for my re
fusal to vote for Colonel Burns. But I
do not anticipate any such action. When
I was first elected the newspapers in siz
ing up the Senatorial situation placed
me either with the Burn* men or in the
doubtful list, and one of them published
a story that I was to be reached through
my brother-in-law who was represented
to be a well paid employe of the Southern
Pacific. It happens that I have no
brother-in-law, nor any other relative,
however remote, employed by the rail
road company. In Oakland a man can
hear anything by talking to himself and
1 have learned that this is the met! by
which many so-called 'political rumors'
emanating from "a source of undoubted
authority' have their birth.
"Before Mr. Grant went north I visited
him in San Diego. We discussed the Sen
atorial situation. I asked him If in the
event of an extra session he would again
be a candidate. He said that he would
n<jver be a candidate again, if it meant
getting into another fight such as was
waged at Sacramento this spring. I
understood from this conversation that it
in unlikely he will again seek Senatorial
"Strange as it may seem, with all the
reported political workings that have been
going on in regard to an extra session and
the calling of a caucus, I have never been
asked to Elgn a call for a caucus since the
Legislature adjourned, and neither have I
been asked to vote for any particular
candidate. My constituents do not want
Colonel Burns, and that ends it. 1 am
ulways ready to go into a caucus if by
so doing the Republicans can agree upon
a representative man, but I should never
be bound by any caucus as regards my
vote on United States Senator. I cer
tainly would not agree to enter a caucus
liA^d on the principle of dropping the
weakest candidate each time and binding
everybody to vote for the- man having the
most votes at the finish.
â â¢I have talked with Senator Stratton on
the question of the State Senatorship and
he gave me very plainly to understand
that he would not be a candidate to suc
ceed himself. This Impression seems to
be very general, and I find that he gave
Jt to many of his friends. If I were asked
what I would like to do I would prefer to
succeed myself as Assemblyman, but
these matters have to be adjusted, like
everything else, and if I find that it is
expedient to attempt to succeed Mr. Strat
ton I shall certainly make the attempt.
I do not feel that anything I did at Sac
ramento this spring needs an apology,
and I may say without egotism that since
my turn I have been thoroughly con
vinced that my course was in harmony
with the wishes of the people who Bent
rr.e there."
Assemblyman Joe Kelly, when asked re
cently if he had been requested to sign a
rail "for a Republican caucus, made the
very honest reply: "No. I have never
cu-en such a paper. 7 understand, though,
that one is being circulated, but I guess
ihey know where I stand, anyhow, and
they don't feel it necessary to run after
me." Mr. Kelly, however, omitted to
explain who was represented by "they."
Howard "Wright moved his residence
from East Oakland as soon after the ad-
Ir.urnment of the Legislature as was con
venient, and it Is understood he Is now
living somewhere on BernaJ Heights. He

SAYS NEGROES ARE
PREPARING FOR RACE WAR
OAKLAND. Sept. 20.â Rev. J. L, Allen,
pastor of the Beth Eden Baptist Church,
which is an organization of colored peo
ple, has expressed some radical ideas re
! garding the increasing race troubles in
I the Southern States. For many years he
lived in the South. He says:
This last evilâ that of lynching â must be fol
lowed by anotherâ a race war, which, in my
mind, seems Inevitable.
Of course the problems of the South between
the whites and blacks could be settled without
war: but this involves the taking of an entirely
different standâ one toward the other â by both
the whites and blacks. It must be admitted
that a great many negroes are Ignorant, but I
believe that those who do understand the real
' situation have been responsible for misleading
the others. The negroes should let politics j
: the whites should let the negroes alone
and permit them to vote as they please. I say
there is no real need of it. if some precautions
were taken, but 1 am tearful that a war must
be Neither the white nor ths black understimd
each other. They will fight as long as they
i rannnt uniWptand each other.
I look for this war any time; should not be
i surprise! to find it coming on within the next
few weeks In the nature of uprisings. In the
I long run there is only one way for such a race
', war to end, but the public, in my belief, under-
I estimates the strength of the negroes. Very
j many of the blacks in the South are men of
lerable means, and these, so I am md
, have b<^n turning their property hold-
Ingt Int c in and laying up stores of arms and
] ammunition by way of preparation for a rare
I conflict. I am Inclined to think that God will
i be on the r.^trro Fide, and that the result of
i such a conflict would be for good. It is clear
! to my mind that the races nrver can be sepa
! rated. They cannot live one without the other.
â  No two races can live separately in this coun
try under its system of government.
How the war will change the social status of
the negro I do not care to predict.

SHOCK OF THE
TRIAL MAY RILL
JOHN NICHOLL
So Declares Expert
Dr. Woolsey.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, Sept. 20.
The features to-day at the trial of the
$50,000 breach of promise suit of Jane
Hodge against the aged capitalist John
Nicholl, who is familiarly known as the
"Duke of Richmond," was the expert
testimony given by Dr. E. S. Woolsey. J.
S. Eastman and Frank L. Adams; some
warm cross-firing between the attorneys
and the much longed for story of Mazie
Nicholl, whom the aged plaintiff regards
as the prime cause and instigator of the
breach of promise.
When the trial was resumed this fore
noon the courtroom was crowded with
spectators and Attorney Foote's cross-ex
amination of the aged defendant, Mr.
Nicholl, was continued. He declared that
he had never told his daughters of his
alleged engagement to Miss Hodge, but
that the latter had broken this news to
them. Regarding the spicy letter received
by Miss Hodge over his signature defend
ant frankly admitted he had dictated it*
contents.
Attorney Foote was anxious to learn
what church Nlcholl attended and the
First Presbyterian proved to be the one.
Mr. Foote openly admitted he was not
up on churches and Mr. Nicholl face
tiously remarked that "it is time you
were."
"You are known Â«hy the name of 'Duke
of Richmond' sometimes?" queried At
torney Foote.
"Yes, that and many other names," re"
sponded the witness, who at one time
owned Point Richmond, now belonging to
the Valley Railroad, "and BOmetfmes my
daughters call me 'Duke' at home, just
joking." Thereafter matters pertaining
to Mr. Nicholl'B health during last No
vember were gone into and it appeared
that during that month witness had not
been well.
Dr. E. S. Woolsey was called this after
noon to give expert testimony as to the
aged capitalist's condition. He graphic
ally described his method of examination
of the defendant, related the fact that
Nicholl had nearly fainted at the time
and that in his opinion, briefly. Nicholl
was enfeebled. The doctor declared that
any shock would be likely to kill the de
fendant. "In fact." he continued, "it is
my opinion that the shock of this trial
will kill him." To this statement Mr.
Foote vigorously objected. Dr. Woolsey
also declared that matrimony in Nicholl 3
case might prove immediately fatal.
When Dr. Woolsey had been disposed of
he took a seat beside defendant's counsel
and began coaching Attorneys McKee and
Mhoon in their examination of Dr. J. S.
Eastman who was next called. Attorney
Foote objected to this, declared it was un
fair and referred to Dr. Woolsey as "the
main guy" of the defense's experts.
Judge Ogden, however, ruled that the
doctor's action would not beobjectionablo.
Dr. Eastman, as well as Dr. Frank L.
Vdams who followed on the stand, both
testified that they had examined de
fendant's physical condition; but while
each summed up his various ailments
about the same, neither would vouch as
to any absolute prool of feebleness.
The" star witness of the defense. Miss
Mazie Nicholl, was now called, and all
eyes were turned upon her. She. was
gowned In black, with white front and
pretty blue collar. Around her neck also
loosely hung a black boa. Her hat was
forgeously decorated with green feathers.
ler hair, Sprinkled with gray, gave her
a matronly appearance. Yet she spoke
quite dramatically, her big black eyes
snapping at times when objections and
interruptions were made while she gave
her Btory, which seemed exceedingly well
memorized. Once while her father's
counsel made a slip by referring to her
as "Now. Miss Hodge," Mazie s color
rose to her cheeks.
"No affection further than that of an
uncle for his neice existed between Jane
and my father," she replied in answer
to a question. Asked what she knew of
the alleged engagement, etc., she said in
part:
"On November 11, 1 98. I went to Jane's
home at Mrs. Boyd'v and was surprised
over her peculiar m finer. 1 asked what
was the matter, an< she replied: 'Why,
Mazie, don't you knoÂ»v? Why, your papa
has proposed to me.' Thin slu- asked me
to speak out. I did not know what tv
say. "Why Mazie,' she continued, 'your
fapa has been after me for two years.'
told h'.-r she ought to know papa was
old and did and said 80 many foolish and
annoying things. Jan.- said, '1 told him
1 did not love him, but that 1 would be
affectionate.' Finally she promised she
would drop the matter and go riding with
him no more.
"I told her we could never get along to
gether and that she could never be the
same to us again. I told her some pro
vision would have to be made for us girls
Eiessle and me â about the property, as,
for instance, that she should get only a
child's share. Then she said for me to go
home, talk it over with Hessie and what
ever we decided she would abide by.
Those were her last words, 'I'll abide by
your decision.'
"On December 8 I saw her again and
we went driving to have a final talk. I
tol.l Jane 1 had not n-uch to tell her, and
she complained that 1> had told Mrs. Boyd
about the engagement; that Mrs. Boyd
had told a neighbor a : nd now it was pub
lic talk all over. I thought I had a right
to tell of It to the only living relative of
my dear mother. I replied that I told
auntie because I thought slip might help
us decide the matterâ possibly in Jane's
favor. Hessie and I told Jane that papa
may get a wife, but we could never get
another mother. Jane complained, too*
that the decision had been long coming
and said 1 had never treated her ns a
cousin. Finally I told her it was all off
she could never come into our home, and
she suggested T ask father to write his
refusal to marry her over his signature.
'No,' I said; 'it cannot beâ lt cannot be.'
"Auntie Boyd, when she heard of it,
said it was a shame, disgrace, the idea of
such a woman marrying an old man; that
Jane wouldn't live with him two weeks
and that she had roped him in."
On cross-examination by Attorney Nus
batimer Miss Mazie Nicholl admitted that
she had taken notes of all the conversa
tions she had testified to, a fact that ac
counted for her remarkable memory.
The trial will be resumed to-morrow
morning.
"FLEEING FROM POMPEII."
Marble Group Presented to Art Asso
ciation by George Crocker.
Mr. and Mrs. George Crocker have pre-
Bented to the San Francisco Art Associa
tion a mapniflcent marble group entitled
"Fleeing from Pompeii." The subject
treated is an incident of the overwhelm
ing of Pompeii by the eruption of Vesu
vius. It represents the flight of a man
and woman through the showers of ashes,
smoke and lava that destroyed the ancient
city. The woman carries an infant in one
arm. and all three figures are gracefully
modeled.
The group is about eight feet high and
rests on a circular pedestal three feet in
height on which is carved several figures
typical of the life of that period. The
statuary is in white marble and is the
work of the famous sculptor Bonzoni, who
flourished some twenty years ago. The
original cost was $20,000. It is now in Mr.
Crocker's parlor, but will be transferred
to the art association in a day or two.

TO LIFT THE DEBT OF
NEW YOUTHS' DIRECTORY
GENERAL COMMITTEE EFFECTS
PERMANENT ORGANIZATION.
Will Endeavor to Raise Any Deficit
Which May Remain After
Applying Proceeds of the
Grand Bazaar.
The general committee having In charge
the approaching fair and bazaar in aid
of the new Youths' Directory at the sug
gestion of Chairman Kelly decided at a
meeting last night to perpetuate its or
ganization until the last cent of the $35,
--000 debt which confronts the institution
is paid. While it is confidently expected
that a large sum will be realized by the
fair, which will commence on September
2S at Armory Hall, Market street, near
Tenth, still it is presumed that there will
remain a deficit, and to overcome this the
committee will continue its labors.
Chairman Costello of the. committee on
programme reported that interesting fea
tures will be presented every evening dur
ing the fair, and tiie ladles of the dif
ferent booths will have "nights at home,"
at which there will be vocal and instru
mental selections.
The ladies drew lots for choice of posi
tions for the booths with the following
result: No. 1, Saint Rose's; 2, candy
booth; 3, St. Dominick's; 4. charity; 5,
Mission Dolores; 6, St. Anthony's; 7, SL
Joseph's Union; 8, St. Patrick's; 9, St.
Charles; 10, League of the Cross; 11, hos
pital; 12, St. Mary's; 13, Sacred Heart;
14, St. Anne's.
The executive committee has the dcc
i oration in hand and will be assisted by
j the ladies in charge. They will all meet
: at the Armory next Monday morning to
arrange details.
The chairman appointed George Gal
lagher, W. A. Derham and H. J. Fisher
| as a printing committee, and Mr. Fisher
will also act as a press committee. J. B.
! Mclntyre, G. B. Gallagher, 11. J. Maher
'â¢ and Frank Conklin will confer with the
I various organizations of the city for spe-
I cial nights.
David J. Costello was appointed poet
: laureate of the Youths' Directory and
i will compose a poem to be read at the
! opening of the fair.
Two scholarships for a boy and a girl
I have been offered by two of the leading
business colleges and will be contested
for by popular vote. J. H. Rossiter has
donated a greyhound to be raffled for. A
vote of thanks was tendered to the gen-
erous givers.
There will bo two musieales given in
aid of the directoryâ one to-night at the
residence of Mrs. J. P. Carroll, 631 Guer
rero street, and the other next Monday
night by Mrs. Mulvehill at 3534 Twenty
second street, near Castro.
SOL CAHEN RETURNS.
Past Department Commander of the
G. A. R. Will Tell Garfield
Post of His Visit East.
Past Department Commander Sol Cahen
of the Grand Army of the Republic re
turned yesterday from Philadelphia,
where he was one of the representatives
from the department of California and
Nevada at the National Encampment of
the G. A. R. On his way home he had
as companion Pension Commissioner H.
Clay Evans, who is on his way to this
city. Mr. Evans stopped at Salt Lake for
a "short stay. During his absence of a
month Mr. Cahen remained a week in
Philadelphia in attendance on the en
campment, and then went to Washing
ton, D. C. where he paid a visit to Presi
dent McKinlry. Next Tuesday night he
will attend a meeting of Garfield Post
and will tell of his visit in Washington
and to places that were made historic
by the War of the Rebellion.

Richmond in for Improvements.
Progressive Richmond, through its im- \
provement club, will demand its share of !
the tax levy. In several sections there are
choked sewers and drifting sands which
will be catalogued among the nuisances
of the district. At a meeting of the Point
Loboa Improvement Club on Tuesday
President George B. Fletcher stated for
the Information of the executive commit
tee that the time has arrived when certain
Improvements had become a necessity.
Among subjects of complaint was the bad
condition of a blind sewer on Thirty-first
avenue, which had been permitted to re
tain the offal of a cow ranch in the neigh
borhood to the injury of owners of prop
erty, who would otherwise build on their
lots and add to the wealth of the district.
Drifting sands which were permitted by
the owners of vacant lots had become a
nuisance which was Intolerable and an
in justice to those property owners who
had improved their streets and sidewalks.
John J. Cassldy, secretary of the execu
tive committee, with J. M. Wilkins, chair
man of the same body, drew the atten
tion of the club to the want of more lights
through the entire valley. On the recom- ;
mendatlon of Mr. Wilkins the secretary
was instructed to communicate with the
Supervisors and request that body to pave
the city's portion of Fulton street, from
First avenue to Stanyan street, alongside
of Golden Gate Park, the property own
ers haying paved their portion on the
north side.
On motion of Secretary W. P. Johnson
thj 5 chair appointed the following commit
tee on the monthly social which will be>
held in the club rooms on the night of Oc
tober 28: J. T. Williams (chairman), pres
ident; George R. Fletcher, v. W. Wench
ell, Ed GJnley, A. Hlmenover, W. P. John
son and P. M. McGushin. The admission
will be by tickets at 25 cents, and a dance
will follow the literary exercises.
Eureka Society in Hot Water.
There is another rumpus in the Eureka
Society for the Protection of Children.
Ex-Secretary Wadham resigned as a di
rector yesterday and he was followed by
D. S. O'Brien nixl J. C. Irvine. They,:
with W. H. Treighler. propose to form
another society to he known as the San :
Francisco Society for the Protection of
Children. The statement has been made
that the trouble was caused by the fact
that "VVadham ran the Eureka society as
a sort of divorce bureau in the interests
of his legal friend O'Brien. For every
charge there Is a counter-charge. The :
directors of the Eureka body at once filled |
the vacancies by electing- L. A. Albora.
O. M. Ratto and S. T. Dodson. It still
holds the Eureka Boys' Home, where
there are about three dozen children.
There is some apprehension that Wad
ham will make trouble with regard to
the custody of some of these children
over whom he was appointed guardian
during the time he was secretary of the
Eureka society. He says li^ will retain
the guardianship over a number.
Driven From Home.
The officers of the Society for the Pre
vention of Cruelty to Children are
i puzzling over the case of a little waif
which fell into their hands yesterday.
The daughters of Mrs. Mary Garbarino
of 1117 Broadway found a little girl
wandering on Pacific street, near Mason,
whose face was badly cut. She said that
the wounds were Inflicted by her father,
who struck her when she asked him fur
bread. The child gave her name as Anna
ii( Qrody, and said that she was 8 years
I of age, and that her folks lived in Salmon
alley, off Pacific street. Mrs. Garbarino
kindly cared for the waif until yesterday,
when' Officer Shannon inrule an unsatls
i factory investigation. He failed to find
! any one of the name given in Salmon
alley, and no one there knew the child.
! She" was placed with the Ladies' Pro
! tection and Relief Society.
Chinese Gamblers Arrested.
The San Francisco Chinese Merchant.**'
Club at 127 Waverly place was raided last
evening by Sergeant Duke and posse and
thirty-seven prisoners taken. The entire
fan-tan outlit was captured and the raid
was one of the most successful for some
time. The capture was effected by Offi
cer John Conlan, who masqueraded as a

gambling room. His mnke-up was com
plete and the wily heathens were taken
by surprise. The prisoners were locked
up at the California street police sta
tion.

Seventeen Inmates of the Youths' Dl-
I rectory yesterday morning scaled the
i fence "surrounding that institution and
i made their escape. They were encouraged
i to make the â¢'break" by four boys who
I are now in the City Prison. The names
i of the latter are Alfred and John Fay,
aged eight and nine years respectively.

CROSSED WIRES START A FIRE.
An Early Morning Blaze on Market
Street, Near Powell.
A fire which caused much damage to
the basements of the business-houses on
the first part of the ten-hundred block
of Market street occurred about 2 o'clock
this morning. It is supposed to have been
i aused by the short circuiting of wires
under the tailor-shop of A. Jacobs at 1010
Market street. Its discovery was due
to the sudden extinguishing "of the elec
tric lights in the saloon of Kelly & Bren
nan. at 1016 Market, which caused one
of the proprietors, Harry Brennan, to
make an investigation, resulting in the
location of the blaze.
An alarm was rung in from box 47, and
when tlie firo department arrived clouds
of smoke were Issuing from many of the
stores, Much damage was caused by
smoke and water, and the department
worked nearly one hour before the lire
was entirely < xtinguished.

Wedekind, R. H. Noble and J. W. Ed
monds, the committee on social hour, took
charge and entertained those present with
a good programme of sours, instrumental
music, gramaphone selections and an ad
dress on the work of the order by Thomas
Johnstone, the grand reporter, it was
one of the most pleasant smokers that
this lodge has ever tdven.
A Supposed Incendiary Fire.
\n alarm was turned in yesterday after
noon at 4 o'clock for a fire on Cotter |
street, opposite the Jewish Orphanage j
Asylum on the Mission road. The damage j
amounted tv about $23. The fire was sup- !
posed to be the work of an incendiary.
The property damaged belonged to a man
named Anderson, who was absent at the
time, and shortly before the tire was dis
covered two ladies, Mrs. Hallock, resid
ing on Francis street, and Mrs. Kock,
residing at 23 Cotter street, two doors
from where the fire started, saw a man
cuming out from the rear of the building
at 19 Cotter street, where the fire oc
curred. Immediately after he left the
premises smoke was seen to emerge from
the back portion of the building.
The ladies were unable to give an accu
rate description of the man further than
to say that he was a tall, thin fellow,
with a high white collar, and dressed in
a dark suit of clothes. Detectivps Fitz
gerald and Graham are on the case.
Policeman Freel Fined.
Policeman John Freel, whose ambition
is to be a detective, was fined $2f> by the
Police Commissioners last night for being
drunk. Several days ago Fred reported
for duty in an intoxicated condition and,
swelled with his own importance and In
cidentally his "jap." he starti-d to dic
tate to Captain AYittman as to how to run
the department. Wittman sent him home
and the following day he preferred
charges against him. After listening to
the evidence In the case the Commission
ers charitably imposed a fine instead of
dismissing the offender from the depart
ment.

FARC E COMEDY
PRESENTED AT
THE ALCAZAR,
ii Â» WAKE and personally present!"
A might be a good answer to roll
Â£\ call at the Alcazar this week, for
"Too Much Johnson" seems to be
drawing a good half the theater going
public, and to sleep were an impossi
bilityânoise is rampant. In spite of the
title. Billings Is the manâ and what a
man. The fact that one can lie is a fatal
defect and skill argues a long apprentice
ship. If the fellow ever gave himself an
i introspective look, the shock would blind
! himâ he is the very prince of liars, and
because of this, adored of the audience.
Not being required morally to agitate
I the public over farce-comedy, let him
settle the case with his own creditors.
The audience, considering him in the
person of Eugene Ormonde, are his
debtors. He is a quietly triumphant
rascal, never too slow but once, when
he holds the first curtain tableau a shade
too long, and beautifully wooden and
unemotional to the end. Miss Howe, as
the mother-in-law, is the first of the
w.,rnen not overdoing tho bustling splrli
I and seldom too loud. The two yoiing
things, Mr. Denithorne and Miss Henry,
out to capture the conditions of happi
ness, are merely background, and as
such, unimportant.
Miss Foster does her almost nothing
quietly and well. Mr. Webster is a
ferocious Mr. Johnson, but very funny.
He would be equally funny if his voice
were tamed or even crippled. There is
I not a serious moment in the action, and
I constant laughter is inevitable. Next
i week "The Idler" is the bill.
CHARLOTTE THOMPSON.
Midweek Notes.
The Columbia opens its doors on Mon
day evening with Madame Modjeska in
"Marie Antoinette." Clinton Stuart, the
author, claims original treatment of an
old theme.
The Orpheum offers an exceptional
bill to Its patrons this week, and stand-
Ing room only is the result. Nexi
Jennie Yeamans, Frank Cushman, the
minstrel, and Seymour and Dupree are the
additions.
"The Drum Major's Daughter" is in its
last nights at the Grand Opera-house.
On Monday "Rip Van Winkle" will be
sung.
The California Theater, thoroughly re
fitted, will open Sunday, October 1. with
Ben Hendricks in "A Yenuine Yentle
man."
The Tivoli has played to its capacity
with "Lohengrin" and "Othello." The
I popularity of the latter warrants its be-
I ing run another week. It will alternate
I with "Martha."
I Adgie and her lions are still the chief
I attraction at the Chutes. The amateur
â Amazon march is the feature of this
(evening's performance.
Braunhart Perjury Case.
When the perjury proceedings pending
against Sammy Braunhart were taken up
yesterday morning before Judge Graham
"the defendant's attorney. Garret Mc
l Enerney, stated that he had only received
i a transcript of the evidence from the
rourt stenographer the night before am',
for that reason he requested Judge Gra
ham to continue the case. Judge Graham
continued Braunhart's case until 9 o'clock
! this morning, when the arguments will
I be heard.
Smuggled Silks on the Sherman.
Customs searchers found yesterday on
the Government transport Sherman a
i quantity of silk dress goods hidden near
i the powder magazine. The bundles bore
the names of United States officers who
; returned from Manila on the transport.
! The goods were seized and confiscated by
j the Federal authorities, but will be de
i live red to the owners on payment of the
duty owing on the articles, there being
a concession made in the case of sol
diers.

An enthusiastic meeting of the rela
tives and friends of the Calif or nians in
the fourteenth Regular Infantry, who
are expected to arrive home on the City
of Para early next week, was hel<l in the
Ellis-street armory last night for the
purpose of receiving the report of the
committee appointed to confer with the
citizens' committee in the matter of pro
viding a fitting welcome to the brave
Eoldier boys. The fact that the report of
this committee was somewhat in the
nature of a disappointment did not for a
moment dampen the enthusiasm, but
served rather to strengthen the deter
mination of the relatives' association to
carry out their cherished plans for a
grand reception.
President John McGeary called the
meeting to order, and after the miutes
of the previous meeting had been read by
the secretary, Miss Philita Mohun,
Chairman J. H. Burson road the report
of the committee, the substance of which
was that while the citizens' committee
was willing and anxious to do every
thing in its power to give the boys a wel
come, there were serious obstacles which
must tirst be overcome. The first ob
stacle was contained in a letter from
General Shafter stating that the Four
teenth would lie landed at Angel Island,
where they would be paid off and brought
to this city 200 or 800 at a time.
The second was the announced declara
tion of the Harbor Commission that the
nave of the ferry building would not he
available for future banquets. The citi
zens' committee, however, promised that
every effort would be made to Induce
General Shafter to permit the landing of
the soldiers in San Francisco in a body,
to Induce the Harbor Commission to
reconsider its decision, and further, to
furnish a tug and a band to meet the
transport as she enterd the harbor.
It was decided to engage a steamer on
which tho relatives could also go out to
mÂ»Â»e.t the City of Para, and I^s tickets
were 6poken for on the spot.
During the evening the association gave
a warm testimonial of lta appreciation
of the friendship existing between the
North Dakota volun teens, several hun
9red of whom wore present by invitation,
Rnd the California boys in the Fourteenth
Infantry, by adopting the following reso
lution.-?, which were read by J. R. Baird:
Whereas, We, the friends and rela
tives of the volunteers serving in the
Fourteenth Regular Infantry, have as
sembled In duly organized meeting,
and
Whereas, We recognise the many
acts of kindness and of friendship
shown by tho officers and men of the
North Dakota volunteers to the vol
unteers of the Fourteenth Infantry
djjring the Philippine campaign, and,
Whereas, We feel that it is our duty,
in the absence of our boys, to thank
the officers and men of the North Da
kota volunteers; therefore, be it
Resolved, That the North Dakota
volunteers have our heartfelt thanks
and our best wishes that thoy may at
tain the reward of true friends and
brave patriots; and be it further
Resolved, That these resolutions be
spread upon the minutes of this as
sociation and that copies be forwarded
to the North Dakota volunteers and to
the press.
Mr. Baird had hardly resumed his seat
n-hen the North Dakotans rose in a body
tnd cheered the relatives' association
antil the building shook. The latter re
ipomled with a will and then a committee
lonsistlnK of Mrs. Kennedy, Mrs. Walker
Hid Mrs Baird was appointed to go out
10 the Presidio to-day and present copies
If the resolutions to the North Dakota
â egiment. The association then adjourned

Mr Grant is a merchant of character.

ment of large and progressive cities.

willingness to surrender the time which

The Democratic convention will meet
again next Tuesday evening. The con
test among aspirants for the office of
District Attorney is becoming quite ani
mated. The Iroquois brave* have re
solved that every man who failed to sup
port Bryan for President in 1896 shall be
excluded from the list of the acceptable.
This resolution is regarded as a declara
tion against Charles Wesley Reed.
R. Porter Ashe is gaining strength
among the delegates, and his nomina
tion for District Attorney would be no
surprise. Many delegates believe that he
would win out by reason of his personal
popularity when another candidate might
lose.
The Democratic Municipal Convention,
committee on platform and resolutions
will meet to-night at 8 o'clock at the
headquarters of the Democratic County
Committee.
The Forty-first delegation to the Re
publican convention held a meeting yes

PART BASALT BLOCKS,
THE REST BITUMINIZED
THE PECULIAR CONDITIONS ON
MONTGOMERY STREET.
T. J. Clunie Declines to Act With
Other Property-Owners and the
Result Is a Disfigured.
Pavement.
Considerable curiosity was aroused yes- !
terday afternoon regarding the paving, of ;
the block on Montgomery street, between
Pine and California. It was noticed that
the block was being bltuminized, the con
crete foundation having already been laid,
with the exception of fifty-nine feet in
front of the property belonging to T. J.
| Clunie. On this portion the workmen
! were busy putting .<ack the old basalt
I blocks which formerly constituted the
; pavement.
The explanation of the matter lies in
the differences tuat exist between Clunie
and the City Street â¢ Improvement Com
pany, which was recently authorized by
resolution of the Board of Supervisors to
proceed with the work. The city is to
stand $490 of the expense, and the prop
j erty owners the balance. According to J. !
W. McDonald, the president of the pay-
I ing company, ail the property owners
| agreed to have the work done under the
| conditions placed by the Board of Super
: visors.
"1 had the street torn up," said Mc-
Donald, "ready to be paved, and my rep
resentative went to see Clunie's manager,
j J. H. Todd, in regard to the proposition.
He was told what the cost would be, and
I he, replied that he could have the work
: done for $45, though Todd did not offer 113
I that amount. My representative informed
.him that it was impossible to do it for
$45, as that would bo at the rate of 6
> conts a foot, which would not pay for the
j concrete, i As ho refused to treat with us
! there was only one thing to do, and that
was to put the basalt blocks back in
place."
Manager Todd when seen in regard to
j the affair said: "We have no desire to
' stand in the way of public Improvements
whatever. McDonald Is working under
an old agreement signed by all the prop
i erty owners except the Stevenson estate,
from whom General Clunle bought this
! property. We have never signed the pe
j tition, and do not feel bound by it. Me
' Donald's man did not come to see us
! until the street was torn up. I had al
ready practically signed a contract with
the Pacific Paving Company for the same ;
; kind of pavement now in front of the
Phelan Duilding, consisting of wooden
j blocks covered with bitumen, which I
consider superior to the other pavement.
When McDonald set his figure it was so
much higher than that of my choice, of
pavement that I refused to entertain it.
In a moment of pique, I suppose, he had
! the blocks put back. We will shortly
put down the pavement which we were
â¢originally In favor of. and that will end i
the matter,"

Pacilic Company comprises some 300,000
shares of the capital stock and is Jointly
owned by George Crocker, \V. 11. Crocker,
the three children of the late Colonel Fred
Ciuoker ana Mis. Hattie Alexander of
New York. These shares at the present
prices would be worth between Sli'.Ooo.oOO
and $11,U(Ai,OuO. This is considerably less
than the reported price of. the t-ale. More
over, Huntingdon, who, It is almost a cer
tainty, Is the man for whom Speyer is
acting, Is not the one to pay more
than its value for anything he buys.
If he nurses the exact mark at all It la
pretty sure to I"; on the under rather than
on the over side of the line.
When seen yesterday George Crocker
refused absolutely to give any information
either one way or the- other. To all ques
tion* put to him his one answer was: "If
there has been any such deal as you in
qulre about, Mr. Spe> or, taking your ques- |
tions for my authority, is the man who
made the purchase. Therefore it Is to
him you must go for the information you
peek. There have been reporters up here j
all day, and each one of them has re
ceived the fame answer, and that la the
only one they will get from me."
Mr. Crocker was then asked to deny
the story, which be refused to do, and all !
questions pertaJning to his future position
:: ; relation to the company, of which he j
is now the second vice president, he abso
lutely declined to discuss, saying that his
answers might be construed into a reply
to the first and- all important one.
However, his demeanor was such that
a man after talking with him a few mo
ments could not help leaving witli his tirst !
suspicions of a deal having been strength
ened almost to a conviction.
Every other member of the family
as well as every director and of
ficer of the company acted in
the same way. They all re
fused to admit any knowlf-dge of such a
sale being in progress, but thoir denials
were practical admission of tho truth of
the report, so weak and confused were
they.
There is one thing upon which there
can hardly be any doubt. If the sale
does go through it will be found that
Huntlngton is the man for whom Speyor
Is acting:. Hardly any one <-lse would
think of investiiii; so heavily in a concern
in which he would not have the con
trolling influence nr taking such an Im
mense block of stock, which is not paying
anything very remarkable In the way of
dividends, particularly when bo many bet
ter Investments can be found by one hav
ing so much capita! lying idle.
Huntington's purchnsr- of the Crocker
interest means that Huntington, and
Huntlngton alone, will be the one power
in the company. True the Stanford inter
est is still there, but it will be nearly
secondary so far as any Influence It may
exert on the policy of the road is con
cerned. The man who, In all probability, \
will be selected to represent the master
mind on this coast will bo H. E. Hunt
ington, who, notwithstanding reports to j
the contrary, is on excellent terms with
his uncle and has the old gentleman's
confidence, as far as that astute financier
extends it to any one.

AN ATTEMPTED SUICIDE
FOLLOWS LOVE QUARREL
|-|- IZZIE MURPHY, a good looking servant girl, tried to end her life with
; carbolic acid yesterday. She had a quarrel with Frank Onettl, her
' I lover, and when he refused to make It up she placed a two-ounce vial
' -Iâ i of the deadly drug to her lips and would have swallowed It all had not
' Onettl knocked the bottle out of her hand.
> Lizzie lives with her cousin, Martin Maker, who keeps the lodging house
, at 1017 Broadway. Onettl works in the Gibraltar warehouse. The couple
5 have been lovers for nearly two years and were to have been married next
' month. Miss Murphy, however, took a fancy to another young man and
? went out with him a couple of times, much to the disgust of Onettl. After a
' heated argument one day he persuaded Lizzie to go to his brother Joe's place
5 on Sutter Creek. Joe is a married man and is doing well at placer mining.
p She remained there for some time and only came back to 1017 Broadway last
; Saturday.
5 The couple met last Tuesday nlpht and quarreled. Lizzie brooded over
â¢ it and early yosterday morning purchased the carbolic acid. At noon she
! met Frank as he was returning to hia home from the warehouse, for his
. lunch, and asked him to lot bygones bo bygones. Onetti said he did not
want to sco anything more of her. It was then she swallowed the carbolic
â¢ acid.
Onetti picked her up from the sidewalk where she was writhing in
! agony and carried her to 1017 Broadway, where Bhe was given an emetic.
, The Harbor Hospital was then rung up and In a few minutes sho was in the
operating room in the institution. Drs. Morrison and Folkers worked over
I her for half an hour and then pronounced her out of danger. Miss Murphy
le badly burned with the acid about the mouth and face and will be able to
' swallow nothing but liquids for some time to come.

GIGANTIC RAILWAY TRUST.
Significance of Rockefeller's
Entry Into New York. Cen
tral Directorate.
NEW YORK, Sept. 20.â The Journal
says: "A billion dollar railroad combine
is foreshadowed by the entry of "William
Rockefeller into the directory of the New
York Central.
"Tho union of Rockefeller and Vandcr
bilt transportation interests throughout
the country would result in the manage
ment of The principal railway systems of
tho country passing under the control of
two families. A gigantic railroad trust
would thus be formed which would eclipse
In magnitude anything in the line of com
binations this country has yet seen.
"The combined wealth of Rockefeller
Brothersâ John D., Wiliam and Frank
on a conservative estimate reaches five
hundred million dollars, and William K.
VanderWlt the heirs of Cornelius and the
other branches of the Vanderbllt house
would easily bring the total capital of the
combination up to the billion dollar mark,
and perhaps even to a billion and a half
dollars.
â¢'Railroad men and financiers to-day bo
lieve that the Rockefellers are going to
assume tho control and direction of the i
Vanderbilt railroad Interests.
"In the West the effect of Rockefeller ]
control is likely to be felt in tho pushing ;
: of Mr. Vanderbilt's schema of a groat
' transcontinental lino."
The. World says: "The report that a
; billion dollar railroad combine has been
, formed between Vnnderbilt and the
j Rockefellers ip without any foundation
, whatever. The election of William Rocke
feller as director of the New -York Central
â¢ road means nothing whatever except an
I investment.
"It Is quite probable that William T\.
1 Vanderbilt may at an early day realize
â  the ambition of his family and own a
i transcontinental line connecting the
waters of the Atlantic and Pacific, but
the report that ho has secured control of
the Southern Pacific road through Bp#yer
&' Co. la not true. Speyer & Co. are Ilunt
lngton brokers and would hardly carry
out Mr. Vanderbik's contrary instruc
tions."
TEACHERS WILL NOT
LOSE THEIR PLACES
SCHOOL BOAKD'S MISTAKE TO
BE RECTIFIED.
Through tho faulty verbiage of a reso
lution adopted by the Board of Education
at its last meeting twelv^ pedagogues
| lost not only their positions and per
! Quisites as "heads of departments" hut as
j teachers in the school department as
â¢well. It was not the intention of the Di
[ rectors to throw them out of the depart
i ment; the one object was to abolish the
j position of "departmental head" and save
to the depleted school fund the $15 per
month -which attaches to positions of that
classification.
As soon as the error was discovered a
meeting of the twelve heads involved -was
called and thoy came together at Super
intendent Webster's office at the City
Hall. The meeting had a double-barreled
object; to learn Just what was their
status in the department and to fight for
i the recreation of their old positions.
Superintendent Webster was called in and
upon the tlrst point was quick to reassure
them. He said that if through faulty
construction it was made to appear in the
resolution that they had bt-en dropped
from the department the mistake would
be rectified. Upon the second point he
held out no assurance.
The Board of Education, he explained,
considered that the position of head of
department had come to be little more
than honorary as there were no dis
tinctive responsibilities or duties attached
to It. This he expressed as his opinion,
but said he -would advise the discharged
heads to get together as a body and
formulate a certain line of duties other
than their regular obligations as teachers
In the department and then memorialize
the board to re-establish the positions.
The teachers did not agree with their
superintendent that they had not already
distinctive duties and responsibilities.
They argued that they were responsible
not only to the School Department of San
Francisco but as well to the faculty of
the State University. The departments
of which they -were the heads were all ac
credited by the State University and it
was obligatory upon them to see to it
that the teachers In the departments of
â which they had supervision brotight their
classes up to the standard set by the
State institution. They claimed that this
responsibility alone was worth the $15
per month -which -was added to their
monthly stipend.
They could not argue profitably, how
ever, in face of the opinion of the Board
of Education and finally decided to fol
low the advice of their superintendent
and memorialize the board for the re
establishment of the position and the
repayment of the $15 per month.

FIRE IN WESTERN ADDITION.
The O^Kane Residence Narrowly Es
capes Total Destruction.
The residence of W. D. O'Kane at 2119
Broadway had a narrow escape from total
destruction by lire yesterday afternoon,
shortly after 2 o'clock. The flames orig
inated, on the roof and were caused by a
spark from a chimney. Before the fire
could be subdued the entire top of the
structure had been destroyed, and tho
damage will amount to several thousand
dollars.
As soon as the fire was discovered an
alarm was turned in from box 25fi at Fill
more street and Pacific avenue. The Fire
Department was quick in responding:, but
the blaze had already gained considerable
headway and much difficulty was experi
enced in 'extinguishing it. as the fire was
confined between the roof and the ceiling
of the upper story. Much damage was
done tt> the interior of the structure by
water and articles of considerable value
wore ruined. W. D. O'Kane, owner of the
house, is one of the proprietors of the
"Union Transfer Company in this city.

SUIT FOR POSSESSION
OF MISSION ROCK
TJNTTED STATES WANTS IT FOB
A COALING STATION.
United States Attorney Coombs yester
day prepared a complaint to be filed to
day in the United States Circuit Court
asking for th<j ejectment of the California
Drydock Company from Mission Rock, in
San Francisco Bay. The United States
Government wants the rock to be used as
a coaling station. The complaint recites
that the patent issued by the State of
California In 1870 is valid only as to what
ever lands may have been at that time
under the sovereignty of the State, but
contends that no State patent can hold as
against the United States in the case of
any Islands or other realty over which
the United States has sovereignty.
' Mr. Coombs said yesterday that it had
been held by the courts that the United
States is entitled to the islands in the
bay of San Francisco and to all the tide
lands in the State and lands that
are covered and uncovered by the
ebb and flow of tides reaching
these lands at ordinary high tides. All
lands below ordinary high tides belong to
the State.
There will be two contests in the trial
of the case â one as to what the area of
Mission Rock was at the time it was
filled in and whether it consisted of a
Jutting rock or whether the lands about
it were above ordinary high-water mark.
Mr. Coombs will also present this ques
tion, as to whether tide and submerged
lands, the title to which is vested in the
Stat< j by reason of its sovereignty, can
pertain to those tide lands which sur
round islands where the State has no
sovereignty.
The latter is a new point, and its treat
ment by the court and counsel will be of
much interest.

ACCUSED THEM FALSELY.
A Colored Sailor Brutally Beats a
Japanese and His Wife.
George Allen, a colored sailor on a
coasting vessel, while drunk last night
had a racket in an Oneida-place house,
which caused a charge of assault with a
deadly weapon and one of battery to be
placed against his name at the California
street station. Shortly after Allen had
entered the alley he claimed that he had
been robbed of $45 by a Japanese woman.
He promptly beat her husband, S. Aru
nura on the head with a chair and as
saulted the woman with his fists. Aru
nura suffered considerably from his
wounds and the woman was badly In
jured. Officers Dinan and "Williams "final
ly arrested the sailor after a desperate
struggle. When searched at the police
station Allen still had the $45 in his pos- i
session.
