LONDON Nov. B.â The British Foreign
Office to-day gave out a statement In re
gard to the Samoan agreement similar to
that Issued in Berlin; showing that the.
United * States gets Tutuila and other Sa
inoan islands east of the one hundred and
Bevehty-flrst degree of longitude.
WASHINGTON, Nov. B.â The State De-"
partment has not yet been advised of the
agreement between Great Britain and
Germany respecting the Bamoan Group.
It Is gathered, however, that If the out
line of the arrangement set out in the
â¢ able advices is accurate there will be no
â¢ Imposition to withhold our approval, pro
vided certain minor conditions are in
ciuded.

tion of the United States. This was nee-
The San Francisco Call.
eseary as the change proposed could be
made only by formal treaty, which would
require the approval of the Senate. It
is believed that the arrangement proposed
now will be sent to the State Department.
The United States Is not concerned with
the amount or character of the compen
sation that passes between the other na- I
tions. Besides retaining the coaling sta
tion of Pago Pago, acquiring the island
of Tutuila, whereon the harbor is located,
and the three or four small islets in the
vicinity, the United States will continue
to Joy by stipulation the privilege of
; trading with Apia under conditions equal
ly as favorable as those existing. The
islets referred to are not of any particu
lar importance from a commercial point
of view, but It is deemed essential to con
| trol them politically In order to prevent
smuggling.
The partition of the Samoan group of ]
islands marks the close of a long-stand
ing source of international controversy
and also brings about new territorial .ar
rangements in the South Pacific. In the j
early stage of the negotiations It was ,
agreed that the United States should have i
the island of Tutuila, with its valuable ;
harbor of Pago Pago and the lesser isl
ands of its coast, including the large islet
of Manua. The negotiations then shifted
to London to determine whether Germany
or England should retain the two remain
ing islands. The nature of these later ne
gotiations has been constantly commu
nicated to Washington, although they ,
have not reached the State Department,
and it has been known for some days
that in case Great Britain retired from
Samoa, Germany would give as part com
pensation the large Solomon islands of I '
San Isabel and Choiseul. These are near j
; the British possessions in Australia, being '
east of New Guinea. They are twice the
size of the Samoan group, but the country
i is mountainous and the people warlike,
many being cannibals.
At the British and German embassies
here the announcement of the close of
negotiations was received with much sat- |
Isfactiou. A high diplomatic official said .
that the agreement wad due mainly to the
fact that German public sentiment was
averse to retiring from Samoa, and yield
ing to this sentiment Great Britain had
solved the matter by taking an equivalent
in territory elsewhere.

MAJOR M'GRATH DIES
FROM HIS INJURIES
WASHINGTON. Nov. B.â A cable mes

of Noveleta, a month ago. Major Mc-

CONFLICTING STORIES OF
THE BATTLES IN NATAL
Reported Annihilation of the Fifth Lancers
Followed by British Versions That the
Boers Lost Most Heavily.
Botha's Hill Cut Near Pietermaritzburg.
This important passway is closely guarded against a sudden raid by the Boers, or damage by their sympa
thizers in Natal. A small party in a short while could work such extensive damage as to cut off the country above
from the sea for two weeks or more.
PARIS, Nov. B.â lnformation has been received in diplomatic circles
that in Friday's battle near Ladysmith the Fifth Lancers were annihilated.
Six hundred of them were killed, wounded or taken prisoners. Four hun
dred horses were captured.
FSTCOURT, Natal, Xov. 6.â Mr. Burned, proprietor of the Railway Hotel at Lady
smith, has arrived here with a companion, having eluded the Boer outposts by night, riding along
Kaffir paths. He confirms the report that when General White requested that the women and chil
dren be permitted to depart General Joubert replied that he would only allow them to get away un
der the muzzles or fire of his guns. Mr. Burnard views the situation gravely and says that none of
the British artillery is apparently able to cope with the Boer siege guns.
LONDON, Nov. 9. â A dispatch from Durban gives details which, though rather indefinite,
seem to show that the Natal volunteers are moving the big guns, which are not sufficiently mo
bile for field use, from Estcourt to Pietermaritzburg to assist in the defense of the latter in the
event of an attack. Advices from Naauwpoort, Cape Colony, filed Monday morning, say that on
learning that the Boers were relaying the rails at Norvals Pont r the Railway Department the pre
vious day destroyed the culvert between Arundel and Tweedale.
DURBAN, Nov. 5. â Other information confirms the statement of native eye-witnesses de
scribing the severity of the fighting on both Friday and Saturday at Ladysmith. The natives as
sert that the Boers were so cut up that they howled for mercy on the field and covered their
bodies. Ladysmith is crowded with Boer prisoners and wounded, the latter presenting horrible
evidence of the swordsmanship of the cavalry. The Gordon Highlanders suffered severely in the
fighting.
LONDON, Nov. B.â To the eyes of
military experts the darkest page
of the war IS now being written.
But even that is illuminated with
bright passages, such as General
White's victorious sorties. If ho
can keep the British flap: flying over
Ladysmlth until he is relieved, the cam
paign will turn a frosh page and with
the advance of Sir Redvers Buller's force
the British public is promised more cheer
ful reading.
This feeling- of relief inspired by recent
good tidings is nevertheless tinged by a
certain anxiety lest General White should
again make some fatai- miscalculation, in
volving a repetition of the Nicholsens
Nek disaster. Her Majesty does not share
this anxiety and apparently Is sanguine
of his ability to pull through successfully.
It is asserted that she has written to
I-ady White expressing sympathy with
her husband In the trials and difficulties
he Is now experiencing and assuring I^ady
White of her own undlmlnished confidence
In his generalship. The purport of this
letter has been cabled to General White
by the Marquis of Lansdowne.
The most interesting news to-night is
a dispatch from Estcourt announcing the
departure of a strong force of mounted
troops and artillery for a destination not
given In the advices. Another message
announces the arrival at Estcourt and
Pietermarltzburg within the last few days
of reinforcements from Durban, and that
3500 troops are assembled ready for an
advance to Colenso when the opportune
moment arrives. The latter dispatch
throws light upon the former, and the
TO SHOW THE WORLD WHAT
AMERICAN WOMEN CAN DO
LONDON, Nov. B.â At the request of the Associated Press. L*dy Randolph Churchill made to-day the following
statement to American friends with regard to the project of American women in England of fitting out a hospital shin
for use in South African waters:
"The time for fitting out the Maine is so brief that Tarn glad to avail myself of the Associated Press to set the
project fairly before the American public. The interest manifested by Americans has already taken such tangible form
from New York to San Francisco that I am sure that an intimation that what remaining work there is to do must be
done Immediately will spur the American public into a ready response to our needs. There is but one motive, one
reason, for the project of sending a hospital ship to the Cape. We have had oratory and societies for the promotion of
Anglo-American friendship. This is the golden opportunity to put that expression of good will into tangible form
It is especially the province of American women to promote this cause, but it is woman's function to foster and nourish
the suffering. American people are more adept at It, we believe, than any others. The Maine is to be essentiaJly an
American woman's ship. We are not only to aid thÂ« suffering, but are to show the world that American women can do
that good work better than any one else can do it. I am going to the Cape in the Maine, not because my son is there,
for he will be a thousand miles away, but because I want the generous efforts of American contributors to be carried
out under the personal supervision of a member of an executive committee. I am going because I think I may prevent
any kind of friction between the American nurses whom Mrs. Whitelaw Reid is sending out on Saturday and the
British officials, in case such friction should arise. I contribute that much time and service gladly, and all our com
mittee would do the same. The Maine will be a success and we hope American contributions, already given so generously,
will within the next few days insure that success beyond a doubt."
force which left Estconrt Monday hns
doubtless reoccupied Colenso and possi
bly is now advancing cautiously up the
railroad toward Ladysmith, General
White's sortie of Friday almost to the
banks of the Tuge.la River encouraging
Its commander in the hope of joining
hands with him.
General Joubcrt, the latest advices
would indicate, drew In his horns after
Friday's engagement and lias sinoo with
drawn the southern Boer contigent, leav-
Ing only outposts on the line from Lady
smith to Colenso. Tho Boers who occu
pied Colenso about the middle of last
week retired without damaging Bulwer
bridge over the Tugela River or the rail
road as far north as the village of Nel
thropo, sÂ»vpn miles south of Ladysmith.
Evidently they nurse a hope of eventually
utilizing both In their descent on Pieter
marltzburg. Meanwhile the British are
also able to use both as they have al
ready done. In running up an armored
train which may at the present moment
be covering the advance of the Estcourt
forces.
At Estcourt and Pietermarltzburg tho
defensive works have been greatly
strengthened within the last few days,
and they are now believed capable of
holding their own against any Boer force
which General Joubert could at the pres
ent juncture risk pending against either
town. Both are likely to be strengthened
before the week is out by a further naval
force, and even by the first detachment
of General Buller's army corps.
None of the troopships have arrived.
The one which it was predicted might
reach Tape Town at the earliest on Mon
day is as yet unannounced, and even
when it does arrive there it will have
three days' steaming to reach Durban.
As many as six transports, with 4500
troops, were expected to be in Cape Town
harbor by this time, but the War Office
last evening issued a statement to the
effect that the only arrivals at Cape
Town were the Sumatra, from Durban,
with wounded; the Southern Cross, from
Gibraltar, with mules, and the collier
Wenvoe. Of course, it is possible that
dispatch boats have been sent to meet the
troopships with instructions to proceed
direct to Durban, and in that event the
War Office statement that not one has ar
rived at Cape Town would be accurate.
even though several should be half way
between Cape Town and Durban.
The situation looks brighter at Mafe
king, where the Boers are apparently dis
heartened at the unexpected resistance,
a large body of their force having been
detached to the south to assist in the In
vestment of Kimberley, around which the
cordon Is drawing tighter. Evidently the
Boers intend to make a concentrated ef
fort to capture Kimberley and that arch
enemy, Cecil Rhodes.
The reported departure of a Boer con
tingent from Pretoria, with German ar
tillery gunners, moving in a southerly
direction, is taken to mean co-operation in
the invasion of the northern part of
''ape Colony, an undertaking which has
thus far not progressed very rapidly.
Reports of a treacherous use of the
white flag by the Boers, coming from
native sources, are not received with
complete credulity, but at the same time
DEWEY DIFFERS FROM
LIEUTENANT CALKINS
Admiral Objects to the Statement
That There Were Neither Mines
Nor Torpedo = Boats in
Manila Bay.
CALL HEADQUARTERS. "WELLINCt-
TON HOTEL. WASHINGTON, Nov. B.â
Admiral Dewey has yielded to the temp
tations of the letter-writing habit to the
extent of an exception to the report of
the operations in Manila Bay writt<
Lieutenant C. G. Calkins, navigating offi
cer of the Olympia. and published in che
June issue of the Naval Institute.
It has been Dewey's custom to let pass
unnoticed all reports, correct and Incor- i
rect, of the battle of Manila, but when
the article by Lieutenant Calkins ap
peared in the Institute he broke his rule i
and wrote to the Chief of the Bureau of !
Navigation, Admiral Crowninshleld, ask- i
ing that his official report of the battle ;
be published in the Institute, as the one
by Lieutenant Calkins differed from it in
several particulars. In the last issue of |
the Institute Dewey's report appeared,
with ' a letter from Admiral Crownln- j
shield and Dewey's letter to him. !
It seems from the two accounts that
there was quite a difference of opinion ;
between the admiral and his navigating â 
officer in figuring on the probable inten- '
tions of a small boat that put out from
the shore and lay across the bows of the !
Olympla during the fight. The admiral
says in his report that it was there with
the "apparent intention" of using torpe
does; Lieutenant Calkins says it was a
market boat. The admiral speaks of two
such Intruders; Lieutenant Calkins says
there was but one. The admiral also
speaks of mines exploded ahead of the
flagship, but Lieutenant Calkins writes I
that, on the authority of one of the Span- !
ish captains, there were no mines and no
torpedo-boats in the harbor.
In regard to these differences the ad
miral has made his first attempt at pub
lication in the following to Admiral i
Crowninshield:
There has come to my notice a copy of the .
United States Naval Institute, which contains, i
an article by Lieutenant Carlos G. Calkins, j
United States navy, purporting to be a histor- |
ical account of the operations in Manila Bay i
during my command of the United States
naval forces there. It has not been my cus
tom to notice numerous incorrect accounts of
those operations, nor do I desire to engage in
any controversy with the writer of the paper
mentioned, In matters of opinion, but as the
article has appeared in a publication which is
understood to have the official sanction of the
department, and as it contains statements as
facts, conflicting with my official reports, I
consider it necessary to ask that the depart
ment will requtst the Naval Institute t v publish
in its next issue my official report of the bat
tle of Manila Bay, which is absolutely correct
In all essentials.
In his official report the admiral stated
thatâ "Early in the engagement two
launches put out toward the Olympia
with the apparent intention of using tor
pedoes. One was sunk and the other was
disabled by our fire, and was beached be
fore an opportunity occurred to fire the
torpedoes. While advancing to the at
tack two mines were exploded ahead of
the flagship, too far to be effective."
Lieutenant Calkins In his account says:
LIEUTENANT C. G. CALKINS, Former Navigating
Officer of the Olympia.
their reiteration Is making an unfavorable
impression. One paper asks sarcastically
whether President Kruger's reforence in
his message to America to "staggering
humanity" meant the use of the Boer
white flag.
NO LATE NEWS FROM
THE SEAT OF WAR
LONDON. Nov. 9.â There is practically
no further news from the seat of war this
morning. It is asserted under Sunday
date from Estcourt that General White
received a message from Sir Redvera Bul
ler on Saturday. So far, however, no mes
sage appears to have been received in
London from General White concerning
Thursday's and Friday's sorties.
A special dispatch from I'i.termaritz
burg. dated Sunday, says: "it is confi
dently expected that railway communica
tion will be restored with Ladysmith
within a few hours."
Further details from Maiekin*. carry-
PTCICE FIVE CENTS.
Just as our line got fairly engaged a dis
tracting element appeared. A small steam
launch with awnings spread and a big Spanish
ensign streaming astern advanced from the
cove i .'hind Sangley Point, crossed the bows
of the Olympia and then turned toward the
shore as it" to lie in wait for that formidable
antagonist. There could be but one interpreta
tion into this movement. This was a torpedo
boat and she had to be treated as such. Sec
ondary batteries began to pick up her range and
their shells were soon veiling the target in
spray and smoke. A few rounds were fired
from even the main batteries, while the ma
rines did all that may be accomplished with
Springfields at 1200 yards ran^e: yet the reck
less craft still floated, though no longer able
to steam or disposed to use any weapon. She
drifted ashore under the guns at Sangley
Point, where she continued to draw the fire
from the six-pounders. In spite of the keen re
monstrance from high authorities, until the
action was over.
It seems proved that the launch was no
deadly microbe, but only a humble market
boat manned by Filipinos and bound to Manila
by the direction of an English family residing
at the Canacao littorat. The Oriental manner of
executing the domestic routine amid the shock
and thunder of battle eliminates the heroic
from an action of amazing rashness. â¢ â¢ â¢
After reducing this alarm to its lowest terms
It becomes necessary to strike out all rumors
of a second mythical torpedo-boat. No respon
sible witness has been found to locate or de
scribe this apparition, although some fell Into
the natural error of a duplication of the legend.
Perhaps the erasing angel should also blot
out the report of submarine mines exploded
ahead of the Olympia before the ships opened
fire. Such an explosion, miles ahead of our ad
vane, should indicate nothing but panic.
Against testimony of many sincere eye-wit
nesses stands the statement of Captain Concha,
commanding the Don Juan de Austria on May
1. This intelligent and disinterested observer
denies the existence of any submarine mlnea
or the presence of any improvised torpedo-boat
oft Cavtte. This statement leaves some of us
face to face with illusions of vision or mem-
I ory.
Lieutenant Calkins is now in charge of
the hydrographic office in this city. His
attention was called to the letter of the
admiral yesterday, but he would act a.s
--i cuss the subject.
"My article for the Institute was not
submitted as finally correct," he said.
"It was simply my own impressions and
what I had heard of the operations. I
saw the boat spoken of. and T learned
afterward what it was. The admiral does
not say it was a torpedo-boat, or that
cither of them was a torpedo-boat: he
says two boats were there with the ap
parent intention of using torpedoes. I
thought I saw mines exploded before we
went Into action, but I afterward learned
there were no mines, and I gave my
reason for my belief in what I wrote.
"I Baw the last number of the Institute
and read the admiral's letter, but that is
all I know of the affair. What i wrote I
wrote in good faith. As I say it does
not purport to be absolutely correct. It
is a record of what I saw and what I
learned, but it is not official, nor do I
wish to contradict any statements made
In the official report."

and that rabbit holes- had been excavated

HOAR STANDS
BY AGUINALDO
Completely Reviews the
Situation.
TIME RIPE FOR ACTION
AN AGREEMENT SHOULD BE
MADE AT ONCE.
Holds That the Government Should
Aid the Islanders in Forming
a Government to Their
Liking.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK. Nov. B.â Senator George
F. Hoar of Massachusetts has contrib
uted an article on "<>ur Duty to the
Philippines" to the Independent, which
will appear to-morrow. He begins with
a review of the circumstances leading up
to the war with Spain, of which he pays:
I think it might have been averted and that
Cuba could have been liberated by peaceable
means if the counsel of Grant and Fish had
been followed and if our public men in the
Senate had remembered that they were a part
of the diplomatic power of this country and
that it was unbecoming in them to indulge bit
ter an. i stinging invectives against Spain,
whether such Invectives were Just or unjust.
But I do not feel inclined to Judge these utter
ances severely. Something, as Burke said,
must be pardoned to the spirit of liberty, and
those utterances, though in my Judgment, un
fortunate, came from brave, numane and lib
erty-loving souls.
Continuing the Senator pays that down
to January 1. 1899, the American people
and the Republican party were romrrrit
ted to the doctrine that just government
rests upon the consent of the jsroverned
and that every people has the right to
dissolve at will the political connection
thai binds it to another people. "In deal
ing with <'uha," says the writer, "we
a< ted upon those principles, but the treaty
of peace disclosed a different purpose as
to tile Philippines, the inhabitants of
which were much nearer independence
when ihe treaty of peace was Finned than
ever had been the people of Cuba."
Their leader had been brought over
to the. islands in a United States ship by
the United States authorities and was In arms
nt the he. id oi his forces, with our full con
currence an.l '"â --"eratioti. If the statement
attributed to a high official In one of our de
partments, who Is somet | called on to sit
In the Cabinet with the President, were ac
tually made, their leader had been offered by
President McKlnley the high office of colonel
In the regular army of the United State?, an
offer which Itself la a sufficient refutation of
all the charges again?! him. They had framed
a provisional constitution, a model of its kind,
and establishing a dictatorship like those es
tablished by Bolivar In South America to give
place to a republic as soon as the military
condition should make it possible.
Looking back, an any sane man doubt the
wisdom of those who desired to amend the
treaty and to deal with the Philippine Islands
as we did with Cuba: to compel Spain to re
nounce her sovereignty; to keep off all foreign
nations. and to aid tho Islanders in establishing
their own government according to their own
desires?
The Senator refers to the epithet
"traitor" and other harsh words applied
to those who voted against the peace
treaty, and askÂ«:
Wh'ii the President said that forcible an
nexation, according to mir American code of
. would be criminal aggression, wnÂ» he
.1 Â« -.ij.n. -rh.-,id : Was he disloyal to the Bag 7
Was noi he a Republican? Was there even an
utterance so calculated to Rive courage -to
â  ,; his i eople ;is that?
As to cur future attitude toward the
Philippines, Senator Hoar writes:
The time has come to make up your minds.
If you are to declare that you do not ni;an
to subjugate them or to enslave them, that
you will act toward them on the principles
and spirit of your own declaration of Inde
pendence, the war can be ended in an hour.
The refusal to make this declaration In the
beginning brought on this war arid your re
fusal now to declare yourselves Is what Is
alone responsible /or Its continuance.
X. v we have got to nettle the question,
which the President has repeatedly declared
Is for Congress or for the people, whether we
will complete the subjection of the Filipinos;
whether we will undertake to govern them as
subjects or serfs; or whether we will aid them
to become a self-governing nation, either as
a republic as they Beem to desire, or as a
limited monarchy like Japan, or whether they
shall exist hereafter ap an absolute monarchy
after the fashion we are maintaining In power
to-day the Sultan of Kulu, with his slaves and
his harem.
Senator Hoar then writes that thlspreat
question has been discussed with a lev
ity, with an Intolerance and with an ap
peal to l"w motives and to cheap pas
rarely paralleled in political his
hlstory. A notable exception? he say?, is
Governor Roosevelt, whose lat<* address,
in which he maintains that expansl in is
th<- way to peace, was a "thoughtful and
abli argument, worthy of serioue consid
eration/ In conclusion the Senator says:
The American people, the brave and just
people, who made the Immortal declaration,
and . who maintained with life and fortune
their sacred honor, who established our won
derful constitution, to whose Monroe doctrine
Is due the freedom of the American continent
from the Rio Grande to Cape Horn, have not
changed their character or their principles In
the twinkling of an eye under the temptation
of any base motive or personal advantage, or
under the excitement of war. They are sub
ject, doubtless, as all musses of men are.
however Intelligent or however right, to great
waves of passion.
But their sober second thought Is to he
trusted. Their deliberate action will he wise
and Just. The great passions by which they
are stirred and by which their judgment IS
now cluoded are generous, noble and humane.
Reason will resume Its rightful sway and the
great republic will remain a republic still.
COURT-MARTIAL FINDINGS
NOT YET OPENED
WASHINGTON, Nov. B.â The four
cases of court-martial death sentence of
boldiera in the Philippines which reached
the War Department hy yesterday's mall

tary of War. The men tinder sentence
are Private Otto Conine, Corporal George
Damphoffr-r and Private Peter Bennett,
all of Company B, Sixteenth Infantry, and
Private William E. Scarborough, Com
pany B. Third Infantry. These cases will
have to go to the Secretary of War and
thrnoe to the President for approval. The
executive action cannot he forecasted,
hut It is generally understood here that
in case the sentences are not commuted
liy the President it is more than likely
that tho attorneys for the convicted men
will endeavor by technical flaws in the
proceedings* to prevent the imposition of
the extreme penalty. It is understood aliso
that General Otis' approval of the sen
i tenee was coupled with a recommenda
: tion of mercy. To make this recommen-
I dation the general would have to approve
the Bentence, as he has the right to dis
approve the sentence in toto, but not ..o

TWO BOYS ATTACHED
BY A LARGE DEER
Had Only a \-\ammer to DefeQd
Themselves With, but Fought
Courageously.
SALINAS, Nov. B.â An almost unheard of ocurrence is reported near this
City. Willie Condon and Bert Lang, two boys about 10 years of age. both res
idents of this city, while out in the mountains on horseback were attacked by
a large buck deer and narrowly escaped death. Both lads' horses were gored
by the deer and badly wounded. Assistance arrived just In time to save the
boys from severe, if not fatal. Injuries. Condon and Lang rode out to the
Lang and Dorn colony In the east foothills, and while there visited vari us
canyons and other places where deer have been seen. They were not out
hunting: and consequently carried no weapons save a hammer, with which
they intended to nail some boards on a fence.
The dogs which were with thorn rustled up a large buck and drove it to
ward the boys. The animal was driven in a corner of the fence, but Instead of
jumping it. charged at the Intruders. The antlers penetrated one horse's belly.
The boy with the hammer rode up close and struck the buck. This all the
more infuriated him and as a result the stomach of the second horse was lac
erated by the deer's horns. The boys fought as courageously as possible, but
were no match for the buck. The barking of the dogs and cries from the hoys
attracted the attention of men chopping wood near by and they rushed to
their assistance. After a stubborn fight the buck was corralled and finally
shot. The lads escaped with slight injuries.
AMERICANS ARE
NOT MISTRUSTED
Cuban Sentiment Grows
More Friendly.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Nov. S.â Brigadier Gen- j
eral Ludlnw, Military Governor of
Havana, who arrived In New 1 ork liar
bor yestsrday afternoon on the steamer
Havana and was detained in quarantine, I
paid:
I am glad to say that the feeling; of Cubans
toward Americansâ Whether the military repre
sentatives of the Government or othersâ has i
Kreatly Improved during recent months. The J
suspicion and distrust with which, perhaps, a
large number regarded Americans tor so long
a time after the military occupation was es
tablished hns given way in a great measure
to confidence and cordiality. They are con
vinced now, I think, that our purposes are
honest and friendly and limited to the or
ganization and development which are essen
tial precursors of the establishment of a stable
native government. Along with this conviction
11. >ts goes a perception of the tact that t-hese pre
limlnaries are not to be accomplished so easily
and soon as seemed to them at first. In yther .
words, they see that our conception of the task
In hand was truer than their own, and the
most influential and intelligent are now content j
to lave us work out the problem before en- j
trusting the conduct of affairs wholly to them. !
The more we do the less there will be for them
to do and the more auspiciously will the re
publlc start upon its career.
The necessity of doing our part of the work
thoroughly, so that there shall be the smallest
possible chance for a failure of self-govern
ment, makes It very difficult to say when the j
military occupation ought to end. There must, ;
ni any" rate, I should miv, be a complete or
ganization of the civil Government and an
experimental operation of it under some degree
Of military supervision before the armed regime
is terminated and the island handed over ab
solutely to Us own people.
The organizing of a civil Government is pro
ceeding prosperously throughout the cities and
towns Of the island. In many it is perfected;
in ethers it is well under way; In the rest It
Is either being undertaken or about to be.
In Havana, of course, we have had for some
months a complete municipal organization and
administration, but under military supremacy,
whi :h, however, is exercised no more than Is
deemed necessary.
Among the final preparations for the full as
sumption Of authority by the Cabana will be
the election of a constitutional assembly. The
date for that election has not been fixed, nor
have the details which must attend it been
worked out either by our Government or by
the Cuban leaders themselves. Hence I am I
unable to reply to questions touching the condi
tions under which the election will be held.
In regard to the suggestion of an educational
ttÂ«t f.<r the electors a difficulty arises In the
fart that !>0 per cent of the population is illit
erate. It Is evident that if the new republic
is> to be a popular Government there cannot
be much of educational requirements for the
exercise of suffrage. In short, particulars re
lating to the constitutional organization of
Cuba still belong to the future.
FITZHUGH LEE ON THE
SITUATION IN CUBA
NEW YORK. Nov. B.â "The Future of
Cuba" Is a paper by Major General Kitz
hugh Lee, which will appear In the Inde
pendent to-morrow, as follows:
When will the United States evacuate Cuba?
That Is a question 1 am frequently asked, ana
I purpose it Is natural for people to suppose
I that from my peculiar facilities for observation
. In the island 1 might have some knowledge, or
at least some opinion about It.
Nevertheless, 1 have no such knowledge and
no such opinion. With the very best of will
on the part of our Government, j. desire to keep
its pledges and leave the inhabitants of Cuba
to enjoy their Independence In their own way,
there are many difficulties in the way of with
drawal, and whether or not we hare In the last
six months made progress toward the end I am'
unable to Fay.
Vet I can- say that during the last six months
crime has decreased, .'Hi 1 p. -ace and prosperity
are spreading or reviving In a great measure.
This, however, seems attributable to the pres
ence of the United States troops, whom the
' property-holders and chief men Insist must
! stay. The Cubans themselves seem to be very
much divided In opinion as to what ought to be
done. Some want an Independent republic Im
mediately. Others insist that Cuba shall be an
nexed to the United States, and great num
bers of others seem to have no positive opin
ions concerning the path their country should
pursue. There is, of course, on the part of a
majority a lack of understanding of the diffi
culties of self-government.
At present the census In being taken In Cuba,
and for the first time- we shall have an accu
rate and reliable enumeration. When that has
been finished the experiment of free govern
ment by Cubans for Cubans will. I believe, be
tried. Precisely In what locality or in what
form I do not know. That is a matter for our
Government to decide, and I have obtnlned no
Information of Its intentions In the matter.
If it Is found that the Cubans can organize
I and maintain a government in their island that
will protect life a.nd property, undoubtedly we
shall withdraw and allow them to go their way
along the path of independence, accompanied
by nothing more embarrassing than our very
best wishes.
But at present all Is tentative, all attempts
at government are merely experimental, and
not being a prophet, I am unable to say what
the future holds for the Pearl of the Antilles.
I sincerely hope that It Is happiness and pros
perity In their greatest abundance and In high
| est form. -' ______________

REPUBLICAN GAINS CONSIDERED
AN ADMINISTRATION VICTORY
President and Cabinet Officials Are Highly Gratified Over the
Result in Eastern States.
Evidence That the Sun of Bryanism Is Setting, and That the Latter-Day Democracy
Is Gradually Losing Ground Even in Sections Which Have Been
Regarded as Its Strongholds.

TEL, WASHINGTON, Nov. B.â
Administration officials declare
that President McKinley's perma
nent retention of the Philippine Is
lands and the gold standard were
i emphatically indorsed by the elections yes
terday. No official Is more delighted than
!is the President. Since his return to the
White House this afternoon he has been
showered with congratulations from all
j parts of the country, one of the most
| Scant telegrams being from Senator
I Foraker, who now stands squarely with
i the administration forces.
Mr. McKinley from the beginning of the
j contest never wavered in his confidence
of Ohio giving a large Republican ma
jority, and his predictions, which were
! regarded us extravagant before the elec
; tion, have been strikingly verified. He
said to some of his callers to-day that
I considering all circumstances he regarded
I the result of the election in Ohio as the
greatest Republican victory in the his
tory of the State. Friends of the Presi
dent say the anti-expansionists can get
little satisfaction from the returns. They
I point out that in every part of the coun
| try where local issues and factional quar
rels did not enter into the campaign and
j where the fight was made squarely on
expansion and other national Issues
heavy Republican gains are reported.
This is nowhere more noticeable than in
lowa, where expansion was the principal
issue.
Administration officials declare that In
i Ohio it was the strength of the expansion
issue among the farmers that held the
State in line for the President. Had Mr.
I Nash done no better in the country pre
cincts than Mr. McKinley did when he
ran for President in 1890, they say he
would have lost the State. |
' Administration officials are not disposed
, to attach great importance to the Repub
; lican reverse in Maryland, because they
say the disaster was Invited by factional
lights in the party. The Republicans get
' some satisfaction out of the fact that Mr.
Smith and Mr. Raynor, the successful
. candidates for Governor and Attorney
I General, are uncompromising gold Demo
-1 crats, so that Maryland cannot be said
to have indorsed Bryanism. Nebraska's
vote is believed to insure- Bryan's renom
! ination next year, notwithstanding the de
sire of many Democratic leaders to be rid
1 of him.
There has been much speculation in
' Washington on the effect of the over
throw of the Republicans in Cleveland,
Senator Hanna's home, and upon the Sen
ator's future relations with the adminis
â¢ tration and the Republican campaign
I committee. Mr. Jones' success there is
' generally assumed to be a severe blow at
i the prestige of the Senator, and predic
: tions are freely made that it will force
; him to give up the leadership of the
: party, but one official contended that no
i such conclusion should be drawn.
The election of Taylor as Governor of
i Kentucky is regarded as making: that
j State debatable ground in the Presidential
election next year. The animosities en
; gendered by the campaign. It is thought,
I will hardly be entirely healed by next
I year, and with Bryan making the race on
| a free coinage platform the Republicans
: can give the Democrats a hard fight.
Secretary of the Treasury Gage, com
! menting on the elections, emphasised the
indorsement they gave to sound money.
He sent a telegram to Governor Shaw of
lowa congratulating him upon the in
creased sound money majority in that
State upon a platform declaring for the
gold standard.
"I was especially pleased by the result
â  In lowa," Secretary Gage said, "because
1 the Democratic leaders were predicting
' heavy gains there and were insisting that
j the German voters were more opposed to
the policy of the President in the Pacific
than they were to free silver. The result
seems to show that whatever their opin
ions were on our policy in the East they
i realized the paramount importance of put
| ting the country on a sound monetary
basis."
Secretary Hay, Attorney General Grigg3
! and Secretary Wilson all expressed sat
i isfaction with the result.
OHIO PLURALITY GROWS.
Republicans Have Fifty Thousand
Votes to the Good.
COI/T7MBUB, Ohio, Nov. B.â The statis
ticians at the Republican headquarters
have been busy all day and night en
oeavoring to secure some accurate figures
on the plurality of Judge Nash, the Re
| publican candidate for Governor, and to
i night an unofficial table of pluralities by
i counties *as completed. This shows that
In fifty-seven counties Nash has 51, 399
over McLean, and in thirty-one counties
McLean has 34,035 over Nash. This gives
Nash over McLean in the State Â£0,364. It
I is not believed the otlicial returns will
' make any important changes in the
figures. No figures are available on the
total vote of the State, as the committee
I sought to obtain only pluralities. Not
; v.itiiPtnn.ling efforts were made to get
I the vote for Jones, returns have been ob
i talnr-d from oniy forty of the elghry
-1 eight counties. These include the
i counties in which the heaviest Jones vote
! was polled, and shnw a total f 84.000.
The remaining counties will swell the
Jones vote to 100,000.
The Republican il purrs on the Legls

Taylor's Plurality Estimated Rt
About Eight Thousand.
LOUISVILLE. Ky., Nov. B.â No matter
what result the face of the returns of
yesterday's election shows a contest Is
very likely to occur. Additional returns
received to-day and to-night continue v,
Show Republican pains, and, basing an
estimate upon the normal complexion of
the precincts still unreported, indicate a
p] trallty of 6000 to BOOT for W. B. Taylor
for Governor. The belated returns are
mostly from mountain counties, which
ar< strongly Republican. The Eleventh
District, which In W> save McKinley a
plurality of 19,000, i - only about half ie

In this district give Taylor pluralities ag
gregatins; 12,062, indicating that the R.
,ms have carried the district by
about the s.-ime figures as in 1886.
The Goebel people cling to their claim
of a plurality of 5000 In the State, thesn
figures being the estimate made by tho
nominee himself to-night.
At Republican headquarters in this dtjr
Taylor's plurality Is placed at 8000. In
neither case Is it possible to get the fig
ures upon which the claim is based, each
THE SAN FRANCISCO CAI/L, THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 9, 1899.
Bide evidently fearing that giving pub
licity to the reports of its agents through
out the State might work to the advan
tage of its opponent in the event of a
contest.
Almost complete returns from Louisville
and Jefferson County do not change last
I night's estimate of a Republican plural
i ity of a little over 3000. Governor Brad
: ley is still In the city and announces that
he will remain here for several days.
In view of the probability of a contest
1 over the vote for Governor, this state
ment made by Chairman Long of the Re
i publican State Campaign Committee, at
11 o'clock to-night, is significant. Said
Mr. Long: ;"â '.
"The Legislature is close, but I think
we have lost both houses. From semi-of
ficial returns from all counties except
twelve and careful estimates from these
we have carried the State by 8000 plurality
for Taylor."
In the event of a contest it will come
before the Legislature. This is the case
only with the offices of Governor and
Lieutenant Governor. The law covering
this point provides that a board for de
termining a contest for Governor shall
be chosen in the Legislature by lot, the
Senate selecting three and the House
eight members. The decision of this board
is not final nor conclusive. It must re
port to the General Assembly, where fur
ther action may be taken.
To-night's developments bring the Leg
islature into prominence because of the
probability that it will ultimately have
to determine who is to be the next Gov
ernor of Kentucky. In all expressions
upon the result of the election coming
from Democratic headquarters, the Leg
islature has been claimed as safe for that
party. No statement of its make-up has
been given, but it is probable a number
of members claimed by the Democrats
are not Goebel men. If the strength of
the two great parties is nearly equal
these anti-Goebel Democrats probably
would hold the balance of power, thus
furnishing all the elements for a repeti
tion of the bitter contest of 1597, which re
sulted in the defeat of Blackburn for the
United States Senate. While the returns
on the head of the ticket are incomplete,
but little attention has been paid to the
figures on members of the Legislature,
and until the contest between leaders is
cleared up somewhat, it will be hard to
get an accurate estimate of the relative
strength of the parties in the Assembly.
FRANKFORT, Ky., Nov. B.â Senator
Goebel arrived here at 8 o'clock to-night
and was met at the train by a crowd of
1500 enthusiastic admirers. From the bal
cony of the Capitol Hotel, where his head
quarters Is located, Mr. Goebel made a
speech, in which he said:
"I believe I have been elected; in fact,
I know I have. I see that my friend.
General Taylor, says he will assume the
office of Governor. All I have to say is
that If I have been elected, as I believe,
1 will be inaugurated in spite of the
Louisville and Nashville Railroad and
Bradley bayonets." â¢--','â *
Ex-Senator Blackburn also spoke,
claiming- Goebel's election by a slender
majority and calling on the people to see
to It mat he be seated.
CINCINNATI, Nov. B.â The following
is the Enquirer's estimate of the political
composition of the next Legislature in,
Kentucky. It is made from the best re
turns obtainable at the present time. The
figures are:

2 Populists. Total, 38.
Houseâ 37 Democrats, 40 Republicans, 3
Populists. Total, 100.
This gives the Democrats in the General
Assembly a majority of thirty-three votes
on joint ballot, exclusive of the five Popu
lists.
FRANKFORT, Ky., Nov. B.â Chairman
Blackburn of the Democratic State Cam
paign Committee, at midnight, gave the
following figures of the complexion of
the next Legislature: SenateâDemo
crats 27, Republicans 11. HouseâDemo
crats 55, Republicans 45; with chance of
58 to 42.
GAINS IN NEW YORK.
Republican Legislative Majority In-
creased by Twelve Members.
NEW York. Nov. B.â Returns received
from up the State increase the Republi
can Assembly membership to 93. against
57 Democrats, a Republican gain of 12.
In New York County the largest Tam
many plurality was that of the candidate
for surrogate, Abner C. Thomas, 55,670.
He was formerly a Henry George leader.
Ex-Justice Joseph F. Daly, fusion candi
date for Supreme Judge, who was ex
pected to get many Democratic votes, did
not head the poll for his ticket. The in
ndent labor vote, as indicated by the
vote for John S. Crosby for Supreme
i judge, was 6700, or 3000 less than the So
' cialist vote. The Tammany pluralities In
| the several counties are about normal,
the gains of Assemblymen In this city be
ing due largely to combinations with
Citizens' Union and Labor Union men
against Republican candidates.
Richard Croker to-day again expressed
his regret that the Democrats up the
State "had no organization," and although
he did not say so, it is inferred that Tam
many hopes to organize the whole State
! for the campaign of 1900. Mr. Croker
pointed to Nebraska as an illustration of
what energetic work will do, and declared
that the Democrats could carry New
York State in 1900.
Senator I'latt and Assemblyman Mazet
to-day denied interviews in which they
were credited with saying that Assembly
man Stewart's seat would surely be con
tested. They said that a contest would
! be adopted only In case convincing proof
of fraud were discovered.
LOUISVILLE. Nov. B.â Returns re
ceived by the Courier-Journal up to 1 : -;0
a. m. give Goebel a plurality of 2070 votes.
These figures are based on returns from
lOJfl out of 1863 precincts. Of the 72 miss
ing precincts 20 are In the Republican
] Eleventh District, 7 are In Republican
1 counties of the Tenth District and 31 aro
in Democratic counties of the Tenth Dls

MARYLAND ESTIMATES.
Factional Strife Responsible for the
Republican Reverse.
BALTIMORE, Nov. B.â Unofficial re
turns from Baltimore City and all the
counties of the State show that the Dem
ocrats swept practically everything be
fore them In yesterday's contest. John
Walter Smith, Dr. Joshua Herring and
isidor Raynor, their candidates for Gov
ernor. Comptroller and Attorney General,
respectively, were elected over the Re
publican candidates by approximately
11.300 majority. The oflicial count, it is
thought, will not materially change ihese
tigures.
i The Democrats elected eleven State Sen
ators for four-year terms, which, with
their four hold-overs, will give them tir
t^<-n out of v total membership of twenty
six in the upper house of the General As-
Bembljr. In the lower house, composed of
, ninety-one members, the Democrats elec't
i ed sixty-six, while the Republicans will
; have only twi:iity-five delegates in the
legislature to meet in January of next
year.
In Baltimore City the Democrats elected
a Judge of the Court of Appeals, Clerk of
I the City Court, Sheriff. State Attorney,
ray Surveyor and three Judges of the
Orphans' Court. The plurality In Balti
more City of all the Democratic candi
dates runs close up to those of the leaden
on the ticket, while in the counties local
prejudices cut down the majorities of the
successful candidates for local offices.
Many theories nave been advanced a*
to the cause of the Democratic landslide,
but a careful analysis shows that the
Democratic independent voter supported
Colonel Smith, while many disgruntled
Republicans either remained away from
the polls or cast their ballot for the Dem
ocratic candidates.
A special election in the First Congre*
sional District will be made necessary by
the success of Colonel Smith as a candi
date for Governor.
BRYAN'S NEBRASKA VICTORY.
Fusion Majority Will Be at Least
Twelve Thousand.
LINCOLN, Nehr., Nov. S.â Complete re
turns coming in to-night do not materially
change the early estimates of the result
of yesterday's election. The fusionista
carry the State by 12,000. perhaps more,
on the face of returns from nearly half
the counties. They elected William
Neville to Congress over Moses P. Kln
kaid in the Sixth District, but by a re
duced maioriiy, and gain slightly in judi
cial districts. Chairman Edmiston of tho
Fusion State Central Committee insists
that S. A. Holcomb is elected Judge of
the Supreme Court by 15.000, probably
more The Republican Committee gave
up the fight and quit counting early this
morning.
\V J Bryan said he had nothing fur
ther to add to his comment of last night
that the fusion victory in Nebraska was a
rebuke to the national administration. He
refused to discuss the result in other
States. Mr. Bryan received many tele
grams of congratulations from all parts
of the United States.
There was an Informal jollification
meeting in the Populists' State hendquar
ters this afternoon. Chairman Edmiston
was kept busy at the long-distance tele
phone receiving returns and answering
inquiries. The fusionists are arranging
for a State ratification at the Capitol
grounds Frldav night.
MASSACHUSETTS COMPLETE.
Democrats Make a Slight Gain in the
Legislature.
BOSTON. Nov. B.â While the entire Re
publican State ticket was elected yester
day the Democrats are jubilant over the
party victory In Boston. The figures for
the State are: Crane (Ft.). 165.576; Paine
(D.)i 103.514: Republican plurality, 6.1.062.
The plurality or Governor Woleott over
Candidate Bruce last year was 83.136.
In the Senate th< Democrats have nine
members, a gain of two. which means the
ability to demand a roll call, a parlia
mentary advantage no 1 within Democrat
ic means for some years. The Senate will
stand: Republicans, 31: Democrats. 9.
The House will stand: Republicans, 166;
Democrat Ã, 70: Socialist Democrats, 2; In
dependents. - The Republicans have lost
one Representative and the Democrats
have made a net gain of four, while the
Socialists hold their own.
IOWA BREAKS A RECORD.
Republican Majority on Governor
Largest in the State's History.
T'!".S MOINES, Nov. S. -Returns from
ninety <>f the ninety-nine counties of the
State, with estimates on the others, show
that the Republican claim of 60,000 plural
ity for Governor Shaw is easily main
tained. His majority over all candidates
for Governor la estimated at 48,000, which
Is tho largest in the history of the State
on the gubernatorial vote. Based on the
vote of IS:<S, the vote this year shows a
Republican increase of about 3 per cent
ami 10 per cent for the Democrats, which
makes the entire Republican vote in th<?
neighborhood of 230,000 and the total Dem
ocratic vote 190,000. But this is a falling
off from the vote of 1597 of about 6 and 10 I
per cent, respectively.
The Legislature will stand: Senate, 35
Republicans and 15 Democrats; the House,
83 Republicans and 17 Democrats, a gain
of seventeen votes on joint ballot for the
Republicans. P.oth the Gear and the
Cummins forces claim a majority of the
Republican votes for the United States !

WANTED HOBART TO VOTE.
Election Officials Were Willing to
Move the Polls to His House.
PATERSON, N. J.. Nov. S.â Vice Presi
dent Hobart lives in the Third District,
Fourth Ward. For years It has been his
custom to tender to the judges and clerks
and those Interested immediately in the
election, a dinner at the noon hour. Yes
terday when the judges, clerks and
watchers learned that the Vice President
had expressed ;i wish to cast a ballot as
usual, it was suggested that for a brief
period of time theymight remov the poll
ing place to the Hobart residence. The
election officials, both Democratic and
Republican, were perfectly willing to
adopt the suggestion, but it was found
upon investigation that an arrangement
of this sort would be illegal, and that the
entire election in this particular precinct
might be Invalidated. Consequently It
was regretfully abandoned.
SOUTH DAKOTA RETURNS.
Pickerel State Back in the Republican

ST. PAT'I.. Minn., Nov. S.-A Sioux Falls
(S. D.) special to the Pioneer Press says:
Additional reports received this evening
from points in the State make but little
change in the Republican majority. In
creasing it from 3SS4 to 4075. Part of this
increase is shown in Bonhomme County,
where the early estimates gave the Re
publican nominees 167 majority. Ten pre
cincts in that county increase this to .'?2t>,
and the county complete will show a still
further increase. The fusionists carried
I'nion County by 106 majority. Julian
Bennett, fusion candidate for the State
bench, carried his judicial district, nomi
nally Republican, by about 900 majority,
a testimonial to his personal popularity.

TEXT OP DEMANDS MADE TO

United States Wants Written Pledges
That Chinese Ports Shall Be
Kept Open to American
Commerce.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 8.-Offlcials here
are at a loas to know what was meant by
the mysterious London dispatch relating
to Anglo-American Chinese relations of
such a startling character that the news
could not be published. It is stated that
there is nothing in this line at present
between Great Britain and the United
States that can be said to be of a sensa
tional character. The Government is not
averse to having it known broadly that
it has been steadily engaged in negotia
tions for months looking to the mainten
ance of whatever trade rights we now en
joy in Chinese ports. Officials do not care
to go into details while the negotiations
are still in progress, but it is expected
the subject will be made the basis of a
special message to Congress by the Presi
dent. It Is said our Government is not
likely to encounter any serious opposition
to what it regards as its perfectly reason
able effort to .secure from the i-Juropean
powers interested formal assurances in
contirmation of verbal statements already
made that the way for American trade in
China will be kept open in the event of a
retention of the existing conditions and I
leaseholds. Nothing has been heard from i
France on this subject as yet, though it
is assumed that the returning Embassa
dor, Al. t'ambon, will bear some instruc
tions on the subject.
The Chinese Government, through Min
ister Wu Ting Fang, is keeping a watch
ful eye on the recent developments relat
ing to China. Within the last few days
he saw Secretary Hay, with a view to
learning to what extent the United States
had acted. The response of the Secretary
of State is said to have been uuite full
and frank and to the effect that, at the
request of the President, our Embassadors
and Ministers abroad had been asked to
secure deiinite assurances that there
should be no interruption to the access
of American trade and commerce to the
interior of China through the treaty ports.
Such assurances had been given from
time to time In a somewhat informal
manner as parts of the manifestos by
which foreign nowers assumed control of
ports on the China coast, but the purpose
of this request was to have the assur
ances take definite, tangible written form,
so .is to leave no room for doubt that the
future commerce in the Orient would meet
no unforeseen embarrassment.
It can be statod positively that the re- i
cent move of the United States was not
the result of an understanding or agree
ment with the Chinese Minister, and, so
far as Is known here, the Chinese authori
ties were not consulted. Whether it
would be regarded favorably by China de
pends, in the judgment of Minister Wu,
on subsequent developments.
Throughout diplomatic circles keen in
terest is manifested in the American move
and in the replies which are likely to be
elicited from the American inquiry
abroad. The view prevails that while
there will be no difficulty in securing gen
eral assurances of a favorable character
it Is not so certain that a definite state
ment in writing or tangible form will be
given.
Those best acquainted with the subject
hold that Great Britain, Germany and
Russia will coincide with the American
view and that if any objection comes it is
likely to arise in France, as the French
policy in Madagascar and Cochin China
Is to give preferential rates to French
goods and make discriminations against
foreign goods. From this it is implied
that France will not give a written as
surance that American commerce will be
on equal terms in those parts of China
where French spheres of influence prevail.
PACIFIC IMPROVEMENT
COMPANY TO DISSOLVE
NEW TORK, Nov. B.â lt was understood
in Wall street to-day that the ultimate
result of meetings which have been held
during the past few days between C. P.
Huntlngton, Mrs. Leland Stanford,
George Crocker and Thomas H. Hub
bard who represents the. Mark Hop
kins-'Searles interests in the Southern Pa
cific Company, will be the winding up of
the Pacific Improvement Company.
The four interests named own this
company, which is capitalized at $10,000,
--000 and "was organized twenty years ago
as a general contracting company. It
owns railway securities and various im
provements along the line of tire Southern
Pacific Railway, including the Hotel del
Monte at Monterey. An adjustment of
accounts with the Southern Pacific Com
pany is now in progress and when it is
wound up the four proprietary interests
will get their respective share of tho
assets The process of winding up. how
ever. Is likely to cover a considerable
period.

NEW ADVERTISEMENTS.
No Effect Without a Cause.
This Is true, yet for many ages no
one could account for the mysterious
and excruciating pains that, seemingly
without sufficient cause, tortured the
hapless sufferer, and oftentimes twist-
ed his limbs out of all semblance to
humanity.
Science, . however, has at length
solved this problem, and has proclaimed
that rheumatism, in all its varied
phases, is due to uric acid in the blood.
Hence, when one is afflicted with
rheumatism he knows there is too much
acid in his blood.
How does this happen. It must be
the blood's purifiers, the liver, and es-
pecially the kidneys, are out of order
and do not properly perform their
functions.
But how can they be restored to their
normal healthy state? Hundreds of
thousands of grateful and now healthy
people will indorse the answer:
Use Warner's Safe Cure, which will
check an excess of acid, dissolve the
acid deposit and produce a normal and
healthy condition of the kidneys and
liver, and then, the cause being re-
i moved, the rheumatism will quickly
disappear.

LAST MONTH
OF LEAGUE
BASEBALL
Series of Games Between
Champions and Eastern
League Players.
The league race is practically ended
and the Statesmen of Sacramento are on
top. For three months no other team in
the league has occupied first place, al
though San Francisco was within striking
distance all of the time. It is all over
now, and the Senators will be elected to
meet the California team, made up of
Eastern' league players.
Since the rejuvenation of the Oakland
team, two months ago that aggregation of
ball tossers has exhibited itself in a vic
torious light. At that time they were
tallenders with a vengeance, but game
â  after game advanced them peg by peg
until there was a tie In percentage be
tween Oakland and Santa Cruz. A week
ago last Saturday the Oakland nine be
came, sullen and surrendered a match to
Sacramento, and the very next day lost
the second game. This resulted in clinch
ing the championship for Sacramento and
dropping Oakland Into the fourth place.
San Francisco will end the season in
second place, but the third may be oc
cupied either by Oakland or Santa Cruz.
Both these teams are hot in the race to
escape the tall end degradation and will
light hard to secure even the third posi
tion in the column.
Oakland and Santa Cruz will play In
this city on Saturday and Sunday. San
Francisco meeting Sacramento at Sacra
mento. As the tight Is now paired be
tween these two sets of teams, there
should be some close baseball.
The standing of the teams at present is:

BEN LEDI
IN FRONT
AT 40 TO
The Ring Scorched Over the
Outsider's Win â Song
er's Splendid Work.
The betting ring at Tanforan Park
Juggled the hottest live one of the sea
son yesterday. The landslide came in the
last event, which, owing to a lack of
entries, did not appear on the overnight
cards. It filled Â»4 the track yesterday
morning and among those enteredâ it was
a five-furlong scrambleâ was Ben Ledi, a
Montana-bred fllly. While the bookies
were busily engaged in "bumping" the
two choicesâ Qenua and Montallade they
found themselves gradually compelled to
cut the odds against Ben Ledi from â Â»â '
down to 8, owing to the busy play on the
outsider. Songer tossed the leg over the
good thing and breaking away third was
quickly in front cutting out a heart
breaking clip. He won at the wire by a
couple of lengths from Montallade, on
which Tommy Burns rode his prettiest.
Genua, the real favorite, was downed a
head for the show by Monda, Nearly
every book quit loser to the race.
The ileuis were again small and the
crowd below the average In point of at
tendance. No doubt this latter fact could
be ascribed to the inclemency of the
weather, rain falling at Intervals through
out the afternoon. Favorites won just
half of the races on the card. Songer dis
tinguished himself in the saddle by plac
ing four winners over the plate In front
and is rapidly becoming a general favor
ite. ,
The opening six-furlong run was only
a gallop for the Corrigan entry, St. Cas
simir, a4to B choice. The youngster wan
asked to beat nothing and won galloping
from Choteau. Burns on Silver Tail could
do no better than beat Waterwick lor the
j Wyoming, a 1 to 2 favorite for the
seven-furlong selling affair which fol
lowed, hau a very close calL Burns
shook Btromo up in the stretch with such
surprising suits that the second choice
was beaten but a nose. The winner is
plainly not at his best and the price laid
was a very short one when his preceding
race was taken Into consideration. Coda,
away poorly, finished a good third.
P. "Ryan seems to win about every time
he stars at the new track. His Marcato
was the tip for the third recital, and
backed from 2 to 6 to 5 the brown gelding
won away off from Whitcomb. Batista
showed some early speed, but blew up
early, eventually hanging on long enough
to get the show.
Tommy Burns had the mount on Dr.
Bernays in the mile run. the chestnut be
ing hammered down from even money to
7 to 10. In his memoirs Burns can explain
why he pulled up after getting away in
front lie did and Zoroaster led all the
way, beating the Doctor half a length.
Alaria; poorly handled by Fauntleroy, ran
a close third. â 
Midity ruled favorite for the mile purse
run and left her speed behind her. Top
mast, at odds of 5 to 1 trailed the other
three starters to the stretch, where Son
ger called on him, and the Shields entry
won galloping. Olinthus, a 15 to l shot,
reached the wire a neck before Malay.

THE MERRY MONARCH
RULES AT THE GRAND
Judging from the laujrhter and applause
prevalent at the Grand Opera-house this
week "El Capitan" scorns to have found
a rival In 'â The Merry Monarch." for
there Is no denying the fact that tho suc
cess of this clever comic opera is as great
as that of Sousa's popular work. There
pedally two reasons for this iUO-
Primarily William Woolf in the title
role has a part which fits him like, a glove
and in which he has suflicimt opportunity
to sh iw his strength as a comedian. He
â¢ veral Bcenes to himself, the humor
of which are very conducive to his ten
dencj to resort to the coarser class of
v work. It is this very tendency
which makes him so popular with the the
ater-going public, and by means of which
he has established for himself a reputa
tion which no one can take away from I
Kirn. Mr. Woolf s popularity has reached
a very high point, from which he may
look down defiantly upon any who has
â  fortunate desire to dispute him this
honor. As tho Merry Monarch he does
certainly some clever work which should
be appreciated according? to its merits.
The' other Rrent feature of this per
formance Is the mounting and stage man
agement. The scenery and costumes are
superb and Mr. Jones, always on the alert
for snappy productions, was careful to
keep the < horus alive, so that the stage
presents at every moment a bright pic
ture .if brisk action. Edith Mason has
an opportunity to look her bent and sing
a few very pretty solos in her usual flaw
manfier. Arthur Wboley, Winfred
i ;,,;â¢â . Bâ le Fairbalrn and Hattie Belle
Lnrid contribute their phare toward the
excellence of this production. Sousa's or
chestration lends much color to this play.
ALFRED METZOER.
This afternoon at a special matinee at
the California Theater Nance o'Ncll will
play the "Jewess." To-night she repeats
"Lady Teazle," to-morrow night she will
be ' Magda," Saturday matinee "The

and Saturday night she will bid farewell
to San Francisco as "Camille." Sunday
night the well-known comedian, Harry
c,,r>>>n Clarke, will begin a week's en
gagement in "What Happened to Jones."
Major Mite, the llliputian comedian, Ad
nd her lions and a lot of clever
vaudeville people are crowding the Chutes
ter every afternoon and evening. To
iiiKlit the feature of the amateur show
will be a megaphone minstrel perform

FINED FOR CONTEMPT.
E. H. Baxter Violated an Injunction
and Must Pay Two Hundred
Dollars.
It costs money to disregard an Injunc
tion of a Federal Court. E. 11. Baxter
ot ::l Second Btreet was apprised ye-ster
day of that fact with a dull thud.
Mr. liaxtor sells among other things
phenacetine packed In a certain way.
Suit was brought against him by a. per
son who alleged that ho alone was en
titled to sell phenacetine under that par
ticular label and ii; that particular way.
Pending the trial. United States Circuit
Jnd;,'c Morrow ipsued a preliminary In
junction -warning Baxter not to continue
selling the stuff. Haxter passed by the
injunction as the Idl*- wind which cometh
winner- no man knoweth and which
bloweth smoke whither no man goeth.
He was up before the Judge yesterday
for contempt of court.
"ThÂ« dignity of the court must be up
held and its processes must be obeyed."
said Judge MOITOW.
Kuxu-r agreed that the remark of the
court was accurate, when he was in
formed that he must pay a fine of $200
or suffer an imprisonment of sixty days.
He was allowed three days in which to
pay the fine.
Boxing Kangaroo Dead.
The Zoo at the Chutes Is ngnin i n
mourning. Late last night the "old man"
kangaroo from Australia, the only one of
the kind In captivity In America, died
after a brief but severe illness. All the
aid that medical skill could give the an
tipodean was extended, but to no avail.
He was described at length In The Call
laÂ«=t July, was rapidly learning to box
and was highly valued.
"NERVES" SHOULD BE
CALLED "HYSTERICS"
"Nerves" 1b far from bring: a poor farce,
oven though its climaxes are those of
long ago generations. The only novelty
that the public Insists upon in a farce is
of character drawing and color, and that
"Nerves" has to a considerable extent.
The Alcazar company Is not treating it
fairly. â¢
There Is a shrieking state of affairs on
the stago that emphasizes neither the fun
nor the "nerves." The hysterical condi
tion Miss Foster attempts to suggest by
fumblln"- at hairpins or clasping tense
fingers. The other supposedly nervous
people burlesque the condition so broadly
that Miss Foster's more appreciative work
is discouraged and lost sight of.
If somebndv had stood over the re
hearsals and uttered one prolonged
"hush," matters might be better.

The Columbia makes announcement of
five stars hooked for the present season.
They axe Nat Goodwin. De Wolf Hoppi-r.
Denman Thompson, Sol Smith Russell
and Julia Marlowe.
The long Mr. Hopper has been to lyon
don and found a new wife since last we
saw htm. Both facts lend interest to his
personality. The wife is the Nella Ber
gen who sang here in "El Capttan" and
made a record for coming down from her
high notes like the fall of a feather.
London was very doubtful about both
Mr. Hopper and Mr. Goodwin at first, but
I/onrlon warmed at last. Goodwin was
unfortunate in opening with a play of
Clyde Fitch's, which. Judging from report.
Is one of the bad Ideas which Mr. Fitch
does not hesitate to offer the public when
a good Idea is coy. He has been clever
in spasms, but he Js never to be relied
upon.
Miss Marlowe will probably come to ua
as "Barbara Freitehie." In which the
hasty Clyde seems to have spoiled good
material again. However, the star can
keep any kind of a play alive in New
York, provided she Is accorded most of
center Rtage. SARAH COMSTOCK.
STOCKHOLDERS ARE LIABLE
An Interesting Decision of the Su-
preme Court in a Case of Un
paid for Shares.
Dort-th Walter sued the Merced Acad
emy Association, a corporation, in a fore
closure action, and after the sale of tho
premises Involved a deficiency judgment
was entered against the defendant cor
poration for $5!">S7 2.'>. Action was then
prosecuted against a dozen or more stock
holders to ascertain the amount due from
each on the deficiency judgment, as own
ers and holders of the stock of the con
cern, and to obtain judgment and execu
tion from eacb>
Judgment went to the plaintiff and an
npp<nl was taken, the appellants declar
ing that they were not liable by reason
of the variance ih the purposes of ln
corporatlon as set forth in the subscrip
tion agreement and as disclosed in the
articles of incorporation. The evidence
showed that $33 .33 1-3 per share and no
more had been paid on their stock, and
that HK6B 2-4 was still due from tho
shareholders. The decision of the Su
preme Court is that the stockholders are
Individually liable and Judgment was af

MOUNT IDA
A WINNER AT
UNION PARK
Defeats Signal Handily in the
Regular Midweek Cours
ing Stake.
Mount Ida, representing the kennels of
Lande & Gerber, easily accounted for the
midweek stake at Union Coursing Park
yesterday. The llnal between Mount Ida
and the white dog Signal was run almost
in the dark, the former winning by a
score of -32 points to 6. Three undecided
courses near the end of the day's card
delayed the sport and . nearly prevented
the running of the linal because of dark
ness. Matchless and Ballroom Belle ran
an undecided, and at the next attempt
they ran all over the field unsighted. In
the decisive course, in which a relief dog
was cent to their assistance, Matchless
won by a score of 17 to 5. This spoiled â 
any chance Matchless may have had for
the stake and he was withdrawn. This i
did away with his course in the next
round with Signal, and also did away with
the necessity of Mount Ida running a bye
course. Mount Ida and Signal then ran
the final in the rapidly garnering gloom.
The hare proved a strong one, taking the
dogs across the field, where it made good
Its escape.
The bettors who picked dogs other than
the favorites were generally fortunate.
The hares were of unequal quality and a
number of flukey courses resulted, in
which the favorites lost. A Montana dog,
Corin's Flashlight, ran for the first time,
but made a poor showing. Trailer beat
Nancy R in the run-down after a long
course. In the next round Trailer did not
try to approach the hare, being still suf- .
fering apparently from her exertions. The ;
results in detail, with the official score of
points, follow: .

McKEEVER
OUTFOUGHT
BY SMITH
Decision Given to the "Mys
terious" at the End of
the Bout.
Spivial Pispatch to The Call.
NEW FORK, Nov. B.â "Mysterious"
Billy Smith defeated Charley McKeever
of Philadelphia In a twenty-round bout
at catrh weights at the Broadway Ath
letlc Club to-night Smith weighed l ir,
pounds and his opponent tipped th>^ s<-airs
at about the Fame weight. Both men
were In prime condition and the flght
was fast and Interesting from start to
finish.
McKeever used his left t.> k""<1 advant
age in tin- opening rounds, sending
Btralght Jabs to the face and neck, and
was equally us clever at close quarters as
Smith. McKeever put a straight left on
the mouth in the eleventh and drew fir.--!
blood by cutting Smith's eye with another
left jab. Smith replied with a similar
blow, which raised a lump over Mc-
KeeVer's iÂ«-f t eye.
From this point Smith, who had had the
worst of It, began to improve. McKeever
cani.' out of a mix-up in the sixteenth
nimid with a cut iind'-r his right eye.
McKeever jabbed his left on the jaw, but
had the wor.it of the hard in- fighting
which followed.
In the nint teenth round thrre was some
vicious work on both sides, and in a half
clinch Smith threw McKeever from him,
the Philadelphia man going to the floor,
where he remained nine seconds on one
knee. Many persons cried "Foul" on ac
count of Smith's work, but the referee
paid no attention to them.
In the final round Smith was very ag
gressive and hit his opponent frequently,
and the referee declared Smith the Win
ner.
Smith was the favorite, odds of 100 to
50 and 100 to 80 being asked on his
chances,
Tom Sh.irkey was introduced after the
second preliminary, and in response to
calls for a speech said:
"I will Wave it to the men vho w.'re
down at Coney Island last Friday ni^ht
and also to the general publli , w:
George Slier gave roe a fair decision or
not. It is now up to Jeffries to 'neet me
again. J am ready at any timeâ say two,

Jury Disbelieves the Evidence of a
Detective Against the Accused
Bank Clerk.
MINNEAPOLIS, Minn., Nov. B.â A
i eiul to the Times from Winnipeg, Mani
toba, says: .After being eight da.
trial the case against John W. An
1 fur the theft of $62,000 from Molson'a
Bank in 1897 went to the jury ai ll;25 thia
' morning. Judge Bain addressed the jury
i an hour and a quarter, going over every
detail in the casi and referring to the
character of Detective Davis, who, it ia
said, was noi a professional detective, buc
a private individual operating for a re
ward. The point was whether his evi
-Id< nee was Bufflcieotly Lorroborated. 'o
I satisfy the Jury.
i The jury returned in an hour and a halt
with a verdict of not guilty, and the
tators cheered, again and again in spite
' of the efforts of the Sheriff and his offl
cers to restore ,orcler. Th<> prla
frit nds crowded around the box to shake
; his hand, and he had a triumphant march
; out of the courthouse, with more cheer
ing.
A remarkable scene in a Canadian
- courthouse and a notable thing was the
in i. ~ei.ee of a large number
j Anderson was greeted with applause when
! he appeared on th" Btr< ets, and in th.>
i evening a procession was formed and
marched to the Roblin House, where a
banquet and reception was hold. Ander
son's mother, brothers and employer since

; the congratulation? to Anderson. It is
ireported that Anderson's friends will en
j ter suit against Davis for damages.
Young Anderson was employed by the
I bank months after the robbery and
! not arrested until about six months
! after the stolen treasure had been dua- up
in the outskirts of Winnipeg. The case
! against him was worked up by a Chicago
j detective named Davis.

Good Coast Defenses.
PORTLAND, Or., Nov. B.â Major Oen
eral Nelson A. Miles left for San Fran-
Ctsco this morning. Speaking of the forti
fications at the mouth of the Columbia
he said: "The expen.se of ilu Government
fortifications at the Columbia is fully
justified. They protect one of the
harbors in the world. The river channel
is from 2."> to 30 feet deep and the Govern
ment no doubt will make it 40 feet deep.
It will pay to do so. The same thing I
have said regarding the Columbia River
fortification* applies to the improvements
on Puget Sound."

THREE MEN NEARLY LOSE
THEIR LIVES IN THE BAY
I 0 rp HREE men nearly lost their lives by drowning yesterday in the bay. Â©
| 5 I Two made deliberate attempts at suicide and the third, a German sailor, â¦
j + I was trying to escape from the gunboat Geier. â¢?
j*Â£ I 11. Kroenhart, the sailor, had a marvelous escape. He was four- Â£
j am teen hours in the water and was nearly dead when picked up by the +
\ river steamer Dauntless. Nearly two weeks ago Kroenhart robbed a Â£â¢
I i* shipmate of $8 and made his escape to the shore. He was captured in a 4-
I -â¼â  saloon on Geary street and taken back to the gunboat. There he was put *?
j 88 in irons to await the return of the Geier to Germany, where he would be Â£
i court-martialed and punished. V
V By some means or other Kroenhart got out of his irons last Monday Jl
I ?m afternoon. He waited until it was dark and then, seizing a lifebuoy, slipped +
+ overboard. The tide was running out at the time and the sailor could make 55
55 no headway against it. He was carried down past Alcatraz and nearly out 4
-- to sea before the tide turned. Then the current carried him up along the 23
28 Marin shore through Raccoon straits and about 6 a. m. yesterday he was â¦
â¦ in almost slack water off Sheep Island. 85
I V The steamer Dauntless was on her way from Stockton to San Francisco gÂ»
I Â£â¢ and Captain Goodale caught sight of the man and the lifebuoy. He at once +
j+' stopped his vessel and lowering a boat picked Kroenhart up. The sailor 28
jBB was completely exhausted and more dead than alive. Everything possible 4
"â¦" was done for him, and as soon as the steamer docked he was hurried to the â¦*
r * Harbor Receiving Hospital, where Dr. Cherry attended to him. â¢*
*Â£ As soon as he could be moved Kroenhart was taken in charge by the *.
gg German Consul and put aboard the Geier. The vessel was to have sailed at *+
; â¦ 2 p. m., but owing to the thick weather outside remained in port until to- $%
& day. Kroenhart may be a prisoner aboard the ship for a year, or until the â¦
4 Geier returns to Germany, unless another man-of-war homeward bound â¢*
iâ¦? should be spoken. *
â¦ Charles Martin, a clerk in the United States army quartermaster's de- * 3
â¢* partment, made two attempts during the afternoon to drown himself at *
* Meiggs wharf. Martin's wife died a short time ago and he has been de- *Â°
â¢* Bpondent ever since. The first time he jumped over he was picked up by the *.
Z> crew of the revenue cutter Hartley and put ashore. Instead of going home V
V as he promised he went behind the Merchants' Exchange house and jumped Z,
o# In again. This time he was rescued by Jim Farley and Tom Crowley and ?
+ sent to the Receiving Hospital. *
.* P. F. Murrey, who lives at 11 Glover street, jumped off Mission street *+
â¦ wharf and was rescued by some bystanders. He was taken to the Harbor 1%
I** Hospital, where Dr. Morrison soon had him as well as ever. Murrey has â¦
* been drinking and is of the impression that his family has been murdered 88
â¢5 and that some one Is after him to take his life. â¦

WATER IS CITED

in Point.
CONVENTION CLOSE AT HAND
. â Â«
GOVERNMENT'S LIMITATIONS
ARE EXPLAINED.
â¦
Stress Placed Upon California's Sole
Control of Its Water Supply So
That Complications May
Be Avoided.
President Thomas of the California As
sociation for the Storage of Flood Waters
calls attention to the action of the State j
of Massachusetts in the matter of pro
viding a water supply for Greater Bos- j
ton as Illustrative of what is considered !
prudent In i ne of the oldest and most
conservative States in the Union and as I
having a bearing upon the arguments that
may be made at the State convention
next week in reference to the action of j
California toward the Impounding of flood j
xvaiers for irrigating. An ao'ount of tlvj
action of Massachusetts appeared in a
recent number of Harper's Magazine. In !
view of the warm discussion which Los j
Angeles is carrying on concerning a bond |
issue by the State of California to pro- |
vide restraining dams, the following ex- i
tract from the article In question is i
given:
The demand had equaled the maximum
capacities of these suppli'-'^. and new
eources were remote. Only by co-operation i
could the proper new â otlTCefl b* .'-â¢cure'!.
The State, therefore, again came forward
as agent for the associated municipalities.
â \Vlth extraordinary celerity an abundant
supply of exceptionally pure and soft water
was introduced from the Nashua River,
where, on the site of one of the largest im- I
pounding reservoirs in the world, a large
manufacturing village had to be wiped out
of existence. The new system is so planned
as to admit of indefinite extension, to in
clude river after river when needed, and
answer every demand of a population ot
many millions.
Mr. Thomas thinks that the attendance j
at the convention next week will be large. â 
He hopes that harmony will be reached I
through the committee on resolutions.
"1 have been told," he said yesterday,
"that a dam five feet high across the â 
mouth of Clear Lake would hold all the
drainage of the watershed and would i
provide power sufficient to move all the
wheels in Oakland; also that the cost of j
I building the dam would, not exceed the ;
| cost of the damage done by the flood
I waters of the lake in one year. What
i has the Government to do, for instance,
! with damming Clear Lake? Nothing, of
course.
"If the Government should build storage
reservoirs, they could be only to further
navigation, holding bÃck the floods and
releasing the water when the rivers are
! at low ebb, for the Government's rights
I are confined to the matter of navigation.
i How would It help us, as lrrigatnrs, to
have the water impounded solely to raise
the river when necessary?
"The really active opposition to the
i proposed action of the State In its own
, behalf comes from the national irrigat
! ors. Their arguments are based upon the
report of Chittenden. The fact he
brought out that the water supplies in
all the arid regions of the ("nited States
I with the exception of the Pacific Coast
j are complicatedâ no arid States except
I those indicated having an entirely inde
! pendent water supply â is ignored in the
; arguments now made against the State
'â  plan. California has all her water supply
i within her own borders, and can act with
| out any fear of complications with her
neighbors or the Government.
AWAITING THE INDIANA.
Tennessee Delegation Here to Bid
Its Brave Welcome Home.
The Tennessee delegation, which has
come to welcome the volunteers return
ing on the transport Indiana, arrived In
the city yesterday, forty strong, and is j
now quartered at the Occidental Hotel j
waiting for thf tinkling of the telephone j
I bell which shall cail them to receive the j
news of the arrival of the troops who are i
now expected at any hour.
When the boys arrive the friends who
i are now awaiting them will follow the
established precedent, go out and meet j
them in the tug Markham, take them !
hampers filled with things to please their :
palates, so long accustomed to rice and j
coffee, tend to the sick ones among them
and try to make the time of their deten
tion pass as comfortably and pleasantly
as possible until they are mustered out !
and sent home.
In Nashville a grand reception has been !
arranged, at which the troops will be re- \
| viewed by President McKinley, General j
Corbln, Fitzhugh Lee, Admiral Schley j
and a host of other notables.
The volunteers will be presented with
medals commemorative of the patriotism
and valor they have displayed, the money
for which has been raised by the Wo
man's Comfort Circle of Tennessee, to
| which patriotic organization nearly every i
; mother, sister, daughter and wife in the j

MEDICAL AUTHORITIES.

CIATION.

Field of Therapeutics, and Refer 3
Slightingly to Its Enemies.
New York Sun, Oct. 25.
The New York State Medical Associa-
tion began its sixteenth annual meeting
at the Academy of Medicine yesterday.
Physicians from all parts of the State
were present. Dr. Thomas J. Hill of
this city stirred up some discussion by
a paper on alcohol. Alcohol, he said, was
of many kinds. As an ingredient In alco-
holic drinks it is not necessarily harmful.
New whiskey he denounced as unlit for
use.
It is the quality of the alcoholic product,
not its quantity, that should be con-
demned.
Dr. Hillis put alcohol first among gen-
eral stimulants and heart tonics, and said
that it was an excellent food in many
cases where other foods could not be re-
tained. He then paid his respects to the
temperance people in the following man-
ner:
"The man is 'justified who, feeling in-
secure, puts up a lightning rod to pro-
tect his house; so is the man who cannot
handle alcohol in a rational manner
equally justified in taking a pledge and
attaching himself to a temperance soci-
ety. There he will have an opportunity
with the others to put himself on exhibi-
tion as a weakling and a person without
moral strength or resolution, but he has
no right to denounce alcohol because of
his weakness any more than he should
a lamppost which he was- unfortunate
enough to run foul of when under the in-
fluence of his potation. The physician
above all men must not be frightened
away from his obligation to his patient
by the noise and clamor made, by the
clergyman or the temperance orator, the
former of whom may know nothing of
alcohol; the latter too much. It is diffi-
cult to contemplate without pity the posi-
tion of these poor men, conscripts from
the medical profession and others assem-
bled in the moral blockhouse, unconscious
that no war exists, but who are fighting
for principles that have been conceded,
and deaf to the bugle blast of common
sense which demands reconciliation and
reunion as a common benefit to all.
"Alcohol is a form of food already di-
gested.
. "It has a place on the sideboard and It
must have a place in the sick room until
we discover another agent more efficient
and able to supplant it by virtue of its
availability and physiological* action. No
such agent, however, has yet been dis-
covered, the opinions of others to the con-
trary notwithstanding."
Duffy's Pure Malt Whiskey is the purest
alcoholic stimulant known to the medical
profession. No sick room or hospital
should be without it. Over 7000 doctors,
who believe as Dr. Hillis does, prescribe
and recommend it; it is also used in nearly
every prominent hospital exclusively.
Write for our interesting book of infor-
mation. We will send you a copy free for
the asking. Duffy Malt Whiskey Company,

NOW that the eld I over and the politi
. the year have been settled, the
iple yi the Pacific Coast would better return
issue on which ail are or ought to be
that of procuring the appointment of a rep-
I tst to the vacancy on the Inter
state Commerce Commission.
It is to Jjc retted that two candidates for the
office have â¢ en put forward from the coast, but the
regret is not one which should cause much, if any,
hesitation. The choice between the two is not difh
cult to make. General Chipman has been nominated
as the candidate of Mr. Stubbs of the Southern Pa
cific; W. K. Wheeler has been nominated by a con
ference of the Pacific Coast Jobbers' and Manufac
turers' Association, at which there were representa
tives of every important city of the three States, Cali
fornia, Oregon and Washington. The first candidate
has been indorsed by his personal friends and by such
persons as are subject to the pull of Mr. Stubbs. The
second has received the indorsement and support of
every commercial and industrial organization of note
on the coast.
Arc we to have on the Interstate Commerce Com
mission the representative of the railroad or the rep
resentative of the business interests of all tlie people
of Washington, Oregon and California?
It is to be noted in the first place that the coast
is entitled to a representative on the commission.
Commercially and industrially the Union is divided
into five great divisions â the New England States,
the Middle States ... seaboard, the. Mis
sissippi Valley States, the Southern States, and the
Pacific States. There are five members of the com
mission. It was the intention of the framers of the
act by which the commission was created that each
of the great divisions of the Union should have a
representative upon it. New England, the Middle
States, the South and the Mississippi Valley have al
ways had representatives on the commission. The
Pacific Coast has never had one. It is an open se
cret that Southern Pacific influence has prevented
the coast from having a representative Commissioner
in the past, and is now determined either to have its
own man or none at all.
The representative business men of Washington,
Oregon and California have at last united to make the
fight for the * â  They have nominated for the
office a man who for years has made a study of inter
state commercial questions, and who i- recognized
as an established authority on all points involved in
such questions. Whether the issues raised be of law
or of fact, of precedent or of principle, he understands
them, and it is a foregone conclusion he would not
be on the commission long before he would be
looked to for counsel and judgment not only on
Pacific Coast matters but upon all questions that
arise.
It is to be noted, moreover, that there ought to be
upon the commission not only a Pacific Coast repre
sentative but a man versed in the affairs of business.
Most of the issues the commission is called upon to
solve an those of practical business as affected by
transportation rates rather than of technical law. As
a member of the commission Mr. Wheeler would be
a representative of the business men of the country
a? we as of our coast interests, and In a double re
spect, therefore, would be exactly the right man in
the right place.

It is true that i -ease of subscriptions
i= due to the ] the State, to the

the demand for i -. but when ample allow
ance is made for the subscriptions due to such causes
there remains a vast increase which can be accounted
for up< â  er ground than that of the popular
appreciation of the able series of papers of an educa

So prompt a response on the part of the public to

ligence of the community. The widespread favor with
which they have been received is therefore an evi
dence that among the people of California there are
thousands who know the full worth of the highest
culture and who liberally support every effort to at
tain it.
New subscriptions come in every day and arc daily
counted by t!:e hundreds. They are received from
part of tin- State. This is a proof that the bet
ter the studies ;ire understood the more they are
approved. As the scries goes on the circle of readers
widens, and each new reader is a new advocate com
mending rind approving the course. Thus the circula
tion of The CaH augments with a surprising rapidity
both in the city and in the country, and that, too,
among the best class of readers.
THE REPUBLICAN OUTLOOK.
REPUBLICAN stalwarts in San Francisco have
no reason to be downcast over the condition of
the party or the prospect of the great Presi
dential campaign that is coming. On the contrary,
there is much that is encouraging in the outlook,
and the more the situation is studied the more satis
factory it appears.
lu>t before the primary elections the condition of
tlit party was indeed depressing to its loyal support
er^ Its machinery had largely fallen under the con
trol either of ward bosses or of men who had close
affiliations with such bosses. There were well
grounded discontents among the rank and file, and
faction fights among the leaders. So demoralized
was the organization and so weak the party spirit
th< t not a few men of influence in the party were dis
posed to yield the municipal election without a
struggle. It was argued by these men that it would
be better to indorse Phelan than tc put up a candi
date against him; better to let the issue pass than io
attempt to rid the party of Burns and Kelly and
Crimmins and make a fight for the control of the
city under the new charter.
Thanks to the energy of loyal Republicans such
weak counsels were set aside. The business men, the
taxpayers and the intelligent workingmen who make
up the real strength of the party were rallied. The
bosses were routed in the primaries. At the conven
tion a ticket was nominated that every true Repub
lican, that every good citizen, could support without
hesitation. The Honorable Horace Davis, one of the
most eminent men of the city, accepted the nomina
tion for the mayoralty and entered upon a canvass
that won the re-pect of all. As a result the party
re-formed its organization, revived the spirit of its
members, recalled many an indifferent Republican to
his duty, and polled for the head of the ticket more
than 21,000 votes.
The showing made at the polls appears the more
excellent when it is remembered that the campaign
was made on the Republican side upon strictly
legitimate and honorable lines. Nothing in the way
of demagoguery, trickery or personalities was made
use of. The canvass was not only dean, but it was
conducted on the highest plane of political endeavor.
Notwithstanding the irritations caused by the gross
personalities of the Democratic candidates and the
press that supported them, notwithstanding the scur
rilous lampooning of Mr. Davis and the spying prac
ticed upon him, notwithstanding the foul trick of
issuing a forged circular in the name of the Young
Men's Institute designed to injure the Republican
candidates, the Republican pre^s and the Republican
candidates refrained from retaliating in kind. Not a
single vote cast for Horace Davis, therefore, was
cast for him by reason of false pretenses or misrepre
sentation. His vote may be taken as the measure of
the loyal Republican strength of the city â the strength
that can be counted on to stand for Repub!icir.
principles and Republican candidates in every con
ten that comes.
With that much of assured strength the party can
face the future without fear. The old bosses have
been driven from the party organization, and its ma
chinery is now in the hands of men in whom the rank
and file can have confidence. The spirit of victory
'i reawakened and party loyalty restored.
When the time comes for San Francisco Republican
ism to prepare for the Presidential campaign it will
be found in excellent condition. There will be har
mony, loyalty and discipline. The municipal con
test has not been fought in vain.
The New York Post announces the retirement of
E. L. Godkin from active work on that paper. The
retirement is for the purpose of giving Godkin a
rest, and the reader- will also have a rest which they

WATER STORAGE POLICY.
AT last the Escondido Times has made a state
ment of what the Federal irrigators expect to
accomplish. It says that Governor McCord
of Arizona said at Missoula: "Tlio^e who say that it
is idle to expect that Congress will, in this or the
next generation, adept a system of national irriga
tion are either ignorant or dishonest. The}' should
know that Congress at its last session came very near
appropriating $215,000 to begin work upon a national
system of irrigation for the arid West, and that the
leaders agreed with Senators Warren and Carter that
at least that sum should be appropriated by the next
Congress if they would consent to let the matter go
ever."
Therein we have the measure of what is promised
by the next Congress. There are nine States and
Territories concerned together in this matter and the
sum promised will amount to less than $24,000 each.
The Federal irrigators insist that the proposed work
alifornia will cost 50 many millions that the State
caonot afford it. For illustration let us put the cost
at $10,000,000. At the rai >o a year men now
living and their descendants for twelve genera
tions will have no interest in the result. The Times
insists that a system of equitable distribution of the
stored water must precede storage. It puts this as
"imperative," and we admit it. But how is the Fed
eral Government to arrange that system within a
State? Under what grant of power to Congress can
it be done? What kind of a system will it be? Will
it involve the construction by the Federal Govern
ment of canals and ditches to carry the water to the
head gates <>f every user?
The Times says that : "Federal irrigation means
! the reclamation and settlement of the millions of
i acres of arid public lands by the construction by the
Government itself of the irrigation works necessary
to reclaim them, the purchase by the tiller of the soil
of Government land at Government price, plus the
actual pro rata expense of the reclamation of the land
and the water distribution." This may well apply
t<> the States and Territories where the land is yet
part of the public domain. Hut in California the land
that is suffering for a constant supply lies in the
valleys of Southern California and in the valleys
of the San Joaquin and Sacramento rivers,
and on the rim of those valley? in the foothills.
Where, within those areas, are the millions of acres
! of public land that can be made fruitful by water and
sold with the cost of the supply added to the Govern
ment price? The need of California is water to irri
pr.te constantly, in all years, wet or dry, the land now
in private ownership, which the Government has
already sold. Here is just where the Federal idea,
whatever may be its merit, does not apply, except
perhaps on the Colorado Desert, and no one opposes
its operation there or wherever it will apply. The
point to the whole matter is that the policy of Fed
> eral irrigation has for its sole reason the recla
mation of Government lands as a Federal policy, to
make them valuable and secure their sale and Â«ettle
ment." In that view of it alone can Congress be asked
to interfere. That policy may be entered upon at any
time, and perhaps ought to lie. The argument for it
is the same that warrants the river and harbor ap
propriation for securing the navigability of mean
dered streams, and to keep harbors open for deep

j water commerce. But any man, though he may be
"ignorant and dishonest," according to the fine and
argumentative characterization of Governor Mc-
Cord, must see that the vast acreage needful of irri
gation in California, now in private ownership, is
expressly excluded from Federal benefit by the very
reason for which that benefit is asked. The public
domain is Federal property, and the constitution gives
Congress the power to dispose of it, and that carries
the power to appropriate money to make it market
able and tax the cost of that process ta. the buyer.
What California needs is constant water to irrigate
private lands that were never public domain, like the
Spanish and Mexican grants, or that have long since
been patented by the Federal Government to private
owners. This State wants also constant water to
operate her patented mines and to supp I}'1 }' therefor
hydraulic power. Therefore the purposes to be served
here are not directly Federal purposes. They are
private purposes entirely, and can no more be served
by the use of any grant of. power to Congress than
can any other private purpose for personal profit. As
well might we ask Congress to appropriate Federal
money to build for any citizen on his own land a pri
vate fishpond.
It seems clear, then, from- a correct analysis of the
Federal plan, that it stops short where Federal pur
poses cease. As far as Federal purposes go in Cali
fornia everybody is willing that they shall have Fed
eral service, and, instead of opposing, all Californians
will work for it. Our situation requires that for our
larger interests, which lie outside any possible Fed
eral purpose, the State shall supplement Federal ac
tion.
There are a great many things involved in this Fed
eral policy. The public domain in Western Kansas
was sold to settlers as agricultural lands. Year after
year armies of farmers have moved up to those lands
to face starvation, and retreat, defeated in the at
tempt to make them yield. The Government received
about thirty millions of dollars for those lands. The
men who bought them have been making for years
an organized effort to get their money back from the
Government. As soon as Federal irrigation begins
to fit other arid lands for fruitfulness on the public
domain the case of the Western Kansans has a high
color of equity, and the question of refunding their
money has a standing which it never had before. To
them will be joined every buyer of the public do
main who has shared their fate, and a new issue is
presented to the Federal Government.
The local question is, Can California wait outside,
on the desert, in company with the horned toads and
tarantulas which now occupy lands formerly part of
the Mexican and Spanish grants, which may be made
fruitful by an effort at sell-help?
There is going to be a great deaJ of explanation
over the vote in Ohio for the next month, and very
few of the explanations will attribute the big vote of
Jones of Toledo to any devotion on the part of the
voters of Ohio to the golden rule.
TEI ERE arc certain admonitory features in the
off year elections which may be studied by poli
ticians with benefit to their parties. As far as
Mr. Bryan is concerned the result is a hardly polite
invitation to him to vacate the leadership of his party,
to come down and get out of the way. He may mis
interpret the message that is plain to everybody else
and continue to divert himself with dreams, but a
leader who has lost every battle in which he com
manded gets stale. Already the term "poor Bryan"
is current, and that prefix ends a man in public life.
It drove Franklin Pierce into dense obscurity, even
from the high seat of the Presidency.
The center of interest to Republicans in the result
i^ the failure of Nash to get a majority in Ohio. It
is a surprise that industrial conditions there, supposed
to be in a flourishing state, should permit such an
immense margin of discontent as is shown in the
Jones vote. Future peril lies in the possible combi
nation in that State of the supporters of Jones and
McLean, which would far outnumber the Republican
strength. Another matter for Republican reflection
is the fact that the Jones-McLean fight in Ohio was
made mainly and pointedly against imperialism and
the foreign policy of the administration. While the
result presents a gratifying personal victory for Judge
Nash, it leaves the administration in a heavy minority
in the President's own State in test of popular opinion
upon the leading feature of his- policy.
The Republicans have lost Maryland for the same
reason, and the warning that Senator Wellington
gave his party proves to have had ample justification.
While there is justifiable exultation that the party
has fared so well, there is in the result an admonition
that the future will be more secure if the party hasten
to become Republican again. Then its portentous
pluralities will be turned into wholesome majorities,
and it will not need to tremble in fear that a common
ground may be found upon which its opponents can
combine to defeat it.
To return to poor Bryan. His misfortunes are in
creased by the situation in Kentucky. His course in
that contest has raised up enemies for him throughout
the South. People down there arc waspish about out
siders interfering in a family quarrel, and when the
family gets together again the outsider makes the un
pleasant discovery that he has no friends in the com
bination. So his appearance in Kentucky is likely to
increase the Southern tendency to buck and fling
him. He has Nebraska to fall on, and no doubt there
is some local office there which he can take for its
profit and not its honor, and in which he can
grow old and amuse himself by shouldering the parts
of speech and showing how fields are lost.
There is a report that the intercollegiate football
men have requested the British Government to have
no battles in the Transvaal on dates that would con
flict with football games, and that may be the rea

Murderer Suisser is trying to make a jury believe
that he does not remember the killing of Sheriff Far

his neck.
Once more the British are claiming a victory over
the Boers, but the intelligent render will take notice
that the siege of Ladysmith goes briskly on and there
are no signs of retreat on the part of the besiegers.
Admiral Dewey has given the American people

Maud Muller jumped on her time-worn
bike
For an evening hit at the dusty pike.
An old drop frame of a 'way down gear,
With a rattle the sleeping dead could
hear.
The Judge came pounding along behind,
Out airing his great judicial mind.
He noted the figure neat and trim
And graceful motion of hidden limb.
And he said to himself in his grave de
"What's matter with Maudie? She's all
right!"
He drew beside her and asked her flat
Why she rode such an old ice cart as that.
And she said saleslady could ill support
Such wheel as the Judge of the District
Court.
He told her she could on a chalnless ride,
With a diamond frame, if shed be his
bride.
Or, If she would bust up his solo life,
They would tandem together as man and
wife.
Maud bit at the bait like a hungry trout.
And the old Judge smiled as he yanked
her out.
They ride on a tandem now, of course,
But Maud has to work like a treadmill
horse.
But the Judge has learned how to sit and
shirk,
And k-t his darling do all the -.'ork.
He weighs two hundred and fifty-one.
But the poor girl thinks it an even ton.

Oregon Congressmen Urged to Act
Unitedly That Business Interests
May Be Represented in the

The following larg-e business men and
bouses of Sacramento have united in a
! petition to President McKinley for the
; appointment of William K. Wheeler as
Interstate Commerce Commissioner: Hall,
Luhrs & Co., wholesale grocers; Hol
brook, Merrill & Stetson, stoves and bard
ware; Schaw, Ingram, iiau-her & Co.,

Implements; Sullivan. Kelly & Co., whole
sale paints, oils and glass; Wood, Curtis
iV- Co., wholesale produce; Henderson,
Brown & *'0., wholesale produce; Cronan
& \\ Issemann, wholesale liquor dealers.
In their petition they set forth that Mr.
' Win.-- ;>-r is the choice of the business men
of the Pacific Coast and urge upon the
President that the roast deserves recog
nition by appointment on the commission.
K. J. Hendrlcks, chairman of the First
Oregon District Congressional Comma
nd chairman oi the Marion County
Republican Committee, has addressed the
wing to the Oregon delegation in
Congress: "J wish to heartily Indorse the
canaidacj of William K. Wheeler of Ban
: : t: â  .a. ancy on the Inter
i ommerce Commission. 1 know
from former Oregonians now residing in
; rancisco that Mr. Wheeler is emi
nently Qualified for the place and worthy
of it." Mr. Hendricks is the editor of the
I ': â¢ gon Statesman.
Word has been received here that the
hants .it Seattle arc doing what they
to have Mr. Wheeler named by the
President. The movement is growing
daily and no such unanimity ol action
has ever existed among the business men
s has been manifest
ed In this matter. The Seattle Post-In
telligencer of late date had the following:
"The Seattle Chamber of Commerce, hav
ing great confidence In Mr Wheeler's
qualificatioi I ervlce upon the Intor
state Commerce Commission, has ad
dressed each of Washington's Congress
men asking them to give their Influence
to have Mr. Wheeler appointed. Fie is a
public-spirited man and a very able busi
man, and, what is unusual among
men outside of railroad circles, he has
familiar knowledge of railroad traffic and
; is. able i" cope wiih railroad companies
; in plans for making rates on large ship
ments. Congressman Jones l-.as already
telegraphed i" Washington his Indorse
ment of Mr. Wheeler."
[n Stockton the Daily Record is con
sin* ntly and vigorously advocating the
claims of the merchants to recognition in
person of their candidateâ Mr. W'hee
, W. "Aside from all prejudice," Bays the
rd, "Mr. Wheeler Is the only well
equipped man whose name has been men
tloned in connection with the appoint
ment."
The Tulare Register, commenting on the
Southern Pacific claim that opposition to
the candidate of Ilerrin and Rtuhbs is a
cause of dissension, says: "How long,
oh, how long, asks the Sa'i Francisco
Post, will dissensions among Californians
continue to Keep them all away from the
pie counter. That question is easy t >
answer. It will be just so long as th<Â»
Southern Pacific Company and Its little
; coterie of discredited politicians assume
to act for and in the name of the State of
California in all matters political."

Railroad Not Responsible.
Harry C. Visellch, by his guardian,
sued the Southern Pacific Company to re
r damages f"i- personal injuries. H<
w;ts employed on the railroad as an ex
3wttchman at the yards at Stockton.
He was rHinK on the cab when the en
gfine ran into an open switch, colliding
with a train. The boy's lep was erushert,
ssitating amputation. Tn the lower
â¢ be obtained damages, but the Su
preme. <"ouvt bas reversed the .iudg;m<-nt
on the KP'iind that the defendant cor
poration waa nol responsible for the ac
cident. It held that the hlarne lay with
Vizellch'a fellow employes in leaving the
switch open. .
An Excellent Combination.
â¢ The pleasant method and beneficial
effects of the well known remedy,
Syrup of Figs, manufactured by the
California Fig Syrup Co., illustrate
the value of obtaining the liquid laxa-
tive principles of plants known to be
medicinally laxative and presenting
them in the form most refreshing to the
caste and acceptable to the system. It
is the one perfect strengthening laxa-
tive, cleansing the system effectually,
dispelling colds, headaches and fevers
gently yet promptly and en blimp- one
to overcome habitual constipation per-
manently. Its perfect freedom from
every objectionable quality and sub-
stance, and its acting on the kidneys,
liver and bowels, without weakening
or irritating them, make it the ideal
laxative.
In the process of manufacturing figs
are used, as they are pleasant to the
taste, but the medicinal qualities of the
remedy are obtained from senna V.nd
other aromatic plants, by a method
known to the California. Fig Syrup
Co. only. In order to get its beneficial
effects and to avoid imitations, please
remember the full name of the Company
printed on the front of every package.

RETURNS FROM VISIT
TO FOREICN CLIMES
REV. PETER C. YORKE.
REV. FATTIER PETER 0. YORKE returned to this city on last even
ing's overland, after an extended trip through the United States and
Europe, which consumed one year. Father Yorke, who left to take
a much needed reft, comes back in excellent health and spirits. He
was met In Sacramento by Rev. Father O'Ryan and several other priests, and
as lir stepped off the ferry on this Bide was greeted by a large delegation of
friends who hold the distinguished clergyman in the highest regard.
Father Yorke went Immediately to his mother's house at 2102 Van Xess
avenue, where he was domicile.] for the rest of the night. The interior Â«f the
resider.ee had been beautifully decorated with ferns and (lowers in honor of
his return, and there was a quiet but happy gathering of the members of
his family.
Father Yorke had but little to say as to his trip, except that the object
for which he had taken it, namely, the restoration of his health, had been
happily obtained.
"I am glad to be homo in God's own country orfre more," said he. "for I
declare I have found no country as good as ours â not even excepting Ireland.
I left San Francisco at 5:30 p. m. on November S, 1898, and I set foot on her
hospitable shore one year after, to the minute almost. All I can say is that I
have had a delightful trip and feel refreshed both mentally and physically.
My itinerary Included three months in the States, three months in Ireland,
three months in Rome and the rest of the time I put in in England, France
and Germany.
"I was everywhere delightfully entertained, and the incident which I re
gard as the most pleasant in my Journey was the audience which I had with
his Holiness the Pope. I visited the historic scenes of the Continent and the
famous universities of the Old World. In the endeavor to acquire new ideas
and acquaint myself with the latest results of scientific and literary re
search.
"As to my plans for the future r am unable to ppeak definitely on that
subject. Of course, my work will be In this diocese, but just where I cannot
say."
Father Yorke in the beginning of his trip visited Right Rev. Bishop Mont
gomery In Los Angeles and then proceeeded to Phoenix, Ariz., to pee the
friend of his college days, Rev. Eugene O'Growney, the distinguished scholar
of the Celtic Renaissance. He also visited the great National Seminary at
Maynooth, Ireland, and St. Mary's at Baltimore, the two institutions in
which he received his education.
He Is to I"' the guest of honor at several receptions given by various or
ganizations to celebrate his return. A banquet will be tendered him in the
assembly hall of the Sacred Heart College on Thursday evening by the pas
tors and assistant pastors of Catholic churches throughout the city.
Father Yorke's unselfish labors in the cause of justice and humanity are
too well known to be repeated. Only those who are intimately acquainted
with him know how much he did. He did not spare himself whenever work
was to be done. He is not only gifted intellectually, but he has an infinite
capacity for work and the amount he performs is surprising.
"AGENT" LINE
IN PURSUIT OF
BOGUS CORDIALS
Home-Made Goods to
Be Protected.
Dealers who pell spirituous liquors of
domestic manufacture under Imitated
labels <>f Imported poods are very much
agitated over the advent of Freeman I .
Lane, a Minneaoplis lawyer, who claims
to be the attorney tor the Wine and Spir
its Traders' Society of the United States.
The Bociety is saiil to I"- composed of ?m
--porters of foreign liquors and cordials of
high grade, whose business has been In
jured by imitators of their goods under
counterfoil labels.
Mi-. Lane arrived In this city about two
weeks ago and went among the smaller
liquor dealers like a steam mowing ma
chine through a wheat Held. Previous to
that timo he had devastated the Pacific
Coast States and Territories and had
thrown the thrifty element of the liquor
trade Into spasms of consternation.
The matter was brought to the atten
tion of the Federal authorities yesterday
by Julius Levy oi" 261 Third street. Mr.
Levy paid that two men called at his
place of business on the previous day.
One of thc-m displayed a nickel or Bilver
badge which Mr. Levy thought was an
official badge. Tills man did not open his
mouth at all. The oth-r Introduced hun-
B elf according to Levy's staement, as a
special agent, throwing down his card at
the same time. The cara bon the in

Society of the United Btat<
Mr Levy, believing him to be a special
agent of the treasury and authorized to
examine his stock of LiQUors, mad. no
objection when I.ano said that Be wanted
to make an Investigation.
Lane found a bottle of creme de menthe
which in"'P ortprl to l)<1 "' forG'SH origin,
but which Levy, in answer to the ques
tions of Lane, admitted was of domestic
make Lane informed him thai he bad
committed a violation of the copyright
Inw and also of the Revised Statutes, a
section of which provides that goods must
!â put up under the names known to the
trade and that If an article purports to bo
of foreign manufacture it must be of
foreign make. He threatened Levy with
prosecution and advised him to rail on his
attorney. Bert Bchlesinger, In regard to
the matter. He said further that the
Wine and Spirit Traders' Society of the
United States was making these inves
tigations for the protection of Importers
and others and that on behalf of the
Society he (Lane) would be willing to
compromise the matter if Levy paid $50.
Mr Levy was not willing to say that
Lane had represented himself to be a
revenue official, and he was Informed that
the revenue authorities could not inter
fere unless Lane had so represented him
self They informed Mr. Levy also that
he had violated the law as Lane said.
Bert M. Sehleslnger was asked In rela
tion to the statement made by Levy. Mr.
Bchlesinger made the statement that he
had been employed by the Wine and
Spirit Traders' Society to prosecute all
Demons putting Up domestic liquors under
foreign labels and that he proposed to In
stitute several units in the United States
Circuit Court in this city against liquor
dealers. Mr. Levy being among the num
ber It was the purpose of the society, he
Mid, to stop the traffic in fraudulent Imi
tations of imported liquors.
Lane Is snid to be a prominent attorney
of Minneapolis and to have collected from
liquor dealers at least $100,000 by way of
compromises. Tn Butte, Mont., he was
arrested but a telegram from the Gov
ernor of Minnesota vouching for him as
a reputable attorney procured his release
within a few hours. He recently pur
chased a summer resort in Puget City,
paving a good cash sum for it.
ATE THE TURKEY
AND THEN GAVE
HIM THE LAUGH
Andrew Wood Relates
His Woes.
Rev. Andrew Wood, an Oakland min
ister, secured a divorce from his wife,
Luclnda A. Wood, yesterday, on the,
ground of desertion. Rev. Mr. Wood
waited seven long years for his wife to
return to him, he said, but finally hope
deserted him and he decided to seek free
dom in the courts.
Rev. Mr. Wood testified that ho mar
ried his wife in 1870, and that during their
life together she deserted him no l-ss
than six times, returning each time with
a smile, until Thanksgiving day of 1592,
when she departed never to return. On
that occasion Rev. Mr. Wood invited a
party of friends to dinner at Mrs. Wood's
suggestion. When the party arrived they
were met by Mrs. Wood, who smilingly
said that she had devoured -all the turkey
and that they must look elsewhere to
appease their hunger. Mr. Wood was
speechless, and -he and his friends
beat a retreat to a nearby restaurant,
where another turkey was procured and
disposed of. The following day Mr. Wood
returned from his study and found that
his wife had cleaned out the house, as
far as furniture and chattels were con
cerned, and since that time he has not
seen her. Dr. .1. N. Powell, who was one
of the Thanksgiving party, corroborated
Mr. Wood, and Judge Hunt promptly
granted the complainant a divorce.
Decrees of divorce have also been
granted Rhoda Fates from Owen Yaten,
on the ground of willful neglect; Eliza L.
Jones from George E. Jones, on the
ground of failure to provide; Anna M.
Crosby from Frank L. Crosby, on the
ground of failure to provide and cruelty,
and Carrie Aubertin from Charles Au
bertin, on the ground of infidelity.
Suits for divorce have been Bled by
Paul Kahdemann against Kate Kahde
mann, for cruelty; Thekla Frederlkson
against Richard Frederikson. for cruelty,
and L,ouise M. Cole against Jason B.

IV. KING LEAR.
Critical Study of the Play.
(Continued.)
The tragedy of Cordelia in the tragedy
of the inarticulate soul. We nil know
women, and some, men, of such absolute
sincerity nml truenees. with such an abhor
rence of cant ami affectation, filled with
so deep a sense of th<- Inadequacy of
words to express the fervor, reality and
justness of their sentiments, that to the
casual observer they appear stolid, or
stupid, or both. These persona do actual
ly, on the contrary, possess the most ex
quisite sensibilities; art- delicately re
sponsive to the truth or falsity of an
other's character; are intense In love and
friendship; are full, it may be, of poten
tial energy, which they are ready to spend
In attestation of their loyalty or pas
sionate tenderness: and are quite capable
of dying for one who would find it impos
sible to extort from them more than
monosyllabic confessions of attachment.
Of these natures Cordelia stands as the
imperishable type. She is rich in the
treasures of the heart, but maiden timid
ity combines with a certain proud con
sciousness that she needs not to vaunt
her own virtues before those who are
capable of appreciating them, and with an
unconquerable disgust a t the shameless
and blatant hypocrisy of others to place an
inviolable seal upon her lips. Let suf
ficient time elapse; let a real need arise;
let opportunity to prove by such sacri
fices as the unworthy can never make
that she is all devotion, true as the
magnetic steel, pure as the gold just issu
ing from the refiner's fire, and the most
unappreciatlve, the most hostile, will be
convinced. But alas if she dies with all
her music in her! Alas if Lear should
have perished before Cordelia could re
turn!

spirit of the play. S the representative ]
of a class which reckons many members !
in our time, as in every other. He is the
man who convinces himself that he is
the object of Fortune's unmerited dip
favor, and who means to redress the sup- j
posed injustice by every means in his
power. He broods and sulks while his
plans are yet in embryo: and should he !
compass his aims he Will be arrogani and
merciless toward others. He acknowl
edges no obligations of kinship, no duty
toward his rightful superiors or toward
the state. He is restrained by nothing
save prudence, and not always by that;
he can be subtle as lago, and as treach
erous toward his greatest benefactors as
Caliban: false to every one else, he is not
true even to himself; if be ph. mid gain
his ends, he is Incapable of deriving any
permanent good from tils success: but he
usually ruins himself while seeking or ef
fecting the downfall of those whom he
envies, He is the typical anarchist, who,
whether wronged or not by society, Is
the incarnation of envious hatred.
Ooneril and Regan require ao particu
lar mention: they merely embody the in
gratitude of the brute, reinforced by a
flendishness of wh.< h the brute is in
capable, ret it must be observed that
they serve to Illustrate Milton's acute
phrase. "Lust hard by hate." io s n y
nothing of the hate engendered between
them by the guilty love which both eh- '
! tertain for Edmund, and the hate engen
-1 dered in him as a consequence of Ins
: father's illicit amour, it is evident from
many scattered allusions throughout the I
play, which help to create its atmos- j
: phere. and from the persistence with .
Which I. ear. as he sinks deeper and deep
er in his madness, dwells upon the bin
of carnality. US if it wore the root of all |
their evil-doing, that if this piny w. re
not, above everything else, the tragedy. if
ingratitude, it would deserve to be called
fp. tragedy of lust. (Compare, for -x
, ample. I. i". 13 ff . ; I. ii. 187 ft., lÂ«2; 111.
ii. 55, 90; HI. iv. s-1 ff.. 117: 111. v. 21; (V.

V ill. "7 ff.Â». All is of a piece, however;
both sins are Indifferent .n the animal
world (see especially IV. vi. 12 ff.). and
: derive their nelnousneSÃ only from the
â  divinity in man, and from the fact that,
working in close harmony, they effect
ually subvert the constitution of
moral universe. It is significant that
Lear's curse upon Gonerll (I. iv. 207 ff. ;
compare MI ii- 8-0) is fulfilled in both
I sisters, and that their filial ingratitude is ,
in some measure avenged by their ster- '
llity, and by the transfer of the kingdom
to 'the hands of outlawed subjects.
The truths which this drama demon
strates apply not only to individuals, hut \
1 also to nations. Revolutions and violent
! breaches of every sort in the transmlÃ
; sion Â«of power and prerogative always
avenge themselves upon the innovating
â  agency. As Shakespeare himself says:
"Frights, cttanges, horrors
Plvprt and crack, rend and deracinate
The unity and married calm of states
Q-iite from their flxuro."
Such overtures may he necessary, but
they are always lamentable. France Is
still suffering from her revolution, and
we from ours, for violence toward a
parent state or a parenc condition can
by no means escape punis>nment. Tenny
son is right in preferring; that "freedom"
which "slowly broadens down from prec
edent to precedent." and in branding
"raw Haste, half-sister to Delay": ana
Burke was right in maintaining that the
twidy politic cannot be rent asunder, or
its habit suddenly changed, with impun
ity. The generations are knit each to
each by parental and filial ties, and woe
to him who smites a beneficent past in
the face; it is as if he had smitten hi 3
father.
"King Lear" is an elemental tragedy,
because it deals with elemental forces,
with types of which every man's experi
ence can furnish illustrations, and in a
lesser sense because it invokes the ele
ments themselvesâ fire, air, earth and Bea
âin all their wrath and power, as the wit
nesses or coadjutors of the contesting
forces In the moral r^alm. (See 11. iv.
158 ft., 186 ff. : MI. i. I. ff.j 111. ii. 16 ff . : TTI.
iv. 12 ff.: IK. vii. 58 ff . > Here nature apears
in all her primitive directness, outspoken
ness, and disregard of convention; we see
the shock of unbridled will with unbridled
will, hut we do not weep until the scene
is touched by light from a supernal realm,
and our hearts are only overcome by thÂ»
divine pity and sweetness which, in some
inexplicable manner, form the birthright
of Cordelia.

Notes on the Study of the Play.
1. The earliest mention which we have
of "King Lear" is an -entry in the regis
ters of the Stationers' Company. Up to
the passing of the copyright act in 1542
the law required that every publication
should be entered in these registers, and
accordingly under the date of November
26, 1607, we find: "Entred ... A books
called Master William Shakespeare, his
historye of Kingo Lear as yt was played
before the Kinges maiestie at Whitehall
uppon Sainct Stephens night at Christ
mas Last by his majesties servantes,
playinge usually at the Globe on the
Banksyde."
2. There was a considerable interval be
tween this entry of the play and its pub
lication, for it was not till 1608 that it ap
peared in the usual small quarto form
with the following imprint:
London: Primed for Nathaniel Butter, and
are to bo sold at his shop in Fouls Churchyard
at ihe si^ne of the Tide Bull, neere St Austins
Gate. 1608.
That the publication was ' authorize!
either by Shakespeare himself or oy the
company of actors then playing r.t the
Theater there
â is no reason to sup-
Hl'"-'. It was the
â  interest of the
â  actors to guard
â  their property in a.
â  new play as ieal
â  "iisly as possible,
â  and the longer it
â  was before it got
â  into print the less
â  likely it was to fall

â  rival companies.

â  found in several
â  earlier publications.

â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â Lear does not con
â  stitute the whole of
â  the play before us.
â â â â â â â â â â â â â â Skillfully interwoven
â  with it and artistic-
H< r ii;> welded with it

â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â whole is the story of
â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â Gloucester and his
â  two sons. Of this no
â â â â â â â â â â trace is to be found
â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â either in Holinshed
â or in the Chronicle
â  History. It occurs in
â  the second book of
â  sir Philip Sidney's
â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â  "Area dia." a romance
first printed in 1590. and is called: "The
pitiful! State and storie of the Paphla
gonian unkinde King and his kind sonne
first related by the son, and then by the
blind father."
5. As is usual with Shakespeare, the
opening scene, simple as it appears, gives
the key to the situation. The figures on
the stage are two noblemen, Kent aiid
Gloucester, and a lad. or young gentle
man. Kent's first remarks show is the
courtier's astonishment at a sudden,
change of purpose in the Kug.
â¢â¢I thought the Kirn? had more affected (i. c.,
cared more for) the Duke of Albany than Corn
wall."
Glo.â "lt did always seem so to us: but now.
In the division of the kingdom, it appears not
which "l the dukes he values most."
From this we learn that the keynote
of the King's character Is fickleness.

EASTERN MARKETS.
New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK. Nov. The stock market
started off this morning on an apparently
prosperous and animated career of rising
prices, but before the trading had ceased this
afternoon the early gains were practically all
wiped out and a level of prices lower than
Monday was established. Various considera
tions connected with politics were an influence
In the early rise. Thus, the London market
was encouraged by the more cheerful news
from the beleaguered British forces In South
Africa and prices of stocks were bid up in
that market. The Berlin market was pleased
with the report that Great Britain had decided
to relinquish her claims in Samoa to Germany
and one result of this was to prompt Rerlln
to buy KOn:e American stocks. In this country
the relief from the uncertainties of election
time and the hope of an easier monoy market
prompted some large buying of stocks, which
lifted prices at the outset. But there were
large holdings by professional operators which
hud been bought last week on the faith that
an outside demand for stocks would develop
and the first hour of trading was devoted to
the selling of these holdings on a large scale
to take profits When it waÂ» Men that the
buying demand was not continuing in force

made to sustain prices by manipulation of

leather and the heavy selling of. Manhattan

the uneasiness over the future of the money
market completed the discouragement of thÂ»

: CHICAGO. Nov. S.â The loss in Liverpool '
' worked potently on the price of wheat at the I
j opening. be initial price was under puts lit
; a loss from yesterday of Vi?i%c, December at
! 68%@65%e, and May at 72 l >i'ij72 At these '
j figures there was some buying by shorts and j
. against holders of puts which resulted in a
! rally of Vie. This failed to hold. The fact
: that there was almost no outside demand acted
; aÂ±> a bearish Influence and there was a rush
:to dispose of long stocks on the bulge. The
; price declined. Iâ¢â  â  -;i i â â â¢: to GSÂ«r,<9Bs'.ic and
; May to 72%'&72V2C. At this point there was a
I rally caused by determined effort to protect i
I puts, which sent the December option to fiS%c
i and the -May to 72ft'S'72 | Sic. These figures acted i
| merely as a. bait to holders, and the price eased ;
j off on profit-taking to 68% c for December and
1 72 \ie for May. The close was weak. December
jat SS'.jifiS&iic and May at 72',-ic. At no time
did the price get above puts. A reported in- :
crea.se of 25,000,000 bushels in the world's stock
for October had much to do with the closing
weakness.
; Corn showed little strength following wheat
!on the Liverpool weakness. December closed
jat ZlVk@2VAc May closed at 32ftc.
! Sympathy with corn and some liberal selling
by shorts caused a decline of %c in oats. De
cember closed at 22Si(g22ftc.
Irregularity marked the trade in provisions.
The opening was at a Flight gain, and this was
followed by an advance chiefly In pork, which
went up 7V<.c, caused by investment buying and
liberal shipping orders. The market turned
weak later on free selling of pork and lard. !

cular says:
"The local market has ruled quiet since our
last review. In New York spot Brazils ad
vanced slightly on October 19, and are now %a
%c Â»above their lowest point with a correspond
ing improvement in futures. The rise was pri
marily due to rumors of bubonic plague at San
tosâsubsequently confirmed as being desultory
only In character and extentâ has since
been maintained by retarded receipts at the
two ports, owing to heavy rains, higher views
on the part of the Brazilians and rumors of less
favorable crop prospects. Mini coffees have ex
perienced little practical benefit beyond impart
Ins a steadier feeling. Local stocks are so small

WIFE ELOPED
AND IN HIDING
FROM HUSBAND
Mr. Howe Seeks His
Young Daughter.
SIRS. HOWE AND DAUGHTER ELLA.
â¢
Oakland Office San Francisco C ill,
90S Broadway, Nov. 8.
W. O. Howe, a merchant of this city,
Js punting a wife who has eloped, but far
more- anxiously is he trying to regain his
li^yearfpld daughter, whom tho mother
took away with her. Howe has invoked
the assistance of the Society for the Pre
vention to Cruelty to Children In his
search.
FOr the ra.Pt two years things have not
been going as they should in the Howe
residence, and they became much worse
several months ago, when a stranger
vent to live with them. This stranger
exercised a hypnotic influence over Mrs.
Howe, "and finally they went off together
. without notifying the head of the house, j
"About ten months ago," said Mr. ]
â  Howe, "my wife surprised me by telling i
me that she did not have any more love i
fur me. This was in response to a pro
testation of mine against her open I
friendship with a man named W. V. j
Durbin, who was stopping at my house. I
' and who exercised a powerful influence
over my wife. At that time I left my
home for a fÂ»-w days, and finally resolved
: to; take my place in the family. "so I wont
back and ordered this man out and for
bade his meeting my wife any more at
any time or place. I then tried to re- |
store domestic affairs as they were be- '
fore' this man crossed our path, but I
tu>on discovered that Mrs. Howe was so
much absorbed in meeting her friend ]
that she had no time or inclination to
look after our home. Finally I went
home one evening and found my house
deserted, my wife and youngest daugh
ter. Ella, having gone.
'.'For a time 1 supposed they were In
Pan Francisco, but I learned later that
she and the girl and Durbin had gone to
ban Jose, where they passed as cousins.
For some months I have not known of
their location or condition, though I have
frequently sent her letters through the
postofHce, imploring her to send my
daughter tack. Since they left San Jose
I have no trace of them. My purpose in
desiring to learn their whereabouts is to
protect my child, for I realize that it
la useles trying to win back my wife. I
have a good home and am perfectly able
to- support thorn, and believe that !t is !
absolutely Imperative that my girl should
be recovered and placed back with us,
and not remain in the company of my
wife and Durbln."

POLITENESS PAYS.
George 11. GrifHng, naval paymaster,
who arrived on the government transport
St. Paul, gave the customs officials some
trouble yesterday by peremptorily, refus
ing to make a statement as to his dutiable
baggage. He gave the officials the im
pression that he was a favored personage
and they reported the matter to Deputy
Customs Surveyor .miiiiccy M. St. John.
Mr. St. John at once caused the baggage
to be seized and brought to the Apprais
er's store, where It will be passed upon in
the usual way, Griffin*? being obliged to
make the regular Custom-house entry.
It has been the practice of customs offi
cials to extend every courtesy to United
States officers and soldiers 90 that the
entry of their baggage may be expedited.
Gritfing, by refusin- to till out the blank
tendered him, will be put to considerable

WOMAN SUFFRAGE
THE SUBJECT DISCUSSED
THE STATE ASSOCIATION IN AN
NUAL CONVENTION.
The Woman's Suffrage State Associa
tion resumed its annual convention yes
!n Golden Gate Hall, nn<l a large
gathering of ladies Interested in the work
uas present when Mrs. John F. Swift,
president of the organisation, called the
meeting to order. The session was de
voted to papers, all touching on the
movement, which were read by several
delegates.
Mrs. B. O. Smith, in her remarks, said
that the association had done some good
running', but had not yet won a nice. She
argued that, as there should be no taxa
tion without representation, therefore,
the women should be granted the right
df political equality.
Miss S. Severance of Pacific Grove
scored Governor Gage for having refused
t<> sitrn the school suffrage bill, and char
acterized the legal reasons which he gave
for not doing go as not borne out by the
constitution. Miss Severance showed
!.. rself possessed of an intimate knowl
>f the law on tho .sulijeet, and her
remarks were frequently punctuated with
applause.
Miss Mary G. Hay, the representative
Of the National Woman's. Suffrage Asso
ciation, Stated that full suffr..- -> was re
quired by the women of this nation. She
deprecated half-way measures, as they
did not help to bring about the linal ia
sue.
Mrs. William Keith said thru the States
that would not allow the women to vote
were not averse to collecting taxes from
th-- very ou.s who were disfranchised.
Hhe was followed by Miss Clara Si-hliiig
heyde, who spoke of the educational
boards that deprive teachers of their just
salaries and made expensive contracts in
order to pay off their political debts. She
declared that the only equality of power
that woman could possess lies In the bal
lot. Miss Solomons also read a paper
and Mrs. Swift announced that there
would be a reception in the parlors of the
hall next Monday morning at 10 o'clock
when all interested In woman's suffrage
are requested to attend.
In the evening Mrs. Carrie Chapman-
Catt delivered an address entitled, "A
Prophecy." In which she predicted the
Ultimate victory for her sex in the great
battle now being waged for equal suf
frage with man.
Resolutions presented by the committee
on resolutions, consisting of Mrs. m l
W. Curtis, chairman. Mrs. Ella Sargent
and Mrs. Anna K. Spere, were adopted
favoring the appointment of women on
the San Francisco School Hoard Hoard
of Health, State Insane asylums and
other institutions where women and chil
dren are cared for. Thanks were extend
ed to the press of this city and State for
its liberal attitude toward the movemnnt
for the political recognition and equality
of women. *
A petition will be Bent to the Senate
and House of Representatives to omit th<>
word "male" from the suffrage clause of
the new constitution to be proposed for

YOUNG SCORED
BY HIS LATEST
HOUSEKEEPER
Mrs. McCord Tells a
Few Secrets.
ROBERT S. YOUNG.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Nov. 8.
Robert S. Young, who locked his house
keeper up Monday night, is not yet out of
the woods. Mrs. Virginia McCord, the
victim of his remarkable method of get
ting rid of a housekeeper, has a very in
teresting story to tell. The month that
she lived at th<! Young house was a reve
lation to her, and now she has learned
that Mr. Young traded on her name as
his wife. She has several accounts in her
possession which have been mailed to
"Mrs. R. S. Young," and which Young
contracted without her knowledge or con
sent.
"I have a most unimpeachable reputa
tion," said Mrs. McCord this afternoon,
"and the only construction I can put upon
Young's conduct is that he was a lunatic.
He certainly suffers from monomaniaâ
woman, for months I learn and have
proof that he has been advertising for an
eligible wife or housekeeper, frequently
mentioning the particular religious de
nomination which he prefers. !!â¢ has even
made capital out of an alleged warm
friendship with Rev. Dr. it Dr.
Coyle assures me that he Is in no
a sponsor for Mr. Young, and knows noth
ing about him. My attorney has under
consideration the advisability of causing
Young's arrest, and there are several
charges, so 1 am Informed, that could be
brought against him. He has done me
the justice to say that I was a good
housekeeper and that my character is
above reproach, but after his unwar
ranted conduct last Monday night I
do not think he has any reason to ex
pect any particular leniency from me
When he answered my advertisement for
a situation the understanding was that
he was to keep a rooming house and I
was to take charge of it. But I found
afterward that it was not roomers
wanted. His animosity toward me was
doubtless Inspired by the fact that I pos
itively declined his many off-rs to go
buggy riding or to attend church with
him. and. further, he cannot tell the
truth and makes little effort to pay his
bills. As T said before, I think he is r.ot
responsible."
Mrs. McCord is the wife of a San Fran
cisco real estate mnn. who went to the
Klondike two years ago. Six months
later Mrs. McCord heard from him and
received some money from him. but since
that date nothing has been heard of him
and Mrs. McCord has been forced to earn
a living for herself and little boy. Before
this necessity came upon her she and her
husband lived in luxurious style at the
Sutherland in San Francisco.
"UNLOADED" GUN MAY
COST A CHILD'S LIFE
OAKLAND, Nov. 8. â George Ogg, who Is but nine years old, was shot in
the head this afternoon while looking at some revolvers in a hardware
store on Washington street. It Is almost impossible that he can recover.
Eddie Jacobs, who is 13; Lyle Bowen, aged 15, and little Ogg went
into Maxwell's store to buy a revolver. The clerk showed them some, and
Jacobs, who was to be the purchaser, tried the trigger of one, not knowing
that it was loaded. Instantly there was a report and Ogg fell to the floor with
the bullet in his head.
Prs. Mehrmann, Cunningham and Strntton examined the lad's head at the
Receiving Hospital, but could not find the bullet. At a depth of four inches into
th.^ brain nothing could be located, and the doctors ceased probing, stating
that if it were deeper it would be almost impossible to recover it. It is prob
able that the bullet is resting on the Inside of the back of the skull, having
passed clear through the brain.
The boy is perfectly conscious and talks quite clearly of the accident,
but the doctors do not hold out one chance in a thousand for his recovery.
The clerk in the hardware store says he had no idea that the revolver was
loaded.

PIONEER DURR
DIES IN WANT
AT KAYWARDS
Once a Millionaire of
This State.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, Nov. 8.
J. Durr, at one time one of the wealth- j
lest men of San Francisco, died in
poverty at a little cabin near Haywards
this morning. Forty years ago Durr w;is
a millionaire and ono of San ifrancisco's
most sbccessful merchant kings. The
firm of Kennedy & Durr, of which he
was for a long time a partner, did one
of tlie largest dry goods businesses In the
metropolis, and the profits wire com
mensurate with the business transacted.
Several years hk y " Durr's domi
troubles proved thi- beginning 01 his un
doing. In addition to this, he made sev
eral very bad speculations, arid from ne
ing one of the men most prominent in the
public eye he suddenly dropped com
pletely out of sight for a number of
years.
About a year ago the people of San
Francisco were horrified to learn fiat
Durr and his three educated daughters
were starving â  in a hovel In nn
Obscure pan of the city. Reared
in luxury nnd accustomed t" all I
the accommodation and pleasure that I
money could purchase, the Durrs
were even utterly helpless to help them
selves when dire misfortune came upon
them. They were discovered by accident,
and what was more sorrowful -han the
discovery ol their poverty was the fact
that their fearful trials â â â¢â â¢â â â  l deprivations
had affected their r< a
All of the Durrs were of a proud and
haughty disposition, and wen

known to their friends of wealthy days
the fact that eeven bread could nol be
obtained ii sufficient quantities to ratisfy
hunger.
Alter f ho revelation of the Durrs' con
dition in Ban Francisco they roel with
Home assistance, but tluir proud spirit
Impelled them to leave tha big city where
they were known and to seek scclus'on
in the cabin near Haywards. For several
months they have Just managed to sub
sist mostly because "f the kindness of
their neighbors, but partly by the .-mall
amount earned by one of the nirls, who
peddles small articles of clothing in Eden
Township. The three girls, . h hough
weakened mentally by their trials, were
not In such condition as to make them
propi r subjects tor State care so the
family has dragged out an existence near
the foothills.
For several days tho father, /ho was
about 70 years of age, haÂ«l been seriously
ill, but n ntf >t until this morning, when his
death was announced, did any at the
Neighbors know that his sickness was
more than a temporary ailment.
Unl< ss some friend shall have com? to
the family's immediate relief, the county
of Alameda will be charged with the
burial of the once wealthy pioneer mer
chant.
TALKING TO HERSELF
SCARED OFF BURGLARS
OAKLAND, Nov. B.â Burglars are hold
ing a carnival in the annex district, but
are not meeting with much success. Last
night the presence <>!' mind of Mrs. V. R.
Smith saved her house from being ran
sacked. iler husband is a conductor on
the streetcar line and was away at. work.
Mrs. Smith heard the burglars enter the
house, being in the kitchen at the time.
When the thieves got into the dining
room Mrs. Smith began talking as
-â  h her husband was at home. ''I
wish you would light the light in the
dining-room," she said. At this the bur
glars became alarmed and fled without
waiting lo finish their search for valu
ables.
Christian Endeavor Convention.
ALAMEDA, Nov. B.â The Alameda
County Christian Endeavor Union will

rian Church of this city next Friday
afternoon and evening. An excellent pro
gramme has been arranged, including ad
dresses by B( veral of the most prominent
workers and speakers connected with the

WATCHING FOR A
METEOR SHOWER
Preparations Made at
Lick Observatory.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, Nov. B.â A big shower of
meteors is expected by the astronomers
at Lick Observatory on the morning of
November 16. These heavenly displays
only occur every thirty-three years. The
last time they were witnessed meteors
fell at the rate of from fifteen to twenty
per hour, luu this display is expected to
be a brighter one. The meteors are known
as tho Leonides and appear to come direct
fnun the constellation Leo.
At Lick Observatory arrangements have
been made to photograph the meteors
with two photo-telescopes, with six-inch
apertures. Resides, their direction will be
marked on charts.
According to signs, the r-hower should
begin on tho morning of November 16,
about 1 o'clock. However, It may be a
little off either way, and the astronomers
will Tteep a strict watch for two days pre
ceding and after the 16th. The direction
of the flight of the meteors will be toward
tho east. It will be nearly a full moon at
the time and its brightness may Inter
fere with the observations to some extent.
Most of the meteors will be discernible
to the naked eye, and should the fall of
mele , )rs reach the frequency expected It
will be a grand sight.
EMPLOYES OF THE
ASYLUM WORRIED
Dt. Crane, the New Medical Director,
Makes Changes Irrespective
of Political Pulls.
PAN JOSE, Nov. B.â Never before has
there been such uncertainty about things
;u Agnewa Asylum as now, and attend
j ants and employes are all possessed of a
fear that they are to be the next to go.
The trustees are also worried, for some
of their pets have already been dismissed.
Medical Director Crane Is proving a thorn
in the side of the trustees. A "pull" has
! always been sufficient to keep any kinid
of person employed at the asylum here
tofore, but Dr. Crane has revolutionized
things. Ever since the last meeting, when
he told the trustees be did not agree with
Governor Gage's political methods, he has
been conducting things to suit himsr-if.
This is demonstrated by the report of the
management committee at the meeting
to-, lay, which shows live changes during
the month of October in the employes
and as many reappointed, and these, too,
without kowtowing to the trustees. Four
of them come under the head of resigna
tions, but the trustees themselves admit
they were forced.
The changes are as follows: Resigned
â H. N. Turner, assistant attendant; Miss
1.. D. Bambauer, matron; K. H. Snapp,
attendant; Thomas McGlone, laundry
help. Dischargedâ H. W. Conner, black
smith. Appointedâ \V. J. Thompson, An
nie M. Grone, J. A. French, assistant at
tendants; J. M. Waste, druggist; A. L.
Fitzgerald, matron.
It is believed the limit has not yet been
reached, and that Dr. Crane will make
many more changes.

GILMAN AT STANFORD.
President of Johns Hopkins Univer-
sity Addresses Students.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Nov. B.â
President Daniel C. Oilman of Johns
Hopkins University spent the day here.
President Jordan gave him a reception in
the afternoon and following this Oilman
gave an informal talk before the faculty
and students on topics naturally sug
gested by the place and hour. He began
with pleasant references to the institu
tion and its history and its pleasant re
lations with its sister university at
Berkeley.
He told of his acquaintance with Leland
Stanford and his wife. He spoke in strong
terms of Stanford's wisdom, sound judg
ment and intelligent interest in higher
education, and at the same time paid a
worthy eulogy to Mrs. Stanford's devo
tion to the early plans of her husband
and herself. He spoke of the unique fea
tures of the university, the beauty of its
housing, the freedom of its courses and
Its breadth of range, and urged the etu
dents to make the greatest use of this
advantage. Oilman closed with an ap
peal to the students to develop ideals of
personal life, character and duty and to
follow these ideals fully and "unflinch
ingly.
Easy Thing for Tramps.
PASADENA, Nov. B.â The local consta
j bles and police have discovered an inter
j esting excursion system being practiced
by tramps that has been the means of
giving the fraternity probably hundreds
of miles of transportation. Almost every
I night from two to ten tramps board the
I Santa Fe freight that leaves Los Angeles
eastbound at 10 o'clock. They cannot get
on in Los Angeles, so they walk to Pasa
dena and catch the train when it slows up
to register. The train has become known
as "the tramps' accommodation" on this
i account. The officers say that the tramps
; all over this section have been Informed
of its facilities and they make use of
them. On? constable caught fifteen hobos
in one night, and again two constables
got together eleven. The officers say
1 there are a surprising number of juveniles
i among the tramps this year. More than
i half those arrested this week were mere
I boys. They have stolen several bicycles
of late.

I an American miner confined In tho pro

ARGUING THE
WAR TAX CASE
People Versus Express
Companies.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Nov. B.â The United
States Supreme Court to-day began the
b< uring in the rase of the Merchants' As
| Bociatlon of New York, brought in the
name of William Crawford, against the
A Jams Express Company, to test whether
I the express companies or the shippers
should pay the war revenue tax charged
upon pacKages sent by express.
Frederick K. Kellogg opened the case
for the merchants and was followed by
Charles Steele for the express companies. |
1 It was contended on behalf of the mer- j
chants that the tax was imposed exelu- |
! aively upon the business of transports.- j
i tion and was intended to be borne by the !
carrier in all cases where it accepted
goods for transportation; and also that
! the imposition of this tax upon the car
, rier precluded it from relieving itself of
: the expense by refusing to accept goods |
(or transportation unless the unwilling
shipper himself assumed the burden.
It was argued that the refusal of the
express companies to carry packages
I upon which the tax had not been paid was j
an unlawful and unreasonable restriction
! of trade and ihe court was asked to en
join them from making such refusal.
Mr. Steele, as counsel for the express
companies, took the position that the war
i revenue tax was not intended by Congress |
I to be imposed exclusively upon the ex
press company, even In the first instance,
; but that it was placed simply upon ihr.
transaction of shipment, to be paid indif
ferently by either party; and that even
if the express company were compelled
exclusively by the statute to pay the tax
in the first instance, yet it was left free
to relieve Itself of this expense by refus
ing to accept express packages for trans
portation unless the shippers agreed to
assume the burden.
Mr. Steele assorted that the Adams
Company carried about 2^.000,000 packages
j annually. The tax upon these would
i amount to $250.000, or 2' 2 per cent of the
nominal par value of the company's cap
i ital stock. This, he argued, would be un
reasonable, while if |mid by the shipping
public it would not be felt.
The hearing will continue to-morrow.

told him I had come for my answer to the
note I had written you asking for an interview.
I saw by that that you were expecting me. I
had to he in court at 10 o'clock and it was past
10 o'clock. I got up and spoke to Mr. Martin
and told him to tell you I would be back at 4
o'clock [that was the time that was appointed
the three calls I had made before). Mr. Martin
told me you said you would not see me, so I
need not come. It seems scarcely worth while
for a Judge of the court to so far forget his
dignity as to leave such a message for any
one that he had spoken bo often about in
court c.~o it has been repeated to me). 1 am
not a coward and I will see any one In self
defense. Mr. Martin knew there had been
something said, for he tried to screen you by
paying you had never mentioned my name. I
have always understood that you had a great
deal to say about my influence with Mrs. Bell
and the children. Now, Mr. Bell was a gen
tleman, and he knew what I was there for.
and I knew -what I was there for; he knew
what my influence was in his family. He
should have known after twenty odd years, and
died satisfied with me, and It shows very poor
taste for any one after all of these years to
try to Interfere from the bench or elsewhere
(as it has been . reported to me). Mr. Bell's
friends have no such Ideas, for they sent me
word last summer from Glen Ellen to come
and bring Reginald BelL He was up there
living in the servants' quarters, uncontrolled by
anybody, drinking with the men and any one
who came along- the mad. If I had gone up
and brought him down as I ought to have done i
I should have been censured and called a very
bad woman. If Mr. Bell had been alive he j
would have expected me to have gone up and i
brought Reggie down, and Mr. Bell would have
Foon silenced those who said I had too much |
influence. I never heard of that boy drinking ;
or getting drunk before last summer, and he i
was there all summer. I have had a good deal i
to say about the executors and lawyer for the j
Bell estate selling their assets to pay their |
own debts. I told It to the lawyers and now '
I have told to to you. That would be a very good i
thing- for you to Bay from the bench, if you must
say something, and I will prove it to you.
These are the kind of things I have been Bay
ing that mnkes me such a bad woman in the
f-stimation of people that are not straight them
selves. I have said them to the principals them
selves. Of the two 1 would prefer to be a i
corpse than a coward! 1 saw one of the j
brothers yesterday from the St. Mary's Col- j
lege, and I would not insult Brother Hugh by I
sending such a message, that he had been re
fused to be Fern, Rnd I am more than glad I
that he does not know who I went to see with
him. When the bill for the boys was not paid
I gave Brother Hugh my personal note and
paid it when it was due to keep the boys in the i
Catholic scl mi. I also told Mother Elizabeth
how the Bell estate was being distributed and
if there was nothing left I would
pay the two hundred and some odd
dollars, for that is what Is due them
now. The executors and lawyer for the Bell
estate were bringing law suits ngalnst the
estate and giving assets that had been paid to
people to pay their own debts. Now, this wo
man who has respect for the right and the
truth would like to have you use your influ
ence. M. K. PLEASANT.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 9, 1899.
SHARKEY'S DEFEAT LEADS
TO A COBBLER'S SUICIDE
CRAZED from financial reverses
due to a passion for plunging on
prizefights, O. T. Lind, a shoema
ker, whose home was at 1633
Devlsadero street, committed suicide
yesterday on. the ocean beach near the
Olympic pier by swallowing the con
tents of a small bottle of carbolic acid.
Heavy losses on the Sharkey -Jeffries
fight are said to have been the imme
diate cause of the cobbler's desperate
act.
Lind chose an ideal day for such
grewsome work. The sea was running
high, the breakers beating on the sand
dunes, which Lind had chosen as the
: (-destruction, while the
rain came down in torrents and the sea
moaned a requiem. Lind had been a
habitue of the beach for some months,
although he carefully avoided disclos
ing his Identity to any of those with
whom he became acquainted. About
two months ago he attempted to com-

TOTAL VOTE AS COMPARED
WITH 1896 AND 1898.
Steps Taken to Make an Effective
Republican Organization for the
Great Presidential Cam
paign of 1900.
The semi-official returns from each
voting precinct show that the number
of votes polled ,at the election last Tues
day was 52.005. At the general election
held In November, 1898, when Gage and
Maguire were candidates, the total vote
of San Francisco was 54,372. In the na
tional election In ISM, when McKinley and
Bryan were running, this city cast
62,963 votes.
From opinions expressed at headquar
ters of the Republican committee the con
clusion is reached that the Republicans
are not depressed over the repulse on the
skirmish line last Tuesday. The fact is
cited that the party elected the Sheriff,
Auditor, County Clerk and Tax Collector,
and cast more than 21,000 votes for Hor
ace Davis, the nominee for Mayor.
The public Wi.l be allowed a respite from
political agitation until next spring. In
April, probably, the agitation will be re
sumed. Doubtless the national conven
tion will meet in June; hence State con
ventions to elect delegates to the na
tional councils will probably be held
early in May. -;-

Yesterday morning: he went out to

From the nature of his conversation
Green formed the opinion that Lind

carbolic acid, and the burns on the
man's mouth and lips left no doubt as
to the manner of his taking off. The
manner in which the wet sand was dis
turbed gave evidence that Lind had
suffered untold agony before tho fatal
draught had completed its work. He
had rolled and kicked and clawed into
the sand over a surface fully twenty
feet square before death relieved him
from the torture of the burning poi
son.
The body was removed to the
Morgue, where it was Identified by
moans of some business cards in the
clothing. From acquaintances of the
Filicide living near his cobbler shop it
was learned that he bet heavily on the
wrong end of the Sharkey-Jeffries
fight and seemed very much downcast
over his losses. He has been drinking
heavily since the flght. He leaves a
wife. The inquest will be held this
morning.

A
COMMENDABLE WORK
OF THE REGISTRAR
Registrar J. Steppacher is deserving of
the warmest thanks of the community for
the very efficient manner in which the re
turns of Tuesday's election were handled
by his office and furnished to the public
and the press. One has but a faint con
ception of the stupendous task before cue
Registrar in arranging for and conducting
an electionâ the registration, the map
ping out of the various districts, the lo
cating of the hundreds of precincts, the
selection of the officers of election, the
erection of the voting booths and their
care, and many other matters that keep
a large force busy day and night for many
months.
Mr. Steppacher has been exceedingly
painstaking in all his arrangements and
not a single little detail has escaped him.
He has been ably assisted by an excel
lent corps of deputies, most of whom are
veterans in the office of the Registrar.
Mr. Steppacher, who enjoys the esteem
and confidence of men of all parties, made
exceptionally good appointments of pre
cinct officers, as was demonstrated by the
admirable way in which the returns were
received at the City Hall, both by tele
phone and by messenger. There was
comparatively little delay, and there
was no dereliction of duty reported from
any direction.
Ihe Registrar and his deputies have
performed their arduous labors in a splen
did manner and are entitled to the high
est commendation. Mr. Steppacher has
shown himself to be a very capable offi
cer, and his excellent work on Tuesday
augurs well for the future.
