NUMBER OF VICTIMS
Several Thousand Killed by the
Hurricane in Porto Rico â One
Hundred Thousand Homeless,

rAT.T> HEADQUARTERS, WEL
LINGTON HOTEL. WASHINGTON,
Aug. L3.â Further details received to
day from Governor General Davis re
garding the effects of the hurricane in
Rico show that the situation is
even more appalling than at first re
ported. Here are the estimates Oen
eral Davis pives of the damage
wrought:
One thousand persons killed by
falling walls. This number, he adds.
may be multiplied several times by
later information.
One hundred thousand persons
homeless and destitute.
One-fifth of all dwellings on island
destroyed.
All crops and most of the trees in
jured.
So greatly was Secretary Root Im
pressed with the gravity of the situa
tion that, after receiving Davis' dis
patch, he decided to supplement his
appeals to Mayors of large cities, by
addressing similar communications to
Governors of States, urging them
:t measures for the collection
ntributions. This appeal will be
â¢ orrow.
!: iot said to The Call correspondent:
"The Government cannot do much, but
it will do all in its power to relieve the
ring caused by this terrible dis-
The McPherson will start to
jnorrow, and I shall send other supplies
as ra possible. In this emerg
however, we are forced to rely on
â¢sity of the American people.
We have no money properly available
for buying- the supplies we are sending,
but until the contributions of the peo
come in I shall continue to send
provisions, no matter from what spe
cial fund the money may have t-> be
derived. I will nut allow the people
t<> starve while 1 have power to help
them. I feel confident that the pa
triotism and generosity of the people
of the United States will no-t be ap
pealed to in vain."
Appended are the dispatches received
by the War Department from General
Davis to-day:

PEOPLE OF PONCE
BURYING THEIR DEAD
PONCE, Porto Rico. Aug. 13.âAl
though the disasters which followed the
hurricane have not been overesti
mated, the people are hopeful and en
ring to make the best of the situ
ation. Dead bodies are buried where
they are found.
Food suppli-s are b r -ing distributed
and repairs to bridges and roads are
being pushed forward under military
supervision, with payments to work
men daily.
It is gathered from interviews with
merchants and planters, some of whom
owe European houses, that there will
be numerous failures.
The steamer Australia, with cargo.

HURRICANE SEEMS
TO BE DECREASING
WASHINGTON, Aug. 13.â The West
Tndian hurricane appears to be gradu
ally decreasing in strength, and the
chances are that it will spend itself be
fore making much further progress.
This is the welcome news given out by
the ofiieials of the weather bureau to
night. It is based on the fact that there
has not been any decided fall in the
barometer In the localities that should
feel its effect, and by the presence of
an area of high pressure in the north
ern part of the United States which
tends to keep the storm from continu
ing on its onward march. The move
ment of the hurricane is apparently
very slow, and even at Jacksonville the
velocity of the wind this morning was
but twenty-one miles an hour. The
opinion of the officials is that by the
time Charleston is reached there will be
no more than an ordinary blow. Wil
mington. N. C, and Norfolk have taken
down their hurricane signals. The
storm now appears to he on the east
coast of Florida, and the latest reports
from Jupiter, dated at 4 o'clock this
morning, indicate a pretty severe blow
at that place. It is now south of Jack
sonville, indicating' a slow northward
movement since last night. The bureau
has had no wire reports south of Titus
ville, Fla.. some distance below Jack
sonville, sine.- last night, and nothing
from Nassau, Bahama Islands, since
Friday afternoon.

MAITRE LABORI OF
DREYFUS COUNSEL
SHOT FROM AMBUSH
jr^ENNES, Aug. 14.â Two
jf\ men ambushed Maitre La
bori, counsel for Dreyfus,
and one shot was fired. Jutting La
bori in the back. M. Labori fell in
the roadway. He is still alive.
Maitre Labori left his house
alone for the court at about 6 o'clock
this morning. His residence is sit
uated in the suburbs of the town,
about a quarter of an hour's walk
from the Lycec, the route being
along a solitary road beside the
river I 'Maine.
He had reached a point half way
on his journey when two men, who
had evidently been lying in wait\
for him, rushed out of a narrow
lane, and one of them tired a single
shot from a revolver. The assas
sins were oidy a couple of yards
\ behind their victim, and the bullet
struck Mai f re Labori in the back.
The wounded man uttered an agon
icing cry and fell Hat on his face.
The assassins immediately fled
through the lane from which they 1
had emerged and both escaped.
At 7:10 o'clock it was announced
, that the bullet had entered the stom
ach; that there zvas no outward
bleeding and that the physicians be- \
licve that M. Labori zvill die from \
: the wound.
Only two or throe laborers coins to
work witnessed the shooting of Maitre
Labori. The Bpot was well chosen, as
the murderers could not be seen by M.
Labori until they rushed out upon their
victim, the entrance to the lane being
hidden by bushes. Moreover, they were
afforded an easy means of escape by
passing back through the lane which
led to the country. One of the laborers.
! named Patoux, who witnessed the ;
shooting 1 , said :
"As I was passing along the road I
I saw a tall man walking quickly in the!

Three Important Characters Involved in the Dreyfus
Case.
Colonel Schwarzkoppen was in 1894 the German military attache at
Paris, from whose waste basket the famous bordereau was claimed to have
been taken. Count Panizzardi was the Italian military attache, to whom
this "loyal" letter waft said to have been addressed by Schwarzkoppen.
Colonel Maurel was president of thÂ« court-martial which convicted Dreyfua
in 1594 and to whom General Mercier hinded secret documents to be shown
to the members of tha court in private.

"A sharp report was heard and M.
Lahori threw up his arms and fell flat
upon his face. I and one or two others
saw the deed, ran up, but the mur
derers had vanished down the lane.
Help was immediately sent for and the
gendarmes quickly arrived, and soon
afterward lime. Labor)."
RENXES, Aug. 13. â To-morrow's ses
sion of the Dreyfus court-martial is
awaited with the greatest anxiety and
I expectation, in view of the confronta
i tion of Mercier by Casimir-Perier, when
the former will virtually be in the pris
oner's dock. A dramatic scene is inev
itable.
It is understood that an even more
thrilling incident than that which
ended yesterday's session was expected
by the counsel of Dreyfus and would
have occurred but for General Mer
cier's prudence. Dreyfus intended and
had actually declared his determination
to slap Mercier's face before the whole
court if he brought up the story of th
relations of Dreyfus with Mme. 8.,
whom some newspapers have asserted
acted as a go-between for Dreyfus and
the attache to whom he is alleged to
have made treasonable revelations.
General -Mercier abstained from ref
erence to the story, but despite this the
people in the court thought for a mo
ment that Dreyfus was about to strike
Mercier, until a captain of gendarmes
took him gently by the arm and pushed
him hack into his seat.
The Petit Journal and some other
papers, including: those published here,
accused the foreign press men present
in the court of being the authors of the
demonstration against Mercier when he
left the court. The accusation is ridic
ulous and was prompted by the obvious
desire of the anti-revisionists to ex
clude foreign newspaper men from
what they maintain is purely a French
matter. It was even stated that meas
ures would be taken against the for
eign correspondents. About sixty of the
latter met this evening to protest
against the charge. During the course
.>f the proceedings, Mme. Severine, the
i famous woman journalist, came on be
half of the committee of the French ju
diciary press, who had just held a
meeting on the subject and communi
cated the fact that no measures against
the foreign press would be taken or
were contemplated and that, should the
press be excluded from the courtroom.
French newspaper men would be treated
exactly the same as foreigners. The
meeting thereupon decided to treat the

BATES YET NEGOTIATES
WITH THE SULU SULTAN
' i Special Cable to The Call and the New York
â  Herald! Copyrighted, 1899, by James Gor
) don Bennett.
ILOILO. Philippine Islands. Aug. 13.â
J I have just returned to Iloilo after a
' l trip to Jolo, Mindanao and Cebu. Gen-
Meral Bates is still negotiating for a
' treaty with the Sultan of the Sulu
' Islands. The Sultan is as yet unwilling
;; to accept the terms offered by the
" '<â  Americans. He says that the Spaniards
) misrepresented to the world the nature
- ! of the treaty which he made with them,
) ; and he wishes to limit the Americans
to the occupation of the town of Jolo
i alone He claims the island of Siassi
and the town as his own. The Sultan
' '> seems not to have the support of his
-! chiefs, many of whom express friendly
i : sentiments toward the Americans. Yo
- kanine. the most powerful chief in the
- Sulu Islands, said in an Interview that
he was willing to force the Sultan to
i terms if he refused the American pr.op
l ositions. All th* chiefs complain of the
1 bad treatment the Sultan has given
I them. _.
. I The Chinese population oi Siassi,
I which was formerly held by the Span
, iards. but was given over by them to
' the Sultan-s men. are being squeezed
â¢ financially by a duty of 5 per cent on
! exports and imports. In an interview
â¢ the Chiese said it would be a most ex
-1 cellent change if the Americans were
1 substituted for their present rulers. The
1 : Sultan's Hag is now floating over
' Siassi The Sultan recently added
â  ! eighty rifles and a large store of am
' munition to his previous stock of three
hundred rifles.
1 A war between the controlling chiefs
1 ' among the Moros is more likely than is
a war with the Americans, provided we
do not interfere with their religion and
customs.
For the first time in its history white
people can travel about Sulu Island and
! among the Moros safely. 1 crossed the
island without a guard, through a wild
country to interview the Sultan at
; Maibun. He received me with courtecy
and gave me this signed statement:
"This certifies that his Highness Sul
tan Hadgi Mohamad Womolol Kiram.
is like a brother to the nation of Amer
icans and wants to know if they are
the same to him."
General Bates has shown great skill
in conciliating the native chiefs. Moro
chiefs of the island of Mindanao do not
! acknowledge allegiance to the Sultan of
Sulu. Dato, the chief mandi of Min
danao, came to visit Genera! Bates in
Jolo to assure him of his friendliness
toward the Americans.
On my trip to Mindanao T found the
'[ Moros friendly, but the towns of Zam
goango and Mercedes are held by insur
gents. They number 500 men and are
armed with rifles under their leader,
Alvarez, who stated to the commander
of the Castlne that he desired to be
neutral until the difficulty with Agui
naldo in Luzon was settled. If the lat
ter were beaten he would surrender.
In Tebu the insurgents still hold th<Mr
strong positions in th^ mountains. The
majority of the population do not want
to fight, but are hostile in spirit. A
native servant of an American officer
was caught by the insurgents and
! branded on the forehead with the word
"traitor."
In the case of Iloilo the insurgents
are intrenched about the nearby towns
Jaro and Molo. The rainy season pre
vents an active campaign, but consider
able fighting may be expected in the
fall. The rich natives have not returned
to their homes.
The island of Xegros is still unsettled.
General Hughes has sent extra troops
to suppress the uprising. The richer
class of natives are gradually return
ing to their homes.
TRICKY FILIPINOS
WITH FLAG OF TRUCE
MANILA. Aug. 14.â While the Seven
teenth Infantry, during last Tuesdays
battle, was approaching Oalulut along
the road, the troops saw a group of
fifty Filipinos outside the town under a
flag of truce. Some, who were in white.
clothing, held up their hands to signify
that they were unarmed.
Captain Hart, with a detachment, ad
vanced cautiously to a point within 200
yards of them, when the Filipinos
picked up their guns and fired a volley.
The Americans dropped into the bushes
unhurt on the first movement and re
turned the fire. At this the Filipinos
ran off.

States gunboat Yorktown. who, with

countered strong resistance among
the hills, the enemy firing from excel
lent positions. Having failed to con
nect with Major Cronin and seeing
that the town was already occupied
by rlie- Americans, Captain Rivers
withdrew, covering his withdrawal
by a heavy volley. He lost a sergeant
killed.
Captain Parker, on advancing,
found the enemy strongly intrenched
on the far side of some rice fields,
about a mile wide, and covered with
de< p mud. Pushing forward rapidly,
he routed the Filipinos, after forty
minutes' fighting, and then continued
the march upon San Mateo, which he
entered without serious resistance
;iliout half-past 1 in the afternoon.
.Major Cronin entered the town
about half past 4. The Americans
still occupy the place. The American
troops were exhausted by the heavy
marching.
This is the first action in which
Colonel Burt's colored troops have
participated. They behaved well,

BATTLE OF HOSTILE
FORCES OF FRANCE
Copyrights, ISM, by the Associated Press. !
RENNES, Aug. 13.â The battle has i
begun in earnest. Its political bearings j
nre shown in the arrest of Paul Derou- j
lecie, the Deputy and poet, and twenty- i
three of the numerous Royalists and
Bonapartist allies, who have pooled}
with him against the republic. As In j
the Bou.langist conspiracy, the pool ;
would be of little consequence but for j
the military caste, which has found
representative men in General de Ne
grier and some other generals having
great comma i
It is a strange thing how the fight \
thickened around the shadowy and j
emaciated red-haired Jew, whose uni- i
form of an artillery captain so ill fits J
and befits his figure and physiognomy. j
Last Monday's sitting of the court- |
martial and the subsequent non-public i
sittings were the first skirmishing I
operations, but yesterday was a field j
day in which the hostile forces, into
which France is divided and has been |
since the .revolution, set. themselves, in j
array of battle and drew the first blood, j
Each side stands committed to a cer
tain course and has burned its ships. |
The actual Dreyfus trial is a trial of j
strength. I cannot, see a possibility of j
its ending in a drawn game. It is now
a "neck or nothing" combat, a desper
ate fight in which neither side will give I
in unless utterly routed.
The moral situation of the forces en
gaged reminds one of that of the armies
of the French revolution and those they
had to fight. The Dreyfusites view the
brains, the forward impulse, the dash
and the flexibility. At the same time
they are raw recruits gathered sponta
neously from the four points of the
compass. Hatred of the military caste
and may be the secret hoi of re
wards have made them homogeneous.
The Nationalists have social and
other prestige, numbers and organiza
tion. Their center is composed of the
majority of Frenchmen and French
women; their left wing is formed of 22,
--000 officers and their right wing con
sists of the church. All profess re
spect for legality, but only from the lips j
out. One side is just as unscrupulous
as the other, but the most active and
less numerous side does really fight for
the cause of humanity, justice and ]
truth. The Dreyfusites have, at any |
rate, won belligerent rights and they j
are sure of the friendly neutrality of
the Government.
Their adversaries can no longer make j
use of the rope that hung Pickard, or
the razor that cut Henry's throat. The j
Minister of War could not, if he wanted
to, read a forged document in parlia
ment. It is Impossible now to stuff the
dossier with fables n't for Mother Goose
tales. Rut organization, numbers, pres
tige and wealth mean staying powers.
Doubtless the Dreyfusites are sup
plied with Jewish funds, without ac
cepting M. de Freyclnet'a estimate of j
29,000,000 francs. The ims subscribed
by English and Gorman JmvÂ§ must be
enormous, but like wealthy ' Gentile?,
the Jews are fund â â <- the-, pomps and
vanities of life, the titles of aristocratic
society. Many of them are frightened
already at the onward pace of the

But we have it now in print, it has;
qualities for which we did not give it
credit during delivery. They are easy,
flowing statements, showing plausibil- '
ity and the art of lulling suspicion. As
the deposition appears in full reports i
it will everywhere be read with delight
by those already persuaded that Drey

was Pecksnifflan, what was feline per
fidy, figuratively speaking. The depo
sition, which was really an argument
for the. prosecution, shows Mercier to
be a flautist of the highest order. He
never loses his way in the most intri
cate variations and keeps in view that
Dreyfus is a cool, calculating, well-in
formed traitor. /.

MERCER'S STATEMENT
BERLIN, Aug. 13.â The statements of ;
General Mercier before the court-mar

The general opinion is that the former i

THE SHERMAN'S COURSE FROM YOKOHAMA TO SAN FRANCISCO.
THE transport Sherman is now beginning to make an impression upon the miles of ocean that separate her from
San Francisco. At noon yesterday (San Francisco time) she had covered about 1365 nautical miles and should,
therefore be in the neighborhood of 3298 knots from this port. .
Cantain Barneson. superintendent of the transport service, said yÂ«iterday that he did not look for the

ANTI-SEMITES
UNDER ARREST
Demonstration Stopped
by Police.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PARIS, Aug. 13. â Demonstrations oc
curred this evening outside the offices
of the Anti-Semite League, where Jules
Guerin, president of the league, and-
Max Regis,, the. former Jew-baiting
j Mayor of Algiers, for whom orders of
arrest were issued yesterday on a
charge of conspiring to bring about a
change of " Government, : are still be
sieged by the police.
Fifty anti-Semites took up a position
opposite and M. Guerin harangued
them from a window. Finally the po
i lice closed the thoroughfare to prevent I
the demonstration becoming serious.
In the course of the evening M. God
frey, president of the committee of the
Jeunnesse Royalists, was arrested and
a dispatch from Saint Lee, capital of
the Department of Manche, announces
the arrest of M. Le Meunet, secretary
of the League of Patriots.
It appears that the report of the ar
rest of M. Mariel Habert, member of
{ the Chamber of Deputies for Etam
! bouillet, and a high official of the
I League of Patriots, was incorrect. He
is still at large. Out of thirty-seven
warrants issued, some twenty-five have
been executed.
M. Denys Cochin, monarchist and
: one of the deputies for the Seine de
partment, has written to the Premier,
M. Waldeek-Rousseau, announcing his
intention to interpellate, when Parlia
ment reassembles, regarding its gen
era! policy.
Those already arrested include:
Tonne de Sabran Pontes, Comte Chev

(â (.int.- Chevilly was a former friend of
the omte de Paris and is now a fervent
partisan of the Due d'Orleans. The situa
tion is believed to be less dangerous than
is pretended. The arrests serve to turn
attention from the Dreyfus affair, while
the seizure of the papers may enable the
Government to make further examples
j among the superior officers of the army.
A reporter of the Temps, who obtained
admission to the offices of the Anti-
Semite League; found the place a verit

twenty Winchester repeating rifles and

Special Dispatch to The Call.
.LONDON, Aug. 14.â The Johannesburg
correspondent of the Dally Mail says:
I "The Government, is awaiting the ap
; proval of the Orange Free State and the
Cape Colony Ministry before replying to
| the proposal of Mr. Chamberlain to sub
| mit the franchise controversy to a joint
commission of inquiry. I am in a position
to assert, that the first draft of the Trans
vaal's answer was a refusal. The Second
was an acceptance, conditional on the in
dependence of the South African republic
not being impugned.
"This dependence on Bloemfontein and
the Dutch Cabinet at Cape Town is proof
of the chaos reigning in Pretoria. The
leading members of the Raad are opposed
to war and accuse President Kruger of
being responsible for the crisis. More than
this, despite the war preparations, the
Transvaal generally is averse to a con
flict."
The Cape Town correspondent of the
Daily Chronicle says: "I am convinced
that the first shot fired in the Transvaal
would be the signal for a general native
rising. The imperial Government, I can
assert positively, has been warned ac
cordingly and is postponing the enforce
ment of the new Basuto hut tax.

On a question like this there should be
no dividing line between Democrats and:

that does not mean that I shall work for;

There are at present, however, no In

PORT TOWNSKNI). Aug. 13.â One
thousand dollars' worth of. gold dust from
the Cape Nome mining district was

great future for the country, owing to
the shortness of the mining bi i in,
which will not exceed four months, A

OKLAHOMA MAN
BUNKOS SWIFT
Chicago Packer Invests
in Scrub Cattle.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PERRY, O. T., Augr. 13.â 1t is reported
here that an Oklahoma cattleman
palmed off a gold brick on George B.
Swift of Chicago in Oklahoma some
-weeks ago. Swift came to the Territory
and inspected, as he thought, 12,000
head of fine cattle on the Klowa,
Apache and Comanche Indian reserva
tions. Later he made a big purchase
and leased a large tract of land >>n
which to graze his 12,000 cattle. He put
a competent territorial man to look
after the purchase, and soon the man
ager, so it is alleged, found that Swift
had purchased only 100 head of first
prrade cattle and the remainder of the
12,000 were nothing but ordinary scrub
stock.
It appears the agent who sold the cat
tle, who is said to \u- a man named
Williams, had the good stock so ar
ranged on the grazing pastures as t<>
deceive Swift, who paid a large price
f"r them. It is said Swift will soon
bring suit to recover several thousand
dollars from the agent who sold him
the cattle.^
HIS SERMON WAS
ON JESUS THE JEW
Rev. E. A. Woods spoke on "Jesus the
Jew" last night. A large congregation
filled the First Baptist Church to listen to
the stirring- address of the pastor. J>r.
Woods spoke in part as follows:
"Many of the great men of ancient and
modern times were Jews. Jesus was a
Jew. Was He something more? In a
sense all great men are the product of
their age and their environment. They
have their national characteristics. Plato
was a product of Greece; Caesar was i
true Roman; Gladstone was essentially an
Englishman, and Washington was tin- era.
Document nf the American spirit.
"But Jesus belongs in character to no
one nation or age. 11.- was manhood in
pi rfectlon. He had nor. the characteris
tics of a Jew. The world has crowned
Him as the idea! p< rfect man."
Two Homeless Children.
Two children, John and Joseph Gere,
I were lodged at the California-street Po
lice Station In a pitiful plight last night.
They had gone to their mother, who
spends her time in a. dive 011 Dupont
street, to pet the key to the woman's
room, at 127 Trenton street. She refused
to givp it to them. The luckless young
sters then searched for their father, find
ing him in a saloon. lie refused to have
anything to do with them. He had plenty
! of money to spend for drink, but none to
shelter his children.
Officers Fleming and Daggett took the
boys to the station. They will be doubt
less taken to some public institution to
day. Gere, who resides at 519 Jackson
street, has quarreled with his wife, and a
suit for divorce is pending between the
two.

from Captain Slamin of the revenue cut

of ?Attou Island were found by him in
straitened circumstances; but in no im- j

three men and titty women and children,

h The only fuel on the island is a scant j
supply of driftwood. The crew of the
Grant gave the people all their spare j
clothing. The people were also suffering i
from a lack of salt. This resulted In

clan of the Grant was kept busy dispens- j

inhabitants rations. They had a very good

SUSPICION RESTS ON
PRIVATE LLEWELLYN
He Is Believed to Be the Murderer
of the Two Denver
Policemen.
DENVER, Auk. 13.â The country for
miles around hero to-day swarmed with
detectives and policemen in search of the
poldier who. in the early hours this morn
ing, murdered Police Officers Tom < 'Mt
ford and W. E. Griffith while resisting
arrest. The two recruits who were with
the murderer at the time he shot Clifford
in cold blood, and were arrested shortly
afterward, have steadfastly refused to
give his name, denying any Knowledge ol
him except that he was a member of the
same company as they.
However, the police learned from other
members of the company who saw the
three men together during Saturday night
that the murderer's name is Wellington
C Llewellyn, and that he came from
Globe Ariz., a short time ago to enlist
in the new Thirty-fourth Regiment The
three men were all more or less Intoxi
cated at the time of the murder of < lll
ford and Llewellyn had 1 tl threatening
people with his gun. Clifford started to
arrest him and was killed. Later Llewel
lyn shot (Jrifnth. who was pursuing him.
A. reward has been offered for the body
of Llewellyn, deal or alive. There were
threats of lynching should he be caught,
but they are not very strung to-night.
CANADIAN BOATS

to Leave the Question
Open.
SEATTLE, Aug. 13.â recent seisure
of six Canadian fishing\boats near Point
Roberts by the United States customs
officials will probably be settled in a day
or so by the release of the boats.
The matter ha^i been the subject of
diplomatic discussion and was finally re
ferred to United States District Attorney
Wilson R. Gay by Attorney General
Griggs. Mr. Gay reported that the seizure
was made so close to the line and at a
time when it was possible to be deceived
in location, that It might be advisable to
release the boats. The Attorney General
wired him yesterday to proceed as he
thought best. Mr. Gay immediately
wrote Collector Iluestis, advising him to
let the boats go.

said:
"I cannot think Mr. Berry made the
statement attributed to him. In any
event. BUch a statement is an insult to
Kentucky and wholly without foundation
or excuse. Mr. Bryan would be in no
more danger in Kentucky than in any
other State in the Union.
Ex-Senator lilaekburn also discredited

STOCKTON, Aug. 13.â The v:> 11-known
river steamer Ellen and the barge Cricket
were knocked down under the hammer at
a receiver's sale yesterday afternoon to

merly owned by < laptain Al Williams and
was given by the courts to his divorced
wife, who later became insolvent. The
courts then appointed Giliis receiver of
the property. Giliis placed the boat in
commission in an effort to have her work
herself out of debt. Before this was ac
complished the Tinted States Inspectors
condemned the vessel and the court then
ordered her sold. When the boat is re
paired it will probably be put into the
service of the Union Transportation Com
pany.
THE SAN FKANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, AUGUST 14, 1899.
RAILWAY FOR THE
REDWOOD COUNTRY
New Line in Mendocino
County.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
TIBURON, Aug. IS.â President A. W.
Foster of the California Northwestern
Railway Company dispatched a large
surveying force last week to make a
working location through the redwood
section northeast of T'kiah, in Mendocino
County, with a view to beginning the
extension of the line northward. This
move on the part of the company marks j
the starting point of a new era for
Mendocino and Humboldt counties anil
will be hailed with joy by all the resi
dents of that section of the State.
The pans- is under the direction of Civil
Engineei Harlow, a well-known railroad
surv >yor, and the work will be pushed
with all dispatch. It is hoped everything
will be in shape for the letting of a con
tract toward tin- close of the year.
If the original Intention of the company,
as expressed by Prealde.nl Foster at a
mass-meeting of the citizens at I'kiah five
years ago is adhered to, the road will he
extended as far northward as Eureka, the
â¢>- seat of Humboiiit County.
Not only will the farmers and he mer
chants of Potter Valley, Round Valley
and the towns and villages of Humboldt
County living close to the proposed line be
greatly benefited, but the extension
means the development of great natural
resources.
A few years ago a ledge of coal was
â  red near Round Valley, which in
vestigation by experts showed to be a
vein extending from a mine of enormous
extent. Analysis of this coal showed that
it was of B superior quality and a syndi
cate t" work the mine was formed. When
ii was found Impracticable to extend the
line of 'he San Francisco and North
Pacific Railway northward at that Lme
an attempt was made to form a company
to build a line from Westport, on the
roast, to the coal fields. This project had
to be abandoned on account of the great.
natural obstacles to be overcome. From
that day to this little has been done, but
interest will revive as soon as the rail
way ( ompany is found to be In earnest.
In addition to the coal fields, the pro
posed line will tap a region of redwood
forests that will furnish a practically In
exhaustible supply of lumber. Much of
this is of the "curly" variety, so valu
able In ornamenting the interior of
houses and in the manufacture of furni
ture. ___^________

MUTINY HELPED TO
DELAY THE WARREN
The United States Steamer Left All Her
Firemen in Jail in Manila,
Filipino Coal-Passersâ The Transport Was Twice
Caught in Typhoons and Was Anxiously
Looked for by the Centennial's Crew.
THE United States transport War
ren, now out fourteen days from
Yokohama with the First Colo
rado Volunteers aboard, has
been having a lively time of it.
Before she got away from Manila there
was a mutiny in the engine room and
twenty-four of the firemen and coal
passers are now serving sentences of
from thrÂ°e months to a year in Bilibid
jail. After getting away from Manila
with a Filipino crew in the fireroom,
she was twice caught in a typhoon and
was given up for lost at Nagasaki.
The Warren left Manila four days
after the Centennial. The day after
she sailed a typhoon raged far forty
eight hours and the Warren must have
got the full benefit cf it. The day after
rHE TRANSPORT WARREN, BEARiNG COLORADO TROOPS.
the Centennial arrived at Nagasaki an
other typhoon developed and detained
her several days in port. There were
no signs of the "Warren and a British
tramp which reached port could throw
no light on her delay. The tramp and
the Warren sailed from Manila to
gether, and the Britisher was caught in
both typhoons. The captain reported no
sign of the Warren after the first day
out.
Upon sailing from Nagasaki CaptF.ln
Eagles kept a bright lookout for the
Warren, but saw no sign of her, and
I in consequence felt very anxious until
| informed yesterday morning by the
pilot that the Warren sailed from Yo
kohama on August 1 for San Francisco.
The firemen on the Centennial say
that the trouble on the Warren was all
caused by the engineers. They worked
a sick man until he nearly dropped
dead, and then because the rest of the
men objected they were arrested.
"It was just this way," said a fire
man yesterday. "The engineers were
down on the white men because they
wanted Chinese or Filipinos. One of
the men named Edwards was sick and
asked to be excused from work. The
second assistant said he was shamming,
and told him to go on with his work.
Edwards tried to work, but couldn't.
Nevertheless he was forced into the
nreroom. and then the men began to
object. The entire force of firemen and
coal passers went before the chief and
complained of the way Edwards was

firemen were in open revolt and the
engineers had to fly to their rooms and
lock themselves in. A force of soldiers
was sent out from the shore and twen
ty-four of the men were arrested. They
were all tried on a charge of mutiny.
The ringleaders got a year and the
others lighter sentences. None of them
were sentenced for less than three
months, so the Warren had to take a
Filipino crew in the fireroom when she
was ready to sail. They must have had
lots of fun keeping steam in the boilers
during the two typhoons the Warren,
was out in. I guess the engineers would
have been mighty glad to have had
those poor fellows in Bilibid prison
aboard again when the storm was at
its worst."
The people on the Centennial do not
think the Warren will get here before
next Thursday or Friday. They say
she will not be able to make her best
speed and will in consequence be a day
behind her schedule time.

Seventy-Five Pupils
Are Accepted.
ONE HUNDRED IS THE LIMIT
THE TEST FOR ADMITTANCE IS
VERY SEVERE.
Model School Will Be Established in
Two Weeksâ Parents Are Re
quested to File Applica
tions Immediately.
The San Francisco State Normal School
will open its session for the year 18W-ISUO
this morning at 9 o'clock in the building
formerly occupied by the City Isormal
School on Powell street, between Sacra
mento and Clay.
Dr Frederic Burke, president of the
school, announces that seventy-five pu
pils have been accepted. One hundred in
all will be enrolled, and there are still
over one hundred to be examined. The
test has been made rather severe, and
one of the conditions exacted by Dr.
Burke is that only applicants who have
been recommended by the principal of the
school from which they have graduated
"ill be admitted. It is calculated that
by drawing from those recommended
uroswective teachers of a superior intelli
gencewil be turned out. The enforce
ment of this rule has caused many dis
appointments, but will raise the standard
Â° The a appH e cants for entrance are largely
from this city. though several come from
Berkeley. Oakland, Alameda, Merced,
Marysvlle and as far south as Fresno.
Three or four young men will take the
course Applicants eligible for admission
without examination are graduates of
Schools accredited by the State Univer
sity who present the credentials i whlcn
admit them to the University. No stu
dert will be admitted after August 21. The
coCrse of instruction will be two years
for graduation. The diploma of gradua
tion entitles the holder to a grammar
grade certilicate in any city or county in
the State of California.
The faculty will for the present consist
of George Leslie, who will preside over
the science department; Miss Agnes
Stoweil. teacher ot English branrnes;
MiÂ«s Estelle Carpenter, instructress in
music Professors Cubberley and Brown
will deliver lectures on Saturdays.
The Model School will be established m
two or three weeks, and parents are re
quested to file applications immediately.
This school is not preparatory to the
Normal School, but is a distinct branch,
where the corresponding studies in ihe
grades of the public school are taught
for the purpose of practical illustration in
the art of teaching by the pupils of the
Ncrmal School.
It affords a fine opportunity for pupils
who have failed in their school examina
tions to receive the necessary help in or
der to regain their places next year. The
classes will be limited to ten or ilttcun I
pupils, and more time can therefore be
devoted to their education. The tuition
fee has been placed at $2 a month. There
are twelve applications on file, and the
number of pupils will be limited to one
hundred. ___^__^____
FILIPINOS AS ACROBATS.
The Troupe Gives a Private Exhibi
tion at the Mechanics' Pavilion
Which Proves a Success.
"The Filipinos are away behind us in
the art of fighting," said Secretary Cum
ming of the Mechanics' lnstitute yesterday
afternoon, "but as acrobats, jugglers and
ring performers generally they will hold
their own with any nationality on earth."
The remarks of the secretary were
called forth by the results of a private
exhibition given by the Filipinos in the
Mechanics' Pavilion yesterday afternoon
to the directors of the institute and their
friends, which was voted a complete suc
cess. There are about forty performers,
and although they had not been able to
do much exercise since June last they
gave a most creditable exhibition when
they got loosened up in their joints, and
by steady practice they will without doubt
create a sensation. The directors and
friends were delighted with the exhibition,
and think they have struck a gold mine
as an attraction at the coming fair.
The programme yesterday afternoon
was opened by a selection from the Fili
pino band. They don't know a note of
music and play entirely by ear. They are
quick to memorize a tune, however, and
showed it by playing the familiar "Hot
Time in the Old Town" without a hitch.
Then the whole troupe, with the excep
tion of Tlster, who is still suffering from
the effects of carbon-monoxide, filed into
the ring and did some high and lofty
tumbling. "Tod Sloan," a little Filipino,
and another youngster made a hit and
will be a drawing card. A woman did
some clever feats on the wire rope, in
cluding undressing and dressing on the
rope. Then followpd exhibitions (in the
Roman rings, juggling, pole balancing,
pyramids of chairs, horizontal bars ami
concluding with a pantomime, "The Doc
tor and His Patient." introducing the
clown and Columbine. The first public
performance will bo given Friday.
A clock is being constructed for
LiverpoolrStreet station in London.
The interior of its case could allow five
persons to dine comfortably.

BUSINESS STILL BRISK-
THERE is still no pause in trade worthy of note,
ugh there is a slight hesitation, as indicated i
by the hank clean: gs of the country, which
of 24.3 per cent last week, the smallest
increase for some time. There is, however, but little
g oil in the great cities, the gain at Chicago be
:ent, while all of the most important
- exhibit larger clearances than last year. New ;
York shows the most marked falling off, her gain last j
week being only 18.8 per cent over last year. De
creased trading in Wall street caused this decline, for;
doing very Httle speculation there at I
present, and the market has to depend on the regu
i, r professionals, most of whom are oft at the different
summer resorts.
kage in clearings is a shrinkage
in faili those! r the week being 136, against 196
ime week last ytar. Not for years have
mercial failures been so small and unimportant as
â  few months. This in itself is a signili
: of the remarkable prosperity of the coun
try.
Another very favorable indication is th<i volume of
â  crops, wheat ami corn. The Government
ts a yield of 500.000,000 bushels of win
ter and spring wheat, and a bumper crop of 2.001,
--500.000 bushels of corn, the latter being a record
breakeT. This cereal outlook of course affects the
great railroads, whose earnings during the coming
fail bid fair to show a marked increase. In fact,
1 ars are already becoming scarce in the East and
West, and the transportation companies will be put
to their trumps to move the vast output of the farms
of the West and Northwest.
The prominent staples keep' up their flattering ex
hibit, iron and steel of course leading. Western ad
are of heavy demand, scare* supplies of mate
rials, high price- and increasing volume of business I
i for next year. The production of pigirpn was
the largest ever known, but in spite of this stocks
showed a decrease and current production is easily at
rate of 14.000.000 tons- a year. Wool continues
.-'.rone, though as it is the season between clips the
market is not as active as it was some weeks ago.
Hides, leather, boots and shoes rule very firm, and
the manufacturers "have practically decided to advance
prices for the. litter. The demand for lumber shows
no abatement, and extensive canning operations have
greatly stimulated sugar. As for the canning trade
itself, it never was on a more brilliant footing. Most
of the California canners were sold up to their
capacity months ago, before the contracted fruit was
ripe, but of late a scarcity of cans has vexatiously
-retarded operations.
The local situation was enlivened toward the latter
part of the week by a rise in wheat, which though
fractional and on the very heels of a decline, was wel
come and made the street very cheerful. There is
nothing so stimulating to creneral trade as an advance
i-i wheat, and in an inverse ratio a decline in this
great staple always has a tendency to make merchants
cautious. No marked advance is expected, owing to
the favorable outlook for crops as a rule throughout
the world, but for some time the opinion has pre
vailed that wheat was > rather "lower than conditions
justified.
There is no slackening in the output of California
produce, which promises to be enormous this year.
The canners and driers are putting out immense quan
tities of fruit, which is meeting with an excellent de
mand at fine prices, owing to the shortage in the
and Europe. There is a stiff demand for new
hop?, but the growers will not sell, even at the good
prices bid by buyers. Cattle, sheep and hogs con
tinue high and wanted, provisions are in active de
mand, lumber is lively at the recent advances, a keen
inquiry for fall wool is expected by the trade, the
export trade of the coast was never livelier, and so it
goes all along the line, one unbroken exhibit of
prosperity.

DASTARDLY ATTACK ON T HE CITY.
T ptiE railroad company does not
want idle, desperate men running
around this city, and the citizens
of San Francisco do not want them.
1 â Extract jiom an address of the managing editor
\of the Examiner in reference to the returning
\ volunteers as reported vesterd.iv in the Examiner.
A writer tor the Examiner pleaded hysterically yes
| terday that somebody in California should do some
j thing "big"- in connection with the home-coming oi
\ the volunteers. The pleader asked for what he be-.
f lieved to be the impossible, something which would
, never be forgotten within the borders of the State
; and which would, in the memory of the nation, mark
California as the premier of States. The caslc of seem
ing impossibility has. in a single sentence, been ac
complished by the managing editor of the Examiner, j
This man has prostituted the patriotism of Americans
to gain a point in a petty quarrel for his employer.
He has outraged the sense of common decency
; which San Franciscans have always displayed. He has
; dishonored the State and has raised it to an evil
dignity of ill-fame because it harbors him and tolerates
the methods he represents. He has insulted the peo
ple of other States, and with a purpose baser than
that of him who barters his honor, has attempted to
brand the returning heroes of the Philippines as idle
I vagabonds, desperate characters, who come unwel
! come to the city and remain as feared and despised
malefactors.
With no other authority than his impudence, and
with no other criterion of decency than his own, he
speaks for the people of San Francisco and says that
; they do not want among them the brave men who
\ left their families and homes, their occupations and
'â  their ambitions to travel to the Southern seas to fight
for the nation's flag. It seems past belief that such
shameless effrontry could be shown even by the Ex
aminer, ready ever to betray a public interest and de
j base a private principle to serve its own selfish end.
but the proof is in the newspaper of which the man
aging editor is the authoritative head, and the motive
I is in the public's possession.
Not long ago the Examiner was deprived of its
; bribe money of $iooo a month by the Southern Pacific
! Company. The newspaper had become useless to de
! fend the corporation and harmless to injure it. The
! proprietor and his employe chafed under a sense of
| double injury. They felt as scoundrels whose scoun
drelism had been "made public. They have since lost
not a single opportunity to make reprisals. In tips
\ quarrel The Call is not concerned except where a pub
| lie interest is involved and where the people of thib
I city and State are to be made the victims of a
! dastardly misrepresentation which will do immeasur
! able harm.
When the managing editor of the Examiner says in
cowardly insinuation that the people of San Francisco
did not welcome the returning soldiers gladly he lies.
Tie speaks for himself and for his employer and in
their eyes is the vanishing glitter of a lost bribe.
When the managing editor of the Examiner declar-s
by blackguard implication that the citizens of this city
contributed their money and paid the tribute of their
praise to the volunteers in deceit he speaks the prin
ciple which has dominated his employer and the Ex
aminer in this community and he speaks for no one
else.
On Friday last the Examiner characterized the re
turning volunteers as worthy heroes. It suited the
Examiner then to call them so because a grudge
against General Shatter was to be satisfied. When a
bitterer spite was to be satisfied, when the double loss
of dishonest dollars and the sting of public shame were
to be revenged, worthy heroes became desperate, dan
gerous men.
But the Examiner has carried its despicable game
too far. It has made itself a public enemy. It has
attempted criminally, but in blind stupidity, to make
the people of the country and their returning heroes
the victims of its shameful scheme. In the face of
such an enemy the people of San Francisco have a
common cause. They are bound in duty to defend
themselves against an attack which would dishonor
their city in the view of all others and rob them of the
simple tribute of having done what their patriotism
dictated at a time when patriotism is the most sacred
virtue of a people who have given their dearest ones
as sacrifices to their nation's honor.
THE COMING AUTOMOBILE.
DISPATCHES from Washington announce that
the Government has been experimenting with
automobiles in the postoffice service and will
probably make extensive use of them in that city and
in Porto Rico. That is a curious combination. The
national capital and an outlying colony with a back
number civilization are to be made the scenes of
postal progress while the country at large is to be
kept waiting.
It would be impertinent, perhaps, to inquire why
the Government has decided to make its experiments
in Washington and a far-off island rather than in
San Francisco and Santa Clara Valley. There are
good reasons for the decision. Some time in the past
an automobile, under the highest patronage and with
the best auspices, started from New \ork for San
Francisco. The President and the Postmaster Gen
eral, as well as the rest of the country, have doubtless
been watching that experiment with close attention
and have learned from it so much that in undertak
ing experiments of their own they have thought it
best to begin operations on the smooth asphalt pave
ments of the capital or to try the country roads in a
remote island "far off amid the melancholy main."
The action of the Government will of course be
widely commended. It is well known the transconti
nental automobile is The Call's automobile, and the
people are always well pleased to see the Government
follow the leadership of The Call and profit by it.
Our automobile entered Ohio just before the
glorious primary elections of this city in which all the
bosses and the yellow journal were swept from' the
political horizon. In the uproar of that great event
the machine was lost sight of, but Ohio remains on
the map, and through the dawn's early light it can
be seen the machine is still there.
As there are women in Ohio with faces that have
been known to stop a freight train, some people may
suppose the automobile was stopped in that way.
Such a supposition would be erroneous. The self
propelling vehicle stopped in its own way. It is not
the first thing that has stuck on Ohio, and people
; shouldn't be too curious in such matters.
i In one respect the undertaking has been successful.
THE SAN FBJLBTCISCO CALL, 31OyMY, AUGUST 14, 1399.
It has verified the predictions of The Call. When the
automobile started The Call said the experiment
would test the mechanism and show where it is de
fective, and the results have been even so. There has
been revealed every defect in the machine from the
cylinders to the nut washers. It was said the trip
would test the country roads, and it has shown that
some roads are rough, some are mudoy and some
have ditches, and that the machine can break on the
rough" places, stick in the muddy places and run into
the ditches with the greatest facility. It was pointed
out that the appearance of the vehicle on rural roads
would prove whether people took an- interest in it and
whether cattle were scared of it, and so it did. It
was an object of more popular interest than a circus;
it was as startling to animals as a yellow journal freak
to humanity, and it once chased a cow for half a mile
and would have caught her if a valve hadn't broken.
â¢ The automobile is coming. It shall be in California
even as in Porto Rico. If the one now waiting for the
election processions in Ohio to pass do not reach
here in time for exhibition as a specimen of successful
mechanism at the Mechanics' Institute Fair, it will
still serve an exposition purpose. It will be hauled to
Chicago and placed. on a monument in front of the
Art Gallery of that city as the bust of the century.
OUR esteemed contemporary the Boston Her- i
aid devoted recently about a page of its space
to what is seemingly a tremendous sensation
in New England. The nature of the sensation was
well expressed in the headline: "Chinese Puzzle â Full j
Grown Celestials Pass as Boys â Find Fathers in Can- j
ada â Coolies Become -Merchants by a New Process â
The Exclusion Act Is Evaded â Revelations at Burl- I
ington, Vermont, During the Trials There."
From the vast array of facts spread forth over |
a page of closely printed matter, it is learned the bland
ainl child-like coolie has matched his unsophisticated ;
( (riental ingenuity against the shrewdness of the
Yankee in the Yankee's own home and has got the
better of him.
From the evidence given, it is clear there can be
no telling how many Chinese have managed to get i
into this country by the back door of New England. :
It is known now that hundreds who had no right to '
enter have not taken the trouble to smuggle them
selves in, but have walked up to the officers of the
Government and cleverly passed themselves off as i
American-born or as persons privileged under the
treaty.
It is noted that the cases most difficult to deal with
by the New England authorities are those of Chinese
claiming to have been born in the United States,
but educated in China. The thing that puzzles^ Boston I
is the fact that these natives have no difficulty in find
ing fathers in New England to vouch for them a-; his
children, pnd sometimes the father does not look
much older than the boy. Moreover, the number <<f
the natives is larger than seems quite right to New
England calculators. ;
The Herald says:
"It is noticed that the most of the boys coming j
in claim to have been born in San Francisco between ;
[875 and 1880. They do this because at that time there
was no adequate registry of births of Chinese in that
city. There could not have been more than 200
Chinese wives in that city during the years specified.
A birth rate of 50 boys a year would have been
abnormally large; yet in Vermont alone, for the five
years preceding this one, from 700 to 1000 alleged
native-born Chinese have been admitted, and the
number in the country is enormous."
The merchant dodge also is worked a way that
fatigues the Boston intellect. It is said:
"In Boston there are about 200 Chinese merchant*. !
and yet during 1897 and 1898 there were filed 3500
names of Chinamen alleged to be in business in Bos
ton. The method is this: A firm files a list of thirty
five partner?, and in the course of two years twenty
five will be admitted as returning partners. Logically
there should now be sixty partners, but as a matte r
of fact there are still thirty-five, but the names are all
new ones. When asked where the old partners have
gone, the reply is that they have sold oat and their
whereabouts is unknown. These new names remain
until they have served the purpose of unlawfully in
ducting some more Chinamen into the country, and
so the endless chain goes on."
Altogether the ingenuity of the little yellow man is
too much for the philanthropists. Even when they
know his tricks they cannot head him off. They
may know him to be lying when he claims to be i
native son of California or a merchant of Boston, but
they cannot catch him at it. He has his witnesses,
his certificate?, and everything else the officers de
mand, and it appears that ere long the New England
schoolteacher will not have to come to San Francisco
to see a Chinatown.
\A OST excellent is tlie suggestion of a cor
/ \ respondent that the programme of the theatri
* cal entertainment to be given for the benefit
of the volunteers' reception fund, be repeated at the
Grand Opera House. The plan has a double attrac
tion inasmuch as it will not only increase the revenue
to be derived from the entertainment, but will enable
persons who are not rich enough to compete in the
bidding for seats at the Orpheum to have a share in
the dramatic festival.
The details of the plan are given in our cor
respondent's letter published elsewhere, and need not
be repeated here. Suffice it to say the project is thor
oughly feasible. Mr. Morosco has offered the use of
the Grand Opera House, so there will be no difficulty
in that direction. For the actors and actresses to pass
from the one place to the other will be easy. Many
of them in the course of their careers have doubtless
made such double plays more than once, and it will
not be too much to ask them to repeat the perform
ance for the patriotic object in view.
It must be borne in mind the reception of the volun
teers is a movement in which all classes of citizens are
interested. Those who cannot afford to pay $50 or
even $5 for a seat at the benefit are just as patriotic
as those who can. State pride, national patriotism,
loyalty to the heroes of war and joy in their return
with victory, are feelings shared by all classes of citi
zens. It is right therefore that all should have a
chance to share in every undertaking set on foot for
the purpose of raising money for the reception.
Our correspondent is to be thanked for his sugges
tion. It is timely, pertinent, patriotic and popular.
It should be at once adopted and acted upon.
Mayor Phelan's position on the new tax levy seems
to be pretty well defined. He will stand sponsor for
all in it that is good and pass the buck to the Super
visors for the rest of it.
The authorities at Washington are now begging for
bread for the people for whom only a short time ago
there was a demand for bullets.
The Dominican insurgents are trying to hire Cuban
soldiers. There are some commodities not worth ac
cepting without cost much less buying.
BOSTON IS PUZZLED.
A GOOD SUGGESTION.
STATE MINING LAW.
MINERAL DISCOVERIES.
The news that because of a blunder in I
â the construction of the repealing act of
March 20, ISSQ; the State mining law of
I 1597 stands unrepealed will give the miners
and prospectors the biggest shaking up i
they .have received in a long time.
That the Legislature did not accom- ,
[â¢lish the repeal of the act of March 27,
is: 7. was early suspected or believed by
j a number of mining lawyers and mining
men, and several mining attorneys have
advised people to proceed under the State
law in making locations, but the discov
; cry did not become generally discussed or
, known, and miners proceeded according to
, old laws and forms all over the State, and
â  the announcement of the remarkable sit
uation in The Call of Saturday was prac
tically the first notice of their trouble the
, miners received.
After the adjournment of the Legisla
i ture 'the miners were much at sea re
garding the condition of the mining laws,
and the leading authorities appealed to
; â by hundreds of inquirers kept repeating
j that the situation was simply as it was
j before. the State law was passed, mining
j .locations being governed wholly by the
Federal, law and by district regulations,
where such had been made. Late In May
; last Attorney General Ford wrote an opin
i ion on the . situation' from this standpoint,
! which was published in The Call of May
28', and added the following:
"Note â appears to be a slight er
ror in the wording of the repealing act of
, 1599, the effect of which I have not con- |
i sidered. I have assumed in the foregoing
; that the act of 1897 was effectually re-
I pealed."
This was the first published intimation
that anything was wrong with 'the repeal
ing act, which few took the trouble to look
up, but it went" unheeded and the State
law was disregarded. it was on the as
â  sumption that the repeal had been effect
; ed that the executive committee of the
1 California Miners' Association a few
weeks ago decided to have prepared forms
' of location notices according to the Fed
eral law, for which there was much in
quiry by miners, and it was during the
preparation of these forms by Attorney
: A. H. Ricketts last week that the discov
ery which became effective was made.
After thorough study Mr. Ricketts decided
that there was no question about the
i State law being still in force, and other
eminent attorneys agreed with him. Three
or four days ago E. H. Benjamin, secre
tary of the California Miners' Associa
tion, sent notice of this conclusion to va
rious people, and then The Call made it
generally known.
As stated in The Call on Saturday, the
act appears in the statutes as follows:
Charter CXIII.â An act to repeal "An act
j prescribing the manner of locating mining
' claims upon the public domain of the United
i States, recording notices of local thereof,
amending defective locations and providing for
I the deposit of district records with County Re
i corders, and prescribing the effect to be given
to reoordaxion of notices of location and affi
davits," approved March 27. 18S7.
1 The people of the .State of California, repre
| sented in Senate and Assembly, do enact as
I I'olluws,:
Section Iâ An act to repeal "An act prescrib
, ing the manner of locating mining claims upon
the public domain of the United States, record
ing notices of location thereof, amending de
fective locations and providing for the deposit
of district records with County Recorders, and
prescribing the effect to be given to recordation
; of notices of location and affidavits," approved
March 27. ls'.-T, is hereby repealed.
Sec. 2â This act mi. til take effect immediately.
The title of the act is all right, but a
; moment's consideration of the construe
! tion of Section l reveals the error. The
trouble can be quickly understood by
omitting the matter in quotation marks
I and reading: "An act to repeal (an act,
etc.), approved March 27, iv<7. is hereby
repealed. This accomplishes nothing. It
! repeals "an act to repeal," and there was
Ino such act to be repealed. If the act
I had read: "An act entitled 'An act, etc.,
â¦ â¢ â¢' is hereby repealed," the end sought
would have been accomplish* d.
Secretary of State Curry has certified
to the Mining and Scientific Press that the
act as published in the statutes is a true
I copy of the original bill. The legal opin
-1 ions of Mr. Kick, and others to the
effect that as Section 1 expresses a precise
and clear meaning in saying "an act to
repeal, etc.", is hereby repealed," a court
cannot assume an intent different from
that so expressed, and cannot substitute
the intent expressed in the title for that
expressed in the act itself. The intent of
the Legislature is not for judicial in
quiry. When there Is no ambiguity the
error cannot be cured by a court, and the
Stale mining law was never repealed.
Attorney General Ford naturally de
clines to commit himself too definitely in
advance of official action, but was will
ing to say: "The repeal of the law of 1897
is extremely doubtful, and I strongly ad
vise miners to strictly observe the State
law."
If the State law has been continuously
In effect since March 27, 1597, no mining
location made since then otherwise than
in accordance with it is a valid one. If |
It is not a valid location legal possession j
cannot be maintained, and the claim is !
subject to relocation by any one. Very
few claims have been located according
to that law since the supposed repeal,
and with claims located less than sixty
days before the attempted repeal but few
holders properly completed the location
by tiling a second notice, an, affidavit of
$50 worth of work, etc.
Hundreds of miners and holders or
claims by bond or purchase will be In sad
predicaments, and there will be a great
amount of trouble and uncertainty for
a long time. There has been more pros
pecting and more claims taken up this
year than ever before. On one day re
cently fifty location notices were Hied
with the recorder of Shasta County.
Prospectors have this year penetrated in
great numbers into every part of the min
eral regions of Northern California and
swarmed along the Sierra Nevadas and
over the southern districts. The copper
boom has resulted in the location of a
large number of copper claims from Fres
no County north through .ill the north
ern counties. A large number of oil
claims help swell the list. Practically
all these claims located during the past
six months will be without legal protec
tion until the State law is complied with.
As under the State law $50 worth of work
is required within sixty days, it will be
impossible for the average holder of a
number of claims to save them all by
promptly relocating them, the tax on his
resources being too great. With the sup
posed disappearance of this requirement
many prospectors proceeded to stake out
claims as fast as they could find anything
to locate, having, they assumed, un
till the end of the year 1900 to do the $100
worth of assessment work required by
the Federal law. With the return of the
$."0 and sixty-day requirement a great
many of these claims will be simply aban
doned. Some miners are far from claims
they have located, and some will not learn
poon that they must hustle if they have
claims they want to save. It is to be re
gretted that the way seems legally open
for claim-jumping and the troubles that
would follow, for a claim cannot be held
unless properly located, and the State
law now discovered to be in force saya:
All locations of quartz or placer formations
or deposits hereafter made which do not con
form to the requirements of this act. in so far
as the same are respectively applicable there
to, shall be void. .
The only thing for claim holders to do
is to promptly relocate according to the
State law and do their assessment wo-k
within two months. The forms of notices
required by it must be again resorted to.
There will be a season of much doubt and
inquiry and a variety of complications
will arise all over the State. '.!.". %
It will be remembered that' the Stato
law requires a preliminary notice, as fol
lows:
Sec. â  2 â The discoverer of any vein or lode
shall immediately upon making a discovery
erect at the points of discovery a substantial
monument or mound of rocks and cost thereon
a Drelimlnnry notice which shall contain:
Firstâ The name of the lode or claim.
Secondâ The name of the locator or locators.
Thirdâ The date at discovery.
Fourthâ The number of lineal feet claimed in
lensfth along- the course of the vein each way
from the point of discovery.
Fifthâ The width claimed on each side of the
center of the vein. â  ; T -( '"'â â â  --.=
Sixthâ The general course of the vein or
lode as near as may be.
Seventhâ That such notice Is a first or pre
liminary notice.
This must be recorded with the County
Recorder within twenty days. Within
sixty days the discoverer must â¢do $50
worth of development .work, distinctly
mark the boundaries of the claim and
rile with the County Recorder a second
notice of location, which shall contain
the name of the locator, the date of dis
covery and of the posting of the prelimi
nary notice and "a description of the
I claim by boundaries and also by referÂ«Â»ncfl
to some natural object or permanent mon
ument-as will identify the claim."
There must be also filed an affidavit
1 that the $50 worth of work has been done.
Placer locations require two similar no- j
tices and $10 worth of work in sixty days. !
This law made a mining district record
made after March 27. 1897, of no legal
value and required the depositing of old
district records with 'the County Re
corder. The effect was a general disor- !
ganization of mining districts. Since the
supposed repeal of the law many mining |
districts have been reorganized and a j
number of district records have been re- I
turned -to districts. Now they must go ;
back to the County Recorder, though the )
recent records of locations in them have
no legal effect. The miners ofTuolumne '
County in convention at Sonora have or
ganized the whole county into a mining
district, adopted rules and regulations,
elected a recorder and prescribed a form i
of location notice, a!i of which, as in .
other districts, is of no effect.
Another discovery â¢of molybdenite in I
this State has been made, this time in
Ventura County. The following account, j
accompanied by samples of quartz rock
pronounced at the Minings-Bureau quite
rich in molybdenite, has been received by
The Call: â  .â¢ - -.Â»
L.EBEC, Kern County, Cal., Auk 7. 1899.
Editor Cad-Sir: Molybdenite has been dis
covered in the Gold Hill country. \entimi ,
County. For two or three years past the nun
ers and prospectors of this section nave been
troubled with a mineral supposed to be graph- j
ite, which does not occur in sufficiently large |
quantities to be of commercial value, ajia ow-
Ing to Its rebellious nature was considered a
nuisance. Investigation, however, has dis- i
closed the fact that the supposed graphite is
molybdenum. James McDonald, a miner who ;
knows mineral when he sees It. recently dis
covered such large . deposits of this metal in a
prospect he was opening up for gold on the
Alamo Mountain that he determined to ascer
tain Its true character and sent samples to a
Los Angeles metallurgist for analysis, with the
result stated. The report also shows a per
centage high enough to warrant a systematic
and thorough development of the ore body.
The mineral occurs in oxide, sulphide and car
bonate forms In a vein of Iron-stained quartz
six feet wide, inclosed between gray granite
walls, and has been traced about three miles j
along the line of strike. V. E. Fi Â«TS
Molybdenite is the chief ore of molyb
denum which has been classed as one of I
the "rare metals," though its occurrences j
are numerous. It has been found In many
places through the Eastern States and
in the western mineral regions. Including
California. It has been reported several,
times from Fresno and Kern .counties, I
and has been found elsewhere and has i
several times excited the interest and in- ;
quiry of prospectors who thought they i
had made valuable finds. It is found in ;
quartz granite and other rocks, generally j
in thin, irregular layers, and composing
but a very slight percentage of the rock.
It is easily mistaken for graphite, being
similarly soft and producing a similar
mark when rubbed on the lingers, but it i
may be distinguished by its bluish gray
cast, while graphite is black. Malybde- j
num is chiefly used in hardening and
toughening steel, for which purpose it is
substituted for tungsten, and for making i
a blue coloring for porcelain. So small
a quantity is demanded that the world is
practically supplied by one mine in Swe
den at about 90 cents per pound. It Is
best obtained from the ore in an electric
furnace. The supply is abundant -when
ever it is demanded. The Ventura j
County discovery would thus appear |
more interesting than commercially im- ;
portant. In auriferous quartz, malyb
denite interferes with amalgamation and
would hence be troublesome in working
the ore for gold.
California's first talc mine has been
opened in Ventura County by S. S. Simon
and talc is for the first time being pro
duced commercially in this State. Talc
is found abundantly all through the State
but rarely of sufficient whiteness and
purity to be of any commercial value. It
is largely demanded for the manufacture
of paper and for other uses, and It is ex
tensively produced in the East.

PACIFIC COAST SURVEY.
Superintendent of the Service
Tells of the Work Done.
The main work of the survey consists
in the preparation of coast charts. At
present charts of California, Oregon and
Washington coasts have been carried to
a good deal of accuracy, but In Alaska
the survey is meeting the most difficult
problem it has yet to face in the 100 years
of its history. In Alaska are 20,00") miles
of uncharted coast. Navigation is still
further hindered by fogs. Until the last
five years but little need had been felt
for accurate charts of this region, but
within that time an enormous commerce
PROFESSOR H. S. PRITCHETT.
has sprung up in Alaskan waters and
every effort is being made to survey the
harbors and bays of the Alaskan coast
line. During the present season the sur
vey has five vessels at work in Alaskan
waters. Three of these are at work in
the neighborhood of the Yukon delta.
Into which stream an entrance from the
ocean Is being sought. Surveys of Cape
Nome and Golovim Bay are also being
made. Another party is at work in
Prince William Sound, and during the
paÃt season the territory about the head
of the Lynn Canal, and which Is in
volved in* the boundary dispute, has been
surveyed and the information furnished
to the Department of State. At present
the most pressing need for surveys la
felt in regard to Prince William Sound
and Cooks Inlet and the passes through
the Aleutian Islands.
During the coming winter the survey
of the coast of Hawaii will be begun.
Congress has also authorized the begin
ning of surveys in the Philippines, but
this work will doubtless waft the pacifica
tion and gradual development of the is
lands.
Besides these great general lines of
work which the survey is pushing, the
following pieces of work are of special
interest to San Francisco and California:
1. The erection of a tidal indicator on
Alcatraz Island.
An automatic tidal indicator is in pro
cess of construction which will be erected
on Alcatraz Island within a few months.
This apparatus, by means of a large disk
over which an arm moves, will show to
the shipping in the harbor the exact
height of the tide and also whether it is
rising or falling, information of the
utmost value to the shipping.
2. The erection of an observatory at
T'kinh for determination of the variation
of latitude.
This work is carried on by the Coast
Survey for the International Geodetic As
sociation. This association was formed
a few years ago by about twenty of the
leading nations of the earth for a co
operative study of the size and figure of
the earth and of other geodetic prob
lems. Among these problems, and onÂ»
very recently brought to the attention of
geometers, is the phenomenon known as
the variation of latitude. It is found that
thin variation Is due to th* fact that the
earth's axis instead of being fixed a* the
earth travels through â pace, has a Flight
wobble bo to apeak. This displacement
may throw the, earth's axis as much a*
fifty feel away from the plane it would
occupy if fixed, and consequently change
the latitude by this amount. In order to
completely determine the amount of thlr
chTnce and Its period the Internationa^
association has established six obserya

NEWS OF FOREIGN NAVIES.
Coaling at sea receives much attention,
in foreign navies. The international
squadron at Crete had a competitive test
In which the British came out aw;->
--nhead. The French took in thirty to forty
tone an hour, the Italians twenty tons, the
Germans, Austrians and Russians aver
aged about ten tons, while the British
took in their coal at a little over a hun
dred tons per hour.
At the recent meeting of the Institution
of Naval Architects in London, a paper
was read from Chief Engineer Melvilbi
relating to the triple-screw system and
strongly advocating its extension. In
discussing the paper read Sir White, direc
tor of naval construction in the British
navy, declined to enter into any critical
analysis of the unreliable proposition,
saying that he was anxious to keep an
open mind on all subjects, but that Mr.
Melville's paper contained but a few
facts, a great many opinions, not a few
speculations and some arguments."
The French Ministry of Marine finds it
self in a predicament such as is unparal
leled in any other navy. The sea-groin?
officers are averse to shore duty and its
attendant sedentary occupations, and
prefer to be either unemployed or to go to
.st-a. As a consequence orders have twen
issued that hereafter officers must taka
their turn of shore duty for a certain un
interrupted period, and no excuse will be
accepted to escape office work in the sev
eral departments or at yards. There is no
such objection in our navy against shore
duty, and such officers as have declined
duty at Washington are phenomena.
With the new scale of pay there is. on
the contrary, likely to be a scramble for
shore duty, as the pay in some grades is
now actually less white at tea than on
shore. No such inducement exists In ir.y
other navy to forego sea service and ac
cept the monotony of three years" shore
duty.

DEDICATED BY
THE ARCHBISHOP
The Ceremonies atthe
Church.
AN IMMENSE THRONG ATTENDS
AN ABLE SERMON BY BISHOP
MONTGOMERY.
Beautiful Music Rendered by an Aug
mented Choir â Kind Words for
Pastor and Congrega
tion.
His Grace, the Most Rev. Archbishop
TUordan, In the name of God yesterday
received the handsome edifice erected for
the Holy Cross Church from the hands of
the faithful by whose piety and generos
ity it was built, and solemnly dedicated it
to the exclusive purposes of divine wor
ship. Henceforth the structure is with
drawn from profane use and, in the em-
Iphatic- language of the Scriptures. It be
comes a "house of God."
The ceremonies attending the dedication
â¢ â â¢: Holy Cross 1 new home were impressive
and beautiful. There was not a person
within the walls of the sacred edifice who
was not awed by the solemnity of the
occasion. The Archbishop, robed In full
canonicals and attended by deacons of
honor, was present, as were also the
bishops of the northern and souther] sec
tions of the State, tog-ether with many
priests from the various parishes in this
City and vicinity. Acolytes attired in red
cassocks to the number of twenty par
ticipated in the services, and their cos
tumes, in contrast with the austere garb
of the priests, had a striking effect.
Had the church been twice its size it
could hardly have held the crowd which
eagerly tried to gain admittance. With
wise forethought the pastor and his as
sistants issued cards of admission to the
members of the parish, and these magic
boards opened the way to a seat.
Those unable to gain admittance content
ed themselves with standing in the vesti
bule for hours.
The services opened promptly at 10:30
a. m. with an organ prelude. The
Archbishop, preceded by the acolytes
bearing lighted candles, officials of the !
mass and the visiting priests, entered the !
chancel and began the ceremony of dedi-
I cation Accompanied by the officiating
clergymen his Grace first proceeded down j
the center aisle to the front of the church, ;
and as those In the procession gathered !
around him he sprinkled holy water on j
the doors and walls, accompanying the
action with appropriate prayers.
On returning to the altar the litany was
chanted, and again the. procession moved ;
with solemn tread through the aisles of !
the church, the Archbishop sprinkling the ,
walls of the church while the deacons of .
honor alternately read prayers from the
service of dedication. On the return to ;
the chancel the celebration of the mass ;
commenced. Rev. E. A. Kelly of Chicago, ,
a classmate of Father John F. McGinty, j
was the celebrant of the mass; Rev. John j
E. Cottle of St. Brigid's, deacon; Rev. ,
John P. Coyle of the Star of the Sea, sub- :
deacon; Rev. P. E. Mulligan, master of i
ceremonies, and Rev. R. Sampson, assist
ant master of ceremonies. Gounod's |
"Grand Messe Solenelle" was rendered by
the choir during the mass. At the con- !
elusion A)f the solemn high mass Father '
McGinty made a few announcements, and
was followed by Rt. Rev. Bishop Mont
gomery, who preached In his usual elo- !
quent style. He spoke in part as follows:
And Jesus told to them, go, therefore,
into th- whole world and teach the gospel
to every creature. He that belleveth and
Is baptized . hall be saved; he that be
lieveth not shall be condemned. Having
piven the text he addressed himself to the
Archbishop, Bishop, reverend gentlemen
and the brethren as follows: '"It Is my
happy privilege to-day to congratulate the
pastor and the people of Holy Cross parish
on the completion of this magnificent
church and Its solemn dedication to the
service of Almighty God. Henceforth it â 
will stand as a monument of the faith, the
zeal and the piety of both pastor and peo
ple. Whilst is a true that the dedication of
a house of worship in an active and grow
ing population la not a matter of rare
occurrence, nevertheless it always brings
to our mind the mission and the work of
the church as an institution. We learn
when very young in our catechisms that the
â work of the church Is to teach, sanctify and
save souls. The work of the church ie ever
the same. Her object Is to teach the truths
of God and apply them to the souls of men
and pave them."
The speaker then told of the obstacles, dif
ficulties, and temptations in the way of such
teaching.
At the offertory "O Cor Amoris" was
rendered by Miss Lilly Roeder and Miss >
Ella V McCloskyn. The Archbishop con
cluded the services by giving the pontifi- i
cal blessing. While standing on his throne
he delivered the following words to the
congregation:
I would like to pay one word before we
leave this beautiful church. I desire to
extend first my congratulations to the rev
erend pastor of the parish and then to his
devoted parishioners my heartfelt congratu
lations on the completion of this great
work begun but a few months ago for the
honor and glory of God, and to-day dedi
cated to divine worship.
It is not an â  easy matter to build a
church like this. I can speak from ex
perience. The nights of anxiety, the days
of labor, the going about securing aid is
not congenial, and yet your pastor has done
it successfully and quickly, and has done
It because you were impressed with the
need of a church. And to him first of all
congratulation and to you who aided him
my heartfelt congratulations.
The Archbishop was attended by i
fathers Lagan and Frieden as deacons of '
honor. Bishop Montgomery had Fathers
Vlebert and Sardi as deacons of honor, j
and Bishop Grace of Sacramento, Fathers ;
Pius Murphy and D. O. Crowley. Among
the priests in the sanctuary were: Fathers i
Dempsey, Cummlnes. Culligan, Santan- j

SERVICES IN MEMORIAM.
Pastor and Laymen of Simpson Me
morial Church Tell of Good Deeds
of the Late Captain Goodall.
Special services were held at Simpson
: Memorial Church yesterday in memory
of the late Captain Charles Goodall, who
was one of the most prominent members
of the congregation. Addresses were de
; livered by the Rev. John Stephens, the
: pastor; Dr. Nelson J. Bird, I. J. Truman,
William Abbott and others. Dr. Bird,
' who has been associated with Captain
i Goodall in church work for many year: ,
spoke eloquently of the worth and Chrls
â  tianity of decedent. He said in part:
"My intimate relations with Captain
â¢ Goodall fur many years makes his death a

until we follow the widening diamel
: the inspiration of his character upon the

J. F. Spitz Lost His Watch.
F. J. Deford, a dishwasher, was booked
at the City Prison early yesterday morn
ing by Policemen O'Meara and Callahan
on a charge of grand larceny. About 4
o'clock the officers were notified that a
man was "rolling a drunk" on Mission
street, and they saw Deford walking
away from a man who was stretched out
on the sidewalk. They arrested D<
Whfr searched nothing was found in his

Blood Poisoning Causes Death.
M. M. McGregor, a farmer residing
near Modesto, died at the French Hos
pital in this* city Saturday evening from
blood poisoning. McGregor was caught in
a thrashing machine and had his ri; m
hand badly lacerated. He came to this
city a few days ago for medical treat
ment, and the doctors at the hospital
told him that it would be necessary to
amputate the member in order t<> pre
serve his life. To this proposition Mc-
Gregor objected and soon the fatal blood
poisoning set in.

THE SAX FRAK CISCO CALL, MONDAY. AUGUST 14, 1899.
THE TRANSPORT
CENTENNIAL IN
GREAT DANCER
Went on a Coral Reef
Near Manila.
CARGO HAD TO BE JETTISONED
FILIPINOS TRIED TO CAPTURE
THE STEAMER.
One of the Centennial's Crew Killed.
Sick and Wounded Soldiers
Came Home on the
Transport.
The Tnited States transport Centennial
arrived from Manila yesterday morning
after a most exciting round trip. S â¢
I narrowly escaped a couple 6f typhoons,
was ashore on a coral reef and the en
tin crew barelj escaped capture at the
hands of the Filipinos; one of the sailors
siiled by a parting hawser and one
of thf quartermasters was stabbed by a
colored cook. In spite of all these inci
both officers and men are well sat
isfied with their ship, and all of them are
eager to go out on her again when she
sails for the Philippines.
The Centennial left here in May last
with a valuable cargo of supplies for Gen- i
oral Otis. While rounding the north end
of the Island of Luzon she struck on a
Bunken reef off Point Engano and stuck
there hard and fast for fourteen hours.
Filipinos in bancas and canoes put off
from the mainland and hovered around
the steamer. Some of them ranged along- i
side, but Captain Eagles ordered them '
away, and when some of his men ap- '
I armed with rifles the Filipinos
Sheered Off.
Soon after this a hand of mounted rebels
arrived on the beach. They sent word to
Captain Eagles that in the morning they
would bring a thousand men from the In
terior to help to get the vessel off. AH
this time the engines of the Centennial
had been going full speed astern, but they
failed to budge the transport. Captain
Eagles, seeing that if hr- waited for high
water an armed band of Filipinos would
swoop down on him. began to jettison the
cargo. Machinery, saddles and bridles,
canned beef, cases of hardtack, canned
fruit, salmon and other supplies were
dropped overboard. In all, goods valued
at over $13,000 were thrown out. and the
pile was almost out of the water when the
ship floated oft' the ledge.
"We were all badly scared, I can tell
you," said one of the officers yesterday.
"Captain Eaglea told us that if we did
not get the vessel off the Filipinos would
Joot the cargo and every one of us would
be made prisoners or killed. While we
were hoisting the cargo over the side the
Filipinos increased in number and became
more and more venturesome, as they
thought we would be unable to get off.
Tlkti- were Indications of their not wait
ing for the help that was coming from
the interior, and once or twice I made
sure they were going to board us. Finally
Second Assistant Engineer Gottlob and
Third Assistant Carr got a kedge out over
the stern and we managed to warp the
Centennial out Into deep water. We were
none too soon, either, i can tell you, for
just as we got the steamer under way
the 'promised assistance 1 arrived. It con
sisted of about a thousand armed rebels,
and it would have been all day with us
if we had still been on that coral reef."
The Centennial reached Manila without
any mishap after that. On her arrival
divers were Bent down, who reported that
part of the keel was gone but the vessel
was not otherwise damaged. She will pro
on the drydock here for an overhauling,
and before sailing again for the Philip
pines will have new boilers put In.
Charles Jackson, one of the crew of the
Centennial, was brought here in irons.
lie is charged with stabbing Quartermas
ter Herman Brevy. From what the men
on the transport say Brevy was the ag
gressor. He called Jackson names and be
pan to punch him. Jackson then pulled a
I sheath-knife and plunged It into ISrevy's
abdomen. The wounded man was taken
; to St. Bernard's Hospital, at Nagasaki,
where he lay in a precarious condition
when the Centennial sailed. On the ar
rival of the transport Jackson was handed
over to the harbor police, who will turn
him over to the United States Marshal to
i day.
One of the Centennial's crev* was killed
| at Manila by a parting hawser, and a sol
' dier was nearly swept overboard. There
was a terrific strain on the cable as the
' ship was swinging to it. Captain Eagles
warned the soldier and Quartermaster
Hanson to seek a place of safety. Neither
man heeded the warning, and just as the
rope slipped out of the "chock" the mate
grabbed the soldier and saved him. The
sailor was struck by the rope, and his
arms and legs were broken. He also re
ceived internal injuries from which he
died In a couple of hours. The Centennial

The Centennial was thirty-two days

from Nagasaki. She sailed from Manila
just after a typhoon had been raging, and
reached Nagasaki immediately before one
broke out. The transport behaved well
throughout the trip, and her officers all
sing her praises. They say that any other
I steamer would have been pounded to
pieces on the coral reef at Point Engano,
while the Centennial escaped with a few
dented plates and the loss of a portion
of her keel. __

Crowds Were Small Owing to the
Threatening Weather.
The threatening weather kept many
people indoors y< sterday, and as a natural
result the crowd- at the park, beach and
other pleasure places were small. No ac

was fortunate, as the Park Emergency
Hospital still remains closed. At the

COURSING v
UMPIRE LONG
AND BORCHERS
IN WORDY WAR
San Jose Retires in
the Sixth.
DUDFS LOSE BOTH MATCHES
VERY FINE ORDEB. OF BALL
AT RECREATION PARK.
In the Morning a Pyrotechnic Show
Was Paraded Under the Name
of Baseball When Steffani
: : ..;â  Was "Found.''
San Jose Oakland 2.
"Ho called me something which my
honor could not brook," said Mr. Long,
umpire, "and that is why I ordered him
cut of the game." Borchers, the bad man
in question, went and so did the rest of
the runepickers, but they came back
without him and the game continued
after a delay of a long 10 minutes. Mr.
Borders' defense verbatim Is as follows:
''I simply used the name of a very goou
person with a word or two attached and
that is why he. fired me. That guy can't
tell a strike from a hall when he's awake.
Tho diamond sparkles too much for him
ami breaks his sight. "
All this happened in the sixth inning
in the game between San Jose, and Oak
land at Recreation Park yesterday after
noon. The score was two apiece and the
men playing hard. Mr. Borchers, the
Prunepicker twirler, did not like the de
. cisior.s of Mr. Long and he indulged in
a running soliloquy which was heard, by
Mr. lMng. Hutchinson was at the bat
fur the Dudes. and he hit to ODea, who
threw fast to rst. The umpire gave the
customary hand signal for "you're out"
but soon changed his mind and called
Hutch safe. Then it was that the artist's
â  model, whose pet name is "Which," said
a fow uncomplimentary things about Mr.
Long and the latter retaliated. The
storm that had been brewing in Mr.
Lung's chest broke out with volcanic
force. Lachrymose McGucken began to
weep -.-. Ken his pitcher was ordered off
tthe rield and he i ailed the rest of the team
to the benches.
Fur a ;imf it looked as if the game
. would be ended at once. Doc McGraw re
. lented at last and Hanlon was put in the
' box. Long's decisions were very much
.'like a piece of moth-eaten fringe and
..there were all kinds of unmentionable
tilings said about him. In Borchers' case
he was obdurate and the Czar finally
triumphed* President Moran upholding
him for the determined stand he took.
Thg latter said the dignity of the game
â  must be sustained, anil it was.
'. The game itself was a fine exhibition
t'oti ballâ just enough ttir.g to please the
.' cranks and but few errors to call for
jcomparisons with bewhiskered spheroids.
Ip to the ninth inning a tie congested the
..-.â¢-cure, but at the very last stroke San
â¢Juse found Mr. Moskiman for a couple
:<if hits and Anderson scored the winning
run. Anderson began the twirling for San
;Jose, but he was discovered early in the
â  game and Borchers was substituted.
â  When the latter was ejected Hanlon was
â â¢placed in the box and hid pitching was
a feature of the three last innings.
â¢â¢ In the beginning â¢ the Prunepickers
'.Started the, ball rolling. HcGTicken
â¢ whacked the ball for a single and made
'second by an erorr of judgment on the
.'part Hi" Hutchlnsonl who ridded a hot
|grounder from Graham's bat. Hutchin
son was four feel : rom first, but he
threw to second, with the result that
neither man died. Borchers In a two
tliaggvr streak forced Mcl Â»ucki over the :
plate and Graham soon followed on a
single by Texas Huston. The third inning :
ta.w the Dudes two runs. A beautiful '
three-bagger by Schmeer followed by a
hit from Donovan's stick sent the former
home. Donovan stole second, and Mr.
Moskiman; who was waiting for some
thing to come his way. rapped out a two
bagger; Donovan gliding over the plate.
vVhen the ninth inning was reached Joe
Stapleton began to sigh, for he feared a
ten-inning game. His fears were dashed
and Joe was made happy. Anderson
swattte'd a two-bagger and, clung tt>
second until Kent hit the ball to center,
when he sprinted like the wind and scored
the winning run of the game. Score:
OAKLAND.

This is what happened in the morning
game at Freeman's grounds. The game
belonged to the swells at the end of the
sixth Inning. Then Mike Steffani was
unraveled and a fireworks show was the
..results In the seventh inning the ball
i-was ever busy, anil it .was in use a long
time. The Prunepickers simply reveled
in base running and sky scraping, both of
which pastimes were funerals for the
Oakland crowd. Every man on the San
Jose warn had a chance and many of
them a second one in this eventful
iniung. But that is not all, for in the
very next try for- score-building San Jose
nearly repeated the performance, amass
ing five runs before the game was called
ut the end of the eighth.
To learn the character of the game all
that is necessary is to run the eye over
the summary. In the fifth Borchers put
th<- ball over the left field, fence, but the
noxt time he came to the plate SteffanJ
struck him out. When the shower of hits
was falling on the Dudes ODea, for mere
diversion; worked oil another "homer" on
the home team. Three-baggers and
doubles were simply ordinary things and
called for little applause. Mr. L.ang<? re
lieved Steffani in the eighth. The score:
OAKLAND.

WATSON VI I-LiE, Aug. 13.â 1n the pres
ence of one of the largest crowds at Por
ter's Park this season the Watsonville
baseball club defeated the Santa Cruz
team this afternoon by a score of 8 to 3.
The visiting club was cheered on by a
large delegation of Santa Cruz fans, but
their efforts were futile against the bril
liant pitching of George Harper and the
excellent team work of. the Watsonvillans.
There were times when it locked as if
Santa Cruz would fatten its score, but
the cleverness of Harper and the sharp
work of the fielders cut off the chances
for hit:- and runs. Ed Daubenbis was in
the box for the Beachcombers, and though
he was found often he was ; not entirely
sponsible for the loss of the game. Score:

SOME EXCITING SPORT
AT INGLESIDE PARK
The short end players among the big
crowd at Ingleside Coursiu^ Park laid
away vexy little coin yesterday. The
smart ones were in rare form, picking
the winner on all but nine occasions. The
result of the big forty-eight dog stake
was, however, a mild surprise, H. A.
Deckelman's Rocker capturing the long
end of the prize. Wild Tralee, the much
ly touted one. met with a piece of hard
luck at the last moment. In the fifth
round, haiving drawn a bye, the black dog,
ruling favorite, was pitted against Ski.
The hare slipped was a particularly elu
sive one, and in a long, killing comrse
Tralee mÂ«t defeat. He ws.s "all out" and

NEWPORT, R. 1., Augr. 13.â 1f it were
â not for the fact that both the Columbia
ami the Defender have entered the race
to-mprrow for the Astor cups the events
would be almost featureless, for to-night
out of a net of over sixty sailing craftâ
sl.xjps and schoonersâ only six- yachts.
three .:f each, have signified their inten
tion to enter the race. Still the race' will
be watched by a great crowd of yachts
men, and will undoubtedly be as interest
ing as those in years gone by. A victory
(or th> Columbia is on the card, and over
a. course of thirty-eight miles a lead of
five or six minutes would satisfy every I
one. The contest called this year for the
second time the Astor cup race, was in
stituted many years ago by Ugden Goelet,
who offered two cv**Â« one. for schooners
and another {of sloops. John Jacob As
tor came promptly forward two years ago,
after the death of Mr. Goelet, and offfered
cups, thut the race might be perpetuated.
There should certainly be a good race
to-morrow, not only between the two bi^
fliers, b.ut In the schooper class between
the Colonia, Amorlta and Quizetta.
The club has two courses for the race,
depending, at course, on the wind. In
both cases the yachts will start and fin
ish at Krenton's Keef lightship, and each
course is thirty-eight miles long.
The stan will be made at 10:30. the
Bloops betng sent away first, the schooners
following ftve minutes later. The yachts
will sail with time allowance, and there
Is no limit on the race. On Tuesoay the
wind cups will be contested i"'>r. the Co
lumbia and Defender also sailing, and on
Wednesday, after the Owl and Gamecock
colors have been fought f>>r by the crews
of the fleet, the squadron will disband.

and a Jolly Aftarnoon.
The Corinthians enjoyed a successful
clambake at Tiburon yesterday. Early in
the morning a great pile of clams, ears of
corn and pieces of chicken had been pre

before the hungry yachtsmen. Qeorge

ments, was complimented on all sides.
After luncheon a reception committee of
lifty or more, with Prank Thompson as
leader and Douglas ErsKine as standard
bearer, marched down to the depot to
welcome the band of Sequoia Parlor, Na
tive Sons of the Golden West.
Among the old-time yachtsmen and hon
orary members who were present were
I'ncie George Bromley and Charles G.

acteristically happy speeches, which was
enthusiastically received. Maurice Cra
mer presided at the piano, and Frank
Thompson. Cathcart and Ryan sang
"Doc" Emmons recited, and others
'"obliged the company."
The entire fleet of the Corinthians lay at
anchor in the cove, augmented by the
schooners Azalene and Bonita, the yawl

others. Among the guests were G. T. S

FINALLY WORSTED
The baseball game yesterday between
1 teams of the Nebraska volunteers and
the Union Iron Works at the Mechanics'
Institute grounds. Sixteenth and Folsom
streets, was won by the latter by a score
of 20 to 9.
The workers in steel and iron proved too
skillful fur the tall Nebraskans. although
the game put up by the soldiers was a
strong one until the sixth inning. A crowd
over 1000 strong was present and enjoyed a
good afternoon's sport, at the same time
contributing their share to the entertain
ment fund for the California boys. The
receipts could not be accurately ascer
tained yesterday, but will amount to more,
than $100.
Private Grayson. the Nebraska volun
teer who fired the first shot of the war
with the Filipinos, did his best to cheer
his comrades on to victory; but Delmas of
the Union Iron Works team received a
mascot in the second inning that did the
work and hoodooed the Nebraskans. The
mascot in question was a large cabbage,
with Which Uelmas was presented by his
admirers amid the plaudits of the crowd.
The score stood 7 to 7 at the close of
the fifth inning, but in the sixth the local j
team forged rapidly ahead, and when the |
last out was made it stood 20 to 9 in their
favor. The pitching of Shuman of the Ne
braska? and the three-base hits by Bulger
and Crawford of the Union Works were
the noticeable features of the game. The
teams lined up as follows:
Nebrapkaa. Positions. Union I. Wks.

THE MUNICIPAL
MACHINE IS ON
THE RAMPAGE
Old Brakes Do Not
Seem to Operate.
. DOLLAR TAX CRY IS BOGUS
VALUE OF OAKLAND A THING
TO CONJURE WITH.
His Honor's Message on the Tax
Levy Will Probably Recommend
a Medium Between the Dif
ferent Estimates.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
903 Broadway, Aug. 13.
It is time to put on the brakes. The
municipal automobile is going altogether
t<io fast and a wreck appears to be cer
tain. One or two great things can be
accomplished in one fiscal year, but not
a dozen. Oakland cannot stand the high
pressure now being put upon her. New
charters, boulevards, parks, crematories,
water works and a host of other necessi
ties are big projects. They re of more
importance than the rejection of a saloon
license or a conflict between Betty and
the poundman over a cow, or even the
painting of the City Hall steps. They can
only be brought about by the exercise of
tact, money, brains and persistency. There
is a limit to each of these In this city,
that cannot bo exceeded. It now becomes
the duty of the Councilmen to determine
that limit and to be bound by it.
The first consideration, very naturally,
js money, and after that expediency. Mon
day evening the Council will hear what
the Auditor has to say about taxes. Mayor
Snow will also send in an accompanying
message. Mr. Breed's figures have been
printed and circulated. The Mayor's ideas
are yet sealed, but. any one who has fol
lowed his course for the last ten years
need not do any guessing. Mr. Snow's
t message will be as diplomatic as his con
duct' has been Cor the past four months.
He has figured that the total estimates
of the various departments will need a
tax- of 15 cents more than the dollar. The
Auditor has cut everything to get it with
in the dollar. The Mayor will go be
tween the two. ' -It will be found tnat he
has added to th Auditor's ligures some
improvements that are in tne depart
mental estimates.
No one knows better than Mr. Snow the
hollowness of the cry of the dollar tax i
levy. Oakland is now assessed for $6,000,-
OKi less than a few ears ago. On a dollar
tax this decrease means a reduction of
J'JO.iHH). In 1891 the city was assessed for
$1,000,000 more than this year, and no sane
man will believe that Oakland is not
worth $10.<>X>,(XÂ»0 more to-day than in IWI.
At the former date the vast system of
street railroads now in operation was in
its infancy, and many of the roads were
not built. None of the larger business
blocks then existed; Clay street was un
heard of as a commercial thoroughfare
and Washington street was only begin
ning to be a rival to Broadway. Had the
assessment roll kept reasonable pate With
the city's growth, and had now been
alx-ut $lO,WJ,OW, a tax of $1 would be tun
pie for maintaining the city government.
Instead, the city and its needs have
grown and the basis of income has de
creased about 14 per cent. To argue in
favor of a permanent tax levy of $1 under
such circumstances is nothing short of
nonsense. This fact is apparent to both
the Mayor and the Council, and although
there niay be a littif- friction at the open- I
ing of the debate, 1 have little duubt that
t!;.- levy, when finally named, will be ac
ceptable to the taxpayers. I would re
ji.^t what 1 said some weeks ago, that
although at times there might be more
wisdom displayed in the Council cham
ber, there could hardly be more sincerity
and honesty, and consequently the people
believe that they. will receive some benefit
lor every dollar of taxes collected. The
remark last week in a Democratic paper
that â¢"the lower the levy the less the op
portunity for boodling," has no bearing
on the present Council.
There will be one section missing from
the Mayor's message that he was anxious
'.â¢. urgent to the Council. Mr. Snow has
fjr-at faith that President Kipley of the
Santa Fe will promise tv locate a termi
j.ai somewhere â¢within the boundaries of
Oakland. The Mayor has been in touch
with the Santa Fe people for months and
has been waiting for President Kipley,
but as that gentleman has only just ar
rived in the State no promise from him
tan Le included in the. message Monday
nighU
Many of those who should have studied
the city charter as a duty have arrived
at the conclusion that the organic law
of the municipality has a great deal in
it that is good. It could probably be
made a fairly good law if it were amend
ed in about half a dozen places. Some
solution must be found for the intricacies
surrounding the Board of Works. Why
the City Engineer should be one of those
ty control the patronage of the Police,
>ire and Street Departments, and the
City Auditor should have no seat In the
board. Is something that has always re
mained unexplained. This is the hardest
problem that will confront a convention
of freeholders charged with the duty of
charter making or amending. The exact
line separating the jurisdiction of the
board and ill-.- City Council must also be
determined. There are some restrictions
regarding contracts that need to be ad
justed so that the city can take advantage
n f current prices the same as any other
purchaser. Incidentally I would add that
the salary of the Street Superintendent
be increased. There is no reason why this
I'fhcer should be paid less than the Chicf 3
of the Police and Fire Departments. His
iinaiK.-ial responsibilities are greater than
either of these '!.â  .rs and he must be a
man with an engineering education,
whereas the other two offices are fre
quently filled from the political ranks.
The Superintendent of the Street Depart
l ment is underpaid at $1500 per year, while
the Chief of Police receives $2100.
Both the City Attorney and the Mayor
believe that the present charter can be
perfected by 'the necessary amendments,
and as the tax levy estimates make no
appropriation for a charter election this
may be the plan adopted.
"A Chinaman always wants to learn;
he may differ from you, even when he
fully agrees with you for the purpose
of drawing out of you your method of
arriving at your conclusion, which may be
better than his method." This remark
was made Friday night before the Board
nf Trade by non. F. .X. Schoonmaker,
perhaps the most convincing speaker that
ever came from the East to lecture in the
West. His remarks reminded me of the
manner in which Mr. Mott's suggestions
i-gar'ding the City Hall have been re
ceived. Of course they provoked a con
troversy, as does everything in Oakland.
>pinions, columns of them, h-ave appeared
in print, some intelligent, some honest,
but more the stereotyped expression of
the knockers who infest our midst and
who are as suspicious as the Chinese, but
not so sincere. M. J. Keller seems to
have hit the nail on the head by his re
r:iark that the plan of Mr. Mott will ac
complish the long desired opening of
Washington street along the lines of least
resistance. This is all right so far as the
plan is concerned, but by the way the
opposition is showing its teeth Mr. Mott
may have an idea of his own regarding
the Una of least resistance before he gets
Through. Altogether the municipal pro
gramme- insures immunity from ennui till
Christmas, at the earliest.

NE PTUNE WELGOMES THE ARIONS
HEPTUNE was the host of the
Arlons, both of San Francisco
and Gotham, yesterday, and
the hoary old sea king proved
a most amiable host. The
steamer Piedmont left the ferry slip at
9 a. m. with 1200 happy, good-natured
and enthusiastic Germans, including
the visitors from the East, as passen
gers, and two policemen as extra bal
last, bound on an excursion around
the bay. The steamer headed for the
Union Iron Work?, and after circling
around the battleship lowa started for
the briny deep. As the vessel crossed
the line, somewhere in the vicinity of
Angel Island, Neptune, in the person
of E. A. Otto, came aboard, armed
with an enormous trident and a fierce
growth of whiskers and attended by a
body-guard that gave every evidence
of a long residence among barnacles
and seaweed. The crew and passengers
were lined up against the bulwarksâ
and barâ and the ceremony of initia
tion into the mysteries of the deep was
begun. President Richard Weinacht
of the New York Arions was first in
vested with the rank of admiral and
installed as supreme commander of the
ship as a mark of special favor. Presi
dent J. F. Plagemann of the San Fran
cisco Arions was made vice admiral,
and the jeweled collar was placed
about his neck by the graceful maiden,
Delphine, known among her associates
as George Purlenke.
Delphine forgot to shave before
breakfast and was severely rebuked
by his Majesty for appearing in com
pany with a very large mustache dec
orating her upper lip. Fritz Beringer
was made commodore and Dr. Max
Magnus captain of the fleet, and then
the Sea King took his departure, after

BY HER TALENT
AS A MUSICIAN
Miss Dcs Rochers'
Success.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway. Aug. 13.
Nine years ago, with the ink yet wet
on her High School diploma, Miss Maude
dcs Rochers left Oakland and her scores
of friends for New York, bent on com
pleting a musical education that wan
already well advanced. This week, with
New York honors thick upon her, and
skilled through long monfhs and years of
hard study on the piano, she has returned
to her old home.
During her long absence Miss Dcs
Rochers has enjoyed a thorough course
of study, and met with a degree of suc
cess that would have turned the head of
almost any other giri. But modesty is
yet one ol Miss I^-h Rochers 1 chief ohar
acteristics. She can pride herself upon
b< ng â  of this country's
Kilted pianistes, and one who Is
admitted within the limits of New York
sacred circle, where many a
â  woman more persistent and less
modest has failed utterly to enter. She

; her achievement, almost unaware of its
gi â¢at s-:gr:iii< mice.
Within the last year Miss ] >es Roehers
gay*- of concerts In < '.irnegie
Hall. They were strictlj invitational and
vrere attended by the best people of L^ir;
Eastern metropolis. Among those pres
ent and presumably interested in the en
tetainmonts were the John D. Rocke
fellers, the Dr. Keyes and other proml-
I nent families of musical inclination.
Miss Dcs Roc. prs was .l.^.siHted ;u these
concerts by Erricksson Bushnell, the
great barytone, and by Judson Bushnell,
his brother, together with other fine
artists. Sh.; won pi her dainty
programme and the- most generous
plaudits for her playing, her tone, expres
sion, power and finish being of the high
est quality.
The Rockefellers wf-rf so charmed with
! the talented Californlan girl that they
j engaged her to play at a drawing room.
Next season also Miss Dcs Rochers will
be heard at the Rockefellers, where the
most artistic find talented people of New
York gather.
Miss Dcs Rochers will remain in Oak
land until October. She is now the guest
of Mrs. John L,. Howard on Vernon
Heights. She pays Oakland Is the Boston
of ihe West, and declares that it tia*
musical talent of a high order In in abun

Dr. Magnus carrit-d off the honors.
That cakewalk of the doctor's was

While Dr. Magnus' cakewalk was
generally voted the strangest and most

THE T OWER OF BABEL"
DR NELANDER'S THEME
Rev. Dr. Nelander delivered an Inter
sermon to his congregation at the
English Lutheran Church last cveu
lng H ;,:-. s was entitled tlie "Tower
of Bab I. ' He said In part:
At the beginninf of our history we for
mulated the Monroe doctrine, it was our
Â Â; Babel! We declined to lend a
hand In the overthrow of the unspeakable
Turk aii'i the deliverance of a persecuted
.. The Lord then pointed I a peop.e
â¢it our very doorsâ the desolated and starv
insr Cubans. It was Of no avail. Throe
weary years went by: then down went the
Maine! And the spray of that dismal wreck
to admonish us. That was (Sod's way
of broadening our theory of national life.
\t thN moment we are dreaming dreams of
American greatness. Why should we Join
,â  . (hat has inarched through
the centuries with trumpets and flying ban
ners to dust and oblivionl Ood has better
things In store for us. Let It be our glory
to Â«iv" shelter to the persecuted ami ex
t.-nJ the merciful rei^-n of Christ.
GREAT MOTORS
AND NOBLE FATHERS
Dr. Charles Edward IÂ»eke at the
Central Methodist Church last evening
d< live-red the second of his sermons un
the "Home Circle." His subject was
"Great Mothers and Noble Fathers." He
Sa -'-The home is a Scriptural institution.
(â hrist ; anity is intended for the home, for
liaus told one of his converts 'Go home
to thy friends and tell them what tne
lord hath d<m.- fur thee. 1 Piety m the
home aid.s in the forming of true char
at "There is a mother-force in the world;
there are mother-made men. Luther
â¢iid Wesley, Augustine, Cromwell, Scott,
\Kassiz, Washington, Lincoln and Me-
Klnley are all iUustrations of /the doctrine
H,V hand that rocks the cradle rules the
world.' " t
REV. W. E. DUCAN
SPEAKS ON DREYFUS
\t Stewart Memorial Unitarian Presby
terian Church, Rev. W. E. Dugan spoke
last night on Dreyfus and his trial. The
pastor treated the interesting subject in
an able manner. He said In ''rief:
"Much interest is centered about the
trial < f Dreyfus. For a long time be lias
been banished to Devils island, where he
has been subjected to the must inhuman
treatment Now he la brought back Â«nd
is having a new trial and will probably
be acquitted. It teaches that God has not
forgotten the Jew. While the Jews are no
longer a nation, God still loves them."
MR. DIBBLE TALKS IT
OVER WITH BURNS
EXTRA SESSION PLANS FUR
THER DISCUSSED.
Committee of One Hundred Delegates
Go Unpledged to the Demo
cratic Convention.
_ .
Assemblyman Henry C. Dibble called
upon Colonel Burns at the Palace last
night, and some further discussion con- j
cerning an extra session of the Legislature j
ensued between them. Phil Crimmins â¢
made the third party to the powwow,
but for all that nothing more than was
published yesterday was accomplished.
Although Crimmins and Kelly showed
up poorly tn the late primary elect ions
they still control the Senatorial votes of
Assemblyman â¢ - Mike" Barry and Fred
I^undqiiist. and, it is said, can deliver the !
ballots of Assemblyman Crowley an.l Sen
ator Feeney, Democrats, if it cornea to a I
Bhow-down. For this and fur other rea
sons Mr. Crimmins has occupied a prom- '
Inent part in the conferences of the past
few days.
Rather a peculiar aspect of affairs has!
developed among the delegates elected by
the Committee of One Hundred at the pri
maries. Although it has been known that
they were elected by the Phelan push for
Phelan purposes, they have held caucuses
in every district during the past few days
and have decided to go into the conven
tlon pledged to no candidate. In the meet- j
ings that have occurred there have been :
several anti-Phelan harangues of much
force, and the spirit of discord has devel
oped to such an extent that no candidate I
is to be named until thts eve of the con- j
ventlon.
The selection of a county committee at |
tho coming Democratic convention prom- ;
Ises to be a lively affair. In every district
where the Committee of One Hundred is
in power there are candidates paint-" fur
the places, and it will be no easy task to
settle the rivalry in some districts.
Ralney will probably win some in the
Thirty-eighth District, and George Max
well is willing to do the right itiing for â 
the Bush street boss in the Forty-fourth i
District. Outside of these districts Rain, y'â 
at present he is not so strong, but he is
working hard to win a few more on the '
list.
Delegates elected to the various conven
tions can receive their certificates of eloc
tion by calling at the registration office I
on Monday after 11 o'clock a. m.

Plan to Duplicate the Orpheum Entertain
ment at the Grand Opera-House for
Those Who Could Not Afford
the High-Priced Seats,
c? T li becoming evident that the Or
i}â . phoum will not be able to hold all who
j are anxious to be at the great volun
ii teers' benefit to be given next Thurs
day afternoon. Already wails are be
. â¢;rc heard from the. many who had not the
purses to bid at the auction and who now
cannot get any but seats near the doorâ
and even such seats are not numerous.
â There are hundreds who would gladly pay
premiums for Beats, but who could not
hope to compete with the prices paid at
â  -the' auction last Thursday. As a conse
â¢ quence they havebeen left out in the cold,
and they are lust as anxious to attest
their patriotism and enthusiasm as their
more fortunate neighbors. They are en
titled to some consideration in the mat
ter;' and sn for the benefit of those who
would give what they in. even though
the â ;m might not be large, an overflow
entertainment was suggested;
The suggestion came in the following
tter:
SAN-FBAXCISCO, Auk. 13 1599.
Kdit-r. Ca-ll: I was unable to procure seats
at the Orpheum yesterday tor the benefit next
Thursday in aid of the fund to entertain the
California boys.
"1 here are probably a great many people as
disappointed- aii myself.
As this fs an easy and quick way to raise
moirey. -cannot you "and your influence secure
theC'Orand Opera-house for next Thursday and
Kive tiii" same i>^rforrnance as at the Or
l>h?um? â 
I\->uMless itianv of those who volunteered to
play at the Orpheum would play at the Gfand

ing to obtain tickets at the Orpheum would lv
' gratified. Your? truly. .SI" P.SCRIBER.
To have an overflow entertainment there
must be another theater, and the theater
is already at hand. Wai:. Morosci came
t<. the rescue last night when town a let
ter to The. Oah from one "i the many
who could not stand the strain 01" the i
auction <'f seats. He was asked if he
v; , ;. .. allow the use of his theater for the
",. *irte : ri:6on of Tkursuay next if it was
: iJiunu possibie to give a second perform
! 'iti-ye for those who could not secure seats i
â¢' at "iiit- Orpheum: His answer was â¢harac- j
â  t-erisi-ic aud to the point.
: "Our tneaier .s open tor the use of th?

â  Mr. Morosco said he was willing to do :
anything: in his power to help swell the

"~ Maia. "and w<- have sixteen of tnem; or

-â¢'ivrir.K the matter up before the theatrical
.. niana'gers; but this hi- â lined to do. "II
.'. â¢ would not look well for me to advance
. thy" claims of my own theater," he ob
, "jected. â â¢ am. willing to help, but I don't
.like- CD put myself in the position of seek

â¢ pear here after appearing at the < >rpheum
andiXhe people will come, the theater is
' ' .the disposal of the committee."
There is 'no doubt about the people
â¢ roming. They will be _ id to find he op
' portunity. There Is more than one house
â¢ ful of patriotism in .San b'rancisco, and
the-man who works with his hands is as
glad to have his son or his friend come
with the boys as he who has money to
â  spend. They .ill want to get into the
â¢ t heaters and to the benefit performances;,
and to cheer every time a flag is shown
or shout every time there is a martial
chorus. Such benefit performances as
. are. coming this week are not all .in the.
stage. They are in the pit and in th*
.boxes; in . the galerles and along the
aisles. They art In the thousands w.io
gather together all for the. same purpose
.âto help along the same end, and it
"would be a poor time for merrymaking If
' any one should be crowded out.
' A liar Is nothing to pay for a seat at
.a volunteers' benefit, hut there are no
more dollar seais at the Orpheum, and
â â  it is the man with a dollar who must ao
the bulk of the welcoming. It is the man

Manager Morrisey of the Orpheum, llk<Â»
' Mr. Thai!, is uncertain as to just how the
'artists will take to the idea. "] can read
ily see thi â  I the plan," he said,
â¢'and in addition to making it possible for
those not counted among the wealthy to
show their patriotism it would greatly
augment the receipts, as the Grand Opera

doubtless it WOUld be crowded. I am

suggestion can be carried mil."
Manager Friedlander of the California
Theater said:
"I fully agree with The Call that th*Â»
people should be given an opportunity to
attend the monster benefit performance;
but to my mind it is impossible to give
another performance at another house

"The artists who are to appear at the

CITY WILL BE IN
A BLAZE OF GLORY
Electric Display Planned
on a Most Gigantic
Scale.
SAN FRANCISCO will literally hÂ» in a
Maze of glory when the current is
sent through the 10,000 Incandescent
electric lights that jro to make up the
great electrical illumination which will be
â¢ Lture of the celebration In honor of
the return of the California volunteers.
Nothing like it has ever been seen in
this city. The citizens who have wa
with interest t>s - â  stringing of wires
across Market street can form but
a feeble conception of the magnitude of
the vi ale of grandeur
h the display will be made.
Scarcely â¢ I the wires for the
street lights have been put in place.
There ha.s been a vague idea that Market
â  was to be illuminated overhead, but
the plans of the decoration committee are
much more pretentious. There will be a
continuous stream of electric lights from!
the time ball en the tower of the ferry |
depot up Market street to the dome, of the
city Hall.
The committee, consisting of W. J. Mar
tin (chairman). William H. Mills, I. \V.
Hellman Jr., A. Schilling, Charles Hirscta
and H. M. Holbrook, had many proposi
tions under consideration and spent many |
days discussing them before they finally :
decid 'I upon the electrical display mid
awarded the contract to the Pacific [ncan
desi 'I.; Lamp < Jompany.
.The plans call for an Illuminatidn the
equal of which ha never been seen on
the Pacific Coast. It will be on a
nf grandeur never before undertaken in .
this oiiy and of a magnitud â¢â â¢> can
appr< ciate from a casual Inspection of the
wÂ«.rk thus far prosecuted.
T.-n thousand in ni lights will be
The stringers which will form, the
canopy of light over Market street will ;
consume In the neighborhood of 216,000 feet <
hi copper wire. En the decorations at the!
ferry depol and the City Hall 26,000 feet
of Insulated wire will be necessary, and
every fool of this hitter will have to be j
handled separately by the workmen in the 1
employ of the contractors. So great has
been the demand for electric material to
complete the display that the local mark!
has been drained. Los Angeles and Sao
ramento have been (ailed upon for ex
tras, and all the available stock in the
two cities has been spoken for. Even
with the supplies from the outside cities
the Pacific Company found itself short
nearly 5000 porcelain sockets for the In
candescent lamps. Tn order that there
might be no delay In completing the work
the company improvised :i Bocket out of
copper wire and yesterday afternoon set a
large force of men at work turning them
out. Eighty men are now employed bj
the company exclusively on the work in
connection with the illumination, and as
soon as they begin to string the wires
on ihr ferry* depot and the City Hall an
additional crew of twenty-five men will
be pressed into service. Their storeroom
on Anna lane Is a scene of unusual activ
ity. Shifts are at work day and night
preparing the material for the men on the !
streets. The work is being prosecuted :
with vigor, and despite the short time j
remaining for its? completion everything
will be ready when the California boys ar
rive.
Beginning at the ferry, the tower of the
building will be outlined by strings of
light extending from the time ball down
to :i ir> big clock. Pour huge electric stars i
about ten feet high will shine from the
four sides of the tower midway between
the pinnacle and the clock. Just above
the hip timepti cc, on the Market-street
side, there will be a set figure about 15x25
feet with the words "All Welcome Home."
T'p Market street to the City Hall lights
will be strung across the street at inter
vals of fifty feet. Each of these strings
will carry twenty-four lights, and every
fifth cluster will be arched with thirty
four lights.
The decorations at the City Hall will be
r.nf of the features of the ilumination.
The building from the base of the globe
on the dome to the foundation will be
brought out in profile. Every outline will
be marked by electric lights. From the
main columns strings of lights will ex
tend to the dome. A huge canopy of
lights with the Lick monument as the
center will be constructed over City Hall
Park,

completed and given to the public to

been prepared, and the aggregation of
talent will be the strongest that has ever
appeared on any stage at one time in this
city.
The management desires it to be known
that all unsold tickets will be placed on
sale this morning at the Orpheum box
office at 9 o'clock. Notwithstanding the
enormous sale there are a few seats left.
Bids will also be received by L. A.
Morgenstern for two unsold boxes, one
of which was donated by Edward Mar
shuts, who paid his â¢ premium of $100.
Wendell Easton has consented to sell thÂ«
box at the Produce Exchange or the
Chamber of Commerce, and if he can rind
the time he will do so. However, bids
may be left- at the Orpheum office.
The management also requests all those
having seats at the benefit who may wish
to leave before the end of the extremely
long performance, to deposit their scat
coupons in the box-office and they will he
resold for the benefit of tlie fund. The
performance will last six hours in all,
commencing at 12:30 p. m. sharp. .

do well to attend the auction
sale for the choice of seats and
boxes at the Alhambra Thea

Arion concert to be given for
the benefit of the volunteer
fund to-morrow night in the
same theater. It will be a not
able affair, and the generous
offer of the German singing
society to help the fund for
the returning volunteers
should meet with substantial
returns.
Strong efforts will be made
by the German Citizens' Com
mittee to equal if not surpass
the extraordinary success of
the Orpheum sale last week. A
big crowd will be in attend
ance and the bidding will be
spirited, from all accounts.

BIG INTEREST IN
ARION CONCERT
Thp auction sale for tho Arion concert
to I"- given for the benefit of the Cali
fornia Volunteers' feceptiOH fund at the
Alhambra Theater to-day at noon prom
ises to be a gala affair ami Is exp<
to duplicate the financial success of the
sale at the Orpheum last Thursday.
The citizens' committee of forty promi
nent Germans, appointed by chairman De
SToui g of the finance committee, will take
charge ol the sale and they have all
expressed their Jntention u< gather in a
large amount of money to help the good
cause.
The generous offer of the New York
Ari' is should meet with a hearty re
sponse from the public. Their singing is
a rare treal and once enjoyed will never
be ;'' rgotton. Asidi from this it must by
known thai only the spirit <^' contagious
patriotism which pervades the entire com
mun ty has prompted this noble hand of
Germans to assisi in raising the neces
sary money to fittingly receive the Cali
fornia soldiers who sacrificed so much in
of their country.
The ii'.ni";- was current on the -â¢
yesterday thai a wealthy German citizen
will emulate the example of Mrs. A. S.
Townsend, who set the pacÂ« for the
Orpheum sale by her substantial bids.
It is said thai tl itizen referred to
will bid considerably above the $l'Â»'O
mark for the choice of the first box. How
ever true thai may !"â . it is absolutely
certain thai a number of patriotic <;-i
--mans will be at th< sale prepared to dive
deep down in their t kets on this oc
casion. It is expe< ti I thai both the box< -
and seats will iiriim a splendid advance,
and the successful bidders will have the
added advantage "f being present at the
most notable musical affair ever wit
nessed in San Francisco.
Already many requests for seats have
beer, received at the Alhambra box office,
hut these will only be considered after
ili, auction sale is concluded. The doors
of 1 1 >â¢ â  theater will I pened at 11:30 ami
it is hoped that only ftitending bidders
will take the seats which have been re
served for them at the sale. Wendell
Easton has repeated his generous offer
â¢,' . induct the auction and will he as
sisted by Colonel .1. 1-. Lyon and the able
corps "f assistants who made the Or
pheum sale the distinctive success that
it was.
'I'lie wealthy visitors who have enntrih
uted their tim< and talents will he on
hand t" spur timid bidders and will prob
ably themselves catch the auctioneer's
eye 'nee in awhile. The Alhambra will
hold two thousand people, and it is cer
tain that every nook and crevice will be
occupied both at the auction sale this
morning and at the concert Tuesday
night.
