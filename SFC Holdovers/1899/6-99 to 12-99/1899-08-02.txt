CENTRAL PACIFIC'S MOVE
TO FIGHT EASTERN RIVALS
Proposed Extension of Competing Lines to
Utah Causes the New Incorporation,
SALT LAKE, Utah. Aug. I.â Every
effort is being made to keep the
movements of those concerned in
the new incorporation of the Cen
tral Pacific in the shade. When
Chief Counsel Herrin of the Southern
Pacific, first came here and consulted
with Thomas Marshall, ho said that
his visit was for the purpose of litiga
tion only. Little by little the facts are
'.caking out. Marshall refused to be in
terviewed yesterday, but to-day he
said to The Call correspondent that the
relations of tho Central Pacific with the
Southern Pacific will be very close and
intimate. He stated further that the
local board would act in conjunction
â with the majority of the New York
directors, but as to the future he sen
tentiously replied:
"I don't know and wouldn't tell if I
did know. But there is this much
about it." he continued, "the Southern
Facific has got to protect itself from
these Eastern roads that are going to
enter here."
"Then you believe that some Eastern
company will extend into ftah."
"Yes; there is no doubt about it." re
plied Marshall.
"Why." said he. "all of those roads
in Denver will eventually enter Salt
Uake."
There in be no doubt that this jew
r.rganization means business. Tr- new
corporation will assuredly operate the
Central Pacific in all its departments.
It will build bran* I and develop the
interests of this and other States.
"Whether the location of the shops, etc..
is changed or not the headquarters of
the Central Pacific Railway Company
will be In Utah'i metropolis per
manently.
These are the two prominent points
in the incorporation of the Central Pa
cific. That it means aggressive ac
tion on the part of the Southern Pa
cific in this State there is no doubt,
and with the filing of the expected pa
pers railroad men look for some start
ling developments in the very near fu
ture.
The incorporation is in many nays
merely a matter of form. As far as
the Central Pacific is concerned, the

ADMIRAL
DEWEY AND
THE GERMANS
While at Trieste He Did Not
Conceal His Displeasure
at Manila Events.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, Aug. I.â The Daily News'
correspondent at Vienna says
that while few* people there credit
the statement attributed to Ad
miral Dewey, in which he made
â¢wa-like remarks about the Germans at
Manila, the admiral, while at Trieste,
did not conceal his displeasure at the
altitude of German naval officers at
Manila. He repeated the statement
that they gave themselves the airs of
being masters there. Among all the
naval officers before Manila they alone
refused to respect the regulations im
posed by the American admiral.
TRIESTE, Aug. I.â The Olympia left
Trieste at 4:15 o'clock this afternoon.
When she began to s move slc-wlj- from
among the shipping and boats, some
containing those who had gone out to
say good-by to Admiral Dewey, Cap
tain Lambert-. ri and other officers, she
gradually increased her speed to about
ten knot's, until the two white figures
on the bridge were no longer recogniz
able. The blympia was watched from
the shore until she disappeared on th"
horizon. To-day was spent on board
making final preparations for the voy
age. Naples is the next port of call.
Admiral Dewey returned on board at
I*3o o'clock. There was not a ripple on
the sea. which reflected the brilliant
sunshine, as the famous cruiser started
to make the four days" run to Naples.
Phe may be expected in that port by
Saturday evening or Sunday morning.
The rlympia did not salute on leaving
Trieste* nÂ«*>r did Admiral Dewey make
any official calls, as naval or diplomatic
etiquette did not require either. Cards,
however, were sent.

I. W. ASTOR
A BRITISH
SUBJECT
Shews Resentment at Being
Taxed by Renouncing
American Citizenship.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, Aug. I.â The Gazette
announces to-day that William
Waldorf Astor was naturalized a
British subject "July 11 of the
sent year.
NEW YORK. Aug. I.â Little surprise
was occasioned in New York to-day by
the report from London that Mr. Astor
had decided to renounce his American
citizenship and become a British sub
ject. That he would take such action
was intimated upon his last visit to
this country, when he.appeared before
the Commissioners of Taxes and As
sessments and demand) that his tax
bills be reduced.
Astor has engaged in disputes with
the department of taxes almost an
nually ever since his father. John Jacob
Astor. left him an estate valued at be
tween $75,000,000 and $100,000,000 in 1890.
Mr. Astor has long stood at the head erf
the tax lists, his assessments being the
largest of any man on the books.
It was the custom of the Commis
sioners of Taxes during the first few
years after Mr. Astor came into his
father's estate to levy a personal as
sessment of $6,000,000. Mr. Astor finally
objected to the amount and it was re
duced to .... 000,000, at which it has re
mained for several years. Mr. Astor
let it be known early this year that he
considered $2,000,000 too high and he
made plans for personally fighting the
assessment. Mr. Astor, accompanied
by his children, came to New York on
the Majestic on March 29 last. He at
once let it be known that unless the
Commissioners of Taxes reduced his
personal assessment Instead of increas
ing his real estate assessment he would
renounce his citizenship.
The Waldorf-Astoria had been In
creased from $3,900,000 to $5,500,000, and
a similar proportion of increase was
made in all of Mr, Astor*s real estate
buildings. The Increase of $1,600,000 in
the assessment of the Waldorf-Astoria
property did not fall entirely on Will
iam Waldorf Astor. as he owns the
Waldorf, while John Jacob Astor owns
thÂ» Astoria. But the proportion of In
crease made In that property applies
to hundreds of pieces of real estate
which Mr. Astor owns in various parts
of the city.

Northern Pacific Will Follow the Co

PORTLAND, Or., Aug. I.â The Ore
gonian to-morrow will say: The Northern
Pacific Railroad Company has determined
to come into Portland down the Columbia
River Pass. If it cannot get trackage
over the Oregon Railway and Navigation
Company's main line, it will build down .
the north bank of the Columbia.
President Meilln admits that the North- '
crn Pacific had been forced Into its pres
ent position by topography. If the road
is to haul to the seaboard any consider*,
able share of the cereal products of the
Columbia River basin it must do sol

Pacific has been practically completed
the company will take some steps to

cessity for this has several times .of
late been pointed out. The first step,
it is believed, will be to enter Salt
Lake City, and the statement is again

Southern Pacific will start too.

SOUTH AMERICA IS
NO LONGER FRIENDLY
United States' Imperialistic Policy
â¢ Regarded With Disfavor and
Suspicion.
NEW YORK, Aug. I.â Dr. Laurean3
A'illanuova, ex-President of Venezuela,
who is at present in New York, when
asked this morning through his inter
preter whether it was true that the
South American countries were about
to form an offensive and defensive al
liance against the United States on ac
count of the "Imperial policy," replied
that he had not heard of It, but thought
that such an alliance ought to be made.
"Do the South 'American nations fear
the United States?"
The ex-President shrugged his shoul
ders and opened' and shut his hands
rapidlyâ opened . them Wide, as If he
were grasping continents, and then
said something in Spanish.
"Mr. Villanuova thinks," said the in
terpreter, "that the United States will
take allâ - - .
"But the United States may be satis
fied with the Philippines," said the re
porter.
"Oh, no, the United States wants Eu
rope and the Indies at least," came
from the. President through- the in
terpreter.
â  "Do all the South American republics
think as you do - about the United
States?" - <
"Why, of course. It is a well-known
fact. Who can doubt it? Do you deny
it?"
PENNSYLVANIA REGIMENT HOME
WITHOUT ITS GALLANT LEADER
Colonel Hawkins Died From Can
cer When the Transport Was
Two Days out From Yokohama.
The Hour for Landing the Soldier Boys
From the Transport and for the Pa
rade Up Market Street Will Be Set
by General Shafter To-Day.
Â£=r=_3HE transport Senator, with
Pennsylvania's gallant Tenth
Regiment aboard, passed \
I through the Golden Gate at
dusk last evening. There were
no wild hurras from the brave boys in
blue from the Keystone State, no thun- ;
dering . outbursts of- pent-up en- ;
thusiasm. Every heart was heavy,
and . tears trickled down the' haggard
faces of many a soldier aboard the
steamer, for during the voyage their
brave colonel, Alexander L. Hawkins, ;
succumbed to the ravages of cancer, |
and his lifeless body lay in state on the â 
deck of the ship.
Colonel Hawkins died at exactly five
minutes to 12. on the night of July IS, I
just two days after the Senator left the
harbor of Yokohama, and pointed her
prow toward the land for whose princi
ples her cargo of battle-scarred soldiers
had risked and suffered so much.
Out of the 862 returning officers and
men of the Pennsylvania Regiment
only twelve were ill during the . oyage
and according to Major Neff, they were
only slightly affected with ordinary
complaintE.
After passing in. the Senator .--team
ed up the bay and anchored off the
Quarantine Station on Angel Island.
Dr. Klnyoun boarded her shortly after
her arrival, and finding a clean bill of
health, he allowed the transport to
come down the bay again and anchor
in the stream off the Government
I wharf, where â  .she- will remain until
this morning.
If the wishes of Lieutenant Colonel
James Barnett arid the men of the regi
ment are respected, the soldiers will
disembark immediately after the Sena
j tor docks this morning. The landing
| of the troops and the commencement of
â¢ their triumphant march through the
j city to the Presidio will be signaled by
j the blowing of whistles.
The same rousing reception which
! was accorded the Oregon and Nebraska
i Volunteers and the Utah Battery will
j be given Pennsylvania's gallant regi
i ment, when It comes ashore this morn
ing. San j Francisco will once again
open her : big heart 1 and give . a \ royal
welcome to the . boys jas they march up
Market street. â¢ J â  â  ,- v . *â¢â¢..-.
â " Colonel Hawkins was the idol of the
regiment. He was loved, honored and '
respected by every man in the regi
ment, ani when the news that his soul
had passed into the beyond was -oread j
over the steamer, most of the men wept
bitterly. It was a blanket of sorrow j
thrown over Pennsylvania's fighting
Tenth, which time alone can lift.
"I would rather lead my regiment j
through the city of Pittsburg than be '
elected President of the United States."
Thus spoke Colonel Hawkins shortly
before the veil of death began to en
velop his earthly horizon. And none of !
the group of officers who had gathered
about his deathbed to say a last fare
well doubted the feeble declaration of;
their dying colonel.
Major Neff. surgeon in chief, worked
heroically to keep the spark of life burn- j
ing in this gallant veteran of two wars. j
in order that his dying wish to live to j
lead his regiment through Pittsburg
might be gratified, but Major Neff's
efforts were all in vain.
The messenger of death was kind to
Colonel Hawkins, for just one hour be
fore the end unconsciousness stole
gently upon him, so his end was peace
ful. The body was placed in a her
metically sealed casket and laid out j
on the deck of the steamer and a guard |
of honor placed over it.
The officers and men of the Penn
sylvania Regiment are vehement in
their denials of rumors which have j
been circulated about the country to the
effect that they had serious trouble
with the California troops. A story
has been going the rounds that in one I
of the first engagements of the recent
campaign the California boys shot reck
lessly into the ranks of the Pennsyl
vania Regiment and as a result they
were transferred from the firing line
to Negros Island.
"This story is a vile slander and an J
imputation on the patriotism and sol- ;
dierly bearing of both the California;
troops and our own regiment," ex- i
claimed an officer of high rank in the !
Pennsylvania Regiment when the sub
ject was broached last evening.
"When our "regiment first set foot on
California soil we were given a royal
reception. The people of San Francisco
were extremely kind and hospitable
'â  and every member of our regiment ap
preciated the cordial spirit shown us
Iby Californians. Down in Manila the
j California troops were not only re
spected, but well liked by every other
volunteer regiment down there.
"They were the same generous, warm,
hearted class of people who heralded
our arrival here with shouts of wel
come. They 'were sons of the people
who made our stay in San Francisco
pleasant, and besides they were fighters
from the ground up, and that made all
of us warm to' them."
"I am extremely sorry this story has
i been set afloat, for there is not one iota
of* truth in it. All the volunteer regi
ments in the Philippines were banded
together with* strong bonds of friend
: ship. There were no petty jealousies
â  between the regiments. In the field
! they stood together and fought, for
their country for the same glory and
the one flag.'' - -
.The Tenth Pennsylvania boys were
in some of the must important engage
j ments in the Philippines. On the night
of July 31 and early morning of August
1. 1898, in company with the Utah Light
Artillery, they were in the only spirited
contest with the Spaniards. The fight
lasted from 11:30 p. m. to 3 a. m. and
a typhoon played an accompaniment to
' the crack of the rifles. Reinforcements
arrived in the shape of the First Call-
| fornia arid Batteries H and X of the
Third Artillery, and the Spaniards re
tired. . ' â¢â '-'â  : "'i
The regiment participated in the ad
vance upon and capture of Manila, and
I on February 4. 1899, was in the first

! fight began at 10 a. m. and ended at
i 4 p. m. in the capture of De Le Loma

GOTHAM'S ARCHITECT
REFUSED TO ANSWER
TECHNICAL QUESTIONS
Suspicion That He Was Unable
to Do So â Mazet Commission
Resumes Its Work.
NEW YORK, Aug. The feature of
the Mazet executive investigating com
mittee, which to-day resumed Its ses
sions after about six weeks' vacation,
was the examination of Messrs. Hor
gan & Slattery, a firm of architects and
actors, who testified that they
have hail work on steamboats, jails,
gardens, station houses, dump scows,
etc., for various city departments. On
account of the amount of work per
formed by Horgan & Slattery, Mr.
Moss, the attorney for the committee,
applied to them the title of "Municipal
Architects." Mr. Moss devoted the
morning to trying to bring out facts
showing why this firm of architects
received many contracts in the city
and how it was that they had been al
lowed to condemn the plans of other
architects. Mr. Slattery declined to
answer certain questions touching his
qualifications as an architect, referring
Mr. Moss to his partner, Mr. Horgan,
and a lively controversy ensued.
Deputy Sheriff Mulvaney was the
first witness called. Mr. Moss, counsel
for the committee, wanted to know if
the Sheriff had taken any action to
stop gambling in, the absence of such
preventive steps by the police. The
deputy Sheriff said he was aware that
a statute provided for such action, but
believed it applied to such counties as
were infperfectly policed.
"Our object," explained Mr. Moss, "in
bringing you here was to call your at
tention to this section of the law which
makes it incumbent on Sheriffs to sup
press crime, Betting on horse races is
now practiced In this city to an extra
ordinary extent, and it is our intention
to bring this fact to the attention of
all the public authorities within the
provisions of this resolution."
Mr. Moss then called President
Michael O. Murphy, of the Health De
partment, and questioning him con
cerning work done by Horgan & Slat
tery, city architects.
. Colonel Murphy said Horgan &
Slattery had erected Williard Hospital.
There had been no- public competition
for this work.
- Arthur J. Horgan, of Horgan & Slat
tery. was called. He said he designed
the new city prison; that the- steel cells
cost $310,000, and that his firm got 5
per cent for their work. He had never
talked with John F. Carroll about the

money. He had made most of the
drawings for the steel cells himself,
and none had been made by a Western j
designer.
Vincent J. Slattery, Horgan's part- j
ncr, confirmed Horgan's statement
that the firm had never paid any money
to Mr. Carroll. Slattery said that the
leading architects and architectural
papers had upheld his firm's criticism
of the work of John H. Thomas, who
drew the plans tor the new Hall of j
Records building.
"Was that criticism professional?" !
"It was and the city saved a million
dollars by it."
Mr. Slattery said his firm's report on
â¢Mr. Thomas' plan was drawn up by
Mr. Horgan. The witness objected to
many of the questions and spoke in a

William Dorn, the mascot of the
Tenth, Pennsylvartians, was an Oregon
boy who attached himself to the regi
ment while it was in camp at the Pre
sidio. He had fiery red hair and the
boys christened him "Searchlight" in ,
consequence. He was a general favor
ite, and no one was more sincerely
mourned than the little mascot when
dysentery carried him away.
During a conversation aboard the
transport last night Lieutenant Colonel
James Barnett said: - -.'-'-7 7
"The boys are glad to get back to
God's country once again, but every
man in the regiment is sad and dis
heartened over Colonel Hawkins' death.
He was a soldier from the ground up
and beloved by all. When the army
started the campaign that led on to
Malolos Colonel Hawkins was then a
very sick man. His surgeons advised
him to return home, but he flatly re
fused. 'Where my men go I go,' he said,
and the last volley at Malolos found
him in the front rank cheering his men.
After Malolos he sank rapidlj'. Those
who knew his true condition had little
hope for his recovery. He was the
most sanguine of us all. As jet I can
not say when the regiment will disem
bark. We will take our orders from
general Shafter." . 7
In addition to the Pennsj'lvanla
troops four officers of other regiments
returned' on furloughs. Those who were
feu-tunate enough to receive well-mer
ited vacations were Captain Dyner and
LleuteharttFleming of the Sixth United
States Artillery, Lieutenant Merriam,
Third United States Artillery, and
Lieutenant Weigle of the First Wash
ington Volunteers. Lieutenant Merriam
isa son of General Merriam, who had
cqmmand of the troops which over
awed the Idaho strikers.
"The boys are all glad to get back,"
said Adjutant Oliver Scott. "We were
in the thickest of the flght at nearly
every' engagement and the boys are all
worn out. We had a rather sorrowful
Journej' across the Pacific. The death
of.. Colonel Hawkins was a sad blow to
the regiment. In every battle he was
-where the bullets flew fastest, cheering
the men on the heels of the flying Fili
pinos. He had heard the hum of flying
bullets before and the din of musketry
was music to his ears. Colonel Haw
kins never asked a man to go where
ha would not trust himself. On the
Sunday following Colonel Hawkins'
death Chaplain Hunter pronounced
simple death services over the body of
our dead hero. The boys of the regi
ment viewed the body and a guard of

the remainder of the trip."

"Connemara marble," said the wit- -

"Now, Mr. Slattery," said Mr. Moss,
"it has been charged in the public

not an architect at all; that in fact
you do not know anything about ar
chitectural works. Is it a He?"
"Yes, it is a lie."
Mr. Horgan was recalled. He said
that in every instance he had drawn all
the plans and specifications for city

"Which do you consider the most

Moss.
"I prefer a beam with flanges."
"Give us the scientific explanation

"I am not here to give you theories as

At this point the court adjourned for ;

After recess,' Frederick Clark With
ers of the firm of Withers & Dickson ;
! said his firm drew the plans for the
Tombs prison under the direction of
i Former Commissioner Wright. Early
in IS9B Commissioner Lantry informed :
: his firm that Horgan & Slattery would
j amend these plans.
Commissioner Lantry, the witness
said, told him that he wished to have j
1 architects in sympathy with the ad- j
ministration. It was intimated that j
1 the witness' firm had better retire from j
the work and finally they were dis
missed. The plans of witness' firm i
called for the construction of- cells cost- j
ing $170,000. Horgan & Slattery's plans
called for an expenditure of $310,000. !
Horgan & Slattery used more material I
than the original specifications called |
for in art decoration. Such art on j
prison cells was bad, Mr. Withers said,
because it gave a place for vermin to
lodge.
Mr. Moss read the original estimate
for the Tombs building, as prepared ;
by Withers & Dickson, and compared j
it item for item with the estimate In
the contract as finally awarded to Hor
gan & Slattery. The additional cost to
the city under the Horgan & Slattery
contract is $220,017.
Mr. Horgan jvas recalled and Mr.
Moss asked a great many technical
questions which witness refused to an

Horgan & Slattery was a corporation. , :
Mr. Horgan and Mr. Slattery owned

The regiment, under â  the command of

j May 25, 1898, and reached Cavite June
27. -On disembarking they took the place

j to tension and temper, and at liberal, cost
of the blood of their best, and that, too,
I under circumstances that would have
i tried the qualities of well-trained veter
ans. :.â¢â¢>.;
It was on the ever-memorable night of
July 31, the occasion of the first clash
! on land in the East left ween the Ameri
| cans and the Spaniards. The night was
pitch dark' and the: rain poured down in
torrents. Deeming it a fit moment to
surprise the green . Yankee volun
teers, General -Norine, commanding â¢at
Malate, hurled 2000 of his best troops
against the American- right, held by the
"Keystone" boys, while Ins guns swept
the Calle Real leading from Malate to
I Paranaque, across which- the America
; lines extended to the beach. The space
between Colonel Hawkins' right and the
long swamp running parallel to the road,
a stretch of some 250 yards, had been held
â¢ by a body of insurgents, but in 'the earl
: hours of the night they quietly withdrew
! Colonel Hawkins learned of their' with
drawal, and with commendable caution
: threw three companiesâ D, E and Xâ
outside the trenches to cover his ex
posed .flank. There the men lay in the
' pouring rain, hardly expecting but yet
; ready for any attack. , .
At -11:80 p. m. it came. From the dense
i thicket skirting the swamps on the right
' came quick successions of volleys from
; many hundred Mausers. Then came the
attempt to "rush" the works. But. the
Dons were doomed to disappointment.
Though in ordinarily overwhelming num
bers, they found everj' Pennsylvania!! like
a true "keystone,*! as firm in his place
as If the whole arch depended on him.
Then, with the aid of the gallant Cali
fornians and the Utah boys, who, with
O'Hara's Third Artillerymen, had hurried
through the mud and storm of rain and
shot and shell to the scene of battle, they
I swept the surprised Spaniards back to
their own lines. It was a strong object
lesson 'as to the stamina of the American
volunteer soldier, and the Spaniards did
not soon forget.
In this sharp fight the brunt of .the
attack fell on the Pennsj'lvanians, and
when reinforced they had but four rounds
of ammunition left to each man, showing
\ that they were not Idle. Many Spaniards |
! fell before their lire, and six of their own j
I boys were killed and ton wounded, In- j
| eluding Captain J. A. Lee and six of his
, men of Companj- B, which was in the
thickest of the fight.
This was a fair sample of the; fight the
boys of the Tenth made throughout,
though their losses were . fortunately
never again so heavy in any single en
gagement. ,
When the Filipino attack came on the
American lines on February 4, 1899. the
Tenth Regiment was on the left of Hale's
brigade, not far from Santa Mesa, where
the Nebraskans made the opening fight,
and they bore well their part in the four
days of fighting that followed, losing. two
killed and seven wounded. Among the
wounded were Major Brleser and Lieuten
i ant Albert Butterihore.
They started with Mac Arthur In , the
Caloocan-Calumpit movement and were

INSURRECTION OF
YAOUIS SPREADING
ST. LOUIS. Aug. I.â W. Mar
shall, a business man of this city,
who is well acquainted with the
Yaqui River Valley in Mexico and
who has just returned from that
region, gives some interesting informa
tion regarding the insurrection there.
He says the Indians live on land grant
ed them by the Mexican Government
at the close of the ten years' war in
1897. These lands, he states, are con
stantly being encroached upon by the
Mexicans, and this, in connection with
the excitement aroused by vigorous,
dancing which was going on when he
left there, has led to the outbreak.
Yaqui War Party Retiring From a Raid.
There are five military posts in the
I lower valley, which were garrisoned by
j about 1500 troops when Marshall was
I there two weeks ago. Fully. 2500 In
j dians are on the warpath and as they
j are splendid fighters and well armed,
i Mr. Marshall says the present Mexican
; force in their country is no match for :
them. Reinforcements are on the way
there, however, and a battery and some
sixty cases of arms are said to have
* passed through El Paso en route to the
scene of the trouble within the past
I three days. '
Late advices received from Guaymas,
1 State of Sonora, Mexico, confirm the
persistent rumors of an uprising of the
Yaquis, who are gathering in the moun
; tains and valleys about the river Me
: dano in large numbers.
On the morning of July 28 J. M. Rem
' ley, an American, and for many, years
, express agent at Hermosillo, while driv
ing to Alamos in a buggy in company
with Mr. Miller, an American photog
rapher, encountered the Indians In
large force and was killed, together
with his companion, and the buggy
| burned.
At Medano, on the river of that name,
| the Yaquis boldly attacked the ship
j ping, setting fire to launches â¢and
schooners and killing several persons,
j among them Aurelio F. Paredes, a
< prominent merchant, who was on board
j the schooner Alondra, about to leave
for Guaymas.
The Indians were finally repulsed by
the inhabitants, led by Commissioner
D. Abram Ayala. It is learned on good
authority that the Yaquis have been
laying in stores and ammunition for
several months, preparing for a final
i outbreak, and it is feared that they are
! well prepared for a long and stubborn
i campaign. ' ; ?7 :
At San Jose de Guaymas the 'excite
| ment runs high over an anticipated at
â  tack at that place, and uneasiness is
! felt over the effect the uprising will
have on the Indians about the river
i Mayo, who are in a state of restless
â¢ ness. . ..- - .
The Yaqui Indians inhabit the valley of
good time and all ready to applaud with
hand or tongue. It was announced from
the stage that the men were present and
who thej- were, and a round of applause
was their greeting. The orchestra played
national airs and every one applauded and
shouted and cheered until they were tired.
They cheered California and San Fran
cisco, the Orpheum, Colonel Mulford and
all their officers, but they hissed and hoot
ed at the name of Otis.
The men were furnished with tickets
through Colonel Mulford of the Nebraska
regiment. About 100 of those attending
last night were Utah men.

4- three bands of Yaquis heavily 4

long before the Mexican Government was
, thought of. .'.â¢;â 
When Mexico revolted and established
her independence the Yaquis refused to
recognize the new Government and pro
claimed their own Independence and au
tonomy. Since then the effort to obtain
land, just over the Oregon line, an after
noon lunch at Grants Pass and a late
supper at Roseburg. followed by a recep
tion. Breakfast next day will be given
the troops at Eugene, dinner at Salem,
and it Is expected that by 2 o'clock of the
third day the men will reach Portland.
The public ceremonies at Portland will
commence as soon as the troops arrive.
They will turn over their colors to the
State and then the regiment will formally
disband. This will not end matters, how
ever, for a reception to the soldiers will
follow. The whole population of Portland
will be the reception committee, and a
royal time is promised the troops. About
thirty of the men will go to Portland by
steamer, and nearly 100 have announced
their intention of remaining here; but
the remainder of the regiment will travel
home on the special train.
Captain I'resscott, Company D; First
Lieutenant Crowne, regimental adjutant,
and First Lieutenant Brazee, battalion ad
jutant, all of the Oregon regiment, have
been allowed captains' commissions in the
Thirty-fifth Infantry, now being recruit
ed on this coast, and they have received
orders to join their new command imme
diately.
The body of acting Hospital Steward
Charles H. Shelton, who died at Manila,
was sent to the Presidio yesterday, it
was burled with military honors.
The Nebraska regiment has settled down
into the routine of camp life again, al
though this time the routine is not a hard
one. There is only a very small guard
posted, and the men are required, to be
present but twice a. dayâ at reveille and
retreat. At the Utah camp the same rou
tine is followed. i . . â¢
The work of mustering out the new
comers has been started. The Nebraska
regiment will take the usual two weeks,
but the Utah men will be ready much
sooner. On the way over the officers of
the Utah battalion worked hard at the
battalion's papers, and as a consequence
they are practically ready. Before the
batteries left Manila they turned over to
the Third Artillery their guns and equip
ment, and this relieves them of a good
deal of work now. The commissary also
closed up his accounts, and the batteries
have only to get the men's papers in
proper form. This will be finished to-day.
One of General Shatter's horses took
fright at a body of troops yesterday and
Injured itself so badly It was shot. The
horse was being broken and for exercise
the teamster hitched it with another
horse to General Shafter's private car
riage and drove the team around the pa
rade ground.. The young horse shied at a
squad of soldiers, drilling near b>* and
pulled the carriage against a loaded
truck. There was a mix-up and the car
riage was wrecked and the driver was
thrown out. The half-broken colt was
thrown among the wreckage in such a
way as to break both fore leg...
News was received yesterday by Cap
from them recognition of the authority
and law of Mexico has led to frequent
collisions between them and the Govern
ment troops; pitched battles have been
fought and though generally beaten by
superior forces and forced to retreat for
â¢ the time, they have never yet been sub
dued.
The whole population does not number
over 20,000, but they are fine .specimens
of physical manhood and good fighters,
as their defeat of General Gareia's army
In June, 1886, with a loss of 400 men killed,
including the general himself, well at
tests. ' "â  â  â  â *â '-'
Their method of fighting Is one taught
them by nature and experience. When
beaten they retreat into the almost in
accessible fastnesses of the Sierra Madres,
whither the Government troops dare not
follow them, and there await the depart
ure of the troops, when they again de
scend and clear out the people who have
established themselves on their lands.
The Y'aquis are good agriculturists when
allowed to till their farms in- peace, and
their valley being rich and fertile has
tempted covetous men with little regard
for right to take advantage of the pe
culiar features of the Mexican laws in
regard to taking up land and file claims
on the Y'aqul holdings. These, of course,
understanding little of law and moved by
a sense of injustice, have resisted the
seizure, and troops have been called out
to enforce the lawâ that is. put the new
claimant in possession of the Yaqui land
taken under the law. The Yaquis have
stood together and made good fights after
their fashion, and when compelled to do
so retired, only to return when the troops
were withdrawn to take forcible posses
sion of their own again. This has been
going on for many years. Formerly they
had but few firearms, but when the So
nora railroad to Guaymas was built they
furnished a large proportion of the labor
ers, and with the money earned Win
chester rifles were purchased, with which
they have been much more formidable
antagonists than before and are more
conscious of their own strength.
Their last uprising in 1896 was followed
by a treaty between the head men of the
tribe, who took the direction of affairs
after King Cajiml's death, and the Mexi
can Government, in which certain pledges
and guarantees were given In regard' to
their titles and possession of the lands
claimed by them. The ignoring of those
pledges by the land grabbers, with semi
official approval, is what has caused the
present outbreak. ' ....'.

of War at 10:45 a. m. to-day. The cere- |
mony ocurred in the large offlce of the j
Secretary of War, in the presence of Sec- j
retaries Gage and Hitchcock, Assistant
Secretary Meiklejohn, a large number of I
army officers in uniform and other em
ployes and officials. The oath was admin
istered by Judge Cole of the Supreme
Court of the District of Columbia.
Secretary Alger arrived at the War De
partment at 10:40, accompanied by Mr.
Root, for whom he had called in his car- ;
riage. They went immediately to the !
Secretary's private office, where were
Secretaries Gage and Hitchcock, and j
were soon joined by Adjutant General
Corbin and Major Hopkins, the latter be
ing the military secretary of Secretary
Alger. A moment later Assistant Secre
tary Meiklejohn and Judge Cole entered
and were formally presented to the new !
Secretary. The latter's commission,
bearing date to-day, was in possession of j
Adjutant General Corbin.
By this time a number of army officers
had gathered in the main office, and Mr.
Root and Secretary Alger and other mem
bers of the party had entered the room.
It was 10:45 when Mr. Root stood up and
took the oath of office. Judge Cole then
addressed hifn as "Mr. Secretary' and
shook hands and congratulated him. Gen- ,
eral Alger next advanced and shook his
hands most cordially, saying with evident
feeling: -'".*". -â 'â â¢/ ".- - ' , ;''**'
"With all my heart I congratulate you i
and the administration. You will nnd
around you here men who will help In ;
the arduous duties of your position. May
God bless you and give you strength. '
Secretary Gage then stepped forward
and congratulated Secretary Root. He
was followed by Secretary Hitchcock,
Assistant Secretary Meiklejohn. Ad
jutant General Corbin and Chief Clerk ,
Schofield.
General Alger picked up the commie
sion signed by the President and attest
ed by the Secretary of State, appointing
Mr. Root Secretary of War.
"Here is your commission," he said
with a smile, handing It to Mr. Root, "In
which you lose your identity and become
â¢Mr. Secretary.' I go back to become a
sovereign citizen of the United States and
become 'Mr. Alger.' "
"I sincerely wish it were the other
way," said Mr. Root as he accepted the
parchment.
Then the officers were presented to Sec- j
retarv Root by Victor L. Mason, the j
confidential secretary of the Secretary of
War. As soon as they were introduced j
they passed on and shook hands with
General Alger. Nearly all stopped to ex
press their regrets upon his retirement
and wish him success in the future. They
also thanked him for his consideration
and many acts of kindness and for his
uniform courtesy during the time they j
had been associated with him.
General Miles appeared with his staff in j
the full dress uniform of the major general !
commanding the army. He stopped to !
talk to Secretary Root for some time long- j
er than any of the others. v -
Following the presentation of the officers
the civilian officials and clerks of the de- |
partment came in and shook hands with
Secretary Root and said farewell to the !
retiring Secretary.
Secretary Gage, before leaving the room, '
went- up to General Alger, shook him cor- 1
dially by the hand, bidding him good-by. j
General Alger left at 12:45 o'clock to-day
for his home In Detroit. 'â â ~%<u ,^< s _id
The last official act of Secretary Alger
was to sign the requisition for an allot
ment of $20,000 for transports. Secretary
Alger intended that his last act should
be the signing of the order directing Ma
jor Charles Bird, assistant quartermaster,
to accompany the transport Thomas to
Manila when she waa ready. He signed
such an order, but the other business was
presented a few minutes later.
Secretary Root did not perform any of
ficial business to-day. As General Alger
is Secretary and draws the salary for to
day lt was thought best to avoid any legal
complications by having the business of
the department performed by Mr. Meikle
john as acting secretary. I

Democratic Leader Does not See How
Any Believer in Christianity
Could Favor Forcible
Annexation.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Aug, I.â Colonel Wil
liam J. Bryan discusses the Philippine
question in this week's Independent.
He says in part:
The Declaration of Independence asserts
that Governments derive their just pow
ers from the consent of the governed, ana
this is the doctrine which we have ad
hered to for more than a century.
if the doctrine set forth in the Declara
tion of Independence is sound, how can
we rightfully acquire sovereignty -oyer
the Filipinos by a war of conquest? If the
doctrine set forth in the Declaration of
Independence is sound, how can we
rightfully purchase sovereignty from a
Spanish sovereign whose title we disputed
in Cuba and whose rebellious subjects wo
armed in the Philippines?
In the beginning of the Spanish war
Congress denied that our nation had any
thought of extending its territory by war.
If we then had no thought of securing by
conquest new territory in the western
hemisphere, why should we now think of
securing in the eastern hemisphere new
races for subjugation? 7 * ;i
It ls surprising that any believer in self
government should favor forcible annexa
tion, but still more surprising that any
one who believes in the Christian religion
should urge the substitution of force for
reason in the extension of our nation's
influence. -.'â¢; , ,
If we adopt the gunshot gospel in the
Philippines how long will it be before
that principle will be transplanted in
American soil? So long as our arguments
are addressed to the reason and the heart
our progress is sure; but can we, without
danger to Christianity, desert to the an
cient plan of injecting religion into the
body through bullet holes? __
The question is frequently asked, what
can we do? Nearly two months elapsed
between the signing of the treaty and the
beginning of hostilities in the Philippines.
During that time the President and Con
gress might have given to the Filipinos
the same assurance of independence that
was given to the Cubans. Such assurance
would have prevented bloodshed.
If the President is not willing to take
the responsibility of enforcing the doc
trine set forth in the Declaration of In
dependence he can call Congress together
and let it take the responsibility. A spe
cial session would be less expensive than
the war, not to speak of the principles
involved. ________________
WAGES MAY BE RESTORED.
Naval Board to Reopen the Mara
Island Case.
VALLEJO, Aug. I.â The Secretary of
the Navy has authorized the board of
wages at the Mare Island navy yard tor
take additional testimony in the matter
of the adjustment of wages at the yard.
The workmen's pay had been cut by tha
board at its last meeting, and a vigor-,
ous protest to Washington followed, tha
action of the Secretary of the Navy be-,
ing the result. .'-';;' 7 '.â¢-.-'
The board will meet to-morrow after
noon at 2 o'clock and will hear testi
mony from the workmen and from
those -who have been active in their in
terests. State Senator J. J. Luchsinger,
who has espoused the cause of the men,
will be one of the principal witnesses.
The action of the Secretary of tha
Navy virtually reopens the case. The
outcome is still in doubt, but the men
hope it will result in a restoration of
the former schedule. ; :

POLITICAL CRISIS
IN BRUSSELS
Cabinet Has Resigned in
a Body.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
BRUSSELS. Aug. The constitu
tional crisis reached its second stage
to-day by the resignation of President
M. Van den Perboom.
W r ith his fall the ultramontane party
has been overthrown and the turn has
come of the moderate Catholics, who
probably will soon be superseded by a
liberal, semi-socialist Cabinet.
Belgium is going to try proportional
representation in order that the Parlia
ment may be an absolute mirror of
public opinion. At least such is the
platform of the new Cabinet which M.
D,Pmet de Naeyer is called upon to
form]
The question is whether the present
I Parliament provides a sufficient ma
jority for passing such a reform bill.
There is also a split on the same sub
ject in the Liberal and Socialist oppo
sition, the Socialists wishing a ple
biscite beforehand or that the repre
sentation of the minority be accom
panied by universal suffrage. The out
re-me may, therefore, be a triumphant
alliance of the moderate Catholics and
Liberals at the expense of the extreme
i^r tics â¢'.---â Â».' '-.-'-
A vfo'ent Socialist street agitation
has made this a time of great anxiety
for the King. His Majesty has been
instrumental in bringing about the re
tirement of M. Van den Perboom. This
was wise en his part and probably
more wisdom may be expected from
him in the anxious moments about to

LOS ANGELES. Aug. I.â Will Knippen

wife knows nothing of his whereabouts, j
and anxious creditors are equally in the .
dark. Mrs. Knippenberg thinks he went
to San Francisco on July 8. A close friend
Of "Crimson Rim" says that his departure ;
occurred the following day. Instead of
j going to San Francisco Knippenberg
I started for Chicago.
Mrs. Knippenberg is sure she is deserted
j by the husband she married ten years ago,
j and that the maintenance of her two boys
1 rests upon her alone. She has been joined ,
i by her father, Mr. Maxwell of Indianapo
; lis, and expects to return with him to the
parental roof.
The action of Knippenberg is a surprise
i to all who knew him. The manner of his
! going is a shock to those to whom he
owed money. Some say the aggregate of j
his indebtedness is $2000.
The financial methods of Knippenberg
subjected him to criticism even from his
best friends. Through the First National
Bank he drew a draft upon the Hecla
Consolidated Mining Company of Mon
tana for $250. Because of his being
known he was able to receive the casn
without waiting for returns from Mon
tana. In due time the draft came back â 
dishonored. Not - of this fact, sent by
the bank to Mrs. Knippenberg. was the
first certain proof that her husband's de- ;

fore action could be taken by the bank a

SPANISH TROOPS
WERE STARVING
Testimony of Toral
and Pareja.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
MADRID. Aug. I.â The second session
of the court-martial of Generals Toral
and Pareja, who were charged with sur
rendering Santiago de Cuba to the Amer
icans without having exhausted all means
of defense," took place to-day.
General Pareja, in his defense, said
the garrison of the city of Santiago de
Cuba lacked food, many of the soldiers
having died of hunger. Previously, how
ever, he added, the troops fought bravely
and many officers and men were killed.
In addition the hospitals lacked medicines.
The general read several .telgrams ex
changed between the authorities at
Washington and Major General Shafter,
the latter showing himself confident of
forcing the surrender of Santiago de
Cuba.
General Toral made a similar defense.
He said Santiago de Cuba was defense
less and that it was impossible to hold
out longer. He read a telegram sent him
by General Blanco, who. after consulting
with the authorities at Madrid, approved
of the capitulation. Another Spanish offi
cer testified that when he entered Santi
ago he found three-quarters of the troops
sick.
General Rubl gave testimony to the ef
' feet that further resistance would have
I been equivalent to trie death of the re
j mainder of the troops.
Colonel Ordonn-ea testified that he was
i blockaded and therefore did not take part
! in the conference where it was decided
!to surrender. He "said he believed all
| means of resistance had been exhausted;
! though perhaps the capitulation might
, have been avoided by an attempt to break
' through the enemy s lines, which would
! have caus.d much bloodshed. However.
the spirit of the troops was weakened
; when they lost all hope of outside help.
Lieutenant General Pando, who was in
* charge of the military operations in Cuba.
i testified as . to his regretting that the
I recommendations made by him before
leaving Santiago had not been acted upon.
' as Santiago then had sufficient ammuni
â¢ tion except for the artillery. He disap
proved the decisions of the generals at
Havana, who. he asserted, to succeed
should have reinforced Santiago.
General Blanco, who' succeeded General
Weyler as Governor General of Cuba, nar
rated the events which transpired at the
beginning of the war. He said he had
never advised the capitulation of Santi
ago, but favored a strong resistance. The
Government, he declared, had accepted
the terms of the United States without
discussion, and when he telegraphed to
General Toral it was too late. Santiago,
he added, had far from an insufficient
garrison. ______ _____ ___________
GENERAL AXLINE WILL
PROSECUTE BOYCOTTERS
Merchants Who Refuse to Serve Sol
diers to Be Summoned Before
a Judge Advocate.
CLEVELAND, Aug. I.â Adjutant Gen
eral Axllne said to-night that he had
found a way to smash the boycott, so far
as it affected the troops. Every day since
the soldiers arrived they have been sub
jected to petty annoyances because of the
refusal of merchants to sell them neces
sary supplies. General Axllne pointed out
the other day that these merchants could
be prosecuted under the civil rights law,
which requires all keepers of inns, restau
rants and places of public amusement and
accommodation to serve all people alike.
To-night General Axllne declarer] that If
any more complaints of discrimination
against soldiers came to him he would
appoint a judge advocate to proceed
against the merchants and i.ius seek to
bring them to time.
There seems to be a disposition to stir
up trouble among the employes of the Lit
tle Consolidated Company. More than half
of them have been initiated into the union
of the Big Consolldated's former em
ployes, and a dispatch has been sent to
Senator M. A. Hanna, who is in France,
asking him if he, as president of the Lit
tle Consolidated Company, will recognize
the union. No answer has yet been re
ceived to the cablegram.
A prominent physician to-night gave an
instance of the way in which the boycott
is being enforced. He says he was called
to see a little girl who was dying. He
was met by two men, >vfio told him he
had better not attend the child, as its
father was a "scab." He replied that they
ought to serve notice of the boycott on
the Almighty and Inform him that they
would not go to heaven, for the child
would be there ln a short time.

Vice President of San Domingo, who has taken charge of the Government as
President and formed a Cabinet.
HAVANA, Aug. I.â l had a conversation
with Gomez to-day in regard to the ban
Domingo revolution. In answer to my
question would he accept the Presidency
if the revolution was successful, he stated
that San Domingo was his native land;
that he would be glad to see her free, but
that he was an old man now and had had
enough fighting; but if the revolutionary
states that his only property is house
hold goods, valued at $140. which he
claims to be exempt. The heaviest cred- :
itors are as follows: The German Artis

he assigned in Ohio three and a half years
ago but that the courts did not grant him
relief Therefore he took advantage of
the national bankruptcy law and hied the
bill in this State.
LAST OF THE "QUEEN'S
KISS SOCIETY" DIES
Was a Member of the Band Who
Paid a Shilling to Kiss
the Princess.
Special Cable to Th" Call and the New Tork
Herald. Copyrighted, 1WÂ». By James Gor
don Bennett.
LONDON, Aug. I.â There has Just
died in Essex the last survivor of the
famous band of girls who formed
themselves into the "Queen's Kiss So
ciety."
The society had its origin when the
Queen was only about 1 year old. The
little Princess was being wheeled about
the park by her nurse, when she was
suddenly surrounded by a group of
laughing school girls, who recognized
the royal infant and insisted upon kiss
her, microbes having not then been
discovered.
The nurse's scruples soon yielded to
the persuasion of the shillings which
the girls displayed. Each maiden of
fered a coin for a kiss. Permission be
ing granted, the royal baby was almost
smothered with the children's hearty
caresses, while stowed away in the
back of the perambulator were forty
shillings, which were the nurse's kiss
ing fees
There was, however, a great commo
tion in the Duchess of Kent's house
be .Id when the affair became known,
and the erring maid was deposed from
' her proud position. The maidens sub
! sequently formed a .society and when
j the young Princess became Queen, they
I recalled the incident. "We are." they
wrote, "the first of your subjects from
! whom your Majesty received homage."
On the occasion of important festivi
ties from time to time they addressed
expressions of allegiance to the Queen,
but the members have gradually died.
With the death of this aged lady the
"Society of the Queen's Kiss" has
: passed from existence.
COLORADO SMELTERS
ARE STILL CLOSED
Owners Will Not Accept Scale Set by
the Board of. Arbitra
tion.
DENVER, Aug. The operating com
mittee of the American Smelting and Re
fining Company at a meeting to-day de
cided not to reopen the smelters in this
city and Pueblo at the scale recommended
by the State Board of Arbitration. The
committee published a card in which it
says:
"The decision of the Board of Arbitra
tion cannot be accepted by the American
Smelting and Refining Company because
ii is unreasonable and unjust. The board
has undertaken to arbitrarily Interfere
with Industrial conditions In Colorado, in
a way which cannot fall if persisted in
to bring about great hardships to the in
dustries already established and to surely
prevent new Industries from establishing
themselves here."
It is reported that the company will re
open the Omaha-Grant smelter next week
it enough men can be found who will ac
cept the wages offered. The smeltermen's
union will post a guard around this
smelter and endeavor to dissuade men
from working there, as was successfully
done at the Globe smelter last week.

Nickel Machines Doomed.
LOS ANGELES. Aug. I.â Judge Smith,
In the Superior Court, handed down a de
cision to-day upholding the decision of i
the lower court in the nickel-ln-the-slot
machlne case brought against Max Cohen,
a cigar dealer. The decision ls to the ef
fect that the city has the right to pass
an ordinance prohibiting the use of the I
slot machines. 1
party was in earnest he would aid them.
He would accept the Presidency if there
was no other way of gaining their free
dom, but he did not want it. His only
wish was to see Cuba free and happy and
then to settle down in peace and quiet
with his family. Indications here, how
ever, are that Gomez's friends will force
the office on him.
BRUSH APPLIED
TO McNAUGHTON
Normal Trustees Find
Him Guiltless.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, Aug. I.â The Board of Trus
tees of the State Normal School complet
ed its investigation of Principal James
McNaughton this morning and passed
lengthy resolutions exonerating him of
the charges of Immorality, incompetency
and lack of character.
There was a decreased attendance when
the proceedings opened. Attorney Pat
ton presented the answer of Professor Mc- â 
Naughton to the supplemental report hied
by the alumni investigating committee
yesterday. It stated that the animus
against Professor McNaughton at Tempe,
Ariz., arose in 1888, when he expelled T.
G. Holmes, a student, for persistent gam
bling and drunkenness. A number of let
ters and telegrams were read speaking
highly of McNaughton. Two of the writ
ers were J. H. McClintock and Ben L.
Gillett. secretaries of the Normal School
boards of Arizona.
Attorney Patton made a plea for Prin
cipal McNaughton. He urged the trus
tees to adopt resolutions exonerating Mc-
Naughton.
The board then retired Into an executive
session. After two hours' deliberation .1
adjourned, leaving with the secretary the
following resolutions, which it was said
had been adopted by a unanimous vote:
Whereas, A petition ley the commit
tee In behalf of the Alumni Association
of this school has been presented to
this board praying for an investigation
of the past records and standing of
Jam s McNaughton and his capability
to discharge the duties of president of
this boot; and
Whereas, Professor McNaughton has
filed herein his request in writing that
this beard fully examine and investi
| gate said matters; and
Whereas. We have received written
evidence on behalf of said petition,
and on behalf of said Dr. McNaughton,
and as fully and carefully investigated
said matters as the time and circum
stances would permit. We find that cer
tain charges were filed against Pro
fessor McNaughton at Council Bluffs,
lowa, while he was Superintendent 0.. .
Schools of said city. That the Board
of Trustees before whom the same was
tiled refused to fix a time for or
to examine said charges. That prior
thereto Professor McNaughton had
been eight successive times elected
Superintendent of Schools of said city
by a unanimous vote of the board, and
that said charges and trouble arose
In of certain controversies and per
sor McNaughton at Council Bluffs,
,-.i, while he was Superintendent o*
mo'.s of said city, 'that the Board
Trustees before whom tlio same waa
d refused to fix a time for or
examine said charges. That pri'ir
â¢reto Professor McNaughton had
â n eight successive times elected
jerintendent of Schools >ef said city
a unanimous vote of the board, and
v said charges and trouble arose
; of certain controversies and per
sonal differences and that his superln
tendency of said schools had therefore
been successful and long continued.
That immediately following his resig
nation he was chosen president of the
State Normal School ot North Dakota
which position he occupied satisfac
torily and successfully for four years.
That while in said position in North
Dakota said charges against him as to
said Council Bluffs controversy were
brought up and considered and ex
amined by the trustees of said school
and he was, after such investigation,
fully sustained, exonerated and ac
quitted by said Board of Trustees of
any fault or wrong in said Council
Bluffs matter. That Professor Mc-
Naughton removed, after four years in
said North Dakota Normal School, to
Tempe, Ariz., where he was elected
and acted as president of the Norma!
School of Arizona at that place for
four years, from which place he came
to Â«his school. With his application
for the position of president of, this
! school Professor McNaughton present
ed Indorsements of many of the promi
nent educators and prominent men of
the sections where his life had been
spent. While some bitter contro
versies have arisen, and some testi
mony of those opposed to Professor
McNaughton and not friendly to his
educational methods or career has
been introduced, and has received our
careful consideration, and while we
regret the existence of such contro
versies and criticisms, we rind, upon
the whole case, that the charges as
to any immorality or lack of integrity
on the part of Professor McNaughton
were wholly unsustalned. That ne is
indorsed and recommended in such a
wav by eminent educators in the East
where he has lived, and from Arizona,
that we feel that he ought to be able
to successfully preside over this
school, especially if unhampered by
factions, unreasonable or ill-advised
opposition.
We therefore find the charges un
sustained and regret exceedingly that
unwarranted reports and charges have
been circulated to the great detri
ment of Dr. McNaughton and we tear
to the injury of the school.
We therefore call upon all friends of
the school, and especially of the fac
ulty and pupils thereof, and the
Alumni Association, to Join In an
honest and earnest effort to re
establish harmony and bring renewed
success to this, tne oldest-established
and 'we believe to be the most pros
perous normal school in our State,
Upon our part our efforts will be un
remitting to bring harmony and suc
cess, ana with the assistance of others
whose interest, if not responsibilities.
FIFTY THOUSAND
ORPHANS IN CUBA
Destitute Children of the RecoQ
centrados Who Must Be
Provided For.
NEW TORK, Aug. I.â article by Miss Clara Barton on the/ sub- |J
ject of the "Cuban Reconcentrados," will be published in the next mum- 3
ber of the Independent. 2
Miss Barton says there are now in Cuba 50,000 destitute orphans. C
children of reconcentrados who have in the last few years died of star- Â£
vation and want. These children are scattered throughout nearly, every 3
city and town of sufficient size and importance to receive the driven-out *$
country people. They are not children of low, doubtful origin, many C
of them being of the best Cuban families. The reconcentrados were |
largely the country people of propertyâ farmers and small planters. 4
Miss Barton says: "The Cubans are not responsible for the destitu- *
tion of these children. When the starving reconcentrados were driven *Â£
into the towns the residents divided food ; and clothing with them and <
then divided again and again, but there was a point at which they had <
to stop giving. Only for the Cuban rations distributed by our army <
it would be a sorry lookout for those helpless little ones. They range i
in number from thirty and fifty and even one hundred in the various <
towns, utterly homeless and no one has the least personal interest in i
them or responsibility fcr them. The towns people still do what they <
can, but their main dependence is begging from the passengers of every Â»
passing train. '
"To one who knows only ordinary poverty and destitution the aspect ,<
of these children, as found, is often terrifying. It was a subject for .
both humane and medical study, and together the Red Cross surgeons 1
and trained purses thought out a system which, simply followed out as Â
it is now being pursued, will, we believe, in less than six months trans- <
form these thousands of hapless renegades into clean, wholesome, welV- \
ordered children, learning to work, to read and to forget the dreadful 3
lives of pain, want and woe they went through. '.
"The system is this: Finding it impossible to take the time to act- .
tempt to follow the customary methods of making up large asylums in j
the great cities, as the conditions of these children meant life and death ,;
to themselves and to others, it was decided to gather them up just â¢
where they were, making smaller asylums of the plainest and simplest -
kind, interesting the authorities and the people of the city at all times <
in the movement, securing their full co-cperation, providing for all ;
wants and making it possible for the people of the towns to look after -â 
them as their own, with 'our continued care and oversight. .;
"The women regard the asylums as something quite their own. In <;
nearly every large town a young ladies' club is formed, from which ;
two go each day to assist and to teach the children. This practice com- :
menced with the Young Ladies' Club of Catalina. which body of twenty
had held itself intact through all the terrible years of the war. These
young ladies volunteered at once to help care for the children, proffer- 1
ing their continuous dally service in the asylum." ;
ought to be equal to our own, we con
fldentlv hope for successful results.
The result of the inquiry is not at all
satisfying to the majority of the people
of this city. who denounce it as a job or
whitewashing. That the board intended
to acquit McNaughton is evidenced from
the fact that at a meeting last night, be
fore the Investigation had been com
pleted, the board passed a resolution giv
ing McNaughton full control of 'tie
school and also the assignment and re
assignment of teachers.

DUEL ON A STEEP
MOUNTAIN SIDE
Wounded Man Grapples With His
poe and Tfyey Roll to
the Bottom.
ELKO, Nev., An*. I.â News reached Elko to-day of a desperate
shooting affray near Mardis, ninety miles from here, on Sunday morn
ing between W. A. Bacon and J. L. Freitas, prominent sheep men of this
county. Freitas was shot twice in the leg and once in the neck. He
was brought here for medical treatment.
The trouble grew out of a dispute over land used as sheep ranges.
The shooting took place on the si.l c of a steep mountain. Bacon shot
three times with a revolver, each shot hitting his adversary. Freitas
shot once with a rifle and missed his mark.
After the shooting the men grappled and rolled to the bottom of the
mountain, where the wounded man landed on top and struck Bacon
several times with his fists before being separated by sheep herders.
Bacon came to Elko and g*ave himself up to the Sheriff and was re
leased from custody on bonds. Freitas probably will recover, but he
will lose one leg.

SPAIN WILL SELL THE
FLOATING DOCK
Navy Department Will Resubmit Its
Former Bid, Which Will Prob
ably Be Accepted.
WASHINGTON. Aug. I.â Spain's float
ing dock, which has tee en the subject of.
much controversy, will probably become
the property of the United States. â  Lieu
i tenant Luclen Young, in charge of the
! naval station at Havana, informed the
; Navy Department to-day that the Spanish
I Government lead changed its mind about
| taking the dock back to home waters,
and had readvertlsed it- for sale, bids to
1..- opened on July 28.
Rear Admiral Bndicott informed me
that the Navy Department would resub
mit its bid of $285,000 for the dock. As the
dock had been advertised for sale at least
half a dozen times and the United States
was the only bidder In each instance, it
is assumed there will be no other bidders
the next time and that the dock will be
awarded to the United States. The dock

COLLISION IN THE FOG
OFF THE IRISH COAST
Cunard Liner Cephalonia Struck an
Unknown Sailing Vessel, Which
May Have Sunk.
QUEENSTOWN. Aug. I.â The Cunard
line steamer Cephalonia, Captain Pierce,
from Boston for Liverpool, which arrived i
here to-day at 9:55 a. m., was densely be- j
fogged during the night.
Between 2 and 3 o'clock in the morning, !
while nearing the Irish coast, she col- \
lided with a Bailing vessel supposed to be i
a bark. The vessels separated quickly,
and a boat was launched from the
steamer, but all search for the sailing
craft was unavailing. The Cephalonia
was not damaged.

Wou'd End the Conflict Between the

â â¦ â
Special Cable to The Call and the New York
Herald. Copyrighted, lSi'9, by James Gor
don Bennett.
ROME, Aug. I.â The interview with
General Ricciotti Garibaldi, published
in the Herald recently, caused great ex
citement at the Vatican and much an
noyed the Cardinals belonging to the
group which has not abandoned all
hope of reconciliation with the mon
archy. The group comprising Cardinals
devoted to the triple alliance met yes
terday.
1 ; A member of the sacred college, who
I belongs neither to this nor the oppos
ing faction, and who formerly was
1 Nuncio in a great capital, and is thor
] oughly familiar with the complications
â  1 and difficulties of the diplomatic posi
] tion of the papacy, gave me his opinion
| on the question raised by the interview.
â¢ "With the exception of a few nar
| row-minded men," he said, "every one
â¢ among the higher Italian clergy is con
. vinced that tempera! power such as
existed before 1870 has had its day and
; that an absolute restoration of the
status quo would be a calamity for the
church of Rome.
"What was thirty years ago is Im
possible now. People are accustomed
to lay institutions which imply many
things Incompatible with clerical gov
ernment. We are convinced that such
government would not last long or exist
amid struggles such as disturbed the
reign of Pius IX.
"Practically only the Spanish and
Portuguese episcopates are uncompro
mising temporalists. It is no lack of
respect to them to declare that the
leading forces upon which the Holy
Father can reckon to be found are to
day in America and France, and the
tendencies we have rather, come to con
sider are those of the American and
French episcopates."
"Does this mean that renunciation of
: temporal power has become a possi
'< bility?"
"No; whatever has been said and
I written, the Pope can only be truly
\ free and independent in territory which
belongs to him nominally, If not ex
clusively.
"Many Italian and foreign prelates
; think that a practical solution of this
serious problem is to be found only in
; a republic, which, organized on federal
lines, could create in Rome a system
of nominal sovereignty for the Pope
. i which would insure his effective inde
i pendence without infringing on the
principle of -national integrity. As
General Garibaldi has well said, no
../compromise is possible, with â  the Pope.
Who cannot tolerate the presence- of a
crowned sovereign in Rome, 7* " , â¢
"There is nothing to lead to the con
clusion that among the Cardinals who
may be called upon to rule the church
there is a single one capable of re
â  nouncing the legitimate claims of the
I Holy See in favor of a usurping
dynasty.
"From this point of view it might be
supposed that understanding between
General Garibaldi and the Vatican was
an accomplished fact."
I have reason to believe that things
have not gone so far as may have- been
supposed. I know that Garibaldi, be
fore leaving for South America, saw
several Cardinals who occupy highest
positions in the hierarchy among
â  others Cardinal Parocchi and, perhaps,
Cardinal Rampolla also. From these
conversations arose the conviction that !
the Italian democracy was no longer
imbued with anti-clericalism, and that
the Italian prelacy and episcopate on
j their side, enlightened by the teachings
of Leo XIII, no longer entertain their
I former prejudices against republican
; institutions.
I think that an understanding will
be reached, but for the moment it is
I no more than a pious desire shared by,
a great number of Catholics.

BEAUTIFUL HOME FOR
THE SACRAMENTO ELKS
SACRAMENTO, Aug. 1. â Negotiations have not yet been completed for
the transfer of the handsome residence of Mrs. E. B. Crocker to the
local lodge of Elks, but it is understood the deed will be delivered as
soon as the signature of Mrs. Amy Gillig, daughter of Mrs. Crocker,
now in New York, is attached to the instrument.
The residence of Mrs. Crocker at Third and O streets has long been re
garded as one of the handsomest in in the city. It sets well back from the
street upon a high terrace, and the surroundings are most beautiful. On
the same block and connected with it by a covered bridge is the Crocker
Art Gallery, presented some years ago by Mrs. Crocker to the city, and
which has been the scene of many brilliant entertainments.
It is probable that eventually the property will be established as a
home under the control of the national organization of Elks, but the needs
of the local lodge will, of course, be first considered.
This will have been the third manifestation of munificence on the part
of Mrs. Crocker in this city, the gift of the art gallery and the Old Ladies-
Home being among her benefactions. .

ROADS BENEFITED BY
USE OF CRUDE OIL
! Supervisors of Santa Barbara County
Satisfied With the Ex
periment.
SANTA BARBARA, Aug. I.â The Coun
! ty Board of Supervisors has adopted the
j use of oil for sprinkling all the roads of
I the county and the plan has proved very
I satisfactory. The oil, mixing with the
, dust, forms a hard bed similar to an as
phalt pavement and it serves two pur-
I posesâone to lay the dust and another
! to prevent mud during the wet season.
Yesterday F. W. Mat tern, who claims
i to have a patent on a device for sprink
; ling roads with oil and, incidentally, to
i have a patent on oil used for such pur-
I poses, demanded from the Board of Su
j pervisors that they pay him $15 a mile for
every mile sprinkled with oil or $250 .or
j the use of his patent. He claims that it
was with much difficulty that he secured
j a patent on oil used for such purposes.
Chairman Deadrick of the Board of Su
pervisors refused to listen to his de-
I mands, thinking that one might obtain a
I patent on salt or fresh water used for
street sprinkling purposes as well as on
oil. Mattern says that unless the board
j listens to his demands and pays him ins
just right he will attempt to enjoin the
Supervisors from further use of oil for
sprinkling purposes. ;.- -.-, .*.<.

Believed to Have Been Car

STRICT PMNTII
Three New Cases and One Death
the Day's Record at Hampton.
Troops to Be Moved.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 1. â Surgeon
General Wyman is much encouraged
to-night by' the reports from the Hamp
ton Soldiers' Home and surrounding
places.
There is no evidence whatever that
yellow fever has spread beyond the
original point of infection, and each
day that passes without some evidence
of its presence being discovered at
some other point makes it more certain
that it was not carried out of the neigh
borhood of the home before the present
impassable sanitary cordon was estab
lished. Reports received from Surgeon
White, in charge of the Marine Hospital
service at Hampton and surrounding
places, indicate that there have been
three new cases and one death to-day,
bringing the total number of cases up
to forty and the number of deaths up
to eight.
Surgeon White says there is little
doubt of the infection of the village of
Phoebus. He says there is one case
there which is under observation and
is probably yellow fever.
Surgeon General Wyman had expected
to learn that the disease had gotten into
Phoebus. It is a little village imme
diately adjoining the Soldiers' Home
grounds. There are numerous saloons
and other places of resort in the village
that were much frequented by the old
soldiers all the time the fever was de
veloping in the home. For this, reason
Dr. Wyman says it cannot be said that
the disease has spread to Phoebus, for
it is there. It was established before
its first discovery inside the home, and
Phoebus is really a part of the same
center of Infection as the home itself.
Reports have been received from the
Marine Hospital surgeons at Norfolk,
Portsmouth, Newport News and Old
Point Comfort, showing that no one has
been found at either of these places
who had been exposed to the infection.
This still further encourages the hope
that the disease will be kept witnln
the limits of the home and Phoebus.
Dr. Woodward, health officer of
Washington, has discovered two old
soldiers in this city who were at the
Hampton Home during the time when
the disease was developed. They have
been subjected to a careful examina
tion and are apparently free from any
symptoms of fever, but in order to
minimize danger, they have been iso
lated in the detention camp which was
established last winter for the deten
tion of persons; who had been exposed
to smallpox..
The War Department and the Marine
Hospital service are co-operating to
get the artillery troops at Fort Mon
roe away from that neighborhood with
the least possible delay. Quartermas
ter McCaulley at Philadelphia has
made all arrangements for the trans
portation of troops to Battery Point,
Delaware. A special train is to be run
down to Cape Charles City, across iri
a steamer.
Dr. Pettus, the Marine Hospital sur
geon in charge of the military reserva
tion, will carefully inspect all men be
fore they leave the fort, and any that
are suspected of being infected will be
detained. The entire command will be
kept under close observation by medi
cal officers while in transit to Battery
Point, and upon their arrival there they
will be isolated from all other soldiers
at that post and will be carefully ob
served until the expiration of eleven
days, which is considered the extreme
period of incubation for yellow fever.
Dr. Wyman does not believe there is
any possibility of the soldiers carrying
the disease with them and spreading it
in the neighborhood of Battery Point,
for they will be so carefully watched
by the medical officers of the army that
if the fever should break out among
them it would not get outside of the
command.
NEWPORT NEWS, Aug. I.â is not
considered that there is any danger of
the disease spreading to this place, al
though all suspicious cases will be
closely watched. People are going and
coming here as usual and there is very
littlt excitement.

COLUMBUS, Ohio. Aug. I.â The eensa
ftioh of the second day's meeting of the
Orand Circuit races was the performance
of Ace in the 2:10 pace (unfinished): The
Canadian horse surprised even his warm

his speed, winning the third heat of the
race in the fast time of - 05%-
It was an ideal day fur racing --nil the
track was fast. The sport was iptito In
contrast to that of yesterday, each event
furnishing some interest and excitement.
Then- was a long delay in starting the
first race, the 2:17 trot, occasioned by the
drawing of Pilot Evans. This horse,
which was formerly owned by M. W.
Janes of Williard. Kans., had been pur
chased the previous night after pools had
hern sold on the race by N. W. Hubin
ger. the owner of Royal Baron, which was
â entered in the same race. As Hublnger
could not, under the rules, start both
horses. Pilot Evans was drawn. A pro
test was at once raised by those who had
bought pools, as the gelding had bet con
sidered a factor In the race. A compro
mise was reached by declaring .iff all

tive heats with scarcely any effort.
The 2:10 pace proved to be an Interest

Ace sold favorite In the pools, with The
Maid a close second. Ace was heavily

Lewis has raided the track twice during
the summer and secured the indictment
of a number of bookmakers on a charge
of gambling, but the work has been done
at his own expense. The board to-day
refused to vote an appropriation of $2500
to carry on the work. The action makes
it almost certain that no interference with
the Hawthorne track will be made by
the Cicero Town Board.

PHEASANTS IN THE VALLEY
These Game Birds Are Doing Well in
the Yosemite.
In the early part of May the Fish and j
Game Commissioners placed in the Yo- I
semite Valley about a dozen pheasants.
It was believed that with the abundance
of cover and water there the birds would
do well, and this belief is likely to be cor- |
rect, judging from the following letter re- i
ceived yesterday by Deputy C. A. Vogel
sang from J. B. Cook, manager of the !
Central Hotel in the valley:
. "None of the pheasants had been seen
for the last two or three weeks up to the
day before yesterday, when a pair were
seen in Kennev's field with fifteen young
ones. If the others have paired off as th's
pair didâ and we expect the same results
from themâ the outlook for the valley to
become stocked with pheasants is most
encouraging. I will let you know if any
of the others are seen from now on to the. !
end of the season, and how this brood i
, gets along.'' â¢ I

drove them crazy and pandemonium
reigned until the worst cases were in
solitary confinement. The boys suffered
horribly from "swelled head" the next
day. and to add to their misery" each of
them got five days on bread and water.
Many of the boys made up their minds
to run away at Honolulu, but all their
plans went wrong. Captain Book "smelled
a rat." and in consequence only about
i twenty of the special and first class boys
Were given shore leave. All the others
â  had to enjoy the beauties of Honolulu
, from the deck of the training ship. At
Hilo they had a good time. All the lads
were taken ashore and entertained. At
Victoria, B. Â«'.. only a short stop was
made, as Lieutenant Dunbar was taken
sick and had to be sent to the hospital.
I As soon as he was put ashore the Adams
sailed for San Francisco.
The transport Indiana sailed last night
< for Manila with 800 recruits. Sixteen of
her Filipino crew succeeded in getting
ashore here, but all the others will be !
' taken back to Manila. There was very
little excitement around the transport
' during the day. Nearly all the soldiers
are from distant parts of the country and
there were few who seemed to take any
interest in them. ':.- -- .- â¢â -.-

days from [qulque. The latter vessel has
1 been anxiously looked for during the past
two weeks. She is loaded with niter and

of that article that it has been importing

Aristomene was docked the moment she
was passed by the quarantine officer and

The Flottbek had barely come to an
anchor before the boarding masters and
their runners were aboard seeking to get

BATTLE CREEK POLICE
KNOCK OUT LAVIGNE
Has Joined the Army and Wanted
to Do Up the Force of the
Town.
BATTLE CREEK, Mich., Aug. I.â
George, better known as "Kid" La
vigne, disappeared from public sight
shortly after his defeat by Erne at
Buffalo for the lightweight champion
ship and remained quiescent until this
morning early, when he broke out in
this city and attempted to clean out
the police department. He was one of
the .twelve recruits bound from Sagi
naw for Fort Sheridan to join Colonel
Gardner's Thirtieth" volunteer regiment
for Manila. 7 â¢ c . 7
When the station was reached a num
ber of recruits got off and among them
was 'Kid Lavigne. He found a police
man standing on the station platform
and said he longed to lick the whole
police force of Battle Creek.
He and Policeman Gore mixed up
lively for awhile and Gore finally
floored him with a smash in the eye.
He chased Gore with a revolver until
Policeman Bancroft came to Gore's
rescue. Bancroft knocked Lavigne
down with a club and the two officers
hammered him good and plenty. They
could not arrest him as he was in the
United States service and bound for
the front. The "Kid" was badly bat
tered up when the sergeant in charge
of the party finally got him aboard the
train. 75.77

WHEELMAN HANSEN'S
MARVELOUS STAMINA
Man Who Is Racing for the Thou-
sand-Mile .Record Shows No
Sign of Fatigue.
MINNEAPOLIS, Aug. 1.â "Old Man"
Hansen is still grinding out the centu
ries. Six hundred and twenty miles in 55
hours and M minutes was the story up to
1:30 p. m. to-day. "Within the world's
record, the six hundredth mile was fin
ished in a sprint in 2:38, and Hansen was
still feeling fresh. As he sailed down
the incline this side of the railroad
bridge at Lake Calhoun, pushing his
pacemakers, Rooke and Palmer, spring
ing lightly from bis wheel and walking
briskly into the training tent, he looked
the least weary of the. three riders.
Tony Johnson. Hansen's trainer, had
slept but an hour and a half up to 1:38
o'clock to-day. He is up at all hours
read} for an emergency, as he is counting
on bringing in his man several hours be
low the hundred-hour mark. Hansen
still has no haggard appearance, and
complains not even of being tired.
The finish on Monday was at 8:40 p. m.
Then came a sleep of 7 hours and 37
minutes, and at 4:22 o'clock this morning
Hansen resumed the grind. The last
twenty miles of the 600 miles was fin
ished "in 1 hour 7 minutes, as 21 minutes
was consumed in lunching.
Hansen completed 700 miles at 8:10
o'clock this evening. He will undoubtedly
finish by midnight on Wednesday fifteen
hours ahead of the record.
It's always difficult for a young man
to understand why .-any other young
man should fall in love with his sister.

THE EMERGENCY HOSPITALS.
THE Board of Health has certain powers and a
latitude of discretion. When it is using these
powers and this discretion it should be care
ful to have reason on its side. In a contro
versy with the Supervisors over an appropriation
for its work, the board has sought to furnish
an object lesson by closing all of the emer
gency hospitals. There is no evidence of any
necessity for this act These hospitals are very nec
essary in a large city. They are humane institutions
for the temporary reception and emergency treat
ment of the victims of accident. One of them is lo
cated in Golden Gate Park, where driving and road
accidents are of frequent occurrence, and as it is re
mote from medical help and surgical assistance, is a
necessity to the Park administration. Another is on
the water front, where mishaps attend upon the load
ing .nd unloading of ships and life is frequently saved
by the timely ligaturing of a torn artery and suffering
is prevented by prompt treatment of injuries. An
other is in the City 'Hall. Because there was criti
cism of the appointment by the Board of Health of
rounders to places that should be filled by gentlemen
fit for their duties, the board, in pique, and willfully,
has closed these hospitals. At the City Hall this act
was attended by a shameful display of brutality in the
refusal to treat a soldier who had his hand and wrist
painfully lacerated by glass and was in immediate
danger of bleeding to death by the puncture of the
radial artery. A few minutes before the ambulance
brought him to the hospital it had been declared
closed on account of unsanitary conditions, and the
physician present refused to help the wounded man.
It ought not to be necessary to say to the Board of
Health that this is going too far, even if it had a legi
timate reason for closing these hospitals. If a doctor
found a man bleeding to death on the street he should
be kicked out of his profession for refusing to render
him assistance. But how much more grievous is the
offense of one who is salaried by the taxpayers re
fusing help to a patient whom he is required to assist
in the discharge of his official duty.
Such inhuman conduct will not help the case of the
board, even if it were a good case, and will only add
to the stench of a case already known to be bad.
We warned the members of the Board of Health
not long ago to beware of violating the ethics of their '
profession and their obligations to it as gentlemen
by yielding to the demand of blackguards in the plac
ing of their official patronage. By not heeding that
warning they became the laughing stock of the com
munity and seem determined now to become also the
objects of its detestation.
The California Volunteers gave up good positions,
lost their salaries, left their homes and went to the
Philippines to fight for the republic, and it is a very
mean man who at this time refuses to contribute to
the fund to prepare for them a grand welcome home.
It is said that certain recent political disturbances
seem to indicate that Governor Gage intends to think
for himself. The Governor's friends always did insist
that his administration would be one of surprises.
After closing up the receiving hospitals, if the
Board of Health will now close itself up the people
will be half ready to accept the situation and call it
square.

SAN DOMINGO AFFAIRS.
THE assassination of President Heureaux, after
serving sixteen years in that office, seems to '
have been intended to prevent his election to j
I another term, though it had the pretext of personal
revenge.
As the usual means of effecting changes in the per
sonnel of that country are revolutionary, it is not a
surprise that a revolt has followed and threatens to
:' become general. Immediately there is raised here an ,
1 outcry that our government must intervene to pre- j
i vent a revolution. By what right? We have had three
revolutions in this country- since we became inde- j
pendent, and two of our Presidents have been assas- j
j sinated. Suppose that all Europe had treated any of j
I these events as valid reason for sending allied armies I
; and associated fleets here to take charge of us, what
answer would our people have made to such an in- ,
vasion?
Our last revolution, the civil war, visited wide-
I spread misfortune and famine upon other countries.
j The cotton spinners of Manchester starved while their J
| spindles rusted for lack of the raw cotton to spin.
No revolution, ancient or modern, has visited upon
, the world's commerce such distress and loss. \etwe :
â  treated it, fought and ended it, in our own way, and I
! would have resisted to the last man and last dollar
any interference, though upon the plea of imperiled \
| commercial interests and interrupted trade.
The mongrels of San Domingo have exactly the
| same rights that we had. The right of the discon
\ tented to revolt is not limited numerically. We have :
j had the whisky rebellion, Shay's rebellion and the
j civil war, only three, but we may have others. We ;
\ have had two Presidents murdered, and our average
iin both respects is not much behind that of San :
\ Domingo.
Of course every American observer knows that if '
' the administration permit itself to be nagged into i
' active interference, it will be not through fear of any j
damage to American trade. Our total exports to |
San Domingo for the eleven months ending May, j
1809, were valued at $947,367. If the profit were 20 j
per cent it was less than $200,000, and it would cost j
twenty times that to make interference effective.
The real reason for urging interference is the de
sire to assume more of the white man's burden, to
go abroad seeking more glory and preparing to in- j
crease our present daily war expenditure of $800,000. j
The population is like all tropical people, peppery 1
as their climate and unstable as its storms. White j
men can't live there and the blacks work as little as j
possible and use their abundant leisure in politics. j
Toussaint I'Ouverture made the country, in con- j
nection with Hayti, a republic in 1801. and it became j
a separate republic about sixty years ago. A revolu- .
1 tionary chief offered it to the United States in
I Grant's time, but a Republican Senate had the good
I sense to reject the gift, since when we have done very
j well without San Domingo and San Domingo has .
j done as well without us.
When the island first became free and the black
: slaves became its rulers they at once established an 1
aristocracy. Being more familiar with the nomencla-J
' ture of the kitchen than with Heraldry and the
i Almanach de Gotha. they solemnly invested each
' other with such titles as Duke de Champignon, the
; Count de Bouillon, Baron de Succotash and the
Baronet Boeuf aia Mode. At bottom our American
: imperialists lust for something like that, and we beg ;
' to suggest that they depart and colonize the ague
smitten, mosquito-burdened, sand-crab populated
i plains of San Domingo and grow up with the coun
! try, in the enjoyment of titles acquired by the old '
; aristocracy derived from the menu.
According to the returning heroes of Nebraska,
Aguinaldo is in a particularly embarrassing plight. If j
he refuses to fight he will be shot by his followers.
If he fights he is likely some day to dangle at the end j
iof a rope. He ought to send to The Hague for an j
I arbitrator.
The friends of the "bad" Sheriff of Socorro, who
persists in flourishing his pistols at inopportune times
and in ill-chosen places, -ought to get him out of the
city, as he is likely to leave us with a bad impression
and a broken pate.
TROPICAL CLIMATES.
DISCUSSION is on again concerning the fit
ness of the tropics to sustain an Anglo-Saxon
population and transmit it, physically and
mentally unimpaired, from generation to generation.
The Chronicle devotes a column to this subject,
with the conclusion in these words: "No territory
has been acquired by our Government in the tropics
in which an American, whether from Maine or Flor
ida, may not make his home in safety, and with the
assurance that its warmer sunshine will visit no de
generacy upon his children."
There are no physical nor historical facts to sustain
that conclusion. Certain recent English and Ameri
can writings, semi or pseudo scientific, have attempted
to contradict the experience of ages and the findings
of science in that respect, but they can by no means
be taken as authority to overthrow the world's knowl
edge acquired by experience.
That the death rate of European military' bodies in
tropical Asia has decreased in the last fifty years has
no bearing at all. England, France and Holland,
which have all maintained armies in the tropics in
that time, have by the enforcement of discipline and
a relentless watchfulness in post and camp, and by the
selection of salubrious locations for garrisons," mate
rially decreased the waste of life which was the rule
in their armies fifty years ago.
But when we speak of the effect of tropical climates
j upon the Anglo-Saxon, we mean the average man,
those from Maine and Florida, who without fortunes
: go as home-seekers to the torrid zone, as they went to
! the upper Mississippi Valley. The tropically salu-
I brious locations are not on the levels where such men
! must seek homes, or the lands from which their own
1 labor must get them a living.
The millions of our people, who labor on farms or
j in the industries of the country, cannot in the torrid
zone pick out a location nor be the beneficiaries of the
discipline of a military post. They must go where the
work is, and if they thrive it must be by the same
toil which wins success here. This leaves out of the
possibilities of their situation the devotion of the time
and precaution which the wealthy may devote to
warding off the horrors of a vertical sun, the poisons
of humidity and the relaxing and strength destroying
effects of a climate to which white labor can never
adapt itself. The rich man or the officer who can
wear pajamas and a cork hat, and hammock himself
i to be fanned by a servant, is not a representative of
Anglo-Saxon population. Let the Chronicle or the
pseudo-scientific writers quoted by it point out a sin
gle community in the torrid zone where the labor,
skilled, unskilled and agricultural, is performed by
Anglo-Saxons, and its contention will be proved. It
j is true that the Latin races withstand the 'poison and
I pelting sunbeams of the tropics better than the Anglo-
I Saxons. Yet those races. have never produced in the
torrid zone a pure-blooded laboring population. They
I mongrelize with native races and have left everywhere

Anglo-Saxon mongrel has not even physical strength
and is short-lived, so that our- race has not even a
physical survival in hybrid form.
The pure Spanish, French and Italian blood in the
tropics is not transmitted, with unimpaired quality,
from generation to generation. Statistics of Euro
pean marriages in French Guiana show a survival of
141 children of 816 married Europeans, and every one
of them dwarfed, wrinkled and with physical and men
tal infirmities. This is true everywhere in the tropics
where altitude does not nullify latitude. The same
rule covers the domestic animals of the temperate
zone, which degenerate in the tropics.
It is not wise to tempt Americans from Maine or
Florida to go home seeking under a vertical sun.
William Paterson tempted the lowland Scotch in his
Darien scheme and lured them to death. When the
Acadians were banished after the war of 1762, thirteen
thousand of them perished by the climate in French
Guiana, whither they had gone to seek homes.
The Chronicle has now discovered that the Ha
waiian Islands are nature's chosen refuge for white
labor, though situated in the tropics. But a few years
ago that paper thought otherwise. When the Scandi- J
navians were induced to go there as contract laborers i
on the sugar plantations, the Chronicle said: "The j
same inducements are everywhere held out to the cmi- 1
grant, easy labor in a sunny island, where the wind
never blows rudely, where the sea breaks musically J
on palm-shaded shores; where every prospect pleases j
and only man is vile." The result was told by the j
Chronicle, taking a typical case of a strong young
man of twenty-two: "When he arrived he was set at
work at Hilo, a region where the rain falls nearly
every day. In a few months he was reduced from a .
strong youth of twenty-two, weighing two hundred \
pounds, to a condition of decrepitude that brought his j
weight down to one hundred pounds and his appear- j
ance to that of- a huge mummy." As for the North- j
men, the Chronicle said: "The hot climate enervates '
the hardy Scandinavian, and adds to his discontent j
and restlessness."
Yet that paper now speaks of Hawaii: "With a cli
mate to which the white man readily adapts himself, [
without inconvenience or menace to his health, these
beautiful islands of kindly welcome and perpetual j
spring present no obstacles to an easy and noiseless j
adjustment to our political system."
But if Hawaii were what the Chronicle said it was, j
what is to be said of the Philippines, where the Amer- j
ican from Maine or Florida would have to do his i
plowing under two feet of water with a mud buffalo, j
under a vertical sun that poisons every breath he J
draws and every drop he drinks?
Several Stanford students have been held as spies by
the authorities of Brazil. Some of these days the
suspicious inpudence of certain South American re
publics will be rewarded by a visitation of blood and
death which will herald the fact that the United States
is still on the map.

The California Code Commissioners, after months
of laborious effort, have arrived at the conclusion that
the Penal Code is a book of errors. They could have

Q CCORDING to reports given in British papers
ACCORDING to reports given British papers
of the results of experiments made with dum
* * dum bullets and other missiles of the kind, the
' controversy over their use in civilized warfare is pre
! mature. The tests have proven that such bullets of
the kind as have been submitted to the British Gov
j ernment at any rate are unavailable for use by reason
of danger to the users.
The object aimed at by the inventors is the con
struction of a bullet sufficiently small to be used in
i rapid-firing rifles, but of sufficient destructiveness to
render an enemy struck by one of them incapable of
further fighting.
The bullet used by the Springfield rifle of the pat
tern of 1873 was about half an inch in diameter and
; weighed 500 grains. When that bullet struck a bone
! the bone was shattered, and a man struck in any vital
part by it was too seriously wounded, if not killed out
: right, to do any further fighting for the rest of the
' campaign. To gain an increase of velocity and carry
; ing force and to enable the soldier to carry with him
a larger number of bullets, the missiles of recently
' devised rifles have been reduced in size until now that
of the Krag-Jorgensen rifle of 1893 has a caliber of but
.30 of an inch and weighs but 156 grains. It is
claimed that this bullet, while effective enough against
civilized men of a highly strung nervous organization,
is of little avail against savages.
To make the small missile as deadly as the big one
[ used to be, the dumdum and other bullets of the kind
were invented. They are small, but have at the end
of them a portion of lead which is uncased. The lead
' spreads when it strikes the body, and as a conse
: quence makes a big wound; and if it strikes a bone
I shatters it. It is therefore an expansive, but not an
I explosive, bullet, and according to its advocates is no
i more barbarous than the bullets used during the
American Civil War and throughout the world at that
period.
The opponents of the dumdum assert, however, that
tests prove the bullet to be worse than its inventors
designed it to be, and the recent experiments in Great
Britain appear to fully justify the assertion. The ex
periments were made first with a cartridge known to
the British War Office as "Mark IV." It was found
jto be utterly valueless. According to the Manchester
: Guardian, it splintered in the rifle and clogged the
' bore. The primers sometimes exploded backward.
It is conceded the dumdum is an improvement on
the ''Mark IV" cartridge, but even that is not wholly
satisfactory. Speaking of experiments made with it,
the Guardian says:
"Experiments were made with an ox, which proved
i that the bullet with its soft rounded tip invariably ex
pands during its passage through a body. It leaves
behind it bits of lead and fragments of its envelope,
and the 'hole of exit' measures from an inch to an inch
and a half in diameter with jagged edges. Muscles
; and tissues are torn and displaced, and the bones ex
' tensively splintered. For this precious missile we
have sacrificed our good name at home and abroad,
and it is humiliating to reflect that if in its improved
form it be abandoned now it will not be because it is
\an inhuman but because it is a dangerous bullet. The
lead that expands in a wound will also expand in a
riflef. .barrel and leave there some of the splinters which
Were intended for the enemy."
On such a showing it is clear the Mark IV will not
be favored by the firing line of any army. Improve
ments may make it safe after a time, but until such
improvements have been made the controversy over
the dumdum and the Mark IV will remain a purely
: academic discussion.
The easiest way to end Canada's grievance over the
: lack of an ocean port to the Klondike country would
jbe to take the Klondike from her, for then she
j wouldn't need a port.

ADA REHAN WILL STAR
With
Daly's Choicest Plays.
DALY'S Theater has passed into
the possession of Augustln Daly's
greatest rival, Charles Frohman.
The purchase includes the theater
on Broadway, its furnishings and
its general theatrical equipment.
It does not include the pictures, statuary
and other works of art which adorn the
lobbies, the green room and Mr. Daly's of
fice.
To Miss Ada Rehan at the same time
were sold the scenery, properties and
wardrobes of the six Shapespearian pro
ductions and three comedies. These com
prise the entire equipment of "Twelfth
Night," "Much Ado About Nothing.
"Taming of the Shrew." "As You Like
It," "A Midsummer Night's Dream and
"Henry IV." The last named was never
produced, but its costumes, armor and
jewels, for which it is said Mr. Daly paid
$20,000. are packed away at the theater.
Miss Rehan's choice of the comedies will
undoubtedly be "School for Scandal.' "A
Country Girl" and an unnamed and un
produced comedy by A. W. Plnero.
From these two sales the executors of
Mr. Daly's estate realized about 1100,000.
Under the will Miss Ada Rehan will get
20 per cent.
Under Daniel Frohman's management
Daly's will continue to be a producing
theater, conducted in the Interest of dra
matic art in its highest phases.
Miss Ada Rehan will now become an
independent star, acting at the head of
her own company in the plays in which
she won most of her fame.
The modern and recent dramatic ana
musical productions made by Mr. Daly
have been turned over to J. C. Duff, Mrs.
Daly's brother-in-law, to be disposed of.
It is generally conceded that Klaw & Er
langer will become the owners of them,
either for the firm or the theatrical syn
dicate, within a few days. The list in
cludes "The Great Ruby," "The Runa
way Girl, "The Circus Girl.' 'The
Geisha" and "The Greek Slave." It Is
known that Edwin Knowles has made a
bid for "The Great Ruby,* but it is not
likely that he will secure It. - â¢
The remainder of Mr. Daly's estateâ
plays, â¢ copyrights, contracts, prompt
books and rights to playsâ will be re
tained by Mrs. Daly.
Two members of the Daly company
have said that they will not continue
in it. It is certain that Charles Froh
man will have his choice of the members,
and that this choice will include Mrs. Gil-
Mr. Frohman said ln speaking of the
change: . .
"The negotiations were opened ana
closed in an hour. My new purchase will
not change mv present plans and book
ings. Daniel Frohman will manage the
theater to suit himself. John Drew, will
not appear on Daly's stage."
* PRESS COMMENTS â¢
AN UNHAPPY PROSPECT.
In the sudden complication in Cuba aris
ing from the question of the surrender of
arms borne by the native troops who
fought for the independence of the island
there is a grave menace of conflict with
the United States Government unless a
firm wisdom prevails in the management
of the delicate problem.
Should a clash of arms result from this
deplorable condition the people of the
United States, while supporting measures
necessary to American control of the
island, will bitterly regret the short
sighted statesmanship responsible for
such a lamentable development. They
realize that the war in the Philippines
could have been averted by wise and con
siderate action on the part of the ad
ministration. They will contemplate with
sadness the necessity for a further sacri
fice of American lives in Cuba caused by
the same bungling methods which pre
cipitated war in the Far East.â Louis

Hearst as a Politician.
Riverside Press.
Some interesting symptoms of Demo
cratic harmony are developing in San
Francisco. Little "Willie Hearst, proprie
tor of that freak newspaper, the Exam
iner is anxious to fill his father's shoes
as Senator from California. He has in
curred the hostility of the "blind boss,
Buckley, who opens up on him as follows
in an interview in The Call:
"The present proprietor of the Exam
iner came to me in the State Convention
of IS9O and wanted me to defeat the aspi
rations of Hon. Stephen M. White, who
was seeking the indorsement of that con
vention for United States Senator. This I
refused to do. He afterward, through an
agent, wanted me to secure for him a
franchise for the Electric Improvement
Company from the Board of Supervisors.
His agent offered to sell me 3000 shares of.
Electric Improvement Company stock at
?2 a share, stating that when the franchise
was granted it would be worth $75 a
shanÂ». I leave it to the public what I
was to do with this stock. I informed his
agent that if he wanted to do business of
that kind he would have to do It himself,
as I was not engaged in it."
This is just a preliminary note or two
to show the range of Buckley's orchestra
tion, so- to sneak. If Hearst really gets
Into the fight the blind boss promises a
full chorus of music that will be extremely
pleasingâ to the Republicans.

The incident of the wound in the arm 'â 
is connected with the first attempt of Mr. '
Reynolds on the stage, and is as follows: i i
While in the African bush the officers were j
wont to divert themselves with private
theatricals when things grew dull. One
evening a play was to be presented called
"The Area Bells," and Reynolds and an
other young officer, named Ivatt.were cast
for the part of women because of their
youth. A stage had been rigged up in the
jungle and the costumes were provided by
the regimental tailor. â :;â¢â ;
The entertainment was progressing sat
isfactorily when it was interrupted by the
sound of heavy firing. The pickets came
hurrying in. firing as they retreated.
Boots and saddles were sounded, and the
"young ladies" of the piece had to mount
costumed as they were and go into a
charge wherein they lost eight officers
and ninety men out of a total number of
about 350 engaged. Reynolds came out of
the fight with his sword arm shattered
arid useless. The body of his companion,
ivatt, was found in the brush next day.'
It was literally hacked to pieces. The
character of a dashing soldier Is not en
tirely a new one to Mr. Reynolds.

MAY DETERMINE THE
ALASKAN BOUNDARY
MONUMENTS BELIEVED TO CON
TAIN POSITIVE BECOBDS.
John Zachert, a Mining Expert, Offers
Information That May Prove of
International Importance.
John Zachert. a mining expert, residing
at CSS Grove street, claims to possess in
formation which he believes . 11! have an
Important bearing on the Alaskan bound
ary dispute. Zachert declares that the
old Russian boundary is defined by monu
ments placed at short Intervals, and that
Inclosed In each Is a chart o^tbe^Busslan
possessions. He is of the belief that the
duplicates of the charts are on file at St.
Petersburg. Zachert says that an â¢*?**"
dition would have little trouble in finding
and following up this boundary line of
monuments, and that the charts would
prove of inestimable value in settling the
dispute â¢ween this country and Canada.
"Seventeen years ago, whiie prospecting
ln the southern part of Alaska." said Mr.
Zachert yesterday, "I happened to camp
in an unfrequented place -where, .to my
astonishment. I found a worn-out Russian
inscription carved on a rock. Being fa
miliar with the Russian language, I
learned from the inscription that in 1533
a Russian topographical expedition had
camped there. A few hundred feet from
that rock the Indians indicated to me a
monument and told me that the Russians
built it. Thinking that some valuable
documents were buried under it, I was
- about to dig them out,, but the Indians
1 prevented this. They thought that the
monument might cover a grave, and
I their superstition would not permit them
to delve into a man's last resting place.
"After that I came back to Sitka, inves
j tigated among the Kusslan3 the value of
f mv discover--, and found that the spot at
i which I had stopped was on the line of
i demarcation of the Russian possessions,
i and that the monument marked the place
' where documents defining that demarca
â â  tion were buried. I tried to Indue - Gov
'. ernor Morris, the collector of the Alaskan
customs, to investigate; but in those days
. it was not worth the trouble to bother
i about the Alaskan boundary. No action
. was ever taken.
"I believe that if an expedition were
i sent to the north it could without great
trouble find this line of demarcation. The
point at which I made my discovery was
. about thirty miles southwest from Ju
. neau. I have learned through the author
ity of Tichmanoff, who published two vol
umes constituting Government reports on
Alaska, that the Russian Government or
â  dered several copper boxes made to in
close the documents defining the boundary
in accordance with the treaty of 182 and
i that it was the intention "to bury these
boxes at intervals along the boundary,
preserving duplicates to be filed at St. Pe
tersburg. Probably twenty such records
are buried in the southwestern part of
Alaska. The letters found on the rock
i were four or five inches long and chiseled
; out. The monument was four feet high
i and built of slab stones. It was about
': 100 feet from the rock. It is probable there
: are other monuments at Prince of Wales
Island and Fort Wrangel.
"As I understand it. the boundary dis
i pute hinges on a difference of opinion as
j to where the crest of the mountain range
lis located. These records may determine
I where the Russians considered the crest
> of the mountains to lie."

CALIFORNIA'S FIRST
GRAND RECEPTION
ROMAN CANDLES AND RED FIRE
FOR NIGHT PARADE.
Proposition as to the Juveniles Who
Will Be in Line â Committees of
the Relatives' Association.
At the headquarters of the Native Sons'
and Daughters' reception committee in
the California Hotel there was received
a letter yesterday from Captain C. R. Al
berg. commanding the military division
of the Columbia Park Boys' Club, offer
ing 'o parade the club with drum corps
and also offering to take charge of all
youths' organizations that may take posi
tion in line. His adjutant, Sidney Piex
otto of 318 Seventh street, will assist ln
the marshaling of the youngsters if the
captain is given the honor asked for. and
he will be. pleased to have any juvenile
organization communicate with him.
The St. Andrew's Society regretfully an
nounced that as a body it could not take
part the parade, but that the mem
bers individually would do all in their
pc>wer to make the parade a great suc
cess.
The invitation pent to the Grand Par
lor of the Native Daughters has been
forwarded to Grand President Cora B.
Sifford for action.
Those who are attending to the pro
posed night parade expect to have an old
time torchlight procession, with a grand
display of Roman candles and red, white
ana blue fire.
If the 3] Ip having the returning volun
teers on board should arrive in the night,
lt is proposed to burn signals agreed upon
on Russian Hill. Clay Street Hill, Tele
graph Hill, the Twin Peaks and at some
jie.int on Bernal Heights.
The minstrel show to-night in aid of
the reception fund promises to be a suc
cess, both from an artistic point and from
a financial one. The programme will be
one of the best that has ever been pre
sented in Native Sons" Hall by either
professionals or amateurs.
The following fiamed have been ap
pointed committees of the Parents' and
Relatives' Association that will be. given
the first opportunity to greet the return-

companies, requesting that free trans
portation be given to the members of the
Fifth Regiment from that free trans
ition be given to the member-- of the
i Regiment from all points within
reasonable distance to and from San
Frnnclsco. The motion received the unan
imous sanction of the committee, and Sec
retary McPlke was so instructed.
The sum of $1:7 was appropriated for
the purchase of six flags to be
hoisted on Telegraph Hill, which is re
garded as .i most conspicuous position.
Manager William Leahy stated that all
the eaters will give benefits for 'the re
ception and that the sum of $6000 will be
realized therefrom. â 'â  ,
W. J. Martin called the attention of the
committee to the fact that the Orpheum
management had given free entertainment
to the returned volunteers who were In
imp, but that no provision had been
mode for the members of the Pennsylva
nia regiment who arrived last evening, or
for any other of the home-coming volun
teers, and suggested that it would be too
great an imposition upon the theatrical
managements to ask them to entertain
free of charge the thousands who would
arrive here in the near future. He also
felt that it would be showing too much
partiality if the rest of the boys were not
entertained fully as well as those who had
come in early: and on his motion Mr.
Leahy was instructed to get a special rate
from the different theaters for the enter
tainment of the returning volunteers.
It. Fahey was substituted for George
Rodgers, who is out of town, as the rep
resentative of the Woodmen of the World

The work of getting ready for the
primary election on August 8 Is going
forward in each Assembly district.* Re
publicans are making special effort to
get the leading citizens of the party
interested in the campaign to the ex
tent of serving as delegates in the
municipal nominating convention.
The organized and active efforts of
the City Republican League have add
ed largely to the enrolled Republican
strength, and induced many Republi
can voters of the "stay-at-home" per
suasion to give a little time to the con
sideration of municipal politics. The
leaders of the league say that their
organization is perfect in every district,
but they do not readily find men of the
right type who are willing to be put on
the ticket for delegates. For one rea
son or another prominent business
men who are willing to contribute
money to the cause ask to be excused
from service in* the nominating con
vention. Pressing business demands
and lack of time are generally submit
ted as the reasons for declining con
vention honors and responsibilities.
The officers of clubs organized under
the auspices of the Republican County
Committee are strenuously endeavoring
to bring out the best class of men
to be placed on the delegate tickets.
They also find that leading taxpayers
and merchants put up excuses and
figure that they cannot give the time
required to serve the people in the con
vention. There is no trouble in finding
men who are ready and willing to go
to the convention, but the chief diffi
culty is to find men willing who will
give character and prestige to the nom
inating body.
There does not appear to be any par
ticular pressure on the Democratic
party to bring forward representative
men as delegates. The main point in
each Assembly district is to make up
a ticket that will command the support
of "the push." So far comparatively
few Democrats of prominence and in
fluence have been named. Rounders
and job-chasers who have a popular
acquaintance at saloons ana know
everybody "along the line" are in de
mand for service in the convention.
Leaders of various factions dare not
turn down the popular fellows for fear
of losing the fight in hotly contested
districts. -
The Rainey-Examiner League is
making a bold ! effort to capture the
Democratic convention. The sugges
tion emanating from the league that
Jeremiah F. Sullivan should be ap
pointed to arbitrate disputes in the
several districts was at first accepted
by the leaders of the Democratic exec
utive committee of the Committee* of
One Hundred as an evidence that
Rainey had weakened and thrown up
his hands.
Reflection and investigation have
convinced the followers of Jasper Mc-
Donald and Gavin McNab that the
Rainey-Examiner League is playing a
foxy game in order to win a few dele
gates by arbitration. It is quite well
known that arbitration will not be in
voked in districts where the forces
rallying around the Fire Department
are strong enough to ride roughshod
over the opposition. The programme
of the league is to elect as many dele
gates as possible, then claim all the
doubtful, and finally, through the Ex
aminer, force the weak and wavering of
the elect into the Rainey camp.
The notion that Mayor Phelan is In
some way tied up to the Examiner is
all that restrains many of the Demo
cratic clubs attached to the Committee
of One Hundred from coming out open
ly and repudiating the paper. Jasper
McDonald and Gavin McNab have
been obliged to employ fine persuasion
and tactics of conciliation to prevent
clubs from adopting resolutions con
demning the course of the Rainey or
gan.
The Republicans throughout the
city are giving Crimmins and Kelly,
the so-called Republican bosses, a cold
shoulder. The boss influence in the
party is so light that one bartender can
do all the work at Phil Crimmins* sa
loon. The Mexican boss has not shown
his hand openly in this municipal con
test. The heelers and touts, who clus
tered around his headquarters in Sac
ramento last winter, are scattered.
The most of them may be found doing
Democratic politics with either Boss
Buckley or Boss Rainey.
At a meeting of the regular Repub
lican clubs held in the various Assem
bly districts of San Francisco last Fri
day night flve delegates were elected
from each club to constitute an ad
visory board for the government of the
Republican party of this city. The
ninety members chosen by the eighteen
organizations will meet to-night in
Western Hall, Shiels building. 32 O'Far
rell street, for the purpose of effecting
permanent organization.
The duty devolving on the advisory
board is to bring about a degree of
harmony in the various Assembly dis
tricts, so that but one ticket is present
ed to the voters at the primary elec
tion on Tuesday next. Until the com
mittee meets to-night and considers the
various disputes now pending in the
different Assembly districts, no ticket
can be presented. In fact the Repub
lican County Committee is patiently
waiting the report of the advisory
board, as it expects through the lat
ter agency to bring about harmony in
the party and the smoothing over of
factional differences.
According to a prominent member of
the county committee the plan to be
carried out at to-night's meeting will
be to choose a prominent member from
each Assembly district, and the eigh
teen so chosen will act in the capacity
of an arbitration committee. It is ex
pected that through this course all dif
ferences may be appeased and but one
ticket will be presented for the suf
frages of the Republican voters on the
Bth of August.
The members of the Central Republi
can Club were in session until long af
ter midnight last night trying to set
tle the differences in the Thirty-sev
enth Assembly District. For two hours
the vexing problem was discussed be
hind closed doors, and during that pe
riod a representation from the district
in controversy was invited in and
through its spokesman stated Its case.
The differences were at last diplomati
cally settled and the members retired
to their homes for much-needed rest.
Z. "U. Dodge stated that but two clubs
were to be heard from and in all prob
ability they will submit the names of
their delegates to-day and the club will
be in a position on Tuesday to give
a complete list of the delegates to be
voted for in the various districts in the
primary election.
At meetings of Republican clubs of each
Assembly district of this city, held last
Friday, live delegates were elected by
each club to constitute a central organi
zation for the government of the party of
this city. The delegates so elected will
meet to-nglht in Western Hall, Shlels
building, a O'Farrell street, for the pur
pose of effecting a permanent organiza
tion.
THE REPUBLICANS.
Office Holders Barredâ Unit
Rule Recommended.
The regular Republican Club of th*
Thirty-sixth Assembly District last r.ight
adopted a resolution pledging the dele
gates of the club to a unit rule in the
convention. The club adjourned to meet
this evening and select delegates to be
voted for at the primary election.
At a meeting of the executive commit
tee of the Thirty-eighth District Repub
lican Club, held at the Republican Wig
wam, 1032 Golden Gate avenue, last even
ing, the following resolution was unani
mously adopted:
"Resolved, Thai no person holding a
Federal. St.rt-> or municipal position, or
connected in any way with the Re
publican organization, either as a State
Central or County committeeman, shall
be eligible as a delegate to the forthcom
ing municipal convention."
The committee, consisting of one repre
sentative from each of the eighteen pre
cincts of the district, organized by elect
ing S. Schwartz chairman and C, M.
Hackmeier secretary, and decided that as
the district was entitled to twenty-two
delegates they would recommend to i!.Â»
club as delegates a representative citizen
from each precinct and four at large.
A committee, consisting of W. A. S.
Nicholson. Julius Colmann, C. C. Mc-
Carthy, R. \V. Roberts. J. R. Morrison
and Ira B. Dalziel, was appointed by tha
chairman to canvass the district for the
best men to select as delegates at large,
and each individual committeeman was
instructed to canvass his precinct and
present the names at the next meeting of
the committee.
The Prohibition Party.
The Prohibition party has entered the
j political field for the campaign. At Trin
! ity Methodist Church last night Rev. J.
| V,'. Webb or' Fresno discoursed to a fair
j audience on the issues of the campaign
! and the duties of the believers in temper
j ance.
A QUEER VERDICT.
It Will, However, Be Pleasing to the
Relatives of the Dead Man.
Coroner Hill held aVi inquest yesterday
morning upon the body of Thomas Lapsley
and, guided by the report of Autopsy Sur
j geon Zabala, the jury returned a verdict
that the death of Lapsley was due to nat
ural causes. The contents of the stomach
were not analyzed, as Is customary in
crises of suspected poisoning, and there
was nothing else for the jury to do than
to return the verdict of natural causes,
which ls pleasing to the relatives .of the
dead.
The facts of the case were that an hour
or so before Lapsley was seen last lie
told the daughter of Mrs. Kennedy, his
landlady, that he was going to kill him
! self. He also left a note indicating that
i such was his purpose. When the Coro
| ner's deputies arrived to take charge of
the body the poison had disappeared.
Dr. Zabala reported that congestion of
j the kidneys, arising from the abuse of in
toxicating liquors, was the cause of death.

NEW YORK DRIED FRUIT MARKET,
Mail advices from New York say of dried
fruit:
"It ii said that future peaches on the coast
have advanced to 6'ic as the inside quotation
en August shipment, and that a further ad
vance is expected when trading begins The
Indications for a large output of dried peaches
v not so promising as they were. Canners
are offering prices for green fruit which it is
practically Impossible for driers to pay un.ier
the present probabilities for rices. It seems
to be quite likely that prices, will at east re
main firm where they are now. with possibly
an increase if demand continues as strong as
Indications warrant.
"Prunes are steady. Spot supplies are moving
cut gradually under ordinary consumptive de
mand and holders expect that the supply will
b= practically exhausted when new crop goods
come on the market. There are rumors of
further sales of futures, but if they are true
the particulars are kept from the public. It
Is certain that there â ^: bids for new goods,
but so far as know*.. - .ne of the orders have
been confirmed. The general conditions favor
steady prices and the trade anticipates con
siderable activity before ember.
"Apricots are advancing, "ami it is under
stood that no sales are being made on the
coast at less than P'-c, while 10c, â â¢!â¢ even more.
Is asked for the best qualities. The West and
Middle West have bought heavily of new crop
goods, and some buyers for this market say
that it Is difficult to secure the supplies they
want, and It pruliably is at the prices they are
willing to pay. An advance is probable as de
mand increases, as it has already begun to do.
"Raisins are steady. though buyers from
other Eastern markets are reported taking con-
Fidcrable supplies here, enough, according to
the best information obtainable, to lean up
the ungraded anel the two-crown. There are
S5" to AW cars left on the cast, principally
four and three crown. The new crop promises
sn abundant yield of good quality and prices
are expected to rule high this season."

NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, Aug. I.â To-day's stock mar
ket began strong, but the bullish sentiment
became exhauste.l and the .-lose was lower
than last night's. The, declines extended to a
point each in Burlington and Pennsylvania,
and From 1 to 2 points in the leading Indus
trials. Soon after the opening realizing sales
were made on a large scale, operators taking ;
advantage of heavy commission house demand
to take the profits made on the recent rise.
Th* outside buying and the realizing seemed
about equally balanced for a time, but the ',
weiglit of the selling prejved too much for '
the market to carry and prices of railroads i
gave way. Ttie softness Of the market moved
the professional operators to turn to the short
side alter having realized, and they attacked
values vigorously in the afternoon, wining out ;
practically all the gains in th" specialties and
carried the railroads generally a sharp frac
tlon below last night. There were some iso
lated sticks which maintained their strength
throughout the day, .My the Chicago Great
Western issues, Colorado and Southern and

a fraction to 3%. The strong June statements
by Atchison and Union Pacific were without j
marked effect.
Rates tor call money to-day were marked
up te-> 4% rier cent In the afternoon. Cheap i
money does not apr>ear nearer tan it. did a I
month ago. as London and the Continent are
evidently counting on borrowing the credits
to be established by the coming export move
men The calling home ot these -edits would,
it seems probable; result in sales of securities
rather than shipnj*pts of gold, which the Bank
of England is still buying in tlie pen market
and from Germany. London bought quite free

bills against future grain shipments continued

fall in exchange on Paris this week, and to
day sterling exchange on Paris rose 1% cen

lenders on New York and have drawn on their
deposits in New York banks for the pur

CHICAGO WHEAT MARKET.
CHICAGO, Aug. I.â Pronounced dullness
was practically the only feature of Wheat
j from the opening until within three-quarters
â¢of an hour of the close. During that time the
range of prices was but 'â *â¢â . nnd for long
periods the pit was hah* deserted, traders go
ing to Provisions and Corn, where more ac
tivity was apparent. The opening was rather
weak at a slight decline, September starting
%c lower at 6&>aS6J%c_, It advanced : shortly
â 'â¢ â  -
THE SAN FRANCISCO CA.LT,, WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 2, 1899.
after the opening to 69% c. but soon fell back
tie opening prices and -until afternoon kept
within that range. Little long liquidation was
noticeable during the morning, and although
news as a rule was bearish the absence of
selling pressure -prevented any material de
cline. Cables were lower, but did not show
the decline expected. Reports of the spring
Wheat country indicated a large crop and the
weather was favorable for the grain. North
west receipts were light. Bradstreet's report I
on the visible supply, due about, noon, had a i
tendency to restrict trading in the morning
and a "bearish report was apprehended. The .
surmise proved to be correct, the decrease be
ing put at only 350.000 against 5,714.000 bushels
a year ago. About 12:30 the almost complete
absence of cash demand both here and at out
side points apparently impressed the bulls
with the futility of longer holding their W heat,
and a liquidating movement was started which
grew decidedly heavy as the session drew to
a close. The weakness shown by Corn acted
as a spur to the disgusted longs, and large
quantities* of long Wheat came out on the ,
decline. Previous to the noon hour the hep
tember price hail touched 69 "i-SuOc.. on a mod
erate amount of buying, principally by shorts,
but It declined rapidly under the liquidation
and shortly before Hie close touched 6jc. The
close was weak at 69Vf,c sellers.
Corn was weak and at times quite active. ,
Reports from the corn belt indicated a large
crop. This and continued favorable weather â 
and large receipts started important outside
liquidation. Local longs joined the selling .
movement later and prices declined steadily.
September closed -â¢'"v lower. ]
Oats were dull, but steady In spite of th.->
weakness of other grains. Ther" was a fair
export demand at the seaboard and enough
buyers of September to keep the price steady
most of the session. September lost %c.
Provisions were Irregular. The market was I
strong early and advanced sharply on the
more favorable reports of the yellow fever
condition in the South. The break in the
grain markets started liquidation under which
nearly all the advance was lost. The close
was barely steady, September Pork and Lard
2'jc higher and Ribs unchanged.

The last monthly report from the Alaska
Treadwell mine is the first under the heavy
addition to the crushing power. There are two
mills in operation, the original one of {40
stamps and the new one of .'l'm stamps, the
latter being run with water power. This, how
ever, can only be done through a portion of
the year. Last month the two mills crushed
54.376 tons of ore of the realizable value of
$92,000. There were 1090 tons sulphurets saved
of the realizable value of $40. 76". making a
total for the month of $132,760. The actual bul
lion shipments for the month was $141. the
largest in a long time, if not the largest ever
reported. The expenses for the month in round
numbers were $37,500. Considering the amount
of ore handled this shows a cost of only 69c
per ton.

Expense of a London Season.
The programme for a social season in
London is exceedingly interesting at first
sight, but when one realizes it must be
repeated by each newcomer and aspirins
millionaire it Is evident that "society"
'soon becomes a drug to the freshest indi
vidual. In the first place, a house must
I be taken at any coat; then a series of
i magnificent dinners laid out, then a series
\ of "at homes." with the most famous
celebrities on the stage, dramatic and
I lyric, to "draw" the fine world: then a
1 similar series of dances must be arranged,
with a splendid $100,000 hall bringing up
; the rear. Besides these actual necessities
.; there must be shooting boxes and salmon
i fishing privileges secured, to which shall
â¢ be invited the choicest of new friends, not
! ii"si' you want their company, but
; because it is the thing to invite them.
'â  Having issued this programme for the
! social magnates the multi-millionaire sit.-,
j back and twirls his thumbs while his sec
| retary pays the bills.â Boston Herald.

fr.r tho railroad amps of Ramish &
Marsh and McCormick on the Ellwood-
Sur' extension. The Southern Pacific has
ordered its sub-contractors to put on all
the men possible and rush the work of
construction. Already Stone & McMurtrie
have opened two large construction camps
on the. Santa Anita rancho, through which
the road will run for a distance of seven
teen miles. The great viaduct over Honda
Creek has been completed and now trains
are running some distance this side of the
viaduct. The stone work at this end of
the gap has been delaying the work of
construction, but a large number of extra
stone masons will soon be put at work
at or near Ellwood. and thus will keep
pace with the work of grading. All the
saloons at the northern end of the line,
which have annoyed the contractors s.i
much, have had their licenses revoked and
all new camps have an anti-saloon clause
in heir contracts.

concealed. Southern Sacramento County

sented In the throne which met and wel
comed the returning hero, who had gone
out a private and returned with chevrons

and the place could not begin to accom
modate the crush. National colors were
everywhere and beautiful floral decora

young man s right arm off and poured
out cheerful words of congratulation.
Th*. soldier boy was the recipient of some
valuable presents.
Among the notables present was on

Island Farmer.
STOCKTON. Aug. I.â Another fir*
broke out to-day on the new reclama

peat is afire and has been burning since

100 acres of grain owned by a farmer
named ,M..ran went up in smoke. This
whs Moran's entire crop. He has been
unfortunate with fires this summer,
this being the third on his place. Own

The general belief Is that most of the
fires on reclaimed lands come from the

The monkey was in a cage and got so ex
cited that he almost tore the cage in
pieces. The owner of the bird store said
he bough! the monkey for $5.
Bebb was notified, and he went to the
bird store yesterday, hut as he was re
i fused possession of his pet he went to
Judge Mogan's court and obtained
a search warrant. "Jim" was crazy
with delight when taken out of the bird
store and his actions at seeing again his
owner were almost human. Bebb says
, .that the whole regiment will he in court
to-day if necessary to testify in "Jim's"
favor.

The members of the Merchants' Assocla

- within the dollar limit. They will submit j
it to the Finance Committee of the Board !
of Supervisors when that body meets with
Mayor Phelan on Thursday night.
Every member of the association has j

By Call representatives it was learned,

i than it asked for; the Health Department

Street Superintendent Fragley, who
asked for an Increase of $400,000, is not |
awarded that figure by any means, but
his appropriation is materially increased,
as is that of Assessor Dodge.
In order to provide for these depart

to scale as closely as possible the Police I
Department fund and the school fund.
It is said that the park fund also came In
for a reduction, although tee what extent
it was Impossible to learn.
What action the Board of Supervisors

listen to the plan which Mayor Phelan
promised to evolve, and the merchants
have decided that thai will be the most
opportune time to bring their levy to the
hoard's notice. Every plan that has been
figured "in will be brought up at the
Thursday meeting, and the board's sub
sequent action will depend upon the fig- j

I WESTERFELD'S INSURANCE. j
The Executors Have Trouble Over
Two Separate Policies.
The Supreme Court has reversed the or
der of the lower court denying a new trial
in the case of Pauline Westerfeld ami
others against tin- New York Life Insur
ance Company. The plaintiffs are the ex
ecutors of the will of William Westerfeld, I
deceased, late of this city. In 1890 he took
out a policy on his li:'.' in the sum of $10,
--...... which -policy Included a provision
that at the expiration of five years from,
'â  its date- the insured might surrender the
policy and receive its then cash value.
Westerfeld paid four annual premiums
and then made an arrangement with the
company whereby the latter executed to I
him ii new policy, dated February ID, 1894,
for the same amount as the former, but
on a different plan, and the promise was I
made to him that the- company would
compute the surrender value in cash of
! the first policy and apply the surplus
! thereof above the fifth premium, to be
come due in the following April, In pay
ment of premiums on the second policy.
W< st. rfeld agreed to give up the first pol
icy as soon as its value- was determined
and due credit given. II- died on Febru
ary 18; ISÂ»S, having in his possession both
policies, not having received any notice i
from the company.
The plaintiffs claim that the company
fused to pay any part of the policy, and
by false and fraudulent representations
Induced them to release and surrender
I both policies for the sum of wow 66. The
1 nraver in their complaint was for judg
ment for $7333 33 and interest from March,
1895 They won in the lower court. Ihe,
defense denied that any false representa
tions had been made, and if the local
agents had made an arrangement for the
surrender value of the first policy in pay
ment of premiums on the second they vio
lated the provisions of the first policy,
which allowed a surrender value to the
same only after it had been In force five
7,. -s. and the agent's acts had never
been ratified. Also, that the plaintiffs,
upon determining that they had been best
ed in the compromise, had never made of
fer to readjust by offering the amount ac
cented The action, according to the high
i er court, should have been for the dam
aces sustained by the alleged fraud. Fpr
: Dermitting these, and other errors by the
. iow.r court, the cause was remanded.

fact of slippery rails, was re
sponsible this morning for al

injuring at least two people.
The Berkeley train was due at the
Oakland mole at 11:25 o'clock, and
shortly after passing "Death Curve" at
West Oakland, which boasts a record
for more accidents than any spot on
earth, crashed into the rear of a water
ing or sprinkling train. The sudden
collision threw passengers on the local
from their seats, piling them up in
heaps, and although, so far as could be
learned, none of these sustained injur
ies of any note, some were scratched
and slightly bruised.
The train crew, however, was not so
fortunate. Brakeman Charles Pa Wiser
was thrown from his seat against the
edge of another seat, sustaining a frac
tured rib. He was promptly conveyed
to his home, 1412 "Walnut street, Berke

At last accounts he was resting easily,
but it is not at all definitely stated
that he did not sustain internal injur

Conductor Christopher Cottrell, who
was In charge of the Berkeley local,
was also thrown violently to the floor
of his car, and was unable to resume
his run. He too was removed to his
home, 1.133 Henry street, Berkeley,
where he is now under the care of his
physician. The extent of his Injury has
not been ascertained as yet.
The collision occurred almost directly
in front of Tower House 2. The water
ing train, made of a locomotive and
three flatcars provided with large iron
cylindrical tft'nks formerly used for the
transportation of oil, had just made a
run to "West Oakland, watering the
roadbed, and was on its journey back
to the mole. It had no sooner taken to
the Berkeley track than the local from
the university town came speeding
along, moleward-bound at a fair rate.
Engineer "Dad" Bryan, who held the
throttle on engine 1286, drawing the
Berkeley local, states that he thought
the watering train was making for the
mole at a good speed, and he was to
tally oblivious of any danger immi
nent. Suddenly he realized that he was
gaining too rapidly on the watering
train, and when his train approached
closer proximity to it he applied the
air "brakes, so he says, but it was too
CULMINATION OF A
KLONDIKE ROMANCE
MISS IDA LUCE WANTED A MAN
WITH A FORTUNE.
Morris Baxter Went to Klondike not
to Return Until He Had a .Sack
of Nuggets for Her.
ALAMEDA. Aug. I.â The final act In a
Klondike romance was performed In Ala
meda last night, when Morris W. Baxter
of Dawson City and Miss Ida Luce of
Wheatland were united in marriage. The
nuptial knot was tied at the home of the
bride's cousin, Fred J. Whiting, 1210 Ver
sailles avenue. Rev. John Hahnon olficiat-
Ing.
Mr. Baxter and his bride met several
years ago at Wheatland, It was a case of
love at first sight on his part, and he
"popped the question" without much de
lay. .Miss Luce took a fancy to Baxter
but told him that he did not have enough
of this world's goods to support a wife.
and she refused to accept him until he
had accumulated sufficient capital to as
sure them a good start in life. She heard
but little of Baxter from that day until
last Friday, when he arrived from the
Klondike on the steamer Humboldt. He
had been fortunate In the northern gold
diggings and returned a capitalist. He
telegraphed Miss Luce that he had won
a fortune and that all he required to com
plete his happiness was her hand in mar
riage. The young lady was true to her
promise, and as soon as she heard from
Baxter she hastened to Alameda, where
the marriage ceremony was performed.
The groom is a cousin of Clarence Berry
of Fresno, one of the original lucky min
ers of the Klondike region. Mr. and Mrs.
Baxter will reside in Wheatland.

SHE PLEADED MERCY
FOR RECREANT LOVER
OAKLAND. Aug. I.â Frank Mott, the
gripman who, after attempting suicide
last week, was surrendered by his bonds
men, appeared in the Police Court to-day
to answer the charge of assault with a
deadly weapon upon Miss Eliza Schom
berg last May, and his trial was continued
until August IS. He was, moreover, re
leased on his own recognizance. Miss
Schomberg. the object of Mott's Infatua
tion and on account of whom he attempt
ed to end his life because she had written
to his wife in Dcs Moines, lowa, telling
about his adventures here, appeared in
court also, but was very relenting. The
sight of her ex-lover appealed to her
compassion, and before many minutes she
urged Prosecutor Leach to have the case
of her recreant lover dismissed. The con
tinuance, coupled with the fact of his
release on his own recognizance, may, it
is believed, prove quite equal to the young
woman's request.
DB. BITTEB TO BETUBN.
The Professor of Zoology at Berkeley
. Bids Adieu to the Harriman
Scientific Expedition.
BERKELEY. Aug. I.â Professor W. E.
Ritter at the department of zoology at the
University of California is expected to ar
rive in Berkeley next Thursday.
Much interest attaches to Professor Rit- <
ter's return, he hieing the University of j
California's representative upon the cele
brated Harriman scientific expedition,
which has been exploring Alaska and the
Aleutian Islands during the months of <
June and July. Dr. Ritter went as an
authority on zoology, and during the trip
has devoted the whole time to arduous
scientific research along the lines of his
own branch of study. He will bring back |
with him many valuable specimens to be i
placed ln the university museum, as well ;
as much new Information about the re- i
gions through which the expedition I
passed.
The party are reported to have reached j
Seattle last Sunday. They were to have j
taken steamer at once for Portland, where j
the majority of them start for the East. â 
Dr. Ritter will leave the party at Port
land, returning home by rail.
Funeral of Dr. J. S. Adams.
OAKLAND, Aug. I.â The funeral of the
late Dr. J. S. Adams, who died suddenly
at Calistoga last Saturday was held 'his
afternoon. Simple exercises, conducted
by Rev. Mr. Burnham of Vallejo at the
late, and the rails were wet and slip
pery from having been sprinkled, and
in the next moment the Berkeley
crashed into the rear of the water
train.
The pilot of engine 1286 was quite
badly damaged, but the engineer and
fireman escaped. The two rear water
ing cars piled one upon the other,
while the passengers in the Berkeley
coaches were panic stricken, and
quickly as possible gathered them-^
selves together and jumped from the
train helter-skelter in their efforts to
escape death.
Conductor McCarthy was in charge
of the watering train, but he had no
explanation to offer further than that
which everybody realizedâ that the
"Berkeley hit his train."
Conductor Cottrell of the passenger
train, on the other hand, says that he
cannot account for the carelessness of
the watering crew in obstructing the
Berkeley track, when they well knew
the local was due at the time.
The wrecking train was immediately
dispatched to the scene of the collision,
and in less than an hour the wreck
was cleared away and the track opened
for traffic.
home, 514 Albion street, were followed by
rites at the Masonic Temple. The attend
ance of friends was very large and the,
floral tributes exceedingly numerous.
Arming the latter the most notable was
a great garland of St. Joseph lilies sent
by the Alameda Medical Association. The
pall-bearers were Drs. Joseph R. Brad
way, A. H. Pratt. D. D. Crowley and W.
F. B. Wakefield of the medical associa
tion and Messrs. J. L. Howard, William
I. Landis. A. L. Johnson and Congress
man Victor Metcalf, friends of deceased.
The interment was at Mountain View
Cemetery.
Free Library Privileges.
OAKLAND. Aug. I.â The privileges of
the Free Public Library have been ex
tended to the residents of Alameda Coun
ty, within the discretion of the librarian
and under the rules and regulations of
the library and upon the payment of $1
per quarter. The Board of Free Li
brary Trustees passed a resolution to that
effect to-night. It was also resolved that
new books of fiction shall hereafter be re
tained by patrons only one week, and
shall not be renewed or taken out by a
member of the same household, the word
"new!' applying to books until one year
from the date of their accession.
Organizing Board of Trade.
OAKLAND, Aug. I.â At the meeting of
merchants at Haywards, called for the
purpose of organizing a Board of Trade,
last night H. E. Bruner acted as chair
man and A. V. Morgan as temporary sec
retary. J. E. Geary. F. F. Allen, D.
Chisholm. P. Wllbert and P. J. Crosby
were appointed a committee on perma
nent organization, and G. H. Oakes. J. W.
McCoy and Dr. B. F. Simmons on con
stitution and by-laws. These committees
will meet again next Monday night,
when it is expected an organization will
be effected.
Ticket Office Bulgarized.
OAKLAND. Aug. -Thieves broke Into
the ticket office at the Fourteenth street
depot at a very early hour this morn
ing by breaking the lock on the door. The
work bore the earmarks of novices and
their labors were not rewarded by any
booty. It is presumed that, since com
muters have been buying their August
commutation tickets the past few days,
the burglars hoped that there would be
at least a snug sum on hand In the money**'
drawer.
George B. Fletcher Complimented.
The Point Lobos Improvement Club met
last night and after adopting a report of
the executive committee, In which Presi
dent George R. Fletcher w*as highly com

ADVERTISEMENTS.
Spanish - American
War Panorama
Is one of the war books which ls likely
to be in continuous demand. It is a
panoramic record of the triumphs of
Yankee Doodle. The eagle flaps his
wings on every page, and "Old Glory"
waves around and above every scene.
Prominent officers connected with the
war are here portrayed, as well as
many of the "men behind the guns."
Military life is pictured to the eye, from
recruiting to guard mount and skirmish
line. Nor is the ludicrous omitted. The
company cook receives the attention
due to his importance; the mess is
shown; cavalry scenes are given; the
hospital arrangements are depicted; the
heroines of the Red Cross service are
displayed; street scenes in Havana,
Santiago and elsewhere are unrolled,
the new citizens or subjects (which are
they?) of Uncle Sam appear and dis-
appear as the leaves are turned.
In a word, the gazer visits the new
localities and sees the tumultuous new
life, without the risk or expense of a
sea voyage. " r r- v " , ,_ .â

PERKINS TALKS
OF HIS TRIP TO
GOLDEN ALASKA
Is Sanguine for Civil
Government.
â Â»
HIGH LICENSE AND RAILROADS
THE SENATOR DISCUSSES CON
TRACT LABOR IN HAWAII.
â¦
He Blames Senator Morgan for the
Existing State of Things,
Which, He Says. Is
Temporary.
United States Senator George C. Per
kins is back from a visit to Alaska. The
Congressional party that accompanied
him to the far north had a most. enjoyable
trip, and it is safe to say that the legis
lators now know* more about Alaska than
they did when Congress adjourned.
The Senator was a busy man while he
was in the north. He addressed the
Chambers of Commerce at Sitka and Ju
neau on "Civil Government for Alaska."
attended a reception given in his honor by
Governor Brady of Alaska, visited Skag
uay and Inspected the railroad over White
Pass and took a keen interest in every
thing that was going on In the country.
At last winter's session of Congress a
civil government bill for Alaska was in
troduced, but failed to pass. A new bill
has been prepared, which will be present- ;
ed at the next session, and Senator Per
kins is sanguine that It will become law. j
"In order to obviate the causes of failure '
in the first bill." said the Senator yester- j
day, "we submitted the draft of the hew
one to the District Attorneys of Alaska
and the Chambers of Commerce at Juneau
and Sitka. They have suggested a num
tier of changes, and when these have been .
incorporated I think the bill will become ;
law. . . !
"High license is working like a charm in
Alaska. Formerly there were eight sa
loons in Sitka and now there are only two.
Of course the people who have paid the
license won't allow the others to violate
the law. and in consequence smuggling is
almost a thing of the past in the lerri-
tory. - . _ ,
"Skaguay is the gateway of the Yukon
and Central Alaska. The railway from
that point over the White Horse Pass to
Eake Bennett la one of the engineering
feats of the age. No more skill was re
quired in the construction of the Denver
and Rio Grande. The road is as substan
tially built as any of the transcontinental
roads. The journey to Dawson can now
be made in seven days and without any
hardships." . '_ Â
Speaking of the Alaska boundary dis
pute the Senator said: "I think the matter
will be amicably settled without arbitra
tion. There Is nothing to arbitrate. It
would be just as reasonable for us to in
sist upon taking up the old boundary
question between the United States and
Canada again and declare our dissatis
faction with the forty-ninth degree of
latitude. England long ago recognized the
boundary for which we are contending.
She Id this when the Hudson Bay Com
pany (which was practically Canada at
that time) executed ,i least for ten years
from Russia of the territory she is now
contending for. This leas* was renewed
for a second term, so what better. proof
could any one ask of our ownership.
These lands which the Hudson Bay Com
pany leased from Russia, and England
now" seeks to lav claim to, we purchased
from Russia. There is nothing to arbi
trate." _ 7 '
I-n regard to the contract labor ques
tion in Hawaii. Senator Perkins said:
"The blame for all that trouble rests with
Senator Morgan of Alabama. He was
sont to Hawaii to frame a code for th-
Government of the islands, and had it
not been for his opposition the laws now
in force in the United States in regard to
contract labor would now be in force in
Hawaii. V -, , __, ,
""Early in the last session of Congress I
introduced a contract labor law for Ha
waii. It was amended in the Senate and
when it was getting near the time for
Congress to adjourn 1 used every effort
in mv power to have it pass. I had the
bill advanced on the file and everybody
was pledged to vote for it. Congressman
Fairbanks agreed to bring it up in the
House and after its passage I had ar
ranged to rush it through the Senate and
on to the President for signature. Im
agine mv surprise and disgust when Mor
gan of Alabama objected to the bill and
it failed to pass. That is why Italians,
Japanese. Portuguese. Chinese and Slavs
are pouring into Hawaii as contract la
borers." .
Senator Perkins is looking very much
better for his vacation and says he en
joyed .every hour of his stay in Alaska
and on the Sound.
TO PRESERVE THE TREES.
Chief Forester Pinchot to Arrive Here
on Friday.
A few weeks ago information was re
ceived frcm Washington that a prominent
member of the forestry branch of the
Department of the Interior would visit J
this coast to look after the interests of
Uncle Sam's timber and forest lands.
Yesterday J. A. Filcher. manager of the
State Board of Trade, received a letter
from Gilford Pinchot, chief forester of the
United States, who is now in Oregon. This
is the gentleman mentioned as the nigh
Official from Washington. Mr. Pinchot :
states that he will arrive in this city on
Friday and will depart for Los Angeles
on Saturday. During his stay here he de
sires to meet as many as possible who are
interested in the forestry question and |
he asked Mr. Filcher to call a meeting of
such men as would be able to enlighten
him on the subject.
Mr. Filcher at once arranged for the
meeting to be held in the rooms of the I
Press Club and he sent invitations to the
following gentlemen to attend and meet j

Jor Failing to Divide His Spoils
With the Chief Grafter He Is
Arrested, but Immedi
ately Released.
The arrest of Edward Campbell, alias
i'Canada Ed," alias George Bell, the j
King of Bunko Men] yesterday, created a j
sensation among the gang of professional ,
"grafters" who were led to elieva that j
he was impregnable on count of his al
leged pull against ing taken Into cus- |
:ody- on the insignificant charge of
swindling a "sucker." Campbell for some
time past has been associated with John
Sweeney; the "Prince of Grafters,' as ha
is familiarly known to the deluded gang
which â¢â¢work" in his alleged profession.
The "King of Bunko Men" arrived here
several months ago from Chicago, and
â¢learning that Sweeney was the head of
the ganc: of unscrupulous grafters that
infest this city, concluded to "see" him
in order that lie might uperate without
police interference. Sweeney had heard
of Campbell'S successful operations m
tlie East and at once welcomed him to
his fold. "Mike" Golden, who has a local ;
-reputation as a successful "top and bot
tom" operator, was then Sweeney's part- <
ner. Campbell showed such an aptitude
"for robbing bucolic strangers that â 
Sweenev included to dissolve partner- j
ship with Golden, after informing blm j
.that the Chicago grafter could "give him j
cards and spades" in enriching the treas
.urv of the gang. Golden at first vigor
ously resisted his deposition as one of
â¢-the ""kings" of the despicable gang, but :
as Sweeney threatened to invoke the aid
of the police in having him driven out of!
'-die city, he finally submitted to the in- â 
evitable nd gracefully resigned his posi
inbell was then installed as confiden- j
tial adviser to his majesty "King" Swee
'>nev and a more successful plan to rob |
"suckers" was quickly formulated at the ;
direction of the Chicago ! grafter. The
.plan worked to perfection and in a short
lime Sweeney found himself richer than
â over. While i intoxicated from the effects
of champagne he would boast of Camp
bell's "wonderful generalship" and his
cleverness in "separating suckers from
.their money," as he expressed it. It is
all different now. however. Sweeney does
not think as much of his confidential
partner, and he is anxious to either drive
him out of the city or have him sent to
prison. The trouble between the two
dates back to bout a -el; ago. Camp
bell, being short of ready cash, picked up
a stray "sucker" and "skinned" him out
of $60 at the time-worn three-card monte
game. He failed to report the "trick" I
to Sweeney, and the mighty "king," on
learning of the duplicity of his confiden
tial partner, arose in his wrath and swore
that he would get even.
Yesterday he visited police headquar- .
ters and caused, a warrant to be is
sued for the arrest of his ex-partner,
charging him with grand larceny. The
warrant was placed in the hands of De- â¢
tectives Egan nd Silvey and through
Sweeney they located Campbell on Kearny |
and Bush streets yesterday moon and !
took him into custody. Learning that a
warrant was out for his arrest, Campbell

"suckers" in Chicago, he was detected in

HEALTH BOARD EXPERIMENTS
WHILE UNFORTUNATES SUFFER
g-.p-3P.TTH Is an indigestible food in
the composite maw of the
Health Department of San
ii Francisco. The Call printed a
story yesterday exposing the
crude subterfuges of the Health Of
ficers in their methods to secure a
greater appropriation for their own
special departmental use.
Yesterday afternoon the secretary of
the hoard. Leon Dennery of much ill
savored notoriety, with a great show
of little and brief authority, freed his
mind of a burden that was burning.
his frontal bone. He refused The Call
any information on Health Depart
ment matters.
To foster an epidemic, to trouble the
popular mmd with disease possibilities,
to force the injured to jog over ill
paved roads when the emergency de
mands immediate medical attention,
seem to be the purposive actions of the
San Francisco Board of Health. That
body might just as well close its jug
gling hop, for as far as its utility is
concerned at present, with all the act

erative, it might as well be non-exist

The closing of the Receiving Hos
pital and the Harbor Hospital has
worked its harm already. Yesterday
morning and afternoon a number of
cases, some serious, others trivial but
attendant with great suffering, went
the long road to the City and County
Hospital. Mothers with their children
came from all parts of the city to re
ceive free vaccination, but disappoint
ment was their only portion. The lop

ors' of food and cattle let another evil
into the city's confinesâ one which may
in the near future demand the atten

Present board sat for weeks hatching
a plot to make the department which
they represent a model of perfect in
efficiency they could not have been
more successful.
There is a law making it compulsory
for school children to be vaccinated^
The city has kept a watchful eye on
this disease preventive, offering to all

A NUDE AND RAVING
SOLDIER RUNS AMUCK
DOES MUCH DAMAGE BEFORE
SUBDUED.
Nathan Herzog, a discharged private of
! Company M. Twenty-second Infantry, be
came madly insane last evening in the,
California Hotel, 210 Montgomery avenue
Before he could be secured he knocked
out two police officers and badly injured
Mrs. La Pierre, who resides at the cor
ner of Montgomery avenue and I'ilbert
street. Special Officer Daggett, who was
first called to take charge of the insane
man suffers from many bruises and Of
ficer' Freel was taken to his home hav
ine been severely cut on the head by
glass Herzog was finally captured, by
Citizens Stewart and Hoyer and taken
to the Receiving Hospital, where he was
treated by Drs. Sherwood and Murphy,
two physicians who volunteered to dress
the insane man's wounds, produced by his
Jump through a glass door.
Herzog rented a room in the hotel early
yesterday morning. About 8 o'clock last
evening the proprietor notified Special Of
ficer Daggett that there -was an insane
man In room 15 of the. house. Upon open
ing the door to the room Daggett discov
ered Herzog perfectly naked and praying.
When he approached the lunatic a. scuffle
ensued, which ended In the escape of the
insane man into the hall. Mrs. I_a Pierre,
who was visiting some friends in an ad
joining room, heard the commotion and
she also .rushed into the hall. There she
was met by Herzog, who struck her a
severe blow over the eye, felling her to
the flocr. The naked man continued his
mad rush down the stairs and came, in
contact with the glass storm doors lead
ing to the street. As be was about to
rush through them Officer Freel attempt
eel to enter. The collision laid the officer
out and Herzog rended the doors from
their hinges as he made his exit.
After reaching the street the condition
of the man attracted many people.' A
chase was begun, which ended In the cap
ture of the soldier by Henry Stewart and
Herman Hoyer. Officer Free] was by this
time reinforced by Detectives McMahon
and Dillon and other officers. When the
patrol wagon was called t*he raving and
bleeding man was driven to the City Hall.
The Insane ward of the Receiving Hospi
tal whs vacant and dark and no physi
cians were in attendance. The man's con
dition was serious and the, cuts about
his head bled profusely. The officers final
ly found Drs. Sherwood and Murphy,
who, by the light of a candle, entered the
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL,, WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 2. 1899.
Emergency Cases That Demand Immediate At
tention Are Carted Off to the City
and County Hospital â A
Day's Work,
terday there was a constant calling
upon the Health Board by mothers
who wished their children to be inoc
ulated with vaccine, but the office was
closed and they were forced to return
home without vaccination. Many call
ers had been vaccinated, and they re
turned to see if the vaccine had taken
effect. To them also was medical as
sistance cut off.
The patrol wagons had a busy day of
it, serving two masters, police and
hospital, the location of which depart
ments are on opposite sides of the
town. Instead of using the hospital
ambulance, the patrol wagon is now
used for all cases.
Hattie Emerson, who was Injured on
Market and Eddy streets, was carried
to the City and County Hospital before
assistance could be given her. Dave
Scully, who was arrested late Monday
night for drunkenness, came- i:;> before
Judge Conlan yesterday morning. He
was suffering trom a head wound, and
could hardly walk. lad the Receiving
Hospital not been closed he would have
been sent there at the time he was
booked. The City and County Hospital
was too far distant, so Scully bled, and
in the morning tottered with un
bandaged head to the tribunal of po
lice Justice. A number of people who
received injuries during the day re
fused to be carted to the other end of
town,' and sought the unripened sur
gical skill of the drug clerk. A man
named Goodrich, 80 years of age, was
run over by a team on Mission street.
As the City and County Hospital was
out of the question he was taken to
his home, where his injuries received
attention.
Not only are human beings suffering
from the ruthless and huckstering ac
tions of the Health Board, but the
poor dumb brims who had the misfor
tune to stumble into that department's
service also feel its inept lash.. At the
Hark Hospital there was but a single
sack of hay for two starving horses.
The attention of Supervisor Aigeltinger
was called to this, and he investigated
for himself. When he reached the
stable in the park the horses were
chewing up the mangers. The Super
visor, with Veterinary Surgeon
O'Rourke, have offered to feed the ani
mals gratis.
The Harbor Hospital was closed yes
terday morning, much to the dismay of
the water front. The doctors, matrons,
internes and ambulance drivers all dis
appeared from the scene as soon as an
place and sewed up the wounds. This
Kindly action was voluntary and heartily
commended by the bystanders.
MISS LIGHTER,
IN THE "LUCIA"
MAD SCENE
WHENEVER a colorature so
prano is at a loss to ascer
tain how to stir her audience
let her appear in the mad
scene of "Lucia," and she
will find that even her most ambitious
expectations will be realized. When one
is, therefore, called upon to review the
performance of "Lucia" as presented at
the Tivoli last evening it becomes neces
sary to allude particularly to the mad
scene. Miss Anna Lichter has proved
herself worthy of the responsible task
allotted to her. Her technical equipment
smacks of thorough training and the ex
position of her role denoted diligent study.
Concisely, carefully and accurately she
emitted the rippling rims and executed the
exhilarating trills that ornament the bril
liant spots Â«f this scene.
It was indeed attentive of Miss Lichter
to include Louis Newbauer as a beneficiary
of the applause, for his flute obbligato
was a masterful piece of work, daintily
executed, and tended to support the vo
calist in her difficult position. Mr. Now
bauer has proved himself a musician of
the first water.
So far as refinement and artistic facility
are concerned; Barron Berthald's voice
may vie with the foremost tenors on
the stage to-day. He phrases tastefully
and sings with judgment. In the higher
register his voice" is excessively mellow
and possesses ringing characteristics. â¢
Resonance, carrying quality and force,
form the main characteristics- of William
Martin's valuable barytone. He has been
raised in a Wagnerian atmosphere, which
is still surrounding him. William .Schus
ter, by his creditable rendition of Ray
mond, the chaplain, demonstrated the fact
how agreeable and necessary a man can
make an apparently inferior part.
Arthur Mesmcr has what may be termed
a milky tenor. He should engage the ser
vices of a chimney-sweep and have his
throat hauled over. The sextet was sim
ply sublimely rendered. To-night "Aida"
will be repeated.

inventory of the medicines and surgical
instruments in the institution had been
taken. During the morning about six
people were brought â¢**** the place for
medical treatment, and there were four
calls for the ambulance. One case waa
that of a man with two cuts on his
scalp; another had a mangled hand.
and a woman had a broken thumb. In
every instance the patients were ad
vised to go to the City and County
Hospital.
There are no food inspectors on the
front since the Board of Health prac
tically went out of existence. Yester
day forty head of cattle came down
from Petaluma on the steamer Gold.
They were all diseased, and looked as
though they had originally been sent to
Petaluma to be used as chicken feed;
but when the news of the removal of
the inspectors on the front came the
owner changed his mind and sent them
to San Francisco for family use. The
veterinary surgeon went out with the
other employes of the Board of Health,
so Dr. Lawlor had to go down to Wash
ington-street wharf and examine the
animals. As they all looked diseased
he hunted up the veterinary surgeon,
who looked the animals over carefully
and said thirty out of the forty were
suffering from tuberculosis. He quar
antined the band, and they, will all
probably be destroyed to-day.
Dr.. Barbat, one of the board, said
yesterday that tne reason for the clos
ing of the City Receiving Hospital was
on account of the bad sanitary condi
tion of the quarters. He said that as
soon as the necessary improvements
were finished it would reopen. The
Health Board begins to recognize its
error, and a plumber Is called in to
stop the leak.
The Harbor Commissioners notified
the Health Board yesterday afternoon
that they would furnish two physi
cians, Drs. Van der Leith and Him
melsbach if the Health Board would
feed the two horses for the ambulance
and pay the driver. The compact has
been made.
An injustice was inadvertently done
to Dr. Morrison of the Receiving Hos
pital In these columns yesterday. It
was stated that he had refused admis
sion to the hospital to Private Riley, a
soldier, who was suffering from a cut
on the wrist. Dr. Morrison had left
the Receiving Hospital and was on his
way to the Harbor Hospital when Pri
vate Riley demanded treatment, and
he had nothing to do with the case.
The error occurred through the con
fusion of names transmitted by tele
phone.
BEGGED A PLACE IN
WHICH TO LIE DOWN
PITIABLE CONDITION OF A
HOMELESS YOUNG WOMAN.
"With tears coursing down her cheeks
pretty Elizabeth Adams, aged 16 years,
Monday appeared at the gate of the City
Prison and begged to be given a place in
which -to sleep.
"I am so tired and hungry." she tear
fully exclaimed, "and being without i
friends or money I am compelled to seek
charity."
After listening to her sad words Cor
poral Hiekey promptly admitted the young
woman and turned her over to the mat
ron. 'â¢'.'.. .;
To the latter she said that she arrived
here yesterday from Contra Costa Coun
ty, intending to seek employment. She
had $3 75 in her purse and as she walked
along Market street her attention was. at
tracted to the numerous crowds that were
waiting for the arrival of the Nebraska
heroes.
"Anxious to see the boys in blue who
had fought for their country," she patri
otically remarked, "I mingled with the
crowd at Market and Stockton streets and
anxiously awaited the arrival of the
troops. As they appeared I lustily cheered
them and in my enthusiasm I forgot my
purse, containing all the money I had in
the world. As the soldiers passed I
thought of my purse and quickly placed
my hand in my pocket. To my intense
surprise it was gone. I remembered that
while I was cheering the brave soldiers
I felt a young man brush up against me
and it at once dawned upon me that I had
been robbed. I lost no time in finding a
policeman, to -whom I told the story of
my loss. He advised me to report the
robbery at police headquarters, but anx
ious to get the thief before he had an
opportunity to do away with the evidence
of his guilt I started out to find him. Af
ter walking all day without getting a
trace of him 1 concluded to seek shelter
in the prison, as I had no other place to
go."
Corporal Hiekey, on learning that the
ilnforunate young woman had not eaten
anything since early yesterday morning,
ordered the prison cook to prepare a sub
substantial supper . for her. As the girl
seems anxious to' get employment the
prison officials, intend-to apply to some
charitable institution with a view of ob
taining a position for her. -
MURDERER HOFF
HAS ANOTHER
SHOW FOR LIFE
Given a New Trial by
Supreme Court.
â Â»
JUDGE WALLACE'S ERRORS
â â¦ â â 
DISCUSSED TOO MANY FACTS IN
STEAD OF THE LAW.
â¢ 4,
Mrs. Mary A. Clute's Slayer Has His
Neck Temporarily Saved on
Account of Techni
calities.
The Supreme Court has granted to Al
bert Vereneseneckockockhoff, otherwise
known as Albert Hoff, condemned to be
hanged for murder, a new trial. The crime
for which he was adjudged guilty and sen
tenced to suffer the extreme penalty of
the law is still fresh in the minds of most
of the people of this city, and especially
those living in the Mission. Mrs. Mary
Augusta ('lute moved from Fell street to
a new residence on Guerrero street, near
Eighteenth, and she hired HofT to lay her
carpets. That was on December 35. IS9*.
Later in the day the unfortunate woman
was found dead in one of the rooms. S.he
had been beaten to death with some blunt
instrument, supposed to be a hammer.
Hoff was seen going to the place, and wit
nesses saw him depart, yet no one wit
nessed the shocking crime. He was ar
rested and though the evidence against
him was strong it was purely circum
stantial. The trial took place before Su
perior Judge Wallace. *
While the links in the chain of evidence
were tightly drawn around the accused,
still the motive of the crime, if he was the
murderer, was missing, and this formed
one of the most important features of the
case being sent back to the lower court
for a new trial.. The appeal was based
upon the rulings complained of, which re
lated to the giving or refusing to give In
structions. In discussing the proceedings
of the lower court the higher tribunal
says:
Here the court tells the jury that
there are two main facts to be made
out by the prosecution: first, that a
crime" has been committed, and, sec
ond, that the defendant committed it;
and then proceeds to discuss the im
portance of the proof of motive. It
is recognized that motive is not the ul
timate fact to be proven, but the proof
or disproof of any motive or induce
ment to commit the crime is merely
evidentiary In its character, but is an
Important consideration, especially in
a case depending upon circumstantial
evidence.
The only matter of law in all this
is that the motive is not the ultimate
fact to be proven, and. of course, Â»it
would follow from this that if the com
mission of the crime by the defendant
be sufficiently proven it does not mat
ter whether there appears to have been
a motive or not. This is certainly true
in this class of cases. The presence
or absence of motive is matter of cor
roborationâor. rather, it makes other
evidence more or less persuasive. It
increases or diminishes the presump
tion of. Innocence, and in this case it
would have no other function. And this
is recognized in the charge, which nev
ertheless proceeds to tell the jury how
difficult it is to prove motive, and
states that "It may be in many cases
impossible to show or to establish a mo
tive, for the reason that we cannot
fathom the mind of the accused on
trial and ascertain if there is not a
hidden desire of vengeance or some
passion to be gratified: besides, there is
no rule of law which determines what
is or what is not an adequate motive,
even if it were necessary to show one."
Applying tills to the case, the Jury
were told that although the prosecu
tion might not he able to prove it, the
defendant may have had "a hidden de
sire of vengeance or some passion to
be gratified." This was not a statement
of a rule of law, but an argument
against the defendant on the facts, and
the court proceeds at some length with
this argument to the jury, claiming
that it is often impossible for the pros
ecution to prove the motive, though
one existed. â¢ * Â» Section 19. Article
VI of the constitution reads as follows:
"Judges shall not charge juries with
respect to matters of fact, but may
state the testimony and declare the
law."
Justice McFarland dissented, but wrote
no opinion. Justice Garoutte wrote a dis
senting opinion, in which he stated that
while he considered the charge by the
trial Judge to be too long, he did not be
lieve that the jury was misguided by the
court's remarks. The Justice says that
while he will always stand for the pro
tection of the interests of any one com
ing before the higher court, he does not
think it necessary to cut too close to the
line of technicalities for the purpose of
finding some flaw in the work of the low- |
er courts. - j
SMOOT IS ARRESTED.
He Denies Any Knowledge of the
Conspiracy and Can Prove His
Innocence.
E. N. Smoot, the saloon-keeper at
Larkin and McAllister streets, returned,
as he said, from a fishing trip yesterday
afternoon and was arrested by Detective
Ed Gibson and booked at the City Prison
on the charge of obtaining money by false
pretenses from Mrs. Carroll. He gave $500
cash bail and was released.
Smoot says that lie will not make any
statement for publication till a day or
two. when he has had an opportunity of
consulting his attorney. He denies ac
knowledge of the conspiracy and declares
that he had not seen or spoken to "Brick"
McPhersoii for a year. McPherson is still
