MANILA, Aug. 31.â Preparations j
are being made to inflict severe |
punishment upon the brigands
who for some time have been
causing much trouble In the
island of Cebu. Robbers under the
gruise of insurgents have taken advant- .
age of the situation to commit all sorts
of depreciations, and it has finally been
decided the time has arrived to put an
end to their operations. Heretofore
General Otis has been inclined to leave !
the islands in the lower part of the j
archipelago practically alone until the
insurgents in Luzon were conquered.
His idea was simply to hold those
islands, without carrying on military i
operations, until Aguinaldo's insurrec- j
tion was quelled.
The pseudo rebels took advantage of
this plan and lade themselves dnnger
ous nuisances. They have intimidated
many of the peacefully inclined inhab- !
itants by threatening to assassinate
them, and in addition to much spoil j
have gained considerable accessions to
their bar . So extensive have their :
operations become that they have suc
ceeded in. paralyzing the business of j
the entire island. Noninterference with !
the lawless proceedings added to their j
boldness, and, thinking the Americans I
too weak to resent their acts, they re- >
cently had the hardihood to assume the â¢
offensive. They have attacked small j
reconnoitering parties and in the fight- !
ing that followed two American officers I
â were wounded.
Last Friday morning a band of na- !
tives waylaid four men going to C^-bu
from El Pardo. The Americans were
ambushed, but made a. brave fight for
their lives. Ultimately, however, three
of the party were killed and their
bodies were horribly mutilated.
The fourth man escaped and reported
the affair to the commander at Cebu.
Orders were at once given to hunt the
brigands and Colonel- Bayless of th' '
Tennessee Regiment, with a company
of that command and a company of the
Twenty-third regular infantry, started
from Cebu. while Captain Allaire with
a company of the Twenty-third In
fantry started from El Pardo to
attack the natives. Colonel Bay.
less moved up the valley w.hi'.e
Captain Allajre moved down, hoping to
catch th* 1 enemy in the center. They
succeeded in clearing the valley, but
the en*Â»my took to the hills.
While this operation was going on
Captain Allaire saw an insurgent try
ing to shoot an American officer. Cap
tain Allaire took a rifle from one of his ;
men and shot the rebel, who, it was
subsequently proved, was an insurgent \
general.
It was decrded not to pursue th* |
rebels into the hills until a stronger |
force was procured. On Sunday two !
companies of the Sixth regulars arrived |
from Negros Island. On Monday Col
onel Bayless, with a # greatly augmented j
force, started out to again move j
agai-nst the rebels. His command con-
Eisted of parts of eight Infantry com
panies, with one 3.20-inch gun belong
ing to the Sixth Artillery. The com
mand' was divided into two parts, one
of which moved out from El Pardo
while Colonel Bay.- - took the other
from Guadeloupe.
The brigands had retreated to an
Intrenched position in the hills within
plain sight of Cebu. The hills are very
rough an I steep and the country bad
for military operations. The position
occupied by the rebels was protected
by three lines of trenches, with caves
and bombproofs, at an elevation of
over a thousand feet. The day was hot,
making the work of the troops hard.
After desperate work the Americans
reached the top of the Paid.- hills, but
fo exhausted the>' could go no further.
The rebels, however, had been driven
to higher ground, and meantime
Colonel Bayless was advancing with
his command from Guadeloupe. The
rebels offered strong resistance to his
advancing. They had six cannons
loaded with serapiron. but the marks
manship being extremely bad the lire
had no effect. The Americans had ter
rific- work in traversing the. country.
They killed eight buffaloes trying to
drag a gun into position, and finally
the men had to haul it themselves four
miles over the roughest possible coun
try.
The enemy was stationed high above
the Americans and the latter were'un
able to respond to the fire owing to the
elevation. As the! day wore on the ex
treme heat and exertion of campaign
ing in such a wilderness exhausted the
Americans, eighty of whom were un
able to take position. Colonel Bayless,
however, determined to teach the en
.' m a lesson, and finally got position
partly up the hills, where he had the
rebels in range. Then he opened a hot
fire on them find in a short time drove
them from the lower trenches and a
considerable distance up the heights.
The Americans made no attempt to
hold the captured position, but re
turned to Cebu that night.

PHILIPPINE PORTS TO BE
CLOSED TO COMMERCE
0 WASHINGTON, Aug. 31.â new and, it is believed, effective means
â¢â¦â  of preventing the Luzon insurgents obtaining supplies from the out
Â£ side will probably be put in operation by Major General Otis and Rear
O Admiral Watson within a short time. The matter will be taken up
â¦ for consideration when President McKinley returns to Washington
Saturday. , , â¢ . . '
o The Government has been aware for several months that the â  in
*â  surgents were -securing food and ammunition from places outside the
o island, and every effort has been made to stop the traffic. The recent
â â¦" addition to the naval force in the Philippines of light-draft gun
Â° boats captured or purchased from Spain has been followed by a great
"*" many captures of filibustering craft, mostly small schooners, but owing
? to certain international considerations interdiction of insurgent sup
c plies has not been so effective as the Government desires. jj From the
â¦â  first the Navy Department has Insisted that the only sure means of
Â° preventing the traffic was by the establishment of a blockade of all
o ports in the island of Luzon, and this has just been followed by a for
â¦â  mal recommendation by the department to that effect.
Â° While there does not appear to be any difference of opinion as to
q the excellence of this policy among officers of the State, War and Navy
4- departments, some of those in authority have questioned the advisa-
O bility of pursuing such a course on the ground it would give foreign
Â£ nations an excuse for recognizing the belligerency of the insurgents. ..
+ Under international law a nation cannot blockade its own ports,
o and for the United States to declare a blockade of the ports in the
"*" Philippines would be virtually to acknowledge" a state of war .existed,
Â° that the Filipinos were maintaining a government of. their own and ex
o ercising it within certain territory. . '
â â¦â  Whether any means Of overcoming the objection can be found re
o mains to be seen, but the officials here are confident the. conference
*â  with the President will result in the adoption of a plan which, when
Â° put into operation, will effectually phut off the means now possessed by
â *" the insurgents of securing outside aid.
Â£ It is proposed, as a means of meeting the difficulty, that an order
O be issued closing all ports, with the exception of Manila, to outside
â¦ trade. Such action would not constitute a declaration of a blockade
% and would not furnish an excuse for foreign Governments to recog
-0 nixe insurgent belligerency.

town was guarded by a detachment of
sailors and marines from the gunboat
Bennington. The Americans sustained
no losses, though many were exhaust
ed by the arduous work. It is impos
sible to estimate the loss of the enemy.
It is reported the rebels recently re
ceived 330 rifles in addition to those al
ready owned by them. It is believed
they* now possess 500 rifles. The de
struction of the rebel stronghold
would probably result in ending the
troubles in Cebu. but the work will be
most difficult of accomplishment ow
ing- to the extremely hilly nature of the
country.
The cruiser Charleston drove the
rebels out of position. She delivered
twenty-eight eight-inch shells at SSOO
yards. The work would have been
more effective had it not been that
neither she nor the other warships
have any shrapnel. They are only sup
plied with percussion shells, which do
not answer the purpose for which
-hells, are n/Myi >3 . here. â¢ Th^y .'.â should
have shells with time fuses.
Colonel Bayless' experience with the
iy indicates the rebels will not
hesitate to stand up and fight. This
is what the Americans want, for in
thai case it will be possible to sur
round them and completely destroy
Them. In view of recent events it may
he that General Otis will conclude this
would be a result worth accomplish
ing without waiting for the end of the
Luzon campaign.

Worry Over Criticisms of
His Campaign.
VICTORIA. B. C.. Aug. 31.â General
Otis is a sick man. He is not fever
stricken, or suffering from any of the
general ailments that affect his troops,
but worry and lack of nerves, supple
mented by the knowledge that criticism
of his acts must bo adverse, have com

Special Dispatch^ to The Call.
LIVERMORE. Aug. 31.â A tragedy
which Is as yet shrouded in mystery <â¢ -
curred at an early hour this morning on
the Patterson pass road about eight miles
from f hi.= place. Oliver Holmes, an aged
farmer, was killed, and his brother
George^ almost an octogenarian, is in jail
charged with his murder.
The Holmes brothers were old settlers
in the Llvermcre Valley, having come
here In' the pioneer days from Utah,
v here they i ere followers of Brignam
Ycuiigrl They were both poor men living
on a rented farm, but have always been
repnrdec as peaceable men and straight
In all their dealings.
Oliver Holmes was a married man,
having been united to his stepmother
after Ids father's death, according 'to
Mormon custom. He had a numerous
family, most of whom resided on the
farm. Gforge Holmes was a single man
and lived with his brother. At an early
hour this morning, while the family
breakfsst was being prepare';, George
Holmes undertook to chastise a young
grandson nf his brother's who had been
annoying him.
The elder Holmes thought his tr*at
mc nt unnecessarily harsh and objected.
This led to a dispute and finally to blows,
and the old men. forgetting their Altai
tie?, engaged in deadly combat. George
grabbed hi? brother by the throat, and
notwithstanding an effort was made to
separate them It was too late to save j
Omer's life, as he expired within a few
seconds. Word was sent to Livermore
and a warrant was issued for the ar.-e.-st
of George Holmes.
The lecal officers who made the arrest
woo. told t he-story as it is related ab-ive",
but tlie accused brother strenuously de
nk-d it. as did one of the sons, Joseph
Holmes; who was arrested for complicity,
1 uvint aided his uncle in the struggle.
Both ciaim that Oliver ' Holmes died from
heart disease or some like seizure in
duced by the excitement of the encounter.
Jost-rh Holmes was released upon the ar
rival of the party in Livermore, but
George Holmes was lodged in the town
jail, where he was seen by. a Call repre
sentative this evening.
Upon being asked if he had choked his
brother during the 'encounter George de
ci.'ived that not only had he not done so,
but ir reality -that he had been choked
by both his brother and sister-in-law.
and that he had been set upon by all the
members of the family except Joseph,
who had interceded in his behalf, and on
that account had been accused by the
others of being an accessory. He stoutly
maintained that his brother had lived for
a quarter if an hour after the encounter
and had fallen from his chair as if from
an attack of heart disease.
The body was brought to Livermore late
this evening and an inquest will be held
to-morrow, which may bring out facts
that will clear up the mystery surround
ing the tragedy.
FALLING OFF IN
THE PENSION ROLL
WASHINGTON, Aug. 31.â The an
nual report of Hon. H. Clay Evans,
missioner of Pensions, shows that
during the year there were added to
the pennon roll 40,229 names, and
43,188 were dropped, 34,345 of these by
n of death. There was expended
for pensions $138,355,052. The roll is
made up of 753,451 surviving soldiers,
237,415 widows and dependent rela
tives and 653 nurses. The total num
ber of original applications filed dur
ing the year, including those on ac
count of the war with Spain, .was
48,766.
The number of original claims al
lowed was 37.077. During the year
107,919 claims of all classes were" re
jected, a large percentage of these be
ing claims for increase. The report
will state that the delay in the adjudi
cation of claims ii> in nearly every case
the fault of the claimants or their at
torneys. In order that the present
complex system of pensioning may be
simplified and to secure a more uni

BITTER DENUNCIATION
OF SENATOR GOEBEL
LEXINGTON, Ky., Aug. 31.âEx-Con
gressman Claibuurne Owens, who defeated
Colonel "W. C. P. Breckinridge in 1894, ad
dressed the voters in Main-street Audi
torium to-night and answered Senator
William Goebel's charges made at Bowl
ing Green on Monday.
It was the most scathing arraignment
ever made of a political candidate in Ken
tucky, and if it does nut mean pistois
Kentuckiuns will have to take down their
lighting sign. He referred to Goebel as a
"Conscienceless creature," and declared
what he said about him was. "malicious
and false." He declared Goebel was not
a member of the Legislature when the law
making gambling a. felony was passed
;ad nothing to do with its passage.
Continuing, he said in part:
Goebel is a man whose word is not
taken at. any counter In Kentucky. He
wants to know why I am opposed to
him. I am opposed to him because he
haÂ« violated the three commandments,
"Thou Bhalt not lie," "Thou shalt not
steal " "Thou shalt not kill." I am op
posed to Mr. Goebel because in cold
blood and premeditation he has vio
lated all three of these command
ments I wouM not touch on the vio
lation of the command, "Thou shalt not
kill" were not an attempt being made
to blacken the name of the dead ("ol
onel John Sanfonl. whom he slew,
and which act drove Sanfords wife
to a madhouse.
And this is the reason I am oppos
ing the election of Goebel., I have
convicted him as being a murderer,
liar and thief. It *\ill be ;i crime
against society, iigainst right and
against Kentucky and the Democratic
party to give him a single vote. The
only way to correct this evil that has
c.me upon the Democratic party in
Kentucky is to crush Goebel and his
brazen gang at the polls tn November.
DREYFUS WEEPS WHEN HIS
DEGRADATION IS RECALLED
Rennes Prisoner at Last Breaks Down Under the
Severe Mental Strain,
Forzinetti Tells of the Accused Man's Desire to Commit Suicide
Before His Public Disgrace, and Dreyfus Thanks His
Wife for Haying Prevented the Act.
RENNES, Aver. 31.â Dreyfus had
the most trying day he has yei
gone through. The strain proved
too great for him. and for the
second time in the course of the
trial he pave way to his ft-r-lings and |
sought relief in tears. The g-enerals
have branded him as a trnko r b<
the court. their subordinates have
pointed the fintrer of scorn at him. Rut |
he has only once flinchedâ when the
official report of his treatment or.
Devils Island was read before him and
the picture of his sufferings, mental
and physical, was thrown vividly on ]
the screen of his memory. Then he hid
his features and wppt.
He passed through another such
crisis to-day when, after Captain T,e
brun-Renaud and witness after wit
ness had brought before him that cold
January morning which ushered in the
â¢ of his degradation. Major Forzi
netti, a man of heart, told in simple
words and unaffected manner th â 
story of Dreyfus' struggle with the
maddening temptation to take his life
and the intervention of his wife, as an
angel, pointing out the road of duty.
Then again the prisoner's breast
heaved with emotion and teardrops
trickled down his cheeks. He arose, 'â â 
and. after a forced effort to remain
calm as he spoke a few words concern
ing his denial to Colonel Dv Paty that |
hÂ° wrote the bordereau, he turned to i
Forzinetti with a look of thanks for
his consolation, so needed. Dreyfus
then uttered these -words of heartfelt j
gratitude to his wife for the courage
with which she inspired him:
'â¢It is due to her," he cried, "that I
am alive to-day."
The prisoner could articulate no
more, but sat down abruptly to con
ceal his distress.
The proceedings concluded a few
minutes later and he was taken back
to prison, where his wife visited him,
and in the presence of Mine. Dreyfus
and the gendarme guard he broke
dov/n completely. The tension had
been too much for him. He sobbed
convulsively, and the partner of his
sorrow joined him in a solace of tears.
Captain Lebrun-Renaud and the
supporters of his assertion of the Drey
fus confession had an inning lasting
nearly the entire session, their deposi
tions containing little but what has
already been stated before the Court of
cassation. Captain Lebrun-Renaud
introduced the new assertion that the
fact that he had not related the inci
dent of the confession to President
Casimir-Perier was because he over
heard himself called "Canaille," "Cur"
and "Traitor" n-bfii waiting at the
Elysee He, !. â  â  â¢ "could not ex
plain why he kept this to himself for
so iong a time instead of recounting th?
Incident before the Court of Cassation.

containing- the record of Dreyfus' con
fession sound very convincing.
The other witnesses were a repetition
of Captain Lenrun-R^naud. But a
very significant question was put t"
Colonel Guerin by a member of the
court. Lieutenant Colonel Brr.ng-niart.
who sits at Colonel Joauast's ristu
hand and always puts pointed ques
tions. Ho has thoroughly studied the
Dreyfus case, and is reputed to be one
of the best authorities on the case. It
is certain Colonel Joauast consults
him frequently during the proceedings.
BrongpQiart Is said to be a rabid anti-
Dreyfusard, and he to-day, in a quiet
tone. asked Colonel Guerin if he
thought that Weyl, who is a friend r Â»f
Esterhazy, also knew Dreyfus. The
latter at once arose and declared he
hnd never before heard of Weyl. ThÂ«
V>"int of this question was that Ester
hazy had written to Colonel Jouaust, as
announced, and has undoubtedly men
tioned Weyl as a go-between for
Dreyfus. This is thÂ» person referred to
in yesterday's dispatch as "V." a mis
take for "W." If relations can be
proven between Dreyfus and Weyl,
then he could assume Dreyfus was a
traitor. The generals, if sufficient evi
dence of a DreyfuÃ-Weyl-Esterhasy
connection could be produced, csjn
abandon the contention that Dreyfus
wrote the bordereau and admit that
Esterhazy was the author of it. This.
Is possibly the change of tactics on th^
part of the generals which has been
hinted at recently.
It was reported this afternoon that
Generals Mercier. Roget and' Gonse,
and M. Cavaignac. who are Btaylng
quietly at the house of a friend som- 1
miles outside Renn'es, met to-day at
General Mercier's house and discusse-i
the evidence Colonel Sch\varzk"ppen's
housekeeper, Mme. Batkin. could Rive
if she was subjected to a severe exam
ination, with the result that her- evi
dence was not conclusive enough to
justify summoning her as a witness for
the prosecution.
LEBRUN-RENAUD
GIVES TESTIMONY
Tells of an Alleged Confession, and Is
Answered by the Man on
Trial.
RENNES, Aug. 31.â The fourth session
of the fourth -week of the second trial
by court-martial of Captain Alfred Drey- ;
\ fus of the artillery, charged with treason.
I opened behind closed doors, so continuing ;
until 9:15 a. m. In addition to tho usual
i cordons of troops in. the streets leading '
to the Lyeee an extra guard was posted <
so as to completely isolate the hall in
I which the judges met in secret session. â 
! In closed session the court discussed the
secret documents relating to the artillery .
I subjects of the bordereau.
The first witness called after the public j
I session began was Captain I/^brun-
Renaud of the Republican Guard, who
i reiterated his testimony given before the \
Court of Cassation, repeating the terms
of the alleged confession of Dreyfus:
"I am innocent. In three years they
will recognize my innocence. The Min
i ister knows it. If I delivered documents'!
to Germany it was to get more important
ones in return."
The witness' explanation that he did not
refer to the confession of Dreyfus in his
I interview with President Casimir-Perler, j
i because he overheard a conversation dur- j
i ing the course of which he was called i
"traitor." "canaille" a/id "cur." came as
a surprise, for he did not mention this In I
PETCE FIVE CENTS.
his evidence before the Court of Cassa
tion, as M. Labori. leading counsel for
the defense, pointed out. M. Labori also
laid stress on the fact. that Captain Le
brun-'. should have kept his note
book, in which he asserts he made a note
of his conversation with Dreyfus, for fdur
years and would have destroyed it on
the very morrow the matter was brought
up in debate in the Chamber of Deputies.
The captain's reply that he looked upon
the copy made by M. Cavaigriac, then
Minister o-f War. as being sufficient, was
considered rather lame.
Dreyfus. replying to the witness, began
by calmly declaring that Captain Le
bcun-Renaud's statement that a certain
Captain d'Attel was present during his
conversation with Captain Lehrun-Re
naud was inaccurate. The witness, bow
ever,maintained that Captain d'Attel was
present, whereupon Dreyfus said that if
he was present he (.the prisoner^ did not
speak to him.
Dreyfus then raised his voice excitedly,
and. accompanying his words with short,
emphatic gestures of the right hand and
quivering with emotion, protested that
Captain LeT>run-Renaud should have re
peated to his chiefs his utterances, which
began with a protestation of innocence,
without asking him to explain his words.
"Those are maneuvers." cried the pris
oner, "whic.i must till all honest men
with Indignation." This declaration of
the prisoner made a d^ep impression on
the audience. Dreyfus spoke the last
words through his teeth and was evident-
Iv laboring under the greatest excitement
and indignation. The audience broke into
"bravos, " which the gendarmes . sup
pressed. , ' Â
Captain Antherne followed and re
. .... Captain d'Attel had said
confirming the confession. Dreyfus re
plied that he had not spoken to Captain
d'Attel. On being recalled. Captain Le
brun-Renaud said this was true, but he
added that Captain d'Attel was present
and could have heard the conversation.
M Labori here pointed out that Cap
tain d'Attel had not spoken to his chiefs
on this subject, and General Mercier,
who. like all the military witnesses, fol
lowed the proceedings to-day with the
keenest; interest arose, and admitted that
this was correct.
Colonel Jouaust told Dreyfus that he
had not explained why he mentioned the
term of three years, to which Dreyfua
replied:
â â ; did not give three years as the term.
I only said I hoped that in the course of
two or three years my innocence would
be recognized. And I wish to state,
my colonel, that as my letters to General
Gonse show, my words did not have the
sense evil minds have sought to give
M- Labor! then had General Gonse
called to the bar and asked him if he had
not used the alleged confession of Drey
fus in opposing Pi quart arguments in
favor of a revision. General Gonse re
plied that he had not, whereupon M. La
bori asked that the letters exchanged be
tween General Gonse and Colonel Pic
quart should be read. The clerk of the
court began to read a letter beginning
"My dear Picquart," when General Gonse
interrupted him .and asked that Colonel-
Picquart's previous letter be read first,
but as the letter was not available for
the moment the reading of all the letters
was adjourned until to-morrow.
Major Forzinetti. who was governor of
the ChereJie Midi Prison during the time
Dreyfus was imprisoned there and who
testified in behalf of Dreyfus, declaring
he had never heard of the confession
Dreyfus is said to have made, was the
next witness called. He repeated his tes
timony given before the Court of Cassa
tion, adding that he frequently met Cap
tain Lebrun-Renaud and Captain d At
tel, and that neither of them ever alluded
to the alleged confession. The witness
declared that he once taxed Captain Le
brun-Renaud before General Gonse and
other witnesses with saying he had spok
en to the witness (Major For?lnetl of
the confession, and that Captain Le
brun-Renaud did not reply.
"Whereupon," Major 'Forzinetti paid,
â¢'I seized his arm and said. 'If the word*
repeated as yours are true, you are an
infamous liar!' "
Major Forzinetti then declared that on
visiting General de Boisdeffre to express
fears about the health of the prisoner,
the general asked him his opinion of the
Dreyfus case and the major replied:
"My general, had you not put that
question to. me I would have kept my
counsel. But since you ask my opinion,
I declare I believe he is innccent.
The witness then recounted Colonel Dv
Paty de Clam's theatrical devices to sur-
Drise Dreyfus, to which Forzinetti d#2

PRETORIA, Aug. President Kruger
to-day announced to the Volksraad-that he
had received a telegram from the Governor
of Mozambique saying the detained am
munition would be forwarded immediate

Vtie imperial and Transvaal governments
was read in open session, and President
Kruger asked the Raad to meet secretly
to-night for the purpose of considering
ii reply.
President Kru also claimed that in
the convention in 1851 the suzerainty of
Great Britain was distinctly stated. But,
he added; there was no mention of it
in the convention of 1884. lie denied the
Government had excluded the British
from political rights.
A member of the Executive Council ex
plained that when the Transvaal's reply
to the joint commission's dispatch was
ready the State Attorney interviewed the
British diplomatic agent, Mr. Conyng
ham Green, in consequence of which the
last reply framed held that Mr. Cham
berlain's dispatch was no reply to theirs.
Mr. Green then cabled to Great Britain
certain suggestions; to which Great Brit-
In replied that If the Transvaal made
similar proposals they would be consid
ered on their merits. This was the reply
containing the alternative proposals of
yesterday.

Th.- declaration of Dreyfus that his life
was due to his wife deeply stirred' all
his hearers. He spok^ in a. hroken voice.
with emphatic i swaying to and

cause he had -received instructions to
keep silent. Ueneral Boisdeffre denied
that Major Forzinetti had expressed lo
him his conviction that Dreyfus was In

Mysterious Death of G. O. Canaziani,
a Section* Boss on the North

SAN RAFAEL. Aug. 31.â Meager details
reached this city to-night of the death
of a section boss employed by the North
Pacific Coast Railway Company, which
occurred near Howards station to-day un
der mysterious circumstances. The "name
of the man was G. O. Canaziani. He was
found banging acrow a rail fence and
had been dead several hours. Thp north
bound train which connects with the l>out
leaving San Francisco at 7 o'clock in thfi
morning had reached a point about a mile
south <il Howards station when one of
the railroad employes perceived the body
"f Canaziani hanging face downward
ai ross a rail fence on the left side of the
road. The train was stopped and backed
up and the remains taken to Howards
station. As the body was discovered
across the boundary line in Sonoma
County the Coroner was notified at Santa
Rosa and an inquest will be held to-mor
row.
Though no visible marks of a wound
wire to be discovered foul play is BUB
-pel ted for several reasons. The peculiar
posit! hi of the body and the Improbability
of the deceased going so fur from human
habitation alone are advanced In support
of such ii theory. while quarrels and bick
erings among the mcmln'rn of Canamlani'a
race in thip lonely region along the shores
of Tomales Bay have frequently resulted
in bloodshed and caused feuds of many
years' duration.

GANG'S WIDE RANGE
Its Operations Conduced Through
out the Central Part of
the State.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, Aug. 31.â At a special
i session of- the Grand Jury this morning
called for the purpose two indictments
were returned against G. â¢ W"., Van Nor
man, a junk dealer of this city/ The in
dictments were based upon the confes
! sions of \v. H. Gestner and Frederick
I Stephan, two grain-sack thieves; who
were arrested several weeks ago. In these
confessions there is revealed a condition
â  of affairs the existence of which was little
dreamed of. The confessions are to the
effect that a gang of thieves with its
headquarters at Sacramento has been op
erating throughout Central California for
; the past year. Scores of thefts and burg
j laries committed wiring the past twelve
months in Sacramento, Solo, Solano and
San Joaquin counties were the work of
this gang. All goods stolen were brought
to Sacramento and turned over to Van
Norman, who was told in every instance,
so the confession states, where the goods j
came from and how they Were obtained. :
More than this. Van Norman is said to j
â  have directed the gang In its movements, â ;
! lent them vehicles and tools to work with :
â¢ and kept them strictly posted as to- the .
movements of the police. I
tip to a short time ago the principal
, plunder of the gang was brass, The war ,
with Spain had brought the market price
. of this up to 16 or 17 cents a pound, and
Van Norman bought it from the thieves |
; tinder his direction for 7 cents, .shipping
i it. so it is claimed, to Charles Harley, S4t
Harrison street, San Francisco. The steal
: ing of brass Is said to have been brought
to a close by a letter received by Van
; Norman from Harley notifying him to.
cease shipments, as the police were
I watching the dock. Before this letter was
! received the gang engaged in a series of j
I operations, during which it. did thousands
lof dollars' worth of damage. On one oc
casion the members of the gang broke the
brass fittings from valuable gold-mining
machinery near Folsom. A few days later
, they tore the brass fittings from two big
dredgers down the Sacramento River,
near Txaskla Landing. They then worked
up the river past \yalnui Grove, Court
land and other places, wrecking valuable
pumping plants in the differ* nt tarna
| tion districts in order to get the brass
work, in this way. the gang got many
hundreds of pounds of brass, all of which j
they sold to Van Norman.
Not content with this haul, the gang
turned its attention to the railroad yards
'. In Tracy. There, on one occasion, they
secured 800 pounds of brass. "Working up
to Sacramento with this, they wrecked
: pumping plants and dredgers throughout
an Joaquin County, making a haul Bo
i rich that they tried it over again a few i
days later, with equally good success. A
! third trip was planned to Tracy, but was I
abandoned upon the receipt of Harley's
letter from San Francisco. i
The gang then turned its attention to
stealing grain and grain sacks. Thou- I
sands of sacks were stolen and hundreds
of bags of grain, scores of ranchers
throughout Central California suffering
: from the- raids. A large part of this plun
der was found in Van Norman's posses
! sion.
. When, first questtyietl he dejiied that he
had any iuch property and, when it was
found, claimed that he had forgotten
about it. Shortly after tils arrest to-day
Van Norman was confronted by Gestner
and Stephan, who repeated the stories
told In their confessions. Van Norman en- j
tered a general denial, and was taken. to
jail in $4000 bonds. The entire mass of evi
dence upon which Van Norman was ar
rested, together with the arrest of Gest
-1 ncr and St. phan and the confessions of I
these two, was the work of Max P. i
Fisher, a member of the police force of I
Sacramento and ex-County Detective. It
Is considered as one of the cleverest bits ,
of detective work ever accomplished in
this section. . ;

Dr. Evans Dosby,' secretary of the peace
section. London, presented the following
I reports of the committee on arbitration:
The conference accepts the report adopted by
the executive council on July IS, 1899, of the
special committee appointed at the London con
ference of 1593, which has. In accordance with
! the direction of the Rrussels conference In 1896,
i presented a scheme for the formation of the
i Court of International Arbitration.
The conference cordially thanks the commit
tee for the care with which It has thus com
pleted the work Intrusted to it, directs that the
scheme be printed in the proceedings of the
conference and commends it to public notice as
the association's contribution to the further
elucidation of the question.
This conference expresses Its deep grati
fication at the adoption by The Hague
I Peace Conference of a scheme of International
arbitration, which carries out one of the main
! objects of the association as expressed In re
! iterated resolutions of the time of it.-* opening
conference at Brussels In 1873. The conference
recognizes nx especially valuable the following
leading features of the scheme, viz.:
Firstâ The nomination of a body of men of
recognized competence In questions of interna
tional law, and enjoying public esteem, who
will he ready to act as arbitrators.
Secondâ The selection by parties to any in
ternational dispute from among the members
of the above-named body of arbitrators and an
umpire to form an arbitration tribunal.
Thirdâ The creation of a permanent adminis
trative council, composed of the diplomatic rep
resentative* nt the t'ourt of The Hague, with
The Netherlands' Minister of Foreign Affairs
as Its president.
Fourthâ The establishment under the direction
of the above-named council of a permanent bu
reau whose services will be at the disposal of
all arbitral tribunals.
The conference therefore urges the members
of tli" association to use their influence In their
respective countries (a) to procure the early
rÃtificatlon of The Hague convention relative to
thp settlement of international differences: (b)
to promot* treatlei between two or more states
agreeing to submit their differences to arbitra
tion under the provisions of the convention.
The conference decided that a special
committee bo appointed to examine in de
tail the provisions of The Hague conven
tion and prepare a report thereon for the
next conference.
The resolutions were' taken Up one by
one after brief addresses touching their
import and value. Charles H. Putler read
a paper on "Immunity of Private Prop
erty at Sea from Capture During- War."
He was followed by Thomas Barclay of
Paris on the same subject, after which
! the conference adjourned until to-morrow,
when a resolution will be offered on the
subject. '

WASHINGTON, Aug. 31.â
The Secretary of the Navy
1/ \/ has directed that" all esti
*â  * mates for the requirements
for the naval service next
year shall be submitted by to-morrow,
September 1, thus giving him three
months for co-ordinating them for
submission t<t Congress. Accordingly
the several naval bureaus have been
active of late preparing their final fig
ures, and all the estimates, with the
exception of those relating to armor
and ordnance, will be on hand to-mor
row. They show in general consider
able increase all along the line, owing
to th rapid developments of the navy,
the unprecedented amount of naval
I building now in progress and the
enlarged demands growing out of the
war and the acquisition of new terri
tory.
The largest item is J15.000.000. under
the head "Increase of the Navy,"
which is $5,000,000 more than any pre
vious estimate under this head. It is
due to the unusual number of war
ship? now in course of construction,
apart' trating fifty-four in ail classes, a
total much In excess of the number
under construction at any previous
time In the history of the navy. These
include eleven battleships, four moni
tors, three armored cruisers, six pro
tected crui?ers, thirty-three destroyers
and torpedo boats and several miscel
laneous craft, submarine boats, etc.
The item <>f "Increase of the Navy"
covers the work already, authorized
and now in course of construction,
h'-.th in engineering and structural
brahches.iand is concurred in by Ad
mirals Hichborn and Melville, chiefs of
the construction and of the engineer
ing bureaus, respectively.
Admiral Melville will also make es- j
timates for new engineering plants, I
equipment, tools, buildings, etc., at
Norfolk^ Port Royal. Port Orchard and |
I.latv Island. Cat The plants are old,
r>nd the requirements now made on j
th< in luce the chief engineer to '
i '-commend the most modern ap- ,
pliances and such remodeling of build- :
ir.es as will bring them up to date.
Admiral Endicott. chief of the bureau
of yards and docks, will recommend
two more large drydocks on the At- '
lantic seaboard, one at New York and ;
the other at Norfolk. The estimate i
will be about $1,250,000 each.
Admiral O'Nefl's estimate on annor 1
and ordnance will be held until his re
turn next Monday, as he has been giv
inc much personal attention to this '
it>-:n. The price of armor-plate will
have to be settled by Congress and a
large quantity of. armor authorized.
The armor concerns refused to bid on
the ?".''i f > fixed as the limit of cost by the
last Congress, so that further legisla
tion is necessary in order to provide
for the many ships now nearing com
pletion.
Aside from the bureau estimates the
Secretary of the Navy will prepare
such â¢ mates as he deems expedient ;
f>>r the new ships. There is no Intima- ;
tion thus far as to what new ships
will be recommended, but the impres
sion prevails in well informed naval
quarters that the Secretary will con
fine h>p recommendation to three 6000
--ton protected cruisers, to cost about ,
$1.2. r >f>.rtoo each. These were recom
mended last year and were the only ;
ships not authorized by Congress, so j
that it is thought likely the need of
them will again be presented.

SAOXAS. Aug. 31.â The greatest
in the history of Monterey

Sugar Factory at Spreckels were set in
motion, not to be stopp-d until the end
of the season, when the entire beet

made into sugar. T'nder the great

furnaces of crude oil, and out of the
two immense stacks of the factory are
pouring dense clouds of smoke to sig

For months am! months, from the
day the first spadeful of dirt was
turned on the site, the people of Salinas
and Pajaro valleys have looked forward
to this day. which means so much of
prosperity to them. It had at one time
been the Intention to celebrate the
event in some fitting public manner,
with a barbecue or some other grand
festival that would draw the people
from miles around to see the initial
revolutions of the new wheels of for

terey County could do was thought too
good to do on such an occasion. Some
time ago. however, it was decided by
the company that the best way to be
gin was to begin. The plant is of such
magnitude and the machinery so in
tricate that it was concluded that the
employes would be hampered by any
holiday crowds, for which very good
reason there was no celebration to-day
in honor of the portentous event. There
was no outburst of popular rejoicing.
The fires were lighted under the
boilers in the engine-house, smoke
spouted from the stacks. th>- steam was
released and the wheels began to turn.

McLEAN MAY RUN
FOR PRESIDENT
Prize That Attracts the
Ohioan.
Special Dippatch to The Call.
CALL HEADQTARTERS. WELLING
TON HOTEL, WASHINGTON. Aug. 31.â
John R. McLean's nomination as Demo
cratic candidate for Governor of Ohio
makes him a political factor that must
be taken into account in all calculations
as to the future of the party.
He has been an ardent supporter of
Bryan and the Chicago platform and has
allowed himself to be nominated on a
platform indorsing Bryan by name for
the Presidential nomination and reas
serting with emphasis the . declarations
made at Chicago, and yet he is on the
closest terms of political intimacy with
former Senator Gorman, Mr. Crbker of
New York and other leaders of the anti-
Bryan men in the party both East and
West. Mr. McLean will make a hard
fight for the Ohio Governorship, not bo
much for the sake of that office as for
what his fight may lead to, whether he
Is successful or not. The Presidency it
self Is a prize that is drawing Mr. Mc-
Lean forward.
His friends in the party say that .If
he wins the fight in Ohio this year it will
give him a prestige in the Democratic
convention next year that may even
sweep Mr. r Bryan out of the way. Mr.
McLean would probably "gladly consent
to allow the extreme Bryan men in the
party to frame a platform if they could
put Mr. McLean up to run on It.
Should he fall to win in Ohio this fall
he could hardly hope to secure the Pres
idential nomination next year, but he
will be a power in the national conven
tion nevertheless. He has secured con
trol of the Ohio organization and he will
go to the convention with the delegates
of -that State at his back, and probably
with alliances with other Middle West
and Eastern leaders.
If he cannot prevent the nomination of
Mr Bryan and secure the first place for
himself he will doubtless be able to ob
tain second place or to dispose of it as
Vi t* wi ** h** p â¢
Then as last resort, there is the Ohio
Senatorship. Senator Foraker's term will
expire on March 3, 1903, and falling in
both Presidency and Vice Presidency,
Mr McLean would be able to secure a
seat In the Senate If the Ohio Democrats
should be able to elect a Legislature in
the fall of 1902. .

it takes daily 1200 barrels of crude

450 tons of sugar will be extracted.

EXTRA SESSION PLANS.
Move to Reinstate Commissioner of
Public Works.
WOODLAND. Aug. 31.â An intimate
I friend of Senator Cutter informs The Call
correspondent that during a recent con
versation concerning the probabilities of
an extra session the Senator declared that
the Governor realizes the urgent neces
sity for a continuation of the work of
river improvement commenced by the
Commissioner of Public Works and deeply
regrets the legislative blunder as a re
sult of which the office has lapsed.
The Senator is confident that in the call
for an extra session the Governor will re
quest the Legislature to enact a law con
tinuing the office of Commissioner of Pub

SEARCH FOR THE
DUNHAM SKELETON
Keener Forgets Its Ex-
act Location.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
GILROY, Aug. 31. -Sheriff Langford, Un
der Sheriff John Reaves, Deputy Sheriff
: W. H. Stayton and P. H. Newberry re
! turned this evening from the Pacheco
Pass, where they went early Wednesday
morning in search of the skeleton of a
! man supposed to be James Dunham, found
i there on August 23 by Fred A. Keener of
I Visalia.
Keener accompanied the Sheriff's party
to a mountain pans and worked faithfully
all afternoon yesterday and this morning
j in a vain search for the point where he
came out in the Pacheco .road. The Sher
iff and his party had four saddle horses.
Reeve and Stayton are well acquainted
with the country, but it is so nearly alike
i that It was hard to locate the road. The
party returned to Gllroy to-night.
Sheriff Lamrford will return with an
, other searching party in a fexf days an<l
j go in from the old Stayton mines in San
; lienito County. Keener returned to iiis
home in Visalia, but says he will return
and assist the Sheriff in his search.
. Keener says the skeleton was clad in blue
overalls and a dark coat, badly rotted. No
shoes were visible, and this is one of the
best proofs that the body is that of Dun
ham, for it la known that Dunham trav
eled about the hills with sacks about his
feet. He was traced at the lime to the
Mountain House, where he was seen by i
i a vaquero. Later that day Under Sheriff |
j Gardner ami Constable Reeves found a
! couple of sacks at a small stream in the
| mountains in the *ame direction that the
j skeleton was found.
The report that the remains may be
those of Thomas Dougherty, who wan
dered from ais home in Gilroy last Octo
ber, is not believed in Gilroy, for when
last seen Dougherty was walking across
the fields in a westerly direction, and the
Pacheco Pass is southeast of Gilroy.

; and furnish what Is needed all the way
i through this most Intricate process, ab
! solute accuracy.
From the measuring tanks the saccha
â  rine flood makes its way into the domain
of practical chemistry. ' In thÂ»' first car
; bonation tank it is mixed with milk of
1 lime and boiled for the purpose of pre
cipitating the non-saccharine constitu
. ents of the juice. It is then forced into
the great filters, where the lime com
pounds and Imparities are separated from
, th.' juice. Another carbonation, another
â  filtering, and the juice is subjected to aul
: phur:ition in another tank for the purpose
| of extracting the salts.
The saccharine juice being now com
: paratively pure sugar and water, the
next step in the process is its conce-ntra
| tion preparatory to crystallization. This
I was formerly done in open pans, but at
| the Spreckels factory it is done in great
i closed vessels, known technically as
quadruple effect and double effect. These
inclosed pa.ns are furnished internally
with a series of closed pipes fur steam
â¢ heating, the steam from the boiler of the
j first passing by a worm into the pipe of
I the second, and so on until the juice has
I passed through the required number of
; effects. The steam which rises in the
i fourth pan is drawn off by a system of
: condensation, creating a vacuum, which
! acts through the series of effects, evap
i orating the juice and concentrating it at
I a comparatively low temperature.
Through this treatment the juice hav
ing been concentrated to a "thickness"
of 30 Baume, is conducted to the vacuum
; pans, where it is boiled and the crystal
â  lization proper begins. These pans are
i closed globular vessels in which a vac
uum Is created where boiling can be done
at a low temperature, small crystals
i forming and constantly enlarging by ac

MAKES STEEL
OF COMMON IRON
German Mechanic's Val
uable Discovery.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
INDIANAPOLIS, Aug. 31.â Edward
Hardemeyer, a German inventor, who
served his apprenticeship in the Krupp
Gun Factory of Germany, and was aft
erward foreman in one of the depart
ments, has invented a new process for
turning common iron into steel and the
grade he secures is of the finest possible
quality, especially adapted to edged
tools. A party of capitalists at Ko
komo, where Hardemeyer has been
conducting experiments, are backing
him and have formed a corporation
known as the Eureka Manufacturing
Company, and will carry on the process
on a large scale as soon as the neces
sary plant can be built.
The manufactured product, "which is
yet very limited, has been put on the
market and is giving satisfaction.
Knives for planing machines, paper
cutters, carpenter's bits and other
edged tools have been made by the
process and are being used in factories
at Kokomn, in paper mills at Auburn
and in other places in the State. The
process has not been patented, and the
secret is being carefully guarded. Un
der the terms of the corporate agree
ment the formula has been written out
by Hardemeyer and placed in a safe
deposit vault. It is believed the secret
lies in certain chemicals used and in
forging, but nothing is definitely known
but the results, which are said to be
perfect.
SPONOGLE IS STILL OUT.
His Attorney Denies That He Is
Reinstated.
SAN JOSE. Aug. 31.â Dr. J. R. Curnow,
president of the Board of Managers of
Agnews. denies that Dr. Sponogle has
been reinstated. He says that since Dr.
Sponogle secured the writ of injunction
matters simply stand until the hearing on
September 6.
Senator Morehouse, who is Sponogle'a
attorney, makes the same statement. He
| pusrar is returned to the vacuum pans,
treated as before, returned again t" the
centrifugal machines, to come out th^
second product of sugar. less pure than
the first. Similarly a third supply is
yielded from the draining? of the second.
The molasses from the third product is
a highly impure mixture, and up to the
present time no method has been dis
red to pay for the extraction of the
sugar which it contains.
The main building in thf> Spreckels fac
tory, in which this wonderful transmuta
tion is going on, Is only a few inches short
of 6<Xi feet in length. It is
six stories high ar.<i something
more than 100 fo^t wide. It contains
a wilderness of machinery and rr>of?- hun
dreds of employes. To the east Ls the
boiler-house, a building only a little less
gigantic. wherÂ» one cannot hear oneself
think from the roar of flames under the
I boilers. It contains forty-eight waiertube
j boilers of 125 horsepower each, four econ
omizers, two limekilns for the making of
that product into iime, which later is
made into the milk of lime for the treat
ment of the sugar juice, four ff>ed pumps
to furnish the vast water supply, a 10,000-
I ampere electric light plant and every other
| modern accessory to keep moving the
I wheels in the factory proper. Above the
I boiler-house tower the two great smoke
stacks 216 feet into the air.
The machine shop is as long and as high
and nearly as wide as the boiler-house.
j There is an oilhouse fitted with large
! tanks to stnre the crude petroleum used
as fuel under the boilers, for which at
the present market rate the company will
pay out $2000 a day. There is a large 'scale
j house, a reservoir of a capacity to insure
; th^ daily supply to the factory of the
1,300.000 gallons of water necessary for its
operation.
From the foregoing some small idea can
be obtained of the vast enterprise around
i which the little town of Spreckels clus
i ters. with its pretty cottages built for the
w.>rkingmen and rented to them at the
! lowest possible rate. No one thing has
been neglected to carry out the stupend
ous plans of the management, and from
the success with which things moved off
at the start it is safe to assume that the
highest expectations of all will be realized
by the company and the people of Salinas
and Pajaro valleys, who are the most di
i rectly benefited by the operation of the
I great plant. From to-day in this section
I of Monterey dates will be calculated from
I the first turn of the wheel in the Spreckels
I beet sugar factory.

LANGTRY IN
SCENES FROM
HER OWN LIFE
Appears in "The Degener
ates'', in the Haymarket
at London.
SCORES A SUCCESS
Scandals Involving the "Jersey
Lily's" Name Figure in the
New Comedy.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, Aug. 31.â Mrs. Langtry's
appearance at the Haymarket Theater
this evening in Sydney Grundy's new
comedy. "The Degenerates," was a de
cided success. She daringly portrayed
what are generally understood to be
scenes taken from her own life. The
realism of the initial act is so intense,
bringing in as it does the scandals as
sociated with her name, that the unani
mous comment at the close of the per
formance was "It was good, but she
was awfully brave to do it."
Mrs. Langtry acted better than ever
before, seeming to throw herself
thoroughly into the spirit of the
comedy, which bristles with epigrams,
but is occasionally vulgar.
Hugo Gerald de Bathe, her husband,
looked on from a box with the Duke of
Saxe-</oburg and Gotha and Prince
Louis of Battenberg. The Duchess of
Marlborough. many other titled per
sons and a large number of well-known
Americans, including Nat Goodwin,
were in the audience. The Prince of
Wales telegraphed from Marienbad:
My best wishes for a brilliant success.
Booked for a fortnight from to-day.
ALBERT.
Charles Cawley, Mlbs Lily Hanbury
and Miss Lily Grundy were the pick of
the cast, the last named lady being
Mrs Langtry's daughter, who made
her first stage appearance tÂ»-night.
Mr. Grundy's clever dialogue met
with the usual appreciation. It is
probable that "The Degenerates" will
be taken to the United States in the
course of a few months.

JUDGES WOULD
NOT STAND FOR
ANY TRIFLING
Havey Replaced Hol
land Behind Elsie.
There was no end to the sport at Oak
land track yesterdayâ a race for three
year-old trotters, a mixed affnir for all
sorts of gaited horses to be driven by
member? of the Golden Gate Park Asso
ciation, a second edition of the Bame ex
cept that it called for 2:20 class animals,
and throe running events. Little wonder
Is it, then, that the trowel started for
home, later to dream of horses that
never made a. "jimmy," gentlemen drivers
that always backed their own horse,
bookmakers that "Dutch" their odds and
j,M-k. ys that never pull. In the harness
events Miss Barnabee and King Cadenza,
Doth favorites, came through. For the
2:30 Class, won by Elsie, it was hard to
tell which entry was the actual favorite,
though Steve s at first enjoyed the call.
Bunello, Oraibee and Novia in the run
ning events were all first choices.
There was undoubtedly "more doing"
ow-r the final result of the 2:?,>) class trot,
eventually captured by Elsie, than any
of the other numbers. At l.^st, such
was suspected by the Judges. As a rule
â  1 men driver;-, with no regard for the
;. lings of the down-trodden and unfor
tunate bookie, like to break up heats.
Steve S rated favorite for the tirst heat,
but apparently needed his corns pared,
i for he finished third, Billy M-Kinley, a
2 to 1 chance, getting the verdict over
Elsie in 2:26%.
Before the second heat Dick ITavey ro
ed J. Holland behind Elsie. The real
thi!!^. however, this trip seemed t<> be
Lady Falrose, who after finishing fourth
in the preceding beat, was backed from
threes Mown to 7 to f>. Billy MoKinley
ruled favorite. It was only a Cakewalk
fur I-ia'ly Falrose, thf mare beating out
Elsie with ease in 2:24. By the looks of
the third heat Lady Falrose had evident
ly shot her bolt, for Klsie easily disposed
of General Smith and Bteve S at the wire.
Billy Jonathan was now substituted
behind Lady Falrose, but she seemed
fagged out and had the red bunting
Sashed in her face. It was new easy
for Elsie, who won the h^at and race in
imposing Style from Billy MoKinley. For
his vÂ«>rv capable handling of the winner,
the judges awarded Driver Havey 50 per
Â nt of first money.
Th<- purse for three-year-old trotters
went to Misa Barnabee. the favorite
driven by Durfeeâ after three desperately
contested heats. In the first Lena A came
with b rush, and the first choice stag
gered pasl the wire, only a head in front,
in 2:29. in the second heat Miss Barna
bee tired the last quarter and was led
out by both Corona and Lena A, the
former, handled by Webster, winning by
half a length.
The betting now changed, with Corona,
a I to . r > favorite. The Direct filly tvas
very unsteady in this, the third heat.
breaking on five different occasions, but
finally beating Miss Barnabee by a head.
For her repeated breaks the judges set
the winner back, giving Miss Barnabee
the heal and race. The officials probably
overlooked the fad thai Relnsman l>ur
fue tO"ii up the whole stretch, an offense
that w"uH have ruled him out of the ]
m tracks.
!'â¢â <: :::-'"> class for trotters and pacers
was taken in ragtime by King Cadenza,
which horse, BUperbly driven by H. 11.,
Diinlap. disposed of his tie]d in two !
straight heats. There was much tiresome !

Frank O'Kane, the handsome young
blonde horseman with the sealorown
freckles, lmiml himself in a perilous pre

one "f the reins parted, nnd Frank was !
compelled to take to the horse's back. ;
He performed the feat with the ease and !
grace of a circus performer, and grabbing
the checkreln, pulled the horse up with ,

TOMMY RYAN IS
GIVEN THE DECISION
DTJBUQTE, lowa, Aug. 31.â Tommy-
Ryan was given the decision over Jack
Moffatt at the end of a twenty-round bout
here to-night. Ryan had his opponent go
ing in the thirteenth round and could have
easily put him out. He let down, how
ever, and made no attempt to end the
tight. Ryan did not show a mark, while
Moffatt's nose and mouth bled freely and
his breast and neck were skinned from the
constant jabbing he received. The 6000
spectators were disgusted because Ryan
did not extend himself. Up to the thir
teenth round the men pave, a pretty exhi
bition and Ryan had all the better of it.

The big transport docked a little after
6 o'clock yesterday morning, and {as Boon
as she was made fast the men were
formed In line on the dock. There was
a wait until the Governors of the vari
ous States represented could pet down
to the wharf, and then there was another
delay lor horses for the officers. The
Presidio has horses enough, but now that
the cavalry has been sent away there
was not horse furniture for the number
of officers and State dignitaries who
wished to parade mountea or who were
emitted to tnat distinction.
ihe escort provided was the usual one
of Lnited States troopsâ a battalion, in
ciuai:.- a llgnt battery, ot the Third
Artillery unuer command of Captain
Pratt, and the First California volun
teers. The escort was in line before S
o'clock, but tnere was a delay until 9
betore the column started. Once it
turned into >iarKet street, however, it
moved rapidly, ana oy noon the men were
in camp. Lp Market street the newly I
arn\cu volu.ite^is were gieetea lustuy
and the crowds turned out in force. On
Van .Ness avenue another ovation await
ed them, and wnere the commanding offi
cers turned asiue to review them, on the
corner of Bush and Van Ness, the streets
were impassable.
On arriving at the Presidio the Cali
fornia regiment sent over an invitation
to the men ot the North Dakota and
Idaho regiments to take dinner, while the
camornik Heavy Artillery looked out tor
tne nve companies from Wyoming. Tne
Laggage of tne tnr^e commanao com

ueneral Shafter invited the Governors
of the three States to lunch with him at
his residence at fort Mason after the pa
rade yesterday. Later he drove them
through the reservation and out to the \
lortincations above old Fort Scott.
'me worn of mustering out the men of
the California commands Is progressing
rapidly. a little more latitude was al
lowed the men from here, so there is small
chance that the work will not be done in
time. They have until September 21, which
is tnree weeks from to-aay, and they have
already started on the worK. Three weeks
has been the time allowed the other regi- i
nitnts. so the California men have been
allowed the last week for receiving and
being received*
Captain .Denis Geary, commanding Bat
tery A of the California Heavy Artillery,
has been given permission from the Be re
tary of \\ar to recruit a regiment here.
Captain Geary had hardly Landed irom the
Sherman when he wired East for author
ity to form a regiment, a,nd he has re
ceived the answer that he may go ahead if
the Governor of the State w... not object.
Captain ueary says he already has five
men wno have agreed to raise a company
tacn, and he is sure he will have no trou
ble in rinding the others. All officers must
be men wno have served in the last war;
that is a restriction placed upon the ap
pointment of ofh<-ers by the President, but
there are a good many who will wish to go
liacK to the Islands, and there are many
w no were in service and who did not leave |
tms Mate and so win be glad of an op
portunity to go to the war. Captain
deary is now awaiting the Governor's.re
piy to his request In oraer that he may
notify the Secretary of War.
i tiere win oe d i more promotions In
the heavy artillery. -Major Kice, wno is
on tne retired list of tne regular army,
intended to resign Dtfore his command
had been mustered out and in that way
tive place to Captain Denis Geary of Bat
tery A who would be made major, and
to First Lieutenant John Rosier, wno
would take Captain Geary's place in com
mand of Battery a "Both well deserved
promotions," was the way Major Kice put
it when he communicated with Washing
ton about It. The answer was, however,
that his resignation would do no good, for
the battalion of artillery has dwindled
down to two batteries, the other two
having been .-â â â â  out some time ago,
so if Major Rice resigned no other major
would be appointed. The major will
therefore remain until the mustering out,
but he has expressed in a way better than
words his appreciation of the services of
Adjutant Koster and Captain Geary.
\epterday Companies A. B and C of the
First California were examined physically,
and to-day the examination will be con
tinued through Companies D, E and F.
The heavy artillery will give up all its
.arms and ordnance to-day. Yesterday for
the artillerymen was made notable by the
paymaster. He came and left a month's
pay with each man Th- men of the First
California will have a turn in a few days.
First Lieutenant Ralph A. Clay of the
Fourteenth United States Infantry died
at the general hospital at the Presidio
Wednesday night. He has been ill for a

IDAHO'S RANKS STIRRED
BY A STATE SCANDAL
The Idaho regiment has a scandal which
Ftr!k< f> clo-se to the core of the high ex
ecutive circles of the State. Its central
figure is Captain George E. Steunenburg
Â« f Cotnpany E. and a brother of his Excel
lency Governor Steunenburg.
Twice during the regimenfs stay at
Manila Captain Steunenburg suffered mil
itary disgrace, and when the Idaho tronps
wore about to leave the Philippines he yet
had a sentence of three months hanging

over his head, which was commuted just
before the troops embarked on the tl
port Grant.
Captain Steunenburg's cas< is perhaps
the most peculiar of all the military scan
dals that have thus tar bi i ight to
light.
When the Idaho regiment was first mus
tered into the Bervlce of the Government
Governor St^uner.burg appointed his
brother to tfv- ; s< â  >nd lieuten
ant of < 'ompany A.
In this < apacity Bteunenburg remained
until -the regiment r< ached Manila. Fr c
tion between l.> itei - â  enburg and
other officers then developed, and for a
time the feeling was tensely hitter.
Matters reached a crisis, and Lieutenant
Steunenburg was threatened, so it H
with a court-martial for having made
certain strictun-s on the colonel
and other officers of the regl-
I ment. The burden of the com
; plaints were that Linutenaru Steunei
: talked too much and too freely about
i er people. On one occasion it is said that
I the hasty lieutenant uttered sentiments
i that were both ungentlemanly and unpa
: triotic.
For these offÃr.scs the officers of the
regiment threatened the lieutenant with
:rt-martial. and rather than stand
trial he was allowed to resipn. Upon re
signing his commission as second lieu
tenant Steunenburp came back home.
Perhaps if he had remained there no
further misfortunes would have befallen
him Vacancies in the regiment wer<
â  currtng constantly, and when th<
talncy of Company E became vacant Gov
ernor Steunenburg immediately app
his brother to fill the place. As a matter
of courtesy the Government allowed the
rnor of Idaho to fill vacancies occur
ring in thp ranks of the â¢ii! t .>'-rs of the
repiment. and he grasped th'^ opportunity
of again placing his brother in the army.
Captain Steunenburg immediately went
back to Manila to assun >f his
company, but on arriving there the
charges which had beer, quashed by rea

wen brought against him.

Tht- following is a copy of the r.-port of
I Chairman de Young:
As chairman of the finance committee I desire
to submit to ynu the following report:
At your request 1 assumed the difficult task
of raising the necessary funds to defray the
expenses of welcoming our volunteers. Know
ing full well that 1 was handicapped at the
outset by the short time in which this must be
accomplished, but having every confidence in
the patriotism and public spirit of our citi
zen's, especially in connection with the object
for which the money -.v.!.- to be raised. I felt a
reasonable amount of assurance that our solici
tations would be met by a ready response. The
i<ifult has proven the correctness of my views.
The people have responded liberally. The can
vasa covered a wider ranire than is usually
taken for the purpc?e of raising funds. The
entire 'work and result has been actually ac
complished between August 9 and August 23â
fourteen days, Including Sundaysâ a remark
ably short time to accomplish such wonderful
results.
As you are awarr. the first meeting of citl
zena was called to organize a finance commit
tee on August 5. At that meeting an executive
council was appointed, consisting of M. H. de
Tc.inp (chairman). Hon. Julius Knhn. A. H.
Vail. Charles L.. Patton. Orove P. Ayres, Hon.
J. P. Jackson. Henry P. Snnntag. Hon. Paris
Kilburn. A. J. Rale C. B. Stone and George
H. Pippy (secretary). These gentlemen have
seconded every effort of mine an.l have de
vote.j much time and enemy to the work; nnt
only meeting every day for Joint action and
work, but personally soliciting and acting on
sub-onmrr.itteep. There were appointed four
hundred and seventy of our citizens on the sub
eommlttees. Of that number two hundred and
sixty did active and persistent work, forming
among themselves ninety separate enmmittees.
The amount collected has exceeded all expecta
tions and has enabled your committee to carry
out all its plans in the past and those contem
plated In the ' ire.
I am m ire than gratified to say that the
generosity nf our people has been more than
recompensed â >â  the pecuniary results to our
various mercantile concerns. During the three

CHAPLAIN WALTER G. ISAACS.
Chaplain Walter G. Isp.acs of the fnited
States battleship Massachusetts, who par
ticipated ir. th>> engagci at with Schley's
flying squadron, v.' rtrayed the
Li â¢â¢ of Santiago, the greatest of all
naval battles, last nighi in the Young
Mfn's Christian As tion Auditorium.
Tl â¢ description of the mai . tight
was not only Interesting but exceedingly
Thrilling, and thi I nof a large au
dience was held foi over an hour.
In a very era] Chaplain Isaacs
described the gar:-., ring ..f the war
ships and the search after Cervera.
He recounted several incidents of the
bombardment of E - ted that
Sailor Taylor Evans was the first ts be
hold the Cristobal Colon when the Amer
ican battleships came upon the" Spanish
floet. The sinking of the Merrimac and
the closing chapters of the d< struction and
capture of the en< tny's ships was told in
a forceful anil eloquent way.
Chaplain Isaacs is of Southern birth,
and was appointed by President Cleveland
in ISSS. He served during the whole war.
and was present during every bombard
ment of Santiago and at the fall of Guan

than $1,500,000 among our tradespeople. In
addition to the pecuniary benefit, it has been
a great advertisement throughout the Union of
our State and city, also creating a good feeling
of the country toward the city.
Another feature of the celebration was the
stimulus given to its sentiment of patriotism
among all classes of our people. All nationali
ties seem to have .taken part and extended their
contributions. Even our Chinese merchants put
their hands in th.Mr pockets and helped swell
our fund by over SSOOO. Our theatrical manag
ers, the Harbor Commissioners and the soldiers'
Samaritan. Mrs. Townsend. largely added by
their contributions an i assistance.
The total number of subscriptions entered on
our cashbook to date is 2657. Many of these
entries are lump sums from a largr number of
contributors. After a careful examination of
estimates and funds the actual number of in
dividual subscribers amounts to 6020. This will
give your committee some idea of the scope of
the work carried out by the executive council
of the finance committee. Never was any
fund accumulated from so many individual sub
scriptions in the history of the city. The entire
amount raised was given in sums of less than
$100 with the exception of about 2' â 'â¢ subscrip
tions. The above comments do not include the
money!" received from theatrical benefits, con
cert* and naval aarade.
Hoping the foregoing ceneral statement of
the finance committee will meet with your ap
proval. I conclude by stating that the full
amount collected up to date and deposited with
your treasurer. F. W. Dohrmann. Is KS.S64 ST.
CHAPLAIN HIT TWICE
BY FLYING BULLETS
The Rev. Father W. D. McKinnon,
chaplain of the First California Regi
ment. Is a modest hero of two thrilling
and hairbreadth escapes from Filipino
bullets. Father McKinnon was wounded
twice during the campaign of hardships

coming Crowds
to Presidio*
scarcely anybody but a few officers of the
regiment knew anything about it.
The Rev. Father McKinnon's wounds
were Blight, but he received and bore
them like a hero and he stayed right in
the same place till he performed hi? du
ties, though bullets whizzed past him by
the score.
On the night of February 15, when
Lieutenant Charlie Hogan nf gallant
Company M fell wounded. Father Mc-
Kinnon rushed into the thickest of the
fight unarmed and carried Lieutenant
Hogan t'i a place of safety. Father Me-
Kinnon did more than this. He knelt be
side the prostrate body of the wounded
lieutenant while bullets flew thick and
fast to str.p the blood which flowed from ,
a ghastly wound in the breast. While he
was Btocplng over 'Lieutenant Hopan a
bullet plowed its way across the fieshey
part of Father McKinnon's hand.
'â¢That's pretty dose, father. ' said Cor
poral Jack Miller, who was assisting the
chaplain to ease Lieutenant Hogan's suf
fering.
"Lift him pemly. boys." said Father
McKinnon to Corporal Miller and Private'
Jones as they put their arms around ilii
gan to carry him to a place of temporary
safety.
Across a dangerous stretch of open ter
ritory, where flying bullets whizzed
through the air, Father McKinnon and
his assistants bore Hogan to a sheltered
spot. When the- excitement was fiver Cap
tain Tom O'Niel of Company M advised
Father McKinnon to go to the hospital
and have his wound dressed. He thought
'that the hospital corps had enough *.o at
tend to to cafe for the men who were
dangerously wounded, so Father McKin
non went to his tent and dressed his own
wound.
In th* advance on Malate Father Mc-
Kinnon was shot in the groin. The wound
was very slight and his same reticent
bearing kept him from the hospital and,
hfs name from the dread list of the day's
casualties again. In every battle in which
the California regiment figured Father
McKinnon was out on the firing line. He :
i was a:- brave as a lion and he set an ex- :
ample for the men. Every time there was
a hot skirmish it was two to one Father
McKiimop was close on the heels of the
farthest man out. All the officers of the
regiment are loud in their praises of
Father McKinnon.
"There was no spot too hot for Father
McKinnon," said Captain O'Niel yester
day in speaking of Father McKinnon's
bravery. â¢'}!â¢ is honored and respected
by every man in the regiment, regardless
of cre< (1.
"Wherever there was a spiritual duty
to perform you'd find Father M< K'^non
on the spot and a little thing like v volley
of Filipino bullets didn't s<-are him worth
a cent. He went' right out on the firing
] line with the boys and he stayed there ;
! until the fighting was over. That's the i
kind of a chaplain the California boys
had in the Philippines."
HOW A REGIMENT IS
FED ON THE TRANSPORTS
The transport Grant docked at the Gov
ernment wharf early yesterday morning,
tew hours later all the soldiers were
ashore. The steamer is to be sent back
to Manila a? speedily as possible, so to
,'ay ?he will go to Hunter? Point drydock
and on Monday she will be back at the
wharf petting ready for another voyage.
The amount of stores required by one
of these vessels for a round trip is some
thing enormous. Take the provisions tor
ay used Â«'n the Grant for instance. J
On Sunday last the soldiers had fur bre-ik
urry of salmon and rice, bread and ;
coffee. For dinner they had braised beef.
stewed tomatoes, potatoes, plum pudding
and- sauce and coffee. For supper they
stewed apples, rice and tea. To get
these nvals ready required 10 cases ;
salmon. 15 cases tomatoes, 10 cases pota
toes, IS bags flour, 300 pounds rice, 23
pounds raisins, 100 pounds
ftgs, 10 pounds baking powder; 500 pounds
sugar, -'"i pounds apples, 10 pounds tea.
unds i offee, 5 pounds curry powders,
5 pounds corn Btarch, one gallon wine, 10M :
da fresh beef.
The above was for the soldiers alone.
The officers had for breakfast watermelon, ;
oatmeal and cream, brdtled siriu;n steak,;
broiled spring chicken and bacon, cream
toast Saratoga chips, plain boiled pota-
Parker S .-â¢ rolls, doughnuts, choc
olate . :â¢'! coffee. For dinner the officers,
had mulligatawny soup, broiled mack.:-;,
b ked ham, tripe a la creole. thick-n
a la Boheme, spaghetti, prime sir
loin of beel, chicken with jelly, masned i
plain boiled potatoes, peach tapioca pud
plain boiled potatoes, peach apioca pud
ding and win- Bauce, punch a la cardinal,
assorted cakes, crackers and cheese and
coffee. Chief Steward W. Herbert is the
only one of the crew left who came ar iund
the Horn in the Grant, and judging by his
r , . Â; - .| he is not likely to leave the vessel
for a long time to come, unless of his own
volitloh. The quarters under his care are
as clean aa a new pin. and the bills of
fare speak tor themselves.
The transport Warren is loaded and
ready for sea. She will probably get away
to-day. The work of fitting out the Co
lumbiais progressing rapidly, and the Cen
tennial will be ready for horses next
week The Sherman was taken to the roll
ing mills- yesterday, as some repairs are to
be made on her by the Union Iron Works.
The Hancock will be practically a new
Â«hip wh'-n the repairs and alterations now
going on are all made. A new hurricane
Seek has been put on her and a lot of
cabins and sutcMoms are being adaed.
The engines art being thoroughly over
hauled and in all about $300,000 will be
snent on the vessel before she goes into
service again. The Aztec is being got
ready for her cargo of horses, and the
Sikh' is having extra passenger accommo
dation* built on her main deck. Ine
steamer Victoria is now on h*r way here
'from Pusret '.Sound, and as soon as sne
arrives will be fitted out for a transport
The navy transport Solace Balled from
Manila for Baa Francisco on August 24.
She ha-= a groat number of naval ofnccis
and a lot of discharged men aboard.
Dewey is to be properly remembered in
Mnntnt-lier Vt . when he arrives in New
v Â-k Two of the cannon that he cap
tured from the Spanish warship Castelia
were sent overland last night, and on
their arrival at Montpeher they will be
mounted and got ready to fire as soon as
Dewey'a arrival is announced. Montpelier
is Admiral Dewey's birthplace, and his
townsmen want to celebrate his return, so
they sent a request to the Secretary of tne
Navy and he placed the cannon at their
dlsnosal They were brought here from
Manila and have been at the navy yard
for some time. Yesterday they were
brought down on the steamer Herald and
were shipped East. One of them weighs
nd the other 10.770 pounds.
SLADE BENEFIT HAS
BEEN POSTPONED A DAY
Owing to the fact that the Native Sons'
and Daughters" banquet to the First Cal- ;
ifornia volunteers is to take piace on Sat
urday night the big be-netit to Private
John A Slade of the same regiment, who
lost a leg in battle during the war in the
Philippines, which was scheduled for the
same night at the Alhambra Theater, has |
b^-en postponed until the following even
ing. The change in the date was made at ;
the request of hundreds of volunteers who
have purchased tickets for the benefit ct
their crippled comrade, whom they regard
as the real hero of the regiment. Ihey
will alll be there, as will the officers of the
First California, who have engaged a box !
for the occasion. Major Phelan yester
day sent a check for $25 to those having
charge of the benefit fund, and also
agreed to attend and make the presenta- |
tion speech. The entertainment will surely ,
take place Sunday night, and from present
indications those who witness it will be
amply repaid, as a programme of excep
tional excellence has been prepared.

QUARTERMASTER BAKER
TO BE DISCIPLINED
KEFTJSED TO ALLOW INSPECT
ORS ON THE GRANT.
Quartermaster Baker, commanding the
Government' transport Grant, has got into
trouble with the customs authorities for
violating section 3068 of the Revised
Statutes of the United States. Customs
Surveyor Spear reported Wednesday to
Customs Collector Jackson that Baker
had refused to allow the customs search
ers to board the transport last Tuesday
night, ami that the Surveyor had been
obllg'.-d to take the tug Golden Gate yes
terday forenoon and had placed his men
on bo.ird the transport, notwithstanding
the protest of Quartermaster Baker.
Section 3068 reads as follows:
"If any master of a vessel coming into
or having arrived at any port within the
United States, shall obstruct or hinder,
or shall Intentionally cause any obstruc
tion or hindrance to any officer in law
fully feeing aboard Bucfa vessel for the
purpose of carrying into effect any of
the revenue lav. s of the United States,
he shall for every such offense be linbi<
to a penalty of not more than i'f'jO nor less
than $5 â ."
On a previous occ&sii n when the Grant
was in port Quartermaster Baker com
plained that the customs officers had
turned the ship topsy turvey and that
many articles of value were missing after
they had completed their work of search
ing the vessel for smuggieii articles. The
facts on both sides were laid before the
Secretary of th Treasury and he sus
tained the customs officers and repudiated
the quartermaster's assumption that the
customs men had no right to board a
United States transport.
The customs peopn si â¢ m determined to
push Quartermaster Baker to the wall

A CHANGE IN THE RULES.
OX the meeting of Congress an effort will be
made to bring about a revision of the rules
under which the House of Representatives
work, and change the Speaker's position from
â  the leader of the majority of the House to
.in impartial chairman presiding over the de-
The movement for revision is in no sense a par
ne, nor does it spring from any desire to haa
the coming Speaker in the performance of his
< >n the contrary, it is stated by the Washing
ton con nt of the New York Mail and Ex
press that General Henderson, who is now virtually
I of the Speakership, will give the plan his ap-
The merit of the proposed change will be apparent
to any one who gives the subject consideration. The
number of bills and resolutions introduced into Con
gress at each session runs up into thousands. If Con
gress undertook to attend to all of them it would not
be possible to do more than read them and vote upon
them. There would be no time for anything else. It
is imperative that some committee take general charge
of the business of the House and determine what
measures shall and what shall not have a hearing on
the floor. That work has been performed in the House
of Representatives by the Committee on Rules, of
which the Speaker was chairman, and in consequence
of his double office the Speaker has been necessarily
a partisan official deciding as a member of the Rules
Committee what bills should have the right of way,
and then as Speaker guiding them through the House
Under the British parliamentary system the man
agement of business and the determination as to what
measures shall occupy the House is in the hands of
the Ministry. The Speaker, having nothing to do
with that part of the proceedings of Parliament, acts
impartially in presiding over the debates when the
various bills are brought forward. The proposed re
vision of the rules of Congress will introduce some
thing like the British system into our own practice.
In place of the Committee on Rules, of which the
Speaker is chairman, there will be substituted a com
mittee of seven members, to be chosen by the ma
jority of the House. This committee, to which the
Speaker will not be eligible, will be composed wholly
of members of the majority party and will have charge
of all the btisiness of the session.
Under the new system there- will be a notable
rhange in the rule relating to the recognition of mem
bers claimin; the Moor. According to the practice of
late the Speaker has exercised the ri^ht of recogniz
ing whom he chose and refusing the floor to whom
he chose. The new plan will requite the Speaker to
recognize the member who first rises. lie will have
no arbitrary option in the matter, and will therefore
b<: a chairman merely, and not a "czar."
It is claimed by the advocates of the reform that
it will be but a return to the original parliamentary
practice of the country, snd that the effect will be to
enable a majority of the House to control the pro
rredings of the body, without depending upon the in
dividual will of the Speaker, and to insure to every
member the right to be heard. It is expected, more
over, to prevent the pigeonholing of measures which
nave the support of a majority, but which are opposed
by the Speaker, and. in short, once more make the
House of Representatives a self-governing body.
Captain Carter, who was convicted by a military
court of pulling down something like $2,000,000 in
harbor work contracts, is so sure he did not have a
'air trial he has about concluded to pose as an Amen
:an Dreyfus and appeal to the whoie world for sym
pathy.
There is a feeling among a considerable number
of Cubans that it would be a good thing to send
'jomez to San Domingo and let him run for Presi
ient over there.
The municipal conventions started early, but at the
rate they are progressing it is not likely they will get
â heir work done prematurely.
BRYAN ON TRUSTS.
COLONEL BRYAN has made some speeches
already during his trip hither and his lew hours
in California. To free silver and 16 to i he
: sticketh closer than a brother. He also slightly dish
waters the anti- imperial issue, but leaves it no better
than he found it, as put by Hoar. Edmunds, Bour
well-ex-President Harrison and o^ier Republican
loaders. Alter siiver his strong suit is a vivid horror
jof the trusts. That issue is to his liking, and he can
paint a trust in colors more diabolic than any other
artist who is now ascending the step-ladder toward
office, with brush and pot in hand, daubing and yell-
I ing as he rises.
The whole country is apprehensive about the trusts.
Their sudden rise, the appalling volume of their cap
, italization, the number of occupations they have ob
{ sole.cd. present exactly the series of problems which
C with the introduction of labor-aiding machin-
Mechanical devices took manual labor from the
luursn hand and left it. for the time, empty of bread.
ere is no substantial disagreement about trusts.
Their economic effect, their use of the power of con
centration, their legal immortality by endowment
with perpetual succession, disquiet the people and in
j duce forebodings as to the future which furnish the
politician's opportunity. Colonel Bryan comprehends
al! this and occupies himself calling, public attention
i to the abhorrent features of the evil, but dextrously
avoids committing himself to a remedy, beyond his
own election to the Presidency, which he regards as
' a political panacea of the highest merit. Occasion
ally, however, he has dropped diagnosis for prescrip
tion and has hinted at a cure, but has not abided by |
' any remedy in the materia politica. When he was in |
Dcs Moines last month dictating the nomination for
Governor he snubbed the trust and put silver forward
on all four feet. There he said: "The trust question ;
is a great question, but we cannot make peace with
! the money trust in order t6 attack a toothpick trust."
In another of his three speeches in Dcs Moines he \
: -aid: "It has been claimed that the States should j
extinguish the trusts. They won't do so as long as the
States are bidding for the dishonor of being the
spawning-ground of the trusts. The Federal Govern- |
; nient alone can extinguish the trusts, because it alone
can lay its hands upon the States and compel them '
to enforce the law."
This is 1 a novel view of the relation of the Federal
Government to the States. States enforce their own |
'. laws, and the Federal machinery is provided for en
forcemenl of acts of Congress. Does Colonel Bryan
mean that when the States pass anti-trust statutes j
the Federal Government can lay hauls on the State
machinery and compel their enforcement? If so, the
Federal control of trusts is limited to the States which
choose to pass such laws, unless, indeed, the power
! to lay Federal hands on the States implies also the
power to compel the States to pass such laws as arc
I needed for that exercise of Federal jurisdiction. Or
did he mean that Federal anti-trust laws are to be
] enforced under Federal compulsion by the States in
the absence of State statutes on that subject?
If he mean that Congress can compel the enforce
ment by State machinery of Federal anti-trust laws he
probably has in mind the fugitive slave law of 1793 '
! and 1850, held to be constitutional by the Supreme
I Court in the Dred Scott decision. But that law
rested upon an express grain of power covering that
subject in the Federal constitution. Article IV. sec- :
I tion 3, of the constitution says: "No person held to
\ service or labor in one State under the laws thereof
i escaping into another shall in consequence of any
law or regulation therein be discharged from such
i service or labor, but shall be delivered up on claim of
! the party to whom such service or labor may be due."
In Prigg vs. Pennsylvania it was early decided that
the constitution confers on Congress an exclusive
fiower to legislate concerning fugitive slaves. The
law, passed under that exclusive grant of power, com
pelled cognizance by local judicial officers and em
; powered Federal Marshals to call out the posse
comitatus in its enforcement.
Therefore to make his theory stick Colonel Bryan
mus*. find in the constitution an exclusive power to
legislate against trusts. Where is it? If in the
authority to regulate commerce between the States,
where is the line to be drawn between corporations?
What maximum of capitalization shall determine it?
It will be seen at once that this suggestion of a
remedy adumbrates the question with more difficul- i
ties than exist at present. In his speech in the
Auditorium in Chicago Colonel Bryan said a Dem
ocratic President could appoint an Attorney General
who would recommend the necessary amendments to
' the Federal constitution to enable legislation against
! the trusts. This is an admission that there is a con
; stitutional lack, and, if so, what becomes of his attack
l on the Republicans for not exerting a power which
he confesses has no constitutional existence?
In one of his al fresco speeches in Nevada this week
1 he made another proposition to the effect that tru=t>
should be compelled to pay for a Federal license to
do business. A license is a form of taxation. The
constitution describes accurately the forms tinder
which Congress may levy taxes. Perhaps Mr. Bryan j
can, explain to which of these he will assign his trust
license tax.

A DEPARTMENT STORE TRUST.
W'JIEN the great department stores with their
immense capital and a vast variety of goods for
sale under one roof first made their power
felt in the retail trade there naturally arose a consid
erable antagonism on the part of the smaller dealers.
Later on the larger of such stores began to deal di
rectly with manufacturers, and then the wholesale men
and jobbers felt the pinch and joined the protestr Now
comes a report from New York of a still further de
velopment of the big stores that may in the end hurt
the manufacturers themselves.
The new departure is the organization of a vast
trust to include all the department stores of the
United States. The movement is under the direction
of a corporation known as the Mercantile Reorgani
zation Company. According to a report in the New
York Post the plans of this department store trust
include a capitalization of $50,000,000, half in common
and half in preferred stock. An offer for underwrit
ing this stock has already been made by a large bank
ing house of that city. The owners of department
stores are to remain as resident managers, and are to
receive stock in the trust in payment for their stores;
but the buying is to be done abroad by the trust's
buyers and in American markets in very large lots.
Wherever practicable, the entire production of a mill
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 1, 1399.
is to be purchased, and. when necessary, manufactur
ing plants, to be run by the trust, will be built or
leased. The gain to the concern will be in cheap buy
ing and a reduction of expenses in keeping stocks up
to date.
The scheme has not yet been worked out. It ap
pears there is a good deal of opposition to it on the
part of the larger proprietors, who are reported by
the Post as saying that, individually, they would pre
fer to run their own business. While admitting that
much could be saved to the smaller department stores,
which are at present unable to purchase entire mill
productions, they thought that the plan would cause
a general similarity in stocks, and an undesirable
absence of the many specialties used by department
store owners to draw trade.
It the plan of the company be carried out a long
.step will have been taken toward getting rid of the
middlemen in all branches of trade in products
handled by the big stores. Something very much like
Bellamy's system of economical handling of business
will have been accomplished, but it is not likely there
would be any real benefit flowing from it for the great
mass of consumers.
Hardly had the Lick telescope established a repu
tation as the largest in the world when the University
; of Chicago set to work and obtained a larger one,
! and now Harvard purposes to surpass that. Evidently
the universities of the country are going to be known
: as the most farsighted in the world.
Now, as for John R. McLean of Cincinnati, Demo
j cratic nominee for - Governor of Ohio, it is safe to
! say the good old Thurman' Democrats won't do a
; thing to him.
JOHX R. McLEAN of Cincinnati has at last
attained the Democratic nomination for Gov
ernor of Ohio and thereby attested his suprem
acy in the party. It remains to be seen what the vic
tory will bring him, and the prospect is not promising
to his hopes. Democracy has been known before
this to profit by Republican years for the purpose of
nominating men in its own ranks whom it wished to
slaughter, and it is likely that among the men who
are best satisfied in Ohio just now are the Demo
crats whom McLean has betrayed in times past and
who have long waited for a chance to knife him.
During the last twenty, years there has been hardly
an able Democratic leader in Ohio who has not been
made the victim of the personal jealousy or antag
onism of McLean. The men who remember his
treatment of Thurman and of Pendleton, and who
have any respect for the memory of those favorite
sons of Ohio Democracy, can hardly be expected to
support him with any fervor, if, indeed, they support
him at all. It is not improbable, indeed, that the
friends of those men, as well as the friends of Cleve
land, will mete out to McLean in the course of the
campaign the sort of treatment which he pave to other
Democrats when they were the nominees of the party.
The platform and the candidate present one of
those spectacles of inconsistency with which later-day
Democracy appears enamored. The platform ap
peals to the masses against capitalists, and the nom
inee is one of the most aggressive millionaires of the
time, and one whose millions have been most cor
ruptly eafned. That he will expend them freely in
the campaign is perhaps the chief cause of his nomi
nation, but the earnest old farmers of Populistic ten
dencies who really believe the corruptions of the rich
are ruining the country will not take kindly to a mil
lionaire candidate nor find any satisfaction in voting
alongside the corrupt elements whom his money can
buy.
Outside the nomination of McLean the most no
table feature of the work of the convention is the out
spoken declarations in favor of free silver and Bryan
in the platform. The first plank declares: "We
heartily reaffirm the entire Chicago platform of 1896,
and we especially emphasize the financial plank
therein, and we continue to demand the free and un
limited coinage of silver and gold as equal in primary
money at the rate of 16 to 1, independent of all other
nations in the world." The second plank is equally
unequivocal and even more terse: "Honorable Wil
liam T. Bryan retains our confidence and we demand
his renominatiorj in 1000."
The rest of the platform is made up mainly of
platitudes concerning trusts, imperialism, extrava
gance, corruption, subserviency to Great Britain and
subserviency to political bossesâ all of which are of
course in due form charged upon the Republican
party. With those planks in the platform the voters
will have little to do. The real issues are to be Bry
anism in national politics, and in State politics the per
sonality of John R. McLean. Ohio sometimes goes
Democratic in off years, but such a thing is not likely
to happen this time. Unless machine politics and the
corrupting influence of money have more power in
Ohio than in any other part of the Union, the con
test is going to be a walkover for the Republicans or
something very much like it.
CRIMINAL APPEAL IN GREAT BRITAIN
ybot the ejects of the Dreyfus case has been
[J a renewal "of the agitation for the establish
ment of a court of criminal appeal in Great
Britain. A change in the present law, which permits
of no appeal from criminal convictions except to the
clemency of the Home Secretary acting for the
sovereign, has long been urged, and at one time dur
ing the sensation of the Maybrick case a considerable
support .was given to the proposed, reform. That
agitation soon died out, but now since the revelations
concerning the conviction of Dreyfus show how im
portant it is to the innocent to have the right of
appeal from conviction, the issue has been taken up
anew and this time the reformers may be successful
in their efforts.
The movement does not lack the support of emi
nent lawyers in Great Britain. They argue that the
justesf of Judges and the mo.st impartial and intelli
gent of juries are liable to error. Mistakes of iden
tity, misconstructions of circumstantial evidence, and
other errors to which humanity is liable render it
certain that innocent persons are convicted at times
no matter how great may be the care to give the ac
cused the benefit of every doubt. At present in Great
Britain the presumption is that the court can do no
wrong and when once convicted the accused person
has no recourse except to an appeal for mercy.
Had Dreyfus been convicted in Great Britain he
could not have had the benefit of the rehearing of his
case which has been accorded to him under French
law by decree of the Court of Cassation. It is not
strange that in the N light of the evidence now being
brought "out at Rennes thoughtful Englishmen
should consider seriously whether it would not be
well to provide for -a similar appeal in case there
should ever be a mistake of justice in their own
:ountry.
This may he regarded as the most sanguine year in
our history, for it is said even the Democrats in Torn
Reed's district are hopeful of winning out in the elec
tion to fill the vacancy.

raphy between a lightship nine miles out in the ocean and the Cliff House for
several weeks for the newspaper.
Out of the h;ize this evening came the message, "Sherman sighted." It was
received on a tape register in Morse characters by Mr. Wolters at the Cliff
House, who immediately telephoned the glad tidings to The Call. The transport
will lie off the harbor to-night and sail up to the city in the morning. A tre
mendous welcome awaits the returned soldiers.

Cook of the Cruiser
Newark Taken.
Shanghaiing Is becoming as common on
the water front as it was in the days
when British ship captains wore paying â 
ISO and $100 "blood money" for every
sailor put aboard the ship. Men are
very scarce and In 'consequence coun
trymen and strangers are' being Rustled
aboard outward bound ships on any and.
every pretext, while some are. even
drugged and wake up only to find them
selves on the high seas bound for Liver
pool, Antwerp or Havre.
Thomas Burke, a cook on the United
States ciulser Newark, and James Brown,
a friend of his, woke up yesterday morn
ing nd found themselves aboard- the
British ship Crompton. Burke had been
given shore liberty and at once went and
found his friend Brown. They visited
various resorts on the Barbary Coast and ;
finally wandered down to the water front. .
There they had several drinks with some
strangers, but they remember very little I
else fter that. Some one agreed to take j
them off to the Newark, but instead put
them aboard the Crompton.
When Burke and Brown came to their :
senses and found themselves aboard a ;
British ship they raised a great howl, but i
it did them no good. The advent of the i
first mate soon Quieted them. Luckily
Burke saw the Newark's launch passing
close to the Crompton and be at once
jumped overboard. The men in the
launch saw him jump and the boat was
turned toward him and Burke was picked
up. He explained the circumstances of
the case and the launch went alongside
the Britisher and made a demand for
Brown. He was at once released and the {
launch put him ashore. Burke was taken
back to the cruiser. Both men are thank
ing their lucky stars for their escape.

POISON AND THE ROPE
CLAIM THREE VICTIMS
A Demented Actor
Ends His Troubles.
THREE suicides, two by poison and
one- by hanging, constitute yester
day's record for San Francisco.
the record of the closing day of
a month replete with instances of self
destruction. George Allen Watson, an
actor well known in this city, Oakland
and Sacramento, was found dead in
his room at C 23 O'Farrell street at 11
o'clock yesterday morning, having de
parted hence by the laudanum route.
At about the same hour James Gillick,
a small property owner in the Mission,
was found in his room at 930 Twenty
second street dead from a dose of
"death to rats.; and at about 7 o'clock
last night Henry Neuman, a sawdust
merchant, hanged himself In a barn at
Fifth and Harrison sti
Watson had been acting peculiarly
for some time and had been more or
less under the Influence of liquor ever
since he joined the* Alcazar company
several weeks apo. Last Saturday he
quarreled with his wife, who is an
actress, and then went on a protract

Mrs. Watson departed for Los An

"The Twentieth Century" company
without luddlns: him good-by or in
forminp him of her intention. Tues
day Watson appeared at the O'Farrell
Btreet house in an Intoxicated condi
tion and spoke t<> Mrs. Israel, one of
the lodgers, as he made his way to
his. room. Yesterday morning one nf
the housemaids looked throuph th^
keyhole and saw him lying on tho bed,
fully dressed. Mrs. Mclntyre, the
landlady, was notified and the door
was fo*rced open. Watson was d< ad
and a bottle of "toothache drops," the
principal Ingredient of which was lau
danum, and a half empty glass on the
table near by told the story of suicide.
The man had evidently been dead since
Tuesday ni^ht, for letters addressed
to him which had been shoved under
the door by the servant were un

taken advantage of an opportunttv to
go on the road to give him a chance to

To do honor to M. Pascal of Paris, Herr
Wallot of Germany, John Beecher of Lon
don and Walter Cook of New York, the
four architects who have journeyed to
San Francisco to pass judgment on the
plans submitted for tho new buildings for
the University of California, over ninety
gentlemen, representing the scientific,
j judicial, literary and political life of the
j State, sat down last night to one of the
most elegant banquets ever held in the
j maple room of the Palace Hotel. The
long tables were beautifully decorated
with a profusion of the choicest flowers,
while around the walls of the room, and
: hiding its entrances and exits, was placed
! a fringe of stately palms.
The only laxly present was Mrs. Phebe
A. Hearst, the hostess, to whose lavish
generosity the university is indebted for
the proposed structures on whose beauty
her guests from four nations are to pass.
Seated on one side of her "was Architect
Pascal and on the other Mayor Phelan,
who acted as the toastmaster of the even
ing.
The hotel chef was instructed that h
reputation depended on his work, at this
particular banquet, and the result was
a menu that will be the standard of excel
lence in the city for many a day to come.
As soon as the guests had worn off the
first sharp edge of their appetites Mayor
I Phelan arose and with his accustomed
! fluency of speech and aptness of metaphor
extended a welcome to the strangers who
are bent on a mission which menus so
much 10 the future generations of Califor
nia.
Following the Mayor, M. Pascal spoke
on the object of his visit here and on the
plans of the now buildings. Regent Halli
"die then held forth on the University of
California, and he gave way to Professor
I W K. Jones, President Jordan of Stan
' ford, Senator George C. Perkins. Regent
'â  Reinsteln, Professor I,e Conte and a
number of others, each of whom said
i something pertinent to the matter which
i had brought the guests of honor to this
coast, and complimentary of their work.
and the gracious woman who had made it
possible. , .
At 11 o'clock Mrs. Hearst withdrew
while all stood to toast her and wish her
! a pleasant adieu. The gentlemen re
;ma filed a couple of hours longer over
their cigars and listened to bright
-i chea and clever badinage. Among
those who were present to partake of the
hospitality of Mrs. Hearst were:

A .Fine Fall Trade Promised.
The New York circular of Henry Clews says:
â¢â¢â¢Dunns- the past two months the whole drift
cf affairs) both in finance and trade, has been
toward the maintenance of ah active bull cam
paign during the fall -months. The activity of
our Industries f;ir exceeds anything ever wit
nessed in the rast; lur is there anywhere an
indication of impending overprodetion nor of
any reactionary tendency; and what la still
more important] producers have, now a guar
anty they ne\er bad befure, in the. rapid growth
of their ability to command foreign outlets for
any possible surplus of supply in the home
markets; At the beginning of the summer then
â were'sunie uncertainties* in the situation which
produced a di-gree of hesitancy in the securi
ties market and' made operators the more will
in? to take a breathing spell Hfter several suc
cessive month? ot extraordinary excitement.
Those ..L'Stack-s have now disappeared. The
crops, taking them as a whole, are more than
a Kood average. Our grain market may be ex
pected to receive the stimulus of another sea
son Of .-short crops in other countries; and.
judging from the present u-mper of business on
the Produce Exchange, it seems possible that
while the quantity Ol our exportable surplus of
'ctreals may not fully eÂ«jual that of the last
two seasons, yet their aggregate value may
easily approximate that of either of tii';se years.
So that appearances indicate the probability
<,f a continuance of the remarkable creditor
foreign balances that have marked the fiscal
years I^7-Un and lsi'S-M. Tlie.se are prospects
th>- importance of which it Is not easy to ex
aggerate.
â¢â¢prosperous conditions continue throughout
the land, and the wave advances rather than
recedes, with bright prospects ahead. A
larger number of working men are employed
to-day on terms satisfactory to themselves and
thÂ«-lr employers than ever before in the na
tional history. Discontent is nowhere Justifi
ably to be found. It is true, grievances creep
out occasionally here an.i there, but they are
not of serious consequence. The demand has
fairly caught up to the supply in everything.
There is little belling ahead. The business of
the country is on a k-gitimate basis and devoid
i,f boom, which is the best evidence of its sub
stantial and lasting character. Now that the
crops are assureti and the money sc.ire has
passed over, the impetus to push business
ahead; con be relied upon for the balance of
thi'i year at leastj thereby making it the best
record year ever experienced in business

Chicago Grain Market.
CHICAGO, Aug. 31.â December wheat started
lie below yesterday's last price at 72% c. The
predicted freer movement 'of wheat toward ]
primary Western markets, more especially In !
the Northwest, was being realized to some ex- J
tent. While to-day's receipts were still much j
smaller than those of last year, â  they showed
a steady Increase. Chicago got 157 cars, com- |
pared with ISO the year before, and Minne
appolis and Duluth reported 550 oars. A bear
ish telegram came from Winnipeg declaring
that Manitoba and other British Northwestern |
provinces would show a crop of 50,000.000 bush- j
els of fine wheat. There was no export busi- j
ness here and the longs showed a tendency
to let go of their holdings in the absence of |
encouraging news. The speculative business ;
was small and traders were greatly Inclined i
to await the result of to-morrow's deliveries I
on September contract. September sold trom'
".. < to THic, with Infrequent rallies, and closed I
at the bottom. â¢ .-â¢"
Corn tamely followed the lead of the wheat
market, despite encouraging news regarding
the shipping demand. December lost >4c.
There was little business in the oats mar
ket exclusive of exchanging. December closed
%c: September finished %c lower.
The provision market followed the market
for live hogs. Trices at the yards were 10Â©
20c lower, and hog receipts for the day were
23,000. This, with the weakness in grain, put
provision prices down several notches. Pork
closed 2W(iT>c lower for October and .7'^c for
January. ~ Lard lost 2â c for October and Janu
ary. Ribs were more steady than the rest, and

RIPS UP THE
TWO BOARDS
Charges Them With
Corruption.
PROOF WANTING, HOWEVER
â 
â â â
NEW BOARD OF EDUCATION IS
COMMENDED.
â¦ â
Final Report of the Body Is Sub
mitted to Judge Daingerfield
and the Members Are
Discharged.
â^ â ~_
Next week Presiding Judge Daingerfield
will draw a new Grand Jury, that which
has been investigating the public affairs
since December 2s of last year having
stepped down and out yesterday. Early
in the afternoon the old jury appeared
bofore Judge Dainper:ie!d and filed its
final report. The court thanked the vari
ous members for their good work and
devotion to duty, after which he made the
order dismissing them from further duty.
That the jury was a believer In the Sis
honesty and culpability of the Supervisors
and the late Board of Kdueation is set
forth in plain language in its report,
which was accepted with the thanks of
the court. In part this report reads:
la .-.ubmiiUr.g our final report we would
briefly suggest. a reasonable expectation on the
part of the community as to what a Grand Jury
may accomplish. While extraordinary powers
aro conferred upon !?ucli a body, it is hampered
by considerations often overlooked. A Grand
Jury muft proceed In accordance with law. It
may ri<:t in.lict on general principles, but is
KWora to judicially weigh the evidence offered
or obtainable In any given case and to find an
indictment only when in its judgment the tes
timony is likely to result in conviction. It may
fc-ei fully a*=urei th.it offenses have been com
mitted, but if it cannot obtain proof that
WjuM stand the test of a court of law it ha.
no ritnt to indict, however great may be the
popular clamor. An instance of this is found
in the undoubted culpability of some of the
members cf the last Board of Education. The
jury was convinced ;Â«.si:ions were s.>ld and
tn.it the city was defrauded in many ways, but
its best efforts failed to adduce any evidence
whatever, and It could consequently find no
Indictment;
â¢ There is little doubt that some of the pres
ent Board of Supervisors have been improperly
influenced in the' discharge of their official
duty, but here, too, no proof could be obtained.
In most instances of bribery and corruption
there are no witnesses save the Klver and the
taker, both of whom would deny the transac
tion. To send for books hoping to gain proof
is wholly useless, as such expenditures, if re
corded at all, are carefully covered.
No jury can at one time successfully combat
all the frbusea that beset the municipality. It
may be thankful if it succeeds in a single In
stance. We have by no means accomplished all
we hoped for, but In the matter of the straw
bond outrage we have done something. The
practice is broken up, and with proper care
will net be resumed. The professional bonds
man has been filled with terror, and the Board
â _ â¢
â 
I
.â :ci;'al
iie has
111 be bro'j.
Impressed by the brutality and demoraliza
tion in connection with prize-njthts we have
protested against the further Â£rant:nÂ£ of per
mission for these debasing exhibitions.
Early In our term, wh^n we were actively
searching for evidence that l-ositior.s in the
School Department had been sold, we wore ad
vised by thÂ» District Attorney that the ac
ceptance of a bribe by a school official was by
the prevision of section IST? of the Political
Code a misdemeanor and not a felony, as In
the case of other public officials, and conse
quently not indictable by us. There seemed no j
reason for the peculiar exception, and that fu- i
ture ><Â»rand Juries mlg-ht gain Jurlsdloti^n in
surh cas-s we endeavored to remedy the defect.
Un-i-r our direction an amendment was pre
pared by the District Attorney and submitted
to the Legislature. The amendment failed of
; assage. as asserted, from lack of time, and
should be â  at the next ppssion.
There is something very suspicious in the fact
thut an obscure amendment in the Political
Code is made to nullify the plain provisions of
the Prnal Code applicable to all other public
We feel that we ought also to commend the
member* of the present Boanl of Education
for the creditable way In which they nave per
:ormM a dlfUcull duty. Taking office after an
unscrupulous board had done its worstâleav
ing a fegacy ot debt that was a groat outraee
en the teachers of the department and an army
of useless teachers, many of whom were Inno
cent victimeâ it boldly undertook to correst
abuses and bring the expenditures within
bounds.

report relative
'1-rk's office:
County Clerkâ "We fird County Clerk William i
A. Deane and his managing deputy. Joseph
Goddard. In fact all the attaches of the office,
thoroughly versed In the matters under their
charge as well as courteous and obliging, and
â we may add that these innovations in the
administration of the business of the office
have been the subject of much favorable com
ment frr.m the bench and bar. and of all whose
duties have called them to transact Important
matters in thla office.
Through a new system, also inaugurated by
Mr. Deane and effected by Mr. Goddard, it
will in the future be impossible to stuff Jury
boxes and the subsequent racking of Juries
will no longer be Included among the scan- |
dals of the City Hall.
Through the fact that the stability of our |
government rests largely upon the honesty of
the jurymen, to whom come all questions of
lifÂ« property and liberty, the importance of
this safeguard on the part of the County Clerk
cannot be passed by us without commendation. j
\Vf> find that this office is In first
class working order, with Increased business
and reduced clerical force, with clerks and
deputies courteous, obliging and efficient and !

UNION* DEPOT AND FERRY BUILDINGâ
The* sub-committee reports that the union depot
Js well managed and that the building pays
for itself. The revenue from all sources is i
about JSO^.W) l>er annum, of which J4631 is I
taken out by the Controller for the sinking !
fund used for the payment of bonds and in
terest. From the report a number of reduc
tions have been made and an extra $700 has
been charsred the Southern Pacific for use of
flips. The force of employes has been reduced j
AUDITORâ The sub-committee appointed to â 
Investigate the affairs of this branch of the j
municipal government, after favorably com
menting on â¢ -,,- methods employed in the man
agement thereof, refers to matters of present
Interest. It finds that during the first half j
year of Mr. Wells' administration demands j
amounting to J2.WpI.CS6 Co have been audited, j
The basement wherein the records of the as- !
sessment roll are kept contains about 100 vol- j
umes, which have been damaged by fire and ,
through lack of funds to rearrange them j

CITY AND COUNTY ATTORNEYâ During
the lnvostisatlon of the affairs of this office
the committee. C. B. .Icnnincs and H. M
Ulack tinds that during the administration i
<f Franklin K. Lane not a slrigle, Judgment
has been recovered against the city, while it
l.as been successful in t-1 cases. The committee
recommends that the library in this office be
enlarged and the rooms renovated and put In a
healthful condition.
SUPBKIOR AND JUSTICES COURTSâ The
commi'tee appointed to examine these offices
finds nothing worthy of special mention, with
the exception of the characteristic laziness of
the Janitor*, "who leave the various court
rooms without proper attention." They find â 
all the rooms in need of repair, and -suggest j
that additional provision for the publication of
the law journal be made that the courts may j
fi-.t be hampered during the ensuing year.
JUSTICES' CLERKSâ Here the committee
finds that the receipts amounted for the year ,
to $.:,"'.â â }, expenditures of the office proper $10.- I
6SO, which added to the Justices of the Peace
salaries, which amount to {12,100, leave* a de
ficit of about $4? Improvements in the clerk' c
office are also suggested.
HEALTH DEPARTMENT. ALMSHOUSE,
HOSPITAL, AND CITY PHYSICIANâ The re-
Port on these (governmental branches makes
plain the neglect of the Supervisors. It is sug
j tested by those acting on the committee that
: the City Receiving Hospital should be located
I In more healthful and cheerful quarters; that
I the old Almahouse building* should be repair

I healthful it comment) upon, and In conclu
( sion the committee "deplores and condemns
the many changes made for purely political
reasons," but this comment was stricken from
the report when it was read before the entire
body.
MATCH AND SUPERVISORSâ Th- sub
committemen In this report eulogize the Mayor
for "his efforts on bchalr of the people. " but
refrain from commenting therein on the "City
fathers."
CORONER. MORGUE AND PUBLIC
POUNDâ In this report the Supervisors again
come in for a grilling for their action in abol
ishing the office of matron at the Morgue, as
"almoft any woman might be unfortunate
enough to be can II this place in case of
sudden death, and for humanity's and de
cency's sake come provision should be made
for the reinstatement of a matron. The com
mittee finds room for many improvements
around the buildings and paraphernalia, but
find the offices well conducted.
POLICE DEPARTMENT, PATROL AND
CITY PRISON -After mentioning the courteous
treatment at the hands of Chief Lees, the com
mittee mentioned the great need of a patrol
boat to puurc] the water front. The "trusty"
tystem is depkred. and it is suggested that Jan
itors be provided to do the work laid upon their
shoulders. The boys' department is also the
I object of criticism, but all in all the conduct of
I the department Is favorably commented upon.
SHERIFF AND COUNTY JAILâ As usual,
the oommltteemen open their report by Ueplor
i ingr antiquated Broadway Jail. Improvemmts
. in all the iails are suggested, but the conduct
| of thp office is favorably reported upon.
RECORDER ELECTION COMMISSIONERS
AND PUBLIC ADMINISTRATOR- all of
1 these offices the commltteemen suggest minor
i improvements, but comment favorably on the
conduct thereof.
POLICE COURTSâ The committee that inves
tigated the courts in part say: "We have thor-
I ntigh!y investigated the common rumor in re-
I latlon to what is termed the 'pull* exercised, it
jis claimed, in Police Court cases, an fli that
i since the question of straw bonds has been set
tled that this difficulty has been overcome."
They find that workingmen arrested
for petty offenses are frequently dismissed at
i the discretion of the Judge, but such acts ca'.l
j for no disapproval.
WATER. GAS AND GAS INSPECTORâ The
j committee is of opinion that the fact that five
|of the twelve Supervisors were strongly op
| posed to the establishment ot" the water rat* as
I adopted gives ground to the suspicion that a
! greatly Inflated value of the company's prop
i erty was made as basis for the rate. ThÂ» fight
for the reduction of the gas rate, which was
â  successful, was favorably commented upon.
The committee also favors the lighting of all
I streets by electricity and concludes by com
â  mending Gas Inspector Tupper on the conduct
of his department.
TAX COLLECTOR'S AND LICENSE COL-
I LECTOR'S OFFICEâ These offices are found
running in good order and the heads thereof
complimented by the sub-committee.
SUPERINTENDENT OF STREETS. COUN
â  TV SURVEYOR AND GOLDEN GATE PARK
! â The deplorable condition of the streets and
sewers is commented upon by tha sub-commit
tee, but the blume is chargeable to the faulty
scheme of administration, not to the officials.
The Improvements in the park are extolled and
' the report concludes with favorable mention of
the magnificent gift made by Claim Spreckels of
a bar.', stand to cost 160,000. "to whom the
thanks of the people are due. as well as to
other public-spirited and philanthropic citizens
whose gifts have added to the attractions of the
park."

THE NOBLE RED MAN
TAKES THE PAVILION
"t'ph! Ugh!" said the noble red man.
"Las Ratas." replied the equally noble
Filipino, which is the I^uzonian equivalent
of the American "rats."
So the two races made faces at each
othÂ«=T and then clasped hands over the
whole Pa< ilic Ocean as represented by
the difference between the Grove and the
Hayes-street side of the Mechanics' Pa
vilion.
A very superior crowd of California
Indian? are these gentlemen of copper
color, who have arrived to show the
home life of the aborigines to an appre
ciative public. There is the "big medi
cine." "Captain Doctor Bill." He Is in
charge of the party. Now Captain Doc
tor Bill has been for many years looked
op to as the really next to the deity of
the entire Mendocino tribes.
Rut '"aptaln Doctor Bill Is not the only
distinguished member of the party. There
is Captain Jf-ff Dick, wno is noted as one
of the cleverest trappers of rabbits and
quail (and also, let it be said In an under
tone, of men, but this was in many years
agones Then, too. there Is Captain
Johnny Tinto O'Dougherty. Now Dick
and O'D"Ugherty are hereditary el
but it has always bt-Â«-:i a question where,
in the name of goodness, Mr. O'Dough
erty, who- never saw the Emerald Isle,
acquired his name. He does not know,
but he suggests that he used to work for
a man named O'Dougherty who owned a
hop field.
The Filipinos flocked by themselves and
gazed at the newcomers with eyes wide
open with curiosity. They whispered to
each other, "Indiol Indio!" But when
they fuund that the American Indian, of
whom they had read so much, was
neither a tarantula nor a centipede and
would not bite, they gathered around the
i ewcomers nnd gave full sway to their
foelings of curiosity.
Pretty soon Captain Jeff Dick and three
or four Filipinos were walking around
arm in arm, and although they could not
BDeak to each other In any language they
found full expression to tneir feelings and
to their sentiments in gesticulations and
erunts and smi^f. It ih expected by the
tim<- the fair opens, on Saturday night,
that the entire combination Filipino and
California Indian villagers will have be
come as one^

WAR VETERANS OF THE REBELLION
WILL MEET IN THE QUAKER CITY
PHILADELPHIA is the place that
has been selected for the holding
of the thirty-third annual na
tional encampment of the Grand
Army of the Republic during the week
â¢ ndng Monday. September 4. The
rit'xena of that city, acting up in a very
â  otic appeal issued by Mayor Ash
bridg"Â« to make the honored veteran
guests welcome and happy, have done
a great deal to make the stay of the
soldiers of '61 to '65 one of the most
mt that they have ever enjoyed
in any place ir. which they have met.
A camp capable of accomnvidating
11.000 soldier visitors has been pitched
in Falrmount Park. It is on the slop
ing ground immediately in froni
' t mansion, the historic home of
Judere Peters, who in the days of the
Revolution frequently entertained Gen
eral Washington and other noted men
of the time. The site overlook? the
Schuylklll River, and in the distance
may be *<>*n the great city founded by
William Perm.
At the head of the committees who
have charge of the grand reception to
be given the heroes of the war of the
Rebellion are General Louis Wagner,
Colonel Robert B. Beath, past c im
mander-in-chief of the Grand Army;
General James W. Latta, Colonel O. C.
Booby shell, Colonel Charles M. Betts
and Colonel James H. Matrinnis, and
these, with the various sub-commit
tee!?, have arranged elaborate plans of
decorations and entertainment. The
principal decoration will be Court of
Honor, which will extend on both sides
of the City Hall, and the marble mon
ument surmounted by the gigantic
statue of "William Perm will form the
central figure.
The Court of Honor is to be formed
of Corinthian columns fifty feet in
height, with smaller ones Intervening,
CASEY IS CHARGED.
Howard's Friend Arrested for Grand
Larceny.
â  Chief Lees took a step yesterday morn
ing to put an end to the habeas corpus
proceedings for the release from custody
of "Jackie" Casey. A complaint was
sworn to in Judge Slogan's court for
Casey's arrest on the charge of grand lar
ceny and he was booked at. the City Pris
on on the charge.
It is alleged that on May 2 Casey or
dered a suit of clothes and an overcoat
from Felix Block, a tailor, at 119 Butter
street. He called at the shop on May 15
during Block's absence and left, taking
with him the suit of clothes and overcoat-
Block Identified/ him in prison and also
the suit of clothes, although Casey had
disfigured them by substituting other
buttons and cutting out Block's name.
Casey denied to the police that he had
ever seen Block or ordered any clothes
from h'm. asserting that he purchased the
suit in Sydney, Australia, but later he ad
mitted procuring it and the overcoat and
said he had almost paid off the debt.
He has a large number of aliases, in
cluding J. Angus. Fred Arms, A. Cooper,
F. Dinnie, F. Watson and T. Denny. He
was known as Angus on the steamer
Mariposa, as A. Cooper in Australia, and
he registered as F. Watson at the Lang
ham Hotel and that name was on all his
trunks.
He suavely told all inquirers that he
never saw Howard in his life and was
blissfully ignorant of the robbery of 5000
. sovereigns from the steamer Alameda.
When the application for a writ of
habeas corpus on behalf of Casey came
up before Judge Murasky it was made
known to George D. Collins, who repre
sents the accused, that a charge had been
placed against hi name and Mr. Collins
then a^ked that the petition for the writ
be dismissed. Mr. Collins said that he
had been retained by people outside of
this State to defend Casey and whether
he was willing to go free or not he would
have forced his release if the police had
not seen fit to place a charge against his
name. "The charge against him at the
present time must also be disposed of
Immediately," he said. "The prosecution
has a right to two days' continuance and
then I will see that he is placed on trial
for the offense or released. The police
doubtless have had an easier time to keep
people in jail than they will have with
Casey notwithstanding that he Is willing
to help them. They must either prove him
guilty of the charges against him or he
will be given his liberty whether he de
sires it or not." _

A PARTHENIA
TO REMEMBER
THE beautiful doctrine of tradition
ha? r- :ne rather hard blows
during Mise Roberta' engagement at
the Alcazar this season. Twice, as
I remember, it made a half-hearted effort
to influence, but lacking encouragement
and even recognition it silenced its voice
and retired. The stage evils wrought by
the inroads of tradition are almost incal
culable. When old familiar roles are be
ir.er played, such liberal floods of it pour
down that a sort of 'iramatic washout is
the r< Ing the character bar>- of
natural feature or attraction. The old
theater-goer likes thisâ likes an actress to
be a handy and convenient summary of
all who have gone before. He can be
lieve in such knowingly and he will be
lieve no other way. Thus it happens that
many an artist capable of creation, but
fearful of criticism, clings to the old
until she shall have made a name, and
even tries 1 her future intentions,
knowing they will be promptly pounced
upon when they are reached. Miss Roii
â¢ rts' naturalness and originality are as
striking as they are aci eptable. They
are not the result of daring, but of n<
sity. Her stage career has known no idle
seasons. She has i , the great
In their parts and hi nee she is not
: up uf little pieces of all uth*r
('amities and Juliets and Parthenias,
using their methods for effect and trying
to act as if she had th( ir reasons. The
amateur vice of over elaboration is not
!_â¢ r~ in the least degree. Most surely is
she winning her way Into the hearts of
the people, and though the dramatic king
d'>m lias often been t.aken by violence.
thÂ»- quiet way is the b Jter, if one would
be something other tnan mÂ»-rely the
vogue. The ingenuousness and Bwei t
simplicity of her Parthenia are more
charming than she knows. She makes
of her a* maiden loving, dutiful, heroic,
unconscious of her virl le as she is of her
strength, following Hie promptings of
heart ami brain without question, ex
pecting no opposition and hence not
armed with commanding air. The child-
Isb purity her creation breathes makes
the mountain life seem th,e most natural
and possible thing in the world. Miss
rts Is by nature strongly emotional
and one of the most artistic things she
does is to keep her emotions within the
bounds natural to one whose heart has
not yet been awake;, ed by love. Mr.
WTilttlesey, though at lirst the true bar
barian, strong, brutal, uncouth, a free
child of the earth, fans more easily under
the spell of this Parthenia than has been
the wont of other lngomars. And why
should he not? Children are easiest led
where opposition is not expected and the
tone of command is but sparingly used.
Mr. Whittlesej c [ngomar is quite in tune
with Miss Roberts' Parthenia. She takes
his heart and his soul and his strength
without so much as "by your leave," and
he yields them, more in surprise than
anger. His mountain costume with its
queer iron chains and bands is artistically
barbaric and his entrance as the Greek
a signal for applause. The support is ad
equate and the production â¢Tetti.y staged.
The patronage during ineir season at the
Alcazar is the best proof that San Fran
cisco has appreciated the tireless efforts
M!~s Roberts and Mr. Whittlesey have
made to please and educate. Their de
parture is a regret, their return next sea
son a bright thought for the future,

MONTGOMERY IS
NOW BEING SUED
FOR A DIVORCE
Sequel of Sensational
Recent Episode.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway. Aug. 31.
John D. Montgomery, better known
i about town as "Jack" Montgomery, was
to-day .*ued for a divorce by his wife.
Jennie Montgomery, un the ground of
cruelty.
This is the expected sequel to a sensa
tional acid-throwing case in which the
couple appeared as principals about two
; months since. At that time the story was
published to the effect that Montgomery
, had been leading a double life, and that
his wife, after trailing him for a number
of weeks, had discovered him one night
in a Seventh-street restaurant in company
1 with a young unmarried woman, the
; daughter of H. Kucks. a saloon-keeper.
Every effort was made by Montgomery's
friends to prevent a scene, and in th!s
they practically succeeded, since the wife
was induced to permit Montgomery to ac
company her home.
Although appearing to have condoned
1 her husband's offense Mrs. Montgomery
was but plotting revenge, and a cruel re
venge at that, as subsequent events fully
reveakd. The next day the many friends
of the family were startled to learn that
; Montgomery's eyes had been blinded by
acid which his wife had thrown upon his
face while he slept. For hours Montgom
ery had wandered about the streets, seek
i ing some friends to help him in his
1 trouble, and when an oculist made his
< first examination of the optics it was
thought that the sight was gone forever.
! Good care, however, restored the sight,
' and Montgomery is now apparently as
! well as ever.
But the wife fled. She left her husband
' for good, and has now taken the step
, which will separate her from the man
whom she declares was unfaithful to his
â  marriage vows. Mrs. Montgomery's at
i torney is Colonel T. F. Garrity, and the
1 suit will probably go by default.
Another interesting divorce suit is that
filed by Beatrice Chase against Albert
<'hase "wherein desertion is given as the
ground for the cause of action. The young
' couple were married in San Rafael last
', March, and on the very eve of the cere
' mony, so the complaint reads, the hus
band deserted his young bride, who has
since become a mother. According to a
suit for maintenance filed late this after
noon the deserted young bride and mother
is now wholly dependent upon her own
exertions and the charity of relatives to
provide for herself and child; moreover,
business houses refuse her credit for the
' necessaries of life. She asks that the
court order her husband to pay So weekly
' for the support of herself and child and
$50 counsel fees pending the action.
The divorce suit of John Anderson
against Mary Alice Dorothea Anderson
I has been referred to Court CommiFsWn-r
I Babcock. owing to the failure ot defend
! ant to appear and answer. In his com

FATHER O'RYAN
LECTURED FOR
A GOOD CAUSE
Children's Day Homes
Are Benefited,
Rev. Philip O'Ryan, spiritual director of
the League of the Cross Cadet?;, and one
of the most popular priests of the diocese,
; delivered a lecture on "The Church and
Modern' Science" before a large audience
in St. Mary's Cathedra] last night for the
benefit of the children's day homes. In
part be said:
The age in which we live is pre-eminently an
age of science. The successful Ftu.ly of phys
j U-al or. as it is known, modern science has
been the distinguishing characteristic of the
nineteenth century. Modern science Is not
merely an intellectual diversion, but i; is es
sentially practical in it* aim and object. In
fact, it has been one of the createst factors
in modern pn gress and one of the most potent
elements in the development of modern indus
try. manua.'cture and commerce. The art? that
minister to man's needs and comforts, that pro
mote his physical welfare and raise the stand
ard of civilisation, have sprung up ami pros
pered la the atmosphere of science. Science
has been the magician's wand whose tcueli has
conjured up the magnificent fabric of modern
civilization.
In former year* man's knowledge of the world
of nature, it? forces and laws, was scant and
indefinite. He knew nothing of the. hidden
powers of â  tea) 1 and electricity, which have
' rendered such noble services in the cause of
i progress. He was harassed on all sides by
; invisible enemies, by disease Kt'rms, by mias
matic air. and in his iÃnorance he fell victim
to them. His ideas of the beautiful world of
creation were crude and Incorrect. His ears
were deaf to the wonderful music of the spheres
and his eye* were closed to the vision sublime
of the universe. The lightning, he believed,
came directly from the powers of the air: the
earthquakes he regarded as a mark of Gad's
wrath; comets were missiles hurled at a wicked
world.
With our ampler kr. â â . lÂ« - may bÂ« in
clined to laugh ai those eru le noi but we
Eliall not forget that it If : i 9 cen
turies ago since our ancest r â  '. that

FROM SLAVERY'S AUCTION
BLOCK TO LEGAL BAR
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway. Aug. 31.
The opportunities offered the lowliest to
rise and advance in the fields of the higher
professions in this country were again
demonstrated yesterday when Thomas
Pearson, aged 4u years, a leader in Afro-
American circles and a resident of this
city off and on for the past fifteen years,
was admitted by the Supreme Court to
practice his chosen profession, law.
Attorney I'earson was born in Warrir.g
ton, X. C. His parents y. â  > - -. and
his rise is that of one who at the tender
age of nine years was suld as a slave on
the auction block. He was purchased by
the Raleigh and Gaston Railroad Com
pany which intended making a mechanic
of him, but the downfall of the Confed
eracy resulted in his liberation and that
of his parents. The family came West
and settled in Vallejo, where the free pub
lic schools brought out in bold relief young
Pearson's capabilities.
His political movements during his lat
ter years as a close adherent and advo
cate of the principles of the Republican
party are well known. He has developed
oratorical powers of no mean Quality and
has stumped the State with some of the
most distinguished political speakers in
the Interest of the party he claims secured
his emancipation from the chains of
slavery.
In the early eighties Pearson attended
as a delegate the Afro-American Conven
tion held at the time in Washington, D.
C. He was chosen first vice president of
that body and presided with fitting dig
nity over its second session. Though non
fraternal, his modest yet genial disposi
tion and ever readiness to hV-lp those who
are struggling with life's battles has won
for him friends whosf number is legion.
He has pursued the =ti!<ly of law for
several years, and through diligence, fru
gality and closes^ application has sur
mounted the many ri'fficultJes that lie as
obstacles in the oath that leads to the
bar of the letral profession.
KATHERINE M'IVER
LEFT A LARGE ESTATE
OAKLAND, Aug. Katherine Mc-
Iver, who died at Mission San Jose on
July 21 last, left an estate valued at $100.
--000, but no will .has been found disposing
of the same. To-day her husband, Charles
C. Mclver, petitioned for letters of admin
istration. According to the petition the
estate includes over 729 acres at Mission
San Jose valued at $80,000, also personal
property, wine cellar, supplies and stocks,
valued at 112,000. Tne heirs are the wid
ower, a son and two daughters. .
Jane Heivers has petitioned for letters on
the estate of Charles D. O'Gara, the sa
loon man, who committed suicide on July
20 last without leaving a will. The value
of the estate Is not known, but includes
$1500 worth of Oakland real estate. The
heirs are four children and the widow,
who has renounced her right to letters on
the estate.
Public Administrator Hawes has applied
for letters on the estate of Leonard M.
Farwell, who died Intestate on the 24th
inst. The estate consists of $126 cash ami
two life-insurance policies aggrtgating
SDOOO. The only heirs known are a son
and daughter residing in Grant City. Mo.

BIG GATHERING
OF METHODISTS
Annual Conference at
Pacific Grove.
' Dispeti h to The CaH.
PACIFIC GROVE. Aug. 31.â The an
nual California Methodist Episcopal
terence, which opens In the Metho
dist church in this city on September
6, promises to be one of the largest
â as it is certainly the most impor
tantâsession of that body that has
been held in recent years.
The attendance is to be gTeatly in
creased this year because of the quad
rennial election of delegates to the
General Conference, that is to be heM
in Chicago in May. 1900, as every mem
ber deems it his duty as well as privi
lege to cast his vote in choosing the
delegates, and the importance of this
is increased this year, as it is the first
time in the history of Methodism when
lay and ministerial representation at
the General Conference is to be equa:.
The conference will open on Wednes
day, September 6. Bishop W. X. Ninde
presiding, and will continue its ses
sions to the 13th at least.
On the 14th, the Lay Association, an
unofficial gathering of California
Methodist laymen, will hold an ali-day
session, and on the 15th the lay elec
toral conference, the official quadren
nial conference of lay delegates, will
â  meet to elect delegates to the General
Conference.
Rev. Dr. Filben, who has charge of
the arrangerr-ents for entertaining the
conference visitors, is overrun with ap
plications for accommodations, and
says every facility of the iown will, be
called into requisition to house the un
usual number of people.
The conference membership is nearly
400, the lay electoral conference will
' bring over* 200 and the lay association
in the neighborhood of 500 persons.
These, with the \arge number of people
who attend the conference, but being
to none of teh soc.eties. will bring the
attendance well up Into 1500.
If present rumors prove correct this
; conference is to result in a pretty gen
i eral change among the pastors of the
more important city churches, and the
usual shake-up is expected among the
country charges. There is also a be
lief that Dr. W. W. Case, presiding
I elder of the San Francisco district, is
' to be succeeded by Dr. J. A. B. Wilson,
now of the Howard-street Church, but
nothing definite has as yet appeared in
corroboration of this opinion.
nurse there will be a fight over
the delegates to be sent to the general
' conference, the great law-making body
of the church, and the outcome is now
very much in doubt. The opportunity
to have a part in the deliberations of
this body is a much-desired honor, and
! there are many among the members of
the California conference who greatly
covet the office of delegate. Dr. Case
and Dr. F. C. Lee are two who have
beer, mentioned as the probable choice"
of the conference.
The daily programme of the confer
ence will include morning and evening
sessions, the afternoons to be devoted
! to the anniversary celebrations of the
' various conference societies, the work
i of which forms a very material part of
! the conference business.
Bishop Ninde will arrive here on
Tueslay. the sth. and an official recep
tion given under the auspices of the
Itinerants' Club of the conference will
', be tendered him in the evening. The
address of welcome to the Bishop will
; be delivered b/ Rev. Dr. Thomas Fil
; ben, superintendent of Pacific Grove,
; and one of the most prominent mem
bers of the conference.
The conference sessions will begin at
I 9 a. m. on "Wednesday, the 6th.
before the estate was settled or distrib
uted. The heirs are three sons and two
daughters.
At the request of the widow David F.
McWade applied to-day for letters on the
estate of George H. Garthorne, who 'lied
intestate in October. 1^97. leaving propvriv
w.irth $2(xÂ»X The heirs are the widow and
two children.
WILL THROW SISTER'S
ASHES TO THE WINDS
OAKLAND, Aug. 31.â Through an appli
cation made to the secretary' of the Board
of Health to-day to secure a permit to
I remove the ashes to this city of a person
! who had been cremated in San Francisco,
a strange dying wish of a Mrs. Naughton
I of San Francisco, sister of Mrs. L. E.
Drake of this city, was revealed. Mrs.
; Naughton expressed a desire that all that
i was left of her remains after incineration
j should be returned to nature. It was Mrs.
| Drake's idea to take the ashes to Moun
, tain view Cemetery and there, instead of
I depositing the urn in a vault or burying
I It In a plat, to throw its contents to the
winds. "They will soar to the heavens."
I said ?he. "and we who are God's creatures
[ will come nearer to God."
MADDEN IS GIVEN
THE FULL PENALTY
OAKLAND. Aug. Itâ W. E. Madden
pleaded guilty to a charge of petty lar-
I ceny in the Police Court to-day, and
Judge Smith gave him the full limit of the
, lawâ six months in the City Prison. When
Madden was arrested several weeks ago
with his young wife for stealing jewelry
, at a "Washington-street hotel where they
1 had been employed Judge Smith let htm
off with a light sentence on the strength
!of a plausible story and the plea for
i mercy begged by the wife. No sooner was
; he released than he deserted the wife
who had pleaded for him. Yesterday Dp
; tective Holland rearrested Madden in San
j Francisco on a charge of stealing a gold
â¢ watch. He is a morphine fiend.
WOLF REMANDED ON
THE BIGAMY CHARGE
OAKLAND, Aug. 31.â Judge Hall this
morning denied the petition for a writ of
habeas corpus brought by Charles L.
Wolf, conrined in the County Jail on a
charge of bigamy, remanding the prisoner
for trial. On going back to the jail Wolf
declared to his keepers that it was a
"burning shame" that he could not get
out. Things look pretty black for the
prisoner, as he has confessed to several
peace officers that he was never divorced
from a woman whom he married in Dela
ware.
Knudson Admits His Guilt.
OAKLAND. Aug. 31.â Matt Knudson,
whom the police arrested as being the in
dividual who robhed the Coffin residence
two weekÂ«= ago. where he stole a bicycle,
has admitted his guilt to Captain of Po
lice Wilson. In making his confession
Knudson said thr.t on the same night he
burglarized the Coffin place he made an
â¢ . tual attempt to enter the Hamilton
rÂ» si.'erce next door. Knudson was cap
tured in Santa Cruz trying to dispose ot
his stolen bicycle.

JAPAN WILL
INQUIRE INTO
THE OTA CASE
An Unfriendly Feeling
Is Alleged.
WHY MR. GAGE WAS LENIENT
There is likely to be a diplomatic tilt
; between the United States and Japan
! over the Ota incident, and the relation?
between the two countries may become
strained in consequence.
General- W. H. L. Barnes and Immigra
tion Commissioner North are at the bot
tom of it. and General Barnes has trans
ferred the preliminary skirmish from the
United States District Court to the United
States Court of Appeals. If he does not
succeed in obtaining .justice for his client
in that court he will go before the .Su
preme Court of the United States and
make of the .habeas corpus case of S.
Ota a celebrated one in the law books.
In the meantime the Japanese Govern
ment will not wait for the sluggish prog
ress of the legal river through the
choked-up channels of the courts, but
will lay the matter before the adminis
tration.
Ota is a Japanese merchant doing busi
ness in this city for the past eight years
and paying taxes on several thousands
of dollars' worth of property. He went
to Japan last March and purchased $3000
worth of new stock, and on his return
was denied admittance to this country
by United States Immigration Commis
sioner North on the ground that 'Ota was
an alien immigrant and that he was af
flicted with a contagious disease. â¢
The contention was raised on habeas
corpus by General Barnes that he was
not an immigrant and for that reason
was entitled to land. Judge de Haven
agreed with General Barnes in that re
spect, but held that he had no jurisdic- â¢
tion to review or set aside the action of
the Immigration Commissioner. Ota had
appealed also to the Secretary of the !
usury, and a letter from National Im
migration Commissioner Powderly to i
Commissioner North, sustaining his ac
tion, was approved and signed by the j
Secretary of the Treasury. Yesterday on
a second application for a writ of habeas
corpus Judge de Haven reiterated his
opinion that North had. erred and that
Ota was the victim of a great legal in
justice, but that the court had no power
to Interfere.
General Barnes remarked that it was
a strange condition of affairs when a res
ident taxpayer could be outraged in such
a matter and the courts could not in
terfere. â¢ I
Mr. North is in Washington and could
not be interviewed as to his opinion of ,
! Judge de Haven's opinion, but it is be
lieved that his action was inspired by
the reported unfriendly action of Japan
in selling arms and other munitions of
war to the. Filipino rebels. During the
existence of the war with Spain it was
observed that the Secretary of the Treas
; ury was lenient toward Japanese immi
i grants, and in several cases ordered them
i landed after Mr. North had denied them
admission, the evidence having convinced
i him that they were contract laborers.
i When Mr. North pursued an investiga
: tion into the reasons for the ' sudden
! suavity of the Secretary of the Treasury
toward Japanese immigrants in particu
lar, he received a quiet tip from one who
knew to the effect that it was the policy
of the administration to be very sweet
with Japan during the war with Spain,
for Japan was in a position to do the
United States great damage by covertly,
if not openly, assisting the Spaniards in
the Philippines.
With the close of the war with Spain
came the reaction, and Mr. North found
that his official acts were once more be
ing sustained by the Secretary.
The action of Commissioner North in
excluding Ota has been generally con
demned in legal circles, and for that rea

BRAVE FIREMEN HURT
'NEATH FALLING WALLS
Greedy Flames Consume a
Block of Fire-Traps.
Planing Mills and Machine Shops Destroyed,
and the Losses Will Mount Up
to Many Thousands.
THE charred ruins of a quarter |
block of planing mills and small
factories to the value of about
half a million dollars, thousands of
dollars' worth "of machinery
burned arid warped to ruin and two gal
lant "nremen-Jim Cailen, assistant fore
man of engine IT. and Philip Den eke of
the same crew-scorched and mangled un
der falling rookery walls, is the net result
of a conflagration that broke out last
night In the Thompson Planing Mill Com
pany's sheds at the northwest corner of!
Mission and Fremont streets.
The blaze was discovered by Special
Officer Robert Sample, who turned in an
alarm from box 261. Two more alarms
followed as on as the first engine
reached the scene, and in little more than
the time it takes to tell it every steamer
in the district was throwing water Into
the burning district.
From almost the start it was evident
that none of the flimsy structures in the
rath Of the fire could be saved. The blaze
was coniined to the wooden buildings by
Holbrook. Merrill & Stetson's big brick
Btructure on Fremont and Market streets
and by. a row of bricks at the corner of
Mission and Main streets, The Fire De
partment divided Its force to save the row
of frame buildings across Mission street,
which repeatedly took lire from the in
tense heat of the general conflagration.
The police handled the enormous crowd
that gathered admirably. Fully 5000 peo
ple were attracted by the three alarms
and scurrying engines, but no arrests
were made, and despite the intense ex
citement which followed the falling of the
walls and the bursting of boilers the best
of order was maintained.
" The origin of the fire could not be de
termined. Office Sample, who discovered
it was walking along Fremont street and
saw the blaze through the windows of a
vacant stoVe. It is his opinion that it
started from the boiler or firebox in the
mill of the Thompson Planing Company, |
for by the time he had turned in the first !
alarm the flames were already bursting I
through the roof of that building. They
rapidly communicated with the buildings
occupied by the California Iron Works,
the T. B. 'Whitney Scale Manufacturing
Company and . the Merrill Milling Com
pany. 'â¢ '
The last . engine had not arrived when
the heavy steampipe in Thompson's mill
exploded and sent through the burning
windows and. rapidly falling, roof clouds
of cinders that' at once set off the lesser
building? in the fire zone.. The- old Joshua
Hendy. Machine Works. and the saloon of
Gus Dencker at the corner blazed up and
although the engineers ordered their men
buck out of danger of the collapsing walls
the crews refused safety; and attempted
to save the shanties still standing on the i
Fremont . street side.
It was work such as this that nearly
cost .brave. Phil 'Denehy and Phil Callen
their lives. With the. rest of the crew
of 17 Knglne they were handling two
lines of hose they "had taken into the
Whitney Scale Company's shops on Fre
mont street.- The roof of the building had
already gone In. and the one object of the
fight was to save the stock and ma
chinery.: Heavy machinery falling from
the second floor of â  the Bendy building
started the walls toppling, and Denehy
and Callen were caught underneath a
whole side. The tiose - was dropped and
every man of the. crew and a score of
police seized the burning timbers despite
their own burns, and soon had the injured
men In safety across the street. At the
Harbor Hospital,- where both were taken.
It was found that â¢ Callen was nearly
blinded by cinders and. melted tar. He
had an ugly gash over his left eye, and.
ills left ankle was sprained. Chief Sulli
van ordered him removed at once to St.
Mary's Hospital. Denehy was badly cut
and "wrenched and suffered a number of
slight burns, but after proper attention
was able to walk from the hospital.
H. S. Chafee. an employe of the J. B.
Whitney Company, nearly lost his life In
an effort to save his firm's books-. He got
inside, and while gathering up his effects
was hemmed in by the flames. He was
thrown a rubber blanket, and with the
aid of a couple of firemen succeeded in '

FAMOUS SINGLE
TAXER ARRIVES
JOHN S. CROSBY, A FOLLOWER OF HENRY GEORGE-

O .I .first visit to the coast and. he comes here expressly to attend the sixtieth Â°
â *" *"' anniversary of the birthday of Henry George. o
? A delegation of single taxers were assembled â¢at the Sixteenth-street +
O station, Oakland, to welcome Mr. Crosby. Among the party were Joseph o
+ Leggett, E.Pomeroy, Daniel E. Beck. Daniel- Stewart, T. P. Hodgkin and 4-

O who will expound his theories and the working of them to San Francisco
4 audiences during the next few days. . O
O "Every day brings new converts into the single tax camp," said Mr. 4
â¦ Crosby last night while crossing on the Oakland ferry. "Our progress Is as . O
? rapid as one could reasonably ask for; in fact, we could not expect any- Q
O thing more fruitful. Strong men are throwing their whole being into the +

O emerged from' the purely economic consideration of the subject. The ques- 4
-4 tion now assumes the form and shape of a political Issue, and as such it Is O
O more Instinct with life than any other issue of the day. +
T "It Is almost agreed that the single tax Is the proper method of taxa-
+ tion. The only thing that causes people to pause Is in fixing the compensa- o
O tion, for the great multitude of voters do not wish to Interfere with vested +
4. rights. Public ownership of utilities is in direct line with the principles, of o

COMPLAINT CHARGING
FRENNA WITH MURDER
PRELIMINARY EXAMINATION
WAS POSTPONED.
George D. Collins as Special Prose
cutor Objects to the Accused
Being Liberated on Bail.
Joseph P. Frenna appeared before Judge ;
Graham yesterday morning for prelimin
ary examination, but the entire matter |
was postponed until Saturday morning at
10 o'clock.
Attorney Hosmer. representing the ac
cused, asked the. court to fix bail for his
I client on the ground that the Coroner's ,
jury had returned- a verdict of manslaugh
ter, which is a bailable offense. George
' D. Collins, the attorney who has br-en con
nected with Turner's legal affairs for some
years and who is now engaged as special
prosecutor of Frenna. objected to this,
and a long argument followed.
Collins stated that he would file a com- |
plaint charging Frenna with murder, I
which complaint would be ready to-iru.r
row afternoon. The court continued the ;
i case until Saturday morning, when the
' preliminary examination on the charge of
murder as preferred by Collins will he
held.
Every day a few more of V.ie vrefims of
Turner's skillful and shady .. business
manpiulations are rominp: to the fprnt. It
Is said on authority that Turner left an
estate which aggregates half a million
dollars. With this in mind every chip of
the duped will come from iin<lcr the cover,
mill th^ law courts will present some in
teresting' trials.
INHUMAN TREATMENT
OF MAGGIE O'CONNELL
DIED OF STARVATION AND
NEGLECT.
The emaciated body of Maggie O'Con
neii was buried yesterday, the funeral
having been delayed for an hour by order
of tlie Coroner in orrler to allow a hastily
summoned jury an opportunity to inspect
the remains. Coroner Hill informed the
reporters that an attempt had been made
by the relatives to keep fmm the knowl
edge of the Coroner the circumstances i
attending the woman's death in order
that she might lie buried without an offi
cial investigation and the consequent ex- 1
posure of negleCl and starvation.
According to the story told by Dr.
Cluness to the Coroner. Miss Q'.Connell, !
a domestic servant, aged ".Â»; years, took |
a room in the lodging house at 717 Bush !
street two weeks ago. Shortly after her;
arrival she was taken sick, but refused to
call in a doctor. Finally, when her illness i
had taken an alarming turn, the land- j
lord summoned Dn Cluness. He saw that
her condition was critical and advised
that Â«<he be removed to the City and
County Hospital, where she would re
ceive good enre and treatment, but she i
objected. The woman died last Tuesday
and according to the Coroner's story the
immediate cause of her death was ,
starvation and neglect, while a brother
and a niece lived within a block of her I
and never came near her to minister to |
her wants.
An inquest will be held this morning.
. m â 
THE POTTER'S FIELD.
Fate of Mrs. Naomi Baker, Who Left
Home to Seek Adventures.
The medical testimony in the matter
of the death of Mrs. Naomi Baker at the
inquest yesterday morning was to the ef
fect that death was due to septicaemia,
or blood-poisoning, tne result of an ab
scess in the pelvis, and that the kicking
which she said she had received from
three men on July 17 had nothing what
ever to do with her death. The jury re
turned a verdict that death was due to
natural causes.
It was developed by the testimony that
a worthless parasite known as â¢"Louis"
had been appropriating the earnings of
the woman and had beaten- anfl kicked
her a short time before he took her to
the hospital. The quarrel arose over $10
which the woman desired to keep to pay
her way to her old home in the southern
part of the State, she having become dis
gusted with the life she had been lead
ing for the past few months.
The woman's husband telegraphed yes
terday to Detective Anthony that he <iiii
not desire the body sent to him and that
he prefeired that the city should bury
her In the potter's field. Her remains
were interred yesterday by the city.
"Louis " is wanted by the police, but
cannot be found.
M. BerkowitZ, the young man arrested
on suspicion, was released later in the
day.
MRS. RIKERT IS STUBBORN.
Will Appeal to the Supreme Court
From Judge Troutt's Sentence.
Mrs. Annie Kline Kikert, president of
the Stockton and Tuolumne Railroad,
with her secretary. R. S. Clarke, appeared
before Judge Troutt yesterday In answer
to his order made In the contempt pro
ceedings. They still refused to produce
the company's books, and thereupon
Judge Troutt made an order committing
both to jail for contempt of court. The
court granted a stay of execution in the
matter, however, and to-day Mrs. Rikert
and Secretary Clarke will apply to the
.Supreme Court for a writ of habeas cor
pus. The case was then continued one
week pending the decision of the Supreme
Court In the matter of the writ.

NO OCTOBER
PAY FOR THE
PEDAGOGUES
Schools to Close for
Three Weeks.
TAX LEVY IS NOT SUFFICIENT
A MONTH OF RETRENCHMENT
DECIDED UPON.
Board of Education Will Have Legal
Advice Upon Its Scheme When It
Meets To-Night in Reg
ular Session.
Tf the law allows It the : chnols will be
' closed in October and the teachers will
lose Btill another month's salary. This
1 much the Board of Education decided at
one of tts little sideshow meetings neld
:on Wednesday night. There were only
! five members present, but they were the
live that do the business of the depart
â¢ ment. and their quiet little seance was
â¢ protected from the knowledge of the curi
ous by a notice that the regular meeting
had been postponed to last night, which
was posted on the outer door. Last night
| another notice was posted stating that the
| meeting was again postponed to to-night.
October is fixed as the month in which
I the teachers are to be offered up as a
'â â  sacrifice. In justice to the board it is
; well to announce that so far as its cal
culations have gone a thirty days 1 cut
lin pay is not in the scheme. The schools
: -ire to be closed and salaries withheld,
but for three weeks only; a concession of
â¢ a week which will be of untold' benefit to
1 the teachers and serve to square the de
partment. No plans have yet been made
to either cut or withhold the salaries of
the clerical force of the Superintendent's
department, but that justice may be done
; the teachers and their burden made lighter
this will no doubt be done.
The resolution of the board to close the
schools is a direct result of <he tax levy.
With a deticit of over $200,000 to overcome
â¢i ml an apportionment for the present fis
cal year of only J1.1W.000 and a few odd
dollars' retrenchment is made an absolute
necessity and the teachers have been hit
UDOn as'the only consistent and profitable
way out of the financial dilemma. The
example of the last board is to he fol
lowed in that respect. Owing to a short
â¢iue of funds the teachers lost their No
vember and December salaries In 1898.
Upon that occasion It was a clean loss
to them, for they worked through both
months before the board's intention to
bunko them was announced. The pres
ent board, however. Is n<.< doing business
: on that principle and intends to announce
. its intention beforehand and close the
â  schools so that the pedagogues may lose
their pay in idleness.
The scheme to close for three weeks in
! October will be broached to-night after
I the board has gone into executive session
j upon the usual motion of Superintendent
i Webster. City and County Attorney-
Lane and the board's attorney, Samuel
Knight, will be admitted to the delibera
tions and will be called upon to render
i a decision as to whether or not the board
I ma y legally withhold salaries even if It
i does c'.os-e the schools. There has always
i been that question undecided and at last
!it is to be settled. If Attorneys Lane and
i Knight say yes, it goes with the board;
the order will issue to close every de
partmentâPrimary, Grammar and High
Schoolâ on October 1. If Attorneys Lane
and Knight say no, then the board wilt
renew its pull on the Board of Supervis
i ors to have the dollar limit expanded and
! a couple of more hundred thousand dol
; j arg added to Its apportionment.
Up to Tuesday the political members of
the Board of Education were not worry
ing as to their low allowance. They had
been assured by different wise ones that
the Supervisors were going to give them
