ingo's Government*
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CAPE HAYTIEN, Hayti, Aug. 3.â lt has just become known that an
armed insurrection has broken out at Tavoga, a town seventy
eight miles northwest of San Domingo, in favor of Jiminez, who
aspires to the Presidency in succession to the late President Heureaux.
Later advices from the Dominican republic indicate that the rev
olution is growing in strength.
At Santiago de la Cruz 500 well-armed men have risen under the
command of General Ramon Pacheco, and General Preyes. who is
very influential in these districts, has joined the insurgents with sev
eral other generals, each commanding fairly important forces.

HAVANA. Aug. 3. â Tn conversation I
â¢with a Herald correspondent to-day i
Juan Isidro .Timiiiez, candidate for
the dictatorship of San Domingo, said:
"For the last few years I have been
â¢working against -ident Heureaux.
I have worked Eunoi foreign powers,
I have landed filibustering expeditions
and at last my plans are successful.
"They were my agents who killed j
President Heureaux, and I am going to
the Tnited States in a day or so to or
ganize another party who will go with
me to San Domingo, and if necessary,
take forcible possession of the Govern
ment. The people do not want Fi
guero; they want me and they shall
have me."
General Jiminez will be accompanied ;
to the United States by Captain Pied
ra of the police force and several
prominent Cuban army men who sym
pathize Ith him.
I saw cables to-day that General j
Jiminez sent to his agents in San Do- J
mingo, saying that unless the present |
Government retired before the 15th of
this month he would lead a general up
rising and take forcible possession of
the island. His movement is attracting
attention here because of the number of
prominent men concerned. Gomez is
said to favor Jiminez.

MINISTER POWELL
SAVES PRISONERS

At the request of United States Minis- ;

execute the prisoners arrested yester- J
day.
Th<> political situation here has im
proved and the city is calm. The
prompt action of Minister Powell, in
the case of M. Duvivier. tho newspaper
man, who was taken by police officers
out of the American Legation, has
created an excellent impression among
the foreign population. wh<> consider
that the action of the Hayttan Govern
ment in surrendering the prisoner to
the Minister on his demand probably
avoided serious trouble. The people
who have been BXMSted here are ac- i
ciised of plotting the overthrow of the.

The Bishop said the determined aliena

MERGER SAYS DREYFUS WILL
BE CONVICTED.
PARLIAMENT BUILDING AT RENNES.
Where the coming second court-martial trial of Captain Dreyfus will be held this month.
PARIS, Aug. 3. â The Intransigeant publishes a statement which General Mercier is said to have made
to a friend, in which the ex-Minister of War said: "Certainly Dreyfus will be convicted again. Either
he is guilty or I am, and I shall prove him to be a traitor."
Revisionist organs assert that General Mercier intends to declare at Rennes that Count Munster,
the German Embassador to France, showed him proof of Dreyfus' guilt, at the same time saying if Mercier
published the evidence he (Munster) would deny it.
It appears that the Minister of War. General Marquis de Gallifet, has absolved all military wit
nesses at the court-martial of Captain Dreyfus at Rennes from professional secrecy, with the exception
that he has requested them not to divulge the names of French agents abroad or disclose anything which
could complicate the foreign relations of France.
LONDON. Aug. 3. â The Paris correspondent of the Times, referring to the Mercier matter, recalls
Germany impressively denied that any of her agents or officials had relations with Dreyfus. The corre
spondent adds: "Everybody is aware if the attempt is made to involve Germany in the affair the coun
try will consider such proceeding a premeditated insult, and would immediately ask for a disavowal. We
need not, therefore, further heed the intentions attributed to General Mercier, unless it is part of a plan
of the general staff, of which General Mercier is an unintelligent instrument, to use him for the purpose,
obliging the court-martial to be held in camera, in order to avoid possible complications that might arise
from such a declaration as General Mercier is reported to contemplate making. This method of throw
ing an air of mystery around a portion of the proceedings will vitiate the whole trial by giving an op
portunity for saying that as all is not known to the public the verdict remains uncertain and question
able." ,

THE PHILIPPINE WAR
"God May Be Upon the Firing Line," He Says,
"But I Do Not Believe It."
SAX RAFAEL. Aug. 3.â "lt is said
that the anchor of the battleship
lowa has been sunk deep in the
waters of San Francisco Bay.
Much graver and more important
is the statement of a legion of repre
sentative American citizens that the
iron anchor of the Declaration of Inde
pendence has been sunk out of sight in
the mud of politics. I am not bo sure
that their words are not right. Ladies
and gentlemen. God may be upon the
firing line of the Philippines, but I do
not believe it."
In impassioned words and with vehe
ment gesture expressing firm convic
tion in the truth of his utterances. Rev.
Dr. William Rader, pastor of the Third
Congregational Church of San Fran
cisco, stood in the pulpit of the Prpsby
frian Church of this city to-night and
denounced the policy of the adminis
tration "in the present war. The ex
tract heading this article forms one of
hiÃ most vigo'roua utterances. During
his sermon, which came as a surprise,
a pin could have been heard to drop,
and at the conclusion the audience
burst into long continued applause.
The occasion was the fiftieth quar
terly convention of the Golden Gate
Union of the Christian Endeavorer*. the
eloquent preacher being scheduled to
deliver a sermon upon the subject of
"Our Personal Responsibility to Our
Country." His first utterance way that
the citizens of the American republic
are living in troublous times, a
period when every man should watch
the signs of the times, a day when the
dally papers are almost as indispensa
ble as the Bible.
"I knew a boy," he continued, "who
at the beginning of the war in the
Philippines was the most skillful ath
lete In the Christian organization of
which he was a member. His eyes
sparkled with animation, and his
cheeks glowed with perfect health. He
went to war. Some time later I was
preaching to a body of young soldiers
about to leave for Manila, and telling
them to fight for God and their coun
try, when that boy came In and stood
fler the care of a physician. To-night he
Is much improved and thf doctors look for

the cane on which he leaned, were a.
material condemnation of McKinley, <-f

thing to do with promoting this ter

thought a while. I have thought since
then, and ladies and gentlemen, I tell
you that if God is upon the firing line
of the Philippines, I cannot see it."
Turning his attention to war rs a
generic theme. Dr. Rader declared the
Peace Conference of the Czar of Rus
sia would result in nothing. The world,
in his opinion, is hungering ior war,
and will have it. He believed that the
nations of the earth are trembling on
the verge of the bloodiest warfare ever

I The groan of every dying soldier, the

HARVEY CASE TO
BE INVESTIGATED
Grand Jury to Take Up
Charges.
Social Dispatch to The Call.
SAN RAFAEL, Aug. 3.â The allegations
of bribery made by Mrs. J. P. Roberts in
Uon with the trial of Joe Harvey
on a charge of conducting a banking gum?
In his poolrooms at Sauflalito have re
ceived such consideration from District
Attorney Mclsaac that the matter will
be laid before the Grand Jury for investi
gation by that body at its next session.
When Mrs. Roberts' statement was made
public to-day a sensation was created,
not so much on account of the charge of
bribery but because of the prominence
of the persons alleged to be concerned In
the affair.
For seme time, the woman says, she
has had good reason to suspect that her
husband was enamored of Mrs. Josephine
Nelson, the wife of a contractor now in
Chicago. On one occasion she followed
him to a place near Schuetzen Park and
caused considerable gossip by chasing
him with a club. Her tale of unfaithful
ness borne out in many respects,
among the bits of evidence in her posse
sion being a note to her . husband which
she claims is in the handwriting of Mrs.
Nelson This note Is written on one of
Roberts 1 own billheads, with the headlines
torn off, and is signed "G. M. Grosse."
In it Roberts is requested to meet the
writer at the Oakland ferry at h p. m.
in regard to securing a piece of work at
San Leandro.
When the wife first visited the authori
ties it was m. rely to get out a warrant
for her husband on the charge of cruelty,
she taking this means to have him
brought back to Pan Rafael. Later she
discovered that Mrs. Nelson had recently
fallen heir to an estate valued at $40,000
by the death of an uncle in Chicago, and
then determined to sue her for alienation
of Roberts' affection. Finally she be
came worked up to such a pitch of in
dignation in brooding over her alleged
wrongs thar she concluded to be revenged
and went to the authorities with the tale
that Trustee A. Sylva of Sausalito had
procured $60 from Harvey, which was
given to ex-Sheriff Harrison, now chip,
engineer at San Quentin Prison, for dis
tribution among three jurorsâ Roberts.
Ramon Valencia and a man whose name
sh*- has forgotten. These facts, she
claims, were divulged to her by her hus
band while he was partially Intoxicated.
Mrs -Roberts is frank to admit that ncr
motive in charging bribery is reven^
she says she would far r<uher see her
husband behind the walls of San Quentin
than in the company of Mrs. nelson.
Nevertheless, her tale is given credence
by the authorities for several reasons.
She is not an educated woman and could
hardly have Invented so plausible a tale,
while the statements mad.: simply bear
out suspicions harbored for some time.
"The evidence given against Harvey was
so plain " said District Attorney Mclsaac
to-day "that I was mystified when the
jury 'was so quick to acquit. Tales of
bribery were rumored at the time, but
Mrs. Roberts has furnished the first tan
gible evidence, and we now have some
thing on which to work. The matter shall
be laid before the Grand Jury, and I am
confident that we shall be able to get
enough evidence to 'make it warm' for
several persons."
Sheriff Taylor says he does not doubt
bribery was committed, though he will
not pretend to say who were the agents
employed. He thinks it possible that some
of the jurors left out at first may have
sent to Harvey afterward and demanded
their share of the spoils. He has been
busily at work to-day trying to obtain
evidence and has taken the statements of
several persons. Ramon Valencia, one of
the accused men,. denies vigorously that
he ever received or asked for a cent, and
further claims that he knows of nobody
else who received any money.
Despite Harvey's denial that he knew
Roberts until the latter introduced him
self on a ferryboat, he admitted to Mrs.
Roberts in Sausallto that he knew her
husband well but had not seen him for
weeks. He said the last time he had seen
Roberts the two had walked up Market
street together. Roberts was frequently
seen in Harvey's poolrooms at Sausallto
after the trial.
Late last evening the alleged erring hus
band came to this city and went to the
Hotel Rafael. He told an acquaintance
that his intention was to collect a bill.
He remained there only a few minutes
t.nd managed to leave town on the 10:13
p. m. train before the authorities could
tee him. He slipped Into his own house
while bib wife was at a neighbor's and
meeting his young son there told him he
Intended never to return home again but
would procure a divorce from his wife
because of the things she had said against
him. When Mrs. Roberts heard or this
she rushed down to the West End station
with the intention of intercepting him,
but he succeeded in evading her. To-day
she again visited District Attorney Mc
lsaac and had a long consultation with
him. She afterward refuÃed to say what
she had told that official, saying that she
had been cautioned to keep what had oc
curred a secret.

STUDIED SOCIOLOGY
IN EASTERN CITIES
Mrs. Mary Roberts Smith Returns to
Stanford Laden With New
Ideas.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY. Ausr. S.-
Mrs. Miry Roberts Smith, assistant pro
fessor of sociology at Stanford, returned
to the university to-. lay after an absence
on Wave of fourteen months. . The time
' ha? been spent principally in study and in
practical sociological work. Last summer
attended the New York School of
Philanthropy, a new venture and the
. only ore . f its sort in the country. It
is conducti-d by the Charity Organization
; Society of New York City and is fur the
! purpose of teaching applied philanthropy
! to advanced students.
The method of the school is novel but
veil adapted to its purpose. During the
morning the students discuss practical
: questions relating to their work and listen
1 to addresses by experts on the different
1 subjects, principally men who are act
ually connected with public Institutions,
â  such as politicians ami beads of hospitals,
asylums prisons and the various institu
tions of the city for the care of children.
Following these' talks the students immt
: diately visited the institutions Ulustrat
i ing the lecture. In this way about a hun
dred institutions were visited and invtsti
; gated during the summer.
At the same time each student carried
!on Independent practical investigation,
i each choosing some phase of New ork
1 city life and making a careful study of it.
' Mrs. Smith's subject was the Police
Courts and their relation to the poor,
, watching especially the treatment of the
' poor and of the juveniles who come up
before the Judges. The entire work of
I the school Is of such a practical and bene
ficial Hort that it is sure to be continued
I and its example followed in other large
: cities.
From September to February Mrs.
Smith was at Wellealey College, Massa
: chusetts. where she delivered courses of
! lectures and at the same time investigated
various New England Institutions, es
'â  pecially those about Boston, in the same
manner as In New York. During the re
i mainder of the year she was at Cornell
! University, studying social statistics with
! Professor Walter wilcox, who has re
â  cently been appointed expert statistician
to the United States Census.
Mrs. Smith has returned early to finish
a work on social statistics which will be
published this fall by the â  American In
stitute of Statistics.
Mrs. Smith Ib a member and director of
â  the San Francisco Settlement Association,
| and the results of her study In the East
I will probably find application in the work
| of the association.

manifestations overhead all day two
brisk showers fell this afternoon shortly
before 6 o'clock. Rainfall at this time of
year caused the "oldest inhabitants" to
Jog rhoii memory for a recollection of a
similar occurrence. There was a general
apprehension lest the showers would work
an injury to such crops a.* remain unhar
vepted. Reports from the country were,
however, reassuring. Some grain will
shell and In other localities it will re
quire a few days' sun upon the fields to
dry the grain before harvest can he pro
ceeded with. On the lowlands and islands
which are being devastated by peat flres
the rtin will be a great benefit, as it was

CALL, HEADQUARTERS. WEL
LINGTON HOTEL, WASHINGTON,
Aug. 3.â Six of the ten new volunteer
regiments are recruited to nearly their
full complement. Returns received at
the War Department up to last night
show a total force of 9052, leaving less
than 5000 men yet to be enlisted.
This is the way each regiment stands
up to last returns: Twenty-sixth In
fantry, Plattsburg Barracks, 1124;
Twenty-seventh Infantry, Camp
Meade* . 1366; Twenty-eighth, Camp
Meade. 1049; Twenty-ninth, Fort Mc-
Pherson, 516; Thirtieth, Fort Sheridan v
1166; Thirty-first, Fort Thomas, 1352;
Thirty-second, Fort Leavenworth, 1034;
Thirty-third, Fort Sam Houston, 405;
Thirty-fourth, Fort Logan, 601; Thirty
fifth, Vancouver Barracks, 167; For
regiments recruiting in the Philippines,
253.
There has been a slight falling off in
the number of recruits during the past
few days and in order to make sure
i that all the regiments are filled within
j the allotted time, additional recruiting
j officers are being sent to the rural dis
tricts to hurry work along, especially
for those regiments which are slowly
; filling up. Three of the regiments
which are now practically full will be â 
ordered to San Francisco from their I
present stations about August 20.- The j
transports Grant, Sherman and Sheri
dan, which are now en route from the j
Philippines, are expected to be available
for these troops during the first week in
I September. Arrangements are being
perfected to have other transports
ready for the rest of the volunteers
within ten days thereafter. When the
full number of men have been secured
to complete the organization of the ten
| new regiments being enlisted in the
! United States and the three General
I Otis is recruiting in the Philippines the :
army of the United States will com
prise about 83,000 men.
The President will then have an op
portunity to appoint an additional brig
adier general. At the present time he
has the names of Colonel Sanger of the
Inspector General's Department and
Colonel Williston of the Third Artil- |
lery, who is now in the Philippines, un
der consideration for the place. He
will not make a decision, however, for
! some time, as it is thought not unlikely j
that something may develop in the J
Philippines to bring one of the officers j
i there to the front in a way which will .
j entitle him to recognition at the hands
i of the President.
ROOSEVELT UPHOLDS
PHILIPPINE POLICY
OCEAN GROVE, N. J.. Aup. 3.â Before
the Summer School of Theology to-night
Governor Theodore Roosevelt spoke on
the subject of "Practical Politics and De
cent Politics." In speaking of the ad
ministration's attitude In the Philippines
he said:
We put our pick Into the solid foundations of
Spanish government, both In the East and
West Indies. We tumbled the building down
In as righteous a war as ever was undertaken.
Now if we are to reach our place- among the
rreat nations of the earth we must see that
th<Â» ruins are cleared away and the temples of
justice and honesty reared in their places. We
Bhall be guilty of a terrible wrong to humanity
If in the Philippines we retreat before armed
savagery instead of organizing a suitable gov
ernment which shall guarantee justice to
every one and an ever-tncreasln* measure at
liberty to those who show themselves worthy
of It. The whole history of the world shows
that the wrong done by the mere sentimentalist
is often of larger proportions and more elastic
than any other kind of wrong, and of this kind
of wrong we shall be guilty If we fail to do
our task thoroughly and well. It will call for
but the mere fraction of our strength, provided
only we ohoose to exert that strength. If,
however, the pwple let their representative? in
Congress hamper the administration as they did
laFt winter whan they refused to put the army
upon a proper footing as to size, permanence

j T riJH a candor and unanimity that cannot fail to give weight to their opinions the volun
1/1/ teers returning from the Philippines declare that the islands which have already cost so much
blood and treasure are not worth having. The gallant men of the First Nebraska Regi
ment are even more emphatic in belittling our new possessions than are the Oregonians, who were
the first to give expression to their views on the islands and their treacherous inhabitants. They say
thai the small portion of the fond not held by the church is not available, for the present at least, far
agriculture, and that even if it were it is unfitted for the purposes for which it had been fondly hoped
it could be made a source of profit, namely the raising of American cereals, cattle and Hogs. The
heavy rains are almost always immediately followed by hot weather, which would rust such crops as
wheat and oats, and while corn is raised in large quantities it is of a very inferior quality.
The Chinese, who do most of the work in the fields â ivork that a white man could not do â are
overpaid at 50 cents a day, say these critics. The general belief is that our labor laws could not be ap
plied with profit to a country so dependent upon coolie labor, andihat with labor laws for the pro
tection of free workmgmen they could not compete with the low-class natives and Chinese, ez'en if
they could live in that climate, which is impossible except as gentlemen of leisure. Of the Filipinos.
who, when the islands are formally annexed to the United States, may rightfully claim the benefits of
the citizenship enjoyed by us, the soldiers, almost without exception, declare they will not be fitted for
that responsibility for several generations at least.
These are the opinions of men wlw are intelligent and educated and the majority of whom are
familiar with agriculture and therefore competent to judge of the conditions with which they were
brought face to face.

lated. There is plenty of land, but
whether there are any opportunities for
obtaining it for agriculture, I do not
knew. Americans cannot labor in the
fields or do hard work of any kind in that
climate. The natives and the Chines?
coolies form the laboring class. I could
not say what would be the effect of sub
stituting our labor laws for the system
of contract labor at present in vogue in
the islands. I think a white man soon
loses his energy to a great extent in that
climate. Ido not think the Filipinos
should be made citizens of the United
States.
PRIVATE A. ROTH, Company Iyâ The
Philippines are not in need of any more !
population: they are pretty well occupied :
now. There are no facilities for obtaining
land for agricultural purposes at the
present time that I know of. American I
agriculture might be introduced there, but
that is a question' I could not answer posi- j
tively. Corn of a rather poor grade is j
grown in considerable quantities, , but
I could not say whether wheat and oats |
could be raised. Americans cannot labor
there in our form of agriculture. All
hard work is done by the natives and
cooliesâ principally the latter. Our labor j
laws could not be introduced there with 'â 
profit to this country. The climate is j
very enervating and people of our race |
soon lose their energy. I am emphatically
opposed to the Filipinos being made citi- j

first.
PRIVATE C. H. KLEINHEN (Musi

THE OATMEAL
KING WAS AN
ARDENT WOOER
His Persistence Won
Miss Zipperlen.
All day yesterday Ferdinand Schu
macher, the aged oatmeal king, and nis
youthful bride were kept busy answering
the many telegrams of congratulation
that kept pouring in on them from all
over the East. Among the felicitations
was a wire from the family of the bride,
who learned by means of the dispatches
that Mary Zipperlen had wedded the
Ohio millionaire.
Schumacher was buoyantly happy be
cause the world knew of his great joy.
but Mrs. Schumacher was depressed at
what she considered the undue notoriety
given the nuptials. "If I had known there
would be all this publicity giver, our mar
riage I would never have married you,"
she said In teasing tones to her white
haired husband. And he with a great
love lisht shining in his faded old eyes
grabbed her in his arms and cried: "Oh,
yes you would; I would have made you."
On the Ist of July Schumacher joined
the Marshall party of thirty-five tourists
for a Western tour and invited his niece.
Miss Dora Schumacher, and her friend.
Miss Zipperlen, to accompany him. The
man of many millions had a purpose in
taking the trip, and it was more than a
desire to see the Western country.
"It was this way, 1 " said Schumacher.
"Since February I had been thinking of
making Miss Zipperlen my wife. I had
not seen the lady for more than six
years, though we corresponded regularly.
I finally concluded that a pleasant way
to see "if we were suited to one another
would be to travel together. We left Chi
cago on the Ist of July. 'I respect and
honor you,' she said, but the rest of the
fair lady's answer must ever be unknown,
for the "fair lady herself put out a sooth-

liable to rust. There are some cattle and
hogs, but the cattle-raising industry does
not flourish. I do not think that Ameri
cans could work there in our form of
agriculnire. All the hard work is done
by the Chinese and natives. I could not
say what the effect would be If our labor
laws were extended to the islands. The
climate is extremely enervating and soon
saps the energy of people of our race. I
do not think the Filipinos should be made
citizens of the United States.
PRIVATE E. W. CROOK. Company Lâ
I do not thln^c the Philippines are at all
lacking in population and I do not think
there is any scarcity of land there, but in
regard to obtaining land for agricultural
purposes I would say there are at present
no opportunities at all. The soil is ap
parently rich and all kinds of cereals
might be made to grow there, with the
possible exception of wheat and oats.
Cattle and hogs do not flourish. It is no
country for an American laboring man.
Whites soon become enervated in that
climate and they cannot work in the
fields or at hard labor. That kind of work
is all done by the natives and the Chinese.
The latter appear to stand the climate
best. I do not think the country would
be profitable to the United States if our
labor laws were extended to the islands
and contract labor forbidden. I do not
think the native Filipinos should be made
citizens of the United States with privi
leges equal to ours.
CORPORAL. G. M. BOYTON. Company
Mâ The prospect for white men in the
Philippines while poor is not quite as
bad as pictured. The land is fertile and
extremely productive. I think cotton
might be raised successfully by the na
tives, but it would be a rather hard mat
ter for a white man to attempt to get rich
â¢iff the products of the soil. A capitalist
might increase his fortune, but a laboring
man, no matter how poor, is better oft
in this country. I think the mining pros
pects are good. At Caloocan we washed
gold right in the trenches. While the cli
mate is not suited to the people of our
race, it can be endured.
T don't want the world to know. It is
our secret."
Mr. Schumacher never told, but In the
conversation â which followed it transpired
that the millionaire was an a.rdent wooer
and that it was his persistence that won
him his wife.
"And that is the first and only time I
obeyed him, or intend to obey," said Mrs.
Schumacher. "He insisted we be married
right away. I wanted to wait till we got
back home, but Mr. Schumacher was per
sistent, and when he told me he was old
and had no time to lose I consented.
Sunday morning we went to church and
went and heard Dr. Locke preach. I de
â ?iiled there and then that he was the
minister that should marry us."
"It was a lovely ceremony," said Schu
macher.
"Perfectly lovely," said Mrs. Schu
macher. "I never promised to obey."
The oatmeal king and his bride have
as yet made no plants for the future. Miss
Dora Schumacher will return to her East
<?rn home when her tourist ticket expires,
September 4, but her uncle and his wife
will Btay on indefinitely.
"I have always wanted to spend a win
ter In California." said Mrs. Schumacher,
"and we may stay here until next spring.
But nothing Is definite. I have not yet
decided."
"She has not yet decided," echoed the
new husband, "and until Mrs. Schu
macher does decide. " he added, "our plans
are necessarily indefinite."

! CORPORAL W. F. DOUGHERTY, |
; Company LâThe country is thickly pop
' ulated. The land seems to be all taken !
up. It is either owned by the Filipinos or
big syndicates. Very little of the country
seems unoccupied. Corn and rice are the .
only cereals that grow well there. Other
; products are likely to be ruined by the
' wet weather and dry season. The Ameri
cans could not work in the field as they
I do in this country, as the heat is too ,
1 great. The Chinese seem to do the most '
I work. It would be a fine thing and a help
to this country if our laws were intro
duced there, especially the labor laws.
The climate Is not suited to a white man.
, The Filipinos have been fighting all their
lives and will never make good citizens.
. In my opinion, they should never be al
: lowed" the same privileges. It will take
a long time for the natives to become
educated up to our form of government. '
When they do they will make good citi- j
zens.
PRIVATE LEMISON, Company Lâ
There does not seem to be a scarcity of
population in the Philippines. It is rather
difficult to say whether it would be pos
sible for an American to gain possession :
|of land. It all seems to be occupied and
is held by the church. The soil is just
right for the raising of corn, rice and to
â  bacco. As to wheat and rye. I am unable
j to say whether they could be raised with
j out loss. The intense heat and the wet
1 weather would seem to be against the
latter products. I do not think the Fili
pinos should be made citizens of the
United States.
PRIVATE J. E. DOYLE, Company D â
The islands are thickly populated. I sup
i pose a man could buy land if he had the
"Money. I do not think much wheat couli
be raised there, as it is too wet. Corn,
rye and barley could be raised without
trouble. Cattle and hogs would thrive,
' but there is danger of the hogs taking tho
disease that is prevalent in the lsi&nds.
The climate is such that it takes
; the energy out of a man. After an Amer
: ican is there a few months he does not
want to do anything. The Chinese and
natives do most of the hard labor. The
i islands would be profitable if our labor
laws w<:-re introduced there. I do not
think the climate is suited to our race.
! The heat makes them indolent. They lose
' their energy and ambition. 1 don't think
i the natives should be made citizens. In
course of time they might have to be,
but that is too far off to worry over.
! SERGEANT HALL, Company Xâ From
! my observations, the islands seemed to
have plenty of population. There is very
I little chance of getting land there, as it
â  is either settled or the Catholics have it in
' control. Almost any product save wheat
could be raised on the islands. Cattle and
hogs would certainly do well. The Fili
; pinos seem to do most of the labor and
â  are better acclimated. It would be the
best thing for the islands if American
laws and ideas were introduced. The
! climate is too warm and is a drawback
to many who might want to settle there.

CANADIANS DISPLAY
LACK OF SPORTSMANSHIP
DORVALE. Quebec, Aur. 3.â A series of
five races for the Seawanhka cup between
the American challenger Constance and
the Canadian defender Glencairn 111
terminated this evening in a fiasco. Each
of the little craft had won two races and
the boats were called to-day for the de
cisive brush, but Skipper Duggan sailed
his Canadian boat over the course alone,
and was awarded the cup despite the pro
tests of Mr. Craig, the American.
The Glencairn 111 crossed the starting
line at 3:05:15, but theÂ»Constance did not
cross, her centerbcard^having struck the
ground while her skipper was maneuver
ing for the start. Then followed Mr.
Craig's verbal protest, but the officials
decided to continue the race and consider
the protest afterward.
By this time the Glencairn 111 was well
up the first leg, and a small yacht was sent
up to Instruct her to complete the course.
The Glencairn 111 accordingly proceeded,
snd with the moderate wind which was
blowing finished the twelve miles at
6:25:15, well within the live-hour time
limit.
Mr. Craig's verbal protest was followed
by a wrftten protest by Mr. Post, part
owner of the Constance, to the effect *hat
the course was not a proper one for the
boats to sail on. The sailing committee
after being In session from 8:30 o'clock
until 11:20 to-night decided that the race
Bhould bÂ« awarded to thÂ« Glencairn IIL
I think the Filipinos will be all right
after the Americans secure a foothold. In
my opinion, the natives will make good
citizens in course of time, but they will
have to be educated up to it.
SERGEANT C. C. KAUFFMAN, Com
pany Câ The Philippines, and especially
Luzon, are not lacking in population by
! any means. I do not know what the op
portunities for securing land for agricul
i tural purposes are, but I understand it is
nearly all owned by the church. There ia
no doubt that wheat, oats, rye. barley
and other cereals can be raised there.
! Corn is already raised in large quantities.
I Cattle and hogs nourish and are a source
of considerable profit. Americans cannot
do any kind of hard out of door work
there, as they cannot stand the climate.
; All work in the fields is done by either
Chinese coolies or natives, although the
j latter are not partial to labor of any kind.
! I do not think the islands would be a
I source of profit if the contract labor sys
\ tern was abolished and* our labor laws
enforced there. The Filiptnos would not
make good citizens, not for generations
', at least.
PRIVATE J. W. WHITTAKER, Com
; pany Câ l don't know anything about the
j other islands, but Luzon is in no need of
more population. There are no opportunl
i ties at present for obtaining land for
agricultural purposes so far as I know,
but of course there may be after the
fighting is over. I think a grreat many
American 'agricultural products could be
, raised there successfully, and cattle and
i hogs appear to thrive. All the work in
! the fields Is done by Chinese coolies t nd
natives. Americans could not do the
work because of the climate. Our labor
laws could not replace the present sys
; tern of servile and contract labor in vogue
| there with profit. The Chinese work po
| cheap that white men could not compete
j with them. I do not think the native
j Filipinos should be made citizens of the
j United States until they have been civi
j lized, and that will not be for several
generations.
PRIVATE MORRIS R. WHITEHEAD,
Company Hâ The Philippines do not ap
pear to be lacking is population. It is a
| great agricultural country, but there are
! no opportunities for getting land there
' now. I cannot say how it will be after
the fighting is ove^ I think crops such as
! corn, wheat, etc.. can be raised there and
American agricultural methods introduc
â¢ed to some extent. Cattle and hogs ap
! pear to do well. Americans cannot work
, out of doors there. The most of the work
| in the fields is performed by Chinese coo
! lies. I do not think our labor laws could
' be enforced there, as the Chinese and the
â  natives are the only ones who can do the
work. The climate is unsuited to white
: men, as it saps the vitality. I do not
1 think the Filipinos should ever be made
i citizens of the United States with equal
i privileges to ours. As soon as they get
i a little education they are the worst ty-

miles and considering the heavy track
the time was very fast.
Ananias won the 2:07 pace in straight
heats and apparently without effort. The
Cleveland horse was favorite in the bet
ting, but Miss Logan was heavily backed
on the strength of her having wor at
Cleveland last week. The llrst hc-at whs
paced before the rain and there was not
one of the horses in the big field trat
could crowd Ananias. Charlie X followed
Ananias down the stretch ahead nf the
bunch and finished second by two lengths
The judges thought James had not driven
Charlie B out and the gelding was Bet
back to twelfth place after having finished
second.
There were twenty-one starters Jn the
2:13 pace, two heats of which were paced
before the rain. Harry O was favorite
In the betting, but had a formidable com
petitor In Nerva Patchen. Harry O fin
ished eleventh in tbe flrgt heat and then
won in consecutive heats. Nerva -Patchtn
was driven out in the first heat, but Â«aye

in the next two heats. In the last heat

STAKE BOOK SOON TO BE OUT
SAUSALITO POOLROOM PROPRIE
TORS AT OUTS.
Johnny Humphrey WithdrawsâHan
dicapper Brooks in Town â Santa
Rosa Betting Privilege
Open to Bidders.
Work on the track of the new Western
Turf Association at San Bruno is pro
gressing and its stake book, It is said,
is in the printer's hand*. The California
Jockey Club will not issue its list of
stakes to be competed for at the next
meeting for a month at least. Both rac
ing organizations will probably diminish
instead of increase the number of atakes
heretofore offered for 2-year-olds, and
possibly some of those for horses of the
all-aged division. From a spectacular
standpoint the 2-year-old stake events
last season, witfi a possible exception or
two, were lamentably poor affairs. A
thousand dollar handicap hung up every
Saturday would prove a much stronger
drawing card and please the horsemen
better.
Dissensions have sprung up among the
poolroom men of Sausalito, as a result of
which Johnny Humphrey, the well-known
loca! layer or odds, is no longer a member
of the 'combine. Some weeks ago the
rooms were winners to the extent of over
$40,000. and as business is now a trifle
dull no doubt John was quite willing to
"break away."
J. W. Brooks, hanciicapper and clerk of
the scales for the California Jockey Club,
who has "been spending the greater por
tion of his vacation in his Tennessee
home, is again in California. Mr. Brooks
arrived on Tuesday and is ready to again
don the harness,
"Jack" Atkin of the firm of Atkin &
Lottridge, arrived from St. Louis early
during the present work. Jack was block
man for "Joe" Rose at the fair grounds
meeting. The latter pendler is now book
ing at Saratoga.
From recent accounts "Dick" Clawson s
days of usefulness in the saddle are num
bered. He has grown until he is now
nearly as tall, as Henry Shields, and has
taken most affectionately to plunging on
the races.
owing to dissatisfaction the director? of
the Pacific Coast Trotting Horse Breed
â¢ rs 1 Association have again opened the
bids for the coming meeting to be held at
Santa Rosa. On< bid of $1600 for the
I. onking privilege was received, but as an
other guarantee of $2200 was made for the
auction and parts mutuel betting, with
out books, it was concluded to give the
bookmakers a chance to raise the ante.
Pete Mitchell, who formerly trained
Rienzl. Rose Clark and other well-known
Performers, now has charge of the stock
farm of Sf-nator R. Porter Ashe at Glen
Ellen. Storm King and Governor Shoe
han, owned by Nathan Landsberg, the
Chicago turfman, are being summered at
t ills establishment.
The 2:03J4, 2:Q4Â£, 2:04 made by Search

McHenry is a gooa prognostlcator. Dur-
Ing the June meeting ai Denver, where
Searchlight stepped a mile In 2:05, creat
ing a new track record, McHenry said:
"He'll beat 2:'i2 before the season is Over."

NO FIGHTS IN DENVER.
Mayor Johnson Vetoes the Ordinancs
Licensing Contests.
DENVER, Aug. 3.â Mayor Johnson to
day vetoed the ordinance placing the li
cense for athletic clubs which conduct
sparring contests at $1500. In his message
the Mayor said:
"I am unwilling to approve an ordinance
which should make It possible to have
repeated in Denver such a brutal contest
us was witnessed in this city about one
week ago at one of these so-called athletic
associations."
It is not likely that the ordinance can
be passed over his veto.

Shortenders in Front.
Magnet succeeded In capturing the mid
week reserve stake for non-winners at
Vnion Coursing Park yesterday, after an
Interesting course with Bonnie Scotland.
Magnet led to the hare and performed the
lirst part of the work. Then there were
a few exchanges and Bonnie commenced
to wipe out Magnet's lead but killed too

A fine day's sport was enjoyed by a falr-
I Bizert crowd. The hares w.ere unusually
strong- and several escaped. There were
two exceptionally hard courses, necessi
tating the withdrawal of the winners. In
the third round lowa Girl beat Master
piece after a hard struggle. In the fourth
round Alma lost whatever chances she
might have had to win the stake by a
grueling course with Expense. Alma did
nil the work and another dog was let
loose, but the hare escaped.

FINANCIAL PANIC FEARED.
Unsound Speculation Weakens the
German Money Market.
BERL.IN, Aug. 3.â The Deutsche Tapes
Zeituns to-day publishes a sensational
article predicting a great panic in the
German money market. The paper said
that during the last six months 1.090,
--000,000 of new shares were issued, of which ;
518,000.000 marks were industrial securi
ties, which it is alleged exceeds the whole

A mass of evidence is quoted to prove i
the existence of unsound speculation.
OAKLAND BANTAMS
FIGHT TO FINISH
OAKLAND. Aug. 3.â There was a prize
fight to a finish to-night in the center of |
the city, and by a clever ruse the police
were prevented from interfering. Jake
Baumgarten, a well-known young |
bantam-weight, who has often fought at i
the Acme and Reliance clubs, knocked out !
a young colored fellow known about town
as Musa. There has been bad blood be- I
tween the two young boxers for some !
time, and last night at the gentlemen's
night of the Acme Club the quarrel came >
to a head and they decided to settle it
at the first opportunity.
A crowd of sports agreed to put up a
purse of $10. and to-night Baumgarten
and Musa met in the cellar under the
shaving parlor at Seventh and Broadway.
Everything was well arranged and well
known sports acted as timekeeper and
referee.
When time was called the two bantams
flew at each other and science was
superseded by anger. For about a minute
blows fell thick and fast. Jake landed
where he pleased, but he could havp
smashed his knuckles on Musa' a head
without any result to his antagonist, who
lacked courage. Musa was big enough to
have won. and did very well so long as
Jake let his stomach alone, but when
Baumgarten was advised to go for his
opponent's body the end came quickly.
Musa received two stiff punches in tho
stomach and lay down completely sense
less. Fear seized the crowd that he had \
been killed, and some one threw a bucket j
of ice-water over him. This brought him
to just as the police arrived and were in
formed that a shaving contest had been !
waged. Hearing this Detective Holland
was satisfied and left. The mill was very
vicious while It lasted and Baumgarten
was given the purse. No arrests were
made, as when the police returnr'l later
the crowd had dispersed and the officers
were informed that the lads had merely
boxed with eight-ounce gloves and that
no one had been badly hurt. The fight '
was witnessed by many of the leading
merchants and attorneys on Broadway.
Late to-night one of the officers of the
Reliance Club complained to the police of
the affair, saying that it should not be
allowed, as the fight took place on a :
cement floor and in a dark basement. He |
said that If anybody had been seriously
injured or killed it would have given the
legitimate sport a setback that it would
not recover from for years. Chief Hodg- i
kins will make a thorough investigation. ;

l\ Explanation of the New System of Electrical Treat-
o ment and Reasons for Its Great Success.
O The Dr. McLaughlin method is a special means of applying electric-
' ity to the body, adopted by myself after twenty years of close study and
y experiment. I use the current in a mild, continuous stream, generating
w it from a body, battery, which Is worn about the waist while the pa-
j tient sleeps. The object of the system is to replace that wonderful vital
â¢ force in the bodies of the sick and weak, so that it will stay there. I
I have found out how to do this and my thousands of grateful patients
j attest my success.
â¢ , CURES PAINS IN A DAY. Thousands of people have pains which
are the result of. a waste of strength and other symptoms of debility
" from the same cause. ' When my method is followed the body is filled
Â£ with electricity every night while the patient is sleeping peacefully,
I and this electricity generates a new force in the nerves, adds warmth
w and vigor to the stomach and liver and assists the circulation, so that
I new life is given to fill parts of the body and perfect health follows, j
w WHY IT CURES. It cures because it restores strength, and where
| there is vitality there can be no pain, no weakness, no trouble. It fills
Â£ every part of the body with new strength and assures perfect health.

HULL'S WIFE
LEFT HOME IN
FEAR OF DEATH
Police Officer Sued for
Maintenance.
If the allegations of Mrs. Sarah E. S.
Hall arc based on facts the conduct of
Officer Charles H. Hall, her husband,
should be thoroughly investigated by tho
Police Commissioners. Mrs. Hall tiled
suit yesterday against her husband lor
maintenance, the basis for the action be
ing fully set forth in her complaint.
â â¢On the 3d day of July." the complaint
reads, "the defendant willfully deserted
the plaintiff by then and there causing the
plaintiff. Mrs. Hall, to depart from tne
family place by reason of his cruel treat
ment of and acts toward plaintiff. By
reason of the acts of Officer Hall the
plaintiff apprehended that defetida nt
would do her great and lasting bodily
threatened to throw plain
tiff out of the family dwelling place if she
did not leave, and threatened to chop ncr
to pieces, at the same time exhibiting ana
menacing plaintiff with a large dirk
knife, and at numerous times used vio
lent and opprobrious language towanl
plaintiff, too vulgar to be here pleaded.
Mrs. Hall further says that during their
married life, since May 19, 1877. sfie has
been uniformly kind to her husband, and
his acts, threats and cruelty were with
out cause or provocation on her part She
says that she is without money or mean*
with which to support herself or to prose
cute the action, and hence asks a decree
of court compelling her husband to pay
her $150 counsel fees. $75 costs and $50 a
month hereafter as alimony for her main
tenance and support.
The complaint is verified under oath by
Mrs. Hall, and hence the actions of Hall
will doubtless receive the attention of tho
Commissioners.
MERCHANTS WANT
A BRANCH MUSEUM
MANY ADVANTAGES TO WEST
ERN BUSINESS MEN.
W. P. Wilson of the Philadelphia
Institution Offers Great Induce
ments to San Francisco.
The proposition of the Merchants' Asso
ciation to establish in this city a branch
of the Philadelphia Commercial Museum
i Is attracting not a little attention on the
| part of the exporters, merchants and
: manufacturers. The advantages of hav
ing such a bureau of information becomes
' more apparent every clay. As a fact the
movement was started nearly a year ago,
i when C. A. Green, assistant chief of the
1 bureau of information of the National
Museum was in this city. He went to the
i Orient, where he obtained over three tons
! of the principal products of China, Japan
i and tho Philippine Islands, which he sent
to the headquarters in the East. Besides
j the exhibits he collected all the data and
i Information that went with the goods.
Upon his return he talked the matter
1 over with J. A. Filcher, manager of the
' State Board of Trade, with a view r,f
i learning the Wishes of the people as in
establishing a branch hrre. He also in
terviewed C. A. Denicke, who was very
i enthusiastic in his support of the propo
i Eition. As Mr. Green was not authorized
:to act, nothing was done at the time. It
i was not long after that when the Mc
i chanics' Institute went to the head of
I a movement to obtain from the United
i States Government an appropriation of
I $50,000 for a permanent exhibit in this
' city of the raw and manufactured prod
â  ucts of the world and the compiling of
, euch information concerning the same as
i would be of service to the commerce of
the coast. This fell through on account
of the matter being Drought up in Con
; gress so close to the close of that body's
b< -sion.
The project was of such importance that
, it was not doomed to die, and recently,
1 when several of the members of the amo
-1 elation were in Philadelphia, they dis
cussc-d it again with WÂ« P. Wilson, the
manager of the museum. The latter is In
favor of having a separate institution
here, arguing that a branch of the Na
! tional Museum will be of special benefit to
I the West. In the first place, much of the
j surplus goods of the parent exhibit could
! be sent to this city, but more Important
: still is the furnishing of the information,
! data, prices, changes, supply, etc., of all
I kinds of goods and commodities of this
! and foreign countries. All this would be
furnished in duplicate to the museum
here. Mr. Wilson states that while the
Philadelphia museum is able to attend
to all of the business of the world, it
would be greatly benefited by having a
branch in San Francisco.
The reason is that this being the ex
treme western part of the commercial
i centers of the Union a branch here would
! be in closer touch with the commercial
| Interests of the Orient and Central and
I South America than the Quaker City. A3
a fact, the name "Philadelphia Commer
cial Museum" is often misleading. The
body is a national and not a local insti
tution, and its interests lie in every part
of the United States. As soon as the
Merchants' Association gets the tax levy
and election off its hands It will take up
the matter of establishing the branch
j museum here.NO SPREAD OF

SOURCE OF DISEASE TRACED
BROUGHT BY A VETERAN" FROM
SANTIAGO.
He Has Since Gone to Columbus City,
Washington â Arrangements for
the Removal of
Troops.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Aug. -3.â The marine
hospital officials at Hampton Roads have j
succeeded in tracing and locating the for
mer Inmate of the liers' Home who is i
believed to have brought yellow fever to
that place. His name Is William Thomas.
He arrived at the home on a transport
from Santiago, where he had been visiting j
from July 2 to 5 last. He was admitted j
to the home as a veteran and soon, after !
developed chills and fever. In the light j
of subsequent events the experts believe ;
there is little doubt that he was afflicted j
with a mild case of yellow fever, although
it was not diagnosed as such at the time.
When well enough to travel he left the
home and his baggage was sent to Phoe
bus. Then he went to â¢ lumbus City,
Wash., where he now is.
Surgeon General Wyman regards it as i
fortunat<- that Thomas went to such a J
high altitude, as it lessens any danger
cf'infeetion.
Regarding the probable duration of the ]
present epidemic Dr. Wyman said to-day:
"It is yet too early to make predictions j
as to the suppression of the olubreak,
only fcur days having elapsed since the
discovery of the fever. Ihe fact that
Thomas, the original suspect, has gone
north, takes considerable weight off our
minds, as he is now in a latluide where ;
there is no chance of yellow â¢â¢ver doing
great damage. Our past experience, ;
though, has shown that yellow fever can !
be suppressed and confined to the original"
focus of infection when the precautions ;
are .ken early enough in the outbreak.
This . as shown at Brunswick, Ga.. in
.
"It -was also true in the outbreaks at
McHenry, Miss., and Franklin, La. In the
latter â¢two epidemics there were other I
outbreaks In Mississippi and Louisiana \
about the - mi time, but there is good
reason to believe the â  ction was car
ried to the outlying points before the j
quarantine of the original focus was put j
in fox-ce. We believe the quarantine pre- i
cautions as now enforced in the South are
effective. Where there has been appar- |
ently a spread through the official lines ;
it has been due to tardy information of :
the outbreaks. This shows the necessity
of prompt reports in all cases."
It was finally decided this afternoon
that the garrison at Fort Monroe shall j
be taken away on the Government trans- !
port McClellan, which will Leave New
York to-night and arrive at the fort to
morrow. __________

SECRETARY WILSON
LEAVES FOR HOME
HIS VISIT MAY MEAN MUCH TO
CALIFORNIA FARMERS.
The Head of the Department of Agri
culture Makes Pertinent Criti
cisms on the Dairy Industry.
Secretary of Agriculture James Wilson
returned yesterday from Los Angeles and
departed this morning for Nevada en
route tv his home in Washington, D. C.
He expressed himself as much pleased by
the reception which has been accorded
him by the people of this State, and
â  I many eulogiums on the resources
of California and its general adaptability
to all classes of agricultural industry.
The reason of the' Secretary's visit to
the southern part of the State was not
only to acquaint himself in a general way
with the agricultural conditions of the
country, but was taken with the par
ticular purpose of meeting a number of
scientific foresters that were sent out here
by his department to report on the con
ditions of the woods of this State.
"This forestry question is of pressing
importance," said the Secretary last
evening. "The woods are being destroyed
too rapidly. Some of the best scientists
of the department in this particular line
are now oat here studying the application
of water to fuel. Of course they have not
yet made their report, and my trip to
Los Angeles was to acquaint myself in a
feneral way with what some of them are
oing. But I am confident that when they
do make their report it will be found to
contain much information which will be
of inestimable value to those engaged In
the lumber business and all pertaining
the ret' ).
"]n the valleys of California I find the
farmers giving some attention to dairy
ing, but they are not devoting to that
industry anything like the energy it de
mands. When 1 wanted to send butter,
cheese and i-e;, r = to China I found that the
State had nothing to export. Now this
stair- of things should not exist. The
beet pulp fiom your sugar factories
should be utilized for feeding purposes
nu(\ nothing that I know of produces
bettor milk and richer butter than this
same pulp. If this was done the land that
Is now uspd for grazing would be given
to the production of dairy produce and
the returns from that industry would in
a short time grow to an amount that
would make you open your eyes in amaze
in fâ¢ n t . ' "
Yesterday, the Secretary's last day in
California, was spent by him in receiv
ing the visits of personal friends and in
inspecting the agricultural experimental
station in Berkeley, It is the intention
of Secretary Wilson' to repeat his vi.sit

A CHINESE RUSE.
Novel Means Employed by a Society
to Collect Dues.
A See Tup Society has adopted a novel
means of collecting duos from delinquent !
members. About three days ago circulars
were posted threatening members with
arrest if they did not produce $1 50, which
is the amount of dues exacted by the so
ciety. The trouble arose from the fact
that certain Chinese have been in the
habit of d. -parting for the Celestial King
dom, leaving an unpaid due bill behind.
The society now has agents stationed at
all out-going steamers whose duty it is to
see that all members of the tong have a
receipt for $1 50 in their possession. Ac- I
cording to the circular, which has caused
much commotion in Chinatown, should
any of the Chinamen attempt to evade
his dues he will be immediately placed
under arrest. The proclamation is cal- J
culated to frighten the runaway delin- !
quent and is opposed by many members
of the society.

PRIEST'S DEPARTURE
GRIEVES CONVICTS
Inmates of San Quentin Send a
Touching Testimonial to
Father Lagan.
SAN QUENTIN PRISON, Aug. 3.â
When Rev. Hugh Lagan departed for San
Francisco to assume the pastorate of
Sacred Heart parish he was given a re
ception at the Hall Rafael, where several
prominent citizens paid the popular priest
a well-deserved eulogy for his broad
minded policy in both civic and religious
affairs. He was presented with two testi
monials, one written and the other of a
more substantial nature.
From the convicts at the penitentiary
comes another testimonial â one from the
men he has comforted in the* hour of their
adversity and sorrow. It is written not
in smooth, flowing phrase and the page
does not scintillate with the jewels of
language, but its meaning and the sorrow
of the prisoners at the loss of the priest
is so plain that the document has not
failed to strike a responsive chord in the
hearts of those who have been permitted
to read it. The. testimonial was en
grossed by a convict forger, who is an
expert penman, and reads in part as fol
lows:
CALIFORNIA STATE PRISON.-

have brought our trials and trouhlea to you
constantly through the entire period of your
ministry here. In these years we have been
appreciative witnesses and recipients of your
bounty. In moments of direst need have you
Stood the rock upon which we might cast our
burdens, and In the sunshine of your goodness
and benlsrnlty we have risen from the llough
of de3pond and walked the path which leads to
good endeavor and attendant happiness. .
a We desire, dear father, to recall particularly
your work am, the condemned. Your per

BROKE ONE BIG
FIRM ONLY TO
FORM ANOTHER
Page, McCutcheon &
Eeils Dissolved.
THEY CAN MAKE MORE MONEY
LAWYERS BELIEVE IT IS BE
CAUSE OF THE TEVIS WILL.
In Order to Avoid Dividing" the Fee 3,
They Say, the Old Firm Was
Dissolved and the New
One Formed.
The law firm of Page, McCutcheon &
Eells has been dissolved, and in the sur
prise at the dissolution of a partnership
supposed to be a permanent one, the legal
fraternity is quietly smiling at what they
believe is the reason for the breakup. It
I was no common cause, the lawyers say;
' it was nothing less than a will and the
will of the millionaire, Lloyd Tevls, and
i so the fees would not be split up into too
many portions, the firm was quietly dis
solved and a new one was built upon its
asht-H. In the new one are Page; Mc-
Cutcheon, Harding and Knight. Harding
â  is Reinhart Harding of the old firm,
who. it is said, has been kept in a posi
tion much subordinate to ihat he held be
fore. Knight is Sam Knight. ex-Assistant
United States District Attorney. The men
who were left out in the cold are "Charles
i P. Eells, who for twenty years was a
: partner of Page in the old firm of Page
& Eells. and Michael N. Michael.
The firm of Page, McCutcheon & Eells
has been in existence for over four years. .
! It was formed by the introduction into
< the firm of Page & Eplls of Edward J.
McCutcheon, who had been with M. M.
ESstee for a long time. Eteinhart Harding
| was added later. It was always appar-
I ently a prosperous firm and appeared to
i do a great deal of good business, so when
' it was announced that the firm had dis
solved the question "why" was prominent
among the comments in legal circles.
Mr. Page's explanation of the dlssolu
' tion is that about three months ago Mc
i Cutcheon and hn decided that the mem-
I hers of the firm could make more money
I if it separated into individual members
and each went into business for himself.
"It was three months ago," he said last
i evening, "when Mr. McCutcheon and I
' reached this decision. When we had done ,
; po we passed a resolution dissolving the
i firm. No, we did not constitute a major
ity, but we passed a resolution dissolv
; ing the firm, and we got out. There is no
! truth in any story of dissensions among
| us. We parted on the best of terms.
â  We simply thought we could do better if
! we separated, and we separated. We took
Mr. Harding into our firm, and three
: months ago we spoke to Mr. Knight.
i There was then no thought of the Tevis
will. Mr. Tevis was not dead, nor have
we yet seen anything of the will. It has
not yet been opened and I have no knowl
edge whether or not we will get it. In
fact, I have no official -knowledge of the
, will at all."
It is just this official knowledge of the
Tevis will that has caused a legal smile
to light the faces of local lawyers. The
old firm had as a matter of fact no offl
! cial knowledge of the will, for the will
! will not be opened before the return of
! Mrs. Sharon from the East. It is under
i stood that McCutcheon will get the pre
j clous document to probate, but it has not
[ yet been given to him, so it Is not the
property of the present firm nor was It
the property of the old firm. Hence if the
firm dissolved It could not be said that
it was deprived of anything It never had,
and If then the will were turned over to |
McCutcheon the old firm would have no

OF UNION BANK
Five Per Cent Paid to
Depositors.

PATRONS TO GET FORTY CENTS
ON THE DOLLAR.
Throughout the Day a Crowd of
Men and Women Throngs
the Defunct Concern's
Building.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, Aug. 3.â The 5 per cent oivi
â lend on dspe-siis declared by the insolvent
I'niori Hp.nk was m.ide payable
to-day and chat institution was crowded
all da^ long by depositors anxious to re
cover what little they could frjui their
savings. Nearly six months :.'.s:o the bank
closed Its doors, and tr.is Is tUe first pay
mc-nt that has l>een made on the settle
ment of accounts. It amounts to but $5
en the $ICO, and it takes between $37,000
and fJS.'WO to pay the dividend in full.
About 500 depositors were paid to day,
and when the banU closed at 3 o'clock
thtre was still a crowd about the prem
ises. There are over 20<Xt depositors in all,
and it wili take several days to pay them.
The bank directors are now negotiating
for the sale of some valuable securities
held in San Francisco, and if the deal
goes through, it is claimed, another divi
dend of from 10 to 15 per cent veil, be
paid within two months.
The affairs of the bank are looking a
little brighter, but the directors admit
that the assets will not pay over -10
cents on the dollar. The depositors them
selves think they will be lucky if they
get but little more than this.
It is not thought much will be realized
from the assessments to be levied on the
stockholders. Two months ago an assess
ment of ?lu a share was levied, but so far
only a couple' of men have paid this as
sessment. The sale of stock to satisfy
this assessment was stopped by injunction
proceedings by the stockholders, Â»k It was
feared that through the bank bidding in
the stock the stockholders could rid them
selves of their pro rata liability.
Suit will shortly be commenced against
Myra E. and William H. Wright for the
recovery of the bank premises at the cor
ner of First and Fountain streets. Those
were deeded to Mrs. Wright for a loan
of $60,000. According to a decision of the
Attorney General the bank was a savings
institution and bad no right to transfer
its property. The building and ground
are worth $53,000. It is expected to re
cover securities pledged to San Francisco
banks under thjs decision.

New Pastor for Seattle.
MADIS<Â»N. â \Yis.. Aug. 3.â Rev. W. P.
Pimnnrls. pastor of the Unitarian Church
hnre. has accepted a call to Seattle,
Wash., and will take charge of the pas
torate there on October 1.
real objection coming. It would have no
fees coming either, which is an incident
in the case. It is this incident the legal
fraternity is saying that caused the disso
lution. One fee, however large, divided
among Page, McCntcheon, Sells, Harding
and Michael, all full partners, would not
amount to so much individually as the
same fee divided between Page and Mc-
Cutcheon, full partners, and Harding and
Knight, side partners.
Mr. Pag^ declares that the deal was
commenced three months ago. It was just
about the time Tevis was reported as be
ing very seriously ill. and so it could have
bad nothing whatever to do with his will,
for he had not died. The dissolution took
place about a week ago. according to Mr.
J'iigc. perhaps a day or so after the d^ath
of Tevis. which occurred on the night of
July 24. but the will had nothing to do
with it. It was simply because the '.inn
could make more money by separating
than by continuing on as it had been do
ing.
Michael was away on his vacation when
he received his notification of dissolu
tion. When he returned the letter was
waiting for him at the University Clnb.
It merely stated that the firm had been
dissolved, but it was hoped that fact
would not interfere with his vacation.
Mrs. Sharon is due to arrive h:-ir any
day. As soon as she appears the will wlfl
be" opened and then it will go to some
lawyer. The new firm has no i lea
whether or not it will get the testament,
but if it does, it being- an entirely new
organization, the old firm can have no
claims upon it.
OPIUM FACTORY SEIZED.
Special Internal Revenue Agent Burt M.
Thbmafl and posse seized a Chinese opium
factory at No. Ift Washington alley yes
terday. The inmates, except the cook,
fled by a rear passage before the officers
succeeded in gaining an entrance. The
factory was owned by Man Sing, and he
will be arrested as soon as he can be
found. No one except American citizens
are allowed to manufacture opium In the
United States, and even then must pay
a revenue tax of $10 per pound for the
privilege of making an article that can
be obtained for $2 per pound. In a panel
in the wall Deputy Collector Gilehrist
found seventy-five flve-tael tins of pre
pared opium ready for shipment.
Already Well Paid.
The judgment, and order of the lower
court of this city in the case of Peter W.
Watson against Eliza M. Miller, adminis
tratrix of the estate of A. P. More, de
ceased, was affirmed yesterday by the
Supreme Court. Watson sued to recover
$30,000, claimed to be due for work and
services to More during the two years
prior to his death. A complaint in inter
vention was filed by the two heirs and
the plaintiffs' demurrer was overruled.
Vpon the trial of the case judgment was
against the plaintiff. The lower court
found the services performed for More
were not valued at more than $."00 and
More had never agr-eri to pay Watson, as
the services were understood to be gra
tuitous and such as a broker usually so
renders for a customer doing business for
him. As a matter of fact, Watson had
been paid $500 in full for all services.

MARY CAVANAUGH
SWORE FOR HER LOVER
TOLD HOW HER BROTHER HAD
THREATENED HIM.
She Wore Mourning for the Dead
Man and Testified as to His Bad
Qualities and Criminal
Record.
Mary Cavanaueh wore mourning for her
brother at the Coroner's inriuest yester
day morning, but her testimony was in
favor of her paramour, the man who
slew him last Tuesday morning in a
saloon at the corner of Mason and Ellis
streets. Frank Connolly, a companion of
the dead man. gave equally favorable tes
timony, and the jury returned two ver
dicts, the majority of seven jurors sign
ing a verdict of justifiable homicide and
Nathan Fisher bringing in a verdict of
jnanslaughter. Coroner Hil! approved the
majority verdict.
Miss Cavanaugh repeated the story that
she had told to the police of the threats
made by her brother Walter ever since
two months ago that he would kill \\ il
son. Her brother was a sporting man,
she said, and "played the races." She
used to assist him with money up to two
months ago. but she refused to do so any
longer. She never gave J. P. Wilson
money, she said. On Monday night her
brother came to her house at 5 Latham
place and fired two revolver bullei.?
through the ceiling, at the same time call
ing upon Wilson to come downstairs and
be killed.
She communicated to Wilson the threats
made by her brother, and Wilson replied
that he hoped nothing would happen., as
he did not wish to have any trouble with
Cavanaugh. In reply to a question by the
Coroner she said that her brother had
served a term of imprisonment in San
Quentin Penitentiary for grand larceny.
He was very quarrelsome when drinking,
but Wilson was a very peaceable m in.
Cavanaugh always carried a revolver and
Wilson never. The revolver with which
the killing was done was formerly the
property of Cavanaugh, and she had
taken it away from her brother about a
year ago and kept it under her pillow for
protection. She presumed that Wilson
took it with him on the night of the kill-
Ing.
Frank Connolly, an eye-witness, told
how Wilson had attempted to get away
from Cavanaugh, how the latter had pur
sued Wilson into the saloon and had
twirled his revolver around In his hand
and fired a shot Into the celling. Then
Wilson fired three times into Cavanaugh's
body.
WILL MAKE A TOUR
OF SOUTHERN SEAS
R. BARRETT FITHIAN TO EMU
LATE COUNT FESTETICS.
The Santa Barbara Capitalist Has
Purchased a Vessel in Which He
Will Take a Pleasure Trip.
. R. Barrett Fithian, thp Santa Bartara
capitalist, who is now staying at tli â¢ l'r.l
-ace, is iraklng preparations for the same
sort of a pleasure trip that was under
taken some years ago by Count and
Countess Festeties. He is going on an ex
tended tour of the South Sea Islands and
expects to be gone from the latter part
of this month to next February. Ht- is
not going in the ordinary way. He is go
ing in his own yacht and he is to be ac
companied by his wife and a numb, r of
guests. The invitations are already out
and, as >et. he has received no very- de
cided refusals.
Mr. Fithian has purchased from Com
modore Gutte the old sailing schooner
Barannff, which he has renamed the Ro
ver. She will be entirely refitted and ren
ovated and converted into a first-elas3
yacht. Luxurious cabins, deck houses,
saloons, baths and all the appliances gen
erally on a pleasure craft will be
put in and when she is completed Mr.
Fithian thinks that for safety, comfort
and speed she will compare favorably
with -any craft of her size that has ever
sailed out of the Golden Gate.
The original tonnage of the BaranofC
was 64.7S The new yacht Rover will be
slightly, larger and will go on the regis
ter as a vessel of 98 tons.
As the trip is to be purely one of pleas
ure nothing that may conduce to make
life bearable in a tropical climate will be
left out of the yacht's furnishings. There
will be electric fans to cool the fevered
brow that seeks the seclusion of the
cabin and other fans for those who pre
fer to remaif on deck. There will be an
ice machine for the purpose of reducing
the temperature of the large cold bottle
and the galley will be fitted with every
modern appliance that may tend tov.ar.l
preserving the succulence of the small
hot bird. In fact, the vessel will be a
model or" comfort and convenience even if
Mr. Fithian. to cater to the social pre
judices, finds it necessary to put patent
leather tips on the Rover's fore foot.
The trip will carry the Rov.r to Hono
lulu and from there to the Marquesas.
Society and Fiji Islands, thence back
home by way of Sou*h America.

INJURING THE CITY.
THE issue between the Board of Health and
Mayor Phelan in regard to the paring of ap
propriations to bring the tax levy within the
dollar limit, having served as a pretext for closing the
Receiving Hospitals, is made use of by the Examiner
to the injury of the city's fame and ere/it. That
paper, to advertise itself, is parading a receiving hos
pital provided by it, and is making it appear to the
world that San Francisco has not a government that
can furnish it with the equipment required in the ad
ministration of all cities. It goes without saying that
the Examiner puts untruthfully the cause of closing
the public receiving hospitals. Mayor Phelan : and
ether politicians, who commend themselves to popu
lar favor and get office by agonizing about economy,
.insist that the expense of every branch of the city
-nment shall be brought down to the dollar, levy.
They usually begin to ingratiate themselves with the
taxpayers long before they succeed in assuming pub
lic responsibility and gather knowledge by actual ex
perience in administration. If they would plainly
prove the capacity of the dollar limit to sustain all
ihe public institutions necessary to the welfare of the
city, they would render a genuine service; or if, fail
ing to prove this, they would frankly admit their fail
ure, the busy people who earn and pay the taxes
would be put in possession of information useful as a
guide to their political action. Instead of doing this,
the politicians on both sides get by the ears and such_
fantastic capers result as the arbitrary closing of the
receiving hospitals, and while Mayor Phelan delib
erates without limit on the dollar limit, his yellow
organ advertises itself at the expense of the good
name of the city. The Examiner is fond of bringing
itself into notice as a substitute for government. Only
lately it announced that it had taken the place of the
Federal Government in supplying necessary articles
of uniform to the Oregon Volunteers. Its use of the
army overcoat and of the Oregon boys as sandwich
men" to pack its advertisement up and down the guard
line and through the streets of the city met prompt
exposure which laid the impudent paper naked -to
public ridicule, since only eight overcoats were ever
called for and it proved they were taken more from
curiosity than necessity.
The proper duty of a newspaper, its legitimate- func
tion, is to call attention to official neglect and failure
of administration, and inform public opinion truth
fully of the facts, tothe end that that, final judge of
all government shall force public officers to do their
duty", tell the truth and treat- the people fairly. This
is the light in which The Call regards such matters
and this paper will not encourage public officers in
demagogy or any form of infidelity to their trust,
merely that it 1 may pretend to substitute itself for
government.
The Examiner's greed for notoriety and advertising
itself at the expense of the interests of San Fran
cisco and of the State is doing harm to both.
The Mayor and Supervisors and Board of Health
could be brought to their official senses very quickly
by a frowning public opinion. We notified the Board
of Health some weeks ago that the programme to
which it was asked to submit would lead it into disas
ter. The politicians who urged that programme upon
it are responsible for their share of the party discom
fiture and- public damage that have foMowed. As
they see now the use .made of it by the enemy of the
party they profess to serve, itis-to be hoped they will
retrace their steps and ceasing to do evil will learn
io <xo well. ; .
The new crops of bugs are calculated to give pain
to the preachers who put in much of their time in de
nouncing frivolities. First came the kissing bug, and
now Redding is to the fore .with a beetle that lays
dancing eggs. Next thing we know there'll be in
sects that play cards and tope.
A St. Paul man, weary of the troubles of life, took
occasion the other daj' to commit suicide at Seattle.
He was considerate enough of the troubles of others
to choose a graveyard as the jumping-off place.

0N IMPROVED SITUATION.
THE Republican situation in this city has greatly
improved in the last few days. The bosses
have been warned by the firm independence of
: the fair-minded element which can control the party
if it will, and are making a virtue of necessity by re
treating from a field on which the prospect of their
winning is rapidly dissolving in the interest shown
by citizens who will not be bossed.
The Republican party has been too long the hope
of good government in times of stress and emer
gency to be now turned over to men who would use
the livery of Heaven for the same purpose that a
stage robber wears a flour sack.
The future of this city, for years to come, is to be
influenced by its first officiary under the new charter.
Surely no Republican worthy of the great traditions
of his party can contemplate, without wincing, the
result if either of the barnacled bosses who run the
local Democracy shall win control. Nor can such a
Republican fail to blush in the dark, if he find himself
admitting that his party, which has here a majority
containing most of the clean citizenship and civic
pride of the city, is incapable of so ordering its own
affairs as to deserve the trust of government, and,
deserving, win it at the polls.
The efforts'that have been made in the last week to
I get our most reliable Republican citizens to stand
as delegates to the municipal convention have suc
j ceeded to such an extent as to demonstrate the power
| of the party to build on its health and not on its dis
eases, on its strength and not on its weakness, and
to attract to its support the large and clean-minded
independent vote, which cares much for good govern
ment and nothing for party, in municipal affairs. We
cannot believe that there is forthcoming any such
shameful confession of lack of interest and indiffer
ence to principle as would be in a failure of the party
to rise to the full height of its opportunity.
Independent citizens look to organized forces for
action which they weigh and measure and approve or
disapprove as it squares with their ideas of right, or
1 fails. The Republican party is such an organized
force. It is not asked to surrender nor compromise
any principles, but to present a municipal ticket which
in the character and standing of the candidates is a
pledge of clean government. This is what we mean
by action that gratifies the independent voter. With
out such a ticket not only are such voters repelled,
but a large contingent of good Republicans will be
found in revolt and not to be controlled by mere
party cries. These men will say that if the city is to
have bad government its curse shall not fall upon the
people in the name of the Republican party, and by
snubbing the polls they will at once punish the dirty
self-seekers who use the party for personal ends, and
! will furnish to the people an object lesson in the shape
of government administered either from a stable Or a
bar.
High-minded Democrats find themselves between
the devil and the deep sea. Turn which way they
will, they face a boss. Their situation is not sur
mised, it does not exist in suspicion nor insinuation.
It is not a theory. It is a condition. Whatever ticket
that party may elect must come from one or the other
of its fountains of power, and the waters of both are
unspeakably foul.
Under these circumstances Democrats, and there
are legions of them, who are stockholders in our
municipal corporation, will turn gladly to a highly
ciean Republican ticket and vote it for the sake of
as much of their own party principles as stands for
good government. It is plain that a ticket which
commands the best Republican strength and senti
ment, the best element of the Democratic party an.l
the independent vote, cannot be beaten. Republican
leaders should be rejoiced nt so plain a way to suc
cess and should compel their convention to uprightly
walk therein.
Frank Cove)', a well-known Californian, announces
the discovery of a simple method for the preserva
tion of frui-t in transit. He proposes to create a
vacuum in cars by the use of an air pump. Even the
necessity for the pump will have passed when the
Santa Fe gets into full transcontinental competition j
with the Southern Pacific. Huntington will then have
cars filled with nothing but vacuum.
In giving herself in marriage the other day to Fer

NEW MINING DISTRICTS.
THE enormous increase of capital, with the enter
prise, the speculation and the general business
developments that have indelibly stamped the
last half of the ninteenth century, is mainly due to the
simultaneous discovery of gold in California and in !
Australia, followed by minor but important disclos
ures of the existence of the precious metal in parts
of the world in which it had been previously un
known.. For the last few years, after a temporary
stagnation and as if providentially to meet the argu
ments in favor of a debased currency, the output of
gold in every quarter of the globe has swelled to j
almost unprecedented proportions. Colorado . and
South Africa are separated examples of this marvelous
increase in production.
The interests ol the Pacific Coast and of California
in particular, are intimately connected with gold mm- j
ing and every new and genuine discovery is impor
tant. It is, however, a fact proved by experience in
this State and elsewhere on this coast during the last
fifty years, that each new mining district produces
intolerable hardships, aggravated by frauds. The Fra
ser River excitement of 1859 will quickly recur to old
Californians as a striking illustration, often repeated,
of the truth of this proposition.
There is a gambling element in our population, rep
resentative of speculative heartlessness and skilled in
all the seductive arts that old prospectors, the hand
to mouth miners, never learn to resist, that exagger
ates the merits of every new place where gold is found
and the more distant it is the greater the exaggera- i
tion. In nine cases out of ten, the collapse of these
fraudulent enterprises is rapid, and while ruinous
enough to those who yield to false solicitations, the !
harvest reaped by speculators and by their tools is
comparatively small. But there are some instances in
which the publications, advertisements and informa- |
tion privately disseminated in respect to new gold
mining districts have a solid though circumscribed
foundation. In the case of Dawson City and the sur
rounding country this turned out to be the fact. In |
the Cape Nome gold fields, on American territory, i
while the reports are conflicting, some gold has ob- !
viously been found.
It is exactly in such instances as these that the bene- '
j fit to the world is partly counterbalanced by injury to !
j individuals. The large amount of gold taken out of ;
the Dawson mines has been gathered by the few and
not by the many. Thousands of people, experienced
and inexperienced, but without adequate capital or re
sources, who rushed to this distant part of the frozen (
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, AUGUST 4. 1891).
north, have subjected themselves to the severest tests
I of endurance and many of them have sacrificed their
lives or have been broken down both in health and in
pocket. Meanwhile the men who thrive on the weak
nesses, the follies and the unbounded credulity of their
! fellows, before whom the mirage of wealth is perpet
! ually glittering, have feathered their own nests and
i added a new chapter to the repetitions of history.
In an inferior degree the Dawson record will doubt
i less be reproduced in the vicinity of Cape Nome.
I There is, however, one species of fraud from which
miners in the Canadian Dominion are exempt, but of
which on Alaskan soil they have been and will be the
victims. The story of our public land system until
i within a few years was a disgrace to the Government.
! By the use of dummies rich men accumulated these
lands until the substantial design of Congress to dis
| tribute them among the people, to treat them as a
; trust to be administered for the national benefit, in a
great degree was frustrated. In San Francisco no
taries public derived large profits from the wholesale
system of false affidavits/through which land specula
tors absorbed the public domain. In the timber lands
of Humboldt and Del Norte counties, in the grazing
lands of the counties of Mendocino and Trinity,
through this fraudulent perversion of the Congres
sional purpose, hundreds of thousands af acres were
concentrated in a few individuals. Nor are these more
than conspicuous examples of facts that transpired in
I other portions of the State and of the Union.
In new mining districts similar methods have been
steadily employed. Honest and industrious men, rap
idly moving to fresh opportunities for enterprise,
would find the entire country filled with locations
made through dummies for the benefit of speculators
snd would be forced either to retire or to purchase
. interests, to which they had a vested right as Ameri
can citizens, or even independently ot citizenship.
The information from the Cape Nome region is that,
under powers of attorney, practically the entire avail
| able land, supposed to contain gold deposits, has
been already appropriated. Alaska is not even terri
torially organized and this mischievous and corrupt
misuse of the law should be .promptly controlled by
the Federal Government. The law itself should receive
! Congressional attention, and be so definitely and
] clearly amended as to insure fair treatment to all seek
i crs for gold.
In every direction, under our Federal and State
government, the necessity for the rigid enforcement
of equality befoie the law is daily illustrated.
William Waldorf Astor has renounced his Ameri
can citizenship because he believed that he was being

A WORK OF PATRIOTISM.
WHILE the reception of the California Volun
teers is to be accompanied by every form of
popular rejoicing, the occasion must not be
regarded as a mere holiday festival for merrymaking
only, like a carnival or a flower fete. It will have its
serious as well as its joyous aspects, for it is designed
to be a true welcome home to the men who left their
profitable occupations and the comforts of Californian
life to go forth to war at the call of their country. ,
In arranging for such a reception as is desired by all
loyal hearts, the patriotism rather than the pleasure
loving instincts of the people is appealed to. The
sacrifices made by the volunteers were not slight.
The issue presented to them at the outbreak of the
war was one which put their manhood and their loy
alty to the supreme test. Their valor reflects honor
upon their city, their State and their fellow country
men. It is nothing more than their due that when
they return home they be met with a reception that
will be not only an outburst of popular pride and joy,
but also a manifestation of a cordial willingness to
help them in resuming their business occupations and
in finding profitable employment.
Money is needed for such a reception, and no nig
gard sum will suffice. The committee in charge of
the work estimates $50,000 will be required. It should
not be difficult to raise that sum in a city of the wealth
and population of San Francisco. If every man in the
city who cheered the boys, on in volunteering for serv
ice in the war will now contribute a dollar to the fund
the amount asked for will be exceeded by many thou
sands. Surely, then, it is not too much to ask the sum
estimated. It ought to be forthcoming within a week.
Upon the; sub-committees appointed to undertake
the details of the various parts of the work there has
been conferred'an honorable responsibility. Each and
every member of those committees should give earnest
and prompt attention to the duties imposed. By dili
gence, ardor and energy on their part, they will soon
awaken a responsive enthusiasm among the people.
It will then be comparatively easy to raise the fund
required and to carry out every feature of the recep
tion with such success as to make it a genuine tri
umph.
There is ample time for preparations, but no time to
spare. The work must be pushed forward vigorously.
The volunteers are on their way home. The commit
tees must get to work. The people must be prompt
with their contributions. In this movement of Stat^.
pride and. national patriotism there should be ho
shortcoming anywhere.

NO MORE SMASHED BAGGAGE;
LATEST LIFTING DEVICE
THE NEW ANTI-BAGGAGE SMASHING DEVICE.
GEORGE H. WALL of Cadillac, Mich., has invented a mechanism for hand
ling baggage. It is }n reality a pneumatic elevator attached to the sido
of the baggage-car door, on which may be lifted grips, trunks or other
bundles. One of these machines was completed recently and has since
been in use on the Grand Rapids and Indiana Railway.
It consists of a cylinder of brass, four inches in diameter and five feet or
more in length, which is fitted in an upright position at the side of the door of
the baggage-car. It Is provided with a telescoping collar or shell of iron, sliding
over if upon the outside, and upon the inside is a piston attached to this shell
at the top. An iron platform is attached to a steel arm, so arranged that the arm
can bo connected firmly to the bottom of the lifting steel jacket. When a cock Is
turned air at seventy pounds pressure from the source that supplies the air
brakes Is admitted to the bottom of the cylinder.
When the full pressure is turned on there is a lifting power of 575 pounds upon
the piston, but the inventor claims for his machine only a lifting capacity of
800 pounds. He says that with this uevice, which he has patented, two men can
do the work of a large number, and do it quicker and with less wear to the bag
gage.

PRESS COMMENTS ;
Does It Pay?
From Life.
HP HERE is some discussion whether
I General Otis is the best man for the
J_ place he fills, but the gist of the situa
tion seems to be that Aguinaido's
soldiers are fighting pretty well, and
promise to keep on indefinitely; that.
: though we can thrash any given lot of
Filipinos with the troops that are now in
Luzon, we cannot induce them to stay
thrashed without a much larger force
than we now have on the ground. So,
many more troops are going out, which is i
very well; but, after all, it is a good deal j
! like detailing policemen to watch ant hills.-
It can be done, but the question is sure
to come up, Doea it pay?
Nothing is happening in the Philippines
that was not foretold a year ago by the
very few men who knew the islands. It
will t^:^ <v om 50,000 to 100,000 men to

i they are not worth anything like so much
i trouble or so much money. If diplomacy
I could accomplish something it would be
a great saving, and. possibly, it might be
well to enlist a couple of regiments of
diplomatists and send them out. Com
mercial travelers, of whom a great num
ber are said to have been lately thrown i
out of employment by the spread of j
trusts, would be available for this service.
Creelman's Lies.
Uklah Republican-Press.
James Creelman is a mysterious sort
of person. A few weeks ago he was per
forming alleged wonders as a correspond
ent at Manila, using carrier pigeons and
anticipating the news of the current day
for the American breakfast table. Now I
Mr. Creelman is out in a statement that
''General Otis' conditions for press dis
patches were so outrageously unfair that
I and other correspondents, too, refused to
send anything, preferring not to send a
lot of lies." The papers that printed so
called Creelman dispatches seem to have
rilled the vacuum with devices of theic
own, signing his name to them though he
was sending nothing, as he states himself.
Mr. Creelman thinks Otis should have at- j
tacked Aguinaldo instead of trying tc |
avoid hostilities; that Otis is incompetent
and a military blunderer, and as a censor
of newspaper sensation simply unendur
able. In a word, the United States has
missed a great opportunity by not putting
Creelman in command instead of Otis.

Work was progressing rapidly in the
Franklin tunnel until a few weeks a*fo,
when the engineers discovered an ex
ceptional streak of adobe which con
tained great quantities of water. The
supporting timbers, fourteen inches
square, seemed to have no power of re
sistance to this swelling clay and tlicy
twisted out of joint. It will be necessary
to replace them and perhaps build up a
protection of bricks. This adobe runs
along in patches for some considerable
length.
The Valley road owns sixty acres of
land on %he water front of Martinez-
Fearing that great subsequent difficulty
and annoyance may result from a tim
ber support, brick has been suggested as
the necessary material to protect the tun
nel and keep it clear. Not only will this
mean a great loss of time but also a targe
and unexpected expense, as the price of
brick at present is very high. It is esti
mated that 15,000.000 bricks will be re
quired to wall the tunnel where the adobe
streaks have been found.
Owing to the enormous demand for the
brick supply and the number of con
tracts already let by brick manufactur
ers, some time will be necessary to till
the order of the Valley road should this
material be decided upon. The brick
manufacturers are busy with orders and
have refused to supply old customers, un
til present contracts are disposed of. The
conditions that exist are in a great meas
ure due to the recent increase in the con
struction of brick buildings. There are
but four or five large manufactories on
the coast and they are overwhelmed with
business. The price of bricks a year aso
was $5 per 1000. but this has steadily ad
! vanced until the present market price of
$10 per 1000 has been reached.
Tt is thought that if the Valley road
gives an order for the 15.000,000 bricks
necessary for the improvement of the
Franklin tunnel the price will jump to
per 1000. Bricks can be manufactured only
at certain seasons of the year, and con
tracts must be let far in advance of the
time when they are to be delivered. This
costs time and money. The only remedy,
and it is but a partial one. is to build the
road from- Martinez to Ray Point and
communicate with this city fmm that
place. The Southern Pacific and Santa
Fe will be close neighbors until the
Franklin tunnel is completed.

WIRES GO UNDERGROUND.
The. Street Â«'ommfttee of the Board of
: Supervisors yesterday decided to recom
mend for adoption the original under
ground wire ordinance framed by the Mer
chants' Association, despite the allega
tions that have been made that the pro
posed law had a clause In It which would
permit the San Francisco Messenger
Company and American District Tele
grnph Company to run their wires over
head. ' â¢
President Dohrmann of. the association
was present at the meeting and explained
that in drafting the ordinance the mer
chants had desired to remove all unsightly
poles but to do so by a method that
would work the least expense to the com
panies that maintain them. The proposed
ordinance, he said, was merely the first
step in the right direction, and other com
panies would be included when the move
ment was well under way.
The* ordinance will come up on Its final
passage on Monday.

The Alaska Exploration Company's
chartered steamer Charles Nelson arrived
yesterday afternoon from St. Michael via i
Dutch Harbor. She brought forty-seven
soldiers of the Third Artillery, who spent
a year in frontier duty on the Yukon. 64
cabin and 19 steerage passengers. Among |
the latter were eight unfortunates whom
the Government had to transport to San
Francisco, and the people on the Nelson |
say that destitute miners will have to !
be brought away from St. Michael in the \
fnll by the shipload or they will starve. ;
Nothing is known positively about Cape
Nome. The quality of the diggings is still
unknown and hundreds of the people who j
have flocked there, it is said, will never
make a cent.
Among the Charles Nelson's 103 passen
gers there was not $150,000 in gold dust. }
Almost everybody aboard had a little,
but In some instances the little they had
cost more than twice Its value to secure.
J. W. Wilson was the wealthiest man
aboard. He has spent fourteen years on
the Yukon and brings out about $73,000.
It was only within the last year that his
luck changed, and when he had cleaned
up enough to live on he at once got out
of the Klondike. A. J. Hartman and W.
L. Devonshire had about $25,000 between
them in dust, and .otners had drafts and
small quantities of gold to show for their
labors. All of the eight people assisted
borne by the Government have tales of
hard luck to tell. They prospected in
every camp, but struck nothing, and when |
their money gave out they had to make
the best of their way back to San Fran
cisco. , ... ,
The Charles Nelson stopped thirty-six
hours at Dutch Harbor. A fleet of eight
een sealing schooners was there and
seven more were expeotfd. They were
all waiting to go into Bering Sea on
August 1. when the place was open for .
Beating The revenue cutter Orarit was
also there coating. She hud been on a
cruise around the Prihiloff Island? and
was going back into the sea with the |
sealers. â  , ,â ,
'I he revenue cutters Rush and \\ univak
were at St. Michael when the Charles
Nelson sailed If the Wunivak can he ,
got up the river she will winter at Daw
son but there seems to be some ques
tion about her draft, so nothing had been
done with the steamer at the time of the
sailing of the Nelson. i
The Charles Nelson brought down 3443
pounds of whalebone from one of the
whalers that met her at Unalaska. Rev.
i Raphael Kedroosky, the Russian mls
: siotaary at th;y place, and his wife came
down on the steamer.
The crfw of the transport Senator was
paid off yesterday. There is some doubt
as to the sending back of the steamer.
The Government la very anxious to get
many men to the Philippines as quickly
as possible before the spring campaign
opens *o the chances are that the Sen
ator will go back. Chief Steward George
Hume was on the sick list all the latter
part of the voyage and will start for the
springs to-day to recuperate. There will
be a number of changes in the engineer's
department and Purser Campbell may not
go out on the vessel if she returns to
Manila.
Captain Batchelder was treated to a
surprise at the Government wharf yes
terday morning. A few days ago he
shaved off his mustache and his many
friends said it improved his good looks
considerably. Imagine nig astonishment,
however, when nearly every employe on
the wharf put in an appearance yester
day with a clean upper lip. Harry Scott,
superintendent of the dock, was the first
to arrive, and Batchelder had to look at
him twice before he recognized him. A
few minutes later along came Port
Steward Bussell and right behind him
was Captain Dunn, the chief stevedore.
When Captain Batchelder saw that they
also were clean shaven he began to
wonder, but when Clerks Harry Parker,
X R Patterson and Joe Matthews came
along minus any hair on the upper lip,
he was diÂ»r.ust">d and hnanlod th* hos
pital ship Relief. All the gatekeepers de
cided to shave off their mustaches last
night so there should be a ciean-shaven
force on the Government wharf to-day.
F TV' Marauart. a Berkeley bicyclist, is
laid up in the Harbor Hospital for re
pairs. He started up Clay street from the
j ferries, and seeing a wagon taking up the
center of the road he went to the right.
The driver of the wagon wanted to make
a stop on the north side of the street, so
! when Marquart went to his right the
: driver turned his horse to the left and the
! collision followed. The bicyclist was
i stunned by the fall and was so badly
' bruised that he had to be removed to the
hospital in the ambulance.
The Pacific Mail Company's steamer
: Barracouta arrived from Acapulco vester
' day in ballast. She has been on the run
i between Panama and Central American
ports and has come home for an over
hauling.
There was trouble on the British ship
i Talus yesterday and when the vessel put
ito sea six of the crew were in irons. Ser
geant Bunner and Officer McGowtn of the
harbor police wont as far as Fort Point
en the ship and then Captain Stenhouse
said he could handle the gang himself.
: There is a great scarcity of men on the
front and Captain Stenhouse had some
trouble in getting a crew. Six A. B.s cost
i him $120 In "blood money." and when
these men refused at the last moment to
! go out in the ship it madr- the captain
: angry. The men then refused duty, so
the police were summoned and the mu
tineers were placed in irons. The captain
was then in a quandary about getting hi*
! ship to sea, but finally secured some men
1 from the shore to go as far as the light
ship with him. They made sail on the
ship and then boarded the tug and came
back to the city. Captain Stenhouse told
Sergeant Bunnpr that as soon as he got i
; clear of the harbor he would release the '
I mutineers and put them to work, so the ;
j six men are now probably standing an
extra watch for the trouble they made.
THE KENNEDY MURDER.
i Prosecution Bests Its Case and the
Defense Will Be Submitted
Monday.
The preliminary examination of Come- j
lius Manning, charged with the murder \
of Mrs. Mary Kennedy by throwing a
lighted lamp at her on the night of July i
| 4 in his mother's house, 2141 Jones street, I
was continued before Judge Conlan yes- j
i terday. Dr. H. E. Morrison of the Harbor i
; Hospital testified to the nature of Mrs.
Kennedy's wounds.
Thomas Kennedy, a boy 8 years of ape,
and nephew of the dead woman, contra-
I dieted his uncle in two important par- i
! tioulars. He testified that the fight took ;
: place in the dining room, and that one
! lamp was in the dining room and the other :
in the kitchen. His uncle when examined |
I testified that the fight took place in the \
; kitchen and that both lamps were in the j
dining room. The boy saw Manning after i
the fight on the lounge in the dining room
grab hold of the lamp and turn it upside ;
down and the glass fell off. He and hi*
brother then ran out. as they were scared
of being burnt-d. When Manning grabbed
hold of the lamp he said, "Now I have got
you." He did not see any lamp thrown. j
John Tarleton. 14 Lick street, testified :
that he called at the Manning house that '
night and they were all drinking steam
beer. He left before any trouble began.
' ' Sergeant Anderson and Policeman At-
I tridge testified as to arresting Manning
' and the prosecution rested.
Attorney J. X. K. Wilson for the defense I
I submitted a door as evidence, and Mary I
Manning, sister of the defendant, identi
fifl it as the door of a closet In the din- j
ing room. Wilson said that the door would !
play an important part in the defense.

EASTERN MARKETS
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW. YORK. Auk. 3.â To-day's stock mar
ket was professional almost entirely and was '
dull, except in one or two spots. Symptoms
of strength were confined to a few of the spe- \
cialties, notably Tobacco, which made up a I
large proportion of the day's total transactions.
The movement in th!s stock was attributed to
mariTpulaUon directed against the shorts,
whose efforts to cover helped the advance. ;
Sympathetic strength was shown by Contlnen- i
tal Tobacco. Tennessee Coal continued its
remarkable ."how of strength and closed at the
highest price at a net gain of 2V4 points.
Otherwise the iron and steel stocks were mr
r lined to depression. Wall street had rumors
that t!i(>re had been a slump to-day in pig
lion prices abroad, but this could not be
verified. There have been recent purchases of
steel abroad,- but these were simply the re
sult of the great scarcity and great demand
In this country. Dispatches reporting a
'I-roatened plague of grasshoppers in Western
States were used with effect to depress ' the
Kranger stocks. The trunk lines aleo were
heavy.
The recent buying: by London in this market
fame to a stop, owing to the decision of the
1-oixlon h;iiiÃe to close from Friday until
Tuesday over the bank holiday, on Monday.
The bears made a successful attack on
Brooklyn Transit, People's Gas and Rock Ul
cnil c-arly in the day. thus Increasing the ten
dency to reaction. The market had its periods
i r" strength sustained by the movement in To
bacco, firmness in Sugar, strength In Rubber
find â  n.-ral Electic and a few of the railroad
stocks. The strength wai not 'maintained and
the Isolated railroad stocks, such as Bt. Louis
Southwestern and some of the Southern
stocks which showed small net gains, were so
nearly inactive as to have little effect on the j
general market The undertone of the market
was heavy until the close, notwithstanding
a sudden marking of Brooklyn Transit. The
retention by the Bank of England of its exist
ing rate of discount instead of an advance, .
failed to have a very reassuring effect. j
The private rate or discount in London ad- ,
vanced a fraction above the bank rate, Sterl
ing Exchange in New York resumed its down
ward course, notwithstanding the advance in i
the London private rate and the announce- ,
ment of a shipment from Australia to Sun ,
Francisco of $1,206,675 in gold. In Pans rentes
tended downward again. These Incidents are
accepted -ns admonitions that if exchange here
falls to the gold Import point. London ana j
the Continent will sell securities rather than ,
part with the gold. The decline in the local |
money market was after most of the daj s
business was over and was without signifi- |
cance. Kansas City. Plttsburg and Gulfs con- .
tinued in demand to-day and gained % pÂ«r cent
; net. Otherwise the bond market was dull and ,
rather Irregular. Total Bales par value, $1,100,- ,
' United States bonds were unchanged on bid
quotations.

THE LONDON MARKET.
NEW YORK. Aug. 3.â The Commercial Ad
vertiser's Londcn financial cablegram says".
The markets were extremely irile to-day, in
view of holidays and the hard money. The
bank rate was not changed, but a rise Is
thought Inevitable, the reserve being lower in
iplte of the heavy Influx of gold from abroad.
The bank did considerable business in consols.
.Americans were dul! and featureless and the
finish was fractionally lower. The bank bought
Â£162.000 in gold bars and Â£GO6O in German coin.
Ten thousand pounds were engaged for Buenos
Ayres.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET. _â 
CHICAGO, Aug. 3.-Ix>ngs in wheat struck at j
the beginning of trading in the shape of lower
quotations from Liveri>ool. Ab the local mar- ,
ket showed a substantial rally yesterday at ,
least no weakness was looked for in foreign
markets and the Liverpool decline slight
\ though It was. resulted In an Jobs here I
of about %c. September started â *"Â£Â£Â«*Â£ j
The absence of toreign demand for American
wheat was again noticeable, but after -the first
selling movement had ceased this was
sight of in the continued reports ; of domestic
crop damage, which were so serious as to
cause the market to rally to yesterday's clos
ing Drice The damage was reported as being ,
particularly heavy In the Red *^Â« r * Â£'!*
and estimates place the total area affec ted aa
high as 150,000 acres, with probably N-*OO.OOO |
worth of growing grain destroyed. Utercabk
showed some rally in foreign markets and this
also encouraged buying. September rose to ,
70c, but reacted to 69%@68%c. on large Prlmarj
receipts. The liberal clearances sent the price
up to about 68% c. There were many minor
rallies and reactions, but during the afternoon
the market gradually tended downward. The
seaboard reported little foreign demand, ana
this coupled with the continued large primary
receipts apparently had a good deal of in
! nuence on longs, for considerable wheat was
p Ut on the market. The market was qu.to ;
i weak toward the close, September declining to .
6S'.,fi6Â«c and closing at 6Â§%c. Near the close ;
i Minneappolis wired that new spring wheat was
offered to arrive there In two weeks !
Corn 1 in the main was acme and
flnrn Reports of damage by hot weather In ;
â Kansas firm cables and light rece caused ,
a rally early, BhorU covering freely fl l e P , te n or

Influenced almost entirely by other grains and
the ranse of prices was narrow. l han|!r.g

tember closed a shade higher.
The improved yellow fever situation caused a ,
better feeling in provisions and the market was \
; strong and fairly active throughout. Opening

Lower cables from Liverpool were a damper
on the Chicago market. There were more
buyers than sellers, but trade was dull. Later
on the feeling was firmer, crop news being
more bullish. The Herald reported 150,000
acres In the Red River Valley destroyed by
hail, and the Kansas Corn crop was reported
damaged by hot winds. Lighter receipts and
large clearances were expected to decrease the
visible supply next Monday. The bull senti

Call's Suggestion.
A FORT FOR LAKE MERCED
CONDEMNATION SUIT TO BE BE
GUN AT ONCE.
Heavy Guns Will Command the Only
Vulnerable Point of the City
and We Will Be Fully
Protected.
The Government has acted upon a i
suggestion made in The Call on Sun- ;
day. May 1, IS9Bâ the day that Admiral
Dewey annihilated the Spansh fleet in
Manila Bay. It has condemned prop
erty on the ocean beach which The Call
stated was the one weak point in the
city's defense, and will shortly strongly
fortify and garrison it, thus protecting :
Fan Francisco from any hostile ships
of war that may gather and threaten it. '
In the article printed in The Call on
the date mentioned occurred the follow- |
ing:
"A couple of fast cruisers heavily
armed would bring up one morning just
outside the Golden Gate, opposite the i
ocean beach. A formal demand would j
FORT FOR LAKE MERCED.
be made upon the Mayor of the city i
for indemnity â penalty for non-com- |
pliance, bombardment and destruction
of the town.
"What of our splendid fortifications,
cur heavy guns dispersed about the en- j
trance to the Golden Gate? What about
the submarine mine fields about which ;
we have h^ari so much? They are ail
thore and ready to protect the harbor !
against any hostile v< BseL San Fran
cisco Bay is practically Impregnable.
But, unfortunately, though the harbor
well protected, the city is abso
lutely defenseless. Between Point IjG
bos and Lake Merced there is a space
of ocean commanded by no heavy gun. j
There is nothing to prevent an enemy
anchoring there and bombarding the
city at its leisure; the rani?e of modern
weapons is equal to the task."
Attention was then directed in the
article to how easily such a danger as j
mentioned could be avoided, in these |
terms:
"A few heavy gun batteries, planted
among the sandhills between Point Lo
bos and Lake Merced, would completely '
t the city. Their cost would be
but thousands, while the r.ipt of a bom- i
bardment to San Francisco would run:
into millions. Tt is the one weak point j
in our system of defense, and It should j

Uniti States District Attorney Coombs
receiver] by mall yesterday a communica
tion from the Department of Justice at i
Washington Instructing him to bring suit ;
in the Vnit'-'i States Circuit Court to con
demn 45.28 acres in the L.aguna de la
Merced tract near Ingleside for the pur- '
poses of military fortifications nr.d a gar
rison. The property belongs to the Spring
Valley Water Company a.nrl was offered i
to the Government by that corporation j
for $1000 per acre, hut the price was ,
deemed excessive and a board of military
men was appointed to report upon thp
site and its value. Major C. E. G. B. j
Davis made the report some months ago i
and it was indorsed by Brigadier General
John Wilson of tr.< Division of Engineers.
Secretary leer signed the report on July
24. Major Davis placed a value of from J
$600 to 1700 per acre upon the property.
After the condemnation of the property
the overnment will lose no time in for- â 
tifylng the place and building the neces
sary nouses for the garrison. The north |
boundary of the tract Is a little more than |
half a mile south of the old Ocean Sido j
House. It is a bluff jutting out into th" i
Pacific Ocean and 100 feet above the level I
of the water, commanding a fine view of !
the entrance to the harbor. The fortiflca- i
tions will prevent any hostile war vessels j
from approaching the land near enough
to throw sheila Into any part of the city.
Mortar batteries and 15-lnch rllles will |
constitute the armament, and when the
fort shall have been finished San Fran
cisco will be as Impregnable as Gibraltar. |
HOPE FOR MRS. BOTKIN.
The Decision in the Hoff Case Leaves
the Way Open to Her.
The police are considerably exercised
over the decision of the Supreme Court
Jr. granting a new trial to Albert Hoff,
the murderer of Mrs. Mary Clute. and
Captain Seymour said yesterday that the
decision entirely reversed the same court
in the Durrant case.
In the Hoff ca.se Judge Cook, in charg
ing the jury on the motive point,, used
exactly the same language as Judge Mur
phy in his charge to the jury In the Dur
rar.t case, a comparison of the records
bearing him out in that statement. For
the past ten year 3 Judge Murphy had
used the identical words In every charge
made by him to a jury when the question
of motive was involved, and the Hoff
case decision was a surprise to him as
well as to the police.
It Is now considered probable that un
less a rehearing is demanded and the de
cision of the Supreme Court reversed
Mrs. Botkin will apply for a nev.' trial,
basing her application on the decision in
the Hoff case.
LABOR'S PROTEST.

by the executive COtntHlttM of the San

THE MERCHANTS,
THE MAYOR AND
THE TAX LEVY
Politics and Figures
Submitted.
BOTH INSIDE THE DOLLAR
SCHOOLS SUFFER FOR THE FIRE
DEPARTMENT.
Supervisors Called Upon to Adjust
Fignres and Reorganize Some
Badly Jumbled Political
Ideas.
The Finance Committee of the Board \
: of Supervisors held last night what was â 
1 perhaps the most important meeting In
its existence. In an effort to honor a
pledge that the tax levy for this fiscal
year should be one dollar on every
$100 on an assessed valuation of $330,
--000,000 the committee had made a com
: plete series of estimated appropria
; tions for every municipal office. The
1 announcement of these estimates was
met by an outcry of protest from a ma
| jority of city and county officers. Fi
-1 nanclal disaster, deficiencies and muni
'â  cipa.l discredit wore predicted. Ap
: peals were made on all Bides for a re
j vision of the appropriations, and in
I justice to the departments concerned
; the Finance Committee determined to
take counsel with the Mayor and the
Merchants' Association.
Mayor Phelan, who is pledged to a
dollar limit of taxation on the indi
cated total assessed valuation, promised
to submit a series of appropriations for
municipal offices which would honor
the pledge. The Merchants' Associa
tion agreed to do the same, and last
night the Finance Committee met to
consider the various suggestions. For
nearly four hours the estimates of the
Finance Committee, the Mayor, the
Merchants' Association and the Audit
or were discussed.
Dr. Perrault, chairman of the Finance
Committee, presided and acted as in
terrogator. The figures of the Auditor
were left practically out of considera
tion, as they were made upon a basis
of a tax levy of $1 15. The other figures
which were submitted were on a basis
of a dollar limit, excluding the proposed
appropriation for St. Mary's Park and
several small deficiencies. The appro
priations for the different departments,
as suggested, were considered in de
tail.
At the outset it was seen that the
estimates of the Mayor and of the Mi r
chants' Association were singularly
similar and in significant details dlffer
! ent from those of the Finance Commit-
I tee of the Board of Supervisors. It
i was quite plain that Mayor Phelan had
been advised of what the Merchants'
Association intended to do and had
acted accordingly, reserving the privi
lege of changing the estimates of the
; Merchants' Association to .^uit political
conditions. Where the Merchants' As
sociation hn<l made reductions in de
partments which possess political In
fluence the Mayor, politically wise, was
generous. He Judiciously increased the
appropriations for departments that
represent votes, as the Department of
Public Schools for example.
As the discussion of the different esti
mates progressed another significant
fact was discovered. The Mayor and
the Merchants' Association, determined
to submit a levy based absolutely on a
dollar limit, found it expedient to re
i duce the salaries of municipal em-
I ployes.
This reduction whp found nerppsary
in several departments and the Mayor,
in answer to a query of Dr. Perrault,
declared that city employes would be
well paid after they had Buffered the
i reductions which he suggested. Dr.
Perrault replied that while the Finance
j Committee welcomed the suggestions
i of thÂ« Mayor, an effort would be made
to honor the dollar limit pledge with
. OUt reducing salaries.
The third and last distinguishing
feature of the estimates submitt> 1 by
â¢ Mayor Phelan was revealed when the
appropriation for the Assessor was
discussed. It was then found that the
Mayor, for reasons which probably
suggested themselves to him as ade
quate, had discriminated in favor of
Democratic officers and against Re
publican officials. He had increased
the appropriation of the Assessor and
reduced that of the Tax Collector. He
attacked the clerical force of the Li
fPnFe Collector, Justice Clerk and
Supervisors. He pleaded statutory
limitations whon he urged reductions
and fell bark upon the necessities of
municipal government when he 'advo
cated Increased.
After all the various estimates had
been discussed Dr. Perrault declared
that the Finance Committee would en

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, AUGUST 4. 1899.
-1 deavor to equalize all the suggestions
I and would be glad to meet again with
' representatives of the Merchants' As
! BOciation.
President Dohrmann of the Mer
' chants' Association opened the meet
i Ing with the statement that the levy
I which he submitted was not considered
iby its framers a perfect instrument.
! Also he unshouldered all responsibility
I for the success or non-success of the
! dollar limit. The formulation of the
i \esy, he said, was merely an incident
I In the movement for better things the
I Merchants' Association had started.
I He emphasized the statement that the
j association would not be responsible
j for the non-success of the levy he sub
i mined if it should be adopted by the
Board of Supervisors and made the
permanent schedule.
To this rather startling opening
; statement Supervisor Perrault, chair
man of the Finance Committee, did not
reply. He merely requested Clerk
Russell to proceeed with the reading of
the merchants' schedule. Then it de
veloped that Mayor Phelan had taken
advantage of an idle afternoon to make
a little schedule of his own. He had
j been provided with a copy of the sched
ule of the merchants, and with that
! and those of the Auditor and Finance
i Committee before him he had prepared
[ a levy for submission, for which he
resigned all responsibility, which was
quite within the limit and which made
as unique a political parallel as ever
went into print.
In many things his schedule agreed
to the letter with that of the mer
chants, particularly in the pronounced
inclination that was evident to scale
the salaries attached to the unintlu
ential positions in tho gift of the city:
the janitors, the firemen, the engineers,
and electricians and the men who
guard the prisoners at the branch
county jails. His schedule also elim
inated the Park Emergency Hospital.
Over the janitors there was some
rather heated debate. Chairman Per-
rault asked Mr. Kelley of the associa
tion if it were a fact that he wished
to reduce the salaries of the janitors
and at the same time double their work
by reducing their number from 32 to
20. Mr. Kelley replied that it was, and
that if the Supervisors advertised for
men they could fill the positions at
that price. He said the same thing
with regard to the guards at Brancn
County Jail No. 2, whose salaries the
Merchants and the Mayor's levies re
duced from $55 to $50 per month with
subsistence.
The fact that the County Clerk had
been awarded a thousand and more less
, than the amount awarded him by the
temporary levy, Supervisor Perrault
j said, it would be impossible to operate
( the office at that figure. President
Dohrmann retorted that the County
Clerk had been allowed the amount al
: lowed by the charter.
Mr. Phelan's schedule reduced the
District Attorney's appropriation mate
! rially. When asked how he accom
plished it he said he had done away
with the position of chief clerk, who,
; he said, was a mere supernumerary in
that department. His schedule also
dropped three men from the License
'< Collector's department, and when asked
pointedly by Perrault if the chief clerk,
â  whose appointment he had, was among
those he contemplated dropping he was
at some trouble to explain.
His figures also did not allow for two
clerks of the seven now engaged by the
Board of Supervisors as assistants to
| Clerk Russell. Mr. Phelan said in cx
i planation he did not think the man
who wrote the minutes and the bond ex
pert were absolute necessities and he
had neglected to provide for them. He
! referred it to Clerk Russell and after
that official had made his reply Mr.
; Phelan took it back and was willing
that they be provided for.
When asked how it was that he and
! the merchants had cut down the Tax â 
j Collector, the Park, the County Clerk !
and a few other of the Republican of- |
i fices to the advantage of the Fire De
partment, Assessor Dodge and others j
of their political faith, he could not ex- i
. plain, except to say that Assessor â 
Dodge had done magnificent work and I
was entitled to a bonus. Of the fact
i that the two schedules agreed in hold
ing clown the County Clerk and other
equally essential departments to the :
strict figure of the statutes while they
allowed the Fire Department and fire
alarm and police telegraph to soar
profitably above the law, he had noth
ing to say, save that they were of ab
solute necessity to the protection of
the city and should not be crippled.
"Why should the County Clerk and
: the Tax Collector be crippled?" asked
Chairman Perrault.
The Merchants' schedule provides for
a tax of one dollar on $:i499.349; the
Mayor's a tax of one dollar on $3,754,
--723, not counting the St. Mary's Park
fund and judgments agairst the city
inside the pledge. The St. Mary's Park
appropriation, he claimed, should not
be considered Inside the pledge and
should not count in the levy. The orig
inal levy'of the Finance Committee con
templated a tax of one dollar on $3,500,
--! 000, or ninety-two cents on $3,800,000.

Elmers' Mysterious Disappearance.
The friends in Bakersfield of Anthony
Eimers have urged the police to renewed
efforts to ascertain what has become of
him, and Detective Anthony has been de
tailed on the case. Eimers lived with
Mrs. Harter at 331 Eddy street, and on
the morning of July 29 last year he left
the house, tilling- her that he would re
turn in a few hours. That was the last
seen of him. He had been drinking heav
ily and had squandered about $1400 in two
months. It was reported later that he
had committed suicide in the Santa Cruz
Mountains, but that was not confirmed.
HENRY MILLER
GIVES "HAMLET"
NEW INTEREST
About the last man who knew every
j thing was Dante. Since his time all men, '
even actors, have been obligee. In a meas
ure to specialize. Still it is a question !
whether an actor's genius can in this way ,
I be compelled to yield what it contains. â 
! Mr. Miller we have always looked upon j
j as the perfect stage lover, equally com- i
' pelllng, no matter what the century, no :
! matter how the course of love might run,
' and as it has ever been the care of the j
' critic that the interests of the true tra- i
gedian shall be safeguarded from the en- I
| croachmenta of the versatile star, Mr. j
i Miller's Hamlet has from the first been |
| marked for disapproval. More than a few i
!of us have said aloud: "1 cannot see
! Henry Miller in 'Hamlet.' It Is not possi
ble. With the memory of Booth still
fresh, too; what temerity." Reverent and ;
! gratefully as we shall ever speak the
name of Booth, we must remember that;
j there were many Hamlets before him and
' there will probably be muny to follow
i him. And even Booth's Hamlet grew so
' that what began by being impetuous,
! forceful and full of striking but artificial
methods became in later years melan
choly intellectual, philosophical, ideal. If :
we want new pictures we must have wall
space and a kindly light. Room was made
! for the frescos of Raphael by sweeping
away those of Peruglni and a few others.
! Therefore let us give Mr. Miller's Hamlet
room and light and judge it on its own
merits. Let every fluwer blossom on its
own stalk.
Mr Miller's is a very uneven bloom. j
Some scenes are excellent, some passages
So beautiful that their expression yea
o â ,w Interest to the character. Ihe
players' scene and the scene with his !
> mother are handled with so much
strength that whatever flaw* there may
be are unnoticed. The graceful, dlgnlued.
natural interpretation oÂ£ the interview
with his mother, the struggle between
anger and tenderness, are almost a com
mentary of the character as Mr. Miller
â¢es it His attitude at the exit of the
ghost convinces us that amazemont and
sorrow overwhelm a solitary man lhe
little action with the sword hilt, forming
a cross at the words "For my part i n go
pray." the sudden tenderness of tha one
when he says to Ophelia, "1 did, I did lov â 
you once," an<l again when at the Brave
but a breath articulates "The fair Ophe- i
lia," his reading of the line, "He was a
i man, take him for all in all. I shail not
look upon his like again"-these and many
other things that for lack of space can
not be mentioned make US realize that
Mr Miller's dramatic Hamlet reaches a
i i.rettv close touch to nature. The real
Hamlet, the subjective Hamlet, .ceiim
the Bollloquies falls far short of being
Ideal He hurries over the lines as though
he would be through with them and de
stroys the Idea of introspection by cuper-
Efepeclally is this haste seen in the solil
oou'v on suicide. There is no horror at the
â  realization of "what .lreams may come."
! The tongue gives utterances to words and
j the hrnin rushes on to other ideas and
I there are no rellective pauses. The atti
! tude of the audience throughout the play
i perfectly reflected the unevenness of i*ir.
Miller's ' Hamlet ânow cold and unemotion
: al, now anxious to applaud to the echo.
â  In many pronop there is too sudden a re
covery from emotions; too little depth of
feelingâ and Hamlet was feeling, not ac
tion. A difficult task, indeed, when the :
j good and bad are bo plentifully mixed to
â¢'report me and my cause aright to the
unsatisfied." We bow to its strength and
| regret its weakness.
The role of Ophelia has r.ever been con-
I sldered the ultimate goal of any actress
and has more often than not been given
to those who have been found wanting
and who quickly fell into obscurity. Mips
i Anglin is an Ophelia so charming as to be
i almost perfect. She reads the lines as the y
have never been read before and of the j
simp! >8t passages makes an opportunity.
: If one ever doubted her artistic sense
: and her great ability Ophelia last night
i dispelled the doubt. The simple beauty
of her costumes, made by a local firm.
added not a little to the charm of the
part.
We have been bo used to poor ghosts
! that Mr. Walcot may be pronounced good.
I Mr. Standing was a pleasant surprise as
: Laertes and Mr. Brown a disappointment
! as Horatio. Never have we seen a better
j Polonius than Mr. Allen. His reading of
: the letter to the King and Queen is a
! work of dramatic art to be much ap
-1 plauded. Another pleasant disappoint
ment was Mrs. Boucicault as the Queen.
Her work, especially with Hamlet, from
j whom she seemed to take the key, was
' most artistic. Another good piece of work
I was Mr. Lamb's first gravedigger. He
had the sympathy and attention of the
audience throughout the scene. Miss
Dal< spoke her few lines with good ef
fect and Mr. Stevens made an acceptable '
King. The first player was so poor that |
we all agreed with Hamlet when he said j
of his speech, "It is too long-." We. too. i
thought he would never "come to He-
I cuba."
CHARLOTTE THOMPSON.
LEFT HIS WEALTH
WITH A BARTENDER
WHOFFHEIZ, a returned Klondiker, is a victim of misplaced confi
dence to the extent of SS6S in greenbacks and a draft for $150(3 m
the Bank of Victoria, B. C. He had been mining for over a year
in Alaska and returned with his two partners on the St. Paul,
â  which arrived last Saturday.
He had never been In this city, and after he and his partners had taken
rooms at Twelfth and Howard streets they started out to take in the sights.
About midnight Hoffheiz left Ilia two friends on Market street, near Fifth,
and after walking a block or two filtered a saloon. He was talking about
the money he had in his possession, and a man standing at the bar suggested
to him that he would be doing a wise thing to hand over the money and
draft to the care of the bartender, as it might get stolen from him. Hoff
heiz had the money and draft in a buckskin sack, which was tied round his
v.-alst. and he handed it over to Che bartender. His name was printed on the
pack. ' The money consisted of five $100 greenbacks, six $T>n greenbacks, throe
120 and a $.">. He had a few dollars left, and when he staggered out of the
saloon he hired a hack and drove around till the hackman put him out be
cause his money was exhausted.
This was early Sunday morning, rtnd after wandering around for some
hours he met a policeman and told him about hte troubles. The policeman
advised him to go to police headquarters and directed him how to get there.
He succeeded and told his story to Detective George Graham, who made an
arrangement with him to be at the City Hall that evening. Hoffheiz did not
show up, and it was not till yesterday morning: that one of his partners hap
pened to'come across him. He had been wandering around the city searching
for the saloon where he had left his money. His bed had been a. chair in
gome saloon, and he had not partaken of a square meal. He had forgotten
where he and his partners had taken rooms, and did not like to go to police
headquarters again, but his friends took him there yesterday. Payment of
the check on the Bank of Victoria has been stopped, and every effort will be
made to find the saloon where he left his money. Detective Graham has
been working on the case, but without success. Hoffheiz remembers that
there were two bartenders in the saloon, but he wps so full of liquor that he
remembers nothing more. He will give a liberal reward for the return of the
money. The police are anxious to know the name of the hackman, as he
might be able to throw tome light on the subject.

MARY AND JOHN TO LIVE
APART, BUT NO DIVORCE
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway. Aug. 3.
Mary and John Gooby will forever here
! after walk through life separately and
i apart, but a decree of divorce based upon
1 any cruelty, desertion or failure to pro
vide that has marred their past thirty
i years of matrimonial vicissitudes will not
1 be granted.
What wa.Â« supposed to be the last and
; final chapter in the history, of Mary and
i John's tribulationsâ that have each had
I their day in courtsâ has been occupying
, the attention of Judge Greene the past
i three days, the case being Mary Gooby
vs. John Gooby. wherein the first named
asked for a divorce and possession of
I property located at Seventh and Linden
, streets." An important pleading in the
! suit was the husband's cross-complaint,
1 wherein he likewise prayed urgently that
his promise made at the altar many years
ago be declared null and void. For multi
plicity of grounds alleged, for Intricacies
' of rank perjury and truth and for general
legal comedy the case rivals any that has
! ever been tried In the history of the Su
perior Court.
The wife, who boasts at least fifty
pounds avoirdupois over her husband, re
i cited on the witness-stnnJ the many acts
1 of cruelty alleged, and how John had
wasted his fortune in gambling on tne
stock market. She waÂ» corroborated by
her eldest daughter, who testified that on
one occasion she had to drag her father
1 by his ancient whiskers to prevent him
from beating the life out of her corpulent
mother. Another daughter. Mrs. Maude
Boyle, testified on the other hand that the
! parents hiul always quarreled and that
! on one occasion Mrs. Gooby had threat
; ened to shoot the father. Sho said that
she had usually collected the rents from
' her father's houses, but that the mother
' got every cent for the father's board.
To all such testimony Judge Greene for
the past three days lent an attentive ear.
i and at 6 o'clock this evening his Honor
summed up accounts and decided that
neither Mary nor John shoiild take any
thing by their causes of action.
CONTESTANT IN THE
WICKES ESTATE WINS
OAKLAND, Aug. 3.â The contest be
tween Annette P. Clarke of San Fran
cisco and Dr. J. M. Shannon over the es
tate of the late Olive J. Wickes was de
cided in favor of the former by Judge
Hiil to-day. The matter came up to
day for the hearing of Dr. Shannon's
petition for the probate of an alleged
will in which he was named as executor
and under the terms of which Mrs.
Wickes' property in Fresno County and
$5000 <>n deposit in the Hibernta Bank
was bequeathed to the doctor, who alleged
that at the time of her death Mrs. Wickes
was a resident of Alameda County. Peti
tioner was represented by Attorneys Z.
N. Goldsky, R. X. Griffin and Messrs.
Dunne <t McPlke.
Contestant Annette P. Clarke appeared
by her attorneys, George D. Squires and
otto turn Suden, as executrix of the last
will of Alfred M. Wickes, heir at law
of Olive Jane Wickes, and she contended
that the latter was a resident of San
Francisco County, hut that just prior to
her death had been in Oakland under

decided in favor of contestant by refus
ing to grant Dr. Shannon's petition and
ruling that his court has no purisdictlon
to admit Mrs Wickes 1 will to probate.

MRS. KELLY FIRES
FACTS AT ENEMIES
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
908 Broadway, Aug. 8.
Mr?. Helen Kelly has been made the
victim of much whispering since it be
came known that she was to leave the
secretaryship of the Associated Charities
on September 1.
It has been stated that Mrs. Kelly was |
very discriminating in her administration: :
that certain churches and influences were j
favored by h* r more than others. At va
rious times Mrs. Kelly has been charged
with being too inquisitive, and with U
tempting to override the wishes of some i
of the district visitors. Rumor* have also j
gone around that the secretary lacks j
business ability and that it is largely due
to her Incapacity that the Associated ;
Charities is now a finaneinl wreck Â«itn
little prospects of being salved.
Those and similar insinuations have
been fieely circulated and have come to
the knowledge of Mrs. Kelly. To-day |
she made public positive denial of all such
insinuations and produced facts in justi
fication of her statement that the failure j
of the Charities is in no way due to her
mismanagement.
After a resume of the actual work of
the association since August 1. 1593, when
Mrs. Kelly took charge, she proceeds to
show that the laundry business in con
nection with the Charities was a failure
from the start, as was also the free bath
house. She says: '
The laundry was a losing business from the
Ftart. I had no control of it, only receiving
â¢he moneys Riven me from it and paying its
bills by warrant. With regard to the wood
yard I only received the moneys paid for sale*
of wood, which moneys I raid out on order
of the president.
Last fall the Charities decided that a
chain letter system would very roon
bring it out of its financial hole, but the
following paragraph from her report
shows that the thousands that were ex
pected from this source did not pour into
the coffers and the endless chain proved
to have a very definite end:
An Indebtedness of $1000 is before us. The
laundry, woodyard and baths are closed. Three
appeals have been made to the public during
the present fiscal year. The Thanksgiving
offering gave us $94 25. The chain letter hrlped
us |>Ul and the Joaquin Miller lecture gave us
859. Having the interest of the poor of the
city so much at heart as I have, would It
be likely that I would have placed the asso
ciation in such financial straits and then aye
It to have its difficulties settled by a stranger?
PROFESSOR HITTER RETURNS.
The Distinguished Scientist Satisfied
With the Results of the Har

BERKELEY, Anp. 3.â Professor W. E.
Rltter of the University of California, |
who was chosen as specialist in zoology
to accompany the Harrlman Alaskan ex
pedition, arrived at his home in Berkeley i
to-day. Professor Ritter expresses him- j
self as highly pleased with the results i
of the trip and praises the skill and care |
expended on the equipment of the expe- ;
dition and in the provisions made for its
cotnfoTt during its absence in the far j
north.
"The tour," he said to-day, "was full
of interest and delight as well as scientific
achievement. The days were cloudless ;
and warm, and there was light enough for
outdoor work at any time during the
twenty-four hours. The results of our
I investigations wore most gratifying, many ;
new species being discovered, and the ]
distribution of these and others were
observed.
"The botanists of the party were de- ;
lighted, as indeed we all were, at the
beauty, size and coloring of the wild j
Bowers on the islands along the coast. \
My own work concerned the marine in
vertebrates, and their variety and num
ber were astonishing, many of them being i
heretofore unknown to science. The re- |
suits of the expedition will be chronicled
by John Burroughs, the historian of the :
: party, and in bulletins to be issued by the
Washington Academy of Sciences. I shall
of course embody my own observations in
lectures before my classes and pert Taps I

HORRIBLE DEATH OF
AN OAKLAND BABY
OAKLAND, Aug. 3.â Little Louisa Silva,
the three-year-old child of Manuel Silva,
residing at Thirty-third street and Four
teenth avenue, met a horrible death this
evening on Hopkins street, near the Cali
fornia College. The child was in the care
of an older sister, Annie, at the time and
they, together with a dozen other chil
dren, were enjoying a ride on the four
horse hay wagon of Henry Nlssen Mil
ler, a rancher from Diamond Canyon, who
had just unloaded â¢ ton of hay at Manuel
Silva's barn. In some manner the two
Silva children lost their balance and fell
from the wagon. The rear wheel ran over
the baby's forehead, literally scalping her.
while Annie escaped with a bruised left
arm. Miller, the driver, called at the
City Prison late to-night and surrendered
himself. On the prison register he was
booked for manslaughter and was subse
quently released on his own recognizance.
The authorities regard him as entirely
blameless. The dead infant was removed
to the home of her parents and Coroner
Mehrmann has ordered an inquest to be
held to-morrow night.

CITY'S SUFFERERS.
Physicians Who Will Attend to the
Police Cases While the City-
Hospitals Remain
Closed.
Yesterday the board of directors of the
Mount Zion Hospital decided to open the
doors of its sanitarium to the city's suf
ferers and to set aside three beds for pub
lic use in an emergency hospital which
has been created at its institution. Since
the closing of the city hospitals the neces
sity of centrally located hospitals has
been seriously felt.
The physicians at the Mount Zion Hos
pital nave taken the action because of
the danger and inconvenience experienced
by patients during the past tew days.
They denounce the conveying of patients
who are in need of immediate treatment j
to the City and County Hospital as j
trifling- with life. The hospital conducted
by them is located on Sutter street, be
tween Scott and Devisadero, and can be
reached within a short time from the
Central police station.
Every unfortunate will be treated free
of charge at the institution. A star? of
experienced doctors and nurses will be
In attendance at all hours to wait upon
emergency cases, and the use of the beds
will be given as long as Is necessary to
the health of the sufferer. The doctor*
are under the direct supervision of Drs.
Levison and Rr.senstirn, and are among
the most proficient In the city.
A free vaccination department will also
be made a special feature. Any one may
apply for free vaccination and will re
ceive the sÂ»ame courtesies as would be
extended at a public institution. William
Haas is president of the hospital and E.
Haas is chairman of the hospital commit
tee.

BRILLIANT ILLUMINATION OF THE CITY IN HONOR OF CALIFORNIA'S FIGHTING FIRST
AND A MONSTER THEATRICAL BENEFIT TO SWELL THE FUND FOR A ROUSIG RECEPTION
MOHRIS MEYERFEI/IX
Managers of San Francisco Playhouses Who Have Combined to Make the Homecoming of the Regiment an Event That Will Go Down in the State's History.
PLAN'S for the reception of the
home-coming California volun
teers are 'under full headway, j
In addition to the labors already
undertaken to that end by the Native
Sons and Native Daughters and rela
tives of the Fig-hting First, the Citi-
Bens' Executive Committee is to make j
things more in the direction of a gen
eral public decoration.
Invitations were sent out yester
day by the executive committee to
about three hundred of the leading
merchants and professional men of
the city, requesting them to meet
â with the committee and help it form
a general citizens' committee to ;
finance the welcome. This meeting
will be held at 3 o'clock this after
noon in Judge Carroll Cook's cham
bers at the City Hall, when, it is ex
pected, the way will be pointed out
to raise the $50,000 deemed necessary
for a proper reception to the soldier
sons of the city and State.
The committee on decoration, of
which W. J. Martin is chairman, held
a meeting yesterday afternoon at j
which it was decided to report to the j
executive committee a general plan
for the illumination of the city on the
night of the volunteers' return. This
plan is a striking and original one j
and contemplates the employment of â 
electric lights by the tens of thou- ;
eands. It is proposed to outline the
ferry depot nnd tower with number
less incandescent lamps, to do like
wise with the dome and south front
of the City Hall facing Market street:
to span that great. thoroughfare with
festoons of many colored incandes
cents. so numerously strung as to
make a continuous archway of light
from the ferries to Van Ness avenue.
In addition, a dome of light to cover
the open space at the junction of
Geary. Kearny, Market and Third
streets is contemplated. It will have
all the significance, none of the trite
ness and ten times the attractiveness
of the stereotyped triumphal arch.
The committee decided also to call
upon the residents and business men
of the city to add to the official illum
ination by displays of lights in their
windows, candles and lanterns or in- ;
candescent lamps. It may also de-1
termins upon red fire illuminations
on Telegraph Hill and Twin Peaks, in
addition to displays of fireworks.
What daytime display the decora
tion committee may agree upon has
not been settled, but one thing is cer
tain and that is it is opposed to the
indiscriminate stringing of any old j
kind of bunting along or, across the
streets, and will request the mer
chants and householders of the city
to conform as far as possible with its
idea, which is that any decorations
Other- than flags will obscure the elec- ,
trical display.
While the decoration committee
was in session it received a cable
gram from Colonel Duboce, at Naga- j
saki. Japan, announcing that the '
boys were all well and sightseeing in
that vicinity- He said they would
arrange matters so as to reach the
Farallones at noon of whatever day j
it might happen to be.
The theatrical managers commit- |
tee also met yesterday and decided j
that their energies would best be bent
in the direction. of one grand benefit I
in which all the theaters could take
part. It will be given Thursday. Au

TRIUMPHANT MARCH
OF PENNSYLVANIANS
Ovation to the Men From the
Keystone State.
Ti*^ Pennsylvania regiment took ltf
place in camp at the Presidio yesterday,
after marching through the streets of
the city and receiving a reception as
cordial and prolonged as any that has
been given the returning volunteers.
It was 9:30 when the regiment came
out from the dock and turned up East
street. Awaiting it was the same detach
in. i.t of regulars that had escorted the
N. braaka and Utah men to the Presidio.
besides the Nebraska regiment and its
band and the band of the t'tah artillery.
The men of the -Pennsylvania regiment
had donned their blue suits, and they had
less of the appearance of troops returning
from the. tropics than had any of the men
who had preceded 'them. They had been
plentifully decorated with flowers and
marched well, and by their appearance
earned every note of applause which
greeted them.
And th^re was no lack of applause. Up
Market Btreet, on Golden Gate avenue and
along Van Ness avenue there was a va
riety of jubilant clamor which comes only
from a crowd bent on testifying to its
own enthusiasm. They went bo far as
to discharge shotguns and revolvers from
the windows of the wholesale houses
down town, mere cheering being consid
ered inadequate to the occasion.
On Van Ness avenue the regiment was
revk wed by General Shafter and his staff
and then it proceeded without further in
cident to the Presidio.
The reception committee from Pennsyl
vania had met the troops upon the wharf,
where they were welcomed by State Sen-
Muelbronner, who spoke briefly to
them on behalf of the commiti
There were, therefore, no ceremonies at
the Presidio and the regiment went into
quarters at once.
A substantial mark of esteem and sol
dierly brotherhood was shown by the Ne
braska miii as soon as the Pennsylvani
ans had been fairly settled. They invited
the Pennsylvanians to dinner, and com
pany by company the Easterners dined
with the men of the West, just as the Ne
braska men had dined with the men from
Oregon a few days before.
Early In the afternoon the baggage be
gan to arrive, and with it the customs in
spectors, who did their work in the com
pany streets. Each box as it came down
from the wagon was opened, examined
and passed, and at once Its owner stowed
it away in his own tent and settled him
self comfortably.
The mustering out of the regiment will
take three weeks anyway, unless some
unforeseen difficulty should delay matters
or unless specially hard and accurate
work should hurry it.
The committee of citizens from Penn
sylvania is extremely anxious that the
regiment should be released soon enough
to allow them to remain and go with it.
A number of the eommitteemen visited
Genera) Shafter yesterday to find out if
possible inst what time the mustering out
process was to be gone through with, but
the gen< ral was unwilling ty promise any
thing less than the three weeks. The offi
cers of the regiment have been working
on their papers all the way over from
Manila, but should these papers not be In
coTrect form 'they may have to be done
over again', and all the work so far com
pleted be lost. It is too soon, however, to
make any estimate of the time it will
A special committee of the committee
of Pennsylvanians consisting of J. A.
Herron "Harry" Hall, W. B. <'uthbert
son and Rufus H. Herron w*s -appointed
to draft resolutions of respect to the
memory of the late Colonel Hawkins. The
Bub-coabmlttee submitted its report to the
main committee yesterday, and it was
adopted. The report la as follows:
"Whereas, Pennsylvania's escort commit
tee appointed to meet and welcome the
Tenth Pennsylvania Volunteer Infantry on
Its return to the United States from the
Philippine Islands, has learned with the
deepest regret of the untimely death on
luly IS 1599. of Colonel Alexander 1,. Haw
kin*. commander of ifald regiment; therefore
be it â 
Resolved, That in the death of Colonel
Hawkins, Pennsylvania has lost a true
patriot, a brave Boldler, and an honorable
and esteemed dtlsen and the Tenth Regi
ment a commander whose courage inspired
Ita men lo duty whenever duty was demand
ed. His. constant Interest in and care for
hIR men. his unfailing devotion to their,
welfare, and his high example of duty as'
a soldier and a citizen have all conspired
to gain for htm b hold u]K>n their warm
est affections. - â 
Colonel Hawkins : was a gallant soldier
in the civil war, entering the ranks of the
army of. the Union as a private
in the Fifteenth Pennsylvania Cav
alry,, and by -his courage and stead
fastness in 'the performance ot every,
duty he won, by -successive promotion, the
rank of captain. , He had been for over
twenty-two- years an active member of the
National Guard of Pennsylvania, and for
twenty years colonel of the Tenth Regi
ment. Under his command, the Tenth was
among the nrst regiments to cross the Pa
cific Ocean, and carry the flag of his coun
try to the eastern hemisphere in the Span
ish-American war, in which it was the
first regiment to engage in battle with the
enemy. During the present conflict with
the Filipinos the Tenth was seventy-one
days on the firing line and participated In
all operations of the American army up to
April 13. 1599, and after that day was in
active duty at Cavite until the time of Its
departure for home. At all times Colonel
Hawkins was at his post.
Resolved, That this committee, as does
the whole people of Pennsylvania, most
deeply deplores his death, and tenders to
his sorrowing widow and fumlly Its heart
felt condolence In this grea: affliction.
Resolved, That a copy of this resolution

he sent to thÂ« family of the departed sol
dier.
Preparations for the funeral of- Colonel
Hawkins are still being delayed because
of the uncertainty of the departure- of th
regiment and the wishes of the relatives
of the deceased. Yesterday General Shaf
ter it ceived a telegram from Adjutant
General Corbin approving the plan of
sending the colonel's body East under the
escort of one of the officers of the regi
ment. The officer for this duty will be
detailed to-. lay and the body will start
East to-morrow.

vate office in the Phelan building. W. J
Martin, chairman of the committee, pre
sided, and the following members were
present: W. H. Mills, Charles Hirsch
(representing Henry Fortman), A. Schil
ling. I. W. Hellman Jr. and Harry Hol
hn ok. In calling the meeting to order
Chairman Martin said:
Gentlemen: Ah you are aware, the Board of
Supervisors recently appointed a committee,
itlns of his Honor, the Mayor, and a rep
resentative from each of the three morning
to act as an executive epmmitt," to
arrange for the reception of the California and
other volunteer troops returning fron > the
Philippines, especially the California Regi-
The executive committee has been meeting?
from time to time since its creation, nnd the
work ;is far as possible has been apportioned
out to the different members. General â ;â â 
young has been planed at the head of the
finance committee, and has selected as mem
bers representatives from the various mercan
tile and other Industries of San Frfi:
The duty of that committee will be to raise
the necessary money to cover all expenses in
cident to the reception by the citizens com
"VhTs' committee Is charged with the respon
sible duty of arranging suitable electrical
display and other decorations along the line
The people expect something out of the nsual
in the way of decorations on the occasion of
the return of the California Regiment. The
decorations will add. in a great measure to
the success of the undertaking, and therefore,
this "committee's responsibility is very great.
The question of two electrical arches across
Market street was decided upon by the execu
tive committee, provided, of course, that we
found it feasible, but the duty of this com
mittee not only covets electrical, but all other
decorations deemed necessary by the commit
tee.
For the further information of the
committee Mr. Martin said that the
general programme of the reception, so
far as arranged, provided first for a
naval parade", after which the men would
be landed as soon as possible and dined
by relatives at the ferry depot They
would then be marched to the Presidio as
Dart of a parade, the dimensions of which
could not be Btated at this time. The
same night or the night following the
programme called for a night parade and
a banquet at the ferry depot or Mechan
ics' Pavilion.
1 W. Hellman Jr. wanted to know what
money would be forthcoming for the needs
of tilt decoration committee. As it was
not possible to answer definitely it was
decided to listen to suggestions on decora
tion, decide on some plan and estimate
the cost.
"i have no -doubt." said Mr. Martin*
"that the funds will be forthcoming."
. "If thore is to be any daytime decora
tion." said Mr. Mills, "I would suggest
thnt it be limited to a display of national
colors, i am somewhat averse, personally,
to having a great wash of flags hung out
on clotheslines across the streets."
â¢'That suggestion agrees with the view
of the executive committee," said the
Chair. "We intend to prevent, as far as
possible, the stringing of banners across
the streets."
"As to night decorations," resumed Mr.
Mills, "the most beautiful effect I ever
saw anywhere was at Sacramento on the
night they inaugurated their light and"
power plant. The feature was an illumin
ation of the State Capitol. It was an out
line in lights of the entire building and
ill.- effect was extremely beautiful. The
south front of the City Hall in this city
pic-, nts a face that would lend itself to
a similar display. I made an estimate of
how many incandescent lights will be nec
essary, and 1 found It will take about
3000 so as to light the dome from the
lantern down to the first circle and to
outline the remaining portion of the
front."
Four thousand lamps, Mr. Mills estimat
ed, would be needed to treat the ferry de
pot in a similar manner and as many
more for the dome he proposed and a
rough drawing of which he submitted, in
tended to span the space at the intersec
tion of Kearny, Geary, Market and Third
streets.
The suggestions of Mr. Mills met with
general approval, as did one from Mr.
Schilling that the committee might in
vite merchants and householders to co
operate In the illumination by displays in
the windows of their places of business
and residences. Mr. Holhrook suggested
that circular letters be sent out asking
for such co-operation from private citi
zens and from the newspapers. He was
assured that the newspapers would at
tend to the matter wlthont solicitation.
In support of his suggestion for a tri
umphal dome of incandescent light Mr.
Mills said it would do away with the ne
cessity for a trliunphal arch, which nowa
days was generally a very tawdry wall
paper affair.
On motion it was decided to be the sen.se
of the committee that it report to the ex
ecutive committee recommending the Illu
mination of the ferry depot, the dome and
soutli front of the City Hall and the erec
tion of thÂ« iridescent dome, as suggested
by Mr. Mills.
It was also decided that the newspapers
be requested, as suggested by Mr. Schil
ling to co-operate with the decoration
committee in illuminating.
At this stage Mr. Hirsch advanced the
idea that the illumination would be great
ly enhanced by the stretching across
Market street, from the ferry depot to
Van Ness avenue, of strings of many
colored incandescent lamps. This sug
gestion also was received with favor.
Having arrived at these general agree
ments on plans the matter of expense
was considered. Chairman Martin stated
"DOC" LEAHY,
that representative? of the various local
el ctric Hght companies had been Invited
present and give figures. Herbert P
Thayer of the Ban Francisco Electrical
Company was the only one present. He
figured that each lamp in the quantity
desired would cost 10 cents, each socket .
10 cents and wiring, etc., enough more to
bring the cost of each light up to $1. He
said, however, that the lamps might be <
rented and was borne out in this by Mr.
Mills that there was one construction
company in the city that had 90.000 lamps
which might be rented. Figuring on this
basis Mr. Thayer was of opinion that the
illumination proposed might be done for
:â  $9000. He was invited to and prom
ised to lend his aid in securing figures for
the committee. Messrs. Mills. Hellman
and llolbrook were appointed a sub-com
mittee to figure the cost of illumination.
A i-uggestk.n from A. Schilling that an |
archway of laurel and palm be erected
near the transport dock for the California
boys to manh through on their re-entry
Into the city met with approval.
At this point in the proceedings a mes- '
senger arrived with the following mes- j
sage from the returning Californians:
NAGASAKI. Aug. 3, 1890.
Citizens' Committee, San Fran
cisco: Will programme Farallones
noon; command well; sightseeing in
Japan. DUBOCE.
Mr. Hellman suggested that the castle
on top of Telegraph Hill presented an op
portunity for effective decoration. The
chair stated that it was the intention to j
raise a number of large flags on it us a
greeting to the returning volunteers. Mr.
Mills suggested that it might be set afire.
The chair was of the opinion that Twin
Peaks should be illuminated with red fire
and Mr. Hellman spoke of a recent mag
nificent illumination of Mount Tamalpais.
but was met with the objection that fogs
might intervene to hide the view.
It .lot being deemed advisable to pro
ceed further without an estimate, on the
Illumination proposed the committee ad
journed to meet Saturday afternoon at 3
o'clock.
GRAND BENEFIT
FOR THE FUND
Theatrical Managers Put Their
Shoulders to the
Wheel.
A behemoth of a benefit, a continuous
performance, the like of which has never
before been attempted in the West, has
been arranged to swell the fund for the
proper reception of the returning Califor
nia boys. It will take place Thursday,
August 17, between the hours of 12:30 p.
m. and 6 p. m., at the Orpheum. The
cream of the dramatic talent in the city
at that time will appear in a bewild. riiit;
rion "f scenes calculated to more
than make up for the patriotic outlay.
There will be no waits, everything has
been set to jig time, and the managers of
Ban Francisco hope to clean up fcKwJ of
the $50,000 needed to hail the fighting i-'irst
on itn homecoming.
Here is the. programme, roughly out
lined:
The Columbia will present Henry Miller
and his company in one of their most
fetching acts.
The California will offer Miss Blanche
Bates and the Frawley company in an
other act of a successful play.
One aci of grand opera will be sung by
th( Tivoii company.
Miss Florence Roberts, White Whittlesey
and the Alcazar stock company will pre
sent 'â¢Only the Master Shall Blame."
The company from the Grand Opera
house will sing its merriest in an act of
comic, opera.
The Orpheum wil! offer as Interludes to
the operatic and dramatic numbers the
following star vaudeville attractions:
Alexandra Dagmar, the beautiful Rus
sian warbler; the great Cardownie tioup*
of dancers; Caron and Herbert, the fa
mous t-omnly acrobats; Mansfield and
Wilbur, in their novelty vaudeville sketcn;
Deonzo Brothers, the wonderful barrel
lets; Linton and Mclntyre, in their new
creation, "Doctor's Patient"; Bob Alden
and Strap Hill, the ragtime comedians,
Esmeralda, the wire queen, and the bio
graph.
The orchestras of all the theaters' will
take part. , , Â
Ten members of the managerial commit
tee met yesterday morning at the olHce
of the Columbia Theater. J. J. Gottlob
presided, and the others present were:
William Leahy of the Tivoii. Harry Mo
rosco of the "Grand Opera-house,- b red
Belasco and Mark Thuil of the Alcazar,
M. Meyerfeld and John Morrissey of the
Orpheum. S. H. Friedlander of the Cali
fornia and Sam Mott and Alf Ellinghouse
of the Alhambra.
They got down to business at once Mr.
Meyerf.M'l said he favored the suggestion
of Mr. Leahy, whfch contemplated one
great continuous performance. The oth
ers seemed to be of the same opinion, and
starting with this in view it was ea^y to
arrange the other details.
"I hear about benefits in the East." said
Mf-\ rft â¢ld.fwhero they take In $5000. I
think we can do that here."
"It looks thai way." said Mr. Gottlob.
"If you give H to the public good and
strong, as we propose to give it in this
monsu-r benefit they will turn out."
"Yes," said Mr. Morrissey, "we can give
them a continuous performance that will
open their eyes. Look at the tatent in
the various theaters in the city."
Having decided on a continuous per
formance to run from 12:30 o'clock on
some afternoon to 6 o'clock p. m., it was
decided that Thursday. August 17, would
be the best time. Then the managers
began figuring on a theater, it being final
ly decided that the choice lay between
the Orpheum and the Grand Opera-house.
Messrs. Moroseo and Meyerfeld were
asked to submit figures regarding their
houses, the seating capacity of which is
about equal. The decision in favor of the
Orpheum was reached on the suggestion
that it was more central than the Grand
Opera-house.
air. Meyerfeld then submitted a rough
estimate of the revenue to be derived
from seats.
"There are twenty-four large boxes in
the Orpheum." he said, "and the sug
gestion made by Mr. Friedlander that
they be auctioned is a good one. The
first box should bring at least ?250, and it

That's J4950."
Mr. Meverfeld concluded that there
would be no expense for lights or other
nrc-ssaries. the house standing that.
chairman Gottlob announced that the
Globe Printing Company had offered to
print tickets free of charge: that the
Sterett Printing Company offered to do
all the printing free and" that Siebe &
Green would charge nothing for bill post
ing. It was stated that the lithographing
houses would get out a souvenir pro
gramme for the glory of the thing.
George Lask r,r' the Tivoli was chosen as
general] stage manager of the big benefit.
S. H. Friedlander was appointed a com
mittee of one "n press and printing.
Messrs. Meverfeld. Gottlob and Leahy
were named as a committee on the sale of
seats. Fred Belasco, with a close shave,
will be expected to look after the prima
donnas and leading ladies, who are ex
pected to do great execution in the flower
selling line. Mark Thall will take care of
the souvenir programme.
It was decided to call on Superintendent
McLaren of Golden Gate Park for flow
ers, which the florists of the city will be
requested to make into bouquets free of
charge.
It was decided that the whole committee
should meet at the Columbia Theater
every morning at 11 o'clock until the
great day.
NATIVE SONS.
What They and the Daughters
Are Doing for the Re
ception.
The joint committee of the Native Sons
and Daughters mcl last night in the ban
quet Hall of the Native Sons" building.
A communication was received from the
Mechanics' Institute directors announcing
that it would be impossible to allow the
use of the Mechanics' Pavilion for the
committee on account of the fact that
the Pavilion is being prepared for the
fair.
The directors in another communication
asketl if some arrangement could not be
made to have a First California Regiment
night for the purpose of distributing the
medals to the volunteers. These com
munications were filed.
Entertainment committee No. 1 was
granted more time to make its final re
port.
K. D. Barton, president of the Pacific
Coast Musicians' Union, stated that his
union had offered a band of fifty pieces
to play during the day parade gratis and
that as since the tender the music com
mittee had hired a band for the recep
tion from another union, and as the hiring
was stiil in fnrce, he withdrew the offer
made, as he believed that in view of the
fenerous offer the music should have been
rom the union he represents, in view of
the fact that many of the members are
Native Sons.
Mrs. Mary E. Tillmann stated that she
had called on J. D. Bpreckels of the
Sprockets line: of tugs, who informed her
that while he could not then tell what tug
would be furnished he would inform the
committee through her that a tug of the
capacity of 150 would be reserved for the
use of the committee at the time that it
was needed. The report of Mrs. Till
mann was followed by a vote of thanks
to Mr. Spreckels for his generosity.
The report of the secretary of the re
ception committee as to what has been
done since the previous meeting of the
joint committee was read and adopted.
The meeting then adjourned to the call
of the chair.
At the California Hotel headquarters
yesterday the officials in charge received
a visit from John J. Cordy, grand sec
retary of the Grand Court of the Forest
ers of America, who called to haVe a
meeting of the representatives of the va
rious courts to be held August 8, attended
by a representative of the grand marshal,
to obtain information as to what the For
esters can do to take part in the parade
which the Native Sons and Daughters are
arranging. A representative was prom
ised.
Past Grand Master "Workman George
H. Bahrs and supreme representatives of
the Ancient Order of United Workmen,
it was announced, have issued an appeal'
to all the lodges in tho State to contribute
to the fund for the reception. In his ap
peal he says:
Now, therefore, with the approbation of the
Krar.fi master workman, I call 'upon the vari
ous lodges of our order to contribute to the
fund to be applied to the reception of our
gallant heroes irom Manila, out of their gen-'
eral fund, or from contributions among the
membership, as liberal a sum as possible, for
no money can be more loyally applied .than In
pro\ ing our appreciation of the sacriflce.3 and
heroism of our returning fathers, sons and
brothers, while in thr service of our common
country. The fact that they volunteered per
haps rendered our doing likewise unnecessary,
too much honor cannot be showered upon our
boys. If our membership could be induced to
contribute 10 cents per capita, we could soon
havo a fund of $21100 to be applied toward
doing homage to our returning heroes.
Are we unequal to this demand upon our
patriotism and liberality? I answer. No!
â¢As the brave boys will arrive in a little more
than two weeks from date, it Is of the high
est importance that the lodges act upon this
app'-al with great dispatch. All contributions
will please bÂ» forwarded to Brother Samuel
Booth, our grand receiver.
The Knights of the Maccabees are mov
ing in the matter and it is likely that
San Francisco, Golden West and Pacific
tents will take part in the celebration.
Bay City Parlor of the Native Sons of
the Golden West has accepted the invita
tion and promises a fine feature.
Mayor Phelan sent a letter of accept
ance of a place on the committee of the
Native Sons and Daughters.
The Fraternal Eagles have signified
their intention of making a display with
other societies.

A ROAST FOR ROSENBERG.
Oregon's Governor Replies to
His Letter Relating to the
Mustering Out of Sol
diers Here.
SALEM. Or., Aug-. 3.â Governor Geer
to-day received a circular from Edward
Rosenberg, secretary of the San Francisco
Labor Council, in the form of an appeal
to him to protest to the War Department
against the "criminal policy" of muster
ing out any more returning volunteers in
San Francisco. The circular states that
the labor market is being flooded and that
volunteers will be forced to re-enlist in
order to secure a living. This is the Gov
ernor's answer to Mr. Rosenberg:
T have been a workingman all my life and
while' all mv sympathy Is with that class of
fellow citizens at all times and everywhere,
your appeal In their interest is illogical, 111
--tempered, uncalled for and demagogical in the
exTreme. Your declaration that the War De
partment is moved by a desire to flood the
Faboâ¢ market and thus check the struggle of
the workingman for improved conditions is
absurd to I degree of imbecility, but equally
rational with the other statement that the
Government desires to compel volunteers driven
to want or destitution to re-enlist. â  â¢
Such demagogical utterances as these, which
are not only not based on facts, hut bear in
them unmistakable evidences of studied per
version, do the real laboring men of the
TJnfted States grave Injustice and in the end
'"to seize "such an occasion as the one above
noted to make Inflammatory and almost In
surrectionary ' appeals to our working people
indicates want of crood taste and good judg
ment and recklessness of statement that does
no credit to the organization engaged in its
prom-ulcation. The people of Oregon do not
share the sentiment of the circular for they
are sincere friends of the real worklngmen,
of whom there is not one who desires it now
out of employment in the State.
Former Comrades.
Quite a number of men who served in
the First California who were sent home
on account of physical disability, but
have since their return to this city fully
recovered, feel that they have been lost
sight of in the rush of preparation. They
say that. thÂ«y would like to escort their
former comrades on their return home if
they only knew to w* om they should
apply for permission to do so. If they
will "present their request at the head
quarters of the Native Sons and Daugh
ters in the California Hotel they will be
assigned a position in line.
Four hundred and fifty of the Pennsyl
vania men were entertained at the Or
pheum last evening. Tickets had been
sent out to the camp during the afternoon
ana they were dealt out to the men at
retreat. There was great hilarity when
the guests were announced from the
stage, and then when the band 'began to
play martial airs the tumult increased.
Dewey was cheered and the Orpheum and
Pennsylvania and San Francisco and a
great many others, but as with the other
men who have been similarly entertained
there were only groans and hisses for
Otis.
There was not a soldier who left his
seat before the end of the performance^
