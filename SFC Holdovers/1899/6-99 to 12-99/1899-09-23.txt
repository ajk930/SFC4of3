STATE OFFICER UNDER
FIRE OF ACCUSATION
Dr, F. F. Tebbets Is Charged
With a Serious Offense.
A Scandal in the State Board of Dental
Examiners Which the Governor
Sought to Suppress.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
DR. F. F. THBBETS. THE ACCUSED DENTAL EXAMINER
SACRAMENTO. Sept.. 22.â A scandal off
general State, interest is brewing in the
State Board of Dental Examiners. Dr.
F. F. Tebbets of this city, who Is one of
the members of the board, has' l;e?n ac
cused by one . of his associates of the
grossest misconduct, and after every ef
fort has been made to suppress the
charges and prevent publicity an investl
pation has been ordered: Dr, Tebbets baa
been charged. by his associate. Dr. Louis
T. Cranz. with having juggled with ..the
Important matter of Issuing diplomas.
This serious accusation has hung over j
Ijr. Tebbets' heau for weeks! but. his
friends have induced the Governor to prÂ«.-- j
v~nt an "investigation -until now. The j
complacency of the chief executive in the
affair ha.-? naturally excited v great dtal
of adverse comment.
In an interview to-night Dr. Tebbets in
sists that the whole affair grew out of a
rprsonal' 1 quarrel. This, huwt-ve'r. is not ,
the case,- Until recently the two dentists'
â wore friends. Then Dr. Cranz made his
accusations, which were based upon an j
interview and a discussion' which Dr. j
Tebbets had sought. After the charges j
bad been made the clash between Dr. TebJ j
b*ts and Dr. Cranz .came', the former i
threatening to kill his accuser. Serious
trouble between the two men was averted j
only by the timely interference at friends j
cf both.
Dr. Crar.z made his char- - to the Gov
ert or and demanded that an immediate in
vestigation be held and that Dr. Tebbets
be forced to resign. The Governor prom- j
ised that he would accede to the request.
He honored his prom in. his customary j
way by doing nothing. A State officer j
had been accused of a sr-riou? offense. An !
inquiry had been demanded, but the Gov- |
ernor, pledged by his oath of office to se
cure an honest administration of State j
departments, not only refused to make
an investigation but sought in every wa> {
to prevent one.
But Pr Cranz was persistent. He per
eevered in his appeals to the Governor
and finally secured from him another
promise that Dr. Tebbets would be forced
to resign or would be removed. Again
nothing was done by the Governor. The
friends of Dr. Tebbets meanwhile were
busy. They were Importuning the iren
who surround trie Governor to save the j
accused man from exposure. Letters
were sent by Chief of Police Dwyer and
others of this city to members of the Re
publican State Central Committee. .
All of this had the desired effect, out
row it Is understood that Dr. Cranz .n- j
t^ndÃ to force the retirement of Dr. Tib
bets, even at the expense of exposing the
scandal and resigning himself from the
board. Dr. F. H. lletcalf, who reslces
In Sacramento and Is also a member ot
the State Board of Dental Examiners, re
ceived a telegram from Dr. Cranz yester
day. In this telegram Dr. Cranz again j
demands an investigation of the Gover
nor's refusal tc act. ' , , ;
Dr. Metcalf says that he was unable
to reach the Governor to-day, but will
try to do so tomorrow. The affair nas
created considerable excitement in pro
fessional circles and all sorts of rumors
are afloat. There Is within the reach or
unscrupulous men who might occupy the
positions of State Dental Examiners an (
opportunity to traffic in dental" diploma*. .
The law permits wide discretion to the
examiners, as the following extract will
show:
"Any and all persons who shall so de- |
Eire may appear before said board at any
of Its regular meetings and be examined :
with reference to their knowledge and B
Ekill in dental surgery, and if the exami- i
nation of any such person or persons j
shall prove satisfactory* to said board the j
Board of Examiners shall issue to such
persons as they shall find to possess the
requisite qualifications a certificate to that
effect in accordance with the provisions
of this act. Said board shall also indorse
as satisfactory diplomas from any repu- !
table dental college when satisfied of the j
character of such Institution upon the
holder furnishing- evidence satisfactory to
the board of his or her right to the same,
and shall issue certificates to that effect
within ten days thereafter. All certifl
The San Francisco Call.
cares issued by said board shall be signed
"n'-iis Officers; and such certificates snali
be prima facie evidence of the right at
the hjilder to 'practice dentistry in the
State of California."
Rumor will cense, however, in a few
days, as it is promised that next Mon
day the long delayed Investigation will
be heldJ
Dr. P.. F. TeC'bets. who is a member of
the City B^arii of Trustees and also cf the
State 'ftenrd of Dental i^.vr.mir.frs. was
seen to-r.ight by The Call correspondent in
relation to ffie accusations that had
btcn made by. Dr. > C'ranz to the efrec:
that Tebbets t;ad been corrupt In the ad
miuistratir.n of his office.
J r. Tebbets did not wcome agitated
when the subject was presented to him
and he passed it off hurriedly, and flip
pantly in order to join a theater party
which was waiting in a carriage In front
cf his office. ' .
'â¢I emphatically deny every- charge
which <'rans liss made". against me," said
Dr. lebbets. "I have not given any diplo
ma.- for any conipccsation and I snali
demand a full investigation. This troub!^
between Crar.z and myself la purely per
sonal and has nothing .to do with the
Stau- Board. One night in San Francisco,
not very long ago. we attended a ban
quet and perhaps too much wine was
urunk. At any rate, hot words passes
between us; but that episode had nothing
to do with the State JJoard. Ever sine
then Craoz has beep pursuing that per
sonal affair. 1 had intended resigning m;
position on tre board, but sine*? accusa
tions have been rrmue against in I con
cluded thai it would be best to stand my
ground, a.i long as the trouble was only
of a personal nature."
That concluded the interview with Dr.
Tebbets, and he at once joined his theater
party".
Dt. F. 11. Metcalf, another member of
the State Board, was next seen at his?
residence at Twenty-sixth and N streets.
L>r. Metcalf was exceedingly reticent â in
fact, evasive, 'nut he admitted that there
wa.s troub:Â« and that accusations had been
made against Dr. Tebbets. Dr. Metcalf
did not want to discuss the matter. He
said h<* preferred to put It off until next
Monday. He was, he said, a friend of
Governor Gage, and was likewise a
friend, a neighbor, a lodge brother and
professional associate of Dr. Tebbets.
. Dr. Metcalf admitted he had received a
telegram from Dr. Cranz to Interview
the Governor. He had Intended having
the interview, but learned that the Gov
ernor was out of the city. Dr. Met calf
hoped no publicity would be given to the
matter, but in that wish he expressed a
hope that the Governor's feelings would
be spared. Dr. Metcalf would not make a
direct statement: His manner was of the
"silence gives consent" order. He said
that he â ad understood and expected
that Dr. TebbetÃ would resign. Dr. Met
caif said he expected to have an inter
view with the Governor to-morrow.

KRUGER AND STEYN IN
TELEGRAPHIC CONFERENCE
PRETORIA, Sept. 22.â President
j Kruger has been in telegraphic con
â  ference with President Steyn this af
; ternoon regarding the situation, and
' the decision of the Raad of the Orange
, Free State is awaited with interest.
; Large numbers of local Danes. Ger
mans, Frenchmen, Hollanders and
Americans have offered their services
to Commandant General Joubert in the
i event of hostilities.
The executive council sat until 5
o'clock last evening. A telegram con
taining President Stem's reply to Sir
Alfred Milner, the British High Com
missioner in South Africa, was loudly
cheered. '
A large order for horses has been
given in the Orange Free State.' The
field cornets say that in the event of
mobilization 4000 men will be available
at Pretoria alone.
It is reported that an experiment at
Zuurfontein with a locally manufac
tured dynamite gun resulted in the gun
bursting, though no one was injured.
A greenbook has been issued contain
ing the report of State Attorney Smuts
! to the Government on the pourparlers
: between himself and the British diplo
! matic agent, Mr. Conyngham Greene,
j leading- to the conditional five years'
' franchise proposal. Mr. Smuts asserts
; that the proposal was the result of a
; private discussion and an arrangement
i that both Governments should infor
; mally decide about the offer and its ac
; ceptance before the offer should be
J formally submitted. He also contends
; that the exact draft of the offer was
: wired to the British High Commis
| sioner, Sir Alfred Milner, and that the
j imperial Government sent a dispatch to
Mr. Greene which the latter interpreted
j as an acceptance of the offer.
Mr. Smuts says that had the Trans
i vaal known any difficulty would be
i made about suzerainty his Government
would n 'â¢'.'( r have made the proposals,
but would have probably immediately
accepted the invitation to a joint com
: mission of inquiry regarding the seven
â  year proposal. He also denies that he
promised Mr. Greene that the new
; members of the Raad would be allowed
'to speak English. All he said on this
â¢ sub.i â¢ he lares, was that the mat
; ter would easily settle itself, and he
shows that in the telegram to Sir Al
fred Milner no mention was made of
this subject.

SUCCESSFUL TEST OF
A SUBMARINE BOAT
GREENPORT, K. T.. Sept. 22.â The

Bay. The new diving apparatus for
operating the steering engines worked
successfully, the boat netting under

the boat over a mile course submerged,
at the end of wh.ich it came to the sur
face and the torpedo was discharged
from the tube. The run under the wa

the torpedo was successfully dis
charged from the tube, but, owing to
what is thought to have been a disar

the torpedo, instead of taking a
straight course, took a downward turn

Kruttschnitt and the Lawyer in
a Game That Failed,
Attempt to Force an Agent to Make Them
a Present of $100,000 Insurance
on Their Lives,
WILLIAM P. HERRIN. with one
foot on the brink of political
oblivion, and his side partner.
Julius Kruttschnitt. who is
â¢â¢killingly" economical in the
management of the Southern Pacific Com
pany, are threatened with a suit by a life
insurance agent, who would not take the
use of Herrin's name in lieu of the c I
hard cash due on two life insurance poli
cies Issued respectively to Herrin and
Kruttschnitt.
Herrin tried to convince the agent that
the mere fact of having his name on his
books was worth more than the amount
due on the policy and thought that if the
agent was "on to his job" he would make
him a handsome present for the privilege
of being able to say that he had issued a
policy on the life of the head of the law
department of the Southern Pacific Com
pany. The agent could not see it that
wayâ in fact, he was not going to do any
boasting over the fact that he had Her
rin as a client. He demanded his money
and declined to take anything else.
Kruttsehnitt was told by Herrin of th.?
outrageous treatment he had received
from the insurance man and stood in to
make the agent suffer for underestimat
ing the value of the Herrin name. Krutt
schnitt not only repudiated his note, siven
for the amount due. but tried to force the
agent to refund the money that had al
been paid on the policy. When the
insurance man refused' to be build
Kruttschnitt tried to force the issue by
filing a suit against the company to get
his money back.
Some months ago James B. Marvin, rep
resenting the Mutual Reserve Fund Life
Ass iatton of New York, learned that
Kruttschnitt had suddenly reached the
conclusion that hi? life was of some value
and that it was worth insuring. He
placed a figure on it of $50,006. Marvin,
in keeping with the reputation of life in
surance agents, allows no clew to a pos
:â¢ â  â¢ â¢ slip by without an investi
gation. He waited on the Southern Pa
â  'ompany's manager and placed be
fore him a scheme of life Insurance
Kruttschnitt said was something he had
been looking for almost since the day of
his birth. It suited him prvcffcely
hf to Marvin, and he ordered a $50,000
policy. One-half of the first year's pre
mium, a sum over $1000. was paid when
the application was signed, and the bal
ance, for which Kruttschnitt gave his
note, was to Call due when the policy
arrived from the home office of the in
surance company in the East. So far
everything was Lovely.
Kruttschnitt was so tickled over the
bargain he had struck that he let Herrin
in on the secret. Herrin figured that his
li:c was just as precious and valuable as
that of the general manager, and to prove
it he proposed to show that Kruttschnitt

who cculd get himself insured for V
Marvin was sent for and was somewhat
; to learn that Herrin desired to'in

j/olic as that for which Kruttsehnitt had

H> rrin paid one-half of the first year's
premium, but he did not give- his note for
the balance. A verbal promise to pungle

nn would cive. Marvin was a little skep
tical about doing business that way. but
Herrir s suave ways threw him off his
pixartl and he concluded to risk it. -?u!>
aequent developments showed that Herrin

MURDER COMMITTED
ON A THEATER STAGE
Julia Morrison of the "Mr. Plaster of
Paris" Company Shoots Man
ager Frank Leiden.
CHATTANOOGA. Term.. Sept. 22.â Julia Morrison, leading lady of the
"Mr. Plaster of Paris" farce comedy company, shot and killed Frank Lei
den, stage manager and leading man of the company, at 8 o'clock to-nieht
at the City Opera-house on the stage, just before the curtain mse for the
performance to begin. Three shots were fired at close range by the woman,
all taking effect in Leiden's head. He sank to the floor and was dead in a
few minutes. The woman was arrested and taken to the city jail. A Cor
oner's inquest was held, at which it was developed that trouble had ex
isted between Leider and Miss Morrison and to-day she slapped him. It
appears that they quarreled over the woman's alleged bad acting:. Leiden
accusing her of being an amateur. The woman claim? that Leiden repeated
ly insulted her. that he had made improper proposals to her, and in self
defense she shot him.
The verdict of the Coroner's tury was to the effect that the murder
was premeditated and wholly unjustifiable. The woman claims to be from
New Orleans, and a man with the company, named James, she claims as
her husband. James has been arrested as the instigator of the crime.
The sympathies of the entire company are with the murdered man. its
members claiming that the killing: was unjustifiable and that the woman
is an amateur and got Into the company by misrepresentation. The com

was not in his office, but Herrir. wa.s In
hip. Marvin was received with a'l
graclousness. Herrin talked about the
wr-a-her and tin I potatoes, but
carefully avoided the subject of life in
surance. The situation was becoming
painful and entirely unsatisfactory to
Marvin, so he undertook a fl-ank move
ment by leading up gradually to the mat
ter which had taken him to the yellow
building. He went at it easily and asked
Herrin how tho policy suited him.
â â Fir.'-' Beautiful! Elegant! Just the
thin? every m;.n should hare. Nobody
Id fear death with a policy like that,"
wr.- the ejaculations of the railroad at
torney.
Marvin grew bold at the sepd-off given
his goods and pulling the receipt from his
pocket hand:-d it to Herrin.
"Thank you." was all that came in re
turn.
The life insurance agent mentioned that
th^re was a balance due of some $500
which, of course, was a mere bagatelle to
Herrin. but which the life insurance com
led in us business.
The rage of Herrin at the suggestion
of money was terrible. Marvin trembled
as the attorney snorted around the room
until the pure* air of his office was im
pregnated with the sulphurous fumes that
arose from the awful little cuss words
tha; were applied to any insurance agent
i r i ompan; who d in ,1 to make a demand
upon him for payment for h policy.
"The idea, sir: I am surprised at your
audacity! Why I should be paid for al
tg my name to go on your books. It
is valuable to you for advertising pur
poses. I have paid you half of what this
policy calls for, and'that is one-half more
thanl should have paid you. My name is
Herrin and I am the head of the law de
partment of the Southern Pacific Com
pany."
Marvin insisted upon the money or the
return of, the policy, but got neither and
retired in disorder.
Herrin hurried cÂ» Kruttscnnltt and told
him of the utter folly of such gr^at men,
as they gave themselves credit for be
ing paying an insurance company for
the privilege of insuring their lives.
Kruttschnitt made up his mind right on
the spot to beat Herrin at his own gam" 1 .
He concluded to not only repudiate h*s
i.. it,., but to demand that the money be
bad raid originally be refunded to him.
If Herrin was going to get insurance for
half price, he intended to get it for noth
ing.
When Marvin called there was no pre
liminary sparring about the value of
names and such dreamy matters that flit
through the Ht-rria head. Kruttschnitt
the life insurance man up in true
Biark Bart style. He said he absolutely
note that was then
due. and further, that he wanted every
cent he had given the insurance company
returned to him at once or he would bring
suit for the amount. He intended to hold
on to the policy because it just suited
him.
Marvin explained that he was merely
the agent of the company and had no
authority to give their policies away for
nothing, as much a? he would like to ac
commodate Mr. Kruttschnitt. He left the
presence of the general manager sans
money and sans policy. Kruttschnitt
filed a suit against the company, as he
threatened, but when the bluff did not
work the action was r.ot pressed. Mar
vin placed the matter in the hands of
an attorney, with instructions to force
a settlement or a surrender of the poli
cies.
In some way the actions of Kruttschnitt
and Herrin were brought to the attention
of J. C. Btubbs. third vice president of
the Southern Pacific- Company, which is
just one vice presidency ahead of Krutt
schnitt. He has been endeavorir:
show the men their errors and has been
trying to persuade them to Bettle for thÂ»'ir
policies. He has asked for a few days in
which to argue the matter with them
if by that time they arc not dis
posed to pay up suits will be filed against
th< tn.
He said: "I am very much pleased
with the exhibition and am convinced
the boat can easily io all that is
claimed for it. I would rather be in the
Holland when under water than in the
engine or fire room of any of the fast
torpedo boats. I consider her ab
solutely saie."2

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 23, 1899.
GRAND ARMY VETERANS
PLEAD IN VAIN TO LEAD
THE DEWEY LAND PARADE
NEW YORK, Sept. 22.â Major Gen
eral Roe, who will command the
National Guard of New York
State in the Dewey land parade,
received a telegram from Gover
nor Roosevelt to-day directing
him to give the G. A. R. the choice of
any place In the parade. Immediately
on receiving the telegram, General Roe
had a conference with Mayor Van
Wyck, and then Chairman Guggenhei
mer of the Plan and Scope Committee,
which has charge of the parade, was
notified of the Governor's disp*atch.
After pointing out that his committee
alone had the right to assign the places
in the line of march, Mr. Guggenhelmer
said of the Governor's action: "It is
peculiarly Rooseveltian. It is most im
pudent, unjustified and unwarranted
Interference in a matter that is without
his province. I do not believe, how
ever, that our committee will take any
notice of it."
General Roe declined to discuss the
action of Governor Roosevelt in ad
vance of the action of the Plan and
Scope Committee.
It is paid that Governor Roosevelt
sent his telegram under a misappre
hension. General Roe is not acting in
his capacity as Major General com
manding the State militia, bu.t as chair
man of the Sub-committee on Land Pa
rade of the Dewey Celebration Com
mittee of this city.
At to-day's meeting' of the Plan and
Scope Committee, General Roe made
the following statement:
In order that there may be no misun
derstanding. I wish to make this state
ment in reference to the declination of
the G. A. R. to take part in the Admiral
Dewey land parade: On my representa
tion, at my instigation and on my reso
, lution 1 was authorized by this committee
to extend an invitation to the G. A. R.
of Greater New Fork to take part in the
parade by having a certain number of
men selected from each post, forming a
battalion of regiment, according to the
number. 1 put myself in communication
with the State commander as soon as
possible. At the request of a prominent
Grand Army man, I wrote and asked Gen
eral O. O. Howard to take command of
this body, being assured that this waa
agreeable to the State commander. At an
! Interview b< tween the State commander,
several members of the Grand Army and
myself 1 understood that the selection of
Gt-neral Howard was agreeable. At this
sani.- Interview, after some discussion, I
inform'^ th< m that the Grand Army
would In- assigned a position in the lead
of the unarmed organizations.
At a later Interview between the com
mander in chief of the Gr. A. R., the State
commander, Colonel Goulden, and myself
practically a demand was made that the
Grand Army should have the right of lino
â¢ .td of the column; colonel Goulden
stating that at a meeting held the day
in tore it waa the sentiment of the Grand
Army that if they could not have the
lead they would no< march. I called their
attention to the fact that it was not a
Grand Army affair, that It was a city af
fair, and that that position was not their
proper one, and said: "Positively and ab
solutely the Grand Army cannot have the
head of the column," whereupon they re
tired. At another interview the com
mander in chief, with the State com
mander present, Btated that he thought
Genera] Howard should not command the
Grand Army. I Informed him that he was
asked at the request of Beveral Grand
Army mÂ«n, !>ut i would write and ask
General Howard to withdraw, whereupon
the commander in chief said: "That is a
simple matter and can be easily ar
ranged."
Then he asked me If I wouivi allow n
picked body of 300 Grand Army men and
myself to have the lead of the column. I
answered: "l positively and absolutely
will not authorize, any portion of the
Grand Army to be at the head of the
column." Subsequently I received the let
ter of declination.
I havt taken the position from the be
ginning that tht day was emphatically
a navy day; that Admiral Dewey and the
Bailors of the Olympia .should be in the
lead, with nothing whatever to detract.
1 have taken this stand relative to thtr
Grand Army, as I am thoroughly con
vine, d 1 am right. 1 assume all respon
sibility. 1 do not ask the committee to
approve my. action, but abide by what I
have done. I nave the honor to be a mem
ber of the Grand Army of the Republic,
George Washington Post.
The committee agreed unanimously,
up' n the motion of Mr. Guggenheimer,
to approve the action taken by General
Roe. No mention was made of the dis
patch of Governor Roosevelt.
General Roe declined to give the text
of the dispatch to the reporters. It was
decided to abandon the proposed break
fast to the admiral at Claremont on
Saturday, September 30. The breakfast I
instead will be an informal one on the
boat conveying Admiral Dewey, the
Governors of States and other guests
from Barclay street to Claremont.
General Roe reported that he had
learned that Ohio had proposed to in
crease its representation from 800 to
3000 men. He suggested that in view of
the lack of funds the committee author
ize him to announce that no more or
ganizations would be accepted. A mo
tion to that effect was made and adopt
ed. The committee then adjo.urned.
General Albert D. Shaw, commander
in chief of the Grand Army of the Re
public, has issued an address to the
public, in which he says:
The reasons given in the letter from De
partment Commander Kay and presented
in person to General Koe embodied the
views I personally and strongly pressed
upon him and which should command the
place for the comrades in the line in
question. I made this request following
the precedent? of two States. First, in
Chicago, at the jubilee parade, the veter
ans were accorded the right Of line and
marched ahead of all nrmed troops; sec
ond, on the return of the Tenth Regiment,
Pennsylvania Volunteers, from the Phil
ippines the G. A. R. had the right of line
in Pittsburg, followed by the President
and Governors and their staffs.
In the light of these comparatively re
cent parades, the latter in honor of our
gallant soldiers who served in the Phil
ippines and who possibly heard some of
Admiral Dewey's guns, I could not but
feel that the Grand Army comrades of
New York, representative of the greatest
State of the Union, which sent more men
than any other State to preserve the na
tion from ruin, were as richly entitled to
head the line of the Dewey parade as
were the comrades of Pennsylvania to
lead a similar civil pageant in honor of
our Spanish-American war heroes; and I
felt when I made the plea that the prece
dent set by the State of Pennsylvania in
having the veterans lead the line. Presi
dent McKinley and the Governor of the
State following, was one that might bu
followed without any loss of dignity to
those controlling the Dewey parade in
New York.
1 wish to add that my only desire has
been to stand for the honor and dignity
of the Grand Army and 1 know I shall. not
be blamed by fair-minded and patriotic
citizens for doing my duty in this re
gpeci as I understand it. it gives mo the
greatest pleasure to extend to Governor
Theodore Roosevelt, as commander in
chief of 380,000 veterans of the G. A. R..
my warm congratulations on the just and
patriotic stand he has taken in behalf
of the aging veterans of tho nation in
using his influence to have their fust re
quest granted that they lead the parade
In the city of New York in honor of the
great Admiral Dewey. thus assuring to
our newest veterans that when they grow
old in their turn they shall not be the tail
of any public procession.
As Commander Kay says in his letter
to General Roe, "in their own time and in
their own way, the G. A. R. . as represen
tatives of the veterans Of the Civil War,
will render the homage that they feel
for their comrade and great admiral,
George Dewey."

It was reported to-day from Wash

friction will arise or that Rear Admiral
Howison will actually assume com

to this possible contingency have been
issued by the Navy Department, as it
was not supposed that the Chicago

ROOSEVELT WITHDRAWS
THE IGNORED TELEGRAM
UTICA. N. V., Sept. 22.â Regarding
tho dispute as to the position to be ac
corded the G. A. R. in the Dewey day
parade at New York, Governor Roose
velt said today:
I have telegraphed General Roe that if
the matter is one purely for the city au
thorities and one in which I have no
power, then, of course, I withdraw my
former telegram. I had understood that
General Roe was acting as major general
of the National Guard in the management
Of the parade and in that event I, of
course, had the power to direct that the
veterans be given tha right of the line
and accordingly did it. If, however, as
appears to be the case, it is a matter
purely for the city officials, I, of course,
have nothing to say and no advice to
give.

STOCKTON, Sept. 22.-The immense
crowd which journeyed to Agricultural
Park to-day saw a new record hung out.
The crash came in the final event, the
mile, and MoFarlane, who was left at the
post yesterday, was the animal to turn
the circle in the fast time of. 1:41 on a
trotting track. He has created two sen
sations up to date. The big bay was left
at the post yesterday, as Tullet pulled
him up as the barrier flew up and would
not let him go with the bunch. An inves

JERRY SIMPSON
Hissed Off the Stage for
Praising Filipinos.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
KANSAS CITY, Sept. 23.â A dispatch
to the Journal from Wichita, Kans., says:
Ex-Congressman Jerry Simpson was
hooted off the platform here this evening
â while addressing a local O. A. R. reunion-
Mr. Simpson said:
"I glory in the spunk of Aguinaldo's
men. They are simply fighting to regain
the land the Catholics took from them.
A local paper has asked: 'Who is John
Brown's soul marching withâ Otis or
Agulnaldo?'
"I believe John Brown's soul is march
ing with Aguinaldo."
Mr. Simpson said in substance that he
would rather be with Aguinaldo than with
General Otis. An old- soldier in the au
dience arose and said that the speech was
drifting too much into politics. This was
applauded and greeted with cries of
'â¢Throw him out!" and "Kick Simpson off
the platform!" Men and women arose and
hissed Simpson and the men kept cry
ing. "Put him out!"
Simpson appealed to the crowd to sit
down. "I am coming to my peroration."
he cried, although he had been speaking
only fifteen minutes. Cries came, "Take
your peroration to Aguinaldo."
Simpson attempted to go on, but no onÂ©
could hear him ten feet away. The band
struck up "The Star-spangled Banner"
and Mr. Simpson left the platform. His
retirement was greeted with prolonged
cheers. ____________

In the meantime, so long as the war continues,
there can be but two sides to it, and only one
is the American side. Where our flag and

THE POPE'S LETTER TO
THE BRAZILIAN BISHOP
Points Out the Value of Education
and Makes Many Suggestions
Upon the Subject.
PARIS. Sept. 22.-The Universe pub
lishes a .dispatch from Rome giving the
contents of the Pope's letter to the Bra
zilian Bishops, in which his Holiness com
pliments the Bishops on the progress
made. The Pope notes the increase in the
number of priesta and declares that it Is
necessary to still further increase the
number and to Improve existing semin
aries. He lays down rules for the educa
tion of the young clergy and points out
that they should interest themselves in
public affairs. He even advises leading
priests should enter Parliament, but says
they should do po without ambition for
themselves, acting modestly for the wel
fare of religion and the fatherland.
Methods for improving instruction are
pointed out and nopes are expressed that
the Brazilian faithful will supply the de
ficiencies. His Holiness advises each dio
cese to establish a tax for the develop
ment of education.

ecnl did not have much time to
give to "wireless graph? yester
day. Uncle Sam's customs officials
monopolized the greater part of his
day. and after the distinguished in
ventor had climbed up and down
the steep stairway of the Custom
house half a dozen times and zone
through the formalities necessary to
get his instruments into the country,
he turned with a weary smile and Jok
ingly asked. "When does the next
steamer start for Liverpool? This Is
too much rush for me."
Nevertheless the "wireless teleCTaph
man," as he was referred to by many
who recognized him from published
portraits and who pointed him out as
he passed through the streets, enjoyed
his f 4 rst view of the lower end of Man
hattan. He was especially impressed
by the monster buildings and their
swift-moving elevators, or "lifts." as
he designated them.
He was very desirous of srettine an
idea of the country around about New-
York, especially that part of it over
which his messages will fly during the
yacht races. A trip to the top of St.
Paul's building gave him this DDor
tunity, and he passed fuily half an
hour " studying it. conferring all the
â¢while with his assistants.
Sigr.or Marconi saw nothing that in
his opinion wouid interfere with send
ing messages by his system.
"I am not at all frightened by your
big steel buildings." he said. "Of course,
until I saw the city and country sur
rounding it. 1 preferred to say noth
ing as to the obstacles that have been
suggested by writers on this subject re
garding the successful working of
wireless telegraphy over a great city

am on the ground and have looked it
over I am more than ever convinced
that we will be successful in reporting
the yacht races for the Herald and

"I am also 100-king forward with
much pleasure to the experiments I am
to conduct for War and Navy depart

STANFORD GREETS HER
RETURNING WARRIORS
Boys Who Exchanged Books for the Rifle Come
Back to Their Alma Mater and Are Given a
Reception to Be Remembered for Years.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY. Sept. 22.
â Stanford University knows how

time the forty college soldiers

hour to-night when they retired
they were the recipients of as royal a
welcome as a great and warm-hearted
alma mater could give. That she is proud
of the records which- they made while
serving their country's flag they could no
longer doubt, if doubt it they ever did.
The reception committees met the train
carrying the Minnesota Regiment band
and the Stanford soldiers at Palo Alto and
escorted them over in carriages gay with
bunting. Almost the entire body of 1100
students awaited their arrival at the
"bleachers." As the buses rounded the
curve anil drove upon the field they were
greeted by the old " 'Rah! Rah: Staf

SKELETON BELIEVED TO
BE DUNHAM'S DISAPPEARS
Spot Where It Had Lain Is Found,
but the Bones Are
Gone.
GILROY. Sept. 22.â Sheriff R. J. Lang
ford and Deputy Sheriff W. H. Stayton
returned this afiernoon from the Pacheco
Pass country, where they have spent the
past week with young Keener an I his
father from Vlsalla, searching for the
skeleton found there by Keener three
weeks ago supposed to be that of mur
derer James Dunham. The spot where
the bones had lain was found nd unmis
takable signs of a body having laid there
for some time were visible, but the skele
ton was gone. The spot was in a very
pecluded canyon and had been overlooked
in the previous searches, although Rives
.-trrl T.nriL'ford had been within a hundred
yard 3of it.
ivÂ« ener and Stayton found the spot, ami
the story la verified by three disinterested
parties. Sheriff Langford Is of the opin
ion that the bones are either those of
Dunham and are being held for a big re
ward or that a murder may have been
committed and the murderer fearing de
tection ar.d arrest has buried the ghastly
proof of his crime. A man was missing
from Los Banos several months ago and
his whereabouts never discovered, and
it is supposed that he was murdered In
these mountains. In the meantime time
alone can solve this mountain mystery.

CHARLES SUISSER
HELD FOR TRIAL

Charged With Threats
Against Life.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
SALINAS, Sept. 22.â Charles Suisser.
brother of Sheriff Farley Flayer, was
takvn into Judge Dexters court to-day
for a preliminary hearing on the charge
of having threatened the life of James
Delany. From the testimony given to
day there Is little doubt that the two
Sulsser boys threatened Delany.
The trouble commenced last Sunday
when the two Suissers abused the old
man. At that time threats were made
by both, and whether or not the man
on trial to-day was with hi? brother j
when Delany was shot at and the barn i
fired waa not allowed in evidence. No
tnony whatever that pertained to i
George Suisser was allowed to-day.
When the defendant was on the stand
he several times made slips of the
tongue and gave evidence which may
prove damaging 10 his brother when he ,
is tried on the murder charge. The
elder Suisser when on the stand be- i
came quite excited. He has a violent !
temper and displays the same brag- j
gadocio air as his brother.
After hearing the evidence the mac- '
latrate held Suisser under a heavy
b ad
Excitement over the foul murder of
Sheriff Farley has by no means sub
sided, and all the Suisser family are I
subjected to unpleasant nrdeals and :
are being carefully watched by the of- I
fleers.
The stories current both here and in ,
San Jose that George Suisser will plead
temporary insanity are discredited by i
Corporal John Switzer spoke for the sol
dier?. "We are happy to be with you
and cannot tell you how we appreciate
the reception to-night. In Manila we had
to give receptions to ourselves. People
have said that we criticize too much. If
they would give us less excuse for criti
cism there would be less. Dr. Jordan
said that the boys who went to the front
went up against the real thing. Those
who got hold of any of the beef certainly
did."
In closing. Corporal SwltzÂ«r paid a deep
tribute to Major Tilden. terming him a
man in the army as well as out.
Major Tilden being called on, said that
he had been a Stanford man ever since
Dr. Jordan had become Its president. 'He
had forty Stanford soldiers in his com
mand and knew the stuff they were made
of. "I know a University of California
man," he said, "who wore the cardinal
with pride on the day that the First Cali
fornia Regiment sailed from San Fran
cisco. I am proud that the Stanford men
went as volunteers, for I fear that if
some of the officers I have seen down
there had to go as volunteers they would
never go. I have been asked if the col
lege man made* a good soldier. As an
answer I can refer any who doubt it to
the records of the young fellows I had
the honor to command."
One of the pleasant features of the
evening was the open air concert fur
nished by the Minnesota band, which
was a special guest of the university.

in the San Jose Jail. It is as follows:
"Dear Motherâ l have got you in lots
of trouble. But don't worry about me.
I did not want to kill Mr. Farley. I
wanted to kill Mr. Allen. Will you
come up here and see me? Jim
Church hap got my shotgun. I left the
rifle on the porch."
The Board of Supervisors will meet
in special session on Monday to appoint
a Sheriff to fill the vacancy caused by
Farley's death. There are numerous
candidates for the position, but it is
presumed that N. R. Keef. deputy un
der Farley, will be appointed. Mr. Keef
was the friend of Mr. Farley since boy
hood, and it was he who captured the
murderer on the eventful nierht and
drove around the county all night with
him in a buggy. Keef's chief opponent
is Harry Gordon of Monterey.
PORTO RICAN EXILES
REACH SAN DOMINGO
Their , Return Creates Enthusiasm
Among the Populace and They
Are Well Received.
PAN DOMINGO. Sept. 22.â A warship
from Porto Rico with forty political exilra
on board arrived here to-day. The return
of the exiles aroused much enthusia^-n
anr-i.g the populace. The decree of ih-
Government fixing: October 6 to October
8 for the primary elections and providing
for the meeting of the electoral college
during the last week of October, although
a revolutionary action and against the
constitution, has been well received. The
Government's action was ratified by a
popular demonstration, the crowds cry
ir.cr "Down with the constitution. "
There was apparently no opposition to
the decree. Officers will be elected for the
full term, four years. Jimenes is the only
candidate for the Presidency of the re
public.

abroad a mild scare or two as to the sup

persons interested in keeping up the ex

There is a reason for everything, and the reason for the popularity of Beecham's Pills *
is, that they fill all the requirements of a general antidote for ALL BILIOUS AND :
NERVOUS DISORDERS in a more satisfactory manner than any proprietary medicine ;
ever placed before the public. Beecham's Pills are brought before your notice, and, :
whether you require them or notâ if not today, you may tomorrowâ when the necessity !
arises you should, in your own interest, take them. The reason for their need is often :
best known to yourself, but be that as it may. you will show good judgment by taking s
them in reasonable doses, and doing so is as simple as AÂ£ C. â  :

The three box cars back of the freight
engine undoubtedly saved many lives. The
excursion engine was broken in two and
telescoped into one of the box cars. The
excursionists were badly shaken up and a
number bruised. The wife of Conductor
Johnson was struck by flying timber but
not badly injured. She had Just changed
her seat and the one she left was crushed
into fragments.
Some of the frightened passengers
jumped from the windows and It is simply
marvelous that so few were injured. A
box car caught fire but was quickly ex
tinguished. A wrecking engine sent down
a little later ran into a part of the wreck,
but did little 1 damage.
The excursion train had right of way.
but the men in the freight engine had not
been notified of its coming.
RESIGNATION OF
SHELL ASKED FOR
Charges Presented to;
the Conference by
Epworth League.
Dispatch t:> The Call.
LOS ANGELES, Sept EL-rAt this morn
ing's conference of the Methodist Episco
pal church the question as to whether
Rev. Edwin A. Shell, general secretary
of the Epworth League, should be asKed
to resign his position was debated. The
report in which the conference was rec
ommended to ask for Rev. Mr. Shell's
r -icr.ation was submitted by he lip
worth League committee and was sub
jected to a general overhauling by mem
bers of the conference before it was
finally adopted. The report stated that
the number of active members is 4o>"\
members S>>J and juniors 3500.
The report indorses the appointment of
H. W. Waltz as field secretary for the
- le and requests that every Friday u e
n over to Epworth Leagn:-=- work.
During the debate on the report the
story of Rev. Mr. Shell's alleged unoffi
cial conduct was gone into. Charges were
made before the conference, to which he
belongs, that he had used his official in
fluence to servr personal end? in â  â 
ing into a contract with Hymn-writer
Excell to assist in the sale of the latter'a
â "Songs For Young Penpie." provid
ed Excell would give him part of the roy
alty. As the contract was secret many
persons believe that Shell was guilty at
least of a grave indiscretion in appro
priating money thai should have gone
into the treasury of the Bo*">k C I
and finally into the fund for the support
of superannuated ministers.
Other members of the Methodist confer
ence say that the Book Concern did not
suffer a loss by the contract, but that
Excell was to have paid Shell out of his
own money. However this may be, a ma
jority of the ministers assert that Shell
was looking out for his own interests
rather than for those of the church, and
declare that he is not a fit person to be
at the head of the Epworth League move
ment.

MRS. CRAVEN MEETS
ANOTHER REVERSE
JUDGE TROUTT REFUSES TO
SUMMON A JURY.
: Alleged Widow of James G. Fair
Must Prosecute Her Demand for
â¢ Family Allowance Without
an Advisory Body.
Nettie R. Craven Is meeting with a
series of reverses before Judge Troutt
that would completely discourage a less
persistent litigant. A short time ago
Judge Troutt refused her petition, for
costs of advertising her suit agafn^t- the
Fair estate. Thursday the court refused
her motion to sot aside a decree of partial
distribution of Fair properties heretofore
made and yesterday the alleged widow of
I the dead capitalist was denied the priv
ilege of submitting her application for a
family allowance from the estate to a
jury for decision.
When the hour for the consideration of
I the motion arrived Mrs. Craven was pres
j ent in court with her attorneys, W. W.
Foote. Lafe Ponce and Judge ' Denson.
: The executors of the decedent's last will
i and the heirs and devisees were repre
sented by William "Wood. M. B. Wil
son, William M. Pierson and Charles Heg
: gerty. Mr. Foote addressed the court and
said that he would not argue the motion
; for a jury, but would submit the motion
! for decision, as it appeared on the peti
! tion. Judge Troutt then denied the, mo
tion. An order was then made by the
I court granting Mrs. Craven five days
â  within which to amend her petition to
Bet aside the decree of partial distribu
i tion. Hence this matter will again be
argued before a final decision is reached.
Lafe Pence requested that hereafter,
â  when motions by opposing counsel were,
â  made on any matters pertaining to the
I Fair estate Mrs. Craven, who was obvi
ously a party litigant, should be served
with notice. This request was consented
, to and November 14 was set as the date
| for hearing the application for family al
lowance. - . -

Hawaii.
Special Correspon<Jence of The Call.
HONOLULU, Sept. 15.â The British
tramp steamer Victoria, whose cargo of
i emigrants for this port has been the sub
! ject cf a good deal of international diplo- ;
i matic discussion, arrived here on the 13th.
Instead of nearly 100 Portuguese and
Spanish emigrants who had signed to take
passage on her she brings only o4J.
: Through the action of the American Con
sul at Madeira the company â¢which
shipped the men and women is out the ad
â  vances made for 200 of them who refund
' to Fhip when Consul Jones told them their
labor contracts were useless.
Before the Victoria left Madeira Consul
j Jones took occasion to notify the men and
' women who had signed to leave their na
i tive land for the sugar plantations of
Hawaii that the islands had been annexed
to the United States and that the labor
contracts they had made would not hold.
The prospective emigrants were informed
that they would be landed at Honolulu
and would have to take their chances of
, getting work after they arrived. Two hun-
I dred of the men and women who had
shipped deserted the vessel. The Victoria
left port with the remainder, after lodg
ing a vigorous protest against the action
of the Consul.
On the vessel were 205 men, 5 1 " women
and 82 children. During the trip three
i births and one death occurred and four
j teen stowaways were found.
The emigrants are in charge of Thomas
E. Ivena, representative of the firm of
Nathan & Co., London, by whom the con- [
tracts with the laborers were made. !
j Through the British Government Nathan
1 & Co. protected to the Government at
Washington against the loss they had
sustained by reason of the American Con
sul's action. The result was an Investi
rntlcn "Â»hicli resulted in a decision that
Consul Jones was wrong in his course.
When seen Mr. Iv&r.6 paid that he did
not know what action his company is tak
ing In the matter. It is understood that a
claim for damages is being- made. "Con
sul Jones was certainly wjong in the pri
es he u>ok." paid Mr. Iv-ne. and
It cost us a considerable sum. An advan-.e
had been made to each of the 200 men who
! deserted rur \essel and we lobi that. Be
â  'J- c we are out money spent for pro
visions for them on the journey and we .
used our steamer for a load far below her
capacity. "
W. H. Marshall is in Jail here, charg-d
with criminal libel. Th*> Government
caused the arrest. Marshal Brown being
the complainant. The case has g'~ne over
j until the 80th. In the meantime Marshall
is confined, be being unable to furnish i
JIOO9 bail money. Marshall has been con- j
ducting a Sunday paper called the Vol
cano. Hia associate is Ben Napthaly, a
former San Francisco attorney, who was
disbarred for iik-gal practice. Marshall
I has been very 1 itter in attacking the best |
in--n in this community. For several
weeks he has grossly libeled Chief Justice
Judd. That official took no steps to pros- j
ecute. On August 27 Marshall again at- i
i tacked the Jurist In a criminal manner.
i The feeling in the community waa a i
i ftrong that the printers declined t<> issue
j the papi-r nny longer. In the meantime
the Government took the matter up and
caused the arrest of the editor. Marshall
came here some months ago. He was
formerly a resident of Sacramento. CaL
It is claimed here that he was forced to
leave that city for his attempt to black
mail several business men.
While turning around the spar buoy to
enter port on the morning of the 13th the
steamer Alameda cut downÂ»two fishing
lunks. Twelve Chinese were precipitated
"into the water and one was drowned. The
body was not recovered, and may never
be, *rb the accident occurred in the shark
district outside the reef.
Judge Alfred S. Hartwell has been
chosen by the Government to represent
the Territory of Hawaii unofficially in
Washington "during the coming Congress.
The appointee will leave for his post in
time for the opentnp of Congress In De

EXTENSION OF
DONAHUE ROAD
Original Plan Will Not
Be Changed.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
BANTA ROSA, Sept. 22.â 1t Is learned
here to-day that the committee of Mendo
-1 cino County citizens who a few days slmo
visited President A. W. Foster of the Cal
ifornia Northwestern Railway In the hope
of being able to influt-r.ee the company
to change its present plan'of building the
proposed branch line into the redwoods
of Mendocino County from a point above
Cloverdale so as to have the branch con
nect with the ma'.n road at Ukiah met
with very little encouragement.
It is expected that work on the new
branch will be commenced early !n Oc
tober. The surveys have all been mid-:
and grade stakes are now being set out
along the entire route. The new road will
leave the main line at Astl and pene
trating the rich Dry Creek Valley will fol
low the banks of Rancheria Creek to its
junction with Indian Creek and thence
down the latter to the town of Christine,
in Mendocino County. Near here the
company has 25.000 acres of virgin timber
land under bond and it Is stated upon
what appears to be excellent authority
that a company is now being organized to
build and operate mills in several por
tions of this immense tract.
The report is current here that the
money necessary for the construction of
this new branch, which will approximate
$1,000,000, is now on deposit to the com
pany's credit in a San Francisco bank and
available for the purpose.
If the plans of the railroad people are
realized the new road will eventually oe
extended to Eureka. In this event the
branch will become the main line and
the present main line to Ukiah will be
come a branch or spur of the main road.
The possibility of being sidetracked in
this manner served, as much as anything
else, to stir to action the people of that
place.
DISAPPOINTING RACE.
Roan Wilkes Defeats Rubenstein
and Frank Bogash.
READYILLE. Mass.. Sept. 22.â The
feature of the mating of the New Eng
land trotting-horse breeders to-day was
th^ 2:04 pace. In which Roan Wilkes, Ru
benstein and Frank Bogash were entered.
The horses looked well, but In no heat
excepting the first half of the second mile,
paced in 1:02, was anything like good time
made. Roan Wiikt-s was steady but did
not have to go, Frank Bogash meeting
with a mishap and being distanced in the
first heat, while Ruoenstein never went
his ga.lt for more than a half.
Roan Wilkes won the race in straight
heats, Rubinstein second. Beat time
2:06%. Roan Wilkes received llrst and
third money.
LOWERS BIKE RECORD.
C. C. Holzell of Spokane Pedals a Mile
Paced in 1:35 1-2.
SPOKANE. Wash., Sept. 22.â C. C. Hol
zr-li of this city to-day lowered the world's
amateur record of one mile on a bicycle.
Three judges and three timers certify that
he covered the mile in 1:35%. The pre
vious record, human paced, was 1:39. One
of the Judges is superintendent of the Y.
M. C. A. here and one of the timers is
athletic director of the association. The
effort was made against time, paced and
with flying start.
Poolrooms to Keep Open.
BAT'SALITO. Sept. Broyer &
Glynn's poolrooms were closed down to
day on account of the opening of the
Oakland race track. It has been decided
to sell pools on Eastern races at Joe
Harvey's poolrooms during the winter,
Broyer & Glynn to share in the profits.
The reason for the unusual departure in
keeping one of the betting establishments
open during the winter Is said to be the
enormous profits realized this summer,
many asserting that each of the pool
rooms has netted $50,000. The anti-gam
bling element is incensed at the prospect
of poolrooms the year round, but has
met with so many defeats in the attempt
to suppress them that it is unlikely any 1
further effort will be made in that direc- i
tion. _'"

Delegates to American
Institute.
Social Disiwch tn The Call.
PORTLAND. Ore., Sept. 22.-A party of
sixty delegates and their wives and
daughters passed through this city to
day en route to San Francisco to attend
the convention of the American Institute
of Mining Engineers. They took the spe
cial leaving Portland at 6:15 p. m. Among
the number are Dr. James Douglas, pres
ident of the Institute; Dr. R. W. Ray
mond, secretary, and Theodore Dwight,
assistant secretary. Dr. Raymond is a
mining expert of great ability and has
figured in some of the greatest mining
deals of the country. Both he and Dr.
Douglas, who is also possessed of national
fame in mining engineering, are interest
ed in considerable mir.ing properties in
the northern and northwestern part of the
country. Dr. Ernst Fleming, a member
of the Royal Prussian start; Dr. Otto
Meahlheauser, well known in German
mining engineering circles; Professor N.
W. Lord of the Ohio University and Pro
fessors Heinrich Ries, Cornell University,
are members of the party. Representa
tives from the East, ranada and some
parts of the Northwest and British
Columbia constitute the- major portion of
the number, which is smaller by half than
was expected, cwing to the press of busi
ness at this season.
Secretary Raymond states that a part
of the business to be transacted will be
the admittance of 125 new members,
whose applications axe now on file.

TAHOE EXCURSION
ENDS THE SEASON
It Promises to Be a Very Brilliant
Affair.
The proposed excursion to I-ake Ta
hoe which the Southern Pacific has an
nounced for Saturday, October 7, prom
ises to be a brilliant close to the most
brilliant excursion season which the
State has ever known. The extreme
cheapness of the rate is of course the
merit of the event. Ten dollars for i
trip of this kind, including sleeping car
expenses for two nights, is absurdly
low, and places the delights of one of
the most famous resorts in the world
easily within reach of the pleasure
going public.
Excursions of this kind are always
select and first class, and have the ad
vantage of a manager who looks aft^r
the comfort and entertainment of his
guests. Mr. "William H. Menton, the
company's experienced excursion man
ager, will be in command on this occa
sion. Secure tickets and sleeping car
accommodations at 613 Market street.

In the Fog.
The Harbor Hospital was kept busy yes
tprday with water front cases. Thomas
Nelson required nine stitches to draw his
scalp together and four to sew up his
lacerated ear. He was picked up in an
unconscious condition on East street and
fsken to the hospital. When he came to
he said he had been assaulted and robbed.
The police are investigating the case.
Captain Roberts slipped on some iron
sheeting and nearly fractured his skull

Jeremiah Creden nearly had his skull
cracked at the Folsom-street bunkers. A
lump of coal fell on his head and it took:
six stitches to close the resulting lacera

This Week's Wasp.
This -week's Wasp is so especially bright
and interesting that it is almost woii
the name of a special edition. Some choice
views of the presentation of medals to
California's heroes are sure to attract in
terest. Particularly worthy of mention ara
the four "half-tone" illustrations of tha
night in Venice at Belvedere, showing
what can be done nowadays in the way of
photographing after dark. It is said oC
the Wasp that it produces the best photo
engraving work west of the Rockies. Sen
ator Mulrooney writes in his whimsically
humorous style of the political situation
in San Francisco. An instructive article
on the oil wells of California, profusely
Illustrated, is quite a feature of the issue.
Stories, poems, storiettes, incisive musi

cisms, together with attractively written
financial comments, complete a number
far ahead of all contemporary weekly
magazines.

SAN FRANCISCO DEWEY DAY.
ZZ^VERY proper elTort was made to induce Ad
miral Dewey to touch his country first at San
â â * Francisco and cross overland, giving his ad
miring countrymen in the non-maritime States an op
portunity to honor him according to his due. These
efforts failed. That they were made at all was more
for the purpose of testimony to the esteem in which
he is held than in the expectation that the grim old
descendant of the Vikings would exchange his ship
for a palace cir on his way to report at official head
quarters. His courteous answers to all our invita
tions are set like jewels among the treasures of those
who received them, and are held to be sufficient com
pensation for the pains taken to let him know how
we felt toward him.
But has all been done that San Francisco owes to
him? When poor old demented George 111 of Eng
land lay in physical and mental helplessness, guarded
on his royal couch, one day the great guns boomed
from the Tower, and among their echoes mingled
the roar of other artillery. The stricken King,
roused by the noise, asked why the salutes were fired,
and was told that it was in honor of the anniversary
of one of the battles won in the crisis of the nation's
destiny. Rising in his bed the King cried: "It was
a gTeat day tor England!" The battle of Manila Bay
was a great day for America. The day on which the
hero of that battle is honored on his return is great
for America everywhere, and the coldest heart must
boat faster in time to its meaning. Only the cities that
are arour.<l New York harbor are in physical touch
with it. Only their people will see the pageant, fire
at the touch of its enthusiasm and live to cherish the
day's memory among the things that gild the past
with a light that nothing else can kindle.
But that is not enough. The great Admiral went
into Eastern waters in defense of San Francisco. No
matter what we know now. Then we knew that an
unfettered and unresisted squadron of Spanish war
ships was a paralyzing threat to this port and city.
The Government was so hard pushed by that risk that
it acquired and prepared to arm merchant craft to
stand between us and destruction. Our merchants,
with argosies at Â«ea, went to nightly slumber uncer
tain whether at dawn they would still have their own
which was afloat or whether it was gathered into the
greedy maw of our enemy. Then came the fight in
that far bay, and the fleet of Montijo was besomed off
the seaa. More than any other people on the conti
nent we owe to Dewey some expression of our grati
tude for the fear he turned into courage, for the de
spair thundered by his guns into joy.
It is an honor to propose that on the day of his re
ception in New York there be an expression of San
Francisco's feeling for the hero and his deeds. The
committee which managed the marvelous reception
to our own volunteers has on hand a surplus of many
thousand dollars. There has been much discussion as
to the manner of its disposition. A portion of it
should be used In observance here of Dewey day. We
have in camp nearly 15,000 soldiers. They are rest
less in their pent quarters and camp, Let the com
mittee provide music, all the bands in the city if
need be, and call out such organizations as can add
to the spectacle, and let us have a grand military pa
rade in honor of the hero of Manila Bay.
At the close of the Civil War two hundred thousand
veteran troops marched down Pennsylvania avenue
In review before Grant, Sherman and Sheridan. The
cotmtry and the world will never forget it. The in
spiration of that day survived as the fire of patriot
ism in tens of thousands of hearts.
The Spanish war is over. Let the troops that are
with us pass in review in celebration of the greatest
achievement of that war on the water. And as the
marching and the music pass let the sentiment of all
hearts be:
May the aervlce united ne'er sever,
But e'er to their colors prove true|
The army and navy forever.
Three cheers for the red, white and hlue.
The committee should at once institute the meas
ures needed, secure the consent of the War Depart
ment to the parade of the troops, the presence of
the bluejackets from the warships, and of civic organ
izations which may add to the scene, and give to
Dewey day an expression that will show forth our
thanks for what the Admiral did for San Francisco.
To such use of some of the funds of reception dny
there will be enthusiastic and patriotic assent and ap
proval, and part of the problem before the commit
tee will be happily solved,
TIIE SAX FKANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 23, 1899.
ORIENTAL TRADE.
WE don't know by what extent of commercial
experience Mr. John Barrett earned the title
of "an expert in oriental trade." He appears
before Chambers of Commerce to declaim on that
subject, but he leaves one in doubt as to the real ob
ject of his mission. In his address to the merchants
j of this city on Thursday he advertised the fact that
he subscribed to the Dewey monument fund and the
fund to receive the First California, and then seemed
to assert that our oriental trade depends on imme
diately electing a Senator from California. Mr. Bar
rett is a gentleman who enjoys large and multiplied
contacts with public men; we do not accuse him of
this, for he admits it, and he said that throughout the
1 East the Senators and Representatives whom he had
the honor and privilege of knowing had unanimously
deplored the fact that California has only one Sena
tor, and, inferentially, had requested him to include
our Senatorship in his great mission of setting things
j right. He fears that only another Senator from here
I can dig the Nicaragua canal, and is sure that we will
{ mourn for oriental commerce as those without hope
unless that canal is completed.
For the present we take this part of his address on
! commerce for a brief review. He pointed out as "an
' anomaly in transportation the fact that a great part
of the American trade with the Orient is done from
Xcw York, and not from Pacific ports, which are so
much nearer," and at the same time mixed another
I Senator and the canal together as a remedy.
The west coast of South America lies east of New
York. When the canal is built that coast will be
r.rnrer to New York than to San Francisco. There
fore, if nearness is an element in the problem, New
York will do the trade of that coast which we do now.
Again, New York's trade with the Orient now has
to go around Cape Horn or the Cape of Good Hope,
or, avoiding this doubling of either continent, it
passes the pillars of Hercules and travels by the.
, Mediterranean and the Suez canal. When the Nicar
agua canal is built San Francisco will be no nearer
the Orient than now, but the distance from New
York to the Orient will be cut one half! It would
i seem that Mr. Barrett carries his original system of
logic in international politics into his statement of
I commercial problems.
Perhaps the labor of travel in many countries and
the interesting and often thrilling personal expe
riences involved, none of which he attempts to con
ceal, have so occupied his time that he can only appear
I in the upper air of commerce, and has had no leisure
to devote to that part of the subject that is of the
earth, earthy.
In commerce transportation begins at the point
where the article exchanged is produced. The Orient
! may want Indian corn, raised in the Mississippi Val
ley, and when an isthmian canal is built it will go
down the Mississippi River, through the canal and
away, and San Francisco will never see it. This i*
! to illustrate the fact that if New York control now the
American trade of the Orient it is because within the
zone of production that pours its surplus into that
city for export there are produced the articles of com
' merce which oriental trade demands. San Francisco
i has a zone of production whose surplus comes here
, for export. That zone is nearer the Orient than the
i one which outlets through New York, but if it does
I not produce what the Orient wants nor consume what
'. the Orient has to exchange, it might be next door to
the oriental market and yet have no oriental trade.
j Seaports, canals and oceans don't trade with each
; other; as physical objects they have no exchanges.
They are the facilities- for use of peoples who trade
with each other.
Therefore, to swell our oriental trade we don't need
Senators, useful and nice though they be. We need
to produce more of what the Orient consumes and
; consume more of what the Orient produces, and in
' proportion' as we do this our trade will swell.
The Nicaragua canal is not a factor in the oriental
trade of this city. We want it built in order to profit
ably export lumber, base ores and other of our do
mestic products which do not bear long rail transit.
But as far as our oriental contracts and South Ameri
can trade are concerned the canal will take commerce
away from us. Mr. Barrett does not digest all his
facts together and present the resulting nutriment,
rejecting the waste. After kindly advising us in do
mestic politic=, and upon the canal, he said: "You
know, as practical merchants, that it is cheaper to
i carry anything in the bottom of a ship than it is
; across a great stretch of country in a railroad train."
Commerce from the Orient comes here now for rail
i transit East, and figures in the forty millions of for
eign trade of this city in the past seven months,
rather than double Cape Horn or Good Hope; but
open the isthmian canal and that trade goes from us
never to return, because it can go all the way by i
short route in the "bottom" of a ship, and we may
suggest to Mr. Barrett that some of it will doubtless
j find room in the hold.
Assessor Dodge seems to be an expensive sort of
luxury. In his anxiety to fool the public into the
', belief that he was working for their interest he stuffed
the assessment roll of San Francisco with any old
thing until it reached this year a figure more than
four hundred millions. In consequence the tax
payers of the city have had to contribute to the Stite
treasury $700,000 more than they did last year. If
that is the teaching of the new school of assessment,
for heaven's sake give us the old.
A MASSACHUSETTS SNAP,
THE Democratic Governor General of Massa
chusetts, ruling under the sovereignty of Wil
liam the First, is Mr. George Frederick Wil
liams. The organization in which Gaston, William
E. Russell, Josiah Quincy, Charles S. Hamlin and
Sherman Hoar were the lights and leaders has now
shriveled down to the size of Mr. George Fred. Wil
liams' pocket and is carried there like a "luck penny."
Mr. Williams is charged with the duty of keeping
the party small and manageable and harmonious, and
has accomplished it by the expulsion of about 60.000
of its former members, and building a trocha barbed
with the aphorisms of Bryan around it.
He guards well his trust and proposes that his
suzerain from Nebraska shall receive the tribute de
manded, in. the form of a unanimous delegation to the
next National Convention.
In the fear that this may be in jeopardy he has se
cured the delegation in advance. Mr. David B. Hill
of New York was once unwise in his day and genera
tion and called in that State a "snap convention" to
get a national delegation opposed to Mr. Cleveland.
1 He got the delegation, but compared to its effect on
him the shirt of Nessus was a silk undergarment. The
shadow of the snap followed him like his doppel
i ganger, until he retired into a political hole, and it is
now believed pulled the hole in after him, for there
is no sign of him nor of the place where he disap
peared.
Unmindful of his fate, George Frederick, Governor
I General of the Massachusetts Democracy, has pro
j ceeded to elect in September, 1899, a delegation to the
I National Convention of 190 Q. As a snapper he ex
cels Hill, as greatly as does that fish, the red snapper,
excel a sucker.
At a recent conventicle of the Governors General
of the New Democracy, so new as to be "fresh," in
deed, he was warned that his snap in Massachusetts
might fire a gun heard around the Union â a sort of
an alarm gun that would start a reaction against the
present owners of the party. He was requested to
give a reason for his snap, and he frankly declared
that it was in order to get a Bryan delegation, which
might be doubtful in a State convention next year.
This admission is of great importance. It does not
imply that the 60,000 incomunicado Democrats of
.Massachusetts are going to become comunicado
with the party. But it means that there are signs of
fatigue among the starving concentrados who consti
tute Mr. Williams' forces. What he can compel them
to do now he fears he could not make them do next
year.
This Massachusetts symptom is not local; it is
general. There is a growing panic among the Bryan
forces. They are not in fear of invasion, but are ter
rified by the prospect of defection. Being anxious
I that Mr. Bryan shall continue to add to the gayety
] of nations by again playing an engagement as "The
imitation of a man running for President," we have
to propose that snap conventions be held in all the
States, in order to secure delegations that will pull
open the vocal throttle of the boy orator, aged 44, and
let his mind rest again while he talks.
In the eagerness to get food supplies to the people
of Porto Rico rendered destitute by the recent hurri
cane the Government officials of the War Department
chartered a foreign vessel as a transport, but when
the ship arrived the civil officers would not permit 1:
to unload because, being a foreign craft, it had no
right to carry goods from one American port to
another. It was a beautiful snarl for a while, but it
is all right now.
The Democratic donkey in Massachusetts made a
wild attempt to upset the apple-cart at the State con
vention on Thursday, but failed, and George Fred
Williams will drive in all right at the National Con
vention with the State delegation in his pocket Vir
i tually he has "got there" already.
THE ST. LOUIS RESOLUTIONS.
I â ', ROM the anti-trust conference at St. Louis the
public gets about what it expected â a set of
resolutions denouncing trusts in good set terms
and demanding "the enactment and enforcement by
the several States and the nation of legislation that
shall adequately and fully define as crimes any at
tempted monopolization or restraint of trade in any
line of industrial activity, with provisions for adequate
punishment, both of the individual or the corporation
| that shall be found guilty thereof, punishment to the
corporation to the extent of dissolution."
Among the acts of remedial legislation proposed are
a provision for publicity in corporate business, along I
| lines similar to those recommended by Bourke Cock
ran at Chicago, the subjection in every State of foreign
corporations to the same laws as are imposed upon
those incorporated within the State; the prevention of
one corporation from having another corporation as I
one of its constituent parts, or of owning or controlling j
the stock of another corporation engaged in the same |
or a competing business; the prevention of a corpora- j
tion from doing business in any State when it is a ,
member of a pool or a trust in another State, and the
1 requirement that all capital stock of private corpora
: tions must be fully paid up.
None of these suggestions are new and several of
them have been long under discussion. In particular
public sentiment has long been in favor of devising
some means of remedying the evil which has resulted
from permitting a corporation to obtain a charter in
one State for the purpose of evading the laws of the
State in which it purposes to do most of its business.
The Southern Pacific Company of Kentucky hr\s
made the people of California fairly familiar with the
gross abuses which can be made of that privilege of
our law, and of the importance of providing some
means of preventing them.
On that issue the conference adopted two declara
tions. One calls for the enactment by each State of
law? that will prevent the entrance of any foreign
created corporation into its limits for any other pur
pose than interstate commerce, except on terms that
will put the foreign-created corporation on a basis
of equality with the domestic-created corporation of
the State entered, and subject to the same laws, rules
and regulations of the State that it enters which are
applicable to the domestic corporations of that State.
The second calls for the enactment of legislation pro
, viding that a corporation created in one State to do
business exclusively in other States than when cre
ated shall be prohibited from admission into any State.
The second class of legislation demanded would be
a body blow at the Southern Pacific, for that company
is one of the corporations created by the State of
Kentucky with the provision that it shall not do busi
ness in Kentucky.
As the men who attended the conference are law
yers, it is fair to assume that the legislation they
recommend would be constitutional if properly drawn
up. It would therefore be worth while for the States
to put some of the less radical among them to the test.
An act preventing corporations from being organ
ized on fictitious capital, for example, might go far
toward checking the tendency toward fraud and undue
speculation which is now so notable in the East.
Such laws of course would not prevent trusts, but they
might correct some of the abuses which have grown
out of the corporation system of doing business.
Bourke Cockran's suggestion that the business of
trusts be made public is a most excellent one, but who
will audit the books, make up the statement, specify
for what purposes all sums were expended and make
oath that the figures don't lie?
Goldwin Smith, writing in a Canadian newspaper
with reference to the approaching celebration in
honor of Admiral Dewey, says Canada cannot pos
sibly take part. Well, hardly. Americans do not want
any Canuck? at the feast.
The warmth with which the Eastern press is com
mending Cornelius Vanderbilt as a philanthropist now
that he is dead has never been surpassed except by
that with which it denounced him as a plutocrat while
he was alive.
The French general staff gives evidence of improve

The American Society of Dancing Masters, accord

"How to hold your lady in the dance." The answer
seems obvious â don't introduce her to a handsomer

After having borne the brunt of the rhetoric of two
conferences, the trust problem stands just where it
did before and has the same aspect-

AUDITOR WELLS TO
ABIDE BY THE LAW
WILL ESTABLISH A TEACHERS'
SALARY FUND.
There is apparently some little trouble
ahead of the Finance Committee of the
Hoard of Education in the segregation
of its funds for the current fiscal year.
At its meeting on Thursday the commit
tee outlined its funds as follows:
Teachers' salaries J1.000.956
Office and shop salaries 22,658
Janitors' salaries 56,946
Rents b.ioo
es, not fixed
Auditor Wells, however, adheres to his
resolve to follow the law passed by the
last Legislature with regard to teai hers 1
.salaries. That law provides that the Su
peTvisors shall create a fund to be des
ignated teachers' salary fund, and shall
apportion to it an amount equal to the
sum expended for the purpose during the
previous year. The fund can be drawn
upon n>r no other use, arid if the Su
pervisors fail in their duty the Auditor
is authorized and directed to comply with
the law in their stead.
Last year there was paid out in teach
ers' salaries $850,463. Add to this the No
vember and December salaries which
were held up. amounting to SIT9,S4^, and
the fund which should be made this year
under the latest law is $1,029,799, which is
$28,813 more than the Finance Committee
intends using for that purpose.
Different members of the School Board
contend that the law of the last Legis
lature is unconstitutional, and A..
Wella is also inclined to that opinion, but
says that until the courts have passed
upon the question there is nothing f.>r
h;ni to do but obey the law as it stands.
The Finance Committee will meet with
the Auditor on Tuesday morning at 11
o'clock, and there Is little doubt that
some satisfactory arrangement will be ar
rived at between them.

meritorious service in which many of the j
men, both officers and file, have won >
honor at the cannon's mouth and blaz- \
oned their State banners with a record
which will last for all time. The Mon

Manila will never be forgotten.

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 23. 1899.
nles of the Montana regiment owe no
small token of recognition to the brave
and manful fellows, who have so glori
ously won the honors for them.
The regiment sailed from San Francisco
on the transport Pennsylvania June 20,
IS9S. They were assigned to General Mac-
Arthur's division, and with the Twentieth
Kansas, part of the Tenth Pennsylvania
and two batteries of the Third Artillery
acting as infantry made up the brigade
commanded by Brigadier General H. G.
Otis, which was stationed on the left of
the American line between Tondo and
Caloocan. Their active campaigning be
gan with the Filipino outbreak on the
night of February 4, and from that time
until some weeks after their last battle,
neur San Fernando June 16, one hundred
and forty-eight days, they were on con
tinuous duty at the front, marching,
righting and picketing, winning frequent
commendation in general order? and oftl
clal dispatches for their cheerful readi
nesa for any duty and their gallantry on
the Held. In this campaign of twenty
one weeks the regiment, which left here
with one thousand and thirty men, lost
by death on the -Â< or in the hospital
thirty-three men. with one hundred and
twenty-nine more or less severely wound
ed, a very large proportion of each being
commissioned and non-eommissfoned offi
cers. Their list of killed, as compared
with the wounded, and the few deaths
from wounds received In action, five in
all. speaks well for the hardy physical
make-up of the men and the efficient at
tention of their surgical staff.
The wing- of the Filipino army opposed
to the American left was commanded by
General Luna In person, and composed
of the best trained and beat equipped
troops In their service. Yet in not one
single instance were the Montana men
known to halt or ever falter after the
word was given to advance. Picked off
as they went by the well-covered enemy,
with his Mauser rifle and smokeless pow
der, yet the result was always the same.
Filipinos routed and the field won.
The story of their fighting In detail
would involve a history of the move
ments of Otis' brigade from the first
to the last of the campaign.
In the fighting before Caloocan and the
capture of that place on February 10, the
Montanas lost three killed and thirty
three wounded; and the operations be
tween Caloocan and Malabo n later In
that month added four more to the killed
and fifteen to the list of wounded.
On March 19 the rebrigading of the
troops took the Pennsylvanians from

TO SCULL FOR
CHAMPIONSHIP
Oarsmen Propose to Adopt
Longer, Lighter and
Faster Skiffs.
At the annual meeting of the Pacific
Association of the Amateur Athletic
Union held last Monday night in the
! Olympic clubrooms eight organizations
j were represented, six of which were row
' ing clubs. Sixteen delegates were pres
. ent, thirteen of them from boating or
' ganizations. Sixteen amateur clubs now
! belong to the association.
J. Ft. Bookman, president of the retiring
i board of managers, read a report, in
which he Skid that an attempt would be
made to revive Rugby and Association
football and to encourage relay races and
I water polo. The association now exercises
I jurisdiction over eighteen classes of sport,
I among which are billiards, boxing, indoor
and outdoor baseball, football and rowing.
The control which it exerts over most of
| these sports is nominal rather than real,
and it concerns itself almost entirely
with rowing, jurisdiction over which has
1 been expressly abandoned by its parent
body, the Amateur Athletic Union. It has
found itself unable, after repeated efforts,
to collect from the universities of Stan
; ford and California the fees lor sanctions
| for football games. A schedule of football
games has been arranged between the
, Olympic Club and the two universities,
and the Association officials threaten to
disqualify the players and stop the game*
.it the fees are not paid. P. J. Franklin,
! the only representative of the University
i of California present at the meeting, said
| that he believed the. university would pay
th fees if the matter were properly stated.
i No delegate being . ( in attendance from
Stanford, its intentions could not be as
certained.
Notice was given by S. J. Pembroke of
. 1 the Alameda Boat Club of an amendment
; to the by-laws whereby the length of the
outrigged skiff should be increased and its
beam narrowed, the proposed boat to have
a length of 23 or 24 feet, a minimum beam
of 16 inches, and a smooth bottom. The
i boats in use at present are 20". feet*. long,
2 Feet wide] ami' weigh about 70 pounds.
The South End delegate. J. P. Foley, says
! that a smooth-bottomed boat of the di
mensions proposed is Impracticable in the
rough waters -of the bay, and that a boat
â of this class is,, already in existence,,
' though it Is scarcely ever used, ' namely,
the wherry.
The South End; Rowing Club has a new
senior barge crew, in training. Its mem
bers are E. Scully, M. J. Breen, J. Pallas
and J. Lyons. The junior crew, consisting
of J. P. Foley,' A. Hampton, C. Bkelly and
C. c. Dennis, Is in regular training, and
will row in the new barge built- by Al
Rogers.
Th- Ariel Rowing Club will be well rep
resented in the championship regatta at
j El Campo on October 15. The senior barge
crew is made up of H. Wilson, bow: Wil
liam Howe, No. , 2; Robert Ellis, No. 3.
[ and James Wilson, stroke. The junior
: barge crew is made up of Charles Wilson,
stroke; E. C. Peters, No. 2, F. Loth, No.
3, and E. J. Lynch, stroke. All these â x
i cept Peters have had practice in barge
rowing, and all are six-footers; their ay
, erage weight is 170 pounds.
The Arlels will hold tryouts to decide
! ivho shall carry the club colors in the
: outrigged skiff race. ' The candidates are
: Ficken, Wilson and Haughton. Sternberg
and Kelley may form a junior barge crew,
; but otherwise will probably enter the jun
! ior skiff race. Three new members were
elected and five applications for member
ship were received at the last meeting of
the club. The order for a new skiff has
I been deferred until the association shall
j have settled on the dimensions of that
> class of boat.
The Alameda Boat Club will hold a re
gatta on Oakland Creek on October 1.
Atwell Webb, whose sister died recently,
has retired for the rest of the season
from the senior "barge crew. His place
will be taken by Eugene Hadcock. Chet
Ayers is stroking a junior barge crew, the
other members of which are E. T. Thorn
ing, C. Hague and Mr. Hainan.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL,, SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 23, 1899.
AWAIT THE BUGLE CALL TO THE POST.
THE sheen of silken jackets, the thunder of hoofs and the cheers of a multitude of spectators will usher In the O
winter racing season of 1*99-1900 at Oakland this afternoon. The officials of the California Jockey Club have g
left nothing undone which would insure the success of the meeting. The inaugural handicap at one mile will jj&
be the . d-bit of the programme. Charles Boots' buy horse, Hohenzollern. by Imp. Brutus-Brown Maria, Is fa- p
vored by many bettors for the big race. Galen Brown's horse Libertine, is also in demand. Â§&
STRIVING FOR
FIRST PLACE
Baseball Teams Are Eager
to Wrest Honors From
Sacramento.
Up to Sunday last it appeared the Sac
ramento ball tossers were running away
from all competitors in the race for the
championship trophy. The Santa Cruz
aggregation called a halt, and now It de
volves on the Oaklands to make the halt
a protracted affair. The Dudes are hot
on the trail of the leaders, and the local
fans, who have not yet lost all confidence
in Uncle Hank's team, are hoping that
Kwlng's men will shorten the gap be
tween first and uecond place. LÂ»ast week
the Oaklands saddened the heart of the
Frisco manager by preventing the Priscos
from gaining on the leaders. They are
playing no favorites, entertaining as they
do the hope that-they may soon be in tho
race themselves.
The Oaklands have beaten all comer*
since, thrtr reorganization, and It now
remains to be seen whether they can be
stopped- b> Sacramento. On formâ lf there
in any form in baseballâ the Dudes should
win easily. They won four from Santa
Cruz and made the fifth a draw, and thon
Santa Cruz won two straight from Sac
ramento. So a form prognostication
should pronounce the Oaklands the win
ners of the coming series.
The line-up for to-day is as follows:
Sacramento. Positions. Oakland.

be sent at once to Rulnart Stock Farm, of which R. Porter Ashe is president.
Tarcoola Is by Newminster out of Itnngtne. Newminster Is by Marqulfl Spa.

three lengths behind the bunch, which was led by Carriage, supposed to be the
greatest horse of the yenr. Tarooola made up the distance and ultimately won
by a head. The American record over an earthen track is S:3ff& He won the
Wllliarnstown cup, Queen's birthday handicap and ran third for the Caulfield

Special Disriat'-h to The Call.
NEW YORK, S^pt. 22.â G00d judgment
on the part of those in charge of the
yacht Shamrock to-day saved her from
what might have been a most serious ac

was towed to her moorings In the Horse

There the bobstay and Its fittings were
taken off and put on board the repair

owner, that the damage was trifling and
that the yacht would be all right In the

GUNMEN READY
FOR THE DUCKS
Await the Opening'of Shooting
Season With Pleasurable
Anticipation.
From the immense amount of powder
and shot sold during the past week it
would be advisable for ducks and quail
to avoid this district for the time being.
The shooting season â¢will open one week
from to-morrow and a veritfu^e army of
men will shoot over upland and marsh.
Brilliant sport Is not expected on the
opening day of the season, as "Veather
conditions have not been favorable for
some weeks past. Around Alvarado the
preserves are dry and offer no attractions
for ducks at present.
The officers of the Olympic Gun Club
have drawn a set of comprehensive rules
to co^ver all conditions of shooting on
their Cordelia preserves. The only days
shooting will be allowed are Sundays and
Wednesdays. There will be no shooting
before sunrise or after sunset. Shooters
will draw for blinds at Cordelia the
night before the shoot. No more than
twenty may shoot at one time; when
more than that number present them
selves lots shall be drawn. No loaded
guns will be permitted in the clubhouse
or at headquarters. Each shooter must
remove his own decoys from the ponds
when he is through for the day. The
following special rules of the club may
be read with profit by all gun men:
Study the comfort and pleasure of your
fellow-shooter, and conduct yourself bo as
not to Interfere with his sport. Remember
he is after ducks, too.
Refrain from loud talk and shouting: (to
your do* especially). Ducks don't have any
thing to do with noisy people. Stay in your
blind as much a.n possible, and stay out of
sight. Ducks won't decoy to you.
Shoot cripplesâ don't chase them.
Retriexe only as often as necessary â once
an hour Is enough.
Shoot only at birds within your reach.
Let skyscrapers aloneâ they "will come
nearer; If not to you to your fellow-shooter,
and he Is waiting for them patiently; don't
forget him.
Don't let your Run point at any one at
any timeâ shooters don't enjoy it, even
when jruns are not loaded.
Don't go into a house or a wagon with
your gun loaded.
Don't climb a fence with a load In your
pun. It takes but a minute to extract the
Shellsâ it takes three days for a funeral.
The members of the Shellville Rod and
Gun Club, whose headquarters are in
Sonoma County, are preparing for the
season. The following members met at
dinner recently and planned for the fu
ture: Harry Baum. Al Martin, Frank
Rumpf, Al Herzog, "Billy" Bay, M. Bur
gess, R. Reynaud, Herman Eisner. Bob
Johnson, George Hinde and George Bie
bershelmer.
otto Fendner has returned from his
annual vacation.
W. K. Quimby. a noted trap shot of the
Bast, Is expected here shortly.
Thomas Vincent and Frank Howiett
have returned after two weeks' shooting
and tlshing in Mendocino County. They
secured two bucks and trout in unlimited
numbers.
MAY FORM A NEW CLUB.
The announcement In The Call Thurs
day of the probable formation of a new
wheeling club, made up of the older
members of the Olympic Wheelmen and
Bay State Wheelmen, has been the sole
topic of conversation among the cyclers.
Many say they will join such an organiza
tion, though it must not be supposed that
they are by any means in the majority. .
Both clubs still have a large number of
warm supporters, who will stay by their
colors through thick and thin.
The idea of a new club, however, ap
peals strongly to those cyclers who take
little or no interest in racing. As one
rider "for health and pleasure" says: "I
am 30 years of age and of some slight
standing in the community. I drop down
to my club of an evening and no one
notices my entry or exit. A few moments i
later in comes an 18-year-old boy, who
has achieved fame as a racer, and behold
every attention is shown him. â¢ Special i
quarters are fitted up for the racers in
the Bay City Club occupying the entire
basement of the building, while a man
who wants to read has to sit in the back
parlor and card players are relegated to i
a table in the front parlor. What kind
of whist can a man play with a piano,
miserably played, thumping in his ears?'
With the Olympics, the sole cause of de
fection is the proposed increase in dues,
which â will bring the dues of the wheeling
annex up. to $,"> 25. a month; too much, say
the riders, for a cycler to have to pay for
club dues. They think a club with about
150 members can be supported for about
half .that amount monthly.
'â  Charles Albert Adams of the Olympics
is a hearty supporter of the new move
ment and declares that he knows of at
least fifty men who will sign the charter
roll of the new club.
Now that the date of the annual
twenty-mile road race has been definitely
set at October 8, the riders of the three
clubs who will enter teams have again
gone into .active training for the event
The Bay Citys, Olympics and Garden
Citys will enter teams. The Acmes may
but have said they would not.
James Joyce Jr., well known to the
wheelmen here, is located in New York
associated with Harry Payne Whitney in
the automobile business. They control
the entire electric cab business of New
York.
The first meeting of the new board of
directors of the Bay City Wheelmen was
held Thursday evening and the following
officers were elected: President. Archie
Reid; vice president, F. C. Boeckman
treasurer, Austin Kanzee;. recording sec
retary, S. B. Vincent: captain, Frank N

CHALLENGER GADDER
AND THE TRUANT
READY TO RACE
THE fourth race for the San Fran
cisco challenge cup will take place
to-day over the Corinthian course
of thirteen nautical miles between
the sloop Gadder, representing the
San Francisco Yacht Club, and the sloop
Truant, representing the Corinthian
Yacht Club. The Corinthians are the
holders of the trophy, and the San Fran
ciscos the challengers. The Gadder will
be sailed by ex-Commodore \V. N. Me- !
Carthy, owner of the schooner Ramona. j
The crew will consist of J. R. Savory of j
the Juanita, R, S. Bridgeman of the The
tis, J. S. Cockerill (who has been sailing
this season with Commodore T. L. Hill oif
the flagship Cygnus) and Mr. Welch. Ex-
Commodore A. J. Young will be the rep
resentative of the Corinthians on the
Gadder. The Truant will be sailed by her
owner, ex-Commodore J. W. Pew. whose
crew will be Orlo Eastwood, Charles L.
Barrett. Commodore Carl Westerfeld, J.
Short and F. E. Schober. The represent
ative of the San Francisco Club on board
the Truant will be Secretary E. C. Bart- I
lett. The referee Is Commodore J. S.
Hanley of the Encinal Yacht Club. The
members of the regatta committees of the
two clubs will act as judges. The timers
are J. H. Hopps and G. D. Campbell. The
officials and invited guests will follow the
race on the steamer Caroline, which will
be at Melggs wharf at the foot of Powell
street at 12:30 p. m. The yachts will start
at 1 p. m., and will have ten minutes utter
the signal gun within which to cross the
line The sailing rules of the Corinthian
as the challenged club will govern the
race.
Th e Truant was on Frank Stone's ways
at liburon last Saturday, getting the
damage done to her on Admission day re
paired and being put into thorough order.
The Gadder came down from Benicia to
Sausalito last Sunday, was taken up on
the club ways on Thursday and came off
again yesterday. She draws less than a
foot of water and has a somewhat ugly
boxlike appearance. To give her stability

FOOTBALL MEN
ROUNDING OUT
Stanford, California and Olym
pic Working for the
Season's Games.
Whirr goes the pigskin through the air,
and loud is the shouting- of the coaches as
they yell football wisdom into the ears of
the college colts. Both at Palo Alto and
at Berkeley the afternoon is given over
to the pigskin, game, and the work has
begun in earnest. On this side of the bay \
the Olympic Club is struggling with a i
team that will make itself felt in the i
series of games with the college elevens, 1
as the men are not neglecting a moment j
of their daily practice. â¢_
The preliminary work has not yet been
completed at either of the colleges, but
Californa will begin active training before
Stanford for two reasonsâ they were ear- !
lier on the field and the team is in a better ;
state of formation than that at Palo Alto. I
The Olympic Club eleven began work
some two weeks ago and ignored what is '
usually known as preliminary work. As I
the winged "O" gridiron athletes are men !
or ; seasoned â¢ brawn and ripened experi- i
ence they do not need preliminary work ,
Other than that which acts as a condition- j
ing element. â  . .-, â¢
The Olympic team of this year is per- I
haps the best as far as material goes I
which that club ever presented. There is
not a man on the line who is not a heavy,
trained football athlete and who has not
played the position which he will occupy I
less than three years. Signal practice of
the rapid order, .execution of plays and
tackling make up the practice of the club
athletes. They have no team to line up j
against, and so they are trying to perfect i
team work by exercise in signal practice !
As all the men are old players, and able
I ones at that, this is not such a serious '
\ situation as at first seems. Later on in I
the season, when the college men have
reached the stage of training where they
can stand any kind of a battle, the Olym
pics may find themselves in a bad way
unless they engage in just such kind of
practice work. The Saturday games will
tend, to round out the Olympics. Last <
I season the clubmen were battered into
condition after two months of play, but!
the season was over and they could not i
redeem themselves.
The Olympic team is practically chosen
During the -early- part of this week the
already strong aggregation of players was i
fortified by the addition of Cadwallader, :
ie , ale ': cnter of 1597 - Big -Cad," for he !
I weighs 225 pounds and is as active as a I
small man, strengthens the Olympic line
in.no mean fashion. He .will not play
center, however. . Hobbs is , chosen for
that position, "Pete" Smith playing left
guard and Cadwallader right guard For
tackles the. Olympics will play "Gene" I
; Sheehy on the right side of the line and
' La vender Erskin on the left side. The i
| ends are as yet uncertain. The selection !
, will be between McLaine, Gaylord and
I Dlnsmore. three good men of about equal
1 ab L li T\V,, Code at Quarter and Thierkauf i
i and AVi son playing halves and Carter at
! full will make a team which, if properly '
i trained, ought to carry everything be
| fore it. tor substitutes the Olympics i
; have Clum, Hamilton, Atkinson and Man
! roe, the latter being a powerful linesman.
j He will possibly alternate with one of the
guards or tackles in the Saturday games j
It is almost possible to judge of the I
weights of the teams this season by the
material which is offered the coaches for
selection. The Olympics will have the
heaviest eleven by, big odds. Then will
come Stanford,. whose eleven will far out
weigh that of Berkeley. Stanford will
play Burnett as suard and one of the Gil
mans â at â¢ center. . At least it looks as if
that selection would be made. Another
guard, Christie, who is a tremendously
large man. will help to form a center of
ultra heavyweights that will give Cali
fornia cause for worry. At Palo Alto the
work of sifting is still going on. Reid,
the famous Harvard back, was out coach
ing the Cardinal backs last week, while
Chamberlin- was devoting his time to the
linesmen. Coehian is finding no easy Job
with his colts at California. The material
is about the ( same as last year and there
is. still the lack of heavy men for the Blue
and Gold team.
.The first game of the season will be
played a week from to-day, on the Berke
ley campus, between . the Olympics and
California. Coehran says he does not ex
pect to win the game, but the Olympics,
he asserts, will know that they have been
.Diayiws loytball before ganag la over.
vas a weighted fin keel haÃ been added to
her. She is said to be very stiff in a strong
breeze. When the challenge was first is
sued it was supposed the San Franciscos
had in view the fact that at the end of
September the wind has lost some of Its
summer force and that light weather
would be most favorable to the challenger.
Now, however, the San Franciscos seem,
to rest their main hope on the chance
of a strong wind. The Corinthians also
believe that a stiff breeze will suit their
! defender best, so a light breeze will sat
i Isfy neither. The San Franciscos. wheth
; er they win or lose, will give a hop in the
clubhouse at Sausalito to-night and will
j cruise over the channel course to-mor
row.
The Corinthian yachtsmen feel that an
injustice has been done to them and to
ex-Commodore J. W. Pew by the charges
of "unsportsmanlike conduct" which have
I been made against them. The terms un
der which the challenge cup is teld state
that the defending yacht must not have
a racing length more than 10 per cent
greater than that of the challenger. When
the San Franciscos named 25.50 feet as the
racing length of their boat the Corinth
ians were entitled to select a defender not
exceeding 28.05 feet racing length. On
looking around among the thirty-footers
(the strongest class in the club) the Tru
ant seemed the best boat and she was
accordingly chosen. There was nothing
in the slightest degree "unsportsman
like" in this. The Corinthians merely
selected the best defender the rules per
mitted them to choose. It is said that the
San Franciscos wished to challenge in
the 25-foot class and had no intention of
racing against one of the Corinthian 30
--footers. If they wished to make sure of
this the extreme racing length of the
challenger should have been 22.73 feet.
Corinthians say that as a matter of fact
they have to defend the cup with a cruis
ing boat against a racing machine, which
has had a house put on in order to con
form to the rules and make it a cabin
yacht. So long as the rules are complied
with this is permissible.
The yachts of the California Club under
orders of Commodore Allen M. Clay will
rendezvous at Sand Cove. Angel Island,
this evening. To-morrow the members will
enjoy a clambake on the beach.

Next Saturday there will be a tourna
ment for the Tibbets cup, presented by
Mrs. Le Grand Cannon Tibbets.
Several of the caddies on the Oakland
links are manifesting great interest in
golf and are developing considerable skill.
With the unconsciousness of youth they
imitate the style of J. Melville, formerly
professional of the Oakland Club and
one of the best golfers in the United
States.
There will be mixed foursomes, nine
holes with handicap, on the links of the
San Rafael Golf Club to-day, and an ap
proach putting contest for men and wo
men. In the handicap twenty entries had
been received on Thursday, and thirty
for the approach putting contest. In the
latter contest each competitor plays five

TRANSPORTS TO
LEAVE WITHOUT
BOILER REPAIRS
They Will Have Work
Done Elsewhere.
The boilennakers held a largely attend- >
cd meeting yesterday afternoon In their
hall on the corner of Second and Pol
som. â¢ It was at first stated that a gen
eral strike had been ordered; that all the
men had left' the Risdon and Fulton iron
works, while those engaged on various
Jobs along the front had been called out.
There was no foundation for the rumor,
however, as all that was required was
the attendance of every boilermaker In
the. union. The conference lasted over
. two hours and then a committee was
pent out to inform the managers of the
various Iron works that there would be
no change in mercantile marine work.
The men agree to work nine hours for
ten hours' pay on outside work and for
the usual Fcale on shop work.
On transports, however, or on vessels
that come here under charter to the Gov
ernment the scale will be eight hours'
work for ten hours*, pay and twenty-six
hours'* pay * or eleven hours' overtime.
In consequence there are no boilermak
ers working on any of the transports,
nor will there be until the strike or lock
out is settled.
The rirst fruit of the trouble came to
light yesterday. The steamer Manuense
is here, ready for acceptance by the Gov
ernment as a transport. She was in
spected yesterday and it was found neces
sary to do considerable work on her boil
ers. Owing to the existing state of af
fairs no one will take the contract to do

THE SAN FBANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 23, 1899.
PARKER'S HEIRS
DECIDE UPON A
COMPROMISE
Lawyers About Reach
an Agreement.
THEY CONFERRED YESTERDAY
INSTITUTIONS WILL RECEIVE
SOLID HELP.
Five Thousand Dollars Each to Go to
Unitarian Church. Sheltering Arms
Society and Home of Benevo
lence in San Jose.
The long litigation over the estate of
j George H. Parker is about to end. The
attorneys representing the 6everaJ inter
j ests are agreed that it Is -well to com
j promise. Yesterday afternoon & con
: ference was held in the office of D. M,
; Delmas and the matter was talked over
j thoroughly. The terms of the compro
; mise to be effected were not completed,
I but no doubt was expressed that a comÂ«.
| promise will be reached very soon. It
; may come at any time. The attorneys
j present were: D. M. Delmas, representing
the executors and the residuary legatees,
and Van R. Paterson and T. C. Coogan,
> representing the widow of Edward L.
; Parker, the only son of George H. Parker.
None of the attorneys would speak of
I the terms upon which the compromise
| was under discussion until the matter
; was finally concluded. The proposition
for the compromise came from the at
, torneys for the widow of Edward L.
Parker.
â  Outside of the interest that was
i awakened by the nature of the proceed
ings ami the prominence of George H.
Parker the public at large has been con
' cerned by the legacies of a semi-public
nature to well-known institutions pro
vided for in the will. The bulk of the
estate was to go to the only son. Edward
, L. Parker, but not until after the death
I of the son's wife, Emma. While she lived
: the son was to have only 110,000 outright
and the income from the property at 1122
; and 1124 Market street and 19 Turk street,
j this city. But in the event of the death
j of the wife the son, if he survived, was
to have the properties outright and all
the estate not otherwise disposed of in
legacies. In the discrimination against
the son's wife the father showed the bit
terness of his opposition to her. This bit
terness has been shared by the relatives
; by marriage of George H. Parker and the â¢:
j result has been a series of charges against j
| the wife, the airing of which did much I
to [eve the monotony of the routine
proceedings.
The legacies included the following:
First Unitarian Church of San' Jose, I300O;
Sheltering Arms Society of San Jose. $5000;
i trustees of the Home of Benevolence of
San Jose. $5000: to the five children of
Marshal] Pomeroy of Santa Clara County,
i $5000 each: Mr.-, F. O. Barto of San Fran
cisco, Jl'Wt; Mrs. Dr. Sage of San Fran-
Cisco, >. â â¢, Augusta Butler of San Jose,
$1000; G. M. Wooster of San Jose, $10<JO.
The sum of $1000 was bequeathed also to
each of the following named persons in !
the East: Lizzie Sykes. Henrietta Sykes |
: and Myra Allen, all of Connecticut.
There appears to be no doubt that the '
institutions in Santa Clara County will
get the sums given to them in the will.
. The other matters are still in doubt. The
total value of the estate was originally .
$250,000, but the expenses of the long liti- i
gation and the attorney fees have made a j
large hole in the original sum.
George H: Parker die.l in Santa Clara
County in March, 1883. A few weeks after
his will, with two codicils, was duly ad
mitted to- probate. Within a year the
widow of Parker's only son filed a contest ,
of the probate on three. grounds, namely â
fraud, undue influence and unsoundness of â¢
mind. â  Upon the challenge of these
grounds by the parties interested under
the will the issues were tried before a jury
in Santa Clara County. After the contest
ant's case had closed the court withdrew I
i the consideration of the issues of fraud
! and undue influence, on the ground that
i there was no evidence to support them.
Upon the only remaining issue, of un- :
soundness of mind, the jury found against
the will. This was at the second trial, a :
jury having disagreed upon the first hear
ing. The widow having won so far, an
| appeal was taken to the Supreme Court, i
and there the case has been for some
! time. The litigation in its varied forms
has extended over a period of six years.
Parker was over 76 when he died, but he
I continued to do business to the end. Three j
women testified that they considered him I
insane and alleged, among other things, .
that he loaned money without security: '
that, although a mild man generally, he
would go Into a rage suddenly over a
trifle; that he on one occasion set fire to
his home by throwing a piece of paper
: into the chimney to burn it out. rather
I than pay the cost of having it cleaned:
and that he paid money that he did not
owe. The Pomeroya and Parker were re- .
lated by the marriage of George H. ,
Parker to Noah Pomeroy's sister.
In court the allegation was also made ;
1 that Emma L. Parker, the widow of Ed
ward L. Parker, formerly Emma L. Huff.
falsely represented to Edward L. Parker
| that she was the widow of George L. j
Brown and that Brown died at the Occi- ;
dental Hotel and that she was possessed
' of his great wealth. The marriage took
place in the East.
THE KENNEDY MURDER.
"Warren Main, bartender in the saloon
at 2"2 Third* street, who shot and killed
William Kennedy in the saloon Thursday
afternoon, was instructed and arraigned
in Judge Graham's court yesterday on
the charge of murder. The case was con
: tinued tiil next Wednesday, pending the
result of the Coroner's inquest.
The police are still working on the case,
but nothing has developed to show that
i the shooting was anything but the re-
I sult of persona] differences. Main claims
I that the cause of Kennedy's animosity
toward him was because he found him
going through a customer In the saloon
I and called him down for it.

Folsom streets.
been laid on many of the principal
streets. The association does not con
sider that its mission is more than be- j
gun, for yesterday its directors met j
and laid out the following programme
of improvements to be advocated and
accomplished during the ensuing year:
Civil Serviceâ The successful opera
tion nf our future city government
depends largely upon the just enforce
ment of the provisions of article XIII
upon civil service in the new charter.
These provisions should be faithfully
executed. The Mayor will bo asked to
appoint aa civil service commissioners
only public-spirited citizens of the
highest character, who are known to
be sincerely devoted to civil service
principles, and who will carry out the
civil service provisions of the n*w
charter In a fair and Impartial man
ner.
Sewer Systemâ The plan for a com
plete and permanent new sewer sys
tem, now being prepared by the pres
ent sewer commission, should be com
pleted and the necessary provisions .
should he made for immediately pro
eeding with tho construction of mod
i .p. main sewers and sewer outlets and
the reconstruction of such other por
tions of the system as the sewer .com
mission' may deem imperatively neces
sary
Public Buildingsâ The following new
public building? should be construct
ed at the earliest possible period: City
and County Hospital, Hospital for
Contagious Diseases, public school
buildings where necessary, Fire De
partment buildings and equipments in
such outside districts as are without
fire protection.
Placing of Wires Undergroundsâ The
present ordinance for removal of poles
and placing underground electric wires
within the prescribed district should
be strictly enforced.
Street Cleaningâ The present system
of street cleaning should be main
tained and improved.
Street lightingâ The present sys
tem of street lighting should be im
proved and extended through the out
lying districts.
Street Sprinklingâ The business
s:;-' eta in all portions of the city
should be systematically sprinkled by
the city.
Improved Street Pavementsâ All
the cobble pavements on business
streets should be replaced with mod
ern pavements within two years and a
systematic plan be pursued for im
proving other pavements in bad con
dition as rapidly as the funds will
permit
Improved Specificationsâ The speci
fications for paving should .be
improved and so framed as to admit
of asphalt, vitrified brick, wooden
blocks and any other desirable ma
terials in addition to the paving ma
terials used at present, and all specifi
cations should require that guarantees
shall be given for the maintenance of
the pavements for a period of not leas
than ten years.
Use of Salt Waterâ Plans should
be prepared and proceedings In
stituted for the construction and ac
quisition at an early date of a salt
water pumping plant and reservoirs
for supplying salt water for flushing
sewers, sprinkling streets and other
purposes where practicable.
Public Comfort Stationsâ These con
veniences shoud be established whera
m.>st necessary in the business dis
tricts throughout the city.
Expenditures for Improvements
in the Tax Levyâ As the maxi
mum amount which may be raised
by the tax levy under the charter will
not all be required for the administra
tion of the city government, if said
government is conducted in an econo
mical manner, we favor expending the
surplus in permanent improvements,
which Improvements should be speci
fically provided for each year In the
annual tax levy. The funds so set
aside for improvements should not be
diverted "r used for any other purpose.
Bonds for Improvements-^ c favor
submitting to the voters the ques
tion of issuing bonds for such im
provements as are necessary or desir
able at the present time but which
cannot be provided for by the annual
tax levy under the charter dollar limit.

The market here was very nils tn-day pending
the Cabinet decision. President Steyn's speech |
broke â¢ the Africans end other markets were '
sympathetically affected. Americans o^iiif.d
dull below parities, but Berlin bought no North
ern Pacific on the dividend statement. Others
were neglected until the afternoon, when New
York bought Southern Pacific and Central Pa
cific, causing a rally, the closing being at the
best. In the street Louisville and Nashville
and Southern Railway . were weak on yellow
fever reports, but rallied. Tintos, 46%. New
York bought Anacondas on the dividend. It
was li^-fimi.
In gold Â£325,000 wae taken for the Cape and
Â£19,000 In bars and French coin was bought.
The prices relapsed a farthing to 77s 9d in the
absence of American demand. It is alleged now
that the Â£100.000 recently taken was for the
Continent and not for New York. Money was
unchanged. The bank did a fair business In

Bradstreet's Financial Review.
I Â« *,
NEW YORK, Sept. ,22.â Bradstreet's Finan
cial Review to-morrow will say:
I Money continues firm, though toward .the
i close of the week there was a relaxation 'of the
pressure which the stock market has expected
during the past fortnight from this cause. The
decline of exchange rates and the news that
! about $500,000 of gold had been engaged in Lon
don for shipment to New York caused a some
what better feeling as to the financial outlook,
and the market rallied more or less from Its
earlier depression. The threatening aspect of
the Transvaal situation was among the bear
' ish factors of the week, and it id thought that
while the danger of war in South Africa over
hangs the London maiket there is little like
lihood of any heavy gold Imports from the
Other side. The movement of money from New
York to the interior continues, and the bank
statement of ' last Saturday practically wiped
out the surplus reserve. Yet the money mar
ket this" week, while firm, was not stringent,
and though the call loan rate was firm at
about 6 per cent, extreme variations from that
i level were less marked.
I The pressure to liquidate speculative hold-
Ings of stocks has at times been severe, the
most significant illustrations of this having
â  been afforded by the course of Brooklyn Rapid
' Transit and the other Flower stocks In the
I early part of the week. The decline In prices
I and the reduction of the- volume of loans to
AVall street has naturally been a factor In as- |
sisting the monetary situation. ' It also seems
: that stocks have been largely passing from
! weak Into strong hands, while the movement of
the past fortnight has made bears of the pro
fessionals and resulted In the creation of a
larger short Interest than the market has pos
sessed for some time. The activity of the bears
was naturally a feature of the week, and to
1 manipulation of this kind some of the extreme
1 declines may be ascribed. The covering of
shorts on a large scale also contributed largely
! to the rallying tendency in price which began
on Wednesday and assumed considerable force
â In Thursday's transactions. The public was by
no mentis active except In reducing Its mar
ginal holdings of stocks, and the market has
been largely In the hands of professional oper
ators.
Europe** part In the speculation here .was
! negative, and while London Is In suspense
about the South African situation, no Interest
In American securities Is â¢possible. The favora
ble character of railroad earnings, the activity
I of trade and the other evidences of prosperity
I continue to cause a strong underlying bullish
sentiment as to the future of the market. In
i fact, the street Itself Inclines to a belief that
I should t!i.> condition of the money market Im
prove, a renewal of the rising â  speculation
would be very probable. Nor his the market
j been without bullish developments this week.
I The rapid advance of Delaware, Lackawanna
j & Western stock to 191 and the strength of the
other anthracite coal properties seem to re
flect a general belief that the position of the
coal trade has undertone a material Improve
ment, while In the case of Lackawanna there
are rumors of some pending developments re
garding Its capital' and dividends which would
Justify the advance. Nor are railroad deals ack-
Ing, the most Important happening of that kind
being the reported sale of large Interests In the
Southern Pacific to bankers Identified with the
property.

Bradstrect's on Trade.
I . I
NEW YORK, Sept. 22.â Bradstreefa to-mor
row will say:
Satisfactory trade and price conditions ap
j parc-ntly still relfcn. So few. In fact, are the
| reports of poor trade that favorable reports
may he said to be almost unanimous. An ex
panded volume of fall trade Is Indicated by the
HKKreKate of hank clearing for the week,
though reports from some markets point to the
Kreatest rush bcinK made. Prices, as a rule,
maintain all their former strength, decreases
being few and relatively unimportant. In Â»v J
ernl lines, notably cereals, cotton. petroleum.
Iron and steel, the tendency Js . ** oa*}SJÂ£:0 a *}SJÂ£: I
ward higher levels. Cotton haa been notably j
strong and active. Short crop 811 â¢* 1 "^
becoming more generally current, and bearish
| estimates of maximum yields have been prac
tically discarded, more especially as Â« is
claimed that agents of English spinners are
heavy buyers at the South, and domestic man
ufacturing conditions are known to be in a
high degree favorable. . Â«,,â,._ .â !
Steady demand for export and confidence in ,
all of the year's crop being needed ha\e
proved stimulating in the face of heavy re
celpts and admittedly large present supplies.
Possibility of war in the Transvaal, too has
been an additionally strengthening feature.
Iron and steel are higher on a moderate volume
of new business, and the steady placing of or
ders Indicates confidence in present values well
on Into the middle of next year. Pig Iron, how
ever. is nearer a parity with consumption, me
ultimate 'effect of enhanced quotations upon
demand is not yet settled, and imports from
abroad, while not likely to be of heavy volume ,
immediately, are a feature which may have |
to be dealt with next year. The scarcity of j
beef cattle Is reflected in still higher prices,
arid strength Ik shown in domestic hides, which â 
also feel the impetus of steady demand from I
manufacturers of leather. No signs of abate
ment in the sugar war are to be seen, price
cutting Is active and prices are demoralized.
Other groceries, however, are firm, as are most
other lines, with the exception of cheese and
i tin, which note some easing in price from the
recent advance.
Most lines of manufacturing return strikingly :
good reports, notable In this respect being cot- !
ton and â  woolen goods. Complaints of back- â 
ward deliveries of cotton goods are common,
while In woolen goods a number of mills re
port their order-books filled for spring delivery ,
and have withdrawn from the wool market.
Wool is higher at London and sympathetically
strong here, and expectation of a good export
trade for fine grades of domestic Is enter
tained. The coal trade reflects weather and
trade conditions and still further Improved de
mand, and predictions are of further advances
later in the season. Demand for lumber, i
though Interfered with by strikes at a number
of markets; is reported very strong, and scar
city of cars and boats is reported quite general-
Ily In the West. This scarcity of transporta
tion, however, is not limited to the lumber
trade, similar reports coming from the coal
and Iron industries.
Wheat, Including flour, shipments for the
week aggregate 4,630.765 bushels, against 4.536.- i
552 bushels last week, 5.224.927 bushels. In the
corresponding week of 1898, 6,708,825 bushels in ;
1897, 3,930.455 bushels in 1896 and 3,151,097 bush- |
els In 1595. Since July 1. this season, exports i
of wheat aggregate 46.643.450 bushels, against ;
41,694,018 bushels last year and 50,310,525 bush- |
els In 1597-BS.
Business failures for the -week are 147. as
compared with 149 last week, 182 in this week a '
year ago, 237 In 1897. 321 In 1856 and 198 in 1595
In the United States.
Business failures for the week in the Domin
ion of Canada number 13, as against 24 last
week. 19 in this week a year ago, 35 in 1597, 34 ,
In 1596 and 35 In 1895.

Dun's Reviezv of Trade.
â¦ Â»
NEW YORK, Sept. 22.â G. Dun & Co.'s
weekly review of trade will say to-morrow:
The reaction in the stock market Is not a
sign of anything outside of the market, but
has set many to look for signs of a reaction
elsewhere. Such signs have been hard to find.
It has been for months a wonder that the de
mand for products' was sustained at rates ex
ceeding past consumption In any year, not
withstanding the general rise In prices. But
the demand does not appear to abate, and the
rise In prices continues. A partial explanation
Is that scarcely any class of products directly
consumed by Individuals has advanced as much
'as the wages and employment of labor. With
: more hands at work more hours and with 10 to
15 per cent higher wages, the gain in purchas
ing power has been quite beyond the rise of 4
per cent in boots and shoes this year, or 8 per
cent in leather. 5.2 per cent in woolen goods,
or 10.9 per cent in wool, and even beyond the
I rise of 17 per cent in cotton goods, mainly due
;to the rise of 13 per cent in cotton. Rut pro
ducts used In manufacturing and transporting
have advanced much more, because of the enor
mous Increase In volume of business done and
in anticipated business for the future. Higher
prices cause shrinking demand, other things
being equal, but this year other things are not
equal.
Wheat export? fall a little below last year's,
but in three weeks, flour included, have been
5.656,877 bushels from Atlantic ports against
j 9,293,381 bushels last year and 1,021,998 bushels
from Pacific ports against 907,961 bushels last
j year. But Western receipts have been 21,759,
--! 852 bushels against 23,099,397 bushels last year,
and even more Impressive are the receipts .'of
18,515,932 bushels of corn against 11,177,483 bush
els last year, and the exports of 9.201,427 bush
els against 5. 943. :Â»'â ''. last year. Prices moved
little either way until Friday, when a sharp
advance made the week's gain He. Further
Government reports have been so far accred
ited abroad that cotton has risen to 6.62 c, but
it come? forward more freely than in years of
maximum crops.
When men pay $3 and Jo per ton more than
the latest quoted price for Iron products in or
der to get early deliveries, It is because delay
is threatened on works or railroads or bridges,
vessels or machinery, promising a net profit
many times the cost of a small fraction of the
material. In such circumstances, as in much
of the reconstruction and expansion now going
on, present cost counts for little compared with
the earning power of the finished product in a
time like this. Bessemer and anthracite pig
I are unchanged, grey iorge at Pittsburg and
Chicago and Southern iron are higher, bars $.'
per ton higher and plates $3 per ton and rails
:Jl per ton. Most of the business is for next
; year, with premiums paid for more speedy de-
I livery.
Negotiations for consolidation of Fall River
cotton mills have developed a contest between
those favoring local or non-local management,
with a new selling arrangement announced for
other plain goods as well as for print-cloths.
Prices of prints have been cut one-quarter cent
for Indigo blues, but otherwise the demand is
strong. The American Wool Company has an
nounced that the whole production of all Its
worsted mills has been sold, which may give
unexpected opportunities for other mills. Its
| contracts for a great quantity of machinery in
j dicate a belief that within its field the demand
( for goods will much exceed the capacity of its
â  works. Prices have been firm, with wool
! stronger. since the general advance at London.
; Sales at the three chief markets were 13,443,800
pounds.
Failures for the week have been 154 In the
United States, against 173 last year, And in
Canada IS, against 16 last year.

. CHICAGO, Sept. 22.â Wheat opened firm at a
shade over yesterday's closing price for De
cember, and .though there were periods of re
action, the general tendency of the market was
upward to 'the close. . At 'the' start 'business
was rather slow, but with buyers In the ma-
Jorltv. Liverpool was up *,@%d, partly on
the good spot demand at that market and
partly on the critical state of affairs in the
Transvaal. Primary receipts were Urge, but
clearances were also heavy, and early in me
session a good export business was Indicated.
The main feature of the strength, however,
was the elimination of the heavy selling pres
sure recently put on the market by the nrm
whose suspension was announced yesterday.
Barrett & Farnum. A good deal of inherent
strength was suggested by the great amount
of wheat the market had absorbed from that
source without any material, decline, and It
impressed speculators to a considerable degree.
Good buying was done by the local crowd but
outside support was also prominent, St. L/OUis
being a buyer. The strength shown by the
coarse grains also made its influence felt on
wheat later in the session. Trading gradually
broadened and during the afternoon was quite
active, with prices steadily advancing. The
market" got considerably over" call price and
there was a good deal of selling against those
privileges, but everything offered was readily
absorbed. One of the. largest. export, houses in
New York reported more general acceptances
of offers of "wheat to foreign points than ut
any time since the Lelter deal. That many of
fers were still somewhat under the market was
shown by export engagements of but thirty
loads. Most of the statistical news was bear
ish, but It had little effect on the market. De
cember opened at 71 T *'fiT2c, sold at 71 ! 1 71% c,
advanced steadib- to 73c and closed firm and
l<Sl%c higher at 72%@73c. Almost nothing
was done in. September. Offerings were light
and but few bids were necessary to advance
the price 2c. It closed at 74c. .
There was a big speculative trade In corn.
Brokers were all well supplied with buying
orders and prices advanced sharply, with De
cember in the lead. The cash demand was
, large, with foreigners accepting liberally for
shipment of the new crop. ' December closed
?ic higher. . . .
Oats followed the lead of other grains and
was strong all day. December closed %c up. â 
Provisions were rather. dull, but steady. The
market was helped by the strength of the grain
markets and a sharp advance In meat' prices
abroad, and prices averaged a. little higher.
At the close January pork was 7%c higher, lard
2%c and ribs a shade higher.

WHEATâ The market was stiff and active,
and futures, advanced materially. There was
a good demand for shipment.
Chicago was strong at an advance. The in
terior movement' in the Northwest decreased
and offerings were light everywhere. Broom
hall cabled a good' spot demand at Liverpool,
with Argentine shipments of 1,500.000 bushels;
also that the Transvaal situation was serious
and that locusts were threatening the northern
part of the Argentine, - though the prospects
there were considered good. All markets
looked as If they would do better. There was
an urgent demand for cash Corn.

Harrison's circular says: "During the week
there have been three arrivals of coal from
Washington, with 7576 tons: three from British
Columbia. 10,686; three from Oregon, 1650: one
from Baltimore. 2265; total. 22.177 tons. No car
goes of English or Australian are at hand, al
though there are five vessels fully due. The
scarcity of fuel for domestic uses is very ap
parent, as over 100 coal carts are In a line
awaiting their turns to get Wellington out of
a steamer just arrived. There are several
steamers due this month that have been en
gaged 'under time charters to transport coals
to San Francisco. When these commence their
deliveries our supplies will be materially aup- â¢
mented. The drafts made on our steamers by
the Government have seriously congested our
transportation facilities, as that service 13
much more remunerative than carrying coal.
This has caused an advance In freights from
Washington and British Columbia, which ad
vance is being added to the price and will be
felt later on by our large consumers of steam,
fuel.
"This may force some of our manufactories
1 to utilize oil, which should prove more eco-
I nomical In some cases. The demand for Hono
lulu is active. Shipowners are demanding $6
per ton freight on coal from Newcastle, N. S.
W.. for early loading, and even at that figure
but little tonnage is procurable."

ASSIGNED TO THE
TRANSPORT GRANT
She Will Sail Next
Monday.
The Thirtieth Infantry will be the next
to get away, but it will he followed
closely- by the Twenty-sixth, which has
been ordered to take the place of the
Thirty-first on the transport Grant. The
Thirtieth will sail to-day on the Sherman.
It was at first thought that the regiment
would be trans! to the Grant, but
Instead the Twenty-sixth has been moved
up on the list of those to go away and
it will take the Grant and leave for the
islands Monday next. The Twenty-sixth
has not been more than a week in camp.
It has had a good deal of target practice
and a great many of its men are veterans,
so it does not need so long a probationary
period as some of the regiments which
have come from the East.
There has been no change In the situ
ation at the smallpox camp In the Pre
sidio. It was reported yesterday morn-
Ing that the two cases reported the day
previous had turned out to be varioloid;
but In the same report there was informa
tion that three more '"suspects" had been
round, i jd had been added to the number
of those In Isolation. The regiment ap
pears to be in for a protracted stay at
the island.
The work of recruiting up the battalion
of the Fortieth Infantry, assigned to the
Presidio, is progressing very slowly and
It bids fair to take until well along in
the fall to get the four hundred and odd
men needed. So far there are less than
one hundred men in the command and
they are coming in by ones and twos a
lay. Notwithstanding this experience
with the Fortieth and the almost dis
astrous result of the attempt to recruit
the Thirty-fifth Regiment on this coast.
the Government will try to recruit a bat
talion of the Forty-third here. Several
ofacers of the Forty-third will be ordered
here and the work wSI be commenced at
once, but when there Is so much trouble
to secure men for the Fortieth the Forty
third can have but a poor chance. Only
uncssigned recruits are assigned to the
Fortieth and the same .'- will apply
to the" battalion of the Forty-third.
Three hundred and fifty of the recruits
now at the Presidio will be sent down to
the Sherman this morning to be sent
away with the Thirtieth Regiment.
A board of officers met at the Presidio
Thursday to examine four members of
the Minnesota regiment for commissions
in the provisional army. The candidates
were Captain Clarence Bunker of Com
pany C. Lieutenant W. H. Johnson of
Company F. Battalion Sergeant Major W.
A.. Loie and Private Poehler of Company
D. It will not be known who are the
lucky ones until the report of the board
has been sent on to Washington and the
successful candidates are notified of their
appointment. There are four commissions
to be given to the regiment
The Twenty-ninth Infantry will be the
next to arrive. It was recruited in the
South Atlantic States with headquarters
tn Savannah. It passed through E. Paso,
Texas, a few days ago. and will arrive
here some time next week unless delays
Dccur on the road. The TwÂ«nty-eighth is
also being recruited in th Southern
States, but as vet it has not progressed
far enough to make itseif talked about.
Major Parker W. West, inspector gen
eral of volunteers, has been ordered to
proceed to Manila on the transport Sher
mar. which will sail to-day, instead of
an the Grant. *â 'â â ' â â 'â¢'â !
First Lieutenant Russell C. Langdon of
the Third Infantry has been assigned to
iu'y as quartermaster and commissary of
the transport Charles Nelson.
Acting Assistant Surgeon Thomas K.
Mullins has been assigned to temporary
duty at the general hospital at the Pre
sidio pending his assignment to Manila.
" Major Franklin A. Meacham. surgeon
ol volunteers, has beer, ordered to report |
to "the commanding officer of the troops i
on the transport Sherman for duty with
them durir.g the trip to Manila- On ar
riving at Manila Major Meacham will re
port to the commanding general of the
Department of the Pacific.
Â«
Kept Their Places Open
Six members of the First California
Regiment were customs employes at the
time of their enlistment, and they will be
reinstated in"'. sen-ice if they notify
Collector Jackson to-day that such is their
1 desire, otherwise their places will be filled
In the usual manner out of several hun
dred patriots standing on the outer thres
hold of the eligibl-i iist ready for work.
The soldiers whose positions are ready
for them, are T. J. McCreach. assistant
weigher; C. E. Ke^sler, extra assistant
weigher; S. I. Maiston, extra assistant
weigher: H. F. Buthraff, inspector, class
E-'a H. Clifford. inspector, class E;
Lloyd' Spenser, clerk to Surveyor Spear,
Mr Spenser Is Mr. Spear's personal ap
pointment, but the others are to be ap
pointed by Collector Jackson.
Th- positions have been kept by the
Collector for the men under the provi
sions of a circular rssued by the Secretary
of- the Treasury dated April 14. IS9B, and
the- proclamation of President McKinley
dated June 1, 1599. The Treasury circular
was to the effect, that employes who en
listed for the war may be reinstated un
der civil service rules at any time within
twelve months from the time of separa
tion from the service.
The President's proclamation provided
that the men might be reinstated with
out regard to the length of time, presum
ably spent in the army or navy.
Of fifteen extra positions which the Sec
retary of the Treasury created at the re
quest" of Special Agents Smith and Linck.
the Collector filled only nine, leaving six
vacancies for the boys in khaki. â  Thes^
appointments will be for positions of
equal grade and commanding equal pay
as those vacated more than a year ago
by the volunteers.
Lieutenant Percy L. Badt of the First
California Regiment has been appointed
secretary of the employment committee,
and he has taken up his headquarters in
the Red Cross tont in Union square.
G. W. Beyreuther, city plumbing in
spector, has undertaken to provide as
many as possible of those of the regiment
who are plumbers with positions. He has
already secured the promise of twenty
five places and he is seeking for more.
The Artillery Men.
At 3 o clock yesterday afternoon the
men pf the southern battery of what was
last week the California Volunteer
Heavy Artillery took the special train pro
vided for them and started for home. The
battery r, go direct to Los Angeles and
there â¢he men will get a reception that is
worthy of them. They are from all over
the southern counties, but everybody will
be at -Los Angeles to greet them and
there they will have a royal time.
Throughout the war there was no com
mand that made a cleaner record than
did- the California Heavy Artillery. It
made no mistakes and whatever duty
came in its way was well performed. It
has received only the highest praises from
the generals with whom the command
has served and It has done much to up
hold the fame of California's troops in
the field. While the celebration here was"
In. progress the artillery was merged in
the local regiment and the regiment re
ceived most of the notice, but in Los An
gelea there will be no one but those who
wear the red and the whole city will be
the reception committee.
The men will receive breakfast at Fres
noâa breakfast provided by the ladies of
FreÂ«no headed by the members of the
Red Cross Society of that town. The spe
cial train with the artillerymen will
reach Fresno at 9 o'clock and will be
there an hour. It is expected that the
train will reach Los Angeles about 12.30.

William Flannigan's Death.
The ca^e of William Flannigan, a musi
cian of the Thirteenth Minnesota Regl
tnerit, who ditrd at the City Receiving Hos
pital Tuesday night, has been laid before
the Coroner by the military authorities
on account of come discoveries made at
an autopsy performed yesterday morn-
It was believed the man had died from
alcoholism and his body was turned over
to th<? military authorities by the Coroner.
The doctors of the hospital made an au
topsy and found several large blood clots
on the man's brain, one of which they de
termined had caused the man's death.
Whether the blood clot was caused by a
blow or a fall the doctors were unable to
discover, so the case was reported back to
the Coroner for his actidn.
Detective Ed Gibson has been detailed
Colonel H. C. Kessler of Butte, Mont.,
Commanding First Montana Infantry, United States Volunteers.

$ CONRAD REIGELHUTH. â¦
Oakland Office San Francisco Call. :
- - Broadway. Sept. 22.
The trial of the sensational breach of
promise suit brought by Jane Hodge,
aged 50 years, against John Nicholl. the :
aged capitalist, familiarly known as "the j
Duke of Richmond." for (60.000 damages, ;
was terminated In Judge Ogden's court j
to-day.
As soon as court convened this morning
Attor - â â  M behalf
of the defense announced that they would
submit the rase without argument. As
a result Colonel W. W. Foote of counsel
of the plaintiff did not have an oppor
tunity of delivering the eagerly hoped for
closing argument. Attorney Xusbaumer
therefore had the distinction of posing as
the prime and sole debater, whose elo
quent words before the jury yesterday
appear to have carried great weight and
left a forceful impress'on upon the minds
of the twelve men In whose hands the
fate of the aged capitalist rested.
Not a great amount of time was con
sumed by Judge Ogden in giving his In
structions to the Jury. In his charge
Judge Ogden included the instruction that
plaintiff must prove by a preponderance
of evidence that the promise of marriage
was absolute and 1 from all conditions
and â  - es, and that if the jury
found plaintiff had released him and he
had accepted the release men the verdict
must be for the defendant. If on the
other hand the lury found that plaintiff
had established her case tney might look
beyond the contract itself for the meas
ure of damages, to consider the mental
suffering, wounded feelings, mortification
and pain of plaintiff, and also take Into
teratlon defendants financial condi
tion and general reputation for wealth.
If the jury found that defendant Is In
curably incompetent and so informed
plaintiff then she cannot recover dam
ages.
Bo Jrtly after 10 o'clock the case was
submitted to the Jury. At 3:30 o clock
i tfternoon a verdict had been agreed ;
upon, but Judge Ogden had in the mean
time hurried over to San Francisco on I
other business and did not return until
nearly 6:30 o'clock, when the jury came j
in. Foreman Zabel announced the ver- \
diet as given ar
At the request of Major Mhoon of coun
sel for the defense the jury was polled,
but the verdict proved to be unanimous.
By consent a stay of execution and pro
ceedings was granted for thirty days.
After adjournment it was learned that
the jury had Â©allotted at least fourteen
times and that ths damages favored by
some of the Jurors ranged from 110,000
upward a few being satisfied that Miss
Hodge was entitled to the full amount of
$50 000 for which she sued defendant, who
is her uncle by affinity.
Further than this none of the Jurors
would discuss matters pertaining to their
deliberations as they passed out.
The damage assessed is just one-half
â  the amount sued for. and according to
Nicholl's testimony his wealth aggregates
i about $500,000, which is now incorporated
| under the title of thd John Nicholl Com
pany. | ,

JUDGE STANLY'S
CAREER ENDED
Oakland Office San Francisco Call. PO9 Broadway. Sept. 22.
JOHN A RTANI.Y. one of the best known jurists on the. Pacific Coast,
died at his home. 1221 Jackson street, early this morning. For over two
weeks Judge Stanly has been critically ill and death was not unex
pected. He was at his country' home in Napa County at the beginning or
September, when he was attacked by sickness. A few days later, while
at the Palace Hotel, his Illness suddenly became critical and he was re
moved to his Oakland home two weeks ago last Wednesday.
Judge Stanly was born in North Carolina 66 years ago. In his early
life he practiced law in his native State. After the war he removed to this
coast and over a quarter of a century ago he took up his residence in this
City For many years he was a member of the firm of Stoney. Stanly <k
Hayes He was appointed County Judge of San Francisco by Governor
Haignt and was afterward elected to succeed himself. In 1890 he was a
candidate for Supreme Judge on the Democratic ticket, but was beaten by-
Judge Beatty.
Judge Stanly was always an element in the conservative politics of
Oakland and was chairman of the Board of Freeholders that drew up the
present city charter.
It 13 on account of his connection with the celebrated Garcelon trust
that Judge Stanly was brought most prominently into public notice. By the
provisions of this trust Judge Stanly and Stephen W. Purington, a nephew
of Mrs Garcelon. were appointed trustees to carry out the wishes of Mrs.
Garcelon. Judge Stanly was the only surviving trustee, and as there Is no
provision In the trust for the appointment of successors to the original
trustees there is now no one alive to administer the trust. This status is,
likely to cause some legal complications in addition to those already exist
ing.
Mrs. Garrelon also named Judge Stanly as one of the three trustees of
the proposed Samuel Merrltt Hospital. He was also the last of the original
trustees, but in this trust provision Is made to nil vacancies. The deceased
leaves a widow and one daughter. Mrs. T. P. CoghilL The funeral will take
place Sunday afternoon from St. Paul's Church, of which the iate jurist
was one of the founders.

SAYS HE WAS
NOT THE MAN
WITH THE AX
Strange Story of an
Untried Murderer.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
908 Broadway, Sept. 22.
Frank H. Cheesman, who in cold blood
red Henry J. Brooke in August.
. *â - -hereafter shot his sweetheart, Etta
I â¢â . and who was subsequently ad
judged insane and about two months ago
escaped from the insane asylum at Napa,
was returned from Kalispel. Montana, to
day by Deputy Sheriff ODonnell. The
Insane murderer will be detained at the
County Jail until to-morrow, when an of
from Napa will take him back to
the asylum.
When seen at the County Jail to-day
Cheesman appeared perfectly sane. He
looks better than ever he did. He talked
quite readily on such matters as published
accounts and rumors of his being the
"man with the ax," who assaulted H. K.
Beiden at his home here one midnight
about the time of Cheesman's escape,
and who later visited the home of his
former sweetheart in the Potrero. San
Francisco, and there threatened to do
some chopping. But aSI these rumors,
said Cheesman to-day, are false.
He declared that he escaped from the
asylum by crawling through a transom
ai.d lowering himself to the ground by a
rope made of his biankets torn in strips.
From there he went to Vallejo the same
night, crossed the ferry to Port Costa and
n de a brakebeam on a train to Oakland.
"When I arrived here on that day." said
.-man. "I walked down Washington
street, passed the County Jail, pulling my
bat down over my eyes, and nobody
recognized me. I also visited my father' s
home in Berkeley. He gave me some
ey and I crossed r " San Francisco.
where I remained 'shady' several days in
a water front lodging-house; but I never
went to seek Etta Payne."
Thereafter, Cheesman says, he went to
Seattle and secured work in a tunnel for
a few we<?ks. finally drifting over to Da
kota and Montana, where he says he be-
I'ain-- a cowboy.
"I earned about $47 there and got
drunk," he continued, "and while in that
condition I told the Sheriff at Kalispel
that there was a reward of $3iÂ«)0 offered
by the Oakland authorities for my arrest.
He clapped the irons on me and at the
prison treated me royally until he learned
that no reward had ever be*n offered.
The insane murderer takes special de
light in relating one of his experiences
while in the Indian section of Dakota.
"While walking across the plains one
day " says Cheesman. "I met a young
halfbreed Indian girl who had been bitten
by a rattlesnake. I took out my knife.
cut out the fangs and dressed the wound.
She insisted I go to her people with her.
I did so and her father gave me ahors
and saddle to help me on my way.
Cheesman c. pressed confidence that
some day he would be legally freed ana
be given a chance to redeem himselt.
Whether he will ever be tried for the
Brooke murder depends solely upon the
determination of the asylum auth-r
On one occasion, shortly after Chees
man's commitment, they informed the
District Attorney that the murderer was
not insane; in fact they con teftded that
he never had been insane while at the
asylum. He was promptly brought back
to Oakland, when a jury adjudged nil
sane nevertheless and hence he was
committed to the asylum at that time.
Ordered Her Own Coffin
ALAIIEDA, Sept. 22.-Mrs. Marie Cath
erine Silva, sometimes known as Mrs.
Ruhling, who came to Alameda _ in xsoo,
died this morning at her home. lal3 fatan
ton street, at the age of 61 years.. About
s*x months ago she concluded that she
wÂ«i* going to die and ordered a coffin sent
to her house- The undertaker, on arriv
ing at the place, discovered that the
w. man was not yet a tit subject for the
cemetery and the casket was taken baotc
to the s"hop. At that time, however, she
made all arrangements for her funeral.
Her requests were that she should be
buried in the clothes she had on at the
time of her death, and before her body
was placed in the coffin it was to be
pinned up in a sheet which she had pre
pared for the occasion, but under no con
ditions should there be "any buttons
placed on the sheet." She also requested
that no embalming fluid be used In pre
paring her body for burial, and that she
be interred as soon as possible and with
out services at either the house or the
grave. The latter part of her request,
however, will probably be ignored, as be
fore death she professed religion, having
become converted to the Catholic faith.

Still More Counterfeiting.
The Secret Service has Just unearthed another
band of counterfeiters and secured a large
quantity of bogus bills, which are so cleverly
axecuted that the average person would never
suspect them of- being spurious. Things of
great value are always selected for imitation,
notably Hostetter's Stomach Bitters, which has
many imitators but no equals for disorders like
Indigestion, dyspepsia, constipation, nervous

HUNTINGTON IN
EXILE IS SLATED
FOR OLD HONORS
Nephew to Reascend
the Throne.
SCHEME OF CRAFTY UNCLE
PBOPOSIH) RESTORATION IS THE
TALK IX YELLOW BUILDING.
The Banished One Is In the Adiron
dacks Awaiting the Signal
to Return to
Power.
â When H. E. Huntington was deposed i
from the position, which gave him author- j
ity In the yellow building and also con- |
ferred upon him a deal of prestige in San
Francisco, the prediction was made In
The Call that he would be restored to
local leadership. It 16 now regarded as
certain that Nephew H. E. will come
again and occupy the chair of authority :
which is now fllled by George Crocker. j
The nephew, according to the dispatches, I
is In the Adirondack* gazing on the foil- ;
age as It takes on the fresh touch of au
tumn color. His uncle will give him the
signal when it is time to come out and :
â do business at the old stand in California. \
The reinstatement of H. E. Huntlngton j
"\rtll in no wise reflect on George Crocker's \
â ability as a railroad manager, but it will \
i gratify the pride of C. P. Huntington,
â whose vanity increases with his years
and bis wealth. He acquired a dislike for
'â¢ Charles Crocker when the Central Pacific |
â Railroad was in course of construction, ;
â and It pleases him to perpetuate the dis- !
like to tho succeeding generation of j
jCrockers.
Collis P. Huntington Is a cunning old
â fox. He mado no outcry when his nephew '
â¢was discarded, but acquiesced in the de-
Cree of change with seeming grace and
[satisfaction. He gave a glad hand to :
tGeorge Crocker and caused the news to â 
â be circulated that he entertained the
highest regard for Will Crocker, the son
'{who never forgave the slights which t
Huntington sought to cast on his father.
While making outward demonstrations ;
Of friendship for the Crockers the crafty
; financier at the head of the corporation j
â was planning for sweet revenge. There
.â¢was a subdued note of triumph in his re
cent utterance "that many people in San
Francisco would like to know the names '
of the buyers of Southern Pacific stock." j
The fact is now very clearly foreahad- J
owed that the negotiations to buy the .
Crocker holdings were Bet in motion by
Collis P. Huntington, and when the deÂ«al is
closed and the stock duly transferred he |
will be master of the situation. Men who
have known Huntington for many years â 
and who comprehend his strength of char- j
acter and admire his boldness and judg- i
ment hold to the belief that his plans are
formed with the purpose of making
Nephew H. E. his" successor and principal
heir. When H. E. Huntington returns
several men in the yellow building who
did not go to the depot to see him off will i
go up the road to meet him. Such Is hu- i
man nature in the yellow house.
The accessible J. C. Stubbs, next to |
Collls P. Huntington the ablest railroader
on the line, will surely give H. E. the
glad hand, although it is known that on
the dethronement of the nephew Stubbs !
exclaimed, "Long live George." C. P. j
Huntington perhaps knows all about the
attitude of every mother's son in the. rail
road building, but ho would forgive Stubbs '<
where ho would punish one whose value
is small. There is a twofold purpose in
bringing Stubbs into the story. Since the
operating department has been ditching i
cars, smashing engines and enlisting eulo
p\cs from the undertakers' association the 1
freight department has hardly been men
tioned in the public press.
Prominent bankers of San Francisco â 
have not the slightest doubt that Collie P.
Huntington planned the scheme to acquire .
the Crocker interests, and they express
the opinion that the negotiations have
been successful. The agency in San Fran
cisco of Speyer & Co. is the London. Paris â¢
and American Bank. It is said that the j
negotiations could have been carried for
ward without the knowledge of the local
agency. An exceptionally large transfer
of money through the London. Paris and
American Bank to the bank of Crocker, |
Wool worth & Co. might cause the con- ;
.lecture of a deal In railroad securities
wherein the Crockers were interested.
Will Crocker still, declines to discuss the
reported transaction and refers all appli
cants for information on the subject to
George Crocker and Bpeyer & Co. The
declination to discuss the topic is not
coupled with anything like a denial that
negotiations are in progress. One readily !
gains the inference that the report Is in
the main correct.

Â« SAVED BY MRS. PINKHAM. <â 
[LETTEX TO i!KS. FINKHAM NO. 72,896]
â¢'You have saved my life, snatched
me from the brink of the grave almost,
and I wish to thank you. About eigh-
teen months ago I was a total wreck,
physically. I had been troubled with
lenoorrhcea for some time, but had given
hardly any attention to the trouble.
" At Last inflammation of the womb
and ovaries resulted and then I suf-
fered agonies, had to give up my pro-
fession (musician and piano player),
â was confined to my bed and life became
a terrible cross. My husband sum-
moned the best physicians, but their
benefit was but temporary at best. I
believe I should have contracted the
morphine habit under their care, if my
common sense had not intervened.
*' One day my husband noticed the ad-
vertisement of your remedies and im-
mediately bought me a full trial. Soon
the pain in my ovaries was gone. lam
now well, strong and robust, walk,
ride a wheel, and feel like a girl in her
teens. I would not be without Lydia
E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound; it
is like water of life to me. I am very
gratefully and sincerely your well-
wisher, and I heartily recommend your
remedies. I hope some poor creature
may be helped to health by reading my
story." Mrs. Cot,. E. P. Richabdsos,

EXPLOSION ON THE SHERMAN AND ITS VICTIMS.
ONE of the most serious accidents
which has occurred since Govern

to the Philippines happened in the for

the Folsom-street wharf about 9 o'clock
last evening. Two stevedores, John Burke,

Frank N. Klein, residing at 1015 A Langton

John Brodie. residing at 652 Linden ave

About thirty men, under the supervision
of William Andrews and John Trebell.
were engaged in stowing away boxes of
bullets and priming caps in the forward
hold of the" vessel. Their occupation was
uneventful until about Â» o'clock, . when
Frank Klein, one of the men mortally in

among the other boxes, causing the dis

BRUTAL TEACHER
CRUELLY BEATS
A LITTLE BOY
Bridewell Evans Se
verely Punished.
A case of exceeding severity on the
part of a school teacher in the punish
' m-nt of a pupil is reported from the
Spring Valley Evening School on Broad
i way, near Polk street- For the offense
Of throwing a piece of paper across the
school room. Bride-well H. Evans says
he was beaten almost into Insensibility
;by the principal, J. B. Sykes. The
weapon with which Sykes punished the
hoy was a pointer, an Instrument about
the size and weight of a billiard cue. Ac
' cordinsr to the boy's story, when it was
j reduced to splinters on his body, the
teacher resorted to a strap, but finally
throw it aside and beat the lad on the
head and face.
Young Evans, who Is not quite 14 years
' old, is a son of Captain John H. Evans,
j, residing at 1703 Leavenworth street. He
I has been attending the night school for
| the past six months and has never pre

! He has been ill for the last two weeks
j and had barely recovered from his sick
i ness when he returned to school Monday
of this week.
Thursday night his teacher. Miss O'Sul
llvan, caught him committing some minor
j Infraction of the rules and as a punish
ment made him sit on the platform be
| side her. While seated there a boy throw
I a wad of paper at him, hitting him on the
i mouth. Evans picked it up and tossed it
â  back into the class. Miss O'Sullivan re
ported the matter to the principal, Mr.
I Sykes who sent for the boy forthwith.
"I was not allowed to make any ex
planation of what had happened, '" said
! the boy when seen at his home last even
j ing. "The principal picked up a pointer
; and told me to hold out my hand. 1 re
fused to obey him and he began hitting
Ime over the legs and body. When the
I stick broke into pieces he came after me
with a strap, but that did not do much
damage and he threw it aside. I told him
he was afraid to take a fellow of his size
and he Jumped at me with his clenched
fist. He struck me several times on the
head and face until everything got black
around me and I could not tell what he
was doing. After that he made me stay
in the schoolroom for an hour and a half,
I when some of the boys had to take me
I honae."
In corroboration of his statements the
boy exhibited various severe cuts and
bruises from his head down to his ankles.

DODGE BEGINS
TO APPEAR IN
HIS TRUE LIGHT
He Cannot Lose That
Polltax Rake-off.
STUFFING IN HIS "DUMMY"
TAXPAYERS MUST PAY DEAR
FOR HIS JUGGLERY.
The Doctor's Eagerness to Make Po
litical Capital Compels the Citi
zens to Pay More Tribute
to the State.
The truth with regard to Assessor
Dodge is dawning on a deluded public.
The Call has shown to taxpayers the way
behind the scenes, where they could de
tect his jugglery and see through the
magic that made a "dummy" assessment
roll speak so loudly the praises of its !
creator. The very figures furnished by
Dodge have risen up to confound him.
He can get away fiom them only in one
way, and that he is preparing to do by
going into court In answer to a suit for
delinquency to be liled bv_ the District
Attorney, and admitting that his dummy
t3 stuffed and that he is the stutter.
In his own defense, In answer to The
Call's charge that he has atuffed the as
sessment roll, Dr. Dodge has made the
admission that "over $Â£1,000,000 remains
on the roll in excess of last year's roil, on
which it is certain that taxes will be col-,
lected." Now, taking this palpable jug
gle for the absolute truth, Which it is not,
in what relation does it place the dummy
roll to the Siebe assessment roll of last
year? Dodge's dummy roll this year foot
ed up $405,111,615. Deduct from it this
$25,000,000 on which, according to his own
admission, taxes remain to ue collected.
The balance will be $350,111,615. Taking
from "tins other assessments upon whicn
taxes will not be collected for the reason
that they were illegally assessed by
Douge in ignorance of plain provisions to
the contrary on the statute books, it will
cut his dummy down to less than $375,
--000,000.
'i he difference then between the Si=be
roll at $352,344,061 and the Dodge roll of
1375,000,000 its just $25,000,000, on which at
the current tax rate of $1,806 the taxes
brought into the city treasury would be
about $300,000. That would be a very tidy
sum, not to be sneered at, if it were not
the fact that at the same time it took
$150,000 out of the pockets of the taxpay
ers to put into the coffers of the State for
no particular benefit to Ban Francisco.
But Dodge has done even worse than
that. His dummy made ;so much fuss
parading around as a $400,000,000 creation,
although it was only a trumpery bundle
of rags, worth may be less than $375,000,
--000, that the eyes of the State became
fixed upon it. in consequence, while the
taxpayers of San Francisco only paid into
the State treasury in 1898 under the Siebe
roll of $352,344,061 the sum of $1,719 ,435,
they have bean forced by reason of the
Dodge dummy roll of $405,111,615 to pay
Into the State treasury the sum of $2,471,
--208.
To make it so plain that no one can
misunderstand it. San Francisco, by rea
son of Dodge's manipulation of the as
sessment roil, has paid more than $700,000
more into the State treasury than it would
have been called to contribute had the
juggling doctor ' kept his hands off the
roll left by Siebe. For this enormous sum
forced out of their pockets by Dodge the
taxpayers of San Francisco get nothing
they had not last year, except Dodge â
and he's certainly not a bargain at that
price.
Instances of this port of costly padding
of the assessment roll are numerous in
the work of Assessor Dodge. One will be
sufficient to show how his scheme works.
Take the case of the San Francisco and
San Mateo Railroad. Dodge put that
company on the roll for $135,200 for its
franchise, track in San Francisco County,
rolling stock, etc., despite the fact that
under sections 3664 and 3665 of the reve
nue laws of the State it is expressly set
forth that railroads operating in more
than one county shall be assessed by the
State Hoard of Equalization. Dodge paid
no -attention to these provisions, which
are so plain that no one can mistake their
meaning. He had only one end in view;
he wanted to swell that assessment roll,
and he figured that any old thing would
do, and down went the San Francisco
and San Mateo Railway Company for
$135,
Under date of August 26 last Auditor
Wells received notification from the State
Board of Equalization that it had as
sessed the San Francisco and San Mateo
Railway Company for a total valuation
in the two counties in which it operates
for $150,000, the taxes on which would be
paid into the State treasury. That noti
fication' was what would be termed a
'Vail down" for Dodge, the artful dodger
with the dummy. His assessment of the
Contra Costa and the Oakland water
companies seems to be on a par with this.
Assessor Dodge may be ready to do
some more crawfishing with regard to
these assessments, but it will certainly
coma with bad grace from him to plead
ignorance of a law so plain as that pro
viding for the assessment of a railroad
operating In more than one county, when
he has displayed such knowledge of the
workings of the poll tax law. It will
have a tendency to make the doctor look
like 30 centsâ especially that 30 cents he
has taken without distinction from rich
and poor alike in his personal capacity as
poll tax gatherer.

LEES REFUSES
TO CLOSE THE
NYMPHIA HOTEL
Four Clergymen Make
Vain Appeal.
A stormy interview over the closing of
the infamous sink of vice known as the
Hotel Nymphla was held in Chief Lees"
office yesterday betweea Leea and four
prominent North Beacb clergymen, who
went there to request the Chief to order
his men to close the den. At the climax
of the Interview two <>f the clergymen,
Rev. Father T. Caraher, recta* of St.
Francis Church, and Rev. Dr. I'rray of
the First Methodist Episcopal Church,
arose and left the Chief's sanctum in dis
gust.
Chief Lees not only refused to close the
infamous resort hut he made his declara
tion to the visiting clergymen in tones
that could be heard outside in the corri
dora of the City Hali.
Shortly before noon Rev. Father T.
Caraher, Rev. Dr. L'rmy, Rev. Father
Rodham of St. Peter's and St. Paul's Ital
ian Church and Rev. Dr. Slocombe of the
Green-street Congregational Church
called upon Chief Lees to request him to
close tho resort immediately, as a con
viction against the directors of the insti
tution had already been secured in Judge
Graham's court.
Chief Lees took refuge behind the ex
cuse that it would be Impossible to close
the filthy den until Judge Graham passed
sentence upon the directors of the resort
and he told the clergymen flat-footedly
that he did not intend to enforce the law
until that had been done.
Father Caraher, however, came armed
with legal advice, and he informed Chief
Lees that he not only had power but it
was his duty to close the Nymphla im-
argument between the Chief and
the clergymen became intensely < warm.
Lees commenced to roar out his ulti
matum in tones loud enough to be heard
at the ferry, and the clergymen left him
theater was reported to the
residents "â â¢ North Beach they at once
decided to take steps to have the law/en
forced and for that reason it was decided
w call a monster mass meeettog to be
held Monday night at a place which will
be decided upon to-day. The residents of
the beach through their able attorney, J.
J Barrett, will take legal st.-ps if neces
sary to force Chief Lees to close the
lN lttorSy Barrett has been busily en
gaged in the Police Courts for the past
month waging a battle against the plague
spot and tne residents and clergy of North
Beach do not intend to allow the victor}
to slip from their grasp. Delays, they
say, are dangerous, for if Chief Lees wans
until sentence is passed upon the defend
ants next Wednesday they can succeed
in getting out a restraining order pending
the appeal of the case. It was to obviate
this possible juggling with justice that the
clergymen decided to request C hief Lees
to close the institution.
"We called upon Chief Lees yesterday
morning and were ushered into a side
room where we remained quite a long
time " said Father Caraher when seen
yesterday. "His clerk told us he would
notify us of the Chief's arrival, but he
neglected to do so. We sat there till we
grew impatient, and then we arose ana
entered the Chiefs sanctum.
"Chief Lees flatly informed us tnut he
would not act until Judge Graham passed
sentence upon the directors of the Nym
phla. I was advised by two prominent
and competent attorneysâ one of them a.
judge now sitting on the benchâ that
Chief Lees had the power to close this
horrible den the moment its directors
were found guilty in the Police Court.
"Chief Lees knows this to be a fact,
still he refuses to enforce the law. I
realize that there are powerful influences
against us and that the proprietors of the
Nymphia have a monster corruption fund
behind them in this crusade, but that
should not stop Chief Lees from enforcing
the law. ...
"No wonder we can't get justice with
Joseph Dunne. Chief Lees' private attor
ney, fighting the battle for the other side
"At a monster mass-meeting to be neld
Monday night we will adopt drastic meas
-1 urea to secure tho enforcement of tna
nfviP. Thl v Institution Is a horrible sink
?Â« . ; < No fouler den -was ever allowed
to exist in our city. I have seen boys of
fourteen and fifteen stopping in there on
their way from night school. If allowed
to remain open It would soon corrupt the
morals of every child in the neighborhood
We wanted Chief Lees to close the
Place because it is his duty to do so If
he waits until next Wednesday when the
directors of the institution are sentenced
our efforts may prove unavailing. They
can appeal and get out restraining orders
and resort to other jugglery and the den
or vice will remain open for years to
come. We have had a hard battle to close
this plague spot and we do not intend to
lose our victory through the refusal of
Chief Lees to enforce the law."
After the clergymen departed Chief
Lees said: "They asked me to close up
the Hotel Nymphia at once as the jury
had convicted the defendants, but I told
them that if they could show me any law
for it I would do it cheerfully and would
be glad to have their moral support.
Father Caraher told me that some judge
had told him that I could close up the
place, but I replied that It was not in
my power as no judgment had yet been
rendered and I could not pretend to be
above the law. I also pointed out to them
that the defendants could not again be
arrested till the judgment was rendered.
"I want it understood that the police
started this crusade and I had Officer
Clark taking notes to guide me ever since
the project was started. When we were
ready to proceed I suggested to the other
parties that they should engage Mr. Bar
rett to specially prosecute the case and
he was engaged. I know nothing of the
employment of Mr. Dunne for the defense.
While he was Assistant District Attorney
I got him to prosecute the St. Mary and
Bacon street cases and he did it well.
Now he is in private practice and any
one. can engage his services.
"I propose to proceed against the stock
holders of the company as soon as I can
ascertain who they are. We have been
unable to find W. H. Richards, one of the
directors of the company, and no one
seems to know anything about him. I
think he is a myth.
"Just let me say that as soon as judg
ment is rendered next Wednesday I will
proceed regularly and will do what is
necessary, but if I were to do anything
illegal I would immediately be enjoined
and there is no. necessity for placing my
self in that position."
