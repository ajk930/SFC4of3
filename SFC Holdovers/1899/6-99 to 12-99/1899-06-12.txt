PRESIDENT LOUBET OF FRANCE.
PARIS, June 12. â Yesterday was an anxious day for M. Loubet and
M. Dupuy, but except for a few frothy demonstrations outside of one or
two newspaper offices during the evening everything passed off
satisfactorily, and now. at 1 a. m., the boulevards which were very ani
mated before midnight, are beginning to empty, and Paris is going
to bed with an easy mind.
The anti-Dreyfusite papers vainly try to magnify a few brawls into
a frightful anarchistic riot. The Soir. by such headlines as "A Grand
Prix of Anarchists and Police Agents" and "A Very Expensive Presi
dent," seeks to make out that the whole demonstration in favor of M.
Loubet "was manufactured by the police with the assistance of the an
archists." It der-Inres that the country is paying dearly for a President
who needs an escort "f 85,000 scrldiers and policemen whenever he
leaves the Elysee.
There is no doubt that the fearof disorders kept many society peo
ple away from Ixmgchamps. This is shown by the receipts in the "mu
tuels."' which were l,3SO;OO0 francs below those of last year's Grand
Prix.
With no less than l'>,ooo men under arms the city had more the ap
pearance of the Fourth of July than the Grand Prix. It was a great tri
umph for M. Loubet and an indication of the change in public opinion.
quickly swelled to several thousands.
The windows of the cafe were smashed
and the struggle was continued within.
Finally the mounted police arrived,
clearing the neighborhood and closed
the restaurant. Several persons were
injured. Including a number of police
men.
Several members of the Chamber of
Deputies who attended the races are
unanimous in praisin^ the calm atti
tude of the populace there. The Social
ist leaders were the first to exhort their
friends to display moderation. M.
Juares more than once â  interfered to
prevent the enthusiasm of his follow
ers developing into disorder. "We for
get uur differences' here." he said, "to
assemble around the President of the
republic"
Tine of the features of the day was an
unusually large gathering of Deputies
and municipal functionaries at Long
champ?, less to witness the races than
to testify their adhereence to the exist
ing regime. All the Ministers were loud
ly cheered when going and returning.
Of the forty persons arrested- only a
small number havebeen retained in cus
tody. M. Loubet expressed a wish that
all who had been arrested merely on
account of seditious cries should, so
far as possible, be liberated.
Two policemen were injured by de
monstrators who were trying to rescue
friends from arrest. One, a detective,
was very roughly used. His clothes
were nearly torn off his back and his
revolver and purse were stolen. These,
however, were isolated incidents.
Just before midnight another de
monstration took place outside the
office of Libre Parole. In the scuffles
with the police several persons were
Injured.
Inquiry at the prefecture of police
at a late hour elicited the informa
tion that about thirty arrests were
made during the day and ten policemen
were more or less seriously Injured.
The predominant cries were "Vive
Loubet" and "Conspuez Rochefort."
After the riot at the Pavilion d'Arne
nonvllle the mob marched to what it
supposed was the residence of M.
Rochefort. but not knowing the num
ber of the house, the demonstrators
hooted outside another person's resi
dence. There was considerable mani
festations outside of the ofiices of
i rintransigeant. M. Rochefort, in fact,
i has entirely lost his popularity with the
Socialists on account of his attitude in
the Dreyfus affair.
The Jockey Club held a meeting on
Saturday and resolved unanimously
that M. Loubet, being their guest, must
be treated courteously. Lots were
drawn and Vicomte d'Haricourt was
selected to present a bouquet to Mme.
Loubet. On the other hand, the club
decided that none of the women mem
bers of their families should attend the
races. The attendance, therefore, was
smaller than usual. The admission to
the course produced only 230,000 francs,
as compared with 341,000 francs last
year, while the takings at the betting
machines were greatly reduced.
During the disorders at the Pavilion
d'Arenonville, the gentleman whose re
marks caused the trouble got quietly
out with the lady accompanying him.
Rut they were recognized in their car
riage by the crowd, and in hia terror,
the gentleman ordered the coachman to
whip up his horses, trying to pierce the
crowd at a gallop. The mob, however,

seized the horses and maltreated the
occupants, whose clothing was torn,
and they would have suffered more had
not several sympathizing Socialists
cried out. "Leave the aristocrats
alone." At this the carriage was al
lowed to depart.

PARIS, June 11.â M. Trarieux. for
merly Minister of Justice, gave a dinner
and reception last evening in honor of
Lieutenant Co-lonel Picquart. Among
those present were the Prince and
Princess of Monaco, Mme. Dreyfus, M.
Mathieu Dreyfus and others prominent
in the movement for Dreyfus' revision.
M. Mathieu Dreyfus threw himself
into Colonel Picquart's arms, while
Mme. Dreyfus was so much overcame
that she fainted.
PRICE ON THE HEAD
OF EACH OUTLAW
Army of Man-Hunters to Invade the
Wyoming "'Hole in the
Wall."
CASPER, Wyo., June 11.â The Hole in
the Wall, for years the refuge of outlaws,
promises to be cleared of its desperate in
habitants. The daring robbers who looted
the I T nion Pacific express at Rock Creek
recently and escaped to the fastnesses in
the Hole in the Wall. In spite of the fact
that they were closely pursued over plain
and mountain, are to be systematically
hunted to their death. To this purpose
the several railroad managers with inter
ests in this State are organizing posses,
and the outlaws will be given no rest. It
is expected 200 men will be engaged in
the big man hunt.
The State and the express ami railroad com
panies have offered an aggregate of $3uO each
for the beads of the members of the band. In
addition to this head money. In the event of
success, the men who are arranging for tills
chase 'Will be armed and fed by the corpora
tion* and big cattle companies of this section
durliiK the time they are engaged. Thus the
com|ianieÃ are enabled to enlist a typical han-1
of rough riders, every man of them a dead
ehot. Many of them are cowboys, others are
old frontiersmen, who have fought Indiana in
the same territory over which they will now
pursue the bandits*, and still others are the
trained detectives of the big corporations. The
various bands of man-hunters will be accom
panied by Indian trailers, bloodhounds and
pack trains. The men are all to \te sworn in as
Deputy Sheriffs and will be in Charge of offi
cers' of the several counties in northwestern
â Wyoming.

There are paths over the granite for men. but
not for beasts. Leading In from Montana there
are two or three obscure routes that eventually
enable one to reach the rendezvous of the out
laws, but they are known to but few trailers
and Indian fighters. The man hunters in this
cane, however, who have been hired for an in
definite time, will utilize the known trails
and the end of the outlaw rcljrn in the Hole
in the Wall country is believed to be near.
The six road agents who looted the Tnion
Tacirtc express box will not oppose the small
army of the allies alone. It Is estimated that
at l^ast fifty men on whose heads there are
prices set and who ;ire wanted in many States
are to be found hiding there. Some of them
are following the peaceful pursuits of farmers
and ranchers and seek only to hide their Iden
tity. Many of these men are convicted crim
inals and some of them are under sentence of
death. It Is commonly reported that "Bob"
Taylor, the condemned Missouri murderer, is
living there, herding cattle for another mur

WALLACE, Idaho, June 11.â The
feeling in this community over the in
human treatment of M. L. Devine by
the military authorities is expressed in
the following resolutions adopted by
the Improved Order of Red Men at
Mullan:
Whereas. Michael L. Devine, an hon
ored member of the Improved Order of
Red Men, was unjustly arrested by order
of Dr. France and General Merriam and
incarcerated in a filthy guardhouse, the
result of which was the fatal illness and
death of said Michael L. Devine. and.
Whereas, The dying request of Brother
Devine that he be allowed to go to Provi
dence Hospital at Wallace and die a free
man was denied him by Dr. Franco and
his satellites, and
Whereas, The religious rites of his
church were denied Brother Devine. and
he, although accused of no crime, was
held a prisoner and died through the neg
lect and lncompetency of physicians, and
Whereas, Brother Devine yielded up his
life surrounded by bitter enemies and no
friendly face being allowed at his death
bed to console him and help to prepare
him to meet hia Maker; therefore be it
Resolved, That Flathead Tribe, No. 11,
Improved Order of Red Men, denounce in
unmeasured terms the harsh and brutal
conduct of Dr. France and the military
authorities in doing to death our de
ceased brother and the un-Christian spirit
exhibited by them in denying the conso
lation of his church to an expiring man;
and be it further
Resolved, That although Brother Devine
was not a member of Flathead Tribe, No.
11, yet this tribe in common with the
tribe to which the deceased belonged
nimirn the death of an honorable man,
Michael L. Devine, who was murdered by
Dr. France and the military authorities at
Wardner on the Ist day of June, 1899; and
be it further
Resolved, That our charter be draped
in mourning for thirty days, that a copy
of these rt^jiutlons be spread on our
minutes and a copy be given to the Mullan
Mirror for publication.

Governor Steunenberg, Bartlett Sin
clair and the military seem to have
become intoxicated with power, and
instead of suppressing an insurrection,
which was the excuse for calling on the
President for troops, they are oppress
ing the people, imprisoning men for
expression of opinions and confiscating
the property of those who dare to crit
icize their actions.
Such outrages have never before in
America been perpetrated under the
guise of martial law.
Men who. have been liberated from
the "bull pen" deny the statement o-f
Sinclair that prisoners are well fed and
treated, but assert that the food is of
such a disgusting kind that none but
a starving man would try to eat it.
Witnesses are intimidated and bull
dozed and threatened with capital pun
ishment and imprisonment if they do
not identify persons supposed to be
implicated in the riot.
As was proved yesterday, even the
insane are no-t allowed to escape the
brutality of the military.
The shooting at Johnson was an out
rage which would be tolerated in no
community on earth except one where
the man who ordered it was above all
law.

by Major General Merriam in the

citizens of San Francisco to the
danger the rights of all are exposed to
by such actions, the San Francisco I^abor
Council and the Building Trades Council
have decided to hold a monster mass
meeting on Wednesday night at the Met
ropolitan Temple to protest against the
suspension of the right of habeas corpus
in time of peace, to denounce the suppres
sion of the right of free speech and free
press and to call upon all trades unionists
of the country and upon citizens in gen
eral to hold similar mass-meetings, so
that the methods for the subversion of
civil liberty now pursued In Idaho by Gov

Merriam be checked and American free

At the meeting of <he committee of ar

wa.s decided that unions be requested to
march in a body to the meeting, carrying
their banners. The Brewery Workmen's
Union, which met that night, has already
decided to do so, and others have prom

CHEESEMAN PROBABLY
BELDEN'S ASSAILANT
Frank Cheeseman, self-confessed mur
derer and escaped lunatic, believed by the
Oakland police to be the man who made the
bloodthirsty assault Saturday night on H.
K. Belden of that city, paid a visit yester
day to the Potrero of San Francisco, crying
for human blood. Revolver in hand, he
paraded the streets of the district, proclaim
ing his identity and announcing; his purpose
of killing the woman he failed to slay last
August, when hi shot her father through the
heart.
The woman, who was Miss Etta Payne,
is now Mrs, Fred Knick, the wife of a
laborer at the Union Iron Works. She re
sides with her husband, whom she married
shortly after recovery from the murderous
attack of Chesseman, at 909 Illinois street.
That she was not killed yesterday is due to
the good sense of an acquaintance, who
heard the bloodthirsty lunatic announce his
intention of "finishing that woman,"
and hurried as fast as his legs could carry
him to notify the Knicks of their peril.
They fled from the house for their lives and
notified the police that Cheeseman was run
ning amuck.
In a short time half a dozen patrolmen
were scouring the district for the fiend,
! while Knlck and his wife were hastening to
i police headquarters to implore the protec
! tion of the Chief against the sanguinary
madman. They were escorted to their homes
by officers and guarded last night, while
j the search for their persecutor was con
tinued.
Cheeseman, however, had vanished from
I the scene almost as suddenly as he ap
peared, and up to an early hour this morn
ing had not been heard of. His mania is j
such, however, and he has proved himse.f so
persistent in his hunt for biood that it is be
; lieved by the police, if he is not soon found,
some person will fall a victim to his re
volver.
His appearance in this city so soon after
the attack on H. K. Belden in Oakland,
taken with other circumstances, is almost
conclusive of the fact that he aimed the ax
at the head of the Oakland capitalist. Satis
fied yesterday In that opinion, even before
they heard that Gheeseman had made a sen
sational appearance on this side of the bay,
Detectives Hodgkins and Shorey and other
police officers made a vigorous search for
(he bloodthirsty maniac, but could find
no one that saw him. As soon as they
heard yesterday afternoon that he was run
ning amuck in the Potrero they put strict
watch on all the avenues of entrance Into
Alameda County, and feel certain that they
will bag their man the moment he crosses
the bay.
THE reappearance of Frank Cheese
man in a bloodthirsty frame of mind
has been expected on any of the days
since his escape from the Napa asy
lum. The police of Oakland, Alameda
and Berkeley have kept a particularly
sharp 'lookout for him, it being thought
that he would return to the vicinity of
the home of his parents and the scene
of his former crimes. It was hardly ex-

Sought to Kill Mrs. Knick

City.
peeted. however, that he would pay a
visit to this side of the bay, although he
had manifested his suicidal tendencies in
this city more than once.
While the police of San Francisco were
aware that the murderer had escaped
from the asylum, they did not know that
the girl, whose rejection of him had caus-
Ed the murder of her stepfather and near
ly resulted in her own death, was in this
city. Cheeseman was better informed.
He not only knew that she jfas .in San
Francisco, but he knew the locality in
which she lived and the name and place
of employment of the man she had mar
ried. Filled with a desire to complete his
former murderous effort, he came to this
city yesterday to kill her.
The girl, who was Etta Payne, is now
Mfs. Fred Knick. the wife of an employe
of the Union Iron Works. She lives with
her husband at 909 Illinois street. It was
about 3.30 o'clock in the afternoon when
the presence of Cheeseman in her vicin
ity became known. The man himself was
in a saloon on Kentucky street with sev
eral other persons. He had taken num
erous drinks quietly and would not "have
been noticed had not the old suicidal
ir.anta seized him.
"Hooray!" he yelled, jumping to his feet
and flourishing a long navy revolver. "My
name is Frank Cheeseman and I'm going
over to kill that d d woman. I killed
her father over in Oakland and now I'm
going to finish the job!"
This sudden outbreak and the sight of
the formidable weapon in Cheeseman's
hands caused a quick scattering of the
few in the barroom. The jjjAirderer did
not appear to notice it.
"It'll be all day with you. Mrs. Knick,"
he continued, whirling the revolver,
around his head. "It'll be all day with
you when I flnd you."
Another flourish of the revolver and an
unearthly yell and he was gone, the few
persons who had fled from the saloon to
the street making way for him as he
started in the direction of the Knick
home, several blocks away, emitting un
earthly yells as he went. There was no
attempt to stop him, as those near at
hand rightly guessed that such a pro
ceeding would mean death.
Luckily for Mrs. Knick one young man
in the crowd named Cameron, who is em
ployed at the Union Iron Works and
knows her husband and her history, heard
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
the announcement of Cheeseman. He hes
itated not an instant. Going cross lots
he made for the house, where he found
Mr. and Mrs. Knick. "He told his story
in a few words, warning them to get to
a place of safety, emphasizing his words
by the additional statement that Cheeae
man was even then on the way to carry
out his murderous design.
While Kni'^k busied himself in securing
his wife in safety at the house of a neigh
bor, Cameron notified the police at the
Potrero station of the presence in the
vicinity of the murderous maniac. Patrol
men were sent at once to the scene of the
excitement, and for hours hunted high
and low for Cheeseman. No trace of him
had been found at dusk, and under cover
of night Mrs. Knick and her husband
Journeyed to the office of the Chief of
Police "to implore his protection.
Mrs. Knick made no effort to conceal
her fears that Cheeseman would suceed
in killing her. She was almost on the
verge of hysterics and wept bitterly.
Upon her plea" and convinced that Cheese
man meant to carry out his threat, two
patrolmen were detailed to accompany
her to her home and stand guard during
the night.
This sudden appearance of Cheeseman
gives color to the belief of the Oakland
police that he is the man who made the
murderous assault Saturday night on H.
K. Belden at his residence, Oak and Lake
streets, facing Lake Merritt. The man
ner in which the assault was made is al
most exactly that in which Cheeseman
attacked Henry J. Brooke. The descrip
tion of the man who aimed the blow at
Belden's head answers that of the es
caped lunatic. His appearance in Oak
land was expected at any time, and the
attack justifies the belief of the police
that he was the man.
When the news of Cheeseman's escapa
from the Napa Asylum reached the Oak
land police they notified the peace officers
of the surrounding towns in Alameda
County to be on the lookout for him. They
particularly cautioned Marshal .Lloyd oÂ£
Berkeley that the maniac would be likely
to make his appearance in that town,
where his parents live at 2922 Otis street.
Lloyd has kept a sharp lookout and ia
certain that Cheeseman has not called on.
his parents. They said yesterday they
had neither seen nor heard of him since
his escape and seemed to be under the
irr<j>ression that he was on his way East,
where he has a rich uncle. Cheeseman'a
| father said that even were his son in the
vicinity he would not let him. .know of it.
Although the Alameda County peace of
ficers have not been able to locate

I cd. after they had heard Belden's story,
I that the man they were looking for had
' started out to kill. The similarity of tho
I attack on the Oak street capitalist to that
! last August on the Brooke home was at
i once recalled.
At 9:30 o'clock on the night of that trag
edy Cheeseman rang the bell on the floor
of the house of Henry Brooke at IS Sev^
enth street. Oakland. In the house at tha
time were Henry J. Brooke, his wife and
his stepdaughter. Etta Payne, to wnnni
Cheeseman had been paying attention.
At the summons Brooke went to the door
and threw it open. Without a word tho
murderer shot him dead, then leaping
over the prostrate body he went Into the
house, where Miss Payne and Mrs.
Brooke, having heard the shot, were run

Cheeseman came first upon * the giri.

she standing paralyzed from fear until
the maniac pressed the trigger. At that
; instant, by a superhuman effort, the girl
i struck at the weapon, knocking it down
: as it was discharged, the bullet entering
I her thigh. As she fell Cheeseman caught
sight of her mother, who was sndeavorins
|to hide- herself in a closet. He fired at
; her, but missed, the builet merely cutting
;a. hole in the skirt of h^r dress. Appar
ently satisfied that he had murdered the
entire family. Choeseman ran into tho
I back yard, scaled the fence and made his
i way downtown, where he was captured
I several hours later.
The attack on Belden, though lacking
the motive, partook of the other peculiar
ities of the descent upon the Brooke
i household. If Cheeseman made it. the
' members of the Belden family can con
j gratulate themselves that his first aim
I missed, else the head of the house might
have been foully murdered and the beau
tiful home on I,ake and Oak streets turn
ed into a veritable shambles.
Mr. Belden did not get much more than,
a glance at his assailant, so sudden was
the attack and so dim was the light
thrown from the hall room on the mur
derous visitor. His description of the
] man, however, tallies in a general way
I with that of Cheeseman, which was called
: to his attention yesterday morning by De
tectives Hodgkins and Shorey of the Oak
land department. The momentary glimpse
ho got of the ax-wielder between the
opening of the door and the descent of ti.e
weapon upon his upraised arm revealed
to him a young man. dark eomplexloned
and tall. This would fit Cheeseman to a
dot. Whether he could recognize the man
Hgain if he saw him Belden thinks is
doubtful.
"It all occurred so quickly," he said yes
' terday. "that I didn't have time to take
a good survey of the man. Then again,
when I went to the door, I was expecting:
a telegram and not an ax. When the ring
came to the doorbell I had just retired. I
poked my head out of the window and
asked, 'Who's there?'. A voice, the pos

of the intervening porch, answered:
'Here's a telegram.' As it is not unusual
for me to receive telegrams at almost any
hour I went to the door at once.

Chilkat Medicine Man Puts to
Death a Daughter of

VICTORIA, June 11.â After a perilous
journey over slush-covered and rapidly
breaking ice, snow so soft that they
sank to their thighs and mountain fed
torrents, three miners reached here
early this morning by the steamer Cot

in the but partially explored headwa

adventurous trio â Cesare Prancesca of

near and far reports reached them of
further mortality. With the advent of
the miners and prospectors in the north
the game seems to have been driven
far back into the wilderness, and
whether because of the traffic on the

say, the fish supply has been inade

CIVIL WAR VETERANS
TO COLONIZE CUBA
Paul Vandervoort's Proposition Finds
Favor Among the Blue
and Gray.
CHICAGO, June 11.â A special to the
Chronicle from Omaha, Neb., says: Paul
â i lias received a letter from
I'r< si.: nt McKinley acknowledging re
ceipt of his letter offering to take to
Cuba a great colony of old soldiers of
both the bluo and the gray, whose pres
ri.tii be a guarantee against the
outlawry practiced by some of the Cuban
corpses were laid away in the tops of
fir trees.
One morning: early last March the
tent of the three miners was snatched
open as they sat at breakfast, and in
rushed a swarthy Indian girl. She
threw herself down before them and
cried bitterly. Before they had time
to consider the cause of the interruption
they heard the patter of naked feet, and
a howling mob of Siwashes, headed by
their medicine man, rushed in and seiz
ed the prostrate girl. The miners, un
to save the maiden, followed as
she was carried away. She was car
ried to the Indian hamlet, and after the
Indians had danced around for a few
minutes the Indian chief plunged a
knife Into her body and she sank down
without. a cry.
It was not until the next day that
the miners were enabled to find an ex
planation of the tragedy they wit
nessed. It seems the medicine man
was approached by the famine-stricken
people and asked to make medicine to
stay the inroads of starvation and send
food. The medicine man called upon
the chief to make a sacrifice, and the
young girl had been chosen as the vic
tim. The miners promised secrecy, but.
fearing the Indians would kill them to
silence their tongues they lost no time
in getting out of the district. They
have notified the mounted police and
the troops at the Fort Selkirk bar
racks of the murder of the girl, and
troops will be sent to arrest the chief.
It is probable a relief expedition will
be sent to the famine district.
Each of the returning trio is well
supplied with gold. They say that
riches are to be washed from the Up

of getting food in is solved.

CLEVELAND, Ohio, June 11.â Both the
officers of the Big Consolidated Street
Railway and the strikers are waiting ex
pectantly for 7 o'clock to-morrow morn-
ing, for then there is likely to be serious
trouble. True to its promise of last night
the company made no attempt to move
cars to-day. There was no activity about
the barns or terminals and the big crowds
of strikers and idlers that assembled saw
nothing to excite them.
A number of motormen Imported by the i
company from other cities were taken to
the Lakeview terminus of the road to- !
day, and all that wen- not captured by
the strikers were housed there for the
night. If the strikers do not return to j
work in the morning, as they have been j
notified to do by the company, their ;
places will be filled as far as possible by !
new men and an attempt mado to move j
the cars. This the strikers will not per
mitâor at least they say they will notâ
and while they have, been very quiet to
day there is apparently a grim deter
mination on their part to thwart the ef
forts of the company to move the cars.
There has been some talk of a sympa- i
thetic strike on the part of the employes
of the Little Consolidated Company, but
the leaders of the strike say they do not
desire anything of the kind. On the other
hand* they declare that it would only in- i
jure them to tie up the other lines, for :
it would lose them the sympathy of the
people, who have thus far put up with :
inconvenience and annoyance good na- !

W hat Mr. Haupt says as to the Panama

Photographs That Vouch for the
Excellence of The Call's Bul
letins of the Big Fight.
SACRAMENTO, June 11.â The CaJl
gave to Sacramentans a perfect bul
letin description of the big fight as it
progressed last Friday evening, and the
people appreciated its enterprise. It is
possible that the other papers may have
attempted something in that line, but
claimed in favor of the Nicaraguan route.
Whatever may be the views of individual
members of the commission, the authori
ties consider it a serious breach of pro
priety for them to make known through
public interviews their views in favor of
either route. It has been inferred thai ,i
majority of the members of the commis
sion are in favor of the Nicaraguan canrJ
route, but since its appointment Mr.
Haupt is the only one who has publicly
expressed himself.
There is no doubt that the administra
tion is in favor of the Nicaraguan route
and that it expects to report in its favor,
but in the instructions to the Commis
sioners the President will make it clear
that the will of. Congress must be carried
out and that he expects an entirely im
partial report. To demonstrate that this
is his attitude it was said to-day by a
member of the administration that the
President might relieve Mr. Haupt from
service on the commission for his impoli
tic utterances in favor of the Nicara iuan
route.
PUTTMAN'S FATE
IN THE BALANCE
Case Will Go to the Jury
To-Day.
CONVICT MURDERERS PLEA
CLAIMS HE WAS INSANE WHEN
HE KILLED SHOWERS.
Defense Contends That the Constant
Use of Opium Had Over

Reason.
i
Special Disuateh to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, June 11.â George
Puttman, the murderer of John Show
ers, a fellow convict at Fo-lsom Prison,
will learn his fate to-morrow, when
Judge Hughes will charge the Jury.
The case has attracted considerable at
tention by reason of its unusual fea
tures. It has been claimed that the
murder had its orgin in a certain form
of sentiment. Puttman was once be
friended by the father of Abe Majors,
who was convicted recently erf the mur
der of a policeman In Utah. Showers
had years ago turned State's evidence
and caused the old man's conviction on
a charge of murder. The condemna
tion of Majors refreshed Puttman's
memory of the wrong for which Show
ers was responsible, and when the op
portunity presented itself he slashed
Showers with an improvised dagger.
The tragedy was witnessed by a num
ber of prisoners, most of whom, how
ever, declined to testify unless given
the opportunity to take a trip to Sacra
mento for the purpose. This character
of testimony, for the most part, was not
insisted upon, and the defense followed
chiefly alrmg the line of emotional in
sanity.
When Puttman was called to the wit
ness stand yesterday he said that he
was a victim of the opium habit and
that the drug often made him commit
acts against his will. He continued:
To tell the truth, gentlemen of the jury
1 know very little about this charge
against me. in fact, all I do know is
from what I heard while the witnesses
were testifying. When I came into the
State prison at 11! o'clock I had no knife
I swear before God that I had no knife.
I remember a dispute, but with whom I
ac not remember, r recollect somebody
calling me a vile name and then striking
at me. 1 have a dim recollection of a
struggle and of handing a knife to an offi
cer. Whether I did this or got the idea
from hearing the testimony I am not cer
tain. This is about all I know.

The defense closed with Puttman's
story, and arguments were continued
until last night, when the court ad
journed until to-morrow. A constant
attendant upon the trial was Puttman's

apparent youth made her seem more
like a sister than a parent. She was

DID NOT WARN HIS
FRIENDS NOT TO BET
Fitzsimmons Much Perturbed by the
Story Sent Out From
Cincinnati.
NEW YORK. June U.â Bob Fitzsim
miius, ex-champion heavyweight pugilist,
in company with his wife and his man
ager, Martin Julian, attended a ball game
at West End Field Club, Jersey City, this
afternoon. Fitzsimmons acted as one of
the two umpires, and after the game he
and Julian found time to deny the asser
tions made by Leonard Shilly, who is
credited with being an attache of the
Sheriff's office in Cincinnati. Shilly
claims to be a personal friend of Fitzsim
mons, but Bob says he does not know
such a man, and Julian is equally posi
tive that he never met such a person.
The letter in itself purports that Fitz
simmons feared defeat and advised his
friends not to risk any money on their
belief that he would retain the champion
ship.
"I never wrote such a letter," said Fitz
sinimons. "I don't know Shilly. Who is
he, anyhow? You say he is connected
with the Sheriff's office in Cincinnati.
Well, if he is, I know nothing about the
Sheriff or him. I never wrote such a let
ter. I'm not a letter writer. This letter
in question is dated 'New York. May :;].'
Since 1 went into training some weeks
ago I wrote only one letter, and that was
to Dr. KHly, a dentist of IVoria. 111., but
I made no mention of my chances of vic
tory or defeat in it.
"I'll tell you what I'll do," continued
Fitzsimnums, "in order to show the pub
lic that I never wrote such a letter to
Leonard Shilly or any other person, I'll
give S-jix.! to the pirscin who produces
Buch a document, and furthermore, if any
one believes that he has such a letter I
will pay his expenses from wherever he
resides "to this city and make him a pres
ent of $250, providing that such a com
munication can be produced. Of course,
the letter may be a forgery, if such a
letter exists, but I want to be satisfied
as to its existence and I also want the
public to be satisfied that I never wrote
it nor had it written for me. I am at a
loss to understand why any person could
make such a statement, because I see no
reason why any one should try to 'queer'
me in this underhand manner."
Martin Julian. Fitzsimmons' manager.
was very emphatic in his denunciation of
the report and said:
"Fitzsimmons and I are close friends,
and I know that he never wrote such a
letter. It is a lie oil the face of it. Fitz
simmons is not making any idle boast
when he says that he will give $2500 for
the production of the letter, if it can be
proved to be authentic. This we can
easily afford to do, seeing that we know
that if such a letter exists it must be a
forgery. Now, let these people come to
time, and if there is a negro in the wood
pile we will soon dig him out. If the
letter can be placed in evidence we will

Big Sum Already Subscribed and
Arrangements Made for
a Mass-Meeting.
NEW YORK, June 11.â A number of
prominent Irish-Americans of this city,
who have taken an active interest In
the movement started here to purchase
the Muckross estate and the beautiful
lakes of Killarney, with a view of con
verting the place into an Irish National
Park, met this evening at the home of
James .T. Coogan, president of the bor
ough of Manhattan, to talk over the
project and to arrange for a general
meeting to be held at the Waldorf-As
toria Hotel Wednesday night.
The name men will meet again to
morrow to draft a circular letter set
tin;' forth th>' plan in detail. These cir
culars will be sent to all Irish-Ameri
cans in Greater New York and be fol
lowed by invitations to the general
mccl ing.
James Boothley-Roche, who repre
sents in Parliament the district of Kil
gladly pay $250 to the person presenting
it, a.s well as other expenses, in addition
to the $2")00 promised by Fitzsimmons."
Mrs. Fitzsimmons, who was present,
said that she was positive her husband
had never written such a letter.
"Bob was more than confident of suc
cess, and all those who saw the fight, must
certainly agree with me in saying that he
did tils utmost to retain the championship.
He had no doubt as to his ability to defeat
,Ji (fries, and although he was beaten, I
am not quite satisfied that he cannot re
verse the order of things."
Several rumors are in circulation that
Jeffries has offered to spar with Fitz
simmons at a benefit for the latter, but
Manager Julian sa.id to-night that Jeffries
and his manager, instead of giving a ben
efit, the proceeds of which would go to
Fitzsimmons. had made a proviso that
they should receive 50 per cent of the re
ceipts. When this proposition was made
to Fitzsimmons he and his manager de
clined to have anything to do with it and
stated that when Fitzsimmons gave a
benefit for "Jack" Dempsey, after he had
defeated him, Dempsey received all the
coin. Neither Fitzsimmons nor Julian will
accept half favors from the new cham
pion or his manager, and if they wish to
give the ex-champion a benefit he must
have all.

MOVEMENT AGAINST
FILIPINO BRAVES
Only Four of the American Troops
Siain While the Enemy's Loss
Is About Four Hundred.
WASHINGTON, June 11.â "War Department to-day received a dis
patch from Major General Otis of the military movement to the south of
Manila for the purpose of clearing out the rebels in that secction. It shows
that the movement was a great success, and the enemy's loss was consid
erably greater than stated in the press dispatches. General Otis' cable
gram is as follows:
MANILA. June 11, 1899.â Terrific heat yesterday did not permit
troops to reach positions at hours designated; enabled majority of in
surgents to escape in scattered organization south and westward, which
they effected during the evening and night. Movement great success,
however: enemy disorganized and routed, suffering heavy loss. Troops
resting to-day at Las Pinas and Paranaque. Navy did excellent execution
along shore of bay, but many insurgent detachments retired in that di
rection, protected by presence of women and children, whom they drove
along with them. Our loss, four killed and some thirty wounded. Report
of casualties later. Conservative estimate of enemy's loss about 400.
OTIS.
MANILA, June 11, 8:10 p. m.â The
*^":iipino occupation of the province of
f vite has been broken and as a result
of the present movement the Americans
now control the important coast towns
of Paranaque and Las Pinas. while a
Ion? line of insurgent trenches facing
our south lines has been cleared.
The insurgents have again proved
their facility as dodgers, between 3000
and 4000 warriors, who seemed destined !
to be captured, having disappeared, the j
majority sliding away under cover of I
the night, after righting the Americans j
all day. Pome others came to meet our
troops -with protestations of friendship.
The Thirteenth Infantry lost one man j
killed and six wounded; the Ninth In
fantry one man killed and five wound- !
ed; the Fourteenth Infantry three '
â wounded and the First Colorado Vol
unteer Regiment eleven wounded.
Yesterday's work was the hardest
our army has seen. The battlefield
stretched out across the entire isthmus
from Laguna de Bai to the harbor.
While the troops were advancing the
army gunboat Napidan, in the river
near Taguig, shelled the enemy, killing
several of them.
The monitor Monadnock and the gun
boat Helena shelled Paranaque and
Las Pi has all day with the full power
of their batteries.
The rebel sharpshooters kept in hid
' ing until the American lines had passed
and then attempted to pot stragglers
from the trees. Thanks to their poor
marksmanship this was without result.
The whole country proved to be a
succession of small hills, with boggy
ground between the high, thick grass,
and lushes in the hollows, which great
ly added t" the difficulty of the ad
vance, but gave shelter that saved
many from the enemy's bullets. Our
men threw away their blankets, coats
and even haversacks, stripping to the
waist and trusting to luck for food.
Water could not be obtained, and there
was much discomfort after the can
teens were emptied.
,\t the outset the CoJorados, the
Ninth Infantry and the Twenty-first i
Infantry forced the line of insurgent ,
trenches, wheeled to the left and drove
the enemy toward the lake. During
this maneuver the Filipinos in con
ceak-d trenches on the right opened an
enfilading fire, but the brigade, partly
owing to the high grass, had few hit.
The Ninth Infantry crossed around
to the right, flanking the trenches,
driving out the Filipinos and killing
many of them.
The Colorado Regiment advanced to
the lake. Two companies encountered
| trenches on top of a knoll, where the
' Filipinos stood waist high above a
trench^ pouring a volley upon the ad
vancing Americans. The Colorado
troops charged and drove them out,
Lieutenant Colonel Moses being wound
ed in the arm as he jumped into the
trench.
In the meantime General Wheaton's
column advanced one and a half miles
toward Paranaque, where the Ameri
cans found a strong trench on a ridge,
out of which they drove the Filipinos
by hard fighting.
The enemy tried to flank the dis
mounted troops of the Fourth Cavalry
accompanying Major General Lawton,

SLAP AT REPUBLICANS
OF MOKELUMNE HILL
Gage's Appointment of Burleson \
Was Opposed by Party
Leaders.
SAN" ANDREAS. June 11.â The article
appearing in this morning's Call com
menting upon the previous record and
subsequent appointment of Charles M.
Bnrleson of Mokelumne Hill by Governor
G;ige to fill the vacancy created by the
doath of Supervisor Smith, has created
widespread comment. The existing con
ditions relative to Burleson's candidacy
and success had a bearing upon the Sen
atorial light.
Thomas W. Smith, son of the late Su
pervisor Smith, was an ardent Republi
can, and his party turned to him as de
serving and competent. When the time
came for a new Supervisor Smith had the
Vipanizfd strength of the party at his
F;aek and -was confident at success. Bur
'leson wont to Sacramento to see about
his chances with the representatives, and
was told to "go back home and save your
time, as there is no chance whatever for
you to be Supervisor."
BurleÃon know there was a Burns ham
and at the same time they made their
advance, throwing a skirmish line to
flank the Fourteenth Infantry. But
they were easily repulsed, the Ameri
can artillery coming to the crest of the
hill and shelling them.
About 3 o'clock in the afternoon Gen
eral Wheaton's brigade, headed by
General Lawton. who, in his white
clothing and helmet, on a big black
horse, was a shining mark for the
enemy's sharpshooters, circled to the
south of Las Pinas, encountering a
large force of Filipinos in the shelter of
the trees. General Lawton had a nar
row escape. In the first volley of the
enemy the horses of three of his staff
oflicers were shot from under them. The
Colorado Regiment bore the brunt of
this attack and dispersed the Filipinos.
Hardly had they finished off that lot
when a large force appeared in the
rear, which the Ninth Infantry and a
part of the Colorado Regiment drove
away. By this time nearly the whole
division was around Las Pinas.
The Amercians camped for the night
south of the town and in the midst or
a heavy rain.
At 6 o'clock this morning General
Wheaton advanced upon Las Pinas
with a troop of cavalry, the Twenty
first Infantry, the Colorado Regiment.
part of the Ninth Infantry and two
mountain guns, crossing two streams
and entering the town without firing a
shot. He then advanced upon Para
naque.
The women and children and, for
that matter, many men, remained in
the towns. No houses were destroyed,
though many were torn by the shells
from the warships. Everywhere the
Americans found white tlags (lying.
So far as can be ascertained, the
Filipino loss is about fifty killed,
about 350 wounded and twenty taken
prisoners.
The whole country is networked with
trenches and the enemy scurried from
shelter to shelter.
To-day long trains <>f commissary
wagons are carrying provisions to the
United States troops along the road,
which only yesterday was the strong
hold of the enemy, and the natives who
erday were probably carrying guns
to-day doffing their hats and grov
g before the Americans with effu
sive greetings of welcome.
The Colorado Regiment returned to
barracks in Manila to-night. As the
ragged and dusty men marched past
the Luneta, the fashionable gathering
place for Manilans, they were heartily
cheered.
ADMIRAL DEWEY

SINGAPORE. June 11.â The United

Admiral Dewey will land to-morrow

guard of honor, will go to the Govern

CAREER OF
T. C. PHELPS
IS CLOSED
Death Ends the Suffering
of the Injured
Man.
VICTIM OFJCCIDENT
Attempt Will Be Made to Appre
hend the Wheelmen Who
Ran Him Down.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
REDWOOD CITY. June 11.â Timothy
Guy Phelps, one of the most prominent
citizens of this county and of the State,
passed away at his home at San Carlos
this morning at 12 minutes after 11
o'clock. His death was the direct result
of the criminal carelessness of two bicy
clists, having been run down by a tan
dem.
On the morning of May 30 he started
from the house with a bucket of nails and
a hammer, taking the path along the
county road and going south toward one
of his fields. A short distance from home
he was overtaken by a tandem, going In
the same direction, and without warning
was struck down by the Jiving wheel. The
force of the shock throw the riders from
their wheel. They stopped long enough to
inquire of Mr. Phelps where he was work
ing, and on learning his identity they
made haste to depart. A driver for Mr.
Hull, a dairyman at San Carlos, wit
nessed the accident and from him has
been obtained a description of the wheel
men, which has been placed in the hands
of the Sheriff. As yet nothing has been
discovered which would lead to the cap
ture of the men.
Mrs. Phelps has been prostrated by her
loss and is now confined to her bed.
The arrangements lor the funeral are
now being perfected. Services will be held
at tin house on Wednesday and in all
probability Dr. Horatio Stebbins of San
Francisco, who performed the marriage
ceremony of Mr. and Mrs. Phelps, will
officiate. Captain Smith of San Carlos,
Professor Christee of Berkeley and
Charles Leavy of San Franciso have
charge of the' arrangements. From San
i â¢ os the remains will be removed to
<â¢<. ;.r'-ss Lawn Cemetery, when they will
be placed in a vault until such time as
Mrs. Phelps decides upon their final dis
position. Che pallbearers have not been
selected, but will be chosen from the
Loyal Legion, Board of Regents and the
Pioneers.
To-morrow the relatives of Mr. Phelps
will have a cast of the face and head
taken, with a view to finally having a
marble or bronze bust made. Just what
disposition Mr. Phelps made of his prop
erty is ii"t now known, as no effort has
b< en made to discover a will.
Mr. Phelps was one of the noted public
nun of Californiaâ a man of line character
and great intellect.
Mr. Phelps was born in Chenango Coun
ty, New York, December 20, 1824. In !â >!.".
!,"â â¢ went to New York to engage in mer
cantile business, but afterward went back
to ills rural home and began the study of
law. When the reports of gold discovery
in California reached New York Mr.
Phelps abandoned his law studies and
started for San Francisco. He arrived in
this city December 14. 1549. and soon after
ward went to the southern mines, where
issed the winter and sprint,'. In Au
gust. 1850, he established a business h
â i Francisco. The lire of May, l^M,
swept away the bulk of his fortune, but
-established the business and again
prospered. About this time Mr. Phelps
a public career, which did not end
until death closed it. Jit; made, his last
notable political .speech at the Republican
Convention in Sacramento last Au
gust. He then paid a tribute to the char
a< ter and worth of Dr. Pardpe, and in
â  losing announced the withdrawal of the
doctor from the contest. A dispatch to
The Call under date of August 22 thus
spoke of Mr. Fhelps:
"Near the elevator landing on the main
tionr of th>- Golden Eagle Hotel to-day
stood Timothy Guy Phelps. who attended
a Republican Stat.' Convention as far back
as 1856, when John C. Fremont was the
idol of the party and the Candida;.'
airainsc James Buchanan for the Presi
dency of the United States.
"Mr. Phelps studied the animated
throne of delegates with a curious Inter
est 'hat one could observe in the strong
ly marked character lines of his face. X..
doubt he reflected thnt a generation of
leading public men had entered public life
and passed away since he began to con
cern himself in the political affairs of
California. He mused, no doubt, that
many of the young men whose badges
proclaimed their choice for Governor
were unborn when his voice was first
raised in the. Republican councils of Cali
fornia."
In 1^.;4 ho made his first political cam
paign. He ran for the Legislature in
company with Colonel E. I>. Maker, but
was defeated. In 1858 he ran again and
was fleeted to the Assembly. He was
subsequently elected to the Senate and
served from ISSB to IS6I. He -was a repre
sentative In Congress from California
from IS6I to 1M53. In 1859 he attended a
Republican State convention in Sacra
mento and was a ?adidate for the gu
bernatorial nomination, but withdrew in
Favor of. Leland Stanford. E. D. Raker,
D. R. Ashley. Samuel Hell and Frank M.
l'ixley attended that convention. Dele
gates to the number of 150 met in the
First Congregational Church, Sacra
mento.
Io 18(50 Mr. Phelps was vice chairman
of the State convention which met in San
Francisco to send delegates to the his
toric convention at Chicago which nom
inated Abraham Lincolr for President.
Subsequently, while ser\,g in Congress,
Mr. Phelps frequently met President Lin
coln and gained the confidence and high
regard of the great President.
At the Republican State convention held
at Sacramento June. 1861, Timothy Guy
Phelps was again a '-andidate for Govern
or with Leland Stanford his chief oppo
nent. The nominating ballot was 197 for
Stanford and 104 for Phelps. In 1861. after
the Sacramento convention, Mr. Phelps
was nominated for Congress and elected.
At the Republican State convention held
at Sacramento in June, IS7.">, Mr. Phelps
secured the nomination for Governor.
Later on quite a number of disgruntled
Republicans brought out John Bidwell as
a candidate, and the result was the elec
tion of William Irwin, Democrat. Mr.
Phelps' great ambition was to be Govern
or of California, but the fat^s were
against the realization of his hopes.
Failure to attain tho office of Governor
flid not diminish his political ardor. He
subsequently ran for Congress in the
Fifth District, but was defeated by
Thomas J. Clunie. The contest was very
ci'se Clunle's majority being less than
fifty.
Mr. Phelps served two terms as Collect
or of the Port of San Francisco. He was
first appointed by President Grant in 1869
and was appointed "he second time by
President Harrison. Leland Stanford, who
was United States Senator, secured Mr.
i ! elps' second Â«ppoiniment as Collector.
The death of Mr. Phelps causes a va
ancy In the Hoard of Regents of the
State University, which Governor Gage
will be called upon to lill by appointment.
Mr. Phelps was active and earnest as a
Regent. He gave close attention to the
affairs of Mount Hamilton Observatory.
In the board he was rated as a man of
superior ability.
Mr l'helpn was a member of Yerba Buena
Lodge No 16, Independent Order of Odd Fel-
Off to the Yosemite.

WILL EXPLODE BOMBS
TO RECOVER BODIES
Method Adopted in the Search for
Victims of the Catamaran
Disaster.
STOCKTON. June 11.â Extraordinary
efforts are to be made to recover the
bodies of Mabel Kalitz and Walter D.
Henderson, who lost their lives in the
catamaran Wave disaster. To-morrow a
party acting under Instructions of Cor-
oner Clark will search the river, using
bombs or dynamite on the surface or in
some manner not to injure the fish. All
pools and localities into which eddys are
likely to have carried the bodies will be
searched. It is thought the bodies must
be within a mile or two of where the ac
cident occurred, as there Is an undercur
rent caused by the tide which does much
to stop the effect of the swift current
which runs in the center of the river.
Some question was raised as to whether
this method is permissable under'the law,
but the Coroner will place the bombs on
boards or in some kind of a contrivance
so that the law for the protection of fish
will not be disregarded. The search has
been stimulated by rewards offered by
citizens, who sympathize with- the sad
condition of the mother of Miss Kafltz,
who prays for at least the consolation of
having her unfortunate daughter interred.

FRITTERED AWAY
Alaska Grand Jury's
Sensational Report.
DENOUNCES AN OFFICIAL
SUPERINTENDENT OF EDUCA
TION ACCUSED.
Alleged to Have Deliberately Falsi
fied to the Government Regard
ing the Work in His
Field.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
JUNEAU. Alaska, June 6 (via Seattle
June 11).â The grand jury of the United
States District Court for Alaska has
made a sensational report on the conduct
of educational matters in Alaska. The
report reads:
In the hope that it may be able to effectu
ally reach some remedial power or authority
the Grand Jury desires to direct attention to the
deplorable condition of educational affairs in
Alaska.
The blame cannot be Justly laid at the doors of
Congress. Between the years ISS4 and 1597 in
clusive there was appropriated for education in
Alaska an aggregate o f $415,000â a sum which
had it been judiciously expended ought to have
Kiven Alaska a school system fairly commen
surate with the requirements of our people.
We do not undertake to say that there has
been any dishonest or direct misappropriation
of any part of this large sum of money, but we
do aver that a considerable portion of It has
been frittered away in payment of the ex
penses of wholly useless summer Jaunts by
the general agent of education to remote parts
of the Territory and In the establishment of
schools at points where none were needed, un
less, indeed, it be conceded that the education
of the children of a people who
"By day catch the ermine
"And by night chase other vermin"
Are to be given the preference over those of
the intelligent white people who form the ad
vance guard In the march of civilization into
Alaska.
Hut for the reason that it believes that a
large amount of money has been uselessly ex
pended, and, the truth not being made mani
fest, will continue to be expended under the
direction of the general agent of education in
Alaska, while yet the neglect of our educa
tional interests is prolonged, the Grand Jury
would hesitate to refer even causually to his
extraordinary scheme for revolutionizing the
mode of travel and transportation of mails and
supplies in Alaska by the introduction of do
mesticated reindeer from Siberia. But we sub
mit that his utter neglect of the duties for the
performance of which he is paid a salary and
the consequent demoralized condition of our
educational system demand and justify even
a harsher criticism than that which follows.
We charge that this man is untruthful, and
that lie has persistently embodied In his
official reports concerning educational matters
in Alaska that which he knew to be absolutely
false. He has charged time and time again in
his official reports that the clergy of the Greco-
Russian church oppose the teaching of English
in their schools and threaten parents that If
they allow their children to learn English their
boys will be taken away and put into the Ameri
can army as soon as they are old enough to do
duty as soldiers, whereas the truth is that
Knglish has always been taught In the princi
pal Greco-Russian schools. If he has been
guilty of deliberate falsehood In his official re
ports on education in Alaska what reliance
is to be nlaced on those he makes concerning
the use of reindeer in Alaska? The plain, sim
ple truth Is that each and every attempt at t lie
use of reindeer for transportation In Alaska
has been a failure.
The Grand Jury, therefore, earnestly protests
against any further recommendation for the
Importation of domesticated reindeer, and re
spectfully begs and prays on behalf of a l.?ny
suffering people that the honorable Secretary of
the Interior may in his wisdom see fit to ro
lleve Alaska of the incubus of an official who
enjoys neither the respect nor the confidence of
any considerable portion of her people, white
or native, and whose days of usefulness so far
as Alaska Is concerned were long since burled.
SCENE SHIFTS IN THE
BAKER-HOWARD FEUD
Barboursville Now the Mecca of the
Contending Kentucky
Factions.
B ARBOURS VILLE, Ky.. June 11.â
Since the change of venue was granted
at Manchester, Clay County, yesterday
for the Baker murder trials to be held
in the Knox County courts this city has
been in a state of excitement. It will be
impossible in this place, which has a pop
ulation of between two and three thou
sand inhabitants, with good officers, for
euch a tragedy to occur as that at the
village of Manchester yesterday, under
the shadow of the court, when Thomas
Baker, the recent defendant, was shot
dead while a prisoner of the court. As
Thomas Baker had killed William White,
a brother of Sheriff Beverly White of
Clay County, and as the crowd saw the
rifle fired from a window in the Sheritt s
office at the time Baker fell dead into the
arms of his wife, it is thought that there
may be another trial soon and a change
of venue to this place.
When Jesse Barrett turned State's i-vi
dence last Friday "Jim" and Dee Baker
and Charles Wooton were released, as well
as Barrett, the confession showing they
were not implicated. The new indictments
were returned against Thomas Baksr and
his son "Jim" and Wiley Baker, a brothtr
of Thomas, for killing Wilson Howard
and Burch Storr and shooting 'Bat"
Howard with intent to kill. The four de
fendants were released by Barrett's con
fession, and now the fifth by assassina
tion, leaving only Wiley and "Jim ' Baker
to be transferred to the jail here unless
additional arrests have been made to-day
at Manchester, a point twenty-six miles
from a railway, telegraph or telephone
station.
Colonel Adams, who had a battalion ami
a Gatling gun at Manchester the past
week and has done effective work not only
in quelling the mob last night and in
bringing refugees into court earlier in
the week, but also in holding back the
fighting feudists all week, was expected
here to-day with Wiley and â¢â¢Jim" Baker,
guarded by the militia, but they have not
iet arrived.
GERMANY'S
STAND CAUSES
UNEASINESS
Prospect of a Failure of All
Important Plans at the
Peace Conference.
DIPLOMATS IN DOUBT
Proposals of America for a Perma
nent Court of Arbitration
Destined to Be Shelved.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
THE HAG'JE, June 11.â An
authoritative contradiction is
given to the report that there is
grave danger of the arbitration
scheme failing. It is pointed out
that, although Germany may
hesitate to recognize the prin
ciple, she has not yet raised any
actual objection during the dis
cussion.
WASHINGTON, June 11.â While
hopeful that some recommendation in
the interest of peace and civilization
â will be made by the conference at The
Hague, considerable discouragement is
felt by diplomats and officials here as
the result of the announced hostility ;
of Germany to the plans for interna
tional arbitration.
It is undoubtedly true that Germany >
is endeavoring to obtain sufficient votes
to reject the resolution favoring the
scheme for international arbitration, I
and there is a disposition to believe '
that she will get them. In this event one I
important result of the conference,
which the President and his advisers j
expected, will not be accomplished, j
and from present indications it looks j
as though the meeting w,hen it ad
journs will have failed to adopt any of
the ideas which caused the Czar to is
sue his invitation.
Information from The Hague is re
garded as indicating the certainty that
no plan for the limitation of arma
ments will be adopted,, and that there
will be no important modifications of
the treaty of Paris of 1556, but there is
yet a chance that the majority of the
conference will declare in favor of the j
scheme for arbitration of disputes to I
be referred to a tribunal by mutual
consent of the parties thereto.
It is considered probable that the |
Geneva convention will be amended so j
as to apply the rules governing
warfare on land to warfare at sea, but !
j this is all that is now hoped for.
The authorities have recited the Brit
ish scheme of arbitration, which Sir
j Julian Pauncefote is pressing', and
which is reported to have met with
more favor than the American plan.
They sincerely regret that the confer
ence is unwilling to organize a per
i manent tribunal, as proposed by the
! American plan, but every effort will be
| made to amend the British scheme so
| as to embody in it the essential points
I advocated by Embassador White and
I his associates.
CURRENCY REFORM
IS NOW IN SIGHT
Next Congress to Take
Action.
ATTITUDE OF HENDERSON
NEW SPEAKER WILL HASTEN
LEGISLATION.
Proposed Laws to Be in Accord With
the Plan Outlined by the House
Republican Caucus
Committee.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CALL HEADQUARTERS. WELLING
TON HOTEL. WASHINGTON, June 11.â
Monetary legislation along the general
lines of the plan outlined by the Repub
lican Caucus Committee of the House
will probably be enacted next winter.
The selection of Mr. Henderson of lowa
as Speaker of the House will better the
prospect for financial legislation. Mr.
Henderson was chairman of the Caucus
Committee which drew up the pro
gramme, and he will exercise his power
as Speaker to bring it forward in the
House and cause its passage.
While Mr. Hopkins probably would
ITave done as much in the Speaker's place
as Mr. Henderson toward securing mon
etary legislation, the advocates of cur
i rency reform are congratulating them
| selves that Mr. Henderson rather than
â¢ Mr. Hopkins is to be Speaker. It is well
! understood that Mr. Hopkins would not
: have exerted himself to bring the matter
i up or have arranged the membership of
! the Banking and Currency Committee so
| as to make an agreement on any partic
ular plan probable.
Efforts will be made to get the pro
posed bill through both houses as soon
as possible, so that new legislation will
; have been in force some time before the
j Presidential election next year. The Re
i publican majority in the House is small,
but it is believed there will be little dif
! flculty in securing a practically unani
! mous vote of the party for such a mod
| crate measure as that proposed. It is not
impossible that Democratic support might
be obtained for it.
In the Senate there can be no question
about the Republicans having enough
votes to pass the bill when It is brought
forward as a party measure.

upon any undue inflation, as the banks did

far as we on this coast are concerned, there is
ing strained or fictitious in the situation. Busi
n a legitimate basis of supply and de
mand. Produce and merchandise are active simply
ise there 1- an actual consumptive demand for
â  ement, as pi minted out last
week, is heavy, and tne exhaustion of supplies of those
largely in California impel- buyers to
purchase heavily to till the deficiency. Especially is
canned fruits, which, at
this tim< ir, arc the leading staple. Stocks
of canned fruits are exhausted, and the canners are

all of which are better

out that the di f 1898 was a blessing in di^
>aned the decks of an accumulation of
produce and merchandise and left them clear for the
current harvest. It is not probable that we shall see
her such season for some years, and it behooves
us to make the best of it. bearing in mind that next
jrear may see the conditions reversed, with an abund
< ' and low prices. Hence the
prosperity of this year should not lead us into extrava
gance
For the rest there i^ little to be said except that
there are no disquieting signs in sight. Trade is
monotonously active :<t good prices for almost every
thing produced in the State. Collections are not hard,
money is abundant, with a slow but certain tendency
toward lower rate> of interest, and failures are small
and unimportant. Like a ship sailing gracefully on a
smooth sea there is nothing to be said except that the
\v*eather is fine.
As it is predicted the new pugilistic champion will
stay with the job for ten years, it is clear our troubles
are by no means ended. The amount of challenging
and counter-challenging, toning and retorting that
can be done in that time is enough to make even the
most sanguine feel a sense of dread as he faces the
awful uncertainties of the future.
STREET RAILWAY BONDS.
A O >MMUNICATION from ex-Superior Judge
F. W. Van Reynegom, published in another
lumn, is worthy of attention. If the view he
s of the effect of the decision in Hunt vs.
rect, then a- to tl c outstanding bonds of
â  â¢ : .et Street Railwaj â  : Â»8 to
s, i i :< d street railways

irity exists beyond those already recapitulated in

oblij yen bj a corporation as an evidence of
md that, under Hunt vs. Ward, th
â  'hue which sets the statute in motion, then

c< mcerned.
But we hope tl le case is not quite so bad as it ap-
Judge Van R< and that, notwith
standing his views of Hun; vs Ward, the personal lia
bility of stockholders to pay their pro rata of street
railway bonds may survive. That liability arises un-
I der article XII. section 3, of the Stan ( onstitution,
eh is rmt self-executing, but has been fully en
tion 322 of the Civil Code. If it he the
. where the original indebtedness and the obliga
| tion which extends the time for its payment for a
term of years exceeding three are coincident, that a
kholder is protected by limitation before a right
ction against him accrues, the constitutional
â  1 for bondholders is destroyed. To hold thai an
gation which prevents a corporation from 1
linsi its stockholders a right of ac
.<!:;. h is incapable of actual enforcement would
equally frustrate the intention of the framers of our
ntal law. In fact either hypothesis would be
urd.
This <â¢â :-!â  of Hunt vs. Ward.. 09 California Reports,
2, his be< n widely interpi eading to
these nonsensical conclusions. About six months ago
ex C hief Justice Currey, who at a great age retains
ectual vigor and takes a deep interest in
law questions affecting the welfare of the people, pub
ed a very searching criticism upon the opini<
M-e. in which the widespread evil that would re
- nl oi si ime of its pi
gently pn ' Some of his lan
:- a forcible application to the immediate
question in hand: "II is a common practice for â 
the State to borrow large sum- of
; terms of years, for which they issue
interest bearii payable in ten, fifteen, twenty
or more years after the date ni their issue. Are
in such cases presumed to have waived and
quished all right to look for payment to the
kholders as a prospective indemnity against the
of their m \ ested?"
In the case oi French vs. Teschemacher, 24 Cali
fornia Reports, p. 558, it was early decided and it
has since been frequently held that the personal lia
bility of stockholder.- could be waived, but only by
contract. In the opinion of some able lawyer-. Hunt
vs. Ward, when restricted to the exact question it in
volved, can be easily construed so as to avoid an en
â d waiver that would be an obliteration of the
liability itself. In that case, after the foreclosure of
a mortgage against the corporation and the ap]
tion of the proceeds of the sale oi the mprtg
to the payment of a note, there was a judg
ment over for a deficiency which it was sought to en
! primary liability of the stockholders. This
ipt conflicted with the settled law of the State
that the original indebtedness fixed that liability
! which could not afterward be enlarged or extended
bj co or by litigation between a corporation
its creditors. The complaint also, as Mr. Justice
i McFarland .stated, did not attempt to aver the date
v. hen the indebtedness for which the stockholders
were actually responsible accrued, and there was noth
; ing left for the Court to do but to infer the fact from
I the date of the note. Without discussing the ques
therefore, whether the grdunds upon which the
on w is placed transcended the necessities of the
situation, the decision itself harmonized with our
precedents. For example, in Stilphen vs. Ware.
,45 California Reports, pp. no. m. where a judg
ment against a corporation had been treated as the
inal indebtedness that the stockholders could be
pelled to pay, it was decided that this position
was unsound and that the personal liability applied
usively to the indebtedness upon which the judg
men! was obtained, which in that instance was for
services rendered. The injustice of permitting the
duration of the liability of stockholders to be extended
out their consent by corporate acts or by pro
nips against corporations is too palpable for argu
ment. It could only be paralleled by judicial deter
minations that would accord to them total exemp
tion.
The true rule, with which Hunt vs. Ward probably
may be reconciled, is that the personal liability of
stockholders arises concurrently with the first exist
ence of an indebtedness against a corporation that
can be legally enforced, or, in other words, that is
due. Whenever a right of action against a corpora
tion is complete, the three years' statute of limitations
vor of individual stockholders begins to run. Tin,
is the law as established by Davidson vs. Rankin, 34
California Reports, pp. 505, 506. Mitchell vs. Beck
man. 04 California Reports, p. 122. flyman vs. Cole
man, 62 â California Reports, p. 653, and by sev
eral other authorities in this State, and it is scarcely
sible that it will be permanently overturned or ob
structed by Hunt v 5. Ward.
Apart from equitable proceedings in cases of fraud,
the first legal right of action on their bonds against
street railway companies exists at maturity, when it is
most likely that the additional constitutional and
statutory protection to the public will simultaneously
arise. But this hopeful view of the future of bond
holders does not detract from the necessity of con
sidering the doubt that ex-Judge Van Reynegom has
tersely and appropriately suggested There is no
conceivable view either of the law or of the facts
in which the bonds of the Market Street Railway
Company or of the corporations it has absorbed, in
the face of expiring franchises, diminishing securi
ties and the absence of proper sinking funds for their
redemption, in the sense of ordinary financial busi
an be considered safe. The argument against
them remains intnet. although ultimate collection may
be still regarded as probable.
THE EXAMPLE OF GERMANY.
PV CCORDING to the Oregonian evidence that
/ \ the German flag is rising in the carrying trade
of the ocean, plentiful in all ports of the
world, is exceptionally striking at Portland, where, !
the Oregonian says, the nucleus of the grain fleet <>f
the coming season now consists of six German and
but two British vessels.
Such a disproportion between the number of grain ,
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL. MONDAY, JUNE 12, 1899.
ships of the two nations will of course not continue
through the season, but. as the Oregonian goes on to
[point out. "considering that the German flag was
almost a curiosity in this port a few years ago. the
showing is a remarkable one. Germany is not only
crowding her shipyards right up to their limits in
producing steam tonnage, but she is buying all sail
ing vesse ding them into fields oi
trade that for ages have been regarded as the special
preserves of the British -hip-owner."
It is notable that the contrast established by our
Portland contemporary is between Germany and
Great Britain. Portland is an American city, and the
grain to be transported across the ocean is an Ameri
can product, and yet the amount of American ship
ping in carrying the ocean trade 1- so -light
it i> noi considered at all. It does not even come in
for a mention.
Such a condition of affairs is by no means credit
able to our Government. That American enterprise
ami energy are superior to those of any other peo
ple is well known. That truth has been attested in a
hundred ways. At the presei I time we are supplying
â machinery for nearl) every country in Europe, and
for the British tin; 1 their work of develop
ing Africa. Yet we lag behind all nations in ocean
-hip building in proportion to our commerce.
The cause of the difference between our accom
plishments in manufacturing industry and in ship
ping i.- too plain to escape the observation of even
the most casual student of the subject. We have
given to our industries on land ample protection, and
.. a consequence they have become the most pros
perous and among the most extensive in the world.
We have neglected, on the other hand, to give any
kind of protection to our merchant marine engaged
ir foreign trade. Thus, while we surpass rivalry in
c industry, we are hardly in the race in the
other.
I he Germans have shown us what can be accom
plished for ship building by proper legislation. With
out anything like our resoui [vantages, they
have built up men-ham fleets that even on this side
â  ! the globe are competing with the British. Should
the United States adopt the German plan and policy
with respect to shi] - I would noi be long before
the fleets of this coast would .-how the American to
be the rising flag in the trade of the ocean.
THE DEWEY MONUMENT FUND.
r\ F the meeting of the Dewey monument com
/ \ .mittee last Friday, the sub-committe<
gaged in collecting contributions for the fund
made no formal reports, as some of the members
were out of town, and others had reasons for desiring
delay. It was announced, however, that the sub
scriptions now amount to more than $30,000, and
other large amounts are assured."
The movement is one which appeals to the people
of the whole State, it has been received with cordial
approval everywhere. The people - c it is
right and fitting that this . tion should manifest
n- some permanent and. impressive form their admira
the great victory oi Manila Bay, their appre
ciation of it- importance, and their gratitude to the
patriot seaman under whose command it was accom
plished.
Rarely has any movement of a similar nature been
undertaken with better auguries of success. It is but
a short time since it was first proposed and yet nearly
third of the entire amount required has been al
ready contributed. \"<: tl . ontribution has been made,
moreover, without solicitation. It has been the spon
taneous offering of men whose ardent sympathy with
the patriotic enterprise prompted them to act at once.
Nor does it represent the whole amount that will be
given. When the report- of the sub-committees
submitted next Friday the total amount of the
subscriptions will undoubtedly be gratifying to every
citizen who lias a loyal interest in the enterj
In addition to serving as a demonstration of the
public appreciation of the services of Admiral Dewey,
the construction* of a monumental structure of the
magnitude proposed will Rive San Francisco a stimu
lus toward purely artistic work. The adornment of
tlie city by so noble a structure will increase its at
tractiveness and strengthen the artistic as well as the
patriotic aspirations of the people. The enterprise,
therefore, 1- one which appeals to civic and to State
pride as well as to national loyalty, and well merits
enerous and cordial support which has been thus
far so liberally accorded it.
TIMOTHY GUY PHELPS.
BY the death of Timothy Guy Phelps California
loses <,ne Ât the most useful and public-spirited of
its citizens, and the Republican party one of the
most eminent and honored of its leaders. The loss to
both the State ami v, the party is great, ami the death
will be mourned by thousands outside the immediate
circle of his relatives and friends.
Mr. Phelps was one of the strong, earnest men who
joined the Republican party in its early days and
li Iped to win its first victories over the slave power.
His force of character soon made his influence widely
felt, and his personal popularity won for him a fol
lowing that gave him prestige in party councils. His
service to the nation, however, was not confined to
party work merely. As a member of Congress and as
Collector of this port he demonstrated a high capacity
fcr both legislative and executive tasks and per
formed with exemplary zeal and fidelity every duty
which official responsibility required of him.
The salient characterstics which marked the found
ers of the Repnblican party and which were so nobly
and heroically illustrated in such men as Lincoln and
Seward and others of that period, were notable in Mr.
; Phelps. His partisanship was the outgrowth of
principle. Politics was to him a means of promoting
the national welfare and not a struggle for the spoils
of office. The sterling honesty and integrity of the
man were never doubted even by his political op
ponents. His influence for good was everywhere
recognized where his fame was known, and from
all parts of the State cordial tributes of loving praise
will be given to his memory.
A suggestion has been made that America may be
asked to act as mediator between England and the
Transvaal. The little difficulty in reference to the
Alaskan boundary, involved, as it has become, with
England's threat not to permit our exclusive control
of the Nicaraguan canal, may suggest to Washington
that it has its hands full trying to attend to its own
affairs.
Death "has claimed another victim of the Market
Street Railway Company. The railroad is interested
in a very fine local hospital maintained by the money
ff railroad employes. Would it not be well for the
authorities of the corporation to discuss the necessity
of establishing a morgue for the reception of its
victims?
The statements of the Hon. P. Reddy concern
; ing the condition of affairs at Wardner. Idaho, show
, that the situation there is one that ought to be probed
with what is popularly known as "a sharp stick." and
it is gratifying to know the probing is likely to be
, done, and clone well when it gets started.
THE CALIFORNIA QUEST
FOR COPPER AND GOLD
The big copper belt reaching 170 miles
fr.>m Fresno County to Nevada Coun
ty, along the Sierra Nevada foothill
region has been recently brought Into
prominence by the copper boom, and now,
after Wins years ol almost total neglect,
it is the softie of a great deal ol pros
pecting, of small development operations
In many copper claims and of muclvbond
and buying of prospects and slightly
developed mines. The biggest new opera
tions of the present in California arc near
1 "i>ier City in the great copper belt of
La County, and a number of copper
prospects arc being exploited In Plumas
and adjoining northeastern counties, but
copper prospects, Rood and good-for-noth
ing, are inure numerous along 1 the Foot
hill copper belt. Here several mines are
lately being worked in a small way, the
ore being shipped to Selby's.
Herbert Lang has recently made a
study of California's copper regions, and
he published an interesting paper on the
1 i othill copp r bell in the New Fork
Mining and Metallurgical Journal. This
bell lies west of the Mother Lode and
lower down and consists of series of com
plex veins, bearing gold, silver, zii
other "copper minerals" in various de
grees. Th< copper is gem-rally found be
low the zone of oxidation. The widths
of the veins, of course, vary greatly. In
the Shasta County belt the tire occurs
rather In larger lenses. The deposit Is
very wide at Copperopolis. At the Cop
per King mine, recently developed in
no County, it is about fifteen feet
and bears 7 per cent of copper. At the
Spenceville mine in Nevada County it is
forty feet and 4 per cent cop;., r. In the
Satellite at Camp Seco there is thirty
feet of pay ore.
"Thousands of locations have at one
time and another been taken upon the
copper belt and much work done," says
Mr. Lang. "A dozen mines of importance
have been developed, and there are as
many more which give promise of becom
ing such. Tile heaviest producers in past
times tia \ c been those at Copperopolis
ami Camp Seco, In Calaveras County, and
Spenceville, in Nevada County, which
have been the scenes of extensive and at
times lucrative operations. Hack in the
Sixties, When tile tifSt. Cupper excitement
raged in this State, metallurgical pro
cesses were Introduced fi r the treatment
of the ores, and the first water-jacket fur
naces that we have certain and accurate
records <>]' were built to smell tic ores of
the (.â upper belt. The r< trains of Several
i<{ these "M plants are still in existence,
â !i (it course out of use. <>n the bank
of the Mokelumm , a; Camp Seco, the cu
rious traveler may see and examine the
relics of one of the first attempts at blast
furnace smelting In the United Si
most remarkable for the scarcity of slag
and the abundance of 'sows' produced."
He describes four stages of the working
of the mines In this belt In the past. In
the initial stage of exploration and de
velopment, in the sixties, large quantities
of rich oxides and sulphides were shipped
to foreign smelters or reduced In small,
rude and uncertain furnaci s. About ICTO
copper fell half in price, and work stop
pi I. Beginning several years later a few
mines were worked again tor a few years
by the teaching process. The or .-= were
roasted in heaps f â  and then
treated by water, which partially leach
ed out the sulphates, which were precipi
tated on scrap Iron, producing copper ce
ment, i >p,. rations ci â  Ing great
heaps of ore, which have been leached In
a small way for years. Ten years ago
smelting was tried again ai Copperopo
lis and at Camp S< Copperopolis mines
were worked on a large sea;.. Bui op
: s wen stopped In a few months,
and have never been renewed. Mr. Lang
explains the failure by the Imperfi I
of m thods. The produci was noi suffl
clentlj concentrated. The roasting and
smelting produced matte only 40 per tent
copper, and shipping rates to the coast
were hi^h. He does not note another of
the ri â¢â  high cost of coke and
coal at the smelter. He estimates that
00 tons of ore were mined,
; ng, perhaps, 50,000 tons of metal. In
IS9S the Mountain Copper Company of
Shasta County mined 222,000 tons of ore.
Now the fourth period has come, with
feverish efforts to buy and sell properties,
and a general exploitation of this copper
belt. Scores ri f claims are being worked
< again, and many worthless properties
are heint; sold. If the copper demand
. long maintains its present relation to
supply a number of important producing
mines and smelters will unquestionably
i en along this belt.
The anini.il meeting nf the American In
stitute of Mining Engineers to be held in
Sa;i Francisco will begin Its session on
Si pt( mber 25, according to advices frotn
s. retary Rossiter W. Raymond to E.
tl. Benjamin, secretary of the California
Miners' Association. Mr. Benjamin and
the appointed committees of the associa
tion have well In hand the arrangements
that will make tin.- session probably the
Interesting and profitable one the
Institute has ever hela. The event will,
of course, 1 Â£ large Importance to the
mining Industry of the State in many
ways, and the appeals for financial and
other co-operation which will be made
will deserve unstinted response. The mm
Ing resources of the State will receive
large advertisement through the visit of
so many of the representative mining
men of the United States and through
what is written of their stay In the city
and their wide tours for observation.
Secretary Benjamin Is preparing the
finest exposition of the mineral resources
of the State that will have been pro
duced. It will be superbly illustrated,
printed and bound and will describe the
Industry and mineral resources in general
and by counties. Advertising will help
defray the cost. It will be distributed
gratis to members of the institute and to
others will b< sold for probably $f>.
Secretary Benjamin, with legal advice,
has prepared on behalf of the association
a form of location notice, soon t<> be
printed and ready, which the association
hopes will become the recognized form
for use throughout the State. As each
mining district may now prescribe forms
of notice not Inconsistent with the Fed
eral law, a uniform style of notice is
very important.
The Mokelumne River is undoubtedly
one of the gold-bearing streams of the
auriferous region whose beds bold buried
and submerged unworked gravel which
it will pay to work by skillful dredging
on some plan. A Mr. Davis lias invented
:t machine, a. plan and a BCh( me to gel at
of its old gravel bearing "$2 to $5 a
yard," and all of these Inventions seem
new and remarkable developments In the
mining: world to say the least, lit tells
the Stockton Mail about it, and as likely
as not it is all so and all right His nÂ»w
dredger, as planned, "consists of an ap
paratus, either in a boat or on a plat
form on land, for subterranean hydraulic
work. A large t"^i â¢â  Is sunk In the ground
by it. and through pipes two streams of
water are forced with great velocity.
One of t!;i- streams loosens and tears iip
the ground at the bottom of tho hole, and
the other brines up the sand and debris.
The gold is not brought to the surface
with the sand, as might be supposed, but
is washed tree from it by means of a de
vice at the lower end of the pipes and
collects in a pan there."
Tho scene of operations is to be near
Wallace, on the Pan Joaquin side of the
river. Here the bed la a half mils wide
and nearly all dry in summer. "The ap
paratus will be mounted on a heavy
wooden track built in two sections and
placed transversely to the river, the sec
tions being moved alternately as the
work progresses. When the apparatus
has made its half-mile passage across the
tracks will !>â¢â  moved a few feet further
up stream and the dredger will make its
return trip, and so nn."
Mr. Davis has bonded two and a half
miles of the river bed. asserts that his
dredger w-ill handle 1500 yards a day and
at from S3 to $,"> a cubic yard the gross
returns should be $4600 or $7500 daily,"
warranting an investment of $100.000' in
machinery ,
The third odd feature is that this bond
of Mr. Davis' is only for the surface
ground down to and including the first
gold deposit. Another company has
bonded the gravel beds of the ancient
river beds lying further below. Mr. Davis
takes the top or modern deposit with his
dredger. The Milwaukee company, it is
reported, controls the auriferous gravels
"of the Pliocene period" within the same
surface area. In boring they struck gold
bearing gravel at !<."> feet and then went
t;> '_':->,n feet with results so satisfactory
that they will sink b double shaft to that
depth and work by the drifting process.
At several plr.ces big bowlders of rir-h
quarts rock were found lons years ago
and kept a generation or two of pros
pectors hunting for the great ledge. One
Instance is near the Altoonn quicksilver
mine at Cinnabar. Trinity County, where
huge bowlders of pay rock have lain at
the foot of a hill without providing
enough ore for a mill. The tantalizing
mystery of that ledge remains, and there

STREET RAILWAY BONDS.
Are Stockholders Liable for
Them?
Editor of The Callâ Sir: Your editorial
beaded "Street Railway Bonds and
Stocks" in The Call of yesterday makes a
strong and timely showing of tlip dubious J
character of the securities upon which the j
bond Issue of the leading street railway I
of Ban Francisco rests. As the savings of j
many who cannot afford to risk the loss
<>:' any part of their principal Is likely to
be invested from time to time in these
bonds, the press of the city is doint; a
good work when it holds up to public in
sp( ction the facts which show how inade
quate the security is upon which the ulti
mate payment of these street railway
boi 'is depends.
My attention has been challenged by one j
statement in the editorial referred to
which shows that the writer has overlook- j
ed one Important point as to the liability !
nt the stockholders of these corporations.
After calling attention to the fact that no
provision Is made for an adequate sinking
fund for the payment of the authorized
Issue of $17,500,000 of bonds when they ma
ture, and showing that the property
pledged for their payment will be of but ;
little value owing to the lives of the fran- ;
chises of the corporation being near their,
end when the time comes for payment of ;
the bonds, the writer Bays: "when the
securities nave been divested of all value !
cxci pt the property remnants that sur- |
vive the existing franchises, the bulk of j
the indebtedness will have behind it only
the personal liability of stockholders and
such equitable relief as the peculiar man
agement of the monopoly may justify.'
Unfortunately, the bondholders will not
have even the slender security of a per
sonal liability of the stockholders.
A^ to the personal liability of the stock
holders upon these bonds when they ma
ture, there will be absolutely none. Sec- j
tion 359 of the Code of Civil Procedure of
California provides that actions to en
force the liability of stockholders of a cor
poration must be brought within
years after the liability was created. This
provision of law has been successfully In- :
voiced In si veral cases, which have been
decided by our Supreme Court, to protect
stockholders from liability for the obliga
tions of corporations which have matured
mon than three years after their crea
tion. It would seem at first blush that
this a hard rule of law. which deprives
a creditor of recourse against the stock
holders of a corporation upon n claim on
which he cannot bring suit until after the
statutory liability of the stockholders Is
barred by limitation. Hut as was well said
by Judge MeFarland in the decision of the
Supreme Court of California In the case
of Hunt vs. W;.rd (Vol. 99, Supreme Court
Report, page 612), concurred In by Judges
(!â¢â  Haven and Fitzgerald: "Such a con
dition of affairs would not be the m
sary outcome of the law. for the le
Kives the creditor ample room and time to
Bubject stockholders to their independent
liability for the indebtedness of the cor
poration. But if he chooses to make a
contract with the corporation by which I
Its payment of the indebtedness is post
poned beyond the three years' limitation
in favor of the stockholders, he simply
does an act which practli ally waives his
right against the latter." The case of the
Hank of San T,uis Oblspo vs Pacific
Steamship Company (Vol. m.'i. Supreme
Court Reports), is another California case
which denies the creditor of a corpora tioi
recourse against its stockholders under
similar circumstances. In this case the
court says: "It must now be regard..] as
settled law in this State that the liability
Of a stockholder of a corporation to pay
his proportion of Us corporate d.l.ts is
one created by statute, and an action to
enforce that liability must be brought i
within three years after the cause of ac
tion accrues." Later decisions of like Im
port have been given by our Supreme
Court, and the same rule of law was ap
plled by the I'nited States courts in an
action brought to subject the Stanford es
tate to liability for the bonded debt of the
Central Pacific Railroad Company, in!
which action the court held that the es
tate was not liable.
The statute of limitations in California
gives three years after the discovery by j
the aggrieved party of the facts consti
tuting a fraud in which to bring an ac- I
lion for relief upon the ground of such
fraud. Tf some of the many rumors of I
1 rlfaery and venality i:: connection with
the granting of street railway franchises
in San Francisco could be traced down,
and definite legal proof of such frauds in
obtaining them should at any time here
after be had, an action might he success
fully' brought in behalf of the people to
revoke or annul such franchises. This
possibility is an added element of uncer
tainty and risk to be considered in ascer
taining the value of the seVurity for the
payment of these street railway bonds.

NEWS OF FOREIGN NAVIES.
The American practice with sub-caliber
target shooting has been adopted in the
channel squadron of the British navy.
It is proposed to provide the pea-groins;
torpedo boats in the French navy with
two pole masts and leg-of-mutton sails to
serve in case of breakdowns of the on
gin*
The British torpedo-boat destroyer
Kestrel, built at Clydebank, averaged
30.406 knots in six runs over the measured
course, and the Leven, built at Fairiield,
averaged 30.672 knots, and 30.201 knots dur
ing a continuous run of three hours.
Old historical names are being resur
rected in the British navy for the new
ships. Four battleships are to be known
as Russellâ of which there has been three
âDuncan (3), Cornwallis (5) and Exmouth
(2). Of the cruisers King Alfred has had
four namesakes; Clyde, two; Africa,
three; Leviathan, three, and Drake, ten.
Two steamers have been built in Eng
land tor Japanese owners, which in time
of ace will run as passenger and freight
boats, and in war times or in case of
pestilence may be readily turned into hos
pital ships. They are of 4794 tons dis
placement and have a length of 332 feet
and 39 feet beam, and will accommodate
350 patients. A 1
The relative healthfulness of the nine
principal stations of the British navy in
commission shows, according to the sur
geon general's report, the following num
ber of sick persons out of every one thou
sand on the stations: Southeast coast of
South America, 26.75; Pacific station, 2n!i2;
Mediterranean, 36.09; North America and
the West Indies, 36.31 . home station, :;7.N;
Australian, 39.6; East Indies, 43.79; Good
Hope and west coast of Africa, 45.21 ;
China, 46.42. The total average loroe
afloat during 1898 was 80,540 and the death
rate was 5.23 per thousand, including 303
deaths from disease and 117 from injury â
the latter chiefly victims of the Benin
campaign. . . -,
Five ironclads and six cruisers are to be
struck from the effective list in the
French navy and will eith.-r be sold or
utilized for harbor and other service. The
Ironclads aggregate ! I . and are
the Colbert, Trident, Richelieu, Turenner
and Victoreuse. The discarded cruisi rs,
of 15,135 t'.ns total, Arethusa,
Dubordieu, [nconstant, Naiade, Nielly,
Primigault and Rignald de Genoielly. All
these vessels were built between W:i and
LS76, and wen constructed either wholly
or partly of wood and had outlived their
usefulness. Only one Ironclad with.
wooden hull, the Bayard, remains on the
effective list In I h navy and as
she was built in 1880 will soon be relegated
to "rotten row." There are no armored
vessels in the British navy with wooded k
liulls. nor cruisers, and the few comp
vessels are allowed to remain on the list
Bolely, apparently, to swell the numb* c
of ships, for they have no fighting value.
The trials of the British torpedo-boat
destroyers have been highly successful,
the boat exceeding her contract speed of
thirty knots by nearly one knot and the
engines developing 541 horsepower over
the guaranteed 6000. The Mermaid was
built by Hawthorn. Leslie & Co. at N v.
castle-on-Tyne, and is 210 feet by 21 feet,
displacing 320 at a maximum draught of
nine feet. She is fitted with four Thorny
croft water-tub.- boilers to carry 250
pounds of steam, and her six runs over
the measured mile ranged from 2!>.fÂ«'il co
31.301 knots, giving an average of 3'J.!'27
knots. During the three hours" trial at
sea the boat was down to a draught of
5 feet 3% inches forward and 8 feet 3-?*
inches aft. The steam was -"â  pounds in
the boilers and with an ail pressure of
4.96 inches of water in the stokeholds,
vacuum of 22.8 to 22.1, the revolutions av
eraged 396 and the speed 30.533 knots.
The torpedo gunboats Skipjack and
Speedwell have been overhauled at an ex
pense of $264,450 and $255,000 respectively.
which equals their first cost ten years
ago. These repairs have caused some ad
verse criticism against the British Ad
miralty, and the report of Admiral Fair
fax on these boats, ma a few years ago
after the naval maneuvers, Is resurrected.
The admiral reported that the boats were
deficient in speed and coal capacity, and
so lightly built and engined that they
were utterly unreliable. Captain Long, on
the other hand, in a subsequent report,
found the boats useful These contradi^
tory expert opinions show that navy offi
cials are as likely to differ as ministers,

ERNEST E. SMITH SOUGHT
HEALTH AND FOUND DEATH
A Passenger on the
Hyderabad Who
Died at Sea.
Oil Mill I ml wings like a iliiu',J^^^^BWÃMM|[^^M|
for then would 1 fly away andÃ
be at rest!"
With the above quotation ]'>-â 
nest E. Smith, a passenger onl
the British ship Hyd.-rahad.M
surrounded his photograph al
few days before he died. Among theH
captain's papers he found a lare-e ><-â 
luminated sheet a ith the words wovenÃ
among flying doves, forsri t-me-notsM
and violets. In the center of theH
wreath was a vacant oval-shapod^B
space, in which Mr. Smith had plaeedÃ
his photograph. The picture tliusH
framed he had hung over the foot of â 
his bed so that the words were the lastH
thing he saw at night and the first^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^B
he saw in the morning. He died when the Hyderabad was four days out from
Newcastle, Australia, on her way to San Francisco.
Ernest E. Smith was only 32 years old, but nevertheless he was well
known In South Africa as a successful diamond merchant. The climate of the
Cape Colony undermined his health and his doctor ordered him to take a long
sea voyage. The Hyderabad was at that time lying in the harbor of Cape
Town getting ready to sail for Australia to load coal for San Francisco. Two
of Smith's brothers arc prominent physicians, one having a large practice in
New York and the other in Brooklyn. This fact, therefore, decided him to
take passage on the Hyderabad. His youngest brother, who is a lieutenant in
the Cape Mounted Rifles, saw him off, the sick man promising to be back in
Africa again inside of a year.
The Hyderabad made a very long passage to Newcastle and sometimes
Mr. Smith was better and sometimes he felt as though he would never reach
land again. While the ship lay in Newcastle harbor he rallied again, and the
first day out for San Francisco told Captain Scott that when he reached
New York his brothers would soon put him on his feet again. The fourth day
out he was feeling pretty bad and Captain Scott nersuaded him to drink
some champagne. About 11 p. m. on February 28 he lay down on the settee
of his room and for a long time gazed on the picture in front of him, and
Captain Scott heard him repeal "Oh, that I had wings." In response to a
query he said he was feeling very sick. He refused any assistance and the
captain went to bed. In the morning the young man was dead on the settee
with a smile on his face, as though he had welcomed "the beautiful angel,
Death."
The next day the remains of the young man were consigned to the deep
and Captain Scott will send his effects to his father, who is a wealthy Liver
pool merchant.

Clerks I>aly and Downs were kept busy
from morning till night. Between sun

eight vessels passed in through the Gold

the bay was covered with coasters, all

An unknown man committed suicide
! from the Stockton steamer J. D. Peters
last Saturday night. The vessel left
Stockton at 6 p. m. for San Francisco and
all went well until Bouldin Island was
abreast. When off Central Landing the
cry of "man overboard" was raised. This
was about 11 p. m. and the night was very
dark. The steamer was stopped and a
boat lowered, but a search extending for
nearly an hour failed to disclose a trace
of the suicide. A muster of those aboard
show.d that none of those who had taken I
rooms nor any one of the crew was miss
ing, but as four different people saw a
man climb over the rail and drop into the
water, it must have been some one who
wanted to conceal bis identity.

;in great numbers. This order, of course,
affects all of the recruiting stations in the
United States, and as it provides that the

there that within the next two months
th< re will be 6000 of these new recruits at
the Presidio, unless they are rapidly for

four officers on duty with the 1500 casuals.
and they are quickly rounding them into
shape.
Work upon the camp intended for the

LITTLE ONES
CELEBRATED
A FESTIVAL
Children's Day" at
the Churches.
FINE PROGRAMMES RENDERED
â â¦
FLORAL SHIP CONSTRUCTED AT
CENTRAL M. E. CHURCH.
Large Offerings Were Made in Many
Congregations for the Advance
ment of Christian
Study.
A day on which offerings may be made
to the cause of Christian enlightenments*;
named yearly by the various Sunckiy
si-hool organizations of the United States.
It generally falls upon the second Sun
day in June, and yesterday was fittingly
celebrated in many of the churches of
this city by the littla ones. Throughout
the East services of a character most be
fitting such a day are conducted in nearly
â¢ very church, and the West Is rapidly re
sponding to the efforts of making the ob
servance of the day universal.
It is called "Children's day," and from
the appearance of many of the churches
yesterday it has been well named. The
youths who receive ihe benefit of the at
tention to tht-lr spiritual welfare conduct
the exercises themselves, offering up
thanks for what they have received.
Many of the churches made the cere
monies patriotic, and the edifices were
handsomely adorned with national colors.
In every house of worship so celebrating
there was a profusion of flowers, and the
programmes were exceeding interesting.
At the Central Methodist Church the
ceremonies were most unique. A large
flora] ship was constructed by the chil
dren of the Sunday-school and was term
ed the "Ship of State." It was placed to
gether by boys and girls, each represent
ing a different State of the Union, and
each decked with ll.iwers and bunting:.
The exercises commenced with the read
ing of Longfellow's poem. "The Building
of the Ship," and was concluded by bene
diction and an address by Rev. Dr. Locke.
A number of pupils from each class of the
Sunday-school represented some section of
the United States, and one of their num
ber read a poem at which some portion of
the ship was placed in position. The fol
lowing was the programme:
Organ voluntary; "Gloria Patri"; "Creed";
doxology; anthem; responsive scripture read
ing; prayer; singing, "Come on the Wings of
the Morning"; selection from Liongfellow,
"Building of the Ship." Miss Susie Ward; ad
dress to the builders, Arthur Perry as master
builder; laying the keel, builders; frame
work, builders; invitation to States, master
builder; response for New England States,
Miss Llllle Barlow; response for Eastern States,
Miss Mary Johnston; response for Southern
States, Miss Jessie Haskens: response for
Western States, Miss Florence Porter; response
for Pacific States, Miss Nellie McCray; response
for District of Columbia, Miss Anna Edwards;
singing, "The American Hymn": masts and
rig-gins, builders; anchor and chart. interme
diate: selection, Charles H. Marks; launching
and raising colors, kindergarten; crew, Inter
mediate; "The Ship of State," master builder;
singing, "Rise, << Christian Children"; address,
Rev. Dr. C. K. Locke; children's day offering;
benediction.
The idea of the construction of a ship
was suggested to Dr. .Locke and Rolla V.
Watt, Sunday-school superintendent, by
tin .lose proximity of this celebration to
the anniversary of the destruction of
Spanish ships off Santiago.
At the Bethany Congregational Church,
Bartletl street, exercises were also held
and an address to children given by Rev.
AW C. Pond. The programme was as fol
lows:
Orcan voluntary; invocation; responsive
rfadinK; scripture exercise: recitations â "Wel
come to Children's Day," Kthel Casson ; "The
Children's Month," IxHtie Hicks; "Our Coun
try." George Middleton; "Little Boys Make
lien," Howard Sehroeder; "The Little Mis

Eckstein; "Bird Messages," by nve little girls;
"The Lord's Child." Gladys Curtis; "The < \ S.
S. and I. Society and Its Four Sisters'," by six
children; offering.
Children's day was observed by special
services at the Memorial Pr< abyterian
Church last night. The church, at the
corner of Eighteenth avenue and Latona
Btreet, was tastefully decorated with
bunting and flowers. The Sabbath school,
which numbers about one hundred and
fifty young people, conducted the serv
ices, entitled "A Call to Praise," which
Is especially prepared for Children's day
by the Presbyterian board of Sabbath
school work. The responsive readings,
dialogues, recitations and choruses, which
form the services, were rendered earnest
ly by the school, and in a manner highly
creditable to their pastor and teachers.
A special feature of the programme was
the formation of a camp, with Haps and
banners and white paper tents. The
tents contained the contributions of the
children to the Mission Sabbath school
fund.
After an eloquent address by the Rev.
H X. Bevier on the significance of the
exercises of the day the services closed
with the singing of *he hymn "America."
On the lirst Sunday in July a very
hands, ime banner will be presented to
thai class of the Sunday school which has
the besl record In attendance and In
knowledge of the catechism.
yesterday was a red-letter day for the
First Baptist Sunday school of this city.
Hoth morning and evening services were
given to exercises celebrating the fiftieth
anniversary of the school. The church
was beautifully decorated with flowers.
Dr A. A. Whitney, the superintendent,
presided. The music was led by the
Church choir and the large orchestra of
the school. There were special exercises
by the primary class, readings and recita
tions by scholars, reminiscences of fifty
years ago by J. F. Pope, a poem by O. 'I*.
Shuck, read by Miss A. B. White; a vio
lin solo by Miss Johnston, and a chil
dren's sermon on "What the Flowers
Say" by Dr. "Woods.

KRAGNESS LOWERS
AMERICAN RECORD
pn. O. KRAG- I
ED. O. the I
NESS, the I
I great road ri- I
x ~ 'der of Olympic I
Club Wheelmen, I
lowered the Ameri- I
can record for 200 I
miles on the road by I
four minutes yes- I
terday. He covered I
the distance in two I
hours thirty-seven I
minutes less time I
than any other Cal- I
ifornian rider. The I
route over which I
the plucky cycler I
rode was the care- I
fully me asured I
course of California I
Associated Cycling I
Club's relay race. I
Kragness rode the I
reverse way of the I
course, starting and I
finishing in Alame- I
da. His course took I
him through San I
Li andro, Alvarado, I
Newark, Milpitas to I
San Jose and thence I
up the west side of I
the bay through I
Menlo Park. Red- I
w<?od, San Mateo, I
San Bruno to the I
City Hall in this I
city.
The first hundred I
miles was ridden in I
five hours fifteen I
minutes, and the I
(luiiiiii century in I
eleven hours thirty- I
seven minutes. The I
start was made I
from Alameda at I
8:10 a. m. Kragness I
arrived here at 1:27 I
p. m. He . rested I
three minutes and I
then retraced his I
course. On the first I
hundred miles he I
punctured his tire I
at Milbrae and sus- I
tainted two falls on I
the Bay Shore road. |
These detained him fully fifteen minutes before necessary repairs could be
effected. He was given great stance by his clubmates in the matter of
pacing and attention. Among the tandem teams that helped at various parts
of his journey were: Edward McNesa and Irving Orth; L. H. Smith and Henry
Bailey; William Jackson and William Henderson; George Kroetz and Albert
Bean: T. H. White on a single.
His times were carefully checked by Captain Spillane, the younger, F.
G. Montealegre and C. C. Williams.
Kragness' performance stamps him as the greatest road rider in America.
Had weather conditions been favorable and with no accidents to delay him
he would have made a still more material reduction in the record. He fin
ished strong and showed no ill effects from his hard ride.

first advanced the runners t" third and
second respectively. However, that was
as far as they grot, for O'Neil drove a
corker to Stultz and was fielded out at :
first. That was pood ball.
Sacramento was tirst to break the ice.
McLaughlin opened the fifth with an in
field hit and stole second. Stultz flew to
Muller, and Sheehan followed with a
drive to Iberg, who went astray, allowing
the batter to reach first and McLaughlin
third. Then "Hutch" touched off his firat
hit. scoring McLaughlin. Hutch's drive
got away from Billings, letting Shee
han go to third and "Old Hoss" to
second. Here Kiley got foxy. Billings
threw the ball to third and Josh tucked
it under his arm when Sheehan was not
looking, and when the youngster led off ;
from the bag he was promptly tagged out.
Harvey was given his base, but lberg as
sisted "Doyle out at first, and the tumult
was over for the time being.
Hank's hustlers mad. it ev< n up in the
seventh. Krug opened with his second |
three-bagger; Kiley hit up a foul fly to
Hutchinson, and Billings was given his
base. Hilderbrandt ripped off a single to
right, which got away from Harvey,
sending Krug across the rubber. Billings
to third and Hilderbrandt to second. Mul
ler and O'Neil were easy outs.
From that time on until th^ thirteenth
not a man connected with the plate, al
though in the eleventh Krug opened with
a double, but never got any further. In
the thirteenth, however, Frisco looked
like a sure winner, when a man was
scored after two men were out. Pyne

was safe on Sheehan's fumble. He Btole
second. Riley hit to Doyle, who caught ;
Krug between second and third. Josh
going to second. Sheehan's second error
let Riley complete the circuit, but Hil- '
derbrandt ended the inning with a fly to I
McLaughlin.
After the kind of ball that had been put
up it looked like all day for Sacramento,
and the crowd prepared to make a rush
for their overdue dinners. Even the play
ers started to put on their coats when
Stanley went out, Riley to Pyne, and they
began to gather up their bats when
Bhanahan popped up a fly to the doctor.
But just then something happened that
made the Senators drop their bats, pull
off their coats and yell, an.l the specta
tors to flop back into their seats. It was.
McLaughlin who caused it. Waiting until
he got a ball to his liking he lifted it into
deep right center, and when the sphere
got back into the diamond Mac was
perched on third.
Then Stultz, who has not been hitting
hard of late, let two beauties go past
with. nit attempting to flag them. Again
coats and bats were reached for, but
Jberg sailed up another one and Stultz
punched it out for a clean single, scoring
McLaughlin and tying up the score again.
The crowd was still shouting when Shte
han retired the side with a fly to Riley.
Muller. the first man up for the locals
in the fourteenth, reached second on a i
pass and O'Nell's sacrifice but Swindells
fanned and lberg was thrown out at first
by Stultz. Then came the finale of a
memorable event in baseball circles.
Hutchinson, first up. smashed out a
beauty to center. Harvey planned to sac
rifice ' him to second, but Iberg juggled;
the bunt and both were safe. Doyle sent
up a fly to Pyne, and then Epan dupli
cated Hutch's shot, scoring the winning
run with only one man out.
To-day the big fight will have been for
gotten, and the town will find fresh food
for discussion in the great ball game. The
scores of the two contests are as follows:

WARSHIP PROVES
A SURPRISE TO
THE LEASHMEN
Wins the Open Stake
at Union Park.
DID NOT FIGURE A WINNER
BETTORS COULD WRITE THEIR
OWN TICKETS ON HIM.
P. J. Reilly's White and Brindle Dog
Ran Brilliantly Throughout
Many Rounds of Great
Coursing.
Warship, a white and brindle dog, \
proved ih> surprise ;<t Union Coursing I
Park yesterday, winning the open stake
in dashing style. When betting com
menced in the long odds book on Saturday :
any person desiring to back the dog could
have written his own ticket. He won his !
course with Newsboy on Saturday, and
the odds on him to win the stake were 50
to I. As an indication of how lightly lie
was held by the betting men the odds
were 10 to l that Young America would
beat him in his first start yesterday.
Warship defeated Young America and
finally worked his way into the all-im
portant final. There he met Benieia Boy.
The dogs were slipped to a fast bare,
which twisted and turned in the fleld
near the bench. In one of the quick
turns, after Warship seemed to have the
stake at his mercy, he slipped and rolled
over several times. He acted as though
dazed for v moment, hut pluckily went In
pursuit of his Kan:.-. Benieia Boy was
running up points all this time and the
spectators thought he could not i"Se.
"Warship finally pot the hare, which
proved a clinker, and soon had the score
a tie. The hare lasted just long enough
for him to overcome the lead 01 Benicie
Boy and win.
The sport throughout the day was good,
although some of the besi dogs were
held out for next Sunday for the ladies'
day champion stake, one of the classic
coursing events of the year.
Judge Bull was apblauded during the
second round when he declared it "no
course" between Prince Hal and Law
rence. The former, which was the favor
ite, goi away from the slips some lengths
in the lead. He won both times.
Mr. Hanrahan of Sacramento was pres
ent to see his dog Mercury K n through the
stake. He was defeated In the last round.

1 ALAMEDA, June 11. -The payment of a
Mil of $ls to School Census Marshal Hal
lentine for extra work in connection with
taking the last school census promises to
Plunge the members of the Alameda
Board of Education into a row that will
rival In severity the recent scrimmage be
tween the- City Trustees and Clerk Lam
born.
>. consisting of
Directors Otis and Sloan, reported ad
versely on the claim at the last meeting
df the board. Directors Brown and Keys
favored the payment of it, and Chairman
beott. who had hitherto been affiliated
with Otis and Sloan, deserted them at the
trying moment and voted to pay Ballen
tine. The argument was heated and the
chagrin of Otis and Sloan on being over
ruled in their judgment as to the legality
of the claim was plainly evident.
The warrant was drawn, but before Bal
lentine could present it to County Superin
tendent Crawford Mr. Otis blocked the
payment by serving notice on Mr. Craw
ford that tne ciaim was illegal and would
be contested in the courts if necessary.
President Scott is not inclined to take
kindly to Mr. Otis' action and threatens
to "kick over the traces' when the board
meets next Tuesday nighl to elect teach
ers for the ensuing year.
On the other hand Mr. Sloan, who is
credited with a desire tv do politics, is in
a position to punish the chairman for
casting his vote against the finance com
mittee's report on the lentine bill. In
cidentally a number of teachers whose
tenure of office has been hanging by a
thread may be saved through the discord
that has sprung up over the Census Mar
?hal's disputed claim.
President Scott has advocated the re
moval of nearly every principal in the de
partment and the employment of new
blnod. Directors Otis and Sloan, it is
stated had reached an understanding
with him to carry his plans into execu
tion, but since he fell down on the propo
sition to reject the annoying claim of Bal
lentine it is hinted that they will with
draw from any nation to bring about
a wholesale decapitation of teachers.
"I do not think the caucus programme
will ko through now." said Director Cy
rus Brown. "Many things have occurred
since the caucus that will result in the
members of the board acting with inde
pendence. I do not think that they are a
unit on anything at the present time, and
I do not believe that th > wholesale slaugh
ter of teachers which was to take place
Tuesday nifcht will come about. There
may be some change?, but I have no idea
that thpy will be as sweeping as was at
first inu-nded."

RELIEF FOR THE
MAN WITH THE HOE.
At Howard Street Methodist Episcopal
Church last night the pastor, Rev. Dr.
John A. B. Wilson, spoke on "How the
Man With the Hoe May Obtain the Re
lief Provided." The text was Matthew
xii:2B-29. In part he said:
The man with the hoe represents the victim
of our Hl-adjusted economic conditions, which
bestow upon one class a superabundance, de
moralizing by its plethora; ;ir.<l upon another
class a penury that means degeneracy.
In a broader view the man with the hoe
stands for the unrest of life: the despair of
one who toils to no purpose, and finds at the
end of his objective activities subjective dis
appointment. This is the stolid fate that set
tles upon one who peeks rest and finds none.
Whatever the cause in the adjustment of con
ditions, this is the product.
Let me remind you, however, that the need
furnishes the vantage ground of relief. Neces
sity is the Savior's condition of its applica
tion, "Come unto me all ye that labor and
are heavy ladened and I will give you rest."
Every human life is burdened with a "longing
for rest. But. how many are the ways of
securing it? One thinks the cure is the sin
gle tax, and 1 know it would lighten many
burden-; and give to humanity better condi
tions. Another finds In socialistic theories the
agency for redeeming the man with the hoe,
and I shall not deny that a large element of
his theory will enter into the final adjustment
In equity. Another is sure that the temper
ance reformation will bring the millennium,
an*i I admit that the closing of the saloons
and all places where drink is sold would do
more to relieve the miseries of life than any
other one thing reformatory that can be done..
The uplift of society is to be accomplished
through the impartation of new principles of
a better life to the units of society. And this
is done only by contact, yea, by the lmparta
tlon of a better life, and that opportunity is
Jound in "Come unto me all ye that labor
and are heavy ladened and 1 will give you
rest." He gives rest not on the Christmas tree
plan, but by removing the cause of unrest. i
DR. LOCKE'S DISCOURSE
ON HOW TO BE HAPPY
Rev. Charles Edward Locke addressed
gregation in Metropolitan
Temple last night on the "Bright Side of
Things, or Huw to Be Happy." In part
Faith, hope, charity, these three, but the
greatest of these is charity, because it ad
just? us to our fellow men in one vast brother
hood; faith comes first, because it relates us
to our heavenly Father, and to seek first
the kingdom of God and His righteousness
must take priority over all other duties. The
second of this triumvirate of manly virtues
is hope; it is subjective; it -has to do with
thfi inner life of the individual; it Is a kind
of storage battery, indispenbable to the move
ments and progress and happiness of man.
Paul uses another figure when he strikingly
refers to hepe as "an anchor of the soul,
both sure and steadfast," which, in the wild
storms on life's billowy sea, preserves our
frail barks from destruction.
There is a bright side of things, and it is
the factorship of hope to find the bright Fide,
to dwell among the bright things, to preach
the gospc-1 of the light, to rejoice evermore
and to keep this old earth ringing with glad
dest music.
Yes, there is a bright side: it Is the right
Bide; the faifh side; the love side; the cross
side; the heaven side; the Christ side; the
hope side. A recent advertisement reads as
follows: "In the cheering-up business. A
lady who has had successful experience will
read to, or amuse invalids or convalescents."
Good. Humanity around us is sick, let us
so into the cheering-up business! Do not
worry; It doesn't pay; it takes the music out
of the lyre, the song out of the soul! Re
member, "The mill will never grind with the
water that has passed " Let us strive to util
ize our opportunities as they come, but mor
bid dwelling upon past shortcomings will but
and to our sin and dismay by the wasting of
the present. We must not be too much elated
by earth's successes that we may not be over
whelmed by our failures. Let us do our best
and trust God. No matter what may befall
us i rod i: not ad.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, JUNE 12, 1899.
CLEVER ACTRESS WITH
THE FROHMAN COMPANY
MISS MARGARET ANGLIN,
MISS MARGARET ANGLIN' is one of the bright particular stars in *3
the strong aggregation of players which has been gathered to-
gether by Charles Frohman to support Henry Miller in the latest g
popular successes at the Columbia Theater for a season of ten <^
weeks. Miss Anglin will make her first appearance this evening as q
Lady Jessica in "The Liars." and according to those who have witnessed her *â¢
performances she will make an emphatic bit. 0
Miss Anglin rose into sudden prominence last October immediately after S3
the first performance of "Cyrano de Bergerac" at the Garden Theater, New â¢0?
York. Unknown and unheralded she had been cast for Roxane, and she *?
conquered every one by the sheer force of ability and personality. Her ex- 0
perience, however, had fitted her for a high class of work and for a promt- i*
nent position before the footlights. Â£
She is a Canadian by birth and the daughter of an ex-Speaker of the JÂ«j
Dominion Parliament. After receiving her education at a French convent O
she determined to study for the stage. A course at an Eastern dramatic â¢?
school was followed by her first appearance in a small part in "Shenan- Â£
doah." under the management of Charles Frohman. at the Academy of Mv- J3
sic, New York, in the season of 1594-5. Since that time she has been contln- H
uously before the public. . ,%

Woodmen of the World of San Francisco,
Alameda and Santa Clara Counties, with
their relatives and friends. Upon reach-
Ing the grounds in the wlldwoods the L9(Jo
persons formed into parties and distrib
uted themselves wherever each supposed
waa "the most beautiful spot on the
grounds" and enjoyed lunch, after which
there was dancing in the large pavilion.
In the afternoon there were races on
the Olympic track, with the following re
sults:
Boys under 12 yearsâ Royal Boyd first; Earl

for a pair of corsets
Another event was a Cakewalk by four

a log sixty inches in circumference, mak
ing a twenty-inch cut. The prize was
awarded to R. M. Smith and W. M. Mus
ser, who made the cut in 1 minute 12

ness in allowing the society the use of
classrooms. The presentation to M. Eu
gene Legalist, treasurer of the alliance,
with a silver medal by the Home Society
at Paris caused an outburst of applause.

"Star Spangled Banner" by eleven little
girls. The pupils of the Denman class at

ing from tuberculosis. He is confident he

STILL THERE'S
A CHANCE FOR
COMPROMISE
Minority Will Meet
To-Day.
MAY REACH AN AGREEMENT
SUPERVISORS WILL HOLD A SES
SION ANYWAY.
They Will Not Act Finally on the
Franchises and They Will Pass
on City Gas Bills
Only.
There will be one more chance for the
c; ( s companies and the Mayor and the
minority of the Board of Supervisors
to come to an agreement. The tin 1 ..'
for th>- meeting "f the board is '.his
afternoon, but before it meets, prob
ably this morning, the minority and the
Mayor will hold another conference,
similar to the one < : Friday, and it may
be thai the vexing question >f gas will
be settled then. In cafe it be settled
Mayor will call the meeting of ci:o
moon .and the Supervisors can,
without taint of possible illegality, get
down to their neglected business.
At Friday's meeting, although the
Mayor ami the representatives of the
gas company parted friendly enemies,
still they had been very near an
agreement on rates, and a little give
Ââ¢ or either side this morning may
bring about the much wished for com
promise, for the companies need the
money and there is n*' doubt but :he
the Supervisors are taking in let
business go to the dogs may lead
1.0 Berious harm. At the meeting Fri
day there was represented only she Pa-
Gas Improvement Company, but
the minority has been given to under
stand that if the Pacific people come
â¢..i an arrangement at all satisfactory.
the San Francisco Company will join
with it so as to avoid further trouble.
It is the companies' money against i>\ -
< ity's business, and both sides are
anxious for some solution of the
problem.
Th<. ultimatum of the majority was
that the city bills in the hands of the
Pacific company and the rates it
charged consumers should be consider
ed together, and then, later, that no
proposition from a single company
would he heard. The companies are
still urging that th-- consumers' rates
are the BUbjeci of a suit in court, and
should be left for the court's decision,
'hat it will be urged again to-day
if the companies are represented be
fore this morning's meeting of the
minority. Should no decision be reach
ed the Mayor still declares he will not
call a meeting.
There will be a meeting of the ma
jority this afternoon, held under the
resolution passed on January 3 of this
year, the resolution setting each Mon
day as the time for the regular meet-
Ings of the board. The full majority
will be there, and if the Mayor does
not call the meeting there will be three
"T four of the minority present despite
that fact. They will' take a hand in
su<h business as can be transacted
without interfering with the positions
they have assumed en the franchises
and the gas. rates.
As to the franchises, the members of
thÂ»' majority repeat the statement that
there will be no final action taken, even
if the whole board meets. The fran
â  hises will be brought up, and any one
who wishes to talk will be heard, either
in protest or in support, and then they
will positively be referred back to the
Street Committee, there to await the
pleasure of the board.
Should there be no agreement at the
meeting of the minority and the gas j
people the majority will take action on !
the bills owed by the city, but con- j
sumerp' rates will not be considered.
These will be left to the courts or to
BOrne future action of the board.
ELOQUENCE AND SPECIAL
MUSIC AT ST. MARY'S
Special music was a feature at the 11
o'clock Mass at St. Marys (Paultsts) yes
terday morning. Dennis O'Sulllvan sang.
During the Mass Father Wyman
preached from the v- x t: "From whence
can any one till them with bread," St.
Mark. viii:4. In part he said:
Men are nowadays looking to the religion of
Christ and asking a question like this one
â which the disciples put to our Lord in the wil
derness. At the close of this nineteenth cen
tury we behold a religious wilderness, in the
midst at a world filled with eater and ambi
tious men. An area of civilization now extends
to every ocean, but perhaps since the establish
ment of Christianity among the nations there
has not been a greater stiirltua.l destitution
than we find in some regions to-day. Men are
all around us hungering and thirsting after
truth and happiness and know not where to
'obtain it. The rellelous denominations in
which they were reared are breaking up and
they find themselves In a wilderness of doubt
and unbelief. Convictions that a few genera
tions ago swayed Whole nations and peoples
are now found wanting, have to be altered or
abandoned, and In this disruption and confu
sion of creeds the world Is strewed with reli
gious wrecks and no relief seems to them to
be at hand.
But there is a remedy for these poor souls
as there was for the starving multitude In th-Â»
wilderness, in the religion founded by Him
â¢who filled the hungry multitude in the wilder
ness. There is. I say, a faith which defies
the closest historical scrutiny; a faith of which
we to-day can Fay as St. Irenaeus of the sec
ond century said to the doubters of his day
"Where the church Is. he tells us, the spirit
of Ood Is, and where the spirit of God If the.
church is also." He refers his opponents to
the doctrine and discipline of the apostles with
as much knowledge and certainty as a Con
gressman of to-day would refer to the princi
ples of Washington or Jefferson.
In view of this testimony and other evidence
equally strong. Professor Fisher of Yale Uni
versity, one of the greatest historians of to-day,
says, "In the middle of the second century
membership in the , one visible Catholic church
Â»-a.Â« considered essential to salvation."
Had Christ not satisfied the religious yearn
ings of his hearers his church would never have
risen up In a pagan world and have supple
mented worldiness and Idolatry. In past ages
people have found their fill of spiritual food
and those who are still faithful to the same
doctrines are satisfied.
I do not believe that the Lord who had such
compassion on men suffering from bodily hun
ger does not have the pity to-day upon those
â¢whose souls are starved for this good shep
herd coes out to find the one sheen who is
lost. May we not believe that in His mercy
he will lead every sincere soul desiring divine
shelter into the one true fold.
GOAT ISLAND
IN A BLAZE
Brush and Grass Burn for Several
Hours.
0 fT^HE annual brush fire on Goat Island burst forth in all its lurid splendor O.
shortly before dusk last night. The fire started on the ."outierrv end of
the island near the torpedo station and worked its way toward the JT
O A north shore. Aside from the scorching of telephone and telegraph poles
# no damage was done. The lighthouse tender McDonough, assisted by the 0
rt pumping works on the island, poured Rtr<ams of water on all the buildings
Z. Bimply as a safeguard against sparks from the burning brush. Â£
Viewed from passing ferry-boats the fire had a particularly spectacular ef- W
'â & feet and nearly all the passengers crowded to the island side of the steamer Â£
n to feast their eyes on the sight.

FILTHY "TURTLE."
BY ASHTON STEVENS.
I WOULDN'T take Little Egypt to
see "The Turtle," the filthy Fi*ench
farce that was exposed In the Cali
fornia Theater last night. It is the
most obscene, brutal spectacle that
I have ever witnessed in a licensed
theater, and any woman who intends
sitting it out would better paint her
features a hot, red blush.
There art. some shows of a risky na
ture that call for nothing stronger than
a frivolous rebuke in the columns jf the
press. Sometimes these shows make
very good reading in the next day's
newspapers. They are suggestive, but
clever, and often warrant their free
advertisements and prosperity. But
"The Turtle" is of another class, of a
class of its own, so far as my experi
ence goes, and needs the attention of
the Police and Health departments.
Vulgar does not describe it. You
simply cannot describe it and be fit to
print. It is one orgy of nightgowns,
pajamas and beds and physical and
verbal nastiness.
The principal woman of the company
is instructed by the author and hired
by the management to all but unskin
herself in sight of the audience. The
details of this disrobing act. that are
not presented to you point blank are re
vealed by a carefully arranged system
of mirrors. Then the lady flops into
the nuptial couch, which is in full view,
and the farce goes on.
The most of the lines, situations and
gesticular insinuations are beyond
credence in a civilized community. In
both writing and acting "The Turtle"
is a deliberate appeal to drunken men
and bawdry women, apd its stench will
linger long In the California Theater.

COURSING WILL
NOT BE RESUMED
AT INGLESIDE
Anti - Betting Order
Will Stand.
SUPERVISORS REMAIN FIRM
WORK ON A NEW PARK WILL
BEGIN AT ONCE.
Capitalists Have Selected a Site for
It Just Across the Line
in San Mate 3
County.
There will be no more coursing at Tn
gleside Park, but work on a new park,
on the line separating San Mateo and
San Francisco counties, will begin within
a fortnight.
A majority of the Supervisors were in
terviewed yesterday as to their attitude
regarding the resumption of coursing at
Ingleside. They all declared they WOUld
not vote to rescind the ordinance passed
by them and which places the sport un- j
der the ban. They will not permit bet- '
ting, and without that adjunct the cours- .
ing of the dogs would bu conducted, If at
all, at a great pecuniary loss.
A number of capitalists, not heretofore
Identified with the sport on this coast.
will commence work on a new park with
in the next fortnight. The site selected |
Is bounded on the north by the county
line, on the west by the railroad, and on
the east by the old Mission or county
road. It is just opposite the pumping sta
tion of the Spring Valley Water
Works, mar Lake Merced. The field is
a large one, giving full scope for the
hares and hounds. George Ehmann, who
promoted coursing at Dlxon, is at the
head of the syndicate having the project
in view.
"There is room for two parks," he said
last night, "and there should be no con- j
I tlict of interests. The capitalists with
; whom I am associated ar.' ready to begin
I operations at once. We are only awaiting ,
j the decision of the Supervisors in the |
' Ingleside matter before putting our mon- ;
ey in the venture. if the Supervisors
: agree to let the gates of [ngleside Park
bf reopened we will take no further steps
â¢; In the premises. We know three parks
could not exist.
"We will wait until after the Supervis
; ors meet on the 19th inst. If they have
i not rescinded the anti-betting ordinance
! by that time we will prepare to open our ,
. park. It will be easily accessible, and, ;
i with the number of greyhounds available
for coursing, we have no fear of a lack
' of patronage."
DOLPHIN SCULLERS
DEFEAT THE OLYMPICS
WIN SENIORAND JUNIOR BARGE
RACES AT BELVEDERE.
An Excellent Programme of Aquatic
Sports Presented by the Oars
men at Their Clubhouse.
The Dolphin and Olympia boat clubs
carried out their programme of aquatic
sports yesterday at Belvedere most suc
cessfully. Though a strong breeze in the
channel raised the whltecaps and caused
the ferry-boats to list nearly five points
to Â£he leeward side, the waters of Tibu
ron Cove were only gently rippled.
Launches and rowboats filled with jolly
parties moved to and fro over the gleam
ing water, and the float and balcony of
the Olympic boathouse were crowded with
well-known oarsmen and their friends.
The programme began soon after noon,
and was carried out without hitch or de
lay. In the junior outrigger skiff mo
tor medals presented by A. \V. Pape and
A. P. Rothkopf there were six entries, but
of these two, J. Hobson and George James
were scratched, leaving four contestants,
who rowed in two heats. Jn the first heat
Victor Caglierl of the Dolphins defeated
H. Cobb of the Olympics, the latter cap
sizing on the way back. In the second
heat George Baker of the Dolphins de
feated Lester Eiammersmith of the same
club, though the latter steered a better
course up to the turn.
The Indian canoe race between Lester
Hammersmith and L. Werz did not
amount to much as a race, though Werz
created a good deal of merriment by the
manner In which he wobbled about In
his cranky craft.
The junior barge race brought out two
Olympic (.tows, and one from the Dol
phins. Th.- Olympic crew, consisting of
J. F. Cunningham, bow; C. Dayis, No. -;
L. Werz, No. ;;; utis Crable, stroke, and
"Doc" l'lynn, cockswain, came in two
lengths ahead of the Dolphins, but it
turned out that, finding themselves hope
lessly beaten, they had not rounded the
siake, but had turned about and started
back before reaching it. This gave tirst
place to the Dolphin crew, made up of W.
Bush, bow; J. Sullivan. NO. 2; T. Baxter,
No. 3; A. H. I'ape, stroke, and E. Bart
man, cockswain, and second place was
taken by 1 1 1 * â¢ Olympic crew, composed of
J. Eiobson, bow; M. Oobb. No. 2; A. Till,
No. 3; H. Herbert, stroke, and P. Kane,
cockswain. In the outrigger skiff race
A. W. I'ape, Pacific Coast champion, gave
"Doc" Fiynn thirty seconds over the
course, and beat him easily. A swimming
race between George Hlnkel and J. J.
Phillips, both of the Olympic Club, re
sulted in a victory for the former, the
distance being about one hundred yards.
The final heat of the outrigger skiff race
for novices of the Ariel Rowing Club was
won easily by Charles Wilson, who early
established a lead over E. Lynch and kept
it to tlie end.
The most interesting and exciting event
of the day was the senior barge race be
tween the Dolphin crewâ composed of
Victor Caglieri, bow; George Baker, No.
2; W. O. Patch. No. 3; A. W. Pape,
stroke, and E. Bartman, cockswainâ and
the Olympic crew, with George James,
bow; P. Sturdlvant. No. 2; W. Cartwright,
No. 3; H. M. Collins, stroke, and P. Kane,
cockswain. The Dolphins rowed neatly
and had more swing than the Olympics,
but the latter, though rough, were strong
and heavy, averaging about 180 rounds per
man. At the turn the Olympics haci a
slight lead, but a keenly contested race
ended In a victory for the Dolphins by
half a length. Near the finish the boats
were so close together that Patch's oar
was broken by collision witn the Olympic
barge, but this did not affect the outcome.
The last event was a tug-of-warin white
halls between Olympic and Dolphin crews.
A. M. Stone and J. Hobson of the Olym
pics, with L. Bullion as anchorman, pulled
A. W. Pape and W. O. Patch of the Dol
phins, with W. Kennedy as anchorman,
across the line and won.
The officials of the day were: A. P.
Rothkopf, starter; J. A. Hammersmith,
referee; Joseph O'Connor, clerk of the
course; John Elliott, timer; W. J. Ken
nedy, A. M. Stone and A. Schuppert,
judges.
Among the well-known oarsmen whose
names did not appear on the programme
may be mentioned Leiinder Stevenson,
William McCausland and S. J. Pembroke.
The two last had an impromptu race
round the course in outrigger skiffs, S. J.
Pembroke proving the faster.
The final heat in the outrigger skiff race
between Victor Caglieri and George Baker
of the Dolphins was not rowed, as Cag
lieri had a hard pull in the senior barge
event. It will be decided over the Dol
phin Club course at an early date. As a
result of yesterday's races the Olympic
Club men will enter a Junior barge crew
at El Campo on June 25. The crew from
the University of California will row in
the Pioneer barge.
Sought Adventures.
The engineer division of the Naval Mili
tia took out a whaleboat yesterday and
sought adventures in the bay off Mission
Rock. Fireman Donellan was cockswain,
and A. G. Qulnlan was in charge of some
of the first division men who went along
as reserves. Off the rock they saw a
â¢Whitehall, manned by two men, capsize.
They made for It, but two Southenders
arrived first and took the men aboard
their boat. They found they could not
mwke much headway, however, with the
extra load, so the whaleboat took the
Southenders 1 boat and the capsized white
hall In tow and landed them all at Long
Wharf. On the way home the whaleboat
fell In with a scow schooner merrily drag
ging her anchor toward Mission Rock.
There was no one on board, so the boat's
crew boarded her and sailed her back to
her anchorage, where they turned her
over to her own crewâ two men who had
j gone on shore for a Sunday drink.
Three Young Burglars.
Joe Muser, Frank Rode] and Toney Goger,
three lads ranging from 10 to 13 years of
age, were arrested last night by Officers
Keyea and Sylvester and booked at the
City Prison on charges of burglary. It is
alleged that the young culprits broke Into
a cigar store at 242 Kllis street and made
oft with a quantity of cigars and tobacco.

J. P. EMERSON SLASHES HIS
TH&OAT.
J. P. Emerson, a retired sea captain of
the British navy, attempted suicide last
night while in the Abbotsford saloon on
Eddy street, by harking His throat with
a razor. Bystanders discovered him in a
back room covered with blood, and noti
fied a. policeman, and he was hurriedly
sent to the Receiving Hospital. The
weapon he used could not be found on
Emerson and the officer went bacÂ« to the
resort to find it. While the ambulance
was hurrying out to the City Hall, Dr.
jM in si â > . who wan seated In front, saw
Ills n::tlent energetically engaged in com
pleting his work. He yelled to Driver
, Peterson to .stop, and when the speeding
'-vehicle was brought to b standstill, he
rushed to the door and sprang in and
fought for the. possession of the razor.

crazed patient; but managed to secure it.
When placed on the operating table
Etueraons' hands had to be held and his
fcf:t pinioned while the doctors sewed up
two [aping wounds. Had the razor been
sharper he might have succeeded in his
attempt at destruction, but as it was not,
he will recover. This is the second time
Emerson has tried to end his life. When
ever ho imbibes too freely and becomes
despondent he mediates suicide and
causes no end of trouble to friends and
those around him. He is about 70 wars
old.

Reincarnation
â¢ Universal Brotherhood Lodge of Theos
ophlsts held Its regular meeting at the
Academy of Science last evening. a large
audience assembled to hear the subject
of "Reincarnation" ably discussed by M.
P. Christiansen , Miss Day and Dr. An
derson. The speakers dwelt on the sub-
Jed that it was the soul which reincar
nated and which came up from the lower
kingdoms to man; that reincarnation is
taught in all Bibles; that as we -are here
now "we must have been here on earth
before â  and that we will be lier.e again.
One speaker said that Jim Jeffries is an
Old gladiator fighting other old gladiators,
as he must have done in the past, and
the Interest which we show to-day in
these contests proves that we might
have been the egos of Romans. A num
b( r of Interesting questions were present
ed by people in the audience, which were
answered by the members of the lodge.
Alfred Splnks acted as chairman and
Henry S. Calm stated the objects of the
Universal Brotherhood organization - and
read a portion of the constitution.
st t ,re. fired a pistol in the air. thinking to
the men away. At that Instant
Landsmann, who had i losed In on True
worthy, fell to the ground, crying out:
"My God, he has stabbed me."
Landsmann was carried to the corner
of Filbert and Laguna Btreets, where he
expired in a few minutes.
Trueworthy disappeared from the scene,
luit the knife and a coat and cap which
belonged to Landsraann were picked up
by Sergeant Anderson near the scene of
the struggle.
Trueworthy is employed by the >
Range Dairy as a driver of a milk wagon
and is a hard character. Monahan
claims that Marsh cut him in the jaw.
When Trueworthy was brought to the
Central Station he gave this version of
the affair:
"I went with Bush at -the latter's re
quest to help him in some, trouble with
two other men. who immediate- jumped
on me and kicked me in the face. Just
then Jimmy Monahan passed me an open
knife, but I don't know whether I cut
anybody or not."
Landsmann was a shipmate of Sampson
and had been working ior Louis Wise
mann for six months. His employer
speaks highly -of him and-savs that he
was quiet and inoffensive, although prone
to drink to excess at times. Sampson
came to this city on the British shin Mi!
tonburn last January and has been em
ployed by Fred Wisemann since then.
Marsh's father is employed as a gripman
on the Unton street line.

VAINLY TRIES TO KILL "JERRY"
JtURPHY.
A Heated Dispute Over the Recent
Prize Fight Leads to a Vi
cious Attempt to
Murder.
â¦
During a heated dispute over the r< la
i tive merits of Jeffries and Fltzsimmons j
! last night Edward O'Donnell, a laborer,
fired two shots at "Jerry" Murphy, who
arrived here two weeks ago from Boston.
Tli" shooting occurred in the saloon at
Sixth and Folsom streets, and notwith- |
standing that O'Donnell was within three i
feet of Murphy when h<- opened tire on j
him, there was no blood shed.
According to Murphy, who is a giant in j
size, he entered the saloon and asked
O'Donnell, who was leaning against the
; bar. to join him in a drink. O'Donnell
was under the influence of liquor and
seemed to be spoiling for a fight. After
sizing up Murphy lie referred to him as
a "big dub" and dared him to "put up
; his props."
"You remind me of Jeffries," he re- j
â  marked in an insulting manner. "Fitz ;
i can put it all over him."
Murphy replied that Jeffries had fairly
! beaten Fitz and defied O'Donnell to prove
otherwise.
"You call me a liar, do you?" roared
O'Donnell, picking up a bottle which was
I on the counter and bringing it down on
his adversary's head, inflicting a slight !
v i â mill.
Murphy, although partly dazed by the
blow, Btarted to seize his brutal assailant
wh'-n the latter dr. w a revolver and tired
two shots at him. O'Donnell was within
a few feet of his intended victim, and
j how the bullets missed striking Murphy
I is a mystery.
As O'Donnell raised his revolver to fire
1 the third shot the bartender grabbed him
; and after a short struggle succeeded in
disarming him.
Several police officers who had been at
tracted to the saloon by the shooting
promptly arrested O'Donnell and started
with him for the City Prison. On the
way the infuriated num. although hand
cuffed, made a vigorous resistance and i
it was found necessary to club him into !
submission. At the prison he was for
mally charged with an assault to commit :
murder.

MYSTERIOUS DEATH OF
AN AGED STRANGER
Two Men Taken Into Custody
on Suspicion of Having
Clubbed Him.
THE police are puzzled over the mys
terious death of an unknown man,
who expired in a saloon at 635 Clay
street yesterday morning. At first
it was thought that his death was due to
heart failure, but later developments con
vinced the police that he was the victim
of foul play. I-ast evening Sergeant
Christiansen and Policeman Conroy, evi
dently satisfied that the unfortunate
man's death was caused by violence, ar

THE UNKNOWN DEAD.

EASE HIS PAIN
Suicide of Despondent
Herman Webber.
GAS WAS HIS LAST REFUGE
â¦
HE HAD BEEN SICK AND WAS
TIRED OF LIFE.
Through a Shower Bath Hose He
haled the Deadly Fluid.
Found Seated on the
Bathtub.
Tired of a life of sickness and pain, Her
man Webber committed suicide In his
home yesterday. He chose the gas
method, and although he left no word it
was evident the unfortunate man had
taken his own life.
Webber resided at Si'? 1 ;. Folsom street.
He has been afflicted with stomach
trouble for some time and latterly it has
grown upon him until he was almost con
stantly in pain. He grew mere and more
despondent and remedies failed to help
him, but he gave no intimation that he
was planning to end his sufferings in self
destruction.
He took a short walk yesterday morning
after he had risen from bed, and as soon
as he came in he went direct to the bath
room. There he was found some hours
afterward by his wife. She had detected
a strong odor of gas in the ljall outside
the br.throom door, and forcing her way
into the room she found her- husband sit
ting on the side of the tub. He was dead.
He had taken the hose from the supply |
pipe of the shower bath and this he had j
fastened to the gas jet. The other end
he had led to his mouth and it was still
clenched between his teeth when he was
found.
Hi was immediately taken into another
room and every effort to revive him was
made, but he was beyond. recovery when '
he was found. The Coroner's office was !
notified and Deputy Gately went out to
investigate. It was so evidently a case i
of suicide that upon the request of the
suicide's relatives the body was not re
moved to the Morgue.
Webber was a native of Germany. He
was 47 years old and leaves a widow and
four children, two boys and two girls.
NORDDEUTSCHER VEREIN.
The annual picnic and summer night
festival of the Xnrddeutscher Verein at '
Shell Mound Park yesterday was an em- '
phatlc success.
Over a thousand people journeyed
across the bay and enjoyment was tht;
order from morning until nearly mid- I
night.
Dancing in the big pavilion formed the '
principal attraction, though the various
amusements on the grounds came in for
their share of attention. The wheel of
fortune distributed many valuable prizes
to holders of lucky numbers, and four
hundred little ones were made happy I
with as many boxes of candy.
The following committees had the affair
In charge and worked tirelessly to insure I
the comfort and pleasure of their guests:

I the tanks. They will be held pending
further investigation.
A peculiar weapon, resembling a "black
jack," was booked as evidence against the
pair.
According to the bartender's story the
supposed victim walked into the saloon
and called for a drink. He was under the
influence of liquor and was in an ugly
| mood. Chamberlain was in the place at
| the time and accepted an invitation from
the stranger to join him in a drink. After
i having several drinks the unknown man
suddenly threw up his hands and fell to
the floor. In a few seconds he was dead.
Revalah emphatically denies that he
struck the stranger. He declares that
j after the man expired he ordered Cham
berlain to notify the Coroner. After con
siderable questioning he admitted that
the weapon which Is in the possession of
the police was his property.
He, however, claims that he used it in
cleaning the lamps in the saloon. At
tached to one end of the weapon is - a
bunch of rags which shows evidence of
having come in contact with kerosene,
partly bearing out Revalah's story of
why he had it in his possession.
Chamberlain refuses to discuss the sup-
I posed murder, except to say that he is
innocent of any' wrong-doing. To Ser
geant Christiansen he admitted having
had several drinks with the unknown vic
tim, but persistently denied that either
he or the bartender struck him. To-day
an autopsy will be held on the body and
;it will then be definitely ascertained
whether or not the stranger died from
heart failure or was the victim of foul
i pla y.
After he breathed his last a letter
! signed "Henderson" dropped out of his
; coal pocket. It read that the writer had
I been kicked out of the Almshouse and
threatening to bring the matter to the at
tention of the authorities. In another
pocket was found a piece of paper, on
which was written some doggerel verses.
Under the concluding verse was the name
"Harris."
The man was about sixty years of age,
had bushy gray whiskers and was shab

THOMAS KELLY
IS IN TROUBLE
ONCE AGAIN
The Special Under a
Serious Charge.
TOO READY WITH HIS GUN
NOW CHARGED WITH ASSAULT
WITH A DEADLY WEAPON.
Accused of Having Used Vile and In
sulting Terms and Drawing His
Gun When They Were
Resented.
â â¦ â
Special Officer Thomas Kelly, who at
tim<-s watches residences in the Western
Addition, is again in trouble. This time
he is charged with assault with a deadly
weapon on Ed Ritau, proprietor of a res
taurant at Broadway and Montgom
ery avenue.
The story of the trouble as related by
one qt the eyewitnesses is that Kelly at
tended a dance Saturday night in Gari
baldi Hall and partook a trifle too freely
of the cup that cheers. At about 4 o'clock
Sunday morning he made his appearance
in a saloon on Montgnmi-ry avenue, near
Broadway. A crowd of men were stand
ing before the bar drinking, and Kelly
thrust himself into the crowd. He an
nounced himself ;is a deputy United
States marshal, and addressed the men
with the vilest and most insulting epi
thets at his command.
Ritau took the matter personally and
resented the insult. A general mJx-up
followed, and Kelly, finding- that he way
getting the worst of it. drew his revolver
and aimed it at Kitau's breast. Before
he could pull the trigger Henry Steward,
who is employed in Frank & Paul's danco
hall on Broadway, wrested the weapon
from his hand. The combatants had by
this time worked their way from the
saloon into the street, and the disarmed
special was in imminent danger of being
seriously injured by the maddened crowd
when the police put in their appearance
and put a stop to the trouble by arresting
Kelly. He was taken to the" California
street police station, but as he wore thÂ«*
star of a special Corporal Burke declined
to book him and had him sent directly to
the Central station.
Kelly and his friends tell a story alto
gether at variance with this one. They
claim that he went into the saloon anil
challenged any and all comers to a wrest
ling match. The proprietor of the saloon
refused to allow it to take place indoors
and Kelly and his opponent withdrew to
the sidewalk During the wrestling match
the revolver fell from Kelly's pocket and
at the same time Officer Brodt arrived aj d
placed the special officer under arrest
Kelly has the reputation of being a bad
man when under the influence of ltmior
and this is the third time he has found
himself in serious trouble. Captain Witt
man is making a thorough investigation
of the case, and the probabilities are that
Kelly will not only lose his star but be
forced to pay n penalty for being too
ready with his gun.

OUT OF A PARACHUTE
DANIEL MALONEY SEBIOUSLY
INJURED IN GLEN PARK.
A Sudden Lurch of the Big Balloon
Throws the Aeronaut From His
Perch on the Trapeze.
Daniel Maloney, the aeronaut, who was
programmed to make an ascent in the
balloon In Glen Park yesterday afternoon,
met with a serious accident which neces
sitated his removal to St. Luke's Hos
pital, where Dr. Herbert G. Shaw, the
house surgeon, dressed his wounds.
Maloney was seated in the parachute
aS the time the balloon had been Inflated,
! and just as the men having charge of the
i guy ropes were about to cut it loose a
! sudden gust of wind struck the balloon
: and brought it up taut against the stay
rcpes. The sudden jerk on the line which
: held the parachute dislodged Maloney
! from his seat on the ttapeze bar and Bent
I him to earth, a distance of about thirty
'â  feet. In the meantime the balloon was
I cut free and soared off in an easterly dl
! rection. landing in Mission Bay, off
Hunters Point.
Superintendent Hairy 1. McGill of Glen
<Park at once went to the aid of the fallen
and injured aeronaut and had him con
veyed to St. Luke's Hospital.
On his arrival at the hospital Dr. Shaw
made an examination of his injuries and
found that he received a lacerated wound
oi the chin, which required ten stitches
t<; close, besides this there was a rib
broken, his chest was crushed and severe
ly injured, and a contused wound of the
right thigh was also inflicted.
After having his wounds dressed Ma
loney was put to bed and made as com
fortable as was possible. Dr. Shaw is of
tin opinion that there are no serious In
ternal injuries by which thr life of Ma
in. py may be endangered. He received a
bad shaking up. and it will be some time
before he will be in a position to again
take a flyer from the trapeze bar to moth
er earth.
