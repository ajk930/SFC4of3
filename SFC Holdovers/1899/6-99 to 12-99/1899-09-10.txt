DREYFUS IS CONVICTED
BY THE COURT-MARTIAL
Unjust Verdict Rendered by the
Military Tribunal at Rennes,
Finding the Accused Guilty of
Treason as Charged.
Counsel for the Persecuted Captain Will Appeal
From the Judgment, Claiming That if Al
lowed to Stand It Will Make the Existence
of Hebrews in France Impossible.
7DBNNES,Sept Q.âThe ex
-Lv pected lias happened. Drey
fus h-as been condemned, but though
a majority of those in the court
room this afternoon fully expected
the verdict, they were completely j
stupefied when it was given, and the j
ice which prevailed in the room
and the way men turned pale and
caught their breath was more im
pressive than a>iy other manifesta
tion could have been.
Mai! re Demange sank back in
his chair and tears trickled down
Jiis checks, and Maitre Labori
turned white as a sheet, while all
around the court men looked at each
other in silence. Positively the only
sound to be heard was the rustling
of papers from the reporters'
tenches as each press representative
tried to be first to send the news.
As the audience left the court
room fully ten or fifteen men were
crying openly, and the majority of
those present walked quietly down
the street for more than a block
without speaking a word. It was
like a funeral procession.
Meanwhile a tragedy was being
enacted in the little room off the
courtroom, where Dreyfus listetied
to the reading of the verdict. He
had been told by his lawyers and
had wept bitterly, but when in the
presence of the otficials of the
court-martial he listened impas
sively to the sentence.
His wife. who was waiting in tor
ture and suspense at her house,
bore the news bravely, and when
visiting her husband this afternoon
she showed the onlookers who wer t
in the streets no signs of her suf
ferings as she walked from her car
riage to the prison.
'Mathieu Dreyfus was not pres
ent in court this afternoon, but vis
ited his brother after the verdict
had been rendered. He found him
perfectly calm and without any
manifestation of surprise at the
finding of the court. The prisoner
simply shrugged his shoulders, ut
tering an expressive "Bah!" add
in", as he embraced his brother as
tlie' latter was preparing to leave,
"Console my wife."
The general belief is that Drey
fus will be pardoned, but this will
not satisfy his friends, who
vehemently declare that they will\

refuse to accept the verdict and will '
continue the battle until the judg
ment is reversed. The verdict, they
say, is directed more against tlie
Jews than against Dreyfus, and
if allowed to stand will make their
existence in France impossible.
Maitre Labori and Maitre De- \
mange took the midnight train for
Paris. They drove to the station in
a closed carriage, escorted by four ;
mounted gendarmes. The road was
practically deserted, and no demon- \
stratum occurred on the route or at
the station.
Maitre Demange and Maitre
Labori will to-morrow sign an ap
plication for a revision of the case,
although there is no hope that the
verdict will be reversed. Both men
are much upset, though it can
hardly be said that they are sur
prised.
CLAMOR AT RENNES
CAUSES LIVELY RIOTS
ftENNES, Sept. 9.â Scenes of great
excitement occurred at Rennes to
night. The anti-Dreyfusards broke
loose and started a demonstratlpn
which, but for prompt and rigorous
measures by the police, would un
doubtedly have developed into serious
disorders.
SENTENCE MAY BE SHORTENED
TO A FORTNIGHT.
RENNES, Sept. 9 âIt is stated here this evening that as Drey
fus has been condemned to ten years' detention, and as he has al
ready suffered Hve years' solitary imprisonment, which counts as
double the ordinary detention, he will be released at the end of a
fortnight. In the meanwhile, unless the President of the republic
pardons him, which many think certain as being the only solu
tion to the present situation, Dreyfus will have to be degraded here
again within eight days.
SAN FRANCISCO, SUNDAY. SEPTEMBER 10, 1899-THIRTY-TWO PAGES.
The first sign of trouble manifested
Itself Immediately after the verdict be
ep, me known. The streets leading to
the Lycee were at that time filled with
crowds of people awaiting news from
tho courtroom. The announcement of
the prisoner's condemnation was atrrfi-
able to a majority of these and cheers
and cries of "Vive l'armee!" were
raised, the gendarmes and troops look
ing on without any attempt at inter-
ferenre.
The terrace in front of the Cafe de la
Paix, the leading cafe in Rennes. was
filled with the people taking their aft.r
noon drinks and aparients. When the
verdict of the court was announced the
customers arose to their feet and de
manded that the .string band which
I lays on the terrace should give the
"Marseillaise. " The band struck up
the air and the crowds, both inside and
outside, joined in the national song.
Colonel Jouaust passed by a little
later <>n foot and in full uniform on
his way from the Lycee to his home.
The crowd, with bared heads, cheered
him, crying:, "Vive l'armee!" Colonel
Jouaust, in reply to their cheers, sa
luted with his hand to his kepi.
Aa diniitr time approached the streets
became empty, but about 8 o'clock the
crowds again gathered at the Cafe de
la Paix and in the square beside it and
the adjacent street.
Just then an incident occurred at the
Hotel Moderne. which is known as the
Dreyfusard center. Two men. notori
ous anti-Dreyfusards, entered the win
ter garden, inside the garden, and sat
down at one of the little marble tables
under the palm tn-cs and ordered eof-

other Dreyfusanls.
The two newcomers at once began to
make offensive remarks about Dreyfus
and Jews generally. One of them,
turning to "La Dame Blanche." said:
"Oh, these dirty Jews! These dirty
Dreyfusards!"
"I,a Dame Blanche" replied, telling
him not to :i<Hr.'Ps her. The men. how
ever, persisted and added personal in

on the point of breaking out a detach- i
ment of gendarmes arrived, and, after
a Bcene of Intense excitement, put the â 
men who had caused th-j disturbance
into the street. This, however, was
but the beginning. The men proceeded
to the terrace of the Cafe de la Paix,
which was now crammed with anti-
Dreyfusurds, and there grave their own
version of the row, and in a few mo
ments an anti-Dreyfusard demonstra
tion was in full swing. The people sit
ting at the tables rose with shouts of
"Down with the Jews!" and "Vive
l'Armee!" and demanded that the band
play the "Marseillaise." The band was I
obliged to comply with the demand and
the crowd bawled the "Marseillaise"
at the top of their voices, altering the
words to "March on, march on against
the Jews."
Sticks, canes and hats were waved !
and then the crowd chanted "Vive j
l'Armee. vive I'Armee, conspuez les
Juifs." Finally one man waved his hat J
and shouted: "Let us march on the
Hotel Moderne." The crowd showed I
a strong disposition to follow this ad- j
vice, and as the hotel is within 100 I
yards of the cafe the situation began j
to look ugly. Two Englishmen who
were sitting in the cafe were recognized ;
as foreigners and the crowd hustled
them out. At this moment the cry
"Police!" was raised, and an instant )
later a strong body of gendarmes and '
police, headed by detectives, rushed
Into the cafe and cleared every one out,
demonstrators or not. At the same
time several squadrons of mounted gen
darmes and dragoons, with carbines
slung across their backs, galloped up
and threw themselves across the road
leading to the Hotel Moderno. Other
detachments of cavalry cordoned all the
approaches to the cafe and then grad
ually dosed in on the crowd, which was
now large and extremely threatening,
and drove it across the bridge, over I
the river and into the upper part of
the town, which was filled with shouts
of "Vive l'Armee" and "Down with the ;
Jews."
A number of the most noisy of the
demonstrators were arrested, and the
cavalry, at a quick trot, broke up every
group and forced the participants in the
demonstration out of the center of the
town around which was formed a cor
don through which no one was allowed
except he was provided with a pass
from the police authorities.
The demonstration dwindled from
this time until 11:30 o'clock this even
ing, when only a few noisy bands were
left parading the smaller streets, but
running at the first sight of a man in
blue.
Strong repressive measures, however,
alone can prevent serious disturbances.
The cafes in the neighborhood have
been closed, some by the police and
others through panic, and tranquillity
is now practically restored, though to
night's trouble may be only the pre
lude to a bigger demonstration to
morrow.
LEGAL ASPECT OF
THE DREYFUS CASE
PARIS, Sept. 9.â What is the legal
aspect of the case of Captain Dreyfus?
Continued on Second Page.
SCHOOL DIRECTOR GEDGE
ADMITS HE WAS BRIBED
He Was Paid Two Thousand Dollars to Allow a
Stationery Firm to Alter Specifications and
Thus Bar Competition*
His Colleague, J, J. Conlon, He Asserts, Received Eight Hundred
Dollars as His Share for the Qooked Transaction*
THE TWO SCHOOL DIRECTORS WHO ARE ALLEGED TO HAVE ACCEPTED BRIBES.
THERE are members on the San
Francisco School Board who are
not honest. There are men di
recting the educational depart
ment of the city who have ad
mitted that they accepted bribes to
steer contracts in the direction of the
bribe-givers. In one case the specifica
tions unon which bids were invited to
furnish the school supplies were so al
tered at the request of one of the bid
di ra that he could secure the contract
at his own figures. Money was paid to
members of the Board of Education for
that privilege.
Hints, vague assertions and rumors
to this effect have been in the air since
the school supply contracts were
awarded. To-day The Call is in posses
sion of positive proof that all these
rumors are based on absolute facts.
This paper is in a position to prove that
Dr. H. E. Gedge, chairman of the Com
mittee on Supplies, has admitted to at
least one reputable citizen that he re
ceived $2000 from the agent of one of
the bidders for betraying the people
and allowing the firm to Inspect the
specifications and make alterations
that virtually gove it a cinch en secur
ing the contract at its own figures.
More than this. Dr. Gedge has admitted
that $SOO of this amount was paid to J.
J. Conlon, another member of the com
mittee, for his consent to the deal, and
that the third member, William A.
Kemp, it is asserted, allowed the mat
ter to go- through at the request of Phil
Crimmins, but that he failed to get a
slice of the bribe money, and has been
trying to drown his sorrows in copious
draughts of alcoholic beverages ever
since.
When the School Board was handling
the supplies contracts the people kept
a watchful eye on its proceedings. The
lowest bidders did not win out In every
case: in fact, it was apparently a case
of the highest bidder being received
with the most favor. Naturally these
circumstances aroused suspicion. It
was evident that there was something
crooked. Ginn & Co., Payot, Upham &
Co. and Cunningham, Curtis A Welch
were awarded the contracts. Director
Kemp had championed the cause of
Brown & Powers, whose bid to furnish
ink, paper, pencils, etc., was at least 25
per cent lower than the next lowest.
SCHOOL DIRECTOR W. A. KEMP, WHO BEMOANS HIS
HARD LUCK.
At the critical moment Kemp fell down
on his men. He conveniently absented
himself from the meeting when final
action was to be taken. He did this,
it is asserted, at the request of Phil
Crimminp.
The crooked work of the crooked out
fit might have remained a secret had
not Dr. Gedge confided in too many
friends. After the deal had been con
summated and public indignation over
the looting of the school funds had in
a measure cooled off, this man told his
friends the part he had played in the
deal. ITo repeated the story to too
many. The result is that The Call is
able this morning to expose the whole
deal.
When bids were first invited Dr.
Gedge and J. J. Conlon were ap
proached with a proposition to allow
a certain firm to inspect the specifica
tions and insert in them the name of
a particular brand of stationery, for
which this firm was the sole agent and
which could not be procured on the
coast except through it. Gedge and
Conlon agreed to the deal upon the
promise that they would be well paid
for their crookedness. Conlon made
Gedge his agent in arranging the finan
cial details. The specifications were
changed as requested, and after tho
little joker had been inserted they were
recommended for adoption by the com
mittee. Kemp had not been taken 'nto
the arrangement and did not "catch
on" until'long after the contracts were
awarded.
The change enabled the tricky con
tractors to make their figures as high
as they pleased. They were after a fat
contract and they secured it, consid
ering the bribe money small at S2OOO.
Brown & Powers had a much lower
bid, but of course they could not fur
nish the brand of goods called for in
the specifications. Kemp made a great
show of fighting for the best goods at
the cheapest prices and did some, argu
ing for Brown & Powers, but when it
came to the final show-down he let his
men and their bid take care of them
selves and did not attend the meeting.
The reason has been stated. He denies
that he was given a consideration to
stay away, and from the manner in
which he has been bemoaning his fate
for being on the outside when the un
PKICE FIVE CENTS.
equal division of the spoils was matfe
it is more than likely that he is telling
the truth in this instance.
No money was paid to Gedge until
after the contract was awarded. The
agent apparently knew that a man who
would sell himself and betray his con
stituents for such a comparatively
paltry sum could not be trusted to de
liver the goods after he had his fingers
on the bribe. But when the contracts
were signed the representative of the
firm waited on the doctor and handed
him $2000 in $20 gold pieces. Later $SOO
was paid by Gedge to Conlon. The
basis upon which the division was
made is a secret that is said to be
locked in the bosom of Gedge.
Some time after this Kemp heard the
rumors that money had passed without
any of it sticking to his palms. He
went on a still hunt for information
and found enough to make his heart
sick. To use his own language, he "felt
like being kicked." He learned of se
cret committee meetings where he had
not been invited; it dawned on him
suddenly why he had been requested
to remain away from the meeting when
the contracts were awarded. He awoke
to the horrible revelation that he had
been a real good thing for some one
without receiving a single twenty.
Then Mr. Kemp did some talking.
On the highways and byways he com
plained of his treatment at the hands
of the supply committee, of which he
was a member, "*e got real mad at one
time, but it did not do him any good.
Gedge and Conlon had the coin and
they evinced no disposition to part with
any of it. As a solace to his wounded
feelings and his aching pocket .he im
bibed freely; he found some comfort in
the cup that cheers, and in this condi
tion words gurgled from his mouth like
the liquor from tho little brown jug,
and to all who would listen he poured
out his tale of woe.
Mr. Kemp was seen last evening by
a representative of The Call. "When
the $2000 deal was mentioned to him he
feigned surprise, but he could not con
trol his interest in the subject.
"The very tiling that I have been
trying to find out â the very thing," said
he, and then to himself: "Kemp, Kemp,
where have you been? Two thousand
dollars lloating around and you did not
get a cent of it. Why any one to hear
this would think that I came from the
country; wouldn't they?" The reporter
acquiesced. "Why 1 ought to be kicked,
I ought â no, no, I don't exactly mean
it that way. 1 would not take a cent
if it were offered to me â I wouldn't.
But then when a fellow hears about
$20 pieces flying through the air his
mouth waters a little. It is natural â
the most natural thing in the world,
even among us strictly honest people.
No use talking, Kemp deserves kicking.
"Gedge and Conlon might have ar
ranged this matter at secret meetings
where I was not invited. I will not say
that I know of such meetings. I can
not call to mind that I have heard of
any such nor will I say that I have not.
I know Phil Crimmins very well and
frequently talk with him about school
matters in general, just as 1 would talk
with any one else. He might have asketi
me to stay away from the meeting
when the contracts were awarded, but
I don't just remember whether he did
or not.
"1 favored the bid of Brown & Pow
ers because it was the lowest and the
class of goods offered was fully up to
the standard. If any crooked work was
done it was done by the firm that bid
on the same articles that they did.
They bid on the ink, paper and stuff
of that kind. I believe the contract for
that was awarded to Cunningham, Cur
tis & Welch. My men would have got
it had I been at the meeting.^ I would
have raised a howl, you bet."
"Then you admit that you did stay
away?" was asked.
"No, noâ l did not mean exactly that
âI was there. Let me thinkâ well, I
really do not know whether I was
there or not."
'â¢Did you receive any compensation
for staying away?"
"Not a cent," and the look of sadness
on Kemp's countenance spoke louder
than anything he could have said.
"Kemp, where did you come from? You
deserve to be kicked. Twenty dollar
pieces floating about and you did not
get one of them. That in just my
.luck."2

his Government years before regarding
the "120 short" Held. He said that only
the internal construction of the brake in

After refuting the Imputations against

he said were purely hypothetical, M.
Demange continued emphatically: "The

read letters from Esterhazy proving that
the latter attended the Chalons camp and
probably witnessed the trials.
"But .the prosecution," added M. De

Dreyfus guilty and could not do so. On '
the contrary, we have shown that Drey

that it was with reference to the com
mand of these troops that the leakage
occurred, while he now asserted that it
was regarding the mobilisation and trans- !
portation of troops.
The 'prosecution has thus advanced two
versions, which must cause the Judges
terrible searching of conscience, especial
ly as no proofs had been furnished. "What
right had the prosecution to advance
statements with out corroboratlon?"
Counsel put it to the conscience of the i
Judges, and he had asked this of General
Mercier himself.
Continuing to plead with great warmth
and eloquence and with closely reasoned
arguments, which were followed with
breathless interest by the entire audience,
M. Di mange declared he did not believe
in the complicity of Henry and Bsterhasy,
for Henry was honorable and loyal. If he ;
had been the accomplice of -hazy,
Henry would have destroyed the bor- i
dereau. Possibly Henry had inadvertent
ly divulged information to Ester hazy, un
| der the impression that he was convers- '
I ing with an honorable, straightforward i
I man like himself, and discovering in ISW
I that he had placed his hands in a traitor's I
he committed a crime upon which counsel
declined to enlarge, since the perpetrator |
had already paid for it with his life.
"What other explanation could be given
of the suicide of this man, with whom the
whole army sympathised, even after the]
discovery of the crime? Henry had spoken !
of scoundrels. Was one of these not Es- i
terhnzy and the other Weyl. th. latter
having unconsciously betrayed Informa
tion? General Saussier had every confi- 1
dence in Henry's loyalty and Esterhazy
might have received infromation from
Henry or Weyl. who were unconscious
informer?. A loyal soldier. General Billot
had moreover said the traitor was not
alone. In his mind he connected the
names of Esterhazy arid Dreyfus." Coun- 1
sel did nor profess to clear up the matter,
but he wished it to be cleared up. It must
be proved that Dreyfus knew Esterbazy i
and WeyL He (M. Demange) did not fear
whatever light could be thrown on the '
case. Three men were in the intelligence
dt-partmentâ Henry. Bstexhasy and vveyL
Ksurhazy had even placed the others
under- pecuniaary obligations and ail three
were closely bound. together. -â¢ -^
Replying â¢to the hypothesis deduced In
the note relating to the modification of
: the artillery .-, M Demange â¢ pointed out
that the information could have been
obtained by Esterhazy at . thÂ« Chalons
camp, while, regarding the Madagascar
note. Dreyfus had never .had pos
session of it. though one of his bitter per
secutors. Colonel Dv Paty de Clam, nad
iit in his office. Reverting to the firing
manual, counsel showed bow Esterhazy
secured a copy of it and pointed to the
fact that his Government hnd asked
â¢ Colonel Bchwarskoppen for supplemen
tary information which showed that the
. riginal Intelligence was,. Incomplete and
supplied by an incompetent person, not
an artilleryman. The- memorandum to
Colonel Schwarzkoppen asked for the
llring manual, which must therefore
have been i offered, and for the gradua
tion bar which Esterhazy had obtained
from a friend and kept. Had all these
proofs existed against Dreyfus how
strong would have been the case .or the
prosecution. But the hypothesis was
I not even probable, while the theories of
the defense were all supported by docu
-1 ments colled from the secret dossier.
Dealing with the last line of the bord
erwtu referring to the manuevers, :M.
Demange produced a note written by
â¢ Dreyfus proving that he knew in May.
1594, that he would not attend th& man
i euvers with his regiment.
'< Counsel dwelt upon tho importance of

anything.
M. Demange protested against the Gov

had been agreed that the probationers

;of the headquarters staff, and said he
wished to know if Major Carriere adhered

Continuing, M. Demange exclaimed:

Prominent residents of San Francesco
are of the opinion that- the second con-'
viction of Captain Dreyfus , is' an In
justice, but that the verdict probably
saves France from a revolution. Here
are some interesting expressions on the
subject:
Raphael Welll, a leading representative
of the French .colony in San Francisco: â .
"1 have not for a moment since the flndrj!
Ing of the Supreme Court of France at
tributing the bordereau in pjain language
to Esteihazy, but leaving the revision of
tin trial of 1534 to its natural judges, the
military court, expected â  any other ver- '
diet than the one rendered at RennÂ» s. The'!
matter Is not ended here. Dreyfus per
sonally must disappear, and the- mojn,en- ;
lous time has now arrived whin France
must come to a conclusion whether .the.'
military oligarchy is to reign supreme.,;
If It la to reign. Its dislocation is | not
very far off. i hope the spirit of 17S0 will 1
be revived, and that this court of liars,"
forgers iind perjurers will Ond In a new:
revolution their downfall and the resur
rection â¢â ! a great and liberal France," j
Speaking of further proceedings under
the French system; Mr. Welll said: "This
case will naturally go to a military court
of appeals, where only thÂ«vcold law will
be considered: I have no doubt the court
of appeals will ainrni the Judgment of
the court-martial. The condemned man
cannot bo to a civil court, but it the Min
ister of Justice finds an error upon any
new point or revelation he can have the
Cassationâ the .supreme court of France
take the matter under review. The su-Â«
preme court may order another revision
or dismiss the whole proceeding. ThÂ« en
couraging sign to meâ the one ray of
sunshine In ail the darknessâ is that two
members of the court-martial had the
courage to vote tor acquittal. In France
the Judges vote viva voce, and the names j
of the junior members of the court are
called first. I have an impression that the
younger officersâ those nearest to the
peopleâ voted for acquittal."
Dr Louis Bas*t, 910 Geary street, late
member of the Board of Health: "what
do I think of the verdict? What can I
think In view of the meager information
furnished me through the columns of the
newspapers, and besides from the fact
that the Government has withheld the
secrets of the dossier? At firstâ that is,
at the time that Dreyfus was on his first <
trialâ] believed him guilty. 1 did not
consider that the French Government
would place an Innocent man on trial on
such a serious charge as high treason If
there were not some proof against him.
With this view of it I believed him guilty.
Hut when the court of revision on a care
ful examination of the evidence laid be
fore it overruled the first trial and gave
Dreyfus a new trial, then I changed my
mind and now 1 believe him to be inno
cent. I think, however, that the French
Government will ere long recognize this
fact and restore Dreyfusâ if not to actual
active service in the army to at least his
liberty. The public mind is so disturbed
at present that it would be unsafe to
acquit Dreyfus. It would be the means
of creating a revolution, and, to prevent
this which would be a calamity to the
whole nationâ had to be convicted.
That is all that there Is to It. There is
one thing very certain, and this Is that
if Dreyfus were tried In the United States
he would not be convicted on the kind of
evidence adduced against him in France. \
The Government should have given the;
contents of the dossier to the public- as
well as thÂ« evidence against the accused,
but this might antagonize foreign Gov
ernments and Embassadors. The end is
"Lipman Sachs of Sachs Brothers, Bush
and Sunsome streets: "I consider the
finding of the court-martial very unjust
in face of the evidence otteredâ or, at
leaÂ«t -Â much of it as has been submitted
to the public. Yet, considering the state
of the public mind of the people of
France, no other verdict could be ren
dered which would save the nation from
a revolution. It was either convict an
innocent man and save the military, or
acquit an innocent man and destroy the
military and bring about a revolution.

AMERICANS TO APPEAL
IN DREYFUS' BEHALF
NEW YORK, Sept. 9.â Upon learning: the verdict of Ihe Dreyfus
oourt-martial. Assistant District Attorney Maurice B. Blumenthal took
steps for the organization of a committee af citizens, irrespective of re
ligious belief, and including clergymen of different denominations, to
hold a mass-meeting to protest against the conviction of Captain
Dreyfus. A representative committee will be appointed to wait upon
President McKinley and petition him to appeal to the President of
France to pardon the unfortunate victim. Mr. Blumenthal asserts that
the sentence imposed is of itself proof that the court-martial returned a
verdict of guilty not as the result of their belief in Dreyfus' jruilt, but
partly as a result of^ first, religious hatred and bigotry, and second to
vindicate the attitude of the army and to save from disgrace and pun
ishment the officials who organized and carried out the awful con
spiracy..
, fus,, there 'would, he no exposition, and
there, would nave been no money to spend
in Franco from foreigners In I'.hk). In
; short. Dreyfus had to be convicted to
I say and her army."
j >â¢ San ford Sachs, merchant, 214 Pine street:
] "Dreyfus had to be convicted to save
i France from a revolution. That is all |
I there it: to that. It was much easier to
| cu'ivict one man than put down a rebel
! lion. The, military arm of the Govern-
J in. in had to be upheld at whatever cost
it might be to Dreyfus, justice and the
I people who sympathized with him and the i
; cause of innocence and fair play. Hut .

State* he most assuredly would not have
been convicted.' A military court-martial
in which the honor of the miiitao was at
stake against- one man was too much to
be overcome. Poor Dreyfus hbul to be
crushed to save the army."
Rev. Jacob Nleto, rabbi of the Congrega
: tion Sin nth Israel: "1 have the utmost
confidence, in .-the 'sense of Justice for
I which the French people are noted, i
don't believe that this attempt to throw
! the t-U-.in of dishonor upon this poor, un
fortunate man by the generals of the |
army in order to shield their guilty selves
from detection will meet with that degree
of success which the perpetrators of this
I outrage anticipated tor their diabolical
I scheme. The opera bouffe and Its Unaie
has been most ludicrous. It Is more the
dignity of France, which has been |
humbled to the dust, and the honor of the
French people that has been stained.
Who ever heard of a man guilty of treason
| with extenuating circumstances that was
, neither insane nor in fear of his lifo at
the time he committed what he supposed
I to be. the treasonable act? I feel conn
! dent that the wrong will bo righted for
the honor of France and that Dreyfus
will yet receive justice at the hands of
I his people."
rsatas W. Hellman, president of the
Nevada National Bank of San Francisco:
"The wrongful conviction of Dreyfus is
the result of the hopeless corruption ex
isting in the French army. Had the man
who had been trlen" for betraying the
trusts of his country been acquitted an
exposure of army methods would have
been the next great sensation in Francs
; Realising this the officials banked all fu
â¢ ture scandal by Bending an innocent man
to prison and prevented an Investigation

people of France know what nas hap
pened, but all the expressions of the hon
est and the just will not right the injus
i tice which has been done. I do not appro
I hend any revolution In consequence of the
. result of the trial."
Attorney General They L. Ford: "I am
1 not sufficiently acquainted with the judi- ;
â  cial procedure In France, nor have 1 read
i the evidence with that care that would
! entitle mo to express any opinion that
i would carry with it much weight or value.
! However, from what knowledge I have of
the case I atnVuuite certain that the evi
-1 dence against Dreyfus at his recent trial
was not sufficient to convict him in an
< American court. As to the laws of France i
1 know but little except as to those laws {
which have been transplanted in Amer
lea but particularly in the State of Lou- i
isiana: and what I say. therefore, is based
j upon American laws and American proce
j dure and the sufficiency of evidence in an
' American court. Guided by these stand
ards, the conviction of Dreyfus was ab- !
'â  solutely unwarranted by the evidence."
Rabbi M. S. Levy. Congregation Beth- i
Israel: "The result of the trial is a blot i
i on the jurisprudence of the present age. j
' It certainly demonstrates that the army :
at all hazards is to be sustained at the I
; expense of Justice. The boasted equality,
fraternity and liberty of Frenchmen is
henceforth a hollow mockery and a sham. j
I The French people, unstable as water, in
their wild delirium of "Vive I'armee" have i
demonstrated their inability for self- I
government. While it has taken 400 years
to teach Spain that vengeance belongs to j
I the Lord, it will take less time to prove It
' to France. The end Is not yet."

explained?
Counsel said he was convinced the
bordereau was written In his natural
hand by Esterhazy. The paper on which
It was written also condemned Ester

Then M. Demange examined at length ,
the theory that Esterhazy was a straw
man. and showed that this was ren
dered quite untenable by every action
of Colonel Picquart, who was accused
of trying to effect the substitution. How,
If Esterhazy was a straw man, could he
havo lost his head at the moment of his
arrest to such an extent that he con- i
templated suicide? The lawyer contrast- ;
ed the llvos of Dreyfus and Ssterhasy,
saying there were nothing but Idle tales ;
against the former, while the latter was
always iii search of a 5-franc piece. When
the time arrived for the Judges to say
whether the bordereau was in the hand

remember that all the experts admitted :
that it Was not, while all of them Rd- !
mitted that it showed traces of Ester- I
hazy's handwriting. They would also !

All who have watched the, proceedings
must reach the conclusion that the ver
dict is another miscarriage of justice.
France has been tried by the civilized
world ami found wanting. A chance was
given to France to redeem herself and
win back the good opinion of other na
tions, hut the enemies of France have
prevented the country from redeeming
its honor. If the result .should remain
unchanged civilized nations should show
their contempt for France, and there will
be a chance next year to stÂ»ow It. France
has outrag'd the best feelings of human
it> at the end of the century."
\V. \V. Foote, member of tho California
Paris Commission: "I have followed the
se< end trial of Dreyfus with great att< n
tion and Interest. la my opinion, based
on the evidence that has been published,
his conviction is an outrage on humanity
and a parody on justice. Nothing pre
sented during the whole course of the
trial warrants such a verdict, and the
findings of the court constitute a farce
which becomes a tragedy when their con
sequene'ea to Dreyfus are considered.
This decision of the French tribunal will
be Car-reaching in its effects. It will not
only touch the very foundations of French
official and political life but it will havo
its influence on the politics of the Tutted
States, and will possibly be very detri
mental to the Republican party in this
country In the Influence it will exert on
the next Presidential election, it wili

Rabbi Jacob Voorsanger: "The verdict

martial was composed of inferior men
wIh i have more or less the fear of their
chiefs before their eyes and of whom one
could not have expected a verdict accord

Court of Cassation had pronounced the
bordereau to be a forgery and it was fair
ly to be presumed that the court-martial
would not try the defendant on the issue
of treason as it was before the first court
martial in the shape of the bordereau.
This second court-martial lias simply ig
nored the conclusions of the highest judi
cial court in France and has pronounced
a verdict of guilty against a man who
stands untainted in the eyes of the civi
lised world and who is the victim of a
conspiracy in which the chiefs of the
French army are the leading criminals.
aided and abetted by tho Royalists and
ti,.- ultra-Montaines. Few people expect
ed Dreyfus 1 vindication at the hands .of
the second court-martial. But, despite
his condemnation, which simply proves
that the court-martial could not rise to
the dignity of an unbiased judicial trib
unal, the friends of Dreyfus are encour
aged because they feel the end is not yet.
Dreyfus must be either guilty or inno
cent. He has been declared guilty upon
evidence that would be thrown out of
court in any civilized country outside of
France. He will be declared innocent by
the love of justice that I believe still per
meatesÂ»the French nation and the end is
n<>t yet. Meanwhile, those who love re
publican principles, let them stand by and
await the contest between this one un
fortunate and his persecutors who have
their own end to serve and whose final
condemnation and overthrow is simply
a matter of time. If there be a little jus
tice left in this world, the farce of the
second court-martial will simply acceler
ate the final vindication of Captain Drey
fus."
William Sproule, traffic manager South
ern Pacific Company: "At this distance
we cannot fairly judge the verdict. It
must be considered that the methods of
conducting a trial and the manner of tak
ing testimony in France are widely differ
ent from the proceedings in this country.
In the dispatches reporting the trial
some little shade of color may have been
given."
William Alvord, Hank of California: '*]
have great sympathy for Dreyfus, and
think that his punishment has been v. ry
severe, but I do not see how the verdict
of five of the seven Judges can be lightly
passed over."
George H. Wheaton, merchant: "Drey
fus' conviction by the court-martial is an
outrage, but I expected just such a ver
dict as was rendered."
Commissary began his reply. He prom
ised to be brief, and said he desired to
set before the court-martial a simple ob
servation:
"Weigh the Importance of the two cat- I
egories of witnessesâ those for and
those against the prisoner. Weigh the !
Importance and judge. In all the inde
pendence of your character and all the
strength of soldiers. Proof Is every
where. The hour of supreme decision has i
sounded. France anxiously awaits your |
judgment. I also await It confidently, i
fully maintaining the conclusion already
announced. I demand the application of
article 76 of the Penal Code and article
267 of the Military Code."
The demand of the Government Com
mlssary caused a great sensation in
court.
M. Demange arose to. reply, and his
voice was hoarse from fatigue. He said:
"The Government Commissioner !n re
minding you of the text of the law has
also reminded us of what we already
know, namely, that you are only an
swerable to your -conscience and God for j
your verdict. This is my last word In i
this case. I feel that as men of honor :
and loyalty, and as military officers,
you will never accept as proof the hy- |
pothesis and presumption advanced here,
consequently my last word is the same I
spoke this morning. I have confidence
in you because you are soldiers."
Colonel Jouaust, president of the court,
asked Dreyfus If he had anything to say
in his behalf.
The prisoner arose and In a voice
choked with emotion declared he had only
one thing to say, but of that he was
perfectly assured. He said, "I affirm be
fore my country and before the army that
I am innocent. My sole act has been to
: save the honor of my name, the name
borne by my children. I have suffered
five years of the most awful torture. But
to-day I feel assured that I am about to
attain my : desire,' through your loyalty
and justice."
Colonel Jouaustâ Have you finished,
Dreyfus? â¢ : 'â ' ;l/i'-.
. Dreyfusâ Yes. Mr. President.
The" court then retired to deliberate,
and the prisoner left the hall, never to
return, as, in ..accordance with the law,
the verdict was rendered in his ab
sence.
â¢ The ringing of a bell announced the en-
; try of the -judges, -â * an officer ordered
"Carry arms!" 'and '.'Present arms!" the
rattle of rifles followed, and then Colonel
Jouaust marched In. saluted and laid his
kepi on the table. The other judges did
likewise, the gendarmes shouted silence
and the stillness of death fell on the audi- j
ence, who waited, heart in mouth, for the |
announcement of Dreyfus' fate.
Colonel Jouaust then began reading the
judgment, which opened with the ques
tion referred to the judges by the Court
:of Cassation: . . : : - â 
.-. "Was Dreyfus , guilty of entering . into
! machinations to send secret documents
to a foreign country?"
He then Rave the answer that the court
by a majority of five to two found Drey
fus guilty.- 1 ' " ' . ' v â  " â 
The silence was immediately broken by
a rushing of the reporters to- drop their
previously prepared telegrams into the
fetter box opening into the street, and a
gendarme received them and gave them to
the- respective messengers for transmis
sion by wire. The noisÂ« called forth a >

interfere, and there was not the slightest
disorder.
The judgment was read to Dreyfus in
an adjoining little room by the clerk of
the court, M. Coupers. Dreyfus listened
impassive, did not give the slightest sign
of emotion, did not utter a word and
marched back to prison like an automa
ton.
It is understood Dreyfus will ho sent to
Fort Corte, in the island of Corsica.
A largo crowd, which the police kfpt
moving, waited around the square in
Which the telegraph office and the prin
cipal cafes are situated. When the peo
pk' learned the court had been out an
hour it was argued that this meant a diÃ
afreemeut in favor of Dreyfus. The first
Indication trt these watchers that a result
had h( en reached was when a soldier on
a bicycle came tearing along as fast as
he could from the L.ycee toward the artil
lery barracks.
The soldiers and gendarmes keeping the
streets free sat up in their saddles and
watched the bicyclist as long as he re
mained in sight. This orderly was dis
patched before the court returned, as an
other live or ten minutes elapsed before
the army of reporters and messengers on
foot and on bicycles came in a wave up
the str"et, and the telegraph offlce was in
a pandemonium.. Tt was literally packed
v.itli m^n and women, all struggling to
ward the two little windows where the
dispatches were filed. Meanwhile the
news of the condemnation of Dreyfus had
filtered out to the crowd, but it produced
no excitement.
HOW THE NEWS WAS
RECEIVED BY PARISIANS
PARIS, Sept 9.â At 5 o'clock this
evening every available cafe seat in
the boulevards was occupied, and
minor scuffles were frequent. At about
5 o'clock the Gaulois exhibited to an
enormous crowd a placard on which
were the words "Vive l'Armee,"
which indicated that the verdict was
anti-Dreyfus. The announcement was
greeted with a deep hum of approval
and joy.
The L-ibre Parole announced that
Dreyfus had been condemned to im
prisonment for life. The editions were
absolutely torn from the hands of the
vendors. Tt was almost impossible to
hear opinions friendly to the prisoner.
The masses were hostile to Dreyfus.
But in private circles the verdict was
condemned in strong terms.
The anti-revisionists continued to is
sue editions suppressing the fact that
Dreyfus was condemned to only ten
years' detention.
In the presence of the extraordinary
sentence it is believed the tribunal rec
ognized the prisoner's innocence, but
waa afraid of the generals and public
opinion, and that as Dreyfus has suf
fered five years' cellular imprisonment,
which in France counts for double, he
will bo immediately released.
As this dispatch is sent the excite
ment was wearing away and the peo
ple were leaving the boulevards.

II Has Happened
More than once that a child has been
carried off by an eagle. When such
a thing does happen the press rings
with the story. There's not a line
given by the press to the babies car-
ried off daily by disease. It isn't the
fact of the child being taken .away
that is startling or interesting, it's
only when the method of taking off
is novel that it excites interest. How
many children die who might have
been saved if the mother who bore
them )Â«ad been able to give them
strength and vitality. Dr. Pierces
Favorite Prescription makes healthy
mothers and healthy lathers have
healthy children, strong enough to
resist disease if they are attacked.
Mrs. Axel Kjer, of Gordonville, Cape Gir-
ardenu Co.. Mo., writes: "When I look at my
little boy I feel it mv duty to write to you.
This is my fifth child and the only one who
came to maturity; the others having- died
from lack, of nourishmentâ the doctor
said. This time I just thought I would try
your ' Prescription.' I took nine bottles and
to my surprise it carried me through and
gave us as fine a Httle boy as ever was.
Weighed ten and one-half pounds. He is
now five months old. has never been sick a

DR. KILMER'S REMEDIES.
DR. KILMER'S SWAMP-ROOT "
Is Not Recommended for Everything.
But if You Have Kidney or Bladder
Trouble It Will Be Found Just
the Remedy You Need.
Kidney trouble preys upon the mind,
discourages and lessens ambition;
beauty, vigor and cheerfulness soon
disappear when the kidneys are out of
order or diseased.
Kidney trouble has become so preva-
lent that it is not uncommon for a
child to be born afflicted with weak kid-
neys. If the child urinates too often,
if the urine scalds the flesh, or if. when
the child reaches an age when it should
be able to control the passage, and it
is yet afflicted with bed-wetting, de-
pend upon it, the cause of the difficulty
is kidney trouble, and the first step
should be. toward the treatment of these
important organs. This unpleasant
trouble is due to a diseased condition
of the kidneys and bladder and not to
a habit as most people suppose.
So we find that women as well as
men are made miserable with kidney
and bladder trouble and both need the
same remedy. The mild and the im-
mediate effect of Swamp-Root is soon
realized. It is sold by druggists, in
fifty-cent and one dollar sizes. You
may have a sample bottle by mall free,
also pamphlet telling all about It, in-
cluding many of the thousands of tes-
timonial letters received from sufferers
cured. In writing Dr. Kilmer & Co.,

CHOSE DELEGATES
TO CONFERENCE
Work of Methodists at
Pacific Grove.
St>orl;il r'lsr'atch to The Call.
PACIFIC GROVE, Sept. 9.â The ses
sion of the Methodist conference to-day
â  was given over largely to balloting for
the remaining fou: delegates and three
alternates to the coming General Con
ference. An executive session of the
body was held in the afternoon. Quite
a division among conference members
existed regarding the proper persons to
elect as representatives from this body
;to the general body, and votes were
badly scattered, necessitating the tak
: ing of four ballots to elect the requisite
number of delegates. Considerable
electioneering was noticeable about the
vestibule and ante-rooms of the church
before the conference convened and
often during the session, but on the
whole men elected are very satisfactory
to the conference.
The first ballot was taken at 9:30 !
this morning, 173 votes being cast, mak
ing 87 necessary to elect. Dr. E. Mc-
Cllsh, chancellor of the University of
the Pacific, received 130 votes and Dr.
F. D. Bovard of Santa Rcsa 111. Both
were declared elected. On the second
ballot Dr. E. R. Dille of Oakland was
elected, receiving 11!" votes. The third
ballot resulted in no election. E. i*.
Dennett and J. N. Beard tying, and on
the fourth Dennett received the ma
jority.
This makes the complete list of dele
gates as follows:
J. D. Hammond, Eli McClish, F. D. !
Bovard, E. H. Dille-, E. P. Dennett; al- |
ternates, Robert Bentley, J. N: Beard, j
and E. D. McCrary.
Business was carried on while ballots j
were counted, the presiding elders' re- j
ports being continued from Thursday.
Dr. M. c. Harris reported for the Jap
anese district. Dr. F. J. Masters the
Chinese district, Dr. S. G. Gale th.-
Napa district, and Dr. John Kirby the
Oakland district, all of which app ar
to be in a prosperous and flourishing
condition. During the morning session
a committee from the lay electoral con
ference and the lay association pre- !
sented greetings to the conference, and
Bishop Ninde responded on the part of I
the conference, speaking of the Interde
pendence of the laiety and the ministry j
of Methodism and the fraternal bond j
that connects the laymen with the
clergy of the church.
The committee announced the names I
of the delegates elected to represent
the laiety of this conference in the
General Conference, as follows: Rolla I
V. Watt, George D. Kellogg, and pro
visionally if equal lay and ministerial
r< presentation is allowed in the coming
conference, T. B. Hutchinson, Chauncy
H. Dunn and James A. Johnson.
On motion of the presiding elders,
the body voted to change the relation
of E. A. Wible, J. R. Wolfe, G. G. Wai- i
ters, Esdras Smith and W. F. Warren
from effective to superannuate, and at
his own request to make Dr. John Coyle
of Berkeley supernumerary for one
year. At 2 p. m. an executive session
of the conference was held for the pur
pose of looking into the question of debt
and other matters connected with the
maintenance of the University of the
Pacific. The debt of $58,000 now on the
institution is to be lifted by bonding.
Mix thousand shares were subscribed
for to-day. The question of making
the Institution interdenominational was
also discussed, but no conclusion was
reached.
The evening 1 session was devoted to
a meeting in the interest of the Twen
tieth Century movement. Dr. A. T.
Needham of Oakland presented the
subject with reference to liquidating
church debt and Dr. E. McClish of the
University of the Pacific with reference
to education.
COUNTESS DE RAISME
SWINDLED BY A GYPSY
I Special Cable to The Call and N'tw York Her
ald. Copyrighted, 1599, by James Gordon
Bennett.
PARIS, Sept. 9. â That amusing
gypsy, Cernusky Lazarowieh, gave his
impressions, disguised, as evidence in
the Dreyfus trial. Some one of the
same name, Lazarowich, played a minor
part in a little swindle whereby a lady
who has been youngerâ l am speaking
!of the Comtesse de Raisme â was in
duced to part with 75,000 francs in re
turn for a promise of marriage with a
gypsy violinist of the Higo type, only
more so, that is to say, blacker and
greasier.
His name is Backi. He spoke but lit
tle of any language, so Lazaro witch
translated his tender sp*-e<-hes for the
Comtesse and wrote letters for her
when Backl was absent. When Baoki
had got the 75,000 francs his absence
became permanent, and the Comtesse
brought suit against him.
The only satisfaction she has received
so far is to have her gipsy charmer sen
tenced to three years' imprisonment
and 100 francs fine. It is doubtful, how- ,
ever, when each of these debts to so
ciety can be collected for Backi is in
England. Â« '

| LONDON, Sept. 9.â War talk has
| been in everybody's mouth. From the
dignified statesmen to the saucy bar-
E maid, all are eagerly discussing the
chances of another conflict with the
, Transvaal. Nothing else has been
heard In the clubs and hotel corridors.
The jingo fever is at its height. A
declaration of war is looked fur at any
moment.
Yesterday's Cabinet council attracted
great public interest and attention,
more bo than any meeting of the Min
isters since the stormy days of the
Gladstone regime.
A large crowd of well-dressed per- i
son? assembled in Downing street and
. in the Foreign Office quadrangle, many
Americans being noticeable in the
throng. Among the Ministers interest
largely centered upon Mr. Chamberlain
and when he reached the Downing
street entrance of the Colonial Grace
there was a rush to get a close view
. of him. The War Office is very secre- j
tiv.- concerning England's preparations,
. but that department's officials have
been working day and night for weeks.
Tlv greatest activity reigns at Alder
shot and other Important military cen- j
1 ters. It is known that the expedition
â  ary forces to the Transvaal will have
i ' a considerable body of cavalry in ad
, dition to the mounted infantry at
. tat bed.
Military men agree that in the Boers
England will have an adversary the ;
! like of whom the British troops have
â  not faced since the Crimean campaign,
! ! and it is believed an overwhelming
force will have to be put in the field
: to insure success.
As to the cost of the campaign, a
statistician computes it would c< 3t
England Â£75,000,000, or as part of the
national debt, Â£2,000,000 a year, which,
of course, would come out of the poor
man's pocket through tobacco, beer or
tea. The Government, however, esti
mates the cost of the expedition at

PRETORIA, Sept. 9.â ln the course
of an interview to-day State Attorney
Smuts said that the Transvaal, having
withdrawn its offer of a five-years'
franchise, th-> conditions thereto at
tached, namely, the relinquishment of
suzerainty, also falls to the ground. He
: understands the Transvaal's last dis
i patch as an acceptance of the proposal
! for a joint commission of inquiry.
The Transvaal, he said, is anxious to
terminate the tension existing because
trade is stagnant and the country is
I being ruined. Hence tho Transvaal has
a greater interest than has th>- British
I Government in bringing about a settle- i
! ment. He declared that he fully !>â¢â â 
! lieved the British Government desired |
i a peaceful solution of the difficulty and i
expressed the opinion that the Trans- ]
vaal's last dispatch would further that
! end. ,
BERLIN, Sept. 9.â The probability of \
, war between Great Britain and the
f'rmisvaal is discussed with great in- i
i terest. The press comment is mostly (
i unfavorable to Great Britain. The gen
eral opinion seems to be that the Boers
j were wrong in making the suzerainty |
question the main issue. Still, while â 
! Great Britain has doubtless secured a (
free hand, it is not likely that Germany, ]
| France and Russia will remain impas- j
sivo spectators of all the complications
j which will possibly arise out of the war. ]
If the British are defeated there is a <
splendid chance for Germany in South j '
Africa, while in the case of a British <
victory the Boers will emigrate en
masse to German territory. Then, it is ]
| added, Great Britain will want also to
j oust Germany from South Africa. â

JAMES B. EUSTIS
CALLED BY DEATH
Former Embassador to France and Ex-
United States Senator From Louisiana
Succumbs to Pneumonia
THE LATE JAMES B. EUSTIS.
NEWPORT, R. L, Sept. 9.â James B. I
Eustis, Embassador to France during
; the .second Cleveland administration
and formerly a Senator from Louisiana,
: died at his summer home in this city
! at 8 o'clock to-night of pneumonia. M^.
Eustis was taken ill on Wednesday,
but the local physician thought the
trouble to be heart failure.
The patient grew worse on Thursday,
developing symptoms of pneumonia,
and ..n Friday there was a consultation
of physicians, who stated that there
was scarcely any hope of recovery. The
end came to-night very peacefully. Mr.
Eustis' son, James B. Eustis Jr., and
his daughter, Miss Celeste Eustis. were
at the bedside.
No arrangements have yet been made
for the funeral, but it is thought the
body will be taken to Louisiana.
Mr. Eustis came to his summer home
on Charming avenue, as was his cus
tom, early in July, intending to re
main until autumn. All the early part
of the Bummer he was in excellent
health, devoting many hours to a crit
ical review of the Dreyfus case, in
which was embodied much valuable
material gathered during his official
residence in France. The extreme heat
prostrated Mr. Eus-tis and at the time
It was attributed in part to overwork.
As he had never been troubled with
his heart, no special anxiety was fell
at the prostration, and later he seem
ingly recovered his strength and vigor.
It was not until the recurrence of the
trouble the past week that his illness
was looked upon in a serious light, and
then it was diagnosed as secondary
pneumonia. Emm the rapidity with
which dissolution came it is evident
that the disease was firmly rooted In
the earlier attack.
James Riddle Eustis, lawyer, soldier
and statesman, came of an old New Or
leans family, than which none stood
higher in Louisiana, socially or finan
cially. Leaving Harvard law school
he went directly to his father's office In
New Orleans and became an immediate
success. Possessed of remarkable in
tellectual powers, his legal learning, to
which he was constantly adding, his
ambitious industry and his wit, elo
quence and delightful manners gave
him an independent position while he
was still very young. With the break
ing out of the Civil War young Eustis
volunteered as aid de cam]) on the staff
of General Magruder and was with him
until the general was relieved after the
slaughter at Malvern JIM.
Mr. Eustis took part in various enter
prises and especially distinguished him
self at the battle of Galveston. Toward
the close of the war he went on the
staff of General Joseph E. Johnston,
remaining with him until he received
his parole, signed by General Schofield.
After the war Mr. Eustis went back
to his professional work. Always a
lover of books, he took his recreation
in his library, among other things
translating Guizot's "History of Civili
zation" into English.
He yielded to an invitation to go into
politics as a member of the Legislature,
and in that capacity was appointed a
member and afterward spokesman of a
committee of three sent to Washington
to try to arrange for the reconstruction
of Louisiana. His varied labors break
ing down his health, Mr. Eustis went to
Paris, and was there during the Fran
co-Prussian War.
Upon returning to this country he
distinguished himself as a professor of
law in the Louisiana State University,
as a practitioner before the higher
courts, and as a United States Senator
for ten years. Senator Eustis stood
up for what he regarded as Democratic
principles with characteristic frankness
and boldness. He was recognized as
one of the most eloquent orators in the
| Senate, the Senators basing their high
estimate of his oratory not so much on
speeches he made in open session as
upon those he made in executive ses
sion.
Curiously, yet naturally enough, the
best speech he ever made, which was
made in executive session during the
Panama Canal discussion, was a
eulogy on France, which stirred the
Senators so that they came from all
parts of the chamber to congratulate
him, the presiding officer sending him
a note saying that he could not wait
ujitil released from the chair to compli
ment him on his speech.
In 1593 President Cleveland, who was
a cordial friend of Senator Eustis. ap
pointed him Minister to France.

SACRAMENTO, Sept. 9.-The first
week of the -most successful State fair

in a blaze of glory to-night. The fact
that this was Admission day had con
siderable to do with the exceedingly
large attendance at the pavilion to
night. This was also Native Sons and

large numbers from various parts of
the State.
Delegations came from Sorenton,
"Woodland, Dixon, Lodi, Auburn,
Marysville, Gait, Elk Grove and other
localities and they were lavishly en
tertained by the members of the order
of this city. Some of the visiting par
lors brought brass bands with them,
and all day long the sound of music
could be heard in every principal por
tion of the town.
When the train from San Francisco
arrived the depot was jammed with
members of the Native Sons and
Daughters parlors, who were there for
the purpose of receiving a number of
special guests, among whom were Cap

PLAN OF CAMPAIGN
FOR THE DRY SEASON
WASHINGTON, Sept. 9.â General
Otis has been instructed in framing his
plan of campaign for the dry season to
allow for the fullest participation of the
naval forces now in the Philippines,
and as soon as he has been heard from
the necessary orders will go forward
to the naval commanders to co-operate ]
with the army to an extent not before i
contemplated. The naval officers have i
always been willing to do this, but j
they have been restrained in their op- J
erations by an indisposition to interfere
in any quarter with the plans of tho
military commanders. The ships will
undertake to capture any of the ports |
now in insurgent possession that may |
be desired by the army, and also to
hold them Indefinitely, thus making it
possible to open the railroad in Luzon
from the northern extremity, while in i

of marines now on hand, it is believed
that the navy ran undertake to relieve
tho soldiers tsationed there and make a
valuable force for othrr operations.

i at Oakland, haa begun a fight against sa
' loons and out-of-town roadhouses In
j Southern California, using as its weapon
| the sanitary district legislative act. C.
Garibaldi, who for years has conducted a
saloon a short distance outside the city
limits on Kast Colorado street, has been
chosen aa an example. The citizens of
i Lamanda Park, which Is the nearest post
office met and chose A. L. Schofleld. J. \V.
Hugus, C, A. Day, W. T. Sibley and \V.
A. Weymouth members of a sanitary
board, the district to be established if the
voters so decide at an election to held on
October 10. A majority of the ballots Is
necessary to elect.
The County Board of Supervisors Is
said to believe that the district Will be
established. If so, the sanitary board will
have power to grant or refuse a liquor li
cense and will close Garibaldi's saloon.
I The proprietor believes that his saloon
I will be dosed and has tried to sell out.
I Failing in this he has begun the erection
j of a winery in the belief that no author
ity hay power to prevent his selling his
Own product, even if the city should ex
tend its limits to include the winery.
The local Anti-Saloon League met re
cently and passed resolutions supporting
I the State League and Lamanda Park
League. The State League agrees to bear
the expense attendant to enforcing the
law and all incidental expenses should op
position be made.
Sivnild the election result in establish
ing the district, work will be begun on
other districts in this part of the Stp.te
which have been mapped out by th<- Anti-
Baloon L-ague. The Lamanda district
will comply pretty closely with the elec
tion precinct.
The citizens of North Pasadena have
acted upon similar lines as have the La
manda Park people. Their petition has
nut yet been act'Ml upon by the County
Board of Supervisors.

COMMENT ON
KAISER'S SPEECH
Many Catholics Are
Pleased With It.
Copyrighted, 1899, by the Associated Tress.
BERLIN, Sept. 9.â The Emperor's
Bpeecb at Strasburg is variously com
mented on. The Centrist Cologne Yolks
Zeltung i-ays the Cathollca are thankful
his Majesty tries to avoid every con
flict. The Vossische Zeitung considers
the speech to he evid< ntly a reply to
those m;i <i<- by ;i Bavarian priest in
Efetsse, who ;-a!d the throne and altar
could only be maintained by Catholicism.
The Emperor reverses the proposition.
The Boersen Courier says it remains to
be Been whether the relations between the
Emperor and Catholicism will really be
mutual. The Vorwaerta asserts that it
seems the Emperor returned from Pales
tine with a heightened opinion of the
possible usefulness of the church, adding:
"It is no longer the army and nobility he
asks to follow him. He now regards the
clergy ajso as an equally strong ally."
The Tagt-blatt says the Emperor's doc
trine is that of Charlemagne, "which
means antagonism to Papal power."
An eye-witness Informs the correspond
ent of the Associated Press that the Em
peror's reception at Strasburg and Stutt
gart showed that his popularity has
enormously increased in South Germany.
The applause was mostly genuine and
spontaneous. This was specially notice
able in Alsace.
The absence of the French military at
tache from Strasburg was commented
upon, and it is surmised that he acted on
orders from the French Government, so
as not to seem to recognize German dom
ination of the Reichland. It was re
marked, however, at the Strasburg pa
rade that the presence of French-speak
ing people was unusually large. A large
' number of correspondents of the leading
: French papers were present, and they
! were granted every facility and shown
every courtesy. Many of them will ac-:
company his' Majesty throughout the
whole maneuvers.
The noteworthy features of the man
euvers were the Jaegers (sharpshooters)
battalions of the Fourteenth Corps, who
I were equipped with Maxim guns. The
fourth, Eighth, Tenth and Fourteenth
battalions of the sharpshooters, forming
a brigade with three batteries of Maxims,
ecpecially distinguished themselves. The
.correspondent of the Associated Press
hears the Maxims stood the test so well
that all the Jaeger battalions of the army
will Vie equipped with them.
In order to make the resemblance to
| actual war as close as possible neither
1 the regular telegraph nor telephone lines
I were used within the whole maneuver
t. rritory. Instead special messengers on
1 horseback, pigeons and field telegraphs
were employed. Automobiles were used
in transporting provisions and ammuni
: tion and were found serviceable on paved
; roads in Wurtemberg, even on the steep
est grades. A remarkable achievement
, was the successful passage of the steep
! Kniebis pass, in the Black forest, V.VX)
I feet high, by the bicyclist division. The
i naval maneuvers near Heligoland have
i not been sensational.
Following the example of the United
States in the war with Spain the Govern
ment has ordered the equipment of a
number of repair ships for the navy,
i closely patterned after the Vulcan. These
will lie fireproof and will be used in train
ing firemen.

AN ENTIRE TOWN IS
DESTROYED BY FIRE
Probably the Worst Conflagration
Ever Known in the Forests of
Northern Wyoming.
DENVER, Sept. 9.â A special to the Re
; publican from Cheyenne, Wyo., says:
i Forest fires are now burning in the
I.aramie Peak timber district, in North
â  crn Albany County, and along Muddy
; Mountain, about twenty-five miles south
' east of Casper. Special Agent Abbott of
| the Interior Department, who went out to
j investigate and put out the fires if pos
| slhle, has a force of men working in the
Laramle Peak district, and hopes to over
come the flames within a few days. Noth
ing can be done towaxd fighting the
Muddy Mountain fire on account of the
dense smoke, and it will be allowed to
burn itself out.
During the fore part of this week the
j worst forest'fires in the history of North
| crn Wyoming raged in the mountains be
i tween the north and south forks of the
'â¢ Tongue River, west of Sheridan. Four
j townships were burned over and the town
;of Rockwood was wiped out. The tie
j camp of McShane & Co., together with a
number of sawmills and a large quantitly
of railroad ties and lumber, was de
stroyed. Many tlecutters narrowly es
caped.
LIFE BOAT EQUIPPED
WITH A GAG ENGINE
First Experiment of the Sort Ever
Tried Kesults in Every Way
Satisfactorily.
MARQUETT^, Mich., Sept. 9.â The first
test of a lifeboat equipped with power was
m.ule here to-day and, judging from the
performance, was in every way satisfac
tory. Lieutenant Charles W. McLellan,
assistant inspector of the Life-Saving
Service, was in charge of the experiment.
An ordinary thirty-tive-foot lifeboat had
been fitted with a twelve horsepower su
perior Ras engine. Under full power the
boat made a good rate of speed. During
the drill of the life-savers the boat was
rolled over and over, and showed that the
presence of the engine in the airtight
chamber in no way affected the ability of
the boat to right itself. The engine kept
running no matter what position the boat
was in. Up to this time lifeboats have
had but sails and oars, and It Is thought
engines of this typo will be of great util
ity. _^

QUAKER COLONY
IN THE FAR NORTH
Working Among Alaska
Indians.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PASADENA, Sept. 9.â C. C. Reynolds, a |
prominent business man of this city, has j
returned from a long stay In the country
about Kotzebue Sound, Alaska. Reynolds
and his partyâ a score of menâ were elab
orately equipped and built a steamer In j
Kotzebue, In which they prospected the
Kowak River thoroughly without nnding
gold enough to warrant the staking of a
claim. Tnis steamer, the Helen, was the
only one built in the sound. She is 10 feet
beam and 38 feet over all.
Mr. Reynolds is a leading member of !
the Friends church. While at Kotzebue
he was on very intimate terms with Mr.
and Mrs. Robert Sainms and Miss Anna
Hunnicutt, the three Friends missionaries
who went from Los Angeles and 'WhittJer
two years ago and located at Blossom
Cape for the purpose of instructing the
Indians. Despite the misgivings of friends !
of the missionaries, who feared that the
Indians would not be found to be hos
pitable, those missionaries have enjoyed
great success. They have erected a school
building, where the Indians come In the
Hummer to trade with the natives from
Siberia. The American Indians trade furs
to the Siberian Indians for skins of rein
deer, which are made Into clothes. They
are said to take kindly to instruction. The
methods employed by the missionaries are
similar to those of kindergarten teachers.
The English language is the first thing \
taught. Recently the missionaries, who
are without white companions, have built, i
with the aid of a few Indians who stay â 
there the year round, a steamer, with ,
which they visit the Indian villages on the !
Kowak during the summer, carrying with
them balm for minds and souls.
The missionaries have great hardships
to contend with. Mrs. Samms, who is
only 23 years of age, was forced last win
ter to walk forty-five miles over snow and I
ice while working among the Indians. She I
has often slept out on the ice in a deer- |
skin Bleeping-bag, with the thermometer
30 to 40 degrees below zero.
The Reynolds party left in the schooner
Penelope from San Pedro in May, 189S,
and only Mr. Reynolds has seen clviliza- i
tion since then. The other members of
the party are expected home some time
this fall. They failed to locate any claims
in the Kowak or Kotzebue country, but
have several claims near Cape Nome.
DEATH OF L. S. BUTLER.
Formerly Assistant Adjutant General
of the National Guard.
SACRAMENTO, Sept. 9.-L. S. Butler,
a watchman in the office of the State
Treasurer, died in this city this morning
unexpectedly. He marched with the Odd
Fellows Thursday night and was at that
time apparently well.
Butler was formerly a resident of Los
Angeles, and at one time was lieutenant
colonel and assistant adjutant general of
the National Guard of California.

The Son Francisco store, located at
1128 Market street, runs through the
entire block to Turk street, and occu-
pies !<oso square feet, employing forty-
four men and women. This is an all-
night store, and for five years has n>t
closed its doors once. The mail order
department occupies the rear or Turk
street side, and is under competent
management. The men who attend to
the wants of our country friends are
old-time experienced mail order men,
who know the shortest and quickest
routes and cheapest rates to the va-
rious points on the Pacific Coast. Th?y
understand wrapping and packing bot-
tled rredioines and drug sundries to
withstand the carelessness of postal
and express clerks. Mail orders receive
immediate attention and country cus-
tomers are not obliged to pay one cent
more for their purchases than our city
rustomers, except freight or express
charges, which we prepay on $5 orders
or over to railroad points within 100
miles of our stores.
The Los Angeles store, located at 320
South Spring street, was established in
\K<\ and is by far the handsomest ami
best equipped drugstore in the south-
ern city. It, too, is a cut-rate, depend-
able store, and supplies a majority of
the residents of Southern California,
Arizona, New Mexico and Mexico with
drug sundries. This store occupies 11,-
-2fÂ»o square feet and gives employment
to eighteen men and women.
The Oakland store was purchased
from Kirkland & Trowbridpre in l sr >'>
and turned into a cut-rate store imme-
diately. It is on the corner of Tenth
street and Broadway, right in the cen-
ter of the retail shopping district of
Oakland. Being BO close to San Fran-
cisco we do not encourage mail orders
from that point. This store supplies
and delivers drugs, medicines and toilet
articles to the residents of Oakland.

phones, directories, messenger service,
dictionaries, postage stamps, writing
desks and every other little thing that
so greatly adds to the comfort and
pleasure of shoppers and visitors.

We have recently established a labor-
atory in connection with our San Fran-

street . one block from the store. We
have leased three floors, 22x165 feet,
covering 10,890 square feet. Every de-

the most conservative figures are sur
prising to even the most sanguine. Count y
Assessor Ortman has found that 470.8 >

NO ELECTRIC LINE
FOR MARIN COUNTY
SAN RAFAEL,, Sept. 9.â J. A. MoNear,
the Petaluma capitalist, denied to-day
that he contemplates the building of an
electric railway from this city to Point
San Pedro, to connect with a line of
steamers to San Francisco, which would
compete with the Donahue road. Mr. Mc-
Near asserted that a boulevard should bo
constructed from San Rafael to the point,
and that an electric line would follow as
a natural consequence; but it is entirely
improbable that he will do anything ia
the matter at present.
So far as mere competition is concerned
the Donahue road has Httle to fear from
such a rival, as the distance by water
from Point San Pedro to San Francisco i 3
so great that a 3teamer would lose suffi
cient time to make nothing on a through
trip by the few minutes gained in travel
ing from this city to Point San Pedro.

AT THE LICK OBSERVATORY
Polaris, the North Star, Found to Be Composed
of Three Bodies That Are Con
tinually Revolving.
SAN JOSE, Sept. 9.â A discovery of
great scientific and considerable popular
Interest has just been made by Professor
Campbell with the great telescope of the
Lick Observatory. It is that Polaris, or
the north star, doubtless the bÂ»jst known
star in the whole firmament, is really a
triple system. Two of the bodies in this
system revolve around each other in a
period of four days, and at the same time
move in a much wider sweep around a
third body. In much the same way a3
th<> i arth and moon do around the sun.
The separate bodies which compose the
system cannot be seen with the telescope,
nor is it likely that they ever will be
seen with any instrument. Their exlst
la demonstrated by observations
made with a spectroscope. By a method
which need not be explained here the
ppeed with which a heavenly body is mov
ing toward or away from the earth can
be measured with a spectroscope at
tached to a telescope. The method has
been known for many years, but it is
only recently that the necessary- accu
racy for observations of stars has been
reached by the application of photogra
phy. There are various ways of eh. ck-
Ing the correctness of the results. Thus,
as the sun turns on its axis, one edge
is constantly approaching the earth and
the other is receding from it at the rate
nit l\ miles per second; the spectm
is found to measure this motion
correctly. A grain, the velocity with which
the planets are moving In the line of
fight can be calculated from the known
dimensions of the solar system, and in
this case also the reliability of the sDec

troscopic method has been proved. Ob
servations of ptrys by this method are
now being made at a number of the lead
ing observatories of the world.
According- to the laws of motion a body
once set in m/ition, and left to itself, will
move on foreVer, in a straight line, with
uniform velocity. Any change whatever
in its motion indicates the existence of
a disturbing force. The grreat majority
of the st.-u-s are found to move with un
changing velocity, but in a smnll num
ber of cases the velocity varies, and
these are of great interest to the astron
omer. A star may of course move across
the lire of sight, "as well as In it, but of
the former motion the spectroscope takes
no account.
The existence of a revolving system was
proved by this method in the case of the
famous variable star Algol. It had long
been assumed that the changes in the
light of this star were due to eclipses by
a dark companion, and the correctness
of the hypothesis was proved by Pro
fessnr Yog-el of Germany h.
Quite a number of similar cases are
now known, fourteen of which, including
the brilliant binary star Capella, have
been discovered at the Lick Observatory.
Polaris is now, however, the most inter
esting of these. The velocity changes !n
a period of 3 days 23 hours by about 6
kilometers or nearly fruir milt s per sec
ond. The longer period of change h;is
not yet been determined; it may amount
to several years. It may be some time
before this discovery is verified at other
observatories, as the high degree of ac
curacy necessary to measure with cer
tainty so small a change of motion has
an yet been reached only at Mount Ham

shortstop a great deal of praise. Shee
han took third on the play, and came |
home on O'Connor's single past short.
Eagran retired the side.
Pyne again led oft in the eighth with a
single and took second on a wild pitch.
Iberg struck out for the third time, and
Brockhoft lined one out to deep center,
scoring Pyne. The noise of jubilation had
hardly died out when Krug landed on the
.â â¢â¢ re. and as it soared to the right field
fence "Brock" romped to the plate. The
next Titan went out. and then two more
tallies were recorded for the local aggre
gation.
i: Lgran put up by far the best game for
Sacramento. He was all over his position,
taking everything in sight. Both pKch
ers were touched up. but their team
mates backed them up superbly. Both
nines arc on their mettle, and today's
game should be a crack-a-jack. Score:

GUARD ATTACKED BY
A BURLY CONVICT
Desperate Struggle at San Quentin
Prison With a Prisoner De
tected Violating the Rules.
SAN QTENTIN PRISON, Sept. 9.â
Thomas Molloy, a strapping convict serv
ing ten years from San Francisco for bur
glary, was detected In a violation of the
prison rules this morning by Guard Ran
dolph, and when an attempt was made
to remove him to the dungeon he fought
so desperately that Captain Russell and
Turnkey McClure had to be called to the
guard's assistance. Randolph received a
hard blow in the region of the stomach,
and was temporarily incapacitated for the
performance of his duties, but was not
seriously injured.
When Molloy was detected in the mis
demeanor he was in his cell and an at
tempt to remove him to the dungeon led
to a tumult, the other convicts rushing to
the windows of their cells and yelling
encouragement to the prisoner at the top
of th~ir voices. Molloy was finally lodged
in the "solitary," and will be kept there
until the Prison Board acts upon his case
next Saturday. Warden Aguirre states
that this is the first time the prisoner has
given the officials any trouble.

THE DREYFUS VERDICT.
OX the question, "Was Dreyfus guilty of enter
ing into machinations, to send secret docu
ments to a foreign power?" five members of
t ic court-martial at Rennes voted yes and two voted
no. The accused was therefore pronounced guilty,
but as the majority agreed there were extenuating
circumstance?, another vote was taken as to the pun
ishment to be inflicted, and the official announcement
of the result is "The court condemns by a majority of
five votes to two Alfred Dreyfus to the punishment o;
ten years' detention."
That is the judgment -.vhich the French court pro
nbunces upon the case which for so long a time has
engaged the attention of the civilized world, and
which in France has aroused such antagonisms be
tween the partisan* of Dreyfus and the partisans of
the army as at times to menace the security of the re
"\c itself.
The decision is not a logical conclusion of the trial,
â whatever view be taken of the evidence. If Drcyfu>
â were guilty < ; the treasonable crimes charged against
him he should be executed, for it is not easy to nn
â¢ -and how there can be extenuating circumstances
in a case of treason of that sort. If, on the other
hand, he be innocent, he should have received an
honorable acquittal instead of a conviction and a new
degradation.
To the world at large the verdict will appear as an
ntteir.pt to evade the isÂ«uie that has so disturbed
France. Dreyfus, being pronounced guilty, saves the
credit of the army and of the officers of the general
staff who condemned him in the first place. His re
lease after a short imprisonment, which is said to be
all that is meant by the ten years' sentence, will silence
the clamor of his friends by setting him free from
further punishment. The decision of the court is
fore a decision of expediency rather than of jus
tice. It is even likely that the Government, which i=
known to be desirous of getting rid of the case, may
' 'reyfus and thus summarily dismiss the issue.
Such a conclusion of the trial will satisfy neither
tide. The majority of intelligent men throughout the
civilized world will continue to believe Dreyfus inno
cent and to regard the higher officers of the French
army as guilty of a criminal conspiracy against him.
On the other hand, the enemies of Dreyfus will con
tinue to assert his guilt and insist that his punishment
uld have been death. To the statesmen who rule
France these dissatisfactions will be of little moment.
They have evaded a crisis. The controversy over the
case aher this will be hardly more than an academic
discussion. The incident itself is closed. It remains
t" be seen, however, whether in the end expediency
will have better results than would have followed the
courage to do justice.
The silver mine owners have given notice to the

An ingenionsly zealous Chicago attorney has dis

SOME BRYAN ISMS.
SAN FRANCISCO has heard Mr. Bryan again,
has heard him by thousands, cheered him, and
gone home, while he took to the road to make
another speech. His effort at Woodward's Pavilion
| was an excellent sample of his assertive style. To-day
I we propose to analyze only a portion of it, saying in
advance that the anti-imperial sentiment of the coun
try cannot be. and will not be, used to elevate Mr.
! Bryan to the Presidency.
In discussing the platform of iooo he said: "Do
you doubt that the demand for arbitration between
labor and capital is stronger to-day than it was in
I 1896? I believe it is stronger, and that the demand for
! arbitration will grow until the arbitration of disputes
between corporate capital and employes of capital
: will be as well systematized and as practicable as is the
court of justice to-day for the settlement of disputes j
' between man and man." Now all that is high sound- I
; ing and implies a great "Grievance" existing some
where, to cure which this Don Quixote appears, with
: a barber's basin for the helmet of Mambrino and a i
I basswood stick for the sword of Mundarra, offering j
: himself, for office, for the healing of the nations. His
talk on arbitration is in apparent ignorance of the fact
1 that it is in constant operation between employers
and employed. The essence of arbitration is that it
iis voluntary. That is the difference between it and j
' court of justice. When an issue goes to a court free |
: will ceases. It is no longer a voluntary matter. The
; plaintiff has stated his case and in his petition has
! demanded his remedy. The defendant must appear at 1
' the bar and give his reasons in avoidance of judgment. !
If these are not good in law, judgment rests upon him
' and is enforced by the court. If the defendant re
j fuse or neglect to appear he is in default, and judg- j
ment is entered against him. In the arbitration of
differences it is for both parties to assent or for either
to refuse. That is the essence of it. the mutual con
sent of the parties to the issue joined. This makes
the difference between arbitration and the courts of
I justice, and the difference is radical. Keeping in mind
i this element of consent, and of a tribunal in which
there is neither plaintiff nor defendant, one may well
ask, What docs Mr. Bryan mean when he speaks of
a "demand for arbitration?" Does he mean that there
jis to be a Federal or State statute compelling one
party to arbitrate when the other desires it? If so, he
will do away with the difference between arbitration
and the courts, for free consent will disappear, plaintiff
and defendant will reappear, and there will arise an
other series cf courts of justice with the same powers
now exercised by those which we have. The Bryan
arbitration by compulsion plan must of course
have power to enforce its judgments, for why compel
an unwilling and unconsenting party to appear un
| less the finding can be enforced?
It will be noticed that he speaks of corporations
and their employes as if no differences ever arise be-
I tween individual capital and the labor it employ:,!
I That is the demagogue way of putting it. and Mr.
Bryan cannot change his habits and methods. Let
us accept his idea of compulsory arbitration, which is
a paradox to juggle with and therefore suits him.
When corporate capital and its labor differ labor will
! have the right to force the corporation to arbitrate,
but that right will be valueless unless the despised
corporation can be compelled to submit to the judg
ment. If labor want' s 2 a day instead of $1.50 the
i corporation must be compelled to take back its em
| {loves and pay them $2. If it cannot be made to do
: this Mr. Bryan's paradox of compulsory arbitration is
to labor a delusion and a snare, and to capital an idle
; and idiotic threat. But, if labor can compel capital to
! arbitrate and to submit to judgment, under the same
compulsory processes capital can compel labor to ar
â  bitrate and submit to judgment If capital can be
forced to take men back into its employ at a wage
j fixed by arbitration, men can be compelled to work
for capital at a wage fixed by arbitration. How will
labor look at that side of Mr. Bryan's paradox?
Many laborers, no doubt, cheered him to the echo,
but how would they like to be driven to work for a
certain employer at a wage fixed by his plan of com
pulsory arbitration? Do they not see that it takes
rights from labor exactly in proportion as it abridges
the rights of capital, and that the only arbitration
must be by consent and cannot be by compulsion?
Mr. Bryan next took up "government by injunc
tion," opposition to which he declared would "in
crease until the people of this nation, acting through
the constitutions and the laws, will make it impossible
to take away from people accused of crime the right
of trial by jury to determine the guilt or innocence."
There is material at hand for testing this high sound
ing sentence. The writ of injunction is used to pro
tect the rights of property. The people of the Feather,
Yuba, Bear, Sacramento and San Joaquin river
valleys have been living under government by injunc
tion since Judge Sawyer's time. Hydraulic mining in
the mountains disturbed the equilibrium of their dirt
and bowlders and washed both into the river beds,
causing floods and covering the valley farms with
slickens. To protect their property the valley people
applied to Judge Sawyer for a permanent injunction
forbidding hydraulic mining anywhere that it imper
| iled the streams. Judge Sawyer granted the injunc-
I tion, and "the valley farmers of Butte, Sutter. Yuba.
Colusa and other counties have since lived under
government by injunction. They have enforced their
rights under that government. The Anti-Debris As
sociation has been watchful, and when the injunction
has been violated in contempt of the court that made
it perpetual the offender has been taken to San Fran
cisco and the court has punished him by fine or in
prisonment for contempt of its judgment. Now, what
I Mr. Bryan demands is that there shall either be no
injunction at all or that the violators of it shall be
tried by a jury drawn from the vicinity of the offense,
as the constitution requires in the case of juries. Do
not the valley farmers see that under such a system
they are deprived of all means of protecting their
perty by law? What chance would the Anti-
Debris Association of Sutter County stand prose
cuting a hydraulic miner before a Nevada County
jury? Yet that is the alternative offered by Mr.
Bryan for the present protection by injunction and
the power to enforce it by punishment for contempt of
court.
His position on arbitration and injunction is illus
trative of his mental attitude toward all public ques
tions. With no profound foresight into the conse
quences and results of the plans he advocates, they
are used, after the methods of demagogy, to catch the
unwary, and if he had the power to enforce them the
disasters that would follow would make the curses
of his victims louder than the cheers of his sup
porters are now.

rROM the earnestness with which representative
men of San Mateo County have expressed their
opposition to the gamblers' scheme of getting
Colma incorporated it is evident that if the issue were
to be left to the vote of all the people of the county
there would be no danger whatever. The gamblers
I would be outvoted by a majority so heavy they would
abandon the scheme at once and forever.
Unfortunately the issue will not be determined by
the vote of the whole county. Only the residents of ;
the district it is proposed to incorporate will have a
! vote, and as they are not numerous it will be a com
i paratively easy task for the political bosses like Buck-
Icy and the rest who are associated with the gam
blers to fill the district with voters who will do their
1 bidding at the polls. It is that fact which constitutes
the danger of the situation and arouses the watchful
ness of the people.
The issue is virtually in the hands of the Super
i visors. If that body concede the petition of the gam-
I biers for an election on the question of incorporation,
1 and great care be not taken to prevent the importa
! tion of toughs and touts and others of the gambling
push, it will be a foregone conclusion the gamblers
I will win out, for they have stacked the cards, loaded
: the dice and fixed the game. It will be in their hands,
i and the genuine residents and property-owners of
that pretty suburb will be helpless in the face of the
odds against them.
To the Supervisors, then, the people look for pro
â  tection. The incorporation of Colma by the gang
that is now seeking it means the establishment of a
wide open gambling hell of the worst kind. It will
draw to San Mateo the viler elements of the popu
! lation of San Francisco and blight the county as the
region around Sausalito has been blighted. It will
I be a place to be shunned by decent people, and be
come the resort of knaves and their dupes.
The exposure of the evil effects of the Ingleside
I racetrack gambling in this county has been so re -
I cently made the Supervisors of San Mateo cannot
have forgotten the dreadful record of crimes and
t tragedies that were traced to that source. Moreover,
they must be aware of the disgraceful scenes that have
I been again and again enacted in Sausalito in the strife
of one set of gamblers against another. There may be
many points for the Supervisors to take into consid
eration in dealing with the issue, but surely the de
termining one must be that of protecting the commun
ity from crime.
The Mole St. Nicholas man seems to have changed

Business men are shy of accepting local Demo

election that a shyness of votes in their pile was ample
justification of their first thoughts.
r^ COMMUNICATIONS from Washington fore
l casting the financial recommendations of the
Government agree that at the coming session
Congress will be asked to revise the war revenue bill
for the purpose of correcting certain defects which
have been found in it, and also for the purpose of in
' creasing the amount of revenue derived from it. Such
revision will be in accord with the popular wish, for
ever since the law has been in operation it has been
evident the ambiguities of the language of the act
have made room for tax-shirking on a large scale by
; great corporations and the consequent shifting of the
tax upon the public.
Among the largest of tlie^e tax-shirkers the ex
press companies have been notorious. The Call has
repeatedly pointed out the many tricks the Wells-
Fargo Express Company has practiced on this coast
in evading the tax. No sooner was the law enacted
than the express company requested The Call to con
nive at a scheme for shirking the tax and promised a
share of the profits. By the scheme suggested the
express company offered to receive from The Call a
whole wagon-load of papers as one package, thus de
; frauding the Government of that much of its just
I revenues. The Call as a matter of course refused to
i be a party to the swindle and promptly exposed the
, proposal. It is quite likely, however, that some other
| largt shippers may have joined in the scheme and that
tiie Government has been defrauded all along in that
w?y.
Recently suit was brought against the company by
a firm of merchants who allege that for a considerable
time the express company took goods from them for
shipment without requiring them to pay the stamp
taxes. That was done for a large shipper, while
smi-ller shippers were compelled to pay the tax. Thus
a discrimination was made which was unfair to the
public and onerous to those upon whom the injustice
'â  fell. From the nature of the proposition made to The
! Call it is fair to assume that when the express com
'â  pany took shipments from large shippers and agreed
to pay the tax it took whole wagon-loads of packages
and lumped them together and put but one stamp
upon the receipt.
Bad as these offenses are, however, they are but r\
minor part of the comprehensive tax-shirking of the
corporations. As a rule express companies have re
-1 quired the public, to pay the taxes which the law im
! poses upon the companies themselves. The issue has
; been taken to the courts time and again in many States
and the decisions have been against the claims of the
corporations, but nevertheless they have continued
to rob the public day after day until the aggregate of
the sums extorted now amounts to millions of dollars.
When Congress undertakes the revision of the law
: care should be taken to put an end to such tax
j shirking as that which has been exposed. The Con
. gressmen from this State will be expected to insist
. upon that point. The people of California are weary
of being robbed by tax-shirkers. The language of
the law should be freed from ambiguities and made
, clear beyond the possibility of a legal quibble. More
, I over, a heavy penalty should be imposed upon the
i j corporation that undertakes to evade the law and
. shirk the tax. The issue will be one of the most im
portant to be dealt with at the coming session, and
, the delegation from California should stand as a unit
; i for the people and the Government against the
I I shirkers.

BY JOHN McNfIUGHT.
Maurice Grau is reported to have
stated in a recent interview in London
that he would like to have grand operas
sung in English for the reason that
they would be more thoroughly enjoyed
by American and English audiences;
yet it is impossible to do so.
"It is all right in theory," he said,
"but it is not all right in practice. When
you come to sift the objections you get
down finally to just one, and that is
that the artists, as a rule, don't wish to
sing in English. Some of them, of
course, can't speak English, but that
doesn't matter so much when you come
to consider that Plancon, for instance,
sings an entire opera in admirable Ger
man without being able to speak a sin
gle word of that language in conversa
tion. It isn't the difficulty of acquiring
English, but it seems to be an objection
to the language itself. I dare say that
if we were to ask Mine. Nordica, an
American, born in Maine, to sing grand
opera in English she would object. So,
doubtless, would lime. Eames and all
the other singers whose native tongue
is English. It doesn't appear to be so
much that English is hard to sing as it
is that it is considered beneath an art
ist's dignity to sing grand opera in
English. They seem to feel that it
would be somehow a degradation."
Inasmuch as there are a good many
men and women who are just as nice
folks if not as fine singers as Eames,
Nordlca and the rest, who do sing
grand opera in English without being
degraded, it is evident there is some
thing wrong with the Grau theory.
Grand opera in English brings about 50
cents an orchestra stall, while in any
other language it brings $5 a gallery
seat and becomes a social function.
That may have much to do with the
problem. It doesn't degrade the artists,
but it lowers the prices, and that is
enough to make any high-souled devo
tee to the most spiritual of arts quaver
in the voice and give forth raucous
tones.
â¢ â¢ *
It is quite within the limits of prob
ability that one of the reasons why
gifted singers with heaven-sent voices
scorn to sing grand opera in English is
because there is no fit translation of the
words. I have never studied the Eng
lish libretto of a grand opera, and
therefore cannot speak with certainty
on the subject; but lately I have had
occasion to note the English version of
the German of some of Schubert's
songs, and have found ample cause to
believe that English versions of opera
must be something that could be safely
recommended to kill cats.
In one. of Schubert's songs, "Auf dem
Flusse," the poet addresses a frozen
river whose current is hidden under
thick ice. The translation in Paver's
edition of the songs contains this gem
of a verse:
As still as death you seem;
A hard substantial flooring
Is laid down overhead.
And motionless and dreary
Lies on the sand outspread.
Now, what singer in the wide world
could pour forth his emotions in song
through the medium of such a bill of
specifications as that calling for a
"hard, substantial flooring, laid down
overhead"? I waive the question of
putting the floor overhead where the
ceiling ought to be, and submit the
proposition solely upon its aptness to
incline any rational creature to sing it.
â¢ â¢ *
"Retrospect" is one of Schubert's
songs in which the poetry in the Ger
man is finest and best. It opens with
an outburst of passion in which the
singer declares that his impatience and
his eagerness to hasten away from a
town of misfortune are such that al
though his path is through Ice and snow
yet his feet burn. In the English ver
sion the song begins more like the wall
of a tramp than the rage of a poet:
With broken boots fresh anguish causing
My burning feet press ice and snow.
It is not worth while to pursue the
theme. "When the burning impatience
of a lover's flying feet is turned into
the anguish caused by broken boots it
is time to abandon translation and stick
to the original. It is, indeed, even bet
ter to return to our own native, true,
American minstrelsy and give utterance
in melody to the fervor and beauty of
such words as these:
Baby don't go and leave me,
You know It's gwine to grieve me.
Hold mo tight, I lub you, baby mine.
Don't want a cent of sugar,
Don't want no other nigger.
When you linger by my side
It's honey all the time.

We must go East to learn what is go
ing on in San Francisco and get a clear
Insight into the motives that cause the
going. The Filipino village at the Me
chanics' Fair affords an illustration of
the dear old truth. In this city we may
believe the Filipinos were brought here
partly to enable us to see what a Fili
pino is like and partly to furnish a
novel attraction for the fair. In the
East they have a far higher wisdom
than that. The Washington corre
spondent of the Philadelphia Public
Ledger informs his paper that the Gov
ernment has been notified that the Fili
pinos were brought here for political
effect. He says they are of a very low
order of Intelligence, extremely careless
in the matter of cleanliness, and adds:
"It is believed that the real object in
bringing these degraded specimens of
humanity to this country is to show
what a maps of ignorance and savagery
the United States has become respons
ible for, and that the result would be
the creation of a sentiment against
keeping the Philippines."
To that statement there is hardly any
repartee possible except to say to
Washington, Philadelphia and the
whole East: "You are another."
â¢ â¢ *
It is not only the Filipino in sight in
this country that disturbs the imperial
ist, for the Filipino out of sight in his
own tropical paradise is about as irri
tating. In fact, there are some Eastern
jinpoes who believe the Filipino is a
kissing bug. A correspondent of the
New York Sun thus pictures the enemy:
"The whole campaign illustrates some
features of the situation in the Philip
pines admirably. WÂ« are fighting a
reckless, irresponsible enemy who can
scatter his men like scared chickens at
will whenever he is pressed too closely.
When we think we have him com
pletely demoralized and ready to give
up he takes advantage of the slightest
lapse of vigilance on our part to gather
his robed-in-the-garments-of-peace sol
diers together again and give us a
whack. By the time we can gather our
selves up to wipe him off the face of the
earth he is back in the garments of
peace again, and we can't find him."
It la to be hoped the Philadelphia
Ledger and the Washington authorities
vfrll give attention to that statement of
the Sun. A race of people whose sol
diers when slaughtered one day on the
field of battle rise next day in the gar
ments of peace and on the third day are
ready to fight again is certainly a race
worth putting on exhibition. In fact,
the sight of a single one of them is
worth the price of admission. This is
the time for Eastern tourists to come
West and see our show.
In these days a new form of political
jobbery is about as hard to invent as
was anew pleasure in the days when |
Sardanapalus offered a province to any
man who would devise one. Neverthe
less a novel job has been forthcoming,
and Pennsylvania is the land of its tri
umph. The State Zoologist of that good
State wrote a small treatise on the dis
eases and enemies of poultry. When
printed it formed a pamphlet of less
than 100 pages. He submitted it to the
Legislature as a work which should be
in every household, and the legislators,
believing him and seeing no harm in a
poultry pamphlet, nor suspecting any
In a zoologist, authorized its publication
by the State "with such alterations and
additions a-s the author should see fit to
make." The author saw fit to make a
good many. His little pamphlet ex
panded to a volume of 749 pages. The
courts were appealed to in vain. The |
act authorizing the book is valid, and
it must be published even though it
rakes the treasury.
In its expanded form the work seems
to be a treatise on universal knowledge,
with special adaptability for use in pub
lic schools. One critic says of it:
"Without doubt the volume is worth
an extended review if only because it is
an example of probably one of the most
barefaced perversions of the plain in
tent of an act ever presented in the his
tory of the State. There are a few col
ored plates illustrating diseases of poul
try, and there are upward of 100 pictur
ing birds, mammals and wild birds'
eggs. There are numerous half-tone
pictures Illustrating picturesque spots
in Pennsylvania and of men dressed in
grass gunning suits. There is a two
page story pathetically describing how
twelve ducklings belonging to a 'cross j
old hen, who scolded' because her fos- !
ter offspring took to the water, disap
peared one by one in the most mysteri
ous manner; how several innocent cats
were suspected and shot; how a faithful
pointer was beaten and tied up for the j
same reason; how a boy was held under
surveillance because of a belief that he ,
was the guilty one, and how a snapping ;
turtle was finally found to be the crim
inal by a 'sturdy son of Vulcan 1 ; how
the dog was released from imprison
ment and signalized his joy by half kill
ing a favorite kitten belonging to "an j
old maid'; how the boy was petted, and j
how, in fact, all were made happy ex- j
cept the poor, slaughtered cats, whose
bodies were used as fertilizers for some
grapevines which needed rich nourish- !
ment. There are other stories scattered j
through the book which may be consid- j
ered very entertaining even though
they have little relation to diseases of
poultry."
One would suppose an official having
such small opportunities as fall to the
lot of a zoologist, who could make a J
coup of that kind, would be at once
placed upon a pedestal as a standing
candidate for higher honors, but such
public favor has not been awarded him.
He has been forced by the clamors of |
an unlearned populace to resign his of
fice, and is now tormented by inquiries
from librarians as to whether his book
should be catalogued under the classifi
cation of agriculture, ornithology,
mammalogy, ichthyology or general
sports.

From the designs submitted for the
buildings of the University of California
it is evident the competing architects
took our large words literally. We said
we desired the biggest thing on the j
globe, and they prepared their designs j
accordingly. Such superb masses of
architecture have not been seen since
the days of the Caesars. One enrap
tured gazer upon the plans said to an
other: "What do you think?" and the
other responded: "I think I should like
to live to see the last building of either '
set completed."
The vastness of each structure de
vised for carrying out the vaster plan
of the stupendous whole has staggered
the general public. We expected some
thing that would surpass Stanford, and
we have received something into which
all Stanford could be placed and lost to I
sK r lit, remaining not even to memory
dear. If we make a stagger at accom
plishing such a marvelous aggregate
of palaces in our present mood it will
be something like a case of blind stag
gers. For the moment we are "beat,"
and feel much like the peasant to whom
the rajah gave the elephant.
Fortunately for us, the human mind
grows up to the level of whatever it
contemplates with a sincere aspiration.
Magnificent as the plans are, they are
in truth none too magnificent for Cali
fornia. They present to us an Ideal of
architectural beauty, and it is now our
duty to live up to it. Something like a
fortune will be required to construct a
single one of the principal edifices of
either of the designs, and it is not likely
any Legislature will vote a sufficient
appropriation for it. We must rely
upon the munificence of millionaires,
and I, for one, believe the reliance will
not be in vain. At any rate, we have
started out upon a big venture, and
something monumental will come of it
even if it be no more than a bust.
In commenting last week upnn the
fact that the Eastern press in referring
to university education in this State
nearly always speaks of Stanford an>l
Ignores Berkeley as if it were not, I
said unless something be done promptly
to advertise Berkeley the report of the
great architectural designs would be re
garded in the East as the announce
ment of an annex to Stanford's family
monument. That was Intended for ex
aggeration, but there is many a true
word spoken when we do not intend it.
On one of the designs for the new build
ings there is laid out a broad thorough
fare through the grounds, and it is
marked "Stanford avenue."
It is to be hoped the people of
California will grapple in earnest with
the noble task that has been set them
at Berkeley. It is certainly an inspiring
one, for superb architecture more pro
foundly affects the imagination than
any other art. It appeals strongly to
all that is greatest in the human mind,
and accordingly kings and conquerors
and all men of vast ambitions have
been great builders. Nations that have
cherished high Ideals of grandeur,
whether Imperial or republican, have
shared with their aspiring leaders the
delight In magnificent structures. The
turbulent freemen of old Rome yielded
a more willing submission to the rule
of Augustus Caesar because he trans
formed their city of brick into a city
of marble and made it truly majestic.
Napoleon won the people O f artistic
Paris by adorning that city with
new palaces and stately monuments,
and in our own country even so
vulgar a leader as Boss Tweed
long held the favor of the voters
of New York by reason of the elaborate
works he undertook in the way of.
splendid public buildings and park dec
orations.
"Man," said Cicero, "never work 3so
like a god as in the building of a na
tion." Now, the spirit that animates a
people to make a great commonivMiih
can best manifest itself in artistic
forms through the medium of architec
ture. To that art all others except rriu
3ic are accessory and subordinate. A
generous, patriotic woman, through a
happy inspiration, has given us an
impetus toward a genuinely noble
achievement in architecture and has
furnished us with the best designs
for its attainment the skill and the
genius of our age can provide. Ii
remains to be seen how we will respond
to the leadership. California holds a
proud pre-eminence in the Union by
reason of the grandeur of h^r scenery.
Shall we now add to her glory a tri
umph of architecture not unworthy of
the land of Yosemite, of Tahoe and of
Shasta?

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, SEPTEMBER 10. 1899.
PLEASURE AND
MIRTH HELD A
HAPPY CROWD
St. Brigid's Was a
Success.
CHURCH FUND ENLARGED
VERY LARGE ATTENDANCE AT
SCHUETZEN PARK.
Jigs and Reels to the Tune of a Jbively
Fiddle â Valuable Prizes for
Twenty Racing Events
Awarded.
The reunion of St. Brigid's parishioners
at Schuetzen Park yesterday was a suc
anancially as well as socially. The
early boats for Tiburon were crowded,
and even as late as 3 o'clock In the day
new arrivals swelled the number until It
reached nearly 1500. That every one had a
good time was apparent from the happy
t'aoes in all parts of the grounds, and to
Father M. P. Kyan is duo much credit
i for the general enjoyment. J. H. Scanlan
I and Charles McCarthy were also very
much In evidence in the matter of attend
; ing to the wants of the picnickers.
Business to a certain extent was com
i blued with pleasure, for all of the pro
ceeds from the sale of tickets, wheel of
â  fortune, etc., are to be donated to the fund
: for building the new church on Van Ness
avenue, and there was not a stingy hand
i in the crowd.
"While the majority found amusement on
the dancing floor of Captain Schuemann's
1 big pavilion, many others sought recrea
tion among the trees, where they partook
! of their lunches. Others still wooed for
tune at the Brownie wheel, over which
mas Butterworth presided like an old
, hand at the business, and not a few of
â  those who hailed from the old sod shook
! their heels on the dancing platform in
; jig and reel to the tune of a riddle. Ofh
j cer Kreegan was among the latter, and
i none had more fun in this line than he.
i Even the dignity of his uniform did not
â¢ prevent him from "dancing down" many
; a good-looking lady and lass.
The clergy were present and the pleas
, ure of their members was in making all
arouii'l them happy. Prominent were
Key. Father John E. Cottle, the pastor;
Rev. Father M. I. Ryan and Rev. Father
ph Byrne. To their credit be it said
| they objected to the sale of intoxi
cating liquors on the grounds, and their
wishes were observed to the letter, with
3ponding beneficial results. One
â¢ most attractive features of he oc
cation was the races for old and young,
and for the twenty odd events there were

Weltmerism, That Method of Magnetic Healing Which Cures All Dis-
eases Without the Aid of Medicine or the Surgeon's Knife.
Will Stand as an Imperishable Monument to Science Whan All Other
Curative Powers Have Passed Into Oblivion,
A MINISTER OF THE GOSPEL'S MARVELOUS WORK,
i
This Is a scientific age wherein the Goddess of ,
Reason, like a Falcon of Light, showers her !
bright rays of sunshine and happiness into j
places heretofore kept dark by ignorance, de- '
stroylng both superstition and fear. In this !
great progressive age no man has done more j
for the uplifting of humanity than has Prof. I
S. A. Weltmer, of Nevada, Mo., by his Intel- j
lectual Investigations and scientific researches. ;
This eminent scientist has perfected a method
of Masnetic Healing known as Weltmerlsm,
Which has proved beyond the shadow of a doubt
that disease and aftiictions of all kinds can be
cured without the aid of cither drags or the i
surgeon's knife. He has gone further with his
Investigations into the Science of Health than
has any other man known to humanity. It is
hard for us to comprehend that right in our
very midst there is a man who has originated
a method which at once makes itself master
over the domain of disease. This wonderful
man began life in poverty, with nothing but
hiF own intellect to mukr himself a place in
the world. When he had scarcely stepped upon
the threshold of manhood he had already en-
tered the ministry. After preaching the gospel
for a number of years, throuKh hl B scientific
researches he found himself in the most en-
viable position over hÂ«ld by a scientistâ that of
being humanity's greatest benefactor. The
method known as the Absent Treatment, which
cures the patient at a distance Just as readily
hs though the patient had traveled to Nevada,
Mo., for treatment, makes it possible for Welt-
nierism to cure all classes of people, in this
way making it the greatest boon that man has

Ing Power of Love" is the title of Mr.

against Elliot and his brother. The
shooting happened in the Young Amer
ica saloon kept by Knippenberg and
came without any provocation or warn- '
ing. The most remarkable incident at- '
tending it was the fact that the pro
prietor of the house did not know that
he had been shot until nearly an
hour after the bullets ceased to fly and
: whet) he had been taken to his home.
About 5:30 o'clock yesterday after
noon George Elliot, his brother, Fred X.
Elliot, and William Hodgera were
; standing at the bar in Knippenberg's
saloon. Knippenberg and a bartender,
! Herman Deitrich, were serving them
' drinks. Both of the Elliot boys were
employed as teamsters for the Simp
son Lumber Company and Hodgers is
: the secretary of the Thompson Bridge
Company. The trio chatted with the
! proprietor for some time and were
about to leave when Robert L. Hunt,
I an acquaintance, also employed by the
; Simpson Lumber Company, made his
â  appearance at the door. He offered no
i salutation, but immediately pulled a
revolver from his pocket and com
menced shooting while the men's backs
â  were toward him.
Excitement prevailed immediately.
Two bullets came from Hunt's revolver
in quick succession. After the first had
been fired George Elliot was seen to
, stagger and fall. The murderer is sup
jiosr-d to have intended the second for
! Fred Elliot, but it failed to find its in
tended victim. Instead it possibly
fatally wounded E. K. Knippenberg, the
proprietor, who was behind the bar.
When Hunt had discharged two
; chambers of his revolver he backed up
to the door, and. pointing the gun in
the direction of the ceiling, fired again.
He then stepped into the street and
emptied his revolver into the air. When
the last shot had been fired the man
threw out the empty cartridges and
started across the street. Police Officer
Caster of the Harbor Police Station had
'â  been attracted by the shots and ob
served Hunt's movements. He con
cealed himself in a doorway and waited
i for the man with the gun to pass by.
When he approached him the officer
seized him and took away the pistol.
With his prisoner Officer Caster
started back for the scene of the trag-
I edy. He found .that Elliot was dead,
the bullet having entered his back,
passing entirely through , his body.
KnlDPenberg was sitting on a chair
unfastening one of his shoes.
'Are you also shot?" asked the of
ficer.
Knippenberg replied that he was
not, and his bartender also gave the
officer the same assurance. The pro
; prietor says that his leg became numb
Immediately after the shooting and
, that he fell to the floor. He believed
that he had struck his leg on something
and thought little of the matter at
lirst. Finally the pain and numbness
! increased and he called a hack and
: was taken to his home. Upon his ar
-1 rival there he discovered that a bullet
j had entered his body Just below the
' right nipple. Dr. Kearney was called
| and pronounced the wound so serious
; that he advised the saloon-keeper to
make his will.
How Knippenberg received his
i wound, without experiencing any pain
except in his leg. is a perplexing prob
: lem. Every person who was a specta
i tor to thf tragedy was surprised when
he learned that a second person had
been struck, and all agree in the asser
tion that the second bullet fired by
Hunt must have been- the one which
wounded Knippenberg. At a late hour
I last night the wounded man was sink
ing, and from reports given out by the
family it is doubtful whether he will
I recover. At a late hour he was uncort-
I sclous and the bullet had not been lo
cated.
Hunt, who did the shooting, -was
formerly employed by the lumber com
pany. After his arrest he was taken to
the City Prison and displayed every ev
idence of insanity. His father called at
i the Morgue and stated that the de

merited man had been Injured on the
head by a falling roof about four years
ago, and that since that time he has
not been responsible for his actions.
He shows no contrition for his crime,
and says that if he had the chance he
â would murder a few more people. He
implicates the Elliot brothers in a lone
line of mythical family troubles, and
kept the prisoners around him awake
all night with his ravings. He made
the following statement for publication,
which shows just how eccentric the
fellow is:
"I went to the saloon," he said, "with
a fixed determination to shoot Elliot. I
waited there a short time, when he ap
peared, accompanied by his brother. I
quickly arose, and, drawing my re
volver, shot him in the back. As he
turned he cried 'Oh, Bobby!' I then
fired a second shot, and he fell mor
tally wounded. I waited till the police
officer arrived and was taken into cus
tody. I am glad I killed him, and I
now want to be hanged for my crime.
How pleased I would be to have my
friends sco me on the gallows with a
rope amund my neck. My soul is gone,
and without it I cannot live. About
two years ago I became acquainted
with Elii<>t while I was in tho employ
of Simpson, the well-known lumber
merchant. Ellim knew me well and up
to within a few days aso I had no hard
feelings against him. They thought me
crazy while in the employ of Simpson,
and I was forced to resign my position.
"I wont to Tacoma. and after work
ing there for some time, traveled to
Portland. I tried to join the Salvation
Army at the latter place, but for some
reason they refused to accept my an
llcation. Tired ;md worn out and know
ing that Elliot was my relentless
enemy, I returned to San Francisco two
days ago determined to wreak ven
geance upon him. I have been in the
habit of carrying a revolver, and with
my trusted weapon I started out last
night to kill Elliot. Knowing that he
was in the habit of visiting the saloon
where th^ Bhooting took place, I sat
down and waited his coming. Just as
he and his brother appeared, I waited
until his back was turned and then
fired. I am glad I killed him, but I
am sorry I did not shoot myself. How
ever, I hourly await the time when I
am to expiate my crime on. the gal
lows."
The police are convinced that Hunt
is mentally deranged. To-day he will
be taken before the Commissioners of
Insanity and be examined as to his
mental condition.
Elliot resided at 91" Hampshire street,
had been married for six years and
had three children. He was a man
highly respected by all who knew him
and enjoyed the utmost confidence of
his employers.
NEIGHBORS IN DEATH.
Two Old Residents of DeLong
Avenue Commit Suicide.
Two suicides, both old men, one of them
residing at 110 De Long avenue and the
other living at 111 De Long avenue, were
reported to the Morgue yesterday. It is
I not believed that the suicide of one had
| any connection with the suicide of the
t other, but the fact that the two men aro
favorably known In the locality where
they lived, besides being lifelong friends.
makes a story a little out of the ordinary.
Poverty and despondency were the causes
cf both acts.
At 6 o'clock yesterday morning A. King,
i aged 4S years and residing at 111 De Long
! avenue, left home and went to Golden
I Gate Park. He has been despondent for
some time owing to the fact that he bus
I been out of work, and has complained
much of the circumstances which have
been against him. At 1:45 p. m. he blew
out his brains near the Lincoln monu
ment with a 3S-caliber revolver and died
instantly. Captain Thompson of th^ park
police notified the Coroner and deputies
immediately took charge of the case.
King was married, and just before he
; took his life he scrawled this note:
I am going insane. My head.
Deceased was a member of Friendship
Lodge Nc. 17!Â», A. O. U. W.
Harry Foley, aged 45 years and residing
. at the first of the two addresses Â«iven

â  in a bathroom connected with nis honifl
at 5:30 yesterday afternoon. He had
turned the stopper on a gas jet used un
der a cooking stove, and closing all of the
doors and windows prepared for dcaih.
When tbe neighbors entered the house
lie was breathing his last, and the effort*
of Dr. Spencer, who was called, were in
vain. Deceased was employed with the
Schmidt Lithographing Company for many
years, but recently had been out of \vnrk
and had grown despondent. He left a
wife and son. the latter being about 2J
years of ago. He was also a native son

SHE LOVED HER
FIRST HUSBAND
BEST OF ALL
Mrs. Smith, Despond
ent, Kills Herself.
Because Mrs. Pauline M. Smith found
marriage to be a failure in her case, and
because she loved her first husband, she
sent a pistol bullet through her brain
early yesterday morning while her second
husband lay sleeping by her side. Her
second husband is T. N. Smith, who, it is
said, has amass) 1 considerable money in
the liquor business.
From the story told by Mr. Smith it
would appear that the dead woman had
fretted over her separation from her di
vorced hubband until she became disgust
ed with life.
Smith married the deceased in Portland,
Or., about eleven months ago, after she
had been divorced from William Hull.
After ncr marriage to Smith she continued
to visit Hull at his ofll<.e, and Smith pro
tested. She explained that Hull was mak
ing collections lor her and attending to
her business affairs, and -Smith replied
That he was competent to manage her af
i lairs and did not like the idea of her go
! ing to see her ex-husband even on busi-
I ness. Mrs. Smith thereupon requested
him to take her away from Portland, as
she thought that If she kept away from
that city the would be able to forget Hull.
In pursuance of her request the couple
paid a visit to this city about three
months ago and made a call upon Mrs.
W. M. Kretz, a niece of Mrs. Smith, liv
ing on Fair Oaks street. Mrs. Smith be
came so favorably impressed with this
city that she prevailed upon her husband
to buy her a little home. He bought a
small place, but she became tired or it,
and he sold it and purchased the furni
ture, of a flat at 9111% Mission street.
Through all these changes the unfor
tunate woman pined for her home in
Portland. It had become endeared to her
because of its associations and the pleas
ant memories connected with the man
trom whom she had been divorced. Her
husband saw that she was not contented
here, and when she expressed a desire to
return to Portland he readily agreed. He
sold the furniture to Simon Schlweck, a
dealer, and on Friday Smith drew all their
money out of the bank, yesterday being a
holiday, so that they might leave for Port
land on the next day.
On Friday night they went to the Olym
pia beer hall and had about four glasses
of beer, returning home and retiring at
half an hour after midnight. Mrs. Smith
was somewhat depressed in spirits, but
did not -say nor do anything to lead him
to suspect that she contemplated self
destruction. . Before retiring she placed
a loaded revolver on a small i;ible at the
head of the bed as a protection against
burglars, all the money and jewelry of
the couple being in the house. Smith said
that he did not carry a revolver and that
the weapon belonged to his wife.
"She was a very daring woman," he
added, when he told his story to Coroner
Hill.
At about a quarter before 6 clock in
the morning Hie husband was awakened
, by a noise that sounded like a pistol shot,
but his slumber was so profound that he
i did not realize what had happened. As
I soon as he awoke he placed his right arm

BRAND NEW SOCIETY
OF AMERICAN WARS
THE Commandery of the State of Cal
ifornia, Society of American Wars
of the United States, was informally
Instituted yesterday. The meeting
of the members was held in the parlors
of the Palace Hotel, among those present
being David Starr Jordan, W. A. Ander
son, H. G. Stevenson, Arthur Crosby, Cap
tain Henry Glass, Commander Charles W.
Rae, Professor Elmer E. Brown, Professor
Charles K. Babcock, Dr. Philip K. Broa-n
and Arthur J. Edwards. The total mem
bership in Caiifornia is about sixty.
The meeting was called to order by
President David Starr Jordan, vice com
mander general of the national society,
who spoke briefly of the aims of the so
ciety and explained that the present meet
ing was preliminary to the formal organ
ization of the commandery, which will
take place about the middle of Oc f nber.
Dr. Jordan explained that the society was
historical an genealogical in its purposes,
that the men who have held positions of
trust during the formation of- the colonies
and of the United States, and who have
taken part in the wars that have been
waged by the United States, were a
picked class of men, and that to their de
scendants this distinction has descended
and their memory should be preserved.
He then spoke further, explaining that
the Society of American Wars was insti
tuted by Edward Junius Edwards Janu
ary 11, 1897, for perpetuating among their
descendants the memory of the men who
were Instrumental in establishing the colo
nies of North America and were founders
of this nation; of the men who achieved
American independence, and of the men
who in military and naval positions of
trust assisted in the preservation of tha
republic in the 15*12, Mexican and Civil
wars; collecting for preservation docu
ments relating to those periods; providing
suitable commemorations of the prominent
events connected with those periods, and
Inspiring in Its companions the fraternal
and patriotic spirit of their forefathers.
After this Introduction the society pro
ceeded to the election of officers. Captain
Henry Glass, U. S. N., was elected com
mander and Arthur Jordan Edwards of
Stanford University was made recorder.
Captain Glass then took the chair, and
the details of the preliminary organization
were completed. It was decided to hold
the formal Institution of the commandery
and the banquet on the evening of Tues
day, October 17, in commemoration of
the surrender of Burcoyne. at Saratoga
during the War of the Revolution. After
a discussion of the details of the banquet
the meeting adjourned.
The Society of American Wars Is a pa
triotic society, formed along the same
general lines as the Society of the Cin
cinnati, the Society of Colonial Wars
and Sons of the Revolution, where the
around her, she being on the outside of
the bed, and his hand touched the re
volver. It was clutched in her right
hand. He found that she had shot her
self through the right temple.
The other inmates were alarmed and
Dr. Margaret Mahoney was summoned,
but medical aid was of no avail, for the
woman had killed herself instantly.
Mrs. Schmidt, who occupies the lower
flat, and Mrs. Kretz. the niece of the dead
woman, informed Coroner Hill yesterday
that Mrs. Smith had frequently declared
that she intended to shoot herself.
An inquest will be held at 9 o'clock to
morrow morning.
Mrs. Smith was born In Germany thirty
nine years ago.
VICTIM OF MORPHINE.
Henry Behrens Gives Up the
Fight to Control an Evil
Habit.
Henry Behrens, residing at 305 Minna
Street, committed suicide by taking an
overdose of morphine yesterday. He has
been a confirmed morphine user for the
past year, and the fact that he has not
been able to rid himself of the habit drove
him to suicide. He left several letters, of
which the following Is the most interest-
Ing:
Anna: No doubt this win surprlce you. Grant
me two wishesâ you and Mary. First, do not
weep, do not sorrow for me one second â Mary
the same. Ever since I saw that the end was
my only hope, and If you could see how easy it
Is, you would say, "No wonder he wanted to
go." Second, forgive me. I have struggled
with might and main as lons as there was one
spark of hopp. I swear this. I have no fear
whatever may be hereafter, for I can say I
have done my very best. And to any man who
is on this same road I would gay do not try
to turn back. You will only suffer the most
ungodly torture for nothing. I wish you all
the good I can possibly think of. Good-by to
you all. I have spent my last dollar. I pray
you do not spend one cent on me. Let the city
take care of me. I pray you don't let it bother
you. Do not give my case a second thought.
HENRY.
The suicide was a laborer, aged 40 years
and single. He died at about 6 o'clock
yesterday evening. His body was taken
to the Morgue, where an Inquest will be
held. -

PET TABBY FEEDS
ON STUFFED BIRDS
ALMA E. KEITH'S CAT DOES
GREAT DAMAGE.
It Gains Access to a Show "Window
and Destroys Several Hundred Dol
lars' Worth of Headgear.
A Maltese cat last nifrht wrought de
struction among the hats in Alma Keith's
millinery establishment at SOS Market
street. The cat is a pet of Mrs. Keith's,
and was never before known to be partial
to stuffed birds. At 10 o'clock last night
Mrs. Ki -it h closed her establishment and
prepared to go home. Shortly after she
departed several citizens who were pass
ing the store discovered the milliner's cat
in a show window, destroying the birds
thru ornamented a number of expensive
hats. They vainly endeavored to chase
the feline away from the window, but it
continued its work of destruction. At
midnight the cat had succeeded in ruin
ing at least a dozen hats. Policeman Tom
Murphy, after rapping on the show win
dow with his club and failing to drive the
cat away, drew his revolver, intending to
shoot the mischievous pet. Just as he
raised his revolver to shoot he thought of
the damage that would result from the
bullet, and he concluded, after replacing
his pistol in his pocket, to summon Mrs.
Keith.
Another officer was hastily dispatched
to her house, and notified her of the de
struction wrought by her cat. She quickly
repaired to the store, and was amazed on
looking into the show window to find a
number of expensive hats destroyed.
Stuffed birds, some with their heads gone
and others with their feathers missing,
wore found scattered about the show win
dow. The vicious cat was found in a
corner of the show window, feasting on a
cockatoo. Mrs. Keith estimates her loss
through the viciousness of the cat at sev
eral hundred dollars.

COLMA IS CHECKED
Timely Expose Has Forced the
Schemers to Hesitate.
Decent People of San Mateo County Demand Protection
From the Social Scnm of the Poolrooms and
Vice Nests of Thieves and Outcasts.
Died ad- ;
vantage and it is hoped a perma- |
nent victory In the struggle to pre- |
vent the raid of the gamblers and j
their crew of criminal parasites j
upon the little town of Colma. The ex- I
pcÂ«e of The Call was timely. Reputable I
Itizens of San Mateo County came quick- 1
ly to the assistance of the people of Col
ma. An opposition, emphatic and aggres
sive, to the impudent scheme of the book- |
making blacklegs was formed, and last j
night the- gamblers found it expedient not {
to call their announced meeting and pe
tition the Supervisors"of San Mateo to au
thorize a special election on the subject
of incorporation. The publicity given to
their outrageous plan has driven the
schemers temporarily to their holes. That
they will try aeain there is no question.
but for the present they want no special
session of the Supervisors and they have
no petition to present.
They intend to wait until the indigna
tlon and excitement of the people of the
â whole county as well as of Colma has
subsided and then they will try again.
But they will be carefully watched. The
people of San Mateo County do not wish
to stain their official records with storiea i
of crime and dishonor, shame and death.
Theyiwaht no legalized nest of blacklegs
and thieves, depraved men and worse
women. They do not wish to place before
their sons the hazard of dishonor and
before their daughters the temptation
that ends in shame. The reputable ele
ments of the entire county ire behind
the decent citizens of Colma In their en
deavors to prevent the outrage.
The Supervisors are opposed to it and
will exercise their orScial power to pre
vent it. All classes of men, who have
anything of decency at stake, are in vio
lent antagonism to it. Merchants, pro
fessional men, lawyers, clergymen, arti
sans are as one in declaring that the in
corporation of Coima as a town under
the direction and within the control of
thieves, blacklegs and confidence men
would be a blow to the county and an in-
Jury that years of effort could not repair.
The attempt of the gamblers to Incor
porate Colma as a town is. in its impu
dence, without parallel in the history of
California. It means nothing more or
less thafl an effort of blacklegs to seize
a town of the State and to conduct It as
a gambling hell with all its attendant
evils. Against the earnest protest of the
people of the town, against the best in
terests of the county, in opposition to the
rlsrhrs of citizens, a horde of thieves,
gambler? roustabouts and social out
casts purpose to establish a community
cf evil under the protection of the law 3.
There is little wonder that the expose
of The Call fired the decent people with
indignation and made the gamblers hunt
a speedy, retirement. When Bob Thorn
ton'went to Colma. yesterday afternoon i

A Grocer's Interest Is to Fur-
nish Pure Food.
â¢ tK?r-
takÂ»s in the a i of 1 Â»h he
: . !
Some people believe that the grocer '
Is influenced only by the profit he may i
derive, and that his recommendations j
are governed entirely by a mercenary
motive, but this is xuji always true. On
th<? contrary. It is believed that a ma- j
Jority of the tter class of grocers are :
thoroughly honest in their desire to
furnish their patrons with really pure '
and nourishing food.
The following from John Wallsrren. a
prominent grocer of Portland. Oregon.
may be of Interest: "I am on my tenth
case of Grape-Nuts, and my trade is
still increasing. I have been bothered i
â with a weak stomach for flve years. I j
have tried a number of remedies and i
patent medicines without help. I am
eating- Grape-Nuts three times a day.
and after using three packages I must
admit that I am relieved of mv weak
stomach and feel like a new man."
There is a reason for this. A weak
stomach can take Grape-Nuts and di- \
g-est them without difficulty, for Grape-
Nuts are actually pre-dlgested and
ready 5 for immediate transformation
Into rich blood and good strong tissue,
both of muscle and brain. They are
generally admitted to be the most
scientifically made food in the world,
in which the starch of th- cereals Is
transformed Into gTape sugar and this
Is done without the use of any sort of
drug or acid whatsoever. On the con-
trary, all of the processes are purely
mechanical. using simply moisture,
time (in which to grow the diastase)
and heat, but the work of the human
system Is copied almost exactly, with
the result that the food is ready for
Immediate assimilation.
The flavor is exquisite and delicate,
the sweet of gTape sugar can be de- |
tected. The food is absolutely free
from cane or beet sugar, but the fine.
almost microscopic, particles of grape
sugar can be seen glistening on the
surface of the small granules. Grape- ,
Nuts with cream furnishes the most .
delicious breakfast food in existence,
and this food Is in use now by practi-
cally all of the well-to-do families In ;
America. The demand has been so
great that the factory has been running
steadily both night and day for up- I
ward of a year, and the fame of the
American breakfast dish tas spread to
many of the other countries of the
world. '
house had been prepared for the meeting
and the resolutions of petition were
ready, but there was opposition In the
air. The substantial people of the town
and the farmers of the district had seen
that the promised benefits of incorpora
tion were fictitious, and that only a har
vest of evil was to be won by the com
ing: of the gamblers.
They were united, therefore, in oppo
sition, and intended to go to the pro
posed meeting to fight. Thornton, as
the emissary of Chris Buckley and his
allied gamblers, found it best to hes'tate.
The field was anything but promising.
The campaign of deceit had failed of its
purpose, and the people of Colma were
thoroughly informed. Thornton held a
consultation with Assemblyman Henry
Ward Brown, and they decided that it
would be wise to be cautious and post
pone the meeting. Brown has acted
as chairman of the meetings already
held and was perfectly willing to do so
again were it not for the publicity given
to the affair.
So the meeting was not held. A gang
of roustabouts, uninformed on the turn
affairs had taken, had assembled, but
they were sent back to the city. Thorn
ton announced that as the day was a le
gal holiday It would be unwise to draft
a petition. This absurd proposition was
taken for what it was worth, and Thorn
ton will now confer with his superiors as
to what shall be the next move. Mean
while the people of Ban Mateo shall main
tain their vigilance to prevent a raid that
would mean the most serious Injury to
their best interests.
A SMOOTH SCHEME.
Southern Portion of the County
to Be Kept in Ignorance.
MEXLO PARK. Sept. 9.â The publicity
given by The Call to the scheme of the
gamblers who re trying to get a town
which they can control by the trick of
incorporating 1 Colma is bearing good
fruit. It is not until the whole of San
Mateo County has been traveled over in
search of facts that the smoothness of
the gamblers' still hunt can be fully ap
preciated. Hundreds of voters can be
found in the county who had absolutely
no intimation of the threatened danger
until they read The Call. The conditions
were favorable to the gamblers. The
Beard of Supervisors meets at Redwood
City, far from the people most directly
concerned, and it would peneraUy be safe
to predict that no one from CoLma would
go to Redwood City to attend a board
meeting. If the people of the southern
portion of the cotintj* could have been
kept in ignorance of what was going on.
no one from that section would have been
on hand to protest when a. protest would
be effective. But there is no such general
ignorance now. The electric light has
been turned on, and there are now ener
getic and public-spirited men in every
town In the county who are willing and
anxious to do what they can to prevent
the consummation of the proposed infamy
at Colma.
From the foregoing it should not be In
ferred that the danger is over by any
means. Only the first of the necessary
steps have been taken, this being 1 the
giving of notification to -he public. That
this will lead to organized opposition to
the gamblers is probable. But the fact
remains that there la no organized oppo
sition yetâ only an awakening-. Still much
appears to have been accomplished in a
short time. The Call's representative haa
found men of high standing 1 in their com
munities who will not shrink from prom
inent opposition to the gambling gang.
The several members of the Board of Su
pervisors may be sure that they will have
to face well-informed and angry constitu
encies if they dare to be recreant to the
public welfare in this matter.
Politicians, business men, clergymen
all are amazed that any one should have
the hardihood to propose to make San
Mateo County the dumping around of the
gamblers and their disreputable follow
ing. The Supervisors will not be able to
say that they did not comprehend what
thÂ» proposed incorporation really means,
for sufficient information will come to
them from many sources to make that
plea futile If they should plead a lack of
knowledge.
In this town Rev. Mr. Parsons, the pas
tor of the Episcopal church, to-day prom
ised to see Supervisor McEvoy and talk
the matter over with him. Mr. Parsons
is very strongly opposed to gambling, and
said that he would exert his influence to
prevent an -.-.--â  at Colma. He did
not know whether a petition to the Su
pervisors would be the best . means to
adopt to prevent the turning of Colma
into a gambling town. R might be just
as well to have influence brought to bear
upon each Supervisor in his own district.
He does not believe that there is any re
putable citizen in Ifenio Park who will
favor having a gambling plant at Colma.
E. C. Weingartner. one of the active
business men of Menlo Park, spoke very
energetically about the Colma scheme:
"To make a dumping-ground of San
Mat<=o County for crooks and cutthroats
would be an outrage which I can hardly
believe the Supervisors will assist any one
to perpetrate. Our county board has
generally been a pretty square lot. If Mc-
Evoy should do anything of the sort I
will be very much surprised. The gam
blers would not be of any advantage to
the county. The Colma raxes would be
heavier than they are now. because a
town tax would be added to the State
and county taxes."
Few of the wealthier dwellers at Menlo
were at home to-day. Doubtless they
all will agree with the position of Tim
othy Hopkins, who said and concisely
that he was opposed to any scheme that
would turn Colma into a gamblers' town.
Supervisor McEvoy was In Santa Cruz
all day. M. F. Duft of the old time con
cern of Duff and Doyle, thÂ« largest busi
ness house In the town, said that he cer
tain: was against the gamblers.
President David Starr Jordan of Stan
ford University was interviewed this
morning. He said:
"I do not know any of the facts con
cerning the reported movement that the
gamblers are making for the incorpora
tion of Colma as a town. If the purpose
is to pave the way for the opening of
gambling games at Colma and the en
couragement of gambling, you can say
that I am most emphatically opposed to
any action upon the part of the consti
tuted authorities that can aid anything
of the sort. The poolrooms- everywhere
are evil. San Francisco seems determined
to drive out the gambling element from
Its borders a3 much as possible, and the
legislation already adopted is apparently
attended with excellent results. San Ma
teo County is the seat of culture and en
lightened social life. In my opinion the
county as a whole cannot wish to encour
age ambling. All moral, educational and
social forces ought to be enlisted In op
position to the gambling evil. Stanford
University is not in San Mateo County,
but 'ome of its professors are citizens of
that county and take a lively interest in
its welfare. If the incorporation of Colma
is intended to promote gambling interests
an other interests should be against It."
Rev Mr. M a the Congregational
clergyman at Redwood City, said last
evening that he thought that a petition
to the Supervisors asking the board not
to give the gamblers the chance they
seek at Colma would be well. The fact Is
that no such petition has yet appeared in
the county. While there is a small army
THE SAN FKANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, SEPTEMBER 10, 1599.
of well-disposed voters, no one has taken >
the initiative, at least no one in this er.d j -
of the county. If the gamblers file the
only paper on the subject to come before
the Supervisors the advantage will be all
with them.
James G. Mason, the agent of vV ells- ;
Fargo at Menlo. said to-day that he ,
strongly objected to having the gambler? j
carry their point at Colma. The county i
has had a good name. It would be dis- j
graceful If the evil should be Inflicted on â 
the Colma people, who would suffer in
many ways.
PROBABLE INTIMIDATION
Suspicious Lack of Interest at
San Mateo.
SAN MATEO. Sept. The nearer
Colma Is approached the stronger are the
evidences of the desperate fight that
Buckley and the poolsellers are putting
up to carry their point. Half a dozen
merchants here were interviewed this
afternoon concerning the Colma incorpor
ation scheme. Not one of them would
express a decided opinion. Not one would
say that he approved the turning of
Coima into a resort for outcasts and for
plundering the young and the unsophis
ticated; still not one of the number men
tioned would commit himself in any way.
Has intimidation at this end of the county
been used as a weapon, while secrecy was
relied upon to keep the other end of the
county conveniently quiet until the
gamblers could hold up the Supervisors
and get all they want?
But there are outspoken men here who
dare to say what they think, many of
them. There is this significant difference
in the attitude of the people far from and
near Colma. The voters of the southern
end of the county make .some of their
responses on the hypothetical basis. Here
every one knows what is intended, and
have no question that the "falling down"
of the Board of Supervisors, if they act
against public good when the time comes
for action, will inflict great and lasting
injury. The history of incorporated towns
shows that disincorporation is almost un
known. If the gamblers once get Colma
incorporated they will never release it
from their deadly grip. Therefore the
proposed injury will be permanent, and
the Supervisors must make up their
minds to that understanding fully.
Rev. Father Callahan of the Catholic
church was interviewed briefly. He left
no room to doubt where he stands. He
said that gambling is such an evil and
is so injurious to the morals of a com
munity that all good citizens must oppose
Rev. Mr. Cowie. pastor of the Episcopal
church, said that the control of Colma
by gamblers would open up new opportu
nities for the depraved and vicious. Any
measure should be adopted that will pre
vent that. He saw the possibility of col
onizing Colma with outsider', so that the
real will of the property owners and citi
zens of the locality could easily be set
aÂ«idÂ»> If a public meeting should be
called he would be willing to address it
if his other engagements will permit, and
would sign a petition addressed to the
Supervisors if it was necessary to petition
the board. The people of his church would,
he was sure, sign any necessary protest
or petition. -.i .. Â
Judge R. L. Mattingly said: "Morally
speaking. I have no doubt that the in
crease of gambling is against the best in
terests of the people. If Colma is incor
porated solely to promote gambling it win
be a bad thing. So far as my say goes I
will oppose it." !_â â  , , ,
Rev. George Wallace, an Episcopal cler
gyman, spoke in the same general way as
Rev Mr. Cowie. He is willing to sign a
petition to the Supervisors.
The real fact now is that the gamblers
do not want the people to protest to the
Supervisors. They dread the moral force
of a protest signed by the voters of all
the districts represented by the Supervis
or* For that reason they are circulating
a story that they have nothing to do with
the Colma incorporation job. That story
is too thin for any one to credit who
knows any of the facts, but it may impose
on a few.
SUPERVISORS OPPOSE IT.
McCormick and Debeneciette
Will Not Helpthe Gamblers.
HALFMOON" BAT, Sept. 3.â The Call
representative interviewed the two coast
side Supervisors, Joseph Debenedette and
John McCormick. relative to the proposed
Monte Carlo gambling proposition at
Colma. and they both record themselves
as against calling a special election.
Supervisor John McCormick says: "I do
not favor gambling in any form whatso
ever, and shall use every effort to shut
out the proposed measure."
Joseph Debenedette in a signed state
ment says: -I have always opposed
gambling schemes as a matter of princi
ple and shall not deviate in this case
from my obvious duty. If the matter
comes before the Board of Supervisors of
San Mateo County I will oppose issuing a
call for a special election. The statement
that Bob Thornton and one Harrison
brought a sack to Redwood to corrupt
thf members of our board, and that a
conference was held with us relative to
a poolroom license, is a falsehood. I am
satisfied that in the light of recent events
our board will act as a unit in opposing
thi3 and al! other measures that tend to
foster gambling in San Mateo County.
Lopez Is in Sole Control.
R. E. de B. Lopez denies absolutely that
either Henry Schwartz or Chris Buckley
[g associated with him in the new c.urs
irg park n^ar C"lma. He also asserts
just as positively that his enterprise is a
rourslr.g park simply, and that It is not
connected in any way with the pool-sell
ers Mr Lopea exhibits a lease snowing
that he has control of the coursing park.
CRUEL MOTHER
ABANDONS HER
INFANT CHILD
Left in a Basement to
Starve.
A well-dressed young woman with r
hair and carrying in her hand a :
valise visited the basement of a house
at 5u7 Natoma street last evening. She
remained there only a few minutes and
disappeared as quietly as she came. A
Bhort time afterward a Mrs. Barry.
who lives in the house, was suddenly
startled by the cries of an infant, which.

theadjoining building. She hurried to
the place and was surprised to find a
two m- nths 1 old baby vainly struggling
to release itself from a shawl that cov
ered its tiny bod^'. .
Mrs Barry took the waif into her
house' and. after temporarily caring
the policeman on the
beat ' -U his suggestion the infant was
sent" to an institution at 406 Sutler :
St As et Â«oon as the matter was reported
to* the "police Captain Spillane detailed
two of his men to find the heartless
mother of the abandoned child. Th-Â»
interviewed a woman who lives on the
opposite side of the street, and from
her obtained a good description of the
woman. She described her as being
about Â°0 years of age, well dressed.
wearing a sealskin sacriue and having
diamonds in her ears. According to her
star? the woman, after reaching the
bouse where she discarded her off
Â«p-mg stopped suddenly and gazed up
and down the street, apparently to see
whether or not she was being followed.
After satisfying herself, presumably,
that she was safe from arrest and pos
sible exposure, she entered the haw
meat at the house. She emerged in a
few minutes with an open grip in hÂ»r
hand, and again glancing up and down
thÂ« street quickly disappeared.
Th" discarded child was well nourish

and was comfortably tucked in a shawl â 
of costly material. The police intend to

mother. _______

taking- the chair stated that an organiza
tion as proposed is essential to the In
terests of the men in the United States j
navy, as there have been heard at vari- |
ous t'inres a number of complaints from
naval veterans, who by themselves as in
dividuals were unable to have certain

The following was unanimously adopted :
"Whereas. In IBM the Naval Veteran

a membership of 358 members and became
affiliated with the National Association
of Naval Veterans, and now holding a
charter from that association: and
"Whereas. Since the formation of the

"Resolved, That this organization extend
a cordial invitation to all naval veterans
who served in the Civil War and the i
Spanish-American war, including marines,
and still serving in the American navy, to j

"Resolved, That the roster of this as

The chairman stated that the objects of
the association are to protect the interest
of naval veterans who are entitled to

MINNESOTA AND
SOUTH DAKOTA
HOME TOGETHER
Two Famous Regi
ments Now in Camp.
If it is true that all the world loves a
lover, the place for the world to congre
gate and enjoy Itself yesterday was the
wharf where the big transport Sheriuan
docked and discharged its heroic cargo
of veterans, whom It has brought home
across thousands of miles of ocean from
the far-away land of fever and deau.,
where they have been for the last year
and a half, winning honor for their flag
and covering the two States that sent
them forth with the luster of their
achievements.
When the transport drew Into the dock
the old dusty wharf looked like a fairy
flower garden filled with radiant Ameri
can beauties, so crowded was it with the
fair ones from Minnesota and South Da
kota who had traveled westward to greet
their heroes' return.
As soon as the vessel came within speak
ing distance femininity broke loose and
messages of love and welcome Hew thick
and fast, conveying in their passage the
hearts of the senders to the bronzed and
bearded men who hung over tlie ship's
sides as though they were afraid to lose
one weird of the tender welcome with
which they were fairly showered. It took
but a short time to make the transport
fast to her birth, and then the troops
were landed and formed along East street,
where they patiently awaited the arrival
of the escort that was to show them the
way to the home that had been prepared
for them In the Presidio.
The troops who were to act as escort
began to arrive shortly after the boys bad
ail gut ashore, and at 9 o'clock the pro
cession was ready to ttart on Its way up
Market street, where the public had been
waiting their arrival since early morn
ing. The advance consisted of Batteries
D, A, N and Light Battery O of the
Third United States Artillery. Then came
Troop C of the regular cavalry, which
was followed by the men from South
Dakota, under the command of Colonel
Frost. Behind the last rank of veterans
folluwed a number of carriages contain
ing Congressmen Gamble and Burke, a
number of invalided officers, with their
mothers, wives and sweethearts, and a
number of other carriages filled with rola
tlves, friends arid more mothers, wives
and sweethearts, whose heroes were not
invalided.
The carriages of the Minnesota contln
g< nt followed, a-nd then the Minnesota
regiment Itself, under the command of
i>leutenant-Coionel Frederick, who rodo
in advance with his two Majors, iilau
and Bt-an, on either side of him. The
parade was closed by three eoinnanies of
the .North L>akuta Regiment, headed by
their band. The band tiiat led liic pro
cession was the one belonging to tho
Third Artillery.
All along the line of march the troops
were wildly cheered, and when the soiled,
stained and shot-riddled battle Hags went
past there was great enthusiasm. Women
pelted the troop.s with kisses and flowers
while they alternately laughed and cried
In a .sort uf a happy hysteria. They were
not the only ones who had tears in their
eyes, however. More than one of the
stronger and supposedly sterner sex v. is
seen to surreptitiously put a handker
chief to his eyes under the cover of wip
ing the moisture of excitement from his
fi iren'ead.
The line of march was along East street
to Market, up ihal thoroughfare to Van
Ness avenue and thence to the Presidio.
At the corner of Van Ness avenue and
BuÃh street the men from the wars v.. i<>
reviewed by Major Noble, acting fur Ma
jor General Shatter. Upon arriving at
the Presidio the men at once went into
camp, and alter being allowed a few
minutes' rest were pounced upon by their
fellow soldiers and carried off to be
breakfasted. The South Dakotas were
taken rare of and treated to their initial
meal by the North Dakota and Wyoming
regiments, and the Minnesota boys were
Looked after by the lads of our own city.
As soon as their stomachs were ap
peased the men started to work about
camp getting their tents in such order an
they could while welcoming the hosts of
rs who crowded their quarters and
overwhelmed them with Questions and
congratulations.
Though everything scorned pleasant and
happy, there Is in both organizations a
deal of internal trouble and 111 feeling, all
of which has been publi.-hed in the col
umns of this paper. Colonel Frost is at
outs with Lieutenant Colonel Stover and
a number of other officers, and his dis
pleasure has resulted in the placing under
arrest of his next in rank and also Major
Warne, surgeon of ihe regiment, and First
Lieutenant 11. C. Bates. This trouble in
the South Dakota regiment originated In
letters addressed by some of the enlisted
men to Senator Pettigrew, In which they
Bpoke of their colonel in a very uncom
plimentary manner and characterized Ma
jor Howard as a tyrant and an arrant
coward. The officers under arrest are
charged by their commanding ollieer with
having instigated these epistles, or at
least having lent the writers of them their
moral support.
A visit was paid to the prisoners yester
day, but all attempts to induce them to
talk of their trouble proved unavailing.
They claimed that any discussion of tho
affair for publication would be unmilitary
and in very bad taste, and consequently
refused to submit to any interview on this
particular subject. It was easy to see,
however, that they have no love for their
commander, and the only sentiment they
feel toward Howard is one of contempt.
A little trip through the company streets
easily revealed the fact that the men to
a unit are with the arrested officers, and
particularly Is this a fact In the case of
Lieutenant Colonel Stover, whom they
greatly admire.
Tho situation In the Minnesota camp Is
worse, If possible. Colonel Ames went out
to the Presidio yesterday morning and
assumed command of the regiment as
soon as it arrived. That is about all he
did assume as far as his officers were
concerned. They left him severely alone,
and he wandered around the little city of
tents, speaking only to civilians and to
the few officers who were compelled to
address him In the course of the perform
ance of their official duties. Both he and
his officers refused to discuss the trouble
In any way whatever. Not so with the
men and those of the other regiment.
Thrv do not seem to take the same view
of the case as do the officers of the regi
ment. They say that it Is a put-up job
to down Ames, and that there is many a
man who is now throwing mud at him
who had feet cold enough to freeze water
on August 13 when the regiment was or
dered to support the Astor Battery and
whdi the officers almost to a man laid
down.
Wherever the blame may lie, all the
men and officers at the Presidio unite in
condemning the reception accorded Colo
nel Ames when he came aboard the trans
port. They say that whatever the feeling
that may exist between him and his offi
cers. It was both cowardly and unman
nerly for them to exhibit it before his
wife. They should have had enough chiv
alry, say these military critics, to have
Fpa'rod a woman the pain that such a re
ception must have caused the- wife of their
colonel.
The South Dakotas are proud of thoir
record, and particularly of the number
that have been chosen from among them
to wear the shoulder straps in Uncle
Sam's new regiments. Those who have
received the honor and conferred distinc
tion on the regiment are Lieutenant J. Q.
A Braden, who was given a like rank In
the Thirty-sixth Infantry: Captain Hage
man, who was made captain in the same
regiment; Sergeant Mann, given a sec
ond lieutenantcy under Captain Hapeman;
Lieutenant L. C. Foster, made captain in
the Thirty-seventh; Sergeant Russell,
made first lieutenant in the Thirty-sev
enth; Lieutenant Young, who was given
a captaincy In the Eleventh Cavalry, and
Lieutenant S. J. Larsen. who was given
the same rank In the same regiment.
Th<- Sheridan brought home seventy-six
invalided men, who were yesterday taken
to the Presidio hospital. There are four
Flight cases of typhoid among them, but
none are so serious but what with proper
mrdiclne and a little careful nursing they
will bo brought around all right.
Even we can't talk all the time. Come

BRAVE SOLDIERS AT
THE BANQUET BOARD
MRS. A. S. TOWNSEND ENTER
TAINS A FEW - EROES.
Flags and Silver and Crystal Flow
ers and Glittering Lights Make
the Table Beautiful.
Mrs. A. S. Townsend, the soldiers' true
friend, gave an elaborate dinner last even
ing al her home on California street. It
was a patriotic dinner, and the glorious
stars and stripes which many of the lady's
guests followed to victory were used with
exquisite effect to beautify the elegant
home and lend effect to the banquet board.
Exquisite crystal and gorgeous silver
glistened on the table, and in the midst of
it all were long-stemmed crimson carna
tions and delicate ferns arranged in deli
cate Venetian and old silver vases. The
mime cards were tiny tents topped with
miniature flags, 2nd tho boutonnicres
placed at the plate of each truest con
sisted of a single crimson carnation and
Bprig 01 maidenhair tied with a narrow
tri-colored ribbon. The 'conservatory open
ing off the dining room looked like a bit
of enchanted ground, with its little fairy
lights twinkling in the midst of the many
palms and rare exotics.
Mrs Townsend received her guests, as
sisted by Mrs. Bessie T. Smith and Miss
N. J. Rattigan. The charming hostess
wore an elegant gown of white brocade.
The jupe was perfectly plain cut, with a
demi-train. and the decollete corsage was
finished off with exquisite duchesse lace.
A magnificent collar of pearls and a dia
mond orcsa were the only ornaments
worn.
Seated at the table were: Colonel C. 11.

SANTA CRUZ EXTENDED A CALIFORNIA
WELCOME TO THE STATES NATIVE SONS
A PAGEANT AT THE SEASIDE CITY
THAT WILL GO DOWN INTO HISTORY
OPEN-HEARTED HOSPITALITY
MARKED THE OCCASION
Entertaining Was Done on a Most Elab
orate Scale by Local Parlors of
Sons and Daughters.
S.A N'TA CRUZ, Sept. 9.â Santa Cruz,
; part of it which went to bed
1 last night, has not yet been
able to flerure out Just what It
wakened up to this morning.
With 10.000 Native Sons and a score of
brass bands in town to participate in
the State's big,- birthday party, the
weikin and about everything else with
in reach has been ringing since the
first section of the San Francisco
special got in last night and dumped
2000 enthusiastic metropolitan Natives
loose under the flags, the lights and red
fire on Pacific avenue.
The arrival of the San Jose special
and the second San Francisco section
half an hour later lessened the gen
eral exuberance not one bit. The town
has been agog and aroar ever since,
and if present indications carry it will
be until after the Venetian Carnival,
which will close the celebration on
Monday night.
Santa Cruz has begun by keeping to
the letter the promises it held out to
the Natives of the biggest time they
have had in years, and as State Sena
tor and Past Grand. President Tom
Flint Jr. of San Juan' said to-day in a
little oration to a limited audience:
'Santa Cruz has. uncorked everything
from enthusiasm to condensed milk,
und the boys have succeeded in finding
everything but the milk."
The city has certainly taken no
chance of any blot on its reputation
for great big-hearted hospitality and
the ability to extend it. It is the opinion
uf the veterans of the order, and to It
they are giving free expression, that al
though the crowd is a few shy of the
usual number, never were they better
entertained. In winning out the cele
bration this year Santa Cruz was
doubly honored. Two of the citizens
of the city were elected grand officers
of the order at the last grand parlor-
Frank Mattison, Assessor of the coun
ty, grand president, and Milton Besse,
Sheriff, rand marshal. To both of
these popular Natives is the success of
this ear's celebration of Admission
day largely due.
To-day, although the local parlor of
Native Daughters has been dispensing
lavish hospitality at N. S. G. W. Hall,
the greater part of the celebration has
been on the street, and the two centers
of it all have been the St. George Hotel
and Pacific Ocean House, where nearly
all of ' San Francisco's parlors are
quartered. Bands and parlors and
fractions of parlors have paraded the
streets ever since the opening proces
sion of this morning came to an end.
Every headquarters in town has been
visited. revisited, and at the same time
relieved of its contents. It has been a
rackety time, and to-night, when every
parlor in town is keeping open house
rind the grand ball is on, there is no
abatement of the general festivity.
There are e.nough of them here who
are active in the body politic to go into
a nominating convention for either
party, and Stanford Parlor of San
Francisco would probably have the
casting vote. County Clerk "Billy"
Deane, its president, got in last night,
ns did School Director Ed Head, who
wants to be Sheriff, and Under Sheriff
Dave Martin. Assessor Washington
Dodge arrived on this morning's train,
and with him came Henry Martin.
Bruce Cornwall and Maxwell McNutt
have quit practicing law for the time
being and Joined the rest of the Stan
ford clique at the St. George. Mayor
Phelan arrived this morning in time
for the parade, and has been the guest
of Mayor Lamb of this city through the
day Judge Mogan and Judge Conlan
and Tom Hawkins, who will try to be
Judge at the next election, are also
among the "nollies" who are on deck,
as is Will H. Dick.
Past Grand President Frank L
Coombs and Past Grand Thomas Flint
Jr. are the especial charge of Grand
President Frank Mattison. All the
grand offers of the order are now in
town and they announce that the
crowd here will be augmented to-mor
row and Monday by those for whom
the Venetian Carnival of Monday night
I* the main attraction. Alameda Coun
ty is vociferously represented by Coun
ty Clerk Frank Jordan, Assessor Henry

IN GORGEOUS ARRAY.
The Great Procession Was
a Glittering Success.
BANTA CRUZ, Sept 9.â Santa Oniz
haa accomplished the biggest hearted
and most gorgeous reception 1n all her
history, and there axe 10,000 Native
and Daughters and their friends
who are here and testifying to that
with all tho windlneM of their well
i mined lunps. This morning's biff pro
cession, which formally opened the ac
( elebration of Admission day, was
leceM from whichever lamppost one
looked at it. There was neither hitch
nor halt In It from the time the last
Bection of the San Francisco special
pulled Into the depot with the last in
dent of Native Sons. Grand Mar
shal Milton Besse and his chief aid,
i â¢. Martin of San Francisco, had
their forces in line by 10 o'clock. Half
an hour later they escorted the San
Jose parlors from the Union depot to
the head of Pacific avenue, and at 11
o'clock welcomed the San Franciscans,
and the celebration was on.
The procession formed at the corner
N^Gu**? N 2r Jfr
of Mission and Vine streets, and from
there marched down Pacific avenue to
the foot of Mission Beach Hill, where it
countermarched to the head of the
avenue and there disbanded. It w*as as
! hard a matter to push a way along
Santa Cruz's long main street as it
was to break through the crowd that
two weeks ago came out on Market
street to shout itself into hysterics over
\ California's returned volunteers.
There was a squad of those same
volunteers in the parade to-day, and
it goes without saying that Santa Cruz
I uncorked the same brand of enthu
siasm that was turned loose in the
metropolis.
Pacific avenue was a flutter with
: banners and bear flags and hand
painted assurances to the Natives that.
; tht; town was theirs ana a welcome
wherever they wanted to look for it.
Grand Marshal Besse and Chief Aid
Martin led the line. Their aids, who
- followed them, were W. C. Hoffmann,
< h>f of staff: Harry I. Mulcreavy, H.
H. Farley, Walter A. Grattan. H. A.
horn, Max Qlas, Finlay B. Cook,
J. H. Aram, T. H. Ware, C. H. Ollin
ger, W. H. L. Hynes, Jeff Mann and
Carl K. Lindsay.
Santa Cruz followed with the local
parlor's guests of honor, Major Boxton
and tii.- First California Volunteers.
Santa t'ruz, as a body, was the gayest
â  d thing in the parade â white duck
trousers, white silk shirts, white hats
and Bilken sashes of th<- Stat lor â
yellow. The division was marshaled by
George H. Wink!.- of the local parlor
and he was assisted by K. K. Shelby
and District Attorney Ben Knight.
Santa Cruz Native Sons failed to carry
off the honors, however, despite the
lavish silkiiK-ss of their attire. It was
the Daughters who goi the shouting.
The entire local parlor, No. 90, with the
Carnival Queen, Miss May Baldwin,
and her handsome maids of honor were
clustered on a huge float ihat was so
different from the regulation affair of
tawdry tinsel that it detracted not one
whit from the beauty of its occupants.
Right after them came the grand
officers of the order, Grand President
Frank Mattison and Past Grand
Thomas P'lint Jr. of San Juan, and all
the other past gTands who have been
created by successive elections. Henry
Martin, San Francisco's genial SherifC,

A FEW OF THE THINGS THAT HAPPENED.
ADDRESS OF THE DAY.
Grand Orator Byington Cre
ates a Profound Im
pression.
SANTA CRUZ, Sept. 9.â The principal
i feature of the literary exercises at the
'â¢ armory this afternoon was the splendid
speech of Lewis F. Byington, grand or
ator of the order of Native Sons. Bylng
ton's speech is accepted by the hundreds
| who heard it as the ollicial expression of
the political leanings of a majority of tho
! members of the association for whom ha
: spokeâ that is, in so far as he eschewed
i history and alluded to the political ques-
I tions of the day.
The First Regiment band opened the
I programme, and Grand President Matti
i son followed with a cordial speech of wel
come to every visiting Son and Daughter,
' He also made it the occasion to speak in
highest praise of Mr. Byington, whom he
i introduced as the orator of the day.
i Byington said in part:
Mr. Chairman and Fellow Citizens: It 1b
â¢ scarcely more than fifty years ago since across
i the peaceful waters of the bay by the side
t of which your homes are clustered the Stars
and Stripes were first raised In the "West to
flash a message of promise throughout the
world that thenceforward and forever thÂ« soil
of California was wedded to the Union and
to the principles of free government for which
that Union stands.
In those flity years how marked has been
the improvement, how wonderful the ad
vancement of this great West. The lone flag
which waved that day In Monterey was per
chance the sole one in all America glided by
the rays of the summer sun as it sank to rest
In the' bosom of the Pacific, and now on each
recurring national holiday a signal may bo
sent from banner to banner from the heat
parched plains of Mexico to the rustling pines
of Victoria and from the wave-kissed sands by
the I'aciiic to where the angry surf of the At
lantic hf-ats round Plymouth Rock; while in the
hundreds of cities and towns which have blos
pomed in the AYest. from every plain and val
ley, rich in their spreading verdure, from the
Bloping. vtne-ihid hills of the Coast Range
to where the majestic outlines of the Sierras
lift to heaven their snow-clad crests, this day
flutters in the breeze from school and hall and
home, from rock and lofty pine, the starry
emblem of our nationality.
As the starry folds of the banner raised by
Commodore Bloat were caught Dp by the breeze
I from the ocean, flashing the promise of a new
era throughout this golden land, California,
dressed In her robes of freedom, advanced to
challenge the admiration of the world. \\ Itli
what pride the patriotic citizen of this State
can look abroad over the fair domain and note
the wraith and beauty gathered there.
Within her broad confines nature with a
lavish hand has scattered the fruits and treas
ures of a thousand favored chines. From
where the lofty dome of Shasta lifts to heaven
Its never-fading cnest of winter to the far
southland perfumed with the fragrance of
myriad orange groves she blossoms an the rose.
Her sloping hills empurpled with the vine and
fruited orchard, her valleys bright with golden
grain her mountains golden seamed. Glorious,
California, Is the heritage bequeathed to thy
children. Glorious should thy future be.
And vet my friends, all the boundless wealth
that sleeps within her hlllÃ or brightens all
her plains would weigh as naught compared
to her heritage of liberty and the blessings
of free Institutions resting upon a broad foun
dation of noble manhood.
Deep planted in the heart of very patriot
is the sentiment of loyalty to something which
is over and above all the material wealth nnd
grandeur of nations; which weds him to the
woll not en account of the abundance of its
riches or the pleasant appearance of Its land
scapes out because upon that soil the Insti
tutions he loves have found root and over it
all is breathed the spirit of freedom sanctified
by the deeds of its martyrs. It is this senti
ment which carries us back to the trials and
tribulations of our pioneer fathers, which stirs
the heart at the recollection of the achieve
ments of the hardy Continentals, which sancti
fies the memory of those who gave to us the
Immortal declaration of a people" â¢ rights. It
la this sentiment which boots loftily among
tlie rugged peaks and crags of the mountains
us In the flower-bedecked valleys or the busy
marts of trade.
It Is to strengthen this attachment toward
the land of their birth, to venerate the prin
ciples which are there established and to cher
ish the memory of those who have done so
much to advance the cause of our free Institu
tions that the young men under whose auspices
this celebration Is held have associated them
selves together. Not that they claim any spe
cial privilege over the citizen born on another
soil, but that they seek to teach the members
of the fraternity their duty to the State, to im
plant in their hearts a love for Its institutions
and to make of them better men and better
citizens, for It Is upon the Integrity of her
ritizens that our State must df|if>nd to place
ht-r In the vanguard of civilization, to aid her
In carrying the principles of American liberty
and American honor to every nation of the
globe.
Mv friends, upon the 9th day of next Sep
tember the patriotic sons of California will
fittingly celebrate in the city of San Francisco
the fiftieth nnr.lvprsary of her admission Into
the Union; but while it was upon the 9th day
of September, 1850, that the act of admission
t finally received the aprrov.il of the President,
flftv years ago this very month there was gath
ered in Colton Hall, at Monterey, a convention
tl r lirfiad-mlniled and patriotic men upon whom
all eyes were turned and who, in the words of
their' chairman, were to srive proof to the world
I that California had not been settled entirely by
â¦ unintelligent and unlettered men. How well
jL they dfd their duty the world knows. It was
r really at this time that the new State was
â¦ born and upon the 13th day of October, 1849,
A the first constitution of California solemnly re-
I c-lved the approval of the delegates, and she
â¦ stood ready to be welcomed Into the sisterhood
1 of the Union. .
v All honor to the hardy pioneers who laid the
1 foundation of an American commonwealth.
T Wherever the spirit of adventure or the search
<** for fortune may have led them, they yet car-
ried their devotion to the sacred principles of
liberty ami proved their capacity for organ
izing the institutions of self-government. No
braver, nobler, higher types of manhood have
ever existeJ In the history of a nation than the
pioneers who carved out the destinies of the
great West They were the bold spirits who
Biased the way fur American civilization ami
planted the principles of free government and
the Reeds of education in the trackless forests,
and upon the hitherto unexplored shores of the
Pacific. With the march of progress followed
the seminary, the college, the university until
now there has blossomed on every plain and
valley and mountain a seat of learning, mmm
which the American youth may drink at the
fountain of learning and the common scnooi
system has become the defense and the pride
of the republic.
If the reputation of California, in times of
peace has become world-wide for the grandeur
of her mountains, the beauty of her valleys,
the wealth of her material resources and the
high standard of her educational institutions;
In times of war she has not been found want
ing in fidelity to the Union and to the prin
ciples of free government.
The very first company of troops to land upon
the soil of Cuba, in defense of an oppressed
people, was a company of United States regu
lars that marched away from tho Presidio at
San Francisco. And when the call for volun
teers came from the President, full In the

our own First California. It led the long list
of gallant regiments that went sailing out
through the Golden Gate to win In the far

forth In California's name to uphold the na
tion's flac.
From the very birth of our Government the
achievements of the American navy have be>-n
the wonder and admiration of the 1 world, but
never haH Its fame shone forth more brightly
than In the late war with Spain, and linked
forever with it will be the name of the Golden
State.
The peerless Olympla, flagship of the Pacific
squadron, which led the Invincible fleet into
Manila Bay. and from whose bridge the daunt
less Dewey directed his line of battle, in the
great naval engagement, which resulted in
such a signal victory to our arms, had he-r
keel first baptized in the waters of San Fran
cisco Hay. It is but a few years since tho poet
sang of that trackless and almost unknown
land "where rolls the Oregon and hears no
sound save its own flashings," and yet the
other day there -went forth from the California
forge and workshop and out through the
Golden Gate an Oregon that has carried the
name of the American navy in undying glory
all round the globe.
Our flag should ever stand as the emblem of
our nationality. Wherever its broad foHs
wave in the breeze it should carry a me?sace
of peace it should bear with it the integrity
of American principles. It should proclaim to
the world the lesson of our devotion to civil
nnd r^liffi^us liberty, our veneration for the
teachings of the father of the republic, our at
tachment to everything that advances human
knowledge or adds to the grent store of human
happiness. May all mankind learn from it
that the people's rights are best guarded by
the purity of the nation's laws nnd the in
tegrity of their administration. Girded round
by the love and faith and hope of a nation of
freemen it finds in them a safer bulwark
than does tyranny with all the bristling bayo
nets of its military strength. L#t us leave
to the monarchies of other lands the
that before their blood-stained banners the
weaker nations bow in fear and trembling
and liberty shrinks back affrighted, but may
the hope of even' American be that wherever
the flag of his country is borne, the freemen
of every land may proudly greet its coming,
the oppressed rise up to bless it, the slave
to kiss its folds.
TALKED OF OLD TIMES.
Pioneers Enjoy a Picnic and
Bay Excursion.
"Hello, old fellow: you don't seem to
grow a day older, and you look just as
young as you did when we met last
year."
That and similar expressions was the
style of the greeting between Pioneer and
Pioneer as they met yesterday at their
annual reunion and celebration of Admis-
sion day. A day of pleasure had been
planned, and the Pioneers and their in
vited guests enjoyed themselves to the
fullest extent. An excursion on the bay
and a picnic at El Campo comprised the
programme. There were no orations, no
poems and no set exercises. Every one
was at liberty to enjoy himself or herself
as fancy directed.
The steamer Ukiah was chartered for
the occasion. It left Tiburon ferry at 10
o'clock in the morning with a party num
bering- close on to 3000. It went down the
bay as far as the Union Iron Works, and
on the return trip toward the picnic
grounds cruised among the shipping and
went as close to the lowa and Marbleheail
as possible to give the excursionists a
good view of the floating fighting ma
chines.
.As soon as the steamer reached El
Campo the Pioneers and their friends set
about without delay to dispose of the con
tents of well-tilled lunch baskets before
they gave time to the other pleasures of
the day.
Judge Nlles Searles entertained the offi
cers of the Pioneers and a few intimate
friends at a banquet served en tu.
grounds. There were a few speeches of
congratulation, but most of the talk was
in the nature of reminiscences of the
days of forty-nine. Among the Judges'
guests were Rev. S. H. Y\ llley, chaplain
of the Pioneers: Chief of Police Lees.ex-
Chlef Justice McKinstry, John H. Jew
ett, John F. Pinkham, S. W. Holladay,
A A. Coffey and Judge Cotton, ex-pres
ldent of the Pioneers.
Following the luncheon Judge Searles
called the picnickers together at the
dancing pavilion. Rev. Mr. Willey in
voked the blessing of the divine spirit on
the Pioneers and the State, after which
the Judge briefly welcomed the guests.
He said:
I enjoy this proud duty of welcoming
you beneath these sylvan shades to join
with us in celebrating the anniversary
of the birth of our glorious State. Fellow
pioneers, your labors and mine are nearly
accomplished. Soon our sons and daugh
ters will take our places, and I have
every reason to believe and hope that
they will conduct the affairs of our so
ciety with as much wisdom and charac
ter as you, my ancient friends. Now, wo
are here to-day to enjoy ourselves, and
my admonition is to go at it as your in
clinations direct."
Dancing followed until late in the after
noon. Blum's orchestra furnished the
music. The committee in charge of the
affair consisted of William Z. Tiffany, B.
T. Kruse, Allen Knight, E. M. Root, E.
B. Vreeland, 11. Bouton and K. R. Rufs.
Roberts Vandercook officiated as floor
manager during the dancing.

Complexion*
33y 97? me. 3fc/geia,
Â«7 HAPPENED to pass through the
bathing suit department of one of the
I! downtown shops a few days since Just
at the time when a particularly tempt
ing lot of bathing suits were being dis
posed of at really bargain prices. I pledge
you my word the women were clustered
about that counter as thick as flies about
a molasses jug, and chattering like so
many magpies. Believing a riot to be
imminent I gathered up my skirts and
elbowed my way out of the crowd as has
tily as possible, but not before the
thought had occurred to me that a few
words for the special benefit of the maid
en who Is still butterflying away the days
at the seashore would not be amiss in this
column.
There Is no tonic in the world equal to
a salt sea bath. A dip into the briny
deep is not only delightfully refreshing.
but it is invigorating and strengthening
to the body as well, providing the sub
ject be robust. It is particularly benefi
cial to women who are inclined to obe
sity, tut the thin, nervous girl should in
dulge In moderation. An aching head,
fatigue and blue linger nails are the sig
nals that she has been in the water long
enough, and she should at once hast-en
out.
Statements to the contrary notwith
standing, .^ea bathing is destructive to the
complexion and will also play havoc with
silky tresses unless precautions are taken.
To leave salt water on the fare. neck,
arms and hands will certainly prove dis
astrous. Therefore a cold, fresh shower
should always follow the plunge. If this
is not available then have a bowl of fresh
water In your dressing-room and sponge
Oil with it before getting into your clothes.
If a pure cold cream Is rubbed into the
Bkin as soon as possible after this rins
ing tan or sunburn will be less likely to
make 'he skin unsightly.
Another thing. Before entering the wa
ter be careful to wet the hands, face, neck
and chest. If this precaution is neglected
the blood is liable to rush to the head
and disfigurements in the shape of red
blotches may be left on the face.
Sometimes an ugly little crop of erup
tions will appear after a bath in the surf.
When this happens it is a pretty sure in
dication that salt water does not agree
with that person, and the bath should
not be repeated.
Some women have an idea that when
taking a sea bath every day the fr. ?h
water ablutions can be dispensed with.
This is altogether wrong. Cleanliness
like virtue, is its own reward, and in the
bathtub, with a good, firm flesh brush,
plenty of fresh warm water and soap will
be found a rapid transit line to beauty.
When taking your swim in the ocean
do not let the salt water get into your
hair if you wish to keep it fluffy and nice.
You can easily prevent this by wearing
a rubber cap and exercising a little care.
If the hair does get mcflstened despite
precautions, then it must be shampooed
afterward and carefully dried, and no
mischief will be done.
A delightful cream to be used after
coming out of the surf, or, In fact, at any
time, is the following:
CUCUMBER CREAM.
Take two rather ripe cucumbers. Wash
carefully and slice very thin without re
moving the green outer skin. Place be
tween two plates, bo that the juice will
drain from them. Let stand over night
and strain through muslin. Melt twenty
grains of white wax In a porcelain ket
tle, and add to it two ounces of the very
best oil of sweet almonds. Remove from
tha fire and add half an ounce of roae-

HOPELESS SINNERâ I really cannot
answer your question in this department.
I am chary of giving advit?e in such mat

stamped, addressed envelope I will give
you ray opinion on the subject.
MARY SIN'BADâ If you will apply a lit
tle lemon juice to tlmsp brown spots on
your hands, let It dry on and then use a
little cold cream It will whiten them
nicely. The cold cream, formula for which.
Is given in to-<lay's Beauty Talk, will be
found to be a splendid bleach. The fol
lowing process Is said to bo a quick way
of wintering the hands. You might try
it: Rub them well at night for three
nights in succession with airnond o!l and.
then cc^er them with as much tine chalk
as they will take. I expect this would,
be moro effectual if a large pair of gloves
were Â»irn over nifjht.
OYPSY QUEEN I am Forry. but I
haven't a good formula for liquid pow
der. Massage the hollows in the ne<'lc
with equal parts of lanolin, cocoa butter
and COCOanut oil melu-d together. Or
ange flower skin food Is the best all
round skin food you could possibly find.
The use of the skin food and powder will
not enlarge the pores of the skin, par
ticularly if the face is well scrubbed with
a complexion brush, warm water and cas
tile soap every niÂ»ht before retiring.
VOI'TH-I wisli, you would try the cu-^
cumber cream, formula for which is given y
in to-day's Beauty Talk. T know you will
find it delightful. Do not attempt to re
move the TUJKf from your face. Those
things are beat left severely alone. Out
of-door exercise Is the best thing to put
into the cheeks. Or it may be that
you need an iron tonic to increase tha
number of red corpuscles in your bloo.l.
I would not advise you to do anything
more to the hair at the back of the neck
than to brush it up persistently.

landed within easy walking distance of

delicious steaks iked on an immense
gridiron in the open air, and of sweet
(-â urn.
After lunch there was the distribution
of a number of useful gate prizes, after
which Grand Assistant Dictator Ben

lowed by Grand Dictator Prescott L.

the work of the Knights of Honor, and
stated that in their twenty-six years of ex

having i'ast Grand Chief Ranger C. P.
Renden of Stockton elected to the posl
tion of sub-supreme chief ranger. Cali
fornia, through the American Forester
Review, the official organ, made a claim
I for recognition in the supreme body on the
â  ground that the jurisdiction of California
! had done, unusually good work for the or
-1 der at large, and the result shows that
the claim was recognized as a just one.
There was considerable legislation dur
i ing the session, but the most Important
waa the adoption of an amendment from
California to the effect that it must ap
pear by the certificate of a competent
physician that the wife of the member
Joining, if he In married, is in sound bod
ily health to enable the member to de
rive any benefits in case of her death.

Ati Ii ;â > The Call.
DEL MONTE. Sept. 9.-After an un
bridled arid unbroken course of clouting
Whitman and Wright, the tennis invinc
iblcs from Boston, foil with a sickening
fall yesterday afternoon under the swing
ing racket Hows of Sam and Sumner
Hardy; The many clouts, for such have
thejstinging?deÂ£eats at the hands of the
East been dubbed; are now wiped off the
slate, for this single victory; retains the
doubles championship for the West, and
was as sensational *Â»a contest as has ever,
been seen on the Pacific I oast. In three
straight, sets the Hardys rang the death
knell of the Easterners; who have been
hailing on oceans of victory erer since last
Tuesday; the inaugural of the Atlantic-
Paciflc tournament.
Game by panic the score advanced until
the boards read five all. The local team
took the aggressive. Sam Hardy was sud
denly metamorphosed into a clout< r.
Whenever the opportunity offered he
BmaÃhed the balls nke another Davis and
it was these strokes combined with skill
ful placing, superb cuts across court and
< areful h< ad work that won the set for
the Hardys. Five all. six all and then two
games in rapid succession gave â  he match
to the plucky Westerners. Whitman and
Wright were bewildered; it was some
thing novel to their tennis understandings
and they changed courts automatically
lor the beginning of the next set.
llobart wanted to bet .. liittier horses
on the result of the match, but both pick
ed the same team so neither will collect.
All books having lixe.l their slates the
second sot was called. Again the Hardys
won the tirst game, but lost the following
two only to even up the score on the fourth.
They then went ahead again; but again
the score was tied, three all and a palpi
tating grandstand waiting for the end.
Courage and daring eat In the hearts of
the Hardys and for the Irst time in their
lives they played with a reckless bril
liancy Driving and chopping everything
in sight by .Sumner and an outclouting
of the dinners by Sam, saw the end of
this set. which read 6â3 in favor of the
Oakland boys. Alter this there was no
more ruthless betting, except by the ,
youthful enthusiasts on the back benches
'who had cigarettes to burn and gum to
tril'.e with indigestion: In the third set
there was no question ay to the outcome.
Although every point was contested the
Hardys played hard and brilliant tennis '
right 'up to the end. The last point of the
{Tame was the most sensational rally of â 
ihe match and won by Sam Hardy's
tjnash after a. rail v that ..is the cause of â 
three distinct cases of nervous prostra
tion. Volley after volley, with the quickest |
lacket play at the end. all four men in
action; was what the spectators went wild |
over. For a time it looked as if the game
would never end. but Sam Hardy's ter
minal smash did the trick.
â¢'Unmo, match, set; tournamentâ
win!" yelled Joe Daily in the scorer's box;
but bi-lore he had finished the victors
leaped over the net and were shaking
hands with the vanquished. There was
rot much joy in the Eastern countenances
Lut the Western beams more than coun
terbalanced. â 
Then the crowd surged in on the Hardys
md to-morrow they will have swelled
handsâ not heads.
The ladies' championship singles was
played out to-day between Miss Button of I
Los Angeles and' Miss Bee Hooper of Say
Francisco. This was the sole match 01
the tournament, and now Mi.-s Sutton is
the proud possessor of a very handsome
toilet set, the prize offered by -Mr. Douty.
The first set of the match went to Miss i
Hooper, with the .score 6â i. Miss Sutton
was slightly nervous and not able to reach ;
her regular game. In the second set she
improved, while Miss Hooper showed
weakness her returns losing their char
acteristic 'strength and sureness. The set
was won by Miss Sutton, 6â.'!. The third
set went to' the young lady, but not until I
every game was fought out to a bitter
iinish. The score was oâi,0 â i, and now Miss
Hutton is the champion lady player of the
Pacific Coast, Miss Jones being absent and
neglecting to defend her title.
The consolation doubles played to-day
resulted as follows:
Collier and Stauf won from Jones and
Arguello by default; McFarlan and Stew
art from Braly and Bell by default; John
sun and Argufllo lost to Farlan and
Stewart, oâ4, Â«â 2; Hunt and Seager beat
Fatjo and Warburton. 3â6, 6 â 3, 9â7;
Bliven and Code beat Collier and Stauf,
(â¢ â 4 i_6, ti â Finals: Hunt and Seager,
oâ3, 6âl. 6â2.
The week of tennis culminated to-night
in a banquet tendered the Eastern men by
the Pacific Coast Association. Besides
tho four Eastern players, the Whitneys,
the Hardys and George Wright were
present.

Clark, settled once tor all who is. entitled
termed the champion of his el
for the little bay gelding downed a high
class field in straight heats and In doing
so set a new track race record of 2:11).
Azot< in 1894 stepped a faster mile, but not
in an actual contest
In the Vinctor stake the esohschnltzia
if Mat Stora were carried to the front I
by Jennie K'-i<i, ridden by young Loulller,
with Hohenzollern, Libertine and Nllgar
finishing m the cloud of dust left behind
by the winner, oi five favorites furnished
oil thr iriL-nu. but two earned brackets.
William Kleldwick had the track in rare
,v i condition, and those who looked for
last time were not disappointed. The
2:20 pace was lirst called, with Wild Nut
ling selling favorite over the field. For
the opening heat (laff Topsail drew the
pole position, but It availed the chestnut
horse nothing. Valeria soon headed the
bunch, with the favorite in close attend
ance. Straightened for home, Donathan
called on \\ il<l Nutllng and at the wire
won easily, with Myrtha Whips second
and Gaff Topsail third.
In the heat following Dick Havey
sprung a surprise with KoMet, going to
the front and beating Nutling out very
handily at the wire. The same man- re
peated the trick in the third heat, Wild
Nntlinp stopping to a walk. Then came
another change. The Myrtha Whips party
backed the odds against the mare from 5
!,, 2 to l to -. and she took the next thred
heats in impressive fashion. In the fourth
heat Wild Nutllng pulled up badly dis
tressed and was drawn. Best time made,
2:12.
When tho free-for-all was called friends
of the past did not forsake the old cam
paigner Klamath, for in the. auction
pools he brought 8 against 10 for Toggles
and 3 for the field, consisting of Clay S,
Hazel Kinney, Boodle. Prince Gift and
Neernut. Boodle, driven by Bunch, had
the pole position in the opening heat, and
to a perfect start showed first until near
ing the bend for home, where Toggles
strode Into first position, winning frc*i
the deposed leader without being pressed
Klamath made a couple of "jimmies"
during the' trip, but managed to finish
third. The next heat was a repetition
almost of the first, only that Toggles led
from the word, passing the judges five
lengths uhead of Klamath. Neernut, of
which great things were expected, was
third in this heat.
Of the four starters for the Vinctor
stake, over a mile, the Sacramento con
tingent sent Nilgai* with Jack Ward up
to the post a slight choice over Jennie
Reid Libertine and Hohenzollern were
both 2 to 1 chances in the betting. Havey
made a perfect start and Libertine and
Hohenzollern at once made for the had,
.lighting it out for nearly six furlongs.
Well into the stretch I>>ullier made his
move with Jennie Reid, disposing of
Hohenzollern at the wire somewhat easily
by a length In 1:41%. The favorite ran
last.
A six-furlong dash for two-year-olds,
which followed, was responsible for the
downfall of Bamboulia, The big colt was
sen! to the post a pronounced choice, hut
Thorpe, who had the mount, was pock
eted the first part and at the end did not
figure among the first three. With the
race well in hand Morse, astride Con-
Btellator, fell asleep during the final
Stages of the game and was beaten out
a neck by Sunello, the Storn entry, which
came fast from the rear. Show honors
went to The Buffoon
Cromwell, a 4 to 5 favorite, with Mack
lin in the saddle, managed to beat the
harrier in the closing seven-furlong event
and was never headed. Isew Moon closed
up a vast amount of lost ground, taking
the place in a drive from Manzanilla.

these finished.
The race lost a strong 1 element of inter
est from the fact that J. W. Pew -
ant, the most dangerous rival
Aeolus, was put out of the contest
minutes after crossing the startin-
The Aeolus came up to the line sh<:
before the signal to start was giw
slacked sheets and hovered along It, I
ally crossing It on the port tack
fifteen seconds after the whistle. X
seconds later the Presto and the Amij:
went across, and five minutes after the
whistle Gorter's Sans Soucl crossed. Th:
Truant and Mignon were the last to pass
over the line, about ten minutes late.
The Emma, on the port tack, bore duw:i
upon the Truant on the starboard tack,
and getting her bowsprit entangled in the
Truant's topping-lift, slewed her round s>
that the Truant ran head on toward the

wharf obliquely, and her peak having

was picked up by Frank Stone's Presto.
Just after she had crossed the finishing

fouled the wharf. She was soon cleared,
having sustained no damage. A few min

passed. The starboard bow struck the

THEIR EMPEROR
Agrarians Active in
Germany.
BERLIN. Sept. 9.â The situation in
Internal politics has been somewhat in- !
tensified this week. The dismissal of '
several Cabinet members and a number I
of higher Prussian officials is merely a
symptom of this. The Emperor, as
King of Prussia, before starting for the
man- - had lengthy conversations !
â¢with Prince yon Hohenlohe, the Imper
ial Chancellor and President of the
Prussian Council of Ministers, and Dr. I
Mlquel, Vice President of the Council
and Minister of Finance, In which the
difficulties of the situation were thor- i
oughly discussed. The Emperor hopes '
to see the canal bill pass when it is re- j
Introduced, with modifications, at the '
next session, notwithstanding the op- I
position of the Agrarians. In this he '
will probably be disappointed, Respite I
the methods empldyed In disciplining i
the Agrarians aid the Government of- {
facials serving as delegates to the Diet, i
The Emperor is resolved to go to the 'â 
length of forcing the resignation of ;
every official, be he high or low. who ;
actively sympathizes with the powerful
Agrarian Society, the Bund der Land- I
â wirthe. This, will strike many.
At a secret meeting of the Agrarian
leaders this week it was resolved to try
to checkmate the Emperor by playing
off the canal bill against the anti-strike
measure and thus render impossible
the immediate dissolution of the Diet,
lor it is argued that the Emperor can
not rely on the Agrarians and Con- !
servatives to father his pet and the
strike bill and at the same time dis
solve the Diet because the same memb
ers do not sanction another of his pet
measures.
The Agrarian leaders will do their
Utmost to impress this upon the Em- ',
peror'a mind. They also count on the \
probability of the dissolution of the 1
Reichstag on the rejection of the anti- !
strike bill, of which there is hardly a |
doubt, as the Center and the Left are j
resolved to bury the measure igno- (
mir.iously. Besides, the Agrarians be- j
lieve that they have a chance of de- j
feating the renewal of the commercial
treaties, especially the one with Rus- |
E'a. or of considerably modifying them, j
co as to render them unacceptable to i
the other governments. They will in- j
cist upon a higher tariff on Russian
cereals, which Russia will not stand.
They also strongly hope that the com- i
merciai treaty with the United States
will not be ready for presentation to
the. Reichstag at its next session and
that the failure of the other treaties
will involve that with the United j
States.
In the meantime it is reported that
the Emperor is furious with the i
Agrarians, -and the Associated Press;
representative here learns that his
Majesty has pronounced in favor of a !
rc-inliche scheindung (clear secaration) '
between the Agrarians and the Govern
â  ment. saying that such a party had no
reason to be in .--..-. where every â 
government for generations has been ;
solicitous for the country's agricultural
interests; and that this class of Doli- â  :
tics has gone about far enough, He is : ;
particularly wroth at the way in which ;
the ' Agrarian press has handled him : '
and the Cabinet. The leading Agrarian .
journals ad many conservative organs â  .
have been very outspoken. The ' !
Deutsche Agrar correspondent even ad- ; .
vised putting the members of the Cab- ; <
met submitting to the wishes of the j I
Emperor under parliamentary, public : !
and social ban until his Majesty should ; |
be unable to find mere creatures to do ; .
his will and should then be oblisred to , '
take men for ministers. The official or- ! :
pan of the Conservatives condemns the . '
disciplining of orficials. | j
The Deutsche Zeitung. under the cap- j '
tion "Continued in Our s-\-.' says: | .
"The executions under the present j
Cabinet. have come in sections, like a
s-r;al novel."
The Liberal papers comment various- |
: ly. Herr Eugene Richter. the Radical â ' â¢
leader, condemns the Government and ! .
announces that his party the Freis- 'â  '.
Einige Volkspartei. will introduce some j '
Eensatlonal bills In the Reichstae and ; â¢
the Diet. ) .
An amusing feature nf the press cam- ; '
palgn asair.st the Emperor and the ; \
Government is that the Conservative?, I ;
â who. v.-hile enjoying the favor of the ; â 
Government, were opposed to the con- : '<
stitutlon and parliamentarism, hare ' *
become great friends of them. One ft:

The attitude of the rural population
shows no approval of the Government's
disciplinary measures. One dismissed
official. Herr yon Brockhausen. was
honored by a torchlight procession in
the Dramburg district, in which the
whole local population participated. A
number of officials intend to show their
â  :Uhy with the Agrarians by re-
Bigning. These include President yon
Puttkamer of Pomerania and President
yon Tischowa of Koenigsburg. The
situation as a whole is that of a drawn

"ians. the latter meaning to dem

A BIG PRESIDIO BLAZE.
Twenty Thousand Dollar Con
flagration That Destroyed
the Old Corral.
A large fire broke out at the Presidio
at 5:"Â» yesterday morning, completely de
stroying- the two-story frame building- ad
joining the officers' club, which has been
generally known as the "bachelors' cor
ral." The fire, which it Is supposed origi
nated !n the kitchen, was first discovered
by the sentry on guard, who promptly
sounded the alarm. Lieutenant Evans,
Fire Marshal of the post, was promptly
or. hand, lines of hose were laid and soon
sever streams of water were playing
or. the conflagration. Soon after a couple
cf engines arrived from the near-by city
stations and added their efforts to aid the
soldiers. But ail these efforts, owing to
the poverty of the water supply, proved
unavailing, and a little before noon ..A
that remained of the corral" was a heap
of smoldering ruir.s. over which two tall
chimneys stood guard. During the after- ,
noon one of the chimneys tell.
This is the thirteenth time the building
had been or. fire and the third time within
the present year. The ioss is estimated at
about 520.0Â». including the $5000 which
was expended in repairs after ..he last
blaze.
Those who â were living in the house at
the time of last night's fire mar.aced to
save most of their property, though it
was considerably damaged by smoke and
water. The*' were Mrs. Nelson, wife of
Lieutenant Neiscn; Mrs. Swift, wife of
Chaplain Swift: the family of Dr. Ped'ar.

PLAYER FOLK,
THROUGH THE
CRITIC'S EYE
IN this latitude neither sun nor rain
is vertical in its attacks, and ihe
critical pen seems much affected by
the climate. It starts out ink-full
of the most downright crushing inten
tions, and swerves to windward about
half way to the paper, blown thither by
the wind of justice, or what masquerades
for justice. With the thought In mind
rhat "no one is respectable who is not
just,'' the mask is too often greeted un
writtingly as the face and this should not
be. Especially is this true when high
priced productions are in review. A dol
!ar and a half presupposes a good play.
a first-class company, correct and artis
tic scenery, and :he exhaustive rehearsai
of adequate stage management. When
the foremost theater fails to keep this
faith with the public, empty benches are
and should be the result. Mr. Clement's
is at best a two-man companyâ himself
and Augustus Cook. Add to this draw
back one poor play and one familiar and
you have the cause of small houses. With
the popu!ar-priced theater offering co
much that is good, patronage wilt follow
only in the wake of full vaiue received.
To surround oneself with a mediocre com
pany is the most unwise thing a young
man can do, for fame will not outlast
success. And now there Is the monotony
of two closed theaters, at a time when
the world is back from the seashore and
eady to be amuse-i. But something too
nuch of this . -â â¢â¢â- .-. look into
the future is the remedy. Madame Mod

There is neither shade nor shelter from
amusement at the Gr;>heum this week,

plause, the little dancers. Charley Case

just what tiny current of agitation nils

â¢ â¢ â¢
The oftener I listen to opera, comic and
srrand. the more thoroughly am I con
vinced' that most of the sober singers (by
this I m<--an those who are not comedians)
have â¢â .-.. costume to distinguish
them from the concert artist. Especially
i~ this so in solo work, for each in turn
walks straigh' to the front of the stage
v.-hf-never possible and sings confidentially
to the audience as though they were part
of the company. Could anything be
more thoroughly inartistic and ridic
ulous? ' Gesture seems a matter of time
and beat and phrase, and if there is any
intellectual significance to It, what that
significance is is caviare to the general
publci. Grand opera makes such demands
upon the voice that, save with the very
greatest, dramatic impulse must be kept
in check for the sake of smooth delivery.
Th^re are four artists on the Tlvoii stage
who rise well to the dignity of gTand
operaâ Salas?a, Berthald, Avedano and
Prossnitz. Of these Salassa is the only
one who acts, and he often does so most
unwiliir.glv. The bravas of enthusiasm
are all tor the well-sung numbers, for
the import of the score is. under the cir
cumstances, about last in tte thought of
an audience.

THE SAM FEA^CISCO CALL, SUNDAY, SEPTEMBER 10, 1599.
SKAGUAY SHAKEN
BY A TEMBLOR
The Shock Lasted Fully
Three Minutes.
Special Dispatch to The -Call.
TACOMA, Sept. 9.â Skaguay experi
enced a shock of earthquake Sunday aft
ernoon. It moved south and north, and
lasted over three minutes. Houses were
shaken and pendant articles swayed like
pendulums. The only loss so far reported
was In the Skaguay brewery, where there
are four large tanks kept full of beer to
ferment. Over a barrel of beer was
sloshed out of each tank, and fully five
barrels were lost. The floor was five or
six inches deep with beer.
As to the extent of the area where the
shock was felt, opinions differ. Some
think it was local and did not reach far
in any direction, while one Skaguay citi
zen who has visited the Hawaiian Island 3
has the temerity to prophesy that these
islands have been swallowed up by the
sea. He maintains that heretofore all
earthquakes there have had motion from
east to west, and that it has been claimed
that the Islands are so constructed that
a north to south earthquake would cer
tainly topple them into the sea.
It is known that the volcano of Ma
kushln is in eruption on Unga Island, sev
eral hundred miles to the westward of
Lynn Canal, and many believe there is
connection between these two seismic dis
turbances.

FRITZ SCHEEL SURE
TO REMAIN EAST NOW
:hosex symphony leader by
philadelphia people.
Ferdinand Stark Will Return This
Month â Bostonians Accept Miss
iloliere's Libretto.
Once more the original statement of a
certain change in musical circles has
proven correct as announced in this col
umn. Ir. The Call of August 13 it was
set forth that Fritz Scheel would remain
In Philadelphia and be the successor to
W. W. Giichrist, who had resigned. This
announcement evoked a storm of protests
amor.- certain musical people, who claim
ed that heel hid written to friends
h'rre that he would arrive on the
2^th day of this month. And now a
telegram to a:. Eastern profess. onal pa
per makes this positive assertion: "Fritz
Scheel, the brilliant musical director,
has been secured by the Symphony
Society of Philadelphia to conduct it&
concerts. A number of ... citi
zens made it possible by large subscrip
tions for the society to engage so capable
an artist. Scheel will now organize a new
orchestra and during the winter gi; - c a
series of concerts." '.â -- cannot be any
question as to the veracity of this tele
gram. A conversation with one of the di
rectors of the local symphony society
brought the supposition that this move of
Scheel'fl will deprive San Francisco of its
symphony concerts, as the Increased rate
of the musicians and a new conductor
would not prove a financial success.
Hence the Philharmonic Orchestra which
is to be reorganized under the direction
of Herman Genss will be the only body
upon which this city must depend for
good orchestral cor.c-
Ferdinand. Stark, who has made himself
so popular while playing at the Zinkand,
and who will scon conclude a successful
engagement at Colorado Springs, will re
turn to this city on September 23 and re
sume his former position on September
3u. He will begin with an enlarged or
chestra, and it is the sense of the manage
ment to have concerts equal in quality of
music to those given in the most promi
nent of Germany's "Rathskeller."
The Bostonians have accepted a libretto
by BIi3S M Here of this city. The libretto
Is intended for a three-act comic opera
and bears the title of "The Kossacks."
It deals with the siege of Moscow and pic
tures the victory over the French in Rus
sia. The music will be composed by Jacob
Minkowsky, who resided in this city for
some time last year and whose opera.
"The Smugglers of Badayez," will be pre
sented in Troy, N. V., on September 18 by
the Bostonians.
The Philharmonic Orchestra, under the
direction of James Hamilton Howe, has
commenced Its rehearsals for this season
and from all appearances It will prove a.
prominent factor In the musical life of
next season.
Harry Campbell, the energetic and pop
ular musical manager, has resumed the
position of treasurer at the Grand Opera-
House. where he will no doubt add to his
reputation as a conscientious and capable
young man.
Of utmost importance to the musical
circles is the unusually large and meaty
bill at the Tivoli next week. Never in
the history of local music were such two
works presented in one week as "Lohen
grin" and "Othello." The fact that the
cast for these operas has been care
fully selected should insure an artistic as
well as financial success. Berthald as Lo
hengrin Mertlns as Telramund and Mary
Linck as Ortrud will make a splendid
combination. The same may be said of
Avedano as Othello and Salassa as Jago.
Miss Prossnltz. whose E!sa received i
many complimentary notices abroad, will
do doubt be approved by the public here.
The musical services at the various syn- :
agogues for the Day of Atonement on :
Thursday next promise to be very elabo- j
rate arrÃ interesting. E. J. Stark has pre
pared a particularly artistic service for
Temple Emanu-El.

Sad Death of a Cannery Girl.
OAKLAND, Sept. 9.â The death of little i
Slary Silva, aged 14 years, which occurred \
at her home, corner of Second and Alice
streets, last night, is particularly sad
from the fact that her great desire to help
support a large family was almost directly
the cause of her taking oft". At her own
suggestion she sought and found employ
ment in a local cannery a few weeks ago.
While she was pealing fruit with a knife
the blade supped and she sustained a cut
on her left hand. It did not bother her
much and tittle attention was paid the
wound, but it grew worse, and about a
week ago she had to quit work. Dr. Strat
ton was sumomned and soon diagnosed
her case as lockjaw, from which she died.
DISAPPEARANCE OF A

OAKLAND. Sept. 9.â William Ring, a

reported to the police authorities, and the
employers are making an effort to bring
the young man back in crder that he may
be given a chance to redeem himself. It
is whispered that there is some woman in
the case, and Ring's employers say they
have no desire to prosecute him.

from instant death this morning. Young
Wilson and his cousin, Charlea Slater,
aged 13. were scuffling over a revolver
when the weapon was accidentally dis
charged, inflicting a painful though not
serious wound over the heart. The ball,
thirty-two caliber, entered at a point di
rectly over the heart, but striking a rib
glanced off to one side and Imbedded it
self in the flesh. Drs. Pond and Lubbock
attended the child, but as there are
no signs of internal hemorrhage the
physicians do not anticipate any seriou3
consequences.

IRATE HUSBAND
ORDERED OUT AT
POINT OF PISTOL
Sensation at Charles
CahiiTs Home.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
SOS Broadway, Sept. 9. .-
There was an exciting scene at the resi
dence of Mr. and Mrs. Charles Cahill at
Dlraond, in Upper Fruitvale. last night,
arousing the whole neighborhood, and for
a time it was thought that some one
would be most seriously damaged.
The domestic differences of the Cahills
have taken a new and serious turn, and
what will develop out of last night's
scene would be difficult to speculate upon.
It appears that Mrs. Cahlll had been at
tending a Salvation Army campmeetlng
at San Jose the past week or so and ar
rived home last night. Shortly afterward
Mr. Cahill, returning from the city, was
surprised to find his home and family In
the possesion of William Sinklostz. a Sal
vationist, who he claims has been show
ing considerable attention to his wife of
late, and who had also attended the camp
meeting at San Jose.
Sinkiostz showed no inclination to ac
knowledge the arrival and presence of the
husband, who in a fit of fury ordered him
out of his castle, but not without dire
results, for. according to Cahill, Sinkiostz
promptly rallied from a sound trouncing
given him and, still refusing to leave the
Cahill residence, turned the tables by
whipping out a revolver and at the point
of the weapon ordering Cahill to quit his
own home.
The sadly abused husband ran post
haste to the headquarters of Deputy
Sheriff Quinlan, nearly a mile away, and
briefly and almost breathlessly presented
an outline of his grievances, of Smkiostz's
trespass and his wielding a revolver in a
threatening manner. The officer accom
panied him back to his home and imme
diately placed Sinkicstz under arrest. He
was charged with battery and disturbing
the peace and spent the night in the
County Jail.
What adds to the interest of the merry
row Is the fact that Mrs. Cahill called
at the County Jail to-day and secured the
release of her Salvationist friend by put
ting up $20 bail for him in each 'case.
Sinkiostz has now retaliated by swear
ing to two similar complaints, substitut
ing for his name as accused that of Ca
hill. his erstwhile accuser. Naturally,
some vastly more interesting develop
ments are awaited.
CLIMATE OF SAN FRANCISCO.
Professors McAdie and Willson Pre
paring a Paper on the Subject.
Section Official Alexander McAdie. in
charge of the local weather bureau, and
Forecast Official G. H. Willson are prepar
ing a joint paper on the climate of San
Francisco which will be completed in
about three â¢weeks. It will prove very val
uable, treating as it does of the tempera
ture, humidity and wind velocity of this
section during the past fifty years.
In discussing the subject yesterday
afternoon Professor McAdie said:
"Since the bureau has been taking ob
servations at the top of Mount Tamal
pais some pertinent results have been ob
tained. For example, in the month of
June of this year there was found to be
a mean daily difference of 11.4 degrees,
or in other words, from the data obtained
by means or" this mountain station,
checked by data from Point Reyes and
Mount Hamilton, the temperature rose
at the rate of 1 degree for every 303 feet
of elevation.
"It was also noticed that periods of
rainy, or cloudy and cold weather, occur
when the surface temperatures are higher
than those of the upper level. Fogs seem
to occur when the temperature of the
2500 feet level is considerably higher than
at sea level.
"In this connection the important con
clusion to be drawn is that the summer
fog's of San Francisco result from the
chilling of the upper warm air over the
ocean by the water, particularly the cold
current close to the shore. The strong
indraft through the gate on summer
afternoons carries with it the fog. The
movement of the lower fog-laden air east
ward and into the valley is compensated
by a westward air movement at higher
levels. The great dlffei of tempera
ture between the valley and the ocean,
often 50 degrees within as many miles, is
probably trie prime factor in controlling

THE SECRET DOSSIERâ A collection
of more or less private documents bear

the War Office has manufactured any
more forgeries, mentions Dreyfus by

THE PETIT BLEUâ A telegram found
at the German Embassy, written by Col

Military Attache, to Esterhax; inviting
him to "call. It It was torn up, the writer

it This Esterhazy contends is a forgery.
THE WEYLER LETTERâ A forged
letter, incriminating Dreyfus, sent to me

CE CANAILLE DE D . . .âA phrase
in one of the documents of the secret dos

THE "DOCUMENT LIBERATEUR"â
In other words, that beginning "Cc ca
naille de D . . ."âwas the famous one
which Esterhazy threatened Felix Faure
he would disclose unless protected against
Picquart. He alleged it had been stolen
by Picquart for a foreign embassy. Ester
hazy eventually returned it to the War
Office, after It had served its purpose.
LIEUTENANT COLONEL PICQUART

M. ZOLAâ The novelist, published his
now famous letter of accusation ("J'Ac

staff, accusing them, in point of fact, of
a gigantic conspiracy to convict Dreyfus.
Put on trial, convicted, fined and sen

and his sentence was quashed. Again

cle which barred any reference to the
Dreyfus case. Hence he permitted judg

demned, left the country, appealed and
lived in England, returning only recently
to France. His celebrated denunciation
is now proved to have been founded on
absolute truth.
COMMANDANT FORZINETTIâDirec
tor of Cherche Midi Prison, where Drey
fus was first confined. He denied the
prisoner made any confession, and event
ually, for affirming a belief in his inno
cence, fell into disgrace.
If. MATHIEU DREYFUSâ brother
of the captain, was one of the pioneers of
the campaign for revision. It was he who
first denounced Esterhazy as the writer
of the bordereau,
COUNT WALSIN-ESTERHAZYâ A sol
dier of fortune of the shadiest type, was
one of the chief opponents of Dreyfus. M.
Mathieu Dreyfus having denounced him
as the writer of the bordereau, he was
tried and acquitted, amid an anti-Jewish
manifestation. Subsequently arrested on
a charge of forging the "Speranza" and
"Blanche" telegrams, but liberated on a
technical point. He was, however, ex
pelled from the army, and has since gravi
tated â  between Holland, London and
Paris, now fully admitting he wrote the
bordereau by desire, and now denying he
ever said so. There is little doubt he
did write it. With Dv Paty de Clam he
stooped to any anti-Dreyfus trick, no
matter how mean, but he played all par
ties equally false.
M. SCHEURER-KESTNERâ The Sen
ator. The first public man who promi
nently took up the cause of revision (In
July, 1897). An able champion, who was
not afraid of consequences.
MAITRE FERN AND LABORlâCoun

pearing at Rennes.

Charavay,*t M. Teyssonnieret and M. Ber-
â¢All pro-Dreyfus. M. Charavay was at
first against Dreyfus, then changed his
views. AH the witnesses at the Zola trial
considered that Esterhazy wrote the bor
dereau.
IGave It as their opinion that Dreyfus
wrote the bordereau, the three called at
the Estetazy trial affirming that they be
lieved Dreyfus traced the bordereau from
Esterhazy's handwriting in order to con
ceal his own guilt and incriminate an
other. M. Bertillon lent the comic side
to the affair, drawing up a weird design
of a fortress with defenses to indicate his
views on calligraphic differences. It was
received with shrieks of laughter at the
Zola trial, and utterly discredited his
view. None of the experts favoring
Esterhazy are men of much repute.

INVITATION TO A BALL FIFTY YEARS AGO.
S3 i^"\UIETLY In her modest little room at 606 Folsom street, Mrs. A. 8. Tobln celebrated Admission day yesterday, 8o
j; I living- over again the joys of the past and especially reveling in the remembrance of the ball In honor of the first jj
m M Admission day, at which she was one of the half-dozen ladies present. It is so long ago that Mrs. Tobin does gg
*Â° not recall the hall at which the ball took place, nor the names of the other ladies who shared with her the '
S* pleasures of that historical event. "I can only remember that there were a great number of men present," the lady *"
83 said yesterday, "and that each lady had at least three partners for each dance. On the floor committee, see," she 8?
JJ continued with a sigh, "are the names of those who made this State's history. All famous men and now all passed Â§5
of away." gj
Mrs. Tobin arrived in San Francisco on the 2d of September, ISSO, and has ever since continuously made her home â.

SOME SPEEDY
SAPLINGS IN
PRODUCE STAKE
Recording Angel Develops Won
derful Fleetness and Is Now
Played for Second Choice.
A big crowd went out to Union Cours
ing Park yesterday to witness the llrst
round for the rich Produce stake, in
which fifty-eight young longrtails were
entered, and also the first round In the
open stake, with its sixty-four entries.
The number of spectators established a
new Saturday record for attendance at
the coursing park, a condition due chiefly
to the interest excited in the Produce
stake. A pretty stiff wind was blowing
across the grounds, having a tendency to
make the courses somewhat short, but
the sport was of an exceptionally high
standard, and the splendid work of the
dogs created unbounded enthusiasm.
J. H. Perigo's Bohe, the stake favorite,
was in line form, and disposed of Lucre
tla Borgia in masterly style. He is liable
to have his work cut out for him to-mor
row, however, as there are several unu
sually "good ones" after first money. The
figures on the long odds book are: Bohe
1 to 1, Recording Angel 4 to 1, Whitehead
5 to 1. Daisy Clalr 6 to 1, Master Clair 6
to 1, and the rest ranging from 10 to 40
to 1.
Recording Angel is possessed of won
derful speed, and her performance yes
terday, when she easily disposed of Con
troller, caused her owner, J. H. Rosslter,
to do a cakewalk in front of the grand
stand so great was his delight. Con
troller is a full brother to Bohe, twice as
old as Recording Angel, and is regarded
as a dangerous competitor for the best
of them, but Recording Angel led him to
the hare by six lengths and beat him out
in a manner that seemed to clearly estab
lish her superiority. She opened at 20 to
1 but was played down to 4 to 1. Her
lack of age and experience may tell
against her to-day, but she has the speed
and should prove a crackajack in time,
whatever position she captures in the
stake now being contested.
As a general thing the favorites won
yesterday; few short-enders got the Hag.
in the Produce stake Royal Ann beat
Aeneas at 5 to 2; Torment beat Tallac at
6 to 3; Athena beat Flying Fox at 3 to 1:
Master Workman beat May Hemstead
at 5 to 3; Random Aim beat Rough Rider
at 2 to 1; Maggie N beat Rosie Clair at

Coursing Park were treated to a good
day's sport yesterday. Two stakes were
runâ the Non-winner's stake of ninety-six
dogs and the Champion stake of sixteen
dogs. The hares were an exceptionally
lively lot and in most of the courses gave
the hounds long runs.
The betting was very spirited through
out the day, and although the favorites
won In most courses still some good long
shots upset the talent, the best being the
win of Moran & O' Neil's Irene H from
Mialmo. as good as 7 to L In his run
against Richmond Maid, J. Kane's Crusoe
got cold feet after a few yards' run and
ijuit. The finals in both events will be

GUNMEN SMASH
BLUEROCKS AT
ALAMEDA POINT
The brilliant shooting of Clarence C.
Nauman under circumstances that can
not be considered more than ordinarily
favorable was the feature of the Empire
Gun Club holiday match held at Alameda
Point yesterday. During the forenoon
Nauman broke ninety-nine bluerocks out
of 100 thrown from the trap. From early
morning until sunset bluerocks were
smashed by the contesting gunners. Four
(â -vents out of five on the programme were
shot off, and to-day four have >een ar
ranged for the pleasure of the contest
ant?.
The first event was one of fifteen birds;
entrance 75 cents; class shooting; three
moneys. Nauman and B. Sehultz tied
with a clean score in this event and di

The third event was for twenty birds,

The fourth event occupied the interest
of all the gunners present, as it was the
only prize match on the programme.
Prizes of various values were put up by
the club and local business houses. The
gunners were divided into thirteen classes
and the game for the prizes commenced.
They stood six In a row facing the traps
and for two hours shells exploded with
the even cadence of a machine gun.

birds from which the gnnners were
classified follows: V. La Motte 17, Hine

The day was an ideal one for a shoot,
but owing to the length of the contest
the gunners became tired. Notwithstand
ing: this, the average made by the Bports
men was good, but all, with the usual
excuses for yesterday's performance,
promise to lay all past efforts In the
shade.

EASTERN MARKETS.
New York Stock Market.
JCEW YORK, Sect. J.â Stocks showed some
Â§ <::s of firmness In the flrst hour of the trad
ing and up to the hours of the publishing of
the back statement. The movement in railroad
stocks wad exceedingly narrow, and lhe pell-
Ing movement, though not very passing, was
ruffleient to bring The genera] level of prices
below those of last nlcht. Tennessee Coal con
founded tne bears by soaring an additional 7
points upward, and after reacting SV4 recov
ered to within 2 points of the top. Colorado
Fuel continued to show close sympathy and
was up over - : â¢before the late reaction.
Adi to these a continued large demand for
Manhattan and sympathetic strength in Met
ropolitan and Brooklyn Transit and good gains '
la International Paper, Union Bag and Paper !
and Lackawanna, the points of extraordinary
strength In the market are about exhausted. j
The London Exchange was closed for a house
cleaning, and the recent depression from that
erjrce was lacking. Paris was looked to for a ;
reflection of foreizn sentiment, and the view
. there seemed to bÂ«i a cheerful one. In view |
o; the i>essircisti3 forecasts that have been
hiard all week regarding the bank statement ;
thÂ» "â - had a feeling early to the session
that .â  -. poor statement had been more than
discounted and were inclined to cover. Bat
the statement showed a loss in cash c: $2,CW.
--. 000 over the previous' estimates. The comparl
. &:n is. the average total of cash for sixty days
xvjth the average for the preceding six business
. days. AY the- totals" have b^eft en a lessening

â¢total. The contraction of Â»6.iJ15,700 In loans re

South will .contlnu? and no Increase in cash '

It is:, evident, therefore; that the -process of

.' t>as*3 on the publication of the annual report
â¢ and was niot-t ' Influential in its effect on the
â .general 'list! The large increase in nearly
every branch of the exceedingly varied traf
fic of the great system, the extensive im
â¢ menu and the betterments effected dur
â¢ ing the ear and large surplus of earnings
'carries forward, even after the generous allot
ment to the cost of improvements from cur
" rent â¢ earnlncs, : a '.- a most hopeful 6howing
â  of the condition of the transi>ortation lndus
â  try an.3 had an inevitable effect on prices of
ail railroad securities. The conditions in the
market have caused greatest caution during the
.past weÂ»k. The downward course of the cash
â reserve "item of the New York Clearing-house
banks had made little, effect for several weeks
past. . . - â  ". " " : '
It has been argued that there was plenty
of money available which did not show in the
wÂ»ek!y Clearing-house statement. The many
new trust' companies which have been organ
ized ; and the insurance companies have been
pointed out as sources of supply, which were
not Indicated in the Clearing-hous* statement.
The fact that banks in the Western cities i
which have been bidding far mercantile paper
in the .New Y.^rk market was cited as evidence
that the interior was supplied with money to
move the crops and need not call on New
York. Deposits of Western and Southern banks
Jn New York bonks have been transferred on a
large scale to ether Eastern cities, owing to
the recently enforced rule of New York banks
to charge for collections on outside checks, ana
this was expected to shift whatever demand
misht come from the West and South for
nvney upon other cities. And the conviction
has been general that gold exports were an
available means of relief whenever it was de
sired to call home our foreign credits. There
Is ground for the prevailing belief on all those
points, but nevertheless New York exchange
at Interior points has continued downward
an* the shipments or currency to New Orleans
have commenced this week as usual at this
period of the year. The balance of the cur
rency movement has been largely in favor of
the Interior and the sub-treasury is still mak- ,
ing large inroads on the cash resources of New
York banks on account of payments of taxes.
~ he banks' surplus r'-Â«rvÂ»?, already low. are
thus tending fast toward trie vanishing point.
The sterling exchange rote showed no dispo
sition to yield until late In the week, in spite
of th" hardness of money here, as the London
market was preparing Itself for the Increasing
probability of war. If gold Imports should be
'A-ced under these circumstances it is certain
that American securities would be sent home
to market on a laree scale. It will be re
membered that the treasury came to the relief
S the money market last September by antici
rÂ«'ing th " redemption of maturing bonds and
acc^ufns interest and by increasing deposits
Â»t dei>Â£i*Â«rv banks. It Is the hope of flnan
c'al St^lm that some such measures of relief
wfli nSw be adopted by the treasury- Other

NEW YORK, Sept. The Financier Bays: J
The surplus reserve of the New York clearing- ;
house banks, to all intents and purposes, was !
j practically wiped out by the operations of the |
I -week ending September 9.
j The city institutions are loaned to the limit
1 and the loss of $10,571,000 cash, which Is an
amount larger than the excess reserve reported
. for the previous week, was made possible only
Iby a heavy contraction In loans. The reduc- j
| tion of over fifteen millions in deposits lessened
i the reserve liability by over three and three- !
! quarter millions, so that despite the tightened j
position In which the banks find themselves j
the situation has been ably met. In many :
ways present monetary conditions are anamo- I
lous. With reserves lower than at any time
since 1593 money here has not exceeded an j
average of 4 per cent, and there seems to be !
'no trouble in securing accommodations. The
' explanation is found in the outside loaning
lat this center. Despite the fall of domestic |
i exchange rates to a point that indicates a \
j continuation of the outward movement New j
York Is being visited regularly by Western j
1 bankers who are Investing their available
I surpluses In giltedged securities or putting '
out idle funds In other directions here. Since
July 1 the New York banks have lost about
i $30 000 000 in cash and they are now facing a
' period when further drains are to be expected.
it stands to reason that the fulfillment of these ;
demands Is impossible unless loans are heavily
i contracted or new supplies are found. The
! logical relief is to be found In gold Imports, j
: which in past seasons have been always looked I
1 forward to. Whether the. same custom will J
I prevail this year cannot be stated, but cir
-1 cumstances certainly favor that prediction. It j
i Is not Impossible that treasury operations may
Ibe adjusted and afford some relief. Looking
! at the situation m a broad light, however. It
is best described as interesting rather than
â¢ critical The country is not suffering from a
â â  lack of funds, even if the New York reserves
do Indicate it. The prosperity of the country
has resulted in a much wider distribution of j
fun's than ever known before and this ex- j
plains In large part New York's exhaustion of
banking surplus to-day.

Chicago Grain Market.
CHICAGO, Sept. Wheat opened weak at
a decline of about %g?Â»c. Receipts of wheat in
the Northwest were much heavier than a week
ago. and Liverpool was lower. The general
! trend of the market has been downward for
i several days, and this sort of news easily put
the balance of trading on the selling side. The
I selling pressure at noon was quite heavy, but
l the demand was *o light that prices declined
1 steadily, weakness being especially marked in
i deferred futures. The market soon got under
! puts, and at that point became steady under
; fair buying against those privileges, but did
: not show signs of any reaction until late in the
session, when the report of the verdict In the
i Dreyfus case was posted and the excitement
lin Pans caused covering by shorts. Buying,
' however, was only sufficient to bring prices
. back to about yesterday's closing point. The
1 market was affected in a bearish way by the
Increase of 150,000 bushels In the European
visible for August, compared with a decrease
last year of T.W0.000 bushels. The big Russian
I stocks, 8,840,000 bushels, also came as a sur
' prise to traders and was responsible for some
1 IlquMatloa. Toward the close the market was
; practically at a standstill. Bearish statistics
' were expected Monday, and with this belief
! traders were disinclined to do much. Decem
: ber opened *Â«M4c lower at 71^1'sC It de
! clined to 70\wi70Sc and rallied to 71Vic, where
lit closed. September sold as high as iO?4Â®Â»0%o
I and closed unchanged at 7i.' l
' Corn was dull and heavy. The market got
i to both dally and weekly puts and had Â»omo
support on that account. December closed He
i Oats were fairly active and irregular. The
' close was about steady. December closed un- :
Changed and September lost He. 1" / â  ' r â 
Provisions still showed the effects of the yel- .
! low fever news and ruled slightly lower all
' around. Liquidation took place In all products,
: but the good cash demand for meats caused
â â  some rally late In the session. At the close
October pork and lard were 2^c lower and ribs
! a shade lower.

There is a general Impression on the
water front that the big log raft has been
picked up again by the collier Czarina
and the tug Fearless, and Is on Its way
to port once more. On Friday morning
It was seen adrift in latitude 3S degrees
42 minutes north, longitude 124 degrees 9
minutes west by the ship Oriental. It
was then intact and an American flag was
flying <>n It. At 10 p. m. the same day
the steamer Greenwood passed what the
captain took to be the Czarina with the
raft in tow ten miles southwest of Point
Arena, while at 8 a. m. yesterday the
Pomona, on her way from Eureka, passed
what the captain thought to be the raft
In tow of the Fearless and Czarina. This
was about seven miles northwest of Point
Reyes, but as there was a dense fog at
the time the captain of the Pomona 1h
not certain It was the raft he passed. The
steamer he sighted, however, was blow-

The ship Oriental is from Bristol Bay
and she had a narrow escape from the
raft. Had it not been for the American
flag flying from the end of it Captain
Parker is of the opinion that he would
have collided with it and perhaps sunk
his ship. There was nobody aboard the
raft and it was in good condition. The
Oriental was put about as booh as the
derelict was seen and just shaved the
mass of lumber a3 she answered her
helm.
The steamer President, alsg from Bristol |
Bay, picked the Uriental up off the light
ship and towed her in. Both vess< la came
in with their Hags at half-mast, as Cap
tain Schroder of the three-masted schoon
er Prosper died aboard the President at
6:20 a. in. on September 1. The captain
was taken sick at JKushagak, and turning
bis vessel over to the mate to bring down
took passage on the Pr< sident. The Ori
ental, President and Prosper are all of
the Alaska Packers' fleet, so Dr. Robin
son, one of the association's surgeons,
came down on the President to look after
Captain Schroder. Early on the morning
of September 1 he was taken with a
stroke of apoplexy and in Bpite of all the
doctor's care he died in a couple of hours.
The body was brought to San Francisco.
Captain Schroder was well known in San
Francisco and commanded vessels on the
coast for years.
The Oriental brought down 44,893 cases
of salmon frum Bristol Bay and the ship
America, which arrived about the same
time from Prince Williams Sound, brought
In 64,219 cases of salmon.
Some of the volunteer soldiers who came
home on the transport Sheridan are anx
iously lookii^g for a discharged soldier
named John Reynolds. About a half dozen
watches and some jewelry were missed
during the voyage from Manila, and Rey
nolds was suspected. He was placed un
der arrest, and yesterday Sergeant "Tom"
Mahoney of the harbor police was asked
to take him in charge. Mahoney said that
as the robbery occurred on the high seas
it was a ca.se for the United States Mar
shal. The latter could not bo found, as
it was a holiday, so Mahoney was again
sent for and he agreed to hold the pris
i ncr until Monday. However, when the
officers of the ship went to get Reynolds
he was missing, and a diligent search
failed to reveal any trace of him.
John Goldstone, a lumber clerk, lost
two of the fingers on hi.s left hand through
"a joke" played on him by a couple of
"friends" yesterday. The trio were In
Goldstone's room at 40 Spear street and
were examining a huge firecracker that

After their curiosity had been satisfied
they went on talking and Goldstone stood

MRS. TINGLEY MAKES
ANSWER TO ENEMIES
LEADER OF THE UNIVERSAL
BROTHERHOOD WRITES.
Tho Brilliant Lady Discusses Her
Travels and Dwells on One Who
Hounded Mr. Judge to
Death.
A grarbled extract ot a letter written by-
Mrs. Katherlne A. Tingley appeared re
cently in onÂ© of the morning papers and
put a wrong construction on statements
made by her In a private letter published
in London in the Crusader, and not the
New Century, as stated. It is claimed
that those investigating the statements
referred to have been engaged in an ef
fort to injure the movement of the Uni
versal Brotherhood, of which Mrs. Tingley
is the leader. The following letter writ
ten by Mrs. Tingley and published in the
Crusader shows that the aspersions made
by those people that she was using power
to destroy them is "cruel and false as it
is absurd":
OMAHA, JunÂ« Â», 1899.
To the Members of the U. B.:
Dear Comrades â I am sure you will be glad
to hear what a splendid solidarity and devotion
I am discovering among the lodges through
out the country. As I pass from place to place
It becomes more and more evident to me that
the trials and experiences of the past two years
have resulted In a remarkable purifying and
strengthening of our ranks. A more imper
sonal and truly brotherly spirit is especially
manifested by the real workers toward those
who have made mistakes and lost sight of their
duty. It is realized more and more clearly
that harm is done to our sacred cause by sus
taining erring members in their weakness and
folly, instead of maintaining a firm attitude
in defense of our great principles.
So great Is the expansion of our field of
work that I have been compelled again and
again to remodel the Itinerary In order to In
clude places where onÂ« or two have worked
devotedly for years, and have spread the prin
ciple* more, perhaps, than many a prosperous

the Courthouse of her city with a highly repre
sentative and Intelligent audience at barely
twenty-four hours' notice, the result being the
Immediate formation of a lodge.
Now you will not be disappointed that but
few particulars of this work appear in the
New Century, for you fully understand how
carefully I have to guard names and localities.
In order to protect the work from the at
tacks of Its enemies.
One very beautiful Instance of a calm, un
swerving trust especially touched me. In a
most promising 1 'Western city, although only six
had left the work, it was represented by cer
tain persons that the lodge was dead; yet
among those who had remained faithful I dis
covered one of the most beautiful souls In our
movementâ a saint-like old lady over eighty
years of age, one of the old pioneers who had
for the past fifteen years sustained the work,
helping with all her means the publication of
; the Secret Doctrine and other important work.
I In the absence of sufficient light when troubles
came, she simply said "I trust absolutely in
the great lodge and Its representatives, and I
! am Bure that I shall not be overlooked." ThuÂ»
i it became my happy privilege to meet this
beautiful soul and give her the help she needed.
Since then I have met three people who are
going to that city and will join her and her
comrades in forming a strong lodge. When I
sent Mr. Hanson ahead to engage a hall in
that city nothing was known of her, but the
man with whom he negotiated interviewed him
from the balcony of the very house in which
she lived. Thus the work is guided and cared
for all the time.
Swift and terrible, on the other hand. Is the
action of the law on those who have deserted
and turned against the work. One of them fell
dead in the street at Flushing â the place where
so many vile plots were hatchedâ and close to
the house where the child of another traitor
was burned alive, onl'- a partition separating
it from the arch traitor, then seated in his
private office. Not far off, at Staten Island,
the son of yet another was arrested on sus
picion of shooting a boy. These things are no
idle chances, but are terribly slgniflcent of the
sacredness and responsibility attaching to the
duties we have undertaken. No more awful
"dweller on the threshold" exists than that of
the renegade Theosophist, and it is time that
this is realized.
But the other side of the picture Is propor
tionately bright and beautiful. The ever
growing unity and trust must be a constant
Inspiration and encouragement to all my true
hearted comradesâ our successâ our success
â what better proof of it than the way It is
stirring up the enemy to pour forth their vlleÂ«t
calumnies. Witness the case of one who, in
my opinion, helped to persecute Mr. Judge to

Wholesalers' league Complains of
Action of Non-Subscribers.
The Manufacturers' and "Wholesalers'
League Is pleased over the success of the
first expedition of merchants and buy
ers from the country-. Inducements were
made to the Pacific Coast buyers to come
to this city to make their purchases of
goods, instead of sending to the East, and
the first lot consisted of about sixty visit
ors. These arrived on Monday on the
Ogden special, and yesterday the whole
lot were registered at the heauquarters
in the city Board of Trade rooms at 202
Market street. The gratifying -eature is
that the wholesalers have been able to
reach so far to the East as Montana,
Colorado and T'tah, and north to Wash
ington and Idaho. From all accounts
the visitors are making liberal purchases
here, and their verdict is that they can
make as good bargains in Snn Francisco
as elsewhere. Besides this they hare the
pleasure of a vacation, railroad fares at
half-rates for themselves and families,
reduced charges for board while here and
amusement in the theaters at half-price.
Since they have been here the officers ,
of the league have been annoyed at at- ]
tempts made by non-members trying to j
secure the trade of the visitors, thus de- |

It is simply Impossible to give an idea
of this man's charming manner In con
versation. The refined language, the
perfectly turned little French phrases
and expressions, and his gracious and
deferential air of courtesy showing tho
polished gentleman In every word and
gesture.
And such he was and is. The eon of
one of the first families of England ha
was educated at Wesley, In Sheffield,
Yorkshire, and is a fellow of that col

It was about this time that his father,
an extensive steel manufacturer, con
ferred with Bessemer for the purpose of
giving theories for a new and perfected
method of manufacturing stee.. It is
an absolute but hitherto unknown fact
that the process which made Bessemer
famous was not his own idea, but
bought from another and this other the

that he v.-ould like to continue the sub

."After dinner Bessemer and he had a
quiet conference; when my father, told
Bessemer there was one great fea
ture which he (Bessemer) had over
looked and which would be the perfect-
Ing point of the process, namely: an
increase of temperature by the means
which he (my father) only knew.
" 'And that?' said Bessemer.
" 'That requires a quid pro qua,' re
plied my fe.ther.
""And what might that quid pro quo
be?' asked Bessemer.
" 'That I shall be sole representative
of the- interest in the States.'
"To this Bessemer agreed as a fore

father revealed- the process, which has
made steel what it has been and is to

wealth, but tottering with age.
Time might have righted ail things
for this woman. and her lover and the
Jatter's story been totally different from
what It is, had the "Prince" not had a
brother Jealous .of the father's love for
this younger scion of the house.
An undercurrent of scandal doubtless
stirred London society while it held its
breath., and awaited developmentsâ
but it was the brother who made it ap
parent to the father that his-, son -had
disgraced the family, that it was due :
their sacred honor to turn him from
house and home.
Four hours were given him to leaveâ
three of the four were spent with his

made for a meeting in the Statesâ but
not successfully carried out. The usual

with an air of gentle tenderness and in
terested absorption that is very pleas
ant to watch:
"It was at this magnificent reception

the greatest beauty and wealth of New
York were thereâ chanced to be sur
rounded by a pay company of debu

'Come, we will be introduced to nion

never seen such charm and lovelinessâ
and I doubt if ho has seen greater

and the ghost of a smile Ultted across
Mr. Congreve'a face.
"Mack Kmmett, son of Judge Em.

led a german of a hur-ired couple* at
the jcean House, Newport, when fÂ«r
mans first came in vogue.
"Many a german I led for Mrs. Van

always called me by mv Christian
name, Walter, and I cam* and went
freely at her homo.
"It was at Mrs. Vanderbilt's I first
met and admired Elizabeth Clark,
Libble Clark as she was more familiar

Clark and I had togetherâ
balis, dinners. I became an intimate
at her home and â sweethearts. But
her mother grew ill and finally died.
Afterward I noticed her Badness, that
oecmed something more than her moth

and lovableâ '.Walter,' she Â«aid, ' I
promised mother on her deathbed I
would marry Air. Bradford and I can
not break my proniae' â and she did
not!"
The ' pause that followed was un
brokenâit was like standing by a grave
where words are useless, uncalled for,
for whatever Mr. CongTeve's life may
have had of wrong:, there at least tie
worshiped as at a shrine.
"Mr. Bradford? he was also a preat
friend of the family â old enough to be
her father. Bhe was unhappy, poor
girl. Either Mr. Bradford knew of her
promise to her mother and realized the
real cause of her unhappinesa, or he
comprehended nothing, for many times
after their marriage I was Libbie's es
cort to balls until once ha himself
asked me to escort his wife to a ger
znan. - * :'~.?:

rerman with your wife, will dance with
her, but don't you think you had better
take her yourself now?'
"He took the hint, I cared enough tÂ«
âbut that is en passant.
"Long Branch was gay, Newport de
lightful, but it was at Staten Island
that perhaps wo had the most truly
pleasant time. You have heard of Mm*.

Countesse dl Rosi? She was a charming
friend. And sing! ah, but she could

others had cottages there only a short
distance from Commodore Vtnderbllt a

The father and son often met and
were reconciled and the father 1 .- love
and advice often kept him from folly,
but &3 he himself worded it: "I needed
a mother's loveâ a mother's gentle in
fluenceâif I had had that I might not
have been the Bohemian and wanderer
I have been."
But the end of gay New York came
b.* last.

THEY EHJQY
INDEPEHBEHCe.
AFTER Mrs. Burton Harrison
wrote her story of "A Bachelor
Maid." the subject that had
given bo much occasion for talk nnd
newspaper discussion dropped Into
deeuoiud"'. It was Been that the bach
elor woman was not a fad; she really
existed and Intended to exist. Bo the
â world stopped railing: at her. and ac
cepted her as something that had to be.
X<>\v this case in I-ondon of Miss Inez
Broome, the pay and independent
bachelor girl of brains, means and ped
igree, has set the world a-talkinp; again
about the single woman who feels that
she has a right to do as she pleases
and art just as her brothers do.
It Is true that Miss Broome has re
noun< â â â ] her bachelorhood. She has
married a brother of the noble Craven,
who some years back wedded the New
York heiress, Miss Bradley- Martin. But
the bachelor maid who became a bride
hus not renounced her Independence;
Bhe has simply elected to be her hus
band's chum and comrade for life. It
Is not likely that we shall ever hear of
any American bachelor woman going
to such extremes in her assertion of in
dependence as did the gay Miss
Broome. She. perhaps, shocked the
proprieties a trifle too far. Neverthe
less, she served to bring the fascinating
woman bachelor once more into promi
nence.
The popular idea of the bachelor girl
In the minds of those who "do not
know," ho "do not understand," Is a
young woman who laughs at conven
tionality, smokes cigarettes and drinks
cocktails all day, and who is both bold
and coarse. In reality the bachelor girl
Is neither bold nor coarse; for the
former, substitute Independent. In re
gard to the latter, she is certainly not
one of those who mistake prudishness
for modesty, yet she is withal refined.
And she is feminine, fascinating and
sweet.
The feminine bachelor is very much
misunderstood by her married sisters;
also by those of her women relatives
ho are not bachelors. Somebody has
defined the difference between an old
maid and a bachelor maid as lying in
this: The former is still looking out for
a hut-band, while the latter is perfectly
satisfied to live without one. Probably
the distinction is not exactly this, but
j something sufficiently near it. The
bachelor woman would not take "any
>eld thing" as a- husband rather than go
: without. If she marries she wants a
friend, a companion, a man who is her
equal in brain, heart and soul. If Fhe
never meets this ideal she can still be
happy. She Is not always a worker;
she may be a society girl. But what
ever she is, she is an admirable type of
the best in womanhood.
In New York you find no end of these
women bachelors. Sometimes they live
In flats, en duo, en trio, or in quintets
;< or sextets. They go to places of amuse
*ment without male escorts end fear Is
â¢ to them a term unknown. All ranks
of society have representatives among
these bachelors and they represent all
the professions. They do not disdain
men; no, they have plenty of masculine
friends. But they meet on equal
ground. The men respect and like these
women, like them all the better, per
haps, because they know they are not
expected to fall in love with them and
propose matrimony because they hap
pen to express a fondness for their so
ciety.
They do fall in love sometimes, of
course they do. And when the bachelor
girl marries she usually makes the very
best kind of a wife. She appreciates a
good husband, and, because she is not
â willing to be his slave, that does not
make ncr the less dutiful and careful
of his comfort.
Ask the bachelor maid if she ever
thinks of marriage, and she usually
Bays: "Oh, yes; sometimes." But her
single blessedness does not disturb her
tranquillity.
It is a matte*" of Interest to con over
the names of gome ef our local bachelor
women. We can show none of the
Broome order, but many charming
young women who believe that inde
pendence is a pleasant possession, and
who are In no hurry to change the
prefix â¢ Miss' 'to "Mrs."
All over California one can find these
happy bachelor girls, some of them In
public life, but many more "in society."
The latter are usually interested In
clubs of culture, or music, or painting,
but all represent line types of Cali
fornia;) young womanhood.

OFFICIAL and social circles in
Washington are much interested
In the news that Prince Henry of
Prussia, brother of the German
Emperor and commander of the
German squadron in the Pacific, intends to
visit San Francisco on his flagship, the
D-utschland, after he leaves China, and
that he may thence so by rail to \V ashlng
ton in compliance with an invitation re
cently extended to him by President M â 
Kinley. â  .
The general opinion among those who
know the Prince Is that he will not lose
this opportunity to become acquainted
with the capital city of America, and the;.
are or this opinion because they know
that the Prince, ,ugh a born seaman
and never so happy as when on board of
his flagship, is also a keen student of men
and manners and has from his earliest
years at sea loved to take inland journeys
whenever his professional duties permit
ted him to do so.
Constant activity, indeed, hi a marked
characteristic of Heinrich the Navigator,
&s his own people love to call him. Born
on August 14, 1562. he entered" the navy
while still a lad, and most of his time
eince then has b^en spent at sea. He rose
rapidly in his profession, and ev>n as tar
back as ten years ago thoughtful Germans
prpdictr-d that he would some day be the
a<imir:il of the German navy.
Not only, as all the m rid knows, is he
a distinguished seaman: he Is al3o a
scholar of no mean repute and a mu
sician of more than average ability. On
questions of state his views are almost
always considered sound, and in all inter
national questions that in any way affect
Germany's welfare no one takes a deeper
Interest than he.
In 1887 Prince Henry went- a- wooing,
and a year later be took home to Berlin
as his wife Princess Irene, third daughter
of the Grand Duke Louis of Hesse and
Princess Alice of England. The Prince
had seen a g-oodly portion of the world
by this time. He knew his own country
well, and during 1883 and 1854 he spent
â¢ome time in Cuba and Bermuda.
rjurtn* the latter year he aLio visited
London, and while thv-* life very nearly
became the victim of a â  dynamite plot.
While he was in one of the upper rooms
at Paddington Station a dynamite bomb
exploded in a cloakroom Immediately be
neath the room occupied by him. and the
general opinion was that his escape from
death or serious Injury was little short of
miraculous.
In July. ISSS, he was made a commander
of the navy, and his next few years were
comparatively uneventful. He was almost
constantly at seaâ indeed, it is said that â 
of all the naval captains In the German
navy he is the only one who has been con- !
tinuously on board an Ironclad as com- '
mander since ISS2. This statement will be
more clear if we supplement it by saying
that Prince Henry, young- as he !s. has
spent more than twenty years of continu
ous service in the German navy.
During many of these y-ars the public
outside of Germany heard but little of him
or of his work, and it was not until the
winter of 1837 that he really came, to the
front In German .iffMr?. At that time ft
was announced that the Emperor Intend
ed to send his brother to China, with the
object of looking after the German Inter
ests in that country. This action on the
Emperor's part naturally aroused many
comments from the European press,
which was at that time devoting much at
tention to the relations existing between
the various European powers and China.
It is no wonder, therefore, that Prince
Henry's visit to China, was regarded as
an event of unusual significance. He ar
rived at Kiaochau in th- spring of 1593.
Â»nd thence he went to Peking, where a
brilliant official reception awaited him. .
The attention of Americans was espe
cially attracted toward him about this time
in connection with the so-called Irene In
cident A German vessel of this name
rave "-id to some Spaniards at Subtg Bay.
in the Philippine islands, and as this .
country was at'war with Spain at that ,
time there was an impression that such
action was not quite in accordance witn
the rules of neutrality. **_. ;
Prince Henry, however. In an official
statement, maintained that the Irene went
to Subig Bay to .take off some Spanish
women and children who were in distress
and that at Isla Grande the German war
ship met a vessel belonging- to the Insur
gents which, left without any difficult?. .
A PRINCETON HAM
EXPLORES PATAGONIA
WHILE the nation has been
thrilled for nearly l tvo years
with the heralding of feats of
American arms by land and
by sea, her intrepid scientists fcave
won renown in the field of re
search. The soldier and sailor give up

The party had traveled between 1280

had seen only a few human beings,
mostly Tehuelche Indians, along the
Atlantic coast.
At the Cordilleras,. Professor Hatch
er, taking a saddle hcrse and a pack
mule and only a small quantity of rice,
salt and pepper, bade his comrades
goodby for six week?. He Journeyed
entirely alone during that time and vir
tually without any provisions.
"I did not want to- be bothered," said
he, "with provisions. I can kill enough
in a day to last me for a month."
During the lonely Journey he trav
ersed 800 miles and slept in his blanket
with the thermometer 10, 15 and 20 de
grees below xero most of the time, and
with mountain lions arid tiger cats
prowling around. He did not see the

turning met outside Manila Bay two I
United States cruisers, which did not ;

tne removal of the women and children ;
"was effected from motives of humanity ,

Prince Henry recently succeeded Ad

entitled in the opinion '.<( those who know
how carefully he has looked after Ger
many's interests in China. That his i
brother, the Emperor, is satisfied with his
work Is evident and it is safe to say that
when he returns to Berlin he will receive
a right royal welcome not only from the
court but also from all classes of the
people.
Meanwhile let him be assured that he
will meet with an equally hearty welcome
if he should see fit to become President ;

ably as contented as if he had been
sitting in the study of his snug home in
Princeton.
He climbed th* Andes for many miles
and went over into Chilean Patagonia.
Some of the glaciers In the Cordilleras,
he says, are 50 miles long. .The scenery
is magnificent.
Ore of the grandest spectacles on the
Pacific Slope" is Lake Puerrydon,
which is surrounded by luxurious vege
tation. it is down deep below the vast
Andes and is only 430 feet above the
sea level.
Xear Lake Puerrydon Professor
Hatcher found a natural amphitheater,
whose slopes were 3000 feet high. Seats
were carved in the rock as if the place
had been intended for some immense
amphitheater.
It is Impossible to cross the Andes
and see the Pacific Ocean, otherwise
Professor Hatcher would have tried it.
Besides, he did not wish to be longer
away from his comrades, who might
fear if he prolonged his journey that
something serious had befallen him.
Professor Hatcher has an affection
for the Tebuelche Indians, who live Id
the southern part, or what is known a/
the Santa Cruz territory of Patagonia.
Most of his explorations have been con
fined to this territory- The Tehuelchr
Indians comprise nearly all the popu
lation of the Santa Cruz section of
Patagonia, which is as large" in area as
New England. There are not more than
a thousand persons in the territory.
They live on the Atlantic coast. The
furthest inland they go is about fifty or
sixty miles. The central part and the
Pacific slope of Patagonia are uninhab
ited.
The Tehuelche Indians are large and
powerful, being about six feet talL
They have splendid dispositions, are
peaceful and fairly industricrus. The
women are more industrious than the
men. The Indians are frank, generous
and hospitable, though they are not un
duly so. For instance, they expect a
reasonable compensation for what th-y
do and for their products.
A quart of whisky will go further
than many dollars. Professor Hatcher
would have been able to save quite a
sum of money if he had taken a good
quantity of whisky with him to Pata
gonia. The Indians are not cpuyrel
aome. They are kind to- one another.
Parents treat their children with great
tenderness.
"I never saw any children whipped,"
said Professor Hatcher. "Parents will
ike anything away from the chii
dfen unless the iatter are perfectly will
part with the articles. It cost me
ne niuney to buy a cradle
from an Indian. I had great difficulty
in obtaining it at that price.
'â If you go to them hungry they will
feed you. They live mostly on the
South American ostrich and the guan
aco, or camel. The camel is their main
stay. The animal gives them food and
raiment. Their cooking is not as clean
as you may desire, but when you are
â¢ here long you get used to it.
"The guanaco is about the size of a
yearling colt, or half again as large as
the Virginia deer. Its tax has a light
brown eolcr, except in the belly and
flanks, where it is beautifully white.
The Tehuelches make capas, or man
tles of the skin a.-d fur of the camel.
Th-y w~ar the mantles with the fur
next the body."
Professor Hatcher and his compan
ions sailed from Port GaHegos, which
is about thirty miles north of the
-3 of Magellan, in the latter part
of May. They went to Buenos Ayres.
Then Pro-fessor Hatcher took a trip up
the Parana River into Paraguay, where
he wished to pursue an investigation.
He went alone. He reached New York
about a week ago and immediately re
joined his family in Princceton.
The sci-rn.inc T /a!ue nf Professor
Hatcher's expedition is said to be great,
but of that he will not say a word. He
admits, however, that the geologtccal
and pala>- I specimens he ob
tained are interesting. Nearly every
genus is represent â¢! by one or more
skeletons in forms hitherto only knoÂ«wn
tn fragments.
He considers that the ail Important
part of the collection is some teeth
which belonged to mesozolc animaia.
Xo su<. h teeth had ever be^n found be
- nth America.
Doubtless if you saw the man who
made this expedition a success you
wtrnld never take him for a scientist or
a university prof^sssor unless you
talked with him. He is a diamond in
the rough. You might take him for an
intelligent backwoodsman or a typical
rawboned Westerner â a man something
after the style of Daniel Boone. He is
a little above medium height, with a
broad chest, and is slightly bald. His
chin is fairly large, and the frank ex
rr-s*kn of his countenance reveals his
sterling character. His words are few,
snd his modesty approaches shyness.
The chances are that he will feel un
easy it you compliment him, and no
person can scarcely be more averse to
being brouzht into public print than
this "man who in the fhterest of science
was help. - back in the snowy
wastes of Patagonia for nearly two
months without any medical aid and
with only one companion. The world
loves such a man and the modesty

Sood Coffee.
How to make good coffee is one of the
problems Ftldom solved In domestic life.
The coffee belongs to the ehlncona
family. The leaves are light-grren and
about five Inches long-- The flowers are
white, very fragrant and grow In clust
ers. The fruit Is at first green in color
and then when ripening turns from preen
to red. The fruit contains two seeds,
grown tight together. These seeds are
the coffee beans.
Purchase your coffee freshly roasted,
grind it or "have It ground and mixed
with, that is If you like, the proper pro
portion of chicory. Keep the ground cof
fee in air-tight glass lars so that none
of Its flavor Is lost. The addition of
chicory Is merely a matter of taste.
Eight out of ten" people dislike it and
won't drink coffee which contains it.
That Is. If they know it. Pure Java or
Java and Mocha mixed are the best cof
fees.
Now for the coffee pot. To those who
like coffee made without an egg the old
fashioned filter pot Is used. Hut I main
tain and always will that coffee made
without eggs has a different flavor. It
in not so good. It lacks richness. So I
use the plain, every-day coffee pot. For
four people use a good-sized cupful of
coffee. Beat one egg and mix thoroughly
with the coffee. Put In coffee pot add
ing two cups of cold water. Allow to
come to a boil, then fill the pot with boil
ing water, allow to come to a boll once
more, then set on back of stove to set
tle. If It docs not settle readily enough
pour in a little cold water. Have the
coffee cups warm, pour in cold or hot
cream as you like and then the coffee.
Serve.
Just one more word. Be sure that the
water used in making coffee is fresh.
Never use water that has been boiled for
I any length of time. It makes coffee ln

Jke Midday
2y Marion Jtarlandr*
The word comes to us from the Span
ish, and is defined by our English lexi
cographers as "a shcrt midday nap.'' Ihfe
deeper root is in the Latin s^ssum, "to
sit," or sessita-re, "to sit long."
It suits riy present purpose to make n
composite of the definitions that snail
cover what the siesta should mean
and be:
"A pause in the day's occupations"
that shall knit up at least the cuff of the
raveled sleeve of care; a breathing spell
half way up the long hill of daily toil; a
loosening of the tension of the human ma
chine; an interim between forenoon and
afternoon, devoted honestly, openly ar.d
religiously to rest, pure and simple.
To do nothing confessedly and deliber
ately for an hour, or for half that time,
is an Impropriety in the sight of our aver
age housewife, a misdemeanor in the es
timation of her busy husband. He may
! whittle a stick and she twiddle her
; thumbs -while gossiping with a neighbor
for half as long again without offense to
conscience. Not one in five hundred of
either sex has the moral courage to say.
"I make it a rule to get an hour's char
rest after luncheon (or dinner) every day,
and I miss it sadly when I do not
j have it."
A woman upon whom I was urging the
siesta as a work of necessity and mercy
told me that she was "opposed upon prin
ciple to forming any habit the interrup
tion of which would make her uncom
fortable.
"If 1 take a rest at a certain hour every
day I should be sleepy always at that
! hour, and sometimes that would be incon
| venient, you know."
I retorted that the same objection ap
plied to the formation of any habit, such,
for instance, as eating one's luncheon or
taking a daily bath, or a brisk constitu
tional, or combing the hair, or brushing
the teeth.
I remarked, moreover, in my haste,
what I beg leave to repeat here at' my
leisureâ that, in my opinion, not one of
the practices I enumerated was more es
sential to my health of mind and body
than the midday rest hour. Were I

It should be a penal offense
to do any work of whatever de
scription between the hours of 2 and 3 In
the afternoon, and each man, woman and
child should rest apart from the other
members of the household. And after this
manner should the sanitary season be
spent.
Dealing with the house mother, as the
one most in need of this type of life pre
server, and the one whose example would
be most surely followed by the rest:
She must retire to her room and let
down her hair, exchange her dress far a
loose wrapper, when she has removed her
stays; don a pair of loose slippers, dis
pose herself as luxuriously as possible
upon bed, lounge or reclining chair, and
think of nothing, so far as in her Ht-s. for
the full number 'of minutes prescribed by
law. If she cannot make a vacuum of her
mini, let her read in moderation the
lightest novel she can lay her hands upon
without exerting herself to look for it.
She should empty her mind of care, turn
ing it upside down to drain out the dregs.
For the next hour she should belong en
tirely to herself, and have no earthly con
cern except to relax physical, mental and
moral muscles. If the light fiction should
interest her to the extent of making her
care "what comes next in the story" it
should be laid by as unfit for the pur
pose she has in hand. Presently she. will
grow drowsy; the book will slide from the

Leaving Utopia and theory, I would
observe that the length of tho slumberâ
the genuine "nap"â is not so important
as the reality of the loss of conscious
ness. Ten minutes will as surely ioosen
the invisible screw at the base of the
brain as an hour.
The busiest literary woman I know as
cribes the sustained vigor of bodily a-nd
mental powers that enables her to work
at sixty as earnestly and happily as at
forty to the siesta never intermitted, ex
cept under the stress of necessity, for
thirty-five years.
"I seldom really sleep a quarter of an
hour," she says. "Sometimes I only lose
myself for five minutes and awake, made
over. Then I have a rapid bath, dress and
am good for another half day's work."

into two words, "Lose myself."

pour in one quart of boiling hot vinegar.
Cover and lr-t stand two or three days.
Stir often. After the third day strain,
allow to settle and strain again. Place on
the stove, add four pounds of sugar and
cook until scum ceases to rise. Use to
pickle the following fruits:
PICKLED I'EAKS-Peel the fruit and
steam fifeen minutes. Then boil in the
pickle for a few moments: set away to
cool, and repeat the next day. Fill Jars
with them, seal and put away.
TOMATOES PICKLEDâ Use medium
sized, tirm tomatoes. Scald and skin
them. Place them in a large Bteamer
and cook twenty minutes; drop them in,
the pickle and cook from ten to twelve
minutes. Pack in earthen jars and cover
wiih tho pickle.
PICKI.ED PEACHESâ ScaId and skin
the peaches. Bring the pickle to a boll
and turn in the peaches. Boil six min
ut< b, pour off the pickle and boil it five
minutes, then pack the peaches in a jar
and cover with the pickle, seal and put
away.
PICKLED BLACKBERRIES-Brine
the pickle to a boil, add the berries and
cook slowly for fifteen minutes. Put in
glasses and set away. Blackberries pick
led in this way are very nice to eat with
mutton.
PICKLED APPLESâ Crab apples are
best, though the large everyday apples
may be used. If crab apples are used
wash them and boil until they are ten
der. Boil the pickle and pour it over the
apples. Allow to stand a day and then re
peat. After the second boiling of the
pickle place the fruit in jars and seal.
If after a few weeks or months the
pickles be covered with mold, strain off
the juice and boil, adding enough fresh
pickle to cover the fruit. Sometimes the
most carefully put up fruit proves a fail
urt. There la no telling why: it simply
does. As a rule the only remedy is re
cooking and immediate use.

of the New York Eclipse. She tella her father, one of the most learned
professors In a great Kaitern college, of hÂ»r Intention to marry Column, and
In spite of the fact that Coleman waa at one- time a favorite pupil the match
Is most bitterly opposed by him. He arranges a trip to Greece hoping to pre
vent the wadding. Coleman calls on Marjory for an answer to his suit. To
try his affection she treats him coolly and announces her trip to Greece. He
misunderstands, and the result Is they say good-'oy In a most matter of tact
manner, but Marjory rushes In tears to her father fully convinced that Cole
man does not love her. -while Coleman roes to the ciub and drowns his rrlef
In drink. The professor arranges to take seme Of hl3 students with his family
to Greece â amors them a young sophomore named Coke, who has distinguished
himself '.a a freshman rush and Is regarded by Coleman in the llffht of a
rival. Coleman rets an appointment as war correspondent of the Eclipse for
the war In iirpÂ«ee and sails via London. On the st-amer ha meets Nora Black,
a celebrated dancer and an old friend, who pays him marked attention.
Coleman rather slights the attentions cf the fair Nora and in turn Is him
self snubbed. He leaves London without tellies her road-by, although she sits
near him a: cupper, and from remarks she makes to her party he know? she
te fond of him. In Greece he learn* that the \Vair.-,v::grt party ire at Niicopolls
and In danger, so â -.- seta tat for that point at once.
Coleman finds the approach to Nikopo'.is surrounded with difficulties *nd no
traos of the Wainwrtghts. He receives a cables from the Eclipse to as
certain the whereabouts of the party at all haiards, as their position had
already created considerable comment 'â " Arrvrica.
He proceed* with a portion of the Greek cavalry toward Nlkopolis. The
Greek* hear of reverses and sudier.ly retreat, leaving Coleman and his drago
man to get back the best way they can. Ntcnt cemes en auJ by a queer
chance the Walawrlghta overtake Coleman on the road. They are unarmed
Â»nd in a state of trepidation. All are in dancer cf massacre by either Greek or
Turkish hillemen and the burden of taking tbe party to safety falls on Cole
man. The party proceeds on its way to Arta and ir.eets the Greek outpost,
but learns of farther dar.gers ahead. To the sunrise of all they meet Nora
Black with a party on the road.
[Continued.]
Coleman made the mistake of hesitating. For a fraction of a moment
he had acted as if he were embarrassed, and was only going to nod and
sa.y, "How d'do?"
He arose ar.d came forward too late. She was looking at him with a
menacing glance which meant difficulties for him if he was not skillful.*
Keen as an eagle, she swept her glance over the face and figure of Mar
jory. Without further Introduction the girls seemed to understand that
they were enemies.
Despite his feeling of awkwardness Coleman'a mind was mainly occu
pied by pure astonishment. "Nora Black?" he said, as if even then ha
could not believe his senses. "How in the world did you get down here?"
â¢ She was not too amiable evidently over his reception, and she seemed
to know perfectly that it was in her power to make him feel extremely
â unpleasant. "Oh* It's not bo far," she answered. "I don't see where you
come in to ask me what I'm doing here. What are you doing here?" She
lifted her eyes and shot the halt of a glance at Marjory. Into her last
question she had interjected a spirit of ownership in which he saw future
woe. It turned him cowardly. "Why. you know I was sent up here by
the paper to rescue the Wainwright party, and I've got them. I'm taking
them to Arta. But why are you re?"
"I am here," the said, giving him the most defiant of glances, "prin
cipally to look for you."
Even the horse she rode betrayed an intention of abiding upon that
spot forever. She had made her communication with Coleman appear to
the "Wain wright party as a sort of tender reunion.
Coleraan looked at her with a steely eye. "Nora, you can certainiy ba
a devil when you choose."
"Why don't you present me to your friends? Miss Nora Black, special
correspondent of the New York Daylight, if you please. I belong to your
opposition. I am your rival, Rufus. and I draw a bigger salaryâ acÂ«?
Funr.y looking gang, that. Who is the old Johnnie in the white wig?"
where you goin'â you can't"â blundered Coleman miserably.
"Awâ the army Is in retreat and you must go back â don't you see?"
"Is it?" she asked. After a pause she added coolly: "Then I shall go
back to Arta with you and your precious Wainwrights."
CHAPTER XVI.
Giving Coleman another glance of subtle menace Nora repeated, "Why
dor.- you present me to your friends?" Coleman had been swiftly search-
Ing the whole world for a way clear of this unhappiness. but he knew at
last thiit he could only die at his guns. "Why, certainly." he said quickly,
"if you wisn :t." He sauntered easily back to the luncheon blanket. "This
Is Miss Black of the New York Daylight, and she says that those people
on the mountain are Greeks" The students were gaping at him, and
Marjory and her father sat in the same silence. But to the relief of Cole
man ami to the high edification of the students, Mrs. Wainwrtght cried out,
"Why is she an American > man: 1 ' 1 And seeing Coleman's nod of assent
ehe rustled to her feet and advanced hastily upon the complacent horse
woraan "I'm delighted to see you. Who would think of seeing an Ameri
can woman way over here? Have you been here long? Are you going on
further? Oh we've had such a dreadful time." C< '.â¢â¢man remained long
enough to I . -..;â¢ Nora say: "Thank you very much, but I shan't dismount.
I "arrf going to ride back to Arta presently." . Â _.
Th*n he heartt Mrs. Wainwright cry: "Oh. you are indeed? Why, we.
too a'-f- going at orce to Arta. We can all go together. Coleman fled
â¢v e " n Vo" th* bosom of the students, who all looked at him with eyes of
cvr'cal penetration: He cast a glance at Marjory, more than fearing a
K'anc* which denoted an implacable resolution never to -forgive this thing.
On'rh* cortra-y he had never seen her so content and serene. "iou have
allowed your coffee to get chilled," she said considerately. "Won't you
havfl the man warm you some more?"
"Thanks, no." he answered with gratitude.
Nora changing her mind, had dismounted and was coming with Mrs.
Wa 1 -.wright That worthy lady had long had a fund of. information and
anecdote -the sound of which neither her husband nor her daughter would
endure f or a moment. Of course the rascally students were out of the
QusstJon Here en, was really the first ear amiably and cheerfully open
a-.d Â«he"was talking at what the students called her "thirty-knot gait."
"Lost evervtuiuW. Absolutely everything. Neither of us has even a
brush and mb, or a cake of soap, or enough hairpins to hold up our
hair. I'm going to take Marjory's away from her and let her braid her
hai ; down her back. You can imagine how dreadful it Isâ
Colrman broke -what imperiously into this feminine chat. "Well,
we mist be moving, you know," and his voice started the men into actlv-
Ity When the traps were all packed again on the horse Coleman looked
back surprised to see the three women engaged in the most friendly dis
cussion The combined parties now made a very respectable squadron.
Coipm.in rode off it its head without glancing behind at all. He knew
that they wre following from the soft pounding of the horses' hoofs on
the "od and from the mellow hum of human voices.
For a long time he did not think to look Hpon himself as anything but
a nan much injured by circumstances. Among his friends he could count
numbers who had lived long lives without having this peculiar class of mis
fort'jre come to them. In fact, it was so unusual a misfortune that men
of th* world had not found it necessary to pass from mind to mind a per
fect formula for dealing with it. But he soon began to consider himself
an extraordinary person Inasmuch as Nora Black had come upon him with
her saddle ..:s packed with inflammable substances, so to speak, and
there had been as yet only enough fire to boil coffee for luncheon. He
laughed tenderly when he thought of the Innocence of Mrs. Wainwright.
but his face and back flushed with heat when he thought of the canniness
cf the eight American college students.
He heard a horse cantering up on his left side and looking he saw
Nora Black. She was beaming with satisfaction and good nature. "Well,
jtufus." she cried flippantly, "how goes it. with the gallant rescuer?
You've made a bit, my boy. You are The success of the season."
Coleman reflected upon the probable result of a direct appeal to Nora.
He knew of course that such appeals were usually idle, but he did not
consider Nora an ordinary person. His decision was to venture It. He
drew his horse close to hers. "Nora," he said, "do you know that you
are raising the very devil?"
She raised her finely penciled eyebrows and looked at him with the
baby stare. "How?" she fr.oulred. â¢â  -
â¢'You know wel! enough." he gritted out wrathfuliy.
"Raising the very devil?" she asked. "How do you mean?" She waa
palpably Interested for his answer. She waited for his reply for an Inter
val, and then she asked him outright, "Rufus Coleman, do you mean that
I am not a respectable woman?"
In reality he had meant nothing of the kind, but this direct throttling
of a great question stupefied him utterly, for he saw now that she would
probably never understand him in the least and that she would at any
rate always pretend not to understand him. and that the more he said the
more harm he manufactured. She studied him over carefully and then
wheeled her horse toward the rear with some parting remarks. "I sup
r n S Â» you should attend more strictly to your own affairs. Rufus. Instead
of 'raising the devil I am lending hairpins. I have seen you insult people,
but I have never seen you insult any one quite for the whim of the thing.
Go soak your head."
Not considering it advisable to then indulge In such immersion Cole
man rode moodily onward. The hot dust continued to sting the cheeks of
the travelers and in some places great clouds of dead leaves roared in
circles about them. All of the Wainwright party were utterly fagged
Coleman felt his skin crackle and his throat seemed to be coated with the
white dust. He worried his dragoman as to the distance to Arta until the
dragoman lied to the point where he always declared" that Arta was only
off some hundreds of yards.
At their places in the procession Mrs. Wair.wright and Marjory werÂ»
animatedly talking to Nora and tha old lady on the little pony. They had
at first suffered great amazement at the voluntary presence of the old lady
but she was there really because she knew no better. Her colossal Ignor
ance took the form, mainly, of a most obstreperous patriotism, and Indeed
she always acted in a foreign country as if she were the special commis
sioner of the President, or perhaps as a special commissioner could not act
at all. She was very aggressive, and when any of the traveling arrange
ments in Europe did not suit her Ideas she was wont to shrilly exclaim
"Well â¢ New York is pood enough for me." Nora, morbidly afraid that her
expense bill to the Daylight would not be large enough, had dragged her
bodily off to Greece as her companion, friend and protection. At Arta they -
had heard of the grand success of the Greek army The Turks had no*t
stood for a moment before that gallant and terrible advance: no; they had
scampered howling with fear into the north. Jannina would fallâ
Jannina would fall as soon as the Greeks arrived. Th*re was no doubt of
it The correspondent and her friend, deluded and hurried by the light
hearted confidence* of the Greeks in Arta. had hastened out then on a reg
ular tourist's excursion to see Jannina after its capture Nora concealed
from her friend the fact that the editor of the Daylight particularly
wished her to see a battle so that she might write an article on actual
warfare from a woman's point of view. With her name as a queen of
conY opera such an article from her pen would he a burning sensation.
Pni.m 9 ? had been the first to point out to Nora that instead of going
en a Dicnic to Jannina she had better run back to Arta. When the old lady

"The idea'" she exclaimed to Mrs. Wainwright. "They might have caught

"\\ hy. so strange." choked Mrs. Wainwright. Nothing she knew or
Nora could account for her stupefaction and grief. What happened glar
ingly to her was the duplicity of man. Coleman was a ribald deceiver. He
must have known and yet he had pretended throughout that the meeting
was a pure accident She turned with a nervous impulse to sympathize
with her daughter, but despite the lovely tranquility of the girl's face there
- imetning about her which forbade the mother to meddle. Anyhow
Mrs. Wainwright was sorry that she had told nice things of Coleman's

Cowman."
"Why, how bo?" asked the old lady. â¢ ,
"Oh, really nothing. Only to us he seemed rather erâ prematurely
experienced or something of that kind."'
"The ol<l lady .lid not catch the meaning of the phrase. She seemed sur
prised. "Why. I've never seen any full-grown person in this world who
got experience any too quick for his own good."
At the tail of the procession there was talk between the two students
who had in chars.' the little gray horse one to lead and one to flog.
"Billie." said one. "it now becomes necessary to lose this hobby Into the
hands of some of the other fellows. Whereby we will Rain opportunity to

and Pete Tounley near Marjory- we'll calf 'em." whereupon he set up
a cry. "Say, you people, we're not getting a salary for this. Suppoeln'
you try for a time. It'll do you good." When the two addressed had
halted "to await the arrival of the little gray horse they took on glum ex
pressions. "You look like poisoned pups," said the student who led the
horse. "Too strong for light work. Grab onto the halter, now, Peter, and

"Good time you'll have, " answered Peter Tounley. "Coleman Is cot

"Nervy to what?" asked Billle.
"Well." said Coke, "seems to me he is playing both ends against the

The three other students expressed themselves with conviction and in
chorus. "Colrman's all right."
"Well, anyhow," continued Coke. "I don't see my wsvjr free to admir

"He didn't." said the others, still In chorus.
"Queer game," said Peter Tounley. "He seems to know her pretty
well."
"Pretty d well." said Billle.
"Anyhow, he's a brick." said Peter Tounley. "We mustn't forget that.
Lo, I begin to feel that our Rufus is a fly guy of many different kinds.
Any play that he Is in commands my respect. He won't be hit by a chim
ney in the daytime, for unto him has come much wisdom. I don't think
I'll worry."
"Is he stuck on Nora Black, do you know?" asked Billie.
"One thing Is p!.ain." replied Coke. "She has got him somehow by the
short hair and she Intends him to holler murder. Anybody can see that."
"Well, he won't holler murder," said one of them with conviction. "I'll
bet you he won't. He'll hammer the warpost and beat the tomtom until he
drops, but he won't holler murder."
"Old Mothnr Wair.wri?;ht will be In his wool presently," quoth Peter
Tounley musingly. "I could see It coming In her eye. Somebody has
given his snap away, or something."
"Aw. he had no snap." said Billle. "Couldn't you see how rattled he
was? He would have given a lac ;f dear Nora hadn't turned up."
"Of course," the others assented, "he was rattled."
"Looks queer. And nasty," said Coke.
"Nora herself had an ax ready for him."
They began to laugh. "If she had had an umbrella she would hare
basted him over the head with It. Oh, my! He was green."
"Nevertheless," said Peter Tounley, "I refuse to worry over our Rufus.
When he can't take care of himself the rest of us want to hunt cover.
He Is a fly guy."
Coleman in the meantime had become aware that the light of Mrs.
Wainwrighfs countenance was turned from him. The party stopped at a
well, and when he offered her a drink from his cup he thought she ac

of the professor he found him as before, stunned with surprise, and thÂ«
only idea he had was to be as tractable as a child.
When he returned to the head of the column Nora again cantered for
ward to join him. "Well, me gay Lochlnvar," she cried, 'and has your
disposition improved?"
"You are very fresh," he said. . __ _.
She laughed loud enough to be heard the full length of the caravan. It
was a beautiful laugh, but full of insolence and confidence. He flashed his
eyes malignantly upon her. but then she only laughed more, bhe cou s d

He finally laughed. "Confound you, Nora. I would like to kill you
But at his laugh she was all sunshine. It Was as if she had been
trying to taunt him into good humor with her. "Aw, now. Rufus, don t be
angry. I'll be good. Rufus. Really I will. Listen. I want to tell you

Coleman was horrified. "But you are not going toâ you are not going

Bound hand and foot at his stake, he could not even chant his defiant
torture song. It might precipitateâ in fact, he was sure it would Precipitate
the grand smash. But to the very core of his soul he for the time hated
Nora Black. He did not dare to remind her that he would revenge him
self; he dared only to dream of this revenge: but it fairly made his
thoughts flame, and deep in his throat he was swearing an innexime per

As they rode on he deliberated as to the best means of dealing with .this
condition. Suddenly he resolved to go with the whole tale direct to Mar

he loved her and then explainâ explain! He groaned when he came to me

The cavalcade reached at last the bank of the Aracthus River, with its
lemon groves and lush grass. A battery whe-Â»ed before them over the
ancient bridgeâ a flight of short, broad cobbled steps up as far as the cen
ter of the stream and a similar flight down to the other bank. The return
ing aplomb of the travelers was well illustrated by the P rof^ so l' I^n'
upon sighting this bridge, murmured. "Byzantine." This was the first in
dication that he had still within him a power to resume the normal.
The steep and narrow street was crowded with soldiers; the smoky
little coffee shops wore a-babble with people discussing the news from the
front. None seamed to he*"! â¦he remarkable procession that wended its way
to the cable office. Here Coleman resolutely took precedence. He knew V 9
there was no rood In expecting intelligence out of the chaotic clerks but he
mar aged to get upon the wires this message: "Eclipse-, New York: Got
Wainwright party; all well. Coleman." The students had struggled to
Bend messages to their people in America, but they had only succeeded in
deepening the tragic boredom of the clerks.
When Coleman returned to the street he thought that he had seldom
looked upon a more moving spectacle than the Wainwright party presented
at that moment. Most of the student 3 were seated in a row, dejectedly.
upon the curb. The professor and Mrs. Wainwright looked like two old
pictures, which, after an existence in a considerate gloom, had been
brought out in their tawdriness to the clear light. Hot white dust covered
everybody, and from out the grim}' faces the eves blinked, red-fringed
with sleeplessness. Desolation sat upon all save Marjory. She possessed
some marvelous power of looking always fresh. This quality had Indeed im

"That girl would look well anywhere." Nora Black had not been amiable
In her reply.
Coleman called the professor and the dragoman for a durbar. The
drapreman said, "Well, I can get one carriage, and we can go immediate
lee."
"Carriage be blowed!" said Coleman. "What these people need is reit,
sleep. You must find a place at once. These people can't remain in the
street." He spoke in anger, as if he had previously told the dragoman and
the latter had been inattentive. The man immediately departed.
Coleman remarked that there was no course but to remain in the street
until his dragoman had found them a habitation. It was a mournful wait-
Ing. The students sat on the curb. Once they whispered to Coleman,
suggesting a drink, but he told them that he knew only one cafe, the en
trance of which would be in plain sight of the rest of the party. The ladies
talked together in a group of four. Nora Black was bursting with the
fact that her servant had hired rooms in Arta on their outcoming journey,
and she wished Mrs. Walnwright and Marjory to come to them, at least
for a time, but she dared not risk a refusal, and she felt something in Mrs.
Wainwright's manner which led her to be certain that such would be the
answer to her invitation. Coleman and the professor strolled slowly up
and down the walk.
"Well, my work is over, sir." said Coleman. "My paper told me to find
you, and through no virtue of my own I found you. I am very glad of It.
I don't know of anything in my life that has given me greater pleasure."
The professor was himself again in so far as he h.ad lost all manner of
dependence. But still he could not vet be bumptious. "Mr. Coleman." he
said. "I am placed under life-long obligation to you. â¢ â¢ â¢ I am not
thinking of myself so much. â¢ * * My wife and daughterâ His grati
tude was so genuine that he could not finish its expression.
"Oh, don't speak of it," said Coleman. "I really didn't do anything
The dragoman finally returned and led them to a house which he .had
rented for gold. In the great bare upper chamber the students dropped
wearily to- the floor, while the woman of the house took the Wainwrights
to a more secluded apartment. As the door closed on them Coleman turned
like a flash "Have a drink?" he said. The students arose around him
like the wave of a flood. "You bet." In the absence of changes of cloth
ing ordinary food, the possihilltv of a bath, and in the presence of great
weariness and dust Coleman's whisky seemed to them a glistening luxury.
Afterward they laid down as if to sleep, but in reality they were too dirty
and too fagged' to sleep. They simDlr lay murmuring. Peter Tounley evea
developed a small fever.
It was at this time that' Coleman suddenly discovered his acute Inter

had disappeared toward her own rooms. At dusk he went into the street.

thought that this was simply another manifestation <*f Nora a interest in
his movements, and so he turned a corner, and there paused, waiting- uptu
the dragoman spun around directly Into his arms. But it seemed that tnÂ«
man had a note to deliver, and I ttly his Oriental way of doing it.
The note read: "Ceme and tlinr with me to-night." It was not a re
quest. It was peremptory. â¢All right." he said, scowling at the maa.
He did not go at once', for he wished to reflect for a time and find if he
could not evolve some weapons of his ov.n. It seemed to him tnat au me
others were liberally supplied with weapons.
A clear, cold night had come upon the earth when he signified to the
lurking dragoman that he was in readiness to depart with him to >oras
abode. They passed finally Into a dark courtyard, up a winding staircase,
across an embowered balcony, and Coleman entered alone a room where
there were lights.
His feet were scarcely over the threshold before he had concluded that
the tigress was how going to try some velvet purring. He noted that the
arts of the stage had not been thought too cheaply obvious for use. Nora
sat facing the door. A bit of yellow silk had been twisted about the crude
shape of the lamp, and it made the play of light, amberlike, shadowy- anu
yet perfectly clear, the light which women love. She was arrayed in a
puzzling gown of that kind of Grecian silk which is so doc:lr that one can
pull yards of it through a ring. It was the color of new straw. Her chin,
was leaned pensively upon her palm and the light fell or. a pearly roundea
forearm. She was looking at him with a pair of famous eyes, azure, per
hapsâcertainly purple at timesâ and it may be black at odd momentsâ a
pair of eyes that had made many an honest man's heart jump if he thought
they were looking at him. It was a vision, yes. but Ooleman's cynical
knowledge of drama overpowered his sen=e of its beauty. He broke out
brutally in the phrases of the American street. "Your dragoman \a a rub
ber-reck. If he keeps darklng me I will simply have to kick the stuffing
out of him."
She was alone in the room. Her old lady had been instructed to have a
headache and send apologies. She was not disturbed by Coleman's words.
"Sit down, Rufus, and have a cigarette, and don't be cross, because I won t
stand it."
He obeyed her glumly. She had placed hi? chair where not a charm of
her could be lost upon an observant man. Evidently she did not purpose
to allow him to irritate her away from her original plan. Purring was now
her method and none of his Insolence couM achieve a grow! from the
tigress. She arose, savin* softly: "You look tired, almost ill. poor boy.
I will give yn U some brandy. I have almost everything that I could thir.K
to make those Daylight people buy." TViffin a sweep of her hand she indi
cated the astonishing opulence of Ore possessions in different parts or the
room.
As she stood over him with the brandy there came through the smoke
of his cigarette the perfume of orris root and violet.
A servant b*>gan to arrange the little cold dinner on a camp table, and
Coleman saw with an enthusiasm which he could not fully master four
ouart bottles of a notable brand of champagne placed in a rack on the
floor.
At dinner Nora was sisterly. She watched him. waited upon him.
treated him to an affectionate intimacy for which he knew a thousand
men who would have hated him. The champagne was cold.
Slowly he melted. By the time that the boy came with little cups of
Turkish coffee he was at least amiable. Nora talked dreamily. "The
dragoman say? this room used to be part of the harem ions: ago." She
shot him a watchful glance, as if she had expected the fact to affect him.
"Seems curious, doesn't It? A harem. Fancy that." He smoked one cigar
and then discarded tobacco, for the perfume of orris root and violet was
making him meditate.* Nora talked on in a low voice. She knew that
through half-closed lids he was looking at her in steady speculation. She
knew that she was conquering, but no movement of hers betrayed an ela
tion. "With the most exquisite art she aided his contemplation, baring to
him. for Instance, the glories of a statuesque neck, doing it all with tho
manner of a splendid and fabulous virgin who knew not that there was
such a thing as shame. Her stockings were of black silk.
Coleman presently answered her only in monosyllable, making small
distinction between yes and no. He simply sat watching her with eyes in,
which there were two little covetous steel-colored flames.
He was thinking. "To go to the devilâ to go to the devilâ to go to the
devil with this girl was not a ba* fateâ not a bad fateâ a bad fate."
CHAPTER XVIII.
"Come out on the balcony." cooed Nora, "There are some funny old!
storks on top of some chimneys near here and they clatter like mad all
day and nieht."
They moved together out to the balcony, but Nora retreated with a
little cry when she felt the coldness of the night. Sh<* said that she would
get a cloak. Coleman was not unlike a man. in a dream H*Â» walked to
the rail of the balcony, where a great vine climbed toward the roof. He
noted that it was dotted with blossoms, which in the dee of the
Oriental night were colored in strange shadp? of maroftn. This truth pene
trated his abstraction until when Nora -^ame sh<> found him staring- at
them as if their color was a revelation which affceted him vitally. Ph<Â»
moved to his side without sound, and he first knew of her presence from
the damning fragrance. She spoke just above her breath. "It's a beautiful
evening."
"Yes." he answered. She was at his shoulder. If he moved two inches
he must come in contact. They remained in silence leaning upon the rail.
Finally he began to mutter some commonplaces which meant nothing par
ticularly, but into his tone as he mouthed them was the note of a forlorn
and passionate lover. Then as if by accident he traversed the two inches
and his shoulder was against the soft and yet firm shoulder of Nora
Black. There was something in his throat at this time which changed his
voice into a mere choking noise. She did not move. He could see her eyes
flowing innocently out of the pallor which the darkness gave to her face.
f he was touching her she did not seem to knqw it.
"I am awfully tired," said Coleman thickly. "I think I will go home
and turn in."
"You must be. poor boy." said Nora tenderly. '"Wouldn't you like a
little more of that champagne?"
"Well. I don't mind another glass."
She left him again and his galloping thought pounded to the old re
frain. To go to the dexilâ to go to the devilâ to go to the devil with this
girl was not a bad fate â not a bad fate â not a ba<l fate. When she returned
he drank his glass of champagne. Then he mumbled: "You must be cold.
Let me put your, cape around you better. It won't do to catch cold here,
you know."
She made a sweet pretense of rendering herself to his care. "Oh,
thanks â¢ â¢ * I am not really cold â¢ â¢ â¢ There, that's better."
Of course all his manipulation of the cloak had been a fervid caress,
and although her acting up to this point had remained in the role of the.
splendid and fabulous virgin she now turned her liquid eyes to his with a
look that expressed knowledge, triumph and delight. She waa sure of her
victory. And she said. "Sweetheart â¢ â¢ â¢ don't you think I am as nice as
Marjory?" The impulse had been airily confident.
It was as if the silken cords had been parted by the sweep of a sword.
Coleman's face had instantly stiffened and he looked like a man suddenly
recalled to the ways of light. It may easily have been that in a moment
he would have lapsed again to his luxurious dreajning. But in his face,
the girl had rÂ«=ad a fatal character to her blunder and her resentment
against him took precedence of any other emotion. She wheeled abruptly
from him and said with great contempt: "Rufus. you had better go home.
You're tired and sleepy and more or less drunk." Â»
He knew that the grand tumble of all their little embowered incident
could be n-Mfh<--r stayed nor mended. "Tea," he answered sulkily, "I thinV
so, too." They shook hands huffily and he went away.
When he arrived among the students he found that they had appropri
ated everything o{ bis which would conduce to their comfort. He waa
furious over it. But to his bitter speeches they replied in jibes.
"Rufus is himself again. Admire his angelic disposition. See hrm
â mile. Gentle soul."
A "teepy voice said from a corner, "T know what pinches him."
"What?" asked several.
"He's b<=f>n to Bee N 7 'Â«r:\ and she flung' him out bodily."
"Yes.'' sneered Coleman. "At times I seem to spe in you. Coke, thÂ«
fermentation of some primeval form of sensation as if it were possible
for you to develop a mind in two or three thousand years and then at
other times you appear â¢ â¢ â¢ mucL as you are now."
As soon as they had well measurr-d Cplenuuj'a temper all of the stu
dents save Coke kept their mouths tightly closed. Coke either did not un
derstand or his mood was too vindictive for silence. "Well, I know you
get a throw-down all right." he muttered.
"And how would you know when I got a throw-down? You pimply
milk-fed sophomore."
The others perked up their ears in mirthful appreciation of this lan
guage.
"Of course." continued Coleman. "no one would protest against your
continued existence. Coke, unless you insist on recalling yourself violently
to people's attention in this way. The more fact of your living would not
usually be offensive to people If you weren't eternally turning a Bort of
calcium light on your prehensile attributes."
Coke wa? suddenly angry, angry much like a peasant, and his anger
first evinced itself in a mere sputtering and spluttering. Finany he got out
a rather long speech, full of grumbling noises, but he was understood by
all to declare that his prehensile attributes had not led him to cart a noto
rious woman about the world with him. When they quickly looked at
Coleman they saw that he was livid. "Youâ"
But of course there immediately arose all sorts of protesting cries from
the seven non-combatants. Coleman. as he took twi strides toward Coke's
corner, looked fully able to break him across his knee, but for this Coke did
not seem to care at all. Pie was on his feet with a challenge in his eye.
Upon each cheek burned a sudden hectic spot. The others were clamoring.
"Oh say this won't do. Quit it. Oh. we mustn't have a fight. He didn t
mean it, Coleman." Peter Tounley pressed Coke to the wall, saying, â¢'You
d young jackass, be quiet."
They were in the midst of these festivities when a door opened and
disclosed the professor. He might have been coming into the middle of a
row in one of the corridors of the college at home, only this time he car
ried a candle. His speech, however, was a Washurst speech. "Gentle-
Tnen gentlemen what does this mean?" All seemed to expect Coleman to
make the answer. He was suddenly very cool. "Nothing, professor' ha
eaid "only that thisâ only that Coke has insulted me. I suppose that it
was 'only the irresponsibility of a boy, and I beg that you will not trouble
over it."
"Mr. Coke," said the professor indignantly, "what have you to say to
this?" Evidently he could not clearly see Coke, and he peered around his
candle at where the virtuous Peter Tounley was expostulating with the
young man. The figures of all the excited group moving in the candle
light, caused vast and uncouth shadows to have Titanic conflicts in the end
of the room.
Peter Tounley's task waa not light, and beyond that he had the con
viction that his struggle with Coke was making him also to appear as a
rowdy. This conviction was proved to be true by a sudden thunder from
the old professor. 'Mr. Tounley, desist:"
In wrath he desisted and Coke flung himself forward. He paid less at
tention to the professor than if ih* latter had been a jack rabbit. "You
say I insulted you?" he shouted crazily in Coleman's face. "Well â¢ â¢ â¢
I meant to, do'you see?"
Coleman was gl.icial and lofty beyond everything. "I am glad to have
you admit the truth of what I have said."
Coke was still suffocating with his peasant ruse, which would not
allow him to meet the clear, calm expressions of Coleman. "Yes â¢ â¢ â¢
I Insulted you â¢ â¢ â¢ I insulted you because whr,t I said was correct
â¢ â¢ * my prehensile attributes â¢ â¢ â¢ yea â¢ â¢ â¢ but I have neverâ"
He was interrupted by a chorus from the other students. "Oh, no, that
won't do. Don't say that. Don't repeat that. Coke."
Coleman remembered the weak bewilderment of the litt!Â» professor !n
hours that had not long passed, and it was with something of an imper
sonal satisfaction that he said to himself, "The old boy's got his war
paint on again." The professor had stepped sharply up to Coke and looked
at him with eyes that seemed to throw out flame ar.rl heat. There was a
moment's pause, and then the old scholar spoke, biting his words as If
they were each a short section of steel wire. "Mr. Coke, your behavior
will end your college career abruptly and in gloom, I promise you. You
have been drinking "
Coke, his head simply floating in a sea of universal defiance at one*
blurted out. Tea, Mr."
"You have been drinking?" cried the professor ferociously. "Retire to
yourâ retire to yourâ retireâ " And then In a voice of thunder he shouted
"Retire."
Whereupon *even hoodlum students waited a decent moment, then
shrieked with laughter. But the old professor would have none of their
nonsense. He quelled them all with force and finish.
Coleman now spoke a few words. "Professor, I can't tell you how
sorry I am that I should he concerned in any such riot as this, and since
we are doomed to be bound so closely into each other's society I offer my
self without reservation as being willing to repair the damage as well as
may be don.:. 1 don't see how I can forget at once that Coke's conduct
was insolently unwarranted, but â¢ â¦ â¢ if he has anything to say â¢ â¢ â¢
of a nature that might heal the breach â¢ * â¢ I would be willing to â¢ â¢ â¢
to iesÂ«t him In th-? openest manner." As he made these remarks Cole
man's dignity was something grand, and. moreover, there was now upon
his face that curious look of temperance and purity which had been noted
in Xew York as a singular physical characteristic. If he was guilty of
anything in this affair at allâ in fact, if he had ever at any time been,
guilty of anythingâ no mark had come to stain that bloom of innocence
The professor nodded in the fullest appreciation and sympathy. "Of course
â¢ â¢ â¢ really there is no other sleeping place * â¢ â¢ I suppose it would
be betterâ" Then he again attacked Coke. "Young man, you have chosen
an unfortunate moment to fill us with a suspicion that you may not be a
gentleman. For the time there is nothing to be done with you." He ad
dressed the other students. "There Is nothing for me to do. young gentle
men, but to leave Mr. Coke In your care. Good-night, sirs. Good-night,
Coleman." He left the room with his candle.

RROM the standpoint of absolute
purity, broad disinterestedness,
high motive ami general interest
no other sport or sporting event
J^ can even compare with the Inter*
national yacht races scheduled for
October 3, v. 7, 9 and 11 outside the harbor
of New York. These races pr( sent Ideas
that must appeal even to the most sloth
ful citizen. They mean almost as much
to '.!:â¢â  man who has never seen, a sailboat
as to the enthusiast who talks yachting
all winter and ilia all summer.
With these races it is not simply a tost
of skill and speed between two different
sized yachts. It Is a battle of the world
against America. Every man woo loves
his country's supremacy will watch thÂ«
contest with the keenest interest, for th.
success or failure of the yacht Columbia
will mean the success or failure of Amer
ican skill over the skill of the world. The
Shamrock, the challenging yacht, comes
not alone as the representative of Great
Britain and Ireland. The trophy she sails
for, the America's cup. is open to the
competition of the whole world. The
German, Russian, French, Dutch and
other yachtsmen arc about as keenly con
cerned in the outer me as are the British,
Evidence of this is furnished by the news
cabled recently from the other side to the
effect that Emperor William of Germany
has detailed the skipper of his racing
yacht! the Meteor, to aid the skipper of
the Shamrock on the occasion of the in
ternational races.
Almost as strong an attraction as the
patriotism that the yacht races embody is
the fact that in these contests there is ab
solutely no taint of commercialism. There
is no idea of gain, no gambling.
The races will cost the promoters over
half a million dollars. For this enormous
outlay thnre is absolutely no return except
the satisfaction of promoting the general
sport. It is all outlay and no Income.
There is no "gate," no purse, no "side
bet," no anything. It is just sport for
sport's sake. On the American side the
cost of the contest is borne principally by
J. Plerpont Morgan, the great banker, and
the commodore of the New York Yacht
Club. Associated with him are C. Oliver
Iselin and William Butler Duncan. Mr.
Iselin is a mcraber of a millionaire family,
and has spent hundreds of thousands of
dollars for yachting. He ranks as the
managing owner of the Columbia, and has
lull charge of her operations. Mr. Duncan
inherited his fortune from the estate of A.
T. Stewart, and haa spent his income lav
ishly in the pursuit of yacht racing hon
ors. He Is the managing owner of the De
fender, which defended the International
cup against the Valkyrie 111. The De
fender has been modernized and fitted to
serve as a pacemaker in the preliminary
trial races arranged to test the Columbia's
speed.
']'â ; remodel the Defender, put her in
commission and handle her will cost Mr.
Morgan and Mr. Duncan and the other
gentlemen who are interested in the ven
ture something in the neighborhood of
$50,000, a pretty fair item tor a "trial
boat." As a matter of fact, the Defender
is almost as fast as the !olumb.a herself,
and. according to the record made on the'
other side by the Shamrock, the pace
maker might safely be rusted in l-.o d the
cup on her own account.
The. cost of the Columbia and her main
tenance until after the. last race has been
sailed will, in rour.ti numbers, be about
$150,000, according i.i experts on thÂ«
subject. To begin with; the boat
cost to build about ,000.
She carries a crew of <^Â«*
thirty men, all
Wch-prlced,
picked experts, from the captain down.
These men must be quartered outside of
the vessel herself, for, like all racers, the
Columbia baa absolutely no accomm ;
tlons below deck. Sin Is simply a huge
shell 130 feet long and about IS feet I >â¢;>.
Standing on the platform which serves for
her deck, one can Bee through the hatch
way right down to her bottom. Inside
there Is nothing except n series of steel
girders and braces. "When the races are
over, and If her owners choose, the Co
lumbia may be fitted up with cabins. But
oven if this la the case all such cabin
work, flooring, etc., would be ripped out
again as soon ns she was ready to enter
another race.
Unable to find room on the yacht, her
crew are therefore quartered lard a
steam tender which accompanies the Co
lumbia wherever she goes. To maintain
this tender and to feed the crew alone
costs somewhere In the neighborhood of
$25,000. The Defender is likewise equipped
with a tender for her crew, the cost of
which is little less than that of the Co
lumbia herself. All these items must be
Included in making up the cost of the
race. After the race has beet sailed the
Columbia, if .thrown on the market, would
probably not fetch over $10,000 or $15,000,
as she is practically worthless for cruising
a â  she la practically wi rthless f r cruising
purposes, having been designed entirely
for speed, all idea of comfort being sacri
ficed. Some of the other Items of expense
connected with the American side of the
race will be the cost of maintaining a fleet
of tugs to patrol the course, to serve as
stakeboals, etc. This will foot up well In
the thousands, as the demand for tugs
and all other craft will be enormous.
On the British side the cost will be even
greater, if anything, than it Is on the
American. Sir Thomas Dipton. who built
the Shamrock, must do all that Mr. Mor
gan and his associates have done, besides
standing the expense of sending the chal
lenger across under her own sail.
Some idea of the cost of fitting up the
racers may be obtained from the fact that
one suit of sails cost in the neighborhood
of $2000. These sails axe specially woven
from Egyptian and Sea island cotton,
mixed with silk. They cost SI a yard. In
addition the yachts carry a spinnaker and
other light sails of pure silk which cost
all the way from $2 to $4 per yard.
Measured by the amount of money that
has been spent in the contests for the
America's cup, it Is without exception the
most valuable thing In the world. The
crown of the Czar of Russia, the richest
ornament on earth, with Its marvelous
diamonds and rubies and other priceless
gems, becomes almost a bauble in compar
ison with this battered old silver cup. The
trophy has been fought for ten times: in
1851, 70, 71, 76. 'SI, '86, '86, 'S7, '93 and '95.
In the past, while the cost of preparation
and the money spent for all Its Items has
not been as great as will be the case this
year, the average cost for the ten races^
will easily foot up $500,000 for each, arjtf
total of $5,000,000.
The toi.il sail spread of the Qjifl
lumbia is about 14,000 square f'-e^fl

S
part of a city block, or about a third of an
acre. It la because of this mass of canvas
that such a large crew Is required on the
yachts. No one without experience can ap
preciate the tremendous task of handling
surely and rapidly a Bail spread such as
the Columbia carries.
An ordinary commercial vessel of three
times The Columbia's size would carry Just
about half her sail spread. To carry
more would bo unprofitable and unsafe
from a business standpoint. A 400-ton
schooner cannot afford to carry over five
or six men and make money. Then, too.
It Is out of the question for any vessel to
carry a spread of sail such as the Colum
bia's except in smooth water and In a
comparatively light wind, a gale corning
upon the Columbia with all sails spread
would strip her clean In a second. Even
with her large crew she could not escape
complete loss It she was suddenly over
taken by a high wind.
The power of such a vessel as the ''<>-
lumbia when she has all her canvas set is
enormous. Her speed as tested in her re
cent trials against the Defender Is about
13 knots an hour. To drive a vessel her
.-:/.â¢ at a similar speed under steam would
require about 300 horsepower. In other
words, 200 horses would be required to do
the work that the sails of the Columbia
do when she is going with the wind. An
engine to drive her at the same speed
would consume about' 7so pounds of coal
per hour. This would be a "long ton" for
three hours' sailing maximum speed, or
eight tons per day of twenty-four hours.
Allowing twelve days for crossing, the
sails of a vessel such us the Columbia
would have given power- equivalent to
about 100 tons of coal.
There are many other interesting feat
ures about these races. Not the least In
teresting is the fact that with all the vast
sums of money spent on perfecting and
fitting them out, there are any number of
boats in New York and elsewhere that
could easily distance them in. a straight
away race before the wind. Both the
Columbia and the Shamrock draw J
about 18 feet of water. This deep /
draught creates a proportionate / J

wind. It Is when sailing against the wind
that such vessels as the Columbia become
fliers as compared with the others. It is
then that their lines count, and it Is for
this that the designers and builders have
spent years and years In experimenting,
and the owners have spent millions of
money In building. It is for work of this
class that the vessels are made to draw
so much â¢ water. Sailing against
the wind, or "lacking," involves a pe
culiar principle of mechanics. Here
the wind is pushing- one way. and In
order to overcome this force and to
prevent the vessel from being driven i

surface must be presented under- /

you ask him if he would not like to help

tell you, "and every one of us fell in love
with her the minute we stepped on the
deck. It took a dozen men to handle her.
not counting Captain Brown, our skipper,
and two mates. We were picked from
many a locker, but every man knew how
to sail a boat. Most of us had been to
sea and the others were old hands at
navigating the pilot boats about New
York harbor. Captain Brown himself had
this berth for many years, and he could
sail a yacht with any of these later
cracks. He was a good Yankee, and it
was due to his influence that we hung
together so well. He told us the boat
was built for a syndicate headed by Com
modore Stevens of the New York Yacht
Club, who was a dead game sport, by the
way ' He came on board several times
with George T. Schuyler and Mr.
Steers the builder, and looked us over
vprv carefully. 'Boys, we can clean up
anything that floats. 1 he said and or
dered us some superior rum. This was
after we had beaten a number of sloops
in trial races down the bay, and word

X we seldom used topsails, for there
was enough breeze to keep us go-

struck heavy weather twice we
never felt in danger.
"On putting In at Cowes we
were boarded by nearly cv-
cry small boat in the har-
harbor. Captain Brown
had called us all aft
before making port
and cautioned us
against talking.
'You needn't
Bay anything

Mr. Stevens had offer d to sal anything in
England, and there would be h race. Not
a day passed that me deck did not swarm
with visitors, and part of the crew were
told off to see that they did not pry too
much. In fact, they kept so close that we
lost the first races we were in."
This is a feature of the narrative that
Captain Hoffman cannot be persuaded to
dwell on. '"You know," he said, with a wise
blink of the eye. "that sometimes you
want to pitch a stove overboard when you
are getting a yacht into sailing trim, and
it is rot convenient to have spectators
about. Well, when the day came for the
cup race we had -that boat cleaned from
stem to stern. We did this before the
English recruits came on board. Those
chaps never forgot that race, I'll bet.
You see. twelve men were not enough to
handle the beat in a race and the skip
per had six go ashore and hire six Brit
ishers, who were turned over for us to
watch.
"We didn't like the looks of them very
much and they didn't stem to fancy us.
â¢We're going to have trouble with these
John Bulls,' reported a big quartermaster
named Connors. 'Not if you know your
business,' replied the captain. One of the
crew suggested that the Englishmen be
divided up so that not more than two
would be together at one station, and this,
was done. They were thus surrounded
and under such vigilance that they could
not do anything crooked.
"The morning of August 22 broke with a
clear sky and soft breeze from -the west,
and before 10 o'clock fifteen boats of all
lengths and sizes had gathered about us.
As the Aurora went by maneuvering her
crew were hoisting the mainsail. When
they got abeam a little cockney started
up "the old song, "A Yankee Ship Sailed
Down the Bay,' and the rest of the crew
came In on the chorus. 'Pull, boys, bully
boys. pull.' 'You'd better save that sheet
for a tow,' called one of our men. but the
Aurora had passed and did not hear it.
" 'I fancy it's us'll need the tow,' said
one .of our English recruits.
" 'Let me give you some advice," said
the second mate, who overheard the re
mark. 'Don't let the skipper hear you
say that.'
â¢'When the signal was given the breeze
blew very light, and some of the English
beats forged ahead, among them the Au
rora. We crowded on every inch of can
vas, and not a man of us who did not pray
for it to freshen. Word was passed quietly
to see that the Englishmen did not shirk.
Captain Brown stood by the English pilot,
for him also we had to take on, as the
course around the Isle of Wight was
new to us, and we had to rely entirely
on the pilot's guidance. Captain Brown
watched him liKe a hawk, but I want
to say that he acted on the square

'"This was taken up and passed along
until the English sailors heard it, and
asked if it was true. They would not
be convinced otherwise, and after the
race spread this report ashore. Then we
were boarded by greater crowds than
ever, and were not cleared of the charge
really until the America was put into dry
dock. No one could understand how the
Aurora was beaten so badly without
some device such as this. She finished
about half an hour behind us, and this
time would have been tripled had not a
strong breeze come up after we had
crossed the line."
Across the street from the Herreshoff
shipyards in Bristol, where the Defender
and the Columbia were built, there stands
an old country house with a generous
New England "stoop." In front of it
there is a row of magnificent trees, and it
looks cut upon the Bay of Bristol. Some
times in pleasant weather a little old
woman in black comes out and sits for a
while with one of her daughters and
watches tile stately yachts come up the
harbor from Newport and Fall River. She
Is the mother of all the Herreshoffs. Last
February she celebrated her eighty-ninth
birthday, and she was yet hale enough to
take pride in the Columbia as she was
building in the shops. She is a descend
ant of the famous family of Lewises of
Boston, merchants and shipmen, and
she brings to the present branch
of the family much of its
skill as ship designers and builders.
Her husband, Charles Frederick Herres
heff. died thirteen years ago. leaving a
family of seven sons and two daughters,
two of whomâ James B. and Nat G.â are
the organizers of the famous shipbuilding
company. Never was there a family more
positively touched with genius. John B.
Herreshoff. the president of the company,
who has been blind now for more than
forty years, developed in his early boy
hood a genius for invention. Some of the
older residents of Bristol tell to-day about
the wonderful Herreshoff churn, which
converted the milk on the Herreshoff
farm at Providence Island into butter.
It was the invention of John B. "Captain
Nat," as he is called in Bristol, built boats
from the time he was a mere boy. At
one time he constructed a catamaran with
which he cruised up and down the
harbor. It was an odd-looking, wide
craft, with abnormally large sails, and
when it first appeared he was the butt
of much good-natured raillery. Forth
with he began to issue challenges to race,
and much to the astonishment of every
body, he won all the races. And finally,
to show what he could do, he sailed down
the harbor from Newport, watched for
one of the big sound steamers bound up
from New York and veering into line beat
the steamer into Providence.
Another of the blind Herreshoffs, Lewis,
is an expert swimmer, as well as some
thing of a literary man. I saw him not
many days ago wading out into the bay
with a flock of little girls. Two of them
held to his shoulders and he swam out to
a float anchored twenty yards away, and
there .he taught them to dive. Still an
ot.ier of the blind brothers has become an
accomplished musician and gives lessons
Providence. Two others are experi-
chemists: one lives on the

YOM KIPPUR-ITS SIGNIFICATION TO THE JEWS.
1 V OM KIPPUTt (Tom, the day; K3j>
/ I pur, pardon), or Day of Atone-
I I ment. will be observed on the 10th
V-O day of Tishri. which corresponds
C^i to the 15th day of September In
the standard calendar, by Jews all over
the world with but few exceptions.
Torn Kippur Is the only fast day or
dained by Moses, and was originally
meant, perhaps, as a temporary day of
expiation for the sin of the worship of the
golden calf, yet It was permanently in
stituted by Moses as a day of atonement
for sin In general.
The later Jews, however. Instituted a
few more fast days in commemoration of
tome disastrous events, â¢specially, which
occurred at and after the time
of Hie destruction of the two
temp.. but these additional fast
days have now become almost obso
lete. The one ordained by Moses Is still
as generally observed as It was at any
time In the history of the ancient JewÂ»,
but the ceremonies connected with the
day have been considerably modified.
The ceremonies observed by the ancient
Jews on this great fast day were legion.
Tlie high priest had to prepare himself
In nearly solitary confinement for the ar
duous duties that awaited him and to
avoid all that could disturb his devotions
or render him unclean. The most re
markable ceremony of. thÂ« day was the
entrance of the high priest Into the sanc
tuary where the ark containing the tables
of the law, or the Ten Commandments,
was kept, a thing not allowed on any
other clay of the year.
The high priest entered the sanctuary
fov.r different times. The first time he
was provided with the polrten censer and
a vessel filled with Incense. The vessel
was placed between the two poles of the
tabernacle and the Incense upon the coals.
This done, ho went out backward, so as
not to turn" his back upon the sanctuary.
At b! srcoril entrance he took with him
the blood of a bullock; which he had
sacrificed In expiation of his own sins
and 'hose cf the other priests, placed
himself between the poles of the taber
nacle, dipped his linger In the blood and
Bprinkled it seven times below and once
above â¢â :â¢â  seat, or cover of the
ark, on which were placed the cherubim.
The third time he entered with the
blood of a ram, which he had offered for
the sins of the nation: With this he
eprir.::led the veil of the tabernacle eight
time:;, aud having mixed It with the blood
of the bollock he sprinkled :t toward the
bras arid gold covered wooden horns of
the altar ol incense even times and once
above it; toward the east, after which he
poured out. the whole on the floor of the
altai of burnt offerings and again left the
sanctuary; takirfg with him the basins
which had contained the blood. The

den:. 1 s. of later-day culture. The mag
nificent if somewhat barbaric display of
the olden temple la but a tradition in Is
rael to-day. In modern times the day has
bee.::; , to quote Philo, an occasion for
the discipline of self-restraint In regard to
material indulgence, and for bringing
home to the popular mind the truth of the
Bible verse â that man lives not by bread
alone, but by what God is pleased to ap
point. On this day the Jew prays that his
Bins against virtue and conscience may be
forgiven and promises to amend his life
for the future. While, however, he be
lieves that God will pardon the repentant
sinner, he Is conscious that the sense of
being forgiven can only be his after he
has atoned for the wrongs committed
against his neighbor by making full
reparation.
In olden times the Day of Atonement
â¢was an even more solemn occasion, viewed
from a social standpoint. On that day all
dividing lines were obliterated. All men
Were free. No slave owed allegiance to
any earthly master. At sunset, when the
trumpet announced the end of the fast,
the slave who had served his six years
â was free to return to his home. Every
seventh year "the year of release" was
proclaimed at the expiration of. the day of
atonement. This year of release corre
sponds to the statute of limitation, with
this difference, however, that .the release
â¢was for all debts contracted at any time
during the previous seven years. This
was subsequently altered making the
period during which debts were collect
ible seven years from the date at trans
action. The jubilee was proclaimed on
the day of atonement, from which day It
dated.
After the announcement of the Jubilee
all slaves returned to the i?n.ioymei;t
of their civil and' political rights and all
real estate reverted to its original owner.
From the foregoing fact one can easily
Imagine how anxiously the ancient Jew
awaited the advent of the great dayâ that
day that would not only see him free
from sin but liberated from the thrall of
bondage. In ten days in every year there
â¢wore no slaves. From the first day of the
Beventh month till darknoss ended the
tenth day no slave was expected to serve
his master. Reunited with his family for
that period, he was expected, like his
master, as the father and husband, to set
his own house In order and purify his

BLUNT simplicity nnd quaJnt
straight forwardness of dialogue
and description are qualities that
force themselves upon the reader's
notice in ;he eariiest pages o* "Defender
of the Faith," and tenaciously cling to the
romance to the end. Not a superfluous
â word Is used. This Inevitableness and
uniformity of key are quite delightful, and
their charm and Influence linger long after
the book is closed. The tale is historicalâ
a somewhat personal and domestic narra
tive of the life of Henry the Eighth as
known to Henry Percy, sixth Karl of Nor
thumberland, "who was Wolsey'a pupil,
Anr.e Bullen's lover and the King's
friend." Frank Mathew, who will be re
membered as the author of "A Child In
the Temple," "At the Rising of the
Moon." etc.. has gone directly to histori
cal sources for authority in drawing hie
characters, and thus the romance carries
other than flctlonaJ weight Cavendlsh'i
"Life of Wolsey" and Kingston's â¢'Memo
rial" are referred to for dialogue. Uha
puys the "State Papers," the "Baga de
Secretes," Strype. Godwin, Constantyne
and the "Cabala" are the other authori
ties quoted. The intimate life of Henry is
pictured from the fall of Woolsey, through
the ascendancy of Cromwell, the disfavor
and execution of Anne, the marriage with
Jane Seymour, the rising of the Pilgrims
of Grace and Lhe entrance upon the scene
of Katherine Howard. The scenes arc
not historical, for Aske is present when
Northumberland arrests Wolsey, Nor
thumberland lives on after the rising of
the Pilgrims of Grace and the King ia
present at the council on the day of Crom
well's arrest. The romance is in three
partsâ "The Fall of the Cross," descrip
tive- of Wolsey's fall; "The Queen of
May," devoted to Anne's brief reign, and
"Pflgrims of Grace," the revolt of the
Catholics. Henry is frankly pictured in
all phases of his strength and weakness
ajid without varnish in all his moral hid
eousness. At one part in the narrative he
is thus described:
"Then the King camÂ«, riding alone. He
wore yellow silk and a short mantle of er
mine, and a round cap of crimson velvet
with a flaunting white plume. As he
loung'-'l. managing a white horse hung
with trappings of clrtth-of-gold, he was
nodding with a lazy good humor. On his
big horse he towered above the worship
ing people. Though he was still glowing
and fortunate, there was a lurking un
easiness in his masterful eyes." Some of
the King's dialogue with Anne reveal his
character and condition. For Instance:
"Vuur eyes are wet, baby," he went on,
as he pulled her to his knee. "You have
been crying again."
"I have been sleepless.
"Why?"
"Thinking of you."
"How could you be better employed?"
he said, fondling her neck. "I'll forgive
thatâ but no tears, mind you. I chose you
as a companion in happiness. While I

the censer and vessel of Incense.
Another of the peculiar sacrifices of the
day was the selection of two g-oats, both
to be alike In stature, color and age, ono
of which waa to be sacrificed to Jehovah
and the other to be sent to the desert
burdened with the sins of the people and
set at liberty. Lots were drawn to de
termine which of the goats should be
killed. The scapegoat was called Azazel,
meaning removed or sent-off goat.
The remainder of the day was Bpent In
prayers and other works of penance.
Among the present orthodox Jews, for
the scapegoat of old, chickens are sub
stituted, which they call Chapora. Roost
ers are used for the male member* of the
horsetxold and hern for thÂ« female mÂ«a
own soul and conscience that he might
morally stand the equal of any before his
God.

"You choke me," she gasped. Still he
throttled her. Then he flung her off.
Poor little Anne, in spite of her often
and evident hypocrisy and. sophistication,
wins our sympathies, and the King and
Cromwell become hateful people.
The writer's opinion of Cromwell Is not
an elevated one, for he takes sides against
Froude and others in believing him thor
oughly dishonest in his proression3 of
piety. He says that, on good authority,
it Is known that he had been fervent in
his profession of Roman Catholicism when
that was convenient. However, Borne of
the most Interesting passages in the book
are made so by words of his. Of much
that Is quotable the following is selected:
"We thirst for wine, and the gods lavish
it upon us as soon as the years have
soured it to vinegar."
"All gayety is innocent, as flame must
be pure, though it rises from burning
filth." .
"The ' muddy gardener digs while the
lovers gather the roses. Seeds are planted
In graves. Weeding England, I have not
spared crowned thistles."
"When a man is feeble, his mould Is
effeminate and his stains are enduring."
"Sunset sees rosy windows."
"A guttering candle is still deadly to
moths." â¢
"Worshipers kneel to themselves. Yet
the vulgar need threats of damnation.
For their sakes I assume convenient re
ligions."
Northumberland, referring to his tute
lage with Machiavelll, says to Crom
well:
"You an Englishman? Soaked in Ital
ian venom!"
One of the most interesting chapters in
the romance is a pastoral, when North
umberland is cared for by a shepherd,
who travels from time to time to the town
and brings back the news of strife and
slaughter, but telling it so simply that
we are given the history and spared the
horror. "The old man recited these
things merrily, contrasting the folly of
great persons and the wisdom of sheep."
The volume is illustrated with three
portraits after Holbein, Henry VIII,
Cromwell and Anne Bullen.

THE STORY OF ERIE.
That there is much of interest and gen
eral importance In the details of the con
ception and building of a railroad will
be proven to any one who reads Edward
Harold Mott's "Story of Erie." There is
more than local Interest in Erie, for It
was projected over seventy years ago,
when railroads were so little known that
but three States boasted such means of
transportation. There, is many an inci
dent in the record of Erie, startling and
dramatic enough to be of interest in fic
tion, and the book will appeal to all
classes' of readers, not merely as the his
tory of a railroad, but as a history of so
cial, financial and commercial struggle
and progress. The work covers the his
tory of Erie from 1779 to 1890, and is, aside
from its human interest, a very valuable
statistical reference book.

River at a point where the course
of the stream is northeasterly. The
river bank is a bold bluff 75 to 200
feet high and here commands vast views
of the Amur, the green, brushy lowlands
to the north, east and west, the intersect

staring brick buildings, one, two and three
stories high and neat and even pretty one

has its thriving window-garden of be

IF there Is a day in the life of
Israel's religion more important
than others it is the Day of Atone
ment. It conveys to our minds
first, the proneness of man â his
weakness and the loving kindness of
God, who in nis magnanimity has ap
pointed a day whereon to pardon his
children their follies and foibles.
Then again it suggests that man la
the highest object of creation; the very
image of God, and that he can put him
self in communion with his Creator
whenever he becomes conscious of his
guilt.
The most unworthy can go to this
merciful guardian when he becomes
sincere and earnest without having
as an object a person for his atonement.
God is our father and we are his chil
dren, and just as a father pitieth his
child, so will Gi^d have compassion
upon us when we are sincere and con
trite.
The greatest difficulty in presenting
ourselves before the throne of g^-ace is
the thought that we can commit wrong
after wrong and expect the Day of
Atonement to wash us clean from the
scarlet of our sins. Our sages have told
us that "sins committed against God
the Day of Atonement will pardon, but
sins committed against our neighbor
the Day of Atonement will not pardon
until reparation has been made to tha
injured party." That is divine justice.
God Is as kind and as merciful to one
as he is to the other, and in order to
enjoy the real spiritual atonement we
must plead in deeds as well as in words.
To be cleansed from all our sins we
must not only profess repentance, but
we must be really repentant. Tha
Day of Atonement is intended to recon
cile man to man and man to God. It
is the greatest day in the spiritual life
of any faith, and its conferring upon
man the dignity of making him per
sonally competent to come before God
as a mediator confers divine power
upon each individual. No mediator be
tween God and man is the spiritual
meaning of the Day of Atonement.

park the evening of our arrival at hear
ing our own Sousas "Washington Post"
cutting the soft air. We smiled as we saw
the Russian promenaders unconsciously
fall into step as we all do at home. A
short distance from the square brick
house of the Governor, over which floats
the royal standard of black and gold and
at whose door, day and night, stand two

1891 in honor of the visiting Czarewitch.
At one end of the park is a brick museum
filled with costumes, armor, implements
of war and peace, and other things Rus
sian and Chinese.
The great attraction for us was the
bronze statue of General Graf Mooravieff
standing on the point of a lofty promon
tory overlooking the river which he prac
tically opened to Russian trade. Nature
and art have contributed to the impres
sive prominence of the ligure and as its
fine outlines are silhouetted against tha
sky your admiration extends from the
statue to the idea that placed it in such
a noble position. A fence of heavy double
chains, posted with cannon, incloses a
mound twelve feet high, which is reached
by broad granite steps. On the mound is
a granite shaft forty feet high on which
stands the statue. The figure is twenty
feet tall and shows the general in his
prime. The pose is easy, graceful and
strong and the face handsome, intellect
ual and resolute. The arms are folded,
in the right hand a field glass and in tha
left a scroll. From the sword belt hangs
a cross.

He is a lineal descendent of the famous
"Don't-Give-Up-the-Ship" Lawrence and
from his mother's side of the house in

Robert E. Lee.
Lieutenant Lawrence Is the happiest of

Bui he had said that just thirty times

Little Arthur Pohlmann is back from

the adulation which is sur< to be his, by

What manner of man can resist the so

Let me tell you:
I found the street bordered by Company

turned on his heel to a tent near by,
whisked the flapping canvas aside, and
' out in a iamlliar tone. "Sho, a lady

A minute later Lieutenant Lawrence,
tall, d ad with a courtly bearing
that west Point training never fails to
give, invited me to enter.
"We have rather narrow quarters," he
began. Then borne one at the door inter
rupted. "May 1 see y-u a moment?"
A whispered conversation â¢ utside. "Cer
t.iin'iv." responded Lieutenant Lawrence â
a jingling of moneyâ "don't mention it."
Then he resumed conversatl m by re
rrg my question. "How did I feel
when told of my windfall? Quite natur
ally I was elated. Bui strange to cay I
: of it by prophecy three we*ks be
in a most singular way. As you
know, there are In the army a great many
strange personalities. Well, one day after
we fellows were resting under the
â â  of a tree when one of the boj I
jumped up quickly, stood in front of mo
and said:
" 'Gee whiz, Lawrence, I'd like to be In
your boots. Whew' but won't you put
on dog when you gÂ»t all those shiners'."
"I laughed at him ar.d ask^d him to ex
plain, and he at once replied:
" 'In a few weeka you will hear that you
have fallen heir to a fortune.'
"Of course I thoupht the fellow a little
queer, and at thÂ» same tfme there was
just a "little reason in what he said, tor
the estate which has since come into my
jÂ» -session was a 'parent' granted In 1770,
and like all property of that nature,
seemed like the rainbow's pot of gold.
"Well, when th<Â± news came General Otis
telegraphed up to the barracks for me
to come down to headquarters, and I with
my head and heart all full of the idea of
promotion started for the commander's
quarters. You can imagine my surprise
when told that not promotion but a for
tune awaited me upon my return to the
T'nited States. I then had to go down to
make affidavit that I was the person iden
tified iri the deed, and this I did without
hesitation."
"Sho " called a voice from the street.
"Just a minute, please." and the quarto
mlHionaire again left me to hold conver
satton with a private outside.
Again the money Jingled In his purse,
then as he entered I quoted the open se

"Lieutenant Lawrence, just a moment,
please."
At this he laughed and said with feaj-
praled them all in his unconscious hero
ism.
Tell me how you managed it? I said,
looking into a pair of fearless blue eye^
the color for dauntless courage.
"To get aboard was easy enough â but
to stay 'get,' that was the hardest rub.
I tried mighty hard to go away on the
transport Ohio â but â now â I'm glad I
didn't, berause-^two other kids who
went on that transport were captured
by the Filipinos. You see they got tired
marching and fell behind the soldiers
and were never heard from afterward.
But It wasn't my fault that I failed to
go on the Ohio. Why, I waited hours
and hours to get a chance to climb
over the gates of the Folson strait
wharfâ and then when the men were
not looking I climbed over and man
aged to squeeze into an open porthole
and dropped into a bunk to hide.
Ing, "I am glad to oblige themâ they are
nv-n of honor. ev< ry one i t them. I
never think of requiring notes; it is not
necessary."
"Rut why <1o they rail you 'Shn'?"
"That is "only the abbreviation of my
nam<- if takes too long for
them to pronounce it in full and I don't
rnir.d."
There ts such modesty in this man of
new found millions, such consideration
for others that it was a delight to see,
and then I ventured :
"Tell me how Horatio kept the bridge?"
"Oh. no; excuse me; that is just one
et I will not talk upon. It would
not be <iuite the thing for me to say any
thing about that: I Just tried to do my
duty, that is all."
"But did you never feol a premonition
of deathâ or that sort of thing, you
know?"
"Never; but I will say that many times
I have heard soldiers Rive orders for their
letters to be sent home with their belong
ings and they would say good by : and
start for the firing line, assured that they
would never return, and I never heard of
one whose premonition proved wrong.
Would I enlist again? Oh. yes; you see, I
am sort of a military animalâ fond of pa
rade and gunpowder. I gruess I inherit
this trait from my ancestors, but I want
v r- =:. now, and this week we are mus
t>>r- d out. It will seem like a luxury to
be able to wear civilian clothes attain."
"And a valet, Lieutenant Lawrence?"
"Indeed ( yes; T am not too fond of
work, but I am not going *ln for society."
Here he unlocked a trunk and drew out
a volume of legal papers. "This Is the
bundle that locates my luck," and I read
over his shoulder the clause stating:
"Article No. Iâ Beginning at the most
easterly corner of a patent of 94.030 acres
of land, granted in the year 1770, to Henry
Glen, and others, commonly called the
Jersey Field Patent, etc.," and after
wading through much that I didn't un
derstand legally, I came to his attorney's
signatureâ "T. Almern Griffin, Rensse
laer. New York."
"What are my plan? ror the future? I
shall stop over at Denver for a brief time
and then proceed to New York to settle
up the estate. I haven't really made ex
tensive plans as yet. I am particularly
fond of music and studied the violin for
four years and in all probability somÂ«
day will give it further attention, but
just at present my ambitions are wholly
military."
"And not domestic?"
"Wellâ noâ but do you know I think the
girls of Virginia charming."
"Really; and perhaps you can remem
ber one who Is patlcularly so?"
"No; but I expect to find one some day,
and when I do, I'll lay aside my military
ambitions."
Then this knight of fortune and war
was called to officers' meeting and ever
since I have wondered if all men ac
cepted wealth with Lieutenant Law
rence's quiet philosophy; if the friend

soldier's cap. pulled it well down over
my face and stretched myself out as
long as I could make myself and looked
like a real soldier.
"After awhile a policeman came along
and I thought he was after me, sure â
but he went right by and then a Red
Cross woman found me and told me if
I would come off the ship she would
make me the finest kind of a suit with
brass buttons and told me to come out
to the Presidio the next day and she
would have my measure taken and get
me a pass on the next transport. Like
a gilley I believed her. The next day
I went out and what do you think she
gave me? A cream puff!
"After that I spent most of my time
after I left school at the water front.
"The day before the Grant left I
went on board with the casuals and
hid in the ventilator. I found that
preity uncomfortable and there was al
ways danger of dropping down, so I
kept wy eye c-pen tor the officers and
lieutenant Jforatio J. Lawrence.

I made for the bunk and crawled un
der it.
"Gee whiz, but wasn't I tired of my
narrow quarters. The iron wasn't al
together like a feather bed, butâ l knew
if I got out before we left the bay that
I was a goner.
"I could hear the people shouting and
talking and I thought they never would
haul up the anchor. Honest, It seemed
a longer time under the bunk than the
whole trip to Manila. I ached all over â
and was seasick, too. and on the third
day out of Frisco I crawled out and wa3
that hungry I didn't care whether I
â was caught or not. I couldn't stand up
at first, I was so cramped.
"Then the captain saw me the first
thing and said:
" 'You young rascal â what are you
doing here?'
"I told him I was too hungry to talk.
He was a first-rate follow, for he took
me right down and gave me a fine lay
out. I ate like one of these boa con
etrictors. My, but I was hungry. Then
tie marched me up to the commanding
officer and he asked me all sorts of
questions: if I had a father and a
mother and what I meant by stowing
away, and if I wasn't sorry that I left
home, and when I said no, he said: "I'll
put you off at Hono-lulu.' I was afraid
of that, so I made all the money I
could on thn way over. I helped in the
saloon, I blacked boots and chored after
the officer's messenger when he wasn't
in sight, and made myself handy in
general â and wasn't sassy â and, by the
time we reached Hono-lulu I had enough
saved to buy me some clothes.
"I was lucky and got aboard all right
at Honolulu. I climbed in one of the
square portholes and got under the
bunk again untiL we got outside of

"When we g-ot to Manila I had $3

But the soldiers were awful pood to

brought word into the camp that my
brother was on board the Shermanâ
but sick in the hospital.
"Then I went right back with boitm

the Sherman's little boats and went cut

awfully badâ and I took my little

nice things for him to eat and he
wouldn't taste a thing for a long time
until I said to him: "Ain't you ashamed
of yourself: Now you eat these dainties

his life. I don't know about that, butâ
I'm glad I went and I'd do it over

And this is the story that the stow

who went to the battlefield all for thÂ«
love of a brother.

Vq. KRUGER, President of the Trans

L/ lie character to-day to Interview.
A, Upon being introduced you first
conclude that he hae been greatly over
estimated. He seems nothing more than
a shrewd old hunter who. by constant
contact with wild animals and savage
Kafllrs. has developed a wariness that
makes him suspicious of everything and
everybody. He does not have the "pene
trating eye" usually ascribed to great
men. On* thÂ« contrary, a puff of flesh
underneath his eyes, as a rule, permits
one to see but a narrow gleam, giving one
the impression of shiftiness.
His legs are so short and slender that
you wonder how they bear the weight of
a heavy, thick and solid body. His head
Is big. with nose and ears to match, and
his neck concealed by beard, hair and
coat-collar, so that you cannot determine
whether or not he indulges in neckwear.
At home he is usually puffing a short
briar pipe, and as he handles this you no
tice that the thumb of his left hand is
missing. There is a story in connection
â with this that his Honor will tell you be
tween puffs if he 13 in the mood. It gives
an idea of the grit which Is a character
istic of the old Boers.
STORIES OF PHYSICAL, COURAGE.
Kruger when a young man was out
hunting hartebeest one day with a rifle
â which had not been U6ed for a long time.
While he was tinkering with a charge the
gun exploded, tearing his left thumb into
ehred3. Kruger's companions wanted to
give up the hunt and hurry to the nearest
Furgeon, but the intrepid young Boer re
fused. Taking out his hunting-knife, ho
placed the lacerated thumb on the stock
of the rifle and amputated it himself. By
tying about the stump a piece of rawhide
he stopped the flow of blood, and winding
around it his red handkerchief he con
tinued the sport.
Physical robustness and courage have
contributed greatly toward Kruger's suc
cess as the leader of a nation. He is ab
solutely fearless though not reckless, and
Eince boyhood has known how to act
quickly in an emergency. Unlike other
famous men. little has been told of his
personal history. None but the older gen
eration of Boers know much about it, and
they regard it as sort of divine narrative
that is not to be irreverently discussed.
All through his life Kruger has had
narrow escapes from death, and his ca
reer if detailed fully would be thrilling.
When only 14 years old he and a little
Bister strayed away from the laager down
In Cape Colony where the elder Kruger
had settled or. emigrating from Germany,
and while playing were suddenly attacked
by a leopard. Young Kruger's only
weapon was a jackknife, but, shielding
his sister with one arm, he met the vicious
spring of the leopard with the other, and
after a bloody struggle succeeded In stab
bing it to death.
One is hardly warranted, either, in
speaking slightingly of "Oom" Paul's
legs, for they once ran a race that made
him famous all through the native tribes
in South Africa. A Kaffir chief had be
come cek-brated for his running ability,
and had never been beaten until chal
lenged by a number of young Boers, who
chose Kr-jÃer to represent them. It was
decided that the two should run for twelve
hours, and the man leading at the end of
that time was to have some sort of a
prize. At the end of eleven hours the
Kaffir dropped In his tracks unconscious,
while Kruger kept on to the finish, and,
according to one of his companions, was
bo fresh then that he took part in a
bunting trip.
It is the upprarance of rough hardihood
and unkempt personal attire that first im
presses one on meeting "Oom" Paul, but A

fold gradually his mental power you

view recently for publication j^M
â with the understanding that
the Boer side should be tt^t

view-point, first inquir-
Ir.g i: I were a spy
from Cecil Rhodes.
On being assured to
the contrary by a
number of
V- a ad mem-
tiers who
were pres-
ent, he
followed
it up
by another customary question, turning
on me suddenly and asking: "What Is
your religion?"
These two inquiries give an Insight into
Kruger's life. His first duty, he believes,
Is to God, and his second to Rhodes,
whom he detests like a poisonous reptile.
But for Rhodes, Mr Kruger says, all
would be peace and quietness in the
Transvaal, So long as this man is in
South Africa there is no rest for the
. Boers, and their â¢ secret service agents
may be found on every street In Johan
nesburg, on the lookout for Uitlander
conspiracies.
Prom all outward appearances, Oom
Paul is intensely pious, and though the
English insist that it is all hypocrisy,
there is no proof that Kruger does not
live In strict accordance with his preach
ing. He was confirmed in 1842 by the
Rev. Daniel Lindlay. an American mis
sionary, and from that day to this has
led a severely Christian life after the pre
cepts laid down by John Calvin. He can
quote nearly the whole Bible, and this has
served him well in a secular way. for he
has learned from It to speak In parables,
terse epigrams that are readily Inter
preted by his followers, and have more
force than the most brilliant rhetorical
flights.
Kruger, in addition to his other accom
plishments, is by far the best preacher in
the Transvaal, and the Dutch Reformed
Church boasts of some capable men there.
He occupies the pulpit In a modern brick
edifice across the street from his homo
about once a month, and always talks to
standinging room only. He uses no notes,
but speaks offhand from a text, and does
not hesitate to sprinkle a little humor
in the discourse. In his speeches before
the Road he quotes Scripture generously,
and even more so In conversation.
As for his private life, that seems to be
exemplary. After rising he prays for a
long time in his room, and "talks over
with the Lord" the questions of the day.
When he develops a conviction In this
way he proceeds to act on it. Kruger's
piety once nearly cost him his life. A
good many years ago he suddenly disap
peared, and when he failed to show up a
searching party -was made up to hunt
for him. At the end of three days they
found the future president, who was then
a field cornet, lying face down on the open
veldt. He had been praying three days
and nights steadily, without food or
water, and was nearly dead. When car
ried back and revived, he explained that
he had done it as a chastisement for his
sins.
Two stories the Uitlanders relate to off
set Kruger's pious disposition. One wat
printed in a Natal â¢ aper during my A
sojourn there, and I did not see re- M
futed, though I can not vouch for its
accuracy. The writer accused Oom *^k
Paul of punishing one of his Kaf-
fir boys once by tying him un- m^k
der his wagon, spreading out
legs and arms ami making
them fast to the axles. The m^M
boy was hauled for two
days in this position.de-
clared the writer. On a^M
another occasion
Kruger, when he
was trekking. lust
an ox and could
not find an-
other to take
its place, so _^fl
he hitched _^fl
>' P a
Kaffir
in the team and completed the Journey.
This chap Is still living near Dreikopjes,
in the Orange Free State, at a ripe old
age, so the experience does not seem to
have Injured him. In fact, he seems rath
er proud of the distinction.
When it comes to treatment of thÂ«
blacks, however. Englishmen must remain
immured in glass houses. A native will
take his chances of good 'treatment with
a Boer every time, though his life Is a
mighty unpleasant one at the best.
The first question I put to Oom Paul
was why he did not give the Ultlander
the right to vote, which the English put
forth as their chief cause of complaint.
Mr. Kruger smoked hard for a moment,
then laid down his pipe, and placing his
hands on his knees, said: "A man can
not serve two masters. Either he will
hate the one and cling to the other, or
despise the one and love the other. Now,
the Englishman wants to do this. He de
mands the franchise from me, desires to
become a burgher, and yet when it comes
to trouble he would forsake us In a mo
ment and claim the protection of the
Queen. How can I give such men the
chance to vote? They do not take any
Interest In our country. They have not
come here to settle. They wish us no
good. I want to be fair with every onÂ«
who cornea here to live, and when he haÂ»

developing the country. Only the Boers
are tit for that. But this surging mob is
discontented. Nearly every one gambles
in stocks, horse racing or poker, and
when lie loses it is attributed to the
Boer Government. Ninety-nine men out
or a hundred have come there to "take
a flyer," and it is immaterial to them
wno is running: the government.
Not so with Mr. Rhodes and the Eng
lish Colonial Office, however. There is
the stain of Majuba Hill and the Jame
son raid to be wiped out and $100,000,000
to be made from the gold mines, and
England will never be happy, therefore,
until she gets possession of the country,
lock, stock and barrel. The only thing
that stands in her way is that old. sleepy
looking fellow, who is now turning very
gray from constant worry and bowed
with care that gives his face a look of
world weariness.
Mr. Kruger related to me graphically
and briefly the history of the Boers from
the time they settled in Cape Colony,
whence they were driven out by the
English, until they settled in the Trans
vaal. On this great trek they killed 6000
lions, out of which number Kruger him
self killed 250. They fought their way
step by step until they finally reached the
long ridge known as the Witwatersrand,
where they settled, all unconscious of the
hidden wealth. "It seemed so poor," said
Mr. Kruger, "that even the English did
not begrudge it. So we established a
government, developed a constitution and
laid the foundation for a nation. We
built towns, cultivated the soil and were
making great progress and living peace
fully when gold was discovered. â  Then
new and perplexing questions arose and
England immediately became avaricious,
but we were not willing to give up the
country which we had developed by the
sweat of our brow, and so there was Ma
juba Hill. You know about that?" Here
Mr. Kruger blinked slyly and a laugh
went around among the Boers. "So,
now." continued Oom Paul, taking up
his pipe and dropping into parables, "the
gold fields are. like a beautiful rich young
woman. Everybody wants her and when
they cannot get her they do not want any
one else to possess her."
"Can the English starve you out?" I
then asked Oom Paul.
"If the Lord wills it/ yes," he replied.
If not, the English can build a wall
around us as high as Jericho and we will
live and prosper." By cutting off all sup
plies the English military expects and
hopes to speedily bring the Boers to
terms in event of war. Against this
Kruger has provided by building store
houses and granaries, where meat and
grain are kept in great quantities.
The great drawback to the Transvaal
is that she, lacks a .sea port. The most
convenient one is Delagoa Bay, owned by
the Portuguese. As Portugal Is mort
gaged to England, the latter country con
trols it. I asked Mr. Kruger If he intend
ed taking this port, but he only replied:
"Cursed be he who removes his neighbor's
landmarks."
Towering over Johannesburg lea big
fort, and working in subterranean pas
sages the Boers, it Is said, have under
mined the whole town, Â«vÂ«n to Commls
sloner street, where the pride of Johan
nesburg's buildings are located. The
Boers can muster 30.000 men, all well
armed and good marksmen. They have
warehouses full of ammunition, and could
undoubtedly, with their present defenses
and power to wreck Johannesburg and
the mines, afford sufficient menace to
Great Britain to make her hesitate.
Mr. Kruger is now 7ti years old, and
has been elected to the Presidency four
times. His salary Is $3.i,000 a year, with
$1500 for coffee. This he drinks Mack, and
so hot that the burghers say it will scald
the hair off a dog. His life has certainly
been a remarkable one. and at different
stapes he has been a farmer. herdAnan,
hunter, soldier, clergyman. Ehnbassador,
triumvir, financier, head or the army, and
is now serving: his fourth term as Presi
dent. In recent years be has bought and
sold land a good deal, and is reputed to
iic very wealthy. His habits and method
of living are so simple, however, that he
could have saved nearly all his salary in
these years, which would give him a tidy
fortune.
As he closed our interview Mr. Kruprei
went across the hall into a low ceiUnged,
whitewashed room and leaned for a ;no
ment over a placid faced, motherly little
woman, who was seated on a rocking
chair, darning stockings. This was Mrs.
Kruger, who. though one never hears of
her, Interested me mightily, because she

Starting with the total amount of energy
stored in the sun and the fact that the orb
of day is continuously distributing energy
equivalent to the work of seven men for

calculates that it will require 3,375.090.000
years of outpouring before a sensible di
minution of the quantity of energy nven
out can be detected. Up to this distant
period mountains will stand, rivers will
run. plants will grow and animal life W'ill

think of her as the first lady of the land.

Mr Phil does not base his opinion
upon sentimental grounds, but usea argu
roents and Illustrations In support of hla
opinion that must appeal to v : "" :ii , used
to logical methods of reasoning. Ha qi }o tea
Scripture to prove that the writers of the
Bible fever tor a moment believed that
their animals would not enjoy Immortal
ity with them. Job spoke of the spirit of
the man and the spirit of the beu.st. and
other of the prophets made use of ex
pressions that showed Plainly that in. 1 '
was one subject upon which all men ht-ld
the same opinion. But Mr. Phillips Und
one of his strongest arguments in ti;o
origin and definition of the word â¢ para
dise " a word always used to denote the
future life. It is found In all the ancient
languages from the Sanskrit to the Crieek,
and In every instance it Implies the same
thingâ a beautiful park or pleasure Â«.ir
den inhabited by every kind of harmless
beast and bird. Here man may spend
eternity surrounded by those whom he
has known and loved during, his life on
sari li
The opinion is by no means a new one,
although it has not been accepted by ,
modern Christians. In nearly every in
stance the Eastern philosophers agreed
that If man was Immortal and there was
any life beyond the threshold of the shad
ows animals must be destined to enjoy a
similar fate. , . ,
Mr. Phillips does not stop with the re
ligious side of the question, however. He
calls science to his aid and from it draws
arguments that none of his opponents
have yet been able to overcome. On one
occasion he said:
"Sclonca tell* us that the structure
which we call the body i. composed of
atoms In perpetual flux, constantly disin
tegrating, constantly passing away. The
body of childhood Is not the body of early
youth. Once In a dozen years the whole
atomical structure of the body is changed.
But the identity of man remains the game
in spite of all. Memory will, the inner
consciousness, are ail there. We change
the material but man's true self remains.
Death is the final dissolution of partner
ship between spirit and body. If this ar
gument is sound it applies equally to man
and beast.
"Take another view of life as merely a
force. 2s*o form enn be lost in the uni
verse. What Is the relation of animal
consciousness to the mighty life which
pulses through things temporal and eter
nal? Why should It cease or come under
the exceptional law of annihilation?
Again, we believe in a just God. Surely
there Is some compensation for our dumb
friends for what they suffer here, some
reward for their loyalty, their faithful-
ness, their courage and the higher facul
ties they manifest.
'â¢To the practical mind and to t lie con
templative mind the same thought occurs
and is entertained. This moral convictl in
of a future, which protests against the
extinction of life with the dissolution â  f
the atoniical embodiment, to the I
mind must also include and pi
against the extinction nf the life of other
animals as well as that of man."
With such arguments Mr. Phillips has
opened a discussion that has extended

world, and it is cafe to Bay that there are

was not an over-courageous man. refused
to move to the Winter Palace and retired
to the palace of his grandfather, Paul I.
at Gatchina. I know that old building,

from the tops of which secret staircases
lead to the Emperor's study. 1 have seen
the trapdoors in the study for suddenly

staircase leading to underground prisons
and. to an underground passage which
opens on a lake. All the palaces of Paul I
had been built on a similar plan. An un
derground gallery was dug around the
Anichkoft palace of Alexander 111. and
was supplied with automatic electric ap
pliances to protect it from being under
mined by the revolutionists.
A secret league for the protection of the
Czar was started. Officers of all grades
were induced by triple salaries to join It.
and to undertake voluntary spying in all
classes of society. Comical scenes fol
lowed, of course. Two officers, without
knowing that they both belonged to the
league, would entice each other into a dis
loyal conversation during a railway Jour
ney and then proceed to arrest each other,
only to discover at the last moment that
their plans had been labor lost. This
league still exists in a more official shape,
under the name of Okhrana (Protection),
and from time to time frightens the pres
ent Czar with all sorts of concocted dan
gers" in order to maintain Its existence.
A still more secret organization, he
Holy League, was formed at the same
time, under the leadership of the brother
of the Czar. Vladimir, for the purpose of
opposing the revolutionists in different
ways, one of which was to kill off those of
the refugees who were supposed to have
been the leaders of tne late conspiracies.
I was of this number. The Grand DuKe
violently reproached the officers of the
league for their cowardice, regretting that
there were none among tnem who would
undertake to kill such refugees; and an
officer, who had been a page de chambre
at the time I was in the corps of pages,
was appointed by the league to carry out
this particular work. Skobeloff, the hero
of the Turkish war, was asked to Join
this league but hp blankly refused.

dogs," remarked the License Collector's
deputy wearily, as he entered for the
thousandth and odd time the name, ad
dresb and full particulars of a two-dol
lar canine In the register.
There was a long siring of people of all
sorts and conditions waiting to contri
bute {2 to the city treasury, merely to
secure their pet dogs against the pre
datory poundman. Some of them, well
dressed ladles, carried Fido or Jip, or
whatever its name might be, under
their arms, evidently under the impres
sion that it is necessary to produce
your dog in order to register it. The
men, being more practical, for the most
part left their dogs at home, and the
work of registration went merrily on.
A roughly dressed, horsey looking
youth, with a peculiarly stupid face,
blocks the way for ten minutes. He
was sent by his employer the day be
fore to register two dogs, and in some
unaccountable manner gave the names
of two wrong animals.
"Do please alter the papers," he
pleads, with tears in his eyes, "or I'll
lose my job if you don't."
The request is altogether Irregular, it
involves the erasure of several lines on
the neatly kept register; but at last,
out of sheer pity for the distressed
youth the deputies yield, and he de
parts rejoicing, having, it is to be
hoped, saved his job
Then the waiting line surges forward
cue step, and ;i well-dressed business
man, wearing an air of contented pros
perity, iteps to the desk. Just sut ii a
man as one would expect lo be tht
owner of a champion Dane or a St.
Bernard of high lineage. Hut when
asked the breed of his dog. he describee
it as yellow, and as bearing the fiuing
name of Tramp.
"Must be a valuable yellow dog to be
worth a $2 fee," I remarked.
The man smiled indulgently. "Well,
it isn't much of a dog, 1 admit, rather
a bit of a sooner, in fact. But my
little boy's fond of it. You needn't
laugh at me for keeping a yellow dog.
1 had the finest fox terrier in the city,
an., it turned up its toes and died with
out any reason that 1 could discover.
Then I got A beautiful Irish setter, and
it took a walk one morning and never
came back. Now I've got a yellow dog
that you can't kill or lose and I'm
happy."
At first sight it seems rather super
fluous to enter the names of dogs in
the register, because the knowledge is
not of any particular value as a means
of identification.
"We do it to prevent fraud," explains
the deputy. "People who either find or
steal a tag come up here to get dupli
cate certificates, and then we ask them
what the name of their dog is. The
question floors them. Anybody, if they
have their certificate, can get a dupli
cate tag on payment of J5 cents, but it
cannot bo used on another dog."
As a matter of fact, however, it often
is. Lots of people who have two or
more dogs apply for duplicates, pre
tending they have lost the original.
They save $1 75 by this little device.
Another plan is to make one tag do
duty for several dogs by changing the
collar. The Inconvenience of this
method, however, is that you can only
have one dog free at a time. The Li
cense Collector is powerless to check
these evasions, nor can the poundman
help him. If a dog has a tag on it is
exempt from capture, and the pound
dies to the exclusion of all others, wriUa

Still, if entering the names is of no
particular value, it has one unexpected
effect. The register is converted into a
huge comic annual, full of the most ex
traordinary titles ever invented. What
do you think, for instance, of a butch
er who names his coach dog "rihin
bone." still more appropriately minded
is a bootblack who has called his black
dog Shine. A Gordon setter rejoices- in
the extraordinary name of Bangs, and
a cocker spaniel is fittingly entitled
Charcoal.
The deputies, in their own little way,
do their best t" make the register a
humorous document. It seems strange,
but in lots of cases people who are will
ing to pay ?2 for registration do not
know the name or breed of their dog.
Some owners, with cheerful self-abase
ment, enter their animals as mongrels.
The deputies help others out by resort
ing to the time honored legal Doe. Thus
a dog may be of the John Doe breedâ
"don't kno\." would have sounded bet
ter. Or an animal, accord'ng to its sex,
may be either John or Jane Doe. One
dog of the John Doe breed Is fittingly
named Muggins.
