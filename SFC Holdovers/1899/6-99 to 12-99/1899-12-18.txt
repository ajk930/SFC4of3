h" is not and of feeling; th" very unique
sensation of tÂ»Â»-inp dead.
Ii name is Howard Tuttle. He is a

fart young fellow, who has found his
Struggle in life difficult enmiKh to prevent
him from being too particular in his oc
cupations. He says that he has been a
prize tiÃhter. a foot racer, a ball player
and a cook, hut it was not until the k\
aminer Interfered in his affair; that he
became absolutely a dead one.
To those that may haw a similar tri

of the Examiner ho says ii Is not un
pleasant to see one s self rl''tureil as a
rollicking, reckless prodigal son. cultured
through the care and indulgence of rela

endowed with the graces that dpture the

as the young lady
whose name the Ex

several months, and
he never enjoyed

story I rough! to him by the Dodge Cave
Indians, which goes to prove that the
bark seen on the Point, which wan none

foundered. The Indians watched the

That th.- I "ulusa has gone down and that
Captain E warts*, his wife and the crew
have Rone down \ ja sailor's crave In the
waters they have lied so long seems to
ho a certainty. Mar.. have surmised tlint
the bark was lost, hut the surmises
have been based on nothing more than the
fact that she was long overdue, coupled
with that of her un.sea worthy condition,
she not having been repaired property
after the accident she sustained when en
tering Kahului on her last trip from fc.m
Francisco. The letter received from the
lighthouse keeper, who has been unable
to get word here for some time past owing
to the collapse of the telegraph wire, was
as follows:
"On tne morning or tne imh two or my
boys heard some rille shots. Thinking it
was some one signaling to them they re
turned toward Ronilla I'oint. On the same
rock that the Duel* of Argyle struck
they saw a bark, the identity of which
they could not ascertain. There was a
thick fog. with light, baffling winds, heavy
rain and a heavy surf on the beach. hen
first seen she was lying over considerably;
her anchor was down, but her stern, as
she swung, caught on the rock. A He si a
struck her and she swung clÂ»-ar nnd
straightened up to her anchor wit) her
head out to â Â«â¢, hut her stern well in the
small bay at the Chusapis waterfall, be
tween and within a few yards of the
wrecks of the Duchess of Argyle and the
Puritan.
"The boys, being unable to cross the
river to get home, ran down to Kllde,
about two miles east of Bonilla. where
they could open the wire, and then tapped
with the ends of the wire, calling me, and
said there was a vessel- on shore at
Bonllla. There being no Indians here I
telephoned to Cloose to my eldest SOB to
come vp 1 at once and bring assistance,
which he did. At 1 a m. the tog cleared,
when I saw* â  bark dangerously near
Bonilla. She was heading about west, but
the wind hauled and she headed off short.
When the boys returned they said it was
the bark they had reported, that a breeze
sprung up off shore which enabled her to
get clear, but they think she was badly
damaged and shipped her cable. It was
a miracle that she ever got clear, es
pecially with the heavy surf runnlnp.
She seemed a medium-sized vessel,
rather smart looking, painted black with
a white stripe around her. She had
double top-gallant yards and 1 think a
Bkysall Several pieces of redwood were
picked up near where the bark went
ashore.'
Asa Drinkwater says that when he was
on his way down ho heard of the founder
ing of the vessel from the Dodge Cave
Indians. The Indians said the bark, which
from the description given must have
been the same one seen ashore on i kmlUa
Point, was carried up In a, northwesterly
direction before the heavy gales, and
when the vessel was abo opposite Long
Beach it was seen to roil from aide to
side and went down rapidly as though
her bottom had fallen out or her seams
parted. This was about the beginning of
December. Many different Indians told
the prospector the same story of the
foundering of the vessel, and he says he
has every reason to believe the report Is
true. Since the Indians told the pros.
pector of the disaster th. have gone to

and they have not reported the founder-
Ing of the vessel to the local customs. An
effort will, however, be made to reach
them and g<t their report.
After the vessel went down they
watched for boats, but saw none. Then
the) searched the bcarh and rocks for
wreckage without avail.. Not a man or
v*>stlrrÂ»> of anything from th* wreck
seems to have reached the shore. Of

everything seems to point to that having
been the case.
HAS BEEN IN HARD LUCK.
Colusa Was on Her Way to Depart-
ure Bay for Repairs.
The Colusa Is well known In the San
Francisco trade, having been owned here
for nearly a generation. In IS*O nhe waa

the principal sufferers by the loss of thÂ«
vessel. In those days O. P. Smith & Co.
were the managing owners, but during thÂ«
last few years A. 11. Paul has looked after
the vessel.
The Colusa left here on September â¢Â»
last for the Hawaiian Islands. During .1
storm she wÂ«-nt ashore and was sot off
again after some difficulty. She was
taken to Kahului. where an examination
showed that her forefoot and part of thÂ«
shoe was gone. It was decided to send
her to the sound for repairs, and on Oc
tober 21 she sailed In ballast for De
parture Bay. On November M Th- fall
In telling of the then overdue fleet said:
"The old Colusa is out thirty-nine days
from Kuhu'.ul for Departure Bay. and sh<*

anxiety is felt, as she was. ashore on rtv

TIME FOR MEDIATION
SAID TO HAVE ARRIVED
NEW YORK, Dec. 17.â The Journal has
this from Berlin: it Is the consensus of
opinion In diplomatic circles that the Tu
gcla river battle furnishes a test for
the tendering -of mediation by the Eu
ropean powers in the war between (.rout
Hrltain â nd the Transvaal republic, Euro
pean Intervention was considered im
probable until England, by some brilliant
victory, should have recovered her mili
tary prestige or have shown her Inability
to conquer the Boers. The highest mili
tary authorities of Germany declare that
Buller's defeat Is of decisive significance,
and that he will be unable to assume the
offensive for some time; and even If he
should rally his forces for another at
tack, it is believed the result will be fully ,
as disastrous as his first attempt against
the doughty enemy.
Some action toward mediation very soon
is expected.

no doubt that even the Cabinet had.

defensive strength. As a result of the
meeting on Saturday of the National De

ABOLISH THE MILL-WOMAN
Rev. George Smith Suggests Remedies for 1
the Evil He Is Preaching
Against.
S- PAT^ *Â°" 17 â - Oeorpe. D. Smith of the People's Church, whose
*rrumorits against women wagÂ» earners have attracted so much atten
xion ail over the country, to-night presented his solution of tho problem.
IT. Smith said:
th. ââ t. Â£\ V * rloU(1^ vituperation In regard to my recent utterances on
tne Question <* laboring women not a ningle statement has been shown to be
xaiso or a single argument proven unsound. My statistics were taken from the
very latest of the reports. ThÂ© awful conditions remain unchanged. The in
crease of child labor has been paralleled !>v the increase In the labor of girls
between 14 and IS years, which Is falsely called woman labor. The conditions
or former times, when women did weaving and the like at home, were condi
tions of ten labor, but at any rale these women produced for themselves
and their families, and under wholesome unitary and moral conditions, But
It Is not enough to show that the world is better off than it was formerly; it is
Incumbent on my critics to show th.it It is as well off as It may be.
"I am an optimist, but not a cross optimist, who believes that a.l things
â re so good that it is no us* trying to make them better. Progress is not blind,
and now more than ever ths evolution of the race should be guided by intel
ligent foresight. l ;;m not under obligation to point out a remedy because I
disclose a wrong. But I have suggestions to make. Four State* forbid women
to work In mines. These laws should be extended to about one hundred of
their present occupations. which are tno severe and too unhealthy. Then all
girls under IS yÂ»>iirs phould be forbidden to be employed In commercial and
Industrial pursuits. These measures would cut down woman labor one-half.
Then a movement, largely social and moral, but also by women organizing.
FhouM be made effective to give women who do equal work with men the
Rame wag^s. Thus the family standard of wages would supplant the individ
ual standard. The various assaults upon the family must be resisted, for It is
thÂ© social unit. The Madonna with her own child In her own arms must not
be dethroned to make room for the public woman.

CANAL BILL MAY
YET BE PASSED
â  to The < an.
NEW YORK. Drc. 17.-The Journal has
the. following from Washington: Newt
has boon received In Washington that the
concession of the Nlcaraguan Government
to the Cragln-Eyro-Graoe syndicate Is to
he canceled and that the Nioaraguan
Ouvoninipnt Intends to extend the life of
the Maritime Canal Company. Th.- United
States Government has made representa
tions to the Nlcar.-iguan Government that
this .-xtonsion should be granted. When
this Is dune it will permit a continuance
of the plan suggested in Senator Morgan's
bill In the last Congress for the con
struction of the canal by the United
States through the Instrumentality of the
Maritime Canal Corporation.
The CniKin-Kyre-Graoe syndicate, which
obtained a concession from Nicaragua to
begin work after the concession of the
Maritime Canal Company had lapsed, de
sired to take the place of the Maritime
Canal Company and receive profits that
would accrue through this Government's
assumption of work. The syndicate, now
ever, failed to secure a concession from
Costa Rica, through whose territory a
portion of the projected canal will run. j
Costa Rica declines to give the syndicate
the concession, .>!.â ! It* privileges are.
therefore, of little value.
An effort will be made during this Con
gress to put through the bill. passage of
which was frustrated last year by lobby
ists t.f the transcontinental railroads, "it
will be again antagonized by these Inter
ests, anil the men who secured deliy
through appointment of the new Walker '
Commission will plead that Congress
xliould wait until the commission reports,
â¢ighteen months or two years hence The
Senate committee, of which Morgan Is
chairman, will probably meet this week to
prepare a bill and agree upon a pro
gramme. The committee is overwhelm
ingly In favor of the bill, and the Senate
drspjto organized opposition has twice
passed the bill In some form.
A prominent member of the committee
was assured this w.ek by the State De
partment that no obstacles would be In
terposed by the Nlcaraguan Government
to prosecution of work under the Mari
time Can-d Company's concession The.
iT^sldent said to the same Senator that It
was his ambition to see this great work
thoroughly Initiated during his admlnis
t ration. â
liritish Interests will oppose the con
struction of the canal and cau?<? delay as
much as Possible. Not only will there be
British political opposition to abrogate
the ( layton-Hulwer treaty, but also Brit

MAY PREVENT THE LAYING
OF THE PACIFIC CABLE
Under an Old Spanish Grant the Eastern Exten

Exclusive Privilege.

LINGTON HOTEL. WASHING
TON. Dec. 17.-Tho United States
Government â if will probably feel
the baneful â¢â¢â¢â¢â¢ -â  of a cable mo
nopoly, for which Spain is respon*l
| We. Spain granted a concession to the
Eastern Extension Cable Company, under
which that corporation has the exclusive
landing riÃhts for all cables Joining the
several islands of the Philippines or con
necting them with other countries.
It is apparent that the effect of the ta
ble concession granted the Eastern Com
pany will be to cause that corporation to
protest against the violation of its rights
i 'â¢> the I'nlted States, which proposes to
run a line from a point on the California
coast to Luzon, via the Hawaiian. Mid
way or Wake Islands, and to establish
international and governmental cable
communication with Japan., between the
islands of Luzon and Formosa, and with
China between the Island of Luzon and
some commercially desirable Chinese port.
The laying of this cable will naturally in
jure the value of the Eastern Extension
Company's concession and materially re
duce Its business, now conducted over the
Hongkong-Manila line.
Under the decision of Secretary Root in
the matter of the concession held by the
Western Union, this Government, under
the terms of the treaty of peace, will be
required to respect the rights possessed
by the Eastern Extension Company. This
is apparently the opinion of Major R. E.
Thompson, who was chief signal officer of
the army of the Philippines, whose an
nual report is published as an appendix
to the report of Brigadier General Greely,
chief signal ofllcer.
"The Hongkong cable." Major Thomp

BURNS' CANDIDACY
INJURING QUAY
Friends of the Pennsyl
vanian Are Angry.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK. Dec. 17.-Th.Â» Herald has
the following from Washington: Quay's
friends and supporters are on the ragged
edge. They appreciate the desperate
â It tuition of the Pennsylvania boss, and
are moving heaven and earth to save him
from rejection by the Senate. They are
angry because Colonel Burns' malodorous
record has been used to the disadvantage
of Quay, for it has been made to appear
that If Quay Is admitted this precedent
might also cause the Californlan to be
seated. They declare that Burns and
Quay should be disassociated, and that
the Pennsylvania^! should not be. made to
suffer for the sins of Burns.

It is. of course, expected that surh

for it is known that Jlv,. or six Benators

Burns' admission.
If Bums' friends declare the Colonel
will not accept an appointment, this may
Save Quay, although it Is quite well un

GALLANT BRUMBY
CALLED TO REST
Death of Dewey's Flag-
Lieutenant
Ppwlal Dispatch fn Th<Â« Call.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 17.-Lleutenant
Thomas A. Brumby, flag lieutenant to Ad
miral Dowry during the Manila campaign,
who has been 111 with typhoid fever for
several weeks, died at the Garfield Hos
pital shortly after 6 o'clock this evening.
The death of Lieutenant Brumby, while
not unexpected, was â  great shock to Ad
miral Dewey. The relations of the two
for several years have been very Intimate
and a strong friendship had grown up be
tween them. Lieutenant Brumby went
out to the Asiatic station with the ad
miral and bad been there, with him until
they returned to the United States. In
his capacity as flag lieutenant Lieutenant
Brumby was thrown with Dewey prac
tically all the time and acted as his per
sonal representative In many matters of
detail delegated to him by the command
ing officer. He was regarded by the ad
miral as a bright, alert and capable assist
ant, while the devotion of the latter to
the admiral was something marvelous.
The burden of his thoughts during the
latter days of his illness, when his mind
was wrecked with delirium, teemed to be
regarding his work for the admiral.
Lieutenant Brumby was appointed a
naval cadet from Georgia, filtering the
service in 1Â«73. and his present commis
sion dates from August 24, IBSS. He had
been with Admiral Dewey practically all
the time during the past two years. In ;
his report of the battle of Manila Admiral
Dewey spoke In highly complimentary
terms of the gallantry of Brumby and
recommended that he be advanced some
numbers on the list of lieutenants. Ills
recommendation was adopted by the Navy
Department ami the- name sent to the Sen
ate, but together with a number of other
promotions made by the department,
failed to be acted upon. The promotion
recommended placed him about thirteen
on the list of lieutenants and had it been
confirmed he would in less than a year
from now reached the grade of lieutenant
commander.
The lieutenant's death Is the third of
those who were closely associated with
Admiral Dewey at the battle of Manila
who have died since that time, namely:
Captain Orldley, Commander Wood and
Lieutenant Brumby.
Lieutenant Brumby was present) a
sword by the Legislature of Georgia on
October 26. He returned to Washington
about the middle of November.

Continued rains in California, while promising a
prosperous year, arc retarding farming operations in
fomc localites. particularly in the north and alon
the coast, where the soil is too wet to work. Farm
ers are now waiting for drying weather. The move
ment in merchandise continues above the normal for
this time of the year, and almost all lines report an
active demand for goods, with few failures and easy
collections. The bank clearings of the country at
large during the week showed a gain of i, .2 per cent
over the fame week last year, while the failures were
only 218. against 261 in 1898. Thus, from the Atlan
tic to the Pacific, there is not an adverse condition in
trade during thc<e closing weeks of the year, except
the weakness m wheat already mentioned. Tins is a
condition of business not often seen.

In describing what he meant by good citizenship
Mr. Dohnnann said: "A patriotism not alone for
our country at large, not the kind that grows hysteri
cal once every four years when it is a question of
sixteen to one, or something of that kind, not even
the patriotism that becomes enthusiastic over wars.
It is that modest, home made, home patriotism, that
sweeps and paves the streets, that goes down into
the sewers, that looks after our hospitals, schools and
! other public buildings. It is the kind that gave us
self-confidence, that we might again have self-govern

the kind that will make us deserve again to manage

re. It will be historical in its main

â 
No city in the United States, and few, if any. in the
world, are better fitted for festal purposes thai San
Jo?e. The surrounding valley is lovely, the moun
tains are picturesque; the climate perfect, and at this
season of the year days of sunshine there are de
lightful to every sensibility. The homes of the city
and of the orchard embowered suburbs were built
for hospitality and abound with every variety of com
fortable luxury, so that there is nothing to make an
open-air celebration enjoyable that is not found there
in a high degree of excellence.
It is not unlikely the lame of the commemorative
festivities will attract the attention of Eastern people
once more to the winter climate of this section of
California and have the effect of increasing the west
ward tourist travel, which already promises to be
exceptionally large during the winter. If that be so,
San Jose will at once reap the reward due to the
patriotism of her citizens in providing for California
this celebration of her organization as a State in the
Union.
Whether that reward come, however, is at present
not a subject of consideration. The one thing be
fore us, for all who can afford it. is to assist in mak
ing the celebration a State instead of merely a local
affair It is assured that the gathering of the pioneers
will be notable, and the native sons and daughters
. will do their share to attest the pride which Calif.. r
, nians have in the Union by celebrating the day which
organized this State as a part of it. Moreover, th.;
programme announced is a highly interesting' one
and will be an instructive lesson in the history of
those days. From every point of view, therefore^ the
festival merits a large attendance, and it is safe to say
Jlmt if thr rains hold off the reek . m a memory

â¢ ' â¢ Arctic to study the subject and investigate the
es of using the aurora. He says: "The ex
pedition should be well equipped with instruments
and should be composed of men -.vho thorouphlv
understand electricity and the appliances by which it
may be controlled and put to practical purposes. Such
an expedition could also contribute to geographical
and other knowledge either in the north or south
polar regions. Without doubt the north magnetic
pole is the center of the great force in the north
regions, and as this point lies just to the north
ward of the Hudson Ray region, it is. therefore, at
the very threshold of the vast British-American ter
ritory. "
How much of method there may be in this madness
we are not prepared to say. but since it seems we
must have polar explorations they might just as well
be sent out to capture the aurora borealis as to hunt
the North Pole. We know at least that the aurora
is there, for it has been seen, but no one has seen
the pole.
Till". CALL has directed attention to the figures
in the report of the Secretary of the Treasury
showing the cost to the taxpayers of the United
States of the military expenditures brought about by
j the war with Spain and the resulting occupation of the
i Philip] In 1898 our military establishment cost
; $91,092,000, while for [899 the cost is placed at
; $229,841,254, or an increase in a single year of
j $137^49.^54.
These figures are in themselves sufficiently impres
sive, but another interesting contrast has been made
I by the Chicago Chronicle in setting the estimates of
the Secretary of the Treasury of what the total ex
penditures of the Government â¢ ill be in 1001, at
which time it is supposed we shall have peace in the
: Philippines and elsewhere, against the expenditures
lof the last year of Cleveland's administration. The
I table stands thus:

Totals -VSZ.i I2.OOO 55H.629.000
It is to be noted that the estimate of the Secretary
of the Treasury is that in 1001 there will be no dis
turbance among the natives of the Philippines or Cuba
or elsewhere which will require the active operations
of an army. The expenditures he estimates from the
present outlook are to be on a peace basis. What
! the military establishment may cost should the n 1
\ tives of ny of our new possessions continue recal
: citrant is not taken into consideration. Rearing that
I fact in mind, the table affords an instructive study to
; taxpayers.
It will be noticed that the estimates for the legisla
tive, executive, State and Agriculture departments
show very little increase, and that for the Interior is
| not notably large. That for the Postoffice shows a
! decrease, and no estimate is made for the judicial dc
â¢ partment The estimates for the War, the Navy and
; the Treasury departments, however, show a vast in
crease of expenditures. The War Department in
creases from less than $54,000,000 to more than
$190,000,000, the Navy from less than $30,000,000 to
more than $76,000,000, and the Treasury Department
i from less than $77,000,000 to over $162,000,000.
That much is the calculated increase in our ex
! penditures in five years time -the extent to which
; our taxes must be augmented in 1901 over what they
; were in provided we have peace. If we have
j more trouble there will be. of course, more taxes
I Our jingoism, it is true, does not cost anything like
; that of Great Britain, and the Philippines will not
; come as high as the Transvaal, but. considering the
size of the whistle we get. we arc paying about as
dear for it.
If a majority of the member? of the United States
i Senate could only see with the eyes of Senator Quay
! and reason with his logic he never would be de
j feated. He must have been studying some of the
telegraphic victories of the British in South Africa.

The followers of Dan Burns have discovered in the
wharves of San Francisco and in the streets of State
â¢ towns reasons for an extra session of the Legislature.
"PfiMpTTliey may turn their attention to the sewers
and find better reasons to advance their cause.
The followers of Dan Burns have arrived at the
conclusion that as a Senatorial possibility he has
lost all value as a betting proposition. If these
worthies are still looking for a sure-thing proposition
they might safely bet against the Mexican.
Equal suffrage enthusiasts insist that woman has
taken one hundred steps in advancement. That fa

If you have "a large number of canceled

It blew Steadily from the northeast all
of yesterday, but, nevertheless, many of
the steamers due from northern ports
failed to arrive. Saturday night It was
blowing a Wester when the sun went
down. But Sunday morning there was only
a gentle breeze from the northeast. Of
the bar-bound fleet that got out of Coos
Hay the Homer and Arcata arrived, but
the Rival, Empire and Alice Blanchard
have yet to be heard from. The Albion
from Tillamook. the Newsboy and New
burg from Grays Harbor and the Aber

yesterday morning, but did not ret In dur
ing the day. The chances are that they
were delayed by the southwester of Pat

~ Cnlef Whartlnger Henderson had con
siderable trouble In getting Lombard
street wharf ready for the Santa Fe
steamer Thyra. . There were over WOO
sacks of grain stored on the wharf, and
the owner could not be persuaded to
move It. All Friday the chief and As-
Elstant Chief wharfinger Dryden were
kept busy notifying the brokers to get
the grain away, and when they saw that
no notice was being taken of their warn
ings, they set to work and had ail the
grain sent to the warehouse. By reason
of their united efforts there was plenty of
room for the Thyra to discharge earn
yesterday. All the freight will probably
be out to-day and the steamer will then
go to Portland to load flour for the Orient,
he will not come back to San Francisco,
but will complete her loading at San
Diego. â¢
The work of unloading the Kostn
liner Tanls went on yesterday. ThÂ»Â»
nitrate she brought from South America
was unloaded Into bay schooners and
Is being hurried to the powder works,
Where It Is greatly needed. When dis
charged the Tanls will begin loading
wine, oil and general merchandise for
European and South American ports.
For the first tine In eighteen months
there was a lull on the transport wharf
and nearly all hands got a day off. Tho
Flintshire departed with a load of horses
early In the morning, and after thai there
was nothing done. The Grant, which will
be the next vessel to sail, Is almost ready
to leave and will be In first-class trim on
Wednesday morning. Chief Officer Croaky
has his vessel looking like a yacht, and
all that- Is required to have her ready to
sail at â  moment's notice Is her supply
of fresh meat. The transport was In
splendid order when sh>- came into port
and has been kept up to li.r high stand
ard all the time she has been alongside
the wharf.
The contractors for th<Â» blowing up of
Barrel for Bhait) nnd Arch rocks have al
most completed their arrangements. ThÂ«
moorings for the barges have been laid
nnd n derrick erected on Harrel Rock.
This week thÂ«- work of drilling holes In
"the menace to navigation" will begin,
nnd us soon ns they have been sunk far
enough a charm of dynamite will be put
In. and if all goes well Barrel Rock will
be no more. As soon as thru fob has been
successfully accomplished Arch Rock will
be- attacked and Its destruction will be
consummated in a similar manner.

VIII.â AS YOU LIKE IT.

ThÂ« Title of the Piny.
There has been tome dispute as to the
origin and slgnincancc of the name "As
You Like It." It may have been suggest
ed, as some critics have supposed, nnd I
Â«m Inclined to agree with then by the
preface to LodÃe's novel of "Rosalynde "
Lodge says to his readers concerning the
book: "If you like It. so"â that Is, "So
be if or "well and Rood"â an nfllrmatlve
or acquiescent use of "so," which Is not
uncommon in Shakespeare. The Oerman
critic Tleck fancied that the title was
mennt na i reply to Ren Jonson's criti
cisms on the loose and IrrcEular style of
Shakespeare's comedy. Ren was a scholar
nnd believed In the classical rules of dra
matic composition. The free and easy
methods of his brother playwright were
rank heretodoxy In his eyes, and he could
not help sometimes expressing his risht
oous horror at them. In the preface to
"Cynthia's Revels" he had said of his own
play: " 'Tls pood, and If you like It. you
may." and Heck believed that this M||>
fiested to Shakespeare the title for "As
You Like It" as If he had said: "Will,
here Is another of my careless comedies;
take It as you like it." Rut It does not
seem to me at all probable that Shakes
peare would select a name for n play sole
ly or mainly to Indulfce In a little hit at
another authorâ and a hit that would not
be readily understood without an explana
tion.
Whatever may have suggested the title,
i-hakesp.nre Memorial Picture (inllery. Stratford
on-Avon.
I have no doubt that it was adapted a*
fitly expressing the tone and temper of
thÂ« play. This la the view of another
Oermaji I'lrlclâ who In ramming up his
argument says "In fact all (the charac
ters) do exactly hal and â â  they please.
'..â¢â ââ¢ Bach looks upon and shapes life as

smooth In its Row, unlneumiiTed by se
rlous tasks, free from the fitters of defi- I
nlte objects and from Intentions difficult '
to realize; an amusing play of caprice, of
Imagination and of wavering sensations
and feelings."
Charles Lamb called "Love's labor's
Lost" "the comedy of leisure." but. as
Verplanck remarks, "he might have given j
the title In a higher sense to 'Am You Like ,
it. where the pervading feeling is that ;
of a reftnad and tasteful, yet simple and
unaffected throwing off the stiff Mendings'
of artificial society." For myself, I would
call it the ''summer-vacation comedy." 1 1
believe that it was BUCh an "outing" to â¢
Shakespeare himself, after I be completion j
of the aeries of English historical playsâ i
not counting his part of "Henry VIII," ,
which was not written until rome ten
years later. The poet was weary with j
long tarrying In camps and courts, glad j
to escape from the company of kings and i
queens, and to take to the woods for a I
thoroughly unconventional holiday. it !

Dramatic Time in the Play. ;
â¢â¢AÂ» You Like It" affords good illustra- I
lions of Shakespeare's art In the manage
ment of "dramatic time ' Only two or his
plays "The Comedy of Errors' and "The
Tempest"â observe, thÂ»Â» "unities of time
and place." which require that the time
of the action represented shall not exceed
a single day, itiui that the scene tall be
limited either to a single locality or to
places so near that the pvrsonx concerned
can pass from one to another within tut
day. In most of the plays the lime of tne i
action covers several days, months or
years, and the localities are widely sep- I
arnted-England and France. Iluhemla >
and Sicily, etc.
Hut though Shakespeare thus Ignores
the classical law concerning dramatic
time, he follows What may be called an j
artistic law of his own in dealing with
lime, which was not recognized by any
of the critics until about tiitv years ago;
nnd then, as has often happened with Im
portant discoveries, two men detected it i
Independently at th" snme time. In No
vember, 1MI). Professor John Wilson j
("Christopher North") announced this
law In Hlackwood'H Magazine ns "an as
tounding discovery. Illustrating it mln !
utely by an analysis of "Macbeth" nnd (In j
April. IS.V)) of "Othello"; and the Km-. N.
J. iialpin, during the same month of No
vember, published an essay "ii "Dramat
ic Unities In Shakespeare." Illustrating
the same Inw by an analysH of "The Mer
chant of Venice." There could <â  no
question that the two men had been
working Independently and had reached
identical results.
I may mention Incidentally that this Mr.
Hnlptn. who wns an English clergyman
and n good Shakespeare scholar Ithe au
thor of some valuable papers printed by
the old Shakespeare Society of London).
was the father of Charles Graham Ilal
pine (a* I believe he preferred to -poll the
name), better known by his pseudonym
of "Miles O'Reilly." Who came to this |
country In IST.2 and served during the civil
war as colonel In the Federal army, and
wrote much In prose and verse. He died
In I*. I.1 '. eight years after his father did.
The law discovered by Wilson and Hal
pin may be briefly stated thus: Shakes
penro use* two kinds of time In hi* ploys
âone fast, corresponding to the brief time â 
required for the action on the stage: the
other slow. corresponding to the longer
time necessary for the actual succession
of events represented. The law has been
aptly and more concisely designated as
"Shakespeare's two clocks." one of which
goes fast . while the other goes slow.
Apparently this manner of dealing with .
dramatic time was original with Shakes
peare. It Is used by him In all his plays
(except the two I hayÂ« mentioned), nnd
in all Jetails of their action, while It sel
dom. If ever. Is noticeable in other dram
atists.
In "An You Like It" the two kinds of i
time are very easily recognized, nnd I
have therefore Introduced the subjret In
connection with this play. It will be
good exercise for the student to trace the
Indications for himself In other plays
When the banlshme.-.t .if the old duke

In the sixth inning Knell relieved John
son from box work, and what happened to
i.'ri in the seventh looked like fireworks
Â«>n a riotous Fourth of July. Nine runs
iind seven lilts in Â» single Inning gave the
luid.s Â« jipurtunity for sume rare sprint
lag. 1" :iÂ«idliion there were errors in reek

Pop JlanJie. jogged to first on f<.ur bad

Merle* a chanco to muke jÂ»:i error, and
Hulchinsun scored. Knell followed with
another error In <'r<>pi ! 'ng inu ball from
Mosklman's bat. and Uarula crossed the

Johnson's curves and Dunlvavy scored.
Two runs vÂ«re the All-Oafs portion

The fourth inning brought a few flut
ter* to fans. Slianahan earned tirst on
a.n honest hit. McCarthy whs hit by the
ball and he went to base, soon fol
lowed by Knell, who bunted safely. lib
the bags tilled Sieflani settled down.
Johnson flew to Mosktman, Shanahan
scoring after the out. Van lialiren Hew

a lightning shot to left Held and Brock

All-California lnlVld pent Lange over the
plate and the I Mules were happy, with a
bad of two runs.
AftÂ«T this came the seventh, which gave
the majority of l>udes a chance to cross

BERLIN, Dec. 18. Most of the Her'.ln
pap- rs, !i~ well ,tv those throughout the
country, comment upon General Buller'a
defeal in a serious and dignified tone, al
though with considerable undercurrent of
satisfaction at England's humiliation all
around. It Is admitted that Great Mrit
aln is now righting to save her South
African possessions. The general belief
Is thai sir Redvera Buller acted pre
maturely and under pressure from the
home Government. The papers take â 
rather gloomy view as apprehensive of
awkward complications.
The Kreuz Zeltung says: "Great Rrlt

Whole World."

in the establishment of the United States
of Africa on h republican basis, but It In

would not affect Great Britain's position

tin The trouble began In a saloon
at << Howard street, kept by Jack <>i-.-ii.
and resulted In the arrest of seventeen
men, all <<t whom were Swedish and Rus
sian Finn sailon
The proprietor <>f the p â  .iking
to a woman when a tight started In the
rear of the bouse, where some thirty men
were congregated. Dlsen rushed at the
men and separated them. No sooner had
<>is. n left th.-m. however, than the sail
on again got together and were soon
mixed In a rough and table tight.
Olsen aKain Rot thÂ»- men separated nnd
ordered men to leave his place, which
they refused t.. >\n and the exasperated
proprietor threw the combatant* tnÂ«m
the saloon Into the street.
As s.mri aa th.Â» lighten reached the sHe
waik they forgot their grlevai
each other and turned their attention to
the unfortunate saloon man. Gathering
missiitfi they commenced to throw them
through the windows of the taloon, and
in a moment the entire crowd Joineu
them and with a combined effort pi
ed to demolish the place To make Â»hli si
more serious for Owen some of the men
charged <-n the place from the reir, and
with scantlings, cobble-stones and bricks
managed lo wreck that part of the prem
ises in ji short Spin c of time.
The men were in the act of taking full
possession of the saloon when Officers
Barry and Mullender reach. -.1 the scene
While one of the officers held the front
door the other called for asststanci
the patrol wagon, The men were .*â â¢ busy
wrecking the establishment and righting
among themselves that th.> advent of the
officers surprised them, and they were
easily captured and carted off "in the
wagon, all more or less Injured. On the
way to the Harbor station five of the bel
ligerent sailors were dropped off at the
Harbor Receiving Hospital to have
wound.* dressed!.
In no case did the bruises amount to
much, the most serious being that of
Charles Anderson, who received a deep
gash In his cheek, which was probably
made with a piece Of broken glass.
As nil the men arrested are union sail
ors they refused to charge any one with
having caused their injuries, and conse
quently ;i charge of disturbing the :
was the only one entered. The men re
fuse to give any reason for the trouble
and Olsen thinks that, although the tars
were lighting each other, on seeing their
union brothers put out of the saloon, they
became riotous.

Emeryville Handicap at a
Mile the Feature of the
Racing.
The track of the California Jockey Club
at Oakland will reopen this afternoon for
a two weeks' session of racing, with a
card of exceptional merit. Far from be

a very evenly balanced look, with little
prospvet of there being odds-on choices
to wager .in The principal feature Is
the Emeryville handicap at a mile, with
a big bunch of entries to line up at the
barrier. The track will be muddy, and
there Â»ill. ii. doubt, be several surprises.

WARDE PLAYS
"RICHARD III."
WARDE'B production of "Richard
111 is distinctly disappointing.
Through the years In which he
ha.s played the role he has, per
haps, improved his rendering thereof, but
his conception Is the same, and hence he
Is and always will be the same pool Kleh
ard. He has developed tli. part In his
j'ulnstakinÃ way. but the way is the way
â â ' wardÂ« the pervert perfection of error.
He Is in fault theoretically, and no end of
travail will make the characterisation a
pood one ,m the lines be has laid down
â or himself. His subtlety Is superficial,
If I may use the term, and be frequently
tails a victim to crude devices that are
the essence of atari]
War.!.- is, perhaps, blinded to the enor
mity of his faults through attending too
closely to minor details, yet his care for
the mlnutae is not distinguished by
finesse. it Is as though an artist were
to 1 1 1 .-in 111 1 tO paint a large canvas with
the aid of an Imperfect microscope.
Ward* deliver" Is always extraordinary
and this Is particularly true of him in
Shake.-pear.-an roles. His reading in
"Richard" is rarely Intelligent, and at
times it is simply absurd. His faults of
elocution lie not only In verbal emphasis
that destroys the sense of the text, but In
the mlsvaluatlon of phrases which are
either roared or whispered without regard
for reason.

Trouble of R-questinp Him
10 Cancel His Engagement
for a Time.
R -v. William Rellly. rector of St. Paul's
Episcopal Church on California street,
was not compelled yesterday morning, a*
he had purposed, to nay Home unpleasant
things to the newly engaged organist.
Harry I*. Ulrard, who recently officiated
In a like position In Christ Church. New
York. Mr. Uirard's failure to put In an
appearance, while It may have deprived
the congregation of a musical treat, re
lieved the rector from the dlsagreeablo
task of Informing him that his presence
at St. Paul's would not be. proper until
he had proved the falsity of the Â»tory Ira
circulation that ho wa.i living with an
other man's wife, with whom he hatl
eloped from New York.
(Jlrard was engaged a short time ago n*
organist at St. Paul's, lie had come with.
letter* highly commendatory of hlÂ«i
musical ability. At rehearsals he charmed
every one with hla ability, so that hi*
tlrst appearance at the services was
. agerly awaited. l'j> to Saturday night
nobody, not even tllrard. hud reason to
believe that the new organist would not
officiate yesterday. Ho wan at rehearsal
Saturday evening and hud laid nil hi*
plans for the next day. AftÂ«r the re
hearsal the Rev. Mr. Ilellly learned of
the story In which <'iir.inl and another
man's wife had figured in the Mast. ThÂ»
woman wasâ and maybe is, although
Glrard denies Itâ the wifo of William
Schotleld, cashier of a national bank an<l
secretary of the School Hoard at Port
Chester. N. Y. It was reported that,
while teaching music to Mrs. SchofleM,
Qlrard had gained !>â¢ r affeetilon:* and in
duced her to elope with him.
I'nder the circumstances thero wouM
have been manifest Impropriety In th#Â» ap
pearance, of Mr. Clrard in the church a*
organist. Air. Itellly conceived that to b*Â»
the fact. So .li.l Mr Glrunl. who a.lmif 'â¢â  I
later that he also had heard that thÂ«
story was In circulation concerning him.
He did not go to the church. Hey. Mr.
Rellly breathed more easily, and a scene)
which would have been unpleasant was
avoided Rev. Mr. Itfllly said yesterday
afternoon that lie hail no knowledge of
the antecedents of <Ilmrd when he en
gaged him. The engagement was upon
the basis of recommendations of musical
people, to whom he had applied for an
organist, the plac of organist In thÂ»>
i h irch having become vacant. He h:nl
been pleased with Glrord's. recommenda
tions, and he had been more than pleaseil
With (Jlrard's musical abllltv nnrt hail
congratulated himself upon securing *\ich
ii musical treasure. But now. he nald.
until <;tr:iri| could clear up the story tha
church could not have him play. The or
gan yesterday was played by a member
of the church choir.
Olrard was found at lodgings at CVt
Oeary street. He said that he was mar
ried to the former Mrs. Sehofleld: that
she had secured a divorce In N'ewr York
State after she parted from her husband.
HÂ«* became acquainted with her. he said,
while he was teaching her to sing. If*
denied an allegation that he had left Ww
York secretly, and said that he had re
signed the place of organist there. >Jiw
secrecy. he continued, had marked hfÂ«
movements at any time. Since he ram*
to California he had been puMHhlnc
sonn under his own nan and singing In
public.
"I knew when T married a divorced i.irtV
I was outside the pale In mv own church."
said Â«:ir:ir.l yesterday, "but wo are legal
ly marred. and that Is all there v to thn
story. I could not with propriety gr> to>
St. Paul's Church yesterday. I wa* to
play there only two Pundavs. Then T wm
going to make a dramatic connection.
That Is my present Intention, and I do
not care to do any organ wori at thli
time. Mrs. iilrnrd Is In the housa with
me."

NEW PASTOR FOR
BERKELEY UNITARIANS
Call Extended by the Congregation
to Dr. Hosmer of St.
Louis.
BERKELEY. Pec. 17 -In looking for a
successor for the Rev. O. \V. (Began.
thÂ« trustees of th* First Unitarian
Church, on n.incroft way, favor Rev. Dr.
C. P. Hotmei a divine of national repu
tation, who for many years has filled suc
cessfully the pulpit of one of the Unita
rian churches of St. Louis. Should Dr.
Hosmer feel disposed to come to Califor
nia and Identify himself with the con
gregation of his denomination In the uni
versity town he would prove a valuable
addition to the ministerial force In the
bay cities.
It will not be known for several days
whether I'r. Hosim-r will accept the invi
tation which has been extended to him.
In their correspondence the trustees
J have offered the pulpit to Dr. Hornier for
; a period of six months. At the end of that
I time it is the Intention of the church to
: mako the call a permanent one If both
congregation and minister are willing.
The retiring pastor, the Rev. O. W.
| Geoghegan, whose resignation was ac-
I eepted three weeks ago. will reach his
! farewell st-rmon next Sunday morning.
Early next week he will leave for Baltl-
I more. Maryland. He goes to accept a
! call to the pulpit of the Unitarian Church
1 of that city, and will take his charge im
, mediately upon his arrival.
Hlh Intended successor, aside from his
work as a preacher, has also gained some
distinction as a poet and man of letters.
As one of the advanced thinkers of the
denomination his choice la thought to be
most appropriate for the Unitarian con
gregation nt the university town.

SAYS NATIONS
SHOULD STOP
THE BOER WAR
Oakland Preacher's
Views.
â¦ â
DECLARES IT IS COWARDLY
BELLIGERENTS SHOULD NOT BE
ALLOWED TO FIGHT.
Rev. C. H. Hobart Is of the Opinion
That Some Government Should
Intervene to End the
Trouble
OAKLAND, Dec IT.â Rev. C. H. Hotert,
pastor of the First Baptist <'hiirch. in .1
prelude to his sermon to-night, <lt.Â«' . â  .
briefly the question "Bhouid Â»'liri.-tlan Na
tions Allow the British a 'I Been to Fight
On?' He urges the United States to take
the initiative In the matter of intervening.
He said in part:
"Only bullies or barbarians say let the
fight go on. Civilisation says stop it.
What civilization nays for Individuals it
also says for nations. War Is barbarismâ
war Is hell. Christian nations should cease
to tight and cease to allow others to fight
"It makes me heartsick to think of the
superb men, both Doers and British who
are falling there In South Africa. They
are far too noble to be marched out like
cattle to slaughter because a Chamberlain
or a Kruger wills it sÂ«..
"It is clear that those most responsible
for the war are sick of It. and they ought
to be. Though pride would keep them
from uttering It. they would welcome In
tervention. And It Is time to interfere.
We should have done so ere this. For
men of such magnificent courage to fight
on means simple annihilation. And the
main reason why If) nations do not in
terfore and end the fight la that It would
be an Innovation. Hut why should the
nineteenth century 'â¢** in bondage to the
barbarism and brutality of the past?
"If America and Germany, or America
and Russia, or Russia and Oermany. or
Russia and France would iv this war
must cease and you must settle your dif
ferences on higher planes than brute
force It would cease forthwith. Such a
word ought to be spoken by the powers.
It is cowardly for those who might speak
with potential influence not to do no, and
that promptly."

REV. DR. NIETO DECLARES
THERE iS NO NEED OF KELL
Rev. -Dr. Kioto occupied the pulpit of
the Second Inltarlan Church last night
and delivered an eloquent sermon on the
"Rellgoua rrogress of in., Nineteenth
Century."
He paid a high tribute to Rev. A. J.
Wells, pastor of the church, and then
stated that his Idea of rellgon was correct
conduct. He said but for th.- Israelites of
yore the civilization â¢â¢( to-day would not
have been so ordained. It would have
given place to the "l ! pagan idols which
"made man dust as he was* created." He
then pointed out how the people had
grown 'Hit of mythological Ideas. He sair!
there was no hell and there was no need
of It
"We have abolished hell and put Ihe
devil out of existence," said be. "When
â  man fails he blames himself and hla
own shortsightedness: when he sins he
blames his own weakness What nee.l
then Is there nt I hell? Why should we
have it? Surely we make It for ourselves
on earth. Our own indiscretions, our pride,
our sins, our conceit, lea.l m Into miseries
that hell cannot make worse. What Is
Worse than an outraged conscience, which
keeps one awake nt night? Wo have no
need of hell. Wo don't want any suffer

BIG IMPROVEMENT IN
WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY
PITTSBURO. Dec. 17.â Bold re marches
by Professor Reginald Fessenden md his
assistant. Professor Kltner. In the elec*
trical laboratory of the Western Univer
sity of Pennsylvania have resulted in the
production of a receiver for wireless tele
graphy that Is 2000 times more sensitive
than the so-called "coherer" of the Mar
coni system.
In speaking of â¢ the discovery to-day.
Professor FeÂ«sonf!en said: "Although we
have Improved the receiver so that It is
2000 times as sensitive as the original one,
we realize that we have not ret begun to.
see the limit. Marconi. In his brilliant
experiments, has demonstrated that mes
sage^ cart be r-ont over ninety miles. As
our receiver Is Several hundred times more
sensitive, it Is clear that tlie messages can
bo sent by our met ho 1 very much farther,
thouga just what the limit "is I yould not
like to say. It at least should be possible
to send messages across the Atlantic with
poles less than 2**) feet h.eh. The ultimate
distance must be checked by actual ex
periment before It becomes â  1 'entitle
fact In the strictest sense."
McDnniel Convicted.
PORTLAND. Dec. 17.â Jury In the
case of Frank >aniel. charged with the

CURRENCY BILL
CERTAIN TO PASS
Will Command Every
Republican Vote.
â  c
Special Dispatch to The CalL
WASHINGTON, Dec. 17.â The two
events of importance In the House this
i week before the adjournment for tho
holiday recess on Wednesday will be the
vote on tho currency bill to-morrow Im
mediately after the reading of the journal
and the announcement of the commlt
tees â  n 1 vet lay. I'nder the terms of the
.1 order with the currency bill.
I neither a motion to recommit nor a sub
siitutu proposition is in order, and tho
vote will be taken drectly upon the pas
.-.ifcv of the i ill. The result is a foregone
conclusion, as it will command every Re
publican vote. The interest in the vote
th.-ref.ore lies only In the record of the
Democratic disaffection it will show. The
m Democrats seneralljr, with the
lon of a tÂ»-w li"m New York, are
, not in line with their Democratic brethren
from the South and We^t on the money
tlon. but not all of them will vote for
the l-ill. According to a careful canvass
made l>y Mr. Overstreet of Indiana, who
has thÂ«- bill In charge, it will receive eight
Democratic votes at least, and he believes
ht-\ hti Democrats will dodge. He figures
! that the bill will have v majority of
thirty-five. So far ;u> can be ascertained
DO .iher business will be transacted by
the House this wÂ»-t-k.
NO PROGRAMME IN SENATE.
Indication That the Present â¢ Week
Will Be a Dull One. â 
WASHINGTON. Dee. 17.â The Senate
huM no programme for the present week,
and tho indications are that short dally
sessions will be held and very little busi
ness transacted. Both Houses will ad
journ for the Christmas holidays on
Wednesday. Outside of official nomina- i
tions* there is practically no business on '
the calendar, all important matters In I
committee having been delayed for the re
organization of the committees, effected
at the close of business last week. So far
no notices of speeches on any subject
have been given and Senators generally
express themselves as disposed to post
pone the real business of the session until
after the recess. It is expected that the
financial bill will be received from the
House during the week. It will be re
ftrrtd to the Committee on Finance. This
committee expects to make its report
soon after the resumption of business In
the new year. The real work of the ses
sion will then begin.
FINANCIAL STANDING
OF RUSSIA IS GOOD
Agent of the Ministry Denies Some
Misstatements and Presents
Figures.
WASHINGTON. Dec. 17.-M. Routow
sky. the agent of the Minister of Finance
of Russia in Washington, in a communi
cation to the Associated Press, which has
received the approval of the Russian Em
baâador, complains of the attempts
which ho says wire made In Europe re
cently to creuto In this country the Im
pression that the relations between the
governments of Japan and Russia were
trained.
"Immediately after the statements had
been authoritatively denied by the Rus
sian Embasaador und the Japanese Min
ister here." said M. Routowsky, . "other
sensational rumors were started. pro
sumably at Berlin, and directed against
thÂ« credit of the Russian empire.
These were followed by libels, dl
rected against the eminent statesmen to
whose care was intrusted the credit, and
an appeal made to Japan in an article on
Russian finances to attack that country
before her trans-Siberian railroad could
be completed."
M. i: lutowsky adds that In view of the
fact that all these false rumors and mis
statements, if not exposed, might leave
among capitalists and financiers In this
country an erroneous Impression, he has
decided to give to' the press some figures
on the subject. TheEO figures show that
during the twelve years from ISS7 to
IV?S1 V ?S the ordinary revenues of the Russian
(Jovornmrnt steadily Increased from $20,
(MO/OO roubles in I**7 to 1.9)4,000.000 roubles
in >:â¢*. and that during the whole of that
time, with the exception of two years
<18>7 and lS9b. the expenses were consid
erably less than the receipts, this surplus
for the twelve years amounting to 790.000,
000 roubles. For the same twelve years
the extraordinary revenues and expenses
of the Government make a total of the
former of 1,126,000,000, and of the latter
2.075.000.000.
GERMAN MANUFACTURERS
ARE DISSATISFIED
Claim They Have Been Unfairly Dis
criminated Against In the Mat
ter of Tariff.
BERLIN, Dec. 17.â At a meeting of the
Cologne- Manufacturers' Association yes
terday Manager Steller reported upon the
recent Philadelplha conference, greatly
belllttling its importance. He advised
against the appointment of an Interna
tional committee to Investigate the tariff
disagreement between Germany and the
United Slates and paid:
"Such tender considerations for the
Americans is misplaced. Only a self
assertive attitude, on the part of Ger
man nation can impress American public
opinion. We must make the Americans
realize that we can dispense with them If
necessary and we must demand that Ger
many be treated upon a footing of decent,
reasonable reciprocity."
The Hamburg Boersehhalle advises con
ciliatory measure* advocating a reduction
In the duty on maize and a leas severÂ© In
spection of American commodities. It
claims, however, that the American treat
ment of Germany In tariff administration
is unfair.

BIG ADVANCE IN
FREIGHT RATES
Shippers May Appeal to
the Courts.
Special Dispatch to The CWI.
CHICAGO. Dec. 17â The Chronicle to
morrow will say: One of the most radi
cal and general advances ever made in
freight rates will go Into effect on all the
railroads east and west of Chicago Janu
ary 1. Thousands of articles of every-day
consumption will be affected, and the in
creasÂ© will average 36 and 40 per cent, the
Jump on many classes reaching 50 per
cent. The contemplated action has
aroused the snipping interests uf the
country. The shippers say that If the
carrying charges are increased to the ex
tent announced by the railroads it will
have the effect of increasing retail prices
In every line of trade.
Sugar, soap, coffee, flour, coal and farm
implements are a few of the articles to be
affected. Of these, as well as on hundreds
of other articles, the increase will run
from 2) to HO per cent. The rate on coal,
for example, west of Chicago will bfl
pushed up to 25 cents on the Eon. Kates
on cattle will be advanced to 2S cents per
100 pounds and hogs and sheep will Â«o up
from 25 cents to 80 rents and dressed ]
meats to 40 cents per 100 pounds. Hay \*
another article that will feel the advance
severely. The tariff on this will be in
creased $1 10 per ton.
Chicago shippers are circulating peti
tions asking the railroads to defer thfl ad
vances until April 1 to enable them to
catch up on their orders. Should the rall
roadl refuse, disastrous results to manu
facturers and wholesaler! win. it is
claimed, bo the consequence. Shippers in j
several jobbing centers talk of appealing
to the Judiciary.
Officers of the railroads declare that the
advances are made necessary by tho in
cr.-ased cost of everything they are com- '
Delled to buy from ties to engines. They
further aver that there is no reason why
thÂ»Â» railroads should continue quoting
panic rates while merchants, manufac
turers and others arÂ»Â» advancing rates.

â¢ I^ng threatened highbinder troubles in
Chinatown resulted yesterday in murder.
Wong Char.g Gom, a taller, was shot and
fatally wounded about 9 o'clock in the
morning on tho stairway of the Sullivan
building at 1027 Dupont street. He was
found by Officer Knight and sent to the
Receiving Hospital, where he died on the
operating table. An examination of Wong
Chang Gom's body revealed three wounds,
either of which would have proven fatal.
One bullet entered the chin close to the
lower Up and plowed Its way upward and
lodged in the brain. Another passed en
tirely through his body, while a third
took effect in the left Kg.
The police immediately started to inves
tigate tne murder, but have not as yet
located the party or parties who fired the
rhots. While searching for a clew Officer
Callahan found two murderous-looking
revolvers In a refuse barrel at the head
if the stairway where the shooting oc
curred. Two chambers In one of the
weapons wore found empty, and one
chamber In the. other was tound In a like
condition. Detective, I'd Gibson was de
tailed on the case by Captain Hi. hen.
Wong Chang Corn's timely death is
ettrlbutcM to labor troubles in the Celes
tial quarter. He was a tailor employed
by Wing & Co. at CIS Commercial street.
The lirra was under the ban of the Tailors'
I'nion for not abiding by its laws, and its
employes were warned that death would
be deult out to them if they did not quit
work. The members of the Chinese Tai
lors' Union nf said to belong to tho See
I Yup Society, which had Bet a price on the
I head t;t the murdered man. and a like
I amount has been placed on that of Dong
I Wing, proprietor of the shop, and the
| other men employed by him.
There were no witnesses to thÂ«Â» shooting.
i but it Is presumed by the police that
â  Wong Chang Gom ha<l left his room on
the top floor of the Sullivan building for
the purpose of getting his breakfast, and
had just reached the second landing of
| the dark hallway when- his foes, who lay
I In wait for him. shot him down.
The police have long looked for an out
; br<-ak In Chinatown because of the trouble
; between the union and non-union tailors.
| Shootings have taken place in San Jose
i and other coast cities. The police have
I been instructed to keep a sharp lookout
! and arrest all suspicious characters.
Wong Chung Gom's body was removed
to the Morgue. He was a member of the
j Yurg Wah Company. His father Is said
to reside in the southern portion of the

Mayor Phelan. F. W. Dohrmann and
F. H. Gould Contest With Max
Popper. J. H. Barry and
J. H. Marble.
A public debate on the question of rh*
propn | i). -id yesterday
"i at &laei nerbund Hall. Twenty
fourth "-tn^t and ii j f.Tr.-ro avenue, rae
meeting, which was under the auspices
of the Mission and Potroro Improvement
Club, was largely attended. In calling
the meeting to order Chairman T. B.
Slevln stated that there would b^ no de
declslon rendered, hut that the exponents
of both sides would simply advance their
arguments for and against the question-
He then Introduced Frank H. Gould, tha
first speaker for the amrmative. After
pointing cut the great possibilities of
San Francisco Mr. Gould said:
"The plain proposition before us Is
whether we propose, for a reasonable
amount, to beautify this city and make It
second to none in the world. Better re
sults can be obtained by a municipal In
debtedness than by a 'pay-as-you-go'
policy. Every cltlxen should vote In favor
of the bond elections because San Fran
cisco needs proper schoolhousts to edu
cate its children; it needs sewers to re
move the stigma resting on the city be
cause of its ana mitary condition and to
reduce the death rate. To erect a hospital
for the sick is .ty."
At this i .uld was Interrupted
by the chairman, who Bald his time was

th " PUbll< s of schools, sewers
and hosnltals. He said:
"The argument that paving of streets
is more Important than the acquisition
of the panhaj.dle will be settled when tne
i of Public Works, to be appoint
ed by the Mayor, will inaugurate a >j s
t<m that will benefit each district of the
clty. The chars;* that it would be impossi
ble to suddenly get the necessary numuer
of laborers to do the work is ;iot true, be
cause the work of acquiring the property
will bo gradual and take years, during
whl< h the â¢ Ity will derive a. .aige income

W h. n Max Popper began his argument
â  ityor Phelan en-
Lhe hall ajj'J was given three rousing
by l'ui'per. in his speech
Mr. Popper said:
â¢1 claim that it is unjust to assess the
outside landholder for parks that are so

that the panhandle can be

prophets know this? The owner
may ank to submit the sale of his prop
erly to arbitration and in other ways the
COS! n ..siderably increased. It is
said that per cent of the owners are in
of the panhandle, but It is because
they have been liberally treated In the

or Phelan'a argument was devoted
t' the ornamental and healthful n^iilt*
to be obtained by the panhandle, and the
Increased value in the property acquired.
"Th s is not â  local matter," said he;
rtion in the ' Ity has a direct in

them out of the hospitals. Parks are the
of the city, besides giving us

something for the pleasure and <:omfiÂ»rt

in time.
"The buying up of the property for pan
handle purposes Is a good investment, as
evidenced by other cities. Central Park.
New York. o..st $8,000,000, and is worth
benefits the whole community by bringing
happiness and health to its members.'
James H. Barry was the last speaker,
and, referring to a witticism of the Mayor
that a "pair 1 was no yviod without a
"handle," "Hut wÂ«_- don't want an
unwieldy handle one mile and a half tons.
They say that the panhandle would beau
tify the city, but it can be beautified In
other and better ways. It is not right to

â¢â¢The project will bring many unem
; 1 b< re, as did the Midwinter Fair.
Do not be misled. Vote for schools, sewers
and hospital, but do not vote for the
panhandle.
Mayor i'helan closed the debate by
stating that the reason the elections were
being held this month is that the charter
contains no provision rÂ» carding the pur
chase <>f land for public timed
that at Hi" end "f twenty y>ars tti- city

concluded by urging his hearers t>> direct
their energies '" Qm prugresslTe move
ment that is destined to result in a new
San Francisco.
At the meeting of the Socialists in
Union-square Hal] last evening Charles
Glldea spoke on the subject of bonds for
the park extension and other municipal
improvements. He i tared the city bad
been long enough under the rule of the
Silurians. He believed the bond issues
would bo of Inestimable benefit, for under
the improvements they would make pos
sible real estate values would rii and
the city would be much more prosperous
generally. lie called attention to all the
land the city has given away and how
little it has kept for Itself, and how evi
dent is the mistake it has made by such
a course. He exhorted his hearers to
vote for the bond issues for all municipal
improvements. .
At the meeting of the Ocean View Im
provement Club the following resolution
was adopted:
"We. the members of thÂ© Ocean View
Improvement Club, pledge ourselves to
work and vote for the bonds for schools,
sewers and the nark panhandle."
John Mclaughlin. John Lewis, T. John
son, I*, Peei im. J. Hunter. James Far
rell, Lem Hale and J. J. Sullivan were ap
pointed to form a campaign committee.
The club also passed a unanimous vote
favoring the municipal ownership of the

j of the Jaw. inflicting a flesh wound that
is not regarded as serious. Mrs. Josephs,
the woman who was entertaining Ford at
the time of the shooting, is detained at
the City Prison as a witness.
The affair is Involved In considerable
mystery, and Detective Charles Cody,
who was detailed by Captain Bohen on
the case, has thus far been unable to dis
cover a tangible clew to the Identity of
the shooter. He is satisfied , however,
that ForJ knows the man who snot him.
and there Is a strong suspicion that Mrs.
j Josephs could tell his name if she felt so
; Inclined. She admits that Ford probably
knows the name of his asailant.

street, and Mrs. Henrietta LJedma.i. who

LANE'S OPINION READY.
Telephone License Ordinance to Be
Considered by Supervi ors.
City and County Attorney Lane has so
far recovered from his sudden Illness that
he will to-day present to the Board of Su
pervisors his opinion upon the telephone
license resolutions. What will be the
text of his communication Mr. Lane de
clines to say. Because of the confident
boasts of the agents of the monopoly It
was feared for a time that they had final
ly so arranged matters that the telephone
resolutions would either be declared bad
law or would escape enactment because
of the time limit.
Mr. Lane's sudden Illness at such a
critical time enhanced the worry of those
members of the board who were Instru
mental in Introducing the resolution, as It
was feared he would not recover In time
to submit the necessary opinions. Yester
day, however, he announced that they
would be forthcoming this afternoon.
