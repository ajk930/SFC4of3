PERRY STATUE, CLEVELAND, OHIO.
During the disturbances attending the strike of street car employes at Cleveland there have been some se
rious riots in the vicinity of the statue. . ....'.. . ;
CLEVELAND, 0., July 25.â Rioting !
was renewed to-night, and in one
encounter a detachment of militia
charged with bayonets and dis- j
persed the rioters. '
Strikers and their friends to-night !
held a meeting and various speakers
protested against the presence of troop's
and the carrying of: arms by the non
union street car employes. ' s
A- State law exists which declares
that a defendant arrested for carrying \
â weapons, upon proving that he believed
his life, liberty or property endangered I

rested oh this charge have been dis
charged under the act refered to.
Rain fell during most of the after- \
â¢ noon and did what the police have been ;
unable to â keep crowds from collect- j
Ing and molesting cars. Eleven of the
fourteen lines of the Big Consolidated ;
Streets were in operation before 7
o'clock to-day. The three lines on
which cars were not started were the
Union, Barton and Clark-avenue |
routes.
Adjutant General Axline, in command
of # the military here, approximates the
force under him at twenty companies,
aggregating nearly 1200 men. Four
hundred of them, from Columbus, New
ark and Chillicothe,' arrived this after
noon and were distributed about the
city at points where trouble is feared.
Mayor Farley, General Axline. Police
Director Barrett and Assistant-Corpo
ration Councel Excel! had a long con
ference over the situation y)-day. The
result was that a large guard of sol
diers was to-night sent to South Brook
lyn, where the Mayor believes the dis
turbing element to be strongest.
With the coming of darkness to-day,
small riots, mostly in the foreign in
habited parts of the city, made their
appearance, and conflicts in which no
body was seriously hurt, took place be
tween the soldiers and police on one
side and strikers and their sympathiz
ers on the other. On Broadway the
cars, loaded with guards anjl a few
passengers, traveled in pairs, and at
Clay and Pearl streets a mob of about
2000 men and boys, with a sprinkling of
women, gathered and, when they could
elude the soldiers, stoned the cars and
the crews. Conflicts were frequent and
a number of arrests, were made. : .
At 10 o'clock a detachment of militia
charged with bayonets and dispersed
the rioters.. W; ; ;.;f >;-;:.-'/ â¢> ;_(Â£'Â£'Â£>
There -were a few incipient riots in
South Brooklyn by midnight, but the
guards bad 'the situation well in hand.

of South - Brooklyn, where sentiment
seems to be \ largely pro-striker, dug
from his musty tombs an ancient law
which declares that In case of riots.

being more â¢ particularly in danger in
that section- than in any other part of

Mayor Farley late to-night issued : a
proclamation, calling upon the citizens
to act calmly during the excitement of
i the strike and remain off the streets as
much as possible. .'-.*
Auton.Musil, mingling with a mob t on

; by soldiers and received three bayonet
wounds in the head. Musil shut the
j door of his place, but his- pursuers

BISHOP HORSTMANN'S
PLEA TO THE PEOPLE
CLEVELAND, July 25.â The citizens
of Cleveland, among whom the street
j car strike is the chief topic of conver
sation, to-day added their comments to
j *he address issued by the Right Rev.
; Ignatius. F. Horstmann, Bishop of the
j diocese of Cleveland. The utterances,
; of the Catholic divine, a man of great
j Influence among the people of his de
| nomination throughout Ohio, are re
â¢ garded .as vividly expressive of the sit
i uation here, and it is expected his mes
sage pleading the law will be observed
and. the civic dignity upheld will re
sult in the subduing of much of the
violence which has made the past week
an epoch in local history. The address
follows:

LONG shot and killed 25â E. V.
Methever, a shoe dealer of this
city, shot and killed Miss Doro
| j thy McKee at an early hour this
morning. The murder was care
fully planned, Methever meeting the
young woman and a friend while they
were cycling, and firing three bullets
into her body. Then he turned the
weapon upon himself, inflicting an ugly
wound in the head, but which is not
likely to prove fatal. The crime
aroused the community, and it ,was
found necessary to take Methever to
Los Angeles to prevent a possible
lynching.
Methever owns a shoe store at the
upper end- of the main street. Half of
the building has been occupied by S. E.
McKee and his wife and daughter.
Thrown together in this way, a friend
ship sprang up between Methever and
the McKees, and of late Methever has
been attentive to Miss Dorothy. He
taught her to ride a â¢ bicycle and in
many ways evinced a decided prefer,
ence for her society. He was known
to be a married man, his wife living in
San Miguel, and as he was some thirty
years older than the girl, it was sup
posed he entertained no warmer feeling
for her than friendship. So far as can
now be learned, he never intimated to
her that she. had awakened his love,
but friends can now remember many
signs which tend to prove that he had
been passionately devoted to her for
some time. *'. ,-
A few weeks ago Miss McKee became
acquainted with I. Baker, one of the
young men about town, and the two
soon became warm friends. Last night
they went for, a bicycle ride on the
beach, accompanied by , a visiting
friend, Mrs. Scudder of Los Angeles.
The party were t put some time and on
returning to th? house took lunch to
gether. Methevef's room was so neat
that he could easily hear their merry
making, and it is supposed that it
fanned his jealousy into a flame.
This morning the two ladies arose
early and went for another ride on the
beach. After wheeling about a mile
west from the main wharf they started
to return, and found Methever ap
proaching on his wheel. They ap
proached him without a thought of
fear. He did not say a word, but de
liberately ran into the wheel upon
which Miss Dorothy was riding. As
I she dismounted in surprise at his ac-
I tion, he drew a revolver and fired three,
shots at close range, all of them taking
I effect. One passed through the head
| and two through the body, causing al
i most instant death. He then turned
! the -weapon upon himself, the ball en
! tering in front of the right ear and
i coming out at the eye. A citizen named
Hawthorne happened to be near and
disarmed him, but he drew a second
revolver and attempted to make sure
of his work. He fell unconscious be
fore he could fire tbe second shot.
All this was done without Methever
or the women having. spoken a word
and with a calmness and deliberation
on the part of the man which showed
that the tragedy had been carefully
planned. All passed so quickly that
! Mrs. Scudder hardly realized what was
occurring until she saw her friend fall.
; Her screams soon brought a crowd to
| the scene.
The body of the girl was tenderly
I cared for, while her murderer was
I dumped down in the harness room of a
! livery stable â¢to recover consciousness
!at his leisure. An examination made
j later developed the fact that his wound
j was not dangerous and his physicians
hope to have him ready for a speedy
trial. *â¢.";â â ;,â  â,
Feeling ran so high here this after,
noon when it was learned that Meth
ever would recover that it was deemed
best to take him to Los Angeles for
safe keeping.- If he had not been such
a pitiful sight, with his facetoftn by
j the bullet, the crowd never would have
; allowed him to be brought from the
i beach.
Miss McKee was'a modest and unas
' suming girl of more than the usual
charms of person and manner, and was
very popular among the young- people
of the place. ";'.",';;V,; :. :JA

CANADA INSISTS ON A
PORT ON LYNN CANAL
Backed by Great Britain, the Dominion Gov
ernment Clamors for Arbitration of the
Boundary Dispute.
OTTAWA, Ont., July What ls
now suggested as a basis of set
tlement of the Alaska boundary
difficultiesâ cession to Canada of
a free port on Lynn Canal â
would probably prove acceptable to
the Dominion Government.
While.the boundary question was
before the joint high commission in
Washington the negotiations narrowed
down to this very proposition, which
was at first accepted by the American
Commissioners, but subsequently they
refused to agree to it, and pourparlers
were not resumed on those lines.
"While we have every faith in the
justice of Canada's contention," said
my informant, a high authority, "we
must not expect to obtain a full meas
ure of our rights, any more than we
could possibly acquiesce in the extreme
claims of our neighbors. We are assur-

This would give the Dominion Government a free port on Lynn Canal, leading to the Yukon country.
Ed that a correct delimitation of \ the
boundary under the terms of the Rus
sian treaty of 1825 would establish the
line miles outside of the head of tide
water on Lynn Canal. We have always
been prepared to compromise on any
basis which will give us a port there.
"What we object to is an arrange
ment which would shut us off from
communication with the interior, mak
ing our Yukon possessions .a veritable
hinterland. â¢ Short of â  possessions for
commercial purposes of a port on Lynn
Canal, from which there is already part
communication by rail to the head of
Yukon navigation, Canada cannot be
expected to accede to a relinquishment
of her claim. It will be either that or
a reference- to arbitration. Any fair
arbitration will suit us."
LONDON, July 26.â The Daily Mail
this morning, in a rather strong editor
ial on the Alaskan boundary, dispute,
contends that the interpretation of the
treaty is pre-eminently a matter for ar
bitration. ...â¢ " _ : V. 'J/- 1 -''- *
"Yet," says the Daily Mail, "the
United States declines to arbitrate sim
ply because the political pressure from
the Pacific Coast States is so strong
that the President fears that his re-elec
tion might be endangered if he took the
just course. We would hot be misun
derstood. Canada asks no concessions,
but only for what she considers her
own by right, and she is so confident
of her case' that she Is ready to go be
fore any international tribunal. Recip
rocal concessions are talked of. but
why should Canada pay a high price
for what seems to be her own.
"Whenever the United States has pro
posed arbitration of any dispute Eng
land has invariably acceded. Why
should the United States to-day hang
back unless they think that their case
is weak? The United States has the
reputation of being hard bargainers.
That is all very well, and we have often
made concessions to them simply be
cause we did not desire to quarrel over
trifles, but here the vital interests of
Canada are concerned and it must be
clearly understood that we cannot sac
rifice Canada. We want justice and an
open. port or two if not justice."
LYNN CANAL THE
BONE OF CONTENTION
WASHINGTON, July ? 25.â At the
meeting of \ the Cabinet, to-day there

Secretary Hay explained the status

ress ' between himself and . Mr. Tower,

lem would be solved by direct negotia
tion. Great Britain now seems willing
to consider the proposal of the United
States to give Canada the privilege of
a port of entry into the Dominion, while*
retaining absolute sovereignty over the
Lynn Canal, and it is around this sort
of a proposition that the hope of a set
tlement now hovers. ; - â  ';' .-â¢
The speeches of Sir Wilfrid Laurier
and Sir- Charles Tupper came up inci
dentally, but no serious attention was
given them. The settlement by direct
negotiation will be the easiest as well
as the most satisfactory method of dis
posing of this troublesome question and
such a settlement, from the facts de
veloped at to-day's Cabinet meeting, is
regarded as by no means out of the
realm of probability. V; /
DEMANDS OF CANADA
ARE MOST UNREASONABLE
The United States Will Not Give Up
Lynn Canal and the Coveted
â  Ports.
WASHINGTON, July 25.â The Alaskan
boundary question has reached a more
critical stage than at any previous time
in its history.
The Canadian Government has trumped
up and put forward the most absurd
claims and insists that the United' States
shall agree to submit the whole question
to arbitration and in any event give her
a free port on Lynn Canal, leading to the
Yukon country. _â¢,]-!>":;
Pyramid Harbor, commanding the Por
â¢cupine district, and the Dalton trail, over
Chilcoot Pass, is the port designated.
Speaking before the Canadian Parlia- '
ment in behalf of the Government, Sir
Wilfrid Laurier. the Premier, has de
clared that the United States must either
fight or agree to submit to arbitration the |
question of her ownership of territory |
over which she, with Russia before her,
has had sole and until quite recently un- >
disputed possession and jurisdiction for
three-quarters of a century. -
The boundary line claimed by our
Government is the same that has been |
given by every cartographer, English,- |
European and American, from 1825 â¢on
down until the discovery of the rich gold
deposits in the valley of the Yukon made
the control of some or all of the sea
port approaches thereto a matter of para
mount importance to Canada.
To secure this control Canada is insist
ing upon an interpretation of the meaning
of the treaties defining the boundary lines I
that will give her possession of Whites. j
Chilcoot and Chllcat passes, with Skag
uay, Dyea, Pyramid Harbor and other
ports leading thereto; also the lately dis
covered Porcupine gold field, and shutting
the -United States out entirely from tne
waters of the Lynn Canal, and that we
abandon our present impregnable position
and submit the whole question, with some
others not directly connected therewith,
to the uncertainty of arbitration before a
tribunal which would undoubtedly be
composed of Europeans naturally more or.
less disinclined to favor American inter
ests. This demand is not made with any
definite expectation that her claims wnl
find any real merit before the court, but
that by insistent contention she may, se
cure a compromise that will give her con
trol of one or more of the ports desired.
But to guard against any possible miscar
riage of her plans in case the court should
decide the boundary question on its well
understood merits and adversely to her,
she wants to bind the United States be
forehand that, no matter what the results
of tbe arbitration may be. Pyramid Har
bor is to be given over to her.
Secretary Hays' emphatic refutation of
this proposal was the cause of Premier
Laurier's belligerent utterance*. How
ever, the astute and practical diplomats
of Grsat Britain may get the better of us
in the end, it is very certain that such
an attitude on the part of- the Canadian
Government will not tend to promote a
spirit of concession on our 'part. ,
The United States acquired and holds
title to Alaska by the treaty of cession
from Russia, â¢â  made March 30, 1567, in
which the limits and boundaries of the
territory ceded were given in the exact'
words and . terms of the Anglo-Russian
treaty of 1825. by which | the boundaries
between the Russian possessions in the
northwestern, part of this Continent,
known as Russian America, and the
British possessions adjoining them, were,
set forth and defined. The whole ques
tion hinges on the interpretation of the
meaning of the 'language of that part of
the treaty which relates to the boundary
along the southeastern part or panhandle
of Alaska, which is as follows: â :â  "Com
mencing, from, the southernmost point of
the island called Prince of Wales Island,
which point lies in | the parallel of 54 de
grees 40 minutes north latitude, and be
tween the 131 st and 133 d degrees of west
longitude, Greenwich' meridian, the said
line shall ascend to the north along the
channel called Portland Canal as far* as
the point of the continent where it strikes
the 56th degree of north latitude. From
this last-mentioned point the; line of de
marcation shall follow the summit of the
mountains situated parallel to the coast
as far as the. point of Intersection of the â¢
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
141 st degree of west longitude (of thÂ©
same meridian, Greenwich), and finally
from the said point of intersection the
said meridian of the 141 st degree in Its
prolongation to the frozen ocean.
"With reference to the line of demarca
tion as laid down in the preceding article
it is understood:
"Firstâ That the island called Prince of
Wales Island shall belong wholly to
Russia, (now by this cession to the United
States). -;.-.â â¢; -. 'â¢.-.--
"Second â That whenever the summit of
the mountains, which extend in a direc
tion parallel to the coast from the 55th de
gree of north latitude to tbe point of In
tersection of the 141 st degree of west lon
gitude, shall prove to be more than ten
marine leagues from the ocean, the limit
between the British possessions and the
line of coast which is to belong to Russia,
as above mentioned (that Is to say the
limit to the possessions as ceded by this
convention) shall be formed by a line
parallel to the winding of the coast and
which shall never exceed the distance 6E
ten marine leagues therefrom (west
limit").
From 1525, the date of the Anglo-Russian
treaty,, until the discovery of gold in the
Yukon Valley in the 'SO's, no attempt was
ever made on the part of either Great
Britain or Canada to call into question the
interpretation put upon the meaning of
the language of the treaty as given above
by every map maker and geographical
authority on either side of the Atlantic,
who have invariably drawn the line at
not more than ten marine leagues from
shore, where the salt water of the ocean
washes the continent. *V- â /'-"â 
Lately, however, the Canadians have
insisted upon and shown upon their offi
cial maps the boundary line as running
ten marine leagues from the outer edge
of the chain of Islands skirting the coast.
This contention, if admitted, will shut the
United States entirely out of Lynn Canal
and give Canada all the ports thereon
leading to the Yukon country.
PINES SAYS THE STRIKE
IS NOT A FAILURE
NEW YORK, July 25.â District Mas
ter Workman James Pines of District
Assembly No. 75, Knights of Labor
leader in the Brooklyn street car strike,
issued the following statement to-day:
This strike was forced upon the men by
the president of the Brooklyn Rapid
Transit Company. It will be continued
for the reason that it, has the sympathy
of ! all the labor organizations, not . only
in Now York, but in the entire countrj.
The unions in .'Greater New York have
shown their sympathy and \ support by
their willingness to contribute to those
who were compelled to sacrifice th.m
selves for their fellow , creatures. It
matters not who the . men are who
will man the cars ln Brooklyn here
after, they must receive the benefit
of this - effort and therefore will bo
much. easier to organize than were those
who have been driven out. In their home
and alone they will be shown the benefit
they have received by the sacrifices of
those who. had sufficient courage to in
sist unon their rights. :;â  ;-. ."-V'-V* 1 '
The injustice of the number of hours
they are compelled to work each day is
so thoroughly advertised that neither the
Governor nor the Mayor can longer sit
idly by and not recognize the justice of
the men's claim, and the people who own
these railroads must see that if the mod
est request of the men had been granted
It would have been a thousand times les_
expensive to the corporation than the
thing they have forced upon themselves-:.
As evidence of this I point to the Coney
Island and Brooklyn Railroad, which was
run without interruption through two
strikes. I mention this to show that la
boring men are not unreasonable, and only
ask for fair treatment, and when fair
treatment is given those Riving it reap
the reward. -I will do always whatever
is In my power to assist the men who
have been courageous enough to sacrifice
themselves for their fellow employes, and
no one can make me believe but that the
fellow employes who have received the
benefits will forever remember those who
made such sacrifices.
The newspapers can claim the strike
to be a failure, but no argument that they
or any one else can use will satisfy tne
that this strike has been anything but
a victory for the men as the future will
prove.
In justice to Albert Johnson and the
public I want to say this: "Mr. Johnson
was, opposed to this strike. He reasoned
with them and pointed out to them why
they could not win and he advised thÂ«m
to go to the Mayor and told them that
if the Mayor would act he could set
tle the -matter in one hour without a
strike. He also said to me that he had
no motive other than a friendly feeling
for the men who helped him to make his
money and I am convinced that it is the
truth."

CAT. I; HEADQUARTERS. WELLING
TON HOTEL, WASHINGTON, July 25.â
The naval board of bureau chiefs, to-day
ended a controversy which has been pend
ing for some time in regard to the changes
in designs of. the new battleship Maine
and her sister ships, the Missouri and the
Ohio, by deciding to reduce the thickness
of armor from twelve to eleven inches.
This action was taken upon the recom
mendation of Messrs. Cramps, who sug
gested the change as the best means of
giving the battleship Maine, building by
that firm, the required speed and stability
made necessary by alterations in the
original design. The action of the board
of construction does not mean that there
was a mistake made in the original plans
which the board has been compelled to
correct. .
â¢Despite the published statement to that
effect, there has never been any question
as to the stability of the Maine on the
original designs. All calculations of the
Cramps and the Navy Department indi
cate that her stability will be perfect.
The original plans of the Navy Depart r
ment for the Maine and her Bister ships,
the Ohio and Missouri, provided. for six
ARGUMENTS IN THE
CORCORAN CASE
Robertson's Strong Plea
for His Client.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WALLACE, Idaho, July 25.â Attorney
Robertson, for the defense, arguing the
Corcoran case this morning, devoted his
attention principally to the attacking
of the Bunker Hill and other mining
companies, arguing that ; they, rather
than the State, are prosecuting Cor
coran. He took up the evidence of each
witness,, especially attacking that of
the Bunker Hill employes or persons
in any way dependent. Upon that com
pany.
Mr. Robertson spoke for over four
hours in defense of Paul Corcoran, re
viewing the. testimony, of each impor
tant witness. He closed with an appeal
to the. jury, to consider the' condition of
Corcoran's children and the wife soon 1 to
be again a mother, and if possible to
save them from the disgrace which con
viction would mean. He spoke longer
than he had intended, owing to the ill
ness of Counsel Reddy, who "was to fol
low. It is expected" that Mr. Reddy
will be able to speak to-morrow.
John" C. Bell, W. D. Ratchford- and
J. ,T. Kennedy, sub-committee of the
Congressional Industrial Committee,
arrived here last night to examine into
the Coeur d'Alene mining troubles.
They came over the Missoula cut
off, having stopped at Butte on the
way from Denver. - Th' 3 sub-commit
tee,, under arrangements made by the
full committee in dividing the work,
looks after the industrial disturbances
among miners particularly.
They came West to look into difficul
ties between the Colorado smelters and
employes, continuing on here at the
instance of Edward Boyce, president of
the Western Federation of miners, Sen
ator Heitfeld and others. To-day was
spent quietly by the commission in ac
quainting 1 themselves with the local
situation. The length of their stay is
uncertain, but they will be here long
enough to become familiar with- the
causes leading to the strike at Wardner
and the subsequent riot, which involved
-the whole Coeur d'Alenes. The informa
tion they secure will be the basis of a
report to Congress at the next session.
OREGONIANS OBJECT
TO FORM OF DISCHARGE
Through Some Oversight the Word
â¢â Honorable" Has Been Omitted
From Blanks. 'â¢-' - : \
WASHINGTON, July 25.â The members
of the Second Oregon Regiment at San
Francisco have objected to. the form of
discharge because it does not contain the
; word "honorable." It is said at the War
Department that there are three forms of
discharge â "honorable," "without honor"
and "dishonorable."
If none of the words is used the dis
charge is considered in law and by the
War Department as honorable. It seems
that in the blanks used the word "honor
able" has been left out, but there is no
objection to having It written in if the
men desire. â __ vf- . t '

teen knots' speed., with a draught of 23
feet 6 inches. The Navy Department was
very anxious that the three vessels should
not draw more than that amount of water,
in order that they might be able to enter
every lmpora*nt port on the Atlantic coast.
After the contract had been awarded it
was decided by the department that ves
sels of greater speed were more desirable,
and the plans were changed with the con
sent of the contractors, so as to insure a
speed of eighteen knots, to provide for
additional machinery and for more coal,
and the plans call for an increase in the
length of each battleship. Since then the
Cramps have been working out a distribu
tion of weights in order to ascertain
whether the vessels would have a draught
of more than 23 feet 6 inches under the
new designs.
The department has, in addition to pro
viding that the vessels should be longer,
changed the caliber of the big guns from
thirteen to twelve inches, in order fo re
duce the weight. The Cramps are cer
tain, however, that this reduction in the
size of the guns and lengthening of the
ships would give them a draught of 23
feet fi inches or less, but in fact would
make them draw 5C inches more, or 23
feel I 1l 2 inches of water. The board on
Construction to-day adopted the sugges
tion of the Cramps practically as. sub
mitted, the only changes being that the
armor should be thicker in some places

was,, arrested to-day by Inspector of Po
lice W. H. Medley "of Fall River upon a
requisition and warrant granted by Gov

Gwynn was arrested by Sheriff Stewart
at Los Olivos, where his parents reside.
Gwynn managed to give $2000 ball, but
with his bride fled in a buggy across the
mountains from Santa Maria to this city,
arriving yesterday. He was to-day pre
paring -to journey further, but the officers
stopped him at the Arcade depot. The
couple had used the name of J. K. Ham
mond during their travels.
- Officer Medley, who to-night left for the
East with Gwynn, Bays that the parents
â¢seek to recover their daughter to save her
from further trouble and to give her every
attention. Attorney M. G. B. Swift of

as an adviser for the girl and to settle
the legal points, that the extradition of
Gwynn would become a certainty. â "*,"'>,
YELLOW FEVER SCARES
CANAL COMMISSIONERS
Chief Engineer Bogue Declines to Go

WASHINGTON, July. 25. â Yellow
fever has scared off the survey party
connected with the Isthmian Canal
Commission, which had expected to
leave New York early next month to
make a survey of the Panama .route.
Virgil Bogue, who was to be chief
engineer, of this party, has, it is under
stood, declined to go at this season on
account of the danger to his party from
yellow fever on the isthmus, and it is
now doubtful whether this party will
start before September or October.
Under Francis Lee Stuart, assistant
engineer, an advance party of sixteen
men has already left for Greytown for
duty in connection with the Nicaraguan
route. Imbrie Miller, as chief engineer,
is to have charge of this party, which
will comprise altogether about forty
men. He has arranged to start with
the rest of his party on August 5.
The sub-commission of which Rear
Admiral Walker is president, appointed
to make personal inspection of the
Panama canal records, will meet in
Paris at the Continental Hotel, August

that certain errors had been discovered in ',
the construction of the battleship Maine, ;
now being built by the Cramps.
The contracts for the Ohio, npw in !

would exist in the Ohio.
Henry T. Scott of the Union Iron Works
was seen yesterday- and interviewed on
this matter.
"I think the 'Ohio will be alUthat'was
expected/ he said. "At present just the
frame is built. In our plans we followed
the Government design with the exception
of a superior length of twenty feet. The
ships were designed for sixteen knots, but
the cry is for faster ships, and we guar

are of the Russian pattern and differ, from I
those we prepared. No, I do not think
there will be any fault or defect in the :

WASHINGTON, July 25â The
Cabinet at its meeting to-day
considered an appeal from Fort
Wrangle, Alaska, for help for
forty destitute miners arriving
there over the Edmonton trail.
The Government advices re

were to follow. While there is
no specific appropriation that
will cover the case* the result of
the decision is that means will be

The Coast and Geodetic Survey has
received a report from. G. "R. Put
nam, who is out with a party at
St. Michael, regarding . the recently
opened gold fields around Cape Nome.
Mr. Putnam says he cannot vouch
for the accuracy' of the floating reports
from Cape Nome. It is certain new fields
have been opened from five to thirty miles
back from the coast between Cape Nome
and Cape Rodney. There are about 2090
miners in that section, with their prin
cipal settlement at Anvil City, a new
town not yet on any map except those of
the transportation companies. One of the
reports speaks of $10,000 having been taken
out of an area twenty-five feet square
within a foot of the moss roots. This,
however, is not vouched for by Mr. Put
nam.. 'â -. â¢
The survey has no very recent reports
from the more Inland regions, but it is
understood that the American miners who
were driven out of the Atlin district and
went over to the Porcupine country have
struck good fields and have already
spread out in some places to the east of
the British line.
Nothing definite is known of the recent
Canadian threat to cripple the American
coast trade by running a railway from.
Kitimat Arm to Dawson City. There is
no place called Kitimat Arm on any of
the American maps and it is said to be
certain that there is no tide water point
anywhere on the coast where the Cana
dian- Government â¢ could get inland' with
such a line without crossing American
territory unless they came so far down
the coast as to make the undertaking Im
practicable from both a commercial and
an engineering standpoint.

He was thrown against the boiler head

The track was. torn up for a distance
of more than a hundred yards, and it
was difficult to find the cruise of the
wreck. . In fact, the trainmen and offi
cials present were unable to assign any
possible cause, but a railroad man who
was present said it must have resulted
from Improper-surfacing, of the track
around the curve â that is, since the en
gine climbed the outside rail, this rail
could not have been sufficiently raised
above the level of the Inside one for
the degree of the curve and the speed
of the train. Taking into consideration
the lons sections given to a small num
ber of trackmen to keep in repair, It is
not wonderful that. the curves are not
properly surfaced, and this extreme
economy, or criminal negligence, ac
cording to the point of view, is proba
bly responsible for the wreck and loss
of life, although the engineer was new
on this division and may have rounded
the curve at too high a speed.
The- County Assessor, standing by,"
volunteered the information that the
Central Pacific only had four or fiv-Â»
trackmen for a section ten or twelve
miles long, and the same railroad man
quoted heretofore said that that ac
counted for the fact that many of the
spikes were so loose that they did not
hold the rail within an inch of the tie,
and that many of the spikes could eas
ily be withdrawn with one's fingers.
Up. to .11 o'clock to-night the track
was not yet clear, but it is now. hoped
to get. the overlands east and west
started^ about 1 o'clock to-night.
CONDITION OF
SUSHITNA RIVER
Result of Capt. Glenn's
Explorations.
- .â¢â . â â¢ â
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, July Assistant Sec
retary of War Meiklejohn has received
a communication from Captain Edward
T. Glenn, commanding the Cook Inlet ex
ploring expedition in Alaska, dated Ty
conak, Alaska, June 26, 1899, ln which he
describes his experience in taking . the
steamship Duchesne from Ladd's Sta
tion, Cook Inlet, up the Sushitna River.
Captain Glenn says: - - ' "'.''-'- "V.-
"As a result of this trip I feel satisfied
in stating that the Sushitna River is navi
gable for a distance of nearly 135 miles,
which means practically a distance of 160
to 165 miles due north from Tyconak,
or the north foreland of Cook Inlet.
The only boat- that can be used
for navigating the river is. a
light, draught stern-wheeler with suflW
cient power to propel her at the rate of
thirteen to fifteen knots per hour.
"The results of this experimental trip
are certain to be of great benefit to the
entire territory. The latter in case I suc
ceed in finding an overland trail from the
head of navigation of the river to the
Tanana River and Circle City, which I
have every reason to believe from pres
ent information I will succeed in finding.
This trail not only will be valuable dur
ing the. season of navigation, but avail
able for winter vise as well, because the
Tanana Indians as well as the Sklttig Na
tion Indians â  located at the head of the
Sushitna make use of it in bringing their
furs down to market during the .winter or
closed season.
"It would be of value to this section of
Alaska because, first, the valley of the
Sushitna River is very wide and contains
a large amount of arable land which the
season in this portion of Alaska permits
the cultivation with a profit to the pro
ducer, when there is a market for his pro
ducts. Second, because it is now known
that the section of country near the head
of navigation together with the range of
foothills lying between the' Sushitna and
Matunaska rivers and between the head
of navigation and tidewater, with the
small amount of prospecting already un
dertaken there, contains gold in paying
quantities. This gold has, so far as pres
ent Information goes, been found in placer
ground only, yet I have personally seen
gold that I knew came from the section
of the country mentioned of sufficient
coarseness and quantity to indicate to my
mind clearly that it will be, when de
veloped, one of the best mineral producing
sections of that portion of Alaska."

BY JOHN D. DAVIS
SYRACUSE, N. V., July 25.â We
were much disappointed in not
receiving our new cylinder to

that it has come from the factory
through two comiynies, and the trans
fer has caused the delay., They expect
it to arrive late this evening. If it does
we will start to-morrow about 2 o'clock.
I do not believe any motor, has ever
traveled worse roads than have fallen
to our lot, nor has one ever had as se
vere a test. New York State roads are
a disgrace to an unexplored region, let
alone a thickly populated country. It
is a mystery to me how trie farmers
and others who have to "use the roads
in drawing produce to market remain
content with them. Grades have never
been cut, rocks are left to roll about
under foot and wheel, ruts to run
deeper, and things have been left gen
erally to care for themselves. It would
not take much time or money to make
all the roads fairly good and some com
fort to man, wagon and 'beast. I real
ize now why there are so; many knee
sprung horses in the pastures we have
passed. sT-.*-' 'r,f\
Mrs. Davis and I are chafing, under

make up for lost time and make the

shape. We now expect to arrive early

President Kruger on the dynamite con
cession, has given its assurance that it
still has the utmost confidence in Presi

withdrawn his resignaiton.
As to the difference of opinion on the
dynamite concession, General Joubert,
Vice President of the republic, and the
majority of the Volksraad favor can
cellation of the monopoly, while Presi

or the Volksraad desires to buy out the

According to the Cape Town corre

Kruger's resignation is regarded as a
cute move to create a crisis for the
purpose of tiding over the interval un

night from Governor Chanler. address
ed to Captain Middleton of the State
military at Valdosta and Captain
Smith of Thomasville, to "report to
Sheriff Patterson at Bainbridge with
all your available men at once." and
"to act strictly under his orders." The
Governor's message is mandatory. It
says: "Go at once." The commercial
wires having closed, the message was
transmitted over railroad wires from
here and arrangements were im
mediately made for special cars on the
Plant system to take the troops. The
train will arrive at Bainbridge at 3 a.
m. The troops ara wanted to protect
the Sheriff and the jail against the at
tack of a mob that is after John Wil
liams, a negro, who is charged with
assault upon two white girls. Williams
entered their room while they were
asleep and had seized one of the girls,
.when he was frightened away. Many
country people are in town and they
ewear they - ill have vengeance if they
have to dynamite the jail.
The Decatur County Jail is one of the
strongest in the country. An attack
upon it before the arrival of the troops
is possible. At 11:30 o'clock the mob
had surrounded the jail and called for
Williams.

CUT INTO STRIPS
ATLANTA, Ga., July 25.â special to
the Journal from Brinson, Ga,, says:
Charles Mack, the leader of the gang
that has been robbing and assaulting
women in this vicinity, was lynched at

hundreds of pieces. Mack, after having
been identified, was taken to the big
oak tree near the Ogeltree home, on
which Sammins met his death, and
strung up. As his feet left the ground
hundreds of shots from the mob were
fired into his body. After he was dead
he was taken down and his body cut
Into small pieces and distributed among
the mob, which numbered 200 or 300.
Mack led Sammins into the Ogeltree
home, and, after robbing the inmates,
assaulted Mrs. Ogeltree in her hus
band's presence.
COLORED INCENDIARY
HANGED BY A MOB
HOUSTON, Tex., July Two weeks

County. Last night a church at Fuqua
Prairie was burned by an incendiary.
Suspicion -fell on John and Randall
Hamilton,. "negroes. The latter was first
found, and with a rope around his neck
he confessed that John burned the
church. John- was found at his home,
and his answer to a demand to sur
render was a volley of buckshot. Van
Weght being fatally and Tuck Moody
slightly wounded. The negro escaped
badly wounded, but was recaptured to

CHILDREN LOST ON
MOUNT TAMALPAIS
Found 'at Midnight by Walter
Scholl's St. Bernard
Dog.
MILL' VALLEY, July 25.â While
Constable McDonald was walking
homeward at 11 o'clock last night a
woman rushed up to him and hysteric
ally proclaimed that her two little girls
were lost. â¢ She gave her name as Rodg
ers air l said that she had come from
fian Francisco .yesterday and rented
_he Tipping cottage. Late hi the after
uoon her two little girls, one aged 12
and the other 5. had' started for a walk
tip. Mount Tamalpais and they had not
yet returned. She besought the officer
to go in search of them without loss of
time. ' . .
Running to the schoolhouse McDon
ald sounded the alarm bell and in a few
minutes- almost the whole male popu
lation of the town responded. Dividing
into parties the citizens procured lan
terns and began the search for the chil
dren. In the meantime Walter Scholl,
who has charge of the mountain ob
servatory*, was notified by telephone
and sen? his St. Bernard dog out to aid
in the search.
For an hour the women of the com
munity, who were trying to console the
anxious mother, watched the lantern
signals passing between the searching
parties. At midnight the St. Bernard
discovered the children halfway up the
mountain, near the water tanks. They
had wandered around for six hours
and, becoming exhausted, laid down
and cried themselves to sleep. The
barking of the noble animal drew one
of the parties, headed by Dr. John J.
Spottlswood, to the scene, and the chil
dren were soon restored to their moth
er's arms.

BENEFIT OF
A COURT OF
ARBITRATION
William T. Stead Says It
Marks the Beginning of
a New Epoch.
STAND OF AMERICANS
/ â â¢ â
Conference Achieved a Wonderful
Successâ Delegation Surprised
at Its Accomplishments.
Copyrighted, 1599, by the Associated Press.
THE HAGUE, July 25.â 1 have seen
the American delegates and they talked
freely about the conference, but refused
to make a statement about the results
before the conference rises. The fol
lowing, however, may be accepted as a
fairly accurate summary of the views
they entertain;
The conference achieved a great suc
cess, much greater than the delegates
anticipated, and the result was achieved
largely by the amour propre of capable
men from all parts of the world, deter
mined to accomplish somethin worth
their assembling together.
The result surprised all of them, and
the magnitude of the gains is imper
fectly understood even by the confer
ence.
The establishment of a permanent
court of arbitration on the American
principle of revision, plus the French
declaration of the duty of neutrals to
recommend disputing powers to resort
to the arbitration court, rather than to
war, represents vast progress in the
evolution of human society. The recog
nition of the duty to represent to dis
putants the desirability of resorting to
the arbitration court, entails no obliga
tions on the American inconsistent with
their traditional policy. This is made
absolutely clear by the declaration
signed by the American delegation,
read in full at the conference to-day
and entered on the records.
Mr. Low was busily engaged to-day
upon the elaboration of the final act
recording the work of the conference.
Mr. Holla has achieved a position of in
fluence much greater than of many of
the first delegates, and Captain Crozier
is much admired for his plucky fight in
support of his amendment to the Rus
sian resolution of the dumdum bullet.
The returns between American and
other delegates, notably the English,
German and Russian, has been ex
tremely friendly. The Englishmen and
Americans acted throughout almost
like a joint delegation. This was due
to no arrangement or direction, but
solely because both nations found com*
mon ground of defense, common inter
ests, civilization and humanity.
The only point on which the English
delegates failed to support the Ameri
cans was the resolution forbidding the
capture of private property at sea. To
this the English representatives were
not opposed, but British opinion being
divided, the delegates had no instruc
tions regarding the matter and ab
stained from taking action.
After the arbitration convention is
signed, it will probably be opened to
the adhesion of all other powers not
represented at the conference on con
dition that no original signatory of- the
convention object. This right to black
ball any power wishing to join the con
vention was insisted upon by Italy, in
order to prevent the adhesion of the
Pope, and by England on account of
the Transvaal. It is hoped that all the
South American states will come in.
It is the unanimous opinion of all the
American delegates that the conference
begins a new epoch and the good seed
now sown will bear a rich harvest here
after. â WILLIAM T. STEAD.

MANY POWERS SIGN
ARBITRATION CONVENTION
THE HAGUE, July, 25.â the plen-
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, JULY 26, 1899.
ary sitting of the conference this after
noon in deference to Sir Julian Paunce
fote, head of the British delegation, and
in order to secure unanimity, the Dan
ish delegates consented that the refer
ence to the landing of cables be struck
out of the list contained in article 53 of
the convention on the laws of war.
Turkhan Pasha, head of the Turkish
delegation, made formal adhesion to the
arbitration convention on condition
that Turkey's recourse thereto be pure
ly optional. It is understood that about
half the powers, including those form
ing the Dreibund, will sign the arbitra
tion convention immediately.
The third committee met this after
noon to read the report upon the arbi
tration scheme-proposed by Chevalier
Deschamps, the Belgian advocate,
which the committee approved and the
plenary conference adopted without
modification. The committee also ap
proved the final act and then proceeded
to consider the preambles and appen
i dices of the conventions and declara
tions.
The question whether Governments
not represented at the conference may,
by accepting the terms of the arbitra
tion board, secure the advances thereof
without first obtaining the consent of
all the signatory powers, occasioned a
long discussion. It is said the Vatican
has such a right, but the Transvaal has
not. The conference arose without de
ciding the question.

PET MONKEY THE CAUSE
OF A LIVELY ENCOUNTER
School Director Armstrong Mixes Up
With the Owner of the
Animal.
SAUSALITO, July 25.â A pet monkey
owned by Edward Huie. an officer on
'â  the transport Morgan City, was the
cause of a fistic fracas between the
owner and School Director Armstrong
of San Francisco on the ferry boat
Sausalito this evening. Armstrong got
decidedly the worst of the encounter.
Huie has a pet monkey which he re
cently brought with him from Manila-
He was exhibiting it to an admiring
crowd on the lower deck of the boat.
School Director Armstrong was in the
audience and, taking umbrage at some
body jostling him, tried to "get even"
by pushing the person back. This ex
cited Huie's indignation and he uttered
a remonstrance. One word brought on
another and finally Huie handed his
eyeglasses to a friend and pitched into
Armstrong a la Jeffries. He managed
to land two hard swings on Arm
strong's nose before they were separ
ated, with the result that the School
Director's shirt front and the deck of
the boat were plentifully besprinkled
with blood.
"Jim" Bacigalupi. the restaurateur
and politician of North Beach, is al

Last Poem of the Great Agnostic,
' the " Declaration of the Free,"
Read Over the Body.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, July 25.â The funeral
of the late Robert G. Ingersoll took
place this afternoon from Walston,
Dobbs Ferry, where he* died on Friday
last.
No clergyman was present to conduct
the services; there was no music and
there were no pallbearers. The body
lay on a cot in the room where he died.
It was enshrouded in white and just
one red rose placed on the breast.
About the cot were banks of floral
tributes sent by friends, wreaths and
bunches of blossoms. The services were
held at 4 o'clock. Mrs. Ingersoll sat be
side her dead and beside her were her
daughters, Mrs. Walston H. Brown and
Miss Maud Ingersoll. They were very
much agitated and wept almost con
tinuously. Mr. and Mrs. C. P. Farrell
were present, and â¢ Charles Broadway
Rouse, Colonel Ingersoll's oldest friend,
occupied a chair by the side of the bier.
There were some forty others present,
and they remained by Dr. John Clark
Ridpath, who, in a voice full of emo
tion, said: "My friends, it is my very
sad duty to read in the presence of the
dead the last poem written by Colonel
Robert G. Ingersoll, entitled 'The
Declaration of the Free.' This poem
Colonel Ingersoll had read and altered
in some of its parts only a few hours
before he was stricken down."
Major O. J. Smythe, who resides in
Dobbs Ferry, and who was a close per
sonal friend of Colonel Ingersoll; then
without preliminary words read an
other extract from Colonel Ingersoll's
writings, entitled "My Religion."
Dr. John Elliott of New York read the
funeral oration delivered by Colonel
Ingersoll over his brother's body.
This concluded the short and simple
services. Nearly all present then took
a parting look at the dead and passed
out. After they had gone, Mr. Rouse
arose from his chair and as he is total
ly blind, passed his hand over the face
of his, departed friend and said: "Per
haps he is better .now. No one can un
derstand it." Mrs. Ingersoll sail to
him: "The colonel wanted you to put
your hand upon his heart." and suiting
the action to the word, she directed his
hand to the left breast of the deceased.
Mr. Rouse asked what she was going
to do with the remains. "I can't give
him up," she said. "I can't put him in
the ground. I can't bear to think of it.
We're going to bring him back h_me."
The body will probably be taken to
Fresh Pond Thursday for cremation,
but this arrangement is subject to
change. During the morning there
were many visitors to look upon the
face of the deceased. ' Among 'them
were several old colored servants of the
family who had come from Washing
ton and took four days off and paid
their expenses to do honor to their
great benefactor. Among these were
two former butlers of the family.
One old man, who was a baggageman
on the railroad, came from down on
Long Island. Others came from Chi
cago, Syracuse and Buffalo. Many ad
ditional telegrams of sympathy were
received to-day, one of them being
from General Miles. Floral â  tributes
were received all g * the morning and
there were two rooms full of them.
" A photograph of the body was. taken
this afternoon, just as it lay surround- j
Ed by these flowers. It took a three
quarter view of the face.
GENERAL NEGRIER IS
REDUCED IN RANK
Criticized the Action of the Govern
ment in the Rennes
Trial.
PARIS, July 25.â Ministerial
Council decided to-day to dismiss Gen
eral Negrier from the offices of army
Inspector and member of the Superior
Council of War, . thus reducing him to
the mere rank of general of division.
The motive for this exceptional meas
ure, so far made public, is that
General Negrier publicly used language
incompatible with discipline.
The anti-Dreyfusard journal Le
Soir attributes it to spitework on the
part of General Gallifet, because Gen
eral Negrier refused to attend the min
isterial dinner party..
The real cause of his dismissal was
that he criticized the action of the Gov
ernment and instructed the generals
whom he was addressing to tell the of
ficers under them that this state of
things could not last and that the
Rennes trial must be allowed to finish,
but when that question was settled,
the Superior Council of War would call
upon the Government to protect the
army against attacks, and if the Gov
ernment did not act, the Council of
War would see to it.
DYNAMITE TO DIVERT
STREAMS OF LAVA
One Molten Mass From Mauna Loa
Is Now Within Ten Miles
k of Hilo.
VICTORIA, B. C, July 25.â Port
Albert arrived from Honolulu to-day and
went Into the drydock. When she left
Mauna Loa was still in eruption. Three
streams of lava were flowing down the
mountain and one was within ten miles
of Hilo. The use of dynamite to avert it
from -the most populous part of the city
was suggested.
It is said a case of bubonic plague de
veloped aboard the Nippon Maru. A
Chinese died a few days after leaving
China. His body was cremated ln the
ship's furnace in order to destroy all
danger of infection.
As the Port Albert was leaving, the
Weyfield came into Honolulu, loaded with
horses and stores for Manila. The City
of Columbia sailed for China on the 12th
Inst. The Port Albert leaves to-morrow
for Seattle, where she will be fitted up as
a transport to carry cavalry horses to
Manila.

Spanish - American
War Panorama
Is one of the war books which is likely
to be in continuous demand. It is a
panoramic record of the triumphs of
Yankee Doodle. The eagle flaps his
wings on every page, and "Old Glory"
waves around and above every scene.
Prominent officers connected with the
war are here portrayed, as well as
many of the "men behind the guns."
Military life is pictured to the eye, from
recruiting to guard mount and skirmish
line. Nor is the ludicrous omitted. The

CONVICTED
ON PERJURED
TESTIMONY
Friends of the Littlefield
Lynchers to Appeal to
the Governor.
WANT CASE REOPENED
Warrants Issued for the Arrest of
Witnesses Who Testified
Three Years Ago.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
COVELO, July Governor Gage is to
be petitioned to reopen the famous Lit
tlefield lynching case. Relatives of Joseph
Gregory, now serving a twenty-year term
in San Quentin for complicity in the
lynching of the vaquero three years ago,
claim they have overwhelming proof that
the conviction of Gregory and his com
panions. Van Horn and Crow, was ob
tained by means of perjured testimony.
Mrs. Gregory, the mother of the convict,
arrived here to-day with affidavits declar
ing that portions of the evidence were per
jured. She filed the documents with Judge
Cummins, who issued a warrant for the
arrest of Frank Hanover for perjury and
bribery. A telegraphic warrant was dis
patched to Santa Rosa late to-night for
his apprehension.
The arrival here to-day of J. M. Brophy
was coincident to Mrs. Gregory's appear
ance. Brophy is the person who, it is al
i leged, has be*n ot taining retractions by
force from a number of witnesses, to use
them for the benefit of the convicted men.
Brophy claims io have obtained evidence
that proves conclusively that the convic
tion of Crow. Van Horn and Gregory in
the Littlefield case was obtained by bri
bery, perjury and intimidation.
Brophy is accused of having enticed
Witness Doolittle into the woods and
i there obtained a confession from him that
I he swore falsely in the Gregory case. The
! "confession" was obtained at the point of
a pistol. Regarding this Brophy says:
"I first visited the Doolittle camp in the
I latter part of June and exhibited for his
inspection a number of affidavits from
many of the best citizens of Round Val
ley. These statements all questioned Doo
i little's testimony in the Littlefield case,
I and he finally admtlted that he had per
. jured himself and was willing to make an
affidavit to this effect, which he did be
' fore Justice of the Peace Jamison of
i Blocksburg. Doolittle was recompensed
I with twenty-five head of cattle for his
testimony." ',- .
Many arrests for perjury will soon be
'â¢ made. Marshal Redwine was seen to hur
riedly drive out of town at a late hour to
i night with warrants in his pocket.

"TELL THE AMERICANS
NOT TO LAY ANY ODDS"
Captain Hogarth's Advice When
Asked Regarding the Sham
rock's Chances.
LONDON, July 2.".â yacht Shamrock
left Rothesay Bay for Greenock to-day
to complete fitting out for her voyage
across the Atlantic, which will be begun
a week hence. Sir Thomas Lipton, owner
of the challenger, says the crew of the
Shamrock will be increased to fifty. Cap-
I tain Hogarth of the Shamrock refused to
express any opinion to-day as to the
yacht's chances for winning the cup, but
said: "Tell the Americans not to lay
any odds."
GREENOCK, July Elaborate prep
arations are being made here for the
, Shamrock's Atlantic voyage. She will be
: ketch-rigged and her hull will be
strengthened by a novel and especially
designed system of screw braces and
trusses. Her hull will be strapped from
end to end with heavy stays and screw
trusses will then be led from side to side
and screwed until they bear hard against
the stays. Similar screw braces will be
! led from the bilge to the deck, and when
all are screwed up the hull will be se
cured against all chance of working,
I straining or giving in any direction. The
j deck will be protected against the At
! lantic breakers she may possibly encoun
ter by a heavy sheathing of planking
j bolted to the supports below.
When all is completed it is expected she
will be as safe as a liner, and, unless ex
ceptionally unfortunate, she will arrive in
American waters in such perfect condi
tion that refitting for racing will be a
comparatively simple matter.

Â»â  Boxing Carnival at Dubuque. Â«
Club arena the following evening. Presi
dent James' H. Kennedy of the Excelsior
Club secured a boxing permit from the
Supervisors yesterday, while the San
Francisco Athletic Club will hold its cus
tomary exhibition late in August.
The Neill-McConnell bout is expected to
attract a good attendance, as the prin
cipals have a large following of friends.
Two promising preliminaries have been
arranged, each of ten rounds, with the
privilege of additional ones, If necessary,
to determine a winner. The first will be
between "Jack" Kane and "Doc" Flynn.
and the second between "Jack" Ennis and
"Jack" McMahon. These men have been
showing excellent work before the ama
teur clubs.. As they are all boxing for
reputations, they should supply excellent
sport. â¢ - '-^rf'-.-
The bouts at the Olympic Club are all
attractive ones, as the best available men
in the semi-professional class have been
brought together. F. Ast, who won in the
recent tournament after a whirlwind bat
tle, has been matched against R. A.
Woods, the last pupil turned out by Wal
ter Watson before his departure for the
East. Both men are clever boxers and
exceptionally hard hitters; hence their
bout will hardly last the prescribed ten
rounds.
Charles Vickers, who is a veritable
fighting machine, will meet George Baker
of Salt Lake City, while George Simpson.
a product of the Acme Club, Oakland, will
have for an opponent Charles Thurston
of the San Francisco Athletic Club, the
kindergarten of lighters. Members of the
Olympic Club will be admitted free of
charge to the bouts, outsiders being
charged a reasonable admission fee.
Geoige Dawson, one of the cleverest
boxers which Australia has sent to this
country, arrived here on Monday. In the
palmy days of the California Athletic
Club Dawson was one of the favorite
boxers with the members. Possibly his
most memorable battle here was with
Danny Needham, on July 26, IS9O, for a
$2000 purse. Dawson knocked Needham
out in the twenty-ninth round. Both men
are in this city and show little effects of
their experience in the ring-. Dawson has
been in the East some years, coming here
from Chicago.
PARDON MAY BE DEATH.
Nevada Anxious to Try John Han-
cock for Murder.
Strong pressure is being brought to bear
to induce Governor Gage to pardon John
Hancock, who is at present serving a ten
years' sentence at San Quentin for bur
glary. Should the pardon be secured,
Hancock will In all probability be taken to
Nevada and charged with the murder of
Dr. George Engelke and Peter Edmon
ston.
About "nine months ago Winifred Mey
ers, at one time the mistress of Hancock,
told of the fearful crime which he com
mitted in 1897 while crossing the desert
from Perris to Salt Lake City. Hancock,
with Winifred Meyers, met Dr. Engelke
and Edmonston on their journey. The
four formed a party and traveled to
gether. When out a few days Hancock
suggested to the woman a plan to kill
both the strangers, rifle their possessions
and carry away all that was valuable.
The woman claims that she attempted to
dissuade him from the crime but was un
successful, for the very next night he '
split open the heads of Edmonston and i
Engelke while they were sleeping. Ail ,
that was worth taking was carried away, j
the remainder being buried to hide the
traces of the crime. Hancock afterward i
came to this State and was caught in j
Santa Ana, where he confessed to the ,
charge of burglary. The Nevada authori- !
ties nave been collecting evidence of the
crime, and they now claim to have suf
ficient proofs of Hancock's guilt. '

cided to test the law a conclusion will be
reached shortly. A match race will be
arranged between two dogs and bets wul
be made on the outcome of their meeting.
The authorities will be notified of the'
proposed infraction of the law and the
coursing men will then submit to arrest.
They will be taken out on a writ of
habeas corpus and the case pressed to a
conclusion as speedily as possible. Should
the court decide against them the officials
will then direct their energies toward the
upbuilding of a new park. There are
several available sites in San Mateo Coun
ty near the county line which are suit
able for coursing. If no* relief is to be
had in this county the coursing men will
go elsewhere to resume the sport with
which they have been so long identified.
"FAUST" AT THE GRAND.
Miss Julie Cotte Makes Her Appear-
ance in the Role of Mar
guerite.
The audience at the Grand Opera House
last evening was neither so large nor so
appreciative as on the previous evening.
It might possibly have been that they were
reserving their enthusiasm till they s**w
how the prima donna, Miss Julie Cotte,
came out of the trying ordeal of her lirst
appearance in the role of the loving and
wronged Marguerite, and this supposi
tion received some confirmation by '.he
fact that after her prayer for forgiveness
in the last act she was greeted with a
burst of warm applause. She has a true
and finely trained voice, but It seemed to
lack power for the part. Possibly from
nervousness her low notes were not
rendered with sufficient distinct
ness. In the garden scene her
acting was excellent, and the jewel
song was given with the 'charm and
expression of a true artist. The other
members of the company sustained the
favorable impression they made on the
opening night. Winifred Golf was in
splendid voice and was enthusiastically
applauded for his solo. "When Far From
Home." The soldiers' chorus is on*- of
the features of the opera and had to be
repeated. There should be crowed houses
during the remainder of the week.

HARBOR COMMISSIONERS MEET.
They Decide to Place the Ferry Build
ing at the Disposal of the Native !
Sons and Daughters.
A special committee from the Native
Sons and Daughters, consisting of Mrs.
A. D. Codington, Mrs. V. R. Bury, Mrs.
H. E. Faure and P. F. Mertes, waited
upon the Harbor Commissioners at their
weekly meeting yesterday and requested
that body to permit them to hold a recep- ;
tion In the ferry building when the Cali
fornia Regiment returns home.
With little hesitancy the board unani
mously decided to allow the committee to
banquet the California boys in the spa
cious navts of the building.
The tables will be set In the corridor,
which is fully six hundred feet long, 'Ine
commissioners placed the entire building
at the disposal of the reception commit
tee. The stone floors will be covered with
either canvas or sawdust to protect tnem
from grease stains.
The commissioners also decided to place
the Irwin at the disposal of the Governor
of Nebraska and his party on the day the
Nebraska volunteers arrive here. '1 ne
board adjourned to meet again next
Thursday afternoon at 2:30 o'clock.

SPEEDY RELIEF AND RADICAL CURE.
Speedy and radical cure of NASAL CATARRH. THROAT DISEASES,
BRONCHITIS AND AFFECTIONS OF THE LUNGS, and all complaints
that lead to CONSUMPTION.
By DR. ABORN, 554 Sutter St,
All who are suffering from Catarrh of the Headâ that loathsome disease,
Bo prolific of evil consequencesâ can be speedily and permanently cured if
they apply for treatment in season. There arc thousands of cases of Throat
Disease, Bronchitis and Consumption due solely to Catarrh, to say nothing of
Its less terrible consequences; Impaired Sense of Hearing, Smell. Taste and
Sight, the Loss of Hair and Teeth, the disgusting Effluvia of the Breath, the
Dingy Complexion, Dyspepsia, Neuralgia, etc. These are. in numberless
cases, caused solely by Catarrh of the Head. The disease afflicts thousands
who have never suspected its presence. Its symptoms are 30 diverse in dif-
ferent individuals as to often mislead the sufferer and his medical adviser.
The only safe and proper course ie to have an examination from a physi-
cian competent to make a correct diagnosis, and to cure the evil when found
to exist. Dr. Aborn cures this loathsome disease after the ordinary modes of
treatment have failed, no matter how severe or aggravated the caue' may be or
of how long standing. -ir- ;-v-. :
OVER 30 TEARS DEVOTED TO THE TREATMENT OF DISEASES OF
THE HEAD, THROAT AND LUNGS.
DR. ABORN'S TREATMENT
Gives instantaneous relief, builds up and revitalises the whole constitution,
fortifies the system against colds and catarrhal affections and averts the ten-
dency or predisposition to consumption, and thereby prolongs life.

Captain Ducat, Twenty- Fourth United
States Infantry, Will Probably Suc
ceed Colonel Plummer as Gen
eral Shafter's Aid.
How to welcome the California regiment
when it arrives is becoming a more and
more pressing subject with the commit
tee on reception of home-coming troops.
There was a meeting of the executive
committee of the general committe yester
day in the office of the Mayor, in which It
was decided to call' a meeting of the com
mittee of Native Sons and Daughters, rel
atives of the California troops. Adjutant
General Seamans. General Dickinson, Gen
eral Warfield and General Muller to de
cide upon some programme upon the de
tails of which the various committees
could get to work. The joint meeting will
be held in the Mayor's office next Fri
day afternoon at 3 o'clock.
General Shafter sent word to the meet
ing yesterday that the hospital ship Relief
might be in at any time. He informed Lie
committee that the sick soldiers would
nut be brought to the wharf, but would
be taken off the vessel in the stream and
â¢taken at once to the Presidio, probably
on the Government steamer McDowell.
The committee decided to send an offer
ing of fruit to the sick soldiers. Mrs. W.
li. Harrington and Mrs. Sanborn, of the
Red Cress Society notified the committee
mat the society would do what it could
tor the men as" soon as they reached the
Presidio.
The following movements of transports
was furnished to the committee by the
headquarters:. - '.-:â¢
Keh it (hospital ship) expected daily.
Hancock left Manila July 1; due here, say,
July ao. Senator left Manila July 1; due
nere, s_y, Juiy -30. Centennial left Manila
July "2; due here, say, August 11; Warren
left Manila Juiy 17; due here, say, August
lb. bnerman expected to leave Manila
daily. Grant will leave Manila soon.
the dates are figured upon an average
run of thirty days. The Hancock will
bring the Nebraska and Utah troops; the
Senator the Pennsylvania men; the War
ren die Colorado regiment, and the Sher
man or Grant the California boys.
.Major Gerard, surgeon in charge of the
general hospital at tne Presidio, made an
investigation of the men who arrived on
tne Inaiana Monday ln order to find what
men could be removed trom the hospitals
to the various camps. The question cf
room may become an important one be
fore long, although there is no apprehen
sion that .any sick men will go uncared
for. The results of the surgeon's examina
tion was that he found eight or nine men
out of the eighty at the general hospital
nt for duty and willing to perform it, and
as many more out or the three hundred
at the convalescent hospital. He counted
only those who admitted that they felt
well enough to enter service again and
whom- he found to be so after examining
them. â¢ ; ' ?â '. -
the hospital facilities at the Presidio
have so far been ample, and the desire
is to keep them so within the present lim
its if possible. For that reason it is th<j
intention of the commandant to send the
men out into the camps as soon as tney
are in a condition to be removed from th.c
hospital buildings. If the patients should
multiply too rapidly, however, another one
of the brick barracks will be pressed into
service, or perhaps two more. In any j
event the hospital accommodations will i
be kept sufficient to meet any possible |
emergency.
Lieutenant Colonel Plummer returned to
Vancouver Barracks yesterday. He was
down here on business connected with his
regiment, the new Thirty-fifth Infantry,
the examination of officers and the mus
tering in of recruits, and this having been
completed he was ordered away. He had
been, until his promotion to lieutenant
colonel of volunteers, an aid on the per
sonal staff of General Shafter. His as
signment to other duties leaves a vacancy
that will be filled, it is reported, by Cap
tain Ducat, quartermaster of the Twenty
fourth Infantry, who started for Manila
on the City of Para about the 13th Inst.
Captain Ducat has in all probability been
intercepted at Honolulu by one of the
liners, and has been ordered home to his
new duties.
When the Newport sails she will carry
400 recruits and the Ohio 300, besides a
battalion ofthe Nineteenth Infantry. This
will probably be distributed between the
two transports. The following -officers will
acompany the men: Major Owen J. Sweet,
Twenty-third Infantry; Captain John A
Dapr.ay, Twenty-third Infantry; Captain
C. L. Collins. Twenty-third Infantry;
Lieutenant L. J. Van Schalck, Fourth In
fantry; Lieutenant S. W. Nowes, Twenty
third Infantry; Lieutenant L. R. Lang,'
Ninth Infantry, and Lieutenant W. S.
Bradford, Seventeenth Infantry.
The officers and many of the men who
returned on the transport Morgan City
are much annoyed at being included in
the denunciation of the authorities which
the Examiner is so assiduously fostering.
According to the statements made, the of
ficers and men who returned on the Mor
gan City are unanimous in their criti
cisms, but this seems to be far from the
fact. There are a few who revile and
denounce, but the great majority have
had no complaint to make and they dis
like to be placed in the position of being
"kickers.' Captain Andrew Jensen, First
Montana Infantry, United States Volun
teers, gave the sentiment of the officers
when h said they had nothing to complain
of and so far as their superior officers
were concerned they had no criticism to
make. The officers will not pass upon the
efficiency of their generals, but they do
s. iy the men were not ill-treated. *
Colonel Marshall, department quarter
master, has received orders from Wash
ington to .purchase 300 horses, more or
less, on this coast. Presumably they are
for the use of the Fourth Cavalry now In
Manila. Lieutenant Colonel Randolph Is
now on his way to Oregon to gather in all
the likely looking horses he can find to
fill the order. The animals must be sound
In -every respect, between five and seven
years old and between 900 and 1000 pounds
In weight. They will be part of the lot of
3000 which the Government is purchasing
and which will be sent to Manila as fast
as they can be got ready. The first in
stallment of 200 will probably sail on the
Tacoma to-morrow.
First Lieutenant Henry L. Kinrtison,
Twenty-fifth Infantry, has been detailed
.as quartermaster of the transport In
diana. â ' . ' â¢

and Maple streets was formally dedicated
j with appropriate ceremonies last evening.
| Professor Charles L. Tisdale. vice presi
dent of the board of trustees of the col
' lege, presided and the spacious lecture
! room was filled to overflowing with
, friends of the Institution who had as
] sembled to listen to the addresses and ex
! cellent music which made up the pro
j gramme. While the guests were being
j seated Brandt's orchestra played the
i' "Stars and Stripes," followed by "Caval
! leria Rusticana." After an Invocation by
1 Rev. Dr. .Adams Professor Tisdale made
j a brief address of welcome. He spoke as
j follows:
Ladies and Gentlemen: On behalf of. the
trustees of the Hahnemann Hospital Col
! lege 1 welcome you to-night to the for
mal dedication of this beautiful building.
1 feel, my friends, that this is certanily
the most important event in the long and
honorable history of homeopathy on this
i coaat. for after years of weary wander
i ing the opening of the seventeenth ses
j sion of the college finds us at last in our
' home, surrounded by all the comforts and
I luxuries that honestly belong to the dis
ciples of Samuel Hahnemann. In all the
' pride and happiness of the present I can
: not yet forget the trials and hardships
! of the past; those weary anxious years
1 when the darkened sky came down close
upon us and the cheerless horizon shut
us in so hopelessly. How many of us
came near giving up the struggle I dare
not say, for to-night in the joy and pride
J of our new possession we are happy in
the substantial fulfillment of our fond
est hopes, and with faces set toward the
rising sun we are confident of a glorous
future for the Hahnemann Hospital Col
lege of San Francisco. On behalf of the
trustees I wish to thank most heartily all
the kind friends, both professional and
other, who by their matchless generosity
and co-operation have made our fondest
dreams a most useful reality. The mag
nificent gift of $3000 from the Southern
Homeopathic Dispensary, the substantial
donation from the physicians of Southern
California, the splendid assistance of the
Alumni of the college, the numerous pri
vate benefactions for various specific
purposes, together with the generous
contributions from homeopathic physi
cians from all parts of California, have
enabled us to erect and equip this beau
tiful building, which I am confident will
contribute largely to the glory of ho
meopathy and the constant advancement
of medical science.
Another selection by the orchestra fol
lowed and then Professor Tisdale Intro
duced Mayor Phelan. The Mayor warmly
congratulated the Hahnemann faculty on
the substantial evidence of the prosperity
of the college as evidenced by the pro
gress it had made since its incorporation
and also congratulated San Francisco on
Its possession. The Mayor's speech, which
was delivered in his happiest vein, was
warmly received. The feature of the ex
ercises, however, was without question
the address, of Professor James W. Ward,
M. D., dean of the faculty, a brief sum
mary of which follows:
The curtain is almost down on the great
est century in the world's history. We are
to-night in the glorious twilight of this
magnificent century, whose close will for
ever cast into history the 'working of a
medical reformation which began over a
hundred years ago in one of the hamlets
of Northern Germany. Beneath the gray
skies of a northern climate and from a
race "impatient of ignorance where knowl
edge is impossible, most eager and enter
prising where the darkness is the thick
est," the germ of truth in medicine took
its root, developed into a system and has
grown to mighty proportions. All this has
been accomplished by the great Intellectual
courage of Hahnemann and his following.
There is nothing in the world's history
that commands greater respect than cour
age.
Hahnemann as a philosopher was an
opponent, aye, the very antipode, of the
modern system of materialism.
It has been said that the great physi
cian of the future is the one who is to
prevent disease So Hahnemann was a
pioneer in hygiene. In his first original
work, a treatise on scrofula, published in
Lelpsic in 1784, at the time when almost
nothing existed of hygiene and sanitary
science, he showed a fair knowledge and
appreciation of its value by recommending
exercise and open air. He recorded a
brilliant achievement by suggesting the
benefits of change and the seashore life.
Cold water was emphasized as a remedial
agent, and the importance of personal hy
giene clearly made known.
He was probably the. first physician In.
the world to Introduce the mild, kindly,
non-restraint method in the treatment of
the Insane. While in charge of the hos
pital for the insane at Georgenthal, In 1782,
he introduced reforms that have never
ceased to live. He allowed no Insane per
son to be punished by blows or other 111
treatment, "for,'.' said he, "there can be
no punishment where there is no respon
sibility; such parties cannot be improved,
but must be rendered â¢ worse by rough
treatment." Hahnemann foreshadowed
the successful antiseptic treatment of the
present half-century by referring to the
treatment of diseased bone. He said: "I
scraped the carrious bone clear out and
dressed It with alcohol." At the same
time he introduced nitrate of sliver as a
powerful germicide. In 1789 he awakened
the chemical world to an admiration for
his genius by the discovery of the "exact
mode of preparing the soluble mercury,"
a secret long and earnestly sought, like
the philosopher's stone In olden time.
In 1831 we find Hahnemann announcing
the germ theory. This theory stands to
day in certain diseases .as a recognized
cause the world over. It was from the ef
forts now put forth at this stage of his
career that there came out from the dark
ness of ignorance, superstition and error
the formula "Simllia, Simillbus, Curan
tur," a free interpretation of which is,
"Diseases are to be cured by those medi
cines which produce symptoms most near
ly resembling them in the healthy body."
To him belongs the honor of discovering
how to administer the materia medica, \
namely, in the smallest doses that will
cure. In this advance the old school has
followed, and now everywhere they yield
to the administration of the smaller dose.
This one triumph alone would have been
worth living a life to attain and would
have made his name immortal. It is there
fore the aim of this college to point out
scientific medicine as he directed the way.
supplemented by all the more recent
methods of research. The medical science
of to-day has been erected on the sub
stratum of centuries of experience. The
mysteries of yesterday are the facts of
to-day.- v--,- '

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, JULY 26, 1899.
HE DOESN'T CARE IF
SHE NEVER COMES BACK
ELLIS SWAIN AND MISS JOHNSON WINKED AND LOVED
V. *"â¢ DLIS SWAIN, a dimpled youth who has not yet cast his first vote,
!=-3 is searching for his bride of two days, pretty Ethel Johnson. Swain
has a vague idea that the charming Ethel is enjoying a solitary
j' ? honeymoon in the vicinity of Santa Cruz. But her whereabouts gives
him no uneasiness. "I don't care if she never comes back," he says.
"I believe her folks have sent her down to Santa Cruz. If she doesn't want
me I don't want her. and that settles It."
Swain and the fair Ethel were married on Friday last in Oakland by
Justice of the Peace Stetson. Reginald Landerhurst was best man and Miss
Edna Rock was bridesmaid. There were no guests at the wedding and the
parents of the contracting parties were conspicuous by their absence.
After the ceremony the young couple returned from the Sleepy City and
Swain Installed his bride at the Golden West Hotel. On Saturday the newly
wedded couple called upon Mrs. Swain's people, who reside at 522 Eddy street,
and Papa and Mamma Johnson stretched forth their respective hands and
cried. "Bless youâ you, my children."
"Come to dinner Sunday," said mamma-in-law. Mr. and Mrs. Swain
went, and that was the beginning of the end. â¢=_: *
"Everything was lovely on Saturday,'" said the young husband, "and
everybody seemed pleased. But on Sunday everything was changed. As soon
as we got Into the house Mrs. Johnson called Ethel into another room,
where they remained together for some time- When my wife got back
her eyes were red and swollen. Then she told me that her mother threat
ened to annul our wedding and declared she would have her put Into the
Magdalen Asylum. 'Come home with me,' I said, and she answered, 'I would
like to but I can't.' I then left the house and I have not seen my wife since."
The courtship of Ellis Swain and Ethel Johnson was as romantic and hur
ried as was their subsequent wedding and separation. Three weeks ago
Swain met Miss Johnson at the Alcazar Theater. Her bright brown eyes
favorably attracted the youth's attention. He smiled, at her. She smiled
back. Then he winked his eye and she winked hers. And after that it was
all up with both the young people. \ . i'C'\
"At the theater that night," said Swain, "Ethel's aunt was with her,
and I was with Reggie, who afterward acted as my best man.' Weâ that is
Ethel and Iâ flirted during the show. After the play I went up to her and
tipped my hat. Reggie did the same to the aunt.. The aunt is young. Ethel
is not quite 17 and her aunt Is fully 17. Then I walked home with Ethel and
Reggie walked with auntie. Then I gave Ethel my telephone number and we
were soon very good friends." 'â /â â ' .-â¢ - . -.
According to Swain, the courtship lasted nearly three weeks. During that
time he called at the Johnson home often when the mother was out.
"It was this way," explained Swain. "Mrs. Johnson works and has to get
to the store at 8 o'clock. I do not have to get to the shop until 9, so every
morning from 8 till 9 I spent the time with Ethel. On Thursday last we de
cided to get married. Friday morning I called at the usual hour. Ethel went
to the grocery and telephoned for Edna Rock. She came along and we went
to Oakland, and got married." , t^ . ;'.-;-
Since the day Swain's wife bade him a cold farewell he has heard from
his mother-in-law. "She called me up by telephone," he explained. "She
said, 'Hello.' I said, 'Where's Ethel?' 'Gone to Santa Cruz,' She answered.
'I'm going to annul that marriage, and you will never see her again.' "
And so the matter rests. And the boy, who can't, recall what play was
being presented on the night he met Ethel Johnson, takes the matter calmly
and says, "I don't care if she never comes back."
Young Swain is the son of Dr. E. M. Swain, the dentist, and is employed
ln his father's office as a mechanical dentist. The young wife is a lady of
leisure. Her mother works in a dressmaker-shop and her father is a house
painter by profession.

Lem Sang Suspected of Wielding the
Cleaver Which Was Found
Beside the Dead
Woman.
One of the most brutal and most bloody
murders committed in Chinatown during
its already dark career was discovered by
the police last night in a room on the top
floor of a lodging-house at 809 Stockton
street. The sight that greeted the eyes of
Police Officers Dinan, Hurd and High
land when the door to the room was burst
open by their combined efforts sickened
them, hardened as they are to sights of
that kind. A woman partly undressed lay
on the floor In a pool of her blood and by
her side was a butcher's cleaver, which
had been used in ending her existence.
The sight of her face and body was ghast
ly and Instantly recalled the brutal mur
ders said to have been committed in
Whitechapel, London, by "Jack the Rip
per." The unforunate woman's throat
had been cut and her teeth knocked out
by her infuriated assailant. Her right
hand was jammed in her throat as if she
had made an effort to save herself from
being hacked to pieces. Her body was
also terribly cut. When turned over by
the Morgue officials more gashes were
found.
That there was a struggle was appar
ent from the condition of the room. The
windowshade, which threw a blood-red
glare on the interior of the room, was
torn trom its fastening. The chairs in the
room were overturned and broken and
various articles of wearing apparel were
scattered all over the floor. The bed on
which the poor woman was lying when |
dragged to her doom by her relentless â¢
murderer was disarranged and gave every
indication of having been the starting
place of the deadly struggle. It was
thought no one but a crazy man could
have committed such a crime and the of
ficers expect when they arrest the mur
derer to find him in that condition.
About three weeks ago the woman, who
is unknown, and a Chinaman named Lern
Sang, 'who it is thought is the murderer,
moved into the small hovel on the top
floor of the tenement house owned by
Jeung Bin, and which is immediately op
posite the Chinese Consulate. Almost the j
day the new arrivals came they began the |
quarreling, which was incessant up to the j
time one of them was quieted for all time. |
Last night about 9 o'clock the noise they
made aroused the Inmates of the house, j
and complaint was made to the landlord,
Jeung Bin. C. Akabane, a Japanese; who |
lives immediately under the room, occu
pied by the couple, was unable to steep, ;
and he went upstairs and knocked at their j
door to remonstrate with them. Not re
ceiving an answer, and as their. quarreling
did not cease he went down to the base
ment and informed Bin. Bin also tried to
pacify the inmates, and not being 'success
ful went down the street and informed
Officer Dinan. The latter went back- to
the house and hammered on the door with
his club, but whether the murderer had
accomplished his work and escaped, or
the couple in true Chinese fashion recog
nizing the tread of the policeman's feet |
on the stairs, decided to keep quiet, is i
unknown. Getting no response to his j
hammering on the door Dinan left the
house and walked down the street, where !
he joined Officers Hurd and Highland. The j
latter had just been told by another
Chinaman that a crazy Celestial was
brandishing a pistol and threatening to
kill any one who would go near him, on
Clay street, immediately around the cor- j
ncr from the scene of the murder. Hurd !
and Highland were on the point of going
to arrest the pistol wielder, but had, at
the request of their informant, waited
until he could go there and see how mat
ters were, so as to report to the officers.
. It was while waiting for the informant,
to return that Dinan came along and told
them of the fight in the room on Stockton
street. At his request Hurd and Highland
accompanied him back to the room and
after' repeated knocks, which were un
answered, the officers burst in the door
and were startled by the terrible scene.
A thorough search of the room was j
made by them without finding a trace of |
the murderer. They discovered the apert
ure through which he escaped after com
mitting the crime and also found his coat,
which was left behind in his flight. An
opium lamp, still lighted, was found on
the bed and the officers wondered how it
was the bedding did not take fire during
the death struggle.
The Morgue was at once notified and
! also the California-street police station.
j Four policemen were at once sent from
the latter place and they aided in the
I search. They climbed over the roofs and I
! discovered the scratches made by the !
i murderer while escaping. They also j
I found an open skylight through which he
i must have jumped and gained his egress
I to Stockton street.
No one in the tenement house would 'â 
! open its doors to the inquiring policemen j
' and very little could be learned about the ;
â¢ antecedents of the murdered woman and
the man who committed the deed. De
tective McMahon is. hard at work on the
case and has hopes of landing the mur
derer within a few hours.

deceased, stated that during his tests he
had found no evidences of volatile poi
sons. There were strong traces of mor
phine in the stomach. He acknowledged,
in reply to queries â  made by Attorney
Terry that a large dose of morphine ad
ministered medicinally would cause the
same chemical reaction noted. While Dr.
Morgan was testifying, and particularly
while he was describing the gradual ef
fects of an overdose of morphine for the
information of the defense. Dr. Wachen
dorf listened attentively, and shook his
head frequently as if to disparage the
truth of the statements made by the wit
ness.
Dr. A. Fehlen. the physician who^at the
request of Dr. Wachendorf attended Keh
lenbeck a few weeks before his death,
was called. He stated- that Kehlenbeck at
first showed symptoms of nervous col
lapse, and .he (the witness) administered
chloroform to quiet his patient. This visit
was made about June 10. On the morn- i
ing of June 26 he was again called by Dr.
Wachendorf. He found Kehlenbeck in a
deep coma caused by narcotic poisoning.
He treated his patient for four hours, ad
ministering strychnine and atropine to
stimulate the heart, then weak, irregular
and thready and indicative of vital ex
haustion. After four hours the patient
rallied. The pulse became strong. There
was every hope of recovery. Witness said

him to "stand by him" in case there was

ONCE MORE Th|E OLD LESSON.
ONCE more the sweep of fires over wide i:reas
of farms and forests repeats for Californians
the disastrous lessons of the past. Each suc
g year brings this lesson with the dry season..
the wealth and the population of the State in
the annual losses increase. The aggregate
value of the farm crops, the pastures and the woods
ed in even a single year, it is impossible to ac
curately compute: but it is safe to say the amount far
exceeds what would be required to prevent them by
the establishment of an efficient system of forest pro
tection.
At the present time the warning lesson is going on
in the district around San Andreas. The fire broke
out on Saturday afternoon and by midnight had
spread to a conflagration having a front nearly ten
miles .vide and swept forward fully seven miles dis
tant from the starting point.
The reports of Monday from the scene of the dis
.i^ter say:
"The region in which the fire is now raging is the
richest and finest grazing and agricultural section in
the county. It is heavily timbered, with heavy belts
of greasewood, which burns like oil, and against
which it is futile to fight. The fire has been gaining
in intensity since yesterday morning despite the fact
that hundreds of men have been zealously laboring
night and day to prevent it spreading. It is hoped
that the Calaveras River bed may prove a barrier to
the fire. If this hope is not realized the conflagration
undoubtedly will prove the most disastrous ever seen
in the State. Fires are raging in the mountains back
of Mokelomne Hill and along the Upper Stanislaus.
The former is endangering the Amador Canal Com
t any'? flumes, while the. latter is in heavy timber and
threatens the great electric power lines that are being
operated in that region."
Surely the people of California are too intelligent
to fail to learn wisdom in the end from repeated ex
periences oi this kind. The San Andreas fire is not
an isolated case. Similar occurrences have been fre
quent every year and in every part of the State.
Before the rains come this fall we shall have to chron
icle many disasters of the kind, and some of them
may be even more destructive than that which is now
raping. They will occur in the valleys and in the
mountains, along the coast and in the Sierras. Hardly
a county will escape their visitation, and the total
damage done will mount high up into the millions
of dollars.
It is the old question, put to the people of Califor
nia: "What are you going to do about it?" These
tires are to a large extent the result of negligence. If
the people, acting through the State government, will
exercise a due carefulness in protecting the forests,
they will be able to rid themselves of the menace
which returns with each returning dry season. Expe
rience teaches everybody except fools, and if we do
pot learn from the fearful lessons experience' has
taught in this matter, we will be among the fools
whom nature delights to destroy.
THE RETURN OF THE INVALIDS.
rOR the reception of the wounded and the sick
officers and men, brought home from the wars
and the pestilential climate of the Philippines,
there can be of course nothing in the way of a grand
popular demonstration. Triumphal arches, strains of
military music and the clamor of rejoicing thousands
are of no avail here. It must be by the tenderest and
most loving ministrations that the joy of the public
over their return and the popular pride in their heroic
service must be made known.
It Aouid not be right to reserve for those heroes of
the war who have the good fortune to return safe
and sound all our public manifestations of honor and
of loyalty. There should be open and exultant
praise for the wounded, as well as for tho^e who come
"unscathed to share with us in the joyous civic festi
vals we are preparing to receive them. Something
should be done to cheer the invalids with the proul
assurance of the gratitude of the nation and of the
people.
In a few days we shall have the gratification of
greeting the Nebraska Volunteers with a cordiality
not less than that with which we welcomed the Ore
gon s. Later on we shall make a week- of festivals for
rejoicing over the return of our own boys. All these
will give ample opportunities for parades, for music,
for theater nights and popular receptions; with ban
quets and all the glad uproar of public demonstra
tions. At present we are in the presence of the in
valids â the men who bear the scars and the diseases
f the war. They are the heroes who have suffered
To them our deepest sympathy goes forth, and that
sympathy should have its expression in a manner
that will be visible and audible to all. They cannot
share in our festivals, but we can share and ought to
lighten as far as possible the burden of the suffering
they have undergone for the flag;. {
THE DEOTH OF LLOYD TEVIS.
THE death of Lloyd Tevis has made a gap in the
ranks of the capitalists of the Pacific Coast.
The vast properties he had accumulated, how
ever, identified him with the East as well as with the
West. Indeed, his name and his financial standing
were broadly recognized throughout the world. For
forty-nine years, without any serious, interruption, in
spired by a steady purpose and exercising great abil
ity, energy and perseverance, he traveled the road of
progress, until, when his life culminated, he stood
among the magnates of this age of concentrated
achievement and intense activity.
There was a wide distinction between Mr. Tevis and
many of his wealthy contemporaries. His reputation.
' did not depend upon the realized fortune he had
amassed. It was bated upon his individual capacity,
manifested through a long succession of years in
enterprises and in transactions of unusual magnitude
and complexity. He belonged to that unparalleled
emigration of 1849 that ever since has shed luster
upon our State and upon our national' history. After
working a rocker near Ringgold, in El Dorado
County, for two or three months he conceived a bril
liant financial scheme, almost his solitary failure, which
he often claimed had retarded his financial growth
for nearly a year. He constructed a bridge across
the South Fork of the American River, at a
point which all the immigration wagons that reached
! California by the Carson route had to pass. His mis
calculation was that, instead of paying tolls, the im
migrants of 1850 took possession of the property,
which he was forced to abandon. He went straight to
Sacramento, labored night and day in the Recorder's
office there, saved and invested his money, and, be
fore the end of the year, had formed his. famous part
nership with J. B. Haggin, which, in the very nick of
time and when property in the State capital had
reached its highest valuation, was transferred to San
Francisco. The details of his subsequent life would
fill volumes, and will undoubtedly be preserved in
permanent form.
Mr. Tevis had received a collegiate and a legal edu
cation and in his early years became conversant with
practical business. When his identification with San
Francisco was complete, in addition to the constantly
enlarging investments of his firm, he was employed
as referee in very important cases, in which his clear
discrimination and his sound judgment commanded
fees of almost fabulous amounts. Still later, in con
nection with railroads and express companies and in
other relations, he displayed extraordinary adminis
trative ability. Perhaps he settled more lawsuits than
any man of his day, not excepting even the late John
B. Felton. In diplomatic management, in the com
bination of breadth of view with the most precise
attention to details, he was unrivaled. When the Col
ton case was brought and followed by a trial for
which, outside of the Blythe contest, there are few
if any precedents, it was pithily remarked by the late
Hall McAllister that it was useless to attack a settle
ment that had passed under "the legal optics of Sam
uel M. Wilson and the financial orbs of Lloyd Tevis."
The traces of Mr. Tevis are. discernible in hundreds
of the heaviest transactions that mark the record of
the State and far beyond its boundaries, even into the
financial centers of Europe. His mental strength was
equaled by his working power, which appeared to be
almost unlimited. He was necessarily, both individ
ually and in his joint enterprises, an extensive em
ployer of labor, but the secret of his almost uniform
success was the fact that he paid the most rigid atten
tion to business, whether in his personal matters or Â«n
the affairs in which he filled a representative position.
He possessed absolute self-control and was never
swayed by passion or by any morbid element in his
character. In fact, his equanimity was as marked as
his ease and his freedom of movement, which at
traded general admiration.
The world is rarely just to men of great wealth. It
attributes to them a hardness of nature and a lack of
philanthropic feeling that in nine cases out of ten is
unjust. This is especially true of Mr. Tevis. While
he made no ostentatious donations, and his aspira
tions for posthumous honors can only be determined
by his will, there was hardly a public object of any
kind for which he could not be relied upon for a sub
scription, and the poor rarely applied to him unsuc
cessfully for help. After the Civil War, coming, as he
did, from a Southern State, his purse was always at
the service of that numerous class of intelligent and
refined men and women, who had been reduced to
poverty by the vicissitudes of battle, and yet retained
their personal sensitiveness. It was the habit of Mr.
Tevis to render his aid practically and without humil
iation. He would place the numerous persons in
whom he became interested either in salaried posi
tions or in occupations in which they could care for
themselves, and furnished them with the means they
preliminarily required. And it was observed of him
as of few other men. similarly placed, that he did not
grudge his personal services and that the prompt
fulfillment of his word, after he had once given it,
was certain.
There may be and there probably will be a diversity
of views upon the influence which Mr. Tevis, although
never a candidate for office, exercised in public
affairs. But. as one of the California pioneers, thor
oughly identified with the land of his choice, and
largely represented by his relatives and by his friends,
it will be generally conceded that his withdrawal from
our midst is a distinct loss to the community.
THE BROOKLYN STRIKE.
A CURIOUS story is current in New York to
the effect that the great strike on the lines of
the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company was due
primarily not so much to any discontent on the part of
the workingmen as to the instigation of certain par
ties who wished to bring about a strike for the pur
pose of affecting the price of the company's stock in
Wall street.
A story of that kind is of so improbable a nature
that strong evidence is required to sustain it. Mr.
Rossitcr, president oi the company, asserted it early
in the strike, and while admitting he had not evidence
enough to prove it in a court of justice, claimed to
have proof sufficient for a moral conviction of its
truth. Since then a good deal of outside testimony has
been added to that of Mr. Rossiter and the charge
appears to be well sustained.
According to the New York Tribune, the state
ment of Mr. Rossitcr is squarely, flatly and emphati
cally corroborated by Mr. Parsons, the general mas
ter workman of the Knights of Labor, who declares
himself ready to make some startling and convincing
revelations on the subject, while those against whom
the accusation is directed meet it not with the prompt
and indignant denial with which innocent men might
be expected to repel so foul an aspersion, but with
a cynical evasion which falls little short of an admis
sion of guilt.
An offense of the kind charged is so monstrous
that if there be anything like sufficient evidence to
maintain it, the matter ought to be made the subject
of something more than newspaper condemnation. If
unscrupulous brokers are going to instigate strikes
or other industrial disturbances for the purpose of
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, JULY 26, 1899.
promoting their stock speculations, the sooner we
have severe laws against such practices the better.
Mr. Rossiter, Mr. Parsons and the New York Tri
bune have a good deal of responsibility in the issue.
They have asserted the existence of an evil of the
most portentous nature, one which seriously con
cerns every great industry in the country, and it is
their duty to push the investigation and prosecute the
guilty parties if such can be found.
THE POLITICAL SITUATION.
THE displayed page in the Examiner in which it
savagely attacked Christopher Buckley is the
introduction to a controversy that may have
useful results. The blind leader, who now seeks to
rally his forces for a struggle with his former asso
ciates, may be justly amenable to the charges formu
lated against him. But he explains, contradicts and
retorts with a pithiness and with a force that must
have pierced the Examiner's cuticle and filled its pro
prietor and its editor with bitter exasperation.
The Call has no stomach for the details of these
malignant controversies between resuscitated bosses.
Against the entire boss system and against the brood
of corruptionists that represents the Huntington mo
nopoly, in all its phases, it has uniformly protested
and with a fair measure of success. Within the Re
publican organization the independence and the char
acter of its voters have been fully vindicated. Eighteen
Republican clubs have been organized and their ranks
are being filled by the best material in the party.
This is the pointed application of the representative
system to local politics that the new primary law was
intended to secure. It was a complete defeat of the
blanket proposition which is the only step toward the
revival of bossism that, on the Republican side, has
been attempted during the preliminary movements for
the approaching campaign. The aid of the Central
Republican Club .to insure the selection of unassail
able delegates to the municipal convention has not
been rejected, but, on the contrary, is strictly in line
with the very practical reform, of which such clear
evidences have been already furnished. If Mr. Z. U.
Dodge was correctly reported in yesterday's Exam
iner, he has very grossly and unnecessarily miscon
ceived the situation.
But the local attack of the Examiner on Christo
pher Buckley, in one of its aspects, deserves notice
Was it real or only a diversion? Buckley alone was
the subject of the local vituperation of the fusion
organ. What of Rainey and the forces allied with
him? Why were they not assailed? This must neces
sarily mean that, if there is a genuine fight on hand
between the two bosses, the sympathy and the influ
ence of the Examiner are with one as against the
other. The result is that the newspaper, which ha<?
appropriated Mayor Phelan and Assessor Dodge as
its patron saints, is working on the boss system. And
this view harmonizes with the local methods adopted
by the fusion Democracy last year and which it is
now proposed to perpetuate. The assertion of his
own individuality has filled the hat of Mayor Phelan
during his entire political career. In 1808 the fusion
clubs and forces of every V: id were ranged under his
banner and transacted their party business almost ex
clusively in his name. Recently separate Phelan clubs
have been formed in different parts of the city. The
Democratic County Committee is an oligarchy,
divested of any truly representative character. No
matter what sentimental declarations may be edito
rially expressed in the Examiner, the acts of the
fusion Democracy, from which that paper cannot sep
arate itself, are inconsistent with any true and inde
pendent selection of a convention or of candidates
and identify the party with the worst and most dan
gerous form of bossism.
The weak-hearted criticism of Rainey by the Ex
aminer, in which it compliments that dead light of
politics upon his practical wisdom in withdrawing
from any effort at manipulation, will deceive nobody.
Whether the raid on Buckley is sincere or hypocrit
ical, but for the editorial comment to which we have
alluded Rainey was left in peace. The opinion of
the public on the relations between him and the Ex
aminer, and through that medium, with the spotless
Mayor and the immaculate Assessor, will remain un
changed.
Municipally, unless folly unexpectedly regains influ
ence in the councils of the party, this is a Republican
year. The Call demands that all the pledges of the
last few weeks be fulfilled and that, both in its con
vention and in its ticket, the Republican organization
establish a new and wholesome precedent in San
Francisco.
OIL SPRINKLING FOR ROADS.
S~+ ONSIDERABLE attention has been given in
( the East to the recent incorporation under the
laws of Delaware of an organization known \%
the "Locomotive Smoke Preventive Company." It is
said to be made up of large capitalists and its object
is to acquire patents and manufacture devices for pre
venting smoke from railway locomotives and to en
courage economical operation of engines and small
consumption of coal.
The discussion which has followed the granting of
the franchise to the company has gone beyond the
question of smokeless locomotives to the wider fssue
of ridding American railway travel not only of the
smoke but of the dust that constitutes such an annoy
ance. As a suggestion to that end the New York
Times says:
"A few years ago a great and good man discovered j
that crude petroleum, evenly and liberally sprinkled
on the roadbed, was a permanent remedy for the twin
nuisance of surface dust, which had been only in part
abated by stone ballasting. This oil sprinkling is now
coming into general use. A railroad that does not
employ it owes an apology and reduced rates to its
passengers. With smokeless locomotives and an oil
coated roadbed railway travel would become luxu
riously comfortable, even in the nineties. Thousands
of persons ride on the open trolley cars on hot days
and nights to get relief from the heat. Steam rail
ways will be able to make their cars not less cool and
comfortable when the use of electric or other non
smoke-producing locomotives and oiled roadbeds
permit wide open doors and windows, and perhaps
special devices for cooling aeration."
It is perhaps too much to demand oiled roadbeds of
the railway companies in California, but the county
Supervisors might well profit by the suggestion.
Crude petroleum is comparatively cheap in California
and in some of our counties its value for road uses
has long been understood. There is no reason why
the use should not be made general over all roads
where there is a considerable amount of traffic. . It is
to be borne in mind that oil sprinkling means not
only an improvement of the highways for driving
purposes, but an economy in their preservation as
well.^,
Judging from the "work" of the Coroner and his
crew in the Florence Parker case, and with reference
to the Japanese sailors from the Nippon Maru, Hill
and his men are ready to find any old thing to suit
the circumstances of any old case. Another exposure
of their methods is imminent in the Wachcndorf trial.
TRICYCLE BUILT FOR A FAMILY.
The Warren family on wheels arrived last night at New Brunawlck. N. J., on
their way from Philadelphia to Vonkers. Mr. and Mrs. F. C. Johnson anu their
four little ones were happy and well, and the tricycle that bore them seemed as
clipper as the day it was built.
Although you might not think it from the tricycle's looks. Mr. Warren says
It makes himproud. He built it himself, and there is no other like it. Its base
Is an ordinary bicycle built for two. with an outrider fitted with a third wheel.
In the center is a box-, fitted with seats, wherein the little Warrens sit.
In this box also there is room for all the Warrens' clothes, a tent, blankets
and provisions. Over the box stretches an awning that serves to protect the
riders from sun and rain alike. All told, the entire machine weighs eighty-five
pounds and is geared up to forty-two.
The Warrens left Philadelphia Monday and expect to reach Yonkers Saturday
noon. In clear weather they have camped out, but during Wednesday's thunder
storm they had to take shelter in a farm housr.
Most of their riding is done in the morning and toward evening, and so far has
not proved w risome. The youngest child is a girl eighteen months old.
COMMUNICATIONS
AT THE GRAVE OF
ROBERT INGERSOLL
By the continual revolution in nature by
which pvery being and all mutter are
transformed, the body of Mr. Robert In
gersoil has succumbed to the unavoidable.
As he is now, he is still living by the
words he has uttered and action com
mitted and the seeds of mental progress
he has sown are still sprouting and blos
soming on and on, and the works he has
left to the world are as a concrete ped
estal supporting a column of wisdom and
mental tranquillity towering as a shining
beacon over his last resting place fpr the
guidance of the superstitious Into the
haven of enlightenment.
Truthful and honest in his opinions and
way of thinking, he made his mark and
left the grafted trees to buar a better
fruit. A mind free from superstition, liv
ing in the sunbeams of free thought,
shunning the reign of all that which tends
to envelop the human mentality with
doubt and darkness, he has liquidated his
obligations.
As the end of birth is the beginning of
death, he has made good use of the time
between the beginning and the end. Gifted
by nature with a superior mind, he ad
ministered well to the self-thinker. It
was. his natural calling to foster and sup
port the soaring of aii unshackled spirit
and loving disposition, undisturbed by any
influence of controversion and contradic
tion. He formed his own train of thoughts
to be piloted by him Into the â world to
light and progress. His spirit, thought,
words and action were not of a borrowed
character but Issued from a pure and un
trampled intelligence and understanding.
Being an issue of nature, he was not re
sponsible for his existence, but while liv
ing he well knew to distinguish between
the real and genuine and the imagin
ary and fictitious, never allowing his mind
to meandt r among the unfathomable. Ig
noring all that of which never a proof of
the fact of its existence has ever or can
ever be found, he was the searchlight for
veracity, truth and honest reality.
Barren of all superstition, with a char
acter that would revolt at the thought of
disloyalty to the laws of nature, his very
life blood would throb with emotion of
knowing of having paved and smoothed
the pathway to knowledge and an intelli
gent understanding, elevating science
against stubborn ignorance.
Although gone from where no kind
words, no good advice, can be heard, he
is not dismissed nor forgotten, but missed
by all intelligent solf-thinkers, and will
live on in the thoughts of the living by
the memorial of his labor, work and lit
erature instilled in the minds of his ad
mirers. M. P. SCHETZEL.

PRESS COMMENTS
A Promised Spectacle.
Los Angeles Times.
Here's richness. The notorious San Fran
cisco Examiner and the equally notorious
Sam Rainey, despite the fact that the
former has. in past seasons designated the
latter as a "political pariah" and a crea
ture that is unspeakably "infamous,"
have joined forces for the alleged purpose
of electing little Willie Hearst of New
York to the United States Senate from
California. Those who thought that thÂ«
utmost limit of political Indecency had
been reached when the attempt was made
to elect Dan Burns to the Senate now
have an opportunity to gaze on a per
formance which is at least deserving of
classification along with the one in which
the Mexican Colonel starred with such
conspicuous unsuccess. With the Demo
cratic boss from the purlieus endeavoring
to elect the Knight of the Silver Bathtub
and the Republican boss from the same
quarter working to elect himself to the
United States Senate, the State of Cali
fornia would be a sight to make antjels
weep, tear the feathers out of their wings
and otherwise exhibit disgust in carload
lots. But pause â just as likely as not the
people of California will have something
to say about these things.
Who Pays Commissioner Creelman?
San Diego Evening Tribune.
James Oreelman, who is a stench in the
nostrils of decent journalists, bobs up in
the columns of the San Francisco Exam
iner is a vilifier of General Otis. The
Examiner should get Aguinaldo's Junta to
vouch for Creelmah's twaddle. On the
face of his report it looks as if Filipino
money paid for the fellow's utterances.

were in ancient times dipped in crease
and used as a substitute for candles and
lamp wicks. In England it Is called

superstition that it was UBed by witches.

im- Bertha, orought down #10,000 worm
of gold dust. That much is certain. The
rest or" the treasure that the passengers
L-rougnt down is an unknown quantity,
â¢some value it at a million, while otners
go as high as a million and a half. Wil
liam M. Leggett was said to have brougnt
aown $ISO.<Â«Â»eJ, while the fact is he carried
a dratt ior ROO.OUO, and the amount ol
golu dust he brought along was known

down *MSO,UUU in treasure, George Demurs
$40,000, N. Mercier JtJO.L-yO, while "Jack"
McQuestin, "'the '.her of the Klon
dike," is said to nave brought out another
tortune.
Smith has been many years in the Klon
dike and is In the hotel business. He is X"
brother-in-law of Clarence Berry, and his
home is in Fresno. Mcuuestm lives in
North Berkeley, and he at once headed
in that direction as soon as the Steamer
docked. Whether the me- named brought
the sums put opposite their names Down
with them is not known for a certainty.;
it is simply the value placed on meir
wealth by the ship's crew. j
In regard to SoloojD Bay and Cane
Nome the accounts differ. Some of the j
returned Klondikers say the places arc
rich and others say they are not. Many
of those who say there is no gold at either j
place have never been there, while those j
who have been over the -ground say It
is rich. The Bertha made two trins be
tween Car>e Nome and St. Michael. On
the lirst trip she brought back a man ,
named Pierce, who had taken out twenty
three pounds of nuggets rom claim No.
8 on Anvil Creek in a day. The crew oF
the vessel all deserted and the passengers
had to assist the oflicers in getting the !
cargo ashore. On the flrst trip to Cape j
Nome the officers found about 500 people
there. When the Bertha went back a :
week later there were _>'*) men on the ,
ground and the crowd was still rushing â¢
in.
Nearly all the men who went to Kot_-^- .
bue Sound last year are either at Golovin j
Bay or Cape Nome. Last year they sent
an Indian out from the sound with 1500
letters, but instead of going on with the
mail he went back and reported the strike
at Nome and Golovin.' Nearly all the
gold hunters started out over the snow
and some of them suffered terribly. A
man named Rice and his party had to kill
and eat their dogs in order to preserve
their lives. As soon as the Ice broke up
the river steamer John Rr-iilv took all
the miners -he could carry to Cape Nome.
The .---. A ska was at Golovin Bay,
"round for Kotzebue. when the Bertha was
there, and she was to take away the re- ;
mainder of the miners from that place.
Golovin Bay Is In the same box as Cape
Nome as far as reports go. Some of the
returning miners say it Is rich and others
again condemn it. The fact of the matter
is that nothing will be known about
either place until the claims have Deen
worked and the returns come in. Every
inch of ground in both places has been
taken up. but so far very little gold has *
been taken out. as It has been impossible
to w-ork for want of fuel. This fault will
be remedied in a short time, and then it
will be known Just what the new diggings
are worth.
Among the passengers who came hack
on the Bertha without gold and only a
tale of suffering and death to tell was
Mrs. H. W. Benz of Clay City, Ky. She
and her husband went to Kotzebue Sound
and they had a terrible time of it. Mr.
Benz died of scurvy on May l."> and left
her alone. Three fishermen buried the
husband and marked his grave so that ,
if ever found it would be known who i
lay there. After many hardships Mrs. '
Benz reached Nuiato, where she was ]
taken care of by Father Ragura of the !
Catholic mission. He nursed her through \

FELL EIGHT STORIES
TO INSTANT DEATH
GEORGE SCHADE, a twelve
year-old newsboy, fell from
J the eighth floor 'of the Mills
-__,_ building to the basement yes
terday morning and was instantly
killed.
The boy fell from elevator No. 1,
in charge of Clarence Johnson, while
ascending between the eighth and the
ninth floors, the elevator door at the
time being open sufficiently to allow
the boy's body to fall through. Schade
went to work last Monday delivering
copies of the Daily Pacific Builder to
downtown subscribers. "He went over
the route on Monday with his pre
decessor. Floyd Brown of 136 Fulton
street, and on Tuesday morning he
took charge of the route himself.
Schade got on the elevator at S:3O
o'clock to deliver a copy of the paper
to a subscriber on the eighth floor.
On the elevator as passengers were

WERE LOST IN THE
REDWOODS OF MARIN
TWO ATTORNEYS, AN EDITOR
AND AN ACTOR BENIGHTED.
Families Were Much Worried Over
the Absence of the Quartet of
Pedestrians.
i .
The wires- of Marin County were kept j
hot all Sunday night and the morning of
Monday by the families and friends of
Otto Irving Wise and Marcus Rosenthal,
attorneys; A. W. Voorsanger. editor of the i
Emanuel and brother of the rabbi, and
Leo Cooper, the erstwhile comedian. They ,
were lost in the woods and for twenty
four hours wandered about without food.
making a bed of leaves around the,
warmth of an improvised log fire.
The party started from this city on
Saturday morning, intent upon a walking
trip to Bolinas and a return to Ross al
ley the following morning. They reached
Bolinas without mishap. After that their
adventures are a recital of, aching stom- :
achic voids and vain endeavors to find a |
trail which would lead them to a tele
graph station or a base of food supply.
On Saturday the quartet lunched at the
Redwood Grove and then began their
pedestrian tour. . They reached Willow
Camp and all was well. From that rest
ing place they tramped to the Summit
House on Bolinas Ridge, where they
stopped for the night.
With the rh*e of the sun the ambitious
pedestrians left the Summit House and
started down the canyon. Wise, with the {
recklessness of youth, advised the party
to forego the trail and follow a shorter
cut through the canyon. The rest agreed,
reiving upon the young attorney's su
perior knowledge in forestry matters.
That proved their undoing. All day they ,
wandered about, sometimes in circles, |
sometimes in spiral curves, without ever j
reaching a vantage ground from which
they might get their bearings.
The day dragged on hour by hour, and ,
the wailing, perspiring urban mountain
eers found themselves benighted. - All ,
their matches had been ruthlessly con- ;
sumed in the burning of tobacco. After j
a long search through his clothes Cooper, ,
j who had suddenly become a tragedian
under the stress of circumstances, found
the tip end of a parlor match. A log fire
was built, and, with a Hebrew incanta- \
tion by A. W. Voorsanger. the blaze be- :
gan to crackle. Wise was for prosecuting
the search for a telegraph office to notify \
his wife of his safety. He was overruled I
and the four silent watchers of the night
camped out. while craving stomachs as- c
serted their condition.
The next morning the lost pedestrians ;
followed the canyon until a trail was dis- ;
covered. Their original destination was
Ross Valley; they landed at Camp Tay- '
lor. The restaurants in that place have j
been scouring the country ever since for j
a renewal of supplies. : ;â ' .:.*::~

EVENING WEDDING
AT ST. JOHN'S
Nuptials of Charles C. Wil

'St. John's Presbyterian Church was the
scene of a pretty wedding last evening,
the contracting parties being Charles Cy

. Rev. George Eldredpe performed the Im
pressive ceremony. The church was elab
orately decorated with flowers and the
English and American flags.
The bride was attended by Miss Ruth
Colby, who officiated as maid of honor, i
and Miss Redman and Miss Anderson,
who acted' as bridesmaids. Mr. Hunter
was best man and Mr.- Talsk groomsman.
Two little maids picturesquely attired in
pink led the way to the altar strewing |
flowers along the bridal path. Fred Mc-
Kay carried the cushion on which rested
the wedding ring. :
The bride wore an elegant gown of white
satin. The bridal veil was confined to the
coiffure by a wreath of orange blossoms.
Miss Redman wore a dainty gown of â

out of the cage at the eighth floor
and Just as the cage was ascending
Schade tried to get out through the
door which had not been closed and
latched and his body was caught be
tween the floor of the cage and the
grill work. In another second the
body was rolled and crushed and then
fell to the cement basement one hun
dred feet below.
After the accident Johnson kept
away from the reporters, and Chief
Engineer Thomas Morrin barred out
the reporters and for a while even the
Deputy Coroners who came with the
Morgue wagon for the body. This pe
culiar and suspicious conduct on the
part of Morrin gave rise to a report
that a murder had been committed in
the building.
The elevator man is blamed for not
closing the door of the cage before
starting to ascend after having
stopped at the eighth floor, but the
defense is made by the attorneys for
the building that there Is not sufficient
time to do this without seriously in
terfering with the speed of the ele
vator, and that closing the door as the
case ascends Is sufficient precaution
against such accidents as that of yes

Louis Kirschbaum Refuses to Prose
cute Him for Assault to Murder.
The preliminary^ examination of Frank
McFarland. charged with assault to mur
der upon Louis Kirschbaum at the Branch
County Jail, was called in Judge Mo
han's court yesterday. Kirschbaum re
fused to swear to a complaint. The Judge
put him under oath and he frankly said
that he had no desire to prosecute the
case, although his life was in danger for
several weeks. He said he had no recol
lection of the assault, as his mind was a
perfect blank on the subject.
Owing to the circumstances the Judge
said he was puzzled to know what to do,
as without Kirschbaum's testimony there
was no case. He said he would take the
matter under advisement till July 28.

Determination to Carry On the Prose
cution of Welburn and His Two
Confidential Agents if They
Are Indicted.
In charging the new Federal Grand
I Jury yesterday morning United States
l District Judge de Haven made some re
marks which caused a sensation in the
! courtroom and actually gave an appear
j ance of life to the usual midsummer dull-
I ness In the Appraiser's building.
It was understood at once that the court
had requested the new Grand Jury to do
what . its predecessors had failed to ac-
I complish, namely, the indictment of W.
I H. Dlllard and Louis Loupe for their acts
: while engaged in the Internal Revenue of
; fice in this city during the administra
j tion of Osca M. Welburn.
It will be remembered that after the ac
quittal of Welburn on the first trial some
of the trial jurors said that they could not
convict Welburn so long as Dlllard and
Loupe were allowed to escape. On the
; second trial recently the jury disagreed
and several of the jurors stated there
would not be any difficulty in convicting
all three, but that they did not propose
to make, a scapegoat of the disgraced ex
; Collector. ;â : * ___ . .
Addressing the jury yesterday Judge de
i Haven charged them that it Was their
duty to examine Into and take the proper
' action on all violations of law. He called
.their attention particularly to section 5421
of the Revised Statutes, under which sec
tion Welourn was tried. The section deals
with the crime of "forging, altering, etc.,
documents with the Intent to defraud the
â¢ Government." '"'..* .__.Â«'â¢___
After reading the section in full. Judge
' de Haven called the particular attention
\ of the jurors to the affairs of the Internal
Revenue Office of the First District of
I California. Further than that the court
â¢ did not go. Immediately upon the dis
missal of the jury. United States District
Attorney Coombs visited Judge de Haven
â  in chambers and had a lengthy confer
' ence. The result of the conference was
that Mr. Coombs decided' to bring the
1 cases of Dlllard and Loupe at once before
the Grand Jury. Burt M Thomas, special
. internal revenue j agent, was afterward
closeted with Mr. Coombs for an hour
1 on the same matter. _11- :
After the conference Mr. Thomas said
to a reporter that he had presented the
cases of Dlllard and Loupe before the
same Grand Jury that indicted Welburn
and that the jury had failed to Indict
th"m. Those jurors had informed him
that they would not Indict Dlllard and
c Loupe unless Welburn were convicted.
"I have the evidence." added Mr.
; Thomas, "and I am prepared to present
it to the Grand Jury at any time. I will
Five, them all the facts and details that
can." â  ; . ' . : V r
United States District Attorney Coombs
1 Â«aid- "I propose to carry out faithfully,
1 technically and justly everything that
'. will facilitate the work of the jury in
(compiling with the instructions of. the
I court. Inasmuch as these instructions
; have been given by the court, I shall,
: of mv own motion, present the matter to
the Grand Jury. With regard to Mr. Wei*
burn's case. I will say that if the acces
â¢ sories are to be prosecuted justice should
surely require that the principal should
; be prosecuted also."

Supervisors Keep Their Pledge and
Set Aside $30,000 for the Pur
pose Money Due for De
cember, April, June.
A hundred and odd laborers who have ,
been working without pay for the Street ;
Department, merchants with miscellane- ;
ous claims against the city and warrant
brokers who have been buying up at half {
their face dubious claims dating from De- i
cember last, were all relieved of their
worries yesterday by the announcement
by Auditor Wells that labor and mer
chandise claims for December and April ;
and merchants' claims for June would all
be payable at the Treasurer's office after I
10 o'clock this morning. Mr. Wells will
have them ready at that hour.
The December claims have been consid
ered as so much lost by both laborers
and merchants since January 1. Even
the warrant brokers who as a general
thing do not overlook any bets when it
comes to discounting a city claim, have
been refusing to accept either December
or April bills for the past month. The
contracts upon which the city had bought
labor and supplies were all in excess of
the one-twelfth provision that binds the
departments, and Auditor Wells refused
to audit in excess of it.
Mr. Wells refused solely in the line of
his duty and for no other reason. . He ,
laid the matter before the Supervisors in I
an effort to find some relief for the city's
creditors, and as a result the Supervisors
recently pledged themselves to set aside
from some other fund $35,000 to meet the
demands. They made their promise good
by transferring $30,000 from the street- I
lighting to the street fund when they met
on Monday. This amount, to the
$811 received from the Sutro road, its
2 per cent contribution from its annual I
gross receipts, warranted the Auditor in j
opening up the treasury to back claims.
Early next week the Market-street Rail- j
way Company will pay In to the treasury
just a little short of $10,000 as its annual â¢
contribution, and this amount will be used I
In paying oft* the Street Department labor
claims for June. The December claims
unpaid amount to $15,733 58, the April
claims and June merchants' claims to I
$18,384 46.

A BOY CAST ADRIFT.
Louis Jordan Sent From Tuolumne
County hy His Adopted Mother.
Louis Jordan, a homeless boy 10 years
of age. will be an inmate of the City
Prison until he Is sent to some charitable
institution or until those who have aban
doned him are compelled to take â¢ him
back. He is a bright, intelligent boy,
whose life has not been a bed of roses.
Seven years ago he was taken from an
asylum at Laundry Farm by Mrs. James
Burch of Tuttletown. Tuolumne County.
She was then a Mrs. Jordan, and pave
him her husband's name. Since his adop
tion he has been compelled to work about
the house, and at rare intervals was per
mitted to go to school. A year ago, when
his adopted mother got married to James
Burch,- a miner, the boy was cast adrift,
but a neighbor took him In and treated
him kindly. Mrs. Burch, finding that he
was being well cared for, took him back.
On Monday last the boy was again cast
adrift and was brought to this city by
Henry Sopher. a cook, who was on his
way to Santa Cruz. Sopher got enough
money from Mrs. Burch to pay for the
boy's fare to this city, and when they ar
rived yesterday morning the boy was
turned over to the police.

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW â¢ YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW. YORK. July 25.â stock market
continued well nigh lifeless to-day, only a few
Stocks showing any movement of price worthy
of note. The movement was so narrow and
sluggish that it was difficult at times to dis
tinguish the tendency of prices; Rock Island
showed an opening gain of %. while St. Paul
opened down % St. Paul was not influenced
at all by the statement of earnings in the
third week, which again broke all previous
records. The market was heavy all day and
was the only one of the granger group which
hung below last night's level for most of the
day. Late In the day there was an Increased
demand for Rock Island, which lifted Its price
about a point above last night's level. The
Southwestern rose at the same time over a
point each. lowa Central also continued to ad
vance. There was a period of midday strength |
In the Pressed Steel Car stocks, which rose I
34 arid 24 respectively. A simultaneous move- j
ment, apparently sympathetic, affected Na
tional Steel and' Tennessee Coal and Tin J*late, j
-and later the American Hoop stock rose 2%
and 1% respectively. None of these gains was
fully held, and, on the other hand, American j
Smelting and Colorado Fuel showed sharp de
clines. General Electric was advanced to
1244. but reacted a point. The serious aspect I
at Cleveland of the street car strike had rather
a depressing effect on the market. The day's
business was close to the lowest level of the |
year.
The bond market was dull and irregular, ex* j
cept for a large absorption of St. Louis South
western seconds. Total sales, par value, $1,710,
--000. United State* new 4's registered declined

CHICAGO -GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, July 25.â An estimate of 225,000,
--i 000 bushels as the probable yield of the spring
I crop In Minnesota and the two Dakotas started
j wheat rather easy. September opened %c lower
i at 70%@70%c, advanced slowly to 70% c, then
! declined to 70% c. A report from Paris that the
1 French crop this year would equal that of a
â¢ year ago had a depressing Influence during the
I first two hours' trading. After that, however,
: the market took a sudden upturn and continued
*t*.ror}g until the close. â  September advanced to
'71 %c and closed at 71%@71%c. The change of
sentiment was brought about by a flood of
damage reports from the Northwest, some of
them placing the. Injury already done spring
wheat at 20 to 25 per cent. The smallness. of
primary Western receipts, amounting to only
675,000 bushels, was also an inspiration to the
bulls to-day, for the first time in several weeks
b'elns less than for the same day last year.
Liquidation, owing to heavy receipts, weakened
corn, but the loss was more than recovered
' later by buying against puts in -sympathy with
the advance In wheat. Crop reports were less
': promising than heretofore and country offer
. ings extremely small. September closed with
\ a gain of %c. . ;<:Â»'.*"-â .:-
Oats followed other grains, opening at the
j low point, and' closing at the top. Reports
1 from various sections say that the new crop
i Is running^ to straw. September gained %c.
Provisions opened firm, but collapsed under
1 free' selling by packers and commission houses.
This latter selling was principally on stop-loss
: orders. Part of the' decline was recovered in
; sympathy" with the advance In grains. Pork

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, July 25.
The matrimonial path of Joseph Board- .
man, the aged millionaire, who last month
led pretty 17-year-old Blanche Louise j
Walk to the altar as his bride, is now
thickly strewn with a multiplicity of
thorns and family tribulations. Within
the past four weeks a world of sorrow
lias been added to the eccentric man's ;
burdens.
Shortly after the May and December
nuptial affair, which created a decided '
sensation, troubles began brewing be- '
tween the aged benedict and his mother
in-law. Mrs. E. E. Walker, over the re
moval of shrubbery and trees and pet j
ornaments from his garden about his
residence on Eighth street, it being |
claimed that Mrs. Walker had acted too J
officiously in hiring a gang of men to
clear the place without consulting the j
owner, her .-in-law.
Soon after followed another sensation j
in the way of a suit brought by Mrs.
Elizabeth Glads a San Francisco .
widow, who demanded $300,000 damages as
balm for her lacerated affections, she I
alleging a breach of promise and relating
a story of how she had been jilted for i
the pretty Oakland school girl.
This suit is said to have so gnawed at
the sensitiveness of the aged capitalist
that ie knew not whither to turn for ad- i
vice, for he had severed his business re
lations with those who prior to the sur
prise marriage had managed his affairs,
and in his despair â it is claimed ley the
mother-in-lawâ he resorted to William
Anderson, his gardener, for advice; while .
others divine that the mother-in-law has
risen in all her might and usurped the !
throne of adviser. Either way the result
has been disastrous and responsible for !
the latest sensational chapter in Mr. {
Boardman's troubles, which was enacted
at tjiu Central Bank a few days ago,!
wherein the lie was passed between j
Banker W. G. Palmenteer and Dr. C. D.
Cleveland; a prominent physician of San
Francisco, who had come to Oakland
ostensibly to protect the Interests of his '
old friend. Mr. Boardman.
It appears that some one, either Gar- â 
dener Anderson or Mrs. Walker, the mother
in-law. had advised Boardman to deed all
his property to his young bride to protect
it from the possible encroachments of
Mrs. Gladstone, the suing widow. Mr. |
Boardman had been finally prevailed upon ,
to_do this, and the -in-law, so it is |
ssfh-nised. was once more triumphant, 1
but Mr. Boardman decided to first consult
his banker. Mr. Palmenteer. What fol
lowed is best told by Mrs. Walker:
"Mr. Boardman tame back from the ]
bank," said Mrs. Walker, "and told us
that Messrs. Palmenteer and Havens at I
the bank had advised .m not to deed |
away his property. Something was said
about a conspiracy and all that, but I
can't see why It's any of the banker's
business if Mr. Boardman wants to give
his wife his property to protect it from I
Mrs. Gladstone.
Well; Dr. Cleveland happened to be at !
our house the other day. He is an old '.
friend of Mr. man's, and BO after J
â¢we ail talked it over my -in-law and !
the doctor, together with Attorney George ;
De Golia, went to the bank again and de
manded the deeds. Messrs. I 'almenteer i
and Havens would not give them up.
"Oh, 1 am so mad 1 could fight. Just j
think. Those bankers wouldn't give Mr. '
Boardman the deeds ha belong to him. j
It's all a lie that I tried to Induce him
to deed his property to his wife, my !
daughter. Why pshaw! It was all tnc
doings of his hired man, William Ander- j
son. Boardman had been running over
to the city to see whether he couldn't
quash Mrs.. Gladstone's suit and it seems I
did not succeed, nd so Anderson told
him that if he deeded everything to hi.3 '
wife, why Mrs. Gladstone would get noth- i
ing."
From other sources it is learned thct
when Boardman, 'Attorney De Golia, the
bride |nd her mother visited the bank the
â¢'banker frankly admitted that his friend
Mr. Boardman had asked him for some
advice and that he had given him the ;
truth of the Iter, whereupon Mrs. Wal
ker proclaimed thai she aid "not pro
pose to see her daughter robbed," and
that "Boardman ought to sign the deeds
to protect her."
Banker Palman-teer, however, tried to
soothe matters by apprising Mrs. Wal
ker of the fact that the daughter would !
probably get the property when Mr.
Boardman dies. Attorney De Golia but
mired thai the aged capitalist might
make a will and cut his wife out. to
which the banker assented "He might."
At any rate Mr. Boardman would not
Fign. and the quintet left the bank cha
grined.
During the consultation at the bank Dr. !
Cleveland, it appears, had urged the
banker "to hand over the deeds and
straighten out matters." to which the :
hanker replied with the question: "If you
were Mr. Boardman's brother would you i
really advise him to deed the property j
ns you suggest?" >:-. Cleveland re- j
snondine affirmatively, the banker Ques
tioned his sincerity, whereupon the doctor
parsed the lie "nr-d by some it is said i
was promptly ejected.
FEAR FRANK LEGEORGE
HAS BEEN KIDNAPED!
OAKLAND, July 2.".â Frank Legeorge, j
an orphan, -aged 15 years, has been miss- j
ing from the ranch of Robert Lowry,
near Llvermore, the past week, and no j
trace of him can be found. The boy was ;
.taken from the orphan asylum at San
Rafael about five years ago and adopted j
by a woman who resides In San Fran- ]
cisco. Three years ago she placed the â 
lad with Lowry to train him as an agri

THE SAN FEAJS CISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, JULY 26, 1899.
WILLARD FIELD
NEARLY KILLS A
POLICE OFFICER
Wild Ride Through
Alameda's Streets.
â4
HE TERRORIZED THE CITY
â t, â
SHOT INTO HOMES OF THE SLEEP
ING CITIZENS.
â¦
When Officer Welch Attempted to
Stop Him He Fired Twice at the
Policeman's Head, Shat
tering His Hat.
ALAMEDA, July 25.â residents of
Alameda throughout the center of town
were plunged into a state of terror be
tween 2 and 3 o'clock this morning by the
insane antics of H. Willard Field, a young
society man and member of a prominent
Alameda family. He rode through the
City at breakneck speed on a steed with
out saddle or bridle, controlled only by a
halter rope, discharging a pistol at the
homes of the slumbering people, yelling
like a madman.
The whole night force of the Alameda
Police Department attempted to round up
the young man, and when Officer Dennis
Welch finally headed him off the lunatic
fired two shots at the policeman at close
range. Field eluded the police until 5
o'clock In the morning, when he was ar
rested by Officers Brampton and Law
rence as he was peacefully sleeping In his
room at his father's home, 717 Paru
street.
The Police Department for some un
known reason made a determined effort to
protect the man who had nearly mur
dered one of its members. Everything
possible was done to keep the facts from
the newspapers, and Field was assisted
by them to freedom and nominal punish
ment. Some members of the force are in
dignant at the leniency shown Field, and
the public severely condemn the officials
for their action in the matter.
H. Willard Field is the third son of H.
K. Field, ex-Yosemlte Valley Commis
sioner and coast manager of the New
England Mutual Life Insurance Company.
Field Sr. is away in the country, and Wil
lard took advantage of his absence to in
dulge In a night of the wildest revelry
with a party of three companions. Early
Monday evening they hired a carriage at
a local livery stable and visited the way
side resorts along the San Leandro road,
returning to Alameda about midnight.
The quartet then repaired to the Field
mansion and had soon drained of their
contents the bottles of liquor on the side
board and consumed much wine that was
stored in the cellar.
It is presumed that this occupied their
time until about 2 o'clock this morning,
for at that time the lights in the house
were extinguished. What happened Im
mediately afterward is not known, but
at 2:30 o'clock three pistol shots startled
the neighborhood of Morton street and
Central avenue, many blocks away from
the Field residence. This was followed
by a crashing of glass, a series of demon
like yells and the noise of a horse's hoofs
as it galloped along Central avenue.
The man's arms were waving above his
head and the bright barrel of a revolver
could be plainly discerned shining in the
moonlight.
Officer Lawrence, who was patrolling
that section of the city, gave chase, but
the mad horseman easily distanced him.
The sound of the galloping horse died
away in the distance and the town pre
pared to resume its slumbers when two
more shots rang out in the vicinity of
Union street and Clinton avenue, nearly
a mile away from the scene of the first
disturbance. It was here that Officer
Welch started on the chase. He ran in
the direction from which came the sound
of the shots, but had covered but little
ground when another report came from
the direction of Walnut street and San
Antonio avenue. By this time the whole
night patrol was alarmed and running
through the streets in an effort to locate
the pistol wlelder.
When Welch reached San Jose avenue
and Willow street Field dashed by him
riding in the direction of Park street. The
officer shouted to him to stop. The answer
was two shots fired In the air. At Park
street and San Jose avenue the pistol
popped twice more. Riding across Park
street to Broadway Fields met Officer
Keyes, who tried to head him off. He
had to dodge three bullets for his effort
to stop the young man in his wild career.
There' was no more ' firing for at least
ten minutes. Field had stopped occasion
ally to reload his revolver and, according
to the belief of the police, it was emptied
for the second time when It was dis
charged at Keyes. At 2:50 o'clock Officer
Welch, who had returned to Central ave
nue and Lafayette street, heard a horse
coming up the avenue from the direction
of Grand street. Field had doubled back
on his pursuers and was again in the vi
cinity of where he had started on ais
escapade. The horse had been badly used
up and was moving slowly when it came
up to Welch. The officer recognized the
rider and, stepping in front of the ani
i mal, spoke to young Field.
"Hold on. Field, I want you, said
Welch, at the same time reaching for the
halter rope. '_ â
"You don't come any of that on me,
was Field's answer, and almost instantly
he leveled his revolver at Welch, who
was but a few feet away, and fired twice.
The first shot nearly grazed the officer
ear. The second went through the crown
of his hat, ranging downward and cutting
the rim. missing Welch's head by less
than an inch. '
The policeman was stunned for a.mo
ment by the Concussion and thought the
top of his head had been shot away.
When he pulled himself together and
drew his pistol Field had wheeled his
horse about and was again galloping down
the avenue, shooting right and left until
every chamber in his weapon had been
emptied. The officer took a shot at the
fleeing horseman, but the bullet failed to
reach him. ' _ '
Welch went to police headquarters,
where he was seen shortly after his ar
rival by a Call correspondent. He was
badly scared and hardly able to talk. He
professed ignorance of any shooting, de
nied that a bullet had gone through his
hat or that he knew the identity of the
man who had awakened Alameda from its
slumbers at such an unseemly hour. It
! was not until late in the afternoon, after
I the efforts of the police to suppress the
I truth had failed, that he consented to
talk. _ , . .
Officers Brampton and Lawrence found
, Field at his father's house sleeping off
! the effects of his carousal. At the police
station Sergeant Kamp insisted upon
booking him on the felony charge of as
sault with intent to commit murder. Some
â¢ peculiar work was done at once. Chief
| of Police Conrad was soon in consultation
with influential friends and relatives of
the prisoner, with the result that Officer
Welch was not permitted to prefer the
felony charge. He was allowed, however,
to swear to a complaint before Justice of
the Peace Morris charging Field with dis
turbing the peace, and another before
Recorder St. Sure charging him with vio
lating a city ordinance which prohibits
the discharge of firearms within the city
limits. To both of these charges he plead
ed guilty and was fined $20 in each case.
His relatives at once spirited him out of
the city.
During his ride Field sent bullets Into
houses along the route taken, smashing
windows and doing other damage. Sev
eral of the missiles nearly hit the sleeping
occupants of the houses.
QUEEN'S EYESIGHT IMPROVED
LONDON, July 25.â Truth says to-day:
The Queen has been undergoing a course
of treatment for ten weeks for her eyes,
as advised by Professor Pagensteicher of
Weisbaden, and I am rejoiced to say with
the most successful result.
The Queen's eyesight Is no longer in
danger and an operation will be unneces
sary. Her Majesty now wears powerful
glasses of unusually large size and with
black rims, which were ordered by Pro
fessor Pagensteicher. and when she is
obliged to use artificial light she prefers
a shaded wax candle.

PREPARING FOR THE
BOYS' HOMECOMING
EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE ROOMS
OPEN AT THE CALIFORNIA.
Planning for the largest Parade
Ever Seen on the Streets of
San Francisco.
Having accepted the offer of General
Warfleld to allow the executive commit
tee of the joint committee of
the Native Sons and Daughters who
are preparing the reception of the Califor- ;
nia boys from Manila rooms in the Cali
fornia as headquarters, the rooms as
signed for that purpose were taken pos
session of yesterday by Grand Marshal
Pistolesi and Henry I. Fisher, who will
be in charge of them every day from 9
in the morning till noon, and from 1 in
the afternoon until 5 o'clock, and if It be
comes necessary some one will be there all
the time.
The first duty that was undertaken yes
terday was the preparing of about 750 in
vitations under the direction of the com
mittee appointed at the meeting held last
Monday night. The list will include every
society of whatever character, that the
committee can learn the name of, and i
there will be invitations to Federal, State ,
and city officials, to foreign Consuls and .
to officers of the army and navy. It is j
the desire of the committee that the pa- I
rade, which is to be held on the day fol- I
lowing the arrival of the fighters of the
Golden State, shall be the largest that has
ever been planned in this city.
The suggestion that was made in the
National Guard column of The Call last
Sunday has been taken up by the com- ]
mittee, and it is likely that the several
companies of the Fifth Regiment of In
fantry, which forms part of the Second ,
Brigade, to which the California First be
longs, will be furnished transportation
from the following points, where the com
panies are located: A at Oakland; B, ,
San Jose; C, Petaluma; D San Rafael, E.
Santa Rosa; F. Oakland: G. Alameda; H. |
Napa, to enable these guardsmen to greet
their fellow-soldiers on their return. The
Signal Corps of the Second Brigade will, |
as well as Troop A, cavalry, take part
in the reception. _ ,
A feature that the committee has under
consideration is the placing of
all the public school children
by schools along the line of march
provide them with flags to wave and
flowers to shower- on the heroes as they j
march past. And it is probable that an ,
effort will be made to have the children of ,
private schools do likewise. Â«_-*â
The subject of having appropriate floats |
in the parade has been discussed in some |
of the parlors of the Native Sons and of
the Native Daughters, but as i yet no defi- |
nite conclusion has been reached still it is j
thought that some will be Introduced -,^_ j
The Exempt Firemen, whose headquar- ,
ters are on Brenham place, and the as
sociation known as Sons of Exempts as
well as the Association of Veteran Fire- {
men, who have their headquarters In the
Pioneer building, will turn put with the
trappings of the days "of old, and each I
organization will man the ropes of appa
ratus that was in vogue when the volun
teer system was in operation in this city.
The- Naval Militia will also form part
of the great turnout, as light batteries
with rapid-firing guns.
Joseph W. Hughes of Sacramento,
erand chief ranger, and John J. Cord*. ,
grand secretary of the Foresters of Amer
ica wil 1 issue a circular to-day to all
the courts of the jurisdiction calling at
tention to the noble deeds of the soldiers
in the recent war as expressed in a resolu
tion adopted at the last held Grand Court
session In Santa Clara and winding up in
the following appeal: these resolutions
â¢'ln accordance with these resolutions
you are requested to appoint a committee
of three from your court to attend a meet
ing to be held Tuesday evening, August 8,
18Â», in the committee room, third floor.
Alcazar building. ISO O'Farrell street. San
Francisco, for the purpose ot^devUUlS
ways and means to give the First Cali
fornia Regiment, United States Volun
teers, a fitting reception and welcome on
their return from Manila."
McGOVERN CALLED A TRAITOR.
Disturbed Political Conditions in the
Twenty-Eighth Reach a Climax.
The disturbed political conditions in the
Twenty-eighth District reached a climax
last night at the meeting of the regular
district club at Armory Hall, corner of
Second and Folsom streets, when John J.
Greeley took the platform and Introduced
a resolution branding John J. McGovern
as a traitor and reading him out or the
The resolution was unanimously adopt
ed but back of Greeley's unexpected
move there is quite an interesting story.
When the Commltte of One Hundred or
ganized a club in the Twenty-eighth Dis
trict some weeks ago under the leader
ship of J. D. Maxwell and John J. Ferris,
McGovern, Greeley and Assemblyman
Eugene Lacy created a rival club. The
political pot simmered antJ boiled between
the two rival organizations, but during
tire latter part of last week the repre
sentatives of the two clubs sat down to
gether and settled their differences. A
compromise was agreed upon and they
decided to consolidate the two organiza
tions. At the last minute McGovern noti
fied Ferris and Maxwell that his organ
ization had decided against consolidation.
Accordingly McGovern called a meeting
of the club, but Greeley and Lacy, who
seem to have the entire following of the
club, marshaled their supporters and
brought them over last night to the feast
of consolidation. â¢
It is now rumored that McGovern In
tends to join hands with Larry Conlon,
who represents Buckley's interests in the
Twenty-eighth.
â  â¦ â 
Democrats in the Twenty-Eighth.
The Democrats of the Twenty-eighth
Assembly District held a high jinks last
night at Third and Hunt streets. The
Buckley element was largely in evidence,
and speeches were made by James Bow
lan, Thomas Egan. Dr. Loryea and R.
Porter Ashe approving the policy of the
Buckley regime. Bowlan in his talk said
that the Examiner would hereafter keep
its literary hands off Mr. Buckley for its
own welfare. The enrollment committee
reported a total membership of 340. At
the end of the regular meeting short ad
dresses and songs were given by Walter
Curley, Dan Maloney. J. Collins and John
D. Condon.

PRIZE FOR A POSTER.
The Mechanics' Institute has gone in for
the poster fad. The board of directors
decided last night to offer a prize for
the poster accepted for the coming fair.
All the posters submitted in competition
are to be placed on exhibition.
To givo the public a chance to say what
sort of public improvement it most de
sires Curtis Tobey Jr.. a member of the
institute, sent the board a communica
tion suggesting that every architect and
civil engineer in San Francisco be invited
to submit plans in competition for some
public improvement, the prize to b_
awarded to the specifications receiving
the largest public vote during the fair.
The suggestion will probably be adopted.
The University of California sent sev
eral letters to the effect that it will 1 aye
an exhibit at the fair. It is probable
that the art exhibit made at the National
Educational Convention will be part of
this exhibit, as well as designs from the
College of Mechanical Arts.
Th- United States War Department no
tified the institute that the old wooden
cannon captured by the Twenty-third
United States Infantry near Malolos In
the Philippines would be at the institute's
service whenever desired. This cannon is
made of a piece of gaspipe driven into
a log. the log then being bound around
with hoops.

SOLDIERS RUN AMUCK
ON BARBARY COAST
WIDESPREAD TERROR CAUSED
BY KRAG-JORGENSENS.
James Cassin and John Beach Escape
From Transport Tartar While
Drunk and Abuse Citizens
on the Street.
Two soldiers who ran amuck on the
Barbary Coast early yesterday morning
narrowly escaped being responsible for a
murder before the*.* were landed in the
California-street station by the police.
Both were scheduled to sail on the trans
port Tartar on Sunday night, but before
the vessel left the wharf th&y changed
their plans for. the Manila trip, and,' se
curing two loaded Krag-Jorgensen rifles,
escaped, hatless and coatless, to shore and
immediately became the terrors of the
dance halls and saloons on the Barbary
Coast. About 2:30 yesterday morning
they landed In a saloon on the first floor
of the Prescott House at 933 Kearny
street. Both were drunk, and after driv
ing every one from the place one of them
discharged his rifle at the ceiling over
head. The bullet passed through several
boards into a room occupied by Gustav
Welman, who conducts a jewelry store at
622 Merchant street. In tearing its way
through the floor of the upper room it
struck a gas pipe and glanced. Had the
missile continued in a straight path it
would probably have killed the jeweler.
After deserting the Tartar the soldiers,
whose names are James Cassin and John
Beach, entered saloon after saloon, in
each place driving out the occupants and
threatening life. While on the street they
prodded pedestrians with their bayonets
.- nd usually had the sidewalk to them
selves. In several houses they smashed
whatever they got their hands on and
tore the blinds from a building on Mont
gomery avenue.
When the shot was fired they again
started on their rampage, but were met
by Police Officers Peters and Cavanaugh,
who had been detailed to round up the
murderous soldiers. When the officers ap
proached both of the men made motions
as if to shoot should any attempt be made
to arrest them. By strategy the officers
succeeded in getting close enough to the
fellows to seize their weapons. A struggle
commenced and the soldiers, disarmed of
their rifles, reached for knives which they
carried in their belts. Officer Cavanaugh
quickly subdued his man, but Peters was
not co fortunate with his. The scuffle
with the latter was long, during which
the soldier made repeated efforts to get at
his knife. At length Special Officer Dag
gett and several citizens came to the of
ficer's assistance and soon had the culprit
handcuffed. _ .
At .he police station Cassin was recog
nized as the man who did the shooting
and in addition to being booked for dis
turbing the peace he has a charge of dis
charging firearms within the city limits
placed against his name. Beach will have
to stand trial for disturbing the peace
The military authorities were notified
yesterday and will take action on the
disgraceful conduct of the soldiers. Of
ficer Peters visited the Presidio and laid
the matter before the authorities.
GOING TO PARIS TO
SECURE HEADQUARTERS
C. L.. P. Marais, a well-known local
newspaper man, was appointed assistant
secretary and commercial representative
of the California commission to the Paris
Exposition at a meeting of that body yes
terday at the Occidental Hotel. The ap
pointment was made on the recommenda
tion of Raphael Weill, the presidents of
the different French banks and leading
members of the French colony.
Mr. Marais will leave for Paris on the
15th of next month to procure headquar
ters in the business portion of that' city
and to generally look after the business
of the commission until it arrives.
The Southern Pacific has hit upon a co
lossal advertising scheme. It will erect
a building of its own at the Paris expo
sition, where will be exhibited the re
sources of such portions of the State as
are tapped by its various lines. For this
purpose the company has set aside ; the ;
sum of $50,000, and its expenditure has
been placed in the hands of W. H. Mills, |
who will superintend the scheme.
INTERRED WITH HONORS.
Dr. H. R. Morton Sr., the pioneer den
! tist, who died on Saturday last, was buried
at Laurel Hill Cemetery yesterday after
c noon under the auspices of Hesperian
I Grove No. 13 of the Order of Druids. In
I compliance with the wishes of the de

â  but the services of his order were read
i at Druids' Hall by Past Noble Grand H.
.1. <;cl!er. who concluded by paying an elo
quent tribute to the memory of the de
parted.
The funeral Was largely attended by
Pioneers and their families. Floral trib-
u tes were heaped in rich profusion around
; the casket. A floral pillow of large size
came from Hesperian Grove: a broken
i wheel was from the sons of the deceased
and scores of bouquets and other pieces
came in m friends. Dr. Morton was one
jof the best known men on the coast. He
! came here in 1846 and entered into the
practice of his profession. He was a
prominent factor in political and fraternal
! circles.
SAY HE WAS INSANE.

seph M. Wood has been assailed, and a
lengthy and bitter legal battle will oc

tribution of the estate is made. Yesterday
afternoon the children of the deceased
capitalist filed a contest to the will, on
the ground that the deceased was of un
sound mind when he affixed his signature.

Death of H. C. Lambert.
One more of the number who arrived In
Yerba Buena in 1849 has passed away.
This time the telegraph announces the
death of Henry C. Lambert at \Ve=>t New
ton, Mass., on the 18th Inst, at the age of
87 years. The deceased was born In Eng

where he was ordained a minister of the
Unitarian church. .
Previous to hig leaving Massachusetts
in 1849 he fitted out two vessels for the
Golden Gate, one of which was the Dux
bury, and which put into Bolinas, which
circumstance gave to the reef at that
place the name of Duxbury Reef. Be
sides his widow, who is now S3 years of
age, and several grown-up sons and
daughters, the deceased leaves a brother,
Charles Lambert, a resident of Oakland,
to mourn his demise.
