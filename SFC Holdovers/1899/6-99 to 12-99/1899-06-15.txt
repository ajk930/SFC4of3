Under New Jersey Laws.
Pp~o!al li'.spatrh to The Call.
NEW YORK. June 14.â Wall street
: was filled yesterday with rumors of a
! dissolution of the Standard Oil Com
pany and the possible formation of ."a
new company under the laws of New
Jersey in which the objectionable feat-'
I ures which resulted in the adverse ac-
I tion of the Ohio courts could be done
; away with. It was reported that $300
in cash and two shares of the new
, stock were to be given for each of the
: outstanding certificates, and hence the
! old issues, it was floured, would be
worth about $500 each. It was said
that a meeting of the trustees will be
1 held to-morrow for the purpose of set
tling the details of the new company.
According to experts, it has been evi
dent for several days that something
has been under way, but the nature of
the deal has been carefully concealed.
An official has. however, admitted that
the trustees have decided to go ahead
and wind up in short order the affairs
of the trust, as heretofore directed by
the Ohio courts.
It is n<nv expected this work will be
done Inside of a few months. This samp
official denied that a new trust is to
be organized In New Jersey or any
othr-r State. The trustees, he said,
have no Intention of pursuing consoli
dation and expansion principles in op
position to publii sentiment. He paid
thru, what is to be done is t>> wind up
th" trust as rapidly as possible. He
also made a statement that the assets
of th r - trust have been about two-thirds
liquidated. If. therefore, the original
value of the certificates outstanding
was $95.ftÂ°". 0(l<1 they would now amount
to. according to this statement, less
than $32,000,W0. When he was asked
about the big extra dividends thai have
been paid at frequent Intervals in ad
dition to the regular 3 per cenl quar
terly dividends, the official Bald these
extra payments represented an actual
division of assets. He declined to make

â¢ Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, June 14.â 1n the j
cold, half-light of early morning
to-day, In a South Broadway
lodging-house, was enacted the
final scene of the old. gloomy
tragedy of a marriage that failed.
The husband, a vain, irresponsible,
character boy of twenty, crept
from the side of his sleeping girl wife
and took from 'a ante! a bottle of
chloroform. Behind him lay their baby,
less than a month old, asleep on a sofa
pillow Th, fumes of the drug applied ;
to the pale girl's nostrils deepened her
sleep beyond the possibility of acci
dental awakening. The murderer was
sure of his purpose and drew from be
hind him a shining revolver. The wife
lay on her right side, with her face to
the wall arid her back toward the boy
husband. A shot was fired and the
young w.#man. her night garments
stained with blood and powder marks,
rolled upon her back, spoke once or
twice and died. The baby woke up and
whimpered feebly, its tiny arms beat
ing the air. The murderer walked a
few feet from the bed and placing the
still smoking revolver to his body fired ;
a bullet through his abdomen. He fell j
to the floor, fatally wounded and was
: found, writhing in agony, by the peo
pie that rushed to the scene.
Earl M. Hanehette, aged 20 years,
this morning shot â¢and instantly killed
his eighteen-year-old wife, Georgie in
room 19 of the Hotel Columbia, where
in poverty they had been living for a
week. The murderer immediately after
ward turned the revolver upon himself.
and in the stomach Inflicted a mortal
wound. The tragedy was the end of
a senseless runaway marriage between
persons incompetent on either side to
care for themselves Individually and
far lews to carry the burdens and re
sponsibilities of matrimony. The wife
âa wÂ«ak. frail little thingâ crave birth
a little more than a fortnight ago to a
child. They hail no money except the
small sums given them by relatives.
In these pitiful straits Hanehette
showed a lack of manliness that is in
conceivable, even in a boy husband.
He railed weakly over the embarrass
ments that marital necessities placed
upon his ease-loving nature, and loafing
about their single room, quarreled pet
tishly with the girl he had sworn to |
honor and protect. He made no effort
to find employment, although he made ,
representations to the wife and to her j
nurse that he had secured, through an
: employment firm, a position as book
keeper in Santa Barbara. Hanehette
told them last night that he Intended to
leave for the coast town this morning.
The story of the prospective position
proves untrue. The wife was deeply
unhappy, in her feeble, girlish way, ,
over the failure of her marriage. Her
I mother and sisters, who until recently
lived in Los Angeles, went to .Denver ;
I some weeks ago and Georgie, lying ill
I in bed. was now alone with her nurse,
| her Improvident husband and her little .
; five-pound baby girl and was so weak '
that she could not handle the infant
and needed the constant care of the
attendant night and day.
The small sums of money that the
mother sent her from Denver were ab
stracted by Hanehette and spent upon '
: himself. The sick little wife suffered !
for - the necessaries of life. A week or !
two ago Hanehette received $20 from
his grandmother, who lives in San
Frnncripco. He spent the money for
fine raiment. The situation became un- j
â¢ bearable and the girl's mother, Mrs.
fi. M. Elliott, wrote from Denver that

The girl wife stiil cared in a measure

Hanehette was taken to the Good

tion lasting two hours was performed
' by a corps of physicians, who found
i that a bullet of thirty-eight caliber
j perforated the walls of the abdomen
ami thai considerable internal hemor
rhage had resulted. To-night Han
chette is reported resting easy, but life
hane-s on a slender thread.
Hanehette made a dying confession.
I He said he did not wish his mother-in
law to separate his wife from him and
, admitted that he had uttered a num
ber of forged checks. That he did so
is proved by a reporter who inyesti

The opinion gains ground that the
true motive was not the fact that his
wife would leave, but that h* feared to
'â â  face the crime of forgery that would
be to-day detected on checks passed
through the clearing-house this morn

OPPOSITION
OF GERMANY
IS REPORTED
But American Delegates Yet
Hope to Maintain Their
Arbitration Plan.
Social Dispatch to The Call.
CALL HEADQUARTERS. WEL
LINGTON HOTEL, WASHINGTON,
June 14. â Notwithstanding the state-
ment to' the contrary made by Mr.
Holls, secretary of the American dele
gation .to The Hague conference, it is
I authoritatively stated the American
' delegation has reported determined op
j position by Germany to the adoption of
I an arbitration resolution by the confer-
ence.
Considerable regret is felt in official
circles at Germany's attitude, but the
authorities do not ccc what is to be
| gained by concealing the fact, as Mr.
Holls is evidently trying to do. It is
believed that what he meant to say Is
that Germany has not shown any op
position to arbitration in deliberations
jof the committee having arbitration In
charge.
So far ns this Government is con
cerned it has instructed Its delegates
to The Hague to press upon the confer
ence the acceptance of the American
arbitration proposition. The authorities
! have closely examined the several arbi
| tration plans advanced, and while nat-
Ural pride is taken in the American pro
posal it is asserted that in comparing
the merits of each that presented by
Enibassadur White and his associates,
as set forth in The Call .his morning,
is the best. The understanding at the
State Department is that the British
plan will be the basis of discussion
when the arbitration committee sub
mits a report to the. conference. The
American delegates will urge upon the
conference the adoption of the Ameri
can plan in its entirety, because it con
templates a. permanent arbitration tri
bunal, while leaving the powers inter
ested in any dispute the option nf pre
senting their controversy to it for ju
dicial settlement. The United States
would be willing to have changes made
in details connected with the appoint
ment of the tribunal, number of its
members, etc.. but the officials hope
that the general scheme will be
adopted.
THE HAGUE, June 14.â The refusal
"f Great Britain to accept the stipula
tions of the Brussels conference if they
are made definite will not prevent the
other powers from pledging themselves
to action in the matter. There is no
doubt that the Brussels conference sub
committee will reach a practical result,
but it is supposed that some of the
powers, while reserving the right tn ap
ply the new stipulations when neces
sary may not bind themselves forth
with.

clergy to take a resolute stand
in favor of the republic and of
order and to work unanimously
for the religion and for the
prosperity of the country.
PARIS, June 14.â M. Poincare is
continuing his efforts to form a Cabi
net, but meets with numerous difficul
ties. He has been especially desirous
of having MM. Bourgeois. Krnntz and
Del ('f.s.^t' in th" Ministry. M. Bour
geois declines to abandon his mission
at The Hague. M. de! < 'mssp declines

Ministry of Marine, arid M. Krantz
rajses difficulties concerning the Drey
fus trial, pointing out that ho has dis
cussed the matter with M. t 'asimir-
Perier.
It is understi'uii that several other
prominent men have refused to enter
the Cabinet. These rebuffs are likely
to discourage M. Poincare, who is mod
est and diffident and is Inclined to steer
clear of political troubles.
President Loubet, when informed of
the sentence passed upon Baron de
Christiani for attempting t" assault
him in the Presidential stand on the
Auteuil race course, exclaimed:
"The four years will quickly pass."
This is held to indicate his intention to

Spirits Away From a

V \NÂ«or\KR. R. C, June 14.â Two Chinese, seated in a swaying buggy.
behind a horse thai was tearing like a runaway through the. streets of
Vancouver; one he.-ith.--n hanging to the reins, another grasping the seat
with one hand and with the other burdening the swirling air in the wake of
the flying rig with hundreds of streamers of paper, in blue strips and yel
low strips Chim s by the ynnl this was a sight witnessed by the
police and populaeÂ« to-day. A child was in the way of the wild horse. The
b were veiled a 4 l>y a hundred frightened men. "1.0.ik out for the
child!" but the horse tore on straight as an arrow.
Something white whirled under the animal's feet. Then one wheel
bumped just a little, ami the white thing lay still. It was the child, wounded
â  leath. The Chinese dashed Â«Â«n down the street, still scattering pray
ers. A largi â  rowd on bicycleÃ followed, and two policemen mounted
horses, and, after a long, determined chase, ran down the chinamen In the
â  â â¢r\. Their hors< was down In the shafts, and the two Chinese
were panting on the brink of an open crave of a departed companion. When
arrested they explained:
â¢â¢You put me jail: that all right. Me d" heap good act to dead fliend."
An interpreter explal I thai < how Wang, the dea<l Chinaman, had been
driven to the cemetery l>y mistake before his friends were ready to chase
away devils with paper prayers en route. When Ah Rung and Lew Chow
learned this the hearse had thirty minutes' start, so, hiring a horse and
buggy, they made an attempt t" reach the cemetery before the hearse. They
mÂ»t the h< arse half way to the burial ground, and believe that, as they
traveled exactly theÂ» sami route as the hearse before reaching i*. the pray
ers 'hey scattered along the line of i arch kept all the devils away from Chow
Wang. In attempting to save their friend's soul from the demons, how
ever, they have placed themselves where |hej may have to answer to a

wheat stalks. Th.- weakened stalks,
into by the insect, are broken by
the wind.
If it bo the genuine Hessian fly it is the j
first appearance of that pest in Califor- j
nia, so far as known. The description of I
the Hessian fly tits the specimens exhib- I
ited by Mr. McKinnon. They have be.'ii !
sent to an entomologist for examination. \
Whatever the insect Is, it is proving a i
plague to the wheat crops of this com- j
munity. J. Gardner examined the speci- !
mens tQ-day and asserts that they art:
the Hessian fly.
"1 am sure that the Hessian fly Is in :
my wheat," said Duncan McKinnon to
day. "I have 7"i acres in wheat, and I
find that every acre is affected My crop i
was tin.-. It would have made about fit
teen sacks to the acre, but now if I can j
get hay I will be satisfied. Up to three I
days ago I thought I would harvest a i
fine wheat crop. On- Tuesday I discbv- !
ered the insect pest, 1 had noticed for i
several days that my grain in spots was '
l ? lP â in)? ton rapidly. Going: into the!
field I found the grain in these particular
rspots had broken down. Naturally 1 ;
searched where the stalks had broken "and i
discovered the larvae. Since then I have â 
been searching diligently through all the ':
Other grain, but find that the pest has not ;
touched the barley, oats or other cereals. ;
When I had fluished with my crops I j
went over to adjoining ranches and dis- j
covered the pest there, too."
The female Hessian fly lays twenty or
thirty eggs in a crease of a leaf of the
growing wheat, and the larvae when j
hatched work their way between the leaf
and the stalk till they come to a joint,
a little below the surface, where they
suck the sap. They turn to pupae, en
closed in a covering; this is known as the I
â¢flaxseed" condition. The injury occa
sioned is not detected until the plant
grows higher. The usual result of the at
tack is that only shriveled heads of Â»rain
are formed.

AGREE ON TERMS
FOR THE MATCH
Jeffries and Sharkey
Eager to Meet.
INTERPOSING NO BARRIERS
THEIR MANAGERS TO CONFER
ON SATURDAY.
New Champion Determined to Give
All Ambitious Aspirants a
Chance to Win the
Honors.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK. June 14.â Everything now
points to a match between James Jeffrie's
and Thomas Bharkey for' the. heavy
weight championship of- the world. 'Wil
liam .A. Brady, Jeffries' manager, and
Thomas O'Rourke,' the adviser of the
sailor pugilist, will have a meeting on
Saturday, and. there is little doubt that
the managers will come to an understand
ing with regard to a match.
Some of the conditions made by Jef
fries in his original challenge to Sharkey
and to which O'Rourke objected on behalf
of the sailor will likely be modified.
Brady said to-day Jeffries would- waive
the side bet of $10,000, owing to the fact
that a Bide wager was considered illegal.
O'Rourke. at first objected to George Slier
of Chicago as referee, but he has decided
to waive his objections to Siler and will
accept the Chicago sporting writer as the
referee of the contest.
Brady intimated that theatrical ar
rangements would be a secondary con
sideration with the new champion. The
big fellow is anxious to fight all comers,
and they will be given consideration in
due time.
Sharkey will be given the first chance,
because Jeffries feels none too kindly dis
posed toward the sailor on account of the
latter's utterances in regard to their fight
In San Francisco. â¢â¢>
Still another aspirant to heavy-weight
honors is shaking his money at Jeffries.
He is Mike Morrissey. a Tipperary giant,
who Is soon to meet Peter Maher at the
I.enox Athletic Club. Morrissey's man
ager "P. J. Dwyer, has deposited $2riflo with
George Considine to bind a match with
JeJtrlts. Should the Irishman dispose of
Maher in good shape he might.be able to
force a meeting between the champion
and himself, but if he falls an easy prey
to Maher's science, as the general public
expects, he will receive scant notice from
Jeffries.

Men Needed in the Fields.
WOODLAND, June 14.â The scarcity of
man who will work in the. harvest field
has become a serious problem for the
farmers There have been many inquiries
to-day but there are but few idle men in
the county. There will be much difficul
ty in getting reliable help to harvest the
crops Where heretofore a great many
idle men found their way from San Fran
cisco and other big cities into the country
about harvest time, the farmers this year
have been compelled to rely upon labor
ers who make their homes in the country
the year around.
Employment for Whites.
WOODLAND, June 14.â The rumor that
the fruit crop of the Tolo orchard has

Eastern shipment have already been con

the crop and prepare it for shipment.
The report that but little white help
would be needed In the orchard this sea

help probably will be needed than ever
before, and where It Is possible to obtain
reliable help It will be given the prefer-

H. O. HAVEMEYER
EXPLAINS CAUSE
OF THE TRUSTS
Says It Is the Government,
Through Tariff Laws, That
Plunders the People.
WASHINGTON, 'June 14.â Henry 0. ,
Havemeyer,' president of the American;
Sugar Kenning Company, was; examined;
by the- Industrial Commission". to-day in
connection with its investigation of trusts.
His .testimony related" almost wholly to:
the sugar industry, and he opened with a
vigorous attack upon the customs tariff,
Which he declared was the "mother of all
trusts," becoming such' by providing '."in
ordinate protection to manufactured arti
cles." . . :
The full text of the statement read by
Mr. tiavemeyer is as follows:
' "The. mother of all trusts is the â  customs
tariff bill. The existing bill and the preced
ing ones have been the occasion tor the forma
tion of -ill the large trusts, with very few ex
ceptions, inasmuch as they provide for an in
ordinate protection to all' the Interests of the
country â sugar refining excepted. Economic ad
vantages incident to the consolidation of large
Interests In the same line of business are a
great Incentive to their formation, but these ,
bear a very Insignificant proportion to the ad
vantages granted In the way of protection un
der the customs tariff.
"There probably la not an industry that re
quires a protection of more than 10 per cent
ad valorem, and it Is to obtain what is provided
over such' percentage In the tariff that leads
to the formation of what are commonly spoken
of as 'trusts. ' , â¢ . â¢ â¢ â 
"With a protection to an industry not ex- ,
oeedlng 10 per cent, all menace to the com
munity of trusts would cease. This 10 per cent
would represent the difference- in cost of pro
duct lore and likewise act as a protection against
surplus products of foreign countries being
dumped in bur local markets, thereby interfering
with the regular and economic working of our
industries. Any advantage that might then
accrue to such combinations they would be
fully' entitled to and the public would not be
damaged thereby, as any expansion of price
would.be met by foreign competition and re
â¢ i have said that sugar was an exception.
The rat.- of protection on sugar is an eighth
of a cent per pound, which is about 3 1 ,s per
cent ad valorem, and is not the difference in
the cost of refining between this and foreign
countries. The least It should have is 8 per
cent, or in specific figures 1.4 cents per
pound. The sugar refining industry of this
country no matter what form its organisation
is entitled to adequate protection it any in
dustry is." There are at least 100,000 l Pie de
pendent upon it. What It pays or has paid to
Its stockholders in the past represents nothing
more than a fair return to the capital in
vested considering the extent of the business.
â¢â¢The United States tariff bill, in assessing
about $40 per ton duty on imported sugar,
pays into the pockets of a few* Louis laiians
on their annual crop of 250.000 tons. $.iO,0(K).OuO
to the Hawaiian Islanders, probably represented
hv 150 foreigners, on their annual crop of _-â >â¢â 
000 tons. Sio.fiOO.OOii. say 100.000 tons produced
elsewhere In the United States, $4,000,000. Here
you have 84.000 extracted from the people
of the United States for the sake of getting
the revenue which HO pel ton on foreign sugar
provides. This Is merely illustrative of the
whole tariff every line of it -and its effect upon
the people. In fact the tariff bill clutches the
people by the throat and then Governors and
the Attorney Generals of the Southern Mates
take action, not against the cause, but against
the machinery which the people employ to rifle
1 '"There appears to be In the public mind a
distinction between robbery by an individual
and thai by a corporation. What is com
mendable in an Individual appears to be dis

is on Â« whether by an individual, a firm, a
corporation or even the trust. These are mere

words, â  machinery tor the operation Of busi
ness It is the duty of the Government to
see that under the tariff laws they enact this
machinery cannot, In its action, result to the
detriment or impoverishment of the public.
"It would have been very easy and proper
for the Government to have put a correspond
ing internal revenue tax on sugar simul
taneously with the customs duty, and have
these 524000 000 which now go Into the pockets
of a few" individuals, go Into the trwinury for

Government In its tariff laws says It Is Proper
and suitable they should have. It is the Gov

ders the people, and the trusts, etc.. are merelj
the machinery for doing it.
"The statements made before the committee
in Congress and the speeches against the
sugar refining- company are absolutely devoid
of truth-utterly unworthy of credit. The In
tention of Congress, however, to enact some
n?ng"nto law contrary to what the sugar re
fining industry property required resulted, ir
respective of the great injury and injustice
done in the passage of the existing sugar
schedule. Whether the sugar refining company
haÂ« been a benefit or Injury to the community
can be best expressed in a table showing the
prices for a considerable period prior to the
formation of the trust and lor a correspond

What the sugar company has disbursed in divi
i dends has been not because of any extreme
protection under the tariff, but out of condi
tions perfectly legitimate and commendable.
The record Shows conclusively that no advan
tage has ever been taken by the. company of
any protection in excess of the 8 per cent
Claimed, that is, 1.4 cents per pound, under the
- "Tariff laws should not afford protection ex
ceeding 10 per cent to any industry, so that,
Irrespective of the form of doing business, In
dividual or corporation, the people, that is,
the consumer would be protected. As the tariff
laws are and have been it Is the consumer,
that is the great mass of the people, who has
terribly suffered to the great advantage of the
few of the business community.
"The sugar company undoubtedly tries Its
utmost to enlarge Its business, but does it in
a. way which it considers the only proper one,
that is. by making the price so low as to defy
competition.
"It is my opinion that corporations are under
no obligation whatever to any of the States for
their existence. Quite the reverse; the States
are under obligations to them. If the plants
of the industries consolidated were capable of
being put on wheels and moved from State to
State, you would find very active bidding for
them. It is not an unusual thing for certain*
localities to guarantee free taxation for twenty
years; free water and in some instances, give
the land to corporations to have them organize
under their statutes and locate In their States.
"Hostility to capital meets with its own con
demnation. That is illustrated by the situa
tion in New York. where a discrimination
against capital has prevented its employment
and driven it elsewhere, resulting in a greatly
Increased tax rate and a tendency to Increase
the number of unemployed. â¢
"All I have to say about trade organizations
and strikes is that, without violence, they are
natural. They have one objection, however,
their tendency to reduce all labor to a low level.
Business is not philanthropy. Capital and labor
will adjust their own relations If they are let
alone. Interference always operates against
one or the other. That means to the disad
vantage of both. There Is no such thing as
monopoly In these days except that which re
sults from patents and copyrights.
"The true â communism -of pelf is the cus
toms tariff bill. It says to the people: 'Here
is the law we have enacted for your robbery.
T>o not complain of It, but do your utmost to
attack and Injure the machinery engaged In
extracting from you what we legislate shall
be taken from you. Keep up the clatter while
the voters on the tariff bill take advantage of
the noise and enact laws that cause your Im
poverishment and thus contribute to the greed
and avarice of the few.'
"There Is. a prevailing hostility to wealth.
This is perfectly Illogical. Every one wants
money. It is the abuse of money, not Its pos
session, which is opposed to public . Interest.
This hostility ' finds its outlet in hostile legis
lation, "In "unequal and unjust : taxation. All
this is probably unconstitutional. It Is di
rectly against the Interest of the very classâ
I mean the poorer classâ whom it is supposed
to benefit. " â¢

"In the absence of all disturbing causes the

granted a permit to do business in

Smith bases his action on the
ground that the granting of such

and that it is. for the public good
that such corporations be excluded
from the State.
through the action of Individuals, themselves
possessed of unlimited capital. U Is- easy to
siv what, In the latter case, would happen to
the community.
"One form in which hostile action manifests
Itself is by legislation which is intended to
keep corporations and their products out of
particular States. This legislation in some
States takes the form of bills which permit
citizens to buy goods and with impunity to
refuse to pay for them. This is a premium on
dishonesty. In other States the attempt is to
exclude articles which are of. prime necessity.
If the producer? of such articles were to follow
the lead and to combine to keep their com
modities out of the State it is easy to see
what would result, i. c., either the people
would be compelled to go without or they
Would be forced to pay an inordinate price.

"In these days there are two forms and only
two forms of monopoly. One, that which re
sults from a patent and copyrights. It if* unl
vi-rsnlly recognized that this la In the Interest,
not against the Interest of the public. The
other, that which comes from . unfair tariff
discrimination.
"Tariff for revenue need not be considered.
The expenses of the Government must of course
be provided for. Tariff for the purpose of
equalizing against foreign bounties or foreign
discrimination does not need to be Justified.
Beyond that there is no excuse for giving to
one industry a protection of ]00 per cent, as
against 4 per cent for another, or any more
than 10 per cent. The result is that the Gov
ernment fleeces the community at large in the
Interest of some favored Industry.
"It must be kept in mind that this is a rich
country, not a poor country. It must be kept
In mind that the object of every one is to make
the country stronger, wealthier, more impor
tant, more influential.
"The hostile action to which I referred, leg
isiaii.'ii against corporations, if followed to its
legitimate results, would make the country less
powerful, Its people less prosperous, and would
lestroy the influence which comes from the
richness of the land and its people.
"Citizens are divided Into two classesâlndus
trious and those who wish to live on thÂ» in
dustry of others, it is they who ar? without
capital, who are hostile to it. This is only
another mode of statin* the obvious proposi
tion tiuit it is thoÂ«-- who are without means
who wish to tm\.- it without work."
-Mr Havemeyer' a statement aroused great
interest, an.l the next three hours were de
â¢â¢â !â¢ ! to answering questions asked him In
rapid succession by the members of the com-
He made an incidental statement
which the commit tea construed Into an ad
mlssion that the business was not profitable
now The witness confessed that his company
â¢ ry little regard for the welfare of rivals
in business, saying that prestige, ability ex
â  and wealth would win in the 'long
run In the struggle, and tftat trusts were an
example of the survival of tV- fittest in busi
ness.
'That is trade," he said, "and the sooner
you realize it and quit trying to control it by
Federal legislation the better for all. A man
cannot expect 'to have himself continually wet?
nursed by the Government. If men do not want
to buy our stocks, they need not. They don't !
need Government protection. If they wade In
and get stuck let them get out, and if they wish
wade in again. The fate of rival concerns is
their affair, not ours."
He declared that the tariff enabled the steel
rail trust to mulct the public to the extent
of $Â» per ton, and said incidentally that Mr.
Carnegie had not yet stated what he was going
to do With his money.
On the question of labor Mr. Havemeyer said
the laboring element were forced to form or
ganizations, but that in doing so they sacrificed
much independence and the unions had the
effect of bringing other men down to a low
level. He contended that he was a friend of
labor and said that good men in the employ of

could get elsewhere.
Mr. Havemeyer said that many things were
done in business which looked cold-blooded and
harsh, but that business conditions often re
quired conduct justifying such characteriza
tion. The farmers, he thought, ought to es
tablish a trust for their protection. He de
clared that his company had not, gone into
a combination with Â«ny of the Independent re
fineries. Reports that such a consoliAtion had
been effected were untrue.
Replying to a question as to how he could
conduct business at a loss and still declare
dividends Mr. Havemeyer declared, laughingly

would be a good plan to expose the business

turn home, even to checking his bap
gage. He was last seen when starting
for the depot. After that hour no trace
of the missing man. was ever found
He seemed to have dropped from the
face of the earth. The police depart
ment of Chicago made an extensive in
vestigation of the case, but was utterly
baffled. Various theories were ad
vanced about the disappearance, some
contending that he was not murdered,
but for some known reason purposely
disappeared, deserting his family. The
consensus of opinion is that Hanchette
had been made away with by thugs
and his body disposed of by dumping
it into the lake. There were periodical
revivals of the story, brought about by
reports that Hanchette had been seen
in various places. Hanchette had an
honorable career both in Los Angeles
and San Francisco. Before coming to
this city he had been well known as a
newspaper man in San Francisco, and
later, coming to Lob Angeles, became
city editor of the Herald, which posi
tion he filled until elected secretary of
the Chamber of Commerce.
"When Hanchette was secretary of
the Chamber of Commerce he was as
fine a man as there was in town," said
Secretary Wiggins to-night. "The most
generally believed theory in regard to
Hanchette's disappearance is that he
was held up in Chicago and killed.
There was not a suggestion of dishon
esty about the case. His books w*>re
all checked up after he had disappeared
and everything was found to be
straight." â

Was a Bane.
WRITES TO NEW YORK HERALD
DECLARES CERTAIN HEADLINES
DID HIM AN INJUSTICE.
Draws a Fine Distinction Between
What He Said and What the
Editor Thought He
Meant.
Special Olspatch to The Call.
NEW YORK. Jtine 14.â C P. Hunting
ton sends the following to the editor of
the Herald:
Pome one has sent a cUpplng from the Herald
uf May 1"> an the subject of my remarks de
liverei] in San FranciÃCO at a dinner given by
myself to the heads of departments of the
Southern Pacific Company. Pica headlines
ijuote me as Faying that 'â¢Education is Amer
ica's Bane." Below this headline, in the body
Df the article, you quote correctly the words
that I said, and they do not at all bear out
thin headline, which certainly does me an in
justice, as I neither said. Intimated nor thought
education was America's bane; and It seems to
me the Herald should not have printed the
headline, or els>e it should not have printed the
words I did actually say, as the latter In no
sense confirm the former.
I should not have noticed it had It not ap
peared in a great daily like the Herald, which,
I feel quite sure, does not desire to put into
any one's mouth a statement whli-h he not only
did not make, but which discredits his com
mon sense. Yours very truly,
C. P. HUNTINGTON.
Here is what Huntfngton said. in the
speech which he admits was correctly
rjuoted in the New York Heraldâ the Her
ald petting its report from The Call. If the
words he uses do not indicate his belief
that "education is" America's bane," what
do they mean?
I regret one tendency in our country, ad
mit*able as are her institutions. It is almost
heresy to say It, but I do not mind taking the
responsibility, for that Is one of the things I
am used to. I refer to the Increase of the
highnr education for the masses. The Anglo-
Saxun has easily outstripped all his compptl
tors in those things which make for the com
mercial growth and success of nations, be
cause he has been, above all other things, prac
tical. While the preparation for professional
life requires advanced knowledge, it seems to
me that the vast majority of our young people
spend too many of their vigorous years of youth
Inside the schoolroom and not enough in the
practical work of life. The yearn from fifteen
to twenty-one .Â»rp immensely valuable, for they
are the years of keen observation, individuality
and confidence. In many cases â quite trxi many
âthey are spent in cramming the mind with
kii"Wlf>ilp" that la not likely to help a young
man in the work he is best fitted to do. H">w
many young men with college erlucatinriÃ are
Btandlng about waiting fur something that will
never com.- because the work that lies nearest
ut hand in nnt to their liking? Somehow or
other our schools, which teach young people
how to talk, do not teach them how to live.
People need little, but want much. Strict I
have come to California one-third of my daily
mall Is'made op r.f appeals for help, and they
calls are about equally divided between re
qUests for contributions to help pay off d^hts
and rnortffaee? which should nnt hrtvf been
contracted; applications of yÂ«">ung men out of
w.'rk. which always have my sympathy; and
crips fur succor from the sick and suffering
poor, who nmnt tip cared for. whatever may
be the cause nf rheir sickness or their povertyâ
an. l Hi* poor we have always with us. The
â one of farmers are forsaking the fields be
cauM the cities arc more attractive to them.
It seems to me that slowly but surely there
Is growing uj, a ftronprer and stronger 'wall of
caste, with good honpst labor on one sMe and
frivolous gentility on thp other. We seen to he
fast outgrowing those things which when our
fathers lived, were called sterling qualities hut
now are called follies, or work that a gentle
mi: n should not do, as though all honest work
wiÂ»>= nut honorable work. The world has grown
small. When I was a boy it was a very- big
thing.
PLACE FOR MACKENZIE.
SAN JOSE. June 14.â John D. Macken
zie has been recommended for Census
Marshal for this district by Congressman
Loud and he undoubtedly will receive
the place. The information was re
ceived in a letter from Senator Perkins,
who states that at a caucus of the Sena
tors and Congressmen from California,
held in San Francisco about ten days
ago. it was decided to leave the selection
of the Census Marshal to the various
Congressmen, and that Congressman
Loud had recommended Mackenzie.
A week ago the Republican Good Gov
ernment League indorsed R. S. Ammeh
for the place, and wrote to Mr. Loud,
asking him to appoint Ammen. To-day a
letter was received from Loud saying' he
had already made the selection and no
further action could be taken.

Mass Meeting of Orchardists Aroused
to Enthusiasm by the Words of
Executive Committee
Members.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
FRESNO, June 14.â mass meeting of
deciduous fruit growers was held here to
day to arouse enthusiasm in support of
the association recently organized at Sftc
ramento. R. I). Stephens, president of the
executive committee, was present and
with him were the other members of the
committee. Alexander Gordon of this city
was elected chairman after me meeting
had been called to order. Mr. Gordon
called upon R. D. Stephens, who ex
plained the proposed plan of escape from
the clutches of the refrigerator car com-, /
parties. X W
W. E. Levdall of Sacramento read the
proposed articles of incorporation, which
were to the effect that the corporation
was to be for a term of tiff, ears; the
capital stock to be $600,000, and the direc
tors to be nine- in number. The principal
place of business will be Sacramento The,
capital stock being limited, subscribers
will be liable for ojiiy the amount of stock
for which they subscribe.
Edward I. Galvin, treasurer of the as
sociation, cave an interesting talk on th^
necessity of organization. He thought th i
attempt of the organization was the wis
est plan that had ever been placed before
the fruit growers. The situation was crit
ical. Many who would like to join with
other growers and form this organization
could not do so because they were crip
pled â their crops being mortgaged to
f*iit-shipping concerns. .The fruit grow
ers themselves were the capitalists, and
not the shipping concerns nor the Eastern
capitalists. All that was needed was or
ganization. .
The horticultural business of the State
was greater, he said, than that of any
other State, and counted far into the mil
lions and was steadily growing. Consid
ering this, it was foolish to think the
fruit growers could not be independent if
they wished. Mr. Galvin's was a forcible
argument and made a deep impression. .
- Mr. Stephens followed Mr. Galvin. He '
spoke in favor of organization, declaring
that if the association were successful the
rates on green fruit shipments to the
East would be reduced from 50 to 70 per
cent, and that this amount would go di
rectly into the hands of the growers.
After the meeting an opportunity was
given the growers to sign contracts ami
many of them did so. The actual signers
numbered over a dozen and assurances . .
were received from many more. A com- \ '
mittee consisting of F. R. Lindsay. Johm
S. Dore, Frank Rowell, R. R. Madsen
and L. H. Twede was appointed to ar
range for another mass meeting a week
from next Saturday, to work up more
enthusiasm on the subject of organiza
tion. The growers here are heartily in
favor of the plan adopted at Sacramento
and may be depended upon to support the
association. ~r'T ."

that promised to do much tor this Bection
of the San Joaquin Valley. Some nn< i

minds fully made up" to accepi one â  I
sites offered. The smelter men. however,
â . eir acceptance would have to await
i by th- Eastern directors and
;l anal decision has been expected by
every mail.
Throughout the deal the Bmelter repre
sentatives have been vÂ«ry cautious, and it
M,<m became evident there was Influence
to tak.- the enterprise from
Madera and locate it elsewhere. At first
an effort was mad.' to place the plant
west of the Southern Pacific trark. where

railroad company, but the Bite which

for until yesterday, on that day Mr.
Fohnson and. another representative ol the
company arrived in Madera, and. taki-i?,'
â¢i surveyor, drove to Herndon, about
twelve miles south Of Madera on the line
of the Bouthern Pacific It in claimed that
the railroad company owns all the avail
able land at that point, and that it would
not only have the benefit of the sale of
land but would shut off the competition
of another road:
s i". Booth, district freight agent nf the
railroad company, claims his company

little faith in the protestations of the
company. While there is no direct evi
dence that th< "octopus" has had its
â¢iLjents at work, it is certain that no â 
save Hunting/ton's railroad wuulrl 'be
benefited by the erection of a smelter at
Herndon Instead â â ! at Madera.
Thi Madera sit.- is on the north bank
of the Fresno River, which is a river only

company would have to dump its slag and
refuse into the s.-ni Joaquin River, which
i^ a navigable stream and abounds in

to have all their business routed over thÂ«
Valley road by way Of retaliation. The
reeling against the railroad company H
very Strong here, and every effort will be
us.il to prevent the erection of tiii'
smelter at the point favored by the
Southern Pacific
The people of Madera have not only of
fered everything asked for 'y the smelt
iiitr company, but have in addition to a
Bite offered a free right of way from both
railroads to it h location and guaranteed a
Bupply of water as large as it could pos

UPPER YUKON RIVER
OPEN FOR NAVIGATION
PORT TOWNSEND, June 14.â The Tp
per Yukon River is now open for naviga
tion. The steamer Flora, whirh left Daw
son on May 25, arrived at White Horse !
on June 3. One of her passengers. Wll-
Ham P. Allen of Seattle, who arrived here
to-night on the steamer Al-Ki, reports
that the Yukon River was open at Daw
son on May 17â nine days later than last '
year. The trip was made without diffi
culty until Lake Marsh was reached.
There the ice had to be cut in order to
get through. He reports forty-two loaded
BCOWS ai Tagish. lietween Tagish and
Bennett fifty more scows were passed, all
laden and bound for Dawson.
Since the big (ire Dawson has been the
scene of business activity. Sawmills have
been running day sind n'ght, but have
been unable to supply the demand fur
lumber. Ev^ry man who can drive a nail
has secured employment.
The season was somewhat backward
this year, and as a result thf> clean-up
did not commence until a short time be-'
fnre Allen started out. He says what
little was known of the results of thr>
clean-up was most satisfactory and claim
owners were jubilant. Many predict that
the output of gold this year will far ex
ceed the expectations of the most san
guine.
Allen says the reported exodus from
Dawson for Cape Nome is mythical, an
news of the strike at that place had not
reached Dawson when he left.

OUTLAW MOORE
SLEEPS IN COURT
Utterly Indifferent as to
His Fate.
Special I>iÂ«;iatph to Thp <"all.
NEVADA CITY, June 14.â Edward
Moore went sound asleep this morning
during the progress of his trial for the
murder of Officer Kilroy. His face was
as placid as that of an infant. He slept
about three minutes, then awoke with
such a start that he almost tumbled off
his chair. If he has realization of the
seriousness of his position he does not
manifest it. He Is either inhumanly In
different to his fate or is a consummate
actor.
The impaneling of a jury was not rom
pleted till late t His afternoon. A Bcore of
freeholders who were examined as to their
qualifications swore that they were sn
firm in their conviction as to Moore's
guilt, because of what they had read of
his crime In the papers, thai not enough
testimony on the lines of insanity fir self
defense could be piled up by his lawyer to
cause them to ohange their minds. One
of these when asked if he could not give
Moore a fair trial, said nothing could be
more to his taste than to sit onÂ«the case In
Judge Lynch's court. Others declared that
if they were ki pt nil ihe jury and the plea
<>f insanity were interposed they would
treat it as a sham and a subterfuge.
In his opening statement the District
Attorney said he would prove that Moore
had on various occasions warned Kilroy
not to attempt his arrest if he did not
want to die. and that he had told others
he would kill the policeman the first time
he caught him alone.
Dr. A. 11. Tickeil described the three
powder-burned wounds in the dead man,
any one of which would have been fatal.
County Surveyor Waggoner showed a dia
gram of the scene of the killing, and B.
A. Moore, a photogrpher, identified the
pictures he had taken of the wounds the
morning they were inflicted.
While the wounds were being described
to the jury the dead man's brother, Jo
seph, a big stalwart miner, bowed his
head and wept.

which was briefly covered by cable fiom

scrubby ami utmost uninhabited shore
which blocks the entrance Into St. Yin- \

pallors out of the thirty-four souls aboard j
succeeded in saving their lives; the rest
wore- lost in the boiling surf.
These four survivors wandered for days j

splendid man. From the time the ship I
struck he never moved off the deck, but
stood faithfully at his post. Within fif- j

ENCYCLICAL LETTER
ARRIVES TOO LATE
NEW YORK. June 14.â The encyclical
letter of Pope Leo XIII dedicating the en- !
tire world to the sacred heart of Jesus |
and designating June 9. 10 and 11 to be |
set apart throughout the Christian world ;
for special devotion, has just reached this |
country.
Owing to some unaccountable delay on j
the part ot the authorities at Rome it j
failed to reached Monfeignor Martinelli in
time for the Archbishops and Bishops of j
the United States to act in accordance j
with its stipulations. It was designed to |
be read in parishes throughout the cnun- |
Try and promulgated in sufficient time to;
make the consecration of widespread in- i
tereot and a public demonstration not un- |
like that at Vienna last Sunday, when the
Emperor solemnly dedicated himself,
family and court to the sacred heart.
The encyclical appeared first in the
Observatore Romano, the official organ
of the Vatican. May 26. and made Its way
t<i P;iris. Cologne, Vienna and London in |
time for due observance. Archbishop Cor- I
rigan has been waiting its receipt, and
upon its non-arrival he Issued a pastoral
letter to the clergy of this diocese, and on !
the feast of the sacred heart. June 9, in
lieu of the act of consecration specially
recommended by the Pope in his encycli
cal the Archbishop recited the act that
has been in use the last quarter of "a
century.
The encyclical is vet news to a large
part of the Bishops of the United Stales.
When His Holiness learns of the delay he
will in all probability give an extension of
time for cansecration. Since the feast of
the blessed Margaret Mary, with whom
the devotion originated, falls on October
17, it is posible the Holy Father will set
that day paart for the dedication of this
country.
DISPLACEMENT OF THE
HEART CAUSES DEATH
SALINAS, June 14,â Dr. G. TV. Caldwell.
a dentist and large property owner of
this valley, died yesterday. Dr. Caldwell's
Illness was a long one and most peculiar,
his case puzzling the medical fraternity
of the State. Originally he had a pul
monary complaint, but it seemed to de
velop Into lympanona, a virtual displace
ment of the heart from its proper pasl
'â¢â  tion to the right side of the body. No cure
â  was found, and several times the patient
'â  remained in a comatose condition for a
long time. Dr. Caldwell was a prominent
Native Son, unmarried and quite wealthy.
RATTLESNAKE'S BITE

UKIAH, June 14.â Juan Sppulvedn. a
noted vaquero of Round Valley, was bit

after suffering intensely for four hours,
died in great agony. Sepulveda had been
in the habit nf catching- rattlers by the
nccU and clinking them to death. He ne
cured an enormous one on Monday after
noon, but his grip was too far back. The
snake turned its head and sunk Its fangs
into the vaquero's index finger. Sepul
veda was a pioneer of Northern Mendo

Mendoiino County was formed.

DR. KILMER'S REMEDIES.
DR. KILMER'S SWAMP-ROOT
Is Not Recommended for Everything.
But If You Have Kid.icy or Bladder
Trouble It Will Be Found Just â¢
the Remedy You Need.
Kidney trouble preys upon the mind,
â  discourages and" lessens ambition;
beauty, vigor and cheerfulness soon
disappear when the kidneys are out of
order or diseased.
Kidney trouble has become so preva-
j lent that it is not uncommon for a
child to be born afflicted with weak kid-
neys. If the child urinates too often,
I if the urine scalds the flesh, or if. when
; the child reaches an age when it should
be able to control the passage, and it
is yet afflicted with bed-wetting, de-
pend upon it, the cause of the difficulty
Is kidney trouble, and the first step
should be toward the treatment of these
important organs. This unpleasant
trouble is due to a diseased condition
of the kidneys and bladder and not to
a habit as most people suppose.
So we find that women as well as
men are made miserable with kidney
| and bladder trouble and both need the
I same remedy. The mild and the im-
. mediate effect of Swamp-Root Is soon
j realized. It is sold by druggists, In
: fifty-cent and one dollar sizes. You
may have a sample bottle by mail free,
also pamphlet telling all about it, in-

i timonial letters received from sufferers

I wore to bo taken as being of faith.
This came out In reply to several ques- !
" tions from Mr. F'illHbury. Judge Ilayne !
had remarked that the* old board acted i
I in good faith all through the suit and ,
that its members were all good, clean :
men. Pillsbury asked if the same did not
obtain as to the prc-sent board. Judge
Hayne could not but say it did, and tlien .
Plllsbury asked if then their motion to ;
. dismiss th<- suit without costs was not [
to be taktn as being made in good faith.
It was somewhat of a facer for Hayne, j
â  but he explained that when the Commis
sioners rescinded the resolution fixing the j
rates th< y did not know they hud not re- ;
scinried the schedule as well, and there- j
fore they were not bound by any action !
they bad taken at that time.
It took half, an hour of the morning ;
1 session for I'illsbury to finish his argu- \
ment begun last Monday. Taking up i
the subject at the rescinding of the reso- I
Unions establishing the rat'-s he argued ,
I that by doing so the Commissioners had
rendered useless the suit commenced and '
, continued for river two years: the com- i
; pany had been put to great expense, he
said, in conducting the suit, and the re-
BCinding of the resolution was an ad mis- I
: slon on the part of the Commissioners!
that the resolutions could not stand the!
test of the suit, which was the conten
tion of the company, and that, therefore,
it amounted to a judgment in favor of i
1 the company.
I In expatiating upon the right of the
; Railrf ad < ''immissioners to fix the rates
; and to adopt the 8 per cent and the 2".
per cent schedules, Mr. Hayne said that
; the Question was not whether the rates
were reasonabli or not. He contended
that the r; ( t<s must be grossly unreason
: able, even flagrantly so, and must show
! beyond any question that the rates were '
! so grossly unreasonable as to amount to
I a confiscation of the property, before the ,
i court would have a right to use Its dis- '
( retlon in setting them aside. That had
been held by the United States Supreme'
, Court in the water cases.
The case was then submitted to the I
: court.

Fell Thirty Feet.
Michael l,avin, a hod-carrier, GS years
Of age. fell from the roof of a building at
Beale and Harrison streets a few minutes
before 8 o'clock last 'light and was picked
up unconscious. He was taken to the
Harbor Receiving Hospital, where it was
found that he had sustained a fracture of
the skull and possible Internal injuries.
His recovery is doubtful. Nobody seems
to know just how the accident occurred.
Lavtn went to work on the building at
about 2 o'clock yesterday afternoon and
workc-d steadily ap to the time the acci
dent occurred. He was not seen to fall,
but it Is supposed that he missed his
footing while stepping from the topmost
rung of the ladder to the roof. His place
of residence is 37 1 * Madison avenue, and
he bus a wife and married daughter.

Santa Cruz will bump up against the
Senators at Sacramento and is liable to
have a distressing time of it now that
the tailenders have got to moving. San
Jose will go to "Watsonville, and that se
ries will be for blood from the sound-off.
Manager Harris frankly admits that he
would rather go against any team in the
league than the Senators. The way
those tailenders put it on Hank's men
in all sorts of extra-inning skyrocket
games makes the local magnate exceed
ingly tired. The other teams seem to
have no great difficulty in vanquishing
the Statesmen, but with Harris it is dif
ferent. Hank says that if he loses the
championship it will be due to Sacra
mento.
The sirocco that swept over Recreation \
Park during last Sunday's game, strang- i
ling and blinding the spectators with
thick clouds of sand, has stirred the man- i
agement to take steps to alleviate the dts- !
comforts of its patrons. The diamond has !
been harrowed and scraped off and 100 !
loads of rich loam Is being spread, which I
will pack down smooth and solid, so that I
there will he no further annoyance from i
dust and dirt. Incidentally it will improve I
the work of the inflelders, as they can I
handle the ball much better on a loam !
diamond than on the sand. This Improve- i
ment will be completed in ample time fur â 
Saturday's game. In case the manage- I
ment docs not secure more corrrmodiLns
grounds for next season the entire Held ,
at Recreation Park will be covered with
loam in the fall and the outfield up to the j

Since Dr. McGraw took hold of the ban
Jose team that town has become one or
the best ball towns in the State in point
of attendance and Interest In the .game.
The team is steadily improving in na
work, the members are all popular wit n
the public, and the Garden Citys bid lair
to show a handsome balance on the
credit side of the ledger at the close or
the season. Last Sunday the team put up
a wonderfully fast game against the Lob
sters, the score standing 1 to 1 for nine
Innings. In the tenth, however, the lead
ers won out with another tally.
Sullivan will be back in the game this
week. His ankle, which he sprained last
Sunday morning, is greatly Unproved.
The locals will need his batting in the
Oakland series.
By mutual consent Sacrampnto and
Santa Cruz have exchanged dates. The
Senators were scheduled to play at the
sea beach this week and (he Lobsters
were due in Sacramento on July 22 and '.',.
Now, however, Santa Cruz will go to Sac
ramento this week and the Senators will
make their trip in July.
Although rumors still float up from
Wataonvllle of a change in the manage
ment, Mr. Struve is said to have recon
sidered his determination to sell out and
will remain in charge of the team.
President Moran, Vice President Bert
and Secretary Bonnet, who constitute

Sentiments.
Metropolitan Temple was crowded last
night in response to a rail fnr a mass
mer-ting held under the auspices of the
Labor Council, Building Tr.i.icp Council
and Affiliated Unions. The object of thn
meeting wns to voice a strong protest
against the establishment of military rule
;it Wardner, [daho, the scene of the re
cent miners' troubles.
Chairman P. U. McCarthy stated that
it was not a partisan or political protest
nut one in the name of humanity against
the methods employed by the Idaho au
thorities and General Mefriam.
Judge Highton, James Q. Maguire and
A. R. Andre addressed the audience in a
similar vein, and the following resolu
tions were adopted by unanimous vote:
Whereas. The horrors of the Ward
ner "bull pen" and the unconstitu
tional arts of Governor Steunenberg
and Brigadier General Merriam in
their treatment of the parties sus
pected of complicity in the destruction
of the Bunker Hill and Sullivan Hill
mines at Wardner, Idaho, continue in
spitp of protests from fill parts of the
country; and
Whereas. It is evident from the most
reliable sources thnt Governor Steun
enberg is a pliant tool of the mine
owners, combined to establish indus
trial feudalism in Idaho; therefore
be it
Resolved. By the citizens' mass- I
meeting called by the Labor Council
and Building Trades Council of San
Francisco that we protest against the
suspension of the writ of habeas cor
pus in time of peace; that we denounce
the suppression of free speech and
free press and the denial of "the right
of combination"; that we inndemn the
wanton brutalities of the "bull pen"
and that we call upon all trades
unionists and citizens in general to
make similar protest; and further
Resolved That we call upon Presi
dent McKinley. as commander-in-chief
of the army, to order the cessation of
the usurpation of power by the mili
tary; and further
Resolved, That we request the Cali
fornia Representatives to ;isk. on the
assembling of Congress, for a Congres
sional Investigation of the Wardner
brutalities; and further
Resolved. That the secretary of this
meeting wire these resolutions to
President McKinley.

now in Idaho, was read, in which he re
iterated the statements which were re
cently published in The Call regarding the
situation at Wardner.
"The lives and liberties of the miners
and laborers," he concludes, "are now in
the hands of one manâ the executive of
Idaho, who has allied himself with their
adversaries and who has called in United
States troops to carry out the schemes
of the mine owners to increase their own
enormous profits by pauperizing, oppress
ing and starving the miners into abject
and absolute submission."
Mayor Phelan and Charles 1,. Fatten
sent letters of regret at being unable to
be present, while sympathizing with the
purpose for which the mass-meeting was
called.

C. J. TRUMAN TESTIFIES.
Said Captain Hall Recognized Rulof
son as His Son.
T. J. Truman was called as a witness
yesterday in the action instituted by A.
I . Rulofpon, in which he seeks to re
cover the entire estate of the late Cap-
tain Wlnslow O. Hall, whom the plaintiff
claims was his adopted fater. Mr. Tru
man said that on many occasions when
he met Captain Hall he would speak to
him about Rulofson, when the witness
said Captain Hall always referred to as
his adopted son. Captain Hall said that
he had legally adopted Rulofson. Mr. Tru
man said, and also said that he always
intended to care for him and treat him
as he would his own son. Mr. Truman
was positive in his statements and was
an important witness for the plaintiff.

DEMOCRATS SHOW NO REGARD FOR
REPRESENTATION OF MINORITY.
Delegates to the Convention to
Be Selected by Districts.
THE disgruntled "uitlandors" of the I
local Democracy marie their con
templated raid last night into the i
territory of the Committee of One
Hundred. They met their Kruegprs
dorp and were routed by the Boers under
the leadership of "Onm" Jasper McDon
ald. Major Barna McKinnie led the
charge, encouraging Ills followers by wav
ing a resolution calling for the enlarge
mi'iit of the Democratic Volksraad that
the privilege of a vote therein should lie
extended to at least fifty of the faithful
now in the hinterlands.
The major was ably supported by Ben
Wright and one or two others, but ijis
forces were impaled on chevaux do frise,
planted in the name of points of order by
"Oom" Loo Kaufman, and wqre allowed
to wriggle there, while "Oom" Jasper held
the disturbing resolution up in the air.
This action settles once for all, no mat
ter how much the "uitlanders" hope
otherwise, the Question of the enlarge
ment of the committee. The members do
not wish to confer any of their powers on
outsiders, and their vole last night shows
that they are sufficiently in the majority
to shut off any attempt to Increase their j
number.
The committee also decided on district,
as against precinct, election of delegates
to the coming convention. This was not
done, however, without a vigorous pro- |
tesj from several members, who claimed '
that the minority had sonif rights. The
committee also adopted the report of the;
committee of seven on apportionment.
This was not done without considerable
difference of opinion and discussion,
some acrimony and many appeals to the
fairness of the committee.
Probably the most important business
of the meeting was transacted just before
adjournment, when a resolution was in
troduced that the chairman of the com
mittee be empowered to appoint from its
membership an executive committee of
eighteen, one from each Assembly Dis
trict, with the chairman and secretary
added. to engage headquarters and use
all means necessary to enlist Democratic
voters in the campaign. Although the evi
dent purpose of the resolution was to put
the power of the entire Committee of
One Hundred in the hands of the twenty,
it was adopted with a rush. The chair
was given until the next meeting to make
up his mind.
It was 8:50 o'clock when Chairman Jas
per McDonald ascended the platform and
rapped the. committee to order. After
rollcall and the approval of the minutes
of the last meeting Secretary Walsh read
a communication from the Democratic
State Central Committee, heretofore pub
lished, urging the Committee of One
Hundred to so act in the apportionment
of delegates to the county convention as
to promote harmony in the party in this
county.
Pat Boland declared that the communi
cation was an unwarranted interference
with the affairs of the local committee,
and moved that the communication be re
turned to the State Central Committee.
\V J. McGee offered as an amendment
to the motion that the communication be
received and placed on rile. The amend
ment carried.
E P. E. Troy, chairman of the com
mittee appointed to learn whether any
Democratic office-holders were aiding or
abetting the movement to test the validity
of the charter, reported that assurances
had been received from all Democrats
elected atÂ»the last election declaring that
they were not parties to any such suit,
and that they believed in sustaining the
charter. He read letters from Mayor Phe
lan Supervisors Byington. Deasy and
Lackmann, School Director Eells and
Brandensteln, Judges Conlan and Slogan,
Coroner Hill. Assessor Dodge and City
and County Attorney Lane to this effect.
The report, in which the. following reso
lutions were embodied, was then adopted:
Whereas. Certain officials of this city and
county are now contesting the validity of the
new charter: therefore, be it
Resolved, That the Democratic city and
county committee congratulate the Democratic
party upon the fact that not one of its nom
inees is to be found among these pledge break
ing enemies of our municipality; and be it fur-
Resolved That we congratulate the peopl? of
this city upon having elected some officials
who are faithful to the trust put in them and
abide by the platform of their party.
{â¢'mil Pohli, in the absence of Chairman
Bvington "f the committee on appor
tionment, then read the following report:
To ihe Democratic <~Hy and County Com
mltteet-Gentlemen: Tour committee appoint
ed to prepare a plan Of apportionment of the
delegates to the next municipal convention of
the democratic party. In compliance with the
primary law passed by the last Legislature, re
spectfully report? as follows:
1 That after earnest discussion and mature
deliberation of the various plans of apportion
ment suggested, such as at larjfe, or by ilis
tncts or by precincts, your committee unani
mously recommends:
2. That the apportionment be made upon the
LINCOLN MONUMENT.
The League Begins Active Steps for
Its Erection.
The. general committee of the .Lincoln
Monument League met last night in the
rooms of the Union League Club, Palace
Hotel, with President W. W. Stone in
the chair and Frank Elliott Myers secre
tary.
During the past year the Span
ish war has absorbed every interest and
comparatively little progress ; has been
made, but now the league will make re
newed efforts to accomplish the erection
of a monument to the memory of Lincoln
in Golden Gate Park.
The committee has had assurances from
wealthy citizens that just as soon as. suf
ficient progress had been made toward
the accumulation of a generous . fund
they would come forward with liberal
contributions.
It was decided that the aid of the Co
lonial Dames, Daughters of the American
Revolution, Children of the Revolution,

Ladies of the Grand , Array of the Re- .

basis of the average Democratic vote cast at I
the last election in each of the eighteen as
sembly districts in this city ami county, and
that the officers of your committee hp Instruct- '.
ed to certify In the petition to be filed under I
the Jaw with the election commission that th" |
Democratic delegates to the local convenion |
are apportioned upon the basis of the average
Democratic vote cast at the last election in
SUCh combination of primary election precincts, !
established by said commission, as are In
cluded in and coterminous with the several
assembly districts.
3. Your committee, believing that the pres
ent primary law makes it possible that the ;
voters of this city, and not the bosses, may de
termine who shall represent them for the pur
pose of formulating the policy of the party |
and nominating the candidates for the offices
in their gift, deems it wise that the governing
body of the Democratic party in devising a
plan of nominating the delegates, should give
the voters the amplest opportunity for "home
rule" in that regard; hence, your committee I
earnestly recommends that the delegates in the !
several districts be nominated in such manner i
that every general election precinct shall be :
represented by at least one bona fide resident
elector. ,
4. Your committee further recommends that '
: there shall be one delegate for each sixty votes
and one additional delegate for a remainder of
thirty votes or over, and that your officers be
' instructed to certify such basis of representa
tion in said petition.
And in that behalf your committee herewith
States: That from the figures furnished by the
Registrar of Voters of this city and county, it

In conclusion, your committee, feeling that at
lust the time has come when the citizen may
freely and fearlessly express his individual
choice for representatives in the councils of
his party, calls' upon all those who have the
welfare of the Democratic party, as well as
the interest of our city, at henrt. to do their
utmost between now and the Sth of August
to arouse all Democratic citizens to an active
sense of appreciation of their civic duties and
privileges, to the end that a convention of in
dependent Democrats may meet to nominate
servants of the people, who will not only carry
out the letter but. the spirit of the new charter.
E. P. E. Troy vigorously opposed the
scheme to choose delegates to the County
Convention by districts. He declared that
the report did not comply with the spirit
of the law. which was intended to confer
the greatest possible measure of home rule
on the people of the city and prevent, as
far as possible, the usurpation of power
by the bosses. He maintained that under
the system outlined tn the report a man
with a* small, compact following In any
district could compel all candidates to
come to him. He thought tne precinct
plan the only one that would give all the
Democrats in the city a fair and full rep
resentation in the convention.
This view of the case was also taken by
Pat Boland. Clitus Harbour and several
other members, while M. C. Hassett took
it upon himself to champion the report in
a long speech, in which he reviewed the
history of the party in this cit" from 1882
to the present day. calling particular at
tentfon to the many disastrous defeats
which it had suffered in the past, all of
which, he said, was due to the lack of
proper organization. He argued that the
plan reported by the committee was the
best for the interests of the party and
public and others should be invoked, as
it was h^'.ieved that with their assistance
rapid progress would be made.
The chair appointed the following com
mittee of live to confer with all such so
cieties: S. M. Carr, Sheldon Sturgis,
Charles EdHman. .1. Murray Bailey and
Frank P^lliott Myers.
It was also decided to take such mea
sures as may be best for the purpose to
have incorporated In the proposed plan
and appropriation for the extension of the
park panhandle a provision to pet aside
the sum of $50,000, to help pay for the
Lincoln monument and to have the trib
ute placed If possible near the entrance
at the intersection with Van Ness ave
nue.
A. E. Saba tie's Estate.
The inventory and appraisement of the
estate of the late Alexander E. Sabatie
was filed yesterday. The estate is val
ued by the* appraisers at $135,282 12.
Justin McCarthy has a character

day's Call.
i urged its adoption. Some of Hassett's re
, marks excited the ire of Boland and Bar- :
I hour, hut the report was finally adopted j
I by a big majority. â 
Major Barna MoKinnie then offered a ,
resolution, which hr said was intended to
promote harmony in the party by giving
representation in the committee to those
factions that had been ignored when the â 
' body was originally organized, Following
is the resolution:'
Resolved, That there be traded to this com- ,
mittee such number of members ns may be
necessary to Increase to a minimum of eight j
â  the delegations from each of the eighteen As- |
sembly districts In this city and county; that ;
those "members of this committee now residing
In each Assembly district which has less than
eight members herein propose to this commit
tee at lpast sufficient names of Democrats re-
Biding in their respective districts to bring up
their representation to eight; and that there
upon this committee proceed to elect sufficient
additional members from such districts to in
crease their representation to eight as herein
I provided. ; ; '- .'.â â¢'
Hassett objected to the proposed mi
i crease in the membership of the commit- :
tee, and Ben Wright came to the rescue,
; declaring that such an Increase as was
proposed was necessary as a matter of
justice to the outsiders. Howard Parke
raised a point of order, that under the
constitution the membership could not be :
increased. The wrangle over the reso- i
, lution increased, the point of order being
temporarily lost sight of, others being
drawn into the discussion. Parke â  re
newed his point of order, but a moment
later withdrew it and subsided. All ap
. peared smooth sailing, when Leo Kauf-
man marlo tho same point that Parke had
raised, and although a determined at
tempt was made to choke him off, he in-
HisttMl on a ruling by t lie chair. While
the question was in abeyance, Sidney Van
WyCK moved that the chair appoint a
committee of three to select the sixty ad
ditional members, but his sarcastic sug
gestion was ignored.
McGee moved that the matter of legal
ity of the proposed increase he referred
to a special committee. There was no
second to the motion and Chairman Mc-
Donald at last ruled that Kaufmans
point of order was well taken.
Osgood Putnam appealed from the rul
ing of the chair, hut the appeal was lost
by an overwhelming vote.
M. B. Farrer then offered a resolution,
which was adopted, empowering the
chairman to appoint an executive com
mittee to consist of eiKhteen members c.f
the committee of one hundred, said execu
tive committee to he authorized to hire
halls and do everything necessary to fur
ther the interests of the party in the
coming campaign. The chair was given
his own time in naming the executive
committee. An adjournment was then
taken, subject to the call of the chair.
ADVERTISEMENTS.
When we read of an elephant fiunter who
has been trampled to death in the wilds of
India, we wonder at the foolhardiness of a
man who will travel round the world and
endure all manner of hardships, in order to
court death in a far away jungle. A man
does not have to make a journey to India
in order to court death in a manner equally
foolhardy.
Thousands of hard working men are daily
courting death in a much more certain
form, without ever leaving their native vil-
lages or cities. They are the men who neg-
lect their healtn. They are the men who
court death from consumption, or some
other deadly disease due to improper or
insufficient nourishment. The man who
suffers from bilious or nervous disorders,
who has a weak stomach and an impaired
digestion, who has lost the power to eat,
rest or sleep, and who fails to take prompt
steps to remedy these conditions, is court-
ing death in the guise of some fatal malady.

WHERE IMPROVEMENTS ARE NEEDED.
AT the meeting of the Board of Supervisors on
Monday Supervisor Holland introduced a
resolution calling the attention of the Mayor
and the members of the board to the numerous de
lays in the completion of the contract for the con
struction of the Hall of Justice building, and also to
the alleged discrimination in street improvements
- been practiced against that portion of ' the
civ lying cast of Kearny street and north of Cali
fornia.
The subject is one which merits all the attention
and consideration it is likely to receive. The delay
in the construction of the Hall of Justice is an old
subject of complaint In fact, it constitutes some
thing like a public scandal, and it is to be regretted
there is no way of indicting some penalty upon the
- who have been and are responsible for it.
That, however, is but a minor factor in the general
problem of providing improvement for that impor
â  ;ection of the city.
There may have been some discrimination in favor
of other districts in making public improvements, but
even if so Supervisor Holland is not justified in at
tributing it to anything else than the apathy of prop
â . ners in the district alleged to have been neg
lected. There is. of course, a continual struggle for
street improvements of all kinds, in which all sections
of the city take part, but as a rule the improvements
are made where the property-owners are most ener
getic in striving for them.
The trouble with the section of the city lying east
of Kearny and north of California is that it is under
going a transformation. It was once the center of
ss activity, and a large proportion of its build
ings were constructed to suit the retail trade and the
cftice work of what San Francisco was twenty years
ago. That sort of patronage has now deserted its old
quarters and sought the newer buildings and better
facilities that exist elsewhere. The old district re
mains to be fitted for the growing wholesale trade,
and when buildings well adapted for that purpose are
[i ted there, and the streets put in good con
dition for the heavy traffic of wholesale business, the
property will yield better profits than ever before.
It is certainly right to expect the city to do what
it can to improve that as well as other sections, but it
right to expect the property-owners to do
something for themselves. That district must be al
ways valuable. The retail trade may shift with the
passing years from one location to another, but the
wholesale trade is fixed to the water front by the
tions of its business. It will of course be
1 benefit to the whole city to have a well built
up and well paved wholesale district, and there will
rdial sympathy with any effort made to accom
plish it.
JUDICIAL CONFIRMATION.
IN The Call of Monday last the view was expressed
that the case of Hunt vs. Ward, decided by the
Supreme Court of this State and much discussed
by the bar as well as by the general public, could
be reconciled with the proposition that the consti
tutional and statutory liability of stockholders for
their proportions of bonds issued by street railway
companies would accrue when the bonds matured
and not when they were issued, and, therefore, that
the outstanding bonds of the Market Street Railway
Company and of the six pre-existing corporations
that formed parts of its consolidation had not been
divested of their essential protection.
In the case of Johnson vs. Bank of Lake, just de
cided by the Supreme Court, this opinion receives
substantial confirmation. That action was brought
to enforce against the defendant, itself a corporation,
its persona! liability as a stockholder in the Lakeport
Agricultural Association for its proportionate share
of a fee earned by an attorney. In supposed cor
respondence with the law declared in Hunt vs. Ward
it was insisted that the personal liability was complete
when the contract for sen-ices was made, and that as
the action was commenced more than three years
after that date the defendant was protected by the
Statute of limitations. The Supreme Court refuses to
recogiii/e this practical annulment of the State con
stitution and of a provision of the Civil Code, and
holds that there was no indebtedness due from the
Lakeport Agricultural Association to its attorney un
til his services had been performed, and that until
then the stockholders were not personally liable and
the statute of limitations had not begun to run in their
favor. The opinion is written by Mr. Justice Hen
shaw and concurred in by Mr. Justice Temple and
also by Mr. Justice McFarland, who wrote the
opinion in Hunt vs. Ward. In the course of a full
l>ut compact discussion of the record this language is
used: "In each case the time of the creation of the
liability is to be determined by the terms and con
ditions of the contract itself." This proposition ap
plies to street railway bonds, when originally issued,
lor by "the terms and conditions of the contract," if
the interest i^ paid, there is no principal indebtedness
due until maturity.
The judgment of the Superior Court, which har-
Toni/cd with the interpretation that has been fre
quently given to Hunt vs. Ward, was reversed. This
ruling of the appellate tribunal is consistent with
other cases referred to by The Call, to the effect that
the liability of a corporation and the personal liabil
ity of its stockholders accrue simultaneously, and is
reassuring to the holders of the street railway bonds
that elicited our comments, who, if they had to de
pend upon the mortgage securities, the value of
which is certainly decreasing, and upon insufficient
jinking funds, would be in a very precarious situa
tion. It does not, alter, however, in a financial sense,
the legal aspects of the bonded indebtedness guaran
teed and created by the Market Street Railway Com
pany.
CUBA LIBRE.
â¢ *" I "HE order issued to \>ur military authorities to
: ! disarm the people of Cuba has produced its
* legitimate effect. The people are hiding their
: arms and keeping their powder dry. We have them
under all the restraint and vexation of military gov
ernment. They have no voice in the simplest police
regulation, none in the imposition of taxes. The
fragments of Poland are not more cowed under the j
German, the Austrian and the Cossack, than Cuba \
under "the Hag of the free."
; We have quoted already from the official declara- ]
tions binding the United States, made in the speeches
of Representatives and Senators in our Congress one
year ago. These declarations cannot be forgotten.
They cannot be concealed. They cannot be de
stroyed.
Senator Morgan, referring on February 23. 1808. to i
a. former resolution of belligerency, said: "At the
1 time of that declaration the proceeding of extermina
tion by military order that had been instituted in the !
island of Cuba by General Weyler was just in process!
of development. Many of us cast anxious eyes to
the future and saw, or thought we saw. the terrible
disaster that was about to fall upon the Cuban people
in virtue of that military order. Rut the method of
! conducting that war by the Spanish Government
never imposed upon us a requirement that we should
declare that a state of war existed in the island of
Cuba, for we could not reckon among the ideas of
civilized and christianized men that extermination I
of women and children was really a state of war. It
was cruel barbarity."
The Senator then described the substitution of
Blanco for Weyler as Captain General, and of auton- i
omy for "unconditional surrender," and said: "What
has caused this result but the arms of Cuba? What
but Gomez and his soldiers 1 Not the United States
Government. It is the arms of Gomez, his strategy.!
his great genius, followed by men who are willing to I
die for liberty, that have produced this offer on the
part of Spain of autonomy, approximating, if it does
not equal, that which the Canadian Government holds
I under the crown of Great Britain. The Cubans alone
have fought and won the revolution. Mr. President,
there has been in the history of nations scarcely any
event which equals that in its importance, and 1 may
say in its grandeur. The Cubans have fought their
revolutionary war and won it. Nothing remains for
them but to hold out until the proud kingdom of
Spain will be obhged to say, 'In place of autonomy
â ye giant you independence. 1 So the Cubans have
not fought in vain. I would much prefer to witness the
rinal triumph of the Cuban arms and the establish
ment of their independence in the .-pirit that ani
mated our fathers than to have the intervention of
the United State* to assist them as we had the in
tervention of France to assist us in getting our in
, dependence." As far back as 1896 the Senate passed
this concurrent resolution: "That a condition of
public wnr exists in Cuba between the Government of
Spain and the Government of Cuba; that the
friendly offices of the United States should be offered
by the President to the Spanish Government for the
recognition of the independence of Cuba." To this
the House added: "Believing that the only perma
nent solution of the contest, equally in the interest of j
Spain, the people of Cuba and other nations, would
be in the establishment of a government by the choice
of the people of Cuba, it i> the sense of Congress
that the Government of the United States should use
j its good offices and friendly influence to that end."
I These expressions of the House and the Senate were
I quoted and approved by Senators Lodge. Teller.
: Morgan. Thurjton, Foraker and others. Concerning
i Cuban independence Thurston said the American
! people ought to be at their altars, praying for it. "si-
Itntly, solemnly, with their consciences before God."
Senator Stewart, declaring that refusing bel
; ligerent rights to Cuba, which would permit her full
acquisition and use of arms, was helping Spain, said:
"Cuban independence is assured as soon as she has
belligerent rights, so that >he can defend them. It is
said Cuba had no ships. If the United States take
its hands off, the world stands ready to sell her
ships. She has the richest island in the world; she
is practically out of debt, and they would be eager to
sell her ships and munitions of war from every part
of the world."
Concerning the arms then in the hands of the
Cubans, Senator Mason submitted documentary
proof that every rifle had cost the Cubans $200. He
drew a picture of a nation compelled by the denial of !
belligerent rights to pay that enormous price for the
guns with which to shoot its way to independence.
All this was a little more than a year ago. Now
we have taken Spain's place in the military govern
ment of that island, and the American people are
asked to send there an army large enough to com- i
pel the Cubans to disarm and surrender the rifles
which cost them $200 apiece.
We desire to say these things now, before Ameri
can volunteers are righting in the fever-smitten
swamps of Cuba to complete the work of subjugation
which Spain abandoned when she offered autonomy.
The imperialist party in this country wants war in
Cuba. It wants the people goaded into armed pro
test. It wants them provoked into "firing on the
flag," in order that it may make a hollow-hearted ap
peal to American patriotism. But over against this
stand the unbroken line of official pledges, legisla
tive and executive, to the independence and self
government of the island. Close behind these events
walks the Genius of History. Her pen recorded the
name of Lafayette in living light. It wrote that of
Washington in letters that will be read until the last
day of time. It put in words that never die Ameri
can sympathy for the Irish rebels of '98, for the pa
triots of Europe who in 1848 broke thrones and
crowns from Skager Rack to the Adriatic, and for the
Suliote. the Sepoy, the Bedouin, when they struck
blindly for freedom. Let freemen who were reared
and nurtured in the principles of the Declaration of
Independence ask what she is writing while our im
perialists are summoning the sons of the people to
die in putting down a "rebellion" in Cuba.
OILING MONOPOLY WHEELS.
THE recent developments of the methods of the
Standard Oil Company before the Industrial
Commission at Washington, D. C, are of pub
lic importance and interest. The testimony of W.
H. Clark, published in The Call of" the 9th inst., is
a striking exhibition of the power and of the facili
ties of that particular monopoly. Its success in
stifling competition and in adapting its product to
the idiosyncrasies of its customers is unexampled and
almost incredible.
This star witness turned out to be a rich lead of
valuable specimens. He furnished several unique il
lustrations of the suppression of competition as a
preliminary to raising the price of oil. In one place
a timorous dealer was driven out of business by a
threat to reduce the price to one cent per gallon, and,
as a natural consequence, ultimately took refuge in
the poorhouse. In another town, where the oil busi
ness was conducted on leased premises, the Standard
Oil Company bought the property, and. seizing a fa
vorable opportunity, carted away the building. In
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JUNE 15, 1899.
1 stiil another small city the monopoly plied its busi
ness under the disguise of the Shomaker Oil Com
i pany, which lasted after all its rivals had been sub
dued.
The company was singularly fertile in its discrimi
nations, adapted to each locality where its exclusive
' right to sell oil was asserted. When the plan was
| safe it boldly furnished oil to different persons in the j
same neighborhood at the most flexible rates. One
j man could purchase at 7 cents per gallon, while his
| next-door neighbor had to pay o'4 cents. Where it
â  was considered inexpedient to parade favoritism to
; friends and hostility toward enemies or neutrals a
uniform price was charged and differential rebates
allowed. In the town of Newark twenty-five differ
ent figures applied to twenty-five classifications of
customers were used.
But tke greatest success of the company was in its
i imitation of the tricks of the prestidigitateurs. One
eccentric character at Newark would buy no oil that
, did not come from Cleveland. The word "Cleve
j land" was painted on a red cask and he was accom
modated. This reminds us of the story of a well
known gentleman in Oregon who received a large
sum for a Durham cow. and. when twitted with the
fact that the cow was of very common blood, inno
cently replied that he had supposed her to be a Dur
ham cow because he had bought her from a man
! named Durham
In many of the Standard Oil stores in Ohio Mr.
I Clark said that the process of supplying different j
qualities nf oil was simplicity itself. Eight gra#es
' were sold out of two tanks, and to change the grade
i* was only necessary tr> turn the faucet in contrary
directions. The miracle of the conjurers who pour
: out wines of different colors and qualities from the
j same bottle was reproduced as one of the features of
! the extensive trade that has made the philanthropy
; of Mr. Rockefeller apparently as inexhaustible as his
; income and his capital.
The narrative of Mr. Clark, which includes various
facetious adulterations of a standard article, strikes
the average Californian as familiar in principle
though new in some of its facts. The railroad dis
criminations, which converted each station into a
custom-house, where duties alternated between rev- j
enue, protective and prohibitory tariffs, have been
understood and appreciated in this State for many
years. The second-hand cars and sleepers that have'
illustrated the economical administration of rail
road business, made possible by the absence or the
; destruction of competition, have induced frequent
contrasts between the West and Hast. The treat
ment of passengers and of freighters has included
every form of rudeness and urbanity, through which
Â the blessings and the curses of a soulless monopoly
could be distributed, without any distinction between
Mount Gerizim and Mount Ebal.
We suspect that there are points of resemblance
between Mr. Rockefeller and Mr. Huntingdon, and
it is deeply to be regretted that their beneficent simi
larity is incomplete.
THE TURKS AND THE CONFERENCE.
SOME signs of trouble, we are told, are visible
before the Peace Conference by reason of the
appearance at The Hague of a noted agitator
seeking to induce the conference to take some ac- j
tion in favor of Armenia against the Sultan. The I
Turkish delegates are reported to have demanded his
expulsion not only from the city hut from the Neth
-1 erlands. under a threat of retiring from the confer
ence if the demand be not granted.
In that way the old Turkish problem arises once
more to confront European diplomacy and disturb
its dreams of peace. From the very day when it was
made known that the conference would .assemble
there came from Southeastern Europe and from Asia
â  Minor the sound of revolutionists, patriots and agi
tators of all kinds making preparations to appear be
fore the conference witli clamors for redress. The j
speaker for Armenia is but the advance guard of a
host of similar agitators who will swarm at The
Hague unless prompt steps are taken to head them
off.
Some time ago there was organized in the Balkan
states a body calling itself the "Central Macedonian
Committee," which started a movement to bring
force to bear upon the conference to induce it to j
recommend a revision of the Berlin treaty and a re
organization of the Balkan states as a preliminary to
the e>tabli<hment of peace. About the same time
Montenegro began to assert claims for a reversion
of Old Servia, and talked of sending delegates to the
conference to demand the annexation of that state ',
before permanent peace should be made. Prompted, j
â  doubtless, by the general movement around them,
the Albanians broke out and for a while threatened
to cause a war without waiting for the conference.
The Central Macedonian Committee is said to
represent the aspiration of the Christians of Mace- J
donia, Thrace and Turkish Roumelia to escape from
Moslem domination by bringing about the annexa
tion of those territories with Bulgaria, thus raising
that state to one of considerable power. The Bul
garians of course would gladly co-operate with them
. in any efforts they should make for accomplishing
' the union. The forces behind the movement are
i therefore sufficiently strong to constitute a serious
menace to the existing situation.
The promoters of alj these movements in the
T!.ilkans niade the mistake of beginning too early, or
at least of announcing their intentions too early. In
formation of what was under way was conveyed to the
Czar, and he promptly took steps to prevent the pur
posed disturbance of his conference. By bringing
pressure to bear he stopped all proceedings so far
as Bulgaria. Macedonia. Montenegro and Albania
are concerned, but it seems he overlooked Armenia,
' and now a cause of disturbance comes from that
quarter.
As this is a world in which it is the unexpected that
happens, it would be quite in accord with the natural
order of things if the proceedings of the Peace Con
ference should produce so much disappointment in
the Balkans as to arouse a spirit of universal revolt
in that part of the world and thus precipitate the long
threatened war that is to involve all Europe. Certain
it i> that with these ominous warnings, sounding a
muffled accompaniment to the peace music at The
Hague, the wary war lords of the nations are not
i likely to agree to disarmament or even to the set
tlement of all international questions by arbitration.
Harry Fisher, a Brooklyn welter-weight, was hit
in the breadbasket Monday night by "Mistah" Joe

The gas company has again shown its solicitude

MASCOT OF THE
20TH INFANTRY
ARTHUR GLI'CKMANN, thirteen
years of age. who had the dis
tinction of being the "mascot"
of the Twentieth Infantry, re
turned from Manila on the transport
St. Paul yesterday and is now at the
family residence, 2126 Bush street. He
was wounded in the left knee by an
insurgent bull^j; and confined in the
hospital for seventeen days.
He is a bright, manly little fellow
and tells his experiences with the army
at the front with hearty outbursts of
laughter. His being wounded and the
fact that he was introduced to Ad
miral Dewey are to him as ordinary
occurrences. His story is best told i
his own words:
"I left San Francisco for New York
last September with the First New
York Volunteers. I had a desire to see
the world and thought that was the
beat way to do it. I camp back here on
January 26th last and left on the same
day with the Twentieth Tnfantry on
the transport Scandia. now the War
ren. The hoys immediately made me
their 'mascot.' and treated me splen
didly. My father and mother. did not
know where T was, so when we arrived
at Honolulu I wrote to them saying 1
was going to Manila.
"I saw action at Caliente. Malolos,
Fagbasc River, r a lumplt and nt Appal
lette. which was tlie last engagement
of the Filipino war. It was at Callente
that r was wounded. On March 16 we
were suddenly attacked by the insur
gents and we were told to lay low.
The bullets were whistling around us
pretty thickly and we were given the
order to advance by the right flank. I
suddenly discovered that I had lost
my revolver and remarked to a man
next to me that he would have to give
me his if T was disabled. We came to
a small river and I got on a soldier's
back and got across. While we were
running ft bullet plowed up the ground
a foot away from me. and some one
said it was a pretty close shave. I an
swered "It was all right.' and at that
moment I felt a sharp sensation in my
left leg .iust above the knee, and 1
knew I had beeÂ»i hit. Here Is the
bullet hole in my trousers now. Dr.
McCollum cut out the bullet and a few
days later the chaplain of the Thir
teenth Minnesota presented it to me as
a memento.
"I had anotner narrow escape on March 15th. "WV had crossed the Pasig
River and were ;?oing up trie road when a man was shot right alongside of me.
I went into a house t<> Investigate a little, and when I opened a window
twenty rifles from as many American BOldiers wei leveled at me. They took
me for a Filipino. The major doctor of the regiment ylled out 'Don't shoot;
it's our mascot!'
"I had the pleasure of shaking hands with Admiral Dew ey, and there is
one thing I would like to say; his pictures don't look a bit like him. They
never get his mustache just right. I slept on tin- flagship on thp night of May
Ist. the anniversary of thÂ«- big enga^prr.^nt. you know. The next day Dewty
took me oujt in his launch. I forg n to say that when he first met me he
said, 'Who is this little lad? 1
"They told him I was the mascot of the Twentieth Infantry, and he re
plied: 'I am very glad to meet you.' "
Master Gluckmann is already making plans for the fir-ire and unless pre
vented by his parents will likely carry them out. He saya that he Intends to
work for Douglas Young, the United States agent for the Manila Freedom,
who is now in this city.
The mascot, clad in his rf-gimental p. took his little sister to the Orpheum
last night and attracted a great deal of attention.
A PROTEST IN THE NAME OF TRUTH
Addressed to Governor Roosevelt and all who support the policy of which he
is so distinguished an advocateâ "ln the tropical, withering heat of the Philip
pines, fighting for the glorious flag wilh the .same motive you Grand Army men
fought with in 1864, are your sons find their comrades." Taken from Governor
Roosevelt's speech at General Grant's tomb at Claremont, New York. May 30, 1599.
L'rg*-, if you will, the vowth of this broad land
K< â i.-kleas the ora, familiar way to tread
The blood-stained path of conquest seeking gain.
But pluck no laurels from our patriot dead.
Theirs was no trader's greed; no thirst for rule;
In the fierce heat of fratricidal strife
They faced a foe as valiant as themselves
And gave their own to save a nations life.
For the bright hope of human brotherhood.
Creed â  â ( brave hearts in every clime to-day.
The "ethics of the jungle" substitute
And ape the tiger eager for his prey.
Stil! prate of glory while you kill for gain;
The mighty work our fathers wrought undo;
Incito the strong to trample on the weak;
Oppress the many to enrich the few.
Send forth, like vultures scenting carrion.
Our hosts to slay beneath a tropic sun.
But let them claim no kin with those who fought
To free the slave, to keep our country one.

ERRORS IN BASEBALLâ J. G. S-, Sac
ramento, Cal. It is not an error in base
ball when a ball is batted to a man if it
simply touches his hands and he does
not hold it, but it is an error if he re
ceives a ball fairly and he does not
hold it. .
FARMING AND MERCANTILEâ A. B.
D., Oakland, Cal. It was estimated that
on the Ist of last January the population
of the State of California was 1.408,130.
There are no statistics showing what the
proportion of the farming and the mer
cantile class is, and will not be until the
! next census is taken.
BEAUTIES OF THE RAMBLERâ R.
S.. City. There is no market price for
such books as "The Beauties of the Ram
bler," by G. Kearsley, 1787. Such a work
is worth just what any librarian would
be willing to pay for it should he desire
it, and much would depend on the condi
tion and scarcity of the work.
TOO INDEFINITEâ F. A., Philo, Cal.
The description furnished of the silver
coin you are possessed of Is too indefinite
to admit of its identification. Persons
asking questions about coins must fur
nish a full description of the inscription
and date, and better still, send a rubbed
proof of the coin, which can be obtained
by rubbing a pencil on a piece of paper
held firmly on the coin.
ASKING TOO MUCHâ W. F. M., Napa,
Cal. There are no aggregate or figures
to show the amount of taxes paid in the
State of California "on the entire wine
business, the fruit business in all its
branches and on all kinds of mining." To
obtain this information would necessitate
the searching of the books of county offi
cers of each county in the State and the
seggregation of the value placed on each
industry.
NAVAL VOLUNTEERâ Anxious Moth

zens of California will, through the Na
tive Sons of the Golden West, present to
the volunteers, will be given to all volun
teers who enlisted in the State of Cali
fornia, whether in the army or navy. The
idea is expressed by the committee having
charge of the matter is "to present a
medal and certificate to every man .who
enlisted In the State of California' for
service in the late war with Spain, re
gardless of where he was born and irre
ppiMUive of the fact whether he saw
actual service or not. It Is sufficient
that he enlisted for service."

A PROFESSIONAL LITIGANT.
T. Fox Knocked Out in His Suit
Ag-ainst John Mackay.
The Supreme Court does not take much
stock In the position assumed by Theo
dore Vox against John W. Mackay et al.
In fact, it practically brands him as a
"professional litigant" and upholds the
judgment of the lower court, which was
adverse to the plaintiff. Fox brought this
action as a dissatisfied stockholder and
on behalf of the Consolidated California
& Virginia Mining Company. Mackay and
John P. Jones were the real defendants.
By the bill conspiracy is charged against
Mackay and Flood, the latter now de
ceased, against the company. The fraud
alleged consisted of the purposely care
less milling of ores so as to defraud the
company. In the lower court the findings
of fact were strong against the plaintiff,
and it was upon an assault upon the
findings that the case reached the Su
preme Court. The latter tribunal, In the
decision handed down yesterday, says:
"Defendants also urged "certain 'grounds
is fatal to plaintiff's cause of action. It
was claimed that plaintiff was not a
stockholder upon the books of the mining
corporation at the times these various
frauds were alleged to have been com
mitted. It is said that the record dis
closes plaintiff to be a mere speculator
and professional litigant, making this
class of litigation a specialty, ana that
he purchased these five shares of the
stock of the corporation for the sole pur
pose of giving him a status as a party
plaintiff, and that therefore he has come
into a court of equity with bad motives.
*.â¢;.:* The record largely justifies the
claim of defendants as to the somewhat
equivocal position plaintiff occupies in this
case."
A similar case by Fox against Mackay
and Jones, alleging fraud in the milling
of a certain lot of ores, was similarly dis
posed of. â¢

PRESENTATION CONVENT
GRADUATING EXERCISES
Four Young Ladies
Presented With
Diplomas.
THE thirtieth annual commence
ment exercises of the Sacred
Heart Presentation Convent were
held yesterday afternoon at the
school edifice on Taylor and Ellis
streets.
The hall had been prettily decorated
for the occasion and seated on onf/pide
of the ptagre were the young misses
who had finished their collegiate
course. They were Miss Evelyn Drady,
MiSs Edna Montgomery, Miss Julia
Doody and Miss Josephine Creem, and
formed a pretty picture in their dainty
white costumes. On the other side of
the stage were the scholars of the
lower classes who expect some day to
receive their diplomas.
Very Rev. Vicar General Prender
gast represented the Archbishop and
presented the diplomas and prizes to
the young ladies. He delivered an
address to the graduating class in
which he referred to their having fin
ished their school work, but the more
Important consideration of their life
work was now In order. He cautioned
them to remember the teachings of the
good sisters who had labored tirelessly
in their behalf, and also urged them
to remain true to the principles of

HOW THE PALACE
MIXED UP IN TAR
FLAT POLITICS
New Power in the Old
Twenty- Eighth.
MAXWELL'S POLITICAL NIGHT
A CIVIC HERO IN WHITE VEST
AND HIS CIRCUS.
The Results of a Dash for Good Gov-
eminent on the Unterrifled
Democracy Beyant the
Palace.
"When the old Twenty-eighth, awakes to
campaign glory the campaign may be de
clared open. It hag wakened and it's a
three-ring circus. Some time ago the
Buckleyites got a strong club going under
the leadership of Larry Conlon.
A few days ago Gavin licNab derided
that it was time to organize the "decent
element" with which to win the district.
J. D. Maxwell was picked out for chair
man and Michael Brown for secretary.
When Mr. Maxwell was consulted he
would say. "Mr. McNab thinks this," and
"Mr. McNab says that."
Now J. D. Maxwell is a nice and good
man. He is a prominent insurance man,
lives in the Palace Hotel, and is a stran
ger to the turbulence of primary politics
on Tar Flat. After reflecting on the du
ties of citizenship and the political millen
nium which the primary law has ushered
in he agreed that it was nis duty to take
a brave hand in local politics in the inter
est of good government.
He realized that he could be a power
for civic righteousness in the Palace
Hotel where several Democrats reside. He
worked on James V. Coleman and Joe To
bin, and they agreed to also do their
work and hold their places in primary
politics. Thus was the Palace Hotel
dragged Into the arena of primary poli
tics at last. It has hummed with politics
before and politics sizzle there now, but
primaries have been as strange to it as
st'-am beer. It has never thrilled with the
joy of barricaded ballot boxes. It is said
that some of the Democrats of the Palace,
with the grace of the Stratton primary
I,'iw in their hearts, proposed to have one
precinct polling place in the hotel itself as
a striking object lesson on the regenera
tion of municipal politics.
Larry Hoey of the Committee of One
Hundred was brought into the prelimin
aray conferences, as was John Ferris of
the Assessor's office, where Mr. McNab is
credited with Influence. One of the pol
itical powers In the Twenty-eighth is John
F. MeOovern. long secretary of the Com
mittee of Four Hundred and Fifty and
now wharfinger at the Main-street wharf
in his district. He represents a large ele
ment, and in consultation was assured
that only complete harmony was wanted
and that the interests of his faction would
be fully recognized. Notices for the meet-
Ing at Second and Folsom streets were
sent out a w>-ek ago yesterday evening.
Meantime Mr. MeGovern and his friends
decided that it would be just as safe to
have some voting strength on hand, and
workers were sent out to "round up the
gang." The organizers did likewise and
the little hall was packed. Heroes of
many a primary were there in numbers.
Larry Hoey called the meeting to partial
order and J. D. Maxwell was quickly
nominated and elected temporary chair
man per programme. The new political
leader came, out on the little stage in a
white vest and other correct evening at
tire and spoke feelingly of the duties he
and they owed to themselves, to their
city, to the country and to Thomas Jeffer
son.
"Who's this dude that comes down here
wid a white vest to teach us politics?"
growled some of the unterrified.
"I move you. sir. that the chair appoint
a temporary secretary," said John Ferris,
quickly.
"Nof^No!" and "Second the motion!
came the roar.
Now herein appears a trick in primary
rious numbers. The musical selections
on piano, organ, mandolin, guitar and
banjo came in for a large share of ap
preciation, and in fact the whole pro
gramme, which was as follows, was
of a very high order of merit:
Duet "three pianos)
"Marehe aux Flambeaux"
Misses A. Cotter, C. Donovan, A. Slattery,
M. Guerin, A. Leo, A. Thompson.
Chorus "The Sacred Heart"
Recitation "Briar Rose"

politics flint the primary law can't reach.
"hen a district club, that lias the naming
of a primary ticket, is organized the Bec
retary, being the custodian of the club
roll, becomes an Important factor. He is
"the works.'" McGovern had been told
that he would be '-done up." and Relieved
his friends could elect a secretary.
Chairman Maxwell managed to call for
â  the ayes and noes, which came in two
great roars. "The ayes have it. I ap
! point Mr. Michae] Hrown as temporary
secretary. " declared Chairman Maxwell.
Then the storm burst. Larry Buckley's
meeting voice arose. McGovern sprang to
i the stage and appealed from the decision
;of the chair. "Are you, Democrats of this
; Twenty-eighth District, going to swallow
| a programme < ked up in Gavin Mc-
Nab's office yesterday?" he roared.
"No-o! No-o!"
Larry Hoey put the appeal, after many
: words about the method. So many were
| standing that a rising vote wouldn't work.
A show of hands was decided on.
"Sixty-two," said Hoey on counting the
ayes. Then he counted the brawny votes
in the negative. McGoverji'a friends
swear there were S.n. "The chair is sus
tained." declared Hoey, in the interest of
good government, a la Phelan, without
stating the vote.
The storm hurst again. The McGovern
faction crowded with uproar toward the
stage, shouting. "You're a liar!" and
"Throw him out!" The chairman was
; about the only one there not used to
every-day politics in the old Twenty -
' eight, and he quickly retreated to the
wings of the little stage and peeked out
at danger.
The trouble soon ended by the Mr-Gov
ern faction bolting to a little adjoining
hall, where they quickly organized an in
â  dependent cluh by electing Attorney J. J.
Greeley chairman. Lurry Buckley, vice
chairman and ex-Assemblytaan E. F.
1 Lacy secretary. They then adjourned
! and smiled because they felt good. They
i felt that they had the strength and the
j others would have to come to them. Since
â¢â  then efforts have been ma.de to patch up a
, peace, hut McGovern is in no nurry and
jls letting things develop. One of the pos
sibilities is a combination with the Buck
ley wing. If the progragmmers do not
come to time with concessions. Many of
thÂ« Buekleyites wept at hearing of the
i proceedings. If they had only known and
fone. just to get in a crack at the hated
IcXah faction by helping out McGovern
just for luck ami fun!
Mr. Maxwell went home with further
i reflections on the duties of citizenship.
"The Palace!" say* Larry Conlon, with
; scorn. "I'll take forty feet of Minna
j street and wipe it off the earth."
Chinamen May Not Be Naturalized.
Port Collector Jackson has been notified
of the following ruling of the Treasury j
Department:
"You are advised that it was held In re
Gee Hip <7 Fed. Rep. 274) that a native of j
China of the Mongolian race is not en- !
titled to be admitted to naturalization; j
that a certificate of naturalization issued
to a Chinaman is void on its face and j
that a passport issued by the Department i
of State is not evidence that the person i
to whom it was issued was a citizen of
the I'nited States."
Small Damages Awarded.
The second t<uit of George D. Graybill
against M. H. de Young, proprietor of
the Chronicle, to recover damages for
libel, was concluded before Judge Hunt
yesterday. The jury after being out some
time returned and entered judgment in
favor of the plaintiff for the sum of $1.

CANNERY TRUST MAY
SOON BE REALIZED
OPTIONS ON TWO-THIRDS OF THE
BIG ESTABLISHMENTS.
All That Remains Is Final Consum
mation of the Deal â Some Big
Houses Have Not En
tered the Combine.
Trust upon trust is the order of the
business world to-day. The newest syn
dicate about to be formed on this coast
embraces the major number of big can
nery establishments in this State.
For the pact few months Chickering.
Thomas & Gregory have been at work
perfecting the outlines of a cannery trust '
and their efforts have so far met with !
success, for they have secured on behalf
of their principals an option on two
thirds of the canneries in this State.
Those establishments which have come
into the combine are: Fontana & Co.'s
San Francisco. Healdshurg and Hanford
cannery: Cutting Packing Company's
three canneries, .situated In this city,
Santa Rosa and Santa Maria; King-
Morse Canning Company's two canneries,
situated in this city and San Leandro;
Sacramento Packing Company's three!
canneries, situated in Sacramento, Yen- |
tura and Visalia: Balfour-Guthrie's two!
canneries, situated in Biggs and in Oak- i
land; Oakland Preserving Company's two
canneries, situated in Oakland and Mil
pitas; San Jose Packing Company's two
cannerieF, situated in San Jose "and in
Marysville; the Carquinez Packing Com
pany' * cannery, situated at Benlcia; A. ;
F. Tenney Company's cannery, situated!
at Fresno; Hunt Bros. Packing Com- j
pony's cannery, situated at Hay wards;
Rose City Canning Company's cannery.
Situated at Santa Rosa; Russian River \
Packing Company's cannery, situated in ;
Healdsburg; Sebastopol Packing Com
pany, situated in Sevastopol; Napa Vai- ;
ley Packing Company, situated in Napa,
and Hood Canning Company, situated in
Emeryville.
There are a number of canneries which
have hold out and have so far refused to
join hands with the combination. Their
output reaches a big portion of the year
ly supply and they will figure as potent
rivals to the combination should they per
sist in their present declination to make
one of it.
The annual output of those canneries
which have joined in a trust is estimated
at about 2.000,000 cases, which amounts i
to over 100,000,000 pounds of fruit. The
capitalization of the trust company Is
fixed at $3,000,000. To those canners who
Join the syndicate a lump sum will be
paid and also a proportionate amount of
the capital stock. The organizers of the
trust disclaim any intention upon the part j
of their principals to raise prices. They i
claim that there will merely be a greater
economy exercised in the operation of
the plants and less expense in the pro
ductiaj of canned goods.
Inventor Edison explains how he
hit upon the idea of the electric light
in next Sunday's Call.

THE SITUATION IN WALL STREET.
The circular of Henry Clews says:
"Some surprise has been caused by shipments
of gold during the week, outside the ordinary
course of exchange. The remittances, aggre
gating $5,500,000, have been chiefly made by one
bank, and that institution is the one which
negotiated the settlement of the Spanish in
demnity. Interest has centered more In the
motive of the transaction than in Its Import
ance, for it is not regarded as foreshadowing
any continuous or Important export of specie
Pi r as being of any great significance to the
Juture of the money market, but as being
merely a transient incident. There are various
obvious ways In which the transaction might
be connected with the Spanish settlement. As
Spain was paid mainly through the transfer
ence of American funds held by European
banks, it is not at all Inconceivable how some
of the great foreign Institutions might need
to replenish their stocks of gold depleted by
the operation, or desire to renew the loans from
American banks which they have been required
to liquidate In connection with the war pay
ment, and the gold exports have probably been
largely attendant on BUCh readjustments.
"The crop outlook has not materially
changed. In some sections the weather has
be^n favorable and in others unfavorable, the
general situation consequently remaining about
as it was two weeks ago. Between the recov
ery In the European crops and the decline In I
ours, we may look for not only a reduction j
in the quantity of our cereal exports, as com- j
pared with the last two years, but also possibly j
a lower range of pr - for food products. The j
surplus of exports over imports may continue i
lnrpe â -â  ugh to prevent any Important exports
r f gold for some time to come, but it is reason
able to expect an ultimate return to a normal
condition of our foreign trade balance.
"The declaration of the usual quarterly divi
dend by the American Bus Company removes
a doubt that has- hung over the market for
quite a long period and played Into the hands j
of the bears, and they have used it from time |
to time in the most skillful way to depress
values. The payment of this dividend has suf
ficed to call attention to the Innumerable num
ber of others which will follow in quick suc
cession between now and the first of July, the j
aggregate amount of which Is estimated for this â 
year at about $150.'W>.000â by far the largest on |
record. A very considerable part of this money
is not unlikely to be reinvested by the recipients
In the very properties that pay them. What
stronger recommendation can be made In be
half of these properties than their dividend- !
I'aylns qualities as demonstrated In this way?" ]

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW Y'.RK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK. June 14.â professional
boardroom traders, whoseeffort Is to keep in the
current of events for a short turn In prices,
were kept in a very unsettled frame of mind !
to-day by the frequent ebb and flow of prices, I
and they were left In a state of confusion '
at the close under the puzzling conflict of
currents In the market. Some rather large In
terests evidently took their profits on the re
cent rlso yesterday, and having done so, were
read) to avow the fact this morning. This
brought active following from outside sources.
and the commission houses were sellers of the ''
general list. But those who sold stocks freely
in the late flurry yesterday were buyers at
the decline for the purpose of recovering their
Fhort contracts, Â»â < that the belated liquida
tion was pretty well absorbed. In fact, the
covering by the shorts and large buying of some '
of the high-priced specialties carried prices gen
erally alter the opening, above last night's
level. But weak spots began to develop, not
ably in Sugar, Metropolitan and the smelting
stocks, the latter on the prospect of labor
troubles, and a general selling movement set
in. Anaconda, Continental Tobacco, P. C. C.
and St Louis, Baltimore and Ohio. Colorado
and Southern first preferred. International
Paper and the steel stocks, which were advanced I
yesterday, were all special points of weakness
at different times during the day. On the
other hand, the Flower specialties, especially
Brooklyn Transit and Federal Steel, were well '
sustained and showed a disposition to advance. j
Sugar, also after dropping err nearly three I
points, developed an aggressive upward ten
dency and rose an extreme six points. Man
hattan was another center of strength. Thii
deterred the bfars from making new ventures
on the short Â»i ie, although the early advances
wc-re not well maintained. The market was
In fact, a waiting one, in the exact sense of
the word, and fell Into extreme dullness late
in the clay. The quick rally of 44 points in I
Metropolitan Street Railway, after dropping I
84. and Shk in Sugar, lifted the level of prices
from the low plane to which they had been
dragged during the afternoon and made the
close comparatively firm. Only a few stocks
showed net gains, fractional net losses being
the rule. The expected dividend declaration
on Northern Pacific common, which was an
nounced shortly after 2 o'clock, gave that
stock some strength. Otherwise, the grain
carrying roads were. Inclined to heaviness on
talk of harm done by the rains. Denver pre
ferred and the Southwestern generally were
conspicuously weak. The banks were rather
more exacting In granting loans called during
the day. and this led to more attention being
given to the outlook in the money market. The
conditions are much easier In London, where
the effect on the stock market was beneficial
and this lessens the prospect of a further Im
mediate outflow of gold.
There was a reactionary tendency manifest
at some points In the bond market, and the
volume of business done was only moderate*
Total sales, par value, $2,545,000. "I
I Government bonds were unchanged.

BOSTON wool MARKET.
BOSTON, June 14.â The American Wool and
Cotton Reporter will say to-morrow: The wool
market has continued strong and active during
the past week, although the volume of busi
ness actually transacted Is slightly less than
that of the previous week. More wool could
have bean sold If holders had been willing to
make concessions, and consumers, who have
done most of the buying during the past week,
have In most Instances been obliged to pay full
prices for the stock which they secured. Con
tinued large sales of territory wool are report
ed, some of which were purchased by dealers.
In the country there Is as much as ever and
prices are advancing all along the lln?. For
eign wools are strong but quiet.
The sales of the week In Boston amounted to
4,475.600 pounds domestic and 504.000 pounds
foreign, making a total of 4,979,600 pounds,
against a total of 1 426,000 pounds for the cor
â¡ding week of last year. Sales since Jan
uary 1, 1899. ; amounted to 111.*>69,800 pounds,
against 52,869,310 pounds last year.

WHEATâ usual stereotyped news of dam
age In Russia came through, and as usual pro
duced but indifferent effect. In Southern Rus
sia, large areas of the crop were reported so
badly damaged that It will not be worth har

Sea district. Berlin cabled a more favorable
outlook In Russia.
The Chicago market met with poor support

PROFESSOR FERDINAND STARK DEFENDS HIMSELF
AGAINST A DRESS SUIT AND TWO TAILORS
T->ROFESSOR FERDINAND STARK

has a new dress suit' but he does
J not like it. The coat does not lit
In the back, he says, and the vest
â hows a strange, and unaccountable
reluctance to meet the trousers half
way. There are also other defects,
all of which the professor pointed out
to Justice of the Peace Barry yester
day afternoon In defense of such of his
acts as have grown out of his dislike
for the suit, and to the confusion of
the tailors who fashioned it. On the
other hand, the tailors express a mod
est degree of pride In the garments
they have made to cover the manly
form of the professor. Incidentally,
they want the professor to take the
suit and .-give them $55, which sum,
they, assert, would be a beggarly but
satisfactory, recompense for their la
bor. At the same time they ask that
the professor be compelled to pay the
additional sum of 12 50 In return for
labor expended In reinforcing the back
breadths of his very-day trousers. To
enforce their demands they found It
necessary to enter suit, and It was this
suit that engaged the attention of
Judge Barry and a number of Inter
ested spectators yesterday afternoon.
As a preliminary. Messrs. Bernard
& Leger, the complaining tailors, ex
plained to the Judge the details of the
verbal contract whereby Professor
THE SAN FRAKCISCO CALL, THUESDAY, JtTNE 15, 1899.
SCHOOL BOARD
IS SCORED BY
DIRECTOR HEAD
Objects to Star Cham
ber Sessions.
The Board of Education at its meeting
laÂ«t night v.iis treoted to an artistic
"rofnÂ«t!ng" at tho bands of Director Head.
i He termed tlio executive sessions of the
hoard "dark lantern sessions" and very
strongly intimated that the sessions were
secret in order to facilitate the transac
tion of "crooked work.'
Practically the entire business of tho
present Board of Education has up to the
present time been transacted behind
closed doors. This has given rise to much
complaint and many whispered accusa
i tions, and it has come to be generally un
derstood that the majority of the mem
-I'Â»t> of the board are either afraid or
ashamed to allow the public to sec them
in tho act of determining what course
shall be taken regarding public business.
T-ast evening, a? soon as the minutes of
1 the previous meeting had been read. Su
, perlntendent Webster asked that the
board resolve Its. -If Into a committee of
i the whole .-uiil n*> into executive ses
sion. This w;;s too much for Director
1 Head, who expressed himself as follows:
"It has become customary for this
board to resolve Itself Into a commit
! tee of the whole for tho purpose of
transacting the business of tho board
! . in secret session. Our business should
be done it; the open- that is. if we
have anything to do of which we are
1 nol ashamed.
"At the last session of this board it
i went into Becret session and consid
ered bids for the painting of certain
BChoolhouses. The result of that dark
1 lantern meeting was to let the con
tract to a bidder who was not the
i lowest bidder. This action was taken
on the bare statement of one of the
i members of the board that the lowest
bidder was irresponsible. I have since
i been informed that the statement was
not founded on fact.
1 'The taxpayers of this city are enti
tled to know how the business of this
department of the city government is
i conducted, and I protest against these
Becret me. -tings."
Director Head said much more to the
same effect, and taken altogether he gave
the members a very uncomfortable five
minutes.
The contract for painting to which he
i referred was let to C. Brooks, although
A. Gottung was the lowest bidder on two
: of the three schoolhouses bid upon.
The motion to go Into executive session
was put and all members except Director
Head voted in th>' affirmative.
Contracts for furnishing supplies to the
School Department were awarded to the
following firms: Bennett Bros., James a.
Snook & Co., \v. P. (Tuner <k Co.. Fates
& Co., Whitaker .^- Ray Company, Cun
ningham. Curtiss <t Welch, Payot, Up
ham & Co., 11. S. Crocker & Co., Sanborn,
Vail & Co., Sampson Brush Company, At
lantic Brush Company, C. F. 'Weber &
Co., Thomas Morton, t:. Peabody and
I George H. Fuller Desk Company.
The Building and Grounds Committee
recommended that all bids or lumber be
| rejected on th.- ground that all bids were
; too high. Director Head objected to this
: course, and asked that the bidders be
given an opportunity to be heard. On
motion the bids were re-referred to the
committee.
The contract for furnishing ink and pa
: per gave rise to another controversy. Th^
successful bidder was Payot. I'phum &
Co., though the {-rices named by this tirm
were not the lowest submitted. Director
Kemp asserted that the name ink quotpd
, by Payot. fpham & Co. at 60 cents was
; quoted by Brown <<.- Power, anotner bid
der, at 6C nts, He also assorted that the
: expert on paper, whose opinion was taken
I by the committee to whom the bids were
submitted, Ls the local agent of t..e paper
he declared to be the best and which was
accepted by the committee at tl 2f>. where
as o!h>r bidders quoted price aw low as 90
; cents. Director Kemp proved his asser
tions by the presentation of letters anil
. other documents. Director Gedge, who is
] a member of the supplies committee
sweetly repudiated the Inference that '
there had been any favoritism shown, and
after a long wrangle the. report of the
committee was adopted, Directors Head
and Kemp voting no.
The following resolutions were adopted:.
Resolved, That pupils of the Fourth
Fifth. Sixth. Seventh and Eighth
grades who failed to secure the mini
mum of 60 per cent in not more than
two subjects In tho recent examina
tions may be re-examined in said sub
jects on July 31. August 1 and August
Stark agreed to separate himself from
the nini of $,"5 In return for one. dress
suit of perfect fit and the latest ntyle.
The suit having been builded us per
contract, the professor began to ques
tion the accuracy <>f their measure
ments and to cast slurs upon their pro
fessional knowledge of the gentle art
of tailoring. He finally flatly refused
to take the suit and just as flatly de
clined to pay for it.
At this stage of the proceedings the
Suit was produced and a recess of live
minutes ordered In order to give the
professor time to retire to the Judge's
chamber? and attire himself In the dis
puted garments. His return to the
courtroom created a decided sensation.
The interest of the spectators was not
allowed to cool, for the professor
mounted the witness stand and pointed
out to the Judge with great delibera
tion and much attention to detail the
defects of which he had complained.
He Was then turned -.ver to two expert
tailors who had been called by the
prosecution, and subjected to a most
critical examination. They patted him
on the back, jabbed him in the ribs
and twisted him about, after the man
ner of tailors who know their business
;i ad are glad of it.
This ordeal being ended, the profes
sor was allowed to retire again to the
sacred precincts of the Judge's bou

Little Hope for Perry.
Frank Perry, over whose shooting at 107
Guerrero street there remains an en
shrouded mystery, is very low at St.

but slim hopes of paving his life.
The United States a Power for Good.
A distinguished historian writes, while re
ferring to this nation's advent as a colonizing
power, that we represent the "century's polit
ical conscience," and that our influence for
good over European spheres will be Immense.
This result was just aa inevitable as is the
cure which follows the use of Hostetter's
Stomach Bitters, the great remedy which is
found in every home and drug store through
out the country. It cures indigestion, constipa
tion, overworked kidney and liver, allays nerv
ousness, and tones up the whole system.

BURNS USES THE LASH
ON THE HEALTH OFFICE
The Physicians Rebel at the
Mexican's Medicine.
Plot to Seat Leon Dennsry After O.her Favorites Are
-Threat to Reduce Appropriations.
Dr. Keeney's Bitter Pill.
THERE !b perhaps in the State no
â  unhappy political family
than the newly elected Board of
alth. The members are di
vided against each other; they
ire wincing under the lash of Burns;
hey are menaced by the dangerous
hrf-ats of the enemies of the Mexican,
id they art- oppressed by demands
igainst which their decency and self
espect have ris^n in rebellion. The
â¢ uy to the board is still
:' war. although around it
i ihtiv minor issues and contro-
Dan 'iurns insists that Leon
shall ie elected secretary. This
I 's nothing more nor less ihan
in insult to the members of the new
loard. While they have agreed to sub
nit to the Intolerant domination of
'.urns they naturally ask the privilege
if retaining their decency.
Their friends have united with them
st against the outrage of se
?cting such a man as Derm try as s â â¢ -
etary. Dr. Barbat owes his election
to Burns, as he is the family
hysician of the Mexican. Dr. Barbat
1 ' T'-iWirally obey the instructions of
urns, but his friends plead that he
hould not be submitted to the indig
associating th<> name of Den
h his own. Dr. Payne admits
hat hÂ» is Indebted to Major Frank
lULaughlin for his position, but the
of Dr. Payne insist that he
hould not b" forced to vote for a man
i hos>' reputation is such that even Mc-
AUghlin would not dan- discuss it
monsr decent men.
L'r. Keeney Is a member of the new
toard by virtue of his relationship to
Villiam Alvord, and the well wishers
if 1 >r. Keeney insist that he has the
from his official house
lold a man whose name would be a
profanation in his home. It was by the
d of William F. Herrln that Dr.
Njffey U-came a member of the Board
if Health, but notwithstanding this
act the young physician still retains
tion worth losing. His friends
ieclare that he Bhould not be

REUNION OF FORMER
TUOLUMNE RESIDENTS
ASSOCIATION WILL MEET AT
SONORA ON SATURDAY.
Arrangements Perfected for a. Gr?nd
Celebration of the Thirty-First
Anniversary of the Or
sranizÃtion.
j no rommiuce oi arrangements or the
Tuolumne Reunion elation held a
meeting las.t night and perfected the final
plans for its grand ration at Sonora
on Saturday, June 17. The association
has been giving these reunions ever since
1868, when the anniversary, which falls
on the .same date as that of Bunker Hill,
Wfis celebrated in Oakland.
Chairman L. L* Nelson announced that
fifty Tuolumnites ad left this city yes
terday afternoon for Sonora. One hun
dred will leave this morning and over 300
are going to-morrow evening, _ accom
panied by a military band. A committee
will rome down to Stockton to meet them
and on arriving at Sonora the citizens of
Tuolumne will give the visitors a rousing
reception. A chorus of 100 young ladies,
Knyly attired in white dresses, will sing
a welcome song especially composed for
the occasion.
The programme for the day in Sonora
includes a grand barbecue at Marengo
Park. Then? will be literary and musical
exercises, Bides open-air concerts and
dancing day and night. The music will
be furnished by the SoulÃbyvllle and
Sonora bands. a parade composed of the
civic societies, the school children and
members of the association will form at
the old opera hall at 9 o'clock in the
morning and march to the park.
The county Supervisors have contrib
uted a substantial sum to insure the suc
cess of the celebration.
The transportation committee, consist-
Ing or" United States Marshal Shine, L. L.
Nelson and Mrs. C. P. Ford, has made ar
rangements with the railroad for reduced
rates from specified points, the round
trip fare to Honors having been placed
at $7, with return limit until June 30, 1899.
It is calculated that there will be over
2000 visitors to Sonora and it will be a
gala day in the history of the county.

Sfeeterday's Bankrupt
S. B. Burt and S. J. Locher, creditors of
Ed Woolbridge of Auburn, Placer County,
filed a petition In the United States Dls
the Almshousp and the resident phy- |
slcian of the City and County Hospital j
have been elected then the secretary j
will he chosen and there Is everything :
to suggest that he will be Leon Den- j
nery, the type and representative of \
the unspeakable phases <>f the tender- j
loin.
In order to delude the members of ;
the Hoard of Health and the public a j
coin promise candidate for secretary to I
the board han been placed In the field, j
Up Is E. B. Carroll of Sacramento. Mr.
Carroll has the distinction of being a
relative of George Crocker. As one of'
x the obligations of that relationship he
is being made the foil of Leon Dennery ',
to advanVe the political interests of
Dan Burns.
While Burns has been struggling
with his refractory creatures on the
board he has bÂ»en menaced from an
other source. The city department of
health as now administered includes j
over 150 employes more than those pro
vided by State statute. The Board of |
Supervisors is compelled to provide j
only for the statutory officers and may j
restrict its appropriation to a provision
Â£or these officers. This would mean
that the present board would receive
an appropriation of approximately
$26.f>00 instead of $70,000 if the Board of
Supervisors <ared to exercise its power
of restriction. The bulk of patronage
possessed by the Board of Health
would thus be destroyed and Burns
would be forced to a new shift to pro
vide for his followers.
Thi'Sf that have Influence with the
Supervisors and object to the demand
of Burns that he shall make the city
pay his political debts threaten to cut
the appropriation for the Board of
Healt-h to the statutory limit. In re- j
ply Burns threatens to command his
Board of Health to o!osÂ« its department
and leavp the city without its hospitals
and manifold system of health. If such j
a threat were carried imo execution an !
untold evil would be inflicted upon the [
city. The threat of the M>-\i<an shows j
to what desperate limit he will go to j
win his point in his political game.
More than this. Burns has threatened
to remove any member of the Board of .
Health that does noi obey his orders.
Governor Gage is the abject tool of the
Mexican and will not hesitate to re- i
move any member of ihr board who
proves refractory. The scandal of such
an action is disagreeable, however, and
will be avoided if possible. But, how
ever, the trick is to be turned; Burns
demands the patronage. He has shown,
however, that in extrem* Instances h>
can be condescending Shortls after
the Board of Health was appointed Dr.
Keenej went to Burne and asked his
permissioi to appoint K. M. Jone
clerk to the Health ( >fflcer.
The position of clerk Â« > the Health Of
ficer is one that entails upon its pos
sessor no more serious duty than the
exertion of sufficient energy to keep
alive. K. M. Jones is a' brother-in-law
of Dr. K< â¢â¢ ney, and was recently dis
missed from the Health Department
for Intemperai cc. This fact may have
induced Burns to be lenient, and he per
mitted Dr. Keeney to appoint the new
( If rk. But with the permission came
a condition.- Burns handed Dr. Keeney
a list of names. "That i? the pio
gramme," said the Mexican. "Elect ;
those nipn at your first meeting."
Dr. Keeney took the list. The names
were: Leon Dennery. secretary; Dr. j
W. M. Lawior, Hoalth Officer; Peter I
Devany, assistant secretary- Two if
these men were elected to their respec
tive positions at the first mating of the
board. Dr. K (> eney is an expert on pills
and pallets, but the dose was hard to
take, lie knew, however, that it was
only the first of a sÂ«=rie<=.
trict ''curt yesterday to have Woolbr
declared an Insolvent. They alleged that
he committed an act of bankruptcy by
transferring his interest in .several gold
niir.es ard his real estate to J. K. Walsh
without a valid consideration.
Henry Jund, butcher, of Temescal, Aia
m.-da County, filed a petition in Insolv
ency, estimpiing his liabilities at $305S 2*.
His" available assets are about 1930.
SUPERVISORS MANDAMUSED.
Suit Filed to Compel the Auditing of j
Jurors' Demands.
A petition was filed yesterday by Attor- I
ney Louis P. Bondman for a writ of man- I
date to bo directed against the Board of j
Supervisors, compelling them to audit the j
demands of the various jurors who have j
been sitting- in the criminal departments j
of the Superior Court lor the past several j
months. Under a recent decision of the '
Supreme Court defining the status of civil ]
jurors and holding that they could not j
collect fees for sitting in civil cases the
Supervisors found excuse to refuse to i
audit the demands of the criminal jurors. j
In consequence they organized, employed i
Louis P. Boardman to represent them, j
and suit has now been filed.
Many of the jurors nave been in forced
attendance for many weeks and in con
sequence have been deprived of moneys
they could have made In their vocations. I
Heretofore they have been paid $2 a day, j
and the refusal of the Supervisors to j
allow their demands is working a great }
hardship. Hence the suit will be pushed |
to a final adjudication. j

feelingly saying: "Friends, neigh
bors and fellow citizens: First of all
Senator Perkins will speak .such words
as seem to him fitting- to the occa
sion, to the hour and to our senti
ments." Senator Perkins, who was a
dear friend of the deceased, then arose
and delivered a eulogy that brought
tears to the eyes of his listeners and
which Impressed every one with the
worth of the late Mr. Phelps. Fol
lowing isa transcript of his, remarks:
"Friend after friend departs,
Who has not â  lost., a -friend?
There Is no union here- of â  hearts
That finds not here an end."
It is as natural to die as It Is to lie born
and â¢to live. Death enters the palace as
well as the cottace. The Rreat ami ] the
learned, the philosopher and the peasant,
the rich and the poor all must obey, its
command. It comes into our social and
business life every day, and .some friend
or acquaintance, is called, to- that .bourne '
whence no traveler- returns. Yet 'we never
become reconciled to Its visit, and we can
not understand why this or that friend
should he taken and we left for a time
to struggle on.
We come to-day to pay the last. sad. trib
ute of respect to the Vnemory of one who
has contributed as much toward develop
ing: the resources and building; up of . our
commonwealth as any other pioneer of- our
State.
Timothy Guy Phelps was born in ; the
State of New York December 24, 1824. . He
received a good common school education,
and when 21 years of age went to New
York to engage In mercantile pursuits, and
Hales.
after .a few years' experience' returned to
Ills rural home to study law. A- few years
later, when the report of gold discovery
in California. â  reached New York, Mr.
Phelps abandoned his law studies and
started for California, arriving in San Fran
cisco December 14, 1849, alter a passage of
162 days from Panama, a length of time
almost equal to the time it would have
required to come by sailing vessel around
Cape Horn. He started immediately for
the mires and engaged in river mining in
Tuolnmne County. Failing, like thousands
of others, to realize his. dream of wealth
from the | new El Dorado, hi?, returned to
San Francisco and embarked in the mercan
tile business, being moderately .successful
until a disastrous fire swept over the city,
taking away the accumulative earnings of.
years of himself and ,â¢ business associates.
Hut with that force and â  energy which were
such strong traits of his character, he did
not become, discouraged,' but applied him
self â¢ with renewed energy to building, up
a new fortune. His public 'political career
began In 1854, when he ran as a candidate
for the Legislature In company with the
late Colonel E. D. Baker, who while a
Senator of I the . United States . from Oregon
cave his life in defense of our country. In
1858 Mr. Phelps was 'nominated and elected
Hales.
to . the . Legislature from Van Francisco and
Ban Mated County on the first Republican
ticket in this State. During the five years
that he was in the Legislature he was al
ways the stanch friend of the people and
of the public welfare. â  He strongly opposed
the bulkhead scheme, a scheme to give pos
session to private speculators of the San
Francisco water front for fifty years and
the right to levy tolls and wharfage upon
the shipping of the port.
In'lSCl Mr. Phelps was a prominent can
didate for Governor, but was defeated be
fore the convention by' Governor {Hartford.
He, however, was immediately nominated
for Congress and elected by a majority of
16.500.' which was the highest encomium to
his popularity- with the people. He at once
took- a prominent part in Congress, and
among other measures he voted,- for the
abolition of slavery In the District of Co
lumbia. He enjoyed in a - marked degree
the friendship and confidence â¢of President
Lincoln, who consulted him in all -matters
relating to the Pacific Coast. : . â -:

The Masonic choir, composed of
Samuel D. Mayer, J. R. Offilvie, J. R.
Jones and J. F. Fleming-, rendered
"Still, Still With Thee." At the con
clusion of the singing Dr. Stebbins led
in prayer. The aped and eloquent di
vine touched on the present and here
after, sympathizing with the family of
the deceased and paying his tribute in
words of beauty and significance.
After the singing of "Rest in Peace"
by the choir, the funeral cortege left
the house of sadness. Following the
