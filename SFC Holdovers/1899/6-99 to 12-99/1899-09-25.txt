TOO SHARP
BATTLES WITH
THE YAQUIS
Nineteen Mexican Soldiers
Are Killed and Several
Wounded.
FOUR OFFICERS FALL
â¦
Inhabitants of River Towns Who
Were Taken Prisoners by the
Indians Are Released.
â¦
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES. Sept. 24.â Official
reports of two battles between
Mexicans and Yaquis have just
been received here. General
Luis Torres had declared the j
campaign suspended until October,
but the Yaquis were not consult
ed on that point. Lorenzo Torres
j also appears to have made different j
I arrangements.
On September 14 Lorenzo Torres
j crossed the river to Vicam. a town sup
posed to have been captured by Luis |
Torres in August, and found the Indi- |
ans. They attacked his rear guard,
and a running fight ensued. The report
says the Indians were dispersed and
nine killed. The Mexican loss was five
killed and nine wounded, among the
latter Lieutenant Colonel Navarro of j
the Eleventh Battalion, one of the best !
officers on the Mexican side. v -
The report of a battle on the 18th
comes from another source, also offi
cial, and its statements of the number j
killed may be accepted. According to
this report the forces under Colonel
Hernandez (number not stated) en
countered 1000 Indians near Lake Za
quaca, a small lagoon between Torin
and Potam. The Indians retired from
the open field and sought cover In the
thick woods, where the combat raged
for more than two hours, beginning at
6 o'clock in the morning. The report
says the Indians were defeated and dis
persed, leaving on the field ST dead.
The Mexican losses are stated as four- j
teen soldiers- killed and thirty-six
wounded. Major Ruiz of the National
Guard was mortally wounded, and
Julian Esponza. captain of the Yaquis I
â who are friendly to the Mexicans, and j
Tetebins. a lieutenant in the ten years" j
war, were killed. An interesting feat
ure of the reports is the statement that
several inhabitants of river towns who
â were taken prisoner by the Yaquis in
July have been released and have re
turned to headquarters in Torin. Here
tofore the Mexicans have represented
the Yaquis as invariably torturing and
killing all prisoners.
BROUGHT A WRECKED
VESSEL INTO PORT
Engineer of the Boscowitz Saves Her
After She Was Given Up
as Lest.
VICTORIA, R. C. Sept. 24,â Much to
the surprise of shipping men the steamer
Barbara Boscowitz steamed into the
harbor this morning:. When thÂ« steamer
Princess J.oulse, which arrived on Friday,
left the Skeena, the Boscowitz was lying
almost submerged; with the water rac
ing through her hold, stranded on an old
Ice break, r. Her boiler and engines had
phlfted and some of her steam pipes were
broken.
She was patched with canvas and
cement and the water pumped from her.
Then her engineers set out to fix the
Jumbiod up engines and broken pipes.
How they accomplished this is a surprise
to all engineers who lihvp viewed the
pitched up engines, Kngineer McGregor
with characteristic modesty will not talk
of his feat. "I had been reading about
how those fellows fixed up their engines
In Kipling's story 'Between the Devil and
the Deep Sea,' and I thought to myself
that if engines could be fixed under such
circumstances, surely we could get ours
straightened up enough to bring her
down."
This is the second time within a year
that the Boscowitz has been given up as
lest and she ha been saved.

The chief cities of Ihe vilayet or province of Adam are Smyrna, its

hills only to be again and again

hills ant! looking seaward they were |
transfixed with horror as they saw a |

its force, and around it the sea swirled j
like a pieat maelstrom.
This saved the village from destruction. |
The tide would rise ten feet in the space 1
irf four or five minutes, and in an equally [
short time go down again. These sudden j
fluctuations being frequently repeated, i
tents were pitched on the hills back of the j
village and nearly the whole population !b
camping out, fearing that another tidal
tion in Trafalgar square this afternoon
resulted in a drastic failure. Thou
sands assembled, but not to support
the speakers. On the contrary, the
crowd waved Union Jacks and sang the
national anthem and "Rule, Britan
nia," like mighty invocations.
The speakers, who were quite in
audible, were received with groans, de
cayed apples and eggs and other mis
siles. There \\pre cheers for Mr. Cham
berlain. Secretary of State for the Col
onies, and hissos for President Kruger.
There were several ugly rushes for
the platforms, which were surrounded
:by opponents of the demonstration,
who yelled fiercely. Finally the mount
ed police were telephoned for to clear
the square. Batons were freely used;
several persons were trodden upon by
the horses, and thirty arrests were
made.

present there have been frequent shocks,
one having occurred this forenoon.
Near Hubbard Glacier, on Disenchant

and a mile from them, at an elevation of !
sixty-four feet above the sea Messrs. j
T. Smith, Cox and son, J. Falls and D. i

day the 10th. was experienced, the Fleuer
party had rigged a machine, and were
taking the oscillations of .he earthquake
waves, when, without a moment's warn

the tent. At the same moment a large

no opportunity to address the crowd.
They were saluted with execrations as
soon as they mounted the platforms,
and were obliged to stand, smiling
complacently, during the singing of
the national airs and the wild cheering
for Mr. Chamberlain. Their attempts
to put their resolutions to a vote were
the merest dumb show.
Henry M. Hundman, the socialist
leader, was a particular object of ani
mosity. He was menaced with a for
est of walking-sticks when he tried to
speak.
The shouldering of a soldier and a
marine, their hands clasped, in a pro
cession around the square, provoked
frantic enthusiasm, and was alto
gether an impressive Incident, the
multitudes bursting into the song
"Soldiers of the Queen."
On many of the passing omnibuses,
which carry small Union Jacks, the
passengers lifted the flags from their
sockets and waved them vigorously.
The opponents of the meeting finally
proposed resolutions in support of the
Government's policy, wnlch were car

Examiners. He declares that the mention
of his name is unwarranted.
"If Knowlton made that statement," re

whose utterances I would believe any

"I have never had any financial trans
action with Dr. Tebbets for $65 or any
other sum. I have been practicing "for
over twelve years, and have been licensed
all that time, and certainly I. have not
had any need to do business with the
State Board recently.
"I am surprised that Dr. Ci-anz should
suddenly become so prominent. Twelve
years ago we practiced dentistry together,
and he was licensed about three months
ago. He is a funny fellow with a most
remarkable history. If he is In any
sense responsible for connecting my name

Commandant Steele Sends
Out a Relief Expe

MANY Volunteers

. Special Dispatch to The. Call.
VICTORIA, B. C. Sept. 24.âAccord
ing to news received from Dawson by
the steamer Cottage City,, which'ar
rived to-day, a relief expedition has
been dispatched by Commandant
Steele of the Northwest Mounted Po
lice to relieve the sufferings and pri
vation being experienced on the Mac
kenzie River.
For some time past reports, the hor
rors of which equalled the awful
stories which came from the Edmonton i
trail, had reached Dawson, and early:
in September an Austrian, C. Edward
son, staggered into Dawson, and his j
sufferings, together with the bunches
of appeals received by the police from :
the outside asking for news of relatives
lost in that district, touched the sym
pathies of Colonel Steele, and he called
for volunteers to take the hazardous
journey and relieve those in need and
make inquiries for the missing ones.
A : number offered to go, and, com
manded by Corporal Sklrving, they left
Dawson on September 2. They will go
by canoe to the mouth of the Porcu
pine River, 100 miles below Dawson. i
and up that stream to the portage, to
Bell and West Rat River, thence across
the mountains to the Peel, and from
' there portage to the Mackenzie, and up
that stream to Fort McPherson.
The Dawson Nugget says the men
j are provisioned for six weeks, after
â¢ which they will- have to pick up their
provender, and it is likely they will be
out several months, if not until next
j summer, as the journey is a long and
I dangerous one.
1 Edwardson, the' last of the unfor
tunates to reach Dawson from the
McKenzie, lost his outfit by* the!
swamping of his boat, and for a week
was without food. He subsisted on
roots and bark of trees until found ly
ing helplessly' sick with fever and in
delirium by some miners. After nurs
ing him back to health they gave him
food, and he continued his journey out.
The fcod gave out, though, before he
reached Dawson, and whin at. length
he reached there he was suffering from i
the pangs of hunger.
Captains Anderson and Robertson
returned to Dawson on September 2 1
after a ten weeks' prospecting tour. in j
the Upper Klondike, Porcupine and j
Stewart River countries. Their route j
lay up the South Fork twenty miles; j
across to the North Fork, and up that i
! stream to its head; then over the di
vide to Porcupine. After prospecting, |
they turned south, passing around the
headwaters of the Klondike and touch
! ing at McQuesten River, in the Stew
1 art country; thence back to the south I
fork of the Klondike and home. They
prospected on many creeks, but only
colors were found. Owing to the fact
that rimrock . was exposed on the
creeks, prospecting was easy. They are
satisfied there is no . gold between
Hunker and the Porcupine and the |
Rockies. Some rich quartz specimens
were brought, from the Stewart River
section.' 1 ' * â¢ â  ;. J .V''

CUBAN NATIONALISTS
WILL BACK UP GOMEZ
HAVANA, Sep. 24.â Cubans who are well {
informed as to local politics in connec- I
tion with the coming election say that. I
though the Cuban League and thb Cuban j
National party are/ nominally united;
many members of the National. party are j
really determined/to push General Max
imo Gomez to the front as soon as an op
portune moment arrives. .
The Patria in an editorial urges the
amalgamation of these two organizations
and says:
"It is very important that the coming
flections should be guided and. inspired
by one united party, because upon the |
tone of the elections virtually depends j
the. decision with regard to Cuban inde- j
pendence.' * â¢; '*'â '. ' â â â â 'â  â â â â ">; i
It also asserts that Guarberto Gomez
will hold off until all thought of Maximo
Gomez as a common leader is absolutely
repudiated. He is without doubt a thorn
in the side of all factions, as he has a
powerful negro backing.
THE INJURED IN THE
TRAIN WRECK BETTER
PUEBLO, Colo., Sept. 24.â A1l the in
jured in the wreck of Saturday afternoon
on the Rio Grande Railroad near Canyon
City are doing well at the hospitals here.
Mrs. F. A. Wills of Los Angeles, both
of whose legs were broken, and C. R.
Cook of Millers, Tnd., whose shoulder was
brokenâ these two being the wost seri
ously injuredâ are getting along quite
well, though neither is out of danpr-r.
The passengers who were slightly hurt
will be able to continue their journey in
a few days. The bodies of all the dead
were brought here. Some have been
shipped on instructions from relatives,
while others are awaiting disposition.
Such investigation of the wreck as has
been made thus far places the blame on
the crew of the freight train. The Coro
ner's jury will nut make its findings
known until to-morrow.

" The area covered by the ruins

A NATIONAL
CIVIC SOCIETY
â  â : Â«
The Plan of the Chicago
Federation.
Â«
Special Dispatch. to "flip Call.
CHICAGO. Sept. 24.â executive com
mittee of the Civic Federation of Chicago
has authorized its president. Franklin H.
Head, to appoint a committee of twenty
five to organize a National Civic Federa
tion. The committee is to be composed of
men representing different sections of the
country and. different phases of social and
economical questions of the day. The
object of such an organization is stated
to be to provide for a thorough discussion
and consideration of questions of national
importance, affecting either the foreign
or domestic policy of the United States;
to aid in .the crystallization of themost en
lightened' public sentiment in tne country
In * respect/ thereto, and to pro
mote necessary legislation in ac
cordance therewith. The leaders of
the civic federation : have contem
plated this move for some time, deem
ing it essential if a national work were
to become anything more than educa
tional. . â¢ ; .-. *
In January; 1898, the Chicago Civic
Federation called a national conference
on primary elections ana municipal re
forms, which was held in New York, and
was attended by representatizes of forty
of the largest cities of the United States.
The Impetus given to primary election
reform resulted in both New York and
Illinois securing laws at the following
sessions of their respective legislatures.
But beyond- this and the- publication and
distribution of proceedings, the Chicago
Federation has found it impracticable to
go. In August. 189S, it called at Saratoga
a national conference on the foreign pol
icy of the United States, which, after two
days of animated debate by the leading
men of all parties, unanimously agreed
upon some broad general principles which
called for further effort to render it of
permanent value to the country. This
work could not be followed by the Chi
cago organization. *
The four days' trust conference recently
held in Chicago was not expected to agree
upon general principles, but it was be
lieved the free discussion by representa
tives Of so many schools of thought would
furnish material and a basis for more
thorough work hereafter. It is to make
it possible to follow up the practical lines
suggested by the conference that the na
tional civic federation is projected. .
DR. JORDAN SAYS THE
WAR IS UNJUSTIFIABLE
A Strong Nation Has No Bight to
Take the Lands of a Weaker
One.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Sept. 24.â
Dr. David Starr Jordan occupied the pul
pit of the University chapel this morning
and delivered a vigorous address, in which
he touched upon the subject of imperial
ism In his usual terse way. Taking as his
text, "It needs be that offenses must
come, but woe to him that doth offend," !
he said:
Inevitableness does" not justify anything. j
What some people have termed an "irresisti- '
ble tendency" in nations or affairs fades when
a man stands before It. The hero is the j
man who takes the inevltableness in hand and
makes the necessary sacrifice. There [a a will
ingness upon the part b{ many to excuse an
hereditary vice, saying: "My rather was a
drunkard: how can I keep sober?" You must
remember that it was not your father's whisky,
but his weakness that you Inherited. Nature
never accepts any excuses, the effect being the
fame as If done with Intention.
Given a fool with money and the world as
we know it. and. it Is a sure prediction that
the fool and his money will soon bo parted.
This, however, does not Justify the business
of the gambler or the swindler.
I know a great nation that said to a little
nation: "Give up your weapons, gold and lands
to me or they will get you Into trouble." Some
argue that there are feeble nations on the
earth that are going to be exploited, so why
should not we exploit them" i believe that
there should be ethics among nations as well
as among men. John Brown truly said from
the scaffold that God Is no respecter of per
sons. He does not care whether a nation be
strong and wealthy with a boasted religion
if it does not obey His laWw. â¢
Through all the ages the slave has had his
revenge on hi:- master In that the effect of his
servitude always worked demoralization upon
the oppressor. Men who Justify existing
things by such phrases as "manifest destiny"
or "irresistible tendency' are generally either
too lazy to look into affairs or too slothful
to care. Such men ore the first to cry. "My
country right or wrong." Nothing can en
dure by which one set of men exist at the
expense of another.
It is the "manifest destiny" of the British
Empire to possess the land and vineyards of
the Dutch farmers in the Transvaal. "Just
bo sure as the British flag Is carried over the
Rand, Just so sure will It prove the disinteg
ration of the empire," wrote Â» celebrated Eng
lish scholar to me. Another Englishmanâ
time a soldierâ says: "Courage like CChambe r
lain's Is cheap enough. The tighter affairs
become, the tighter will he screw his monocle,
and If the people become tired of him he will
retire to his orchards, while I lie a victim of
dumdum bullets."
There Is no excUÃe for assisting the laws of
evolution by crushing the weak, nor putting
a banana . peel under the heel of the lame. -
The basis: of society is Justice and sympathy.
The lion and eagle typify things , In national
life â  that must pass away. Because : the An
glo-Saxon race has produced good men have
I confidence In it, and not because it is great
and strong.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK. Sept. 24. â Dr. Benja
min Ide Wheeler, the new president of
the University of' California, is at the
Hoffman House with Mrs. Wheeler and
their little son. He starts to-morrow
for San Francisco to begin the fall
work. The university will have as a
hew feature within the next year a
college of commerce, in which, Profes
sor Wheeler says, the students will be
educated so they may be prepared to
enter the Consular service of the
! United States. He told a reporter last
; night there was no doubt about the
\ rapid development of the Pacific Coast,
| and hereafter the United States would
| be one of the greatest exporting na
i tions, inquiring young men of special
; training to ' compete successfully in
China with the German and English
university men.
In speaking of the aims of the uni
versity, which, as is well known, Mrs.
I Hearst is greatly interested in. Dr.
j Wheeler said:
"Sometimes I am asked the question
if we are not overdoing university
work, with Stanford and. the State
University so close together. Certainly
I not. The 'State University has 2500
I students, and they are coming so fast
we don't know what to do with them.
During the last year it was necessary
to place some of them in tents. Four
temporary buildings are being used for
their accommodation.
"The freshman class this year num
bers 620 already, a gain of more than
ils per cent over last year. This does
| not include the professional schools
! and graduate departments. The ' mi
i crease in the attendance is so rapid it
is becoming a serious problem what we
; are to do with them, as no tuition is
j charged, 'f*he whole Pacific Coast is
j waiting for the State University to
take care of its boys. People here in
the East do not appear to appreciate
' how rapid â¢ the development is out
there. Owing to recent natural devel
opments San Francisco has really be
i come the 'front yard' of the nation in
| stead of the 'back yard.' San Fran
cisco is about the center of our posses
sions. The work of the two universi
j ties does not conflict. Stanford is a
private institution and possesses cer
tain advantages by reason of its being
such., It can do as it likes. The two
institutions work together and are a
great assistance to each other. ' Each
has its own field, and while there is a
healthy rivalry there is no conflict of
interests. Every advance one makes
will be of advantage to the other. Ex
perience has proved that already."
RECEPTION AT BERKELEY.
Plans of Studems to Greet the
New President.
BERKELEY. Sept. 24.â Before the com
ing week is over the new head nf the fac
ulty of the University of California will
have arrived in the university town. Pres
ident-elect Benjamin Ide- Wheeler has sent
word to the recorder of the faculties at
Berkeley that he would leave the East on
the 23d of this month and arrive in San
Francisco on Saturday, the 30th. Accord
ing to this President Wheeler is now on
his way to the Pacific Coast, and will
reach here in time to take up his work
Monday morning. Octoher 2.
Upon his- arrival President Wheeler will
be made the puest of honor at numberless
public receptions. Three distinctively uni
versity affairs have been arranged for
him. They will be giVfen at different times
by the members of the faculty, the Asso
ciated Alumni and the student body.
Elaborate preparations are being made
i for each affair. As yet the dates for the
three have not been set. They will be
fixed to suit the new president's conve
, nience.
The students' welcome will be very Jn
i formal. When President Wheeler, accom
-1 panted by his wife, reaches Berkeley sta
tion next Saturday a crowd of the col
lege men will be on hand, but no demon
stration of any kind is being planned.
! Carriages will be in waiting, and Presi
: dent and Mrs. Wheeler are to be driven to
their home on Biishnelt place. They are
to occupy the house left vacant by ex-
President Kellogg. On the Monday fol
| lowing President Wheeler will deliver a
! brief address to the student body from
the flagstafl in front of the library build
ing upon the campus. As soon as possible
after thai a public reception will be ten
dered him. either in the Harmon gymna
sium or in the Mark Hopkins Institute of
Art, San Francisco.
On that occasion it is expected that
President Wheeler will outline his policy
with regard to the university.

will result great good to the peoples of the three Americas. There is
nothing in the character of President McKinley to justify the attacks
made upon him by pretended friends of Latin America."

MANILA, Sept. 24. 11:25 a. m.â
The United States cruiser
Ch.-trieston, the monitor Mon
terey and the gunboats Con
cord and Zaflro, with marines
and bluejackets from the cruiser Balti
more, left Cavite September 19 and, as
already cabled, proceeded to Subig Ray
to destroy an insurgent cannon there.
< 'wing to the bad weather the operation
was postponed until yesterday, when
the warships for three hours bombard
ed the town of Olangapo and the in
tr^nchmetits where the gun was situ
ated.
Men froi'n the Charleston, Concord
and Zaflro were then landed under a
heavy insurgent fire, proceeding to the
cannon, which was utterly destroyed
by gun cotton, and then returned to
the warships. The Americans had one
man wounded during the engagement.
While waiting in Suhisj Bay for better
weather the Americans descried Fili
pino reinforcements moving toward
olangapo. At 6:40 a. m. yesterday the
Monterey began to advance upon the
town, which was about three miles
east of the monitor's anchorage. The
Charleston, Concord and Zafiro fol
lowed.
At 7:25 the Monterey opened fire with
her secondary and main batteries, the
Charleston and Concord joining imme
diately. At 7:30 the Insurgents' cannon
answered, the first shot passing close
to the Monterey's smokestack. The
gun was fired twice only.
The American bombarding then be
came general. At 9:30 the Monterey
advanced to a range of 600 yards, us
ing her main battery. At 11 o'clock
250 men were landed about 800 yards
east of the cannon under a severe Mau
ser fire. The men from the Charleston
were the first to reach the beach, but
the Concord's men were the first at the
gun, which they reached at 11:10. The
cannon was found to be a sixteen-cen
timeter Krupp gun, presumably ob
tained from thf> Spaniards.
Meanwhile the warships continued to
shell the shelving beach on the east
and west side to silence the insurgent
fire upon the sailors from the trenches
skirting the beach.
Gunner Olson exploded fifty rounds
of gun cotton In three discharges in the
cannon, which ha<] .suffered from the
fire from the warships.
The Americans then returned to the
boats, the firing inland being kept up
to pr< tect the embarkation. The Con
cord's men were the last to reach the
chore, and the warships were reached
at 11:50.

day: "I wish through the press
of San Francisco to convey to
the people of that city my
thanks for the manner in which
the Wyoming volunteers and
Wyoming visitors to the city
have been treated. Every at
tention and courtesy possible to
think of has been extended to
our troops and their friends
who have visited them from
this State by the municipal of
ficers, the various soldiers' aid
societies, by General Shatter
and by the people of San Fran
cisco generally. We are greatly
indebted to San Francisco, and
hope to have a chance to repay
her in a fitting manner."
Elaborate preparations have
been made to give the Wyoming
Volunteers an ovation from the
lime they enter Wyoming until
they reach their homes.

WASHINGTON, Sept. 24. â Acting
Secretary Allen of the Navy Depart
ment received a cablegram from Rear
Admiral Watson to-day giving a brief
account of the engagement at Sublg
Hay. It is dated the 24th, at Manila,
and says:
Mandora discovered heavy gun mounted
opposite Kalaklan Point. Subig Bay; ex
changed shots with Charleston. Sent
Charleston, Monterey, Concord and Zaflro
with detachment of marines and sailors
from Baltimore to capture and destroy.
Attacked insurgent position 23d; after bom
bardment landing party carried lntreiich
ments, dispossessed enemy and destroyed
one sixteen centimeter Krupp gun. Cas
ualties: William Shepherd, apprentice sec
ond class, Charleston. Bertously wounded;
Charles Haffke, coal passer. Concord,
heat prostration. Insurgent fire heavy
but poorly aimed; enemy loss unknown.
A report mailed.
The Important feature of the engage
ment is the fact which is disclosed that
the insurgents have been able to obtain
a Krupp gun. It was known at the
time of the outbreak of the insurgents
against the Americans that the artil
lery of the insurgents Consisted of a
few obsolete guns captured from the
Spaniards.
Acting Secretary Allen says it is evi
dent that the navy at Manila does not
intend to allow any fort to be erected
by the insurgents which can be reached
by the ships, and he is convinced that
the squadron under Rear Admiral Wat-
Bon will be able to keep the shores
guarded and repeat the lesson of yes
terday if the insurgents are found to
be operating on the coast.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK. Sept. 24.â A1l the gen-
I eral arrangements for the reception of
I Admiral Dewey are now completed,
i and only a few minor details are left
Ito be settled. The majority of these
| cannot be attended to until the ad
j miral has arrived and his wishes have
I been consulted.
All the sub-committees have about
finished their work and have presented
their reports to the general committee.
The committee on distribution of tick
ets was at work in the Mayor's office all
day and until late, into the night. They
! apportioned nearly 20,000 tickets, all
i there were at their disposal. There
were applications for more than 100,000.
Their work did not include the distribu
tion of tickets to the Municipal j As
sembly and the school children's
stands. These tickets will be at the
j disposal of the municipal legislators
and the president of the board of edu
cation.
The committee on stands will hold
i its final meeting to-morrow and decide
! exactly what will be the capacity of
the new stands. If the committee
' stands for all the expenditures it has
i authorized it will have spent more than
i $45,000 in excess of the first appropria
j tion made to it of $30,000, and $4000
; more than it has in sight even if the
j Municipal Assembly votes to give it
the additional $25,000 that is to be asked j
for at Tuesday's meeting of the Alder
men and Council.
For the seventy-odd thousand ex
pended the committee has furnished
about 20,000 seats to the ticket commit-
I teeâ 4ooo of the City Hall stands, 6000
i for the school children, 10,000 for the
I municipal Assembly â 25,000 for the
j veterans of the Grand Army of the Re-
I publicâ a total of about 45,000 seats, for
I about $74,000.
Work on the big Dewey triumphal
arch is rapidly being pushed, and the
arch will be in proper condition Â» in
plenty of time. To-day while some
, workmen were raising the figure of a
i sailor to the top of a pedestal a Broad
way car ran against one of the guy
ropes of the derrick, and derrick, statue
and workmen fell over on top of the
car. There was a slight panic among
the thousands of people watching the
structure from the sidewalks, but the
police finally restored order. No one
j was hurt, and the figure of the sailor
was but slightly damaged.
Governor Deforest Richards of Wy
-1 oming has telegraphed asking leave to
withdraw his previous refusal to par
ticipate in the celebration. The reply
was sent that New York would be
â  pleased to welcome him. -
Concerning the committee of seven
, that is to attend Admiral Dewey during
his stay in this city Mr. Foster said he'
'â  had received a reply in writing from
: Chauncey M. Depew and In person from
Richard Croker and William McAdoo.
Mr. Croker said the committee could
make any use of him they desired, and
that he was ready to do anything in
his power to help along the success of
the celebration. With the exception
of Levi P. Morton and W. C. Whitney,
all the members of the committee have
accepted. Neither of the last two has
been heard from.
HIGHLANDERS WILL NOT
BE IN THE PROCESSION
TORONTO, Ont., Sept. 24.â A special
from Ottawa to the Mail and Kmpire
says:
The Forty-eighth Highlanders of
Toronto will not be granted permission to
visit New York to take part in the recep
tion to Admiral Dewey. The Militia De
partment has not received the communi
cation from the district commanding of
ficer at Toronto embodying the request of
Lieutenant Colonel Crosby and his of
ficers for permission to make the trip,
but when it comes, an answer in the
negative will be returned.
The view held here is that Admiral
Dewey is to be the central figure in the
New York celebration, yet, after all, the
demonstration really will be a glorifica
tion of the United States victories in the
Spanish war. Under the circumstances,
therefore, it is considered very impolitic
for a British regiment to participate. The
pipe band of the Royal Scots of Montreal
has also been refused permission to take
part in the proposed demonstration.
NATIVES SCUTTLE
GUNBOAT URDANETA
MANILA. Sept. 25.â The gunboat Urda
neta. belonging to the mosquito fleet
which has been patrolling the shore on
the north of Manila Bay, has not been
heard from for ten days. Her coal supply
must by this time necessarily be exhaust
ed, and search for her was made. Natives
who were interrogated by lieutenant
Franklin, in command of the gunboat La
guna rie Bai, told that officer the Urda
neta bombarded the town of Orani yes
terday. The crew landed to take posses
sion, whereupon they were seized by a
large body of natives, who had set a trap
for them. The prisoners were removed to
Porac and the gunboat looted and scut
tled. The gunboats Petrel, Callao and
Basco are now searching for the sunken
vessel.

MISS GRANT WEDDED TO PRINCE
CANTACUZENE IN ACCORDANCE

summer residence of Mr. and Mrs. Pot- I
ter Palmer.
The American statutes are yet to be j
conformed to before the distinguished I

husband and wife, and it is that cere
mony in All Saints' Episcopal Church
to-morrow noon to which the summer
colony here, as well as numerous j
friends, diplomatic, military and civil, :
are looking forward with eager expect
ancy.
A special altar had been raised in the

assistant. After the room had been |
formally consecrated, at 8:30 o'clock j
the bride appeared at the head of the I
grand staircase, leaning on the arm of j
her brother, I'lysses S. Grant. At the
altar, before which stood the Russian
priest, waited Prince Cantacuzene, clad
in the full uniform of the Chevalier
Guard. The bride's dress was severely
cut and was a simple gown of the rich
est white satin, with sweeping train
and veil of tulle. She carried a bou
quet of stephanotis and lilies of the j
valley and wore the gifts of the groom, i
a corsage ornament of diamonds and j
enamel, and a rope of pearls.

CAT.I. HEADQUARTERS. WELLING
TON-HOTEL. WASHINGTON, Sept 24.â
Vice President Hobarfs poor health, it Is
now generally believed, will make it im
possible for him to accept the renomlna
tion next year. < â¢:â â 
The President and Republican leaders
generally favor his nomination for the
second place on the ticket if he believes
he is well enough to accept a second time.
Recent reports, however, give little
ground for^ the hope that he will be able
to do so. In that event it is believed the
nomination will go to New York. In view,
of Governor Roosevelt's determination
not to accept it, Secretary of War Root
will probably be named.
The success in the Philippines, which is
expected this winter, will bring Secretary !
Root's administration of the War Depart- j
ment into notice and will make him a '
strong candidate. If the campaign should !
be such, however, as not to reflect credit
on the War Department, some one else
will htÂ»Ve to be obtained.
President McKinley may go into the
campaign for re-election not only with a
new candidate on the ticket with him
but with a new manager of the campaign.
It is well known that Senator Hanna is
not in good health. It is said by one of
his close political friends In Ohio that he
docs not intend to undertake the manage
men:, of another Presidential campaign.
He will not resign from the chairman
ship of the committee. He will continue
i.n that office until the convention next
year. The committee will then be re
organised, as it is every four years, and
Senator Hanna will ask that some one
else be put in charge of the campaign a3
chairman. It is too early now to predict
who will be selected, as the choice will be
made by the new committee, which will
be elected by the convention.

BANK ROBBER AND
MURDERER IS PARDONED
Daniel F. Dougherty, Who Killed Hia
Accomplice in a Quarrel Over
the Spoils, Free.
NEW YORK. Sept. 24.â A cable,n-am re
ceived in tliis city from Manchester, Eng
land, announces the release from prison
there on Friday of Daniel F. Dougherty,
alias Big Doc, the notorious American
bank robber and murderer. The ex-con
vict is now probably on his way to the
Tutted States.
In a quarrel, most likely over the di
vision of plunder, in England, on Decem
ber 1, 1887, Dougherty killed an American
confederate named Graham. He was con
victed of murder and sentenced to life
Imprisonment at Manchester. His pardon
was secured on account of the prisoner's
ill health. Dougherty was arrested In 1868
for bank robbery and was sentenced to
fifteen years' Imprisonment at Charles
town. Mass. Tie served his full term and
was released in 1883.
BIG LEAK IN THE
COLORADO RIVER DAM
City of Austin Left Without Elec
tric Lights or Streetcar
Service.
AT'STTX. Sept. 24.â The great flam
across the Colorado River here, which
was constructed by the city a few years
ago at a cost of an even million dol
lars, has sprung a big leak, and the
waters in the hike formed by the dam are
gradually receding.
This leak, together with the prolonged
drought, has caused the municipal elec
tric light and power plant to shut down,
and the city is without lights and electric
Btreetcar service, and will probably con
tinue in that condition for an Indefinite
period. An effort is being made to repair
the leak.

Colonel and Mrs. Hem and Bishop Pot
ter.
The picturesque ritual, interspersed
with frequent music by a local quar
tet, was lengthy. The services closed
with the singing: of the Russian na
tional hymn, after which the couple
received congratulations while the or
chestra discoursed music. The cere
mony consumed one hour, and it was
nearly midnight when the guests de
parted.
The betrothal began with the Great
Ectenia, followed by prayers and spe
cial petitions for the salvation of the
betrothed couple, for the blessing of
their offspring and peaceful mutual af
fection. The priest then took the rings
he had received from the bride and
groom. With the gold one, represent
ing the domination of the groom,
three crosses above the groom's head
were made, and then it was Slipped
upon the fourth finger of the groom's
hand. Similar details were gone
through with the sliver ring and the
bride. After this Honire Palmer,
proxy for Grand Duke Cyril of Russia,
acting as best man, or sponsor, for
th.- Prince, stepped forward and trans
posed the rings three times, finally
leaving the gold ring on the bride's
finger and the silver one on the
groom's, these rings being given in
token of the lifelong union into which
they were r-iHcring.
The exchange by the sponsor in
dicated the consent of the family. The
rite closed by the prayer that the
Lord may establish these espousals in
the faith, in harmony, truth and love,
and may bless from heaven the putting
on of rings.
Next came the rite of a marriage.
The couple approached toward the
lecturn, still holding the lighted can
dles. As they proceeded thÂ« quartet
sang Psalm XVI. Halting upon a rug,
the priest inquired of them if they had
spontaheons wishes and firm intention
to contract the conjugal union with
each other, and whether they had
promised to contract the union with
any one else. These questions properly
answered, the priest asked a blessing
upon the couple. The priest then
crowned the Prince and then the
Princess.
A cup of wine was brought and
blessed. The couple drank from it
alternately three times each. The
priest then took them by the hands
and led them three times around the
lecturn, the best man and attendants
following, holding the crowns above
the heads of the newly wedded pair.

ANGELS CAMP, Sept. 24.â Joe Pete,
the Washoe Indian who shot and killed
Willie Danberg at Gardnerville, Nev.,
on the Bth inst., will probably be cap
tured within a few days. After com
mitting the atrocious deed he made his
escape to the vicinity of Gardners,
where he had relatives. Since that time
he has been seen, and has probably
been kept supplied with provisions by
his own people. Had it not been that a
party from Nevada came over to Gard
ners and heralded their mission in the
camp of the Indian's relatives he would
have probably now been in the hands
of the law.
Last Thursday a Mrs. Sapp was driv
ing cattle, when an Indian was seen to
cross the road and disappear in the
brush, but not until she had recognized
him as Pete. He was also seen at a
cattle camp later. He is now definitely
located, and lives within a radius of
seven miles. When the officers first
made their appearance among the
Washoes at Gardners two sisters of
Joe Pete commenced to cry and lament
the fact that the outlaw would be
taken
The officers from this place have now
! determined upon a plan by which the
murderer can be taken at the proper
time. The members of the tribe who
have spent the summer around Gard
ners are now being taken to the upper
| mountains, where they came from, and
' where Pete cannot go without being
taken. This will leave him to shift
for himself, and as soon as the cold
weather comes will drive him to some
camp for provisions. He is completely
â  surrounded, and cannot get out of the
j country. ____________

CALIFORNIA WELCOMES
THE MINERS` GUESTS
VISIT OF AMERICAN INSTITUTE
OF MINING ENGINEERS OF GREAT
IMPORTANCE TO CALIFORNIA
THE California meeting of the American Institute of Mining Engin
eers which will begin in San Francisco to-day, lasting three days, and
attended and followed by much hospitality throughout the State,
will bo composed of an uncertain percentage of about 3000 of the
most eminent and progressive leaders of the mining industry, which
cuts po great and so growing a figure in California's prosperity and indus
trial future. The institute is the largest technical society in the United
States, and it has from Its organization twenty-eight years ago been the
most progressive and successful one. On the special train which brings a
compact lOastern party to the city to-day are 1 ut comparatively few of the
members, but forty or so thus coming together will be supplemented by a
large number of members who will gather individually from all over the
Pacific Coast and elsewhere. The significance of the meeting to California
Is not to be measured by the number of members in attendance. It is not
* popular gathering, but those who come are leaders of a great industry,
with quick perceptions and a wish to know of California's mineral resources
and its human good fellowship, as well of the famed delights which nature
has given it. This is an extremely busy day in the mining and metallurgical
world and many who would have come in a less exacting time have ex
pressed keen regrets at not being able to .attend the most interesting of
seventy-three meetings of the institute.
It is worth more to the State that one man of this stamp who leads
mining capital and the expansion of the industry should learn of Califor
nia's possibilities than that fifty members of a popular society should
hear of what is underground in "California's veined hills and mountains.
The greatest benefit may be a reflex one, resulting from a season uf stimu
lated interest in California's mines and untold mineral resources, from an
awakening to an effort to declare the vast mineral possibilities of the State
and from the hearty extension of hospitality to worthy guests which blesses
him who gives. The irstitute has been a powerful influence in mining prog
resa to which California was much, and the entire State will join the miners
organized in the California Miners' Association in extending a cordial wel
come and California treatment to those who are about to travel hundreds
of miles among our chief mineral regions. For three days beginning to
day the sessions of the meeting will help enliven the Palace Hotel, and
then for nearly three weeks a party of 150 or more will travel about the'
State to see places of the State's resources that have not before attracted
parties of distinguished visitors.

first formalities of the California hospi
talities which the guests have just begun
to enjoy and "m- of the most delightful
affairs that the visitors will have tn re
member. The rough boaVd walls were en
tirÂ» ly hidden by tastefully arranged ever
greens and bunting and shields and large
American and English flaps were dis
played together in token of the joint na
tionality of the Mountain Copper Mining
Company's interests. A most striking
ft-ature was provided by arrangements of
pans, picks, shovels, axes and ropes with
the date 1849, while in the floor front a
great compressed air drill reared itself
with the date of 1899, giving a forcible
suggestion to the visitors of California
mining progress.
Nearly everybody was pleasantly sur
:>risÂ»-d at linding so dainty a spread with
such artistic settings in such a wild re
cess of a mining region. When the
speechmaking time arrived Manager E.
T. Wright, late of London, and a mem
ber of the Institute, offered a aeat wel
come in which England figured, and
President Douglas and Secretary Kay- '
mond responded. It was a wentle Sab
bath afternoon away up in the tangled :
hills with the scene of ceaseless labor far
underground and this influence and pos- |
sibly the declination of three members of
the Eastern party to take a Sunday ex- :
cursion prompted Raymond to a dedara
tion that the Father of All would have
smiled on the Isolated scene of labor and
fraternity and then he suggested the .
singing of the hymn "America." Nobody :
i thai an Englishman started it,
but the 2<>i rose and th>- hymn welled
forth. Then, as if spontaneously, all ,
sang "God Save the Queen" and all were
touched at the beauty and significance
of the incident. In his remarks Presi
dent Douglas observed that grasping
John Bull should not be begrudged that
little slice of America that he was de
veloping so splendidly or the remarkable
little railroad he had built, since no
Americans would do it before. Manager
Wright said that they who were shut up
there in the mountains were not there
for their health, but to satisfy the needs
of a greedy and querulous world.
Such and other incidents and senti
ments attended the first day of the insti
tute in California. Such things will com
pose the importance and significance of
th.- California meeting of the Institute.
Their effect will not lie confined to the
people present at the moment, and they
may be provided by the most remote min
ing camps in the State, in which will j
often be found amid the rough life of the !
industry intelligence and culture that has ,
drawn on the whole world. The entire '
operative and clerical start of the com
pany at Keswlck ami the mine joined in j
the social ministrations, and everything i
but the mine Itself was thrown wide open. |

STORY OF HOW
SAN FRANCISCO
WAS SELECTED
Secretary of State Association
Tells of Efforts Resulting in
Institute's Coming.
E. 11. Benjamin, the indefatigable secre
tary of the California Miners' Asspcla
tion, was the Hist to start the bucci ssful
effort which resulted in the coming to
San Francisco of the American Institute
of Mining Engineers for it* fall meeting
uf 1899. He tells the story as follows:
"During December last 1 was address
ing the California Miners' Association
with R. Gilman J'.rown, manager of the
Standard Consolidated mine of Bodie,
| mainly with reference to the poesibilHi.-s
of organizing a Mono County association.
' Be suggested that it might be a good plan
j to make the association more technical in
its scope, ami in that connection suggest
ed that it would be a splendid idea if the
American Institute of Mining Engineers
could be brought out here. 1 said at
once that I would take It up if It met with
the approval of the association, and on
my return to the city I broached the mat
ter to President Neflf. Vice. President Ral
ston and others of The executive commit
tee. All agreed that it was a splendid
Idea, ami the early result was the official
invitation forwarded to Secretary Ray
! mond in January last. Considerable cor
respondence followed, and in the mean
time W. C. Ralston, during an Eastern
' visit, did yeoman work among members
I of the council. As is the proper practice
of the association, letters were addressed
to California members of the Institute,
inquiring if a meeting here would be a
success. All replies were cordially favor
able, and the result of the total efforts
made was the selection in February last
of San Francisco as the next meeting
place. The long labors Riven to the suc
ceeding preparations for the meeting by
the association are another story."

"CORDIAL WELCOME TO THE MINING
CAMP OF 1849"--MAYOR PHELAN
San Francisco owes the splendid impetus its early growth received
to the mines of California. To-day the mines are still a great source
of the prosperity of city and State, and, with the passing of primitive
methods, will contribute still more in the future by the application of
scientific knowledge by competent engineers. The visit, therefore, of the
American Institute of Mining Engineers is most timely. They are
welcome to the mining camp of 1849, which is now the metropolis of
1899. This should be for them a congenial field, and without any for
mal greeting they should feel at home. Our citizens, respecting and
honoring their profession and recalling the State's history as "the land
of gold," cordially welcomes the institute to California.
JAMES D. PHELAN, Mayor.
San Francisco, September 24.
PRESIDENT NEFF'S WORDS OF WELCOME.
THE American Institute of Mining Engineers is the most important
body and almost the only one connected with the mining industry
that has ever visited California. It comprises a membership from all
over the world, and it is composed of eminent men whose opinions are
valued everywhere. We expect that they will give our mines and min
eral resources an intelligent inspection, and we do not fear the result.
The California Miners' Association brought these distinguished
leaders of the mining industry here, and its members are highly grat
ified at their arrival. Through its executive and general reception com
mittees and its local organizations in various counties it has arranged
to offer a cordial California welcome and to show them all of the mining
resources of the State that can be seen in the limited time at the dis
posal of the vests. In behalf of the organized mining men of the State
who in these days appreciate the value of brains and intelligence in
the mining industry, I greet these guests of California.
J. H. NEFF,
President California Miners' Association.

SECRETARY RAYMOND PREDICTS
MINING PROGRESS IN CALIFORNIA
RKPPTXO, Sept. 24.â "We expect
the present meeting to stir up in
terest in the Institute on the Pa
cific Coast, and that we will heai
more from the mining engineers of th(
coast in the -future," said Secretarj
Raymond to-day. "We are all. oi
course, pleased to be in California
Since I was here, a comparativelj
short time ago, there have been a
number of important developments
including the copper mine we saw to
day. A number of deep mines on thÂ«
mother lode have shown great im
provement and important develop
ments. The State's largest progress
I think, will attend the cheapening ol
operations. The great thing now is
the working of large bodies of low
grade ore. There should he a great
progress in mining in California In thÂ«
next few years, for recent develop
ments have revealed possibilities, anc
there is no reason why these discover
ies should not be repeated.
"The meetings of the institute art
largely social, the papers prepared and
presented being published promptly
and going to every member of the in
stitute, who is kept in touch with th<
best current thought and practice In
his field. The meetings foster a feel-
ing of association and fraternity in the profession and a loyalty to the institute
and they stimulate men who have acquired new knowledge to prepare reports
which they would not otherwise do. Our membership is not confined to the fields
of mining, metallurgy and economic geology with a standard of technical ac
quirements, but is open to practical mining men as well."
PUBLISHER OF IRON AGE TALKS OF TRIP.
REDDING, Sept. 24.â David Williams,
publisher of the Iron Age, in a talk with
The (Jail correspondent to-day said:
"The party with which I am visiting
California is making a summer trip of
about five weeks through some of the
great western mineral regions of the
United States, making the San Francisco
meeting of the American Institute of
Mining Engineers, In which we are
greatly interested, the excuse and oc
casion for spending this time in learning
more about the mineral industry of the
country, and in enjoying the scenic
beauties of the West. We are combining
pleasure with profit. We will not have
time for detailed study of anything, but
will acquire, I hope, an enlarged concep
tion of the country's mineral resources.
We have already been impressed with the
magnitude and importance of what little
we have seen on the trip, Including what
we saw to-day.
Having been only twenty-four hours in.

the State, I will say little about Califor
nia. Many of the party have said that
they are already paid for taking the trip.
Many men of the party are closely identi
fied with the silver and gold features of
this Industry, which I am not. As Jo the
possibilities of iron production on the Pa
cific Coast, of which I am asked to say
something briefly, T will simply remark
that it is a large problem which I would
rather be excused from discussing. This
coast has great and rich deposits of iron
ore, but unfortunately the coal problem
Is the biggest one. The days of charcoal
are long past, and while the water power
of this State will make a wonderfull in
dustrial development in some fields, we
have not yet got to smelting by elec
tricity. The possibilities of Chinese coal
following the development of those coal
fields with cheap labor have been dis
cussed, and 1 cannot now see why Chinese
coal cannot be- made available for smelt
ing iron in California. China is prac
tically closer to California than Mon
tana." t

OF A NEW
MINING PROSPERITY
CALIFORNIA ENJOYS A GREAT PROSPECTING BOOM.
A Canvass of the State Demonstrates That Unusual Activity in the Mining
Industry Prevails.
HERE is a current record that may |
suggest to judicious minds that
California is not "worked out," :
from a mining standpoint. It is
worthy of a little attention amid the
crowding facts of this State's mining in
dustry and mineral resources.
The Call herewith presents a fractional,
but still striking, record of the number of
new mining locations made in California
during; eight months of 1899. This record
is gathered from counties of all grades of
mining activity and for the period covered
the complete record would undoubtedly
exceed in averages, etc., the totals here
given.
The Call recently sent inquiries concern
ing the number of mining locations filed
and some other current features of the
industry to county officials or correspond
ents in each county. Many have not yet
replied, but the showing here made is
sufficient for the general purpose of -â¢â¢'
--ting forth one evidence of the present
mining activity in California and offering
one suggestion of the State's future min
ing possibilities.
The record, given in detail below, shows
that during eight months of the current
year (J124 mining location notices were filed |
In twenty-two of the fifty-seven counties
of the State. If this ratio were kept up :
to the end of the year there would be 9186
mining locations "recorded in only these
twenty-two counties during 1599, the aver
age for these counties being _',>. If the
iiity - two present mineral-producing ,
<'ou~nties out of the whole tifty
seven counties sustained this aver
age the number for the fifty-two
counties for eight months would be 14,466,
and f'<r the whole year 21,684. Anything
like tliis would be a pretty good record
for brand new mines, or "prospects," in
one State in one year, and it closely ap
proximates the true situation.
The r,umber of locations reported by
counties is its follows:
Shasta 1,4*9 Amador 80
Del Norte SSEI Dorado 46X '
Plumas 243 Mariposa 316
Modoc 3 Tuolumne 491
Lassen 24 ! Merced 126

C'oiusa 2S;i ] Orange 43 j
I^ake "-â '> .San Diego 530 :
Xapa 31 j j
j'laeer ml Total 6.124
People familiar with the mining situa
tion in this State will observe that several
of the mining counties in which there Is
jiot only great mining activity but a targe
proportion of mineral land open to pros
ju-ctors are not here reported. Notable
among these are Siskiyou and Trinity
counties. which share Shasta'a mining
characteristics and which would be found i
closely approaching Shasta's record. Cal
avems on the mother lode, Is not reported.
There are no returns from Fresno, with
its remarkable oil boom, or from its sis
ter Madera. Prospecting is specially ac
tive over the great mineralized desert re
gion of Southern California, as Kern
County's record helps to show, but neither
San Bernardino nor Riverside are includ
ed. It would seom a fai!Â» assumption that !
the averages and totals given above
should be raised.
SHASTA.
This county, whose copper output of
$2,465,830 in 183S, added to its gold, etc..

DWHL NoRTE.
Little Del Norte County, away up in
irner of the Stato, by the
sea and far from railroads, has much un- '
developed and unprospected mineral
wealth. Mining activity is being resumed
for the first time in many years. Copper
ore Is being shipped by sea and a number
of copper and gold mines are undergoing
development. The record of locations
reads: February. 8; March. 7; April. 5;
May. 7: June, 17; July, 13; August. 1.

The correspondent writes: "The mining
industry of Del Norte County is prac
tically undeveli ped, but it is not from
the lack of minerals, in which the mount
ains are rich. The lack of shipping facil
ities is the greatest bar to the develop
ment of thÂ«- mines. Copper has been
mined and is at present mined to an ex
tent that demonstrates that it exists in

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, SKFTEMBJSK 25, !Â»Â»Â».
Scammon. comes the report: "There is
very little mining done in this county,
there being only threÂ« mining notices filed
in this office since last January. There
are no mines in operation in this county
that I know of."
LASSEN.
Lassen County includes a great northern
mineral region in the Sierras and is one
of those out-of-the-way counties Buffering
from neglect through lack of ready com
munication. The report from Lassen
County includes the following: "The con
dition of the mining industry in Lassen
County is far better and more hopeful
than for ten years last past. More pros
pecting is being done and with better re
sults. More capital is being invested in
i mining properties than ever before in the
history of the county." The total number
of lode locations filed was twenty-four.
There were no placer locations. Twelve
mining properties wnre deeded and two
bonded.
BUTTB.
Butte County displays forty-one quartz
and sixty-six placer locations, a total of
107 and fifty-seven transfers of mining
properties. The placer locations have
mainly been with a view to dredging and
several gold dredgers will soon be added
to the five now operating on the Feather
River.
YUBA.
Tuba County is small and has much
fruit, but its early settled eastern end
reaches Into the mineralized Sierra Ne
vada foothills and the Yuba River pro
vides one of the coming dredging fields.
Yuba's report is:
The outlook for the mining industry in
this county has not been better for twen
ty years, although the records show that
there have been only nineteen location
notices filed, one-third the number that
were filed during the same period last
year This is accounted for by the fact
that most of the claims are located and
now the owners are working them. There
is great activity in placer mining on the
rubs River by means of dredgers. The
introduction of electricity Into several
districts has made it possible to work
profitably many mines that have lain idle
for years. Twenty sales and three bonds
have been recorded.
ALPINE.
Little Alpine County, perched up In the
Sierra Nevadas, has Its share of new min
ing activity, but only forty-five location
notices we're filed with County Clerk
Prank Smith.
COLUSA.
Coiusa County has been one of the
smallest mineral producers In the State,
but the recent oil and copper booms have
â  stimulated great activity in prospecting
i this county's latent resources of these
I products. "The number of location no
ttcec, which is surprisingly large, is re
ported as follows:
January. 4 copper; February, 11 copper;
March, 4 copper; April, 8 copper; May, 1
j copper and 123 placer oil locations; June,
28 oil; July, 58 oil; August. 45 oil. Total,
copper 29 and oil 264. Grand total, 293.
LAKE.
Lake County is reported on In the fol
lowing comprehensive way by County Re
corder Frank VV. Beach:
"Mining claims filed in Lake County are
generally cinnabar claims. There have
been twenty-five claims recorded so far
in the year 1599.
"There has been no appreciable Increase
in the mining industry in Lake County
this year, although some of the old mines
have been enlarged and furnaces rebuilt,
with one new furnace at the Abbott.
"The survival or non-survival of the
State mining law will have but little ef
fect upon the industry as a whole in the
county. One group of tilings in the Mor
gan Valley section of the county, the ore
<f which is phenomenally rich, through a
misapprehension oi the exact status of
the mining law. aiv in a muddle and will
probably go into the courts to have the.
matter adjusted. One other, the Bullion,
is now in litigation, but the validity of
the State law cannot affect it. All the
Inrcer quicksilver producing mines in
Lake County, such as the Great Western,
Str.ndard. Sulphur Bank. Abbott, et al.,
have acquired title in a large measure
through agricultural patent and hence
cannot be touched by any phase of this
law." _________
NAPA.
Napa County is fourteenth in rank
among the counties of the State in min
eral production, which amounted to $sf>s,-
OGfi in 1898, because of its quicksilver,
mineral water? and magnesite. in each of
whi'-h it leads all the counties of the
State. It has no other mineral products
worthy of mention. Increased mining
activity is reported this year. The mining
locations in this well settled horticultural
county were: January, 7; March. 11; May,
6; June, 1; July, 1; August, 5. Total, 31.
PLACER.
In Placer County 121 locations in eight

ganized districts, but the district records
of the Volcano and Clinton districts have
been returned to those districts. There
were eighty-one mining properties sold
and nineteen bonded.
EL DORADO.
The number of claims recorded In El
Dorado County during the present year
was as follows: January, 92; February.
65; March, 6Â«; April. 37; May, 41; June, 22;
July, 41; August, 24; September, 8; total,
"Only two mining districts have been or
ganized in the county since the repeal of
the mining act of 1897," writes the corre
spondent, "one at Georgetown and one
at Volcanoville. In both cases demands
were made upon the County Recorder for
the return of the mining records of the
districts, which upon legal advice were
refused.
"There has been much development
work during the year and all in all the
outlook for the steady and profitable ex
ploiting of the quartz mines of the old
empire county was never brighter than
to-day. With the other mining counties
along the great lode El Dorado has suf-

fered from a scant water supply during
the present season, but this will vanish
with the first fall rains."
MARIPOSA.
The heart of the mineral region of Mari
posa County is the great Mariposa grant
of many thousands of acres, in which no
prospector may locate and which was re
cently sold to a London syndicate. Out
side of the grant there were 316 locations
filed as follows: January. 50; February,
41- March. 43: April. 36; May, 50; June, 27;
July 4(i: August, 23.
Twenty-eight mining properties have
been sold and seven bonded.
TUOLUMNE.
Tuolumne County, third in rank in gold
production and fourth in total mineral
production, is about the liveliest of the
mining counties of the great mother lode
region. Though it has been mined and
prospected steadily since 1849, its hills
have been full of prospectors, as the fol
lowing record of mining locations shows:
Lode locations under State law of 1897,

were tiled in July and 38 in August. Ah
of these were oil claims.
AL.AMEDA.
In populous Alameda County, down on
the bay shore, with coal, chrome and oil
to mainly tempt mining enterprise, there
were three mining locations riled.
MONTEREY.
They are busily hunting oil in Monterey
County, where during eight months of the
year eighty-five placer and eight lode lo
cations were filed. The placer locations
were distributed as follows: January, 1;
February, 1; March, 22; April, 16; May, 36;
June. 3; August. <">.
KERN.
Kern County has made a big record in
mineral locations, largely on account of
the oil boom, though much prospecting is
going on through its Sierra Nevada and
desert mineral regions, where great un
developed gold and other mineral re
sources abound. The lode and placer lo
cations were as follows: January, 248;
February. 1!)3; March. 162: April, 167; May.
268; June , 347; July, 153; August, 7G. Total,

nia is being rapidly increased by Orange
County, in the northern part of which a
fine field has been lately developed. The
location notices filed, almost entirely for
oil claims, were as follows: January, 4;
February. 1: March, 4; April, 5: May, 6;

INSTITUTE'S GREAT INFLUENCE ON MINING PROGRESS.
THE mining men of California and the
coast cordially welcome the visiting I
members of the American Institute of
Mining Engineers. Many prominent
representatives of the institute are not
strangers, for in ranging round the earth
in quest of treasure some have frequently
visited California and her sister States
and Territories. But it is the first time ,
that the greatest technical society in the
world has held one of its meetings west
of the Sierras. Established In 1871 and
embracing in its membership most of the j
leaders in mining and metallurgy, the
influence of the institute has been great
on mining and scientific progress, and in
every part of the world are found mem- |
bers of that gTeat organization at the
head of development work.
In accordance with the gigantic scale
on which everything is done in California,
whether welcoming veterans of war or
captains of peace, a big programme is
mapped out, which with the business ses
sions of the next three days will tax the
receptive facult.es of the visitors, jt
were better, perhaps, had they been able
to come before the foothill streams of the
early year had dwindled to the dry and
dusty channels of to-day, but if their
presence or their counsel can in any way
aid in the movement toward conservation
of water in California now in progress,
such aid will be one of the most valuable
results of their visit.

A DEEP INSIDE OF PROSPERITY
rEW persons, even those in active trade, realize |
how many things' have advanced in price during
the past few months, and particularly during the
past few weeks. Exclusive of the great staples, the
list embraces ail sorts of articles, even to writing
paper, lead pencils and pins, so that it now costs more
money to oven order goods than formerly, not to
mention paying for. them. Almost everything that the
housewife uses has gone up, as the head of the family
is ling out to his disgust, and it costs considerably
more to run the family than it did a year ago. And.
the end is apparently not yet. No such rise in com
modities has been seen since the civil war, nearly forty:
ago.
The money, market is beginning to show signs of
strain on account of this general advance in the neces
saries of life. The circulation is being drawn upon to
pay for goods and the New York banks find their
legal reserve? shrinking under the drain, especially as
the interior banks are drawing on the New York
banks for cash funds to move the crops. The Govern
ment has helped the situation by paying the October
bond interest in advance, as on former similar occa
sions, and the banks themselves will find other means
of relief, so there is no cause for alarm. The case is
cited merely to show that even prosperity sometimes
causes financial stringency, just as it threw a large
number of men out of work a fortnight or so ago be
cause the shipbuilding works could not get the raw
material to work on, owing to the immense demand
from all over the country. Both cases are peculiar,
if not unique.
The present advance in prices has another curious
feature. It will be news to -many that the manufac
turer, in spite of the general advance in his wares, is '
deriving very little benefit from it. It appears that the
rise in raw products has been so sharp that the maim l
focturer his been unable to advance his selling, prices
for manufactured goods in a corresponding ratio, for
while the latter are much higher than for some time
they have not kept pace with the increased price of '
ra.v material, and, what is of equal importance, the
rise in wages. This is prominently exhibited in the
woolen trade and many other lines. Thus, while
labor has advanced from 10 to 15 per cent boots and
shoes have risen only 4 per cent, while leather has
gone up 8 per cent. Wool has advanced 10.9
per cent, but woolen goods only 5.2 per cent,
which, in view of the IO@IS per cent increase in la
bor, gives the manufacturer less benefit than appears
at the fir: I glance. Everything put up in tin has ad
vanced, but the enormous rise in tin. combined with
the increase in wages, cuts down the packer's profits
materially. And so on. down the whole list of com
modities. From this it would appear that the pro
ducer and wnge-e:<rner are getting much more out of
the current prosperity than the manufacturer, who is
popularly supposed to get the lion's <=harÂ» of every
thing.
For the rest the situation exhibits no new features.
The weekly commercial reports sing the same unvary
ing song of marked gains in bank clearings, decreased
failures, a great wholesale and jobbing trade in almost
every line of goods, feverish activity in all branches
of the iron and steel trades and their subdivisions,,
with prices for merchandise of all descriptions mount
ing skyward. Of the eighty-three American cities
and towns reporting bank clearings only eight
showed a decrease last week, while the average gain i
all over the country was 4,1 per cent, and every large !,
city except Omaha recorded a gain over 1898. The
failures were 147, against I&2 - m the same week last ;
year.
The conditions on this coast are merely a reflex
of the wonderful prosperity general throughout the
other parts of the country. They are familiar to all
who keep in touch with trade conditions and have
been recounted time and again. Suffice it to say
that business is better in California to-day than for
a exeat many years, and that there are no complaints j
from any quarter.
Several prominent Democrats of Massachusetts'
have declined renominntions for State positions. This j
seems to be another verification of the belief that I
there are some people that have conscientious scruples j
against taking anything that is worth nothing. I
CONGRESS AND THE COLD STANDARD.
WITH the opening of the fall campaigns, pub
lic interest in all political questions revives
and renewed attention is paid to issue? which
have to some extent been overlooked by reason of
the general concern in the questions raised by the
war in the Philippines. Among these issues that of
confirming the gold standard and reforming the
currency laws of" the nation naturally comes first,
and it is gratifying to note that despite opposition
from a certain class of Republicans, the sentiment of
the party and its leaders and representatives is
strongly in favor of the enactment of a comprehen
sive act upon the subject at the coming session of
Congress.
Representative McLeary of Minnesota, who is one
of the best informed men in Congress on currency
questions and who is in rlc=e touch with influential
Republicans in the House, has recently declared a
sanguine expectation that the issue will be one of
the first to be taken up during the session, and that
the plan outlined by the Atlantic City conference
will be substantially adopted. That plan it will be
remembered includes a declaration for the gold
standard so formulated That only by act of Congress
can the monetary standard be changed, the protec
tion of the gold reserve from what has been termed
the "endless chain." the authorization of bank note
issues to the par value of the United States bonds
deposited as security, and the establishment of banks
in less populated communities on a reduced capital.
The Republican State conventions which have
been held this year have strongly and clearly de
ciared for the gold standard and a scientific revision
of our currency laws. Moreover these platform
promises have been emphatically repeated by the
candidates nominated upon them. From one end of
the country to the other the voice of sterling Re
publicanism has been unmistakable on that point,
and the few time-serving politicians who counsel
delay or compromise have had no influence what
ever either in the party conventions or in the cam
paigns.
In opening the Republican canvass in Ohio on Sat
urday Judge Nash reminded the voters of the State
that the money question is still one of the issues of
the politics of the country' and could not be evaded
either by the people or by Congress. "The Demo
cratic party." lie said, "continues to demand the free
and unlimited coinage of silver and gold as equal
in primary money at the ratio of 16 to I," and if
Ohio give its vote to that party the effect would be
to revive the whole agitation and once more disturb
the finances and the industries of the country. "Our
prosperity, 'â  he added, "is due to the determination
of the American people to maintain inviolate and
forever a sound financial policy in this land.
By the elections in 1806 confidence was restored in
the financial integrity of the people of the United
States. Hence, those who controlled capital were
willing to let it seek investment in railroads, manu
factures and commerce. The unemployed are no
longer idle. Those who worked only one-half time
and for half pay are now reaping a full harvest."
These stalwart declarations for the right are the
more gratifying because, as the Philadelphia Public
Ledger has pointed out: "Certain Republican jour
nalists and politicians profess that the currency laws
are good enough as they are: that what is essential
is the retention of the Republican party in power and
the maintenance of revenue laws that shall avert a
deficiency in the Treasury. This view of the situa
tion i? "childlike and bland" rather than convincing.
It ignores the possibility of contingencies 4 that can
not definitely be anticipated in time to make prep
aration for unusual demands on the Treasury."
The business interests of the country require a
prompt settlement of the whole money question.
The gold standard must be confirmed and the con
fusion in the currency laws brought to order by the
adoption of a scientific and sound monetary system.
That is one of the thing 3 expected of Congress at
the coming session, and it is encouraging to note
that all signs point to the conclusion the expectation
will be realized.
Chicago i? having such a big silver punchbowl pre
pared for the battleship Illinois that the people there,
do not speak of having it made but of having it
erected. It is going to be soriiething monumental,
and it would seem that in an emergency it might be
used as a lifeboat.
Mrs. Mary Brooks, the first woman sentenced to
the Michigan State prison at Jackson, is about lo

her up. She has consented to marry him.
EXPANSION AND COTTON
SENATOR MORGAN has addressed a com
mercial argument to the Southern cotton
planters to show their interest in imperialism,
lie says that "the time is coming when an American
city in the Pacific islands will handle two-thirds of
the cotton in the world."
The Tacoma Ledger is charmed with this prospect
and observes that "thousands of bales of American
cotton have been shipped from Tacoma in the last
two years, and cotton manufacturing machinery is
going the same way. The Asiatics are the great
est consumers of cotton in the world, and instead
of relying on Manchester are beginning to manu
facture thrir own goods."
It seems, then, that we are to rely on the produc
tion of raw material to be manufactured by the cheap
skilled labor of Asia. Perhaps the Ledger will cite
the example of any nation that has grown rich on the
production of raw material. The foundation of the
Republican theory of protection is the stimulation of
manufacture, not the production of raw material to
be transmuted by the skill of others. A=ia and
Africa always had cotton. When Europe was dress
ing in the skins of animals, and later when the people
of the Western nations wore coarse woollen fabrics,
Asia and Africa had the finest cotton and linen. The
cerements of Egyptian mummies, laid away three
thousand years ago, are of cotton and linen, so finely
woven as to prove the hifiheÂ«t skill in manufacture
and the production of the raw fiber.
Senator Morgan's American city in the Pacific
islands will not long handle American cotton after
the manufacturing machinery is put in operation.
There are vast reaches of land in Asia and Africa,
virgin and unexhausted, that will produce cotton. It
is a law of economics that where nature permits the
production, the raw material and its manufacture
come close together. The planting of cotton mills in
Asia to be run with cheap labor means the raising of
Asiatic raw cotton by still cheaper labor, and our
expansion, achieved at great cost, will mean the
transfer of an industry from the mjdst of us to the
mid<=t of the cheap labor of the Orient.
The Ledger declares that "if any people in this
country should be interested in the retention of the
Philippines it is the cotton growers of the South."
That is true, but their interest is against such reten
tion if it be to introduce the very changes in Asia
foretold by Morgan and the Ledger.
Our cotton trade with Asia and pceanica for the
THE SAN FKANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 25, 1899.
| three years 1897-99, fiscal years, has shown great
1 fluctuations, as follows, in bales exported:
I 8&7 '. 60,756
lj,f)B . . . 225,552
1899..! 177,700
So that since we began political expansion toward
Asia we have shrunk in otir cotton exports there
47.852 bales. It is noteworthy that in 1897 Spain took
of t'> 266,388 bales, or more than four times as much
ar; all Asia and Oceanica.
But a little while ago the friends of our protective
system were alarmed at the obvious awakening of
Japan and China to the profits of manufacturing by
the me of their cheap labor. Some branches of man
ufacture are not in immediate danger of domestica
tion there, 'such as the metal and machinery trades,
which will profit in supplying machinery; but the
textile manufacture can go there, and the production
of fiber can follow it, for nature offers no bar thereto.
I When Asiatic cheap labor and improved machinery
' are brought in conjunction, this generation can see
the end of the American cotton industry. Our total
cotton export to the world has fallen off already. In
bales and value for the fiscal years 1898 and 1899 it
was :
ISÂ«Kâ bales 7.551 ,004
JB9Sâ value $230,442,215
1599-bales 7,373,382
IS99â value $209,564,774
The shrinkage in bales was 207,622, and in value $20,
--877,441. It would seem, then, that the swell in the
cotton trade since we began expanding, that the
Ledger professes to have seen, does not exist, and its
deduction from a non-existent fact is like many
others which are published to make the people pa
tier t while they pay the cost of an adventure which
will lave in it but little profit and a very indifferent
article of glory-
SOUTH AMERICAN ALARMISTS.
SINCE the outburst of foolish boasting on the
part of the imperialists of the country there
have come to us many reports of the alarm
felt in South America lest in our lust for conquest
and dominion we set about subverting first Mexico
| and afterward all the country southward until we in
â  elude among our colonial possessions the whole of
j Spanish America.
An alarm of the kind is so unreasonable the re-
I ports have been regarded in this country with mi
i difference and dismissed from consideration as idle
! rumors. They have now been repeated so often,
however, and come to us from so many different
sources that it is just as well for us to give heed to
them. It is true all such fears on the part of Mexico
or any Central or South American country are with
out foundation, but so long as any considerable num
ber of people feel them the effect upon the interna-
I tional relations between ourselves and our southern
| neighbors is bound to be great.
We desire the commerce of South America, and
trade, like kissing, "goes by favor."' The Euro
peans, who are our competitors in the markets of
Spanish America, will of course make use of every
possible appeal to prejudice to stimulate antagonism
to the United States for the purpose of checking the
consumption of our goods as far a? possible. In
that respect the rumors of a probable attempt at
subverting the independence of the South American
states may do a great deal of harm in more ways
than one.
This feeling of uneasiness among a people with
whom we desire friendly relations is one of the evil
results of the jingo boasting over the proposed policy
of commercial expansion by means of imperial con
j quests. Senseless in itself, that kind of talk has given
rise to senseless fears, and it may require years of
diplomacy to overcome the bad effects, which have
already become of no small magnitude. Folly at
home begets folly abroad, and out of the two there
come manifold injuries to the true interests of both
parties.
In reality every American knows the states to the
south of us have nothing to fear from our aggression
and everything to expect from our friendship. The
trade between the two continents of this hemisphere
ought to be large, and it is our duty to take the
initiative in making it so, and yet it is our own swag
gering imperialists who are giving occasion for the
fears which are engendering the South American
antagonisms of which we are now hearing so much.
THE DEADLY THIRD RAIL.
FROM reports that come to us from the East con
cerning the number of fatal accidents caused by
the third rail which is now coming into use on
electric railroads in that section it is evident that in
the new system of traction we have another of those
deadly forces which constitute a menace to civilized
communities.
Recently a track-walker on the Brooklyn Elevated
Railroad stumbled and fell, and as his body came into
contact with the third rail he was instantly killed.
Commenting upon the accident the New York
Tribune says: "The incident was a startling reminder
that this third rail, which is so useful, which looks sj
innocent and which is so accessible to the touch of
accident or thoughtlessness, is charged with lethal
energy so great that the slightest touch thereof is
death. In case of a blockade on the elevated road,
which is not an infrequent occurrence, passengers are
wont to leave a stalled train and walk along the tracks
to the nearest station. That formerly could be done
with safety. Now they must walk within a few inches
of a thunderbolt. The rail runs close by station plat
j forms, where one may easily touch it with the tip of
a walking stick, and where one accidentally slipping
down upon the track or getting down to recover some
object that had fallen thither would almost certainly
come in contact with it. Such are the perils on an
elevated road. On a surface road these would of
course be greatly increased and multiplied."
On this coast we have had no experience as yet
with the third rail system. It is only a matter of time,
however, when it will be introduced here, for it is of
great advantage in electric roads. It is as well, there
fore, for us to give heed now to the dangers that ac
company its use in order to guard against them when
any application is made for the right to use the sys
tem either in the cities or along country highways.
Efforts are now being made in the East to miti
gate the danger of the system, and doubtless good
results will be obtained. It is believed it will be prac
ticable eventually to use a rail which will carry no
electric charge save at the moment and the point of
contact with the car motor. Should that be accom
plished the third rail will be the best of electric sys
tems now known, but until that time comes it is best
to leave the dangerous third rail alone or else hedge
its use with the most stringent safeguards.
An official of the Agricultural Department is com
ing to this State to give our fruit-growers informa
tion as to the best means of cultivating the Smyrna
fig. and it will not be inappropriate to wish the State
msÂ«r give the nation many a fig for it in return.
Another submarine boat has been "successfully
tested," and it is possible she may be of some use in
war, but the record of other craft of her kind that
were tested with equal success is not encouraging.

Annual Meeting of the Association
Held Yesterday and Ways and
Means for the Current
Year Discussed. .
Â«
The annual meeting of the Pacific He- |
brew Orphan Asylum f and Home Society
occurred yesterday afternoon at the ;
orphange gymnasium at Devisadero and !
Hayes streets. A number of the wealth
iest and most prominent members of the ;
association were present, among them A. j
Anspacher, Joseph Brandensteln, J. f
Stern, J. Greenebaum, Daniel Roth, Ben
Schloss, Lewis Meyerstein, Heny L.
Simon, N. Schlessinger, M. J. Sahlein and <
J. H. Neustadter.
The report of S. W. Levy, president of
the association, did not Indicate that the
institution was in as thriving a financial
condition as in years past, and an urgent
appeal was made for those who were in
terested in the association and Its good
work to give their spare time and efforts
to increasing the membership roll. Not- i
: withstanding that there was a deficit for
! the year of $13,991 79, the report of Su- ;
j perintendent Henry Mauser showed that
there had been just as much, if not more, .
good work done than in ay of the eight
years past. Concerning the membership
of the society, President Levy said in his |
report:
In my last annual report I stated that the ,
membership was 1325. Since then we have ad
mitted 25 and lost 94, leaving 1756 as our â 
present membership. Of those dropped from
membership 29 have ' died, 52 have resigned i
and 12 have been stricken from the rolls for ,
non-payment of dues. You will notice that j
the same Indifference to the cry of the orphans
and the wail of The aged was apparent lant
year as in years gone by. Of those who have |
died I can only say: "May their spirits nnd ;
rest and their memory be honored." j
Of the Old People's Home Mr. Levy re- I
ported as follows: "In my last report I ]
stated the number of inmates as 21 men
j and 13 women. Since that time we have
I admitted 7, discharged 1 and lost by
death 6, leaving at the present time 21 i
men and 13 women in our charge. j
The financial condition of the society he ;
summed up as follows: "Our entire in- \
come en which both the asylum and Old â¢
People's Home depend for their main- j
tenance, amounted to $28,197 53. This sum j
includes bequests, donations, interest,
dues and all other items received by the
society. For the past year the expense
of conducting the asylum has been $30,
--334 30 and the home $11,588 52, making a
total of $41,922 S2 for carrying on both in- |
stitutions. Added to this there is $266 00, ,
| caused by non-payment of dues, making |
I the total expenses of the sociey $42,189 32. ' <
Superintendent Mauser set forth the ,
i number of wards in the asylum as follows:
"On September 1, 1898. we had 151 chil
dren; 70 girls and 81 boys. During the
year 28 were admitted and 21 discharged;
leaving our number at present 158; 74 girls I
and 84 boys. Their ages range from 3
to 16 years, the average age being 9 years. J
The total number cared for during the
year was 179." r S-'C'i - ,
The annual election was not held, but
a nominating committee was appointed
and the directors will select the officers
some time.next month.

are not the forerunner of anything seri
ous in the way of upheavals in office. The
letter is particularly flattering to Section

NEWS OF FOREIGN NAVIES.
A new type of torpedo boat for the
German navy has just been launched from
Shichan's yard at Elbing. It is 223 feet
in length. 9 feet draught and has a trial
speed of 36 knots. Until further improve
: ments suggest themselves this type will
j be the standard torpedo boat in the Ger-
I man- navy.
The Italian battleships Ttalia and T.e
panto, of 14.400 tons, are to be stripped of
their armor and converted into cruisers.
j The gain by removal of armor will be
utilized in coal stowage, and the new
bunkers, sixteen feet wide, will afford
! great protection to the machinery. The
Italia was built in 1880 and the T.epanto
three years later, and they were very
; speedy ships. Converted Into cruisers,
| their four 100-ton guns will be removed
and four ten-inch and a number of quick
firing six-inch guns will be substituted.
The Pallada. a protected cruiser of 6731
; tons, was launched August 27 from the
' new admiralty yard. Galierny Island. St.
j Petersburg. She is 416 feet in length. 54
. feet 4 Inches beam and 21 feet draft. The
machinery, triple expansion engines and
twenty-four Belleville boilers, is to de
' velop 11.610 horsepower, to give a speed of
! twenty knots, and the armament is com-
I posed of eight six-inch, twenty-four three
-1 inch quick firing guns and eight six
! pounders, and the vessel has also two
broadside and one bow torpedo tube. The
Diana and Aurora, sister ships to the Pal-
I lada, are still on the stocks at Galierny
! Island, although they were begun early
j in 1897.
The trouble with the British battleship
! Ocean has been discovered to be in the
! cracked high-pressure cylinder of the
l port engine, and extensive repairs and
considerable loss of time will be entailed
!at the dockyard. As the vessel has not
yet been accepted by the admiralty the
loss falls on the contractors. Few ships
in the British navy pass through their
trials without accidents or defects being
found in their machinery. In contrast to
this, it Is exceedingly rare that United
States vessels meet with accidents during
their trials or that defects of a serious
nature are developed, such being chiefly
confined to the torpedo boats, and these
are proportionately less than what hap
pens to British boats.
Peter the Great's first attempt to utilize
the navy he had built and organized with
so much trouble was a signal failure. The
first squadron was sent to sea In 1713 to
fight Russia's old enemy, Sweden, in -the
Baltic, and three Swedish vessels of in
ferior force were overtaken. During the
engagement the Russian vice admiral's
ship and that of the senior captain com
modore ran aground, and the junior cap
tain commodore failed to render assist
ance, and the Swedes escaped. For this
the two senior Russian officers were de
graded a-nd the junior captain commodore
I was sentenced to be shot. At the last
I moment, when the culprit stood blindfold
| ed awaiting thy volley from the executton
| ers, the! death .sentence was remitted, but
the fright he had experienced had upset
his reason, and he lingered but a few
years in Siberia, a mental wreck. The
! early Russian navy had many Scotchmen
I and Englishmen in it as officers, one of
I the latter, named Nelson, serving as cap
i tain, and was a member of the first court
â¢ martial which gave the Russian officers
j a taste of naval discipline.
Germany has been rather unsuccessful
iin its earlier armored shipbuilding. Four
', second-class battleships, or rather coast
i defense vessels, built in 1878 and 1880,
i named Baden, Bayern, Sachsen and Wur
; temberg. of 7441 tons, were practically fail
ures, and had to be almost reconstructed
three years ago. The German navy also
possesses six coast defense ships of 3500
I tons of the monitor type, but having high
I unprotected upper works, which make the
; vessels unseaworthy and absolutely
I worthless as lighting vessels. They were
| built in 1890-1-2-3, and although rated at
: sixteen knots they are in reality slow
| ships. Their coal capacity is only 225
tons, and In order to remedy this defect
jit has been decided to reconstruct the
; Hagen, launched in 1893. It is intended to
| cut the vessel in two and put in twenty
five feet additional hull between the two
; ends, thereby increasing the coal-carrying
| capacity. The upper works will also be
j greatly reduced. If the plan proves a
I success with ;he Hagen the other vessels
! of that class, namely, Beowulff, Heimdal
Hildebrand, Frlthjoy and Siegfried, will
be similarly reconstructed.

MRS.LILLIE GRAY DEFENDS HER
HOME WITH A REVOLVER,
â¦
She Is Arrested on a Charge of As
sault With a Deadly Weapon
and He Is Also in ,
Custody.
Â«
Mrs. Lillie Gray, a young widow living
at 462% Tehama street, created a mild
sensation in the neighborhood yesterday
afternoon by firing two shots through
a door at Charles C. Schwebs, who had
been trying to force an entrance into her
room. ".::!'
Mrs. Gray was left a widow about a
year ago, and as she was acquainted
I with the Schwebs family, Schwebs went
to live in her house to help her along. He
I has been employed as a tin-roofer for
nearly twenty years by Conlin & Rob
erts, on Mission street. Mrs. Gray and
Schwebs had reason to disagree lately
and she . got him to leave the house.
Early yesterday morning he went to her
house drunk and because she refused to
admit him he commenced to hammer at
the front door with the object of break
ing his way in. He was arrested, but
only a charge of "drunk" was booked
! against him and he was discharged by
i Judge Graham. . >
As soon as Schwebs regained his liberty
I he commenced to drink again and went
| in the afternoon to Mrs. Gray's house.
i She again refused to admit him and ho
I began to break in the door. Exasperated
! at hi% conduct she fired two shot from a
revolver through the door, both missing
him.
Schwebs, thoroughly frightened, ran
Into ..a saloon adjoining the house and
made his way to the rear, climbing to
, the roof. He ran over the roof, dropped
onto a shed in the rear of the house on
j the other side of the saloon and took
I refuge in the basement, where he was
I found by Policemen T. P. Riordan and
John A. Ryan, who had been notified of
the shooting. The officers placed him
j under arrest, and on hearing his story
I went to Mrs. Gray's house and arrested
| her. The revolver was taken as evi
l dence against her.
Captain Spillane ordered a charge of as
i sault with a deadly weapon to be booked,
j against Mrs. Gray and a charge of dis
-1 turbing the peace against Schwebs.
Schwebs declared with tears in his eyes
i that he did not want to prosecute the
} woman, as he loved her still, although
she preferred a soldier. He offered her
his hand in a friendly way, but she
scorned him and said she â¢wanted to have
nothing further to do with him.
"I only fired the shots at him," said
Mrs. Gray, "to scare him, as he had
I twice attempted to break in my door. I
i had no intention of injuring him. I had
not seen him for some weeks till ha
called in a drunken condition early yes
terday morning."
Mrs. Gray's boy, 4 years of age, was
I taken to the City Prison with his mother
and was placed in charge of the matron.
He was run down by a wagon recently
and Is still suffering from the injuries
he then sustained.

A Queer War Incident.
Speaking of these short rushes forward,
a queer thing happened at Guguinto,
where perhaps half of the soldiers in one
regiment found hens. Before there waa
time to kill the fowl orders came to go
forward. A little farther out the regiment
lay down under fire for some minutes.
I Then the order came to charge. Up nnd
i forward with a yell rushed the soldiers,
! but over the cheering rose another sound.
i Three or four hundred hens, objecting to
I being carried head down with feet tied to
j the strap of a haversack, set up a frantic
squawking such as was probably never
heard along a line of charging military
before. â Manila Correspondent in Leslie's

AN INTERESTING LECTURE AT
ST. BRENDAN'S CHURCH.
The First California's Chaplain
Praises Officers and Men in the
Philippines for Their Re
â¢ spect for Religion.
â¢
The Rev. Father McKinnon, chaplain of
the First California Regiment, took occa
sion, in his lecture on "The Churches of
Manila" at St. Brendan's Church last â 
night, to vindicate the American soldiers
of the charge of looting the churches of
the islands, which has indirectly been laid
at their door. - Father McKinnon's lan
guage was positive and his praise of i
American officers and men unstinted. He i
Raid In part:
Aguinaldo and his followers, with thÂ»
oath-bound organization to which they be
long, have no use for religion, and they
have Imprisoned ninny of the pastors of
the churches. It may not be out of place i
to say a word regarding the alleged looting !
â ad sacrilegious ration of the churches i
by our soldiers that we read so much about
in the dally, and especially the religious,
press. That the American soldiers are to
blame for the desecration I most emphati
cally deny. Every precaution was taken
during the campaign. A general order, read
ejght days in succession to every command,
was Issued by General Otis against it. I i
am proud to say every commander did his
best to enforce this.
I was with all the commands. I received .
strict orders to take whatever guard was
needed to protect the churches and was told
that I would be responsible for whatever
ration took place. What more could
a commander do? In most of the towns the !
churches were dismantled before our en- j
trance. In regard to the church at Caloo- i
can. i visited it some months before the ]
battle at that place and found It a veritable
fortress and used as such by the Insurgents.
This church the American shells demolished
to dislodge the Insurgents. The American
army has been unjustly criticized In this I
matter.
Father McKinnon Illustrated his lecture
with stereopticon views from photo
graphs which he took while on the Isl
unds. Th. lecture was full of interest
arid was heard by a crowded house. j
A BIG DAY PARADE
Minnesota Volunteers at the Circus
To-Morrow Night.
It was all cirrus last night. The down
town population was decreased by just
as many as could be crowded into the
seats that the Walter Main show people
have put up under their big tent at Six
teenth and Folsom streets. Th. entertain
ment bore out the promise that was made
on Saturday night in the bis street parade
and initial performance, and, as on the
first night, the Rough Riders and the ring
full of performing norses were the prin
cipal attractions, that will draw another
tentful of spectators to-night. Both the
matinee and the night performance were
the best that the Main troupe is able to
furnish, and both were equally well at
tended.
To-morrow night is to be Minnesota
nUht. Something like 1000 men of the
Minnesota regiment have been provided
with tickets and' will attend In a body. For
Wednesday another big street parade has
been arranged. It will start from the big
tf-nts at 9:30 o'clock in the morning, and
JmJjjing- from the line 'of march that has
been outlined it won't get back there un
til time for the afternoon show. . In that
parade the whole menagerie will partici
pate, every case will be open and every
attraction on exhibition. It will start from
the lot at Sixteenth and Folsom streets,
and will go down to East street, to the
ferry, then up Market to Kearny and out
to Pacific; down Dupont to Market again,
and out to McAllister, and then out L.ar
kin to Post. From Post it will go out
Polk to Jackson, then down Van Ness to
Hayes, then to Ninth and up Mission to
Sixteenth, when it will return to the lot.
It will be the biggest circus parade San
Francisco has ever seen, and with the at
tractions the Mains hold out it will be
well worth seeing.

ANOTHER WEEK OF
UNLIGHTED STREETS
FOR another weok San Francisco's streets at night will preserve the
pitchy blackness that has been their chief characteristic since the gas
company shut off the light? last Friday.
The profound jtloom is more than an irritating inconvenience â it is
a peril. us rat nace to the safety of the city's inhabitants. For six more
nights it will continue, and for six mon- nights belated pedestrians
will blindly start- at poles and fence corners in anxious expectation of meet
ing a lurking: footpad.
The most efficient police force Is powerless to cope with such conditions.
Thorough illumination is accounted by criminal authorities one of the most
potent aids to the arm of the law. However, as the city will not pay the bills
the company will not furnish the gas. Therefore not until the Ist of October
will the gas jets again twinkle cheerfully on the street corners of San Fran
cisco.
other cases are of murder, accident,
drowning and railroad disasters.
On the evening of September 22 William
Carr. a can maker, residing at S4.i Mission
street, and a soldier named William
Flannigan were taken to the city Receiv
ing Hospital in police patrol wagons for
medical treatment. Carr was picked up
on the corner of Sixth and Bryant and
Flannigan was found on the corner of
Fifth and Market streets. Both were un
conscious and died soon after reaching the
hospital. It appears, that no examination
\v:is made by the city doctors as to the
cause of their collapse, the victims having
been treated for alcoholism. When the
Morgue deputies arrived to take posses
sion of the bodies they were given to un
derstand that the agent of death in both
ces was alcohol, and it was so
stated in the death report.
On the following daj an autopsy was
performed on The remains of Carr. The
startling disclosure was then made that
the man had come to his death by a frac
tured skull and not from drink. This fact
was unknown to the hospital authorities.
When the body of Flannigan, who was
a soldier, was taken to the Presidio, it
was found that there were several clots
Of M-iod pressing on his brain and that
one of these had produced death. As in
the case of Carr the hospital physicians
did not know of their presence and calmly
allowed the man to die while they were
treating him for an overindulgence in
alcoholic stimulants. The cases will be
brought to the attention of a Coroner's
lury to-day and Detective Gibson, who
has been making an Investigation for the
police, will give his testimony.
An inquest will be held on the body of
Ixmise Schlegel, the young and unfor
tunat< domestic who was accidentally as
phyxiated by gas. The death of William
Kelly, who " was found in the hay last
week will also be Investigated. The mur
der of William Kennedy. wh.> was shot
by "Tack" Main in a Third-street sali>on,
will be called to the attention of a jury,
as will be the death of John E. Burke,
who was fatally injured In an explosion
on the transport Sherman last Friday
night. The last case is that of G. W. Wil
liams, who died in the Southern Pacific
Railroad Hospital from injuries received
in a railroad wreck in Nevada. He was a
LOtive fireman and was pinned be
neath a mass of wreckage in a collision.

After a Desperate Struggle the In

the Butt End of a
Revolver.
Â«
After slashing Police Officer Geiman
over the right eye last night with a |
razor, "Andy"" Campbell, a colored piano
mover, drew the blade across his own
throat, inflicting a serious wound. De
spite the injury Campbell fought viciously
J against arrest, and the officer found it
, necessary to beat him into submission
with the butt end of his revolver.
Geiman was patrolling his beat on
Grant avenue when his attention was
called to. Campbell, who- was standing in
front of a saloon at 205 Post street, nour
! ishing a razor and threatening to. carve
the first one who interfered with him.
The officer accosted Campbell and en
deavored to coax him to give him the |
razor. Campbell, after threatening to
j send Geimaii to the Morgue if he attempt- ;
I ed to disarm him, backed into the saloon.
. Geiman followed him and again tried to !
! Induce him to give up the razor.
With an oath the desperate colored man
; made a slash at the policeman, cutting
, him over the eye. Quickly drawing his ,
| club, Geiman struck his assailant over
the head several times, forcing him
against the wall.
Just then Campbell drew the keen blade i

Thinking that he was unable to further '
resist arrest, Geiman took out his hand
cuffs, intending to place them on the ne
gro's wrists.
"You ain't got me yet," screamed the
infuriated man, as he sprang at the officer i
and slashed at him with the blood-stained
1 razor. Fortunately Goiman. who is one j
of the most active men In the department,
got out of the way of the razor, and draw
ing his revolver proceeded to beat Camp- <
bell over the head with it.
With the assistance of several bystand
ers the officer finally subdued the mur
derous piano mover. He was then hand
cuffed and removed to the Receiving Hos- .
pital, where the wound In his throat was I
stitched by Drs. Cluness and Hopper.
Getman was also treated at the hospital.
His uniform was cut in several places, |
showing that the razor wielder meant
business.

AN OLD MAN KILLED.
William Phillips Struck by a South
â¢ crn Pacific Train.
William Phillips, a native of Ireland,
aged 55 years, was found dead at 6 o'clock
yesterday morning at the crossing of
Ninth and Division streets. When dis
covered by Thomas Hughes, a special
officer belonging 1 to the Southern Pacific
Company, the body was lying alongside
of the : railway track with both arms
mangled near the shoulders, blood trick
ling from the ears and mouth. From the
position of the body it is evident that the
unfortunate had been struck by a passing
train during the previous night.
Phillips had been a resident of the sec
tion of the city where he was killed for a
number of years. He had been engaged
In looking after an old building- belonging
to Joe Shearer and lived in a portion of
the old shed for years. â¢ â -.":â  â¢-..â¢;

NEW OPERA BY
H. J. STEWART
AT THE GRAND
It is gratifying- to hear that the man
agementfl of the various theaters are be
ginning to give local composer* an oppor
tunity to bo heard. The announcement
that Max Hirschfeld's errand opera would
bo produced at the Tivoli "before the close
of the present season is followed by the
statement that a comic opera by Dr. H.
J. Stewart will be presented at the Grand
Opera House some time next month, and
rehearsals will in all probability begin
this week. The opera is in the Spanish
style of music and the libretto is some
what bouffe. It consists of three acts and
Is said to be very catchy. Dr. Stewart
had an opera performed in this city some
years ago which was quite successful,
it ml no doubt this present work will be
expected with much interest.
Owing to a great demand for seats the
Tivoli management has found Itself
obliged to continue the grand opera season
Indefinitely. This evening "Martha" will
be given, with Thomas Green, the new
tenor, who appeared with the Castle
Square Opera Company last season and
scored quite a success. This lighter opera
will alternate with "Othello." which seems
to have captured the San Francisco pub
lic. An item of intense interest to our lo
cal musicians is the fact that among the
operas in preparation is Verdi's latest
work. "Falstaff," which made a tre
mendous hit in European musical circles.
It is said by many authorities that "Fal
staff" is the grand composer's best work
The concert given by Miss Grace Car*

very successful. The young lady has a

Somo of. the steumers will i;un to Central
American ports and others will majce
monthly trips to the Hawaiian islands.
San Diego or San Francisco will be the
terminal point. The steamers will be run
in connection with the Santa Fe road. The
J. S. Kimball Company of San Francisco
will manage the line. Whether the ter
minal point will be San Diego or San
Francisco has not been decided. Three
steamers are on the stocks for the new
venture. One is ready to launch. The ves
sels will be the finest of their class ever
built on the Pacific Coast. The one near
ly completed is almost 235 feet long. The
speed capacity of all the fleet will be fif
teen knots. Two are building at Grays
Harbor and one is nearly completed at
Puget Sound. General Manager Nevins
of the Santa Fe is in the East, and he
may purchase two fast steamers there to
run between San Diego and Honolulu
alone, connecting with the Kimball line
for San Francisco.
The removal of the lightship from the
bar badly puzzled Captain Lewis of the
James A." Gftrfield, and may prove to be
a serious matter for others. The Gar
field last Wednesday was on its way from
the north with a cargo of lumber for this
port. In the midst of the fog the vessel
got into the breakers off the North Far
allon. Sheering off northeast by east,
Noonday Rock was cleared. After he had
passed the Farallones Captain Lewis
searched for the lightship, but found only
a buoy in its place.

SUNDAY AT THE PARK.
The crowds at the beach and the park
were large yesterday morning, but before
the hour arrived for the bands to play
and the fun in general to bog-In the fog
bank drfven landward by a chilling breeze
caused most of the people to seek, their
home?. A T ery few remained at the park
after the intermission in the musiral pro
gramme, and the beach was likewise de
serted about that hour.
Scorchers at the park pave the police
some trouble yesterday, and the police
reciprocated. J. W. Edmonds, J. A. Tay
lor, H. Berrar. Otto Koch, Frank Holland
p.nd S. J. Thomas were arrested for fast
riding and taken to the station. Each
was' compelled to deposit $20 ball before
his freedom was granted. All managed
' to raise the necessary funds and secured
their release.
As shelter is afforded, the fog did not
drive the crowd from Â«he Chutes, several
thousand people remaining- there during
the entire day. Adgie and the high div
ing act were the features of the day.

BOHE PROVES
A WONDER AT
UNION PARK
Romps Through the Open
Stake, Defeating Imported
Plough Boy.
J. H. Perigo's California-bred greyhound
Bohe, representing the best blood in this
Ftate, fairly romped through the open
Stake "at Union Coursing Park yesterday.
She defeated Sardonic, Metallic by a score
of f'iur points to nothing, Lucky Dog and
Plough Boy. She was favored with two
byes, the first an accidental one through
the withdrawal of Lord Byron, and the
Becond a natural bye. In the course with
Lucky Dog the latter led up, but Bohe
secured possession of the hare and out
worked her opponent.
The final course was a grand one, of
which the spectators saw but little, owing
to a heavy fog which obscured the field.
Bohe led from the slips by over four
lengths. The hare then turned back
toward the slipper's stand, where the dogs
worked it for some time. It then made
fur the escape, Plough Boy in the mean
time having possession of the game. The
spectators cheered both logs as they dis
appeared In the fog, and then stood peer
ing anxiously Into the mist to catch the
lirst glimpse of the flag signaling which
dog had yon. It was only a few moments.
but it seemed an interminable time, until
riag Steward Grlswold came galloping
across the field like one of Roosevelt's
Hough Riders, displaying the red nag de
noting victory for 80l
1' J Reilly's Plough Boy proved himself
a great greyhound. He was unfortunate
in having two undecided courses with Kid
McCoy before lie finally disposed of him.

SACRAMENTO
AND OAKLAND
BREAK EVEN
Harvey Found for Bunches of
Kits â Morning Game
Taken by Senators.
Oakland 8, Sacramento 3.
The baseball game yesterday afternoon
at Recreation grounds resulted in a
victory for Oakland because the Dudes
untwisted Harvey's shoots and curves,
not because of . their general playing.
Seven 'errors of the refulgent order wer.e
committed by the Brummels, but their
stick work was of such brilliancy that
even Cal Ewing has forgotten all about
them. Three two-baggers and a bunch
of singles were all the Dudes did to Har
vey. The crowd, which was about the
largest of the season, was happy In the
extreme.
Umpire William Long was again upon
the scene. He has not improved in the
discernment of a ball from a strike or a
baseball player from a section of Recrea
tion Park air. The spectators helped to
persuade him of this before the game was
finished.
Sacramento took a winning stride at
the beginning of the game. Mclaughlin
found a safe resting place at the first
bag when Schmeer fumbled his hit.
Harvey was given a base on balls and
O'Connor collided with the ball, tilling
all three bags. Eagan hit to Schmoer,
who threw the ball home, thus forcing
and retiring McLaughlin. Hammond.
In an attempt for a double, threw wildly
to first and Harvey scored. In the next
Inning Oakland tied the score by sending
Schmeer across the plate. He earned his
way to first by a hit. went to third on a
hit to center from Moski man's bat. and
scored on Harvey's fumble of a hot ground
ball which Borchers swatted. The score
was thus tied, and so it remained until
the end of the fifth.
Two runs were added to Sacramento
score in the sixth. Harvey went to first
on an error of Dunleavy and Schmeer
allowed O'Conner to emulate Harvey.
Then came Eagan, who punished the ball
for two bases, scoring Harvey and O'Con
nor. In this inning Dunleavy, who made
first on the forcing out of Donovan at
second, scored on Lance's deep center hit
for two bases.
In the seventh the Dudes caught Har
vey on the right spot. Four hits and
four runs were the net products of the
discovery of Harvey's curves. Hutchin
son was sent to first and scored immedi
ately after on Hammond's two-base hit.
Hardie whacked the ball out to center
and Hammond scored. Then came Dono
van for a single and 1 unleavy for a
double, which meant the scoring of Hardie
and Donovan, to the great chagrin of
Sacramento's pride. In the following
inning four more hits were worked off
Harvey, but this time they netted but
two runs, made by Borchera and Hutch
inson. t<
Borchers pitched a remarkably good
game, striking six men out and allowing
but four hits. The prettiest fielding work j
of the day was a sensational stop by
Schmeer, putting one runner out at sec
ond and doubling the man going to first.

MORNING GAME.
Sacramento 3, Oakland 1.
At no time during the morning game at
Oakland were the dress suit case-packers
of. Broadway in the running. For seven
innings the wise politicians of the capital
city, led by Doyle, held them off the
bases, and they did not get a single tally.
in the eighth Lange crossed the plate for
the Dudes, but as Sacramento was jubi
lant in the contemplation of three runs
before this" period the sole successful ef
fort of Oakland did not shatter the gla
cier.
The run made by Lange in the inning
before the last was due to a succession of
hits which the Dudes made in one, two,
three fashion. This was the only time
Doyle of Sacramento was found, and three
singles were made off his delivery. Stef
fanl pitched a good game also. The Sac
ramentans played in championship form,
all but the stick work, and that was not
up to their usual standard. â¢ The score:

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL,, MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 25. 1899.
DANCED AND MADE MERRY AT THE
BUTCHERS' OUTING AND BARBECUE
Striking Features of the Benevolent Butchers' Picnic.
ACCORDING to one of the "swagger" set, the last hop
of the picnic season given in Sunset Park. Santa
Cruz Mountains, yesterday, was strictly au fait.
The occasion for the outpouring of southside soci
ety was the annual outing and barbecue of the Journey
men Butchers' Protective and Benevolent Association.
That it was a genuine success will be attested by nearly
a thousand merry-makers who participated in the day's
pleasures. Only one tight marred the festivities, but this
was so speedily fjuel'.ed by alert deputy sheriffs that few
dii the grounds were aware of it. One of the participators
in the brawl afterward admitted to his friends that a
"guy" tried to steal his girl and he simply emphasized
his right to monopolize her dance programme by "hand
ing" him one.
The barbecue proved a taking feature of the picnic.
Jovial Ben Davis, the lord high chef, and his humble as
sistants, F. C. Dana. Charles Rosenberg, Joe Williams
and "Harry" Bar, were on the scene the night before,
and whin the two sections of passenger cars rolled into
the picnic grounds at noon everything was in readiness for
the guests. Choice ribs and loins of beef had been prop
erly broiled, and pitchforks were used to remove the ap
petizing meat from the novel oven to the tables, to be

GOOD ENTRY LIST.
Louisville Driving and Fair Associa
tion Promise Good Sport.
LOUISVILLE. Sept. 24.â A1l entries are
completed for the fifth meeting of the
Louisville Driving and Fair Association,
which begins Monday and continues ar
week. There are four races each day,
and during the meeting $40,000 in purses
will be distributed. All of the crack trot
ters and pacers which have gone on the
grand circuit are now here. The principal
events of the meeting are the Kentucky
Matron stake, $7000, for three-year-old
trotters, in which there are seventeen en
tri.s; the 2:08 pace, for J2OOO, in which
Sally Toler (2:O6Vi). Indiana (2:07%), Hal
B (2:04Â»4), Lady of the Manor (2:04 1 4Â», Ar
lington (2:07) and Nieol B (2:08^) are en
tered. These two events are down for the
first day.
The Douglass stake, on Tuesday, for
i carved into sandwiches and dispensed to all who would
partake. The meat was so tempting that everybody ate
heartily, and the men in charge of the counter were kept
busy all the afternoon nerving the crowd.
Then was not a lull in the dancing. Throughout the
afternoon the waxed floor of the spacious pavilion was
crowded with devotees of the light fantastic, who glided,
bopped and pirouetted to such soulful and exhilarating
melodies as "She Is More to Be Pitied Than Chlded,"
"How I Like to See My Poor Old Father Work." "When
Dewey Comes Marching Home" and other popular songs.
R. C. Dunbar, who acted as floor manager, was given that
distinguished honor because he was the only member of
the association who was a member of the California vol
unteers. He was ably assisted by Frank Krauer, H. F.
Schwab, Ben Osswald, Morris Marks. Arthur O'Reilly
and J. J. Shepston. All the ladles were attired in light
outing dresses, which contrasted very nicely with the
vari-colored shirts of the men, who, mindful of their own
comfort, discarded their coats and vests.
At 5 o'clock the picnickers left the beautiful grounds,
and another pleasant event had passed into the memory
of those who attended.
Jf/tOfl. for 2:12 trotters, oligitile May &, is

ON THE CRICKET FIELD.
Alamedas Defeat Pacifies in a Closely
Fought Match on the Home
Grounds.
The Alameda cricket team scored an
other victory yesterday over its old
rivals, the Pacifies. Captain George
Theohald of the Pacifies won the toss and
took the field. Though there was no
heavy batting on the Alameda side, six
of the batsmen made double figures, the
highest scorers being J. H. Saunders and
V. E. Seebeck, each of whom compiled
22 runs. Of the Pacific bowlers Coles
proved the most effective, taking 5
wickets for 26 runs; Casidy took 3 for 30
and Harbour 1 for 34.
The Pacifies were without the services
of one of their best batsmen, J. Myers,
but with 44 runs for 2 wickets down their
chances of victory looked by no means
bad. When 7 wickets had fallen for 79
runs the prospects of winning looked
slender. The last three wickets raised the
total to 107, and tnus the match ended in
a win for the Alamedas by 15 runs. The
Alamedas tried six bowlers, of whom
Fortmann took 3 wickets for 16 runs, Mc-
Ix-an 3 for 22 and Ward Jr. 2 for 26. The
highest scorers ior the losers were George
Theobald 20 and H. P. G. Gordon 18. In
the Pacific team there were three Theo
balds, George, his brother John and his
son Bert. The full details of the game

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway. Sept. 24.
In some respects the programme at the
City Hall is very like the circus; In other
respects there is a big difference. Some
of the specialties could not be duplicated
In any three-ring show on earth, but Li
cense Collector Maloon would not have
the same difficulty in assessing the muni
cipal circus that he experienced in as
sessing the other aggregation now on the
coast. Mr. Maloon was doubtful as to
whether to charge the circus for two per
formances a day or one, and the circus
people, to help him out, announced that
they would be open from noon till mid
night. This obviated the matter and
made it plain that there was at least one
break daily in the performance, which
made it legal for the collector to demand
one license fee each day. Should he have
the duty of taxing the municipal circus

ne would not nna it very prontaDie, as ne
would only be entitled to one fee each
year, the continuous performance at the
City Hall never being broken.
The past week has produced more than
Us share of paper-ring aerial jumps. Mr.
Miller, whose path is a thorny one at
lost, performed the trick of jumping
through a beautifully veiled ring held up
by Mr. Schaffer and apparently landing
oh his feet.
Ringmaster Snow cracked his whip and
became so excited that he offered to bet
his boots that he could do something that
is not now being done, to wit. carry out
a $100 job with less than $30 worth of in
spection. Mr. Dow signalized his return
from his holiday by turning two or three
somersaults and informing his chief that
many things transpired at the City Hall
circus that should cause people to blush
for shame. v >.'
Somehow the clown in the council
chamber did not make his appearance, and
the show was very serious, for a time ap
pearing as though there might be need
for a few police officers; but after all it
was only a jokeâ one of the six months
of jokes that have been played since April
âand by this time it Is all forgotten.
The politicians are in grave danger.
The county has had forced upon it some
things of interest that are likely to in
terfere with the vanity of the job-chaser.
From Tesla to West Oakland everybody
is busy except the county's prisoners and
the willfully lazy. There is not, by 25 per
cent, enough labor in the county at this
time to do its work, whether in the can
nery or in the building of new houses and
business blocks. The newspapers have
taken on an encouraging tone and enjoy
the supreme satisfaction of . publishing
daily columns of information relating to
the scores of new homes and commercial
buildings that are being erected; the new
contracts for wharf building and for
warehouses that are being recorded; the
reports of the fruit growers, canners and
dryers that show how good prices have

been paid and how the county could have
found a market for much more fruit than
reduced, and while all these thing's
engrossing public attention, very
little notici la being taken of the poli
tician. Even the weekly letters on
politics thai find their way into print ap
pear Stale, flat and unprofitable alongside
the pictures and figures that are proof of
better times than the county has iknown
for ten years.
Anomalous as it may seem, the failure
to carry out many existing contracts Is
due tn good times, the contractors not be
ing able to procure enough lumber or
Steel to fulfill their promises. All this
has had its effect on the public mind, and
then Is a general desire to do something.
Oaklanders realize, that they have been
backward about twenty years too long,
and that although it is rather late to
wake it is h.tier to be aroused at this
time than t/> sleep on to death. In every
quarter ot the city opinion is favorable
toward the obtaining of great public im
jinvements by the issuing of bonds. For
the pa.st five years bonds have been
talked of at regular intervals, but the ac
tual poverty existing made a reasonable
foundation for opposing any such large
expenditures. Now It Is different and
civic pride appears to be asserting itself.
A study of the city charter shows that
it is not the faulty law that many le-
NEWS
of the Bay Cities
lieve It to be. Until absolutely spoiled fix
years ago by the hasty and ill-advised
action of those responsible for its amend
ment, the charter worked admirably.
Now It is as bad in its operation as it is
possible for it to be. A few days ago
City Attorney Dow. who has been in office
for five years, and who is a member of
the Board of Works, stated that the
present constitution of the .joard
Is an absolute failure. Considering
that Mr. Dow's political friends were
Bolely responsible for the manner
in which the board is now consti
tuted, the working of the charter must
be very had indeed when Mr. Dow will
thus strongly criticize the result of their
work. Judge Stanly, one of the most
level-headea jurists of California, who is
this day being consigned to his grave, was
not actuated by petty politics when he
gave the best efforts of his mind to the
formation of the present charter. As he
left it, It was good, and while the city was
governed under it there was none of the
stupidity and puerile fighting between the
Council and the Board of Works that
now exists, and which is as repugnant
to an intelligent public as it is disgraceful
to those fostering it, but who are only
responsible secondarily for BUCb condi
tions, the chief odium being with those
who made such conditions possible.
With a reconstructed Board of Works
the charter will give satisfaction, pro
vided it also makes some provision for
fixing an annual tux levy that shall pro
vide an Income necessary for a progres
sive administration and which shall not
be dependent upon the political whims of
County Assessors
Adna A. Dennison, the city editor of a
local paper, should have trouble enough
on his bands hereafter. He has given to
the world suggestions as to how to write
to and for newspapers. In his opening
paragraph he says: "In these days when
every citizen considers that he has an
inalienable right to write for the news
papers, and not only communications on
"DOMINIE" DhNNIf-ON'S HfcAVEN.
various topics, but matters of news are
contributed by persons not regularly at
tached to the staff, it ought to be a part
of the education of even' mdiv dual to
know how to properly prepare and ad
dress a communication to a newspaper.
It is one of the essential things which is
omitted from public school courses."
The rest of Mr. Dennison's article sets
forth in detail how to write, what to
write, whom to send to, and what to tell
the editor. Mr. Dennlson evidently takes
great pleasure in encouraging "every
citizen" to exercise hie "inalienable
right," and so that he may not be dis
couraged I would advise that the 70/KX)
citizens of Oakland exercise their right
by sending a sample communication on
any old thing to Mr. Dennison. His ad
dress is Adna A. Dennison, city editor,

A few weeks ago a celebrated San Fran

The retiring members are Tom Wells of
Murray Township, Charles Ro.-th and
John Mitchell of Oakland. T'nless some
thing unforeseen happens, it is hardly
likely that another Democrat will suc
ceed Mr. Wells. Thre.- years ago there
was a bitter factional fight between the
Republicans of Murray and Washington
Township, which was carried beyond the
convention to the polls and the W;ushing
ton Republicans voted with the Demo
erats. electing Wells. Now party lines
are better harmonized, and it is- believed
that a Washington man will win the Re
publican nomination, especially as Mur
ray has received several appointments in
the county government during the past
two years. Ex-Supervisor Hiram Bailey
and Assemblyman William McDonald are
already laying wires, and there are about
a dozen others.
In Oakland John Mitchell and Charles
Roeth will have no walk-over, although
each is anxiotis to succeed himself.
Mitchell has been guilty of the great po
litical mistake of not standing steadily
by any one faction. He has passed the
hat around and has landed where he
cannot with any great claim demand the
support of any particular element in his
party. Unlike Church and his class of
politicians who always stand by their
friends through thick and thin and come
up smiling after the election, Mitchell
has temporized and at times tins at
tempted to carry water on both shoulders
until he has become a much weaker man
toward the end of his term than he was
at the beginning.
Dr. Pierce, the veterinary surgeon, and
W. S. Wixson of North Oakland would
like to be Supervisors and already they
are marshaling their friends in their be
half. There are half a dozen other candi
dates anxious to step into Mr. Mitchell's
shoes.
Charles Roeth has been cleverly repair
ing his broken ferces during the past few
months, and has regained some of the
ground he hae" lost a year ago. But there
are many anxious for his scalp and it is
already evidenced that he will have no
easy task to succeed himself.

SCHMIDT DREW A GUN.
Fruitvale Man Runs His Fath-?r-in-
Law Into the Street.
OAKLAND, Sept. 24.â The bitter feeling
existing for some time between Henry
Miner, residing in the Allendale Tract at
Fruitvale, and his son-in-law, J. G.
Schmidt, reached its climax to-night Ah
a result the son-in-law was arrested by
Deputy Sheriff Qulnlan on a charge of
assault with a deadly weapon.
Schmidt and his wife have been sepa
rated for some time. This evening he
called on her at the home of her father,
Mr. Miner, when the latter, so Schmidt
claims, accused him of having purloined
a watch. After a heated argument
Schmidt is said to have whipped out a re
volver, fully loaded, and threatened to
shoot off the top of his father-in-law's
head. Miner rushed from his home and
sought protection at the hands of Deputy
Sheriff Quinlan. Schmidt showed tight
when the officer attempted to place him
under arrest. A desperate struggle fol
lowed, but the officer proved quite equal
to the occasion, felling his man and haul
-Ins him to the County Jail.

Electric Car Wrecks a Buggy.
OAKLAND, Sept. 24.â A San Pablo ave
nue electric car crashed into a horse and
buggy to-night at Fourth street and
Broadway, demolishing the rig and injur
ing the horse so severely that it will have
to be shot. The driver, Harry Wells, aped
24 years, residing on Hancock street, as
poon as he realized what had happened,
ran away, leaving the wreck for others to
attend. The horse and busgy are the
property of Thomas McKenzie, a livery
man at Thirteenth and Center streets,
who says Wells ordered the rig by tele
phone this morning, representing himself
as Williams, a produce merchant.

DUNGEONS USUALLY
BREED SKEPTICISM
Rev. William Rader of the Third Con
gregational Church delivered a sermon
last nigtit on "From Desert tv Dungeon."
In part he said:
John was a sensational preacher. He was
original In dress, being clothed with sklna;
original In what he ate and what he said. To
httn belongs the honor of presenting Jesus to
the world and of baptizing 'him In the Jordan, j
This was a greater honor than writing an j
epic or smashing a fleet. He came in contact '
with Herod, whose domestic life he attacked. !
The rustic preacher retained the iron of his ;
logic and the strength of his purpose before
the throne. The voluptuous life ot the court j
did not injure him. But he was cast Into I
prison.
The open air has done much for faith. It
Is easier to believe under God's great sky
than In a dungeon. Dungeons usually breed
Bkepticlsm. They crush courage. John the
Baptist doubted and he sent to Christ for a
vindication of his faith. The answer was that
people were being healed and helped and
saved.
Civilization, good laws, good lives, good,
charity, virtue and benevolence is the bp*t
answer to the appeal fr"m the dungeons.
Great lives are better than pood books.

and bits of personal experience, which add

His sermon in the morning was on the
"Keynote of Victory." and was taken
from the text, "Have Faith in God. He
explained the wonderful power of faith,
the prayer of which was always answered
by divine Providence, and that it was by
faith more than by words and works that
victory over the evil one was achieved.
His subject In the evening related to the
necessity of tho co-operation of the indi
vidual in bringing souls to the kingdom
of God, which was the true mission of the
church.
"This mission can be successful in va
rious ways," he said. "One of these is to
go to men with love in our hearts and talk
to them about their souls. Men could be
brought to salvation by earnest personal
effort, by our living a blameless life,
whereby they would be convinced that
there Is reality in the Christian religion.
Again, a life of Christian Joy is a splendid
way to reach lost souls.
"T do not believe in long-faced Chris
tianity," concluded Dr. Bane. "It is sinful
for a Christian to be gloomy. He ought
to be happy, both in his life and in his
testimony. Live a life of self-sacrifice, of
tenderness and love, and many will be en
couraged to come into the kingdom of
God."

FATHER WYMAN SPEAKS
ON OUR LADY OF MERCY
At St. Mary's Church last evening
Father Wyman preached on the . feast
celebrated yesterday by the Catholic
churchâ that of Our Lady of Mercy. He
said:
The blessed virgin Is distinguished more
by the attribute of mercy than by any
other. There is no title by which Chris
i tians delight to address her more than
- that of "Mother of Mercy." She was
raised up by the Almighty to be the In
strument of mercy to all mankind. God
has never made or formed but one enmity
; and that is an Irreconci liable one. It is
that which exists between Mary, his
worthy mother, and Satan. In all the con
flicts between Satan and mankind the
blessed virgin has been the one who in
accordance with the prophecy of man's
redemption, has crushed the head of the
serpent.
. â¦ .
"So your father said he must prov*
his love before he can marry you. Hn\t
does he expect him to prove it?" "By
figures, I imagine." â Brooklyn Life.

easier It is to lose it.
A woman may be a poor marksman,
but she generally knows how to throw a
hint.
The young man with the money to

PLANS FOR THE
FORMATION OF A
GREAT LIBRARY
â¦
Union of Mechanics
and Mercantile.
Â»
A MUCH-TALKED-OF SCHEME!
â¦
PROBABLY PERMANENT CLOS- ,
ING OF THE FAIR
It Has Not Been ProfitableâPropo
sition to Sell the Real Estate
and Reorganize the Insti
tution.
*-,
There will be a peerless library in San
Francisco before a year is out if the
plans now being talked of among the
members of the Mechanics' Institute and
the Mercantile Library be carried to a j
satisfactory conclusion. A union of the
two Institutions is sought by many of the -
members of both, and the idea is gaining
in favor the more it cornea under dlscus
eion. It takes prominence too from the
fact that the Mechanics' Library is in a
state of transition, and it will not be long
before there is a definite change in its
financial policy. For years It has been
looked upon by a great portion of its ,
membership as a money making institu
tion, but it has come to be believed that i
to keep abreast of the times the institu- :
tion must devote more to the library
itself and less to the holding of property j
and the giving of fairs, and so it may be
that the- exposition now in progress at the
old pavilion will be the last the people of j
this city can attend in a long time.
The plan of uniting the two libraries has â 
been spoken of among the members for
some months, but there has been no defi
nite action taken by any one in authority.
It has become too important a subject to
be passed without notice, however, and
already the idea of calling a conference
between the officers of the two libraries is
taking shape. It is expected this meeting
will take place soon after the closing of
the fair, and the advocates of the scheme \
are sure the conference can end in but ;
one way â a union of the two and the
formation of the biggest and finest sub
scription library in the United States.
For months past the finances of the
Mercantile Library have been in a most
unquiet condition. There is a mortgage !
of JTo.iOO on the property on the corner of
Golden Gate and Van Ness avenues, and.
It takes all thÂ»; income from the dues and :
the rental of the building to pay the in- j
terest on this and to keep the Institution :
going. It has not been progressing in any
way and a corporation of that kind can
not remain stationary. The library must
be maintained up to date, and the prop
erty kept in repair, and the income of the
institution is nardly sufficient to do all
this. Something must be done, and tne
members have been looking around for
some way out of the difficulty. Various
means have been resorted to. but they
have either failed or have been laid aside,
and now the last step is being urged.
Either the .Mercantile must consolidate
with the Mechanics', or it cannot hope to '
run much i<Â«iiUtr on the basis that at
present exists. i
There has never been any doubt of the ;
excellence of the Mercantile Library. It
has elotfe to sixty thousand volumes, ln
ciuding a reference library that could
hardly be equaled. It would be a real ad
cition to tne Mechanics' Institute, for it
has upon its shelves thousands of volumes
not to be found in '::â¢â¢ Mechanics' Library
nor anywhere else, it would be a sham*
to scatter the collection, and there is no'
one here whose literary tastes and whose
pocket-book are bo thoroughly in accord i
as to enaule him to purchase the library ;
in its entirety. As a consequence, the
idea of consolidation is looked upon with j
the greatest favor oy the members of the !
Mechanics' and particularly by those
who are members of both institutions.
There are me hundreds of these, and :
among them are the warmest supporters
of the plan. There is need of change in
the downtown institution as well as in
the other, and the union with the Mer
cantile is looked upon as a good start to
ward greater prosperity. '
Ine auoiiuoa vi tile fair is another
matter receiving the attention of the dis- ;
cursive, for i..c exposition has not been
paying much In late years* and this season
it looks as if there would be a heavy
deficit to face at the close of the exmoi
tion. The exposition has not been able to
pay without the methods of the experi
enced showmen, anu the officers of the in
stitute declare they are not showmen
and if the exposition cannot be made to
pay otherwise it la better to stop the an
â¢ nual enterprise.
There is more in contemplation than
this, however, for with the closing for
good of the fair the property must be
sold, and as soon as the Larkin-Btreet
property Is disposed of the Institute will
make other changes that have been
aiscussed for some i,me. it is proposed
to move from the present location on
Post street and establish the library on
some downtown corner, selling tne old
â  place and if possible the property on
Folsom and Sixteenth streets.
. There has always been opposition to tne
selling of any of the property of the in
stitution, ana to prevent any such course
a resolution was passed a year or so ago
-forbidding the sale of any real property
by the board of directors. Conditions
have changed nee then, however, and it
Would not now be a difficult matter to se
cure the consent of a majority of : the
members for such a sale, and if the fairs
are stopped a sale of the property must
follow.
It is figured that from the sale of the
Post street realty and the Larkln street
property enough could be realized to pur
chase a new site in some favorable loca
tion, erect a suitable building and leave
on hand a capital of nearly $400,000 with
which to run th.- library. This might be
made to yield an income of $20,000 a year,
a sum sufficient, with the other sources of
income, to keep the institution in com
parative plenty.
Should the consolidation scheme go
through the result would be a library of
over 100,000 volumes, and one of almost
inestimable value. The merging of the
two memberships would make a strong
following, and the influence of the insti
tution would be more than doubled in
stead of. as now. being divided.
The matter will be decided one way or
the other soon after the fair closes. As
yet the heads of the two institutions will
not discuss the subject officially, but mere
is no active opposition to the plan, and
there is every Indication that it will be
carried to a successful conclusion.
TRIUMPHANT PROGRESS
OF CHRISTIANITY
Rev. E. Nelander of the First English
Lutheran Church delivered a sermon last
night on "The Triumphant Progress of
Christianity." In part he said:
Â£v*At the beginning of this century the esti
mated population of the world was placed
at 1,000,000.000. To-day it is put at M 40.000
-.-000. Then the estimated number of Chris
tian adherents was 200.000,000. Mow it is
â¢477,000.000. During the century the per cent
Increase in population has been about 44.
The per cent increase In the number of
Christian* for the same period has been
more than 135. In the year 1800 there were
about 141.000,000 under Christian government.
Since then the number has been constantly
Increasing until to-day it â  has reached
891,000,000. There are a million and a half
of converts to itaOW for this century of work
among the heathen. Since we gathered here
last Sabbath 2000 souls, at the lowest esti
mate, have been brought into the light of
Christianity, and that among Pagan nations
only. And who shall lift the veil of the
next century?

thing 'clear: Everything is going right. Let

MORE MONTANA
MEN ARRIVE ON
THE VALENCIA
Sunday Reception on
the Bay.
â Â«
EASY VOYAGE FROM MANILA
SICK LIST SMALLER THAN AT
THE START.
Governor of the Mountain State, His
Staff and Many Ladies Extend
a Hearty Welcome to
Their Volunteers.
The transport Valencia arrived in port
yesterday morning, bringing from Manila j
several companies of the First Montana j
Volunteers and members of various other !
regiments. The Montanans predominated,]
and furnished another day of rejoic
ing for the reception committee from their
State. So early did the transport arrive
that the reception committee was taken
by surprise, but the members soon were
afloat In two steamers, and the eitiz' -
reception committee of San Francisco j
soon appeared in another gayly decorated
steamer to add the cordial welcome of a
sister State.
There were 437 Montana officers and sol
diers on the Valencia fresh from the Phil
ippines. Of these twenty-six were in
valids, who were- in various stages of con
valescence. The 400 and odd other war
riors were decidedly able-bodied, tanned
the color of leather, keyed up to the pitch
of Bhoutiog whenever and wherever they
sajv a Montana face beaming fondly upon |
them from a steamer's deck; whenever
and wherever they saw a Montana hand
extended to them in welcome.
They shunted, cheered, iaughed and
half-cried, and the commit tie of recep- I
lion from the Mountain State way equally
affected. The lirst Installment of the re
ceiving Montanans boarded the customs j
steamer Golden Gate at Meiggs wharf and
put out into the stream when the Valen
cia, having been inspected and about to
slip from tier anchorage, was directly off
the wharf. On the Golden Gate were Sen
ator < arter, ex-Governor Rickards, D. E.
Calkins, the former adjutant of the regi
ment; N. B. Holier, William B. Thomp
son ex-Mayor of Butte, and Mrs. Ste
phens, mother of Serjeant Stephens; Mrs.
Keown, wife o'l Major Keown, and a few
San Franciscans.
The Valencia was under way before the
: Gate was fairly turned. So there
was a stern chase', but the Golden Gate
soon overhauled the transport and threw
out lines and a gangplank, and a reunion
of Montana soldiers and their friends fol
io w( < i .
Hardly had the Valencia dropped an
chor when the second detachment of the
reception committee arrived on the Gov
ernor Markham. The central group there
was made up of Governor Smith of Mon
tana and staff.
"What's the matter with Governor
Smith?" shouted the Boldiers as they saw
the ( rovernor.
"He's all rfcin, you bet."
With the Governor was Mrs. Smith, Ad
iutant General English. Colonels Firch.
McTeague and J. T. Stanford. Mr. Thomp
son, a son of the Mayor of Butte. and
Miss Thompson, the Mayor's sister. Their
steamer was fastened to the Golden Gat<
and then all the Montana reception com
mittee- hastened to get aboard of the
transport. The Markham brought off a
.'Undle of copies of the Sunday odi
;' the San Francisco Call for pre
sentation to the soldiers, and they were
eagerly and gladly receiv< d.
The citizens' reception committee ar
rive.i on the Irwin with the band playing.
Once the Irwin circled around the Valen
cia and th<n drew up besidi the Mark
ham, and the four steamers were fastened
together. The enthusiasm of the Montana
soldiers had constantly increased. They
cheered f-aoh steamer with a will and all
the people afloat. Th< y cheered when
they heard that the Montana reception
committee hail prepared a lunch for them
and had brought it to the ship. They
cheered still more wh> n they learned that
the- sum of $40,000 had been raised to give
them a great reception al Butte.
The proceedings did not lack the usual
shading of emotion. Captain Jenson of
Montana waa a picture for a painter, with
his Infant daughter in his arms. / Mrs.
Smith, wife of the Governor, welcomed the
soldiers. The sick soldiers were visited and
cheered up with the sight of their friends.
After the welcomes had all heen extended
the committees came ashore and tried to
arrange for the landing of th<-> BOldiers ;it
once. This could not be arranged, but
the Montanans will come ashore this
morning. They will have an escort to the
Presidio, and their own band will play.
They will probably pass up Market street
before noon, under the command of Major
J. K. Miller.
So far no camp regulations have been
established for the Montana men. but
they will be governed as the other volun
teer regiments have (teen governed â as
much liberty for men and officers as is
consistent with the amount of work to be
done. The work of mustering out the
regiment will commence in earnest to
morrow, and the usual three weeks will
para before it can be finished.
Pay from the beginning of July i.^ due
the rncn. but It has not yet been settled
whether there will be a payday before
the muster out. It may be that the men
will prefer to draw all the money pos
sible at the !nst. and in that case they
will have to do as lx --n they ran on wh.lt
they have now, for the Montana men
stopped In Japan and they brought but
little money away with them.

THE SAN FKAXCISCO CALL, MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 25. 139f1.
BROTHER OF PRESIDENT
McKINLEY IN THE CITY
ABNER MeKINLEY, brother of the President, arrived in the city yes
terday morning and Is now at the Palace. He came from New York,
staying- a day en route at Chicago, Omaha, Salt Lake and Denver, and '
â¢will leave Tuesday evening for the southern part of the State to visit <
Loa Angeles and Coronado. With him are his wife and daughter and the .
balance of the party consists of Major R. C. Smith and William Endsley of <
Philadelphia and Colonel William H. Brown of New York. ,
Yesterday Mr. McKinley was taken in charge by his nephew, George
E. Morse, clerk of the United States District Court, and after spending the *
afternoon in driving about the city was entertained by him at dinner. '
Mr. McKinley, who bears a striking resemblance to his famous brother, <
was seen yesterday, but absolutely refused to say anything of a political na- .
ture for publication.
"I am no politician," said he. "All my time Js taken up with my law prac- '
tice In New York and I have no leisure to devote to anything demanding '
so much attention as politics. This is the tlrst visit I have made to the coast <
since 73, when I came out here to visit my brothers. James and David, who ,
are now dead, but who were then engaged in business hen-. I find the city not (
only greatly changed, but wonderfully Improved as well, and when I look
about me 1 can easily understand the reason the people of San Francisco <
take so much pride in their home. .
I will remain here until Tuesday evening, when I leave for Coronado and <
Los Angeles, where I will spend a few days and then return to this city,
leaving almost Immediately for my home, via Portland and the northern '
route. 1 was obliged to attend to some private Business matters of my own <
in the West and so took the opportunity thus afforded to get a little rest Â«
and visit my relatives on the coast.
While here Mr. McKinley will attend the burial of his nephew. Joseph
Morse, the young lieutenant of the Ninth Infantry, who died of typhoid
fever in Manila, and whose body was shipped home to his parents at 1578 Fell '
street, from which place the funeral will take place next Tuesday. Â«

The Twenty-Sixth Leaves.
The Twenty-sixth Regiment will get
away to-day on the Grant. It was not
expected the command would spend so
little time at the Presidio, but the misfor- j
tunes of the Thirty-first has hastened its
departure.
The Grant came over from quarantine
Saturday night and anchored off the
Government dock. She was berthed yes
terday. This morning the first of the reg
iment's baggage will be put aboard and
before night it is hoped the transport will
be ready for sea.
All the baggage of the Thirty-first Reg
imi nt which was aboard wjis put off ;it
the detention camp on the island, the men i
r>f the regiment acting as stevedores and,
what was better, receiving stevedore*' j
pay for the work. The men worked with
a will and the transport was discharged
in the shortest possible time. Then the!
vessel was fumigated.

ARRIVES IN PORT LEAKING
HER CABGO OF HORSES LEFT
AT HONOLULU.
Detailed Story of the Accident as It
Was Told by Captain Storrs,
Commander of the
Transport.
â¦
The United States transport Leelanaw,
that arrived yesterday from Honolulu,
narrowly escaped total wreck Saturday
on a reef south of Montara. She came
into port leaking and at once transferred
the cargo in her hold to the transport
Rio Janeiro, preparatory to going upon
the drydock for inspection and repairs.
She was ashore several hours on the
rocks, not far from a point where several
vessels have been totally wrecked. The
sea was luckily smooth and only a small
swell was stirring from the time she
struck to the time when she was worked
off into deep water. She is not badly in
jured. Yesterday as she lay beside the
Rio, shifting her cargo, she was able to
keep out the water with her donkey
pump. The story of the wreck is told by
Captain Storrs, who commands the .Lee
lanaw.
"The vessel grounded on a reef to the
south of Montara," he said, "about six
teen miles from the bar, during a fog so
thick that 1 could not sue the lookout. We
sailed from Honolulu September U and
had fine weather until the 20th. I was un
able to get a perfect observation on the
21st and got none on the 22d or 23d and
was compelled to run by reckoning. On
the 23d there was dense fog with clearing
intervals, but no chance for an observa
tion. By reckoning 1 ought to have been
at the South Farallon at 1 p. m. on the
23d. I had the patent lead going every
half hour from 11:30 a. m. to 12:30 p. m.
From then on the lead was going every
lifteen minutes until we got bottom in
86 fathoms at M:4.'> p. m. Then, after we
got the bottom, the lead was kept going
as fast as it could be worked.
"1 heard a fog whistle at 4:40 p. m.,
which was on the port bow. The patent
log was hauled in, and 1 found that one
blade of the rotator was missing. The
blasts of the, fog signal were very irregu
lar. I could' not make the intervals be
tween the blasts agree. At 4:45 o'clock
the lead showed thirty-five fathoms. We
slowed down to a dead slow to identify
the signal, the sound of which was indis
tinct and faint. The first officer, at 5:02
o'clock, showed ten fathoms. Before the
headway of the vessel could be checked
she grounded lightly on the reef.
"The soundings that were then taken
all around the ship showed nothing less
than 14 feet at the bow forward, deep
ening' quickly after passing one-third of
the length from forward. There were nine
fathoms under the stern. I gave orders to
j>ump out No. 1 ballast tank and to 11 11
Nos. 3 and 4, which were empty. The en
gines were all the time backing strongly,
out the tide was falling and we could noL
move her. The engines were slowed just
to hold her from going further on with
the small swell that was running. Every
thing was made ready to try again after
the tide made. Until 11:*) the snip rested
easy and then slewed around about four
points. I put the helm over to port and
ordered full speed astern. After roiling
and thumping several times she came off
in deep water. The water was coming
in the No. 1 ballast tank, but there was
no trouble in keeping it, free. We came
up off the bar. but couldn't find the light
snip, because it had been removed for re
palrs."
The reasons that Captain Storrs gives
for the accident are: "Lack of opportuni
ty fur observations to verify my position;
losing a blade off the rotator of the pat
ent !ng. which altered its rate and thereby
fouled my dead reckoning; running with
the wind and sea abeam for three days
set the ship further to the southeast than
1 allowed for."
The Leelanaw sailed from San Fran
cisco September 1 for Manila via Hono
lulu. She had <m board a cargo of horses
and a large amouni of commissary stores,
principally canned goods. On the trip
down to flonoiulu five horses died. When
the steamer reached Honolulu the horses
were put ashore for their health. There
they very soon developed a disease that
became epidemic and it was impracticable
tn take them on board again to continue
the voyage to Manila. Captain Storrs
consequently started back for San Fran
cisco, bringing the commissary stores
with him. How near the vessel came to a
shipwreck has already been told.
The disease that the horses developed is
unknown. People who have some knowl
edge of horses in Honolulu hazarded the
opinion that it was what is known as the
"DOO hoo" fever, a painful but not neces
sarily dangerous malady.
An* investigation of the accident to the ,
Leelanaw will be made probably this
week.
MEN ORDERED TO STRIKE.
Boilermakers Decide to Take the Long
Threatened Action.
The boilermakcrs" strike la on. A meet-
Ing of the men hold yesterday afternoon at
A. o. F. hall, 10" O'Farrell street. James
Ryan presiding, and after discussing the i
situation decided to Issue orders that all
boilermakers working f n r firms doing
work on United States-- army transports
Stay out until the ei^ht-hour system is
acknowledged. It was also decided that I
any boilennaker who works on any j
transport until the eight-hour rule is [
adopted will be declared a "scab" for ;
life.
Chairman Ryan announced that the ;
meeting had been called for the purpose
of taking action on the recent orders of
the Pulton and Risdon Iron Works, which
Insisted that nine hours' work and ten j
hours' pay should constitute a day's work
on all contracts on United States trans
ports.
The boilermakers in the Fulton and the
Risdon shops, it was stated, are working
now inside ten hours at 32V,. cents per j
hour, while on outside jobs they work
nine hours for ten hours' pay. but they
refuse to work on transport contracts at
that rate, demanding $3 25 for a day's j
work of eight hours. These shops paid i
their men $;{ 25 for eight hours' work for
only one week, then insisting on the old :
rate, to which the boilermakers would not
agrees
The men claim that Captain Barneson,
superintendent of the transport, service,
had agreed with them that on transport
contracts eight hours would be considered
a day's work, and hail so declared him
self to a committee of boilermakers. The
EliSdon people insist that the committee |
had misunderstood ih< captain's meaning,
an'. 1 , acting on the suggestion of the com- [
mittee. the captain was called on and he
declared himself, in favor of the eight
hour system.
The boilermakers. despairing of making
a satisfactory settlement with the shops,
took action s : tated to order a strike.
Boilermakers were at work yesterday on
the Relief and the Marlposa, but they
will be called off to-day.

Rev. W. Reynolds, pastor of Lebanon
Church, conducted the services. After the
reading of the scriptures the Rev. Dr.
Mackenzie was introduced to deliver the
sermon of the day. He said in part:
It will be the happy duty of the pastor
of this church to preach to you the srospel,
the word of God's love. I want to speak
to you of the purpose of this lave. In (rod's
economy there is nothing in vain â nothing
walks with aimless feet. This is as true
in the sphere of grace as It le in the Bphere
i of nature. God's love is descending upon
us in order that we may become the sons
of r.o<l, His dear childrenâ in the homely
Scotch word, the only synonym of the
i original Greek. His bairns.
The family of mankind is divided Into
! two classes, those who .-'.re ami tbOK who
are not. the children of God In the true
sense. Those whom the Lord loves, he
' chasten?. If you are His clear son, He will
not spare discipline.
After the propounding of the constitu
tional questions, the choir, which con
sists of Miss Alma Berglund. Miss G. H.
< Van Pelt. F. Purdy and C. E. Kerr,
! rendered the beautiful anthem. "He Shall
1 Come Down Like Rain." The Rev. Dr.
! Carson of Trinity Church with solemn
' words then delivered the charge to the
I pastor. Dr. Hemphill of Calvary Church
concluded the services with the charge to
the congregation.
