Will again be disputed.
LONDON, Nov. 25.â The
position in Natal remains
full of perplexities, which
the censorship lias increased. Al
though a division and a half have
now reached Durban that place isj
practically powerless until sup
plied with cavalry and artillery,
and until these arrive the situation
will undoubtedly remain grave.
With three beleaguered garrisons
in Xatal besides KimU-rlev and
Mafeking, and no signs of succor
in the immediate future, it is no
wonder that the outlook is re
garded as distinctly gloomy to
night and that the most possible
is made of General Methuen's
success, such as it was. That bat
tle decided nothing, and it seems
certain that many experts are of
the opinion that the story of the
return of the pursuing cavalry
without getting in touch with the
retreating Boers indicates that
the cavalry discovered in time
that if it had gone on it would
soon have been on the Pretoria
racecourse with its comrades of
the Hussars.
It will not surprise any one
greatly if the Boers are shortly
again discovered in an in
trenched position near the spot
from which General Methuen has
just evicted them.
From no other point can even
a semblance of success be report
ed. Mafeking is apparently in
a worse plight than the Britishers
have hitherto cared to admit, and
it is difficult to see how it can be
relieved for some time to come.
While the official dispatch from
the Boer head laager outside of
Ladysmith, dated November 24,
FOR THE RELIEF OF KIMBERLEY.
LONDON, Nov. 2S.â A special
dispatch from Durban, dated Fri

kinK and Klmberley have been re
lieved.

Is discredited by a special dispatch

that General ICethuen is in hello

showed that the town was still
flying the Union Jack on Friday
the cheerful tone of the message
and the evident anticipation of
the speedy reduction of Lady
smith are not calculated to cheer
anxious relatives.
The reported silence of the
British puns also again arouses
fears of a shortness of ammuni
tion, and the fact that the Boers
have just placed in position an
other siege gun shows that they
have not yet done their worst.
The arrival of the German offi
cers, one of whom, it is under
stood, pained large experience in
reducing a fortified town in 1870
71, is calculated to lead to a
change of tactics which will add
to the suspense of the sorely tried
garrison.
The situation in the northern
portion of Cape Colony is about
as unsatisfactory as it can be.
Boers are turning up in all direc
tions.
A Cape Town dispatch re
ceived at a late hour to-night re
ports that the enemy have blown
up a railway bridge between Ros
mead Junction and Middleburg
with the object of preventing an
! advance from Port Elizabeth.
This was effected by a small com
mando which, it is stated, remains
in the neighborhood. The effect
of blowing up this bridge will
tend to isolate Nauwpoort, which
was recently reoccupied by the
British, and musi delay the ad
vance of the troops just arrived
at Port Klizabeth.

DEWEY'S SENSATIONAL
PLEDGE TO AGUINALDO
Important Secret Correspond
ence on Philippine War.
Rebel Aid Accepted by American Generals
in Exchange for a Promise of Fili
pino Independence.
For some tlmo past there have been
fragmentary outgivings at Washington
of copies of correspondence had between
Agulnaldo and American civil and mili
tary officer*, running from May or June.
1898. down to recent dates. The Call sought
to find the source through which these
copies found their way to this country
ADMIRAL DEWEY.
and to the partial publication they have
received. The fact! developed show the
pitiful straits to which th.- Filipinos were
reduced, their childlike confidence In the
justice of their cause and their Innocent
belief that If they could be heard In this
country their cry for mercy and Justice
would be heeded. Therefore, when In
formed that such means of Influential
communication had been provided they
believed Implicitly the representations
made to them. Upon Investigation It Is
shown that Mr. Alvah Udell, known In
this State In various ways, professed to
have made an organization of Americans,
influential and powerful, who would pre
sent the Filipino case. The native lead
ers, Informed of this through the Junta
at Hongkong, began forwarding state
ments of the situation, of their claims
and copies of a very voluminous corre
spondence, the originals Of which are un
derstood to be In Agulnaldo's possession.

with other letters not copied but hold In
reserve. The only Impression so far made
by the partial disclosure of these things
has been to Increase the anxiety of the
Government to take Agutnaldo prisoner.
In order to pet possession of the originals.
This raises the presumption that these
documents make out a better case for the
Filipinos than our authorities have been
willing to admit. Many thins* have Riven
rise to a suspicion In this country that
we and not he Filipinos chanced front and
had to disappoint expectations for which
our representatives were directly respon
sible. It will be remembered that when
Admiral Dewey arrived in this country
his tone varied from numerous utterances
before that time. and when he advised the
administration to augment the fleet as
well as the army be said he desired Ak
ulnaldo to know that he bad so advised.
Of course, but one Interpretation could
be put upon this. The admiral must have

GENERAL ANDERSON.
felt that AKulnaldo had some reason to
expect a different move on his part. If
there were not this reason there was none
at all for such a request, t
The Call has secured the mass of matter
that resulted from Filipino dependence on
Mr. Udell's representations. These were
In the form of an address "To the Fili
pinos. and Their Compatriots in the Phil
ippine*." which, while rather contempti
ble In its composition where, It Is not an
awkward paraphrase of the Declaration
of Independence, has certain features that
show Mr. Udell to have a good deal of In
genuity. Among these Is a very earnest
deprecation of the resistance offered by
th" Filipinos to the American Govern
ment in Its effort to restore order. They
nre advised to deslrt and to put the: "/el
fare In the ki-ti>lng of Mr. Udell's organ
ization, which seems to have consisted of
himself. Some, features of the addres*
would be laughable were It not for thÂ«Â»
background of sorrow anil - slaughter In
the islands. 'and the reaching out of weak
hands to what seemed to be a chance for
a hearing. . Among other things Mr. Udell
tells them: "In your behalf we have
given our approval to a new organic law
prepared for the government of the Phil
ippines and entitled a 'Constitution of
the United Free States.* which will per
petually establish your liberties and erect
a republic of enduring strength In the
archipelago."
Mr. Udell does not furnish a copy of this
marvelous self-acting, automatic, funda
mental law. but It no doubt raised high
hopes among the poor creatures who
heard of It.
As far as possible we have arranged thÂ«
documents In their chronological order.
Mr. Udell having Impressed the Impor
tance of his position upon the Hongkong
Junta, his personality may now bÂ« dis
missed and the documents which followed,
the presentation of his pretentious claims
may be considered for the value to history
Of their disclosures.

tn Hongkong:
"My Dear General: Mr. Agoncillo
has written me that you wish to send
some of your Spanish prisoner to
Hongkong. In case your prisoners
can pay stfamer fare and H. E., tha
admiral, has no objection to their
leaving. I see no objection to your re
lieving yourself of them, on their
oath not to take up arms again. If
you find any of them break oath and
you capture them with arms in their
hands give them the full penalty.
However, do not let any of our prom
inent prisoners leave or escape. Keep
them as hostages. You may need
them to redeem some of your own
generals. Never mind about finding
them three meals a day. Rice and
wnter will be a good diet. They have
been living too high the last few
years.
"The captain of Mr. Agoncillc's
steamer, the Fasig, delayed all our
plans and made the police very
watchful. However, Mr. Evans is
working as rapidly as possible. Very
truly,
"ROUNSEVILLE WTLDMAN,
"Consul General."
It will be observed that the signature ,
Is official, and that Consul Wildman was |
engaged in co-operation with Aguinaldo |
to the extent of violating international i
and neutrality treaties by sliding the Pa- [
Big from Hongkong laden with arms for |
the Filipinos. Ills reference to "our ]
plans" is instructive in the li^ht of Pratt'*
action and subsequent dismissal.
In his next letter of Juue 2S. ISM. Consul
Wildman Bays: "Now inasmuch as the
Spanish want more bloodshed In the Phil
ippines. I trust you will give them a taste
of real war. Do not be so tender with
them. Handle them as they would treat
you.
t â¢'I am sorry Mr. Evans has not
been able to get more arms to you.
He has started three times, but the i
police have headed him off. They are
on the alert sine, the capture of th*
Pasig."
"VVildman's next to Ag-jinaldo was on
July 14, 1696, and says:
"You have nobly fulfilled all the
promises I made for you to Admiral
Dewey. I am very sorry Mr. Evans
has not been able to deliver to youths
arms. The seizure of the Pasig ha 3
put every official, Chinese and Eng
lish, on the watch. I hear that the
Pasig is now at Macao and is going
from there to Canton to try and ship
arms. I hope it will succeed and they
will soon be with you."
In his next Consul Wildman says: "I
have vouched for your honesty of purpose
to tho President of the United States.
"Do not forget that the United
States undertook tuis war for the sole
purpose of relieving the Cubans from
the cruelties under which they were
suffering, and not for the love of con
quest or the hope of gain. They are
actuated by precisely the same feel
ings toward the Filipinos. Whatever
may be the final disposition of the
I conquered territory you can trust the
United States that justice and honor
will control all their dealings with
you."
Next follows Agulnaldo'a proclamation,
written for him by Consul 'Wlldman, es
tablishing the Filipino government, under i
which all of his military operations were
conducted and which was "to fit our
country for inclusion in the comity
of civilized states, like our neighbor,
Japan.'
This was 1fÂ«uo(1 May 24. IS9S.
June 16 Admiral Dewey acknowledges
receipt of letters from Aguinaldo enclos
ing decrocs of Filipino Government/ which
the admiral "Hikes pleasure in transmit
ting to my Government,"
Then follow letters from Dewey to
Aguinaldo, asking passes for various
Englishmen and others who desired
to visit the interior.
July 18 Dewey transmits to AgutnaJdo a
letter of the French Consul In regard tO
the capture cf a French ship by the Fili- ;
pinos. Dowey sajb: "As my forces were
i not concerned In this capture, I transmit
tho letter with a request that you show
due regard for French Interests."
Then follow long letters from Otis
to Aguinaido asking co-operation,
and making a variety of such re
quests as under public law can only
bÂ« asked of or granted by. a govern
ment de facto.
General Anderson appears on the scene \
July C asking of Agulnaldo "your Excel
lency's advice and co-operation, for I am
solicitous to avoid any oonillct of author
ity which might result from having two

maud In the same place. Your sanitary
ofllcers havo be e n making an Inspection ',

eases if the vicinity Is not made clean.
Would it not be wtll to have prisoners do
the cleaning under advice of tho sur

In further correspondence General An

military and strategic maps.

cayÂ» they may depend upon "the friendly
protection of the United States."
After the Spanish surrender of
Manila the correspondence shows that
] Otis claimed jurisdiction only over
Manila, "its suburbs and defenses,
' which the United States is compelled
: to occupy and administer under its
national obligations to Spain." The
rest of Luzon was acknowledged by
Otis to be under the control and juris
diction of Aguinaldo.
The foregoing comprises all that is of
present interest in the batch of docu
ments. In disconnected and unverified
form much of It has appeared. It will
form the basis of the discussions which

Mayor-Elect.
WOULD NOT TAKE ORDERS
LAND ALLIED WITH BART CAY-
ANAUGH.
Will Make a Determined Effort to
Turn Down Suilivan, Clarke's
Choice for Chief of Sacra
mento Police Force.
Special Dispatch to TbÂ» Call.
SACRAMENTO. Nov. 23.â Falling to In
fluence Mayor-elect Clarke to do their
bidding, the disgruntled gang of political
ward heelers, headed by the scheming
"Bart" Cavanaugh. have resolved to do
all In their power to cripple his adminis
tration. Their first move in that direction
will be to defeat the appointment of "Jack"
Sullivan, the popular Deputy Assessor, for
Chief of Police. Sullivan is a warm friend
of the new Mayor, and as a reward for Ma
political services during the recent cam
paign Clarke Intended to make him head
cf the. Police Department.
On hearing that Sullivan was tho choice
of the Mayor-elect for Chief of Police, the
despicable Cavanaugh swore loudly and
proclaimed himself dictator. Going to
Clarke he demanded of him to sidetrack
Sullivan and appoint William Ahem, a
railroad detective, Chief of Police. Alter
admiring Cavunaugh's audacity the
Mayor-elect emphatically told him that
he would make his own appointments,
and ordered him out of his otlice.
Coli' Cav
anaugh informed them of Clarke's
"treachery," and "rdere'l them to get

wreak bwift vengeance on the man who
not only questioned his power, but

"This fello-ar Clarke is no good, see."
ho Is quoted as saying. I'm after his
scalp, ami must have It. You stand In
with mo. and I'll make him wish he never
had been elected Mayor."
Land strenuously denies * that Cav
anaugh's utterances had any effect on
him, but nevertheless It is known that in
order to circumvent the selection of Sulli
i van as Chief of Police, ho Intends on next
Monday night to appoint Mose Drew, who
is well known here, head of the Police
Department.
malign claims that he has "fixed"
! a majority of the Board of Trustees to
vote to confirm the appointment.
Clarke's friends are Indignant at the
attitude of Mayor Land and openly assert
: that ho Is Ing influenced by the de
' throned boss. Every effort is being made
to induce Land to reconsider his deter
mination, but with little hope of success.
When seen to-day the Mayor-elect said,
when speaking about the situation:
"I fully expected that the appointment
of Chief of Police would fall to mo and
was disagreeably surprised to k-arn that
Mayor Land had chosen Drew for the
place." < :
"I have nothing against Drew, but
would prefer to have my friend Sullivan
'at the head of the Police Department. it
has been the custom for the retiring
Mayor to leave the appointment of a
Chief of Police to the incoming executive,
but it seems to have been overlooked by
Land. However. I am not discouraged
and hope for the best."
Land's antagonism to Clarke dates back
' to the late convention. The present Mayor
had hoped to control the majority of dele
gates and get them to renomlnato him.
His plans failed, and Clarke was nom
inated. Since then Land has not been
any too friendly with the Mayor-elect. It
is known that Russ Stephens, the Demo
cratic candidate, had promised to make
Drew Chief of Police In case he was elect
ed. Iloth Drew and Land made a hard
fight for him. but their efforts went for
naught.
Anxious to be revenged on Clarke it was
arranged that Land should appoint Drew
Chief of Police, which ho intends to do at
tho next meeting of the Board of Trustees.

guard of a hundred soldiers. Reaching
the neighborhood of the coast November
13, Buencamino found American soldiers
on every side and escape Impossible. So
he sought refuge in a little Pangaslnan
village, near Manao:iK. where the natives
were lukewarm towurd the Insurrection.
<>n learning his Identity some refugees
brought the news on November 20 to Col

Thirty-third Infantry, garrisoning
Manaoag. After communicating with
General Wheaton, Cronin's Battalion sur
rounded the village November 21. Euen
*aminos guard had hidden their rifles and
uniforms and Buencamino surrendered
without resistance. He had only a few
clothes and $2000 in gold.
General Wheaton kept the woman and
child and sent Buencamino Â«to Manila on
the transport Brutus, in charge of Lieu
â¢- Smith of the Twentieth Infantry.
Buencamino seemed cheerful and rather
glad that his troubles had culminated.
On the arrival of the Brutus at Manila
this morning, LieuU-r.ant Smith took
Buencamino to the palace. He was only

General Otis then summoned Provost

structions to iock him up in comfortable
quarters and allow no person to see him.

nine-tenths of the people of Luzon Is a
fugitive In the mountains, with small
I hope of re-establishing the machine. The
i army is scattered In the hills on both
; Bides of the railroad and widely separated
detachments are within the cordon which
Generals Lawton and Wheaton have ce
mented.
The ruling spirit of the Cabinet is a
prisoner in Manilaâ a white elephant on
the hands of the authorities â and the
small fry are tumbling over one another
to get to Manila. Three Provisional Gov
ernors have arrived in Manila to request
General Otis to Install them In their old
otlices under the new regime. Dr. Luna,
a brother of General Luna, and a promi
nent insurrectionist, has arrived here, MJid
lils friends and many others are applying
to General Otis for permission to enjoy
the luxuries of Manila ufter months of
. from civilization.
There were no demonstrations over the
victory here, the Hags are flying at

SCHURMAN AND LONG
TALK OF PHILIPPINES
PHILADELPHIA. Nov. 25-The Union
League celebrated the thirty-sixth anni
versary of its founding by a banquet at
the clubhouse to-night. John L>. Long,
Secretary of the Navy, and Jacob Gould
Schurman, president of Cornell University
and president of the Philippine Commlft
sion, were the guests uf honor and the
principal speakers.
Professor Bchurman in his address said
the American tlag had been planted In
tlit- Philippine* and was there to stay.
Hon. John D. Long, Secretary of the
N.tvy, upon bemg introduced, described
the great popular demonstration which
he had witnessed earlier In the day at the
funeral of Vice President Hobart. when
the late neighbors of the distinguished
statesmen had evinced their sorrow and
respect for his memory. He said:
"Let us congratulate ourselves on the
condition in which the country la now
under the present administration of af
fairs, the admirable condition of its in
dustries and its business. Tell me what
there Is you would have otherwise than it
is, the principle of the government you
would have eniorced that is not to-day in
force, what line of development you would
seek that is not the line on which your
Government is now proceeding.
"With regard to the Philippine ques
tion, it occurs to ask whether or not.
some thirty years from now, somebody
may not rise in this hall and say: '1 re
member that in UN there were excellent
people who said the despotisms of the old
world were as nothing as compared with
the tyranny of William McKinley.' Ah:
thirty years from now not only will our
people be rejoicing in the humanity and
the generous spirit which haa animated
this administration In its attitude toward
the Philippines In giving them the bless
ings of good government, but the next
generation of the Inhabitants of these
Island! will recall the establishment
among them of the school, the ship, the
Institutions of liberty, and will thank God
that, under the shelter of the broad shield
of the United States, they find realization
of their dream of a larger liberty In be
coming American citizens. If Imperialism
means the subjugation of a people or the
deprivation of their rights, then there is
not an imperialist in the length and
breadth of our land, but If imperialism
means the extension of the American in
stitution among those people who have
come under the shield of the United
States, then we are all Imperialists."

i-tiiition for its policy In the Philippines.
The point in his addressâ and It was all
punctuated with applauseâ which aroused
most enthusiasm was when he declared
that if President McKinley is the candi
date of the Rt-publican party next year
on a platform embodying his present pol
icy ho will be as surprised ii man on th*Â»

INSURGENTS OF PANAY
ISLAND DRIVEN BACK
MA A, Nov. 25â movement
against the Insurgents in the Island of
Tnnay has resulted in driving thorn to the
mountains twenty miles Inward. The
troops engaged were two battalions of the
Nineteenth Regiment, a battalion of
the Twenty-sixth Regiment, the Eight
eenth Regiment, Gordon mounted scouts
and Uridgman's battery of the Sixth Ar
tillery. '
The Americans in all lost five men killed
and had thirty-eight men wounded. Gen-
I Hughes, General Carpenter and Colo
nel Edmund^ Rice commanded during : the
various lights. Thirty-two Inaurcenu
were killed In the engagements and the
natives reported that nineteen* carloads of
wounded were taken away.
Among the Americans killed were a
lieutenant of the Eighteenth Regiment
and a sergeant of artillery. Twelve obso
lete cannon were captured. Santa Bar
bara and Maasin arsenal were deserted
before the Americans arrived. The In
surgents seeing It was Impossible to resist
the movement retired with most of their
stores.
The Third Infantry reconnolterlng from
Ballnag met the insurgents on the main
road and had a running fight to San Ilde
fonso, where they drove three hundred
Filipinos from an old Spanish redoubt.
Proceeding toward San Miguel, the
Americans found the insurgents In a
series of strong works, two miles south
of the town, probably General Pio del
Pllar's old command, numbering 750 men.
An officer and a private were killed. The
insurgents had four men killed and ten
wounded. Nine Filipinos were captured.
This is probably the largest band of insur
gents north of the Paslg River.
PILAR'S ATTEMPT
TO AID AGUINALDO
WASHINGTON, Nov. 25.â The War De
partment officials are disposed to account
for the sudden activity developed by the
insurgents south of Manila, as reported
this morning, on the assumption that the
insurgent general in command there be
lieved to be Plo del Pilar, has received
notice through some of his spies of the
desperate straits of Agulnaldo and is
manfully trying to create a diversion in
his favor by attacking the American
force from the rear. He occupies strong
defensive ground, and Cavlte province,
the home of Agulnaldo, has never been
taken by the Spaniards since the first
hostilities.
General Schwan, assisted by the ma
rines from the naval station at Cavite,
made a raid through the territory last
summer, but it was during the wet sea
son, the swamps were deep, and beyond
driving the insurgents off temporarily
nothing substantial was achieved, and the
country was abandoned to the Insurgents.
Now. however, with the advent of the dry
Bea.-Â«on. the time Is ripe for the execution
of the plans of General Otis to clear out
this country permanently and carry out
his favorite project for the Installment In
the province of municipal governments,
and General Grant, In command there. Is
being reinforced with that special abject.

LONDON, Nov. 25.â One of the most re
markable reports afloat here Is that the
Rtrdlr, Lord Kitchener, will b Â» sent to
South Africa. This la only partly true.
"What Is the fact on the subiect I." that,
were there to be serious reverses to the
British forcesâ which seems little likely
from latest reports â Lord Kitchener, as a
practical fighting man, would be called
upon. In the meantime Lord Wolseley
has the utmost faith in Sir KeOvtrs Dul
ler, who Is his warm personal friend, and
who has with General Sir Evelyn Woods
and Sir Charles Warren worked out the
entire plan of campaign. Sir Charles
Warren's appointment, although he Is of
an age where he would under ordinary
circumstances be retired, Is intensely pop
ular. His bock upon the valu* of scout
ing In South Africa is a military classic
and describes Just the kind of warfare
now being waged.
It may Becma strange thin* to say, but
until yesterday, when the people heard of
Mothuen's success, the British here had
had no news of any account for well nigh
a fortnight. The result was that the peo
ple hud grown extremely nervous. The
place to witness sentimental Interest in the
war IB the special room In St. James
street at the side of the War Office spe
cially set .aside for ladles. I was there a
few minutes ago. It was crowded with
fashionably dressed mothers, wives and
sisters, rubbing elbows with the humblest
but Juut as keenly anxious as the rela
tives of "Tommy Atkins." It Is a regular
thing nowadays Instead of taking a walk

Sir Redvers Buller before he left made
special conditions as to taking command.
One was perfect, freedom of action uuun
the carrying out of a prearranged plan of
campaign.- The second was that his dis
patches should not be made public. This
accounts for the absolute dearth of news
of lat-.Â» and the correspondingly great
number of absolutely false reports which
na ie been published by correspondent
and editors driven to despair in their at
tempts to find food for the clamoring

the i.:!'.r'..i.:Â« were not quitÂ«Â» clear as to
where the fault rested. The expert has

with a freedom that must have been Irri

have had the tendency to embarrass our

This was especially true, it Is said, of
the bÂ»ef and tausace negotiations. There
Is no question as to the rtpht of Germany
to cause thÂ» recall of any person attached
to the United States embassy at Berlin
upon representations that he Is persona

MILLER SUCCESSFULLY
EVADES NEW YORK POLICE
Swindler of the Franklin Syndicate
an Old Offender Who Has Served
a Term for Forgery.
NEW YORK. Nov. 25.â There was a sign
to-day on the front door of the Franklin
Syndicate headquarters at 144 Floyd
street. Brooklyn, which read:
"Closed on Saturday."
Various reports were current regarding
the whereabouts of William F. Miller, the
ostensible head of the syndicate.
Yesterday Miller disappeared at noon,
having learned that the Kings County
Grand Jury had Indicted him for con
spiracy with intent to defraud, and that
a bench warrant had been Issued for his
arrest. It was said that Miller came to
the Borough of Manhattan and escaped
under the eyes of detectives. Some
think that he Is still In Manhattan. Others
think that he has by this time toft
Greater New York far behind, either by
a European steamer or by railroad train.
His brother. Louis H. Miller, cashier of
the Franklin Syndicate, who was arrest
ed last night when the ploice raided the.
offices of the concern, was taken to court
to-day and held In $1000 ball to answer the
charge of having aided his brother in de
frauding creditors. $*500 having been
found by the police, which they allege the
prisoner concealed in the house adjoining
the Franklin Syndicate offices. :/
All day a crowd of excited depositors
held tne Fort at 144 Floyd street, which
fort, however, was well guarded by po
lice, some of whom had tnemselves been
enriched by the interest of 10 per cent a
week on earnings they had placed in
Miller's hands for investment.
Floyd street was the scene of great ex
citement. The crowd was made up large
ly of women. Some of them had remain
ed throughout Friday night, hoping that
"the young Napoleon of Finance" would
return with his extraordinary dividends
and pay them their interest or thir prin
cipal. At midnight Friday, overcome by
excitement and her losses, Mrs. A. M.
Cheney, who Is said to have lost the sav
ings of a lifetime, dropped dead. Several
women fainted, and to-day the police had
much difficulty in keeping back the surg-
I iiitr mobs.
Early to-day the police sent out a gen
eral alarm for the apprehension of Wil
liam F. Miller, as follows:
"Arrest for grand larceny William F.
Miller. 36 years. 5 feet 5 Inches, 140 pounds,
dark mustache, small side whiskers, brok
en nose, mixed gray suit and overcoat,
light alpine hat.
The police also sent out a general alarm
for the apprehension of Cecil Leslie, Mil
ler's private secretary, who acted also as
| his press agent and who Is in a measure
[ responsible for the recent publication of
the story of Miller's greatness and his Im
aginary prowess in Wall street.
All the banks In the city were notified
by the police to-day to hold any money
In their possession deposited to the ac
count of William F. Miller or the Frank
lin Syndicate, pending the developments
In the indictment of Miller and Leslie. The
police also set about to keep an eye on
certain banks and trust companies where
Miller is supposed to h*ve money on de
posit. Notwithstanding the fact that Mil
ler withdrew from Wells, Fargo & Co.'s
bank more than $100,000 about Thursday
the police placed detectives in this bank,
believing that he still has deposits there.
Regarding the report that Miller had
placed $100,000 In the C*erman Consulate,
the acting German Consul General. K.
Bess, Mid to-day that Miller had not de
posited that sum or any other sum of
money with the Consulate, and he had no
knowledge of the matter.
"We are not In the habit of doing such
things," he said. "If we did anything we
would help the authorities to exposÂ© sus
picious characters. I have no Idea wheth
er Miller Is a German citizen or not."
It was said that J. C. Htndrix, president
of the Union National Bank and repre
senting the American Bankers' Associa
tion, had submitted most of thÂ« evidence
on which Miller and Leslie were indicted.
The work of procuring this was started
and accumulated chiefly through the ef
forts of the Fourth National Bank. It
was the Fourth National Bank that first
exposed the doing of Rev. P. F. Jernegan
of the "Sea Water Gold" company, which
afterward collapsed.
Officers of the Fourth National Bank
were not disposed to say much about the
matter to-day, but they admitted that a
score or more of drafts on Miller's syndi
cate had poured In on them to-day, large
ly from Ohio towns, and ranging In
amounts from 15 to $50. being for weekly
Interest payments.
According to Wall-street brokers, nearly
all of .the country depositors of the syndi
cate left both principal and Interest In the
concern, and will lose all they have In
vested.
A pile of telegrams six Inches high lay
in front of Postmaster Wilson of the
borough of Brooklyn to-day, each one
about a plea to stop payment on a money
order or to hold up a registered letter
All of Miller's mail has been held up. He
received 500 ordinary and fifty registered
letters dally on an average. His money
orders varied from $5000 to $13,000' dally
Almost every town In the United States
seemed to be represented In the list
All of the sums sent now In the hands of
the postal authorities will be refunded
The World will to-morrow say: Miller Is
an ex-convict, and he is well known to thÂ»
people of Lynn. Mass.. where he formerly
resided. He was arrested there on Sep
tember 20. ISTÂ«. on the charge of forgery
it being claimed that he obtained posses
sion of a large sum of money from a
friend. He was tried, convicted and sen
tenced to the Concord reformatory
Miller's photograph adorns the rogues'
gallery polite headquarters in Lynn
and Is No. 3.3. Where ho originally came
from the authorities there do not know
but he was in that vicinity for several
years. He never resorted to manual labor
fur a living while In Lynn. The police of
Lynn are on the watch for him. as it is
known that he has many friends and ac
quaintances there to whom he may appeal
Miller was also know n In Boston and
until two weeks ago he maintained a
branch office In the Charlestown district!
Hundreds of Boston men and women
mostly laboring people, have been swl":
died by Investing" money with the con
cern The total of the amounts so placed
In this vicinity Is estimated at $100,000
It Is known that Miller recently visited
some conservative bond houses and
opened negotiations for the purchase of
gilt-edged securities, such as railroad and
municipal bonds. He has purchased a
large number of these bonds.
The Postofflee Department at Washing
ton Immediately on learning of Miller's
Indictment Issued orders that no more
mall should be delivered to thÂ« Franklin
Syndicate and that no further business
should be transacted with It by the de
partment.
Postmaster Wilson of Brooklyn Â«ays
that the sum total of the money intrust
ed to Miller will reach an enormous
amount. Postofflce Inspectors have dis
covered that Miller deposited as high as
SI i. OOO a day in one bank In the lower part
of the city. The record of the money
order department shows that Miller's
business during the last six weeks has
been growing by leaps and bounds. Every
day he has cashed money orders aggre
gating between WOO and $7000. and one
day the amount ran up to $13,000.

agreeing to pay her a stipulated sum per

does not appear In the pleadings
The decree of divorce was granted last
Thursday, but has not vet been entered as
a matter of record owing to the fact that
the costs in the case have not yet been
paid. Lawyers say that until the decree
Is entered up the matter stands as though
no divorce had been granted, and that in

she could successfully prosecute him for

sufferer from heart trouble for some time,
but It was only during the last ten days
that he was confined to the house. Until
then he waa actively engaged In business.
His family and friends have been aware
of his condition for some time and his
death was not unexpected. All the mem
bers of his family were present at Colonel
Davis' bedside when he expired. No ar
rangements for the funeral have yet been
made.

Acting Upon Her Husband's
Advice.
Special Cable- to The Call and the New York
Herald. Copyright, 1599. by Junes Gordon
Bennett.
LONDON. Nov. 25â Mm. Langtry Is go-
Ing to sell her racing string. This she
does at the desire of her husband. Since
her marriage Mr*. Langtry's position had
changed a great deal, and she is grad
ually falling buck Into society again,
among her good friends being Lily, Duch
ess of Marlbnrough, Lady de Grey and -<o
on. This last week she was stopping with
Lord and Lady Marcus lieresford. She
Is looking so well since her marriage that
evt-ry one who sees her remarks upon It.
Mrs. de Uathe Is very busy Just now
getting ready many new dresses of won
drous beauty for her trip in the I'nlted
Stales. Last evening Mrs. Langtry cele
br;tt>ii the one hundredth performance of
"Tha Degenerates" by giving away a
beautiful satin souvenir, upon which was
printed Kudyard Kipling's "Absent
minded R<'ggar." which piece she recited.
attended by boys of the Duke of York's
school. To see the little fellows appear
ing upon the stage ln uniform and watch
li.K Mrs. l.angtry go through the recita
tion was Intensely amusing. The expres
sion on their faces was half admiration,
half awe. Mrs. Langtry recited the piece
very well Indeed, and the house, which
was packed, was enthusiaatlc to a degree.
ODD CHINESE VENGEANCE.
Sam Yups Cause the Arrest of Ten
See Yups.
BAN RAFAEL. Nov. 25â The celestial
Idea of vengeance for an affront or some
thing more serious has undergone a
marked revision. When Wong Ho, the
Chinese fisherman of Point San Pedro,
Informed the Nlng Yung Society that Lee
Doo Teong. his partner, had been mur
dered by Lee Lin Ling, it was commonly
supposed that more blood would flow. An
attempt was made to murder a relative
named Lee Ah Lln^. but since that oc
currence the Sam Yups have adoptod a
different planâ a plan which, viewed -n
the light of Chinese custom and tradi
tion, seems almost freakish.
To-day Constable GeorgÂ« Acnow
marched through town as guardian jf ten
Chinese fishermen. They came from San
Pedr > Point and were nil members of the
See Yups. Agnew took them before a Jus
tice of the Peace an.l swore t<< OOmplalnt*
charging each of his charges w'th illegal
tishlng on account of their use of drag
i>t-is\ In lieu ot 12000 t>ai. they are now
confined ln the County Jail
As the Chinese were being taken to Jail
a number of their countryman from the
lisM ig camp â all Sam Yupsâ stood on the
corner and made free ntc ot tuunttf and
derisive epithets. Instead of killing one
of the See Yups the clansmen '-t *,cc Doo
Teong had informed on them for illegal
Qshlng and were laughing at their dis
comfiture.
BATTLED WITH WAVES.
Unpleasant Experience of Two Men
on the Bay at Night
SAUSALITO. Nov. George Hard
man and S. 11. Henton. two employes of
the Coast Contracting Company, had a
harrowing experience on the bay in a
small skiff last Thursday evening. After
a hard struggle they managed to reach
shore half a mile below Old Sausalito
about 10 o'clock that night drenched to
the skin And exhausted.
The Coast Contracting Company has
the contract to blow up Shag and Arch
rocks, and the two employes were en
gaged In drilling a hole in Shag Rock, in
which a bolt was placed, to which the
painter of a boat was to be tied. At six
o'clock they left the rock and started for
Sausallto. a distance of nearly two miles.
They were buffeted about by wind and
â waves for about three hours In the dark
ness, and while one rowed the other was
busied in bailing the water out of the
skiff, which almost filled three times ami
was in danger of capsizing twice. Sinco
this adventure the men have left the rock
at 4 o'clock every afternoon, giving them
selves plenty of time to reach land before
night.

Dependable Drugs
Prescription
Carefulness
In no department of
our store do we pay so
much attention to lit-
tle details as in the
prescription room. No
other department re-
cuires so much care-
fulness.
Medicine cannot be
too carefully com-
pounded â health de-
mands care and quality.
The nearness of our
prescription room is
above criticism. Im-
plements and bottles
are spotlessly dean.
We never fill a sec-
ond hand bottle, for
no one knows what it
might have contained
since it first left our
store.
Second hand corks
are never used.
Our label is pasted
on every cork, over
which is tied a yellow
cap, scaling the bottle,
insuring the customer
against adulteration or
changes.
We fill every pre-
scription just as the
doctor writes it.

Facial Dlepatch to The Call.
LOUISVILLE. K> . Nov. S.â ThÂ«
Commercial to-morrow (Till say:
Governor Bradley to-day received
a letter threatening him with as
sassination. The le;ter. which was
addressed elmply â¢â¢William O.
Bradley," was mailed at Frank
fort. It reads:
"Governor William O. Bradley:
Tour resignation is requested im
mediately. If not we will murder
you. FOES."
Below this was drawn a rude rep
resentation of a tkull and cross
bones, and underneath that three
crorsmarks. The handwriting: was
evidently disguised. There was not
a misspelled word In the letter.
The letter Is believed to bÂ« the
work of a crank.
FRANKFORT, Ky., Nov. 25.âThe Court
of Appeals to-day clinched Taylor's right
to 11*7 Nelson County votes. The court,
all the Judges concurring, refused to dis
solve- the Injunction, as was asked for by
Goebel's attorneys. The votes in contro
versy were certl.".ed for "W. P." Instead
of "W. S." Taylor. Judge Jones of Nasoa
County ordered the votes counted for W.
6. Taylor and this order is affirmed.
The Democratic leaders now assert that
Goebel will not contest before the Legis
lature If he Is not given the certlllcate of
ejection by the board, which convenes
h**re on Saturday. Taylor's managers axe
dubious on this point. *uj the statement
tnat ne would contest has not been denied
by Goebel hlnisNf.
Yesterday waa the last day under which
contests could be nieU against the Re
publican members-elect to the Legislature
and the fact that about ten contents were
nled against members, seven against the
House and three against the Senate, is
regarded as Indicating that the Demo
crats are doing this as a precautionary
mt*aÂ«ure to secure a safe majority in both
hou*t>6 in the event that a contest Is de
termined on.
benator Goebel was reinforced to-day
by the arrival of nearly ail the candidates
on his ticket. Chairman Smith of the
State Central Committee and others who
will be here until the fight ends. Infor
mation here Is that several thousand per

Governor Bradley â¢â¢:;: maintains a guard
at the State arsenal and it Is said the
war department was never to fully
equipped with shooting material. The
Governor himse>lf absolutely refuses to
disclose Ms position, but the movements
of Adjutant General Collier are supposed
to be under his direction. This strongly
Indicates that he is preparing to take
nome kind of vigorous a."ion and the
prospects for trouble ee*m to be growing
as the day of final settlement approaches.

chain parted and the vessel and her crew
were at the mercy of the furious sea.
The vessel could not be controlled, and
each wave carried It with tremendous
force toward the sunken rocks. A great
wave broke amidships, and the men
Jumped Into the lifeboat. No sooner a ':
they done so than they saw a great wave
completely swallow up the Santa Rosa

PATERSON, N. J., Nov. 25.â With the '
Impressive religious cervices of the Pres
byterian church and with the dignity due
to his high office, all that Is mortal of the
Vice President, Garret A. Hobart. was
committed to the earth this afternoon,
The President. Secretary of State John '
Hay, Chief Justice Fuller, former Vice
President Levi P. Morton, former Secre
tary of War Alger, Secretary of the Inte
rior Hitchcock, the Supreme Court Judges,
members of the Senate, members of Con
gress and the Vice President's personal
friends filled the beautiful Church of tho
Redeemer and with moistened eyes and
bowed head testified silently and eloquent
ly to his worth as a statesman, friend and
neighbor.
Through the west window, from the cen
! ter of the stained-glass Maltese cross,
pierced a shaft of crimson that shed its
; light around the catafalque and bathed
; the orchids, narcissus blossoms and white
i roses In bright tints. The eye of the cler
gyman traveled along the shaft of light
to the cross as he repeated the words:
"The Lord gave and the Lord hath taken
away; blessed be the name of the Lord."
The chief magistrate of the country
i bowed his head in his hands. He wan vis
j ibly agitated. There was scarcely a dry
cheek In the crowded edifice, and the
widow was apparently the most compobed.
All the pomp of an official pageant,
j which was omitted in deference to the
wishes of the deceased, could never have
caused the impresslveneaa of this scene.
The Imposing and solemn strains of Chop
; ln"s funeral march filled the edifice with
< its solemn melody as the casket was
j brought up the aisle on the shoulders of
| the stalwart members of the Capitol po
lice and placed on the bier prepared for
it in front of the pulpit. Following It
I came the pallbearers, members of the Sen
ate. After them came the family, the
widow and her son. the President, the
Cabinet dignitaries and intimate frlendi
. They all sat clcee around the casket. On
every side of it the floral offering* were
banked in a wealth of beauty and color.
The funeral services were opened by the
Rev. Dr. C. S. Shaw, who read a portion
j of the Nineteenth Psalm, verses 1. *>. 10
j and 12. This was followed by a selection
'. from Job, chapter xlv, verses 7-12. and
; concluded by a reading from the fifteenth
i chapter of Corinthians I. After a prayer
sixty male voices filled the church with
j the beautiful melody of 'â¢Nearer My God
1 to Thee."
After the sermon, In which the business,
i statesmanlike and social qualities of the
! deceased were extolled, the Orpheus Club
I sang a cantata by Chwatal. Dr. Magle
j then pronounced the benediction, and In
! the same order that it arrived the funeral
i procession left the church. As the casket
i was borne down the aisle and out on to
â  the porch the vest multitude, which could â 
| hardly be kept under control by the police j
! and soldiers, uncover- and when the
, President appeared with bowed head
! leaning on the arm of John Hay, there
was only a murmur of greeting.
Through long lines of thousands of un
covered heads the cortege wended its way
to Cedar Lawn Cemetery, where the body I
was placed In the receiving vault.
There were thirty-two pallbearers, eight
representing the United States Senate,
eight representing the House of Repre
eentatives, eight personal pallbearers pe
lected by Mr. Hobart two months before
his death and eight Senate police, who
carried tho casket.
The personal pallbearers were? Attorney
General Gripgs. Edward T. Bell, Franklin
Murphy. General Joseph W. Congdon,
Juiiso J. Franklin Fort i teorg E. Baker,
K. A. Walton and Coldnel William Har
boor.
The Pirate pallbearers were: William

McMillan of Michigan. John W. Danui or

A special train brought two companies
or artillery from Governors Island in com
man Â£. of Captain Lulgl and Captain T. ;
K. Adams. The batteries were received
by J. D. Hopper of the New Jersey volun
teers and escorted to the armory, where
breakfast was served. The companies
lined the short route of the funeral cor-
Re from Carroll Hall to the Church of
tne Redeemer, and later acted as escort
to the President and Cabinet.
The city wore Its most somber garb to
day in mourning. All the mills, big busi
ness houses and stores were closed. The
municipal buildings, banks and factories
looked gloomy in draperies of black and
purple On every hand were signs of
grief for the loss of New Jersey's states
man.
Out of deference to the wishes of Mrs.
Hobart there were no visitors this morn-
Ing to Carroll Hall except the Immediate
relatives of the family. The body of the
\ ico President rested In Its casket of oak
on the catafalque In the library. His right
hand rested lightly on his breast and held
a bunch of violets, placed there by the
w1 mOW.-.,.m OW .-.,. On the coffin was a bunch of
calla lilies, a sheaf of palm and some
smliaxard roses. Around thÂ» room were
many floral tributes, conspicuous among
them being several pieces from the White '
House conservatory.
There were never gathered In New Jer
sey, and seldom In any part of the United
States, so many mourners of eminence in
the nation. In the throngs were Senators
from States that were Territories before
the war and for years afterward. There
was Hoar of Massachusetts, representing
the old, and Beveiidge of Indiana, repre-
Eentinsr the new In national life. There
were John W. Daniel of Vlrslnla. repre
senting the Confederate soldiers, and
Hawley of Connecticut, standing as a type
of the union veteran, each of them to-day
as Senators mourning the loss of their
presiding officer. There was Jones of
Arkansas arm-in-arm with Frye of Main*.
Rom every State came men of broad cul
ture and prominence in national affairs
to honor the memory of the Illustrious
American, whose acknowledged ability
had won him a foremost place among men
of the time. More than three-fifths of th*
Senate and nearly half of the members of
the House of Representatives were In the
church, with the Governors of one-third
of the States.
Before the body arrived at the church
the members of the United States Senate
and House of Representatives, distin
guished men of States of the Union and
representatives of the legislature of New
Jersey and Supreme Court wore seated.
This left room only for the funeral party
i from the house.
The church floral decorations were mag
nificent. A band of smllax over three f*>et
wide and thick enough to hide the wall
ran around both sides and the front of
the main auditorium. Above the windows
the wreath ran unbroken before the pipes
of the great organ. At the windows plant
palms reached up to the emllax. These
j palms and the festooning around the win
dows were laden with white flowers, prin
cipally lilies of the valley, orchids and
i chrysanthemums. Around the organ and ]
the pulpit lilies were strewn In lavish pro
| fusion. The fonts before the pulpit were
covered with American beauty roees to
! the height of nine feet. A large space :
â  before the pulpit was left undecorated, I
where the casket rested, surrounded by
floral tributes.
The pew regularly occupied by the late
Vice President was filled with floral offer
ings.
WASHINGTON. Nov. -The special
train, bearing the President and members
of the Cabinet on their return from the
funeral of the late Vice President, arriv
ed here after 11 o'clock to-night. With
the President wore nil of the members of
the Cabinet, except the Attorney General,
who will remain In Pater* over Sunday,
and the Postmaster General and Secre
tary Long, who stopped over In Philadel
phia. On reaching the White House, the
President retired almost Immediately.
The Concessional train preceded that of
the President by half an hour.

Coryr!*btea. IXBI, by th. Associate Ptom.
BERLIN. Nov. 25 -ThÂ» visit of Emperor
WUJlajn to England, although more or
WÂ« discounted before hand, has occupied
public opinion this week above all else.
Even the most rabid Anglophobes found
little fault with the reports of his Majes
ty's reception. Some of the papers com
mented in a friendly way on the evidences
of Â«ood will and sympathy shown the
Emperor even by the lower classes of
EnsMsh and augured well therefrom a
J'.rmer and dearer understanding between
the two countries. It is significant that
one of Germany's noted professors pub
lishes a strong argument In favor of a
<>rman-Brltlsh-Aineiicaa alliance., while
Herr Barthe doe* the same. In the na
tion, howover. there Is no doubt that the
vast majority of the people and the press
continue hostile to Great Britain and dis
approve of the Imperial visit. A well
kno^n poet In the Pan-German Deutsche
7.Â«*!tur.g has written a poetic warning to
the Emperor beginning:
'Nach England Kaiser gehe ht."
Wnlle scores of papers have vented their
ar.O-Brltlsh feellnjrs sljrns are discernible
that opinion begins to veer.
Not only the Colojrr.e taastte which
naa been friendly to Oreat Britain from
the ttart, but even the lnfluwitlal Kreuz
Zeltur.gr. often the barometer of court
weather. and the lea.ilng Center organ.
the Colojme Yolks Zeitung. h&ve articles
this week confitrmnlng the. "senseless
raWd Anglophobia," the Kreua Zeitung
wayirg: "Opinion in Germany does not
strive against the re-^stablishment of bet
tor political and commercial relations
with England. On the contrary. It favors
both and believes there is room enough
on the globe for both nation* without
either obscuring the sunlight of the
other.**
The Cologne Yolks Zeitung ridicules the
"unreasonable Pan-Germans, saying they
woulfl hayÂ« Jubilated If the Emperor had
fona to fli Petersburg lnste-d of Eng
land."
The comment on the South African war
cnwally Is tinctured with ill will for
Gr^at Britain. The Deutsche Zeitung as
tumes the (success of tha Bo*ts anJ ad
vises President Krueer to insist, as to the
â¢Â«*rnis of peace, on the cession of Delogoa
ray to the Transvali. which. It adds, will
"lead to a new and better German policy
In South Africa."
The Deutsche Tajjes tone says: "If
the English press continues in us arro
tancy to represent England as the para
mount power and Germany as the vassal
In South Africa an Increase. If possible,
of the dislike felt here for our transchaa
cel cousins wl!l be the consequence."
Details of the Crar> visit to Potsdam
â¢re leaking out. The correspondents hero
ef the Associated Press learn from a per
son who tatis present that the Czar was
cool and reserved at first. Thi* was due
not or.ly to his natural disposition ar.d
abhorrence of scenes and painful Â«x
planations, but also to the fart that for
mmc time past ftories have been circu
lated by co-bÂ«*tweens at both courts of
Witnic remarks of the Emperor to the e-f
f>-<-t that *re Oz*x was a "Pantoffel" and
held to be avÂ»-rÂ»e to everything military,
end abont his "Spielerol ague confer
ence." alj cf which was reported to the
Czar In olftorlM shape*. Owing to this
the meeting was repeatedly put off and
only finally took place through the Influ
ence of the Cz.iiina. However, the Km-
I^ror's explsnatlons were Irresistible and
th* amlahllltv which he kr.cws so well

Kaiser Wllhelm Furnished
With American Food.
Upon instructions of a German phy-
Flciac, a case of Grape-Nuts Food was
lately sent by express to the German
Emperor. Kaiser Wllhelm, at Berlin.
This food has come Into recognition by
phypiclans as perhaps the moat perfect
form of nourishment In use.

cr twelve different operations, during:
â¢which the starch of the crams is turned
Into grape sugar.
The food is In Hhape of small gran-

â with glistening crystals of grape sugar

cÂ«-r*es and form out on the surface of

lain a "Insincere and provocative policy '"
Although expected, the burial of the!
antl-etrike bill came more swiftly than |
anticipated by either the Government or I
tne Reichstag. The collapse was due to
the conviction of the Centrists that their
amendments would not be accepted by
tne Government. The correspondent of
tne Associated Press learns that there is
no Intent! to Introduce another antl
boclalist bill at present. Emperor Wil
liam no Longer attaches the highest im
portance to an anti-strike bill, and even
the canal bill for a time has given way
to the naval bill, the passage of which
engrosses his thoughts. In the mean
while Count Posadowsky-Wehner. the
Minister of the Interior, and the Berliner |
Correspondenz. the special organ of the :
Oovernmenfs international policy, se
verely reprimanded the majority of the
Reichstag, which, on the rejection of the
bill, was made up of the entire L*ft. Cen- !
ter and Socialists. Because of their lack
of courtesy, the high otticials threaten I
that, as every bill designed to restrain or j
repress Socialists Is defeated, the Govern
ment win have to find other means to ac
complish this end. as It : .- claimed to be
necessary to curb the growing Insolence i
iof the Socialists. The Government otll- I
: cials also say plainly that there Is no in
tention of redeeming Prince â  June's
promise to enlarge the right of political
coalition throughout Germany until the
Reichstag has passed measures to guard
against, the "growing abuse of the right i
of coalition among the laboring classes."
The press overwhelmingly rejoices at
the defeat of the bill. The \ orwaerts I
cays: â â¢win the Government learn? Can j
Internal things continue as at present? I
The chasm between the Government and |
the people become wider and wider. The !
Go\'ernment fears an appeal to the elec
tor. What will the Government do?
, What but a coup d'etat Is ft?"
The moderate Boersen Courier says:
"The attempt to curtail the best right
of the working classes has been defeated.
We hope the lesson will not lm lost upon
high personages. Why did the Govern
ment not know better?"
The Cologne Yolks Zeitung pays: "Now
that the anti-strike bill is out of the way,
the â¢lew naval bill will have a turn."
. Another influential organ mainly blames
the Cabinet, which, it v\s. ought never
to have acted on one of the Emperor's :
postrrannl.il speeches.
Before starting for England Emperor i
William was Prince Hohenlohe's guest.
j The Prince assured him that the adoption
of the naval bill by the Reichstag was ;
certain, without having recourse to dras
tic measures, at which the Emperor re-
I Joiced. Prince I -iilohe is now again
tirmly in fuvor.
The reply of the. Empress of Germany to j
the Benin Municipal Council's birthday â¢
congratulations is still much discussed.
j not only in Rerlln. but throughout Ger
| many, it appears that the letter was |
| written at the dictation of the Emperor. |
, The points raised by the letter are old and
j refer to the question of the city's church
patronage and contributions to church '
| funds, but It is generally believed that the ;
; reason the letter was couched In offensive
i terms was that the Emperor prefers open
| war â¢ ) the latent hostility long exlstant t
| between himself and the Council, which Is j
composed of his political opponents and a
I goodly proportion of Socialists like Herr
j blnger, or outspoken Democrats like Pro- I
fessor Vlrchow. It is said the Emperor |
wrongly construed the apparently servile j
tone of the Council's address. Only onÂ©
leading paper Bides with the Emperor in
1 this quarrel. Even such conservative or-
i gans as the Kreuz Zeitunf and Post
] guardedly intimate tha< ncr Majesty's re
i ply was in bad taste and ungracious.
At the Emperor's instance Baron yon
I Mlrbach. master of the household of the
I Empress, alpo wrote to the Senate of the
j Berlin University disapproving of the Sen
ate's attitude In the Aarons and Preuss
cases a;.d demanding their dismissal.
The correspondent of the Associated i
I Press learns that the Emperor adheres to
I his Intention to curtail Berlin self-gov
i ernment. His Majesty recently remarked
! that there was no reiison why two mil
i lions of â¢-liners should have more polltl
! cal Independence than tho same number
of We6tphallans and Hanoverians, and he
fears that If the movement is not checked, ,
Berlin will become the hotbed of revolu- !
l tlon. like Paris.
The Cameroon! scandal Is to be over
hauled by the Reichstag during the dis
cussion 01 the budget in December.
The movement in favor of German
cables is growing. The correspondent of
the Associated Press learns that beside*
a direct cable to New York, now under
j way. the Government proposes soon to !
i lay one to the German colonies In Africa,
I via the ... a terminus at Swak
i cpmund. Thence the lino will cross Ger- â 
I man East Africa, touching at Togo, in
' the Cameroons.
The Kreuz "unir says: "One lesson;
J which Germany has learned from the ,
I present war Is that we must have an Af- :
rican cable of our own. Perhaps it is
possible to combine In the matter with
some other power, say France."
Many complaints appear in the papers
1 regarding the British cable service to and
i from Africa since the war began. A i
! number nf firms have complained to
Prince Hoher.i and have asÂ«e<l him to
obtain damages from Great Britain. The
press Is a unit in advocating Independent :
German cables.
The Government is on the point of
making another attempt to exclude for- :
eign fruit wholly, or partly, from Ger
many, and Is collecting information from
dealers as to whether such oxcluMon la l
feasible without causing a stringency In
the market.
Baron yon Hertling, leader of the Cen-
I ter party, has gone to Rome to obtain i
I Instructions from the Vatican regarding

charÃcd with battery by his wife. He do
clsred he had done nothing, but that hid
wife had pulled his whiskers and other
wise abused him. Mrs. Breyer relented
of her conduct on Wednesday and paid
the costs and had the charge dismissed.
Yesterday she had recorded a deed to
their home at 579 North San Pedro street
and adjoining property, whereby Breyer
had deeded It to her.
Breyer now declares that *he obtained
the deed fraudulently from him, and to
day he began suit to have it set aside
The property in question is worth several
thousand dollars. Breyer alleges he exe
cuted the deed to his wife- in September,
IMC, but with the distinct understanding
it was not to bo recorded until after his
death. He aPÃorts Fhe will now appro
priate the rents and profits of the place,
and he asks for an injunction preventing
her from doing so. It Is also asked that
the deed be canceled.
It Is said tiat papers are also being pre
pared by which Breyor will sue his wife
for a divorce. The couple were married
In Pennsylvania In itM and have two
frown sons.

OUR DISAPPEARING FORESTS.
NOW that public attention has been directed to
the rapid destruction of our forests evidence of
the waste is perceived on every side. From ail
portions of the Union come reports of the danger
that threatens. In the lake States it is noted that
the big forests of white pine, once considered inex
haustible, are now so near gone it is believed Michi
gan and Wisconsin will no longer be able to furnish
the supply expected from them, and that Minnesota
uiil within a year or two have to meet nearly the
whoic demand for that kind of limber. I: that be so
it will nut be long before the Minnesota pineries mil
be exhausted nnleÂ«s the steps now taken to conserve
thrm be carried out on a comprehensive scale,
Pro:'esÂ«or Fcrnow of the National Department of
Agriculture has recently directed attention to the fact
jhat the figures given concerning our forests are mis
leading, inasmuch as a large portion of that area has
been burned over or in other ways deprived of woods.
According to the records we have j50.000.000 acres of
forest sgamst 490.000.000 acres in Russia and 46,000,
000 in Austria, but the professor says: "It is well
known to everybody who is acquainted with our for
ests that they cannot compare in yield with the aver
age European Continental forests under systematic
roanrqrmcr.t. Much of what is reported as forests iÂ«
useless brash land, or open woods, and depredate in
its capacity for wood production by annual fires, by
which the physical structure of the leaf mold is de
â¢troyed, and thus, too, its capacity for storing need
ful moisture, reducing wood production and killing
all young growth."
We have here another statement from an official
authority of the urgent importance of a comprehensive
supervision and protection of our forest lands. It is
by no means to our credit tliat countries supposed to
be so backward when compared to the United States
as Russia and Austria are making more profit out of
their forests than we out of ours and at the same
rime preserving them while we m destroying ours.
The problem is one we cannot afford to overlook,
and sooner or Inter we must deal with it on a com
prehensive scale and in a scientific manner.
THANKSGIVING IN fILfISKfI.
SOME very lively comment has been forth
coming from' captious critics concerning the
terms in jvhich several Governors have followed
the President in calling upon the people to observe
nrxt Thursday as a day of thanksgiving and rejoicing.
In the proclamation of Governor Roosevelt of New
York, for example, it has been noted that the name
of the Almighty does not appear, so that doubts are
expressed whether thanks for prosperity in that State
are to be given to the Governor or to the farmer who
raises the turkeys.
:: hr Greeted against the lan
r.ra'ly. Governor of Alaska. His
â¢ - â¢ anks for about
| that makes up the Alaskan environment,
ng the n. r the snow. Hie C, - ov
â 
"We, here in Alaska, have good reason for render-
Ins praise and thanksgiving to Almighty God. We
rejoice with our friends and relatives in the States
that they have been blest with abundant harvests
and that they are enjoying â  period of wonderful pros
perity. We arc thankful th.it Alaska is a Land of
Promise. Here God has gendered the treasures of
â¢now and hail. The dust of fine gold has he strewn
over the valleys, aye even over the strands of the sea,
and many hundreds have been rewarded for their toiL
He has made veins in the mountains for the precious
oreÂ«. The earth Rives forth iron and coal, and the
very stones yield their share of copper. Grass and
mo<s have not failed, and the Ma has bountifully en
riched m from its stores. Surely we can rejoice with
thanksgiving.
Now if Alaskans can give thanks for the treasures
of mow and hail, surely we can give them even more
r.bundantly for the blessings of our climate, for we
have snow and hail in the mountains and sunshine
in the valleys. We lark not golden sands, nor moss,
for the gold is brought forth by the enterprising and
the mojs gathers on the backs of the Silurians. With
Ateska, therefore, we can have full sympathy, and
fince they are to rejoice that we have had abundant
l:nrv-cÂ«ts we can rejoice that they live in a land of
promise. Between ourselves and the Alaskans there
is indeed the triple bond of country, of kinship and
of business relations. By each of those ties our pros
perity is bound up with theirs, and it will add much
to the rejoicing here to know that they have so much
to be thankful for up there.
THE CUBAN PROBLEM.
THE campaign of education designed to bring
the American people up to the understanding
that the benevolent assimilation of Cuba to the
United States is a part of the white man's burden
i imposed upon us by divine providence goes on apace.
: It will be in full blast by the time Congress gets ready
to consider our relations to the Cubans, and its lead
ers will be prepared with abundant testimony to show
first that the people of the island are unfit for a re
an form of government, and second that they
will make good citizens of the United States.
General Ludlow in a recent address before the New
York Chamber of Commerce is reported to have
said: "The present generation will have to pass away
before the Cubans can form a stable government." A
free Cuba would soon become a second Hayti ac
cording to his judgment, and we must out of respect
for the welfare of the island continue to exercise su
pervision and authority there.
The problem involved in the situation is that at
present we are occupying Cuba as a military posses
sion. Is it an independent state or a subject province?
Practically it is an island without a government, and
such law as prevails is that which our armies enforce.
What form of government is to follow the military
regime? If we intend a free Cuba we have no right
to organize a civil government for the island as a
part of the United States; on the other hand, if we
intend to annex it the sooner we provide for it some
form of civil administration the better. The Cubans
no doubt like us very well and have no desire to re
sist our troops by insurrection, but it is not in the
nature of any people to be long satisfied with military
rule, and consequently if we are to keep peace in the
island it will be necessary to come to some conclusion
about the government at once.
The annexationists are not agreed as to the course
which should be pursued in the matter. Some of them
favor a continuance of the military government,
partly because that will keep the problems of the
island out of the arena of Congressional discussion
and thus enable the annexation movement to go along
silently until the fact is accomplished. On the other
hand, some of the more ardent among them would
like Congress to establish a civil government in the
isbnd at once, because such action would imply that
has become a part of our nation and is subject
to our legislation.
It will be well for the American people to give hr e ;l

fl BOOM FOR SULZER.
S I*I.7 RR of New York has been lifted up before
the public as Tammany's candidate for the
Sj.eakership of the House of Representative,.
It il : â¢ ' â¢ â¢ ira to Snlzer, to Tammany and to
c world that he cannot be elected, but he may
c Democratic nomination, and that would carry
lership oi the Democratic party in the
l!ouÂ«e, with such small honors and emoluments v
may attach to that position.
The boom, we are told, mi branched in New '
' r ' ' ' â¢ 'Klit, in v.
Richard Cl (ward Murphy, all the Democratic
c State and a host of other digiii
rty were present. Cr<>ker acted as toon

Hou^t of Repre-ent.itives and of hit fidelity to Wil
liam J. Bryan. The other participants in the fea^t
'â¢r's lead and it was a right of glory
for Subrr.
The New York candidate trill find some strong
rivals to* contest with him the honor of the leadership
to which he aspires. Bailey of Texas is out of the
field, but, nevertheless, the South has three candidates
for the placeâ Bankhead of Alabama, DeArmond of
Missouri and Richardson of Tennessee. Each of
these has apparently a better chance than Sulzcr, for
the Democratic Representatives in this Congress are
.nostly from the Southern States, and therefore a
Southern man is likely to be chosen. Tammany, how
ever, is very good at political management, and it is
laid that before setting up a candidate of their own
for the place the Tammany leaders made a canvass
of the Democrats of the House and found they have
a good chance to win.
As a candidate Sulzer will represent straightout
Bryanism. Croicer did not in any way misrepresent
his record when he described Sulzer as I faithful fol
lower of the Nebraska orator and the free silver star.
In the days when Tammany itself was opposed to free
silver Sulzer stood up manfully for the Chicago plat
form. If, then, the three-cornered fight among the
Southerners result in hopeless divisions, the New
York man may win, and Sulzer will be in his glory.
So far as practical politics is concerned it can mat
ter little who is chosen to lead the Democrats in this
Congress. They will have but little to do in shaping
legislation, nor is it likely that anything their leader
can do in the House will have influence on the issues
before the country in the coming Presidential election.
There is, in truth, no genuine leadership in cither of
the candidates for the office of nominal leader. As
a contest between Tammany and the South, how
ever, the movement to elect Sulzer will be more or
less interesting and may be watched with some amuse
ment in all parts of the country.
A litigant in the local courts testified the other day
that he needs at least $700 a month to live. He prob
ably did not wish to impress upon the court that his

BRITISH WflÃ INSURANCE RISKS.
AMONG the persons who study the reports of
the battles in South Africa with most care
and who exercise the greatest efforts to obtain
exact returns are the great insurance companies with
whom British officers insure their lives before goinf?
fo the front With these men the lists of killed and
wounded are interesting as matters of business, for it
is from them that calculations are made as to what
rate shall be charged for war risks.
Tables have been recently published by London
insurance journals giving the results of the informa
tion they have obtained of the casualties at the three
battles of Dundee, Elandslaagte and Reitfotitein.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL,, SUNDAY, NOVEMBER 26. 1599.
Of these it is said that in the fight at Dundee out of
45<A3 men exposed on the British side 215 were killed
and wounded. Percentage of officers killed to 193
engaged was 5.18; percentage of officers wounded to
those engaged was 11. q*. Altogether 17.10 per cent of
the officers engaged were either killed or wounded.
In the battle of Hlandslaagte 257 were killed or
wounded out of 3605 engaged. Of these thirty-five
1 re officers. At Reitfontetn, with a total strength of
4356. ioS men were killed and wounded. As regards
the three battles, with 387 officers and 13.000 men
about the fighting line, 75 casualties (1937 per cent)
were reported among the officers. Among the men
505 casualties (387 per cent) were reported, 79 prov
ing fatal. Total killed and wounded, 580, or 4.33 per
cent.
All of these battles occurred in October, and the
reports from them had therefore been fairly well
authenticated by the time the tables were made up.
There is reason to believe the later battles have been
even more disastrous to the British. The argument
of the insurance men is designed to justify an increase
in the rate of insurance for officers, against which
there appears to have been raised something of a
protest. It has been asserted that it is unpa
triotic on the part of the companies to take advantage
of the war to make big profits, but in answer the
London Review, speaking for the insurance men,
says:
"Patriotism sounds yen- well, but unless ship
owners let their ships go for less money than they
would in time of peace, contractors charge less for
war material, and mules are purchased for less than
peace prices, and unless in every respect Roods he
come cheaper, it is absurd to expect joint-stock life
insurance companies, as regards their shareholders
and thHr civilian policy-holders, or mutual life offices.
aa regards the vast bulk of thrir policy-holders alone,
to present army officers substantially with a larpe
bonus. But it is a fact that life insurance companies
ft never made any protit on the extra premiums
on ofiicers" policies, and that they do not care about
taking new ones at all except at prohibitory rates. On
the 5 per cent increase taken as the general average
charge we have been able to show that there is every
prospect of the offices losing heavily. This can
hardly be called want of patriotism."
It is also asserted by the insurance men that British
officers expose themselves too much, partly to en
courage their men, partly through pride and partly
from a desire to distinguish themselves and win pro
motion. That, however, is a statement hardly per
tinent to the issue, unless it should be the intention
to charge daring officers a higher rate than cautious
ones.
After a financial policy which has found expression
in a persistent refusal for years John \V. Mackay Ins

will have to explain in court the secret of the r1"r 1 "

DEMOCRACY AND THE BRYON SHIRT.
\A ARYLAND Democrats. Bashed by their re
/ \ cent victory in the State election, have come
forth with their Governor-elect. John \\
Smith, at their head, to renew the effort to ri-J
Democracy of Bryanism. (iornian is reported to In
a supporter of the movement and is quoted as I
stated to a friend that a sufficient number of anti-
Bryan <ir!egates would be lent to the next national
I convention to prevent the tree silver man from Retting
the two-thirds vote necessary t<>r a nomination.
We have heard much of that kind of talk before.
Last winter the asr was full of it. Anti-Rryan move
ments started in the East and swept up and down thai
section of the country about as frequent and Hi
furious .-is blizzards. They vanished, however, like
i - OWI that blizzards bring. The great Democratic
banquets on Jackson's day and Jefferson's day that
were to have been marked by the elimination of
Bryan from the Den ocrat horizon resulted in quite
a different showing, and the famous $10 fea<t of the
dignitaries at Tammany Hall was eclipsed by the
dollar dinner where Bryan shone and waved his silver
t tonÃiic.
We shall believe that M rjrland can organire a
movement to beat Bryan when we perceive the man
1 whom she is to mit up against him rally a force big
I enough to make a in the pen. Re-
I ports made to friends of arrangements to elect to the
convention a sufficient number of ami- Bryan dele
gates to beat him are too vague to be taken seriously.
: The fight against him now is not so strong as it was
last year, f'.r now Tammany has gone over to his side
and no desertions from him of note have been re
corded.
It is of course humiliating to intelligent Democrats
to have the party committed to the leadership of such
a man as Bryan, but so long as the masses and the
bosses wish him it is not easy to see how the intel
ligence of the party is to get rid of him except by
beating him so badly in the coming election that he
will never be heard of again.
It will hardly do to compare the effect of Rryanism
npon Democracy to the- shin of Nessos, for the Greek
tale is too tragic, and besides the simile is so worn
that the shirt itself is threadbare. There is a Xew
England shirt story of the day that fits the
ca<e better. Tt is narrated that one Hiram
Clark, an enterprising resident of Watertown,
Mass., recently devised a one-piece, rubber-lined cot
ton undergarment which was intended to be water
proof. He expected to make a fortune by the sale
of the same to miners, seafaring men and others
whose vocations are pursued in damp or wet places
Unfortunately for Clark, however, when he donned
the new garment and submitted it to a hmt test the
rubber lining melted and stuck to his body so that
the fabric was only removed with the aid of" a pair of
scissors and a scraping knife, and with great pain
to the wearer.
That is about the way the BryanitC shirt is sticking
to Democracy. The thing can be removed with scis
sors and a scraping knife, but it will be with great
pain to the wearer. Moreover, it will require some
body to hold the pationt down while the scraping is
going on. and we doubt the ability of Maryland to
I do it
A German Count, who was commissioned by his
Emperor to follow the American troops through the
! Cuban war for purposes of observation, has concluded
his task with the announcement that the American
' militia system always was and always will be a mys
tery to him. If he could only see our illuminated
Adjutant General Seamans onlrring uniforms what a
flood of light would be thrown on the subject!
The Riverbank capitalist who invested his entire for
tune in a ditch and now hasn't even the ditch to show
for it probably is convinced that there are holes
enough in the ground in which to lose money without
digging new ones.
Judging from the persistency with which the Boer*
continue to shell the British positions, it is natural *o
assume that they take them for peas.

itor in H.s IsSUfl Of thr. lMh thought tH to
reproduce â  scurrilous attack made In the
Northwestern Catholic upon catholic
rhaplams in sjaiieial an<l upon myself in
particular. The attack is given great
prominence, and the Northwestern is
called tv the Monitor Its "esteemed" con
temporary. I infer therefore that thÂ« edi
tor of the Monitor found In the North
western words that voiced his sentiments,
and that he for th;u reason transcribed
them and gave them In his paper the
same prominence they occupied In his
mind.
1 thought nt to replyâ not because of the
Monitor but because of the base Insinua
tions contained In the article. I did reply,
and my reply has drawn from the payer
In Its Issue of the 25th an article .ipon
which I feel bound In justice to myself
and to my lriemls to comment. The Moni
tor makes the following Htatements:
Firstâ That it did not make the charge
I protested against. , â¢â â â¢â 
second -That Father McKlnnon told
Mrs. Funston she might accept a rubs
stolen from one of the churches.
Thirdâ Father McKlnnon la not
justified In dcnylnsf the charges made
against General Metcalf.
Fourthâ That Father' McKinnon Insists
that the American army is not In thÂ»j
slightest degree responsible for these out
rages (the looting and desecration of
churches;.
Fifthâ That Father McKlnnon Justifies
the soldiers in taking and keeping stolon
articles, because they got them from
Chinese looters.
Sixthâ And lastly, the editor of the Mon
itor asks Father McKinnon whether he
made any attempt to use the authority
given him in order to prevent the soldiers
taking home church property got In such
wise.
1 reply seriatim.
I. The editor of the Monitor denies he
made the charge I protested against. I

quoted article reads as follows. The

CHARTER POINTS DISCUSSED.
George D. Squires* Answer to Henry N. Clement.
To the Editor of The Call: In attempt
ing: to construe the civ;! service provi
sions of the new charter in my letter to
you the ether day I had no idea that I
v.as making a personal attack on Mr. 11.
N. Clement, member of the Civil Service
Committee of tho Board of Freeholders
and candidate for Civil Bervlos Commis
sioner at the hands of Mayor Phelan. It
appears, however, from the tone of his
communication published yesterday that
ho considers this civil service business his
aflalr entirely. The promptitude with
which he h:ts sprung the Nevada style
of controversy upon me leaves no other
Conclusion than that ho does not Inter. d
to brook Interference with it uy anybody.
My purpose in addressing you, however,
was nut as Mr. Clement thinKS, 10 con
solo the "push ' though, being the bot
tom dug* in this affair, 1 do not grudge
them ail the consolation they can got out
of my view of. tho lawâ but to uncover
the person or persons responsible lor Die
civil service faux pas of tut new chartor.
This purpi has been accomplished. Mr.
Clement huÂ« promptly avowed himself
the author of the Letch by attempting to
defend It. Buch being the case, it is- to
bo hoped that he will drop the Nevada
style of argument and proceed to Â«'labo
rate a theory of construction by which
the civil service provisions of the new
charter can be made to apply to appoint
ment!) conferred by the heads of the d v
government on January a. it is no
answer to my argument to su.Â«pec; my
devotion to civil service reform or im
pungo my motives.
The clausu of section 10, article XIII,
quoted by .Mr. Clement does not prove his
case. It has no application whatever to
It. Either he has not read article XI II
lately or he is unable to give legal effect
to the language used in it. Like all the
other sections of article XIII, Mctioa 10
applies to the CLASSIFIED service pro
vided by the charter. 1 defy Mr. Clement to
show by any rational method of reason-
Ing that any of the civil service provisions
ot the new charter apply to any service
except the "classified' 1 service. The Com
missioners are given authority over no
other service and they can grant permis
sion to appoint without examination only
to that service.
What, then, is the true construction of
article XIII? Manifestly it sets op
a system of rules whereby applicants
shall be examined and appointed after
classification. No intelligent person, let
alone â  lawyer, will, after subjecting ar
ticle XIII to the test of reason, contend
that any other construction can be placed
upon it.
If Mr. Clement will read tho article he
will discover that the very first duty im
posed upon the Civil Service Commis
sioners after appolntemeni la to "classi
fy all the places of employment in or un
der the otlkes and departments of the
city and county mentioned in section li
of this article, with reference to the ex
aminations hereinafter provided for."
(Sec. 2.) The places so classified shall
constitute the civil service of the city
and county, and no appointment to any
such places shall be mads except ac
cording to the rules of the commission.
How can the commission grant permis
sion In case of emergency to make tem
porary appointments to any other than
the classified service? If the charter nad
said In terms that for the purpose of
putting into effect the provisions with
respect. Â»o a classified civil service the
commission might on the first Mm lay
after the first day of January. IM
grant permission to make temporary ap
pointments the case would have been dif
ferent. But it does not say so. In fact
it says the very opposite, as I have .1
lustrated.
The difficulty with Mr. Clement is that
he Is unfamiliar with the rules of statu
tory construction. He thinks ho haa
made a system which covers the
point I have raised, but he has not
done so, and I will venture to say that
when his work comes to be reviewed by
the courts, as It certainly will be, they
will point out to him that he has neg
lected to rrake provision for giving retro
active effect to his civil service rules.
It la plain that article XIII Is prospect
ive In its operation. First, the Civil Ser
vice Commission Is appointed; then it
classifies the service; then it makes rules;
then it publishes notice for two weeks
that it is about to hold examinations
then, having accumulated a stock of civil
service material. it honors requisitions
from public officials. The government
however, cannot await the perfecting of
this oronasi. it must *o on. The Civil
Filipinos for military purposes some time
before the United States troops arrived.
The church had been thoroughly secular
ized and the natives had stripped it of
everything of value. After the American
troops occupied it somebody discovered a
garment alleged to have been part of the
raiment of a statue of the virgin and
presented it to Mrs. Funston. Father
McKlnnon of the California volunteers
told her there was no Impropriety in her
accepting It, and consequently she kept
It. That is all there Is to the story of
desecration.' " .. , ,
The story Is a lie. I never authorized
any one on an] occasion to retain any
article of church property. How this as
sertion, came out in the Detroit paper I
don't know: nor am 1 much concerned.
One thing I am sure of, though, is that
Father Reaney never made the state
ment. Perhaps there are editors In De
troit, as well as In San Francisco, who
to establish their own pet theories would
neither stop at garbling and misrepre
senting the statements of a priest, nor at
giving unwarranted reliance to the asser
tions of a scoundrel. But. however ob
tained, It is a lie. and the Monitor In re
producing such base insinuations shows
an animus consistent perhaps with yel
low Journalism, and perhaps consistent
with the present editor's Ideas of what
the Catholic organ of San Francisco
should be The paper was not formerly
bo conducted and I am mistaken If the
Catholic people desire that the Monitor
fall from the position and dignity it here
tofore occupied.
111. With regard to the General Metcalf
incident I refer your readers â¢â â¢ the unim
peachable testimony of reliable witnesses
in Wednesday's and Thursday s dally
papers. There they will find thai the of
ficial Investigation ordered by Major Gen
eral Mac Arthur entirely exonerates Gen
eral Met< from any connection with the
affair. Not only this, but the man on
whose authority the affidavit mentioned'
was made admits that, like the Monitor's
friend Fox, he was drunk and did not
know what he was doing when he was
Induced to sign same.
IV. Concerning the question of church
looting the tdltor of the Monitor says that
I "emphatically stated that the American
army Is not in the slightest uegree re
sporiHlblo for these outrages." This Is
exactly my proposition. This was my
statement from the beginning, and this
I still maintain. I did not deny that loot-
Ing had been done. This I admitted. Till*
every one knows. But, as i fald before,
the American Government Is not responsi
ble.
At the very beginning of the war strict
orders were Issued by all the govern
mental authorities that defaulters In this
respect would be dealt with most severely.
The necessary provisions were made that
this command would not be violated. The
generals of the respective brigades were
warned and they in turn warned those
under them.
I was delegated by the different com
manders under whom I served to see that
no desecration took place. Immediately
upon entering a captured town I went to
the church, took an Inventory of every
thing left by the insurgents and ChinesÂ©
looters, had these articles stor-.d away in
the sacristy and locked and sealed the
door of same, then placed a guard over
the church to see that the seal would not
be broken. It Is needless to say that it
never was.
Now, unless the editor of the Monitor
can prove that the American Government
did not do all that could be reasonably
expected in order that the laws might be
observed, he makes an unwarranted asser
tion when he says that the American
authorities were responsible. In fact, so
unwarranted is It that, though like the
donkey mentioned In the editor's fable of
this Issue, he wishes to appear as a lion,
he brays like the other animal.
Now. can he prove that the American
officers In the Philippines did not do thftlr
utmost to see that these laws were ob
served? He cannot. He has made an ef
fort to do so. Week after week he has
filled the pases of the Monitor with the
assertions of men who were as remark
able for their want of veracity as they
were for their wnnt of common sense and
decency. Wf-k after week he has given
one lame argurrent after another to sub
stantiate his own theories about the Phi!-
Service Commission cannot grant anyÂ»
body permission to make temporary ap
pointments to any but the classlnea ser
vice, and the service of the city will not
be classified on January b. Hence of ne
cessity the heads of departments will have
to make appointment* under the general
powers given them by the. charter.
How can the Civil Service Commission
force persons who get their appointments
in this way to appear and take the exam
inations? Hew can It force officials to
make requisitions when there are no va
cancies? An office in a certain sense la
property. It Is a right to draw a salary
and a ma: cannot be .rived of It ex
cept by due process of law. Mr. Clcrn
rnt may 'iilnk he ought to be deprived ol
It In such a case as he Imagine*, but
he will find. 1 opine, that his thinker
will not amount to much in a legal con
test.
Mayor Fhelan may be able to enforce
Mr. Clei IS view of article XIII on the
boards and commissions which he will
appoint, since the charter empowers him
to remove any person at will; but noth
ing can be done with the officials elect
ed on November 7 except to persuade
them. I know enough about political hu
man nature and the "pulls" of the
"push," however, to hazard the prediction
that few of them will be persuaded.
re !s one othÂ«T point In this matter
which may be now to Mr. Clement, and
although I have already consumed too
much space, 1 hop* \ou will permit mo to
advance It for his benefit. If he Is |
come a Civil Service Commissioner ne
will probably later or; I â  r it lor him
sell
I do not believe that any person ?p
polnted <>n January & in the manner out
lined, however, will be entitled to the

All appointments made prior to th%
classification of the service, therefore.,
WOUld be subject to the pleasure of the
appointing power and would continue to
be unprotected by this provision until
made under the rules. If, after the com
mission baa accumulated a sufficient
quantity of civil service material to sup
ply the demand, the head of each depart
ment should discharge his men crraduallt
and fill their positions by requisition, all
places might be brought under the rules.
Hut if Mr. Clement has any Idea that this
will be lone he is living In a fool's para
dise. The "push" was not born yester
day and an office Is a good thing. Very
respectfully,

Even admitting that the editor of tn*
Monitor could show that there were a few
cases of looting, what would this prove?
Would it prove that the American Gov
ernment failed in Its duty? By no means
Every reasonable man knows that In w.r
many things occur that are lamentahiÂ«
and disastrous. Hence It might easily
happen that an exceptional case of looting
might occur evÂ«n In the best discipline
armies and un<! the strictest rules. To
deny this the editor of the Monitor wou.rj
make himself as ridiculous in his meffcoi,
of reasoning as he has made himself no
torious for accepting the testimony of low
characters.
V. When one wishes to misunderstand he
can do so. Apparently the editor of thu
i Monitor wishes to misunderstand aie
That were of little consequence did hÂ« not
undertake to misrepresent me to th.j
Catholic people by stating that I Justified
men In keeping stolen goods merely be
cause they got them from Chinese louteri
Calm readers will Judge such statement*
for themselves and will Judge the Moni
tor. too. What I did say was that the
soldiers could come In possession r,f 4
great many ecclesiastical article without
having looted churches to get U.*m. For
the Instruction of the people Ut me ailil
that while some of the towns w*rÂ«- bum-
Ing stores In which church supplies wtrÂ«
sold were often among the buildings de
stroyed. Men could find hÂ»rr rjuantlt>i of
every article used In Catholic worship
and therefore we are not to conclude from
the presence of articles of this kind that
th.- looting of churches was rither whole
1 sale or general as the agitators rt-pretÂ«nt
It to be.
VI. To the editor's last question as to
why Father McKlnnon made no effort to
exercise the power he claim* to have had
to take church prop* whfrrver found?
1 Why he did not exercise it on th* soMlfrs
who were bringing ho many stolen vest
ments and chalices to San Francisco?
Simply because he did not know of ar.y
such articles In their possession. I nÂ«vÂ»r
saw any. and the agitation concerning
them was started after my departure for
thÂ© East. I never even heard about thlÂ»
agitation till the editors of some of th-Â»
Eastern Catholic papers told me how tM
article written on the authority of Fox
that subsequently appeared In DonohoÂ»"i
Magazine had bÂ»en peddled about amonc
the editor* of Eastern Catholic Journals
looking for a buyer.
The editor of the Monitor speak* of
Inconsistencies and contradictions In ir.v
lecture. We are not surprised to hear him
making such an assertion after wttnes*ln*
all the Inconsistencies and contradictions
in his recei editorial. We have se*n how
he denied that in a previous edltlor. h*
made or sanctioned the assertion that
some Catholic priests were hirelings of
the administration. We have seen how
little authority he had for asserting that
I told Mrs. Funston she might accept a
robe stolen from one of the churches. We
have seen how weak was his contention
when he said I was not Justified In deny-
Ing the charges made against General
Metcalf. We have seen how untrust
worthy and unreliable were the state
ments he made concerning the respon
sibility of the American Government for
the looting and desecration of church**.
We have seen how he forgot to tell th->
truth when he asserted that I Justified the
soldiers in taking and keeping articles be
cause They got them from Chinese loot
ers. We have seen all the contradictions.
Inconsistencies and false statements, and
now all fair-minded readers can draw
' their own conclusions.
One word more to the editor. As %
Christian gentleman, as editor of the San
Francisco Monitor, especially as successor
of a great and learned and true man. th*
public expect more from you than from
the ordinary Individual While trying to
recall a little bit of advice. I cannot think
of any more appropriate to the man or
the occasion than that contained In the
first words of th* moral In the fable of
the donkey and th* lion, which appear*
In your last Issue. R#nd these words an<l

It is understood that the United States,
Great Britain and Japan have already ar
rived at a perfect understanding. Ger
many's decision was greatly Iniluen.-ed
by tiie Emperor, who had frequent con.'er
ences on mis Far Eastern problem while j
in England with Joseph H. Choale, United i
Suites Embassador. At the Queen's ban- j
<iuÂ»-t Mr. Choute conversed at length with ]
the Emperor and it is said chiefly ccn- \
fined himself to the question of China. It
'.3 scarcely probable that any oflicial or
sÂ«'nil-offlcial reference will be made to !
this Impovtant undercurrent which pro
gresses publicly under the guise of mere
ly giving rssurances to the United States
until it has assumed such t-hapo that no
hitch is possible.. In the event of the
failure of the negotiations through tne
refusal of Russia or Germany It Is likely
tlie world will never know how near thÂ«
great powers came to settling the great

The Transvaal war becomes a matter

Tremendous possibilities dependent on
these exertions which are now occupying I
the diplomats of Europe, and the war '
itself has reached a stage where even
British interest Fomewhat Hags. The ad
vance of the troops to the relief of Lady-
Fmtth, Kimberley and Mafeking is neces
sarily clothed in secrecy, which Is only
broken by the news of desultory engage
ments. The past week seems to have al
tered but little the conditions described in
these dispatches. Even If General White
holds out until relieved it will only re
move a picturesque phase of the campaign
and does not mean that It will hasten Its
end. The Boers, It Is claimed. are- not
likely to risk the deciding battle of the
war until they have got Bullor*B In
vading force Into a position believed to
be favorable to them or until they are
driven into a corner, which promises to
be a matter of months.
The criticism of the methods of the
British army organization has led several
writers to again seriously consider the
advisability of adopting some form of con
scription, but. although a preponderance
of military experts might favor such a
step, the British nation has not yet
reached that stage where it could submit
to such militarism.

SUNSET LIMITED
SOON TO START
Will Open the Season
Friday, Dec. 15th.
At a conference of Southern Pacific
â¢ â¢ '.ay the campaign
of th- â¢ flyer, Sunset Limited.
was definitely determined for the com
ing season. It is to enter upon its sixth
year of service between this city and
New Orleans on Friday, December 15,
and continue twice a weekâ Tuesdays
an.l Fridaysâ until about the first of
April.
Not only Callfornlans, but all who
are interested in California, East and
West, will greet this announcement
with delight, for Sunset Limited has
won a secure abiding place in the af
ns of all who travel between the
East and 'â â 
i-es much to the credit
of this remarkable train. When it was
first stair. .'4, it Illumined the
tinent with llaming
tied every one
with ant promises. That
everything said of it has been exceeded
In th- â  promise more
history, and its
' to it with pride.

almost â¢ to rearh. The or.
: â¢ tting hfre was little less to
ided than were their fearful win
ters.
When Sunset Limited proved to them
that they could reach the sunny slopes
and tronical groves of the far West,
surrounded by luxuries difficult even to
imagine and without discomforts of
climate or travel, a new world was
opened. The South Is less talked about
now; so Is Europe, and California has
felt the Increase like the infusion of
new, warm, life-giving blood.
Sunset Limited had everything In its
favor as against all sorts of rivalry,
and the result was not to be wondered
at. Added to the matchless eleganc*
of its service was a delightful Journey
of several thousand miles along the
southern borderland of the nation,
where It is always sunshine, always
cheerful and the sources of entertain
ment ns varied and novel and unend
ing as the most exacting traveler could
wish. So far from being a tedious trip
It proved Just the reverse, and It Is
now the recognized route for the great
majority of winter travel westward.
This year the train will leave San
Francisco nt 5 p. m. and Los Angeles
about 7 the following morning. Tts run
through the pretty orange groves of
Southern California and for the greater
part of the distance to El Paso will be
by daylight; likewise from Houston to
New Orleans through that delightfully
romantic region of bayous, llehened
forests and dreamy plantation scene?.
In fact, throughout, eastbound and
westbound, its schedule this season lÂ»
more favorable than ever before.
The connections at El Paso for St.
Louis and at New Orleans for Atlanta.
Washington. New York. Boston. Cin
cinnati and Chicago will be almost per
fect, and make the Southern trip to
those points quicker nnd more com
fortable than by nnv other route.

Railroads Requested to Make Re
duced Rates for Eastern Home-
Seekers Next Spring.
FRESNO. Nov. 25.â ThÂ» first regular l
meeting of the San Joaquln Commercial
Association, held in this city to-day,
proved eminently successful and the or
ganization was placed on a sure footing.
The chief interest, of course, centered In
the election of a permanent chairman, i
as the residence of that official meant the
headquarters of the organization. The
choice resulted In favor of Stockton V
A Buell of that city being chosen unani
mously. The by-laws provide that the
meetings, which shall be held quarterly,
shall be held at different points in the
valley, the next to convene In the Gas
City. While, the association embraces
twelve counties, there was present to-day
a representation from only eight, as fol
lows: ' ,Â» ! i
Fresno. Merced. Madera. San Joaquln

RUSSIAN TREATY
MAY BE REVISED
Forecast of Pending Ne
gotiations.
LITTLE PROGRESS MADE
DIFFICULTIES OF RECIPROCITY
FOR A BASIS.
Indications Arc That There Will Be
Formidable Objections to the
French Treaty in the
Senate.
Special P'.sratrh to The Call.
WASHINGTON. NOT. 20.-Re!attve to
the statement attributed to Count Moura
vlefT, the Russian Minister of Foreign Af
fairs, that the propriety of remodeling the
trade treaty of ISH Ixtween the United
States and Russia was now under consid
eration. It is learned that about two
months ago this movement wu Initiated
by the Russian Kmbaasy here. The suc
cess of the French Government In nego
tiating a reciprocity treaty was probably
the incentive to the Russian move. From
the number and scope of reciprocity
agreements and special treaties which
have been drawn up under the terms of
the Dingley tariff act, besides those which
are nearlng the point of conclusion under
the broad constitutional power of the
President, It began to appear that a Euro
pean nation unfortunate enough to be
omited from the llat of privileged nations
would be at a gr> it disadvantage 1" con
tinuing its trade with the United States.
This fact first dawned upon the German
Government, and it has been endeavoring,
thus far without success, to obtain a re
ciprocity treaty, the obstacle being the
uncompromising attitude of the German
agrarian interests against the United
States meat and provision trade, though
this promises to be modified by the
Reichstag in the future. Russia was the
next power to see the advantages of re
modeling ncr trade arrangements with the
United States and the lirst overtures vi
that direction were notes about two
months ago. The matter has not moved
very speedily, and it Is not yet possible to
forecast the exact form the new arrange
ment will take.
It may be. as indicated by Count
Mouravitff, a revision of the trade treaty
(1833 or the two Government! may de
cide to frame a pure reciprocity treaty
under the general terms of the Dingley
act, such as was made with France,
though owing to the expiration of the
term allowed by the act for the completion
of such agreements and treaties, this one
may be drawn up under the reserved
powers of the executive and so be free of
special limitations as to scope. It Is sur
mised that the deliberate progress being
made In the present Instance is due in
part to the difficulty of finding articles of
trade between the United States and Rus
sia which may advantageously be made
the subject of diminutions in duties. This
is owing to the fact that both parties are
to a great extent agricultural countries
and the necessity of protecting such
products as well as the producers of raw
material. I:. view of this the basis of ex
changes will be difficult to reach.
The Indications of rather formidable op
position to the approval by the Senate
<â¢{ the French reciprocity treaty has given
some concern to the officials of the State
Department who nave had much to do
with its negotiations. This treaty was
perfected with the greatest difficulty, and
was In Itself regarded as the means of
restoring the good will and cordiality be
tween the United States and France,
which had undergone a even strain
during the last two years.
ItÂ« failure, it It said, would bo most un
fortunate and the officials ar*> prepared to
show to the Senate by statistics that
I the United States has secured all of the
advantages from a purely economic point
of view that could be expected, having
regard to fair treatment of France.
The State Department has. In fact, pre
' pared Itself on a large scale for the de
fense of the treaties and arrangements
; which must go before Congress during tho
â  approaching session. The only question
still open is whether it shall lump all of
there arrangements and treaties in a gen
eral argument .â¢Â«!..! statement or shall
make each the subject of separate repre
sentations. Because of the number of the
, treaties and arrangements which have
been negotiated since the adjournment of
the last Congress, a number far In excess
of the most sanguine advocates of reci
procity arrangements in the State De
partment, it would appear that the latter
I course would Impose great labor upon
tho department and It may be from con
sideration of this fact that the conven
i tions will be turned Into the Senate en
( masse and left to rely for support upon
the strong representations which the
President will make upon this subject
In his annual message.
FUNDS TO HOUSE THE
O'CONNOR ART TREASURES
Ladies of San Jose Are Conducting a
Very Successful Emporium on
South First Street.
SAN JOSE. Nov. 25.â The ladles of the-
O'Connor art building committee are con
ducting an emporium at 78 South First
street to secure funds for erecting a build
ing to house the magnificent art collection
recently presented to the city by Mrs. M
P. O'Connor. The collection is valued at
over $20.iÂ»h1. A building site has been se
cured in Normal Square. The gift was do
nated on condition it building be erected.
The ladles already have several thou
sand dollars in the fund for the purpose,
and it is hoped Andrew Carnegie, who Is
now building so many library and art
buildings, will com* to their aid. It Is
hoped to erect a building to cost not less
than 115.000. and one that will be an orna
ment to the city.
Yesterday and to-day the emporium was
thronged. It will remain open till Thanks
giving eve. â¢ All kinds of art work, flowers,
delicacies: and groceries are sold. It is con
ducted like a large department store.
The department containing home-madÂ©
delicacies and cooked chickens, salads,
etc., is In charge of Mrs. A. T. Herrmann,
while Mrs. W. I* Wonilrnw and Mrs.
Mitchell Phillips preside over the depart
ment of all kinds of fancy articles. Mrs.
E. O. Smith conducts the grocery depart
ment and Mrs. E. J. Crawford the re
freshment quarters. A floral display Is
under the supervision of Mrs. E. Coppock,
Mrs. H. D. Matthews and Mrs. Kennedy,
and Mrs. Ed Fisher and Mrs. Harry
Pierce conduct an art department. Miss
Davis is cashier. Numerous young soci
ety ladles assist In all the departments.
MEXICO REFUSES TO
EXTRADITE GONZALES
As in Other Places, the Flea Is Made
That the Evidence Is Circumstan
tial and Insufficient.
HOUSTON. Nov. 25.â A special from
Eagle Pass says: Embas>sador Clayton
telegraphs from the City of Mexico to
this. Maverick County, that the .Mexican
Government refuses extradition of Leon
ardo Gonzales, a Mexican citizen, accused
of the assault and murder of an Ameri
can woman at Sanchez, on the Texas
pide, some months ago, on the ground of
lnsumcient evidence.
The case has engrossed considerable at
tention as being one of the first to arise
: under the now extradition treaty and has
caused several collisions between the
governments of the Stato of Texas and
the Slate of Coahulle in the ilrst instance,
: and later between Secretary of State Hay
at Washington and the Mexican foreign
office through Ambassador Clayton. The
accused has meanwhile been held in cus
tody by the Mexican authorities.
The case Is similar In many respects to
that of Mrs. Rich, an American citizen,
who was surrendered by Texis and the
United States to Mexico on the charge
of the murder of her husband, though the
i evidence was wholly circumstantial.

YACHTING PARTY

DALLAS. Tex.. Nov. 25.â Nothing has
been heard from E. 11. R. Green's yacht

STANFORD'S
PERSONNEL
IN DOUBT
Varsity and Second Eleven
Men Vying for Places on
the Team.
BY J. F. SHEEFJAN JR.
Special DlÂ«pÂ«tch to The Call.
DEL MONTE. Nov. 25.â The eardlnal
>r>e< â¢ football men of Stanford had a
day of solid hard work that savored of
decided Improvement over early sea
â on form, but which still evidenced
some lack of unity of action. Can
the eleven gain it by Thursday next?
Is the question. If not the generally fierce
aggressiveness, the manifest determina
tion and the fact of being in superb con
dition may still make the toam a sturdy
opponent of the blue and gold. This is
the hope of the coaches and the spirit of
the players. Backed by as sincere a con
fidence of the Stanford student body la
the fighting ability of the eleven as I
have ever seen, they are at their cut-out
work with a zest that la good to see.
Over on the improvised gridiron on the
polo field at 10 o'clock this morning the
twenty-six candidates were run through
I signals for an hour. Candidates they may
be still called, for it was nip and tuck
yesterday and to-day for a number of the
coveted places, and the general nmash of
Varsity and second elevens for touch
downs demonstrated an equality of rough
rushing force, with perhaps an advantage
i In favor of the !lrst team in end running
gains.
Coach Cliamberlaln has officially an
nounced that no llnal selection or the
eleven will be made until the day of the
game. This afternoon Lee, the freshman
ct-titer. got back on the Varsity and looks
like a fixture. De Forest flanked him on
; the left, while Cairns' slight Injury gayÂ«
Huston the right guard place during the
practice.
"Babe" Burnett and McFadden offici
ated on the right wing at tackle and end.
rith Traeger and Beckley on the other
side In the same positions respectively
Rice was re? ted for the day. while Parker,
for two years Varsity end, was on the
â¢"scrub." Haiti, the freshman captain
played quarter and was used in the far
back Held on the receiving and run in
Smith, the '03 half, Fisher and Boren com
pleted the make-up behind the line. With
Parker. Krb and Oilman out again in
shoulder harness over a bad bruise, Hay
den. Roberts, Allen and Rudolph playln?
the game with a commendable despera
tion and plenty of Individual cleverness
on the scrub team, the Varsity personnel
Is certainly .--Tin in doubt. Captain Mur
phy ha* not yet donned his football togs
and. II at all. only Thanksgiving d,, will
see him back of his team on the field.
To-morrow will be a day of complete
rest, but the condition of the squad will j
probably allow some fast, hard play on
Monday and Tuesday. Murphy, assisted
by "Billy" McLeod, has certainly suc
cessfully timed the finish In point of phy
sical fitness for the battle, and. differing
from the final days of other lessons, the
few remaining days may be safely used
if the coach so determines in further per
fecting team playing. Good condition
means good spirit among the men, and.
while the odds are certainly against them,

NEARLY TWO HUNDRED DIS-

Of These Eighty Were Sick When the
Vessel Sailed From ManilaâRe
mains of Five Soldiers
From Nagasaki.
TherÂ« were eight deaths, on the United
States transport Sherman during the voy
age from Manila. The vessel made the
run across In twenty-five days. Including
a stop at Nagasaki. From the latter
place the nin was made In the good time
of Fixteen days.
The Sherman brought over the follow
; ing cabin passengers: Major Henry Wl

John Finley, Captain James Xlckerson,
Seventeenth Infantry; Captain McMullan.

will come on to San Francisco on the

The Sherman brought over 194 dis
charged soldiers. Of this number eighty
were on the Pick list when the vessel
sailed and seventy-two of them arc still
very sick men. The other eight died dur
ing the passage. Their names are:
Walter H. Guthrle. Twelfth Infantry;
Peter Dougherty. Thirteenth Infantry;
James C. Harrington. Twenty-second In
fantry; Joseph Qulnn. Twenty-flrFt In
fantry; William L. Donovan. Ninth In
fantry; John Burns. Sixteenth Infantry;
William Ralnslow. Hospital Corps, and
George F. Mil lanahan. Fourteenth In
fantry.
The case of McClanahan was very sad.
I His one desire was to live until San Fran
cisco was reached. In one sense his de
sire was jrratltl'Mi as he only passed away
after the ship's anchor had been dropped
I off Folsom-street wharf. The bodies of
â¢ the dead we.re all brought to Ran Fran
cisco. With them are the remains of the
following five soldiers who died at Naga
saki: F. W. Tucker. Twenty-third In
fantry; Alexander Lundstrom. Third Ar
tillery: Leslie R- Waterman. North Da
kota; R. H. Ralph. Utah Battery, and
Thomas Olson. Wyoming. These men had
been left behind by the various trans
! ports on their way home In the hope that
I the climate of Japan would do them rood.
I They were too far gone to rally, how
ever, and died In the hospital.
The Sherman took out to Manila the
: Thirtieth Infantry, and would have made
a very fast round-trip had she not been
detained four days at Honolulu. She was
not able to dock yesterday owing to the
lack of wharf room, but will be berthed
, to-day. â

The Good Work.
Among the various lines of work carried on
In this city for the help of others, none prob
ably will commend Itself more urgently to thÂ«
general public than that of the "Silent Work
ers.' In the "Sunshine District." as they have
named It. with headquarters fit No. 936 Hani
son street, between Fifth and Sixth. This
work was started and Ib largely managed by
the few members of the Society of Friends
(called Quakers) living In this city, but thÂ«
outside public la also Interested In It and many
leading men and women are contributing to
Its support. While It Is not termed a religious
work and Is not bo devised. It Is Intended to
lay the foundations for upright lives among
the children of that very populous neighbor
hood.
Within the past two months extensive im
provements have been made to the building*
occupied, embracing the property from No. 928
to No. S3S on the street named. The Day Home,
No. 930. has been opened for little folks whose
mothers or caretakers are compelled to work
through the day for the support of themselves
and tho*e under their care. It Is neatly fitted
up. with many novel conveniences and com
forts for those who patronize It. Every child
who enters It has motherly care and kindness
equal to that Its parents could give under any
circumstances.
"Sunshine Kindergarten" ts an older work
and has been In operation for about two rears.
It Is among the largest and best regulated of
these worthy Institutions on the coast, num
bering 150 pupils, with nearly 100 In dally at
tendance. The reading room Is well stocked
with library books, magazines and periodicals
for the ure of those who are not so situated
that they can take the Free library books to
their homes. "Sunshine Library." established
about one year ago. furnishes reading for the
mothers and children In this neighborhood
without cost. The literary classes, called the
"Psjbsjjt" and "Sunbeam" clubs, meet on Tues
day afternoons, and receive proper Instruction
according to the age and advancement of the
pupils.
ThÂ« sewing classes are among the moot In
teresting of the various lines carried on. Over
100 pupils, from six to sixteen years, regularly
meet with iodi' twelve to fifteen teachers on
Thursday*. Many of these children have had
no Instruction In the art of needlework or em
broidery except â Â» this school teaches them.
The singing class. started about eighteen
months ago. has given Instruction to a hun
dred or more girls, taking them from thÂ»
streets and Uly-provMed homes and riving
them a detailed knowledge of this accomplish
ment. It would d â¢ Â»r visitor on Friday af
ternoons good to hear tnelr sweÂ»t voices.
The. Mother*' Meetings on Wednesday are
among the Interesting features of the work.
They are well attended by those In the dis
trict, and supported and assisted by philan
thropic women. Every day and every hour Is
occupied with some kind of uplifting educa
tional work. Six young women give their en
tire time from early morning until late In the
evening, and about forty volunteers come once
or twice a week.
A Thanksgiving dinner will be supplied to
the children on Wednesday, November Ml nt
12 o'clock. A meeting will be called at 10:30
a. m.. when Thanksgiving exercises will he
rendered. The public Is Invited to these exer
cises and to witness the dinner In Sunshine
Hall. No. 828 Harrison street. a plain repast
will be furnished to all who attend as Inter
ested visitors.
Donations to the Day Home,, the Library or
of new and second-hand clothing to distribute
among those who are In .need of It are thank
fully received. Over 700 garments, mostly new.
were given out during the winter months of
last year. This work Is not called a "charity"
work In the common sense of the term. It Is
designed and applied to encourage those who
are less fortunate to help themselves and to
teach and show them how to do it; how to be
self-supporting, economical, harmonious and
generous to each other. The results so Tar
have been entirely satisfactory to the worker*.
Visitors, especially those Interested In child
work, are always welcnm". *

U. S. S. RANGER
GOING TO THE
PHILIPPINES
Now Being Fitted
With 6-lnch Guns.
ORDERED TO SAIL FOR PANAMA
â¢
GETTING READY FOR A LONG
VOYAGE AT MARE ISLAND.""
â¢ â 
Officers Have Received Sealed Orders
From Washington, Which Will
Be Opened When the Vessel
Reaches Panama.
â¦
A mystery appears to surround the prep
arations which axe going on aboard the
United States ship Ranger, now lying at
Mare Island, and well founded rumors are
current that the vessel la bent on some
secret mission, the nature of which the
officers refuse to divulge. The Ranger
has been completely fitted up evidently [
for a long voyage, and the fact that she
is being put In warlike trimâ being fitted
with several six-Inch gunsâ is evidence
enough that she is about to depart for
some remote place to guard United States
Interests.
All that the officers will say to oft-re
peated questions Is that the vessel has
been ordered to Panama and will sail
from here early in December, but ail other
requests for information as ro where she
will go from there are met with a polite
refusal. The answer Is given that they
have received sealed orders from th-?
Navy Department at Washington, which
are to be opened upon their arrival at
Panama.
From hints let fall here and there, how
ever, by people who have Inside informa
tion It Is quite certain that the Ranger
will proceed to Manila, where she will be
anchored on shore duty. The necessity
of a war vessel near the new possessions
in the Philippines makes the necessity of
such a course obvious. The fact that the
preparations for her departure are such
as are made for long voyages all point to
the strong supposition that the Ranger
will make a trip that will not end at
Panama and that the Philippines are her
ultimate destination.
PAINTER FINNING'S DEATH.

His Skull.
Coroner Hill held an inquest yesterda>
upon the body of James Finning, a paint
er, residence W Dolores street, whose
dead body was found last Thursday morn-
Ing in a vacant lot on Waller street, be

The evidence wn.s that the deceased had
been seen on the evening previous very
much exhilarated "n Walter street near
the lot. He had fallen on the sldnwulk
and left a clot of blood there from a
wound on his head.
The autopsy surpeon testified that he
hail made an autopsy and had found that
a fractured skull was the cause of the
man's death. The Jury returned a verdict
of accidental death.

SEASONABLE HINTS.
Guard Your Health In Fall and Early
Winter.
A chnnge from warm to cold Is always
attended with more danrer than from a
j cold to a warm temperature, hence the
| greater mortality from lung and throat
diseases nt this p^son of the year aa
compared with spring.
The best protection against colds Is not
so much in extra, clothing aa In goud
digestion.
If the digestion and circulation are good
colds will -be unknown.
Poor digestion causes poor circulation
of the blood and when In this condition
I severe colds are contracted on the slight-
est provocation.
People who make a regular practice of
taking Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets after '
meals are free from colds, simply because
thÂ«ir digestion Is perfect, the heart strong
and regular, and the whole system fortl-
Bed against disease.
It requires little argument to convince
any one that the best safeguards against
colds, pneumonia and changes of tem-
perature Is a good stomach.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets taken after
meals are dissolved, and mingling with
the food cause It to be promptly digested
and assimilated; they do this because
they contain nothing but harmless diges-
tive elements, which digest meat, eggs
and other food even when the stomach It-
self is weak and flaccid.
Stuarts Dyspepsia Tablets make people
well and keep them well, and the best
: habit you can acquire Is to make dally
use of them at mealn to keep the digestive
1 organs strong and vigorous.

New South Winp Added to the Home
of San Francisco's Earliest
Charity.
The managers of the San Francisco i
Ladles" Protection and Relief Society held I
their first reception In the. recently en
larged home on Franklin and Geary j
streets yesterday afternoon. The corridor
and reception rooms were thronged with \
society's charitable ladies and their
friends. The focus of the festivities was,
however, the south wing. This has been
lately added, and with its addition the
home is a block in length. It was beau
tifully decorated with potted plants and
cool boughs of evergreen trees. On the
stage at one end of the hall the children
of the home marched and drilled and as a
grand finale were formed in lino and san<
kindergarten songs. Light refreshments
and the inevitable tea were served during
the afternoon.
The society was organized In ISKS to pro
tect and provide for mothers seeking work
and also taking care of their children. j
After a time the society devoted Its ef- 'â 
forts to maintaining a children's home |
exclusively, but a raw old women have ,
always been supported. When the society
first organized a small house on Tehama
street sufficed for their needs, but the
good work of the charity has grown until
In IMI the present building was begun, .
and enlarged as the need of room In
creased, until now the original plan has,

CONSOLIDATION OF PRECINCTS
AUDITOR WELLS' BEQUEST TO
POSTPONE OVERRULED.
1 Provisions Made for Appointment of
Officers at a Reduced Compensa
tion and Expenses Will
Be Kept Down.
â¦
The Election Commissioners yesterday
| morning passed resolutions for holding
j two bond elections next month. Auditor
i "Wells asked that the matter be postponed
; until next July, or later, on the ground
j that the city's finances were In such a
, condition that no money would bo avail
able for the expenses of the proposed
elections. He thought It expedient to have
the money appropriated out of next year's
tax levy, but was overruled by his col
leagues.
The resolutions as adopted provide for
the consolidation of the established 303
general election precincts Into 100 special
election precincts. One of the elections
will be held on December 27 for the pur
pose of submitting the question of tho Is
suance of bonds for the acquisition of
lands for public park purposes, and the
other, on December 29, for Incurring an
Indebtedness for the acquisition of a sewer
system, construction of a new City and
County Hospital and the construction of
seventeen new schoolhouses and repairs
to achoolhouses now existing.
Auditor Wells refused to vote on the
1 consolidation of precincts, but voted with
the other Commissioners on all other
propositions connected with the elections.
He stated thai only $65,0i0 was appro
priated at the beginning of the year for
election purposes, and that amount has al-
I ready been overdrawn by $30,000. Ma.
inelan and the other Commissioners,
however, took the stand that the elections
could not bo delayed, and proceeded to
, make the necessary arrangements, but at
i an expense, according to Registrar Step
pacher's figures, not to exceed $20,000.
On motion of Commissioner Tllton it was
| decided to limit the number of election
cmcers in each precinct to four, the com-
I pensation of each officer to be $15 for the
â  two elections.
Bills for the election Just closed were
ordered paid to the amount of $26 296 14.
9. De^ per cent was deducted from the bill
of Cunningham, Curtlss & Welch, owing
â  to the fact that the large envelopes fur
nished by that firm were not satisfactory.
7he same tlrm was awarded the contract
to furnish 75.000 envelopes.
At the suggestion of the Mayor, the six
clerks who have been watching the vault
In which the ballots are kept will be dis
missed next Monday. In the future the
Mayor. Registrar and as â  many of the
Commissioners who desire will place their
' oliicial seals on the vault and a policeman
will be placed on watch.
The Commissioners adjourned to meet
agnia to-morrow morning, when the of
ficial results of the election will bo de-
I clared.
â¦ T%3 .Y 111 nave aa Section." Bald Audi
â  tor Wolls after the Election Commission
i era had adjourned, "but tho money will
have to como out of the pockets of the
city's creditors. This will not be very wel
come news to the merchants who have
furnished supplies and who are now clam
> oring for their money, but the cold, bare
fact confronts us that there will a defi
ciency of over $200 000 in the various mu
nicipal funds at the end of the present
i fiscal year. I anticipated a deficiency In
: the general fund If $6:<0.000 because of tha
j refusal of banks and corporations to pay
on bonds held by them and on the as-
I sessmeuts a* levied by Assessor Dodge.
' I understand, however, that they aro
paying In the moneys under protest and
intend to sue the city for the amounts
claimed by thorn to bÂ« Illegal. It is cer
tain that tho city will bo Involved in end
less litigation, with a possibility of an
unfavorable decision. In that event my
i estimate of a deficiency In the general
fund â¢.-11! not fall short of the figures I
have stated."
Tho estimated deficiency at the end of
the current fiscal year >-1900 as compiled
by Auditor Wells Is as follows:

The Assessor Called Down on "Billy"
Blattner's Appointmentâ Present
Employes Will Be Held Over
for Sixty Days.
Â»
Those representatives of the push who
since election have been actively engaged
In Job-chasing have given up guessing
and axe waiting expectantly for official
announcements. With the exception of
two or three olQces the names of thus*
who are to claim the positions exempt
from civil service requirements will prob
ably be announced between now and thÂ«
firs: of the month. Sheriff Lackmann Is
about ready to name bis assistants; Tax
Collector Scott has already made a semi
official announcement of niÂ»; Treasurer
brooks has named Jack Rei>s as his sole
appointee, and Ldmoi.d Godcbaux Is still
01 a mind to establish his brother as
chief deputy In the Recorder's office.
Speculation now is chiefly directed at As
sessor Dodge. The versatile Assessor has
already written and broken two or three
slates and is at present engaged, with thÂ«
assistance of thÂ« Mayor, in writing an
other. In the first place he had Intended
to establish Billy itlattner as cashier in
his office. Blattner Is a relative of thÂ«
Assessor, and notwithstanding he Is a
stanch Republican was a leader In
Dodge's llgnt for re-election. Dodge ad
mits that Tact as readily as any one, and
stood ready to make good by rewarding
his champion with a substantial salary.
Phelan and thÂ« rest of tha Democratic
coterie, however, made a kick on party
lines. While they recognized and were
ready to reward Blattner'a service they
thought It might be done without antag
onizing good Democrats, bo they promised
thÂ« Assessor to place his candidate in
Borne other quarter. Since then they have
bten hard at work on Sheriff Lackmann
in an endeavor to have Blattner placed in
his office, but the Sheriff has held out and
will likely appoint Sig Simon or some
other man as competent, if he can bo
found. The push is finding Sheriff Lack
mann not as amenable to â¢pull as it had
calculated.
So far there has been no one found to go
up against Ed Williams or any of his
clerks for the positions in the Justice's
Clerk's office Mr. Williams has held the
principal duties of that office down for
years, and In all the time of his excellent
administration nothing of suspicion nor
anything more substantial has attached to
him. It is considered a foregone conclu
sion that he will be asked to remain. Con
cerning his assistants there Is a question
of whether or not they are required to
meet the civil service examinations this
year, or llko the Justices of the Peace
continue undisturbed in office until the
next general election.
The intentions of Auditor Wells have
also been a matter of considerable bad
ruesslnx. Mr. Wells' campaign was
handled by his present chief deputy, Dan
Leary. and his son, William Wt-lls. and
Judging from results was admirably con
ducted. Lt-ary was scheduled originally
to succeed himself, but there are those
now who claim to know that Mr. Wells
intends his son for the. main office. If
\\ ells succeeds L*ary. however, it will bÂ«
done with the tatter's consent, as he is
considered one of the most conscientious
and valuable men In the City Hall In
case he does not continue In the Auditor's
office he will be well placed In somo other
department.
nearly all of those now in the City Hall
will be held over as temporary employes
until after the civil service examinations
aro complete and the results announced.
County Clerk Deane intends making no
change, and it Is likely that in order to
facilitate business Tax Collector Scott
will allow things to remain as they are
It is understood that Assessor Dodge will
do the same thing and also City and
County Attorney Lane; In fact. Mr. Lane
Intends keeping his present force intact
throughout the year. Official announce-
m m X are expected from nearly every
office by the Ist of Decrmber.

The transport Ohio, which sailed for
Manila last Friday, had more passengers
aboard than the Government contemplat
ed sending out. The vessel went out into
the stream on Thursday nght. but the
extra passengers were not discovered un
til the- Ohio was well over the bar 'on
Friday morning. It was pretty rough
and the chief officer was making every
thing -nut;. Passing one of the lifeboats
he saw that the canvas cover was loos
ened at one end. so he proceeded to lace
it up. While doing so he caught sight of
a very woebegone face, and an Investiga
tion showed .vix boys, whose ages ranged
from 6 to I- years, curled up in the li.it -
tom of the boat and all deathly seasick.
They were all got out on deck and .it
once began to cry and beg to be sent
home. As noon as the pilot boat l.aily
Mine hove In sight and Pilot Mcl'ulloch
was ready to go aboard her the t-ix young
sters* were put into his boat and he agreed
to land them at Meiggs wharf. Yesterday
Pilot Fred Jordan brought the pilot boat
In, and after giving the lads .i good scare
let them go. They said their names were
Kddie Wilson. Robert Murphy. Eddie
Hrown. Joe Smith. Dick Barnes and Eddie
lllggins. They told Captain Jordan that
six more boys were stowed away aboard
the Ohio and that they were not going to
appear on deck until the vessel was two
days out. as they had plenty of "grub"
and water. When discovered the boys
will be put ashore at Honolulu, and from
there sent back to San Francisco.
There wan trouble on the transport St.
Paul Just before she sailed for Manila.
The chief steward and the engineer's de
partment were at outs, and the trouble
only came in a climax a few hours before
sailing time. Then the engineers de
manded the dismissal of the chief stew
ard, and the men in the hitter's depart
ment said th.;. would o.uit In a bony if
"the old man" was let out. The engineers
retaliated by threatening to quit In a body
If the chief steward w. re kept In the ship.
As it was easier to get stewards than en

and dismissed the chief steward. There
upon all ; .')â â  men In the steward's depart
ment, to the number of thirty-two, walked
out. and their places had to be filled at
the, last moment.

BRAVING DEATH'S TERRORS
IN THE SMALLPOX CAMP
IT was not any surprise to the many
friends of Surgeon A. H. Olanniiil,
U. 8. A., when the report was made
public that the young doctor had
charge of the smallpox honpttal
and that he would personally look af tor
the soldiers of the I'orty-eighth Regi
ment that were Htrlcken down with the
dreaded and dangerous disease. Every
body that knew the phyelciun or bad
ever met him reudlly recognized the
fact that he had gone to his command
ing oilici.T. and with a seen sense of
sslf-sacrl6os had expressed the wish
thai he might have the detail to care
for the sufferers Mild to act In the ca
pacity of physician till all 'danger was
passed. Thin 1.1 not the first time that
It Glanninl hnn acted In a brave man
ner, a ltttlM over two years ago, when
Miller, an Inmate of th*Â« City and Coun
ty Hospital, wan attacked with typhus
fever. Dr. Glunnlnl, at that time an In
terne of the hospital, volunteered to
nurae the unfortunate man. Hit* faith
ful work In thin eaÂ«e almost cost the
vounc physician hi* life, aa the long
vigil In a draughty tent and overwork
laid Olannlnl low, and he wan a lon* time recovering his former good health.
When the League of the Cross camped at Santa Rosa last year Dr. Glanninl
actM as Knrgonn at the encampment, and he endeared himself in everybody's
heart by the kind, gentle and conscientious way that he attended the cadets
who responded to "sick call."
The young doctor has seen service at both the harbor and park hospitals,
but shortlyafter the war broke out resigned his position in the Board of
Health department to accept a commission In the army.
The many friends of Dr. Gtannlcl will wish for the best and hope that no
harm will come from the young man's brave act. and feel assured "that this ]Â«
another example that chivalry and knightly acts can still be found In this up
to-date nineteenth century.

SOME ONE HAD BLUNDERED.
John Williams. White. Serves Nine
Days in Jail for John Williams,
Colored.
There wns consternation In the City
Prison and in Judge Trea4weU's court
yesterday when it was discovered that
John Williams, charged with vagrancy,
was missing. Officer Wallace was satis
fied that he was taken from the court to
thÂ®- prlsnna-wwk-as<Â», Serj^eant I-lnd
helmer was satisfied that he had been re
leased on his own recognisance., and a
note of the fact had not been made on
the prison register, but this did not sat
isfy the court, who demanded that John
Williams be brought before him.
Clerk McQuaide searched the. records of
the court and discovered that John Wil
liams, a colored man, had been sentenced
to pay a tine of $20. with the alternative
of twenty days, for discharging firearms
within the city limits on November IS. A
commitment was sent to the prison. Wil
liams was released in a few hours, a
friend having railed and paid his fine to
Sergeant Undheimer, but the commit
ment was not destroyed.
John Williams, a white man charged
with vagrancy, had been arrested the day
before and his case was continued for a
week. When the County Jail van came
In the afternoon for prisoners, the col
ored Williams had been released and the
white Williams was sent in the van on
the commitment for twenty days of the
colored Williams.
Williams, the vagrant, will be brought
from the County Jail to-morrow to stand
his trial after serving nine, days through
a blunder of the prison officials.

Young Wife Alleges That While She
Danced at the Tivoli Her Better
Half Spent Her Meager
Salary.
Â» _â 
The course nf true low never did run
smooth, but in Herman Westerfeld
Jr.'s case it seems to have selected its
roughest o urse. Yesterday afternoon
Mrs. Orov*da Westerfeld swore to a com
plaint In J::iij:e Mogan's court â  r^inp
her husband with threatening to take
her life. Hark of all this lies a romantic
story of love's young dream and a rude
awakening that should serve as a TÂ»-rrt
l>le example to all afflicted with a desire
for marital felicity.
Young VWnterfeld will be remembered
as having rhout a year apo. In spite of
ihe wishes of his sweetheart's mother.
~arried off Oioveda Raymond to Stockton,
where they wore promptly married. And
then his troubles boean.
The young couple returned to this city
and went to housekeeping but the task
proved too much for Westerfeld. and then
for two woeks his mamma -in -lay kept
the pair at the Hotel BalbOEL When the
paying of hoard bills became monotonous
Mrs. Raymond notified the latest addition
to her family to "pet" â and he pot. But
against her mother's wishes Orov-.-la
"got** with him. and when shortly after
ward abc â¢went to visit an aunt at Sacra
mento he accompanied her.
About h week aftor their arrival at Sac
ramento Mrs. Raymond was roused from
her after-dinner nap by the telephone.
and. to uff her own words, was "almost
knocked out" when she heard her dauÃh
ti r was extremely ill. the attack beinj;
caused. It was alleged, by her husband
nssertinK his authority by thumplnj; h*r
with a broom. Naturally, when Mrs.
IVesterfeld recovered she soupht the shel
ter of the maternal roof, and from her
mamma's arms she refused to move when
petitioned to do so by her now repentant
spouse. But after a while she rejoined
him. and as finances were at a low ebb
she accepted a position in the Tivoli
chorus, making her first appearance ap
propriately enough in an extravapanza
railed "Bluebeard. "" For this she received
six dollars "per." which, according to her
MTMon, Â»er lord with rare thought fili
ng* drew himself In order to take care
of It. And tukt- car^ of It hn did. The

came last Thursday night. Colen grabbed
It as a turkey cobbler would grab a June

apparel was a I'erfect blase of glory. A
flame was he whom no woman could re
sist. and of such warmth that there is i
tradition among the laddies th.it on one
occasion an line, seeing him pan the
house, "rolled on a light, never waiting
for the horse".

A DISEASE-BREEDING POOL.
Death Threatened at the Potrero by
â Land-Locked Filth.
The citizens living on the south side of
the Potrero ha-. <â  presented an urgent ap
peal to the Board of Supervisors "for relief
from a deadly cesspool that Is threatening?
the life and health of the entire commu
nity. Some time after Kentucky street
was Riled from the Potrero to South San
Francisco another fill was made to a
tend Army street to a connection with the
former thoroughfare. Hoth fills were !nto
the bay over the mud Bats, and the exten
sion of Army sir.-l made â  huge pool of
over fifteen acres, which Is now full of
slimy fetid, disease-breeding water, there
belns'no outlet to the bay. All of the re
fuse liquids from the vinegar and yeast
works, the bone and fertilizing works and
th*Â» sewers from Army and adjoining
streets are emptied Into this big pool, and
the stench tha: arises therefrom is caus
ing no end of sickness In that section of
the city, which would be â  growing neigh
borhood. .. . . 'â â 'â 
Within the past Fix months â  number if
deaths have taken place there In conse
quence of the, diÃÃUstlnK pool, and diph
theria and other forms of fever are now in
a degree prevalent In the Potrero. A peti
tion signed by all the people living within
many blocks of the place was yesterday
presented to the Supervisors. asking that
a big cut bo made through the fill in Ken
tucky street so as to allow the tide to
flow In and CSITy out. the filth of the
place. It will require a culvert of at least
fourteen feet to secure the desired results.

to disturb the quiet of his evening rev
eries.
But the days passed by and Colen's
chance seamed as far off" as ever, until
Officer? Leonard and Caples took it into
their heads to help it along a bit. They
procured a coeoanut. which was fashioned
to resemble a human head. On this they
painted a face, after fixing to the top a
wig of long raven tresses. Then tney
stuffed a dummy body with straw.- and
making a pair of legs out of broomsticks
and arms from some laths, they lireâ
the whole thing up In woman's clothes
and deposited it on the floor of room 1 in
the lodging-house at 520 Hush street.
The lights were turned low. the furni
ture was disarranged so as to give, tne
place the appearance of having been the
scene of a frantic struggle, and a boy was
dispatched to Colon to acquaint him with
the fact that a murder had been commit
ted on his beat. The two officers stationed
themselves at a corner which Oolen would
have to pass to reach the place of the
tragedy.
In a, few moments they saw their victim
hurrying up. accompanied by Officer Nel
son. whom he had summoned to his as.
slst.mce.
"Hello, <"olen. Where are you going in

"I toie youse fellers mt- ehand would

LITTLE WAIFS

Charges Against Mrs.
Reed.
THE EUREKA SOCIETY ROW
â¢
WILL DISINCORPORATE TO END
THE UGLY SCANDAL.
â¦
Children at the Home Tell of Cruelty.
Abuse and Neglect â A Shock
ing Condition of
Affairs.
The Eureka Society for the Protection
of Children will soon be a thing of the
past. At a meeting of the directors last
evening St was decided to disincorporate
I and go out of existence. A policeman was
present to nee that the members did not
fight. A committee was appointed to at
i tend to the dissolution and place the chil
dren of the Eureka Boys 1 Home in char
itable Institutions. The conditions making
this necessary originated at the very in
ception of the society, Borne four years
ago. The organization was created out of
the California Society for the Prevention
of Cruelty to Children and from that time
I on It has been in a turmoil, petty factions
striving to hold control. It has been open
ly charged timo and again that the desire
for power was prompted by such illicit
perquisites as the unscrupulous could
"graft" out of the cases coming to Its
door*. Suffering, neglected childhood was
a second consideration to the dollars and
cents that could be filched out of the so
cial position of the body.
The Immediate cause of the breaking up
of the body was the repeated charges that
the home on Sanchez street was being
conducted in a shocking manner and that
the forty-odd waifs were â¢ being Inhu
| manly treated. In order that last
evening's actions of the society
may be understood It ,Is necessary to
state that at a recent meeting nearly all
of the old board resigned and an entire
new board of directors was elected. Then
came the charges against the manage
. ment of the home and the new board re
fused to accept tne positions to which
they were elected, Charles Montgomery
the former president, seeing that some
, thing had to be done, called together the
old directors and announced that he
thought It time to wind up the affairs of
the 'society, but before doing so It would
be well to have some grounds for such an
action, â  something â¢ more than â¢ the many
charges and recriminations of blackmail
j bribery and dishonesty that have disgust
Fisher, the proprietor of the house, was

One by one they were brought Into the

according to their simple tales, has been
guilty of revolting cruelty, neglect and
even brutality. All testified to have taken

that shocked every listener. Little Willie

the society had paid for and which had
been converted Into luxuries by Mr
and her f:iniiiv. The latter, according to
the Story, had liv<d at tho horn- and onÂ»
of the latter. Pearl Reed, a violent tem
pered girl, had frequently assisted the
moth.-r in her abuse of the lit 1 1Â«- charges
of the society. According to the state
ment of Mrs. Petto- th.- matron had pre
vious to being Riven the charge of thÂ»>
home, been arrested for cruelty t<> chil
dren. Mrs Pettee stated that the reason
that Mrs. Reed had not been prosecuted
was that sh<> (Mrs. Reed) paid Frank Hol
brook. the former secretary. $20 to silence
the matter. Another charge was that
Pearl Reed had been receiving company
at unusu.il times of th" nleht and had
compelled the children to go nut for beer
and Whisky for herself and company.
Mrs. Reed was given â  chance to tHi
her side of the story and she denied that
she had been either inhuman or neglect
ful of her little charges. She also denied

was taken into th.- home. K. [Â Wadham.
also an ex-secretary, stated that he had
learned enough of the conduct at the
home to make him take from Its roof the
children over which he had been appoint
ed Runrdlan while he was a member of the
society.
At this point K. Mnrchand. a director of
thp-e weeks, begged to resign, aa he had
had enough of the "dlsgiisting affair."
Oiairman Montgomery urged him to wan
and help wind up the affairs of the unfor
tunate Society, and In order to head off
any further argument on the matter he
appointed J. F. OBrlen and Acting B
tary Heanston as a committee to attend
to the disincorporatlon of the society.
Mr. Montgomery stated that while" there
had been rumors of abuse and neglect at
the home, the matron had always been
upheld and supported by Dr. Dalzal and a
few other members of the old hoard, who
would not hear of having her Investigated
or dismissed. On one point the chairman
was emphatic and that was that food sur
flcient for three months had been provided
for the little ones at the home. He ap
pointed Mr. O'Brien and Mr. Beanston as
a committee with full power to act to see
that the children at the home are distrib

to Chief Dunn that he saw Ho Mun with
the others and that Mun said that he was
well. Dr. Gardiner paid also that Chief
Dunn declined to grant the request of Mr.
Costello for a permit for a physician to
the County Jail because Ho Mun on that
very day had denied to Mr. Da Sllva thai
he. was sick, and the chief did not wish to
allow an opportunity to any one of coach-
Ing Ho Mun as to what his testimony
should be.
The matter of the death of Ho Mun In

expressed. A committee was appointed to

FINISHED
HEADS ON
THE WIRE
Hair-Lifting Drives the Rule at
Oakland â Zoroaster
Beats Morinel.
The Saturday crowd of racegoers to
Oakland track were treated to some un
usually close and exciting finishes, in
every instance the winner having hla
number displayed only after a lons, gruel
ling drive. The weather was cloudy and
gloomy and the track, a most regrettable
feature, slow. Otherwise some very fast
time would have been hung out. Seldom
has a more magnificent equine battle been
witnessed at the course over the bay than
that which took place between Zoroaster,
Morlnel and Satsuma la the mile and a
furlong purse event. The betting favored
Satsuma with his 107 pounds, which ruled
favorite, with 8 to 5 against Morinel and
fours about Willie Shields 1 scrappy llttlo
horse. With orders to ko out in front
Bullman on Morinel at onc<> v/ent to work,
cutting out a heart-breaking clip. Jones
trailed closely with Dr. Rowell's horso
and Jack Martin astride Zoroaster kept
his weather eye open not many leagues
away. Turning into the stretch Morinel
was leading a length and as Satsuma
found a soft spot and faltered he was
passed by Zoroaster. Then ensued a fierce
duel to the wire, little Martin riding like
a veteran, landing his mount winner over
Mat Btorn's honest mare by a nose, in the
fast time of 1:56& Satsuma, after his
mistake, grew groggy under hard riding,
finishing ten lengths away.
Four other first choices also met with
hard usage, and the books no doubt had
much the better of the argument. From
various causes Rachel C, Yellow Tail and
Recreation were all turned down. Anjou.
at 20 to 1. was the longest priced winner
of the afternoon.
Beyond doubt the defeat of the 110,000
beauty, Yeliow Tail, occasioned the most
surprise. Fred Foster's giant was a 4 to 6
chance for the two-year-old Jaunt over
the Futurity course and a raft of coin
found Its way Into the books on him.
Leading until within a few yards of thÂ«
wiru he bepan tiring under Thorpe and
was downed a head by Anjmi. from the
stable of Walter Jennintrs, excellently rid
dt-n by Spencer. Burdock in a drive took
the show from Bamboulla.
Osculation, the handsome Salvator-Tum
Yum mare, showed a flash of her old form
In the opening five-furlong scramble for
four-year-old mares. Going to the post a
6 to 5 tavorite, Kpencer kept her in front
all the way. winning, all out. a length be
fore Torslda. Be Happy nnlshed third,
ahead of El Salado.
A bumping match lees than a furlong
from the wire accomplished the defeat of
Kachel C, favorite for the seven-furlong
two-year-old run. It Is more than prob
able the filly would have scored, when
Mandumue, which was leading, swerved,
colliding with the first choice, which Sn
turn jostled Dunblane. While all this
was happening Morgan, on Expedient, an
8 to 1 Mint, forged u> the front, beating
Rachel out a head. Dunblane was third.
The finish of the seven furlongs for
three-year-olds wu marked by another
exciting finish, Casdale. Rio Chico and
FaverEham being lapped on each other as
the wire was passed. Casdale. the win
ner, was ridden by Bullman. and in the
ring ruled equal choice with Faversham.
Backers of Dr. Rowell's Sybarls, winner
of the final six-furlong sprint, were In
deed lucky. In the run from the head of
the stretch the gelding occupied the entire
track, finally managing to get the decision
over Recreation by a nose. The latter
mare had a decided call In the betting.

to be a thorough in and outer the Judges
decided after his race yesterday that in
future the colt'B entry would be rejected
at Oakland.
The big string of race horses owned by
Tommy Griffln arrived at Oakland track
from the East yesterday. Some horses
owned by Albert Simon also came in the
same car. Now that Griffin le here own
ers will be pretty apt to enter their horses
ih selling races somewhere near their
proper valuation.
The victory of Casdale brought nothing
but sorrow to "Bill" Murry. When put
up to be sold Tony Cook, the bookmaker,
"boosted" the colt $500 over his entered
Belling price.
Kick Hall was a spectator at the track.
N'<k says his horses proved very bad
travelers, all being on the sick list up at
Sacramento, where they are stabled. Soon
after reaching the capital city Canace, the
best breadwinner of tlif> string, died from
an attack of lung fever.
Walter Jennings thought Dunblane had
a royal chance and bet on him. He waa
beaten, and Aninu. which scored at long
odds, he allowed to run loose.
Yellow Tall is not partial to a heavy
track, and the Lip fellow will probably do
better as the mud dries up.
PLAY A TIE GAME.
Belmont and Centerville Elevens Are
Evenly Matched.
BERKELEY, Nov. 25.â As the game be
tween Belmont and Centerville for the
football championship of the A. A. L. re
sulted In a tie this afternoon the question
of supremacy among the schools^ of the
league remains as yet Unsettled. It la
possible that another match may be ar
ranged between the two contestants, but
nothing as to that has yet been decided.
Belmont and Centerville lined up on the
University of California gridiron shortly
after 3 o'cuock this afternoon. Each had
previously defeated all the other teams of
the league against which they had been
matched, and this was to be the
final game of the season. In weight Bel
mont averaged about 152 pounds, being
about seven pounds less per man than
Centerville. The difference added very
little to the Alameda County men's favor,
for neither they nor their opponents
showed any epeclal advantage one over
the other.
In the first half -Belmont had the kick
off. Centerville took the ball, and, buck
lug for repeated gains, carried It down to
Helmont's five-yard line. Here it was lost
on a fumblo and the danger for Belmont
passed. In the second half Belmont
worked down to Centerville's seven-yard
line, but lost the ball on downs. Center
ville worked back almost to the twenty
live-yard line of their opponents but
failed to pet further. The game closed
with the ball not far from the center of
the field.
Following Is the line-up of the elevens:

TRIED TO
PLAY BALL
IN THE FOG
Locals Take a Game From
the "Dudes" With the Aid
of Umpire Graves.
Umpire Graves did not endear himself
to 800 baseball enthusiasts yesterday at
Recreation Park by calling "game" at the
close of the seventh inning. It Is true
that a heavy fog bung over the diamond
and made it bard for the players to see
the ball, but if he had allowed the contest
to proceed to the end and given the Oak
landers a chance to overcome the sllg --
lead that the local nine had obtained his
action would have been generally ap
proved. To the minds of many the dark
ness was even greater in the ilfth Inning
than at the time the game waa called.
Had Graves ordered the men off the field
then ho would have acted wisely. It will
take Mr. Graves a long time to win back
the favor of the "fans."
Uncle Henry's victory, If it can be called
such, was due to Muller's home-run drive
over the center lietd fence. The husky
and youthful left-ttelder of the Friscos
made his four-CUSbloned swat in the iifth
when both uani.s were tied with one run
and he raised the tie by scoring Pyne and
himself. Mullc-r was given an ovation,
which made him blush becomingly.
Oakland was tirst to tally. In the sec
ond Donovan took first on a single and
went to second on Bolger's wide throw to
first to catch him napping. .L&nge then
advanced him to the third cushion and
he came home a few minutes later on
Reilly's muff of the ball thrown to catch
Lange at second.
The locals evened things In the fourth
Inning when Sullivan scrambled home on
a nice single by Courtney. In the follow
ing inning Pyne was hit by Steffani and
romp<*l leisurely home in company with
Muller when that youngster drove the
spheroid ovw the fenc.
An amateur twlrler named Bolger was
put in the box by "Uncle" Henry as an
experiment and he surprised every one by
holding down the Oaklunders to three
hits. Mr. Bolder was artllcted somewhat
with stage fright, but did better than the
majority of novices who are pitted against
a band of professionals. While he may
not set the bay on fire by his pitching,
still he Is worth trying, and it is well
known that "Uncle Hank" must try. as ho
Is about to lose both his twlrlers, thanks
to Mr. Graves. Bolger has few curves,
but relies principally on his speed for ef
fect. The Athenians found him often,
but were unable to land safely. Follow
ing is the score:

ulty, are looking forward eagerly to the
one great day of the college calendar, the
day on which the blue and gold lines up
against the cardinal for the great annual
tussle with the pigskin. â¢
While the utmost enthusiasm and con
fidence seems to prevail there has not
been the slightest relaxing of the strict
discipline which the men have to undergo
in preparation for the battle. Regular,
systematic practice is kept up. The only
noticeable change since la6t week is the
almost extravagant degree to which the
enthusiasm of the whole student body
has grown. This afternoon It broke nut
stronger than ever; on the eve of battle
it will be Intense,
Monster rallies are the order of the day,
and they are curried out on a scale far
exceeding anything In the traditions of
the college.
This afternoon as the team lined up for
a short, snappy practice- the bleachers
were packed, and yell after yell went up
to encourage the men on the gridiron. As
soon as play was over the whole mob
â urged up to the gymnasium to listen to
impromptu speeches. Cochran, Kelly,
men of the team, not omitting some of the
instructors, mounted the rostrum In turn
to provoke unbounded applause for the
prospects of the blue and gold. The came
was done last night, and will probably be
repeated until Wednesday.
Cochran has decided to give his men two
mot*. Jays of work. Monday afternoon the
'varsity line-up, the same that is to face
Stanford In the big game, will have a
short practice with the second eleven.
Their last day will come Tuesday.
Wednesday Is to be devoted to light signal
work, and then the last touches will have
been put on.
Cheeking at the game will be led this
year, as last, by the college Rooters' Club.
Some f.OO of the students, decked In blue
and gold caps, are to have a section spe
cially reserved for them. A yell leader
will direct all the cheering, as well as the
number of rooters' songs which have been
composed for the occasion.
A temporary abandonment of the train
ing quarters on the campus was made
necessary to-day owing to the sickness of
one of the helpers In the kitchen. The
man came down with typhoid pneumonia
this morning, and as a precautionary
measure the quarters have been thorough
ly fumigated and will not be ready for
use again until Monday morning. In the
meantime arrangements have been made
for the men to take their meals In Oak
land.
ELLIS IS BARRED.
Bo Decides the Faculty Committees of
Both Universities.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY. Nov. 25.â
Ellis, the Berkeley quarterback, will- not
play In the bis Thanksgiving game. Pro
fessors Richardson. KelloÃs and Marx
representing Stanford, decided this at an
Inter-faculty meeting held at Palo Alto
to-day, when they refused to withdraw
their protest to Ellis* amateur standing
This means that the California team wlli
be handicapped by the lose of the plavirir
of the quarterback to which It has become
accustomed.

surprises, several warm favorites being

GENERAL FI'NSTON, who has been
the central llgure In Oakland so-
U the cent i . ! n < lakls
ciety for some time, sailed away for
the seat of war on Thursday, and
Mrs. Fumton Is left behind. Her health
would not permit of her going back to the
Philippines, and she will reside during her
husbands absence at her home on Tenth
avenue. The general and his charming
wife have been Lionised since his return
with the Kansas boys, and their â inning
manners have made them deservedly pop
ular. Just before leaving the general re
membered that th*Â« only opportunity he
and his wife had ever had of ecttng
a camera was In the Philippines, and his
lnFt act before sailing was to pose for a
farewell picture.
Society has been busy during the past
two weeks with the library site. This
matter was taken up by the Ebell. which
Is practically the leader of local eoci^ty.
la such a practical way that the ryes of
the whole county have been opened, and
the Ebell now appears in a more valuable
light than it has ever done before, de
spite its many previous successes In the
line of philanthropic and useful work.
Every day there has been a social gath
ering ut the Ebell. and the results ha /c
been very gratifying, and the ladles are
deserving of the greatest credit for tnk-
Intc up a. project so eminently useful and
tarrying it out in such a thorough man

not dt-slred by the ladles to be associated

it is pleasant to note the good reeling
that always exists In AJameda County be
tween churches of all creeds. At recent
fairs and bazaars as far down as Mission
San Jose the priests, ministers and onn
irreftntions have always united to make
the current fnir or bazaar the one event
to be patronized irrespective of the ob
jects of the benefit. This custom has not
been fo noticeable In Oakland as in the
interior of the county.
The Ladles' Guild of Nlles has changed
the date of its bazaar from December 5
to December 8. The feature of the even
inc will be a monologue by eight young

SECRETARY BARNETT
MAKES EXPLANATION
OAKLAND, Nov. 2.".â Frank Harriett,
secretary of the medal fund for the Ala
meda County volunteers. who were mus
tered into service during the war with
Spain, says that the charge made against
the commttt'-c that the medals were left
ai Â«. saloon for the volunteers to call for
them is unfair to him and the other two
officers of the committee, Dr. Pardee and
John A. Hritton.
"The situation is simply this." said Mr.
Barnett to-day; "after the presentation of
medala nt the Tabernacle, it was found
that there wen many volunteers who
were not <>n hand. The duty was i< ft to
me as secretary to see that these medals
were distributed to th< proper parties. For
several weeks 1 put in a lot of work find-
Ing the ni-n and s.-.-inn that they pot thi-ir
certificates and medals. A few we.-ks ago
l bad a few medals left and decided to
writ*- to each of their owners and tell
them where they could call. Joe Rosen
berg's <iÂ«ar store is the most central
place in t"\vn. and I left th<-m thei
si nt postals t.> every volunteer without a
medal that he could call at the store and
receive it. it is true that in the r.-ar of
Rosenberg's place tin re is a saloon, but
his cigar business is Independent <<f his
liquor trade. We put in many months of
hard work collecting the money and ar
ranging for the distribution of the medals
without any other reward than that "f
self-satisfaction. I do not think anybody
is deserving of censure because tin- f--w
remaining nu-dals were placed at a cipar
store for th<- owners to call for them. My
duties take me to the Supreme Court
building in San Francisco every day. and
consequently I had to make some such ar
rangement. However, so lonir as objec
tion has been made, I wish to notify those
volunteers who art- still without medals
ai d certificates that they can obtain them
by applying to John Brltton at the office
of the Oakland <",a^ Company."

The building trade* of Alameda County
were surprised to-night to learn that the
final details of a big lumber trust
had been completed and that next week
the prices will be largely advanced. All
lumbÂ«T business after December will ba
conducted under â  castlron schedule, for
the breaking of which any concern in
the trust above enumerated must pay a
forfeit.
For fifteen years there has been no r >m
blne among the lumber men of Alamtda
County and during that time the price of
lumber has nearly always been a llttlo
lower than in San Francisco, where a
combine hoa dated for some years. !n
this county each firm has mjule Its own
prices and there has been ronslderiMo
cutting. About a year ago the Stone
lirothcrs 01 tried up extensive lumber
yards and forced competition to *ucn a
degree that there was practically i lum
ber rate war. although the demand was
always greater than the supply, -â¢> that
prices never got very low. The m m firm
rapidly bu'lt up an enormous business
and frequently wen unable to supoly
their customers.

MME. D'ARVILLE
HAS ABANDONED
OPERATIC WORK
Decided to Take Up
Vaudeville.
COMIC OPERA WITHOUT FUNDS
SALASSA THE BEST BARYTONE
IN THIS COUNTRY.
The only two comic opera stars In
America, Who have an International repu
tation are Camilla D'Arvllle and Lillian
Ruesell. Th.> .former arrived In this city
a few days apo and will make her ap
pearance at the Orphcum this afternoon.
This accomplished vocalist is well known
to San Francisco theater-goers. She ap
peared here twice with tho Bostonians
and made one of the bigpest successes of
â¢ any prima donna. Her last appearance
here occurred about four fears ago. Find
ing that the managers of comic opera
were mostly unable to nay their employes,
Mme. D'Arvlllo decided to po on tho vau
deville stage, with an account of (28,000
owinp her. When I calle<l on this famous
singer at the I'alacÂ« Hotel yesterday I
found hor practicing. She has still that
rich voice that enthuses music lovers and
I the graceful manner with which she over
comes scientific vocal feats is as formerly
the characteristic of her execution.
"I consider tho vaudeville business from
a concert standpoint." said Mine. 1 >'.\r
ville. "I do not notice tho other numbers,
but simply attend to my own work. I
lind the vaudeville audiences very intel
ligent. They know exactly what they
want and are very discriminative In the
distribution of their applause. The rea
son why [ left th< comic opera stage la
I because there is no more money In it and
the average comic opera manager has no
Ilnancial backing. As soon as I find a
1 manager who has money and who is will
i ing to pay a living salary 1 shall go back
â¢ t>> the comic opera stage."
Camilla D'Arvllle has received flattering
offers from Europe, and it is probable that
[ she will appear in "Madeleine"* In Berlin
and Vienna next season. She has also an

from

yesterday regarding tho prolong-in? of the

more extra performances for those who

The successor to "My Friend From In

CROWDS AT THE
STEEPLECHASE
Constantly Increasing crowds Is the rulo
at the Steeplechase. The Coney Island
attractions have cauÃht the popular ye
and throng* have visited Central Park
throughout the week. Sunday is always
a favorite day. and preparations have
been made to k-.vo thousands a Jolly time
lay. The Jeffrles-Fltzslmmons light la
one of the best reproductions of a pugilis
tic encounter ever exhibited. Every round
of thlÃ great battle is reproduced with
faithful exactness. The daring feats of
Professor Hill on the hiÃh wire, the weird
experience on the razzle-dazzle and the
funny sensations riven by all the Coney
Island novelties present a remarkably
strong bill at this unique resort.

The recent decision of the Supreme Court
In the habeas corpus case of James
Knapp, tho Stanislaus County market
hunter, who was convicted of trying to
ship wild ducks out of the county In vio
lation of the ordinance, and In re
on of the ordinance, and who was re
leased by order of the higher court, was a
severe blow to many in this city interested
In the preservation of game. The ordin
ance was aimed at the market hunter,
who slaughters game by the thousands
and scare* all â¢â¢â¢ does not kill. The argu
ment made before the Supreme. Justices
by the attorney for the petitioner was
that the law prohibiting tlie shipping ut
game out of the county was unconstitu
tional. Inasmuch as the law gives the
right to the hunter to kill. The spoils of
the chase are his to sell, eat or ship, as 'â 
he would any personal property of which I
he was possessed.
The fact that the Justices of the Su
preme Court directed that the prisoner be
released is regarded as evidence that they
took the same view of the matter. Their
written opinion has not been handed down
yet. and until It Is there are but few wno
wish to be quoted in any expression as to
the decision. Whatever may be the basis
of the order, similar ordinances passed in
many counties will be made Invalid in
.ny counties will be made Invalid by
the higher tribunal. The counties whose
Hoards of Supervisors have passed or
dinances prohibiting the shipping of game
are Alame.ia, Humboldt, Kern, Los An
geles. Marin. Monterey, Riverside, San
Benlto, Ban Bernardino. San Diego, Fan
Joaquln, Stanislaus, Sonoma and Tulare.
There Is gloom In the ofllce of the Stato
Game and Fish Commission, the ofllcera
of which are striving on all occasions to
draw the protection of the law closer
around the wild game of the State. Cr.m
mlssloner Gould stated that he had no ad
verse criticism to make of the order of the
court, which he considers legal and Just.
The regret Is that the case should have
ever been taken up there for a decision,
which surely will give the market hunter
full swing to slaughter at will. Commis
sioner Vogelsang takes the pame view of
tho case. He Is waiting with interest for
the written opinion to learn same view of
cap--. He Is waiting with Interest f>r
written opinion to learn just how fir
reaching the decision will go toward over
throwing the anti-game shipping ordin
ances of the other counties, and If It Is
the constitutionality of the order or some
other ground upon which the discharge of
Knapp was directed.

The consensus of opinion yesterday

Associated inks' Statement.
NEW YORK. Nov. â The Financier fays:
The release of Government funds on bond pur
chases has enabled the Associated Banks of
New York City to largely Increase their cash
holdings, the surplus reserve of J6.652.200 con
trasting sharply with the deficit of $311,000 re
ported a year ago. Singularly enough, how
ever, the banks taken Individually do not seem
to have strengthened their standing much, one
large institution reporting a train In cash fir
t<r<Rter than the aggregate of all the banks.
The deroult Item show* the same result, M that
thÂ«Â» only benefit the other banks have derived
U the lessen^ liability reserve which does not
offset thrlr losses In cash. The individual re
serves, therefore, ii.- in some cases lower than
laFt week. Hut for all this the monty market
has Â«-ased up j^reeptlhly. It Is <]Ulte probable
that the statement does not ivftÂ«M;t actual condi
tions. ThÂ» contraction In loans. It may be
noted In this particular. Is to be traced to the
came Institution that absorbed the cash. Its
loss of five millions more than equaling the
loss of all the banks. The majority of the
banks, therefore. " would seem to have ' lost
slightly In cash and In deposits and expanded
their loans. So far as the outlook Is concerned
there *eems to i,Â« a disposition toward easier
rat(-s. although the decline may not be more
than nominal. The steady contraction which
has been golnc on at 'this center for some
months cannot continue Indefinitely. Deposits
are now lower than at this time lam year, and
loans have shrunk much below the November.
IS3B. average The only difference in the two
exhibits is that at this time last year the bank*
had thirteen millions more surplus reserve. As
they have the opportunity for securing Govern
ment funds now. and as the Interior movement

Recently Attorney General Ford was
asked by communication froir. the office
of thÂ© adjutant general as to tho stand-
Ing of an officer of the National Â«Juard
who had accepted a commission In the
United States volunteer st-xvlce. The
reason for thÂ© question was that an of
ficer ho had accepted such a commission
had asked 10 be placed on the retired list
of the National Guard. The Attorney
General gave the matter Into the hands
of William M. Abbott, his deputy, who
reported the following conclusions:
"Under section 1973 of the Political
Code, M amended In 1897, a retired olllcer.
although not active, is still a member
of the National Guard and is subject to
* the orders of the commander In chief, as
provided ii subdivisions 4 and 6 of â  :i-'l
section. This being true, tho opinion ren
dered by you to Adjutant General Peeler
on February* 3, IK<9, would apply and the
said officer who accepts a commission in
the United States volunteer service Ipbo
facto ceases to be a member of the Na
; tional Guard of California In any ca
pacity. Having ceased his connection.
i with the National Guard by the accept
ance of a commission in the Unit.-*: States
Volunteer ! ervlce such officer, after his
i bald acceptance and prior to his re-entry
i into the guard in the manner prescrihod
by law, could not be placed upon the
retired list of the National Guard."
Th.- guardsmen all over the State are
wondering if the time will ever come
when there will be a revision of that com
bination of misinformation known by its
title. "Rules and Regulations of me" Na
tional Guard of California." commonly
called "The Red Book." Those rules and
regulations are about as useful, to the
guard as would be one of Ben Franklin's
almanacs, for the reason that they are
not up to date, are not In conformity with
the many chances thai have been made
In the laws since It was published many
years ago and are so confusing thai if
officers tried to follow them and reconcile
them to what a number have learned dur
iing duty in the volunteer service, they
would in a short time find themselves
candidates for admission to th*- asylums
for the Insane. The] say that the book
should be cast aside, and that the adju.
tant general's office should provide a new
one.
The annual ball of the Signal Corps of
the Second Brigade was given last Wed
nesday night In Golden Gate Hall, which
for thÂ»- occasion had been elaborately and
with excellent taiÂ«te decorated to meet the
demands for a military ball. The Invita
tions were of the swellest and the dance
i programmes with embossed signal tlags
and torch In gold and copper plate print
, had upon them thirteen numbers and
three extras, the regular dances being
only waltz and dues temps. There was
,an assemblage of many of San Fran
cisco's society people, and aside from the
members of the corps, who were in uni
form, it was a full dress function In the
strictest sense.
Among prominent members of the guard
who were present were Major General
, John 11. Dickinson. Brigadier General
Warfleld. Colonel Thomas M duff. Lieu
tenant Colonel Joseph G. â ting. Major
Charles J. Evans. Major 11. B. Hosmer

"The night wan black and' the only things

started to come down and I knew then
that a mutiny was on. so I grabbed my

'You ought tv be killed for this night's

" 'I wish I had killed you when I had

denly her beautiful russet gold hair be

on a level with Everard's own. With a
startled exclamation she hastily arose,
lotting fall the royals from her hand,
while a crimson wave swiftly mantled her

Inwardly chiding himself for having

cod of empire, and giving him an oppor

â¢.hough sligiitly humid as with recent
t^ars. were blue as the royals at her feet.
At length she replied to Mi query, ad
.lrossiisg him according to the insignia of
his uniform:
"No. lieutenant, my mother alone Her

for Manila on that May day over a year

among those fatally wounded at the battle
of Santa Ana and I have come to decorate
his grave jusl as if he were indeed buried
âto consecrate to his beloved memory
the flowers with which 1 would have gaily
decked him had be returned with them.
Listen! hear th<* din of the jubilant mul

where triumphantly flaunting. How it all
sefnis to mock my grief! But i know
there are ninny sorrowing like myself for
thfir lost brave and I am striving to rec
oncile myself to the law of Providence,
which at first seemed so unkind, as. aside
from my father, Archie was all 1 had."
There was a brief silence, then spoke
the lieutenant:
"I. myself, am of the First California
Infantry Regiment. Your brother's name
was Archie. You sayâ Archie "
â¢"Archibald Hammond."
Lieutenant Osmond repeated the name
meditatively.
"1 am certain. Miss Hammond." he add
ed, "of having heard the name before. If
Indeed. 1 have not met your brother per
sonally. T'pon returning to my apart
ments 1 will refer to my war memoran
da, which may contain some reference
to him. If so. where will a muni

He made a note of thÂ« ad
dress and tonk deferential
leave of the beautiful
mourner. But all that
night the lovely pale face
of V!Â«let Hammond,
with its "royal." tear
humid eyes and its
halo of glorious
golden hair,
haunted his
bed - chamber,
banishing
deep there-
from, holding him in a thralldom.
On the following morning she received a
large bunch of California violets, accom
panied by the lieutenant's card.
They were brought by a messenger; and
Violet hovered over her favorite name
sake blossoms Inhaling their perfume
with a strange, sweet ecstasy.
"Would she ever meet the handsome sol
dier again?" she wondered, and concluded
not, as she was In mourning and would
not, therefore, attend any of the social
functions where he would be always hon
ored as his superior manhood and insignia
of war merited. No, in the vista of gloom
which encompassed her she could not,
though belonging to San Francisco's "ex
clusive set," expect the felicity which such
social contact would engender; but there
is a "Providence which shapes our ends. '
and the ensuing morning Violet was hand
ed by the housemaid another card, the fac
simile of that which had accompanied
Lieutenant Osmond's gift of violets.
"The day Is superb, and I have come to
ask you to drive with me to the Presidio,"
he said, a* she joined him duly in the par
lor.
Her face crimsoned, but also it wore an
'expression of strange beatitude as. won
dering somewhat at his informal request,
she gracefully asi?cnu-d to it. and soon she
was seated beside him in a box-cart
drawn by â  pair of line spirited chestnuts
end rolling along the boulevard toward
the military rendezvous. The late August
day was ideal, with Its pacific sky and
the flower-sweet air just palpably stirred
by the ocean breeze. There were many
equipages on the popular thoroughfare*,
most rf which, gnyly decked in bunting,
and streaming flags, were carrying festive
soldiers and their friends to and from
the scene of the encampment.
But Violet's spirit partook not of
the occasion's revelry. She was In
comparably sad, and though her
companion strove to entertain
her with narrative of his re
cent campaign In the foreign
island?, her dlstraitness
was patent to him and he
knew sh? was thinking
of that floral mound
under the cypressâ
that grave upon
which rested the
Pillow with Its
pathetic motto
in violets.

he had forgotten to make the promised reference to Ids *v
memorandum in respect to Archibald.
"I take It," Osmond remarked, aa they PÂ«Â«Â«d through
the arched gateway and proceeded up the flower-flanked
dri\*e toward the Presidio, "that you would not object te
visiting the hospital. Miss Hammond."
Violet looked at him wonderlngly. **I *Â»* not con
sidered as to that. Lieutenant Osmond."
"I intend calling upon a sick comrade there.
and as it is â  case of particular interest I fan
cied you would like to come."
"Certainly. I will come with you," she as.
nuiesced. and despite her heart's dominant
sorrow the thought crossed her mind at
that instant that she would gladly should
he ask her, accompany him to the re
motest part or the globe. Yet. albeit "
she was of a romantic nature, no
thought of love occurred to her.
To Ormond himself the moment
was a supreme one.
At her words he exclaimed
elatedly. "Good!"
Violet wondered what re
lation the term could
possibly have to a vlplt
at the bedside of a
sick soldier, which
to her promised no
thing but sadness,
"Is the com

you refer of

â¢he asked.
"He is of my

this brief/ and eva

lieutenant assisted
her from the carriage.
They entered the hos
pital and were conducted
to a aeml-darkcned room,
from which at their en
trance and a silent signal
from Osmond a nurse softly
withdrew.
"Who Is here?" a voice spoke
â oftly from the bed.
"It Is I, Lieutenant Osmond, who
called upon you this morning. I
have brought a lady with me, and am
going to leave her to sit with you for a
HtUi while."'-- /.-;â 
"Butâ aâ my father and sister. Lieutenant
Oemond! Did you visit them and are they
coming to see me?" "''.''
The words, though eagerly spoken, were very
faint and If Lieutenant Osmond heard he made
bo reply to them, but turning to Violet he mur-

Uke one dazed Violet sat. her eyes riveted upon the door
through which he disappeared What could his- summary

The sick soldier lay quiet, as If waiting for some one to speak.
rhe clock told the noon hour and the last ringing chimes roused
violet. Advancing toward the bed. she strove to see more distinctly
the sick man's countenance, but there was a broad bandage about
.tin eyes and she could only perceive that his face was very pale and
emaciated. Bending gently over him she timidly ventured:

The sick man
moved restively.
"Ye*." he said: "yes.

my regiment, but It was
a strange voyage: they
had to carry me to the
Â»teamer as they had to carry
me here.
"Oh, then you were 111 at the
starting? " asked Violet less con
strainedly.
"Yes and for six months previous.
I was wounded at the battle of Santa
Ana last bruaryâ at first they thought
fatally-and 11 had been better so. as I
am crippled and blind; at the islands
they said incurably blind, but maybe they
were mistaken, and now I am home my
father will have me treated by â  special

likely Lieutenant Osmond ha* not had
time to inform him as to my being at the
hospital. They think of me as dead, no
doubt, as it was reported so In the papers
and afterward I hadn't the heart to
write to them just how It was. It will be
all but Jolly for father and VI to find me
like this."
"For whomâ whom did you say. ' eager
ly questioned Violet, bending lower over
the Invalid.
"For the governor and Vlâ Violet, who
Is my sister."
Still lower bent the young girl, her
breath now coming fast.

I had a brother -t the Philippines and my
name also is Violet!"
"Yes. It Is odd, very ot.d." accorded the
your* soldier, "and of count* your

"Alas, no. Among the unmarked graves

my darling Archibald."
"Archibald?" bewilderedly repeated the
young soldier.
"Yes, Archibald Hammond."
There was a quick, low cry. The sick
man stared Into a sitting posture, his
arms outstretched toward her. and even
in the semi-darkness Violet saw the radi

*-* VR. SHELBY MARTIN, the
[\ /I banker. Is certainly a man of
I y I resources, and as the patter
V. * I song In "Mikado" runs, he "has
JL devised a plan whereby young
men may best be steadied." that Is, very
young men. The young man who has
developed all this latent talent In Mr.
Martin Is his hopeful son and heir. John
WeÂ«tley Martin, aged about I years.
Mr. Martins troubles began when he
gave up his comfortable home In this city
and moved to Oakland for the winter.
His family physician said the baby must
have more fresh air and a chance to root
In the dirt, otherwise he could not an
swer for his health, and as the baby did
not seem to be abnormally rugged, Mr.
Martin, like a devoted husband and a
doting father, moved to Oakland. He
rented a swell flat on Eighth street and
settled down for a few months of peace
and quiet, where the chirp of the cricket
and the croak of the bullfrog harmonise
sweetly with the hum of the trolley car.
Mr. Martin found everything Just as
the obliging real estate man had prom
ised. The climate was all right, and the
dirt for the boy to play In was there la
abundance. Then there was the con
venience of having a trolley car pass the
door every five minutes.
The baby's health began to Improve
rapidly; not so with his parents, for
they were gradually being worn to shad
ows from constant watching. During
business hours Mrs. Martin and thÂ«
housemaid had to stand watch and
watch, as they do on board chip, In orÂ«
der to rescue that boy from under the
wheels of the trolley car. and when Mr.
Martin came home In the afternoon he
had to stand his watch. This brought
things to the point where patience
ceases to be a virtue, and the head of
the family set his wits on some scheme
to overcome this constant worry. He
consulted all the neighbors without suc
cess; then he tried the commuters. One
crusty old bachelor advised him to tie
the boy to a tree. Sheriff Martin said
he would lend the banker a pair of leg
irons, with the further suggestion that
It might be a good idea to place a ring
bolt In the Sidewalk, then fasten the
irons to the ring with a chain lust Ion?
enough to keep the boy clear of thÂ«
track. But somehow none of these sug
gestion* seemed to please Mr. Martin
very much, and Mrs. .Martin considered
them Just brutal. , â¢ Â * â ..
One day. In order to give Mrs. Mart n
a much needed rest, her husband said
he would take the boy to the clrcu;. and
while enjoying the wonders of tna
menagerlo they finally arrived In front
of the monkey cage. Of course the 111
tious purpose of "serving honorably and
getting an honorable discharge."
The Forty-sixth have already recog
nized his personality and his evident abil
ity. Within the month he has been pro
moted to the rank of sergeant, with the
special honor of being a member of the
color guard. He palled with his regiment
on the City of Bjrdney.
When questioned as to his friendship
with the son of General Grant, the eer
geant grew communicative.
"We were classmates at West Point,
and we have always been close friends.
The papers are wrong in their idea that
I helped him through tho academy and
coached him through his examination-*â
they are wrong, entirely wrong. It was
not so; we were classmates and friends,
that mi all."
Serjeant Wasson is modest she loyal
to his friend. It li a matter of tradition
nt the academy that Fred Grant was as
dull as he was good-natured, and that
Wahson as a cadet was at the head of the
school and was as intellectual and bright
as his friend was dull:, It Is a matter of
tradition. a thct Fred Grant was pa
tiently aided and pulled through bit four
years at the academy by his devoted
friend, and tradition adds also that it
was through the Influence of Sergeant
Wasson that the professors of the acade
my were enabled to compromise' the mat
ter vith their consciences and grant the
son of the President his diploma."
"Is it not true that you were thÂ« pro- -
tege and particular friend of General
Grant himself?"
"The general had the kindness to Inter
est himself In me. â¢ It was through his
Influence that I entered the Japaneso
armyâ ln fact It was upon his advice and
by his kindness that I was enabled to go
to Japan at tlrst. It was not done through
the gratltudo of the general for my sup
posed kindness to Fredâ that Is absurd."
Sergeant Wasson has a mother away
back In lowa, ho told mo. with tears In
his eyes, and there was a look of tender
ness! on his handsome face. When I told
him he had been photographed he asked
me to send one of the photos to her.
"She is the dearest old lady, with whitÂ©
hairâ"
The sergeant suddenly broke off. sighed
and gave me the addressâ "Mrs. Julia A.
Wasson. Stanhope, lowa." He comes of
a good old German family of lowa and ho
tie boy clapped his hands in delight wh?n
he beheld the playful beasts. "< >h.
papa," he cried, see what a nice little
playhouse the monkey* have, and th--y
can't get out on the railroad track, so
they never get whipped for running
away."
Lucky star! Surely there tai an In
spiration. As soon as the show was over
Mr. Martin hurried home and Informed
his wife that he had struck the correct
Koiutlon for their problem at last. "Never
mind what It Is." he exclaimed with aup
A Playground That Molds the Youngsters Secure From the Trolley Wheels.
Is proud of the fart.
Sergeant Wasson also had n wife. tt<Â»
met her In Japanâ the daughter of John
Blngham, special rnvoy to the Mikado's
court from the United States. ThÂ« ro
mance In the sergeant's life was short;
the bride lie brought from the Orient dte-1
soon after they returned to America. It
was the one romance of his life,, though
he was a man very popular In the society
circles to which hla high position gave
him open sesame. He speaks very tender
ly of her.
"She died bcfore-whlle I was still In
tho army." he said, gently fondling the
silken Bag the honor of bearing which Is
accorded him.
It is odd and pathetic to see the honest
pleasure and appreciation evinced by the
man In the humble honors of the present
In comparison with the reckless careless
ness with which ho threw away the high
otllccs of the past.
"It Is considered a special honor," he
told me, "to be appointed color sergeant.
It is a privilege any man should be proud
of to be allowed to bear the colors." And
he added with simple pride, "I was pro
moted sergeant Immediately after I en
listed."
Gently straightening the folds of the
flag he spoke again of his hopes of hon
orable and active service.
Among the thousand passengers , on the
City of Sydney there are many who are
ambitious of military distinction, but
-there are none to whom their ambition
Is more precious than that of Sergeant
Wasson.
Besides the friend of his youth, who Is
now Brigadier General Grant, Sergeant
Was* expects to meet many military
friends In the Philippines, for he was
widely known and universally liked.
Colonel Walter Schuyler. who Is In com
mand of the Forty-sixth Regiment, and
who sailed with them to the Philippines, la
an old classmate. He will experience many
bitter humiliations In his self-enforced
service. It Is a serious offense for an
ofllcer of the army to speak with one who
has been dismissed from military position
and from the army under the circum
stances which attended the sergeant's
dismissal, unless upon matters of an offi
cial nature. Just what will happen when
the- lowly sergeant meets tho brigadier
general Is a matter of Interesting conjec
ture, but it Is safe for one to predict that
pressed excitement; "Just U\\ me where
I can find a carpenter. I will show you
In the morning what I mean to Jo."
When the carpenter came he was 01
to build a simple monkey cage In the
front yard. Mr. Meyers, a neighbor said
he would look into that matter as soon
as it became known to him, for he too
had a child who was taking a try at dis
puting the right of way with the trolley
company at least ten times a day. H*
thought he would build one himself

II bu!>lnÂ«Â» and Industrial prosperity San
Frardsoo has much to be thankful for thin year. Hardly
baa there been a twelvemonth In Its history when more of
substantial progress In the lines upon which the greatness
and power of a city rest has b*en achieved. The especial
feature of the year has be :. the blossoming of that general
business activity and Incidental prosperity, which, though
often during the two prior years proclaimed as about to ap
pear, seemed nevertheless slow in developing. Now. however.
unquestioned business rurh 1* undoubtedly at hand. It Is felt
In the affairs of almost every citizen, and nowhere more pro
nounced than in the establishments of small dealers. More
tnen arc employed In the city than has been the case since
S3l, and }.pM-;Hy never before have there been M many wage
earners thriftily engaged. Prices of commodities, which are
the wages of ?o many producers, are higher than heretofore,
and wages by week and month are generally higher all along
the ]!r.Â»Â«. The tramp problem, which was at one time so men
aclr.r and offered so much material to the disciples of unrest.
has mm 1 f.-.ded away, and a tramp upon the streets or in the
parks has come to be an unfamiliar object. Indeed, sore stress
has been f. '.t in the fruit growing, hop picking ajid other areas

This anomalous condition Is not local In any one part of
California, but it pervades the State. In nearly all lines the
activities rrl irh exist have called into employment whatever

An examination of those sources or place? where records of
busSne*s are koj't phows'the increase of 1*539 over the preceding
year upon the V>aMs of nine months from January t j Septem
ber inclusive :o be between SO and 25 per cent. Possibly from
no n-uroe can Â« more <lefinite idea of the trend Â»nd magnitude
of tmdv b<* had than from the business of the Clearing-house.
The Â« Tearing-house deals only with checks, and checks are
drawn be: ween Individuals in Ji<juiÂ«Ja:ion of balances growing
cut o2 oor.tracJa. No Instruments so amply express the volume
of business as the sum totals of the checks that pass within the
period elected.
The Clearing-house is a bank whose customers are the
bank* of thÂ«Â» city exclusively. The checks drawn upon Bank
A. but deposited In Pank H. are every d *>' taken to the Clear
lÂ£C-h:>usÂ«j mid presented for payment; to this place Bank B
brtrcs money and pays them. Thus the ehe^ks which pass
betwÂ«v*n the banks move through the O^aring-house. The
V_:s: ;,.?â â¢ of the '.-leartng-houfe does not equal the business
Core by the banks, for many checks drawn upon hanlc* .ire
presr:.ted for payment at the banks upon which they are
draws, or they ore deposited in those banks; ht^t it does reg
ister the bulk of busir.e?* passing between the banks, and
\*hich amounts to perhaps one-half of the banking business
Cone.
ThÂ«Â» proceedings of the Clearing-house for thÂ« nine past
months photr a ir^st gratifying surprise when compared trttl
- In every month from January to September there was an
Increase of business. The first month in the year was the
month of Michtest Increase, but from that on the rise has been
steady ur.i:l :he month of July, when the excess over the fig
ures of the corrvspondir.g month of iÂ«?S was more than twenty
thrr*e TuJHlor.s. In the month of September the excess had
fallen back to fifteen millions, but the gross .... busi
ness dene was over eighty-five millions, the greatest amount
for any month during th<Â» present year and more than twenty
Â«lx DQllona in excess cf the lowest month of IS9S.

It is believed the year's oleaiincs will reach nearly one bil
lion dollars, tho largest ever recorded In the history of the city.
Apart fr<im the ptatements of the ClearinÃ-house. the con
dition? cf the banks themselves reflect in the highest degree
the upward movement of the tide of business luring the past
year. The deporita of all the banks of the State amount at

thcrÂ« of lart year amounting to $24,155,111 un-I as compared with
the amounts held by the banks two years ago !t is an excess
ef f;>s,oy>.o>>-and it might be remarked that ISS7 was not the
rwmjc year either. The <!ep-isit figures cited above are divided
befvwr-n the national, commercial and savings banks, those
teirg within the cJ'.y and In the interior. The condition may be
tabulated es follows:

The Increase In deposits in the savings banks Is particularly
praMfyirg: it is gratifying, too. to note that the excess of de
pctits In the San Francisco savings banks is greater than that
Â«f thÂ« city commercial banks. This condition shows that money
has agaJn found its way Into the hands of the people and that
they are storing their surplus. As the vast majority of those
who patronize savings banks are of the working classes, it can
b<* s<-en that they are sharing the prosperity which has come
Â»w> generously upon the city and the Stute. and that the con
tÂ«?n:ment and thrift manifest or. all s!-!es is a sympathetic state
recocting good balances in the savings banks!
The Issuance of checks, as re<-orde<i by the OeannK-house.
Indicates mainly the business transacted between residents of
the city. It does not to ony depree present loreicn business.
This >'in be had quite definitely, however; from the records of

disclose, that notwithstanding the drouth which risked the

dairy and wine industries. In both exports and imports the
bulk of business was much in excess of that of IS!K. In exports
th* exce.su was over two millions and In imports about four and
a half millions.
Fan Francisco, Bad to say, has only a trifle of the foreign
tr.idÂ« which its position and facilities entitle it to have.
VThether this is the product of bad laws or lack of aggressive^
nws on the part of our merchants or l*>th. or whether it be due
to other cause or causes. It Is not attempted here to say. The
fact, however, is that the whole of the foreiÃi) trade \>f San
Francisco does not amount to more than that of the combined
business of three or four of her larpcst house*. Its exports for

worthy of regard a* a shipping article Issuing from th port
was wheat. Besides this one commodity the others did not
amount to much. It Is not bo now. Foreign trade Is growing,
and more pronounced is this a fact in 1533 than ever before.
The wheat shipment In IS3S was J4.925.0J0; In 18W. owing to crop
shortage, as stated. It was 52.3C3.000: but while still the largest
shipping product it has sunk Into Insignificance as compared
with the bulk of other commodities. In MM It form* only about
8 per cent of the total exports.
The wheat crop of the present year, however, will be equal
In volume to the average years of the past, and price? are rul
ing better. It will thresh about 573.000 tons. Already there^are
about SO.OOO registered tons of shipping In port chartered for
grain, and 200,000 tons more are nt sea, bound for the Golden
Gate.
Indeed, the shipping situation Is one of the most remarkable
phenomena now manifest In this status of business activity.
The trade between San Francisco and Hawaii has so Increased! /
In the past nine months that there exists an aggravating dearth
of bottoms In which to carry the Roods demanding shipment to
â¢he Islands. A year or more ago the condition was that a ves
sel going "down to the islands" considered Itself fortunate If
It procured freight enough to afford ballast. It went after
sugar, and calculated that Ibc return cargo would pay ex
penses. But this phase of things in now greatly changed. In-
stead of lacking cargoes, the vessels are loaded to their gun
wales, and space In them is sold for six months ahead. Indeed,
a Ban Francisco shipping firm recently refused in one forenoon
enough offers of freight to load two deep-water, ships* and this
Is a matter of dally occurrence. Half na many vessels again as
are now employed In the Hawaiian trade are necessary to tarry
the goods upon the basis of the present offering!". About forty
vessels now run to the Islands from San Francisco. This fleet,
however, will shortly be Increased by at least ten ships. With
the relief afforded by these vessels It will beporsible. to get
such cargoes as cement and brick carried promptly, without
being relegated to vessels four months ar.-ay. as is now the
case.
In the congestion which exists among the Hawaiian ship
ping no account Is? taken of the shipping conditions regarding
the Philippines. As yet the effects of these acquisitions Â»re
manifest mainly in the transport service, but when thL<s sub
sides there Is no doubt that it will leave well established a great
shipping business, which will be a duplicate of the Hawaiian
trade If It does not very greatly exceed it. The transport serv
ice is a great but Indefinite quantity in the realm Â«>f San Frarj
clsco"s trade; It Is an Institution which ha a been erected within
the past year in it- city, and so great has become It* business
that It "has leased the larKc new business block on the corner
of Market and Stcuart streets to accommodate it* onVes ami
store Its goods pending their shipment upon the transport*.
With 70,000 men in the Philip) s to feed hikl clothe and nearly
all the food and garments moving from San Francisco, It can
be realized that the shipping business of the United States
commissary li no Insignificant matt During the month e.f
September, for Instance, there were ten transports loaded ami
pent away, and these carried a quantity of merchandise esti
mated in value at Jl.&OO.OOO.
This revival of trade has come upon lh*J city by ...
gradual degrees. It may be said to have bed Its /tart at the
Irtaklng out of the wnr. though two other causes prepared
conditions for the state that followed. The election Â«Â»f Me-
KJnley did much to allay nervousness among the business ami
Industrial capitalistic classes and to give them confluence in
Inaugurating new enterprises. Then followed the Klondike
boom, which was the virtual opening of tlitÂ» gold resources of
Alaska, a development which has gone ever finer rapidly on,
new and apparently unlimited stores of wealth coming to light
In many hitherto unsuspected parts of the Territory. The
Alaskan trade of San Francisco now nmrunts to. -perhaps flva
millions per year, and may II a rough way !Â»<â¢ approximated by
the values of virgin gold which come to San Francisco from
that country. During 1593 this accretion, according to the esti
mates of transportation companies, amounted to over live
millions of dollars. While it cannot be said that all of this gold
Is used In buying goods to Mod back into the Territory, yet
undoubtedly much of It Is so employed, ond the margin that Is
not so used Is doubtless supplied by other gold, buying packs
for new prospectors and provisions* for new stores opened up
In settlements upon new gold-bearing ground.
Following the opening of Alaskan trade came the rhange of
affairs in Hawaii, with its attendant increase tti trade, and then,
ensued the Incident at Manila, which has turned attention to
the trade opportunities offering in the Orient, with the result
that many cargoes have recently gone in that direction, and th<Â»
markets there are becoming purveyed to with an much assidu
ity as characterizes the canvassing of markets at home.
These changes have transpired in regular sequence. There
has been no boom nor bluster about any of It. and It may bÂ«
remarked that real estate, of all things which money buys,
,Phows the slightest effects of thÂ« progression. There has been
[a tendency to raise the prices of rents when the enlarging of
business demanded extended space, but there has been tin utter
Indisposition to speculate in land. ljÂ»nd apparently la not
bought, except as It la needed for immediate uÂ»e. In fact, a
characteristic of the situation Is that speculation is not ap
parent anywhere; no one Is buying margins. It seems to be a
sober, businesslike purchase and nale of substantial commodi
ties and the opening of new enterprises growing out of de
mands created thereby.
With the new phase of the Oriental situation th- eyes of thÂ»
East and of England became turned upon that part of the
United States nearest the Orient. California hecame an Inter
esting placeâ the field of vast prospective commercial Inter
course with the consuming myriads of the Yellow Kingdom It
became a good and safe place In the eye of th Investing capi

It Is the bay terminus of the Southern Pacific system, and the
side towns of Alameda and Berkeley arc overflow settlements
from that city.
The recent agitation for the holding of the two national
political conventions In ' San Francisco brought out the fact
that the two transcontinental telegraph lines are about taxed
to their full capacities with business, and th.- city was denied
her chances of getting the conventions beiauso these companies
flatly expressed their Inability to perform the telegraph work
which would be demanded us a result of one of those assem
biles. The situation makes a poor showing in tho light Â«>f pos
sibllltles of the long desired trans-Puctflc cable. If thin latter
is achievedâ which might be one of the enterprises reserved for
1900â the foreign telegraphing of half the world will puss over
Fan Francisco, and with lines that cannot handle the news
evolved by two or three hundred men gathered under one roof
it can hardly be expected that much success could be attained
In delivering the correspondence passing between the Occident
and the Orient. The present rise of business will force an ex
pansion of the telegraph systems connecting this city with th*
East, and this fact may be taken a* one of the most dcsirab!Â«
achievements to be effected through the development of ac
tivities in 1899.
The population of San Francisco during 1593 has Increased. It
Is estimated, about 40.000. The census of IS2O gave the city 265.
000; upon the basis of a registration of 70,000 the population is
now 350,000. It is unhappily the fact that for the first five yean
of the present decade the accretion to the city's numbers was
very slow. No more conspicuous or striking feature was evi
denced in the city than the large number of "to let" signs dis
. played upon the windows of vacant residence houses and thÂ«
corresponding "to lease" notices upon the business blocks In
the lower reaches of the city. "To let" and "to lease" signs
are yet seen by the tourist on his rounds, but he must look for
them. They are not obtruded upon bis notice, nor do they
glare upon him at every hand, as of yore.
Industrial activity has asserted Itself with no more con
spicuous emphasis than In the business done by the Postofflce
nt San Francisco. A comparative analysis of the returns of thÂ«
several departments of this Institution tor the tlscal years of
IS3S and 1559 shows really striking results, the Increase of 1599
over 1533 being about 10 per cent. The gross amount of receipts
tor the year ending June 30, 1899, was $1,002,470. as compared
with $Â£.'0,337 for the previous year. There were 52.053.025 pieces
of mall handled In ISD3. as against 73.311.550 In ISM.. This busi
ness divided Into Its several heads presents Itself as follow:

From all quarters, wherever "tabs" are kept on business,
'there come cheering reports that comparison of figures shown
strong advances of 1893 over those of IS3S. Perhaps the most
satisfactory estimates r.rc those furnished by the Impressions of
the business men themselves. Upanddown the wholesale streets
the opinion is expressed that trade Is better by from â  to 10
per cent than last fall. Around on the retail streets the mer
chants give the same replies. All talk of a good holiday trade,
"the. best In years." and generally the feeling is that the ac
tivities are not evanescent. "They came in a staple, steady
way; they will remain steady," said one merchant. The Influ
ences which brought this activity are permanent. They Â» r <Â»

Daughters or tho American Revolution
wa* founded that Miss Alden's existence
became known outside of hrr own circle
of friends. The national society of the
Daughters of the American Revolution
was organized In ISDO at WashlnÃton.
D. C, with Mrs. Benjamin lfarrlson as
firÃt president Kcneral.
In 1531 a chapter was organized in this
city at the residence of Mr*. General Da
vid D. Colton. Alma Priscllla Alden read
of it In the newspapers. She didn't think
sho would Join it; she had never taken
out papers for the Society of Colonial
Dames. Put "he Is a stanch patriot, bo
she wrote them a little note, telling thorn
who she was and how much she sympa
thized with any movement to preserve nil
things of historical intf?reat.
A real live descendant of Prlscilla and
John Alden was too valuable an addition

Others there were who with difficulty
could trace- their ancestry back to the-
Revolution. Miss Aldt-n did not have to
engage a professional genealogist. From
father to son adown the years the story
of Priscllla was told, her children's chil
dren telling It to their grandchildren.
Miss Alden could draw her line of de
pcent as easily an she could write her a b

Dr. Hiram Alden married Melltta Hunt
ley. Alma Priscllla Alden. daughter of
Dr. Hiram Alden and Melltta Huntley.
Thus Is her descent written In the book
published by the Daughters of the Amer
ican Revolution. The members of that so
ciety know that we have In our midst a
great-great-great-greot granddaughter of
Priscllla and John Alden. But how many
others have ever dreamed of such a per
son?
Whatever the literary merit of the
"CourtÃhlp of Miles Standlsh." there Is
now no doubt of Its popularity. The
etory plays on the heartstrings, whether
or not thÂ« hexameters vibrate pleasantly
on the ear.
John n Alden. "fair-haired, azure-eyed.
. with delicate. Saxon complexion, having
the dew of his youth and the beauty
thereof." and Priscllla. the fairest
maiden in Plymouth. "Priscllla. the
mayflower of Plymouth, modest and sim
ple and sweet," owe their posthumous
fame entirely to the poet's pen. '
Miles Standlsh. with musket and
matchlock, protected th* colonist from the
Indian arrow and tomahawk. Yet 'tis not
of Miles Standish's deeds of valor that
young and old read, 'tis not the records
of battles fought and won that fascinate
â¢Tls the story of the choleric cautaln's
courtship., penned by the poet, that has
saved him from the fate of the forgotten
throng. \>v-
God sifted three kingdoms to find the
wheat for this planting, then sifted the
wheat as the living need of the nation.
Of that brave band who came over In
the Mayflower there are three names that
OTershadow, even to oblivion, the Â«<hÂ«r*.
They are Miles Brandish. John AlOma aad
PrlÃcilla. '
Borne there are who from history*! dull
page know that Miles Standlsh U not
rely a creature of the poet's imagina
tion. Not many realise that John Aldea
and Priscllla were real characters. la
fine print, nÂ» a commentary to the poem,
the readfj 1 is told that John Alden wu
an ancestor of Longfellowâ but fine
print is usually skipped by the reader.
Prlscllla's surname was Mollnes, show
ing Huguenot extraction. Longfellow'
avoids mentlonlpg It, probably because
by his time Mollnes had been unpoetl
cally anglicized Into Mullins. He chose
rather to call her "Priscllla, the Puritan
maiden," or "Prlscilla, the beautiful spin
ner."
There are one or two other family tra
ditions which the-- poet suppressed, and
which Miss I den confessed. Priscllla
had a very bad temper when her If was
aroused. She never hesitated to give peo
ple "a piece of her mind." not that Pris
rllla was a nag or a scold. She was quick
to show h-r wrath, but quicker to get
over It. Generous and kind hearted, the
nurse of the tick and the friend of the
needy: yet Priscllla. truth to tell, had a
.temper unusual to the placid Puritans.
Longfellow, while he does not mention
her temper, makes her character In keep
ing with the family traditions. She Is as
frank and outspoken as a girl of to-day.
"Serve yourself would you be well
nerved." was the excellent adage Miles
Standish forgot when it came to his
courtship. How did Prlsdlla, the "gentle
Puritan maiden." answer John Alden
when he offered her another's heart and
hand?
â¢If th* rreat captain of Plymouth It so Tery
eager to wed me, . -*, j
Why â¢:â  â  â  he not eesM hlmÂ«Â«lf aed take thÂ«
trouble to woo me?
If I am not worth the wooing I surely am not
worth the winning . *
Then John Alden began explaining and smooth-
Ing the matter.
Making It worse at he went by aaylnr the
captain was burrâ

The words grating harshly
Fell on thÂ« ear of Prlsdlla, and swift mm a
flaÂ»h she made answer:
"Has he no tjme for such things, aa roil tall

Priscilla Alden of Jo-Pay
Jells About
Priscilla Alden of Long Ago
T THINK that the descendants of the Puritans feel that
Â£ Thanksgiving means just a little more to them than to the
rtst of the nation* The ghosts of my ancestors are always
with me on that day. I feel their joy is mine, I hear the Gover
nor proclaim a Thanksgiving, I see the people, with prayer and
thanks, sit dozvn to a repast thai we in these days of plenty
would call but scanty fare.
I must confess that the thought that I am a descendant of
Priscilla and John Alden gives me a eat deal of pleasure. The
other pilgrims who braved those first terrible winters were just as
courageous, but the romance of John and Priscilla makes them
more interesting to us.
I read and re-read Longfellow's poem with ever-increasing
interest. The traditions my father told me before 1 could spell I
find 'hanged in the poem. Longfellow did not spoil them by
over-coloring. The facts in themselves were romantic enough to
suit the feet's fancy. Hoivevtr, some of Prisdlla's character
istics are not mentioned. They are traits Priscilla developed
later in life, so it was not necessary for Longfellow to teil that
Priscilla had the quickest temper and was the best cook m
Plymouth.
There is a pretty little sequel to the courtship of MQ*t
Stcndish that is known only in the Alden family. Miles Stand
ish, when the wound that Priscilla had made in his heart had
healed, married another.
Years after, the son of Miles Standish married a daughter
of Priscilla and John Alden. There is a poetical justice about this
that we always love to dwell on.
A year or two ago I met a lady, a lineal descendant
of Captain Miles Standish. She had heard of me, and came to
Oakland "just to shake hands," as she said, "with a descendant
of John Alden"
You can imagine how strangely we both felt. Miles Stand
ish. Priscilla and John Alden seemed to step out of the past and
bless our meeting.
(ZAtit^ Qsujc<j&&^ 6CÂ£c/u^_

That la the v.ay with you men; you don't nn

With such decisive speeches does Long
fellow throw true light and shade on Prls
ellla'i character. There are strokes that
show her now arch, now earnest. Once he
almost betrays the <julck temper of his
ancestress. Of Miles Standish he make*
her say: "He Is a little chimney, and
heated hot In -x moment."
Prlscllla's saylnÃs have pÂ«s?ed from Up
to lip through the Kereratlons In her fam
ily. Longfellow nave them a poetical
flavor, but* the kernel was given him by
his mother. Her reply to John Alden.
"Why don't you speak for yourself,
John?" has passed from mother to daugh
ter even to this generation. Longfellow
built the poem on this naive reply, and
first called it "Pr'.scllla." later changing
it to "The Courtship of Miles Standlsh."
There Is another Interesting fact which
Miss Alden has been told by her father,
who bad it from hit lather before him]
and â Â» en bar* Into the nhMnwn Â«f thÂ«
past. Prlsdlla was the best cook In Ply
mouth. John Alden died In 16S* at thÂ«
ago of II years, and was the last survivor
of the original band of emigrants. Hli
descendants ascribe his longevity end
good health to his wife's excellent culin
ary powers. "Plea like PrUcllla used tÂ»
make" Is a family adage.

A Men In our midst. It lendj a new
charm to the poem,YE OCDE AND GOODBYE CUSTOM OF YE THANKSGIVING DAY
rorryright,
WHEN old Governor P.raAtorA of
th* Puritan colony â¢' Plymouth,
on the completion of thÂ» Pil
grims' first harvest In 1821. cent
out four fowlers In Â»?*rch of
ram* that al! the colonists might after
k more ftp- rial manner rejoice together,
Â little thoutcht that be wa* #wtahlienlng
in annual ! holiday which, under the name
*f Thankspivirg 'lay, was destined to be
â¢f,me an occasion universally observed
&} a ration of 60.000.000 people. From
P;ymojth thÂ« observance spread to the
adjoining colony of -Massachusetts Bay
uid thence 10 the other New England
â¢olonlea until It soon became customary
for ell their Governors to annually pro-
Ja.'m it.
The growth of Thanksgiving day ' out
â¢Jde of New England was very slow and
wven now it is a much more important
boliday In that section than In any other
part tft our â¢mm tin xiw sun m jritrv
tans frowned upon Christmas and all
other church festivals and crowded Into
the observance of their own Thanksgiving
day all the feasting and rejoicing which
people of different . religious views were
accustomed to distribute" over all the re
ligious holidays of the entire year. They
relaxed something of their severity on
that day ana within certain limits permit
ted their young people to make merry.
One of the statutes of the colonies of
Plymouth and Massachusetts Bay pro
hibited all game* of chance except back
garrtmon and bowlsâ the latter a sort of
modified tmpinsâ and all musical Instru
ments except the drum. Jewsharp and
trumpet. Playing at these permitted di
versions and upon those exempted instru
ments was freely indulged In on Thanks
giving day and the young folks were also
permitted to play at some of the old
English fireside games. " Thus Thanksgiv
ing among the early Puritan v.iiÂ» a Jay
nor Â«ty of i eiiM imlbw iv \m m â â  re
markable liberty as well.
In this connection Cotton Mather tells
an amusing story of some young men
members cf the Church of Englandâ who,
on the flrÂ»t Thanksgiving day after .their
arrival In Plymouth from the mother
country, engaged In their ordinary . avo
cations until they were prevented from
doing so by order of Governor Bradford.
When Christmas day came, to which, as
already etalad, the Puritans paid no at
tention whatever, calmly pursuing their
usual employments, the same young men
refused to work for the reason that It
was against their conscience to labor on
that religious festival. Governor Brad
ford told them that If such were the case
he would excuse them till they were bet
ter Informed. Soon afterward he found
them all at play In the street, whereupon
he took possession of the Implements- of
their games. saying that It was against
hi* conscience that they should play
THE SUNDAY CALL.
t>wWlÂ« ! all
other* were
at work and
that. If they had
any reverence for
Christmas day they
must pass It at home In
relljflous exercises.
Attendance upon two Church
Mrvlces, morning and after
noon, was thÂ« most important
part of thÂ« celebration of Thanks
gtvtng day among thÂ« early Puritans.
Each of these services was three hours
In lÂ«ngth. They began with a fifteen
minute prayer by the pnstor, followed by
thÂ« reading and exposition of a chapter
from the Bible, the singing of psalm* and
a aermon an hour and a half In length.
The psalms sung were dlctnted, line by
iine. to the congregation, who sang e*ch
line as it was given to them. The p<-rson
performing this "lining out" wai usually
remunerated for it by being excused from
paying that tax for the support of the
Congregational church which in the New
England colonies all persons, no matter
of what religious belief, were required to
pay. This congrrpationnl psalm singing
and lining out were continual by many of
the < Y.n^repational churches of New Eng
land until nrarly a quarter of a century
apo. "Singing seata" and choirs to occupy
them met with very great opposition when
they were first Introduced Into thÂ» "meet
ThS Ftps* Orjs gVfcp-Ctfsbwt^d arjd Us Oi'TS.TnatO!'.
txw-honies," as the Puritan* called their
churches.
There has been handed down through
many generations an amusing anecdote of
one of my progenitors, the Rev. Dr. Job
Strong:, who for many years wa3 pastor
of the Congregational church at Ports
mouth. N. H., where he began his pastor
ate in 1743. He was very bitterly opposed
to the innovation of a choir, but 'was at
length overruled by the members of his
"meeting," and a choir was organized
among the young people. . It made its first
appearance In the "singing seats" at the
morning service on Thanksgiving day }in
the year 1762. After Its members had Bung,
to a new fangled, very florid tune, the
psalm which had been given out, the Rev.
Job leaned over the pulpit and, beckon
ing to the Whole congregation with ex
tended arms, exclaimed earnestly: "Now
let the people of God -sing." He lad off
with a good old-fashioned psalm tune. In
which the whole congregation* Joined with
hearty good will. The "singing seat*"
were quickly vacated. Nothing more van
ever heard of the choir, and , congrega
tional singing continued In the Ports
mouth church for more than a century
afterward. â¢ - r.*'w:i
Thank3Riving being a joyous festival,
marriages were frequently celebrated on
that day throughout New England for
many years, there being a superstition,
handed down from early Puritan times,
that couples ' married on Thanksgiving
would be certain to enjoy happiness and
good fortune throughout their marriea
life. As a child I have often heard my
great-grandmother describe the costume of
the bride and groom at thÂ« Thanksgiving
day wedding of her oldest- Bister, which,
In her girlhood, thÂ« . attended in Ply
mouth, now more than 115 yean ago. The
bride's long locks were strained upward
over an immense cushion th.at sat like .>rÂ»
Incubus on her head, were plastered with
pomatum and sprinkled over with a
shower of white powder, the whole form
ing a tower over a foot In height. A
single white rosebud lay upon the summit
of this hirsute monument like a dove that
had newly lighted upon a parlan column.
Over her neck and bosom was folded a
lace kerchief, fastened In front by
a bosom pin rather larger than a silver
dollar and consisting of the bridegroom's
miniature set In virgin gold. Her airy
form; was laced up in a satin dress, its
sleeves as tight to the arm as the natural
skin, with a waist formed by a bodice '
worn outside of the flowing skirt, which
was distended at the ankles by an ample
hoop. Shoes of white kid with peaked
toes and heels two or tnree Inches in
height inclosed her feet and glittered with
spangles as her little pedal members
peeped curiously out.
The bridegroom's hair was sleeked
back, plentifully bepowdered and twisted
up Into a queue which projected like thÂ»
handle of a skillet. A skillful barber had
devoted a whole afternoon to perfecting
these tor.sorial arrangements, and the
victim of them . had passed the night be
fore his wedding morning in an arm-chah
lest they- should be disturbed. The bride
groom's coat was of sky-blue silk, lined
with' yellow. His long vest of white satin
was embroidered with gold lace. His
breeches, also of white satin, were of tne
lame material and were tied at the knees
with pink ribbon. White silk stockings
and pumps, with clocks and ties of the
same hue, completed the habiliment* of
bis nether limbs.
Lace ruffles clustered around his wrists,
and a portentous frill, bearing a large
miniature of his beloved, completed hM
truly genteel app-arancp.
It Is a remarkable faot and one but ltV
tie known that the first duel ever fought
In this country occurred in the colony ci
Plymouth during Governor Bradford*
term of office. It was between two men
servants, who foutrht with swords. Both,
duellists were slightly wounded. The
cause of thÂ«:-r quarrel ha? not been re
corded, but from an old k-tter written by
one of my ancestors to a relative in Eng
land and carefully treasured for more
than two centuries, I learn that "they
were adjudged by the whole company te
have their heads and feet tied together,
and so to lie for twenty-four hours, with
out meat or drink, which was begun to be
Inflicted, but within an hourâ because of
their great painsâ at. their own and their
master's hrmhle i .quest, upon promise
of better carriage, they were released by
>c Governor."
The first sreneral Thanksgiving day ap
pointed for the country at larg* cutslde
of New England was recommended In 177f
by the Continental Congress, which body
subsequently recommend -d a similar ob
servance annually throughout the revolu
tionary war, In 1753 VJrashington pro
claimed a general Thanksgiving day fo*
the adoption of the constitution, while the
suppression of the whisky insurrection In
Western Pennsylvania in 1795 caused hint
to proclaim another in that year.
The termination of the war of 1811
moved President Madison to proclaim one
In ISIS. No President ever appointed a.
Thanksgiving day for a war victory until
Abraham Lincoln did so in IM2. In the
following year he proclaimed the first na
tional Thanksgiving day for general bless
ings, and continued to do 30 ajinually
throughout his term of office Hit eximÂ«
pie has been followed by every succeed
ing President.

HOW TO PREPARE THANKSGIVING DINNER
P. â  . T*irinl<s::lvir.ff does not

â¢;!es and fir the brightening of pV.T<nn:
mfinoriri anil association?, nnd although
ro!lcloi:s observance is not so marked n~
in former years, the spirit of the day !s
the wnio.
In Tl â¢ â¢*:Â«>â¢Â« when rroat-creat-:;raiiup:*m
was coartlng sront-JZroat-srandman'.ii th*
preparation nf tho nil-Important part of
the day's celebration, the <lin!irr. was no
small thing. Ties, puddings Rtjd i-akes
were made wnks ahead: mincemeat was
not thotiÃht to have attained perfection
ur>Â»s made early In October, and Rrla
elllc.-j and Penelopes were kept busy pool
ing apples or mixing cake so that when the
day for foastinp came the pantry shelves
of nU well -regulated households were
wojphed down with Rood thinÃs. Thanks^
Riving was to our Puritan ancestors a day
of roÂ«t as well as of feasting and they
began early so dinner that bud to !>â¢â > pr.*
pared on the day took little time and
work.
Nowadays It !s different nnd the busy
housewife rather dreads this dinner, un
less she po.-.s< ?ses .1 bijou of .1 cook, and
makes it '-auso hor a deal <>f trouble atnl
worry. It is needless^ this trouble and
worry, if you only follow In lÂ»'.o footsteps
of tho Puritan housewives and begin ear
ly. Procrastination; somebody has wisely
f-a.id. Is the thief of time. Have the pud
dings, the cakes and tho pios out of the
way and on Thanksgiving day when you
come to pet tho dinner it will almost pet
itself; the cooking of tho turkey Is not
much trouble, and the preparation of an
ontrep or two will take only an hour or so
in the momirip. With the dessert ready
ar.d the sauco and fruit to be put in the
dishes and Just the table to set. the dinner
is a small mattor and you are not quite a
fit subject for a doctor when night comes.
For the Thanksgiving dinner many peo
ple prefer to have the regular old-fash
ioned New England dinner, with the
dishes purely American. Perhaps it Is a
more acceptable idea, as the day is dis
tinctly national, and nothing can be more
attractive than an old-fashioned bountiful
New England Thanksgiving dinner. The
following menu Is a typical one:
RotMÂ»d Turkey. Chicken Tie.
BaYed Totatoo?. Srjua*h. Turntj>s. Onions,
Cranberry Sauce.
Brown Bread. Whit* Bread.
Appl* Tie. Mtr.ce Pie. Pump Win Pi*.
Plum Puddtn*.
Arr'Â«*. Â«"ake. Nut? and Raisins,
T<*a and Coffee.
Remember that the success of your din

man:. of serving, and it would pay those
who are not quite sure to "study up."

'How long- was that, general?"
Again the weary iiands. with their long,
tapering lingers, came up to the old sol

think, but I can't be rare."
"And you had left them ?"
"In the inside pocket of that old over

studying his face the whilo. The letter
bore no clew as to the whereabouts of the
writer. It read: . . *

CHAPTER XII.
Opinion was divided at Camp Merrltt as
to whether Billy Gray should or should,
not stand trial. Contident as were his
friends of his Innocence of all complicity
in Morton's escape, there remained the
tact that he had telephoned for â  car
riage, thai a carriage had come and that
a carriage with four men. apparently .-"1
diers, had driven rapidly lownward alone
I'oint Lobos avenue. It was seen by half
a dozen policemen as it shot under elec
tric light or gas lamp. Then there was the
bundle Inside Jjis rolled overcoat that
Gray had personally handed Morton when
a prisoner. Everybody agreed he should
have Bent It by orderlyâ everybody, that
Is, except some scores of young soldiers
in the ranks who could see no harm In
it having been done thai way, especially
two "Delta Bigs" In the â tee.nth. Then
there were the long conferences In the
dark. What did they mean? All things
considered the older and wiser heads saw
that, as the lieutenant could or would
make no satisfactory explanation of these
to his colonel, he must to a court â or take
the consequences.
"You've made a mess of the thing and
an ass of yourself. Billy." was Gordon's
comprehensive if not consolatory sum
mary of the matter, "and as Canker has
been rapped for one thing or another by
camp, division and brigade commanders,
one after another, he feels that be's got
to prove that he Isn't the only fool In the
business, You'd better employ a good
counsel and prepare for a fight."
"Can't afford It." said Billy briefly,
"and I'm blowed if I'll ask my dear old
dad to come to the rescue. He's had to
cough up (shame on your slang. Billy far
too much already, i 1. 11 you, Gordon.
I'm so fixed thai I can't explain these
things miles. I'm actually brought to
trial. It'sâ wellâ you have no secret
societies at the Point ns we do at college,
so you can't fathom It. I'm no more
afraid of standing trial than I am of
Bqueers- be dâ d to him!"
"Good Laird, youngsterâ youâ you aren't
quite such an ass as to suppose a court
is going to regard any schoolboy obliga
tion as paramount to that which your
oath of omr< demands. Look hyuh. Billy,
your head's just addled! I can't work on
you, but somebody must!"
And Gordon went away very low in his
mind. He liked thai boy. He loved a
keen, alert, snappy soldier on drill, and
Billy had no superior in the battalion
when it came to handling squad or com
pany. The adjutant plainly saw the peril
of his position and further consultation
with his brother officers contlrmed him in
his fears. Schuyier. the brigade commis
sary, being much with the teenthâ
messing with them. In tact, when he was
not dancing attendance on Miss Prime
heard all this camp talk and told her.
Thus it happened that the very next day
when he drove with the cousins (Mr.
Prime being the while in conference with
the detectives still scouring the city for
the young deserter, whom the father now
felt confident was his missing boy). Mlsn
Lawrence looked the captain full in the
fare with her clear, searching eyes and
plumped at him the point blank question:
"Captain Schuyier, do Mr. Gray's
brother officers really consider him in
danger of dismissal?"
"Miss Lawrence. I grieve to say that not
one has any other opinion now."
There could be no doubt of it. Amy
Lawrence turned very pale and her beau
tiful eyes filled.
"It id a shame," she said after a mo
ment's struggle to conquer the trembling
of her lips. "Hasâ ls there no oneâin
fluential enoughâ or with brains enough
(this with returning color) to take up his
case and clear him?"
They were whirling through the beau
tiful drive of Golden date Park, pass
ing company after company at drill. Even
as Amy .spoke Schuyler lifted his cap and
Miss Prime bowed and smiled. A group
of regimental officers, four in number,
stood, apparently supervising the work,
and as Miss Lawrence quickly turned to
pee who they might be. her eyes met those
of Colonel Armstrong. Five minutes
later the carriage, returning, drew up as
though by some order from Its occupants,
at that very spot. Armstrong and his ad
jutant were still there and promptly
Joined them.
Long weeks afterward that morning

the stalwart, soldier ii.uantly to Amy's
side. Her. gaze, was upon him before the
carriage stopped, ami irresistibly drew

emotion he could not subdue, though his

but about that sweet and .flushing face
there shone the halo of â  woman's brave

toward him she spoke Mildred Prime
could not repress n little gasp of amaze.
"Colonel Armstrong, will you kindly

Without a word he wrenched the handle

She drew a long breath. She seemed to

And Canker cam* and listened. It was

was, out.slae the army, on the samo

time and again, leaning on thÂ»j arm <â¢*
Captain McDonald, a new devotee, whtlo
poor Cherry, with an enamored swain
from the Presidio, languished in a dim.
secluded corner. She had been recalled
by parental authority and was to start
for Denver under a matronly wing on tho
morrow. Mrs. Frank had been bidden,
and expected, to go at the some time, but
that authority was merely marital. ; ;.
to this time not one urmy wife had be'-n
permitted to accompany her husband on
any of tho transports to Manila, though
one heroine managed to k--' carried away
and to share her liege lor.i h stateroom

staff, with a big regiment of Volunteers,
were to sail on th. morrow, the other
regiments as fast as transports could be
coaled and made ready.
Something In Mrs. Garrison's gay. tri
umphant manner prompted a sore
hearted woman, suffering herself at the
coming parting, to turn and say: "Well,
Mrs. Garrison, I suppose that after your
husband sails you'll have to follow tho
rest of us Into grass widowhood."
One thing that made women hate Mnr

cuttingly, as It was meant to go, even
though a merry laugh wet with It.
"Not I! When the ship 1 want Is ready

But as she turned triumphantly away

there was an Instant's falter. As though

stood looking sternly into her eyes.

Still another expedition was destined to
start for Manila, and keen wan the ri

current in the camps that the next re
view was to decide the matter, and that
the commands pronounced to be foremost
In discipline and efllciency would be des

had conveyed the earlier expeditions to

to get away was Stanley Armstrong: and

every wire to secure the longed-for or

when, all on a sudden, the hopes of all
were crushed Spain had begred for
peace. "No more men can be sent to Ma

Camp Merritt put on mourning forth
with.
But Armstrong had been studying the
situation and was not easily daunted. !(â¢â >
was a man whose opinion carried weight
and from the very first he had maintained
that while 13.000 or -aj/oo might be men
enough to hold Manila. 50.0W might not
be enough to subdue at once the forces
of Aiculnaldo In case they should turn
upon the Americans, which, said he. pia
cldly. they will most certainly do beforo
we are a year older.
The Dudes, therefore, much to their dis
gust, were kept steadily at work. Other
regiments, profiting by example, followed
suit; but In others still a small proportion
of their membership, believing, -s th*y
said, that the "Jig was up." took to law
less and unhallowed expression of their
disgust and became thereby a nulsunco
to the neighborhood. San Franciscans,
who had wept copiously when others
sailed away, would have seen the*<Â» pa
triots sent Into exile without shedding a
tear. * *
"Every man of this command will yet be
needed and yet be sent." said Armstrong.
fco. too, did the veteran division com
mander, and the brigade took hiart ac
cordingly. The last of the regulars, with
the recruit detachments for r^-jrlments al
ready In the Philippines, had been shipped
to Honolulu, there to await orders, and
September seemed destined to go by with

at last that the boy they sought was not

down to hard and constant work wan

not care that the mornings no longer
brought with them the carriage and th*
fair face of that gentle girl: the depart

take a look at his new responsibilities in
Hawaii: little Mrs. Garrison still held
court, though with diminished retinue, at
the Presidio, when one day, Just as Octo
ber was ushered In, there came a mes
sage from the adjutant general In town.
Would Armstrong drop in at the office at
the first opportunity, A matter of somo
Importance had come up tn the general's

Armstrong's opinion was desired; and tn# ,

for the Phelnn building. The adjutant
general looked up from a littered desk as
Armstrong entered.
"It Is good of you to me so prompt

truth, and I want your advice." Then h*
tapped his bell. "Excuse me to'nny ono
who come* for the next ten minutes."
said he to the attendant who entered "I

No sooner did the orderly vanish than
the man of the desk whirled full on tho
man of the saddle. "Armstrong." said he

Morrison I. Swift's "Imperialism and
Liberty" is a bitter attack from every
possible direction upon the policy of ex
tending the dominion of the United States
to the Philippines. He assaults the Idea
of imperialism us in Itself degrading: he
maintains that the declaration of Ameri
can sovereignty over the inlands was a
treacherous breach of faith: he proclaims
the danger to freedom and manhood in
volved In military methods: he insists
upon the dcâ orallzation and expense of
war: he declares that the only origin of
thÂ» present war is the greed of capitalists.
He attacks the press for using expansion
as a newspaper scoop: he blames the gen
erals for sacrificing the highest interests
of their country to personal ambition; he
condemns the War Department as a seat
of corruption and a magazine of lies, and
he assails the President as the hypocriti
cal tool, agent, defender, abettor, cause
and promoter of the fraud, tyranny,
slaughter, anarchy and corruption which
he asserts to have been connected with or
| created by the Philippine policy of the ad
ministration. There la of course much dif
ference of opinion a to the Justice of thÂ«
views* held by Mr. Swiff. The author of
this review unhesitatingly proclaims him
self that derided and obsolete being, an
anti-expansionist. But he cannot let pass
without a word of indignant condemna
tion Mr. Swift's outrageous violence.
"Roaring Cornanche." "strident nias
j phemy.." "half-monkey." are mild words
In Mr. Swift's vocabulary. This vitupera
tion converts no one who does not already
believe, and i may drive even him away
in disgust. Still less excusable Is thÂ«
1 wholesale condemnation of men who ara

QUEER CASES or VESSELS

It seems passing strange considering
the enormous amount of ocean traffic
carried on nowadays that it should be
possible for .1 vessel to put out to sea In

terles as the fates of thÂ« % >Â« vessels, which,

happiness, wealth and all the Joys of life,
never reach their destination and are
never again heard of.

Equally mysterious Is the case of the

I Kngland and America at the time. It
' mlgni imj thought that the terrific seas of
