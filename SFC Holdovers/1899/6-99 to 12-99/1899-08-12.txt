VANCOUVER; B. >'.. Aug. 11.
âIt is probable that the majority
of the sailorson board the Cai lisle
Castle were eaten by sharks as
they vainly tried to swim shore
from their wreck, just outside of
Perth, in West Australia. Safety
Bay is a noted remit for sharks
from the fishing grounds, and as
it had been exceedingly rough
for several days before the
wreck the sharks evidenced
many ravenous propensities to
the people ho tried to rescue
some of the sailors by going out
in boats. Some human bones
were found in shallow water,
one being a collar-bone, with
some shreds of flesh hanging to
it. Other pieces of two bodies
were washed up to show the
terrible carnage that had taken
place after the men of the Car
lisle Castle had been washed
overboard.

The storm which was the severest
ever experienced here, descended upon
the city from the northeast at 9 o'clock
Tuesday morning and lasted two hours.
, All the buildings were damaged and
hundreds were totally destroyed. Fif
teen vessels in the harbor were driven
I ashore. The city was flooded by mid

stroyed.
The city is short of food and army
officers are distributing rations. Out
side of this bananas are the only ob
tainable food. Supplies of drinking
water, gas and electric light have bo- n
cut off by the storm. The sanitary con

He said the hurricane had traveled
about 1200 miles in four days, or about
1.00 miles a day. Hurricane signals have |

SANTIAGO, Aug. 11.â A severe wind
and rain storm, the heaviest known in
fifteen years, struck this city yester
day. The rain was accompanied by j
vivid lightning and deluged the town |
for twenty-four hours without cessa
tion. Some damage was done in the
lower part of the city, several streets
being -washed out and houses under- i
mined. The soldiers in various camps ;
suffered some discomfort. About half j
of the tents were blown down.
FEARFUL HAVOC
WROUGHT BY HURRICANE
WASHINGTON, Aug. 11â A report
has been received at the War Depart
ment from an officer at San Juan. Porto
Rico, estimating that the number of
killed amounts to 500. The same officer
says that a very serious condition of af
fairs exists in Ponce.
The War Department received a
cablegram from General Davis giving
fuller details of the damage done in
Porto Rico by the hurricane-
General Davis says a famine is im
pending, and asks authority to issue
rations to the destitute. The message
is dated yesterday and says:
"Later reports show that the hurri
cane was far more severe in the inte
rior and southern part of the island
than here. Data for an estimate of the
number of Porto Ricans who have lost
everything are deficient, but I am forced
to believe that the number on the island
cannot fall below 100,000 souls, and a
famine is impending. I ask that 2,500,
--000 pounds of rice and beans, equal
quantities of each, be immediately
shipped on transports to Ponce; some
here. Urgent appeals are made to all
post commanders for food for the desti
tute. I am authorized to relieve dis
tress by food issued; rice and beans
only desired. There have been many
deaths of natives by falling walls. So
far only one soldier reported danger
ously, injured. Several towns reported
entirely demolished, as yet, however,
reports from only seaports. Complete
destruction of all barracks at two
towns, and two others one com
pany of eachâ had barracks de
stroyed. Troops are in canvas. No re
ports yet from the largest portsâ Ponce
and Mayaguez, but they were in the
vortex of the storm. At least half of
the people in Porto Rico subsist entirely
on fruit and vegetables, and the storm
has entirely destroyed this source of
support. . DAVIS." *
The War Department has taken
prompt action on General Davis' report.
The army transport McPherson has
been ordered to sail from New York to
San Juan and Ponce next Monday with
supplies to relieve the destitute In Porto
Rico. Acting Commissary General Wes
ton has ordered the purchase in New
York of 600,000 pounds of rice and 600,

LOUISVILLE, Ky., Aug. 11â local

James Dunham, the sextuple murderer
wanted in California. About a week ago
a suspect was arrested here and a pho

lowing telegram from Sheriff R. J. Lang
ford at San Jose, Cal.:

The prisoner has the scar indicated.
When arrested he gave the name of E.
Z. Netherfleld and claimed to be from
SAN JOSE, Aug. There is some
doubt in the minds of the local officers
that F C Netterfleld. under arrest at
Louisville, Ky.. is James C. Dunham, the
murderer of the McGlincy family. Pho
tographs of the suspect were examined by
i a great many people to-day \\ bile some
who knew Dunham intimately are con
vince,! the right man has been arrested
the majority are in doubt. It is general
ly admitted there is a strong resemblance
to Dunham in the photographs.
A dispatch was received from the, Louis
ville authorities this forenoon- asking that
a warrant be sent immediately, and it is
supposed some difficulty is being'experi
enced in holding the man. . â¢ . .
A local barber . who frequently shaved
Dunham notified the Sheriff's office that
the murderer had -a. scar back of the right
ear and telegraphic inquiry, developed, the
fact that Netterfleld has a similar scar.
When arrested Netterfleld said he came
from Warren, Ohio. To-day I. E. Brig
den called at the Sheriff's office and said
that many years ago he knew a person
named Netterfleld In Warren. The Louis
ville authorities were asked to consult
the authorities at Warren, but as yet no
answer has been received. Stronger proof
than that now in the hands of the Sher
iff must be forthcoming before any one
will be sent East to identify the suspect.
FEW MEN WILLING TO
ENLIST IN THE SOUTH
LOS ANGELES, Aug. 11.â The fact that
I Lieutenant Louis Chappelear of the Thir
; ty-fifth Volunteers, who has been recruit
ing for that regiment in Los Angeles, has
been ordered to Santa Ana to continue his
labors caused much comment in National
Guard circles. It is intimated that the
Government is in need of men to supply
this regiment and that the smaller towns
of Southern California will be scoured for
material. Recruiting for the regular ser
vice has not been popular in this portion
of the State, therefore it seems as if in
towns where companies of â¢ the Seventh
Regiment remain no further attempts will
be made.
In commenting upon the present efforts
to subdue Agulnaldo's forces and the pos-
I sible number of men that may be required,
! former Senator Stephen M. White said to
a group of gentlemen that his views on
expansion and the so-called imperial pol
icy were well known, as he had made him
self clear in and out of Congress on the
question. Senator White favors, since the
i Government is in the conflict, the sending
lof a large' army to the Philippines. "If it
I takes 200,000 men they had better be sent,"
I Senator White is quoted as saying, "for
j then there will be no battle fought, as the
1 army will march through Luzon and take
It. Let all the mÂ«n be sent that are need
ed so that an immense army can quickly
â¢do the business. Less bloodshed and mis
j cry will result."

DAYTON SYSTEM TO BE TRIED.
Stockton Building Association Adopts
the Co-operative Plan.
STOCKTON. Aug. 11.â stockholders
of the San Joaquin Building and Loan
Association have voted to reorganize
under what is known as the Dayton sys
tem. The system is that of a savings
bank operated upon the co-operative plan.
Persons may take stock at any time with
out paying back dues. Interest is charged
to the person who gets a loan only from
the time the money is paid him. All divi
dends are credited on the books of the
members every six months. A borrower
may pay off his loan at any time. A
member may withdraw part of his de
posit without disturbing his shares. A j
person may pay up one or more shares j
of stock in full at one deposit. On paid
up stock the dividends are paid in cash i
semi-annually. No initiation fees are

each member every six months and cred
its his earnings, showing the full amount
he has on deposit. At the end of each
year the borrower's lÂ©ok is balanced and
shows him the amount he has paid on his
loan for the preceding year and the bal
ance due.
The plan takes Its name from the well
known Ohio city, where, out of a popula

cording to late advices from
cording to late advices from Aus-
Xl tralia Count and Countess Ru
it dolph Festetics narrowly escaped
death at the hands of Solomon
Island cannibals a little over a month
ago. The Festeticses arrived at Sydney
on the yacht Tolna after a most re
markable experience, and ready to
give up all further attempts to explore
the wild islands of the South Seas.
The Count and Countess have been
aging for the last year south of
Honolulu, and their adventures in the
Solomons ended a very hard trip. A
few months ago a party of traders were
murdered on the coast of one of the fa
mous group of islands, but, not deterred
by this, the Count witnessed several
head-hunting expeditions.
"We landed on Wango Island the 3d of
July," he said, in telling the story of
the trip, "and immediately tried to
make friends with the natives. Wo
pulled our steam yacht up a small
creek, and we were right away sur
rounded by a crowd of curious natives.
They were not only curious but impu
dent, and they started to walk away
with nearly everything they could lay
their hands upon. We had not been on
the island two days when a small war
began. The tribes on opposite sides of
even these small islands always seemed
to be at war. They did not fight in
open battle, though the men are phy
sically well formed, but they would
pounce down on small camps of the na
tives, their enemies, kill as many as
they could and carry away the rest of
them for a future feast."
The Count followed one of these par
, ties on the fourth day after his arrival.
i The natives were armed with spears,
I and, stealthily creeping through the
I underbrush, they took their enemies en
tirely by surprise. They captured eight
1 of the men and two women, killing as
: many more in the attack. Then they
: brought them back to the native village
I amid a great rejoicing and beating of
| drums. The victims were tied securely,
I and early the next morning they were
; carried out to the chief's private yard
to be executed. They were ranged along
in a line and were decapitated one after
another, just to show that there was no
hurry about the proceeding. The chief
; in the meantime sat and looked on and
; had the gory heads of his victims
] brought and placed on the top of the
I stockade fence that surrounded his hut.
Count Festetics had no trouble in se
curing good photographs of this pro
ceeding, including the cannibal feast. In
which the bodies of the victims were
being dragged to the fire to be cooked.
"They had just completed the execu
tion and were preparing for the feast
when the tables were turned." continued
the Count, in his narrative. "The friends
of the captured men came down to
avenge their loss, and succeeded in
staying the execution of a couple. They
killed some of the men of the tribe I
was with, and the remainder fled. The
feast had been half prepared, and the
newly arrived enemies mingled dead foes

ADVENTURES OF THE
FESTETICS ON TOLNA
The yacht Tolna sailed from San Fran
cisco on October 9, 1893, and although she
and the Count and Countess Festetlcs
have been heard from frequently, but one
of them, the Countess, has been back in
San Francisco since. That was last year,
and on that occasion the Countess left the
Tolna and the Count in Yokohama while:
she made a run to New York to visit her
mother. Rumor had it at the time that
she had returned to secure a divorce from
Festetics, but all that was proved to be
idle gossip when the next Mail steamer
took her back to the Tolna and her hus
band. Since then th..* couple have been
sailing from island to island in the South
ern Seas, sometimes going over old ground
and again seeking new fields to explore,
â¢ but always going where fancy led.
The Tolna was built at Benicia. She is
nearly 79 tons net burden, SS feet long, 24
feet 5 inches broad and 11 feet deep. She
was built for comfort, not for speed, and
her cabin was made as cozy as money and
good taste could make it. While the ves
sel was being constructed the Count was
taking lessons in navigation in a naval
school, and finally succeeded in passing as
a master mariner. Much to his dismay.
however, he found that i foreigner could
not command an American vessel. The
Countess came to the rescue. She took j
out a license as master and cleared the j
yacht. On the records of the Custom- ;
house to-day the Countess Festetics de !
Tolna appears as master of the yacht Tol
na; and will so remain until the vessel Is
sold; lost or a new skipper appointed.
About the time the Tolna was ready tor
sea the Count's purse gave out. and at
tachments were levied on the ship In doz
ens. All the bills were eventually paid
and the yacht sailed, with the former
society belle in command.
Th.* Hawaiian Islands were first visited.
and excursions were made to all the isl- j
ands of the group. When they tired of
the Paradise of the Pacific, Navigator
Countess Festetics turned the prow of the
Tolna toward the Southern Seas. Samoa,
Tonga Fiji, New Zealand and Australia
were visited in turn. Then, in September.
-..â¢.. i came the news from Tahiti that
Count Festetics was dead. II was said |
that he had passed away on Penrhyn Isl
and and that the schooner had been sold
to a trader and the Countess was on her
way home. The story was later proved to
be without foundation. The Count and |
Countess had visited the island on the j
Tolna, but were safe and well in Papeete |
â when the news as circulated.
From Tahiti the Count and Countess
went to Guam, then to the Philippines.
From Manila they went to Nagasaki, and
there the Countess left the yacht and go

MURDEROUS MANIAC
WITH A REVOLVER
Attempts Two Assassinations and
Then Ends His Own Life With
a Bullet.
CHARLOTTESBURG, Prussia, Aug.
11.â At the branch of the Credit" Bank
here to-day. Dr. Proen, a retired army
captain and former president of the
Hamburg Marine Office, after present
ing a check for payment, discharged a
revolver at a bank director and a clerk,
dangerously wounding both. He then
jumped into a train and alighted at the
Zoological Garden, where he fired at an
official who tried to bar his entrance.
He then pressed the muzzle of the re
volver against his own temple and
rapidly fired three shots, falling dead.
No motive is assigned for his conduct
and he is supposed to have been in
sane.

McNAUGHTO N NOT
YET TRIUMPHANT
Alumni Will Appeal to ;
the Governor.
â â¢â â
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAX JOSE, Aug. 11.â The investigating '
committee of the Alumni Association of '.
the State Normal School does not propose i
to allow the charges made against Princi
pal James McNaughton to die with the ;
whitewashing received at the hands of
the board of trustees, but will appeal to j
Governor Gage. The committee, consist- :
ing of J. G. Jury, Eli Wright and F. E. j
â¢."aril, is preparing fts case to lay it before
the Governor. A strong appeal will be i
made 'to the executive to interfere ami
save the school from destruction. All the
evidence collected to prove the immoral
ity, incompetency and unfitness of the new
principal will be forwarded to Sacra- j
mi nto, as will a long petition signed by j
prominent citizens, showing that if Mc- j
Naughton Is allowed to rule over the
school that institution will be irreparably
injured, and many thousands of dollars
spent by outside pupils will be diverted
from the channels of trade of this city.
In its letter to the Governor the com
mittee will claim that the preponderance
of proof was on its side, and that Instead
of trying to disprove th. charges Mc- \
ghton simply introduced a number of I
letters to prove his good character. Most j
of these letters were from persons who
had me. McNaughton after the charges
were made against him at Council Bluffs,
it will be urged that certain trustees had j
made up their minds to exonerate Mc- i .
Naughton before the investigation began. !
and as evidence the committee cites the j
fad that while th. investigation was 'ii
progress; and before one side had been
beard; the trustees gave McNaughton _.ili
control of the school and vested power in l
him to assign and reassign the teachers.
Governor Gage will be asked to reopen I
the case fend hear the evidence in person. i
â The committee is being encouraged in
Its work by the best people in the city. I
There Is some talk of holding a citizens' '
mass-meeting, and it may yet materialize.
It is now claimed that the board of trus- :
tees was not unanimous in declaring Mc- |
Naughton not guilty, but that the â  vote j
; stood three to three. Trustees Short' and j
'Pierce and State Superintendent Kirk, it'
is said, thought it would be to the best j
interests of the school to drop him. but j
Trustees Leavltt. Brown and Sweigert j
were obstinate and would not listen to
this. This report is borne out by the fact j
the resolutions adopted declaring Mc- |
Naughton not guilty were never signed, j
CHILD VICTIM OF
INDIAN WITCHCRAFT
Killed Because an Alaska Medicine
Man Declared It Contained
an Evil Spirit.
ASTORIA, Or., Aug. 11.âNotwith
standing the strenuous efforts put forth
by officials of Alaska to put a stop to
the barbarous practice of witchcraft
among the Indians and the recent se
vere punishment Inflicted on the In
dians for that crime, it continues to be
practiced. A case is reported from
KHllsno-o, wherein an Indian child was
made the victim of witchcraft supersti
tion, according to advices received to
day from Alaska.
An Indian woman was living in the
same house with the parents of the
child. For some months she had been
sick and at times suffering great agony.
She was waited upon by a shaman, or
Indian doctor, who went through vari
ous incantations, but failed to drive the
evil spirit out of the sick woman. Being
chagrined at his failure, and to main
tain his professional reputation, he told
the woman that stf was bewitched, and
before she could recover the witch had
to be removed. He told her that he
would that night commune with the
great spirit and ascertain who was lie
witching her. The next day he inform
ed her that it was the little child with
whose parents she was living, and for
her restoration to health the child must
be killed.
A few days later the child died so
suddenly that Â» its parents thought
something was wrong and reported the
matter to the authorities, who had the
body examined by a physician. He pro
nounced its death the result of poison
ing. The child's parents accused the
sick woman and the shaman of the
crime. She confessed, while the
shaman, before arrests could be
made, took the woman in a canoe
and disappeared. Warrants will be is
sued for their arrest, but as the sha
mans have great influence with the In
dians, and are looked upon with super
stitious awe, they will be kept out of
the way of the officers.

Finding of a Second Cartridge Indi

Special Dispatch to The Call. I
LINCOLN.Aug. 11. -The death of Frank ;
Landis transcends the ordinary and
, -iters the realm of the bizarre. That
the young man was murdered while at
tempting to guard his treasure seemed to
tit in comfortably with the circumstances
as they presented themselves. The over
turned lamp in the office, where stood the ,
safe containing the grocer's share of the |
cannery ' payday's benefits; the open back j
door, suggesting the mode of the rnur- .
derer's flight: the finding of Landis re
volver four feel from his body, with one
I of the five chambers empty, and the re
: covin of a bullet of corresponding caliber : i
in the ceiling overhead-all these circum
stances went to substantiate the quickly
accepted explanation that murder re
suited from a fierce struggle with some .
unknown robber. 'â Â£-.*â --Â
An autopsy was held on the body and :
the ball which had pierced the young i
man's heart was extracted from his
backbone. True, it was of the same
caliber as the ball imbedded in the ceil
ing but the incident only operated to i
strengthen the theory that murder had
defiled the peaceful little mountain town.
Of course it was a case of murder! How
could it have been otherwise, when only,
one Of five cartridges in Lambs' revolver
had been disturbed, while th. re were two I
bullets to be accounted forâ the one In
the ceiling and the one removed from the
young grocer's backbone? ... .â  ',*â¢.:â  |
* That was a bold man who questioned i
such pointed evidences of an assassin's
work. But a man did question it, and he
has won converts to his idea. Now
Lincoln is on the verge of accept
ing the suicide theory. The Sheriff ;
and his officers are wedded to it, and it |
would appear that they have ground for
their expressed belief that Frank Landis
killed himself after having carefully
planned to make it appear that some
mvsterlous assassin committed the deed. |
With one bullet taken from the ceiling j
and the other removed from Landis' j
body, and with but one cartridge out of!
the" five exploded in the young man's
revolver, only one thing could give color |
to the suicide theory. - â¢*,'-"
That one theory has eventuated. An '
empty cartridge shell has been found'
among th. boxes in Landis' store, not far!
from where his body lay. The shell bears
unmistakable signs of having recently
been relieved of its leaden pellet. The !
empty shell fits exactly into Landis' re
volver. How came that empty shell
where Lt was found? Is it probable the
murderer, after having been shot at, and
after having killed the young grocer, ,
paused sufficiently long in his flight to
take out the empty shell and throw it
away? If such a thing is probable, what
motive could have prompted that unnec
essary act? Is it not more likely that,
having reached his store, the young
grocer fired one shot into the ceiling,
threw the empty cartridge away, put an
other in Â«its place and then turned the
pistol against his own heart?
The case mystifies. If Landis killed him
self, he did more. He fired a shot into
the ceiling; he substituted the exploded ,
i cartridge with a fresh one; he overturned
| the lamp in his office; he unbarred the
i rear door; he showed the ingenuity of a ;
j playwright in completing so far as lay
I in his power the effect he desired to pro- j
I duce. But he neglected to hide effectu
i ally the cartridge which he exploded
| harmlessly and which is to-day held up â 
' as proof of self-murder.
There are some other circumstances
which the people of Lincoln regard as
I strange. Landis was never known to i
j touch liquor up to the night of his death. â¢
I That night he drank three glasses of
whisky in Matzen's saloon. Landis was
always of quiet deportment, never in- j
! dulging in marked levity. That fatal
I night, a few minutes before his death,
he stopped at the door of the News-Mes
; senger office and gave such an exhibition !
of high spirits that Editor Johnston re- I
marked the incident afterward. Yet no
known reason exists for self-murder. Tho j
officers assert that they are possessed of I
I information tending to substantiate the i
suicide theory; but what that information i
1 is they have not yet divulged.

Marin County Valuations.
SAN RAFAEL, Aug. 11.â An estimate of

jby County Recorder Eugene Connell. It

$11,409,054. It is divided as follows: San

SHERMAN'S COURSE FROM YOKOHAMA TO SAN FRANCISCO.
IN making San Francisco from Yokohama the United States transport Sherman, with the California boys aboard,
will probably cover 4650 knots. Each day she will cover from 290 to 300 knots, and if she does the soldiers
should be off the Farallones the afternoon of the 24th or early on the 25th.
The probable position of the Sherman each day at noon will be calculated for The Call by Lieutenant J. T.
McMillan, United States nautical expert in the Branch Hydrographic office. During the war with Spain he
went to Manila as navigating officer of the Nero when that vessel towed the Monterey over to join Dewey's fleet.
At noon yesterday (San Francisco time) Mr. McMillan calculates that the Sherman had covered 785 knots
and was about in latitude 37 degrees 50 minutes north, longitude 154 degrees 40 minutes east. She was therefore
3878 knots from this port.
On her last run from Nagasaki to San Francisco the Sherman took a little over eighteen days to cover the
distance This gave her an average of a little over 290 knots a day. Captain. Barneson of the transport service
thinks she will do a little better than that on this occasion, so that it is safe to figure on a run of sixteen days or
a little over from Yokohama.
HAS A MONOPOLY
ON SMALL BOATS
Captain McNeill's Coup
at Belvedere.
â  9â ;
Special Dispatch to The Call. ' .
BELVEDERE. Aug. 11.â A clash has
arisen between the executltve committee
having in charge the arrangements for
the "Night in Venice." to be held in the
cove on the night of September 2, on the
one hand-, and Captain Charles McNeill
on the other, which threatens seriously to
mar a salient feature of the celebration.
The knowledge of a wrangle will come as
a damper upon the enthusiasm of those
who have -contributed time and money to
further the project. * .>....... /
Former committees haying these car
nivals in charge have always contracted
with the boatmen of Sausalito, Tlburon,
El Campo and Belvedere for the use of
their boats, which have been hired out
to parties desiring to witness the pyro
technic display from advantageous posi
tions, and the revenue so derived has
helped in a great measure to meet ex
penses. McNeill was recently asked what
he would charge for the use of his gaso
line launch, the Norwood, on the night
of September 2, and set the figure at $2,*).
This was deemed too high, and he finally
agreed to let the committee use the
launch for three days prior to the carni
val for that figure, to be used in placing
yacht*, across th mouth of the cove.
This proposition also being rejected, Mc-
Neill made contracts with the boatmen
.if all four places for the use of their
boats during the carnival night. When
the committee tried to procure the boats
it was dumfounded to learn that it had
been outwitted by the shrewd skipper.
A meeting of the committee is to be
held when a discussion will take place
as to whether It will be better to try to
mollify McNeill or to bring boats' from
San Francisco. Neither horn of the
dilemma affords an inviting grasp, as the
expense of engaging boats and bringing
them here would amount to almost as
much as the revenue derived from their
use without any opposition, while Mc-
Neill's boats would cut largely into the
income. â  ?'â _".

McDONALD NOT
YET A POOR MAN
Such Is the Belief of His
Wife. ;
â â
Specftd Dispatch to -The Call.
VANCOUVER. B. C, Aug. 11. - Mrs.
Alexander McDonald, the wife of the
"King of the Klondike," is in Vancouver;
therefore she is not in Dawson, nor has
she ever been, contrary to the press ad
vices of to-day. She is here waiting for
the return of her husband, whom she ex
pects to come out by the Ist of next
month. She has no news at all of his
financial embarrassments, and places little
credence in the reports on which yester
day's dispatch was founded. The dispatch
states, in the first place, that McDonald
has been in the Klondike twenty years,
while, as a matter of fact, he has not been
there half that time. t^_Â«_i.-
In recent letters to his wife McDonald
made no statements as to the possible til- ,
ing of insolvency papers, and gave the de
cided impression that his business was in
good shape. Two of McDonald s princi
pal backers in recent schemes, Messrs.
Mitchell and Marshall, Scotch million
aires, recently passed through \ ancouver
from the Klondike, an* from the stand
point of the ordinary old-country share
holder they were delighted with, the sit
uation, and entered heartily into several
new schemes. __Â»_._.
The officials of the local banks which
have branches in Dawson laugh at the
idea of any Klondike man haying in any
conceivable way liabilities of $b,iK*>,ooo in
connection with the banks. __,-"__
VICTORIA, B. C, Aug. 11.â E. Mermen,
who has just returned from Dawson, con
tradicts the statement that Alexander \
McDonald has hied a notice of insolvency
in the Dawson courts. He is a personal
friend of McDonald, and says there is not
the slightest ground for the statement.
The day before he left one of McDonald s
mule trains came in from Bonanza with
i from 150 to 200' pounds of gold dust. 11 is
check is good for an almost limitless sum
iin any of the banks of Dawson, and the
! big fellow* is richer to-day than he ever
was in his life. '"'' ''â  ,_ _ . ..â
Mermen says McDonald has about sixty
lima on El Dorado, Bonanza, Dawson,
Sulphur, Hunker and other creeks. He
can ascribe no other reason than jealousy
for the report- circulated regarding Mc-
Donald's financial embarrassment. .
SEATTLE, Aug. 11.â In the absence of
confirmatory advices no credence is given
here to the repprl that Alexander Mc-
Donald, the Klondike king, is an insol
vent. So far as can be ascertained the
story of McDonald's statement is based
on the mere statement of Thomas Kil
kenny, a returning Klondiker, to the ef
fect that just before he left Dawson a
friend had' told him that McDonald had
filed a notice of insolvency at the court
house. A number of reputable Klondikers
who left Dawson subsequent to the date
on which McDonald is reported to have
filed his notice of insolvency say they
heard nothing of lt. and believe the story
has no foundation.

AT THE BRINK
OF THE CRATER
Perilous Trip of a New
York Man.
â â
, .... Special Dispatch to The Call.
VANCOUVER, B. C, Aug. Advices
from Honolulu by the steamship Miowera
to-day were that the Hilo volcano is mak
ing things decidedly interesting for every
one in Hawaii. One of the most venture
some trips to its smoking summit was
made by A. M. Atherton, who returned to
Honolulu the day the Miowera sailed for
Vancouver. Atherton is a photographer,
sent out with Professor Bickmore of the
Department of Instruction of the State
of New York.
Atherton and Bickmore rode to within
six miles of Pele's shrine, and then Ather
ton commenced his wonderful trip. He
actually climbed to within a few feet of
the top of the mountainâ the first man to
get that close to the fiery outlet. He was
surrounded by little jets of steam and the
rocks were so hot as to makfe it almost
impossible to stand on them.
Atherton obtained some splendid photo
graphs, some of which are now on their
way to San Francisco. His photographic
tripod was nearly burned in his effort
to obtain a good picture of the mouth of
the crater.
\V. A. Welbourne, one of the Miowera's
passengers, says that the volcano at
Mokuaweoweo continues to be very active.
For a few days it was impossible to get a
glimpse of Hilo, but on the night the ves
sel left the smoke cleared and a magnifi
cent view of the glow was to be had.
There was a grand display of fountains
from the crater. Vast columns of lava
could be seen thrown from the center of
the crater high into the air, to fall again
into the sides of the cone and rush madly
down Its sides in fiery streams. These
fountains vary from 200 to 500 feet In
height and are plainly visible thirty miles
away. Most of the natives anywhere near
the base of the mountain have moved ;
away, and there. is no immediate danger j
to any one In the neighborhood, although i
there is no telling when a second of the
mountains in the district will break out
again.
WIND AND LIGHTNING
DO GREAT DAMAGE
Electric Bolts Strike Numerous Chi
cago Buildings During a
Heavy Storm.
CHICAGO, Aug. 11.â A severe wind
and rain storm passed over Chicago
this evening, doing much damage. In
Central Music Hall many of the win
dows were blown out of the building
and scarcely an awning was left in any
part of the Masonic Temple The storm
was accompanied by terrific lightning,
which struck a number of places.
Guests at the Avenue House, Evan
ton, were seated at the dinner table
when lightning struck the electric light
wires which led Into the dining-room.
A combination gas and electric light
fixture was burned out and the current
played about the ceiling until it had
melted the fixture from its fastenings.
The gas escaped 'with full force and
burned furiously. The flames were ex
tinguished by the Fire Department.
The most disastrous work of the
storm was the destruction of the skele
ton of St. Joseph Polish Catholic
Church, at Southport and Bell avenues,
where the '_ wind wrought damage
amounting to $15,000. No lives were lost
in the collapse of the tons of steel
girders. ',;'
Late to-night it is reported that Stan
ley E. McGlew and a companion were
drowned during the storm. They were
sailing in a small boat oft Jackson
Park and It was capsized by the wind.
Several vessels in the harbor were
partly dismantled.
CLEVELAND STRIKERS

Injured.
CLEVELAND, Aug. 11. â Explosives
were again resorted to to-night on the

Case and Euclid avenues. The car was
bound east. There .were twenty-five
passengers on board, but no one was
injured. Several women tried to jump
from the car, but were restrained by
cooler heads. The car was so badly
smashed that it was necessary to send
for the wrecker.
The neighborhood is a very aristo
cratic one, on one corner being the res
idence of John D. Rockefeller and on

An aged Indian medicine man . named
Wahmooh has been missing for the past

he was immediately set upon by. two of
the band, who tried to kill him with In

Mrs. Ichtertz Must Answer for tha
Stealing of Wheat.
DIXON, Aug. 11.â The preliminary ex
amination of Mrs. Ida Ichtertz and Rob
ert J. Northrop, who were arrested at
Davisville last Monday and charged with,
having stolen forty-seven sacks of wheat
from the farm of James Millar, was held
here this morning before Justice Brown.
District Attorney F. R. Devlin conducted
the prosecution. The defendants, appear
ing without counsel, refused to . plead.
They were held to appear before the Su
perior Court under bonds of $1000 each.
Mrs. Ichtertz is the mother of .four
children and has been married twice.
She is of dissolute habits and her love
for strong drink was the cause of her
present dilemma. Her husband is a hard
working farmer and was at one time pos
sessed of considerable money. The wife's
derelict actions for several years have
caused his financial ruin and it has been
difficult for him to obtain a living for
himself and family.

OUT THE FILIPINOS
War Department Discussing the Advisa
bility of Declaring a Close Block
ade of Island Ports.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, WEL
LINGTON HOTEL. WASHINGTON,
Aug. 11.â a conference held by Sec
retary of War Knot with Acting Secre
tary Allen of the navy the advisability
of proclaiming a blockade at certain
Philippine ports was discussed.
The blockade to be established will be
stricter In character than that now en
forced, the purpose being to prevent
military supplies or assistance of any
kind reaching Aguinaldo during the
rainy season, and to keep his army as
unprepared as possible for a fall cam
paign.
The situation is complicated, accord
ing to official advices from General
Otis, by reason of the action of Aguin
aldo In interdicting intercourse be
tween the natives of seaports not under
the control of American forces and
ships of American register, and limiting
trade to vessels of foreign nationalities
other than the United States. This in
terdiction, according to General Otis'
dispatches, is in retaliation of his ac
tion in issuing licenses to persons in
Manila to continue trading in the
staple products of the islands. Military
officers with whom I talked say that at
the present time the native inhabitants
of Manila are dependent largely upon
their commercial and trading transac
tions for their livelihood, and they see
in Aguinaldo's decree an attempt to
stop trade between Manila and other
island ports in an endeavor to throw
the starving city upon General Otis'
hands.
While no apprehension is felt in mili
tary circles that Aguinaldo will be suc
cessful, if this is his intention, the au
thorities are very much exercised over
.the possibility of the inauguration of a
general smuggling of hemp and rice on
a scale similar to that which prevailed
during the Civil War in the Southern
States with respect to cotton.
Reports from Manila show that rice
and hemp have appreciated in value
300 per cent, and immense gain is to be
secured by successful smuggling. The
venture would undoubtedly tempt ad
venturers to obtain cargoes in ports
closed to inter-island traffic by order
of General Otis, and munitions of war
would be exchanged for native prod
ucts.
Rear Admiral Watson, according to
instructions given him by the Navy
Department, is co-operating with the
army to prevent the continuance of il
legal trading, and in a dispatch to the
Navy Department to-day he announced
that" on account of the necessity of
preventing such trading he would be
unable to send any of his ships north
as advised by Acting Secretary Allen.
I was told at the War Department this
afternoon that General Otis had not
asked for any further instructions
from Secretary Root, and until he does I
the latter [<_ disinclined to make any
suggestions. _, ....
All the little vessels under Admiral
Watson's command, including the Isla
de Cuba. Isla de Luzon and Don Juan '
"de Austria, will be placed in commis
sion as quickly as possible, and ar- j
rangements will be made for maintain-, j
ing a force before all the large ports
and patrolling smaller ones in order to
prevent illegal trading.
MAIL FOR VOLUNTEERS
SENT TO NAGASAKI
WASHINGTON. Aug. Interesting,
as evincing the Government's efforts to
push mail for the soldiers to the front
with all haste, is a communication re
ceived at the Postofflce Department from
San Francisco reporting on a telegraphic
order of July 27 to comply with a request
of Gem Otis to have mail for the First
Montana and First South Dakota regi
ments sent to Nagasaki for delivery.
This order was received there at 2 p. m.
The next dispatch of mails for Nagasaki
was from Vancouver, B. C, July 31, to
catch which the mail had to go forward
on a train leaving San Francisco at 7
o'clock five hours later. But a day or
two later the report says, the transport
Solace rived at San Francisco with
about sixty sick and disabled soldiers
from the First Montana and over thirty
from the First South Dakota. Their ros
ters were hastily sent for, but were not
ftnallv delivered to the superintendent
until "after 5 o'clock. Meanwhile all th?
mail for the men on the Solace had been
sorted by regiments and companies and
more than 400 letters due them held out
and sent to the Presidio fcr delivery. The
balance was forwarded on the 7 o'clock
train.
MACARTHUR DRIVING

REPORT OF THE BURNING
OF THE SATURNUS
WASHINGTON, Aug. ll.âThe Navy
Department late this afternoon re
ceived the following cable relating to
the burning of the Saturnus by the in
surgents, which was reported in the
press cables several days ago, and also
the shelling of San Fernando, reported
on Wednesday:
MANILA. Aug. ll.âThe Secretary of
the Navy: On August 2 the gunboat l'am
panga, commanded by Lieutenant Mc-
Namee, patrolling Lingayan Bay, Luzon
Island, found the American steamer Sa
turnus on the beach at San Fernando, the
insurgents having stolen the cargo. Naval
Cadet Woodward, in a dingy, fastened a
hawser around the rudder post of the
steamer under a musketry fire from
strong intrenchments of the steamer and
town. The Pampanga returned a hot lire,
but could not move the steamer. The in
surgents boarded the vessel. 1 have sent
the Yorktown to punish the piratical act.
On August 7 the Yorktown and the Con
cord and the gunboats Callao and Pam
panga entered the port of -San Fernando
and found the intrenchments encircling
the water front fully manned. Non
combatants were seen thronging the sub
stantial warehouses on the north side or
the town. The , vessels refrained from
firing in their direction. The first shell
from the Yorktown was answered with
out delay by field guns and musketry fire.
The vessel shelled the town forty-five
minutes. The extent of the damage can
not be ascertained. The Pampanga re
mained there. The Concord and Callao
are also patrolling Lingayan Bay, Luzon
Island. The Yorktown returned to Ma
nila. I have sent particulars by mail. The
climate of Manila is delightful now; ves
sels cannot be detached. All are needed
to prevent unauthorized trading.
WATSON.
ATKINSON SENDS OUT
ANOTHER CIRCULAR
WASHINGTON. Aug. Secretary
Hitchcock and other Government rials
m this city have received copies of the
circular signed by Edward Atkinson,
which the author says has been or will
be sent to th .â  commissioned and non-com- |
missioned officers of each returning regi
ment from the Philippines, together with
copies of pamphlets containing articles on
the Philippine situation from an anti-im
perialistic point Of view.
The circular, which is dated Boston. Au
gust 8, is headed "The Anti-Imperialist,"
and is addressed to the survivors of the
volunteer regiments returned from Ma
nila. Mr. Atkinson says that having been
informed that telegraphic messages from
the mothers and sisters of volunteers
from Nebraska urging them not to re-en
list have been refused delivery, he thought
he would test the question. He then iv
counts his efforts to send through the
mails to prominent officials in the Philip
pines the pamphlets refused by the Post
master at San Francisco some time ago,
for which the author of the circular --ays
he was "threatened with prosecution for
treason and sedition because of tin- ef
fort on my part to convey information to
you, citizens and soldiers, which would
inform you as to the work being done In
this country to stop what we believe to
be criminal aggression in the Philippine
Islands."
Mr. Atkinson adds that the three ar
ticles referred to, viz.: "The Cost of a;
National Crime," "The Hell of War and
It.- Penalties" and "Criminal Aggression;
By Whom Committed?" are included In
one of the two pamphlets sent to the of
ficers of the regiments, and lie asks their
views upon th.-m and upon the whole
course of the warfare in the Philippine
Islands, promising, if permitted to print
the letters, to make a careful selection
therefrom, "whether adverse to the po
sition I have taken or sustaining it."
CHEAP WATER RIGHTS.
Bonanza in the Grasp of San Joaquin
Farmers.
STOCKTON. Aug. 11.â Those farmers
who bought water rights of the original
owners of the Stanislaus and San Joaquin
Irrigation Company are said to be in an
excellent position to take in the system
for the inconsiderable amount of $30,000,
for which the property Is under condi
tional sale.
The valuable property was knocked
down two weeks ago for that amount
for the benefit of the bondholders, but
it is subject to redemption during the
legal period provided in such sales. It
is claimed that owners of water rights
are in the position of holders of second
mortgages, and as such will have first
call and be able to take in the property,
less many of the expenses which would
fall to an outside purchaser.
An effort is being made to organize
the farmers in order that they may take
up the opportunity offered, and it is more
than probable they could secure assist
ance from the local banks.
DISASTROUS STORM
IN CENTRAL STATES
Two Persons Killed by Lightning
and Many Others Seriously-
Injured.
CHICAGO, Aug. According to dis
patches received from points in Illinois,
Indiana, Michigan, lowa and Wisconsin,
a great deal of damage was done by last
night's storm. In some places there was
loss of life due to lightning, and the loss
of crops and destroyed buildings reaches
a heavy figure. Those killed are:
â â COLLINS, farm hand near Harvard,

In many places livestock was killed. A
large party gathered in a new, barn pre
paratory to dedicating it with a dance.
Lightning demolished the structure and
injured a number of those inside. An ice
house belonging to the Knickerbocker
Company of Chicago was burned by the
lightning at Elgin.
At Janesville, Wis., the house of C. L.
O'Brien was demolished by lightning.
All 'he members of the family were ab
sent at a picnic, and thus their lives
were saved.
At Bessemer. Mich., twenty-five dwell
ings were moved from their foundations
by the wind and flood. Corn and small
grain in stack was flattened out every
where, and the loss to farmers will foot

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, AUGUST 12, 1899.
SENSATIONAL TESTIMONY I S
EXPECTED IN DREYFUS CASE
Special Cable to The Call and the New Tork
Herald. Copyrighted, 1899, by James Gor
don Bennett.
PARIS, Aug. 11.â With the conclu
sion of the examination of the se
cret dossier to-day public sittings
of the Rennes court-martial will
be resumed. That to be held to-
I morrow is expected to be a sensational
one. It is announced that it will begin
with the examination of M. de la
Roche- Vernet, Secretary of the French
Embassy in Berlin, who will give evi
dence of a cipher dispatch regarding
Dreyfus from Major Panizzardi, Italian
military attache in Paris, to his Gov
ernmenta dispatch the interpretation
of which almost led to a conflict be
tween the French War Office and the
foreign Ministers.
The next witness will be M. Casimir-
Perier, who will be followed by General
Mercier. The latter's deposition, it is
expected, will be the crux of the whole
case. Anti-revisionists have pinned
their faith on this being a sledgeham
mer blow to Dreyfus.
According to reports current In Paris
General Mercier will divulge the means
by which the bordereau and other docu
ments were obtained from the German
Embassy. This agent is alleged to have
been Mmc 8., lady's maid to Countess
Marie yon Munster, daughter of the
Embassador, who was really a spy of
the French War Ministry. She sent
Count yon Munster's correspondence to
! the general staff, where it- was photo
graphed and then returned to the em
bassy.
About a fortnight ago, it is alleged,
an attempt was made to break into
Mme. B.s house, presumably in order
to seize her papers. A man was ar
rested, but proved to be a police agent,
who declared that he was acting on
the order of his superiors, and was re
leased.
M. Hennion. sub-chief of the Detec
tive Department, was called back from
Rennes to investigate the affair, but
nothing transpired as to the result of
his researches.
Both revisionists and anti-revision
ists accuse each other of inspiring the
attempted burglary, but the affair is
still the deepest mystery. Mme. B. is
said to.be now- abroad.
All this dramatic matter is rousing
public interest in General Mercier's
deposition to the highest pitch. Anti
revisionists have attached such impor
tance to it that the whole Dreyfus af
fair is now considered to turn upon it.
A rumor is current that General Mer
cier's statements will be in flagrant
contradiction to those of M. Casimir-
Perier and that if this be so, Mairre De
mange will demand the former War
Minister's arrest on the spot. In any
case, if General Mercier's deposition is
reached at to-morrow's sitting most
sensational developments may be ex
pected, i
The Matin will to-morrow print an
interview with Mme. Henry. When
speaking of her husband she was deeply
moved, and declared she was still con
vinced that her husband was a loyal
soldier. It was her intention to avenge
his memory by proclaiming ber confi
dence in the purity of his intentions,
and denouncing those who maintain
that he was a traitor. Mme. Henry
stated that she will persist in her action
against M. Joseph Reinach. Her depo
sition may be expected to cause deep
emotion among the public, which will
be due more, however, to sympathy
with her case than any positive evi
dence she can bring, as her conviction
of her husband's innocence seems
merely based on personal impression.

LONDON, Aug. ll.âThe Boer organ
in London, the Standard and Digger
News, to-day publishes a Johannesburg
dispatch, threatening Great Britain in
the event of war, and saying that the
Boers are determined to wreck the
mines and irretrievably ruin the gen
eral body of shareholders by blowing
up millions worth of machinery. It adds
that war will mean the absolute ruin '
of Johannesburg, both as a town and
as a mining center, and says:
"While It will doubtless end in a vic
tory for England, the price of that vic
tory will be the ruin of thousands, who
ought to consider the price they must
pay before authorizing the Government
to declare war." /*â *-.,
Another Johannesburg dispatch pre
dicts further concessions, and says:

but barely twenty persons had gathered
to witness his crossing.
The session opened at 6:30 with pre
cisely the same formalities as on Mon
day. Captain Dreyfus entered with the
same quick, jerky step. His features
were pale and* rigid. He took a seat
upon the platform and the reading to
the court of Dr. Ransom's report rela
tive to the finding of a document in the
lining of Dreyfus' waistcoat was then
begun.
The opening of the proceedings was
attended by a sensational Incident. On
Dreyfus being shdwn by Colonel
Jouaust the document found in the lin
ing ot his waistcoat by a penitentiary
officer he admitted keeping it as a
souvenir copy of the bordereau. He
owned to this calmly and without any
trembling of the voice.
Then he listened calmly to the read-
ing of Dr. Ransom's report by Major
Cassiere, the prosecutor, which occu
pied about ten minutes.
M. de la Roche-Vernet, one of the sec
retaries of the French Embassy at Ber
lin, was then called. He testified re
garding the translation of the Paniz

FORZINETTI THINKS
HENRY' THE CULPRIT
RENNES, France, Aug. ll.âThe Lon
don Times' statement this morning of
the late Lieutenant Colonel Henry's
treason caused considerable sensation
here, and was much discussed among
the newspaper men and all others in
terested in the trial. The affirmation of
Henry that Esterhazy was his accom
plice is only a confirmation of what has
already many times been stated. But
what was regarded as important .is the
fact that the Times announced it in
such categorical terms, demonstrating,
according to the views of the friends, of
Dreyfus here, that the Times' people
have actually had documents submitted
effort to avert intervention in the inter
nal affairs of the country."
KRUGER WILL ARREST

LONDON. Aug. 12.â The Cape Town

formers when the condition of affairs at
Johannesburg provides an excuse. The
presumption is that President Kruger ,

The correspondent here of the Asso
ciated Press spoke to Major Forzinetti,
who was Governor of the Cherche Midi
prison during Dreyfus' incarceration
there and who was cashiered on ac
count of his declarations favorable to
Dreyfus' attitude while in prison. For
zinetti said:
"The Times' statement confirms my
own view. I was convinced of Henry's
complicity from the very first and al
ways regarded him as the real culprit."
Regarding the court-martial he said:
"To-morrow will undoubtedly be the
most important day of the whole pro
ceedings, as General Mercier and M.
Casimir-Perier, formerly President of
France, if time admits will be confront
ed and a most dramatic scene is inev

matters differ on essential points."

CHICAGO, Aug. 12.â Eighty members of

He declares that he had permission, and
Captain ShafTner, the commanding officer,
held a contrary view.
It was decided to reprimand Thompson,
and he declared that he would not accept
â¢i censure and demanded a court-martial.
This was refused and the reprimand in
sisted upon. The entire ship's crew com
manded by Thompson sided with him and
threatened to leave camp if Shaffncr's or
ders were carried out. As a result eighty
men were placed in the guardhouse.

NEW YORK, Aug. ll.âThe Mazet ex

The session during the day was not pro
l ductive of sensational results. Superin
tendent W. A. Butler, who is in charge of
the city records, was called to the stand
for the purpose of showing, if possible,
that contracts for the city printing were

: excess on ducts, but said he had allowed
j it because the company had declared it
was necessary.
Mr. Moss attempted to show that this

; attorney of the committee insisted that
: the extra ducts amounted practically to
1 a franchise. This was denied by the Com

head against a table leg. The wound
I healed, but ever since William has been
having periodical nose bleeds, and sin
gularly enough, always on Wednesday.
: Then it was noticed that the slightest
pressure on the boy's body was enough
j to cause a slight hemorrhage under the
! skin. His body is covered with black
and blue marks where the blood has
j coagulated under the skin.
The physicians will try to cure Wil
liam by toning his system. They are
not sure that the wound on his fore

EXTENDED PLANS
FOR DECORATIONS
; Popular Donations of Palms
and Evergreens for Day
Display.
For.a few minutes yesterday, the mem
! bers of the decoration committee were
lon the" horns of a dilemma. Representa
j lives of the Pacific Incandescent Lamp ;
! Company, which has the contract for the
j erection" of the plant for electrical illu- ;
! mination during the reception of the Cal
: ifornia' volunteers, appeared before the,
! committee with the statement that the
i San Francisco Gas and Electric Company
! had refused to make the necessary con-
I nections unless the two-wire system in
j the original contract was changed to con
; form to its three-wire system. This would
I necessitate the purchase of 10.000 extra â 
i feet of copper' wire, costing $271 46. To
1 this would be added $403 26 for 2500 feet of
! weather-proof .-.ire and $885 for labor to
' connect the stringers with the mains, a
1 total of $1669 72. _ _ _Â.â,,
' The committee did not feel like incur
' ring the extra expense, and invited J. B.
i Crockett, president of the gas company, .
to confer with it. Superintendent Green
: appeared for Mr. Crockett, and' after con
i siderable discussion offered to cut the la-
I bor bill from 1885 to $600, and the bill for
J electric lighting for two nights from $Â«>_
jto $300. Mr. Green said he would also en
deavor to borrow the 2300 feet of weather
proof wire, which will effect a further
Saving of MO" _.. Added to this, the lamp

i perform. .With, these altered figures the

"TWO STANDARDS"
COMPARED BY A
HIGH DIGNITARY
Bishop Montgomery
at St. Paul's.
Right Rev. George Montgomery, Bishop
i of Los Angeles, lectured before a large
audience in St. Paul's Hall last evening
for the benefit of the building fund of
that well-known church. That a large
sum of money was added to the amount
already on hand was evidenced by the
number of persons who crowded the hall
to listen to the lecture.
The reverend father's subject was "The
Two Standards," and for over an hour
he held his auditors Intently interested.
The speaker handled his theme In a mas
terly manner, swaying his audience by
his flashes of humor, pathos and lofty
flights of oratory. Although. the subject
of his lecture was a deep one the Bishop
made It' so plain to his auditors that they
were able to appreciate his thoughts.
Throughout the lecture - the speaker's
sentences were punctuated with loud ap
plause.

: Chairman de Young of the finance
mittee addressed the decoration commit
tee on the subject of attaching small lan
tern* to the e.eetric lamps to bring out
' ne color effect more strongly. Th- com
: mittee took the matter under advisement
The committee asks for estimates
-to decorate both sides of Market
street along the curbs. The teie
; graph poles will be utilized and covered
with red, white and blue bunting and
'evergreens. Another plan is to stretch
' ten streamers, one in each block, from the
' ferry to the City Hall, raised above the
' electric light lines. These will be tied
! with evergreens on which will be suspend
;ed mottoes, battle scenes, pictures of
j prominent personages and words of wel-
I irma Martin appointed A. Schilling
: a committee of one to procure estimates
â¢ and such information as will enable the
! committee to formulate plans for this
; feature of the decorations.
M , Schilling desires that an appeal be
' made through the press for 2000 Christmas
! tree**" palm leaves and evergreens of all
1 kinds. Parents of the returning volun
â  teers who reside in the interior are espe
! daily requested to contribute- It is un
i derstood that the railroad companies will
; transport the follace free. Mr schilling,
' who requests also the co-operation of nor
; *sts and gardeners, has already received
: substantial proffers of assistance. .
In outlining the plan of day decoration
I Mr. Schilling said that where it was found
: impracticable to decorate the telegraph
! poles after the companies had given tne
i necessary permission, smaller poles would
;be placed at intervals along 'â¢" curbs ,in
; cement barrels tilled with earth and rocks.
; ..... decorated. It is Mr. Â» hilling s
! intention to make this feature Quite as
interesting as the night decoration.
i Chairman Martin appointed j? Charles
! Hlrsch to confer with th** Harbor Com
â  mi--9ioners regarding the decoration of the
' front of the ferry building. It is under
' stood that certain entrances to the build
: ing will be boarded to avoid draughts, and
''. it is intended to cover the boards with
I decorations. -_ _.
W X Hewitt, superintendent of the hre
' alarm and police telegraph, has volun
j teered to act as the committee's expert;
he will supervise the electrical construe-
I tion for the night exhibition.
The committee will meet again this
I morning at 11 o'clock in the Union Trust

THE PRESIDENT
TO BE INVITED
Veterans of Two Wars Will
March With Young
Heroes.
The invitation committee of the Native
Sons and Daughters is having prepared
specially engrossed Invitations to the re
ception of the California boys to be sent
to President McKinley, Governor Gage,
Mayor Phelan and to the mayors of other
cities in the State. Within forty-eight
hours invitations ornamented with a sou
venir design, including the bear flag and
the stars and stripes, will be sent to pub
lic officials, Federal, State and municipal,
and to all foreign consuls, to take part
in the parade.
An effort is being made to arrange na
tional divisions to be composed of so
cieties of the same nationality.
Owing to the fact that the parade is
to be a very long one and .It will be late
before it can be dismissed, a. committee
has been deputed to wait Upon the man
agers of the transportation companies to
I arrange for late trains and boats, so that
! persons living within fifty or sixty miles
of the city may have opportunity to re
turn to their homes after viewing the
most magnificent display ever planned In
San Francisco.
What will undoubtedly be one of the
I strongest features of the parade will bo
â¢ a division made up of Mexican war vete
rans and the California Volunteers of '61.
Colonel Wellington C. Burnett, Major Ed-
the church, introduced the distinguished
visitor to his audience, but judging by
the reception he received he was no
stranger In their midst. Father Connolly
said that It gave him great pleasure to
see the large gathering as it was an evi
dence of the Interest everyone was tak
ing in the work about to be commenced.
He alluded to the contemplated erection
of a new church and the remodeling of
the present building for use as a parish
school. He concluded by saying that his
pleasure was increased one thousand fold
1\ the audience's appreciation of Bishop
Montgomery.
Bishop Montgomery prefaced his lecture
by explaining what his subject was
about. He warned the audience that the
standards he was going to discuss were
not the -gold or silver standards, nor was
he going to speak on the fashion of stand
ard.. The speaker's opening sentences
were In a lighter vein and were highly
appreciated by the audience. The gist of
his lecture follows in part:
In the religious world there are two crite
rion** of Judgment or teachingâ judg
ment or human reason alone, and a divine au
thority, claimed to be established by God to
teach " religion. My assertion ls that looking
at the religious world at the present time,
private Judgment tends to undermine the
supernatural character of religion. It first be
gan by denying divine authority claimed by
the Catholic church. . It did so in declaring
that the Bible alone, interpreted by human
reason or private judgment, was a sufficient
and infallible guide. In the exercise of that
private Judgment on the Bible it has rejected
one by one as supernatural truths which it
formally held to be supernatural.
Originally, private Judgment claimed that
the whole of the Bible was a divinely Inspired
word of God. . It now claims that It cannot be
any longer held to be wholly the divinely in
j spired word of God; that it is made up very
largely of rubbish and legend and hidden tra
dition, and therefore, it cannot be taken as a
book divinely inspired, but there is a book
in which there is a divine' Inspiration. But
how shall we determine what is divinely In
spired and what Is rubbish, legend and tradi
tion? We must determine that in this way.
We must then revise the Bible and whatever
human reason approves we must claim to be

has been called to the fact that the So
ciety of California Volunteers of '61 is
still in existence with a membership of
thirty. Their annual reunion occurs every
April on the anniversary of the day that
General Sumner assumed command of the
Department of the Pacific. It is eminent
ly fitting that these grizzled California

RELATIVES PLAN
A BIG AFFAIR
Their Fund Rapidly Growing.
Employment Eureau to
Be Formed.
National Guard Hall, 815 Ellis street.
was crowded last evening at the regular
meeting of the association of parents and
relatives of the First California Volun
teers. Chairman C. [W. Moores called the
meeting to order and announced that
$1413 80 had been collected to date for the
breakfast fund.
A. C. Kohn moved the appointment of a !
committee consisting of representatives!
from each company of the National Guard j
of California to form the nucleus of an
employment bureau to see to It that all
returning soldiers may obtain positions.
This committee will co-operate with an
i other already appointed for a similar ob- I
divinely Inspired, and whatever human reason
rejects we must claim to be rubbish and tra-
Now, the question is: Whose reason shall
determine that or what reason . Is there a
court of human reason to which we may refci
this matter for decision? If that were true It
would be something at least, even if it were
a hidden tribunal, but as a matter of far'
there is no tribunal and the human reason
here spoken of is the human* reason of Aâ liâ <_.
It is the reason of the Christian, of the Jew,
the agnostic, of the out-and-out Infidel. No
man can say on this principle that the agnos
tic and the infidel has not Just the same right
to pronounce it either human or divine. Just as
well as the Christian has. In other words the
Christian will claim that the Bible is divinely
Inspired; the agnostic will say it is not. and
the infidel will claim that there is nothing
divine in it. Therefore, private Judgment or
the exercise of human reason has undermin -U
the supernatural character of religion.
Again, not many years ago. private judg
ment, exercised upon the Holy Bible, declared ,
there was an everlasting, eternal hell, and
that the Catholic doctrine of . purgatory was
a superstition. To-day private Judgment that
exists in religion has rejected the everlasting
hell and accepts the Catholic doctrine of purga
tory. Therefore, the principle of private judg
ment has in the last fifty or one hundred years
undermined and reacted numbers of - truths
that it held as supernatural and divine. IT
that principle continues, the time must come
when it will undermine the whole thing, and
if man wants supernatural religion he must
turn to the old church which teaches that di
vine authority.
Previous to the lecture the church or
chestra, composed of Miss A. Quinn. J.
Kennedy, Miss B. Thiol. Miss O. Thiel,-

(SIX COMPANIES
TO CONTRIBUTE
Chinese Merchants Eager to
Aid in Plans for the
Reception.
The spirit of patriotic enthusiasm which
has taken possession of Bat Francisco
since the announcement of the early re
turn of the California volunteers from the
Philippines and the preparations for their
reception has penetrated to the innermost
recesses i>f Chinatown. The Chinese citi
; zens of the city are desirous of showing
their appreciation of the valor of the gal
lant Californians.
Congressman Julius Kahn and Collector
of the Port John P. Jackson, representing
the executive council of the finance com- ,
mittee having charge of the work of rais
ing funds for the big reception, last night
visited the headquarters of the Chinese
Six Companies, at 728 Commercial street,
and extended a formal invitation to the
; merchants there represented to partici
pate in the forthcoming celebration and to
contribute financially and otherwise to its
success. The visit of the committee's rep

ORIGIN OF WARS.
Trifling Causes Often Bring on Con
. Franco-German War.
Many wars have had trifling causes.
A dispatch altered in one or two points
by Bismarck brought on the Franco-
German "conflict. Palmer-ton said fa - '
cetiously that only three men in Eu
rope ever knew what the Schleswig-
Holstein troubles, which led to two
wars, were about, and two of them
died before the conflicts began, while
he, the third man, had forgotten. A
slighting reference by Frederick the*
Great of Prussia to Madame Pompa
dour of France was said to have been
one of the causes of the seven years'
war, sometimes called the "war of the
three petticoats," from the fact that the
Fiance of Pompadour and the Russia
of Catherine II joined the Austria of
Maria Theresa against Frederick.
According to John* Bright, England
and her allies drifted into the Crimean
war without realizing it until after they
got In, and they did not know what
they were fighting for even after they
started,, while it is certain that every
thing which was supposed to have been
fixed by that conflict was disturbed
afterward. The results of the quarter
of a century of wars beginning with
the commencement of the French revo
lution . and ending with Waterloo
."pleased nobody and settled nothing,"
according, to Sheridan. The average
person who lived in those days knew as
little about the causes of the slaughter

quarter of a century. China is being

The Affair Has Caused Considerable
Excitement in Local Club Cir
cles, Where Martin Is
Well Known.
\
William H. Martin, the millionaire mine
owner and prominent local clubman, was
brutally beaten yesterday afternoon on
Post street, just above Grant avenue, by
two roughly dressed men whom he be
lieves to be hired thugs. After knocking
Mr. Martin down and kicking him about
the body i**. a brutal fashion, the two men
ran up Post street, making their escape
before the police arrived.
The aged mine owner was picked up in
a semi-conscious condition and assisted
into a -saloon, where stimulants were "riv
en him. His face was badly battered, -md
blood flowed freely from his nose. Mr.
Martin might have been beaten to death
by his assailants were it not for the in
terference of two gentlemen, who saw the
men assaulting Mr. Martin and rushed
to his assistance. When the thugs saw
the men approaching they took a parting
kick, at their prostrate victim and ran
away.
"I am positive that these men were
hired to assault me." said the mine own
er, while willing bands were washing the
blood from his face and applying lotions
to his bruised flesh. "I was on my way
to the Pacific Union Club when the men
accosted me. I don't remember ever hav
ing seen them fore, but I could identify
them easily if they were brought before
mo. One of the men stood in front of me
and the other struck me from behind.
Then they both rained blows on me and
knocked me own."
Much, excitement has been caused in
club circles over the affair, and friends of
the mine owner have been extremely
anxious to keep the details from the po
lio. Martin is a part owner in the famous
Rawhide mine, which has been instru
mental in the past in causing all sorts of
ill feeling and lawsuits among those in
terested in it. For some time a bitter
quarrel has been raging between Martin
and AY. A. Nevills. his partner, and when
Martin was attacked yesterday his club
friends believed that it was the climax of
the row with vills. The intimate
friends of the latter resent this Insinua
tion vehemently. They admit that for
some time past the two millionaires have
been on bad terms, but they declare that
under no circumstances would Nevills
stoop to hiring thugs to attack his ene
mies.
After the assault Martin was removed i
to his apartments at the Palace, and it I
is doubtful whether he will be able to
leave them for several days?. When a
Call reporter called at the Martin apart
ments last evening the old gentleman was
too ill to 1"- seen. His son express) re
gret that the affair had become public
and was unable to throw any light on the
subject.
"My father was brutally assaulted," he
said, 'and the matter is now' in the hands
of the police. His assailants were both
big strong men. and my father believes
from their appearai that they were
'dope" fiends. I know nothing about hi._
quarrel -with Mr. Nevills."
COLEMAN ON TRIAL
BY COURT-MARTIAL
THE WOULD-BE SUICIDE HAS
HIS FIRST HEARING.
Erring Ensign of the lowa Will Be â 
Called to Account for a High
Old Time.
The investigation by court-martial into
the charges against Ensign Coleman of
the lowa, who attempted suicide on
Wednesday night, was begun yesterday
morning at 10 o'clock on board the
cruiser Badger. Owing to Coleman's ex
tremely nervous condition little testimony
was taken and the court gave up its time
to the consideration of minor offenses.
Because of a rather warm time in which !
he indulged while the lowa was on the
dry dock at Port Orchard Coleman was
charged with conduct unbecoming an of- j
ficer. He had been guilty of similar in- 1
discretions before and a record as a rapid ,
liver made his case a particularly (lark
one against him. Either in a fit of
despondency or an attempt to gain sym- !
pathy he attempted suicide by shooting I
on Wednesday night. He was not Injured, I
but his act will result in an investigation '
as to his mental condition, and naval i
people said yesterday that this would
probably occur before his trial on the j
original charges is begun. Coleman was
taken on board the Badger yesterday in :
the lowa's launch. He was guarded by
a file of marines under command of a
sergeant and the party was accompanied
by Captain Terry and Lieutenant Hughes. ,
The officers decline to say when the in- j
vestigation will be resumed.
WRECKED A RESTAURANT.
Two Soldiers Clean Out a Grant- j
Avenue Chophouse.
John Campbell, a soldier, charged with
battery and disturbing the peace, failed â¢
to appear when his name was called in
Judge Mogan's court yesterday, and a '
bench warrant was issued, for his arrest.
He was found last evening at the Pre
sidio by Policemen Colen and Nelson and
locked up in the City Prison.
On Thursday morning Campbell and an- j
other soldier who has not yet been ar
rested visited a restaurant kept by ,
Nicholas Constantene at 432 Grant av
enue. They called for sandwiches, and I
as they did not show a disposition to pay
for them the proprietor ordered them out
of the place. According to his story, they
then started to wreck the restaurant, con
cluding with smashing him over the head
with a huge ham. Fearing that they In
tended to kill him. the proprietor ran from
his place of business and notified Police
men Colen and Nelson. They arrived in
time to arrest Campbell, but his com- 1
panion had flown. It is expected that he
will be arrested to-day.
Slate Writing Necromancy.
Professor Henry, the conjurer, says that
the supernatural powers slate writing nec-
romancers claim to possess is but the art
of a magician, and that on Sunday at
Glen Park he will prove this fact to his
audience. Professor Henry is billed to ex
pose fortune tellers who reveal secrets of
the future by means of slate writing.
In the free theater the following bill will
also be presented on Sunday: A flying
trapeze performance, by St. Clair; De Jal

RED MEN JOURNEY HERE TO HOLD
THEIR SUPREME LODGE SESSION
PROMINENT MEMBERS OF THE INDEPENDENT ORDER.
TO-MORROW there will arrive the
representatives to the Supreme
Lodge of the Independent Order of
Red Men, which is to hold its ses
sion in the Turn Vereln Hall, on Turk
street.
This order of Red Men. one of the
oldest American.- organizations in the
fraternal line, was instituted in Penn
sylvania in 1812, but it did not make
much progress until is:,4. when it was
extended into Maryland, and a number
of subordinate organizations were in
stituted. In 1850 the German element
withdrew from the order and estab
lished what has since been known as
the "Unabhanglger Odern der Roth
manner," or Independent Order of the
Red Men, and Instead of tribe to des
ignate the subordinate bodies, the
name lodge was adopted.
In California the order is represented
by fifteen lodges, under the jurisdiction
of a grand lodge, the officers of which
are: R. Landmann, grand chief; C. N.
Neubourg, under chief; F. Breomer,
vice chief; Charles Kuss, chaplain; B.
S. Sammann, secretary: Joseph Gut
beriet, treasurer; H. Schreiber. mar
shal: C. Drief. r, herald; J. Friske,
guide; J. Klefer, inner guard; H. Beck,

pelled to work to support her three chil
dren. The oldest is a boy IS years of age
and the youngest a girl of 9 years.
VALLEY ROAD AFFAIRS.
! Work on the New Ferryboat Moving
But Slowly Toward Completion.
Owing to the delay In receiving material
from the East the Union Iron Works is
not making very satisfactory progress on
the construction of the new ferry boat for
the Valley Road Company. As Mr. Storey
I graphically describes the situation, "The
; Union Iron Works have made a boiler
tube and in the days to come they will
build a boat around it. The lack of ma
terial is due to the congestion of orders
in the Eastern factories, which have more
contracts on their hands than they can
well attend to. However, this state of af
fairs is not expected to last so long that
the passengers over the Valley Road will
be unable to come from Point Richmond
to San Francisco in the new craft some
time next year." . ââ.
U The n vessel" : when completed will be 230
feet long with accommodations for over ,
â  six hundred passengers. In the mean-.
time the traffic will be taken care of by
thâ¢ Ocean Wave, the vessel which the
Sad brought down from the north for
[hat purpose and which Is now being
overhauled and ted for the slips at Hay
& Wright's shin yard at Alameda Point.
Plans 8 are now 'under consideration for
remodeling Hatnaway's warehouse the
corner of Harrison and Spear streets so
as to make it useful for a freight depot.
Tracks will be run Into it so that the
I cars can be taken directly from the boat
fnto the depot, where they will unload
IheTr merchandise. When finished this
: freight house will be the only two-storied
structure of Its kind on the coast.
The magnificent passenger station at
Fresno upon which so much money and
labor has been expended, is now tearing

end of the second week in October win

Carpenter of getting a newspaper to

Letters That Tell of the Havoc
Caused by One Man in
Less Than a Year's
Time.
*
If the recent reports from Guatemala
are correct, the people of that much
troubled state are having a very exciting
time. Yesterday letters and telegrams
were received here which tell of a finan
cial panic that has sent the exchange on
American gold up to the enormous pre
mium of 750. This premium is not so
much brought about by the superior ex
cellence of the coin of the United States
as it is attributable to the difficulty that
the average citizen has to ho|fi on to
money of any sort under the rapacious
government of President Cabrera. The
entire country is in a state of financial
uneasiness, which is in a great measure
to be attributed to the recent sale of the
Northern Railroad by Cabrera and his
right bower. Morales Tomar. to a New
York syndicate.
It is the law of the country that before
any such sale shall take place the con
sent of the Congress of Guatemala must
be first obtained. Cabrera sold the prop
erty without taking Congress into the
matter in any way. Now he is asking
that body to ratify the transaction and
promising a speedy death to any member
of that august body who dares to say
him nay. From the reputation that the
President has established for a cheerful
willingness to carry out his word to the
letter in all such matters there is but
little doubt that the Congressmen will be
brought to take his view and ratify the
sale. Further disquietude has been occa
sioned by tin- report that has gone abroad
that the New York syndicate will consider
the property attached to the road as
United States property and only subject
to the laws of this country.
This railroad comes within sixty miles
of connecting with the one owned by C.
P Huntington, which runs from San Jose
to Guatemala City; but the country is so
rough that it Is estimated that it will
cost not less than $10,000,000 to close up
the gap. At present the situation in the
Central American state is not such as to
warrant any such investment of capital
In that part of the world.
One of the letters received makes men
tion of the fact that though Cabrera has
not yet been a year in the President's
chair he has succeeded in making a rec
ord for bloodthlrstiness that, has never
before been equaled by any of his prede-
The following is a partial list of those

over fifty others who have been shot at
various laces all over the state. Every
one of the victims were men of promi
nence and leaders in the commercial, po
litical and social life of the state. Not
one of them died in battle. They were all
executed at the personal orders of the
President and but few- of them enjoyed
even the semblance of a trial.
Tho country is in a state of genera
panic and the most prominent people are
getting out of the jurisdiction of Cabrera
and to places of safety as fast as they
can. The dictator realizes the detestation
in which he is held and employs a large
fore,- of police for his personal protection.
These men are. well paid and they are
the only ones In the employ of the Gov

their wages. The Guatemalan legation

To judge from the tone of the letters
Guatemala is not a good place for
a man to move to with the idea of bring

were brought back and temporarily lodged
!in the City Prison. To-day an effort will

A HARBOR FOR
ALVISO NOW AN
ASSURED FACT
Work of Dredging to
Begin at Once.

RAT ATE HIS WAXED MUSTACHE
WHILE HE SLEPT.
Â«
Captain Taylor of the American Ship
Kenilworth Will Educate His
Children While at Sea-
Notes.
Alviso harbor is to be deepened until
vessels drawing seven feet can enter it
at low water. The Government has the
matter in hand and in a few weeks the
contract for the dredging will be let. The
bids for this work were very far apart,
the lowest being Edward V. McCann,
$12,402, and the highest the Dundon Bridge
and Construction Company, $39,893. The
next lowest to the McCann bid was that
of Marshall Harris, who offered to do the
work for a little over $26,000.
The secret of the groat discrepancies in
the i.ids is found in the fact that McCann
intends using the Jordan rotary dredger
f and excavator. With this he claims he
1 can move fifteen cubic yards of earth a
; minute, while the dredgers at present
in use can only remove one cubic yard of
earth a minute.
The Government, when calling for the
I bids, specified that any kind of dredger
' might be used, and McCann'S opinion.
! which is backed by the American Surety
: Company, is that with the Jordan patent
he can "do the work at 6 cents a cubic
yard and make a profit, while the other
bidders figured that in order to make it
; pay they would require from 13 to 19 cents
; a colli.- yard. . -<â¢
With seven feet of water in Alviso har
| bor large sternwheel steamers could come
! and go at all hours of the day. This would
j give a water competition to San Jose,
which would mean a great deal for San
[ta Clara County. It would mean a re
| duction of train rates for both passen
gers and freight and that would be ' a
I saving of thousands of dollars monthly
j to the community. All the bids for the
| deepening of the harbor are now in the
i hands of Major Heuer and he will for
ward them to Washington at once.
The schooners Muriel and H. D. Ben
-1 dixen finished a very close and exciting
race yesterday. They left here in com
i pany on July 29 and both were in Puget
: Sound yesterday morning. They must
have raced in company all the way up the
coast and passed in through the Straits
of San Juan de Fuca within an hour or so
of each other. Captains Carlson and Ol
sen had a bet of $luO on the race, but they
will have to do some figuring to find out
i which has won. The telegrams to the
Merchants' Exchange states that the Mu
riel was at Port Blakeley while the H. D.
; Ben dixen was close by in Salmon Bay.
The many friends of Captain Fraser of
the British ship Queen Margaret are won
* dering why he wears his mustache
clipped close these days. The captain
says in explanation that it was a case of
necessity. He went to a reception at
Charles Turner's home the other evening
and before doing so had his mustache
; carefully waxed at a downtown barber's.
After the reception it was too late to re
turn to his ship so the captain put up for
the. night at a hotel. During the early
hours of the morning Captain Fraser
awoke. Something alive was sitting on
j his face and seemed to be paying partic-
I ular attention to his mustache. A sud
, den move on the part of . the skipper
j scared a big rat and as it made for its
I hole Captain Fraser followed. The rat got
j away and Fraser proceeded to view him
; self in the looking-glass. One end of the
1 well waxed mustache was gone and in
start had been made on the other. If
beredictions would kill that rat ought to
have died within the next five minutes.

GAS COMPANY ASKS
FOR MORE MONEY
AMOUNT FIXED IN THE LEVY
NOT ENOUGH.
Perrault and Colonel Sullivan In
dulge in a Lively Political
Tilt.
President J. B. Crockett of the gas com
bine, C. O. G. Miller, secretary of the San
Francisco Gas Improvement Company,
and Attorney Rix appeared before the
Finance Committee of the Board of Su
pervisors yesterday afternoon to plead for
an increase in the gas appropriation fixed
,by the board in the tax levy. The esti
â  mated gas bill for the coming year is $36,
--> 000; the amount appropriated is $30,000.
Mr. Crockett said it was not the extra
â  $6000 he was asking for, but he did object
to the city using $36,000 worth of gas and
then paring down the bills. If the city
Intended to allow only $30,000, he said, he
wanted the Supervisors to make out a list
of the lights they wanted turned out in
order that only that amount of gas might
i be consumed.
Chairman Perrault called in Colonel Sul
! livan to discuss the matter with him. The
colonel announced that the Mayor would
I have been present, but that be was out
| driving with ex-Mayor Strong of New
York. Chairman Perrault asked Colonel!
Sullivan if the Mayor would consent to
lan increase in the gas fund. He said the i
I board had adopted the Mayor's .suggestion
! in fixing the amount, and did not care to !
raise It without his consent. Colonel Sul- ;
livan denied that the Mayor had anything
to do with it. and attempted to unload
all responsibility for the levy upon the '
board. The colonel waxed personal in his
remarks, and a lively tilt between him and
Perrault ensued. The committee finally
requested Mr. Crockett to appear before
the- whole board in open meeting on Mon
day next, when the Mayor would be pres
ent and could give advice upon the propo
sition.

GREAT GERMAN OPERA
COMING NEXT SEASON
GADSKI.SEMBRICH, RESZKE AND
OTHER STARS TO APPEAR.
Eames, Brema. Dipple and the New
York Symphony With Paur or
Damrosch Billed.
When the friends of C. W. Strine. the
clever Philadelphia impresario, discov
ered that he had arrived as a member of
the Pennsylvania reception committee
they immediately knew that he had other
plans than those of a patriot. Soon these
suppositions were verified, for It is now
known that he is making arrangements
for a German opera season to take place
at the end of next March or the beginning
of April. . . , ___
Mr. Strine speaks very highly of ban
Francisco as a musical town, especially
regarding grand opera. He proposes to
have a three weeks' season, during which
fifteen performances are to be given.
TheÂ«e are to include the following operas:
â¢â¢Walkure." â¢'Siegfried." -'Goetterdam
merung," "Tristan and Isolde. Melsler-
Binger* "Tannhauser," "Lohengrin,
"Fidelio.'. "Magic Flute" and "Les No-
C Among theÂ°arilsts are to be: Mme. Gad
ski Marcella Sembrich. Schumann-
Hi'nck Mary Brema, Mattfeld. Olitzka.
The tenor will be Dipple, whose Lohen
grin was such a tremendous success at
Bavreuth; barytones-Edouard de Reszke
and Bisbom; basses-Stehmann and Emil
Fischer. The New York Symphony or
chestra which was here with Melba. is
to be re-engaged and either Emil Paur or
Walter Damrosch will conduct. Inas
much as San Francisco has for some time
! been anxiously waiting for German opera
ths season will no doubt prove a great
success Of course there will be consid
erable expense connected with the trans-
I portion P and support of such a combina
i tion but for this, too, Mr. btrine nas
found a remedy. He will get up a sub
scription list among the many subscrib-
I ers of the Melba season who were so lib

reriorts he has all reason to believe that

'' an artistic standpoint the season will be

THE WORLD AGAINST HIM.
W. C. Deffren, Out of Money and
Employment, Turned on the
Gas and Died.
W C Deffren, aged 50 years, committed
suicide last Thursday night by turning
on the gas in his room at 215 Seventh
street. He had stopped up all the crev
lees in the door and window with bits
I of paper and cloth, in order that the gas
' might not escape. Deffren had been out
i of work for a long time and owed two
1 months' room rent. He fretted over his
penniless condition and had been very
despondent for a week. ;
The body was found yesterday morning
by Mrs. Briggart. his landlady, and was
taken to the Morgue.

THE GOLD COMES ROLLING IN.
rROM the auction sale of seats for the benefit to
be given by the dramatic stars of the city a
goodly addition has been made to the volun
teers' reception fund, which is now approaching the
$20,000 mark. Assurances are given of aid from other
sources that will add another noble sum to the fund.
Half of the $50,000 asked for by the reception com
mittee is therefore virtually in sight. For the re
maining half let the people respond. There are cer
tainly 25.000 men and women in San Francisco who
will take pleasure in contributing an average of a
dollar each for the purpose of r welcoming the boys
home and assisting them to obtain employment.
Whatever is to be given should be given promptly.
There is no time to lose. The transport bearing the
volunteers is well on her way across the sea and will
be here within a time comparatively short. The en
tire sum asked for should be in the hands of the com
mittee before the close of the coming week. Under
such circumstances to delay in giving will be almost
as had as not to give at all. The emergency calls for
promptness as well as for liberality. He gives twice
who gives quickly, says the old proverb, and never
was. that ancient wisdom more applicable than at this
time.
It is to be borne in mind the money is not to be
expended wholly in parades and festivals. It is the
intention of the committee to assist the boys in find
ing employment after they are mustered out, and a
considerable portion of the fund will also be required
to provide a fitting welcome for other troops on their
turn from the war. A moment's consideration will
show that the sum asked for is none too large for
the purpose in view. It is certainly none too large for
a city of the wealth and population of San Francisco.
Every citizen is expected to contribute to the fund.
The boys are coming. The time is short. Let the
response of the people be prompt.
By reason of the fact that the dollar limit has
crowded Mrs. Grace Harris out of the Morgue, the
duties she .performed will devolve on Coroner Hill's
male deputies. Space-writers on the daily papers will
bless the fortune that dowered them with such a
type-consumer as Mr. Matron Tom Smith-McCor
mick-Sullivan- Flanagan- Gately- Mogan - Lacombe-
Wolfe.
MUSIC AND PATRIOTISM.
UNDER any circumstances the famous Arion
' Society of New York would be welcome to
San Francisco. We are a music-loving peo
ple, a social, hospitable, genial people, and all who
come to us in the goodfellowship of music find a cor
dial welcome. The Arions, however, have promised
to provide an entertainment for the benefit of the
volunteers' reception fund, and in that way have
doubled their welcome. They are with us in the
sympathies of patriotism as well as of music, and
their songs will awaken a responsive chorus even
from those to whom nature has denied the gift of
melody.
The Arions of San Francisco, with their allied Ger
man vereins and singing clubs, could be relied upon
to fitly welcome and entertain their fellow Arions ;
from the East, but that pleasant duty will not be left I
wholly to them. By their ready agreement to join
with us in the popular preparations for the recep
tion of our volunteers the visitors have made them
selves the guests of the whole city. San Francisco
welcomes them in patriotism as well as in harmony.
While they stay with us our city is theirs, and if,
being smaller than their own town of Greater New
York, it should not furnish enough to fill all their
vast capacities for joy, they may take the State. All j
California is theirs.
The officious lieutenant commander of the Brit
ish gunboat Peacock may find that it is more dan
gerous to talk about Uncle Sam's soldiers than it was

SWINE OND SALVATION.
SEVERAL years ago there append -.3a n '!
Francisco a wonder worker named Dowie.
He hailed from far' New Zealand, and his busi- j
- ness in life was prolonging it by "Christian healing."
He professed to cure all the inherited and acquired
ills of the flesh and bones by a persuasive incanta
tion which induced the sick to think that they were
well. "As a man thinketh, so is he." was interpreted |
j by Dowie to mean that if sick Smith think himself â 
1 well Jones, so is he. \
His career here was more or less checkeredâ prin- |
I cipally more. As a prophylactic prophet he found an j
j implacable rival in the healing climate of California,
I and finally pulled in his sign and made tracks for i
other fields. These pastures new he found in Chicago. j
I There he has an "institute," with a capacity for five
I hundred people, and it is full all the time, for verily
one of that kind is born into the world every minute. ;
j When his signs and passes failed to repair a rebel- !
I lious liver or remove the remorse of a guilty stomach
he came to putting the blame of failure on a pork :
I diet, and posted on the walls of his mystery mill. '
above the legend, "God Bless Our Home," a tablet
inscribed, "Whosoever eateth of swine flesh or
raiseth hogs is not fit to enter the kingdom of
heaven." Dowie therefore decided to attack the hog
j in his stronghold, for the Berkshire, Poland China,
Suffolk and Chester White root in every square mile ,
of Illinois and the neighboring States, and in that
I city doth not Phil Armour stick ten thousand pigs a ;
I day and turn into money everything from bowels to :
bristles, except the squeal? To attack the hog and
! the processes for his conversion into food and fer
tilizer, hair brushes, bone buttons and sausage cases :
is to pull the foundation from under Chicago and send
j a misery through several States. When the ears of j
j corn heard of Dowie's campaign they grew cross
! grained. The sentiment of those prairie States was !
uttered one time by Hon. Frank Landers of Indiana,
who packed pork, went to Congress, ran for Gov
ernor and bought the Hoosier hog crop. His pack
ciy in Indianapolis was redolent of odors not of
Arab}-. The people revolted and called a big meet
ing in English's opera-house to denounce Landers
and all his works. Orators took the stage and held
up to pity and. protection their noses, disheartened by
breathing the pork-scented air and discolored by the
use of disinfectant remedies. It was a torrid time, but
i some one said fair play was a jewel which shone even
in a sow's ear, and Mr. Landers should be heard.
I That stalwart slaughterer appeared and said: "What
[settled Indianny? Corn and hogs. What built every
j house in this State? Corn and hogs. Whar'd the
j money come from to put up this opry-house. and !
paint them picters of Mr. Shakespeare, Mr. Johnson
i and others of our celebrated countrymen? From
corn and hogs. What eddicated Governor Hendricks
and made Dan Voorhies an orator, and bought Ben
I Harrison's linen breeches an' a coupee to ride from
i Delaware street to his law office? Corn and hogs. !
When I think of what would become of Indianny
! without corn and hogs I think a Hoosier that cair.t
j stand the smell of slarterin pigs ought to be drummed
across the line into Kaintucky to eat blue grass an'
go into the dairy."
That settled it. The crowd voted with effusion
i that the Landers porkhouse was an ornament to the
city.
In the midst of such a community Mr. Dowie has [
\ unfurled the black flag, skull, crossbones and all,
against the hog as a stumbling-block to salvation. :
1 He has sent out evangelists to preach this crusade
right into the heart of the hog region. â  Two of these,
Mr. Groves, until a year ago a Methodist evangelist, !
and Mr. Holmes, formerly a Methodist elder, selected j
as their field the town of Worthington, Minn.,!
where stood the embattled hog. rooting by the road- !
side. They converted the leading hog breeder, Mr. |
Milton, in whose white clover pasture hundreds of
j hogs were passing their novitiate for the corn finish
' which would fit them to matriculate in Phil Armour'-*
institute in the early winter. Milton was made to j
I feel that these grunters were a team pulling him right j
i straight into that fiery furnace and burning lake de
scribed by his namesake John. He agreed to save j '
j his own bacon by sacrificing that of his hogs, and !
after preparing a wide and deep grave and a tomb- !
j stone inscribed, "Whosoever doth not bear his cross!
i and come after me cannot be my disciple; this !
' monument erected over swine flesh killed for Jesus' j â 
; sake," he and his sons got their Winchesters, the !
: evangelists supplied the prayer and cartridges and the
signal for the first volley, which they said came by
.divine inspiration, and the shooting began, nor j
stopped until every porker had rooted the dust.
The scene had attracted a large number of neigh- j
boring farmers, and when the funeral began they
I threatened to lynch Milton, the evangelists and all j
I concerned.
Â°
The affair closed by taking Milton before a court
to test his sanity, and notice to the evangelists to root
out of there. This they did after delivering two pray
, ers in the hogpen.
The probable propagation of a fanaticism is shown
by the genuine alarm of the Chicago pork packers
lest this fad spread and materially reduce the hog
crop, and it has already had a bad effect on the price
of corn.

BRITISH POLICY IN THE TRANSVAAL.
ONE advantage to the public of the British sys
tem of government by a Ministry responsible
to Parliament is that it enables the opposition j
party to demand an explanation of the policy of the j
Government' upon any issue before the country, and
thus furnish the people with a fair understanding of j
what the Ministers purpose to do. In accord with
this privilege Mr. T. P. O'Connor has asked Joseph
Chamberlain, Secretary of the Colonies, what course
the Salisbury Government has decided upon in deal
ing with the Transvaal, and the' reply has made it '
clear that if the crisis in South Africa pass away with
out a war it will be due more to the diplomacy and '
the courage of the Boers than to any moderation on j
the part of the British. j
Mr. Chamberlain is quoted as saying in the course I
of his reply: "We recognize the grievances of the :
Uitlanders and have said that these grievances are not
merely themselves a serious cause for interposition
I but are a source of danger to the whole of South :
| Africa. We say our predominance is menaced by the
action of the Transvaal in refusing to redress the
grievances or give consideration to requests hitherto
put in the most moderate language of a suzerain
power. We say that this state of things cannot be
tolerated. We have put our hands to the plow and
won't draw back. With that statement I propose tc
rest content."
From that statement it appears the object of the j
British Ministry is not so much to redress the alleged :
wrongs complained of by the Uitlanders as to assert i
THE SAN FBANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, AUGUST 12, 1899.
j British supremacy throughout South Africa and
; suzerainty over the Transvaal. A concession of the
SrJrjvilegqs' demanded by the Uitlandtrs would not,
therefore, end the claims made upon the Boers. The
! British demand of them the virtual surrender of self
government. Their republic is to cease to be inde
pendent and to pass formally under the protectorate
I of Great Britain.
The claim of suzerainty on the part of the British
i is not a new one, and at one time was to some extent
I conceded by the Boers, who did not then foresee
i what would result. They now perceive that from
I suzerainty to sovereignty will be but a short step, and
' that if the right of the British Government to inter
| fere in the local affairs of the Transvaal for the pur
i pose of redressing complaints made by Uitlanders
: against the republic be conceded, it will not be very
; long before there will be no great difference between
! the condition of the Transvaal and that of Egypt.
The Salisbury Government does not expect these
| claims to be conceded willingly. . The dispatch of
j troops to South Africa goes briskly on. From Mr.
' Chamberlain's statement that the issues are "a source
j of danger to the whole of South Africa" it appears
the Ministry fears a general uprising under the lead
of the Boers which would involve even Cape Colony
itself. It is in that light, at any rate, he presents th_
issue to Parliament, to the British public and to the
world. It is essentially a frank statement that Great
Britain is fighting for empire in Africa and the Boers
must surrender their independence or maintain it
against all the power the British can bring against
them.
The whistle should be blown on candidates for the
office of Labor Commissioner, each of whom is con
stantly violating the eight-hour law in an effort to
induce the Governor to appoint him to the place.
GOVERNOR ALTGELD has recently made
his contribution to the Chinese music now
being furnished by the "new Democracy."
The great test of this year is to be made in Ken
] tucky, it seems, not as to the future of the Republi
'â  can party, but as to the grip of the Bryan faction on
the opposition. Altgeld declares that Goebel. the
Democratic candidate for Governor in that State,
"will be ground to powder." This trituration is to
; occur to Goebel because of his "intimacy with the
enemies of Mr. Bryan's friends."
Nothing is said of the ill-starred Goebel's un
soundness on silver, nor of his lack of admiration of
! the crazy quilt pattern of the Chicago platform. But
jhe is merely convivial with the enemies of Mr. j
Bryan's friends. By this the public is left to assume j
that the Blue Grasser says "howdy" to men in the j
party who think there are other pebbles on the poli- j
tical beach besides the orator of the Platte and other |
rivers. It is, therefore, a declaration of war against
all men who are not for Bryan's nomination. They
may be sound on the unsound platform, and may be- â 
lieve wholly in the sacred ratio of 16 to i. They may
desire destruction of the Supreme Court and wish to i
remove all judicial safeguards to the rights of prop- â¢
â  ertv. But it they are not foresworn to Bryan they j
are to be ground to powder. The Goebelites, when
they heard their doom announced from Chicago, im
mediately flung to the breeze a banner inscribed in j
water colors, "Bryan and Blackburn." But this did j
not seem to secure their acceptance, for Altgeld im
mediately repeated his declaration of war and alluded
to the banner and its legend as "a conspiracy."
He also said that he did not believe that Colonel i
Bryan would support Colonel Goebel. But therein :
he slipped a cog, for when Bryan heard that his name
was on a banner in Kentucky he issued dates for a
stumping tour there in support of Goebel. The Gov
ernor in his first interview went further than to lay j
Goebel low, and gave out a platform for the party, to
be affirmed next year. Some of his declarations on
that subject are remarkable. He favors holding the
Philippines and giving them "a good form of gov
ernment," and seeing that no other power interferes j
with them. But he opposes any increase in the army
as imperialism! Just how the conquest which must
precede any form of government in those islands i;
to be made without an increase in the army is not |
explained. One can see the folly of advocating a i
policy which, in the opinion of the best military
judges, will require a present force of 100,000 soldiers
and permanent garrison of not less than 50,000, and
at the same time denying the use of that military es
tablishment without which the policy itself is un
thinkable. Imperialists will see nothing noxious in
Altgeld's proposed plank. The Republicans, if they |
shall elect to follow imperial standards, will find it \
difficult to do better for that issue than their oppo- j
nents.
The further planks proposed by the Sucker Dic
tator are for Government ownership of everything
that engages the physical and business energies of
the people. He says: "Let the Government take the i
railroads, and all monopolies will begin to totter and ,
some of them will fall." He omits explanation of the
methods by which property that has cost the owners i
eleven billions of dollars is to be taken. But, judging 'â 
from his known views that whenever a piece of prop- j
erty becomes profitable to its owner it ceases to be- j
long to him, we suppose that a knock will be heard
on the office-door of every railroad, and the Govern- ;
ment will walk in and take a seat, with a full equip- j
ment of conductors, brakemen, engineers and sleep- !
ing-car porters, and immediately take charge. To j
advocate such a scheme as this and oppose imperial- j
ism is to run away from a fugacious kissing bug into
the carnivorous jaws of a Bengal tiger. Imperialism I
is a condition in which government dominates the
people. It comes of the possession of power to dic
tate their fate and subordinate their will. Pray what
difference does it make whether this is done by the !
employment of an army of 150.000 men, or the em- I
ployment of a force of five millions who depend for j
their daily bread on- Government favor and bounty I
and wages, in the gainful occupations of which the !
Government is the owner?
The standard complaint of men like Altgeld
against the large corporate and individual employers I
of labor has been that they control the votes and I
dictate the political action of their men.
When Altgeld unsheaths his spiteful tongue against I
Goebel, because he is friendly to . Democrats who
oppose Bryan's nomination, what may we expect of I
an Altgeld in the Presidency who controls several '\
millions of workingmen, that eat their bread in the I
shelter of Government ownership?
More than one path leads to imperialism, but the j
i shortest trail is Government ownership.
We may get rid of an oppressive standing army,
for it does not often approach the polls, and in any j
event can be outvoted when its support becomes !
oppressive. But what chance will there be against
any Government, no matter how bad, once it is in
power and through Government communism con
trols so many millions of votes?
United States naval authorities have just finished a
new chart of the world. It is not so very long ago j
since the same authorities assisted very materially in j
1 making a new- map of the earth. j

MINGLING DIVERGENT MANKIND.
Can the Contact ol Two Races
in the Philippines Result
Beneficially to Either?
11,
EDITOR of The Callâ Sir: The sec
ond lesson our people have received
but not apparently learned is in our
experience with the negro popula
tion of the United States. They
were originally imported as slaves and
the result of this early expansionist en
terprise was the mingling of the white
race with the black. It produced even
more disastrous results than the mingling
of the white and red. Intelligent people
long ago comprehended that the greatest
evil resulting from slavery was not mere
ly in the existence of occasional cruelty
toward the enslaved race by masters of
extreme brutality. It was realized that
the worst effects were not immediately
apparent and were comprised in the grad
ual debasement of the more civilized mas
ters and the prevention or obstruction of
true civilization among the slaves. The
white man fell and the negro could not
rise.
It is now apparent, since the termina
tion of our Civil "War, that slavery was
only an incidental evil and that its sup
pression at the cost of so many lives did
not remove the source of a dangerous
and annoying condition which necessarily
arises from the mingling in the Southern
States of two divergent varieties of hu
man beings to whom intermarriage is re
pugnant. After the Civil War the Re
publican party with enthusiastic devotion
to the complete freedom of the negro en
deavored to secure and maintain for him
entire Bccial and political liberty. The
result almost produced a new rebellion
and It gradually became apparent that,
like oil and water, the two races could
not unite In any particular. It cou.d not
be a Government by the whites and
blacks. It must be social and political
control by either one or the other. The
more intelligent and powerful race has
naturally become supreme and the ne
groes are actually serfs In the Southern
States, though nominally freemen.
Opposition to this condition and denun
ciation of it have nearly ceased in the
North, for it is beginning to be under
stood that unless we can remove the an
tipathy which exists between the whites
and the blacks there must always be cer
tain evil results from contact between
them. Many of those evils are recorded
in the history of negro slavery In the
United States. The existence of the white
and the black together in the South de
veloped a race of aristocratic masters
ruling a race of ignorant slaves who must
be kept In ignorance tq insure their con
tinuous servility. .It developed the inev
itable mongrel as a frequent product,
whose servile existence under such condi
tions becomes a torture exquisite in pro
portion to his resemblance to the domi
nant race, it produced the "poor white
trash," a social factor whose status was
even worse than that of the slaves. The
charactenof a nation being merely a com
posite picture embodying the character
istics of its Individuals, slavery was de
basing the United States, for every ne
gro born within its borders made the na
tion worse and weaker.
The evil effects of white and black con
tact culminated finally In the Civil War,
in which every soldier who died on either
side paid the penalty for the sins and folly
of our ancestors, who were blinded to
future results by their own greed for what
they supposed to be immediate advan
tage The introduction of negroes tor
mented the nation with sectional animosi
ties for fifty years. It stagnated the in
dustrial life of the Soutnern States so
that they are still far behind any. other
part of the country in the development of
their resources and in all kinds of social
efficiency It held in miserable subjection
not alone the blacks of the primitive Afri
can type but also thousands of wretched
creatures of mongrel types In whom the
mingling of Caucasian blood had devel
oped aspirations which made slavery to
them a hell on earth. Its evil effects
spread from the slave-holding sections
into the national life till it cursed the na
tion with accumulated wrong and the war
of the rebellion came as a purifying fire
to warn us of these crimes against na
ture. We paid dearly In the- blood of
North and South for the sins of our pro
genitors.
And we are not done yet making pay
ment. Some millions of negroes still re
main among us in political and social sub
jection. The Inevitable mongrel is being
bred into a world in which he finds him
self neither white nor black, and where he
is sure of mental torture in proportion to
the intelligence which he may possess.
Every time a white man is murdered or a
woman outraged by brutal negroes in the
South every time a Southern mob horri
fies the world by torturing and burning a
negro, we pay again for the mistakes of our
predecessors and register another protest
against the mingling of different races.
Bitter antagonism still exists between the
two races in the South, a condition of
suppressed warfare Is manifested, and the
evils are not likely to be abated except by
the separation of the two races, or by the
disappearance of the antipathy which pre
vents amalgamation.
A third, lesson of experience is com
prised In the immigration of the Chinese
to the Pacific Coast. At first Chinese
immigration was popular; their cheap
labor was welcomed by all, just as
slavery was at one time satisfactory to
North as well as South. Then we dis
covered, first In the West and later In the
East, that their presence here would be a
I curse to the American people, and they
were barred out by stringent laws against
j their immigration. And why would they
; prove to be a curse?
Not particularly because they are im
: moral, for in certain forms of morality,
i notably in their industrious habits and
I their temperate use of intoxicants, the
Chinese are superior to the whites. Not
particularly because they were supplant
ing the labor of our own people by sub
stituting cheaper labor, for European Im
! migrants had been doing that for a cen
tury. The real reason at the basis of ail
opposition to Chinese immigration is the
fact that they are a divergent variety, it
i not yet a distinct species, of human be
; ings," with whom we instinctively refuse
; to intermarry, although, alas for human
i frailty. the antipathy is not sufflciently
j general to prevent the occasional appear-
I ance of the Inevitable mongrel.
Had the Chinese been of our own race
: their appearance in America would not
â  have been more objectionable than the
! immigration of millions of Europeans,
1 who come here willing at first to work
; for lower wages than our population, and
I satisfied at first with a lower standard
of living. Had the Chinese been Cau
casians they would have soon adopted
our customs and ideas, changed their
standard of living as Europeans have
done, demanded and received better
wages, and thus ceased to be the rat
like competitors of whom we have justly
complained. In the absence of racial dis
tinctions their union by intermarriage
with our people would have permitted
their children to become absorbed ac
ceptably Into the great composite associa
tion termed the American people and
there would have been no "Chinese ques
tion. "
As it was, however, the inevitable war
of races had already commenced on the
Pacific Coast in the boycotts and riots
when immigration was fortunately re
stricted. The condition proved that race
wars. belong not alone to the South, but
, occur whenever two antagonistic races
are brought together. The people of the
North were never more moral than those
I of the South. They were merely fortunate
in escaping contact with a divergent race.
The people of the Bast, who at one time
â  blamed the Western people for antago
] nism to the Chinese, were no better than
we are or were. They merely did not.
and perhaps do not now. comprehend the
entire significance of race contact. Our
people escaped the final calamities of as
sociation with the Chinese, but they ex
perienced enough to understand that a
mixture of the white with the yellow race
would result quite as disastrous to both
as contact between, the white and the
black. It remains now to consider con
tact with the brown race. _

Central League Republicans Meet for an
Ail-Around Hand-Shake,
Fine Display of Political Strategy by Gavin
McNab â Phelanites Are Alarmed at the
Mention of Louis Sloss Jr. as a
Candidate for Mayor.
DISTRICT committeemen of the
Central Republican League as
sembled at headquarters in the
Grand Hotel last evening. for a
handshake. The district losers
as well as the winners were invited to
the meeting. Men who lost after mak
ing a gallant fight were congratulated
on their energy and loyalty. The win
ners were praised for the success
Â«ehievt_d, and all were happy. It was
the sense "( the assembled members
that the delegates acknowledging alle
giance to the league should be called to
gether as soon as they receive from the
Registrar their certificates of election.
The sentiment in favor of an early
convention is gaining strength. There
is apprehension that the old bosses may
attempt to unite the delegates who
were not elected by the league Indorse
ment. The number of such delegates ap
proximate one hundred, and in the
hands of a leader of skill and dexterity
might be converted into a dangerous
wedge. Good reasons are, therefore.
submitted for an early meeting erf the
majority to discuss plans for directing
the affairs of the convention before em
barrassing agreements can be made in
the interest .*f candidates aspiring for
nation. There was some talk yes
terday of bringing forward Henry J.
Crocker for Mayor. The name of Phil
Lillienthal of the Anglo-Californian
Hank was also mentioned. When the
name of Louis Sloss Jr. was suggest*
the â  telanites were so alarmed that
one of the Mayor's subsidized evening
papers published the following:
During the past few da. there have
been many rumors that certain Republi
cans had been asked to run for the office
now held by Mr. Phelan and thai they
had declined". The leaders of the "Cen
trals," as they are now called, say that
it any one has been asked it has been
solely upon the asker's own responsibility.
No person or committee has been dele
gated to seek out a candidate. Neverthe
less, some Republicans have been ap
proached on this subject. Louis'*' gloss Jr.
is one of these. A zeal Republican
visited him an i asked him to "get Into the
fight." saying in the presence of Mr. Sloss'
father, "We want you because you are
the only man who could beat Phelan."
"Why should we want to beat Mr.
Phelai asked Mr. Sloss the elder. "He
has made a good Mayor. We do not want
to beat him.
No such interview as the foregoing j
represents has taken place during the â¢
compaign. Louis Sloss Jr. is now in
Alaska, and has not been in San
Francisco since he left here for the j
north three months ago. Should Louis j
Sloss Jr. enter the contest as the i
standard bearer of the Republicans;
Mayor .Phelan would know before the
votes were counted that there had j
been a campaign.
One year ago it was almost the uni- j
versal talk that Maguire, the Little !
Giant, who had never known defeat, !
could not be conquered, Defeat was not |
all that Maguire suffered. He was be- [
trayed in the homes of his political
friends. It frequently happens that the
"invincible candidate who is nomi- j
nated before his convention assembles
loses the election.
Gavin McNab, the leader of the Dem- I
ocracy, is now about to display a stroke j
of political genius that will provoke the â¢
Examiner's wrath and rage. He has !
decided to convene the executive com- .
mittee of the Committee of One Hun- j
dred next Tuesday evening. Following
his directions, the committee will issue â 
a call for an early convention. The I
present programme provides that Jas- j
per McDonald shall be chairman of the
nominating convention, but in this re- !
spect the slate may be changed. The j
assembled delegates will not proceed at J
once ro nominate candidates for office. I

Mr. McNab has more important work
than that in hand. He will . have a
county committee chosen to govern the
party before Buckley, Rainey and the
Examiner can get in their work on dis
appointed aspirants. Gavin McNab is
fully apprised of the Examiner's special
anxiety to gain control of the Demo
cratic reins and will adjust the ques
tions of future management at t. 3 out
set. There will be a legion of "turned
down" candidates before the convention
winds up. Mr. McNab will see to it that
the opportunity shall not be given to
them to get revenge by kicking against
a county committee programme. The
committee is to be selected before nomi
nations are made. A programme in the
hands of a master may be changed to
meet exigencies, hence Gavin McNab
may relax if the convention shows signs
of extreme resentment. But he did not
relax at Sacramento a year ago. when
Major Harney was reviled by Mayor
Phelan and when a large body of Dem
ocrats was excluded from the State
convention. Mr. McNab is firm in one
position. He is determined that the offi
cial organization of the party under his
leadership shall not be used by the Ex
aminer to give Hearst a trading dele
gation in the Democratic national con
vention. Every one going to the Mills
building for political Inspiration comes
away clearly convinced on that point.

He Knew How to Take It.
Here is a story which Is vouched for by
a local Standard Oil official. It concerns
a certain superintendent who ,'was sent up
to the company's works at Whiting to
oversee matters. One morning as he was
strolling about with his eves open he dis
covered an Irisnman laying pipe in the
customary excavation. The superintend
ent is a very irascible man. In addition
to thin, he has a wonderful command of
sulphurous language. Something about
the man's work displeased him. and he
suddenly opened up. or. rather down, on
the poor fellow with all his heaviest ma
teria!. But though he condemned him to
perdition in a dozen different ways, the
man in the ditch never so much as looked
up. If he had been deaf and dumb he
couldn't have taken his roasting more
stolidly. The superintendent stfddenly
pulled up In his wild tirade.
"See here, my man." he roared, "don't
you know I'm giving you hell?" â¢
The pipe-layer paused. Slightly turning
his head, he squinted up at the superin
tendent.
"An' ain't I takin' it like a little mon?"
he quietly asked.â Cleveland Plain Dealer.

LEAPT TO HER DEATH
FROM A FIRE-ESCAPE
MISS MARY McKENNA.
lf\\Jr\ a demented woman
II )( \ about "'â  years of age,
li Jn_ \j> took a horrible plunge to
death from the fourth
story of St. Mary's Hospital last
evening. As in most cases of its
kind, the aged woman's body was
not mangled, and she lived for
nearly an hour after she had
struck the ground. A broken leg
and possibly a fracture of the
backbone were all the external in
juries received In the fall. Noth
ing interrupted the descent of the
ROMAN EXCAVATIONS.
' Result of the Recent Work Done in
the Forum.
When the Pelloux Ministry was
formed at the end of June, and Signor
Bacelli became Minister of Public In
struction, it was assumed by the arche
ologlsts that something would be done
to push forward the work of excava
tion and arrangement of the classical
remains in the Forum museum, and
that the well-known enthusiasm of
Signor Bacelli for all that belongs to
the history of Rome would be suffi
j cient to overcome the objections cer
tain to be raised on the score of ex
[ pense.
I remember walking around the Pala
j tine hill one hot morning in July and
hearing the speculations of the guard
ians and the ciceroni as to what could
be done if Signor Bacelli had his way,
had enough money at his disposal and
remained long enough in office to carry
through his plans.
Signor Bacelli did not disappoint ex
â  pectations, but a great proportion of
the credit for the discoveries lately
: made is due to Signor Boni, a Venetian
engineer and architect, who is animated
by a passion for archeology in general
i and the Forum in particular The
means at his disposal were small, being
only 5000 lire (less than Â£200), and when
it is seen what Signor Bon! has done
; for that amount, in conjunction with
the fact that the gilt letters placed on
the Pantheon during Signor Bacelli's
last term of office cost Â£300, it will be
admitted that on the present occasion
' Italy has obtained good results at a
cheap price and with an absence of
Jobbery.
First, below the floor of the temple
of Vesta four brick walls were discov
ered (probably built in the time of Ha
drian), which form a kind of chamber.
Searchers for marble in the sixteenth
century may have spoiled one of the
walls. The chamber is supposed to
have served as a depository for the
ashes of the sacred lire, which were
taken from the temple once a year.
No discoveries, properly so called,
were made on this site, which stands
at the northwest of the house of the
Vestals, but the inscribed frieze and
the capitals and bases of columns and
pilasters were replaced in their orig
inal positions.
In the neighborhood of this monu
ment the really important discoveries
began. In front of the temple was a
wall built of tufa. Between that wall
and the hemicycle of the front wall of j
the temple was found the core of the i
base of the honorary column which,
after Caesar's murder, was set up I
parentipatriae. This column was built
of the marble known as giallo antlco.
The core of the base is made of con
crete formed with chips of giallo antico
and of gray Carrara marble. The fact
of this base being in concrete seems to
show, according to some archeological
authorities, that the fragments now
found must be a reconstruction and not
the original one, as concrete was not
used at the time of Julius Caesar.
Several fragments of the recon
structed Temple of Julius Caesar have
been found in a retaining wall, which
forms a kind of embankment to that
side of the Forum. They seem to have
been built into the wall indiscriminate
ly, as were also several pieces of the
Basilica Emilia. One of these frag
ments, nearly a cubic yard in size, is
very finely decorated with a bull's skull
or boucranion. The wall or embank
ment in which these blocks have been
found must be made up in great part
of simlarly interesting remains, but ex
cavations have had to be suspended on
acccount of a protest lodged with the
Government by the dwellers In the
wretched little houses which stand on
the brow of the embankment itself."
The only way out of the difficulty would
be to have money enough to expropriate
these tumble-down buildings and re
move them. Here is a chance for
wealthy archeologists to intervene, buy
the wretched hovels and make a present
of them to the archeological authori
ties. ' :--;V

Miss McKenna was brought to 9
the hospital from the San Fran- J
Cisco Sanitarium by P. J. Gegan, a 9
carpenter at 5 Bowie avenue, I
Thursday afternoon. The physi- Â©
clans who were in charge inquired I
if she were demented, but they Â©
were assured by Gegan that she I
was not, and only needed a little â¢
rest and treatment for melancho- I
lia. Thursday night the physi- 9
cians observed that she acted pecu- â¢
liarly and paced the floor. They â¢
decided to let her remain for an- !
other day to ascertain whether or 9
not insanity was her ailment. '
Last night about 5 o'clock Mrs. 9
Sweeney, another inmate of the 1
ward in which Miss McKenna had â¢
been placed, noticed the latter '
climb out of the window and bend y
over the tire escape at the fourth _
story. She called for her to come y
in, but noting that no attention i
was paid to her request shouted y
for one of tile attendants. Before ~
help could arrive the unfortunate y
woman had deliberately swung '
herself clear of the iron framework 9
and into space. Mrs. Corcoran and I
Mrs. Davidson were also in the eg)
room when the terrible act was i
committed. The body of Miss Mc- A
Kenna was picked up, and when y
life was found not to be extinct I
every effort was made to relieve her 9
sufferings. In spite of all medical |
skill, the hapless woman passed 0
away at 6:30. Deputies La Combe j
and Flanigan were _ummoned from A
the Coroner's office and conveyed y
the body to the Morgue. Miss Mc- _
Kenna was a native of Ireland, and 9
is said to have formerly resided at I
1212 Larkin street. She had no (_}
known relatives In this city. j
Miss McKenna owned property gj
at Stevenson and Seventh streets y
and had $31.00 deposited in a local '
bank. 9

I The pavement Itself was protected by
I a curb of travertino, or ordinary Ro
man stone, and in the fourth or fifth
' century a marble fence was erected
around the curb, which evidently im-
I plies that some tradition of sanctity
I hung about the spot. As the use of
I black marble for such purposes is most
unusual there can scarcely be any
doubt that this black stone is what
'â  was called in the old days "The Tomb
of Romulus." The origin of the stone
,is still uncertain. In order to settle the
question as to its geological classifica
tion Signor Boni has had one fragment
â  polished â a process which has rendered
:it perfectly evident that the stone is
I marble. Whether it came from Greece
I or from the Pyrenees is uncertain, but
j in many chateaux in Savoy 1 remem-
I ber having seen chimney pieces made of
marble from a quarry in the Savoy
Alps of precisely similar black marble,
with veins arranged in exactly the same
way, except that they were yellow in
color instead of being white like the
i veins of the "Niger Lapis." Explora
tions are being carefully made under
the Niger Lapis in the Forum, and Sig
-1 nor Boni is convinced that construc
tions of some kind exist beneath it.
What they are is not yet certain, but
we shall know before long. Quite close
to .the Niger Lapis have been found
j numerous medieval wells, which are be
ing pumped out. These wells are lined
; with fragments of marble, much of it
; ninth century work, probably taken
from the original Church of Sergio and
! Bacco. These wells show how short
the supply of water must have been in
i medieval Rome. The Tiber was putrid,
j the aqueducts had been cut and wells
; were sunk close to the Cloaca Maxima,
the main sewer of Rome.
During the operations in the Forum a
road which bounded the north side of
the Forum has been held bare. This
I road was known to exist, but had never
been exposed. Signor Boni is inclined
|to think that it is the original Via
i Sacra, and that its discovery will neces
i sitate Important modifications in the
topography of the Forum.
In addition to these important discov-
I cries much work has been done. The
i basement of the Temple of Saturn has
! been strengthened with iron bars, which
. were much needed. One of the fourth
' century honorary columns has been set
, up again, and another one will soon be
j erected. The opening into the Cloaca
i Maxima has very wisely been closed.
j The entrance to the Forum has been
f changed, and in future visitors will no
longer descend over the platform of
j the Temple of Castor and Pollux, as
has been their path for many years,
but will go down by a new staircase
on to the Vicus Tuscusâ that street
where the Etruscan merchants had
their shops and sold incense, looking
glasses and dainties, wrapping up their
waresâ according to Horace â with tlr.
verses of the minor poets. The Church
of Saints Cosmas and Damian, orig
inally the Temple of Romulus, will be
redeemed, restored to its original form
and probably used as a small museum.
Excavations are still in progress and
further discoveries are anticipated. â

Sailor Who Jumped Overboard and

Been the Culprit.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
VICTORIA, B. C, Aug. 11.â News has
reached here from Sydney, at which
port it was reported by the Currie liner
Argus of the theft of a box of gold from
the steamer Koningin Regenteâ a rob
bery similar to that which occurred on
the steamer Alameda.
The steamer arrived at Batavia on
the 4th of last month from Holland via
the Suez, and at once reported that a
box containing Â£4000 in gold for the
Java Bank had been stolen. The box
with the gold was put on board at
Southampton and was deposited in the
strong room, the key of which is in the
custody of the captain and kept in a
chest. Whether this key was taken out
i of the chest or whether a false key
was used remains doubtful. The rob
bery was so well carried out that it
was not discovered until just after the
steamer had left Genoa. The investiga
tion that followed brought little more
i to light than suspicions against some of
the crew. A search for the money on
the supposition that it was hidden on
board proved fruitless.
A few days afterward the solution of
the mystery seemed near at hand. In
the Suez Canal one of the crew had let
himself down into the water at night
and was never seen again. News came
shortly afterward that he had been
drowned. No. long afterward two sol
diers belonging to a military detach
ment jumped overboard. They were
pursued, captured and brought back.
Naturally these attempts to escape
j were brought into connection with the
1 robbery. It was inferred that the
drowned sailor was the robber. On the
surmise that he had taken the treasure
box also, so that it had disappeared
with him in the water the canal was
dragged but nothing was found.
On the arrival of the steamer at Bata
via notice of the robbery was given.
i Some Europeans belonging to the crew
were suspected of having had a hand
in it. The Public Prosecutor and the
police conducted an investigation on
board. Nothing further was known at
the date the mail left Batavia by the
steamer for Sydney.

As It Swept Over a Big City Like

sultry Sunday afternoon' in June I
was standing in front of the Kan
sas City Central Police Station chat
ting with the late Thomas M. Speers,
then, and for many years, Chief of Police
of the Western Missouri metropolis. We
were grumbling at the intolerable heat
j and the Chief who had been a frontiers
| man in his youth; was assuring all comers
| that "Death's Valley" and the hottest
, holes in the sunken desert of the far West
could not beat it. Suddenly a mysterious
gloom came down over the cityâ a creepy
i feeling at the roots of the hair. For an
! Instant the sultry calm became more on
pressive than ever, and to breathe seemed
to require an effort. Then little vagrant
currents of air darted hither and yon ap
parently with no definite purpose Or des

shortly rested on a yellowish cloud that

serving it its progress seemed slow, but
a little calculation afterward showed that
it had crossed the entire breadth of the
city in a very few minutes.
"Looks like a California waterspout,"
said Speersâ "No. it's an old twister, and
there's bell in it."
A moment later mounted policemen were
galloping up to report a cyclone, tele
phone calls for ambulances, patrol wagons
and help were pouring in. Are alarms were
summoning the department for work
among the wreckage and crowds were
hurrying to the scene of destruction. The
tornado had crossed the city in almost
as straight a line as if its trail had been
surveyed and staked out for it in ad
vance. For almost the entire distance Its
track was between Fourteenth and
Fifteenth streets, and hardly a house in
the two or three miles of Its spin across
the city escaped damage. On the hilltops
it made complete wreckage of everything
in its path: in the depressions there was
mucn It ss damage, as it seemed to lump
from hill to hill. Brick structures suffered
most: some of them, notably one or two
churches, -being reduced almost to powder.
| Marvelous as it may seem, there were not
I more than seven or eight persons killed,
and perhaps five times as many more or
less seriously hurt. The damage to prop
erty amounted to hundreds of thousands
of dollars.
Before the great cloud of dust raised by
the terrific besom's work had cleared
away, the sun was shining, the atmos
phere was calm and deliriously cool and
nature smiled as innocently as if tragedy

Trials of a Press Agent.

EYE DISEASE
Cured by Dr. Aborn After Resisting
Ordinary Treatment for Nine
Years.
The remarkable success of Dr. Aborn.
554 Sutter street, in the treatment of dis-
eases of the eye, ear, head, throat and
lungs attracted wide attention In this city
thirty years ago. One of these cases came
under the observation of a reporter yes-
terday. It was that of T. Sullivan of 9
Geary street, who was cured of a chronic
disease of the eye of nine years' standing.
Mr. Sullivan says:
SAX FRANCISCO. Aug. S. 1599.
This is to certify that Dr. Aborn cured me of
a painful disease of my eyes thirty years ago.
and they have remained permanently well ever
since. I suffered for nine years prior to treat-
ing with Dr. Aborn and had been treated by
several well-known : physicians. I was also
treated at the Eye Infirmary In New York with-
out even temporary relief. Dr. Aborn cured
me permanently In two weeks' time. I would
recommend all who are afflicted with any dis-
ease of the eyes to apply to him. I give this
testimonial voluntarily out of gratitude to Dr.
Aborn. I can be seen any day at my place of
business, 9 Geary street, second floor, room 23.

A CLAMBAKE
TO TEMPT THE
CORINTHIANS
San Franciscos Plan Another
Race From Vallejo.
Amended Challenge for the Perpetual
Cup Has Been Accepted by
Tiburon Yachtsmen.
Having abandoned the cruise to Belmont
Slough to meet the South Bay yachtsmen,
the Corinthians sailed up to McNears
Landing last Saturday, about eight or ten
boats following the flagship, On Sunday
the fleet cruised to Point Pinole, and came
down to Tiburon under a reef. The prac- ;
tice of reeling is becoming more general
on the bay than heretofore, it having been
found that a boat makes better weather
In a tiff breeze when its sail area Is some
what reduced.
To-day is an open date, and to-morrow
the annual clambake will be given at the
clubhouse at Tiburon, under the manage
ment of Port Captain John 11. Keefe.
Next Saturday, tne 19th inst., the summer
cruise up the Sacramento River begins.
Commodore Carl Westerfeld Will be joined
by three or four yachts, the owners of
which have arranged to take their sum
mer vacations together.
At a meeting of the directors of the San
Francisco Yacht Club held on Monday it
was decided to amend the challenge pre**
viouslv sent to the Corinthians for the
perpetual challenge cup. The challenging
boat is Matthew Turner's -'.adder, which
lias a beam of -â â¢â â¢ feet, a water-line length
of 24.^1 feet and a sail area the square
root of which is 26.50 feet, thus giving a
sailing length of 25.50 feet.. On Wednesday
Secreiarv i. L. Miner, after a special
meeting "of the Corinthian directors, held
to discuss the matter, prepared a letter
of accept Ihe measurement of the
challenging boat is not quite exact, as sev
eral alterations will be made to tit her for
the contest but the Corinthians accepted
25 50 feet as the Gadder's minimum sailing |
length. The challenger is a boat of very
light draught, and it is not unlikely that
an iron keel ma> be put on her and her
sail plan enlarged. As the defending yacht
must i, d be more than 10 per cent larger
than tile challenger, the limit of the
Corinthian boat is a racing length of 28.05
feet The sloop Aeolus, the racing length
of which is Lit.'. 1 feet. is accordingly un- i
available as a defender, as her owners
would be unwilling to alter the sail plan
or water-line length of a boat in such
excellent trim. J. W. Few's Truant, the
racing length of which is 29.24 feet. also
exceeds the limit. W. J. Humphrey's
sloop Mignon (25.94 feet) is nearer, but Is
still a little too large. The Phoenicia, for
merly owned by R. R. l'Hommedieu and S.
Â«' Delamater, has a racing length of 22.3-1 i
feet, and though she never displayed great j
speed on this bay she had a most success- j
ful racing career in New York and Yoko- j
bama. P. W. Hurndall's sloop Merope
.22.70 feet) is the boat most available at
present as a defender, but nothing has
â¢ been definitely- settled .is yet. According
to the deed of gift not less than thirty nor
more than sixty lays after the date of the
challenge the nice must take place, the
da. being not later than September MO.
A committee from each club will settle
the details, and has power to postpone
the race for not more than two weeks
from the date lirst fixed. No time is set
within which, the defender must be nom
inated, and so far as the conditions of the
deed of gift show the nomination might
be mad.- on the morning of the race. Ow
ing to the Infrequency of regattas on the |
bay not many chances occur of testing I
the merits of the yachts under varying .
conditions of wind and tide, so it is quit" :
likolv thai the Corinthians will have a
trvoilt of the possible defenders at the
regatta of the Pacific Interclub Yacht
Association on September 9. The yacht
selected will be placed at the disposal of i
ho club, which will bear all the expense
of altering the boat and putting her into
trim.
The S._n Francisco yachtsmen also aban
doned the south bay cruise last Sunday,
and several of them sailed in the upper
bay Among these were J. R. Savory's,
sloop Juanita, Commodore T. L. Hill's
sloop Cygnus and A. Sutherland's sloop
Catherine: The sloop Will-o'-the-Wisp
anchored off Marin Islands. A. Suther
land cut himself badly in the leg with a
knife, and had to be brought ashore for |
treatment; he has recovered. - -- *
The San Francisco Yacht Club has a I
hop at the clubhouse on its programme I
for the 19th inst.. but as it has been de- I
cided to substitute for the annua! regatta â¢
en the 20th a race from Vallejo to Sau-
ilito, it will l" necessary for the fleet to
make Man Island next Saturday night.
. As on the occasion if the successful trial
of speed from Mare Island to the club
house on May 21. each boat will receive
a time allowance based on its racing
length. John D. Spreckeis' schooner Lur
line will be. the scratch boat and will start j
last.
McConnell TO meet
franey, THE boxer
The Meeting of the Popular We ter-
Weights Is Expected to Result
in Good Sport.
Frank McConnell and Jim Franey will

"Doc" Flynn and "Jack" Kane and
"Jack" Funis aid "Jack"* McMahon will
box ten rounds each.
Franey mad many friends in his dash
ing fight with Charlie Goff, who proved
to,, big and too strong for him, however.
Franey was aggressive to the bitter end,
a class of boxing which is always admired
by the ring-goers of this city.
McConnell should be cherry ripe for the
bout, as he has been in training for some
Tim.-. lie was ready to enter the ring with
Al Neill some weeks since, when tin- lat
ter was Injured and the bout was declared
off. Since then he has taken only suf
ficient exercise to keep on edge.
Hiram B. Cook will act as referee.
Herman Oelrichs. th.- well-known patron
of boxing, has informed John A Ham
mersmith, leader of the Olympic Club,
thai he will offer four more belts next
year for amateur championship bouts in
the various .lasses.
Al Neill is still confined to his home by
the sprained ankle he sustained at Vallejo
while boxing with Tom Sharkey.
The friends of Cocker Tweedie. the
clever Australian boxer, have arranged a
benefit for him. It will be given at the
Observatory Athletic Club, on Telegraph
Hill, on the 22d inst. A big programme
is being arranged. Young Mitchell will
act as referee. â 
CANNOT SELL VENISON
UNDER PENALTY OF LAW
There is a law on the statute books
which makes it a misdemeanor for any
one to sell de. meat. Paul Wlchrowski,
proprietor of. the Occidental restaurant,
on Bush street, learned of this law yes
terday when he was arrested by c. a. Vo
gelsang and John Davis, deputies Fish
and Came Commissioners. The two went
to the place for their luncheon, when their
attention was attracted by seeing on the
bill of fare the special announcement that
"venison saute" was among the luxuries
of the house. Two plates of the article
were ordered. The bill was paid and the
sale of the goods was complete.
When the warrant for toe arrest was
served upon the restaurant keeper he was
willing to have it that the venison, was
raised upon the wilds of Telegraph Hill,
where it had fattened on tin cans and old
shoes. Upon being questioned as to where
he procured the deer meat he stated that
several days ago Supervisors Black and
Phelps had been shooting in Marin County
and that a part of the gam.- had been sent
to the Occidental restaurant to be cooked
for the benefit of several of the officials'
friends. After the official feast the Su
pervisors told him he could have what
was left. These "scraps" Wlchrowski had
converted into a stew which he -aye the
aristocratic French name of "saute." This
was what his patrons had been devouring
under the impression that they were In
dulging in a luxury.
- Elaborate preparations are being mado
for a horse show in Denver on the last
two days of September in conjunction
with the Mountain and Plain Festival.

CAUGHT A TROUT EACH
MINUTE FOR AN HOUR
C G. Young's Remarkable Experience
on the Garcia River, Mendo
cino County.
C. G. Young has returned from a fishing '
trip to Garcia River, Mendocino County,
with a remarkable story as to the excel- j
lence of the sport there. In one hour's
fishing he caught fifty-five trout, an aver
age of nearly one each minute for that j
period. The trout averaged from seven to I
twelve inches in length. Mr. Young says
he never saw so many fish in any river at
one time as are in the Garcia.
The striped bass fishing in the estuary
between Oakland and Alameda and In San
Leandro Bay has been a blank recently.
the fish refusing any bait offered. Men
who have gone In quest of them report
them plentiful, but they are not to be
tempted into striking.
Fish Commissioners Vogelsang and Kel
ler are in Monterey to-day. They will
hardly come away without trying the
salmon fishing which is so tempting at
present.
William H. Hanson. Frank Frost and
John W. Bourdette have returned from
Lake Tahoe and vicinity after an absence
of one month. They report the fishing ex
cellent. On Rubicon River, the Eastern
brook trout and rainbows are quite plen
tiful and provide fair catches. The best
of the fishing, however, was on Grass
Lake and Susie Lake, where large catches
were made, the fish rising to the fly and
taking it ravenously.

CUPID, THE GREAT SIRE, AND
HIS PROGENY.
IT was not until within the past year
that Cupid, the property of the Aptos
stock farm of A. B. Spreckeis, began
to attract attention from the harness
horse world. The son of Sidney and
Venus, while not a sensational performer,
was always fighting for the money, no
matter how long drawn out the race may
have been, earning for himself the title
"games, of the Sidneys." But three of
his get have been placed in training. Of
this trio Venus 11. his fast but a trifle er
ratic daughter, in the string of Tom Keat-
Ing, which lowered her record to 2:12% in
a fiercely contested race at Buffalo on
August 9, is considered one of the coming
stars of the turf. Psyche and Bottle
Parkes are still in the green class and will
be seen on the California circuit. The
former is considered a most promising
green 'un at the Aptos establishment, is
a yearling by this horse from the great
mare Hulda (2:08%), which is pronounced
by critics to be one of the grandest look
ing youngsters ever turned out in this

SPORTS OF THE
WORLD CAN BE
ENJOYED HERE
Deer, Bear and Other Game in
Abundance.
Preservation of These Attracts the
Attention of the Public â Reports
From the Field.
The wonders of California as a resort
for sportsmen are apparently but little
understood by the people here. Within a
da; travel of this city one can have his
choice of game and can find it in com
parative abundance. litis carries him
outside the zone of travel of the men
from the metropolis, who seldom have
sufficient leisure to go far afield for their
shooting. In Trinity. Humboldt and Men
docino counties, which are off the line of
travel, deer, bear and other big game is
found readily. Whether it is that pros
perity is abroad In the land, there never
was a time when the high-class sports
of the field attracted so many people.
With a due regard for the preservation
of game this will go on until it attracts
the attention of men who now go abroad
for their sports.
That there is a lively interest taken in
the preservation of game is evidenced by
the expressions of approval over the con
viction of O'Brien & Spptorno's sales
man for having ducks in his possession
out of season. Judge Treadwell's firm
stand in the face of the strongest pres
sure has gained favor for him among the
sportsmen.
W. I). Mc Art bur. H. L*. Miller. J. J.
Winner and 1". B. Surryhne spent last
week-end on the Olympic Gun Club pre
serve, Cordelia. They secured a good bag
of doves.
J. H. Rosseter and John Hal tan of Ala
meda have returned from Trinity County,
where they have been camping for some
weeks. They bring back the skins of two
California lions and report finding all
kinds of game in abundance. They en
joyed trout fishing with spoon and lly In
the Eel River.
The members of the Olympic Gun Club
will hold their Hrst "varmint" hunt on
the 27th inst. The scene will be the club's
preserve In Marin County, the Rodgers
ranch. Only those animals which prey
upon game birds or destroy their eggs
will be sought. The gunmen will be in
the field from 7 a. m. until 2 p. m. and
will kill no birds- nor animals that are not
scheduled on the score card with which
each member will be supplied. The points
allowed on each animal killed are as fol
lows:
Coyote, 1000: wildcat, 1000; fox, 500; coon, 500;
eagle, 600; polecat, 250: ground squirrel. 250;
quail hawk. 250; large hawk, 250; small hawk,
100; weasel, 50; Jack rabbit, 25; bluejay, 25.
"Weare C. Little Jr. of Oakland was suc
cessful in his quest for deer In Lake Coun
ty. With a companion he killed four fine
bucks some six miles north of Highland
Springs. One of the deer weighed 122
pounds when dressed.
Peter Krog and three friends secured
seven deer near Rockpile ranch, Sonoma
County.
The members of the San Francisco Gun
Club will hold their last bluerock shoot of
the season to-morrow at the Lincoln Club
grounds, Alameda. Harry Rlcklefson
leads Edgar Forster by three birds for
the silver cup presented by Otto Feudner.
The last twenty-five-bird race will decide
the ownership of the trophy, as the man
making the highest average in four shoots
wins. E. Schultz and A. J. Webb are tied
for first money on the season's average.

MONTEREY THE
RENDEZVOUS OF
TENNIS LOVERS
Players Will Ply Their Rackets
in Doubles.
Annual Championships of Pacific States
Lawn Tennis Association Also at
Del Monte on Admission Day.
"Ho for Del Monte!" is the cry among
the tennis men. and there will be a pro
cession of racket wielders Monterey
bound next Wednesday and Thursday to
play in the handicap doubles tournament.
Everything else has been neglected among
the chasers of the tennis ball for this
event, which will be covered with a dress
of society.
As far as tennis goes, the tournament
will not produce much of the real cham
pionship order, as the players are not out
for medals; nor do they expect to show
the full capabilities of their racket facul
ties. The teams will be more or less
Impromptu, but this will not deteriorate
the interest in the matches. Probably
for the first time in several years there
will be the. influence of ultra-society to
make the tournament the success of for
mer years, when every woman or man on
the crest of Its waves patronized the
sport.
Not only will the racket wielders come â 
from San Francisco, Oakland and Ala
meda, but a large contingent of players
is already ensconced at Del Monte. Many
surprises will be in store for the young ]
players, who think the honors of the two
days' battle will surely grace their stand- !
ards. Men who have won the fairest
court prizes of other years will doff their
blazers and work on the courts on the 18th
and 19th against the younger and more
arrogant blood.
While the full list of teams has not yet
been entered, the great majority of them
are already in. They are as follows:
Dr. C. B. Root and Ralph Bliven; J. Beale
and Chester Smith; Arthur Watson and
Barclay Henley Jr.; Grant Smith and
Harry Weihe; Merle Johnson and W. 15.
Collier Jr. (all of the California Club of
this city); Luke Warburton and Robert
IFatje of Santa Clara; McSwain and Jor
dan of San Jose; Jones brothers of Sa
linas; Harper brothers of Pacific Grove;
; Carl Selbach and Howard Hammond of
, Stockton; J. A. Landsberger and Reuben
Hunt of Alameda; Samuel Hardy of Oak
: land, and J. A. Code of San Francisco.
I George Whitney and Joe Daily will give
[ an exhibition singles during the tourna
j ment.
The officials of the Pacific States Lawn
Tennis Association met last Monday night
to arrange for the championship doubles
tournament on September 9. It was de
cided to hold the tournament at Del
Monte. The ladies' singles championship
of the coast will also be played at the
same time. The tournament will begin
on the Tth and be concluded on Admission
day. J. A. Code of San Francisco J. A.
Landsberger of Alameda and Sumner
Hardy of Oakland have the arrangement
of the tournament in hand. A number of
ladies have signified their intention of
entering the tournament this year.
Among the contestants for championship
honors will be Alice Hoffman. Miss
Hunter. Miss Eisen, Miss Clark Miss
Miriam Halt, Miss Violet 11. Sutton and
Miss Dobbins. It is hardly likely that
Miss Marion Jones, who won the "cham
pionship of the coast last year and the
highest tenni* honors in the United States
at Newport this season, will contest

FAST OARSMEN
AND SWIMMERS
FOR ASTORIA
Carnival to-"lnd_<-e- Alt Sorts of
Aquatics.
Scullers and Crews From British Colum
bia and Oregon Will Row
in the Regatta.
The programme of the sixth annual re
gatta and water carnival to be held at
Astoria on the -Ist, 22d and 23d Inst, has
been definitely arranged. There will be
a military and civic parade on the morn
ing of the 21st, to be followed by the
singing of national airs by a chorus of
five hundred voices, addresses of welcome
by the Governor of Oregon and the
Mayor of Astoria and the crowning of
the carnival queen. The United States
training ship Adams and the United
States protected cruiser Badger, manned
by the naval reserve of Oregon, will be
in attendance, and there will be a big
fleet of gayly decorated boats. Among
the oarsmen who will compete at the re
gatta will be crews and single scullers
from the Ariel Rowing Club, the Alameda
Boating Club and the .University of Cali
fornia; from James Bay, Victoria and
Vancouver in British Columbia, and from
Portland and Astoria in Oregon. The pro
! gramme will include single shell, out
rigged skiff, double sculling and senior
and junior four-oared barge races for the
; oarsmen. There will also be races be
tween fish boats, sloop yachts, scow
schooners, gasoline launches, steam
launches. tubs and whitehalls. The
equatic sports will include swimming
races, tug-of-war in fish boats, log roll
ing contests, net contests, obstacle races,
! Chinese boat and Indian canoe races,
I duck hunt, high diving and other fea
tures. Exhibitions of life-saving drill
! will be given by crews from Fort Canby
and Fort Stevens. Dr. Riehl of the Dol
phin Swimming and Boating Club of this
city will exhibit his life-saving kite. On
the evening ot the 21st there will be a
ball, at which the queen of the carnival
and attendants will be present. On the
evening of the 2.*.d there will be a marine
' parade of illuminated boats, a balloon
ascension and parachute jump, and walk
ing over the water on tight rope and slack
wire. There will also lie baseball, foot-
I ball and other athletic games.
I The Pacific Nothwest Association of th..
1 Amateur Athletic Union will hold its an
nual meeting on Saturday, the 19th, and
; the programme will include track and
field events. Among these will be 100
--yard, 220-yard, quarter-mile, half-mile
and one-mile races, high jump, broad
jump, pole vault, hammer throw and
bicycle racing.
The University of California will send
its four-oared crew to Astoria to com
pete in the barge races. The crew has
secured the use of the Olympic barge,
through the ---forts of George James, cap
. tain of the Olympic Club. Ray Fryer
came up from Pomona on Tuesday and
went into training at once. The crew will
be made up as follows: J. Hopper, bow;
F. Waggershauser, No. 2; Ray Fryer. No.
'_; Tracey, stroke, and E. Hammer,
cockswain. As the university boys do not
wish to seem to have any advantage not
enjoyed by their brother oarsmen, it is
probable that Al Lean, the trainer, will
not accompany them to Astoria. The uni
versity may enter the junior as well as
the senior* barge race, as the junior race
won by them at 1.1 Campo on June 25 was
not a championship event. J. Hopper may
j go up to Stockton to-day to confer with
j the directors of the Stockton AthleUc
Association and try -to induce them to
1 loan their fast barge to the university
] crew.
H. A. Widemann does not expect to be
able to go to Astoria, but J. A. Geddes
and J. Redican of the Lurline Swimming
! Club will enter the swimming events at
the northern carnival.
The Alameda seniors are practicing
j every night and are in better condition
| than they have ever been. They are cer
tain to render a good account of them
selves. C. L. Ochs of the Pioneers is
; training for the shell race and H. Witt-
I kopf of the Ariels will pull in it also. The
i Alameda Boat Club Is in a flourishing
} financial condition, having no debts out
standing and more than $250 In the treas
! ury. There are ninety-seven members in
j good standing. The following officers were
elected at a recent meeting: Charles H.
Smith, president: H. W. Maass', vice
president; W. B. Hinchman, secretary;
Julius C. Stamer. financial secretary;
David Greenleaf. treasurer; W. G. Han
sen, captain; John G. Lewis, lieutenant
captain; James Lewis, sergeant at arms;
Joseph H. Timmons. Frederick S. Cone,
and Arthur G. Brown, members' of exec
utive board. Several former members of
the club are in the First California Regi
ment and on their return an entertain
ment will be given in their honor by the
boat club.
RACE FOR BASEBALL
PENNANT IS CLOSE
Uncle Hank's Team Still Maintains Its
Grasp on First Place â San Jose
and Sacramento Tie.
The race for the baseball pennant has
not abated, although the San Francisco
team leads well in the front rank. A new
phase to the struggle ls the tie for a place
between Sacramento and San Jose. This
week's games mean much to both teams
and the tide of battle will force either
team a step above or below In the column.

at Recreation Park this afternoon. Oak

Watsonville and repeated the dose Sunday

NOT A FAIR SPEED TEST
CALMS ENCOUNTERED BY THE
| OLD YACHT.
Â«
Bun of the New York Club Fleet From
Vineyard Haven, to New Bed
ford Proves Almost a
Fizzle.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW BEDFORD, Mass., Aug. ll.âThe
run of the New York Yacht Club fleet i
from Vineyard Haven to-day to this port |
proved the most unsatisfactory of the j
cruise, and as far as the racing was con- ]
cerned was well nigh a fizzle. All day the :
yachts wrestled with typical dog day con
ditions, winds from all quarters and all
velocities, interspersed with cold rain,
sunshine and fog. and the boat carrying
a mascot won In her class. The Columbia
was one of these, and for the second time
in the cruise she beat the Defender by
many '. miles because of the shifting
breezes and calms. In fact so far ahead
was the new boat at the finish that the
Defender gave up entirely and dl not
round one of the marks, the Vineyard
Sound lightship.
At one time during the day, about noon,
It looked as if the Defender had the mas
cot and might win, for she got a line shift
of wind and left the Columbia becalmed
two miles astern. But this seemingly for
tunate shift proved the Defender s un
doing, the breeze leaving her entirely
when off Tarpaulin Cove, five miles from
the start, and she lay there two hours,
while her rival, farther out in the sound,
picked up a nice southwest breeze and
made the gain that effectually put the
Defender out of the race. , _ .
The Columbia was out beyond Cutty
hunk before the Defender was moved,
over ten miles astern. But the Columbia
had a hard time ting out to the light
ship five miles farther off, and did not
round it until 2:12 o'clock. Then she
floundered about in another calm for a
half hour, until at last she caught a
northeast breeze out of Buzzards Bay that
took her to the finish line. She passed one
side of Cuttyhunk Island as the De
fender was going by the other, beating
out of Vineyard Sound with a southwest
breeze, while the Columbia, three miles
away, over the island, was beating in
against a northeast wind. â¢ The Columbia
crossed the finish line about 5 o'clock,
with the Defender off Cuttyhunk light, at
the entrance to Buzzards Bay.
The other yachts of the fleet sailed a
much shorter course than the two fliers,
running in through Quicks Hole, half way
down the Cuttyhunk, finishing at th flag
ship and anchoring off Wilkes Lodge, in
the middle of Buzzards Bay. five or six
miles outside of New Bedford. The Na
vahoe was the first of the big ones over
the line, the Vigilant being three minutes
later. The two old-timers had a fine race
up the sound, and at one time the Nava
hoe outsailed her rival. The soft spots In
the wind and the frequent shifts struck
them and the Vigilant slipped through
Quicks Hole first
The Colohla was the first at this point
in the schooner class, while the lloriana
led the little boats. The wind left the
boats entirely- in Buzzards Bay, and for
another hour they were, almost, motion
less. At last the Vigilant crossed the lino
i:i her usual position at the head of the
fleet, while the Colonla drifted over ahead
of the schooners. A breeze which came
from the northeast during the latter part
of the afternoon helped tut those of ..the
fleet that followed the Defender into "the
trap at Tarpaulin Cove, and at half-past 5
all had finished and were heading for the
an eh ii rage.
It seemed too bad that a day that began
so auspiciously should have resulted so
unfortunately and that the sequence of
good runs of the fleet should have been
broken thereby.

out the sixth man. Th- first four men
made a nice race of it, Boaj winning -in
the stretch. '
The added race was a three-mile ama

VALUABLE DOGS POISONED.
The most cowardly of all men, the dog
X.oisoner, has been at work again, and the
coast has lost three promising dogs in
as many breeds. Congress Springs was
the scene of his operations. One of the
murdered dogs was Irving C. Ackerman's
young bloodhound Rodger, breeder John
Quizzes, by. Brigadier out of Madge.
This good and truly typical specimen of
the breed, whose two first prizes at the
last San Francisco show were well merit
ed promised to develop into a phenom
enon. The second unfortunate animal was
Philip C. Meyers' recent importation, the
rough-coated St. Bernard Canadian Pil
grim bred by J. S. Williams, by Refuge
111 ex Lady Mac. Pilgrim was a line
animal with a splendid coat, good head
and body and a good mover. His win
nings in the show were: Very highly com
mended in the novice class, second in the
limit class and very highly commended
in the open class. The third and last
member of the trio was Miss May Hy
man's black cocker spaniel puppy Miss
Frisco, t,v Duffy out of Brown Nellie,
which took the reserve In her class at the
late show. The San Francisco Kennel
Club directors will hold a meeting next
week and it is understood that they will
materially increase the rewards already
offered. , _j_ _ .
Fred Holmes has bought a young Irish
terrier flog by Champion Endcliffe Match
box to breed to his bitch Trilby. The lat
ter is undersized, and as his new dog is
inclined the other way the result should
be satisfactory. Mr. Holmes will prob
ably have a large demand for the services
of his new importation. lb- has also
practically completed negotiations for the
acquisition of a puppy by the late cham
pion' St. Bernard Sir Ethelwood, which will
lend interest to the probably keen com
petition at the next San Francisco show.
The secretary of the Pacific Mastiff Club
D about to extend his present canine fan
cies to another breed, namely, the Boston
terriers. With these, in addition to mas
tiffs nd fox-terriers, the Montez Ken
nels should be well represented on the
bench. _________

Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Aug. George Dixon, \
the colored feather-weight champion, and
Eddie Santry of Chicago met' to-night be
fore the Broadway Athletic Club for twen
ty rounds at 125 pounds, and Referee
Johnny White declared the bout a draw.
The clubhouse was crowded to its utmost
limit, nearly 'sooo persons 'being present.
Dixon put up a game exhibition, and |
Santry showed wonderful '.^improvement,
since he appeared here. last. Santry's ad
vantage in height stood him in good stead., !
and the way. he dodged . his head away j
from a great many of Dixon's, leads was
extremely clever. â  .-â¢ â¢* â 
Dixon at times was wild and he fre
quently overreached himself, using. poor
judgment as to distance. Santry went
right to his man, and from, the very be
ginning showed that he meant to fight
without adopting sprinting tactics. Tom ,
O'Rourke, Tom Sharkey and Charley
Miner were Dixon's seconds, while Johnny
Gorman, Charley Burns and Jack Quinn
were Santry's. -Â *,â.... \
In the opening round Dixon was the ag
gressor, with honors. about even. -A lett
swing from Dixon in the second landed on
Santry's eye, and the Chicagoan fought
back Viciously, driving his right to the
body, and at close quarters bringing it up
to the head. George was wild with his i- ft
swings in that round, as well as in the
third, but he managed to get his left hard j
to the wind. ___ , _Â . i
In the fourth round Dixon s right eye
was reopened with a right swing from
Santry and the latter paid attention
to this mark throughout the rest of the .
fl At 'the close of the eighth round Dixon
swung his right on Santry's head. Eddie
replied with a similar blow, landing back
of the neck,* and Dixon stumbled as the ,
gong. rang. When Santry went to his cor
ner his nose was bleeding. |
.During the ninth Dixon's left ear was
burst -with' a right swing, but ho kept
throwing his left to the body. In the
tenth Dixon landed a back-hand blow
with his left- and followed' with a hard
right "to the body. From this to the end
of nineteenth round it was a dingdong .
contest, with Dixon mainly in the aggres
sive and Santry blocking very cleverly
Dixon came like a whirlwind in the last
round, forcing and rushing but neither ,
had any decided advantage at the finish.
Tommy Sullivan of Brooklyn and Jim
my Devers of this city met in the prelim
inary. They fought twenty rounds. Each
weighed 120 pounds. Sullivan won.
PACIFIC CRICKETERS
TO PLAY SANTA CRUZ
A Strong Team Will Leave This Aft- j
ernoon for the Seaside No Team
From Los Angeles.
The visit of a cricket eleven from Los
Angeles to this city will not take place |
during the present season. The local lov
era of the British game were not in a j
position to contribute half the traveling
expenses of the Southerners, and the Cal
ifornia Cricket Association officials did
not believe any money could be made by
hiring an inclosed ground and charging
an admission. Four or five of the South
ern players are willing to come in any
caÂ«e but a full team cannot be obtained.
The' Los Angeles Cricket Club is trying
to arrange a match with a San Luis Rey
eleven at Oceanside, San Diego County,
and also with a Santa Monica team at
Santa Monica. Teams from Los Angeles
have visited Oceanside in previous years.
The Dos Angeles in- get most of their
Dlav during the winter. .
' The California Club will play against
the Alameda eleven to-morrow, and will
m-,ke every effort to put a strong team
â¢ the field. If it wins the match it will
be almost certain to carry off the Brown
pennant for 1899. A victory to-morrow
will make the California* dormy 4, to
use the language of the links; that is, the
Californias will have four games to their
credit with only four more matches to be
nlaved if they succeed in even making a
draw of any one of those four games It
will add half a point to their score and
place th.m at the head of the city clubs.
The California representatives in to-mor
row's match will be chosen from E. G.

A team of Pacific cricketers will leave
this afternoon for Santa Cruz, where they
will nlay a match to-morrow against an
eleven of the Santa Cruz County Club.
The Pacific team will consist of George
Theobald.' C. Simmonds, J. Myers, Fane
Sewell A. G. Sheath. C. P. Coles, J. H.
Harbour E. F. Musson, W. McDonald.
H C Cassidv and A. W. Wilding. The
Santa Cruz Club is not affiliated with the
association, but the delegates of the city
clubs on being consulted, consented
unanimously to the match being played.
It has been agreed, however, that the re
sults in batting and bowling shall not
be reckoned in calculating the averages
for the Burnell prizes. The Santa Cruz
players will put the visitors up at ths
St "George Hotel and will be their hosts
during their stay. The Santa Cruz Coun
ty Club numbers about twenty-five crick
eters among its members, and will join
the association next season.
F W. Beakbane, of the Burns Valley
Club in Lake County, recently paid a visit
to this city. The cricketers of Lake

San Francisco players this year.
OARSMEN AT GTJERNE
Will Hold a Water Carnival on Rus

mpionship at El Campo.
At a meeting of the Pacific Association
of the Amateur Athletic Union held last
night the following delegates were pres
ent: J. R. Bookman. S. J. Pembroke, W.
C. Espy, W. R. Berry, H. A. Keeler,
George James and A. P. Rothkopf. Pres
ident J. R. Bookman suggested that a
handbook be published giving records in.
all the departments of amateur sports,
and that special care be taken to secure
accuracy. The records committee, con
sisting. of H. A. Keeler, George James and
Herbert Hauser, already has on hand a
mass of statistics which are to be put
Into shape.
On the adjournment of the general com
mittee a meeting of the regatta commit
tee was held, at which it was decided that
a water carnival shall be held at Guerne
ville on September 17, tfiv California
Northwestern Railway having made a
satisfactory proposal to the regatta com
mittee. R. X. Ryan, general manager of
the railway, has offered a special prize
for an outrigger skiff race. A chamn.lon
ship regatta will be held at El Campo on
October 17, at which It is hoped that barge
crews from Stanford University and <the
University of California will be seen in
competition. It was stated that a rowing
course might without much difficulty be
created near Palo Alto on which the stu
dents can practice. .
FIRE FREAKS..
j Strange Occurrences That Are j Re
corded of Conflagrations. ]7_
[ One would imagine that the last place i
| in the world where one would expect a
fire to break out would be some twenty- ;
I five feet below the surface of the sea.'
| Nevertheless, a workman employed in
| laying the foundations of a seawall at
! Plymouth, England, enjoyed, if we may
j use the expression In this instance, this
I strange and awful experience some time
' ago. ---.' â -"-'" 'â â 'â ''-
The man had to descend in a diving
I bell, ' which at the top was fitted with
' heavy circular convex glasses, and as the
! sea was very calm these glasses concen
trated the rays on one spot on the work
' mans clothes, with the result that they
i were set on fire. A somewhat similar fire
was occasioned, in the shop of a chemist,
I the sun's rays being focused by the large
i glass bottles In the windows on to some
i combustible material that did not belie
| its character. â¢ _
With the exception of a fire under water,
perhaps the next most unlikely place one ;
; would â  imagine a fire to break out in
would be an icehouse, but even with a I
' temperature considerably below zero a !
lire Is not impossible, as was proved in :
, May, 1897, at a cold-storage warehouse of .
a large New York firm. â¢ .
When the firemen were fighting the i
I flames a large tank containing ammonia, j
used In making artificial ice, exploded, I
! spreading dense fumes In every direction, i
1 and it was not until after several hours !
j hard work, amid the most intense cold
and suffocating fumes, occasioned by the
I ammonia, that the fire was got under con
â  trol, at the expense of one man s life and
I terrible sufferings on the part of others,
I occasioned by the poisonous gases and the
1 frigidity of the atmosphere.
Shortly afterward the works of the
1 Geneva "ice Company caught fire, and the
bouses engine room, etc., were completely
! gutted, leaving the large masses of ice
â  , standing alone like so many icebergs
amid the smoke occasioned by the smol
dering ruinsâ remarkable effect.
About a year ago the firemen who
! had to attend to an outbreak of fire at
Brock & Co.'s warehouse, Liverpool, were
â  greatly impeded by the suffocating flames |
' occasioned by the burning of large masses i
of salt that burned with a vivid blue light.
' Not only were the fumes disagreeable but j
- ! there were other unpleasant features of i
I this fire in the shape of flakes of partially â 
; consumed salt that made the atmosphere
black and which occasioned an extraor
dinary effect on the spectators' eyes.
A similar effect to a certain extent was |
' I the result of a flre-tat the extensive color |
works of Messrs. Speir of Cologne, which |
â  ! resulted in a loss estimated at several mil- '
1 lion marks, hut in this instance the fire !
. ; occasioned a fall of colored rain In the
1 A V upper Valley. - ....
' The mystery in which the origin of
. many fires is shrouded is really not very
j extraordinary in view of the thousand
â¢ and one ways fires can be occasioned, es
. becially when we consider that the orig
i inator is frequently destroyed before the
fire is put out. Last March at Thornton
i Heath a cat caught fire in the sitting room
i of a shop and then rushed into the shop
itself, speedily setting it ablaze. This was
â¢ a curious origin of a fire, but- the case of ,
. j a fire at Louviers was even more extraor- |
j dinary. , ' ,' ;_';â 'â :
, j In this instance a horse washed with |
i paraffin to cure it of a certain complaint !
was left enveloped in. a rug; apparently
: ' the horse became restless, and It is |
i imagined began to paw the stone-paved !
i floor of its stable with its hoofs, with the
i resXilt that the sparks occasioned by. the
Striking of the steel horseshoes on the i
stone floor set' fire to the- poor animal, :
. : which, in turn, set fire to the stable.
which was gutted.
When the English cricketers were over
in Australia one of the reports of the
matches mentioned that owing to tne
bush fires the light was very bad; to
show how bad these fires can be we have
only to mention that during the four worst ;
: I days at a single lighthouse on the coast â¢
. : there were used '- X "i rockets in order to i
locate its position to passing vesselsâ a i
j supply sufficient under ordinary circum-
Stances to last a year.
In California, some time ago, a fire was
â¢ extinguished by having wine poured on
It in the absence of water, while cider
on another occasion was used for a like j
i purpose; but without doubt the fire that â¢
I put :fself out is the most highly to be
! commended. !
Some time ago a fire was occasioned I
I in Melbourne by. rats gnawing some wax !
matches; the heat, however, molted some :
leaden water pipes, and the volume of,
] escaning water extengulshed the flames. I
If it had finished its task and let the mat-
I ter rest there all would have ended well;
I but unfortunately the water once started
l continued to flow, with the result that the
premises were flooded instead of gutted.

WON'T PLAY BURGLAR AGAIN.
An Indiana man Whose Joke rroveci
tc Be Expensive.
Down in Fountain County, Indiana,
there was an earthquake shock about a ;
week ago, and Mrs. John Welch of Cov- i
ington thought it was a burglar.
She had just started from the parlor
Into her darkened bedroom when she
heard a glass-and-silver perfumery flask
on her dresser jingle as if it had been hit
and almost tipped over. At the instant
her feet were tangled in the rug at the
threshold, but she fled,, frightened and
dizzy, and called for help.
When her husband came he turned on
the light in the bedroom, and then felt
the second shock. He plainly saw the per
fumery flask rocking, on the marble, and
having traveled in Spanish America knew
what was wrong. From the heights of
his superior information he thought he
would have a little fun at his wife's ex
pense. So he quickly flung a scarf about \
his head, by way of disguise, and ranâ
stooping lowâ from the room.
And his helpmeet, scared to blindness
and half dead with a nausea, yet rallied,
and hurled a spirit lamp at the fleeing fig
ure.
When Mr. Welch had finished playing
the joke, and his neighbors had put out
the fire, he bathed his burns with vaseline
and told the , spectators they needn't
laugh so hard. He didn't make a fool of
himself, except on the recurrence of earth
quakesâwhich are rare in Indiana.
But the insurance adjusters refused to
allow his claims, either for fire or accident
losses.â Chicago Chronicle.

How He Missed His Diamond Stud.
One of the guests of the Barthnldi Hotel,
who represents a large concern near
Pittsburg, upset the entire hotel staff yes
terday. He appeared at the office and no
tified the head clerk that he had been
robbed of his $250 diamond stud, which
had been taken from his shirt front. The
night clerk was questioned, but no one
had any knowledge of the robbery. The
proprietor was appealed to and he said
he never suspected any one connected
with the house. The guest went out about
his business. He worried all day about
his loss, and reluctantly retired to his
room at night, sorry that he had not told
the police. Pulling off his shirt he dis
covered that he had put it on back to the
front. There was his stud in its proper
place. He had carried it all day on his
back.â New York Correspondence Pitts

SILENT TRAVELERS.
A Rural Passenger Strikes a- Still
V Crowd/in a Parlor Car.
In a parlor car that was. pulled out .of
Baitimore-a few days ago were six rav
eling men, headed for Now York/ The
ccnvontionalities to acquaintanceship in
society are not observed by traveling
met., but in this case it happened that the
six preferred their newspapers t i stone.-?,
etc., and each retired with hims _'.! sl-ow
in;: that he wanted to be let alone.
At the first stop an old man boar the
tram, and he, too, had a chair in the par
lor car. for the first time fti his life, as he
told the conductor. He got lonesome and
started in to get acquainted. He picked
out the biggest manâ an amiable, Tom
Reed looking traveler from Minneapolis.
"Wher's the depot for Boston? was the
first query of the old man.
Tne big man was not quite prepared to
break the rule of silence established by
his confreres, and made no reply. The old
man waited about as long as an impatient
old man can be expected to wait, a_ia
made another attack.
"I m goin' to Boston when I get to Netv
York, and I want to know if ye know
wher' the Boston depot is." .
The big man looked at the inquirer, but
; said nothing. Once more the old man re
i turnee, on a higher key:

in New York?" . * _ , â',~
The big traveler grunted, shook his
I head and closed his eyes. ] The old man
i turned to the second traveler, looked him
I over and yelled: ___ ,
"I'm goln' to Boston. Do you know
'< wher's the depot for Boston, in New
! York?" ' . '_", ' _
The second man had taken his cue from
the Minneapolis man, and made no reply.
The old man passed to the third traveler
and shook his arm to make sure he was
alive.
"I'm goin' to Boston '"â ";__â¢"â _ ,
But the third man turned his face and
closed his eyes. ' _ â 
"Say, I'm g"in' " was as far as he
got with the fourth man; he had no better
luck with the others.
Just then the conductor, who had seen
and heard the act, passed through. The
old man stopped him and asked him what
was the matter with all the passengers in
hat car. The conductor was a fat man
himself and out for fun. -He said: . -
"There's going to be a convention of
the deaf and dumb in New York, and ad
these men- are delegates." -Â â 
The . old . man looked them â¢ over again
hastily, and exclaimed:
''Faith, and they're, a lot of dom foine
! looking fellers, but dom poor company.
i When the train reached. the shed at, Jer-
I sey City the six' travelers lined up and
I said all together, in comic opera style:
' "Ha, ha, ha! Wher's the depot for Bos
ton?" , â  \"l2

I up "so instantly that it knocked off hi-.

DUKE REWARDS AND PUNISHES
Honesty and Dishonesty Adequately |
Recompensed This Time.
The late Duke of Buccleuch, in one of
his walks, purchased a cow in the neigh
borhood of Dalkeith, which was to be sent
to his palace on the following morning.
The Duke, in his morning dress, espied the I
boy ineffectually attempting to drive the
animal forward to its destination. The
boy 1 ; not knowing the Duke, bawled out to
him, "Hie, mun. come here an' gie's a
han' wl' this beast."
The Duke walked on slowly, the boy
still craving his assistance, and at last, in
a tone of distress, exclaimed. "Come here,
mun, an' help us, an' I'll gi'e you half I
get." The Duke went and lent the helping
hand.
"And now," said the Duke, as they
trudged along, "how much do you think
veil get for this job?"
"Oh, I dinna ken," said the boy, "but
I'm sure o' something, for the folk up at
the big house are gride to a' bodies."
A. they approached the house the Duke
disappeared from the- boy and entered by
a different way. Calling a servant, he
put a sovereign in his hand, saying: "Give
that to the boy who brought- the cow."
The Duke having returned to the avenue
was soon re lined by the boy. ,
"Well, how much did you get?" said the
Duke. - '
"A .shilling," said the boy, "an' there s
half o' it t'ye." _
"But surely, you got more than a shill
ing." said the Duke.
"No," said the boy. "that's a I gotâ and
d'ye no think it's plenty?"
"I do not," said the Duke; "there must
be some mistake, and as I am acquainted
with the Duke, if you return I think I'll
get you more." - .
They went back, the Duke rang the bell
and ordered all the servants to be assem
bled. .. - , . -
"Now." said the Duke to the boy, "point
me out the person that gave you the shill
ing." â¢ , ,
"It was that chap there." pointing to
the butler. The butler confessed and at
tempted an apology, but the Duke indig
nantly ordered him to give the boy the j
sovereign. "You have lost." said the i
Duke, "your money, your situation and I
your character by your covetous'
iearn henceforth that 'honesty is the best â¢
policy.' " . Â ,
The boy by this time recognized his as
sistant in the person of the Duke, and the
Duke was so delighted with the sterling
worth and honesty of the boy that he or
dered him to be sent to school at his ex
pense.âWeekly Telegraph.

Justifiable Profanity.
"What is the charge against this man?' t
asked Justice Potts of Jersey City, when I
William J. Dunn, a ruddy-faced pilot, was
arraigned yesterday.
"Profanity, your Honor, said Police- 1
man Gibson. "Wow: but he did use strong
language." _._ Â
"Justifiable profanity, your Honor, said
the prisoner. "Perfectly justifiable. I had
to wait half an hour at Liberty street,
New York, for a boat. "When* I got to the
other side I found that my train would
not start for half an hour. I walked
around to kill time, and when I returned
mv train had just gone. I decided to
come back to New York, and was In
formed that there would not be another
boat for half an hour. Then *T became
angry, and I admit that I might have
used "some pretty strong language."
"I don't blame you for losing your tem
per " said the court. "I might have done
the' same myself. Discharged."â New- .
I York World.
Armor Plate for Bank Vaults.
A Pittsburg trust company has lately
erected a vault, composed of steel armor
plates, which possesses some novel fea
tures. It is nineteen and a half feet by
sixteen and a half feet by nine and a
half feet. The entire front of the vault
is of a single plate or armor eight inches
thick. This is reinforced by a nickel- i
steel plate of the same size only six and
a half inches thick. Therefore the total
thickness is fourteen and a half inches. ;
The door is in the front, and the bolt
work of the door radiates from the center
like spokes from a hub. The armor plates
are dovetailed together and clamped from
the inside. If desired, plates twenty-two
inches thick .can bo used, thus avoiding
the use of bolts. It is thought that ar
mor plate vaults possess remarkable ad
vantages over the old laminated plates.
Other banks are about to adopt the new
system.

Of the 5400 bales on hand July 1, 1899. only
about 2230 bales were of the 1898 crop, the bal
ance being mostly remnants from' the 1895
crop.
On August 1, 1899, there were less than 1000
bales of the IS9S crop remaining unshipped, and
the bulk of these have been sold to brewers
and are here awaiting shipment.
During 1898-9 the brewers on 'â¢â¢'â¢ Pacific coast
only purchased 3200 bales, as against 5800 bales
the year before. This does not mean a less
ened output of beer or that brewers use less
hops to the barrel than usual, but it indicates
that, brewers have worked into and used up
their reserve stock. We believe that this is
true of the entire United States and that the
brewers all over -he world are going into the
new season with the lightest stock ever known,
while everywhere stocks in dealers' hands are
practically exhausted.
On Jul. 1, IS9B, there were 20,700 bales remain
ing unshipped on the Pacific coast, while on
July 1 1899, there were only 5400 bales of all
grades', including about 1500 bales of the 189..
crop unfit for brewing purposes.

NEW YORK. Aug. ll.âThe stock market
made som. show of activity and strength in
the early dealings to-day, but the movement
had about exhausted itself before the end of
the first hour. The heavy tone In railroad
stocks affected the industrials, which had start
ed to go up. and realizing set in which helped
the bears. The market refused to go up again
and drifted quite aimlessly for the rest of the
day the volume of business falling .to the low
est ebb. The stocks which made the early ac
tivity were iron and steel and leather.
Borne of- the former â  group had quite
handsome net gains remaining at the close of
the day. Federal Steel and Colorado Fuel being
the only ones In the group .to show net losses.
Tennessee Coal as still foremost In the move
ment and touched *': -_. but failed to make Its
net gain a whole point. There was a tremen
dous scramble to take on United States Leather
and the price touched 10%. Practically the
whole of its gain was wiped out in a realizing
movement and the preferred stock closed below
last night. There was a midday demand for
Mexican Central and Mexican National, which
was unexplained In the day's news. Oregon
Navigation lost 2% of Its recent rise. A few
railroad stocks showed fractional gains, but the
gener--l tone was heavy.
Call loans were about steady to-day, and the
decline to 2 '-_ late in the dealings was of little
significance, as it occurred after most of the
demand had been satisfied.
.Movements in bonds were sluggish and ir
regular and business was not large. Total
sales, par value, $1,093,000.
United States new fours advanced % in the

| Bradstreet's Financial Review.
I
A __ ;- â  â Â» I
NEW YORK. Aug. 11.â Bradstreet's financial
review to-morrow will say:
A rather bullish temper prevailed this week I
in spite of the continuance of narrow profes- I
sional speculation. A slight relaxation of call !
loan rates, which though by no means general j
nor to all appearances assuredly permanent, |
resulted In quotations* of 2%r<.3% per cent :
toward the end of the week, had a good ef
fect and supplemented the favorable conclu
sions of Wall street about the crops and their
results in connection with railroad traffic and
earnings. There was a disposition to take an
exaggerated view of the significance of the
Secretary of the Treasury's order to resume the
issue of gold certificates to the extent of $10,
--000,000. The plausible view of this matter is j
that it is an experiment which if successful I
in relieving the demand for notes will be fol- j
lowed by the return of the more or less re
stricted Issue of . the certificates In question. ;
The market, however, was influenced for a
moment by unfounded reports that the plans
of the Treasury included an Increase in the |
Government's national bank deposits, or other
measures calculated to help the money market
while subjected to the pressure of the crop i
movement combined with the augmented de- i
mands arising from the activity of business. |
Increased Interest is shown in the condition j
of Western banks and in the question of how
far they can provide the money needed to har
vest and move the crops without any large
demands on New York lor existence, the mat- i
ter being emphasized by the fact that con
siderable amounts of money from other cities
are said to have been loaned in New York this
week The further decline in exchange referred
to elsewhere and the probability of gold imports ;
as soon as the autumnal grain movement be- .
gins was an additional reason for the increased
Indifference with which Wall street regarded ;
the question of higher money rates as an ob
stacle to a further exhibition of bullish specu
lation. Consequently the firmness of time '
money, which has been held at 4%@5 per cent, j
had decidedly less Influence, though In con- i
servative quarters the necessity of caution is j
urged in view of the high prices for securities
and the probability that money will command j
permanently better rates. London was hardly j
a 'tor In this market except so far as the â 
action of Its money market influenced the finan- :
cial situation here. The foreign transaction?
in our stocks were about equally divided be- â¢
tween buying and selling and amounted to lit- |
tie. Activity on the part of the commission I
houses was restricted, indicating that the pub- j
lie's share In speculation is rather unimportant, !
though toward the end of the week there ap- .
peared to be some renewed buying from that j
source. Pool operations in some of the leading I
stocks and speciajties furnished occasion, how
ever, for nearly all the activity the market ex
hibited, and In most cases where efforts were :
put forth to advance a stock a following of
buying orders was secured. In spite of its
strong undertone, the market has been some- !
what spasmodic and Irregular, and In the bond I
department the combined effects of dullness and I
higher rates for money produced some conces- i
sions, particularly among bonds bearing a low !
rate of interest, but which sell at a high I
figure. !

, _ ______ - - ,
NEW YORK, Aug. 11.â Bradstreet's to-mor- .
row will say:
Crop reports and Drobabilities have consti- j
tuted an Important contribution to general ! I
trade and business advices this week. Among j '
the unquestionably favorable features have
been the reports regarding the corn crop, Gov- I
eminent estimates pointing to a yield of prob
ably 2,200,000,000 bushels, a heavy increase over '
last year, and almost within touch of the rec- ,
ord of the total of 1896. Spring wheat indica
tions apparently bear out earlier trade advices
In showing a decrease in condition during July.
The reduction of 25,000,006 bushels in the prob
able outcome estimated, however, considerably- |
smaller it Is true than last year, but with the
exception of 1898 and IS9I, the heaviest re- | â 
corded.
The iron and steel situation is particularly i i
interesting at present, though not specially [ :
active at Eastern markets. Western advices j i
are of heavy demand, scarce supplies of ma- * !
terlals, high prices and increasing volume of |
business booked for next year. The production | ;
of pifriron was the largest ever known, but in j
Mote of this stocks showed a decrease, and l '
current lotion is easily at the rate of i
14.000.000 tons a year. The annual railroad car I ;
famine is apparently at hand, reports of In- |
sufficient transportation facilities being par- )
ticularly prominent In the coke and coal Indus- j ;
tries. Hides, leather, boots and shoes are sym- ;
pathetically strong, and at a convention of shoe j
manufacturers at Philadelphia this week a' i
practical agreement to advance prices of the ,
finished product was reached. Wool is firm on
steady manufacturing demand, particularly for '
the finer grades of domestic, and advices from j
the manufacturing industry are generally fa- j
vorable. Lumber ls firm, as is also sugar, for !
which an unprecedented demand Is looked for > \
in the current season. The outlook in the : '
canned goods trade generally is reported a very '
good one. â  .'-. --.;â¢â 
Business failures for the week in the United
States number IBS, as compared with 156 last ! ;
week. 157 a year ago. and 214 In 1897. In Canada ;
failures number 27, against 26 last week, 33 a
year ago and 37 In 1897.

Dun's Review of Trade.
$ -*>
NEW YORK, Aug. 11.â R. G. Dun & Co.'s j
weekly review of trade will say to-morrow:
After great expansion business hesitates. This i
year it is astonishing that hesitation has been I
so slight. In one branch after another buying '
has halted, only to be followed by larger buy- j
ing.- The output of iron furnaces .In blast
August 1 was 269,032 tons weekly, or 6.8 per cent I
more than in 1892 and 2.7 per cent more than
last year. With a decrease of 27.367 tons In un- |
sold stocks, nearly half In charcoal Iron, the !
apparent consumption and exports did not ex- |
ceed 1.120,744 tons, which barely equals the low- j
est report of production on August, 1, and other !
furnaces have started since that date, with |
several more to follow. The supply appears to j
be at least equal to the demand, although |
new demands for the week have covered 2100 j
tons for new buildings at Chicago, with much |
for bridges and 4000 tons for buildings at Pitts
burg. In bars loth Eastern and Western mills
are unable to take orders offered, nor In plates i
can they take all orders anywhere', while in I
sheets the Western mills are overcrowded,
though the Eastern demand Is lighter. ( The j
Connellsville coke output is again 192,556 : tons
for the week, with .only 530 ovens Idle, and j
prices are unchanged. Tin, following London,
has risen to 32c, but fell to 31.85 c. and copper
ls hard to get at IS%o for lake. Lead Ik quoted I
at $4 50@4 60. Sole leather has slightly ad
vanced with buff and split, but the convention !
of boot and shoe makers proposes to advance j
prices, though without definite authority. New j
orders arc now In some lines larger than the i
works can accept, though In many outers more !
moderate and not exceeding half the output. >
Chicago reports hides slightly lower for pack- '
ers, but a shade higher for country buff and i
heavy cows.
Wool is a little less after Its great rise and ,
Inside quotations are sometimes accepted, but I
sales at the three chief markets have been
20,200,690 pounds in two weeks, against 23.495,
--800 In the same weeks of 1..97, and 16,436,000
pounds In the same weeks of 1892. __
-Wheat receipts at the West have been 8,632.580 >.
bushels In two weeks, against 5,643,960 bushels I
last year, making it hard to believe' the un
favorable crop estimates which still come for- |
ward from unofficial and official sources. The 1
exports have slackened, amounting to only
6,269,183 bushels, flour included, from Atlantic i
ports, against 5,945,311 bushels last year, and
from Pacific ports, 400,020 bushels, against 920.
--155 last. year, other exports being 64S.SS0 bush- j
els. '-â :â *. '
Contradictory stories about foreign crops
weigh but little compared with the actual buy
ing of grain and movement from the farm
ers. The truth seems to be that the supply ot
wheat In the spring wheat region Is larger
than anybody has supposed. â¢
Failures for the week have been 136 in the
United States, against 196 last year, and 29
in Canada, against IS last year.

Chicago Grain Market.
Â« : â , â â <_> !
CHICAGO, Aug. 11.â Wheat started at an ad
vance of %<g%c for September, opening trades
In that option being made at 69%@69%c. Bull
news for the first time In weeks was plentiful.
But all else was lost sight of in the Government
figures on the condition of spring wheat. They
showed a decline of 8.1 points in the condi
tion, suggesting a crop of 235.000000 bushels..
This would Indicate a decrease of 60.000,000
bushels, a shortage too great to be overlooked
even in the; present apathetic, condition of
trading. Too add to the strength of the situa
| tion reports from the Northwest told of
! serious and widespread damage done by yes
! terday's hailstorm in the Dakotas and Min
nesota, and Northwest receipts showed a
marked falling off. Cables, however, were
j rather disappointing, Liverpool showing but
%o%d advance early and losing even the
! slight advantage before the market closed for
i the day. The opening advance was looked
upon by a majority of the older traders as
j sufficient, considering the news, and consid
! erable selling forward, under which Septem
! ber slowly declined to 69%. Offerings were all
! absorbed so quickly, in fact, that although a
i period of dullness followed the decline to
i 69%. some of the early sellers attempted to
| cover shortly after noon. Then It developed
i that the market was heavily oversold. Offer
i ings were scarce. In the next half hour the
buying developed into a regular scramble
! among shorts to cover, and the rapidity with
| which prices shot up caught many heavily.
Before the demand had been satisfied Septem
ber had advanced to 71%. Realizing sent It
I down to 70%'ij70%. The market closed strong
I at 70%. '_
! Corn was weak early on the Government re
' port, which Indicated an - exceptionally, large
I crop. The big advance in wheat caused a
'. rally In corn. September closed % higher.
Oats were exceptionally dull but firm, but
; prices following narrowly t..e course of wheat.
I September closed a shade higher.
Provisions early were slow and rather easy,
j small declines taKing 'place during the morn
ing trading. Hog prices were lower and pack
ing interests were sellers. The market turned
firm In the afternoon with the advance In
wheat, and tinder good general buying the de
clines were recovered and small advances
scored. There was a good ' demand for lard,
but cash business was as a rule slow. At the
close September pork was 2^@sc lower, lard
7%c lower and ribs 5c lower.

WHEATâ The market took an upward turn
! yesterday, both on and off call.
The advance was due to an Improvement at
Chicago, as there was nothing in foreign ad
vices to warrant a rise.
The Chicago market opened dull, but with
more disposition to buy. A better Inquiry for
shipment prevailed, but the bears made a
stubborn fight against the advance. The whole
crowd was short, and there was a general rush
to cover when quotations started up. The de
struction of 73.000 acres in South Dakota by
hail was a factor, and the Government report
was also bullish, suggesting a spring yield of
231,000,000 bushels, against 256,000,000 in July.
The total spring and winter yield was set at
500,000.000 bushels. The Corn crop was estimated
at 2,001,500,000 bushels, a record breaker.

Deciduous and Citrus Fruits.
The canners are paying the following prices:

clings: Bartiett Pears, in this city, $25030 per
ton for No. 1 and $10020 for No. 2; Green and
Yellow Plums, $15020 per ton; Colored Plums,
$10Â©15.
The market Is stuffed with fruit. The over
stock is so great that the docks are glutted and
the steamers have to wait for room before un
loading. Prices for all kinds are low in conse
quence. Peaches, Plums and Pears are the
principal sufferers, though all kinds are af
fected. Purple Figs are almost unsalable.
Owing to the scarcity of cans some of the in
terior canneries are reselling their fruit to
driers, being unable to handle it. The city can
neries, too, are unable to take all the fruit
offered.
Melons are weak and dull, owing to the cool,
cloudy weather.

UNREPEALED
Startling Find of a Big
Blunder.

THOUSANDS OF MINING LOCA

An Omission in a Repealing Act
Leaves the Statute in Full Force,
With Possible Dire Con
sequences.
The California miners and prospectors
have been dealt a severe and surprising
Mow by the discovery of one of the most
remarkable blunders ever committed In
the course of legislation In this State.
The last Legislature undertook to re
peal the State mining law of 1897, regu
lating the location of mining claims and
ever since the approval of the supposed
repealing act, March 20, 1599, the miners
and mining lawyers of the entire State
have assumed that the law was repealed
and that the location of mining claims
in this State had been wholly relegated
to the Federal mining law and to sup
pi. n â  ntary rules and regulations of local
mining districts where such were organ
ized.
All mining locations made since March
2'i last have been made with this under
standing and probably In no case has the ;
law of 1897 been observed. There has been
remarkable and unprecedented activity in ,
prospecting the mineral regions this year i
and the number of mining locations made j
since March 20 reaches into the thou
sands. A good many of these locations
cover rich discoveries, that are veritable
"strikes." and have already developed j
much value. Many have been sold or ;
bonded. Some have been sold for thou
sands of dollars.
Now it is discovered, according to cmi- I

The repealing act as it was passed by
the last Legislature appears In the stat
utes as follows:
CHATTER CXIII.
An art to repeal "An art prescribing the
manner of locating mining olaims upon the
public domain of the United States, recording:
notices of location thereof, amending defective
locations, and providing for the deposit of dis
trist record? with County Recorders, and pre
scribin*. the effect to be given to recordation of
notices of location and affidavits," approved
March 27. 1.97.
The people of the State of California, repre
sented In Senate and Assembly, do enact as
Section Iâ An act to repeal "An act prescrib
ing the manner of locating mining claims upon
the public domain of the United States, record-
Ing notices if location there. amending de- I
fective locations, and providing for the deposit |
of district records with County Recorders, ami
prescribing the effect to he given to recordation
of notices of location and affidavits." approved
March 27, Wi, is herein- repealed.
Sec. 2 -This, act shall take effect Immediately.
The title of the act is all right, but a
moment's consideration of the construe- â¢
tlon of section : reveals the error. The
trouble can be quickly understood by
omitting the matter In quotation marks
and reading: "An act to repeal .an act, !
etc.) approved March 27 1897, is hereby j
repealed." This accomplishes nothing, lt
repeals "an act to repeal," and there was
no such act to be repealed. If the first
line had read, "An act entitled 'An act, !
etc. * * *' is hereby repealed," the '-nd
sought would have been accomplished, i
The mistake is said to be primarily
chargeable to the Assembly Committee on I
Mines and Mining, of which ex-Congress
man A. Camtnettl of Amador, a mining |
lawyer of much legislative experience, I
was chairman.
It is remarkable that the blunder was
not .served by any legal sharp In either
house or by the legal sharp who roved !
the bill as Governor, or until this time by
any of the mining lawyers and mining
men so much interested in the measure. i
Th* State law had required location
> tlces of special form among other !
rinjrs. and when it was understood to be
pealed the old forms became necessary.
here was much" doubt about proper
forms; and the executive committee if the !
California Miners' Association decided to i
prepare and recommend one. Secretary !
E. H. Benjamin requested A. H. Ricketts,
the well-known mining attorney, chair
man of the mineral lands committee of !
the association, to prepare a form to Ije I
issued free by the association. During i
his consequent close scrutiny of the law !
Mr. Ricketts made the discovery. Secre- I
tary Benjamin has this week discussed I
it with other eminent authorities on mm- I
ing law. including Curtis H. Lindley and
John M. Wright; and they all gave the I
opinion that the law of 189" had not been i
repealed.
Mr. Ricketts has thoroughly Investigat- I
ed the legal situation and believes that j
there is no question about the "State
mining law" having remained continuous
ly in effect since Its approval, March ''7 '
1597. , * . '
"There is no ambiguity in the 'repeal
log act,' " lie said yesterday, "and noth
ing on which the . court could hang a I
ruction in accordance with the e\i- '
dent Intent expressed in the title. The |
language is plain and can express but '
fine ..-ailing. It says plainly, 'an an to '
repeal, etc., Is repealed." The title of an j
act may be resorted to only in connection
with some ambiguity in the art and can
not control the plain intent as expressed
in the act itself. The language of the act !
being definite and precise there Is no j
room or construction and the court can- !
not under the rules of the construction i
of statutes go outside of It and under pre- j
text of construction cure a supposed blun
der of the Legislature In attempting to
repeal a statute never passed. The Su- j
preme Court has held, in Harpendlng vs. I
Halght (39 Cal.. l*-l*>, that the motive of I
a Legislature is not for judicial inquiry.
Section lN r >S of the Code of Civil Procedure '
denies *. court power to supply omissions
In a statute. j
"In my opinion no location made since
March 20, 1899. otherwise than according
to the law of 897 is a valid one. Every
claim holder should quickly relocate his j
claim according to that law. Any such
claim is open to location by any one.- It |
would not 1 (-gaily be tresspass for any onÂ« !
to relocate part or all of such a claim â¢
according to the State law, though possi
bly It must be done peaceably. The courts
would undoubtedly maintain possession
by the first one who complied with the
law. It will work great hardships and
wrongs undoubtedly, but such appear? to
me to be the legal situation."
If Mr. Ricketts and other mining law
yers are correct the situation will in
truth be frightful. When claim-jumping
is possible there are always claim-jump
ers and often shotguns around. Hundreds
of prospectors who have claims and
hones will be In sad predicaments. Titles
-will he uncertain and all sorts of compli
cations will arise if the State law has
in fact risen from the dead to plague
the hills and the roaming searchers for
gold and copper, oil and other varied
riches hidden hi their veins and beds
The Federal mining law is of rather
skeleton form, prescribing but brief re
quirements regarding locating and- hold
ing mineral claims, and allows and con
templates supplementary laws by the
Stat, and also by local mining districts.
Regarding locations it says:
The miners of each mining: district may make
regulations not In conflict with the laws of the
United States or with the laws of the State or
Territory Is which the district La situated gov
erning the location, manner of recording,
amount of work necessary to hold possession of
a mining claim, subject to the following re
quirements: The location must be distinctly
marked on the ground, so that its boundaries
can be readily traced. All records of mining
claims hereafter made shall contain the name
or names of the locators, the date of the loca
tions, and such a description of the claim or
claims located by reference to some natural ob
ject or permanent monument as will identify
the claim. -. -' : J
It requires $300 worth of work on a
quartz claim within the calendar/year fol
lowing the one In which the Ideation is
filed, and $20 worth on a placer claim.
T'ntfl ISP? this State never passed a law
adding to the Federal requirements. lo
cations were governed by the Federal law
and the rules of mining districts, of which
there 'were 'many, each with a recorder,
with whom notices were filed. Under the
Federal law a prospector could locate and
hold as many claims as he chose, with
from one to two years to do his assess
ment work. â  .:â¢ .
The State law of 1897 required particular
marks and boundaries; a preliminary no- I
tice giving certain information; its filing
with the County Recorder; $50 worth of |
work in sixty days on a quarts claim; the
posting and 'filing of a second notice, and
so on. It practically abolished mining dis- j
tricts by requiring notices to be tiled with
the County Recorder, and it required all
district recorders to turn their records
over to the County Recorder. The require
ment of $T>o worth of work In sixty days
made it imposisble for the average pros
pector to hold more than one or two
claims. In many ways It was offensive to
prospectors, and there was a general de
man. for its repeal. If It is still in effect
no record in any of the reorganized min
ing districts is valid. Many district rec
ords have been illegally returned to dis
tricts. In few cases has the requirement
of $60 worth of work in sixty days been
observed. Proper notices have not been
posted and recorded In proper time. A
prospector who has staked out a dozen
claims, even if he properly relocates all,
can hold only as many as he can put $50
worth of work on in sixty days. There
are many such complications that will j
arise.
Section 6 of the unrepealed law says:
"All locations of quarts or placer forma
tions or deposits after made which
do not conform to the requirements ot
this act, In so far as the same are re
spectively applicable thereto, shall be

Bitter Fought Legal Battle That Will

Decisions.
A jury in an Alameda County Su

verdict in a damage suit that will
prove far reaching in its effect. It
was a verdict awarding Rasmus Lar
sen $1500 damages against the West-
I crn Fuse and Explosive Company for
I the wrecking of his little home at

by a murderous Chinese.
The suit is the first of its kind ever
tried in this State, and its appeal to
the Supreme Court, which naturally
I follows, will give rise to a line of new
decisions.
Thirty-two similar suits are to be
filed within a few days, and no doubt
these will be followed by others in
other sections where powder works'
! explosions have created havoc and
I left wrecked homes and corpses in
their wake.
It can easily be estimated that the
Larsen judgment will prompt others
in litigations involving hundreds of
thousands of dollars damages.
Oakland office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, Aug. 11.
The trial of the suit of Rasmus Larsen
' against the Western Fuse and Explosives
' Company for $1500 damages on account of
j the wrecking of his home at Melrose by
I an explosion was concluded In Judge Og
; den's court this afternoon, and the jury,
j after deliberating less than twenty min
i utes, brought in a verdict awarding to
! plaintiff the amount of damages sued for.
, Seldom has a case been so bitterly
i fought in the Superior Court of this
i county as the present one, and through
j out the trial, which occupied nearly three
â ' days, the courtroom was thronged with
j residents and pronerty owners who had
j also sustained damages or. in some In-
I stances, total loss of their homes by rea-
I son of the fatal explosion of the fuse
j works at Melrose on July 19 of last year. j
The circumstances of the explosion.
I which cost the lives of five deputy Sheriffs
and constables and one woman, briefly re
; capitulated, are these: A Chinese named 1
' Ah I'ing. after having murdered one of his
i countrymen in Alameda and escaping
I from the clutches of the officers, took ref
| uge In the powder magazine of the fuse
: works at Melrose. Efforts had been made
1 to induce him to surrender, but he scoffed ]
' all. Finally the next morning a desperate
! effort was made to capture him, when he
I tired his revolver in the magazine. An !
1 explosion followed, with the attending fa- j
i tality mentioned and wrecking most of the
; homes and a schoolhouse located near the
| works. . _ , n __ !
It developed that the company had 0000
; pounds Of powder stored in the magazine
j at the time of the explosion, and this, to
â¢ gether with most of the material all. ga
| llons In Larsen's complaint, was admitted
by the answer and amendment of defend
! ant corporation.
But little testimony was taken at the
i trial, and plaintiff's attorneys, Messrs.
j Nusbaumer, Reed, Chapman and Cllft,
' moved for judgment on the pleadings; but
I this the court denied, and the question at
I issue resolved itself into one of fact and
I law as to whether the storing of powder
j at the works in a populated place con
j stituted a nuisance.
' To many remarks made by the court in
i giving his view and definition of a nui-
I sance the defense excepted; also to the
i denial of its motion to instruct the jury
to find for the defense. Exceptions were
taken even In Instances where the court
was addressing Itself to Interrogatories
I of counsel for the plaintiff.
' Judge Ogden in summing up the case
i declared that there were practically no
decisions In this State for him to follow
In determining the issues In the present
case and until there might be some he
would follow along the line of the case In
the with New Yora reports. Nor did that
case bear materially on the issue at stake
In the Larsen suit. .v ._.;..
In his Instructions to the jury Judge
! Ogden ruled that any magazine that is so
located where an explosion will result In
damage to residents or their property
â  constituted a nuisance, even though the
; explosion was caused by an agent other
than the corporation owning the works.
The point raised by Attorneys Lukens &
Wright that Larsen had taken up nis
'â  residence at Melrose knowing the fact
of the powder being stored in the maga
zine, the court Instructed the Jury was of
no weight. â¢ : .'' T ,--..-.:'-
In conclusion the court instructed that
if the jury finds that the corporation had
i stored powder at their works In Melrose
in such a manner that an explosion. would
cause damages to the residents and ti.eir
homes, they must find for the plaintiff.
Two forms of verdict were given to the
I jury. One finding for the defendant; the
' other for the plaintiff in the sum of $1500.
; To the latter form the defense objected
I and was overruled and excepted. . ;
When the jury brought In Its verdict
i finding for the plaintiff, the defense being
. doubtful as to the majority, asked that
the jurors be polled. It proved that the
verdict bad been unanimous.
It is recognized that the ease will now
j go to the Supreme Court as a clear test
case. . .. Â, â  'â y_'' : -J i
In the meantime suits will no doubt
be brought by the other victims of the
plosion, including the trustees of the
Melrose school district. The judgment in
the Larsen case to-day is regarded as a
great victory for the sufferers by the
Melrose explosion. . >

HOW MOSE MADE
A NEW SERGEANT
OAKLAND. Aug. 11.â Mose Allhach if the most self-sacrificing man in
town. He is in jail now, but need not have been there only that he
was loyal to Policeman McKinley's aspirations.
Mose is always In Jail when he is not out, and he is not out more
than three days In any one week. He contracted the habit of getting
drunk and disturbing the peace of Police Officer McKinley's beat. The officer
with the prominent name has in fact made a star record for arrests owing
almost entirely to Moss's shortcomings.
Mose was in court this morning and pleaded guilty. The following con
versation between him and Judge Smith took place:
"What did you get drunk for this time, Mose?" asked the Judge.
"I wasn't drunk, your Honor."
"Then why did you plead guilty?"
"Well, you see. Judge, it was this way: Officer McKinley. my friend,
arrested me, and so I pleaded guilty. If I hadn't pleaded guilty and had
proved that I was sober It would have been a reflection on Mr. McKinley."
"But what about yourself?" said Judge Smith.
"Well, 1 wasn't thinking of myself, Judge. You see Mr. McKinley had
aspirations. He wanted to be a police sergeant. He has made a record
arresting me and I am proud of it for his sake. Since I was arrested the
last time I hear that Mayor Snow and Mr. Dow, both fine gentlemen, hay
made him a police sergeant. I guess I was drunk, your Honorâ guilty."
And Sergeant McKinley, shining in all the splendor of his new decora
tions, walked out of court wondering whether he were Indebted more to
poor old Mose than to the two "fine gentlemen" for his new stripes.
THERE WHS NO
PRIZEFIGHT, SO
SAY "DE GANG"
Jakey Avers No Blow
Was Struck.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
SOS Broadway, Aug. 11.
There was no prizefight at Oakland last
week. There is not a basement under
Fred Gatter's shaving parlor. Fred Gat
ter does not have a shaving parlor. There
is no such person as Fred Gatter on
Broadway. There is no Broadway. There
Is no Oakland.
According to the testimony of some of
the principals and some of the alleged
spectators the above conclusions are
facts.
Gradually the list of those present is
decreasing. Yesterday two were dis
charged with honor in the Police Court;
to-day two more were dropped from the
roll, having satisfied the Prosecuting At
torney that they were not at any prize
fight.
Jakev Baumgarten declares that when
he goes into court the following will be
his defense: "1 was at no prlzenght. The
colored boy and me went Into the ring,
which wasn't a ring, but merely an open
space. He wanted half the money, and
I wouldn't let him have it. so he went
out of the ring, and when the fellows
laughed at him he came back and I said
he could have part of it, and so he put
up his hands. 1 put up mine and the
colored boy lay down. 1 didn't even hit
him. He perhaps thought my fist was
leading for his stomach, but before it
got there the kid was lying flat, and that
is all the' prizefight there was. Every
body says I squealed on them, but 1
haven't. I have got a job now in a can
nery and don't intend to fight any more.
If they don't appreciate me in Oakland
1 can go to some other place. This ain't
the only place on earth. 1 have got It In
for some of those fellows that are down
on me, and I'll make them suffer before
1 get through." â¢/.- â¢.-..-â¢.
Chief Hodgins has in his possession
facts given him voluntarily that tell a
very different story of Jakey's doings.
Should the Chief make public all he was
told by Jake, the would-be boxer would
not have a friend left In town. The In
formation will ' probably be produced in
court, as Jakey gave it all voluntarily
and without any threat or hope of reward
being held out to him. ...
All this time the little colored fellow,
Musa Bryam, is in Jail, no one feeling
enough interest in him to put up a bond.
Yet Musa has been more loyal to his
friends and admirers than his rival, who
is out on bonds. No attorney runs after
the little boy from Zanzibar, and, Indeed,
Musa does not seem to care. He said
to-day he was having a good time, and
that if Chief Hodgins would make a few
changes in the prison diet the jail would
not be half a bad place in which to pass
the summer vacation. Each day Musa's
friend, Will Hennessy. clerk of the Police
Court, sends him a bag of choice dough
nuts.
CHINA AND TRADE
OF PACIFIC COAST
Ex-Congressman F. X. Schoonmaker
Says Now Is the Time to Develop
Oriental Commerce.
OAKLAND, Aug. 11.â Ex-Congressman
F. X. Schoonmaker addressed the Board
of Trade and a large audience at Ham
ilton Hall to-night on the future com
mercial relations of the United States and
China. He made the argument that the
Chinese must, on account of the depre
ciation in the nutrition of their rice, de
pend entirely on wheat and flour, and
these staples must come from the Pacilic
Coast.
After referring to the development ot
Chinese wisdom and genius during the
2500 years that have elapsed since Con
fucius, the speaker argued that they ire
now in a position where they could assist
in working out the commercial develop
ment of this coast. Mr. Schoonmaker has
met I.! Hung Chang and many others
prominent in the government of Peking,
and he repeated many conversations In*
has had with them regarding trade rela
tions with this country.
The lecturer summed up his argument
by referring to the Philippines as the nat
ural base, from which the United States
can watch the operations of the European
vultures who are attempting to divide
China and at the same time develop the
great commercial era that Is now dawn
ing. Next Friday evening Mr. Schoon
maker will deliver another lecture" along
the same lines.

IV.ORMON SMITH WILL
FIGHT WIFE'S DIVORCE
CAME ALL THE WAY FBOM
WISCONSIN TO DO SO.
He Will Insist That the Child Is
Taken From the Custody and
Control of the Mother-
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
'.â¢OS Broadway, Aug. 11.
Norman H. Smith arrived in Oakland
to-night from Lake Mills, Wis., for the
sole purpose of fighting the divorce suit
I brought recently by his wife, Minnie
i Smith, whose adventures with A. Arling
j ton, the bunkoer of widows, has been ex-
I ploited in The Call heretofore. He was
! accompanied by his brother, A. J. Smith,
of Sioux City, lowa. Mr. Smith promises
to conduct a bitter and interesting fight
against his wife's suit.
"Yes, I have come Lake Mills, Wis. -a
pretty good distanceâ to fight the divorce
suit. Moreover, 1 have brought with mc
two very interesting witnesses who will
prove Important at the trial. I have al
ways done all 1 could for my wife, but
It's all up now. I am not going to make
any particular fight over the custody of
the child for myself, but 1 shall insist
that the child be taken from her control
and custody and placed with some proper
I and fit person.
"Last February I withdrew my suit
against her for a divorce upon the prom
ise that She would lead a better life, and
at that time 1 agreed, too. that she should
have the custody of the child. I told her
she could go to any city she saw fit, and
as long as she behaved I should send
her a check each month. --.--Â» ' "
"Suddenly one day she disappeared and
I heard no more of her until the sum
mons in her present divorce suit was
served on me. Then I also received a
copy of The Call opening my eyes as to
her adventures with this bunko man Ar
lington, whom In my cross complaint I
1 name as co-respondent."
THE DIVINITY SCHOOL
REMOVAL POSTPONED
Pacific Theological Seminary Unable
to Dispose of Its Oakland
Property. *
BERKELEY, Aug. ll.âThe failure of
the trustees of the Pacific Theological

sible and the freshman class will be

These are a few of the more Important
schemes and their originators that are
now interesting the city officials. They
are making lots of work for some of the
departments. To-day the City Clerk of
fice was busy preparing resolutions au
thorizing the City Attorney and City En
gineer to report to the Council the neces
sary proceedings for the opening of West
street. Councilman Glrard and Professoi
Rising of the State University went to
San Leandro with proper demijohns to
obtain some samples of water from the
wells at Roberts Landing, which the pro
fessor will analyze. _
This morning the Board of Works reaa
Mr. Mott's resolution relating to the es
tablishment of wharves In West Oakland
and referred to the committee of the
whole. The City Engineer is engage.!
with the Street Superintendent procuring
data concerning salt-water sprinkling
plants. Every other city official ls In
some way -interested in one or more of
the many schemes now on the boards.
It Is very evident that there is more
work in hand than can be successfully
carried out by any one Council, especially
when it is necessary for said Council to
pass half an hour at a regular meeting
debating whether or not tne Poundman
shall be required to refund a fee for im
pounding a cow. These weighty matters
require time and deliberation and involve
millions of dollars. Each one of them
would be a distinct Improvement to the
city, and lf not now will sobn be a neces
sity. But It will be necessary to take
them up seriatum. v - _â¢ .
"Nearly one-quarter of our term of ol
fice has expired." said a Councilman who
has not a scheme to-day, "and we have
done nothing. That is to say, we have
done nothing very big. We reduced em
ployes' salaries tor a couple of month*
and raised them again; we appointed a
City Wharfinger, and had the City Hall
steps painted. We have talked about
Prince Poniatowskl and his Blue Lake
water drealns; we bought two old non
histone cannon at a fancy figure and have
turned them back to their owner; we have
quarreled considerably with the Board of
Works; we have not done anything for
the annexed district; most of us nave
had our vacation; we have all drawn our
salaries regularly. But somehow or other
It seems to me that eleven of us with
the Mayor might have done a little more.
I almost forgot to mention tile fact that
we attempted to move the corporation
yard and thus save $10 a month, but
failed. But at the same time we have
authorized expenditures for this month
which I understand are about double
those authorized during this month of
last year, and we were to be so econonil
cal, too." - - -
The Mayor's message, which was out
lined in The Call a week ago. will be pie
sented to the Council next Monday night
and may throw some light on a few of
the measures now under discussion.

council accepting delegates representing
the newspaper carriers. A delegation from
the three morning newspapers was pres
ent with credentials for admittance to the
body, and the committee on organization
reported in favor of admitting them: but
as the question involved many new Issues

of invested capital Into an organization,
representing organized labor, a long and.
tiresome debate ensued.
The question was eventually postponed
for one week by a vote of 14 to 13. which

pretty evenly divided on the question of
admittance.

NEWS OF THE REALITY WORLD
A slight revival of activity in real es- t
tate circles during the past week is taken |
to indicate that the usual lethargy that i
settles upon the community during the j
vacation period is beginning to be shaken |
off and that brokers are resuming their |
normal wideawake attitudes. A number j
of sales were made during the week which j
while taken individually do not amount to
much, collectively indicate a decided- im
provement in the tone of the market.
The most important transaction of the j
week was probably the bid of $67,500 re- i
ceived by Yon Rhein & Co. from D. L. j
Randolph for the property at the corner j
of Post and Stockton streets, belonging ;
to the estate of the late Dr. James Simp- |
son. The bid was made at an auction |
sale on Thursday, but the sale will not j
be consummated until it has been con
firmed by the court. The property has a
frontage of eighty feet on Post street, '
with a depth of 46:8 on Stockton, and in
cludes a three-story and' two-story build
ings.

ard, lot 45:10x137:6. The terms are private, i
but in conjunction with recent purchases .
of Mr. Bothinin the same district will
aggregate fully $50,000. Another good j
sized sale of property in this district was
made by Thomas Magee & Co., $13,375

BISHOP GAINES TALKS
OF TRUE EDUCATION
BETHEL A. M. E. CHURCH
CROWDED.
The Prelate Utters Gems of Wisdom
Amid Rapt Attention â Morn
ing Session.
Bishop Wesley John Games delivered
his annual lecture last, night at the Bethel
African Methodist -Episcopal Church, cor
ner of Powell and Jackson streets, before
the thirty-second annual conference of
the Afro-American Methodist Episcopal
Church. The Bishop's lecture was an un
usual treat and the church was crowded
with interested listeners. He spoke on
the subject of Christian education, and
during the course of his lecture Bishop
Games uttered many gems of wisdom and
thought. 7;-*-"-
In part he said: "The education of our
young men should be one of the first
duties of the true Christian. They should
be taught to love and honor their God,
for all education that leaves God and the
Bible out of Its curriculum is wrong.
Christian education is a powerful agency
of good. It is a priceless gem which
lights our path through life. A young
man is like a growing plant. If a plant
is not nourished it dies. So with a young
man. If he is not properly educated all
the good in him is liable to wither. In
order that he be made a strong, fearless,
God-loving man he should be given spir
itual nourishment. Let our young be
given the food of truth. A godless edu
cation takes from our sons a cherished
hope and leaves them nothing. They
have nothing for them to lean on when
they appear before the Almighty on judg
ment day. When you crowd out the
Holy Spirit you ruin your church and
you ruin your young man."
The morning session of the conference
was devoted to the transaction of routine
business. It was called to order by Bishop
Games. Rev. J. F. Anderson of Colusa
led the devotional exercises. The after
noon session was devoted to the Mission
ary Society. Addresses were made by
Rev. D. R. Jones, Rev. J. Edwards and
Rev. K. N. Hardiman.

CIiEVEB. CONFIDENCE WOMAN. j
Jennie Howard, Alias Puroell, Ar
rested on a Charge of Petty.
Larceny. . - %'.
, Mrs. Jennie Howard, alias Purcell, has
been sought after by the police for the
past three months, as she was wanted for
swindling women out of small sums of
: money by means of bogus money orders.
I She was seen on Devlsadero street yester-
I day afternoon by Mrs. Katie Bulck, one
: of her. victims, and was handed over to
the custody of a policeman, who took her j
Ito the City Prison, where a charge of
j petty larceny was booked against her.
Jennie came from Australia some j
] months ago with her husband and he went i
; to Alaska, leaving her to make a living !
' the best way she could. She had a little |
' dog named "Patsey," and together they !
, wandered around to different rooming !
; houses seeking to engage a room, j
. and getting a loan of a small sum of
[ money upon an application for a money I
i order, which she said had been sent her â 
I from Alaska by her husband. Among her i
i victims was Mrs. Annie Leroy. 501 Ver- ;
j mont street; Mrs. Matilda Moffatt,' 1512
j York street, and Mrs. John Mocker. 1130
! Church street, besides a number of others, i
Jennie's plea was that she was a stew
! ardess on one of the Australian steamers
and was willing to. pay. liberally for a
j room for a month or two, as she intended
i taking a rest. . .

THOUSANDS GATHER TO WELCOME THE ARIONS,
WHO JOIN HANDS WITH THEIR WESTERN BROTHERS
GREAT was the preparation for the
reception to the Eastern Arions
who arrived last night on the be
lated northern overland and great
was the disappointment resulting
from their late arrival. Eight o'clock
â¢was the scheduled hour for their en
trance into San Francisco. II was full
three hours after when the vanguard of
cabs and carriages rolled into the 1 ai
sle court tell the assembled multitude
that the visitors had at last arrived.
Very early in the evening the German
population of San Francisco beg to
move toward the Palace Hot* - At 9
o'clock the court was lined with people,
all nrescnt to give a joyous and hearty
welcome to the German singers who
crossed the continent to grasp the hands
of their Western brethren in amity and
friendship. The three local German sing
ing societies were assembled early in the
evening and they took up their stand in
the upstairs waiting-room of the ferry to
â¢-ing a song of welcome to the arriving
Arions. The great majority of the Ger
man people did not go to the ferry but
sought the best vantage ground possible
In the spacious court of the Palace Ho
tel- . . , ,
First It was *â¢: for the time of arrival and
the assembled crowd began to grow impa
tient as the hands of the clock moved on
ward Then a rumor spread through the
pack of humanity that the train was de
layed an hour. Nine o'clock came and
yet the visitors did not put in an ap
pearance. Another hour passed and still
another, when at last a wild shout broke
the impatience and stillness of the throng,
for the German singers had arrived.
One hack after another rolled into the
court and many tired and travel-stained
tourists, happy to have reached their des
tination, jumped out and dashed into the
office. The women were bonneted alike
and the men wore hats of uniform char
acter. Dress suits were piled high one
above the other and for a brief quarter
of an hour the life of tne hotel clerk
was unadulterated misery. Order was
straightened out of chaotic confusion and
rooms assign, d to all.
The lateness of the hour forbade any
ordered celebr; tion or reception. All that
could be done under â â¢â¢ f ' circumstances
was to improvise a chorus and sing a
welcome to the Eastern Arions. This was
done With a will. The strong, lusty Teu
tonic voices poured out the strains of
national welcome sonp and all those who
waited and waited were recompensed for^
their trial of patience. Great applause
followed and another typical German
song was rendered by the full combined
local societies. After a general hand
shaking the crowd dispersed and the visi
tors retired to their rooms to prepare for
the week of celebration that will begin
with the rising sun to-day.
At the ferry a similar scene greeted
the Arions of the metropolis. As they
landed from the boat the march was
through the upstairs waiting-room. Hard
ly had the first men passed off the boat
when the great swelling chorus was taken
up by the local contingent and Boon for
tified by the visitors, all of whom, women
as well as men. Joined together to roll
out in powerful and musical tones the
great national songs of tho Fatherland.

by an accident to the engine at Yolo and
it was nearly two hours late when it
reached Benicia.
The train consisted of five sleepers, two
dining cars and the commissary car. lt
was in the latter department that the re
ception committee met their guests^ and
bade them welcome to the Golden State.
The formal greeting was between Dr.
Magnus, representing the Sun Francisco
Arions, and President Weinacht of the
New Yorkers. The Californians and tno
Easterners met as though they had been
life-long acquaintances, although but few
of them had had the pleasure of knowing
each other personally. Members of the
reception committee did not stop tit a
handshake, but caressed the visitors and
even imprinted kisses on the cheeks of
the New Yorkers.
"We have heard much of a Callfornian's
style of receiving his guest," said Presi
dent Weinacht, "but in all our travels,
which have extended over both conti
nents, we have never received such a wel
come ts this. We feel already as though
we had been intimately acquainted with
the San Francisco Arions all our lives
and that California was as much our
home as it ls theirs."
Songs of the fatherland followed the
greeting, and then the commissary car
rang with the toasts freely offered and
given as- the Arions of the East and tne
West drank to each other's health.
After these preliminaries the reception
committee was ushered through the train
and made acquainted with every person
on board. Including "Herman," who pre
sided over the commissary car, and the
special trainbands and porters, who have
traveled with the party since it left the
Empire City. By the time the train ar
rived at Oakland pier joy was unconfincd
and the visitors had reached a full ap
preciation of the nature of Californian
hospitality. Every one of the excursion
ists wore the emblem of the San Fran
cisco club, and every member of the re
ception committee had been decorated
with the little silver badge of the New
Yorkers.
There were 132 persons in the party, and
of this number twenty-two are members
of the singing section, which has made
the New York Arion Verein famous the
world over. There are a number of
wealthy and distinguished New Yorkers
in the party. President Weinacht is a
member of the firm of Max Ams & Co.. a
big wholesale firm. John Rachy is a wine
importer. W. J. Amend is a wholesale
druggist. John Reisenweber ls the pro
prietor of one of the largest breweries in
New York. Herr H. H. yon Mellenthln,
the official reporter of the excursionists,
is the editor of the New York Staats Zeit
ung. The proportion of ladies in the party
is large.
The visitors state that this is one of the
most pleasant of the club's annual excur
sions, and that nowhere have they been
treated better or more heartily welcomed
than they have been since they reached
the shores of the Pacific.
"This is God's own country." said Pres
ident Weinacht. "I have heard much of
California, but had no idea it was such a
paradise. Even what little of the scenery
we have had an opportunity to observe
convinces me that there is no place on the
continent that can equal it. I am very
much afraid that some of our members
will become so Infatuated with the Pacific
Coast that they will not want, to go back
with us. I know that some of them have
come here with the intention of making
investments if they received a good im
pression of the country-."

special mention. It is an ornament to the
church and its clear, mellow and power

usual quality; i\ The organist, Harry W.
Brown, well understands its merits, and
with his -fine musical ability is enabled

of the mass.
In the evening Steams' "Solemn Ves

THE GRANDEST PLACE
ON THE CONTINENT
JOHN* REISENWEBER, one of the most influential and prominent mem
bers of the Arion party, made the following statement to a Call repre
sentative:
"I have heard a great deal about the wild and woolly West, but It is
wild and woolly West, no more with us. The Arions have never
had such a pleasant trip as this one. I was much impressed with the
scenery through the Upper Sacramento Valley and if there is more like it in
the State all that 1 can say is that It is the grandest place on the continent.
It is a disappointment to us not to be able to reach San -Francisco by day
light. Our excursion came through on schedule time until .we commenced to
travel over the lines of the Southern Pacific Company, and then we were
subjected to many petty delays, but lost time was happily made up until the
unfortunate breakdown of this evening, which made an unfortunate ending
to our journey across the continent.
"We anticipate the grandest time of our lives during our stay in San
Francisco. If the gentlemen who . have come to welcome us are a fair sample
of the Californian I must say that they are the most â  hospitable and open
hearted people I have ever met. Our party will carry back to their Eastern
homes the most pleasant recollections of their visit to the Pacific".

ROBBED HIS WIFE
TO PLUNGE ON
HORSE RACING
Young Robert Carter
in Trouble.
A peculiar case of misplaced domestic ;
trust came to light yesterday when a !
warrant was sworn out by Mrs. Jennie
XV. Hearne, wile of a prominent Alaska ,
miner, for the arrest of her son-in-law.
Robert A. Carter, on a charge of grand
larceny. The party who will be defend- ,
ant in the case is charged with having
pawned $3000 worth of jewelry, the prop- '
erty of his wife and her mother, on the
pretense that he would immediately re
deem and return it, and of having skipped
to the East without having fulfilled his
promise.
Another feature in the case is the
youthfulness of Carter and his wife. The
latter was a Miss Lillian Hearne and she
met and loved Carter in New York about
two years ago while she was 17 years of
age At the time of her marriage her
husband was nearly 20. The couple came
to California witn the Hearne family and
stopped at the St. Nicholas Hotel in this
city. . _ j
Young Carter Soon became fascinated
with the sport of horse racing. He
plunged and often lost heavily. His
mother was the proprietress of a. fash
ionable boarding-house in Brooklyn and
upon the death of one of his relatives he
inherited considerable money and some
stock. Of the latter he turned over one
thousand dollars', worth to his wife. He
had no occupation and his money swiftly
sped over the counters of the poolboxes.
realizing for. him but small returns. In
time it was all gone and he began to look
elsewhere for coin with which to pla>
