BOER INVADERS
ARE CLOSING IN
ON LADYSMITH
Attacking Army Has Mounted
Two Big Guns Within Range
of the British Camp,
Defenders Hourly Expecting an Assault
That Will Begin the Decisive Battle of
the War in Upper Natal.
LADYSMITH, Oct. 28. 7p. m.â The Boers are gradually clos
ing around Ladysmith. They have mounted two big guns on
Tinta Ingoni, 4500 yards from the British camp. An attack
is expected.
DURBAN. Oct. 28 (Delayed in transmission). â The Natal
Mercury has the following from Ladysmith:
"The Boers have been seen dragging heavy artillery up
Tinta ingoni. It is expected they will adopt tactics similar to
those they pursued at Dundeeâ demonstrating in one direction
while attacking in another.
'The British intelligence department is completely informed
regarding the Boer plans. The enemy have planted two guns,
said to be those used in sheiling Dundee, on a kopje, two and a
half miles away, in the direction of Elands Laagte."
LONDON, Oct. 30.â The Daily Mail publishes the following
dispatch from Pietermaritzburg, dated Sunday:
"Patrols from Ladysmith report that there are four large
Boer camps within a radius of ten miles, extending in a semi
circle northeast of the town. Evidently the enemy is concen
trating all his forces. Commandant General Joubert is in su
preme command. One Boer laager has a Red Cross tent care
fully posted in a conspicuous position.
"The British had several skirmishes with the enemy to-day.
Railway communication with Ladysmith is still intact. At Co
lenzo a couple of Basutos were arrested for putting bowlders
on the railway. They confessed they had done this by order of
the Transvaal authorities.
"A war balloon* very small and so light that two men can
hold and haul it down with a wire strand, and which can as
cend 30C0 feet, is now in use. and the full position of the Boer
guns has been ascertained.
"The heavy and incessant rains have flooded Tugela River,
which will prove an effectual barrier to any Boers proceeding
southward. The railroad bridges are strongly guarded."

but ultimately the (runners got the range
and soon sent a number of shells Into the
town. Comparatively little damage was
done. A convent which had been con
verted Into a hospital was the chief suf
ferer, three of the shells striking the
building. The ammunition used by the
Boers was apparently of an Inferior qual
ity. There were no casualties. The Brit
ish returned only one shot, which, being
well directed, disabled one of the enemy's
guns.
"After three hours the Boers sent an
envoy to ask if the town was prepared to
surrender. Colonel Baden-Powell replied
in the negative, but the shelling of the
town was not resumed."
A later dispatch from Mafeking dated
October 24 says:
"The Boers are in possession of the wa
ter works and have cut off the supply.
This occasions no anxiety, because ample
supplies are available In tanks and well*.
"During a sortie this evening the Brit
ish encountered the enemy three miles off

been warned and returned our lire in ear

As our men had no intention of pressing
an attack they retired immediately.

SAN FRAISi CISCO. MONDAY, OCTOBER 30, 1899.
DESPERATION DRIVES PHELAN'S POLITICAL
ORGAN TO A FIGHT OF PERSONALITIES
HON. HORACE DAVIS IN EVERYDAY LIFE.
T T GRACE DAVIS is making a splendid campaign. Multitudes of people assemble to hear
J~jL him speak. He is a clean, honorable, outspoken man and conducts the campaign in a manly,
clean and creditable fashion. He does not stoop to slander his opponent, but, on the contrary,
treats Mayor Phclan with distinguished consideration. Democrats are not assailed as traitors, but
are persuaded by honest arguments to support the Republican party and contribute to tlie progress
and prosperity of San Francisco.
In this campaign the Republican press has not indulged in personalities or resorted to cari
cature. To some extent Mr. Phclan' s personal wishes have been considered in the exclusion of topics
foreign to the contest, but his desire to exclude the discussion of national questions has not been grati
fied. Fair reports of Phclan meetings are published in the Republican nezvspapers. Detectives have
not been employed b\ the Republican press to shadow the footsteps of Mayor Phelan to ascertain
Tvhcre he goes and with whom he consorts. Yet the "wilted morning glory of the Democratic press is
very much concerned regarding the appointments that Horace Davis prefers to keep.
Mr. Davis has nothing to conceal. His life is an open book. He is not obliged to obscure any
of its pages to maintain the respect of his fellow men. He is willing to meet on terms of perfect
political equality ci'cry Republican in San Francisco. No one is excluded or proscribed. When he is
elected Mayor he will be the Mayor of all the peopl-e, and men in every station of life will receive
from him just and considerate treatment. All the political signs indicate his election. Nothing testi
fies more readily to his grozving strength than the desperation of his opponents.
Martin Kelly, an ex-boss, no better and no worse than the bosses with whom Mayor Phelan
every day consults, desired to speak personally to Horace Davis and present the grievances of his
friends in the Twenty-eighth District. Mr. Davis employed no go-betzvecn, but met the ex-boss face to
face, man fashion, and here follozvs Horace Davis' statement to the people as to what took place:
I have been repeatedly informed by leading Republicans that Martin Kelly desired an in
terview with me. Believing that no man in the Republican party should be denied a hearing,
and believing all the elements of the party should be harmonized, I met him last Saturday
afternoon, with other gentlemen of the party, and a consultation ensued regarding the cam
paign. Mr. Kelly complained that a fence had been built around the party organization that
shut out him and his friends. He made no proposition and asked no favors, and I made no
promises or pledges of patronage or position, and told him I would make none. The conference
was held at 3 o'clock in the afternoon and lasted an hour, at the expiration of which Mr. Kelly
left, and the consultation continued for some time afterward.
squadrons of the Eighteenth Hussars
with a Maxim, accompanied by the
Dublin Fusileers and a detachment of
mounted infantry. Colonel Moeller com
manding, kept under cover of a ridge
north of the camp and a< 6:30 p. m. moved
down toward Sandsprult.
"On reaching the open this force was
shelled by the enemy, but without casual
ties. Colonel Moeller led his men round
Talana Hill, in a southeasterly direction,
across Vanf.a Drift road, captured several
Boers and saw the Boer ambulances retlr-
ing. Then, with Squadron B of the Hus
sars, the Maxim and the mounted infan
try, he crossed the Dundee-Vryheid Rail
way and approached a strong force of the
enemy, whn opened a hot fire, wounding
Lieutenant Laehlan.
"The cavalry retreated across Vants
Drift, the Boers pressing. Colonel Muel
ler held the ridge for some time, but the
enemy enveloping his right, he fell bark
across the spruit. The Maxim stuck in a
water hole. Lieutenant Cape was wound
ed, three of the detachment were killed
and the horses of Major (Ireville and Cap
tain Pollock were shot under them.
"The force finally re-formed on a ridge
to the north, which was held for some
time. While Captain Hardy was attend
ing Lieutenant Crum, who had been
wounded, Colonel Moeller's force retired
into a defile, apparently Intending to re
turn to camp around Impati Mountain,
but it was not seen afterward."
OFFICIAL ACCOUNT
OF YULE'S RETREAT
CAPE TOWN, Oct. 29.â The following
official data is made public regarding the
fighting: nenr Dundee:
The Boer losses durins Friday's engage
ment at Talana Hill are estimated at 500
in killed and wounded.
Saturday the divisional staff was recon
stituted. The country was clear of tne
enemy eastward, but as big forces were
reported closing in on Dundee from the
north and west, it was considered ad%'i.;
ahle to move the British forces across the
railway to a new position south of the
camp. During the afternoon the infantry
moved out and began intrenching a new
position. All available transportation
was used to carry soldiers.
At 4 o'clock in the afternoon the enemy
opened fire on the intrenchments and
camp from the shoulder of Impati Moun
tain with two six-inch guns, getting a
fairly accurate aim over a range of 700
yards. The soft ground rendered the per
cussion fuses useless. In spite of the fall
ing shells the wagons were loaded with
stores. Lieutenant Hannah and an ar
tillery sergeant were killed.
During the night of October 22 a fresh
Fosltlon was occupied, about 7300 yards
rom the enemy's guns. News was re
ceived at 8 o'clock Monday morning of
the victory at Elands Laagte. and a di
vision was moved toward Glencoe Junc
tion for the purpose of cutting off the re
treating enemy, should they use Glencoe
Pass. Two fugitives were captured.
We moved our guns down the ridge to
the west of Impati Mountain and our ar
tillery exchanged shots with the enemy,
who brought six-inch guns to bear on the
transports. Rain and mist coming on, it
was deemed advisable to concentrate on
the positions occupied that morning. The
movement was completed at noon, the
British troops having marched ten miles.
The column was en route for Ladysmith
at 11 o'clock that night, passing through
Dundee into the Helpmakaar road wiih
out attracting the attention of the Boers.
Major Wickharn of the Indian commis
sariat service joined the column with
rlfty-three wagons from the old camp.
Moving eastward through Blesbok Pass,
Belth was reached, and here the column
rested, after which the night march was
resumed and AVaschbank River reached
the following morning at 9 o'clock.
At 11 o'clock two batteries, two squad

MODUS VIVENDI
GIVES CANADA
NEW TERRITORY
Boundary Agreement Loses
the Porcupine Placer Fields
to the United States.
England Gains Possession of a Rich Dis
trict to Which She Did Not Even Lay
Claim in Previous Contentions.
BY HAL HOFFMAN.
yUNEAU, Alaska, Oct. 24 (via Seattle, Oct. 29).â The modus
vivendi, as agreed upon by Canada and the United States, as
stated in press dispatches of the 13th inst., if correctly de
scribed therein, cither wilfully or unintentionally misleads the people
of the United States and makes a concession to Canada of a wide
extent of valuable mineral territory â including the Porcupine placer
mines. The line of delineation has officially and in general for
years been understood to be at a point on the Klahcna River knoivn
all over South-eastern Alaska as Pleasant Camp and for nearly two
years the British Hag has been flying there. The Canadian Gov
ernment has there built expensive barracks and established a com
pany of soldiers, now under command of Captain Jarvis. Pleasant
Camp is about thirty-eight miles from Haines Mission, or Chilkat,
oft Pyramid Harbor, and, by an unofficial survey made by a Juucau
surveyor over a year ago, twenty-seven miles from high tide of
Chilkat Inlet, or three miles distant inside American territory, under
the original agreement fixing the international boundary line ten
marine leagues from the sea, where the coast mountain range ran
back more than that distance from the sea.
Thus, under the modus Vivendi, the boundary line Is moved from Pleasant
Camp, on the Klahena River, a point beyond which the Canadians have never
dared to come and where they "broke out" their flag as the limit of their terri
tory, at least fifteen miles further down to the Indian village of Kluckwan, near
the confluence of the Chilkat and Klahena rivers. On some maps the latter river
is spelled "Tlehinl." This is within ten miles of tidewater.
' So far as is known in Southeastern Alaska the Canadians never claimed
the Porcupine â¢ diggings .or ' any country farther down the Klahena toward the
Chilkat and tidewater. The Canadian barracks are about five miles above
Porcupine City, the placer mines being between Pleasant Camp and the Kluck
wan. >/. , , ,
T *!Â» thÂ« modus vivendi the boundary tine la understood to h*>. though not
permanently, Indefinitely fixed until pueh ; time as the two Governments come
to a final agreement on the subject, which may not be for years. Consequently,
the miners at Porcupine "don't know where they are ; a_t," or rather, where they
may ultimately be, and the situation has seriously disturbed and unsettled min
ing Interests there. â¢â¢ I
The British Columbians have made a clear gain of at least fifteen miles of
territory,- taking in one of the richest placer 'camps in Alaska, which has been
located under American mining laws. These laws give the locator 1500 by 600 feet
on a creek, whereas the British Columbia laws grant only 100 feet, and .from
rim to rim of a creek. It will thus be seen what a damage to original locators
and what a juggling of mining claims would result.
Another serious difficulty arises from the location of the Canadian barracks
and customs post at Kluckwan. The Chilkat is a mighty river. It drains a vast
and rich country. More water comes down it in one season than down both the
Chilkoot and Skaguay rivers in five summers. The head of canoe navigation is
near Boulder Creek, about thirty miles up the Klahena. Kluckwan is one of the
oldest and perhaps the largest Indian village in Alaska. The name itself, In na
tive vernacular, means "mother town." The village possesses a number of two
story frame houses not very elegantly furnished, but which have been built at
considerable expense. They are usually the residences and property of chiefs
and rich men of the tribe. There are a few men among the Chilkats, the most
Intelligent natives in Alaska, who could, if urged by their own ambition, dig
up $5000 and more for a pot latch, and most of this would be in silver dollars.
The Indians will not understand the wholesale and retail levying of a cus
toms duty, and when such duty is sought to be collected upon their merchan
dise and furs and things to trade at Kluckwan by the Canadians upon their na
tive stream, where they have been accustomed to travel of their own free will
from time immemorial, it is thought there will be trouble.

AMERICAN NAVY
Army Could Not Have
Captured Santiago.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON. Oct. 29.â Bureau off
Naval Intelligence has. made., public aj
very interesting document published in â 
the official organ of the Minister of War j
at Madrid and containing the sentence of i
the Supreme Council in the, proceedings j
instituted because of the capitulation of j
Santiago in July of last year. The de
fend ante named In the proceedings are J
Joee Toral Velasquez, general of division j
ami the successor of General Linares in !
command of the Fourth Army Corps of ;
Cuba; General Mesa, chief of the brigade |
of' Guahtahamo; .Lieutenant Colonel Raj
fael Alayri, â¢ commander of Sagua de j
T'anamoJ Captain Artum Hidalgo, com- |
mander of Alto Songo; Cauia.ni Jose I
Rica, commander or ban Luis; Captain
Komualdo Martini â /.. commander of I'alma
boriajio, and Captain Clement* feyro, â 
commander at Xl Cristo. The defendants
named; besides General Total,, are the ;
commanders of the outlying military,
posts which v. . re Included in the capitu
lation of Santiago.
The most interesting feature of the re- ,
port is tho fact that the court lays great |
stress upon Hie importance â i the Aineri- j
can naval forces, and declares hat with- |
out their co-operation it would lave been I
impossible for the American forces to !
have compelled the surrender of Santiago. <
The {sentence of the court concludes ny â¢
vindicating General Toral from any j
censure iur the surrender of the city, j
stating that he had "used every means of
defense' required by the laws of honor j
and duty,' as attested by tho brilliant bat- j
ties sustained â â  in June .2 to the day of !
capitulation; ajid the many casualties in
generals, commanders, ifncers and pri- |
vates during the battles.
The other defendants are exonerated,. â¢
having served .under the instructions of
their commanding general, who in turn j
had the sanction of his home Government !
for each step taken. ;
Before reaching this conclusion, how- i
ever, the court goes Into what may be I
characterized as a brief but eomprelfen- !
slye history of the whole Cuban campaign j
from the Spanish standpoint,, the various |
reverses met with from time to time be- '
ing cited as explanations of the final sur- j
render of the city, which was pointed out ;
as being inevitable from the time tho i
American squadron blockaded the harbor
and cut off all hope of outside assistance, i
It is declared that during the bombard
ment of Santiago on May 31 about 100
shots were Bred by Spanish batteries and ;
in- 1 Colon In a space of forty-five miles.
The tact that the Colon aided the bat
teries of Morro. Socapa and Punta Gorda
during this bombardment Is new. Re- ;
ferring to the sinking of the Merrimac 1 in j
the channel at the mouth of the harbor J
the court declares that she was sunk by !
tho combined fire of the Reina Mercedes
and the -water batteries, a statement not :
in agreement with Lieutenant Hobson's i
view of the affair on board the Merrimac. j
Of the bombardment of the American '
squadron on June 0 the court says that
over 20Â»Hi projectiles were discharged by
the hostile Beet; resulting in serious in- :
Juries to the Reina Mercedes and the gar- â 
rison quarters at the Morro. It says, I
however, that no guns were dismounted j
}iy this bombardment. "One chief was !â 
killed, however, and eight men killed; two j
chiefs, five officers and fifty-six men i
wounded." This is rather a larger cas- I
ualty list than was credited to this bom- i
bardment at the time.
The landing of the American forces at
Daiquiri and the bombardment of that
town and of Sibonej are described In con
siderable cietail. Coming down to the '
tight at Caney. the court declares that i
half of tlie officers engaged were either
killed or wounded. It points out with'
pride, however, that the Spanish artillery
during the morning's fight oft July 1 was
able to silence ahe American battery at ;
El Poso and cause It to withdraw.
Of the general engagement of July l, it
is said that over frX) men and fifty gen
erals and officers were killed and
wounded. It is pointed out that (luring '-
the engagement of July 1 only 1700 men of â â 
the Spanish command we;-.> actively en- ;
gaged, the others, It is explained, b<<injÂ» i
to the westward, occupied in guarding j
threaened positions and unable, to be of,
material assistance.
Following the loss of San Juan and \
Caney; the court declares that the water 'â 
supply was cut off and that the military I
force surviving the two days' fighting at 1
July 1 and July 2 was entirely inadequate I
to Fend the fourteen kilometers of pro- j
tective works around the city. The total
force available is placed officially at 7000
infantry and 1000 guerillas. The re- !
mainder of the forces, It is explained, :
were garrisoning the Morro and the bat
teries at Socapa and Punta Gorda, and |
performing also the services of carrying
water to different points, patrolling the
city, "and rendering such other services
aa the inhabitants could have rendered
had the â¢ Ity remained loyal." :
Referring to garrison stores, the court I
Bays that at the tin. of the surrender. I
all that was left of the arms was 1,000,000
Spanish Mauser cartridges. These would I
not have lasted for more than two attacks J
on the part of the enemy. The Argentine I
Mauser ammunition, of which there was I
a considerable supply, could not be
utilized for want of weapons of that type,
nor cojild the Remington ammunition, j
these weapons being In the hands of the !
Irregular forces only. The provisions in j
the city at the time of the surrender, It
is said, consisted only of rice, salt, oil,
coffee, sugar and brandy, and of these j
only about ten days' supply remained. |
There were over 17"'> sick in the hospitals j
â¢who had to be fed, "to say nothing of the)
soldiers who spent day and night in
trenches, after three years of campaign- â 
Ing, during the last three months of which i
they seldom had meat to eat .' nd were j
often reduced to the rations mentioned j
above." :
Li *rcsp is laid upon the presence
'<i t lie American squadron oft the coast.
and the court declares thr.t besides the
numerical superiority of the enainy on
land with "seventy placet of modern ar
tillery and the support of a powerful
dron," r.o relnforcenienta could reach
Santiago except by Hf-a, and UAh eventu
. am impo from the moniont
when the American ships completely

In addition to the decree of the court
'-h t ins- the defendants, there are two

PORTLAND. Oct. 20 âThe -own of I^a Camas, on the Columbia River,
twenty mfie'fl from Portland, was thrown into a state of excitement last
night about !Â» o'clock by the fatal shooting of a footpad who had waylaid F.
C Tents man, the fecefftlj appointed postmaster. Mr. Yeoman was returning
to his home in the outskirts of the town by a path leading across a vacant
lot when he came upon a rope that had been stretched across, with the evi
dent purpose of tripping him up. As he carried a lantern he discovered the
line In time to avoid it, when he saw a man approaching. He ordered the
fellow to stand back, but was answered by a rock which just grazed his head,
and then Mr. Yeoman fired, shooting the man throug-h the heart. The dead
man proved to be Edward Barthlemy, an employe of the paper mill. He had
armed himself with a revolver and slungshot. the latter made of a handker
chief containing the rock which had missed Mr. Yeoman.
Barthlemy, who was about 30 years of ace. had lived in Clark County for
several years. Although he was always hard up, nothing wrong was known
of him. He had a wife and one child, arid his parents reside on a farm near
I. a Camas Lake, about two miles from town. The body was not disturbed,
but was guarded where it fell in order that his relatives and the officials
should understand from the surroundings that Mr. Yeoman was justified in
the killing.
Public opinion In La Camas commends Mr. Yeoman, and he was not even
been arrested. The Coroner of Clark County was notified and he will prob
ably take possession of the remains to-morrow.
Mr. Yeoman was paid $100 this afternoon, but had deposited the money at
McMaster's store, and at the time of the tragedy had but eighty cents on
his person. The revolver he carried was a portion of the postoffice belong
ings recently turned over to him, and this was the first time he had carried it.

NEW TREATY WITH
SPAIN TO BE FRAMED
Since the War There Has Been No
Agreement Save That Covering
Terms of Peace.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 29.â An under
standing na? been reached by which it is
expected that negotiations will be opened
soon at Madrid for a new treaty between
the United States and Spain. This will
be the last step toward completely restor
ing the friendly realtions between the two
countries. â¢ ":i .'V > \
The war with Spain swept the old treaty
out of existence and the only international
agreement now in existence is trie peace
treaty-, which Is confined to the events
growing out of the war, and had no refer
ence to commerce, navigation, extradition
and other manifold relations between
nations in time of peace. The coming
negotiations will be for the purpose of
forming such a treaty of commerce, unity
and friendship. The present condition is
quite anomalous, as there is no basis on
which persons could be, extradited from
one country to the other, or for the de
termination of any commercial difference
which might arise. Fortunately there has
been no case occasioning serious differ
ence.
Both sides expect that the new treaty
will be a great improvement on the old
one, which was an antiquated document,
dating back to 1795, with many of its pro
visions devoted to the boundary between
Florida, 'her. a possession cf Spain, and
the United States. Save for the Cushing
protocol, it has been impossible to frame
a new treaty satisfactory to both sides.
and It remained for the war to dispose of
it and thus open the way for a modern
treaty.
It had been thought that the Due
d'Arcos would conduct these negotiations
with the State Department here, but the
Minister is rather relieved at the under
standing that the work will be carried On
at Madrid. The United States Minister
there, Bellamy Storrer, will act for the
United States.

Quay will be seated by the United States'
Senate. Senator Quay'fl credentials, given
by the Governor <>f Pennsylvania after

This is the cO&dusion reached, not only
- nator Quays friends, but by those
Hhu have made an impartial canvass of
the situation. A Senator who has had
some correspondence recently with Vice
President Hobart, and who by reason of
his position has a better opportunity at
(earning the Individual views of Sena
tors than any other public man,
said In an interview that Mr. Ho
bart is confident that Mr. Quay will
be seated. 1 n addition to this, it is
stated that B systematic canvass of
Senate has been made in two separate
instances-one foi Senator Quay himself
by designated friends and the other by
Geofge Q. Cannon of L'tah, who has been :
promised the vacant Benatorshlp from
that State by gubernatorial appointment,
provided the Senate votes to seat Quay.
As a result both are believed to be well '
satisfied that they will occupy seats in the ,
!â â¢ \' Senate. The canvass made by Mr. '
Cannon is said to .lave been complete,
with exception of Senator Hanna. He re
fused to commit himself, but as he voted ;
it Corbett, Quay is said not to be ;
worried as to the way he will vote.

SOLICITATION
BY MAIL ILLEGAL
View of Civil Service
Commission.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 29.-A long official
statement reviewing the â¢ legal phase at
the political assessment question, and
holding that the soliciting of campaign
funds by letter comes clearly within the
i remedial provisions of the civil service
! law* was made public by the Civil Service
I Commission to-night. The commission
j made the statement because of circulars
sent out by W. F. Burdell as treasurer
of the finance committee of the Ohio
State Republican Executive Committee,
! soliciting contributions from Federal em
ployes. The commission says the Ohio
circulars bring up clearly the question so
i long awaiting judicial determination, as
;to whether soliciting of contributions
for political purposes by means of letters
i addressed to Federal officers or employes
at their offices constitutes an oftenso
I under the twelfth section of the clMl
i service act. The commission s ruling or
; brief now made public Was submitted by
President Proctor of the commission to
| ex-Senator George F. Edmunds of Ve-r
--i moot, who was chairman of tne Htaie
1 Judiciary Committee at the t' me , tne ,
I civil service act was passed. The latter
! in his opinion, to which the commission
I Rives particular significance, says:
"I entirely agree with the conclusions
Stated in the brief. I think It is clear
that the solicitation of such political
aids by means of the postoffice is dis
tinctly" within the prohibition of section
12 of' the act to which you refer. The
language of the section is 'That no per
son shall, In any room or building, etc.,
! 'solicit in any manner whatever, etc. It
is not that no person being In a room or
building shall solicit, but it is that no
! solicitation shall be made in any such
j place, no matter where the person mak
| Ing the solicitation may be. "

building firm will be launched on Tuesday
wit ii unusual display. Prominent Russian
naval attaches and Government officials

tlie favored one will be either Miss
Caslm, niece of the Russian Embassador,
or Miss Mertnago, daughter of the Rus
sian naval attache.
The new Russian cruiser, the con
st ruction of which was begun In May,
LB9B, will be of a distinctive type and will
( represent the latest development uf the
1 art of naval architecture as applied to
armored seagoing vessels. The builders
in this instance have been called upon
; to solve ihe most difficult problem that
lias confronted them in shipbuilding. The
plans call for a guaranteed speed of 23
! Knots for twelve hours. In order to ac
complish this task she will be provided
with water-tube boilers of the NicfauÃse
type, calculated to develop 26,1)00 Indicated
horsepower. The motive power is to
consist of two vertical inverted triple
; expansion four-cylinder engines, driving
twin screws.
The vessel Is 400 fept long, 52 feet beam,
19 feet 6 inches draught and of 6500 ton.s
â¢ displacement. Her main battery will

SAMOAN CLAIMS.
Progress Made in Negotiations for
the Settlements.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 19.â Some progress
Is being made in the negotiations between
the three Governments, signatory to the
Berlin treaty looking 1 to the settlement of
Samoan claims. Just what the character
of the settlement will be. cannot be stated
at this time, but it can be said with au
thority that the President has no inten
tion of agreeing to any .proposition where
by the united States will contribute an
equal share with Germany and Great Hri
tain to satisfy the" claims. As a matter
of fact, the authorities are of the Opinion
that this Government should not pay ona
cent toward the settlement of the claims.
This opinion is based upon the principle
that while an American ship committed
the damage which created the claims, yet
the cause of her act was the conduct of
German officials In Inciting the natives
to armed resistance.

from his late residence to the ' Pennsyl- ,
vania train that conveyed it to Washing- ,,
ton where interment will be made in Ar

utes. The coffin was partially .covered I
with a silk American flag. .Numerous?
'floral pieces were on the mantels and a :
few on the foot of the coffin. The im- j
mediate family, relatives and most inti
mate friends were present at the house ;
services. â¢ , Â:
The honorary pall-bearers were General <
A S Webb, Major Azel Ames and Major-
Francis H. Mills, of the Loyal Legion;
Colonel Daniel Appleton, Dr. Albert
Shaw, William R. Corwin, Henry Ham
ilton Lewis and Gilbert K. Harroun. The j

I to General Henry, was present and had ;
| charge of the arrangements. While the j
services were being conducted in the
house three National Guard regiments,
the Seventh, Sixty-ninth - and Seventy

The facts of the alleged Boer massacre
at Dundee appears to be that a portion of
the town guard, although fairly warned
by General Yule before his retirement,
continued to carry arms, and thirty of
them were shot before the Boers discov
ered who they wero.
The body of Sir William Symons was
burled without a coffin, shrouded in the.
Union Jack. Among the papers found upon
him was a telegram from Lady Symons
congratulating him upon his success.
Later accounts of the first battle and
the evacuation of Dundee do not give
those affairs a rosy hue. Owing to the
shelling of Glencoe camp the telegraph
operators were compelled to scamper.
"When the Boers entered Dundee they in
dulged in general looting of stores, but
apparently did not otherwise molest the
populace.
In the first battle the Boers captured
the Maxim of the Sixteenth Hussars, but
ciily after the en.tire crew of the gun,
with one exception; had been disabled.
The survivor effectually damaged the
pun. Only two olnoers of the staff of Gen
eral Symons came off without a wound.
Again it is asserted he moment the
Royal Dublin Fuslleers reached the sum
mit of the kopje, at Glencoe, the Boers
Bhowed a white Hag and asked a truce to
bury their dead. The British artillery
â was ordered to cease Bring and the Boers
took advantage of the opportunity to re
treat en masse. Otherwise they would
have been [mated by the British lire.
The special correspondent of the Dally
Mall, at Ladysmlth; telegraphing Sunday,
describes the arrival of the war balloon
there, on Saturday. It was welcomed, he
said, with wild dances by the Kaffirs, who
regard it as a deity. General White and
General Archibald Hunter both ascended
<>n Sunday and reconnottered the enemy's
position.
According to the -latest reports from
O"npe Town General Joubert has Joined
hands with the Free State forces and
there has been some outpost fighting.
President Kruger has arrived at Glencoe.
There is no fresh news from the western
posts. The miners are still working at
Kimberley, where there are provisions
onoucrh to last nine months. Cecil Rhodes
has mounted and fully equipped a guard
of 30u men at a cost of Â£15,000.
A Durban correspondent of the Daily
Mail says: "It is reported on the autbor-
Ity of British residents in Pondoland that
the Pondos are in constant communica
tion with Durban and that they are anx
ious to help."
The Household Guard, it is .announced,
has received orders to form a composite
regiment for South Africa, including the
First Life Guards, Lieutenant Colonel Sir
Lockhart commanding, quartered at
Windsor, and detachments of the Second
Life Guards, Colonel The Earl of Bundon
ald commanding, and the Royal Horse
Guards. Lieutenant Colonel Brocklen
hurst, commanding. Tho medical examin
ation was begun yesterday and it Is ex
pected tho regiment will embark in about
a week.
The Standard voices the general anxiety
regarding Sir George White's position, re
marking the adapabilfty and able strategy
of the Boers, for which they had hitherto
not been given credit. It (joes on to say:
"Their startegy is so well planned that
it is Impossible, to doubt that it is the
product of some officer trained in the best
European school of war."

TRANSVAAL AGENTS ARE
ENLISTING AMERICANS
MINNEAPOLIS, Got. 20.â The Times to
morrow will say: It has been learned
here that agents of the Transvaal Govern
ment axe in Chicago st.-eking to enlist
Americans for service in the ranks of the
Boers. There are In Minneapolis several
ex-members of the Thirteenth Minnesota
who are anxious to go to the Transvaal,
but they believe the Boers must be de
â â â ! and they consider enlistment in
their behalf almost a,s a forlorn hope. Two
'â¢x-nvmbers of the Thirteenth have com
munlrated with the representative 4n
Great Britain in rp^ard to service in the-
Transvaal. The reply was that the only
way in which they could get to South
Africa as soldier? would bo to go to Can
ada and enlist and after that take bis
chances of ever being called into the
African Bervlce.
They have, therefore, dropped the idea
of ioining either the Boer or British
forces. How the ex-^okliers learned of
the presence in Chicago of a Boer agent
they decline to say.

Boers occupy virtually one-fourth of the

have also suffered three reverses and lost
2000 men in killed and wounded. Released

CHINESE POLICY OF
ENGLAND AND AMERICA
NEW YORK, Oct. 29.â The Sun's Lon
don cable says: The Central News says it
learns that there is a definite understand- ,
ing between Great Britain, the United !
States and China regarding the Anglo- 'â 
Saxon policy in the Far East, and that
the Chinese Government has received an
assurance that the British and Americans
will maintain the policy of the open door.
Negotiations affecting details on this
principle are, according to the Central
News, proceeding between Peking, Wash
ington and London.
CHICAGO, Oct. 29.â special to the
Times-Herald from Washington says:
The United States has demanded from the
Governments of Russia, Germany and
France assurances that in their division
of China into zones, of political domina
tion or spheres of influence, the trade
rights of citizens of this country
shall be fully. respected. : These demands
are pretty sure to be acceded to, and as
soon as the necessary correspondence can
be passed with the Washington and the
three European capitals it is not doubted
that the desired assurance will be given
by the Governments named. In fact, a
tacit understanding to this effect already
exists and little remains to be done but to
decide upon the form in which the assur
ances shall be given. There was some lit
tle surprise In diplomatic circles when
the demands of this Government were
presented through trie embassies here, but
no sign of extreme displeasure or of in
tention to resist was manifested in any
quarter. This move for making sure of
trade in China, for assuring ourselves
that all our treaty rights would
be respected under the proposed rear
rangement of actual authority along the
coast of China, was entered upon by the
administration in no light or casual man- !
ncr, but only after full discussion and I
careful consideration of all the possibili
ties. Now that there is practically a cer
tainty of a successful issue it is felt that
a great stroke has been made for Arnerl-I
can trade and inlhience.^^^^^^^^H^HH

SCHLEY TO
TAKE A FLEET
TO AFRICA
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Oct. 29.â The Journal's !
Washington correspondent says: The
South Atlantic squadron has been ordered
âor soon will be orderedâ to the scene of
the South African hostilities. Secretary i
Long so declared to-night. It is the sec- '
ond great development from this coun
try's standopint in the European crisis,
and, strangely enough, follows yester
day's notification by Great Britain of
Germany's proposition for a partition of '
the Samoan group.
The attitude of this country, one of hos
tility to the German proposition and Her
man pretensions as to Samoa, cannot fail j
to be regarded as of the greatest signifi- j
eanee. The European concert, evidently
desirous of getting a practical illustration j
of this country's attitude, is credited I
with having impelled Germany to make
the first test, The result is that the
I'nited States has demonstrated her 1
friendliness to Great Britain, thus veri- j
fying the prediction that the United i
- would maintain the statu quo in '
Sfmoa.
Secretary Long was found at his apart
ments in the Portland.
"Yes," said Secretary Long, in response
to a question, "Rear Admiral Schley will
be ordered to East African waters. The
squadron will be increased to whatever
extent the situation demands. I do not
think, as at present advised, that a larger
squadron than the Chicago, the Montgom
ery and the Wilmington is necessary, but,
as I have said, there may be contingen
cies which would make it advisable to
largely add to these vessels."
Secretary Long denied that Rear Ad-
| miral Schley had made a request for a
I larger squadron. "But," said he, "I pre
| sume any commanding officer going to
the East African coast at this time would
prefer to have a representative squadron."
It is the understanding that if any of
I the larger ships be sent it will be the
Texas. With the Chicago, the Mont
gomery, the Wilmington and the Texas,
fi.ur or five of the smaller cruisers would
I constitute a representative squadron. The
feeling at the. Navy Department that it
would be well to have a large Am>rl<;m
squadron cruising off Kast Africa, is a
growth of the last few days. It is un-
I doubtedly based on the news obtained in
I Washington and from Europe; that con
: tingencles may arise in the process of war
: in th^ Transvaal which would mako the
presence of a larger body of sailors and
marines a necessity in that neighborhood.

Navy's Experiments Be-

Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Oct. 29.â The Navy De
partment will commence at S o'clock to
morrow morning a test of the Marconi
wireless telegraph system. The battle
ship Massachusetts will leave her pres
ent anchorage off the foot of Forty-sec
ond street, North River, at that hour and
will proceed to the lightship near Sandy
Hook.
The test will begin soon after the Mas
sachusetts leaves her anchorage, Signor
Marconi being on the flagship New York,
while one of his assistants will work on
the battleship. Messages will be ex
changed while the Massachusetts is on
her way to the lightship for the purpose
of ascertaining to what extent if any
messages are liable to be influenced by
atmospheric disturbances and other con
ditions that exist in the vicinity of a
large city like New York. The New York
will leave her anchorage off the foot of
West Thirty-fourth street two hours later
than the Massachusetts and will follow
her to the lightship, where the trials will
continue.
Tests between the ships will be made in
communicating with each other at sea
at various distances, while messages will
also be exchanged with Atlantic High
lands. ._^^__________
MRS. STANFORD IS
HOME FROM EUROPE
After a Short Rest in New York She
Will Proceed to Cali

NEW YORK. Oct. 20.â Mrs. T,eland
; Stanford of California is at the Fifth
I Avenue Hotel in the best of health and
â  spirits, having recently arrived from Eu
rope, where she passed several months.
: She will remain here a week longer and
I then go directly to California, where she
will pass the winter. Speaking of the
great Stanford University, the completion
of which absorbs her entire time and at
tention, Mrs. Stanford said:
"Before 1 left California I told my
j architect to consult with Dr. Jordan, the
; president of the university, as to what
, further buildings he needed, and they will
jbe devoted to chemistry and art. The
: plans are now awaiting my approval.
"In the library, which has room for 2a0.
--000 volumes, 1 am about to place three
etained glass windows. The center one ! s
! Hniman Hunt's 'Light of the World.' and
j this motto appears beneath: 'I bring
. peace to this house." The one on the ieft
represents Mosea sitting with his tablets
and writing the commandments, while
. that on the left portrays Thomas a
Kempis with the 'Imitation of Christ' in
I his hands. I am a firm believer In object
teaching.
"The university now has 1400 studentsâ
. 800 jdrls and 900 boys. I have limited the
! number of girls who can attend to 500. as
there was such an influx of them that
; they outnumbered the boys and threat
ened to destroy the identity of the unl
vereity as a masculine seat of Uarning.
; which it should be, since It is in com-
I memoratinn of my sun.
"In all that T have done since my hus
band's death I have closely adhered to
the plans which he gave his approval to,
and I am more than thankful that time
has been given me to finish this work."

TROUBLE IS AGAIN
BREWING IN SAMOA
NEW YORK, Oct. 29.â Interesting news
concerning the political Situation in
Samoa is contained in a letter received
by a gentleman in this city from a friend
at Apia. The letter is dated October 3.
and says in substance that trouble is
brewing "n Samoa, and notwithstanding
the reassuring news of the United States
Consul there it wih come sooner, per
haps, than may be expected. If the
powers do not get to work very soon and
establish a strong Government tuere will
be another invasion of Apia by natives
and more white blood â will be spilled.
Mataafa's party has never foi u\ instant
since the advent of that awful farce, the
peace commission, had the slightest idea
of relinquishing claim to the Government
of Samoa according to the ideas and in
structions of the commission. Rebellion
still exists and is growing slowly day by
day. One of these days it will burst into
a flame again. The German Consul sym
pathizes with the Mataafa party as much
as ever.

ENGLISH TOURIST DIES
OF DELIRIUM TREMENS
SEATTLE, Oct. 29.â Thomas Hughe* a
well-dressed and well-educated i^iiji^,
man, died in a local hospital yesterday nf
delirium trcmcr.s. He came to Seattle
last Thursday from Toronto, en route to
Vancouver. To passengers on the train
he said he was a solicitor In London,
England, having witnessed the yacht race
in New York. He was touring the West
for pleasure. Just before the train
reached Seattle he jumped from his berth,
shouting, "They are trying to kill me."
He was taken in charge and on the ar
rival of the train here removed to '.he
hospital. In his delirium Hughes raved
very much about the Columbia-Shamrock
yacht races, and once or twice he made
the assertion that he came over with Sir
Thomas Lipton to witness the race.
Nothing found upon Hughes' person in
any way established his identity, except
a hotel bill receipted by John Holderness
of the Albion Hotel in Toronto. The at
â  -riding physicians say alcoholism caused
death. â

MORE SPOTTED MARKETS.
TRADE â  showed some change last
The mi i rts of feverish
tivity everywhere were varied by the state
â¢ thru the retail and distributive trade had fallen
ilities, accompanied by impaired collec
at various points. The general business of the
country at large, however, suffered no depreciation,
gain in bank clearings, which was
35 2 per cent over 1808 and 57.3 per cent over 1892,
the year preceding the panic. The falling off in indi
vidual se - ascribed to the unseasonable hot
weather, which always affects trade, and not to any
:i in merchandise. Indeed, conditions rather
a continuation of the current wonderful activity
than otherwise. The money market is decidedly
r, stocks have lately shown an improvement,
very large purchases of provisions and ammunition by
the British Government have swelled the balance due
the United States from abroad, while the transactions
in iron and steel are the heaviest ever known so early
in the season, amounting to 1,500,000 tons for next
year's delivery, or two-thirds the combined capacity of
the works. In addition the railway earnings are
â¢ted immense, and largely over those in October.
In fact, the eastbound traffic from Chicago during the
pasi month has been double that of the same month
last year. And when it is seen that prices keep up
all along the line there is no reason to believe that the
slight falling off in the movement of merchandise here
and there is due to anything else than the unseasonable
warm weather.
The great staples stand about the same as last week.
While iron and steel are still at high pressure, the
minor metals, such as tin, lead and copper, are weak,
with increased offerings. Cotton is off a fraction, as
the views of European buyers are below those of
American sellers. Cotton goods, however, are excep
tionally strong, and woolen goods are in active
demand, with a further advance predicted. Wool itself
is again active, large sales being reported at firm
prices. Hides and leather are stiff in sympathy with
the recent advances in boots and shoes, while lumber,
after a brief halt, due to larger stocks, is again firm.
Coffee has ruled firm, with some revival of the spec
ulative demand. The failures for the week were 100,
against 226 for the same week in 1898.
Conditions on this coast continue brilliant. Ail
classes of trade are active and prosperous, and tho.-,e
merchants who handle farm produce have been doing
a large business for months. The export demand for
all sorts of commodities, both on foreign and Govern
ment account, was never better than it is to-day, the
only drawback being a continued scarcity of cars.
Even hay and beans, for months dull and cheap, are
now advancing, with an enormous Eastern demand
for the latter, and heavy orders for the former on
Hawaiian account. Provisions, live stock, hides, wool,
dried and canned fruits, wine, oils, leather â in fact,
almost everything that California produces â are more
active than for years, and, what is still better, at
unusually high prices. The early rains have greatly
enhanced the general confidence in the future, and
credits are accordingly easy, while there arc no com
plaints of collections from any quarter. Failures are
few and small as a rule, for when business is as brisk
as at present it is an easy matter to meet liabilities.
The prediction made early in the year that 1809 would
be the banner year for California is being abundantly
realized.
How much is an Examiner opinion worth? For
instance, during the great international yacht races,
while that paper was being scooped every day by The
Call with its Marconi bulletins, the Examiner said
wireless telegraphy was a fake. Last Saturday, in an
article on its fifth page describing the experiments of
a naval board with the Marconi system, it printed the
following: "There is no use denying the fact that
wireless telegraphy is an unqualified success." Why
â¢ did it deny it, then?

PHELAN'S RUBBER-NECKING.
DESPERATE indeed must be the feelings of the
leaders in the Phelan camp, when in the hope
of finding out something which will serve them
I for campaign material they set detectives to follow
the Hon. Horace Davis and report to the Phelan
organs at what time Mr. Davis comes down town,
â â  what he wears, where he lunches or dines, with whom
he talks and what he may happen to carry in his hand.
Neither Mr. Davis, nor his friends, nor the Repub
! lican party, have anything to fear from the disclosures
' which may be made by this system of rubber-necking
: on the part of the Phelan managers and organs. Hor
ace Davis does not lead a double life. His actions,
private and public, are those of an upright man.
i I'helan's detectives need not resort to any elaborate
system of spying to find out what Mr. Davis does by
â  day or by night. He is not a hypocrite and has no
| hidden course of life. By open inquiries they can find
out all about him; at what hour he begins his work,
where he goes during the day, with whom he does
business, with whom he has conversations, at what
hour he goes home and where he sleeps at night.
The only objection of Republicans to the Phelan
; rubber-necking is one that is shared by decent men of
! all parties. The introduction of personalities into the
j campaign is liable to degrade it from the high plane
i on which politics should be conducted to the level oi
j that kind of vilification in which spies and sneaks
j delight. The Republican party has endeavored to
j keep the contest as clean as its own candidates are.
i Knowing that the men on its ticket are above
reproach, it has been willing to concede a personal
respectability to the other side. Until yesterday it
; appeared the campaign might be carried through to
the end without anything of a base nature to disturb
the judgment of the voters upon the issues at stake,
and honorable Democrats as well as Republicans will
regret the vile tactics which in their desperation
Phelan and his organs have adopted.
Since the spy system ha 3 been instituted it will
probably be continued until the close of the contest.
The detectives will report to their bosses what Mr.
Davis does and says, whether he carries an umbrella
and whether he wears overshoes on rainy days. Ir
i- mean work, but doubtless for the spies it pays well.
It will not pay Phelan, however, for the voters of the
city can be relied upon to express at the polls their
condemnation of that way of doing politics.
Mayor Phelan seems to be somewhat premature in
using the patronage lash to make traitors of Repub
licans. He should at lenst wait until the votes of San
Franciscans give him the power to distribute political
loaves and fishes before he threatens to inaugurate a
Phelanite administration under the cloak of non
partisanship.
General Fitzhugh Lee. who was detained in quar
antine upon his arrival at New York, says he can find
no reason for his detention except that the officers
wanted to take his temperature. The general prob
ably thought he looked as hot as he felt during the
operations of the health officials.
THE EXTRA SESSION SCHEME.
REPORTS of the intention of the Governor to
call an extra session of the Legislature come
from every side and increase in reliability as well
jas in number. Nor is there lacking authority and
evidence to confirm them. It is therefore clear the
scheme is one of the issues of the time the people have
j to face, and it becomes the duty of the press as the
representative of public opinion to speak out upon
the project and by exposing the injury it will inflict
upon the taxpayers and the true interests of the State
prevent its accomplishment if possible.
There is nothing in the condition of the time to
justify the cost of the purposed extra session. Such
reasons for calling one as have been invented by the
promoters of the plan have been flimsy and futile.
It was asserted at one time that a decision of the
court on the Vrooman act had rendered it impossible
for cities to undertake any kind of street work until
the act was amended. The falseness of that pretension
was promptly exposed. If there be any lack of street
work in any city in California it is because the city
lacks the money or the enterprise needed to carry it
on. There is nothing in the law to prevent it.
Equally absurd is the claim that legislation is
necessary to enable the State to carry on the work of
river improvements. It is true that by reason of con
fusion in the acts of the last Legislature the courts
have decided that the office of Commissioner of Public
Works no longer exists, but that does not prevent
the river work nor the auditing of the expenses of
carrying it on. In short, no reason yet advanced for
an extra session is sufficiently valid to amount even
to a presentable excuse for holding one.
On the other hand the objections are many and
strong. The State is now in a flourishing condition.
' Business is brisk and all prospects are bright. There
i- an abundance of work in city and country. Work
â  ingmen find no difficulty in obtaining employment at
good wages. The early rains have been abundant for
the season, and there is every assurance the winter
will bring us enough not only to make the crop of
the coming year, but to fill to fullness the natural
reservoirs which were depleted by the long drought.
The fruit and other crops of this year ha.ye been good
and have brought good prices. An abundant stream
of revenue has poured into the State, and from one
1 end of it to the other there has been a revival of
i enterprise and of energy which can be counted on
! to bring about great benefits to all classes of people.
Why should all these bright prospects be disturbed
and the attention of the people distracted from busi
ness by an unnecessary legislative session this winter?
There is nothing the Legislature can do to increase
business or to promote the public welfare. The session
! will entail a large expenditure of money which must
be made up by the taxpayers. Money which might be
employed in making needed improvements will thus
be turned over to politicians, and the tax levies will
have to be higher.
The only object Gage can have in putting the State
to the expense of the extra session is that of pro
i moting the scheme of electing Dan Burns or some
; other railroad tool to the United States Senate. It is
' a schemer's game from first to last, and rests upon
false pretenses.
SOUTHERN PACIFIC TACTICS.
BY way of showing its malice against William R.
Wheeler, who has been recommended to the
President by the Pacific Coast Jobbers' and
Manufacturers' Association for appointment to the
vacancy on the Interstate Commerce Commission, the
Southern Pacific Company has set its evening organ
to the task of reviling him. That task the organ
undertook to fulfill on Saturday by ignoring the asso
ciation and the business men of the entire coast and
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, OCTOBER 30, 1899.
â  referring to Mr. Wheeler as a candidate whom The
I Call has "trotted out." Furthermore, in reference to
I The Call's exposure of the railroad scheme, it added:
. "The man of straw created by The Call has hayseed in
i his hair and exudes heads of wheat at every pore."
Such is the sum and substance, the wit and the
worth of the Southern Pacific argument against Mr.
Wheeler. That is the best and the worst its evening
organ can do in the way of reviling him and belittling
the forces of the coast that support him. Mr. Wheeler
is the candidate of The Call only because he is ths
candidate of the business men oi California, of Oregon
i and of Washington. The Call supports him because
! he stands as the chosen candidate of representative
I men of the Pacific Coast and because he is in every
way by natural ability and by experience well fitted
to perform the duties of the office. Having been so
nominated and so recommended, and having every
qualification for the position, he merits the support
of all who have Pacific Coast interests at heart and
| who desire harmony of action among our people.
Mr. Wheeler has been indorsed by Chambers of
! Commerce, Boards of Trade, Merchants' Associations
I and by individuals of eminence in business affairs in
all parts of the coast from Puget Sound to San Diego.
The only opposition to him is that made by the
' Southern Pacific. That is the only discordant element
; on the coast, the only voice that roars in protests
! and revilings against the general movement to procure
I a Pacific Coast representative on the Interstate Com
; merce Commission.
There may be wit, there may be satire, in the refer
ence to a "hayseed" and in saying "he exudes wheat
heads at every pore," but such shafts can never be
leveled at the Southern Pacific Company. It has
grown no hay in California, nor produced any wheat.
It has done what it could to ruin the hay-grower and
the wheat-grower. It has never shown a regard for
the property of hay and wheat producers further than
to cast upon it the eyes of avarice and to lay upon it
the hands of greed; and it is but natural its organs
should show no respect for the character of that olass
of the industrious people of the State. The so-called
"hayseeds," however, have on more than one occasion
shown the Southern Pacific they are not men of straw,
and now it is the turn of the business men of the
cities of the coast to give the domineering monopoly
another lesson of the same kind.
The curse of a malignant distemper seems to be
upon the Southern Pacific whenever Pacific Coast
interests are at issue. The moment anything is pro
posed to advance the welfare of the coast the Ken
tucky corporation opposes it, even though that cor
poration would itself be benefited. In the present
movement, were the railroad managers capable of
taking a clear view of the situation, they would per
ceive it is to their advantage to promote the trade of
the coast, for that trade must furnish them with freight
for transportation. The blindness of an utter malig
nancy, however, is upon them all. They oppose the
candidate of the coast without why or wherefore, and
in opposing him resort to such falsehoods as saying
The Call "trotted him out,'' and to such futile
mockery as references to men with hayseed in their
hair exuding wheat heads at every pore. It is a poor
argument and a mean wit. but it shows the animus
of the Southern Pacific Company.
The saffron hide of the yellow journals is at last
tingling to the existence of wireless telegraphy. The
experiments now being made with the Marconi system
by the United States Government are of such world
wide importance that the yellow sheets are forced to
report them and in doing so acknowledge tardily the
wonderful triumph of The Call in reporting the inter
national yacht races.
Even nature seems to have entered the conspiracy
to encourage the expansion policy of the United
States. The Rio Grande River has overflowed,
straightened out its bends and thrown considerable
valuable Mexican territory into the United States.
WHEN it became evident last winter that the
election of Dan Burns to the United States
Senate could not be forced through the Legis
lature by the railroad the managers of the Kentucky
corporation determined to save the prestige of the
company at any cost. It was given out accordingly
thnt Burns was not the candidate of the railroad but
the candidate of Herrin, and therefore it was Herrin
who was repudiated and not Huntington.
Now that the widespread support given to Mr.
Wheeler for the oflice of Interstate Commerce Com
missioner renders it certain the railroad candidate for
< the office will have no advocates among the business
I men of either California, Oregon or Washington, it
once more becomes necessary to do something to save
the prestige of the road. This time it is Stubbs who
is put up for the sacrifice. It is announced that
Chipman is not the candidate of the railroad but the
candidate of Stubbs.
During the conference between the committee of
the Pacific Coast Manufacturers' and Jobbers' Asso
ciation and the managers of the Southern Pacific
Company, Stubbs was put up to make his little speech,
and he is reported to have said frankly: "Chipman
is my candidate, not the candidate of the Southern
Pacific Company." The language is almost identical
with that of Herrin declaring: "Burns is my candidate
and Mr. Huntington had nothing to do with the
matter."
By close investigation it might be possible to dis
cover some difference between a Stubbs candidate and
a railroad candidate. It would not be a difference,
however, of any importance. A Stubbs candidate who
| by any chance was not a railroad candidate would very
soon be pulled down by order of Huntington, and
Stubbs would do the pulling. \\ r e give the correction
as a part of the lighter news of the day and for what
it is worth. If it be of any advantage to Mr. Chip
man to be known as Stubbs' candidate rather than the
railroad candidate, we are willing he should have the
! benefit of it.

Rabbi Myers Considers the Home Study Plan Well Chosen
and of Wide Interest.
San Francisco, Oct. 10.
The Editor of The Call â Dear Sir:
I have no hesitancy in saying that
the idea of imparting useful
knowledge through the medium of
the daily press will become more
and more popular and will be high
ly prized by the masses as well as
by the classes. The subjects
enumerated in the prospectus of
the Home Study Circle are well
chosen and calculated to prove of
considerable interest.
I should like to see the curriculum of study
enriched by the addition of some of the
sciences treated in a popular style, c. g. ,
astronomy, botany, and more especially physi
ology and hygiene. Perhaps the Sunday Call
may take charge of these. I wish the Circle
every success.

The Japanese torpedo-boat destroyers
built by Yarrow and Thorneycroft are
giving satisfactory results on their trials.
The Sazanami, built by Yarrow, averaged
31.352 knots over the measured mile, and
the Kageron, a Thorneycroft boat, aver
aged 30.24 knots during a three hours' trial
at sea.
A serious accident occurred on board
the British battle-ship Prince George on
October 6. A boat was being hoisted out
by means of the large steam derrick,
when the arm of the derrick broke, pre
cipitating the boat to the deck an.l in
juring seven bluejackets. One of the
sailors lost a leg and the others were
more or less hurt.
Quite a number of steam trials came oft
last month of British war vessels, more
or less satisfactory. The battle-ship
Canopus had a trial of eight hours under
full power, giving 13.763 horsepower, an
excess of 263 horsepower, but the speedâ
18.5 knotsâ fell short one-quarter knot of
the calculations. Of the 3u-knot torpedo
boat destroyers the Spiteful made 29.9
knots and the Cheerful 20.102 knots.
At the beginning of the present century
the money value of the British fleet was
not quite $50,000,000. Since JBS9 Great
Britain has expended $:i00.000,000 in build
ing new ships and the present value of the
459 serviceable vessels is given at $540,
--000.000, segregated as follows: Sixty-four
battle-ships, s26o,ooo,ooo; 119 protected cruis
ers, $145,155,000; 22 armored cruisers, $56,
-1i35,000, and the remaining 254 vessels, con
sisting of cruisers, gunboats, torpedo
boat destroyers, etc., at $75,150,000.
The Swedish Government recently In
vited bids from ship-builders at home and
abroad to build a couple of armored ves
sels of limited size. Eighteen bids were
received, of which four were from home
yards, eight from Great Britain, one
Danish, three German and two French.
The absence of American bids is not be
cause of Inability to compete in that line
but on account of all the prominent At
lantic shipyards having n surfeit of
private and Government work.
A European naval war would bring
many disagreeable surprises to the sev
eral powers, for the number of "lame
ducks" would be numerous. The French
and Russian navies abound in such; the
modern armored fleet of France is rarely
away from the dockyards undergoing he
roic treatment, and there are ugly rumors
about some of the new ships of Russia.
The armored cruiser Rurik, of 11,000 tons,
on the China station, is said to be in a
bad state, the wood sheathing being rot
ten and the supposed armored belt of 10
inches is alleged to consist in places of
wooden blocks which also are rotting.
The French torpedo-ship Bouvet of
12,205 tons, completed only a few months
ago, has been ordered to Toulon for ex
tensive repairs. Her trial developed the
fact that the engine foundations were too
light, and as a consequence could not
work up to the requisite horsepower. The
repairs, as they are called, will consist in
taking out the triple-screw engines, re
moving the foundations, which are part
of the hull, and substitute adequate beds
for the machinery, all of which will con

sume much time and money. The Bouvet
was begun in January, 1593, and launched
in April, 1596, and cost over $5,000,000. Her
speed, which was to be 17% knots, fell
greatly short of the calculation, and even
at a reduced speed there was danger of a
complete breakdown of the engines.
The mean consumption of the American
water-tube boilers tried on the British
gunboat Sheldrake were found to be less
than for cylindrical boilers developing the
same horsepower and under like condi
tions. Nine runs, aggregating 9000 miles,
were made under horsepowers varying
from 1500 to 2150, and the corrected aver
age of coal burned was 1.63 pounds per
horsepower per hour. The steam ranged
from 120 to 150 pounds, the average being
146 pounds, and 9.X pounds of coal were
consumed to each square foot of grate
surface. The objection to water-tube
boilers in the merchant service has
hitherto been on account of the idea that
these boilers were not as economical as
the old style, but the performance of the
Sheldrake and on the Norwegian steamer
Tasso would indicate that there is no
longer a foundation for such belief. The
latter vessel had her Scotch boilers re
moved and American water-tube substi
tuted, with tin- result that in six voyages
aggregating 9200 miles there was a saving
of ninety tons of coal and an increase in
.speed of six-tenths of a knot.
GOOD WORDS FOR THE
THIRTEENTH INFANTRY
BUTTB, Mont., Oct. 10, 1899.
Editor San Francisco Call â Dear Sir: In
a special dispatch to the Anaconda
Standard, dated October 9, from San
Francisco, 1 notice the following state
ment in an interview with Major J. J.
Weisenberger of the First Washington
Volunteers, just returned, from Manila,
viz. :
"The American people do not realize
! the gravity of the Philippine situation.
The entire Thirteenth Regiment of regu
lar infantry uropped their arms, their
haversacks anil their baggage and fled
iiku sheep beiore a midniglit insurgent at
tack, li waa not the lauit of me men.
\\ lien they nave huu a suiuier's training
they Will ue the equal ot any men m the
isianiJs. They were bundled aboard their
transport beiore they even knew how to
I load their guns. \\ nen the ship reached
Manila thej ditembaikeci at unce, and
I without any drilling whatever were
i marched to the tiring line and ordered to
make camp within signt ot the enemy's
I lines. Their colonel protested against the
! orders, explaining that his men were un
: disciplined."
i have never before had occasion to ap
! peal to a newspaper tur correction of
! tacts, but assuming that Major Weisen-
I berger has been correctly quoted 1 wish
to aav that his statement is so grossly
inaccurate and so manifestly unjust to a
â  galiant regiment that 1 feel compelled to
- ueiall the circumstances that occasioned
! this story.
I Acting aa aid to Brigadier General Sam
uel Uvenshine In the advance on Para
naque on the 10th day of June, whose
brigade consisted of tne Fourteenth In
'â  fantrv, Thirteenth Infantry and part of
I the Twelfth Infantry and Sixth Artllley,
I all of these troops came under my per
j Bonal observation.
To the Thirteenth Infantry was given
the task of clearing the country of insur
gents resisting the advance on the right
flank, and gallantly and speedily was It
done.
During the day in a march of fifteen
miles over foothills, through tall tangled
grass, without water and under a blazing
tropical sun, this regiment out of a total
of nearly 1300 lost 263 men from heat ex
haustion, who were left behind, to follow
the column when able to walk. Some of
these men. among whom was Colonel
Smith, commanding the regiment, re
turned to Manna, but the greater part
were sufficiently refreshed during the cool
i of the evening to rejoin their command
thai night. Other regiments in this expe
dition lost proportionately as many men
in this march, which was one of the most
trying ever undertaken around Manila.
On the night of the loth of June General
Ovenshlne's brigade went Into camp about
one and a half miles from Las Plnas. Out
posts were stationed at different points
from three to six hundred yards from the
brigade, forming a complete cordon
around tho camp.
During the night, while it was raining
and intensely dark, the two hundred Chl
nainen accompanying the brigade as
packers, stampeded and rushes among
the troops, crying that the Filipinos had
surprised us. This alarm was so palpably
false that the officers jumped in among
their troops. Quieted them and then put
them under arms.
There was no confusion; not a phot was
fired, not a company moved from Its po
sition, not a man threw down his arms
and "fled like sheep" ; Indeed, it was the
occasion of remark among officers at the
time that the Thirteenth infantry, newly
recruited as It was, should show such
Bti adiness under such trying circum
stances. Two men out of nearly .WK) got
hysterical and h;ul to be forcibly quieted.
This is simply all there is to the story
of the Thirteenth Infantry throwing down
their arms and fleeing like sheep before a
midnight attack of insurgents, and It ir
a matter of regret to me that T feel called
upon to denounce such a fabrication by
an officer belonging to n regiment that
acquitted itself so gallantly under all cir
cumstances In the Philippine Islands.
F. W. HUNT,
Late Captain First Tdaho Volunteers.
Bryan's Letter to Morton.
Omaha Bop
Former Secretary J. Sterling Morion
has finally produced the letter written to
him by William Jennings Bryan in ISS9.
In which Mr. Bryan says in black and
white that he is seeking office not for
the honor, but for the money that is in it.
Colonel Bryan has denied positively that
he ever gave expression to such a senti
ment as would place him upon a jevel
With the ordinary office :Â»<:eker who
looks upon politics as an occupation pnd
its emoluments as a means of living.
Colonel Bryan will probably now come
boldly forward and admit that he had
forgotten the existence of this letter
written tir.der circumstances which
might justify its contents. As a young
lawyer â¢urupprlirg for a standing in his
Drofeeslon Mr. Bryan liad a serfect
right to apply for a sinecure office whose
salary would' have been in the nat,
a find, while the duties would in no way
Interfere with his continued practice I
Yet eoaally significant with thr sordid
sentiment of the letter and raor,
niflcant than his denial of its utt<
f s the fact that the appointment
Mr Bryan was at that time, seeking.
that of State Railway Commissioner, was
one in which the railroads were particu
larly concerned, and that to secure
appointment he went for his md
ment.Â« to the men known to represent
the railroad interests. In what light
does this leave the Presidential candi
date, posing as the self-constituted en
emy of ..orporate aggression and
stahtlv using as his political capital hia
alleged antagonism to railway monopoly â¢
If Mr Bryan was ready to seek
road aid f/ secure the first office to
which he aspired, what faith can now be
put in his assertions that he n.presfn;.s
only the plain people, for whom ru- is
fighting the aggregations of wealth?
What he would have done had the rail
roads complied with his prayer to sup
port him for a commission as State
Board of Transportation secretary will
have to he left to the imagination, but
no one -an doubt that his s<-r.se cl
tude would have prompted a full re
quital for the favor thus received.
Viewed from this standpoint, the
Bryan-Morton letter is a revelation
which cannot but weaken the position of
Its author before the people.

San Francisco Republicans had the fir?!;
grand rally of their municipal campaign

POLITENESSâ S. A., City. This cor
respondent writes: "A gentleman is intro
duced to a young lady at a private house.
By chance they take the same car to
reach their respective homes. The lady
lives at a point between the starting point
and the gentleman's home. She is not
escorted by any one. Should the gentle
man leave the car with her and escort
her to her home?" In a case of that kind,
the gentleman knowing that the lady is
without an escort could offer to escort
her to her home, but should the lady
decline, he need not repeat the offer, and
all he would have to do would be to raise
his hat and say "good evening" as she
leaves the car.

names should not be expunged. All that
Is required of them Is that they appear
before 10 o'clock to-morrow (Tuesday)

ANNIVERSARY OF THE PARTY
â¦
SPLENDID BTJXLSHEAD BREAK
FAST AT SAN LEANDRO.
â¦ i.
Democratic Love Feast Addressed by
Judge James G. Maguire, Max
Popper, Frank H. Gould
and F. T. Williams.
The fiftieth anniversary of the forma
tion of the Democratic party in San Fran
cisco was celebrated yesterday by the
Iroquois Club at Estudillo Park, San
Leandro, and was notable on account of
the absence of gold Democrats, who are
"persona non grata" with the Jefferson
lan Lroquols braves. It was essentially
a Bryan gathering, and the name of the
silver champion was greeted several times
with prolonged cheers. Mayor Phelan
was expected, but did not put in an ap
pearance, probably owing to the difference
of opinion entertained by himself and the
club regarding the injection of national
affaire into municipal politics. Phelan will
have none of national issues, but the Iro
quois are hot after the scalps of those
Democrats who deserted the Bryan
standard for the gold gonfalon of the
other wing of the party.
Notwithstanding these dissensions the
breakfast given to commemorate the
golden jubilee of the party was a grand
success. It was given in the open air un
der a canopy of grape vines and more
than two hundred guests Bat down at the
tables.
The committee of arrangements con
sisted of Louis Metzger (chairman), Dr.
William J. Bryan, L. V. Merle, A. uhlen
brock, Oscar Hocks. J. B. Keenan and
A. D. Lemon. Besides providing an ex
cellent band for the entertainment of the
guests the committee provided for the
company twelve bullsheads, eighty-four
chickens, three lambs, twenty dozen egg 3
and frijoles ad lib., to say nothing 01 a
varied assortment of other refreshments.
Charles Edelman, whose silver resolu
tion was turned down at the Phelan con
vention, presided at the merry gathering,
and seated near him were the guests of
honorâ Judge James G. Maguire, Frank
H. Gould, Max Popper and Henry T. Wil
liamsâwho delivered the speeches of the
day. Mr. Williams was present at the
open-air meeting in Portsmouth Square
October 25, 1849, when the Democratic
party was organized in this city.
After the discussion of the many good
things the rain drove the merry gather
ing into the pavilion near by, where
Toastmaster Edelmann called on the fol
lowing gentlemen to respond to toasts:
"The Democracy of the Past," Max Pop
per; 'The Democracy of the Present,"
Frank H. Gould; "The Democracy of the
Future," Judge James G. lUaguire. Henry
Williams recounted the early history of
the party and bespoke a splendid future
for San Francisco, which he had seen
grow from a thousand souls to its present
number.
Among the prominent Democrats in at
tendance, many of them with their wives,
were:
Max Popper, Oscar Hocks, Henry F. Wil

111. COMEDY OF ERRORS.
Critical Study of the Play.
It must be confessed that the first rpad
ing of the "Comedy of Errors" is disap
pointing to one who has known the
"myriad-minded" Shakespeare in hia
maturer work. One almost agrees with
Hazlitt's well-known condemnation of the
play: the plot Is one of farce rather than
of genuine remedy, there is an abundance
of puns :ind conceits which are not even
of the fh-'it order; doggerel verse abounds,
and in the best passages there is an abuse
of rhyme, an artificiality of diction; and
withal the play is lacking in characteriza
tion. One wonders as he turns from
"Macbeth" and "Othello" to the "Comedy
of Emirs" how the same man could have
written these plays. Whatever success
may have attended the acting of the lat
ter (and there is evidence that it has been
successful on the stage), it surely is not
popular with readers, and will never be.
although Ith title is on all lips. People
who look upon Shakespeare us a great
miracle with infinite
powers full grown
from the beginning,
or as unconnected
with the movements
<>f the Elizabethan
age, will find but
little to confirm
their theory of this
play. Surely he was
not gifted ii his In-
fancy as Gray Bug-
Rests in his "Prog-
i-'-sh of Poesy."
The fact Is that O.M
chronological simlyM
of Shakespcare'sH
plays soon illspelsM
the idea that he wasM
a prodigy nn<ll
causes one to mnil!-l
fy the s.imt-whiitÃ
enthusiastic wnr<l*H
of Cella, so oftenM
taken as an i'xpr<<s-^^^^^^^^^^^^^^H
s!on of the author's genius: "0 wonder
ful, most wonderful, wonderful and yet
again wonderful, and after that out of all
whooping." Shakespeare grew as any
other man doesâ ln his own character, in
the mastery of his art and in his knowl
edge of human life. Furnivall in his ex
cellent preface of the Leopold edition of
Shakespeare gives a good suggestion as to
the study of the plays: ,
THE BACK OF SHAKESPEARE'S HOUSE.
The first necessity Is to regard Shakespeare
as a whole; his work as a living- organism,
each a member of one created unit, the whole
a tree of healing and of comfort to the nations.
A growth from small beginnings to mighty
ends, the successive rhooti of one great mind,
which can never be seen In its full glory of
leaf and blossom and fruit unless it be viewed
In its oneness.
If nineteenth-century scholarship has
somewhat modified the enthusiasm of the
earlier writers on Shakespeare, ye i.j not
admire nis art less; we known him better
and understand his work more lnt"lii
gently. In such a play as the "Comedy
of Errors" we see him in the workshop,
and the earnest student of Shakespeare
will lie Interested in studying him there,
for he will notice first those defects
which tV.e dramatist outgrew ar.d tben
the elements of genius that prophesy well
hi? later development in dramatic art.
And, first, let us study the play, notic- I
ing its imperfections. Destructive criti- !
clsm does not always foster the proper
attitude of rr.ind toward a work of art,
but when combined with constructive
criticism it is an Indispensable part of all
literary study. One cannot appreciate 'he
highest excellence in any field of work
unless he recognizes that that is not ex
cellent. A student of "Othello," for
Instance. is the more appreciative of that
play for having felt the defects of the
"Comedy of Errors."
We note In this play an absence of |
Shakespeare's sure mastery of verse. He j
Is at this time making use of the dog
trerol verse so generally employed by his ;
contemporaries, especially the loose Al- :
exandrine which was introduced in early
Elizabethan literature to express serious
moods, but which later tended to produce i
humorous effects, as in this play. It is
the natural language of the Dromion:
Wcs there ever any man thus beaten out of !
season.
When In the why and wherefore Is neither |
rhyme nor reason.
In nearly the fntlre second scene of act j
111 this doggerel verse is used, and we
can but feel frequently that it 1h "with- â 
out rhyme or reason." Besides doggerel
verse, we note the frequent use of the j
rhymed lambic pentameter, especially in j
the conversations between Luclana and !
Adrlana, noticeable also In the use of the
alternate rhymes in the conversations of
Luclana and Antipholus of Syracuse.
Now rhyme is not capable of the high- ;
est dramatic use, and the reader should
see how In this play it is an obstacle to j
the dramatic dialogue. Even when the
poel uses blank verse, as in the first and
last acts, It lacks the freedom Of the
blank verse of his maturer work: there
nre comparatively no "run-on lines" In
the play, the voice coming tn a pause
at the end of every line. Fur nl vail makes
the proportion of run-on lines in the
"Comedy of Errors" as 1 to IM, while In
"Hamlet" it Is us 1 to l.Fi. Then we find
few extra syllables, showing that the j
dramatist is metorbound and has not the
freedom that the true master of dra
matic blank verse needs. Not to com
ment on this point further, we refer the
reader to an excellent discussion of j
Shakespeare's progress in the use of '
blank verse by Dr. <'<>rson In his "Intro
duction to Shakespeare," where many ex
amples are given from this ami other
plays to illustrate th* poet's early liml- :
tations as compared with the remarkable
power shown in his later plays.
Although this play is pre-eminently a
humorous one, we easily detect the lack
of the highest humor; as already sug
gested, puns and conceits are numerous.
Not that Shakespeare ever ceased to
make use of these, but there Is by no
means such an abundance of them, nor
such dependence on them, in his later
plays. Compare, for Instance, the puna
of the Dromlos with those of the grave
diggers in "Hamlet" or of the fool in
"King Lear." Aside from the frequent I
puns, we find that wit and imagery are |
drawn out to the point of exhaustion in
the studied words of Dromio of Ephesus
or the more spontaneous words of his j
brother. We feel that in this play there ;
is a lack of that great wisdom that makes
the humor of his later comedies and trag
edies so significant.
More vital than the points already sug
gested, perhaps, is the artificial grouping :
of charactersâ the mathematical sym- !
metry of the play. This arises from the j
dramatist's use of stage conventions. i
Barrett Wendell in his recent hook on |
Shakespeare has made an admirable
study of Shakespeare's adherence to the
conventional laws of the stage in his early I
plays and to his gradual deliverance from i
them. In the "Comedy of Errors" we ;
have the two Antlpholuses, the Dromios, !
the two sisters, Adriana and Luciana,
and Afgron and Aemilia.
One can readily see that the effect of
the play largely depends on the grouping
of characters. All this Is but to say that
â¢we miss individual characterisation. It
ia true if one studies the play as care-
IN SHAKESPEARE.
Â»w.len. Dr. William J. Rolfe. Dr. Hamilton W.
1, Dr. Isaac N. Demmon, Dr. Vtda D. Scud-
fully as Mr. Knight has he may detect
by moans of the language and their gen
eral conduct the contrasts In the respec
tive characters, but in the main they lack
Individuality. The play lacks organic
life; there is too much of mechanical
structure. Character Is subordinated to
plot and Incident, whereas the reverse
should be true.
After all has been Bald, however, as to
the Imperfections of the play, one is Im
pressed with the fact that there are many
signs of future development. One feels
throughout the subtle touches and sug
gf-FticiiK that betoken the master.
Shakespeare was even then greater
than tnis play indicates. There w.-n la
tent possibilities not yet called into being;
he was a young man full of undln
power. He had not come Into the full
possession of his birthright. But there
art Hoes and scenes in the "Comedy ot
Errors" that have the impress of genius
upon themâ that cause a student of Mar
lowe and other contemporary dramatists
to confess that a new master had arisen,
though the play as a whole may not be
equal to the best of these men. Such
lines as these are to the point, the words
of Antipholus of Syracuse, in which he
Bpeaks in a tone of melancholy of hia
long-lost and long-sought brother:
I to the world am like a dror ol water
That in the ocwin seeks another drop,
Who. falling there to find his fellow forth,
Unseen, inquisitive, confounds himself;
So I, to find a mother and a brother.
In quest of them, unhappy, lose myself.
Again we may cite the words of J,ucl
ana to Adriana that may have In them a
tinge of Shakespeare's own experience:
There's nothing situnte un.ler heaven's eye
Hut huth his bound. In earth, in sea, in sky;
The beasts, the fishes and the winged fowls
Are thtir males' subjects and at their controls;
Men, more divine, the masters of all these,
Lords of the wide world and wild watery seaa.
Indued with intellectual sense and souls.
Of more pre.-'Tiilnenrc than the fish and fowle.
Are masters to their females, and
linen let your will attend on their accords.
The words of love with which Amipho
lus of Syracuse addressses I,uciana have
in them some of the lyrical melody of
"Romeo and Juliet":
Oh, train me not, sweet mermaid, with thy
note,
: To drown me in thy sister's flood of tears;
Sing-, siren, for thyself and I will dote;
Spread o'er the sliver waves thy golden hairs.
And, as abed, I'll take them and there lie.
And In that glorious supposition, think
He gains by death that hath such means to die;
Let love, being light, be drowned. If she sink.
Altogether different from these pas
sages is the description of Dr. Pinch in
words that are in Shakespeare's best
manner:
Along with them
They brought one Pinch, a hungry, lean-faced
villain.
A mere anntomy, a mountebank,
A threadbare jugrgler and a fortune-teller.
A n iy. hollow-eyed, sharp-looking wretch,
A living-dead man; this pernicious slave;
Forsooth, took on him as a conjurer,
And. gazing in mine eyes, feeling my pulse.
And with no face, as 'twere, outfacing me.
Cries out, I was possessed.
More important, however, than the
scenes and passages to which reference
has been made is the interweaving of the
tragic and comic elements of the play.
Shakespeare departs from his original,
the "Menoeehm!" of Plautus, in intro
ducing the pathos of the stories of Aegeon
and Aemilia, and the breaking up of their
family; there is always significance in the
departures that Shakespeare makes from
his original. Af Swinburne says. "What
is due to Shakespeare and to him alone
is the honor of having embroidered on the
naked old canvas of comic acting those
flowers of elegiac beauty which vivify
and diversify the scenes of Plautus." One
feels the contrast between the words of
the Dromios or Dr. Pinch and these sad
words of Aegeon upon not being recog
nized by his sonâ words that have in them
a suggestion of Lear's passion:
N( t know my voice! Oh, time's extremity.
Hast thou so cracked and splltted my poor
tongue
In seven short years that here my only son
Knows not my feeble key of untuned cares?
Th nigh mm this grained face of mine be hl4
In sap-consuming winter's drizzled SHOW
And all the conduits of my flood froze up,
Yet hath my night of life some memory.
My wasting lamrs some fading slimmer left.
My dull < :irs a little use to hear;
All these old witnessesâ l cannot errâ
Tell me thru art my SOB Antipholus.
Yes, he is already something more than
the mere humorist, and something more
than the mere classic dramatist, obeying
th<-> laws of "unity" of the classic drama.
From the comic writer, pure and simple,
we should not have had the first and last
scenes, and the undertone of sadness that
may be heard in the words of the more
serious Antlpholua of Syracuse. From the
lc dramatist we should have ex
pected the strict obedience to the laws
of dramatic unity found in this play, but
not the Mending of humor and pathos,
so characteristic of the romantic drama.
From this DOlnt of view the "Comedy of
Error*" may b< retarded as the final triumph
nt ttv- new romantic drama over its opponents;
It carried the warfare int" the enemy's camp
and prorip'i tho signal victory of harmonizing
old an.l newâ the conventional canons of LatiD
comedy and the pathos of romanticism.

CYCLER WING
SECURES ALL
THE HONORS
From the Start He Outstrips
All Riders in the Ten-
Mile Handicap.
John E. "Wine, the speedy racer of the
Garden City Wheelmen, San Jose, won
lirst time and first place in the sixth an
nual nuturon handicap of the California
Associated Cycling Clubs yesterday, over
the ton-mile course from Fruitvale to
llaywards.
Wing started from the scratch mark
nnu passed forty-five men, some of whom
the handicapper had started two and a
half minutes ahead of him. He managed
to overtake the last man about a hundred
yards from the finish. For a moment
Wing led, then fell back a little Into the
surrounding bunch and the spectators
thought he was too exhausted to finish.
Jitjt the doughty San Joseun had still an
other sprint left and in the la*t few revo
lutions of ills pedals again assumed the
Jia<i and was not beaded to the tape. The
.second man. E. A. Kusuc of the Bay City
Club, was but a fifth of a second behind
him. ,
The finish was truly a spectacular one.
The riders came in In buncnes of from six
to a dozen, generally two or three
abreast, and it was exceedingly ditttcult
for the judges to catch their numbers ac
curately, so rapidly did they Hash by. The
first six men were but a fifth of a sec
mid apart and seldom did one rider come
in alone. , ,
Of accidents there were the usual num
ber incident to a road-race but no more.
Walter Davidson fell four times and yet
finished in a fair position. George Ferris
would have been a factor at the finish
had he not broken his wheel en route
and lost time getting another from a by
stander. : rank Carroll broke his chain.
Warren and Reuser both tasted of mother
ear til. Berg, Adams and Rice collided
just as they crossed the tape and caused
considerable confusion. They escaped
with a few scratches.
Of the fifty-two original entrants In the
rac-' forty-six started and thirty-four fin
ished. Jt' is Interesting to note the way
the rider? of the blp clubs showed up.
The Bay Citys start ti fourteen me and
flnibhed.- tenâ more â ..in any other club in
the race. Olympics started twelve and
finished eight." Garden Cltys started eight.
finished eight.
Wing, the winner, i* no novice at th 6
pa me. having been riding for five seasons.
Tie has always been a factor in the an
imal ten-mile event. In i^'.<> he finished in
nineteenth pi ice, but made best time,
2.'j:5'.i2-5. In 1596. he finished in seventy
fourth place out of 115; time 26:36. This
was the year Howard Squires made his
Brent record of 34:20, which has never
been equaled. In IttiS. he finished forty
fourth in 2S::JS. His time yesterday was
V:H> flat. San Jose was destined to take
nil the time honors, for the second and
third best times were made respectively
by M. F. Francis and E. B. Wastle of the
Garden City (Hub, 28:49 and 26:50.
Considering the fact that over half the
entrants wer<* men new to the race, the
otlicial handicapper's allotments were ex
cellent, as the bunches at the finish at
test. .Many of the men who had agreed
to eÂ« rye as officials, however, attended
the Olympic Club outing at Escalles in
stead; and but lor the efforts and hard
work <it a few the finish might not have
been properly scored. Special credit in
this resptrt is therefore due Chairman W.
].. Loos of the raring board, Charles Al
bert Adams, Archie Reid, F. G. Monte
aic-gre, S. G. Scoverh, .1. .1. B. Argenti, J.
A. Deslmone", H. V. Ready and 11. W.
Spalding.
Besides: the individual prizes to the rid
ers, the Garden City Club takes final pos-
Bession of the beautiful Olympic cup, hav
ing vvon it three times In an association
event by Wing's victory yesterday. Wing
himseii vrill draw down two expensive
suits of ciothes, and the other first fifteen
iM'Ti will all gK something fur their speed.
The flicial table tolls the lie in full:

Gus Abercrcmbie's Rock Isl-

Park Opsn Stake.
Gus Abercrombie's brlndle greyhound
I Rock Island Boy met and defeated T. J.
Cronln's Thornhill in the final of the open
stake at Union Park yesterday after an I
undecided course. The yore In this was j
I four to four and in the decisive course j
| 10 to 3. Both were run In the gloom of
the evening and the spectators could only
discern Thornhill's white form in the
flight of the dogs across the field. The
color of his opponent blended with that
of the earth, leaving nothing to mark his j
progress during the course. The hare was
a strong one, taking the dogs clear across
the field and then making good Its escape.
In the final of the sapling stake D. J.
Eiealey' Slsquoc beat Sterl & Knowles
OUta. Both are Emln Pasha- aye
youngsters.
The sport went on without interruption
throughout the afternoon, notwithstand
ing the rain which fell almost continu
ously. "Judge" Grace and the other field
officials were protected by rubber cloth
ing from the Inclement weather. The
hares ran strongly in a number of in-:
| stances, taking thÂ«; dogs around the field.
The longest course of the day was be
! tween Lady Emma and St. Anthony, the
former winning after running three mm- j
utes and forty-eight seconds. The score j
was 29 to IS. Lady Emma was then with
drawn, giving Rock Island Boy an acci
dental bye in the next round.
Lavender beat .Maori Land, thirty-nine

At San Mateo Pork.
Greyhounds from the ki nnels of R. E.
de B. Iyopez nearly swept the card at
San Mateo Coursing Park yesterday.
They won both the stakes, while Mln
neola, from the same kennels, made a
brilliant showing In the final of the stake
: stponed from the previous week. She
led '-'a.~ii to the him , but the latter
swerved, plHoini.' Cash. The two grey
hounds alternated In possession, but ran
nearly head ami head throughout. The
rain fell almost continuously throughout
the afternoon and was especially heavy
dining the course between t'.ish and Mln-
\ It had a depressing effect on the sport
I and on the attendance. "Judge" Jerome
was again at variance with the specta
tors; who took exception to a number of
'< his decisions. Some questioned the Cash-
Minneola decision, but the principal dem
-1 onstrations were on the course between
Gold 11111 and Rest Assured; Black Bess
j and Lady Marion and Royal Buck and
Lady Marion. In both the latter courses I
the* spectators thought Lady Marion was
unduly favored. "When Lady Marion beat
I Black Bess a light ensued In the stand.
Two spectators had bet on the result
and the loser refused to pay on the !
"judge's" decision, claiming he bad erred.
It was announced unofficially during the !
meeting yesterday that "Judge" C. J. Je-
I rome would Lie replaced by some local
man next Saturday.
The coursing was of a high class, the
harts being Strong and taking the dogs !
all over the field. The officials were fa
i inillur with their duties and there were
. but few delays. In the second round of I
the open stake Minnie Wa Wa and Whit'- j
head of the Lopez kennels came together. '
; Mr. Lopez claimed the right to with
draw the former and secure a bye course
, for Whitehead. To this J. O'Shea, owner
; of Young America, demurred. As his dog
would be guarded with Minnie Wa Wa
he claimed the accidental bye. The dis
â  cussion was ended by Minnie Wa Wa be
ing sent to the slips and running in her >

GILBERT WILL BUY
MOST ANY OLD THING
OXK IT. TV. Gilbert of South Carolina has come to town with a mania for
buying barber simps and anything else that is for sale. Who he Is or
from what source he derives iiis> healthy roll of batik notes is a dark
t. The habitues ot the tenderloin arc satisfied to know that he Is
a g i thing, and he is being thoroughly cultivated. He lias attempted to
buy several saloons and innumerable cigar stands in the city, but has fajled
rike a bargain. H<> has purchased a barber shop, however, and al
_;; iiÂ« has raised the wages of every man In the establishment Re baa
not been seen around the place since he paid his good money to gain posses
sion.
A few days ago the man of money from the South dropped Into Wolf
Bros.' cigar stand at 96 Ellis street and expressed a desire to buy out the
business on the spot. The proprietors refused to strike a bargain with him.
Determined upon buying something. Capitalist Gilbert visited Costley's bar
bur shop, a fÂ« w doors away.
"How much will you take for the whole bloomin' sheebang?" he inquired
of the proprietor. The boss was taken by surprise at the suddenness of the
proposition, but when he gained his second wind he expressed the opinion
that the stand was worth $2000.
"Give me the refusal of it for fifteen minutes." was Gilbert's reply, and
ished from the shop. In a short ilnie he returned with a full grown roll
of crisp bank notes and counted out $l*.hnj for t he astonished Costley. Notic
ing the ex-proprletor's hat still hanging on its customary peg Gilbert re
marked that he did not think that be would need it In the business. Costley
took :h>> hint and departed. After raisin--,' the wages of ev< ry employe of the
Gilbert placed .Ben Davis In charge as manager and has not been seen
since.
The queer spirits that were guiding 1 Mr. Gilbert's movements also led *
him to se\<rul saloons, every one of which he attempted to buy. !!â¢â  also made
offers foi several other barber shops and boasted that he had $30,000 to in- J
vest In any o!<i thin^ that was for sale In the far West. He was not Riven 4
an opportunity to make any other purchases befute he was taken in charge O
by some friends and retired from the market. Where he is at present is not â¦
known, and no notice has been given to thu tenderloin of the date of his reap- O
pearance. q
Mr. Gilbert is a prominent Eastern Klk and is a descendant of one of the x
best known families of South Carolina, lie came to this city on a visit q
partly n>r his health and partly for pleasure. It would appear that he de- 4
rives a goodly share of the latter buying barber shops. o

GOOD SPORT ON THE MARSH.
Gunners Return From the Preserves
With Game Baps Well Laden
With Ducks.
For the first time this season the gun
men have found satisfactory sport among
the ducks. The weather conditions
brought the birds down in large numbers,
and they found men on the various pre
serves ;i\vaiting their coming.
The result was seen last night, as every
train from both the north and the south
bore sportsmen heavily laden with ducks
of many varieties. The men of the Olym
pic, Jbis. Teal, Black Jack and other gun
clubs near Cordelia and Suisun all en
joyed better shooting than at any other
time since the season opened. The same
conditions obtained to the southward, near
Alvarado and Alvlso. at the preserve of
tbo Spooney Gun Club and at Willow
L/odgo.
SOME FISHY
BALL PLAYED
IN THE RAIN
Lobsters and Locals Divide
Honors in the Morning and
Afternoon Games.
San Francisco 7, Santa Cruz 2.
Few spectators took in the afternoon
game yesterday at Recreation Park and
those few saw little baseball, although
both Lobsters and Wasps wallowed in
mud and rain for seven Innings, Umpire
Sheridan kept the players going for all
but two innings. When the game was
over the diamond was full of small lakes
and the pitcher's box was transformed
Into rich, slimy, oozing mud.
It may have been the rain that damp
ened the spirits of the players or it may
have been something else. No matter
what it was. there was never such base
ball as was seen In the fifth inning. Both
teams were offenders and should have
been ruled off the diamond. The men
simply wouldn't play and they made no
pretense of doing so, although they went
through the forms. As usual, Whelan of
Santa Cruz made himself an object of
remark by his conduct, or rather, mis
conduct, and received all the hisses and
groans the small crowd was capable of
giving. This inning was not only a far
cical but a disgusting exhibition.
In the first inning San Francisco put
four men over the plate. Brockhoff made
first on an error and advanced a bag on
Hildebrand's out. A single by Krug
moved him up another bag and so"on after
; Sullivan went to tirst on balls, filling the
â  bags. A passed ball and Brockhoff
scored. Then Courtney rolled out a dou
ble, scoring Krug and Sullivan. Courtney
was? the fourth man to pass the rubber
In this Inning. In the third inning Hllde
brand earned first and scored on King's
double.
The sixth inning brought a run to
I' risen and two to the Lobsters. Court
ney swatted the ball for two bags and
made third on Rellly's single, scoring on
a juggle of Pyne's hit by Andrews. For
: banta Cruz, McCarthy went to first on
an error and third on Babbitt's double.
A single by lieveraux scored McCarthy
and advanced Babbitt a base. Babbitt
scored on Drennan's out. The score Is:

MORNING GAME.
Santa Cruz 6, San Francisco 3.
The morning game was the single vic
tory that Snnta Cruz sandwiched in be
tween two defeats and. as it was played
on the Oakland grounds, the crowd was
joyful at the result.
The first inning brought a run to the
Lobsters in easy manner. Babbitt walked
to first on balls and finished his course
around the bags when Drennan shot a
long-distance fly to Muller in the left ter
ritory. Muller forgot to hold the ball and
Babbitt scored.
The third was a banner Inning for Santa
Cruz. Babbitt reached first on Muller's
; error, but did not stop there. Half
â  around the course he went before the
1 locals awoke from their sleep. Devereaux
; followed with a hit and Drennan can
i tered to first on four that didn't please
Sheridan, filling all the bags. A hot liner
to right scored Babbitt and Devereaux
and later on Drennan crossed the rubber
on Morrow's hit.
Not until the fifth inning did the San
Franciscans manage to score. Reilly
and Pyne died hard deaths, but Muller
found first on McCarthy's error. Iburg
got Into the running on four balls and
an error by Clark put Brockhoff on first.
Hildebrand then rapped out a two bag
ger, scoring Muller and Iburg. In the
seventh Muller scored again.
Santa Cruz added to its list a run in
the seventh and another in the eighth.
The last was made by McCarthy and was
due to a combination of a pair of two
baggersâ by himself, the other by
Babbitt. The score:

SHOOTING IN THE RAIN.
Marksmen Compete for Prizes at the
Harbor View Range.
For an off day. and a wet one at that,
then* was considerable rifle and pistol
shooting: at the Harbor View ranÃo yester
day. The principal event was the conclu
sion of the Swiss Rifle Club's competition
for class medals. The permanent owner
ship of these trophies depended in several
instances upon the scores made at the
last shoot of the season. In this the high
guns of the day In twenty shots on the
German twenty-five ring target were as
follows:
Champion class: A. Gehret, 418 rings;
tiixt class, J. 1-. Irffman, 404; second class, A.
Studer, 395; third class, A. Monotti, 345.
Vpon this showlnp the prizes fell to the
following for the high scores of the year:
Champion class medal. A. Gehret. 1253 rinps;
first class medal, J. 1.. Leemnn, 1217; second
class medal, A. Studer, 1161; third class medal,
F. Suter, 1090.
The club also held Its regular monthly
bullseye competition for cash prizes. best

were:

A number of the members of the Co
lumbia Pistol and Rifle Club held a pri
vate fifty-shot match for a trophy, shoot
ing the 22-caliber rifle on the fifty-yard
range, Columbia target. Dr. J. F. 'Twist
and F. O. Young were pitted against A.
B. Dorrell and F. S. Washburn. None of
them shot their best, for which weather
and defective ammunition were duly
blamed. Washburn, in trying out the rifle
he was to use, which he had never
handled before, made the remarkable run
of 2. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 4, 1. 1. 3â16. showing that
he hit the Inch center seven times in ten
shots. One of the odd features of the con
test was that the two pair tied on their
totals. The results here given are in ten
shot scores:

again at some future date. While the con
test was on a number of other members

practice with the firearms of their choice

JEFF'S STYLE
OF FIGHTING
HAS CHANGED
When Ke Meets Sharkey
He Will Not Assume
Crouching Position.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Oct. 29.â Jam^s J. Jeffries
Is in perfect physical condition for his
battle with Thomas Sharkey at Coney Isl
and on Friday night. While admitting
that he might look lighter than when he
won the championship of the world from
Fitzsimmons, he said he was better train
ed now than he was for the contest with
the lanky Cornishman. He said that hts
muscles were harder and more firm and
the general state of his health was much
better than on that occasion. Jeffries
says that he now weighs 215 pounds and
feels strong. He declares that he is
more confident of success than when ne
met Fitzsimmons. t
"When 1 fought Fitzsimmons , saia
Jeffries, "1 was a little apprehensive as
to the result owing to his wonderful ring
record and the fact that he was champion
of the world. 1 had heard considerable
about his wonderful hitting powers and
all that sort of thing, but with bharkey
it is an entirely different proposition. 1
have fought Sharkey and beaten him. 1
know his .-style thoroughly, and although
he has improved considerably since we
met In San Francisco I am sun- I can
beat him again, l also have improved
since 1 fought Sharkey, and I think that
my tight with Fitzsimmons shows that I
have made more rapid progress m the
science of the manly art than hiis the
sailor. All fair-minded persons agree that
Fitzsimmons beat Sharkey fairly and
squarely. Now, why should not 1 beat
Sharkey?"
Tommy Ryan thinks that the Califor
nian will have little trouble knocking out
the sailor.
"Sharkey," cays Ryan, "will find in Jef
fries an entirely different style of fighter
from the man who fought Fitzsimmons.
The champion's crouching position, which
caused so much comment in his tight with
Fitzsimmons, will be conspicuous by its
absence when he meets the sailor. Jef
fries has learned a lot of new and uspful
information about ring tactics since that
battle. He is much cleverer and faster
to-day than ever. On his feet he Is just
as nimble as a lightweight and with his
hands he is the speediest big man that
ever fought in a ring. As to hitting
power 1 think he has much the better of
the argument with Sharkey. His knowl
edge of boxing to-day is second to that
of no pugilist in the world."
The arrival of William A. Brady at Jef
fries' camp yesterday was a pleasure to
the champion. The two chatted together
for Beveral hours and talked considerably
about the coming light. Brady was satis
lied with Jeffries' condition, and said he
saw nothing in the way <>f his winning
the fight. Jeffries had intended going out
on the road for his daily exercise, but
rain prevented and he was obliged to
train Indoors, although this was not
pleasing, as he tries to do as little work
as possible "ii Sunday. It has been set
tled that Jeffries and his retinue of train
ers will break camp next Friday morning
ami so direct to New Xork.
Looking -very inch a gladiator, with
bunch muscles standing out prominently
all over his body, and apparently in
physical condition that would justify Ms
fighting for his life In any contest of skill
urai is the way Thomas Sharkey
strikes the visitor who sees him training
at Newdorp. No man has trained more
conscientiously for a heavy-weight pugi
listic battle than the sailor-pugilist, who
confidently expects to defeat Jeffries on
Friday night. Tom not only thinks that
he Will win. but that he will do the trick
in doubi.- jig time. If Sharkey does not
win he certainly will go down to defeat
in a game fashion, because he has made
up his mind to fight from the start and to
win as quickly as possible.
"Nobody has ever been able to put me
out," said Sharkey to-day, "and 1 have
been hit on the Jaw hard and often. They
have managed to knock me down, but I
always came back and put them out.
Jeffries' victory over mo In San Francisco
was a gift from the referee. I beat him
fairly and should have received the deci
sion.' 1 only mention this in order not to
throw off my friends, who might figure
thai Jeffries will bo the winner on ac
count of that fight. I am going into the
ring on Friday night with Jeffries to do
or die. and between you and me and the
1 think that I will xlo Jeffries."
It is doubtful if two tiner specimens of
athletic young men have ever appeared
in a ring contest than Sharkey and Jef
fries. Neiti.er man has dissipated, and
both are young, strong and healthy.
The advance sale of tickets for the
fight has been enormous and indications
point to a packed house. Orders for
seats nave been received from as far
west as San Francisco. Although the
fight is but a few days off, but very few
big bets have been recorded on the con
tent. This his been due to a feeling of
apprehension owing to Jeffries' mishaps,
but now that the champion announces
that he is in perfect health and ready to
tight, many wigers will probably be \
placed on the result.
SHAMROCK READY TO
SAIL FOR ENGLAND
Yacht Has Been Especially Fitted
for the Long Voyage and Will
Start Tuesday.
NEW YORK. Oct. 20.â With her sails
bent and most of her sailors on board
the yacht Shamrock lies in Erie basin
ready to sail for Clyde on Tuesday.
Captain Archie Hogarth will be in com
mand, with Captain Hamilton as navi
gator and Captain "Wringe as chief
officer. Fi>rty-three of the crew are to
sail in the yacht. This number includes
two cooks and two stewards. The rest
of the crew will return by steamer.
It is the intention of Captain Hogarth
to sail as much as possible when there
is breeze. The steam yacht Erin, which
will convoy the Shamrock, will tow her
when there is no wind. In addition to
the big mainsail with a bonnet in it, and
the mizzen, which brails up against the
mast, the yacht is to carry a large fore
stay sail also with a bonnet in it, a Jib
and jib topsail, a square sail and raffee.
This latter is a triangular sail which sets
over the square sail. No main boom is
to be used, but the mizzen sheets out to
a small boom. The yacht has been
strongly braced. Riveted to the seventy
nine frames on each side of, the yacht
is a stout steel fore and aft girder or
bllgo keel; overhead, but further inboard
under the deck beams is a lighter steel
girder, also running lore and aft. These
upper and lower girders are connected
at Intervals of about twenty feet by s ltd
round stanchions, which slant outboard
from above at an angle of about 30 de
grees. Between these stanchions cross
braces have been placed, bolted at their
junction in the center to a square steel
plate which makes the whole rigid. This
system extends from the fifteenth for
ward frame all the way aft on both side?
There is no "skin" batch, all ditch, ali
her frame and plates being visible, ex
cent where the temporarily covered flat
lapsed. Heavy wooden checks have been
fitted between the frames forward where
the strain of "pounding" will come
against the nlates in a seaway. They
are held in place by long fore' and aft
planks down to the frames and
bilge keels.
Hit With the Spoke of a Wheel.
Frank Adrian, who lives at the Central
House. STI Market street, was drinking
cheap wine in rear of the fruit store. 104

MAYOR SNOW'S METHOD OF
USING SECRET FUND.
-â â¦
Generosity of Uncle Sam Spoiled by j
the Obstinacy and Narrowness
of Those Whom He
Would Benefit.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, October 29.
Judge Yule docs not enjoy a monopoly |
of the opinion thai there are more digfti- :
lied things for a city the size of Oakland j
to do than to invite and accept a gift for
a free library from a stranger on whom
< Mkland has not and never did have, nor !
i* likely to have, the slightest claim. It ,
is rather amusing: that while there is such |
a tremendous tcry for public parks for j
this city, the Library Trustees and the I
Board of Education should agree to en- j
croach upon one of the few public squares :
by placing a larce building upon it. It is
a very clever way to get out of the difli- !
culty, and that is about all the commen- '
elation that can be said for the scheme. j
The enthusiasm with which a committee )
etarted out several weeks ago to collect!
$:>O,OOOO. with which to buy a site, soon i
cooled off. They found that it was prac- ;
tically an impossibility to collect such a
Bum of money blindly, and as they had no
particular site in view and knew not what
sum would be required to purchase such
a site, it cannot be said that the com
mittee was working in the light.
There are many who thmK as Judge
Yule thinks, but who have not the cour- j
*ige to express their thoughts. If the i
rich men of Oakland, and there are many I
of them, .--.-â  fact that they have j
practically nothing to call attention to
their generosity, had done their duty, j
there would have been no shadow of |
foundation for doing what politicians j
would call "pulling- the leg" of Mr. Car- j
negle. His gift is rather embarrassing!
Than otherwise. It is not to be supposed,
judging fr'-.m a letter accompanying it.
that he wishes his $50,000 to be a nucleus
of a building fund, but rather that he in
lends that the whole building shall be i
erected with his coin and that his money ;
shall be Identified with It. The American-
Scotchman's gift will not provide a library ;
â whi.-h will b<_- a credit to this city, or
whleh will supply its demands ten years
hence.
Mr. Carnegie's gift would be put to good
use if it were to build a few fref reading
rooms in the suburbs of Oakland, leaving
to its citizens the duty of providing a free
public library that will be adequate to j
Oakland's need certainly for the whole of;
tlip next generation.
Robert Fitzgerald is undoubtedly a good
Democrat and an anti-monopolist. But j
he is intensely human. A few days ago ;
the Acme Club went out of existence and j
the Reliance Club, of which Mr. Fitzger- j
aid Is president, was considerably
strengthened thereby. It has been cus- j
tomary for the two clubs 0 give Intersc-t
--ing boxing exhibits about or.cc a month. \
These shows could be witnessed for a dot- j
lar. The membership fees of the Reliance
are two and a hair times this amount, '
and many "lovers of sport" who only I
â¢wished to see the boxing, withdrew from i
membership and paid their dollar for each I
tight; thus saving a dollar and a half per
nil. mh.
As sr lO n as the lance found that it 'â 
had a monopoly of these boxing entertain- '
ments, Mr. Fitzgerald, in a moment oft
confidence, said to me; "Now we have the
thing in our own hands, and these sup
posed lovers of sport who have been mean
enough to take advantage of the dollar ]
rate, may now find that we charge twice j
that amount for our exhibitions, having i
so much larger membership than former- ;
ly we can depend on a larger attendance of
our own members, and outsiders who j
wish to patronize our shows will have to i
pay."
The skirmishing at the City Hall this
week has le&ulted with even honors for J
all concerned. Mr. Barstow scored once |
on Monday night, when he ailed the i
incident six years ago of his being sole j
opponent to the Pardee amendments to
the charter. A little later the opponents
of the Mayor made a point by discovering
and exploiting the fact that he had
â¢ barged '.he city with a little dinner for
the Coun-.ilmen which was given before us â 
wsy? Mayor.
So long as so much had been made of '
this little bill Ithink It but rignt that 'â 
another Â»ct of the Mayor's which was j
brought out by this same Incident, should
be made equally prominent. Some time ;
ago a police ofjlcer found himself in a i
tough crowd, and used his club rather I
freely on one of its members. The victim j
of the club is not an unfamiliar figure ;
In the Police Court, but on this occasion j
he put on enough testimony to prove tt;at â 
he was lilt harder than there was any j
necessity tor. This resulted in the officer
having to pay 150 damages. Mayor Snow I
need not have paid any attention to the I
verdict against the officer. But. believing .
that the pence guardian considered ho was '
doing his duly, he at once drew a warrant :
fur the full amount and charged it to lh* \
fund which the charter places at the â 
private disposal of the Mayor, giving no :
one the authority to ask a single question â¢
regarding its expenditure. There Is noth- \
Ing in the records to show that any other
Mayor did any such graceful or sensible
act with the urgent â¢â â¢ -sit;,- fund. Had
Mr. Snow draw a blank warrant on the i
fund for this amount and put it in his i
pocket, as many Mayors have done. I
there would not have been a word said. J
With the exceptions of Mr. Snow and Mr. j
Pardpe there has been, perhaps, no Mayor ]
of Oakland who has made any pretense i
of showing how this secret fund has been j
spent.
It is not likdy that there will be r.ny
more little dinners among the Council- !
m^n. Since the last social meal, which I
was held at Mr. Howe's house, i here have
been maty turns <if the political wheel. !
No longer can ::ny member depend on I
eight or nine votes, and nearly every I
("ouncilm in will go outside of the leading!
strings at times. Mr. !:â â¢.-.<â . who, when
he introduced bis new charter moveme.it
c"Ulr) have relied on more than a majority,
found himself the other night In a hope
less minority, while Mr. i uv< iller has to
'.hank sentiment more than anything rise
tor receiving .such large votes sustaining !
?very effort b<- makes to further his i
rchome for obtaining a municipal water !
plant.
Recently a proposition was made to i
iave another" little dinner" by a member '
of the city government; but his best ,-,,]. |
visers frowned bo darkly (in the ugges- j
tion that it came to naught.
Congressman Metcalf and Senator Per
kins will leave shortly for Washington, |
and a lar?e portion of the documents tnat |
they will carry with them relate to the. j
harbor and the contemplated Improve- | '
ITK-nts. it now scorns as If all the old j
straw was to be thrashed over again. The 'â 
same old struggle has been revived. Oak- !
land wants a harbor for the purpose of >
commerce; Alamcda wants a tidal canal i '
so that tier sanitary conditions may be I
improved. The arguments put forward
by Oakland merchants would convince
anybody that their proposition Is abso
lutely incontrovertible and that there Is
nut the slightest merit in the claim of Ala
meda until the arguments from the other
Fide of the < si nary are read, and then It
is hard to believe that Oakland has any
Halm whatever on the Government until j
the tidal canal baa been completed. :
This was the state of the controversy :
ten years ago and It is the same to-day,
and, from appearances. It will not be Im
proved after Congress haa met and ad
journed unless something very practicable
be done.

DESPERATE JAPANESE.
He Attempts to Hold Up an Officer at
the Point of a Gun.
A.LAMEDA. Oct. 29.- T. Kekkuchl. a
Japanese, was arrested this afternoon
by Officer Lawrence at the foot of Ninth
street. A charge of disturbing the peace ,
and one for discharging firearms within |
the city limits have been placed against
him. These will probably be followed
by a felony charge.
Complaint was made to the police that
some one was discharging firearms along
the beach In the vicinity of Ninth street. i
Officer Lawrence discovered Kekkuchi
shooting birds. The officer walked to
within a few feet of the. hnnter, and,
after showing him his star told him that |
he was under arrest and asked him to i
accompany him. The Jap refused to go,
and leveling his shotgun at the officer
told him that if he attempted to take
him he would shoot. Lawrence grabbed \
the barrel of the gun, and turning It j
from him made an attempt to gel hold ;
vi ills man. A struggle for supremacy
ensued: Lawrence got hold of the Jap s j
neck and attempted to throw him. The ;
Jap, however, was a good wrestler, and
getting hold of the officer's legs he pro
ceeded to make things lively for him. â¢
Lawrence dealt the Japanese a blow In
the [ace with his fist and downed him. j
He lost no time after that In placing .
the handcuffs on his prisoner and took |
him to the City Prison. ;

THE SAN FB AS CISCO CALL, MONDAY, OCTOBER 30, 1899.
ELDERLY WOMAN
TAKES DOSE OF
CARBOLIC ACID
Mrs. Benttey Tires of
Life.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
Broadway, Oct. 29.
Mrs. Louise C. Bentley, aged 50 years,
wea a dose of carbolic acid this
while apparently temporarily
i:is:iic' from long brooding over the loss
ef her husband, who died here in 1592.
Mrs. Bentley has had charge of the
lodging rooms at P2o Hroadway for the
I hree years or more as assistant to
Mrs. M Jones, who conducts the Windsor
Hotel '>n Washington street. She ap
peared to be in n happy frame of mind
early this afternoon and at 3 o'clock was
joking with George E. Robinson, a
roomer. Robinson, who Is 2u years old,
and several companions of the same age
about to go out to dinner, and she
had remarked jocosely that she would
go, too. When Robinson and his friends
ed nearly an hour later they found
his room Locked from the inside. Gaining
access through an adjoining room they
horrified to and their landlady on
the floor dying, with a bottle close by
that had contained carbolic acid. Fully
twenty minutes passed before the police
â â . gon could be had, it being out
on another
Sventually the dying woman was
tnken to the Receiving Hospital, where
Its. Btratton, r"orter and Rowe worked
hard for several hours to revive her, but
from tho rlrst the physicians gave very
little hope. Late to-night Mrs. Bentley
showed strong signs of rallying.
William Bentley, the woman's son, who
was a volunteer In the Eighth Regiment,
was Immediately notjlied of his mother's
condition. He was at a loss to give any
reason for her act except that she had
â  d too much over her husband's
death.
"I saw my mother early this after
noon," he said, "and at that time she
seemed tat her cheerful. I have always
done everything in my power for my
mother. I nad been working on the Santa
Fe construction, near Martinez, and re
turned a week ago last Friday, when I
gave her $100."
Some of the roomers assert that there
had been trouble between Mrs. Bentley
and her employer. According to young
son, Mrs. Bentley some time ago
l to him troubles she claimed to \
have had with Mrs. Jones, and on that
occasion she asked him for a revoKer
with which to end her misery.

particularly of the people of the Islands.

DR, DILLE GIVES
HIS OPINION OF
B. FAY MILLS
Discusses the Latter's
"Change of Front."
Oakland Office Ran Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, Oct. -â '.
"Rev. B. Fay Mills' Change, of Front"
was the topic of Rev. Dr. E. H. DHle'fl
discourse to-night at the First M. K.
Church, and at the outset Dr. DUle as
serted that he proposed not to discuss
Rev. Mr. Mills In a controversial spirit.
"I take you to witness," said Dr. DIUo,
"that it is my practice in my preaching
to deal with 'isms' and not with Msts";
with principles and not with persons."'
He then reviewed some of the utterances
of the noted Unitarian divine lately fr.>m
| Boston, touching briefly upon Mills' evan
i gellcal work here b;ick in 1892, at which
I time Rev. Mr. Mills had been invited by
i the clergy of the evangelical churches to
conduct services, and the subsequent
erection of the Mills Tabernacle at a
great expense.
"After Mr. Mills left hero," continued
Dr. Dille, "he continued his evangelistic
work for a while, but gradually withdrew
from It and began preaching upon su
! clologlcal, political and other secular
themes, avowing that his conception of
the Gospel was that it Is to regenerate
society rather than to regenerate individ
uals. 11. j became pastor of a church In
; Albany, N. V., and his failure there did
not tend to sweeten his temper, never of
the sweeti I li Â«' â  ase his love for
I the churchi s, with which he declarers he
â  had then broken In belief, though he was
| still eating their bread and holding their
i credentials.
"From thai time his discourses became
largely diatribes against the established
! social' order and i specially againr-t the
evangelical church. Finally he came out
j boldly and repudiated the fundamental
i principles of orth id \y md avowed hlm-
I self a liberal. But whal of it? Has not a
man a right to change his religious ppln
, lons and convictions, and having done so,
! must he not be- true to these new convic
: tions? By all means, and not one t^prd
of this sermon would have been spoken if
Milis had not Introduced his ministry of
sweetness and light in Oakland by nrlng
lng railing accusations against his former
brethren.
"He says that he has ceased to believe
in salvation by Â«'hrtst alone, and yet at
St Paul In 1893. he says; 'An unbelieving
heart is not right in the sight of God;
that is, the heart that dots not believe
that Jesus Christ, the son, is sufficient to
"1 have no controversy with the Uni
tarians for I have among them many
warm personal friends. But the truth is
that the Unitarian church Is a dissolving
view; and yet some "t' its prophets are
always telling us to stand from under be
fore 'the orthodox churches come tum
-1 bllng about our ears. It is almost funny
to see these gentlemen stand in the center
of a dissolving view while they shake a
, monitory finger at orthodoxy, and cry:
'Mene, mene, tekel upharsln.'
Rev. B. Fay Mills spoke on "The Germs
. of a Greater Religion" at the First Uni
tarian Church to-day and again every
seat was occupied. Rev. Mr. Mills is mo
mentarily expecting news from Boston as
to whether arrangements can be made to
allow him to continue preaching here. It
is the general impression that he will re
main here. _^
BISHOP MORELAND FILLSJ
THE PULPIT AT TRINITY
Rl=hop Moreland occupied the pulpit at
Trinity Church yesterday at both the
morning and afternoon services. The edi
lice was crowded in the morning to hear
the eloquent preacher. Bishop Moreland
took his text from Acts, xv:ls. "They
brought tho sick into the streets on beds
and couches, that at least the shadow of
Peter passing by, might overshadow some
of them." The spt&ker described the cir
cumstances of the st.>ry, St. Peter, full of
the spirit of Christ, going among the sick
and on whomsoever his shadow fell, he
was healed. He said:
"Every one has a shadow which is in
separable from him. You have ;i cm-
BClous Influence, but you have also an un
i loUS influence, which goes about
with you like a shadow and falls o n your
fellow men. Fou may assume virtues and
graces which y..u do not possess in order
to make an impression, but there is an
atmosphere going with you, a telltale
shadow which reveals you to others, it
Is with you everywhere, even at the very
altar of God."
FATHER DAMIEN'S HEROISM
AMONG LEPERS EXTOLLED
Rev. D. C. Garrett delivered last night
at St. Luke's Church an interesting his
torical sermon on the subject of Father
Damien and his work in the leper settle
ment on the island of Molokai, in the
Hawaiian group. He told the story of the
early life and training of the noble priest
and of his final determination to make
the leper settlement the scene of his life
work. The speaker described the settle
ment and told of the many years of toil
of Father Damien. He said In part:
After living for ten yean with the lepers.
Father Damien began to suspect that he
had contracted the loathsome disease. The
doctors at first assured him that such was
not the case, but Anally were obliged to
confess the truth. Three weeks before his
death, the disease Increased terribly on his
face and hands. So ended this noble life.
He conquered death.
"Here the rocks and shoals and quick
sands;
Here the grave beneath the sod;
There the haven where we will be

SUN YOU STILL FREE.
Detective Ed Gibson Returns From
Placer County Without His
Prisoner.
A little more than a week ago pretty
Sun You fled from the protection of Loo
Son, a Chinese merchant and a member
of the Six Companies. It is intimated
that she was not alone in her flight, but
that she was accompanied by a young
Chinese gallant, who had supplanted the
wealthy merchant In her affections. Loo
Son did not propose to be trilled with in
this manner, however, without an effort
to get even. Besides. Sun You carried
away with her several valuable dresses
and some costly Jewelry, which he
claimed belonged to him. Consequently
Loo Son proceeded to swear, to a com
plaint charging Sun You with grand lar
ceny A warrant for her arrest was is
sued and placed in the hands of Detec
tive Ed Gibson.
Gibson located the Chinese beauty In
Auburn. Placer County, and left bore last
Thursday for the purpose of taking her
Into custody. The arrest was made all
right, but the girl was among friends and
within a few hours she was again at lib
erty on an order of discharge signed by
Judge Wells of Placer County.
Gibson returned to San Francisco last
evening with the Judge s order in lieu of
the prisoner. Judge Graham counter
signed the order, and now Loo Son must
evolve some other scheme to get even
with the betrayer of his love and confi
dence.

SPIRITS TOLD
HIM TO WED A
BLONDE WIDOW
He Chose Mrs. Judge
Campbell.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Oct. 29.
Mrs. C. E. Campbell, widow of the late j
Judge Campbell of San Francisco, created ;
a mild sensation hero, this afternoon by
reporting to the police and Sheriff that
her life was in danger and demanding
that Joe, a Portuguese whose other name
is said to be Fenera. who has been occu
pying the barn In the rear of the Carap
l'U premises, corner of Wheeler street
and Ashby avenue, Berkeley, be arrested J
f<>r insanity.
"The man declares that spirits have
told him he is to marry me," said Mrs.
Campbell at the County Jail. "He has
secured Judge Campbell's big revolver â¢
and threatens my life. He says if I don't ;
marry him I'll be eorry. He was em
ployed to help about the place on several
occasions some months ayn.
this little bill 1 think it but right that
"I first became alarmed one day wtien
J found him upstairs in my home. He >
called me, saying he wanted to ->how me !
something. 1 went into the room where
he was and he quickly bolted the door. I j
Bcreamed ar,d he let me out and told me j
I'd be sorry.
"When we vacated the Berkeley place
last August he helped us move the fur- ,
nitiire, and he has been occupying the ;
barn ever since.
"Yesterday 1 got word that Joe was
tearing down the fence and pulling up the I
wooden walks and burning them, so 1
came over to-day to gee about it. Then
he told me it was no use, I'd have to |
marry him; that spirits and God and even â 
the Judgo, my dead husband, had ap- \
peared before him and told him I would
have to marry him. He said the spirits â¢
had told him a blonde widow would set
him up in business. 1 am afraid he may ,
set fire to my house next. I am alrald
that if he is not committed to an asylum
he will kill me. He is a very powerful
man and claims to have been a prize- |
lighter once."
Deputy Sheriffs Taylor and Striker were
detailed to arrest the Portuguese and
bring him to the receiving hospital. They
found Fenera in the barn and they say
he offered no resistance when told of the
Import of their mission, but declared he
was certainly as sane as anybody and
that he had had no trouble with Mr?
Campbell. He admitted he had broached
the subject of matrimony to her, but de
clared that she had led him to believe >
she cared a good deal for him. He also j
admitted that he believed in spiritualism
to a certain extent, but he was so calm ;
and composed throughout the visit of ihe ;
officers that they concluded not to arrest i
him and left satisfied with the promise |
that the man would appear at the County
Jail at 9 o'clock to-morrow morning to
answer any charge Mrs. Campbell might
prefer. ,
THREE NEW STEAMERS
FOR AUSTRALIAN TRADE
OCEANIC LINE TO HAVE THE
BEST COAST SHIPS.
Consul George W. Bell, en Koute to
Sydney, Tells of the Vessels
Cramp Is Now Building.
George W. Bel!, Consul for the United
States to Sydney, N. S. \\\, is at the Oc
cidental en route to his post In the an
tipodes. When the merchants of Aus
tralia decided to send some one to repre
sent them at the Export Exposition luw
ly held In Philadelphia, they chose as
their representative Mr. Bell, notwith-
Btanding the f;ict that he was a foreigner
ami an official oÂ£ another country. As far
as [8 known this is the first time that a
consular officer has been made the re
cipient of such a distinctive compliment
from the people to whom tie was ac
credited.
Mr. Hell has been to Philadelphia, and,
havingVtransacted with honor to himself
and tne people who reposed their trust
in him the duties he was sent to perform,
in now on his way to his home acrosj the
Pacific.
U liile in Philadelphia Mr. Bell visited
the Cramps' shipyards and inspected the
three new steamers now being built there
for the Oceanic Steamship Company,
which will put them on the line from tins
city to Australia.
;\"ir. liiii says that in speaking of these
vessels Mr. Cramp told him that they
were the equal of any ships of their
class now afloat and vastly superior to
anything now "ii the waters of the Pa
cific Ocean. r l hey are large, roomy,
comfortable, and combine every modern
device for safety, with engines capable
of driving them at a speed fully two
knots faster than any steamer now run
ning out of San Francisco. The lirst of
these magnificent ships will be com
pleted about the first of next May and
the other two will follow at intervals of
a couple of months.
Mr. Bell is of tne opinion that these
new ships will uo much to increase the
traffic between this country and Aus
tralia, and will prove of great benefit
nut only to their owners but to the mer
cantile interests of San Francisco.
On Tuesday afternoon next Mr. Bell
will speak before the local Chamber of
Commerce and give that body the benefit
of his knowledge of mercantile affairs,
particularly stub as pertain to Australia
and otner countries beyond the seas.
"B ROWN'S IN
TOWN" IS A
DISTINCT HOT.
A farce comedy with a good plot is one
of the rarest literary achievements of the
century, and it becomes a source of thor
uii^h enjoyment when one is lucky enough
to discover such a thing on the horizon
of tiie modern stage. Such a dramatic
Visitor made Its appearance at the Cali
fornia Theater last evening, which in
honor of this auspicious occasion was
packed from parquet to gallery. "Brown's
in Town" Is the cleverest play that has
struck this town for a lone, while, and
Mark B. Swan, its author, deserves to be
congratulated upon this child Â« Â»i his brain.
The comedj turns Itself around a young
wedded couple, who In their ondeavor to
keep their marriage from the husband's
father entangle themselves in a net of
fibs which Causes a series of situations
Ihe humor of which is extremely healthy.
The beauty of the play is that it is snappy
and the audience meets with surprises
until the curtain drops after the last act.
The jokes are all clever and new. The
performers are particularly bright. Mis?
Knowlton is very chic. Jessie May Hail is
a very captivating smihrette and sings
exceedingly well and Fanny Midgely im
personatca a colored cook most delight
fully. Equally successful is the German
character work >>f Monica Lee. Among
the gentlemen Charles Horn does splen
did character work as the bewildered
father. The play made a decided hit and
will no doubt draw large houses.
AT.FIiP;i> MKTZGER.

The teamsters on the water front are \
in a quandary. They cannot keep up with
their work and the hordes are beginning j
to show marked Bigns of the wear and .
tear. The drivers and animals are kept |
at work from early in the morning until I
11 or 12 o'clock at night and all day Sun- j
day. Yesterday there was a continuous
procession of heavy trucks along East j
street, while the Oceanic ami Government
wharves and the Pacific Mail dock were ;
as busy as on a week day.
"I don't know what we are going to
do," said the manager of one of the dray
age companies yesterday. "The growth
of trade lias been something enorn
We are going morning, noon and night I
and cannot catch up. Our horses are
breaking down under tlie continuous â¢
work and new animals to take their
places are very hard to get. Good drlv- ]
ers are also scarce and in consequence '
the horses don't get all th<= care and at- i
tention t_ej should, considering the work
they have i" do. I have never seen busi
ness Increase with such rapid bounds in
all my life and it Is still growing. U
we can all double our plants before ;
Christmas we shall simply be swamped,
as we cannot handle the business that is ;
offering at the present time."
Nearly all the vessels bought by the j
Mighell syndicate from Flint & Co. are j
under charter to carry sugar from Ha- â 
waii to New York or Philadelphia. The \
May Flint goei then from Hongkong, the
Henry B. Hyde from Norfolk, Va.; the!

tolus from Nanaimo, B. C; the John Me-
Donald from Hongkong; the R. D. Rice

here from Philadelphia and then goes to
Honolulu and the A. J. Fuller goes from
Philadelphia to Japan and thence to Ha- j
waii. The St. James sails from Hong- j
kong to New York and the St. David from
Hongkong to Baltimore.
The little San Salvadorean steamer
Matile has not been heard from since she ;
left here on September 30 last for X!
Triumfo, via Sau Diego. Sh< came up
from Acajutla with a cargo of logs in
fourteen lavs, and El Triumfo is only |
about eighty miles further south. The
agents of the vessel say that Captain i
Medena changed his mind about calling |
at San Diego and went direct to El Tri- :
umfo. He should have arrived at his
destination long ago and may have done
so, the fact not having been telegraphed
here.
There has been a great scarcity of flour
in Guatemala, and in order to get a sup
pi v into the country the Government re- j
moved the duty during the month ef Oc- ;
tcber. The Maule was sent up here and
was loaded with the article. The Maule
was built in Port Glasgow in 1885 and was ;
formerly in the South American trade.
About six months ago she was bought by j
some people In San Salvador to carry
merchandise to the Mail steamers at an
chor In the roadsteds Her visit in Sep- j
tember was the tirst she had made to San i
Francisco.
The steamer Queen arrived from Puget
Sound ports yesterday. Am. nig her pas

Ing from Cape Nome. All of them bring
home more or less gold and say they are I
going back m the spring. The yucen ;
briugs word that the steamer Aloha had
a terrible time on the way up. She was
on her beam ends for about sixteen hours
and everybody aboard made sure the ves
sel would go down. The deck loan was
cur away and some of the cargo jetti- j
Boned, after which the vessel can:.- up "ii
an even keel. She reached (/ape Nome |
in safety after that and the balance of I
the cargo was landed.
The l.oat race between two crews from |
the battleship lowa did not take place;
yesterday. Captain Goodrich was to have i
"been referee, but could not attend to the i
duties owing to h previous engagement,
so the men postponed the race until to- j
day. As the cutters are not evenly
matched the men are going to row In the
whaleboats. There will be twelve men
and n. cockswain in each boat. The crew
from the second division will be cock

PRISONER ATTEMPTS
TO COMMIT SUICIDE
Fred Lederer, Confined in the Wood
land Jail, Inflicts Several Ugly-
Wounds on Himself.
WOODLAND, Oct. Fred Lederer,
| who tried to butcher his wife a few
months ago and Is now in jail awaiting
i trial, attempted to commit suicide while
alone in his cell yesterday morning. When
found he was shamming unconsciousness
and his cell and the corridor nearby pre
sented a ghastly spectacle.
Lederer was found in the north corridor
of the fall. There was an ugly gash
I across the fleshy part of the left arm, but
: it was confined to the anterior surface
'. and lacked an Inch and a half of reaching
|an artery. There was also a cut above
1 both ankles and a cut above the left knee,
| but none of these wounds reached an
I artery.
The instrument -with which the wounds
| were; inflicted has not yet been found. The
; cell and corridors have been thoroughly
I searched, without dlscoverying a trace of

TWO BEERS MAY
SET MEN FREE
Jurymen Charged With
Grave Misconduct.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN RAFAEL, Oct. 29.â Two large
schooners of beer, surmounted by the
frothy foam so conclusively proving to
the expert eye that the"barkeep" under
stands his business to a nicety, will
probably be responsible for the reversal
of a jury decision forming the first ca.so
on record where Chinese were convicted
in Marin County fo.- illegal fishing. It is
alleged that two of the Jurymen entered
! a saloon and satisfied their thirst for the
â  amber liquid after they had been charged
i by the Justice and placed in the custody
|of a Constable. Accordingly Judge An
gellotti will be petitioned to set aside the
verdict on the ground of misconduct.
During the last few months sixty Chi
nese in all have been arrested for illegal
fishing at Point San Pedro. They have
j been tried in companines of five in the
j various Justice's courts of the county. At
| torneys Sylva of Sausallto and Boyd of
San Rafael always appearing for the de
fense. Jury trials have unfailingly re
sulted in acquittals until last Wednesday,
â when five Chinese were tried at Novato
before Justice Dahl.
Tbie was Justice Dahl's first jury case,
and he was exceedingly careful to con
duct things according to Hoyle. When
the evidence was in for both sides the
Jury was charged and placed in the care
| of Constable De Voto, counsel adjourning
j to De Burba's saloon Tor refreshments,
iTo their surprise and bewilderment a
; juryman entered and queried: "Well,
i boys, ain't I in on this?"
The astute Sylva, seeing a chance for a
reversal in case of an unfavorable de-
I cision, nearly fell over himself in his
haste to throw more money on the coun
ter, and after partaking of a huge
"steam" the juryman returned to delib-
I crate with his confreres. Another Jury
i man repeated this performance in Dv-
I tro's saloon.
The jury brought in a verdict of guilty,
| whereupon papers were prepared, affida
vits of witnesses taken, and to-morrow
Judge Angellottl will be asked for a re
! versal on the ground of misconduct. Con
i stable De Voto is severely censured for
his laxity in permitting any of the jury
men out of his sight

SOUGHT DEATH
RATHER THAN
DISOWN WIFE
Motive for Rother's
Suicide.
WEDDING BROUGHT ILL-LUCK
TO SECUP.E A SITUATION, HE
CLAIMED HE WAS SINGLE.
Tli.is Misrepresentation, According
the Widow, Preyed Upon Him
Until He Sought Belief
in Death.
TTie â¢widow of Max Rother, who was
drowned Thursday night in the Sacra
mento River, la llrm in the belief that he
deliberately committed suicide because
he had been forced by circumstances to
disown her as his wife. Ac< ording to the
woman, who was a Mrs. Dane when sho
â¢wa.Â» married to him In June last at San
Jose, misfortune dogged her husband's
â¢h wedding. While, she
Bays, the parents of Rother ottered no
sitlon to the match, the father al
most immediately withdrew his assistance
to the son. This somewhat discouraged
the young man, but, being of a cheerful
disposition, he hoped for the best and
made efforts t-> secure employment. In
tills he was unsuccessful.
The condition of the finances of Mr. and
Mrs. Rother compelled the. wife to go to
work about a month ago as a chamber
maid In a lodging-house kept by Mr*.
Hurke, on Turk street. The labor proved
to be too severe and she- had to give up
the position two weeks ago. About the
fame time the husband was encouraged
to believe That he would be given employ
ment by r >r. Jaffe, who is engaged In the
wine business at Sacramento, and ..e left
for the capital city.
"I had never known him to be so cheer
ful as the day he went away,' said the
widow last evening. "I received a letter
from him last Wednesday In which he
': that, although he had not been
given the position he expected, he was
going to be given a trial. He said that
Jaffe would only employ single men and
that he had told him that he was not
marri<>d. He h;ul also requested his fam
ily to assert the same thing, no was re
-1 to furnish bonds, and in the appli
cation to the security company both he
tils father, ho he wrote, had asserted
that he was single. This seemed u> worry
him. and if there wi re really any n
for his ticking his life it was that he was
forced through his efforts to secure em
ployment to repudiate me.
"I am on the best of terms with his
family. We have never had a disagree
ment of any kind. No later than this
afternoon my husband's sisters visited me
r their sympathy."
The widow asserts that she had a pre
monition before her husband left for Sac
ramento that something would happen to

ThfÂ» Old People's Home, Pierce and
Pine streets, was the scene yesterday of
an extremely impressive service In mem
ory of the founder. Mrs. Metha Nelson,
and the builders â Charles and Mary
Crocker.
The board of trustee? was present and
the beautiful little chapel, hung with fes
toons of flowers and palm branr-hep. was
filled to overflowing with inmates and
friends. The service, largely a musical
one, was opened by the reading of the
twenty-third Psalm by the Rev. S. H.
Willey, D. D., of the Congregational
Church. Dr. Cherlngton of Plymouth

CURED BY CUTICURA
Ny little boy wag two years old when he
reached upon the table and spilled a cup of
hot coffee all over his left hand. It had gone
through to his breast, and before I could re-
move his clothes it had burned his breast,
and the skin came oS with the clothes, and
he has to-day a scar as large as a silver dollar
on his breast. I applied a great many things.
The burn was a very ugly one, hard to heal.
I was requested to try Cuticcra (ointment),
which healed up rapidly, but before I used a
half a box of Cuticcra it was well. Oh, I
think Cuticcba is the salve above all others.

OLYMPICS MADE MERRY
REGARDLESS OF RAIN
A I/THOUGH plates floated
around the table and the
bread was soppy from falling
rain, the members of the
Olympic Club had a glorious
time yesterday on their annual out
inig at Escalles, Marin County. More
than 200 members of the winged "O"
and their Invited guests partook of a
royal feast under the protecting roof
of a wide veranda, saw some excit
ing foot racing and enjoyed a fine
programme of song and story. The
heavy downpour did not dampen the
spirits of the clubmen, who made
merry from the time of their arrival
shortly before noon until they de
parted for home.

the day and Mitchell sprang ashore
and notified Fred Butz that the com
modore had discovered rain in his vi
cinity, and that it would likely de
scend on them within a short time.
Butz thereupon marshaled his aids
and they soon had the races under
way, himself acting as starter, using
a small howitzer for the occasion,
and "Jack" Cunningham, J. K. Bock
man and John A. Hammersmith acted
as clerk of course and judges, respec

The first event was a 75-yard dash
and brought out four contestants.
All who entered, with the exception
of one, were arrayed in regulation

PRETTY SUNDAY WEDDING.
Miss Keene Becomes the Bride of A.

A very pretty little wedding took place i
last evening In the parlors of tho Cali
fornia Hotel, when Miss Keene, daughter
of the late Major C. C. Keono of tho Na
tional Guard of California, was made tho
wife of A. Jonas, a prominent merchant of
this city.
Both parties are well known among; tho
local society people and tho Qower-bje
df-cked parlors were crowded to their ut
most capacity with the friends and well
wishers who had gathered, despite tho
rain, to bid bon voyage to tho couple
about to embark on the phip of matri
mony.
Rabbi M. S. Levy tied the knot, and
after the ceremony a delirious wedding
supper was served, at which all present
sat down, toasting: the bride and groom.

BRILLIANT COMPOSER'S
DEBUT IN THIS CITY
DURING last February younicH
man arrived hero from Italy mil
a visit to relatives. Being .-Linu-M
sjcian he naturally cultivated t.';.-H
company of our musical people a:>>il
soon it became known that he h.-uIH
with him a grand opera which had ro-H
celved the first prize in a com petition!
for operatic works in Vienna. ThiÂ«M
young man was Glacomo Minkowsky, M
who desired to bring out his workH
during his San Francisco visa. i'>-H
nally Edward Xavier Rolker, one nfH
San Francisco's most prominent musi-H
clans, arranged a reception to whii-hH
he invited prominent musical pr-oplcH
and critics. At this reception Min-H
kowsky's opera received Its first .it-H
ing in America.- But the effect wasM
not the desired â â¢ one. for while alll
were lavish in their praise the follow-H
ing morning they seemed to have f.ir-H
gotten Minkowsky and his opera.
So the work was once more she|ved,H
until ' one day two local musicalH
critic? mot Minkowsky at' the of-H
flee of 11. M. I '.os worth cxplaln-M
Ing energetically why his opera shotildH
he brought out by the press. T!>><H
pleadings of the young man were ''H
earnest and upon examination thr>H
score at th" opera was found so meri-B
torious that it was decided to v'^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^l
Minkowsky a chance. About this time the Bostonlans arrived in San
Francisco, and naturally their attention was attracted to this work. The
result was a flattering offer from the Bostonlans to produce the opera.
The opera is entitled. "The Smugglers of Ba'dayez," and had Its first pro
duction in Waterbury. Conn., a town' of about 50.000 inhabitants, October 19
where it made such a tremendous hit that the New York morning papers of
October 20 contained press dispatches of the event, telling In flashing head
lines the great triumph of the composer. According to these dispatches the
audience, which packed the theater on that night, was wild with enthusiasm
and encored again and again almost every number. The intermezzo between
acts 1 and 2 created a perfect sensation and the composer was called twelve
times before the curtain. The opera will be produced at the Columbia next
spring.
It may be Interesting to add that Mr. Mlnkowsky will wed a San Fran
cisco girl. The engagement between Miss Wanda Galand and the young com
poser whose name will soon be known all over the music world has been an
nounced. Judging from the success of his opera Mlnkowsky will ere long be
classed among the famous musicians.

DONNELLY IS
DELIGHTED WITH
SAN FRANCISCO
Says Chinatown Is Its
Only Blot.
S.imiK-l R Donnelly, president of the
International Typographical I'nion, who
is m;ikinp an official tour of the cities on
the Pacific coast, will depart thfe after
noon for Stockton, after spending two
weeks in San Francisco. From Stockton
he will go to Sacramento, and thence to
Seattlp and over one of .he Northern
roads to Indianapolis.
President Donnelly's visit to the coast
was for the purpose of promoting the in
terests of unionism in this section of the
country and incidentally to endeavor to
straishten out the differences existing be
tween the Job printers and their employ
ers In this city. He is well pleased with
the results of his visit. .iltlmuKh his ef
forts to commit the boss printers to his
way of thinking have not been altogether
bui cessful.
"The 1"..->k and job printing trades are
demoralized in San Francisco at the pres
ent tlni"." said President Donnelly "as
the result of tho strik<\ Hut there is ap
parent a decided tendency to let bygones
be bygones, and I am confident that in
the near future conditions will he greatly

"Billy" Kennedy, former superin

ance late in the afternoon and was
given a warm welcome. "Billy" was
so flustered by the reception that he
kept pulling out his new stop-watch
and gazing on the inscription en-"
graved on an inner case. "Put" Jack

friends filled with pie and red wine
and won their everlasting gratitude.
The outing was arranged by George

Butz, James Coffroth and John Cun
ningham.
a day's work during the succeeding- year
and thereafter nine hours were to con
stitute a working day In the printing
trades. This agre< rnent was violated by
the Typothetae of San Francisco al
though the Typographical Union has
strictly observed It. I have had numerous
conferences with the employing book and
job printers since I arrived In San Fran
cisco, hm 1 have been unable to accom
plish anything Important. However, I
believe that the employers will soon
make of thr-lr own volition the conces
sions asked for by the printers."
President Donnelly visited San Diego
and the principal cities in the Southern
part of he State before coming to San
Francisco, and he expressed himself as
delighted with California.
"This is my first visit to the coast." ho
said, "and I think the climate is perfect
absolutely perfect."
During his stay in Snn Francisco Mr.
Donnelly has been the recipient of- many
attentions from members of the local
Typographical Union, lif was taken or
a drive through the park and out to the
Miff House soon after his arrival by -\n

President r;ibb. Joseph A. Premiss and
others, and. to cap it all. has been
through Chinatown under the guidance of
Officer Burke. All this has given Mr.
| Donnelly a very healthy conception of
San Francisco's hospitality, but the
Chinatown trip proved almost too much
for his stomach.
"Chinatown is a Blthy place." he de
clared. "It Is disgustingly filthy, and the
Board of Health should have its attention
called to it. There is probably as much
vice among the Chinese of \\\v York as
; among the San Francisco Chinese, but in
New York the vice Is gilded, while here
its vileness is exposed to the public view
clothed only in rags and filth. You should
turn the hose on Chinatown."
Mr. Donnelly presided at the regular
meeting of the local Typographical Union
yesterday afternoon in Pythian Castle
During tho session he made a brief ad
dress on the subject of unionism, his re
marks being enthusiastically applauded.

FATAL SMASHUP
The Davis and Whittle
Families Injured.
â â¦
THROWN ON RAILROAD TRACK
YOUNG ALFRED WHITTLE COOL
LY FLAGS THE TRAIN.
â¦
C. L. Davis and A. M. Whittle, With
Their Families, Hurled From a
High Grade in Mill
Valley. .
The courage and presence of mind dis
played yesterday by 12-year-old Alfred
Whittle, son of A. L. Whittle, paying tel
ler of the San Francisco Savings L'nion,
averted a fearful accident on the line of
the Mt. Tamalpais Scenic Railway to a
party from this city. Before he had an
opportunity, however, to display his hero
ism, the party, consisting of Charles I^.
Davis, receiving teller of the San Francis
co Savings Union, Mrs. Davis, Mr. and
Mrs. Whittle, the boy's parents, and his
two sisters, Bessie and Grace, had been
precipitated from a bus over a ten-foot
embankment onto the tracks.
All heard the whistle of an approaching
train, but with the exception of the boy
they either had not the presence of mind
or were so pinned down that they could
not get out of the overturned bus. The
heroism of young Whipple grew with the
proximity of the danger. He extricated
himself from the wreck and without a
moment's hesitation ran as fast as he
could up the track and nagged the train
witli his coat. Engineer Johnson shut
down the brakes and stopped the train
before it reached the scene of the smash
up. The two families were taken aboard
and transferred to the local line.
Mr. and Mrs. Davis and Mr. and Mrs.
Whittle, with their three children, were
visiting at the cottage of Robert Parsons
in Mill Valley. They took a bus, driven
by one McCarthy, with the intention of
catching the- 2:15 train to this city. As
the vehicle was going down a steep grade
the. team, for some reason, became un
manageable, and taking fnghL dashed
down the grade at a furious rate. Reach-
Ing a sudden turn, the bus was burled
over an embankment. The traces broke
and the liberated horses ran away.
When lie was picked up it was discov
ered that Mr. Davis was the worst in
jured. His left arm above the elbow was
broken and he is now suffering from the
shock as is also his wife. Mrs. Whittle
is a severe sufferer. She sustained a
sprained wrist, numerous bodily bruises
ami a great shock to her nervous system.
Her husband and the children. Urace,
aged 14; Albert, aged 12. and iiessie, aged
9 escaped without a scratch.
'"My husband and Mr. Whittle are em
ployed in the same bank," said -Irs.
Davis relating the story of the ride. "10
--day we all went over to Mill Valley to
look at some property. We intended stay-
Ing at Mr. Parsons' all day, but the rain
coming on, we decided to return to the
city When we got into the bus, I cau
tioned the driver to go slowly, as I ap
preciated the condition of the road. He
was either intoxicated, or out of pure
wantonness drove his horses toward the
station at high speed.
"The tracts broke and the liberated
horses ran away. I was on the side of the
bus that careened and was thrown on my
head My husband sustained a broken
arm but managed to aid me to climb out
from among the debris. Mr. Whittle and
the three children were uninjured, but
Mrs Whittle was pinioned under the
broken wagon. The little boy, Albert,
acted the hero. Seeing the danger his
mother was In, he rushed up the track
and flagged the train which was coming at
that moment. Fortunately for Mrs.
Whittle, she was lying outside the track,
as when the train moved slowly forward
I and pushed the destroyed vehicle out of
| its path she was not touched. We then
boarded the train and came to the city.
While waiting for the train to start the
driver of the bus, evidently sobered by
the accident, came into the car and swore
to us that It was not his fault. I came to
San Francisco without my hat, and Mr.
Davis was unable to secure medical treat
ment until he arrived home."
Driver McCarthy says he is unable to
understand why no one was killed. He
denies that the accident was in any way
due to his fault.
WILL SUE THE MAYOR.
Dunster's Death Is Charged to Phe-
lan's Neglect.
The death of John H. Dunster. who was
killed last Friday by the breaking of a
ladder on a building at Thirteenth and
Howard streets, may compel the Mayor
to mix law with politics, and stand a suit
for damages for criminal neglect.
Dunster was a carpenter ami had been
sent to fix the roof of the building,
which could be reached only by an im
provised ladder up the side of the house.
The ladder broke when Dunster was near
the top and he fell fifty feet to the
ground.
The building is owned by Mayor
Phefan, and at the inquest to be held at
the Morgue to-morrow morning Phelan
and his agent, K. D. McElroy, will be
the principal witnesses.
Dunster's death leaves a family of chil
dren dependent upon the oldest boy. for
the mother has been dead for some
years. The son was at the Morgue yes
terday, and he declared it to be his In
tention to bring suit against Phelan. as
he pays his father's death was due to
the rotten condition of the ladder, for
which condition Phelan was directly
responsible and of which he had had no
tice.
