WHEATON PURSUES AND
PUNISHES THE FILIPINOS,
KILLING TWO HUNDRED
MANILA. March 19, 6:20 p. m.â
Some of the rebels recently ex
pelled from Cavite and the
small towns in the vicinity of
Pasig combined forces and last
night attacked a company of the Wash
ington Volunteers about a mile and
a half southeast erf Pasig. General
Wheaton immediately reinforced the
Americans with two companies each of
the Washington and Oregon regiments.
The post had held the enemy in check
and the fire of the reinforcing compa
nies repulsed them, driving them across
to an island formed by the estuary.
They were thus in front of the Twenty
second regulars. j
Oa discovering that they wece en
trapped the rebels fought desperately,
aided materially by the jungle and the
darkness, but they were completely
routed, with heavy loss, after two
hours' fighting. The Americans lost two
killed and twenty wounded, among the
latter Lieutenant Frank Jones.
General Wheaton determined to pun
ish the natives and at daybreak to-day
his brigade started in the following or
der: The Sixth Artillery, holding the
extreme right; the Oregon Volunteers,
holding the center; the Washington
Regiment keeping to the edge of the
lake and the Twenty-second regulars
occupying the right of the line, which
swept the whole country along the lake
In a southeasterly direction, toward
General Ovenshine's position. The line
thus extended over two miles of coun
try, rough and covered with thick jun
gle, advanced eleven miles. The enemy
fled, the last of them being seen about
8:30 o'clock this afternoon. At scarcely
any time did the Americans get within
1200 yards of them.
The troops are returning to Pasig to
night, exhausted by the hard work un
der a hot sun. The Oregon Regiment
had one man killed and four wounded
and the Twenty-second regulars one
.wounded. According to the official re
ports no fewer than 200 Filipinos were
killed.
General Otis says the American army
and gunboats now command the lake.
He estimates that property of the in
surgents valued at $500,000 has been de
stroyed, while quantities of rice and
sugar and 400 tons of coal, which is
very valuable here, has been captured.
Many prisoners represent that the |
Filipino soldiers are weakening. The j
generous treatment that the Americans .
administer to the native prisoners and ;
wounded seemed to influence the in- i
eurgent army powerfully. In the opin
ion of the Americans, however, the
Filipino leaders will continue to pro
voke fighting just as long as they can
retain their hold upon their followers, j
because they have everything to gain j
and nothing to lose.
The enemy has twice as many men
on its firing line as it has arms,
and the fact that so few arms are cap

OTIS REPORTS ON
WHEATON'S WORK
WASHINGTON, March 19. â The War Department to-day received
the following dispatch from General Otis regarding operations
against the insurgents:
"MANILA, March 19.â T0 Adjutant General, Washington: Our
Improvised gunboats under Captain Grant, Utah Artillery, have full
possession of Laguna de Bai; troops, Inhabitants and property on
shore of lake at our mercy. Wheaton's brigade on Pasig River line
drove enemy northeast Into province of Morons:. Last w.-niiÂ»g
enemy attacked portion of his force south of Pasig, killing two men
and wounding twenty of the Twenty-second Infantry. This morn
ing Wheaton . moved against this insurgent force, driving it to the
south fifteen miles, experiencing very slight loss. Enemy left 200 dead
on field. OTIS."
tured by the Americans is because of
the guns of the wounded Filipinos and
many of those who surrender are spir
ited away.
The armed tugs Laguna de Bai and
Oeste have returned to "San Pedro
Macate and reported the results of
their tour of the lake. On Friday morn
ing last they shelled the town of Mo
ringi, the rebels fleeing without making
any resistance. The Americans landed
a party, which destroyed a quantity of
stores and all the store buildings ex
cept the church. The expedition then
proceeded to Majayguy, where a sugar
mill and sawmill were destroyed.
On arriving at Santa Cruz, a town of
1200 inhabitants, it was found that the
enemy was strongly . intrenched and
prepared to defend the position, as
sisted by two gunboats and several
launches. Moreover the mouth of the
river was blocked with rocks and bam
boo. A few shells caused an exodus of
the citizens, but not of the enemy's
troops. The Americans did not at
tempt a landing. Captain Grant, who is
in charge mf the expedition, asks for re
inforcements and will probably take
Santa Cruz to-morrow.
CHARGED INSURGENTS
WITH FIXED BAYONETS

MANILA. March 19.â recon

flying brigade, commanded by General
Wheaton, yesterday found Itself in an
awkward position and i was obliged to
charge the Filipinos with fixed bayo
nets. This dramatic incident changed
the situation.
One company of Washington volun
teers was stationed at Taguig. At 1
o'clock in the afternoon a regiment of
insurgents marched into the town in
columns of four. The company of
Washington volunteers opened fire on
them, and, at. the unexpected attack,
the insurgents scattered, 300 retreating
along the shore and 500 inland.
Three companies of the Twenty-sec
ond Infantry were sent out to recon
nolter the insurgent position. At 6
o'clock in the afternoon these com
panies ran into an insurgent ambush.
Their ammunition soon ran low. Some
of the men only had four rounds.
They were obliged to fix bayonets and
charge the insurgents, driving them
from ambush, and thus enabling our
troops to retreat successfully. Three
men were killed and twenty-one
wounded. Two of our men were taken
prisoners. One of them, on surrender-
In^ his rifle, was knocked on the head
by insurgents. He subsequently died.
The other shot one of his captors and
made his escape,
General Wheaton determined to send
out a punitive expedition. He ad
vanced the Twenty-second regulars on
! the right wing with two guns of the
Sixth Artillery. Five companies- of
Oregon Volunteers and six companies
of the Washington regiment formed
; the left wing. They started at 5

NEGOTIATIONS TO
TERMINATE THE WAR
NEW YORK, March 19.â Wash
ington correspondent of the Herald
telegraphs: Important negotiations will
be begun this week by the Philippines
Commission with leaders of natives on
the island of Luzon, looking to the res
toration of peace.
The State Department has been ad
vised of the arrival of Colonel Charles
Denby at Manila, so that the person
nel of the commission is now complete,
and it will immediately commence the
performance of its duties. An official
with whom I talked to-day told me the
administration expects more from the
commission in the way of securing the
establishment of peaceful conditions
than it expects from military opera
tions. The President recognizes that
If the natives are stubborn the war
can be kept up for the next five years,
âº and the cost to the island would be
great, both in blood and money. Now
that the natives have been given a se
vere lesson and have learned the dif
ference between Spanish and American
methods of warfare it is expected they
will be willing to listen to reason, and
the commission will explain to them
the purposes of the President and of
the intentions of this Government re
specting the government of the Philip
pine Islands.
Eventually the commission will visit
all the islands, with a view to comuni
cating to the natives the friendly in
tentions of the United States, but at
present it is propsed to confine its ef
forts to pacifying Luzon.
Military operations will be continued,
of course. In response to authority
given him by the War Department to
enlist Filipinos if he deems it wise tb
do so. General Otis has wired the
War Department that he will try the
experiment. The commission, of which
General Otis is a member, will deter

promise that a home rule government
will be set up over the entire archipel

Said to Favor Garrisoning Onr

Special IMspatch to The Call.
Call Headquarters. Wellington Hotel,
Washington, March 19.
A prominent United States Senator,
who assumes to have personal and di
rect knowledge, Is authority for the in
teresting statement that the President
has recently discussed a novel solution
of the question "How shall our colonies
be garrisoned?"
Although the indications for an early
adjustment of the insurrection in the
island of Luzon are favorable it is the
general impression among army offi
cers that these people, like all others
of fickle character, will be constantly
rebelling against our authority as from
time to time they find fault with our
exercise of government over them. It
is pointed out that the Cubans, the
Porto Ricans and the South American
natives are constantly rebelling against
the constituted authority; that this has
been -the case for centuries. The Fili
pinos, they say, are of the same char
acter. Moreover, while the natives of
Luzon may be subjugated there are
1400 other islands in that archipelago,
400 of which are well populated, but
with a class of people with whom it
will be hard to deal.
Our volunteers in the Philippines long
ago became tired of exile, and when
the treaty of peace lately ratified by
the United States and Spain has finally
been exchanged, which ceremony will
take place in a few days, the war will
have ceased practically and technically,
and the volunteers may then be mus
tered out upon theft own application.
It is needless to say that a vast ma
jority of them will apply for release,
and as it will have to be granted this
will leave only the 60,000 regulars.
It is assumed by the President and
i his advisers that there would be less
I objection among Democrats Â£o the re
| cruiting of the regular army up to the
j 100,000 standard, as proposed in the
j Hull reorganization bill, which meas
j ure was opposed especially by Demo
' crats from the South, if it were under
j stood that these soldiers would be re
! cruited from the negro population. It
! is assumed that the Southern Senators
j and Representatives would be willing
to increase th * regular army to the
i number of 35,000 additional men if it
were understood the regiments would
be recruited largely from the negro
ranks. It has been pointed out that the
negro regiments are not only very ef
ficient, but the negro, whose progeni
tors were accustomed to the rays of a
fierce African sun, will not be afraid
of spoiling their complexion in the Phil
ippines, Cuba or Porto Rico.
Whether or not the tentative sugges
tion will take the form of a recommen
dation to Congress at its next session,
the Senator was unable to say, but it
certainly j presents a most novel; solu
tion of the vexed problem of garrison
ing our new possessions.
SERIOUS CLASH
BETWEEN POLICE
AND THE PEOPLE
Many Wounded in an Affray
at Havana in Which
Cubans Participate.
PITCHED BATTLE AT A BALL
Insurgent Officers Head the Opposi
tion to Peace Officers and Use
Revolvers With Deadly
Effect.
Special Dispatch to The CaU.
HAVANA, March 19. â A serious
conflict between the police and
people of Havana occurred last
night, resulting In much shoot-
Ing and clubbing. From thirty
to fifty people were wounded, some se
riously. Among the Injured is Police
Captain Estampes, formerly a colonel
in the Cuban army.
Ever since the police interference
about a week ago at the demonstration
in honor of General Maximo Gomez
the police have been unpopular with
the populace, who jeer them and de
clare them inefficient. Certain news
papers let no opportunity escape to
criticize the force, denouncing the ar
rests as unfair and charging the po
lice' with "trampling upon the rights
of a free people." The police are vir
tually in the position of men who have
to make the people fear them in order
to secure ob^ience, as they have no
record to fall bar": upon for example.
Last night's trouble occurred at a
public mulatto ball in. San Jose street,
an unsavory quarter. Many Cuban of
ficers, colonels and captains among
them attended the affair. A policeman
on duty in that street, following orders
to prevent a crowd collecting in front
of the building where the ball was In
progress, asked a group of men to go
in or disperse. His request was un
heeded, and after repeating it he was
attacked by the group, whereupon
many men Issued from the building and
set upon him, took away his club and
revolver and handled him roughly. â¢
The policeman immediately notified
headquarters, which ordered twenty re
serves to the scene. The crowd had
prepared for their arrival. It Is said
they opened with a revolver fire upon
the police, which the latter returned,
the shooting being kept up until the
ammunition was exhausted.
The opponents of the police acted with
determination in the affray. Many who
were in the building mounted the roof,
which was low, and fired upon the po
lice from that point. They were appar
ently well armed, and this fact, together
with the resolution with which they
fought, seems to confirm the belief that
the attacking party was mostly made
up of Cuban officers, as ordinary civil
ians would have fled from the revolvers
of the police. ,
Many women were wounded. A re
port is in circulation this evening that
two of the injure^ civilians had suc
cumbed to their v%;inds, but this is
not confirmed. Among those seriously
hurt are Policemen Donato Aroza, En
rique Munoz and Benlgue Vasquez and
civilians Jose Dominguez, Etou Gall
ano, Alberto Aleja and Irene Rogue.
It is reported on good authority that
many were wounded who withdrew
hastily because unwilling to have it
known that they were present.
American troops were called to the
scene when the trouble was over and
numerous arrests followed. Police Cap
tain Estames, who is well known in
Cuban mlitary circles, is so badly in
jured that fears are entertained that he
will not recover.
Numerous permits have been issued
for similar balls this evening and it is
feared there may be further trouble.
Shortly before 9 o'clock it was re
ported that another conflict between
the people and the police had taken
place this evening in the outskirts of
Havana, and that two policemen and
several civilians were wounded. It is
asserted also that two policemen were
killed and that the reserves had been
called out.

MADRID, March 19.â Senor Sllvela,

fairs, had "a conference to-day with the

NEW YORK. March 19.â A special to

General Miles in the meat controversy
has been proved by the testimony adduced
by the court of inquiry and that the court
cannot fail to recommend the punishment
of those responsible. t yf
There is some talk that General Eagan,
who was in charge of the commissary de
partment during the war. would be
brought before another court-martial. The
fact that he had already been court-mar
tialed and is under sentence would not
prevent his being again called before a

The promise made to the voters of

The debt of gratitude which Califor

against corrupt influences and seduc

to the crack of the party lash wielded

tion of a United States Senator. Even
then there was found a change to be
made, and rather than rewrite it. it
was sent to both houses to-day with
the last correction marked through in
lead pencil lines that in not one whit
disguised its meaning. The erasure
read as follows:
"It is now apparent that no extra
session can be justified In order to
see whether you will, in the future,
perform a duty which has previously
been ignored."
It was the original intention of Gov
ernor Gage to hand in his message just
before the last balloting was begun
yesterday, but mature deliberation and
consultation with his confidants in both
houses convinced him that such action
would be ill-advised in view of the in
terpretation that many of those who
have been fighting for a Senator have
put upon his apparently close relations
with D. M. Burns and his adherents.
That his message would have been a
lever under the factional leanings of
every man in the House is evident upon
the reading of it. It was as follows:
EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT. STATE
OF CALIFORNIA, SACRAMENTO.
March 18, 1899. â To the Assembly of the
â¢State of California: A solemn duty re
quired of you as Assemblymen still re
mains unperformed. You have been elect
ed as agents of the people, not only to
pass necessary and judicious laws, but as
well to choose a United States Senator
to serve the State in Congress. As such
representatives you were elected not to
voice the desires of particular localities,
but to carry out the will of the great ma
jority of our people for their greatest pos
sible good. Your personal feelings, your
especial likes and dislikes, should, there
fore, be subordinated to the sense of pub
lic duty. The people demand a United
States Senator.
During the last political campaign no
subject was of higher importance than
the question of sustaining or opposing
the plan of territorial expansion and the
general national policy of our great Pres
ident. ' ,
That will of the majority of the people
of this State of all political predilections
as expressed at the polls, was in favor of
the national administration; and you
were, in effect, instructed by that splendid
majority to elect a Senator in accord
with the views of the President.
The demand of the people being thus
strongly manifested, no diversity of opin
ion, no private discords, should be per
mitted to prove an obstacle to the fulfill
ment of the popular desire.
In view of the great territorial expan
sion westward in the Pacific Ocean, the
commercial interests of this State are too
vast and its political position too impor
tant to be now impaired by your failure
to choose a national representative.
The power to select a Senator is vested
in you by the constitution, by the law and
by the people, and the people require at
your hands the exercise of that high pre
rogative.
And now, at the close of your session,
in the discharge of my solemn duty . as
your executive, I beseech you to disregard
and discard your individual prejudices
your personal disagreementsâ and to obey
the people's behest. I implore you, not as
partisans, but as distinguished representa
tives standing upon the high plane of
American citizenship, and as the agents
of the great majority of the people who
elected you, and also as the guardians of
the minority of our people, whom you
likewise represent, to execute at this time
the popular demand. I im\lore you to
falter no longer in the discharge of your
_.i<rh duty; to select for the State a proper
representative for the United States Sen
ate; to rise above the antagonisms which
have been engendered during your long
session, and to choose for the people a
man fully equipped, mentally and morally,
for the great office of United States Sen
ator; a man of distinguished abilities an
virtue, a man in whom the people will
perceive just grounds for confidence, a
man who will best subserve our commer
cial and political interests and represent
the dignity of our people.
HENRY C. GAGE.
Governor of the State of California.
Coming in as it did at the eleventh
hour it resulted in nothing of more
moment than round after round of
hearty applause in the Assembly and a
wrangle In the Senate. There was no
indication of a desire upon the part of
any of Mr. Burns' supporters to make
the capital they might of it. On the
contrary, Judge Dibble, in the Assem
bly, who yesterday gave his word of
honor that at 11 o'clock this morning
he would move to adjourn, so far
ignored it that he immediately rose to
move that the journal of yesterday be
approved. Mr. Valentine of Los An
geles was, however, more courteous
and moved that it be spread upon the
minutes of the last day, and it was so
ordered by Speaker Anderson..
As the true significance of the docu
ment dawned upon the Senate and the
crowd waiting in the lobby the bustle
attendant on the preparations for ad
journment ceased and the Senate be
came all attention. When the clerk
had finished reading a wild yell rose
from the Burns people and they cheered
and shouted until the Senators or those
whom Burns owned joined in the tur
moil. But even over the shouts of the
crowd Boyce's voice could be heard de
manding recognition and a chance to
speak. He was no friend to such a
course as the message . suggested and
the Burns crowd knew it, and as he
called the louder "the rooters yelled.
The President pro tern., nor his gavel,
nor the sergeants at arms, nor the
efforts of the more decent element could
â¢till the cry until It had run Its "course."
And when it died away Boyce was still
calling for the floor.
He was recognized and moved that
the communication be laid upon the
table. The motion was seconded at
once by Ashe. There were cries of
"No! no!" and when Dickinson moved
that the communication be received and
printed in the journal according to the
usual custom Boyce accepted the
amendment. But the Burns* men were
not willing to let this last chance go.
It was like the recent rain to the far
mer in their eyes, and even though
they had pledged themselves only the
night before to make no requests for
a postponement Wolfe rose to see what
he could do as a last effort.
"Mr. President," he said, "do you
suppose this is the only thing in order?
Is there no other course open to us but
to place this message on record and so
let it die? It will go all over the State
as one of the records of this Senate,
and the State will demand why it is we
have so coldly passed it by. I wish
we could do something more than
merely print in the journal these sen
timents which come so forcibly from
the Governor. They are the senti
ments of every good and true Repub
lican in California, and how will we
look our constituents in the face fair
ly after ignoring such a plea as this? Is
there nothing else we can do? Is there
no other way? Must we pass this by
with no further comment or action
than to order it printed in the
journal?"
It was as close as Wolfe could get to
the line without breaking the pledge
so solemnly, if unwillingly, given last
night. Had there been a word of en
couragement, even the faintest promise
of support, the pledge would have been
in the air and the battle would have
been on again to rage to the last flying
minutes of the session. But there was
no support for him and the only one
who spoke was Boyce.
"I believe the Republicans will justly
and fairly judge us for what we have
done," was all he said, and the silence
which followed seemed to indicate that
he voiced the sentiments of the Senate.
There was no roll call. The ayes were
put and brought a few responses. The
call for the noes met only silence, and
the Governor's message went off to the
printer and the journal.
DYING HOURS OF THE
SENATE A LOVE FEAST
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, March 19.â 1t was after half
past 1 instead of 11 when Lieutenant Gov
ernor Neff announced the adjournment of
the Senate and the fall of the gavel ended
legislation for two years to come. It was
two hours of mutual congratulation that
delayed matters, not any attempt of the
Senatorial corpse to rise from the grave
so deeply dug for it. There were presenta
tions to the Lieutenant Governor, the
President pro tern., the Secretary and the
sergeant at arms, and there were words
of esteem passed from majority to minor
ity and back again, from Democrat to Re
publican, from floor to desk. But all this
time the clock stopped, to listen, and if it
Is to be believed the old Senate timepiece
declares even now it is five minutes to 11.
Business was practically a secondary
matter, but still the Senate managed to
earn the salary it will not get. The ap
pointment of F. S. Chadbourne to the
Harbor Commission, announced last night
by the Governor, was taken up and on
motion of Dickinson was confirmed. In
the rollcall the Democrats all asked to be
excused from voting, a courtesy which
was granted them. Chadbourne has been
appointed to succeed Rudolph Herold,
whom the Governor said had not complied
with all the forms necessary and conse
quently had not properly qualified for the
office. The Democrats had no desire to
antagonize Governor Gage, nor did they
wish to legislate Herold out of office, a
combination of circumstances which
brought them permission to remain silent.
At 10:45 Dickinson called attention to
t l '^ fact that the Senate was still working
or': he session of Saturday, the 18th, and
he moved that the House adjourn to con
vene agflln immediately in session for the
10th. The logic of this lay in the fact
that last night's session adjourned at ..30
this morning, and the adjournment then
was really a recess until 9 o'ciock. There
'- some c'atisc or section or article or
something in the constitution Which
makes that kind of a procedure advisable,
if not rccessary.
Immediately affe-* this phantom ad
journment the roll was called again and
the Senate it ported for duty. 'On motion
of Dickinson, Senators Dickinson, Doty
and Gillette were appointed a committee
to notify the Governor that the Senate
was ready to adjourn sine die. Senators
Morehouse, Sims anti Davis were appoint
ed a committee to present the same in
formation to the Assembly.
On motion of Smith, a committee of
three was appointed to examine into the
subject of county taxation and revenue,
its report to be presented to the next ses
sion of the Legislature. The committee
is composed of Senator Smith of Fresno,
Senator Taylor of Alameda and Senator
Sims of Santa Rosa.
It was then the Governor's message was
presented and read, and when Wolfe's
plea was over and a few resolutions pro
viding contingent expenses had been
passed the Senate adjourned sine die.
It was then the presentations were
made, the Senate coming to order as if
it had not adjourned. To Lieutenant Gov
ernor Neff Senator Boyce, on behalf of
the Senate, presented a magnificent game
service and also a dressing case. Then
Taylor called Flint to the bar of the
house and presented him with a silver
water ewer. Then Morehouse called Frank
J. Brandon, the secretary of the --Senate,
and after paying him some well-merited
compliments he presented him with a sil
ver service, and Shortridge presented a
similar one to Lou Martin, the sergeant
at arms. Then Sims spoke for the minor
ity, and Smith for the majority, and Da
vis called for Shortridge, and on behalf
erf the lady attaches of tnÂ«- Senate pre
sented him wi-i* a tie redder and if pos
sible more boisterous than any he had
worn during the session. In reply Short
ridge in a half serious, half apologetic
way spoke of himself, of his mannerism
on the floor of the Senate and of his re
lations to his fellow Senators. â¢ In doing
so he* delivered one of the prettiest
speeches heard during. this Legislature.
Then the crowd broke up and the ser
geant at arms took possession of the fast
emptying chamber. -â ;--,â

SEARCH FOR THE
WINDSOR VICTIMS
Two Hundred Men Work
in the Ruins.
NO BODIES YET RECOVERED

DOWN CHIMNEYS. . .
Several Guests Reported Missing, In

counted For. .
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, March 19.â 1n a driz
ling rain more than 200 men continued
to-day to work among the debris.* and
smoldering ruins of the Windsor Hotel,
searching for the bodies of those who
perished in the flames and to recover
any valuables that might have escaped
the ravages of the fire. .The efforts of
the searchers were futile, however, as
the ruins were too hot to permit much
progress and the smoke arising from
the burning material was rendered
more dense by the dampness of the at
mosphere. At Intervals during the
night flames burst forth from the burn
ing embers and forced back the work
men.
Work was begun this morning to de
molish the fragmentary portions of
walls en the east and north sides of
the burned building, and later the num
ber of workers was reinforced and the
work of removing the rubbish pushed
as vigorously as was practicable.
The chimney, eighty-five feet high,
standing on the Forty-sixth-street side
of i the ruins, near Fifth avenue, was
blown up to-day. Thirty pounds of
dynamite were placed under the base
of this chimney and electricity was
used to explode it
Smoke and steam still rise from the
debris and now and then tongues of
flame shoot up, even at this late hour
after the fire. The workmen have been
able* to do only a little superficial work.
When they dig down a little way the
debris is so hot that they are obliged
to move to another location.
During the day workmen were en
gaged in picking to pieces the six-story
wall that is standing on the Forty
seventh-street side of the hotel site, in
order to make the search in the ruins
safe.
The second eighty-five-foot chimney
was dynamited shortly after 3 o'clock
this afternoon. The explosion wrecked
a number of plate-glass windows and
doors in near-by residences.
A large force of men were at work
during the afternoon on what was the
main entrance to the hotel. It was ex
pected that bodies would first be found
there. A large amount of small arti
cles, principally the personal property
of guests, was found.
Daniel Sweeney, the emergency
wrecker of the building department,
and three men had a narrow escape
from injury and. possibly death about
5 o'clock. The four men were on top of
the six-story wall, which was still
standing on . the Forty-seventh street
rear corner of .the hotel, tearing it
down. A stiff north wind blew up sud
denly, and Sweeney felt the wall
trembling beneath him. Sweeney
cried out a warning and the men hur
ried from their dangerous perch. They
were just outside the danger line when
a great section of the wall, thirty or
more feet square and including that
portion on which they had been work
ing, went down with a roar. . A portion
of it fell on the roof of the house back
of the hotel, wrecking the roof. The
house had been emptied by order of
the building deparment and nobody
was injured.
Following is a list of the missing, cor
rected to up to 8 o'clock to-night:

DID THIEVES FIRE
THE WINDSOR HOTEL?
NEW 'YORK, March 19.â A mass of
testimony is accumulating tending to
show that the Windsor Hotel fire hor
ror was of incendiary origin; that the
motive was robbery, and that in some
cases at least the thieves were success
ful. From all sides come corroborative
evidence of the presence of â  thieves in
the building at the very beginning of
the fire. They sprang up on the differ
ent floors with the flames, and even
cloaked their purpose under pretense of
assisting those in distress.
Startling as any that has come from
a survivor of the fire is the story told
by Mrs. E. W. Sherwood, a writer.
Mrs. Sherwood was In the apartments
of Mrs. Abner McKinley, who had in
vited her to share a view of the St.
Patrick's day parade from the windows
of her rooms. Mrs. Sherwood's apart
ments were on the sixth floor on the
Forty-sixth-street side of the hotel and
did not command a good view of Fifth
avenue. Mrs. Sherwood gladly accepted
Mrs.; McKinley's offer and was seated
at one of the windows when the alarm
of fire was given.
Mrs. Sherwood dashed from the Mc-
Kinley apartments and sought escape
through the hallway. It was then
comparatively free from smoke and she
could see without difficulty. In the ex
citement of the moment she stood near
the door of the rooms she had just
ft, thinking which was the nearest
and safest exit. Mrs. Sherwood is
wealthy and has, or had, many jewels.
Diamond rings were on the fingers of
both her hands. A man ran up to her,
and making a pretense of assisting her
seized one hand in both of his and be
gan trying to slip the rings from her
fingers. When she realized his real mo
tive she screamed, and being strong
and agile for a person of her years be
gan to beat the thief off. The thief
fought with her for possession of the
rings. No one for an instant paid any
attention to either of them in the ex
citement. A fireman finally dashing
through the hall went to Mrs. Sher
wood's assistance and the thief beat a
retreat.
Mrs. Sherwood says she is positive
the hotel was set on fire in several
places at once by thieves for the pur
pose of plundering.
ROBBERS AT WORK
DURING THE FIRE
NEW YORK, March 19.â A. P. Dem
orest called at the East Twelfth street
police station and reported that he had
a small safe filled with jewels valued at
$10,000 in the ruins of the fire. His
wife and daughter and son occupied
rooms on the third floor, near Fifth
avenue and Forty-seventh street. They
were all in their rooms when the fire
occurred. His daughter, when the fire
was. discovered, went to the small safe
containing the jewels and tried td open
it, but forgot the combination in her
excitement. Mr. Demorest stated that
when he opened the' door to his room
he saw three men running about in the
smoke and going into rooms. The ,
were not flrei-.en and he was certain
they were not employes. He thinks
they were robbers. He and his family
then went out on the fire escape and
were rescued by firemen. Mr. Demor
est was apprehensive about the safety
of the safe and' its valuables.
Thomas Cleary 'of 911 Third avenue
called on Inspector Harley and stated
that he assisted a woman from the ho
tel whom he afterward ascertained
was Mrs.. Abner McKinley. He took
her to the street and put her in a cab.
Mrs. McKinley told him that she had
dropped a bag containing some jewelry.
He ran back and got the bag and gave
it to Mrs. McKinley and she drove off.
Inspector Harley held Cleary in order
to verify the story. Of three trunks
taken from the debris at Forty-seventh
street and Fifth avenue Saturday
afternoon, two were claimed by Abner
McKinley. â

Heavy Precipitation in
Many Sections.
THE SAN JOAQUIN BLESSED
DOWNPOUR IN PORTIONS OF THE
VALLEY.
Indications Announced by the
Weather Bureau for To-Day Are
That the Showers Will
Continue.-
San Francisco got another drenching
yesterday. For a few hours the clouds
opened and not only this city, but the
entire State from Oregon to the Mexi
can â¢ line, got a share of . the
golden drops. __ The rainfall here for
twenty- four hours, as reported by the
local forecast official, amounted to .38
of an inch. At San Luis Obispo the
heaviest fall occurred. At Los Angeles
rain fell last night, while at Fresno
there was but a trace of rain. Portions
of the San Joaquin Valley were in the
path of the storm, and at Bakersfleld
there was a heavy fall of rain.
The storm moved rapidly northeast
ward and Is now central in the British
Possessions north of Washington.
Rain is "billed" generally for the
coast to-day, with light, variable winds.
The winds on the coast incline ..west
erly, but the pressure continues to fall,
thus indicating that it will be safe to
carry an umbrella for the greater por
tion of to-day, at least.
OUTLOOK FOR GOOD
CROPS NEVER BETTER
Heavy Precipitation Gives Impetus
to the Already Thriving
Grain.
MONTEREY, March Again this
section of Monterey County is being
blessed with a splendid rain. At 4 o'clock
this morning rain began falling, heavily,
continuing until 7:30. There were inter
mittent showers during the remainder of
the forenoon and up to 2 p. m., when a
downpour set in. Nearly an Inch has
already fallen, and heavy clouds, a warm
southeast wind and a low barometer
promise more rain during the night. The
storih of' the' early part of the week
meant Incalculable benefit to this section.
Breaking the drought in the nick of time,
it dispelled the prospects of utter ruin
that confronted many ranch men and
fruit-gowers. This second rain not only
saves the crops, but assures good ones.
In Carmel Valley, the principal fruit sec
tion of this region, the precipitation for
the two storms was 3.78 inches.
BAKERSFIELD, March 19.â 1t rained
heavily here this afternoon. All indlca
cations point to an extended storm. This
insures good crops in all but the northern
part of the county, where the grain was
sold to sheep men for food several weeks
ago. Kern County's output will be up to
the average this year.
MODESTO, March 19.â The storm this
afternoon preciplti ted .28 of an inch of
rain. The total for the storm is 1.53
Inches. The weather Is threatening.
SACRAMENTO, March 19.â There was
a sharp shower of rain here between 5
and 6 o'clock this evening and the indi
cations are that more is coming. Re
ports from outside the city are that all
kinds of crops are doing well. There has
been no killing frost in this vicinity and
the outlook is bright for a heavy fruit
harvest.
STOCKTON, March 19.â Rain has been
falling intermittently all day, and this
evening it is pouring down. Over a half
inch had fallen up to 7:30 o'clock. Re
ports indicate that the rain is general
over the county. '.'...*
AUBURN, March 19.â 1t began raining
again this afternoon. THe indications are
favorable for another good storm, which
cannot prove otherwise than beneficial.
LOS ANGELES. March 19.â Light show
ers of rain fell at Los Angeles and San
Diego during the night, followed this
morning by bright, sunshiny weather.
The precipitation in this city for the
storm amounted to 1.08 inches, making
3.93 for the season. Snow fell heavily in
the higher mountain ranges, assuring a
good irrigation supply for the coming
season. Crops in Southern California are
now taking on a prosperous appearance,
and while the yieid will be less than
hoped for the vast improvement in the
situation during the past week has caused
a great jubilation. To-night a heavy rain
storm set in. It probably will continue all
night.
SAN JOSE, March 19.â A warm rain
which the moist ground readily absorbed
commenced to fall at noon to-day. At 4
o'clock it was resolved into the heaviest
downpour of the season, with no present
prospects of cessation. Up to 9 o'clock
SO of an inch had fallen, making a total
of 11 19 for the season, against 5.48 for
the corresponding period last year. The
great benefit of this last rain will be seen,
so all orchardlsts and farmers, predict,
in the largest grain and fruit yield known
in the history of recent years. The frosts
which followed the rain of last week
were slight and did no damage. Irriga
tion everywhere has stopped, and in
many sections will not be resorted to for
two months at least.
SAN DIEGO. March 19.â The present
prospects appear good for more rain. The
barometer is falling to-night, but it has
not yet reached the storm point. The sky

LOST-THE BODY OF
MAXIMILIAN DAMM
Disappearance of the Remains
of tbe Multi-Milliooaire While
Ep Route to Mexico.
AUSTIN, Tex., March 19.â dispatch has been received here from
Tampico, Mex., stating that the steamer Scotia, of the Hamburg-Ameri
can line, arrived there on Monday, March 10, having on board the re
mains of Maximilian Damm, the multi-millionaire mining man of Du
rango, Mex., who died recently while on a visit to Germany. â  He also
held the position of German Consul at Durango at the time of his
death. The remains were being returned to Mexico to be interred, and
a large number of distinguished Mexicans were at Tampico to meet the
body. On leaving the port of Hamburg the ccsket containing the body
was placed in the head of the vessel and marked "M. D.," without any
other marks of identification, as Is customary in making shipments by
vessel. Through the carelessness of some one of the crew the case con
taining the body has been lost, and it is supposed that it was unloaded at
some port at which the vessel stopped between Tampico and Hamburg.
The vessel was delayed at Tampico sev*. 1 days while a thorough
search was made for the case, but no trace of it could be found. A spe
cial train was on hand to convey the body to Durango. *

that as a matter of fact he is imprisoned
The reason for the deposition of the Em

the fact that he had adopted Christianity'

a flower boy, who, he said, had admission
to the Emperor s palace, and on one of his

Dr. Palmer, when seen at the conclu

Special Dlspat eh to The Call.
ST. LOUIS. March 19.â The army beef scandal has reached St.
Louis in the shape of a quiet investigation for the purpose of obtain
ing what available evidence exists for use before the War Board of
Inquiry.
Last week Colonel Garlington, one of the inspector generals, was in
the city to see a number of prospective witnesses, with the view of
ascertaining if their testimony would be material. It is unofficially
announced that the result was more than startling.
Inspector General Garlington paid the city a hasty visit and pro
ceeded to Omaha, where fie Is said to be engaged in obtaining evi
dence germane to the points at issue.
Friends of General Nelson A. Miles have taken up the work in St.
Louis started by Colonel Garlington. Some fifteen or twenty wit
nesses have been sounded and if rumors are true their testimony will
prove highly interesting. Most of these men are ex-soldiers, who can
testify from personal experience as to the quality of the beef served
to their respective regiments and companies.
LEAVENWORTH. Kans., March 19.â
The army beef court of inquiry con
cluded the taking of testimony at Fort
Leavenworth at noon to-day and at
4:15 o'clock departed for Chicago, where
the sessions will be resumed Monday
morning. The sole witness examined to
day was Sergeant Edward Mason,
Troop A, First United States Cavalry,
located at Fort Robinson, Neb., who
served as regimental commissary ser
geant at Lakeland, Fla., and during the
>an camp;:
Sergeant Mason's testimony was
" probably the most direct that has been
â¢adduced since the court left Chcago,
witness declaring that meat received at
Lakeland for use in his regiment was
"undoubtedly chemically treated." An
. agent of Armour & Co.. he further testi
fied, "told me at the time that this meat
had' been treated with what was called
" preservaline." Witness had refused to
accept the meat. Sergeant Mason was
interrogated individually by each mem
ber of the court and could not be shaken
in his testimony.
â  * The court met at 10 o'clock this morning
in the court-martial room at the fort.
Sergeant Mason, whose failure to reach
. the court yesterday m.-de it necessary for
the court "to take Sunday testimony, was
first on the stand and questioned by Re
corder Davis. He told of the meat fur
. nished on the voyage from Tampa to
Cuba. No complaints were made ot the
â tanned roast beer, but. the meat was
la^ess and unsatisfactory generally
* and had to oe thrown overboard in Cuba
Th? men of his regiment would not eat
ihe canned roast beef, and .as a rule it
â¢was thrown away. The refrigerated beet
Â£ssed after the surrender was good, out

The witness was then taken in hand by
Maior Lee. He said he was detailed com

"The meat was supplied in the morn
ing, and it smelled bad and had a bad

speaking of it. said: 'That is preserva

tect the meatâ to preserve it.' As to what
preservaline was, I do not know."
"Was this agent at Lakeland or at j
Tampa?"
"He came from Tampa."
"Do you wish the court to understand
that very much of the meat supplied to
you of that refrigerated beef had been '
treated chemically?"
"I would not swear that It was. I
will say that. In my opinion. it was."

appearance."
"How about the beef you received later j
in Cuba?"
"The majority of the meat we received !
In Cuba spoiled on us. It was the fault
of the climate, as I thought at the time."
"Did It have this white appearance."
"I could not say, because it was all in
cloths." .1 - y
"Who was present besides yourself at
this interview with the agent of Armour,

"Lieutenant Hartman and probably Ser
geant Abies, who is now a commissary
sergeant at Santiago."

mour man?" <â _*?
"Yes, sir. I am positive of that because
I made out the vouchers." ; y . y.
"Was he a resident of Tampa, or did he
simply come from there?"

man?"
"What was his appearance?
"He was a short, heavy set man. In
fact. Armour had two agents thereâ one
a young man of 23, the other decidedly
Jewish In appearance. The one 1 refer to
was the young man."

surface of the meatâ the preservaline?"

it off. It would break. It was so tight
I could not scrape it off."
SNOW EXTERMINATING
DEER AND ANTELOPE
Herds in Yellowstone National it-ark
Are Starving to
Death.
WASHINGTON. ?*-Â»rch 19.â Captain
Erwin, acting superintendent of the Yel
lowstone National Park, has reported to
the Interior Department that the unprec
edented fall of snow In the par* thfe year
unquestionably will lead to the death of
many antelope, deer and elk before the
winter is over. In places in the park
snow Is over twelve feet deep and is hrm
lv crusted everywhere, which prevents
these animals digging through and obtain
ing their food underneath. This condition.
it is expected, probably will last all this
month and perhaps next. A small ap
propriation from the park revenue for
buying hay is asked. Many deer are now
in "the immediate neighborhood of the
military post picking up bits of hay. The
scouts report the elk very weak and be
lieve that unless steps are taken to feed
them the deaths among them will amount
to thousands. The main herd of buffalo,
however, being ln a region of hot springs
that melt the snow, are getting along
fairly well.

the corpses of the victims were carried
half a mile, and nine of them were

Special Dispatch to The Call.
PORTLAND, Or., March 19.â The ar
rest of Elmo Call on the charge that
he attempted to rob the grave of Mrs.
Grace Ethel Trevor, wife of W. H. G.
Trevor of Seattle, has created great ex
citement here. Mrs. Trevor died while
undergoing an operation for cancer in a
Seattle hospital, and it was feared
physicians of that city who maintained
that the woman was not afflicted with
the malady for which she was treated
would endeavor to steal the body to
prove their claims. In order to prevent
this, two men were employed to watch
the grave at St. Mary's Catholic Ceme
tery, East Side, for three days. On the
Very first night that vigilance was re
laxed the sexton discovered that an at
tempt had been made to exhume the
body. Call, who was found near the
grave at the time, was placed under
arrest. '.?<? : ?
It was early this evening when the
sexton's attention was attracted by the
disordered condition of the Trevor
grave while on a tour of inspection.
Approaching more closely, he saw that
the flowers with which It was covered
at the time of the interment were re
moved, and that nearly two feet of
earth had been thrown out. In the
soft mud at the bottom of the excava
tion were found footprints, but, on at
tempting to follow them, they were lost
in the grass near by. A spade lay
near, where it evidently had been
dropped by the grave robber in making
his escape. â Â«..__- ,
The sexton found young Call loitering
near the gate. On bein- questioned,
the boy admitted that he had been dig
ging in the cemetery, saying that other
boys had told him to do so. The sex
ton spent no time looking for the
"other boys," but immediately went to
his house near by with the youth in his
custody and telephoned for the police.
Chief of Police McLauchlan is of the
opinion that Call, who seems to be
mentally unbalanced, had been prompt
ed to dig in the grave by some one who
was after the body, and a search for
the real culprit, whoever he may be,
has been instituted. A watch has been
placed on the grave and will be kept
up until the body may be placed in a
burglar-proof vault. â  *_
The police authorities in Seattle have
been notified and will make an investi
gation there to learn, if possible, who
the phvslcians were who were so anxi
ous to' prove that Mrs. Trevor's death
was the result of unprofessional ex
perimenting. - '

While Removing Patients to

Special Dispatch to The Call.
LAREDO, Tex., March 19.â The work
of removing the smallpox patients to
the pesthouse under direction of State
Health Officer Blunt was begun this
morning. After ten had been removed
the officers encountered a mob of Mexi
cans on East Matamoras street, who
menaced them in such a manner that
the Chief of Police was telephoned for.
Marshal Joseph Barthelow and Assist
ant Marshal Nye Idar hurried to the
scene, and when they attempted to ar
rest the leaders of the disturbance they
were assaulted with stones and fired on.
Idar was knocked down and severely
beaten about the head before he could
be rescued. One of the rioters was
shot, but, aided by his friends, man
aged to escape. About twenty shots
were fired, a dozen arrests made and
the mob dispersed.
The health officers resumed their
work, but were soon met by another
mob of 500 or 600 Mexicans, many of
them armed. As they could not con
tend with this force the health officers
desisted and Dr. Blunt opened tele
graphic communication with Governor
Sayers. As a result he was instructed
to call on the United States military au
thorities at Fort Mcintosh in the name
of the Governor for such assistance as
was necessary, and later he was in
formed that the War Department had
telegraphed authority to use troops.
The Mexicans are much excited and
express contempt for the negro United

COPPER MINING ON
ALASKA'S COAST
Extensive Ledges Being Developed
Between Orcas and
Valdez.
TACOMA, March 19.â The country about
the mouth of Copper River, Alaska, is
likely to become famous for copper mines.
Great ledges of copper have been found
on tidewater between Orca and Valdez.
The most important ledge was discovered
last summer by Noah O'Connell and since
sold to a Tacoma syndicate, which is
shipping ore to the Tacoma smelter.
This ledge, the Copper Queen, was un
covered by glacial action for 3000 feet
from tidewater, and runs thence into a
bluff which rises 1000 feet. The ledge is
four feet wide, extending upward twelve
feet above tidewater. An almost inex
haustible amount can thus be mined with
out driving shafts or tunnels. The ore
runs $60 to the ton, containing 28 per cent
copper and $20 in gold.
Other ledges have been located and are
being developed by men who claim they
are working for a syndicate of Standard
OH stockholders. An English syndicate
is represented by Mining Expert Llewel
lyn Williams of London. ;*â¢

Mary A. Clark, aged 52. was beaten to
death and her sister, Annie Clark, aged

Md., a village near this place, by John
Berry, a 15-year-old negro boy. The deed
was an atrocious one, the aged and de
fenseless women being surprised by the
boy and literally beaten to a jelly with a
club. Miss Annie Clark saved herself
from instant death by promising to give
the boy $100 and pledging herself not to
betray him if he spared her life. Berry
was arrested and confessed his guilt. For
fear that he would be lynched he was
taken to Baltimore to-night for safe
keeping.

LTRADE here AND elsewhere.
BUSINESS throughout the country at large is
keeping the pace set a year ago with the regu
larity of a walking beam. There is no halt any
where. The movement of goods is the greatest ever
known, and from present indications bids fair to con
tinue so. With the exception of iron and steel, no
industry or branch of trade is conspicuously active,
but the whole situation is one of remarkable life. The
export to foreign countries shows no general abate
ment. True, the exports of breadstuffs, provisions,
cotton and oil fell off $6,000,000 in February, but those
of manufactured goods . were $5,200,000 larger than
during the same month last year, and were sufficient
to cover 60 per cent of the imports. The iron trade
continues to lead all others. Nine-tenths of the mills
are now engaged, and will be until August, on orders
taken months ago, before the current rise in prices
took place. Late buyers have to pay fancy quotations
to get their orders accepted at all. Against this rosy
picture, however, is the already noted loss of consid
erable foreign business on account of the sharp ad
vance in prices and the withdrawal of not a few orders
for the future. It is therefore possible that the iron
industry is too prosperous for its permanent good.
Time will tell. . ;
The failures last week were 189, against 208 for the
same week last year. The bank clearings showed a
gain of 42.9 per cent, and Kansas City and New Or
leans were the only two cities of any size exhibiting
a decrease. The heaviest gains were 55 per cent in
New York and 113.5 per cent in Baltimore. The ap
proach of spring has quickened the demand for dry
goods, millinery, clothing and footwear, and these
lines are reported very active. But per contra, wool
and cotton are dull and the latter has declined in spite
of bad' crop reports. The exports of flour and wheat
are slightly in excess of 1898. The lumber trade con
tinues active, with a marked scarcity in hards woods.
.The feeling in Wall street was bearish, especially
during the early part of the week, the fear of higher
money having led to more or less selling, under the
influence of which prices declined somewhat. Other
wise the market was without feature.
Of course the rain was the feature of the local situ
ation last week. It brightened things tip wonderfully.
It. came in the nick of time. Most sections of the
State could have held out a few days longer, and the
northern coast counties probably could have matured
a fair crop as it was, but the major portion of the
State needed rain at once. The situation had got to
that point where capital sirftply withdrew from the
market until the State got into better shape. But as
soon as it was fully known that the State had received
a good wetting down there was an immediate loosen
ing of money, which has already become apparent.
The situation has cleared to this extent that even
without any more rain we shall have a fair crop, pro
vided the north winds hold off; for a fierce north wind
can dry up the ground and wither a healthy crop in
two days, besides playing havoc with fruit. There is
no reason, however, to suppose that we will not get
the usual spring showers, in which case the harvest of
the State will be large.
It was generally expected that a marked decline in
the price of many products would follow a rain, but
such has not proved the case. Wheat and barley
futures went down rapidly, and spot wheat also fell
off, but spot barley declined a mere fraction, almost
immediately recovering. Small supplies kept hay,
beans, potatoes, fruits, etc.. firm in the face of the rain,
for the truth is we were getting pretty short of these
products and will be well cleaned up by the time the
new crops come in.
The coming week may see more or less fluctuation
in quotations of produce. There will be a readjust
ment to the new conditions. Some lines will probably
go down and others up. Beef is already steadier, as
the starting up of the green feed will enable stockmen
to hold on to their cattle, which means diminished
shipments to this market now, but larger shipments
later on in the season. It generally takes some days,
however, for the readjustment to become marked.
At any rate, the prospects of the State to-day are im
measurably better than they were this day last week
and much better than at this time last year.

THE REPUBLICAN VICTORY.
THE closing scenes in the Legislature were re
volting to every citizen who respects his State
and loves his country. The feeling of disgust,
however, is limited to the legislators who co-operated
with the railroad iv its efforts, helped by the Exam
iner, to elect Dan Burns and to destroy the prestige
of the Republican party in this State, so as to insure
Democratic success in 1900. These men exhibited the
audacity and the recklessness of detected criminals of
the violent type. One of the Senators, in the extrem
ity of his passion because the majority of his Repub
lican associates respected themselves and their party,
literally screamed that his candidate was "the Re
publican of Republicans,", and compared his defeat
to the assassination of Caesar. The intellectual differ
ence between Burns and Caesar is about as wide as
the chasm of ages between 'the two incidents which
were thus ridiculously compared, but there was one
point of analogy, namely, that Brutus killed Caesar
for inflicting the last destructive blow on republican
Rome. Another Senator, who had not received the
disgraceful notoriety to which he considered himself
entitled, bawled out, "I am for the Southern Pacific,
and I don't care who knows it."
In the exuberance of their disappointment a num
ber of the supporters of Burns almost tumbled over
each other and frothed at the mouth as they dictated
their own political . epitaphs. Senator Davis, how
ever, whose poise and whose courage in standing up
for political integrity were superb, on behalf of him
self and his fellows, who defeated Dan Burns, the
railroad and the Examiner, expressed the actual con
clusion of the whole matter in these telling words:
"We will go home to our people with the clear con
science of men who have done our duty. We will go
back and tell them that the candidacy of Daniel M.
Bums was not acceptable to the honest men of the
Republican party, and if you think, gentlemen, that
we have hurt the grand old organization by rejecting
such as he, then I tell you you are mistaken, and we
have saved the party from disgrace."
The Examiner of yesterday conspicuously displayed
its intimate relations with the discomfited conspira
tors. It published an exclusive communication from
Dan Burns, in which that extinguished politician in
effect assigned his own rejection as the reason for the
failure to elect a Federal Senator. In a capitalized
editorial, consisting mainly of congenial epithets,
that truculent journal speaks of the "disgrace" of the
Legislature "as the opportunity of the Democracy."
But, fortunately for the Republican party, while thirty
members committed political suicide the Legislature
was not disgraced, and the opportunity coveted by
the railroad and the Examiner has lapsed. The Call
has a little natural pride in having taken a conspicuous
part in redeeming the pledges and in vindicating the
integrity of the Republican party and in upholding
the honor of the State. The railroad was beaten and
its falsehood rebuked. The Examiner was beaten and
branded as a traitor to every sound principle it has
avowed. Dan Burns was killed and his political
corpse prepared for interment. It is true that the life
of the Legislature was prolonged until after the
church organs began their solemn appeals on the
first day of the week, and that until the gavels fell the
mirror of hope was still dimmed by the breath of
corruption. But the obsequies of the joint convention
were final, and when, after their completion, the mid
night bells of Saturday tolled they inaugurated a new
day, in which' the citizens of this great State were
enabled to welcome the rising sun with the enthusi
asm of the Aztecs. When, as the adjournment was
announced, the last vestige of uncleanness vanished
from the legislative halls the gathered congregations
of California may well have thanked God for relief
and the Lenten season has been enlivened by a senti
ment of exultation.
THE BOUNTIFUL R^INS.
BY reason of the profuse rains, followed by mild
weather, California isÂ» virtually assured of a
year of prosperity, and her people already feel
the effects of the assurance. There will now be a
greater energy and activity, because of a greater
hopefulness in work, and all lines of industry will be
gin to improve.
During the season of uninterrupted sunshine, when
it seemed that another dry year was before us, and
that our crops would be small, some of our Puget
Sound contemporaries condoled with us in words of
sympathy. At the same time, however, they argued
that their own communities would lose nothing by
our calamity, and therefore while they felt a true sor
sow in our loss, they showed no signs of weeping
enough to furnish us with irrigation. ,
One of their most frequent comments on the situa
tion was that as California would have no wheat and
very little fruit to export, the demand of the Pacific
Oce&n countries for such articles would have to go to
Washington to obtain supplies, and as a consequence
the commerce of the Pacific would center at Puget
Sound ports, and San Francisco, despite her wealth,
her population and her energy, would become sub
ordinate as a trading center and be known on the
coast chiefly as a pleasure resort.
Doubtless there was some foundation for the argu
ment. The interests of every commercial city are
largely dependent upon the prosperity of the country
back of it. San Francisco would have lost much by
a drought in* the interior, and has therefore as valid
reason as any farming district to rejoice in the boun
tiful rains that have fallen to save the State from the
threatened disaster of short crops and our good
friends of Puget Sound from the wear and tear upon
their sympathies. .'_,,_.
Once more California has shown the world that she
has not only a good climate throughout the year,. but
also the sort of weather that is needed to render such
a climate suitable to industry as well as to pleasure.
We have had a winter of elysian brightness, and now
we have had the rains needed to nourish all forms of
life. We shall have wheat enough to supply a .large
part of the Oriental demand and fruit enough to sup
ply epicures in Washington with something delicious
and luscious when they tire of their â¢ own water
logged and mildewed stuff.
The whole aspect of affairs has been changed during
the week past and almost every prospect brightened.
The rains have turned the crisis in our favor and
saved the situation. Moreover, there remain two
months of showers before the clouds pass away from
the sky and dry summer days are at hand. Within
those months we may now reasonably expect pro
pitious weather. The outlook is bright for us,
and to all our sympathizing neighbors we return
their kind condolences with thanks, having no further
use for them. -.
ORIGINAL YELLOW LITERATURE.
THE Examiner-Journal or, Journal-Examiner, as
the Asiatic twins that desire to inundate the
United States with cheap labor are called, has
made some original discoveries. It found out that
the Federal constitution had been "outgrown" before
the expression was used. It also ascertained that we
were not to be "tied to the apron strings" of the
framers and the expounders of that instrument, the
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, MARCH 20, 1899.
prevailing error as to the sex of whom was thus for
the first time disclosed. It afterward' underscored its
originality by calling Senator Hoar and; other
acknowledged statesmen and jurists who agreed with
him "old women."
At various times it has published for the benefit of
the rising generation elementary treatises on the best
modes of perpetrating crimes such as murder, forgery,
embezzlement and burglary. It has also furnished
much educational matter illustrating the N rise and
progress of pruriency. Yesterday it supplied a strik
ing novelty by turning a woman, convicted of having
poisoned her lover's wife, into a Judge. Mrs. Minnie
Adams, having been placed on her preliminary ex
amination for murder, the Examiner obtained from
Mrs. Botkin an "authorized statement" to the effect
that she believes Mrs. Adams "innocent," but con
siders that "police methods are against her." In
cidentally the sentenced woman who , has survived
the ordeal the other woman is about to undergo re
fers to her own conviction as "a judicial farce" and
informs an expectant community that if she had only
known as much as she does now she could have pur
chased her freedom. â¦
Expansion evidently takes on many phases, but we
would be glad to learn whether this latest development
is to be classified under the head of '"national policy"
or of "internal policy." Some old fogies among our
citizens might change a letter, in the last quotation and
call it "infernal policy."
THE RUMORS OBOUT REED.
WITH a persistency bom, perhaps, of a sheer
lack of ability to invent something new, our
Democratic contemporaries are circulating ru
mors of Speaker Reed's hostility to the : President
and of the President's determination to bring about
the election of. a supporter of the administration to
the Speakership of the next Congress.
The known opposition of the Speaker to some of
the masures advocated during the recent session of
Congress affords the only foundation for the rumors.
There is no evidence that the Speaker used the powers
of his office to defeat any bill which the administration
thought important to the welfare of the country, nor
is there any evidence that the administration backed
any of the bills which were defeated in committee or
in the House whether by reason of the Speaker's
antagonism or not.
The war with Spain imposed upon the late Congress
a vast amount of work outside the ordinary routine
of legislation. The performance of that work was
imperative, and as a consequence the consideration of
the less pressing measures of peace had to be post
poned. As a result there has been a good deal of
disappointment, and the disappointed people have
assumed that their bills and hopes were defeated be
cause of the opposition of the Speaker.
Out of the situation there has come a desire on the
I part of some of the discontented members of Con
! gress to elect in the next Congress a Speaker whom
i they believe would be more favorable to their bills.
These people have very cunningly sought to create
the impression that the President is on their side, and
the Philadelphia Record claims to have authority for
the assertion that the rumors about the hostility of
the administration to the Speaker were started solely
to test public opinion and determine whether a move
ment to depose him would be popular.
The results of the test have been sufficient to con
vince all intelligent men of the firm hold the Speaker
| has upon the Republicans of the country. The Demo
i cratic organs for partisan purposes. have done and are
j doing all in their little way to keep the rumors cir
! culating and to stir up dissensions over them, but
thus far with but slight effect. Tlie Chicago Inter
Ocean is about the. only notable Republican news
paper which has declared against the Speaker, and
that paper under its present management is not the
influential organ it was a few years ago.
All these rumors of impending strife over the next
Speakership may be dismissed as idle tales. The Re
publican party is not going to be divided in 1900.
Tom Reed will be duly elected Speaker as soon as
Congress assembles, and the election will be in har
mony with the policy of the administration and the
sentiment of the people.
The geat fire at New York is said to have originated
through the throwing of a lighted match into a lace
curtain. Perhaps this is correct, but it seems doubt
ful. Why should any such complete and abject idiot
as one capable of this trick have been permitted at
large?
The farmers are perfectly willing to concede that
prayer brought the rain, and if they have any plaint it
is that the plan was not earlier put into operation. It
would have saved much fretting.
Sometimes the police are too officious. They pre
vented the killing of Butcher Becker of Chicago after
he had confessed to having slain his wife with a
hatchet and burned her body in the stove.
Most of the burglars who have been caught recently
in this city have been captured by women. Perhaps
the same women would have fainted at sight of a

SOME MOTHER LODE MINING.
- A strike of wonderfully rich ore in the
old Central Eureka mine, now being re
worked by a San Francisco company, was
made a few days ago to the excitement of
many stockholders. Ore studded heavily
with free gold estimated to run anywhere
from $500 to $5000 a ton was suddenly run
into at a depth of 1180 feet. The extent of
the ore will not be known for some time,
but it may easily mean great things for
the Central Eureka and for the whole
mother lode. AA.*A>y.'A
The flnd was made in sinking the shaft
on the incline following the hanging wall
through the gouge. Between the gouge*
and the hanging wall quartz bearing free
gold was encountered, and a blast was
put in, loosening about half a ton of rock
fairly yellow with gold. It was seen that
the shaft had cut the feather" edge of an
ore body which extended back from the
shaft along the hanging wall. Within the
limits of the shaft the layer of rich quartz
widened from one to over four Inches. To
know whether it was a small pocket or a
big ore body would require drifting on it.
It was decided to continue sinking sixty
feet further and then to drift, and until
these explorations are made nothing more
will be known. The slice of this unmeas
ured body of. ore cut off by the shaft is
probably the' richest rock encountered on
the mother lode in a good many years, ex
cept for occasional narrow seams in
quartz.
The find recalls interesting history. The
mine lies next to the Eureka mine, once
the Amador Consolidated. It was the Eu
reka that gave Alvinza Hayward his first
millions twenty-five years or more ago.
The Eureka produced $20,000,000 in Its day.
When Hayward sold the mine it went to
Michael Reese and then to the Amador
Consolidated Mining Company, of which
David Colton of railroad fame became
president and in whose hands the mine
died. In 1870 it was the deepest and great
est mine on the lode, running seventy-five
stamps and paying $155,400 in dividends
that year. Two costly fires in the mine
and other troubles resulted in the aban
donment of operations in the 70s at a
depth of 2200 feet. It has for some years
been mainly owned by Hetty Green, who
will use it for nothing but storing water.
Many efforts have been made to get Het
ty to bond or sell,' but she will neither
reopen the famous old mine nor let any
body else do so.
The Central Eureka joining it was the
old Summit mine, abandoned twenty
years ago at a depth of 700 feet. In 1569
one chimney of ore yielded $30,000 at from
$16 to $32 a ton. Another ore body yielded
$140,000. Financial and other difficulties
and the cost of mining and milling in
those days led to abandonment, and it
joined the list of "worked out" mines
that are now becoming great again.
Three years ago E. R. Randall of the
Wakelee Drug Company got up a com
pany to buy the property for $37,000 and
to sink to lower levels on the strength of
the knowledge and faith developed In re
cent years that mother lode mines carry
values at depths, and if the ledge pinches
out it will be found again below, and on
the strength of the record of the adjoin
ing Eureka. Many San Francisco and
Sutter Creek people subscribed for stock
and have to date paid 22 cents per share
in assessments and spent $125,000 in buy
ing the property, exploring upper levels
and sinking 400 feet below the old work
ings. The recent find is the first one of
importance, and it will stimulate faith in
sending that shaft down. A few weeks
ago stock was picked up at 2 cents a
share. A. Van der Naillen Jr. of this city
got rid of 1000 shares for $10 and escaped
further assessments. Last week $1 50 a
share was paid for stock unuer stress of
the strike. â ___ _ . ;-
E. C. v oorhies of Sutter Creek, who
owns a few thousand of the 400,000 shares,
brought down some of the rock and much
enthusiasm the other day.
"I showed the rock to Alvinza Hay
ward," he said, *' and his opinion is that
it is the same rich rock that came out of
the Badger shaft in the Eureka close by.
Such a find means further confidence in
deep mining in the mother lode, the ad
vertising of -the lode, increase in deep
mining and the production of millions.
Some communities would make a great
blow about such a find, but nobody ever
does any ...owing about the mother lode."
The mother lode is constantly showing
that mining its gold has hardly fairly be
gun. The Gwin, another of those old
"worked out" properties, is getting to be
a bigger thing every month under the
enterprising operations of E. C. Voorhies
and his associates, who took the old
property and risked a 1400-foot shaft on
faith. During the past week the Gwin
company contracted for an additional
forty stamps for its mill, doubling its
capacity.
"The ore body on the 1200-foot level is
21 feet thick and all average milling ore,"
said Mr. Voorhies. "On the 1400 level the
ore body is 1500 feet long, and still length
ening, with an average width of 12 feet,
! and all pay ore." y.
One of the most Important strikes of the
week was made in the Oneida mine, Ama
dor County, where a fine ore body has
been found in the 1750 level. Thomas
Mem and the London Exploration Com
pany have been spending a fortune in de
veloping this old mine with a great past,
and there is every promise that the story
of the Kennedy, Argonaut, Gwin and
other mother lode properties opened at
depth will be repeated. The Oneida joins
the Kennedy on the north.
THE BIG ARGONAUT-KENNEDY BAT
TLE FOR MOTHER LODE RICHES.
Mining men are greatly interested in the
Argonaut-Kennedy suit, in which Judge
Nicol of the Superior Court of Calaveras
County rendered an important decision
last week granting the Argonaut claims to
mining ground trespassed on by the Ken
nedy company and giving the plaintiff
judgment for about $115,000, the net value
of. ore extracted by the Kennedy com
pany. , , .
The case is an interesting example of
the working of the American law of
extralateral rights, the Kennedy lying on
the north of the Argonaut, which is the
old Pioneer mine so successfully reopened
by San Francisco capitalists. The two
claims lie along the same main vein of the
mother lode in Amador County, the
Oneida joining the Kennedy on the north.
The vein dips to the east at an angle of
about 60 degrees and hence soon passes
with depth beyond the side lines of the
claims. Joining the Argonaut and Ken
nedy claims on the east and also joining
each other are the Argonaut and Kennedy
mill sites. The inclined vein passes un
der these mill sites in which open the
shafts of the respective mines. The terri
tory for some distance to the east is cov
ered with quartz claims under which the
main ledge descends, these claims cover
ing other and minor veins. The Kennedy
and Argonaut companies, of course, may
follow into any ground beyond their own
side lines, the vein having its apex or top
within the surface boundaries of their
claims, but keeping within their own end
lines projected downward. *
A thousandfeet or so east of the Ar
gonaut and Kennedy claims is the Silva
mine, a small patented claim owned by
the Kennedy company. The inclined Ken
nedy shaft in Its great depth of 2000 feet
passes clear under the Silva ground,
reaching the line of its western side at
1550 feet. The line separating the Argo
naut and Pioneer patented claims passes,
when projected, through the Silva claim.
The Argonaut shaft descends on the in
cline parallel to the Kennedy shaft and
but about 500 feet south of it. The Argo
naut shaft in following the main vein
downward also passes under the Silva
claim. It is as to the right of the Ken
nedy people to cross, within the surface
limits of their Silva claim, the projected
line of the southern boundary of the Ken
nedy mine and to extract the ore of the
main ledge there that the big legal battle
has arisen. The Argonaut people claim
the right to follow their ledge under the
Silva claim, owned by the Kennedy Com
pany. This right would ordinarily not be
disputed, of course, but the contention
arises, as in all other extralateral right
battles, from peculiar circumstances. The
side lines of the Argonaut claim are not
parallel. The projection of its- two end
lines \ would describe a wedge-shaped
form, the divergence being about fifteen
degrees. In following its 1500 feet of ledge
wherever it may lead with depth, shall
the Argonaut company follow its north
ern or its southern end line? As the rich
ore bodies worked by both companies -lie
about the northern end of the Argonaut
and the southern end of the Kennedy
claims, the Argonaut people naturally
considered only their northern boundary
_ The Kennedy shaft being several hun
dred feet deeper than the Argonaut shaft
reached the depths below the Silva claim
when the rival shaft had not. Under the
Silva boundaries the Kennedy company
ran drifts southward at various levels
i from 1250 to 1750. feet to the limits of its
claim as determined by its own surface
end line. Then it crossed the line into
the rich ore which the Argonaut people
expected to reach with their shaft one of
these days. About 5600 tons were extract
ed by the Kennedy company across the
line before its rival succeeded in stop
ping it, about four years ago. The Ken
nedy company justified its operations by
saying that as the end lines of the Argo
naut claim were not parallel the Argo
naut company had no extralateral right
to follow its vein under the property of
the Kennedy company, and that in the
absence of such a right the Kennedy com
pany was entitled to all the ledge in
closed by the side lines !of the Silva |
claim projected vertically downward. The j
Kennedy company drew a line parallel to j
tho southern instead of; the northern j
boundary of the Kennedy .claim and left |
a great wedge-shaped section ' of the i
vein in dispute. Its total value migut ex- I
ceed a million dollars. A temporary in- |
junction was Issued in 1890 and the case j
has just been decided in the Superior
Court of Calaveras County, to which it j
was transferred. The case was submitted â 
and argued on an agreed statement ot ,
facts as purely a question of law. The
chief legal point was as to the require- ;
ment that the Argonaut end lines must I
be parallel. Judge Curtis H. Lindley of ;
counsel for the Argonaut side thus states j
the effect, of the decision:
"The real point in the case was whether i
the Argonaut company had any extralat- ,
eral right by reason of the non-par- â¢
allelism of its end lines, inasmuch as the
Argonaut patent was issued before the
act of 1872 requiring end lines to be par
allel was passed. The court held that its j
extralateral right was determined wholly |
by the act of 1866, and that the case was |
in respects similar to the Eureka-Rich
mond case decided by Judges Field, Saw- j
yer and Hillyer and affirmed by the |
United States Supreme Court, wherein j
the doctrine was announced that end lines |
are not required to be parallel under the j
law of 1866 to conform to the provisions j
governing extralateral rights." i
The Superior Court grants a permanent ,
injunction and the Argonaut company ,
wins the net value of the ores it has lost !
and a right to the riches in dispute. The i
case will be appealed, however, and it is
agreed that the disputed ground shall be j
let alone until final judgment is given.
Some interesting information is given in
the agreed statement of facts. Between j
October 8 and December 12. IS9o, the Ken
nedy company mined 2604 tons of ore |
across the line at 1500 feet or more of I
depth. Its gross value was $62,218 4 a or
about $24 a ton. The cost of its mining
and milling, was $6119 40 or only $2 34 per
ton. The net profit on this particular ore,
taken out within sixty-four days, was ,
$56,099 55. But during the year before it
appears that the Kennedy people quietly !
worked quite a bonanza over the line, for
it is charged that 3000 tons of the gross
value of $135,000 or $45 a ton was taken out. |
The State Mining Bureau has a good
deal of important work laid out for the
next two years in view of Its appropria
tion of $50,000, besides $7000 for publishing. !
The work of issuing the Register of Mines
by counties will proceed as soon as the â¢
State Printer will do the work. The reg- i
isters for a number of counties are fin- \
ished There will be much delay, how- ;
ever first, because the State Printer can i
do little until July. and. second, because
when he is ready for business there wiil
be a crush of delayed work from many :
sources. Besides the register and the ac
companying county mining maps the
State Mineralogist has prepared valuable |
mans of various oil and asphalt producing
districts and some bulletins on special ,
themes. Scientific field work will also be j
resumed. â

The Asama, armored cruiser, built at
Elswick for the Japanese navy, has been
completed. Her full power trial under nat
ural draught took place; on February 8.
when she made 20.37 knots with 13.000
horse power during a continuous run of
six hours. Two days later the forced
draught trial gave 22.07 knots with 19,000
horse power, the propellers making 158
revolutions: The Asama is 408 feet in
length, 64 feet beam and displaces 9750
tons on a draught of 24 feet 3 inches, with
a normal coal supply of 700 tons. The con
tract called for speeds of 20 and 21.2..
knots under natural and forced draught,
which were realized, although the ship's
bottom was rather foul. She is the twelfth
vessel built at Elswick for the Japanese
navy. The armor of the Asama weighs
2100 tons and consists of a belt of seven
inches Harveyized steel along the water
lineâ two feet above and five feet below
tapering to 3^ inches at the ends. Above
this is another five inches thick, which
reaches beyond the turrets and forms
with the ends a casemate. As a further
protection of the bow torpedo tube there
is a belt extending from the stem
twenty-five feet aft. The main deck
is of two thicknesses of one-half inch
steel and the ammunition tubes are three
inches thick. The upper deck is covered
with teak, which is practically the only
woodwork on the ship. The main arma
ment consists of four eight-inch quick
firers with six-inch Harvey steel housings.
Two of these guns are forward at an ele
vation of twenty-five feet and two aft at
a height of twenty-four feet above the
water line. Ten six-inch quick-firing guns
are carried in casemates, and four of the
same caliber on the upper deck behind
shields. .
THAT COMPROMISE.
To the Editor: Our public school teach
ers at last seem to be about to receive a
portion of their November and December
salaries. The proposition of the "mer
chant creditors" to allow them to receive
one-half month's salary will be consid

teachers will do well to accept the olive
branch tendered by the merchants. There
undoubtedly Is right on both sides and a
mutual understanding in regard to their
differences is wise.
Unquestionably the teachers should re
ceive pay for the work performed, and
with equal justice the merchants should
receive pay for the goods delivered, and
as there is not money enough for them to
receive pay for their demands In full, they
will show good judgment in coming to
gether, and each receiving a part settle
ment. BaWm . Â
While there may be some chance for tne
teachers to obtain their salaries in the fu
ture it should be remembered that the
old adage "a bird in the hand is worth
two In the bush" is just as true now as
when first uttered; besides a compromise
as offered will in no way affect the likeli
hood of the final receipt of their salaries,
unless it be that it will add to that desir
able possibility. A TEACHER.

THE APOSTLES' CREEDâ Mrs. S. L.,"
Fresno, Cal. It is not known who pre
pared the Apostles' Creed. It was held by
many early writers that it was composed
by the Apostles themselves, who, during
their stay at Jerusalem, agreed upon it.
There is no mention in the Acts of the
Apostles, or in the writings of those who
immediately followed them, of any gath
ering of these holy men for the purpose of
formulating a creed, and had there been
such a meeting it is probable that there
would have been some record of it. Dr.
Schaff says: "Though it is not in form
the production of the Apostles, it is a
faithful compend of their doctrines, and
comprehends the leading articles of the
faith in the tribune of God and His revela
tion from the creation to the life everlast
ing in sublime simplicity, in unsurpass
able brevity, in the most beautiful order
and with liturgical solemnity."
THE BOTKIN CASEâ A Reader, Oat
Hill, Cal. "Upon the presentation of the
papers in the Botkin case in the earlier
stages there was sufficient evidence to
show that a crime had been committed
and that there was reasonable ground to
suppose that the party accused had com
mitted it, but upon the presentation of
the extradition papers to Governor Budd
it was made to appear that the crime had
been committed in two States, and he had
a right to decline issuing his warrant on
the extradition papers for the reason that
the accused could be tried in either State,
and the accused was tried in this State,
found guilty and sentenced to imprison
ment for life. The warrant was not re
fused by Governor Budd on the ground
that there was not sufficient evidence to
try the accused in the State of Delaware.

The transports are being got ready for
their voyage to Manila and three or four
of them may get away this week. The
Cleveland will get away at noon to-day.
Up to Saturday night 1260 tons of cargo
had been put aboard her and 100 tons
more was to be loaded during this morn
ing. As soon as that work is done the
vessel is to sail at once. She will be fol
lowed by the Charles Nelson, Zealandla
and City of Puebla.
The Charles Nelson will go on the
Union' Iron "Works drydock to-morrow.
During the run from Seattle here she lost
one of the blades of her propeller and
a new wheel has to be put on. She will
come off the drydock Wednesday after
noon and will begin loading for the
Philippines at Mission-street wharf on
Thursday. She will take away about 900
tons of cargo and 100 soldiers and Red
Cross nurses. It is expected that the
Kelson will be loaded and ready to sail by
Saturday afternoon.
The City of-Puebla is taking on stores
at Broadway wharf and will be ready to
sail as soon as the troops who are to go
down on her arrive. She has been thor
oughly overhauled and placed in first
class condition for the voyage. The re
pairs to the Zealandia are almost com
pleted and it will not be long before she
is ready for another voyage to Manila.
The provisioning of the vessel will not
take long, and as soon as the troops for
her arrive she will be ready to sail.
All the steamers will be dispatched be
fore the Government begins loading the
"wind jammers." The British ship
Bidston Hill is now at section 3 of the
seawall and can be got ready to receive
cargo in a few hours' time. She will
carry about 3500 tons of general mer
chandise, and should make the run down
in less than fifty days at this time of the
year. It was rumored yesterday that
the British ship Leicester Castle had
also been chartered by the Government.
She avas scheduled to go to Taltal, South
America, in ballast to load nitrate for
England, but it now looks as though all
that had been changed and she was going
to accompany the Bidston Hill to
Manila. Should the vessels get anything
like c-uick dispatch at the other end, they
will be able to come back here in ballast
and still be in time for a grain charter.
The Leicester Castle is now at Lombard

takes her, will load there.

TWO HARBOR COMMISSIONERS
APPOINTED BY GOVERNOR GAGE
PARIS KILBURN and F. S. Chadbourne, the newly appointed Harbor Com
missioners, are two of the best known citizens of San Francisco. Both have
held at dlifferent times important offices under the State and Federal Gov
ernments and have always acquitted themselves with credit.
Mr Kilburn was Surveyor of the Port during the Harrison administration, and
while acting as such earned the respect and esteem of the whole shipping commu
nity After retiring from the Surveyorship he was one of the State's Bank Com
missioners but went out of office while Governor Budd was in power. His four
years' service on the water front as Surveyor of the Port should stand him in
good stead now that he has been appointed president of the Board of Harbor
Commissioners. -'â "_â -â  _.â¢â¢_._
Mr Chadbourne, should he succeed Mr. Herold, will be going back to a posi
tion that he filled with honor during Governor Markham's term of office. He was
for years colonel on the Governor's staff and also paymaster of the National
Guard of California. As Harbor Commissioner he made a record for fairness
among the shipping men that will make them welcome his return. In this respect
Mr Heroic! has left nothing to be desired, and a more hard working or conscien
tious Harbor Commissioner has never sat in the board. However, if he must go
it will be because of the fortunes of politics.

EXPEDITION LEAVES
FOR LATUYA BAY
WILL DEVELOP RICH GOLD
PLACERS IN ALASKA.
Steamer Dora Takes Thirty Men and
Provisions for Six Months.
Tragic Death Recalled.
The steamer Dora left this port on Fri
day last for Alaska in the interest of the
Satuya Bay Gold Placer Alining Com
pany, which was lately incorporated with
a capital of $10,000,000. The directors of
the corporation are Bernard J. Stahl of
New York, president; M. Blaskower, vice
president; Louis Levison, treasurer; O.
H. Savage, secretary; Dr. Oscar J. May
er, director, the last four named being
all residents of this city. Of the first
issue of 100,000 shares all but 7000 have
been taken up. A number of offers have
been received from parties desiring
to buy the property outright. An
English syndicate offered to purchase
51 per cent of the stock and wanted an
option for ninety days, but the company
finally decided to refuse all offers and
develop the property on its own respon
sibility.
The result was the fitting out of the ex
pedition on the Dora, which was char
tered from the Alaska Commercial Com
pany. Five thousand . dollars' worth of
groceries alone were purchased, besides
a large quantity of other necessaries suf
ficient for six months. Thirty men are in
the party under contract to work on the
company's mining properties, the super
intendent being J. Adams. The steamer
also took a lot of mining machinery,
which was made in this city.
The Satuya Bay property is probably
the largest in Alaska, being ten and a
half miles in extent. Samples have been
brought out which assayed remarkably
high and .warrants the putting in of so
large a capital. -Mr. Stahl, the president
and one of the largest stockholders in the
concern, will go to Alaska in June or
July on a visit of inspection. . *
This expedition recalls the tragic death
of Lewis Myers at the burning of the
Baldwin Hotel. He was a guest at the
house and managed to carry out his
trunk with some assistance, and when
about a block away he became faint and
expired from heart failure superinduced
by the great excitement. He was secre
tary of the Satuya Bay Company, and
all "the papers relating to its formation,
deeds etc., to the mining properties were
stolen from his trunk on the sidewalk
and every vestige of his personal be
longings also disappeared. The papers,
being of no value except to the owners,
were thrown away by the thieves and
were afterward found in a tin box about
two blocks away from the scene of My
ers' death. . _

HOTEL IN GREAT STYLE.
Only Sixteen Years of Age, but Had a
Great Longing to See a Little
of the Outside

John T. Moran, 16 years of age, could
not resist the temptation to steal $1250
from the safe of his employer, and now he
Is on his way back to New York State to
stand trial on a charge of grand larceny.
A week ago last Friday Chief Lees re
ceived a dispatch from the Sheriff of Her
kimer County, N. V., asking him to arrest
the boy, who was heading for this city.
The chief detailed Detectives Dinan and
Reynolds on the case, and they ascer
tained that he was a guest at the Palace
Hotel. They kept watch on the hotel, and
early the following Sunday morning the
boy was arrested as he was going to his
room. He was taken to the City Prison
and locked up in the tanks. The Sheriff
was promptly notified of the arrest, and
he sent a reply that Deputy Sheriff James
Conkling had left to take the boy back.
When Moran was searched $785 was
found in his pockets. He had purchased
a bicycle for $40, a satchel for $10 and a
pair of shoes for $5. The articles had not
been delivered and the detectives got the
storekeepers to refund the money, making
a total of $840.
Moran accounted for the loss of the
other money by saying that while he was
asleep in the railroad depot in Chicago
waiting for the train some thief stole $190
from his pocket, and in Denver he pur
chased a -watch for $30. The rest of the
money he spent for railroad fare and
personal expenses. Deputy Sheriff Conk
ling arrived here Saturday, and on call
ing upon Moran in the City Prison he said
he was willing to go back without any
fuss.
He was attending school in Ilion N. V
and in his spare moments helped John
A. Giblin, a coal dealer there, to keep
his books and run messages. When asked
why he stole the money he said he saw
it in the safe with other money and could
not resist the temptation of taking it
with the object of having a good time
and seeing a little of the world. He is a
nice looking boy and is dressed in the
height of fashion. He did not appear to
realize that he had been guilty of any
serious crime and took it more as a joke
than anything else.
Deputy Sheriff Conkling left on yester
day afternoon's train for liion and Mo
ran willingly accompanied him. If he had
been here a few days longer before being
captured very little of the money would
have been left, as his tastes were ex
travagant. '

EXPOSITION BILL
IN GAGE'S HANDS
Promoters of the Great Enterprise
Confident the Governor Will
Sigo It.
Chairmao Reinstein PoiQts Out the Slight
Foundation for the Oppositioo to
the Exposition
:A'-..7'---
NOW that the bill appropriating $250,
--000 for the proposed Pacific Ocean
and International Exposition has
passed the Legislature the projectors
of the enterprise are confident that it will
meet with the approval of the Governor,
who will have ten days from 'last Satur
day in which to affix his signature to the
measure and thus make the funds avail
able.
It is claimed by the most influential
members of the exposition committee that
the arguments made against the project
are the result of a lack of understanding
as to the objects of it and its cost to the
taxpayers of the State.
It Is proposed to endeavor to remove
these unfounded prejudices by calling a
special meeting of the general committee
of the exposition on Tuesday for the pur
pose of discussing the matter fully and
giving to the people of the entire State a
correct presentation of the situation.
. J. B. Reinsteln, chairman of the general
committee, feels certain that the slight
opposition that has manifested itself to
the exposition will disappear when the
facts are all clearly set forth. Among the
many strong points he made In favor of
the exposition, In the course of an Inter
view yesterday, was that San Francisco,
where the exposition is to be held, stands
to contribute $5 25 for every dollar that is
paid by the interior taxpayer for the es
tablishment of the fair. He also demon
strated that the tax on each Interior prop
erty owner would not exceed 22 cents a
year for two years. ââ-tÂ«.iÂ«_
"This bill was passed by the Legisla
ture," he said, "on a Practical pledge that
San Francisco would put up $700,000 If the
State would put up $250,000. therefore the
passage of this appropriation by the Leg
islature commits San Francisco to the
proposition that $750,000 shall be appro
priated by the Board of Supervisors.
P "The next thing in order I. to have a
meeting of the general committee which
will be called for Tuesday at 3:30 p. m. at
The rooms of the Chamber of Commerce,
there to discuss ways and means of ob
taining greater unanimity on the part of
all the forces that are expected to further

holding" of the fair, mainly in the country
and because it was thought that the State
would be required to appropriate 1600,
--000 tasted of $250,000 such opposition
was based largely on tnat fact and as
much because it then seemed that the
State would have the misfortune of an
other dry year. Sentiment in the country
on this subject has changed greatly be
â¢ , u of the smaller appropriation and
the general rains, and the opposition to
thi holding of the fair will become. less
and less, in my judgment, as the objects
and purposes and results of holding this
exposition become better and more clearly
U "OnTof the main objects of the meeting
of the general committee will be to devise
means of Informing the people of this
State thoroughly concerning the advan
tages of the fair, and also to answer some
of the arguments against the exposition
which its supporters consider are not well
founded. A committee will be appointed
to procure and give publicity to statistics,
showing the effects of expositions simi
lar to the one contemplated, although no
exposition of the past will have had either
the same opportunity or the same pur
pose for Its creation.
"It seems to be the general opinion
among the members of the committee
that this exposition should be largely de
voted to the purpose of Increasing t~e
commerce and strengthening the indus
trial position of the State of California.
It is to be in no sense a theatrical expo

be entirely subordinated to the purpose of

"This is a serious and strictly business
enterprise, and the aid of the people of
this State is sought solely on pure busi
ness principles. The persons who will be
interested are expected to learn the op
portunities for the interchange of the
products of their respective countries.
San Francisco is fixed as the place for
the holding of such an exposition because
it affords the best opportunity and is the
best situated to give such an object les
son.
"It has been suggested that large num
bers of people outside of our State will
not come to this exposition, but if none
of such persons come the State of Cali

reap an ample return for the money ex

more comprehensive knowledge of their

countries which will exhibit their prod

business enterprises in such countries to
better understand their respective needs
and wants. But the exposition projectors
maintain that it is necessary for the
State of California and the city of San
Francisco to establish in the eyes of the
world, If for no other purpose, simply for
their prestige, the natural resources of
the State and the splendid position of San

should spend a smaller amount of money
and give a display of our products at the
expositions to be held at Toledo, Buffalo
and St. Louis. We feel this would be a
grave mistake, and that we are infinitely
more likely to be benefited by holding
an exposition in the city of San Francisco
of the products showing the possibilities
of the commerce of the Pacific Ocean than
by any display of the products of each
State in the cities of the East. Nor do
we think, by any means, that more people
would see and be impressed by such a
small display in the cities of the East
than would result from a great exposition
in the city of San Francisco.
"The matter of the cost of holding the
exposition contemplated has been grossly
exaggerated. Such cost will not be great
er than the amount already guaranteed
by the State and this city and promised
by the national Government, which is
$1,500,000. While a larger amount will be
expended this extra amount, over and
j above the million .and a half, will be
I paid almost entirely out of the conces-
I sions and the receipts of the exposition,
and every dollar which will be paid by
the citizens of this State for the estab
lishment of the exposition will result in
the education of our people to a larger
and fuller appreciation and a better
grounded and more general belief in the
future greatness of the State and city.
"Of the $250,000 which has been appro
priated by the Legislature of the State
I one-third will be paid by the city of San
i Francisco, leaving about $100,000 to be
contributed to this exposition by the
! State outside the city of San Francisco.
The total tax levy for the next two years
Is something over $12,000,000, and the total
amount to be contributed by the country
â$100,000â is, therefore, not much more
than 1 per cent of the amount of the en
tire tax levy. With the $750,000 San
Francisco will contribute separately to
the enterprise, she will be giving $540,000
to the country's $160,000, or in the propor
tion to $5 25 to the country's $1.
"The average assessed value per capita
of property to persons in the country will
probably not exceed $3000, and each per
son's share of the tax to maintain this
exposition would not exceed 44 cents, pay
able in two annual Installments.
"London is to England, Berlin to Ger
many, Vienna to Austria and Paris to
France, what San Francisco is to Califor
nia. No matter what criticism of San
Francisco's right to the exposition may
have been indulged in. and even perhaps
justly, the fact remains that the metrop
olis of a country ana the country at large
have mutual Interests and must stand
or fall together."

gardingthe Senatorship.
Oakland Oflice San Francisco Call.
90S Broadway, March 19.
Senator Perkins returned home from
' Washington to-day just in time to learn
' from Sacramento that he would be the
.sole representative of California in the
United States Senate for the next two
years. For this condition of affairs Sen
ator Perkins disclaims all responsibility,
for he says that he kept his hands off of
the entire business, nor could he be ca
joled into expressing any other sentiment
than that a Republican Senator would be
elected to succeed Senator White, pro
priety restraining him from expressing
any preference.
"It is unfortunate for California," said
the Senator, "that this deadlock has oc
curred, for this, growing State has need of
all Its representation in the Senate. There
are so many important rests demand
ing attention that 1 deeply regret the Ina
bility of the Legislature to elect a Sen
ator. Did I have any preference among
the candidates? None whatever. I re
ceived letters and telegrams by the score
asking questions regarding the situation,
but 1 replied to all that it would be very
unbecoming for me to take a hand in the
contest. 1 was in Washington to repre
sent California, and this is an arduous,
honored and important task. It would
have been very bad taste on my part to
have attempted to influence legislators on
such an important question when I was
not even acquainted with the details of
the contest.
. "Senator Hanna received several tele
grams from California asking him, as
chairman of the national committee, to
do all in his power to insure the election
of a Senator and induce the Legislature
to go into caucus, but he sent back but
one reply. He said he had confidence in
the good judgment of the Republican par
ty and that it would do what would be
best without advice from him. Senator
Hanna, like other Republican representa
tives and friends of the administration,
deplored the deadlock, but he would not
tender any advice regarding individual
candidates."
In response to a query. Senator Per
kins said he would rather not say who
the parties or the Influences were that
tried to induce Senator Hanna to get the
California Legislature to get into caucus.
"In my third speech in Congress I ad
vocated the election of United States
Senators by direct vote of the people, and
1 am glad to see that -my views are now
becoming popular."
According to the views expressed by
Senator Perkins on the Philippine ques
tion there has been a great deal of grat
uitous assumption on the part of certain
to-called Republican leaders regarding
the policy of President McKinley and his
Cabinet. When the sober second thought
comes to the American mind Senator Per
kins predicts a marked change in senti
ment.
" 1 might say that the administration
has no settled policy regarding the future
of the Philippines," said the Senator.
"When the peace treaty came before
the Senate 1 asfced the Legislature of Cal
ifornia for instructions, and they wished
me to vote for it. I did so. This course
was necessary, because if the treaty had
failed of passage we should have returned
to the situation we were in before the
armistice with Spain was declared. This
would have been an indefensible policy.
A year and a half ago the administration
would not have entertained the idea of
annexing the Philippines, but after the
battle of Manila a new complexion was
put on affairt. We had to do as we have
done, but 1 do not believe the administra
tion has any desire to annex the Philip
pines. I am hopeful that a Washington
or a Lafayette will arise who will be
- able to establish a stable government un
der a protectorate, that will ultimately
develop into an independent republic. I
think that after America has been in
strumental in restoring peace and pros
perity to those islands, and has started
them on their way to certain progress,
shÂ». should retain an adequate naval
depot and coaling station and retire with
honor and dignity.
"I have great faith in the sober second
thought of the American people. I do
not now^iear of any sentiment in favor
of making the Philippines a State, and I
believe that before long we shall hear
little of annexation. We are a business
like nation, and when we consider that
the total imports and exports of the
islands are $20,000,000 a year and that our
present army in Manila and other places
costs us $60,000,000, I think patriotism will
find its practical level.
"Nor is this all. Let me tell you some
thing that the average man does not
know. It costs $2000 per year to send,
maintain and pay each soldier in the
Philippines, and this is independent of
the fearful death rate and the ultimate
pension list for the next generation. The
Philippines are aliens and 90 per cent of
them never heard of this country and
cannot possibly be graduated into Ameri
can citizens.
"On the other hand there is the trade '
issue. The annexation of the Philippines j
will undoubtedly bring new trade to the |
Pacific coast. 1 can state that even now j
Eastern capital is seeking to establish |
several lines of steamships on this coast. !
Do not run away with the idea that I am |
not an expansionist. I am an expansion
ist of the most expansive type. I would,
however, proceed along the lines of those
grand old Americans who have built up
the republic of to-day from the nucleus of
the original thirteen States. I would favor
the purchase of British Columbia, the an
nexation of Canada, of Mexico, of the
Whole of this continent, but I do not favor i
the granting of statehood to the Philip- :
pine Islands or to any territory with
whose Inhabitants we cannot assimilate.
It is a mistake to assume that the policy j
of the administration is to permanently I
annex the Philippines, for this is not the |
case. President McKinley is proceeding
with caution, firmness and great wisdom, :
and the republic can rely on its leader.
The next twelve months will produce
great development, and I am not descend
ing to flattery when I say that the admin
istration will prove its complete ability
to deal with this great question. In the
Senate 1 can say there is no general feel
ing In favor of annexation at this time."
Senator Perkins has no doubt as to who
will be the choice of the Republican party
for President next year. Nothing short of ,
a miracle or folly can prevent the re-elec- I
â¢ tion of President McKinley.
"There is not, and perhaps never has
been, a more popular man in the United
States than President McKinley," said
Senator Perkins. "Nothing can prevent
his renomination and re-election His
popularity and the public admiration for
his ability are daily growing. It is pos- ;
Bible that there may be those who will
differ from him in his war and foreign
policy, but it will not hurt the party for
it will, I believe, all be adjusted within
the party. It will be to the "interests of
certain political factions to stir up dis
sensions, but the pendulum will have to '
swing far in the opposite direction from
its present position before any doubt can
arise as to the result of the next general
election."
Senator Perkins desires to pronounce an '
anathema upon the plans for the San
Francisco Postofflce. He says they are ,
better fitted for a jail or warehouse than
a large and costly Federal building, "it
will be an eyesore and a disgrace to the
City," he said, "and Senator Tillman told
the truth when he. said the plans re
sembled those of a Southern cotton gin.
"Two large appropriations have been
made this session," said Senator Perkins,
"for the naval training school on Goat
Island. There are already 400 boys en
listed, and it will soon be possible to have [
â¢ . â -â**-â  . â 
2500 apprentices in training. This is a
grand work and Is destined to American
ize the navy. At present 57*6 per cent of
the navy are foreigners. There Is no
reason why this should not be quickly
changed so that not less than 90 per cent
will be Americans."
"THE MODERN TROJAN HORSE."
Rev. Dr. Locke Lectures on the Evils
of the Present Generation.
"The Modern Trojan Horse" was the
subject of Rev. Charles B. Locke's dis
course at the Central Methodist Church
on Mission street last night. He likened
the struggle between ancient Greek and
Trojan to the conflict of to-day between
right and wrong; and drew a resemblance
between the strategy employed in the
capture of Troy and the methods by
which the evil one seeks to destroy men's
souls. In part Dr. Locke said:
"The old story of the long conflict be
tween the Grecians and Trojans, and how
what could not be accomplished by Gre
cian prowess was effected by Grecian
strategy, and after ten years of hard
fighting, by means of a hundred warriors*
concealed within the huge wooden horse,
Troy was overthrown and the beautiful
Helen was taken home to Greece. Con
tinuing, Dr. Locke said:
I have asked your attention to the recital of
this ancient legend because it alarmingly illus
trates what is being done in these bright end
of the century days. The long struggle between
right and wrong has been continuing through
the years, and now the devil seeks to take
the world by strategy. Mankind has fallen an
easy lev to the scheme for its overthrow. The
wooden horse has been dragged into the citadel
of our civilization and warriors bold, nends
incarnate, have gone forth on their career ot
devastation and death.
Covetousness, avarice, infidelity, dissipation,
selfishness and all "the works of the nesn,
have been let loose upon the world and have
wrought the destruction of character. It Is the
mission of Jesus Christ in the world to give to
each individual an armor of light by which he
may not only be able to successfully meet all
these arch enemies of righteousness in his per
sonal character, but as a brave contestant may
aid in bringing about the utter defeat and
annihilation of all the machinations of the
The most murderous of all of these enemies
is cruel selfishness; that demoniacal possession
which for the sake of gain murders and de
spises and crushes all who come in the way of
the accomplishment of Its base Â£â &*. â )s
A fundamental principle of Christianity Is
"bear ye one another's burdens and so fulfill
thVUtw of Christ." and when this benign law
has been adored 'by each individual then will
men organize such a mighty opposition to the
evUs that victimize society to-day that multi
tudes of slaves to vice shall be emancipated,
and an army of deadly foes shall be annihi
lated. . - â
GOLFERS ON THE
OAKLAND LINKS
MEN'S HANDICAP CONTEST IS
NEARLY CONCLUDED.
Miss Duff Wins the Ladies' Competi
tion in Approaching and Putting.
The Presidio Links.
Owing to their elevation and the sandy
nature of the soil, the Presidio links dry
very rapidly and can be used for play the
day after a heavy rainstorm. Several
players were out on Friday afternoon,
among them being J. W. Byrne, who went
around the course twice, in 53 and 58; it.
B Chase, who registered scores of 99 and
101 and W. B. Bo wen, whose returns were
101 and 99. E. J. McCutchen, C. Page, C.
P Eells J. W. Byrne, Leonard Chenery,
Mr Gay'lord and several others were out
for* practice on Saturday afternoon. The
competitions in driving and approaching,
for men, set down in the programme for
Saturday, did not come off.
There were many players out on the
links at Oakland, some of whom were
taking part in various club competitions,
while others were playing friendly match
es or getting into form for the next meet
ins with the picked team of the San
Francisco Golf Club. The match play com
petition, eighteen holes, with handicap,
which was begun on March 11, reaching
the third round, has now advanced a
stage further. The results in the third
round were as follows: G. D. Greenwood
(scratch) beat D. F. Belden (scratch), o
up; R. Cooke (scratch) beat W. A. Magee
(4) 6 up; A. Goodall (5) beat T. Rickard
(7) 1 up; W. P. Johnson (3) beat J. C. Mc-
Kee ( scratch), 5 up and 4 to play.
In the fourth round G. D. Greenwood
(scratch) is drawn against R. Cooke
(scratch), and W. P. Johnson (3) has de
feated Arthur Goodall (5), 4 up. The win
ner of the Greenwood-Cooke match will
play in the final heat against W. P. John-
The only entries for the competition in
putting and approaching among the ladles
were Miss Agnes Duff and Miss Eleanor
M Davenport. The competition in the
same departments of the game was en
tered by the following gentlemen: T. R.
Hutchinson, R. M. Fitzgerald, E. R. Fol
ger and Arestes Pierce. The ninth green
was marked by concentric circles, like a
target, the outer circle having a radius of
twenty-five feet and the next one a radius
of twelve feet. In the putting competition
the player had eight shots for the hole
from any point on the circumference of
the outer circle; if he holed the ball his
shot counted 100 points; if he putted it
within the inmost circle he received 75
points; the third circle counted 50 points
and the fourth 25.
In the approaching competition the con
testants played for the green from dis
tances of 100, 75, 50 and 25 yardsâ one ball
at each distance. If the contestant played
onto the green from the 100-yard or 75
--yard marks he scored 10; if he played his
ball within the 12-foot circle from the 50
--yard or 25-yard marks he scored 10 points.
The points made in both the putting and
approaching contests were added togeth
er. The ladies' prize for the highest ag
gregate score was won by Miss Agnes
Duff, and the gentlemen's prize for the
highest total fell to T. R. Hutchinson.
The match play competition, eighteen
holes, with handicap, will be played off
as may prove convenient to the contest
ants. Next Saturday, March 25, there will
be a ladies' competition, match play, with

EX-LIEUTENANT BENNETT
IN THE FROZEN NORTH
He Says That With Machinery and
Capital Great Wealth Can Be
Taken From the Sands.
Ex-Lieutenant of Police George W.
Bennett, who was pensioned by the Police
Commissioners a year ago and immediate
ly started for the frozen north In quest
of wealth, has written to friends in this
city relating his experiences and fortune
since he sailed from the Golden Gate.
During the month of November he, with
another miner, Charles Rvdell, was ap
pointed at a meeting of miners held in
Circle City to investigate .the office of
Recorder Blake at St. Michael. The men
started from the mines at Gullivan Bay
down the Cheenik River in a schooner.
The sailor at -the tiller, unfamiliar with
the river, grounded the vessel forty-five
miles past the point of destination, and a
leak caused the passengers and crew to
walk to the settlement. Bennett and his
companions then attempted to return to
Gullivan Bay, a distance of 250 miles, on
foot. During the journey Bennett
sprained his ankle on the slippery ground,
and being in the rear and unable to at
tract the attention of his companions re
mained for several hours in a perilous
condition until his friends returned. ..
In speaking of the mines Bennett says
that with a dredger and suction pump
enough gold could be taken from the beds
of the rivers to i.quidate the Spanish war
debt. When the ex-lieutenant of police
arrived at Gullivan Bay a year ago he
pitched the second tent in the vicinity.
Now, he says, there are between four and
five hundred, and the prospects are that
the number will be doubled when the ice
on the river breaks and permits naviga
tion. His claims run along the river for
a distance of about two and a half miles,
and comprise the better portion of the
auriferous river bed. Since his arrival
he has disposed of twenty-one claims at
a good price, but intends to retain his
other claims, believing that some of
them will produce fortunes when they
can be properly worked.

A "SHIRT- WALK" IS
THE LATEST FAD
Hot Contest in Which Some Excessive Tear-
Provokers Were Displayed.
THE "Shirt Walk" has arrived in town.
It is not a rival of the cake walk,
but is a new fad for the young men
who find pleasure in arraying them
selves in shirts that obviate the necessity

j of having a steam heater In the neigh-

I There are several gentlemen in this city
who are promoting high art and opulence
in the shirt industry by their earnest ef
forts to "put it onto" the other fellow in
the matter of hot linen raiment, and as
they could never agree as to who had the
"real thing." some bright mind suggested
that they have a "shirt walk." The idea
was eagerly adopted, arrangements were
made and the unique exhibition was held
% in the private dining apartments of a
swell uptown restaurant on Saturday
evening.
The contestants were Dan O'Callahan,
the well-known commission merchant;
Jeff Bolton, the engraver; "Billy" Kenne
dy; Colonel Al Andrews; "Kid" Blazer,
the horseman; "Wiliam J. O'Brien, the
tenor, and Charlie Newman. Competitive
points were arranged as follows: Neat
ness, 0; harmony of effect, 50 discredits;
reasonably rank, 25 credits; quite shock
ing, 50; most repulsive and painful to the
eye, 100. The man who got the lowest
number of points was to pay for the din
ner for the crowd, including the judges.
O'Callahan appeared In an emerald
dream effect, the shirt front being re
lieved by numerous flying cranes in
white; collar to match.
Bolton's effort was shrimp pink with
small purple figures; a fiery red bow
necktie and a blue collar with perpendicu
lar red stripes.
Andrews was arrayed In a red dream,

Scores.
SAN RAFAEL, March 19.â The shooting
stands at Schuetzen Park were well filled
with marksmen to-day. notwithstanding
the inclemency of the weather, and some
good scores were made. Three clubs Were
present, the California Schuetzen Club,
the San Francisco Turner Schuetzen and
the "Verein Eintracht Shooting Section, all
holding bullseye shoots.
In the Turner shoot John Utschig Sr.
upheld his high standard by making the
top score of 417 points. In detail the scores

sixth. Charles Schroeder; seventh, John Zahn;
eighth, Carl Suehrstedt; ninth, H. Schwelser;
tenth, Carl yon- Hart wig; eleventh, Louis
Smith. , v ."'
The liveliest contest of the day was the
bullseye shoot of the California Schuetzen
Club, owing to the presence of a larger
number of marksmen belonging to that
organization. Despite the gray sky and
the poor light on the target, the rain and
the frequent gusts of wind, the members
of this club did as good shooting as the
most ardent sharpshooter could nave ex
pected. C. J. Walden won first money,
scoring 100; H. Enge was a close second,
with 117. The complete scores were as fol
lows:
C. J. Walden, 100; H. Enge. 117; F. E. Mason,
146; F. P. Schuster. 177; J. Straub, 316; D. W.

tinger, 1150; R. Finking, 1280; A. Breuss. 1295.
President Philo Jacoby of the California
Club brought three budding riflemen over
the center, in which was a beautiful
dazzler.
Blazer's linen displayed the spurs, whip
and cap of the jockey.
O'Brien wore what he called "a-man
from-Mexico shirt, bars all around and
nothing to drink."
Newman appeared in a hand-painted
darling, showing a frappe bottle with
corkscrew figure effects all around.
Kennedy was cool and confident, dis
playing a gem in water color, with Klon
dike suggestions such as Icicles, a mid
night sun and polar bear accompaniment.
The walk was exciting and conducted
without coat or waistcoat. Andrews was
allowed fifty discredits for "harmonious
ness." O'Brien won twenty-five points
for "reasonably rank"; Blazer was placed
in the same class, while Newman and
O'Callahan were given &0 on the score of
"quite shocking."
The honor of carrying off the palm and
sitting at the head of the table was
awarded to Bolton, the decision being
that his combination not only brought
tears to the eyes but was evidently con
ceived in the Interests of opticians.
The banquet was pulled off in jolly
shape and some of the difficult shirts
fared the same fate for eternity a few
hours later. It is stated that this initial
shirt walk has not satisfied the con
testants and that some of them are now
putting in their spare moments In strug
gling to construct a horror that will
knock out anything that has thus far

fied his recommendation that the little

names of the boys and their scores were:

and John McLaughlin, 17 rings, out of a

Cygnus down from her winter quarters
at Larkspur to Sausalito, where she will
be got ready for the season. G. T. S.
White's sloop Will o" the Wisp has come
off the ways and is having her cabin
renovated. Her owners intend to put a
new iron centerboard in. When E. C.
Bartlett's yawl Frolic comes off the San

R. H. Morrow's sloop Aeolus has been
entirely recalked and will be painted
below the water line with parafflne paint,
her stern being sheathed with lead to pro
tect it from the teredo. E. H. and Mrs.
Howard have been living on board the
sloop Speedwell during the winter at
Larkspur; next month the yacht will be
brought down to Tiburon. On Tuesday
night ex-Commodore I. Gutte's luckless
schooner Chispa dragged her moorings
and went ashore on the beach, but with
out doing herself serious injury. Ex-Com
modore G. S. Billings' sloop Nixie has
been on Frank Stone's ways at Tiburon
all winter. The Aeolus is also on the
ways, but will be launched next week.
Work on H. Simpkins' new yawl is pro
gressing. The owners of the sloop Clara
nave not as yet made up their plans for
the season.
Over on Oakland Creek the yacht own
ers of the California Club are actively
at work preparing their boats for the
season. The sloop Pactolus is being
thoroughly overhauled at Jules Hart
man's wharf.
At the Oakland navy race held last
Sunday all the canoes except the Nereid
came to grief.
The Oakland Canoe Club has got out
its sailing programme for the season of
1599, which has been prepared by Dr. S.
A. Hackett, H. G. Hinckley and Charles
L. Taylor Jr., Dr. Hackett being club
measurer and hand! capper. ,
Oliver Ortley and W. B. Ortley of the
South Bay Yacht Club have acquired a
steam vessel, which will be of great as
sistance to the yachts when they run
aground In the shoals near Alviso. The
bill appropriating a considerable sum for
the improvement of the Alviso channel
has passed.
PLACED UNDER ARREST.
Lieutenant Neall Reports to Colonel
Compton at the Presidio.
Lieutenant Neall, Fourth Cavalry, re
ported to Colonel Compton, commanding
the Presidio, yesterday morning. The
cavalryman was formally placed under
arrest by his superior officer. This
means that Lieutenant Neall will be con
fined to his quarters until his case has
been disposed of by the military authori
ties. In yesterday's Call was published
the facts in connection with the return
of the officer from Mexico. He has come
back on the advice of friends to stand
trial and make good his shortages.
Colonel Compton would not discuss the
case yesterday. He merely stated that
Lieutenant Neall had reported to him
and that he had ordered him under ar
rest. He refused to say what would be
done in the case. Lieutenant Neall has
made good his public indebtedness. Ma
jor General Shaffer was notified yester
day of Lieutenant* Neall'B return. The
next few days will develop what will be
the outcome of the case. It la highly
probable that Colonel Compton will pre
fer formal charges against the officer and
that he will be court-martialed, but he
has it in his power to let him off with a
reprimand. r '
The men of Troop B. which was com
manded by Lieutenant Neall, were de
lighted at his return. One of them said
yesterday:
"It would take very little time to
acquit the lieutenant if the men of his
own troop were on the court-martial." A
number of the officer's friends called on
him yesterday.

CHOYNSKI AND THE
KID ARE NOW READY
ENTERTAIN VISITORS AT THEIR
TRAINING QUARTERS.
McCoy Will Quit Work Wednesday
and Joe Will Take Light Exer
cise From Now On.
Neither a pelting rain nor a heavy south
wind deterred about twenty sports from
visiting the training a-'arters of Choynski
at Ingleside and of McCoy at the Casino
yesterday. The "Kid" disappointed them,
however, for he observed the day of rest,
but Joe satisfied their curiosity by giving
them a complete performance of his ath
letic abilities.
The visitors drove first to McCoy's
quarters and then to Choynski's. All the
coaxing that the lovers of pugilistic prep
aration could muster for the occasion was
inefficacious when directed toward the
Easterner. He said he was in ripe con
dition and that his body needed rest. He
was lively of spirit and invited them all
to see him at work during the next three
days, for he will cease training on Wed
nesday, holding off from all manner of
exercise until he steps In the ring Friday
night.
Choynski, under the eye of Graney, gave
an exhibition of what he can do when
called upon. A hot bout with McConnell
and one or two others, bag punching and
rope skipping made the sum total of his
work yesterday. Joe jumped the rope so
well and so long that even Graney was
winded. Some of the visitors began count
ing the revolutions of the rope, but they
soon became lost In inextricable mazes.
Eddie Graney at the conclusion of the
performance claimed he had kept tally
and he shouted 4000. The crowd turned
round and moved toward the bar. Graney
paid for the drinks.
Light work will be the order of training
for both men during the last few days.
Sport in the Handball Court.
There was a large crowd at Ryan's
handball court yesterday to witness a
game between two young pupils of Pro
fessor Riordon, who have been in train
ing for six months. Neither of these
young athletes has seen his twentieth
birthday, yet they played a game yester
day for the medal offered by Phil Ryan
for the best amateur players frequenting
the court.
The game was single-handed and was
between M. Maguire and E. Curley. The
boys played for all they were worth, and
at the finish of one of the closest games
played in the court for a number of years
they received a round of applause from
a crowded gallery that would have made
veteran athletes proud. v â¢/ .
Their scores were as follows:
Curley won five aces and was presented
with the medal. The other scores were:

COURSING BUT
SO GAMBLING
AT INGLESIDE
Moondyne II Beats
Mac's Melody.
SLOW RACING ON WET FIELDS
FORM PLAYERS IN GREAT LUCK
AT UNION PARK.
Nearly Every Event on the Long
Programme Captured by the Fav
orite Controller Wins
the Puppy Stake.
There were about fifteen law-abiding
coursing men and twenty policemen un
der the command of Captain Dillon at the
Ingleside Coursing Park yesterday after
noon. The patrol wagon that stopped at
the entrance served but the purpose of an
ornament, for no pools were sold and the
squad of officers did not have an oppor
tunity to reduce weight through violent
exercise.
The dogs ran just the same from the be
ginning of the programme to the end.
There was no shouting of poolsellers, no
cheering or enthusiasm. The dogs were
exercised and the owners seemed satisfied.
Without the necessity of waits to give
poolsellers a chance to earn their illegal
commissions the card was run off in
speedy fashion. The entire day's sport
was completed by 3:30 p. m.
Moondyne won the stake from Mac's
Melody after a hard course. The hares
were slow on account of the heavy
ground, and a heavy rainstorm through
out the afternoon seemed to take the life
out of the dogs. The results were as fol
lows:
Tommy Rex heat Rose of Tralee: Rocket beat
Victor Queen; Regina beat Speculation; Johnny
J: beat Prince George; Moondyne 11 beat Hicks;
Las Palmas beat Seminole; Conquerer beat

If a contingent of Stanford students had
been out at Union Park yesterday and
had followed in betting the cardinal col
ors they would have come home with
their pockets weighed down with coin, as
in the first round of the open stake ten
out of fourteen dogs sporting the cardinal
colors won, and In the first round of the
puppy stake the red flag was the winning
one in every course. The sport from a
sportsman's view was very high class and
the dogs ran true to form in nearly every
instance, which made it a good day for
the talent.
The open stake was won by Lowe &
Thompson's St. Oran, who ran well all
day. Golden Rule was the runner up.
Metallic was the favorite In the betting
in the long odds book, but the Pasha Ken

in the fourth round. The puppy stake
was won by Controller, who defeated
Black Night, a promising young bitch, in
the finals with a few points to spare. The
results of the day were as follows:
Open stake, second roundâ St. Oran beat O.
K. Capitol; Snapshot beat Gold Hill; Victor
King beat Christmas Day; Jennie Wilson beat

THE BUSH-STREET NUISANCE.
Sutter-Street Company Is Responsi
ble for the Ruts Caused by
â V.'t\^ the Car Tracks.
City and County Attorney Lane has
submitted an. opinion to the Supervisors
regarding the condition of Bush street.
He fixes the responsibility for the
nuisance on the Sutter Street Â£*Â»Â»Â»Â£
Company, which formerly owned the rails
on the street. In concluding his opinion
Attorney Lane says:
"I advise that the channels or ruts now
remaining upon Bush street where the
raffs i formerly ran constitute * public
nuisance, which the city may, by civil
action brought against the Sutter Street
Railway Company, cause to be abated.

THE COMING BENCH SHOW.
Preparations for a Grand Exhibition
of High Class Dogs Are
Being Made.
The American Kennel Club's Pacific
special committee is in possession or
powers that, with slight exceptions, make
it practically independent of the Bovern
ing parent body. its first meeting will be
held on the Â»th Inst., and various matters
await its judicial decision.
The Pacific Mastiff Club held its month
ly meeting last night. Duncan S. Murray
and William H. Dick were elected d rect
ors one to replace K. Docker, and the
other as substitute for C. A. Spreckels.
vice president, now traveling in Europe.
The new rule of the American Kennel
Club limiting the validity ,of a â¢â¢listing"
to one year, excites much comment. The
rule is not altogether prejudicial to the
owners' Interests, as many will undoubt
edly prefer to register their dogs in the
stud book to paying 25 cents yearly for
the mere privilege of showing their dogs
in -i bench show. The registration gives
a certificate of the dog's pedigree and
greatly enhances his value for breeding
purposes. that in the future clubs
will be compelled to charge exhibitors the
extra 25 cents for the listing fee, as the
ax will be too heavy a drain on the
civs exchequers under the new ruling.

An Active Organization.
At a meeting of the Mission Federation
of Improvement Clubs. Saturday night,
various subjects were discussed. In which
some of the Supervisors were not kind y
mentioned. It was charged that certain
members lacked courtesy when the exec
utive committee of the federation waited
on the body while sitting as a committee.
It was broadly hinted that a poor man's
club did not meet with proper considera
tion.
A resolution was passed requesting the
Governor to veto Assembly bill 19, intro
duced by Rickard; also censuring the
Legislature for its failure to pass Mead's
bill, relating to polltax.
Dr. Charles V. Cross, president of the
Western Addition Club, requested the co
operation of the federation in stopping
interments within the city limits after
the year 1902. The federation pledged it
self "to support the proposition.
The suggestion of Chairman Dohrmann
of the Merchants' Association to raise a
special tax to meet the requirements of
outside improvements was favorably re
ceived. The federation is bound to have
the sewer constructed from Ocean View
to the bay along the bed of Islais Creek,
"dollar limit or no dollar limit."

HEAPED UPON
THE CLERGY
Helpless Catholic Priests Wan
tonly Butchered by Agui
naldo's Followers.
Father Guillen, an Augustinian Monk, Vividly
Describes the Conditions Existing in
the Unsubjugated Islands in
the Philippines.
With the arrival of thirteen Spanish
friars in this city from Manila last Friday
has come one of the most vivid, realistic
and probably truest descriptions of the
recent insurrection and rebellion in the
Philippine Islands. These men, who have
fallen under the cruel interdict of Ae:ui
naldo, narrate one of the most thrilling
stories of the cruelty and carnage that
have been wreaked and practiced through
the vengeance of the great insurgent
leader upon the Spanish priests of the
islands. Persecuted and ostracised, they
have come to this city to seek protection
from the rebel leader and the Filipinos.
They are all members of the Recolleto
Augustinian Order of Monks, and come
from the various provinces of the islands,
where they have worked indefatigably for
years among the natives. Their stay here
is, however, but temporary, as they ex
pect to sail for Panama this morning.
The story they tell of the persecution,
rapine and revolting cruelty of the Filipi
nos against the Catholic priests is prob
ably the best authentic bit of history that
has been given to the worid. In discuss
ing the implacable hatred of the natives
against the members of their own and,
in fact, all the representative orders in
the Islands they have drawn a perfect his
torical sketch of almost the entire rebel
lion, outlining its causes and predicting
Its results. Rev. Father Felix Guillen not
only voiced his own, but the sentiments of
his colleagues as well, when for the first
time last evening in an interview he gave
for publication a true and realistic con
ception of the insurrection, and an outline
of the probable outcome of the insur
gents' efforts to overthrow the American
troops and establish a nominal republic,
with Aguinaldo as the chief executive.
Father Guillen is from the little town of
Bohol, on one of the islands of the Vis
cayas. Although born and educated in
Spain, he has labored among the Filipinos
for over twenty-five years. In outlining
his impression lie said:
[The effect of the present internecine now
being waged in the Philippines on religion la
one that can be predicted and decided almost
without a doubt, and, in fact, I think, with
certainty. What the religion of the Filipinos
. will be, after the war is over, depends solely
!upon the liberality of the American constitu
tion. We all look for tolerance from your
Government, but nothing but protracted perse
cution from the Philippine monarchy, which
Aguil is endeavoring to establish under
the guise of a sham and nominal form of
government. The intelligent class of natives
are universally a Catholic people, both at heart
and in practice. They are religious in the
truest sense of the word. In proof of this It
may be said that if mass were said at 2 or 3
o'clock in the morning they would attend with
sincerity and devotion. The only "element we
fear is the so-called Indian, or lower and su
perstitious class, which goes to make up almost
the entire rank and file of Aguinaldo's army.
The political outcome of the present turbu
!lent conditions can be nothing else than com
plete subjugation and the absolute annihilation
of Aguinaldo and his followers. The Amer
ican spirit and character have already made
rapid prcgress among the natives of nearly
I every provlrce. Their only desire freedom
and this they know is impossible without the
protection of the American Government. They
want to adopt the Stars and Stripes as their
Rag. They want peace and they realize that
this is the only way of obtaining it.
The insurgents have been forced from every
Island with the exception of Panay and Luzon.
The latter they have made their stronghold, and
from there they plan their operations for the
complete subjugation of the islands. The na
tives of the other islands are not in sympathy
with them, but have i ten up the cause of the
Americans and the exiled priests. Their am
bition is to see the American- take Luzon and
destroy the power of Aguinaldo and his fol
lowers" so that they may have peace. In some
of the islands the natives have manufactured
American flags, which they raised to greet
the American troops on their mission of con
quest. Their sole reason for doing this was
gratitude to the Americans, who had pro
tected them from the vengeance of the insur
gents of Luzon. From what I have heard.
since I arrived in this country, of the general
Impress of the people regarding the rebel
lion I Infer that they attribute It solely to the
influence of Amiinaldo. This is not the case.
Although Aguinaldo is indirectly responsible to
a great extent for the present- Insurrection, he
is not responsible for It entirely.
Associated with him are four Philippine law
yers, who are, in fact, at the head of the ln
â¢Burg'ents. These men. natives by birth, were
educated in America and Paris. They are now
using their education and knowledge of gov
ernment to deceive the natives by giving ihem
a monarchical form of government in the dls
ruise of a republic. They are all members of
Aculnaido's Cabinet and work with him to
accomplish their own ambitions by furthering
his" They acknowledge him as their chief and
assist him in every way to overthrow the
existent government. They make out and
formulate the ordersâ he signs them. They plan
the atrocities against the churchâ he sanctions
them. Their ambition is to obtain all military,
civil and religious power. Assisting them are
Â«everal Philippine priests, who are desirous of
wresting the religious power from the Spanish
bishops now in charge of the Catholic Church
in the Islands. They expect to receive as a
result of their prestige with the insurgents, if
the latter succeed in overthrowing the govern
meat the sanction of the Pope to the dignities
and power which they covet.
Aguinaldo is not, as many believe, of high
birth He came from the common people, over
whom he is now trying to rule with a tyran
nical hand. In his early career he was coach
man to a priest named Fidel de Blase. About
the same time he was appointed captain of the
miiitia In the town of Bohol. In theory Aguin
aldo iÂ« a devout Catholic, as are all the mem
bers of his family. At his home in the years
gone by the priests were taught the native
language and received encouragement there to
diligently further the work of the church
The insurgents at the commencement of the
rebellion showed every indication of barbar
ism They not only mutilated the bodies of
their enemies., but they drank the blood of the
wounded that they might become valiant. This
inhumanity is yet practiced, and It Is for this
" ; .er reasons that we have been compelled
to leave the islands. Their prevailing trait of
character is stubbornness. There are very few
who rise above the level of the common herd,
and consequently they blindly and lgnorantly
follow Aguinaldo and his councilors They
have implicit confidence in his ability and
deem him a god. believing him to be te
vulnerable. It is my impression that if the
Americans can but capture the four chief sup
rvorters and advisers of Aguinaldo, already
mentioned, the rebellion will be eashy quelled.

Until this Is accomplished we can hope for
nothing but continual cruelty and carnage.
The object o" the rebellion against the
priests Is to get possession of the power which
is Invested in their office. This, as the leaders
know, can only be done by depriving them of
their liberties and battling- with the entire
population of the Islands, as the natives refuse
to consent to see us banished from them with
out stubborn resistance. By imprisoning, mur
dering and banishing they hope to wrest from
us our military, civil and religious power,
which we exercise in the various parishes un
der our control.
Although a Governor was appointed by Spain
to rule the islands, his power was simply
nominal. His principal functions were Invest
ed, by his sanction and that of those who sent
him, in the priests, who were considered to
have more Influence over the natives than any
functionary - that could possibly be sent there
to govern them by either force or a policy of
conciliation. Although this power was given
the priests, they never abused it. They recog
nized the Governor and deemed themselves
amenable to him. He controlled the various
towns in name; they governed them in reality.
For these and various other reasons, prompt- i
ed by ambition and greed for power. Aguinaldo
i and his followers' have instigated the rebel-
I lion. Knowing that they could never hope to i
get entire control of the government without
destroying the power of the priests, they have ,
j undertaken to force them to relinquish their
i influence by assassination, imprisonment and
banishment. The atrocities they still continue
to practice upon the priests are appalling.
j When tne rebellion first broke out the cap
tured priests were seized and thrown into j
prison. While there they were offered every j
indignity and insult. Their sacerdotal robes
were torn from their backs. In place of these
I no her clothing was given them save a pair :
; of the thinnest trousers and a small jacket or
coat. Once captured they are not left long to j
| meditate In their cells. Provided with their
scant Nothing they are set to work in sugar
cane fields in the hot sun. Guards are placed
over them, who compel them with the utmost j
I cruelty to work whether they are physically
able to do so or not. Their food for an entire
! day consists of a handful of rice and a little
i water, which is handed them at night. If they :
ask for more they are tortured and cruelly
abused. At night when they return from the
fields they are compelled to sleep on the bare
floors of their prison with absolutely not the
slighest covering for their aching bodies. Some
are thrown into dungeons, while others are
taken into the open squares and beaten.
The natives of the better class have shown
every disposition to help them, but they are
powerless, under pain of death, to render them
the least assistance. Food is forbidden to be
brought into the Jails, and if anybody is seen
assisting some unfortunate priest, by handing
him the least food, he is liable to extreme
punishment and even death.
Just after the rebellion commenced a Fran
ciscan friar smuggled some food into the
prison and was murdered for his trouble. He
was taken into an adjoining field and lashed to
a post, where he died from the effects of the
heat and starvation. If the priests ask for
meat the insurgents cut it from their arms or
other parts of their body and compel them to
eat it. Scores of the unfortunates have been ,
crucified and tortured In various other ways.
To escape their torture we are forced to go
into exile. Just before we left the Philippines
the insurgents made an attack on Bohol. For
tunately the inhabitants were notified and I
hastened to Cebu. where I notified the authori
ties, who sent GOO soldiers to rescue the natives
and save the town. This was successfully done :
and the insurgents were compelled to retreat.
The Indians, or low class native Filipinos,
intend to fight until they either gain their in
dependence or are vanquished. They believe
that if they die in battle their children and j
other relate I will take their places. They are
sanguine of success and place every confidence !
in the ability of Aguinaldo. Much blood will j
be shed I fear before the insurgents surrender. j
Every desire among Spanish and American in- I
habitants Is that peace will be restored In the
near future. The Augustinian monks and mem- i
bers of various other religious orders are hoping j
for the same result, that they may be per- i
mitted to go back to their parishes In the I
provinces and resume their work among the
natives.
When the American soldiers first landed in
the islands the natives accused them of cow- |
ardice, saying they were afraid of the saber.
This impression, however, has given place to ;
a realization of the fact that the Americans are
even braver than the most stubborn Filipinos. !
From November of last year until February !
of the present year I was compelled to seek j
protection In a convent in Manila, where I |
was garrisoned with three companies of the
Colorado regiment. While there I undertook
to teach the men the best way of living in the
Philippines. T showed them the proper food
to eat and the necessary method of living to
be pursued in order to retain their health and
protect themselves from disease. All the priests ;
who have not left the islands are at Manila
under the protection of the Americans.

GAMBLING GAME NEARLY
BESETS IN BLOODSHED
HiiMers Seel to Start a War, tit Are
by Intervention of tie Sii Companies.
In a game of fantan one Chinaman touched the money which a country
man of his had wagered, yesterday afternoon, and the act nearly caused a
bloody war. The intervention of the different heads of the Six Companies
prevented bloodshed, which the police expected, and would have been inev
itable had not the authorities been notified and means taken to prevent an.
outbreak. i â¢ ,
Yesterday afternoon a game was in progress at a 'merchants club in
Chinatown. Some dozen Mongolians were venturing their money on the
beans, when one, a member of the Suey Sing Tong. thinking he had won
the small amount ventured, sought to "rake in" 40 cents lying on the table.
Another of the players, a member of the Hop Sings, claimed the money and
an animated discussion ensued. This trouble was arranged satisfactorily as
every one expected and the game went on.
While it was believed that the trouble over the disputed "pot" was at an
end, the two men implicated in the controversy knew the matter had not been
arranged satisfactorily. Each watched for an opportunity to do the other
an injury. The game continued for several hours, and as neither of the Chi
namen who had participated in the first quarrel saw his chance, the fan
tan game was uninterrupted.
The Suey Sing man, whose 40 'cents had gone to swell the wealth of the
Hop Sing man. determined upon revenge. In the course of the game a large
amount 'of money appeared on the table. The Hop Sing, who had been play
ing in luck, displayed several stacks in front of him. This display of wealth
on the part of his enemy irritated the other, who had been losing, and his
superstition tempted him to seek to "queer" the Hop Sing.
Cautiously reaching over he touched the pile of gold stacked up in front
of his adversary. This action, according to the superstition of the gam
blers, meant that the luck which the Hop Sing had been enjoying should
transfer itself to the Suey Sing. There was a row as soon as the money was
touched, and a free-for-all fight, in which Hop Sing and Suey Sing members
took part, started.! Bloody noses and black eyes appeared in less time than
it takes to tell it. The managers of the house quieted the disturbance and
the men engaged In the game departed. Â£ â 
This, however, was not the end of the trouble. Meetings of the Suey Sings
and the Hop Sings were called and each tong declared war on the other. Lieu
tenant Price was notified of the threatened war by the manager of the gam
bling club, where the quarrel began, and he immediately made preparations
for trouble. The members of the squad were told of the threatened war and
warned to look out for shooting. It was soon known throughout Chinatown
that the police were cognizant of the fact that a fight was brewing, and this
information caused the Six Companies to attempt to stop the war.
The See Yup Company, to which both the Suey Sings and Hop Sings be
long, held a meeting last evening and sought to bring the two fighting tongs
together. Just what transpired at this meeting, which was secret, is not
known, but the police were informed that the trouble between the Suey
Sings and Hop Sings was satisfactorily adjusted.

LIFE AND HOPE
FOR "THE MAN
WITH THE HOE"
Two Boons for the
Cheerless Worker.
j LIGHTEN LABOR'S BURDENS
i MISSION OF ALLIED AMERICA
AND ENGLAND.
The Man Without a Hoe, Without a
Friend or a Penny More to Be
Pitied, Says Rev. William
Bader.
"The Man With the Hoe" was the topic
of the morning sermon by Rev. William
I Rader in the Third Congregational Church
i yesterday. The speaker took for his text
the very apt command contained In Gen
esis iii:l9: "In the sweat of thy face
shalt thou eat bread." Dr. Rader spoke
; in part as follows: â¢.,'. â /'-
"There are three instruments of civiliza
: tionâ hoÂ£, the pen and the sword.
They symbolize, respectively, labor, expres
! sion and force. The hoe Is the symbol of
j the redemption of the soil, the recovery
! of the earth under our feet. This was the
i first dream of the earliest barbarianâ the
mastery of the field.
"The pen is one of a trinity. The pen,
the brush and the chisel sympolize ex
; pression in literature and art.
"The sword stands for might. It is in
vested with government, law and force.
The pen. It is said, is mightier than the
' sword, and it may be truthfully said that
as an actual force in the civilization of
the world the hoe is mightier than the
i pen.
"Millet has painted a picture called 'The
Man With the Hoe.' He describes a
French peasant leaning, with horny
' hands, on the rough implement of labor.
; He does not own probably the clods under
his feet or the hoe in his hands. There
: he stands in the hold, the embodiment of
1 industrial despair.
"To Professor Markham of Oakland be
longs the honor of giving to this picture
its most perfect interpretation. lam sure
1 you who have read his lines will not ac
cuse me of extravagance when I rank his
j poem with Kipling's 'Recessional' and
i 'The White Man's Burden.'
"The artist has put into this face the
; idea of work. 'Work,' says Ruskin, 'is re
| ligion.' Carlyle, too, called it religion. So
] does every man who has honestly and
l cheerfully labored. Men may work by
I their hands, their minds or their souls; all
I are not fitted for manual labor. The work
j of the higher man is the poorest paid.
; Witness Dante and Milton and what they
1 received for their dreams. Dungeons and
I bitter salt, says Ruskin. Stephen was
1 paid in stones for the greatest of sermons.
Goodyear, who gave the world the use of
'.. rubber, died a pauper.
"Labor is religion, laziness a crime. The
' busiest people are not always the great
! est workers. They are sometimes like
: wheels, spinning without flax.
"Work without hope is put into this
i man's face. ' Under the sunburnt skin is
j drudgery. In the wrinkles are laid
j away the noblest passions of the heart
as in graves. It is the deadly routine,
without hope, that crushes. Thousands
: of people work hard without any hope of
getting rid of debt, lifting the mortgage
or giving John money to go to college.
Hard work with nothing ahead but pov
erty takes the light out of the face. It
takes away imagination, self respect and
faith.
"The duty of the Christian nations is
not to conquer the world, but to elevate
the world already under their flags. The
duty of Christian America and England
is to restore to the face of labor the light
of imagination, respect and religion. Let
us twine our flags together for this di
vine purpose.
"Professor Markham has called this
man a 'thing.' There are no 'things' in
a land of free institutions, free schools
and ballot-boxes, and yet some of our
laboring men have almost been reduced
to the level of the European peasant.
Even our negroes had sunshine back of
their black skins. They believed in soul.
"There are three lessons to be learned.
First, the deep tragedy of the labor
world, a tragedy enacted all about us, in
the battle for bread. Second, that mak
ing a living is not the end of life. Work
is not an end in Itself. You who educate
your sons to make a living only make a
mistake. Life is not meat and drink and
houses and carriages. 'A living' is some
thing man places under his feet and
reaches the stars. It is an advantage.
It Is an opportunity. Third, the man with
out the hoe Is more to be pitied than the
man with the hoe. He who died In a lodg
ing-house last week without a hoe, a
friend, a penny, and was laid away in the
potter's fieldâ oh. he is the pathetic pic
ture of civilization." _Â>â¢ ..-:
A Shoestore Burglary.
Shortly after 12 o'clock Saturday night a
burglar broke into Stelnbogk's shoe store,
256 Ninth street, by cutting through the
wall of a vacant house next door, then
through a second wall into the shoe store.
The visitor took several pairs of shoes,
fitting a pair on himself and leaving his
old shoes as a reminder of his visit. The
burglary was well planned and carried
out.
SALVATION ARMY
SELF-DENIAL WEEK
SPECIAL MEETINGS IN THE DIE-
EERENT CORPS.
A "Pony Altar" for Public Collections
Will Be Led by an Army Lassie
Around the City.
This Is self-denial week in the Salva
tion Army all over the United States.
The object is to raise funds for the for
eign and home missions of the organiza
tion, and special services with peculiar
features will be held every evening at
the different posts for this purpose. At
the headquarters on Market street to
night will be "Target Night," in which
the members of the army will be instruct
ed in their duties of gathering in the col
lections. Tuesday night Lieutenant Col
onel Evans, assisted by the Golden Gate
Guards band, will conduct the I meeting.
Wednesday the lieutenant colonel and
Mrs. Evans will conduct a missionary
meeting. Thursday night Staff Captain
Mrs. Dunham will speak. Friday night
Staff Captain Reid and Ensign Neil will
hold a big social meeting. Saturday night
Ensign Withers will lead a junior demon
stration in which the Chinese children
and others will take part. Sunday after
noon there will be an altar built in the
hall, and all the collections of the week
will be deposited thereon.
Altars will be placed at the street cor
ners where a Salvation lassie and a deco
rated collection box will receive whatever
money may be donated by the public dur
ing the week. Another odd feature will
be a wee Shetland pony burdened with a
collection altar and lead around the city.
This will be called the "pony altar," and
it is expected that the little horse will
return to headquarters loaded down with
missionary donations.

Proof That All the Intellect of Oak

Politics.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call, j
90S Broadway, March 19.
If anybody be. seeking diversion he
ahould migrate to Oakland and obtain a
residence there long enough to enable him
to run for office. He will not feel that he |
Is a stranger on account of his ambition, ;
for the practice has become a habit. Out
of every two dozen men you meet whoso
faces are at all familiar at least eighteen
of them have "also ran." Nor is this habit
spasmodic. It is constitutional, for the
Oakiander has not yet been found who
Will confess that he is a "has been." It
flatters his vanity and ambition to believe
that he is a "yet" and this idea is only !
dispelled by a funeral.
The past week has been one of comic :
opera. Henry Clay Baraabee has done j
very well at the Macdonough, but his
efforts are Insignificant compared to the
comic opera of last Monday, which
had for its stage the seven wards of this
city. This kind of amusement is not com
plete without its clown. Oakland's farce
was presented with more clowns than le
gitimates. Â'â¢,'Â» .i ,
Robbed of all its "asides," Monday Â«<
experience demonstrated one great prin
cipleâthat to be successful In Oakland a
candidate must either have a good Repub
lican nomination or own a brewery.
To a man who has lived on land all his j
life Monday's election must have been |
funny, but to any one who has passed a j
decade at sea it revives all kinds of un- j
pleasant comparisons. There is a good !
deal of similarity between beating against
a head wind and running for office. When
the candidate heaves up his anchor in the
convention and drifts out with the tide a
quick passage is assured him to the end
of his journey. Everything goes swim
mingly and each day based on "dead reck
oning"âthe deadest of reckoningâ he
pricks off his position on the chart along :
the course which is going to land him in
office. On paper a splendid showing is
made and no rocks or shoals are in sight, .
everybody goes along with the good fel
low and a successful trip is assured until ;
the sun comes out and some bearings are
taken, or until the ballot-box shows the
'falsity of the "dead reckoning." Then
adverse currents, leeway of friends, un
known rocks of combination are* all dis- j
covered and the unlucky navigator who
vainly persuaded himself that he was in
â¢command of a first-class clipper realizes
that he has been trying to beat against
â wind and tide in some kind of an old Chi
nese flat-bottomed junk that could not ,
get to windward even if it hud a tug .
ahead of it.
It is always easy to induce a successful
candidate to talk. It is not nearly so
easy to enter into the confidence of one
of the army of the unsuccessful. When
they know their doom they creep into
their holes and for weeks, as a rule,
nothing is seen of them. Whey they re
appear the election is a thing of the past,
merely an incident in their memories, and
something not to be discussed with rel
ish. A couple of days ago one of the un
fortunates ran across my path, and under
the promise of secrecy he consented to let
me into a few of his secrets.
"It isn't so bad after all," said he.
"You have such lots of company. 'x he
only way in which the average Oaklander
Is remembered is by his record as a run
ner for office. Somebody has said that;
the only time an Oaklander runs is when
an office is in sight, but this is grossly
untrue, and I shall not deign to contra
dict it. I always thought I knew all
about it, but it is one thing to surmise
and peep through the curtain, and an
other thing to go behind the scenes ana
experiment a little on your own behalf.
The first peep you get you think you are
looking through a cameraâ everything is
upside down from what you thought it
was. You realize the immeasurable gulf
existing between the candidate on the plat
form who smiles to the convention, talks
about the unsought honor and declares
his abhorrence of any one who would
seek an office instead of being drawn
toward that office by a double-team, and
the candidate who is conferring with his
executive committee as to how to raise
enough money to keep the thing going till
election day. This limit of spending mon
ey under the purity act is the biggest joke
In the campaign. The assessments alone
of some of the candidates reach their
limit, and when the hone.st aspirant _or
office mildly suggests that he cannot
come up to expectations,_or rather de
mands, the old hand at tne game quietly
suggests to him that there ought to be
â¢a friend' or two who would be willing
for the good of the cause to plunk a do
nation in the general fund, whic,h, of
course, would not appear as coming from
the candidate.
â¢ "These 'friends' are not hard to find;
they flock around you. Jt is surprising
how many friends are interested in a can
didate if he has the remotest chance, of
being of service to them ultimately. | I
hate to think of the miles I might have
walked trying to borrow a dollar before
I was nominated, when I found out how
easy it is to fare sumptuously after nom
ination through friends of whom I had
never previously heard.
"It doesn't do to be too modest. The
more people that have an interest in you,
the more there are anxious for your suc
cess. I made a big mistake, I declined
to borrow and was foolish enough not to
be an object of Interest to an army
of creditors, and, consequently, no one
"cared how I Cared. This is an errorâ no
debtors, no workers.
"A little campaign is an eye-opener.
There are some humiliating features to It.
For instance, it is not pleasant on your
way home to run across a vacant lot and
see it adorned with hundreds of impres
sions of a face you are well acquainted
with if you shave yourself. It is still less
pleasant to notice that the vacant lot ad-
Joins the house of a dear true friend who
had promised faithfully that every card
you gave him would mean one vote. This,
however, is only a trifle. Another unhap
py episode is on looking through the re
â  turns to find that in the very precinct
where lives some one on whose veracity
you would risk your life you have not re
ceived a single vote. It takes a big ex
cuse to explain such an incident. The
meanest time of all. however, comes when
you are forced to file a detailed account of
how much the experiment cost. When I
carry my report to the city clerk I can
Imagine my friends getting out their pen
cils and figuring up just how much per
â¢ vote it cost, and I might say right here
that I guess it will come about two drinks
per red cross on the ballots.
"There is one pleasant side to this har
rowing experience. After the election
there is no lack of sympathy. You see
everybody, or nearly everybody, feels the
game- they have all been there. I console
myself with the thought of how others
must be feeling. For instance. I could im
agine M. K. Miller weeping with John L.
Davie, P. J. Keller consoling with Andy
McDonough, Bobby Graham pouring balm
on Miles Doody's wounds, and Mr. Hoi n
isch shaking hands with 'the Sector.'
Looking a little farther back I could see
Robert Fitzgerald and Seth Mann in the
procession, Thomas F. Garrity and W. W.
Camron. And after many companies have
passed In review before my memory I see
the sorrowful form of Major Woodward
bringing up the rear. t> And there are oth
ers; a town of others."
These are no doubt honest sentiments.
They have the ring of truth and experi
ence to them. But although one hundred
out of a hundred and thirty candidates
must know that they have no business
in the field, they fulfill a very useful duty.
They can console themselves with the
fact that (notwithstanding the purity law)
thousands of dollars are distributed
among the printers and bill rosters, and
although their little ambitions smack
somewhat of the tinkling of the bell on
the clown's cap. they are at least deserv
ing of some gratitude.
A few nights ago Rev. Dr. Coyle and
j Colonel Irish presented both sides of the
1 most Interesting question of the hour, the
! Philippine question, at the First Congre
â  gational Church. One might suppose that
: on a stormy night just following an elec
tion and at a meeting for men only there
would not have been a corporal's guard.
The fact that the large hall was packed
and that not a soul moved until it was
over gave rise to a hope that all the in
telligence of the community does not
center around dull politics. Many who
attended expected to hear an excuse
j that on account of the weather the af-
I fair had been postponed, but found in
stead that their dilatoriness resulted
only in their having to stand throughout
the performance Instead of getting a seat.
I And there was no music, no bonfire, no
1 fireworks, nothing but an intellectual
' feast. There is hope for Oakland, after
\ all.
â
Rev. Marshal Law is in one respect like
Professor Jordan. He can draw attention
to himself. In. to-day's little church
paper he hurls this shaft: "Those who
have been on the lookout for the tempta
tions of Lent have not been disappointed.
Melba and Sousa and the Bostonians are
here from the East during the season of
Lent. Many who had resolved not to at- i
tend the theaters during that time weak
ened and purchased tickets to one or the
other of these. Those who resisted these :
temptations will enjoy their Easter the j
better for it." If the congregations at the
Church of the Advent were slim to-day j
the cause is very plainâ do not
care to subscribe for the pleasure of be- j
ing publicly reprimanded.
In the Enquirer of Thursday last is the
following little gem, which I will quote
in its entirety: .
"The trial of Mrs. Ada Mentel for the
alleged murder of her husband in Ala
meda last December was to-day set to
begin next Thursday, if the Brandes
trial is then out of the way. Both At
torney Foote and Judge Hall are anxi
ous to get the Mentel case finished before
the Ist of April, when the trout fishing
season opens."
How would the writer of this Item
apologize for the impatience of Jurors
pressed into service at $2 per diem?

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL,, MONDAY, MARCH 20, 1899,
EAGLES TAKE
FLIGHT TO THE
OAKLAND EYRIE
Subordinate Lodge Is
Instituted.
SAN FRANCISCANS PRESENT
NEARLY TWO HUNDRED LOCAL
MEMBERS IN ATTENDANCE.
After the Installation of Officers and
Initiation of Members, a Social
Session Ends an En
joyable Day.
OAKLAND, March 19.â The rainstorm
to-day did not dampen the spirit of the 167
members of San Francisco Lodge, Fra
ternal Order of Eagles of America, who,
headed by a brass band of sixteen pieces
and accompanied by their royal goat,
crossed the bay to propagate the myster
ies of the order and institute a subordi
nate lodge in this city.
Shortly after 2 o'clock the procession of
Eagles arrived at Seventh and Webster
streets, where an escort from the new
lodge accompanied the aggregation to the
hall, corner of Twelfth and Franklin
streets, where a most royal and hearty
welcome was accorded.
The institution of the new lodge, to be
known as Oakland No. 7, which is the sec
ond of the Order of Eagles in California,
occupied the remaining hours of the aft
ernoon. Following were the instituting
officers:
Grand organizer, J. C. Mitchell of Seat
tle Lodge; Thomas Lindsay, worthy past
president; Harry Baehr, worthy presi
dent; E. L. Wagner, worthy vice presi
dent; August Pohlman, secretary; Wil
liam Clack, . treasurer; George Crowley,
Inner guard; W. P. Patton. outer guard;
James S. Cannon, conductor; R. B. Loose,
chaplain; M. F. O'Connor, Charles Fisher
and James Chetham, trustees.
The installation of officers of the new
lodge was performed to-night by the same
officiating team, and those Installed were
as follows: A. W. Baker W P. P.; L. L.
Bromwell, W. P.; D. W. Doody, W V. P.;
Charles J. Harrington, secretary; C. M.
Day, treasurer; C. Hawbacker, conduct
or- J. D. Montgomery, inner guard; â¢
George Planer, outer guard; Dr. George
L. Tait, physician; Phil Sheridan, John
Marchovich and W. S. O'Brien, trustees.
The new lodge starts out with I*l char
ter members. However, by dispensation i
the charter will remain open for about
thirty days. After the initiation of mem
bers "the first day of the new lodge was
closed with a social session, and the dele
gation from San Francisco returned by
the 11:20 train. i
The objects of the order are the frater
nal union for mutuaL benefit, protection
and social enjoyment of. all healthy and
worthy male Caucasians of the United
States and Canada over the age of 21
years. The order is scarcely over one
year in existence and San Francisco lodge i
already boasts of over 300 members.
One week from next Sunday a lodge will \
be instituted at San Jose.
A MODEL EMPLOYER.
The Lesson Taught by the Kindli
ness of Boaz.
Rev. Frederic Lee preached at the Cali
fornia-street Methodist Church last even
ing on the subject of "Boaz and Ruth, or
a Study of Capital and Labor." Boaz met
his field employes with a kindly salutation
which was returned in the same spirit.
He even ordered that sheaves of grain be
permitted to lie on the ground that the
poor gleaners might find something to
repay them for their labor. In the gener
osity of this Hebrew there is a lesson
that if learned by the employers of to-day
would bring about a condition in which
strikes, lockouts and labor struggles
would never be found. Instead of the
"God bless you" of Boaz we hear the
curses and blows and the sounds of strife
that is widening the breach between man
and man. But here is the mission of the
church to pluck out the roots of bitter
ness from the human heart and the build
ing up of charity and brotherly love.
There must be a righting before the
masses can be lifted to the high plane of
justice and righteousness. Here is the law:
"Bear ye one another's burdens, and
whatsoever ye would have men do to you,
do ye to them." .

BERKELEY TO
RE-ESTABLISH
A LOCAL COURT
Needed Legislation Is
Enacted.
RESULT OF A YEAR'S EFFORT
ROBERT EDGAR NAMED FOR THE
OFFICE.
The University Town Will Have Its
Own Legal Machinery After the
Law Has Been Complied
With.
BERKELEY, March 19.â The much
vexed question of a Justice Court for the
university town is finally settled. A tele
gram has been received from Sacramento
announcing the passage of Senate bill
249. This was the last piece of legislation
which was necessary to give Berkeley a
local judiciary, and its enactment means
that the city will have a court of its own
as soon as the formalities of law have
been complied with.
It is nearly a year since Berkeley has
had justice administered within its own
corporate limits, and during that time the
administration forces of the city have
been practically impotent. Hardly any
municipal ordinances have been enforced
for months, and as a result the matters
of delinquent saloon licenses and the sale
of liquors within the one mile limit are
notorious. Bicyclists have scorched down
the cement sidewalks of the sloping
streets, knowing that the arm of the law
was powerless to exert itself. Within a
few weeks at least the old legal machin
ery of the city will be re-established, and
the present laxity of the municipal gov
ernment will cease. . : * .
Ever since the old local court was de
clared unconstitutional by the Supreme
Court a year ago various attempts have
been made to have a new one established
upon a constitutional new one The Board
n a constitutional basis. The Board
of Trustees, the Good Government Club
and the North Berkeley Improvement
Club worked side by side to this end.
Their first attempt to amend the free
holders' charter at a special election
failed utterly, principally for the reason
that the terms of the amendment called
for an appointive Justice instead of one
elected by the city. Their only recourse
was Sacramento, and since the opening
of the Legislature they have labored in
defatigably for the needed legislation.
Two provisions were necessary. The
first was to obtain the passage of a bill
empowering cities of over 10,000 inhabit
ants to have a Justice Court. The second
was to amend the classification act so
that cities, instead of reckoning their pop
ulation by the Federal census of 1890. can
take a census of their inhabitants when
ever the municipal government deems it
necessary, such a census to be regarded
as official. This latter provision is the \
substance of Senate bill 249, which now
gives the university town a court of Its
own. â . v><
The preliminaries of taking a census are
to be begun immediately after the next
meeting of the Board of Trusteers. The
Board of Supervisors will then be asked
to appoint a Justice of the Peace for
Berkeley, the appointment holding until
the next city election. It is generally
understood that the office will fall to Rob
ert Edgar, as a petition in his favor has
been signed by all the members of the
Board. of Trustees.

HE SHOT TO STOP
THE HORSES BUT
KILLED THE BOY
Deputy Sheriff Desirello's Tale
of the Colma Tragedy.
Young Johnson's Slayer Expresses Re
morse for His Fatal Act-His Story
Flatly Contradicted.
FRED DESIRELLO, the Deputy Sher
iff and Constable who killed young
James Johnson at Colma Saturday
evening-, expresses the deepest re
morse at the fatal consequence of his act,
and earnestly protests that he did not in
tend to injure any one of the three boys
When he fired three shots at them. He de
clares that he believed the team, behind
which "Jack" Viccari, "Jim" Johnson
and Henry Jensen were riding, was run
ning away, and he "aimed at the horses.
Desirello further said he had once be
fore stopped a runaway team with a bul
let from his pistol, and to save the boys,
whom he thought were in danger, and
to prevent a possible collision with an
other team, he Impulsively drew his pistol
and began shooting. But he does not ex
plain why he ran after the team and con
tinued his fusillade when the boys had
passed him and he could not possibly
have hit either of the horses.
Desirello's story of the crime differs ma
terially from the statements of Henry
Jensen and "Jack" Vacarri, who so nar
rowly escaped the fate of their compan
ion. Both boys maintain .that the horses
were not running away, neither were they
being driven rapidly. The youths assert
that the team was traveling on an ordin
ary trot. A dozen people around Col-da
who have seen the horses dally for
months are emphatic in stating that the
animals were common farm "plugs" and
could not under any circumstances get up
sufficient speed to be dangerous to any
one.
The prisoner denies that, after young
Johnson jumped from the wagon and
was dying, he threatened to shoot Vac
carl, but Lllile and Ida Reun, sisters
aged 16 and 18, heard Desirello utter the
threat, and they urged young Vaccari to
remain silent, as the tone of the threat
implied its speedy execution. Desirello
can make no excuse which will in any
way mitigate his offense. Even accepting
his story as sincere, he was a dangerous
man, reckless in the use of a pistol, and
not even skilled in the handling of such
a weapon. As an officer he was of course
privileged to carry arms, but he was not
licensed to shoot down horses which
might be trotting rapidly.
Desirello sat in the Sheriff's office in
the jail at Redwood City yesterday and
gave his version of the tragedy. He had
evidently passed a sleepless night, and
the realization of what he had done rest
ed heavily upon him. His wife, who is
woefully distressed because of her hus
band's recklessness, was with him all the
forenoon. She was in a grocery store at
Colma when the fatal bullet penetrated
Johnson's neck, and when she rushed out
and saw what had happened she vainly
endeavored to stanch the blood. â¢ She
placed her hands over the wound, but it
was a futile effort, as no power on earth
could have saved the boy. Desirello was
asked why he shot at the boys, and he
replied:
"My God! I did not want to hurt any of
them. I thought the horses were running
away and I shot at them. I hardly knew
the poor boy who is dead, and had no
motive in killing him." He then gave a
detailed account of his part in the tragedy
as follows: -, : - .' : . 'â '__
"I went to Union Coursing Park in the
afternoon, and to be prepared for any
serious trouble which might arise I put
my pistol in my pocket. 1 do not always
carry a weapon, and during my six years
service as Deputy Sheriff I never had oc
casion to use a gun. I am not a gun
fighter and am not an expert shot.
"When the dog races were over I went
to Colma and about 7 o'clock I was stand
ing near the White House, waiting for a
car to go to Baden. My wife was in a
store purchasing some groceries. Billy
Murphy, the dog owner, was standing
â with me, and we saw a team coming
down the road at a breakneck speed.
Billy remarked 'There's a runaway. The
next instant the horses passed us, and I
pulled my pistol and fired. The wagon
was then about ten yards from me. The
team did not stop and _ ran in the same
direction, shooting as I ran. After I fired
the third bullet I heard young Johnson
say, 'I'm phot,' and saw him jump
from the wagon. I did not think a bullet
had struck him until he sank to the side
walk In front of Belli's store. I ran over
and lifted him up and tried to stop the
flow of blood. He died in a moment or
two, and I went to Constable Nevlll and
gave myself up, asking him to take me to
Redwood. I told him what had happened
and he hitched up and brought me here.
"When I began shooting I did not know
who were in the wagon. It was dark and
I could not see the boys. They were yell
ing like Indians and I thought they were
drunken milkmen."
This statement, except as to the shoot
ing and the result, is contradicted by the
boys on the wagon and by William Mur
phy, who declares he was not near Desi
rello when he fired at the team.
When "Jack" Vaccari was going from
the ranch of J. Baumana, where he
works, to Colma he was accompanied by
James Johnson and Henry Furger, who
wished to catch an electric car. They
stopped at the switch, about thirty yards
from where Desirello was standing, and
Furger alighted and boarded a car. niie
the horses were standing young Jensen
got into the wagon and stood behind the
seat. They started for Belli's stor^, and
as they crossed the car track a man ran
"out into the road, ran back again and be
gan shooting at them. The remainder of
their story was told exclusively in yester
day's Call, and they have not changed a
single detail and there are no contradic
tions in their tales.
William Murphy, who owns a kennel
about fifty yards from the scene of the
murder, heard the shots fired and rushed
Immediately to the place where the crowd
was collecting. â¢
"I was in my kennels," he said- yester
day, "when I heard three shots fired in
quick succession. At once I left my work
and rushed over to the crowd. That is all
I know about the murder."
The. Reun sisters also ran to Belli', store
when they heard the shots, and they
heard Desirello tell Vaccari to "shut up
or he would put a bullet in him," when the
boy asked the murderer why he had killed
Jim.
Desirello's remorse and his statement
that he used his pistol recklessly to stop
an imaginary runaway does not assuage
the grief of the heartbroken relatives of
the dead boy. He was an only son and
his aged father and mother are inconsol
able. Their grief is pitiful and no kindly
intended ministrations will dry 'their
tears or relieve their heartache. Mrs
Johnson did not learn of her boy's death
until late Saturday night, and she could
not get a car through to Colma. She rode
as far as Ocean Mew and walked from
there to her daughter's home, where her
son was cold in death. The father arrive
half an hour later. The bereft parents
sat all night beside the body and were
deaf to all entreaty to leave the room. A
more pitiable case cannot be imagined.
The father's only words were:
"My' poor boy, my poor boy! I have no
one to help me any. more."
The mother's woe overcame her, and
she could only express her grief in sobs
to the friends who remained in the deso
late home.
Coroner Crowe went to Colma yesterday
forenoon and an autopsy was performed.
The following were Impaneled as jurors:
Hugh C. Rodgers, Thomas E. Kennedy,
M. Millett, Joseph Selicani, James Rodg
ers, Michael Griffin, Fred Selicani, Fred
Pierce anâ M. Callan. TJie Jury ylewed
the remains and the inquest was set for
10 a. m. Wednesday at Colma.
District Attorney J. J. Bullock was also
in Colma yesterday seeking all informa
tion which has any bearing on the crime.
The funeral of young Johnson will be
held Tuesday morning at 10 o'clock from
St. Ann's Church, Colma. Father Cooper
visited the family yesterday and offered
spiritual consolation to the weeping rela
tives of the dead boy.

"ARTHUR RODGERS RETURNS.
Will Submit Names to the University
Regents for President,
Arthur Rodgers, who has been making
an extended Eastern visit in the search
for a new president for the University of
California, arrived in this city last night
with his family and engaged apartments
at the Occidental. When he was seen by
a Call representative he said:
"Of course, you want to. see me in re
gard to the selection of a new president
for the university, but it will he impossi
ble for me to say anything definite on the
subject. I went East with the intention
of instituting inquiries as to what educa

have my individual preference, It is not
for me but for the regents to decide. We
do not desire to extend the presidency to
any one who might refuse It, anil you
can rest assured that when the man is
selected it will be one who will accept the
high office with its great responsibilities."
The question of the election of a presi

the April meeting of the board of regents,
and it is expected that a successor to
Professor Martin Kellogg will be chosen.
Professor Kellogg* resignation took ef

been serving until the selection is made.
KIDNAPED MARIE MANCO.
Mrs. O. C. Saake of Los Angeles called
at police headquarters yesterday morning
in the expectation of getting possession
of her five-year-old daughter, Mane
Manco, who was kidnaped over two years
ago, but she was disappointed.
Miss Cunningham, one of the lady man
agers of the Maria Kip Orphanage, where
the little girl has been living, and Officer
McMurray of the Society for the Protec
tion of Children, who discovered; the
child's whereabouts, were waiting, for
her. They had' a long conference, and it
was decided that if Mrs. Whittier
who it is alleged kidnaped the child and
placed her in the orphanage, does not ap
pear and make any claim for her, she
will be given into the custody of Mrs.
Saake to-morrow.
As Mrs. Whittier placed the child in the
orphanage the managers do not care to
hand her over to another person until
thoroughly. satisfied of that person's legal
right. Mrs. Saake could only refer them
to Chief Glass of Los Angeles, and Miss
Cunningham will place no obstacle in her
way if Mrs. Whittier falls to- make her

repeated the solemn words' that made
them one.
The bride's gown was of pure white
mousseline and was destitute of any orna

completely enveloped the graceful figure.
A wreath of natural orange blossoms fast

The only departure from the extreme
simplicity that characterized the entire
affair was in the matter of floral embel

is universally commended for Its prompt
action In enforcing the ordinance against
the gamblers, who have attempted to test
its validity by violating it and bringing It
before the courts.
The clerks in the courts in which these
cases are pending have been forbidden to
issue bonds for the release of any and all
gamblers who are arrested for a viola
tion of the gambling ordinance.
Probably one of the most scathing pub
which the decorator utilized with most
artistic effect. The drawing-room in
which the ceremony was performed was
converted into a veritable sweet-scented
bower, in which lilacs and roses and fruit
blossoms vied with one another to grace
the occasion. In one corner of the apart
ment a canopy of almond and peach blos
soms was erected, and there the newly
married couple stood to receive the many
salutations of their assembled guests.
Following the ceremony a bridal break
fast was served for forty. After a short

P. C
lie denunciations that were made against
the continuance of the pool gambling was
from the ministers of the gospel, who
made a vigorous crusade against It a
week ago. The subject was again taken
up last evening in many of the churches
throughout the city, and the good work
will probably continue until the curse is
entirely stamped out and the validity of
the law proven.
Among those who denounced it from
the pulpit last evening was the Rev. W.
E. Dugan of the Stewart Memorial U. P.
Church. His address in part. was as fol
lows:
Racetrack pool gambling received a death
blow on Monday night at the meeting of our
city fathers. For this our hearts rejoice and
we want to commend those Supervisors who
voted us the victory over vice. The Call of
our city deserves special commendation for the
noble fight it 'made against the racecourse
evils. It is not always that a daily will make
so bitter a fight against so vicious an evil as
this pool gambling had come to be in San
Francisco.
I have not the least doubt that the Board of
Supervisors was influenced by the way The
Call showed up the awful evils of the track.
The way this paper brought before the public
the scathing condemnation by the pulpits of
our city of this nefarious business surely had
a great effect. Pulpit and people ought to
stand by any paper that will thus fight evil.
It did us good to hear that our city fathers
had decided to stop this pool gambling and it
made our hearts leap with joy to note the
commendable manner in which Chief of Police
Lees and his worthy men carried out the order.
We have in this an illustration of the fact that
the world is getting better. One by one the
cities of the East have been driving out these
gambling parasites of society, and San Fran
cisco had become the dumping ground of the
United States for such characters and business.
But now that our city. has said to the maggots,
"You must go," I see grand evidence of the
fact that the world Is growing better.
Thugs, "bums," gamblers and their cousins
will soon have no stamping ground in the
United States unless Oakland or some of th*Â»
young cities across the bay will give these
nefarious characters a warm place In their
hearts. But I am sure that The Call, local
clergy and all decent citizens will make it
Interesting for these blood-suckers across the
bay.
In all this I see the hand of God. He permits
an evil to come up in our midst, to flourish
until our hearts have been made sick of the
gigantic monster of evil, and then His great
hand, working through human instrumentality
âthrough the press and pulpitâ wipes the
blighting curse from the face of the earth. God
uses many instrumentalities for carrying for
ward His work. The press is the mightiest
agency in this or the coming century. It is the
agency which will In all future time largely
be used to fight evil and suppress vice. Already
the Almighty has been largely using the relig
ious press for His work, but the daily and
secular press has not been generally counted
as a very great moral agency. But in The
Call's commendable attack of this pool gam
bling and in various other instances, we see
that God's arm is the power behind the dally
Civilization has taken another great step for
ward ; heaven and earth have been brought
closer together and human nature has been
elevated and mankind has Rlorifled itself once
more. Let the press In Its Rood work continue
until all evil shall cease and the kingdom of
universal peace has been ushered in.
HARRY MINER IS HERE.
Well-Known Theatrical Man Dis-
cusses Greater New York.
Harry Miner, the prominent theatrical
manager and proprietor, who represented
the Ninth District in the Fifty-fourth
Congress, has come to this coast on a
business and pleasure trip combined and
is registered at the Palace. Mr. Miner
enjoys the unique distinction of having
been the only Democrat elected in New
Tork in 1804, when David B. Hill and
nineteen others were defeated. As Mr.
Miner puts it "that was the year Tam
many was sunk." There were but three
other Democratic Congressmen from the
State, and they were Amos Cummings,
George B. McClellan and William Sultz
ner.
Mr. Miner is the proprietor of five
theaters in New York City, the Fifth
avenue, People's, Eighth-avenue, Bowery
and Miner's New Tork. He has six shows
on the road and in all employs ISOO people.
He has been actively engaged in the
theatrical business for twenty-seven
years, and he will shortly retire and
leave his interests In the hands of trust
ed lieutenants. He is a great admirer of
Richard Croker, whom he considers the
greatest organizer of the day and a man
whose word is his law. When inter
viewed yesterday Mr. Miner had this to
say : . â¢ â¢'
--"The municipal government under the
able leadership of Mayor Robert Van
Wyck is successful from every point of
view, notwithstanding that failure was
predicted for it. Improvements of great
magnitude are now being contemplated,
and under the guidance of Van Wyck,
who is a liberal and progressive man, the
improvements will be carried out. Five
new bridges will be built across East
River from New Tork to Brooklyn, to
Queens and to Williamsburg in the east
ern district. This is becoming a neces
sity by reason of the immense traffic be
tween the points named. A system of
underground railways will be running
from the Battery to Harlem to relieve
travel on the elevated roads. We have
now an underground electric street rail
way system throughout New Tork City,
and one can ride. eleven miles in any
direction for a single fare of 5 cents. We
intend to make New York the grandest
city in the world.
hen I was in Congress I was greatly
interested in the international copyright
law, introduced by Amos Cummings. Al
though we experienced almost insur
mountable obstacles we finally succeeded
in having the bill passed, and it has
proved a great boon to struggling au
thors and theatrical managers. It has
prevented the taking down of plays in
shorthand and selling the pirated copies.
The offense* is a misdemeanor and the
perpetrator is severely punished."

A meeting of the executive committee
