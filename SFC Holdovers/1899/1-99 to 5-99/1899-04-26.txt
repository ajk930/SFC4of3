HE SCORES WALES
AND THE SULTAN
FROM THE PULPIT
REV. JOSEPH PARKER.
LONDON, April 25. â The three hundredth birthday anniversary of
Oliver Cromwell has furnished the occasion for biographies, appreci
ative articles, poitraits in all the papers and celebrations in
various parts of the country in honor of the Lord Protector of the Brit
ish commonwealth.
Dr. Joseph Parker, minister of the City Temple, this city, took the
subject as the theme for his sermon this afternoon and delivered an
extraordinary oration to a large congregation. In the course of his re
marks he attacked the Prince of Wales as "a certain card-playing
Prince." After eulogizing Cromwell, Dr. Parker said:
â¢When the Prince fails, then let the country mourn. We look to
Princes for noble deeds find a high example. When I see my Prince
and my Premier on a racecourse I don't like it."
These remarks were cheered by the audience, and Dr. Parker pro
ceeded to make a rabid attack on the Sultan of Turkey, during which
he said: "Emperor William may call him his friend, but in the name of
God. the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost, I say 'God riamn tho Cul-
The preacher concluded with a passionate denunciation of the
church for accepting Protestant money for performing popish tricks.
Then, drawing from hip Bible the undertaker's bill for his wife's inter
ment, he scathingly read the word on the top of the bill "unconse
crated.' *
"Shame!" shouted Dr. Parker, and the congregation loudly re
echoed the word. Continuing, the preacher said: "When I read the
word it meant vitriol poured into a red, gaping wound. It Is a knavish
trick, a popish device. Detestable blasphemy! It made me still more
faithful to nonconformity, which made England possible to live in."

A MURDER
MYSTERY AT
PASADENA
Strange Disappearance of a
Prosperous Rancher From
His Own Dooryard.
HIS BROTHER'S STORY
The Man Who Has Vanished Was
Left Alone Less Than Twenty
Minutes.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PASADENA, April 25.â There is
every indication that a murder was
committed in Pasadena last night, but
there is not the slightest clew to the
murderer, nor has the body of the man
supposed to have been murdered been
found.
The man whose strange disappear
ance can be accounted for in no other
way is Hillary S. Starr, superintendent
of the Oak Knoll ranch at the south
end of Molino avenue, on the southeast
edge of the city. Starr lives with his
wife and two small children at the
ranch house, while his younger brother,
Charles, lives in a smaller cabin near
by. The latter was returning from this
city last evening about 8 o'clock when,
as he passed the pumphouse near the
ranch residence his brother Hillary
called to him to come and help repair
the pump, which was out of order.
Charles did so and. observing that it |
was to be a long Job, went to his cabin
to put on his old clothes.
He returned in less than twenty
minutes and found all dark, the lan
tern having been put out, and his
brother Hillary missing.
Thinking he had gone to the house
to refill the lantern with oil Charles
waited a little while, then went back
to the house only to find that his
j brother had not been there.
Then began the search, which has
continued up to the present time, with
out a single clew to the whereabouts of
the missing man having been found.
i On returning to the pumphouse Charles
found the lantern all smashed to pieces
and in the tall grass near the place
there were evidences of a struggle hay
] ing ttiKi-n place, the grass beinn:
trampled down and a bunch of keys
â  and bits of the watch chain of the miss
\ ing man being scattered about, as well
as a few nickels. and dimes from his
pockets.
There was no evidence of bloodshed,
yet the appearance of the ground
seemed to indicate that a fearful strug
gle had taken place.
To-day footprints were traced
, through an abandoned orchard from
the pump to a ravine where, near a
! large tree, a horse hitched to a light
buggy had been tied.
It is supposed that Starr's assailant
Used a sandbag or some blunt instru
ment upon his victim and then made
away with the body. Starr was a very
quiet, industrious man, strictly tem
perate and in the best of health, and
his home life was happy and. peaceful,
so his bother Bays. Hence there would
seem to be not the slightest probability
that his disappearance whs occasioned
by any freak of his own. On the con
trary everything seems to point to foul
play.
On Friday he drew $200 from the
| bank, most of which he expended soon
' after, so that it was thought he had
only about $40 in his pockets last night.
He carried a gold watch. This morn
ing his revolver was found in the grass
with three out of five cartridges
snapped but not exploded, the rest re
maining untouched.
Starr had no enemies so far as
known. He is described as a well
built man of 29, weighing ICO pounds,
height 5 feet 8% inches. Hair, eyes and
mustache brown. lie wore a gray suit
', and a brown hat. The little finger of
! the left hand has a scar at the base and
is a little crooked.

UNION n ANK MAY

Attempt Will Be Made to Recover
Securities Deposited for
Loans.
SAX JOSE, April 25. F. L. Wadhams of
Ban Francisco, at one time secretary of
the Bank Commission, was put at work
this morning expertlng the books of the
Union Sayings Bank. This will occupy
about six months.
An- ; Hemp' will be made by the direc
tors to rpcover* the securities deposited
with the San Francisco banks for loans
without redeeming thorn. These amount
to nearly $200,000. The Nevada Bank holds
about $80,000 of these securties for an In
debtedness' of $50,000. Among several
other banks are scattered $80,000 worth of
notes and mortgages in lieu of a loan of
$45,000. The San Francisco banks have of
fered to give up the securities on the
return of the amounts loaned, but the di
rectors expect t<J recover these without
putting -up a cent. The Union Savings
Bank did both a saving's and a commer
cial business, but it is claimed it had no
right to transact the latter class of busi
ness. If it can be proved it was only a
savings bank then the directors had no
light to hypothecate these securities and
they probably can be recovered. The
same will apply to the hank premises,
which were deeded to .Mrs. William H.
Wright to secure a loan of $60,000. In
case the securities are recovered from the
San Francisco banks in this way the lat
ter financial institutions can fall back on
ex-President Ward Wright and the rest
of the directors who wrecked the bank
for the amounts advanced. A long legal
battle must be fought first. Unless the
cash were forthcoming, then, it is said,
several criminal . complaints might be
made.

A SMALL BOY
ATTEMPTS TO
WRECK TRAIN
Goes About the Work in the
Most Expert Possible
Way.
SAVED BY A MIRACLE
The Officers Do Not Know What
to Do With the Little
Sinner.
Special Pisratrh to The Call.
REDLANDS, April 25.â Redlands has
the youngest train wrecker on record.
To-day, upon a warrant issued upon
complaint of Special Officer John C.
King of the Santa Fe Railroad Com
pany, a constable placed little Harry
Gregg under arrest. The boy is but
nine years old, and small for his age,
yet he is in the hands of the officers
for having attempted to wreck a Santa
Fe passenger train on Sunday.
The attempt was so cleverly planned
and executed that it seemed more the
work of a fiend than of a mere child.
The matter was kept quiet until the
perpetrator should be discovered, and
the evidence is so clear that the as
tounding fact that the attempt was
made by the youngster had to be. ac
cepted and the arrest was made.
In the Justice Court to-day the de
tails of the story were told. Harry is
the oldest of the five children of J. P.
Gregg of this city. <>n .Sunday he and
several children were playing beside
the Santa Fe track near his home, just
west cf Eastbern Station, this <ity.
Conceiving the idea that it would be
sport to see the train thrown from the
track Harry took a most effectual
method of accomplishing it.
Finding in a neighbor's dooryard a
section of steel rail about three and a
half feet long, he gathered old wire, and
placing the rail inside and close W one
of the rails of the track and bound it
firmly to the rail $=<> that the flange of
tlv wheels of tin- cars must run upon
the piece and inevitably derail the
train. Th<n. to partly conceal the work,
an old tin can, a piece of wood, a rook,
the carcass ci a chicken and other ma
terials were scattered about it and the
obstruction left.
This was nearly noon, and the next
train was due at 1:30 from San Bernar
dino via Highlands. It would bo on the
straight course on a heavy down grade
where the train runs rapidly.
A frightful smash-up- would have re
sulted had not the section foreman gone
up the track upon a handcar after
church., and thus discovered the ob
struction and cleared it away.
The chief witnesses were a little boy
7 years old, who was with young Gregg,
and described what was done in detail,
and Mrs. Jasper Glover, who lives near
the track where the obstruction was
bound upon it. and who saw young
Gregg wiring something to the track,
but had no idea that it was for the pur
pose of wrecking a train. The section
foreman and others were examined and
Harry Gregg appeared in his own be
half and denied everything. His con
duct astounds the officers and the court,
and he is so young they do not know
what to do with him.

Special Cable to The Call and the New York
Herald. Copyrighted. 1599, by James Gor
don Bennett.
MANILA. April 25.â The
â  " â  Americans took the strong
southern defenses of Galumpit
to-day. These were one mile
south of the town and on the
north bank of the Bag-bag River.
The fierce and concerted action
of Hale's flanking brigade, com
ing. from the north bank of the
river, and of Wheaton's brigade,
moving from the south along the
railway, effected this result.
General Hale's force encoun
tered the heaviest fire, but the
opposition, while heavy, was less
determined than was expected,
considering the strength of the
enemy's position.
It is assumed by the American
generals that the insurgents are
either demoralized by yesterday's
severe losses or else the greater
portion of the enemy has re
treated along the north bank of
the Rio Grande, on the southern
bank of which is the town of
Calumpit. Scouting parties
which were sent north this after
noon under General Hale found
Calumpit burning. The insur
gents began firing from the de
fenses on the north bank on
Hale's brigade. Two guns of
the Utah Battery and one Hotch
kiss did effective work in keeping
the insurgents occupied until an
armored car, with rapid-fire
guns, appeared from the south
and at short range delivered a
fierce fire upon the earthworks
beyond the river.
As the insurgents retreated
Wheaton's brigade rushed the
river, some crossing by the unin
jured portion of the bridge, the
remainder swimming. While re
treating the insurgents carried on
a sustained fire, but the American
losses were slight. Twenty were
wounded in. Hale's brigade,
seven were wounded in Whea
ton's brigade, one was killed and
three wounded in the Utah Bat
tery, and one was killed and -two
wounded on the armored . train.
The insurgent losses are un
known.
In Hale's advance down the
river last night six of- our men
were killed and eleven wounded.
They encountered ; a heavy
breastwork. General MacAr
thu.r awaits the result of the
reconnoissance northward be
fore deciding as to his future
course. If the insurgents have
retreated beyond Calumpit he
will continue to-night to Calum
pit. Otherwise he will delay un
til his wagon train can be taken
across the Ouingua River.

TOLD IN DETAIL
Colonel Funston of the Kansas Regi
ment Leads a Charge Across
the Baglay River.
MANILA, April 2fi, 10:30 p. m.â Opn
eral Mac Arthur's division fought its
way to tho Filipino trenches before
Calumpit to-day, advancing four miles,
mostly through woods and jungle and
crossing the Ragbag River. This was
accomplished at the cost to the Ameri
cans of six killed and twenty-eight
wounded, the First South Dakota Regi
ment being the heaviest loser.
After fording the river the South Da
kotans pursued the insurgents to the
outskirts of Calumpit. but the town
was found to be so strongly protected
that General Mac-Arthur deemed it best
\<> withdraw the tir^d fighters and go
into camp for a night's rest before
making the final assault.
The largest buildings in Calumpit
were being fired by the Filipinos while
thp Americans were crossing the river
fully a mile away, indicating the ene
my's intention to abandon the place.
The insurgents seem tn have adopted a
settled policy <<f retiring from one po
sition after another, after inflicting the
greatest possible damago upon the ad
vancing army. The forces to-day were
well drilled. Every foot 0* thp ground
was tenaciously disputed by thoroughly
organized troops, who stood remarka
bly firm even before artillery.
The enemy had planned to wreck our
artillery transport train. This attempt
was a failure, but one span of the iron
railway bridge over the river was de
stroyed, hampering the American
transportation for some time. The
Filipinos cut the girders, intending to
have the structure fall with the train,
but it collapsed prematurely of its own
weight.
The Bagbag River, which is about a
hundred yards wide at that point, was
splendidly fortified and the Americans
were compelled to approach an openo

In r course of an hour the Ameri
cans had forced a passage through the
woods to the open space in front of the
I river and the artillery, immediately
on wheeling into the open, began shell
ing the Filipino trenches.
In the meantime Company X, Twen

; performed one of the most brilliant
! achievements of the campaign. The
regiment was being held in reserve an'l
Company X charged a distance of a
quarter of a mile over a cornfield to
the bank of the river, near the bridge,
where the insurgents from a trench
were peppering the armored, train, then
about 200 yards down the track. The
company found shelter in a ditch.
Colonel Fred Funston called for vol
unteers to cross the river and the
colonel himself. Lieutenant Ball, a pri
vate of Company X, a private of Com
pany E, Trumpeter Barsefield and Cor
poral Ferguson of Company I crawled
along the iron girders. While this was
going on the men of Company X from
the ditch were fusillading the trenches
in the endeavor to divert attention, but
the Filipinos got the range from a
trench down the river and their bullets
soon spattered the water under the
structure. Having reached the broken
span of the bridge the small but valor
ous party of Americans slid down the
caisson, swam a few yards to the shore
and crawled up the hank, the little
colonel leading the way to the trc"chf>=.

Colonel Funston said afterward: "It I
was not much to do. We knew they i
could not shoot straight and that our

" General Hale's troops, on the right,
had the hardest fight.. They followed
the north -bank of the river nearest the
town from the east, with the First
Nebraska Regiment on the left and the
First South Dakota and the Fifty-first

M'KINLEY BOUND TO
CONQUER THE FILIPINOS
WASHINGTON, April 25.â With a large
War Department map before them, the
members of the Cabinet traced the posi
tions of the American soldiers and the
Filipinos near Calumpit to-day. Secre
tary Alger pointed out what was Intended
to be accomplished, the positions and the
strength of the opposing- forces. The
Secretary Is rather hopeful that the Fili
pinos will not be able to elude the Ameri
can forces this time. He believes that if
a large part of Apuinaldo's army could
be captuÃÂ«*r the termination of the fight- <
ing might be near.
A Cabinet officer paid this afternoon j
that the Cabinet has nt no time discussed :
the subject of the future disposition of ,
the Philippines. "It is the present that
v.-p nre thinking of." he paid, i'and -jthere
IB not the slightest intention of deviat- i
ing from the present programme. I be- i
lieve it is the unanimous feeling of the
Cabinet that nothing shall be decided :is
to the future status of the islands until ;
we have placed them satisfactorily under
the control of the United States."
He said that every" dollar and every
man necessary to bring the islands under
the dominion of this country would be i
used. When the insurgents have recog
nized the power of the I'nited States the â 
question of their future statuÃ will bo i
taken up and discussed.

Governor Gage to Reward Senator
Morehouse for Having Fath
ered Anti-Newspaper
Legislation.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, April 25.â An organiza
tion in opposition to the Republican State
Central committee is being perfected, the
object 'being to wrest the Republican
party machinery of California from the
hands of the men who are now in control.
It is said by those who are cognizant of
the movement that the preliminary stages
have long since been passed. Los Angeles
is to be the head and' center of this polit
ical "maneuver. The leaders have been se
lected and ample capital is not lacking.
That the scalps of Burns andMcLaugnlin
are the objects of the tilt by those who
ure opposed to the machine rule is' evi
denced by the statement that the leaders
of the late Grant forces will supply the
men for the ami-machine light. The on
slaught recently made on a portion of the
Los Angi-les County delegation, including
Senator Bulla, is regarded by the initiated
as the primary step in the new movement.
Senator Bulla, while declining to discuss
the language useu and the character of
the attack, favored fie plan of having the
Los Angeles delegation make a formal re
ply to the onslaught.
The story was circulated to-day that
Senator H. V. Morehouse would be ap
pointed by Governor Gape as a member of
the code commission a? a reward for his
work in obtaining the passage of the anti
newspaper legislation of the late Legis
lature, especially the signature law. More
house is said to have given out this in
formation himself.

I yielded to the pleas of the strikers and
came out from that mine to-day.
After a long meeting this afternoon the

from the Burke, Gem, Mullan and

CAROUSAL ENDS IN
A CUTTING AFFRAY
Battle in the Dark With an
Assassin in a Cabin Near
Fillmore.
VENTURA, April 25.--In a small
cabin in Sespe Canyon, about five miles
from Fillmure. Thomas B. Jefferson, a
fool dresser, about 31 years of age, was
badly slashed with a knife early yes
terday morning by a person whose
identity is not definitely known. Jef
ferson received eight or nine dangerous
cuts, besides innumerable minor
wounds. He was stabbed above the
heart; his sides were slashed and the
blade pierced a lung and his liver. The
jab in the lung probably will prove
fatal, ('liver T. Justice is imw confined
in the County Jail upon a charge of
felony, which is expected to be raised
to a charge of murder upon the death
of Jefferson, who is not expected to
live long. Jlis surgeon has said he
cannot survive.
On Sunday night between 8 and 9
o'clock Jefferson, .accompanied by Mrs.
Bradfield, and W. < '. High, accom
panied by Mrs. Fine, arrived at Jus
tice's cabin to stay for the night. High
is county agent for the Singer sewing
machine. They put up their horses and
then aroused Justice. Supper was pre
pared and served. The host was hos
pitable and a carousal followed the
meal. The guests had a half dozen
bottles of whisky with them. In an in
terview this afternoon Justice declared
all were intoxicated and bent on having
a good time. The lamps were broken
to commence with, thus causing dark
ness to prevail during the entire night.
All went well until nearly daylight,
when Justice, who claims to have been
lying upon a bed in the main room,
heard scuffling in the room. He could
not see, but he heard Jefferson cry out
that he was stabbed. He went to Jef
ferson's assistance, picking him up and
carrying him to the next room, where
he placed him upon a couch. In this
manner, he claims, his own clothes
were covered with blood.
Justice's appearance this afternoon
was that of a person recovering from a
prolonged debauch. There was a scar
above his right eye. while his left wrist
was scratched and his hands somewhat
bruised. He emphatically denied that
he did the cutting. He said either High
did it or some one followed them up.
Justice's cabin seems to have been a
stopping place for members of this
party. Justice said that though the
coming of the party was unexpected
its arrival did not surprise him. The
various nersons had been there before.
High ami Mi>\ Fin-' had called fre
quently of late. The women, both of
whom are married, called occasionally
without an escort.
Sheriff Charlebois and District At
torney Ewing spent the entire day in
vestigating the crime. A telephone
message was received this afternoon
from Pawing, who was then at Fill
more. The District Attorney obtained
the dying: man's statement
According to Jerrrmon, and his story
is partially corroborated by the women,
the party was having a drinking hout
and later retired. In the early morning
Jefferson started to go into the mom
occupied by Justice, but Justice met
him at the door and made thrusts at
him with a knife. A scuffle ensued,
during which Jefferson was repeatedly
cut by Justice. The light at this time
was Knocked over and the battle was
waged in the dark.
The District Attorney exonerates
High to a great extent. This part o-f the
story is that High was not in the house
at that time and did not know what
happened. High was in this city last
night, but departed early thfs morning
for the country.
The Fillmore section is aroused to a
high pitch of excitement. Mrs. Brad
field is the wife of Mason Bradneld,
who gained considerable notoriety some
years ago, by murdering Joe Dye in Los
Angeles. Bradfield is supposed to be in
Sacramento. Fine, the husband of Mrs.
Fine, was working in the Piru district
oil wells. Jefferson is about 31 years of
age. He has three children.
RUSSIAN ENCROACHMENTS.
Attempt to Occupy More Territory in
China.
VANCOUVER, B. C April 25.â The
steamer Emperor of China brings a story
that Russia in making further encroach

plateau to the frontier of China. A Jarge
force of Russian troops has already
marched from Pamir into the province of
Shinkyo. Officers commanding the force
declare that they have for their object
the construction of roads, but the real
object appears to be something very dif
fer* m . Chinese local authorities, report
ing the matter to the Peking Government,
declare that the Russian troops have ar
rived to occupy territory and have warned
the Government that the matter Is very
grave.
To avoid partition, the Chinese Govern

PHILADELPHIA, April 25.â 8y the
explosion <'f Seventy-five gallons of
benzol in the laboratory of Frank H.
Fleer & Co., manufacturers <>f chewing
gam at 2'.W.J Callowhill street, to-day,
two men were killed, three persons seri
ously injured and over a score of oth^r^
were more or less injured by flying
debris. The dead are:
WALTER B4ANWARING, assistant
superintendent.
CHARLES MrKIXLEV. engineer.
Of those injured, Harry Randall, an
employe, and Mrs. Giviaon and her son,
are the moat seriously hurt, but these
will recover.
The explosion was a terrific one and
for a time caused the wildest excite
ment. No less than one hundred build
ings in the vicinity, most of them small
dwellings, were damaged.
The. laboratory building was a two
story structure. At the time of the
explosion there were only four men
working in 'the building, who were pre
paring a mixture for the making of
Vanilline. The doors to the room in
which they were working were closed,
but the fumes from the benzol in some
1 manner reached the furnace in the next
room and the explosion instantly fol
lowed. Manwaring was instantly killed
I and McKinley was so badly hurt that
he died several hours later in a hos
pital. Randall's escape was remark
abl.e. He was blown through the roof
and landed on an adjoining building.
At first it was thought he was dead,
but after treatment in the hospital he
regained consciousness. Although bad
ly hurt" he will recover. George Con
ner, the fourth employe in the room,
escaped with a few severe bruiF-s.
Mrs. Giviso.n, with her child in
her arms, was hurriedly leaving her
home, which was directly opposite the
laboratory, her divss caught fire from*
â a burning ember and she and the child
were badly burned. Their recovery is
doubtful.
The explosion was so terrific that the
buildings adjoining on each side of the
laboratory were completely demolished.
on both sides "f the street, for a whole
square, th< explosion wrought destruc
tion. Windows were broken, fixtures
were smashvd and walls were cracked.
Fire added to the destruction in a num
ber of places. â¢ but the names were
extinguished before they did any con
siderable damage. The score of persons
injured were all tenants of the many
dwellings and were in no way con
nected with the laboratory. Some were
severely cut by glass, while many of
them were struck by the flying debris.
The money loss is estimated to be

EX-SENATOR WHITE
REVIEWS THE BATTLE
How Huntington's Forces, Aided
by Secretary Alger, Were
Routed.
I.Ofi ANGELES, April 25.â The people
of Los Angeles concede th;it to the tact.
judgment apd tireless perseverance of â  x-
United States Senator Stephen M. White
i- largely due the fact thru a people's
harbor at San Pedro is under construc
tion. To the accomplishment of this ob
jeci Senator White addressed himself with
.-kill and g< neralship that have
gained him additional laurels, the results
proving that he was equal t<> the emer
gency. The i>''s : ;i.iii Into which the ene
miea of the San P iro location essayed to
force him by opposing the measure did
not deter the Senator from the manlj
and open fiKht he had determined ti> make
in tin' Interests ip t" a free harbor for
Southi m < ialifornla.
In an Interview to-day with The Call
representative, Senator White detailed
the Incidents connected with the battle in
Congress and the stroki In the White
â  ti.at broke the power of the oppo
sition, led by Secretary of War Russell A.
Alger.
In commenting upon the earlj history
of San !' sdro harbor and the first efforts
to secure deep water In the harbor, Sena
tor White said thai the obstacles preced
ing the location of San i'< dro harbor
have been many and at times appeared
Insurmountable, and that In early days
San Pedro was used as an embarcadero j
for the shipment of hides, tallow and
other products of the country. Its nat
ural adaptability to the purpose for which
It is to be utilized was thus observed by
the early mariner. The iirat Improve
ments of importance attempted by the
flovernment were inaugurated in connec
tion with Wilmington, or as It Is now
called, the inner harbor, nearly thirty
years ago; and at that time there was a
depth or less than two feet at the en
trance at low tide. Dredging and jetty
construction have Bince Becured a depth
of sixteen feet at mean low tide, while
the work has been uncommonly snc<
ful. There wan no objection to its con
tinuance until Congress authorized the
appointment <>;' a board of engineers to
locate a deep water harbor on this coast
between Point Dume and Capistrano.
This board was headed I>\ ''"lonel Men
dell of San Francisco, and consisted
wholly of able engineers of the United
States army corps.
"Quite a contention developed before
that board as to tne location, said Sen
ator White, "lint after discussion they re
ported un-in m u.-ly in favor of Sin Pedro,
["hereupon followed a somewhat extraor
dinary proceeding. The very able and ef
ficient chairman of the Senate Commerce
Committee, who believed his own judg
ment superior to that of the i ngln
caused the report to be disregarded and
succeeded In ordering a new board, not
withstanding the vigorous and able oppo
sition of Hon. C. N. Felton, who was then
one of our Senators,
"The river and narbor act of that ses
sion authorized the appointment of five
United States engineers to make the in
vestigation. The new board was headed
by Colonel (afterward general) Craighill,
and consisted of five members. This
board, after full Investigation, again de
termined in favor 'â¢; Han Pedro. There
upon one of the most bitter contests that
has been had In the Senate for many
rears arose. WHen the issue was present
ed In the House no conclusion was
reached. The real tight developed In the
Commerce Committee, of which Senator
Frye_was chairman.
"Our delegation was well aware of th.'
situation, and being a member of the com
mittee I was able to voic.' our combined
judgment We went over th.- subject with
all the care and attention possible under
the circumstances. It was not a pleasant
task to antagonize the chairman of that
committee or the powerful interests thai
also advocated the cause which hi
poused. The fight had oeen going on so
long, that the older Senators had taken
sides with reference to it, and. Indeed. I
was Informed by a member of the Com
merce Committee that he had been
pledged to Santa Monica for eight >â 
Committees came from California, ex
perts and attorneys were heard, and as a
result a resolution was reported to the
Senate providing for the construction of a
water harbor at Santa Monica; thus
absolutely ignoring the unanimous recom
mendations of two United States boards
of engineers. In this view I found myself
entirely unable to concur, and 1 prepared
and tii'-d a minority report, which was
signed by Senators Berry. Caffery and
Pasco and myself, and would have been
d by Senator Vest had he been pres
ent, insisting upon San Pedro.
"Tlie report went before the Senate in
connection with numerous other provi
sions of the river and harbor bill, and
then t""k place a most serious and point
ed debate. 1 have no disposition to run
over that discussion, which was partici
pated in by many Senators on both sides.
and in which Senator Krye displayed most
remarkable ability as an advocateâ and
he is one of tlie alilest advocates 1 have
ever met. Those who favored the :i<i>.ji
tlon of the San Pedro reports. Including
myself and Senator Perkins, ntilizea
every argument at our comma-id. S<
that" the condition was precarious and
that there was no immediate hope of ob
taining an appropriation for San Pedro,
we expressed ourselves willing to trust
the matter to a. third board. To this
proposition there was great opposition,
ami finally as a compromise it was pro
posed that a board containing one naval
officer to "be detailed by the Secretary of
thi Navy, an officer of the Coast and Geo
(K Mr Survey, to be detailed by tlie super
intendent of that survey, and three ex
perienced civil engineers skilled in ripa
rian work, to be appointed by the Presi
dent, should constitute a board to exam
ine the harbors, and that the decision of
the majority of ;uch board should be
final. This beard was headed by Admi
ral Walker. It came to Ixis Angeles took
evidence, thoroughly examined into the
subject and reportedâ with the exception
of mi" member, Mr. Morgan, against
whose selection I had movt earnestly pro
tested â in favor of San Pedro.
"In view of these uniform decisions it
was thought that there would be no fur
ther difficulty, but it so happened that
the Secretary of War did not agree with
these several report? and determined to
ignore them. He at first expressed him
self as believing that the Walker report
was too ambiguous to be enforced. He
could not obtain the concurrence of the
Chief of Engineers, General Wilson, and
he thereupon referred the subject to At
torney General McKenna, who overruled
the Secretary, holding that there was
nothing in his criticism. He then declared
that lie could not advertise for bids be
cause no appropriation had been made for
that purpose. Frequent offers w< re mad.
by the newspapers of this coast to print
the necessary notices free of charge. This
he declined to accept on the pretext that
th<' Government could not accept dona
tions. Ignoring the truth that all over the
United States the Postoffice Department
accepts expensive buildings fr< â 
charge. Then sev< ral leading newspapers
expressed their willingness to print the
matter and await Congressional b
This the Secretary also declined. Mean
time the subject was referred to the
proper Treasury officer, who ruled that
there was something like 116,000 on harm.
The expenses of advertising were merely
nominal. Bids were advertised for. and
the bidders ranged all the way from the
price tixed by th<- present contractor to
the full amount allowed.
"Still the Secretary was not satisfied.
but failed to proceed, and declared his in
tention to present the act once more to
the Attorney General (then Governor
Griggrf) for construction. He assured
ral persona that he had done so, when
as a matt' r of fact he had made no such
submission. The Bession of Congress was
coming to an end. and we naturally be
came exceedingly nervous. Several of us
railed upon the President, and I !â â¢
that I there expressed my opinion of the
conduct of the Secretary of War in an
emphatic manner, and we all urged
promptness. Finally the President, alter
having looked over the situation and
having determined that the harbor ought
to be located at San Pedro, asked the
Secretary when he intended to seek the
advice of the Attorney General. Pressed
uii.itly by the executive, he was com
pelled to make the submission, and once
mon tlie matter was decided against him.
as Gei.eral Griggs promptly concurred
with Judge McKenna. After this there
â w:-.s nothing to do but let the contract.
"Perhaps there has never been any
work projected in the United States so
embarrassed by unnecessary difficulties.
.Many of those who opposed the present
Location did so in the best -of faith, but
the public will never believe, nor would
it be justified in believing, that had not
the powerful interests headed by Air.
Huntingdon been behind Santa Monica
there would have been no serious oppo
sition after the making of the Mendel!
report. Individual Senators or Represen
tatives might have expressed dissent, but
the project would have gone through.
Mr. Huntingdon has had vast experience
in Congress, has many friends there who,
recognising his great ability, find it im
possible to find him in error, and they
Implicitly follow him. Then, of course,
there is another class, to lÂ»e found every
where, who seek the approval of wealth
and power and hope for its smiles.
"During the battle which was waged
at the time of the appointment of the
Walker board the people of Los Angeles
were in a state of ferment, but the
masses and the overwhelming body of
business men, who were unawed by rail
road domination, advocated San Pedro.
A number of good citizens, however, it
must be saidâ among whom I count many
of my personal friendsâ preferred the
other "place. Now that the victory has
been achieved and the last opposing of
ficial nas been rudely thrown aside, there
ought not to be further trouble. After a
continuing contract such as that involved
here has been let, appropriations follow
as a matter of courseâ not in the river
and harbor bill, but In the general ap
propriation bill, the average amount ap
propriated being about 25 per cent for
each year. The proper amount was ap
propriated by the last Congress.
"The success with which the efforts of
those who advocated San Pedro was at
tended cannot be measured by the or
dinary embarrassments of such an un
dertaking. The character of the opposi
tion suggests Btrlklngly the necessity of
continued vigilance. Anything like pub
lic apathy, such as the election of men
who might be dominated by ulterior mo
tives, cannot hut result disastrously.
"The last Congress, at my suggestion,
ordered an examination of the inner har
bor, and when that examination has been
made it is quit*- possible That further im
provements will be accomplished. But
the construction of the breakwater pro
jected will furnish a harbor of refuge and
an anchorage for merchant vessels and
for our warships, which must be of vital
Importance, especially in view of the de
velopment of Oriental commerce."
GOVERNOR GAGE SNUBS
JUBILEE COMMITTEE
It Is Not the Habit of the
Executive to Acknowledge
Courtesies.
I.OS ANGELES. April 25.â Governor
Gage will be in the city during: this (jubi
lee) week. As the Governor's name does
not appear among the list of distinguished
speakers who will address the people at
San Pedro to-morrow, his friends are crit
icising tne management of the harbor
jubilee celebration, claiming that he has
been slighted and that he has not been ac
corded a proper place on the programme.
The officials of the jubilee combat this
Inference and bluntly state that Governor
Gage received a special invitation, in
common with 30'J other dignitaries of the
T'nited States, but that the Governor has
not replied to the invitation. They also
say that a personal invitation, through
John T. Gaffey. one of the executive com
mittee, was tendered to Mr. Gage, and
nothing is on file to show that he took the
\ slightest notice of these courtesies. This
I condition may account for the fact that
! the Governor brought no members of his
I staff to the jubilee.
MEN WHO FOUGHT
FOR THE HARBOR
Los Angeles Citizens Untiring in
Their Onslaught Upon the
Common Foe,
Three centuries ago OahriUo, the. great
navigator, who first landed on the shores
of Southern California, anchored in the
harbor of San Pedro. Cabrillo sailed Into
the harbor and christened the quiet wat
ers Bahia de los Humosâ "the bay of
smokes" â owing to the clouds of vapor
hanging over the bay, the result of In
dians burning the marsh grasses. The
name of San Pedro was given the harbor
by Viscaino. an explorer who followed
Cabrillo. This was in honor of Saint Pe
ter of Alexandria, who suffered martyr
dom in the third century, whose day in
the calendar is November 26, the date
when Viscaino entered the bay.

San Jose Defaulter Is
Arrested.
Sppcial Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, April 25.â Samuel B. Terrill.
the defaulting attorney, who hurriedly
left San Jdfp last Friday, has been arrest
ed at Nogales, Ariz., on a charge of fel
'â ny pmbf-zzlement sworn to here by Jo
seph 11. Faull. Since rrlH's departure
he has been carefully traced and to-day
it was positively known that he was in
Arizona. A notice to the Sheriffs through
r-nt Arizona soon local him at Nogales,
and on telegraphic instructions he was
placed under arrest. A Deputy Sheriff
Will be sent from here to bring him back.
T-riill's Irregularities have been nu
merous and it was only by settling his
nlil n!T;ijrs with bogus deeds and mort
gages that he was enabled to obtain time
enough to make this last break for lib
erty. He lias obtained $20,000 in all
through fraudulent mortgages and forged
deeds. As the attorney and administra
tor of the Christopher Faull estate he
lind every opportunity to defraud. Sev
eral weeks ago Judge Uyland of the Su
j.orior ('<Hirt, after an examination, found
that Terrill was indebted in the sum of
Jl'iOO to the estate. Since that time, on
the strength of a deed purporting to have
been signed by Frank JL. Haskeii, Ter
rill obtained $500 moro from the estate.
A great many of the people robbed by
Trrrill's crooked practices were miners
and email dealers in the town of Alma
den, where Terrill had at one time lived.
A few days before his fight Terrill drove
to town on some business matter. He
was at once surrounded by infuriated
men and women and nearly mobbed.
Ilocks and clubs were hurled at his head
He escaped the clutches of the angry mob

LOS ANGELES, April 25. â Governor Henry T. Gage, who arrived in Los
Anereles thfs morning from his Downey ranch, has been in consultation with
political and other friends regarding political and private business during
the day. The Governor in an interview would neither confirm nor deny the
correctness of the report sent by the Associated Press from San Francisco,
in which he is made to say:
"I have already appointed Dan Burns Senator to succeed Stephen M.
White. His commission has not been made out yet, that's all."
When pressed for a direct statement, the Governor replied: "I will not
be interviewed. The newspapers persist in publishing statements credited
to me which I have not made, and hereafter when I have anything to say
to the public on any subject I shall dictate it to a stenographer. Then I
cannot be misquoted."

Discovery of an Epidemic Which

KANSAS CITY, April 25.â A negro broken out with smallpox ami delir

evening. His capture by the police revealed the fact that the sickness is
epidemic among the negroes of that city. So far nearly thirty cases of small
pox have been found, twenty of thorn in' one thickly settled block. It ap
pears that the health authorities first made a wrong diagnosis of the dis
ease and lator. when they discovered its nature, attempted to conceal the
facts. To-nitrht a strict quarantine was established in the infected districts,
and it is hoped that the warm weather will help in stamping out the dis

representatives of and delegates from Tuolumne I
Parlor No. 144 of Bonora, most respectfully de
sire to communicate to this Grand Parlor now '
assembled that Tuolumne Parlor N*o. 144 will,
at the session of the Grand Parlor to be held
at Orovllle during April, 1900, ask that
Tuolumne Parlor and the citizens of Tuolumne
County be given an opportunity to entertain
the Grand Parlor at its regular session during
April, 1901. Very respectfully submitted.
THOMAS GORMT..EY,
GEORGE KELLY,
Delegates from Tuolumne Parlor No. 144.
Thf contest between James R. Hawkins
of Pacific Parlor and Lewis P. Byington
of Niantic Parlor for the office of grand
orator is hourly waxing warmer and is
the general topic among the delegates.
Most of the delegates are very careful in
expressing themselves as to which they
favor, but some are taking very decided
! stands, ihe country members are openly
; lining up for Byington and will make ;i
i strong fight In his favor. Hawkins has
' equally strong adherents in the persons
. of his fellow-members of Pacific Parlor
' of San FranHsco, hut he has to labor un
der the difficulty of fighting for a place
1 which five members of his own parlor out
i of a list of eight from San Francisco
I have held, and from which they have
: risen to the office of grand president
There is some opposition to Hawkins in
the San Francisco ranks, but on the
whole the fight is in the nature of a lining
; up of the city against the country. When
the question comes to a vote the election
will be warmly contested on both sides
The general indications now are that By-
Ington will come out victorious.
A measure of general importance before
the Grand Parlor is that of raising by
subscription a fund of $1 no. 000 with which
to establish a chair of California history
in the State University. It Is noi arousing
as much enthusiasm among the del
as the project deserves.
To-morrow all the delegates will go to
i Monterey. There will be no session of the
Grand Parlor during the day. but it will
j convene at 7 p. m. The "excursion to
Monterey will leave at 9 a. m. Arriving at
Monterey, the delegates will be the guests
of the Native Sons of that section. The
trip around the famous seventeen mile
drive, luncheon at Bagley's Opera-house
i and other features will be included in the
day's entertainment.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
PARIS, April According to the
Temps, a member of the Dreyfus court
martial named -Freystetter, in testifying
before the Court of Cassation yesterday,
declared that it was the evidence Riven
by Lieutenant Colonel Henry (who afi-r-,
ward confessed that he had forged a let
ter which was largely instrumental in
preventing a revision of the Dreyfus case,
and then cut his throat in prison) which
decided the court-martial to convict Drey
fus, and that the only document produced
in the presence of the prisoner was the
bordereau.
The Temps adds that another witness,
named Lupine, who was also examined
by the Court of Cassation, dwelt on the
importance of Lieutenant Colonel Henry's
evidence and testified that the inquiries
which the police were instructed to make
at the time resulted in utterly refuting
the stories to the effect that Dreyfus had
squandered money on cards and women.
The Court of Cassation has decided by a
large majority not to confront Colonel
Picquart with General Roget. It has also
been decided to make a further examina
tion of Colonel Paty dii Clam and to in
vestigate the Panizzardi telegram.
Countess Esterhazy, who to-day beg .n
proceedings for a divorce from Comma:, '.
er Comte Ferdinand Walain Esterhaz. ,
said that the publication of her husband =
letters to Jules Roche left her no other
course. She would have forgiven him the
ruin and disgrace he had brought upon
herself and her daughter, but now that
he had published degrading, groundless
details of her bodily infirmities as an ex
cuse for his own dissipation, and had also
linked her name ignominiously with that
of General Giovaninelli. she could no
longer refrain from taking the present
step. _^______â

THE REMARKABLE INCREASE IN
those diseases peculiar to women has for
the past few years been attracting the especial
attention of medical men. The delicate organ-
Ism of woman, with which her whole system
is in Immediate sympathy, renders her very
susceptible to disease. These delicate disease
wield a modifying influence ovpt the other func-
tions of the system, and for .Uia reason symp-
toms that are entirely remote from the source
of disturbance very often result.
Most chronic diseases of women are slow In
their Inception, Oftentimes disease has beon
progressing for months before the patient i 3
aware of it. Again, women are very often mis-
led on account of the sympathetic disiuroances
and will treat themselves for some affection of
the stomach, or heart, or liver, or kidneys, be-
fore the true nature of the disease is dis-
covered. .?: .
Every woman who Is sick, weak or delicat",
the result of some breaking-down of her deli-
cate organism, fully realizes the importance oi
a remedy that will cure such disorders. Hud-
van is that remedy. It has proven successful
in all of those weaknesses, and ills of women;
it has effected permanent and lasting cures.
It will do so again.
Many women are uselessly subjected to seri-
ous surgical operations that leave them In a
worse condition than ever, and that prove fatal
as often as otherwise.
The result of Hudyan in the treatment of
these delicate diseases la wonderful. It allays

charges and removes the depression of mind
that so often occurs in these cases. No remedy

that you suffer all these symptoms; in fact,
more often only two or thre of them will
be observed. It is sufficient, however, to warn
you that serious disease Is pending, and Hud-

MURDERER MOORE IS
POSITIVELY IDENTIFIED
MARTINEZ, April 25.â Ed H.
Moore, the slayer of Policeman
Kikoy Of Nevada CttjT, is now
on his way to the town in
which he was the author of a
brutal murder a few days ago. Shortly
before 4:.i0 this afternoon Moore was
made to put "n his old clothes and Ret
ready for his trip. Sheriff Getchell
handcuffed the man and also placed a
strap about his body bo that there was
no possibility of his petting away or
doing any one any harm.
As Moore came out of the jail, fol
lowed by his gray-haired old father,
aged 84, the two presented a pitiful
sieht. Moore was very weak and at
every step limped badly. His clothes
were ragged and torn, indicating that
'. he had crawled through lots of brush,
' and his feet were almost on the gmund.
His hands were a mass of slivers and
thorns.
sit riff Getchell will probably try to
fgle his man Into Nevada City in
night, as he fears some violence
he attempted. Sheriff Getchell
accompanied by his Under Sheriff
llbo by Sheriff Veale. The father
ot accompany his son on the jour
ney.
The excitement in town over the ar
rest is groat, and a large crowd fol
a.-.I them into the train, anxious to
cm a glimpse of the man guilty of
shooting down an officer In cold blood.
All day long Moore sat by the stove
in the corridor of the jail, but he had
very little to say to any one. Sheriff
Getchell and Under Sheriff Nihell .if
Nevada City arrived at Port Costa
early this morning and hired a horse
and buggy and drove down to town.
They were taken to the jail and shown
the man arrested.
"Hello, Ed," Paid Getchell to Moore.
The voice was evidently familiar to
Moore, as he rolled over in bed and re
plied: "Hello, Dan."
â How did you come to get down here.
and how long have you been in jail?"
asked Getchell.
Moore replied that he did not know,
and again turned his face to the wall.
Getchell said he was the man wanted,
all right, and that he would take good
care that he did not get away. The
articles that were taken from the pos
session of Moore when arrested were
shown Getchell.
"Is there a gold ring with a hair
setting among them?" asked Nihell.
When it was si own to him he said:
"I am sure that he is the man. I saw
him wearing that ring as long as
twenty years ago."
The gold hunting-case watch, the of
ficers explained, was at 'me time the
property of a woman named Ida Marsh.
This woman lived with Moore in his
cabin for a number of years, and when
she died the watch waÂ« given to him.

MOB OF NEGROES
INVADES A JAIL
Man of Their Own Race
Is Slain.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
KANSAS CITY, April 25.â A special
to the Star from Galena, Kans., says:
Charles William, alias Jones (colored),
was shot to death at 3:30 o'clock this
morning in the city jail by a mob of
negroes. William killed L.aura < "ana
fax, a negress, yesterday.
The mob, composed of about twenty
-1 ' five masked negroes, went to the jail,
I and four men gained an entrance by
; breaking the door in. The first man
had an ax, the second a rope and the
\ third carried a pistol. Williams was
; locked in his cell, but they lost no time
breaking the lock and ordered him to
come out. This he refused to do,
claiming he was innocent of the charge.
Then he grabbed a couple of bricks and
asked them to give him a fair show.
At this the man who. carried the re
volver began shooting through the bars
at Williams. Four shots took effect,
killing the murderer instantly. The
work of the mob was systematically
and coolly done. They came quietly,
did their work and dispersed without
any demonstration.
.The Coroner's inquest to-day held
: that Wiliams came to his death from
} the effects of pistol shots from an un
; known person. No arrests have been
made.
CHECK OUTRAGES BY
EDUCATING NEGROES
PHILADELPHIA, April 25.â Booker
T. Washington, founder and principal
of tho Tuskegee Normal and Industrial
Institute in Alabama, who arrived here
to-day, was questioned regarding the
Georgia lynchings. He s;iid:
"I would like to speak at length
upon these Georgia occurrences and
Others <>t a like nature which have
taken place in recent years, but in
view of my position and hopes in the
interest <>f the Tuskecgec Institute and
the education of our people, I feel con
strained to keep silent and not engage
in any controversy that might react
upon the work to which 1 am now
lending my efforts. I think I can be
of more service t>> the race by giving
my time and strength in helping to lay
the foundation for an education which
will be a permanent cure for such out
rages.
"I do not mind adding," said the
speaker, "that I am opposed t<> mob
violence under all circumstances. Those
guilty of crime should be surely, swift
ly and terribly punished, but by legal
methods. As a rule the men guilty of i
these outrages are ignorant individuals
who have had no opportunity to obtain
an education and moral restraint.
"The solution of our present difficul
ties is to be found in the thorough
mental, religious and industrial educa
tion of both races in the South. It is
an encouraging fact to note that of the
hundreds of colored men who have been
educated in the higher institutions of
the South, not one has been guiity of
the crime of assaulting a woman."

Yields. â¢
SALINAS, April 25.â The whole of Mon
terey County and particularly the Salinas
Valley has been treated to a thorough
soaking, and. that, too, at a time when It
was most essential to the assurance of !
good crops. The last storm over a month ;
ago which was so heavy in this immedi
ate section did not reach the southern
portions of the county, arid as a result
the ground, which was just beginning to
show the growth of grain, was sadly In |
need of moisture. In the last few weeks
hot winds prevailed in that section and
land which was not under irrigation was
being parched. Even the feed was al
| most ruined. This storm, which has been
! heavier in the south than here, will in
| sure good feed in the valley, while up
i in the foothills crops will be the best in
several years, i
In this section the rain was needed only I
to head the grain. The downpour did :
some damage in beating down nigh bar- >
ley. The Spreckels Company, which puts 1
in many thousand's of acres of land to j
beets and has had to irrigate them ex- j
tensively, undoubtedly will with the. pre- j
I cipitation of this storm be enabled to stop j
| its irrigating plants near this city and at
King City.
The precipitation for the storm thus
far in the several localities is: .Salinas,
.80; Chualar, .82; San Lucas, .78; Brad
ley, .60; King City, 1.02; Gonzales, .63;
Monterey, 1 inch; Castroville, 1.10; Pa
jaro, 1.16.
GERMANTOWN, April 25.â The season
in Glenn County lias been a perfect one
for crops. During the present storm .35
of an inch of rain has fallen, making a
total for the season of 11.31 Inches,
! against 5.98 Inches to the same date last
season. The storm continues.
WOODLAND, April 25.â The weather
continues showery, but the precipitation
has so far been very light. There was
quite a hail storm about noon to-day.
I Fruit-growers do not bebeve- any injury
I has been inflicted upon the fruit crop.
| Public Administrator Dealing says the
apricot and early prune crops will be
short in Capay Valley. There will not
' be more than a third of a crop of apri
! cots and about half the usual yield of
1 prunes. The shortage in these varieties
may be attributed to two causes. The
warm weather in January, followed by
the cold snap, caused many blooms to
drop. The second and principal cause
was the dry weather in 1898. The peach
crop will be very fine.
â¢ LOS OLIVOS, April Light shower-;
since Sunday night settled into a soaking
rain to-day, with every indication of con
tinuing through the night. Without this
storm there would have been no grain
worth mentioning In Santa Yncz Valley.
The ground bad completely dried out.
Good crops are how a certainty. ,
HOLLI3TER, April 25. Rain has been
falling Jill day. It registers .65 of .in inch
for the past twenty-four hours. The rain
is timely, and will result in a third in
crease in crops of all. kinds.
BAKERSFIELD, April 25.â The storm
reached here this afternoon and a re
freshing shower fell. It is quite cool now.
Some snow fell in the mountains.
COLUSA, April 25.â 1t commenced rain
ing on Monday morning, continuing at
intervals up to this morning. Many acres
of wheat had nearly begun to curl, but
these light showers have saved it. On
the plains grain is in splendid condition.
Land that has not been considered worth
the taxes is now covered by fine wheat.
The Grand Island country will have an
immense yield. The indications are tnat
Colusa County will have as large a cron
as in 1880. It is estimated that it will
require 2,500,000 sacks for this county
alone. , The rainfall for the season to
date is 10.S0 inches.
SANTA .MARIA, April From one
half to an inch of rain fell- in different
parts of this valley. The weather still
is threatening. The rain is of immense
benefit to growing crops. The first sugar
beet crop ever planted here will be har
vested this year. . .
SONOMA,. April 25.â rain which
commenced falling in this valley on Sun
day continued at Intervals up to noon to
day. The precipitation insures a big
yield of cereals and an abundance of pas
turage for stock. '
MONTEREY, April 25.â Fields and or
chards of this section had begun to feel
the serious effects of six weeks of .dry
: weather, intensified by high Winds, but
the late copious downfall of rain places
fruit and grain crops. beyond the possi
bility of a failure. The precipitation here
was one-half an inch; In Carmel alley,
over two inches for the last twenty-four
h< SACRAMENTO. April Rain began
falling here at 10:30 to-day. While it will
delay strawberry harvesting somewhat,
it will be beneficial to other crops, which
were in need of moisture. The rain was
accompanied by a light fall of hail.
MARTINEZ. April 25.â Rain com
menced falling here this morning and is
still coming down. The crop will be the
largest one in years. Pasturage is first
class.
COLONEL FINIGAN
IS OUT AGAIN
Judge Angellotti Grants Him a Dis
charge From Further Insol
vency Proceedings.
SAN* RAFAEL, April 25.â Colonel Peter
A. Finigan. celebrated in the public print
as "the millionaire pauper of the Hotol
Rafael." strode from Judge Angellotti's
presence this morning with a look of re
lief on his face. The memory of tne sevpn
weeks he once spent in a cell at tho Coun
ty Jail will now seem like a disagreeable
dream for the colonel has flnnfu- been
discharged from Insolvency proceedings.
Insolvency proceedings in the casa of
Finigan have been pending for nearly two
years. His wife, Emily B. Finigan,
brought suit for divorce and was awarded
Hlimnnv by Judge Angellotti pending the
decision of the court, but Finigan said he
had no money to pay, and aa his Honor
differed with 'him in opinion on the fuh
iect he went to Jail. He then applied to
the court to be adjudged an Insolvent
debtor and when this was a thing of the
past secured his liberty on the groun-1
that lie was an Insolvent.
A few months ago Finigan applied for
a discharge from Insolvency r>roc vcilmus,
but an opposition* was nTd by Mrs. Fini
ean and Attorney M. F. Cochrane as tho
assignee of his creditors. The matter was
to have come up for a hearing to-day,
but as only Finigan and his attorney r.p
pi ared he was given the coveted d's
charge.
TRUMAN GETS A WRIT
OF HABEAS CORPUS
LOS ANGELES. April 25.â 0n petition
of I. J. Truman a writ of habeas corpus
was ordered to-day to issue from the
Supreme Court, returnable at San Fran
cisco on May 2. The petitioner shows that
he is imprisoned by order of Judge Car
roll Cook on account of his failure as
Treasurer <>f Snn Francisco to pay $117
fur services alleged to have been per
formed by Joseph P. Stevens as official
reporter in the Superior Court of that
county. Being adjudged guilty of enn
t.mpfof court, he was lined $5 and com
mitted to the custody of the Sheriff un
til the fine Bhotild be paid.
It is alleged the order made by Judge
Cook is invalid on its face, in that it
does not show that Stevens was tem
porarily appointed to take and transcribe
testimony in a criminal case for which
service the credit was made. It is as
serted that the proper proceeding to bring
the matter before the court is by manda
mus and not by -citation for contempt.

DRIVEN OUT BY
RISING WATERS
Special Dispatch to The Call.
OMAHA. Neb., April 25.â The rise of the
Missouri River at this point has resulted
In driving 600 people from their homes
and the nearly total submergence of bot
tom-land territory six miles long and two
miles wide. The water continues to rise
slowly. The conditions to-night summed
up briefly are as follows:
Eighteen inches rise of water on the
bottoms: the Missouri River flowing di
rectly through Florence Lake to Cutoff
Lake and the bottoms; water within four
inches of flowing over Locust street at
Twelfth; Eleventh street, opposite Bur
dett, half broken away and water pour
ing over in a torrent till stopped partially
by desperate attempts at embankments.
Water is in the icehouse of Swift & Co.
and the South Omaha Company and is
doing much damage. All the manufactur
ing plants on the- bottoms are flooded and
the Union Pacific and Terminal Com
pany's tracks cannot be used.
All night a force 'jf men armed with
Winchesters patrolled the dyke on the
north side of East Locust street to pre
vent cutting. This would relieve the
pressure above, but would Jet a torrent
through and destroy tnousands of dollars
of railroad property and throw the river
over into its old channel. The water is
now within about four inches of the top
of this dyke and the pressure is tremen
dous.
Every building on rhe bottoms is flood
ed, the water being naif way up to the
eaves of many houses. The river is fall
ing above Omaha and it is hoped the
worst will be over by to-morrow.
CATHOLICS BURNED
IN A PUBLIC BONFIRE
VANCOUVER, B. C. April 25.â Oriental
advices per Empress of India are that the j
.Europeans in Hongkong are delighted at
Germany's promptitude in taking meas- i
ures to inflict punishment for attacks |
upon German subjects at Ichoufu, in
Southern Shan Tung. An Ichoufu corre- j
spondent says:'
"To the southwest, twenty miles from
us, there have been a number of riots, :
but no one has been punished as yet. A !
Catholic priest, who is just. in from that j
vicinity, says his life has been, saved I
only through the fleetness of his horse.
"Three Catholics have been killed in I
Feihien, about forty miles to the west
of us. Six of them have been killed at i
Shenshan, of whom two were burned to ;
death in a big public bonfire. This is a i
different affair from the one in which a
child was burned, and two had their eyes
put out by a fieldish mob.
DROWNS HIMSELF
IN THE WISHKASH
Special Dispatch to The Call.
TACOMA. April 25.â Richard Zlegler of
San Jose committed suicide by drowning
himself near Aberdeen on Sunday night
under peculiar circumstances. Ziegler
came to Aberdeen last week to visit his
brother, whom he had not seen tor many
years,. On Sunday his brother invited a
number (if friends to his home to meet the
California*!. They speni the afternoon
and evening discussing topics of general
Interest. IÂ«iter in the evening Richard
Ziegier .got np and left the crowd. H.^
was in the best (if health and spirits and
it was supposed he had gone out to get
a breath of fresh air. He did not return.
and in a half-hour his brother Became
alarmed and instituted search for him.
It was feared he hud fallen into the Wish
kash River and been drowned. Arrange
ments were made to drag the river, but
as it was too dark to accomplish much
that night this was postponed until Mon
day morning.
The drawing- of the riser wns in
progress when Ziegler's bods was discov
ered at the boom on the banks af the
river near Wilson Brothers' sawmill. It
was then low tide, enabling tne Bearcbers
to make a thorough search among the
logs. Had the bodj noi been found be
fore the tide came In again it is consid
ered likely all trace of him would have
been lost, as the lops were being moved
out of the boom that day. Ziegler's hat
"Â«v;is found on the bank a short distance
above his body.
Everything indicate? that he had delib
erately walked to the log boom and
jumped in with suicidal intent. No reason
is known for such action and it is be
lieved he must have been temporarily de
mented.
Ziegler was 53 years old and unmarried.
He had lived at San Jose for years.

BRIGADIER GENERAL SMITH-
ALL Californians will feel something of gratifi
cation in the promotion of Colonel Smith of
the First California to the rank of brigadier
general. The California men in the Philippines have
had much of the severesi work of the campaign to do,
and have distinguished themselves for steadiness of
discipline as well as for daring valor on the field of
battle. The promotion of General Smith is of course
a recognition of the service of his gallant regiment,
and to that extent is an honor for the State.
The elevation of the former colonel to the rank of
brigade commander makes room, of course, for the.
advancement of other California officers in the First
Regiment, so that a considerable number of our fel
low citizens at the front will come home with higher
rank than when they went away.
As theÂ«e promotions constitute one of the very few
pleasing features of this dreary war with savages in a
far- off land, they will be received with the more grati
!i. Whatever may be the differences of opinion
i-onoerning the war itself, there will be none to feel
other than a just pride in every evidence given of the
military efficiency and patriotic valor of our boys at
the front.
The Legislature of Massachusetts intends to revoke
an edict under which Roger Williams was banished
from the Massachusetts colony in 1635. It cannot be
possible that the legislators of the New England State
think that Roger wants to come back.
The (';.-: .trhes announce that Li Hung Chang is
going to get his yellow jacket back. After the hot
time he had with the jacket before, it is not altogether
certain that Chang wants it back.

PHILIPPINE COMPETITION.
""TpHE Manufacturers' and Producers' Association
THE taken alarm about Producers' competition
has taken alarm about Philippine competition
* with home industry.
â¢ ; Some American mercantile adventurers in the
it-lands have addressed a large number of Chambers
of Commerce and other commercial bodies in this
country asking their assistance to secure abolition of
tariff on Philippine imports to this country.
This is the appearance of the head of the procession
of difficulties and complications which will draw its
length along many years, as -one of the collateral
curses let loose upon us by the. imperial policy.
The use of cheap and servile labor in the islands and
the admission of its products to compete with white
and free labor in 'the United States means
but one ' thing, and that is the . retirement of
white labor from the competition altogether, or
its decline and degradation to the level of
the servile laborer. The proposition is to garrison ;
and govern these islands at the expense of the Ameri- I
can laborer, and to hold their people down by armed
force while they are exploited and their labor brought
into competition with that which pays for holding '
them in involuntary servitude.
The wants of tropical people are few and are not
capable of increase. Nature imposes no necessities
upon them. Her bounty is ..sufficient for their suste- ;
nance. Our exports to the Philippines will be prin- !
cipally liquors, and not necessaries of life. If cheap
labor can be forced there and its products admitted to
competition here the effects will fall harmfully where ;
they can least be borne.
The farmers of this country seek anxiously for
profitable diversion of their, crops. They have found
it in the production of sugar and tobacco. These ar
ticles differ from other farm crops by "affording exten
sive and well paid employment to labor in their trans
mutation for the market. '
In. other ways and. other articles ruinous com
petition will -appear. But suppose we do not break
down the tariff and admit Philippine products, but
we go to all the heavy public expense necessary â¢ to
force labor there in a production that will go into the
markets of the world, what benefit will come to the
American taxpayer who pays the cost? While he
will not be struck at home by " competition that
drives him out of the field, he will soon discover
that he is being. taxed to support a competitor who
meets and undersells him in the markets of the
world!
Whether the door be open or closed in the Philip
pines, the American taxpayer must pay for keeping it
open or for holding it shut, and his money goes prac
tically to subsidize and pay a bounty to his competi
tor.
England, originally seated on the storm-swept
British isles, with her variety of production limited
by her climate, had some excuse for an expansion
which gave her command of production in every zone.
But we have no such excuse. Our domain covers
the planet from Key West to Point Barrow, from ;
north latitude 22 to 75. We produce tropical, semi
tropical, temperate zone and polar articles of mer
chandise, and out of the vast variety and capacity that
we already possess can supply ourselves and the
world. No wonder the manufacturers and producers i
of California are early in evidence protesting against
sending an army, and navy into ' the East Indian
tropics to force cheap and servile labor into compe- j
tition with us in a field where white labor cannot live.
Brother Jonathan and his continent were able and
ready to master the trade of the world and bring its
profits home for the benefit of white men and white
labor in a climate friendly to them.
We would be glad to have from the Manufacturers'
and Producers' Association a statement of what it is !
expected this country will gain in the Philippines,
with door open or shut, that it cannot gain at home â 
with less cost to the American taxpayer.
If the commerce of the East has needed protection
against cheap labor in Europe, the .commerce of the
West has surely an equal right to protection against
the cheaper labor of Asia. Asiatic labor takes on no
new characteristics by being performed under our
flag and our guns, scourged to its task by the greed j
of the English and German proprietors who own all j
the production of the Philippines that is not in the |
proprietorship of the church orders. It is servile and
involuntary labor still.
THE TRANS-MISSISSIPPI CONGRESS.
AX ofikial call for tiie assembling of the tenth
session of the Trans-Mississippi Commercial
Congress at Wichita has just been issued. The
object of the Congress, as is well known, is to pro
mote the business interests of all the States and Ter
.ritories lying, west of the Mississippi, and it is ex
pected there will be a large attendance.
While the discussions are to be confined to subjects
of common, interest to the section represented at the
congress, they will have, nevertheless, a very wide
scope. Among the questions to be considered are
the irrigation of arid regions, the improvement of
Western rivers, Nicaragua canal, Pacific Coast har
bors, the Gulf outlet, transportation facilities, Pacific
Ocean trade, mining, Western agriculture, national
quarantine aud statehood for the Territories.
In addition to the strictly Western subjects there are
to be discussions on current topics of interest to the
nation as a whole. Among these are the Monroe
doctrine, trusts and combines, our foreign pos
sessions, the election of United States Senators, and
representation at the Paris Exposition and at the
Louisiana purchase exhibition at St. Louis.
The discussions of the congress have the effect of
directing public attention to important Western is
sues, and are helpful in promoting our interests. It
is to be hoped, therefore, that California will be
strongly represented at the Wichita meeting.
WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY.
WHILE to Italy, through the inventor Marconi,
is due the credit of the introduction of a prac
tical system of wireless telegraphy, and while
Great Britain has the honor of having first made an
extensive use of it, there is a strong probability the
United States will be first to take it up on a compre
hensive scale and develop it into widespread utility.
While the British Government after the success, at
tained in the recent tests of the system has seemingly
halted in the work, a number of experiments have
been undertaken by private parties in this country
with a degree of enthusiasm which gives promise of
persistent enterprise in pushing the new invention
into use for every purpose it can be made to serve.
In an interview with the London Chronicle Mar
coni stated that his invention virtually amounts to
two systems of telegraphing without wires. By one
of these systems, that which was tested in Great
Britain, the electric current is diffused through the
atmosphere generally. By that method messages sent
from an altitude of about 200 feet were transmitted
for something like twenty, miles. That system, how
ever, is open to the objection that as the current
travels in every direction, messages sent from any
L point could be taken by a receiving instrument placed
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, APRIL 26, 1899.
anywhere within the radius of the current. It would,
therefore, be easy for messages to be stolen either by
an enemy in war or by other persons.
By the second system Marconi has the electric cur
i rent transmitted not directly, but from what he calls
a reflector. The reflector transmits no electric rays
except those which fall upon it at a certain angle, and
therefore its current instead of being diffused through
the air proceeds in a straight line to the point de
sired. The reflected current, however, is much weak
er than the direct, and up to this time the inventor
has not been able to send messages by that system for
a greater distance than two miles.
The experiments made in the United States have
as yet added nothing of note to the Marconi systems.
The vigor with which they are being prosecuted is,
however, an assurance that it will not be long before
American mechanical ingenuity will devise some
means of making wireless telegraphy of practical u.se I
in the daily affairs of life. We are the most skillful
inventors of mechanical appliances in the world, and
now that science has revealed to us a new method of
using electrical energy, we may be sure our enterprise I
will not rest until we have made that method service
able to the community and profitable to the pro
moters.
UNTIL a short time ago the commission of
murder by poisoned candy or other article of
food sent through the mails was almost un
known to our criminal records. Then came the
Botkin case, which developed into one of the sensa
tions of the time, and since then other cases have
followed one another with a startling rapidity.
Within a time comparatively short we have had
reports of such cases in New York City, in Brooklyn,,
in St. Louis, and now other cases are reported in this
State. Nor is the crime confined to America. â > The
London police are now engaged in trying fo trace
the author of a similar crime there, the victims in that
case being two women who were poisoned by a cake
sent to one of them through the parcels post.
The effect of suggestion' upon minds already in
clined in the direction to which the suggestion tends
is well known to all students of psychology. In fact,
i: has been well known ever since man first began to
study his fellow man and consider how he could in
fluence his action. It is only recently, however, we
have begun to note that the criminal mind is more
subject to the subtle influences of suggestion than the
normal mind, and that the commission of a sensa
tional murder in any locality is very sure to lead to
similar offenses wherever the story of the original
crime is told and talked of.
It is not reasonable to hold that in all cases of
this kind the first crime is the cause of those that
follow. Persons who are prompted by suggestion
into committing murder would in most instances have
committed it without the suggestion, though not in
that particular way. Such crimes as that of poison
by post, however, may, by reason of the easy way in
which it can be done, be the direct cause of murders
that would not otherwise have occurred. Persons
who would be afraid to try a. bolder murder. might be
tempted to send poisoned food through the mails.
The suggestion appeals to cowardice as well as to
malignity.''
Some of the poisonings which have followed the
Botkin case seem to have been the result of insanity
as much as anything else, and were probably com
mitted by persons of weak minds with criminal ten
dencies, but without any especial malice toward the
victim. The London crime is an instance of that
kind, and is one whose mystery may never be solved.
The poisoned cake in that case was sent to an
inmate of an asylum for imbeciles. She had been
there for some time and could not possibly have made
an enemy in the world. Her parents are poor, but
as she was taken care of by the Government and was
not in any way a charge upon them they could have
no reason in the world for desiring to get rid of her.
Moreover, at the Coroner's inquest it was brought
out that the mother and the other immediate rela
tives of the victim could neither read nor write, and
none of them had ever sent her anything for more
than a year. She was, in fact, out of their lives, and
in their .hard struggle with poverty they thought lit
tle about her.
Here, then, seems to be a murder caused wholly by
suggestion. Some half insane person of criminal ten
dencies has been led to poison a poor imbecile
without having the slightest malice against her. It is
a species of "Jack the Ripper" criminal employing
cunning .instead of brutality, and committing murder
through sheer fiendishness.
Dr. Thomas W. Huntington, recently a surgeon
in the service of the Southern Pacific Company,
informed his associates in the State Medical Society
a few days ago that he had amputated the legs of
three men with great success. As Dr. Huntington
seems inclined to swell with pride at his achievement,
he should look at the record of San Francisco elec
tric cars. In the matter of. the amputation of arms
as well as legs they are an unparalleled success.
Governor Gage has issued a new edict. He says
he will not again submit himself to an interview, but I
will dictate what he ' has to say to a stenographer.
While the people of California are concerned less in
what Governor Gage says than in what he does, it is
sincerely to be hoped that he will succeed in finding
a stenographer who wilj be able to translate his Ex
cellency's remarks into English, fortified with an affi
davit of truthfulness.
Â»
And now one of the powerful political organs of
Austria declares that America is no good. Judging
from the way that Uncle Sam has been acting lately,
it would be a wise policy for Austria to mind her own
business and not disturb herself with affairs which do
not concern her.
When Governor Gage went to a secret conference
with William F. Herrin at the Palace Hotel he prob
ably said to himself that he might as well be killed for
a sheep as a lamb.
A veracious correspondent declares that the Span
iards are leaving Cuba. Nobody supposed for a mo
ment that they were going to take it with them. â¢ .
Bryan is in evidence enough, all the world knows,
but it would be necessary to send out a searching
party to find what has become of Sewall and Watson.
' Collis P. Huntington's repeated assertion that he is
not here for his health is more than borne out by his

â¢
Gas Question Is in Such a Tangle the
Supervisors Do Not Know
What Move to
Make.-
According to legal advise taken by
some members of the Board of Super
visors on the widely discussed oucstion
of gas rates, the legal figure which the
San Francisco Gas and Electric Com- j
pany may charge consumers is $1 10 per
thousand cubic feet. This supersedes the
rate of $1 75 which has been charged for
years. The minority members of the
board believe that unless further action
is taken the company must hereafter
render its bills at the reduced rate.
It was given out that a resolution
would be presented at the meeting of the
Board on Monday fixing a rate of $1 50.
For some reason this measure fell by the
wayside, the membqr charged with its
introduction failing to bring it out. It
is understood the majority members of
the board will support a resolution fixing :
the rate at that figure. If they found it
impossible to pass it they might linally
compromise on $1 35, the rate for which
the minority is holding out. The consun- '
sus of opinion' among the members is
that $1 10 is too low and would not stand |
in law. They make bold to differ with
his Honor, the Mayor, in this matter,
claiming the company has not been alto
gether fairly dealt with.
They would like to test the contention
of Mayor Phelan that the rate is irrevoc
ably lixed for one year at $1 10, but do
nut know what steps to take to bring the
matter to an issue. When the members
are satisfied that Mayor Phelan's doc
trine will not stand in law they will, ac
cording to their present ideas, name $1 50
as the legal rate' to be charged. Some
members of the board are advocating ;
that the gas company officials test the ;
matter at once. They could arrange a!
ly suit with some consumer and j
hayÂ« the questioned passed upon judir ;
daily.
The company loses heavily owing to :
the controversy, no matter what action
may be taken. If the rate of $1 00. which j
the company offered to make, be adopted l
its annual re'relpts will be reduced |
000. If 51 50 is determined, upon the re- ;
duction will be $270,000, while if the .re
duction of 40 per cent, already acted up
on by the Supervisor.-, holds good it
means a saving to consumers of JSJ
a year. According to the figures sub
mitted by President Crockett, this would
almost wipe out the profits of the com- i
pany. The small householders and small
storekeepers will prolit by all this slash
ing of rates, as they arein the majority
.â unl bear the major portion of tho bur
d' n for th*' illuminating fluid.
The- officials for the gas company pro
fesa to believe the rate, has not been
fixed at $1 10, but that tho old rate still
obtains and is In force. Their attorneys
are apparently willing to stake their r>p
utations as men skilled in the way of tne
law that no action of the Supervisors has
resulted in fixing a rate which the fias.
company must charge for its product
"The rate for gas is not $1 I<V' said At
torney Thomas B. I.ishop, chief of coun
sel for the company, yesterday. "What
action the directors will take in the mat
ter "f this month's bills I do not know,
as the matter has not as yet been dis

rate and have given no thought to test- !

rate has been fixed and that the old rate ]
is still in force."

OPPOSED TO
CIVIL SERVICE
Editor The Call: In view of the fact
thai The Call is the acknowledged organ
of the people, and speaks for all without
regard to its policy on any of the great
questions of the day, and willing to give
a respectful hearing to all, we most re
spectfully beg leave to request that The
Call give publicity to the following com- j
munlcation in reply to an article in the j
Examiner which it has refused to pub
lish:
The Examiner contains an article in Its
issue of April IS, I^9, under the caption of i
"Under Civil Service Rulesâ Efforts of the !
Amalgamated Society of the Office-seekers
Meet With Small Success." which con
tains these sentences: "That was the
meaning of that strange political freaK
calling itself the Anti-Civil Service j
League, and by other people called the ;
associated office-seekers. Apparently the >
amis have fallen by the wayside, and
their brief activity has borne little fruit."
We desire to correct these misstate
mentSi and believing the Examiner would
not knowingly give publicity to mis- j
statements without affording opportunity
for refutation, the league assures the
public that, it is not composed of the as
sociated office-seekers, or office-holders
either in the mint or elsewhere. We have
not fallen by the wayside, nor has our
brief activity borne little fruit. On the
contrary our activity is undisturbed and
giving great concern to certain interests,
notably the associated office-holders and !
life-service element holding fat jobs under i
Grover Cleveland's so-called civil service!
arder in the United States! Mint and every j
Federal office in the State. Abuse, vitu- !
Deration and opprobrium cannot cause tho
league to fall by the wayside or falter in |
its efforts. We have held many meetings
and are publishing and distributing a
large amount of printed matter, as well
as keeping up a constant correspondence
with the leagues throughout the Union,
and have in Washington a personal rep
resentative, who is giving every attention
to the work mapped out. If the so-called
civil service law was founded on p'rinci- i
pies of justice the old veterans removed
by Daggett, Democratic Mint Superin
tendent, would be reinstated. No; their
jobs are held down by their Democratic
successors because they were Repub- j
Means. We have taken up the matter and j
shortly will take the matter before the
.highest court of- the United States in an
effort to have justice done or unmask the !
hypocrisy of the so-called civil service !
law.
The entire article is misleading', as the
alleged civil service order claimed to be i
promulgated by Gage, Roberts and the
CivH Service Commission has no practical \
effect. The Mint has been operating un- \
dor tho same rule ever since Cleveland's !
order of May 6, IS%, and it is asserted by '
those who seem to know that the em
ployes contribute to the funds of the asso
ciated office-holders' league to foster the
present condition of life service.
The Call will greatly favor the league
and its members by opening its columns
to the foregoing reply to the article to
â which they take exceptions.

E. M. CALVIN-, President.
GUNST AND
UNION LABOR
To the Editor: In the issue of the Ex
aminer of April 4. we notice an article
about M. A. Gunst's anticipated trip, in
â which it is stated that he intends to buy
tobacco plantations in Cuba, in order to
obtain the raw material for cigar manu
facturing purposes only. His mission is
to complete the details of a gigantic deal, !
which, when affected, will place the firm
of M. A. Gunst & Co. at the head of ona
of the largest tobacco syndicates in the
United States.
Mr. Gunst is also reported as saying:
"We will open leading retail cigar stoics
in the cities of San Francisco. Chicag-j,
St. Louis, New York and Boston."
We are positive of his failure in Bos.
ton, as that is strictly a home industrial
city. Now of what benefit win this great
enterprise be to San Francisco or the
State of California? As Mr. Gunst is one
of our most prominent business men and
a city official, we would like to ask him
a few questions. Why will he not start
one of his factories m San Francisco to
manufacture cigars for home consump
tion? He states that he is. purchasing to
bacco plantations in Cuba. Can It be that
he fears that the tobacco would spoil on
its transit to San Francisco? We can
positively assure him that tobacco im
proves with age. Is it possible that he
thinks we have not the skilled mechanics
here to make the cigars'.'
The International Cigar-makers' Union
of America, of which our local union is a
branch, is composed of the best skilled
mechanics in the trade. In 1888 it paid
the railroad fares of 800 first-class Eastern
cigar-makers to San Francisco, and would
have furnished the means of transporta
tion for more had they been needed here.
We therefore claim that Mr. Gunst favors
other localities for the reason that he can
there obtain tenement-house cheap labor,
Where father, mother and children slave
day and nighi for a bar.c livelihood. We
can assure Mr. Gunst that if he contem
plates the employment of free American
labor in the cities in which he proposes
to establish his factories we can serve
him equally as well at home in the manu
facturing of these cigars. We would fur
ther ask him if California is not the best
adapted locality in the United States for
cigar-making on account oi' its climatic
advantages. The Cigar-makers' Inter
national Union stands ready to deposit a
reasonable sum of money in any bank
designated by Mr. Gunst to secure him
ncainst pecuniary loss should it fail to
furnish him with as skilled mechanics in
San Francisco as he can find in either
New York or KÂ«'y West. We cordially
invite Mr. Gunst's reply to these ques
tions inside of a reasonable time. Re
spectfully, J. WOLF. President,
PHIL DAVIS. Secretary.

INK STAINS-Subscriber, City. It is
said that oxymuriatic acid removes per

all acids will remove spots of ink from
paper, but it is important to use oniy
such as do not attack its texture. Spirits
of salt (muriatic acid), diluted in five or
six times the quantity of water, may be
appli ed with success upon the spot a
minute or two after washing it with clean
water. "A solution of oxalic acid, citric
acid and tartaric acid is attended with
the least risk," says one who declares
he has used it, "and may be applied to
paper and printed plates -without fear of
damage. These acids, taking out writing
ink and not touching the printing, can
be used for restoring books where the
margins have been written upon with
out attacking the text." There are. sev
eral preparations for the purpose to be
obtained from -.stationers.

BIG DIFFERENCE IN PRICES
PROTEST OF. THE FIBM CONSID
ERED TRIVIAL.
George H. Fuller Desk Company In
timates Its Intention to Decline
to Go on With the
Work.
Tf the Board of Supervisors approves
the action taken yesterday by the Com
on Public Buildings, and tf no
trouble la made by the i ontractors, the
work of furnishing and completing the
Hall of Justin- for occupancy will be be
kuii at once and pushed to an early com
pletion.
However desirable such a result might
be the immediate prospect of its attain
ment is small on account of the apparent
reluctance of the firm t.> which the prin
cipal contract is to bi awarded to fulfill
Its obligations. The bids for furnishing
the Hall cf Jum nted to the
Board of Supervisors on April 17 and
were to have been opened on that date.
This formality was, however, delayed un
til last Monday, when the bids were
opened and referred io the Committee on
Public Buildings. In the meantime one of
the bidders, the George H. Fuller Desk
Company, filed a written protest and
asked for the withdrawal of their bid <-> n
the ground that a meinb'er of the board
bad declared that he was of the belief
that there was to be a "rake-off" and
that he would defeat the proposition of
letting the contracts. The protest was
Idered trivial and was not allowed.
When the bids were opened it trans
pired that the bid of the George H. Fuller
Desk Company for supplying furniture,
photographic appliances and kitchen fur
niture was $6014 lower than the next high
est bid for the same work. A representa
tive of the company appeared before the
Committee on Public Buildings yesterday
and declared that his firm did not want
the contract and renewed the protest pre
viously made to the board. He even in
timated that if the board insisted en
awarding the contract to the firm as the
lowest bidder the matter would be taken
into the courts.
The implied threat had no effect and
the committee voted to recommend that
the contract be awarded to the reluctant
firm. The amount of the bid is $46,486,
and there is in the hands of the clerk of
the Board of Supervisors a certified check
for $5080 from the firm to insure its-per
formance of the contract. The other con
tracts for providing furnishings for the
building were awarded to the lowest bid
ders as follows:
For gas and electric fixtures, San Fran
cisco Novelty and Plating Works, $16,950;
water filter system, ' 'alifornia Artistic
arid Metal Wire Company, $2450; electrical
apparatus, switchboard and telephone
m, Webro-Hendy Company. $3235;

In the matter of the bids for doing the
plumbing work in the new police station
building at Seventeenth and Mission
Htreets the committee agreed to allow
John J. McGcrtvan to withdraw his bid
upon a showing that he had made a mis
take in his figures and had asked leave
to withdraw the bid within the statutory
time. The contract was let to the next
lowest bidders. Allen it Looney, for $1,675.

Distant peals of thunder, weather cool

racing at Oakland yesterua'-. The course
was already muddy, and the heavy down
pour of sleet and rain made It of the

In the thermometer, and live of the six
favorites failed to navigate through the
slop in safety. However, Cavallo, New
Moon and llorton were not overlooked by
the crowd, and the books prorited but lit

The first num decided, a six-furlong
sprint, saw Amasa and Aluminum close
equal favorites in the betting. Many tig
ured the pair would race their heads off
the first part, and backed the third choice,
Cavallo. Aluminum broke first; but was
quickly headed by Amasa The latter led

Hahn on Cavallo got up, winning by a
head.

I had been troubled with tetter for several
years. At times my hands would be sore all over,
co that 1 could not use them at all, and were so
tender that clear water, even, smarted like fire,
and it spread over arms, neck, and face. I had
been treated by physicians, but without benefit,
when I began the Cuticcra remedies, /found
relief before I had taken the first bottle. I used
three or four bottles of Cuticura Resolvent,
one cake of Cuticura Soap, and one box of
Cuticcra (ointment), and it has never troubled
me since. ELLA CL'KZON,
March 10, 1898. Eppinghom, 111.
BLOOD POISON CURED

One of ray children ran a rusty nail into his
foot, vrhlch was most painful. Bis blood got
out of order, and sores broke out on his hands

Soap, principally a* a salve, and the child re-
covered. Mrs. J. 8. FUKEN,

"SOAPY SMITH" WILL
BE THE LADIES' PET
A FREAK FOR THE DOG SHOW.
SOAPY SMITH, a dog owned by A. Carrillo of this city, will without doubt
be the greatest curiosity of any dog that will be exhibited in the com
ing dog show. Soapy is a recent arrival from the Klondike region; in
fact, he only arrived from the frozen north two weeks ago, and was sent
down by express to Carrillo by a friend as a present. The owner says that
he dors i:i. t want any more canine presents, as he had to pay $125 express on
the animal. The most curious thing about the dog is that he is half bear and
half dog. His father was a big brown bear and his mother a genuine Klon
dike dog. Soapy has inherited his father's nn<> fur coat, the nair on his back
being several inches long. He also walks with the clumsy gait of a young
cub. "nut he is quite docile and tame. How he will stand the warm weather
1. but the hot spell of last week was very hard on the
animal. If the temperature should be warm for Soapy out at the show his
owner claims he will treat him to cold storage treatment by placing a big
cake of Ice in his kennel. Several Klondike miners who have seen the dog
claim that the animal is a splendid specimen of his species and that this breed
of animals, though only recently attempted in the north, has proved a great
success and that ior hard work drawing sleighs they have more endurance
and patience than any other breed.

McKELVEY WAS
NOT ON THE
MARY GARRET
Mourned as Among
the Dead.
A DISAPPEARANCE EXPLAINED
WENT TO THE KOOTENAI AND
NOT THE KLONDIKE.
A Wealthy Oakland Mining Oper
ator Given Up as Lost Returns
to His Friends and Busi
ness Associates.
After beinp mourned as dead for nearly
it John McKelvey, the wealthy Oak
land mining man, has come back among
his friends and business associates on
this and the other side of the bay, and is
l" Ing kept busy explaining his mysteri
ous disappearance of eleven months ago.
Through all these months McKelvey has
been remembered as one of those who
went down on the ill-fated Mary Carret,
the Klondike boat that turned turtle and
sunk With nearly an on board last May
when on her way to St. Michael. His sud
den reappearance has brought joy to a
host of friends he has made since his res-
Idence in California in this city and Oak
land.
McKelvey came to this country from
Mexico some live or six years a^o, and
since that time has been heavily inter
ested in mining properties on both the
northern and southern sections of the
mother lode, and a number of them he
has had under successful operation, lie
had the inborn shrewdness of the canny
Scott, and his success in his mining ven
tures made him many influential busi
n< ss associates.
When the Klondike fever was at its
height he bought interests in four of the
best claims in that district and started a
couple of experienced miners on their way
there to manage his new properties. They
took passage on the schooner Mary
Garret
He made, his plans known to few of his
friends, but those who were informed
understood that he was to take passage
on the same vessel. At the time she
Bailed he also disappeared, and when the
Dews earn.' back from the Alaskan coast
that, with others of her class, the Mary
Garrett had sunk with nearly all on
board McKelvey was given up as one
among the lost. Then came the list of
drowned, and the name "John McKelvey"
appeared among them, and it was an
nounced that the only ones saved were
a minister and his wife. The minister has
since been confined in a madhouse as. a
result of his awful experience.
McKelvey's name 'appearing among the
list of lost settled his fate in the minds
of his friends, and they were about ready
to set about arranging his estate when
he came back to arrange It himself. He
got back on Wednesday last, and his
surprise was great at learning his obit
uary had been already written.
He had simply started off on one of his
periodical prospecting trips, and it had
taken him into the Kootenal district of
British Columbia. He had not thought It
worth while to announce his trip, and
following his usual custom he had started
off after saying nothing.
It has developed since that there was a
John McKelvey on the passenger list of
the lost Mary Garrett and that he lost
his life with others who went down with
her, but he was not the McKelvey who
was mourned for so long a time, and all
the search possible has failed to find any
one to mourn for him. No trace has betn
found of his relatives or acquaintances,
and so far as the history of that ill
advised rush is concerned he will be
known as simply one of the many who
gave up their lives to it.
The right John McKelvey has returned
to life, and back from the Kootenai he
has brought the title deeds to some of
the best promising properties of that dis
trict, and just now he is busy receiving
warm congratulations, by telephone and
otherwi.se, from his friends.

Moving the Fence.
The sign fence, a nuisance which sur
rounds the ruins of the Baldwin Hotel,
and which has for months past been an
obstruction to pedestrians, is to be re
moved. By a special permit from the
Board of Supervisors "Lucky" Baldwin
was allowed to erect the fence, and when
he did so extended it so far out from the
walls on the . Market and Ellis street
sides as to take up more than half of the
pavement. In the case of the Market
street side this has been a great annoy
ance, as it left a very narrow passage
way.
At the meeting of the Street Commlt
tee on Monday night positive orders were
given to have the fence moved back to
the line of the building. Yesterday Bald
win, in compliance with the order, set a
gang of men to work to move the fence
back. The work will be accomplished
this week, much to the convenience of
all pedestrians and the joy of the shop
keepers in the neighborhood, to whom it
has been a great inconvenience.
BATTLE OF BUNKER HILL.
Its Anniversary Will Be Fittingly
Cele orated in This City.
The anniversary of the Battle of Bunker
Hill will be celebrated In an elaborate
fashion by patriotic societies of this city
on June 17. For the past forty years the
day has been fittingly recalled in San
Francisco by speech and song, but this ]
year it is proposed to make the details
of the celebration more extensive and to
excel all past commemorations of Its
character. The Sons of the American
Revolution jvill unite with the Califor- |
nia Pioneers and the Bunker Hill Asso- \
ciation, and they will invite the partici- i
pation of public men in exercises which
will be arranged to-night.
At Sunset Park, in the Santa Cruz
Mountains, an appropriate programme
will be listened to, and two trainsâ one
at 7:45 a. m. and the other at 8:50â will
leave the foot of Market street for the
grounds. Two bands will accompany the
excursionists.
This evening a meeting of the three so
cieties will be held at the Occidental Ho
tel to arrange a programme. It has been
proposed to request the Secretary of War
to fire a salute from all the forts in the
harbor, and Mayor Phelan will be invited
to t.V-p a prominent part in the pro
gramme. The Governor v.-ill be asked to
declare the 17th day of June a legal holi
day, whereby business may be suspended.
MINERAL LANDS.
Judge Morrow Renders an Important
Decision as to the Duty of Govern
ment to Prove Certain Facts.
United States Circuit Judge Morrow de
cided Monday that when the Govern
ment brings suit to cancel a land grant
under the plea that the land is more val
uable for its mineral deposits than for Its
agricultural products, the Government
must prove the plea.
The case was that of the T T nited States
against the Central Pacific Railroad Com
pany, George W. Towle, Allen Towle, Ed
win Towle and others to cancel a grant
by the United States to the Railroad Com
pany of a section of timber land in Ne
vada County. It appeared from the evi
dence that some mining had been done on
the land before thr- Government granted it
to the railroad company, but that the !
mining had been discontinued, and after
the Towles bought the section from the
railroad they cut a large quantity of val
uable timber off the tract.
The Government failed to prove that th*e
land was more valuable for its mineral
deposits than for its timber, etc., hence
it lost the case.
Two Girl Pickpockets.
Two young grirls. who from their ap
pearance have resided on the ragged side
of life for some time, in name Bessie
Bond and Gertrude Heigrhtler, were con
victed yesterday by a jury in Judge
Cook's court of the crime of grand lar
ceny for having relieved Henry Hock of
a purse containing $G5. After the judg
ment of the jury had been rendered
Judpe Cook asked the young women
their aces. nry.l both confessed that they
were pp.st IS years. This means that they
must Â£o to State Prison, notwithstanding
that they were recommended to the mercy
of the court by the jury. In the same
court John Wilson was convicted of bur
glary in the second degree. He stole an
overcoat from a supst in the Wenban
Hotel, on Sutter street.
ADVERTISEMENTS.
Rupture Was Cured
Five Years Ago the Experiment
Was Tried.
No Doubt But What the Cure Is
Permanent.
In the early part of ISM, J. D. Thompson of
Castorland, N. V., was attracted by the news-
paper announcement that Dr. \V. S. Rice of 41S
T. Main street, Adams, N. V., had perfected
i
MR. J. D. THOMPSON.
a new and marvelous cure for rupture. Mr.
Thompson had a rupture that the various
kinds of trusses on the market wouldn't hold.
â o he communicated with Dr. Rice and began
treatment Immediately. He was cured so com-
pletely as to upset all former theories regard-
ing? the treatment of rupture and for the past
five years has been as sound as a dollar. This
fact is worthy of publication, since there are
thousands of sufferfrs who honestly believe
they cannot be cured. Write to Dr. Rice and
he will send you free a book that describes
this grand treatment.
It is a home cure at small cost, painless,
harmless, without operation or loss of an hour
from work. It cures man, woman or child,
and no matter how bad the rupture may be
the cure is quick, complete and permanent.

GAGE'S EYE IS ON
INSANE ASYLUMS
The Governor and the Mexican Preparing to
Fulfill a Senatorial Fight Contract.
California Insanity Law Neatly Amended for the Purpose, the
Personnel of Two Boards Will Be Adjusted, Heads
Will Fall and Obligations Be Paid,
A POST MORTEM examination of
the late Senatorial contest, held at
Sacramento and with Incidental off
shoots elsewhere, is at present go
ins- on and is not barren of results, like
wise odor. During the heat of battle
l>ani.-.l M. Eurns ofttimes stimulated the
waning enthusiasm of his adherents with
a story of c'tard up his sleeve which he
would sprlns at the opportune moment.
This card was accepted as half a hun
dred votes by his faithful rabble, but
when the opportunte moment came they
found that the card was just forty-nine
votes beneath their expectations, con
sisting solely and alone of the eminent
Dr. Marvin, Assemblyman, of Huml
] >r. Marvin's vote went to the Mexican
Bt the last ballot. Every Journalist and
politician in Sacramento knew that Mar
vin's vote belonged to Burns, and the
reason that it was not given him before
the closing hour supports a story, as yet
untold. 'he truth is that Dr. Marvin has
long been reaching out for the medical
suporintendency of the State Asylum
for the Insane, at Napa. This position.
It was generally known by the press, was
promised him by the Governor and his
patronage distributor. Daniel M. Burns.
Knowing thai the press was aware of
the promise made him, Marvin was fear
*f::l that an open tight for Burns, bacned
by his ballot cast at each call, would re
eult in an expose, so he held ii In re
serve, ready though to turn It over at
the signal from his master. Burns never
gained sufficiently, however, to warrant
dragging the Humboldt physician states
man into the open battle, but at th last
opportunity the order went out, and Mar
vin, obedient to the call, cast his vote for
Daniel M.
While Marvin thus stood ready to as
sist Hums there was creeping through
thrt Legislature an amendment to an act
through which the physician was to be
rewarded. This amendment was known
as an act to amend certain sections of
the California insanity law. The amend
ni'iit through which Marvin is, so he
was promised, to realize his ambition,
amounts to the insertion of four words
in section ?< of article 2 of the insanity
law; but it will result in a radical change
of the personnel of the Boards of M.m
agers of both Xapa and Agnews Asy
lums. As originally approved March 3>,
jV-7. the amended section reads:
','The managers, and their successors
appointed after the appointment and
classification made pursuant to the pre
ceding section, shall severally be ap
pointed by the Governor as ofton as a
vacancy fhall occur, or otherwise; and
they may severally continue in office un
til " their successors art appointed and
qualify, and thoy shall be subject to re
moval" by the Governor up^>n cause shown
and an Opportunity to be heard. No per
son shall be eligible to the office of man
ager who is either an elective State of
ficer or a member of the Legislature, and
If any such manager shall become a mem
ber of the Legislature or an elective State
officer, his office as manager shall be va
BOSS BUCKLEY
SADDLES UP AND
TOOTS HIS HORN
Openly Says He Is in
Politics.
A Fomfwhat startling development in
what promises to be a hot campaign full I
of surprises comes early in the shape of a j
bold announcement by Christopher A. j
Buckley to his followers that he is now j
openly in politics again, and that on Mon- j
day next "Democratic headquarters" will
be opened in the Baldwin Annex, now be
ins remodeled and repaired.
On Monday two nicely furnished suites
of rooms in the now fenced and blackened
Baldwin Annex will be open under the
(â upfrintendence of Alex Greg-gains, one j
of the "old guard" that has been loyal
through all thÂ»-se years of Buckley adver-
Fity. Mr. Buckley is supposed to pay the :
bill?. The play, as indicated above, is to |
be that these are "Democratic headquar
ters, '' and a glad hand is to be kept
vibrating through a hole by the open door ]
day and night. "All Democrats" will be j
welcomed; even and possibly especially,
memoers of the Committee of One Hun
dred.
ThÂ« Democratic Central Glub will soon

Its rapidly growing membership has now
reached nearly 2<jOO. It is going to have a

ing. â¢
City and County Attorney Franklin K.
Lane is to be the chief speaker, and his
eubject will be "The Primary Law."
"Hon. Harry Mulcreavy" and other Jef
fÂ«>rsonians are announced to speak before
und after the refreshments. After Mr.
Lane gets through a very important
resolution is to be introduced, with the
present supposition that it will be car
ried. This resolution will declare that
convention delegates should be nominated
by districts only, and it will vigorously
denounce any scheme to put up an "at
large" ticket for municipal convention
delegates, in whole or in part. The pro
pramrae then Involves administering a
vigorous kick at the leaders of the Com
mittee of One Hundred, who, as announced
in The Call, are scheming to beat the pri
mary law by such a ticket, which would
rob many districts of their proper repre
sentation.
Chairman Beth Mann has not yet for
mally called the meeting of the execu
tive committtee to consider the Heeney
appeal, but said yesterday that it would
be held within a few davit and that the
appeal, which involves the existence of
the Committee of One Hundred, was the
only reason for the meeting. Mr. Mann
thinks that his decision to call the meet
ing for Â»nis vital purpose baa been mis
understood, and in discussing the mat
ter yesterday aid, briefly:
"ThÂ« â  â  seems to be a mistaken idea that
my calling the meeting is for the purpose,
on my part, of disturbing the Committee
of One Hundred. The fact is that the ex
ecutive committee postponed consideration
of tho appeal 'until after the Legislature
adjourns.' The Legislature has adjourned,
and in calling the committee together to
consider the appeal 1 am but performing
a mere ministerial duty, to which I am
bound in pursuance of the orders of th.Â«
committee. If I should fail to call the
committee together for this purpose it
might be charged that I had some ulterior
purpose and was in alliance with some
faction. I do not know what the com
inlUee will do with the appeal, of course.
1 disclaim any leaning to any faction, and
believe that factions should disappear at
the time of this Democratic opportunity.
and that a few Democrats should not get
together and refuse to recognize the rest
of the party as Democrats.
cant. If any manager fails for three
â  months to attend the regular meetings of
the board of which he is a member, un
less he be ill or Bent from the State,
I hts office shall be vacant, and the board,
by resolution, shall so declare, and a cer
tified copy of every such resolution shall
forthwith" be transmitted to the Gover
nor."
This act has been so amended that fol
lowing "No person shall be eligible to the
office of manager who is either an elec
tive" the words "or appointive" State of
ficer have been inserted, the same change
being made in reference to subsequent
coming Into a State office.
With this little change made in the law
Gage Is now ready to keep his contract
with Marvin. Frank L. Gould of Stock
; ton, a well-known and influential politi
cian, is slated to part from the board
of managers of Agnews. Gould is on the
Building and Loan Association commis
sion, being an appointive State officer.
With the dropping out of Gould, General
Barrett of Napa, present Bank Commis
sioner and member of the board of man
agers of Napa Insane Asylum, will step
; from the last named office. A Republican
will be appointed to till the vacancy and
then trouble will commence. Three Re
, publicans, or a majority of the boards of
both Napa and Agnews asylums, will
i then be in full power. Under the old law
j II was necessary that a four-fifths vote
I be cast against a resident physician be
fore he could be removed. With com
mendable foresight, this little matter has
1 been fixed up in the amendment so the
j section governing the removal of resident
asylum officers reads "Any medical su
perintendent or treasurer may be re
moved by a majority vote of the board of
; managers for cause." Doubtless cause
will be found and then the ax.
For some time trouble has been brew
\ ing around Dr. Gardner, present medical
I superintendent of Napa Insane Asylum,
and it seems that politics have so shaped
matters, or, rather. Burns has so shaped
politics, that he must go. Dr. Henni
of Napa. who is known as Gage's politi
cal adviser as to matters arising in the
fertile valley surrounding- his home, has
long been antagonistic to Dr. Gardner.
This makes matters i-ven more smiling
for Marvin, as it is being circulated
throughout the land that Hennessy will
us.' all his power to remove Gardner from
his present position. With Gardner out
and Marvin in as medical superintendent
the next move, it is said, will be to make
Dr. Stone of Marysville first assistant
superintendent.
These changes made attention will be
turned to Agnews. where Dr. Sponogle, a
Budd appointee, at present holds the up
per hand. With the change in the board
as stated Sponogle, it is said, will be re
lieved from office and Dr. Stocking, at
present first assistant medical superinten
dent of the asylum, will be .appointed to
fill the vacancy.
Th- amendment to the insanity law was
introduced by Mr. Raub. but Mr. Raub
is not accused of suggesting its introduc
tion. It shows the hand of Gage, and
through the hand the shadow of Burns.
It was an effort made on behalf of a
faithful ally; its purpose was not appar
ent to the legislators and it went through
and through it rewards will be distrib
uted.
MEXICAN DAN'S
SPURS JINGLE
IN HIS WRATH
Devoto and Dr. Lawlor
in Disfavor.
Colonel Dan Burns of Mexico, celebrated
from Cow Hollow to MSlpitas as one deep
ly learned In the political lore of the
i and other wiles, dealing more spe- l
cifically with the Senatorial problem, is
.i-T.v man. Verily the colonel is aid
ing the bucking broncho of wrath and fiery
I ation, and the jingle of his spurs
iror into the bosoms of his
henchmen.
Ie things the governor of Governor
Gage desired to keep quiet have leaked
out and others are in danger of leaking.
Burns intends to make an example of a
i few of the incautious "faithful" by verbal
vitriol used without stint, and the sur
! face of their understanding is already
I in a most scientific manner. Louis
roto and Dr. Lawlor, the prison phy
sician at San Quentin, are trembling !n !
, their shoes as a result and showing their '
\ penitence in every possible way. Their ;
ftats of tongue have caused all the uproar
in the camp of the Mexican gentleman
a re sorry.
Devoto was one of Burns' stanchest
rtera at Sacramento, and wh<
Legislature adjourned he was promised
. isition of Chief Food Inspector now i
hÂ«-icl by James A. Dockery. On account
of the fact that Dockery has made so ef
ficient .1 public servant it was deemed de-
Birable to keep quiet the intention, to
place Devoto in the position as long an
possibU â to delay the storm until ft was
too late for the other aspirants for politi
cal plums to make any mischief by their
protests. But in his pride and Joy over
the welcome news Devoto imparted it to
a '"close friend" as a secret. The friend
also made somebody a confidant, and as
usual, the news got to The Call before an
organ of the "boss" had aji inkling of
what was going on.
Now Burns is tainting the atmosphere
with a thicker cloud of cigar smoke than
ever, increasing the aroma with a lot of
choice expletives and threats of what De
voto may expect wh.-n he sees him in
person. The latu-r has sent all kinds of
excuses to his chief, but so far has re
d the cold ear of silence.
Dr. Lawlor was to be made Health
Officer. Why. nobody seems to know,
unless it be that the physician was born to
ufnVo. He has held one fo long that his
ripht poems to be unquestioned. He also
tainted numerous friends with his
; good luck, and the apple is fast turning
to a Btone in his mouth. In fact, Lawlor
is mortally afraid that he "is done for "
But both Devoto and Lawlor have quit
their feats of tongue.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, APRIL 20, 1899.
HE CUT HIS THROAT
UNDER A FLATCAR
HASKEL CANTROWITZ, the 20-year-old son of Heyman Cantrowitz of
514 Fuiton street, was found dead yesterday morning under a flatcar on
a sidetrack near the Southern Pacific railroad station at Colma, San
Mateo County, his throat cut from ear to ear. A bloody razor
clenched in a death grip in the right hand warranted the presumption that the
young man taken his own life. The body was found at 5 o'clock in the morn
a resident of Colma named Charles Sundima.n, who was walking along
the track, lie notified Deputy Coroner Cunningham at Baden. At an inquest
held later the jury returned a verdict of suicide. The remains were taken to
od City.
The identity of the suicide was established from a letter on his person, and
the members of his family in this city were notifl* d of tho fate that had over
taken him. They were at a loss to account for his act. one of them saying
that there was no known reason for it, as he had everything he desired. It is
ible, however, that the mind of the young man, who was a sufferer from
erysipelas and extremely sensitive, had become unbalanced from inability to
bis position. He was <riven a place Monday a week ago in the receiving
department of Weinstock, Lubin & Co., with the promise, if he proved capa
ble, of a permanent position. He had been employed by the firm in another
department during the busy holidays and at several other dry goods stores in
the city, and had given satisfaction. He did not appear, however, to be able
to fulfill the requirements of his new position and he was discharged last Sat
urday night. Monday morning he left his home and that is the last his family
saw or hoard of him until informed of his suicide.
U. S. GRANT IS
NOT DISTURBED
BY IDLE RUMOR
The San Diego States
man Is in Town.
Governor Gage has announced that he
Will appoint the three Paris Exposition
Commissioners as Boon as he returns to
Sacramento from the San Pedro Harbor
Jubilee. According to the story wired
to' this city the Commissioner from
Southern California will be a Grand
Army man. The inference is drawn there
fore that Major Ben C. Truman will be
appointed. lit- is a Grand Army com
rade who served under General George
H. Thomas with the Army of the Cum
berland. It is not called to mind that
there is any other aspirant of the order
In the field for this particular place,
hence the conclusion is strengthened that
-Major Ben will get the job.
At last accounts the major enjoyed the
friendship of Collls P. Huntingdon. When
other magnates of the Southern Pacific
consented to the scheme to oust the ma
jor from the literary department of the
company Huntingdon remained . loyal to
his old friend and carried his loyalty to
the extent of protesting against the sac
rifice of Truman. The late A. N. Towne
was another stanch admirer of the major
and never conceded that any one on this
side of the continent possessed a literary
style which surpassed that which the
major exhibited in the early numbers of
Del Monte Wave. When the Southern
Pacific threw down the major the Santa
Fe took him up and most likely the pro
gressive corporation has used Its Influ
ence in his behalf.
The story published a few days ago
that the Governor had appointed D. M.
Burns to be United States Senator from
California is not verified by the facts, as
no appointment has been made and none
will be made until the Senate renders a
decision in the Quay case. No doubt
the Governor will appoint Burns if he
finds that an appointee will be Heated.
The same railroad influence that was in
voked to procure the election of Burns
is doubtless employed to bring about his
appointment, but Gage will do nothing
but promise until the Senate acts on
Quays commission.
U. S. Grant arrived in the city from
San Diego yesterday morning and regis-
red at the Palace Hotel. During the
day he saw several of his leading sup
porters in the recent Senatorial campaign
at Sacramento. Grant is not at all dis
turbed by the rumor that Gage intends
to appoint Burns to fill tTie vacancy In
the Senate. He is not a candidate him
self for the honor of appointment by tne
Governor, and if he were then; is no cer
tainty that Gage would appoint him.
Nothing disturbs Mr. Grant. He is likely
to attain distinction in California as the
I great undisturbed. He will remain in
an Francisco for several days

One of the most important features
scheduled for the meeting of the Board i

the appointment of a lieutenant to suc

reduced to a sergeant. There are only
two prominent candidates for the position.
Sergeant Christensen and Sergeant John

The friends of both these men hava left
no stone unturned to advance the intoi

McKINLEY'S COAST VISIT.
Pressure of Official Business May-
Prevent the President's West
ern Tour.
President McKinley may not be able
after all to visit the Pacific Coast this
year. Some time ago it was announced
that the President was preparing to make
a tour of Inspection of the coast and to
visit most of the Important Western cit
ies. The authorities of several towns in
the State were outlining plans for a grand
reception, and it was accepted as a prac
tical certainty that the President would
come. It appears now, however, that the
President may not be able, owing to the
pressure of public business, to leave
Washington.
This information was received yester
day by a gentleman who had communi
cated with President McKinley to learn
his plans and his wishes. The letter was
answered by the assistant secretary- of
the President, and in part was as fol
lows:
"It is still quite uncertain whether the
pressure of public business will permit
the President to visit the Pacific Coast
this year, and as yet no plans whatever
have been made for such a trip."
This official announcement from the
household of the President himself settles
all further question In reference to the
matter. San Franciscans may not have
the pleasure of seeing the chief executive
this year.

CRIMMINS OUT
FOR DIRECTOR
HEAD'S SCALP
Would Deprive Him of All His
Chairmanships.
To-Night's Meeting Will Very Likely Change the
Old Balance of Power in the Board
of Education.
FROM the headquarters of Mr. Phillip
Crlrnmins the ukase has gone forth,
and unless publicity fihall change or
postpone for a time the plans of the
Board of Education, Director Edward
Head will to-night be shorn of the chair
manship of the Supplies Committee and
will be cut down from the same office on
the Evening Schools Committee.
Mr. Head, it is said, is to be relieved
for cause. The charges against him are
incorporated in a repor.t which is due to
be presented at the meeting of the board
this evening and which have been in
preparation for the past fortnight. The
Crimmins six on the board claim that
the decent element, frequently mentioned
as the "Club Five," will vote with them
for Mr. Head's dethronement.
The report will set forth that Head is
relieved of his executive prerogatives
because he has found not enough time
to properly administer the affairs of ftis
offices. The Supplies Committee is one
of the most important in the city's plan
of schools. To it come all the requisi
tions of the different principals for the
supplies necessary to their different
charges, and the chairman's days are
full in attending to them.
Mr. Head's duties as an employe of the
Spring Valley Water Company, so it is
paid, do not leave him sufficient time for
Supply Committee matters. The Evening
School Committee is of almost equal im
portance, and Mr. Head's Spring Valley
duties have apparently left him little
time for that, either, for the fact remains
that in the four months of his incum
bency he has rendered but one report]
and that upon evening school matters.
These art- the things, it is said, that
are to be charged against Mr. Head. At
any rate they will appear upon the re
port when that shall be rendered, and in
throwing him out of his position his fel
low members will find their excuse in
them.
It appears that Head's undoing is his
own, and it began when the present
board was organized last December. At
that time ho started to make the worst
of his splendid opportunities. The first
nlan of organization was promulgated by
Mr. Stow and it gave to the clean ele
ment on the board control of adminis
trative matters. Besides Mr. Stow as
president, Mr. Eels (D. ) was to be chair
man of the Classification Committee and
Mi Stow's best man In all board poll
tics. Stafford was to be chairman of the
Supplies Committee, Brandenstein of the
Committee on Rules and Holbrook was to
have the desk job on the Finance Com
mittee.
Mr. Stow's slate was made public on
an ill-chosen day and the Crimmins faction
had ample time to work up a scheme to
beat it. It chose Bcrgerot as its presi
dent and Armstrong. Kemp, Cole and
Gedge for the chairmanships. In neither
one of these schedules was Head consid
ered, and between the two he was left

RENEWS HER FIGHT
HER FIRST APPLICATION IS

Fair Will Executors Object to a
Complaint in Intervention
Being Filed by the
Claimant.
Mrs. Nettle R. Craven opened her fight
yesterday before Judge Troutt for the
widow's share of the estate of the late
James G. Fair. The majority of the
lawyers associated with various wings of
the litigation and representing the ma
jority of heirs and claimants appeared at
the opening of court in response to the
order of Judge Troutt. made on the 20th
inst., requiring James S. Angus and
Thomas G. Crothers, executors of the
will of the deceased capitalist, to appear
yesterday and' show cause why leave to
hie a complaint in intervention in the
contest instituted by Charles L. Fair to
his father's will should not be granted
to Mrs. Nettie R. Craven.
Pierson and Mitchell appeared for the
executors Garret McEnerney for various
heirs. Knight and Hoggerty for Charles
I, Fair and \V. W. Foote and Densnn,
Oatman' & Denson for Mrs. Craven. The
argument of the issues of law involved
There are over 10,000 men who sing the praises
of Dr. Sanden. They are men who have been lifted
to the highest pinnacle of manly vigor by his famous
Electric Belt. They are to be found in every town
and hamlet in the West. There is not a town on the
Pacific Coast but has from one to twenty cures by
this great strengthen There must be something in a
system of treatment that can show such cures as this:

was much speculation as to which siae
he would lean. It was the Crimmins side,
and he made his price the chairmanship .
of the Supplies and Evening Schools com
mittees. These were given him and Head j
became at once a ruling power on tne
board. â, ,
.-a the same time Superintendent \\ co-
Bter Bhowed his kindly feeling for the In
fluential Mr. Crimmins by giving to him
the appointment of the secretary. Mr,
Webster waa considered a more valuable
yeoman by the astute Crimmiiis than
even Mr. Head, and therein lay .Mr.
Head's opportunity to dig as rapidly as .
ho might his own political grave. He j
took advantage of It by "going up
against" Superintendent Webster and his
executive policy at every time opportun
ity offered.
Head claimed publicly that Webster
was usurping the functions of members of
the board, and suggested that if the one
man power were to be inaugurated
it be done at once and Webster be given
free rein. For a time Webster appar
ently did what Head accused him of, but i
only for the reason that it waa the policy ,
of the board to let him go on until the ;
members had sufficient knowledge of af
fairs to do business by themselves. As a j
momlier of the previous board, however,
Head thought there was some considera
tion due his experience, and he fought
Webster at every turn, notwithstanding i
they both acknowledged the same mas- i
ter, until linally the Crimmins people :
tired of it and warned him against any
further attempts at making political cap- !
ital by fighting the Superintendent.
The warning went unheeded, and Head
went so far as to arbitrarily order closed
a number of the evening schools. Web
ster would not stand such action, anu
at the next meeting the board backed ,
him up by reopening the schools in the
face of strong opposition by Head. Then
it developed that Head was not giving
his public duties the time they required,
and Webster complained that he was
withholding needed supplies from him,
even to the postage stamps necessary to
the business of his office. That completed i
Head's alienation from the Crimmins !
crowd. The other side had no use for |
him, and he was given the tip that he j
was to be ousted. A committee headed ;
by President Bergerot took up his duties \
and made needed inspections of the even-
Ing BChools, and is now ready to report, j
Since then Head has spent the better part
of his time in a vain attempt to square |
himself with his political chaperon, Crim
mins.
It was of no avail, however, for yester
day the plan for his undoing was com- !
pleted, and the resolutions that are to re
move him were made ready for presenta- i
tion to-night if the time shall prove pro
pitious. For once the board have united '
on one project, and the votes of all of
them, so it is claimed, will be cast in the i
affirmative in the prescmt case. If it ac
complishes nothing else it will give the |
clean faction an opportunity to regain :
their ascendency in board matters, and '
the fight bids fair to be a warm one.
did not proceed as expected. A continu
ance was requested on behalf of the ex
ecutors, hut would not be consented to
by -Mrs. Craven's lawyers until they were
assured that the contest instituted by
Charles L. Fair would not be withdrawn
uni.l such time as argument could be had
regarding Mrs. Craven's right to tile a
complaint for intenvention. This was
agreed to and the case was continued un
til a week from Friday.
The issues upon which the executors
will combat Mrs. Craven's application to
flic her complaint were then made known.
Written application was filed .by the exe
cutors on the ground that the proceed
ing instituted by Charles L. Fair to con
test the validity of the will is a special
proceeding and the law does not author
ize an intervention in such actions; that
it does not appear that Mrs. Craven has
such an interest in the matter In litiga
tion as will entitle her to Intervene
therein, and that the time allowed by law
in which to file such complaint has ex
pired.
Upon these grounds the opposition will
make its fight to prevent Sirs. Craven
breaking into the case instituted by her
alleged stepson, but witn what success
remains to be seen.

Gage was not In fault. Then the case

has ever been received here, the amount
of copra arriving representing the shred
ding of from 40,000,000 to 50,'j00.000 cocoa
nuts. Everything is reported quiet in
Tahiti. The war scare has long since
passed away, and it is said that the Gov
ernor of the islands has received a severe
reprimand for his action in placing the
town of Tahiti in a posture of defense.
It will be rem.-mbered that the Governor
actually believed that war had broken out
between England and France and so pre
pared for a vigorous defense against the
attack of English war vessels. He brought
the French gunboat alongside the quay,
dismounted her guns, placed them on the
heights, issued rations for ninety days to
the Inhabitants and established interior
lines of defense against the enemy that
never came. His patriotism has resulted

POPULAR ENTHUSIASM AROUSED OVER
THE EXTENSION OF THE PANHANDLE
Thousands of Workmen, Laborers, Artisans and Me
chanics Will Find Employment in the Gigantic
Undertaking to Improve the City.
MAP OF THE PROPOSED EXTENSION OF THE PARK PANHANDLE.
FROM present indications it will
be impossible to hold a special
bond election before next De
cember to determine whether or
not the people of the city wish
an elaborate municipal system of sew
ers, adequate public buildings, hos
pitals and the extension of the pan
handle of Golden Gate Park to Van
Ness avenue. The preliminary work of
preparation for such an election is mi
i tricate and cannot be hastened, al
though the local authorities are work
ing as rapidly as possible. Plans, speci
fications, estimates and rough ap
praisements must be made before the
election can, under the law, be held.
Public sentiment Is rapidly crystalliz
ing into an eager advocacy of the pro
posed improvements, particularly that
of the extension of the panhandle.
This support is being given more es
pecially by the generality of the people,
by men and women of the middle
classes, by those in moderate circum
stances and the poor. To these classes,
who constitute the great bulk of the
population of San Francisco, the ex
tension of the panhandle means an
inestimable benefit as yet but poorly
understood even by those who value it
most.
The tremendous undertaking which
the Mayor and the Board of Supervis
ors are projecting is meeting also with
the favor of the residents' of the out-
Bide districts, who will be benefited by
the accession of new sewers, hospitals
and other incidental improvements.
The extension of the panhandle appeals
particularly to the people In the inside
districts. Those living south of Market
street, down town as well as in the
Mission, will be benefited quite as much
as those residing north of Market
street.
For people In every part of the city j

a new park domain will be created for
recreation, enjoyment, fresh air and
health. An erroneous opinion seems to
have gained some currency that the
extension of the panhandle will mean
simply that those who can afford to
drive to Golden Gate Park will have a
longer drive and that people who need
a park will be neglected. This Is alto
gether an error. Whatever objection
has been made to the extension of the
panhandle has come from wealthy men
who balk at a public Improvement
when that improvement touches their
pockets. These men look upon the pan
handle as It exists now from Stanyan

street to Baker street as a necessary
evil. Most of them do not utilize it on
their way to the park, but drive out
Fell street.
They are not concerned, therefore, in
having the panhandle extended and
they have not been Blow to utter a
protest because the proposed extension
will cost them a considerable sum of
money. They are not concerned in the
fact that the tremendous undertaking
of extending the panhandle will give
thousands of workmen, laborers, arti
sans and mechanics employment for
years. It will take time and money to
effect the great change and to trans
form a little city Into a great garden.
This money will be paid to the very
men for whose benefit the new park is
to be created and the coin will be paid
very larg* ly by the men who drive now
in their splendid teams to Golden Gate
Park.
In order that the character of the
change to be. made by the proposed ex
tension of the panhandle may be
thoroughly understood a map of the
projected improvement is published
this morning. The present panhandle
begins at Stanyan street' and ends at
Baker street. The extension from that
point to Van Ness avenue between
Oak and Fell streets is natural and in
a straight line. Long before the city
was what it is now such an extension
was planned and advocated. "When the
site of the City Hall was a cemetery
the creators of Golden Gate Park, with
almost prophetic vision, saw that some
day Golden Gate Park must start in
the very heart of the city and then take
its direct course to the ocean beach.
But these men had to fight stubborn
ly for years to get Golden Gate Park,
and at last they were forced to give
way and sacrifice the splendid park
that would have begun at Stanyan
street and ended at the City Hall. Only
the strip from Stanyan to Baker was
saved and it remains to-day to show
what the people of the city ought to do.
Under the proposed plan of extension
the new panhandle will bo in every
sense a great and beautiful park. It
will be ample to provide occupation for
the thousands that now seek Golden
Gate Park. It will be adorned with
statuary, fountains, arbors and a floral
wealth which has made Golden Gate
Park one of the great garden spots of
the world. In every sense it will be a
park stretching block after block
toward the west untjl it broadens out
into the splendid domain of the park
proper.
It is this prospect which has caught
and will hold popular enthusiasm until
the day when with ballots the voters
of the city decide to make the prospect
a reality and to acquire a new recrea
tion ground which will be without
parallel among the cities of America
and perhaps of the world.
TO ASSESS GOODS NOT
HERETOFORE TAXED
ADVISORY EXPERT PLATT TO
SUBMIT HIS REPORT.
Personal Property Assessment Com
mittee of the Supervisors Will
Meet To-Bay to Take Offi
cial Action.
The personal property assessment
committee of the Board of Supervisors
will hold a meeting to-day in order to
hear the report of Advisory Expert Al
fred G. Platt regarding certain property
which has heretofore escaped taxation.
Mr. Platt will submit a tabulated state
ment of such properties and the commit
tee will decide whether it will be advis
able to turn the data over to Assessor
Dodge or submit it to the Board of
Equalization, which meets on the first
Monday In July.
Mr. I'latt Js extremely desirous of act- !
ing in harmony with the Assessor, al
though the latter declined to appoint him
as a deputy In order to arrive at the con
clusions which he has embodied in his
report to the committee. The Assessor
has everything in hand at the present S
time with regard to assessments, and Air. i
]'!;Ut's duties consisted in learning how I
much property has missed being taxed.
Should the report be turned over to the
BOr he ran make the additional as- I
sessmonts accordingly, lie Is liable un
der under his bond if he does not make
a proper asw ssment, and the informa
tion of Mr. Platt will puido him in arriv
ing at correct valuations. Mr. l'latt's re
will be a comprehensive review of
the situation.
In regard to merchandise in bond, the
opinion which was recently handed down
by the City and County Attorney is rath
er equivocal, and it is difficult to iix the
taxation on such goods in the hands of
the original importer and in the original
packages. As soon as a package is brok- j
en, however, it enters Into the merchan- !
dlse of the State and as such must be
taxed.
In the case of goods bottled In bond
they would come under the head of pri
vate bonded warehouses and as such
would bo taxable. In the matter of whis
kies withdrawn from the internal reve
nue bonded warehouse In Kentucky, for
example, and exported for sale in foreign
markets and brought back to the United
a and placed in a bonded warehouse
at a port of entry, It is held that g
of that class are not in the strict sense
Imported from a foreign country and in
fact are not treated as such by the Gov
ernment, which exacts only the internal
revenue tax and not the duty imposed on
foreign liquors. This point has not as
yet been definitely settled by the Su
premo Court, but the contention is that
such reimported liquors should be taxed
as personal property.
The national banks come in for a share
of Mr. Platt's attention in his report. The
act regulating their operations provides
that such banks shall be obliged to invest
in Government bonds to the extent of 90
per cent of their circulating issue. This is
a technical loan to the Government, and if
the funds cannot be taxed the shares of
Btock earning dividends can be. Mr. Platt
is now tabulating the reports filed by the
national banks with tho Bank Commission
en March 4 with a view to assessing on
something more than the franchises, on
which they have only paid taxes in the
past.
With regard to the premiums outstand
ing and in process or collection by fire,
marine and lifo insurance companies in
corporated j n foreign countries. It is ex
pected that largo revenues will bo derived
therefrom, if they are held to be solvent
( redlts. It is a fact that $6,000,000 are sent
away from the Pacific Coast every year
which never pays a cent of tax. Consid
ering that the lire insurance companies
have suffered only a 28 per cent loss ratio
during the past twenty years, it seems but
fair that they should bo compelled to bear
the slight burden of V/ 2 per cent taxation
for State purposes. They reap the benefits
of fire, police, judiciary and other pro
tections, but have never contributed to
their maintenance', at least by paying tax
es on what are held to be solvent credits.
POOL-SELLING CASES.
The Batch in Judge Conlan's Court
Are Continued Till May 10 to
Be Set.
The cases of H. L. Jones and others, ar
rested at the racetrack for violating the
new poolselling ordinance, were called in
Judge Conlan's court yesterday to be set
for trial. Chief Lees and Captain Witt
man were in court.
Attorney Ach, for the defendants, moved
that the cases be continued for a year,
as there would be no more racing at the
Ingleslde track, but Prosecuting Attorney
Low retorted that such a motion was
ridiculous, and the Judge promptly re
fused It. After argument the Jones case
was continued till May 10 to be set.
The Judge, in speaking of the matter
later, said: "I was willing at the first call
ing of the cases to try onft, but the police
told me that as the arrests were made on
the second day the cases in my court were
not so strong as those in Judge Mogan's
court, and they wanted mine continued,
which has been done from time to time.
To my surprise, the police came into my
court this morning and said they were
ready to proceed and asked that the casea
be set. I am going on my annual vaca
tion at the end of the month and there
foro cannot try the rases, but I have set
them for May iv and the pollco can got an
other Judge to come into my court and
try them. Judge Low had never been con
sulted by an official of the Police Depart
ment frc-m the first calling of the cases."
Secretary Freud Will Lecture.
J. Richard Freud, secretary of the Mer
chants' Association, will speak on "Civil
Service in Public Office" before Liberty-

FRUIT AND SALMON IN ENGLAND.
California!] fruits are steady, says the Lon
don Grocers' Gazette, but with supplies mostly
cut of first hands, and with the wholesale
and retail trade getting deliveries of their
previous purchases, transactions are not num
erous. Business in salmon has been rather ills
appointing, end the principal portion of ar
rivals are belnt; stored for demand, which is
likely to arise with tiner weather. a fairly
pood trade has continued in half-pound tins,
and supplies are being distributed to retailers.
Prices are well maintained.
DRIED FRUITS IN NEW YORK.
The New York Commercial Advertiser cays:
â¢â¢Raisins are unchanged. There is a mod
erate demand for all descriptions of California
poods, but no large sales have been reported
this week. Occasional car lots are taken, but
in the main buyers content .themselves with
small lots. Foreign, raisins are dull, and or
ders are limited to small requests to cover
urgent needs of retailers.
"Prunes are steady. Prices tend upward on
best qualities. The lnsiite price for Santa
Claras, basis for four sizes. is said to be
3\c with some holders asking 7 -Â« c. A 4c
market is in sight, according to private ad
vices received from California. Spot prices re
main steady at quotations with upward ten
dency on all best grades. Oregon Italians ap
pear to be more wanted, and prices are well
maintained.
"Peaches meet restricted demand because of
high prices. Consumers want peaches, but
present figures ate much too stiff to attract
liberal buying.
"Apricots are unchanged. Holders are not es
pecially anxious to dispose of holdings, and
Btlck closely to published prices. Sales are
comparatively few. â .'â '..''â  only for small lots."
THE OUTLOOK FOR WHEAT.
The Toledo Market Report says: "It is
not a. "bullish" feature that spring wheat seed
ing r.i â¢> promises to be earlier than last year.
It is a strong point gained in favor of a crop
corresponding to last year, it is not a "bull
ish' feature that cur export movement has
largely decreased. That movement last week
was less than 30 per cent of the world's ship
ments. The seaboard reports daily sales, but
they are more for covering previous 'short'
sales by foreigners than for export. Crop
killing reports have advanced American prices
above a parity with England. It is not a
"bullish" feature that a 1 great number of mills
In the winter wheat area are closed, because
no rrarket for flour can be found, even at cost
on present wheat prices. It is not a 'bullish
feature that every foreign wheat country
makes a good report of the growing wheat.
All of them promise an average to a full
crop. The decidedly 'bullish' feature Is the
condition of our winter wheat. What the loss
will he cannot now be determined, but It Is
eerlous. If we produce but 300,000.000 bushels
of winter wheat and a full crop of spring
wheat, and crops abroad come in full aver
age, do the present prices reflect the situa
tion? That's the conundrum."

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, April 25.â Dealings In stocks
to-day were rather dull. The market was gen
erally heavy In the forenoon, while In the after
noon strength appeared, especially among those
stocks which had been depressed early. The
Grangers initiated the Improvement coinci
dent with the weakness in wheat. London was
a f-oller of the Internationals, particularly of
Louisville â â â  Southern. Although the profes
sional element was bearish, speculation
throughout displayed an undertone of resist
ance which caused 'many of the trading ele
ment to reverse their tactics. Among the gen
erally inactive shares very material advances
appeared In Minneapolis and St. Louis. Detroit
Gas, Canadian Pacific and Illinois Central.
Anaconda Mining advanced sharply on con
tinued gossip connecting it with the proposed
consolidation. Sugar, Glucose and Metropoli
tan were well supported, and Tennessee Coal
more than recovered from its early weakness.
Gossip was revived of some alliance among
sugar and glucose interests, but nothing defl-'
nite wan made known In this connection, par
ties who should know being non-committal. In
the money and sterling exchange markets
steadiness prevailed at practically unchanged
quotations. Strength prevailed In the dealings
until near the close, when realizing, especially
In Manhattan and other transportation shares,
cut off part of the advance, leaving the mar
ket weak, although a number of shares retained
good advances on the day.
Business In bonds was well distributed to
day and prices were in the main higher. Total
Bales, $3.C55.000.

STANFORD UNIVERSITY, April 25.â As the result
of a daring expedition undertaken last night by
twenty-two Stanford students the far-famed
B< rkeley fence, the traditional seat of the seniors,
rests new at Palo Alto in the possession of the
supporters of the cardinal.
The mammoth wooden "C" was removed from its sup
ports at 2:15 a. m., loaded on a wagon and brought around
the bay, arriving at the university about 1 p. m. The party
in charge of the trophy was met near Alviso by a large
body of Stanford students and escorted to the campus.
As the university was approached scores of men joined
the procession at different points along the road. By the
time the entrance t<: the college was reached the escort
numbered about sno. some being on wheels, in carriages
and buses, while ott-.ers were on foot.
The enterprise waÃ decided on yesterday noon. Most
of those who were to participate left on the afternoon
trains for Oakland. Four students, however, conducted
the wagon which was to cany the trophy to Stanford
d the bay.
-While the main party was waiting there to proceed to
Berkeley half of the members left for Piedmont, where
they secured a wagon. On entering Berkeley the difficul
ties began, for two special policemen, hired to watch the
university premises, followed the rig. The Stanford men
were In d< spalr. Then a plan to triok the officers was
worked out. As the night was dark, two men were to be
dropped from the wagon as every corner was rounded. At
last, when but four occupants were left, the policemen
overtook the men and searched the wagon. Nothing was
found and their mimls were made easy when they were
told the affair was a Berkeley D. K. E. initiation.
After apologising for his foolish alarm The policeman
told the men that he had believed them from Stanford on
ittempt to recapture the ax. "He Beemed to bo
prejudiced against the Stanford men." paid one of the
party "for he made terrible tin-eats against us and do
's he would 'jug 1 every Stanford student." The
campus watchman was led astray by two of the students
in a buggy, which they drove over the Berkeley hills.
In the meantime the majority at the party wasftt work
on th'- fence. It was taken In its entirety and carted to
? which was in waiting near Haywards. After
the transfer the triumphal procession toward Palo Alto
was begun. It consumed over ten hours.
The students heard the news with th<=> wilaest delight.
Tn an instant, every classroom and lab< ratory was de-
I. The band was summoned and the "jollying up"
continued until 3 o'clock.

There are many reasons given for the
change of the location of the seminary,
but one of the most pressing is the â

bees acknowledged by the trustees that
the institution could be conducted as ef

so high and where land is not so valu

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, APRIL 26, 1899.
TJiE .HISTORIC FEME.
BERKELEY. April 25.â The ax feud between Stan
ford and Berkeley is not over. Failing in an at
tempt to recover their stolen mascot by raiding
one of the fraternity houses of the amiverslty
town at 3 o'clock in the morning, some days ago,
the Stanford men have avenged their loss by stealing the
senior fence from the Berkeley campus and carting it
bodily down to Palo Alto. This work of retaliation they
carried out successfully last night In a manner quite simi
lar to the previous raid.
In the dead of night a small band of cardinal enthusi
asts stole into town, bringing with them a heavy wagon.
Their point of rendezvous was near the bridge at the
upper end of the campus, close by College avenue. Think
ing the coast clear they started in the direction of the
fence, but encountered the nlghtwatchman near the
library. They succeeded in passing off as
Berkeley students and engaged the officer in conversation^
for over an hour upon the library Steps. It seemed as
though their second raid were doomed to failure unless tho
watchman oould be disposed of. In despair they pretended
to start for home, and the officer seeing them depart
walked over to the lower campus. The Stanford men
watched their chance, and hastening toward the fence
lifted it out of the ground, broke it Into sections and load
ing it on the wagon In waiting hurried away with tho
spoils. It was all done noiselessly, without any alarm
being Riven.
When the U. C. men came to recitations this morning
they were highly amused at the cardinal strategy. One
and all declared the josh to be on Stanford. The senior
fence was a weather-beaten concern erected by tho class
of '98, and consisted of a few planks arranged on supports
in the shape of a big C. It was not a college affair, but
belonged only to the class of '98, and had already out
lived Its usefulness when the class graduated a year ago.
Arrangements had been made to tear the thing down be
fore the end of the present term, as its presence could be
tolerated no longer. The Berkeley students smiled as they
thought of Stanford's success in ridding them of an old
eyesore, and they are congratulating themselves on seeing
it go. A section of them, .disposed to carry the josh still
further, are raising a subscription to send the cardinal the
sum of 50 cents, declaring that the expre.ssage ought not
to have been done gratuitously.
nil-important question occupied the whole
of the afternoon and lasted until a late
hour last night.
At Ita conclusion a hallot was taken on
the advisability of changing, the location
of the seminary from its present site to
one in Berkeley, as near as possible to
the State University grounds. The ballot
was almost unanimously in favor of the
change, the faculty and trustees not vot-
Ing, as they had called the conference as
advisory to themselves, ami final decision
ng with them In any event.
This action of the joint meeting was
offi< lally brought before the board of
trustees at its meeting this afternoon,
and after further discussion a unanimous
vote was taken committing the institu
tion to the change of location.
The property on which the Pacific The
ological Seminary has been located for
a third of a century consists of between
eight and nine acres on a knoll at the
head of Webster street, between Tele
graph avenue and Broadway, and above
St. Mary's College. It will make one of
the finest residence properties in the city,
and is to be sold by the trustees in ac
cordance with orders. . .
The board of trustees is composed of
Rev. John K. McLean. D.D. (president),
Rev. W. C. Pond, D.D. (secretary). Ed
ward P. Flint, James M. Haven (treas
urer), Rev. Henry E. Jewett, James E.

thaniel P. Cole. Rev. Walter Frear,
Charles Holbrook, Rev.' George Mooar,
D.D. James L. Barker, Rev. Leland D.

George C. Adams, D.D.
Rev. Dr. McLean has been president of
the board for the past twenty years, and
managing president of the institution for
five years. He and the faculty heartily
approve the new plan, and would gladly
welcome any and all other, similar instl
tions to their neighborhood and a free
participation in all the advantages.
"Though we will leave our present
beautiful site with regret," said Presi
dent McLean to a' Call reporter after
the meeting, "we feel that new condl

tinns bring new responsibilities; and
sentiment must be sacrificed for the best
interests .of education. For several
months the question has oeen under dis
cussion whether the usefulness and real
power of the seminary might not he in
creased by placing it in proximity
to the State University. Our students
have for years been taking more and
more studies from the university and we
are anxious that we should avail our
selves more largely of the facilities there.
â  The changes taking place all the while
in society require the minister to be edu
cated more broadly than twenty-five
years ago. He needs to add to the old
standard branches some knowledge of the
new questions that have come forward
In . the life of this community. Upon the
other hand, as the university develops it
is putting into its own curriculum a great
many things which an isolated seminary
would have to furnish for Itself."
The graduating- exercises were also held
at the seminary to-day, the chief fea
ture being an able address by Rev. George
B. Hatch of Berkeley on "The Person
ality of the Preacher." Among the grad
uates were F. C. Krause of Washington;
also C. K. Takeda, who. after he shall
have concluded a two years' post gradu
ate course in divinity studies at Yale, will
return to Japan. The class was the
smallest in several years, owing to some
new adjustment in the curriculum. The
curriculum of the institution is now to be
materially changed and a committee has
been appointed to consider this particu
lar subject. The new features will be
partially put into operation with the
opening of the next seminary year which
will hereafter be at the same time as that
of the State University.
The alumni held a meeting this after
noon and thoroughly approved, by resolu
tion, the policy the seminary has adopted
and renewing assurances of Its hearty co
operation. '--.--

NO LIQUOR AT
RAILROAD DEPOTS
Sweeping Order Issued to Go
Into Effect on June 1.
OAKLAND OFFICE SANT FRANCISCO CALL, 908 Broadway. April 25.
ONE of the .Host sweeping orders ever issued by the Southern Pacific
Company concerning the behavior and well-being of its employes goes
into effect June 1. It forbids tfie sale of liquor at restaurants connected
with the depots where such restaurants are rented from the railroad
company. As nearly every restaurant on the Western division is
rented from the railroad company this order has a very wide scope.
For many years the Southern Pacific has habitually .^siied orders for
bidding its employ-s from entering saloons when on duty and sometimes when
off duty. In many instances the trainmen have obtained their liquor at the
bars attached to the restaurants along their runs, and eight years ago the
first command was sent out that such places should not bo visited by em
ployes. Since then the number of saloon-restaurants at depots has grown
and the trainmen if they had felt inclined have found every facility to dis
obey the orders of the company.
The order just issued will cut off a large portion of the revenue of the
railroad company, for at the several stations rents for restaurants have
largely increased after the proprietors have obtained licenses to sell liquor.
Originally the rent paid at Nlles, for instance, was $10. Gradually it has crept
up till now the proprietor pays $40, and he has declared that when the order
goes into effect he will have to go out of business, for a large part of his in
come is derived from selling liquor. Of course, not only to trainmen, but to
passengers.
At several of the depots on this division men who have started In these
saloon-restaurants have grown rich on their profits, for it is customary to
charge two or three prices for drinks, and there was also a large business
done in flasks. Occasionally when a one-day or Sunday excursion passes
through some of these depots where saloon-restaurants are maintained hun
dreds of dollars have been spent while the train remained a few minutes!
with the result that before the passengers reached Oakland or San Francisco
there would be several wrecked cars and broken limbs.
Owen Rooney, the proprietor of the restaurant at the pi^-r. Bays his tface
does not come within the scope of the order, as his restaurant is away from
the depot and not under the jurisdiction entirely of the railroad company.

NEILL WON FROM
TRACEY ON A FOUL
OTTS KNOCKED OUT JOHNSON IN
THE FIBST ROUND.
â â â â
Martin Denny Proved to Be an Easy-
Mark for Hard-Hitting
Jimmie Lawlor.
Professor Walter Watson made a ten
strike last evening as a judge of pugilistic
contests by awarding 1 the fight between
Al Neill and Tom Tracey to the former
on a foul '
The pugilists fought twenty rounds, and
in the last round Tracey, having been
cautioned several times during the mill
not to hit in a clinch, after being ordered
to break, again transgressed the rule and
the referee quickly ordered the contest
ants to their respective corners and, plac
ing his hand on Neill's shoulders, said,
"You are the winner." The decision was
received by the gallery and pit with
rounds of cheers for Neill and Referee
Watson.
The contest was a good one. It pleased
all present excepting those who take no
interest in the gaone of fisticuffs unless
it is composed of wild slogging, with facts
painted with gore. Neill proved that he
is a most promising candidate for honors
against the best men who represent the
145-pound class of professional fighters.
Although in a number of rounds Tracey
had the better of the contest on points, it
must be said that the battle was pretty
even up to the nineteenth round, al
though there were several hundred people
among the crowd who could see only one
man in the fight and his name was Neill.
Several times Tracey stopped Neill's
leads with his gloves, but the friends of
the local man thought that Neill landed
each time.
Tracey was In the pink of condition,
and those who witnessed the mill saw
him put up the best argument since his
arrival from Australia, but he could not
draw his opponent out, notwithstanding
the many fancy maneuvers he executed
during the contest. Tracey tried every
trick he knew of to get Neill to lower his
guard and give him (Tracey) an oppor
tunity to land the right on "the jaw, but
Neill wu.-; cool and kept the vulnerable
point w.-H protected, excepting in one
or two hot rallies, when Tracey sent home
a right upper cut that dazed the receive r.
In the first round Tracey somewhat be
wildered Neill by his rapid movements
and beautiful side stepping. He planted
his left glove on Neill's face several
times, but the blows were light. In the
second round Neill grew more confident
and was willing to tafce the love laps
in exchange for one or two right hand
smashes at any part of Tracey's body.
In a mix-up Neill landed a left swing on
Tracey's neck and in breakaway he Hung
the Australian down. In the third Neill
got home three stiff punches on Tracey's
neck and body, but caught a hard left
smash on the nose. I-n breaking from a
right clinch both fighters sprawled on the
floor.
1 Miring the fourth round Tracey jumped
around Neill like a grasshopper, but was'
stopped] suddenly by a stiff body blow,
which was followed by rapid exchanges
at close range, out of which Tracey came
a surprised man, as Neill sent him down
with a left-hander on the neck. The Aus
tralian was up quickly and smiled
blandly.
In the fifth, sixth and seventh rounds
Tracey changed his style of fighting and
resorted to tactics of stabbing his oppo
nent in the stomach at long range. By
this method he expected that Neill would
lower his guard for the chin, but the
game did not pan out as Tracey expected.
Still, Tracoy waa rapidly scoring up
points.
In the eighth round the Australian
came very near bagging the home man.
After a series of exchanges Neill made
a wicked left swing for Tracey's pointed
jaw, which the Australian ducked like a
flash and then caught Neill a hard short
arm righthand punch on the jaw. which
caused Neill's knees to bend under him.
Tracey shook Neill from a clinch and
tried hard to end the game, but failed in
the attempt. Neill went to his corner
very Kroppy. The time clock saved him.
In the tenth Tracey was hissed for hit
! ting in the clinches.
The eleventh round was the most ex
' citing of the evening. The fighters mixed
I matters up and Neill happened to catch
i Tracey a hard right swing on the ear
which staggered the Australian. Neill,
seeing his opportunity, went at Tracey
wildly, rind the Australian, by remark
ably clever ducking and clinching, got
back his senses and caught Neill a fear
ful smash on the jaw which sent Neill
staggering- and clinching. Tracey again
tried to finish Neill, and during "the ex
citement the sports above and below
were on their feet and shouting like mad
men. Traecy hit Neill another hard
smash in the mouth as the gong sounded
for corners.
After this the fighters were pretty well
pumped, and the exchanges at closerange
were not so numerous until the final
round, when Tracey again tried to land
his right and failing in the attempt he
! struck Neill. in a clinch and lost the fight.
Billy Otts knocked out Charley Johnson
in the first round, and Jimmy Lawlor pot
a decision from Joe Acton over the Aus
tralian. Martin Denny, who did not seem
tn be trying to bag his man very hard,
although Law'or fought well.

ADVERTISEMENTS.
CATARRH OP THE STOMACH.
A Pleasant, Simple, Safe but Effectual Cure
for It.
Catarrh of the stomach has long been
considered the next thing to incurable.
The usual symptoms are a full or
bloated sensation after .eating, accom- '
panied sometimes with sour or watery
risings, a formation of gases, causing
pressure on the iungs and heart and
difficult breathing; headache, fickle ap-
petite, nervousness and a i general
played out and languid feeling. â¢ \
There is often a foul taste in the
mouth, coated tongue, and if the inter-
ior of the stomach could â¢ be seen it
would show a slimy, inflamed condition.
The cure for this common and ob-
stinate disease is found in "a treatment
which causes the food to be readily and
thoroughly digested before it has time
to ferment and irritate the delicate
mucous surface of the stomach.
To secure a prompt and healthy di-
gestion is the one necessary thing to
do, and when normal digestion is se-
cured the catarrhal condition will have
disappeared.
According to Dr. Harlanson the safest
and- best treatment is to use after each
meal a tablet, composed of Diastase,
Aseptic Pepsin, a little Nux, Golden
Seal and fruit acids.
These tablets can now be found at all
drugstores under the name of Stuart's
Dyspepsia Tablets, and, not being a
patent medicine, can be used with
perfect safety and assurance that
healtHy appetite and thorough diges-
tion will follow their regular use after
meals.
Mr. N. J. Booher of 2710 Dearborn
street, Chicago, 111., writes: "Catarrh
is a local condition, resulting from a
neglected cold in the head, whereby the
lining membrane of the nose becomes
inflamed and the poisonous discharge
therefrom, passing back into the throat,
reaches the. stomach, thus producing
catarrh of the stomach. Medical au-
thorities prescribed for me three years
for- catarrh of the stomach without
cure, but to-day I am the happiest of
men after using only one box of j
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets. I; - cannot
find appropriate words to express my
good feeling. 1 have found flesh, ap-
petite and sound rest from their use "
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets is the
safest preparation as well as the sim-
plest and most convenient remedy for
any form of indigestion, catarrh of the
stomach, biliousness, sour stomach,
heartburn and bloating after meals.

ach troubles, by addressing the F. A.

lets can be found at all drugstores.

REAL PROPERTY
Many Buyers Seeking
Investments.
A FEW BIG DEALS CLOSED
AGENTS ARE WELL SATISFIED
WITH THE OUTLOOK.
Temporary Falling Off in the Number
of Sales Recorded Not Due to
Any Reaction in the
Market.
The real estate market has been very
quiet during the past week, but while |
actual transactions were light the de
mand for Improved, income-producing 1
property continues active, with a num- .
ber of good-sized deals, on the verge of
being consummated. The sale of the
Tubbs mansion on Jackson street, near
Steiner, which was concluded early last'j
woek, wae the largest single transaction :
noted. Shainwald, Buckbee & Co. also
closed a deal by which Rudolph Bpreck
els becomes the owner of a triangular
piece of property with a frontage of 74.6
feet on O'Farrell' street, with a depth of
337.6 feet and having a 60-foot frontage
on Elwood alley. The big piece of
ground was owned by a number of par- j
ties and part of it was secured some time
ago. The transfer of the O'Farrell street
frontage, however, was not made until
Monday. The tire purchase represents I
an investment of >â " 000. It is the pur- !
pose of the new owner to erect a first- j
class building on the property, although
â¢it may be some time before active opera
tions are begun.
Nearly twenty building .permits have
been taken out during- the past week, the
amounts involved aggregating between
J:Â«t,!VVi and $100,000. This a in addition. to ,
several big buildings that are soon to go
up, including the new opera-house on
Geary street and the big store and office
building on the corner of Geary and
Stockton streets. The latter is to be |
erected by C. C. Black, the capitalist,
who owns the property, and the work or i
tearing down the old buildings that now
encumber the site is pressing rapidly.
The Kit is 137x137, and Mr. Black will put
up a building that will be R credit to the
city and the location. The foundation
will be put in for a ten-story building, al
though it is probable that the structure
at present contemplated will not be over
six stories in height. It will cost about
$100,000.
The new building to be erected by
Henry Kahn on Ellis street, between
Powell and Mason, will cost in the neigh-.
borhood of $175,000.
A. J. Rich & Co. yesterday executed a
leasehold of the store and basement at j
the corner of Grant avenue and Geary |
street to R. P. Davis of Sacramento. |
The lease is for live years at a monthly
rental of ?550. The lessoxs are Davis
Brothers; no relation to the lessee.
Loans have been fairly good during the
past week, but only one for an unusual- j
Fy large amount was recorded, that of i
the German Savings Bank, of $67,000 to
John and Hannah McDonald on the prop
erty at the northwest corner of Devlsa
ri< ro and Eddy. -

"PUT UP YOUR
HAMMERS," SAYS
JULIUS KAHN
More State Pride Is
Needed Here.
ALL SHOULD WORK TOGETHER
TH.b CONGRESSMAN STATES
SOME PLAIN TRUTHS.
Lectures Entertainingly on "Califor
nia â Past, Present and Future,"
for the Benefit of Young
Men's Institute.
Congressman Julius Kahn. lectured last
right before a large audience in Odd Fel
lows' Hall under the auspices of Stross
mayer and rke Councils, Young Men's
Institute, The lecture chosen for his
theme was "California, Past, Present and
Future." lie has an abounding faith in
this State, believing it will shortly rank
as one of the most prosperous sections
of the world. Speaking of California as
it is to-day he said:
If the people of California had more
Stato pride it would be of inestima
ble value to the State. We all love it,
but we need to forget our petty jeal
ousies and our envy of Individuals, by
which we stand in the way of our
great enterprises. We have too many
men with "hammers out" ready to hit
a head wherever they see. one. There
is too much personal spite and per
sonal jealousy which warps men's
judgment. Whenever any one pro
poses a great movement the tirst
question is "what is ho going to make
out o" it and what does he want?"
fOur citizens should cultivate State
pride and help the State along. They
should bury the dog-in-the-manger,
childish, peevish policy ' which has
characterized them in the pastâ cast
aside their policy of "if I cannot, thou
shalt not."
The lack of State pride is respon
sible for much of the backwardness of
this country. There should be no
sectionalism hen?â no Northern Cali- j
fornia, no Southern Californiaâ as '
though this State was divided into two
commercial nations struggling for su
premacy, instead of one great State
wit! one end nnd one object in view
that of prosperity and progress. That
man should be expelled and ostra
cized from the. State who would stir
up any sectional differences. The fu
ture is brighter than ever was dreamed
of. As has been said by able men. the
future commerce of the world will be :
found on the Pacific Ocean. This is
â¢ about to be realized, and California
will come in for the greater share of
The speaker traced the history of Cal- i
ifornia back several centuries, conveying
a mass of historical facts in â  a highly
entertaining maner.

THE patriotic sentimeni behind

day "i* May will hereafter be
known and designated in the
United States, is peculiarly gr
and appropriate. On that day the
American arms, lone: while

miral to its pristine plory. never again
abated or diminished; and on

Such are the views of Hon. Edward
THREE FIRMS TO
BE LICENSED TO
RUN POOLROOMS
Trustee Sylva Alters
His Opinion.
KINGSLEY & CO. WELCOMED
SAUSALITO WILL SOON BE A
"WIPE OPEN" TOWN.
Talk of Special Elections and Disin
corporation, by Which Super
visors Were Delayed,
Is Dropped.
The talk of disincorporate at Sausa
lito in order to delude the Board of Su
pervisors of Marln County into thinking
there will be no need for them to pass an
ordinance virtuaJly prohibitive of the pool
room traffic in that "wide open" town
has be^n entirely dropped. Trustee Sylva,
the "boss," to whom all searchers after
wealth by chance in Marln must come
with their petition, has so decreed. More
over, there is to be no special election to
be held to determine whether or not the
people of Sausalito want the poolroom*
this year.
"The people voted seven to one for th<>
poolrooms last year," said Sylva, "and
there Is no legitimate reason to suppose
they have changed their minds so quickly
as many think they have. We have
finally determined to hold no election, but
go ahead and license the rooms this year
the same as last."
Another radical departure has also been
determined upon. Last year the whole
Board of Trustees, composed of Sylva,
Thomas and Ambjornsenâ Dickinson and
Crumpton proving mere ornaments so far
as the passage of an ordinance is con
cernedâdecided that three poolrooms
would be too many and it went at that.
The wires of Broyer, Glynn & Hum
phrey's establishment were cut and there
was a merry row all around, but the lit
tle boss of Marin had hiÃ way, as he al
ways does In Sausalito. Now a change
has for some reason or other come o'er
the spirit of the trio's dream and three
ri.omf are to be licensed. Nobody knows
the reason why this change has been de
cided upon, but a peculiar fact is that
nine out of every ten will make the same
conjecture.
Harvey & Co., Humphrey & Co. and
Kingsley & Co. are the titles of the firms
that will hereafter sell pools on Eastern
races in Rausalito. So far as the will of
the populace is concerned, this move of
Sylva will he welcomed. Their i'lr-a is,
the more the merrier, but there are a few
who are opposed to the chanK*\ among
them being Billy" McMillan and "John
ny" Peters, two saloon-keepers, who have
a minority report io make. But their op
position cuts no figureâ there will be three
poolrooms just thp same. Sylva has so
decreed, and his two satellites can be de
pendpd on to stand firm.

FABIOLA SAID

San Francisco's Good
Example.
OAKLAND WILL IGNORE IT
MINISTERS WILL OPEN FIRE TO
MORROW NIGHT.
Lady Managers Who Voted Against
the Acceptance of T. H. Wil
liams' Offer Are Highly
Commended.
Oakland Office Snn Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, April 26.
The Alameda County ministers have
prepared a statement to be submitted at
the regular prayer meetings on Wednes
day evening, expressing their regret that
Oakland should take up with and en
dburage an evil that even t^un Francisco
has dispensed with.
The protest is as follows:
We, the pastors and churches of
Alameda County desire to enter our
respectful but emphatic protest
against the receni action "f those di
rectors of the Fabiola Hospital who
voted to accept the proceeds of the
so-called Derby day at the Emery
ville racetrack, and against their an
nounced determination to make this a
"gala day" and a "society occasion,"
thus countenancing this gigantic Â«-vil
and encouraging and aiding an insti
tution which is damaging to the busi
ness and moral interests of our com
munity.
We further desire to express our
appreciation of me noble stand taken
by those other directors of Fabiola
who made the earnest, endeavor to
prevent this Derby day, but who were
defeated by a vote of 20 to 13
This recent action of the Kahiola di
rectors in their affiliation with a
gambling institution is more deplora
ble in the light of the recent action of
the city government of San Francisco
in banishing pool rooms, and the vig
orous efforts of our Oakland city offi
cials against all forms of gambling.
We should teach our people to glad
ly share their substance for the relief
of the unfortunate rather than that
our charities art- to be supported by
connivance with gambling institutions

Nearly all of the ministers of this city
will deliver short, aoaresses to-morrow
evening, condemning the racetrack its
influence and its alleged charity toward
Fabiola Hospital. An effort has been
made to obtain the names of the ladles
who voted for and against the accept
ance of T. H. Williams' offer, but so far
without success.
At the meeting when the ladies reached
a decision there were twenty in favor of
Derby day and thirteen opposed to it

promised JlflOO donation if Pabiola day be
dispensed with. Among those who fa
vored the day were Mrs. President Vu!.-

Dismissed by Stipulation.
The suit of the Mutual Electric Light
Company against Mayor Phelan and the
Board of Supervisors, wherein the com
pany sought to compel the board to grant
it permission to erect poles outside the
fire limits, was dismissed yesterday by
stipulation. The dismissal "of the suit is
the result of the board's action in grant
ing the covetfd privilege.

CAPTAIN EDGAR
WILL NOT BE A
PRISON DIRECTOR
San Quentin Official
in Hard Luck.
BIRLEM FINALLY TRIUMPHS
RAY WILL STILL REMAIN ON
THE PRISON BOARD.
Harbor Commissioner Kilburn Said
to Have Interceded With Gov
ernor Gage in Behalf
of His Friend.
The desire of J. C. Edgar, captain of
the yard at San Quentin Prison, t
cure a position on th^ Board of State
Prison Directors 1? doomed to disappoint
ment. So declares Governor Gage, the
political mouthpiece of a well known
Mexican colonel.
For some time it has boon known that
Edgar was greatly desirous of obtaining
a position en ihe board, but his reason
was noi bo clearly understood. Edgar is a
wt.iithy man and has frequently In the
past asserted his Intention to resign the
â¢ ares of active life and "take things
easy" for th.--r.st of his natural exist
ence. But finally the reason leaked out,
and then the omnipresent "Knocker" got
in his d< adly work.
Is Beems that tor many moons Captain
Edgar and Captain of the Guard Hirl<-m
have 1 1 â¢> t been on speaking terms, except
as regards their official duties. 1 â  those
who hv acquainted with the circum
stances Edgar ts commonly held to be in
thi v-i. ng. However, he is credited with
a r>eliet thai a position on the board would
give him a chance to make things Intpr
esting for Birlera. Then ram.' the obsta
cle.
Captain Birlem is said to occupy.his po
sition Âii aecou.nl of the friendship of
Paris Kilburn, now Harbor Commissioner.
W'hon Killmrn learned how things were
going he is asserted to have Interceded
with Governor Gage in behalf of his
friend.
I>"tia!<l Ray, thf director at San Quentin
pi sltion was for a time in jeopardy,
finally reached the conclusion that he was
an Aguirre man, and that was all Gage
win, :â â ',. go I :^a as hp would have no
trouble with R.iy he could remain on the
board. Thai disposed of Edgar's chance,
and now there is rejoicing on one sidi
a mark, d feeling of sorem ss on the other.

RECITAL BY
ROSENTHAL
After an absence of several months,
Morltz Rosenthal returned to San Fran
cisco and played yesterday afternoon in
the Grand Opera-house. His programme
was an excellent one and his playing was
quite as sensationally obstacle-proof as
it was at the previous performance, but
the audience was notably small, in spite \
of the low prices. A good-sized audience j
Is half the success of a concert, and It i
seems a pity so few of our musical towns- !
folk should have turned out to greet an j
artist of Rosenthal's importance.
His playing needs no new description. !
From a technical standpoint . he is the
wonder of the age, and he has a fine mu
sicianly mind that asserts itself in every- !
thing that he approaches. That !â <â â  has
not the ideal temperament, the human
throb, is perhaps to be regretted," but it j
is not a newsy regret at this time of day.
We must accept Rosenthal's tempera
mental limitations in much the same j
spirit that we accept those of Henry j
Irving. Both are great technical artists,
and have done something for the develop
ment of their. crafts. ;.-;:;
Rosenthal's most distinguished work
yesterday was in Beethoven's "Appas- I
sionata" sonata, which he played with j
rich, sonorous tone and authoritative an- !
alysis. . The rest of the programme dis- j
played the artist in a variety of moods \
and aroused the genuine enthusiasm of 'â 
those present.
In the same theater he will play this !
afternoon the following programme:
