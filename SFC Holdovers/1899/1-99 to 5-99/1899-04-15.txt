PRINCE HENRY
TO BE A KING
Talk of Setting Up a Ger
man Monarchy on Chi
nese Soil.
fICTORIA, B. C, April According to the
Peking and Tientsin Times, copies of which
vjiwere received here by the steamerGlenogle, it is
' generally believed among the foreign element at
Peking that the seizure of Kiaochau in Novem
ber, 1897, by Germany was a first step toward
I the realization of a scheme of Kaiser Wilhelm to
place a German King on Chinese soil.
Prince Henry, the Emperor's brother, who
is in the Orient in charge of the German Asiatic squadron, it is
believed, will be the King and the Chinese province of Shantung
his kingdom. The occupation of the interior of the province, it
is pointed out, is a direct move toward the establishment of
German sovereignty over the whole of the 65.000 square miles of
Shantung, instead of the 400 square miles around Kiaochau,
which was gouged out of the Chinese domain by Admiral Yon
Diederichs after the native mob had killed Missionaries Neise,
I Jennie and Zeigler.
Baron yon Heiking, the German Minister here, although he
is lid to have received a leave of absence because of ill health,
has not seen fit yet to claim his furlough. He left Peking for
Kiaochau, where he will consult with Prince Henry. The Ger
man expedition, which was sent last week into Southern Shan
tung to quell the anti-foreign disturbances there, has occupied Ji-
Chou, fifty-four miles from I-Chou-Fou. the original objective
point, without opposition. Chinese military officials in Shan
tung are confident that they will annihilate the foreigners, and,
it is understood, have asked permission from the Peking Gov
ernment to proceed against the force of occupation. This per
mission, however, will probably be denied.

MANILA, April 14. â For several days
past there has been extraordinary ac
tivity on the part of the native popu
lation of the city, and fears of an up
rising are entertained. Strict enforce
ment of the 7 o'clock order requiring all
persons not having written permission
to be abroad to retire to their homes
has been enjoined. It is known that
a number of Aguinaido's officers have
been in the city during the week, and
it is believed they have been endeavor
ing to arouse the natives to revolt. In
structions have been given to prevent
all gatherings in the native quarters at
any time of the day or night. More
troops are needed here. If the Ameri
cans expect to hold the towns captured
they will have to be occupied. At pres

DICK CROKER ADMITS
SHARING THE SPOILS
NEW TORK, April Richard
Croker was on the stand to-day
before the Mazet investigating
commission, and he will be on
the stand again to-morrow.
John F. Carroll, the Tammany leader's",
chief deputy, was also put through a
course of questioning this afternoon.
Judge Joseph E. Daly, whom the
Democrats refused to renominate for
Justice of the Supreme Court last fall,
told of his treatment by Mr. Crokqr and
Tammany, with other prominent wit
nesses, contributed testimony that
went to make the day a most notable
one in the investigation into the city's
affairs.
The examination of Richard Croker
was a remarkable one, chiefly by rea
son of the answers which he returned
to the questions propounded to him by
Mr. Moss. He was brief and took ad
vantage of many opportunities afforded
him to retort in a manner that evoked
applause many time's from those gath
ered in ie committee room.
Mr. Croker gave events a somewhat
k dramatic turn when, after refusing to
answer several questions concerning
his private affairs, he held up his right
hand and said impressively: "If you
can show me where I have taken a
single dollar from this city you can
cut that arm off."
When the Tammany chief went on
the stand at the beginning of the day's
session Mr. Moss conducted a line of
questioning which Mr. Croker evi
dently believed was a loss of time for
he suddenly leaned forward and said:
"It is not necessary to bring up what
everybody knows. There is no use
playing to the galleries; there is no
use making speeches. I am the leader
of the party, and I acknowledge it. All
these people are my friends and I am
going to stick to them all the tin- .-.â¢.
Just give me straight talk. lam going
to give you straight talk.
______ Moss said he would aceommoaace
him and he endeavored to do so. He
drew from Mr. Croker the fact that the
Tammany chief believed that all the
offices of administration of all depart
ments should go to the victorious po
litical party. "To the victors belong
the spoils," he added.
Continuing, Mr. Croker said that
when the Democrats placed men in of
fice the porty expected to have those
men do what the leaders of the party
asked them to do. He himself had
recommended the appointment of vari
ous officials and the distribution of pa
tronage. Not in every , case, however,
he said, had his advice been carried
out. He admitted, nevertheless, that
he had a considerable amount of po-
I litical influence.

SEATTLE, Wash., April 14.â A land
slide, terrible in its effects, occurred on
the Great Northern railroad this after
noon near Wellington. A half dozen or
more of people were injured, several
fatally. About 1 o'clock the rotaries
used by the Great Northern in the
mountains left Wellington for Madison
to clear the track for a Great Northern

Some distance outside of Wellington
a vast avalanche swept down the
mountain side, carrying rotaries and

REVOLUTION IN THE
MATTO GROSSO PROVINCE
Defeated Candidate for Governor
Heads a Movement to Overthrow
Antonio Luiz.
Special Cable to The Call and the New York
Herald. Copyrighted, 1899, by James Gor
don Bennett.
BUENOS AYRES, April 14.â The Her
ald's correspondent at Montevideo tele
graphs that a message from the frontier
has been received announcing that a rev
olutionary uprising has taken place in the
province of Matto Grosso, Brazil, against
the newly elected Governor, Antonio Luiz.
RICHARD CROKER,
Tammany's Chief
A matter that Mr. Moss gave attention
to was Mr. Crocker's connection with the
auctioneering business conducted by Pe
ter I-'. Meyer, by whom the majority of
the judicial sales were conducted.
Mr. Croker said he had been a member
of the firm for some years, and as a true
Democrat he expected to be befriended
in the way of profit from the sales.
"Then you are working for your pock
et?" said Mr. Moss.
"All the time, the same as you are,"
retorted the witness. .-"** â¢
"To. the boss belongs the lion's share of
the plunder," sneered Mr. Moss,
"No plunder, no," said Mr. Croker.
"You can call it what you like. You may
call the bill you send to the Legislature
for the work you are now doing plunder,
'f you please."
There was loud applause at this and
Mr. Mazet said he would clear the hall if
the applause occurred again, but Mr.
Moss said he rather liked the applause.
Mr. Croker told the committee that it
was customary for candidates in office to
contribute to election expenses, and stat
ed, also that contributions had been as
high as (8000 or $10,000. He said that the
contributions were not compulsory, but
were in many cases, on the contrary, vol
untary. v
Perhaps the most interesting part of the
investigation . to-day was that in which
Mr. Croker was questioned closely as to
how he had made his money. Mr. Croker
refused to tell of his private affairs, but
admitted that he was a member of sever
al companies, one of which is the Air and
Power Company, with a capital . stock of
$10,000,000. He said: .
"I've got : nothing to conceal. If any
one comes to me with a good stock to
buy I buy it, and so would you, I will not

NEW YORK, April 14.â The Washington
correspondent of the Herald telegraphs:
As a result of the decision of the Presi
dent to transfer Bellamy Storrer to Ma
drid as Minister of the United States. I
understand that the President has under
consideration the advisability of assign
ing Lawrence Townsend to the Belgian
mission. ... ,_â¢ _,
An official who has talked with the
President regarding the Belgian mission
told me to-day that friends of Minister
Townsend. who is accredited to Portugal,
have been strongly pressing him for Spain.
The decision of the President in favor of
Mr. Storrer left a vacancy in Belgium,
and the President, as a mark of his ap
preciation of Mr. Townscnd's worth, has
offered him the succession to Mr. Storrer.
Should he accept it. the President will
make a new appointment to Portugal.
go into any details' of my private busi
ness." '*-' t> - L ; â¢"â¢â¢.-
Mr. Moss endeavored in a persuasive
way to Induce -Mr. Croker to give tur
ther information on the subject of money
making, but the witness .simply refused
to give details.
Incidentally Mr. Croker praised Chief
Devery and the ' police department and
was on the stand when the hearing ad
journed.
Former Judge Joseph F. Daly, who was
called during the course of the afternoon,
said that he had been notified in the early
pari of last year that be need. not expect
a renomination. This notification came
directly from Mr. Croker, and it was, he
said, the result of ids refusing to appoint
a chief clerk of the Court of . Common
Pleas recommended by Croker and be
cause he had refused to make a judicial
order for the removal of the legal Bales to
111 Broadway, where Peter F. Meyers'
firm is located. '
With -reference to the statements made
during the recent election that Judge Daly
had been originally discovered by "Boss"
Tweed and by him nominated for his |
first judgeship, he denied that he had ever
known Tweed or that he had been selected !
by Tweed. Judge Daly said that he had
paid $7000 in assessments for his two nor- 'â 
inations by Tammany Hall.
Former Judge Roger A. Pryor, who fol
lowed Judge Daly, testified that he, too,
had contributed to Tammany on account
of his nomination, he having sent a check
for $10,000, payable to the order of Richard
Croker, chairman of the finance commit
tee of Tammany Hall. This check was
returned to him the next day and he was
asked to make the check payable to the
bearer. . This he did. . . > -; v
Another interesting witness was John
F. Carroll, Mr. Croker's chief lieutenant.
Mr. Carroll did not prove a very easy wit
ness, and because of his refusal to answer
questions Mr. Moss suggested that he
might have to have Carroll sent to jail
for contempt of court. Later he asked
that Mr. Carroll's refusal to answer ques
tions be reported to the Legislature. The
cause of all this was the question as to
whether Mr. Carroll had any connection
with the Consolidated Ice Company, or
whether he had any stock therein. It
developed during the examination that
Mr. Carroll had given up a $7500 position
to accept his present position in Tam
many Hall, which theoretically Is without
salary.
Mr. Moss pointed out that therefore Mr.
Carroll was without visible means of sup
port and was therefore a pauper. Wit
ness, however, denied this, while at the
same time, he denied that he was receiv
ing a salary from Mr. Croker or from
Tammany Hall or from anybody that the
counsel could name.
It was during the course of this exami
nation that Committeeman Hoffman made
a protest on the line of questions. He
demanded that all the witnesses be treat
ed fairly and that questions be fairly put.
Mr. Moss, however, continued to direct
his efforts to settle the question- in the
same manner as he had begun. He ended
his efforts in this direction by asking:
"Dare you tell of the.' money you â¢ have
received in the last thirty days to
which : Mr. Carroll replied: "I decline to
answer such questions. You can't frigten
me."
Mr. Carroll made the* admission that
''what Mr. Croker says goes." And ac
cording to him,, also, it goes with every
body connected with ' Tammany Hall or
holding his office through the good wishes
of that organization.

NEW YORK, April 14.â The Wash
ington correspondent of the Herald tel-
egraphs: Secretary Hay read to the
Cabinet to-day the instructions to the
American representatives to the pro
posed disarmament conference and
they will be delivered '-. to Mr. Hollis.
secretary of the delegation, to-morrow
or Monday.
Officials are keeping the instructions
a close secret, especially that feature
relating to international arbitration,
which the American delegates will
strongly favor. While the administra
tion relies fully upon the judgment of
the Commissioners, I understand that
they are instructed not to agree to any
important proposition without first re
ferring it to Washington for considera
tion and determination by the Presi
dent. The attitude of this Government
on the disarmament proposition of the
Czar has been already explained by the
Herald. This Government has no con
cern in the armaments of the nations
of the world and will certainly not
agree to prohibit the invention of mere
deadly weapons of warfare. The
American representatives are especial
ly directed to pay attention to the in
ternational arbitration phase of the ne
gotiations, and every effort will be
made to obtain an agreement of this
kind which may be satisfactory t Â» all
nations taking part in the conference.
President Low has notified the [State
Department that he will sail from New
York on the steamer leaving May 9.
The American Commissioners will hold
a meeting immediately upon the arri
val of all the members, and decide upon
their line of procedure. They will
reach The Hague a few days before the
18th of May, the day upon which the
conference will assemble.

REFUSES TO RESIGN
Intends to Guide the War Depart

for Contingencies Arise.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Gall Headquarters, Wellington Hotel,
Washington, April 14.
Secretary Alger to-night made a posi
tive, and unequivocal statement that
the reports that he intends to retire
from the Cabinet are absolutely with
out foundation, and that unless some
unforeseen and unlooked-for contin
gency arises he proposes to remain
Secretary of War throughout this ad
ministration.
j Mr. Alger had his attention called to
recent rumors that he would resign
after the close of the investigation into
the conduct of the war and incident
matters, and that his successor already
had been determined upon. He said
all statements of that character were
false; that he had not entertained such
intention and they were instigated with
the evident purpose of forcing him to
leave the Cabinet. He said he proposed
to pay no attention whatever to these
attacks.
Mr. Alger authorized the Associated
Press to make an absolute denial of the
reports. of his contemplated resignation
and to announce once for all in the
strongest terms possible that he would
retain his present position throughout
his regular term, of office. Of course,
he added, if there should be a great
disaster in his private business affairs
or he should be stricken in health or
some such wholly unexpected and sud
den event occurred it might actuate
him to resume private life as a matter
of course, but he had not had any idea
of resigning and his determination to
remain, despite reports to the contrary,
was fixed and unalterable.

YON BULOW EXPLAINS
During Interpellation in Reichstag
the Foreign Minister Pleads
for Amicable Adjustment.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
BERLIN, April 14.â The Minister of
Foreign Affairs, Baron yon Bulow, an
nounced in the Reichstag that an
agreement had been arrived at with
Great Britain with regard to sending
a commission to Samoa.
The Interpellation on Samoa was pre
sented by Dr. Lehr, an Extremist, and
was replied to by the Minister of For
eign Affairs, Baron yon Bulow.
There was a slim attendance of mem
bers in the Reichstag to-day, but the gal
leries were crowded. The United States
Embassy was represented at the session.
The opening speech of the interpella
tion to which the Minister of Foreign Af
fairs had previously agreed to reply was
not a success, and it was afterward said
that the signers of the interpellation
blundered in intrusting its presentation
to Dr. l.ehr. The latter, contrary to
agreement, made strong references to
economic matters in arguing against the
American and British attitude in Samoa,
hinting that Germany would fight both
countries economically if thwarted politi
cally. The party leaders, one after an
other, repudiated Dr. Lehr's declarations.
In substance the interpellation, which
was signed by a majority of the Center,
Reichs party. Conservatives and National
Liberals, asked for information regarding
the events in Samoa and also requested
information regarding the measures taken
or to be taken by the Government under
the circumstances.
The Foreign Minister in his reply em
phasized Germany's adherence to the Sa
moan act, the rearrangement of which he
claimed was desirable to the Government.
Continuing the Minister said the Govern
ment knew nothing of the conflicts said to
have taken place between the American
admiral. Kautz, and the commander of
the German warship Falke.
In the course of his remarks the Min
ister said:
"I am quite prepared to express my
views of an affair which, with Justice, is
keenly occupying opinion and has been
for weeks the subject of serious attention
upon the part of the Government. On
I the other hand, you will understand that
j in my official responsible position I shall
not say things that may render a peace*
| ful settlement of the difficulties ques-
I tionable.
"Regarding the history of the compli
cations in Samoa, I have made a state
ment to the budget committee and have
particularly pointed out how, since the
coming into force of the act. disturbances
and frictions between the representatives
of the powers have not been lacking.
"Our attitude regarding the complica
tion may be summed up in a single sen
tence. 'Adherence to the legal status cre
ated by the act so long as the act is not
modified by the unanimous decision of
the powers.' That is to say, respect for
the rights appertaining to others by vir
tue of the act, but at the same time full
maintenance of German rights. In the
Interests of the tranquillity of Samoa and
in the interest of calmer relations be
tween the powers should they find it ad
vantageous, if the act has become inad
equate, it could be replaced by a fresh
arrangement, corresponding better with
the present situation. With this idea I
said in the budget committee that we
were disposed to consent to a clean sep
aration. As, however, the disadvantages
of the situation were felt by both the
other powers, equally with ourselves, we
have no occasion and no need to maks
special proposals of our own initiative.
But, so long as the Samoa agreement ex
ists, it must be loyally observed by all
concerned. The letter and spirit of the
act require that final decision be only
effected by the unanimous resolutions of
the three governments. % We therefore
have allowed no doubt to remain in Lon
don and Washington that we must re
gard as not legally binding any changes
to which we have not given our assent.
We could not permit a decision regard
ing Samoa to be taken contrary to the
treaty rights and without or even against
us.
"This principle of unnecessary unanim
ity which is set up and defended by us
was accomplished by America and "then
also by Great Britain. Another leading
point of view is for us to hold aloof from
the disputes of the native chiefs. We
were confronted by several candidates for
the throne of Samoa, but we have not
taken sides. But the provisional govern
ment of Mataafa having been recognized
by the three Consuls, it must have ap
peared to our Consul as the legal status
quo until a new government was Installed
by the unanimous resolution of the three
Governments. t.-;.' j
"For the reason that wo have taken up
a neutral attitude in regard to the inter
nal affairs of Samoa we have neither par
ticipated in nor approved the interven
tion of British and American warships
in these disputes.
"Respecting the recent conflicts we
have only mutilated and defective tele
grams from our Consul and more or less
trustworthy reports from foreign tele
graphic agencies, so that it is not yet
possible for us to pass final judgment
on the affair. '
"Nothing is known to us, however, con
cerning the reported conflict between the
American admiral and the commander of
the Falke.
"I agree with the Secretary of the Navy
that the report of such a conflict is en
tirely unfounded, and I am convinced that
the conduct, sense, honor, tact and self
control of our naval officers were beyond
praise, .as was the discipline of the men.
"Regarding the German subject arrested
in Samoa, he was evidently the director
of the plantation at Vailele. near Huff
nagel. We immediately called the serious
attention of the British Government to
the matter and expressed our confident
expectation that no harm would come
to our countryman if. as we certainly be
lieved, he is innocent.
"The final settlement cannot be preju
diced by the events in Samoa. This set
tlement will not take place on the spot.
It can only be the result of an agreement
between the three Cabinets. In order to
bring about such a readjustment we
have proposed to dispatch a special com
mission, have demanded unanimity in its
decisions and have carried this point af
ter overcoming considerable difficulties.
(Cheers.)
"I am happy to state that the British
Government has now officially declared to
me, through its Embassador, that it ac
cepted the proposals of Germany regard
ing the mode of operation and functions
of the commission, whose functions and
powers may be summed up as follows:
"The commission appointed by . ie three
signatory powers to the Samoa act will
take over the provisional government of
the islands. To this end the commission
will exercise the highest powers. All
other official personages will have to obey
the orders of the Commissioners, and the
three powers will instruct their consular
and naval representatives to lend their
support. No measures taken by the
Commissioners in conformity with the
foregoing official powers will be legal
unless all three Commissioners assent
thereto. '
"One of the tasks of the commission2
will be to consider what provisions It re
tards as necessary for the future govern
ment of the country, or the modification
Â»f the Berlin act. and report to the Gov
ernment the views at which It finally ar
rives.
"We hope the commission will succeed
,n" effecting a settlement, just, fair and
acceptable to all parties. We will only
af-ent to such decisions as do not pre
lildiee our plain rights and the important
interests oi Germans in Samoa.
"A portion of the foreign press has
-ailed attention to the fact that the value
of Samoa Is not in proportion to the
importance trained in international poli
tics and relations. "We. too, believe that
t will be in the highest degree reprehen
sible if war were kindled by the three
ereat civilized Christian nations, on ac
-sount of a group of islands in the remote
South Sea. inhabited by thirty thousand
savages, among whom live scarcely five
hundred Europeans, with a total trade
ot hardly three million marks. I am con
vinced of and advised that it should not
be forgotten that in foreign policy it is of
the first importance not to allow one a
right judgment to be prejudiced, hut to
appraise every question according to its
real importance.
"Two things, however, must not be for
gotten. Firstly, our duty to protect the
trade, business and property of our
.ountrvmen in Samoa. Secondly, we pos
sess treaty riuhts in Samoa, the mainte
nance of which are regarded by the Ger
man nation as a point of honor." (Cheers
and crieÃ of "Vhat's right-V)
The Minister of Foreign ' Affairs added:
"We demand in Samoa no more than
what belongs to us. by. treaty. But we

MOORS CONFINED TO
HIS BEACH HOUSE
A remarkable feature about the recent
troubles In Samoa was the unanimity
with which the English and American
citizens of Apia joined hands to oppose
.the Germans. It was a clearly defined
rational struggleâ Chief Justice Cham
bers, with the American and English Con
suls behind him, battlinÃ for the young
King Malietoa Tanu. while Herr Rose and
the German officials and citizens brought
all their influence to bear In support of
the ferocious chieftain Mataafa, Steven
son's old pet.
The only exception to this international
demarcation was H. J. Moors, one of the
largest American storekeepers on the
beach. Moors is well known In San Fran
cisco. He has visited this coast on sev
eral occasions, and once, i bout four years
ago, during the Tamasese trouble, went
on a political mission to Washington with
the view of setting the United States au
thorities straight on Samoan affairs.
Moors indirectly had a good deal to do
with the framing of the Berlin treaty and
hence his present attitude is all the more
inexplicable. He is a man of great ability
and large experience in island affairs.
Born in Detroit, he early made his way
in search of adventure to the
Pacific. There hi became engaged
ln the blackblrding trade on behalf of
the Goddefroy firm, which then held the
German plantations in Samoa. After sev
eral voyages Moors made enough money
to set up in business on his own account
on the beach, and for many yeara has
managed a large store, ln addition he
owns the lovely coral rock Spina â lands,
some 61)0 miles from Samo_, where he has
started a large cocoanut plantation. Dur
ing the last few years Moors has also
cleared and cultivated a large tract of
land at Papasoa, som_ three miles frorr
Apia. There, at considerable expense, h_
established a flourishing cocoa planta
tion, and it looked as if his new venture
was likely to prove a great success. Co
coa rives exceedingly ell In the flour
ishing climate of Samoa, and the last
shipment which Moors sent to San Fran
cisco was pronounced by the manufac
turers here to be the best in the market.
However, as the entire district has now
been ravaged by Mataafa's warriors,
Moors has probably l"St the whole fruits
of his labors. His house and plantation
have been destroyed and all that Is left
to him Is his store on the beach, where,
when the last mall left, he was confined,
practically a prisoner, by the American
sentries.
Moors explains his peculiar attitude over
this affair in a letter to James R. Wat
son, his agent in this city. Writing on
March 23 Moors says:
"Three days after the arrival of the Phil
adelphia I called 'on Admiral Kautz and
Captain Whltuy. being nicely received by
both. The admiral told me that I was in
a painful minority on this question, and
unless 1 was careful I might get Into seri
ous trouble. 1 told the admiral that on
the contrary I was on the side of the ma
jority and that Ij.expressed the sentiments
of three-fourths of the foreign and 'JO per
cent of the native population.
"Later on the admiral sent me a copy
of the proclamation issued by the English
and American Consuls In favor of Malie
toa. 1 thought well of it and sent word
to Mataafa to obey. But when Mataafa
was addressing his people and. advising
them to respect the pro( tarnation word
came that Maxse. the British Consul, had
commenced to arm the returned tlietoa
prisoners Just brought back from Tutulla.
This news caused great indignation among
the fighting men. the meeting broke up
in anger and Mataafa's people, at once
commenced hostilities.
"I have not heard yet of a single native
who has deserted Mataafa for Malietoa.
Most of the whites and Malietoa' s native
adherents are confined on the Mulinuu
peninsula . and as soon as they have eaten
up the little food close to the beach in
Apia they will be in a* serious fix. On
Mulinuu there is neither food, water nor
firewood. No one told me to stay at home,
but I coll' hide.; to do so when the trouble
began. It was just as well, for I learned
that the guards placed In front of ray
house had orders to stop me at once If I
tried to leave and to shoot me if I did not
obey. I have been now ten days in my
house, having very little communication
with the outside world. I understand that
the Germans are likewise confined, and
are no better off than I am. The guards
are civil ar.d obliging.
"As to the native â¢war. it will require at
least 10,000 troops with all equipments and
accessories to subjugate the Samoans.
Even then â a great loss must be counted
en from exposure and warlike casualties.
The Samoans are not wards; they are
fighting in a good cause, and God knows
1 hope their sterling qualities will soon be
recognized and appreciated.".

PURPLE AND GOLD
FLAG UNFURLED
Very Impressive Rites on
Point Loma.
BY MRS. H. H. SOMi-RS.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN DIEGO. April 14.â Radiant sun
shine flooded Point. Loma Thursday after
noon, bringing into 'brilliant display a
multitude of flags of many nations decor
ating the amphitheater on the picturesque
heights. Their vari-colored folds, quiver
ing in a freshening breeze, gave a vivid
touch of life to the occasion.-
Hundreds of representatives were pres
ent at 3:30 o'clock, when the exercises
were begun by seven clear, distinct trum
pet blasts and the raising of the purple
and gold flag of the School for the Re
vival of the Lost Mysteries .if Antiquity.
As It reached the top of the tall staff
fanfares of trumpets from the towers on
the heights proclaimed "Universal Broth
erhood" to the four parts of the earth.
This Indicated that old lifeless forms were
to be modified, if not entirely discarded,
and aroused quite a feeling of expec
tancy as to what would follow. Just as
the vibration of the last trumpet tone
was moving out into the atmosphere, a
deep-voiced Intonation was beard from
behind the trees, in the solemn declara
tion: "Nothing is great, nothing is small
in the divine economy"; then followed the
powerful, sublime invocation commanding
"Truth, light and liberation."
This was repeated in greater volume
from what seemed to be tne same source
and was chanted in the same spirit by-
Mime of the students in the audience.
Then came "As is the outer, so is the in- j
ncr; as Is the great, so Is the small."
"Truth, light and liberation" were again
invoked, coming to the audience through
the same stages and thence again taken
up and repeated as before. With the ad- j
ditional power of .growing confidence is ;
then given from the source again: "He
that worketb is one"; "There is but one |
eternal law." The Intonation closed with !
"Truth, light and liberation," even more !
impressive than before. The effect was ;
Inspiriting beyond description and new, it j
Is said, even to the members of the broth- |
erhood. One who was not present can
not realize the feeling aroused.
As the soul-stirring music passed into ,
silence Katherine H. Tingley and the j
Cabinet of Universal Brotherhood came
In and took seats in front of the scenic \
construction built for the Greek play, !
"Emenides." International representa- j
tives were . received and officially taken
into the body of the congress in silence. j
This ceremony, though so simple, was far
more impressive than the wordy proceed- j
ings grnerall used upon like occasions |
elsewhere.
Dr. Jerome A. Anderson gave the ad- j
dress of welcome, a few of the interesting j
points being as follows:
Humanity's cry Is for truth, light and liber- j
ation, and so. gathering from the four corners .
of the earth, as new Knights of the Holy Grail.
those who have forsworn selfishness and taken
the vow of humanity have met here to pay
homage. Here is the lion-hearted Helen Jila- !
vatsky, "the greatest of the exiles," with
Judge, whose life work is present now as an
Inspiration, and K. A. Tingley, the savior of j
the movement.
After this came a rising of delegates as j
a salutation to Mrs. Tingley, the leader
and official head.
Mrs. Elizabeth Mayer, superintendent of |
the children's work, made an impressive I
talk. Among other things she said:
The moet of us realize that the modern edu
cational system Is not what it should be; that I
while the Intellect of nineteen centuries \a a
beautiful flower, it if like the artificial product
of the greenhouse. While our colleges turn out |
well-trained minds, we realize that our youth
have a vein of pessimism, no matter how tal
ented or accomplished they may be. â  That pes
simism Is blighting cur modern humanity, and
I believe it comes from the starvation of the
Â»'.ul. Going through these years of stud., we
are simply -gorging the brain-mind and leav
ing the heart cold. We, who understand these
vital truth., knew there must be a change and i
under our leader, K. A.' Tingley, we have es
tablished centers all over the world where '
children are taken and being educated on the I
broadest lines of universal brotherhood, and
motherless and destitute children are being :
prepared as teachers and helpers of humanity. ]
Think what that means to the unborn races.
If we bring these- truths to the coming gener
ation, It will awaken knowledge of the past ,
which Is the heritage of all of us. From now |
on, woman must play a great part In future. i
From what she makes her own she gives to the \
child. 1 wish to express here to-day my grati
tude to Katherine A. Tingley, whom every I
woman must recognize as the highest type of
womanhood as well as a leader and teacher.
May we follow where she leads.
Following Mrs. Mayer was A. E.
Smythe of Toronto, Canada. He said:
We are gathered here to celebrate an anni
versary, but we celebrate more than that.
Napoleon looked on the pyramids and said that j
' 5000 centuries looked down upon them. To-day j
the eternal ages look down upon us. All that i
has ever been, all that has come together in '
the ages that have preceded us. have gathered
Into one focus. We are the center of It all. j
The world is a point in space, and we are the j
nucleus of that world; it is with us that the '
future of humanity rests. It is difficult for i
those who have not thought and entered into j
themselves and gathered the philosophy of the
past into their minds to realize their relation
to others and the universe. Some of us who i
have thought and studied have felt that the I
children's motto of helping and sharing is one
that we must carry out In our own lives.
' What we want Is- something universal that
can enter Into every day of the week, that all
men, women and children can have to carry in i
their lives, their schools, their business, their
homes. aye. Into their chamber when
death comes, and rest there in peace. We ex
clude no one; we simply ask you to recognize
that you are friends. Let us understand that
this universal brotherhood is not any of the |
things that take us away from the sensible, j
ordinary lives of the great mass of humanity. |
!_et us try to understand that this philosophy
la one of sanctified common sense. It Is not ;
In metaphysical profundity, but simply In the !
plain doing of duty and*the relief of suffering I
and entering into the hearts of those around
us.
Following Mr. Smythe's address there
was music behind the scenes, which
Closed the first session of the second Uni
versal Brotherhood Congress.
The next public meeting will be held
on Sunday afternoon, when a musical will
be given under the direction of Mrs. Basil
Crump and Mrs. Alice L. '"leather, mem
bers of the Wagner School in London.
The rededication of the site for the
School for the Revival of the Lost Mys- i
teries of Antiquity occurred at midnight. !
The ceremony was performed from first
to last In silence, with the exception of :
the Invocation to "Truth, light and liber- ;
ation," chanted at various stages of the ;
proceedings. Those taking - active part ;
were robed In garments of pure white i
and bore lighted candles throughout the
entire time. The specific form of the act
ual rededication was similar to the origi
nal dedication which occurred about two
years ago, when the brotherhood crusade
around the world, led by Katherine A.
Tingley, /the foundress of the school, re- â 
turned to this country.

graphs: Orders were cabled to-day by
Secretary Long to Rear Admiral Samp
son directing him to relieve the cruiser
Newark from duty with, his squadron,
and to order her to proceed at once to
the Pacific station.
The Newark arrived to-day at Barba
does, and her prompt dispatch to the Pa
cific, while apparently in pursuance of in
structions given on January 21 last, is
really due to the developments In File Sa
moan controversy. I also understand
that the Navy Department proposes to
take immediate measures for placing the
reconstructed steamer. Ranger in. com
mission, so that the United States will in
a month have a fairly good force In Pa
cific waters. The Newark will stop at
South American ports, so as to be ready
to proceed to Samoa without delay in
case Rear Admiral Kautz considers her
presence at Apia necessary.

CANNOT MUSTER
OUT VOLUNTEERS
South Dakota Troops
Are Needed.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Headquarters, Wellington Hotel,
Washington, April 14.
The War Department will notify Gov
ernor Lee of South Dakota that all
volunteer troops in the Philippines will
be brought home as soon as deemed ex
pedient by the military authorities on
the spot, and as rapidly as the force of
transports will permit. It is not likely
that his demand for the .immediate
muster out of the South Dakota regi
ment will be complied with, but there
is no doubt that all individual soldiers
of that command who insist upon their
discharge will be mustered out and
sent home on the first available trans
port.
It is maintained at the War Depart
ment that the statute regulating the
muster out of volunteer troops at the
close of the Spanish war contemplated
that the executive department should
have ample time in which to arrange
for the discharge and transportation
home of the troops. That is a work
of considerable magnitude and requires
time. The experience of the Civil War
in this respect is recalled to show that
several months and in some cases more
than a year were consumed in demob
ilizing the army.
The provisions in the Hull bill al
lowing volunteers in the Philippines to
be enlisted for six months may be con
strued that volunteers need not be
mustered out at this time if their ser
vices are absolutely necessary to the
Government.
It is admitted in official circles, how
ever, that this contention is hardly ten
able in the case of troops who insist on
being mustered out. Chairman Hull
stated on the floor of the House, when
asked if the six months' clause would
be construed to continue volunteers in
the Philippines if they wanted to come
home, that he had the assurance of the
administration that no such construc
tion would be made. The statute bear
ing on this subject is section 15 of the
act for increasing the efficiency of the
army, which provides: "The President
is authorized to enlist temporarily in
the service for absolutely necessary
purposes in the Philippine Islands vo.
unteers, officers and men, individually
or by organization, now in those islands
and about to be discharged, provided
their retention shall not extend beyond
the time necessary to replace them by
troops authorized to be maintained'un
der the provisions of this act and not
beyond a period of six months."
Nothing has been received from Gen
eral Otis on the subject since March 16,
but advices are expected from him
daily.
The officials of the War Department
are confident that General Otis will do
the best he can under the circum
stances, and that so far as possible he
will arrange for the return to the
United States of all volunteer troops
desiring to do so.
According to Secretary Alger's latest
Instructions, General Otis is vested
with plenary powers and may exercise
his discretion in the matter of the dis
charge of individual volunteers or or
ganizations. It is estimated that there
are about 18,000 volunteers in the Phil
ippines, and a reduction of the effective
force under General Otis at this time
to that extent is said to be entirely out
of the question.
The War Department is using every
endeavor to Induce volunteers to re
enlist in the regular army under in
provisions of the Hull bill. It has ar
ranged for an allowance of travel pay
amounting to between $500 and $600 in
each enlistment. It is confidently ex
pected that a great many of the. volun
teers will take advantage of this op
portunity and remain in the service.
CHURCH PROPERTY IN
THE PHILIPPINES
Archbishop Corrigan Has a Talk
With the President Upon
the Subject.
NEW YORK. April M.â A special to the
World from Washington says: The pres
ence of Archbishop Corrigan -of New
York in this city and his visit to the
White House has caused much comment
in church circles. It is understood that
Archbishop Corrigan consulted the Presi
dent regarding the future disposition of
church property in the Philippines. As it
seems assured that the United States will
hold the archipelago permanently the
members of the American church hav_
suggested to the Vatican that the vest
ing of this property in the American hier
archy would be a satisfactory solution.
Church officials her* have been informed
that Bourke Cochran of New York, who
is now, In Europe, will soon go to Rome
as Monsignor Corrigan's personal repre
sentative in the matter.

SEEK THE SOURCE
OF KLONDIKE COLD
Project of a Party of
Miners.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PORT TOWNSEND. April 14.â Word has
just been received through private sources
to the effect that an expedition is being
fitted out to prospect a heretofore unex
plored section of the great Northwest
Territory. This expedition will start from
Wrangel and will be composed of several
experienced and practical miners, who in
the early days of the gold excitement in
the Cassiar country were among the for
tunates and reaped a rich harvest.
The section of country to be prospected
is that portion lying west of the Rocky
Mountains at the headwaters of the Yu
kon and the eastern tributaries of that
river. It is from that region that the
gold found In the Yukon and its tributa
ries originally came. This theory is based
upon the belief that the Rocky Mountains
are the fountain-head of the gold run,
or, in other words, contain the mother
lode. The action of the elements for past
ages has scattered the gold on both sides
of the Rocky Mountains through British
North America, the United States and
Mexico. The rich deposits found along
the Klondike and its small tributaries
lead to the belief that the mother lode
Is somewhere in that vicinity. The head
waters of all those streams form in the
Rocky Mountains, which have not as yet
been prospected owing to that section be
ing practically impenetrable from the
Klondike.
This expedition will go from Wrangel
to Dease Lake, which is about 250 miles
from that place, in a northeasterly direc
tion In British Columbia, and thence will
proceed northeast over a comparatively
open country until the foothills of the
Rocky Mountains are reached. Then the
course will be along the west side of the
range. . prospecting all the streams,
gulches and benches to a point east and
north of the Klondike, thus taking in all
the streams which form the headwaters
of the Yukon, and down the channels of
which gold has been carried for ages and
deposited.
William G. Thomas, a pioneer of Alaska,
formerly a Deputy United States Marshal
and recently a customs officer, is one of
the promoters of this expedition and has
great faith in its outcome. He says that
in the early days of the Cassiar excite
ment two men penetrated a portion of the
country to be prospected and the sickness
of one of them caused their return to
Wrangel. They met success, bringing out
several hundred dollars in dust, most of
which was coarse gold and bore but little
Indications of having been carried a great
distance by water, as it was rough and
contained more or less quartz. They also
gave a glowing account of the country
as a prospecting field from a geological
standpoint. One of these men died at
Wrangel and the other left for the East,
Intending to return. He never made his
reappearance and it was surmised that
he either abandoned the project or met
a fate similar to that of his partner.
Since that time, according to the state
ments of Mr. Thomas, several expeditions
have been planned, but owing to the un

MRS. SPRING ENRAGED.
SAN JOSE, April 14.â Spring di
vorce case was up before Judge Lorigan
this morning on a motion that Mrs.
Emily Spring show cause why her $200 a
month alimony should not be stopped
because she had removed from Santa
Clara County. Mrs. Spring became an
gered at her husband's attorney, and at
one stage in the proceedings hurriedly
left the courtroom, after having de
nounced her husband and another witness
as perjurers. Attorney Schelter coaxed
her back into the courtroom and things
went along smoothly.
Mrs. Spring was the first witness. She
denied that she had been served with a
restraining order commanding her not to
remove the furniture from her house.
Martin Burns testified that he had served
the order on her in San Francisco. He
said Mrs. Spring refused to take the no
tice and he laid it on her arm. This was
the testimony that enraged Mrs. Spring.
Judge Lorigan continued the case for a
week. â 
WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY.
NEW YORK. April 14.â A special to the
World from Washington says: The first
thorough test here of the Marconi system
of wireless telegraphy was conducted to
day, under the supervision of Colonel
James Allen and Colonel George O Squier
of the Signal Corps. Communication was
established between the State. War and
Navy Departments building and the Na
val Observatory. The distance traveled
by the waves was more than a mile. No
attempt was made to send formal mes
sages, but words were flashed through
space, which demonstrated that messages
can be transmitted between two points
without the use of wires. ,

WOMEN REBUKE
GOVERNOR GAGE
Bitter Denunciation of
the Executive.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, April 14â Governor Gage
came in for a good roasting at the
hands of the woman suffragists of this
county to-day, and had he heard the
expressions regarding him his ears
would have tingled for some time to
come. The occasion was the annual
convention of the Equal Suffrage clubs
of Santa Clara County. Over 100 dele
gates representing all sections of the
county were present. Mrs. A. L. Cor
bett of Palo Alto presided.
Mrs. Sturtevant Peet. president of the
State Women's Christian Temperance
Union, bitterly denounced Gage. She
said the vetoing of the bill granting
the ballot to women in school elections
was all that could be expected of a
Governor who would leave his duties
at Sacramento to attend the horse races
at San Francisco. Miss Sarah Sever
ance and Mrs. A. A. Sargent of San
Francisco made similar speeches and
the latter regretted that Maguire had
not been elected, for he undoubtedly
favored equal suffrage.
The adoption of the following resolu
tions was cheered:
Whereas, We, the suffrage women of
: Santa Clara County, in convention as
; sembled, believe in the principle of equal
rights to all and special privileges to
none; whereas, many of us are paying
â¢ taxes; whereas, we bear and do our share
j in rearing men who become the soldiers
; and law-makers of the country; whereas.
,we assist in furnishing these soldiers.
'. and destroy none; whereas, women assist
, In restoring to health, home and useful-
I ness soldiers whom other men shoot
I down. and. when they cannot personally
do this, assist by various contributions;
whereas, we desire added respectability
j of citizenship; be it "-'.".-. ";:
Resolved, That we. suffrage women of
I Santa Clara County, in convention assem
bled, desire to express our supreme dis-
I appointment in Governor Gage of Cali
â¢ fornia as a man and an executive for his
pocket veto of the school suffrage bill
that was passed with only seven dissent
ing votes in the last Senate and Assem
bly; be it further
Resolved, As wives, mothers and human
beings we express our gratitude for the
men who stood for justice.

Junck, who, in a deposition, generally
backed M_ajor Lauth's evidence.
Captain Valdant deposed he heard

corresponded with the Italian attaches.
He gives the Embassador's explanation
of the famous cipher of November 2,
1894, of the Italian Government which
was misread by the French intelligence
department and used against Dreyfus.

NEEDED AT HIS POST.
VICTORIA. B. C, April 14.â According
to news brought by the Glenogle the
North China Daily News reported that in
view of the tension at Peking the leave
of the British and German Ministers. Sir
Claude Mac Donald and Baron yon Hei
king. had been stopped for the present.
On the following day the same journal
added: Nothing appears to be officially
known as yet of Sir Claude Mac Donald's
leave having been stopped, and he is still
expected to leave Tientsin on the ISth in
a British man-of-war, calling at Wei-
I hal-wei on his way to the south. It is
| thought at Peking that Sir Claude's
! health, which has suffered from strain
i and overwork, makes it necessary for him
to have a holiday, although he must
himself be averse to leaving Peking at
the present crisis.

Whether we are Republicans or Democrats, let

Shall tills republic endure or shall it die? Do
we know more than other men? Is there any
difference ln the patriotism of Spartan warfare

boys in far-away islands to better our condi

tem of government that will strangle us as a
nation? I fear that the retrogression of na

archaeologists to dig some day to find out if
we ever existed.
The trusts of to-day are terrible for me to

SMOKE NUISANCE
PROVES COSTLY
Gas Company Made to
Pay Damages.

REDWOOD CITY. April 14â In the
case of W. O. Booth against the San
I Mateo Gaslight Company, Judge Buck
I has just filed an opinion granting the
: plaintiff the relief prayed- for in his
complaint and $500 damages. The com-
I plaint was filed by W. O. Booth in
' August of last year. Booth is a resi
i dent of San Mateo. The defendant is
j a corporation, having its principal
; place of business in the same place and
is engaged in manufacturing gas in the
central and populous portion of the
i town. The gas plant proved a nuisance
j to the p! ilntiff on account of Its close
I proximity to his residence and he
i brought suit to have the nuisance
! abated and for $5000 damages claimed
i to have been sustained by him and his
I family.
The complaint alleged that until
i within sixty days previous to the com
mencement of the action the defendant
I was engaged in its business in a por
| tion of the town eight blocks distant
from its present site and in a com
paratively uninhabited locality. Sixty
days prior to the filing of the suit the
; company moved its works to the rear
of and immediately adjoining the land
and dwelling of the plaintiff. Sickening
odors and gases have entered the Booth
home, to the detriment of its occupants"
health. The plaintiff and his family
have frequently been nauseated and
troubled with headache.
Booth attacked the manner in which
the plant was conducted. He said that
it was a primitive and incomplete con
| cern and by reason of the fires kept In
I the furnaces and by reason, also, of
: the defendant's carelessness, reckless

accosted by a local Chinese Interpreter,
who had been let into the secret, but paid

Manuel Chavez will be executed at 10:30

and cowardly In the superlative degree.
Chavez sneers at his fate. He showed no

Quay's Counsel Fights
to Shut It Out.
BUT IT'S A BANK RECORD
EXPERT TESTIMONY GIVEN
WITHOUT USING NAMES.
Entries Made by Cashier Hopkins,
Who Committed Suicide, Expected
to Show the Guilt of the
Ex-Senator.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PHILADELPHIA. April 14.âPersist
ent, keen and brilliant argument be
tween District Attorney Rothermel on
the one side and Messrs. Watson, Shap
ley and Shields on the other upon the
admission of testimony which may go
a long way to establish the alleged
guilt of ex-United States Senator Quay
was the feature of to-day's trial, and
it culminated in a decided victory for
the prosecution.
The red book found in Cashier Hop
kins' desk after his suicide, and upon
the admission of which the common
wealth so largely rests its case, was
the shaft the District Attorney aimed
at the defense. To pave the way for
the final effort to introduce, the book
itself he succeeded, after .frequent
clashes with opposing counsel, some
times bitter and personal, in presenting
expert testimony to prove that the
book was necessarily a book of the
bank, as accounts in the books admitted
under the court's ruling would be made
intelligible by the red book.
Before starting his examination
Rothermel read to the court a state
ment of what he intended to prove.
The expert, he said, had made a thor
ough examination of all the books in
the case. He found that previous to
April 30, l.yi. the People's Bank paid
interest on the State deposit to the
State Treasurer, and that records of
such payments were kept in a regular
way un the books of the bank. After
April 30, 1891, when Mr. Hopkins ap- \
peared on the scene, a new system was
adopted. This entailed the addition of
another bookâ now known as the red
bookâ to the books heretofore kept by
the bank.
Meyer Goldsmith, an expert account
ant, was the witness upon whom the
commonwealth depended to accomplish
it's contention. During the whole course
of the expert's examination objection
after objection was made by the de
fense and as frequently overruled by
Judge Piddle, while the District Attor
ney in logical sequence drew from the
witness his conclusions as to the book,
based upon a comparison of what was
written on its pages with what ap
peared in the other books. Two ac
counts cut of upward of 1000 In the
regular books were incomplete and in
accurate unless explained by entries in
the red book. One was an item of $1519
entered in the individual ledger to the
credit of the person who received it. The
witness was not permitted to designate
the persons by name. He found this
item on the stub of the cashier's check
book, but what it represented he could
not say until he had examined the cal
culations in the red book. Here he
found the amount entered and the in
dications that it had been paid by the
cashier's check on November 4, 18.7.
Another item of $5325 25 he found in the
red book, dated October 30, 1894. He
stated that there were other entries in
the red book which explained transac
tions in the regular book, but the two
instances specified were the only ones
in which he had reached accurate con
clusions as to their nature and pur
pose.
Goldsmith said that when he first
opened the red book he did not consider
it a book of the bank, but when he
compared the calculations entered on
its pages with transactions in the other
books he was forced to consider it a
book of the bank. He explained this
by saying that prior to 1891 calculations
such as appeared in the red book were
regularly entered in the ledger, but
since then the red book had been sub
stituted and fulfilled and fixed the
same results.
During the cross-examination of this
witness, which was conducted by Mr.
"Shields, he testified as to a page which
was missing. The defense repeatedly
endeavored to get from him the state
ment that there might have been fig
ures and words on that page, which
would clearly explain the entries on the
other pages, and that the book as it
now stands is unreliable.- This was
ruled out, following an objection by the
District Attorney. This would seem to
indicate that when the final effort to
present the book in evidence comes to
morrow, the defense will make another
determined opposition to it on that
ground, even if the court should decide
that with relation to the transactions
testified to it is a book of the bank.
During all the examination touching
on the book, with the exception of the
two items mentioned, no intimation of
the amounts or names were allowed to
reach the jury. The prosecution all
along, however, has alleged that this
book will show that Cashier Hopkins
computed it on State funds and de
posited the money to Senator Quay's
credit. _______________________
HEAVY CUT IN RATES.
tyy.^\.:^' â
Los Angeles Lighting Co- panics En-
gage in a Bitter Warfare.
LOS ANGELES. April 14.â The failure
of the attempt to form a combination be
tween the Los Angeles Electric, the Edi
son and the San Gabriel lighting compa
nies has been followed by a war in rates
that has given Joy to consumers. The at
tempt to district the city, establish rates
and combine for mutual protection was
defeated, it is said by those who are cog
nizant of the facts, by the Los Angeles
Electric Company, it insisted on being
granted territory embracing half of the
city, on the ground that it was the pio
neer in the field. To retaliate the Edi
son and the San Gabriel companies have
made a cut which is equal to 60 per cent
on the average of all classes of lights,
forcing the Los Angeles, people to meet
this cut to-day. The end of this warfare
is not in sight, and as President Barker
of the Edison Company is in the East, no
cessation of hostilities is expected until
the object of his mission in the East is
accomplished.
GANS KNOCKED OUT.
George McFadden Defeats the Vet

NEW YORK, April 14.â Gans, the

down before George McFadden- of New
York in the twenty-third round of their
fight at the New Broadway Athletic Club
to-night. Gans was not completely
knocked out, but fell from exhaustion
and. was unable to regain his feet. It
was a rattling good fight to -watch and
the 5000 spectators cheered the winner on
to victory. McFadden gave the most re
markable exhibition of blocking ever seen
In a local ring.
The men signed to fight at 133 pounds,
but McFadden was five pounds under the
mark. ,

King Humbert Visits Fournier's
Fleet and Some Significant
Speeches Are Made.
CAGLIARI, Island of Sardinia, April 14.â The King and Queen of Italy,
accompanied by their suites and the Cabinet Ministers, lunched to-day
on board the French flagship Brennus. Great enthusiasm prevailed.
During the luncheon Vice Admiral Fournier toasted their Majesties
and in the name of President Loubet thanked them for the honor con
ferred by their visit to the French fleet, which he described as "conveying
fresh proofs of the sympathies of your Majesties with France."
King Humbert, in his reply, said: "Admiral, the sentiments you have
just expressed toward the Queen and myself and the wish which you
frame for our country in the name of your President And in our hearts the
same sympathetic echo. ; We. welcome the resumption of good commercial
relations with France. Italy, is animated by these feelings of cordial friend
ship and we drink to the happiness of France and the health of her Presi
dent. We thank him cordially for sending this fine squadron here, and you
ought to be as proud of the display as you are worthy to command."
As their Majesties left the ship, a royal salute was fired. Later In the
day King Humbert and Queen* Margherita received the Senators and Dep
uties in the royal pavilion.
NEW YORK, April 14.â A cable to the Sun from Paris says: The Jour
nal and Matin say that Admiral Fournier, commander of the French
Mediterranean squadron, which will shortly be reviewed by King Humbert
of Italy, off Cagliari, Sardinia, is charged with a commission to discuss
the position of Italy in the naval equilibrium of the Mediterranean. The
admiral will represent the advantage to Italy of securing the friendship of
France and suggest that a Franco- Italian naval combination would be of
more advantage to Italy than an English alliance. It is asserted that
Admiral Fournier has addressed a letter to King Humbert on the subject.
HOLD A BARONET'S
BODY FOR RANSOM
Indians Have Sir Arthur
Curtis' Remains.
Social Dispatch to The Call.
VICTORIA, B. C, April 14â News
comes from the Hudson Bay posts on
the Ashcroft trail to the Stickeen River
and Lake Teslin to the effect that In
dians in the employ of the Hudson Bay
Company have a clew which probably
will lead to the recovery of the body of
Sir Arthur Curtis, the young English
baronet, who is supposed to have com
mitted suicide because of the hardships
he encountered on the Canadian trail.
The body is said to be in the posses
sion of American Indians, who have
carefully buried it and expect to get a
big ransom when the present ' search
instituted by his English relatives shall
have been abandoned. The Hudson
Bay Indians hope to obtain the body
by force and get the offered reward for
themselves. An Indian war over the
unfortunate lord's remains may result.
The story of Sir Arthur Curtis' death
is a sad one. He had been ranching at
Cosham, as many another wild young
Englishman of blue blood has done. He
got the Klondike fever and â  with a
party of eight started over the Ash
croft trail. They had an elaborate out
fit and for a few' hundred miles all
went well. -'â¢â¢":">*
Their troubles began before they
reached Mud River. They crossed that
stream on June 9 last year. - The next
morning Sir Arthur seemed moody. All
of the horses had been stampeded dur
ing the night and were nowhere to be
found. He loaded his revolver, lighted
his pipe and walked into the woods,
after saying good-by to Roger Pocock,
whose turn it was to guard the camp.
Sir Arthur never returned. There
were several theories regarding his
death. He might have fallen into one
of the sluggish branches of the Mud
River and lost his life. He might have
been killed by Indians. He might, in
a fit of despondency, have [ taken his
own life. The latter theory. is almost
generally believed.
The Indians soon gave evidence that
they were holding the body for ran
som, and they were offered $1000 for it.
They demanded $5000. but there was
every prospect that they would not
give up the body on the payment of
even that amount.
There has been no news from the
Mud River country for some time. The
news brought by the Farallon from
Dawson reached that city by Hudson
Bay Company carriers, who manage to
travel all over the great northland in
spite of the season.

. According to the statement of some
of the prisoners the Filipinos drove a
hundred Spanish prisoners and twelve
priests about Santa Cruz at the point
of the bayonet on Sunday night. Four
of the priests died of starvation. It
appears that the Filipino force at Santa

there was some suffering on that score.
Big Crops in Yolo County.

a very few localities all varieties of fruit
will yield well. There is a larger area
sown to wheat than ever before, and the
Indications are good for big crops in the

Club sang its songs, the mandolin club
touched the strings. Frank B. Riley gave
some excellent monologues and R. V.

a clever bit of pencil and monologue
work, won for the artist much applause
and several encores.
Mr. Hirshfeld, Berkeley's sole represen
tative on the programme, gave a splendid
sleight-of-hand performance.
To-day will be the great day of the fete.
This afternoon a programme calculated to
especially delight the young folks will be
ln order. In the evening the lowa boys
will hold the stage and give the great
vaudeville performance that has made
them as famous as performers as fighters.
To accommodate the large crowd that Is
expected this evening a limited number of
seats may be reserved at an extra charge
of 50 cents.
By general request the managers of the
Children's Hospital have decided to post
pone the charity ball which was to have
been held on Monday evening until next
September. The request came from many
of the patrons of the charity, who have
already taken up their residence in the
country, and the desire for a postpone
ment has been so general that it has been
acceded to.
The charity bail for the benefit of the
Children's Hospital will be the first large
event of the winter season of 1899.

MRS, MURDOCH
CASE IS CLOSED
Opening Statement by
the Defense.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WILLOWS. April When the Mur
dock note case was resumed this morn
ing H. A. Skiff was called to the stand
for redirect examination. He testified
that he had not made the statement to
any one that he was to get $10,000 for
his testimony.
Mrs. M. J. Glover followed Skiff and
told how she had met the plaintiff at
Allen Springs in 1577. During the first
days of September of that year her
husband, who had been down at their
home near Orland, came up to the
spring's and reported to Mrs. Murdock
that there was trouble between the lat
ter's husband on the one side and
Samuel Murdock and William Murdock
on the other. Mrs. Murdock was sum
moned home about the first of Septem
ber and left immediately, remaining
four or five days. Th" witness cared
for the plaintiff's children while she
was absent. General Barnes failed to
shake her testimony.
C. B. Ashurst was recalled. He said
he had called on William Murdock just
a few months before the latter's death
Murdock told him of a large debt he
had to pay soon.
D. W. A. Sehorn said that in IM>4 he
was told by B. H. Burton, one of the
executors of the estate, that had Wil
liam Murd lived a few weeks longer
the note would have been settled.
After the introduction of an assign
ment of the note from William Meggin
scn to the plaintiff and the reading of
the deposition of William Megginson
the plaintiff rested.
In its opening statement the defense
claimed it would prove the note was
forged. Handwriting experts will be
gin their testimony on Monday.

WEED'S HONESTY
WAS QUESTIONED
Why the Woodland Man
Ended His Life.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WOODLAND, April 14.â The body of
the late James Oscar Weed was taken
I'OODLAND, April 14.â The body of
late James Oscar Weed was taken
to Oroville for burial this morning.
The inquest will not be held until Mon
day. There is no longer any doubt that
it was a case of suicide. In one of
Weed's pockets was found a box con
taining about a quarter of a grain of
morphine. The name of the store from
which the purchase had been made was
erased. The theory is that he had been
taking the morphine for twenty-four
hours, and possibly longer, with sui
cidal intent.
Drs. Voisard and Kier held an au
topsy. They discovered that all the
organs of the body were in a healthy
condition and that death was due to
; opium narcosis, induced by taking mor
phine.
Friends of the deceased now recall
I the fact that he had been very despond
! ent for some time. About four years
I ago he came from Chico and engaged
in the livery business. He lost money
' in the venture and two years ago re
tired. He afterward engaged in buying
and selling horses, but with no better
success. For nearly a year he had been
out of employment and much depressed
; on account of financial embarrassment.
j It transpires that he was further wor
â¢ ried because of insinuations that he had
! not properly managed ft trust left in
j his hands.
On the death of his brother Albert,
! James Weed was appointed administra
j tor of the estate, which consisted of
some property in Chico. Last week his
niece, Emma Weed, caused him to be
cited to appear in the Superior Court
I of Butte County and make a showing
jof his management of the estate. She
was induced to take this course by
others on the assumption that he
handled some money of the estate for
which he failed to account. It was _.
pected he would answer the citation on
Saturday.
His sister, Miss M. J. Weed, who ar
rived from Chico this morning, says
that when she visited him in February
she found him very gloomy because
one of his own blood had questioned his
integrity, and he then expressed a wish
to be dead.
Miss Weed says the estate has been
well managed; her brother handled no
money belonging to it and she is cer
tain an investigation will show he has
never wronged his niece out of a dol
lar. She wrote to him to answer the
citation and that his explanation would
be entirely satisfactory to the court
and would effectually silence all evil
reports affecting his Integrity.
She is confident his own financial
troubles, coupled with the humiliation
of having his honor questioned by his
own relatives, weighed so heavily upon
his mind that he determined to end it
all by taking his own life.
Woodland people who knew Mr.
Weed intimately attach much Impor
tance to Miss Weed's statement. Many
persons knew of his financial reverses
but all credited him with being an hon
orable, high-minded man, incapable of
willfully injuring any person.
RABBI SOLOMON WILL
VACATE HIS PULPIT
LOS ANGELES, April 14. -Discord ex
ists in the congregation of B'nai Brith,
and Dr. M. G. Solomon, who has occu
pied the pulpit of the synagogue for the
past four years, will vacate on October
31, when his present term expires. The
trouble arises from the independent con
: duct of the rabbi, a leading Jewish fam
! ily taking a prominent part in the pro-
I ceedings. The feeling has been of long
standing, and while efforts have been
made to bridge the chain., dissensions
j have grown, causing the eminent divine
| to decline overtures for re-election.
Friends of Rabbi Solomon say his ene
mies complain unjustly because of Me in
! dependence of action, and assert that
those who Â» are causing the trou
, ble are the ones who followed a
similar course ever since they have
i formed part of the congregation. Rabbi
; Solomon is accused of possessing a self
: assertive and independent air, and of be
! ing entirely too fond of having his own
way. Herman W. Hellman, president of
the congregation, speaks in the highest
terms of the rabbi.
"Personally," he said, "I admire Rabbi
; Solomon's independent spirit. He has
| been a hard-worker and has established
an excellent system in the church. He
' thinks it best, however, to retire since
| there is discord in the congregation. He
will be able to command a good position;
I he Is a well educated and capable man."

SAN JOSE-LOS GATOS
RAILWAY PROJECT
SAN JOSE, April 14.â An electric rail
way to connect Los Gatos with this city
is among the possibilities of the future.
Several times the project has been
brought to light, and two years ago a
survey was made and rights of way ob
tained. This time the Los Gatos people
have taken hold in earnest. A prospectus
has been issued and subscriptions of stock
solicited. .
The road is to be known as the People's
Electric Road. The capital stock has been
placed at $75,000, divided into 15.000 shares
of the par value of $5 each. H. M. Barker
J. H. Becker, A. Malpas and P. H. Jordan
of Los Gatos and H. T. Matthews of San
Jose are the prime movers. Some $5000 In
stock has already been raised. The price
of building and equipping the road Is to
be raised by subscription in either stock
or bonds of denominations of $5 or up
ward. The bonds will run for twenty
years and are to be a first lien on the
road. ...
The length of the road will be about ten
miles. It will traverse a thickly settled
part of the valley and in all probability
will pay from the start

THE STOCK OF
THE NATIONAL
BANKS TAXED
Shareholders Cannot
Now Escape.
TIREY L FORD'S OPINION
ASSESSMENTS TO BE MADE ON
OVER NINE MILLIONS.
A Bitter Fight in the Legislature in
the Interests of Wealthy Cor
porations and Heavy
Capitalists,
Probably no hill Introduced in the late
Legislature was more bitterly fought by
combined capital than a measure intro
duced by Assemblyman Muenter of San
Joaquin County. Mr. Muenter's bill pro
vided for the assessment and taxation of
the entire stock issue of California's na
tional banks. It was fought, not only by
the agents of the banking institutions,
but by the heaviest holders of their cer
tificates. Assemblyman Grove L. John
son of Sacramento was the acknowledged
agent of the allied banks on the floor of
the Assembly and resorted to every pos
sible scheme to prevent the progress of
the bill from the time it first appeared
in the House. Only the constant vigilance
of Mr. Muenter prevented the success of
the plans of Johnson and the powerful
i lobby that was dispatched to Sacramento
to his assistance.
Considering the fact that the bill would
impose a tax on $9,000,000 Invested in a
collateral that had previously been al
lowed to accrue its profits without license
of any sort, the attitude of the banking
fraternity and Johnson's tireless energy
1 in his fight to defeat it are not to be won-
I dered at. The first attempt to enforce the
| provisions of the new statute was made
j in Los Angeles County, where the officials
. of the warm belt were confronted by legal
| mists that they were unable to Bee
through, ln order to secure legal light
! upon the subject the District Attorney
' sent to the Attorney General, Tirey . 1-.
! Ford, for his opinion. * Mr. Ford's answer [
I is in substance that the stock should be |
assessed the same: as other property, as
the following shows: ':**'?â¢*".
SAN FRANCISCO, April 14, 15.9..
James >'. Rives, District Attorney. Los An
geles, CaLâ Dear Sir: In your communication
of March 23, IS&9, You say:
"We desire your opinion upon a question sub
mitted to us by .the Assessor of .Los Angeles
County, In connection with the assessment of
national banks for the fiscal year of 15..-1900,
for which th.- Assessor is now making his as- :
sessment. According to Information obtainable i
by us the Legislature hits amended section
36.8 and added sections 3609 â¢ and 8610 to the <
Political Code, providing lor a. scheme tor the I
assessment of stock ln national banks. This
statute, -we are Informed, was signed, by the j
Governor on March 14, 1899, and went into ef- '.
feet by its provisions on that day, and the i
Assessor as,..- and we desire your opinion on
the question as to -whether or not. this scheme
of assessment should be followed in reference
to national banks In assessing for the year In
dicated, or whether the act, not having gone !
Into effect until March 14, It would be proper
to assess under its provisions this year. March
1 being the date on which the liens for taxes
attach." â¢ . ,
Assuming "the validity of the act of I*., and
\ of the. constitutional right of the Legislature to
I enact; the same, .- as to â¢ which , matters 1 ; ex
press; no present opinion, 1 beg leave to sub
! Mit the following conclusions . with - reference
; to the. precise Inquiry contained in your com
munication,- namely, whether the scheme of
assessment provided for in said act should be
| followed by the County Assessors In their as
sessments for. the year 1893, "or, whether the
act, not having gone into effect until March
14, it would be proper to assess under Its pro
visions this year, March 1 being the date on |
which liens for taxes attach." Prior to the
amendments to the Political Code of 1599, to
which you refer, It may be doubted whether
shares of stock of national banks, as such,
situate in this State, could be assessed, for
assuming that such shares of stock were liable
to assessment as other personal property under
article XIII, section 1, of the constitution of
this State, and In pursuance of section 6219
of the Revised Statutes of the United States,
the section of the constitution here referred to
was not self-executing and, therefore, re
quired legislative enactment to provide the
mode of fixing the valuation, etc., of such
shares of stock.
M Henry vs. Downer, 116 CaL, 20; Teople vs.
National Bank, etc., 17 Cal. Dec. P., 2; Mil
ler vs. Hellbron, 58 cal., 133-141.
This the Legislature failed to do prior to the
addition of sections 3609 and 3610 of the Politi
cal Code In 1899. The constitutional provision
above referred" to. In conjunction with section
5219 of the Revised" Statutes of the United
States, permits the taxing of shares of stock
of national banks as other personal property
Is taxed.
Following the constitutional provision refer
red to, section 362$ of the Political Code pro
vides for the assessment of property to the
persons by whom It was owned or claimed or
In whose possession or control It was at 12
o'clock meridian on the first Monday In
March of each year, and the same section of
the Political Code also provides that the Asses
sor must between the first Monday ln March
and the first Monday in July of each year as
certain the names of all taxable Inhabitants
and all property in his county subject to tax
ation, etc. Section 3652 of the Political Code
provides that he must complete his assessment
book on or before the first Monday in July Qf
each year, and sections 3609 and 3610 of the
Political Code, added in 1899, and taking effect
March 14, 1599, In other words, Immediately
upon Its passage, provide the mode of arrest
ment of the stock of national banks. Sectjpn
3717 of the Political Code provides that every
tax due upon personal property is a lien upon
the real estate of the owner from and after
12 o'clock meridian of the first Monday in
March of each year.
In San Francisco vs. Pennle, 93 Cal. 465. Har
rison, J., ln speaking of section 3628, at page
473, says:
"The Assessor Is not required to make his
assessment on that day. Section 3628 of the
Political Code provides that 'the Assessor must,
between the first Mondays of March and July
ln each year, ascertain â¢ * * all property lit
his county subject to taxation * â¢ â¢ "and
must assess such property to the persons by
whom It was owned or claimed, or in whose
possession or control It was at 12 o'clock m.,
of the first Monday of March next preceding';
and section 3625 of the same code provides that
he must complete his assessment book on or
before the first Monday In July in each year.
In the City and County of San Francisco the
Assessor must complete the assessment of per
sonal property on or before the first Monday
of June in each year (Stats. 1874, p. 447). The
value of the property is to be fixed as of the
first Monday of March, but a subsequent as
certainment by the Assessor that such prop
erty was on that day under the control of the
Individual assessed Is within the provisions of
the statute, and In the present case It Is not
disputed that such was the fact.
It Is therefore evident that the value of per
sonal property Is to be fixed as of the first Mon
day in March of each year.
The tax on the stock of national banks Is
due when assessed (see sections 3820 and 3K21.
Political Code) ; in any event, within ten days
thereafter 'see section 3610, Political Code,
added in 18991. and so in no case where the
property Is assessed after the first Monday In
March of each year, but within the time al
lowed by law, would the statute operate In any
manner different than It does under said sec
tions 3609 and 3610, Political Code.
Under the case of McHenry vs. Downey, and
other cases cited, and section 5219, Revised
Statutes, supra, it would seem clear that the
shares of stock of a national bank have been
liable to taxation, as other personal property,
at all times since the adoption of the State
constitution In 1879; but, assuming that such
shares were exempt from taxation, still this
would not prevent the Legislature from revok
ing the exemption and imposing a tax upon
the shares, within the proper limits, because
there is no vested right In a statutory exemp
tion of property from taxation when the ex
emption is granted as a mere privilege or
gratuity, and not upon a contract or consider
ation moving to the public. (Cooley's Const.
I.im., section 353; Welty on Assessment, sec
tion 176; Christ Church vs. City of Philadelphia.
24 How., 801.) .. . .':
There being no vested right in the exemp
tion conceding such exemption, it was within
the power of the Legislature to. -.revoke the
exemption and Impose a tax, even- though by
so doing It might Impose a tax retrospectively.
I am therefore of the opinion that under the
law as It now stands the Assessor of your
county should proceed to assess the shares of
stock of the national banks as required by sec
tions 360?, 8909 and 3610 of the Political Code I
for the fiscal year 1899-1900. Very truly yours. !
TIREY I. FORD. Attorney General.

COOK MAKES REPLY.
Answers Judge Coffey's Letter Re- \
garding Guardianship Cases.
Judge Coffey of Department 9 of the j
Superior Court of this city has commu- j
nicated with the presiding Judge of the
court asking that in future guardianship
cases be assigned to other departments
of the court. Judge Coffey makes this ,
request by reason of a decision handed '
down by Judge Cook releasing little
Emma Hoag from the Maria Kip Orphan
age on a writ of habeas corpus and tech
nically giving the child into the custody
of her mother, Mrs. Katherine Bennett,
from whom she was taken by order of
Judge Coffey. As Judge Coffey's request
to Presiding Judge Daingerfield, asking
that no more guardianship cases be as
signed to his court is a direct slap, at
Judge Cook, that jurist .has written the
following reply, which is now 'In the
hands of Judge Coffey:
~~\fl April 14. 1899.'
Hon. J. V. Coffey, Judge of Superior Court-
Dear Sir: My attention has been called to a
note sent by you to the presiding Judge of this
court .wherein you attempt to criticize my ac
tion ln a habeas corpus proceeding assigned me
for hearing by Judge Dalngerfleld. .
Before thus petulantly expressing your feel
ings you should have ascertained the facts. It
la not my business to act as both Judge ftnd
counsel, and when cases are submitted with
out any evidence counsel so submitting them
are not usually entitled to judgment. In the
case ln question the respondent's attorney sub
mitted his case without offering or even - pro
ducing any letters of guardianship, either from
your department or any other. He contented
himself with offering only an order for the
Issuance of such letters, which order was con
ditional on its face (and the condition had not
been complied with when Judge Daingertield Is
sued the writ) and a guardian's bond. No let
ters of guardianship were offered at all and the
case was submitted. I refused to order the
child into her mother's custody, but being over
14 years of age and no evidence being pro
duced to show any one entitled to detain her,
on the suggestion of the attorney for the or
phanage I permitted her to go where she
wished. Respectfully, CARROLL COOK.
It is thought that Judge Cook's reply
will end the controversy, but as Judge
Coffey took great interest in the welfare
of little Miss Hoag it may be carried fur
ther. In any event. it is hoped that the
dignity of the court will not be sacrificed
during the settlement of this seemingly
important matter.
EDUCATORS CLOSE THEIR
INTERESTING INSTITUTE
ADDRESSES BY ABLE MEN FROM
THE UNIVERSITIES.
Committee on Resolutions Requests
the Supervisors to Set Aside a
Million and a Half for
. School Improvement.
The teachers' Institute, which has been
in progress during the past three days
in the auditorium of Mission High School,
was brought to a brilliant close yesterday
afternoon. The success of the institute
has been a marked one. It has attracted
an immense. attendance and those so for
tunate as to be present have heard the
best known educators in the State speak
on subjects with which they are familiar.
Both the University of California and
I.eland Stanford Jr. University sent their
most learned men to address the teachers.
Among the speakers yesterday was David
Starr Jordan, who has something inter
esting to say at all times. His theme was
"Value of Higher Education."
As has been the custom, proceedings
were opened with music, the contributors
representing the . ninth grades of -. the
Crocker Grammar School, under the di
rection of Miss Elizabeth .Wade.'- Henry
Meade Bland was the first speaker of the
day, his subject. being "A Few Thoughts
on the Making of School Law." .He said
that it .has been claimed that teachers
are not agreed upon the essentials of
school law. He held to the contrary, say
ing if they could be heard it would be
found that where any differences have
developed they resulted from attempts to
legislate in such a manner as to affect
localities instead of for the entire State.
One common point upon which the teach
ers are agreed is that there should- be
State institutes, where all the teachers
could be brought together for instruction
and study.
There should be a raising of the stand
ard of entrance requirements to the Nor
mal School. This will have the tendency
of elevating the profession of teaching.
There must be a more secure tenure of
office, and lastly, the influence of politics
must be removed from the schools. The
speaker suggested that 'nominations for
all school offices be placed in the hands
of conventions separated from all poli
tical parties and influences.
Professor Thomas P. Bailey of the Uni
versity of California spoke on "Love and
Law." His contribution to the pro
gramme was loudly applauded, and he
was compelled to bow his acknowledg
ment of the applause. He said in part:
"We want the law that can be fulfilled.
The law of habit which will go with the
child through life. The habit of rever
ence, the habit of veneration of custom.
This custom must then pass into law.
We must have strong law In the school-
room. I believe in the sovereignty of the
teacher. The teacher must feel that what
she does Is done with the authority of
the State behind her. The children must
be taught to look upon the teacher as the
representative of sovereign power. When
an attempt is made to put the authority
back to some one above the teacher she at
once loses authority over the pupils.
When too much of the responsibility is
taken away you get far away from the
true spirit of teaching, which is the influ
ence of one character over another. When
a teacher is unable to govern by the laws
of courtesy it is not best to go to the
Superintendent, but to replace that
teacher by another. You may be sure the
secret of true discipline lies in a proper
appreciation of character, of respect for
that and for the law of love. Having
these, we may be sure that the question
of school discipline will take care of It
self."
Mrs. Blanchard sang, and Miss Eliza
beth Bartlett recited. Professor Elmer
E. Brown, head of the department of
pedagogy at the University of Califor
nia, spoke on the "Social Aspect of Edu
cation."
President Jordan was the principal
speaker of the closing session.
The committee on resolutions, consist
ing of C. H. Murphy. T. B. White. Miss A:
E. Gavigan. Miss Jean Parker and W. H.
Edwards, submitter Its report. In tins i
they asked that when the Supervisors !
submit to the qualified voters of San i
Francisco the proposition of issuing |
bonds for permanent improvements they !
Include in that issue $1,500,000 for perma- j
nent improvements in the School Depart- I
ment. They expressed pride and pleasure |
in the fact that the next National Edu
cational Association meeting will be held j
here. They asked that entrance ad- I
mission to the California State Normal I
School be restricted to High School grad
uates or equivalent, and that the course
of study be limited to two years. Thank- I
were extended all the speakers and offi
cers of the School Department.

WANTED TO BE
REVENGED ON
THE MATRON
Lively Scene at the
Training Home.
Mabel Davis, aged 14 years, created con
siderable excitement at the Girls' Train
ing School on Natoma street, where she
Is confined, yesterday afternoon by de
claring her Intention of killing Miss
Shawhan, the matron. Seizing a carving
knife which she had concealed under the
mattress of her bed, she put it in the
sleeve of her dress and started out to find
the matron.
Several of her companions, who had
heard her threat, lost no time In noti
fying her intended victim. Summoning
two of her assistants, the matron had the
vicious girl strapped down until Police
man Coleman of the Society for the Pre
vention of. Cruelty to Children, who had
been notified, arrived. Coleman attempted
to quiet her, and Was rewarded by being
almost knocked off his feet by the infu
riated girl.
"You can't take me away until I kill
the matron," she fairly screeched. "She
has not treated me right and I want to
get even with her."
Coleman seized her by the arms and
started to lead her from the building. As
the girl is remarkably well developed for
her age and is astonishingly muscular, she
defied the policeman to remove her.
"I won't go with you," she angrily de
clared. "I know you want to lock me up
ln the City Prison."
Failing to Induce her to accompany him
Coleman seized her and started to drag
her downstairs. She fought viciously and
on reaching the door she, In her madness,
kicked a hole in one of the panels. Her
screams could be heard almost a block
away, demanding that the policeman re
lease her and pleading for a chance to
"get even" with the matron.
After considerable trouble Coleman
finally managed to reach the City Prison
with the girl, where she was booked for
some public institution. '
"I was treated like a dog by the matron
of the home." she remarked to Desk Ser
geant Bidwill. "Yesterday I took a knife
off the table, intending to use it In cut
ting some paper, when she roughly seized
me and locked me in a dark room. For
over twelve hours she fed me on nothing
but bread and water. After thinking over
my miserable existence I resolved to kill
her. and had one of the girls get a knife
for me. I put it up my sleeve. Intending
to use it at the first opportunity. Just as
my chance had arrived she became suspi
cious, and had one of fhe attendants
search me. The knife was found in my
sleeve and taken away from me.
"I'm sorry I did not have a chance to
show her that I meant business," she
rather mournfully remarked; "but if I
am sent back to the home she will be
carried out a corpse."
The vicious girl will not have an op
portunity to be revenged on the matron
of the home, as it Is the intention of the
police to have her sent to the Magdalen
Asylum to-day, where she will be thor
oughly disciplined.

ALASKA PACKERS'
ASSOCIATION
Will Take the Place of
" Wind- Jammers. "
PLANS ALREADY PERFECTED
THEY ARE TO BE BUILT OF
STEEL THROUGHOUT.
Orizaba to Take the City of Topeka's
Place in Alaskan Waters Ca
ptain Kustel to Turn Orange
Grower.
Henry F. Fortmann, president of the
Alaska Packers' Association, is nothing
if not progressive. He is a thorough ad
vocate of the use of the best material ob
tainable and is constantly on the lookout
for improvements In the machinery that
moves the vast concern over which he
presides.
The Alaska packers own and operate
the largest fleet of sailing vessels and
small steamers on the Pacific Ocean, but
it is Mr. Fortmann's ambition to see the
"wind-jammers" replaced in part, if not
ether, with ocean-going steamers.
With this object in view the plans are
now being perfected for the building of
one .of the finest steel steamers of her
class ever seen on this coast. Instead of
the designing being left to the builders
-.the plans for the new vessel have all been
/made by the association's engineers and
I the.steamer will be built under their su
pervision.
The designs for the new vessel have
been made by W. P. Lindley and the de
tail drawings' of the engine by Tom Ran
som. The name has not yet been decided
upon but on the plans the new steamer
appears as "The 1900." She will be built
of steel throughout, no wood being used
except in the trimmings of the cabins and
the facings of the berths. She will be
217 feet over all. 35 feet beam and IS feet
deep, with a displacement of 2100 tons.
All the scantlings used in her construc
tion will be in excess of Lloyds demands
so as to make her extra strong, and, be
sides this, she will have a cellular double
bottom and six water-tight compartments.
The main hatches are to be very large,
so as to make the handling of long tim
bers and heavy packages easy. The
lower hold is to be 108 feet clear and Is to
le specially fitted for the carrying of
33,'> k.i cases of salmon. The 'tweendecks
will he very large and commodious and
would make the vessel a splendid troop
ship.
"The 1900" W ill be fitted with two en
gines and twin screws. Her Babcoi k &
Wilcox water-tube boilers will have a
work pressure of 225 pounds and a
heating surface of Â».tOO feet. She will have
inverted cylinders of the triple expansion
type, with a diameter of 9.154 and .'7
inches and a common stroke of 24 inches.
There will be piston valves in the high and
intermediate cylinders, and a double port
ed slide in the lower pressure, all of which
will be worked by the Stephenson valve
gear. The crank shaft will be of the
built-up type and 6 inches in diameter,
There will be an evaporator and auxil
iary condenser and a steam reversing en
gine.
The engines will be 750 horsepower, and
the 1900 will average 10 knots. She will
have accommodation for twenty-six cabin
and twenty-six steerage passengers. She :
will lie fitted with steam steering gear,
steam towing machine, steam capstan,
and electric light plant, with a 12-inch :
projector searchlight.
In her passenger accommodations she |
will have bath rooms, social hall, dining
room, private dining room, smoking room, i
and a splendid galley. The officers' quar
ters and the smoking room will all be on
the upper deck. Bids for the new steamer
will be called for in a few days, and until
they have been open. .1 it will not be
known whether she will be built in San
Francisco or elsewhere.
The Pacific Coast Steamship Company
â¢will withdraw the steamer Orizaba from
the southern route in a tew days and
send her to Pugel Sound to take up the
business of th.- City of Topeka on the
.Alaska line. The Topeka went on the
rocks in Wrangel Narrows but was got
off, and when last seen was on her way
to Juneau for temporary repairs. The
Orizaba's place on the southern run will
be taken by the Bonita. The latter vessel
has been thoroughly overhauled and built
up, and is now a first-class passenger
steamer.
Captain Oscar Kustel of the ship Ha
waiian Isles has given up the sea and is
going to purchase an orange orchard in
Southern California. 1 1.- and his wife left
for Los Angeles last night. Captain Kus
tel was succeeded in the command of the
Hawaiian Isles by Captain Rice, late of
the Bundaleer. Captain Kustel, always
accompanied by his wife, has been at sea
continuously for fifteen years. When he
moved his belongings ashore from the
Hawaiian Isles It was the first time in all
those years that he and his spouse had
slept on terra flrraa. He now vows that
he will never sleep on shipboard again,
but will spend the evening of life in culti
vating oranges.
There was considerable trouble in dock
ing he ship Charmer. An attempt was
made to get her in at Spear street, but it
was only after four tugs had been at work
on her that she was got alongside. Then
it was discovered that her forefoot was
resting on a rock, bo she had to be taken
into the 'am. Finally a berth at an
other wharf was secured and she was
placed in it. She will begin discharging
to-day.
The harbor police are looking for two
silk dresses that came here on the United
States transport Hancock (Arizona), from
Manila. They were richly embroidered by
Filipinos and valued at $300. At Manila
they were boxed up and given in care of
Captain Ames. That officer turned them
over to the mate, and the mate in turn
gave them In charge of the bosun. They
are now missing and Officer "Tom" Ellis
Is trying to locate them.

STEEL STEAMER -1900" AS SHE WILL APPEAR.
THE Alaska Packers' Association contemplates replacing its fleet of '-wind-jammers" with steamers.
The change may not take place for some time to come, but for the sake of comparison a modern
steel steamer is to be built. No expense will be spared in her construction, and she will be the su

City and County Attorney Lane
Advises That Members of the
Board May Become Law
Breakers.
At the meeting of the Board of Super
visors next Monday the Health and Police
Committee will present an adverse report
.mi the proposed ordinance to place an an
nual license of $5000 on athletic clubs de
siring to conduct prize fights. The report
will also recommend that the Board of
Supervisors ignore the provisions of the
new State law regulating prize fights and
boxing contests, and proceed with the is
suance pf permits for boxing contests
which are now held to be contrary to the
law. â 
This very remarkable report was formu
lated yesterday after the members of the
Health and Police Committee had been
advised by the City and County Attorney
that if the Board of Supervisors granted
a permit to an athletic club to hold a box-
Ing exhibition without first exacting the
payment of an annual license by such
club, then the Supervisors would be liable
to arrest and prosecution for aiding and
abetting a prize light. This offense, under
the provisions of the new State law, is
defined as a felony.
The members of the committee who
voted to place themselves and their broth
er Supervisors in this position as regards
the State law are Chairman Collins and
Supervisors Heyer and Lackmann. The
decision was not arrived at without some
discussion, though Supervisor Heyer con
a-iiueu Hum tnt beginning tnat toe State
law should be ignored and that the board
continue to deal with rights and fighters
in the future as it has in the past.
City and County Attorney Lane was
sent for and asked to make clear some of
the points not covered by his opinion on
the subject of the new law which was
given by him some days ago. In reply to
questions Attorney Lane said that the
new law prohibits all kinds of prize light
ing and boxing contests, but adds a pro
viso which permits the holding of a lim
ited round boxing contest, provided the
club holding the -contest is incorporated
under the laws of the State and has first
paid in advance an annual license fee to
be fixed by the Board of Supervisors of
the county in which the contest is held
He said the law does not require the '
Board of Supervisors to fix this annual
license fee, but if the amount of the fee
was not fixed and Its payment required,
ben a boxing contest could not be held
without a violation of the law. If the
Board of Supervisors granted a permit
for the holding of a boxing contest with
out first having exacted the payment of
an annual license fee. then the members
of the board would probably be liable to
arrest and conviction for aiding and abet
ting an act that is by the law prohibited
and defined as a felony.
The arguments of the City and County
Attorney were not convincing to Super
visor Heyer. He seemed to think the
Legislature had invaded the rights of the
Board of Supervisors by tinkering the
prize light law, and he was in favor of
Ignoring the new statute and allowing
things to drift along in the same old
channel. There was some talk of post
poning action, but at the suggestion of
Supervisor Lackmann the committee
agreed to report against the proposed
ordinance on the ground that the exaction
of an annual license fee was "impracti
cable," and also that In future permits
for boxing contests should.be granted as
they have in the past, without regard to
the provisions of the State law. ..;'â¢

GEORGE CROCKER
SAYS HE WON NO
GILDED BRICK
Huntington's Gift Was
the Real Thing.
MRS. STANFORD ISN'T MAD
ALL ABE FRIENDS AND TOO
HAPPY FOR SPEECH.
The Whole Company Cheerfully De
nies That the New Vice Presi
dent Was a Victim of Hunt
ington's Confidence Game.
George Crocker has been handed no gold
brick by Mr. Huntington. The article ten
dered him in return for his and the Stan
ford votes is of the pure quill and nine
hundred and odd fine. It's no robe of
woven, shimmering tinsel he is from this
date heir to. It's the royal purple itself
that has so long adorned the shoulders of
his friend, Mr. Huntington. This is ac
cording to the word of Mr. Crocker and
of Mr. Stubbs, and of the office boy, who
holds the unidentified up at the outer
portal, and of about everybody else who
finds a living with one or the other of tire
two companies. In fact, the whole build
ing yesterday, from the sidewalk to the
offices up under the roof, was pregnant
with denial of the allegation that Mr.
Crocker was anything less than as astute
a genus homo as the elder Mr. Hunting
ton and had not won his great battle by
the very wits that are in him. Mr. Hunt
ington's friends were particularly em
phatic, as a matter of course.
"The arrangement was arrived at in the
most amicable manner in the world," says
Mr. Crocker suavely, and added modestly:
' It was for the best interests of the com
pany all round. Stories of my alleged an
tipathy to Mr. H. E. Huntington are ludi
crous. We are all the best of friends, and
the Stanford interests are quite In accord,
notwithstanding all these statements to
the contrary. My election carries with it
nothing more significant than does the
election of General Hubbard or of Mr.
Stubbs or of Mr. Willcutt. It comes in the
natural sequence of events and means
none of this nonsense that has been
printed." â¢. â â â ', â¢
This last evidence of esteem on the part
of Mr. Huntington for Mr. Crockerâ the
first vice presidency of the California cor
porationâwas evidently the last brick the
crafty old man had in his basket to be
used for the purpose.
The Market -street railway directors met
yesterday to elect officers and there were
no evidences thereof the Crocker-Huntlng
ton differences. H. E. Huntington re
mains for another year the company's
president, and the other officers of last
year were elected. They were: Charles
Holbrook, vice president; Alvinza Hay
ward, second vice president; N. T. Smith,
treasurer, and J. L. Willcutt, secretary.
THE FIGHT FOR DECENCY.
John Carroll Convicted and Fined for
Having Indecent Pictures on
Exhibition.
â  John Carroll, proprietor of the phono
graph parlors at 724 Market street, was
convicted by acting Police Judge Barry
yesterday of having indecent pictures on
exhibition. The Judge said that he would
impose a fine of $10 as it was a first of
fense, but he warned the defendant that
if he was arrested again for a similar of
fense he would inflict a severe penalty.

STRUCK THE BLOWS
THAT KILLED BRENNEKE
EDWARD L. ANDERSON, SALOON
KEEPER, ARRESTED.
Police Allege They Have Three Wit
nesses Who Will Testify That
He Wielded the Club.
Edward Ludwig Anderson, proprietor of
the Scandinavian saloon at Montgomery
avenue and Jackson street, was arrested
yesterday morning by Detectives Dinan
and McMahon and Policeman Shaw and
locked up in "the tanks." He is suspect
ed as being the man who caused the
death of William Brenneke, the sailor,
last Wednesday. V.â'.
The police have two witnessesâ Gus
Buich and Charles Johansen, sailors, who
declare that they saw Anderson strike
Brenneke on the head with a club, and
they have another witness who will tes
tify to the same effect. The police have
"found the club with which it is alleged
the murder was committed. It was brak
en with the blows on Brenneke's head,
and a portion of it was found buried in
an ash barrel. ..:â¢:-:./-'
Brenneke and Buich were together be
fore they entered Anderson's saloon and
had some words with Johansen. A fight
ensued and Johansen was vanquished.
Brenneke and Buich then entered the
saloon, followed by Johansen, and raised
a disturbance. This angered Anderson
who, seizing the club, rushed -from behind
the bar and struck Brenneke on the head
with it. Brenneke was taken to the Har
bor Receiving Hospital, thence to the in
sane ward in the Receiving Hospital, as
it was believed that he was insane, and
finally was sent to the City and. County
Hospital, where he died.
Anderson denies that he was the man
who struck Brenneke with the club and
says he knows nothing about it. He
claims that there was a fight among the
sailors and Brenneke must have received
the blows that caused his death during
the fight. The Inqftesl will be held by
the Coroner this morning and no action
will be taken against Anderson pending
the result to be arrived at by the jury.
FLT.ING FROM THE SLIP.
Fast Dogs That Will Course at Union
Park lngleside Club Meeting
at Newark.
The Union Coursing Park Association
has an excellent programme booked for
to-day and to-morrow. Among the cele
brated dogs that will again pass under the
critical eye of Judge Bull are Connemara,
St. Or an, Theron. Moondyne, L. S. Conley,
Firm Friend, Young America, False Flat
terer and Rusty Gold. Of course there
are many other first-class dogs in the
open stake, but the ones named are looked
upon by experts of the game as the lead
ers of the society of longtalls who will cut
a! dash on Saturday and Sunday. Owing
to the very large entry leashmen must not
overlook the fact that the puppy stake
will commence (Saturday) promptly at 11
| o'clock, and on the arrival of the 12:55 p.
' m. train from this city the open stake will
ibe taken in hand and run down once. As
' the green grass of the park is rapidly dis
appearing under the rays of a hot sun, it
is sate to say that better racing may be
expected in future, as the hares are grow
ing hard and strong on dry food. Much
' interest is manifested in the course be
tween Moondvne and Theron. It is said,
that Moondyne is rapidly developing great
i speed under good and careful handling,
! and that if a strong hare is turned loose
i a grand race will assuredly result.
I The Ingleside Coursing Club will hold a
I grand open meeting at Newark Coursing
; Park on Sunday, the 23d inst. A thirty
two dog stake will be run on this occasion
i and the entrance fee will be $5. Leashmen
from Sacramento, Stockton, San Jose and,
in fact, many of the towns of the State
where coursing is a feature of sport, have
signified their Intentions of entering their
charges. The Ingleside Coursing Asso
ciation will add $150 to the stake. Doubt
less the drawing for the meeting will be
: held some evening during the coming
! week. A first-class band of music will be
i on hand to entertain the ladles.
INDUSTRIAL ART EXHIBIT.
It Will Run Three Days Longer Than
Was Originally Planned.
The exhibition of the Industrial Arts "of
California, for which the ladies of the
California Club are energetically prepar
ing, is outgrowing the scope and limits
originally proposed by the club.
A distinctly new lead has been opened
and surprises of all sorts await the com
mittees, which rather anticipated having
to prospect in a lively fashion for exhib

original design to fill the spaces at the
Pavilion Art Gallery. But applications
from artisans and artists all over â¢ the
State are flowing in. The press of San
Francisco and of the interior has grasped
the intention of the club women and wel
comed the enterprise, while prominent
architects and leaders in the handicraftsâ
those who need no advertisingâ are hast
ening to lend aid and advice.
It having been strongly urged upon the
club that the original datesâ from May
23 to 27â made too short a time, it was
agreed at the Thursday morning meeting
that the exhibition shall be held open
from Saturday evening. May 20, day and

A REMARKABLE INVENTION
BY AN OHIOAN.
A genius of Cincinnati has patented and
placed on the market a remarkable Bath
Cabinet, whereby any one resting on a
chair within enjoys the famous Turkish,
hot vapor or medicated baths at noma
for 3 cents each, heretofore enjoyed only
by the rich at public bathrooms, health
resorts, hot springs and sanitariums.
These baths are celebrated for their mar-
velous cleansing, purifying and invigorat-
ing effects upon the human system, and
this invention brings them within the
reach of the poorest person In the coun-
try. .:.!.-*â 
Clouds of hot vapor or medicated vapor
surround the entire body, opening the
millions of sweat pores, causing profuse

perspiration, drawing out of the system
all impure salts, acids and poisonous
matter, which, if retained, overwork the
heart, kidneys, lungs and skin, causing
disease, fevers, debility and sluggish-
ness.
Astonishing is the improvement in
health, feelings and complexion by the
use of this Cabinet, and it seems to us
that the long sought for natural method
of curing and preventing disease without
medicine has certainly been found.
The makers inform the writer that 82,-
-386 of these Quaker folding thermal Cabi-
nets have been sold since January 1. and
showed letters from thousands of users
who speak of this Cabinet as giving en-
tire satisfaction. ' ' -< ".
Since this invention bathtubs have been
discarded, for it gives a better bath for
all cleansing purposes than soap and wa-
ter, and, as there are millions of homes
without bathing facilities, it seems this
would be a good article for our readers
to take the agency for.
Thousands of remarkable letters have
been written the inventors, and to our
knowledge- persons who were full of
drugs and nostrums, and have been given
up to die, have been restored to perfect,
robust health, to the astonishment of
their friends and physicians.
E. L. Eaton, M. D., of Topeka, Kans.,
gave up his practice because, he said, he
_ould do more good for humanity with
this Cabinet than his medicines, and has
already sold more than 600 of .them. Con-
gressman John J. Lentz, Mrs. Senator
Douglas, Rev. R. E. Peale, Una, S. C;
Rev. Samuel Cooper, John T. Brown, edi-
tor of the Christian Guide, and a host
of our most eminent people recommend it.
J. A. Hagan, Richfield, Mo., afflicted fif-
teen years with rheumatism in its worst
form, was cured in six days; L. B. West-
brook, Newton, lowa, afflicted forty-five
years, was cured in three weeks of ca-
tarrh, asthma, heart and kidn%y trouble;
O. P. Freeman, Sparta, Ohio, afflicted sev-
enteen years, unable to walk, was cured
of kidney troubles, plies and rheumatism.
A prominent citizen of Elwood, Ind., E.
Veher, was cured of a serious case of
obesity. A lady in Maysville, Mo., Mrs.
L. Coen, was cured of woman's trou-
bles, and recommends it to all suffering
ladles.
We' find this is a genuine Cabinet, with
a door, handsomely and durably made of
best materials, rubber lined, has a steel
frame, and should certainly last a life-
time. .;.?. -' l
It is' important to know that the mak-
ers guarantee results, and assert- posi-
tively, as do thousands of users, that this
Cabinet will clear the skin, purify and
enrich the blood, cure nervousness, weak-'
ness, that tired feeling and. the worst
forms of rheumatism. (They offer $50 re-
ward for a case not relieved.) Cures wo-
man's troubles, malaria, ague, sleepless-
ness, neuralgia, headaches, piles, dropsy,
liver* kidney and nervous troubles. It
will make you strong, energetic, full of
life and vigor with the coming of spring
and summer, and avoid illness later.
To please the ladies', a face and head
steaming attachment is furnished, if de-
sired, which clears the skin, Beautifies the
complexion, removes pimples, black-
heads, eruptions and is a sure cure for
skin diseases, catarrh and asthma.
All our readers should have one of these
remarkable Cabinets. The price is won-
derfully low. Cabinet complete, with
Heater, formulas and directions, only $5.
Head steamer, $1 extra. And it is indeed
difficult to imagine where one could in-
vest that amount of money in anything
else that guarantees so much genuine
health, strength and vigor. _ -*v v
Write to-day to the World Mfg. Co.,
710 World Building, Cincinnati. Ohio, for
full information; or, better still, order a
Cabinet. You won't be disappointed, as
the makers guarantee every Cabinet, and
will refund your money after thirty days
if not just as represented. We know them
to -be perfectly reliable. Capital $100,000,
and they will ship promptly upon receipt
of remittance.
Don't fail to send for booklet anyway.
This Cabinet is a wonderful seller for
agents, and the firm offers special in-
ducements to both men and women upon
request, and to our knowledge many are
making from $100 to $150 per month and
exposes. It is certainly an opportunity
not to be neglected.

THE JEFFERSON BANQUETS.
DEMOCRACY has this year celebrated the
birthday of Jefferson with many banquets, two
of which are notable one at New York,
where Tammany feasted the gold wing of the party
in the Metropolitan Opera-house at $10 a plate amid
a profusion of flowers with a glorious galaxy of ladies
f â¢-^ r _ | -'~ V ''*l__a__^K_____^gM---M---F~y________M^W-g
looking on, and one at Milwaukee, where Colonel
Bryan turned loose the exuberance of his rhetoric
and young Carter Harrison declared himself a
Bryanite.
Doubtless the banquets were enjoyed by those who
ok part in them, but the oratory at each fell far
short of public expectation. Not one of the speakers
made clear an avenue by which Democracy can es
cape from the confusion in which it is involved, nor
uttered a fence which can serve as a rallying cry
for the disorganized hosts.
The only fact revealed by the speeches of the rival
banquets is that the Bryanites have in a much
higher degree than their opponents the courage of
their convictions. They know what they wish, and
are not afraid to declare it. Bryan was as outspoken
as ever in reaffirming his devotion to the Chicago
platform, while no speaker at the New York gather
ing was emphatic in condemning it. The motto of
the Bryanites seems to be "free silver or nothing,"
while that of the Tammany group is "anything for
victory."
On the questions arising out of the war with Spain
the division between the two was as marked as on
that of the monetary standard, and here also the ut
terances at Milwaukee were much clearer and more
decided than those at New York. Bryan plainly de
nounced expansion, while in New York the speakers
contented themselves with eulogizing Jefferson's ac
complishment in the .say of expansion, and only by
that sort of indirection gave approval to the imperial
ism they favor but dare not openly avow.
The speeches which are likely to attract most at
tention are those of Carter Harrison at Milwaukee
and of Robert B. Roosevelt at New York. They pre
sent in a striking way the decision which prevails in
the Western camp and the doubt and hesitation that
pervade the Democracy of the East. Harrison de
clared the example had been set for Democracy in
the person of its national leader, whom he described
as one "of private life so stainless, with a personal
character so blameless, that the people followed him,
and follow him still, with the zeal of Crusaders."
Very different was the tone of Roosevelt. Democ
racy, he said, "is looking earnestly for the leader who
.'.ill give expression to its principles and guide it
once more on the road to the success which it de
serves. There never was a time when a great party
so needed a great leader. It has been said that the
man always rises to meet the occasion. Here is the
occasion; where is the man?"
Such is the contrast between the two factions of
Democracy as presented at the Jefferson banquets.
One faction has its platform and its leader and sup
ports both without hesitation. The other is groping
in the darkness and, full of doubt and dismay, calls
for a leader and wonders from what direction he will
come.
A dispatch received last night from Los Angeles
reads: "Sacramento air and water have not worked
wonders for Governor Henry T. Gage. He has
malaria in his system as a gift for three months' atten
tion to duty." This news will come as a surprise to
the people of Sacramento, who never suspected, as
they watched the Governor suck wine through a
straw, that he was man of the people enough to drink
water.
Some people say that Gage will not make a very
popular Governor for the very good reason that he
has. no personal magnetism. That may be so, but
really there are some hopes for a man that had
enough of the occult power to draw after him a band
of sheep from Siskiyou County to Los Angeles.
An undertaker who served in the campaign at Porto
Rico says that the embalmed beef of Uncle Sam made
him sick. As an embalmer and funeral director it
would seem that the gentleman should have found the
beef to his liking.
Isn't it possible that the nickel-in-the-slot outrage
attached to local telephones could be suppressed by
the police? It's a mere gamble any time you drop a
coin that you'll get a connection. â¢
AN IRRITABLE GOVERNMENT.
THE predominant characteristic of the present
State administration is personal , irritability.
Eyery time a newspaper man presumes to ad
dress Governor Gage upon a subject which interests
the people, whose servant he is supposed to be, that
; individual flies into a passion and roundly denounces
i everybody within a radius of several miles. The Gov
ernor's favorite game is the press, and he never
! neglects an opportunity to express his contempt for
j newspapers, newspaper men, newspaper methods and
j newspaper morals. We have already noted his con
! temptuous reference to a rumor that he contemplated
j entering the newspaper business himself. He said
I that nothing on earth would ever cause him to de
i scend to the "newspaper level" â of morality, we sup
' pose, although having already descended to the Dan
! Burns level of politics it would not seem to . be a
| precipitous path for his Excellency to travel.
This personal irritability, however, is not confined
to Governor Gage. His partner, Mr. Denis of Los
| Angeles, appears to be a splice off the same kind of a
i main brace. The other day a reporter presumed to
! ask Mr. Denis if he aspired to the position of Code
Commissioner, and this was that gentleman's cour
teous reply: "The yellow journals of this coast seem
to think I have no rights that should be respected.
They yank me out of bed, take me from my meals
j and act as if they thought I were a lackey to the peo
| pie of California or a messenger-boy to the Governor.
I am neither one nor the other â simply a citizen of
the commonwealth and not the custodian of the pri-
vate affairs of others."
We do not know how this sort of conduct is re
garded in Los Angeles, but up here it is esteemed
among polite people to be boorishness. If Mr. Gage
and Mr. Denis are representative Southern Califor
nians there is certainly occasion for the introduction
into that region of a system of polite education among
public men. There is no excuse, in fact, for any such
conduct as is being reported of these two politicians.
Mr. Denis may or may not be a candidate for Code
Commissioner. But in any event he is bound to treat
those who address him civil questions with the cour
tesy which becomes all gentlemen, in whatever walk
of life they may happen to be cast.
Of course it is no discredit to California that she is
possessed of an irritable government. Our people
are not responsible because Governor Gage does not
cultivate the manners of a gentleman nor because he
has a bad liver or a perturbed stomach. But these
little things among thoughtless people are regarded
seriously. If Mr. Denis is going to become a part of
the government, and the whole thing is to continue
to be irritable, it will be in order to call in a physi
cian and have some soothing medicine administered.
PACIFIC OCEAN CABLES.
RECENT reports from Ottawa are to the effect
that arrangements have been made for laying
an ocean cable across the ; Pacific from Van
couver to Australia. The cost of construction is to
be defrayed by the Governments of Great Britain,
Canada and the Australian colonies.- As reported, the
line is to run from Vancouver to Fanning Island, and
from that station one branch will be laid to Australia
and another to New Zealand.
The announcement of such a programme on the
part of the British will of course stimulate the United
States Government to provide an ocean cable from
San Francisco, or some adjacent point, to Hawaii and
thence westward to Japan and China. Such lines
would be of great value to the Government at this
time and of the highest value to our commerce at all
times. The laying of the Canadian cable, in fact, will
almost compel us to act promptly in providing our
selves with an Oriental line, if we expect to compete
with Great Britain for supremacy in Pacific Ocean
commerce on anything like equal terms.
Conservative and slow as the British are in many
things, they are always fairly alert in matters of com
merce, and however advantageous it may be to them
in case of war to have a cable from Canada to Aus-
tralia, it is safe to say the main motive that prompts
them in undertaking the proposed enterprise is one
springing from their conceptions of the vast value of
Pacific Ocean trade. Having strong possessions on
three sides of the vast ocean, Canada, Australia and
Hongkong, the British are preparing to make full
use of the advantage the position gives them, and
their merchants are having all the support and aid
the Government can afford.
It is certainly high time for the United States to
give serious consideration to her Pacific Ocean trade.
The Eastern States seem to regard this coast as a
sort of outlying province, facing away from the big
world of trade and industry and therefore of compara
tively little importance. It is only recently that even
the most intelligent of their people have begun to
note that the Pacific Ocean is to be the center of com
mercial activity in the future. Hence in the past our
interests have been overlooked, and as we have not
been careful to send a strong delegation to Congress
and keep it there unchanged term after term we have
not obtained from the government even what would
have been granted had we been more persistent in
urging it.
It is folly to waste on miserable wars in the Philip
pines the money and the energy which otherwise ap
plied would provide us with ocean cables to the
Orient and with a merchant marine equal to the task
of competing with that of our strongest rivals. The
true expansion for the United States is that of indus
try and commerce, and if the laying of the Canadian
cable shall have the effect of rousing our Government
to act wisely and promptly in its true interests we shall
gain more from the enterprise than the Canadians
themselves.
POTATOES IN WASHINGTON.
A STRIKING illustration of the rapidity with
which the prices of staple articles sometimes
fluctuate, even when there is no speculation to
affect the market, was given in a report from Tacoma
on Thursday concerning the rise in the prices of po
tatoes in Washington. According to the report, "po
tatoes are now bringing as much as eggs" in the
markets of that State. "People are buying them
practically by the dozen. They cost over 2 cents a
pound and arc becoming scarcer every day."
The scarcity of the potato supply and the resulting
high price is due to a combination of events -not
likely ever to occur again coincident!}'. In the first
place the gold excitement of last season caused a
large stock of potatoes to be evaporated for: 1 ;* the'
Alaskan and Klondike trade. That demand drained
the market to a considerable .extent. Then the
drought. in this State limited the production here, and
the season turned out badly for the crop ; in Washing
ton and Oregon: Thus it came about that nature and
the Klondike craze together cornered the market.
The Tacoma report says prices have advanced un
til jobbers are paying as high as $42 a ton for good
potatoes, while hardly more than six months ago bet
ter potatoes were sold in the Yakima and Walla
Walla valleys for $6 a ton. It was noted, moreover,
that whereas in past years new potatoes from Cali
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, APRIL 15, 1899.
fornia have been in the Puget Sound markets by this
time, very few have arrived so far this season. It ap
pears the potato-grower is to have his innings at last,
and for a time at any rate may indulge the feeling of
lord of the market.
We have in this case another proof of the narrow
ness of the margin that separates prosperity from
comparative destitution even in the most civilized of
countries. Humanity produces in any. one season
just about enough to carry it over until the next har
vest comes. When a bad year intervenes and a crop
fails or falls short there is trouble.
Where the means of communication and transporta
tion are easy and economical the evil resulting from
one year's failure of a crop in any particular locality is
not great, for supplies can be sent in from the out
side. But where transportation is . costly famines
occur. They were frequent in Western Europe during
the middle ages, they are common in some parts of
Russia to this day.
As the high price of potatoes in Washington proves,
even the most industrious farmers on the most fertile
lands may sometimes fail to produce enough to feed
the population dependent on them. It is certainly
strange, however, that the Pacific Coast States, the
most productive section of the Union, should have
reached a point where in one important center of its
population potatoes are worth as much as eggs.
THE ELECTION OF SENATORS.
ON the day the Pennsylvania Legislature com
pleted the fourth month of its session it was
noted that during that time it had passed but
three bills. These bills, moreover, were not of a
nature to occupy much time. There was no filibus
tering to prevent the passage of any of them. Had j
the Legislature been so disposed, all of them might !
have been dealt with within a week and other meas- j
ures taken up.
The fact is the Pennsylvania legislators have been I
too busy to attend to business. As all the world j
knows, they have had a Senatorial fight on hand all j
winter, and it remains unfinished to this time. In
despair of being able to elect a Senator or doing any- j
thing else, the Legislature recently adopted a resolu- â 
tion providing for the appointment of a committee j
to confer with the Legislatures of other States â¢ on I
the subject of reform in the system of electing Sena- j
tors. The committee is to report at the legislative ses- I
sion in 1901.
In taking the leadership in a movement to bring I
the issue into the domain of practical politics the
Pennsylvania Legislature has at least accomplished j
something. It is certain a strong effort will be made j
at the next session of Congress to provide for the i
election of Senators by a plurality vote of the Legis- |
latures. Such a change would be worse than what we j
have now. The popular demand is for election by di
rect vote of the people. It will take a long time of
course to accomplish the needed amendment to the '
constitution, but it will be better to take the time and
do the work thoroughly than to try any short cuts to
reform.
As the Philadelphia Inquirer says: "We believe in ;
this reform, for it would end deadlocks and bring the
question right home to the voters. Delaware, Califor
nia and Utah have not been able to choose a Senator,
and Pennsylvania apparently is to be left with only
one Senator because of the malice displayed by a ;
small minority. There is danger in such refusal to
obey the will of the majority, and the only positive
way to enforce majority rule is to refer the election of !
Senators to the popular vote of the people. .The work '
of organizing in behalf of such a desirable change
must be undertaken by some one, and it is fitting that
the Keystone State should inaugurate the move
ment." â¢
MUNICIPAL OWNERSHIP IN LONDON.
THE toiling millions of London who live between
starvation and semi-starvation have cause to look
upon the street railway employes of the great
city with feelings akin to envy. The municipality a
short time ago became the owner of the tramways,
which were placed by the County Council in the con
trol of the Highways Committee. %
The first step taken by the committee was to im
prove the condition of the men and women employed
on the lines. The Westminister Gazette in giving the
first results of this experiment in paternalism says:
The committee regards it as essential that the
wages paid by the Council should be equivalent to
the best rates paid for similar work in other parts I
of the County of London; and that the Council's
rule with regard to one day's rest in seven should i
apply to the tramway's employes. The policy of one J
day's rest In seven will necessitate the employment !
of more men, involving an Increased expenditure of '
Â£9105. Various officials obtain a rise of salaries un
der revised conditions, and the wages of the women- j
checkers are to be increased by about 15 per cent. i
Hitherto the conductors have been provided with j
uniform coats. The committee contemplate extend
ing the boon to drivers, "having regard to the ex
posure to which they are subjected," and to pro
vide both classes with uniform caps. This Involves j
an additional cost of Â£1600 per annum. Horsekeep
ers now receive from 23 shillings to 25 shillings for !
a seven-day week. The committee propose that they ;
should receive 26 shillings for a six-day week. ! .
Drivers and conductors are to have an increase of I
3 pence per day. As to profits from the municipal j
trams for the year 1899-1900. the committee make ;
this gratifying announcement: "If the whole of our j
recommendations be adopted by the Council the sum
of about Â£39,100 will, Aye anticipate, still be available
for relief of the rates."
The eyes of the good people who dwell in the city
of Detroit will watch the London experiment with
great interest; for Detroit has decided that its street
railways shall become municipal property. It is prob
able the politicians also of the Michigan town are
watching the experiment with wide-open eyes, for
municipal ownership opens up a tempting field to the
practical politicians.
j Senator Perkins took occasion at the Manufac
turers' and Producers' banquet to say some nice
things about C. P. Huntington. The suspicion is
growing that he evolved. them from his imagination.
It is safe to say, at any rate, that before making the
remarks he did not consult Mrs. Stanford or George
Crocker. *

A cablegram from Manila announces the interest
ing fact that Aguinaldo has killed seven more of his

JUDGE MOGAN DEFENDS HIMSELF.
Police Judge Mogan feels that the criticism in The Call of his course 'in
the Ingleside racetrack case is severe. inasmuch as he emphatically denies
that Jones' acquittal was due to his instructions to the jury. He objects to
being made to stand responsible for the law, as the verdict gives it, for it
Is not the law, he says, and every schoolboy ought to know It. The plea
that a man can escape responsibility for a criminal act on the ground that
he is acting as the agent or employe of another, Judge # Mogan says is ab
surd, yyyyy
In regard to the instructions, Judge Mogan says: ''In my own Instruc
tions to the jury in the Jones case I made no reference to the proposition
that a person acting as clerk or employe for a bookmaker making a bet
on a race is not amenable to the law. Under the ordinance passed by the
Board of Supervisors every person, whether employer, employe or individual,
is criminally liable if he makes such a bet. There is no doubt of that, and
there is no distinction made. Conceding that fact, it is highly improbable
that I delivered any instructions to the jury in opposition thereto.
"A defendant has the right to request the court to deliver certain in
structions, and in this case his attorney tendered twenty-four carefully
worded paragraphs. Under the law I am obliged to examine each one and
accept or reject, the same. :'. y'i ', i-f
"Most of them I rejected. I had but ten minutes during the argument
to pass upon them, and while it is possible that some carefully prepared
sentences may have crept into the charge, still I doubt it very much. I am
not and was not aware of it and positively do not recollect any such
charge."
PAYMENT OF
JURORS' FEES
To the Editor of The Callâ Dear Sir:
There is one matter in connection with
the existing statutes of our State which
in my judgment should be remedied.
At present the jurors in civil cases
are paid by the losing party in the end,
as a part of the costs. In most of the
States, particularly the Southern
States, which are now among the poor
est, there is a jury tax of a few dol
: lars in every case where suit is brought
and a jury trial can be had, and this
tax is paid whether the parties waive
! a jury trial or not. .This enables the
j poorest citizen to have a jury trial. It
l is true that if the fund arising from
I this uniform tax of a few dollars is
I not always sufficient to pay the jurors
! the balance is made up by the county.
| As a jury in many cases is essential to
! the ends of justice, and as the jury is
. j as much a necessary part of the ma
: chinery of a court of justice as the
; JUdge himself, why should a citizen be
! compelled to pay so large and onerous
; a charge as the entire jury fees any
' more than he should be compelled to
j pay a part of the salary of the Judge?
: In the United States courts the juries
i are paid by the United States Govern
i ment and not by the parties to the suit.
Why should not our Legislature relieve
1 a poor fellow having a meritorious case
: from so onerous a burden? The fact
! is that the heavy burden of jurors' fees
! and shorthand reporters' fees in ad
; vance is a substantial denial of justice
ito many worthy men. In short I be
: lieve, and many years' practice in the
courts of several of the States and in
i the United States courts has enabled
Ime to observe much in reference to
such matters, that the shorthand re
porters should be paid a decent salary
i by the county, when they officiate, and
a fixed tax of say $10 in each case,
whether he is needed or not, should be
paid by each litigant before trial of
> the case, and a jury tax of say $5 in
j all cases. In the State of Mississippi,
â¢ for instance, the jury tax in all civil
cases that can be tried by a jury is
j $3, and this method has been found for
more than fifty years to be perfectly
satisfactory. Courts of justice, in order
; to be of real service, should be within
; the reach of every man who has a just
I cause, and the excessive fees that now
have to be paid by suitors make it
Impossible for many a person to have
â  his* legal rights.
I do not wish to be understood to
have any desire to injure any one in
!my view of this matter, for I am I
strongly in favor of every officer of
court being paid a decent and fair j
â  salary, .but the whole of what is now a
1 very onerous burden should not be laid !
; upon the litigant. The State is under
j obligation to furnish all its citizens
; with access to the courts, and it should
j not shoulder off the main part of the
I expense of having such access upon tha
, litigant. H. S. FOOTE.

THE HOUSE IN
THE WOOD
To the Editor of The Callâ Sir:
A curious mistake has found its way
on the very first page of your to-day's
paper. I would like to point it out to
you, as it seems a pity to let an other
wise so well-informed and forward
paper blunder over a little matter like
this.
In speaking of the palace which will
be the seat of the future Peace Con
ference in The Hague, the. name "Huis
ten Bosch" Is translated as "House of
Wood." This should be "House In
the Wood" (forest). The preposition
"te" (ten) can never have any other
meaning but one of local definition, and
is equivalent to the German "zir." Per
haps your informant got hold of a
French guide book, in. which the palace
undoubtedly is called "La Maison au
Bois," which could have a double
meaning.
This "wood" is the pride of . The
Hague and of Western Holland, where
trees of any size are rare. It is one of
the three remnants of an extensive
forest, which once covered the coast
line. The other two are near Haarlem
and Alhmaar, and called in variance
"Hout," or "Den Hout" ("Holz" in
German).
"Het Huis ten Bosch" has almost
passed into oblivion since the death of
Queen Sophy, the late King's first wife.
It was the favorite residence of this
highly Intellectual woman, her "refuge"
when the frequent society of her not
very intellectual husband proved too
much for her power of endurance.
Yours very truly,
J. VAN DEN BROCK.

SHOWER OF BITUMEN
FROM A CLEAR SKY
PECULIAR ACCIDENT AT MAR-
KET AND WALLER.
Cover to a Cooking Cauldron Blows
Off, Thickly Covering the Vicinity
With the Hot Stuff.
People in the vicinity of Market, Waller
and Octavia streets about 12:30 o:clock
yesterday were startled by a loud explo
sion, and before they could locate its
source they witnessed the phenomenon of
a shower of nice, soft, well-cooked bit
umen descending from a cloudLess sky.
It was not a mere sprinkle of the black,
pasty stuff, but a veritable deluge, that
covered streets and buildings for a dis
tance of many feet around.
The unusual occurrence was not long a
mystery. At the intersection of the three
streets named the Union Paving Contract
ing Company, which Is paving Market
street from Valencia to Fourteenth, had
placed its apparatus for cooking the
bitumen. This consisted of an immense
boiler on one truck and an Iron cauldron
(or kettle as it is termed), into which the
raw bitumen is dumped and cooked by
means of steam Injected from the boiler
alongside. The top of the kettle is closed
by a big cast iron cover, when the re
ceptacle is full, the cover being fastened
down to prevent the escape of steam.
The kettle had been refilled just before
the noon hour and the cover fastened
down and steam turned on, so that it
could cook while the men were at dinner.
Most of the workmen had gone home for
their meal, but four or five who were in
charge of the boiler and kettle remained
at the works and were eating their lunch,
being seated near the kettle. The steam
gradually crept up until the pressure is
said to have registered 350 pounds.
Suddenly there was a faint rumbling,
followed by a terrific explosion, and the
cover of the kettle went sailing high into
the air, together with the bitumen. The
kettle was scooped out clean by the es
caping steam. The black mass shot fully
100 feet into the air, and the workmen
hardly had time to get on to their feet
before it descended upon them. Their
coats and hats protected them from being
seriously burned, but they spent the re
mainder of the noon hour scraping bitu
men from their backs.
An Iron wheelbarrow, loaded with shov
els, was standing about fifteen feet away,
and Into that the heavy cover fell with a
crash, completely demolishing the imple
ments. The streets and sidewalks were
thickly covered with the bitumen, while
the nearest buildings were a sight.
The foreman stated that such explo
sions are not infrequent and are due to
flaws in the covers, which cannot be de
tected, but sooner or later yield to the
great pressure. The broken cover yester
day showed such a flaw, and It Is remark
able that it stood the strain as long as It
did. The explosion stopped work for the
remainder of the day.

A HEARING WILL
BE GIVEN THE
GAS COMPANIES
Fixing of Rates Again
Deferred.
OPINION BY AN ATTORNEY
RIGHT OF THE BOARD TO ACT
DENIED.
Supervisors Will Give the Monopoly
an Opportunity to Show Why
Present Rates Should Not
Be Reduced.
The gas companies are to be given an
opportunity to show why the present rate
of $1 75 a thousand feet now paid by the
city should not be reduced in accordance
with the expressed desire of a majority
of the members of the Board of Super
visors. In the meantime the board will
defer action in the matter of fixing the
rate to be paid for gas during the com
ing fiscal year. ,;..'â ;
The Street Lights Committee, of which
Supervisor Kalben is chairman, met
yesterday morning for the purpose of
taking action on the amended resolution
referred to it at the last meeting of the
Board of Supervisors. The original reso
lution, of which Supervisor Aigeltinger
Is the author, provides for the fixing of
the rate to be paid for gas at ?1 50 a
thousand feet. To this Supervisor Lack
mann offered an amendment fixing the
rate at $1 35 a thousand feet.
Attorney Edward Rix, representing the
gas company, was on hand and stated to
the committee that the corporation
claimed now and had always claimed
that the Board of Supervisors had no le
gal power to fix the rate to be paid for
gas. He added that if the board assumed
the power and the right to do so its ac
tion, presuming that a rate was fixed,
would not be upheld by the courts unless
an. opportunity was first given the gas
company to show what would be a
fair and equitable rate. This, he said,
had been well established in the case of
the Spring Valley Water Company, where
it was held by the Supreme Court that
the water rate fixed .by the Board
of Supervisors was void because the
water company had not been given a
full opportunity to show what a fair rate
should be. He therefore asked that if
a reduction in the gas rates was in con
templation the company be given a hear
ing and a fair opportunity to show what
rate should be charged in order that the
Interests of all parties should be pro
tected. In making this request, he said,
he did not in any way recede from the
position taken by his clients that the
board had no legal right to fix the rate
in any event.
Supervisor Aigeltinger wanted to know
if the gas company would voluntarily ac
cede to a rate of $1 50 a thousand feet.
Attorney Rix replied that no formal ac
tion of this kind on the part of the cor
poration could be taken without the con
sent of the board of directors. This
would necessitate the calling of a meet
ing of the board of directors, a proceed
ing that could not be accomplished within
less than three or four days.
After some further discussion the com
mittee decided to defer further consid
eration of the matter until next Tues
day morning at 11 o'clock, at which time
the representatives of all the .gas com
panies are to be notified to be present
for the purpose of showing why the pres
ent rate paid for gas should not ; be re
duced. ______________________

The Street Committee of the Board of
Supervisors met in special session last
night and took the first definite step
toward the advancement of the park pan
handle extension and the Mission sewer
movements. Two expert committees were
appointedâ one to appraise the value of
:he property within the limits of the pro
posed panhandle extension and the other j
to estimate the cost of a new and com- j
plete sewer system for the outlying dis
tricts. After Supervisor Aigeltinger called
the committee to order he stated that ;
the members of the committee had fully j
rliscussed th? proposed action and . had
informally agreed to appoint G. H. I'mb- I

value of the real estate and improvements
In the tract. , , ,
Supervisor Aigeltinger's list was quickly
ratified, and then he presented another
list, naming three expert engineers to
.stimate the cost of a new sewer system.
rhey were G. E. Grunsky; Marsden Man
son "and City Surveyor Tllton. Supervisor
Holland brought up the question of comp
ensation. It was the work of only a
few moments to settle this point. Super
visor Holland suggested that the fee to
be paid every member of both, appraising
committees be fixed at $500, and the sug
gestion met with the approval of every
member of the committee.
The appraisers were instructed to have
their report to the Hoard of Supervisors
in readiness by May 16. This will give the
committees ample me to fully investi
gate both matters, but it will be neces
sary for them to commence their labors
at "once. _, _ . t . _i_
When their estimates are filed with the
clerk of the board the Supervisors will
then set a date on which to hold the

board will iix a date during the months
of July or September.
JUSTICE AND NOT
CHIVALRY PREVAILS
.CHARGES AGAINST JOHN PLUN
KETT DISMISSED.
Mrs. Samuels Struck Him First and
the Insurance Man in His Ex
citement Hit Back.
Judge Mogan yesterday dismissed the
charge of battery preferred against John
Plunk general manager of the Perm
Mutual Life Insurance Company, by Mrs.
Rebecca Samuels.
The Judge briefly reviewed the case and ;
said the testimony showed that Mrs. Sam
uels had truck Plunkett first, and that |
"when a woman fights she unsexes her
self." Plunkett's demeanor while on the
â witness stand had Impressed the Judge as
that of a highly nervous man. and he
came to the inclusion that Mrs. Sam
uels' blow excited the Insurance agent, j
who in his nervousness struck back. The i
only censure Judge Mogan had for Plun
kett was conveyed In the Judge's reflec- I
tion that he considered Plunkett very \
â¢forward."
Mrs. Samuels had Plunkett arrested on
the ith of April on a charge of battery,
claiming thai she was visiting at the home ;
of her grandmother when Plunkett en- :
tered and began to abuse her. His lan
guage maddened the lady and she slapped j
his face. The alleged blow for which the
arrest was made was, in the opinion of
the court, in defense of the lady's .-mack.

I What a Little Faith Did I
FOR MRS. ROCKWELL.
[LETTER TO MRS. PINKHAM NO. 69,884]
" I was a great sufferer from female
weakness and had no strength. It was
impossible for me to attend to my
household duties. I had tried every-
thing and many doctors, but found no
relief.
My sister advised me to try Lydia
E. Pink-lam's Vegetable Compound,
which I did; before using all of one
bottle I felt better. I kept on with it
and to my great surprise I am cured.
All who suffer from female complaints
should give it a trial." â Mrs. Rock-
well, 1209 S. Division St., Grand
Sapids, Mien.
I rom a Grateful Newark Woman.
When I wrote to you I was very
sick, had not been well for two years.
The doctors did not seem to help me,
and one said I could not live three
months. I had womb trouble, falling, :
ulcers, kidney and bladder trouble.
There seemed to be such a drawing
and burning pain in my bowels that I
could not rest anywhere. After using
Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Com-
pound and Sanative Wash and follow-
ing your advice, I feel well again and
stronger than ever. My bowels feel as if
they had been made over new. With
many thanks for your help, I remain,

ACCIDENTALLY
RAUER MET A
FIGHTING QUINN
Collected Bad Eyes
Instead of Money.
HOT TIME ON A FERRY BOAT
THE LAW AGENCY PROPRIETOR
WAS TWICE TWISTED.
Had the Wrong Man in Court and
Then Found the Right One to
i the Detriment of His
Complexion.
J. J. Raver, collector of bad debts and |
the proprietor of a Sansome-street land
agency, is at present of the opinion that
there are in existence Quinns and Quinns.
But a few days ago Mr. Raver was
given permission to collect a bill from
"Jack"- Quinn, who has the reputation of
being a horse judge; but a surprise awaited
him In two ways. First he launched a
net which dragged an unoffending Quinn
into court, who proved that he was out â 
of debt and necessarily the wrong man. '
Secondly, the collector, devoid of mal- I
ice aforethought, met the correct Quinn ]
and was soon afterward obliged to paint I
his eyebrows and otherwise patch up a j
countenance formerly devoid of bloody j
marks or scars.
The story which led to the arrest of an j
innocent man, the meeting of the col
lector with the indebted Quinn and the ;
blood which has been washed from the
decks of a Tiburon ferry-boat have been j
a sort of a center for comment ln collec
tion agency circles, and the police may
be appealed to. ..'*'..
As the story goes, Mr. Raver took the I
Tlburon ferry-boat at 3:30 o'clock Thurs
day afternoon with the object in view of
visiting Santa Rosa on a collecting tour.
"While peaceably purchasing his ticket he
noticed the long-sought Quinn going on i
board the boat. Then and there he deter
mined, court or no court, to collect the j
bill due his employer. Chagrined at hav
ing hauled a wrong Quinn into court he
awaited his chance. It soon came, and
no sooner had It come than the collector
regretted his haste and departed to the
saloon on the boat to purchase bandages ,
and stimulants. -. * ;
Eye-witnesses agree that though beau- i
tiful from a crimson standpoint the mix
up was decldely one-sided and involved |
but one knockout, scored by Quinn. \
Thursday afternoon, Mr. Quinn, well |
known by all racetrack followers, left this
city, accompanied by Mr. Stelzner, gen- !
erally known to boxing enthusiasts. They
had determined to take the Tiburon ferry
on a short hunting expedition, and carried
guns and ammunition garore. Soon after |
going aboard the boat they met Mr. j
Raver. Then the exhibition opened..
Quinn saw Raver approaching and made
a sort of a gun rack and ammunition
holder of Stelzner. The pugilist, not
knowing what was to happen, held his
place. Soon the men met. A right, a left
then a repetition of the movements, and
Raver, seeking shelter, was soon .lost to I
view. Stelzner coming out of a tempo
rary trance, dropped his shooting appar- j
atus and anxiously requested to be al- j
lowed to continue the performance, but I
was prevented from doing so by friends. j
Later the hunters regretted their actions
owing to the patched up condition of the |
Injured collector.
Mr. Raver may resume business in a
few days, but It is said that he has been
quietly advised to drop Mr. Quinn from i
his list. Stelzner anxiously awaits a re- |
newal of hostilities, as It is said neither he
nor Mr. Quinn could hit a barn, let alone
a duck, owing to nervousness and other
things contracted on the trip across the
bay.
On the following day Bauer returned ,
from Santa Rosa and swore out a war
rant before Justice Rodden of San Rafael
charging Quinn with battery. He desired
a warrant for assault with intent to com- j
mit murder, but it was refused. Quinn's '
ball was fixed at $200, and Deputy Con- :
stable George At.no came to San Fran-
Cisco after him, but failed to find Quinn. j
He was Informed, however, that the turf
man would appear for trial. Raver de
clared Quinn used brass knuckles and j
said the assault was the result of an In
effectual attempt to collect a bill due the
Baldwin Hotel, for which Quinn was re
cently brought into court on an order of
examination regarding certain property.
MARINE FIREMEN'S FUNDS.
Ex-Treasurer Dougherty's Examina
tion on the Charge of Embez
zlement.
The preliminary examination of John
Dougherty, 'ex-treasurer of the Marine
Firemen's Union, on the charge of felony
embezzlement was commenced before
Judge Conlan yesterday afternoon. He
was defended by ex-Judge Fefiral.
Patrick Rodgers, ex-financial secretary
of the union, testified to having given
Dougherty the $1100-alleged to have been
embezzle-, and to obtaining Dougherty's
receipt for the money. Andrew Ryul. the
present financial secretary, testified to
having made a formal demand upon
Dougherty for the return of the money.
As the other witnesses for the prosecu
tion were not present, B. O. Young, an ex
pert on handwriting, was put on the stand
and testified that the signature on the re
ceipt for the money was not in bis opin
ion in the defendant's handwriting. The
case was continued till Monday.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, APRIL 15, 899.
FRIENDS OF
THE MINISTER
LOUDLY PROTEST
Dr. Cooke's Resigna
tion Causes a Storm.
THE CONGREGATION DIVIDED
SOME THREATEN TO GIVE "UP
THEIR PEWS.
The Minister Has Not as Yet Pre
sented His Requested Resig
nation to the Vestry of
the Church.
Chaos reigns among the congregation
of the Trinity Episcopal Church. The ac
tion of -the vestry in requesting the Rev.
Henry E. Cooke to resign the rectorship
of the church has divided the congrega
tion into two factions and a merry war
is on. The friends of the minister are
highly incensed over the vestry's action
and many of them have already given up
their pews.
One of the ladies who maintains a lofty
position ln the affairs of the church Is
the authority for the statement that the
friends of the Rev. Mr. Cooke have been
seriously thinking of calling an indigna
tion meeting to protest against his resig
nation and the vestry's request that it
should be forthcoming. Services will be
held in the church on Monday evening
and should the supporters of the minis
ter decide to make an open protest
against the vestry's action in all proba
bility the matter will be brought to a
focus there and then.
There seems to be little or nothing pro
or con in the squabble that borders on
scandal. Though the members of the ves
try are reluctant to discuss their action
or divulge the reasons which prompted
them to request their minister to pre
sent his resignation, the facts are gener
ally known.
Ever since the Rev. Mr. Cooke assumed
the responsibility of the pulpit and af
fairs of the Trinity Episcopal Church
there has been more or less opposition to
his course on the part of the vestry and
many other prominent and wealthy mem
bers of the congregation. On the other
hand, the reverend gentleman succeeded
in winning the admiration and hearty
support of many of the workers of the
parish. This divided the congregation
into two factions.
One of the vestry in defending. their ac
tion to a friend stated that during the
last year there has been a vast falling
off in the attendance at the church and ;
a decrease In the yearly receipts of sev
eral thousand dollars. This, he claimed,
was due to the Rev. Mr. Cooke's sermons
and voice, which, he claimed, was weak
and wholly inadequate to fill the church.
Other modern Ideas which the minister
Introduced Into the services were dis
tasteful to the vestry, so they claim, and
for that reason they decided to request
his resignation.
The minister still refuses to discuss the
situation, but his friends are all garru
lously indignant, and some of them have
gone so far as to vow that they would
never again enter the doors of Trinity-
Church Tf Dr. Cooke's resignation is ac
cepted by the vestry.
--"If they do not rescind their action I
will never put my foot Inside the church
doors again." said a prominent and
wealthy woman who has been an active
church worker for years. "The Rev. Mr.
Cooke has worked heart and soul to make
matters run along smoothly, and nobody
could entertain any just criticisms to his
course. These matters, however, are del
icate and private affairs and I do not feel
at liberty to discuss them too "freely."
Many friends of Dr. Cooke are Inclined
to believe that social affairs may have
fa id a potent bearing on the vestry's ac
tion. While Dr. Cooke is a member of
a family whose social sway in the East
was never questioned, the minister did
not cater particularly to the bright satel 7
lltes of local society who happened to be
members of his flock. These who have
arrayed themselves on the side of the
minister state that during his regime Dr.
Cooke assisted more than one lowly mem
ber of his flock to a position in church
affairs where they could rub shoulders
with the elite.
This is believed to have promulgated a
feeling of opposition among a certain
class, and the friends of Dr. Cooke are
responsible for the belief that it played no
small part in the present trouble.
POWER OF SUPERVISORS.
They May Open or Close Streets at
â¢l .; Their Pleasure.
The Supreme Court In a decision hand
ed down yesterday has upheld the action
of the Board of Supervisors In the matter
; of closing the westerly end of Turk street.
; This thoroughfare as originally laid out
between Masonic and St. Josephs aye
( nues was 100 feet wide. In April, 1897, the
board passed an order declaring the
northerly 31 feet 3 Inches to be closed and
vacated. Several owners of land abutting
on the southerly side of Turk street in
stituted proceedings with a view of hav
ing the action of the board rescinded and
a judgment annulling said order, upon the
ground that the board had acted in ex
cess of its Jurisdiction.
They had asserted that they had been
damaged by the closing of the street, and
that the order complained of did not pro
vide for any compensation for such dam
ages. A demurrer to the application was
sustained fey the Superior Court, from
which an appeal was taken. The Su
preme Court says: .< '
"The act of the Board of Supervisors in
determining that a street shall be opened
or closed, or widened or contracted, or
otherwise improved, is a legislative act
performed in the exercise of the power
which has been conferred upon the mu
nicipality by the Legislature to enable it
to provide for the welfare of Its citizens,
and although the board is called upon to
exercise its judgment in determining
whether to authorize the improvement,
such judgment is not the exercise of any
'judicial function,' but Is the conclusion
which they form in the exercise of the
discretionary power that has been in
trusted to them, and upon a consideration
of the public welfare and demands for
which they are to provide."

Last evening the Caledonian Club held an

NOE VALLEY
TERRORIZED
BY TOUGHS
Police Appear to Be
Powerless. ' '
DEPREDATIONS OF HOODLUMS
LIVES AND PROPERTY ARE IN
JEOPARDY.
Long List of Outrages Heaped Upon
a Helpless Family, While the
Authorities Afford No
Protection.
For several years the residents of Noe
Valley have been terrorized by the depre
dations of a gang of hoodlums, and the
police, though fully cognizant of the ex
istence of the gang and the names of
most if not all the members, are either
powerless or unwilling to suppress the
marauders. Affairs have reached such a
stage that persons are openly attacked
with even harder treatment it' they dare
lodge complaint against the offenders.
The members of the gang range in age
from 12 to 26 years, and they have dis
played extraordinary ingenuity in devis
ing methods of destroying the peace and
property of the people in the neighbor
hood.
Few have escaped the attentions of this
gang, but one of the greatest sufferers
Is David Fleischman, a simple-minded
huckster and junk dealer, who lives with
his father, mother and sister at 111 Jersey
street. The elder Fleischman is 90 years
old, totally blind and entirely helpless.
The mother is but a few years younger,
bent nearly double with weight of years,
while the sister Is a cripple. This family
own the little cottage they live in, and
as the son has been in too feeble health
for almost a year to follow his ordinary
occupation, they depend entirely upon a
cow and a few chickens for their exist
ence. But the hoodlums seem determined
to cut off even this source of revenue, for
within the pas\ three weeks they have
brought into service a parlor rifle, with
which they practice on the Fleischman
poultry with deadly effect. A few days
ago the cow was shot and suffered from
the wound for several days. Two dogs
owned by the family have been shot and
repeatedly stoned; a pet cat and her kit
tens killed and the members of the family
themselves boldly threatened with exter
mination, j
The ringleaders of the gang are three
brothers named Grove, a fellow named
Singewold and two Smith brothers, all of
whom live in the vicinity of Twenty
fourth and Sanchez streets. They have
repeatedly set upon Fleischman, stoned
him, and threatened him with death. One
day, when Fleischman had his cow up on
the hillside grazing, he was set upon by
hoodlums and severely stoned, the animal
being cut with the missiles as well. Since
then he has not dared to take the cow
out to graze, and his mother and sister
are compelled to go out and cut grass,
bringing it to the stable in sacks.
But that is only a tithe of what the
family has suffered. One night, some
months ago, the old lady was in the kit
chen, when a rock weighing over a pound
crashed through the window and struck a
shelf within a few inches of her head. At
another time the family was seated at the
supper table, when another huge rock
sailed through the window, carrying away
part of the blind and upsetting the lamp.
Fortunately it was of metal and did not
break, else the house would have been
destroyed.
The night of the 3d of last July Fleisch
man saw several of the gang ln the yard
near his front door, and thinking they
were stealing some i flags he had tacked
up .over the windows that day, decided
it would be better not to interfere with
them. .A minute later there was a ter
rific explosion, shattering the front door,
shaking the house like an earthquake
and badly damaging the walls. The
young fiends had filled a piece of gas pipe,
on one end of which was an iron cap,
with powder, and plugging up the other
end fired it with a fuse close up against
the door. Fleischman has the shattered
infernal machine now as an exhibit of
their desperation.
â¢ Time and again the house has been sub
jected to a bombardment of rocks, marks
of which are plainly seen. The family Is
afraid to show a lamp at a window at
night for fear of it being used as a tar
get.
Worst of all, the company which had
insured the Fleischman house learned of
the bombardment and explosion and can
celed the policy. Since then Fleischman
has only been able to insure the place for
a trifling amount, and that at an exor
bitant rate. .
A favorite amusement of the gang is to
drop a huge bowlder on a brood of tiny
chickens, Just to see how many they can
kill and maim. One night not long ago
Fleischman saw four of the gang, all full
grown, sneak into his barn, and the fam
ily remained awake all night, expecting
momentarily that the place would break
into flame. - The following morning they
found that the cow had been milked dry
by the toughs and their revenue for that
day shut off.
Fleischman and others have reported
the gang to the police times innumera
ble, and officers have been sent out to
Investigate, but never an arrest Is made.
About two years ago Fleischman says he
went down to get a warrant for the Grove
brothers, but the prosecuting attorney to
whom he applied said it would cost him
$10 to procure the warrant and have the
case prosecuted. Fleischman would not
be bled, and the warrant was not Issued,
Hi- does not know the name of the prose
cuting attorney who tried to hold him
up.
Since the hoodlums have brought the
rifle Into use, Fleischman, fearing that
his entire flock of chickens would be de
stroyed, and knowing that it was useless
to expect any protection from the police,
told his troubles to Secretary Holbrook
of the Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Animals, and that officer is
conducting a thorough Investigation. He
has the names of the gang, young and
old, and expects to have ample evidence
against them in a few days to secure
the conviction of the entire crowd.

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, April Trading was rather
sluggish most of the day, transactions only
sllghtly exceeding half a million shares. Lo
cal transportation shares continued prominent
In the dealings, while the railroads moved with
in narrow limits. The idea that Brooklyn
Transit might benefit by some of the mooted
electrical combinations made the stock in keen
request. The stock sold ex the subscription
rights from 129 to 134%, closing at 134, against
last gin's 130. Manhattan, too, ran up some
3 points, while Metropolitan, after an early
display of strength, broke 7 points, closing with
a net loss of 3. Among other strong specialties i
were Sugar, People's Gas, Continental To
bacco, Federal Steel, Rubber and Lead. The
two last named rose 3 and 5 respectively. The
railway list, although neglected most of the
day, was strong in the late dealings. Influ
ences at work on sentiment were easy money,
hopes of a favorable bank statement to-mor
row and rather better reports on wheat. Mo
bile and Ohio advanced on small dealings on
the belief that a deal was pending which would
serve the read an entrance to Chicago over
the St Louis Short Line. A number of brok
ers have requested large time loans so as not
to be forced to pay high rates for call loans ln
any possible squeeze In money.. Transactions
for foreign account were very small. In the
final dealings the pressure against traction
stocks caused some recessions from the best
prices, but the undertone was good.
To-day's bond market showed good breadth
and there were some good gains in issues which
have of late obtained prominence in the market.

THE LONDON MARKET.
NEW YORK, April 14.â Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram says: The
markets here were mainly occupied to-day in
discussing the effect of the new stamp duties.
It is thought they bear unduly on Americans
generally, owing to the practice of frequently
renewing scrip certificates, and particularly on
low-priced shares, the tax being on the nom
inal value. Arbitrage business also suffers at
Amsterdam particularly.
Americans were dull at parity until New
York bought. The close was at the best, but
there were losses on the day.
Money was easier. The bank repaid its bor
rowings. Eighty-one thousand pounds sterling
gold ln bars was bought by the bank.

BRADSTREET' FINANCIAL REVIEW.
NEW YORK, April 14.â Bradstreefs finan
cial review to-morrow will say: This week has
witnessed another remarkable exhibition of the
force and strength of the present bullish specu
lative temper. The heavy declines and liqui
dation of Industrial securities, accompanying
the rise in call loan rates and the Increased
disposition of tenders to reject "trust" stocks
or high-priced . specialties as collateral, was
apparently checked last Saturday by the ap
pearance of only a moderately unfavorable
bank statement and by the evident disposition
of large interests in the market to support the
railroad share list. On Monday the day for
call loans eased off to a notable extent, the
rates of money for call showing an increase,
and though the bulk of the loans were made at
6 per cent, money was freely offered before the
close at 4 per cent or less. It would seem that
the interests which had- charge of the money
gathered for the Chicago and Alton syn
dicate, the Manhattan stock subscriptions
and other large stocks took steps to release
their funds. A number of strong loans were
also made and the money market as a whole
failed to present the alarming symptoms which
have furnished grounds for the break which
came later in the week. Although the dis
crimination against industrials continued, it
was thought that it was not so severe or gen
eral. â  The street at large was Inclined to the
belief that the liquidation In industrials was a
putty process and has checked disposition of
the public to trade In such securities on In
sufficient margins and of a certain proportion
of brokerage firms to carry unduly large i
amounts of those stocks for speculative ac
counts. Yet, In spite of the prevalent idea that
the market when It regained its tone and ac
tivity would turn to the railroad share list
rather than to the industrials and specialties,
the latter portion of the market has shown a
remarkable resumption of its strength and ac
tivity and developed renewed public buying,
which it is however hoped will be conducted
upon a more conservative basis. The railroad
stock list was naturally the first to recover
from the depression. Evidences of effective
support from large Interests In New York Cen
tral, Big Four and other Vanderbilt securities
werq the most prominent features of the market
on Monday. The Pacific stocks also advanced
and there were bullish demonstrations in Mis
souri Pacific and other lower priced railroad
shares later on. Neither the Samoan trouble
nor the bad Government crop report had much
effect, though the latter incident accompanied
as it was by a sharp advance In the grain mar
ket and additional tales of damage to winter
wheat held the Granger and Southwestern
stocks back. - Renewed advances in the stocks
of the Flower group, such as Brooklyn Rapid
Transit. People s Gas and Federal Steel, fol
lowed by displays of strength in Ameri
can , Tobacco, ' Continental Tobacco â  and

ones which are still traded In on the outside
market. recovering a large part, of their pre
vious declines. Manipulation was "very, appar-.

showed an unexpected revival, and London
while doing little here, was in the main a pur

sentiment on the other side is held in check by
expectations of high money as the season ad

BRADSTREETS ON TRADE CONDITIONS.
NEW YORK. April 14.â Bradstreefs to-mor
row will say: Real spring weather 'has Im
proved the ' tone of trade, particularly retail,
and correspondingly helped Jobbing distribution,
but at the same time brought last winter's In- i
Jury to the winter crop more ln evidence. The j
regular monthly Government crop report proved ;
rather more favorable than expected. fore- j
THE SAN FEANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, APRIL 15, 1899.
shadowing, on the basis of last fall's largely
Increased acreage, a yield little below that of
last season. The unanimity â â  of later damage
reports would seem to point to full information
regarding the crop not being obtainable at the
date when the Government advices were gath
ered. The indifference with which the Gov
ernment crop report was received has appar
ently been shaded into the belief that damage
has been done, - and wheat prices for the first
time this season may be said this week to have
actually reflected crop damage reports.
Other cereals are but little changed, while
the movement of our breadstuffs ' abroad at
present seems to be on a lessening scale. Among
the favorable features coming to light this
week might be mentioned the receipt of con
tinued good railroad earnings reports, advices
of widespread industrial activity, accompanied
by rather less than usual friction, as reflected
in strikes for higher wages', and a largely im
proved distribution of wool, which appears to
have awakened at last from its long sleep. Sales
of this staple. Indeed, are the heaviest reported
for many years past, both inside and out
side combinations having bought freely of
territory and other domestic grades. Large
quantities of wool, however, have been bought
for re-export, English- buyers bidding freely
for high-grade Australian sorts. The strength
of raw sugar has â¢ finally been reflected in
higher rates for refined, hard grades of which
are firm at the advance, while soft grades have
been shaded. Indications are that the Cuban
crop will be smaller than last year, and the
weather in Louisiana Is reported still unfavor
able to plant -growth. Advices from the manu
facturing Jvwelry trade are in a high degree
favorable, some estimates pointing to 25 per
cent more business being done this spring than
a year ago, while the retail trade is of good
tone and collections improved. The iron and
steel Industry remains firm, though the tone
Of the market in general is quieter. Pigiron
production Is Increasing, but consumptive re
quirements are still urgent. The lumber mar
ket Is active at wholesale; stocks are small and
prices manifest aggressive strength. There Is
a fair demand for coal, but milder weather
tends to discourage large sales.
Current demand for dry goods at the East is
quieter, though fall orders are reported notably
good and dress woolens are In satisfactory de
mand. Boots and shoes are firm at the ad
vance made over the season's opening quota
tions.
The strength of prices in March renders com
parisons with earlier periods interesting.
Compared with a year ago the general level
of values is 8 per cent higher, while there is an
advance shown >)f nearly 40 per cent from the
low-water level of October, 1896.
Wheat, including flour, shipments for the
week aggregate 1.956.619 bushels, against 3.354,

NEW YORK, April 14.â R. G. Dun & Co.'s
weekly review of trade will say to-morrow:
There Is still an Increase in all legitimate
business and the productive power of great
industries increases even though some of their
stocks decline. The sharp reaction in specu
lation a week ago ln no way affected the
producing capacity of furnaces or mills and
has been in part recovered, while the disturb
ance of business caused by the formation of
great combinations has ln large measure
ceased. The money market is in safer and
more wholesome condition,' and in spite of four
heavy payments by large syndicates, amount
ing to about $50,000,000, has grown easier. The
only stringency has been in call loans.
It is not owing to speculation alone that
payments through the chief clearing houses
have been 80 per cent larger, than In the same
week of 1892 and 103.3 per caht larger than last
year. New York transactions far exceed those |
of any previous week, $1,468, 709 in amount, |
but outside of New York the clearings were
41.5 per cent larger than 1898. The truth is .
that no such expansion in the general busi- I
ness of the country has ever been seen before
and if such records only were considered there
would be ground for fears that a wild pas
sion of trading had again lifted the whole
business community off its feet. But instead
there Is found surprising increase in the. chief
industries. Naming first some of which only
returns of raw materials Imported give defi
nite indications, raw silk imports Increased
87 per cent for eight months of the fiscal year
over last; hides, 40 per cent; lndiarubber, 26
per cent; tin, 21 per cent, and fibers, 19 per j
cent.
The output of plgiron April 1 was 245.. 46 !
tons weekly, against 228,198 tons March 1, with
li;.. lis tons decrease In stucxs unsold and 16.600 j
tons In warrant stocks, indicating a consump- ;
tion in manufacture of 1,043,000 tons in March. i
The haste of forty other furnaces to get Into
operation, with their possible output of 30,000 |
tons more weekly, has helped to keep prices of j
plgiron quite steady, although strong, but the I
demand for finished products Is far from fat
isfactory. The Maryland Steel Company has
orders for 75,000 tons steel rails for the Chi
nese Eastern. Large contracts were closed in
structural works, one for 3000 tons, Just before
the advance in prices, but Chicago orders this
week covered 6000 tons bridgework. and every;- â 
where there is much business in sight.
Bar and sheet mills are hindered by , pros
pects it consolidation, but though few orders j
for Pars are taken 'Just now at the West,
the Philadelphia market is more steady. Steely
bars rose *_ per ton at Pittsburg, and the
heavy demand for sheets makes prices very
irregular, with many orders refused.
The Connellsville coke product. 179,163 tons
for the week, surpassed all records, and prices
are steady as before quoted. Lake copper i
strong at (18 50 and scarce, and tin went up j
with London, declinging only to 23 per cent. I
In spite of some strikes because wages were j
not' raised as much as hands expected, the i
cotton industry has a very, good demand and |
most of the mills are working satisfactorily. A j
Southern combination of fine goods, makers is |
proposed, like that of Fall River mills, which
has kept prices quite steady of late.
Woolen mills have begun to buy wool more
largely, though at prices much of their own
making, but there is improving demand for
goods, .with light weight purchases continuing |
surprising for the season. Sales or wool at |
the three markets have been 16.792,000 pounds
in two weeks, against 3,385,000 pounds last
year.
Wheat advanced about half a cent, accounts
of Injury* discovered since April 1 supplement
ing the* Government report. Were the worst
of these stories true, there is yet spring wheat
seeding to make up for deficiencies, though
the season is getting rather late. Exports have
been reduced, Atlantic flour included, amount- ,
ing to 3,960,380 bushels, for two weeks, against
5,285,198 bushels last year, and Pacific to 564,562
bushels, against 2.093,943 bushels last year, with j
other exports 806,377 bushels. \
Failures for the week have been 183 ln the
United States, against 254 last year, and 22
in Canada, against 18 last year.

. CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
.CHICAGO, April General strength abroad
and continued bad crop news - gave wheat a
strong start. May opened" %Â®%c higher at
from 75c down to 74% c, and rose to 75 %c. At
this point the market was flooded with long
wheat. For about twenty minutes, however,
there were shorts enough desirous of stopping
further loss on previous sales to absorb offer
ings, and the market held steady. The bears
took fresh courage when it became evident
that liquidation was to continue and several
short who had â  covered early â  commenced to
sell again. When â¢ both longs â  and shorts had '
wheat â¢ for i sale .at the same time It was
Impossible ' to ' find buyers enough and that
state of affairs â  resulted in a punctured boom.
The price of May. inside of an hour, dropped
t0,74%c. Short selling was encouraged by the
heavy shipments of wheat from Argentina this
week, which amounted to nearly- 3,000,000
bushels. Predictions of possible showers in
Illinois and rainy conditions in - Missouri and
Kansas also accelerated the decline. The mar
ket became very irregular over : a somewhat
narrow â¢ range during - the remainder of the
forenoon succeeding the- time of the early de
cline. . The Modern Miller declared that the
whole wheat situation showed a notable im
provement and that the advices had become
distinctly better during the week. \ On that
authority, as against all the others of differ
ent kinds, the price was attacked and forced,
a few notches lower than it went in the fore
noon. From that time the market continued
heavy. May declining to 73c, and closing at
73%@73%c. July, which sold for 75% c at the
beginning, declined to 73% c with buyers at the
close.
Trade in corn was quite active, and at the
start slightly better prices were made. : Liqui- '
dation set in, however, and the market mani
fested - considerable weakness. May corn
closed %c lower. . â¢ â -_"._. \
Oats ruled quiet within narrow limits. Fav
orable weather widened the spread between
May and July to l%@i%c. There was a good
cash demand. May oats closed %@%c lower.
Better prices at the yards and scattered out
side buying strengthened provisions. "
May pork closed 2%c higher. May lard closed
2%c higher, and May ribs 2%<g~sc higher.

Eggs have been selling rather higher during
the week, but the tendency Is now downward.
Butter stands about the same. -i,-
Poultry continues scarce and dear.. Game will
soon disappear. Meats show no change. ''J,'
Cherries are added to the list. There are not
many coming in, as most of them are going
East. A good share __Â£. the fruit will go East
this year, as the crop there has been almost
destroyed by winter weather, but there will
still be plenty for local consumption, without
doubt. Vegetables are in better supply, and
prices are rather cheaper for some kinds.

TO HIS OWN
GOOD HEALTH
Record of His Last
Examination.
ALLEGED ILLNESS DOUBTED
GRIP NOT RECOGNIZED UNDER
THE STANCES.
A Grave Point Against the Accused
That Was Robbed of Some of
Its Foree â Ac
counts.
It was another bad flay for Lion tenant
Neall at the court-martial yesterday.
tenant David J. Rumbough, adju
tant of the Third Artillery waa the prin
cipal] witness of the day. ilia testimony
tended to prove the state In which th
books of the Presidio Club were found,
and also to show that Neall might not
have been so ill as former testimony
would seem to indicate.
Rumbough was one of the committee
which investigated the accounts of the
club; Captain Danes and Lieutenant
Harris were the other members of the
committee. He said no accounts had
been kept from Apr:;. 1898, until the
time the committee investigated the
books, in February, 1899, when the secre
tary's desk was found in the greatest dis
order and among the papers were nu
merous unpaid bills and dunning letters.
One bill had been turned over to a col
lecting firm, and the standing of the club
was being injured by the state of affairs.
One of tho creditors had written to
Lieutenant Neal about the club account
and also about his own private account.
Failing .to receive any -faction he
wrote to the department commander, at
that time. General Miller, who referred
the matter to Neall through his com
manding fflcer, Lieutenant Colonel "Wag
ner, who ordered Neall to right the mat
ter and report how and when he had done
fo. The club bill was over $11.0, and
Neall's private bill was over $â¢_.. Both
had been running from July of IS9S and
nothing had been paid on either account
since that time. Eventually Neall re
duced the amount of the club bill to $300,
at which amount it stood in February
last.
Continuing Rumbough testified that he
had been recorder of the examining board
by which Neall had been examined for
promotion to _ captaincy. The examina
tion was in January. The lirst proceed
ing fore the examining board inquires
Into the mental capability of the candi
date for promotion. The,n there Is a phy
sical examination, and in tnat the candi
date is required to certify to the fact
that he is physically capable of perform
ing the duties of the office to which ne
aspires. Wall had certified to this fact, .
and this was during the time, according to
Major Edie's testimony, that he was not j
eatable of performing the duties then
allotted to him.
The force of this statement was les- !
sened, however, later on by Captain Pratt,
one of the members of the court. "Grant
ing hat a man had an attack of the grip
at the time of his examination," he asked,
"was he not justified in certifying that he
was not physically aualified?"
"My opinion Is that it would not dis
qualify him," was the answer.
"Then an officer so. affected could sign
such a certificate insisted Pratt.
"He could," admitted tha witness, and
the accused had weathered another rock,
but not without damage.
The witness also testified that he had
known the accused intimately for some ,
time, and up to the time he disappeared
he had never noticed anything the matter
with his health except a slight cold. Un
der cross-examination the witness refused
to admit that Neall's health was not of
the best.
Lieutenant Kirby Walker, at present
commanding Neall's old. troop, was the
only other witness of the day. He was
called to testify as to the state of the
hooks of the troop when he took held of
the organization, and his testimony was
mostly given in dollars and cents. He was
busy with figures all the time and was
Ftiil testifying when the court stopped
him by adjournment. He. found a total
debt of the troop of $:,?,! 72, of which ho
was able to pay something over $218.
In the Divorce Court.
Rhoda McCullough has been granted a
divorce, from Thomas H. McCullough on
the ground of desertion. David J. Thomas
has been committed to jail by Judge Hunt
for contempt of court for having refused
to obey an order directing him to pay his
wife, Blanche Thomas. $25 a month ali
mony, pending the determination of di
vorce proceedings instituted by Mrs.
Thomas. Suits for divorce have been filed
by Rowena L. Lucas against Frederick
A. Lucas, for cruelty; David Polkinhorn
against Eliza Polkinhorn, for desertion;
Anna S. Dalzell against William Dalzeil.
for desertion, and Joseph C. O'Neill
against Lizzie O'Neill for cruelty.
In the Wasp.

A Small Boy Burglar.
Robert McKay, a youngster aged 13

articles, when the officer arrested him.
After a jury had been secured the case
went over till this morning to give the

POSTUM CEREAL.
POSTUM FOOD COFFEE.
Ordinary coffee agrees perfectly with
some people and with others it does
not. It is the hidden and unsuspected
cause of numberless stubborn ails. To

in such cases: Take on Postum Cereal
Food Coffee and enjoy your hot morn-

quickly and surely rebuild the broken

THE NOOSE FOR CHAVES.
The Los Angeles Murderer to Be '
Hanged This Morning.
Manuel Chaves will be hanged to-day.
Every effort seems to have been made to
save the fellow's neck, but to no purpose.
Soon after he was sentenced in Los An
geles County for killing a woman his at
torney induced Governor Budd to grant
a reprieve that delayed the execution from
December 16 to April 15. Since there have
been efforts to Induce Governor Gage to
show some clemency to the condemned,
but these were unsuccessful.
Warden Hale, who has charge of the
details of the execution at San Quentln,
was for a time apprehensive of his duties,
and yesterday sent to the Attorney Gen
eral "an inquiry as to whether or not it
was necessary to have th". reprieved man
resentenced, Mr. Ford last evening sent
the following dispatch to the Warden,
which shows that there Is but one thing
for that offlclal to doâ hang Chaves at
the appointed hour, 10:30 clock this
morning: 'â¢ . .
"Reprieve merely postpones execution:
of Judgment to date fixed by reprieve. Re
sentence by court is not necessary unless
execution; is stayed in some manner other
than by reprieve."

BASEBALL TO-DAY.
! Watsonville and San Francisco to
Play at Recreation Park.
Manager Struve and his aggregation of
baseball talent from Watsonville ar
rived in town last night, and this after
noon the ball-tossers from the sugar
city will endeavor to recover the hon
ors they lost last week. Struve's team
I was beaten two straight by the Friscos
and both games were hotly contested.
They are going against the same team
again this week, and if they put up as
good ball as that supplied last Sunday
the local fans will have no cause for
complaint. "Fireman" Fitzpatriok and
Whelan will do the twirling to-day. and
to-morrow the two stars of the box-
Harper' and Ibergâ will be the opposing
pitchers. [berg has not been seen this
season on the local diamond, and he will
no doubt prove a strong drawing-card.

DAVID TENNY
HAS REGAINED
HIS OLD FORM
Beat Adoiph Spreck
eis in Fast Time.
CHEAP SPORT AT OAKLAND
ALL SORTS OF HORSES FINISHED
IN FRONT.
Winners Hard to Pick, and the Tal
ent Displaying Signals of Dis
tress â Heigh Ho a Live
One.
In the mile and a quarter handicap de
cided at Oakland yesterday David Tenny, j
with 113 pounds on his expansive back
and piloted by Charley Thorpe, defeated
Adoiph Spreckeis in a sharp and decisive
struggle, covering the distance in 2 :(.(."_.
Tenny came from the far rear, winning
by a length, and his performance was an
exceptionally tine one. On December "S
last Robert Bonner, a cheap selling
plater, carrying 90 pounds, was creuited
with reeling off the distance in 2:06%, the
present coast record. Considerable doubt
is cast on ibis latter run, as it is claimed
the horses beat the time flag.
A miscellaneous collection of horses
started in the different events, and win
ners were hard to guess. The edge seems
worn off the game, and the better class ;
of race-goers no longer patronize it. Long j
shots were continually dropping in tirst,
Gusto and Thyne, each 30 to 1 chances,
proving the stars.
Jinks, the lukewarm favorite for the |
first event, received a poor send-off, and â¢
although showing speed; finished among !
the "also rans." Prompto ran down the
fleet Imasa and looked to be winning,
when Johnny U. iff slipped up on the out- !
side with Heigh Ho, a . to J. shot, getting i
the verdict by over a length.
Bat-singer, the colored boy, made a nice j
sneak with Einstein in the mile and a fur- ,
long run. landing the purse. Ringmaster,
the favorite, closely followed by Cavallo,
Coda and New Moon, struck the stretch
in front of the field. Hugging the rail
With his mount and gaining half a dozen
lengths, Basslnger won easily from New
Moon. The winner closed at 6 to 1 in the
books. :_'
The Montana-bred gelding Burdoc ruled
favorite for the two-year-old scramble,
although the bulk of the coin bet went in
on Rose Queen and Catulus. The former,
a filly from the Baldwin stable, was
touted on fast workouts, closing second
choice. Catulus, ridden by Reiff, was
pounds the best, but cut-off soon after the
start, went the overland route, and, fin
ishing like a ghost, was beaten but a head I
by Gusto, a 30 to 1 shot.
A dingy, musty assortment of thorough
breds, so called, started in the mile run
for maidens. Ed Lanipai;. one of the sec
ond choices, led to the stretch and there
fell back to third place. At this juncture
Macklin, on the 30 to 1 outsider Thyne,
skimmed along, downing Catastrophe a
length in 1:41.
The mile and a furlong run was made
easy for Corrigan's Winifred, and he i
waltzed in first. Gray managed to take !
the place with Ulm, the 6 to 5 favorite.
Track Notes.
This will be the final day at Oakland of
the exiled and almost defunct Pacific
Coast Jockey Club. The fields wear a lop
side, 1 bow-wow look, and the drama
"Driven From Home" can be put down
as an ill-starred venture.
A. Nickells, the owner of Veragua, no
longer trains the horses of Prince Ponia
towski. ' '

ATTORNEY WHITE
WILL BRING SUIT
FOR EXTORTION
Says Capitalist Kelly Asked
Him for Five Hundred
Dollars.
An Actress's Loan Leads to a Sensational
Hour With Grand Jurorsâ White Said
to Have Forged.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call, j
908 Broadway. April 14.
MRS. NELLIE COLVARD, a pretty j
actress of San Francisco, came to
Oakland some months ago to raise ,
a small loan on her piano, and the |
result of her visit is an application to the i
District Attorney for a warrant for forg- J
cry against Attorney W. B. White. The
Grand Jury has inquired into the matter,
has heard the story of Mrs. Colvard, her
husband. Professor Colvard, and of At
torney White, and dropped the matter as
having no criminal intent.
A few months ago Mrs. Colvard, being
In need of $25, came over here to try to
negotiate the loan with Attorney White.
Mr. White, not being In the money-lend
ing business, made it possible for her to j
obtain the money from Cyrus B. Kelly,
a capitalist and money lender. White \
drew up a chattel mortgage on the piano |
and prepared a note, which was signed
by Mrs. Colvard and by her authority
Dnd also armed with a power of attorney j
by W. B. White for Professor Colvard.
This signature is held by Kelly to be a
forgery, and White alleges that Kelly de- I
manded $500 as the price of not sending
him to jail.
For several days Kelly was visiting the
prosecuting attorney's office and the
District Attorney's office, and also Judge
Quinn's court, asking for the issuance of
a warrant, to which he was willing to
swear, charging the attorney with forg
ery. After a few days White says he
thought it time to close up Mr. Kelly's
Importunities, and he took the precaution,
while Kelly was talking to him on one
occasion on the street, to have Constable
Ed Weidler near enough to hear the con
versation. Again Kelly said that the
whole matter would cost $500 and that
if the young attorney could not produce '
it. It would be an easy matter for his
father to do so to prevent his son from ;
being imprisoned. i
"The matter has caused me considerable
annoyance," said Attorney White this
afternoon, and it is absolutely without
merit other than the making of an error
by myself when I drew the note in not
signing it as attorney in fact, which of
course I should have done, although there
Is even a doubt as to whether this was
legally necessary- Mrs. Colvard came to
me for the loan*, and I introduced her to '
Kelly. The note was made for three i
HILBORN WHS
ANXIOUS TO
SAVE VALLEJO
Why He Advocates a
Wooden Dock.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
998 Broadway, April 14.
Ex-Congressman Hilborn shares with
Collis P. Huntington the Idea that a
wooden drydock is just as serviceable as a
stone structure. The Congressman's at
titude in favoring the construction of
Mure Island's new dock of wood has
caused a brief controversy. Mr. Hilborn
has Just sent a statement to friends here
explaining his course.
Mr. Hilborn says:
I cannot understand the outburst of in
dignation against wooden docks at the pres
ent time. About a year ago Congress
passed a hill providing for building four
drydocks, one of which wan to be built
at Mare Island, and they were all tec he of
wood. The Secretary of the Navy had the
option to build on" of Them of stone or
concrete.
No word of protest went up from '"ali
fornia over the proposition to build the Mare
Island dock of wood. Indeed, for many
years the Government has built Its docks
entirely of this material. A wooden dry
dock, if properly built, is a good dock. The
Government dock at Port Orchard Is a
wooden dock and is a good one. C. P.
Huntington Is building a dock at Newport
News which will be over 1100 feet lone and
is said to be the largest dock in the world.
It is designed for docking the largest and
heaviest vessels in the world and he is
buiMlng it of wood. There are no private
docks in the United States built ln re
cent years which are not built of timber.
My main object, however, in Insisting
that the one at Mare Island should be a
wooden dock was that a wooden dock can
be built so much quicker. Huntington ex
pects to have bis Immense dock completed
In one year from the date of its commence
ment and even the â  eminent can build a
wooden dock In two years. The present dry
dock at Maro Island is of stone and It cost
$2,M0,000, ami it took over nineteen years to
build It. The Government has never built
a stone dock In less than sis years. Vallejo
cannot afford to wait six years for a dock.
This would mean a virtual abandonment of
the Mare Island naval station and the ruin
of the city, for in thai six years all the
battleships would go to the 'lock at Port
Orchard, which would result In building up
that establishment, so that Mare Island
would take a second place. While a wooden
dock may not last as long as a stone dock,
while It does last It is as rood a* a stone
dock, If not better. What was needed at
Mare Island was a dock which could be
built quickly and would yet answer the

month. At the end of the ninety days
I tendered Kelly $26 25, and asked for the
return of the note and mortgage. He
coolly told me I had committed forgery
by signing the name of Mr. Colvard and
that it would cost me $500 to get out of
it. I told him that he knew that I had
no money, and he suggested that my
father had had four years in the Sheriff's
office and was pretty well fixed and would
be willing to put up to avoid my being
disgraced. 1 told him he was foolish and
that he had better return the note.
"The next I heard of the matter was his
going to Prosecuting Attorney Abe Leach
and asking for a warrant for forgery.
Mrs. Kelly also attempted in Judge
Quinn's court to get a warrant and was
refused. After that Kelly took the matter
before the Grand Jury. Mrs. Colvard was
subpenaed and told the story as 1 am
telling it. Her husband was also before
the jury, acknowledged his signature to
the note and said he had given me a
power of attorney to act for him. My at
torney, Hugh Aldrich, went before the
Grand Jury. showed the power of attor
ney, and so far as I know the grand jurors
promptly decided to end the matter right
there.
"A few days ago Kelly met me and I
asked Constable Weidler to keep within
hearing distance while I conversed with
him. Once more Kelly offered to drop
the whole business for $500. I asked him
if he knew that, supposing I were guilty
of forgery, he was compounding a felony
by making such a proposition, and he re
plied that he didn't care if he were."
Constable Ed Weidler corroborated At
torney White's statement this afternoons
"Attorney White and Kelly were talking
on the street." said Weidler. "and I heard
White remark that Kelly was making a
fool of himself running around trying to
procure warrants and telling everybody
of the incident. 'Well, It will cost $500,' I
heard Kelly Bay. 'You know that is Im
possible.' said White, 'for I haven't any
money and I certainly wouldn't put up a
cent If I had.' 'Well, your old man Is
well fixed and he can afford It, and I
would guess he would rather do it than
see you go to jail, for he thinks a lot of
his boys, Kelly answered. I then stepped
up and said to -Kelly. 'You must be run
ning a bluff,' to which he replied, 'No, I
am not; I am not in the bluffing business.'
That is the part I heard."
Attorney White stated to-night that he
shall certainly bring suit next week
through Attorney Aldrich against Kelly
for attempted extortion.
an hour when he was captured by the po
lice and taken to the City Prison.
He was arrested on the night of the last
elections in front of The Call offi< for
stealing a purse from the. pocket of P. J.
Thomas, a printer, containing $140, which
he passed during his flight from Detective
Egan to J. O'Kane, harnessmaker, Golden
Gate avenue, who happened to be stand
ing near him at the time. At his prelim
inary examination before Judge Conlan
the case was dismissed, but the police
took the matter before the Grand Jury
and an indictment was returned against
Young.
Young had meantime fled from the city
and went to I^os Angeles.
SMOTE THOSE WHO SAID
SHE USED FACE POWDER
MRS. J. J. TRAVER ASSAULTS
ATTORNEY PISTOLESI.
"You're no gentleman. Take that"â
Smack! "And that"â Biff!
Suiting the action to the foregoing
words, Mrs. J. J. Traver. the prepossess
ing wife of a Mission livery stable pro
prietor, landed her little palm Hush on the
jaw of Attorney Pistoles! . and not being
satisfied with the love tap, smote him on
the nose with her clinched list.
Mr. Pistoles! thought he was witness
ing a police parade, he saw so many stars
on receiving the last blow. His friend,
John 13. Fletcher, came to his assistance,
but the plucky little woman dealt the
peacemaker a smash on the face and de
parted triumphantly with her husband.
The trouble was all due to the fact that
the lady was accused of using powder on
her fair face. In her eye it was an enor
mous insult. She lirst sputtered and then
wreaked vengeance on her detainers. The
incident occurred outside the courtroom
of Justice Dunn at the City Hall, and
was witnessed by a number of people,
who admired the pluck of Mrs. Traver.
It was due to testimony given in a case
in which her husband was the defendant
in a suit brought by J. Vencilllone, a clerk
in Pistolesl's office, who tried to recover
$ v on an assigned claim of Fletcher, who
is a resident of Watsonville.
Fletcher testified that when he called
at Mr. Traver's livery stable at 2(127 Mis
sion street to obtain money due him, he
did not see Mrs. Traver. but when he
went the second time he did, but she was
not as powdered then as she was in court.
Mrs. Traver would not brook this slight
ing remark, and called for the court's
protection. "I don't powder," she Indig
nantly replied. To prove it the lady re
moved her veil and asked Judge Dunn
whether there was any "chalk" on her
countenance. . Judge Dunn, after assuring
Mrs. Traver that there was no trace of
whitening there, turned to Fletcher and
told him his remarks were uncalled for.
His Honor then apologized to the irate
woman for the insult offered her and the
case proceeded.
Attorney. Pistolesi for the plaintiff, dur
ing his cross-examination of Mrs. Traver,
stated to the court this "powdered-faced
lady was grossly mistaken." This remark
again aroused the anger of Mrs. Traver,
and she cried:
"I want you to apologize right here, or
you will have to out of court."
Judge Dunn gave a decision against
Traver ln the sum of $53 and all parties
left the room. As soon as they were in
the corridor Mrs. Traver demanded an
apology, and as it was slow in forthcom
ing she acted as above narrated.
Last evening Mrs. Traver denied thai
sin had ever been to court or that she
had slapped the attorney.
Captain Dillon Indicted.
r f_he Federal Grand Jury yesterday re-
THE SAIN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, APRIL 15, 1899.
turned a true bill of indictment against
Captain Dillon of the Morgan City for
beating a sailor named Gus Mohl' oh- the
high seas. The trial was fixed for next
Monday morning. Â» *
The charges against Johann Hallln and
Fred Dautn accused of stealing copper
from the navy-yard at Mare Island were
Ignored. The principals had been acquit
ted. and the evidence against Hallln and
Dautfi was not admissible on the ground
that they had made certain incriminating
statements because of promises of im
munity extended to them. â ..â¢'-*.; â '</;
S. P. AND STATA FE
WILL GO IT ALONE
RATE TO MISSOURI RIVER
POINTS ADVANCED.
The passenger agents of transcontinen
tal lines represented on this, coast have
not as yet been able to come to any
agreement upon the share of military
traffic eastward that shall be allotted to
each system. Although there have been
a number of conferences held during the
past two weeks looking to a settlement
of the Question, they have resulted ln
nothing but dissatisfaction. The general
opinion on, the part of the conferring
agents was that the Southern Pacific in
asking 72 and 72V_ per cent of all the traf
fic for its Portland, Ogden and El Paso
routes was demanding the lion's share
of the business and they declined to agree
to it.
The initial proposition made by the
Southern Pacific was that It should al
low the Santa Fe system 20 per cent of
the traffic and divide the otner 80 per cent
between its three lines â 65 per cent via
Ogden, 10 per cent via tut Paso and 5 per
cent via Portland. The Santa Fe de
manded 40 per cent, but finally compro
mised on 27'_. Then the Ogden connec
tions of the Southern Pacific stood out
for 66 2-3 per cent of the traffic instead of
65, and demanded that the Southern Pa
cific be allowed nothing at all for its
freight line via El Paso.
Matters hung fire at this point and
since then the Southern Pacific has given
up hope of coming to any agreement that
would be satisfactory to itself. Yester
day it took the matter in its own hands
and with the Santa Fe put up the rate
on second-class traffic to Missouri River
points from $35 to $3750, a raise of $250,
and Passenger Agent Donaldson an
nounced that the Southern Pacific would
go it alone if it had to and would allow
"the other fellows" a fair proportion of
the traffic. :;â¢ '.
All this rumpus over rates has been
kicked up over the question of which
road should get the few straggling In
valided or time expired soldiers who are
arriving from time to time from Manila,
and while it has been going on the north
ern lines, which are running $1 50 cheaper
to St. Paul under the present rates than
the Southern Pacific and Santa Fe, have
been gathering in the trade with only
their narrow margin as an inducement.
FURTHER DELAY GAINED
BY A TECHNICALITY
WAR STAMP CASES REMANDED
TO FEDERAL COURT.
Some time ago Judge Morrow of the
Circuit Court delivered a lengthy opin
ion in which he stated that his tribunal
had no jurisdiction to try the suits
brought by G. B. Benham and B. John
son against Wells, Fargo & Co., arising
out of tin- refusal of the corporation to
forward packages unles a war stamp
was affixed to them by the senders.
Despite this fact E. S. Pillsbury. coun
sel for the wealthy but unpatriotic cor
poration, has again invoked the aid of the
Federal court to stave off paying the
judgments that are likely to be awarded
tin- plaintiffs by Justice Barry, before
whom the cases are pending. On Mon
day last Mr. Pillsbury secured writs of
certiorari from the Circuit Court and
served them on Judge Barry. This unex
pected move for delay resulted in both
cases being dropped from the Justices'
court calendar when they were called,
two days later.
Now that the cases have been remanded
to the Circuit Court they are likely to re
j main there for many months. The evi
dent plan of the corporation is to have
Judge Morrow again decide he has no Ju
risdiction, so that an appeal can be
taken to the United States Court of Ap
peals. The latter tribunal will sit next
month, but as the appeal will not be per
fected In that short time It will have to
be heard during the October term. The
technicality resorted to by the counsel for
the corporation is to attain but one ob
ject, and that is to permit his client to
! continue its policy of collecting eight and
! ten thousand dollars a month from the
people for war taxes which it Is in duty
| bound to pay.
VERMONTERS ENTERTAIN.
A .Charming Operetta Given at Odd
Fellows' Hall.
The monthly social and dance of the
Pacilic Coast Association of the Sons of
Vermont at Odd Fellows' Hall last night
drew a large crowd.
One of the smoothest and cleverest en
tertainments ever provided by the asso
ciation was given from the stage and
thoroughly enjoyed by the thousand and
more in the audience.
The charming operetta, "The Odd
Trick," which took up more than half of
the evening, was introduced after an
overture by Delleplane's orchestra and a
couple of recitations by Mrs. Turner Bar
ton. It is a pretty little musical farce,
with interesting complications, and as Its
title would indicate dealing with intri
cate problems in whist and love. It all
came right in the end, however, thanks
to the indefatigable efforts of Rhys
Thomas, late of the Tivoli, under whose
direction It was produced, .and the other
members of the cast, consisting of Miss
Clara Atkins, Miss Donnelly, Mrs. Clark,
C. Fielding and W. Kneass.
The dance and social which followed the
entertainment was a brilliant affair.
FIGHT WITH TWO THIEVES.
Charles McFadden and Frank Wilson
Arrested for Stealing Two
Hogsheads.
Two of the gang of thieves that drive
around in wagons and steal articles from
express and delivery wagons were cap
tured yesterday after a hot chase and de
termined light by Policemen Beamer and
Gibbons. Their names are Charles Mc-
Fadden and rank Wilson.
The officers were notified by a woman
that two men had driven up In a wagon
to the warehouse of Stevens, Arnhold &
Co., Stanford and Townsend streets, and
had stolen two empty wine hogsheads
worth $10 each. Ten minutes later they
saw he men on Harrison street with one
of the hogsheads In the wagon and started
off in pursuit.
The chase continued for several blocks,
but the officers finally overtook them, and
both showed light. Wilson fought des
perately and had to be clubbed Into sub
mission. They were charged with petty
larceny at the City Prison.
Agent for the Fair.
A special meeting of the board of trus
tees of the Mechanics' Institute was held
yesterday, in order to appoint an agent
for the coming Mechanics' Fair. The com
mittee on employes recommended that the
secretary of the institute, Joseph M.
Camming, be appointed agent of the fair
and, in addition to his other duties, to
superintend the collection and installation
of the exhibits. It was so ordered.
Mr. i 'uramlni* will commence active
work immediately. It was decided that
one of the interesting features of the fair
will be an Illustration of the process of
liquefying air, which has been recently
perfected by Professor Charles E. Tripley
of New York.
To-night Professor Armin O. Leuschner,
Ph.D., will deliver a lecture at the Me
chanics' Institute on "What We Know of
the Stars." . Professor Leuschner is di

pecially those showing Camp Dewey and

ETTA BROOKE
WILL BECOME
A HAPPY BRIDE
Twice Saved From
Untimely Death.
TO WED FREDERICK KNICK
SHE NO LONGER FEARS MUR
DEROUS CHEESEMAN.
A Rift in the Clouds That Have
Darkened the Home of a Father
less and Destitute Oak
land GirL
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, April 14.
A rift has broken in the clouds that
shadowed the life of Etta Payne-Brooke,
whom Frank H. Cheeseman attempted to
murder last August, and she has found
a champion In Frederick August Knlck.
The first step in an affair that will
prove a surprise even to Miss Brooke's
mother was taken this afternoon, when
the young lady and Mr. Knick obtained
a marriage license at the County Clerk's
office. The prospective bride has just
reached her nineteenth year, and Knlck,
who is an industrious young man of well
to do parents, has just arrived at his ma
jority.
Less than a month ago Etta Brooke,
her mother and a younger sister were
found dying In their rooms at The Oak
land, on Seventh street, from starvation
and sickness. Their destitution was re
ported to the local authorities and Health
Officer Dunn took their case in hand. His
strongest efforts to save the life of the
youngest proved futile, and before the
day had run its course she passed away.
Through proper care and nourishment
Mrs. Brooke and Etta were spared from
joining the lamented child, and the
father, Henry J. Brooke, had fallen
at the hands of Cheeseman seven months
before.
It Is hinted that young Knlck exercised
his kindly generosity on behalf of Mrs.
Brooke and her surviving daughter. A
friendship sprang up, which ripened into
love, and now. In total Ignorance of Mrs.
Brooke, the two young people are soon
to be made man and wife.
"We tried ever so hard to keep our
little love affair a secret," said Miss
Brooke this evening. "You see, It is no
body's business but our own."
"Mr. Knlck has been very kind to us
and he is a very worthy young man.
Though mamma knows nothing of our in
tentions. I know we shall all be happy.
I met Mr. Knlck about three months ago
and we loved each other at first sight.
No, I have no further fears that Cheese
man will bother us. Oh, it was all so
terrible, and I can hardly realize now that
I shall be happy once more; but I'm go
ing to be just the. same, though the date
of our wedding day is not yet set."
One night last August Frank H. Cheese
man called at the -iOme.of the Brooke
family In this city. Henry J. Brooke, the
father, came to the door, and Cheeseman,
excited with liquor, shot him dead. He
then shot the girl Etta, whom he pro
fessed to love madly; and the mother
also received a wound. For two months
the girl's recovery was questionable.
Robbed thus of their main support the
family was compelled to look to charity,
which proved so meager that their con
dition all but brought them to the verge
of death. â OSBOB
Cheeseman, the wrecker of the Brooke
family, ls now in the insane asylum at
Napa. Twice his trial on the murder
charge was begun ln the Superior Court
and each time a jury determined that
the accused was Insane. Shortly after
his first commitment to an Insane asy
lum the authorities of the institution ad
vised the District Attorney that Cheese
man was merely feigning. Since his last
commitment he managed a few months
ago to escape, but was retaken, and again
the experts at the asylum contend that
Cheeseman Is not Insane.
Should he ever again return to this clty
and attempt to molest his erstwhile pro
fessed sweetheart he will find a stalwart
young husband to protect her whom he
once tried kill.
REDEMPTORIST FATHERS'
SUCCESSFUL MISSION
ST. ROSE'S CHURCH CROWDED
EVERY EVENING.
Excellent Work Being Accomplished
by Fathers Distler, Hild, Mc-
Geough and Cantwell.
At St. Rose's Church on Brannan street
the Redemptorlst Fathers have been hold
ing a highly successful mission for women
and children during the past week. Each
night the sacred edifice has been crowded
with" worshipers, necessitating at times
the bringing in of extra benches. The
four missionaries. Fathers Distler, Hild,
McGeough and Cantwell, have labored
hard and the success of their efforts was
evidenced by the extraordinary attend
ance both at 5:30 a. m. and 7:30 p. m. serv
ices. Their sermons have been dogmatic
and moral, but In each they have shown
that their aim is no mere theoretical ex
position of the doctrine, but rather an
earnest exhortation to practical observa
tion of Catholic duties.
The order of devotions has been: Mass
at 5:30, followed by sermon; mass at 9
o'clock, followed by a sermon. In the
evening services begin at 7;30 o'clock. A
short instruction, followed by the recita
tion of the rosary, then a sermon, after
which the benediction of the holy sacra
ment.
Father Distler opened the mission for
married and single women last Sunday
morning after the 11 o'clock mass. He de
livered a strong sermon on "What Every
Woman Must Do to Make the Mission."
In the evening Father McGeough
preached on "The Importance of Saving
One's Soul." "On Monday evening Father
Hild preached on "Mortal Sin," and * the
following night Father Cantwell dis
coursed on "Death." Wednesday evening
Father Distler preached on "judgment
and Hell."
Father McGeough took the "Christian
Family" for his subject last night and
delivered an able sermon. Father Cant
well will dwell on "The Infinite Mercy of
God" to-night, when one of the most
beautiful ceremonies of the mission wiU
take place. Father Distler will preach on
the "Blessed Virgin, Her Power and Her
Patronage." At the conclusion of the
sermon the little girls will be dedicated,
followed by the entire congregation.
The mission will close on Sunday after
noon at 3 o'clock with the conferring of the
papal benediction by Father Distler. On
Sunday night the mission for the men of
the parish will' open. The order of exer
cises will be similar to the preceding
week. The music to-morrow evening will
be a grand feature of the services. Miss
Maggie Nugent will preside at the organ
and will render appropriate music.

GAGE IS READY TO
AWARD BURNS' PRIZES
The Mexican Will Dictate the Dis
tribution of Patronage-
Members of the Code Commission â Losing Gunst in
the Shuffle â Offering Bribes to Secure an Extra
Session of the Legislature.
â¢ Governor Henry T. Gape is coming
to this city to do practical politics. That
Is to say, the chief executive is coming
to allot the leaves' and fishes of political
triumph as Dan Burns and William F. j
Herrin shall Instruct him. Gage will '
simply be an official distributing agent,
acting under the authority of his super- ,
iors. As they dictate Gage will obey.
In th.-- selection of certain officers the
.Southern Pacific Company has at stake
more than one Important Interest which
William F. Herrin will not see neg
lected. The Governor will therefore
lend a listening ear and an obedient
pen. Then the wheels of the Burns
machine must be kept moving, and
Governor Gage will provide the cdl of
patronage. It cost something in money
and more in promises for the Mexican
to maintain his body guards, hired loaf
ers, touts and "boosters" at Sacra
mento. Not one of these rag-tag of
politics but wants a position, and at
the dictation of Burns the Governor of
California will supply the want.
This is practical politics as the spoils
man understands the game, and Gage
Is eminently practical. He has recov
ered from the mental strain of execu
tive duties and is expected to arrive ln
this city perhaps to-day. The Mexi
can's army of parasites is pruning It
self for the attack and It is said that
Burns has already distributed the pa
tronage. All that remains now for him
to do is to place a pen ln the willing
fingers of the Governor.
It is understood that the Governor's
visit to this city will mean the appoint
ment of a State Code Commission and
a new Board of Health for San Fran
cisco. More important than both, par
haps, will be the discussion of an extra
session of the Legislature. Burns takes
his defeat for the United States Sen
atorship bitterly and would make the
name of Gage more than it is a word
of reproach in California if the Gov
ernor would call an extra session and
permit the Mexican again to weight the
Republican party with scandal and dis
honor.
It ls understood that the Governor
will appoint ex-Supreme Justice W. C.
Van Fleet, H. V. Morehouse and G. W.
Denis as members of the new Code
Commission to succeed Bulla, Cami
netti and Shanahan. Two of these
men are well known to the people of
the State. The third is George W.
Denis, an associate and close personal
friend of Gage. Mr. Denis first came
prominently into public notice when he
was employed to argue to the Governor
certain reasons why certain measures
should receive the gubernatorial sig
nature. On these occasions Mr. Denis
was possessed of very marked elo
quence.
It is politically significant that Sen
ator Bulla will not be re-appointed a
member of the Code Commission. To j
those that know the relations existing j
between Governor Gage and Dan Burns
the affair Is not surprising. Governor
Gage is simply punishing Bulla for an
offense given to the Mexican. One of
the promises made by Burns during his
Senatorial fiasco was that he would
reward his friends and punish his ene
mies. State patronage was offered to j
those that supported him and political j
vengeance was threatened to those that |
opposed his preposterous ambition. I
Senator Bulla will feel the weight of
the Mexican's revenge.
During the early stages of the United
States Senatorial fight at Sacramento
Burns called upon Bulla and asked him
for his vote. Bulla replied emphatically
that under no circumstances would he
ever vote for Burns. The independence
of the State Senator surprised and an
gered Burns. "Young man," he said
to Bulla, "I have never had any one
talk to me in this way before, and I
shall see that you do not succeed In
polities hereafter." With that threat
Burns left, but the incident had not by
any means closed.
The facts of the Interview rapidly
spread in political circles and politi
cians remarked that Bulla was some
what indiscreet. A few days later Bulla
warned that if he persisted in remain
ing In the contest for United States
Senator his persistence would cost him
his place on the Code Commission.
Burns has kept his threat. He has
handled Governor Gage as a bludgeon
of revenge.
The Mexican Is attempting even more
shamefully to make the Governor of
California a catspaw. Ever since the
adjournment of the Legislature Burns
with the assistance of the Southern Pa
cific Company has been striving in
every possible way to create a false
public opinion in favor of an extra ses
sion of the Legislature. Burns knows
that Gage will do his bidding far more
readily than most self-respecting offi
cials would dare to do, but even Gage
balks in fear of the storm of outraged
public indignation that would follow
the call of an extra session simply to
assist a gambling politician into the
United States Senate. So Burns and
his supporters, allies and touts have
been working to create a false public
opinion In favor of an extra session. â¢
Southern Pacific newspapers and
cheap sheets bought into the service of
Burns are advocating such a course.
The railroad wants to elect Burns at
all hazards and is working quietly to
Induce Gage to call the session. State
legislators have been approached by
bribes not only by Mexican touts but
by agents of the railroad. One legis
lator from the Interior of the State was
asked if he would go into a caucus If
Governor Gage would call an extra ses
sion.
"I will do nothing of the kind," was
the legislator's reply. "The calling of
an extra session Is not within my prov
ince. That is a privilege reserved ny
the constitution to the Governor. If
he caMs such a session I will do my
duty and stay out of a caucus If a cau
cus means the shameful result of the
election of D. M. Burns." V.v :
Another State legislator -was ap
proached upon the same subject, but |
from a different point of view. He was
asked by a notorious railroad lobbyist
if he had an annual pass on the South
ern Pacific railroad. An answer was
given in the negative and the lobbyist
volunteered to give the legislator a
pass. The offer was declined with
thanks. The incident is significant, as
the offer was made during a discussion
of the prospect of an extra session. On
every Bide Burns is working and no
comment is being made of the fact that
he is laboring in political dishonesty to
achieve his end. He wants an extra
session, and then by any cheating,
trickery or political bribery to secure
the signatures of sixty-one Republican
members of the Legislature for a cau
cus.
The matter is of such serious moment,
owing to the domination of Burns over
Gage, that nearly all of the members
of the Legislature that are lawyers are
discussing the legal aspects of the af
fair. There is a unanimous opinion that
Governor Gage, under the constitution,
lias no legal right to call an extra ses
sion of the Legislature for the avowed
purpose of electing a United States
Senators The constitution provides
that such a call may be made only to
discuss the gravest necessities of the
State or matters that demand imme
diate attention owlner to the vital In
terests of the whole people. The elec
tion of a United States Senator means
neither.
This does not mean, however, that a
United States Senator cannot be elected
at an extra session which has been
called for another purpose. In 1886
Governor Stoneman called an extra
session of the Legislature to consider
irrigation affairs, which threatened at
that time to bring to farmers loss of
millions of dollars and perhaps life
itself. At that extra session a United
States Senator was elected. United
States Senator John F. Miller had died I
on March S. 1886. Governor Stoneman !
appointed George Hearst to fill the va
cancy. The extra session of the Legis
lature convened on July 20, 1886, ana on
August 3. 18S_, A. P. Williams was ;
elected to succeed Hearst. It is not
likely that this will in any way act as
a precedent as there Is no great or
grave Issue in the State demanding an
extra session. That some of the Burns
advisors understand that an extra ses
sion cannot be called to elect a United
States Senator ls clear from the fact
that the Mexican's forces attempted to
force an adjournment of the Legisla
ture before the appropriation bill was
adopted and thus give the Governor ;
an. excuse for calling an extra session. j
When the Governor arrives in this
city it is expected that he will appoint
a Board of Health for San Francisco.
Notwithstanding the fact that a new
board will hold offlce only until the
first of the year, when the charter will
become operative, Burns demands the
patronage for the machine. He has In- !
sisted that a "programme" board be
selected and that he name the em
ployes. Under this agreement the mem
bers of the new board will have abso
lutely nothing to do with the distribu
tion of patronage. They have not even
yet been named, but their patronage is
already being awarded. They are to be I
simply the figureheads of the machine.
Whoever they may be they will be or
dered to appoint Assemblyman Devoto
Milk Inspector, Mike Dunn Market In
spector and Jack Tyrrell Superintend
ent of the Almshouse.
It is expected also that Governor
Gage will receive his instructions from
Burns to appoint Jake Steppacher Reg
istrar of Voters for San Francisco.
Jake slipped somewhere on the rocks
of a civil service examination and is no
longer Chief Deputy Collector of Inter
na) Revenue. And then there is Mose
Gunst, the gambling Police Commis
sioner, whose term of office expired in
January and who has neither been re
appointed nor superseded. Governor
Gage will not disturb Mose. The chief
executive has received orders from
Burns to leave Mose alone, and the
chief executive will obey. But even
Gage dare not fly so savagely in the
faces of decent people as to reappoint
the gambler of the Police Commission.
When Governor Gage arrives in the
city he Will be placed in custody of D.
M. Burns.
HE HAS MICROBES.
Gage Says He Suffers From
Sacramento Microbesâ His
State Appointments.
LOS ANGELES, April 14.âSacra
mento air and â â  water have not worked
wonders for Governor Henry T. Gage.
He has malaria in his system, as a
gift for his three months' devotion to
duty. The Governor's physicians here
have informed him that there is no
telling how soon or when the germs of
the disease will leave his system. This
is the reason why Governor Gage did
not take the Owl train for the north
to-night as had been contemplated and
for which many preparations had been
made. In an interview to-night with
the Governor by telephone at his Dow
ney ranch he said:
"I am not feeling well and am not
prepared to say when I will go to Sac
ramento. I shall do so as soon as pos
sible, for I am anxious to dispose of a
mass of accumulated official business.
â¢ I have tried to free myself from the
cares of state and to prepare myself for
the future labor my office imposes. I
have received thousands of applications
for the offices at my disposal. There
are many disappointments in store.
Those who have been chosen will be
made known within a short time after
I arrive at the capital.- A number of
offices will not be filled at all at present.
The reason for this I decline to state."
The Governor added that he would re
turn to Los Angeles and participate in
the harbor jubilee celebration, which
opens April 26, and further, that he
would be in Los Angeles to-morrow to
transact private business.
Mrs. Gage and Lucille will not go
north with the Governor, but will re
main on the Downey ranch until such
time as a suitable house for a Gov
ernor's residence can be secured in Sac
ramento. Party leaders here say that
Gage has given orders to have his mail
forwarded to Sacramento and that he
will go direct to San Francisco to con
fer with those clothed with political
power upon questions of patronage and
similar topics.
It is stated, and the news comes from
the inner recesses of the push, that the
Governor while in San Francisco will
find out from Colonel Dan Burns how
far he has progressed in hiâ efforts to
tie- up the Republican majority in the
Legislature for a caucus upon the
United States Senatorshlp. "Whenever
Colonel Burns can make a prooer show
ing on this subject, it is asserted that
the Governor is prepared to call an ex
tra session of the Legislature. The im
portant appointments will be made by
Governor Gage next week. Three
THE SAN FRA-STCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, APRIL 15, 1899.
FOUND DEATH BENEATH
THE TREACHEROUS WAVES
George A* Wigney, a Young Alamedan, Perishes Within Sight of
Friends in the Ocean Off Olympic Pier*
Many Persons Have Been Swept to Death Frbm This
Pier, Which Is Supposed to Be Closed.
fTIHE treacherous waves that beat
unceasingly against the iron beat
islngly against the iron pil-
I lars of Olympic pier, on the ocean
beach below the Cliff House,
claimed another victim yesterday.
George A. Wigney, a resident of Ala
meda, while lounging about the end of
the long pier, lost his balance and
pitched forward into the sea. When he
came to the surface his arms were
crossed upon his breast and his eyes,
while open, were glazed as in death.
His companions threw him a rope, but
he paid no heed to their cries and ges
ticulations.
The body floated ln an upright posi
tion, riding the waves buoyantly. The
tide carried It gradually to the north
ward. When near Seal Rocks it dis
appeared from tho view of thousands
of spectators who had seen the tragedy
enacted before them. William Mc-
Donald, who was one of the little
group at the end of the pier, ran to
the lifeboat station when he saw the
man was beyond the reach of any or
dinary assistance. Captain Varney
and his men launched the lifeboat as
rapidly as possible . and rowed to the
scene of the accident. Willing hands
pointed out the course taken by the
body, but no trace of it could be
found and the search was abandoned.
Decedent left his home in Alameda
early in the morning and met his sis
ter, Mrs. Charles Ratta, at the home
of Mrs. H. L. MeKnew. 812 lowa street.
They went direct to the beach. After
strolling about for a time young Wig
Paris Exposition commissionerships
will be among the first named. - ,
It is stated that W. H. Mills wii' li
the chairman of the board and that
Mark McDonald of Santa Rosa and
Ben C Truman of Los Angeles - will
represent the two other divisions of the
State This news has sent friends of
Frank Wiggins, secretary of the Los
\ngeles Chamber of Commerce, Into the
depths of a brown study. At least two
weeks will elapse before the adjutant
general is announced. Should Colonel
George Stone decline, owing to his
contract on the surf line of the South
ern Pacific, the place will go to Colonel
Currier or Colonel Smedberg of San
Francisco. Major Baugham of Pasa
dena is looked upon as the coming as
sistant in the adjutant general's of
fice It is stated that Mrs. Adina
Mitchell will not be retained in .--the
Whittier Reform School directory. The
new president of the Whittier board
will undoubtedly be Dr. Walter Llnd
ley whose reputation as the manager
of such institutions is world-wide. Dr.
Llndley first established the school and
later made it a model of its kind. Gov
ernor Gage is known to think very
highly of . his abilities. ,;;':-^;

DIED VERY SUDDENLY.
William F. Burke, the Popular Young
Politician, Passes Away After
a Short Illness.
William F. Burke, an ex-Deputy Su
perintendent of . Streets, died yesterday
at the home of his, parents at 338 Oak
street after a ten minutes' illness. Death
was due to heart failure.. The deceased
was seemingly in the best of health when
he retired for the night, but about 1:30
a. m. his brother, who occupied the same
bed with him, was awakened by his heavy
breathing. He immediately awakened the
household and a messenger was dispatch
ed for Dr. Reagan, but before the physi
cian arrived the stricken man, breathed
his last. The blow was a severe shock to
his family and friends.
The deceased was 31 years of age and
was employed as shipping clerk by E.
Martin & Co. He was a brother of
â¢Thomas Burke, ex-Assemblyman in the
Thirty-seventh District, and was a
prominent factor in Democratic politics
in Hayes Valley.
The funeral will take place to-nvrirrow
from bis late residence, and after services
at SaCred Heart Church the remains will
be Interred in -fount Calvary Cemetery.

ney left the ladies and made his way
out to the end of the pier. He had
been gone some time when his sister
noticed the lifeboat. She drew her
companion's attention to it and they
watched it with listless interest. Mrs.
MeKnew said the men were probably
practicing, which they did regularly,
and remarked casually that It seemed
hard work.
They had some luncheon for their
escort and were looking about for
some one whom they could send for
him. At this moment the sister saw
a boy carrying her brother's hat. The
cruel truth flashed upon her mind in
an instant and she shrieked in anguish.
She was led away from the scene by
gentle hands and everything possible
was done to assuage her grief.
From the manner in which young
Wignoy fell some spectators formed
the opinion that his death was Inten
tional, not accidental. Persons on the
spot disprove this, and the relatives of
the dead man scout the idea. He
father died at Cnristmastime, and a
sister also died about a year since. He

TO MURDER HER
BROTHER-IN-LAW
Ida Nolan Shoots at

LOCKS HERSELF IN A ROOM AND
DEFIES THE POLICE.
â ,
The Infuriated Woman Declares That
Her Intended Victim Was
Conspiring Against
Her. ]J.
â  Ida Nolan, an attractive young woman
of 25 years, last night mad. a desperate
attempt to kill Alfred Rosenthal, her
brother-in-law. Thinking that he was try
ing to turn her mother against her the
impulsive young woman fired two shots
at him, neither of which took effect.
The shooting occurred at 1623 Bush
street, where the m.ther'of the young
woman lives. Rosenthal was married to
Miss Nolan's sister, who is now deceased.
Two comely children were the result of
the union. Since the death of the wife
Rosenthal has been living with his moth
er-in-law at the Bush street residence.
Recently Miss Nolan, thinking that Ro
senthal was trying to usurp her place ln
the affections of her mother, frequently
declared her Intention of killing him.
Shortly after 6 o'clock last evening Ro
senthal was sitting in the dining room of
his mother-in-law's residence playing with
his two children, when his fair assailant,
who was armed with a 38-caliber Smith &
Wesson revolver, crept from her room,
bent on "filling him with . lead," as she
expressed it. Stealthily approaching the
room in which were seated Rosenthal and
his two innocent clldren the infuriated
woman raised her revolver and fired. Ro
senthal jumped out of his chair and closed
the door, before his murderous assailant
had a chance to fire another shot. Evi
dently determined to kill him the woman,
after falling to open (he -door, shot '
a short time a wave struck the pier,
and breaking over it wet us all. Mr.
Wigney took off his coat and spread it
out to dry. A general conversation
then sprung up among us. He had a
book in his hand and handed it to me,
saying he had read it. I was sitting
on the extreme end of the pier at this
time, and he was standing above me
with his right foot elevated upon the
pipe. He asked, 'Do you like to
read?" As I looked up to reply I saw
him lose his balance and fall into the
sea.
"He seemed dazed when he camo to
the surface, and although we threw
him a rope he made no effort to grasp
it. When I saw we could not save him
I ran to the life-saving station and the
boat was launched. The men picked
up the hat of the drowned man, but
saw no trace of him. He was a
stranger to me. He was well dressed
and hardly looked over 18 years of
age."
Decedent was 20 years old. He was
at one time employed as a clerk by
Mack & Co., wholesale druggists.
After that he served In a clerical ca
pacity In a 'lumber yard. He has been
out of work some weeks. . He was a
member of Alameda Boat Club, hav
ing joined recently. His mother and
three sisters survive him.
The day was an ideal one for pleas
ure-seeking, and the beach was
thronged. Children frolicked about in
the foam-girt sea, little thinking how
pi tilt the great body of water was to
persons who were at its mercy. An
hour after the accident the crowds had
changed so thoroughly that few knew
of the tragedy which had made a
house of mourning across the bay.

through the panel, the bullet passing in
dangerous proximity to the head of one
of the children of her intended victim.
The shooting aroused Mrs. Nolan, who
was reclining on a lounge in her room on
the upper floor, and throwing open a win
dow she lustily screamed for help. Po
lice Officer Alexander of the North End
station was passing at the time and he
quickly entered the house. He was met
by Rosenthal, who begged him to arrest
his murderous sister-in-law. â .
"She will kill me it" you don't arrest
her," he excitedly declared. "For God's
sake take her away!"
Rosenthal, who is a civil engineer, in
formed the officer that his sister-in-law
had locked herself in her room and

At the house where the shooting oc
curred the strictest silence was main
tained by the inmates. Rosenthal, acting
under instruction's from his mother-in
law, refused to give his version of the
â¢-hooting. Mrs. Nolan, after declaring
that her daughter was drunk and not re
sponsible for her actions, ordered the re
porters to leave her house under penalty
of being thrown into the street.
For Lack of Prosecution.
The charge of threats to kill, preferred
by Theresa Fredericks against her father,
Jacob Fredericks, the expressman, was
dismissed by Judge Conlan yesterday,' as
the daughter did not appear to prosecute.
Fredericks took the stand and ' declared
that he had no intention of shooting his
daughter because she was to marry
against his will, but said it only to scare
her. The daughter is now under the pro
tection of her husband.
