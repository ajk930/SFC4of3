WASHINGTON,. April
9.â Justice Stephen. J.
Field of the; United
States Supreme- Court, retired;
died at his home on Capitol Hill
in this city at 6:30 .o'clock this
evening of kidney complication.
About his bedside were his wife
and her sister, Mrs. J. G. Smith;
Justice David J. Brewer of the
Supreme Court, his nephew;
Mrs. Fdgerton of California,
Mr. Lawton, his private secre
tary; Rev. Edward M. Mott,
rector of the Church of the Ad-
vent, â¢ and the family servants.

came painlessly.
Ever 'since Justice Field's, re
; tirement from the Supreme
' Court bench in December, 1897,
â  he has enjoyed comparatively
-<Pfc>od health, and being relieved
trom the responsibilities which
he had borne for so many years,
v. he became more cheerful than
;' - formerly and seemed to enjoy the
society of his. friends and ac
! intances more than ever be
; fore. All during the winter when
â¢ ..the weather was fair it was his
â¢â¢â¢ custom to take daily drives about
: _ the city or through the grounds
of the Soldiers' Home, and al
ways returned refreshed. i
... About two weeks ago, how
ever, he took a longer ride than
usual in an open carriage and
contracted a severe cold, which
'. rapidly developed the kidney
.-; ' troubles from which he had suf
â¢â¢ fered, though but slightly, for
â¢ some time.
The disease readily yielded to

he lost consciousness. From
that time he sank rapidly and ex-
pired at 6 130. o'clock. _
.No arrangements have yet
been made for the funeral, 'nor is
it now known where he will be
buried. It is probable that his
remains will be taken to Stock
bridge, Mass.,' where are buried
his father and mother and . his
brothers Cyrus, Dudley and Jon
athan, two - sisters and other
members of the Field family. It
is .possible, however, that Mrs.
Field 'may decide to take his.re
mains to California, where a con
siderable par? of .his active life
was" passed before.P resident Lin
coln appointed him a member of
the Supreme bench.
Justice and Mrs. Field never
had any: children, and the only
surviving, member of his father's
family is the Justice's youngest
brother, Dr. Henry Field, the
editor of The Evangelist. Dur
ing several years prior to his re
tirement from the bench the Jus
tice's health at times seemed, on
the point of .breaking, but he
usually recovered promptly and
in a few days would again resume
his judicial duties. For the past
year and more the most intimate
with him knew his mental powers
were becoming somewhat Im
paired. The results of his long
career of great mental activity
were beginning to show them
selves in a failing- memory after
his retirement from the bench,
though his physical ; health
seemed to improve a little.
STEPHEN JOHNSON FIELD.
Justice Stephen Johnson Field- was a
member of a remarkable family. He was
born in Haddam, Conn., November 4.
1816. His father. Rev. David Dudley
Field, was distinguished as ; a preacher,
scholar and historical '.writer; and , his
grandfather. Captain Timothy Field, ob
tained hla military title by gallant ser- '

vice in the American Revolution. If any
father ever had cause to be proud of his
sons It was Rev. David Dudley Field.
Four of his. sons became famous and
three of them have left an impress
their times and attained world-wide celeb
rity. The eldest, David Dudley Field,
was a lawyer of great eminence, of whom
an "English chancellor said that "he had
done more for the reform of laws than
any other man living." His works on
international law have been translated
Into the various European languages and
Into Chinese. Cyrus West Field, the
third son, conceived and carried out the
project of the Atlantic cable, and. John
Bright pronounced him "the Columbus
of modern times, who, by his cable, had
moored the New World alongside the
Old." Henry Martyn Field, the fourth
â son, was eminent as a clergyman and
historian. . Stephen J. Field was the sec
ond son and his name will live as that
of one of the leading jurists of the cen
tury. â¢ Â
When Justice Field was only 13 he went
to Smyrna to visit his sister, the mother
of" Justice Brewer. He visited Athens and
studied there the modern Greek and
learned to speak It fluently. He had a
lot of experiences during cholera times In
Asia Minor and came back to New York.
He was graduated at Williams College
in 1837, standing first in his class;' and he
then went to New York, studied law ln
the office of his brother, David Dudley,
and after his admission to the bar be-'
came a member of the firm.
Next he went to Paris, and .while there
read the news that gold had been discov
ered In California. He struck a bee line
for America and took a ship for the
Golden Gate. He landed in San Francisco
with $10 in Ids pockets and had to pay
out seven of these to have his trunks
taken up. from the wharf. He slept on
the floor that night in a room for j which
he was to pay $33 a week rent, and his
breakfast the next morning, the cheapest
he could find, cost him $2. The result was
that his .first day in California was begun
with $1 in his pocket. He was then 33
years old and be says that, notwithstand
ing his lack of funds, he felt happy and
hopeful. He had, however,, only $1 left,
and he needed money at once. His^itrst
earnings came from a lot of old newspa
pers which he had brought along to read
on the voyage. He had sixty-four of these
and gave them to a man to sell, with
the understanding that he was to
divide the profits. New York pa
pers were then worth $1 apiece in
San Francisco, and the man ped
dled them out, getting $64 for the lot.
He gave the future Supreme Court Jus
tice half and when young Field, found
that jurymen' got $8 a day and that the
average workman was often paid as much
as $16 a day, the prospects seemed
brighter. His next; step was to collect a
note of $400 which belonged to David Dud
ley Field. He saw the sign of the maker
of the note and learned that the man had
grown rich in California. He called upon
him and began to talk about the country,
without saying anything about . the note.'
"Ah," said the man, "you will like it out
here; this is a glorious country. I have
already made $200,000."
: "Is that bo?" said Mr. Field. "I am

DYED HIS KNIFE
IN WOMAN'S BLOOD,
THEN IN HIS OWN
Awful Dual Crime of E. A. yon Schmidt.
Stabbed His Former Wife to Death,
Tr;eo Killed I-|iH)self.
Alameda Office San Francisco Call.
1428 Park Street. April 9.
THE unhappy matrimonial rela
tions of Captain E. A. yon
Schmidt and his wife, Isabelle.
terminated to-day in a horrible
double ' tragedy. The \ captain
stabbed his wife to death;, with a
dirk-knife, and then made five vicious
jabs at himself until the blade . pene
trated his heart and he fell dead be
side the woman he had murdered.
There were no eye witnesses to the
affair. ' It happened at the bottom of
the back' stairs leading from the resi
dence, 2232 San Jose avenue, which had
been the homer of Mrs. yon Schmidt
and her five children since she was
divorced from her husband a few
months ago. '
For some weeks Yon Schmidt has
been pleading with friends\^n this city
to affect a reconciliation between him
self and his wife, and the latter 's flat
refusal to forget and forgive the
wrongs of the past is looked upon as
the immediate cause of the tragedy.
Mary Thompson, a domestic in the
employ of Mrs. yon Schmidt, gives the
most connected story of the affair.
She was making the bed in the room
occupied by Rose, the eldest child, in
the 'front part of the house, when she
looked out the window and saw Cap
tain yon Schmidt coming along San
Jose avenue from the direction of Wal
nut street. Not desiring to alarm Mrs.
yon Schmidt, whom she knew feared
her husband would do her bodily in
jury, Miss Thompson called the child
Rose and told her that her father was
coming. The little girl in turn in
formed her mother, who went to the
parlor window.. ind seeing Captain yon
Schmidt coming up the front steps,
went to the door to admit him.
What happened immediately after is
not clear. ' Miss ' Thompson and the
children had retired to the rear rooms
when they were startled by piercing
shrieks from M-Â«<. yon Schmidt, who
come running toward the kitchen, yell
ing, "Murder! Murder! Help me. For
God's sake, help me!" She was. close
ly followed by Yon Schmidt with a dirk
knife in one hand and a pistol in the
other. Miss Thompson ran out of the
house onto the back porch, and as she
passed through the kitchen door Yon
Schmidt hurled his revolver at her
head. His aim was poor arid the
weapon landed far out in the back
yard. The servant hurried down the
steps and out to the street, where she
gave the alarm.
When neighbors arrived on the scene
both the participants in the tragedy !
were dead. Yon Schmidt had stabbed
his wife five times in the back as she
fled down the stairway, literally slash
ing her to pieces. One of her ribs was
cut in twain and her right shoulder was
all but severed from the body.
The woman struggled desperately at
the landing below in an endeavor to es
cape the murderous grasp of her ex- I
husband, but she was but a frail crea
ture compared with the gigantic stature
of Yon Schmidt and weak from her
fearful wounds, and it was but the
work of a moment for him to over
power her, and as she lay prostrate on
her back he tore her clothing from her
breast' and plunged his dirk knife
through her heart.
Then, standing at the feet of the
murdered woman, he. turned the blade
on himself, and after inflicting five gap
ing wounds over the region of the heart
finally penetrated that vital organ and
with outstretched arms fell back dead.
Colonel A. W. yon Schmidt, father of
the dead man, arrived on the scene a
few minutes after the tragedy. It had
been his habit since his son and daugh
ter-in-law were â¢ divorced to visit the
children every Sunday. He sympa
thized with the mother in the matri
monial troubles, and for this reason he
and his son had not been on the most
friendly terms. The children were his
pets, and on his regular visits he never
failed to come with an armful of toys
and sweetmeats for the little ones.
When he heard of what had happened- j
he was prostrated for a few seconds,
but his thoughts reverted from the
tragedy to the five little children so
suddenly left parentless, and, remark- [
Ing to those who surrounded him that
they must be cared for, he pulled him
self together and went in quest of the
little ones. In the meantime they had
been taken to the home of Dennis
Welch, the next-door neighbor, where
the grandfather joined them.
C. A. McCurrie, a piano tuner, who lives
at 2225 Clinton avenue, was first on the
scene.
' "I heard some screeching," said Mr. Mc-
Currie, "and being acquainted with the
Yon Schmidts I knew what was up. I
rushed into the back yard just as Yon
Schmidt staggered and fell. His wife was
still alive, but unconscious. Four of her
little children were about her crying,
'Oh, mamma, oh, mamma, don't die
don't die!' It was the most pitiful scene
I ever witnessed.' Hurrying the little ones
Into the house I ran for assistance, but
when I returned both man and wife were
dead.' ,
Mrs. L. C Johnson of 2128 Clement ave
nue is probably the last person with whom
Yon Schmidt conversed before he started
ion his mission of murder. Mrs. Johnson
| has been a friend of the family for years,
I and taking advantage of this Yon Schmidt
has been importuning her for weeks to go
to his wife and make overtures for a
reconciliation. "Â£';'â¢.
"April 19 would have been the fifteenth
anniversary of their marriage," said Mrs.
Johnson, "and the captain was making
desperate efforts to persuade his -wife to
forgive him for the past and return to
him before then. He wanted a grand
family reunion on that day and proposed
to commence then to lead a new life. He
loved â¢ the woman to distraction, and I
think he has brooded over the divorce un
til his mind gave away. He Imagined at
times that she had not been true to him,
and then he would tell me in the next
breath that she was a good woman.
"He visited me shortly after noon to
day and again asked me to go to his
wife. I told him I would not. carry mes
sages, and. he asked me for writing ma
terial to send her a letter. I had visited
INSANE JEALOUSY'S VICTIM.
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
Mrs. yon Schmidt the day before and
talked the matter over with her in a
friendly way, but not with any idea of
inducing her to return to the captain.
She told me then that a reconciliation
â¢was impossible, and that she hated him
as much as he loved her. I repeated this
to the captain to-day. There was a wild
look about him when I told him. His
face turned ashy pale, and he said he
would see her himself. Fea/ing that he
would do something desperate, I begged
him not to harm her. His only reply
was; 'I love her! I love her! Rather than
let another man get her we will die to
gether.' He broke down and cried like
a baby, and, after regaining his compos
ure, bid me good by and left."
This was at 12:20 o'clock. Ten minutes
later Yon Schmidt had taken the life of
his wife and ended his own.
The letters written at Mrs. Johnson's
house were found on the captain's per
son. They are rambling affairs, and give
evidence that the man was not in his
right mind. Both are addressed to Rob
ert Eagleson of San Francisco and
dated at the Russ House, although iden
tified by . Mrs. Johnson as the letters
written to-day at her house. They read
as follows:

nel A. W. yon Schmidt for th. welfare of
lis grandchildren thus bereft of parental ,
protection. He hastened to the Welch
residence, where the little ones were be

each one did his utmost to soothe them,
remarking the while, ."Never mind, pets,
never mind- You will want for nothing
while Grandpa yon Schmidt lives, and I
Will see that you are cared for after 1 am |

Colonel yon Schmidt refused to view the
remains of his _on and daughter-in-law.
While the Coroner was removing the
bodies to the morgue wagon the colonel j
gathered the children about him and hur- |
ried away from the place. He carried the |
baby in his arms, and as the old gentle
man passed through the crowd he covered
its face with kisses hat mingled with his
tears. The little ones were taken to the

Mr. and Mrs. Tilden speak in the highest
terms of the murdered woman. They say
she was a devoted, mother and a good
wife . and never deserved the suspicions
of her husband.

Was born in California, and was a mem

Greene refused his request, stating at the 'â 
time: "Yon Schmidt, it is 100 to 1 that
if I should allow you to go to your wife's j
house you will commit some act of Im- '
propriety there," Yon Schmidt was per
mitted, however, to have tho custody of
his children twice a month between the
hours of 1:30 and 5 p. m., but he was to
meet them at the door of their home, and j
not pass over the threshold. To-day was
his first visit since the permission was ,
granted. Judge Greene's surmises were
verified. $&Â£_{<
The inquest will be held on Tuesday
evening at the Alameda Morgue.
- Robert Eagleson declares there has i
never been the least impropriety In his re
lations to Mrs. yon Schmidt. He knew
her. he says, but ho had but little to do
with her after he found out what kind of |
a man she had married.
"I knew Mrs. yon Schmidt when she |
was a Miss Hill," said he last night. "I
used to room with her mother down here i
on Geary street up to two years ago, but :
.1 saw very little of Mrs. yon Schmidt. Her
husband was a jealous, cranky sort of a
man, and I was not so friendly with her ;
as I would have been if he had not been j
so peculiar. .'."-: V.t :.-.' s
"I never had much to do with Yon j
Schmidt. I never -liked him and I never j
could see why his wife stayed with him.
He rnaele life a burden to her, and I do not
poo how she stood it as long as si. did
before she sued for a divorce. He threat
ened to kill her' then, and I don't see why
she did not take warning from his man
ner then. I am only sorry he- did not kill i
himself before ho thought of killing her.
There was nothing in the life of the little :
woman but what was good. She was on .
the stage for a little while, but her hus- i
band need not have feared that she would I
go back to it. . I did send her tickets for \
â¦ho thertor ahotlt three weeks ago, but I i

did not go to the theater with her nor did
I eat lunch with her. She and I were
friends, but. as I say, because of the tem
perament of her husband I had very little
to do with either him or her. I have done
nothing that should connect me with this
case."
Among the yachtsmen of San Fran
cisco bay no figure was more "familiar |
than that of E. A. yon Schmidt. The I
owner of the big boat Cyclone and the |
designer and owner of the yacht Whirl- i
wind, he was largely instrumental in
founding the California Yacht Club and
in encouraging yachting among the deni
zens ox Oakland. The early meetings of
the committeemen of the Oakland navy
wej>i held on the Cyclone. No regatta
on the bay was complete without the
Whirlwind, which seldom was seen
twice riggÂ»3_ in the same way. Yon
Schmidt's favorite dress or undress was
a pair of blue denim trousers, cut high
above the knee. To this on special oc
casions such as regatta days he added a
bright scarlet undershirt and a big knife.
He was the first' commodore of the Cali
fornia Yacht Club, and was afterward
appointed admiral. The Whirlwind was a
very peculiarly designed craft, built like
a V, with no curving lines at all in her
construction, but handled by Yon Schmidt
she could beat anything of her dimen
sions in the hay. The extreme simplicity
of construction permitted the builder to
add on something to the Whirlwind when
ever he felt so inclined, and there were
really three Whirlwinds, each larger
than its predecessor. It was a sight to
see Yon Schmidt on a breezy day with a
row of small boysâ his own childrenâ on ,'
board, lashed together BO that if they
fell overboard they could bo hauled in I
again without difficulty. Among his j
brother yachtsmen Yon Schmidt was
always genial and pleasant. Among |
those who sailed the waters of San Fran- i
cisco bay, whether for pleasure or busi
ness, no figure was more conspicuous or
picturesque than his and few will be more j
missed.
ROOSEVELT TALKS TO
CHICAGO CROWDS
New York's Governor Given a Warm
Welcome in the Western
Metropolis.
CHICAGO, April 9.â Governor Theodore
Roosevelt of New York, who is to be the
guest of honor of the Marquette Club at
its annual Appomattox day banquet to
morrow, arrived in Chicago this evening.
The train bearing the Governor was met
at the suburban station of Englewood by
a reception committee, which was, how
ever, lost in an immense and enthusiastic
crowd that had gathered. The Governor
was forced to come to the platform of his
car and say a few words. From the mo
ment Governor Roosevelt left his car at
the Lake Shore depot, where he was met
by an escort of eight Rough' Riders, to
the doors of his hotel, he was surrounded
and followed by crowds, which Cheered
him every time he moved and shook his
hand till the Governor was forced to de
sist from sheer exhaustion. This evening
Governor Roosevelt was given a dinner
at the Union League Club. Here again
he was given a warm welcome and in
return made a short speech.
A short time previous Governor Robse
velt had dropped the remark that he was
a cog in a political machine himself, but
the sort of a cog that breaks away when
the. machine does not go right. In his
speech he began by advising the seventy
men sitting around the tables to stay out
altogether rather than cast "conscience
votes." >_fc__
"Political life is just like the roof tree
of a house," he said. "There is happi- !
ness and peace in politics. I suppose I
get as much happiness out of it as any
man, but as for peace " and the Gov
ernor paused.
He spoke sarcastically of so-called re
formers, whose agitation in many cases,
he said, helped to elect rogues. Governor
Roosevelt called them the "goo-goos" and :
declared he had reached the point where
it hurt him to have such men identified '
with him.

Special Cable to The Call and the Hew York Herald. Copyrighted, 1899, by James Gordon Bennett.
... . : -, .
LONDON, April 9.â Two men were found In Messrs. Thornycroft's Ship- building Yard at- Chiswick this â 
morning,, and the circumstances point to an attempt to discover the design and jealously guarded secrets 3
of the construction of Sir Thomas Lipton'B racing yacht, the Shamrock, which is there building, and Â§
i â ââ â with which Sir Thomas hopes to bring the America cup back to English waters. - â¢ ;gj
t The two men put out from Hammersmith in a skiff, which they had engaged. overnight on the rather thin 8
excuse of a fishing excursion. After landing just by the side of the Shamrock's slip two officers placed them g
I under arrest. ''-~l ''i\-':-'Â¥\' rj,
I It was discovered that, in addition to a kodak, they had a supply of ground bait a very attractive char- ft
acter. There was in particular a set of skeleton yacht plans, already marked at points where the dimensions 88

After spending some hours at the police station the two young fishermen were allowed to go. The films of ft
the camera and the skelton plans were retained. â¢ Although the names are kept. secret, a Daily Mail reporter un- Â£8

JUSTICE FIELD IS
SUMMONED TO THE
SILENT MAJORITY
Continued from First Page.
very glad to hear it, for I have a note
of my brother's, David Dudley Field,
here against you," and he thereupon
showed him the note. The man's face
fell, but he had been blowing to such an
extent about making money that he
could not refuse to pay it. He looked
the note over, and â  then at last, in a
sharp tone, said: "That's my signature,"
and he thereupon paid the full amount
with interest.
Then Field entered Into the practice of
his profession. He was one of the found
ers of Marysville in this State, becom
ing its first alcalde, and continuing as
such until the organization of the judi
ciary under the constitution of the Slate.
At Marysville he had some of the most
thrilling experiences of a stirring career.
At one time Judge Turner swore he
would drive Field into the Yuba River.
Field was advised to buy a shotgun -and
kill Turner on sight. He replied that he
would not, do that, and that he could
only act in self-defense. He bought, how
ever, a couple of revolvers and practiced
firing at a mark by shooting through his
clothes, holding the pistol in his pocket.
He says that he soon acquired consider
able skill, and was able to. hit a small
object across the street. He thinks he
could have hit a man easily, and could
have killed at almost every shot. He
then sent a warning to Turner, saying
that he would not avoid him nor would
he seek any collision with him, but that
if he dared attack him or come near him
in a threatening manner he would kill
him. Judge Turner, upon learning of Mr.
Field's skill with a revolver, did not seek
to carry out his threats. Be was Justice
of the court, however, and he disbarred
Field from practice.
Shortly after this Justice Field was
elected to the Legislature. Here he was
.in such danger that he had to have his
: pistols Â»always at hand In the drawer of
his desk -in the legislative hall. He also
practiced in courts where every lawyer
carried a pistol or a bowie knife and was
once challenged by a Judge to fight a
duel. He accepted the challenge, and as
he had the choice of weapons stated that
the fight should be held in a room twenty
feet square, each man to have a Colt's
revolver and a bowie knife. The two
principals were to use the revolvers first
and then the bowie knives. To these
terms the challenged party would not
consent and the duel was off. He was
elected a member of the first Legislature
held after the admission of California Into
the Union, served on its Judiciary Com
mittee and secured the passage of laws
concerning the judiciary and regulating
civil and criminal procedure in all the
courts of the State. He was also the
author of the law that gives authority
to the regulations and customs of miners
in the settlement of Controversies among
them, thus solving a perplexing problem.
At the close of that session he returned
to Marysville. and during the ensuing six
years devoted himself to his profession,
gaining an extensive practice.
In 1867 Field was elected Judge of the
Supreme Court of California for six
years, beginning with January, 1858, but
on the occurrence of a vacancy he was
appointed to fill that office in October,
1867. On the resignation of Chief Justice
David S. Terry in September, 1889. Judge
Field succeeded him and continued in of
fice till his appointment to the Supreme
bench of the United States by President
Lincoln in 1863.
In this regard It should be observed
that Judge Field was, with one exception,
the latest surviving occupant of a Fed
eral bench who served under a commis
sion issued by President Lincoln. The ex
ception in this Instance is Judge Henry-
Clay Caldwell of the United States Circuit
Court. _.
Among the prominent decisions In which
he has been concerned was the famous
test oath case, In which he gave the cast
ing vote and wrote the opinion of the
court, annulling the validity of the "iron
clad" oath. His dissenting opinions in
the legal tender cases, in 'the confiscation
cases and in the New Orleans slaughter
house case, also attracted attention.
Judge Field was a member of the Elec
toral Commission in 1877, and voted with
the Democratic minority in the commis
sion on the "Hayes-Tilden contest. :
In 1880 Judge Field was a candidate for
the Presidential nomination before the
Democratic National Convention at Cin
cinnati, and he received on the first ballot
65 votes.
In 1873 he was appointed by the Gover
nor of this State one of a commission to
examine the California code of law3;and
to prepare amendments for the 'sarao for
legislative action. He received the de
gree of LL.D. from Williams College in
1864. and in 1869 was appointed professor
of law in the University of California,
Special interest was lent to- Judge
Field's career by his connection with the
circumstances which culminated in the
death of ex-Judge Terry August 14,-1889.
Justice Field's direct connection with
Terry assumed tangible. form when the
suit of Sarah Althea Hill was filed against
Senator Sharon for divorce -and alimony
aggregating several millions. Terry was
the plaintiff's counsel. A legal entangle
ment took the case to the United States
Circuit Court. During the litigation
Terry married the plaintiff. His interest
in the case was thus intensified by per
sonal Influence. > When Justice Field
rendered the decision defeating the plain
tiff's suit Terry manifested no little re
sentment.
Afterward It was reported that Terry
meditated personal violence toward the
Federal Judge. The United States Mar
shal was officially notified and Instructed
to protect Justice FMd's life against
what jeopardy it might ' be ln. United
States Deputy Marshal Nagle was ap
pointed to accompany the Justice on his
trips through the circuit. .
At Lathrop, while Justice Field was
seated at a table, Terry and his wife en
tered. The story Is that Terry approach
ed the Justice In a menacing manner,
made a motion to, or did. slap him, and
Nagle shot and .killed Terry. The State
courts sought to try the Deputy Marshal,
but tho Federal ' tribunals, by a writ of
habeas corpus, took him from the cus
tody of the local authorities and he was
tried and acquitted of the charge of
murder. . > .
Judge Field has boon one of the most
noted Democrats of the United States.
He has been several times spoken of for
the Preftldency, and yet he held to his
place for years after ho woe entitled to
retirement with full pay because he
would not permit President Cleveland,
also a Democrat, to have the appointment
of his successor. This feeling, grew from
Field's resentment at the thwarting by
Cleveland of the JudS-'B ambition to pre-.
6lde over the court In which he. had so
long, sat as 'a member, *â¢â  " â¢' -â¢:.'--â¢*.
When Chief Justice Waite died petitions
came in from the.- lawyers from ail parts,
of the country asking that Judge Field
be made Waite's successor. Many of the
legal organizations passed resolution- to
thjs effect, â  but President Cleveland
stepped aside and chose Melville W. Ful
ler, a Chicago' lawyer. Who had .hardly
achieved a national reputation. This was
a very. bitter pill to Justice Field's friends
and, to the Justice himself. Field never
forgave Cleveland this. Asked, upon one
occasion what had prompted the slight.
he said he had no personal knowledge of
the President's mind in the matter but
that he had understood from a number
of reliable sources that Cleveland at that
time was very anxious for a second nomi
nation. In order to secure this he had
to build up his strength in the Northwest
and in the region about Chicago. A new
Chief Justice was to be appointed, and the
appointment was used to this end. Vilas,
who was then in the. Cabinet, advised
Cleveland that Fuller had many friends
and that he could be of great service to
the administration, and Judge Field was
told that It was for this reason chiefly
that the appointment was made.
On December 1, 1897, Justice Field re
tired from the Supreme bench and was
succeeded by Joseph McKenna of Cali
fornia, at that time Attorney General in
the McKinley Cabinet.
Justice Field tendered his resignation
in April, 1897, to take effect December 1.
The President in his letter of acceptance
of the resignation said: "Upon your re
tirement both the bench and the court
and country will sustain a great loss, but
the high character and ability of your
work will live and long be remembered,
not only by your colleagues but by your
grateful fellow-countrymen."
The Justice made the formal announce
ment of his resignation to his colleagues
on the bench in a long letter sketching
his own and the court's history during
his extended service. In one part â  he
said: "It is a pleasant thing in my mem
ory that' my appointment came from
President Lincoln, of whose appointees I
am the last surviving. Up to that time
there had been no representative here of
the Pacific Coast. A new empire had
arisen in the West, whose laws were
those of another country. The land titles
were from Spanish and Mexican grants,
both pf which were often overlaid fay the
claims of the first settlers. To bring
order out of this confusion,. Congress
passed an act providing for another seat
on this bench, with the .intention that it
should be. filled by some one familiar with
these conflicting titles and with the min
ing laws of the coast, and as it so hap
pened that I had .tamed the principal of
those laws an.l was, moreover. Chief Jus
tice of California, it was the wish of the
Senators and Representatives of that
State, as well as those from Oregon, that
1 should succeed to the new position. At
their request. Mr. Lincoln sent my name
to the Senate and the' nomination was
unanimously confirmed."
During his incumbency he said he alone
had written 620 opinions, which, with 57
in the Circuit Court and 365 in the Cali
fornia Supreme Court, made up a total
of 1042 cases decided by him during his
life. He took issue with the styling of
the court as an aristocratic feature of a
republican government, and said- it was
the most democratic of all. '"It carries,"
he wrote, "neither the purse nor the
sword, but it possesses the power of de
claring the law. and that is found the
safeguard which keeps the whole mighty
fabric of government from rushing to
destruction."
The court replied in a very feeling let
ter, and later called in a body and bade
him farewell. Since his retirement he has
lived quietly In his old Washington home
facing the Capitol grounds.
FUNERAL SERVICE OVER
SIX VICTIMS OF FIRE
Members .of the Andrews and St.
John. Families Interred at
New York.
NEW YORK, April 9.â The funeral serv
ices over the remains of the members of
the family of Wallace C. Andrews and G.
C. St. John, who perished in Friday
morning's fire, were held at the Fifth
avenue homo of the Andrews family this
afternoon. From 1 o'clock until after the
funeral cortege had started on Its way to
the Grand Central station, two hours
later, Fifth avenue in the vicinity of the
Andrews home was choked by a surging
and curious crowd. Fifty policemen kept
the immense throng in order.
The caskets containing the remains of
the dead, six in all, were placed in the
back parlor of the palatial residence and
arranged in the shape of a crescent.. In
the center was the casket containing the
remains of Mrs. St. John; on either side
of her and a little to the rear were those
of her two baby sons, Wallace and Or
son. On the outside, to. the right of Mrs.
St. -John's casket, , was that of Mr. An
drews, while on the other side was that of
his wife. At the foot of his mother's cof
fin was that of Frederick St. John. All
of the caskets were almost hidden by
flowers.
There were no ceremonies save the ora
tion delivered by Professor Adler of the
Ethical Culture Society, nor was there
any music. All was plain and simple, in
accordance with 'the wishes of Mr. St.
John. At the conclusion of the services
the caskets were taken to Woodlawn
Cemetery by a special train. The pall
bearers were Russel Sage, General Bur
nett, Colonel Robert _. Ingersoll James

The withdrawal of the eigh

LAWTON EXPECTED- TO <: r^
CAPTURE SANTA CRUZ
WASHINGTON,. April The War
Department authorities look for im
portant news from Manila to-morrow
announcing, in all probability, the cap
ture of- the city of Santa Cruz, a lead
ing town in a country as yet untouched
by the American forces and now in the
hands of the Filipino forces. No re
port of the movements of General Law
ton's men has been made to the War
Department, but the Associated Press
announcement occasioned no surprise,
for the move is looked upon as one of
the natural steps in General Otis' care
fully laid plans against the insurgents.
Santa Cruz is a place of considerable
importance in several respects. It Is
the capital of the Province- of La Guna.
and has a population, according to the
best available information here, of con
siderably more than 13.000 persons.
It is regarded as likely that General
Lawton already has gained possession
of this stronghold, for it is but a short
distance over the bay lagoon, a fresh
water sea, which comes almost up to
Manila itself, which is forty-eight miles
away from Santa Cruz. The details
of the dispatch show General Lawton
in essaying the formation of squads of
twelve men each, which will make a
thorough reconnoissance o. the ground
before making a definite attack upon
the city. It is felt here that there will
be only a show of resistance by the
natives, and whether they actually sur
render the town or abandon it to the
southward, the campaign against the
place will serve as an object lesson of
the determined policy of our forces in
the island.
Santa Cruz is apparently an opening
wedge for the country beyond. From
it leads highways in all directions,, to
Manila by going around the shores of
the bay lagoon, and to the important
point of Batangas and the well ad
vanced Province of Tayabaz, whose
capital city is located ninety-two miles
from Manila, General Lawton, how
ever, may not contemplate any ma
terial advance beyond Santa Cruz at
this time, as the region to the south Is
a very broken country, ' covered with
mountains and the rainy season is com
ing on, so that his purpose may be
merely to gain an advantage of our po
sition for the future.

MANY UNFIT FOR
IMMEDIATE SERVICE
Correspondence of the Associated Press.
ON BOARD THE UNITED STATES
ARMY TRANSPORT GRANT, SINGA
PORE, M/irch The officers of the de
tachment of troops which the Grant is
hurrying to reinforce the American
army at Manila make no secret of the
fact that their men are not fit fdr im- !
mediate service. Hardly 25 per cent of
the Fourth infantry and the battalion j
of the Seventeenth on board the Grant i
are veterans. The others are recruits, J
all of whom were enlisted within two
months of sailing from Nw- York and j
some of whom were taken in during !
the last day or. t two. Their drill has
been limited to what the small deck |
space of a crowded transport will allow,
and during the first month of the voy- I
age it amounted to little more than
"setting up" exercises.
Save for the recurrence of Cuban
fever, which frequently attacks even
veterans, the physical condition of the
troops is excellent. . '..',*

DEWEY A SAILOR,
NOT A POLITICIAN
j NEW YORK, April Admiral Dewey
has given to the Manila correspondent
! of Leslie's Weekly an interview regard
! ing the suggestion that the admiral be
j made a candidate for the Presidency
' next year. The admiral said as to his
| politics: ( .
"I am a sailor. A sailor has no poli
. tics. The administration is his party,
1 and, Republican or Democratic, : it
makes no difference. Then, again, I
come from Vermont, and ' you know
what that means.. To be anything but
a Republican .in Vermont is to be a
man without a party. My flag lieuten
ant comes from Georgia. He tells me
that to be anything but a Democrat in
the South- is to be a nobody. If I lived
South 1 would probably be a Demo
crat."
"Have you ever voted?" the corre
spondent asked.
"Yes, years ago; but my vote was
usually Influenced by personal prefer
ence or local conditions. I am not a
politician, have never held political
office and am totally ignorant of party
i intricacies or affiliation-."
Admiral Dewey said that neither by
vocation, disposition, education nor
training was he capacitated to rill the
Presidency. He said that he was too
well along in life to consider such a
possibility. His health would not admit
of it. All his life's work .was in differ
ent lines of effort, and that while the
kindness and enthusiasm of his friends
were grateful to him and the generous
tributes of the American people were
dear to him, he could not and would
not be a candidate for the Presidency
of the United States under any condi
tions. .â ââ ' : ', ;: ' â â  â

ANACONDA. Mont., April Spe
cials to the Standard from various
parts of Montana show that the recent
chinook has made raging torrents of
most of the rivers, in many cases break
ing all records. The Yellowstone has
caused the greatest loss of life and
property. Ice jams have backed the
water up at Glendive and Miles City,
where the greatest damage has been
done.
At Miles City the ice jammed at the
mouth of Tongue River, forcing the
water back until the entire south side
of the city was under water. Seventy
five houses had to be abandoned, the
people haAing to be rescued in boats,
so quick had been the rise of the water.
Later in the afternoon the water broke
over the track into Main street, which
ran a torrent.
Dynamite has been used and it is
supposed the wash is over. The loss
cannot yet be estimated.
Washouts are reported all along the
Northern Pacific and passenger trains
are stalled all along the line, but the
details are slow In coming In.

PROSPECTS BETTER FOR
WAR THAN PEACE
Diplomats Say That the Czar Is Pre-

Seems Inevitable.
NEW YORK. April 9.â A special to the
I Sun from Washington says: The forth
coming conference at The Hague over the
â¢ Czar's proposal to suspend further mill
i tary armament of the nations is a topic
. of frequent discussion among members of
i the diplomatic corps at Washington. The
| general opinion is that nothing definite
will come of the conference. One prominent
diplomat thinks the time is most Inoppor
tune, believing the prospects are much
better for a general war than for unl-
A-ersal peace.
"Each day's news," he says, "makes a
war more probable, and when one does
come It will be a big one. I am unable
to see why the nations should accept In
all seriousness the proposition for peace
from such a madman as the Czar of Rus
sia is well known to be. Why, eA-en while
making his protestations for peace he Is
using every means to increase his war
power, so when the crash that he well
knows is inevitable and which he Is try
ing to ward off does come Russia will be
able to hold her own, at least."

â¦+â¦*â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦
PARIS April 9.â The testimony
of General Billot, former Minis
ter of War, before the Court of
Cassation in the Dreyfus case,
as published in the Figaro, Avas
mainly of a negative character
and did not contain any neAv
facts, except the assertion that
the brothers of Dreyfus told Gen
eral Sandherr on December 13,
1894,- that they were ready to
offer their whole fortune for the
discovery of the real culprit.
This was the beginning of the
Dreyfus campaign taken up by
Colonel Picquart.
â¦â¦â¦++++++++â¦+â¦+â¦
PARIS, April 9.â Premier Dupuy, in
the course of an important speech to
his constituents to-day at Le Puy, said
the situation both at home and abroad
was eminently satisfactory.. He referred
approvingly to the recent agreements
Avith Italy and Great Britain and said
France Avas "now free for industrial
and commercial development and a
large field of colonizing." Reverting to
home affairs, he said:
"The agitations are only on the sur
face. Beneath are calm, industry and
security. The end of the Dreyfus af
fair appears to be in sight and the com
plication Avill be unraveled by the
Court of Cassation, whose judgment
will be acknoAvledged by all. .
"The Government, hoAvever, attaches
Importance to reiterating its determina
tion to repress all polemics which call
the national army into question. As
soon as the . Court of Cassation has
given judgment the Government will
take the necessary measures to deter
mine responsibilities and will act ac
cordingly, if that should be necessary,
but these acts and the punishment of
individual faults will not affect the
army, Avhich is our hope for the future
and the Indispensable guardian of the
constitution and the laAV.
"If certain. people think otherwise let
us leave them to their despicable folly
and for ourselves continue to look to
ward the army, full of gratitude and
confidence."
Continuing its publication of the eA-i
--dence given before the Court of Cassation
in the Dreyfus case, the Figaro gives to
day the depositions of General Zurlinden,
Military Governor of Paris, and General
Chanolne, formerly War Minister.
General Zurlinden deposed that when he
etnered the Cabinet last autumn he knew
nothing of the Dreyfus affair, but the sui
cide of Lieutenant Colonel Henry pro
voked him to study the dossier, which
convinced him that Dreyfus was justly
condemned. Therefore the documents In
the dossier proved, he declared, that the
traitor belonged to the general staff.
There was no malice in the designation of
the culprit, and therefore the legend of
the "entrapped Jew", must be set aside.
General Zurlinden proceeded to show
by technical details that the particulars
Indicated in the bordereau were highly
Important to a foreign nation. With ref
erence to the phrase, " am going to the
maneuvers." in the bordereau, he said the
military students were wont to attend the
maneuvers, but on August 27. 1?94, the day
to which the phrase In the bordereau re
ferred, they did not attend. This fact, he
said, he regarded as having great bearing
on the dlscoA-ery of the author of the
bordereau.
Proof of the culpability of Dreyfus, he
Insisted, existed outside the depositions
of Lieutenant Colonel Henry and Colonel
Paty dv Clam, and he appealed to the
court to reject revision, which, he said,
he would have demanded himself in the
name of .the army if he had or did have
the slightest doubt of the guilt of Drey
fus. He knew nothing, he asserted, of
the relations between Comte Esterhazy,
Lieutenant Colonel Henry and Colonel
Sanherr, or of the communication of
secret documents to the court-martial ln
189*. nor had he any knowledge respect
ing the correctness of such rumors. In
conclusion he remarked that the whole
army wished the fullest light to be
thrown upon the affair.
General Chanoine testified that he had
examined all the dossiers placed at his
disposal, and that these, in his judgment,
established the culpability of Dreyfus.
He also deposed that he had spoken on
the subject with many persons who were
acquainted with the circumstances of the
trial in 1594. ___-

TENSION OF RELATIONS
Incidents That Indicate the Bad Feel-

Special Cable to The Call and the New York

STOCKHOLM, April The tension v of
the relations between Sweden and Nor
way is Indicated by the following inci
dents:
During the Crown Prince's recent visit
to Christianla he invited the members of
the Chambers to dinner at the Royal
Castle. About sixty of them rudely re
turned the Invitations. The Crown Prlnco
was naturally highly offended, and spoke
Indignantly of their act, which, to say
the least, was ungentlemanly.
The Swedish Minister of War, as usual,
asked the permission of his Norwegian
colleague to delegate a couple of officers
to attend the autumn maneuvers In Nor
way. To the surprise of all here the per
mission was refused.
The Crown Princess is suffering from
Inflammation in her eyes, and her doctors
have forbidden reading.

RABBI SCKULMAN
AGAINST ZIONISM
Vigorously Attacks the
Movement.
IS REPUGNANT TO JUDAISM
THE SCHEME DECLARED TO BE
VISIONARY.
Proposed Establishment of an Inde
pendent Hebrew State in Pales
tine Denounced as
Repugnant.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, April 9.-Rev. Samuel
Schulman, associate rabbi of Temple
Beth-El, delivered a vigorous attack
this morning upon the Zionistic move
ment. The movement alms at the es
tablishment of an Independent HebreAv
state in Palestine in order to express
the unity of the Hebrew nationality.
In the beginning of his discourse the
rabbi described the scattering of He
brews over the civilized world after the
destruction of the second temple by the
Romans, the persecutions in the middle
ages and the benificent effects Avhich
the French revolution had in â¢ giving
recognition to the Hebrews and protect
ing them by legislation. The result has
been that the Hebrews felt that any
part of the Avorld could be their coun
try and they could love It Avith the nat
ural attachment of one born on its soil.
Continuing, Dr. Schulman said:
"To the occidental Jew, thus dena
tionalized, a great surprise has come
in the movement which has been agi
tated during the last two years, which
Is knoAvn as Zionism.,- Providence has
taught us during the last hundred years
not to go back further into the past;
that the best field for developing the
JeAvish spirit to its full poAvers and to
do our mission adequately ln the world
is in Europe and America, Avhere JeAV
ish genius is to be married to non-JeAV
ish culture. v " .l"'
"The purpose of the movement to re
establish JeAvish nationality is not only
visionary, but it is repugnant to Juda
ism as a religion. It is visionary be
cause neither the money needed to buy
the land from the Sultan can be pro
cured, nor will the powers of Europe
consent to a resurrection of Jewish na
tionality. It is repugnant to Judaism
because, while -* orthodoxy officially
prays for Palestine, it Avalts for the
coming of the Messiah."

â  LONDON. April 10.â The St. Petersburg correspondent of the Daily
& Telegraph says: A very serious situation, which has recently developed
ft in the Province of Kasan, in Southeastern Russia, a territory inhabited
88 principally by Tartars, is likely to result in a general uprising. Famine
8 and typhus, that have long been devastating the .Volga territory, created
ft such terrible havoc in that province that the Government was compelled
SiÃ to send aid, food and Red Cross sanitary agents.
5 Unfortunately, rumors were circulated Avith the assistance of
ft fanatical priests, that the representatives of the Government really
â¢8 wanted to convert the Mahommedans. A genuine religious panic en
-6 sued and the Government's agents everywhere met with a hostile recen
w tion, being stoned and otherwise maltreated, so that it became Impos
es sible to distribute the aid sent. The Government is now endeavoring to
ft reassure the misguided Tartars. -..-.;_;!.'".,

TRUSTS WILL BE
MADE THE ISSUE
Plans of Leaders of the
Democracy.
SILVER TO BE SUBORDINATED
.
-
BRYAN AND HIS HOBBY MUST
BE SIDETRACKED.
Attempt Will Be Made to Charge the
Republican Party With Pos
tering Centralization of
Capital.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, April The Washing
ton correspondent of the Herald tele
graphs:
"Down with the trusts" will be the
battle cry of the Democrats in the next
Presidential campaign, if the plans of
some of the leading men in that party
can be carried out.
When Mr. Bryan was nominated in
1896 an effort was made to have him
subordinate the sliver Issue in his cam
paign and put opposition to the trusts
in the foreground. It was urged that,
if he would do this, he could hold in
line many of the Democrats in the
East who would not folloAV him in op
position to sound money. He re
fused to take this course, and went
doAvn to defeat on the silver issue. Now
the same element of the party is trying
to sidetrack Mr. Bryan and put up
some other man on a platform in Avhich
the silver issue will be subordinate to
the trust issue.
Republican politicians are alive to
the situation, and some of the shrewd-
est men In the party believe that steps
should be taken at once to put the
party in a position to meet the opposi
tion on this issue.
Representative Landis of Indiana,
â who has returned to Washington after
a visit to his district, talked yesterday
With Secretary Gage and other mem
bers of the administration, urging that
some action be taken at once to put the
party on record against trust. He said
the people of the Middle West were
aroused in antagonism to the trusts;
that small Interests were being sacri
ficed and that if the administration did
not in some way, not to be misunder
stood, avoAA- its antagonism to the
trusts, the question Avould become very
, prominent in the next campaign and
dangerous to the Republican party in
that section. . 0
Mr. Leandis is not the only man who
hopes that the administration will be
placed on record squarely in opposi
tion to trusts, and while it will not be
admitted that the present activity of
the Department of Justice in 'institut
ing suits under the anti-trust law is
intended for political effect there is rea
son to believe it is largely due to a de
sire on the part of the administration
to have a record to point to that will
contradict any charge that may be
made by the Democrats that the Re
publican party favors and fosters trusts
and combinations of capital. Consider
able progress has already been made in
the direction of making a record for
the administration in opposition to
trusts. .:-â¢'- t
Since Mr. McKinley became President
the two most important suits that have
been Avon by the Government under the
anti-trust laAVâ Traffic Association
suitsâ been decided by the Su
preme Court of the United States. An
other important caseâ that of the pipe
trust is now before the court, and
within the last week a suit has been
brought in Cincinnati by direction of
the Department of Justice against the
Chesapeake and Ohio Association,
which controls the- output of the soft
coal mines of the Kanawaha Valley in
West Virginia. ;./- -f.v: .;-
Other trusts are under investigation
by the department and it is probable
suits Avill be instituted. If either the
pipe trust case or the Chesapeake and
Ohio case is Avon by the Government a
precedent Avill be established that, will
enable successful suits to' be instituted
against many more trusts and combina
tions. . 'i-v-i'y
Whether these suits are won or not
the Republican party will be able in the
next campaign to' meet the Democratic
charges by pointing to the record of the
administration in the enforcement of
the anti-trust law. It will be contended
that everything has been done by the
McKinley administration that is pos
sible under, the anti-trust law, which
enables the Attorney General to pro
ceed against trusts only when they
operate as a restraint upon commerce
between. the States or with foreign
countries. â  . â 
GEORGE TRIES
â¢ HYPNOTISM ON JURORS
Said to Have Placed Talesmen Under
the Spell By Her Smiles .
and Her Eyes.
CANTON, Ohio, April 9.â Rumors were
freely circulated here to-night to the ef
fect that trouble was being worked in
the jury box In the Mrs. George murder
trial by the hypnotic influence of the de
fendant. One story, which was repeated
with confidence, but without a name, had
it that one of the rejected talesmen had
changed his mind after he had been sum
moned for examination. This change had
been brought about, he said, by Mrs.
George, who, by gazing at him, had placed
him under a spell and made him sub
servient to her will.
Attorneys for the defense scout these
rumors as utterly preposterous. Attor
neys for the prosecution, on the other
hand, say there is no doubt that Mrs.
George believes she has the power of hyp
notism. Mr. Pomerene said to-night that
the defendant has sought to influence the
jury by her smiles and the power of her
eyes, and every one connected with tho
trial of the case. He expressed no fear
of her success, however, and said that her
conduct could have no other result than
to prejudice her case.

INDUSTRIALS, STAPLES fIND CROPS.
Till- expected has happened in Wall street Over-
I capitalization has been called down; by the banks.
* The, rebuke was', brief, but very much to the
point. The function took place on Fridayâ a Very
good day for such affairs and for a few hours the
street was in an uproar;' prices for the industrials
-dropped like plumblines and a good many lamb
'speculators' were wiped off the street.
To those who -watch the mainsprings of business
the liquidation was not surprising. Along last fall
the commercial agencies called attention to the ten
dency. to form all sorts of trusts, out of all sorts of
material. After the turn of the' year this tendency
became marked, and a few weeks ago assumed the
proportions of a raze. Then the banks began to look
cross-eyed at industrial combinations, and. this was the
beginning of the end. The bankers objected to; the.
wholesale locking up of millions in enterprises, some
ol them sterling, but many visionary. he money
market, slowly hardened' and interest rates .went up.
Finally the .banks began to' reject the industrials as
a class as collateral, "the brokers could not carry their
customers on account of this lack of bank accommo
dation and begad to realize. This, of course, alarmed
the street, everybody rushed in to sell and there was
an old-fashioned break. But it did not last long. The I
sterling industrials, though considerably shaken up,
weathered the tempest all right, and the others col
lapsed. In two or three hours the atmosphere cleared,
blocks of capital rushed in and stemmed the break,
prices reacted and the flurry was over.
At no time during this episode of the combinations
were the standard industrials under suspicion. They
are solid and safe. But there were too many irons in
the fire for the safety of the market and the banks
quietly drew them out. The market will probably be
on a better basis from now on. A gratifying feature
of the whole business was its brevity and the ease with
which the financial sky cleared, showing that the
finances of the country arc on a sound foundation.
The commercial situation stands about the same as
on the. preceding week. Business is reported quieter,
but the bank clearings of the country show a gain of
59.7 per cent over the same week in 1898, and not a
single large city shows a falling off in trade according
to these clearings. The failures were 100, against 220
for the same week last year. But the leading staples
are quieter, and even the iron trade has slackened up,
though this is said to be due to lack of supplies, and
not to any cessation of the demand, which is still]
enormous and which has led to the starting up of
forty-eight more furnaces. This latter feature has
tended to ease the market by promising increased sup
plies later on. Boots and shoes are reported very
active and lumber is as firm as ever. There is no
particular change in the- wool and cotton trades.
Wheat has been irregular, and during the past few
days reports of serious damage to the crop in many
States by the February freeze have multiplied. It is
admitted that the crop outlook is not as brilliant as
it was several months ago, except in California, where
the prospects are excellent. Meanwhile there has
been a slight shrinkage in quotations.
The local situation stands about the same. Busi
ness is very good, and no complaints are heard. It
is now pretty well settled that with one or two excep
tions the harvest of cereals and fruits will be very
large this year, and this gives everybody unbounded
confidence in the future. Some districts will need
another shower or two to mature the crops, but others
can go through without any more rain, especially
north of the bay. It is equally settled that the fruit
crop of the Eastern and Western States will be "al
most a total failure this year, and in most of the great
peach States the trees themselves were killed by the
February freeze. All fruits, even apples, will be short,
and as stocks of canned rind dried fruit are reduced to
almost nothing all over the country the outlook for a
prosperous fruit year in California is brilliant. Indeed,
buyers are already looking about for fruit, and $75
per ton is reported bid for apricots in several dis
tricts. If, this figure proves true and other fruits are
equally desired, 1899 will be the banner year for the
California fruit-grower. . '
Our boys in Manila will have to make a good many
speedy marches during the next month, for they are
raring against time as well as against the Filipino
and are bound by the terms of the campaign to over
take the native runners before the rainy season sets in.

DEATH OF STEPHEN J. \ FIELD.
THE death of Judge Field in his 83 year, after the
longest judicial career of any Justice of the Su
preme Court of the United States, commits a life
of great labor and of marked eminence' to the calm
prbiirament of history. The main facts that will enter
into his biography are elsewhere recapitulated. His
judicial standing, originally acquired in this State,
became national, and there is no p*art of the United
States in which his passage from time to eternity will
not excite interest and comment.
He came fiom revolutionary stock. His fathe
was a distinguished clergyman. He was one of five
brothers, all of whom were exceptionally gifted and
noted. He was classically educated, and spent two
years r thereabouts of his earlier life in Greece, In
_-B_7 lie graduated in the first ram-; from Williams
College. For four years he applied himself to pre
paratory law studies and in 1841 was admitted to the
bar of New York. For eight years he was in partner
ship with his elder brother, David Dudley Field, who
was numb-red among the great lawyers of the Union.
In 1849, after a second visit to Europe, he came to
California, and arrived barely in time to escape ex
clusion from. the Society of California Pioneers.
In 1850 the record of Judge Field's activities fairly
begins. His' 'possession of unusual mental power,
especially .adapted to the profession he selected, and
his thorough comprehension of principles and knowl
edge of technicalities have never been questioned.
Possessed of these advantages, at the age of 33 he
took his place among the pioneers of this State, who,
in proportion to their numbers, combined intelligence,
education and energy in a degree to which the history
of new communities furnishes no parallel. The
adaptation of American institutions and American law
to the conditions established by the Mexican rule,
and especially in relation to land tenures, also pro
duced litigation of original impression and of vast im
portance, which demanded and obtained for its solu
tion legal capacity of the highest order.
Judge Field had scarcely reached Marysville, where
he first settled, when he became a judicial officer
through an election as Alcalde or Judge of the Court
of First Instance, and to strengthen his authority he
was also appointed and commissioned as a Justice of
the Peace. His earliest practical service, however,
to the State was in a legislative capacity. As a
member of the Assembly he prepared the two prac
tice acts, civil and criminal, which, as amended and
supplemented, regulated the local administration of
the law until the adoption of the codes. He also
framed legislation for the protection of miners and
the mining interests, upon which one of the most im
portant departments of our State jurisprudence has
been chiefly based.
.â¢After years of lucrative practice, in which his suc
cess in appealed cases raised him above most of his
j contemporaries, in 1857 he was elected to the Supreme
Bench, where he served for about six years, and with
his able coadjutors, first as an Associate Justice and
afterward as Chief Justice, contributed to the elevation
of our highest tribunal to a dignity which commanded
respect not only throughout the Union but abroad.
Politically, he was a Democrat, and when the Civil
War broke out he threw his intellect and his influence
on the side of the Union. In 1863 he was appointed
by President Lincoln one of the Justices of the Su
preme Court of the United States and was assigned to
the Tenth Circuit. It bad been anticipated that the ap-
It-nero would be tendered to Oscar L. Shafter, one
of. the greatest lawyers and purest citizens that the
''â¢Union- has - produced. This fact alone shows the
weight and the influence by which Judge Field was
backed.
Transferred from the Supreme Court of the State
to the Supreme Court of the nation, a tribunal that in
the extent of its jurisdiction and in the novelty and
intricacy of the questions it is required to determine,
has no equal on the globe, the opportunities of Judge
Field for the illustration of his judicial strength were
enhanced by the heavy and complicated litigation,
involving searching constitutional interpretations, that
followed the close of the Civil War. He proved equal
to every occasion, and though frequently in a minority
and subjected to severe criticisms for some of the In
cisions in which he participated he left an indelible
impression upon the jurisprudence of his country.
His vote determined and his opinion expressed the
decision of the Supreme Court of the United States
against test- oaths, which overturned the decision of
our own Supreme' Court upon a similar question. He
wrote prevailing opinions in a large number of leading
cases. His dissenting opinions in' the legal tender
cases, in the confiscation cases, in the slaughter
house case and in other controversies of equal sig
nificance, would alone have ranked him among the
able judges of the century.
- He was a member of the electoral commission of
1877, which decided the conflict between Hayes and
Tilden, and was one of the minority 01 seven, in
1880 he received 85 votes for Presidential nominee in
the Democratic National Convention. During his ju
dicial life many honorary distinctions were conferred
upon him which it would be impracticable to enu
merate, i
He possessed the faculty of judicial reasoning in an
eminent degree, but in his personal character he was
extremely positive, aggressive and unconciliatoryi
Consequently he made warm and true friends, but also
persistent and bitter enemies. At Marysville he quar
reled with Judge Turner, and for months their mu
tual animosity was vented in the courts and on the
streets. In the Legislature possible ' bloodshed be
tween himself and one of his fellow members was only
averted by the decided action of David C. Broderick.
who was among his closest and dearest friends. While
on the Supreme Bench the stabbing of Charles S.
Fairfax, clerk of the court, by Harvey Lee was due to
a struggle between the Court and the Governor for
the appointment of an official reporter, in which Judge
Field was conspicuous. The episode of the killing of
Judge Terry at Lathrop is still fresh in the public
memory.
This is not the time nor place minutely to analyze J
the character and the acts of Judge Field in their bear
ing, upon popular rights and upon questions affecting j
the integrity of American institutions. The opinions

AN INGLORIOUS CONTROVERSY.
ABOUT the only gratifying feature of the con
troversy over Samoa is i the promptness with
which the Governments of the three powers have
arranged for a joint commission to settle it and put
an end to it, , From first to last the whole train of
events leading up to the' present crisis has been in
glorious to civilization, and the only way for the
United State?, Great Britain and Germany. to get any
credit out of it at all is to close.it up quietly and say
no more about it.
With the laudable ambition of taking up the "white

nun's burden" and serving the brown, men of .the
South, Seas, the .merchants, and the. missionaries of
Germany, of -England and of the United. States we.it
to the Samoan Islands and began to trade and to
teach. Their ostensible mission was to promote the
material and spiritual welfare of the natives, and as
a fiim foundation on which to build they announced
that first of all they would establish and maintain
peace. Then the trouble began.
So far from keeping peace among the natives, the
civilized protectors of the islands could not keep
peace among themselves. Before the advent of the
whites the natives had no cause of quarrel except to
determine which of two rival chiefs had the stronger
following. When one side whipped the other the
quarrel ended.
With the whites came all the quarrels of civiliza
tion. There arose trade rivalries, issues of prestige
and precedence and questions concerning the best
means of getting to heaven. Merchants and mission
aries mixed in a wrangle. The native had a new cause
for war every week and sometimes two a week. These
causes, moreover, cannot be settled by fighting it out
in one battle, because being issues of principle, they
survive the arguments of club and sword and remain
incentives to incessant war.
At last all parties are agreed that the only way for
the three powers to bear the white man's burden in
peace is to separate the burden bearers. Now the
proper way to do justice in the- matter would be to
send the disturbers out of the islands and leave the
Samoans in possession of their country, their inde
pendence and their trade. Such a course, however,
would be a surrender of the white man's burden, and
the conscience of diplomacy revolts at such an aban
donment of duty. So we are to disrupt Samoa, divide
its people and rearrange peace on a new basis.
Fortunately, the end of the dreary business seems
near. All the powers have agreed to a conference.
A member of the Berlin Foreign Office is quoted as
having recently said: "The German member of the
commission has not yet been selected, but we shall
send a man who is eminently conciliatory, for we are
determined to make peace." The United States and
Great Britain are undoubtedly animated by the same
sentiment, and the commission will be harmonious â
perhaps.
WHERE THE BLAME RESTS.
IT is the opinion of the Oregonian that the Pacific
Coast is "the football of Congress." It says: "If
the Pacific Slope bad a fair show it would be the
! busiest section of the United States," and in proof of
that assertion points to the fact that civilization has
â  turned its eyes at length to the world's greatest ocean,
â  destined to be the home of the world's greatest com
j merce. One factor of that boundless trade i- to be
' found among the teeming millions of Asia and an
; other in the vast resources and productiveness of
j California, Oregon and Washington
The Oregonian fears, however, that we are not
going to profit by the possibilities of that commerce
as we should. It points out that our Government has
done nothing to promote trade with the Orient,
while European nations have done much; and it ar
gues that Congress actually forbids trade between
the United States and Asia, saying: ''Trade on the
Pacific Slope is under the ban of Congress, put there
from studied purpose of a conspiracy on the Atlantic
seaboard. The parties to the conspiracy are threeâ
the sugar trust, the Canadian Pacific and New Eng
land traders."
With the statements of Our contemporary concern
ing the possibilities of , Oriental trade, and of. the
neglect of Congress to properly promote the interests
of the Pacific Coast, there is not likely to be much
disagreement. There is nothing in the" situation,
however, to justify a belief in the existence Of a con
spiracy in the East against our section of the Union.
The fact is, we arc ourselves to blame for Congres
sional neglect, for we have not sent from the Pacific
Coast to Washington a representation cquai to the
service required of it.
Rarely has any member of Congress from this coast
held office long enough to make himself an influential
factor in legislation. While the Eastern States send
to Washington the same men year after year, and
thus have the service of experienced statesmen to look
after their interests at the national capital, the custom
on this coast has been to send new men with each
succeeding election. The result has been that while
the East obtains about all it asks for, -we receive so
little attention that the Oregonian is half justified in
saying the Pacific Coast is the football of Congress.
The voters of the Fifth California District have
been wiser than those of other sections of the Pacific
Coast, and as a result their representative, Mr. Loud,
is one of the foremost among the younger leaders in
Congress. He holds important positions and is able
to render valuable service to his district and his State.
If his colleagues from other districts in this State and
from Washington and Oregon were equally experi
enced and influential much would be accomplished.
It is not worth while to accuse the Eastern people
of conspiracy. They have been looking after their
own interests, as they should, and it is for.us to look
after ours.
Since the British are of the opinion that the Ger
mans arc the cause of all the disturbance in Samoa,
and the Germans are equally certain the British are
the offenders, an opportunity is afforded our diplo
macy to persuade both of the contending parties' to
get out and leave the islands in our hands until the
dispute is amicably settled. .'

THE MINE LOCATION MESS.
BOOM IN GOLD DREDGING.
The miners of California are all at sea
concerning the law governing locations
since the Legislature adjourned. A flood
of questions comes to every possible
senior of information, and prospectors
are everywhere wondering what they
must do now. There has yet been given
no clear exposition of the situation, and
many mining attorneys have not yet
read the legislative act, and hence are
not ready to express definite opinions.
In a general way the situation is simply
this: The Legislature repealed.tbe State
law of 1897 and accomplished nothing else.
There is now nothing in the California
statutes governing mining cations in
any way. Th.re never was any State
law governing mining locations until the
Soward act of 1897 was passed, requiring
two notices of location of prescribed
nature, the abolishing of mining district
recorders, the filing of location notices
with the County Recorder only, and the
doing of $50 worth of work within sixty
days after location. upon lode claims and
$10 worth on placer claims. The Federal
law governing mining locations is a sim
ple one of rather skeleton form and per
mits and contemplates supplementary
State and, -district legislation. The
Soward law was the first of such sup
plementary, legislation by this State,. and
the miners did not like it. At the recent
session of the Legislature two bills pass.B
both houses. One simply repealed the
law of 1897 and the other enacted simpler
requirements as- to mining locations, pre
scribing but one notice, but retaining
the requirements 'of assessment work
within sixty days and the filing with the
County Recorder. The Governor signed
the repealing act. but not the other. one.
Hence, thanks to Mr. Gage, the State has
no location law and the Federal law oily
governs. The miners are thus left simply
where they were, before 1897. The repeal
ing act went into effect April 1.
The situation is thus simple on the face
of it, but the transition backward brings
its troubles to the mining mind. .For
instance, May mining districts be now
at once organized again and notices tiled
with its recorder? Would either the pre
liminary or second notice used during the
past two years be good for use now, or
must the oiu forms be obtained? hat
must be done by a man who located a
claim a day or a month before the repeal
of the State law, but who had not yet
done his $50 worth of assessment work?
In other words, Does the repealed law
govern locations begun under It? Such
questions as these will arise among min
ers ami preserve an open season for
aoubts for me time.
The opinions of A. H. Kick, us, the
well-Known authority on mining last and
author of the mining law ot Nevada,
will be of Interest concerning these
points. Concerning the situation ne says:
'â¢The eftect oi tne repeal oi tne null
ing act of Us 97 by the last Legislature of
this State is to legate the acquisition
and maintaining of tine to mining claims
to the provisions of tne Federal mining
law ana the local rules, regulation ana
customs ol miners, and if tnere are none
of the latter wholly to the United States
law. ,
"It is not necessary for the validity of
a mining location within tne State of
California' that the same snail be situ
ated within any organized uistrict, but
the miners have now the unrestricted
right to torm mining districts and tormu
late such rules ana regulations as tnc-y
may see proper, widen are not incon
sistent with the paramount or Federal
mining lawâ that is to say, they may now
prescribe the boundaries of the district
and the manner of locating a mining
claim, whether the same be a lode or a
placer claim, and tile- place, manner and
time of recording location notices and the
contents of the same, provided that each
record contains such a description of the
claim by reference to some natural ob
ject or permanent monument as will read
ily identify the claim.
"The miners ot tne district may now
provide for the election* of a r-Â .-. '
trict recorder, the posting and filing of
notices of location,' uno. -..at. __â¢_.. _ ,
regulations or -stoma tne notices 01 lo
cation Will be prima fa. I evidence of
the facts recited therein in any court in
this State. Miners may still record their
notices with the County Recorder, but
unless the district rules so provide such
notices will not be admissible in evi
dence. Â,,_.,
"in order to make a valid location in
the State of California under the laws
now exist;: therein, and in the absence
of any local rules, regulations and cus
toms, it is sufficient to make a discover;
of the lode, post upon the ground a no
tice of location containing the name of
the locator, the date of the location, the
name of the claim and such a descrip
tion of the- claim located by reference to
some natural object or permanent monu
ment as will identify the claim and by
placing a monument, which generally
consists of a stake set in a mound of
stones at each corner of the four corners
of the claim and a similar monument at
the center end of the location, and, for
safety, to record the same in the office of
the County Recorder of the county in
which the claim Is situated. And upon
any claim located sine., the repeal of
the act of 1897 no work need be clone on
any location until during the second cal
endar year of the location.
"Since the repeal of the act of 1897 It
is not necessary to complete the location
by doing the amount of work within the
sixty days required under that act nor
the filing of the final or completed no
ticeâthat is, the second notice of loca
tion therein provided for. The State law
wholly ceases to operate on the claim.
The law of 1897 did not abolish mining
districts, but it made the office of district
recorder useless by taking away the legal
ity of district records and making the
county seat the only place for a valid rec
ord. The practical effect was to generally
disorganize mining districts. Prospectors
grumbled much at the inconvenience.
Now there will be a general reorganiza
tion of mining districts throughout the
State and location notices will be again
filed with district recorders. The State
law, with its detailed requirements, left
mining districts little latitude for legis
lation, but now they are again the dole
sources of supplementary regulations.
When the law went Into effect district
records were gathered, often with much
trouble, by the County Recorders. In Mr.
Ricketts' opinion such old district re-cords
must remain where they are.
Prospectors will throw up their hats
chiefly at the escape from the assessment
work required within sixty days. Some
such requirement is badly needed when a
man may, locate forty claims and hold
them for nearly two years without doing
a stroke of work on them, and then relo
cate them, if quick enough, and hold
them for another two years.' The effect
of the State law was to vastly lessen. the
number of locations made, as a prospector
could hold only as many claims as he
could put $50 worth of work on in two
months. - Now one may locate as many
claims as lie pleases, and he not only has
until December 31, 1900, to do his $100 worth
of work but any work done this year will
not count on his assessment.- with the
present boom ,In prospecting mineral â¢ re
gions will be staked out in h lively way
from now on. And. according to Mr.
Ricketts, one who located a claim lust be
fore the repeal of the law may drop his
pick and not complete the $30 assessment
work that may be worrying htm. . '
As to tin- use of location notices, printed
according to the State law, they, would be
valid enough, but they are cumbersome
and complicated, and one of the old forms
would be better. . Â
RAPID RISE OF GOLD DREDGING IN
CALIFORNIA. ;
The starting of three hew. gold dredger
calls attention to the fact that dredging:
tor gold is just coming , ( to the front in
California. Wide. interest is being awak
ened in this interesting form of gold min
ing, which surely has a great future in
this State. Within two years some hun
dreds of thousands of dollars have been
invested in this field, which Is rapidly as
suming large importance.
There are now about ten dredgers of all
kinds and sizes on the' Feather, Yuba
American, Trinity, Klamath and Upper
Sacramento rivers.' Two of the largest
and best will be ready for operation with
in a few days. There is no good reason
why there should not be hundreds of gold
dredges working in the State, and there
undoubtedly will be in a few â . ears in
volving investments of millions, giving
employment and trade to many and large
ly increasing the gold output.
There is probably no large gold region
In the world so inviting for this kind of
mining. The, , beds of the lower courses
of the tributaries of the Sacramento. and
of other streams are deep beds of aurifer
ous gravels which can seldom be worked.
Miles of such unworked river beds are as
rich here and there as any ground worked j
In early days. Since the beginning of
gold mining here such beds have been
worked in small areas by wing damming, I
a costly and risky operation which can ;
be conducted but a small part of the
season.- but which is often very profit
able. Bedrock, where the greatest riches
lie. is often buried many feet deep, in
places nearly a hundred feet and in
others but five or ten. One of the notable
mining enterprises of the State is the
turning of the Feather wholly out of its
bed. A successful gold dredge works
such river beds- to bedrock and gets a
considerable percentage of the gold lying
on the bedrock and in its shallow crevices
and can operate all the year. Many de
posits have been worked only to the
water line.
' But the greatest amount of gold-bear
ing gravel is in the benches flanking the j
streams and in old channels, bars and I
basins. There is an immense area of
such ground averaging moderate values
of a few i cents, a cubic yard through
many feet of depth and often rich near j
bedrock. The only economical method |
of working such ground has been the
hydraulic process, and as thousands of
acres of such ground lie where the
hydraulic process cannot be used, - the
gold still waits extraction. A properly
designed gold dredge will work such de
posits -at- a cost- of from 3 to 5 cents a
cubic yard, or as cheaply per yard as a
hydraulic, plant would. work ground. As ;
vast areas' of ground will average 10 to
20 cents or even more; the opportunities
are 'evident. ,â¢-.-â¢
â â¢'.'California, which has led the world in
quartz mining, is late in "getting around j
to this form of the mining industry. It
began in New -Zealand in the early days |
of mining there, has. reached its highest!
development there, and the world turns
to New Zealand to learn the business.
' There has been a steady evolution of .
the gold dredge since then until now it ,
is one of the chief features of the New- |
Zealand mining industry. On the Clutha |
River in the province of Otago on the!
southern island there are seventy-five
dredgers; and there are perhaps a hun- >
d red more elsewhere in New Zealand. j
In quite recent years the success at- :
tamed in New Zealand has attracted at- j
tention throughout the world, and New j
Zealand methods have been the subject
of much inquiry, report and discussion in
Australia; South Africa, Siberia, Canada, I
the United States and elsewhere. Dredges
are now being built or contemplated in |
every auriferous region of the world. ;
Gold dredging in California may be said
to have started about five years ago, when
the Diestlehorst Brothers of Redding
rigged up a primitive contrivance and
went to working the bed of Lower Middle
Creek above Redding. It was a peculiar j
shaped scoop, holding one-third of a cubic
yard: and operated on a pontoon by a j
steam winch at one end, which dragged i
the scoop along the bottom quite like the
first New Zealand plant. But it paid, and
the- Diestlehorsts planned a larger steam j
power scoop dredge of another style- and j
built it on the Klamath. Then they built
another; and the two Diestlehorst dredges
are now operating at Big Oak Bar on the J
Klamath. A similar dredge of compara
tively small size was put to work on the
Upper Sacramento two or three years ago
by others, and then somebody installed on
that stream a dredge of the clam shell
type. No definite information as to cost
cf operation or profits of any of these
dredges has been given, but they work on
and evidently pay.
Three years ago R. H. Postlewalte came
here on" a business trip from New Zea
land, where he had for some years been
building modern dredges on the Clutha,
and seeing the great possibilities of the
business in California he went into it here
and built a dredge on the Yuba River,
which began operating eighteen months
ago. This was the first here of the type
used In New Zealandâ the continuous or
chain bucket* type, in which an endless
chain of buckets is directed against a bed
or hank. The scoop and clam shell dredges
have paid under favorable conditions, the
suction dredge, so efficient for some pur
poses, has always failed in this field, and
the New Zealand type has generally been
adopted,, though the first cost is larger.
When the Postlewalte dredge was In
stalled several large dredging plants had
; been put into successful operation at va
rious places along the Missouri, Inn Mo
ntana, in Colorado and elsewhere through
the western region, where they are now
rapidly multiplying and interesting capi
tal. Â:-,â¢.;-- 5^.,.; y : :.-, :
The success of the Postlewalte dredge
on the Yuba has been followed by the
building of five more, making six great
dredges of the modern type. One is on
the Trinity, one on the American, one on
tin- Yuba and three are on the Feather
low Oroville a few miles. These dredges
are all similar. There are two pontoons
about 100 feet long connected so as to
practieallv form one boat of that length.
23 feet wide, with a well hole five feet
wide and 75 feet long, through which is
operated the ladder or girder, up and
down which the chain of buckets travels.
This girder will, with its buckets, reach
ground 45 feet below water or quite a dis
tance above. Thirty-eight heavy, steel
lipped buckets or scoops travel at the rate
of fifteen per minute, driven by a 45-horse
power engine. These SCOOps will pick up
boulders of a ton weight, will dig into
hard ground and will scrape and dig up
the top of the bedrock. At the top the
buckets empty their material, which goes
into a big revolving screen or grizzly sup
plied with 3000 gallons of water per min
ute. The fine material is washed through
the screen and passes to plates and to
sluices fitted with cocoa matting and rif
fles, where 98 per cent of the gold is said
to be saved. The tailings and the boulders
from the grizzly go to an endless carrier,
which reaches out behind and which will
stack the debris 26 feet high. The ma
chinery is massive to stand the shocks
and wear. One of these dredges is quite
a complicated and striking affair. Each
has a dynamo driven by a separate en
gine for electric lights, and a five-barrel
steam winch for the cables which radiate
from the- corners and straight ahead to
hold the dredge in place and to move it.
Such a dredge costs $35,000. and In favor
able ground will handle 2500 cubic yards
per twenty-four hours. In Montana and
Colorado such dredging plants have in
cases been put on wheels running on a
track, but wherever water can be had
floating is preferred. These dredges are
operated twenty-four hours a day by
three shifts of only two men each. The
only other necessary employes are one
dredge master and a general superintend
ent.
Some of these dredges have been
"launched" like any boat, but others have
not. The one on the Trinity was built
nine months ago, and is owned by
Messrs. Oilman and McNeill of Chicago
who bought nearly four I miles of placer
ground about Lowden's" ranch, ten miles
above "Wcavervllle. The 1 dredger was put
up in an excavation nearly a mile from
the river, on an old bar, and a "sluice was
started un stream 'to supply water to
float . and- -operate the dredge. The
dredge floated off and went to work at the
gravel about It. There Is a great area
of pay gravel twenty-five to thirty feet
deep, enough to keep several â¢ dredgers
busy many years.

Through some one's blundering three
thousand sacks of grain were lost in the
Sacramento River last Saturday night.
The steamer Ban Jose was on her way
here with a barge in tow. On the barge
were four thousand sacks of wheat for
the British ship Primrose Hill. Just how-
It happened no one seems to know, but the
barge tilted over during the night and
nearly all the cargo went Into the river.
Some of it was recovered and put aboard
the San Jose and that vessel came on to
San Francisco, leaving the barge half un
der water and tied up to the bank.
During the run down the river the
wheat on the San Jose began to swell and
the bags burst. The grain ran all over
the decks, and when the steamer reached
the seawall it had to l- shoveled ashore.
The portion saved is now only fit for
chicken feed, so the entire barge load of
4000 sacks is practically a total loss.
There ara now forty-three foreign and
Atlantic vessels ln port, and of these one
8 loading wheat and four only are bound
for Europe. The Halewood came here
from Pisagua with a load of nitre, and she
Is going in ballast to ipilla to load
the same kind of a cargo for England.
The Primrose Hill will take wheat for
"stiffening" and general merchandise to
Liverpool: the Routenburn is at Eppin
ger's loading wheat for England, and the
Strathdon. as soon as she- discharges her
load of coal into the United States trans
port Arizona, will load redwood for Cork.
Of the others the Bldston Hill is under
charter to take 9. load of supplies for the
United States Government to Manila, the
Cardigan Castle takes supplies to Samoa
for the United States coaling station at
Pago Pago, the M. P. Grace goes to Port
Blakelev to load lumber for South Africa
and the' Prussia and Sonoma go into the
coasting coal trade. The disengaged ton
nage In port on Saturday was 31,006, while
at the same time last year it was only
psfirt. The engaged tonnage amounted to
24.373 tons, while last year it was 39,277.
Of the engaged fleet seven vessels are on
the berth for Hawaiian ports, two for
Siberian ports and two for Mexico. The
ship Columbia and the schooner Nokomls
are also loading for Siberia, but as they
belong to the coasting fleet they do not
appear in the above figures.
Tom Casey, the popular wharfinger at
Steuart street wharf, went on a fishing
expedition yesterday. In his young days
"Tom was a noted fisherman, and many
a yarn he spins of the "fish that got
away." in the chief wharfinger's office.
He was determined to make a good show
ing on this occasion in order to keep up
his reputation, so he took a can of giant
powder along.
The United States collier Brutus finished
taking aboard her cargo yesterday and
will sail for Guam at 10 a. m. to-day. The

Point drydock to-day. and to-morrow she
will go alongside Folsom street wharf,
â¢where the Alaska Iters' Association
has made room for her. The transport
Arizona finished coaling from the British
ship Strathdon yesterday and will begin
receiving supplies to-day. The Newport

day md to-morrow she will begin loading
at" the Mail Company's wharf. The
troops for Manila are now on their way
here, and as soon as they arrive the
transports will be ready to receive them.
Before next Monday the chances are that
all three vessels will l.Â» on their way.
The Toyo Risen Kaisha's steamer Nip
pon Maru will sail for the Orient next
Wednesday, loaded down to the guards
with freight. Every berth has been taken,
r.nd in order to get a passage many peo
ple will sleep on cots. Purser W. H. Ma
gee will not go out on the vessel, his place
being taken by H. Priver, one of the O.

remains asno,re. and Dr. Deas of the Har-
Ibor Receiving Hospital will go out in Dr.
Fine's place. The change of doctors will
be only temporary; that of purser and
freight clerk will be permanent.

SUICIDE OF HENRY ROTHSCHILD
Despondency Brought About by a
Falling Off in His Saloon
Business.
Henry RothschHd, who had conducted a
saloon at the northwest corner of O'Far
rell and Powell streets for a number of
years, died at his home, 815 Polk streef,
yesterday morning at 4:30 o'clock from
strychnine poisoning. The only reason
assignable for Rothschild's death Is that
he became despondent over his business,
which had been falling away during the
past year. Previous to his going Into the
saloon business he conducted a grocery
store it the place for a number of years,
but the section having lost its family
character for that of a choice tenderloin,
â wide open, sporty nature he sought bar
room business exclusively and failed. The
adverse change preyed on his mind and
caused him to take his life 1% the manner
described. ' ... .-;
Friday night Rothschild closed up his sa
loon as usual about 3 o'clock and went to
his home. The same morning when called
for breakfast by his wife he complained
of feeling sick ahd remained at the house
during the day. He was attended by Dr.
Frederick T. Bond, but nothing could be
done to save his life. His -widow and
daughter had attributed his death to an
accident caused by his drinking whisky
out of a bottle that had contained rough
on rats and which had not been cleaned
since the deadly mixture had been in It.
Coroner Hill, however. ignores the acci
dental cause and is pronounced In his
opinion that Rothschild commit!- suicide
with deliberate intent. Out of a feeling
of kindness for the family Dr. Hill per
mitted the body to remain at the resi
dence, whÂ«Â»re an autopsy will be held to
day. The deceased leaves a widow and
four young children to mourn over his sad
death.

HE BUILT A HORSELESS
CARRIAGE OF HIS OWN
A MONTH ago there Issued
from the basement of the
residence of J. A. Meyer, 1415
Twenty-fourth street, a
horseless carriage that Is
now the pride of Noe Val
ley. Ever since, on pleasant days, it
.__ been careering over the streets
if the city, distancing the speediest
roadsters and increasing the colony
of rubbernecks, for which this city is
justly famous. They cannot resist
the temptation to turn their heads
when Meyer's machine whizzes by.
The machine is entirely the product
of the brain and hands of Mr. Meyer.
He is foreman for the J. P. Hicks Gas
Engine Company, a designer and me
chanic of ability. Twelve years ago
while in the employ of Baker & Ham
ilton at Benicia, long before any one
else thought of such a thing, he was
seized with a desire to make ,a horse
less carriage. He went as far as con
structing the engine, when unexpected
difficulties arose, and he abandoned
the project, storing the engine In his
basement on Twenty-fourth street,
where it still stands. A sterling trib
ute was given to his skill in 1593. At
that time he exhibited at the Me
chanics' Fair a miniature Corliss en
gine, which "'was run during the expo
sition and for which he was given a
diploma of honor. ' ', '.-_-. ?
Meyer never abandoned the idea of
the horseless carriage, but did no
work upon It until two years ago,
when he happened to see running
through the park the vehicle' Imported
by Charles Fair. At that the ancient
fever seized him and he set to work,
the result being the perfect machine
that now carries himself, his wife and
children at a faster pace and in finer
style than any nabob In the city. At
the present time the machinery is per
MUSICAL SERVICES
AT EMMANUEL BAPTIST
HANDSOME NEW PIPE ORGAN
IS DEDICATED.
Rev. J. George Gibson, the Pastor,
Delivers an Eloquent Sermon
Before a Large Congre
gation.
The Emmanuel Baptist Church was
crowded last night by a congregation as
sembled to attend the dedication of the
handsome new pipe organ. The altar and
the , aisle approaches were handsomely
decorated with flowers. The new organ Is
built on the left of the chancel and well
situated with a view to the attainment' of
the best acoustic effects.
The services were musical in character.
The barytone solo, "Glory to Christ.. Our
King." was sung with deep emotion and
full solemnity. "The Lord of the Ages"
â¢was rendered by Mr. Russel Dowry with
great feeling. The last solo was a hymn
by Miss A. Lahl.
Rev. J. George Gibson, the pastor, de
livered the evening sermon, selecting for
his text "The Song of Moses and the
Lamb." He spoke of man's mission in life
and the fruits which come from a life of
Integrity, honor and truth.
The new organ has been raised by sub
scription and represents in a great meas
ure the unceasing labors of the pastor.

fect, working without -a hitch, but it
is not covered by the stylish box, a
four-seated phaeton affair, that
Meyer is . having built for It. As a
temporary affair he has a wagon
body made of redwood, which answers
all the purposes of exhibition.
As it stands, Meyer's horseless car
riage weighs SOO pounds, and at its
highest speed can be whisked over the
ground at the rate of eighteen miles
an hour. The motive power is fur
nished by a three and a half horse
power engine, weighing 200 pounds,
which is carried under the rear seat,
this is fed with naphtha gas, which It
aerates itself, and which is Ignited
In the explosion chamber 'if the cylin
der by a spark produced by an eight-
.-11 dry battery. The exhaust is taken
up so perfectly in condensers under
the wagon body that there Is neither
noise nor smoke. The wheels have
solid cushion tires and roller bear
ings, assuring an easy, noiseless mo
tion, as was proved by a ride on the
carriage over none too smooth a
road. The combination brake and
steering gear and the water circula
tion in the engine are absolutely per
fect.
The naphtha tank will contain
enough of that fluid to generate gas
for a run of twelve hours, and enough
more can be carried in cans to triple
the running radius. Altogether, it
seems as perfect a machine as could
be turned out of any factory.

their unwillingness to believe that "one
whom they had put to death' as. a male
factor was the 'first fruits of them that
Bleep.' The Sadducees rejected it as an
Impossibility. "As Holy Scripture says,
they believed neither in Resurrection { nor
spirit nor angel. - r "
"When also St. Paul preached the doc
trine at Athens, some of the Greeks
mocked; others said, 'We will hear you
again about this matter.' 'There were
even doubts and difficulties among pro
fessing Christians on this great . point,
which had to be cleared up by; St. Paul.
Perhaps no fact indicates more -clearly
the almost universal disbelief in this doc
trine, among the civilized Romans . than
that cremation was a common method- of
disposing of the dead.. . Â_,'â¢'â¢
"The Christian doctrine of the - Resur
rection is essential to the belief in mans
immortality, because man is a composite
being, having both, soul and body. The
union of the soul and body In man is sub
stantial, hence if man Is. to live hereafter
in a perfect state his body after death
must be united to his soul." â¢'.;:;;
AT PARK AND BEACH.
Owing to the Cold Weather Crowds
Were Small.
It was cold and disagreeable at the park
and . beach yesterday, and hte small
crowds that ventured from their
homes to seek - pleasure- '. in the
open soon . returned to shelter. The
drive was small, as were, the number of
wheelmen. No accidents occurred to liven
matters up. so altogether it was a 'very
dull day.
Notwithstanding the ' cold ' weather an
average crowd visited the Chutes. A new
illusion and the London door maze- have
been added to the many attractions^ at
the grounds; and - were well - patronized
throughout the day. Many. people also
congregated at Sutro's' Baths to witness
the aquatic contests. Following are the
results: -â¢.-..--â¢.â >..
50-yard dash (novice), . H. - Irving- first
and A. McKenzle, second;, 50-yard flash

from the pressure of the water. I had
the worst kind of kidney trouble, faint-

and the doctor said there was a tumor
in my left side. The pains I had to
stand were something - v dreadful. â¢ 'A
friend handed me a little book of yours,
so I got your medicine and it has saved
my life. I felt better from the first
bottle. The bloating , : and the tumors
have all gone and I do not suffer any

Compound ' and hope others may find
relief as I have done from its use."â

OAKLAND TRIES
TO PLAY WITH A
CRIPPLED TEAM
Two Men Sent to the
Repair Shop.
A CHAPTER OF ACCIDENTS
HAMMOND AND DUNLEAVY ARE
BADLY INJURED.
Hardie Breaks All the Catchers'
Masks, Murphy Loses His Shoes
and San Jose Has an
Easy Time.
After sending two of his men off to the
hospital in an ambulance and digging
around among the bleachers for volun
teers to fill up the gap in his ranks. Man
ager Ewing yesterday watched his Oak
land misfits give way before the prune
pickers in .1 game replete with swats and
mispiays.
The slaughter occurred right at the out
set of the game, when his two catchers
were carried off the battlefield In rapid
succession. This so -heartened the
others, particularly Moskiman, that they
were unable to make any stand against
the giants from the prune belt. Moski
man. who is usually a mystery to oppos
ing batsmen, could do nothing better than
sail straight, juicy ones up the main
ais'.e, fifteen of which were dispatched to
portions of the field that were unpro
tected.
San Jose was first at bat and Hammond
donned the mask and air cushion for the â 
cripples. Hardly a half dozen balls had
been pitched before Hammond was caught
with a foul tip between the thumb and
forefinger of his right hand, splitting that
member down to the center of the palm.
He was sent to the Receiving Hospital
and Dunleavy called in from center field,
Shea, the change pitcher, who was play
ing on the bench, going into the field. San
Jose was retired without a run and Oak
land went to bat.
Dunleavy led off with a beautiful three
cushion shot, but had to slide into the bag
to beat the ball. He went # in feet first
and caught his foot in the strap, giving
his ankle a terrible wrench. He was as
sisted to the clubhouse and into his street
clothes, and as soon as his shoe was re
moved his ankle swelled to the size of his
calf. -
Game had to be called until Manager
Ewing could find somebody to fill out the
team. Finally Ford, who caught last
season for the Athletics, was drafted,
and while he was getting into a uniform,
"Clam Juice Lou" endeavored to adjust
himself to a mask, as it was the Intention
to have him go behind the bat. Hardies
head became so enlarged at the thought
of getting back Into his old-time posi
tion that he broke the straps to both of
the face-protectors, and there being no
birdcages In the neighborhood for him
to use- as a substitute, he was. perforce,
compelled to continue In the right
meadow, while Ford did the receiving.
This closed Oakland's chapter of ac
cidents with the exception of Murphy,
who forgot his Working shoes and was
obliged to play in his street footgear,
which destroyed his lack of confidence In
himself when he attempted to move
about. But the team had lost heart, and
that meant the game. Lange made two
costly errors, one of which, combined
with a bungle by Lee Hammond, re
sulted in six runs in the- fourth inning.
Klelber made some embalmed-beef
plays for San Jose, but Fatty will always
make- errors, for he never shirks any
thing that comes anywhere near him.
The triple that Dunleavy tore off in the
first netted a run for Oakland, which was
balanced In the second by San Jose.
Eagan getting a single and completing
the circuit on Mosklman's throw Into the
field to head off Andrews at first. They
got another in the third, two singled and
a long fly to Hardie letting Foley get
around.
The fourth Inning tore the life out of
the game. Klelber. the first man up, was
safe on Hammond's fumble. Eagan was
given a pass and Andrews hit to Mos
kiman. who threw to Lange to head off
Klelber. The ball struck Fred's hands
fairly and bounded out, Kleiber scoring
and Andrews reaching first, when a
double play was in order, which would
have retired the side. Andrews tried to
steal second, but was thrown out by
Ford, who duplicated the performance
twice afterward, to the intense disgust
of the blond twirler. Then came the
bombardment on Moskiman. Kent, Mc-
Gucken, Foley, Anderson and Hanlon
followed with singles, which with Dal
rymple'B long fly to Hardie scored five
more tallies, a total of six for the inning.
San Jose finished Its run-getting in the
fifth, scoring one run, although the first
four men up made nice, safe shots. Eagan
led off with a single, stole second and
scored on Andre drive. The pitcher
made another futile attempt to steal sec
ond, when if he had waited he could have
gone the rounds on Kent's and MeGucken's
safe shots. As it was, both of those men
were left on bases.
Oakland tallied again in that inning.
Murphy getting around on errors by
Klelber and Andrews and a single by
Hammond. Hits by Murphy. Lange and
Hammond gave them one more run in the
ninth, but It was of no importance as far
as the outcome was effected.
Ford has been signed to do the catching
for Oakland until W. Hammond gets back
into the game, and he may be retained
permanently, for Borland, who was signed
because of his batting powers, is not hit
ting at all this season. Manager Ewing
will also replace Murphy at first as soon
as lie can find a good baseman. Murphy
is a fine player and hard hitter, but he
Ib unable to get away from his business
to play during the week, and the team is
badly handicapped thereby.
The team is in a bad way just now, for
Donovan, who was compelled to retire
from Saturday's game, will - not be in
shape again for two or three weeks, and
with W. Hammond and Dunleavy laid up
it takes three of the best run-getters out
of the game. The score:

WATSONVILLE. April 9.-In the pres
ence of a large and enthusiastic audience
of baseball fans the Watsonville "Sugar
Beets" succumbed to Uncle Hank Harris'
Frisco lads to-day by a score of 3 to 1.
I: was one of the most interesting games
ever played here. The only two errors
were made by Catcher Morrow of the
Watsonvilles. Both were on throws to
second and were responsible for one run.
Both Iberg and Whalen were batted free
ly, but their excellent support saved them
from more base hits. Trie Watsonville
lads were very unsuccessful in landing
their hits in safe territory. The home
team redeemed themselves for the poor
playing done yesterday, which was due,
no doubt, to lack of harmony among the
players. The public was again disap
pointed to-day !n not seeing -a regular
league umpire present. Below is the score:

SACRAMENTO, April 9.â Fifteen hun
dred people saw the Statesmen defeat the
Santa Cruzans this afternoon by a score
of 6 to 4. The game was very fast from
the start, and interest never flagged. The
locals took three runs in the first and
three in the second inning, while the
Beachcombers crossed the plate three
times in the fourth and once in the sixth.
The feature of the game was Clark's long
drive over right field fence, a thing which

RUSTY GOLD RUNNER UP
METALLIC WAS THE GOOD THING
â¢ OF THE DAY.
Fleet Maid of the Hill Captured
the Extra Stake in
Very Easy Fash
ion.
* Gladiator added another stake to his
credit yesterday at the Union Coursing
Park, winning the open stake in masterly
fashion. The dog is 'the property of
James Dean, and in all his courses he
showed both the speed and condition over
his company. The runner-up was Royal
Flush, who ran in remarkably fine form.
Emm Pasha was the surprise of the day.
making a grand showing, and was not put
out until the sixth round by the runner
up. 'i>.vC-;-\: c ;'
Never before In the history of the park
have the shortenders had such a success
ful day. In the third round of the open
stake six dogs on the short end secured
the winning flag in quick succession. The
first was Metallic, who defeated that good
hound Connnemara by a very flunky
course. The lead-up. was made by Conne
mara, but the hare swung round to Me
tallic and he made a drive and kill. Jen
nie Wilson was next on the list, defeating
Firm Friend. Emm Pasha was right in
line with the procession, being slipped to a
hare with False Flatterer. The black and
white dog ran like a demon, and after a
few turns killed, with the Flatterer point
less. Emm Pasha's price was the longest
of the day, pools being sold on him as
good as 4 to 1. Glen Roy and Koolawn
were the other good things in this round.
i Ida ran abominably, and is either a
"lurcher" or in bad condition. She ran
with Shylock Boy and was unable to get
up the least resemblance of a run.
The "extra" stake was won by the Maid
of the Hill. A few of the wise ones touted
Black Night as a good thing, but the best
she could do was to get second money.
Mission Tip was the only shortender that
won in the stake, defeating Winning
Ways at 2% to 1.

Los Angeles Coursing.
LOS ANGELES. April 9.â The somewhat
chilly weather to-day had the effect of
diminishing the attendance at the
coursing at Agricultural Park, espe
cially in the grand stand, though there
were at least 2500 people on the grounds
and the sport was good.
The programme comprised two stakes â
a 16-dog sapling and a 32-dog openstake.
The sapling stake was the first ever run
in Southern California, and another sap
ling of twenty-four dogs Is announced for
next Sunday to accommodate the first
crop of puppies that have come into the
running since coursing was -inaugurated
here.' For the saplings First Call took
first money,' with Ida May second and
Me's Rosebud third.
In the open stake Lass O'Gowne took
first money, with Master Jack second and
Mountain Belle third. There were several
surprises, the most noticeable of which
was when Lass O'Gowne put out the
crackajack Merry Maiden in the first ties.
The dogs as a rule ran true to form,
though all bets were declared off in the
decision.
WANT TO RESUME.
Ingleside Coursing Club Would Like
to Open When the Races Close.
The Ingleside Coursing Club, which sus
pended operations at its grounds at In
gleside as soon as the ordinance passed
by the Supervisors stopping betting both
on horse races and coursing, expects to
resume operations at its grounds as soon
as the racing season is over in May. The
offici of the club seriously contemplat
ed building a coursing park outside the
county line, but no suitable site could be
selected. The most available quarters
that the club members wanted was a
strip of land near the lakes of the Spring
Valley Water Company, beyond the coun
ty line, but after a great amount of work
and time had been spent in making pre
liminary steps to rent the land they dis
covered they could not lease the prop
erty for any length of time. What steps
the Police Department will take in the
matter when the club resumes operations
remains to be proved, but the general
belief among the sporting fraternity 01
the city is thai the club is bluffing, and
that betting on coursing will not be
countenanced IU the city, whether horse
racing is running or not.

DELIBERATELY INSULT
MEXICO'S EMBASSADOR
WASHINGTON, April 9.â lt is painfully
apparent European Embassadors here
have determined to boycott their new
colleague, Mr. Aspiroz of Mexico. There
have been suspicious circumstances from
the hour of his arrival, but the officials of
our Government and Washington society
generally have been reluctant to believe
such eminent and broad minded states
men as Sir Julian Paunceforte, Count Cas
sill, Dr. yon Holleben, Jules Cambon and
others would deliberately humiliate a
stranger, and one so amiable and honor
able as the Embassador from Mexico.
They no longer conceal their inten
tions, and Count; Lichdervelde, the Bel
gian Minister, who telegraphed to Brus
sels for instructions as to the course he
should pursue, has been directed by his
Government to stand by the representa
tives of European powers and freeze the
Mexican out. -
They did not call upon him before his
presentation. When he called . upon
them they were met at home, and none
of them appeared at his reception.
This might have been due to a series of
accidents, but it was no accident that
every member of the diplomatic corps
sent regrets to the reception which ex-
Secretary and Mrs. John W. Foyer gave
in honor of Mr. and Mrs. Aspiroz last
Wednesday evening, which was not only a
slight to the guests of that evening but
to the hosts also.
Yesterday afternoon at a tea given by
Countess Lichderveld, wife of the Bel
gian Minister, the truth came out. The
Mexican Embassador and Mrs. Aspiroz
were the only members of the diplomatic
corps who were not present, and their
absence was due to a failure to reveice
invitations. It was a deliberate insult.
The pretext for the boycott lies in the
historical fact' that thirty years ago Mr
Aspiroz happened to be the Judge Advo
cate. General of the Mexican Army, who
was detained by President Juarez" to try-
Pretender Maximilian, the Austrian arch
duke, who, under protection of Louis
Napoleon of France, claimed the throne
of Mexico. But why the performance of
a military duty under orders from his
Government by- Mr. Aspiroz a third of a
century ago should make _lm an unlit
associate of the British, German. French
Russian and Italian embassadors is diffi
cult to understand.
Great Britain and Germany refused to
sustain Maximilian and practically re I
pudiated the Invasion of Mexico and it
is not believed either of these govern
ments-will approve the action of its Em
bassador in declaring a boycott against
his colleague upon such; a pretext if they
are appealed to.

board.
Amid scenes of revelry and mirth, occa
sionally interrupted by a fight, which re
sulted in no serious damage to the con
testants, the picnic resort at El Campo
was thrown open to the public yester
day. Several hundred people attended the
opening, evidently bent on having a good
time.
The superintendent of the grounds, an
ticipating a large crowd of picnickers,
made every arrangement for their com
fort. A band of fourteen pieces was in at
tendance, and at the conclusion of the
day's festivities the wind jammers were
in a condition bordering on apoplexy.
Immediately after the arrival of the 2
o'clock boat, which carried a large crowd
to the picnic grounds, the fun began.
A young man who was known to his as
sociates as "Teddy," evidently jealous of
a south of Market dude who was dancing
with his best girl, swore to be revenged.
Summoning another youth, who was
staggering under a load of bad beer,
"Teddy" confided to him his intention of
sending the dude to the Morgue.
"It's this way," angrily declared the
jealous suitor, -'me and Nell have been
friends for years, and I'm dead stuck on
her. See! Now, this mug shows up and
cops her out. 1 s'pose I'm a dead one
wid her. but I want ter get even; are
you on?"
"You want me to soak him, eh?" in
quired the other youth, evidently anxious
for a scrap.
"Oh, get next," angrily retorted the
pugnacious suitor.
"I'll do the punching and you keep
Nell from getting mixed up in the finish.
See! She's a dead game sport and if she
gets next that I'm going to do the guy
she will interfere. l want ter do him
good so that she will be ashamed to speak
to him. Are you wise?"
Of course his friend was wise, and
after awaiting a favorable opportunity,
just when the much admired ".sell" was
engaged in devouring a ham-and-egg
sandwich, the love-stricken youth walked
up to his rival and struck him in the
jaw. knocking him out. While waiting
for him to regain his feet "Nell," who
had witnessed the knockout of her new
admirer from a distance, rushed to the
scene and struck "Teddy" in the face
with the remnants of her ham-and-egg
sandwich. .... .. â
With his face besmeared with the fried
egg the belligerent youth turned to his
fair assailant and pleaded with her to
forgive him. . . I Â'
"It's all your fault," he tearfully re
marked, "yer know I'm stuck on yer, and
ver give me the worst of it. This dude is
not fit for you, as he can't fight enough
to keep hlsself warm."
After casting a scornful glance at the
prostrate dude, "Nell," evidently touched
by the remarks of her old suitor, threw
her arms around his neck and in burning
words declared her love for him. A few
minutes later the reunited couple were
lost in the mazes of a waltz, while the
bruised dude was busily engaged in
searching for a policeman to have his
assailant arrested.
On the return trip to the city there were
several "scraps," which were quickly
stopped -by the police.
A red-headed urchin almost created a
riot by attempting to sing "How I Love to
See My Poor Old Mother Work." He was
promptly seized by several young men,
who started to drag him to the railing
of the steamer, intending to throw him
overboard. Two policemen, realizing the
boy's danger, rushed to his assistance,
and after considerable trouble succeeded
ln saving him from being thrown into the
water. â

SHELL MOUND SHOOTING.
Targets Were Well Patronized by-
Skillful Marksmen.
A large number of skillful marksmen
gathered Shell Mound yesterday and
kept up a constant fusillade at the â¢
targets. The day was not a good one
from a rifleman's point of view on ac
count of the shifting light and a strong
wind. Nevertheless the shooting con
tingent adjusted their rifles and them
selves to the somewhat unfavorable con

very good scores.

Canoe Beat the Fleet in Oakland
Navy Race Yesterday.
The fourth Oakland navy race of the
season of 1899 was held yesterday on San
Antonio Estuary over the regular tri
aneular course of about six miles on an
ebb tide, with a fresh westerly breeze. At
the same time and over the same course
the 'Oakland Canoe Club held a mixed
race for sloops and canoes. The start was
by a single gun, and was maoe at 12:51
m. While maneuvering about before
the start the canoe Codia capsized near
the float of the Alameda Boat Club.
. She was bailed out, and started round

OF GEN. LUDLOW
Lanuza Refuses to Grant
Ortiz's Request.
THAT INCOMMUNICADO LAW
MILITARY GOVERNOR INTER
FERED FOR AMERICANS.
Cuban Generals Have Not Yet Noti
fied Gomez of His Re-Election as
Commander-in-Chief of the
Insurgent Army.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
HAVANA, April 9.â Secretary of Jus
tice Lanuza will probably riot comply
with the request of Judge Ortiz of the
Guadaloupe District Court, Havana
Province, to prosecute General Ludlow,
the military Governor, . or "interfering:
to prevent Dr. Jolliffe and Mr. Barton,
Americans, being kept incommunicado,
as provided by the Spanish law."
If the matter is brought to an issue
the question will be whether an Amer
ican official has a right to issue an or
der contravening a Spanish law unless
supported by decree of the Governor
General. Judge Ortiz insists that the
incommunicado law is in full force, like
all other Spanish laws which General
Brooke's proclamation of January 1
affirmed were to be unchanged. Mr.
Ludlow intervened in the case of Jol
liffe and Barton because the Spanish
officials refused to allow the attorneys
and friends of the prisoners to have ac
cess to them. It was this condition of
things, that prompted his written in
structions to Judge Ortiz not to apply
the incommunicado rule to Americans.
All railway communication from Ha
vana eastward is suspended because
the strike of 200 employes of the united
railways affects the provinces of Ma
tanzas and Santa Clara, as well as the
routes to Guanajay, province of Pinar
del Bio, and to Batanbano, where the
steamships make their communication
with Havana. No freight or passengers
could be moved to-day. The inconveni
ence resulting is very great. It is hoped,
however, that the strike will be settled
amicably.
To-day the Cuban generals who yes
terday elected General Gomez com
mander-in-chief were to notify him
officially of their action. They had not
done so up to 7 o'clock this evening, but
it is reported that he is to be waited
upon by a committee during the course
of the evening. There are so many
contradictory reports as to their inten
tions and doings that the fact of their
accomplishing little or nothing is be
ginning to discredit in advance what
ever action they may ultimately take,
which, at the best, will be merely con
ferring an honorary distinction, as Gen
eral Brooke is preparing to handle the
payment of the Cuban army quite in
dependently of General Gomez.
A soldier at Matanzas yesterday, one
of a squad cleaning the courtyard of
the castle, found a Spanish gold piece.
The members of the squad immediately
staked off claims in Western style and
dug up the whole yard, finding coins
dated all the way from 1730 to 1808 and
worth 306 American dollars.
Sport in. the Handball Arena.
Every available inch of sitting and

made to hop at a lively gait until the

ENDS IN FAILURE
Nevada County Officials
Discouraged.
SEARCHING POSSES RETURN
WILL REST UNTIL A TANGIBLE
CLEW IS RECEIVED.
Believe the Fugitive Murderer Either
Has Got Out of the County
or Is Sheltered by a
Friend.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEVADA CITY, April 9.â The murder
of Policeman Kilroy is still unavenged
and his slayer, Ed Moore, yet at lib
erty. The hunt for Moore in this vicinity
is practically at an end and the au
thorities have come to the conclusion
that their only chance to capture him
is to rest â¢-ii their arms until some .re
liable clew to his whereabouts devel
ops. If Moore is still hiding within the
boundaries of the count; the authori
ties feel hat by this time he will have
decided to emerge from his hiding place
and make a break for the lowlands and
liberty.
The weather looks threatening to
night, and should it become stormy it
is believed Moore will be forced to make
his way to a point where he will be pro
tected from the fury of the elements.
Once on the march Moore will have lit
tle chance to elude the officers. Photo
graphs and descriptions of the man
have been posted conspicuously in
every town and hamlet in this and ad
joining counties, and if Moore has not
already passed out of the county his
chances for doing so now are small.
Sheriff Getchell arrived at Chico last
night and immediately joined the posse
which has been searching for a trace
of the man answering Moore's .crip
tion who was seen in that vicinity
shortly before noon yesterday. Up to
a late hour last night no word was re
ceived from Sheritt Getchell as to the
failure or success of the pursuit. The
prevailing impression here is that the
Chico scent will lead the posse on the
heels of a harmless "Weary Willie," of
which species there are many traveling
at this time of the year.
With the passing days wanes the
citizens' iiope c-f avenging the death of
Kilroy. Moore has evaded pursuit so
long that the excitement has begun to
subside and it is doubtful now it Moore
would' be violently dealt with in the
event of his ing brought in alive.
There is, however, one disadvantage
under wnich the murderer would De
placed in connection with the possibil
ity of being lynched. There is a grow
ing feeling here that if taken alive and
given a trial Moore would plead in
sanity, and it is Just possible one man
in a jury of twelve would consider the
plea. Moo-re has the reputation of be
ing a peculiar man, and if life depended
upon it liis attorneys might attempt
to blossom his peculiarities into a case
of insanity in order to save him from
paying the penality for his crime. To
prevent the success of such a plan the
citizens might take the law into their
own hands. â¢
There are only two theories now as
to Moore's whereabouts which are be
ing seriously considered by the citizens
and authorities and they narrow down
to deiinite propositions: The fugitive
has cither succeeded In getting out of
the county or he has a friend some
where in the mountains close to the
scene of his rime who has supplied
him with food and shelter since the
night of his flight. When Moore' first
took to the woods general speculation
was overwhelmingly in favor of the
theory advanced by the searching
posses and others who knew Moore's
habits that Moore was hiding or being
sheltered by a friend somewhere in thi:,
vicinity. Now there la a growing senti
ment that the fugitive has succeeded
In placing many miles between himself
and the citizens of this county. Still,
scarcely anybody doubts that Moore
easily could have remained all this time
in the seclusion of the neighboring
woods and mountains if he had a faith
ful friend to supply him with provis
ions. The possibility of his evading
justice and remaining in this vicinity
without a friend is now considered quite
remote. Nine â  lays have passed since
Mo-ore murdered Policeman Kilroy, and
it is hardly possible that he could re
main in hiding in this vicinity so long
without having received aid of some
isort From a friend.
It is now generally believed that the
$1000 reward offered for Moore, dead or
alive will be the only successful fac
tor in bringing about his arrest or
death.

BRYAN CONTINUES HIS
DEBATE WITH BELMONT
Insists That True Democracy Is Em
bodied in the Chicago
Platform.
LINCOLN. Nebr., April 9.â Colonel W.
J. Bryan to-day mailed his answer to the
last letter received from Perry Belmont
some weeks ago. The correspondence thus
far has dealt largely with the rival Jef
ferson dinners to be held in New York,
but Mr. Bryan ignores that matter and
devotes his attention to the differences
existing between himself and Mr. Bel
mont on the question of Democratic party
policy. His letter in part follows:
You ask. first, that I point out wherein your
utterances. are "unpatriotic, undemocratic un-
American anil ln conflict with the Democratic
creed as set forth in Jefferson's first inaugural
address."
We have no accepted standard by which to
determine whether a given opinion is patriotic
or American, but we have means of determin
ing whether an opinion is democratic and in
accord with the teachings of Jefferson. 1 pre
sume you use the word "Democratic" in the
party sense, Otherwise that term would be as
difficult to define as "patriotic" or "Ameri
can."
The right to determine what Is democratic
in a party sense belongs to the Democratic
party. The Chicago convention was more pure
ly representative than any other convention
held ln recent years, because the rank and file
of the party spoke on public questions through
Instructed delegates. The Chicago platform is
the latest authoritative definition of democracy
as applieM to existing conditions. If a minority
of the delegates to a national convention repre
senting a minority of the members of the
Democratic party has alright to determine what
is democratic, then each member of the party
has a right to define democracy for himself and
to assert that he is a better Democrat than
any one else.
Let me apply this principle to three question*
upon which you have taken a position in the
volumes sent me:
Firstâ Standard money.
Secondâ Paper money.
Thirdâ tax.
Jefferson favored the double standard as
against the single gold standard, and during
his administration our nation had the free and
unlimited coinage of gold and silver at the
legal ratio of 15 to 1. The ratio was changed
to 16 to 1- during Jackson's administration. The
Chicago platform pronounced against the .i.l
standard and In favor of the return to the free
and unlimited coinage of gold and silver at the
ratio of 16 to J without waiting for the aid or
consent of any other nation. As a delegate to
the Chicago convention you voted for a minor-
ity report which declared against independent
free coinage on the ground that It would not
only Imperil our finances, "but would retard or
entirely prevent International bimetallism, to
which the effort of the Government should be
steadily directed." As a de-legate to the In
dianapolis convention, two months later, you
supported a platform which declared in favor
of the gold standard without any declaration
in favor of international bimetallism. You may
be able- to explain why the minority rejected
I at the Indianapolis convention the plank for
which it fought at Chicago.
McKinley In IS9I charged in a public speech
that Mr. Cleveland during his first administra
tion was dishonoring one of the- precious
metals â discrediting sliver and enhancing the
price of gold. He insist. -d that Mr. -Cleveland
was trying to make "money -scarce ami there
fore dear," and added, "he would have In
creased the value of money and diminished the
value of everything- money the master
and everything else the servant." If Mi-Kin- -
ley then understood the real purpose of the
gold standard, as I believe he did. who could
think Jefferson capable of advocating a policy
which instead of securing equal and exact
justice for all. makes "money the master and
everything else the servant."
Your pronhecy that " a law to prevent wage
earners and salary earners from demanding
and urine payment in gold dollars .aid
not be a winning- Issue." evince? a tender so
licitude for the laboring man. I mlcht sug
pes* that bimetallism alarms you mere- than
It does the wage earners. It was not the em
ployes who Were frightened at the specter of
free silver in ISM: neither did the laboring man
Fhare your desire to add to the privileges of
the banks.
On December 20, IW, a year after the elec
tion, the Federation of Labor adopted the fol
lowing resolution-
"Resolved. That we declare ourselves most
pesititvely opposed to the Gape bill recently
introduced in Congress by the Secretary of the
Treasury. It is a measure that If made a law
â will only the more firmly rivet the gold stand
ard on the people of the country and perpetu
ate its disastrous effects in every form."
I' am not willing to believe that you are more
interested in the laboring men than they are in
themselves, or that you know better than they
what Is pood for them.
STERNWHEEL STEAMER
SINKS IN THE OHIO
Passengers and Crew of the John K.
Speed Rescued Without Loss
of Life.
LOUISVILLE, Ky., April 9.â The big
rnwheel steamer John K. Speed, owned
by the Cincinnati and New Orleans Packet
Company, became unmanageable this
afternoon, owing to a treacherous cur- j
rent and the high wind prevailing, and I
struck the dam. The vessel careened,
almost toppling over, but righted again
and soon settled down to rock bottom. ;
The water rushed into her hold through
a big jagged hole aft of her boilers. . A ;
16-Inch pine derrick pole supporting the ;
staging broke in two and the staging
went overboard with a crash. It was a
miracle that several of the crew were j
not killed or injured. As it was, not one i
cf the 109 aboard was hurt in the least.
Life savers responded with the greatest
alacrity with all their lifeboats and were
beside the vessel immediately. With two
crews ferrying from the boat to the
shore all the- passengers were soon
brought to terra lirroa and the members I
of the deck and cabin crew were car- ;
lied over. - ;
The Speed was on her way to New Or- â 
leans and carried 405 tons of miscellane- !
ous freight. It is thought that at least
three-fourths of the Speed's value will
be saved, while the actual loss on the'
cargo will not be over $1000. The Speed
was valued at about $25,000. She ties on
the- rocks with the water over her main j
deck amidships. j â .- '-

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, APRIL 10, 899;
TRADE WITH OUR
NEW POSSESSIONS
Increase in Exports and
Imports.
PHILIPPINES AS A MARKET
GROWTH OF SHIPMENTS FROM
THE UNITED STATES.
Considerable Gain Shown in the Traf
fic With Cuba, Though the Bal
ance Is Aj-iinst This
Country.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, April 9. â Acting
Secretary of "War Meiklejohn Rave out
for publication to-day some interesting
statistics regarding the trade of the
United States with i" - Is'ind of Cuba.
Porto Rico and the Philippines, pre
facing them by calling attention to the
fact that normal conditions of trade
have not yet been fully restored be
tween the islands named. The returns
(or February show an increase of im-
ports from the islands in this country
amounting to $374, and a correspond
ing increase of exports from the United
States to the islands of $693,269. as com
pared with the same month a year ago.
The trade of the United States with â 
the Philippines, it is said, begins to '
show the natural growth due to the di- |
rection of the attention of American !
exporters to the archipelago. While
the exports from our ports to the Phil- i
ippine Islands for February of last
year amounted to only $1907, for the ;
same months this year they are more
than ten times as much, being $19,525. j
For the eight months ended with Feb- |
ruary 2S, IS9S, they were only $69,235, j
while for the corresponding period of
the present fiscal year they show a sain
of nearly 70 per cent, reaching $117.- !
021. Our direct importations from
Manila for February were $277,033. a *
gain of nearly 50 per cent over the !
same month last year. Notwithstand
ing the decline of imports into the :
United States from the Philippines i
during the months of active warfare,
the imports for eight months preceding
March reached $2,641,175. as compared
with $2,102,889 for a Similar period the
â¢year before.
Our trade with Porto Rico likewise
shows an excess of imports over ex
ports to that island. For the eight
months of the fiscal year the Imports
from Porto Rico to the United States
gained $60,000 in value over the former
year, being $587. against $525.554. Of
this gain more than one-half was in the
month of February, when the imports
of 1899 reached $124,618. against $89,186
for IS9S.
The trade balance between this coun
try and Porto Rico is now in favor of
our exporters, as for the same month
the exports were $267,619, or $170,545 in
excess of those of 1898. For the eight
months of the fiscal year the exports
amounted to $1,326,596. a gain of $12.
--596, developed regardless of the several
months when the ports of the island
were closed to our wares and mer
chandise.
Trade with Cuba has been in the
past several times as large as our trade
with Porto Rico and the Philippines
combined, and now is already showing
wonderful gains over the older figures.
A year ago in February, before the
war, we imported from the Island of
Cuba goods valued at $2,059,729. while
for the same month of the current year
the. figures were $2,307,940. For the
period of July 1, IS9B, to February 2S.
1899, the total imports to United
States ports from Cuba were $9,178 778
against $6,413,028 for the like period a
year earlier. This increase of more
than two and three.-ouarter millions
mainly occurred during the last several
months, when the crops were being
shipped.
The exports to Cuba have also pros
pered, those of January and February
showing an increase of over a million
dollars in value. For February. 1898.
the merchandise exported from this
country to Cuba was valued at $1,166.
--744. while for the same four weeks of
1899 the figures were $1,671,846. The
aggregate worth of the exports from
the first of last July to the end of Feb
ruary is given at $1,142,949, an increase
of 33 per cent over the preceding year.

closet. He made a rope of two towels, one
end of which he tied to a gas pipe anil
the other to his neck. He was slowly

NOTHING NOW
HEARD OF THAT
SILVER GAVEL
Its Mission Ends When the City
Treasury Is Empty.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call, I
908 Broadway, April 9.
THE forced donation of one-quarter of [
their salaries by a small army of city
employes Is no more of a joke |
than it is an act of charity. Nor can ]
the victims be blamed for the references
they are making to the fact that while
the treasury' is empty the shores of Lake ;
Merritt are being filled. In a word, the j
employes of the city are working as hard
as ever, hut are paying out of their own,
pockets for public improvements which !
are of benefit to but a small portion of
the city. /
Months ago influences were at work
that caused a revival of public spirit in |
Oakland. At least that was the way in
which the spasm was represented. Men
who stated that they paid taxes on i
116,000,000 worth of property commenced
a campaign to have certain improve- :
ments carried out. These improvements
were necessary, but Mayor Snow, then
Auditor, and several practical men de- j
clared that it would be far more Teasorf- i
able to spread the expenses of these im- j
provements over two fiscal years rather !
than to pauperize the city by taking all j
the money from one year's taxes. The '
claim that all the money could be spent
and the contract fulfilled before the end !
of this year Is now absolutely refuted 1 , '
for even a miracle of the ordinary kind
could not result in carrying out the vast
Improvements within the stated time.
All this was set forth at the time, but it
met with nothing more responsive than a
deaf ear.
The "Story of the Silver-mounted
Gavel" would be the truthful title of the
history of Oakland's misgovernment for
the past nine months. Night after night
those gentlemen interested in improving
the lake gathered at the council chamber
and by their presence aided in the pas
sage of legislation favoring the scheme.
On one occasion Auditor Snow remarked
that for sixteen millions to sit behind City
Councilmen was nothing short of mild
coercion, and he saiu if he had his way
he would say: "Gentlemen, go home and
leave the city's business to the city's
officials." However, piece by piece the
vast scheme went through, and when the
measure was passed appropriating all the
money from the fund of one year there
was tumultuous applause from the in
fluential lobby and a week later Presi
dent Heitmannâ one of the late "solid
six"â was presented with a silver-mount
ed gavel in token of the appreciation in
which he was held for the manner in
which he- hail fostered the impolitic legis
lation regarding Lake Merritt.
Last Monday night an ordinance was
Introduced stating that the city was
bankrupt, that the only money in sight
is $57,000, which cannot be touched even
to pay the salaries of employes. This
money is held sacredly for the benefit of
Lake Merritt, and not one cent of it can
be transferred. Further on the ordinance
contained figures reducing the salary of
everybody whose emolument is not fixed
by the charter, one quarter. Although it is
not pretended that these employes were
getting more than they deserved, there
is no choice under the circumstances.
Their salaries must be reduced or the
city will be unable to run. Mayor Snow
says that somebody must get hurt strug
gling out of the pit, and he set the ex
ample of cutting his own salary one
quarter with the rest. But when the ord
inance was read no silver gavel resounded
on the- president's desk, neither was there
an influential lobby to applaud. On the
contrary there were scores of unhappy
faces of men whose salaries ranged from
$25 tee (130 per month listening to the
words that required of them so large a
Bhare of their bread-and- butter fund. It
has been calculated that this retrench
ment of salaries will save the city about
$7000 by the end of this fiscal year, and
one of the deputies has also made the cal
culation that an assessment of one-twen
tieth of one per cent on $16,000,000 will
raise $SOOO.
The- first donation toward the deficit
of any size, it should be noted, came from
"a hated corporation" and amounted
to $5750.
Perhaps one of the most amusing fea
tures of the stringency in the city's purse
is the situation of Health Officer J. P.
Dunn. Dr. Dunn might almost be said to
have cut his own throat. Six months ago
an influential party drove around Lake
Merritt. Health Officer Dunn and several
members of the Board of Health were in
the company. The borders of the lake
were Inspected and every patch of green
slime or anything that suggested mi
crobes was shown to the doctors. Little
bottles were filled, specimens were cor
raled and for several days the bacteriol
ogists, the microscopists and the experi
mentalists of the Board of Health were
all busy making pictures and descrip
tions of gaunt death-dealing things which
Inhabited the lake. After a while a re
port was duly issued stating that the lake
was a menace to the public health; that
it was likely during the hot summer to
produce bacilli, microbes, colonies of
germs, anthrax, bubonic plague and a
few other things of which the' doctors
found mention in the text books. This
was all that was necessary. The Council
fell in line, marched along with the pro
cession and the salary of the Health Offi
cer has been cut one-fourth, said fourth
being his contribution toward the elimina
tion of these frightful creatures of the
lake.
There is some merit in Mr. Cuvelller's
attempt to repeal the ordinance forbid
ding the sale or smoking of cigarettes.
His main argument is undeniable. He
says that the ordinance- has not prohib
ited their sale, nor has it tended in any
way to improve public morals. It has
only operated to send the legitimate trade
of Oakland to San Francisco. The ordi
nance, it Is suggested, was passed in the
Interest of a firm of manufacturers who
sell cigarette tobacco but not ready-made
cigarettes, and ii was reserved for Mr.
Cuvellier to discover the ghost in the
woodpile. A State law makes It a crime
to sell to minors, and it is very doubtful
If a local law making it a crime to sell
to adults would stand. It has never been
tested simply because it has never been
enforced.
In the general desire of the new city
administration to stamp out gambling
there is danger that the crusade may be
carried too far. A measure of this kind
must be very clear and also beyond the
possibility of being ridiculed. At this
Urns can be found Is turned into a gam
session of Oakland. This cannot be de
nied. Every place wnere sufficient vic
tims can be found is turned into gam
bling den, and this Inclination to "amble !
Is rapidly increasing. In suppressing it
there must be a line drawn, and it is
useless to be blind to this fact. An or
-inance that will, in effect, make it a mis
demeanor to match nickels on a street car
to pay the fare, or to shake dice for a
drink, will not Tie popular, but will be
.subject to ridicule-. These are not the
?vlls which it is sought to reach, for per
nicious as they may be. these practices
nave never yet landed a man in jail. The
suppression of keno dens and similar in
itltutions is imperatively demanded. One
visit to these places will convince any-
Dody of their demoralizing effect. If any
thing could be more thoroughly depraved
:han a keno den, where 10 per cent of the
pool is held out, but returned to the win
ner in beer checks. I cannot conceive of I
It. In one joint there were 176 players, |
mostly youths, a few of them boys, sitting i
iround with cards In their hands, waiting |
for some one to win. breathing the foul- I
est of air. thick with vile smoke, and
worse, and noisy with oaths and rude
nessâand all this is not at "resent in de
fiance of the law. Surely no other argu
ment for the immediate passage of a j>rac
| tical measure is necessary. To this par
ticular den City Attorney Dow made a
| short visit of inspection a few nights ago,
i and although he has been a Police Com
. missioner for two years, he said he had
I no conception that such an abominable
; sight could be witnessed in Oakland. Be
fore he went home the special officer who
accompanied him had convinced him that
â¢ there were a'score of similar places, all
; doing a rushing business.
This legislation is admittedly of the
' most delicate kind. Oakland is near San
; Francisco. In the big city across the bay
i there is practically no restraint on such
: games, and the Oaklander seeking vicious
forms of diversion will spend his money
i across the bay. It is necessary not to do
anything which will cause people to spend
! money in the legitimate channels out of
: this city, but there is a tendency for
them to do so if sound, practical sense be
I not used in connect -~~ with an honest
desire for reform. i o promote local prog
; ress and to drive out the vicious element
â¢ of society, with a race track on one side
and a metropolis on the other, is a task
with which Oaklands's new p-ov rnment
i has now to deal, and it is not * light
I one.
The millionaire who has been sued for
a nittance for which he contracted, be-
cause of his desire to add a chanter to
the history of Alameda County, is a very
shrewd advertiser. In my humble onin
ion he suffered himself to be sued so â¦hat
all who heard of the suit would be in
duced to hunt up the history and read
that for which he ostensibly refuses to
pay. It seems to be on a oar with the
scheme of the actress who is robbed of
diamonds she never owned. As this mil
lionaire read the proofs before publication
it cannot be libelous to reproduce one
paragraph. Here it is:
The home place contains seven and a half
acres of ground, so utilized that it is in
reality a gentleman's country home, in the
heart of the city. The stables are one of
the chief features of Interest. These have
been built by Mr. â himself, and are model
ones. The main stable Is finished In polished
wood and is divided so that eight stalls and
two box stalls are most conveniently lo
cated. Then there Is the carriage house,
harness room, wash room, grooms' quar
ters, colts' apartments, and in fact all the
necessary adjuncts of a first-class stable.
On the outside are the paddocksâ some sown
with alfalfa and others reserved as a run
for the horses and cows. Mr. â Is a great
lover of horses. The carriage house con
tains some of the finest vehicles' on the
Coast. There are eight rigs of various
make, and the harness is par excellence.
It is all sliver-mounted and Indeed beauti
ful. Mrs. â is a great lover of pets. She
has fine dogs, imported goats, coons, white
rats, quail, ringdoves, pigeons and deer, all
housed ln the very best manner.
It is probably safe to say that the ca_
will be settled without a trial.
The record of this city is being main
tained. The latest fad is to thank juries
who save you from prison or hanging.
Attorney Sawyer, after arguing for a
month that Mr. Brandes of Berkeley was
as innocent as a child of the murder of
his daughter, wrote personal letters to
the Jurors, thanking them for their ver
dict, which just saves his client's neck,
but makes it possible for him to live in
prison till he goes somewhere. Now
comes Mr. Fay. also of Berkeley, and
thanks the jurors for recommending him
to the extreme mercy of the court, after
breaking his daughter's thigh by way of
punlsment for eating a piece of Easter
cakte. Surely a bouquet and a sweetly
perfumed billet-doux for each juror would
be the correct thing from Mrs. Anna Men
tel. STUART W. BOOTH.
BERKELEY LIKELY
TO ABOLISH SALOONS
THE LEADING ISSUE OF THE
CAMPAIGN.
Local Politics of the University Town
Will Be Fought Out at the
Polls To-Morow.
BERKELEY, April 9.â The campaign
of, local politics In the university town
has closed, and to-morrow the polls will
show what attitude the residents of the
city have taken toward the questions
which have sprung up during its course.
The contest will not be a mild one. On
the contrary, opinion is very sharply di
vided over both principles and persons,
and the several factions are preparing to
wage war to the bitter end.
Chief among the issues Involved is the
one raised by the churches and the Wo
man's Christian Temperance Union on
the licensing of saloons.. It is more than
likely that the city will startle itself by
finding a heavy majority vote polled
against saloons. Such are the indications
at present, and such is the opinion of
several of the older politicians who know
the field thoroughly.
It will be startling because throughout
the campaign the issue has been kept un
der the surface apparently. The advo
cates of temperance have worked in si
lence, but they have worked very effect
ively. A week ago their force was hard
ly felt; the last few days have seen the
question they are agitating assume re
markable proportions. To-morrow It
will be the dominant issue at the polls,
and the opponents of the saloon-keepers
expect to bring all their influence to bear
in one supreme effort to carry their point.
The Woman's Christian Temperance
Union has this advantage as far as any
prejudice in its favor is concerned, of
having divorced the fight altogether
from personal or party politics. It has
allied itself with no candidate and with
no platform. Together with the local
churches and the State Anti-Saloon
League the effort has been to put the
question on the ground of pure principle
by an appeal to the moral sense of the
communtiy. The appeal, in the shape of
public addresses, campaign literature and
personal canvass, has been a strong one,
and its advocates are already predicting
success.
Among other points involved in to-mor
row's election the matter of abolishing
the office of City Superintendent of
Schools has fallen to the ground. The
complete expose made by The Call of
the attempt to cripple the School De
partment by forcing it to shift along
without system and organization arouse
so much Indignation on all sides against
those concerned in the scheme that they
were forced to change front and drop the
issue entirely. The candidates nominated
on the understanding that they would
do away with the office of City School
Superintendent still remain on the ticket,
but one and all have placed themselves
on record as retracting their former
stand.
State Sunday-School Convention.
BERKEYEY, April 9.â The State Sun
day School Association of California. will
| hold its annual convention here, beginning
i Tuesday of this week. The meeting will
| be a small one, attended by but a few del
egates. The Rev. Charles E. Locke of the
Central Methodist Church, San Francisco,
has been chosen to deliver the opening
' address next Tuesday night. The local
I churches will be represented by one or two
delegates, but will take no part in the re
! ception of the convention members. No
j programme of exercises has been printed
yet, as the deliberations are to be mostly
informal. The First Congregational
I Church on Dana street has been selected
as the place of meeting.
Much Business to Transact.
OAKLAND, April 9.â The City Council
will meet to-morrow night, and there is
much important business to be trans
acted. The ordinances prohibiting gamb
ling and. reducing the salaries of all city
employes will be passed to print, and also
the ordinance repealing the ordinance ap
propriating $50,000 to build a storm sewer
in Cemetery Creek. .- -

Yet he is human, has a home,, and

M. G. Sawyer, and he is in his sixty
ninth year. For the past thirty-five
years he has sat by the window in the
old Postoffice and signed all kinds of
receiptsâ tissue paper and otherwise.
When he goes to heaven it is expected
that St. Peter will give him the same
old job in the registry department of

Mr. Sawyer first chained himself to

After him were James Coey, Napoleon B. Stone, Samuel W. Backus, W. J.
Bryan, Frank McCoppln, and the present Postmater, W. W. Montague.
Through all these changes of party administration old man Sawyer has stuck
to his post, a faithful servant of the Government, and is expected to remain

W. W. TAYLOR HEARD FROM.
His Family's Anxiety as to the Safe-
ty of the Popular Insurance
Agent Over.
BERKELEY. April 9.â W. W. Taylor of
Warring street, who was believed by his
family to have met with some untimely
end while traveling in the South, has
been heard from at last, and all anxiety
and apprehension as to his safety are
over.
Mr. Taylor is an agent of the Fireman's
Fund Insurance Company. He left Berke
ley about a month ago to visit the south
ern part of the State in the interests of
his firm. His family received letters from
him regularly for two weeks, but after
that all word from him suddenly stopped.
As he was very regular in his communi
cations his failure to write excited the
greatest alarm.
The last letter was dated from Los An
geles, and according to the police of
that city his friends and relatives here
sent telegram after telegram inquiring for
the missing man. The Los Angeles police
worked on two different clews, organiz
ing search parties in each case. Neither
attempt was of avail. One resulted
in the capture of an escaped murderer
who had stolen his liberty and was wan
dering in the hills at large. The other
brought to light an insane man who had
escaped from his ward. But no trace
could be found of the missing insurance
agent.
The family had already resigned itself
to hear a fatal report at any moment,
when a telegram from the City of Mexico
announced Mr. Taylor's arrival there. For
some reason or other his letters had not
been forwarded, and he had been obliged
to go farther south than he had expected
before leaving. He will reach Berkeley
from Mexico to-morrow on the southern
overland. â¢â¢.:.'

EDSON AVERSE
TO ACTING AS
A CATSPAW
Will Move to Reconsider the
Railroad Commission's
Action.
Blackstock Will Make a Stand in Favor
of Abandoning the Pending Liti
gation Without Delay.
Railroad Commissioners Edson, Lau
meister and Blackstock are not in the
Fame accord with one another as they
were apparently at the last session of the
commission, and there promises tee he- a
lively session to-day. . At the last meet-
Ing there was a unanimous vote on the
resolution rescinding the resolutions of
the former board," which provided for a
2r> per. cent reduction in freight rates in
the future and for an Immediate reduc
tion of 8 per cent in grain rates on the
]iÂ»ies of the Southern Pacific Qompany.
To "this resolution of rescission was at
tached a proviso suggested by Commis
sioner imeister that grain rates should
be reduced 8 per cent.
Blackstock was the father of the
original resolution. His idea was that the
passage of it allowed the suit of the
Southern Pacific to fall to the ground, as
it withdrew the- cause of the action.
Laumeister claims that the proviso
must be carried "in before. the resolution
of scission becomes effective and that
the Southern Pacific must dismiss its
case before any reductions can be made
by the commission.
Edson is opposed to the entire proceed
ings of the last meeting. He is not In
favor of the commission taking the initia
tive In any contemplated compromise, but
believes thai the first step should be
made by the railroad company and thai
this step should be the dismissal of the
pending suit. At the meeting to-day he
will move for a reconsideration of the
rescission resolution.
Commissioner Edson arrived from Ga
zelle and Commissioner Blackstock from
Ventura yesterday, to attend the meeting
of the board to-day. Both put up at the
Occidental Hotel, where they were inter
viewed-
"I intend to move for a reconsideration
of the resolution of rescission," said Com
missioner Edson. "I was never in favor
of It, and voted for it simply to be able
to move for a reconsideration, as I
thought we should have a better under
standing of the matter beiore taking
final action. I have some doubts of the
power of this board to rescind the action
of its predecessor. In this connection I
have submitted a number of questions to
Attorney General r-ord. One of these was
whether we had authority to rescind the
resolutions of reduction adopted by the
old board. Another was whether we had
the power to rescind the 25 per cent reso
lution without rescinding the v per cent
reduction on grain rates. I also suggested
that he secure the assistance of W. VV.
Foote and Robert Y. Hayne in the consid
eration of this great question, if he
thought it advisable, as they handled the
case in conjunction with the former At
torney General, W. F. Fitzgerald.
"I don't think we ought to compromise
with the railroad company until they
make the first move. They ought to dis
HIRSCH MEMORIAM.
Rabbi Levy Delivers an Address on
the Great Woman Philan

Rabbi Levy held services at the Beth
Israel Synagogue last night In memoriam
of the Baroness Hirsch, the great Russian
philanthropist. The altar was decorated
in white, and the services were of great
solemnity.
The quartet rendered four selections:
"Man, His Days Are Like a Shadow,"
'(Â» Lord, What is Man?" "Rest. Spirit,
Rest," "Man, Art Thou Not Created From
Dust?"
"Many daughters have done well, but
thou excellest them all," was the subject
of Rabbi Levy's address. He said: "The
Baroness Hirsch is the greatest woman
of this century. She has given to charity
$25,000,000 without distinction of.creed. Her
goodnes has been showered unon all peo

of that city she has distributed over two

Rev. Dr. Locke on "Shams."
The subject of Rev. Dr. Locke of the
Central Methodist Church. Mission street,
was "Shams." The scriptural text for
the evening was St. Luke xii:l. On this
Dr. Locke said* "Hypocrisy is a grace
less excrescence of civilization. As truth
is at enmity to a lie, as purity shrinks
from corruption, so heaven abhors
hypocrisy.
"There are business shams. Much that
passes for shrewd financiering is noth
ing leu than highway robbery. It does
eeem that the American people like to be
humbugged if one can Judge from the
prosperity of cheap and shoddy business
houses. . '
"There are social and political shams.

miss the case against the commission and
then trust to us to do what is right in the
matter. My Idea Is not to pull other peo
ple's chestnuts out of the fire .or tnem.
The railroad company began the suit and
they should dismiss it. If we allow the
suit to go li- default we will have to pay
the costs, and I believe that the railroad
company should be made to do tnis. This
is my opinion, but I have also asked the
Attorney General to look Into the ques
tion of costs. He will appear before the
commission to-morrow, when all these
questions will be discussed and probably
settled."
Commissioner Blackstock stood firmly
by his resolution and his interpretation
of it. "I understand that the resolution
of the former board was absolutely re
scinded at our last meeting," ho said.
"The- proviso of Mr. Laumeister was sim
ply a condition subsequent, or one to be
performed after the main resolution had
become effective. In my opinion our
action in withdrawing the cause of the
pending litigation will not saddle the
costs of that suit on us, but they will fall
on the railroad company. I am in favor
of getting down to business at the earli
est time-, and think grain rates should be
reduced on every railroad in the State.
The 8 per cent reduction should not be
horizontal, but should be applied where
It is most needed, even if the reductions
in some sections should be double 8 per
cent. ;'ââ¢â¢_
"I have no fear of the commission be
ing in contempt by its action in announc
ing the proposed reduction of 8 per cent
on grain rates, while the temporary in
junction of the Circuit Court is still in
force. We will not be in contempt until
our reduced schedule of rates is served
on the railroad company, and that will
not be for some weeks. 1 don't think we
will have any trouble with the railroad
company in putting in the proposed re
ductions. We have nee understanding
with the company, but I base my views
em the fact that a compromise on the

Rue by Mills. I have also learned from
Mr. La Rue that he was strongly, in" favor
of such a settlement of the controversy.
I believe in doing business right out, and

HUNTINGTON IS ILL.
The Aged Railroad Magnate Confined
to His Home by a Cold.
C. P. Huntington, president of the
Southern Pacific Company, was confined
to his home by Illness all day yesterday.
He had been Buffering from a cold on
Saturday and was given a prescription by
Dr. M. Gardner, his regular physician.
Yesterday the cold took a turn for the
worse, and owing to the absence of Dr.
Gardner from the city another physician
was called in.
It was stated at the house of the aged
and ill millionaire last night that the cold
had affected his kidneys and that he had
to take to his bed. It is believed that
there Is no serious danger, except what
may be caused by the advanced age of
the patient.
! ligious sham. 'Beware of the leaven of
the Pharisees which is hypocrisy.' Many
; so-called pillars of the church are nothing
i but hollow logs. Many of these shams
are leading double lives. 'Ye cannot
j serve God and mammon' are our Lord's
I own words. Some of these are ludicrous
ly defending their corrupt practices by
! giving the excuse of the disgraced Ken
tucky Congressman who said that he was
see-king in his pretended character of a
J Christian to neutralize the evil influences
which resulted from his sinful indulg
ences. Alas, how many of those who are
saying 'Lord! Lord!' and are not doing
. the will of the Father in heaven will hear
i at the judgment 'I never knew you; de
: part from me. ye that work iniquity."
"The persistent demand i_ for men of
absolute sincerity, S-iicere men Â«ho are
as bold as lions, as gallant as courtiers,
as valorous as knights, as meek as
Moses, as pure as a vestal, as noble as
princes, as amiable as John and as holy
j as Stephen. Let the sign 'Wantedâ
cere men!' be hung up in school and in
i church, in the forum and in the marts of
I tradeâ everywhere! The peremptory need
! is for men. The manliness of Christ Is
the true type. Let us imitate and honor
the Nazarene."
Olympic Club Tryout.
The Olympic Club Wheelmen held a five
mile tryout on the road between Hay
wards and San Leandro yesterday after
noon. The men started two minutes apart
and finished with the following times:
H. S. Bailey. 12:55 1-5; T. H. White.
12:57 2-5; George Kroetz, 13:15; R. A. Hen
derson, 13:33; Ed McNess, 13:33 3-5; Ed
Adams, 14:00 4-5; H. V. Smith, 14:06 2-5.
T. F. Meherin and T. G, Spillane acted
as starters, and John Elliott and E. G.
Montealegre as finish timers. William
Maekie, Ed Goeller and D. MacLeod were
scorers. The road was In fair condition,
but there was a stiff breeze blowing.
Accident to Mrs. James Otis.
Mrs. James Otis, while walking down
the steep hill on Taylor street from Pine
to Bush, yesterday afternoon slipped and
fell to the sidewalk and sustained a com
pound fracture of the ankle. A carriage
was immediately summoned and Mrs.
Otis was taken to her apartments at the
Occidental Hotel. Drs. Brig-ham and
Soule are in attendance upon her, and
while they apprehend no serious results
their patient will be confined to her room
for some time. Mrs. Otis is the widow
of James Otis, who was Mayor of this
city some time in the seventies.

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, APRIL 10, 1899.
UNIVERSITY OF
CALIFORNIA'S
NEW PRESIDENT
Likely to Be Benjamin
Ide Wheeler.
RUMOR GIVES HIM THE POST
:A ? â¢
THE CORNELL PROFESSOR MAY
SUCCEED KELLOGG.
He Refuses to Deny That He Has
Been Offered the Place, But Says '
He May Have â¢ Something
to Say Later.
There Is good reason to believe that the
regents of the University of California
have practicaly decided- upon the man
who is to succeed President Kellogg- at the
head of the big State educational institu
tion at Berkeley. It is more th.-vn hinted
that the new president will be. Benjamin
Ide Wheeler, professor of Greek and com
parative philology at Cornell University.
Professor Wheeler's name has been
i more or less prominently mentioned in
I connection with tin- position for some time
i past, and since his recent visit to Cali
fornia, when he lectured at the university,
the feeling that he would be selected to
take Kellogg- place has been growing
Steadily both here and at Ithaca, N. Y.
j In fact, a dispatch received from the lat
ter city last night says it is persistently
rumored at Cornell that the professor has
already been invited to accept the presi
dency at Berkeley and will in all proba
bility do so, and this rumor is given more
credence in view of the fact that the pro
fessor will not deny the report, but con-
I tents himself with saying he can neither
I deny nor affirm it, suggesting, however,
I that he may have something to say on
the subject in the course of a couple of
weeks.
Should Professor Wheeler be installed
as president of the State University the
Regents will have cause to congratulate
Prof. Benjamin I. Wheeler.
themselves upon securing a scholar and
educator who stands in the first rank and
one who' will be a credit to the institu
tion and to the Slate.

MUSHROOMS
MAY HAVE KILLED
MRS. McNALLY
Wife of an Attorney
Succumbs.
AN AUTOPSY WILL BE HELD
LINGERED A WEEK AFTER THE
MEAL WAS TAKEN.
Relatives Suspect That Poison From
a Previous Illness Became Active
in the Blood and Caused
.!,;. Death.
The wife of Frank H. McNally, an at
torney residing at 723 Gough street, died
yesterday under circumstances that indi
cate she was a victim of poison introduced
into her system through the agency of
mushrooms. The matter was reported to
Coroner Hill, under whose instructions
Dr. Zabala will hold an autopsy this
morning. Mrs. McNally was 34 years of
age and was the mother of two children.
She was formerly a Miss Schaefer of
Marysville. :â¢ 'L :
The Coroner was informed that the
mushrooms to which the death of Mrs.
McNally may have been traceable were
eaten a week ago yesterday at the Nevada
restaurant on Geary street. The husband
and wife took dinner there that evening,
and among other things Mrs. McNally
partook of the fungi. No evil effects were
felt from them during that night or the
next day, and it was not until Tuesday
evening last that Mrs. McNally com
plained of being ill, not sufficiently so,
however, to necessitate a call for a phy
sician. She suffered considerably Tues
day night and "Wednesday morning, but
no suspicion was entertained that poison
was undermining her life.
Mrs. McNally continued to grow worse
as the week wore on until Saturday night
her condition was alarming. 'It was
then thought that she had a return of
peritonitis, which nearly caused her death
a year before. On this belief application
was made to a druggist in the neighbor
hood, who gave a prescription intended to
relieve her pain. She took the medicine,
but it did not have the desired effect, and
it was decided finally to call in a physi
cian.
Dr. J. H. Barbat was summoned at mid
night Saturday and prescribed for the sick
woman. He made a second call yesterday
morning at 5 o'clock and found his patient
dead, after having suffered great agony.
He notified the Coroner of the circum
stances, but that official, at the request
ol the relatives, allowed the body to re
main at the home.
The lapse of time from the partaking
of the mushrooms till the first symptom of
illness and the.- gradual sinking from
then on until death a week later makes
the case appear a strange one at first
glance, yet it is state. that such cases
are not absolutely unknown. The rela
tives of Mrs. McNally do not believe
that her deatu was caused in that man
ner. They believe that if any toxic
agent was at work it was one that had
lain dormant in the blood for more than
a year, when Mrs. McNally suffered from
peritonitis. "While Coroner Hill seems
inclined to think the same way, he says
that it might have been possible for Mrs.
McNally to have eaten the mushrooms
last Sunday, as stated, and not suffer
from them other than she did.
Muscarin, a narcotic alkaloid, is the
active principle of poisonous fungi. The
symptoms of Its presence are usually felt
within a few hours after the mushrooms
are eaten, but may not show themselves
for a considerable time. When the poison
does manifest its presence, however, it
is with considerable violenceâ
vomiting and a violent colic. Great
mental excitement is noticeable in the
sufferer, almost invariably followed by
coma. It is generally believed by medical
men that until the poison gets into the
circulation no great harm can be done.
Once in the blood, however, death in
variably ensues. -
Whether or not Mrs. McNally died as
a result of muscarin poison, the state
ment that she ate the mushrooms con
taining it at the Nevada restaurant last
Sunday is denied by the proprietor, N. P.
Doupv. He says that mushrooms were not
on the bill of fare at any time last Sun
day. _
OLD VETERANS AT VALLEJO
Enjoyable Reception Tendered Sol
Cahen Saturday Night.

ception was tendered to Sol Cahen, de

touching upon the lofty patriotism in
spired by the Grand Army and the lessons
to be learned by its existence. He was

W. H. Roberts Tried the Morphine
Route, but Was Not Successful.
W. H. Roberts, a wood molder em
ployed by C. F. Shaw, 2135 Fillmore street,
swallowed a dose of morphine in a rear
room in the Globe saloon, 30 Turk street,
yesterday afternoon. He was taken to
the Receiving Hospital, where the usual
remedies were administered and Roberts
was pronounced out of danger. He had
left the following note addressed to the
bartender in the saloon:
Dear Fred: Good by. I have some clean
clothes down at J. Brown's room at the Royal
lodging house, on Fourth street, room 22.
Please see that I have them on. Speak a pood
word for me to Emma, at 110 Taylor street.
Let the boys know all. They are in Bakers
fleld. Send word to my little girl and wife,
room 37, 606 Montgomery street. Good by.
DAD.
I am sad at heart, but I can't do as I would
like to do. â¢ If I had a $20 piece It would save
my life this morning, but I have not got It,
bo good by. . DAD.
Roberts said he wanted a good long
sleep, as he was tired of life. He had
been divorced from his wife and had
nothing to live for.
San Mateo Line Improvements.
The San Francisco and San Mateo elec
