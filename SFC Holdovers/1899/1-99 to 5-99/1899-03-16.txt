SECRETS OF STATE
ARE REVEALED BY
SPAIN'S RED BOOK
How the Queen Regent's Commission
Tried to Get the Better of the
Americans.
NEW YORK, March 15.â
[ Herald's Washington corre
spondent sends the following:
I obtained to-day a copy of the Red
Book of Spain containing all the doc
uments relating to the peace nego
tiations recently presented to the
Cortes by the Minister of State. These
documents throw an interesting light
on the negotiations of the conference
in Paris, detailing the moves made
by the Spanish commissioners in
their efforts to shoulder upon the
United States the great Cuban debt
and to preserve to Spain the Philip
pine archipelago.
Perhaps the most notable feature
of the documents is that whicn indi
cates that the Spaniards were appre
hensive, up to the time of the signing
of the treaty, that the United States
would break off negotiations and re
sume hostilities; while the fear on the
part of this Government was that
the Spanish commissioners would
withdraw and thus necessitate a con
tinuance of warlike operations.
The book shows that the Spanish
commission and the Spanish Gov
ernment were convinced that the
treaty concluded was the least pre
judicial to Spain possible, considering
the circumstances surrounding the
negotiations, and it is expressly
stated by Montero Bios, president of
the Spanish commission, that the
commission believed that the United
States proposed to annex the island
of Cuba, notwithstanding the dis
claimers made by this Government.
The book opens with the invitation of
the French Government for the Ameri
can and Spanish commissioners to con
duct their negotiations and salle dcs
conferences at the French Foreign Of
fice. The first passage between the
commissioners relates to the request of .
the' 'Spanish commissioners for the '
maintenance of the status quo existing -
in the Philippines at the time of sign
ine: the protocol, to which the Ameri
cans replied that the matter was in |
way of a settlement between the two
governments, and as commissioners
they had no jurisdiction.
Commenting upon this the Spanish
Minister for Foreign Affairs stated that
considering the conduct observed by
the American troops, the commissioners
In Paris would naturally evade any
answer to questions propounded to
them by the Spanish commissioners as
to the status in these islands, and that
the excuse given by the American com
missioners certainly was very unsatis
factory.
Senor Rios complains on October 5
that the American commissioners, in
the draft of a treaty presented by them
relating to the relinquishment of sov
ereignty over Cuba, do not suggest in
whose favor such relinquishment is to
be made and he calls attention to the
fact that its acceptance of this would
prevent Spain from demanding through
the treaty that the United States or
some other power should assume the
obligations and burdens of all kinds
now resting on Spain and which grew
out of the exercise of her sovereignty
over Cuba.
The firmness of the belief of the
Spanish commissioners that the United
States proposed to annex Cuba is found
in these extracts in a letter from Senor
Rios to the Minister of Foreign Affairs,
dated October 12:
Upon observing that the paper present
ed in writing by the American Commis
sioners rejecting our draft of the first two
articles of the treaty was based on the
supposition that we proposed therein that
the United States accept sovereignty over
Cuba, to transfer it at the proper time to
the Cuban people, I called their attention
to the Inaccurate translation of our artl

cles, which do not say the United States
must accept, sovereignty over the island
of Cuba to "transfer" it at the proper
time to the Cuban people, but that they
"may transfer" it at the proper, time to
that people. )
This correction produced a visible ef
fect on the minds of the American Com
missioners, which tended to confirm us in
our former presumption that the United
States proposed to annex the island of
Cuba. They do not manifest this con
clusively, hut, on the contrary, neither do
they desire that the obligations which
they spontaneously contracted to trans
fer said sovereignty to the people of Cuba
should be recorded in the treaty, and
above all they do not wish that Spain
should reserve in the treaty the right of
demanding of them the performance of
this obligation.
Presuming the purpose of annexation
which the American Government - enter
tains, we should improve In the coming
discussions the benefits which it offers
us advantageous to the interests of Spain.
The United States, in their joint resolu
tion, spontaneously stated that they did
not demand of Spain the sovereignty of
SAN FRANCISCO, THURSDAY, MARCH 16, 1899.
the island of Cuba save to transfer it to
. the people thereof, that they might be- ]
come, independent. Spain, therefore, would
be acting perfectly within her rights in
demanding the performance of this spon
taneous obligation. . Upon not demanding
it. it. does them a service which requires
proportional compensation.
This Commission understands that it
.should limit itself wholly to not demand
ing this performance, but abstaining from
any manifestation whatever either for or
against annexation. If ' annexation id
agreeable to the United States, this com
mission- believes that they ' will surely
'carry it into effect without the necessity
of requesting it of Spain, and if It is not
agreeable this commission also under
stands that Spain absolutely lacks the
means of imposing it upon them. The
United States will remain after the treaty
in the same situation they were when
Congress approved the joint resolution of
April 20 of this year.
In a confidential dispatch to the Min
ister of Foreign Affairs Senor Rios, un
der date of October 18, says the United
States demands the abandonment of
the West Indies and that although they
consider it their bounden duty to pro
tect Spanish citizens and property in
the islands, they do not wish to have
this set forth in the treaty as the lat
ter, so far as it relates to these islands,
should contain nothing more than the
first two articles of the protocol.
"I presume," says Senor Rins, "on
good grounds that the same thing will
occur with regard to the Philippines.
The United States will immediately im
pose their conditions upon us, but will
not bind themselves to anything in our
-favor. Therefore if this happens the
treaty will be a singular thing in diplo
matic history, for It will be reduced to
one of the parties submitting uncon
ditionally to the demands and exac
tions imposed by the other without the
latter recognizing in the former any
right or making any concessions what
ever to it."
Senor Rios goes on to suggest a happy
medium between the demands of the
United States and Spain's refusal to
accede to them, and says:
This medium consists in substituting
for a treaty a minute, in which there shall
appear the exactions of the United States
with respect to Spain, and a statement by
the latter of the absolute helpless condi
tion in which she finds herself, owing
to lack of . means to oppose such exac
tions; and that. in consequence, she gives
way to force, abandoning that which the
United States demands she shall deliver
over and protesting against the injustice
and violence of such demands.
The United States, I know, cannot af
ter such, a manifestation on the part of
Spain renew the war, since everything
they ask Is acceded to, although the right
to make such demands ls not recognized
and their Injustice is protested against.
It is clear that the consequence of this
would be absolute and complete rupture
of all kinds of relations between Spain
and the United States for. an indefinite
time; but on the other hand it offers the
advantage of preventing new disasters to
our unfortunate country.
The demand of the United States for
the cession of the entire Philippine ar
chipelago brought an indignant mes
sage to Senor Rios from Madrid stat
ing that "such demand, in the form it
is made, far oversteps the uttermost
pretensions it could be supposed the
United States would have." f^yffy

weather has been playing on him.
* He has a particular grievance
against the present storm, and although
he rejoices with everybody else over the
timely downfall, he can't help feeling
that it played him a shabby trick in
sneaking In upon him without an in
stant's warning, thereby destroying the
last vestige of his reputation as a weather
prognosticator.
He says it's a mighty low-down storm
that will trail onto a northwest wind with
frost on the side and jump in from the
ocean without hitting the coast some
where to the north of us first. That may
be Boreas' idea of humor, he says, but
Boreas has no business monkeying with
frivolities. r'b.y
"It may be all very funny this throw
ing an honest, conscientious citizen down
who is doing the best he can to bring off
weather conditions to suit the indica
tions, but blame me if I can see what's
going to become of me if the rain and
frost and wind don't pay any more at
tention to the probabilities than they
have in the past. It's all right
enough for the rain to hold off when I
predict that it will arrive on a certain
date; that has been the case so fre
quently ever since the Government took
a hand in the management of the weather
that the people have got so they expect it
and sort of regard it as all right and a
part of our business. But here comes
this rain that everybody has been hoping
for and praying for, jam up against a pe
riod of northwest wind ana frost, without
ever shaking a bush or blowing a horn
to indicate its arrival. It just let me size
up the indications and send out my pre
dictions, with the result that Tuesday
morning folks got up and read in their
papers at the breakfast-table that they
were going to have another day at least
of that bitter northwester with more
frost at night and looked out of their
windows at the rain slanting down on a
southeast wind, with the temperature 15
degrees higher. Such doings make me
languid ana have got to stop. I want it
distinctly understood that I'm not doing
this forecasting fo>- hygienic benefit to
myself, and if this drooling California
weather doesn't stop trifling with me I'm
going to have myself transferred to Circle
City, where a weather sharp would have

Armour's canned beef - the other eight
months.*"

and sloshes around on top of the Mills
building watching the rain gauge, the
wind gauge and the other contrivances
up there as contentedly as a spoonbill on
the Alameda flats.
The precipitation has been general from
the Oregon line to *he Tehachapi, and
although the full force of the storm has
not yet reached the latter region, it
probably will by to-day, and cross the
range and visit the extreme southern part
of the State as- well. No rain whatever
has fallen at Los Angeles, San Diego and
that section, but there is every indication
that it will receive as thorough a drench
ing as the northern part has. The south
ern coastline has fared better so far than
the Interior, for while .26 of an inch had
fallen at San Luis Obispo from yesterday
morning to 2 p. m., and Santa Barbara
had received a good wetting, only .01 of
an inch had fallen at Fresno.
The storm is now central off the Califor
nia coast, while the pressure has fallen
throughout the State. Oregon and Wash
ington. So far the rainfall has been the
heaviest in the lower Sacramento and San
Joaquin valleys and the bay counties.
Snow has fallen in the mountains as far
south as Fresno County, the fall along
the line of the Central Pacific having been
extremely heavy so far. At Blue Canyon
it measured 30 inches for twenty-four
hours and at other points it was almost as
heavy. It Is still snowing and packing
down, which insures an abundance or
water for mining and irrigation purposes.
While the frosts of Saturday, Sunday
and Monday nights undoubtedly did some
damage both to fruit md grain, it is com
paratively insignificant in view of the rain
which followed so closely and brought
succor to the bulk of the crops. A week
ago nothing but the most dismal forebod
ings were heard; to-day it would be diffi
cult to find a malcontent in the entire
State. Fears^iave been dispelled and only
the most optimistic predictions for the
year can be heard.
Californians may well rejoice.

SALINAS. March 15.â The rain storm which
has been so general all over the State reached
this city and vicinity this morning. At 8
o'clock it began to rain ln earnest, and at 1
o'clock the precipitation . was .St of an Inch,
while up to <"> o'clock to-night 1.12 had fallen.
Not only in this Immediate section, but all over
the county, the rainfall has been quite heavy
in the last twelve hours. The storm is con
sidered the salvation of Monterey County. The
situation was becoming serious and business
was virtually at a standstill. Many ranchers
had already left parts of this county for other
points, while those that remained tried to de
vice some . means of Irrigation. -Up to yester
day over 100 irrigation plants were In operation
for the first time in the Immediate vicinity of
Salinas. Many orders for outfits have been
canceled now on account of the rain. All
farmers In this vicinity are sure of j a crop.

PAYERS FOR RAIN
IN THE CHURCHES
LOS ANGELES, March 15. â This was the day set apart for humilia
tion and prayer, and the storm clouds are at hand as if in readiness to
precipitate a downpour in answer to the fervent supplications sent
heavenward.
"Man shall not live by bread alone," was the keynote of the prayer
service held at the First Methodist Church. Whether business men
deemed this an unseemly hour to indulge in prayer for rain, or whether
they have more faith in the artificial means suggested to the Cham
ber of Commerce by different experts, is hard to say. Certain it is that
the business element was not largely represented. Rev. Mr. Smith had
charge and spoke earnestly of the Indifference of the people to accept
the promises of God. He dwelt upon the necessity of rain in the spirit
ual world. That, he said, was more necessary than rain in the phy
sical world. He believed God was abie to answer the prayers of His
children.
The Christian Alliance held services of humiliation, and the members
sought with prayer and fasting to place themselves in line with the
will of God and know why He withheld rain from the earth.
The Woman's Christian Temperance Union heeded the call for hu
miliation and held an all-day service in accordance with the general
supplication for spiritual and physical rain. This evening services were
held in the Congregational, First Christian, Vincent Methodist Episcopal
and Episcopal churches. .

MILTON. March 15.â Rain has fallen steadily
since yesterday morning, and to-day the heav
iest storm experienced in two years prevailed.
An abundance of rain is now assured, not only
for farmers, but for mining operations as well.
As many new mines are only waiting for a
sufficient water supply, a season of the greatest
business activity ever known in the southern
mining district of the State Is assured.
SAN JOSE. March 15.â The heaviest rainfall
that has occurred In the Santa Clara Valley
for three years brought great rejoicing to-day.
In this city for the twenty-four hours up to 16
o'clock tonight. 1.30 Inches fell, making 2.29 for
the storm and nearly 10 Inches for the season,
as compared with 5.4S to the same date last
season. The creeks are flowing good and rapid
ly swelling. Irrigating ditches to the orchards
are being taken advantage of -on all sides. The
fruit, grain and hay crops, have been saved,
which means millions of dollars to the valley.
At points outside of this city there was a much
heavier downpour than" here. From Wrights 5
inches were reported up to 6 o'clock this even
ing, and at Los Gatos 4.26 Inches. It Is still
raining.
SAN LUIS OBISPO, March 15.â A light rain
began falling this morning, but ceased before
noon. Toward evening it commenced again,
acd by 8 o'clock .'0 of an inch had been meas
ured. It ls coming down steadily, and re
ports cf a good rain have been received from
all over the ccunty. There is every indica
tion of a continual downpour all night.
The spirits of the people have been
revived as the rain means the saving of every
farmer who was on the brink of ruin, be
sides merchants who were carrying them on
their books. The prospects for a good crop
are excellent and the output will probably be
the largest known here, as a larger acreage
has been sown than in any previous season.
The feeling of gloom since the banks went into
liquidation has been dispelled and everybody
Is happy and confident.
SUISUN, March From Tuesday morning
to this afternoon the precipitation in Solano
County amounted to 1.5". with prospects for a
continued heavy downpour. A remarkable
change is noticeable .among business men.

insures a grain yield that will be enormous in
the Montezuma hills. Sulsun and Vaca valleys

neighboring sections last week. Prospects now

ing the water supply for different towns. It is
expected the coming season will be one of un
equaled prosperity in Solano County.
STOCKTON. March 15.â The rainfall up to 9
o'clock to-night, according to the gauge at the
State Hospital, was 1.3S Inches, making 1.50 for
the month and 8 inches for the season, against
494 to the same date last year. The loss of
the wheat crop is placed beyond possibility by
' the fall of to-day. Reports from Tracy, on the
, west side, and from Clements. In the northern
' part of the county, are of heavier precipita
i tion there than in Stockton, and that is where
: rain will do the greater amount of good. The
I acreage in wheat in San Joaquin County, par
i ticularly on the west side, is larger than for
; many years, and a greater prosperity is there
i fore sure to follow the making of a big crop.
FRESNO, March 15.â high wind blew from
the south all day and the sky was obscured
Iby dense clouds. The temperature, however,
was too high for rain until late in the after
noon, when a downpour began which has con
i tinued steadily for several hours, and bids fair
to be one of the heaviest storms ever exepri
enced in this part of the valley. Up to IS
o'clock nearly three-quarters of an Inch had
fallen, and the rain was still coming down In
torrents. The precipitation which has already
| occurred will be of material benefit to the crops
throughout the county. Very little of the grain
; is entirely beyond redemption except on the
i west- side, and" in that locality a good hay crop
: is assured.
SACRAMENTO. March 15.â The rain which
set in at daylight Tuesday morning has con

the rivers up well, helping the miners, the
electric company that supplies power and lights
to this city and the logging industry along the
American River. The rain continues to-night
and the prospects are good for a prolonged
storm.
BERKELEY. March 15.â Rain has fallen here
very heavily since 6 o'clock yesterday evening.
The downpour was almost continuous. For
twenty-three hours from 2 o'clock yesterday
afternoon until 1 o'clock this afternoon over
two Inches had fallen. The ralngauge at the
observatory of the University of California reg
istered 2-ftS inches during that time. The fall
has continued almost uninterruptedly since
â  then. For the whole storm, which began at 3
o'clock Monday night, the amount has been a
little less than 2.7 inches. This makes 14.665
Inches for the entire season, as against 11.552
inches last year
AUBURN. March 15.â The fall of rain which
commenced here yesterday morning has been
almost unprecedented, 2.90 inches falling dur
ing the past forty-eight hours. The total for
the season is 19.19, as against 16.42 last season.
It is still raining. Some snow fell in the
mountains, but the weather is warmer and the
rain has extended to very high altitudes. Al
though grain could have stood the drought a
while longer, this storm will do an immense
amount of good.- especially in the replenishment
of the water sheds, upon which both the
miners and fruit men depend during the sum
mer months. - v y
VACAVILLE. March 15.â Light rain began
falling on Tuesday morning at 5 o'clock and
has continued up to the present time, the total
precipitation for thirty-six hours being two

for a continuance. The. second bloom on the
apricots, it is thought, will yield a quarter
crop. There will be heavy crops of peaches,
plums, prunes, . pears and cherries if there be
CUBAN ASSEMBLY
IN DEFIANT MOOD
A Threat of Armed Resistance*
to the Power of the United
States.
Special Cable to The Call and New York Herald. Copyrighted, 1899, by
James Gordon Bennett. : Y.fyf
HAVANA, March 15. The Cuban Assembly will to-morrow Issue a ]
manifesto declaring that it is the only representative body in Cuba; that
General Gomez Is attempting, with the aid of the United States, to
make himself dictator, and that as a general proposition the United
States has no right to interfere with the domestic affairs of the island.
This is the latest development in the situation.
It is generally believed that Gomez will not submit to the author
ity of the Assembly, notwithstanding his apparent acquiesence in all that
body has yet done. b
The feeling to-night is that the President's decision to suppress the ;
Assembly will lead to a conflict between the American administration
and the Cubans in arms. While General Gomez has the popular sym- ;
pathy among civilians, the army, with a view to obtaining more money
than the $3,000,000, and dominated by sentiments inculcated by Gomez >
before his adherence to Mr. Porter's proposition, is inclined more to
the stand taken by the Assembly. b;
Â.-. The Assembly will not recognize General Brooke's authority to dis- ;
solve that body. Late to-night they had had no notification from him
of any instructions from Washington to this effect. If formally noti
fied they will protest against the suppression of the_ only representative j
revolutionary body on the island, and will issue orders to the army to
resist any arbitrary measures of the United States Government. v 1

no frost. So far no damage has been done.
All fruit is about a month earlier than last
year. The grain in this vicinity never looked
better, and a big hay and grain crop is ex
pected.
WOODLAND, March 15.â The weather has
been stormy all day. and the showers, although
Intermittent, have been very heavy. The wind
continues to blow steadily from the south, and
the Indications are favorable for a storm of
two or three days' duration. At S o'clock this
morning the precipitation for the storm
amounted to .66 of an inch, making a total of
9. 50 inches for the season. During the day the
rainfall was not less than a half Inch. Enough
has already fallen to greatly benefit farmers
and fruit growers, and the prevailing opinion
is that there will be sufficient to insure good
crops.
MARYSVILLE, March 15.â Between 4 and T
o'clock this evening this section experienced
the heaviest downpour of rain witnessed in
several years. The sewer system waa inade
quate to carry away the water and in many
places the streets are flooded their entire width.
For a time it was feared the water would cover
the sidewalks and enter the stores. To add
to the discomfort the city electric lighting sys
tem is on a strike when most needed.
SANTA ROSA, March 15.â Heavy rain con
tinued nearly all day. Reports from all over
Sonoma County show the storm has been gen
eral. Indications are the rain will continue all
! night.
OAKLAND, March Everywhere orchard
ists and agriculturists are reporting the salva
tion of their crops through the present storm.
One of the biggest fruit growers in this county,
H. W. Meek, had begun smoking his orchards
'last Sunday night, as the trees were in full
bloom and one frost would have been fatal.
The. rain storm has saved the crop and enough
rain has fallen to insure a good season. Be
tween 1 p. m. yesterday and the same hour to
day 2.01 inches fell in this city, and it has
! rained heavily at intervals since.
SANTA CRUZ, March 15.â The rain has been
steady the entire day. and at times has been
very heavy. The precipitation up to 6 o'clock
this evening has been about three inches, with
all indications pointing to a. continuance of the
storm. At Big Creek to-day there was a cloud
burst and five inches of water wag precipitated.
San Lorenzo River, which yesterday was the
lowest for years, is now booming, with drift
wood floating down. The bay has been very
rough. A number of fishermen's boats v. ere
capsized and washed ashore.
LOS ANGELES, March 15.â The barometer
is falling west of the Rocky Mountains and

PROOF THAT VILE
CANNED BEEF WAS
FED TO SOLDIERS
CHICAGO. March 15.â The last wit
ness called before the army beef
court of inquiry to-da" - proved
to be sensational. He was an
officer of the regular army.
First Lieutenant M. F. Davis, of
the First Cavalry, called at the
request of Major Lee. the represen
tative of General Miles. Lieutenant
Davis testified that in Cuba one-half
of the canned roast beef issued to the
soldiers was thrown away because It
was unfit to eat. He testified that he
had opened one can himself and found
maggots in it.
Major Lee asked:
"How did the maggots get In there?"
"They were canned In there." the
witness replied.
Colonel Davis said:
"Are you aware that in the process
of canning this meat undergoes such
an intense heat that no animal life
could survive In it?"
"I don't mean to say they were
alive: they were dead."
The board left for Omaha to-night.
Inspection of the stock yards will be
made at Omaha and Kansas City, and
at the latter city some evidence will
be taken. The intention of the court is
to return to Chicago by next Tuesday
and proceed with the examination of
witnesses here.
The evidence brought forth to-day
was largely cumulative in its nature,
mainly with reference to tha condition
of canned and refrigerated beef when
, issued to the troops on shipboard and
in Cuba, and its effect upon the sol
diers.
Dr. John B. Shaw of Joliet, 111.. surgeon
of the Third Illinois Volunteers, testified
that on the voyage from Newport News to
Porto Rico canned roast beef was issued
and there was a great deal of complaint
about it. It was stringy, pulpy and
nauseating, and did not em to nourish
the men. Much sickness followed the use
of It.
The witness attributed the sickness
to ptomaine poisoning. He believed
ptomaines would develop In the hot sun
in five or six minutes atter a can was
opened. If the meat were properly steril
ized ptomaines could not develop. While
in Porto Rico, twenty-five miles from
Ponce, the matter of rations was taken
out of the regiment's hands to a great
extent. General Grant seemed to know
more about It than anybody else. The
witness took no particular interest in
it because of the action of General
Grant.
â â¢lb- cannot violate the law."
"He did."
"Did he issue orders?"
â â¢He issued whatever he saw fit."
"The law requires the surgeons to su
pervise the cooking of that which is is
sued. Did you Interest yourself to as
certain what was being Issued to the en
listed men?"
"We saw what was issued and took it
because we could not get anything else.
We had canned roast beef nearly all the
while, and the men refused to eat It. It
was ordered condemned and we buried
a ton of it. One of tin- men said If we
did not bury it it would bury us. A board
of survey was ordered, but I never heard
anything more about it. As to the re
frigerated beef, very little of it was
used, as at least three-quarters of it
would have to be cut off. I do not think
any chemicals had been used on the meat.
It was simply Spoiled. The meat had un
doubted lv been acted upon by the heat,
which had softened It. The fat and
grease and gelatine had all intermingled
with the fiber."
Under cross-examination. Dr. Shaw told
about being called one night to look after
thÂ» men of Company A, who were re
ported to have been poisoned by eating
canned roast beef. He said they vom
ited fearfully, and It seemed that hy
podermic Injections of morphine would
hardly relieve the pain. They were sick
for some days afterward with a great
deal of diarrhea and Intestinal trouble.
"When the men ceased eating the
canned roast beef was there any ..im
provement?" asked Major Lee.
"Yes; the canned roast beef generally
gave them diarrhea and gastro enteritis."
"Did you in an official way recommend
Its discontinuance?" . '
"Yes, sir; to my immediate comman
. "Did the commissary come around and
find out how these things were?"

SECRETARY OF WAR
ALGER DOES NOT
INTEND TO RESIGN
NEW YORK, March 15.âGen
eral Russell A. Alger, Secretary
of War, to-day declared that he
had no idea of resigning his po
sition in the Cabinet and that
he had never entertained such
a purpose.
"I have never thought of re
signing," said General Alger at
the Fifth-avenue Hotel. "If I
had there would be only one
man that I would speak to about
it, 'and he is the President. I
have never exchanged a word
with him on the subject. I have
never thought cf it in any way."
General Alger said he had no
comment to make on the work
of the army board of in
quiry which is investigating
the charges that bad beef was
furnished soldiers in the Cuban
campaign. He knew nothing
about the inquiry, he said, ex
cept what he saw in the news
papers.
"I may have an opinion when
the work of the board is com
pleted," said he, "but it would
be improper for me to say any
thing at present."
"He came several times and told us it
was all right. I think it was Captain
Piper He told us it was all right and
we would have to eat it. Sometimes we
substituted what they call bacon, but a
great deal of that had maggots in it and
had to be condemned. if we had de

STANDARD OIL IN
ENGLISH POLITICS
Petroleum Bill Beaten
in Parliament.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, March 15.â 1n the House of
Commons to-day Harold James Reck
ltt. Liberal member for the Brlgg di
vision of Lincolnshire, moved the sec
ond reading of the bill raising the flash
point of petroleum from 73 to 100. In so
doing he said that it would not add ap
preciably to the cost, as many firms
had offered to supply oil at 100 flash
point at only a half cent per gallon
more than the present price.
Joseph Tullie, Irish Nationalist,
member for the South Division of Lei
trim, called the Imported American oil
"murder oil," and Alexander Use (Lib
eral), member of the Lothian Division j
of Lintlthgowshlre, ridiculed the evi
dence of Mr. Babcock, the Standard Oil
Company's director, before the Petro
leum Committee, and quoted an ad
vertisement of the Standard Oil Com
pany as bearing out the contentions of j
the supporters of the bill. .
The Parliamentary Secretary of the
Home Office, Mr. Collings, said the
Government was preparing a bill which j
it was hoped would settle the question
and carry out the recommendations of
the petroleum committee with the ex
ception of raising the flash point to 100,
which recommendation was adopted by
the committee by only a bare majority.
Mr. Collings disputed the assertion that
Great Britain was made the dumping
ground for oil which could not be used
in America. Continuing Mr. Collings
read Foreign Office reports showing
that in many States there was no law
on the subject, while in others the
flash point was the same or lower than
in Great Britain. He then 9ald:
"All the petroleum we are speaking of
is safe with ordinary care, and none
of it is safe without care. I question ;
whether accidents are due to the low
flash point. But it would be ruinous to j
dislocate the trade to the extent of .78 j
per cent, and I am convinced that the
bill if passed will sacrifice the best in
terests of the working people and tax
them, not for the benefit of the coun
try, but for the benefit of a clique
which is desirous of creating a monop
oly and increasing the price of oil."
The bill was rejected by a vote of 244
to 159. *^PP^
The Daily Chronicle, protesting vio
lently against the rejection of ' Mr.
Reckitt's bill, says: "The Government
must" be prepared for war over their
Rockefeller relief bill."
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, MARCH 16, 1899.
"What is generally termed 'canners* are
a very inferior class of cattle; I think
one-third of them . would be condemned
in any English market. Chucks and some
times meat scraped off the plates are used
for canning."
"About what per -cent of nutriment
would be left in the meat that goes in
the can?" V." y
"Little or none."
William H. Kepiogle testified that he
served in the hospital corps at Porto Rico
and that canned roast beef was frequent
ly served to the corps. He had seen three
or four cans open with maggots running
out of them. Witness stated that at
Guayamo he saw & piece of cooked fresh
beef which had maggots in it.
In reply to Major Lee the witness told
of the' sickness of one Thompson who had
nothing to eat the first day after, land
ing. The second day he was given corned
beef and hardtack, but had no way of
making coffee. The man became very
sick and died within a week.
After considering In executive session
the matter of calling more witnesses the
court took a recess until 2 o'clock.
At the afternoon session First Sergeant
Albert Salavln of the Seventh United
States Infantry testified that some of the
men complained that the canned roast
beef was not palatable. As to refriger
ated beef some of it spoiledâ about half
of and It was buried.
Captain D. H. Boughton, Third Cavalry,
testified that in his command the officers
drew the same ration as the men while
in Cuba.
"The complaint about the canned beef,"
he said, "was that the men could not
eat the meat and would not eat It unless
absolutely compelled to do so to appease
hunger. When the cans were opened the
first thing that struck the observer was
the repulsive, uninviting appearance of
the contents. Diarrhea broke out In my
company some time after the surrender
and in general conversation among the
officers we attributed it In part to the
meat."
"What complaints were there as to the
refrigerated beef?"
"well, that was had. Sometimes half
of the quarter of refrigerated beef fur
nished would be untlt for use. Subse
quent to the surrender our command did
not receive a sufficient allowance of food."
In reply to Major Lee the witness said
that canned roast beef was absolutely un
lit for a ration.
"Do you consider canned roast beef
wholesome for the American soldier?"
"It is exceedingly unwholesome. It
tastes like chips. There is no substance
and the fat and grease are absolutely re
pulsive."
Colonel Henry L. Turner, who went to
Cuba In command of the First Illinois
Infantry and became a brigadier general,
was the next witness. He Bald that on
the way to Cuba there was a good deal of
unofficial complaint about the canned
roast beef, and the result of an official
complaint was that the surgeon con
demned a lot of it and it was thrown
overboard. The cans had swollen and the
moat was very bad.
In reply to Major I^ee the witness stated
that he tried to eat some of the canned
beef, hut it nauseated him and he could
not do it. It was certainly unfit for ra
tion in the warm climate. Ho regarded
it as a contributing cause of the sickness
of the men. He had also tried to eat the
refrigerated beef, but could not, as It
gave him diarrhea.
First Lieutenant M. F. Davis of the
First Cavalry was called upon request of
Major Lee. He said that In Cuba the. men
opened all the cans of roast beef Issued
to them, but only consumed half of the ;
contents on an average; the real was
thrown away because it was unfit to cat.
The contents of the can, he said, would
be about three-quarters suet, not what
you would call meat. Perhaps one
quarter or one-fifth of tne can would be
good fiber meat; the rest appeared to be
tailings or clippings. Sometimes a can
would be entirely spoiled. Witness said
he once opened a can which smelted bad;
he examined it and found maggots in it.
Major Lee: "How did the maggots get
in there?"
"They were canned in there."
"Are you aware that in the process of
canning this meat undergoes such an in
tense heat that no animal life could sur
vive in it?"
"I don't mean to say they were alive;
they were dead."
"iTou are positive about the identity of
the animal? '
"Vis. sir; quite positive."
"In consequence of the canned roast beef
not being sufflcienty sustaining and not
having nutriment in it, did your men lack
for food?'"
"They did."
"What was the name of this brand that
you found with maggots in it?"
"It was Swift & Co.'s brand."
"Are you certain of that?"
"I am certain."
The court adjourned to meet in Omaha
to-morrow.
M'KIMLEY HIS
A DAY OF REST
Free From Politicians
For a Time.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
THOMASVILLE, Ga., March 15 â
President McKinley rested to-day. He
enjoyed the first complete day's relax
ation from the cares of office or the
fatigues of travel that he has had In
j many months. No politicians came to
: see him. The residents of Thomasville
respected his wish that he should be
free from callers or functions, and the
few things of a personal nature which
it was necessary for him to attend to
were dispatched through Assistant Sec
retary Cortelyou. All details of the
Government's business are being at
tended to in Washington, and only
I matters of policy that possibly may de
velop will be laid before the President
here.
The opinion of the people of Thomas

need of the rest he ls beginning to take
They remember him as he was four
years ago when In Thomasville prior
to his nomination. They do not think
he looks sick, but all those who saw
much of him then say his appearance
does not evidence the buoyant, alert,
vigorous strength of that time. He
looks tired and fagged.
This morning Senator Hanna took
his guests on a carriage drive about
five miles from town to the country
home of Wyman Jones, the Senator's
brother-in-law. The weather was mild
a good breeze was stirring through the
pines and the gathering clouds that in
the afternoon resulted in a shower of
rain shielded the party from the sun.
The President enjoyed the drive and

ELOQUENCE AND SOLID FACTS
SOME HUMOR ALSO INJECTED
INTO HIS -REMARKS.
Lord Charles Beresford and Other
Noted Englishmen Also Talk
at the Chamber of Com
merce .banquet.
Special iMsratch to The Call.
LONDON. March 15.â At the banquet
given to-night by the London Chamber
of Commerce, Rear Admiral Lord
Charles Beresford, who replied to the
toast to the navy, declined to be drawn
into a discussion of the Chinese situ
ation. He concluded his speech by
saying:
The company is waiting to hear a dis
tinguished guest, the new Embassador
of the United States, whom every man of
the fore and aft in this country is de
lighted to see, but I cannot be seated
without saying that I took every oppor
tunity to see the fleet of the Americans
in both the Pacific and Atlantic. I saw
a very excellent fleet, not only In the way
the ships are built but in respect of gen
eral organization and preparedness. I
need not extol its officers and men. They
are. of the same blood as our ships
and have proved what they can do
when called on. I hope the time will very
shortly come when there will be such an
understanding between the two countries
that If anything occurs disagreeable to
us or affecting our honor and safety
these two fleets will be together. That
will make much progress for peace.
Vice President Harper then submit
ted the toast of "Our Guests." coupled
with the names of Mr. Choate and
Baron Russell of Killowen. He ex
pressed his keen pleasure at the advent
of Mr. Choate at a time "when there
is every disposition to tighten the
bonds of the Anglo-Saxon race, whose
only objects are peace, prosperity, free
dom of trade and progress."
The toast was received with loud
cheers, the company standing and
shouting the name of Mr. Choate. who
was thrice cheered. Mr. Choate, on
rising to respond, received an ovation.
The United States Embassador began
jokingly, protesting that he was over
whelmed with embarrassment at being
called upon- to respond in pridrity to
the Lord Chief Justice. He felt that
when the British lion was aboct to
roar, even the Americas eagle snould
hold his peace. He was delighted, he
said, to receive and accept the invita
tion to the banquet, although he was
not at liberty to discuss British com
merce. His general instructions from
his Government were not to discuss
politics or only at extraordinarily fes
tal-occasions (laughter). After a- few
words on the subject of â¢ commerce,
which he characterized as truly "the
mainstay .of the British empire." he
concluded as follows:
I have felt, however, that I might prop
erly avail myself of this first public occa
sion to express the appreciation; of my
countrymen for the forbearance; good will
and friendship manifested to them so
freely by the British people. It. is. true,
gentlemen' that peace between the United
States and Great Britain' is the flrst in
terest of not only these two nations but
for the whole world.
Everywhere I have been treated as a
friend and as the representative of your
friends and brothers. In fact, I have
actually discovered the open doorâ open i
to such an extent as would satisfy even |
the yearnings of the rear admiral who
has made the circle of the globe In search
of it. I think I may say as a testimony
to the good feeling sought to be encour- I
aged oh our side of the water that the
President gave the best Illustration of it
when he said in my letter- of credence
that he relied with confidence upon my
constant endeavor during my stay in
Great. Britain to promote the interest and
prosperity of both nations.
I beg that you will not mistake my
meaning. .1 do not believe that, although
friends," we shall' ever cease to be rivals.
In the future, as in the past, we on our
side and you on yours will still seek every
advantage that . can fairly, be taken; but
it shall be generous and loyal rivalry, and
all questions, disputes* and' controversies
arising shall be settled by peaceful means;
by negotiations, by arbitration, by any
and every means except war.
While the last conflict, between Great
Britain and America failed to settle any
of the great questions upon which either
side took up arms; showing that between
brethren war is the worst possible means
of settling any controversy, yet in the
eighty-four years that have since elapsed,
the tremendous questions, heated words,
threatening demonstrations which would
inevitably have brought two other- na
tions into open and frequent conflict, have
occured on either side and have all been
arranged and adjusted without restort to
arms.
Referring to the Venezuelan imbrog
lio, he observed: "You know that on
our side of the water we love occasion,
ally to twist the lion's tail for the mere
sport of hearing him roar. (Laughter.)
Well, that time he/disappointed us. He
would not roar at all. He sat silent as
the Sphinx, and by dint of mutual for
bearance, our sober second thought aid
ing your sober first thought, we avoided
everything but a mere war of words."
Alluding to the satisfactory dispelling
of the cloud between Russia and Eng
land over the Neuchang railway exten
sion loan by means of peaceful diplo
macy, Mr. Choate said:
That is the kind of diplomacy which I,
who am Just entering upon a diplomatic
career, desire very much to understand,
for I am fresh enough to believe that if
these two countries, laboring together for
peace, unite their voices In demanding it
ft is almost sure In every case. (Cheers.)
I would like to quote my President again,
for the last words I heard him say were
that the United States to-day were on
better terms with every nation on the
face of the earth than it had ever been
before. (Cheers.) Now, I have little
more to- say of my own country. (Cries
of "Go on.") Our young republic had
hard work during the past century to
subdue the continent and to turn the
wilderness into a smiling and wealthy
garden. But that business is now pretty
well finished, and so last â¢ year your
Brother Jonathan started out to see the
world. He donned seven-leagueâ nay,
seven hundred league boots ana planted
his footsteps on the isles of the sea. And
what gigantic strides he made! Hawaii,
then Manila, and another step, my Lord
Charles, would have brought . him to
Hongkong. Well, our interest and com

common purpose and a united voice for
us to command peace for the mutual sup

Gentlemen, we are almost one people.
What I say is. let our voice always be ;
lifted together for the cause of human
progress arm the advancement of civili
zation, and. my word for it, if that can
always be followed, why, then, law, or
der, peace and freedom, which are the
nurses of commerce the world over, will
prevail and the cause of humanity will be
advanced. (Cheers.)

GERMAN CONSUL
AT APIA ALMOST
THREATENS FIGHT
Philadelphia Arrives at the Islands
and Americans Join Forces
With the British.
APIA. Samoa, March 10 (via Auckland, N. Z.. March 16) -Owing to threats by
the Mataifa people to burn the Malietoa villages in the island of Sayan unless
they sent taxes levied upon them, as well as a number of soldiers to support
Mataafa, the British Consul visited Savaii on the British cruiser Porpoise and the
commander of that vessel threatened to shell the villages of Mataafa s followers If
peace was disturbed. . , x .
Th* British and American Consuls have issued proclamations denying the
rumors in circulation to the effect that Mataafa had been recognized and
threatening strong action if the provisional government interfered with the
* The German Consul refused to join with the British and American represen
tatives and issued a proclamation upholding the provisional government and
denying that there had been any Interference by the Malietoa party. He add
ed to this document an extraordinary paragraph expressing the hope that the
provisional government "would be able to encounter the danger caused anew
to the peace of the Inhabitants by the English and American proclamation."
This put more heart into the rebels and therefore numbers of armed warriors
have gathered.
The United States cruiser Philadelphia, Admiral Ivautz commanding, has
arrived here and the admiral has held extended consultations with the various
Consuls, with Chief Justice Chambers and with Captain Sturdee of the Porpoise.
The provisional Government has removed the Malietoa prisoners to a strong
hold on the mainland, firing volleys over their heads during the transfer in order
to intimidate them.
A friendly feeling is shown by the officers and men of the American and
British navies here. The American admiral convened a meeting of the consuls,
the Chief Justice and the captains of the various warships including German,
on board the flagship, and it is probable that the result will be the presentation
of an ultimatum. It is generally thought that fighting is likely to occur.
SECRETS Of STATE
IRE REVEALED By
* SPAIN'S RED BOOK
Continued from First Page.
Russia, must be surprised at so enormous
an exaction by the American Government
and they will not find it very much in
harmony with the interests of each of
them in the Far East.
The first suggestion of the United
States to pay for the cession of the
Philippines which reached the Span
iards was through Embassador Porter,
who informed the Spanish Embassador
that it .had been determined by the
United States to compensate Spain for
the islands, the amount .to be deter
mined by- the American Commission
ers.
"My impression continues to be the
same as at the beginning of the nego
tiations," said the Spanish Embassador,
"that the purpose of the Americans is
to reject the Cuban debt and to pur
chase the Philippines at the lowest
possible price."
The negotiations continued until the
offer of $20,000,000 for the Philippines
was made by the American Commis
sioners and the latter had presented
their ultimatum, which called for an
answer from the Spanish Commission
ers November 28. On the previous day
the Minister of Foreign Affairs, the
Duke of Tetuan, thus concluded his in
structions upon ' this subject to the
Spanish Commissioners:.^.^::
-Neither $20,000,000 nor any other of the
propositions in the closing part of the
American ultimatum is acceptable to
Spain. In this view it would be proper to
terminate the conferences, leaving the
Americans' at liberty to dispose of what
ever they demand; but as this may pro
duce * ulterior complications and greater
ills to our country, which is anxious to
end this situation, no other means re
mains than to succumb to force, accept
ing the American proposition, but as a
-whole - and,- without analyzing or discuss
ing any* of Its parts, all of which are
equally unjust.
There was a division in the Spanish
commission as to the propriety of the
acceptance of $20,000,000 for the Philip
pines. Senor Rios himself considered
that the American proposition was far
more harmful than beneficial to Spain,
and as a last resort should offer the
West Indies and ' the Philippines to
the United States gratuitously, on con
dition that the colonial obligations
should follow them or that the United
â¢States should pay to Spain a sum suf
ficient to discharge these obligations, if
she were to assume them, and that if
the United States did not accept this
proposition it were preferable to leave
the West" Indies and the Philippines at
their "disposal, as Spain lacked the ele
ments necessary to defend them, and to
bring the negotiations to an end with
out concluding, a treaty of peace.
In a telegram, dated November 22 the
Spanish Embassador to Paris speaks of
a call made upon him by Whitelaw
Reid, in which the Commissioner in
formed him that the ultimatum pre
sented by the American Commissioners
was the last word of the United States
on the subject. To this the Spanish
Embassador replied that he considered
himself as having been notified of the
fact, and that he had no reply to make,
since all discussion was now useless
and idle.
The American terms were finally ac
cepted and then began a discussion on
the subordinate points included in the
ultimatum. In a letter dated December
11 the day after the treaty was signed.
Senor Rios, referring to the last memo
randum filed by the American commis
sion and its courteous tone, says:
As regards the question of the Maine
they (the American commissioners) de
cline to make any reply, as the estab
lished precedents and practice of
their country preclude it. The truth is
that, above all these precedents, . there
weighed upon the Americon commission
the Inability of giving any satisfactory
reply to the Spanish protest because of
the action of the President of the Unionâ
violative of the most elementary dictates
of generosity and prudenceâ in recalling
with language offensive to Spain the
Maine Incident on the most solemn occa
sion in the public life of the United States
and when the negotiations for the re-es
tablishment of peace were on the point
of terminating. -. >â¢
Spain's Red Book closes with a long
letter from Senor Rios, reviewing the
work of the Spanish commission, con
cluding in this language: -,-,-'â '-- V -.:
"This commission, in so painful a
task, had the consolation of counting
on the sympathy of the more* respect
able organs of the press of Continental
Europe, but it is also forced to mani
fest the pain it has been suffering dur
ing the negotiations because it was not
supported by the greater part of the
periodical publications, which consider
themselves unquestionably the organs
of public opinion in Spain. ' "ffff
"The Spanish commission, consider
ing the narrow limits in which it could
move and which had been irrevocably
fixed for Spain in the preliminaries of
the treaty of peace signed at Washing
ton on August 12 list, M. Cambon act
ing for Spain, during these negotiations
constantly drew inspiration for itsÂ» acts
in its purpose to save from the ruin of
the colonial empire of Spain such rem
nants as were possible, however lack
ing In importance . these remnants
might be, and above all in its uncon
querable resolve to never consent, that
the honor and dignity of the fatherland
should become stained.
"Spain had been vanquished in war.
It was indispensable that her commis
sion should not consent to her being
humiliated in bringing her peace.
"The commission believes, then, that
it has done its duty. It understands
that the treaty concluded is the least
prejudicial for Spain that it. was possi
ble to obtain, in view of the circum
stances which could not but inevitably
bear down their heavy weight upon her.
It trusts that the coming time will
demonstrate this, and it entertains the
hope that despite the solution imposed
by the terrible crisis through which the
nation has just passed, it may soon re
cover its strength and grandeur, and it
believes finally that the honor and dig
nity of the fatherland have been saved
in these painful negotiations as the
most precious remnants of the wreck
of the old Spanish colonial empire."

SUES THE SUNSET
FOR HEAVY DAMAGES
John G. McÃride Claims the Tele
-y phone Company Failed to
Deliver a Message.
TACOMA, March John G. Mc-
Bride, real estate and mining broker, to
day sued the Sunset Telephone and Tele
graph Company, a California corporation,
for $25,000 damages. He alleges that his
domestic relations have been severed and
his happiness destroyed by reason of de
fendant's failure to deliver a telegram to
him in Arizona. , - _-, 'â '__ '._*
The complaint recites that McÃride
went from his home near Lake Park,
Ariz., prior to September, 1898. On the
26th of that month his son telegraphed
him concerning the serious illness of his
daughter. The telegram was filed at
Parkland and addressed to the plaintiff
at Jerome, Ariz. It was paid for at the
Parkland office. It was as follows:
J. G. McÃride, Jerome, Ariz.â Father, Maggie
is dying. Send money at once. Await answer.
According to the complain., instead of
sending the message as ordered it was
sent to J. G. Upright, and Mr Bride never
received it. Not having received it. Mc-
Bride alleges, he naturally knew nothing
of the family sickness and continued
about his business in ignorance of the
sickness and eventual death of his
daughter. His refusal to reply to the
message or respond to the call of the
family for assistance led to the trouble
for which he demands big damages. He
charges that in consequence of his ap
parent neglect his return home resulted
in his wife and children refusing to rec
ognize him. His wife thinks he pur
posely neglected her during their daugh
ter's illness. His domestic happiness is
thus destroyed and his reputation in
jured.

ADVERTISEMENTS.
If life were one long* summer day and its
journey through a garden of flowers, it
might be possible fforr r people to be careless
of their health without fearing evil results.
Unfortunately, since Adam and Eve were
driven from the Garden of Eden, life has
not been a toilless journey through a garden
of flowers. Man must earn bread by the
sweat of his brow, and woman must bring
forth children in pain and suffering. \
In both cases the curse is multiplied
many times over because both men and
women neglect their health. Man's toil is
rendered a thousand times harder by the
added burden of ill-health. The woman is
a still greater sufferer. She suffers in si-
lence untold agonies from weakness and
disease in a womanly way. - Motherhood
becomes to her a menace of death, and her
babes are born with the seeds of disease
already implanted in their little bodies.
There is but one unfailing remedy for wom-
en who suffer in this way. It is Dr. Pierces
Favorite Prescription. It acts directly on
the delicate and important organs that bear
the brunt of maternity. It makes them
â¢ strong, healthy, vigorous, virile and elastic.
It allays inflammation, heals ulceration,
soothes pain and tones and builds up the
tortured nerves. It fits for wifehood and
motherhood. It does away with the trials
of the period of apprehension and makes
baby's advent easy and almost painless.

merits. f'ff'yl

Â« ttr-u-_r Mat v& rÂ»__Â»ASENATORIAL BREAK
IS NOW HINGING
ON ADJOURNMENT
Indications All Point to No Election at This
Session.
DAN BURNS IS NOT A POSSIBILITY
A Majority of Republican Legislators Believe That No Sen
ator Is Better Than to Have the State Disgraced
hy the Selection of the Mexican.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, March 15.â The sentiment in
favor of an early adjournment is grow
ing stronger every hour. If the dead
lock on the Senatorship can be broken
at all it can be broken this week. It
is obvious that the break will' not come
if it comes at all until the Legislature
fixes a time for adjournment sine die.
The business of the session so far as
law-making is concerned can be fin-
ished without rushing matters by mid
night next Saturday.
The concurrent. resolution to adjourn
on next Saturday which the Asesembly
has adopted will come up on the ques
tion of concurrence in the Senate to
morrow. If the Senate concurs the
heavy work to break the deadlock will.
immediately begin.. The candidate
other than Dan Burns who comes with
in a few votes of the number necessary
for a choice will get the support of
members who believe that great sacri
fices of. individual preferences should
be made to bring about the election
of a Republican Senator.
Burns is omitted from the possibili
ties because public judgment is pro
nounced against him and for the
further reason that he is the candidate
of the Southern Pacific Railroad. At
least fifty of the Republican members
of the Legislature believe that his elec
tion would be discreditable to the State
and many cf them are firm in the belief
that the success of. Burns would dis
rupt the Republican party in Califor
nia. It is the profound and deliberate
judgment of the Republican majority
in the Legislature that no Senator
would be better than Burns as Senator.
That judgment formed early in the ses
sion grew stronger as' the contest pro
gressed. When members were in doubt
they consulted their constituents and
the response of the people was an earn
est remonstrance against the election
of Burns.
The Grant men have not yet made up
their minds whether they will oppose or
support the proposition to adjourn this
week. They will be governed, it is said,
by the outcome of the balloting to-mor
row. To-night they are claiming a
gain of ten votes. Close inquiry leads
to the belief that the claim is shadowy
nothing more than a bluff, borrowed
from the corral of Dan Burns. The
touts assert that they will not lose a
.man to-morrow and it is known that
the supporters of General Barnes held
a conference at noon to-day and re
newed their determination to stand by
their eloquent leader until the finish of
the campaign, It is believed that the
Barnes forces are firmer than ever.
One of the stories circulated to-night
by the boomers of the San Diego can
didate is that the people of Nevada
County have requested Assemblyman
Robinson to transfer his allegiance
from General Barnes to Grant. Refer
ence is made to a petition signed by
the Mayor and leading citizens of Grass
Valley urging the Assemblyman to get
in for Grant. Assemblyman Robinson
was asked to-night if there was any
truth in the report that he intended to
vote for Grant. He replied:
"I am anxious to see a Senator elect
ed and will cast my vote to brine about
that end. Present conditions do not
justify me in believing that my vote
would enhance the chances of any one
of the Senatorial candidates. There
fore I have no present intention of
withdrawing my allegiance from Gen
eral Barnes. I have before stated and
will state now that I will never vote
for Burns for Senator."
Another story going the rounds to
day is one to the effect that Assembly
man Valentine will cast his vote for
Dan Burns. Mr. Valentine was asked
for information on this topic and he
gave it as follows:
"Whoever says that I Intend to vote
for Burns tells a deliberate falsehood.
I am voting for General Barnes and
will continue voting for him. While I
have nothing to say derogatory to the
candidacy of Burns, I will say em
phatically that I will not vote for him
now or at any future time."
General Barnes* column has with
stood furious assaults during the oast
forty-eight hours from the forces of
Grant and Dan Burns. Grant's men
are moved by a desire to gain strength
immediately in order to turn the tide
their way. Burns is playing a deep
game in his effort to demoralize the
Barnes men. He is convinced that
Bulla Valentine and others from the
south' will never go to Grant. He cal

culates, therefore, that the disruption
of the Barnes camp will bring to the
Candelarian corral the southern men
who never can go to Grant.
The Senatorial campaign is not
wholly devoid of humorous features.
Judge Waymire was here for several
days endeavoring to devise some plan
of breaking the lock and electing: a
Senator. He fancied that concessions
could be brought about if the members
of the Legislature could be assembled,
not in joint convention or caucus, hut
at the banquet board. It was suggest
ed that the candidates, after dinner,
might be invited to say a few words to
the legislators that would promote
good feeling. The plan was unfolded
to General Barnes, who was not at all
enthusiastic over the suggestion, but
was willing to invite his supporters to
attend if the other aspirants, were
ready to join. Thus encouraged, Judge
Waymire went down the hall to
Grant's apartments and unfolded his
scheme. The idea of meeting General
Barnes in an after-dinner talking, con
test so surprised and bewildered Grant
that he lost his proverbial self-posses
sion and shouted: "No." The Judee
was dumfounded at the abruptness of
the refusal, and at once declared the
dinner "off." â 
Advices received from Colusa to-night
| report that Senator-elect J. W. Goad,
, who was chosen at the recent special
J election in the Eighth Senatorial Dis
trict to fill the vacancy caused by the
I death of John Boggs, will leave Colusa
for Sacramento to be sworn in as soon
as official returns* are received from
i Mendocino County. The new Senator
\ may take his seat before the present
session adjourns. Mr. Goad is a Demo
crat, but his party does not gain a
: vote by his election, as Senator Boggs
i was a Democrat.
There was a deal of comment at the
Barnes conference to-day over state
ments published in a San Francisco
paper and attributed to Senator Strat
ton. It seems that the Senator was
misquoted and made to say that he had
given up hopes of General Barnes' suc
cess. This interpretation of the inter
view caused considerable indignation
among the supporters of General
Barnes and created some joy in the
camps of Dan Burns and U. S. Grant.
To-night Senator , Stratton gave The
Call the following signed statement:
"My position with regard to General
Barnes' candidacy for the position of
United States Senator has caused some
misapprehension. I am as loyal to him
as ever and sincerely desirous of seeing
him elected. I have, however, been in
confidential communication with many
of the leaders of all of the different fac
tions other than those of Colonel Burns,
and after numerous conferences it has
been practically demonstrated to me
that there is no method or manner
whereby the opposing forces can be
consolidated for the election. of a United
States Senator. I believe that the dead
lock will continue, although it is likely
that a considerable number of votes
may change around, but if .the candi
dates adhere to their determination not
to suffer any material movement in
their forces then, of course, there can
be no election. The continuous voting
for nearly three months by legislators
for their respective candidates has so
committed them that it seems impos
sible to have a compromise. I there
fore have merely stated that it looks,
just at the present time, impossible to
have any United States Senator. This
would apply not only to General Barnes,
but to all others. It does not mean in
the slightest General Barnes' with
drawal from the contest. He is. in my
opinion, a magnificent man, and it is
with sincere regret that I perceive the
continuous determination on the part
of both Senators and Assemblymen to
make no compromise when such an
available candidate as General Barnes
is in the field. This is the situation as
I view it, but it may materially change
in the last days of the week.
"F. S. STRATTON."
False rumors are now flying around.
Among them is one to the effect that
Senator Bulla will ultimately vote for
Dan Burns. The Senator said to-night
that he had no desire to rush into print,
but authorized The Call to quote him as
saying: "I will never vote for Burns.
I have told Burns so, and he fully un
derstands it."

FREE MARKET
WILL NOT BE
HIDDEN AWAY
The Assembly Brings the Bill
Back to Its Original
Condition.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, March 15.â Goodall, Perkins &
Co.'s reported attempt to shove San Fran
cisco's free market down the water front
to an obscure location at the foot of
Front street was frustrated to-day in the
Assembly. â â  : fr'ff ...
'Senate bill 43, as It was originally in
troduced by Senator Langford, gave for
use as a free market a triangular piece
of water front property bounded by East,
Pacific and Davis streets. ;
Goodall, Perkins & Co. have, it is as
j serted, used that particular piece of prop
erty for over ten years and for all that
time have maintained a lot of unsightly
coal sheds and bunkers there. As a coal
station the block is worth thousands each
month to the steamship people, but they
i have paid to the State a rental of only
j $600 each month.
When the proposition was first made
to 'turn their coaling yards over for use
as a free market the company began a
hard fight and maintained it here in Sac
ramento through a powerful lobby.
In the Senate they were successful.
When the bill came up there a week ago
It was so amended that the pier at the
end of Front street, away off behind Tele
graph Hill, was made the location in
stead of the Davis street block.
When the bill was transmitted to the
Assembly Radeliff of Santa Cruz, who
has had the management of the measure,
offered amendments to the Senate amend
ments, which left the bill in its original
shape. His amendments were adopted
and to-day the measure came up in the
Assembly on its final passage and was
passed by a vote of 56 to 1.
Knowland of, Alameda was the mea
sure's only opponent. He said his inter
est was not personal, but that he under
stood that Goodall, Perkins & Co. had
used the property for years and had
erected valuable improvements upon it.
He thought they should not be summar
ily turned out.
â¢ Radeliff denied that Goodall, Perkins &
Co. had erected anything on the prop
erty but a lot of unsightly shanties and
one Inexpensive corrugated iron struc
ture.
"Although the free market bill was

SELF-APPOINTED LEADERS
HAVE LOST THEIR PRESTIGE
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, March 15.â fight between
the members of the San Francisco dele
gation and their self-appointed leaders.
Dibble and Johnson, was on right mer
rily to-night in the Assembly chamber,
and Dibble and Johnson had no one but
themselves to thank for it. Before a
wearying call of the House put an end to
it it was strongly Impressed upon both
of the Assembly engineers that their cus-
tomary game of bluff had been properly
called, and that an assumption of Burns'
pull and the liberal wielding of the whip
would no longer work with the "push."
Dibble started the row by bitterly op
posing a transposition on the file asked
for by E. D. Sullivan of San Francisco.
It was one of the numerous measures
designed to cut down to a reasonable ex
tent the fees of San Francisco's Public
Administrator and, for that matter, all
Public Administrators of the State. It
provides that when the heirs to an estate
in this State live in a foreign country
any one of the heirs at law may nomi
nate some one living in this country to
act as administrator.
Under the present law all such estates
fall to the easy working fingers of the
public official, and his gleanings from
that source are not the smallest that
come to him during his term in â¢ office.
Sullivan to-night asked permission to
make his bill a matter of special urgency
on the file of to-morrow. Dibble at once
objected and contended that a rule of
fered by him a day or so ago operated
against the motion in this case. The
rule was that if seven members of the
House should object to such a motion it
should not prevail. Dibble said the bill
was a bad one and Mr. Johnson said so,
too It had been before the Judiciary
Committee, they said, and three days had
been given to its consideration.
One of the chief witnesses before the
committee at the time of its considera
tion was Abe Ruef; attorney for the Pub
lic Administrator of San Francisco, and It
Was evident at the time that the commit
tee had accepted his opinion on so im
portant a matter as its own. Dibble ob
jected and called upon others in the House
to do so. He finally mustered eight and
the motion was lost. Then White of San
Francisco attempted to get another bill
forward on the file and Dibble pursued the
same tactics. Mr. Ruef's Interests were
well looked' to.
Then came Atherton's bill to make the
costs of prosecution of crimes committed
In prisons chargeable against the State
instead of against the counties in which
the prisons are situated. All through the
evening Dibble had been hurrying things
ns rapidly as the clerks could keep the
records. Delay to Dibble is not preferred
i to a week's sickness, and in this fact the
members found their opportunity to get
back.
Atherton's bill needed six more votes
than lt got to pass it and the delegation
immediately set up a howl for a call of
the House. . Then they demanded a roll
call on the question and won on that
point, although Dibble made a fight
against It. The call was finally ordered
and the doors closed. Then Dibble raised
some points of order and attempted to dic
tate the decisions of Speaker Anderson.
The Speaker declared his point was not
well taken and the gang on the other side
of the House laughed." They kept it up
for as much as half an hour and then
Atherton himself moved that the call be
suspended and it was so ordered. His
bill was finally passed.
MUCH TALK OVER
DISTRICT FAIRS
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, March 15.â With the district
fairs as a subject and the general appro
priation as a cause, the Senate wasted
most of this afternoon in talk. There
were several amendments offered, but the
bill weathered all but one â an amendment
raising the appropriation for the State
Agricultural Socle*/. By the original bill
$30,000 was allowed. Last night, after a
long discussion, this was reduced to $20,
--000, and then by an amendment to-day
was put back to $30,000.
The discussion of the bill was enlivened
by some charges by Boyce that the bill
had been rushed through second reading
with a haste that bespoke an anxiety to
avoid -an open consideration before the
Senate when there was not a full attend
ance. When the bill was considered last
night there were not many Senators pres
ent, but, as Davis said during the after
noon's discussion, if any one of the Sen
ators was absent it was his own fault.
Davis said the bill had been thoroughly
discussed and he denied that there were
any dark lantern proceedings. Then the
discussion became general, and in the
midst of it Doty moved to raise the State
Agricultural Society's appropriation from
$20,000 to $30,000. There were all kinds of
arguments advanced for or against the
amendment, and It was finally . decided
that the amendment should be adopted.
That appropriation having been dis
posed of. Boyce moved to strike out sun
dry lines in the printed bill which removed
the clause declaring forfeited any bene
fits provided by the bill if there was al
lowed upon the district fair grounds any
game of chance. The amendment was
lost. Then Laird wanted to raise four
of. the allowances for as many districts,
but this, too, was lost, as it was consid
ered a bad precedent.
It was during this discussion that Dick
inson was given his first word of praise.
As chairman of the Finance Committee
he was getting very fairly roasted by the
malcontents, and then Sims rose to say
that Dickinson had handled the affairs of
the Finance Committee in a manner that
showed I distinguished ability â¢ and he
thought the Senator.-should.be accorded
praise instead of blame and sarcasm.
Shortridge then submitted an amendment,
lumping the forty-two agricultural dis
tricts named in the bill into sixteen and
making larger appropriations for each.
This, too, was lost after Langford had
warmly supported- it. Then Langford
had an amendment of his own. He
wanted to strike from the bill all appro
priations for district fairs. At the
amounts allowed, he said, it was impos
sible to hold any fair, and the only thing
to do was to strike out the appropria
tions. His amendment was lost. That
ended the consideration of the bill for
the time being and the bill went back to
the printer to have the allowance for the
State Agricultural Society raised.
NO MONEY FOR
INJURED MILITIAMEN
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, March There will be no
claims for injuries received while in the
National Guard service allowed this ses
sion, for the Governor has just vetoed the
second one so emphatically that it is not
. probable any more will go to him.
In a message to the Senate this morning
he announced his disapproval of the claim
of William Sullivan for a gunshot wound
received during the strike of 1594. The
message of disapproval is as follows:
Executive Department, State of California,
Sacramento, March 15, I!*_ 3.
To the Senate of the State of California: I
herewith return to your honorable body with
out my approval Senate bill No. 165, with my
objections thereto.
This bill provides for the payment of $1000 to
William M. Sullivan in payment of a claim
against the State, and directs . the Controller
to draw his warrant in favor of said claimant,
and further providing that the act shall take
effect from. and after January 1, 1900.
Upon an examination of the claim, I find that
It is for personal injuries sustained by Mr.
Sullivan from the discharge of a firearm of a
soldier of the National Guard on July 4, 1894.
while Mr. Sullivan was serving as captain of
Company D, Third Infantry. N. G. C, at the
time of "the strike. From the facts before me
It clearly appears that there is no legal claim
against the State for such injuries, and to
appropriate the money named In - this bill would
be to make a gift, which Is In direct contra
vention of section 31 of article 4 of the consti
tution of the State. (See also Brown vs. Hart,
93 Cal. 328.)
While I regret the misfortune of Mr. Sulli
van, my duty compels me to disapprove of this
bill. â¢ HENRY T. GAGE, '.

This means practically the death of the
other bills of a similar nature now on the
different files awaiting action.

liver and bowels, without weakening
or irritating them, make it the ideal
laxative.
In the process of manufacturing figs

HUMANE SOCIETY
GIVES HOT ROAST
TO GOVERNOR GAGE
Executive Veto Denounced as Cruel and
Lacking in Dignity.
MORE IN SORROW THAN IN ANGER
â 
They Say They Are Mortified by the Ignorance of Law of .the
Man Who Was Elected to See That the Statutes
Should Be Faithfully Obeyed.
CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO, March 15.â following open
letter to the members of the Legislature
is from the Sacramento County Hu
mane Society and is self-explanatory:
The petition of the Sacramento Coun
ty Humane Society to the Honorable
the Assembly of the Legislature of Cal
ifornia and the Senate of the State
represents that the right of petition be
ing given to us as citizens in a duly
incorporated association under the laws
of the State, we beg to be heard by
your honorable bodies in petition
against the veto of Assembly bill No.
5 by the Governor, as sent to the As
sembly on the 9th inst., and we pray by
our petition that said bill may pass,
notwithstanding the objections of the
Governor, for these reasons:
To sustain said veto will be to con
demn all humane societies, and let the
people think that the statements of the
Governor are correct, which they are
not.
Our badge officers are not "newly cre
ated knights of the pistol and trunch
eon." They are commissioned .by the
Superior Courts only. They have been
such officers since 1874, and the bill
does not create them, or any improper
power for them. The Governor, it ap
pears, is unfamiliar with the old laws
of the State..
As to killing old, diseased, sick and
abandoned animals, the charge against
us is untrue and cruel. Such power is
in the law of 1874. We asked some
changes that experience calls for. One
is about the location of the suffering
animal; another requires all peace
officers, as well as our officers, to act
and take up and care for such aban
doned suffering animals, and if no own
er can be found, then to kill the ani
mal. But it is also required that the
officer shall care for the animals, and
if they are not in the owner's hands to
feed them, and treat them, and for the
cost a lien is given. * ''â '_â -,
We represent that there is not a word
In the bill giving power to use "force
and arms" against any one who "re
monstrates;" or telling our officers to
do anything that a good citizen should
not do if he witnesses cruelty to an
animal â is, he should interfere to
prevent It if he can, and call on by
standers to help him.
We present that the sarcastic words
of the Governor about section 21 are
cruel and beneath the dignity of his
office. That section we have found to
be a necessity after long experience. It
requires owners of certain animals to
kill them to stop cruelty, but no man
can be guilty under it until convicted
in a court, so no injury can happen to
anybody for keeping a worn out brood
ing or racing horse, because the section
says that it shall not apply to any one
who keeps an animal with proper care.
If he does not, and turns the animal out
to die uncared for he ought to be con
victed. We represent that if some words
of section 22 seem to be ridiculous,
they can do no harm, and no court
would require part of a horse to be sold.
TEACHERS' ANNUITY
BILL GETS ON WELL
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO. March 15.â teachers' an
nuity bill has passed the Senate and by
to-morrow night will be In the hands of
the Governor. Yesterday the bill was
taken up on the Assembly file and ; was
read a second time. This afternoon it
was taken up out of order for third read
ing and it passed without opposition.
The bill makes two important changes
in the annuity law now in force in this
State. By some oversight high school
teachers teaching outside of San Fran
cisco were not included among those en
titled to the benefits of the law, and one
of the purposes of the bill just
finally passed is to include every
teacher in the State who wishes
to become a member of the as
sociation. A second change was one equal
izing the amount of the annuity.' In San
Francisco teachers on the retired list
have heretofore been allowed $50 a month
and those outside of San Francisco $30 a
month. The new bill reduces the $50 in
San Francisco to $30. making the amount
the same all over the State. This was
done from motives of justice and econ
omy.
The terms of the annuity law provide
that $1 a month shall be deducted from
the salary of every teacher who wishes
to take advantage of the law and the
fund so formed is used for the payment
of the annuities.
This bill, and others relating to the
school departments, have been under the
care of Colonel Murphy and E. S. Kings
bury, teachers in ,the San Francisco
schools, and the two men selected by the
teachers of San Francisco to see that In
the mass of educational legislation which
has gone through and is pending there
was nothing that would work an injury
to the schools of the State. With the
passage of the annuity bill their labors
are nearly over, but for rive weeks both
gentlemen have been almost constantly
on the ground, and as a result there has
so far been no "bugs" passed in the edu
cational bills.
.Time Given for Argument.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, March 15.â Before vetoing the
Veterans' Home bill, which provided for
the. payment of the Government â¢ allow
ance directly to the treasurer of the
home, Governor Gage gave the subject
thorough investigation. He 'found - that
the Federal statute required the money to
be paid to the State. ,__,*,_.
The Governor has determined . that a
full hearing shall be offered in -reference
to the Santa Fe bill. AS the. Merchants'
and Traffic associations presented objec
tions to the measure it was decided that
their representatives should have oppor
tunity Friday at 9:30 a. m. to submit ar
gument. As a measure of fair play it was
also decided that the friends of the bill
should then be heard.
Newspaper Claims in Assembly.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO. March 15.â Thirty-eight of those
abbreviated newspaper '; claims , for pub
lishing constitutional amendments were
passed In the Assembly, tbis afternoon.
I But we represent that such "property"
some times consists of several animals,
part of which may be sold to pay cost
of keeping all; and sometimes we take
up animals with other property at
tached, and no owner appears, and
sometimes a part interest in an ani
mal may be sold to pay the cost of its
rescue from cruelty.
We protest to your honorable bodies
against the charge of the Governor that
we want to put a burden of $102,000 on
the people, and that we reap the benefit
of fines imposed and put the cost of
trials on the State without putting up
a dollar.
We represent that the societies have
put up ten times more of their own
money than they have received as fines,
and many cases cost the societies more
than the fines levied; that the societies
work for the benefit of the people, and
not for themselves; we protest that the
bill does not authorize us to start out
"on a pilgrimage of human slaughter,"
and that such an attack by the Gov
ernor is cruel, undignified, and loses
him the respect his office should have.
We protest that in the veto message
the Governor treats of the law as it ex
ists more than of Assembly bill No. 5,
thus exposing unfamlliarity with the
law and the bill, for, as we have said,
they were created such by law before i
the Governor became a citizen of the |
State, as he should have known, and
that the same law exists in most States i
of this country.
By this petition we represent that it
is untrue that our societies do not work
! for "the benefit of the State," but for |
their own gain; that such charge is j
| cruel and untrue; that we have for j
I years and years put up our money to ;
! enforce the State's laws and have made ,
I no gain for ourselves, and have given !
| our time as well as our money freely !
to prevent cruelty, rather than make
arrests, that our children and those of
our neighbors may not be witnesses of I
inhumanity, but be brought up to re- j
spect the rights of animals, because we j
1 know that those who are cruel to their i
i domestic animals will be cruel to their j
, fellow men. \^Sk%
We represent to your honorable bod- j
i ies that we have not, as the Governor
'. says, sought to put a burden of $102,
--j 000 on the people. Our bill asks for per
' mission for the people, if they are will
; ing, to help us meet the costs of our i
work. It does not cflmpel them to do so. I
We represent,. in petitioning you to
; pass the bill over the veto, that we are
| more mortified than angry over the ex
, posure made by the veto message of
! lack of knowledge of the law as it is
. and has been so many years, and over
the charge against our motives and
purposes, as being selfish and un
j worthy, whereas they are disinterested
! and unselfish, and we represent that we
I would be less than men if we did not
i resent for the bodies to whom such
| charges have been made, the attacks
made upon us so cruelly and unjusti-
I fiably.

PASO ROBLES, March 15.â Bank
Commissioner Barrett concluded his
labors in this county to-day and will
leave here in the morning for San Fran
cisco. The affairs of the Bank of Tem
pleton and of the Citizens' Bank of
Paso Robles were Investigated. Both
were found In excellent condition, . so
far as the interests of their depositors
are concerned. No attempt was made
to examine the Bank of Paso Robles,
as this institution is a private concern,
over which the Bank Commission has
no jurisdiction.
As the result of its suspension the
Bank of Templeton will retire from
business after it has paid all of its de
positors in full, which its stockholders !
are In a position and ready to do. Its I
condition at this time as found by j
Commissioner Barrett is as follows:

Of the amount due banks all but
about $8000 is owing to San Francisco
institutions. The book assets of the
institution were cut or "written off" by
Commissioner Barrett to the amount of
$31,800. R. W. Martinoff, an attache of
the bank, was placed in charge as the
representative of the commission.
President H. Eppinger and Cashier F.
D. Frost of the Bank of Paso Robles
are now in San Francisco, where they I
hope to secure Sufficient financial as- j
sistance to tide over their present diffi- j
culties. A. Jackson, the assistant cash- j
ier, said to-day he was confident the |
bank would reopen Its doors on Mon
day a"nd be prepared to pay every de
positor' in full and to meet every other
demand against it. Commissioner Bar-
rett is inclined to look upon the bank
suspensions in this county as a species
of "financial tempest in a teapot,"
caused primarily by unusual, unex
pected and uncontrollable natural
causes, and secondly to the existence of
too many small batiks. He added: .
"The practice of commercial banks
paying five and six per cent interest on
certificates of deposit is . unsafe and
cannot under the condition of affairs
exist without Jeopardizing the inter
ests of the banks. This is one of the
evils that the commission is constantly
coming In contact with, and it has met
with the most decided disapproval as
being unsafe. The advice is given in
all cases that this practice be discon
tinued as soon as possible."

Court gave judgment to Mrs. Flnlgan for
alimony and counsel fees, amounting to
several thousand dollars. She got :â  an exe

it was done to take advantage of the

Inflicts a Heavy Loss on the
Insurgents and Takes Many

MANILA, March 15.â Insurgents es
caping from Pasig to-day attempted to
cross our lines between San Juan del
Monte and San talon. A few volleys
from the American troops drove them
back. yf-f;
General Lloyd Wheaton, command
ing the United States flying column,
attacked and defeated a force of 2000
Filipinos at Pasig this afternoon, in
flicting a heavy loss upon them. The
American loss was slight. The Ameri
cans captured 350 Filipinos. Many
bodies of rebels killed in the engage
ment are floating down the river.

WRECKED DINGO
A SALVAGE PRIZE
Picked Up by the Steam
ship Tees.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
VICTORIA, March 15.â The steamer
Dirigo, which ran upon * the rocks on
Midway Island last Thursday, has af
ter all escaped becoming a wreck. The
steamer Tees, of this port, which ar
rived at 9:30 this evening, picked her
up on Saturday afternoon last, an hour
after she was floated, and, putting
hawsers. aboard, claimed her as a sal
vage prize. The officers on board en
deavored to make an arrangement to
get the Tees to tow her to Juneau, but
the Victoria steamer was, of course,
unable to make such an arrangement,
according to law. She is not permitted
to tow in American waters, being a
British bottom.
The position of the Dirigo, when
picked up by the Teees, was an ex
tremely dangerous one, and had the
slightest squall or disturbance of the
then placid sea arose she would with
out doubt again have been wrecked
on the reef from which she had just
escaped.
A blinding snowstorm prevailed from
long before the wreck occurred until
within an hour before she was floated,
and in'the storm two American steam
\ ers passed the wreck without seeing
her or the signals of distress she was
displaying. :â -': {
The Tees came along during a break
in the storm, and had hardly got her
lines aboard and begun to tow, when
the snow began to fall thickly again,
rendering the navigation of the reef
studded waters 'of that vicinity most
dangerous, especially for an iron ves
sel like the â¢ Tees, hampered as she
was by her consort.
The Dirigo, when taken by the Tees,
was lying about a ship's length from
the reef, where she was wrecked, and
was anchored with her hawsers run
ning across it. She was helpless, as
her engines were lifted out of place dur
ing the accident and were utterly use
less. Had she lifted her anchor, ac
cording to the officers of the Tees, she
would have become a wreck again in
an instant by drifting on other reefs
near by. Her hull was torn badly by
her. contact with the reef, but by dint
of hard work her officers and crew
managed to patch the hull with canvass
and boarding so that she could make
the voyage to Juneau, thirty-six miles
away, in safety. She is now. lying at
the Alaskan port and when patched
sufficiently will be towed down. Orders
were received by the Tees and tele
graphed this evening to Seattle, asking
that a tug be sent up for her. This lit
-1 tle service by the Tees will no doubt
result in a handsome reward in the
way of salvage; as the Dirigo and her
cargo are valuable. y vy
Officials of the Canadian Pacific Nav
igation Company will go to Seattle to
morrow to institute salvage proceed
ings against the Dirigo.
Pilot Nichols, who was on the bridge
at the time 01 the wreck, is, like Cap
tain Roberts,- a sick man. When the
Tees reached the wreck he was con
fined to his bed with a severe attack of
pneumonia. ..
; It :is believed here among insurance
men .that the. Dirigo wreck will â¢ have .
the effect of sending up Insurance rates
on vessels plying to Alaska.

NO MOVE FOR DIRECT

WASHINGTON, March 15.â At the
French Embassy it was said that no
move has been made to induce the
United States to permit direct negoti
ations by Spain with the Philippine
rebels for the release of the Spanish

CASTELLANOS INSULTS
SPANISH OFFICERS
MADRID, March 15.â An extraordi
nary speech made by General Castel
lanos, the Spanish Governor General of
Cuba, who was recently appointed Cap
tain General of Madrid, to the soldiers
during an inspection which he made of
the barracks yesterday, has caused In
tense anger in military circles. The
Captain General said:
"There is only one thing good in the
army, and it is the soldier himself. As
to the officers, if they are derelict in
their duty, I am accustomed to send
them to the galleys.'.*
i The officers have demanded that the
Minister of War take action in the mat

TRADE COMBINE
OF CYCLE MAKERS
Fifty Millions Capital
Involved.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, March 15.â The Herald
to-morrow will say: Makers of bicycles
have arranged the details of the for
mation of a trade combine that will
involve capital to the amount of $50,
--000,000. It is understood that ten of the
leading makers of wheels have entered
the combine and that several others
will probably be persuaded to add their
signatures to the agreement.
A. G. Spalding is credited with being
the moving spirit in the proposed com
bine. With him are associated A. A.
Pope and R. Philip Gormully of the
Gormully & Jeffrey Manufacturing
Company of Chicago. Attempts to form
a bicycle combine have been made in
the past, but all have been futile,, pri
marily because the small manufactur
ers could not be eliminated.
With the coming of the chainless bi
cycle, however, the situation was al
tered. While the transmission of power
by means of shaft and gearing is not a
novelty, the adoption of It to the use
of the bicycle, involving the construc
tion of complicated machinery neces
sary to turn out the gears, is said to
have cost one company five years of
labor and an expenditure of more than
$300,000. A company was formed in
New Jersey and Lyons to manufacture
bevel gear -bicycles, but under its pat
ents privileges were granted to some of
the largest concerns in the trade. It is
upon the foundation afforded by these
licensed concerns that the new organi
zation is to be founded. All the com
panies licensed. have agreed not to cut
prices under penalty of forfeiture of
license and the payment of a cash pen
alty said to be $5,000,000.
When this had been arranged A. G.
Spalding set sail for Europe. At the
time it was said he went for his health
In the course of Mr. Spalding's search
for health abroad, it is said, he obtained
in France the control of the Acetacyne
patents, which are considered to be the
foundation of the beveled gear wheel
the French having used this form of
power transmission several years be
fore it was tried elsewhere.' In England
the cross roll or geared patents were
obtained. No change in the bicycle
business for the present year is con
templated, but next year each manu
facturer's products will be marketed,
the middlemen's profits being eliminat
ed. That all this had been carefully
planned is shown by the recent organi
zation of a $5,000,000 bicycle saddle com
pany by A. L. Garford. former presi
dent of the National Cycle Board of
Trade. ' : -y

SUING TO OUST
PRESIDENT REA
Union Bank Depositors
Bring: Action.
THREE DIRECTORS OPPOSED
COUBT ASKED TO ANNUL THE
APPOINTMENTS.
Complaint Sets Forth That the New-
Officials Are Indebted
to the Defunct
Concern.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, March 15.â A petition was
filed in Judge Lorigan's - -..rt this
afternoon to oust James W. Rea, Dr.
William Simpson and George T. Dun
lap from the directorate of the Union
Savings Bank. The action is taken in
the name of Alexander Filipello, D. C.
Tabacco, J. S. Wallace, G. V. Gabliardo,
S..S. Parker and F. Garboil, depositors,
and Francis Pope, a stockholder.
Archer & Pope are the attorneys.
It is set forth that James W. Rea
is Indebted to the bank in tl i sum of
$5000 on two promissory notes, Dunlop
$900 on two notes and Simpson has two
notes aggregating $2250 against him.
The law provides directors shall not
borrow from the funds of a savings
bank and it is claimed persons in
debted to such bank cannot legally be
elected directors. Th- petitioners ask
that the appointment of Directors Rea,
Simpson and Dunlop be declared null
and void and that three competent per
sons be appointed as. directors in their
stead. Judge Lorigan set the hearing
of the petition for March 24.
The depositors now begin to realize
.there will be much delay in settling
the bank's affairs. â¢ The action taken
by C. P. Breslan in the United States
Court to enjoin the directors appointed
by Judge Lorigan means lots of time
consumed. Breslan said to-day if the
court granted his writ he would call
a meeting of stockholders at once and
elect a new board of directors.
"I only wish to see a reputable board
of directors appointed that will have
the confidence of the people. If I had
the naming of a board it would be
Amasa Eaton (president), Cyrus Jones
(vice president), J. J. Miller, J. Leiter,
G. W. Fowler, F. A. Hunter and W. H.
Wright."
He denied that he represented the
Union Trust Company. The decision
of the United States Court in the Bres
lan case will be watched with interest. -
Breslan was elected director after the
bank failure. He refused to resign
when the rest of the board resigned.
The fact that he still remained a direc
tor was ignored by Judge Lorigan and
a full board appointed.

CONSIDER BIDS
FOR THE FIGHT
Brady and Julian Meet
in New York.
THE SAN FRANCISCO OFFER
LARGEST PURSE GUARANTEED
THE PUGILISTS.
Disagreement Over Picture Privilege*
Causes a Postponement
.of the Final De
cision.
Special Dispatch to The Call
NEW YORK, March William A
! Brady, representing Jim Jeffries, and
Martin Julian, manager of Bob Fitz
| simmons, met to-day to consider the
bids made for the proposed fight be
tween these pugilists. As soon as
Brady and Julian read the $30,000 bid
of a San Francisco syndicate, through
|H. P. Taylor, it was taken up. Julian
I said that if 'any person connected with
{ the National Sporting Club of San
Francisco were connected with the new
i syndicate he would not accept any pro
posal from that body. In fact, he said,
he would rather have the bout take
place in the East, as their experience
in California in the fighting line was
not agreeable either to himself or Fitz
simmons.
Brady then asked Mr. Taylor what
he was prepared to concede for picture
privileges and the Western representa
tive replied that the purse was large
enough to cover all that. Brady ob
jected and so did Julian. Both claimed
that the picture privilege would prove
to be a large factor in the matter and
1 that no club offer will be considered
i until the participants in the bout should
I receive a percentage of the profits aris
ing from the reproduction of pictures
jof the flght. Brady. said:
"I'll give a sum equal to 75 per cent
of the net receipts of the flght for the
. privilege of taking and producing these
pictures."
Mr. Taylor then .asked for time to
communicate with the San Francisco
{ people whom he represents so that he
could find out what terms he could
offer. . - .
W. B. Gray, representing the West
chester Club, offered a purse of $21,000,
but would not concede any privileges to
the fighters, claiming that the purse
was in itself sufficient. His offer was
tabled quickly.
Then came the Coney Island Club's
representative, John P. Dunn. He said
the club was willing to put up a purse
of $20,000 and also, so far as he knew,
to divide the proceeds of the picture
privileges equally between the two con
testants and the club. He also re
quested twenty-four hours to enable
him to communicate with the manage
ment of his club. It was finally agreed
to give all . parties twenty-four hours
to make final offers.
There will be another meeting at 2
o'clock to-morrow afternoon, when it is
thought a final settlement will be ar
ranged. -_ - : .

FOURTH STREET
BRIDGE A TAX
ON SHIPPING
Shipowners and Lum
ber Men Indignant.
A BRIDGE-TENDER'S BONANZA
THAT IS WHAT OPENING THE
DRAW PROVES TO BE.
The Boarding Masters Finally Raise
Sailors" Wages â Overdue
â Baettke and the
Sloop Mabelle.
A howl of indignation is going up from
shipowners and lumber men over the
- conduct of affairs at the Fourth street
drawbridge. The city pays the keepers j
for iking after the draw from sunrise i
to sunset, but between the hours of sun- j
set and sunrise the bridge tenders are
governed by no law save their own con- j
science, and it is needless to say that
that is a very elastic affair. In fact, the \
Fourth-street bridge Is a veritable Klon- ',
dike for the bridge tender and the ship
owners and lumber merchants are the
field now being worked.
A few of the firms who have to pay toll
to the men who handle the bridge at
night are the San Francisco Lumber
Company, Union Cumber Company, Al- â 
bion' Lumber Company. Pacific Pine Lum
ber Company, J. S. Kimball Company, ;
Truckee Lumber Company and the Wil- !
aso Bros. Company. The Kimball Com- ;
pany assert that It costs them on an ay- |
arage 510. a month to have the draw- 1
bridge opened at night so that their ves
sels car. pass in and out. The others |
will pay similar amounts for a like ac- !
commodation. so it is a safe estimate to
place the earnings of the bridge tenders,
exclusive of the salary paid them by the
city, at $1000 a month. No wonder that
every ward politician in- the city is lay
ing his strings to secure the job from the
Supervisors for a favorite.
'â¢The whole matter has come to be a
crvinE evil said J. H. Bullock of the
Kftnball Company yesterday. "It costs
our firm alone SloO a month, and for that
<^urn 1 could keep the bridge attended to
every night In the week, year in and year
out The bridge tender used to have a
i'xe'd rate of ii for opening the bridge
after dark, but now they often exact *>
and occasionally Â»Â». and sometimes
ev-n more than that. On the night of
Mafch 12 the captain of the Novo had to
nay 55 and to-night (last night) we have
agreed to pay W3O to have the bridge
opened, so that the Aloha can pass
-'Thf bridge tenders have *Â»*<*Â£*

to narge. If they don't get through

When the sum exceeds *> the . tenders as
s*ri that they have to employ another
man to help them and we ha* c > to pa^
th* piper. We are not the only surterers
by" any means! and I should say that a
low estimate would place the earnings
of these men for night work at 510,000 a
Â°"For a long time we simply paid the
money and looked pleasant. Then *c
demanded a receipt tor every cent we
paid out and at first they "fused to give
us one, saying it was simply a matter or
accommodation on their part and we were
paying for a favor; furthermore, that !
there was no law to compel the opening
of the draw after sunset and they, the
bridge tenders, were putting themselves
out of the way to oblige us. We in
sisted upon getting a receipt, however,
and now we have quite a stack of them. :
Here is one we got on the 12th Inst. It
reads: 'March 12. 189?. Received $5 from I
the captain of the Novo for opening the ]
bridge on the night of the 12th at 11
o'clock.â Welsh.' : - Â
"You see we are being cinched right |
along and the sooner the Supervisors
make a change the better it will be for ;
the shipping of the port."
"The bridge-keeper got to my collar to j
the tune of $5." said Captain O. Erickson i
of the steamer Albion. "At 11 a. m. I was
ready to go to sea and asked that the
draw might be opened. The tender re
fused to open the bridge on the ground
that the tide was out and it would dam
age the concrete pillars to open the draw.
He therefore refused to open the draw
until 5:30 p. m.. when it was after hours,
and I had to pay $5 for the accommoda
tion."
The shipowners and lumber men have
combined in this matter and intend to
have this tax upon shipping done away
with or know the reason why.
Now that the rain has come and 'the
State is saved," the shipowners and
merchants who congregated on 'change
yesterday gave considerable of their time
to discussing the overdue fleet. The out
look for the British ship Dominion is con- ;
sidered bad. while the chances for the
Alcides and Carnarvon Bay are held to
be about even. The Helen N. Kimball is
not looked upon as a good risk by in
surance men and the owners of the Albert
Meyer are anxiously looking for news by
the next island steamer.
The Alcides is now out 150 days from
San Francisco for London with the most
valuable cargo that left this port in a
sailing vessel last year. It was insured
for over a quarter of a million dollars
and that fact has a good deal to do with
the amount now being paid for reinsur- j
ance. __ r'.y'-y- â '
Th* Carnarvon Bay left Tacoma for ;
Queenstown a month before the Alcides :
left San Francisco and is now out 197 ;
days. Her cargo consisted of 70.358 centals I
of wheat valued at $71,000. Strange to
say. although one vessel left a month af- ;
ter the other, both were spoken in almost
the same latitude and longitude last No
vember. On November 22 the Carnarvon
Bay was in latitude 36 south, longitude 131
west, while on November 26 the Alcides I
was in latitude 25 south, longitude 131 j
west. On the Carnarvon Bay the under- ,
writers are paying 70 per cent reinsurance,
while on the Alcides they are paying 40
per cent, In connection with these two !
overdues it is well to note that the Brit
ish ship Clan Macpherson, which left Se
attle on October 4. or thirteen days before
the Alcides and sixteen days after the
Carnarvon Bay. only reached the Tyne
(England) on the 12th inst.â days out.
From this it would seem as if there was
still hope for the vessels named.

days from Eureka for Panama. Quite a
number of vessels that left the Hawaiian I
Islands after the Dominion reached port*
long ago and it is feared that the ship i
was caught in a squall and. being in bal- ,

hope for the Helen N. Kimball is that she ,
has reached Panama and the agent has

The boarding masters have formed
1 themselves into a close corporation and in !
i the future deepwater ships will have to
i pay $30 a month for sailors. For a long
j time the ruling wage has been $20 a
. month, but since the law limiting a man's
I advance to one month's pay went into
effect the boarding masters cannot make
both ends meet. It is not so many years [
ago since $80 was the money received for ;
each sailor. Of this sum. $60 was the ;
two months' â¢ advance and $20 was the
"bone or "blood money" paid by the
captain of the ship for each man. From
$80 the wages gradually dwindled to $20
a month, with a two months' advance,
and now the advance has been cut in ;
I half, so in desperation the boarding mas- i
; ters have decided to make an effort to ,
advance wages.
The idea came from New York. The
, boarding masters of Gotham decided that :
$20 would not pay expenses, so when the I
â  ship John R. Kelly was ready to sail I
for San Francisco they asked the captain \
for the $20 advance and $10 a man "blood '
money." The captain and owners refused
point blank to pay the "blood money,'' so ;
wages were at once advanced to $30 a
month. The John R. Kelly lay in stream I
a long time without a crew, but finally
the owners gave in. a crew at $30 a month
: was shipped and the vessel is now on her
way to this port.
When the news of the victory reached
San Francisco the boarding masters held !
a conference and notified Shipping Mas
| ter Charles McCarthy that in the future j
'â  $30 a man would be the rate for deep- j
! water ships. McCarthy had a crew for ;
the Wm. H. Smith, loaded for New York,
half shipped, and he asked permission to i
I complete her crew at the old rate. This ;
I concession was made, and now the flght
I is to center over the James Drummond.
: This vessel is almost ready to sail for
London and Captain Skewes says he will
not pay $30 a month. The boarding mas
ters say he will or he will have his ship
1 tied up, and there the matter stands for
; settlement. Should the captain of the
Drummond be forced to pay $30 It will
: only be a question of a few days when
every deepwater vessel in port will be
i paying that rate.
Captain Kustel is no longer master of
the ship Hawaiian Isles. He had a mis
understanding with the owners and his
resignation was accepted.
The trouble between the American bark I
Ceylon and British ship Talus will not j
! go into the courts, but will be settled by |
; arbitration. On February 26 both vessels
i were making port when the wind fell
j light. The Talus anchored and a few j
: minutes later the two vessels came to
gether. The British ship was not dam
aged to any great extent, but the Cey
[lon was. Each captain held the other to
blame, and finally It was decided to sub
mit the matter to arbitration. Captain
H. H. Watson, the marine surveyor, will
represent the Ceylon: Captain Metcalf,
Lloyd's agent, is to look after the inter
ests of the Talus, and Matthew Turner
will be the referee.
J. Lee Palmer. L. M. Nichols and James
Shaw returned from Santa Cruz by train
yesterday and tell an interesting story of
their rough voyage in the Mabell*. The
party started out for th* Farallones Sat
urday morning with a light breeze. When
lust outside the wind stiffened and at
daylight Captain Baettke put out his sea
anchor and the battle with wind and
waves began. The rest of the story, as
told by members of the party, is as fol-
I lows:
By Sunday morning the wind had increased
almost to a hurricane, and as a precaution the
captain made an> extra sea anchor of the fly
ing Jib. the anchor and boat hook, which was
placed in readiness to put out at a moment's
notice, and a wise precaution it proved, for at
3 o'clock Monday morning away went the line j
that held the drag we had, out. and In a mo- ,
ment we were in the trough of the sea with
the seas going clear over us. : . Â»..
The able seamanship of the captain and his
two associates enabled them to get out the
improvised anchor before much damage was
done and hold her up in the wind again. But
the wind and sea were too much for her to
stand and at 6 o'clock Monday morning she
parted the 3H-'-T" line on the drag and we
were again at the mercy of the sea. We had
nothing left to nut out to hold; delay meant
certain death, and In a flash the jib and reefed
mainsail were up and we were scudding be- j
fore a raging sea at a ten-knot clip. Santa j
Cruz was the only port we could head for be
fore the wind and we arrived there about 2 ]
o'clock in the afternoon, having made the" run |
from the Farallones to Santa Cruz ln less than I
eight hours. Captain Baettke remains at Santa I
Cruz with the Mabelle and will sail her back I
to San Francisco as soon as the storm is over.
FAILED TO IDENTIFY HIM.
Charge of Extortion Against Clay
Markell and Frank Mason, Ex-
Convict. Dismissed.
The preliminary examination of Clay
Markell and Frank Mason, the latter an
ex-convict, on the charge of extortion,
was held before Judge Mogan yesterday,
and as there was no evidence against the
defendants the case was dismissed.
Early in January Gustave Schwarz of
the Old Louvre went to the ferry in re
sponse to a telephone message and was
met by three men who handed to him
valuable papers that had been stolen
from the safe in the Old Louvre. For
these Schwarz handed them $10). One of
the men had a revolver and Intimidated
Schwarz to prevent him from calling as
sistance. That afternoon Schwarz noti
fied the police, and on returning to the
saloon was warned over the telephone
that he would be killed if he informed
against the extortionists. When Markell
and Mason were arrested by Detectives
Gibson, Wren and McMahon, Schwarz re
ceived another telephone message, warn
ing him not to identify the men on pain
of death. Â«^;-Â»yy ~
Both Schwarz and his bartender. John
Dorr, who followed him to the ferry, tes
tified in court yesterday that they could
not Identify the defendants, although
Dorr told the detectives after the de
fendants were arrested that he had iden
tified them in the City Prison. The Judge
had to dismiss the case.
Mason is now waiting his trial in the
Superior Court on a charge of burglary.
On his preliminary examination on that
charge he made a desperate attempt to
escape from Judge Mogan's courtroom.
PLUMBER THURSIE ! KILLED.
Crushed "o Death by a Barrel of
Whiting Weighing Five Hun
dred Pounds.
Carl Alfred Thursie, a plumber, died
last Thursday evening at his residence,
139 Center place, from injuries received
last Saturday in a most peculiar accident.
He was working in a whiting factory at
347 Brannan street, and just before the
accident was engaged in moving barrels
of whiting on. skids. While handling a
barrel weighing 500 pounds he slipped and
the barrel began to roll off. Thursie, in
stead of jumping out of the way, seized
hold of the barrel in order to stop it. He,
however, failed to recover his balance
and the barrel rolled over him, Inflicting
fatal injuries.

GLORIFIES THE HOLY BOOK
A BRILLIANT DISCOURSE IN ITS
DEFENSE.
Undeterred by the Storm a Large
Crowd Attends the Benefit fcr
Old St. Mary's
Church.
Despite the storm last evening, the lec
ture deliverd by the Rev. P. J. MacCorry,
C. S. P., in St. Mary's Church, drew a
large attendance. The hundreds who
braved the Inclement weather were repaid
by listening to an eloquent sermon and
some grand music.
Preceding the lecture the following num
bers were rendered: (1) Gloria from
Mozart's "Twelfth Mass," by the choir;
(2) "Aye Maria" (Mascagnij, contralto
solo. Miss Josephine Murphy, with violin
obligato by Eugene L. Schmitz; (3>
trombone and violin duet, "Prayer"
(Francis), trombone Alfred Roncovieri,
violin E. Schmttz.
At tho conclusion of the music Father
MacCorry discoursed for nearly an hour,
entertaining his listeners with his elo
quence. "The Armor of God's Word
was the subject of his address. It was a
logical defense of the Bible and was re
plete with pathos and humor and drew
tears and smiles from his auditors. In
part he said:
There is an infinitude of pathos in the his
tory of books. Like men and women, they live
and love and have their being, only to descend
like the waters Into the earth and return no
more. Books, like men. get out of date.- When
they were written they discussed issues that
were then being discussed. They struck at
wrongs that have ceased to exist. They advo
cated principles which are no longer living
principles. Were they books of history, other
books have risen up to take their places, the
subject matter better classified and more vivid
ly portrayed. Were they books of poetry, they
were interlocked with wild mythologies which
have long since gone up from the earth like
mists at sunrise. Were they books of morals,
they have passed away for civilization will not
long content Itself crouched at the reet of the
pagan morality.
Since the days of Pythagoras and Sappho ani
Tully we have moved outward and upward and
on. The pathos of Slmonldes, the sarcasm of
Menander. the wit of Aristophanes are no
longer a part of the lives we live. Books are,
therefore, very human. They are born, they
are fondled, they grow to vigor, they have a
midlife of strength and usefulness, their sun's
full orb. Then comes their declining yearsâ old
age, decrepitude. Imbecility. They totter, they
fall, they die "back to the earth like the waters
that return no more."
Many of our libraries are merely cemeteries
of dead books. Every shelf a vault, every cover
a casket. Some of them live wild, tumultuous
lives and die wild. ignominious deaths. Some
were virtuous and accomplished a glorious mis
sion. Some were martyrs and went up in the
ashes of persecution's flames. Some, like the
literature of Alexandria, found their funeral
pyre in plundered cjti"^ Some were neglected
and died abandoned foundlings at the door of
science. Some expired in the author's studio.
Pome departed on the cylinders of the press.
Oh the vast cemetery of our buried books. I
think every night when the world sleeps. Poetry
and Prose. Science and Religion, go out hand
and hand to that graveyard and consecrate Its
myriad mounds with the sympathy of their
tears.
Or. shall we rather say that the soul of all
good books still livesâ lmpressed, epitomized
between the covers of one grand old book, the
Bible? That, after all, ls the fountain head
from which all books worth the reading have
received their life. Every great book that has
been written since books were made derived
its power and pathos from the armory of God's
word Spencer imitates the parables: Tasso
paraphrases the Scriptures; Bunyan reproduces
the apocalyptic vision of St. John; Macaulay
crowns his most tremendous climaxes with a
quotation from Scripture; Carlyle is a parody
on Ez*kiel. and wandering up and down the
avenues and by-paths of Bible study you can
find the counterpart of all the world's painters,
poets and rhetoricians. They went to this foun
tain of truthfulness, grass-banked, crystal
lined Its surface reflecting back the garniture
of earth and the glory of constellations, and
derived their life.
The speaker then showed in detail how
the Bible started in the world's infancy,
grew beneath theocracy and monarchy:
how it was guarded under prophet's man
tle and fisherman's coat: how it spread
across the earth, traversed the lakes,
forded the rivers and navigated the seas;
churches, convents and asylums gather
ing along it? way and stretching out their j
hands in benediction.
The Scriptures were shown to be au
thentic; that they were written by the men
whose names they bear: that in spite of j
wrath and of tyranny and oppression they
have come down to us not a syllable al- i
tered, not a paragraph changed, not a j
promise lost; that although Voltaire came
out with his "acute philosophy, Hume with
his subtle scholarship. Gibbon with his
lopsided history, Hobbs with his insidious j
malice, Paine with his blasphemous i
chuckle, the Scriptures stand unimpaired,
and that all these have gone down to
death, defeated men, throwing their life
blood In execration to the skies and
shrieking with their dying breath. "O
Galilean, thou hast conquered." The very
style in which the Word of God is written
was cited as an excellent proof of its j
divine origin. How the thoughts flam. j
out. how they fire the blood like the roll i
of a war drum, how they flash upon the I
brain, how they thrill the sensibility.

WAILING OF THE TOUTS.
WHEN the people of San Francisco decided they
would no longer, endure the iniquity of de
generate racing the Supervisors were not slow
to catch the drift of sentiment. Hence it was that the
Ingleside track was forced either to become the scene
of honest speed contests or to close. It will no longer
be permitted to thrive on the contributions of dupes,
upon money stolen by employes, or yielded by the
deluded toiler inspired by the hope of winning and
believing in the good faith of the racetrack promoters.
Under some conditions racing may be legitimate
sport. Under the conditions which have prevailed
here racing is a fraud and a snare.
That the law now forbids betting on races is a cir
cumstance which has provoked lament, but this all
comes from the touts, the hangers-on or the mani
pulators. The louder their wail the more conclusive
the evidence that the Supervisors have done wisely
and well. No objection comes from the reputable
citizen, none from the head of a family, not a word
of protest from the business man, who was never,
certain that his trusted employe would not be led
into temptation. In the estopping of betting a great
good has been accomplished.
As the days pass this fact becomes emphasized.
The people who are glad that the Supervisors have
taken so radical a course are the best citizens of the
community. The people who object constitute the
riff-raff, heretofore thriving on unearned money, and
many of them not even citizens of California. They
have flocked here like buzzards, and now that their
opportunity for preying has passed they are at lib
erty to go away, and they never will be missed.
The wail of the touts is vociferous, but it falls upon
the ears rather pleasingly. They were expected to
wail.
A GOOD APPOINTMENT.
\,\ EX of all parties will approve the action of j
/ \ Governor Gage in appointing Senator !
* * Stephen M. White to the office of Regent of j
the university. The selection is an excellent one in '
every respect. It is in no sense a partisan reward, I
since Senator White is not only a Democrat, but j
was one of the most active of his party in the cam- j
paign against Governor Gage in the last campaign.
It gives the southern part of the State a strong repre- |
tentative on the university board, and is thus as satis- j
factory from geographical as from political considera- j
tions.
While the Governor could have readily found a j
man in his own party and a resident of this section i
of the State well fitted to perform the duties imposed
upon the regents of the university, it is, none the less
gratifying that he made the choice he did, for such
appointments should be free not only from political
bias, but from even the suspicion of it.
None will question the fitness of the selection made.
Senator White is one of the few political leaders
cf the State who rank as statesmen and have the es
teem of the whole people without respect to party
lines. His abilities are of the first order, and his
patriotic regard for the welfare of the State and of
its institutions is undoubted. Himself a man of
learning and culture, he will be in full sympathy with
the work to which he has been called, and can be
counted on to labor faithfully for the accomplishment
of all its great educational objects.
Already there is an intimation that by an unwritten
law the Vice-President of the United States is cut
off from renomination. This Government is not con
trolled by law of the unwritten kind. That Vice-
Presidents are not renominated may result from their
ambition to escape from obscurity. â¢ â¢
â¢ f
â¢ The millions sent to Cuban soldiers represent
a gift, nothing more. If they have the bad taste to \
object to the size of it they have only to become as
the "Man With the Hoe," and Markham will write
deathless verse about them, while they hustle for
rations.
Just because a woman in a Paris theater cried
"Fire!" a panic arose. Several people had their
stomachs trampled upon, but nobody was killed. The
calmness and self-possession of the French when
there is an emergency is the wonder of the world.

the worst of it, but they do not seem able to learn
anything.

Cubans may go to war with the United States, but

BRYON YifS fi LUCID INTERVAL.
A LETTER by William Jennings Bryan written
in November, 1897, but just made public, shows
the champion of free silver has occasionally a
lucid interval, during which he sees things as they
are and is capable of forming a reasonable judgment
concerning them. The letter is, therefore,. more in
teresting than his usual utterances, and its statements
are as applicable to conditions now as to those which
prevailed when it was written.
Mr. Bryan's correspondent desires to have the
Democratic party make in its national platform for
1900 a declaration in favor of the Government owner-
I ship of railways, and, writing to that gentleman, ex
pressed the hope that he would be renominated for
the Presidency in 1900 and would make the proposed
plank a feature of the campaign.
To all that Mr. Bryan responded that he has never
examined the subject of governmental management
of railways and has formed no opinion on it; he is
opposed to the introduction of a new issue into poli
tics because the people can deal with only one reform
at a time, and other questions have precedence of the
one proposed; and finally he says: "I think 1900 is
too far away for us to know who may be most avail
able at that time. We are entitled to the most avail
able man whoever he may be, and the events of the
next three years will be needed to aid us in selecting
him."
There can be no question of the soundness of these
statements. One issue at a time is all that can be
effectually settled in a Presidential election. Even
when two or more issues are before the country, as
in 1896, when tariff reform, currency reform and the
; remonetization of silver were all at stake, the people
' cast their ballots with reference to one only. Many
free-trade Democrats voted for McKinley and the
gold standard, while a considerable number of Re
publicans who were stanch protectionists voted for
Bryan and free silver. So it will always be. One
issue dominates the campaign and the rest are vir
tually ignored.
When Bryan wrote the letter he doubtless thought
the free-silver agitation could be kept up and made
the salient feature of the 1900 campaign. If such a
programme succeeded he would inevitably be the
candidate of his party for the Presidency. If ever
another lucid interval comes to him he will perceive
that these hopes have no longer any reason to support
them. Whatever may be the subject of party conflict
in the coming campaign it will not be the remoneti
zation of silver.
Only a short time ago Mr. Wall of Wisconsin, a
member of the Democratic National Committee,
wrote a letter to Chairman Jones declaring he can no
longer support the free-silver doctrine. The reply of
the chairman has not been made public, nor is it
necessary that it should be. In all parts of the
country the former zealots for silver are falling away
from the standard and deserting the cause. A new
issue will engage the minds of the American people,
and to meet it Democracy must find a new leader or
suffer an even more disastrous defeat than that of 1896.
Nobody at this stage of scientific development can
yet dispute the claim of the physician who asserts that
he has found a serum competent to defy pneumonia.
The race is hardly subject to a malady more fearful
than this, and if it can be banished the society organ

have something tangible upon which to base its hopes
and its prospectus.
"MUST EXERT THEMSELVES."
IN a conversation with the New York correspondent
. of The Call Mrs. Stanford stated that she has
\ noted among the Eastern people whom she has
met a much greater interest in California than on
any previous visit. This is due of course to the grow
ing importance of Pacific Ocean commerce and to
the general recognition of the advantage California
will have in profiting by it.
Mrs. Stanford, however, is not one of the believers
in manifest destiny who hold that the trade will come
to us whether we exert ourselves or not. "Califor
nians," she said, "must not assume for an instant that
this avalanche of trade will sweep toward them of its
own accord. They must exert themselves and co
quette a little with our foreign friends. Californians
now have a golden opportunity. It remains with
them to take advantage of it, and make the Golden
State the empire State of the Pacific."
These statements are the results of impressions ob
tained from conversations with the great capitalists
of the East. They are in accord with reports that
have come to us from all sources for some time past.
The East has an oversupply of money. Capitalists
are seeking investments. The possibilities of Pacific
Ocean trade have attracted sufficient attention to lead
men to talk of it, but as yet no considerable amount
of American money is flowing into it. Whether it
comes or not depends upon ourselves.
In the meantime the Southern States, having by two
expositions made known the extent of their re
sources, are drawing to themselves large amounts of
Northern capital, and are rapidly building up a manu
facturing industry of vast proportions. Those States
have nothing like the commercial and industrial pos
sibilities of the Pacific Coast, and yet are progressing
while we are comparatively stagnant.
The time has come for the Pacific Coast to make an
exposition on a scale of sufficient magnitude to at
tract the attention of the world and turn in this di
rection a large part of that accumulation of capital
which is already perplexing Eastern financiers and
which will be increased by the course of foreign trade
during the coming season. Mrs. Stanford has spoken
wisely and timely on the subject. ; Californians must
exert themselves.
A strange story comes from Nashville- that while
colored troops were returning from the front their
sleeping cars were invaded by the police and the
somnolent troopers beaten into insensibility. With
out the slightest prejudice against these troops, who,
according to all accounts, fought nobly, nobody will
believe the story.
A NEW PENAL LAW.
AMONG the many creditable things done by the
present Legislature is the passage of a bill add
ing two new sections to the Penal Code, under
which hereafter it will be dangerous for candidates
for the Federal Senate to "assist" members of the
Legislature before their election.
The sections referred to are numbered 63 and 6354.
The first provides that every Senatorial candidate who
shall give or- loan a member of the Legislature any
money or property in advance of his election, whether
under promise to vote for such candidate or not, shall
be guilty of a felony. The rule thus laid down ap
plies also to an agent, and upon proof that a Sena
torial candidate has advanced money personally, or
"through an agent, or that it has been advanced in his
behalf, renders â  a conviction possible. The second
section makes members of the Legislature who accept
the money equally guilty, and evidence that the money
has been accepted is prima facie proof that the legis
THE SAN- FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, MARCH 16, 1899.
lator has promised to vote for the Senatorial candi
date, or, in other words, accepted a bribe.
The custom of "assisting" candidates for the Legis
lature during campaigns in return for support after
ward has been a favored plan of securing the toga in
this State. Several- distinguished gentlemen whose
names we could give have resorted to it without
scruple, maintaining that while not entirely free from
objection, it was perfectly legitimate and proper.
These amendments to the Penal Code, however,
will put an end to the practice; that is, unless the
"sack" candidates are willing to take the chances of
exposure and the penitentiary. Ordinarily Colonel
Mazuma is not overbold. He prefers to transact
business amid the confusion of a political campaign
with individuals widely separated rather than appear
in the lobby at Sacramento with a bag under his
waistcoat, where the reporters can interview him and
supervise his work. Perhaps it never will be possible
to entirely eliminate money from Senatorial politics
so long as the Legislature is invested with power to
elect, but these sections will go a long way toward
confining that potent influence within proper bounds.
IT is reported from the City Hall that, for the first
time in the history of the city, the Municipal Re
portsa very interesting volume over which
Clerk Russell exercises personal supervision will be
bound in two volumes instead of one. This is said
to be the result of verbosity among the heads of the
various departments of the city government, who,
instead of reducing their annual reports to constituent
particles, have swelled them out with a view to ad
vertising their work or for the purpose of making
their offices appear important in the municipal gov
ernment.
It is hinted also by the reporter who records this
prospect in the columns of a morning contemporary
that another cause for the extraordinary enlargement
of this branch of municipal literature is a desire on
the part of officials to give the printer of the volumes
as much work as possible. A desire to multiply the
work of printers and consume appropriations, how
ever, is not by any means confined to the publica
tion of the Municipal Reports. A sentiment of lib
erality and extravagance in disbursing the public
money permeates the entire city government. When
appropriations are for any reason inadequate, or have
been skimped to conform to a limit on taxation, it
runs riot everywhere, finding expression in grumbling
and kicking on the part of the officials thus forced to
economize. Indeed, such a thing as business
economy or a desire to reduce expenses is rarely or
never found among either elected or appointed public
servants.
But there ought, nevertheless, to be some way by
which to confine the Municipal Reports to one vol
ume. Not only will two volumes add to the confu
sion of reference, but they will take up more space
upon the shelves of the libraries compelled to harbor
them than is justified by the subject of which they
treat. Why cannot Clerk Russell undertake the work
of condensation? Certainly the reports could well
stand a liberal application of the shears. During late
years many of the longest reports have been aban
doned. Take, for instance, the report of the Regis
trar of Voters, one of the most important of the bi
ennials. It used to be the practice to print his elec
tion figures in the Municipal Reports. Now he is
compelled to publish them in a pamphlet.
Why cannot the same thing be done with the
swollen out statement of the Auditor and the long
drawn statistics of the Superintendent of Streets?
What readers of the Municipal Reports want for the
most part is the necessary records of government
â the bones after they have been picked, as it were.
If there is any advertising to be done the officials
should do it on the dead walls or in the newspapers.
THE OUTLOOK IN SAN LUIS.
REPORTS from San Luis Obispo are to the
effect that the financial flurry caused by the re
cent bank failures has virtually died out, and
that there are now no indications of further trouble.
It is to be hoped the report is not based upon a too
sanguine view of the situation, and that with the
coming of the rain the people of that section will
share in the general prosperity of the State.
There are indeed good reasons for believing that
the banks suspended in that "darkest hour which pre
cedes the dawn," and that had they been able to hold
en for a short time longer all would have gone well
with tnem. The spring rains have started in with a
profusion sufficient to give promise of good crops for
farmers and good pasturage for cattlemen. That
means immediate relief from the anxieties and fears
that disturb business and the probability of complete
relief later on from financial stringency by bringing
into the county abundant revenues when the crops go
to market.
In addition to the rains there is promise for San
Luis Obispo as well as for all the coast counties from
Monterey to Los Angeles in the statement of Mr.
Huntington that the work of closing the gap in the
coast railroad would be begun at once and be pushed
forward with such vigor as to make it probable the
road will be open within a year.
The opening of the road will make that route the
chief thoroughfare of travel between San Francisco
and the south, and as a result will aid in bringing
about a general development of the resources of the
section. With an increase of population there will
come an opportunity for son* of the residents who are
now land poor to sell their estates in small tracts and
thereby build up such communities as have made so
many other sections of the State prosperous and com
paratively wealthy.
A financial agent in Denver advocates the lynching
of an editor there because of the paper's opposition

editor a fresh text and renewed ardor.

The above are the names of the jurors
who, yesterday, after a brief deliberation,
returned into court and rendered a ver
dict of murder in the second degree
against Mrs. Dora Fuhrig, the notorious
midwife and performer of criminal opera
tions. To this verdict there is due the
support of the entire community, for it
has condemned the acts of this notorious
woman as second only in criminal vicious
ness to the deliberate, malicious assassin
ation of a human being.
The verdict, if the Supreme Court does
not see fit to reverse it and send the case
back for a new trial, will be the means
of ridding the community of the most
dangerous of this class of criminalsâ
most dangerous foe in addition to the
inclination to perform such crimes as the
one for which she will, in all probability,
serve a long term in prison, there is
coupled profound ignorance, and this ig
norance makes her as dangerous to a
community as the plague. Death has fol
lowed in her wake constantly and if the
doors of a prison are now to be closed
upon her it will be generally considered
well and that the jury did but its duty.
The crime for which Mrs. Fuhrig has
suffered conviction Is that of causing the
death of Mrs. Anna W. YValmsley by
means of a criminal operation, performed
in a cruel, bungling manner. It is man.-'
fest from the testimony introduced in the
case that she had no interest in the
young wife whose death she caused ex
cept the few dollars she might reap if the
the operation was successful. Itisofttimes
necessary that this operation be per
formed for the relief of disease. An at
tempt was made to prove that such was
the condition in the present case, but
the proof failed, and there remained but
the agonizing picture of a young woman,
in the bloom of health but with an aver
sion for children and a love of pleasure.
Placing her life In the hands of a con
scienceless midwife, whose ignorance and
criminal inclination sacrificed her rather

to an illy gotten purse.
.. As _?ell as to the verdict of the jury
Â£n e c Â£ orts Â°, f District Attorney Murphy
co n^m h en S da a bfe Stant ' Attorney Black ' are
Several weeks ago Mrs. Fuhrig was
tried and acquitted of the charge against
her of having caused the death of Mrs
vSt E ,ffh ton A few da >' after this
-verdict the husband of this victim, ag
onized over the loss Â° his life, took his
full* eff e e bt an o d not tv then that the
run effect of this woman's crimes was
appreciated by the community. After
this occurrence District Attorney Murphy
< 0 4 k ,, lh . c Prosecution in hand, and, as
sisted by Mr. Black, bent all efforts to
ct C tV, r Â» e ~ con â vic "on. All one afternoon a
ann , h -5 s ! d between the prosecution
and the defense as to whether the dying
statement of the prisoner's victim should
be read to the jury, and when Judj.e
Cook finally decided to admit it it was
Known that Mrs. Fuhrig's conviction was
as , . i : < _ d - Â°J}, the ruling of Judge Cook
admitting this statement as evidence it
is said that the defense will rest for a
reversal of the verdict. District Attor
ney Murphy, however, says that the right
of the jury to hear this statement is sus
tained by many decisions, and in conse
quence he is confident that the verdict
will stand and that Mrs. Fuiirig will go
to Slate's Prison for a term of not less
than ten years and perhaps for life.
Judge Robert Ferral, who represented
Mrs. Fuhrig, made a hard fight to secure
his client's acquittal, but the case against
her was too conclusive. It is seldom that
Judge Ferral casts logic aside and at
tempts to play upon the sympathy of the
jury, but in this case he did. He en
deavored to lead the jury to the opinion
that in the event Mrs. Fuhrig was con
victed the world would be deprived of a
breadwinner and homes would be sad
dened thereby, but in answer to this
Judge Murphy pointed to the homes that
had been ruined through her nefarious
calling and the homes that might be be
reft of a mother or a wife if she con
tinued plying her criminal trade. He did
not deny that she was a breadwinner, he
said, but he questioned her right to fill
grave after grave with young and prom
ising wives in her battle for existence.
When Judge Murphy closed his argu
ment the jury was instructed and retired
to deliberate on a verdict. In twenty
minutes it returned, the foreman an
nounced the verdict, "murder in the sec
ond degree," and recommended the con
vict to the mercy of the court. Mrs. Fuh
rig evinced no emotion, but tears filled
the eyes of many of the women in the
court, whether from gratitude over the
conviction or sorrow for the convicted is
not known. As soon as matters had
quieted down to some extent Judge Cook
set Saturday for sentence and the crowd
filed out. Mrs. Fuhrig was immediately
taken to Branch County Jail No. 3 to
await sentence.
"I consider the conviction of Mrs.
Fuhrig a victory," said Judge Murphy.
"The crime for which Mrs. Fuhrig must
pay the penalty is becoming fearfully
prevalent in this city and must be
stopped. It is a crime second to none in
the category of crimes, and those who
commit it are as depraved as he who way
lays and murders for the gold in his vic
tim's pocket. Twenty years ago I con
victed Mrs. Hodgdon, and for a time her
kind were afraid to practice their calling,
but again they became fearless. This
conviction, besides ridding the community
of this dangerous woman, will have its
moral effect as well, and who can say
the number of young women that, this
verdict will save from the graveâ women
who would have taken this step had not
its dangers and the darkness of the tomb
been made known to them through the
trial and conviction of this woman, the
most notorious of her class.
"As an authority upon which I base
my statement that this crime is becom
ing fearfully prevalent, outside my own
knowledge, I can refer to the work of
Horatio P.. Storer, M. D., LL.B., who
says: 'We are compelled to acknowledge
not merely that criminal operations are
of alarming frequency among us, but that
its frequency is rapidly increasing, this
having been made apparent by each link
In the chain of evidence that has been
presented. Every effort that might pos
sibly check this flood of guilt, if de
layed, has so much the more to ac
complish. The crime is fast becoming, if
it has not already become, an estab
lished custom/less honored in the breach
than in the observance.' s"or these rea
sons I am gratified that a conviction was
had, and to sustain this conviction I will
devote all my energies." .

RAIN IMPROVES
REALTY MARKET
VERY RAPIDLY
Investments Getting
Scarce Downtown.
LARGE LOANS BEING MADE
BEAL ESTATE MEN ABE HOPE
FUL OVEB THE OUTLOOK.
â  ..f^' .'â :. fi yYYy V-
The General Bain Has Caused a Be
vival of Business and at Pres
ent Good Country Property
Is in Demand.
The real estate men were a happy lot
yesterday. It was plain that they were
receiving as much immediate benefit from
the rain as the country. There was but
one opinion among them and that was
that the prospects of California were
never better. It is evident that they hope
for a decided revival in business as a re
sult of the rain. The realty market for
the past few weeks has been steady, and
In fact it has been improving. This fact,
coupled with the coming of the rain,
makes them all the more jubilant.
A. M. Speck said that there was plenty
of money to be had, and in fact that it
was never easier. This, he argues, is
a good sign. Good investments down town
are getting very scarce, which shows that
money is being placed in real estate.
Large loans are being made at 6 per cent,
and besides a number of mortgages have
been lifted. These facts show that money
is plentiful. Speck & Co. have a large
number of sales on which they hope to
consummate within the next few weeks.
They report that the corner of O'Farrell
and Mason streets is soon to be improved
by a modern seven-story building. The
sale of the old Cambrian Dancing Hall on
Mission near Seventh street, for $23,000,
is also reported.
Thomas Magee & Sons also report some
small sales during the past week, and
they have in hand the consummation of
quite a number of others. Mr. Magee
is very hopeful over the outlook and is
of the opinion that the realty business
will take on a great activity in the near
future as a result of the rain. Madison
& Burke also report the market as hav
ing been firm and improving. Burnham
& Marsh Company have a number of
sales on hand for next week, and they
look for a decided improvement in the
realty business. Center & Spader say
that the market has been unchanged but
steady. They also have in view a num
ber of sales and are hopeful of a great
and immediate Improvement in their
business.
Never has the demand for country prop
erty been better, and this fact is taken
as a favorable sign. In a way the de
mand for out-of-town realty is taken as
an indication of the financial pulse of the
country, and judging from the present ac
tivity there is every reason to believe
that the prospect is bright and promis-
iner

EXTENDING SIXTH STREET.
Opening of a New Thoroughfare
From North to South San
Francisco.
The cutting down of Irish Hill, south
of the Union Iron Works, upon which site
the Scotts will build additional structures
for the enlargement of their ship-building
plant, has been the means of extending
Sixth street. The grading of the ground
tor the proposed new buildings was done
by the Potrero Land and Development
Company, and at the same time this com
pany obtained the contract for the exten
sion of Sixth .street from Channel bridge
to Kentucky street.
The work is now completed on both
contracts and the teamsters and others
whose business takes them to and from
the Potrero and South San Francisco will
have an additional roadway direct from
the center of the city to the Union Iron
Works, sugar refinery and other manufac
turing industries on that side of the Mis
sion channel without being compelled to
get there by the way of the Fourth street
bridge. ' '
This new roadway will be hailed with
delight by those whose business lies in
this direction because of the unpleasant
ness of being compelled frequently to wait
for several minutes at the drawbridge
while lumber and hay schooners are go
ing from the outer into the inner bay
through the drawbridge. This, together
with the obstacles at the railroad cross
ings at Fourth and Townsend streets, has
almost been sufficient to make the Fourth
street route useless. The new street will
therefore, become the principal driveway
between the two sections of the city It
will require, however, about one year for
the newly made ground to become suffi
ciently settled before it can be paved In
the meantime it will be open for travel by
the Ist of April. '

THE RULES OF CASINOâ City. In
the game of casino a player may not alter
his build; that is, if A and B are playing,
A plays a five, placing it on a four, he
calls it nine, and If B does not take it up
he is not allowed to add an ace to his
build and call it ten, but he may, before
taking that up, make another build; say,
place his ace on an eight and call that
nine, or he may play a card or take sev
eral cards by combination, but he must
comply with one of these conditions or
take up his first build. If the player has
built up a card, and has in his hand more
than one card of the same denomination
as his build, and his opponent leaves the
build undisturbed, the player may play one
Of these cards upon the cards constituting
the build at the same time repeating his
announcement of the denomination of the
build, and the card so played is equiva
lent to a call. This may be done a sec
ond time before taking up the build. That
is to say, A has three fours and an ace
in his hand, and there is a three on the
table. A may play his ace on the three and
make it four; if it remains undisturbed he
may play a four from his hand on the
build and call it fours, not four; if that Is
not taken, he may play another four on
the build and still call it fours before tak
ing up the build. Each of the fours bo
played on a build has all the immunities
of a call. ."- .v- y.y

Inebriate Has Two Women Arrested
for Robbing Him and Wili Be
Punished for Contempt.
R. A. Molloy. a blacksmith living at the
St. George lodging house. Sl2 Kearny
street, raised a tremendous row early
yesterday morning by charging two wo
men, also living in the house, with rob
bing him of a purse containing $17. He
locked the women in a room and went
in search of a policeman. He met Po
liceman Cavanaugh and demanded that
he should go to the house and arrest the
women. As he was considerably under the
Influence of liquor, Cavanaugh began to
question him and was threatened with the
loss of his star.
Cavanaugh finally arrested the two wo
men and Molloy accompanied them to the
California street station. There he re
lented toward one of the women * who is
a cook and supports herself and six-year
old child, and she was sent home, but a
charge of grand larceny was preferred
against the other, who gave her .me as
Lizzie White. _, , ,
The case was called in Judge Conlan s
court yesterday and Molloy refused to
prosecute, as he had found the purse and
the money in his own room. He was so
drunk that he thought he had been
robbed and called in the policeman.
The Judge severely lectured Molloy for
his conduct, and said he was guilty of
trifling with the police and the court. He
had two innocent women arrested and
taken to prison because he was drunk
and thought he had been robbed. H.
would make an example of him and or
dered him into custody for contempt of
court. He will learn his fate this mora,

CONCRETE INSTEAD OF TILES
Government Decides Upon a Flooring
for Federal Buildings.
The efforts of the Manufacturers' and
Producers' Association to have changes
made in the plans for the new Federal
building so that local manufacturers of
hollow tiling may Md upon the contracts
have brought a reply from Washington.
! On the Sth inst. . dispatch was sent to
; Congressman Loud asking him to see
Supervising Architect Taylor with a view
: of making alterations in the plans, which
call for concrete flooring throughout the
i building. Yesterday President Sbarboro
received a letter from Mr. Loud, includ
, ing one from Mr. Taylor, which practical
!ly settles the matter. Mr. Taylor says,
â  under date of the Sth Inst., that after due
1 consideration it was decided to use the
i concrete system of flooring; that the iron-
I work and tie rods had been placed to con
j form with such method and would not
! accommodate satisfactorily terra-cotta
j floor arches.
I Notwithstanding the chilling effect of
I this letter, the officers of the association
: are determined that the hollow tile to
; dustry shall be recognized by the Govern
: ment in future public buildings, several
â of which are to be constructed before
i long. Manager Goodwin yesterday said:
i "In the hope that this local industry may
j receive proper recognition in the prepa
; ration of specifications for the new public
buildings at Oakland, Stockton and else
where in the State, the- Manufacturers'
and Producers' elation has forward
ed an argument in favor of hollow tiling
to the Supervising Architect of the Treas
ury."

A CELEBRATION FOR CHARITY
Proceeds of St. Patrick's Day Cele-
bration Go to Youths' Directory.
St. Patrick's day will be celebrated in
this city not by gorgeous parades and
sumptuous banquets, but by two grand
entertainments for the purposes of char
ity. The convention of Irish-American
societies of San Francisco have arranged
the first to be held at the Tivoli Opera
House in the afternoon, and the second
will occur at the Mechanics' Pavilion in
the evening.
At the Tivoli performance Sir Julius
Benedict's romantic Irish opera, "The
Lily of Kiliarney." will be presented in
addition to a limited programme of liter
ary- exercises. The evening entertain
ment will begin at . o'clock and a flne
bill has been prepared.
The proceeds will be devoted to ths
Youths' Directory. During the past year
its treasury has been depleted in accom
gy.g its charitable work, and it is
oped that to-morrow's entertainment
will enjoy a liberal patronage.
Six hundred youths, who were homeless
and some of them more or less inclined
to evil, have beÂ«n set on the straight
paths of life by the reverend fathers in
charge of the directory, and its commend
able efforts are known to every citizen
of San Francisco. The homeless waifs
are given shelter regardless of creed or
color, and efforts in their behalf have
been in nearly all cases successful.

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, MARCH 16, 1899.
OFFICER HERLIHY
SAYS MR. ADAMS
BOUGHT POISON
Saw Her Tear Label
From a Bottle.
IDENTIFICATION IS POSITIVE
: EVIDENCE AGAINST THE AL
LEGED MURDERESS.
; Policeman's Statement Is Partially
Corroborated by Drug Clerk
George Purlenky â Purchaser
Gives a Fictitious Name.
Officer John P. Herlihy of the O'Faxrell
street station is prepared to swear that
he saw Mrs. Minnie Adams stand on the
corner of Geary and Devisadero streets, in
front of Â£*~>orge W. Loehr's drugstore,
Sunday _..Â«_ht and tear the label from a
bottle of carbolic acid which she had
just purchased. The officer's statement,
; which is corroborated in part by George
! Purlenky, the drug clerk, who sold the
poison, will go far toward convincing a
jury that the woman held as a prisoner
\in the City Prison murdered her two
j year-old son by fore:-.? the deadly fluid
; down its throat, notwithstanding her posi
i tive statement that she was not out of the
i house all day Sunday. Herlihy was
i standing on the corner at 8:45 p. m.. when
1 a woman came out of the drugstore with
I a small package in her hand. She
j passed within a foot of him and stopped
on the curbstone to wait for a Geary
street car. There was no car in sight,
; and after nervously glancing up and
down the street the woman hurriedly un
wrapped the package and tore the label
, from the bottle, throwing the little scraps
' of paper into the gutter.
The attention of the officer was at
tracted to the woman by her peculiar ac
tions and as she _*ood in the full glare
of the li-rht from the store for several
minutes before her car appeared he had
ample opportunity to note her appear
ance As Herlihy stood in the shadow of
the building the woman did not see him
â  until just before she stepped aboard the
car Herlihy then proceeded to pick up
; the' scraps of paper trom the gutter. The
firet one his hand came in contact with
had the word "Poison" printed in big
time across its face. He took the scraps
taw theâ¢ tore and asked the clerk what
the man had purchased. Purlenky
'aid shf had bought a three-ounce bottle
of Â»Wen? l you Â£ h d ad better keen these .pieces
of paper?' irked the officer.- 'They
may come in handy, as I would not be
prised if that woman committed sui
cide from the way she acted.
; The label is a bright red and reads as
j follows:
! CARBOLIC ACID. poISO X. CAUTION!

When Herlihy read the account of the
murdlr of the child and the arrest of its
S-other Tuesday his thoughts reverted to
the incident of the night before, and when
he reported off duty in the evening he
imparted his suspicions to Sergeant Har
per The latter notified Detective Gra
i film and Sergeant Duke, who have been
i de 4Â«tfrdÂ°a y morning Herlihy and Purlen
:kv visited the City Prison / or the pur
! Jose of identifying MÂ«. Adams as the
woman who purchased the poison, ber
' geant Duke warned them to be careful as ,
a woman's life was at stake, and then
said he proposed to bring several wtoen
before them in order that the identifica
tion, if made at all. might be positive
â¢ Mrs Adams was the first woman called
! obit and as soon as Herlihy got a good
I look at her he' said:
"You need not bring out any more, tnis
Is the woman I saw.'
"Didn't you see me at the corner of
- Geary and Devisadero streets Sunday
night" hp added, addressing the woman.
"No- I was not out of the house Sunday
'< night,' and I never saw you before," re
: plied Mrs. Adams positively.
"I guess you did, remarked the officer,
I as the woman was led back to her cell.
! Purlenky said that while Mrs. Adams
' looked very much like the- woman who
! Â§ urchased the carbolic acid he could not
c positive that she was the one.
"Women often come into the store for
carbolic acid," he explained, "and I did
not take particular notice of her appear
ance. She did not act nervously and
when I asked her what she wanted the
poison for she said she wanted to use it
as a douche. She gave her name and
address as Mrs. Creighton, 325 Point Lo
bos avenue."
There is a vacant lot at that address,
and there is no party named Creighton
living anywhere in that vicinity. Officer
Herlihy says that when he saw the
woman in front of the drug store she
was dressed exactly as was Mrs. Adams
at the time of her arrest, with the one
exception that she then wore a black
cape of some woolly material trimmed
with fur, instead of a black jacket. De
tective Graham and Sergeant Duke have
as yet been unable to find the cape, al
though the garment is recognized as an
; Important piece of evidence.
George Tyrrell. Mrs. Adam's eldest
L brother, says he left the house on Parkec
avenue a few minutes before 8 o'clock |
Sunday night. His sister was at home :
at that time. John Tyrrell, a younger j
brother, also says his sister was at home
when he retired for the night, "about" an
hour later. The father of the woman
was unable to say whether his daughter
was in the house all the evening or not.
The more the police have to do with the
Tyrrells the less confidence they place in
their statements. They are well pleased
with the progress thus far made in the
case, and believe they will eventually
succeed in proving the woman guilty of
the brutal murder of her offspring.
The conductors and gripmen of every
car that passed the corner of Geary and
Devisadero streets from 8:35 to 8:53 on
Sunday night have been questioned as to
whether they could identify the woman
who boarded a car at that place at 8:45
o'clock. They all declared they could not
recollect, so the police will not be able
to make use of them as witnesses as de
sired. The men interviewed are:
Conductorsâ W. H. Wallace. A. M. Cu!
len. M. Herrington. T. Wiessand. W. S.
Rahr and F. Peterson. Gripmenâ l.
Rumbel. Jacobson, E. F. Brown. C. S.
Roles, F. Stanley and A. F. Nelson.
The funeral of the little victim of the
tragedy was held yesterday from the un
dertaker's parlors to which the remains
had been removed from the Morgue. Wil
son Gray, the child's father and the
mother's accuser, was the sole mourner.
Mrs. Adams appeared to feel hurt last
night because she had not been allowed
to attend the funeral, but the police de
clare she never expressed a desire to see
her child from the time she was placed
behind the bars.
Mrs. Adams was caught talking to her
brother. Harrison Tyrrell, through a
crack in the partition at the City Prison
Tuesday night, and as a result she was
removed to a cell in the woman's ward
where it will be impossible for her to
communicate with him.
Owing to the fact that Coroner Hill will
not return to the city until this after
noon the inquest has been posponed until
to-morrow morning at 10 o'clock.
Drowned in the Bay.
Richard A. Fitzgerald, father of John
PriQcipal Witnesses Against Mrs. Adams, Accused
of Murdering Her Child.
Fitzgerald, who was drowned in the bay â¢
a short time ago, having fallen therein
from the steamer Morgan City, filed suit
yesterday against the Risdon Iron and
Locomotive Works to recover 125.000 dam
ages for the death of the deceased. It
is contended that the deceased was em
ployed by the defendant corporation re
pairing the vessel; that he was compelled
to work until late in the evening, and
that when he went to leave the steamer
there were no lights to guide him to the ,
gang plank. In consequence he lost his
bearings, fell overboard and was i
drowned. The Coroner's jury returned a
verdict finding that death was due to ac- .
cident caused by the negligence of the
defendant corporation for hot providing
lights. Hence the suit.

MERCHANTS
DISCUSS THE
SANTA FE BILL
Hear Arguments For
and Against.
THEY REACH NO CONCLUSION
DISCUSSION WILL BE RESUMED
AGAIN THIS MORNING.
A Delegation Headed by Mayor Phe
lan Will Visit the Capital City
and Will Appear Before
Governor Gage. ,
The executive committee of the anti
funding committee, which sprang Into
existence when the late Adolph Sutro was
waging war against C. P. Huntington, met
yesterday afternoon in the office of Mayor
Phelan.
The object of the meeting was to discuss
the Santa Fe bill, which has passed both
houses of the Legislature and needs but
the signature of Governor Gage to become
a law. The Chief Executive designated
Friday morning as the time at which he
would hear arguments for and against the
measure. The Merchants* Association
and the Traffic Association have each filed
objections to the bill and it is to have
these thoroughly gone into that the Gov
ernor has decided to give the parties at
interest a hearing. It is held by those
favoring the bill that the objections
originally raised by the various associa
tions were in the original bill and not as
it was amended before it was finally
passed.
At the meeting yesterday the opposition
to the bill was conducted by Attorney
Francis Pope, who represented John T.
Doyle, the implacable foe of the railroad.
Mayor Phelan presided and among others
present were: Hugh Craig, president of
the Chamber of Commerce: G. K. Fitch,
C. A. Murdoch. Attorney Murphy, J. R.
Freur.d. Attorney E. F. Preston, Mr. Pay
son and W. A. Blssell. Mr. Pope in his
argument held that the Santa Fe was be
ing made a catspaw by the Southern Pa
cific and that eventually the latter cor
poration would become a purchaser of the
Valley road, which is the bone of conten
tion.
Mr. Preston, who bore the brunt of the
defense, read from Supreme Court de
cisions and claimed that this State was
fifty years behind the times. He said
other States encouraged the capitalists to
build roads and spend money, while this
State apparently threw a damper on all
enterprise. The movement of the Santa
Fe and the object of the bill was to effect
a consolidation of fragments of railroads,
as far as this State can. to make a great
transcontinental road and give the people
of this coast a competing road. The Santa
Fe has a Federal franchise, but seeks a
State one, as without it. Mr. Preston
stated, It had no right to collect tolls.
The committee reached no conclusion in
the matter before it and adjourned until
11 a. m. to-day- -when argument will be re
sumed. It was determined to ask Gov
ernor Gage to postpone his hearing of the
matter until Saturday afternoon. This
will permit of the delegation from this
city going to the capital on Saturday
morning. __^_____^__

DR. KILMER'S REMEDIES.
Parsnip Complexion.
A majority of the ills afflicting people
I to-day can be traced to kidney trouble.
j It pervades all classes of society, in all
| climates, regardless of age, sex or con-
dition.
The sallow, colorless-looking people
you often meet are afflicted with "kid-
ney complexion." Their Scidneys are
turning to a parsnip color, so is their
complexion.' They may suffer from in-
digestion, j bloating, sleeplessness, uric
acid, gravel, dropsy, rheumatism, ca-
tarrh of the bladder, or irregular heart.
You may depend upon it, the cause is
weak, unhealthy kidneys.
Women as well as men are made mis-
erable with kidney and bladder trouble
and both need the same remedy. Dr,
Kilmer's Swamp-Root, the great kid*
ney, liver and bladder remedy, will
build up and strengthen weak and un-
healthy kidneys, purify the diseased,
kidney-poisoned blood, clear the com-
plexion and soon help the sufferer to
better health.
The mild and the extraordinary ef-
fect of Swamp-Root is soon realized.
It stands the highest for its wonderful
cures of the most distressing cases,
such as weak kidneys, catarrh of the
bladder, gravel, rheumatism and
Bright's Disease, which is the worst
form of kidney trouble. It is sold by
druggists, in fifty-cent and dollar sizes.
You may have a sample bottle by mall
free, also pamphlet telling all about It.

THE HAY MARKET.
The circular of Somen & Co., under date of
the 14th. says of Hay:
"The long expected movement with Hay has
come at last, and, as we have expressed our
selves previously, a start seemed to be all
that was required to Improve prices very ma
terially. Stocks in town have been running
down for some little time past, for almost
every one has been looking for a further de
cline in prices, and have therefore been some- j
what anxious to clean out so as to be prepared j
to stock up again at lower figures. No further j
decline could be noted, and as receipts con
tinue to run rather light one dealer after an
other was forced to go on to the market to
purchase to supply his trade. This demand, j
coupled with the continued dry weather, created
somewhat of a stir about Friday of last week.
and as soon as any activity could be noted on
the market one dealer after another became an
active bidder^sn the market.
"Until to-day crop prospects have been very
' againg. and prices have been steadily
advancing. As we write it Is raining and the
wind seems to be in the right direction for a
continuous downpour. In proof of our state
ment, which we have often expressed, that the
San Francisco Hay market is not a weather
market, we would state that to-day at our
reerular auction held in the rain. $18 75 was bid
for choice Wheat Hay on several carloads,
there being but nine carloads in all, total re
ceipts for the day.
"Reports have come to us that many of the |
dealers have been canvassing the country quite
thoroughly In their efforts to make purchases,
which tends to prove that they have confidence
in the future of the market. According to re
ports that We have received, stocks are becom
ing depleted throughout the State, which fact
is due more to home consumption than the de
mands of the San Francisco market. A dry
spring will increase the demand throughout
the country which will leave less Hay to be
shipped here, In which event we may look for
higher prices than the existing range, unless
Oregon. Washington and other States have an |
oversupply which they can ship here. This idea i
of foreign Hay shipments is a matter of con- j
siderable uncertainty at the present time. From
reports received to date and from prospects as
they appear to us. we are inclined to believe
that the present range of prices will at least
be maintained, if it does not advance still
further."

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, March 15.â The changes in
stock prices to May were mixed, with losses
prevailing. For thl greater part of the day
stocks were under pressure, in part due to the
strength in the call money market, where 5
per cent was recorded for some loans, although
most of the business was at 4 per cent.
London, while trading both ways, disposed
of more stock than It took. The selling of Man
hattan was attributed to the underwriting syn
dicate of the issue of new stock, although
there was no means of ascertaining the real
source. The stock closed with a loss of nearly
2 points after an earlier extreme decline of 3%.
Kansas City. Pittsburg and Gulf left off 4
points down in anticipation of a possible heavy
assessment in the plan of reorganization. Amer
ican Steel and Wire dropped 3%. with a smaller
sympathetic recession In Federal Steel issues.
There were fractional recessions, too, in North
ern Pacific. Atchison, the Readings and the
grangers. Chicago Terminal stocks were bene
fited by talk of a contract with Chicago and
Alton, while Colorado Southern was up on ru
mors of negotiations with Union Pacific. Amer
ican Tobacco r.**e 2 points, but Continental To
bacco, now dealt in in the unlisted department,
made, compared with the opening, a net loss
of 1% for the common and 3 for the preferred.
New York Air Brake jumped 10% points. Con
flicting rumors regarding the probability of the
success of certain legislation lent feverishness
to Consolidated Gas, which, however, rose %.
Metropolitan Street Railway, People's Gas and
Sugar gave some evidence of strength. A
slight recession in the strength of call money,
although it closed with transactions at 3% l Jr4
per cent, induced some covering in the after
noon. The closing tone was uncertain, with
prices below the best and above the worst.
The Government trade statistics, showing an
excess of exports of nearly $34,000,000, was not
altogether favorably received, because of the
Imports exceeding any since March a year ago,
while the exports showed a shrinkage of over
20 per cent compared with any of the preced
ing four months.
To-day's bond market, while irregular,
showed a yielding tendency. Total sales, $2,550,
--000.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET,
CHICAGO, March Complete summaries
of the amount of winter killed wheat in sev
eral States showed apparently very little war
rant for the sensational damage reports with
which the trade has recently been flooded and
caused the wheat market to open at a decline
of %Â®%c. At the decline several shorts saw a
convenient opportunity to cover and price j ad
vanced slowly to 70% c. At this point," (how
ever, news was received from California of
the thorough breaking of the drought in that
State. That started the bears selling on a
large scale and increased the weakness with
which trading commenced. Reports of an im
provement In the export demand at the sea
board caused a rally near the end and May
hesitating at 69%Â®69%c. rose slowly to C9%c.
The strength did not last long, however, It
was a weak market entirely, with the bulls
relying on the damage prospect. The price
soon slipped off to 69% c, closing at 69%Â®69%c.
Corn- not appear to have any clear no

the course of wheat for the most part. Near

Oats ruled weak and lower in sympathy with
the other grains. There was a fair general
trade. May closed %c lower.
Provisions ruled steady, notwithstanding a
sharp break in the price of hogs. The lat

that the weakness at the yards does not nave
much influence on provisions futures as packers
are selling their output for cash. May pork
closed unchanged; May lard and May ribs

THE RAISIN MARKET.
NEW YORK, March 15.â Journal of
Commerce says: Telegraphic reports that
raisin growers and packers have come to an
understanding with regard to the handling of
next season's crop have not as yet received
positive confirmation. According to some of the
larger commission merchants here, while the
basis of operations may have been established
by the association, unless co-operation was
secured of some Of the larger outside packing
concerns, which up to a late date had positively
declined to go Into the combination, the suc
cess of the growers' association was uncertain.
Trade here is awaiting fuller reports. In the
meantime there seems to be a better feeling in
the spot market for loose Muscatel raisins and
rather more demand from consumers, though
sales are almost entirely of small lots. We
heard to-day of a sale of a car of two-crown
standard at 4 cents. No further business in
Pacifies was reported. California London layers
are dull. There are sellers at $1. but buyers'
views do not seem to be above 85 to 90 cents.
It Is generally believed that rather a large
stock of these goods, for which there is little
or no consuming demand, will be stemmed and
eventually disposed of as loose. Clusters are
not wanted and prices are nominal. Valencia
layers are dull. Sultanas receive little atten
tion, but holders do not seem to be Inclined to
make further concessions.

TH*] STOCK MARKET.
Mining stocks were rather firmer, but dull.
Local securities were unusually quiet and
prices showed no change worthy of note.
The delinquent assessment sale of the Jus
tice Mining Company will be held to-day.
The report for the month from the Alaska-
Mexican mine shows 13,905 tons ore milled,
yielding $25,922, or $1 85 per ton. Sulphurets
saved, 275 tons, of which 123 tons were shipped
to the smelter at Tacoma. Expenses, $23,062.
Sulphurets expected to average $30 per ton. The
Alaska United mine reports 12,829 tons ore
milled, with $27,422, or $2 13 per ton. Sulphurets
saved, 332 tons, of which 12S tons were sent to
Tacoma for smelting, worth about $30 per ton.
Expenses for the month, $24,274. Hereafter it
is probable that all the Alaska sulphurets from
Douglas Island will be treated at the smelter
in Tacoma, which has recently been purchased
and enlarged by parties interested in these
mines.
The letter from the Justice mine states that
during the past week, on the 370 level, upraise

1600 pounds of ore, the car samples averagelng

ple gold $12 40. sliver $12 69, total $25 09 per ton,
from the upraise from the south drift on the
490 level..

TRIUMPH IN "BOHEME"
IT "WAS like the opening all over
again at the opera last nlÂ«ht. with
the difference that the opera. "La
Boheme," with Melba and De Lus
san in the cast and Seppilli at the
baton, was marvelously sung, acted
and played. The crowd was gay and
glittering and filled the big opera houso
to the last seat and overflowed into the
aisles, doorways and corners. Stout
men' and matrons sardined in cracks
and crevices where even the slim would
usually scorn to squeeze. Carriages
congested for several blocks on Mission
street. The applause inside the great
auditorium made the very roof rattle.
It was a big night. When the season
is over it will doubtless be remembered
is the biggest night of all.
Puccini's "La Boheme" was the
opera, and all glory be to Mcl I for
being the first great songstress to real
ize and exploit this remarkable work!
Her success in the part of Mimi was
overwhelming, and this success means
much to th- young Italian eomooser.
It advertises his work to the whole
musical world, and will help him to
taste the sweets of fame while he still
lives. Mascagni and Leoncavallo came
into their own at a jump. Puccini is
not without honor in his own country.
ENTRANCE OF MIMI (MELBA) IN THE STUDIO SCENE,
but it is only in the last couple of
years that his mUsic has attained to
myth like an international reputa
tion. Even to-day in many '- the cap
itals of Europe he is spoken of merely
as one of the foremost of the younger
Italian musicians. But give him a hear
ing with a company and an orchestra
and a leader like those of last night
and Puccini can speak for himself so
that there will be no difficulty in recog
nizing him as the finest Italian after
Verdi.
Puccini brings Italy up to the present
tense. By writing in the modern idiom
and uniting the saccharine notions of
the earlier Italy with the sterner
drarnaisms of modern Germany he has
struck on an ideal scheme for lyric
drama. He has Indeed done more than
any other modern to make- "Italian
opera" something better than a term of
reproach. And again I say all praise
to IfettM for giving Puccini's master-
piece the .benefit of a complete, au
thoratative performance.
"La Boheme" is not new to San Fran
cisco. We are, in truth, its pioneer ap
preciates among -English speaking
peoples. The little Dei Conte band of
Italian singers gave us almost a dozen
performances of the "Boheme" during
the winter of '97, and whatever the
shortcomings of these singers in an ex
tended repertory', they went about their
work in this opera lovingly and under
standing^ and we learned to place it
at Its true value.
The entire scheme of the piece is
fragrant, delicate and symmetrical. It
is, you might say, an opera without an
effort. The dear old Bohemian sketches
of Murger have been fashioned into a
sufficient, if not brilliant, book, and
each episode and each character is

skillfully sketched In the music. The
strings and woodwind are given full
sway In the orchestration, the brass is
used but frugally and the percussion
instruments hardly at all. Delicacy and
suggestion are the watchwords. The
old Italian mode of aria, duo, trio and
quartet are done away with. The
songs and the concerted numbers spring
out of the action of the play, which la
always sustained by both singers and
orchestra. Every character is given a
positive musical identity, and the
"motives" are introduced and reintro
duced with almost Wagnerian effect.
There is a splendid blend of the pas
sionate, the pathetic, the brilliant and
the comic. Puccini runs the gamut of
the emotions. In the first act, where
the four musketeers of Bohemia are
pitted one against the other, the very
orchestration smarts with epigrams.
Even in that wonderful death scene In
the last act there is a potent touch of
semi-comic relief. How different this
death scene of M. mi's is to the frilled
pathos of Violetta's pulmonary decease
in "Traviata!" And that quartet which
closes the third act, where Mimi and
Rodolphe are singing a tender, ro
mantic duet as they are about to part
and Musette and Marcello join them in
' the sharp music of a quarrel episode â
j it Is a prodigious contrapuntal accom
i plishment;
And as it was sung last night it
; fairly lifted the audience out of its
J chairs. Eleven times was the curtain
j rung up at the close of this act. At the
| eighth time Sepelli was led in between
i Melba and De Lussan and the cheers
| and handclapping and boot thunder
! became deafening. "Bis! Bis! Bis!"
i shouted the â¢ European element. "En
| core! Encore! Encore!" yelled the na
. tives. But the next three "curtains"
were taken by Melba and Pandolfini
and Melba alone, and the quartet was
not repeated. De Lussan had made a
tremendous impression in the role of
Musette, which has its best opportuni
! ties in this act, and during the entr'acte
; gossip ran rife in the lobby and the old
j story of professional jealousy was
| bandied about again. "De Lussan."
wagged the wicked tongues, "has. been
indiscreet enough to do too well."
Of course you and I who care noth
\ ing about the private emotions of stage
; folk will take little stock and little in
terest in such gossip. Still the fact re
mains that De Lussan did make a
mighty hit and the audience did intend
! a share of those shouts for her. It was
| De Lussan's first appearance, too. you
: know. Well, she does Carmen to-mor
row night with the center of the stage
all to herself, and if her Carmen lives
up to the promise in her Musette you
will see some warm applause safely de
livered. . 'yyy.
Melba's Mimi was really ideal from
every standpoint, except perhaps that
' of physique, for she Is a rather sturdy
picture of Murger's delicate heroine.
Her singing and her acting were per
] feet. There was a note of pathos in
that voice of hers that I never have
i heard before. In the big love scene
I with ! Rudolfo and in the death scene
! she evoked the silent tear as well as
I the noisy hand.* Her conception of the
character was subtle and refined. - In
: this most modern part she used the
best of modern craftsmanship, never
; obtruding the operatic personality of
; the prima donna, never overdoing. It
would not be difficult for the wrong
woman to make Mimi out to be the
very lachrymose,, maudlin jade that
' Puccini and his librettist have con
: spired so carefully to avoid. Melba at
i tacked the part with sympathy and
j with moderation. She made us feel the
; powers of repression and suggestion,
' and got the full vocal and dramatic
effect without once resorting to the
; atric excess. Mimi must be counted
: among her greatest achievements, as
splendid indeed as is her Marguerite.
De Lussan is of that type that I can
describe only as the Carmen type. She
is full of high spirits, devilment and
surprise; her voice is rich and of a
beautiful breadth, and there is a half
diabolic streak in It that is irresistible.
And she can act. Her humor is unerr
ing. In the cafe scene she carried
everything before her, and in the quar
rel with Marcello in the act following
her display of temper was something
delicious. I will wager that De Lus
san's Carmen strikes sparks.
Rudolfo was satisfactory but not re

markable In the hands of Pandolflnl.
This tenor acts thÂ« part better than
Agostinl did in the Del Conte produc
tion, but he has not Agostlnl's peculiar
boyish, reed-llks voice that found such
perfect vent in Rudolfo's music It
wouldn't be a bad idea for Mr. Ellis to
look up Agostinl before presenting the
"Boheme" to New York. Not that Pan
dolflnl is bad in the part, nor that Agos

any other part; but by one of those
freaks of vocal fortune Agostinl has
perhaps the best voice (if he hasn't
hacked it to pieces by this time singing
impossible roles) in the world for Ru
dolfo.
â¢ The Bohemians were all well cared
for. Bensaude made a vividly impetu
ous character of Marcello. Boudour
eque was a humorous Colline, although
his "Farewell to the Coat" In the last
act was altogether too profound, and
Zane again substituted the still indis
posed De Vries, who was to have been
the Schaunard. There was not a dis
aster in the entire cast, which from end
to end was well nigh perfect. And the
performance as a whole was deal. The
stage pictures were elaborate and beau
tiful and the stage management fault
less. Seppilli led with nothing short
of inspiration. His handling of the
great orchestra and the chorus in the
cafe act was of itself a triumph. How
he did bring out the leap and sizz and
mock swagger in the comedy moments!
And in the romantic and tragic episodes
he was equally fortunate.'
Where so much of the orchestra is
given to the strings and reeds an over
anxious leader could easily suggest
licentiousness where none is intended.
Seppilli worked with a versatility of
moods, giving color, fun. sensuousness
and tranquillity where they were due
and never losing his poise.
I dislike to be forever making sugges
tions to people who think they know
their own business better than I do, but
I do think that a first-rate concert pro
gramme played by Seppiili and this
New York symphony orchestra would
be about as nice a thing as could hap
pen to the town' on a Sunday night.

Track Notes.
But flvo races are down for decision on
to-day's programme.
While being galloped by an exercise boy
at the track yesterday morning Tammany
Hall II ran out at the stretch turn and,
colliding with tha outside fence, tore a
hole in his side as large as a water
bucket The veterinary called to attend
the sprinter's injuries said it was doubtful
if he would survive.

BRANDES' SON
TESTIFIES FOR
HIS FATHER
He Is Star Witness
for Defendant.
TELLS A STRAIGHT STORY
HOT STOVE WAS SEARCHED
FOR MISSING MONEY.
Ten-Year-Old Brother of th* Alleged
Murdered Girl Says the Ac
/ cused Never Beat
Her. yy'
Oakland Offlce San â¢ Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, March 15.
Milton Alfred Brandes proved a re
markably clever witness for the defense
to-day in the murder trinJ of his father,
AVilliam A. Brandes. The boy is be
tween 10 and 11- years of age. He has
had only about three years of schooling,
and his story as told on the witness
stand to-day was plausible -and coherent
and the strongest testimony that the de
fense has thus far produced.
The boy stated that he was at his
father's home on the night of Tuesday,
November 15 last, when the accused is
alleged to have beaten Lillian. He said
that his father had not laid a hand upon
the girl, and that he had not scolded her
or used abusive language.
"Papa scolded me, though," continued
Young Brarjdes Testifies for His Father.
the boy, "because I had tattled on my t
sister.- I had told him that Lillian had i
taken the $15 which was rent money and j
which was to be used to pay her fare j
back to the ranch. He said he would i
choke me if I ever tattled on her again. I
"Then we all hunted for the money. We
-searched in the kitchen, the dining room, ;
the chiffonier, the clothes closet and the j
'bathroom; and also in Lillian's trunk, |
which was in the dining room. We took
all the things out of the trunk and did
not find the money. Then we put the
i things back again and papa drew the
trunk downstairs to Lillian's room.
When we were hunting in the bathroom
the door kept swinging and it kept bump
ing against father." ,V
This story the boy told in a straight
forward manner on direct examination.
District Attorney Allen then took wit
ness in hand and rigidly cross-examined
him. The child denied that he heard his
sister' say on that Tuesday night. "Oh.
Al, please don't"; or that his father had
Bald he would choke her to death. .
"Lillian pleaded with papa not to send
her back to the ranch, because she said
her aunt always beat her and made her ;
work for the Chinaman. When Lillian j
could not remember where she put the
money, papa said: 'She must be a witch
to hide a thing and not know where she
put it.' I told papa about half an hour
after we had been hunting that Lillian j
told me she had hid the money.
"No we did not search Lillian room,
but we looked in the stove. i thought
It might be in there. We took the lid
off and stirred up the ashes, but dtdn t
find the money. This was about 6 o clock
and we had dinner about 5;30."
Juror Seiben here asked the witness
whether the money had ever been found.
Attorney Sawyer, for the defense, vigor
ously objected, but before a ruling could
be had Milton replied that the $15 had
been found a day or two before Lillian s
death He testified also that while the
search was in progress Mrs Godfrey was
In the parlor with his mother a.nd that
at intervals they played the piano. He
said he had talked with no one about the
case: only his father had told him to tell
the truth He steadfastly denied ever
having had any conversation with De
tective Herbert in the presence of ex-
Deputy Sheriff White in which he said
he "did not know anything Of the trou
ble, because he was asleep.
Mrs Brandes was not put on the stand
to-day. â¢ She had been in . the court
room in readiness, but was excluded dur
ing the examination of her son, Milton,
which occupied the entire afternoon.
When the trial was resumed this morn
ing the defense first recalled Dr. A. H.
Pratt by whom they wished to prove that
the absence of a ligature mark on the
neck in the region of the "Adam apple
Is consistent with ante-mortem hanging.
Dr. Crowley had declined to answer this,
out after a considerable wrangle. Dr.
Pratt said such a fact was found in cases
of ante-mortem hanging, though he
could not explain the reason.
A. H. liraunllch also testified this morn
ing He had known Brandes for eighteen
years. . Though in his judgment the ac
' cused was rough in manner and speech,
he always considered him "big-hearted."
On one occasion, said witness, Mrs.
Brandes and Lillian had been searching in
the latter' 3 trunk and when the mother
found a bottle she had said: "My God,
what do you think? Lillian has got a bot
tle of poison." . ,' 'i.
â¢ On cross-examination Braunlich said he
first knew Brandes while working in the
Baldwin Hotel. On one occasion he visit
ed him at his home on Golden Gate ave
nue, San Francisco, when Brandes intro
duced him to Mrs. Brandes. .
Objections to questions as to when
Brandes married this woman and as to
what name Brandes went by at that time
were sustained. Witness was also asked
whether Brandes had not once been a
â¢witness in his behalf in a divorce suit and
whether he (Braunlich) was not the
former husband of Mrs. May Godfrey, but
Attorney Sawyer's objections to these
questions were sustained.
The trial will be resumed to-morrow
morning and again it is given out that
Mrs. Brandes will then testify.

lucky coup of $6,000,000 in six
weeks will be in next. Sunday's Call.
SAN LEANDRO
MUST REWARD
HER FIREMEN
The Fire Company Is
Dissatisfied.
PLAIN STATEMENT ISSUED
|
TOWN IS TOO BIG TO EXPECT
CHARITY WORK.
After Paying Dues and Initiation for
Twenty-Pour Years the Volun
teers Expect Better
Encouragement.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, March 15.
San* I.eandro may soon be without an
organized fire company. For twenty-four
years Union Hose Company No. 1 has
been in existence and has done excellent
work whenever its services were needed.
It has saved the city thousands of dollars,
but now that San Leandro is growing and
a large cannery is being built in addition
to a big fruit-drying establishment it is
thought to be proper that there should be
a Fire Department under the control of
the Board of Trustees.
For all these years the firemen have
paid an initiation fee and monthly dues to
support their organization. A record
shows that they have extinguished forty
nine fires and saved much property. They
have responded to fire calls at all hours
of the day and night, and on one occasion
six firemen left the church on a Sunday
morning recently and ruined their best
suits without any hope of reward. There
is on record the fact that on two occa
sions the City Trustees have granted the
department the magnificent sum of $15.
A few months ago the hose company re
quested the City Trustees. to allow them
$15 a year, but it was not granted, the
board expressing a willingness to pay the
fire company if the members were ap
pointed by the Trustees. This would, of
course, take the Fire Department into
politics, and San Leandro frowned on the
proposition.
The firemen now have on hand $400
worth of property, which they offer to
sell to the city for $200, and so far the
Trustees have ignored this request. The
board, has been advised by the City Attor
ney that the firemen can give the city no
title to their property and that the city
â¢ cannot, therefore, buy it. A statement
issued by the firemen says:
"If the property does not belong to the
organization, to whom, then, does it be
long, tne firemen having paid for it? If it
belongs to them, why can't they give a
title to it?"
As the matter stands the outlook is
j not very pleasant to property owners.
MIGHT HAVE SAVED HER.
Police and Health Officer Dunn In
dignant Over Untimely Death
V. fy. â â¢'-.; -â â¢ of Anna Brooke.
OAKLAND, March Mrs. H. J. ]
Brooke and her surviving daughter, who i
were found sick and starving in the Oak- !
land House Sunday night, are greatly im- j
proved and in a fair way to recover. The j
daughter Anna, who died Sunday night, !
was buried yesterday. The death cer
tificate, signed by Dr. J. J. Caldwell, who
was called to attend the stricken family,
gives the cause of death as . ".pneumonia,
with want and destitution as contributory
and determining causes."
Dr. J. P. H. Dunn, the Health Officer,
who first ministered to the needs and suf
fering of the family, as well as the police,
are indignant over the alleged negligence
of the Associated Charities. They say
that when the case was reported ta Mrs.
Kelley, the superintendent of the asso
ciation, she declined to recognize the re
port outside of office hours.
Incidentally Health Officer- Dunn recom
mends the erection of a small city hos
pital for such emergency cases.
"Here was a life that could have been
saved under favorable conditions," said
Dr. Dunn to-day, referring to the death of
Miss Brooke. "What was most needed
was a warm, sunny room- and proper
nourishment. It was not afforded this
young woman and she died. At a small
expenditure a suitable building could be
put up and the city could not expend an
equal amount to better advantage "
BLIND HOME FINANCES.
Board of Trade Requests the Legis
lature to Act. ' bbb
OAKLAND, March The. Board of
Trade held a meeting this morning and
discussed the condition of finances of
the Blind Home at Temescal. Much dif
ference of opinion exists as to the man
ner in which the home should be run.
Dissatisfaction has. been great since the
Democratic board appointed Jack Hayes
superintendent in the place of a blind
man. As a result of the Board of Trade's
deliberations a set of resolutions was
passed.. . . â 
The resolutions set forth that, owing to
the high price of material and sharp
competition in the broom trade it is im
possible to conduct the broom factory
which furnishes the only source of em
ployment at the institution. A deficit of
$6000 has been incurred, and the board
asks that $5000 be appropriated by the
State Legislature that the factory may
be kept open. It also asks that the
former appropriation of $22,500 for the
maintenance of the home be raised to
$25,000. "â '-. - - j

JUROR SEIBEN PURSUED
BY PHANTOM SKELETONS
Alameda Office San Francisco Call,
: 1428 Park street, March 15.
THE uncanny exhibits in the Brandes
murder case have had such a pro
nounced effect on Juror Philip Sei
ben of this city that he has been
transferred from the realm of peace
ful thoughts to that wherein he
is haunted by horrible visions. Mr.
Seiben has been one of the most atten
tive of the jurors. He Is a capitalist, with
no apparent earthly cares, yet he has
worried over the Brandes case to such
an extent that his health has been under
mined. Twice has the case been delayed
on account of his condition.
He states that what made the greatest
impression on his mind was the basket
ful of skulls which was exhibited to the
jury.
"Since that horrible spectacle," says
Mr. Seiben, "I see skullsâ hideous, grin-
ning thingsâ wherever I go. During the
day I picture them in my mind's eye, and
in the night they haunt me while I sleep."
Mr. Seiben tells of some hair-raising
visions that have disturbed his slumber
and made his life almost a burden. He
has awakened from a troubled sleep to
picture grinning skulls perched . on the
foot of his bed. The jaws would snap to
gether, and he fancied that the -eyeless
sockets would open and shut. Then the
hideous things would dance about and
finally roll off the bedstead 'nto a basket.
On another occasion he dreamed he was

The "Well-Known Exhorter Pleads for
More Simplicity and Sincerity
in Religious
Life.
Alameda Offlce San Francisco Call,
1428 Park street, March 15.
Rev. Dwlght L. Moody, the renowned
evangelist, addressed two meetings In
Alameda to-day at Armory Hall. In the
afternoon every seat in the house was
taken and in the evening the hall was
crowded to the doors. .tV-b'v:
Although he is well along In years Rev.
Mr. Moody is still remarkably active. He
is a pleasant talker, using language free
from flights of flowery eloquence, which
appeals to the ordinary man or woman.
In the afternoon the subject of his ad
dress was "The Bible." His discourse
was earnest and straightforward . and
there was a plentiful smattering of wit
to vary the monotony. He is intensely or
thodox. He said he believed in the good
old-fashioned religion that came from the
heart and appealed to the soul. He took
a fling at sensational preachers and said,
that the true minister did not stray from
the Bible in his teachings. Rev. Mr.
Moody said he took the Bible just as he
found it, believing fully in all the good
book contained. r â  y-fy
"Some ministers," he said, "waste their
time explaining things in the Bible which
to them appear .Impossible. They are not
true believers. . We are told that the
story of Jonah and the whale is a fairy
tale, because no whale ever had a mouth
large enough to hold a man. Why, the
great God who made a world like this
could certainly make a whale big enough
to swallow Jonah, and I believe he did."

â¢Â§â¢â â â "â â  During the Past Decade.
9 /""\ AKLAND, March Dwight L. Moody arrived Jn Oakland this . morn-
X I I ing and during the next few days he will conduct a revival in this city.
<S II The well-known evangelist was accompanied from Santa Rosa by H.
ft J. McCoy and Noel H. Jacks, secretaries respectively of the San Fran
s> . cisco and Oakland Young Men's Christian Associations.
8 â¢ Several years have, elapsed since Mr. Moody; was in California, and he
X holds out great . hopes for the State's moral future. J
<Â£ "This State," said Mr. Moody, "has improved during the ten years since'
& I .was last here. I am delighted at the marked increase of interest in re
& ligious affairs. i The religious tone of the State seems to be far ahead of
9 what jit has ever been. More workers are going into -the ; field dally. The
rt jails are being visited and prisoners aided more than ever before. The State
<|> is being carefully worked, and where there are no churches there are serv
ed ices held somehow. I note with pleasure the tremendous amount of mission
& work being done in Peniel missions and Christian Endeavor societiesâ most
9 of it undertaken by volunteers. -.'. -
X "I am inclined to think that revival work is more popular among min
<â¢>. isters than it ever was. On my present trip I have seen more unity of action
& than I have ever noticed during my four previous trips." ,
<S> To-morrow afternoon Mr. Moody will speak at "the First M. E. Church, \
& and in the evening at the I Flcst Presbyterian Church, arid the same pro
s gramme will be followed till Sunday. On Sunday afternoon he will conduct a
<Â§> men's meeting at Dr. Coyle's church. r r# -y
sitting as a Juror ln a case where the
courtroom " was peopled with skeletons
clothed with the raiment iof the living.
Mr. Seiben was the only occupant of the
courtroom in the flesh. . He says he never
wants to pass through another such ex
perience. The Judge on the bench with
his fleshless Angers turned the pages of
his law books; his Jaws went through
the motions of speech, but no sound came
from his tongueless skull. The gesticu
lations of the attorneys- indicated a wran
gle, but no words gave a clew as to what
it was all about. ' â yy-f yyffyfjr;
"I will never forget that vistion to my
dying day," states Mr. Seiben. "It was
like being imprisoned in a receiving vault
with an army of corpses. I never felt
so relieved in my life as when I awoke
that night to find it was all a dream.
But since this case I cannot drive the
thought of skulls. out of my mind. I see
them everywhere. When I meet a friend
on the street I cannot restrain myself
from picturing him with nothing but a
bleached and fleshless skull on his shoul
ders. The sensation is horrible in the
extreme. When I meet a man, woman

or child carrying a basket I shrink from
them almost in terror, fancying that
their baskets are filled with human
skulls."
After the Brandes case is over Juror
Seiben will probably take a trip East in
an endeavor to forget the ghastly ex
hibits which have made such an impres
sion on him.)-;v :
personal magnetism. Rev. Mr. Moody ap
peals with much foreÂ© to the understand
ing of his audience. _â  '
The drift of his evening discourse was
the unregenerate nature of man.
"For a year a cry has been going
through the land, 'Remember the Maine,
because 300 sailors perished by that
awful disaster in Havana harbor." he
said. "Every twenty-four hours 300 men
are killed from drink, and I believe the
cry should be 'Remember rum.' Did you
ever live with a man who has never done
wrong? Well, I pity you if you have. If
you live under the same roof with such
a man you will be blamed for everything
that might happen to be wrong. I have
reached the conclusion that we are all
pretty bad and that we all should be born
again. One town I visited had thirteen
church members and ' seventeen saloons,
and the people of that burg . actually
thought they were good."
Rev. F. S. presided at both meet
ings. Music was furnished by a choir of
fifty voices, composed of soloists from all

the Alameda- churches, led by Professor
Tawner, who has charge of the musical
affairs of Rev. Mr. Moody's meetings.
Prayers were offered by Rev. C- E. Rich
and Rev. W. W. Scudder Jr. It was an
nounced that revival meetings will be
held to-morrow night in nearly all the
local churches to take advantage of the
good accomplished by Rev. Mr. Moody.

A REVIVAL OF EIGHTEENTH
â¢ CENTURY DRAMA.
Military Department Preparing to
Give a Sham Battle at the End
of the Term.
BERKELEY, March Something de
cidedly unique in the line of drama will be
attempted next week by several students
of the university under the direction of
Professor Louis Dv Pont Syle. It is to
be in the nature of a revival of eighteenth
century drama, intended principally for a
distinctively college audience. The play
selected is Oliver Goldsmith's comedy,
"The Good-natured Man/ For some
weeks past the cast has been engaged in.
a series of rehearsals, the presentation
being set for the two nights of March 22
and 23 at Shattuck Hall in the university
town.
The production will not follow literally
the comedy as originally written by Gold
smith. It has been specially recast and
arranged into four acts by Professor
Syle and Victor Henderson jointly. The
staging will be in eighteenth century
style throughout. Following is the list
of actors:
Sir William Honeywood. H. H. Hirst;
Charles Honeywood, A. J. Elston; Mr.
Croaker, F. T. Bioletti;Leontine Croaker,
Victor Henderson; Mr. Lofty, M. H.
Schwartz; bailiff, J. B. Southard; bailiff's
follower, Fred G. Dorety; Jarvis, Law
rence L. Greene; Miss Richland, Miss
Lola J. Simpson;- Mrs. Croaker, Miss
Katherine Wolfenden; Olivia, Miss L. E.
Moller; Garnet, Miss E. Lundy.
Professor Frank Soule, commandant of
the University Corps of Cadets, met the
commissioned officers of the corps this
afternoon, and after a brief discussion
decided to conclude tne work of the mili
tary department for the present term
with a sham battle, in which all the
college cadets, are to take part. The en
gagement will be a competitive one be
tween two bodies of the troops, organized
for offense and defense and commanded
by the majors of the First and Second
battalions. An ample supply of blank
ammunition is to be provided, and the
fight will follow as closely as possible the
maneuvers of an actual engagement. The
details of the offense and defense, to
gether with the general plan of opera
tions, will be left to the two majors in
command, assisted by the captains of
their battalions. yy- .- > Yy; y
President Kellogg passed his seventy-,
first birthday to-day. â¢ The occasion was
not allowed to go by without an appre
ciative remembrance on the part of the
students and others connected with the
University. A committee of the Asso
ciated Women Students brought flowers
and greens to the president's offlce early
this morning and completely transformed .
its appearance. A handsomely executed
motto, done in bright leaves and a dark
green background, was arched over the
desk. This piece was the work of Cap
tain Kelner, superintendent of the
grounds. Lilies and fruit blossoms were
arranged all around the room, and several
messages of congratulation lay on the
table. - Unfortunately, those who planned
the affair, intending it as a surprise to the
venerable head of the faculty as he should
enter his office this morning, were some
what disappointed, as the president was
unable to keep his hours to-day owing to
sickness. It is quite probable that he will
be well enough to-morrow to come to col
lege to see the preparations made in his
honor. ', . : -7

has done most efficient service. The
ordinance has been rigidly enforced.
When the first race was announced there
were hardly more than two hundred peo
ple on the grounds. The bookmakers'
blocks were vacant and police were on
watch in the paddock, the betting ring
and the grand stand. The vicious sport
that has ruined thousands of homes was
dispirited and dreary. The hum of ex
cited voices, the eagerness of gambling,
the presence of respectable men and
women were lacking. The gamblers were
in the midst of the ruins of their evil
fortunes. The city, through the combined
efforts of its reputable element, had
achieved a triumph that no one questions
is of Inestimable value to the community.
During the afternoon five arrests were
made. They represent little more than
the spite of the gamblers who have ruined
the legitimate sport of racing and
brought the people of the city to the point
where self-protection demanded rebellion.
Even the bookmakers were not in a mood
to defy the law that the people of the
city, in righteous indignation, had enact
ed. There were consequently few arrests
and it is expected that there will be fewer
to-day. Arrests will follow the slightest
violation of the ordinance and vigorous
prosecution will succeed arrest. The au
thorities of the city have acted with the
same intense personal interest as did the
clergymen, the press and the merchants
of the city.
The gamblers are in gloomy disgust.
The legitimate sportsmen of the city are
Indignant. They attribute to Corrigan
and his blackleg parasites the destruction
of a legitimate sport. Wherever Corri
gan has gone, they say, he has carried
disaster in his train. Wherever his hand
has been laid upon a sport the work of
decent sportsmen has turned to ashes.
He destroyed legitimate racing in Chi
cago and made it an evil against which
all reputable people rebelled. He came
discredited to San Francisco and here
prostituted racing until all people inter
ested in the welfare of 'the city arose in
arms. It. is upon Corrigan's shoulders,
therefore, that the sportsmen of San
Francisco place the blame of prohibition.
Under the circumstances these men hes
itate to do anything. The enforcement of
the ordinance will continue. The Chief
of Police says he will do his duty and
that gambling on horseraces will not be
tolerated within the limits of the city. On
Saturday Chief Lees will have a force
of police at Ingleside Coursing Park as
well as at the racetrack. In the courts
the arrested gamblers will have to an
swer. The bonds of those arrested have
been increased and the impudent actions
of a Police Court clerk at the track will
neither he tolerated nor repeated.
The betting ring at Ingleside presented
a cheerless aspect all day yesterday. The
bookmakers' stands or betting blocks
were deserted and each one was guarded
by two. policemen. The glistening coun
ters of the gambling booths, over which
has passed many a dollar filched by some
tempted youth from his employers, were
untenanted. The alluring price-boards
lay face downward on the floor, and the
seductive voice of the "bookie" was si
lenced. It was a scene of desolation,
each block wearing the mournful aspect
of a deserted bird's nest.
When the first train arrived at the
track many of its load of disheartened
gamblers went directly to the secretary's
office, where they inquired if the book
makers intended to defy the law and ac
cept wagers on the day's races. Green
and Corrigan were both questioned in this
connection, but neither of them professed
to know what the bookmakers intended
to do.
The presence of Chief Lees, Captains
Wittman and Gill en, accompanied by a
squad of fifty patrolmen, soon set all
doubts at rest. Not one of the sixteen
bookmakers who have thrived for years
at their nefarious and vicious game at
tempted to gamble before the first two
races were over
Then Hughie Jones, a bookmaker, who
was arrested on Tuesday, attempted to
play a joke on the police.
Just before the beginning of the fourth
race Jones and two touts, H. Hlnton and
Frank Brook, got up Into the farthest
betting block near the field books and
announced that they were ready to do
business.
J. Oppenheimer, another tout, then pro
ceeded to go through the form of making
a bet. He passed Jones the money and
the latter ordered Hinton and Brooks to
write the ticket. Following out their in
structions they made out a ticket on a
horse that was entered in the race but
which was subsequently scratched.
The moment Jones handed Oppenheimer
the ticket the police arrested tbe men.
All laughed heartily, thinking it was a
good joke on the police, but when they
were hustled into a patrol wagon they
saw the joke in another light. At the
City Prison the dejected quartet were re
leased on $500 bonds put up by the asso
ciation.
The only other arrest made was that of
Al Leech, an old man, who Stepped into
one of the blocks just before the fifth
race and announced that he was ready to
sell auction pools on the race.
"This is not a percentage game, mind
you," he said to his listeners. "I am
simply going to sell auction pools. How
much am I bid?"
The policemen who had gathered around
were mystified for a moment by the new
dodge.
"How much am I bid?" shouted the old
man lustily, a gleam of defiance in his
eyes.
"Fifty dollars," shouted back one of the
gamblers in the background.
Then Captain Wittman sprang into the
block and placed Leech under arrest.
The police captain placed Leech in
charge of an officer, saying, "Charge this
man with violating section 664 of the
Penal Code."
"That section of the code provides for
the arrest of persons who even make an
attempt to commit an overt act against
the laws, and I guess that covers this
case," said the captain as Leech was hur
ried to the patrol wagon.
Throughout the afternoon Chief Lees
moved from place to place in the betting
ring watchful lest the gamblers would
resort to underhand artifices to defeat the
new ordinance.
A few bookmakers and other track ope
rators more daring than the rest, estab
lished'a system of betting which the po
\.r. nowerless to prevent. The eya
tern became known as the day wore on as
"hand booking."
The betting, however, was for the most
part confined to a narrow circle of gam
blers and was not conducted on an ex
tensive scale. Several of the "hand
bookies" assembled before each race and
agreed on the prices offered on the dif
ferent horses. Then they allowed those
whom they knew intimately to bet.
A person who was desirous of placing
a bet on a horse would walk up to one
of- the hand bookies, ask the price of
fered on the animal's chances and then
when the police were not looking would
hand the bookie the money. After each
race the "hand bookie" kept moving from
one part of the betting ring to the other,
shaking hands with his lucky customer*.
at the same time handing them the
amount of money they won on the race.
The police, knew that this sort of gam
bling was being carried on, but it was
practically an impossibility to catch the
gamblers at their new artifice to violate
the law. If they were detected passing
money to anybody they would simply say
that they were lending the money or pay
ing a debt. Chief Lees declared that if
the gamblers attempt to violate the law
in this" manner to-day he would arrest
every person suspected of the practice
on a charge of vagrancy.
The only subject of conversation in the
City Hall yesterday was the practices of
Police Court clerks in accepting bonds in
discriminately and the issuance of orders
of release outside the court hours. Un
der the law clerks of the Police Court are
authorized to accept bonds In any sum
up to and including $1000. While this law
is often the means of relieving many per
sons of the disgrace of imprisonment on
petty charges, the wide latitude of the
consolidation act permitted many abuses
of the system. The Police Department
complains bitterly of this practice. They
assert that their endeavors to enforce the
vagrancy act are almost completely
vitiated by the Police Court clerks, who
Issue releases for prisoners, whose friends
have a political pull, before they are
booked at the City Prison.
Jack Rice, clerk of Judge Conlan's court,
feels aggrieved because the newspapers
published the fact that he went to Ingle
side track to accept bonds and release
gamblers as fast as they were arrested
by the police. Rice declares his action
was perfectly legal and not unusual
enough to subject him to any criticism.
He says he went to the race track to
oblige his friend, Henry Ach, who inform
ed him that a raid was to be made. Mr.
Ach furnished all the bonds and orders for
releases and he signed them when re
quested to do so. Rice further asserts
that under the law he is obliged to accept
bonds when the sureties swear they are
worth the amount of the undertaking, and
that his refusal to accept bonds under,
those circumstances would render his
bondsmen liable to a suit for damages.
There is no law, written or other
wise, which compels a court official
to discharge his duties at a race
track or in the back room of a saloon.
The articles in yesterday's papers had
one 'salutary effect on the Police Court
clerks. None of them wished to run afoul
of their masters, the Board of Super
visors, and the Ingleside attorneys .were
informed that they would be obliged to
come to the City Hall to secure the lib
eration of any more gamblers who might
be arrested. For the flrst time in many
months the warrant clerks were In their
offices after 12 o'clock. They received in
formation from members of the Board of
Supervisors that Rice's assistance to the
gamblers was liable to get him Into trou
ble and perhaps cause his discharge. Po
litical positions with large salaries and
little work are hard to get, and the Po
lice Court clerks may now be depended
upon to respect the orders passed by the
Board. V-.- ? ,
Judge Mogan, at the request of Chief
Lees, made an order fixing the bonds for
the five men arrested yesterday at 5500
each. The Chief took further precautions
to block a repetition of Tuesday's farce
by ordering the desk sergeants not to
liberate any man brought in from the
i track without an order from himself.
The lawyer employed by the jockey
club expected a big raid yesterday after
noon, and the associate counsel remained
at the City Hall with bondsmen and kept
in touch with the Police Court clerks. A
large bundle of bonds was prepared, and
It was arranged that as soon as an ar
rest was made at the track the name of
the prisoner was to be telephoned to the
City Hall and a release would be imme
diately obtained. So yesterday afternoon
the people's employes were waiting
around the cheerless corridors of the City
Hall to assist the gamblers in their en
deavors to violate the law and keep out
of jail.
Henry Ach, attorney for the Ingleside
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALI., THURSDAY, MARCH 16, 1899.
gamblers, was too busy yesterday to tell
what line he would pursue to combat the
order prohibiting pool selling in the city.
He said no plan would be formulated un
til the complaints were made out and
presented in court. He denied any inten
tion to ask for an injunction restraining
the police from making further arrests.
GAMBLERS MUST
STAND TRIAL
An Ineffectual Plea for
Dismissal.
Police Judge Mogan refused yesterday
to discharge the twenty men arrested at
Ingleside Tuesday afternoon for violating
the anti-pool law. Henry Ach, attorney
for the bookmakers, demanded an imme
diate dismissal of the cases on the ground
that no formal complaints charging any
offense had been filed against his clients.
Judge Mogan censured the Police Depart
ment for neglecting to have the arrest
ing officers swear to complaints, and
finally, in order that a test case might
be started, he ordered the hearing con
tinued until 10 a. m. this morning.
All the defendants and a large crowd of
Interested spectators were present when
Department 1 of the Police Court was
called to order. Only two or three police
officers who were in the raid at the track
were present. Captain Gillen and Ser
geant Martin were there to represent the
department. The proceedings were
opened by Attorney Ach, who addressed
the court as soon as the spectators were
quieted. He first informed his Honor that
he represented the twenty men arrested
at the race track and then demanded the
discharge of all of them and also the
exoneration of the bondsmen. He argued
that, as there were no complaints, the
defendants could not be held an instant.
Judge Mogan interrupted Ach and post
poned action on the cases for one hour.
His Honor asked why the police had not
attended to this essential point. Prose
cuting Attorney Joachimsen answered for
Chief Lees and his subordinates, saying
they had not had time to draw, up the
necessary papers and swear to them. Ach
declared the negligence of the prosecution
was no concern of his, and renewed his
demand for dismissal. An hour later all
parties interested were again in the court
room and Attorney Ach asked for a rul
ing on his motion. Judge Mogan said he
would first listen to the Prosecuting At
torney. Joachimsen said it had always
been the custom in the Police Courts to
allow the officers reasonable time to pre
pare complaints where persons were ar
rested on misdemeanor charges without
a warrant. As this case is of great pub
public importance he asked for a contin
ance of one day. Mr. Ach again demand
ed the release of his clients and addressed
KILLING INGLESIDE'S EVIL BY AUTHORITY OF LAW.
the court at length on the law.
As a matter of fact and law the de
fendants are riot legally held, because of
the delay on the part of the police, and
the defense took an exception to the
court's denial of the motion to dismiss.
The Judge hesitated slightly before
holding the defendants, and ruled against
dismissal simply to save a lot of trouble
for every one concerned.
During the afternoon Prosecuting At
torney Joachimsen drew up separate com
plaints against the twenty prisoners and
these were signed and sworn to by the
arresting officers. They will be presented
in court at 10 o'clock this morning. The
bonds accepted at the race track by Clerk
Rice of Judge Conlan's court were, satis
factory to Judge Mogan, and the gam
blers were free to return to Ingleside fo*
the day's races. The sureties were John
Malowansky, a director of the Pacific
Coast Jockey Club, and A. Ottinger. Bond
Expert Chris Newman examined the
bonds yesterday morning and reported to
Chief Lees and Judge Mogan that the
sureties were good.
The prosecution will take up the cases
of Levy and Wall this morning, as the
police have the strongest case against
these defendants.
Judge E. H. Mogan of Department 1 of
the Police Court, to whom the book
makers' cases have been assigned, will
take up the trial of these men the first
thing this morning. Regarding the issue
Judge Mogan says:
"I desire to proceed Immediately with
this matter and bring it to a speedy term
ination. Whether or not the issue will
come before me on its merits depends
wholly q|>on the lawyers. I have no
prejudice in the matter and will, at the
proper time, interpret the order of the
Board of Supervisors to the best of my
ability.
"I continued the test case a day in or.
der to give both sides a fair chance to
prepare their cases. The complaints
should have been filed before the calendar
was called at the opening of court this
morning, but that of course I cannot
help.
"If either side demands a jury trial,
which is quite probable, the case cannot
I go to trial before next week, as all the
time this week will be occupied with
cases now set."
MEET DEFEAT
AT SACRAMENTO
Mose Gunst and His Allies
Repulsed.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, March 15.â California" Legis
lature will not legalize the gambling game
at Ingleside that has been prohibited by
the Board of Supervisors of San Fran
cisco. This much was determined to
day after President Androus and ! Vice
President Henry J. Crocker of the Ingle
side track, together with Mose Gunst and
others, had exerted every influence at
their command in a fruitless endeavor to
induce legislators to assist them in
thwarting the will of the people of the
metropolis.
The race track gamblers directed their
attention principally to the Senate, hop.
ing no doubt that the smaller member
ship of- the upper house of the Legisla
ture would provide them a more favora
ble opportunity for the use of the cor
rupt means by which they hope to secure
favorable consideration for the measur*
by which they hope to rob the citizens of
San Francisco of their rights. If this
was their object, it met with signal fail
ure, for with few "exceptions the Sena
tors turned a deaf ear to the plaint of
the racing men, and the day ended with
no better prospect in view for the Ingle
side jobbers than total defeat of their
scheme for relief by means of State leg
islation. To-morrow the racing contin
gent already on the ground is to be re
inforced by Ed Corrigan and others of
the Ingleside combine and a final effort
will be made to induce legislators to cast
their votes for some law that will have
the effect of setting aside the action taken
by the Board of Supervisors of San Fran
cisco on Monday.
Even the poolsellersâ the men who de
feated Dan Burns, Corrigan and the com
bined race track following last week in
the matter of restricting poolselling and
bookmaking at race tracks, thereby giv
ing the Ingleside and . Emeryville tracks
!an exlusive privilege of the gambling
game refused to "stand In" with the
Ingleside outfit to-day. They declared
that they do not care whether or not the
Ingleside track is closed, as it will not
affect their business, and they refuse to
take a hand in any legislation in opposi
tion to the desire of the people of San
Francisco. They go farther than this and
declare that they are more than pleased
that the track at Ingleside has been closed
by the Board of t Supervisors of the
metropolis for the reason that the act
administers a well merited rebuke to Cor
rigan, Ullman and others, who, they say,
have had more to do with bringing dis
credit on the sport of horse racing than
all other influences put together. The
bookmakers and poolsellers, therefore,
approve of the sentiment that has prompt
ed the people of San Francisco to demand
that bookmaking at Ingleside shall stop,
their approval being based on the asser
tion that Corrigan and his associates
were in a fair way to kill the racing game
by their methods.
The "practical politicians" who are
present in Sacramento in force, and who
are always counted on to lend assistance
to shady measures of the kind proposed
by the Ingleside race track gamblers, held
aloof from the proposition to pass a law
that would do away with the good work
done in San Francisco on Monday. The
story of the $20,000 that is to be used to
bring about the desired legislation had
had its effect with the members of the
third house of the Legislature, but in
face of the fact which is apparent to
every one that the Senate will have none
of the proposition, no one could be found
who would agree to be identified with It
even in the lobby.
During the morning session of the Sen
ate many of the members wereapproached
on the subject of racetrack legislation of
the kind intended to defeat the will of
the people of San Francisco, and were
asked for advice as to the best form of
presenting the proposed law. The
schemers suggested that it might be at
tached to the general appropriation bill
as an amendment to the district fair
clause, or, failing in that. ! it might be
brought before the Legislature as a sub
stitute for some, bill that has been rele
gated to the end of the file, there to die.
Such a bill, it was suggested, could be
brought forward and put on the urgency
file, and by judicious amendment and
substitutions could be put in shape to be
rushed through both houses of the Legis
lature before the end of the session.
These suggestions met with cold disfavor
on the part of the Senators.
To add to the woes of the Ingleside
gamblers they, were flatly told that they
need, expect no help from the managers
or friends of the racetrack at Emeryville,
in Alameda County. This was a severe
blow, because there are several members
of the Legislature who are favorable to
the interests of the Emeryville track and
who were naturally expected to lend a
helping hand to the scheme proposed by
the Ingleside crowd. Late fn the after
noon the Ingleside forces were withdrawn
from the Capitol. to await the arrival to
night of Corrigan and his reserve forces
from the metropolis. To-night a consul
tation is being held to decide as to what
step can be taken to-morrow to retrieve
the disastrous defeat of to-day.
The presence of Police Commissioner
Gunst in Sacramento at this particular
time, and the fact that he is identifying
himself with legislation favorable to the
gambling Interests of a certain class of
people in San Francisco, is attracting
much unfavorable comment from legis
lators from interior . districts. They de
clare it does not speak- well for the
morals of a city, when one of its chief
peace officers concerns himself in assist
ing the passage of laws that are recog
nized as being designed to nrotect a class
of people whose business Is antagonistic
to the best interests of the community in
which they live.
A SCHEME TO
INVADE MARIN
Gamblers Discuss Another
Project.
SAUSALITO, -March 15.â For two â  days
the gamblers and politicians of ! this town
have been running back and forth be
tween the various saloons, varying the
monotony of their action by an occa
sional visit to San Francisco. Confer
ences have been held behind closed doors
in the rear of Tom Frost's and "Billy"
MacMUlan's saloon. To-day the secret
came out. The gamblers are trying to
have the Ingleside track moved to Marin
County. y
Early in the day the rumor of this de
sire on the part of the gambling frater
nity had reached San Rafael and was al
most the sole topic of discussion. Noth
ing definite can be learned, for those
who are in a position to know maintain
the utmost reticence.
There Is only one suitable location for a
track in the county, and that is in the
neighborhood' of San Clemente. Two
years ago a man named McCue built a
half-mile track, but it soon closed down.
Later Dan Burns came near buying the
Lucas property as a breeding farm, the
track being included In the land bar
gained for, but for some unknown rea
son the deal fell through. It is stated
that by filling a part of the marsh this
half-mile track could easily be length
ened to a mile course.
"Well," said "Billy" MacMHlan, giving
the wink that has made him so widely
known, when questioned to-day, "I don't
care to N say anything about the matter
further than to say that there is some
ground for the rumor. This I will defi
nitely assert: No active measures will be
taken toward securing the track for Ma
rin County unless the Ingleside men fail
to obtain relief in the courts. If they
don't, you may expect to hear something
later on."
"WHITE HAT" M'CARTY
STARVES DUMB BEASTS
THE HORSEMAN WILL BE AR
RESTED TO-DAY.
Fourteen Horses That Had Been Re
duced to Shadows Taken
to the Found.
"White Hat" McCarty's propensity for
starving dumb animals and leaving them
unsheltered to the mercies of the weather
have got him into trouble again.
Yesterday fourteen of his horses,
starved to the bone, were taken to the
public pound shortly after they had fin
ished their dinner on fence posts, boards,
etc., in a corral at Seventh avenue and
B street. The officers of the Society for
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, at
whose instance the poor brutes were re
lieved from their pitiful condition, are
determined that McCarty shall suffer for
his treatment and announce that he will
swear out a warrant for his arrest this
morning.
For some time past patrons of the
Geary and Sacramento street car lines
have noticed the starving horses grovel
ing in the sand hill and have commented
upon their poor appearance. None of
these people seemed willing, however,
to make a complaint,- and it remained
for Officer J. J. Bagley, whose beat ex
tends in the vicinity, to notify the Cen
tral police station yesterday. Officer W.
T. Hooper of the Society for Prevention
of Cruelty to Animals visited the prem
ises during the afternoon. "When he ar
rived he found the beasts gnawing on
fence boards, most of which they had al
most reduced to slats. The boards had
been broken down in some places where
the horses had made efforts to reach
little patches of grass that grew along
the sidewalk. The entire side of a barn
had been gnawed so badly as to be notice
able for blocks. Un the premises was not
a handful of feed.
The stables and corral are the property
of Warren & Malley, who employ E.
Freyer as hostler. Freyer says the horses
were sent there about six months ago
and have occupied the stalls until three
weeks ago, when they were turned into
1 the corral at the request of their owner.
Since that time they have remained in
the open every night without even a shed
for shelter.
Simultaneously with the arrival of the
Sound men a boy drove up with a single
ale of hay, which he said had been sent
from McCarty's stables on Tehama street.
It was intended to feed the fourteen an
imals and weighed about 150 pounds. The
boy stated that a bale had been sent out
daily, but he could only account for those
which he brought out at various times.
Freyer sustains him in this statement,
but the condition of the animals would
indicae that one bale arrived weekly.
McCarty's name has been on the rec
ords of the society before. Complaints
have been made against him frequently
since he possessed animals, and on sev
eral occasions the officers were obliged
to force him to take better care of his
stock. The horses which were taken yes
terday were all blooded horses and were
kept for sale. Freyer, the man in charge,
says that he had no instructions to care
for the horses and took no pains to do
so. It will cost McCarty $4 per head to
secure the release of the animals, besides
whatever expense may be incurred after
his arrest.
TOM WILLIAMS IS WINNER.
Successful in His Civil Action
Against M. Marx.
The Supreme Court has given a deci
sion In favor of Thomas 11. Williams, the
horseman, in his case against M. Marx.
About a year ago Williams sold to Marx
a piece of real estate on Grand Island in
the Sacramento River. He received a de
posit of $1000, a -written agreement being
signed by the two parties that If in
case the title to the property was good
the balance should be paid, but if the
title should be defective the money was
to be returned to Marx. The latter re
fused to pay the remainder and demanded
the return of the deposit on the ground
that the title was not perfect.
His contention was that Williams re
ceived the land upon an order of distri
bution of court in the case of the estate
of the late Thomas H. Williams Sr.,
father of the party in this suit, and was
unable to give a perfect title to land thus
received. Williams brought the action to
compel Marx to live up to his part of
the written agreement, and he won his
suit in the lower court. The higher court
agrees with the lower court, holding that
the title of Williams is good and that he
can give a good title to a purchaser.
