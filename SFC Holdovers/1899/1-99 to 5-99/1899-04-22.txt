HAS ITALY
GONE OVER
TO FRANCE?
King Humbert's Squadron
Is to Pay a Visit to
Toulon.
Special Cable to The Call and New York Herald. Copyrighted, 1899, by-
James Gordon ."Tennett.
PARIS. April 22.â 1t would seem as if the Cagliari fetes
were likely to have a sensational sequel. According; to
this morning's Figaro, there is no question of the Italian
squadron paying a visit to Toulon in September next, at which
date President Loubet is expected to be the guest of the great
southern naval port of France.
King Humbert, it appears, will send a special representa
tive with the squadron, bearing an autograph letter to the
President of the republic.
In this connection. Figaro's correspondent writes from
Toulon: "The launch of the cruiser Jeanne d'Arc, fixed for
the end of March, has been suddenly postponed for no appar
ent reason. The cause oi the delay is the President's coming
visit, which will assume an important character. It is said the
King of Italy will seize this opportunity to send his squadron
to salute the President of the republic."
La Patrie, in an article headed "Dislocation of the Triple
Alliance." says: "King Humbert's speech was amiable and Ad
miral Fournier's significant. He exalted the talent and clear
sightedness shown by his "Majesty's Ministers in the conduct of
public affairs, which means that they had done well to abandon
Germany.
"The King replied by assuring France of his sentiments of
cordial friendship, language praiseworthy in itself, but which
proves that Germany's ally has gone some way since he sent
his son to inspect the fortifications of Metz.
"The German press notes this defection, and with it the
disintegration of the triple alliance. The play of politics is
sometimes very curious. Two years ago German journalists
were chaffing the splendid isolation of which discomfited Albion
in lack of anything better was boasting. Now that threat
ened conflict brings Germany and England face to face, the for
mer sees with anxiety that her allies of previous days have de
serted her. and the latter boasts this time of menacing her with
the support of the United States. But who knows? To-mor
row, perhaps, the cards will be shuffled again."
MILES WILL
FIGHT FOR A
VINDICATION
To Demand a Court-Martial
to Try Members of the
Beef Court.
Pr> e( Mal PlFrvat'-h to ThÂ«> rail.
WASHINGTON, April 21.â 1t is now
thought iikely that the report of the
army court of inquiry that has been
investigating General Milep' charges re
garding th" food supply of the army in
the war with Spain will be submitted
to thÂ» President not later than Tuesday
of rir-xt wr<k.
General MileÂ« has already anticipated
an adverse verdict and has outlined a
plan of art ion to continue hie light for
vindication. Miles has been in consul
tation with friends on the subject for
pome time, and has derided to have re
course, if necessary, to an investigation
by Cnntxrr-sK, first, however, making a
demand for a prompt court-martial of
thf members of the court of inquiry.
Those with whom Mil<-s has nonsuited
are, as a rule, critics of the administra
tion, and it is understood that Senator
Foraker will lead the fight in Congress
in behalf of Miles, and that he will have
the support of Republicans who have
for some time talked of making Miles
a Presidential candidate.
It is a part of Miles' plan to file
charges with the President against the
members of the court of inquiry as sooh
as the report is made public, in which
it will be asserted there was not a full,
fair and impartial Investigation. He
will declare that one member of the
court was prejudiced, against him and
this member was largely Instrumental
in having him defeated for a lieutenant
generalcy by statements before the mil
itary committee that reported adversely
on the measure, and this same member
prepared the adverse report of the
committee.
It will be asserted generally that the
members of the court violated their
oaths to inquire well and truly into the
matter and to render a decision accord
ing to the evidence. On this point Miles
will insist that the evidence, according
to his understanding, does show that
refrigerated beef supplied the army
was chemically treated.
Should the President refuse to order
a court-martial for the members of the
court then Miles' friends in Congress,
assisted by the opponents of the ad
ministration, will demand a Congres
sional investigation, which Central
Miles believes will clearly establish his
charges against the members of the
court and render a court-martial n<<rs
sary.

A GRAVE ACCUSATION
Chicago Newspaper Says the Presi
dent Is in Possession of Trea
sonable Telegrams.
Sppcial Dispatch to The Call.
CHICAGO, April 21. A Washington
special to tho [nter Ocean says: The
Cabinei discussed to-day the latest and
most serious feature "!' the Philippine
question. I: was in relation i" traitors
in this country who arc attempting to
incite mutiny among our own troops
in the Islands.
The administration has evidence to
show that certain anti-expansionists,
who used great efforts to defeat the
plan to hold the Philippines, have gone
bo far as t" send messages to the vol
unteers with the purpose of causing
dissatisfaction, and even inciting mu
tiny. This in w development in the
anti expansion campaign came as a
complete surprise to the administra
tion, but it fitted in with other evidence
accumulated some weeks ago, showing
not only that Agoncillo, while in this
country, received moral and substantial
support from certain anti-expanslon
ists, but tint messages were sent to
Aguinaldo to encourage him in his re
sistanco to the authority of this Gov
ernment.
This evidence <-f treasonable conspir
acy was passed ov< r on th" ground
that it was more sentimental than In
tentionally criminal, but later develop
ment, showing thai some of these ]>â¢â¢"
pie are willing t" go to the extreme of
inciting mutiny in th" army, will com
pel the Government to give it serious
attention. It is said the administration
has obtained possession of telegrams

country for the purpose of creating a
mutinous spirit among the volunteers
because they had not been sent home
Immediately after the conclusion of
â  between Spain and the I'nited
States.
It is also regarded a? strange that
certain American correspondents in
Manila. Including the represi ntative of
the Associated Press and of the New
York World, should discover conditions
which aio not discoverable to the cor
respondents <>f the Liendon papers, or
of the Paris and Berlin papers, which
havf every reason to publish the dark
Bide of the American campaign in the
Philippines.
The European and Hongkong: papers
have rot published so discouraging re
ports from Manila as has the Associated
Press, which has discovered that only
7 per cent of the volunteers in the
archipelago are willing to remain, and
that all the others are much dissatis
fied. The War Department has tried to
learn if there was any foundation for
these reports and I able to se
cure no evidence of ih^-ir truth.
The alleged interview with Lawton,
saying that not less than 100,000 men
could hold the Philippines, is also dis-
badly burned that it was impossible to
remove him during the fire. Every ef
fort was made to check the conflagra
tion, but, there being no fire engine,
the flames soon enveloped the entire
building. By the united efforts of those
pr<?ent the records and some furniture
in the various offices were saved. The
Hall of Records, a fire-proof building
near by, was not damaged; neither was
the jail, which adjoined the main build

credited. But th^s^ press reports from
the Philippines are ignored on the the
ory that they come from correspondents
more desirous of sending sensational
dispatches than they are of sustaining
the army. They have, however, pre
pared the way and furnished the ex
ruse for treasonable work at home, and
certain anti-expansionists are known
to have .sent messages to the volun
teers in th<> Philippines, encouraging
them to ignore the duty before them as
soldiers and rebel against the author
ity they enlisted to fight for.
With such work going on on both
sides of the Pacific, a big press organi

news from the Philippines regarding
the loyalty of the volunteers and promi
nent American citizens at home sending
mpssages to the volunteers encouraging
mutiny the administration is confronted
with a condition of treason which it is
frit cannot be ignored.
While practically nothing of what

MERCHANTS'
VIGILANCE
COMMITTEE
One Section of Chicago at
the Mercy of Bands of
Desperadoes.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CHICAGO, April 21.â Merchants do
ing business and citizens living in the
vicinity of West Madison street and
California avenue, and for a dozen
blocks in every direction from the In
tersection of the streets named, have
been thrown into a panic of fear by
numerous unprovoked murders, bold
daylight robberies and midnight burg
laries occurring there in the past few
weeks, and propose calling a meeting
for the purpose of forming a vigilance
committee..^,'
Hold-ups of saloons, grocery stores
and laundry offices by bands of armed
men have become so common that they
no longer excite comment. Cora Hen
derson, the housokofper in a fiat on
Madison street, near California avenue,
was murdered a few nights ago by
burglars. George G. Fern, a merchant,
was called from his house a few morn
ings since by a man who said he wanted
to buy underwear to replenish his ward
robe before taking an early train from
the city. Not returning to breakfast,
his son ran to the store to call him, and
found him dead and the money drawer
rifled.
Thursday five men backed a wagon
up to the door of a manufacturing
tailor's establishment, drove the clerks
into closets by making a show of re
volvers, loaded the wagon with goods
and drove away.
Not one of the men perpetrating these
murders, hold-ups or daylight whole
sale robberies has been apprehended.
The police seem powerless to prevent
crime or detect criminals, and now
merchants and others propose to take
the matter into their own hands. Citi
zens living in rented apartments are
moving away from the district, and as
a result property is depreciating in
value. This has caused real estate own
ers to join with the merchants in pro
posing the adoption of primitive forcible
methods for the suppression and pun
ishment of crime. Nearly every store
within the past week has placed a man
instead of a woman at the cashier's
desk and armed him with a short shot
gun in place of a revolver as a means
of defense.

PRICE FIVE CENTS.
SACRAMENTO, April 21.â To-night
the center of interest of the
Knights Templar Conclave was
transferred to the Crocker Art
Oallery, where the members of
the Sacramento eommanderies. their
wives and daughters, received the vis
iting Knights and ladles. To say that
the art grallery presented a beautiful
sight would be but mildly expressive
of the fart. Deft hands had been at
work all day arranging green plants
and delicate blossoms in tasteful dis
play, and the art gallery, the scene of
so many brilliant receptions, seldom if
ever appeared more captivating. There
are TOO works of art in the galleries,
and there was a rare pleasure in prom
enading through these apartments
while music floated up from the crowd
ed assembly room below. The women
looked their best in light garments,
and the Knights, attired in their dress
suits, enjoyed the opportunity to meet
the wives and daughters of the local
members of the order under conditions
calling for the most thorough socia
bility.
The reception had scarcely hegun
when the drill corps of California and
Golden Gate Commanderies of San
Francisco reached the city by special
train, which made exceedingly quick
time in order that the Knights and
their ladies might be present at the art
gallery reception. The drill corns was
escorted to the hotels and within an
hour the delegation was among the
most interested of the hundreds of the
guests who thronged the city's shrine
of art and sculpture, which was to
night a shrine of feminine and floral
loveliness as well.
The committee having charge of the
reception at the art gallery to-night
was composed of Mrs. E. W. Hale,
chairman, and the following:: Mrs.
Thomas Scott, .Mrs. E. C. Atkinson.
Mr?. Robert Alexander, Mrs. L. F.
Breuner. Mrs. David Farr. Mrs. \V. A.

Mrs. T. B. Reid, Mrs. John Breuner.
Mrs. A. A. Redington. Mrs. E. B. Willis
and Mrs. H. E. Yardley.
An elaborate Instrumental and vocal
programme was presented, and there
were countless small tables distributed
about the halls where the guests might
sit and converse, or play cards, or sip
dainty refreshment, as the inclination
went.
At the meeting of the Grand En
campment this afternoon the follow
ing officers were elected:
Right eminent grand commander-John
F. Merrill of San FranciFi-o.
Deputy grand commanderâ Frederick
Miller of Fresno.
Grand generalissimoâ George B. McKee
of San Jose.
Grand captain generalâ William Frank

baugh of Los Angeles.
Grand prelateâ J. P. March of Chico.
Grand treasurer â Edward Coleman of
San Francisco.
Grand recorderâ William A. Davies of
San Francisco.
The Grand Commandery refused to
adopt the resolution calling for a re
duction in the admission fee to the
Knights Templar. The installation of
the officers elect was made the special
order for to-morrow afternoon at 2
o'clock.
A resolution offered by Deputy Grand
Commander John F. Merrill, extend
ing a vote of thanks to the people of
Sacramento for their hospitality in en
tertaining the visiting Sir Knights was
unanimously adopted. The chairman
of the committee on jurisprudence sub
mitted a report approving the rulings
of the grand commander.
Los Angeles was chosen as the next
meeting place of the Grand Encamp
ment, and Tuesday, April 24, as the
date.
Grand Commander-elect John F.
Merrill informed The Call correspond-
eht to-night that he would submit the
list of appointive officers at the meet

SOUTH DAKOTANS ROUT
A FORCE OF REBELS
MANILA, April 21.â The heat is in
tense. At noon the thermometer regis
tered 95 degrees and the mercury was
still rising. There were several pros
trations from the heat among the
troops.
The army tugs opened fire on the
enemy along the river banks. The
rebels are unusually active west of
Malolos as far as Calumpit. They have
been busily at work on their trenches
and several new (.-nes have been dis
covered within two miles of the rail
road. Fires are burning east of the
railroad, and it would appear that the
rebels are evacuating the foothill towns,
in anticipation of an attack upon the
part of the American troops.
At 6 o'clock this morning three com
panies of the South Dakota Regiment
marched from Bocave and in conjunc
tion with three companies of the Min
nesota Regiment from Guiguinto, north
of Bovace, encountered a rebel force
numbering fully 500 men when two
miles out. The enemy retired three
miles in fairly good order, in spite of
the fact that the rebels suffered heavy
losses The Americans, having ex
hausted their ammunition, were com
pelled to return to the camps.

Colombia Calls Congress to Con

por Further Time.
Â© NEW YORK, April 21.â Eduardo Esplnosa, Consul General of Co
*Â£ lombia, who Is in Now York, received a cablegram to-day from his Gov
i eminent that President San Clemente has convoked Congress to decide
O whether the new Panama Canal Company's concession shall be extended
â¦ Biz years. It will be a special session of Congress, called mainly to set
-5 tie this question.
O President San Clemente gave a hearing several months ago to the
jÂ£ Panama Canal Company's representatives and promised to submit a
+ contract for an extension of time to Congress, which must pass upon the
q matter. It is believed the object of the canal company is to obtain an
-4- extension with the hope that it will be able to dispose of the property
O to the United Skates. If the Colombian Congress should decide not to ex
jÂ£ tend the concession the canal company's property will pass into the
X Government's hands.
Â© Senor Espinosa said to-day that he thought the question of exten
q sion will depend largely on the report which Senor Esquerra, as special
>â¢ commissioner of Colombia, would make to his Government. Senor Es
Â© querra has been examining work on the canal for a long period, and

STEADY RISE OF
MISSOURI RIVER
Danger Line Will Soon
Be Passed.
Special Pispatrh to The Call.
OMAHA, April 21.â The Missouri
River is now within less than a foot
of the danger point here and Is steadily
rising at the rate of about eight inches
in twenty-four hours. Weather bureau
reports hold out no encouragement for
an immediate improvement, and the
rise will probably continue until Sun
day, if not longer. This will take the
water above the danger line and will
cause some loss of property on the
bottoms.
A dozen families residing In East
Omaha were driven out to-day, and to
night the water stands eighteen inches
on the floors of their houses. The
stream that bruke through from Flor-
Lake to Cut off Lake last night
et wide, several feet deep
and i:-- tearing away great banks of
earth. It follows the old course of the
river near the Nebraska shore and a
rise of another foot would make it a
raging torrent.
<ni the other side to-day several feet
"f th- Illinois Central grading was
washed out and a large amount of
nment rip-rapping destroyed.
Railroad men are anxiously watching
tin- situation and have squads of men
stationed at each bridge. A forc< "t
nundred men has been at work all
day strengthening the embankments at
th( south end of Florence Lake, but the
water carries matter away as fast as
it is thrown in. The tracks of the
Omaha Terminal Company at this point
are submerged for several hundred feet.

SIOUX CITY, April 21.â The Missouri
River continues to rise and trr-night la
nearly nineteen feet above low water

Sioux City, all farms and truck gardens
are completely flooded and people have
barely escaped with their lives. Sev
eral persons <>n the Nebraska side took
refuge in trees and were taken off in
VKi I MILLION. S. D., April 21.â The
Hood situation is far worse to-night
than at any time this week and the
Missouri River has risen two inches in
five hours. Stock left on farms be
tween the Missouri and Vermillion
rivers cannot now be taken off. At
Bu-bank cattle are reported to. be
drowned. From VcrmiHirm for fifteen
miles west toward Yankton and eight

PRICE HEIRS MUST PAY
THE DE FOREST CLAIM
HACKENSACK, N. J.. April 21.â State
Senator Winton received advices 'from
"Washington to-day to the effect that the
Supreme Court in the case
of Cornier Governor Hodman M. Price's
â  would be against the heirs and that
: mure than forty years of litigation
the case was finally settled, except the en
tering of the decree.
Rodman M. 'rice was Governor of New
Jersey early in the fifties. He had been a
resident of California in the days preced
ing the discovery of gold. He was inter
ested in California property and was in
the service of the navy. He took an ac
tive part in the incidents attending the
transfer of the Pacific Coast to the United
Statesâ active, it seems, for he left
the management of his duties as paymas
ter to subordinates, and one day he was
stunned to find a clerk missing: and the
Government funds $75,000 short. Mr. Price
paid this amount to the Government to
settle his accounts.
While in California Mr. Price became
interested with Samuel do Forest In real
estate. De Forest came East and lift
his interests in charge of Price. The
Navy Department ordered Price to come
East and ho left the management of his
own and De Forest's property in care of
a man named Keyes. This man sold the.
properties and always said he paid to Dp
Forest his share of the money, but De
Forest showed he did not. De Forest then
sued Price for the account of Keyes and
obtained judgmerft in this State. Mean
while Price had got out of the navy, was
elected Governor and was a prominent
man for years.
In 1892 Congress passed a billl. which
was approved by the President reimburs
ing Price for the defalcation of the clerk
De Forest had kept his judgment alive
and when the bill was a law he tried to
enforce the payment of the money to
him- But Prfce fought the ease. Mean
while $.0,000 remained undrawn and does
to this day. ' â¢ /
When Mr. Price died his heirs refused
to pay the judgment or part of it with
the 170,000, contending it came under the
same head as pension money, which is
free from the attacks of creditors. Now
comes word that the court of final resort
has decided the money does not come un
dr t lie head of pensions and is not un
attachable.

BABY KIDNAPED BY
AN INTOXICATED MAN
LOS ANGKLES, April 21.â The freak of
a drunken man caused consternation in
the h>>me of Abel Le Brun on Boyle
Heights. Le Brun was forced to do some
rapid detective work in order to find his
baby, which the Intoxicated man kid
naped.
The Le Bruns live at the corner of St.
T.'iuis street and Brooklyn avenue. Until
rday Mrs. Le Brun hns been at the
detention hospital. During her absence
her nine-year-old-daughter has been car
ing fur the babe. <m Tuesday th<' little
pirl was carrying the baby near the Le
Brun home. A drunken man reeling along
saw the baby and was seized with a d( -
Sire to carry it away.
"Give me the baby," he demanded,
thickly.
Thr- ohild was so frightened that she
complied with the demand, and Hi.
drunken man went down the street with
the baby in his arms. As soon as the jjirl
recovered from her fright she told her
father what had happened. He was soon
on the trail of the kidnaper. When hi
overtook the drunken man the baby was
turned over with a maudlin apology. Le
Brun forgave the drunkard in his joy at
recovering the baby, and hereafter a close
watch will be kept on the infant.

The character and quality of the meat, re
frigerated and canned, furnished to the army;
how purchased; how shipped to the soldiers; If
good when shipped; what the cause of its de
terioration. If any. If the meat was doctored,
did the Commissary General or any of his
officers have any knowledge of it, or means of
knowing? "Was it the meat of commerce? was
it inspected by the Government inspectors as
provided by law? Was It an authorized ration
in the army? If good when purchased, what
made it bad? Was it anybody's neglect or
fault, and If so. whose? When unfit for use. if
you should so find, was the fact made known
to the War Department; when and by whom?
If after leaving the depot commissary it was
not cared for and properly preserved, whose
fault? Was it a suitable ration for the cam
paigns In Cuba and Porto Rico? Was there
anything better that was practicable? Would
it have been prudent for our troops to have
made the expedition to Santiago and Porto
Rico without the preserved meats, either re
frigerated or canned, with which they were
supplied? Could the army with any certainty
rely upon the cattle on the hoof :on those
Islands? Did the commanding officers in San
tlapo or Porto Rico or the major general com
manding report during the war that either the
refrigerated or canned beef was an unfit ra
tion? When v^e these reports first made, and
by whom? If the allegations of the major gen
eral commanding are established, I want the
court to find the cause and fix the responsi
bility for the fact, that the guilty may be
properly punished. Did the cattle in Porto
Rico make a wholesome ration? If the packers
of the country are guilty It must be known. If
the officers of the Commissary Department are
guilty It must be known. If any officer of the
army is guilty it must be known.
Both Major Lee and Colonel Davis sub
mitted a number of reports and a mass
of correspondence. Among the docu
ments read by Colonel Davis was a let
ter from the Washington attorneys
of Armour & Co.. dated June 15, 1888, after
the contract for beef had been let, asking
for a reconsideration of the subject in
the interest of their clients and an in- 1
dorsement by General Egan as commis
sary general opposing the request. In
their letter the attorneys represented that
the Armours controlled the Powell pro
cess for the treatment of meat, and that
this fact gave them such an advantage in
the preservation of fresh beef as to jus
tify the War Department in disregarding
the difference in price and awarding them
the contract. In his indorsement General
Eagan referred to the letter of the ! at
torneys as a "special pleading," and said
there was "no reason in this plea why the
subject should be reopened. The tests
made by Armour & Co. are not the only
tests that have been made." he said, "and
there Is no doubt whatever in my .mind
but that, the; beef , can be furnished as re
quired. â  â  I ;ij â â  }'â  t
This document was introduced by
Colonel Davis to show that General
Eagan- had not been Influenced by the
representations concerning the Powell

HOW DICK CROKER
HELD UP ONE NEW
YORK GAS COMPANY
NEW YORK, April 21.â Two exciting
ons of the Mazet Investigating com
mittee were held to-day. A feature was
the refusal of the witnesses to give tes
timony. 'Another feature was the defiant
attitude of Andrew Freedman on the
stand, and still another feature the ejec
tion from the committee room of Abra
ham Himmet "Wright of the Roebling
Company when he insisted upon making
a statement after he had refused to. an
s\\ir a great majority of the questions
put to him by Mr. Moss, counsel for the
committee.
The chief interest centered in Andrew
Freedman, who within recent years baa
been known ;is a warm personal friend
of Mr. Croker and associated with him
in a busin< bs way. Mr. Freedman was
more than ordinarily forcible in his an
swers to some of the questions, md
many of the questions he refused to an
awer at all. At other times he was re
buked by both Mr. Moss and Chairman
Mazet for what they termed "imperti
nence."
After Mr. Frcedman's examination had
progressed to a certain point and the
witness had refused several times to an
swer a question which he deemed a "per
sonal matter," Mr. Moss excused him for
the day. Mr. Freedman then got down
from the stand, and, turning to the news
paper reporters, he handed them a pa
per, saying, "Gentlemen of the press,
here is a statement of the entire busi
ness of the Platt Company and Allen
Companies for publication."
Ilrnrv M. McDonald, the nominee of the
Chicago platform Democracy for Governor at
the last State election, was the first wit-
"Have you any knowledge connected with
the nffaira of the Flushing Gas Company?"
McDonald stated that he had. He stated
that William X Burnett, a director of that
u'n-> company, was an associate of hi?, and
from him he' learned various facts. McDonald
â aid that the gas company was reorganized In
',!,.. beginning of isss, and that Henry J.
a member of the Democratic Club, and
the present owner of the Democratic Club
building and another man purchased the first
mortgage bonds of the company and were
made director*. Soon after this, McDonald
said, the Flushing Company endeavored to ob
tain Â» contract from New York City, under
ftdmlnlstrati I or Van JVyek, but waÂ«
unsuccessful, ( vintlnuing, McDonald said:
"Finally It wa? arranged by Mr. Brawer with
Mr. <'roker that the stockholders of the com
pany stfould turn ovpr to Andrew Freedman
S3 per cent n f the stock of the company, to
be Held for the benefit of Mr. Croker and. Mr.
"This itbcK was contributed hy the different
stocknolders pro rata, and was Issued to Mr.
â ran. Thereupon Mr. Freedman was
i a member of tliÂ» board of directors.
The agreement <>n the part of Mr. Crokfr
> , i--;. edmah was that as so in a p *sible
the company would receive a contract for at
least i'X> additional lights, possibly 1(X)O addi
tional lirhts. Now i- to whether Mr. Croker
had carried out his contract or not, I don"t
know."
Andrew Freedroan was cnllfl. He held
f.U.'-k in the Flushing OÂ«S Company, but re
fused to StaJ int, â â !Â» tli" ground that
it was a personal matter. He denied that
after he wni Into the company it was allowed
to supply gas to light more lamps in Flush-
Ing. "We an," Paid the witness, "supplying
less now than previous t'i my going Into the
company." Mr. ("roker, he said, knew noth
ing whatsoever about his holding stock in the
company. Mr. Freedman said he was con
nected with the United States Fidelity Guar
anty- Company. He snid he had nothing to
do with politics. Mr. Croker had ne\.
listed him in getting stock in any corporation
unless Me himself bad paid for it. He had
paid for every <!n]|nr's worth of stork he
owned. Mr. Croker had paid ror tne stock he
owned in the Fidelity and Guarantee Cona
S. Armstrong, president of the Arm
strong Parking Company of Pallas. Tex.,
which, among other things, set forth the
substance of a conversation with General
Eagan. Mr. Armstrong was one of the
bidders for beef on block and said that
while he was here in Washington hrÂ» dis
cussed with General Eagan the question
of beef being k<pt for Beventy-tWO hours
after being taken from tho refrigerator.
Mr. Armstrong said he expressed the
opinion that it was impossible, to which
General Eagan replied that Swift <fc Co.
and Armour both had knowledge of a pro
cess by which beef could be kept for that
length of time.

Yellow Fever at Havana.
HAVANA, April 21. â Two new cases of
yellow fever developed In Havana to-day,
making five officially reported. There are
no Americans among them, and as far as
is known at the office of the chief surgeon

Government Buys Seeds.
SAX JOStO. April 21.â Charles Parker of
Santa Clara was notified to-day that he
had received the annual Government con
tract for seeds, his bid being $64,900. The
seeds to be forwarded will amount to
twenty-two carloads and will include sev
eral carionds of sweet peas and other
flower seeds.
i pnny. Mr. Freedman refused to answer wheth
j er this was a rate war between his company
and the other company, on the ground that
the question was not pertinent to the investi
gation.
Chairman Mazet Instructed him to answer,
but Mr. Freedman refused. Mr. Freedman
testified that his bond company had paid no
dividend. Mr. Moss drew Mr. Freedman's at
tention to the testimony of Mr. Croker, who
stated before the committee that he got divi
dends regularly from the United States Fidel
ity and Guarantee Company. Mr. Freedman
said be could explain that very easily. As
, manager of the company he had a salary and
j commission, besides owning stock. He divided
his salary and commission with Mr. Croker,
according to previous agreement. There was
no contract- for such an arrangement. "Mr.
Croker relies upon my word," said Mr. Freed
man. The witness refused to tell the exact
1 nature of the agreement he had made with Mr.
Croker. Witness was very anxious to have Mr.
Croker's friendship and association in this
company, "on account of the legion of friends
that ho has all over this country."
Moss wormed out of Mr. Freedman that the
profits he divided with Mr. Croker were "most
ly from bonding."
Chairman Mazet said: "There is a discrepancy
between your testimony and Mr. Croker's. If
you care to have the record stand as it is the
commission Is satisfied."
Freedman averred that It had been "ex
plained sufficiently."
Frank A. Bell, who is employed In the de
partment of taxes and assessments, and who
has brought with him the tax book of the city
of New York, at the request of the committee,
was called to testify to the value of Richard
Croker's house on Seventy-fourth street. Ex
amination brought out the fact that the valua
tion of Mr. Croker's house had been decreased
by the Assessors $1000 since ISOB.
Moss called Abraham Himmel Wright of the
Roebling Construction Company. Mr. Moss
asked if the treasurer of the Roebling Com
pany attended the office of the company regu
larly every day. Mr. Himmel Wright said he
thought that a matter of private business, and
Mr. Mos3 retorted: "I am sorry to Bee a man

FIRST AMERICAN
CENSUS OF HAWAII
Preliminary Work Has
Commenced.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Headquarters, "Wellington Hotel,
Washington, April 21.
The first American census of Hawaii
will be one of the features of the pres
ent administration of the Census Bu
reau. Preliminary work has already
begun. Government officials in the Ha
waiian Islands have been communi
cated with in reference to the appoint
ment of a supervisor. This official will
be an American resident of the islands,
and it is understood the enumerators,
over whom he will have supervision,
will be natives.
It is the understanding of the offi
cers of the census that the population
of the islands is approximately 110.000.
divided among the different races as
follows: Â , onnnn.
Hawaiian* and mixed blood, 3^000;
Japanese, 25,000;' Chinese. 21.o00; Portu
guese, 15,000; Americans, 4000; British,
2250; Germans and other Europeans,
2000; Polynesians and miscellaneous,
12 These people are distributed among
the islands as follows: Hawaii, 33,250.
Maui, 17,726; Oahu, 40,205; Kauai, 15.2-8.
Molokai. 2307; Lanai, 105; Niihau, 164.
One of the interesting features of the
Hawaiian census will be the enumera
tion of lepers. It is presumed that not
all the lepers have been isolated and
the census will seek.to develop accurate
and reliable information concerning the
status of the disease. ,â,Â«.âÂ«,
One of the aims of the insular census
will be to gather statistics as to il
literacy in the islands. The census will
show. a great deal of valuable matter
concerning trade and commerce of the
islands. At present the islands grow
export and sell more than $10,000,000
worth of produce annually.
It is the belief among those who pre
side over the census that the commerce
of these islands will eventually assume
vast proportions. The exports of sugar
from Hawaii in 1896 amounted in value
to $14,932,172, while all other exports to
gether, including rice, coffee, bananas,
wool, hides and pineapples, only
amounted to $583,053.

SAYS MRS. FRYE
WHS TOO HASTY
Dr. Jordan Sets Himself
Aright.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, April 21.
In an interview to-day Dr. Jordan de
nied he had ever spoken slightingly of
the Peace Commission, and remarked
that if Mrs. Frye had followed the
usual method of ascertaining facts she
would have found no reason for a pub
lic discussion.
"The story," said Dr. Jordan, "which
I told to the students of the Stockton
High School criticizing the manners of
an American agent at a banquet in
Taris pertained to an incident occurring
In ISO:'. No mention of the Peace Com
mission was made. The story which
was erroneously reported on the 25th of
February was corrected the following
day in all the papers, over my signa
ture."
The story told at Stockton related to
an American agf-nt who was chewing
tobacco at a Parisian banquet. When
he called for a cuspidor the -waiter
brought the article and placed it on
the' table beside his plate.
After reading Mrs. Frey's published
letter of criti'Msm this morning, Dr.
Jordon sent the following telegram to
Mrs. Frye:
"Referring to the Boston telegram of
Associated Press, permit me to say that
at Stockton I made no attack on the
administration, and did not m.
the Peace Commission or any member
by name or implication. The incident
related happened several years ago,
and was connected with the Pi
Commission by the assumption of
reporter. I corrected it at that
in all the papers s copying it. I
never uttered one word criticizing the
personnel of the commission. I reerpt
deeply the whole affair, especia ;. that

Special P!?patch to The Call.
NILES, April 21.â Last Saturday, at
S o'clock in the evening, a Chinaman

B. Harnard. The others. walked down
railroad track in the direction of
Jose. At the stable a two-horse
â  : rig was hired by the men.
Mr. Barnard was not suspicious when
told him they did not expect to be
back before Sunday, and let them have
the team. They drove off, and at the
bridge picked up the other two Chi
â¢
They left Xiles at 4:30 o'clock and
just had time to got to San Jos^ when
the murder was committed there. Sun
day came and went, but the team had
not been returned. on Monday Barn
ard drove to San Jose to trace them.
He foun 1 a trace of them at Miluitas
and learned that the four men had
gone oh to San Jose. They wore l'>st
in the maze of the San Jose Chinatown.
Constable Roderick has been hunting
them to get the rig back, but with no
success.
The supposition is that the four men
committed the San Jose murder and
then went on to Fresno, which city
they had ample time to reach in tiny
to assist in the murders there. Officer
Roderick left this morning for the
south to try and get some clew of
them.
This promises to be an important
clew that may lead to the arrest of the
highbinders, Barnard has given a v< in

of having them caught. The Chinese'
were dressed in American clothes of

Bwore that he had killed Leong Tung
and that Wong Duck, who Is charged
with the crime, i? innocent. Rapilji is
j ed by the Chinese companies as
(da! watchman to guard their

prise to the District Attorney as Ra- i
pelji, although he had arrested Wong
Duck himself and claimed on the night
of the Bhooting that Wong Duck had
deliberately shot Leong Tung, yester

mony nothing new was brought
The inquest was completed at 1 o'clock.
Hop Lee. who, it is alleged, is the
leader of the local highbinders, was re
leased from jail last night on $500
bonds. Since Hop Lee has been liber
ated a number of merchants in China
town have left here for San Francisco
or other points for fear of another out

men who they claim are on the way
from San FVancisco.
ATTACHED THEIR NAMES
TO WORTHLESS DRAFTS
TACOMA. April 21.â British Vice Con
sul Alexander and other business men
here have been defrauded of hundreds of
dollars through the shady transactions of
Captain W. H. Smith and Charles G.
Cnrruthers. These men attained promi
nence at Eagle City, Alaska, last fall
through townsite boom schemes and
were requested to leave on short notice
by the miners of that town. They came
to Puget Sound in February- In Tacoma
they widely advertised that they could
cheaply and quickly raise the ' sunken
ship Andelana. They were to make large
profits out of this enterprise. On the
strength of this expectation they ran up
bills here and in Seattle.
Vice Consul Alexander indorsed one of
their rtrafts for $400, which wan cashed
through a local bank and sent thence to
San I- rancisco for collection. â  It was re
turned unpaid. This draff was drawn by
tamlth on Moses Samuels of 134 First
street. San Francisco. It is not known
here whether Samuels is a real or a fir
titious person. Mr. Alexander will make
his Indorsement good, but he cannot pro
ceed against Carruthers and Smith be
cause the cashing of worthless drafts is
I Y'. t !l c rlm 'n'il offense under the laws of
this State.
John Sorertson. a prominent diver, who
wa 5 ',' h c eha f r^ e of the raising of the
Andelana, was given another draft drawn
on Samuels for $30. It was shea at the
Donnelly Hotel, but Sorenson will stand
the loss. Among other victims of Smith
and Carruthers were the Donnelly Hotel
here and the Pacific Clothing House of
Seattle. Smith and Carruthers Tare re
ported to be at Republic.

UNITED STATES SENATOR
"I " T ARRISBURG, Pa., April 21.â 1 - |
_ mediately on receipt of the news '
that Mr. Quay was acquitted of
. * A. the charges against him Gover
nor Stone appointed him L T nited
States Senator to fill the vacancy until I
the next Legislature meets, and notified
Vice President Hobart as follows:
Sir: By virtue of the power vested in
me as executive of the State of Perm-
Bylvania under article 1, clause 2, section j
'i. of the constitution of the United States .
I hereby makt- temporary appointment
of the Hon. Matthew Stanley Quay to be (
United States Senator from Pennsylvania
until the next meeting of the Pennsyl
vania Legislature, to till the vacancy now ;
existing in this State. Very respectfully,
WILLIAM A." STONE,
Governor of Pennsylvania.
Governor Stone said that in appoint
ing Senator Quay he felt that he had
done the fit and proper thing. He
thought it would make the Issue and is
better done now than after waiting for
weeks.
The authority quoted by the Gover
. nor says that the Governor of any State
may make temporary appointments
during a recess to hold until the next
Legislature meets.
WASHINGTON, April 21.â Opinions dif
fer as to whether the Senate will admit
'.y>:\y to a seat "11 th>' appointment "f the
<">ovfrnor of Pennsylvania. It is in the
power of each Senate to interpret the law
tor itself, and a majority could se&t
him. This might come about through a
deal being made in connection with other
vacancies. If precedents werÂ« j overturned
it would open the way for the filling of
vacancies, which would give the Repub
licans three Senators and the Democrats
one, which they otherwise would not
have. In view of this, political methods
might obtain above the strict construe
; t ion of th. law and danger of endless
complications in the future. It would
follow, too, that the Governor of Califor
nia and the Governor of Delaware might
appoint Senators \v!i<> would be seated.
On general grounds such a change of
position or! th<> part of the Senate would
Involve complications in the future which
; it is believed a majority of the Senate
would hesitate to incur. It is pointed out.
furthermore, that in the case of Mr.
Quay the constitution of Pennsylvania
ts a barrier in addition to that of
the construction of the law by the Senate
In several cases. The constitution of
Pennsylvania prohibits the Governor from
making appointments to the Senate.
The United States Senate in the cases
of Mantle of Montana and others held
to the theory that a Governor could not
appoint when the Legislature, being in
51 si. ,n after the vacancy had occurred.
had failed to elect. Mr. Quay was one
of those who voted to sustain this theory.
The chances are that no serious effort
will be made to scat Mr. Quay, on the
strength of tho Governor's appointment,
but that an extra session of the Legis
lature will be called and an effort be made
to elect him. Mis friends think this will
succeed, now that he has been acquitted.

OWENS PENITENT
ON THE GALLOWS
Murderer Calmly Meets
His Death.
Fpecla! Dispatch to The Call.
SAN QUENTIN, April 21.â"Gentle
men, I will soon step to my everlasting
home. I killed my wife, a woman that
I loved, and that love will go with me
to the grave. I was not in my right
mind when I took my wife's life. I
was not responsible for it, -and my Go<i
in heaven knows it. Good-by."
George C. Owens, the Modesto wife
murderer. stood or. the death trap at
San Quentin Prison this morning and
uttered these words slowly and in a
firm tone. There was just the sus
picion of a tremor in the voice of the
murderer after the word "gentlemen,"
hut he gathered himself together quick
ly and went on. Five seconds after the
last word left his lips he hung at the
ond of a rope and his mental agony
was over.
Owens' demeanor was a great sur
prise to the prison officials. For the
last week the condemned man has done
little else than weep and it was be
lieved that he would collapse on the
gallows. Under the religious ministra
tion of Rev. Father Lagan of San Ra
fael, Owens braced up wonderfully this
morning and he followed the priest
upon the scaffold with a firm step.
Father Lagan informed the large num
ber of persons present that Owens de
sired to speak a few words, and after
one brief glance at Hangman Arbogast,
who stood by with the noose in his
hand, the doomed man spoke the words
given above.
Dr. Lawlor, the prison physician, said
Owens' death was the quickest he had
ever witnessed. The drop fell at 10:34Vfe
and respiration ceased with the fall.
There was not a pulse beat after the
first half of the third minute. The
body was cut down in eleven and a half
minutes and taken to San Rafael for
interment in the Catholic cemetery.
The crime for which Owens paid the
death penalty was the murder of his
wife at Modesto, on December 13, 1897.
A few months previously they had
trouble over the wife championing the
cause of their daughter, who desired
to marry a blacksmith named Tiede
mann. The wedding took place and
then the wife went to live with her
daughter and son-in-law. When the
wife began divorce proceedings Owens
grew infuriated, and, going to his
daughter's house, shot Mrs. Owens
twice and wounded his daughter. The
wife died a few days later. Owens
turned the revolver on himself after
the commission of the crime, but
wounded himself only slightly. He was
found guilty of murder and sentenced
to be hanged. An appeal was taken to
the State Supreme Court and the case
dragged along for two years. The Su
preme Court finally affirmed the verdict
of the lower court.

WANAMAKER TALKS OF
QUAY'S ALLEGED MISDEEDS
PHILADELPHIA, April 21.â John Wan
amaker made the following statement
relative to the acquittal of ex-Senator
OLIVER BELMONT
AND BRYAN TALK
Democratic Powwow at
Buffalo.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
BUFFALO. April 21.â Fully 8000 people
crowded Music Hall to-night to listen to
Colonel W. J. Bryan. Among those in
the boxes were Mayor Conrad Diehl
and Vicar General Connery of the dio
cese of Buffalo.
Colonei Bryan- appeared on the stage at
8:25 o'clock, accompanied by a large com
pany. He was enthusiastically received,
the crowd rising and cheering for some
time. Among, those on the platform were
Frank L. Bapst, chairman of the Demo
cratic committee; Norman K. Mack, Su
preme Court Justice .Robert G. Thus ajid
Oliver H. f. .tseimont.
Justice Tims presided. He .spoke
against territorial expansion and urged
the Democratic party to piant itself
squarely in opposition to that heresy. Tne
cuairmun theu introduced Mr. iielmont.
Who was received with hearty applause.
He said in part:
The Democratic party holds a great responsi
bility toward the people. It remains witn it
to ueelde whether existing conditions shall con
tinue or not. The party ha:s never been given
greater opportunity to vindicate Its claim that
it is the party that stands lor government by
the people and for the people, with equal rights
to all and special privileges to none.
The responsibility of the Democratic party is
doubled trotn the fact that if It mils to oust
the enemy in XXX) It will by so doing give it
a long lease for the seat of government and
allow it to intrench its position by the intricate
system of patronage. 'â¢.;.'
"1 am a believer in Democratic principles, and
I believe that the minority should acquiesce in
the decision of the majority, but I believe that
the interest of any city, ' State or section of
the country should be used in framing a na
tional policy. The city of New York is Demo
cratic, and I can say the State,, though we were
beaten In the last election, is also Democratic,
and its vote will be essential in the 'election
of 1900.
I deem it, therefore, urgent that eveÂ«y
Democrat of New York should rally to his
party and give assurance of bis support to the
next national platform, whether It will be that
of 18iÂ»6 pure and simple, or whether it will be
that Of IM>6 modified or added to.
The Republicans, as expr-'sseii by this admin
istration, gtftnd for trusts, monopolies and con
centrated wealth ami imperialism, and to all
of th.-se things I hold Democracy Is opposed.
I am not opposed to wealthâ no one would
believe mp If I pretended to beâ but I am op
posed to trusts an'l monopolies, because 1 con-
Blder they Interfere with Individual effort,
which has made thr American citizen what he
Isâ a free and independent man. I deny in
â¢â very way the idea that the Democratic party
Is opposed U) wealth, as our Republican friends
pretend. Wealth Is as safe In Democratic hands
as It Is In Republican hands, but the right
of the Individual to secure wealth will be
safer under a Democratic administration.
Justice Titus paid a high tribute to
Colonel Bryan, who was received with tre
mendous cheering.
Mr. Bryan said he had been accused of
not having worldly goods sufficient to
make him a safe custodian of property,
but he was glad that the one who preced
ed him (Mr. Belmont) had enough worldly
possessions to take him out of the ranks
of the anarchists at least.
Continuing. iMr. Bryan spoke against
expansion, against the taxing of the peo
ple to maintain a large standing army
and against the manner of raising the
war revenue, and closed with an argument
for bimetallism. His speech was largely
a repetition of his address delivered in
New York at the "dollar dinner."
Hobart Gains Slowly.
WASHINGTON, April 21.â Vice Presi
dent Hobart had a fairly good day, and
was able to sit up several times. His
progress toward recovery is very tedious,
but the physicians are confident he is

Quay and the latter's appointment by
the Governor as United States Senator:
The acquittal of Senator Quay will be a dis
appointment to every lover of justice and every
friend of good government throughout the
I'nited States. It records with emphasis the
difficulty of convicting potent politicians
charged with public crime, no matter how
clear, convincing and overwhelming the evi
dence may be. The story of the corrupt use and
speculation in public money in Pennsylvania is
*n old one and has been a matter of notorious
accusation against a long line of State Treas
urers and political bosses for many years. Mr.
3uay himself has heen again and again accused
â )( participation in treasury jobbing by the
newspapers of this and other States. Hereto
fore, however, the basis of these accusations
largely consisted of oral testimony and of alle
gations by political opponents. TÂ»he case which
Lerminated to-day, unlike previous accusations,
was founded exclusively upon documentary
proof in his own handwriting and that of his
friends and confederates. The evidence of the
juilt did not depend upon the veracity of any
man or men, but was supported exclusively
t>y his own letters and by written entries and
=tatements recorded by his trusted friends and
supporters. From the day the prosecution
igalnst him was instituted until the verdict
nas recorded he has sought by every device 'to
ielay and obstruct the efforts of the common
wealth's officers to produce the written evi
dence of his misdoing and to bring him to
trial for his offenses. The removal of the case
from the lower court on the eve of the day
when it was first set down for trial by an
extraordinary writ issued by the Supreme
Court, which that court subsequently dis
missed, was successful in taking the prosecu
tion away from the management of former
restrict Attorney Graham, whose ability, zeal
md effectiveness as a prosecutor had been de
monstrated by eighteen years of service. The
same effort to prevent a full exposition of his
icts as a public official and his connection with
the private use of public money marked avery
"tcp in the extraordinary line of defense which
his skillful attorneys adopted during his trial
in resisting the zealous and able efforts of
District Attorney Rothermel to Introduce all
the inculpating evidence in possession of the
commonwealth. By technical objection he ex
cluded the evidence offered to show that dur
ng his term as State Treasurer he was paid In
terest on State deposits and also the receipt
)f interest by subsequent Treasurers charged in
the bill of indictments as being, conspirators
with him in crime, and finally failed to take
the stand in his own defense ..nd submit him
self to cross-examination upon the charge
made. The "red book" ker>t by his trusted
friend, Mr.. Hopkins, and which set out the
=tory "f treasury corruptions, was overwhelm
ingly corroborated and its verity established by
the testimony and admission of his friend.
McKep and by the signature of his friend and
co-defendant, B J. Ettywood. Notwithstand
ing all this proof, ematiating exclusively fron:
the llns and pens of himself and his closest
rriends, and in the face of his own silence and
failure to testify to his innocence, he was ac
nuitted.
This is a new chapter of shame for Pennsyl
vania, a new record of failure in the admin
istration of Justice that will do much to en
courage corruptionists and public plunderers
generally throughout the country. The first
shout of defiant exultation over his acquittal
has proceeded from the Governor of the com
monwealth, who lias promptly appointed him a
L'nlted States Senator without authority and
In violation of the law and In defiance of th>>
will of the people as expressed by the votes of
the Legislature. It is fitting in every way
that the capstonp should have thus been put
upon the edifjfre of boss rule and machine job
bery by the Quay representative in the Gov
ernor's chair. We will thus see more clearly,
it is to be hoped, the reckless disregard of right
and decency, of public morality and political
purity that characterizes the Quay machine
now intrenched In office In Pennsylvania.
But friends of Â£-00,1 government .should not
jcppalr. There are other indictments to be dis
posed of still hanging over Quay, and whatever
may be their fate, even though it should be a
technical acquittal, the contest against the
ling forces, practices and principles
which Quay and his machine represent will be
carried on until justice and right, morality and
honesty, r hall trlum;>h. The friends of good
g. >\ t.-rnment will enlist in this warfare to-day
and must continue unremittingly and unflinch
ingly the strife against all wrongdoing and
wrongdoers in any party and in all parties, re
gardless of temporary setbacks or defeats, un
til the treasury johbers shnll be driven from
official power in the commonwealth. To-day's
verdict settles nothing but the fate of the
single bill of Indictment upon which Quay was
tried.
WILL ORDER HIS
ARMY TO DISBAND
Gomez to Bring Peace
to Cuba.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
HAVANA, April 21.â General Max
imo Gomez is arranging to publish to
morrow a list of paymasters and as
sistant paymasters appointed ata meet
ing held this evening. He will say in
connection therewith, that owing to
the necessity of the establishment of
a peaceful republic at the earliest pos
sible date, the only troops needed are
those of the intervening power, with
the assistance of the rural guards in
isolated districts. Therefore he will
instruct soldiers of the Cuban army to
disband and turn over their arms to
their officers, who will deposit them in
a suitable rAeptaele or museum where
they will be guarded as relics of a
glorious struggle. The men are then
to go to work immediately.
Officials close to Gomez say that if
he were offered the Presidency he prob
ably would accept.
La Discusion attacks him to-day
saying he is not a representative of the
army or the people and that he was
elected by only a. few generals, "who
were forced to do so by the tyrannical
Americans."
Gomez was subjected to an affront
yesterday while he was returning in a
launch after having said farewell to his
two sons and his daughter, who sailed
for San Domingo. General Gomez was
hissed by some people who were stand
ing on the roof of a house that over
looked the harbor. They waved Span
ish flags, cried "Long live Weyler," and
"Long live Spain," "Death to Gomez,"
"Death to the Americans," and "Death
to the Cubans." The passengers and
sailors on board the Alfonso XIII re
peated the cries. Even the papers that
oppose Gomez denounce the proceeding
as an outrage.
ESTERHAZY A SPY FOR
THE INTELLIGENCE BUREAU
PARTS. April 21.â The Figaro, continu
ing to-day its publication of the testimony
given before the Court of Cassation in
the Dreyfus revision inquiry, prints the
depositions of a host of experts on hand
writing, with conflicting opinions as to
the authorship of the bordereau. Most of
these are of little interest.
M. Chincolle, a journalist, testified that
during an adjournment of the Zola trial
he overheard Esterhazy admit that he
(Esterhazy) wrote the bordereau by or
der, adding: "General Billot's meanness
is well known; and if he had given me
(Esterhazy) 80,000 francs in the course of
a twelvemonth it was not for nothing."
From this M. Chincolle concluded that
Esterhazy had long rendered police ser
vices to the intelligence bureau. â¢

Healer Schlatter Shows
Up at Boston.
TELLS A PECULIAR STORY
DESCRIBES A VISIT TO THE
REALMS ABOVE.
He Was Commissioned, He Declares,
to Return to Earth and Utilize
the Divine Power He
Possessed.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
BOSTON, April 21.â Schlatter, the "di
vine healer," is in Boston. He says he
has come to make the blind see. the lame
walk and the sick recover. Schlatter Is
not the "healer's" real name, nor does he
go by that appellation. He is the Rev.
Charles McLean. M. D., who, according
to his own lips, is the Schlatter of fame.
Schlatter is the German for "sleeper."
and the name was given him, he says, by
the Germans of Denver, Colo. In every
detail 'does he tally with the description
of the famous "healer" who went into a
Western desert in 1896, after several fail
ures to continue his wonderful cures.
From the day when Schlatter dropped
from sight, to bury himself for forty days,
people have disputed his death and
"resurrection." The bones of a man sup
posed to be Schlatter were found on a
Western desert, but Dr. McLean, in an
interview yesterday, said that when he
buried himself his soul visited God. His
body was "under the earth of the barren
soil"â the spot he will not reveal. The
soul, he says, was "instructed by God to
come back to earth, join the waiting
body, for both to rise up, go the path
formerly trod, and on the way utilize di
vine powers for the benefit of mankind."
Schlatter has consulted certain city au
thorities as to his desire to bury himself
for forty days in this city with the per
mission of the Board of Health, his grave
to be watched by persons in authority
and members of the press and others who
may join. He does not stipulate how deep
he shall be buried, but says sixty feet
is agreeable to him. His sole purpose is
to convince the unbelieving that he is "a
chosen representative of God alive."
He makes the claim that by his powers
Rudyard Kipling was saved when every
one else gave him up. While the eyes of
the world were watching for bulletins
of the author"s death and the doctors
labored without hope, Dr. McLean says,
he was called upon by an intimtae friend
of Mrs. Kipling.
"1 was implored by this woman." he
told a reporter, "to save Mr. Kipling if
it were -in my power. I asked God to
grant the woman the request as she had
faith in my powers. Mrs*. Kipling, I was
told, knew or the other woman's request.
The world knows that Kipling was saved
as if by a hand stretched out by God. It
was God's hand, in truth, that saved him.
"This knowledge," he continued, "was
not intended for the public. Up to a few
years ago 1 never used the extraordinary
powers God gave me to any extent. You
all know of my cures in Denver and the
crowds that visited me. One day I found
my power to cure the sick and make the
blind see and the lame walk had left me.
I had thirty failures in one day. I be
lieved T â  had offended God in some way
and I aaid to him, 'I will do penance.' I
went into the desert to bury myself and
fast for forty days. I did so, and when I
lay buried for a few hours God command
ed' my soul to come to him. I saw God
and told him I felt that I had offended
him. He said this was not so, but that
he desired I should rest. "You shall go
back again and continue your work,' he
said."
The reporter asked how heaven looked.
"That is sealed on my lips." he an
swered. "God will not allow me to say
what I saw or what he told me. I am
like Paulâ 'l saw, but cannot tell.' I
stayed in heaven for forty days and got
thoroughly rested. Then God commanded
me to return. My soul joined my body in
the desert grave. I rose up and started
on my renewed mission."
"Where is the grave?"
"That I cannot tell."
"But there were bones found on a
western plain, near Denver?"
"Yea, but they were the bones of some
unfortunate."
"How does God look?"
"He Is not in form or shape, and Is visi
ble to the senses only."
"To what influence do you ascribe your
wonderful powers?"
"That I do not know. God selected me
as his disciple on earth and told me to go
and give aid to the deserving-."
"What were the most wonderful cures
you have made?"
"Bringing two persons to life. In IRS6 I
was in London. Behind Dr. Spurgeon's
Tabernacle a man named James Gibson
lay in a trance, but he was in reality
dead, physicians and medical men failing
to bring him to life. I succeeded by lay
ing my hands on him and praying. The
other case was of a woman named Helen
McCollâ a Scotch woman. She was dead
for a day, the death certificate being is
sued."
"I have been offered $1,000,000 by Armour
to build a temple with. Andrew Carnegie
has made a similar offer, and so have nu
merous other rich men. They all had
some selfish purpose. They wanted the
temple named after them, or in some
other way they were to gain distinction
by their gifts. Because of this I refused.
Andrew Carnegie is an example of this
money-giving class. They must reap
some benefit."
While in New York the divine healer
ruired Richard Croker of two diseases that
had baffled the skill of the best New York
physicians. Croker. he says, admits this.
The cure was performed at the request
of Mrs. Croker. Mr. Croker gave him
$5000. the use of Tammany Hall, and Tam
many Hall gave $10,<X>0.
GHOULISH COMPETITION
OF THE UNDERTAKERS
Death of J. D. Brooks at Los Angeles
Closes a Disgusting
Incident.
LOS ANGELES, April 21.â The scandal
ous efforts of certain undertaking firms
to secure a "shipping job" in the case of
an invalid tourist not yet dead were in
creased to-day, when J. D. Brooks, the
unfortunate whose case was noted in
previous dispatches, passed away. Mr
Brooks was for many years head clerk
for the Carnegie Steel Company and was
paid a large salary. It is said an ac
quaintance of the sufferer several days
ago went to a firm of undertakers and
promised them the job of embalming and
preparing the remains for Eastern ship
ment when death should have come. The
Carnegie firm a few days ago sent $200
here to defray the funeral expenses and
the fare East of an acquaintance who
intended to accompany ihe body.
The local council of the Royal Arcanum,
an order to which Mr. Brooks belonged,
had, however, decided on other arrange
ments. When the invalid died this morn
ing an officer of the lodge telephoned to
an undertaking firm to take charge of the
body. The firm immediately sent a wagon
and representatives of two other establish
ments who hoped to get the case passed up
stairs just as the corpse was being taken
away. Wrath and disappointment were
depicted on the faces of these enterpris
ing persons when they saw they had been
foiled.
The remains of Brooks will be shipped
East on Monday, and with their departure
will close an incident in which ghoulish
rapacity was the chief feature.

H. M. WILLSON'S SAD DEATH
THE SUICIDE EIGHTY-FOTJ3
YEARS OF AGE.
Ties a Heavy Weight Around His
Neck and Calmly Lies Down in
a Receptacle Filled With
Water.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SANTA ROSA, April 21.â H. M. Will
son of Healdsburg, one of the county's
oldest citizens, committed suicide at
his home near that city this afternoon.
For some time Mr. Willson had been in
a precarious state of health. Several
years ago a cancer made its appearance
upon his face, and this, together with
his advanced age, is supposed to have
brought on the despondency which
caused him to take his life.
The method chosen was unusual in
the extreme. Shortly after having fin
ished his luncheon Mr. Willson repaired
to the barn yard in the rear of his resi
dence, removed the handle from a
heavy iron sledge hammer, tied the
huge piece of iron around his neck with
a piece of bale rope and calmly lay
down in a large horse trough filled with
water. When found an hour or so later
life was extinct.
H. M. Willson was well known to al
most every resident of Healdsburg, and
had in addition a laiÂ»ge circle of ac
quaintances throughout the county.
For many years he was a director of
the bank of Healdsburg and he had
long been prominent in business and
financial circles. Of late years he had
paid comparatively little attention to
business, his eighty-four years weigh
ing too heavily upon him. He was well
supplied with this world's goods and
leaves considerable valuable property.
Two grandchildren are left to mourn
his death.

provide for the men stricken down while
in the performance of duty. The work
was carried cut on road, humanitarian
lines as the society dispenses all its chari
ties; without a thought as to the creed or
the nationality of persons- receiving its
bounty. The departure of the soldiers did
not complete the work on their behalf.
Many of the men left families unprovided
for and the society undertook to care for
them. This burden, added to the others,
rapidly dtpleted the funds of the society,
Hence" the bazaar to replenish them.

A SEWER SYSTEM
IS NOW ASSURED
THE PRELIMINARY WORK PRO-
VIDED FOR.
Conference Between the Mayor, Sup
ervisors Aigeltinger and Holland
and Messrs. Marsden Manson
and C. E. Grunsky.
A conference was held in Mayor Phe- I
late y sterday afternoon be- :
tween the !4ayor, Supervisors Ai^vlting'er
and Hollan neers Marsden Man- ,
son and C. K. Grunsky for the purpose of
g ways and means for making a I
quate sewer system
in the proposed call for a bond election.
The first and greatest difficulty encoun
was that of getting the money I
: ;.' make the preliminary surveys
. lans that are necessary to be made
under the law before the item of sewers
can he included in the call for an election.
it is estimated that at least JIH.OOO will be
arj to make the accomplishment of
this work )>"ssible. This amount .>f money
now available and will not he until j
eginning of the next fiscal year. It
ed thai resolution be framed
- forth the, intention of the Board
to Institute the building â 
wi r system as well as the appoint
vll i nglneers to map
out the work. T to this plan
was that it would not meet the requlre
he law regulating the cÃllir^ of
a bond election.
After much discussion it was finally de
cided to frame a resolution appropriating
ii"v from the street Improvement fund
the beginning of the necessary work
of preparing plans and specifi*
the new sewer Bystem. The resolution
will also j.roviilo for the appointment of
: Marsden Hanson, Â» - . K. Qrunsky and City
and County Surveyor Tiltoii as a board
gineers to perform this work. This
itlon will be presented to the I
pi rrta ra i n Monday after flra
ibmltted to the City and County At
torney for his approval.
It Is estimated that this Bum of wwo w ju
ry cost
of the work until July 1, aftt-r which time
the funds for the m-xt fiscal y\ .*r will he
available and can be drawn upon for th<>
! balance of the cost. It is under
that Messrs. M i Grunsky will
receive the sum of $4i\X) each for their
services.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, APRIL 22, 1899.
PAINT AND POWDER OR
NATURE'S HANDIWORK?
JUDGE GRAHAM certainly missed one of the opportunities of his life yes- "I"
terday morning. Mrs. Laura Travers, on trial for battery for having, it Is V
claimed, swatted the cheek of Attorney Plstolesi, took the stand, raised $
the brown mesh that half concealed her rosy cheeks and turning to his Honor*'
said: â¢Â«
"He referred to me as a painted woman. My color is natural. Here, take %
my handkerchief, Judge, and convince yourself. See if you can rub the bloom
off my face." . . $
His Honor declined, but drew his chair nearer to the witness and listened <h
with marked attention to the balance of her testimony. 9
On the 14th hist, in Judge Dunne's court Mrs. Travers was a witness In a
pult brought by one George W. Fletcher against her husband. When Fletcher â
was called to offer testimony in rebuttal be referred to Mrs. Travers as "a vi
painted lady." Later when Mrs. Travers met Fletcher in the corridor of the %
City Hall she led off with her right hand and struck Fletcher upon the cheek, <!
and finished off the. contest by smashing Pistolesi in the nearest corner of his &
face. Pistoles! had Mrs. Travers arrested and charged with battery, and the Â£
case was on trial In Department 3 of the Police Court yesterday morning. 3*
Several witnesses were called both for the defense and the prosecution, Â£
and they helped complicate matters by variously demonstrating the famous <Â§,
blow. 'â , ;â¢'-â¢ -.'>;-.â  Â£$
Pistolesi swore that Mrs. Travers "struck at him." W. P. Reed declared '<;.
under oath that "Mrs. Travers hauled off at Pistolesi," and when the Judge <$
asked "What kind of a blow?" he scientifically explained that "it was a right 5
â¢hand, good swing," and though Pistolesi "stopped it he came up smiling." â 9.
Travers said his. wife "made a pass at Pistolesi"; Mr. Murphy's version $
was that Mrs. Travers "attempted to strike," and George \V. Fletcher af- <*Â£
firmed "she hit Pistolesi and struck at me; but I did not mind, and consid- v
ered it an honor to be licked by a lady." X
Mrs. Travers, who is perhaps the best qualified to judge just what sort of %
a blow It was, referred to it as an "an upper cut," and In deference to the Â£
superior judgment of the lady It should bo recorded in the archives of state *j>
In that ringside fashion. ;'-.'; *Â£
W. P. Reed and George W. Fletcher, witnesses for Pistolesi, swore that X
without provocation Mrs. Travers struck at the attorney. Attorney Barry, 'Â«>
John Murphy and Mr. Travels, witnesses for the defense, declared that Mrs. $
Travers struck at Fletcher; that Plstolesi caught her by the wrist and in re- &
turn received the "upper cut" that is causing all the trouble. 2;
Mrs. Travers took the stand in her own defense, and after offering her #
cheek- to judicial test she rolled up her sleeves and showed the court a discol- <Â£
oreo* arm, which, she claims,' is the work of the attorney. &
There is still one witness to be examined by Judge Dunne before the Â£.
case can be decided. Pistolesi has said he is willing to submit the case and *?
abide by the decision of Judge Dunne. 2
On the stand Barry swore that Pistolesi, as well as Fletcher, had referred .'â 
in court to Mrs. Travers as the "painted woman." Pistolesi emphatically de- Q
clares that he did not, and so to-day Judge Graham will confer with Judge <Â£
Dunne, and if Dunne says he did, Pistoiesi loses the case; if Dunne says he V
did not, Judge Graham will render his decision to-day. -' x â ' X;
CAPT. DILLON
PAID A FINE
FOR BRUTALITY
Master of the Morgan
City Mulcted.
BEAT A MAN WITH A MAUSER
THREE HUNDRED AND FITTY
DOLLARS PENALTY.
The Gallant Captain Went to the
Transport Hotly Enraged and
Discharged the Chief
Witness.
Captain John G. Dillon, master of the
Government transport Morgan City, ap
peared before United States District
Judge de. Haven yesterday morning
nee, having been convicted on the
previous day of brutally beating a ma
rine fireman on board the transport while
tiarbor Of Nagasaki.
Judge de Haven Imposed a fine of $350
upon the gallant captain, and the captain
without any delay deposited seventeen
twenty-dollar pieces and a ten-dollar
coin on the clerk's desk and was dis
charged.
There was a hot time on the transport
â¢when the captain returned to the Mor
gan City. Quartermaster Redlngton was
summarily discharge-d and another mem,
ber of the crew fled from the captains
wrath and sought a job elsewhere.
The captain's story of the, beating dif
fered materially from that of his offl
cers and subordinates. His statement
was that Gus Mohr, a fireman, came into
his cabin under the Influence .if liquor
and in "a rude, boisterous and aggres
sive manner" demanded money. Upon
the captain refusing to dole out to him
any of the "root of all evil," Mohr called
him an Insulting name and struck him
with his fist on the sou'west by W< it
quarter of the jaw.
This was too much for th<' patience of
Captain Dillon and he seized a relic of
the Spanish-American warÂ« a Ms
rifle, and with well directed nim dropped
one end of it on the nor' nor'easi quarter
- :' Mohr'B skull and floored him. knocking
him out and into a dreamless sle< .
about twenty minutes' duration.
The captain sent at once for a surgeon,
who dressed the wounds of the drunken
tin man, who was Quite sober wht-n he
hove to.
The story told by Quartermaster Red
ington and the chief engineer is some
what different. They Bwore that when
Mohr asked the captain for money the
captain knocked him. down, and while
Mohr was prone on the deck the captain
beat him on the back with the barrel of
the rifle, the butt having been broken by
the force of the first blow.
While Captain Dillon was inspiring a
wholesome terror by his presence on the
transport, Mohr was closeted with his
lawyer, the latter being engaged in draw
ing up the papers in a libel against the
owners of the Morgan City. The libel
was filed shortly before 4 o'clock in the
clerk's office of the United States Dis
trict Court.
The suit names as defendant John J.
Dillon (by whom is meant John ft. Dillon,
the captain i, and the owners, the Joseph
Laduc Mining and Development Company
ol Yukon, the same being a New Jersey
corporation, and John Harm-son. Mohr
asks for $5000 damages, alleging at the
same time that he has suffered perma
nent injury to his health and his sight
by reason of the beating he received with
the rifle.
It was reported around the water front
yesterday afternoon that Captain Dillon
will not go to Manila on the Morgan City,
and that Ills connection with that vessel
has been severed.
PRECITA VALLEY CLUB.
Extension of Electric Poles Indorsed
by the Organization.
A large and influential meeting of resi
dents and members of the Precita Valley
Improvement Club were present at the
meeting last night at Graham's Hall on
Alabama street. The club, on motion of
John T. Graham, unanimously adopted
the following; resolution:
Resolved, By the Precita Valley Improve

A petition was> offered signed by over
fifty resident property-owners requesting
the Supervisors to take action on the fill-
Ing In of the swamps lying inside of
Twenty-fifth. Army, I'tah and Columbia
Btreeta, as toe same are injurious to th>'
health of the people who have pure!;.).- .1
rty and built homes for themselves
and their families. The deplorable condi
tion of the Bryant-street sewer was once
more brought to the attention of the city
authorities, and at the request oÂ£ Fresi
den J. B. Vazzard a committee was ap
pointed to wait ":i the Supervisors and
urge the construction of the Bryant-strei t
sewer from Twenty-sixth to Army street.
The same committee was authorized to
request the Supervisors to rede< m their
promise In having Bernal Park filled in
and placed in condition as a recreation
gTOunda for the benefit of the people of
that section.

SUSPECTED PRESIDIO RIOTERS

Light Charges for Serious
Offenses.
The four men identified by Rehfeld. the
Presidio saloon-keeper, as the ones who
raided his place Sunday night were turned
over to the police authorities yesterday on
warrants sworn to by Rehfeld.
The Identification of the men Is not at â¢
all satisfactory, as there is no one who ,
will say positively that they were in any I
way connected with the riot. Rehfeld
Bays be saw them there and that Is all,
and from the charges in the warrants,
malicious mischief and disturbing the |
peace, when arson and threats to kill i
rnipht as well have been' added, it be
comes apparent that the complainant lias
as little hope of a conviction as the mili- 1
tary or civil authorities.
The four men-are Arthur Billings, F.
Simmons, C. M. Cauder and Charles
Lesley, all of the casuals of the Four
teenth Infantry. All say they were not
near the place at the time of the riot, 1
and there are Several soldiers who will :
testify to that fact. Lesley says he was
coming home from the Chutes and was j
on Central avenue when the riot took
place and he went down there because he j
saw the house on fire. Cauclcr says he 1
was on guard and was walking his post
at the time of the riot and the others say
they were anywhere but at the trouble.
The four were taken to the Central sta
tion in the patrol wagon in charge of

A Georgia clergyman. Rev. G. H. Akridge, of

Dr. Pierce, says: "We had been married six
years without offspring, when my wife com-
menced taking Dr. Pierces Favorite Prescrip-
tion. I then â wrote to you' for advice, and your
instructions were to give ' Golden Medical Dis-
covery ' alternately with the ' Favorite Prescrip,-
tion.' This we did. The result is restoration of
my wife to good health and a ten pound boy. In
honor of the world-famed Dr. Pierce, I have
named him Pierce. ' Favorite Prescription ' is
certainly the medicine for invalid women."
The vast experience and skill which Dr.
Pierce has acquired during his thirty years'
practice as chief consulting physician to
the Invalids' Hotel and Surgical Institute,

evening. Lydla D. Jacob, the elocution
ist, charmed a large and appreciative au
dience, each member of which was cer
tain that the lady's "last" number was
"the b<
Miss Jacob first gave "The "Widow Bel
lamy's Kxperience in a New York Ho
tel" in such a naive and graceful man
ner as to win an enthusiastic recall and
a number of floral tributes. She fol
lowed this with a reading, "To the Mem
ory of Patrick Connor." This number
Bhowed.the lady In a new light, and the
ia of the story brought tears to the
eyes of nearly every woman in the au
dience. "The Humors of Elocution"
showed the elocutionist's skill in dialect,
but with "Ben Hur's Chariot Race" she
electrified the audience. They followed
the contest with breathless attention,
and when Hen Hur won they rejoiced
with him and encored Miss Jacob.
"Aunt Stutslnalser's Philosophy" gave
Professor Cyrus Brownlee , Newton a
chance to show his ability as an inper-
Bonator, and in a sketch called "The Si
' lent System" he deepened the good im
presjsion he had made. Tn the latter
I number he was assisted by Miss Noble.
The other numbers on list- programme
! were two barytone solos by Airt La Faille,
two soprano solos by Alice M. Armstrong
, and a violin solo by Miss May E.
Walker.
WITTMAN AGAIN TESTIFIES
More Facts Brought to Light in the
Jockey Club Case.
All day yesterday officers who assisted
Chief l^ees In putting a quietus on gam
bling at [ngleside testified in the Pacific
Coast Jockey Club case. Captain "Wttt
man occupied the stand most of the day,
his testimony being in the same line as
that of the day before, when he told how
In obedience to orders issued by Chief
Lees the police entered the track and ar
. those who attempted to violate the
gambling ordinance.
Attorney Ach puts much stress on the
acts of the police in breaking up gather
of track patrons around the pool' 1
boxes when the people In such gatherings
were doing nothing but hunt the police
and devising ways and means by which
they could wager on the races and es
cape arrest. Mr. Ach contends that such
acts on the part of thr police were "the
personification of nerve and without war
rant," but the testimony shows that such
gatherings were broken up to prevent
hand-booking. When Wittman left the
stand Sergeant Helms was called to tes
tify as To various incidents of the days
of the raids, tie had not finished his tes
timony when the case went over.
THE POOLSELLING CASES.
All Those on Judge Mogan's Calendar
Continued Till Wednesday
to Be Set.
When the case of IT. L. Jones, bookmak
er, arrested at the Ingrles track
under the recent ordinance against pool
selling, was called in Judge Mogan's
court yesterday Attorney Ach for i ;
fendant moved for a dismissal of the
'â  on the ground that on the trial a -week
. ago the jury stood ten for acquittal. The
Judge promptly denied the motion and
continued the case and the other cas
, his calendar till Wednesday to be se"t for
â  trial.
Judge suggested to Ach that Judge
m should i"- called upon to try one
df the cases In his court ana, as they were
to come up Monday to lÂ»- act, the oppor
tunity should In- t;ik'-n till â  t one
of the casi b. Ach promisi d to do so.

GREAT MODERN REMEDY!
Paine's Celery Compound Has Driven Out the
Old-Fashioned Cure-Ails.
The old-timo tonics, sarsaparillas. ner-
vints and haphazard remedies of our
forefathers won't do in the spring of
Your great grandmother didn't take
Paine's celery compound any more than,
she used the electric light or the tele-
graph.
But her children and grandchildren, the.
grown-up men and women of to-day, are
taking this great modern spring remedy
and getting rid â â â¢'. diseases that the old,
unscientific preparations made no impres-
sion onâ and are making no impression on.
to-day.
Paine's celery compound has as little in
common with any of these obsolete reme-
dies as modern, life-saving antiseptic sur-
gery has with the practice of a few years
ago, which was attended with so f.-arful
â¢h rate. The half a century that has
elapsed since these old-fashioned i
dies were formulated has been the most
fruitful years in medical discovery. It
has witnessed the discovery of the most
effective medicine the world has ever
known. As a remedy for blood and nerves
Paine's celery compound has been wel-
comed by physicians, prescribed and pub-
licly recommended. No remedy has ever
approached Palne's celery compound in
its wonderful succpss with diseases and
ailments due to nervous debility and im-
pure blood.
Paine's celery rompntind is as unlike any
remedy that had gone before it. and as
superior to Its nearest rival, as the gTeat
blight is to the tallow dip. It is not
a mere improvement nor a development of

a totally new departure in the cure of
blood and nerve diseases, and cures where
remedies fail. I I embodies
the newest investigations into the source
of these diseases.
And that is the reason why Paine's cel-
ery compound is the most successful rem-
edy in the world.
The following letter from Miss Louise
Wolcott, one of the officials of the Daugh-
ters of the American Revolution, shows
the estimation in which Paine's celery
compound is held by persons who have
. it:
NEW YORK, Fob. 21, 1599.
Messrs. "Wells, Richardson & Co.,
Gentlemen â Having for BeveraJ years
been subjected to heavy strain on my ner-
vous system and feeling utterly worn out
and discouraged, after consultation with
my physician, I began tiding Paine's cel-
ery compound, and am only too glad to
add my testimony to the many thousands
you already have of Its efficacy in rebuild-
ing the nervous system. I now feel like
eh entirely different person.
Â¥cry truly yours,
LOUISE WOLCOTT.
"Were it possible to keep the nerves al-
ways strong and in cairn working order,
j few parsons would know what it is t.' be

and worry and the ".-hut-in" life all win-
ter, nerveo re, more or less seri-

FASTER THAN HARES.
Dops That Will Show at the Union
Park Meeting To-Day and
To-Morrow.
All coursing records again went glim
mering this week. A total of 120 dogs
will course at â ion Park to-day and to- I
morrow; and this number of nominations '
for two days' coursing exceeds all pre- '
vious records. Twenty-four fashionably :
bred youngsters were entered In the sap
ling stake- and the first pair will go to
the slips to-day promptly at 11 o'clock
and the stake will be run down twice be
fore iece=s. On the arrival of the 12:55 j
train from the city the open stake will be j
run down once.
The open stake has twenty-six nomlna- !
tions and all of the very best cracks in !
the State are in the running. Connemara j
and Prince Hal are expected by the "wise j
ones" to right it out in the final, but as ;
more than fifty of the dogs entered have j
at various times been stake winners. it j
looks to the average coursing man that:
the ultimate winner of the big stake is j
an open question.
The Union Park management propose !
npxt week to have three great days' sport, j
as Governor Gage has declared Monday, ;
May 1. a legal holiday. One thousand dol- j
Kirs will be added and the prizes will be j
exceedingly liberal. Two stakes will be j
run â a non-winners' and a class s,take, |
with an entrance fee of 12 SO in the former i
and $5 in the latter. Dogs winning one
cduree In the reserve stake will receive :
$7 50. the second Jl2 50 and other prizes in |
proportion. First prize HOO, second JBO. J
The class stake will be worth winningâ i
first prize 5125. second $\M. third $ia and !
the winner of one course $10. These prizes |
will be offered on a basis of ninety-six j
does in the reserve !tak< and forty or
forty-eight in the open stake.

KNOCKED OUT
BY HIS WIFE
Philip Bauer Sustains a Fractured
Skull and .Mrs. Bauer Is
Locked Dp.
THKRE was a Berioua misunderstanding In the home of Philip Bauer, SI
Clara street, late Thursday night, and it ended in Bauer being treated at
the Receiving Hospital for a compound fracture of the skull caused by a
blow from a pftcher wielded by Mrs. Bauer. Bauer drove to the hospltaJ in
a hack about 1 o'clock yesterday morning and was treated for a fractured skull
I y Dr. Thompson. The fracture was not serious and fatal results are not antici
pnted. When asked how he met with the accident, he said he was on his way
home and was attacked by robbers who knocked him senseless by a blow on
the head with some instrument and then robbed him.
Captain Spillane was notified of the alleged robbery, and he went to the
hospital and questioned Bauer, who admitted that he was romancing, and that
his wife had dealt htm the blow that caused the fracture. The captain detailed
Policemen Callahan and Chase to arrest Mrs. Bauer, but meantime Policemen
Tuite and Regan had heard of the affray and arrested Mrs. Bauer about 4
k yesterday morning. She was taken to the City Prison and booked on a
charge of assault with a deadly weapon. When Bauer heard of her arrest he
told Captain Spillane that if he should die he wanted his wife exonerated from
all blame.
Mrs. Bauer, whn Is a handsome and powerfully built woman, said later that
her husband came hnm? drunk shortly before midnight, and as usual was in
an ugly mood. He had a hahit of twisting her arm whÂ»n he was 'â¢full" and
seized her by the right arm and gave it a rapid twist that made her stream with
pain. Then he struck her, knocking her down, and while on the floor he kicked
her on the face, blackening her eye. She struggled to her feet and seizing- a
pitcher that contained eider she brought it down on his head, smashing the pit
cher into fragments. Bauer left the house and two or three hours later she was
arrested. She declared he was in the habit of beating her when he was drunk,
which was very often, and she had him arrested more than once for battery.
yesterday afternoon she was released on J2Â»V> bonds accepted by Judge Mogan.
Fhe had previously appeared in Judge Graham's court, and the case was con
tinued until Monday.
Bauer is a salesman in the wholesale store of Greenebaum, Weil and Michels,
Sansome street, and weights about half as much as his wife. He claims that
his wife In their quarrels was always the aggressor and more than fifty times
had she cut him in her angry moods. For the sake of their little girl he had
borne with her, but the end had come. He would not prosecute her and would
not testify a-galnst her. He denied being drunk Thursday night and put the
blame of the trouble upon his wife. He was taken from the hospital yesterday
afternoon by his sister.
Bauer was a member of the National Guard during the big railroad strike
about five year? ago. and while on duty in Sacramento was shot in the foot.
Ho was crippled for a long time in consequence and brought suit against the
railroad company for damages.

Chick Finnerty and Jack Kinnane, a sail
or of the battleship lowa, who was tat
tooed with the American colors on body
and back, taking on the appearance of a
museum fr<=>ak. Several men-of-warsmen
were present to see their comrade per
form.
In the first round Kinnane got a right
hander on the jaw which sent him to the
boards, but he was up In a jiffy and
fought back with vim. driving two hard
straight handers on Finnerty's neck. In
the second round Kinnane battered his
opponent all around the ring with right
hand upper cuts. The third was evenly
contested. In the fourth Kinnane had
much the better of the game. In the fifth
round Finnerty opened up a few links
and pome hot fighting resulted, the sailor
showing strong signs of groggiiur.-s.
From this time on to the tenth round the
sailor had all the bf-st of the contest, hut
the "Iceman," who was a friend of Fin
nerty, gave the local pugilist the decis
ion, much to the disgust of the specta
tors.
The second contest was to have been a
ten-round bout between Jack Kane and
Charles Goepel. Kane stopped Goepel in
the first round and was awarded the de
dslon.
"Doc" Flynn of the South End Rowing |
Club was selected to referee the event of i
the evening, which wa.s a twenty-round j
contest between Jimmy Anthony and Wil
liam Cole. Anthony was a favorite in the
betting at 10 to 7. his friends thinking he
had a cinch in whipping Cole.
Cole was very nervous In the first round
and Anthony won a decided lead, landing 'â 
several times on his young opponent. In â 
the second round Cole caught Anthony
on the jaw with a left swing and sent
him to the carpet, where Anthony re
mained for nine seconds. This was Cole's
round. In the next round Cole plucked
up courage and fought Anthony to the i
ropes, scoring several times. The fourth
ended in favor of Anthony, who landed j
two heavy hard lefts on Cole"s nose,
drawing blood.
The fifth was even: the sixth, seventh,
eighth and ninth terminated in favor of j
Anthony. Hard fighting was seen in the i
tenth round. Cole rushed Ms opponent i
and landed two hard rights on Anthony's |
jaw. the round ending in favor of Cole, i
After this Anthony seemed to have lost j
his steam and Cole took a lead in points
in the eleventh, twelfth, thirteenth and
fourteenth rounds. The fifteenth was
even. The sixteenth ended in Anthony's
fa% - or. In the seventeenth Cole won a
short lead on points, but in the eight
eenth, nineteenth and twentieth Anthony
certainly had all the hest of the contest.
In the last round Cole resorted to very
cowardly tactics, running away from his
man and clinching and throwing his arms
around Anthony's legs to avoid punish
ment. The spectators were surprised
when the referee gave a decision in favor
of Cole. Anticipating trouble, the police
escorted the referee out of the building.
Diet and Sleep.
Diet and sleep were subjects discussed
by the San Francisco Child Study
Club yesterday afternoon at the Occi
dental. Mrs. H. O. Bridge read an ad- ,
dres3 on "Dietetics," which was deliv- 1
rrp<l before the National Mothers' Con
gress by Mrs. Louise H^gan. Mrs. George
Waif presented the subject of "Lunches
for School Children" and "The Habit of
Sleep." An informal discussion followed
in which a number of ladies present took
part.
Next Friday afternoon Professor Jaffa
will continue the subject of food, and all
Interested are cordially Invited.

A REMARKABLE INVENTION
BY AN OHIOAN.
A genius of Cincinnati has patented and
placed on the market a remarkable Bath
Cabinet, whereby any one resting on a
chair within enjoys the famous Turkish,
hot vapor or medicated baths at home
for 3 cents each, heretofore enjoyed only
by the rich at public bathrooms, health
resorts, hot springs and sanitariums.
] These baths are celebrated for their mar-
i velous cleansing, purifying and invigorat-
ing effects upon the human system, and
this Invention brings them within the
! reach of the poorest person in the coun-
try.

Astonishing is the Improvement in
j health, feelings and complexion by the
j use of this Cabinet, and it seems to us
that the long sought for natural method
of curing and preventing disease without
medicine has certainly been found.
The makers inform the writer that 88,-
-j 356 of these Quaker folding thermal Cabi-
' nets have been sold since January 1. and
showed letters from thousands of users
who speak of this Cabinet as giving en-
tire satisfaction.
Since this invention bathtubs have been
discarded, for it gives a better bath for
all cleansing purposes than soap and wa-
! ter, and, as there are millions of homes
I without bathing facilities, it seems this
! would be a good article for our readers
to take the agency for.
Thousands of remarkable letters have
been written the inventors, and to our
knowledge persons who were full of
drugs and nostrums, and have been given
up to die, have been restored to perfect.

THE MORALS OF THE CITY.
THE CALL has reason to feel no little gratifica
tion over the results of the efforts it has re
cently n-.adc to purify the city of some of its
more corrupt and corrupting elements. Pool
selling a the racetrack has been suppressed, and the
gamblers have been forced to ply a nefarious trade
of bookmaking about the streets and saloons. That
practice, moreover, was exposed in The Call yester
day, and there can be little doubt the exposure will
lead to its suppress.
Hardly less notable has been the victory gained by
.king up the vicious "phonograph
end kinetoscope parlors" which have so long been an
enticement not only to depraved men but even to
school-children. As was pointed out by The Call at
the time the exposure was made, no new law or or
e was required to punish such offenders. The
proprietors of three of the so-called "parlors" have
been arrested, convicted and nned, and, furthermore,
they have been warned by the courts that if they are
found guilty of continuing the offense they will on the
next conviction have to suffer the extreme penalty of
the iaw.
The offenses of racetrack gambling, pool-selling
and the display of indecent pictures in places acces
sible to school-children were much more pernicious
in theii than any conceivable amount of gam
pium-smoking in Chinatown. None was
a victim of the Chinese depravities
lar gone in the downward path
â¢rack and the vile pictures,
however, were temptations which reached almost
everywhere. Hardly a home was sale from their in
fluences. The trail of the racetrack evil has been
marked with embezzlements, defalcations and suicides
in almost every grade of society, and, while that of the
foul parlors has been too secret to be traced, it is
certain its effects have been widely corrupting.
Fortunate tl evils have been checked at least
temporarily. (. >f course as soon as the police cease
watchful they will be revived in one form or
another. The cunning of the gamblers in arranging
Is by "handbooks" shows how crafty and
how persistent are the violators of the law. Eternal
vigilance is clearly the price of morality, as well as
: liberty. What has been achieved, however, is
a proof that morality can be upheld and law enforced
in San Francisco whenever the police are active and
Judges resolute in the performance of their duty, and
that in itself is encouraging to all good citizens.
SALINAS AND THE NATIVES.
rOR the time being Salinas is the capital city of
the State, the metropolis of its hospitable ac
tivities and the Mecca of its natives. As was
once said of Jay Gould, it "is little but large." The
large enterprise of Salinas, however, is not to be the
making of a corner to cinch lambs, but that of throw
ing wide all the doors of her hospitable homes and
giving welcome to the Native Sons.
One of the happiest customs adopted by the Na
tive Sons and Native Daughters is that of holding
their annual gatherings at the different cities of the
State by turns, showing no partiality for the large
cities over the smaller towns. By reason of that cus
tom the young men and young women of California
are brought into contact with the people of every
section, and their local prepossessions are subordi
nated to genuine State patriotism.
The benefits derived by the members of the two
associations from the custom are not greater, how
ever, than those they confer on many of the commu
nities at which they assemble. Towns which are not
notable as commercial centers nor as tourist resorts
are by these meetings given a temporary prominence
which awakens public interest in their attractions,
their industries and the value of the resources around
them. In that way the advantages they offer for
home-seekers or lor investors of capital receive a
liberal advertising and the progress of the community
is thus materially promoted.
Salinas will be able to show to her visitors much
that will surprise many of them. It is the center of a
rich industrial section, and the beet sugar industry
has there reached proportions that justify a feeling
of pride on the part of every Californian. The Na
tive Sons will see in what has been accomplished
abundant promise of the coming of a time when
California, if the enterprise of her people be not
crushed by the competition of the cheap labor of the
tropics, will be able to supply sugar enough to meet
the whole demand of the United States.
The industrial features of the city and its surround
ing country, we may be sure, will not be overlooked
by the Native Sons, notwithstanding the strong at
traction of the various entertainments which the hos
pitality of Salinas has arranged for their pleasure. It
is safe to say the meeting of the Grand Parlor will be
an instructive as well as a pleasant one, and both
Salinas and her guests may be congratulated on the
01 tasion.
A headline in the morning papers is to the effect
that Miss Jane Hodge of Oakland has sued John
Nicholl for fifty thousand dollars for "burning
kisses." The mystery still remains how did John
manage to get combustion on such an ephemeral
thing a 6 a kiss.
ANOTHER REPUBLICAN TRIUMPH-
THERE have been five Senatorial deadlocks in
the Tinted States this year, two of them in Cali
fornia and Pennsylvania, in each of which the
deliberate attempt was made and inexorably pressed
to substitute the will of corporations for the will of
the people, but in each of which, also in the face of
such concentrated influence as has never been pre
viously equaled, the integrity of the Republican party
has been vindicated.
The analogy between the protracted contests in
Pennsylvania and in this State is incomplete in two
particulars, one of them discreditable to each com
monwealth. In personal qualifications for the Fed
eral Senate, omitting the moral element, Matthew
Stanley Quay is immeasurably superior to Daniel M.
Burns. Mr. Quay has served in the Senate of the
United States and he is a man of strong intellect, of
fair education and of diversified experience in heavy
business, which brought him into contact with able
and strong men. In all other respects than integrity,
though far from great, he is qualified to hold his
own in the discussion and solution of national ques
tions. On the other hand, Dan Burns possesses very
moderate intelligence, and during his whole life, so
far as known to the public, has manifested no ca 1
parity that would raise him above the level of an or
dinary Supervisor. His range, even in boss training,
has been narrow and mainly confined to municipal
politics, and in other respects he has been identified
not with large rings or heavy operations but with the
demoralized racetrack and with other kindred degra
dations.
As between these two favorites of monopoly and
corruption, therefore, Pennsylvania had the advantage
of California. In one other particular they were sub
stantially alrke. Dan Burns had been tried for mal
versation in office and acquitted by throwing the
blame on his deputy, who in his turn secured his own
freedom by making his principal responsible. Matt
Quay was actually on trial for the fraudulent use o>
State funds deposited in a bank while his partisans,
the representatives of every element that insulted and
derided the people, were steadily voting for him. His
acquittal by a jury, though a technical exoneration,
will not remove the unfavorable impression from the
people.
Throughout the entire struggle, however, the Re
publicans 'if this State stood higher than the Repub
licans of* Pennsylvania. .Matt Quay started with 113
votes and ended with 0.5, either number constituting
a majority of the representative? of the party in the
joint convention. Here Dan Burns began and closed
with a minority, and at no time had more than half
enough votes to elect or more than one-third
or thereabouts of the Republican legislators.
If there could be degrees, therefore, in party honor
California holds the post of vantage, from which it
is unlikely that she could be dislodged, even by an
extra session, if the fatuous subserviency to the rail
road of Governor Gage should lend him to that sui
cidal extremity or though he should imitate the
example of the Governor of Pennsylvania by assum
ing the right to appoint when the Legislature lias
failed to elect. But the central and dominating fact,
which deprives the Bryan Democracy of their chief
slogan, is that in both States the corporations and the
other corrupt political manipulators were beaten by
the voice of the people, expressed by incorruptible
Republicans. The result has proved that, though
sometimes deceived, the Republican party as a body
can be trusted, and that on all public matters it re
fuses to submit to corporate dictation.
This outcome of the Senatorial deadlocks is recog
nized not only in the United States but in Europe,
where, for example, referring to those Stat.
eluding California, which, through party honesty and
firmness, have been temporarily deprived of half their
representation in the Federal Senate, so influential
and well-informed a newspaper as the London Daily
Chronicle says: "They are probably better without
Senators than with men of the class who try to bribe
themselves into office." This passage was written be
fore the legislative defeat or the gubernatorial success
of Matt Quay, and the same paper, not anticipating
the possibility of the combination in his favor being
beaten, added: "In other States â notably in Penn
sylvania, still under the sway of Boss Quay â Sena
torial elections have of late been a disgrace."
The successful disregard of public opinion by Big
Boss Quay and by Little Boss Burns is over, and the
outlook for 1900 against the rag-tag and bobtail
Democracy, representing every un-American element
in the country and led by William J. Bryan, is pro
pitious for the Republican party.
FLAX GRfIIN BOGS.
IN the rural notes published in this paper we re
cently commented on the report of a Belgian ex
pert on the fine quality of flax fiber produced on
this coast. It was worked up in the great Belgian
linen factories and was found to be the best
quality, outranking any American fiber that had been
tried.
As there is much land in California that can raise
heavy crops of flax, it is of sufficient importance to be
thoroughly experimented with, even if its production
be only to add another to the many exported articles
produced on our ranches.
Since that publication was made information is at
hand making flax of more immediate importance than
before. The State of Washington has a jute plant in
its penitentiary engaged in making grain bags, fol
lowing the example of California in San Qucntin.
The jute for this purpose is imported from India.
Some plans have been laid to domesticate jute cul
ture in this country, but no progress has been made.
The growth of ramie for its fiber has also been made
the subject of experiment, but the cost of decortica
tion by ordinary process is so great that the industry
has not been found suited to our wage scale and in
dustrial conditions.
While we have been looking to these exotic fiber
plants it would seem that we have neglected to de
velop the possibilities of flax fiber, about the produc
tion of which there is no doubt, and which is easily
processed by methods that arc in line with our wage
scale and the American labor system.
In the Washington penitentiary experiments have
Veen made with flax tow, grown in Oregon and
California, as material for grain bags. The Review
of Spokane says that the test proved an unqualified
success, and that the jute machinery, with some in
expensive alterations, can be used on flax tow with
profitable results. Bags made of flax in the test
stood 30 per cent more strain than the jute bags.
Representative farmers have highly approved the
flax bags.
The farmers of California make use of the prison
jute bags, and, when the law is rightly administered,
they are saved much money in the sacking required to
carry to market their crops of grain, potatoes,
onions, carrots and beans. The State pays out much
money every year for the Indian iutc fiber used in this
manufacture. If it be a fact that flax tow can be used
instead of jute this money will be kept at home and
the rural industries of California will get a double
profit out of the busings, for they can produce the
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, APRIL 22, 1899.
raw material and have an additional crop with which
to further diversify farming.
In another view of it very important results may
follow the successful substitution of flax for jute in
sacking. The Belgian experts found our flax equal
to the celebrated Coutrai product, which is the finest
flax fabric in the world. While tow goods may be
made of rlax in almost any locality, the finer qualities
of linen require certain favorable conditions that do
not exist everywhere.
Ireland and Belgium are noted for their fine linens
because of local conditions which were discovered
empirically.
But the ancient Egyptians made very fine linen, so
fine that it was an article of luxury used in the vest
ments of the priests. The linen used as cerements for
their dead is preserved on Egyptian mummies and is
of excellent quality. Its modern imitation, called
"mummy cloth," is evidence of its high class.
Xow the climate of Egypt is not unlike that of
California, and if the ancients could, without our
modern machinery or knowledge of the chemistry of
retting the fiber, produce linen of a quality that would
find favor now, why may it not be done in California?
It is remarked that manufactures take hold here
slovviy. One reason i> that California is not a pro
ducer of iron ore, so that throughout the range of
iron and steel manufacture the material has to be im
ported; the same is true of the hardwoods used in
vehicle manufacture and cooperage. We are richer
than any other part of the world in coniferous timber,
but are deficient in hard timber. This handicaps the
vast variety of metal and wood manufactures here
and makes us in a measure dependent upon others.
The most successful manufacturing is carried on
either where the raw material is produced or where
there are exceptional physical conditions favorable to
its manufacture. Nearly all manufactures of the great
staples which are the necessaries of life had a rude
and crude form in the beginning, as the modern
Sheffield cutlery began in the rude "whittle" ad
mired by the Saxons and Angles. It is quite possible
that water may be found in California as suited to
retting flax as that of the Lys in Belgium, and that
beginning with the coarsest use of flax tow in making
grain bags we may domesticate not only the crop of
raw material but its use in the highest and finest
fabrics.
The authorities should inaugurate experiments at
the jute plant in San Quentin like those carried on at
Walla Walla, in Washington, and, if equally success
ful, a sufficient breadth of flax should be planted here
to experiment on a large scale, to secure proof that
will warrant the required amendments in the jute
machinery to adapt it to flax.
We are not informed whether flax can I>e permitted,
to ripen its seed and at the same time afford a fiber in
condition for use. If the two can go together the
crop capable of this double use would surely be safely
profitable. The farmers of the State should commu
nicate with the prison ofticers, and the agricultural
department of the State University should collect and
distribute information on the subject. As far as the
matter has proceeded we have the conclusions of the
Belgian linen manufacturers and the result of the
prison experiment in Washington. If such results
can be reached with our flax fiber abroad we may
hope to produce them at home.
The recent addition of the sugar beet to the list of
profitable farm products is held to I>e of great signi
ficance to the rural prosperity of the Slate. If it can
be promptly followed by the introduction of profit
able flax culture the addition of two new crops will
greatly add to our rural wealth.
PRIMARY ELECTION REFORM.
SENATOR STRATTOX, author of the new
primary election law, writes to The Call to say
that according to his reading the newspapers
of the State do not seem to understand the fact that
the statute would not be constitutional if it embodied
the right of challenge for party affiliation or included
a tc>t as a qualification for voting. Mr. Stratton is
probably correct in this conclusion, for the comments
which have followed the Stockton election indicate
that the people generally regard the omission of a
test as a -moils defect in the law.
The Call, however, is not included among those
who do not understand the difficulties with which
Senator Stratton contended when he drew this
statute. When the bill was brought before the Legis
lature we called attention to the decision of the Su
preme Court in the case of Spier vs. Baker and
mildly counseled an abandonment of any attempt to
legislate upon the subject. We did not then sec how
Senator Stratton would be able to frame a practical
primary law without including a test, which the Su
preme Court had decided to be in all its phases un
constitutional. Hut the Senator did the best he
could and has produced a law which, if it is not the
success anticipated by its friends, will fail mainly be
cause the Supreme Court has placed in his way an
insurmountable obstacle to a working statute.
We think the machinery of the new primary law
would work satisfactorily if a test were provided. As
it is there is but one substitute to the qualification,
and that will be an endeavor on the part of the peo
ple to keep track of the politics of those who vote
at primary elections and, as far as posible, separate
the Republicans from the Democrats. At Stockton
the Democrats had no contest, and so they generally
voted with the Republican factions, thus aiding the
latter to elect a choice lot of machine delegates.
However, the absence of a test need not much
longer obstruct the work of the primary election re
formers. Senator Stratton succeeded in getting
through the Legislature a constitutional amendment
conferring the power necessary to prescribe a voting
test at such elections. This amendment will be sub
mitted to the people next year, and if the new pri
mary statute is even a qualified success it will be
easy enough to secure its ratification. Certainly the
people will be in favor of the enactment of a strin
gent primary law when they find that Senator Strat
ton's creation has embarrassed the political bosses.
That the new law is going to embarrass these bosses
is already quite apparent, for in various portions of
the city preparations are being made for the election
of independent delegates.
Governor Gage is justifying the prophecy of his
friends that he might be expected always to do the
unexpected. The Governor is becoming polite â that
is, he says so. He refused politely last night to be
interviewed. His Excellency may find it expedient
before his term expires to ask politely to be inter
viewed.
The officials of Nevada County, according to the
dispatches, have three theories as to the whereabouts
of Murderer Moore. The other is that he is still at
large.
The worst has come to the worst. Other people
have been roasted, but it remained for President
David Starr Jordan to be "Fryed." By a woman at
that.

WHY MAGUIRE WAS DEFEATED.
Organizer Norton of the Democratic Clubs
Thinks It Was Because Those Bodies
, Were Ignored.
Organizer M. G. Norton of the California Division of National Demo
cratic Clubs thinks "he knows why his party was defeated last fall. He
gives his reason for the overthrow in the following circular letter addressed
to the clubs throughout the State: ISM
As your experience in politics will enable you to appreciate the vast amount
of work which this office has been compelled to handle during the work or or
ganization, you will doubtless pardon my seeming neglect in addressing you De
fore this. When it is considered that we have sent out in the neighborhood or
25,000 pieces of mail, and conducted a correspondence involving the preparation
of hundreds of letters daily, you will hardly blame us for devoting our energies
to other localities than those in which we were represented.
As one of the gentlemen representing us on our committee, and by reason of
the fact that you have demonstrated the sincerity of your ro-operation In many
ways, I think it but right that you should be fully informed of the status of our
organization at this time and the principal obstacles which have presented tlicm
selves.
We started upon our work on the first of January. IS9S, and notwithstand
ing the destruction of the Maine and the war with Spain which ensued, both i or
which diverted public attention from all other channels, we were mucli gratltlea
with the letters of congratulation and the offers of co-operation which poured in
upon us from every part of California. Our State committee, consisting <>r
one hundred members, was fully decided upon, and the. gentlemen appointed re
ceived similar instructions to those sent you, with the request that they Imme
diately comply with the rules and regulations governing our association, among
which was the payment of an initiation fee of $10.
About this time we were advised by the secretary of the national association
at Washington that efforts to oust me from my position were being made Dy
parties in the city of San Francisco who had no desire to allow an organization
to exist whose principal object was to foster the formation of permanent Demo
cratic clubs and societies throughout the State of California, and to insure their
active co-operation In disseminating Jeffersonlan principles of government.
Th-?se people realized that such an organization would prove an obstacle to
"ring rule" and the methods of controlling conventions which have hitherto pre
vailed.
To prevent our successful organization a gentleman whose name it Is un
necessary to mention was detailed to visit the authorities of the national as
sociation at Washington. Upon his arrival there he immediately proceeded to
accomplish the purpose of his visit; but to his astonishment he was informed
that the management of the California division was lining conducted in a manner
which had received the strongest approval of the Washington office and that a
change was not only ill timed but would under no consideration be considered
for a moment.
Since that time these San Francisco people have used every opportunity to
harass and annoy us under cover. Hundreds of our correspondents were in
receipt of communications of such a character that, notwithstanding the fart
that we represented the National Association of Democratic Clubs, they became
discouraged and the feeling of enthusiasm changed to that of indifference.
Less than one dozen of the members of our State committee sent in their In
itiation fee, upon which we had entirely depended for our running expenses. The
undersigned has, therefore, been compelled to bear practically 90 per cent of
the expanses incurred up to this time.
Notwithstanding this condition of affairs we still looked forward to the re
cent gubernatorial campaign with the hope that the same would be mutually
beneficial. We expected that thousands of correspondents and large Quantities
of literature which we could have furnished would prove of incalculable value
to the Democratic ticket; and on the other hand we hoped that our participa
tion in the campaign would tend to perfect our organization.
To our astonishment our candidate for Governor, Mr. Muguire, and the. vari
ous committees laboring in his behalf totally ignored us, notwithstanding our
repeated offers to assist in every way. Probably a dozen letters in all from
this office directed to Judge Maguire remained unanswered, and nothing was left
for us to do >>ut remain spectators while a contest in which we should have
been an important factor proceeded.
Is it any wund. r that Judge Maguire was so overwhelmingly defeated? Take
for instance Ixis Angeles County. The same combination existed in IH% and 18!I8.
The Republican party confronted the combined Democratic, Silver Republican
ami Populists, all under the same management throughout both campaigns. Yet
in 1VÂ«; with the assistance of the combined Democratic clubs of this county Mr.
Bryan was defeated by a majority of barely SUO votes; while In IS9S without us
and against a weaker candidate than President McKinley Judge Maguire was
u\( rwhi lined by a Republican majority of 4000.
This result, you are aware, obtained in nearly every county in the State. We
have communicated these matters to thenational officers at Washington, and have
informed them that until such a time as we are furnished with funds to properly
pn secute our work we shall be compelled to rest on our oars. Further aid could
hardly be expected From those who have so magnanimously contributed to our
finances, and I have reached the limit so far as I am personally concerned.
Mr. 10. N. Rector of Merced has been appointed our secretary, and Mr. D. H.
Arnold of Colusa has been appointed our treasurer. No further work, however,
will be undertaken until we can secure the necessary funds to completely perfect
the State organisation.
Trusting tv hear your views upon this (subject, and with kind regards, I am,
wry truly, MOVE G. NORTON, Official State Organizer,
California Division National Association of Democratic Clubs.
THE BEE'S DEFI,
Pacramento Bpp. April 20.
Yesterday the Bee furnished an
j ss Âr. to its readers which was in
tended ns an object lesson of the
absolute idiocy, aslninity ami in
famy cf the Morehouse sigrnaturo
law, Introduced by Senator Hotspur
Valiant Morehouse, the Senator
from Santa Clara County with the
unceasing jaw. To-day tho Bee
appears with no article signed, but
in all iis pristine vipor of thought
and outspoken expression of opin
ion.
As it stated yesterday, when it
signed its articles, it has a thor
ough ami hearty contempt for the
Morehou^e signature law. It is a
law-abiding journal, and it believes
in upholding the laws of the land.
But when bad laws, pushed to the
front by men who would trample on
the rights of the people, disgrace
net only the statute books of the
State, but as well call in question the
common sense of those who make
our codes, it is the province of wis
dom and of loyalty to good govern
ment to so act as to force the issue
into the highest court.
"Rebellion to tyrants is obedience
to God"; and to combat an unjust
and an unconstitutional law is the
highest example of good citizenship.
Therefore, to you, Henry Theophi
lus Gage, Governor of the. State of
California, morituri salutamus!
Have at thee, Hotspur Valiant
Morehouse!
Unto you, Grove Lachrymose John
son, again the renewed assurances
of our most distinguished consid
eration!

MORE EVIDENCE
THAT NEALL WAS
IN GOOD HEALTH
Testimony of the Post
Surgeon.
A DISSERTATION ON THE GRIP
IT WOULD IMPAIR A MAN'S CA
PACITY FOB. WORK.
Major Moseley Did Not Believe Neall
Was Any Worse in February
Than He Was in
December.
There was more medical testimony at
the trial of Lieutenant Neall yesterday,
but it was not of the kind that will do
the accused much good. Major Edward
B. Moseley, post surgeon of the Presidio,
was the principal witness, and his evi
dence related mostly to the condition
physical and mentalâ of Neall just before ;
he disappeared from the post.
Major Moseley was on the examining 1
board that passed upon Neall's physical j
condition at the time he was examined
for promotion. He said that at the time i
Neall was examined he was In good j
health and was physically sound. The i
witness referred to the certificate Neall
had signed and said the board did not
and does not take notice of such
certificates to any extent, for they !
do not consider an officer capable
of passing upon his own physical condi
tion, except to the extent of "calling at
tention to a blindness in one eye or the
loss of a limb."
Then followed a long dissertation on
grip and its effects, the gist of which was
that if a man was so ill he could not
properly keep books he could not prop
erly command a company, which was
precisely what the sergeant said on
Thursdayâ that Neall seemed at the in
spection to be wc-11 able to attend to his
military duties. Keeping books, the wit
ness thought, required no more exercise
of will and intelligence than to command
a company or troop at drill. Bi-yond
r^eall s statement that he had the grio
Moseley had not noticed any material
change In the appearance of the accused
from last December until he disappeared
in February. *
Regarding the dividends from the post
exchange to the post hospital. Major
Moseleysaid they should have been turned
over to him. He had not received any div
idends from the post exchange from Oc
tober last until this month, when Lieuten
ant Slavens, who succeeded Lieutenant
.Neall as post exchange officer, paid him
the dividends for the months of Novem
ber, December, January, February and
March He made no demand for these
dividends when they were not forthcom-
u &> \? mer ne had n0 knowledge of when
they had been declared, and anyway he
never had any trouble about them. When
they were due the dividends had always
been brought to him and he receipted for
them, and that ended the matter.
Mr. Thornton submitted a hypothetical
question to the witness which embraced
many of the conditions of the case, and
the answer contained the only ray of light
ror recall that appeared in the day's pro
ceedings. The many duties for which
JSeall was responsible were recited to the
witness and he was asjtod if an attack of
the grip would impair an officer's efficien
cy in all those duties. The answer was
'yes. in all his duties his efficiency would
be impaired."
Replying to further questions from the
defense Moseley said he did not consider
that Neall's health was any worse in Feb
ruary than it had been in December. The
only other witness of the day was Her
man Roth, hospital steward of the post
hospital, who came to the stand to tell of
certain prescriptions prescribed by Dr.
Edie. He was not certain there were any
for Neall, however, and he was excused
without cross-examination.
The trial is now awaiting the return
from Honolulu of Colonel Compton, conv
mander of tho Fourth Cavalry, who will
be the last witness fur the prosecution.
Captain Dan Haskell Improving.
The wife of Captain Dan Haskell reports
him as steadily improving in health. From
present indications he -will soon be attend*
ing to his duties on the bay.
TEACHERS MAY
NOW LOSE THEIR
APRIL SAURIES
Auditor Declines to
Approve Them.
MUST KEEP BOOKS STRAIGHT
NO EFFOBT MADE TO ADJUST
OLD DIFFEBENCES.
November and December Warrants
Allowed to Stand' as an Offset to
Money Illegally Paid and
Due the City.
The troublous times for the schoolteach
ers arc not yet at an end. From present
appearances their April salaries will be
withheld until such time as the differences
between the teachers and the City shall
have been finally adjusted. Auditor Asa
It. Wells, acting under the advice of his
attorney, General John 11. Dickinson, has
decided to take a stand in the matter and
have settled before it becomes too late
the accounts of the teachers.
Speaking for him yesterday General
Dickinson said: "When Mr. Wtlls audited
the January salaries of the teachers it
was with the express understanding that
they would take immediate steps to un
ravel the tangle in which their accounts
with the city were found. The court
held that they were illegally paid $100,000
last June and that they could not draw
any money from the city treasury until
that amount had been returned or offset.
Tho teachers took no steps in the matter,
and when February came around wo
stretched the law out of all recognizable
shape in. order that the teachers might
secure their pay tor which they were
clamoring.
"Within a few days it has been an
nounced that the teachers and the mer
chants have come to an agreement. Tha
merchants tako the $35,000, an unexpend
ed balance from the first half of the pres
ent fiscal year, and relinquish all claims
to share the money set aside for tho
teachers in the second half of the year.
This is all very well in its way, but there
are other parties at interest. At the end
of the fiscal year, in June, the Auditor's
books must balance and all the accounts
over which he has control must be closed.
The teachers and the merchants have paid
no heed to this. It is to force the issue
that we have taken the present stand.
"My suggestion has been that suit be
brought against Auditor Wells. It can
be taken to the Superior Court and he can
be ordered to audit the demand in ques
tion. This he will refuse to do. He can be
cited for contempt and the matter can be
taken at once to the Supreme Court on
a writ of habeas corpus. With all parties
to the suit seeking to expedite it a deci
sion should be handed down within thirty
days. The settlement of these affairs
has lagged too much. The attorneys
representing the various parties at inter
est have never met at one time and set
tled matters definitely. There has
a lack of concerted action, which would
hav.e resulted in something definite long
ago."
Persons familiar with the fight being
made by the teachers for the money due
them affirm that they do not know what
they want or what is best for them. I'hoy
have lost every suit they brought, b<
having adverse rulings handed down re
garding matters material to their cause.
The present stand taken by the Auditor
is expected to result in clearing the
ation. Both Mr. Wells and General Dick
inson have done everything in their power
to hely the cause of the teachers. In the
present instance they are providing
against possible confusion in the future.
They want to protect the bondsmen of
the Auditor from any suits that might re
sult from his failing to take due precau
tions in handling the business of his office.

DEFIES THE
SUPERVISORS
Fruitless Discussion
Over Rates.
BISHOP'S FLING AT PHELAN
:es mayors claim that
RF.CEN : ACTION HOLDS.
Bays the Idea That the
SI 10 Rate Cannot Be Rescinded
Emanates 'From a Dis-
eased Brain."
The Supervisors hÂ»ld yesterday -what
they were pleased to term an investiga
tion of the pas question. Like others
they have held recently, it was barren of
result; being a rethrashinr of old straw.
After a two hours' session the minority
members said the Inquiry was farcical
Â«md that nothing advantageous to the
city cn;;id come out of it. President
Crockett and other officers of the San
Francisco Gas and Electric Company
â were examined at considerable length,
but f"v.- additional facts were elicited.
Mr. Crockett testified that the cost of gas
delivered was $1 05 37-100.
When Mayor Phelan called the meet
ing to order there were but two mem
tt-rs of the board absentâ Messrs. Collins
and Lackman. The board at once re-
F.-'lved Itself into committee of the whole,
with! Supervisor Phelps as chairman. Su
pervisor Kalben. 'â¢â¢â â â  as head of the
street Light Committee, should have
wielded the gavel, had enough of It the
previous day and gave-way to his asso
ciate. Mayor Phelan. who acted as chief
inquisitor, opened proceedings with a
general review of-aii the board had done
to solve the gas question. He held to the
epinion. which he expressed the day be
fore, that the law permitted the fixing
of a rate to be charged for gas but once
fi year. As the board had. he claimed, by
resolution determined upon a rate of -â  10
per thousand cubic feet, it could take no
lurthvr action for another year. He be
lieved this to be a good law and that
It would stand. In the ahsenee of any
opinion from City and County Attorney
Lane, he thought it safe to presume that
to be the law.
"If the pas company believes that rate
will not compensate it on the real value
of us property," he said, "it can seek re
dress In the courts. While the matter is
pending there the householders need not
pay their bills, which would ultimately
result In groat loss to the company." He
believed its officials should meet the
board half way and agree to accept a
rate of J135, the board waiving any right
n might have to a still lower rate. He
cit^d the case of Oakland, where the rate
was fixed voluntarily by the pas com
pany at SI 50 for light arid $1 40 for heat
ing purposes. Undf.r these conditions he
thought a rate of $135 in this city would
do no violence to the interests of the San
1 rar.cisco Gas and Electric Company.
Replying to the argument of the Mayor
that the city had legal advantage over the
company.. Mr. Bishop said: "The mem
oers of this board will not sit here and i
w^ 6 need to the infamous proposition
that you have the gas company in a hole
and will force it to sacrifice its prop
â¢ I do not believe one member wants
to r.x a rate at a rigure which will injure
i he property of the company. The legal
point upon which so much stress has '
been laid Is not worth a snap. It Is far
from the truth that people, takmg . : van
taf c Â°' a technicality, will not pay their
bills. No large body of people want to
c:nch the company. No rate has been
fixed by this board, because it nas re
scinded its action. We dispute the right
or theiboard to fix a rate, but we want
everything done that is right. Conditions
here differ from those in the East. All
the mat-rial that goes to make gas costs
more. As fast as we can intelligently re
cuce the price we -will 'do so. No one
wants peace and comfort morethan wedo."
Mr. Bishop scouted the Idea that the
board once having-, by resolution, axed
the rate at ?1 10 per thousand feet could
not change that figure for one . ear.
"The man who thinks the rate has been
fixed at $i 10 has a diseased mind," he
said. "It is only the emanation of a dis
eased mind." he continued, "that believes
The board has gained any legal advantage
up to the present time in its controversy
w;th the gas company."
Mayor Phelan was the first to give pub- !
licity to the idea that the board had I
gained a legal advantage. In his bland- I
est tones he asked to whom Attorney
Bishop referredâ ex-City nd County At
torney Creswell; whose opinion he had !
quoted; Judge Coffey. who gave the de
( Isir.n originally, or himself.
"I referred to the man who think* the '
rate is fixed." replied Mr. Bishop. "I bÂ»
lleve the rate was proposed by Supervisor
Holland." said his Honor. In the general
laugh that ensued the harsh remark of
Mr. Bishop was apparently forgotten.
It was intimated during the discussion
that the ?1 10 rate had never legally been
passed. The minutes of the meeting show
that the naming of this rate was only
hv. amendment to the existing ordinance
which flxf'P the price to be charged at :
n75 per thousand feet. Representatives
of the gas company claim that before it
can be adopted and become a law it
must co through the usual course of pass- ;
ing to print, final passage and be signed j
by the Mayor. From this it appears a
new rate can be fixed at any time the
board decides to act.

MANY VESSELS ARE TIED UP
TWO CREWS TAKEN OUT OF THE
BARKENTINE MONITOR.
Police Compelled to Drive Union Men
Away From the Schooner Mary
Buhne â A Union Patrol
man Surprised.
Eight vessels which were anchored off
Meiggs wharf yesterday and the day be
fore have had quite a lively time owing to
the Inability of their captains to secure
crews because of the action of the Sailors'
Union in raising wages by $10 over the ad
vance made by the Shipowners' Associa
tion. The recent departure of the fleet
for the Alaskan canneries has withdrawn
about 6000 men from "the beach," and the
consequence is that sailors are scarce.
Three of the eight vessels managed to
get away yesterday. They -were the
schooner Dora Bluhm. bark C. D. Bry
ant, ard the barkentine Monitor. The five
that remain are the schooner Mary
Buhne. barkentine Mary Winkelman, bark
Prussia, schooner Vine, and schooner
Daisy Rnwp. The Sailors' Union deter
mined that the vess< Is should not =-aii un
less they employed union men. and not
doing bo would have to fight to get away.
Accordingly the Union had their agents
hide among the lumber piles around
Meiggs wharf, and when the "scab" sail
ora made their appearance preparatory to
going aboard they wfr* pounced upon and
badly beaten. Sergeant Bunner and Offl
cer Ferguson were detailed to keep the

union men seemed to have the best of it.
The barkentine Monitor had the worst
time of the fleet. Her captain shipped
different crews before he was able
The union men were de
termined that the Monitor should not sail
with a "scab" crew, and took the desper
ate action of sending two of their num
tfonitor, who threw all the
crew overboard. On the
Mary Buhne matters were getting lively
and Sergeant Bunner and Officer Fergu
- n had to go aboard and drive the union
men off.
("aptain Jensen of the Prussia came

"The trouble l.Â« not of our own mak

owners' Association yesterday. "Early in
the month the members of the associa
tion met and raised the wages of sailors
from $2."> to $30 for coal vessels and from
$30 to $3.t a month for lumber v.
Soon afterward I received a i-ommunica
tion from Andrew Furuseth. secretary of
the Seamen's I'nion of the Pacific Coast.
Btating ; nftt at a meeting of the sailors
it had been decided that wages should
in the fu'ure be $40 for coal and $45 for
lumber vessels, and asking for a confer
ence between the board of directors of
our association and the board of man
agers of the union. I laid the matter be
fore A. M. Simpson, our president: Wil
liam E Mighell. our rice president; Cap
tain Charles Nelson and others. They de
cided that, as owners of the vessels, they
had a right t" fix what wares they were
able to pay. and that a conference was
not necessary. <">f course men are scarce

iway, but I think the association
will be able to keep its end up."
The sailers assert that $40 for coal and
$4.i for lumber vessels Is only a fair wage.

npHE pleasant method and beneficial effects of the well-known remedy, Syrup of Figs, manufactured
A by the California Fig Syrup Company, illustrate the value of obtaining the liquid laxative principles
of plants known to be medicinally laxative and presenting them in the form most refreshing to the tasta
and acceptable to the system. It is the one perfect strengthening laxative,
CLEANSING THE SYSTEM EFFECTUALLY, DISPELLING
COLDS AND HEADACHES, PREVENTING FEVERS,
OVERCOMING HABITUAL CONSTIPATION PERMANENTLY.
Its perfect freedom from every objectionable quality and substance, and its acting on the kidneys,
liver and bowels, gently yet promptly, without weakening or irritating them, make it the ideal laxative.
In the process of manufacturing figs are used, as they are pleasant to the taste, but
THE MEDICINAL QUALITIES ARE OBTAINED FROM SENNA AND OTHER AROMATIC PLANTS,
by a method known to the California Fig Syrup Company only. In order to get its beneficial effects, and
to avoid imitations, please remember the foil name of the Company printed on the front of every package.
Consumers of the choicest products of modern commerce purchase at about the same price that others
pay for cheap and. worthless imitations. To come into universal demand and to be everywhere considered
'he best of its class, an article must be capable of satisfying the wants and tastes of the best informed
purchasers. The California Fig Syrup Company having met with the highest success in the manufacture
â nd sale of its excellent liquid laxative remedy, Syrup of Figs, it has become important to all to have a
knowledge of the Company and its product. The California Fig Syrup Company was organized more than
ifteen years ago, for the special purpose of manufacturing and selling a laxative remedy which would be
more pleasant to the taste and more beneficial in effect than any other known. The great value of the
remedy, as a medicinal agent and of the Company's efforts, is attested by the sale of millions of bottles
annually, and by the high approval of most eminent physicians. . As the true and genuine remedy named
Syrup of Figs is manufactured by the California Fig Syrup Company only, the knowledge of that fact
will assist in avoiding the worthless imitations manufactured by other parties.

FRADSTREET'S FINANCIAL. REVIEW.
NEW* YORK. April 21.â Bradstreet's finan
cial review will to-morrow say:
More or less Irregular tendencies have been
shown In speculation this week. The crop
prospect? have played a considerable part In
determining the drift of sentiment and with
the pending uncertainty about the situation of
the winter wheat and the outlook for the
spring crop there has been an apparent dis
position on the part of the larger Interests in
â Wall street to wait until a clearer view of
the situation can be had. The public Inter
est In the market has fallen off and profes
sional manipulation has been neither bo gen
eral nor pronounced. In fact some of the
traders displayed a readiness to act on the
bear side, though they are quick to cover on
the slightest appearance of danger. The
Granger and Pacific stocks have consequently
been uncertain in their action, while the coal
stocks and some of the railroad specialties
continued to be the objects of bullish sup
port. The industrials, while not neglected,
were by no means as prominent as tnoy have
been for some time past. Money was on
the whole In better supply and showed Increas
ing ease. There is. however, still not a lit
tle discrimination practiced in regard to the
Industrials as collateral for loans and broker
age houses U^ive developed additional conser
vatism about speculative dealings on margin
In them. The week has accordingly been with
out any sensational developments In connection
with the newer class of securities and in the
rather diminished volume ol transactions the
standard stocks have supplied more than their
recent quota of dealing?. London has not been
| a factor of Importance, the only worthy incident
! in the American market there being a rise In
i Anaconda mining shares, said to be due to
I heavy buying for American account.
DUN'S REVIEW OF TRADE.
NEW YORK, April 21.â R. G. Hun <fc fn.'s
weekly review of trade will say to-morrow:
Nothing appears in business or in money mar
kets to prevent continuance of the heaviest
trade ever transacted at good profits. The pay
ment to Spain Is supposed to have caused some
rise In foreign exchange which would amount to
nothing in any case, as balances due from other
countries more than cover the payment, and ad
vance bills against the crop to come forward
In July and later will soon be offered. Loans
on Industrial securities are still at higher rates
than on railway stocks, hut on good commpr-
da! paper or raili ample
. â  â  ' aye stock < â ;â¢â¢â > .i
inj appearance ot pressure The
financing of new corporations has pass
far with less trouble than had br.-Ti feared,
th< !:k-h the completing of s ime organ! zat
hinde: . failed. The usual tim
financial troubles In the spring has passed and
lal alarm about crops has done Its work
and Ftlll industries are undisturbed The one
hindrance in st.*-k speculation Is
the crops, bu( better unofficial reports have
supported inferences warranted by the heavy
r icetpts from the firms in the West and
smith. Farmers do not send wheat or â 
to market In large quantities when crops any
where near them are extensively spoiled. Wheat
receipts have been 7,511,343 bushels, ai
13 last year. In three weeks of April, and
the improvement since April 1 is worthy of
notice. Exports have fallen off amounting
from both coasts to only 8,774,774 bushels. Hour
Included. In three weeks, against 10,919.122 last
year, and the price closes but half a cent higher
"than last week.
Nothing but industrial depression is left to
apprehension, but the Industries are
meeting something very unlik.- depre slon. The
kind of "lull" that adpears in the iron market
rejoices the manufacturers, because they are
crowded far ahead with orders. It means, very
true, that many buyers do not want i
tract far ahead at the high prices now asked,
H'l'l alÂ«s that many orders have been for a
time withdrawn. It nisi. ni"ans that manufac
turers who ar" so crowded that little new imsi
taken are anxious to get nearer the
I their engagements before fixinc prices
for the future. Almost nothing is don< In pig
iron, though Pout hern is sold largely at
cai-o and Pittsburg. Heavy demands for bars
to be used in car ami other works cam
met at Chicago. Plate mills there and else
where are refusing orders. Contracts foi
to 10,000 tons structural work at I'ittshurg and
Rome at Chicago are taken, though many others
are deferred, and shots i
th<! works are generally too crowded. The coke
tlon Is still close to the maximum.
London speculation lifted tin to 2!
Of 4440 tons arrived here, and copper Is very
strong and scarce at 18% C for J,ak<\ wll
tons brought back from Europe, though the
United States production was only 21, y. -
In March.
Men who have held wool stiffly for more than
a year are selling freely at bottom prices, ad
mittedly the lowest of th" year Sales at three
chief markets in two weeks have been 23,204,
--285 pounds, of which 17,37.>;, were domestic,
against 16,906,100 founds In 1892. Territory wool,
pounds, was sold for export to England,
and 1,260,000 pounds Australian In bond, which
has been held here fifteen months, fine \v, H >l
being very high there, while crossbred Is so
low that It cannot be Import Â»d. With assur
ance of better prospects for poods, woolen
manufacturers are waiting for the effect on
various combinations. The demand is not at
present very large, and considerable machin
ery Is Idle. Cotton has advanced 'te. An ad
vance nf i^r in BOHM It*
significant and may Influence other prices.
Failures for the week have been 1M in the
United Stales, against 204 last year, and 22 in
Canada, against 29 last year.
BRADSTREET'S ON TRADE CONDITION'S.
NEW YORK, April 21.â Bradstreefs to-mor
row will say: The general business situation
Is one of quiet strength, while in industrial
lines activity continues unabated. The uni
versal testimony of damage to the winter
wheat crop has had surprisingly little effect
on prices as yet, owing partly to Improved
weather conditions strengthening the hope* of
a larger area in spring wheat and also to good
crop reports abroad and increased visible sup
plies, as compared with a year ago, encourag
ing foreign buyers In their neglect of American
offerings. An enlarged demand for this coun
try's manufactured products in some degree
counterbalanced, the falling off In the value of
agricultural exports, notably cereals and cot
ton, as compared with a year mc". For
the month of March a drop of 118,000,000 In
exports of breadstuffs, cotton, provisions, live
cattle and mineral oils has been partly made
up by a gain of nearly $10,000,000 in other prod
ucts, leaving the net deficiency, as compared
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, APRIL 22, 1899.
with a year ago, 7 per cent. Imports reflect the
Increased purchasing power of the country',
the total for March, In fact, being the largest
since May, 1 5;.7 For the nine months' period
ex| irts, us a whole, are a little less than double
the im;^ rts.
In iron and steel new business is of even
sniiiller proportions, a notable exception, how
ever, being in tho line of wire goods and nails,
on which prices have been very generally ad
vanced. Quotations of plglron, steel billets and
nearly afl the cruder forms are firmly held,
while for many finished products, such as
plates and bars, even higher quotations are
asked. Mi 11k and furnaces are reported crowded
â¢with business on earlier orders and the dispo
sition of buyers to delay placing their busl
n.-ss for the latter part of the year Is reported
as viewed with equanimity. The cotton goods
situation is still a strong one, though the cur
rent demand from agents Is light. Retail dis
tribution of staple products has been Improved
by more favorable weather, thus encouraging
hopes of future good re-orders from wholesale
hands. Following the outburst of activity In
wool last week's business has rather fallen
off, but values remain steady. Continued buy-
Ing of high grades of foreign wool fur export
i- reported and there j B s^nie talk of high
grade American wools being bought tor ship
ment to England. Following an advance early
in the week, due to good foreign advices and
smaller than expected crop movement, cotton
la quieter, but holds part of the advance. The
strength of rnw sugars Is a notable feature.
Abroad quotations of beet sugar have been ad
vanced, while the (^iban yield is not expect.' l
to be largo and Bradstreet's advices point to
not more than half an average crop beins
grown in Louisiana. Raw sugar Is higher on
the week, but refined lags behind, though con
sumption is enormous. The demand for lumber
at wholesale continues good and the Southern
industry seems to be sharing to the full In the
svnrTHl prosperity. Retailers, however, report
buyers slow to pay the advanced quotations.
Leather and hides are stronc and boots and
Bhoes hold recent advances.
Wheat, including flour, shipments for the
week aggregate 2,982,969 bushels, against 1,988,
--619 last week, 3.232.105 in the corresponding week
Of 1898, 1,664.668 in 1C97. 1,286 490 in IS9H and
2,431.634 in 1896. Since July 1, this season, the
exports of wheat aggregate 193,262, 1TS bushels,
apainst 191.5Q3.655 last year.
Business failures show a notable falling off
from those of last week, aggregating 187,
against 243 in the preceding week. 224 in this
we.^k a -year ago, 216 in 1897, 240 In 1896 and

CALIFORNIA PRUNES IN NEW YORK.
NEW YORK, April 21.â The Journal of Com
merce says: The principal feature in the Cali
fornia prune market is renewed inquiry from
European exporters. The report that the
French crop has been seriously damaged by
late frosts, coupled with the statement that
handlers in France have recalled stocks held
in England, Germany and elsewhere on the
Continent on commission, has. it is stated,
caused European and English buyers to attain
turn their attention to California poods. There
have already been sales made of several cars
to go to Germany and negotiations are said
to be pending for the purchase of a number
or additional cars by exporters, but the con
culslon of transactions has been delayed, we
understand, owing to the difference in views
of buyers and sellers. There are said to be
'. other and quite numerous export Inquiries, but
: In view of the comparatively small stocks on
spot â  0 large business, it is held, is likely to
occur, whether buyers finally come up to sell
! ers' prices or the latter agree to accept the
! bids of buyers.
' The spot demand for California prunes is
fairly active, but It is of hand-to-mouth char
i acter and Jobbers seem to be doing; most of
1 the business and the market Is somewhat un

HIDES. TALLOW, WOOL AND HOPS.
The circular of Jacob Wollner says: "ThÂ»rÂ«
has been a good deal of wool selling In the
last two weeks, principally fall wool and defec
tive springs, also some Nevadas. There has
also been quite a movement In scoured wools,
but at low prices. In new spring wools very
little has been done so far. Some few lots
of spring from southern foothills have been
sold from 7c to SVic. Fall wools range from
4Vtc to 7c.
"The lower part of the San Joaquln Valley
is nearly through shearing and a good deal
of new wools, also last year's spring and fall,
which remained In growers' . hands, have been
bought up, year's staple bringing from fir
to 7c, six months' wool from 5c to 7c. The new
clip is not in very good condition, most of the
wools showing a cocklebur, and It is rather
dark, owing to the long dry spell in the early,
part of the winter. Very few foothills or
northern wools have come in so far.
"The price for scoured wool has not ad
vanced and whenever a cent per pound or more
Is asked it stops the sale. In Nevada the early
shearing is nearly finished, and the wools are
In fair condition and art' selling at S@loc.
"In the Eastern market, especially in Bop
ton, there have been large transactions, but at
lower prices than have prevailed since the
early part of 1897. It seems the manufacturers
have their own way, no speculation is going
on and wools are only bought as they are
wanted, and If the seller asks a higher price
it stops the sale. The woolen goods market
is still not very active and at the prices wool
en goods are sold now it seems that wool can
not advance materially for some time, as
manufacturers say that if they cannot buy
wools at their own price they will use cotton,
and as they have machinery wherewith they
can use cotton the product shows as well as
all-wool grades. .. -
"The Kuropean market Is high and advanc
ing especially for fine merinos, owing to their
scarcity on account of the, drought In Austra
lia, and we are selling to-day wools that were
Imported and are in bond, also foreign wools
which were brought in before the tariff went
into effect, also some long staple domestic
wools for export.
"The wool market closed with a fair demand.
"Mutton sheep and also lambs and stock
sheep are bringing high prices and can be
quoted from $3*34 per head for old stock and
$2112 60 for lambs."

WATER RATES ARE
SHARPLY ADVANCED
T\ye Ordinance Recently Enacted a Scheme
of the "Solid Six."
OAKLAND, April 21. â There Is a section In the -water
ordinance thai will go Into effect in July which will be
a surprise to that large class of residents who use water
by meter. It means an Increase of 20' per cent on the water
ratos in vogue before the "solid Blx" passed the celebrated ordinance
last year that provoked several riots. The difference was only discovered
to-day by a ratepayer who visited the City Hall to ascertain If the water
rate Is to ncreased.
The increase Is the result of a little jugglery to which the people are
of the difference between 1000 gallons of water and 100
.â¢; w iter, and this difference is about 25 per cent. â¢
In â  Manuel ordinance, which was introduced and passed
durintr Dr niÃtration, the rate for meters was fixed at 20 cents
per thousand gallons. The "solid six" ordinance of last year fixed the rate
a 1 ;;,, hundred cubic feet This was the first time water had been
measured by 100 which Is about 7SO gallons, and made the rate
about 40 cents per thousand gallons.
A few ' : Â°uncH passed an ordinance which was not favored
I the "six," and it provides for a rate of "26 cents for 100 cubic
- is equal to a rate of about 34 cents for 1000 gallonsâ nearly

CONTINUANCE FOR LUCAS.
Judge Mogan Postpones the Extor-
tion Case Until Wednesday.
Owing to a crowded calendar, Judge
Mogan yesterday continued the case of
Albert E. Lucas, the detective, now under
arrest on complaint of J. F. Turner for
the crime of attempted extortion, until
next Wednesday at 2 o'clock. When the
case was first called before Judge Mogan,
Judge Aitken, who represented the ac
cused, made a motion for a continuance
for one week. George W. Collins, special
counsel for the prosecution, objected and
the motion was denied. Judge Aitken then
told the court that Lucas would have to
ill tend himself without an attorney if the
motion was denitd.
Judge Mogan asked the attorney If he
meant tt> withdraw from the case, and
was answered in the affirmative in event
the case was not continued. The court
denied the motion. Aitken withdrew and
Judge Mogan appointed Judge Webb to
represent the deserted detective. Lucas,
with a bewildered expression on his face,
then walked to the bar and pleaded for a
few more days' time. The court Informed
the detective that a half-hour was at his
disposal to discuss his case with counsel,
and when the half hour passed Lucas was
again called to the bar.
Turner took the stand to identify the
letters written to him by .Lucas demand
ing the payment of a large sum of money
and ending with a threat of some un
known kind of exposure if the demand
whs was not complied with. This closed
the Hide of the prosecution in the Police
Court. A continuance of a week was then
granted to tho defendant and yesterday
the case was again continued until
Wednesday for the further consideration
of the court.

NEW RULING IN
THE HOMER-ALKI
COLLISION CASE
Seattle Inspectors Are
Reversed.
BERMINGHAM IS OUTSPOKEN
SATS THE BLAME WAS PLACED
ON THE WEONG MAN.
Suits for Damages Against the Ho
mer Will Now Be Dropped and
New Ones Against the
Al-Ki Will Follow.
____
The decision of Captain John Bermtng
ham, United States Inspector of Hulls and
Boilers, in the Homer-Al-Ki collision
case was made public on the front yester
day. The document was sent to Seattle,
1 but as it gives the local inspectorsâCap
tain W. J. Bryant, Inspector of Hulls,
! and C." C. Cherry, Inspector of Boilersâ
; a severe keel-hauling, they have kept the
â  matter to themselves and no Information
may be expected from that source.
The collision took place on the night of
January 20, 1899. After hearing the testi
mony the local Inspectors suspended Cap
tain G. M. Jesson of the Homer for thlrty
days and exonerated Captain J. W. Gage
of the Al-Ki. The case was appealed to
the Supervising Inspector, and after a
careful perusal of the testimony he finds
that Jesson was not to blame, and says
further that Captain Gnge should have
been suspended for six months.
On the night in question the Homer
backed out from Schwabaeher's wharf at
Seattle. The night was clear, and when
600 yards away from the wharf Captain
Jesson and the pilot saw a steamer light
about half a mile away. This steamer
later proved to be the Al-Ki. Between
the two was the British man-of-war
Pheasant. The Homer blew one whistle.
Captain Jesson signifying that he would
go to starboard. This signal was prompt
ly answered from the Al-Ki, and the Ho
mer proceeded to pass inside the Pheas
ant, Captain Jesson naturally thinking
the Al-Ki would pass on the outside. In
stead of that the Al-Kl rounded the
Pheasant's stern at fuil speed. As soon
as the Homer caught sight of the Al-Kl
bearing down on her Captain Jesson blew
the danger signal and then came the
crash. Both vessels were almost wrecked
from the force of the collision. Captain
Gage testified that he heard the Homers
whistle, but thought it was a steamer en
tering her slip.
After reviewing the evidence Captain
Bermingham goes on to say:
"Much of the testimony in this case as
to distance will not stand the test of
mathematical analysis. During the hear
ing of the case by the lower court the
appellant (Captain Jesson of the Homer;
was critically examined as to why he did
not keep out of the way or the Al-Ki af
ter she rounded the stern of the Pheas
ant. Strange as it may seem, the master
Of the Al-Ki was not questioned as to
why he came around close to the Pheas
ant's stern In the dead of night at full
speed. True, h ered the state
ment that he always came from Four
mile Rock in the night at full Bpeed,
hi ading a Foutheast course for a certain
light on Schwaba'h<r's wharf, where he
lined up at reduced speed for his berth,
which it appears was about 500 yards
away, about four points to the south
ward. But had he further stated to the
court (which asserted that such was the
common practice of all steamers entering
the harbor of Seattle) that he proposed
hereafter to discontinue such methods of
navigation the commercial community
of that region would no doubt have felt
greatly relieved; but as matters now
stand there is some doubt as to his fu
ture procedure when nearing the water
front of Seattle at night, unless it should
occur to the local board to gently inti
mate to him that while such haste to save
a minute or two in getting to his wharf
might be agreeable to himself and own
ers, it would be correspondingly disagree
able to other vessels which might perforce
be navigating those waters at night.
"1 quite agree with the board that there
seems to be no reasonable excuse for the
collision,' but I do not agree with them
that the Homer should have taKen the
sevtrn.i miles of clear water outside the
warship, which they say she should have
taken. She chose â and very properly soâ
the Inside course, and It was natural from
the appellant's (Captain Jesaon) point of
view to suppose that the Al-Ki would
have taken the outside, as she had an
swered his signal. Had the Al-Ki been
slowed down at the moment, as she
should have been, especially when she
could not see whence the signal of the
Homer came, there would have been no
collision, as the Al-Ki would then have
approached the Homer at such speed as
to be more readily controlled by her
master.
"It is not true that had the Homer gone !
even llfty feet farther ahead or nearer j
the dock the Al-Ki would have cleared !
her. The appellant (Captain Jesson) could I
not be expected at that time to know j
Just where the Al-Ki was going, as she
had come around the stern of the Pheas- !
ant, showing her gTeen light. It is quite I
likely the appellant would have taken the !
out6ide route had he supposed the Al-Ki
was going to take the lneide one, but
after she accepted his signal he could not
do so. â¢ * â¢
"The lower court held that the appel
lant (Captain Jesson) was by rule 2 of
the rules and regulations governing pi
lots, fifth position, obligated to keep out
of the way of the Al-Kl. because the
latter showed her green light on tho port
side of the Homer. It is not clear to me
how the appellant could have observed
the rule quoted and keep out of the way
of the Al-Ki, as the Homer had but
little way on her. When the gTeen light
of the Al-Kl was shown that vessel was
answering her port helm at considerable
speed, which apparently left the appel
lant in doubt as to whether he should
keep out of her way by backing or going
ahead. The lifth provision of rule '1 ap
plies when vessels are approaching each
other somewhat near on parallel lines on
about a four point course, and not when
a vessel exposing her green light to the
starboard side of the other is swinging
to her port helm close aboard of such
other vessel. The Homer under the cir
cumstances was not in a position to ob
serve such rule, and, consequently, as it
appears to me, could not avoid the Al-Ki,
which came on at full speed (and blindly
so far as the Homer was concerned) up
to a moment before the collision.
"Therefore 1 hold that the master of
the Al-Ki, J. W. Gage, was at fault and
should have his licerifse suspended for six
months, and not the appellant. Hence the
lower court erred in suspending the li
cense of tho appellant (Captain Jesson),
as it did, for thirty days from February
G, 1599."
This decision will raise a rumpus in
Seattle, as the owners of the Al-Ki have
assessed the Homer for damages, while
the owners of merchandise in both steam
ers have begun suit to recover the value
of them from the Homer's owners. All
these suits will how have to be dismissed
and new ones begun against the owners
of the Al-Kl. The owners of the latter
vessel have no appeal, but the Seattle
local Inspectors can carry the matter
before the Board of Supervising Inspect
ors at its next meeting, and this will
probably be done.

DONOVAN AND
THE NEW SQUAD
IN CHINATOWN
Were on Active Duty
Bright and Early.
A DAY OF INSPECTION
LIEUTENANT ESOLA DISPOSED
TO AID THE SERGEANT.
Both Agree to Work Togetherâ The
Fire Department Begins the Dis
ciplining of Inhabitants
of the Quarter.
Sergeant Donovan and his now squad \
â¢were in the Oriental quarter bright ami >
early yesterday morning. The sergeant j
proceeded nt once to familiarize himself j
with the situation, and before nightfall j
he had succeeded in spotting several of j
the gambling resorts. Many of the Chi- ;
nese merchants in the quarter who are
friendly to the police made themselves
acquainted with the new sergeant and
furnished valuable hints that will aid him
In his work. Donovan has never been
detailed in Chinatown before, but as he
is an 'experienced officer he should not be ;
long In learning the ropes.
Lieutenant Isola visited Chinatown \
shortly after noon and held a lengthy \
conference with Sergeant Donovan. The j
lieutenant assured Donovan that he would i
give him all the assistant i possible in j
lils efforts to suppress gambling and keep |
the peace. Esola. being thoroughly fa- J
miliar with every nook and corneT of j
Chinatown will be a valuable ally to the j
new sergeant. Both officials talked over i
the situation and went over the ground j
together Esola pointing out the leading :
gambling resorts and otherwise giving j
Donovan suggestions.
For at least a week Sergeant Donovan
and his iuad, who, by the way, are |
stalwart policemen, weighing close to the i
Â£<W-pounrt mark, will spend their time get- ;
ting acquainted with the devious ways of j
the Chinese and the places In which they !
congregate. Then they will commence a
systematic onslaught on the gambling re- j
When the new squad reported to the
sergeant yesterday morning he instructed
them at length on the situation as far as
he knew it and impressed upon their
minds the importance of the work they '
have been selected to perform. The squad ,
consists of five of the . indent policemen I
in the department; and Sergeant Donovan ;
will make it a point to keep three of them
In the quarter at all times. It any unfore- j
seen contingencies arise which render this ;
arrangement impossible Donovan will
draw upon the California-street station
for reinforcements. The sergeant and his
new squad spent the day patrolling the
alleys and inspecting the various so-called
merchants' clubs, many of which are ;
nothing but full-fledged gambling resorts j
No obstacles ... re placed in the waylof ;
the squad on their tour. The doors of the |
gambling resorts were thrown wide open i
and every room was deserted.
While the Police Department is dally- ;
ing with the Oriental quarter, the Fire
Department is not idle Chief Sullivan Is
mined to force the Inhabitant! of I
Chinatown to tear down all obstructions j
that are liable to harass the work or en- :
danger the men in Ins department. As
sistant Chief John Dougherty has been
in Chinatown since last Tuesday. order
ing the occupants of the ramshackle â 
buildings to remove the bars on their j
windows. kyllghts and doors, and to tear
down cupboards, flimsy awnings and
other obstacles that stand in the way â 
of the liremen. The task is by no means
a pleasant or easy one, as the Chinese
have always been accustomed to liar their
windows and doors, and when the assist
ant chief orders them to take obstacles
down they chatter like a cage of mon
keys, and in many cases flatly refuse to
obey the mandate.
Dougherty has an intelligent Chinaman j
on his staff and uses him to good advan
tage. Every time a Chinaman attempts
to seek refuge behind the proverbial "No
sabe," the assistant chief winks knowing
ly t.i his trusty Interpreter and says:
"Hen one of them 'no sabe' fellows:
ask him if he sabee a ride In the patrol

STRUCK DOWN
IN CHURCH BY A
CHOIR SINGER
Bloodthirsty Assault Made With
a Keen Hatchet Upon an
Old Man.
Patrick Donovan, in Full View of the Con
gregation, Attacks and Fatally In
jures Alex Jardine.
PA. DONOVAN, who sings In trie
choir of St. Rose's Church at
Fourth and rannan streets, made
1 a brutal assault on Alexander Jar
dine, aged 77 years, with a hatchet last
evening. The assault took place in the
vestibule of the sacred edifice. The
â wounded man lies in a critical condition
in the Receiving Hospital, while his bru
tal assailant Is locked up in the City
Prison with a charge of an assault to
commit murder recorded against his
name.
The church was crowded at the time,
and as Donovan sneaked up behind his
aged victim and struck him several times
with a hatchet the greatest excitement
prevailed.
Several men who were present, seeing
the old man fall, the result of a severe
blow on the head, seized the -infuriated
choir-singer and after a short struggle
succeeded in disarming- him. He was
then held until a policeman arrived, who.
after handcuffing him, took him to the
City Prison.
Donovan claims he has been connected
with the choir of St. Rose's Church for
fonio time. At the conclusion of -the ser
vices last evening lie left the choir loft
11 nd started to leave the church. As he
reached the door he espied his old vic
tim, who was also in the act of emerging
from the sacred edifice. Sneaking up be
hind him Donovan took out a freshly
ground hatchet, which he had concealed
in his pantaloons, and without a word of
warning brought it down on the old
man's head. As his helpless victim
staggered against the wall of the church
Donovan again struck him. cutting an
ugly- gash in the back of his head. With
blood streaming from the gaping wounds
Jardine turned around as if to face the j
enraged choir-singer and received another
Ll"\v on the side of his head.
The congregation, which was composed
largely of women, seemed transfixed with
horror and made no effort to disarm the
hatchet wielder. As Donovan raised the
hatchet to again strike his victim sev
eral of the male members of the congre
gation s-ized him and prevented him
from furtner injuring Jin-dine. The
wounded man had fallen on the steps and
was bleeding profusely from three cuts In
the head and one in the neck. The am
bulance was at once summoned and the
unfortunate man hastily removed to the
Receiving Hospital.
Dr. Maher, who examined him, found
that one of the cuts on the top of the
head had penetrated the skull, causing a
compound fracture. Part of his left ear
was gone, having been chopped off by the
infuriated man. On account of his ad
vanced years, it is doubtful if he re
covers.
When seen in his cell in the City Prison ]
Donovan readily consented to tell the
story of the assault.
"I'm sorry 1 did not kill him." he re
marked after being told that Jai dine was
still alive. "He has persecuted me long
enough. For over twenty years he has
dogged my footsteps, frequently declar
ing his intention of killing me.
"I meant to do him up and am sorry
that I did not succeed. whenever I was
engaged to sing in church choirs Jardine
would follow me and induce the leader to

THE SAIST FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, APRIL 22, 1899.
THE GOVERNOR
MAY APPOINT
THE SENATOR
The News of Quay's
Selection.
TALK OF THE POLITICIANS
CALIFORNIA AND PENNSYLVA
NIA CASES ARE IDENTICAL.
Should Quay Be Seated at Washing
ton a Senator Appointed by-
Gage Would Probably Be
Admitted.
The press dispatch announcing that the
Governor of Pennsylvania hap appointed
Matthew s. Quay to be United States
Senator from that Btate caused much con
jecture among leading politicians of Cal
ifornia as to what course Governor Gage
will pursue in regard to the Senatorial
vacancy resulting from the failure of our
Legislature to elect a. successor of Ste
phen M. White. There is but little differ
ence between the Pennsylvania and Cali
fornia situations. Jf the United Stater.
Senate admits Quay there can scarcely be
any ground for denying admission to a
Senator appointed by Governor Gage to
nen sent this commonwealth until the
Legislature again convenes. The question
a< issue cannot be determined until the
I'nited States Senate convenes and that
event will not take place until next De
cember unless the President shall in the
meantime call an extra session of Con
press.
Judge Dibble was interviewed last even
ing and expressed the opinion that the
California and Pennsylvania cases were
almost identical and that if the United
States Senate admitted Quay a Senator
fmm this Stat^ appointed by Governor
would be seated. He did not at
tach any significance to the fad that dur
-â â¢veral days of (he session of the
Pennsylvania Legislature members re
mained away from Harrisburg to prevent
a quorum from being present. He main-
Gage Surely Conk! Not
Have Had This Man in
Mind When He Wrote
His Message to the
Legislature !
tamed, however, that the United States
Senate would be obliged to reverse its de
cision In recent casts if Quay were
seated.
So many politicians believe that Gover
nor Gage will follow- the example of Gov
ernor Stone of Pennsylvania that there
is much conjecture concerning the kind
of man that will be appointed to repre
sent California. The touts are already
predicting- that IHirns will pet the. com
mission.
In the message which Governor Gape
sent to the Legislature on the last day
of the lutit; session he drew a picture of
the kind of a Senator he desired the
legislators to elect, and it is presumed he
will appoint as poo<l a man as he re
commended tlie members to elect. Here
is the closing paragraph of the message
that was received during the expiring
hours of the session and too late for con
sideration:
"I implore you to falter no
longer in the discharge qf your
high duty; to select for the
State a proper representative for
the United States Senate; to rise
above the antagonisms which
have been engendered during
your long session, and to choose
for the people a man fully
equipped, mentally and morally,
for the great office of United
States Senator, a man of distin
guished abilities and virtue, a
man in whom the people will
perceive just grounds for confi
dence, a man who will best sub
serve our commercial and politi
cal interests and represent the
dignity of our people."
When the foregoing paragraph was
read to the assembled legislators there
was a good deal of comment to the effect
that the description of the Senator de
sired by the Cove.rnor did not fit Burns.
The special reference to the mental and
moral equipment seemed to give Dan the
double cross and signify ti.at he was not
in the calculation at either end. In the
further reference to a Senator of dis
tinguished abilities and virtue the most
Banguine and hopeful tout did not recog
nize a picture of the "colonel."
Last oveninK Governor Gage at Sacra
mento was asked whether he intended' to
appoint a Senator to fill the existing va
cancy, but he declined to be interviewed
on the subject.

STRUCK ON THEIR HEADS,
BUT NOT SERIOUSLY HURT
Two Babes Have Severe Falls, but
Miraculously Escape Death.
TWO small children fell from
considerable heights yesterday
and landed on their heads, but,
strange to say, both are ex
pected to recover.
The nine-months-old son of Mr.
and Mrs. Jam"? Rue, 211Â°> Clement avenue, Alameda, fell from
a kitchen window, a distance of ten feet, and landed squarely
on its head upon an asphalt pavement. The child was in the
care of its sister, who sat it on a table near ;i window. While her
back was turned the baby crawled to the window and fell headlong to the
pavement. Dr. E. M. Keys, who was called in, found the child's head was
bruised, bul there was nn concussion. The child is expected to recover.
Little two year-old Rldna Peter?, while Bhopping with her parents at Hol
brook, Merrill & Stetson's, fell from the second story landing of the ware
house, a distance of thirteen feet, striking upon her bead. The child was
leriousl; Injured. Edna was unconscious for some time and was taken
to the Harbor Hospital, where she was treated. I>r. Pltzgibbon attended
the little one and advised her parents to take the child home and have their
regular physician attend to her. Only a slight liruise on the temple showed
where Edna's head had struck. Mr. and Mrs. Peters are from Atnador.
BUNKOED A STRANGER.
Emil Westphal From New Jersey
Loses His Money on a Pre
tended Horse Race.
Two bunko men, T. J. Morgan and Wil
liam Stevens, were cleverly captured yes
terday morning by Detectives Dinan
and Reynolds and booked at the City
Prison to await their removal to Oak
land.
Thursday morning another of the gang â¢
met Kmil Westphal, a recent arrival
from New Jersey, stopping at the New-
Atlantic Hotel, and took him to a saloon
on Stockton street, where Kmil was in
duced to shake dice with the stranger.
He lost $60, but when it was hinted that
a policeman would be called in he g_ot
back $50, the sal. ion man keeping $io for
luck. A few minutes later Kmil was ap
proached by Stevens, who led him to the !
ferry on the promise that he would get
him a position in a grocery in Oakland.
On the boat Morgan, who said he was a !
jockey, joined them, and Kmil was per- ;
i to give the "jockey" $."oâ all the
money he had -to bet On a race, as it
would be a sure thing.
They went to the racetrack, and in due
time Kmil was told that the horse had
lost and his $50 was gone. Stevens came j
back to the city with Kmil after prom- j
Ising to get him a position with a fic
titious grocer, and then dropped him. >

quarters yesterday morning, and in less
than an hour Dinan and Reynolds ar- |
rested Stevens and Morgan on Powell
