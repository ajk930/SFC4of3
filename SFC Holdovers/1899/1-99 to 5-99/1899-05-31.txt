VOLUME LXXXV-NO. 18ti.
FOR hours yesterday the streets
of the city echoed to the steady
tread of marching men. They
marched as if for a holiday; as
if to celebrate a victory. They started
at the water front, where flags waved
In their honor and people shouted and
â  beared from sheer enthusiasm, and to
the music of bands playing their live
liest the column moved on up the
street Wherever it went the flags flut
tered joyously over it, unmindful of the
fact that they hung at half-mast, and
then with the thrill of the cheer still In
?hÂ»ir blood, the men who formed the
column turned through a flag-draped
ay and halted among hekdstones
in a graveyard. They had come with a
FmiLe to celebrate the victory of death
and to do honor to the comrades who
had fought the grinning specter and
had lost
Decoration day had more than its
usual share of people. Where formerly
there was one, yesterday there were
four, and the flowers they brought told
better than words that they had seen
something in the day that was new to
them. The change in the significance
was the theme of the addresses deliver
ed, the prayers said and the songs
sung. There was no blue, no gray;
there was only the living and the dead,
and the living tried to pay their debt
In the only way they knew. Since Ma
nila Bay was filled with wrecks and the
shores of Cuba were strewn with Snan
ish vessels both North and South oan
meet over the flowered mounds and for
get what hand they had in making
them; and it was in that spirit the
people turned toward the cemeteries
yesterday and found pleasure in the so
ciety of the departed.
At the Presidio George H. Thomas
Post of the Grand Army held ceremon
ies more of praise than of sorrow; in
the soldiers' plat of the Odd Fellows'
Cemetery the other posts of the city
Fathered and drew from their surround
ings lessons of patriotism and of man
hood, but not of grief. There was noth
ing of mourning in either place; those
gathered around were doing honor to a
memory, not weeping over men who
had gone. They were swayed by the
pplrit that so recently filled the
army with the best blood of the States
âthe idea that a hero's death is worth
a life of ease.
The whole city was not at the ceme
teries, however. There were those who
took the day as a holiday and acted
accordingly. The kvenues of egress
from the city were thronged in the
morning, and they caught the crowds
reversed in the evening. The bay was
dotted with yachts and the park had
its moving thousands. But with it all
it was Memorial day, and it has taught
a better lesson than many that have
passed. . ;
HOW THE PARADE
WENDED ITS WAY
Notable Absence of Military Bodies,
and an Unusual Number of Chil
dren in Line.
There were two features of the pa
rade noticeable to the crowds which
thronged street and sidewalk. One was
the small portion of. the column occu
pied by the military and the other was
the large portion devoted to children.
The first may be explained by the war
and the second as well by the war, for
the parade had all of the Fourth of
July flavor and the children's enthu
m was one of its principal charms.
It was unlike former Memorial day pa
rades. There are not many troops here
now, and all the available men are
leaving for the Philippines, so but a
portion of the Twenty-fourth Regular
Infantry, the militia, cavalry and the
Naval Militia were the only military
organizations represented.
The parade was headed by a battalion
The San Francisco Call.
of police under command of Chief Lees.
Following these were the grand mar
shal and his aids and staff, and then
came the militia cavalry.
The Twenty-fourth Infantry, under
command of Colonel H. B. Freeman, j
marched after the cavalry, and after
the Twenty-fourth was the Naval Mili
tia. A feature of the parade of the Na
val Militia was the battery of four guns
furnished by the divisions of San Fran- |
Cisco, under command of Lieutenant j
W. F. Burke. It was in just such a !
formation as appeared in the parade j
yesterday that the Naval Militia of this
State desired to be mustered into serv
ice during the late war. The battery
is as powerful a one as any that served,
and from the peculiar tactics that ob
tain in the navy it can be made much
more efficient than such a battery
formed under the army regulations; in
fact, the army tactics provide for no
such formation. In the column of the
Naval Militia there was also a detach
ment from the division at Santa Cruz,
which came up on a special train to
take part with the city divisions.
The civic bodies, independent com
panies,, the semi-military organizations
and the children then took up the line
and ran from the Independent Rifles
down to the Board of Supervisors. At
the head of the children's part of the
column was the Columbia Park Boys'
Club, with nearly a hundred in uni
form; then after the Native Sons of
Vermont, the State of Maine Associa
tion, the Ohio Society and the Fraternal
Order of Eagles, the various companies
of school children came. They all wore
distinctive uniforms, and in many there
was an evident desire to have arrange
ments as nearly military as possible.
The Columbia School showed its origin
ality by having at the end of its com
pany an ambulance drawn by two
goats, and following it a Bed Cross

THE NATIONS'S TRIBUTE
nurse, little Sophie Newman, dressed
in the uniform of the society.
There was no end to the line of chil
dren, and they marched like veterans.
There were boys and girls by the hun
dred, and at the head of each school
column was borne a banner telling
what division was passing. They re
ceived great applause as they followed
down after the military.
The Sons of Veterans were on hand in
great numbers and so were the veterans
of the Spanish War. and then at the
end of it all the posts of the Grand
Army took their place.
It was as large a turnout of veterans
as has been seen in the city for a long
time. There were five posts represent
ed â Lincoln, Garfield. Cass. Meade and
Liberty â and the old men marched
from the place of rendezvous to the re
viewing station without a falter.
The officers of the day, with the
Board of Supervisors and the Board of
Education, took up the extreme- end of
the line.
There was no waiting for the start.
The parade was advertised to move at
10 o'clock, and at that hour the grand
marshal moved up Market street, led
by the police and followed by fully five
thousand men and children in line. Up
the street went the parade, greeted
from every window with cheers and the
Happing of flags and acompanied by the
music of every band the city could af
ford for the occasion. There was plenty
of music and the bands were willing,
and the course of the procession was a
mingled chorus of brazen notes and the
cheers of thousands.
Turning out Golden Gate avenue, the
parade passed up to Van Ness avenue,
and on the corner of Turk street it was
reviewed by Colonel Freeman of the
Twenty-fourth Infantry. /Then, while
the various organizations disentangled
themselves from the column and sought
their homes the veterans and those who
wanted to see and hear what was to
happen at the cemetery boarded the
cars and made their way out to where
the speaker's stand had been erected in
the soldiers' plot of the Odd Fellows.
The veterans and a platoon of artillery
from the Naval Militia were the only
organigations in formation, but the
crowds were large enough to make up
any lack of order, and the line of vet
erans, the last of the parade, disappear-
Ed through the cemetery gate, hemmed
in by a solid wall of humanity.
MEMORIAL EXERCISES
AT THE PRESIDIO
Thousands of patriotic Americans jour
neyed out to the Presidio reservation yes
terday to view the pageant of marching
soldiery and participate in the Memorial
day exorcises conducted by George H.
Thomas Post No. 2, G. A. R., over the
graves of Its dead in the National Ceme
tery. Long before the arrival of the ad
vance guard of sightseers, the burying
ground which has been set apart to re
ceive the remains of departed soldiers and
sailors had been visited by friends and
relatives of the departed, bearing flowers
of all varieties, which they deposited on -
the little mounds of earth or entwined
about the marble headstones that marked
the last resting place of their ' beloved
ones, transforming â¢ the graveyard" into a
veritable floral garden.
When, the members of Thomas Post and
other organizations who' participated in
the memorial exercises arrived at the en
trance to the Presidio, at 10:30 a. m. they
found drawn up to receive them a guard
of honor composed of a detachment of
the Twenty-fourth Infantry. U. S. A.

Other Organizations and Guest*.
The soldiers and civilians who marched
in the ranks, afoot and on horseback, fol
lowed by carriages In which were the
guests of honor, presented a brilliant and
imposing- spectadle as they slowly wended
their way along the winding road. The
thousands of spectators who thronged the
sides of the avenues stood silent, many
of them with bared heads, as the proces
sion moved forward, the mournful music
of the band of the Fourth United States
Cavalry, which led the way, seemiiiK to
command reverence, even from those who
on ordinary occasions are most irrever
ent.
Arriving at the cemetery, the detach
ments from the battleship lowa, the re
ceiving ship Pensacola and the regular
troops deflected toward the monument
erected to the soldiers and sailors, where
services were held under the direction or
John F. Fitzgerald, while the main body,
including the veterans of the Mexican and
civil wars, the naval battalion and the
League of the Cross Cadets continued on
its way up the slope to the little natural
amphitheater, where the remains of the
post's dead are buried. Here a stand for
the speakers and those who were to t ; i k .
a more active part in the ceremonies had
been erected, and to it the speakers were
conducted, while- the others grouped
themselves around and in front. Numer
ous delegations of veterans were detailed
to atrevr Rowers over the graves of the
dead, which duty they performed while
the guns of the light battery of the Third
Artillery, stationed near the soldiers and
sailors' monument, boomed forth the na
tional salute of twenty-one kuhs.
The literary exercises were solemn and
Impressive, an occasional touch of hu
mor in the remarks of the speakers serv
ing to recall the minds of their hearers
from thoughts of melancholy and relieve
the proceedings from an aspect too fun
ereal. In the absence of General Warfield,
George R. Smedberg acted as president
of the day. The exercises opened with a
musical selection by the Fourth Cavalry
Band, after which the president made a
brief address of welcome and then intro
duced Rev. Dr. George C. Adams, who
offered prayer.
Post Commander Edward A. Bullis
then delivered a short address, in which
he paid a glowing tribute to the dead he
roes, whose memory, he said, the Ameri
can people loved to cherish and honor.
"The Nation's Dead," set to music by-
Frank G. Rohner, was effectively ren
dered by the Plymouth Quartet, and then
Lincoln's famous Gettysburg address was
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
recited by John H. Roberts, adjutant of
Thomas Post. Comrade Roberts was in
fine voice, and the utterances of the mar
tyred President on that memorable oc
casion fell from his lips with thrilling
emphasis and effect.
An anthem by the Cavalry Band fol
lowed, and then Nellie Holbrook Blinn re
cited "Beyond the Verge of Time," which
elicited enthusiastic applause from, the
assembled veterans.
President Smedberg then introduced
Charles A. Sumner, past commander of
George H. Thomas Post, as the orator of
the day. Mr. Sumner's address was pa
thetic and humorous by turns and an elo
quent tribute to the memory of the de
parted comrades whom they had assem
bled to honor.
"Ladies and gentlemen, comrades and
friends," began Mr Stunner, "this num
ber on the programme has been an
nounced as an oration. Now, there arc
very few orators in the world. I am not
one of them. But almost every full
grown Yankee is a talker. I'm one of
them.
"When George H. Thomas Post assem
hled to-day and marched out to pay a
meed of praise to our departed comrades
we were met at the entrance to the Pre
sidio reservation by a guard of honor
composed of black men of the Twenty
fourth regular infantry, and I could not
help thinking how appropriate it was that
the representatives of the race for whoso
liberty the great war was fought should
be present to aid in the ceremonies in
honor of those who shed their blood fop
them. Sixty-seven members of George H.
Thomas Post have passed away slnea
the post was organized; fifty of them Ha
beneath our f eet; we stand over tha
ashes of our dead to tell of their deeda
and pray for the salvation of their souls.
"1 know it is often said we did not go>
to war to fight for freedom. I deny it.
What were the words that fell from Lin
coln's lips at his first inauguration? I
was present and heard him. He said,
speaking of the people of the South: 'Tho
issue is with you; you have made tha
issue.' That issue was the slavery of the
black man. The people of the South, in
several organizations, had resolved to set
up housekeeping for themselves. They
saw that the onward march of civilization
was threatening to sweep away an insti
tution that they called by a more eupho
nious name but what we called chattel
slavery. Our revolutionary fathers ab
hored slavery so much that they refused,
to place the word in our constitution.
Jeff Davis, Mason and others â and I
speak of them with the most profound
and sincere respect, although I am glad
there is still one hour of one day in the
year when we can refrain from bowing
down in obsequious courtesies â they stood
for slavery, and Mason said slavery was
the cornerstone of the new republic. We
went down to Bull Run and said that
with God's help it should not be, and it
was not. But the battle for mankind is
not yet over. Not yet "O, Freedom, may
thou unlace thy corslet or close thy eya
in slumber."
The speaker then devoted a few re
marks in glowing eulogy of George H.
Thomas Post, which he declared was the
finest in the country* carrying on its
rolls the names of many whose glorious
deeda are a part of the history of the
nation.
"There is Irwin McDowell," he con
tinued. "Have you forgotten that first
commanding general of our army? He
was not to blame for the misfortune â a3
some are pleased to call it â of Bull Run.
That battle was well planned and ably;
conducted and lost through an unfortu
nate mistake in orders or by treachery.
The ashes of that brave and brilliant
man. that grand soldier and polished
gentleman, lie buried beneath a shaft in
this ground, in this national cemetery,
which is ours by the grace of Uncle
Sam."
In concluding 1 his remarks Mr. Sumner
made particular reference to the war in
the Philippines, and paid a neat compli
ment to General James F. Smith of, Cal
ifornia.
"We are all in favor of the present
war," he declared, "as we were of tiw
last and as we will be of the next. There
is one now serving in the Philippines
who is deserving of our best love and
esteem. I mean General James F. Smith
of the California Volunteers. I know
General Smith well. I practiced law with
him at the bar in this city. He is one
of those miracles of God's providence, an
honest lawyer and soldier. If it Was pos
sible to change the George H. Thomas
Post charter we would take him into our
ranks. There has been a great deal of
talk of heroes, and we are all heroes, but
there is a difference between bravery and
courage. A cornered rat will fight. A
man never knows what he is until just at
the supreme test of actual experience.
These whom we are assembled here to
day to honor were put to the test, and all
the world knows how nobly they ac
quitted themselves."
The Plymouth quartet sang "Decora
tion Day," taps were sounded by the
bugler of the Fourth United States Cav
alry, and the assemblage dispersed as
the" ipspiring strains of "The Star-span
gled Banner," by the cavalry band, re
sounded over the reservation.

THE BIRTHDAY OF NATIONAL UNITY.
May 30, 1899.
UPON this anniversary, dearest and saddest to the hearts of all true Ameri
cans, I, in common with those who for four years helped to sustain one of the
most historic conflicts that history has ever recorded, feel that the chasm which
?o long separated a people of a united country has been bridged, and that this
Memorial day marks the beginning of the era of national unity, love and broth
erhood. To-day will be memorable always as the beginning oi a solemn, beau
tiful and touching feature in a mutual homage paid to our heroic dead, for to
lay the blue and the gray are one in a common sentiment. To-day the hearts
md hands of a united people do honor to those whose differences are buried
77 the oblivion of mutual respect, love and honor. Respect and veneration have
?ver characterized our observance of the rites of our soldier dead, and like the
jreat people that we are, the more we enter into the spirit of appreciation of
that which is worthy of all praise in the dead soldiers and sailors, without re
yard as to the cause which they espoused and for which they died, the closer are
we drawn into a common faith and a fuller enjoyment of the united brother
hood which is ours. To-day, marking as it does the complete burial of the
oast, is also the birthday of our national unity.

the memory of their departed comrades.
No fairer spot could have been chosen
for the last sleep of those who had so
well earned a rest. It is on the slope
that ends with the cross <>n Lone Moun
tain and begins with the sands of the
beach. In the center of the plat rises
the single shaft fashioned to resemble
a cannon and dedicated to the hero
dead, and around this are the gray
stones that mark where the veterans
lie.
Among the monuments the speakers'
stand was erected, and the veterans
and their friends grouped themselves
between that and the tall stune cannon.
This had been hung with wreaths and
gainst it the veterans had
leaned their weatherbeaten old Hag.
Behind it was the flagstaff, with the
flag, half hoisted, swinging lazily in
the wind.
Below the plat and almost at the foot
of the hill were stationed two guns from
the Naval .Militia's battery, and every
minute until taps had been sounded
their sharp report broke in on the
speakers words â v voice of war while
â¢ was preaching peace.
Charles IMelman, president of the
day, opened the programme with some
remarks upon the nature of the eel< -
brat ion. He referred to the occasion as
being one f "f special significance; not a
day to mourn for the dead, but one to
do honor to their memory. The glory
they had achieved in the struggle tor
principle and liberty, he said, was far
greater than any fame they could have
wi.-n in the ordinary course of life. They
had done their duty well and unconv
plainingly, he said, and a nation's grati
sras their only recompense.
Rev. Charles Edward Locke delivered
the invocation. It was an eloquent plea
for the peaceful rest of the men who
riven all for their country. He re
ferred to the principiep upon which tin
war of the rebellion had been fought,
â ,c tremendous changes which it
had wrought in history and of the
peace and prosperity which had fol
lowed in its wake. That such a con
flict could havf torn the country and
then that it could have settled into al
m<ipt absolute peace and prosperity im
mediately afterward, said the speaker.
was due to the character i-f the men
who fought and the patriotism which
actuated them. They fought not for
revenge nor for personal ambition; they
fÂ« "tight not in bitterness nor in anger:
they fought for a principle, and having
established that principle they returned
to their homes and took up their neg
lected occupations just where they had
laid them down. The courage of the
soldiers of the American armies was
bred from the pilgrims, and it had been
handed down through all the wars for
freedom and for unity until It had be
come a part <>f the American man.
The immortal words of Lincoln on the
field at Gettysburg were recited by C
Is*. Harris and then the Burnett School
Choral Band sang an ode to the "Na
tion's Dead."
The memorial poem by W. W. Stone,
poet of the day, was then read. Its
closing stanzas are:
Thy wrath, O God, tornadoes call.
And in the blast is death;
For sinful man mur.t prostrate fall
Before thine angry breath.
Eternal God. remove our fears;
Be stilled the whirlwind's rack:
Let love descend these floral stairs,
To bear our tribute back.
Thy ancient temple ruined lies,
1 Let us thy temples be:
And in our hearts let altars rise
For sacrifice to thce.
Thy people sinned and freely bled.
Oh grant we shall not rind
That comrades' blood was vainly shed
For freedom and mankind!
; James G. Maguire, the orator of the ;
day, was then introduced. His whs a
splendid effort. For over half an hour
hie held the attention of his audience, |
and the wind carrying his voice up the
hillside, lost not a word. He spoke of
the sacredness of the day and of its |
deep significance to the younger gener
ation, for, he said, it is into their hands
the celebration of the day must pass j
when the men of '61 have joined their
comrades. He spoke, too, of the volun- j
teer soldier: of the unique conditions of :
his education and the inheritance of
courage which has come down to him
through generations. "The American
soldier is an American citizen even in |
the ranks." he said, "and he can never
be reduced to the level of a mere fight
ing machine, which is the type of the
European soldier." He paid, too, a
graceful tribute to the wives and moth
ers left at home while the volunteers
seek fame upon the battlefield. In Dart
he said:
We come not to mourn the heroes de- |
parted, but to honor their memories, and |
to renew our pledges and sentiments of
fealty to the cause and to the principles
â â  for which they died. 'We mourn them.
j not because we realize that length of
. years could not have increased the glory
iof their lives, nor could equal service
' have been rendered to mankind with
less sacrifice. They fought the bloodiest
war in the history of the world, contend
ing upon every field with men of equal
courage, equal skill and equal fortitude,
and against men who were animated by
I the same high sense of duty by which
they themselves were inspired.
That chapter in our nation's history is
] closed, and in fraternal spirit t"he sons ;
and daughters of the Confederate Vet
erans, with sincere devotion to Union and
Liberty, come "lovingly laden with flow
ers" to join in the national ceremony of
this day. To the whole people the soldiers
of the Union are heroes deserving univer
sal honor, and, as we glorify their mem
ories, we feel no . trace or thought of
gloating over those who fell in the cause
Of disunion, for "they banish our anger
forever when they laurel the graves of
our dead."
The volunteer armies of the Civil War
shed a new luster upon the name of "sol
dier," and a new glory upon our coun
: try, which must ever be a source of pride
' to all the future generations of our peo
ple. They were soldiers in spirit and in
discipline, comparing favorably in these !
I respects with the trained soldiers of the â 
j regular armies of Europe. But they were t
something more than soldiers, and of
some of these higher traits and qualities i
' I think it fitting to speak in commemor
; ating their services and their sacrifices.
Like their ancestors and prototypes of \
the revolution and of â¢ the intervening '
wars, they were .men, inspired by the sen- '
| timents of individual duty and Individual â¢
responsibility!
Even as a soldier in the ranks he was j
an American freeman filled with the In- I
spiration of sentiment and with the self- '
I confidence which is born of . that noble i
| station.
One of the most striking incidents in \
the whole course of the Civil War, to my
mind, was the unwritten agreement based ,
upon a common love of dbuntry. and of
the character and services of Washing
ton, that Mount Vernon farm, the home \
of Washington, should be neutral ground,
to which the soldiers of both armies
might freely go without, fear of molesta
tion and pay respectful homage at Wash
ington's tamb. ,
But that was not the only startling and
unusual evidence of our higher civiliza- i
tion. At the close of each fierce battle j
the passions of the contending 'soldiers j
cooled immediately, and sympathy _ for

the wounded and the suffering prompted
acts of tenderness and kindness to ene
mies such as were nn>st rare In previous
wars, and for the first time in the his
tory of the world a .exeat rebellion in
volving millions of lives and billions of
treasure, closed without one drop of
blood being shed in vengeance by thp
conqueror, giving to mankind the' high
est examiil,- of civilized warfare in all thi
annals of war.
The Spanish- American war. in which
and throughout which the sons and
daughters of Federal and Confederate .sol
diers and the entire citizenship of our
country, without regard to sectional or
other divisions, brought undying glory to
our country and our flag, has demon
strated beyond the possibility of question
that we are a reunited people, in senti
ment and in spirit, with no trace remain
ing of either the cause or the bitterness
of the Civil War. To-day we delight in
recognizing the ex-Confederate cavalry
leader. General Joe Wheeler, as a hero of
our common country just as truly as we
recognize the national character of the
fame of Admiral George Dewey, who In
the Civil War served as a lieutenant un
der the Immortal FarraL-ut.
Henceforth there shall be no division of
our country on sectional lines. Let us
honor those who saved the Union, with
out unduly disparaging those who si
t" destroy it. but who are now its loyal
defenders.
The strewing of the flowers followed
the orator's address, and when the
graves had been transformed into
hanks of blossoms a firing squad from
Lincoln Post stepped forward and gave
;hÂ«- three volleys that speed the sou!
of every true soldier. Then the song
"America" was sung by the people, a
1- nediction was said and the mournful
notes of "taps" ended the ceremonies.

TO HER HEROES

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway. May 30.
The observance of Memorial day in this
city was more general than for many
years past and the parade was composed
of all the Grand Army of the Republic
and allied organizations, including the
Red Cross.
Grand Marshal L. S. Bixby had every
thing ready for a start from the Exposi
tion building on time, and Chief Fletcher,
Captain Wilson, Sergeant Peterson and
a squad of sixteen officers headed the pro
cession. Marshal Bixby was accompanied
by his chief of staff, H. H. Kirby. and
Aids Colonel C. L. Pierce, Major E. W.
Woodward, N. S. Douglas and W. J
Cahill.
Major Hayes attended with Companies
A and F of the Fifth Regiment, in com
mand of Captains Poulter and Wenk.
After the young soldiers came the vet
erans, with the Veteran' Reserves first in
line. The following Grand Army of the
Republic posts were represented: Lyon
Post, Henry L. Longfellow acting com
mander; Appomattox Post, Peter Clarke
post commander; Admiral Porter Post, S.
P. Babcock post commander; Lookout
Mountain Post, A. M. Hamlin post com
mander.
Hon. J. R. Scupham was president of
the day and Professor T. O. Crawford
read the Gettysburg address of President
Lincoln.
Rev. Alexander Blackburn of Portland,
Or., orator of the day, spoke in part as
follows:
We stop an hour in our mad rush for wealth
and power and ask what mean these flowers
on graves? Why cut these stems or disturb
these roots this day more than other days; for
these graves more than for other graves? To
make some answer to this question we set
â¢ur thought. It Is not enough to say that these
craves hold the dust of soldiers. The world
has always been full of soldiers. They bore
the war clubs In the earliest barbaric times.
J They carried the bows and sped the arrows j
j when tribe met tribe. They thrust the spe&t |
I and hurled the javelin in Europe and they |
i marched in solid -columns under Xerxes. Sol- i (
diers' graves may "be found in every land, j !
[ whether they fell before Joshua's sword or

were almost fearless, and the troops of Ens- ,
land who sought to hold America for George '.
11l were not cowards. Nor yet do we honor ,
these graves bcoause these brave soldiers were ;
honest. They believed they were right, but so ' ;
did the brave men of the rank and file who â  J
wore the Cray.
Falsely educated and falsely led we may see i ;
in the thousands who carried the muskets of ; (
the South men whose impulses were true and i
whose motives were patriotic.
Not so of their leaders; they were willfully , â 
and wickedly and traitorously wrong. Their 'â 
rebellion was not a blunder, but a crime, and \ â 
all ages will hold them responsible. If they : (
die unrepentant, let them die' unwept, and
never let the flag be lowered to half-mast for . ,
an unrepentant traitor.
No, comrades and fellow citizens. The men
whose graves are strewn with flowers were not | j
only soldiers, brave and honest, but they were \ }
more than these worrts describe. Another word
muÃt be added. They were, as Judged by all ; ,
laws, human and divine, right. Their cause ;
Was a right cause. The flag under which they j
fought and fell represented sentiments that ,
were Just and true. They stood for unity and
not division.
These graves mark the campaign of an army
Of progress. Glorious were their achieve- ; i
ments, grand their victories. Vet there is more ; '
to be done.
The richest possessions of the earth are the
graves where the once living are buried. ThÂ« sf
heroes lie moldering. the soul of their work ;
lives on. These graves of the dead and the I
wounds of the living call for a hlfflvr intelli- |
gence of the citizen, progress in the recognition
of human right, a higher appreciation of j
American citizenship.
Thousands feathered ;ii the cemetery to ! â 
witness the decorating of the soldiers'
graves and to see the salutea fired over
J each grave. -Hundreds of school children

SUICIDE ON THE
TRANSPORT SHERIDAN
CLERK ROBERT CREIGHTON
KILLS HIMSELF.
It Is Said That He Had Been Sick
and Despondent for Sev
eral Weeks.
Robert Crelghton, quartermaster's
clerk on the United States transport '
Sheridan, now lying oft' Folsom-stroet
wharf, was found dead in his bed at 5
O'clock yesterday afternoon. A bullet hole i
in his right temple and a revolver at his j
side told th<- story.
The officers on the vessel did their ut
most to keep the facts from becoming j
public. The facts of the case were
learned along the front and the Coroner
was telephoned to for further particu
lars.' At the Coroner's office nothing was
known of the case and the wagon was at
nnrv sent out. At Folsom-street whan
Deputies Gately and Flanagan were met
by Captain Uaeholder, who told them ho
knew nothing of the cas- beyond the
fact that the man was dead and that
Coroner Hill had been communicated
with, ;ml had given the resident quartern
master permission to have the body taken
to :ui undertaking parlors. When Coroner
Hill was interrogated over the telephone
)!â¢â  expressed considerable surprise, as he
had heard nothing of the cast-. He gave
the required permission, however, and
the wagon went back without the body.
A rumor was circulated to the effect
that the head bore wounds as if by a
blunt instrument, giving color to the the
ory of foul play: but the presence of
any such wounds was emphatically denied
by the undertakers.
Captain Bachelder, who has charge of
the vessel while she is- at sea, refused
positively to giv any information regard
ing Creighton, He said he could not even
guess at what his age was. although
Creighton had served under him for sev
eral months. He admitted that lie was
an elderly man. but would not say within
twenty years of what his age might be.
Others of the Sheridan's crew were just
nb"ut as wise. After close questioning
they admitted that Creighton "was a
pretty old man, who joined the vessel last
February in New York, and had been
sick and in low spirits for some time
past." rt wa.<= also learned that he had
bei n in the Government employ a number
of years and had a son IS years old.

KNOCKED UNCONSCIOUS
BY A BRUTAL MOTORMAN
C. DAVIS HURT WHILE IN A
HELPLESS STATE.
Charles Davis, who resides at 623 Ten
nessee street, was struck on the head by
a motorman on the Folsom-street electric
line yesterday and did not regain con
sciousness until he arrived at the Re
ceiving Hospital. The injured man was
intoxicated and boarded the car in com
pany with Charles Hansen of 504 Twen
tieth street. Seeing Davis' condition the
conductor refused to allow him to ride
unless his friend went along to care for
him. During the discussion the motor
man showed his impatience by ordering
Hansen. off, but his fellow servant was
more lenient.
Davis showed a desire to enter the in
terior of the car. but his way was blocked
by the conductor, and during the dis
pute the motorman rushed in and struck
the inebriated man over the head with
the heavy handle used in controlling the
car. .
Despite the cries of "Shame!" from the
passengers the railroad employe struck
the helpless man again on the head, fell
ing him to the floor of the car. The un
conscious man. was then hauled out on
the street and carried to a nearby drug
store, while the car continued on its jour
ney.
As Davis did not regain his senses Offi
cer R. M. McDowell sent him to the hos
pital for treatment. It. was feared he had
sustained a fractured skull, but on close
examination two ugly scalp wounds were
found to be his only injuries.
E. C. Garbutt of 737 Howard street vis
ited police headquarters last evening and
stated he saw the motorman strike Da
vis. Up to a late hour the motorman who
committed the assault had not been taken
into custody.

William Purdy, who resides at 2042 How

cious horse at the Five Mile House yes

clip on trie horse, whon the brute roarer
and made a sudden plunge forward wit]
open mouth ami seized his hand. Purdy'!
cries for help attracted the ;uu-ntion o:
some men who were about the yard a
the time. They came to his aid and witl
a broom handle beat thr- animal oft. Th.
injured man was conveyed to the Citj
and County* Hospital, where Dr. Tillmai
dressed the lacerated wounds. Fortunate
ly no bones were injured.

an address by Governor Roosevelt and a
salute of twenty-one guns fired from the
United States cruiser Brooklyn, which lay
in the Hudson just below the hill with
all her battle-flags flying.
More than 10,000 persons witnessed the
! ceremonies and crowded Claremont in the
i vicinity of the tomb. A large stand had
been erected on the east side of the tomb,
covered with red, white and blue bunt
ing. Here the ceremony was conducted.
General A. W. Clous of Governors Island
and Colonel H. D. Woodruff, acting com
missary general of the regular army, rep
resented the army.
Governor Roosevelt received an ovation
when he arose to speak. He delivered a
eulogy on General Grant. Of him he said:
Mercy and peace go hand In hand. It General
Grant had shown mercy at Fort Donelson It
would have meant years of destruction and
Jesolatii,n, and If he had not shown mercy at
ApDomattox a breach of peace would have
widened between us and our brethren which
never could have closed.
Continuing, Governor Roosevelt said:
Here I stand In this beautiful spring weather
In our own beloved country and State, with
quiet peace prevailing, while In the tropical,
withering heat of the Philippines. . lighting for
the glorious flag with the same motive you
Grand Army men fought with In IM>4, are your
sons and their hero comrades. - .
Those men have a right to demand that you
think of them not with maudlin sympathy or
reeret. but as soldiers and men. Small, in
deed, be my respect for an American, unless
bound by ties of family and dependence, if he
did not welcome the chance to serve under
Otis and Mac Arthur and follow gallant Funs
ton as they follow the flag that you and their
fathers followed to victory In the civil war.
Let us make our voices felt in the Philippines,
that we stand behind the men who are doing
all they can to honor the flag as you did, and
remember, when victory comes, as it will, that
a heavier task by far is on usâ the task of
peace. When order is restored in the Philip
pines we must make peace and keep order
there and bring prosperity with this order.
We must learn by lessons of which we are
not proud, no less than those of which we are
proud. Don't be afraid to face facts as they
are. whether they are or are not pleasant. I
learned a few days ago that there is an
Alaskan town which does not care to consider
itself of the United States, but wants to be
declared a part of Canada, but the United
States would not take the trouble to provide
for its proper government. Every good Ameri
can should bow his head in shame that such
a request should be made because of the neg
lect of the United States Government. Lei
(â¢very man do all In his power and with all his
force to see that every colony over which the
flog waves, as well as at home, be governed
so that the people of those colonies will he
lieve It to be a great thing to have the chance
to live under that flag.
One of the most remarkable features of
the day was the extraordinary reception
corded the Seventy-first -Regiment In
the New York military parade. Several
officers of this organization have been
subjected to inquiry regarding their con
duct in Cuba, but the men were greeted
to-day with enthusiasm that has seldom
been seen in New York. All along Fifth
â  avenue the crowd yelled and cheered
- when the Seventy-first passed as they did
; for no other regiment. Women tore off
sashes, ribbons and even caps and waved
them in the air.
As the Seventh Regiment of the Na
tional Guard, which did not go to war,
passed the reviewing stand of the Man
hattan parade several persons began to
hiss. The hissing grew in volume until
it was almost drowned by the cheers with
which the friends of the regiment tried
to tide this unfriendly demonstration.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
PARIS, May 30.â A large throng gath
ered this afternoon in the Cemetery of
Picpus to assist in the annual decoration
by the Americans of the tomb of La
fayette. The interest in the occasion was
enhanced by the knowledge that ex-
President Benjamin Harrison would
speak.
General Porter, the United States Em
bassador, opened the ceremony with a
brief address, and Mr. Harrison fallowed
with an oration that was frequently ap
plauded. He spoke of the deep respect
shown to Decoration day- in the United
States and the revertnt care taken of
graves of American soldiers, remarking
that the chief value of such observances
was in impressing the hearts and minds
of the people with the lessons of self-sac
rifice and heroism.
"The nation that cherishes the graves'
of its soldiers and assembles to honor
them," he said, "is the nation that pre
serves and enlarges national life. The
monuments to our dead show no trailing
ranks of sad or weary captives following
their conquerors, but display broken
manacles from the hands and feet of
emancipated blacks. The result of that
emancipation was seen at Santiago, where
the black troops and the Texas troops
vied with each other to be the first to
leap upon the enemy's breastworks."
Mr. Harrison- then referred to the "gal
lant and glorious son of Vermont now
returning homeward after achievements
that wllT keep his name ever illustrious
in the annals of all nations.
"Heir in the capita! of our great sister
republic," he continued, "where no sol
dier of American birth finds a resting
place, we see sentiment of gratitude and
veneration finding suitable expression
around the tomb of Lafayette, the crusad
er of liberty who came to our aid in a
time of stress; his name is perhaps more
closely than any other connected with the
name of Washington. Let the President
of France and all Frenchmen be assured
of the sentiment of amity and gratitude
by all Americans. All things that minis
ters to stable government, national
wealth and social content in France will
give us gratification."
Comte de Chamhrun followed with a
brief address of thanks on behalf of the
Lafayette family.

MANILA. May 30.â Memorial day wag
celebrated at Battery Knoll, where Scott's
guns were planted against the Filipino

bleak mound, surrounded by rieefields,

when, just before sunset, a few hundred

FRANCE STIRRED TO ITS DEPTHS
DREYFU'S IS
CERTAIN TO
BE SET FREE
There is No Other Result
Possible After Revision
Is Granted.
Special Cable to The Call and the New York
HeraM. Copyrighted. 1599, by ,lun:<-s (i.r
don Bennett.
PARIS, May 30.â Even the most
rabid of tho anti-Dreyfusites
realize that their hideous game
ia up. Would you have proof?
They say nothing, or as little as
tt)le, about the case. Yesterday's
papers, those which have been the
cruelesl , nemies of Dreyfus, found no
material for leading articles on the ju
dicial proceedings that seem likely to
end the greatest crime of civilization.
The Petit Journal discussed the cen.
tenarj of th. Comedie Francaise and
did not refer in a Bingle line to the re
vision of the Dreyfua case in its en
tire lour pages. Eclaire talked about
the opera comique. The Journal, Gau
lois, Libc< Parole and Echo de Paris
said nothing.
Revision means acquittal in the
minds of threg-fi.-urths of the French
â  t"-day. The other fourth dread
it. lest public attention be turn..! to
their misdoings. Sieele summed up this
sentiment in one lint- yesterday. Its
cartoon by Ibels represented "Law
Bearing the Ax of Justice." on one
Bide there is a group of generals, cow
ering on their knees behind some
bushes, and the horribly significant le
gend was '"Let us hope she will not see
us."
It is most probable that justice will
be blind in the present case. The prom
inent actors in this ghastly crime have
been castigated by the discredit they
have brought upon themselves. Ester
hazy is in flight, Henry is dead. Every
body now knows that the army was no
more incriminated In the actions of a
als than was the nation, for
rmy Is the nation. When these
few Individuals have been repudiated
the sponge will, in all probability, be
passed over the slate.
As for Deroulede, as I cabled you the
day aft< r the late President Faun 's
ral, i) body takes his escapade se
riously. The chances seem to favor his
acquittal. All Paris is laughing over
his speech yesterday. He seems to
think thrtt because Victor Hiiro was
a great poet and a poor politician he
must be a great politician because he
is a poor poet. But the public refuses
:o accept him as anything but an amus
ing rhapsodlst, Mho should be dealt
with indulgently. This sentiment will
probably dictate the jury's verdict, par
ticularly as Deroulede has been in
prison three months while awaiting
trial.

MAJOR MARCHAND.
Court of Cassation resumed its sitting: for
the hearing of arguments In the Dreyfus
case and for the examination of M. De
roulede and Marcel Habert. The same
precautions were observed as on yester
day for the preservation of order. The
arrival of the Judges and others con
nected with two celebrated cases was
marked by no unusual incident. The in
terior of the Court of Cassation presented
to-day the same aspect as on yesterday.
Behind President Mazoay there were
seated many Judges and other court of
ficers, public men and distinguished men
of letters. The same impressive silence
was observed when the sitting opened at
noon.
M. Ballot de Beaupre resumed the read-
Ing of his report on the Dreyfus case.
He said that if in 1594 the officers of the
court-martial had thought it was their
duty to show Dreyfus the documents con
cerning him. the Judges not being law
yers, had erred, though acting in good
faith, He then entered at. length Into a
consideration of the arguments of the
anti-revisionists, who, he said, contend
that even if the document "Cc Cainalle de
d " should be shown not to refer to
Dreyfus it would be no reason for revi
sion, because the document was not re
sponsible for the conviction of Dreyfus.
The machinations of Colonel Dv Paty
de Clam and Lieutenant Colonel Henry,
it had also been argued, gave no ground
for revision, because they bad also been
disavowed by General Gonze. assistant
chief of the general staff, and by his su
perior. General Boisedeffre. M. de Beau
pre created a deep sensation by solemn
ly declaring that he had become con
vinced that the bordereau was written by
Major Count Ferdinand Waslln Ester
hazy. He read a fresh report drawn up
by M. Maneau, the procurator general.
on Saturday last, in view of the recent
developments. enumerating ten fresh
facts in favor of Dreyfus, viz. :
Iâ The Henry forgery.
2â The changing of the date of the bor
dereau to August Instead of April.
3â Contradlctlons*of the handwriting expert*.
4â The absolute identity of the paper upon
prowling about and called out. "Who is
there?" but received no reply. Kitzmeyer
then went into his own house and aroused
his son. George, who spread the alarm l.y
firinK a numl>rr of shots from ;: revolver.
Kitzmeyer again went to the dividing
fence and saw the person who had Btarted
the blaze disappear in the rear door of
the Lynd building. Although he could
n.it distinguish the features of the man
his suspicions were aroused, and he con
cluded Lynd was the man who did th"
work. Sheriff Kinny sunn heard of the
suspicion directed against Lypd. Search
for Dynd was Instituted. He was found
in the building, where ho was removing
his belongings, anil was Immediately
placed under arrest.
Lynd protested his innocence, and
claimed to have been in bod since 9
o'clock. His daughter, Ilattie, corrob
orates him in this statement.
As soon as it became generally known
that he had been placid under arrest a
crowd gathered about the jail, and the
j Sheriff and his deputies put in a few min
i utes of extreme anxiety. Warden Hen
derson of the State Prison appeared at
] the jail, and after a hasty consultation
it was concluded to remove Lynd to the
, State institution. He was speedily hus
tled into the Sheriff's rig and taken to
the penitentiary, from which he was re
leased to-day on %\i**\ bonds. There is
strong circumstantial evidence against
him.
The loss from the fire was about $5000.

which the bordereau was written with Ma-
Jor Kst.Th.izy's letter paper.
sâThe5 â The sentence "Am starting for the ma
neuvers," which could not have been written
by Drejfcus.
6â The police report withheld by the court
martial.
Tâ Lieutenant Colonel Henry's weeping con
fesslon in Burtulu'a office.
Sâ The Fanizzardi dispatch.
9â Official documents proving that Dreyfus
had no relations with foreign embassies.
10â A document demonstrating that Dreyfus
never confessed guilt.
M. Ballot de Heaupre amplified his In
dictment of Major Esterhazy. saying that
one new fact, from a legal point of view,
was the discovery thai the bordereau was
written upon precisely the same paper as
that used by Major Esterhazy. The
judges in 1894 dirt not know this, and M.
de Beaupre declared that on his soul and
conscience, according to his conviction,
the bordereau was written by Esterhazy.
He deplored the attacks of the revision
ists upon the army, but said that thÂ«
honor of the army was not dependent up
on the retention of an innocent, man on
Devils Island.
M. de Beaupre concluded: "I do not
ask you to proclaim the innocenoe of
Dreyfus, but it is with a firm conviction
and a high sense of my duty and respon
sibility that I say there is reason to
grant a revision of the trial of 1594 and
for sending Dreyfus for retrial before an
other court-martial, whose task will be
to give a decision with a full knowledge
of the facts."
Amidst great excitement M. Maneau.
the Procurator-General, began his ad
dress to the court. He claimed that the
change in the date of the bordereau con
stituted a ii' -w fact apart from numerous
other new facts, and declared that the
bordereau was really the work of Major
Esterhazy. M. Maneau dwelt upon the
strangeness of the general staff's protec
tion of Esterhazy and the latter s am
bteulty.
The eouri adjourned at 5 o'clock with
out incident. M. Maneau will continue
his speech to-morrow.
CORNELL'S BOAT
CREW IN FRONT
Beats Pennsylvania in a
Hard Race.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
ITHACA, N. V., May 30.â The Cor
nell-Pennsylvania boat race was
I rowed at 7:30 o'clock this evening. The
I lake, which had been exceptionally
I rough all day, quieted down by C
{ o'clock, so that Referee Mum ford was
able to call the Cascadilla-Cornell
race, which was scheduled to take
: place after the Cornell-Pennsylvania
race. This contest was started at 6:55,
and Cornell won from Cascadilla.
Cornell and Pennsylvania were ready
for the contest immediately after the
first race had been rowed. The obser
j vation train returned to the start, and
Cornell reached there at 7:15. Penn
sylvania joining at 7:20.
Pennsylvania chose the inside
course. At the word the Pennsylva
nians had a slight advantage in catch
ing the water first and gained nearly a
third of a length after a dozen strokes.
Cornell did not attempt to spurt, but
rowed a 32 stroke. Pennsylvania had
started with 34, and from time to time
increased it to 36. Cornell began to
gain at the quarter mile, and at the
mile had more than made up the loss
at the beginning.
Pennsylvania had lost about a half
length at the mile and a quarter and
began to put effort into their work.
Cornell's rowing did not vary, and al
though Pennsylvania pushed the nose
of her shell nearly even with the Itha
cans at the mile and a half Cornell did
not let out until abo-ut 300 yards of the
finish. The men in the Cornell boat
then rowed a thirty-three stroke, while
Pennsylvania went up to thirty-seven.
The Ithaoans gained slightly and at the
end won by fully a half-length in
11:26%. Pennsylvania's time was 11:28.
Both crews finished strong and pulled
to the boathouse in good form. Coach
Courtney and Coach Ward expressed
their satisfaction at the showing made
by their respective crews. Coach Ward
said the better crew had won and he
thought his men rowed a magnificent
race. About SOOO people saw the race.
GOLDEN CROSS MINE
LITIGATION ENDED
LOS ANGELES, May 30.â The long
drawn-out and costly litigation over the
Golden Cross mine at Hedges, in San
Diego County, is at an end. A compro
mise has been offered and accepted and
only the detaJls of the deal now remain
to be fixed. For several days D. M Del
mas and Samuel M. Shortridge of Sun
Francisco have been in the city conferring
with the various persons interested in tht
litigation. They represent Colonel Isaac
Trumbo, who will have possession of the
property within a short time.
The settlement, in brief, as it has been
already agreed upon, is that the Free
Gold Mining Company, the stock of which
is owned chiefly by Colonel Trumbo, shall
pay to the original owners of the property
the sum of $1,uu0,000 and assume all the
outstanding indebtedness and thereafter
own and control the mine. C. N. Pauly
of San Diego, the present receiver of the
property, appointed to operate the mine
while the litigation was pending, may be
retained as manager, though this has not
been definitely decided.
This is the largest mining property in
Southern California and under the man
agement of Receiver Pauly has been
made to pay a handsome profit.
THE HERO
OF FASHODA
AT TOULON
Major Marchand Is the Pres
ent Idol of the French
People.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
TOULON. May 30.â Major Maryl
and arrived here at 12:30 o'clock
this afternoon on board the
French cruiser D'Assis. The hero
of Fashoda was greeted with im
mense enthusiasm, the ship having him
on board being escorted into the har
bor by a large number of steamers. At
the landing Major Marohand was re
ceived by the Mayor of Toulon and
several generals of the French army,
who welcomed him in speeches of laud
ation.
The roadstead was crowded with ves
sels decked out with flags, and all man
ner of steamboats were out to welcome
the explorer on his return to France.
When the cruiser D'Assis entered the
port flags and handkerchiefs were
waved everywhere, and shouts of "'Vive
l'Armee" and "Vive Marchand" re
sounded in all directions.
Replying to the addresses. Major
Marchand expressed his heartfelt
thanks for tho demonstrations of wel
come. He recalled his own anguish and
that of his comrades when they were
ordered to evacuate Fashoda, and
again when on reaching Abyssinia he
heard that his beloved France had risen
against the army.
"But we have found to-day," he con
tinued, "that the latter fear was with
out foundation. We do not take the
honor shown us as meant for ourselves,
but rather for the army, and 1 sum up
all our thoughts by joining you in the
three cries I have heard since my ar
rival: "Vive La France," "Vive l'Ar
mee" and "Vive La Republique."
France is for the moment downcast
through want of union. We must be
united. It is the only way to be strong."
These sentiments were received with
thunders of applause.
PLAGUE MIT
DELAY BEWEY
Admiral to Come Home
Slowly, Anyway.
HONGKONG, May 30.â Since his ar
rival here on May 23, on board his flag
ship, the United States cruiser Olym
pia, Admiral Dewey has improved in
health, though he still refuses all in
vitations of a social nature. The ad
miral has also relinquished all official
duty on board the Olyrnpia. The date
of his departure for home is still un
certain, his intention being to remain
here until he has thoroughly recuper
ated. The air of the high ground here
is much cooler than it will be found at
any place between Hongkong and the
Mediterranean Sea.
The programme for the Olympiads
voyage to the United States has not
been definitely decided upon. It has
been determined, however, to make a
Stop at the Piraeus, from which port
Admiral Dewey will go to Athens to
pay his respects to King George of
Greece. The Olympia is being painted
white instead of the dark slate color
which was applied Â«Xo it before the late
war.
The plague is likely to complicate the
home-coming of the admiral. Various
Governments have already declared se
vere quarantine regulations against all
Egyptian Red Sea ports and Hong
kong, where the fresh cases and the
number of deaths have nearly doubled
in the past week, the new cases num
bering 143 and the deaths 134. Ad
miralty officials say that warships have
not privileges as regards quarantine
beyond those of merchant ships, the
main point to be considered being
whether the ship is infected or there is
sickness aboard. By the time Admiral
Dewey arrives at the Mediterranean,
his ship, the Olympia, having been so
long out from Hongkong, if there are
no cases aboard she will probably be
regarded as immune and the inspectors
will pass her without delay.
DEWEY TALKS OF
HOBSON'S ACHIEVEMENTS
NEW YORK, May 30.â A cable to the
World from Hongkong says: Admiral
Dewey seldom discusses men or events
of the Spanish war, but now and then
he says things full of pith and paint.
He allowed himself to talk of some of
the affairs in the Cuban campaign to
day. Speaking of the splendid Merri
mac affair at Santiago the hero of Ma
nila said of Lieutenant Hobson:
"I like him. He is a brave man, dig
nified and modest. The trouble about
Hobson Is that he takes life too seri
ously and is bashful."
Admiral Dewcy expects to continue
his homeward voyage early next week.
FAVORS ESTABLISHING
A REFRIGERATOR LINE
SACRAMENTO, May 30.â The execu
tive committee chosen by the recent con
vention of fruit growers of California to
perfect such a plan of organization as
should result in promoting: their best in
terests and securing their release from
the present method of fruit transporta
tion and marketing that threatens to in
volve them in disastrous loss, if not finan
cial ruin, has given careful consideration
to the whole suDiect, and has reached
this unanimous conclusion:
First, that the fruit growers organize
for mutual protection.
Second, thaf the fruit growers form a
corporation for the purpose of owning
and operating a refrigerator car line.
Third, that the fruit growers organize
for the purpose of marketing their fruit
and fruit products. In doing this they
will be allowed the utmost liberty in the
disposal of their fruit, either by selling
for spot cash at loading point, through
our own representatives In the large
cities, or agents, or through Messrs. Por
ter or Earl, and any agent whom the
grower or shipper designates.
The executive committee has called
meetings at- Newcastle for Thursday
evening. June 1; Suisun. Saturday. 2
p. m., June 3; Vacaville, Saturday even-
Ing, S o'clock; all the principal fruit sec
tions in the Sacramento and San Joaquin

ARBITRATION IN
PLACE OF WAR
Peace Conference May
Agree.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, May 31.â The correspon.
dent of the Standard at The Hague
says: An important advance was
made to-day in the direction of a
scheme of arbitration, combining the
Russian, British and American pro
posals. The representatives of these
nations arrived at an agreement which
seems to find general acceptance. Sir
Julian Paunoefote conferred this after
noon with Seth Low and Mr. Holls,
and both the British and American
proposals were examined, with the re
sult that the United States will sup
port the Pauncefote scheme for a per
manent tribunal.
In all practical and essential features
the British and American-plans are
identical, but the American delegates
have gone further, covered the whole
field of arbitration and drafted pro
visions for a rehearing in the event of
a disagreement. Their proposals will
be submitted to the drafting committee
to-morrow.
"It ought not to be difficult," said Mr.
Holls, "to hammer out a workable plan
from these three plans."
THE HAGUE. May 30.â The Brussels
conference section of the International
Peace Congress, after adopting the sec
ond reading of articles 23 to 34, which
dealt with prisoners of war, discussed
questions relating to flags of truce,
capitulations and armistices as con
tained in articles 43 to 52, inclusive,
upon which an agreement was reached.
The Red Â« !rofls section considered the
extension of the Geneva convention to
naval warfare and adopted slight modi
fications of the articles relating to con
traband, leaving the other two cate
gories for future consideration.
SANTA FE RAILROAD
TO ENTER SACRAMENTO
SACRAMENTO, May 30.â F. E. Valen
tine, commercial agent of the Santa Fe in
Sacramento, to-day made' the important
announcement that the officials of the
Santa Fe hail definitely decided that the
lirst extension of the Santa Fe lines after
the absorption of the San Joaquin Valley
road on July 1 will be to Stockton, Sac
ramento and north. Mr. Valentine ex
pressed the belief that the people of this j
city would see the Santa Fe running into
Sacramento within eighteen months.
The announcement of Commercial Agent
Valentine corroborates the belief long en
tertained in this section of the State that
the Santa Fe would make Sacramento one
of its important centers. In fact, it has
been known that the company has had
right of way established to this city and
the location of the depot and freight of
fices has been discussed with more or less
well-grounded supposition. It is probable
the road will enter Sacramento on its
eastern edge, the Southern Pacific having
a claim on the western or river border of
the city. For some months past the Santa
Fe has had an office in this city and has
been making a lively competition for
freight business, meeting its full share of
It is believed that the entrance of a
competing line to this city will have the
effect of greatly advancing the commer
cial interests of this city, while the out
lying districts through which the road wii
run will also experience the advantages.
Bishop Closes a Church.
ST. LOUIS, May 30.â Because of the de
termined opposition of the parishioners of
St. Patrick's Human Catholic Church in
East St. Louis to the appointment of
Vicar General Cluse as their rector,
Bishop Jannsen will -lose the church to

Angers Stocktonians.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
STOCKTON, May 30.â The people of
this city were dumfounded this evening
when a local paper came out with an
Associated Press dispatch from New-
Orleans stating that H. J. Corcoran,
manager of the California Navigation
and Improvement Company, had writ
ten to Mayor Fowler of that city with a
view to inducing wholesale immigra
tion of negro labor to this section. The
indignation among laborers on the wa
ter front was not greater than that
among laboring people generally. Even
the business men, who for two years
have struggled to carry unemployed
customers, shared in the widespread
consternation over the following bold

"The letter says in substance that
there is an extreme scarcity of reliable
labor in California and that the outlook
is for a long continuation of this state
of affairs, particularly in the business
in which the writer is engaged. A great
many able-bodied negroes, he says, will
be assured employment if they are good
citizens, and a wide field will be opened
for the surplus negro population of the
South."
Labor is undoubtedly more in demand
in this section than for two years on
account of good crops, but this par
ticular demand at best can last but two
months. The consensus of opinion in
this community is overwhelmingly
against the idea of,bringing this class
of labor in, and all attempts to justify
the letter will fail. Said a prominent
contractor this evening:
"The general situation as to the de
mand for labor has improved material
ly during the past ninety days, but
there are still idle men to be found. The
transferring of New Orleans levee
'roustabouts' to Stockton could have
but one result and that to force down
wages for every class of work in which
they engaged, and in addition to the
eommuity's burden of deserving poor
we would have a lot of improvident, ir
responsible negroes on our hands. I
would rather pay my men good wages,
for when wages are good times are
good."
Mr. Corcoran not infrequently has
trouble with deckhands and others em
ployed by him, and wages have been
brought down to what can hardly be
called the living point. People of this
city understand the situation so thor
oughly that the motive in the plea for
| negro labor is to them easy to discern.
j The idea of bringing large bodies of
i negroes into this section will arouse a
sentiment so strong that some public
action may be taken.

EVERY MAN HAS
A SACK OF GOLD
Alluring Reports From
Sierra Pintada.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN DIEGO, May 30.â The schnnnpp
Santa Barbara arrived at San Quintin,
Lower California, late this afternoon with
the first official and authentic report of
the Sierra Pintada placers, which have
been attracting; the attention of (he coast
for two weeks past. The Santa Barbara
took down thirty tons of supplies for the
camp two weeks ago from San Quintin.
and Francisco Salorio was delegated by
Collector of Customs Vi< toria at En
senada to go down on the schooner and
make an official Investigation of' the
placers.
Mr. Salorio brings back a glowing re
port, which must be taken as accurate so
far as it is possible for a man tv give an
accurate report of a raw camp. He says
that when the arrival of the Santa Barbara
at San Rogue Bay became known in the
diggings Mexicans with from twenty-flve
to sixty ounces of gold each made a rush
for the coast for supplies from the
schooner, paying any price asked for the
necessaries of life. Mtr. Solario visited
live camps In the diggings, in which abo'U
300 people were camped, every one maku
from two pennyweights to one and a nau/
ounces a day, working only until : or J
o'clock. The miners washed in pans by
blowing, as verj few bad dry-washers*
Water is selling at â >- : â >' twenty

Creek, has an abundance of waiei.

of the gulf side is on. Gold has been
found over a district twelve miles long

camps are springing up. Salono met
twelve dry-washers out of one camp,
which is the best known at present, ea- h
showing- him from fifty to sixty ounces
in very coarse gold found at from six
3 to four feet in depth. The sur
rounding mountains are believed 0
rich in quartz, but at present everybody
is paying attention to the search for nug

" From San Rogue Bay to the placers^the
1 distance is twenty-one miles; from Cal
malii to the first camp It is from 95 to
1(X) miles, and from the Santa Rosalia
copper mines on the gulf side it is lro
miles over a very rough and dangerous
road, water and feed for animals I
scarce. Most of the men in the pla
had gone there afoot. The best way to
reach the diggings is by the seacoast to
San Roqui Landing.
Mr. Salorio Bays he met prospectors
without dry washers or pans, who sim
ply used shovels, throwing the dirt into
t!i" air and then picking up the gold.
Others blew the dirt on a blanket or can
vas.
The climate is about the same as at
Ensenada, â¢
It is difficult to find how much gold has 1
been taken out, for the placering has '
been going on for the past three months.
Every one in the diggings had got gold,
however, and claimed to "be doing well.
There is increased excitement in San
Diego over the news, and it is probable
the steamer St. Denis, which will leave
on Thursday night, will take down over
100 men to the diggings, landing them at
Sin Rogue, which is six miles nearer the
camp than Is Ascension. The distance by
sea from San Diego is about 275 miles.

PRESBYTERIAN SYNOD
TO CONVENE AT SEA
Sessions Will Be Held on a Steamship
. During a Trip to Alaska
f and Return.
ITACOMA, May 30.â Pacific North
west Synod of the Presbyterian church,
comprising Washington, Idaho and
Alaska, will hold Its annual session next
August aboard the steamship City of
Seattle during a two weeks' trip to Alas
ka and return. This big steamer, with
accommodations for 500 people, has been
chartered for the Presbyterians' exclusive
use, and for two weeks will be trans
ferred from a treasure boat, bringing out
millions of Klondike gold, to a gospel
steamer, where altars will take the place
of bars.
Delegates from five presbyteries, to
gether with their families, friends and
other prominent Presbyterians, will take
the trip, thereby combining the business
of the synod with pleasure, sermons and
sightseeing. From Tacoma the steamer
will go straight to Sitka, where delegates
and members of the Alaska presbytery
will be taken aboard. Business sessions
of the synod will then be commenced, as
the steamer runs to Juneau, Skaguay and
Glacier Bay. On the return trip stops
Will be made at Sitka, Marys Island,
Wrangel and Metlakahtla. All business
will be transacted before the Alaskan
delegates are put ashore at Sitka and
their several homes, as their presence is
just as Important as is that of the dele
gates from Washington and Idaho.
This will be the most . unique religious
gathering ever held in the Northwest. It
was suggested at last year's session of
the synod at Spokane, when delegates
from interior towns expressed the wish
that this year's meeting could be held in,
Alaska, with the object of encouraging
the growth of Presbyterianism in that
far-off territory. Several business men
among the delegates grasped the idea of
how this could be accomplished and the
preliminary plans for the coming August
meeting were then laid. The delegates"
will pay $3A each for the round trip, and
jk-jll others $40.

Literally by Storm.
Call Headquarters, Wellington Hotel,
Washington, May 30.
Blanche Bates, the California actress,
has captivated Washington and the city

Bates' phenomenal triumphs this sea

had a brief but meteoric career, begun
in California only a few seasons ago,
when Frawley discovered and developed
her talent. Her coming to New York,
where, as a member of Augustin Daly's
et.-mpany. she became the rival of Miss
Kehan for critical commendation and
popular applause, won the most gener
ous praise any new American actress
has ever received from the New York
press.
"All this set a high standard of ex
pectation that few players would be
able to equal, but it may be said with
out exaggeration that no one was dis
appointed and many were surprised
with her performance last night. Wash

neither has surpassed in excellence that
of last night by the Frawley company."
The Times says: "A scant three

that ere long an actress would come
out of the far West to startle the world
with her infinite genius and establish
a new standard of perfect art. The

about 150 armed natives came through the

natives, to whom we had given the food,
opened tire on us with rifles, we re

came all around us. Luckily, however,
there was but one man hit. and he was

"According to our construction of the

"the boundary line should follow the

Inlets, which are territorial waters,

place in American territory the strip of
territory which was given to Russia by
the treaty of 1825. beyond and above all

that this was the position maintained by

CINCINNATI, May 30.â John Bright
won the Decoration Day handicap for
three-year-olds and upward at Latonia
to-day in a driving finish. He beat Isabey
a nose on the post after one of the most
exciting contests ever witnessed at the
Latonia track. May Hempstead, the fa
favorlte, was third. She set her own pace
for the first mile, which was covered fu
1:43^4, and then gave up the position to
John Bright, who was joined by Isabey in
the last 100 yards, and the pair fought it
out to the wire. Isabey was closing fast
as they neared the winning post and
would have won in another stride. Bat
ten was beaten two lengths for third
money. The track was soft from the
light rain which fell before the horses
went to the post for the stake race. The
stake was worth $1870 to the winner. Re

NEW YORK, May 30.â The attendance
at Gravesend to-day was fully as large
as that on Brooklyn handicap day. The
card was a poor one, however. In the
Clover stakes Fond Hopes was a favorite
and early in the race got a lead of a half
dozen lengths. Coming Into the stretch,
however, the favorite dropped back to
third place, while Oneck Queen and Mis
ericordia had it out in a drive all the.
way through, finishing a length apart,
Half Time and Lackland were the only
ones who elected to go against the speedy
Morris colt Filigrane in the Preakness,
and Half Time was made favorite. When
straightened out on the back stretch Half
Time was a length in front of Flligrane.
Here Lackland moved up and pocketed
Filigrane, and in the drive home Half

ST. LOI'IS, May 30.â The Memorial day
programme at the fair grounds, despite
the bad weather of the morning, drew an
immense holiday crowd. The principal
event of the day, the Memorial handicap,
was won by Fireside. Her stable com
panion, Gibraltar, was scratched. Fire
side was entered shortly before the day's
racing began. Her price, even at the odds
of 10 to 1, did not attract any heavy play.
Frank Bell. Cotton Plant and Dave
Waldo, the favorites, were played heavily,
but they were not in It, except Waldo,
who lust "showed."'
In the Memorial. Alleviate acted badly
at the post, delaying the start. Obsidian
broke through the gate several times,
causing a long delay. Finally the starter
brought them all into line and they got
away together. Headwater soon went to
the "front and showed the way to within
seventy yards of the wire, when Fire
side came like a flash and won by a head
oi: the post, ridden out from the pace
maker. Dave Waldo lasted just long
enough to nose out Cotton Plant. The

A PLACARD POSTED.
THE hackrueyed scribe who imitates literary work
in the yelknv bfliidmg at the intersection of Post
and Market streets placarded the railroad view
of the franchises before the Board of Supervisors in
the editorial columns of yesterday's Evening Post. As
the article was a combination of nonsense and
of falsehood, with a slight modification of the ordin
ary bullying tone of the railroad when addressing the
public.
Why any franchise should be granted for fifty years
when the municipality had determined to grant none
foi mon than twenty five: why no percentage should
be exacted for five years when a rate of at least .* per
cent for that period had been fixed: why abandoned
franchises should be resurrected: why the Market
Street Railway Company should be awarded a com
ilway monopolj on terms written by it
self: why the people should be cheated out of their
charter â the purveyor of purulent railroad mat
tei did not even pretend to explain. But he did
: i;p one inspire! lie and surround it with mean
ingless phrases. He urged that the franchises, for
which arrangements had been made with a supposed
majority of the Board of Supervisors, were open to
.<] that each would be secured by the
highest bidder. He failed t.i add that the entire
scheme of robbery had been so adjusted that the only
ible bidder would be the Market Street Railway
Company.
most familiar characterization of the railroad
despotism that has been too long tolerated in this
â¢ that the article contained was the denunciation
of the press and of the public as guilty of "a silly and
injurious agitation " Any man or any newspaper that
dares even to question the right of the railroad to
take any public property it covets, without compensa
sation. or to treat public officers as its own chattels,
has been for years liable not only to the vulgar abuse
of railroad hirelings, hut to realize railroad interfer
ence with business and even with social relations.
The creatures who are the servile tools of the Hnn
tinpton tyranny, used to force his dictatorial edicts
upon a free community, absolutely keep ledger ac
counts with reputable citizens all over the State, in
v. hich they are debited and credited according to their
independence or their subserviency. They are even in
the habit of parading necrologicul statistics in order,
like the Apaches, to display the scalps they have taken.
They pack municipal and legislative halls with the fes
tcrinc politicians they control, and. until forbearance

insulted its citizens.

and of decency attack men who have resisted their
bleeding propensities and who have expended rnil

appreciated their own mortality nor realized that at

the last campaign, the infamous candidacy of Daniel
M. Burns, the recent contemptuous parade of absolut

audacity with which it was sought to steal the last
remnants of municipal easements, have excited popu

After viewing calmly what a majority of the Board

PROBABLE DEFEAT OF STREET
RAILWAY ROBBERY.
THE card of Supervisor E. C. Kalben. printed in
another column of The Call of this date, is cred
itable to himself and deeply gratifying to the
public. If the actual intentions of that gentleman had
! been sooner disclosed he would have been relieved
fxoni apparently unmerited obloquy, which under the
j circumstances was inevitable. â 
Supervisors Per,rault, Deasy, Byington, Lackmann
and Heyer. who fought so manfully and so intelli
tly for the community at the last meeting of the
rd, with this accession to their number can pre
vent an affirmative vote in favor of any one of the
franchises or privileges demanded by the Market
Street Railway Company and -avert the necessity of a
further resort to parliamentary tactics or to legal
technicalities in order to defeat the atrocious fraud, for
! which there is no precedent in our municipal history.
! There is no reason to believe that the monopoly, with
! all its resources or through its available strategy, can
I produce any break in the ranks of these six municipal
! representatives, who thus stand committed to the un
compromising fulfillment of their duties under their
j official oaths.
The revised list of the railway salamanders, who are
' impenetrable to any possible appeal to their integrity,
. includes Supervisors Aigeltinger, Attridge, Black,
| Collins. Holland and Phelps. These men are inca
pable; of comprehending the controlling power of an
: honest motive in a public officer. Elected by the bal
lots of their fellow citizens, with pledges of upright
ness on their lips but with corruption and treachery
in their hearts, they will go down to posterity dis
graced beyond redemption, and leaving a heritage of
which their descendants will be ashamed. And while
they live, if the people of San Francisco are true to
3 and earnestly bent on a faithful adminis
tration of their local affairs, these men will be shunned
.nd, even though the application of this
drastic treatment may not wound their seared and
callous personalities, the example will not be lost upon
the ambitious politicians of the future.
Supervisor Kalben evidently agrees with The Call
in the proposition that the only way to meet public
expectation in the matter of the franchises which the
Market Street Railway Company has intrusted to its
agents in the board is to postpone their consideration
| until after the new charter goes into effect. It may be
said that, in respect to all subjects covered by that in
' strument, the principle of the referendum has been
| practically applied, and that the people of San Fran-
ci>co, with the indorsement of the State Legislature.
i have determined that no such -franchise shall he
' granted for more than twenty-five years, or without
i t lie immediate payment of percentages on gross re
o-ipt-;. to be increased after the lapse of five years, and
; that all the other restrictions that have heen adopted
i for the future protection of their municipality shall he
â enforced. As Supervisor Kalhen pertinently says: "The
city can acquire greater benefits through, the laws on
franchises in the new charter than it can under ex
| isting laws.'' To defeat the deliberate expression of
the public will even on these applications, which might
; ultimately be granted, by premature action under
railroad dictation, would be a transparent fraud and a
â¢ 'ng outrage.
Supervisor Kalhen also concurs with The Call and
his reputable colleagues in the hoard in holding that
j the street railway facilities, essential to the revival of
; the northeast part of San Francisco from its present
nation and favored by the Merchants' Association
and by thr North End Improvement Club, should he
granted, but not that, under cover of this necessary,
improvement, the Geary street franchise should be
surrendered and renewed, <~>r the abandoned franchise
on Geary street between Taylor street and Gram
avenue recognized. It also follows that at no time
should the new franchise along Grant avenue and
down Bush street to Sansome street be awarded. The
full measure of the relief desired by the Merchants'
Association and by the North End Improvement
j Club will he attained by the new franchise for one
Mock on Taylor street between Geary and Post
\ streets, and by the use of electricity on the Post street
tern, for which, as the City and County Attorney
has stated, no additional municipal legislation is re
quired.
Unless all signs fail, therefore, and an apparently
. impossible extension of railroad corruption occurs,
it may he assumed that the attempted robbery of San
, Francisco by the street railway monopoly is checked.
Even without the satisfactory revelation of the fact
that the railway only had six available tools in the
Ronrd of Supervisors, the parliamentary action of the
; ! minority of the board on Monday last, fearlessly sus
! tamed by Mayor Phelan. had greatly, minimized the
i danger that had excited so threatening an outburst of
. civic indignation. Not only has the right of the Mayor
to veto any rascally donation of public, easements and
: of the use of public streets been successfully estab
â ; lir-hed. but the soundness of Mr. Phelan's contention
that -ections 470 and 510 of the Civil Code, which,
, ; read together, provide that the use of any street,
, . alley or highway within any incorporated city or town I
; can only he awarded to a street railway corporation
I : by a two-third vote, applies to the scheme of the Mar
. i ket Street Railway Company, has not heen plausibly
I ; disputed. Unquestionably the act of 189;?, which pro
, hibits the granting of franchises within ninety days
. before or seventy days after a general election, is in
. full operation, and. therefore, the proposed surrender
f f the streets north of Market street would necessar
i ily have to be consummated by August 8.
Mayor Phelan and the minority of the Board of
I Supervisors at the last session of the board, uncon
. srinus of the reinforcement they have now fortu-
n ately received, unless there is some law or opera
. the rule to which our attention has not been directed,
. ' effectually blocked the railway game by a bold and
, decisive movement which, as Mr. Phelan observed,
. was dictated "by honest public policy." In order to
attend to the multifarious demands of public business
â  the board has been in the habit of adjourning from
week to week, or from one day to another, so that all
. the sessions held in a month were legally one meeting.
[ On Monday last the adjournment was sine die, and
. was so entered on the minutes. Section 67 of the
; consolidation act provides: "The Supervisors shall
â¢ i meet within five days after each annual election and
. , also on the first Monday of January, April, July and
October of each year, and at such other times as
. ! specially required by law. or they may, for urgent
. reasons, be specially convoked by the president of
. the board." The conclusion seems tp be irresistible
. that, unless "specially convoked" by Mayor Phelan, of
. which there is no danger, the Market Street Railway
Company's steal cannot be again obtruded until Mon
day, July 3, 1899. If this be the fact, then the interval
. between that date and August 8 would be insufficient
for the completion of the robbery, even though pro
. pelled at the greatest attainable railroad speed.
. I There are now six members of the Board of Su
pervisors, with the Mayor at their head, who deserve
I sincere commendation. And on the main issue it
[ i self, unless there is some new concoction to be Qrigin
â¢ j ated by railway ingenuity, San Francisco is to be con
jgratulated on its escape from an unendurable calamity.
THE SAN FKAXCISOO CALL, WEDNESDAY, MAY 31, 1899.
THE DISCONTENT IN CUBA.
T REPORTS from Cuba are by no means reassur
bâ/ ing, and it now looks as if serious disturbances
may yet occur there. The so-called "patriots,"
and they deserve that title about as well as any other,
have shown a decided unwillingness to surrender their
arms even when advised to do so by their commander,
Gomez, and when offered by the United States
$3,000,000.
Dispatches of Saturday from Havana state that
while our disbursing officer in that province has on
his list the names of 4317 Cuban soldiers entitled to
receive their share of the $3,000,000, less than eleven
applied for the money on the day the disbursing
office opened, and he is quoted as having said it is
doubtful if fifty of them do so. Fifty is but a small
number of "good" Cubans out of over 4000, and the
outlook is ominous.
The opposition of the rank and file of the Cuban
army to surrendering their arms is probably due to a
variety of causes of which patriotism is. only one, and
perhaps not the most potent. When men have been
for years living a kind of guerrilla life in a mild cli
mate, where it is no hardship to sleep out of dottrs
and go without food on occasions, they come at last
tv like the life, to feel an attachment for their rifles
and their knives; they like their companionship, and
naturally hesitate to surrender to a power almost un
known to them, which begins by taking from them
their arms and then disbands them. The amount of
money which each will receive out of the $3,000,000
is not very large even to a Cuban, and the entice
ments of coin, moreover, are not so great to tropical
people as some persons in the temperate zone im
agine.
There is another factor in the problem which merits
consideration. If reports from Havana be correct our
military administration there has not been the wisest
in the world. It appears to have been undertaken in
the spirit of reform, which is commendable, but it has
been carried out in the manner of United States re
formers, and that doesn't suit Cuba. When a people
have been accustomed all their lives to certain forms
of living it is not always advisable to compel them to
change suddenly and by military force, even if the life
be to some extent vicious.
The enforcement of Sunday laws, for example, such
as the closing of all business houses and the prohibi
tion of public games and entertainments on that day;
the abrupt suppression of the gambling rooms which
for years have been places of popular resort; the pro
hibition against smoking in streetcars and forbidding
any one to appear on the streets in undershirts, are
among the reforms that might have been left for edu-'
cation to accomplish. It is doubtful if even Washing
ton City or Boston would like such laws enforced by
soldiers.
As a matter of fact, snme of the military regulations
appear like petty tyranny, and were it not for the re
ports of them given in ?o many of the Eastern ex
changes of known accuracy it would be difficult to
accept them as true. They can hardly he other than
irritating. The Cubans have a morality and manners
of their own, suited to their climate and to their race,
and the reform regulations reported to have been
proclaimed there are not likely either to improve the
people or pacify them. It is, therefore, not wholly
strange that the patriots prefer to keep their arms and
take to the woods.
MARCHAND'S RECEPTION.
PARIS has had something of good fortune in the
course of events which have brought about the
decision of the Court of Cassation on the Drey
fus case at a time when popular attention is largely
taken up with preparations for the grand reception to
be given Jilajor Marchand on his return from his dan
gerous mis-ion to Central Africa. With public en
thusiasm aroused for the man who for the moment is
the hero of France, there will be less likelihood of an
outbreak than there would have been had nothing
occurred to distract the thoughts of the masses from
the Dreyfus controversy.
The work accomplished by Marchand in his march
across Africa will not have the great effects which
were expected of it. It appears that his mission was to*
make h\< way from the French possessions in Africa
across the divide to the Nile basin, where he was to
launch gunboats, and make his way to Fashoda, and
possibly Khartoum. He was to be followed by other
expeditions constituting a force strong enough to hold
the territory against the Mahdists, and thus place
France in possession of the abandoned provinces of
Egypt in the Soudan.
As his mission was a secret one, the force Riven him
was small. He made his way through the wilds of
Africa under circumstances of extreme difficulty. Dur
ing the march he proved himself to be one of the
boldest and most resourceful explorers and leaders of
our times. He reached the Nile, only to find that while
he had been struggling through the wildernesses and
the swamps. General Kitchener, with a British and
Egyptian army, had made a march up the Nile and
was in military possession of the land in dispute. Mar
chand therefore saw all his work was in vain. There
was nothing for him to do but to make a claim for
France and leave the i^sue to be settled by diplomacy,
as has been since arranged.
The failure of the military' and political features of
the expedition in no wise detracts from the credit due
to the intrepid explorer. Marchand did his work will,
and fully deserves any honor his country or his coun
trymen will bestow upon him. He at least placed
France in a position from which she could demand
concessions of trade rights along the Nile, and that,
while slight in comparison with what he hoped for, is
something out of which French trade may derive
great profit.
A stabbing affray at Harbor View, a picnic cutting
scrape on the way home, the deadly use of a knife
in a family row. the brutal beating of an aged
lodging-house keeper, the threatened death of a man
from a flying cuspidor, murderously sent on its mis
tiott, and a fistic entertainment of savage earnestness
on the water front, is the Sabbath record of the shad
ows of a big city.
The C/.ar's peace conference at The Hague has ap
pcinted a "drafting committee*' with the avowed pur
pose of making an acceptable combination of the de
mands made by representatives of Russia and Great
Britain. A slip of the pen would have made that
committee what many people believe it will prove
itself to beâ a "grafting committee?"
Fears that the Cubans would not take kindly to the
American system of political government are rapidly
being dissipated. The soldiers of Gomez have already
demonstrated that they have learned a lesson in
American primary politics. They have been caught
stuffing the rolls.
At a conference recently closed by the religious sect
of Dunkards, it wns unanimously decided that neck
ties never should be worn except for health. There
are a few tenants of "murderers' row" at San Quen
tin who accept that dogma with the utmost enthu
siasm*
GENTLE SPRING OFF FOR A SUMMER VACATION.
PETE McGLADE
IS ONCE MORE
IN THE TOILS
Arrested by Detective
Gibson.
IN HIDING AT THE MANSFIELD
WAS LOCATED THROUGH THE
TRANSOM.
He Was Playing Cards With a Boon
Companion and Wilted When
He Was Discov
ered.
Peter W. McGlade was arrested yester
day afternoon on a bench warrant by De
tectlve Thomas Gibson at the Mansfield
House on Post street, above Grant ave
nue.
McGlade has hoen in hiding ever Bince
his indictment by the Grand Jury on May
22 on the charge of forgery, and it was
thought that ho had skipped for parts
unknown. Detective Gibson has hern
| working hard to discover his whereabouts
and succeeded in locating him by shadow
ing Park Jones, a former employe of the
registration office, and a close friend of
Mc<;iade.
Yesterday afternoon Gibson employed a
messenger boy to follow Jones and the
latter went into the Mansfield. Gibson
soon entered the house, hut could gel no
satisfaction from the landlady, Mrs. Mil
ler, regarding his suspicion that McGlade
was secreted in the house. The Chinese
servant employed there was equally as
reticent, but managed to blurt out that
"one big man had not left his room for a
week.".
This gave Gibson a clew, and learning
! from the messenger boy that Jones had
! disappeared somewhere on the second
I floor, he began a systematic investigation.
i He climbed up on the shoulders of Of
i ficer Purves and peered through the glass
transoms, with which each door .is pro
vided. After he had inspected several
rooms in this manner he finally came, to
No. 21 and there discovered McGlade in
b.is shirtsleeves, playing cards with Moose
Taylor, a former jockey at the Oakland
track.
McGlarle threw down the cards at Gib
son's apparition, and then with a sickly
smile said:
"Hello; you here again?"'
Seeing that the "jig was up," McGlade
went quietly with Gibson to the Central
I Station. Bail had been fixed on the for
gery charge at $3000.
McGlade refused to say anything about
his disappearance, but appeared to be dis
appointed that his bonds were not ready
as soon as he was booked. It is thought
that he intended to remain in hiding until
his attorney. Patrick Reddy, had returned
from Idaho, where he has gone to try
snme mining cases.
Detective Gibson expressed himself as
highly elated at McGlade's capture, as it
! was he who located the fugitive in Mex
ico, when he was first brought back.
"McGlade's friends," said Gibson, "were
around boasting that he would never be
located, and I made up my mind to catch
him if it was the last act of my life."
THE EVILS OF
EXAMINATIONS
Editor of The Callâ Dear Sir: I was
glad to see in to-day's Call a protest
against school examinations. I hope this
matter will be taken up by the parents
and with your permission thoroughly agi
tated in your paper. As a parent. I would
gladly help in such an agitation. A few
years ago, when a member of the State
Normal School, I saw Its "cruel and un
just" work. Young' women who were
short of funds and short In time, feel
ii.g the necessity of soon being at work,
would become so nervous during the cru
cial hour that we could tell by their burn-
Ing cheeks and anxious expression as they
came from the classroom that th^y had
been having an examination. I knew one
young woman, hard worked and conscien
tious, who became absolutely helpless at
one of these tests and could do nothing
at. all, and wns marked a â¢failure. Will
some physician please tell us what effect
upon the health these strains have? It
is the same in the country schools as In
the town. This afternoon an 11-year-old
boy on his way home from a Whole day
of "county examinations" stopped at my
door on an errand. He appeared sick and
at the point of crying. In answer to my
inquiry, he said his head ached and he
fuessed ft was the writing that made it.
t seems to me as though we parents are
furnishing the material in our children
for Boards of Education to have ground
throughout their educational systems re
gardless of their nerves, their anxieties,
their fears and tlu'lr sufferings. f say.
tno, do away with these examinations ;md
let the monthly- report cards made up
from daily recitations, averaged for the
year, decide the matter of promotion. The

as barbarous and not animated by hu
manitarian ideas.
The meeting was called to order by
Thomas Bashford, who introduced G. IS.
lien ham as the Qrst speaker of the even
ing
"We are here to-night," .said Mr. Ben
ham, "tv protest emphatically against the
late war which was carried on In the
name of despotism and followed in . its
wake by death ... . destruction. We have
Been Cuban patriots refuse to take the
gold lor which was sold their honor.
â¢While this nation was commended in the
beginning for its disinterested assistance
to a down-trodden people, events have oc
curred which have changed the aspect of
the case, and now there are none so poor
in spirit or in judgment to do her rever
ence or honor.
"This country's Hag waves over a scene
of despotism in the Philippine Islands.
When the doctrine was promulgated that
the people of Cuba are ot right and should
be iree, Â«i might} thrill of approbation
swept over this land. Bui when our mili
tary supremacy was edtaolished the cu
bans found tliemseivt* in tne exact posi
tion in tile exercise â â¢! their sovereignty
as they had been under Spanish rule.
Twenty uiuusunu Filipinos surrendered
their lives rather than gi\e up their llu
erty."
E. J. Kingsley in the course of his
speech saio: "Armed murderers have
marched beneath the glorious American
Hag to deprive people uf their liberty.
The Hag has been sold and resold for
profit until the very clothes on Uncle
bain's back smack ot the bargain count
er. Few wars have been toujftit with a
worthy purpose, and tne war against
Spain is a capitalistic war which has be
smirched the tair name of tne United
btates. The soldiers came mainly from
the working classes, and they received
death in return for the self-sacrifice,
while the officers got a Jittle cheap glory.
"Every citizen should protest witn his.
last breath against the brutality of the
war and endeavor to overcome the dan
ger which lurks behind the scheme,
namely, military despotism. If It be
treason to protest against ruthless mur
der, rapine, invasion ot the rigrhts of peo
ple, against the military drilling of our
children in our public schools and the
'other evils that beset our land, then we
plead guilty and, in the language of Pat
rick lieiirv, "make the most of it.' "
A. It. Andre next referred to the incon
sistency, of the peace conference now In
session at The Hague behind closed
doors, while the very powers interested in
it are busy making implements of war
and building battleships.
"If the Socialists ..â¢â¢â¢â¢ been in power."
he said, "this terrible disgrace would
never have been visited upon us in this
war. The American nation will get no
benefit from it. The private ownership
of the means of production and distrlbu- j
tlon; which was the incentive of the war,
should be abolished. All wars should bo !
discountenanced, and the remedy for cap- j
itallsm is socialism."
M. W. Wilkins was the last speaker,
and he deplored the fact that huraanitar- !
ianlsm was not the inspiring motive of !
the war. "The war had but one pur- |
pose." he said, "to open up new fields j
of exploitation for the capitalists and
make them the masters therein. I very
much doubt the consistency of a govern
ment which goes to the rescue of an op
pressed foreign people and is so callous i
to the w^liare of her own suffering peo- i
pie on hor own 8011. Four or five million
people right here within our own confines !
are denied the chance of earning an hon- '
est living. I must inveigh against th.->
terrible tn-atmont of our bray.> ildiera
whereby ten have died in the camp or In I
the hospital for every one that died on I
the battlefield. I protest against such a I
terrible condition of things in the name *
of the soldier who has gone to his last i
sleep and In the name of the griff-strick
en orphan, the widow, the mother and the '
sweetheart.
"War will disappear only when the :
blood-red banner of international fratÂ»r
nalism shall wave its sacred folds over i
the. Federation of the World."

BASEBALL PATRONS FLEECED
I TWO TABES COLLECTED FOR A
RIDE TO THE GROUNDS.
Contemptible Scheme for Evading
the Issuing of Transfers to the
Eighth-Street Electric
Line.
The conductors on the four lima "f
1 ruble cars running on Market street are
compelled to become participants in* about
the meanest form of petty lan. i.y . y.t
â¢ ontrivcd by H. K. Huntingdon and Henry
H. Lynch on behalf of the Market-street
Railway Company. It la a scheme utterly
devoid of right or excuse and lacks even
the merit of ingenuity; it is simply a
barefaced plan to fleece the patrons of
the ball games out of an extra nickel.
On the 2nd of -May the new electric
j line on Eighth street wan opened for
; traffic and announcement was made that
a system of transfers with the cars run
. ning on Market street had been adopted.
Previous to that time the company had
. run a horse-car from Eighth and Market
to Recreation Park, at the corner of
Eighth and Harrison streets, under an
agreement with the baseball managi re,
for the convenience of patrons on days
that games were played. The Market
street company is now exacting toll from
the public for that doubtful convenience.
At the rear end of the Market-street
tn type so small that it would re
quire exceptionally good eyes to read it
half the length of the ear, is a notice in
forming passengers from downtown wish
. ing- to transfer to the Eighth-street line,
: that they must ask the conductor for a
transfer at the time of paying their fare.
Nol even this much notification is given
passengers on the dummy and not one
passenger in one hundred riding inside
; the car would ever see it.
The conductors carefully refrain from
asking passengers when collecting fare
if they want to transfer a t that point.
and as the rule does not prevail at any
other transfer point on Market street pas
rs never once think of asking for a
. at the tiinr of paying their fare â 
that is. not until they have been victim
ized once at least. But few people from
downtown ever transfer to Eighth street
except patrons of the ball games. A Large
. of the latter, however, take that
. and it is to trap those pleasure-
Beekers that the scheme is enforced. One
can come down on any of the lines and
never have to think of his transfer; the
conductors on the Valencia, Castro,
Haight and Hayes-street lines ,uo through
the ears making the usual announce]
Just before Eighth Btreet la reached on
the down trip and transfers are Issued
then, i'.ut few if anj of the baseball en
thusiasts come from those directions.
They are mostly downtown business men
and clerks who have to travel '>ut to -
Eighth street.
Many and vigorous have been th>- com- â 
plaints made at this Innovation >--\ the
"pan*! game," and yesterdaj afternoon a
fall reporter Investigated it. Boarding
car 184 of the Haight-street line, at Mar
ket and Kearny streets, he Beated himself
on the dummy. The conductor collected
his fare after passing Grant avenue, at
the same time announcing transfers to
Ellis-street line. A block further up
town the conductor again came out on the
dummy and announced transfers for
Powell, Eddy and Fifth Btreeta Even at
Btreet he called out transfers to the
jerky little bobtails creeping down that
thoroughfare, bui when the car neared
Rii:iith there was no movement on his
part t i Issui transfers. Nor had he made
any mention <.f it when he collected fare.
The reporter beckoned to him and de
manded a transfer to Eighth street, but
was refuse.), the conductor stating that
In- was merely obeying orders, and that
notice was posted In tne rear of the car
to the effect that passengers must ask
f'>r transfers at the time of paying fare.
Th'- reporter saw the notice, but it would
been Impossible to read It with opera
ea from where he was Beated. H.
called attention to the fad that I
was no notice posted for the in petit of
passengers on tne dummy, but the con
ductor said It was not his fault: he was
merely obeying orders, and if the passen
ared to lie could make his protest
to the superintendent. He looked as
though he heartily wish, d somebody
would protest to the superintendent vig
ly enough to cause the abolishment
of the rule, tor 11 was palpable that he 1
little liking for the part in the plun- ;
der of the public he had to play.
The reporter wenl back downtown and'
boarded another car, this time one of
the Castro-street line, the number of
which Is withheld as a measure of pro
n of the conductor. The same
method of iesulng transfers at all the
points further down was adopted, every
passenger on the car and dummy being
ugnly Informed that transfer.- could
be obtained. But at Kfghth street the
same silnece prevailed. Again the oon
â  was summoned and again a trans
i fer was demanded. This time there were
several hall cranks on the dummy, and
too. demanded checks. The con
i expostulated and called attention
â¢ notice in the back end of the car,
but after considerable discussion he re
luctantly gave the desired transfers,
though all the time protesting that he '
waa not obliged to issue them. He, too,
fully refrained from asking the pas
sengers when ho collected their fare, or
my other time, if they wanted to:
transfer to Eierhth street.
From a Hayes-street conductor It was:
learned thai the ostensible reason for,
i this petty larceny was to prevent passen- i
from making a continuous trip i
j around the city on one fare, as though
; anybody had the time or inclination to i
] get ahead .if the company In that way.
He said he believed there was a system
I of transfers by which a passenger trans
ferring at some point downtown to a
Mark, t-street car and again to Eighth
I street could again transfer and return
to the point of starting :i t a cosl of a'
nickel. The plan was adopted of making
passengers to Eighth street ask f..r trans
fers when thej paid their fare, bo that
conductors W..11M know whether the\- ,
â ash or a transfer; if the latter, then
be would refuse to Issue another The in
formant winked as he rattled this off. and
it was evident he had not figured out how
this wonderful endless journej could be
made.

burns yesterday afternoon at the home |
of h.r aunt, Mrs. Charles S. Nathan. 242' i
Buena VIStS avenue, Alameda, which
later t. nnlnated fatally.
In some way unknown the child, with j
her little cousins, Florence and Mamie
Tblmon, aged 4 and ft years respectively,
( btained coal oil and matches, which the
â  three children carried to a summer house
in the rear of the Nathan home. Here
the oil was Ignited by the Denahy child. ''
. and the explosion which followed set fire j
t'i her clothes and she was immediately ,
enveloped in flames. The two younger
children were unable to render any .-is
sistance to their burning playmate, and, j
screaming with agony. Lottie ran through j
the yard and into one of the basement j
rooms of the Nathan residence occupied
by Mrs. M. 1- itzfcerald. The latter on
seeing the child's fearful plight, was at
first badly frightened, but picked up a
large floor mat and wrapping it around
thi screaming and roasting little one
rolled her on the floor in a vain attempt
t. smother the flames.
As the flames continued to flare out
from the folds of the mat. Mrs. Fitz
gerald rushed outdoors with her burning !
: man burden and rolled the screaming
( hild in the soft sand of the back yard.
Bhe spread sand on the burning remnants
Of the child's clothing which still clung
to the little sufferer's helpless form, and
In this way the fire was completely
smothered.
J>rs. Pond and Bull were summoned,!
and on examination found that the child's
body was burned in a horrible manner.
I arge pieces of cuticle peeled off at the
touch of the physicians' hands and it was
found necessary to put the child under
the Influence of opines while her little]
body was being swathed in oil and Cotton.
Last evening the sufferer was conveyed ;
to the Oakland Receiving Hospital.
Dr. Ptratton and the other physicians
and surgeons at the Receiving Hospital
expressed \( rv meager hopes of saving
the child's life, owing to the extensive j
â  skin area affected. They worked over ;
the little body faithfully until late to- i
night, but wltli no avail, for shortly after \
II o'clock death ended the ch'lld's suffer- j
firs M. Fitzgerald, who was the only
one In the Nathan house when the ai ci
dent occurred, gives her verstnTi of the
affair as follows: "I was sitting in one.
Ol the basement rooms when I heard ter- j
rible screaming coming from some one of j
th. children in the back yard. As I |
arose to Bee what the matter was Lottie
ai pea red in the doorway, and was a mass ,
of tlames from head to foot. She rushed j
at in- and I picked up a mat lying on
the Moor and wrapping it about the I
reaming child I endeavored to smother j
the flames. As the flames kept burning |
; mv arms and wrists 1 ran with the child
ir.to the yard and rolled her in the sand.
â¢Hid In that way I succeeded In putting
out the fire in what remained of the.
child's clothes. 1 do not know how the
children got the oil. but one of the little
' ones says Lottie put matches In her
pecket fast night and to-day got the oil
I from a can in the cellar."
The burned child's mother is dead. The
child went to Alameda last Sunday on a
visit to her cousins, tne children of Mrs.
Charles S. Nathan.

MYSTERIOUS
LOSS OF THE
PELICAN SOLVED
Foundered in a Gale
Off Alaska.
THE TRANSPORT GRANT SAILS
SOLDIERS GIVEN TWO MONTHS'
PAY BEFORE LEAVING.
Captain Frank Tuttle of the Bear Has
Taken Command of the Golden
Gateâ Notes From thÂ©
Front.
The first authentic news bearing upon
the loss of the British steamer Pelican
was receiver] from Kodiak, Alaska, yes
terday by the Merchants' (Exchange, It
was a memorandum from the chief officer,
stating that the vessel was sinking and
the crew was taking to the boats. The
memorandum was put In a bottle some
time in October, 1897, and was picked up
on the 15th lnst. on the beach at Portage
Ray. Alaska, by the master of the sealing
schooner Herman and sent to San Fran- !
cisco.
The memorandum was written on the j
form used by Dodwell, Carill & Co. (now j
Dodwell & Co., Ltd.) of Hongkong, agents
for the Northern Pacific Steamship Com
pany, and was as follows:
P. S. Pelican.
Latitude BO north, longitude 175 west.
The ship is sinking. We are leaving her In
frail boats, Please report us.
M. T. PATTERSON. Chief Officer.
Port Townpend. Wash., U. S. A.
The letter accompanying the above was
as follows:
KODIAK. Alaska, May 18, ISM
To Merchants' Exchange, San Francisco:
Inclosed please find a letter extracted from a
bottle and picked up on the l.'.tli of May on the 'â 
beach In Portage Hay, on the peninsula of
Alaska. Latitude 57 degrees 34 minutes north,
longitude 156 decree? 3:. minutes west. It will
probably throw some light on the mystery of
a miÃslng vessel, probably the Pelican.
F. tiunki.u
Master American Schooner Herman.
The Pelican was an English tramp
steamer owned by E. S. Whealler of
Hongkong and under charter to the
Northern Pacific Steamship Company.
She took a cargo of general merchandise
from Hongkong to Puget Bound and then
loaded railroad ties at Port Gamble for
I Taku. China. She sailed from Gamble
on October 3, 1897, and was never seen i
again. On February 9, i v . |S . Bhe was given
up as lost and Lloyds posted her as "miss
ing."
After leaving the Sound, the captain
must have taken the "great circle" route
to China. The bottle that was thrown
overboard took a northwest course and
after covering 420 miles of latitude and
1235 miles of longitude landed on the
beach in Portage Hay.
About the time the Pelican went down
the Japanese steamer Kagoshuma Maru,
the barkentlne Skagit and schooner Ma
weema were out in a fearful storm off
the Aleutian Islands. The steamer had
her cargo shifted and nearly went down,
the barkentine was badly battered and
the Maweema had to send several of her
crew to the hospital when she reached
Tacoma, they having been injured during
the gale. On March 23, IS9S, the British
ship Falkirk reached Taooma from Shang- j
hai and Captain Helmes reported passing
a waterlogged lifeboat off the Aleutian Isl
! ands. It was a â  lnp-streaked boat' and
was generally supposed to have belonged
to the Pelican, but later the Northern
Pacific people after looking Into the mat
ter paid it was not one of the Pelican's
boats. The steamer carried a crew of
forty all told and Captain Gove was In
command.
The Pelican was built in ISB2 by Bar
clay, Curie & Co. of Glasgow for Seater,
White & Co. of Leith. She ran for a
number of years on- the Atlantic and
then was sold, her new owners changing
her name to Anvers. She was again sola
to E. S. Whealler of Hongkong, who re- i
named her the Pelican and placed her in '
1 the China trade. She was 2338 tons gross !
; and 10&9 tons net burden, 327 feet 6 Inches
long, 3G feet 9 inches beam and 27 feet !
deep.
As a verification of the foregoing, a
dispatch . was received late last night
from Tacoma saying: "M. T. Patterson
was chief officer of the missing steamer
Pelican. His family resides at Port
Townsend."
The United States transport Grant <
tailed for Manila yesterday with the of- ;
ficers and men of the Sixteenth Infantry.
The vessel was ready to sail last Monday
night, but as the men had not received
any money for two months, the Govern
merit decided to pay them before sending
them away to Manila. After getting their
money the soldiers resorted to all kinds
oÂ£ expedients to get off the wharf and
spend some of it. A. few of them suc
ceeded, but the majority wore caught be
fore they got ashore. Three of the mem
bers of 'Company H jumped overboard in
order to gain their end. Two of them
made their escape, but the third was cap
tured. Two men got through the barbed
wire on the top of the fence and got their ,
hands and wrists lacerated, but they |
reached the saloon across the road and |
were correspondingly happy. Some of the |
crew of the vessel made their escape
down the mooring cables and othe rs
slipped down under the wharf and swam
ashore. Tub was kept on every man as
he returned to the ship and every on< 0]
them will have to do penam- I bread
and water fur the a rink he secured by
bit aking bounds.
<^uite a number of the volunteer en
gineers who were stationed at Honolulu
have secured position-; In Hawaii ami are
going back there to live, in considera
tion of their past services Uncle Sam is
giving them transportation to Honolulu.
Fifteen of them went away on the Grant
and thirty-live more are going on the
Sheridan. They are all California boys
and the following seven are from Com
pany L: M. Hall. George Brown, Harry
Wolf, Frank Raven, D. Hartman, D.
Dunlop and Pat Sealander. All of these
have been engaged to help in the survey
ing of the Oahu plantation, while the
ethers are going .v- engineers, black
smiths, carpenters and masons. In Hawaii
carpenters are getting $4, blacksmiths $5
and masons $6 a day. At least, that is
what the boya who are going down on the
transports are to get.
As the Grant steamed down the bay
aimost every vessel In port bade her good
by. As she passed the British ship Bal
clutha the latter'.s flag was dipped and
the crew gave three cheers for the soldier
boys. Not to be outdone the salute was
answered from the Giant, while the regi
mental band played "God Save the
Queen."
Some of the officers of the Naval Rat
talion paid a visit to the Japanese train
ing ship Hiyel yesterday In the Bdarion's
launch. They were First Assistant Ad
jutant General Baugham, Paymaster
Douglas White, Lieutenant Commander
Nearney, Captain Lindsey and Ensigns
Armstrong. .Morrison and Peterson. They
were royally entertained by the officers
of the warship and spent nearly all the
afternoon aboard.
Max Kalish, the popular agent of tho
steamer Humboldt. paid a Hying visit to
the city yesterday. The Humboldt ia
now plying between -Seattle ami Skaguay
and is getting more than her share of the
passenger trade. Mr. Kalish came down
from Seattle with Captain Frank Tuttle
of the revenue cutter Bear. They were
on the train that was in collision with
some freight cars near Oregon City, but
did not know there had been an accident
until the trainmen told them. Mr. Kalish
returned to Seattle last night, but Cap
tain Tuttle will remain in San Francisco.
At the last moment he was given leave
of absence on account of the serious ill
ness of his wife. The Bear is now on her
way to Bering Sea. Captain Tuttle has
been placed in command of the revenue
cutler Golden Gate.
Tho British ship Glpnard arrived from
Newcastle, England, yesterday after a
long cruise of 168 days. She sailed from
South Shields on December 23, and a
week lat'-r went ashore at Dungeness In !
a thick fog. The next day she was tow. 'I
i iff and anchored in the Downs. It took!
three weeks to survey and find out that j
she was not damaged, and on January 21
she madf another start for Ran Fran
cisco. The passage thereafter was un
eventful.

DEFEATED IN
THE ELEVENTH
Locals Win an In and
Out Game.
HARD HITTING THE FEATURE
STATESMAN HARVEY'S PUZZLES
EASY TO SOLVE.
Krug Is Placed in the Outfield After
railing Down at Short and Does
Some Marvelous
ThroTHng.
Pan Francisco won an p!f>v<->n-lnnlng
pa mo of baseball fr'iin Sacramento yester
day by a Bcore of 7 to 5. The game itself
TViis thp queerest combination of hits and
errors, Btupid work and marvelous field-
Ing, and, above all, ragtime decisions by
R. Levy, umpire, that has been dished up
this Be i
Between 3000 and MOO popple submitted
to the latest mode of extortion by the
Market-street Companj and went to Rec
reation Park, and for six innings they
-hardly kept awake, although the
score was tied twice in the#early stages.
The play was slow and uninteresting to
â¢ gree. Thru the performers
took a sudden brace rind from that time
on until Harvey*, the pitcher, gave the
game away In the eleventh, it was fast
ie most critical fanatic to
yapping.
The left-handed statesman made his ini
tial appearance in the box at the local
grounds this season and fared badly at
the hands of Uncle Hank's heavy
weights. Dr. Pyne being the star per
former with the stick. It must be said.
). wever, that Harvey suffered severely at
the hands of the umpire, but notwlth-
Ing he struck out seven men.
Iberg was touched up for thirteen hits, j
two los= than hi* adversary, but he only j
fooled two batsmen and gave the same
number of bases as Harvey.
Krug started in at short, imt after two
errors in the first Inning which cost as ;
many runs and another in the second that !
gave Sacramento another tally he was
removed to center field, and Pyne was j
brought Into short. The change was a
surprise in both ways, for the doctor put;
up a g i game in bis new position, while
Krug'a work in the outfield was of the
tional order. Twice be fielded a man
out at the plate from deep center by his
marvelous throwing. If Krug is wia
will remain in the outfield permanently,
â¢ iral position and will earn
him an enviable reputation. Pyne, with
a little experiem I I i make equally
as n i an Infield* r.
. at third earned the fielding medal
for !!!â¢â  locals, some of ins assists and
;s being worthy of reproduction on
any vaudeville stage He also increased
Jrls batting average by three swats.
The Senators showed great improve- ,
: in their work, with the exception j
ise running. A gang of Chinamen
Could discount them at that. I>oyle, in!
righ' field, came in on a grounder by Sul
livan and threw the bailer out at first,
but Rube wouldn't stand for it, so it had
1.. go as a single.
Two runs fell to Sacramento in the
first inning. With one out Harvey
cracked a double. Doyle singled and went
to Becond on the throw in. which held
Harvey at third. Egan drove one to
Krug, who fumbled, allowing Harvey to <
score, After Stanley had popped up a i
fly to Riley, Iberg gave Stultz a pass,
filling the bases. Krug got in another
i when MeLaughlin drove one to
him. and Doyle scored. Shanahan's out,
Iberg to Sullivan, ended the trouble for
the time being. In the second, however, j
Murphy made the circuit on a base on i
balls. Harvey's Bingle, i berg's error and
Krug':- bad judgment.
Frisco evened matters up in the third i
by hammering in three tallies. Pyne '
opened with a single and took second on i
Harvey's wide throw to head him off. i
Krug fouled out, after which Riley
d the runner with a single. His
â hot was duplicated In turn by Sullivan. ,
Hiidebrandt and Muller, scoring two
more runs. Harvey then settled down,
and the next two batters were easy outs.
Another run was added to their string in I
the fifth, Hiidebrandt opening with a sin-]
gle. taking second on O'Neil's Infield hit. j
Stealing third and scoring on Swindells' ;
drive to Murphy, who made a vain at- :
tempt to head off the runner.
Sacramento knotted the score in the j
Sixth, Sheehan making the circuit on his i
â  and O'Neil's error.
From that time on until the eleventh
Inning not a run was made, and the gome
was as prettj an exhibition as could be
â¢wished for. Then came the explosion.
Harvey soaked Sullivan, the first man up,
With the ball. Hiidebrandt followed with
an easy one to Harvey, who threw into
deep center in an endeavor to pinch Sul
livan at second, and both runners com
pleted the circuit. Muller followed with
a single' and got around on errors by
Egan and Stultz. Sacramento gol one
In its half on a brace of singles and an
error, but a double play blighted all
e h. .!â â â ! of any more. The score:

WATSONVILLE, May 30. â Pitted
against nine Sand Crabs and an umpire
Farmer Struve's Sugar Beets came within
one tally of winning out to-day. If Um
pire Cahill retains his official position it
Is a safe proposition to buy pools on Santa
Cruz winning the pennant. The Crabs
boast that Cahill is the greatest umpire
in baseballdom, and is always wined and
banqueted on his trips to Santa Cruz.
Up to the sixth inning to-day the score
was 2 and 2. Donlin went to feat and put
a foul over the righ field fence. Cahill
called it fair and let him take second
base. It was the rawest decision made
in a baseball game this season. In the
eighth inning, with two men out, Balsz hit
a fair ball In the right territory and Ca
hill yelled "Foul!". It was an attempt
to square his former decision when It
would do the Crabs the least harm.
In that inning a new ball was thrown
out to the umpire, given by him to Balsz.
and then the latter deliberately threw It
out into a strawberry field. It was sent
back to him again by the umpire, when
Devereauz got hold of it and threw it
further away. Courtney, who was on sec
ond, came home. Finally the new ball
was again recovered and Balsz agreed to
twirl it. In the face of all this raw work
Cahill ordered Courtney back to second.
The most remarkable play of the game
outside of Cahllls work was Donlin's
catch of a batted ball in deep center and
his return to the plate in time to put out
Courtney, who was running from second.
Score:

BOXERS AWAIT THE
REFEREE'S SIGNAL
George Green and Al Neill will meet to
night in Woodward's Pavilion for a
twenty-round bout, under th- auspices of
the Western Boxing Club. The match has
excited unusual attention, as both nun
are young Callfornians. Green has won
fame, as an athlete outside the borders of
this State, while his opponent is nearing
the top of the championship ladder with
giant strides
Although but a novice in the ring Neill
has, by his recent showing with Tom
Traeey, a veteran at the game, gained
the confidence of many sporting men.
This Is shown by the betting. It was ex
pected Green would open a 10 to 7 or s
favorite, but Instead of that the first odds
chalked up were 10 to 9. This will prob
ably be the ruling price when the men
enter the ring, although the pressure of
Xeill money may make, it an even-money
chance.
Neill did his training at Blankin's Six
mile House and is pronounced lit to right
for his life. He has not required much
conditioning, as he hardly went out of
training since he made his professional
debut with Frank McConnell some months
since. Green has been in almost the
same condition. He prepared carefully
for a meeting with â¢'Mysterious Billy"
Smith, which did not take place owing "to
the latter's withdrawal. He has not over
trained recently, but took only enough
exercise to keep on edge. Neither man
has experienced any difficulty in making
the weight stipulated, 154 pounds, so they
will have no excuses to offer on that
score.
Notwithstanding the confidence of
Neill's friends the wise division looks to
Green to lower his colors. The latter Is
pronounced a clever ring general and
knows all the tricks of the boxer's art.
He Is considered just the man to stop th"
gallop of even so promising a boxer as
Xeill. This speculation on the outcome
of the bout has not had a depressing
effect on either Xeill or his friends, toe
latter believing he is Improving as a
boxer every day.
The preliminary between Jimmy Law
lor and Billy Otts is a promising one.
Both r. re willing boxers and are capable
of good work with the gloves.
Walter Watson will referee the main
event, while Joe Acton will pass upon
the preliminaries, if they go the limit of
ten rounds each.

GATHERING OF
THE LADS IN
TARTAN PLAIDS
Caledonian Club's An-
nual Outing.
The "skirl o' the pipes' "and the "hoot
! mons" heard at Shell Mound Park yes
terday gave evidence of the fact that the
is had gathered once again, and it
was acknowledged to be one of the most
! successful events in the history of the
(lonian Club during its. thirty-three
years of < xistence.
There were more people assembled on the
grounds than for many years back, and
th' Ir expectations that the games com
mittee would provide an attractive pro
gramme of events were more than fully
realized.. The chief, Angus McLeod, and
the other members of the committee were
1 here, there and everywhere yesterday,
from 10 o'clock in the morning, when the
; game- commenced, till 6 o'clock in the
â¢.veiling, when the last event on the pro
gramme was concluded. The chief was
ably assisted by William Mitchell, Daniel
A. McDonald, George McDonald, An
drew McNair, .1. li. Duncan and J. J.
Cameron. All the ex-chiefs were present
and helped materially in making the
quests of the club feel at home, in' which
, they were helped considerably by William
I I rquhart, the ex-first chieftain.
Among the guests of the club were: Col
onel Thomas McGrergor of the- Ninth
Cavalry, with headquarters at Fort
Grant. Ariz., who has made it a pleasure
and duty to be present at th- annual
gathering of the clans for the past twelve
years, unless something unforeseen hap
pened t < j prevent him; Supervisor Deasy,
: ex-Supervisor Morton, Sergeant Bethel,
IJeutenant Xash. Billy Jordan. Colonel
Eddy, president of the Phoenix Republi
can flub; James MeXab. Hugh Fraser,
â¢ 'hief li. K. McLellan of the Caledonian
Club, Sacramento; ex-<'hiefs John Mor
rison and David Reid, and others.
The events on the programme were well
contested and called forth the applause
â  of the thousands of people who witnessed
! them. Among the competitors were some
from the Kast and from the Pacific Coast.
An innovation was the linemen's pole-
I climbing contest, which afforded a great
deal of amusement to the spectators. An
exhibition of the sailors' hornipe, given
by Miss Rosie Forbes of Portland, Or.,
and Miss Maggie Bassett of Oakland, was
one erf the most enjoyable features of
the dancing. Miss Bassett took all the
firs/ prizes for dancing, and she showed

YACHTS SPREAD
CANVAS TO A
BRISK BREEZE
Two Regattas Sailed
Yesterday.
The yachtsmen enjoyed a gala rlay on
the bay yesterday. The Corinthians held
their annual club regatta over the usual
channel course; the Californias sailed
their class-flag repatta, and the canoe
ists on Oakland Creek had a sloop race,
a canoe race for the holiday cup. swim
ming races and a general jollification. In
Importance and general interest the Cor
inthian regatta stands first, and though
a somewhat small number of yachts
sailed the course, the race proved both
picturesque and exciting.
The most notable event of the day w;is
the defeat of 'â x-Cdmmudore J. W. Pew's
famous sloop Truant by Commodore Carl
Westerfeld and R. H. Morrow's sloop
Aeolus. The victory of the Corinthian
commodore was exceedingly popular, the
more so as he sailed his own boat and
displayed excellent seamanship through
out the race.
A few seconds after the three whistles
which were the starting signal for the
30-footers the sloop Aeolus crossed the
line, and, standing well in shore, made
for the lirst mark, the Presidio shoal
buoy. This she rounded handily, more
than four minutes ahead of the Truant,
which was set back too far by the tide
and had to make a second attempt. The
advantage thus gained was never lost,
and the flagship crossed the finishing line
4 minutes and S seconds ahead of her ri
val, or taking into account her time al
. lowance of 1 minute and 12 seconds, 5 min
utes and 20 seconds to the good. The fast
est actual time over the course was made
by Vice Commodore W. H. Toepke's
I sloop Harpoon, which covered the thir
! teen nautical miles in 2 hours 55 minutes
i 55 seconds actual time. The only starter
iin class 1 was the sloop Speedwell. In
the 36-foot class the sloop Harpoon won,
with Edna second; the sloop Freda did
not finish, and the sloop Emma was dis
qualified for touching the Presidio shoal
i buoy. After the race a protest was lodged
by E. P. Sagar of the Edna against the
Harpoon for fouling the buoy in round-
I ing it. The weather was not heavy
I enough to suit Frank Bartletfs Queen.
i In the 25-foot class the speedy slope Me
rope proved winner, ana in the 20-loot
I class the Witch was the only starter. A3
the tide was flowing- strongly all the at -
I ternoon there was very little sea. The
1 breeze was at first moderate, but fresn-
I ened considerably during the afternoon.
I No mishaps of any kind occurred, and the
I regatta passed off very suecessrully.
! The committee in charge of the regatta
was made up of T. J. Kavanagh. Dougla-s
Erskine and P. J. Martenstein. The sloop
i Arcturus was used as stakeboat, and,
i with all her signal flags flying, presented
I a pretty sight. After all the yachts had
I crossed the starting line the judge s tug,
with a large party of yachtsmen and la-
I dies on board, steamed out toward the
Presidio shoal buoy, from which, how
ever, she kept a respectful distance so as
to avoid all risk of interfering with the
yachts. Commodore E. A. Wlltsee cruised
i around in the schooner Aggie, while Com
modore T. L. Hill had a large party on
board the San Francisco flagship Cyg
nus.
The California Yacht Club held its an
i nual class flag regatta over the usual
: course yesterday. Starting one and a half
j hours later than the Corinthians, they had
a fine sailing breeze, which freshened to
a strong wind. In class 1 there were two
startersâ the sloops Regina and Vega.
The latter carried away her topmast off
Goat Island on the beat out, but was
pluckily sailed round the course, though
she had no chance of finishing first. In
class 2 there were also two starters â the
sloops Royal and Secret. Both crossed
the line almost together and soon after
the signal. The Secret made twenty sec
onds better time over the course, but the
Royal having an allowance of 1 minute 22
seconds won on corrected time by 1 min
ute 2 seconds. In class 3 there were four
startersâ the sloops Pactolus, Embla and
Occident and the yawl Idler. The Pac
tolus, Embla and Idler crossed the line
almost at the same time and within ten
seconds of their class signal. The Occi
dent lost about three minutes in crossing
I the starting- line and later on lost three or
four minutes more by yielding the right of
way, according to the sailing order of the
day, to a Corinthian boat at Blossom
Rock buoy, which was one of the marks
in both regattas. The loss of time, how
ever, made no difference In the result, as
her corrected time was 22 minutes 25 sec
onds slower than that of Commodore Al
len M. Clay's Pactolus, which beat the
Embla, her nearest rival, by 2 minutes 17
seconds. The course was estimated at
ten nautical miles. The regatta commit
tee consisted of B. W. Robson, J. W.
Homer and H. W. Seebach.
On Sessions basin. East Oakland, the
Canoe Club kept open house all day. The
swimming race, 220 yards, was won by C.
L. Taylor Jr.. and the tub race by G. G.
Williamson. The sloop race was won by
Charles Stewart's Beatrice and the Holi
day cup by C. S. Myrick in the canoe
Pirate, C. L. Taylor Jr. being second in
the canoe Nereid and R. B. Bain Jr. third
in the canoe Vitesse. The sloop Beatrice
took out two or three parties for a cruise
on the creek and Commodore Philip
Caduc entertained visitors on his sloop
Annie, the flagship of the club. After
dinner the boathouse was illuminated and
a dance was enjoyed. Among the mem
bers and visitors present were the fol
lowing:
Commodore Philio Caduc, Mrs. anil Miss
Marchebout, Miss Kate and Miss Nellie Calnes,

GOLCHER WINS A TROPHY
BEST MARKSMAN OF THE AMA
TEUR BRIGADE.
For the Third Successive Time Nau
man Captures the Association's
Individual Champion
ship Medal.
AXTIOCH. May 30.â This was a remark
ably fine day for bluerock shootingâ
scarcely any wind and the weather balmy.
The whole town turned out to witness the
events of the closing day of the seventh
tournament of the California Inanimate
Target Association. Several crack shots
who failed to get here for the first day 'a
shooting arrived and participated in to
day's events.
The feature to-day was the shooting of
what was termed the awkward squad.
This was composed of men who had never
before shot at sailing clay saucers. As
semblyman Bel.shaw received the trophy
in this event, but it is said that Phil
Bekeart's green jacket, which was
loaned to Belshaw for the occasion, wa.s
the mascot that enabled him to win. The
shooting of the awkward squad was to
the tournament what the clown is to a
circus, and it created a great deal of fun.
The target smashers are more than,
pleased with their treatment at the hands
of the local clubs and the people of An
tioch. Last night they were amused at
a show by Zamloch. the conjuror, and
to-night they were forgetting loved ones
at home while basking in the smiles of
Antioch's fairest at a dance given in their
honor in the pavilion by the Antioch Gun
Club. Many of the marksmen left for
home on the Stockton steamer to-night
after the dance.
For the San Francisco Gun Club trophy,
twenty singles, Dr. Hyde, Mr. Ricklefsen
and O". Feudner each took 20 straight. In
the shoot-off Feudner and Hyde smashed
15 each and Ricklefsen brought down 14.
In the shoot-off between Hyde and Feud
ner Hyde scored 20 straight and Feudner
15. Thus Hyde became the winner of the
second trophy also. The Fresno man did
remarkably well in carrying off the two
trophies against such a strong field.
The third event was the Golcher Indi
vidual trophy, twenty singles. Joe Ross.
Nauman and Schultz tied with clean
scores of 20 straight. In the shoot-off
Ross broke IS. Nauman 18 and Schultz 15,
and in the shoot-off between Ross and
Nauman, Nauman beat Ross. Nauman
afterward acknowledged that in the sec
ond contest he was credited with one
saucer that he never touched, so the
trophy was awarded to Ross of Antioch.
For "the California Inanimate Target As
sociation individual championship medal,
at twenty singles. Hyde smashed 19, Nau
man 19, Hobson 19 and Olsen 19. In the
shoot-off Hyde and Nauman knocked
down 16 each, the others 12 each, and in
the contest between Nauman and Dr.
Hyde the former won by a score of 15 to
14 They had been at a great nervous
strain, and that accounts for the low
Â«core- besides, just as they shot the wind
blew harder than at any other time to
day This is the third time Nauman has
won the medal, and it is now his perma
nently. In each of the last three tourna
ments he has battled for it manfully, and
his opponent in to-day's contest. Dr
Hyde, was the first to grasp his hand and
offer 'congratulations.

PADEREWSKI DIDN'T
MARRY HIS SISTER
Sensational Press Led Into a
Cortical Error Concerning
the Pianist
PARIS, May HO.â The agents here of Ignace Jan Paderewski, the
Oelebrated Russian pianist, declare there is no truth in the report that
Paderew&kJ had married the former wife of Ladislas GorsffH-the violin
ist. The lady, it is added, is Paderewski's sister.
A cable dispatch from Paris was printed in the United States on Sun
day last, in which it whs stated that Paderewski was 9ecretly married
last December. Confirmation of the statement was given in the fact
that Mine. (Jorski, when In Geneva recently, registered at the Casino as
Elena Paderewski. The dispatch added that Paderewski, who has been
a widower for several years, was attracted to Mme. Gorski by reason of
her kindness toward his invalid son. The story went 'on to say that
Mme. Gorski and Paderewski were living quietly in Paris together await
ing the Pope's dispensation before having an ecclesiastical marriage. This
dispensation, however, was said to be unnecessary, as the lady's mar
riage to Gorski was Illegal, having been without the consent of
parents, as the Polish laws require.

dian, and the procession dispersed. The
hour which followed was given over to

Until well into the evening the people
of the Portuguese settlemeut and the
hundreds of visitors from the surrounding

in a great hall built on tho ground, over
which the American Hag fluttered in the
south breeze^ while outside bombs boomed
and skyrockets burst in the air.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, MAY 31, 1899.
CITY OF TENTS
GROWS LARGER
Adventists Gathering in
Numbers.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
STOCKTON, May 30.â The Adventists
I are arriving at their camp meeting
grounds by every kind of transporta
tion, ancient and modern. Large num
! bers have come by train, others arrived
;by boat this morning and during the
. day several of the old-fashioned prairie
schooners brought in zealous members
of the sect.
The meeting partakes of the nature
\ of the old-fashioned backwoods gather
ing and of a modern camp. The place
is complete in all of its appointments.
! The main tent is to be lighted by elec
; tricity and nearly two thousand com
fortable chairs are arranged around the
large platform to be occupied by the
â¢ heir, the elders and the speakers. A
baggage tent has been established and
was doing a great ouslness all day.
; Hundreds of trunks and boxes, together
; with every conceivable kind of baggage,
! was delivered there by the transporta
tion co-mpany and later distributed
through the tented city.
A choir of seventy-five voices selected
from the various churches of the Cali
fornia conference is being" organized to
lead the singing. Musical instruments
are plentiful throughout the camp. The
large tents are occupied by the confer
! ence officers, the book store, the Healds
burg College delegates and the kinder
garten for the children.
One of the most noteworthy persona
at the conference is Elder J. N. Lough
borouffh, who has been identified with
j the church since 1849 and has contrib
| uted a great deal to the literature of his
! people.
The first service was held this even
ing and was in the nature "i a prayer
meeting- The 5 o'clock bell to-morrow
will really signalize the opening of the
conference.
On the morning boats large delega
tions will arrive from the bay cities,
where the Adventists have their largest
churches. The camp and the meetings
I are open to all, but the managers of the
conference insist that every one shall
respect the regulations. Peddlers or
venders of any sort are prohibited
; from entering the grounds. Tobacco,
coffee, tea or meat are not in evidence,
! and it may truthfully be said that the
inhabitants of the place do not look as
j though they had suffered physically by
j having tabooed these articles. It is the
j intention of the people to continue the
! camp meeting after the expiration of
i the ten days if there is sufficient local
I interest to justify it.
The conference assemblage will be
I distinct from the general camp meeting,
â  inasmuch as the participants will be
j limited to a certain number of dele
i gates from each church in good stand
| ing. The women are fully represented
i among the lay delegates. The camp was
a surprise in size and in appointment
! to the several thousand persons who
, visited it to-day. â¢

When we consider thÂ« number of people who

widden "death and all the pain, misery, dis-
comfort and loss of time and pleasure, in life

there really is a cure for the malady.

marvelous rupture cure that restores you to
permanent freedom from rupture.
It Is a home cure, safe, painless, without

art of kindness will be remembered by those
who suffer With the great affliction' of rupture. ,
there were present representatives from
the lodges at Sacramento, San Francisco,
San Jose and Oakland, among som? of
the prominent delegate? being San Fran
clsco's County Recorder, Attorney Ko
walsky, Attorney Crowley, who is prime
mover with the knights of Pythias; Dep
uty Recorder Bohr of San Francisco, who
Is also president of the Eagle Lodge in
the metropolis. A report was read from
the representatives of these lodges, who
attended the Grand Lodge .in Seattle on
the 6th inst.. and the report teemed with
charges of a most sensational nature,
questioning the character and reputation
of some of the grand officers.
"Why, do you know the representatives
termed the grand officers a disreputable
crowd," said President James Taylor of
the Oakland lodge, who attended the San
Francisco conference, "and the Seattle
papers commented most unfavorably upon
the whole affair. Bo we decided that the
term Eagle is one that every true Ameri
can should look up to. and we did not
propose to allow the name to be smirched
by such an element as prevails m be
attle. Hence the conference was held to
perpetuate the name Eagles in an honor
able way."
\fter a three hours' consultation at tne
conference a committee of eleven was ap
pointed, with Attorney Crowley as chair
man, to prepare articles of incorpora
tion for a new order to be known as the
"Bohemian American Eagles." This com
mittee was instructed to rile the neces
sary articles Immediately and have the
documents ready for the formation of a
"grand nest" in San Francisco next Bun
day afternoon.
Oakland Lodge is th< first to withdraw
from the old order. At its meeting last
r.ighi President Taylor stated, in a stir
nng speech, that as presiding officer he
vould be bound to r.how respect to the
grand officers, but he thought the lodge
could not expect him to take those officers
out in carriages and introduce them to
Mayor Snow. "Oakland Lodge," he con
tinued, "does not wish to smirch its repu
tation a> j;onii citizens by being controlled
bj an organization of such characters. 1
As a result Oakland Lodge, which was
organized last March with ins members,
among whom are some of this city's most
prominent merchants and professional
men, by a unanimous vote surrendered its
charter, and fifty-four names were signed
tr- the roll for membership in the new
sect of Eagles.
The principles of the proposed "Bo
hemian American Eagle?" will be strict
ly American in patriotism, Bohemian in
liberality and good fellowship. No one
can become a member except American
citizens of good moral character, good
standing in th" community, irrespective
of religion, politics or profession.
The appropriate titles of the officers of
the Grand Nest will be as follows: Grand
golden eagle, past president: grand gray
eagle, presiding officer; grand black eagle,
vice president;- grand sacred eagle, chap
lain; grand recording eagle, secretary;
grand guardian of the nest, treasurer;
grand left wing, inside guard; grand right
wing, outside guard; grand guiding eagle,
conductor.

RITCHIE'S HORRIBLE DEATH.
Freight Clerk Struck by an Engine
and His Head Severed From
the Body.
OAKLAND, May 30.â Homer E. Ritchie,
ti Biding with his widowed sister, Mrs.
Voight, at 815 Henry street, was run over
and killed by a switch engine at the
Peralta -street freight yard shortly after
H o'clock this morning, his head being
severed from the body.
Ritchie was a clerk in the freight office
of the Southern Pacific Company and
had just left the platform of the freight
transfer sheds to take a handful of bills
to the office. While walking between the
tracks, evidently deep in thought, switch
engine No. 1051 backing down the track
struck him. notwithstanding Switchman
Albert Pool, who was standing on the
step of the engine, called loudly warning
him. Two wheels of the tender passed
O'ler his head and neck before the engine
could be stopped. Deceased was a single
man. aged 40 years. The Inquest will be
held to-morrow night.
O'SULLIVAN'S IRISH
SONG RECITATION
"Vnien a song recital in San Francisco
draws a parked, fashionable audience on
the night of a holiday the attraction is
something- unusual. The Sherman & Clay
Hall was uncomfortably crowded last
night when Dennis O'Sullivan sang. The
programme was made up entirely of Jrish
songs and the singer was In the best of
voice and (spirits. Nobody else sings these
songs as lie does, and it is small wonder
that the concertgoers and critics of Ire
land aad England bave granted him first
platie in this specialty. Whether it be in
the melodramatic, humorous sentimental
or patriotic songs of Ireland, Mr. O'Sul
llvan gives them for all that they are
worth. He brings the character out of
every one.
The programme commenced with a
brace of songs from Stanford'!* "Shamtis
O'Brien" that brought welcome souvenirs
of O'BulHvan's big success In the title
part of that opera. Needhain and Lover
were well represented in the programme
and there was a group of ballads by Tom
Moore and another of folk Bongs arranged
Iby Charles Wood. It is :i pity that Mr
O'Sullivan cannot give another recital
prior to his departure for Europe. Many
of hi 6 friends were unable to get tickets
for last night. H. J. Stewart contributed
admirable accompaniments on the piano
forte and altogether the concert was an
artistiu and social success.

MORE SALOONS
MAY SOON BE
CLOSED DOWN
Council Has Set Up
a Precedent.
! PROTESTS WILL PREVAIL
SEVEN DRAMSHOPS IN A BLOCK
SAID TO BE TOO MANY.
I Councilman Girard Reminds His As
sociates That He Was Opposed
by Liquor Men at the Last
Election.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, May 30.
Not for ten years has the saloon busi
ness received such a shock as It was
I given last night, when the City Council
I decided that whenever a substantial pro
test Is presented against a license it will
not be granted. The extremists are al
ready declaring that In this manner Oak
land can soon be made a prohibition
town.
The fight on the floor of the Council
was very determined. Two ministers and
an ex-Judge led the protestants, and the
applicants and Councilmen Mott and
Schaefor acted in harmony. Councilman
Stetson clinched matters for the West
Oakland applicants yesterday by stating
that there are now seven saloons within
â¢a radius of one block from where the ap
plicant resides, and that there )b no need
for eight. This license was for a now sa
loon and was denied.
The case of the Union Bar of East
Oakland Is somewhat different. The place
has been licensed for thirty years and has
only recently been complained against. An
organized tight has been made against
i the renewal of the license, on the ground
! that It is a residence district. This pro
test also prevailed. Now them Is a reel
ing of unrest among many other saloon
keepers whose licenses will soon expire.
Especially is the case in the Seventh
Ward, where the Union Bar Is located,
as at the last special election to decide for
or against saloons tills ward was the only
one that gave a majority against the
liquor traffic.
Councilmen Girard, Upton, Rowe,
Cuvellier and Stetson are already on rec
ord as being opposed to granting licenses
when a protest is presented, and if they
I can depend on one more vote they oan do
!as they please. Mr. Girard made a very
significant remark when he said that the
I saloon men had fought him at the polls.
| but that the decent element had elected
t him. and he intended to stand by his
supporters. Tt is well known that there
: are several licenses slated for a denial of
| a reissue.
CLASS TENNIS AT
CALIFORNIA CLUB
Clever Racket Wielders Play for
Prizes and Honors.
The class tournament In singles of the
I California Tennis Club attracted all the
local racket wielders to the courts yes
terday morning and afternoon. The sec
! ond and third class entries wound up their
! matches, so nothing: remains but the
round robin interelas* contests between
the winners of the separate classes.
The entries for the first class were
limited in number, being confined to the
Whitney brothers, Robert and George.
Robert Whitney defaulted to his brother,
leaving George to contest the champion
ship rights with Salisbury, the winner of
the third class, and with George Brad
shaw, the winner of the second class.
These three class champions will fight
it out among themselves in a round
robin, next Sunday being the day selected
for their meeting.
Some little difficulty and contention oc
curred In regard to the first class
matches. James A. Code, who represent-
I ed Werner Stauf as one of the committee
on the tournament, wanted the two Whit
neys to compete in the second class, as
they were the only players' entered in the
first class. The Whitneys refused point
i blank, and Code finally surrendered. Rob
ert Whitney did not play, and this left
George the champion of his own special
class. - - '
The preliminary matches of the second
class resulted as follows: H. E. Bunnett
defaulted to Code; Bradshaw beat Drum
mond McGavln, 6â2, 7â5. McGavin, al
though one of the youngest players on
the courts, is rapidly rising to the top of
the tennis ladder and will soon be among
i the first class players. Bradshaw's vie-
I tory was won by hard work. He is the
I best second class player In the Califor
nia Club. Dr. C. B. Root beat Grant
Smith, 6â4, 4â6, 6â3, after a most inter
esting match. R. J. Davis and alter
McGavin drew a bye, McGavin -winning
' out, Iâ6. c â 6â3. Harry Weihe default
i ed to Walter McGavin.
The semi-finals produced some excellent
i tennis. Bradshaw defeated Code in two
! straight sets, the first. 6â3, giving him
Ino apparent labor. The second set was
: -won. Bâ6. after a protracted struggle.
Walter McGavin defaulted to Dr. Root.
i The finals between Dr. Root and George
: Bradshaw proved an easy victory for
i Bradshaw, the score reading 6â2. 6â3.
The preliminaries of the third class
were: Beal defaulted to Mann; Henly
! was defeated by Cornell, 6â2, 6â3. John
i son defeated Mann, 6âo, .Bâ 6; Salisbury
! defeated C. Smith, 5â7. 6â3, 6â4; Broem
i mcl defeated Fuller, 6â 4, 6â3, and Cornell
' defeated Moore, 6â 2, 7â The semi-finals
were victories for Salisbury over John
son who defaulted, and Cornell over
Bro'emmel, 6â2, 6âl. The finals of the
third class went to Salisbury, who de
i feated Cornell in two straight sets,
6-0, 7-5. . - . â â ' ;' : â â â¢-. 'â  .

DEMOCRATIC HEADS
MAY BE CUT OFF
Revenue Collector Lynch Said to Be
About to Make Numerous
Removals.
LOS ANGELES. May HO.â John C.
Lynch, Internal Revenue Collector, who
holds the most profitable Federal position
in the State, will to-morrow attend the
annual meeting of the Sixth District Ag
ricultural Fair Association and will suc
ceed himself by unanimous consent as
president of that organization. It is said
to-night a resolution will be introduced
at the meeting of the association that will
forever bar coursing, on the grounds.
This movement has the hearty indorse
ment of the directors.
The fact is apparent from the anxiety
on the part of many politicians that the
presence of Lynch is of greater Import
than surface ripples indicate. It is said
by Lynch's Intimate friends that Presi
dent McKinley's recent order will give the
Collector an opportunity to fill a great
many places In San Francisco and Los
Angeles, now held by Democrats, with Re
publicans. The first that will go are the

JAMAICA'S LEGISLATURE
FAVORS RECIPROCITY
Three Delegates Will Be Sent to
Washington to Confer as to
Terms.
Special Cable to The Call and the New York
Herald. Copyrighted, 1599, by James Gor
don Bennett.
KINGSTON, Jamaica, May 30.â The
Legislature to-day decided to send three
delegates to Washington to discuss
reciprocity arrangements. They will go
with clear instructions from Mr. Cham
berlain that reciprocity cannot be enter
tained if an appreciable loss of revenue
be involved, as appears to him inevitable.
The Governor announced later that he
was opening correspondence with the Ca
nadian Government to establish a direct
quick steamship service between Canada
and Jamaica for the development; of
trade. The Legislature gave an assur
ance of a substantial subsidy. Trade de
pendence on the United States was felt to
be perilous, and the present tariff menace
is causing Jamaica to look for hope to
Canada. It is feared the United States
tariff will at no distant date exclude Ja
maica fruit in favor of Cuba and Porto
Rico. Money was voted for the estab
lishment of a West Indian trade agency
in Ottawa.
The Legislature also adopted resolutions
stating that owing to the adoption by the
United States of countervailing duties,
sugar cultivation should be saved from
actual extermination, and calling on the
imperial Government to act in unison
with the United States as the largest
two sugar-consuming markets in the
world to bring about an .abolition of
bounties.

KALBEN DESERTS THE SOLID SEVEN

The Market-Street Company Defeated in Its Infamous Attempt
to Kill Competition and to Make the City Its
Prey for Fifty Years.
Sensational Develop
ments in the Scheme
of the Railroad to
Grab the Streets of
the City,
THE Southern Pacific Company
and the Market Street Company
have been defeated In their effort
to make the < -ity their prey for
rifty years. The franchise which
these corporations attempted to secure
by corrupt means will not be granted
by the Board of Supervisors. The peo
ple of San Francisco have won a vic
tory which in its effects and general
benefits is perhaps without parallel in
local history. All the powers of the
railroad, from the blackguardism of
its ruffian employes to the 1 ribery of
its twisted corruptionists, have. gone
for nothing. The "solid Beven" in the
Board <>f Supervisors have lost one of
their members, and their loss deprives
them of their Â«-vil power to injure the
< ity.
Supervisor E. C. Kalben has deserted
the s.'ljd seven and has allied himself
with the honest members of the board
who so stubbornly and cleverly pre
vented the bought agents <>f the rail
road from earning their price of shame
from their masters. Supervisor Kal
ben will vote against all of the out
rageous demands of the Southern Pa

Company. His position in connection
with recent events is a unique one and

feeder have feared a defection in the
ranks of the solid seven, and in threat

if their demands were not granted by
the Supervisors a bitter attack would
be made in the courts upon the charter.
But boasts frequently attain no se
rious importance, and at all events the
city will not be burdened by the weight
of railroad monopoly for fifty years.
And the victory has been won without
a resort to extraordinary legislative
measures.
Mayor Phelan will not have to exer
cise his great power and refuse to call
a meeting of the Supervisors until af

GENERAL BARNES IS
OUT OF POLITICS
WILL NEVER AGAIN BE A CAN
DIDATE FOR U. S. SENATOR.
Politicians Are Wondering Why
Governor Gage Does Not Issue
a Senatorial Commission
to D. M. Burns.
"Whfin General W, H. L. Barnes packed i
up his traps at Sacramento after the
Legislature finished the balloting for I
United States Senator he declared that '
he was out of politics forever and would j
never make another speech which did not |
begin with the words, "May it please your
Honor." Some of the politicians fancied
that the orator's utterances were due to
a sudden warmth of feeling inspired by j
the occasion . and would be recalled after;
calm deliberation. The general has not '
yet changed his mind on this topic. He
says now:
"I shall never be a candidate for the
Senatorial or any other office. I am glad
1 was not elected last winter and I would
not attend another session of the Legis- i
lature if 1 could be assured the Senator
ship for the rest of my life."
The politicians are still wondering why
D. M. Burns does not receive his Sena
torial commission from Governor Gage.
One man who professes sincere friendship
for Burns made this remark at the
Palace:
"If 1 were in Burns' place I would go to
the Governor and ask for the commission.
Burns, with a commission in hand, would
be in a position to meet Senator Quay
and submit to him that they had a com
mon fight. They could pull together to
secure a sufficient number of votes in the
Senate to admit them to seats."
It is the talk among the politicians that

Labor Commissioner and probably the

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, MAY 31, 1899.
RAILROAD EMPLOYES
HOLD THEIR OUTING
SPENT DECORATION DAY AT LOS
GATOS PARK.
The Pleasure-Seekers Taxed the
Broad-Gauge Accommodations to
Their Utmost Capacity.
The employes of the local freight office
of the Southern Pacific Company- held
their sixth annual excursion and outing
yesterday at Los Galos Park. The affair
was perhaps tlu> brst attended and most
enjoyable of any held by tho railroad em
ployes in years. Fully 4000 people, most of
whom were young folks, journeyed down
to the little town at the foot of the Santa
t'luz Mountains and whlled away the
pleasant hours dancing, strolling in the
foothills and participating in the games
The picnic was the largest that has been
held in Los Gatos for some time, and the
broad gauge was taxed to the utmost to
accommodate the merry crowd The
train which transported the excursionists
to the picnic grounds was divided into
five sections, each following closely on the
other.
The picnic grounds with the moving
throng of pleasure seekers clad in outing
costunftfl of variegated hues presented a
gala spectacle. It seemed as If each and
every member of the freight department
was trying to outrival the other in wear
ing tropical raiment. Andrew Kasten the
popular representative of the auditing de
partment, presented himself on the floor
or tli>- pavilion arrayed like a rainbow
tinted nightmare, and were it not for the
unexpected appearance of "Jim" Symons
clad in a shirt which resembled the
Aurora Borealis, Kasten would have
easily carried off the- laurels. Symons'
shirt, which was a symphony in sunset
red. made so much noise that Floor Man
ager Lou Fortune good-naturedly re
quested Jim to hie himself far up on the
:: uw of tho hill. Thirsty farmers sat
feasting their eyes on the. white-aproned
waiters skin Tying about the picnic
grounds vvith large trays of liquid re

A Revolution in the
Board of Supervisors
Saves San Francisco
From a Reign of Cor
ruption.
the city. The fangs of the majority
have been drawn. Six members of the
j board have called forth upon them
: selves the scorn and contempt of de
cent men, and they have for their pains
only their own shame. They have been
bought, and the purchase price will not
be paid, for the Southern Pacific Com
pany never pays anything for nothing.
The exciting scenes at the session of
the Board of Supervisors on Monday
were the topic of general conversation
J yesterday in all local circles. Never
I before had such a determined struggle
! against official corruption been made in
San Francisco. Never before had such
a signal success crowned the endeavors
of those that fought for the public wel
fare. In the comment and criticism of
the action of the Supervisors the names
of two members of the board were used
: almost incessantly.
One of these members was E. C. Kal
ben, s"ome of whose friends declared
that they could not understand the
stand he had taken in voting with the
six men whose names now constitute
a. shameful roll. Kal.Den's friends pro
tested that his position was to them a
mystery. If this was true Supervisor
Kaibon has cleared it away. He has
addressed to the public an open letter
in which he declares that he has been
misunderstood in his Intentions and in
his actions. He says that he never in
tended to vote for any of the franchises
asked by the Southern Pacific Company
and the Market Street Company, and
certainly did not do so.
He calls attention to the fact that
absolutely no vote was taken upon the
franchises themselves. The first and
j only material vote in reference to the
j outrageous demands of the railroads
was taken upon the motion to refer the
recommendations of the Street Commit
tee back again for further considera
tion. Such a reference. Supervisor Kal
ben declares, was unnecessary and a
useless loss of time. He says that he
had determined to vote against the
franchises and he saw no reason why
the vote should not be taken at once
as well as later. This is the reason he
gives for his vote, and with the reason
he gives an absolute assurance that
when the matter is again before the
Board of Supervisors next Monday he
will vote against the grant of all or any
of the franchises.
This means that the atrocious meas
ures will be defeated. The railroad
people, with all their power, cannot
control more than six votes. They have
reached such a desperate stage in their
evil fight that they have not hesitated
to slander one of the men who fought
so persistently in behalf of the city.
This man is Supervisor Albert Heyer,
who enjoys an unsullied name as a pub
lic official of long experience. When ru
mors began to circulate that the solid
seven could not be held together and
that the railroad might expect defeat
Henry Lynch of the Market Street
Company shrugged his shoulders, and
with a sneer said that whenever the
railroad wanted the vote of Albert
Heyer it would get the vote.
This unwarranted and absolutely
fals." assertion has been indignantly de
nied by the friends <>f Supervisor Hey
er. In the following interview Super
visor Heyer tells emphatically what he
intends to do in reference to any future

joyable outing of the season.

Dear Madam: "Pegamoid says come!
You're welcome, Chronicle building:, No. 61.
consideration of the franchises:
I will oppose the granting of the
proposed franchises to the Market
Street Bailway Company as long as
I have a vote in the board. This
appears to me to be an instance
where the interests of the city are at
stake, and as I consider myself mere
ly a servant of the people I hold it
to be my duty that I should do all
that I oan to advance and protect the
welfare of the people. If the needs
of the city demand that there shall
be street railroads over the streets
where franchises are asked for I see
no good reason why a delay of six
months should work any hardship on
the persons or corporations seeking
the franchises.
Certain benefits will accrue to the
city by reason of the provisions of
the new charter. These benefits be
long to the city and should be pre
served for it by the members of the
Board of Supervisors. On Monday I
voted against the attempt to grant
the proposed franchises and I shall
continue so to vote to the end of the
chapter.
These 'words of Supervisor Heyer
show that when corruption cannot buy
votes slander certainly will not. Lynch's
remarks have naturally created indig
nation and protest. Lynch is the man
who packed the assembly chamber of
the Supervisors on Monday with rail
road loafers, who waited for an oppor
tunity to use intimidation. Their offen
sive presence, however, was no more
serious than a hiss.
With defeat staring them in the face
the railroad people intend to adopt new
tactics. They threaten to use every
possible means, corrupt and otherwise,
to defeat the operation of the charter.
If the new- charter goes into effect and
the gigantic steal of the Geary-street
franchise is not effected before July
1 it is among the possibilities, if not
the probabilities, that the city may own
the Geary Street Railroad and operate
it. This would be the beginning of the
municipal ownership of railroads and
would be the commencement of a for
midable competition to the monopoly
of the Market Street Company.
This will illustrate the enormous
value of the rights which the Market
Street Company has attempted to steal
from San Francisco. If the theft can
not be accomplished through the Board
of Supervisors the ruilroad people de
clare that it will be through the courts
by defeating the operation of the new
charter. The threat of the Southern
Pacific Company to exercise its influ
ence in the courts to cheat the people
out of the benefits of the charter is by
no means a new one, and many well
informed people have reason to believe
that no serious consequences will fol
low the threat.
It is looked upon as an idle boast of
men angry at their inability to win in
evil triumph, although they have at
their command and are using every
artifice and corruption, from intimida
tion and the boycott to bribery. The
announcement of Kalben that he will
vote against the franchises is the pledge
that the people of San Francisco have
won a great victory.
GREAT WORK
OF THE BAPTIST
MISSIONARIES
Spread of Christianity
Westward.
The Baptist anniversary week is draw
ing to a close and the various national
organizations of the denomination that
have been holding sessions in the First
Baptist Church of this city since last
Wednesday are rapidly completing the
work that brought them to the Pacific
coast. Yesterday afternoon marked the
completion of the labors of the Ameri
can Baptist Missionary Union, and the
sessions of the American Baptist Home
Mission Society, which began last even
ing, will continue through to-day and to
morrow forenoon, when the work of the
general conference will be completed and
a linal adjournment taken.
The Â»flrst session of the American Bap
tist Home Mission Society last evening
marked the sixty-seventh anniversary of
that organization. Owing to the unavoid
able absence of President Stephen Greene
<if Massachusetts, O. M. Thresher of Day
ton, Ohio, presided. The session was
opened with a prayer by Rev. Dr. Willey,
a Congregational clergyman who is a
pioneer of the Pacific coast.
Mr Thresher delivered a short address
and then introduced T. J. Morgan, cor
responding secretary, who read the re
port of the executive board for the year
just closed. The report shows that the
society has a surplus of $40,890 in the
treasury, $35,0<K) of which has been set
aside as an emergency fund. This favor
able financial showing is due to the lib
erality of churches and individuals, but
more especially to the exceptionally large
sums, amounting to $100,000, liberated
from the annuity fund by the decease of
Mrs. M. M. Gray of Oakland and Deacon
Martin E. Gray of Wllloughby, Ohio.
The feature of the report Is the an
nouncement that Cuba and Porto Rico
have been transferred from the control
of the Foreign Mission Society to the
Home Mission Society. The loading of
the report was followed by the announce
ment of the various nominating commit
tees bi' the president.
Rev. Dr. H. L. Morehouse of Now York,
field secretary of the society, read '& long
and decidedly interesting paper entitled
"Fifty Years' Work on the Pacific Coast."
Among other things he said:
"Wise men were our ancestors, but poor
prophets. Little did they drao.il of a con
vocation like this in a city like this on
the Pacific slope at the pikl of the century
in which they lived. Their estimates of
what this West was worth and what it
would become went wide of the mark."
He traced the westward movement of
Christian civilization across the continent
and referring to the part the Baptist
church has had in developing this section
said:
"From the first it has been the great
pioneer evangelistic organization, fts early
exploration missionaries being practically
Baptist bishops or overseers, for whole
territories, and its local missionaries hav
ing numerous out-stations in order that
t*ie largest possible territory might be
brought under Christian influence." He
spoke in glowing terras of the work ac
complished and in conclusion said:
"For this ultimate result have we
wrought the last fifty years; to this we
regirci ourselves for fifty years to come
so that this West, conquered for Christ,
may go forth with augmented power to
conquer the world for him."
An invitation from Irving M. Scott to
visit the battleship lowa Thursday after
noon was accepted.
